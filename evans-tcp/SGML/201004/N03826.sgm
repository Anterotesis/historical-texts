<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to your De&s;ire I now &s;end you &s;ome Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> GAR|DEN'S LETTERS to the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD, which you may either <HI>publi&s;h</HI> or &s;uppre&s;s, as you think they de&s;erve.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of an endeavour to prove Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> guilty of a Self-Contradiction, founded upon what he &s;aith in his Sermon <HI>Entitled,</HI> <Q><HI>What think ye of Chri&s;t.</HI> pag. 18. <HI>viz.</HI> Ob&s;erve my Dear Brethren the Words of the Article, Good Works are the Fruits of Faith, <HI>and follow after Ju&s;tification.</HI> How then can they <HI>precede,</HI> or be any ways the cau&s;e of it? No; our Per&s;ons mu&s;t be Ju&s;tified before our Performances are <HI>Accepted</HI></Q> Upon which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> ob&s;erves, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> (hath ex|plain'd) this Article into a Contradiction to his own Doctrine, &s;ince he hath taught, <HI>that a true Faith nece&s;&s;arily preceeds Ju&s;ti|fication;</HI> and the latter part of the Article &s;aith, <HI>that Good Works do nece&s;&s;arily &s;pring out of a true and lively Faith.</HI> From
<PB N="2" REF="004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0">both which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> thinks it will follow, that Good Works do in fact go <HI>before Ju&s;tification.</HI> The Argument is all con|tained in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> "Now if Good Works do ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;pring out of a true and lively Faith; and a true and lively Faith nece&s;&s;arily preceeds Ju&s;tification, the con&s;e|quence will be, that <HI>Good Works do not only follow after Ju&s;ti|fication, but preceed it al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>This he a&s;&s;ures us is a plain Con&s;equence. But I am apt to think it is a plain Con&s;equence to none, who have not that <HI>Scotch Second-Sight</HI> he &s;peaks of; i. e. an Ability of &s;eeing that which is not. Indeed if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had &s;aid, that <HI>Faith nece&s;&s;arily preceeds Ju&s;tification</HI> any <HI>&s;pace</HI> of <HI>Time, tho' ever &s;o &s;mall,</HI> he would have owned in Effect that Good Works <HI>go before Ju&s;tification as well as follow it;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> might have &s;ang <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um</HI> with a much better <HI>Grace</HI> than he doth at pre&s;ent. The whole turns upon this &s;ingle Point: If Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> hath &s;aid, that Faith preceeds Ju&s;tification, any real &s;pace of Time; <HI>Actum e&s;t;</HI> he mu&s;t fall before his Adver&s;ary. But if he doth not hold this Thing, the Commi&s;&s;ary triumphs without any Victory.</P>
<P>Now what Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> holds, as to Faith's preceeding Ju&s;tification, this Reverend Gentleman tells us him&s;elf. In pag. 19. he &s;aith, <Q>That &s;ome &s;ew, who di&s;turb, in&s;ult and abu&s;e their Neighbours for differing from them (meaning Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and others) &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Faith and Ju&s;tifica|tion are coexi&s;tent,</HI></Q> and <HI>that there is no &s;pace between the fir&s;t Act of a ju&s;tifying Faith and Ju&s;tification for Good Works to be exerted in.</HI> That is in other Words, that Faith <HI>preceeds</HI> Ju&s;tifi|cation, not in Time, but only in the order of <HI>Conception.</HI> Well then, this being Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Idea <HI>of Faith's preceeding Ju&s;tification,</HI> (his Enemy him&s;elf being Judge) wherein doth it appear that he hath explained the Article into a <HI>Contradiction to him&s;elf?</HI> Doth it follow that becau&s;e he holds <HI>Faith and Ju&s;tification to be coexi&s;tent</HI> that therefore they are <HI>not coexi&s;tent;</HI> that becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es there is no room for Good Works to be exerted in between them, that therefore he &s;uppo&s;es there is &s;ome room for them? If the&s;e are no Con&s;equences, then Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is no Conqueror. How naturally might his own Words be returned to him again! <HI>Away with &s;uch con|fu&s;ed and contradictory Gibberi&s;h!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0">
Surely this Man of Logick, when he comes to &s;ee there was no <HI>Knot</HI> at <HI>all,</HI> will <HI>wi&s;h he had been A&s;leep when he challenged Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>to untie it if he could;</HI> and be heartily <HI>a&s;ham'd of this &s;ame confident boa&s;ting.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <HI>Second</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Whitefield</HI> having given this <HI>Gentleman</HI> to under&s;tand that <HI>be</HI> was too warm for a Di&s;pute; and de&s;it'd him to peru&s;e the Sermon again, and confute it in <HI>Print</HI> if he could. He An&s;wers in his Second Letter, <Q>That he is free from Warmth, and not willing to be put off in a Mat|ter which was of &s;o much Importance to his own Soul, and the Souls of his People: and therefore tells him what he hath firmly believed, and taught his People, be&s;eeching him in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner to re&s;tore him, if <HI>therein</HI> he hath departed from the Go&s;pel, and the Articles of his own Church.</Q></P>
<P>What he firmly believes and hath always taught his Peo|ple, he faith is this, <Q>That Good Works do as nece&s;&s;arily &s;pring from a true and lively Faith, whither before or after Ju&s;tification as Light and Heat do the Sun</Q> It is well worth the while to Inquire here what he means by a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lively Faith.</HI> And this he tells us very hone&s;tly in Pag 9. Line 1. <HI>That it is a Faith actually producing Good Works.</HI> This then being the &s;ettled meaning of a true and lively Faith, if we con&s;ider aright, we &s;hall find that the amount of what he u&s;hers in with &s;o much Solemnity, is only this; <HI>viz.</HI> That he hath always <HI>firmly</HI> believed, and taught his Hearers, that <HI>Good Works always &s;pring from the Faith that produceth Good Works;</HI> or to be plainer &s;till; that the Faith <HI>which produceth</HI> Good Works, <HI>produceth</HI> Good Works; than which it is impo&s;|&s;ible any thing &s;hould be <HI>more Orthodox,</HI> or <HI>le&s;s In&s;tructive.</HI> 'Tis needle&s;s for him to de&s;ire to be &s;et more right in this Matter: Nay as he hath always taught his Hearers this Doc|trine, &s;o let him teach it to them &s;till, for tho' it will do them no manner of Good, it may do them <HI>le&s;s</HI> Harm than other Doctrines they might hear in lieu of it. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> to do him Ju&s;tice, did not attain to this unlucky Expre&s;&s;ion <HI>Proprio Marte.</HI> It &s;eems rather to be a Form of Words, <HI>venerable</HI> for <HI>Antiquity;</HI> their very <HI>Giants in Divinity</HI> &s;peak the &s;ame Things,
<PB N="4" REF="004705_0005_100DBD3E455518D8">and feed their People with the &s;ame <HI>whole&s;ome</HI> but not very <HI>nouri&s;hing Food.</HI></P>
<P>The good <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> goes on in continuation of the Sen|tence; Or <HI>that as the Body without the Soul is dead, &s;o Faith without Works, whither before</HI> or after Ju&s;tification, is dead al&s;o.</P>
<P>In which Words he makes no Declaration of his Idea of Faith in Man's <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> &s;ince he only &s;ets down a Scrip|ture Pa&s;&s;age, without explaining it; which he knows his Adver&s;aries maintain to be <HI>their</HI> Belief as well as he that 'tis <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>This is ju&s;t as if an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, that he firmly believed and had always taught his Hearers, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God;</HI> and without explaining him|&s;elf further, de&s;ire to be &s;et Right, if in this he hath a&s;&s;ered any Thing contrary to the Scriptures. Would not Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> him&s;elf think &s;uch an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian,</HI> had &s;aid <HI>nothing</HI> in all this, and therefore de&s;erved no Notice. And yet this is exactly his own Ca&s;e, in &s;aying that he be|lieves with St. <HI>James,</HI> that Faith <HI>without Works is dead,</HI> and de&s;iring to be re&s;tored, if he hath &s;aid ami&s;s. Upon the whole, I have often heard of &s;ome who have a Talent of &s;aying a great deal in a little: of others, who&s;e Talent is to &s;ay a little in a great deal; and with the&s;e I incline to rank Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> tho' &s;ome critical Readers, may be apt to thru&s;t him down to a third Cla&s;s, alledging that thro' this whole Epi&s;tle he hath &s;aid ju&s;t nothing at all:

<HEAD>Remarks upon Mr. GARDEN's <HI>Third</HI> LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Garden</HI>'s third Letter, is as he &s;aith, a Supplement to his former, and containing a few Queries to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> concerning his Behaviour as a Presbyter of the Church of England. And he immediately attacks him with a Charge of wilful and malicious Slander again&s;t his Brethren Conformi&s;ts, in the before mentioned <HI>Sermon</HI> pag. 18. <Q>You have accu&s;ed them in that Sermon,
<PB N="5" REF="004705_0005_100DBD3E455518D8">&s;aith Mr. GARDEN, <HI>of not Preaching the Truth as it is in Je&s;us, of falling from our E&s;tabli&s;hed Articles. and of Preaching only the Law, &amp; not the Way of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> i. e. <HI>of Preach|ing Ju&s;tification by Works, and not by Faith only.</HI></Q> And then instead of &s;aying in Words, (whatever he &s;aid in his Heart) <HI>Pudet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aec opprobria nobis, et dici potui&s;&s;e et non potui&s;&s;e refelli;</HI> he very couragiou&s;ly asks Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> where are his Evi|dences, what Proof he hath to &s;upport his Charge; and chal|lenges him to make out the A&s;&s;ertion; which alas! is a thing <HI>Deplorably ea&s;y</HI> to be done. Accordingly I &s;hall &s;et my &s;elf to &s;hew that the Clergy in general have run away from their own Articles, leaving them to the Di&s;&s;enters to keep for them: And more particularly that of <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith only,</HI> crying up <HI>dead Works</HI> in Lieu of it. That they have De&s;erted the Articles Solemnly Sub&s;cribed by them, will appear from the Proof of the&s;e two A&s;&s;ertions, <HI>viz</HI> (1) That their Articles were Indu&s;triou&s;ly compiled in oppo&s;ition to what are <HI>now</HI> called <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors; and (2) that their Clergy generally &s;peaking are Infected with this <HI>deadly Poy&s;on;</HI> and &s;pread the Infection with all their Might.</P>
<P>FIRST then I will attempt to make it evident that the Ar|ticles were Indu&s;triou&s;ly compo&s;ed, to confront what are called <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors. And this is &s;o plain, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that he that Runs may Read it in them. I doubt not but if a Million of unprejudiced Men, were to peru&s;e them, they would to a Man con&s;true them in this Sen&s;e. Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> therefore, a Man of chief Note among them, being both afraid &amp; a&s;ham'd of twi&s;ting them into the Sen&s;e of <HI>Arminius,</HI> acknowledges that they directly and expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Calvinian Doctrines,</HI> and therefore he advi&s;es the Convocation to alter them, or to lay them quite a&s;ide. (See Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton's</HI> Preface to Dr. <HI>Mather.</HI>)</P>
<P>I know the Men of this Way have this Subterfuge, viz. that the Compilers of the Articles intended a <HI>double Meaning</HI> that &s;o hone&s;t Men on both Sides the Que&s;tion might &s;ee their own Principles in them, and &s;ub&s;cribe them with a good Con&s;cience. But this is a broken Reed to lean upon. For in the fir&s;t Place, it doth not &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with Simplicity and godly Sincerity, that a Number of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, &s;hould avoid <HI>Plainne&s;s of Speech</HI> with their utmo&s;t En|deavours, and &s;tudy Words of <HI>an uncertain Sound,</HI> while they
<PB N="6" REF="004705_0006_100DBD4095BE8358">were declaring what they <HI>thought to be the Truth as it was in Je&s;us.</HI> And the very Gentlemen who u&s;e this Eva&s;ion, re|flect greatly upon them&s;elves, as well as upon the Authors of the Articles: For they do in Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that if they had been of the Number of the ancient Compilers, or were they now to compile Articles which contained the true Belief of the Church of England, they would ea&s;ily be carried <HI>away with &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> and <HI>&s;lily</HI> hunt after Words that have a double, and a treble Meaning too, if they could find them. Charity therefore for tho&s;e worthy Compilers of the Articles, and a Regard to their own Reputation, &s;hould keep the&s;e Men from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imating that they were &s;o <HI>full of Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty,</HI> and acted <HI>not uprightly, according to the Truth of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, (in the next Place) the <HI>Preamble to the Articles</HI> &s;aith, that they were compos'd with this View, that there might be <HI>Uniformity</HI> touching the Doctrine of true Religion: and if <HI>Uniformity</HI> and <HI>Diver&s;ity</HI> be not the &s;ame Thing, then it follows, that the Compilers had no double Meanings in the Articles. In a Word, the Compilers &s;ay, that they de&s;ign'd Men &s;hould be of <HI>one</HI> Mind; the&s;e Gentlemen &s;ay, they <HI>de&s;ign'd</HI> Men &s;hould be of <HI>two Minds;</HI> and who could tell their Intent be&s;t, <HI>they them&s;elves,</HI> or <HI>the&s;e Men,</HI> let the World judge. And as the Articles were compes'd upon the <HI>Calvin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tick Scheme,</HI> &s;o have they been publickly under&s;tood ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I am now, (which was the SECOND Thing) to &s;hew that the Clergy, generally &s;peaking, have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn'd their Backs upon their own Articles, and have embrac'd, and propagated the Errors of <HI>Arminius.</HI> I &s;ay, generally &s;peaking; becau&s;e, as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> ob&s;erves, there are &s;ome &s;ew who dare to ad|here to the Doctrines of the Reformation, and are not a&s;ha|med to preach what they have &s;ub&s;cribed, but <HI>Apparent Rari:</HI> and tho&s;e that do appear, have Trials of <HI>cruel Mockings,</HI> are treated <HI>as the filth and off-&s;courging of all Things;</HI> and as bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er Enemies to what is <HI>now</HI> called the Church. This is &s;o evident and a Thing they &s;o much G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory in, that I &s;hall not Summon any Arguments to prove <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> upon them, le&s;t I come under that Cen&s;ure of CICERO; <HI>Utitur in re non Dubia Te&s;&s;ibus non Nece&s;&s;ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is.</HI> Tho' it is probable that Mr.
<PB N="7" REF="004705_0006_100DBD4095BE8358"><HI>John&s;on</HI> may ri&s;e up, and di&s;approve of my taking this Point for granted. For in his &s;econd Letter to his <HI>di&s;&s;enting Pari&s;hioners</HI> (i.e. to tho&s;e Pari&s;hioners of his, that are not his Pari&s;hioners) he a&s;&s;erts it is very abu&s;ive to call him and his Brethren <HI>Arminians,</HI> &s;ince they don't hold every Thing ju&s;t as <HI>Arminius</HI> did. But at this Rate, he might deny that there is an <HI>Arian,</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> upon the Face of the Earth, &s;ince tho&s;e that are called <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> differ in &s;ome Things (full as much as they from <HI>Arminius</HI>) from their re&s;pective Founders, <HI>Arius</HI> and <HI>Socinus.</HI> However, if the Name of <HI>Arminians</HI> doth not exactly &s;uit them; they mu&s;t have &s;ome other Name invented for them, which &s;ig|nifies f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll as bad. Nay, as Multitudes of them are le&s;s Orthodox than <HI>Arminius,</HI> they had better be contented with the Name they have at pre&s;ent, for fear of a <HI>wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I now proceed to the <HI>particular Charge</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> brings again&s;t his Brethren of the E&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Clergy,</HI> viz. Their preaching up Ju&s;tification by Works, and not by Faith only, as they are enjoined by their own Article. And hath Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> the Forehead to deny this? Yes, &s;urely; and calls it a malicious Slander, without the lea&s;t Foundation of Truth to &s;upport it; and yet poor Man, while he would clear the Clergy from this Charge, he owns the very Thing charg'd again&s;t them; and is a <HI>&s;wift Witne&s;s again&s;t him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The Doctrine (&s;aith he) which you are &s;o angry at, and cen&s;ure as preaching Ju&s;tification by Works, and not by F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th only, is this; That we are ju&s;tified by Faith only, and not by Works; thus explained, viz. that we are ju&s;ti|fied by &s;uch a Faith as is true and lively, that is actually producing good Fruits or Works, and con&s;equently <HI>im|plying</HI> them, as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition, (but no meritorious Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e) of our Ju&s;tification. pag. 8, 9.</Q> That is, we are ju&s;tified by &s;uch a Faith as <HI>implies</HI> Works. <HI>Works</HI> are part of this Man's Definition of <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith;</HI> nay an e&s;&s;ential Part according to Bi&s;hop <HI>Williams,</HI> whom our Author cires, as giving his own Sentiments. For "the Faith which ju&s;tifies, (&s;aith the Bi&s;hop) 'is a <HI>practical Faith,</HI> and to which <HI>Repentance</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>Obedience</HI> (i.e. Works) do belong as <HI>the e&s;&s;ential</HI> Parts of it." Which is exactly the &s;ame that others mean when they tell
<PB N="8" REF="004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0">us, that Faith in Chri&s;t, &s;ignifies Faith in him, and Faith|fulne&s;s to him; an a&s;&s;ent to the Go&s;pel, and compliance with it. However, tho' Works are an e&s;&s;ential Part of ju&s;tifying Faith, yet if we will believe Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> they don't at all ju&s;tify. Egregiou&s;ly ab&s;urd! As if that which is the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Part</HI> of a Thing, &s;hould have no Hand in what is done <HI>by</HI> that Thing. Common Sen&s;e will tell any one, that if Faith doth ju&s;tify, whatever is Faith doth ju&s;tify; and &s;ince <HI>Works</HI> are Part of Faith, an e&s;&s;ential Part of it, <HI>Works</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o ju&s;tify in Part: And then what becomes of their <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith only,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, he and his Brethren maintain. His way to creep out is no better, nor bigger than this: by Faith he means Faith and Works too; and then very cunningly holds, that we are ju&s;tified by Faith only. Which is ju&s;t about as Good, as if a Man &s;hould &s;ay that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> only commanded in &s;uch a Battle, and that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was not with him: and being urged, that he a&s;&s;erted what was contrary to <HI>known Fact;</HI> &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon it, <HI>that it was a certain Truth that the Duke only commanded, and that the Prince was not with him;</HI> making out his A&s;&s;ertion thus; that by the <HI>Duke of Marlborough</HI> he always means, <HI>the Duke</HI> of <HI>Marlborough, and Prince Eugene too.</HI></P>
<P>But then if this is what Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> means, what need is there of fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, that we are ju&s;tified by <HI>Faith only.</HI> For if his Defi|nition of Faith be &s;o large as to take in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> too, what is there left to ju&s;tify: By &s;aying that we are ju&s;tified by Faith <HI>only,</HI> he &s;eems to exclude &s;omething el&s;e which er|roneous Men are apt to think doth ju&s;tify; and in reality, he takes in every thing, and excludes nothing at all. And the Amount of this &s;aying in his Mouth, and the Mouths of his Brethren, is only this; that Men are ju&s;tified <HI>only</HI> by every thing, and by nothing el&s;e. It were to be wi&s;hed therefore that they would be a little more Logical for the future, and only &s;ay, <HI>that men are ju&s;tified by Faith;</HI> leaving the needle&s;s Word <HI>only</HI> out of all their Writings and Di&s;|cour&s;es for ever.</P>
<P>The Truth is, Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends &s;ee &s;o much of Ju&s;ti|fication by <HI>Faith only</HI> in the Scriptures of Truth, e&s;pecially the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> that they are a&s;hamed of holding
<PB N="9" REF="004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0">any Thing el&s;e but Ju&s;tification by Faith only them&s;elves. But in as much as they don't <HI>believe it with the Heart;</HI> whenever they take it upon them to explain them&s;elves, they are always found out. They try to &s;ay <HI>Shibboleth,</HI> as well as others; but they can't frame their Mouths for &s;uch an hard Word; after all their Endeavours an unavoidable <HI>Sibboleth</HI> comes and di&s;covers who they are. Even the good Bi&s;hop of Lon|don him&s;elf is an In&s;tance, &s;hewing how impo&s;&s;ible it is that any one who&s;e Heart is not Right in the Article of <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith,</HI> &s;hould expre&s;s him&s;elf upon that Sub|ject, to the Satisfaction of tho&s;e who have a true Idea of it. For, when in his pa&s;toral Letter, he exhorts his Clergy, <Q>to preach Ju&s;tification by Faith only, &s;o as to leave no Doubt upon the Minds of their Hearers but that Good Works are a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Ju&s;tification:</HI></Q> 'Tis no better than if he had acco&s;ted them thus; My very good Presbyters, when|ever you teach your People that they are <HI>ju&s;tified by Faith only,</HI> never leave them till you have made them believe that they are not ju&s;tified by Faith only: which Injunction of his Lord|&s;hip they are too careful to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that whatever Stre&s;s the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> and all the <HI>Men of this Device</HI> lay upon Good Works, they don't look upon them as meritorious Cau&s;es of <HI>Man's Ju&s;tifi|cation,</HI> but that they allow that the Death and Sufferings of Chri&s;t, are what alone merit Ju&s;tification for the rebellious Sons of Men. I an&s;wer, whoever charges them with this? The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves own Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion to be the merito|rious Cau&s;e that Ju&s;tification may be had for us with God. But then doth it follow that becau&s;e they don't hold Merit in this <HI>high</HI> Sen&s;e, that therefore they don't hold it in any Sen&s;e? That becau&s;e they are not wor&s;e than the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in this Point, that therefore they are nothing like them?</P>
<P>But to come directly to our Charge again&s;t them; and it is this; That &s;ince Chri&s;t hath merited Ju&s;tification for Man|kind, they together with the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> hold that the way for them to <HI>merit,</HI> or to be intitled to this <HI>merited</HI> Ju&s;tification, are <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which they do</HI> The Reverend <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;urely will not deny this Charge; for he hath ex|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ly told the World, that, GOOD WORKS ARE MEANS OF OUR JUSTIFICATION.

I do not pretend to &s;ay that the&s;e Men have any De&s;ign of a total Reconciliation with that Church; or that they are as bad as Papi&s;ts: For Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI>'s &s;aying, is what I agree to; viz. <Q>That tho&s;e Prote&s;tants who hold Ju&s;tification by Works have only the <HI>Heart</HI> of Popery without the <HI>Head:</HI></Q> And 'tis certainly better to have only the <HI>Heart,</HI> than to have <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI> too.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> who charges Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> with Fai&s;hood and Slander, for &s;aying he and others held Ju&s;tification by Works, hath in Fact owned the very Thing by &s;aying <HI>Good Works are Means of Ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> I know, will be ready to &s;ay, as he hath &s;aid, that tho' <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>Means of Ju&s;tification,</HI> yet <HI>they don't ju&s;tify.</HI> Which is no better than it he &s;hould &s;ay, that Blows given with an <HI>Ax,</HI> were Means of cutting down a certain Tree; but yet the Tree was not cut down <HI>by tho&s;e Blows.</HI> For my Part I &s;hould think that Means which do nothing are very poor Means; or rather no <HI>Means at all.</HI></P>

And</P>
<P N="1">1. Will it not follow from hence that Good Works are <HI>the Only Means of Ju&s;tification?</HI> I am apt to think that if they do <HI>any Thing</HI> in Man's Ju&s;tification, they do <HI>every Thing;</HI> as may appear from the following In&s;tance. Sup|po&s;e two Men to have only <HI>that Faith without Works which is dead;</HI> they are at pre&s;ent undoubtedly in an unju&s;tified State.

And yet what is the Cau&s;e that the former is ju&s;tified while the latter is not? why nothing, but <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which he did.</HI> So that the <HI>whole</HI> of this Man's Ju&s;tification curtis upon his <HI>Good Works.</HI> If i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;aid, that this Man is not ju&s;tified <HI>by his Works,</HI> but becau&s;e his Faith was <HI>lively</HI> and operative (as I expect it will be &s;aid) I an&s;wer, this is &s;aying nothing; and I &s;hall
<PB N="13" REF="004705_0009_100DBD4662AA7B30">take Notice of it But if it be &s;aid that this happy Man, be&s;ides his <HI>Works,</HI> had an increa&s;ing <HI>Faith,</HI> more than he had when he fir&s;t &s;et out; and more than the other ever had; I An&s;wer, The good Man's Faith was of the &s;ame Kind with the wicked Man's, and only &s;uperiour in Degree (both being only Faith of A&s;&s;ent.) And if the bad Man's Faith did not ju&s;tify him at all; &s;o neither can a greater Degree of the &s;ame Faith be of a ju&s;tifying Nature; And con&s;equently he that <HI>was ju&s;tifyed,</HI> was ju&s;tified by <HI>Works,</HI> and not by <HI>Faith.</HI> Or, if any Man will &s;ay, that he was ju&s;tified <HI>by Faith,</HI> it can be only in <HI>this poor Sen&s;e,</HI> viz. he was ju&s;tified by Faith, only as Faith help'd him to do <HI>ju&s;tifying Works.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If good Works are Means of Ju&s;tification, then a cer|tain Number of Good Works is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify every Per&s;on that comes into the World. I &s;ay not that the &s;ame Number of good Works will do for all. For, to keep to their Principle, they mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that a greater or le&s;&s;er Number &s;hall be required, according as Per&s;ons have been greater or le&s;&s;er Sinners; and according as the good Works they do are <HI>more</HI> or <HI>le&s;s</HI> vertuous, not to &s;ay <HI>meritorious.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;equently no Man can tell exactly when he o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> others are ju&s;tified; contrary to the Scripture, which ex|horts Men to be &s;ure of their Ju&s;tification, and to rejoyce in a Sen&s;e of it; becau&s;e 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to know ju&s;t how many Works will do. There are &s;ome that hold that no Man is ju&s;tified <HI>in this Life:</HI> and that <HI>we mu&s;t needs go out of the World</HI> before it can be &s;aid of us, that God is at Peace with us. And I &s;hall &s;hew, that Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Works have led him into this Error by and by: If he &s;tands by one of his Bi&s;hops whom he hath cited as giving his own Sentiments.</P>
<P N="4">4. If Good Works are Means of Ju&s;tification, this is an undeniable Con&s;equence, that a Man may attain to <HI>one half, two thirds, three quarters, ninety nine hundredths</HI> of Ju&s;tification; may arrive &s;o near to it that one Prayer, or good Wi&s;h more would certainly ju&s;tify him; which Divinity St. <HI>Paul</HI> would never have own'd. The mo&s;t <HI>un&s;eeing</HI> of Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Friends may be &s;en&s;ible of no Con&s;equence <HI>here:</HI> And others may call it Cavilling and <HI>Sophi&s;try,</HI> that don't de&s;erve an An&s;|wer; and thereby keep up their Credit with their Hearers.

<P>I &s;ay again; that if Good Works are the <HI>Means of Ju&s;ti|fication,</HI> there will be a nece&s;&s;ity l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id upon the&s;e Men to ac|knowledge what I have now objected; and particularly that a Man may be &s;o near a ju&s;tified E&s;tate, that one little good Work more, would certainly bring him into it. This will hold good in all manner of Works which require a Conti|nuance of Time for their performance. Thus in the fini&s;h|ing an Hou&s;e, or writing a Book, there is a certain Time, wherein one Blow more with the Hand, or one Letter more with the Pen, would compleat the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Book</HI> And &s;o in Ju&s;tification which is tho't by them a Work of long Conti|nuance, and effected by good Works as the Means; there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be a critical In&s;tant, in which a Man may be &s;o near being ju&s;tified, that the doing the lea&s;t good Work that can be tho't of would ju&s;tify him intirely. Well then; this being in&s;eperable from Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s dear Doctrine of <HI>Good Works being the Means of Ju&s;tification,</HI> I would ask, (if it be lawful to ask a civil Que&s;tion) what would become of a poor Sinner, that &s;hould be taken out of the World in that unhappy <HI>Juncture,</HI> wherein his Ju&s;tifica|tion was &s;o near being effected, that there wanted but one good Wi&s;h, one, Lord have Mercy upon me, more, to have compleated it? Shall the Man be mi&s;erable for ever for this Defect? Or, &s;hall he be look'd upon as ju&s;tified, tho' he had not quite worked out his own Ju&s;tification? Or, la&s;tly, &s;hall he be doom'd to <HI>Purgatory</HI> for a while, to &s;atisfy for what was wanting, and thereby to be <HI>made meet for the In|heritance of the Saints in Light?</HI> As the Papi&s;ts po&s;itively hold, being induc'd by Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s Principle of <HI>Good Works being the Means of Ju&s;tification.</HI> La&s;tly, I would ask, what will become of tho&s;e <HI>Good Works,</HI> which are the <HI>Overplus</HI> after a Man is ju&s;tified? And whether it be not from this Doctrine that the Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts teach that &s;ome Men may have more good Deeds than they need them&s;elves, and a little to &s;pate for tho&s;e that want,</P>

If he had thought that Works did any thing in Man's Ju&s;tification, tho' never &s;o little, he would certainly have acknowledged it, notwith&s;tanding all his Zeal for Faith; and not have determined peremptorily that they did nothing at all.

Nay, St. <HI>Paul</HI> not only inculcates the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith without any <HI>impure Mixture</HI> of Works; but &s;hews it to be of the la&s;t Importance to be believed. He te&s;tifies to the <HI>Galatians</HI> over and over, and to all Chri&s;tians to the End of the World, that whoever &s;ought to be ju&s;ti|fied by the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> (as well moral as ceremonial Works) they <HI>had fallen from Grace, and Chri&s;t would profit them nothing,</HI> Gal. 5.4.</P>
<P>This was what St. <HI>Paul</HI> te&s;tified &s;eventeen Hundred Years ago And would to God that all his Succe&s;&s;ors, would te&s;tify the &s;ame Thing, and not directly the contrary!

<P>But to return; Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> having conceded that St. PAUL held Ju&s;tification <HI>by Faith,</HI> would have him expounded by St. JAMES, who &s;aith that <HI>Faith without Works is dead being alone</HI> And it is very true that St PAUL &s;hould be &s;o under&s;tood. But tho' St. PAUL held undoubtedly that Works were the effect of a Ju&s;tifying Faith, yet it never entered into his Heart, that Works had any Hand in <HI>ju&s;tifying;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Brethren Dream it hath. I cannot but ob&s;erve that as the Apo&s;tle PAUL and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> differ, &s;o there is no great Harmony between <HI>him</HI> and St. JAMES, even in this Pa&s;&s;age, which he hath cited from him, as co re&s;pondent to his own Thoughts For certainly St. JAMES by &s;aving that <HI>Faith without Works is Dead;</HI> &s;aith that Faith <HI>with Works is not Dead</HI> Whereas our Divine thinks, that <HI>Faith with Works</HI> may be Dead as well as <HI>Faith without Works.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> and Friends may Cry out <HI>Slander</HI> and <HI>Abu&s;e;</HI> but let them have a little Patience. For, in &s;peaking to the <HI>Twelfth Article</HI> of the Church, pag. 18. He &s;aith that the Article dont mean to exclude <HI>good Works going before Ju&s;tification provided that they are the fruits of Faith;</HI> &s;o that there may be good Works according to him, which are the <HI>fruits of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Man that hath this Faith and Works,</HI> not <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> and con|&s;equently

<P>But Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> will &s;ay, that the <HI>Homily</HI> means, that the <HI>Faith which is true and lively is full of Good Works &amp;c.</HI> and that therefore there is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peaks of an infu&s;ed <HI>Calvini&s;tick Faith,</HI> &s;imultaneous with Ju&s;tification, and incon&s;i&s;tent with Good Works going before it.

But I have one very &s;trong Rea&s;on to the contrary, and that is this; that I can hardly believe they were &s;hallow enough to have no better a Meaning We have already &s;een what <HI>his true</HI> and <HI>lively Faith</HI> is, viz. <HI>A Faith actually producing good Works.</HI> And therefore, if the Authors of the HOMILY <HI>intended Mr.</HI> Gar|den's <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue and lively Faith;</HI> the Amount of what they &s;aid in the forecited Words would be only this, viz. that the <HI>Faith</HI> which actually produceth Good Works, produceth Good Works; and when he hath <HI>a Faith</HI> that <HI>garni&s;heth him with Good Works,</HI> then <HI>he is garni&s;hed with Good Works.</HI> In a Word, the Authors of the <HI>Homily</HI> under&s;tood the <HI>Eleventh Article</HI> to &s;peak of <HI>&s;uch a Faith</HI> which is <HI>coexi&s;tent with Ju&s;tification;</HI> and between <HI>which</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> there can be <HI>no</HI> Good Works.</P>
<P>But for your full Conviction, I &s;hall &s;how from your Book of Homilies and Articles (1) What is that Faith which they hold does ju&s;tify; and (2) That this Faith only is <HI>That</HI> which ju&s;tifies.

<P>For be&s;ides what I recited before from the &s;aid <HI>Homily,</HI> affirming that WITHOUT WORKS <HI>by</HI> FAITH ONLY <HI>we are</HI> JUSTIFIED, and that THIS <HI>is the Doctrine of</HI> ALL <HI>the</HI> ANCIENT AUTHORS; &s;ince this authentick Book enlarges on this GreatPoint, I &s;hall add the following Pa&s;&s;ages from it, to your utter Contu&s;ion: In <HI>Part</HI> I of the &s;aid <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> are the following Pa&s;&s;ages, viz. <Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> declareth here <HI>nothing</HI> upon <HI>the Behalf of Man</HI> concerning his <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> but ONLY a true and lively <HI>Faith,</HI> which neverthele&s;s is the Gift of GOD, and not Man's only Work without GOD: and vet that FAITH doth not &s;hut out <HI>Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread</HI> and the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, to be join'd with FAITH in every Man that is ju&s;tified; but <HI>it &s;hutteth</HI> THEM <HI>out from

<P>And after the above recited Pa&s;&s;ages of the Doctrine of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in the &s;aid 2d <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Sermon</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> wherein the Homily teaches Ju&s;tification without Works by Faith only; the Homily condemns you and all your Clergy who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou &s;ay preach Good Works as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Ju&s;tification; I &s;ay, the &s;aid Homily fearfully condemns you in the following Words&mdash;in the Margin, "WHAT THEY BE <HI>that impugn the Doctrine that</HI> FAITH ONLY JUSTIFIETH." And again&s;t the &s;aid Margin in the Body of the Page, the Clau&s;es following, viz. <Q><HI>This Faith</HI> the holy Scripture teach|eth us is the &s;trong Rock and Foundation of Chri&s;tian Re|ligion: THIS DOCTRINE <HI>all old and ancient Authors</HI> of Chri&s;t's Church do approve: <HI>This Doctrine</HI> advanceth and &s;etteth forth the true Glory of CHRIST &amp; beateth down the vain Glory of Man: THIS who&s;oever denieth, <HI>is not to be accounted for a Chri&s;tian Man,</HI> nor for a &s;etter forth of CHRIST's Glory, but for <HI>an Adver&s;ary</HI> to CHRIST and <HI>his Go&s;pel,</HI> and for a &s;etter forth of Men's vain Glory.</Q></P>

<P>Yes what a <HI>horrid Scandal</HI> does Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> Charge on <HI>his own Clergy?</HI> For <HI>contrary</HI> to their own Book of <HI>Homilies,</HI> and to their own <HI>Articles</HI> a&s;&s;erting the Book of <HI>Homilies</HI> to contain <HI>a godly and whol&s;ome Doctrine</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e Times,</HI> and THEREFORE <HI>to be read in Churches by the Mini|&s;ter</HI> DILIGENTLY <HI>and di&s;tinctly, that they may be under&s;tanded of the People:</HI> And e&s;pecially <HI>contrary</HI> to the 11th <HI>Article,</HI> which a&s;&s;erts that <HI>we are ju&s;tified by</HI> FAITH ONLY <HI>is a</HI> MOST WHOLSOME <HI>Doctrine, as more largely expre&s;&s;ed in the Homily of Ju&s;tification;</HI> yea la&s;tly <HI>contrary</HI> to their own &s;olemn <HI>Declaration of their</HI> UNFEIGNED ASSENT <HI>and their Sub|&s;cription to the &s;ame</HI> &mdash; Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> affirms in <HI>Print</HI> that THEIR CLELGY <HI>teach</HI> GOOD WORKS <HI>as a</HI> NECESSARY CONDITION <HI>of</HI> JUSTIFICATION.</P>
<P N="4">IV.

<P>But both Bi&s;hop <HI>Barnet</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s next cited Author Bi&s;hop <HI>Williams,</HI> are &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>modern Writers</HI> whom all Men of Learning know have, in the Point of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> openly departed from the Doctrine of the <HI>fir&s;t Reformers</HI> in the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And to convince every one of this, he needs only read the Pa&s;&s;ages Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> cites from Bi&s;hop <HI>Barnet</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Williams</HI> and then compare them with the Pa&s;&s;ages I have recited from the <HI>Articks,</HI> the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Ho|milies,</HI> and Bp <HI>Downam.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4.

Ju&s;tifying Faith, &s;ignifies Faith and all manner of Good Works in Conjunction. And in the la&s;t Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, he tells us that not only <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> but <HI>Per&s;everance al&s;o</HI> belongs to this ju&s;tifying Faith, and is an e&s;&s;ential Part of it. See Pag 11. lin. ult From which Words of the <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> and Mr <HI>Garden</HI>'s citing them with Approbation, may we not di&s;cover a very odd Opinion held by them both. viz. That no Man is, ju&s;tified in this Life; and that we mu&s;t needs go out of the World before it can be &s;aid that we are
<PB N="29" REF="004705_0017_100DBD5A287F3BB8">reconciled to our Maker? contrary to the Tenor of the Bible. For if <HI>Per&s;everance</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential Part of <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith,</HI> there can be no &s;uch Thing as Ju&s;tification, while an e&s;&s;ential Part of that which ju&s;tifies is wanting; and this e&s;&s;ential Part mu&s;t be wanting all the Days of a Man's Life: for <HI>Per&s;everance</HI> intends the whole of our Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But however horrid this Opinion appears, con&s;idered in it's Repugnancy to Scripture, and Rea&s;on, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it looks much better if we take a View of it as grafted upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Bo&s;om <HI>Tenet,</HI> that Good Works are Means of Ju&s;tifi|cation. Nay, if I could once &s;wallow down the latter, I &s;hould make no difficulty with the former If I really tho't Good Words to be Means of Ju&s;tification. I &s;hould think it more likely that a Man &s;hould be ju&s;tified by the Good Works he performed thro' his whole Life; than by the <HI>Obedience</HI> of (perhaps) a few Days Nay it looks much more mode&s;t, and a&s;cribes a le&s;s degree of Merit to Good Works, to maintain that all the Good Works a Man ever did are required to ju&s;tify him, than to maintain, that half or one quarter of them (perhaps) will do very well.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, by this Means I &s;hould get rid of what I &s;hould be glad to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d of by any Means, <HI>viz.</HI> the Doctrine of a Man's being in a <HI>State of Grace</HI> to Day, <HI>and out of it</HI> To|morrow; his being a <HI>Child of</HI> GOD, and <HI>a Child of the Devil</HI> by <HI>turns,</HI> no one knows how often. And as to the Doctrine of a Man's attaining to <HI>one half two thirds, nine tenthts,</HI> &amp;c of Ju&s;|tification; I &s;hould be no more perplex'd with it upon the <HI>new Hypothe&s;is,</HI> than upon the <HI>old</HI> Thus I have fairly &s;hewn the Doctrine of <HI>no forgivene&s;s in this Life,</HI> may be charg'd upon the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and Mr <HI>Garden,</HI> &s;ince the Pa&s;&s;age which <HI>the former wrote,</HI> and which the latter vouches as his own Sentiments, un|deniably contains it.

Doth it follow that becau&s;e they <HI>might</HI> have another <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> that therefore they had? <HI>A Po&s;&s;e ad e&s;&s;e an unquam va|luit con&s;equentia?</HI></P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, that &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible, according to Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> that Men may hold Good Works to be Con|ditions of Ju&s;tification in another Sen&s;e than that of their being <HI>meritorious Cau&s;es,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> ought in Charity to think they did.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Charity mu&s;t have been extra|vagantly large, to have &s;uppos'd that they don't look upon Good Works as <HI>meritorious,</HI> when by Preaching, Writing, and Conver&s;ation, they declare they <HI>do.</HI> I don't &s;ay that they look upon Good Works to be meritorious of <HI>Condignity,</HI> but of <HI>Congruity only,</HI> with the more <HI>moderate Papi&s;ts.</HI> Indeed the Word <HI>Merit,</HI> is a <HI>Name</HI> of &s;uch evil Report, that they are perfectly a&s;hamed of it; but then they hold <HI>fa&s;t</HI> the <HI>Thing,</HI> which is wor&s;e than the <HI>Name;</HI> and will never be per&s;wa|ded to let it go. Nay, they have &s;ome of them the Cou|rage, to tax the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> as if this Doctrine was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culiar to them; and yet they cannot bring one Argument to &s;upport the Charge again&s;t the more moderate Papi&s;ts, which will not equally conclude again&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="004705_0019_100DBD5F2E7FD6D0">
This I have prov'd already, and need not do it again.</P>
<P>To return therefore; Mu&s;t Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> be deem'd a malicious Slanderer of the&s;e Men in what he hath &s;aid of them? No verily. Unle&s;s, they may be thought Slande|rers of their own Selves. For when they <HI>&s;peak</HI> or <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite,</HI> they make out full as much again&s;t them&s;elves, as he ever charg'd them with. Their very Charges of Fal&s;hood again&s;t him, unluckily for them, prove <HI>that he is a Man of Truth,</HI> and <HI>that in his Spirit there is no Guile.</HI> And the grand Rea&s;on why they <HI>count him</HI> their <HI>Enemy</HI> is <HI>becau&s;e he tells them the Truth;</HI> having found our, and born Te&s;timony again&s;t that ba&s;e &s;mugling Trade of Importing prohibited Goods from <HI>Rome,</HI> in which they are &s;o deeply engaged.</P>
<P>His 2d Argument (for 'tis very probable, <HI>he</HI> tho't it an Argument) is taken from what he &s;aith no one will deny, viz. That <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Good Works</HI> are both <HI>Conditions</HI> of Salva|tion; and if of Salvation, then he inters they mu&s;t be Con|ditions of Ju&s;tification too; and con&s;equently that Good Works go before Ju&s;tification. <HI>Q. E D.</HI></P>
<P>But then, I would tell him, that when he builds an Argu|ment upon the <HI>Con&s;ent of all,</HI> he mu&s;t be &s;ore that all <HI>do Con&s;ent;</HI> otherwi&s;e he will have no Foundation, and the Su|per&s;tructure, will be ju&s;t good for nothing. And accordingly I now take away this Foundation, and &s;et <HI>all a tumbling,</HI> by denying that Good Works, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Salvation,</HI> that there can in <HI>no Ca&s;e</HI> be <HI>Salvation</HI> without them. In which Denial I &s;hall be born out by all that hate the Ora|cles of <HI>Arminius;</HI> by the Church of England; and parti|cularly by Mr <HI>Garden</HI> him&s;elf: for this Gentleman &s;eems (by his Conduct) &s;o &s;et upon being con&s;uted, that lea&s;t his Ad|ver&s;ary &s;hould not do it effectually without him, he &s;carcely ever falls to confute him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Followers of Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> it is well known hold that as &s;oon as a Man believes he is ju&s;tified, and that if God &s;hould plea&s;e to take him out of the World in that In&s;tant, <HI>he would not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Live:</HI> tho' not <HI>one</HI> Good Work had been done by him. The Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ines of this Way do indeed more than any Men, pre&s;s the Nece&s;&s;ity of an univer&s;al Obedience to the Laws of God, te&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying unwea|riedly, that <HI>Faith without Works is dead;</HI> that is, that what|ever
<PB N="33" REF="004705_0019_100DBD5F2E7FD6D0">Pretences Men may have to Faith, yet if they dare to rebel again&s;t the mo&s;t high God, their Faith will not &s;top them from the Damnation of Hell whither they are ha&s;tning.

The Church of England al&s;o, being Calvini&s;tical, as I have &s;hewn; might from <HI>hence</HI> be argued to be of this Opinion: but they expre&s;ly &s;hew them&s;elves to be <HI>like minded,</HI> in their ordering <HI>the Mini&s;ter,</HI> in his <HI>Vi&s;itation of the Sick,</HI> after &s;aying to, and hearing a few Words from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he dying Per&s;on to forgive his Sins <HI>upon the Spot.</HI> Many Things might be excepted again&s;t <HI>this Form;</HI> but yet it &s;ully implies their Be|lief of this Truth, viz that a Man may be <HI>forgiven</HI> and in a State of <HI>Salvation</HI> without doing any <HI>Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all.</HI> Nay, Mr <HI>Garden</HI> (for I am now come to <HI>him</HI>) hath undoubt|edly affirmed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to departing <HI>Pro|fligates</HI> that by Vertue of the Power deriv'd to him from his Saviour, <HI>be forgave their Sins.</HI> Which (at the lea&s;t) im|plie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that if they were &s;incere in what they &s;aid to Mr. <HI>Gar|den,</HI> their Sins <HI>were forgiven by God.</HI> And if &s;o, then there is no doubt, but that if they had been &s;natched away the very Moment of their <HI>Ab&s;olution,</HI> Heaven &amp; Happine&s;s would have been their Portion.

<P>Perhaps, &s;ome Friend of Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> will be ready to &s;ay, that when he forgives the Sins of dying wicked Men, upon their &s;aying what is pre&s;crib'd for them to &s;ay in the <HI>Common Prayer Book, he</HI> hath Regard to &s;ome Good Works he &s;uppo&s;es they have &s;ormerly done; or rather to all the Good Works which the poor &s;ick wicked Men ever did in the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e of their Lives. So that tho' they are really <HI>forgiven</HI> upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s ab&s;olving them, yet they are not forgiven
<PB N="34" REF="004705_0020_100DBD6282D24E28"><HI>without Good Works,</HI> that is Good Works <HI>formerly</HI> done by them. Without &s;topping to put &s;everal Que&s;tions which natural|ly ari&s;e here; I will evade this Solution, by &s;uppo&s;ing the dying Penitent to be one, who had formerly been <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> but had at the Time the Mini&s;ter comes to ab&s;olve <HI>him,</HI> fallen from <HI>Grace;</HI> nor done one Good Work towards rein&s;tating him&s;elf into the divine Favour: I would now <HI>ask,</HI> whither, upon his &s;aying in &s;incerity what is <HI>pre&s;cribed,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s <HI>forgiving him,</HI> he would <HI>really be forgiven by Gad.</HI> and taken to Happine&s;s, if he dy'd that In&s;tant?

<P>But perhaps it may be &s;aid, that tho' in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, there is no Regard to Good Works <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> yet there is to Good Works which the Per&s;on <HI>would have done,</HI> had he had a longer &s;pace: That <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Sinner, &s;o <HI>dying</HI> is forgiven and received up to Glory, becau&s;e God &s;aw the Validity of his Repentance, and that if there had been Opportunity, he would have brought forth Fruits meet for Repentance This is that <HI>vertual Obe|dience which Dr.</HI> TILLDTSON, &s;peaks of, in his Sermon, from the&s;e Words, <HI>If ye live after the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, ye &s;hall die &amp;c.</HI> And which he thinks will &s;ave a Man. where there is no room for that which is <HI>actual.

<P>For my Part, tho' I doubt not but that there have been and &s;till are <HI>many good Chri&s;tians</HI> of the <HI>Prelatical Church;</HI> yet at the &s;ame time I believe it to be matter of common and &s;orrowful <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> that the very highe&s;t part of High Church are generally &s;peaking, much wor&s;e than <HI>Scribes and Phari&s;ees:</HI> and vet the Men who officiate at their Funerals, and te&s;tify to their <HI>good E&s;tate;</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon it, that unle&s;s a Man's Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, his <HI>outward Acts of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and Obedience exceed tho&s;e of the <HI>Scribes and Phari&s;ees,</HI> he can in no Ca&s;e <HI>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>

Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <Q>that no one can be under any Temp|tation of disbelieving that Men are ju&s;tified immediately upon their believing: and gives this very odd Rea&s;on for it, viz. Becau&s;e the le&s;s we are required to do, &s;o much the happier is it for us, who are able to do &s;o little, and who are &s;o unwilling to do any thing at all.</Q> Pag. 20</P>
<P>That is in other Words, Since Salvation is ea&s;ier upon the Suppo&s;ition that Men are ju&s;tified by Faith, before the doing of Good Works, than upon Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s Suppo&s;ition, that Works are nece&s;&s;ary before Ju&s;tification; therefore any one would be rather tempted to believe the former to be right, than the latter, provided there were Grounds for it in Scripture. And I grant that were <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith</HI> a Thing &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly cheap as the <HI>Faith of A&s;&s;ent</HI> is, he would be <HI>right;</HI> it would be an ea&s;ier way to Heaven than <HI>his,</HI> and Men would NATURALLY hold <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> by <HI>Faith.</HI> But &s;ince <HI>ju&s;tifying Faith</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Principle infu&s;ed</HI> into the Soul by the SPIRIT OF GOD, which Man can't attain to of him&s;elf, and which therefore is infinitely harder than doing <HI>dead Works,</HI> before Ju&s;tification; 'tis the Difficulty of Salvation this way which makes Men <HI>naturally</HI> reject it, <HI>tho' a Man declare it unto them,</HI> and chu&s;e Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s way be|fore it.</P>
<P>For they &s;ay thus within them&s;elves; if this <HI>infu&s;ed Faith</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary, as we know nothing of it at pre&s;ent, to it being out of our Power, it may be we never &s;hall: And hence they will hold to <HI>that Way</HI> which &s;eems <HI>mo&s;t in their Power,</HI> and in &s;pight of Scripture &s;eek to be <HI>ju&s;tifyed</HI> by the <HI>Works of the Law;</HI> tho' God him&s;elf by In&s;piration a&s;&s;ures us that <HI>by the Deeds of the Law no Fle&s;h living &s;hall be ju&s;tified,</HI> Rom, 3.20.</P>
<P>Nay, I would appeal to the Con&s;ciences of Mr <HI>Garden</HI> and Abettors, whether or no the grand Cau&s;e of <HI>their</HI> Malignity again&s;t Ju&s;tification by an <HI>infu&s;ed Faith,</HI> be not a Fear that they are unacquainted with <HI>the Thing;</HI> and con&s;equently an Apprehen&s;ion that if the <HI>Doctrine</HI> be <HI>true,</HI> they them&s;elves are in a State of Damnation as yet, and without &s;o much Power to work out their own Salvation, as they chu&s;e to think them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Had they comfortable Hopes that let this Doctrine be ever &s;o true, they &s;hould run no Ri&s;que of <HI>Eternal Salvation;</HI> would they oppo&s;e the Doctrine with &s;o much Vigour and Rage? I am &s;ure they would not. Va&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="004705_0024_100DBD6AB48A9B78">Allowances ought therefore to be made by their Hearers and Readers, when they find them &s;et for the Defence of the contrary way of Ju&s;tification: For it is for their Intere&s;t; <HI>by this Craft they have their Comfort:</HI> If the other Way be right, they are undone for ever: And therefore it &s;tands them in Hand, to be zealous again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But with the <HI>Oppo&s;ers</HI> of <HI>their Doctrine</HI> it is not &s;o. Let it be never &s;o <HI>Right</HI> they are not hurt by it. If <HI>this Faith</HI> &s;hould be a Whim&s;ey (as <HI>they</HI> think and call it) yet they hold and practice <HI>Good Works,</HI> at lea&s;t as much as their Bre|thren; and therefore if the <HI>Arminian Ju&s;tification</HI> be the right one, they &s;hall be ju&s;tified with an <HI>Arminian</HI> Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>It would therefore be highly proper for <HI>Laymen,</HI> when they hear <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> on both Sides zealou&s;ly cry down each others Method of Ju&s;tification, to inquire with the wi&s;e Romans, <HI>Cui bono?</HI> i. e.

Would it not be their Wisdom therefore to conclude that there is <HI>&s;ome other thing</HI> which is <HI>truly</HI> JUSTIFYING FAITH, and to &s;eek after it? They have the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of <HI>thou&s;ands,</HI> and <HI>thou&s;ands,</HI> whom they mu&s;t own to be as wi&s;e and as good Men as them&s;elves, <HI>who have obtained this Mercy of the Lord:</HI> and who will tell them that they build all their Hopes upon it, counting <HI>Faith

<P>Nay, there are many who can a&s;&s;ure them that they them|&s;elves in the <HI>Times of their Ignorance,</HI> were <HI>Scoffers</HI> and <HI>Mockers</HI> at the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> being elated with <HI>un&s;anctified Rea|&s;on,</HI> and the Pride of <HI>Philo&s;ophy fal&s;ly &s;o called:</HI> And that they have had their towering Thoughts and <HI>lofty Imaginations</HI> brought down to the <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s of an infu&s;ed Faith;</HI> and that they would not be deprived of it for Millions of Worlds. Why therefore, &s;hould the&s;e Men reject it upon the <HI>Foun|dation</HI> of <HI>their own Want of Experience:</HI> for <HI>other Foundation can no Man have again&s;t it?</HI> Would not they them&s;elves call that <HI>Debauchee</HI> a <HI>Madman,</HI> who &s;hould affirm there was no <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> in a <HI>religious Life,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>never found</HI> any in it?

<P>Surely if they would be prevail'd upon to <HI>act as Men,</HI> and <HI>as Chri&s;tians;</HI> they would <HI>be jealous over them&s;elves with a godly Jealou&s;y,</HI> and <HI>cry mightily to GOD, that what they know not be would teach them:</HI> giving them&s;elves no re&s;t till the &s;ame Spirit which <HI>worketh</HI> in others, work <HI>effectually in them al&s;o,</HI> making them <HI>Partakers of like precious Faith:</HI> Which GOD of his infinite Mercy grant unto all that are de&s;titute of it; through JESUS CHRIST our <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Which brings me to the</P>

<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of them; viz his having <HI>no Talent at proving any Thing,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> &s;aith of him <HI>in his ha&s;te;</HI> were this true, he might neverthele&s;s, make out his <HI>A&s;&s;ertion.</HI> For there requires <HI>no Genius for Di&s;puting,</HI> to prove &s;o plain a Matter, as that of the indicted Clergy, holding <HI>Good Works to be meritorious; or that Men are ju&s;tified by them.</HI> He needed only to have collected what they them&s;elves have &s;aid, and then the unprejudiced Part of Mankind would have &s;een that <HI>they were condemned out of their own Mouths.</HI></P>
<P>And then, as to Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s being &s;cared from &s;uch an Attempt, by an Apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Solifidians</HI> being upon his back, and mauling him with the &s;ame Weapons, which he mu&s;t u&s;e in mauling his Clerical Brethren: I an&s;wer, this would <HI>have been fearing where no fear was.</HI></P>
<P>For it will by no Means 'follow that if Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> is a <HI>Meritmonger</HI> for &s;aving. <HI>Good Works nece&s;&s;arily go before Ju&s;tification;</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> mu&s;t be one too, for a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t|ing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Works are nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation:</HI> For Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Concerning the Rev. Mr. GARDEN'S Treatment of his Chri&s;tian Brother the Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of this Appendix is that vain glorious Paragraph in Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary's Third Letter, dated at Charle&s;town <HI>April</HI> 8. 1740, in the following Words&mdash;<Q>But &s;till PERSECUTION&mdash;you cry out; &mdash; <HI>for</HI> WANT <HI>of it</HI> you mean: For OURS <HI>is</HI> NO <HI>Per&s;ecuting Country for Religion;</HI> EVERY MAN <HI>may enjoy</HI> HIS OWN WAY <HI>in</HI> PEACE <HI>and</HI> SAFETY. But as you may regard the being <HI>Per&s;ecuted</HI> as &s;omething e&s;&s;ential to a true Chri&s;tian, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep up the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, you &s;eem to be <HI>in Que&s;t and Pur&s;uit</HI> of it; <HI>Plea&s;e only to &s;tep into a Neighbour|ing Country,</HI> SPAIN <HI>or</HI> PORTUGAL, <HI>and you'l hid fair, I dare &s;ay, to find it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now we'l &s;ee <HI>how long</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden</HI> will keep his Rev. and Chri&s;tian Brother <HI>Whitefield</HI> in WANT of <HI>Per&s;e|cution;</HI> and how long the Bi&s;hop's <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> will maintain the King's Province of <HI>South Carolina,</HI> to be <HI>no Per&s;ecuting Country</HI> for Religion; how long <HI>every Man</HI> may enjoy <HI>his own way</HI> there in <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Safety;</HI> and how long his pious and excellent Brother Clergyman Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had need of &s;tepping into <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> to <HI>find</HI> out <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI> For</P>

<P>To make this evident, I &s;hall here &s;et down &s;ome of Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary's bitter Words and Scoffings in his <HI>Third &amp; Fifth</HI> Letters, as follow &mdash; LETTER III. Dated <HI>April</HI> 8.</P>
<P>In Page 8. Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> charges Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> with 'wilful and malicious Slander'. Pag 9. 'Your Reve|rence'. &mdash; Apparent Shuffle'. Pag. 12. 'Your Reve|rence'. &mdash; Not without Shuffle &mdash; Thus your Reverence'. Pag. 13. 'Arrogant and wicked Slander in you&mdash; Mi&s;erable Di&s;tinction, a poor Jingle of Words &mdash; A Wrang|ler in your own Way'. Pag 14 'Your Mob Harangues&mdash; Guilty of wilful Slander'. &mdash; Non&s;en&s;e'.</P>
<P>In Page 16, 17, 18 are Mr. <HI>Garden</HI>'s following Flouts on the late Rev. Learned, Pious and highly e&s;teemed Dr <HI>Edwards,</HI> one of the principal Ornaments of the Church of England in his Day, and doubtle&s;s now in Glory. &mdash; Page 16. 'Sen&s;e|le&s;s Di&s;tinction'.&mdash;'Silly Subterfuges'.&mdash;'Rare Champion of Grace!'&mdash;'Wonderful Fears!' Pag. 17. 'A very &s;orry Deci&s;ion'.&mdash;'His Apprehen&s;ion of the Matter is ab&s;urd'. Pag. 18. 'Sanctified Logick out of all Que&s;tion!' &mdash; 'Arrant Piece of Non&s;en&s;e'.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ary</HI> returns to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> with the following reviling and jeering Pa&s;&s;ages, Pag. 20.

Are you not really Per&s;ecuted? Are you not ca&s;t out of the Synagogues; excluded the Church of England Pulpits; and treated as a Di&s;ciple of Fox or MUGGLETON? And is not all this PERSECUTION? But for what Cau&s;e ARE YOU THUS TREATED? Why only for the trifling Cau&s;e of accu&s;ing the Clergy &amp;c.</Q>&mdash; 'Will your Reverence be plea&s;ed &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI>'s IVth LETTER, dated <HI>April</HI> 15. is about an <HI>Anonymous Pamphlet,</HI> which he &s;ays <HI>He pre&s;umes not to know whether Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>approves of all and every Thing it con|tains.</HI> But in his Vth Letter, dated <HI>April</HI> 21. Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> readily returns to the &s;ame kind of abu&s;ive Language, in the following Pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<P>Pag. 32. <Q>Had you ob&s;erved common Decency or good Manners &mdash; But your contrary Behaviour, expo&s;es you to the utmo&s;t Scorn &amp; Contempt.</Q>&mdash;<Q>You know how, pretend|ing the Cau&s;e of God, to bring railing Accu&s;ations, to &s;up|port &s;ome Crotchets you have got in your own Brains.</Q> Pag. 33. <Q>You know how to di&s;pen&s;e it to the Populace in a Vehicle of cant Terms, without Sen&s;e or Meaning.</Q> Pag. 35. 'Arrant Gibberi&s;h!' Pag. 36. 'Your mon&s;trous Inference'. &mdash;'You love dearly to &s;huffl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e among Terms'.&mdash;<Q>Alas my old Friend, whether is your poor Head now a wandering?</Q>&mdash; <Q>In your Mountebank Way, you have young <HI>David</HI> like, as you fancy, &s;lain your <HI>Geliah.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>In the Pride and Naugh|tine&s;s of your Heart, you have made &s;o ab&s;urd an Attempt and &s;o fooli&s;hly manag'd it.</Q> &mdash; 'Your dirty Pamphlets'. Pag. 36, 37. <Q>But might not one &s;uch Conque&s;t have &s;ufficed you, as it did young <HI>David,</HI> at a Time? No, your noble Spirit &s;corns only to imitate, but mu&s;t excel. No &s;ooner have you di&s;patch'd this Champion of the un|circumci&s;ed in Heart and Ears; but advancing from a <HI>David</HI> into a Knight of <HI>Lamanca,</HI> you go &s;traight in Pur|&s;uit of new Adventures! And who unhappily falls in your Way, but another Son of <HI>Anak,</HI> the Author of the Whole Duty of Man? Down he mu&s;t come; &mdash; and thus you gird your &s;elf for the Battle.</Q> Pag. 37. <Q>Choice Ar|mour indeed! who &s;hall be able to &s;tand before you?

Page 39. 'Your Infallibility'. &mdash; 'Enlighren'd with your Reve|rence'. Pag 40. <Q>Have you not been dabling with the <HI>Marrow of modern Divinity,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch precious Book, which puz|zles your Head, and lies crude on your Under&s;tanding? Or are you deputed by &s;ome other Head or Hand behind the Curtain, to put off &s;uch Stuff upon the World? Or finally, do you really mean to burle&s;que the Bible &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I might recite other Pa&s;&s;ages; but am weary of them, and &s;o I believe is the Chri&s;tian Reader. But on the whole, I would ask, whether this is the Language of a grave, meek and humble <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ciple of</HI> JESUS; or of a <HI>Bi&s;hop's Commi&s;&s;ary?</HI> Exalted with a &s;ecular Dignity over, and look|ing down with Scorn upon his pious and labourious Brother; and a Brother flaming with a wondrous Zeal, and &s;pending his Strength more than all other Men in the&s;e Parts of the World, for the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of Souls, and <HI>Recovery</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>Pure Doctrines of Grace and Ju&s;tifi|cation;</HI> for which her <HI>fir&s;t Reformers</HI> gloriou&s;ly &s;uffered Mar|tyrdom; but which Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> now <HI>Derides,</HI> and &s;ays the <HI>pre&s;ent Clergy</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> are of the &s;ame Opi|nion with him: tho' both He and They have all &s;olemnly declared <HI>their unfeigned A&s;&s;ent</HI> to the contrary.</P>
<P>And as when <HI>there was a Strife among</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which of them &s;hould be accounted the Greate&s;t</HI> &mdash; JESUS <HI>called them to him and &s;aid, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e</HI> DOMINION <HI>over them; and they that are Great exerci&s;e</HI> AUTHORITY <HI>upon them; but</HI> IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU, Luk. xxii. and Math. xx. So Mini|&s;ters of a worldly Spirit, have in all Ages affected worldly <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority;</HI> like even tho&s;e fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, for which he ju&s;tly blamed them; and like the Princes
<PB N="53" REF="004705_0029_100DBD780E34DF10">and other great Ones among the Gentiles, which he forbids them in the lea&s;t to imitate lin the Exerci&s;e of <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority.</HI> A mo&s;t wi&s;e and gracious Prohibition! As all Ages re&s;ti&s;y; who have always found that the rai&s;ing the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to worldly <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> has rais'd their Pride, and made them Worldly, nouri&s;hed their &s;piteful Pa&s;&s;ions, ruined their humble Character; and given them a dreadful Scope to wreak their Malice and Revenge on tho&s;e beneath them. And <HI>none in the World have &s;o cruelly u&s;ed their Power as Clergymen inve&s;ted with a worldly Dominion and Authority.</HI></P>
<P>The BRITISH COLONIES have indeed <HI>till now</HI> been hap|pily free from their terrible <HI>Dominion.</HI> But whoever con&s;iders the <HI>Spirit</HI> which Mr <HI>Garden</HI> &s;hows in <HI>the above Expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> will be apt to think that he only wanted a <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Opportunity</HI> to vex his Rev and Pious <HI>Brother</HI> in a more grievous Manner. And it is not long ere the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> finds an <HI>Opportunity,</HI> and readily lays hold on it, to make Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> know and feel his <HI>Power.</HI> As we in the</P>
<P N="2">II. Place proceed to &s;how. For in the latter End of <HI>June</HI> following Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> goes from the Province of <HI>Georgia</HI> into the Province of <HI>South Carolina.</HI> On Thur&s;day <HI>July</HI> 3. enters <HI>Charle&s;town.</HI> The next Day being Friday <HI>July</HI> 4, receives a Letter from the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> immediately an&s;wers. On Saturday <HI>July</HI> 5, Preaches twice: and Lord's Day <HI>July</HI> 6 twice more. On the &s;ame Day he goes to <HI>Church</HI> both Forenoon and Afternoon: and as Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> writes in the following Words&mdash;<Q>I heard the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> Preach as <HI>virulent</HI> and <HI>unorthodox, incon&s;i&s;tent Di&s;|cour&s;e,</HI> as ever I heard in my Life. His Heart &s;eemed full of Choler and Re&s;entment: Out of the Abundance thereof, he poured forth &s;o many bitter Words again&s;t the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> (as he called them) in general, and <HI>Me</HI> in particular, that &s;everal who intended to receive the Sacrament at his Hands, withdrew. Never I believe was &s;uch a Preparation Sermon preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the &s;ame Spirit with Bi&s;hop <HI>Gardner</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Days. After Sermon he &s;ent his Clerk to de&s;ire me not to come to the Sacrament, till he had &s;poke with me &mdash; I immediately retired to my Lodging, rejoycing that I was
<PB N="54" REF="004705_0030_100DBD7BED060BF8">accounted worthy to &s;uffer this further Degree of Contempt for my dear Lord's Sake. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us lay it not to the Com|mi&s;&s;ary's Charge.</HI> Amen and Amen.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this I appeal to every impartial Reader, whether Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> had not by this preceeding Management utterly <HI>di&s;qualified</HI> Him&s;elf from being look'd upon as an <HI>impartial Judge</HI> over a Brother Clergyman, whom he had &s;o openly and opprobriou&s;ly Reviled?</P>
<P>But the more the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> rails, the more his People grow offended, and the more they leave him, and grow more cager of hearing another &s;ort of Preaching and another &s;ort of Language in the meek and humble Per&s;on reviled. And Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> being denied the Priviledge of Preaching in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> tho' de&s;ired by great Numbers of that So|ciety: where, when ever he officiates, he always u&s;es the <HI>Common Prayer Book</HI> and conforms thereto; as he accounts him&s;elf obliged, when in the <HI>Epi&s;copal Churches:</HI> At the De&s;ire of the People, he Pray'd and Preach'd in the <HI>Presby|terian Meeting Hou&s;e:</HI> and accounting him&s;elf not obliged by Law to u&s;e the Common Prayer Book in them, <HI>be Pray'd without it.</HI> Upon which the very next Day, viz <HI>Monday July</HI> 7. Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> could bear no longer, but begins the Exerci&s;e of his COMMISSARIAL <HI>Dominion</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> in the follow|ing <HI>Writ</HI> or <HI>Order.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> July 16. At 10 in the Morning, Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> appeared; and by the Advice of his Friends, exhibited a <HI>Recu&s;atio Judicis,</HI> that is, <HI>his Exception again&s;t the</HI> COMMISSA|RY'S <HI>being his</HI> Judge <HI>in this Cau&s;e; having too great Rea&s;on to believe the Commi&s;&s;ary prejudic'd again&s;t him.</HI> At fir&s;t the <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ary</HI> refu&s;ed to Read it.

<P><PB N="58" REF="004705_0032_100DBD81DEB04ED8">
Next Day, viz. <HI>Thur&s;day July</HI> 17, He return'd, and by his Attorney's Advice appear'd in Court again, to &s;ee if <HI>his Excep|tions</HI> were <HI>admitted to Arbitration,</HI> according to Law, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Repelled.</HI> And finding <HI>his Exceptions</HI> REPELLED, and his Attorney &s;top|ped, as he was ri&s;ing up to invalidate what the other Attorney &s;aid; Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> APPEALED <HI>to</HI> HIS MAJESTY <HI>in the High Court of Chancery,</HI> and <HI>declared all other Proceedings in that Court again&s;t him to be null and void.</HI> Which cau&s;ed many to re|joyce and give Thanks to God on his Behalf.</P>
<P><HI>Friday July</HI> 18, and <HI>Saturday July</HI> 19, He Preached twice each Day again at <HI>Charle&s;town.</HI> And <HI>Saturday</HI> after the After|noon Exerci&s;e, being de&s;ired by the <HI>Apparitor</HI> to go to the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary;</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> went: and at his De&s;ire to <HI>&s;ware</HI> he wou'd <HI>lodge his Appeal</HI> within a <HI>Twelve Month,</HI> and to De|po&s;ite <HI>Ten Pounds Sterling,</HI> and finding the Commi&s;&s;ary's Orders gave him Authority to require it; Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> took the <HI>Oath,</HI> and promi&s;ed to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in the Hands of a Friend &amp;c.</P>
<P>And thus Ends this famous &amp; FIRST <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> or rather <HI>Clergical Court</HI> in the BRITISH COLONIES. But what a Thou|&s;and Pities, that it was not the fir&s;t Time erected, to puni&s;h &s;ome <HI>notorious Immorality</HI> or other either in the <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergy</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> to <HI>whom alone</HI> it belongs, and among whom, <HI>as well as others,</HI> there are <HI>notorious Immoralities</HI> enough abounding in all the Colonies? Or if an <HI>Epi&s;copal Clergyman</HI> mu&s;t be the primary Object of this Commi&s;&s;arial Power &amp; Severity; what a thou&s;and Pities, that their <HI>Fir&s;t Court</HI> was not erected to pu|ni&s;h &s;ome or other for Playing at <HI>Cards</HI> and <HI>Dice,</HI> or <HI>haunting Taverns,</HI> or <HI>too much con&s;tant Drinking,</HI> or <HI>&s;ome other Mi&s;de|meanour,</HI> which they need not take much Pains to find or prove.</P>
<P>But <HI>in&s;tead of this</HI>&mdash;To begin with <HI>a young Clergyman</HI> of &s;uch extraordinary Sanctity of Manners, and of &s;uch &s;laming Zeal to promote the highe&s;t Degrees of Piety, as we find none &s;uperiour &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Days &mdash; It cannot po&s;&s;ibly re|commend <HI>the&s;e Courts</HI> to the E&s;teem of the Briti&s;h Colonies; but rather to their univer&s;al and great Di&s;plea&s;ure. For tho' the <HI>common People</HI> in EUROPE are generally &s;o ignorant and weak as to hug the Chains of the Clergy, and keep them on as fa&s;t and long as po&s;&s;ible &mdash; the AMERICANS live in a freer Air, more generally ta&s;te the Sweets of Liberty; and being nearer an Equality of Birth and Wealth, there being Land enough for every indu&s;trious Per&s;on; there are fewer a|mong them in Dependance on others, they are generally more
<PB N="59" REF="004705_0032_100DBD81DEB04ED8">knowing than the <HI>common People</HI> in EUROPE; and are not like for &s;everal Ages, or as long as this near Equality remains, to de&s;ire the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> over them</P>
<P>Upon viewing the <HI>Terms</HI> of the WRIT, I believe there is &s;carce a Man of common Sen&s;e in all the Colonies that can forbear &s;miling to read of the mighty heinous Articles ob|jected to the <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Rev.</HI> Mr WHITEFIELD&mdash;<HI>concerning the meer</HI> HEALTH <HI>of</HI> HIS SOUL <HI>and the</HI> REFORMATION <HI>and</HI> CORRECTION OF HIS MANNERS <HI>and Excr&s;&s;es; and</HI> CHIEFLY [CHIEFLY] <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or</HI> OMITTING <HI>to u&s;e the Form of Prayers pre&s;cribed in the Communion Book</HI> Tho' every Man of common Know|lege among us knows that the <HI>Form of Prayers pre&s;cribed in the Communion Book,</HI> was Pre&s;cribed to be u&s;ed <HI>only</HI> in <HI>Epi&s;copal Churches</HI> or <HI>Chapels:</HI> and not Pre&s;cribed to be u&s;ed in other Congregations, either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> And how hugely does this Affair concern <HI>the mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> HEALTH of Mr <HI>White|field's</HI> SOUL and the <HI>Reformation</HI> and <HI>Correction</HI> of <HI>his Manners?</HI> Tho' <HI>this Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> even in a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Congregation, is the <HI>chief</HI> Thing to be objected to this mo&s;t labourious Brother Mini&s;ter; and for &s;uch an Omi&s;&s;ion chiefly or only, the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> has put Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> to near <HI>Two Hundred Pounds Sterling</HI> Charge, which I &s;uppo&s;e is near <HI>Two Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Carolina Currency, to carry his <HI>Appeal</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and main|tain it There.</P>
<P>And is not &s;uch a prodigious Expence as this a <HI>grievous Per&s;ecution?</HI> or is Mr. <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> &s;o full of Humanity as to account it no Per&s;ecution at all?&mdash; the <HI>Crime</HI> &s;o great, and the <HI>Fine</HI> &s;o little! &mdash;I &s;aid the <HI>Fine;</HI> For tho' &s;trictly &s;peaking, it may not be called a <HI>Fine;</HI> it is in Reality <HI>E|qually heavy</HI> on the helple&s;s Sufferer.
