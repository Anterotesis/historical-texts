<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">I. IN An&s;wer to yours of the Third In|&s;tant, I much condole with you your unhappy Circum&s;tances, of being pla|ced among&s;t &s;uch Company, where, as you &s;ay, you continually hear the Sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and the Hi&s;tories therein contain|ed, particularly of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and all <HI>Revealed</HI> Religion, turned into Ridicule, by Men who &s;et up for <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> And they &s;ay, That there is no greater Ground to believe in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than in <HI>Maho|met;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="003675_0003_100244999BD6C138">That all the&s;e Pretences to <HI>Revelation</HI> are <HI>Cheats,</HI> and ever have been among <HI>Pa|gans, Jews, Mahometans,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> That they are all alike Impo&s;itions of <HI>Cun|ning</HI> and <HI>De&s;igning Men,</HI> upon the <HI>Creduli|ty,</HI> at fir&s;t, of <HI>&s;imple</HI> and <HI>unthinking</HI> People, till, their Numbers encrea&s;ing, their Delu&s;i|ons grew <HI>popular,</HI> came at la&s;t to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by Laws; and then the Force of <HI>Edu|cation,</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> gives a Bya&s;s to the Judg|ments of after Ages, till &s;uch Deceits come really to be believ'd, being receiv'd upon <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> from the Ages foregoing, without exami|ning into the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Bottom</HI> of them. Which the&s;e our modern Men of <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> (as they de&s;ire to be e&s;teem'd) &s;ay, That they only do, that they only have their <HI>Judg|ments</HI> freed from the &s;lavi&s;h Authority of <HI>Pre|cedents</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> in Matters of <HI>Truth,</HI> which, they &s;ay, ought only to be decided by <HI>Rea|&s;on;</HI> tho' by a rudent Compliance with <HI>Po|pularity</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> they pre&s;erve them&s;elves from <HI>Outrage,</HI> and legal <HI>Penalties;</HI> for none of their Complexion are addicted to <HI>Sufferings,</HI> or <HI>Martyrdom.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Sir, That which you de&s;ire from me, is, &s;ome &s;hort Topic of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> if &s;uch can be found, whereby, without running to <HI>Au|thorities,</HI> and the intricate Mazes of <HI>Learn|ning,</HI> which breed long Di&s;putes, and which the&s;e Men of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> deny by whole&s;ale, tho'
<PB N="5" REF="003675_0004_100202B1B0033E98">they can give no <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for it; only &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Authors</HI> have been Trump'd upon us, <HI>Interpolated,</HI> and <HI>Corrupted,</HI> &s;o that no Stre&s;s can be laid upon them, tho' it cannot be &s;hewn wherein they are &s;o <HI>Corrupted;</HI> which, in Rea&s;on, ought to lie upon them to prove, who alledge it; otherwi&s;e it is not only a <HI>Precarious,</HI> but a <HI>Guilty Plea:</HI> And the more, that they refrain not to quote Books on their Side, for who&s;e Authority there are no better, or not &s;o good Grounds. How|ever, you &s;ay, it makes your Di&s;putes end|le&s;s, and they go away with Noi&s;e and Cla|mour, and a Boa&s;t, That there is nothing, at lea&s;t nothing <HI>Certain,</HI> to be &s;aid on the <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> Side. Therefore you are de&s;irous to find &s;ome <HI>one Topic of Rea&s;on,</HI> which &s;hould demon|&s;trate the Truth of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and at the &s;ame Time, di&s;tingui&s;h it from the <HI>Impo&s;tures</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the old <HI>Pagan</HI> World: That our <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> may be brought to this <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> and be either obliged to renounce their <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and the common <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> or to &s;ubmit to the clear Proof, from <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, which mu&s;t be &s;uch a <HI>Proof,</HI> as no <HI>Impo&s;ture</HI> can pretend to, otherwi&s;e it cannot prove the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion not to be an <HI>Impo&s;ture.</HI> And, whether &s;uch a Proof, one &s;ingle Proof (to avoid Confu&s;ion) is not to be &s;ound out, you de&s;ire to know from me.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003675_0005_1002449C01477420">
And you &s;ay, That you cannot imagine but there mu&s;t be &s;uch a <HI>Proof,</HI> becau&s;e every <HI>Truth</HI> is in it&s;elf <HI>Clear,</HI> and <HI>One;</HI> and there|fore, that <HI>One</HI> Rea&s;on for it, if it be the true Rea&s;on, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient; and if <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> it is better than <HI>many;</HI> for Multiplicity con|founds, e&s;pecially to weak Judgments.</P>
<P>Sir, You have impos'd an hard Task up|on me; I wi&s;h I could perform it: For tho' <HI>every Truth</HI> is <HI>One,</HI> yet our Sight is &s;o feeble, that we cannot (always) come to it <HI>directly,</HI> but by many <HI>Inferences,</HI> and laying of Things together.</P>
<P>But I think, that in the Ca&s;e before us, there is &s;uch a Proof as You require, and I will &s;et it down as <HI>&s;hort</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> as I can.</P>
<P N="2">II. Fir&s;t then, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Truth of the Doctrine of</HI> CHRIST, will be &s;uffici|ently evinced, if the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> which are recorded of him in the <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> be <HI>true;</HI> for his <HI>Miracles,</HI> if <HI>true,</HI> do vouch the <HI>Truth</HI> of what he delivered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is to be &s;aid as to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> If he brought the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> in that miraculous Manner, which is related in <HI>Exodus,</HI> and did &s;uch other won|derful Things as are there told of him, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that he was &s;ent from GOD: The&s;e being the &s;tronge&s;t Proofs we can de&s;ire, and which every <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> will con|fe&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="003675_0006_1002035245AFA488">he would acquie&s;ce in, if he &s;aw them with his Eyes. Therefore the Stre&s;s of this Cau&s;e will depend upon the Proof of the&s;e <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And the Method I will take, is, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To lay down &s;uch <HI>Rules,</HI> as to the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> in General, that where they All meet, &s;uch <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> cannot be <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> And then, <HI>Secondly,</HI> To &s;hew that all the&s;e <HI>Rules</HI> do meet in the <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and that they do not meet in the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Maho|met,</HI> of the <HI>Heathen Deities,</HI> or can po&s;&s;i|bly meet in any <HI>Impo&s;ture</HI> what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Rules</HI> are the&s;e. 1&s;t. <HI>That the</HI> Matters of Fact <HI>be &s;uch, as that Mens out|ward Sen&s;es, their</HI> Eyes <HI>and</HI> Ears, <HI>may be Judges of it.</HI> 2. <HI>That it be done</HI> Publick|ly, <HI>in the Face of the World.</HI> 3. <HI>That not only publick</HI> Monuments <HI>be kept up in Me|mory of it, but &s;ome outward</HI> Actions <HI>to be performed.</HI> 4. <HI>That &s;uch</HI> Monuments <HI>and &s;uch</HI> Actions <HI>or</HI> Ob&s;ervances <HI>be</HI> in&s;tituted, <HI>and do</HI> commence <HI>from the</HI> Time that <HI>the</HI> Mat|ter of Fact <HI>was done.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Two</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Rules</HI> make it impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;uch <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> to be impo&s;ed upon Men, at the Time when &s;uch <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was &s;aid to be done, becau&s;e every Man's <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> would contradict it. For Example: Suppo&s;e any Man &s;hould pre|tend,
<PB N="8" REF="003675_0007_1002449F64665430">that Ye&s;terday he divided the <HI>Thames,</HI> in Pre&s;ence of all the People of <HI>London,</HI> and carried the whole City, <HI>Men, Women,</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> over to <HI>Southwark,</HI> on dry Land, the <HI>Waters</HI> &s;tanding like Walls on both Sides: I &s;ay, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible that he could per&s;wade the People of <HI>London,</HI> that this was true, when every <HI>Man, Woman,</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> could contradict him, and &s;ay, That this was a notorious Fal&s;hood, for that they had not &s;een the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;o divided, or had gone over on dry Land. Therefore I take it for grant|ed, (and I &s;uppo&s;e, with the Allowance of all the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> in the World) that no &s;uch Impo&s;ition could be put upon Men, at the <HI>Time</HI> when &s;uch <HI>publick Matter of Fact</HI> was &s;aid to be done.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore it only remains, that &s;uch <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> might be invented &s;ome Time after, when the Men of that Generation, wherein the Thing was &s;aid to be done, are all pa&s;t and gone; and the Credulity of af|ter Ages might be impo&s;ed upon, to believe that Things were done in former Ages, which were not.</P>
<P>And for this, the <HI>Two</HI> la&s;t <HI>Rules</HI> &s;ecure us, as much as the <HI>Two</HI> fir&s;t <HI>Rules,</HI> in the for|mer Ca&s;e; for whenever &s;uch a <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> came to be invented, if not only <HI>Mo|numents</HI> were &s;aid to remain of it, but like|wi&s;e that publick <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervances</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003675_0008_100203543A93F4D8">were con&s;tantly u&s;ed ever &s;ince the <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was &s;aid to be done, the Deceit mu&s;t be detected, by no &s;uch <HI>Monuments</HI> appear|ing, and by the Experience of every <HI>Man, Woman,</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> who mu&s;t know that no &s;uch <HI>Actions,</HI> or <HI>Ob&s;ervances,</HI> were ever us'd by them. For Example, Suppo&s;e I &s;hould now invent a Story of &s;uch a Thing done a Thou&s;and Years ago, I might, perhaps, get &s;ome to believe it; but if I &s;ay, that not on|ly &s;uch a Thing was done, but that from that Day to this, every Man, at the Age of <HI>Twelve</HI> Years, had a <HI>Joint</HI> of his <HI>Little Finger</HI> cut off; and that every Man in the Nation did want a <HI>Joint</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Finger;</HI> and that this <HI>In&s;titution</HI> was &s;aid to be Part of the <HI>Mat|ter of Fact</HI> done &s;o many Years ago, and vouch'd as a <HI>Proof</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of it, and as having de&s;cended, without Interrup|tion, and been con&s;tantly practic'd, in Memo|ry of &s;uch <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> all along, from the Time that &s;uch <HI>Matter of Fact</HI> was done: I &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be believed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, becau&s;e every one could con|tradict me, as to the <HI>Mark</HI> of cutting off a <HI>Joint</HI> of the <HI>Finger;</HI> and that being Part of my original <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> mu&s;t demon|&s;trate the whole to be fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let us now come to the <HI>Second</HI> Point, to &s;hew, that the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="003675_0009_100244A0ECEB0218">and of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> have all the&s;e <HI>Rules,</HI> or <HI>Marks</HI> before mentioned; and that neither the <HI>Mat|ters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or what is report|ed of the <HI>Heathen Deities,</HI> have the like; and that no <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> can have them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it will be allow'd me, that he could not have per&s;waded 600000 Men, that he had brought them out of <HI>Ae|gypt,</HI> thro' the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> fed them 40 Years without <HI>Bread,</HI> by miraculous <HI>Manna,</HI> and the other <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> recorded in his Books, if they had not been true. Becau&s;e every Man's <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> that were then alive, mu&s;t have cantradicted it. And therefore he mu&s;t have impos'd upon all their <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> if he could have made them believe it, when it was <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> and no &s;uch Things done. So that here are the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> of the above mentioned <HI>Four</HI> Marks.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, it was equally im|po&s;&s;ible for him to have made them receive his <HI>Five</HI> Books, as Truth, and not to have rejected them, as a manife&s;t <HI>Impo&s;ture;</HI> which told of all the&s;e Things as done before their <HI>Eyes,</HI> if they had not been &s;o done. See how po&s;itively he &s;peaks to them, <HI>Deut.</HI> xi. 2. to Ver. 8. <HI>And know you this Day, for I &s;peak not with your Children, which have not known, and which have not &s;een the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Lord your God, his Greatne&s;s, his mighty Hand, and his &s;tretched out Arm, and his
<PB N="11" REF="003675_0010_1002036713CFAF90">Miracles, and his Acts, which he did in the mid&s;t of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>unto</HI> Pharaoh, <HI>the King of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>and unto all his Land, and what he did unto the Army of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>unto their Hor&s;es, and to their Chariots; how he made the Water of the</HI> Red Sea <HI>to overflow them as they pur&s;ued after you; and how the Lord hath de&s;troyed them unto this Day: And what he did unto you in the Wilderne&s;s, un|til ye came into this Place; and what he did unto</HI> Dathan <HI>and</HI> Abiram, <HI>the Sons of</HI> Eliab, <HI>the Son of</HI> Reuben; <HI>how the Earth opened her Mouth, and &s;wallowed them up, and their Hou&s;holds, and their Tents, and all the Sub|&s;tance that was in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the mid&s;t of all</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>But your Eyes have &s;een all the great Acts of the Lord, which he did,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From hence we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (if an Impo&s;ture) could have been invented, and put upon the People, who were then alive, when all the&s;e Things were &s;aid to be done.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t therefore that even a <HI>Suppo&s;e</HI> can &s;tretch to, is, that the&s;e Books were wrote in &s;ome Age after <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and put out in his Name.</P>
<P>And to this, I &s;ay, that if it was &s;o, it was impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e <HI>Books</HI> &s;hould have been received as the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in that Age wherein they may have been &s;uppos'd to have
<PB N="12" REF="003675_0011_100244A4212F1E00">been fir&s;t invented. Why? Becau&s;e they &s;peak of them&s;elves as delivered by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and kept in the <HI>Ark</HI> from his Time. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s, when</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>had made an End of writing the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were fini&s;hed, that</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>commanded the</HI> Levites <HI>who bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, &s;aying, take this Book of the Law, and put it in the Side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witne&s;s again&s;t thee,</HI> Deut. xxxi. 24, 25, 26. And there was a <HI>Copy</HI> of this <HI>Book</HI> to be left like|wi&s;e with the <HI>King. And it &s;hall be when he &s;itteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he &s;hall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prie&s;ts the</HI> Levites: <HI>And it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the Days of his Life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep all the Words of this Law, and the&s;e Statutes, to do them,</HI> Deut. xvii. 18, 19.</P>
<P>Here you &s;ee, that this Book of the <HI>Law</HI> &s;peaks of it &s;elf, not only as an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> or <HI>Relation</HI> of what Things were then done; but as the <HI>&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>municipal Law</HI> and <HI>Sta|tutes</HI> of the <HI>Nation</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> binding the <HI>King</HI> as well as the <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in whatever Age after <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> you will &s;uppo&s;e this <HI>Book</HI> to have been <HI>forged,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="003675_0012_1002446F457CE070">it was impo&s;&s;ible it could be received as Truth, becau&s;e it was not then to be found, either in the <HI>Ark,</HI> or with the <HI>King,</HI> or any where el&s;e: For when fir&s;t invented, every Body mu&s;t know, that they had never heard of it before.</P>
<P>And therefore they could le&s;s believe it to be the <HI>Book</HI> of their <HI>Statutes,</HI> and the &s;tanding <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Land,</HI> which they had all along received, and by which they had been <HI>Go|verned.</HI></P>
<P>Could any Man, now at this Day, invent a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Statutes,</HI> or <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> and make it pa&s;s upon the Na|tion, as the only <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Statutes</HI> that ever they had known? As impo&s;&s;ible was it for the <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (if they were invented in any Age after <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) to have been received for what they declare them&s;elves to be, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Statutes</HI> and <HI>Municipal Law</HI> of the Nation of the <HI>Jews:</HI> And to have per&s;waded the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they had <HI>Own'd</HI> and <HI>Acknow|ledg'd</HI> the&s;e <HI>Books,</HI> all along from the Days of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to that Day in which they were fir&s;t invented; that is, that they had <HI>Own'd</HI> them before they had ever &s;o much as <HI>Heard</HI> of them. Nay more, the whole Nation mu&s;t, in an In&s;tant, forget their former <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> if they could receive the&s;e <HI>Books</HI> as being their <HI>Former</HI> Laws. And they could not otherwi&s;e receive them, becau&s;e they
<PB N="14" REF="003675_0013_100244A685401208">vouch'd them&s;elves &s;o to be. Let me ask the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> but this One &s;hort Que&s;tion: Was there ever a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Sham Laws,</HI> which were not the <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Nation, Pam'd</HI> upon any <HI>People,</HI> &s;ince the World began? If not, With what Face can they &s;ay this of the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Jews?</HI> Why will they &s;ay that of them, which they confe&s;s impo&s;&s;ible in any <HI>Nation,</HI> or among any <HI>People?</HI></P>
<P>But they mu&s;t be yet more unrea&s;onable: For the Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> have a further De|mon&s;tration of their Truth, than even other <HI>Law-Books</HI> have: For they not only contain the <HI>Laws,</HI> but give an <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Account of their <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> and the <HI>Practice</HI> of them from that Time: As of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> in Me|mory of the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Fir&s;t-Born</HI> in <HI>Aegypt:</HI>

<P>If the Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> had been only taking Advantage of a <HI>Spring-Tide,</HI> or the like, How would this teach <HI>all the People of the Earth, that the Hand of the Lord was Mighty!</HI> How would a Thing no more remarkable, have been taken Notice of thro' all the World!

Nor of this Book of <HI>Jo&s;hua?</HI> Where has it been all this while? And <HI>Where,</HI> and <HI>How</HI> came you, after &s;o ma|ny Ages, to find it? Be&s;ides, this Book tells Us, that this <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> over <HI>Jordan</HI> was or|dain'd to be taught our <HI>Children,</HI> from Age to Age: And therefore, that they were always to be <HI>in&s;tructed</HI> in the Meaning of that <HI>Sto|nage</HI> at <HI>Gilgal,</HI> as a <HI>Memorial</HI> of it.

<P>And if, for the Rea&s;ons before given, no &s;uch <HI>Impo&s;ition</HI> could be put upon us, as to the <HI>Stonage</HI> in <HI>Salisbury-Plain;</HI> How much le&s;s could it be as to the <HI>Stonage</HI> at <HI>Gilgal?</HI></P>

<P N="4">IV.

<P>And the Truth of the <HI>Matters of Fact</HI> of <HI>Exodus</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> being no otherwi&s;e pre&s;s'd upon Men, than as they have practis'd &s;uch <HI>publick In&s;titutions;</HI> it is appealing to the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> of Mankind for the <HI>Truth</HI> of them; and makes it impo&s;&s;ible for any to have in|vented &s;uch Stories in after-Ages, without a palpable Detection of the Cheat, when fir&s;t invented; as impo&s;&s;ible as to have impos'd upon the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> at the Time when &s;uch <HI>publick Matters of Fact</HI> were &s;aid to be done.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do not &s;ay, that every Thing which wants the&s;e Four <HI>Marks</HI> is <HI>fal&s;e;</HI> but that nothing can be <HI>Fal&s;e</HI> which has them <HI>All.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Manner of Doubt, that there was &s;uch a Man as <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> that he fought at <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> was killed in the <HI>Senate Hou&s;e;</HI> and many other Matters of Fact of ancient Times, tho' we keep no publick Ob|&s;ervances in Memory of them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003675_0031_100244BA2EA7AE08">
But this &s;hews that the Matters of Fact of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> have come down to us better guarded than any other Matters of Fact, how true &s;oever.</P>
<P>And yet our <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> who would laugh any Man out of the World, as an irrational Brute, who &s;hould offer to deny <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or <HI>Alexan|der, Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> their publick Works and Actions, do, at the &s;ame Time, value them&s;elves as the only Men of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> of <HI>Free, Generous,</HI> and <HI>Unbya&s;s'd Judgments,</HI> for ridiculing the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that are infinitely better atte&s;ted, and guard|ed with infallible Marks, which the others want.</P>
<P N="6">VI.

<P>But our very <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> both this <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> are concern'd in the <HI>Truth</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="003675_0032_10024484DBF21938">of what is related in the Holy Scriptures; and therefore Men would be more inqui&s;itive to &s;earch into the Truth of the&s;e, than of any other Matters of Fact; examine and &s;ift them narrowly; and find out the <HI>Deceit,</HI> if any &s;uch could be found: For it <HI>concern'd</HI> them <HI>nearly,</HI> and was of the la&s;t Importance to them.</P>

<P N="10">X.

<P>And the great Argument they go upon is this, That a <HI>Miracle</HI> being that which ex|ceeds the <HI>Power of Nature,</HI> We cannot know what <HI>exceeds</HI> it, unle&s;s we knew the utmo&s;t <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Nature;</HI> and no

<P>To which I an&s;wer, That Men may be &s;o <HI>Cheated.</HI> And there are many Examples of it.</P>
<P>But that tho' we may not always <HI>Know</HI> when we are <HI>Cheated,</HI> yet we can <HI>certainly</HI> tell, in many Ca&s;es, when we are <HI>not cheated.</HI></P>
<P>For tho' we do not know the utmo&s;t <HI>Ex|tent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Nature,</HI> perhaps, in any <HI>One</HI> Thing; yet it does not follow, that we know not the <HI>Nature</HI> of any Thing, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure; and that <HI>certainly</HI> too. For Ex|ample, tho' I do not know the utmo&s;t <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>Power of Fire,</HI> yet I <HI>certainly</HI> know, That it is the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> to <HI>burn;</HI> and, that when proper <HI>Fewel</HI> is admini&s;tred to it, it is contrary to the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Fire</HI> not to <HI>con&s;ume</HI> it. Therefore, if I &s;ee <HI>Three</HI> Men taken off the Street, in their common wear|ing Apparel, and without any <HI>Preparation,</HI> ca&s;t into the Mid&s;t of a <HI>Burning Fiery Fur|nace;</HI> and that the <HI>Flame</HI> was &s;o <HI>fierce,</HI> that it <HI>burnt</HI> up tho&s;e Men that drew them in; and yet that the&s;e who were thrown in, &s;hould walk up and down in the <HI>Bottom</HI> of the <HI>Fur|nace,</HI> and I &s;hould &s;ee a <HI>Fourth</HI> Per&s;on with them of <HI>Glorious</HI> Appearance, like the Son of

<P>Again, tho' I cannot tell how <HI>Wonderful</HI> and <HI>Sudden</HI> an <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of <HI>Corn</HI> might be pro|duc'd by the Concurrence of many <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> as a <HI>Warm Climate,</HI> the <HI>Fertility</HI> of the <HI>Soil,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>And therefore, tho' we may be <HI>Cheated</HI> and impos'd upon in many <HI>Seeming Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Wonders;</HI> yet there are &s;ome Things, wherein we may be <HI>Certain.</HI></P>

But further, the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> acknowledge a <HI>God,</HI> of an <HI>Almighty Power,</HI> who made all Things.</P>

<HEAD>XII. <HI>Of</HI> Infallibility <HI>in the</HI> Church.</HEAD>
<P>But there is an <HI>Infallibility</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> not <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> in any <HI>One,</HI> or <HI>All</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> put together; for Millions of <HI>Fallibles</HI> can never make an <HI>Infallible.</HI> But the <HI>Infalli|bility</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Nature of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> which having all the Four <HI>Marks</HI> mentioned in <HI>The Short Method with the</HI> Dei&s;ts, can|not po&s;&s;ibly be fal&s;e. As you and I believe there is &s;uch a Town as <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that there was &s;uch a Man as <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. as much as if we had &s;een them with our Eyes: Not from the Credit of any <HI>Hi&s;torian,</HI> or <HI>Travel|ler,</HI> all of whom are <HI>Fallible;</HI> but from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> wherein it is <HI>Im|po&s;&s;ible</HI> for Men to have con&s;pir'd and car|ry'd it on without <HI>Contradiction,</HI> if it were <HI>Fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, whatever <HI>Doctrine</HI> has been taught in the <HI>Church,</HI> (according to the Rule of <HI>Vincentius Lirinen&s;is,</HI>) <HI>&s;emper, ubique, &amp;
<PB N="84" REF="003675_0083_100244F5E82A4D88">ab omnibus,</HI> is the <HI>Chri&s;tian Doctrine;</HI> for in this Ca&s;e, &s;uch <HI>Doctrine</HI> is a <HI>Fact,</HI> and having the fore&s;aid <HI>Marks,</HI> mu&s;t be a true <HI>Fact, viz.</HI> That &s;uch <HI>Doctrine</HI> was &s;o taught and receiv'd.</P>
<P>This was the Method taken in the <HI>Council</HI> call'd at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Arius;</HI> it was ask'd by <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> who pre&s;ided, <HI>Quis unquam talia audivit?</HI> Who ever heard of this <HI>Doctrine</HI> before? And it being an&s;wered by all the Bi&s;hops there a&s;&s;em|bled in the Negative, it was concluded a <HI>No|vel Doctrine,</HI> and contrary to what had been <HI>Univer&s;ally</HI> received in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church.</HI> Thus every <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be reduc'd to <HI>Fact;</HI> for it is purely <HI>Fact,</HI> whether &s;uch <HI>Doctrine</HI> was receiv'd, or not.</P>
<P>And a <HI>Council</HI> a&s;&s;embled upon &s;uch an Oc|ca&s;ion, <HI>&s;tand</HI> as <HI>Evidences</HI> of the <HI>Fact,</HI> not as <HI>Judges</HI> of the <HI>Faith;</HI> which they cannot al|ter by their <HI>Votes</HI> or <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Council</HI> has <HI>Authority</HI> in Matters of <HI>Di&s;|cipline</HI> in the <HI>Church;</HI> but in Matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> what is called their <HI>Authority,</HI> is their <HI>Atte&s;tation</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Fact;</HI> which, if it has the <HI>Marks</HI> before mentioned, mu&s;t be <HI>Infallibly</HI> true: Not from the <HI>Infallibility</HI> of any or all of the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> but from the Na|ture of the <HI>Evidence,</HI> as before is &s;aid.</P>
<P>And this is the &s;ure&s;t Rule, whereby to <HI>Judge</HI> of <HI>Doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rines,</HI> and to know what the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> has <HI>Believ'd</HI> and <HI>Taught,</HI> as <HI>Receiv'd</HI> from the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
