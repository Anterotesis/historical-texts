<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO great a prevalence has cu&s;tom, that to &s;ee an Engli&s;h book without a Preface, is as &s;trange a &s;ight as a bull without horns, the wea|pons of his defence. If this little Hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h Robbers has any occa&s;ion of a Preface, it can only be to obviate one objection that may be made by cavillers again&s;t it, viz. <Q>Rogues merit no commendation; and therefore men ought to be cautious of introducing their actions in Hi&s;|tory, le&s;t it &s;hould be an encouragement to others to follow their example:</Q> But I can a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that my intention is quite different: I have wrote with no other de&s;ign than to di&s;courage young men from falling into &s;uch company as may lead them into a &s;hameful way of living, which often brings them to an ill end, and leaves a reproach upon their family, who may be inno|cent. We may ob&s;erve the great Redmond O'Hanlon, though he lived a merry life, yet it was but &s;hort, and attended with &s;uch dangers and fear, that he could have but little &s;atisfaction, and at length he became &s;uch an odium, that one of his own relations, for the lucre of a reward, di&s;|patched him out of the world as he lay a&s;leep. How &s;afely, then can an outlawed rogue leave
<PB N="iv" REF="035355_0003_10049CABAEE2F1E8">his life in the power of another, when induced not only by the promi&s;e of a reward, but for the &s;ake of pardon to give information? And if a man has occa&s;ion to di&s;tru&s;t his own comrades, with how much di&s;&s;atisfaction mu&s;t he live? It is true, he may riot for a while, but let him take care, <Q>le&s;t (according to the P&s;almi&s;t) he be cut off in his wickedne&s;s, and die in his &s;ins.</Q></P>
<P>I hope the following Hi&s;tory may al&s;o be of &s;ervice to hone&s;t men of all profe&s;&s;ions, who may happen to have dealings, though at unawares, with &s;uch kind of cattle as are here treated of.&mdash; By making our&s;elves acquainted with their arti|fices and ways of management, we may be bet|ter able to know how to di&s;cover their wiles, and break their mea&s;ures. When a man is forewarn+ed, if he does not &s;ore-arm him&s;elf, I believe all men will think him blame-worthy. I am &s;ure this is my opinion, who am a well wi&s;her to all men.</P>

<HEAD>A GENUINE HISTORY OF THE LIVES AND ACTIONS of the mo&s;t notorious Iri&s;h ROGUES and RAPPAREES.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH it is very probable that Ireland has produced a great many barbarians and murderers from the beginning, yet as the ancient hi&s;tories of that nation are &s;o very fabulous, that little or no credit can be given to them, we &s;hall begin with the lives of &s;uch, the veracity where|of cannot be called in que&s;tion; and, as among the Iri&s;h robbers of modern date none appears to be more remarkable and notorious than Redmond O'Hanlon, the reader is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ired to let him lead the van.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;urprizing Hi&s;tory of Redmond O'Hanlon, protector of the rights and properties of the benefactors, and captain general of the Iri&s;h robbers; almo&s;t notorious, though a gentleman|like robber.</HEAD>
<P>REDMOND O'H&mdash;N was the &s;on of a re|putable Iri&s;h gentleman, who had a con&s;i|derable e&s;tate, and lived at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Sleygunnin mountains, in the county of Armagh, among a va&s;t number of relations, &s;everal where|of were of the &s;ame name. After his parents had given him the be&s;t education the time and place afforded, they obtained for him a &s;mall po&s;t in the army, where he &s;erved a few years with pretty good credit, though very young, 'till the reduction of the Iri&s;h forces in this kingdom, a|mong which our Redmond was one.</P>
<P>The nation being reduced by the Engli&s;h fore+ces, &s;everal Iri&s;h families, who had a hand in the wars of Ireland were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and their lands forfeited; by which means a very great alterae+tion was made in this family, and &s;everal of thn O'H&mdash;ns were obliged to travel, in hopes of retrieving their fortunes. But poor Redmond, in this unhappy condition, once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and fly|ing for &s;afety, &s;taid abroad for a long time, &s;till refu&s;ing to come to trial 'till he was outlawed, which put him to his &s;hifts. But our hero ha|ving received &s;ome in&s;tructions in the art of war, and being naturally of an undaunted courage,
<PB N="7" REF="035355_0006_10049CB6D3C6B6B0">was ea&s;ily led into the &s;ecret of invading other men's properties, both on the highway, and by breaking open of hou&s;es, till he had acquired as much money as might have put him in a way to live above the frowns of fortune, with good ma|nagement, all his life.</P>
<P>But &s;eeming to reli&s;h this new cour&s;e of life more than the former, he proceeded in his rob|beries, 'till from an infancy in the art, he be|came one of the mo&s;t notorious and expert of that profe&s;&s;ion that had ever been bred in the kingdom of Ireland. He had made him&s;elf ac|quainted with all the bye pa&s;&s;ages in the coun|try, and he knew all the lurking places on the mountains of Newry and Sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gun in, &s;o that whoever pretended to pur&s;ue him, made but fruitle&s;s attempts, and commonly returned with lo&s;s and &s;hame, like dogs that lo&s;t their ears, both before and after the rewards were offered by the government for apprehending him.</P>
<P>He was &s;trong and active, and as occa&s;ion re|quired, could perform his feats either on foot or on hor&s;eback: but though he was &s;o notorious a plunderer, he was naturally of a very generous di&s;po&s;ition, frequently giving &s;hare of what he got from the rich to relieve the poor in their ne|ce&s;&s;ities. His remarkable actions and &s;urpri&s;ing attempts, &s;pread his character through all the country; and being joined by a great number of his former acquaintance (adventerous lads who became his a&s;&s;ociates &s;pontaneou&s;ly) 'till his company was augmented to fifty effective men, mo&s;tly his own relations, he then began to take upon a captain's command, and appointed a bri|gade
<PB N="8" REF="035355_0007_10049CB8949666A8">to act in every province, who were always to return (barring accidents) four times a year to their general place of rendezvous and give an account of their &s;ucce&s;s, and as &s;oon as the booty was regularly divided, each brigade was ordered to exchange po&s;ts, and to march out on duty again. This was their con&s;tant practice for &s;ome years, by which policy they kept them&s;elves concealed much longer than they otherwi&s;e could have done. However, there was no robbery committed any where at all in the kingdom but was attributed to Captain O'H&mdash;n, though it is probable he might be an hundred miles di&s;tant at the &s;ame time: nay, &s;o well was his character e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;o notorious his actions, that it became a common proverb, when any man had a mind to brand another with infamy and &s;candal, for him to &s;ay, "You are as great a rogue as Redmond O'H&mdash;n."</P>
<P>As Redmond was once travelling along the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad between Newry and Armagh, like a kite in the air in que&s;t of prey, with only two or three attendants, who were at &s;ome di&s;tance behind him, he overtook a pedlar, crying out and be|moaning his misfortune, in a very moving and hi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous manner. Redmond taking compa&s;&s;ion of the pedlar, came up and a&s;ked what had befallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im? To whom the pedlar replied, "Teat damn'd rogue of a Redmond O'H&mdash;n has robbed me of above five pounds in money, which was all I had; and that would not &s;atisfy him either, but he has taken my box away too; and becau&s;e I &s;trove to hold it, he knocked me down, and abu&s;|ed me like a dog." Redmond incen&s;ed at &s;uch
<PB N="9" REF="035355_0008_1004997BB83A2A40">language, had hardly patience to hear him tell out his &s;tory before he interrupted him, and call|ed him a ra&s;cal and a lying &s;on of a whore.&mdash; 'How could I rob you you, (&s;aid he) that never &s;aw you before? You dog, &s;hew me which way he went, and I'll convince you that it was none of Redmond O'H&mdash;n that robbed you. By the time the fellow had de&s;cribed the robber, and &s;hewed the road he took, Redmond's compa|ny came up, and they all went in pur&s;uit of the new rogue, whom they overtook, with the ped|lar's box under his arm, and brought him back to the place where he committed the robbery. He knew him&s;elf guilty of the fact, and returned the pedlar both his money and box, without waiting to be examined, being no way acquainted with Redmond or any of his party. Upon this Cap|tain O'H&mdash;n &s;aid, he would teach him to rob in his name, and without his licence or permi&s;|&s;ion, and bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he pedlar under an obligation to pro&s;ecute the fellow at the en&s;uing a&s;&s;izes, and then wrote a mittimus, and &s;ent the criminal un|der a proper guard to the jail of Armagh. The pedlar was as good as his word, pro&s;ecuted him to the very utmo&s;t, upon which the fellow being found guilty, was accordingly executed. He was not altogether &s;o de&s;titute of friends but that he had council to plead for him, who in&s;i&s;ted very much upon the error in commitment, and

<P>Redmond had a much greater antipathy to the Engli&s;h than to the Scotch or Iri&s;h; for he was always kind to his country men, and made a bargain both with them and the North country pedlars, and all &s;uch as acknowledged his juri&s;|diction all over the kingdom; alledging for ex|ce&s;s, that as he was a reduced gentleman, he hoped his country men would not refu&s;e to pay him tribute towards his maintenance, upon his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ing to plunder. Upon this he made propo|&s;als, that who&s;oever paid him half a crown per annum, he would indem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ify them from robbers of all kinds: but if at any time they neglected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">t him his &s;alary, and run in arrears, they
<PB N="11" REF="035355_0010_10049CC24F3DFA40">were &s;ure to pay for it. Such as made this bar|gain with him, had their names regi&s;tered in his pocket-book, and were &s;o little afraid of lo&s;ing any of their goods by robbers, that they thought their effects as &s;afe in the field as in the hou&s;e; for if at any time they happened to have any thing &s;tolen, upon application to Redmond, he would make the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch that could po&s;&s;ibly be made through all parts of the king|dom, till he found it and re&s;tored it to the own|er; and if he falled to find it, always allowed his benefactor two years &s;alary to compen&s;ate the lo&s;s. But he had &s;o many emi&s;aries, and &s;uch good intelligence, and all other petty rogues were &s;o much afraid of him and his party, that none of them dared di&s;oblige him; and be&s;ides, every robber was &s;erved with a copy of the re|gi&s;tered names, and had &s;trict orders not to med|dle with any thing that belonged to &s;uch, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t the lo&s;er in &s;earching for their goods: &s;o that his friends &s;eldom &s;uffered under his protec|tion.</P>
<P>Having once got cold, upon &s;ome de&s;perate occa&s;ion, it threw him into a dangerous fever, of which he recovered; yet the place being damp where he lay, he lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs, and
<PB N="12" REF="035355_0011_10049CC406C9E270">continued a cripple or lame for &s;ome years: yet during this time he was pre&s;erved among his friends, who had a great e&s;teem for him, and e&s;caped from being taken, though he was pro|claimed a tory and a robber, and a reward of fifty pound was offered for taking of him, which occa|&s;ioned frequent &s;earches after him. He likewi&s;e was punctually paid his &s;alary or tribute by his benefactors or allies (except a few who broke the truce, but dearly paid for it after) though robberies were not &s;o frequent during his illue&s;s as before, &s;o that he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of making his pay maintain him 'till he was able to go about again.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had recovered the u&s;e of his limbs, he took the field again, and &s;coured all the roads roads in the country, &s;ometimes alone, and &s;ometimes with company, and took &s;pecial care to revenge him&s;elf on all tho&s;e who had neglected to &s;end him his yearly pen&s;ion while he was out of order; but found him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely hunted, that he fixed his head quarters at or about the bog of Allen for a con&s;iderable time, where he committed &s;uch a number of notorious robberies, that the country was obliged to keep under arms to guard their effects. The govern|ment taking this into con&s;ideration, a fre&s;h pro|clamation was i&s;&s;ued out, offering a reward of two hundred and fifty pound for the taking of him; upon which &s;everal attempts were made to &s;ecure him, but to no effect: though he was once taken in bed near Clonbullock; but had the good fortune to be re&s;cued by his comrades, as his captors were leading him to Naas goal.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035355_0012_10049CC917B828A8">
Though he was very well acquainted all over the kingdom, yet he was loath to venture him|&s;elf any longer in this place, and among &s;trangers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tear of a &s;econd di&s;&s;a&s;ter: &s;o be took an op|portonity of conveying him&s;elf private to his old quarters on Slevgunnin, where he remained &s;ome time, and carried on his game with great &s;ucce&s;s, before his enemies had notice where to &s;eek him.</P>
<P>Soon after his return, he was in company with &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates beyond Armagh, where they met with cornet Montgomery's &s;teward, who having received about 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from his ma&s;ter's tenants on an e&s;tats he had in that country, was carrying it home to his own hou&s;e near Killevan, in the country of Monaghan, where he dwelt. Redmond &s;tood at a little di&s;tance all the time of the action, and ob&s;erved the di&s;pute on both &s;ides, and the defence made by the &s;teward, which tho' he maintained it with bravery for &s;ome time, yet he was overpowered by numbers, and obli|ged to deliver his pur&s;e to &s;ave his life. When the boots was divided, captain O'H&mdash;n made a pre&s;ent of his part to the cornet's young &s;on, who was at nur&s;e in the &s;ame place, which he &s;ent by the &s;teward, with &s;trict order to deliver it, and took his acknowledgment for the &s;ame payable on demand. This he did out of a pure regard that he had for the cornet, on account of &s;ome favour that he had done him formerly: and the cornet to make him a requital for &s;o generous an action, made a promi&s;e that he would u&s;e his be&s;t en|deavours to obtain the king's pardon for him, in hopes of his for&s;aking his new trade; and was as good as his word, as by the &s;equel will appear.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035355_0013_10049CCAAE8CEA78">
A little after this action, a merchant in Dun|dalk had a draught on a merchant in Newry for a large &s;um, but was &s;o much in dread of Redmond OH&mdash;n, that he was afraid either to &s;end for the money, or to go for it him&s;elf: while he was thus con&s;ulting with his wife how to get the money &s;afely home, his apprentice, a lad about &s;ixteen years of age, overheard their di&s;cour&s;e, and as &s;oon as he got an opportunity, de&s;ired his ma&s;ter to tell him why he was &s;o much afraid of &s;ending to Newry? The ma&s;ter having an&s;wered his reque&s;t, the boy a&s;ked him whether he would venture to tru&s;t him with &s;o much mo|ney? The ma&s;ter &s;aid he did not doubt his ho|ne&s;ty, but on that occa&s;ion he could not tell what to think of the matter: However, by many en|treaties, the boy prevailed on the ma&s;ter to let him go for the money, promi&s;ing to forfeit his ears if he lo&s;t one hal&s;penny of it. The boy ha|ving obtained privilege to go for the money, im|mediately &s;et about prepating him&s;elf for the journey; and by his n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">'s a&s;&s;itance, being provided with about forty &s;hilling in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alf pence, he divided them into two parcels, and tied them up clo&s;e in a little wallet, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ch end, and then went to the field and brought home an old vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ous &s;tone hor&s;e, (much of the &s;ame humour with Sir Teague O'Reagan's war hor&s;e, on which he rode out to meet duke S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bomberg after the &s;ur|render of Charlemount) that when any other came up to meet him on the road, be always &s;trove to bite or kick him, by which means he commonly kept the road to him&s;elf. With pro|per accoutrements the boy mounted, and had the
<PB N="15" REF="035355_0014_10049CCDA6E69670">fortune to meet Redmond on the road as he was going, who, as it was u&s;ual with him, demanded where he was going? They boy told him to Newry, 'Pray what bu&s;ine&s;s have you there? &s;ays Redmond. Why, &s;ays the boy, to receive about 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for my ma&s;ter. And when do you think you'll be back? &s;ays Redmond. Why, &s;ays the boy, I believe about this time to-morrow. Well, my good boy, &s;ays Redmond, you had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ter take care not to tell every body what year bu&s;ine&s;s is, for fear you &s;hould be robbed. Oh, &s;ays the boy, I am &s;ure &s;uch a gentleman as you would not too me; I don't intend to tell any bo|dy el&s;e.' Upon this Redmond made him a pre|&s;ent of a ducat to drink his health or to hite another hor&s;e, if the one he had under him &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ld tire; and &s;o they parted good friends for that time.</P>
<P>Redmond was then under &s;ome nece&s;ities for a little money; and as none of his companions were pre&s;ent at the dialogue, he was re&s;olved not to let them know any thing of the matter, that he might have all the booty to him&s;elf: And to make him&s;elf the more &s;ure of the prey, he or|dered his comrades to a different po&s;t the next morning, and waited him&s;elf alone on the road leading from Newry, 'till the boy returned.</P>
<P>When they boy came in &s;ight Redmond rode up and &s;aluted him, and, after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, be|gan to a&s;k him the nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion about the money. The boy &s;eeming to have no mi&s;tru&s;t of his de&s;ign confe&s;&s;ed that he had received it, upon which the other di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">red him to let him &s;ee it. The boy &s;eemingly under a &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">prize, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">e &s;everal excu&s;es, but they all availed him nothing for,
<PB N="16" REF="035355_0015_10049CCFA336E868">after a &s;hort parley, the other began to demand with &s;ome authority, and would have taken hold of him had he not been &s;omething afraid of recei|ving a kick from the mad hor&s;e. Among other excu&s;es, the boy alledged that his ma&s;ter would think that he had made away with the money him&s;elf and deem him a rogue, for which rea&s;on he could not part with it; but at length, Red|mond threatning to &s;hoot him if he refu&s;ed any longer, the boy took his wallet, and ca&s;t it over a &s;lough by the road &s;ide, and told Redmond that if he mu&s;t have it, he &s;hould follow it. Upon this Redmond alighted from his hor&s;e, and ha|ving tied him to a tree, with &s;ome difficulty he got over the &s;lough and thro' the hedge, to the place where the wallet lay.

<P>At his coming up to the door, one of the dogs began to bark, which alarmed the pur&s;uers in the center, who lay not far off; whereupon they all came up in a body and &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, ju&s;t as Redmond fat down with a cake of bread, &s;ome butter, and a can of milk before him.

<P>It was about this time that P&mdash;, the greate&s;t robber in Mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, out of mere curio&s;ity, took a journey to the country of Armagh, purely for the &s;ake of &s;eeing Redmond O'H&mdash;n, of whom he heard abundance of &s;ine &s;tories, but never had been in his company. When he came near the place of Redmond's abode, he put up at an inn, but for &s;ome private rea&s;ons made no enquiry that night; for ob&s;erving a gentleman, as he thought, telling over a good &s;ome of money, he took care to be informed which road he interded to take, in the morning; upon which he pur&s;ued him and overtook him at the &s;ide of a little wood: At coming up be demanded the gentleman's money without more ado, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld him he &s;aw him reckoning the night before: The other told him, he had money &s;ure enough, but &s;wore, that who|&s;oever took it &s;hould &s;ight for it; upon which each of them di&s;charged a pi&s;tol, but without any damage, and then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> their &s;words, without

Some offers were made for granting him his pardon; yet he was afraid to come in, and continued a &s;urvey or of the roads till his death.</P>
<P>After his refu&s;al of accepting the King's par|don, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out, and a reward offered for taking him; but he &s;till pur&s;ued his u&s;ual cour&s;es, till his character was thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed. It once happened that an en&s;ign in Cork was informed that Captain P&mdash;r was drinking alone at an ion on the road leading from Kilworth, and hearing that there was a re|ward of forty pounds offered for apprehending him, he went out within file or two of mu&s;que|teers, who all entered the hou&s;e in the evening, before P&mdash;r was aware.

<P>Capt.

After many pau&s;es the farmer at la&s;t told him, that having run in ar|rears with the landlord, he had cau&s;ed him to be &s;erved with an ejectment, and that in a few days he would be turned out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and all the effects he had taken from him; upon this P&mdash;r took compa&s;&s;ion on them, and grew more and more &s;olicitous, 'till he found out what day the landlord intended to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Then he a&s;k'd the farmer, "whether he had any friend at all that would endeavour to help him?" The farmer &s;aid he knew of none. Then &s;aid P&mdash;r, "If a friend &s;hould be &s;o kind as to lend &s;o much money (which he under&s;tood to be about &s;ixty pounds) as would clear your landlord, would you repay it again of you could." "Indeed, &s;aid the farmer, I would if I could." Well then, &s;ays P&mdash;r, here is the &s;um; I'll be your friend &s;o far as to lend it to you only upon our own note;" which he gave him, promi&s;ing not to let his landlord know that he had any money 'till he had made all the excu&s;es that were po&s;&s;ible, &s;ay even &s;o far as to let him begin to drive the cattle and turn him out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>The landlord accepted the money; but was obliged to give an acquittance in full for all rent and arrears what&s;oever, and then, after having abu&s;ed his tenant and called him a rogue and a villain &s;everal times, becau&s;e he did not pay the money long before that, thinking it was his own, he mounted his hor&s;e and rode home-wards, the Sheriff having taken another way.</P>
<P>P&mdash;r in di&s;gui&s;e way-laid the landlord on the road, and took all the ca&s;h, with a watch, and &s;ome other things of value, from him; and meet|ing his tenant two or three days afterwards, told him his money was unlucky, for he had lo&s;t it, every penny, and a good deal more with it, on the road, being taken from him by an highway robber, whom he de&s;cribed as well as he could, not remembering ever to have &s;een him. In le&s;s than a week, P&mdash;r called at the farmer's hou&s;e dre&s;&s;ed as he was at fir&s;t, in order to &s;ee how he fared. The farmer told him the whole &s;tory, and how that his landlord was robbed (which he was little &s;orry for) on the road. He entertain|ed P&mdash;r very hand&s;omely that night (not mi&s;tru&s;ting that he was the robber) and gave him a thou&s;and thanks for the u&s;e of his money, pro|mi&s;ing to rai&s;e it for him as &s;oon as he could. P&mdash;r &s;eeing the man's intregrity, de&s;ired him to be under no concern for it; then tearing
<PB N="40" REF="035355_0039_10049CF015CA6650">the note to pieces, bid the farmer adieu.</P>
<P>We have but an imperfect account of the re&s;t of the actions of his life. However, by all re|ports, he was very generous to the poor, and of|ten told the rich that he took their pur&s;es to make a di&s;tribution among &s;uch as were in want. He was at la&s;t betrayed, for a &s;mall reward by his brother's &s;ervant maid, who &s;eeming to be his friend, &s;at drinking with him at an alchou&s;e near Cork, 'till the got an opportunity of pouring wa|ter into the pans of his blunderbu&s;s and pi&s;tols, and then &s;ent privately for the guards, who &s;urroun|ded the hou&s;e and made him apri&s;oner. He was taken to Cork bound, and being there tried and found guilty, was according executed, much about the time that Redmond O'H&mdash;n came fir&s;t in vogue. He was only dubbed a captain, by rea|&s;on of his exploits, by the re&s;t of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of execution, he gave a very kind caution to all young men, de&s;iring them to &s;hun the company of lewd women. It was by giving him&s;elf too much indulgence with &s;uch cattle that he was prevented from accepting his pardon when offered, which at la&s;t brought him to that ignominious death. By woman (&s;aid he) was I enticed to continue in &s;in, and by a woman was I at la&s;t betrayed, tho' &s;he pretended to be my friend. Which &s;peech melted the &s;pectators into tears.</P>

<P>I Could never learn certainly where John Macpher&s;on was born; but his parents were not &s;o poor but they were able to bequeath him a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty little income at their death. He was then about nineteen years of age when the effects came into his hands, which he made a &s;hift to &s;pend in the company of lewd women and game|&s;ters in le&s;s than three years, in which time he was always a leading man at hurling, patterns, and matches of football, and acquired &s;uch fame by his wondrous activity, that no &s;tagie per&s;on dared to oppo&s;e him at any exerci&s;e. He was accounted in his time the &s;tronge&s;t man in the nation; he would hold an hundred weight at arms length in one hand, and would make little or no|thing of twi&s;ting a new hor&s;e-&s;hoe round like a gad; yet notwith&s;tanding all his activity, he was &s;oon reduced to poverty, and &s;o, from one &s;tep after another, brought to the gallows. Want of precaution and care in the beginning, often lays men under difficulties they can never &s;ur|mount; and men that are bred up in luxury and idlene&s;s, &s;eldom &s;ettle them&s;elves rightly to bu&s;i|ne&s;s after. Nothing is more commendable in youth than indu&s;try, 'tis the bulwark and pre&s;er|vation of common wealths, and the &s;upport of private per&s;ons and families.

This Macpher&s;on, when he had &s;old his little income, and &s;pent what he had, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking for a livelihood &s;ome how. He was a &s;tranger to work, and it was beneath him to beg, neither could he brook to rely on the courte&s;y of his friends, who (as it u&s;ually falls out in &s;uch ca&s;es) began to look very &s;hy upon him.</P>
<P>Upon this he began to think of a new way of living, and having provided him&s;elf with &s;ome weapons and a very good &s;taff, he betook him&s;elf to the high road, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enough from his native place not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be known. In his fir&s;t attempts when he came up with any one he knew had money, he fir&s;t reque&s;ted of them to lend him &s;ome, and if by terror or per&s;ua&s;ion he could prevail on them &s;o to do, he would be pretty moderate, and com|monly took but a part; but, on re&s;i&s;tance, he made little or nothing of taking a man by the arm and pulling him off his hor&s;e; he then u&s;ually would give him a pretty hearty &s;queeze, which &s;eldom failed to bring him into compliance, and to deliver without further trouble; yet if a man &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill continued &s;turdy, his cu&s;tom was to throw him over his &s;houlders, and run away with him to &s;ome private p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, and there rifle him: what become of his hor&s;e he mattered not.</P>

<P>For having made a combination with three o|ther rogues, they broke into a gentleman's hou&s;e at Frentwood in E&s;&s;ex, and binding all the people, took away four diamond rings, a great quantity of plate, and about 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in money; this was the fir&s;t attempt, and tho' he had but three to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, they overpowered no le&s;s than ten men and boys, without making the lea&s;t di&s;turbance, and tied them every one in &s;uch a manner that one could not relieve another: by which means Teague and his gang had &s;ufficient time to make off.</P>
<P>After this Macquire, with one a&s;&s;i&s;tant, broke into chancellor Jeffreys's hou&s;e at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and &s;tole the pur&s;e and mace, which he made his comrade carry on his &s;houlder thro' the park to the hou&s;e where they lodged, and then locked them up in a clo&s;et; but &s;ome of the jewels that were in the pur&s;e happened to fall out in the chamber, and Macquire, being gone into the

<HEAD>The Life of Richard Balf, a mo&s;t notorious Mur|derer and Highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>THE reputed father of Richard Balf, was a pedler, tho' but of &s;mall account, who with his wife, was accu&s;tomed to travel to fairs and markets up and down the country, on pretence of getting bread; but, as the &s;tory goes, having learn|ed all the artifice of canting, they got more by begging and cheating than by fair dealing; and at length by thieving and robbing, made a &s;hift to obtain the favour of a hempen necklace, which ea&s;ed them of their care, and was admini&s;tered to them by their &s;on Dick, for robbing and murder|ing in the manner following. Having ca&s;t their eyes upon a lone hou&s;e in the country, wherein it was reported the owner kept a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, they had an itching de&s;ire to be at it; and accordingly one night having laid their &s;cheme, (with their &s;on Dick, not above fifteen years of age, and one more, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them) they entered the hou&s;e by &s;ome &s;tratagem, and the family being fa&s;t a&s;leep, they thought it the &s;af|e&s;t way to di&s;patch them; &s;o beginning with the &s;ervant maids, they cut both their throats with a knife, then going to the &s;ervant-man, and &s;erved him the &s;ame way, al&s;o three children, who lay in a room adjoining; la&s;tly, proceeding to the a|partment where the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s lay, they thought it would be convenient to make them

When they had gathered all the booty they could find in the hou&s;e they marched off; but as it common|ly happens, that murder is found out by one means or other, &s;o this was happily di&s;covered by the mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">derers di&s;agreeing among them&s;elves about the dividing the &s;poil.</P>
<P>Dick and his parents were all taken up and put into pri&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ied and convicted of murder; but &s;o it fell out, that the judge taking compa&s;&s;ion of the boy's youth, and as no hangman was to be had, the &s;on was granted his pardon to account of executing his father and mother.

<P>Dick having &s;een the exit of his parents, was very much di&s;couraged, for a while, from follow|ing their practices, and propo&s;ed going to &s;ervice for an hone&s;t livelihood; but no body being wil|ling to receive him on account of their exaltati|on, and time having worn out the good impre&s;&s;i|ons that were made on his mind by their ca&s;e, what was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppear e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce

B&mdash;f, &s;eeing him&s;elf outwitted, could not tell what to do, 'till ob&s;erving there was a new bed|ead in the room but newly corded, he cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e

Before the words were well out of his mouth, they ran away helter &s;kelt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and left all the booty, both money and plate, be|hind them; but Dick had the wit to &s;tay, and &s;e|cure it for his own u&s;e, and would never give any part thereof to his comrades.</P>
<P>When he had got &s;o much in&s;ight and expe|rience in this bu&s;ine&s;s as to make him&s;elf a com|pleat ma&s;ter, he goes next into a crew of Wool-combers, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;nach hats, cloaks, wigs, and women's handherchiefs, &amp;c. off in the night; but at length being taken in the fact at Galway, by a gentleman who pur&s;ued and over|took him with a &s;word drawn in his hand, he was committed to goal and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rned in the hand for the &s;ame offence.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s not an&s;wering his purpo&s;e, he took a re&s;olution to commence high-way robber; but being a little at a lo&s;s for a good n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g to mount him&s;elf on, he contrived to get one in this manner: He ob&s;erved there was a neighbour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is land|lord's in Galway that had a very well bred geld|ing of a good &s;ize, very fit for his purpo&s;e, and that there was no ob&s;tacle to hinder him from &s;tealing it but the &s;table door, which was &s;till kept locked; to remove this difficulty, he went
<PB N="57" REF="035355_0056_10049D1E1347E9C0">to an old comrade of his whom he knew to be an expert pick-lock, and agreed with him to open the &s;table door, the next night at an hour that was fixed. A heavy &s;hower of rain favouring B&mdash;f's de&s;ign, be carried with him four old coar&s;e &s;tock|ings, and put a little hay in the feet of them, drew them on the hor&s;e, and led him &s;addled, and bridled thro' the gate way, without making any noi&s;e. As &s;oon as he had got the hor&s;e in|to the &s;treet (without &s;taying to take off the &s;tocking which he thought would be &s;oon torn off with riding, in which he gue&s;&s;ed right) he mounted and made off, without taking leave of any body, having taken care to provide him&s;elf with a good ca&s;e of pi&s;tols and a cutla&s;s, before|hand; but never thought proper after to enquire what time the owner mi&s;&s;ed his hor&s;e, or what &s;earch he made after him.</P>
<P>Thus accoutred, and well mounted on a good nag, he rode all night 'till he came to the hou&s;e of one of his acquaintance, near Athlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, where he lay concealed with his hor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 'till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ext, re|&s;olving not to make a public appearance 'till he got a good di&s;tance from Galway.</P>
<P>He then moved to the north and began his new trade of 'Stand, and deliver,' as is u&s;ual with men of his rank, and had &s;uch wonderful &s;uc|ce&s;s in his e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terprizes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">bbing pa&s;&s;engers on the road, that above fifty travellers had been com|pelled to deliver him their pur&s;es of con&s;iderable value, in &s;ix mouths time, which made the people &s;o timorous, that they carried no money about them, except travelling charges: by which means Dick often m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with di&s;appointments, which

<P>Such di&s;appointments made him think it nece&s;|&s;ary to change his quarter, for a while; and ac|cordingly, having fixed his place of rende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vous, he &s;coured the other three provinces with the like &s;ucce&s;s, and thought the whole nation &s;carce|ly large enough to furni&s;h him with occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">; and like death, never took any denial 'till he was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>One day, as he was hunting in que&s;t of his game, he met the earl of D&mdash;l, between Bally|&s;hannon and Sligo, in his coach, and made his &s;ervants pri&s;oners, and rode up to the earl, expec|ting large booty; but finding he had no more than 150 guineas about him, B&mdash;f was very much di&s;&s;atisfied at it, and ordered him to draw a bill of 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> on a certain gold&s;mith in Dublin, to ran|&s;ome his coach hor&s;es from being killed. As &s;oon as Dick received the bill, (leaving the &s;ervants ti|ed) he cut the harne&s;s, and made what &s;peed he could to Dublin, where he received value for the note without being apprehended.</P>
<P>He was &s;o notorious for robbing on the mount of Barrimore, that a guard-hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lt by or|der of the government in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tle of it, to &s;e|cure pa&s;&s;engers from being robbed by him; which was continually &s;upplied with a company of &s;ol|diers, either from Londonderry, Cole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain, or Bel|fa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

<P>Not for this action alone, but for &s;everal full as bold and daring, B&mdash;f by this time was be|come &s;o notorious that a reward of 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> from the government, by proclamation was offered for the taking him: This encouraged &s;everal people to join them&s;elves in parties to go in que&s;t of him: but be being timely informed of it, employed &s;ome &s;pies whom he kept in fee, to give him al|ways notice before hand of their coming out. Accordingly one morning, as he &s;at by the &s;ire in one of his hou&s;es or rendezvous, he had notice that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e men were in pur&s;uit of him, and that they were very near, intending to &s;earch that

B&mdash;f, not knowing which road was &s;afe&s;t to take, was ro&s;olved once to &s;tand and &s;ight for his life, but withal not without having recour&s;e to &s;ome &s;tratagem. Then having exchanged coats with the man of the hou&s;e, who was his confidant, he ordered him to go out at a back win|dow, and hide him&s;elf in a barn behind the hou&s;e, ju&s;t as the men came before the door. The fel|low acted his part &s;o well, that they &s;aw him go thro' the window, and likewi&s;e in at the barn door, when he took care to hide him&s;elf effectually by going under &s;ome &s;traw where there was a communication made under ground between the hou&s;e and the barn: in the mean while, Dick was &s;o well fixed in his fortification, that he might have &s;hot ten men without any harm.</P>
<P>When the pur&s;uers &s;aw the man, whom they took for B&mdash;f, enter the barn, they went di|rectly to it, &s;etting a guard at the door, whil&s;t the re&s;t examined the out&s;ide for fear he &s;hould e&s;cape at any window or private hole: but finding no &s;uch place they all came to the door, re&s;olved on a thorough &s;earch. When they had &s;earched on a long time to no purpo&s;e, they began to move a great heap of &s;traw from one end of the barn to the other, big with hopes of finding what they came for, leaving only two at the door.

<P>After this he began to be more and more afraid of &s;taying in his own country; &s;o &s;tying to Do|naghadee, a &s;ea-port town in the north of Ireland, he took &s;hipping, and landed at Port-Patrick in Scotland; where meeting with an hand&s;ome agreeable landlady, he picked up acquaintance with her, which gave occa&s;ion to her hu&s;band to be jealous, who in revenge, under&s;tanding well enough what he was, cau&s;ed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be &s;eized and &s;ent over to Ireland again; He was brought pi|nioned through all the country to Dublin, com|mitted there to Newgate, and &s;hortly after was tried and condemned.

<P>JOHN MULHONI was born in Connaught; but our author (not being willing to expo&s;e his family, which on his mother's &s;ide was of &s;ome repute) has concealed both his parents and the place of his birth.

Being out of employment in London he &s;oon found out ways of exonera|ting his pockets of the pay he had received for his &s;ervice, and returned into Ireland to vi&s;it his friends, in a very mean condition, which gave them a &s;u&s;picion of his ill management, and cau&s;ed them to take but little notice of him. Di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;uch treatment, he &s;ought new company, and &s;oon became acquainted with one Cahoon, a game|&s;ter, and perhaps not much richer than him&s;elf, who furni&s;hed him with materials for the high|way;

<P>It was cu&s;tomary with them when they met a chair conveniently with any one in it, for two of them to &s;top the men that carried it, while the third robbed the gentleman; but when they made an attack on a coach with but one &s;ervant be|hind, one was ordered to each &s;ide, and to have an eye on the footman, whi&s;e the third &s;topped the driver till the &s;eat was performed. After this manner they robbed a Scotch gentleman, whom they had ob&s;erved to receive a &s;um of mo|ney in gold, from a banker near Hungerford mar|ket; and after that a lady in a chair within three or four doors of her own hou&s;e in Park place as &s;he was returning from paying the counte&s;s of Wal&s;ingham a vi&s;it in St. James's palace, from

<P>The &s;ixth adventure was at Marybone in Au|gu&s;t, 1721, where ob&s;erving that a baronet with one &s;ervant attending him had received a large pur&s;e of gold, they dogged him on his way home to a field, near the bordered hou&s;e, and took above 200 guineas from him, with &s;ome &s;ilver, a dia|mond ring and a watch, then giving the &s;ilver to his man, they padded the hoof and made their e|cape: However the gentleman adverti&s;ed the robbery, offering a larger reward for the watch (in the news papers.) than it could be &s;old for; upon which they &s;ent it privately to the place appointed for receiving it, and got the reward, without being a&s;ked any que&s;tions.</P>
<P>The next robbery they committed was in De|cember following (and as they fully propo&s;ed &s;hould be their la&s;t) when having moved their quarters nearer to Convent-Garden, in order to be le&s;s remote from the gambling tables, in and about the little Piazza, Bow-&s;treet, Charles-&s;treet, and

Nor has it been more apparently verified in the life of any per&s;on than in his, for at the age afore&s;aid, being prompted by his natural inclinations to ride one three years old colt, he per&s;uaded a man, to put him on his back, tho' he had nothing but a collar on his head; but not being any way capable of managing the young bea&s;t, he ran headlong' with him into the Barrow, and &s;wam it, tho' there was a very high flood, and the &s;tream rapid: He held his grip by the mane very well till he got to the further &s;ide, but &s;triving to land at a bad place, the bank broke under the bea&s;t's brea&s;t, and &s;unk with it under water for a moment, and poor Charles was wa&s;hed off with the current, which carried them both down the river near 50 yards, till the colt found footing, and plunged out; yet he held a fa&s;t grip of the collar till he got on dry ground, tho' he was &s;hortly after taken up for dead, and with &s;ome difficulty recovered. After this he u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, in Iri&s;h, he would not fear drowning if he were to &s;ail in a turf ki&s;h, nei|ther was he afterwards any thing afraid of the Barrow water, for he made &s;everal dangerous adventures acro&s;s to e&s;cape the hands of his pur|&s;uers.</P>
<P>As he grew more cautious of pilfering publick|ly than when he was young (not that he thought it any &s;in, but in dread of the law) he managed his affairs &s;o cunningly as to lay the facts always on others, becau&s;e he had an inveterate hatred to
<PB N="79" REF="035355_0078_10049D99AA03DFE8">the gallows and the court-hou&s;e after Sir Toby's death.</P>
<P>From a child he had an ill-favoured a&s;pect, and in his countenance betrayed a deceitful heart, that is, he always carried a rogue's face, tho' his brother Daniel was a hand&s;ome portly man, and of &s;eemly behaviour. His Engli&s;h was but broken at be&s;t, and &s;ometimes he pretended to none at all, as will appear by the &s;equel: And as the &s;aying is, Save a thief from the gallows and he'll cut your throut, &s;o it was with him; for his ingratitude was &s;o great, and he had &s;o tit|tle fidelity, that he made no &s;cruple of accu&s;ing his neare&s;t relations, or even his landlord, nay per&s;ons no ways guilty or concerned, to &s;ave him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the age of twelve years he began to prac|ti&s;e the art of decoying and catching hor&s;es, in which he acquired &s;o much &s;kill, that he made no difficulty of laying hands on the wilde&s;t colt, and hor&s;es that had been handled, &s;eemed to fall into his clutches of their own accord. Perhaps &s;ome reader would expect that I &s;hould give a particular account of his management in this af|fair, but as our intent in publi&s;hing this hi&s;tory, is only to put hone&s;t people on their guard again&s;t robbers and rogues, it can be no way nece&s;&s;ary, neither it expedient to teach a thief how to catch a hor&s;e, or to &s;teal: If I can &s;hew an hone&s;t man how to outwit a rogue, or put a trick on him, 'tis as much as can be expected; and verily that was my chief de&s;ign in publi&s;hing this book.</P>
<P>But it fame be true, it will be entirely need|le&s;s to mentionany particulars: the country peo|ple
<PB N="80" REF="035355_0079_10049D9B6B306968">will have and family do believe it was by a kind of witchara&s;t, or charm, that he decoyed and entrapped hor&s;es, and taught others to do &s;o; and the affirm that he received this charm from a witch in the county of Monaghan, (with whom he was very intimate) for &s;ome &s;ingular &s;ervices he had done her. However, the following relation will make it &s;eem probable that his father before him had the like charm; for which rea&s;on, I'm more than half inclined to di&s;&s;ent from the vul|gar opinion, and conclude, that this magic was in|herent in the family, and runs in the blood.</P>
<P>The &s;tory was related by a gentleman thus:</P>
<P>"In the beginning of queen Ann's reign, I went to &s;ee a friend of mine near Abbeleix, and having arrived at the place, I walked about the fields in the evening alone, and when I came near to the bog, I found I had occa&s;ion to ea&s;e na|ture; I cho&s;e a convenient place under a hedge for that purpo&s;e, but before I had fini&s;hed the di&s;charge of my office, there appeared thro' the hedge a man before me, driving &s;ome hor&s;es ve|ry quietly into a corner, one whereof he took hold of him by the near foreleg, and held him fa&s;t 'till he threw a &s;hert rope about his neck, then he vaulted on him with more agility than ever I &s;aw a miller do on his &s;acks: In this po&s;ture with a long &s;tick in his hand, he drove the colt (he was never handled before) acro&s;s the bog, till he got out of my &s;ight, plunging and leaping to &s;uch a degree all the way, that one would have thought if the old boy were on his back he had but a dull chance from coming off without a broken neck; and by the noi&s;e they made, I conjectured they
<PB N="81" REF="035355_0080_10049D9FF3D0D0F8">might have gone a mile at the &s;ame rate before I left the place. I had no notion of rapparees being out at this time, and thought it might be &s;ome one that owned the colt that had made &s;o free with him, till returning to my friends, I told the &s;tory and then they all &s;u&s;pected, as it really was, from the manner of catching the colt, that old Demp&s;y (tho he had been quiet a long time) had come to pay them a vi&s;it." Thus the gentleman ended his &s;tory, and now to preceed to Charles.</P>
<P>His fo&s;ter father was a tenant under Major P&mdash;t, who once as he was riding out to take a review of his land, took notice of young Charles's activity in riding hor&s;es; upon which he had him &s;ent home, to him, in order to be an attendant on his groom, and to learn him to &s;peak Engli&s;h; where he behaved tolerable well and mode&s;t for a month or two and then he began his waggi&s;h tricks. "The groom and another &s;ervant happen|ing to have &s;ome difference between them&s;elves, Charles was re&s;olved to wind it up to the highe&s;t, and bring a battle about if po&s;&s;ible: they had of|ten been jarring and &s;paring; and as the groom lay in a room under a hay loft, thro' which there was a private hole wide enough for a man to pa&s;s through, the young rogue took an oppor|tunity, in the groom's ab&s;ence, to drop a large &s;ur-reverence at the foot of his bed, not forgetting to be&s;prinkle it a little. When the groom was going to make his bed, what &s;hould he lay his hand fir&s;t upon but the t&mdash;, which all bedaubed him, and threw him into &s;uch a fit of anger, that he vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved to be revenged of his fellow &s;ervant in
<PB N="82" REF="035355_0081_10049DA18AED0AF8">the morning, whom he &s;u&s;pected and nobody el&s;e. He went not to bed that night, but &s;at up, and as &s;oon as the ma&s;ter came out the next day, made his complaint to him. His ma&s;ter could hardly forbear &s;miling at the joke, tho' it was a dirty one; yet he &s;hewed a very great re&s;ent|ment to the other &s;ervant who was accu&s;ed, tho' the fellow who was innocent, utterly denied that he knew any thing of the matter. All this gave the groom no &s;atisfaction, but to logger|heads he would and did go with the other, who proving too hard for him, the groom was wor&s;ted and obliged to give out; then the other, and all that took his part reported that the groom had S&mdash;t his own bed and that he laid it on ano|ther with no other view than to excu&s;e him&s;elf; which getting wind, he was &s;o jeered about it, that he had no quietne&s;s, till he quitted his &s;er|vice and went away.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal young gentlewomen in the hou&s;e, who were very glad of the groom's depar|ture, becau&s;e he was very ready in making com|plaints again&s;t them&s;elves to the old gentleman; from thence Charles took occa&s;ion to let the young ladies into the &s;ecret, who approving of his management, employed him in &s;everal little affairs and about me&s;&s;ages not proper to mention here. But it happened once in the fruit rea&s;on, that the young gentlewomen had a great de&s;ire for &s;ome choice fruit out of the orchard, into which they were refu&s;ed admittance by the ma|jor; upon this they employed Charles to rob the orchard, who getting up very early by break of day, the next morning and without &s;taying to
<PB N="83" REF="035355_0082_10049DA37B530300">put on his breeches, crept thro' a hole in the roof of the privy-hou&s;e, adjoining the orchard, and went to pillaging the trees, where he filled a large chequer apron, with the choice&s;t fruit, and was making ready to return. There was a cler|gyman that lodged in the hou&s;e, who had got a touch of the country di&s;ea&s;e and was &s;omewhat very much out of order, and having occa&s;ion to give &s;peedy vent, had repared to the coffee hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e while the boy was on his expe|dition. As the gentleman &s;at on his &s;eat, and was &s;tooping forward, the boy came to the hole, where, without looking before him as he was de|&s;cending, the apron untied, and all the fruit came tumbling down about his ears; and at the &s;ame moment Charles fell with his legs on each &s;ide of the clergyman's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">k, and by the weight of the fall, threw him on his face, in this po&s;ture they lay wedged together in a nook, for near the &s;pace of a minute, before Charles could di&s;engage him|&s;elf; and the clergyman's &s;urpri&s;e being height|ened more and more upon feeling nothing but naked &s;kin about him he fainted quite away; and lay-&s;till on the ground; the boy thinking he had killed the gentleman, ran away with all &s;peed, and came back no more to his &s;ervice: But the cler|gyman who could not &s;ee him, and was as much terrified as the boy, (without &s;u&s;pecting him in the lea&s;t) went in and told the &s;tory: &s;ome pitied him, others could hardly forbear &s;miling; but nobody could find out the truth, but the boy be|ing mi&s;&s;ing two or three days, and the young gentlewomen knowing the apron that was left be|hind, called to mind the exploit they &s;ent him a|bout,
<PB N="84" REF="035355_0083_10049DA51374E948">and &s;o conjectured that it could be none el&s;e but young Demp&s;ey, who had affrighted the poor clergyman into a &s;it.</P>
<P>In days of his youth there was a miller, at the wind mill near Ballybritas, a fellow very fit for his purpo&s;e with whom he had picked an ac|quaintance. Charles had often been tampering with him to come into his mea&s;ures; but the fel|low had imbibed &s;uch &s;trange notions of a Judge, that he thought he mu&s;t be &s;omething more than mortal, to decide and give judgment on criminal cau&s;es; Nay, he imagined the Judge knew the truth of every complaint that was brought be|fore him, before he heard it; for which rea&s;on, he was afraid of entering into any affair that might bring him before one, 'till he was fully informed what kind of a thing a Judge is. Charles to remove the&s;e &s;cruples, prevailed on the fellow, who was very de&s;irous of knowing, to go along with him to Mary borough a&s;&s;izes, where they heard &s;ome cau&s;es tried; which &s;atisfied the mil|ler's curio&s;ity &s;o far, that he told Cahier, as they were returning home, that a Judge was like one of them&s;elves, and nothing el&s;e but a man, and that he would be nothing afraid of entering in the li&s;ts with Charles as &s;oon as he plea&s;ed; ac|cordingly the fellow was enli&s;ted and put into employment by his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>By this time Charles had picked up acquain|tance in mo&s;t parts of the kingdom for putting his de&s;igns into execution. He fixed five or &s;ix of his own relations in Upper Ormond and O&s;&s;o|ry, and as many in the counties of Leitrim, monag|han, and Derry, be&s;ides a va&s;t number of receivers
<PB N="85" REF="035355_0084_10049DAA213AC278">and a&s;&s;i&s;tants in almo&s;t every hole and corner in the country; &s;o that nothing went ami&s;s with him. He had likewi&s;e never le&s;s than four ap|prentices at a time, who were always bound for the term of &s;even years and paid a pretty round &s;um of money for learning his art and my&s;tery, in which he had &s;uch great &s;kill, that boys were &s;ent to him all the way from the county of Kerry, to be bound. Perhaps he was the fir&s;t Iri&s;h rogue that ever thought of &s;uch a &s;tratagem; for had he taken a thou&s;and pounds for teaching a boy to catch or disfigure a hor&s;e or cow only, I que&s;tion whether he could be hanged by our laws for it; and by the &s;equel, we may ob&s;erve that he always acted in &s;uch a manner as to be capa|ble of evading the force of the law, if po&s;&s;ible, though he was as great a rogue as has been hanged.</P>
<P>He had be&s;ides his Satyrs, receivers and ap|prentices, a number of &s;pies and &s;etters, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s only was to make ob&s;ervations, and give no|tice what cattle (and where they) might be mo&s;t &s;afely conveyed away; and the&s;e had no commu|nication with the Satyrs or drivers them&s;elves. Whenever &s;uch notice was given to Charles, an expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched to &s;ome one or more of the Satyrs, with a de&s;cription of &s;uch bea&s;t or bea&s;ts, which, without any more words, was &s;ufficient to be under&s;tood. By &s;uch means as this the downright thievery could never be pro|ved on Charles, tho' every body knew that he was receiver general, and that his &s;ervants were all paid by the piece, &s;o much a bea&s;t for officiating;
<PB N="86" REF="035355_0085_10049DABB7F9B640">but how Daniel kept his accounts is a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>He had private places for hiding &s;tolen cattle of all kinds in; and at any time when he thought proper, would order &s;uch hor&s;es as came from Lein&s;ter &s;ide or Mun&s;ter, down to his corre&s;pon|dents in the North, who either would &s;end them from Derry, Newry, on Donaghadee to Scotland, or otherwi&s;e &s;wap them off in fairs or &s;ell them. Such hor&s;es, as his corre&s;pondents got in exchange, they made no &s;cruple of &s;elling publickly becau&s;e they could prove the getting of them; but tho&s;e that were &s;tolen in the North were commonly &s;ent to different hands, and were di&s;po&s;ed of in Upper Ormond, O&s;&s;ory, or in Mun&s;ter. To &s;a|tisfy the reader's curio&s;ity, I &s;hall rehear&s;e one &s;tory, being part of the confe&s;&s;ion of one of the confederates while he lay in confinement, before he was executed in Kilkenny, which will give a more particular account of his management than the foregoing.</P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;ed to the people who came to &s;ee him, that one of Charles's &s;etters come to him by night where he lived, and told him there were three hor&s;es in a park near Clonegal; one was black, with a &s;tar and one white foot, another a bay gelding, that padded, and the third, a white pad, with his mane and tail cut clo&s;e. He &s;aid he under&s;tood the me&s;&s;enger's meaning very well and accordingly conveyed the three hor&s;es down to Glenmalier in two nights after. After that he was pitched upon as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on for di&s;po&s;ing of them, and pur&s;uant to his orders took them down to the country of Monagham but as the white hor&s;e was &s;o very remarkable
<PB N="87" REF="035355_0086_10049E9F1B77C4D0">they &s;tained him all over with a fle&s;h coloured red, in order to di&s;gui&s;e him, which was done with Brazilet and allum boiled in water; but that co|lour was &s;oon wa&s;hed off. This fellow was not &s;o much as known in that country; &s;o by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of his Brother receivers, he put off the three hor&s;e in a fair, being all &s;ightly cattle to good advantage, for two of them he got twenty pounds, and for the third a mare, that was afterwards &s;old in the county of Waterford for &s;ix pounds. Some after the owner of the bay-hor&s;e was directed to Charles, in expectation of getting &s;ome tidings of his brea&s;t: but Cahier would not undertake the inquiry, till he was paid two guineas in hand; upon which he pro|mi&s;ed to &s;earch for the hor&s;e. In about twelve days after the hor&s;e was taken out of a &s;tone park in the night, where the la&s;t purcha&s;er kept him and &s;o conveyed down to Charles, who gave the right owner notice that they might find &s;uch a hor&s;e in the wood near the river Barrow; upon which the owner &s;ent his &s;ervant for him, and had him brought home without any compliments. Some time after, the owner was riding to the North to buy linen, and having his hor&s;e with him, he was challenged and &s;ecured till the a&s;&s;izes; but the owner bringing &s;ufficient evidence that he bred him, and that he had been mi&s;&s;ing all the while the other had him, got the better of the di&s;pute, and took his hor&s;e home again. On the other hand, the purcha&s;er could only prove, that he bought him in a fair, but could not tell from whom; &s;o by that means the thief was &s;el|dom &s;ound.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="035355_0087_10049EA0B4C08058">
By what has been related one may perceive how cunningly his affairs were carried on; and in the next place, I &s;hall relate &s;ome of his own actions.</P>
<P>There was an elderly gentleman in the King's County who had a particular humour of his own in &s;everal re&s;pects, and when he took a fancy to any thing was commonly &s;o choice of it, that he would &s;uffer no one el&s;e to u&s;e it. He had a dun hor&s;e of great &s;pirit, and a good hunter; which he was &s;o choice of, that he would not &s;uffer his &s;on to ride him. The &s;on knew the goodne&s;s of the hor&s;e as well as the father, and had ca&s;t a covetous eye upon him, but could not tell how to compa&s;s his de&s;ire till he had advi&s;ed with Cahier, who gave him proper directions. In con&s;ideration of a hand&s;ome fee, Charles, pro|vided him with the &s;kin of a hor&s;e of the &s;ame colour, and with the like marks of his father's hor&s;e, which was then at gra&s;s. This &s;kin was dipt in a bog-hole and pre&s;ented to the father by one of his tenants, as the &s;kin of his gelding, which, they &s;aid, was drowned in a bog-hole.&mdash; The old man, who had not all the wit in the world, nor any mi&s;tru&s;t of the fraud believed his tenant's report, and took it for a matter of fact. However &s;ome time after the &s;on, who had kept the hor&s;e concealed, rode on him home, pretended he had bought him in a fair; as &s;oon as his father &s;aw him he cried out, "D&mdash;, I vow to G&mdash;d, only my hor&s;e was drownded, I would take my oath that's he for he's as like as ever I &s;aw any thing in my life," which expre&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed to a &s;terling joke among the gentlemen of the county
<PB N="89" REF="035355_0088_10049EA25236DB68">for a long time afterwards.</P>
<P>Cahier had occa&s;ion once to pay his corre&s;pon+dents in the county of Kilkenny a vi&s;it and to examine how the affairs and accounts &s;tood be|tween them; where, as he was on his march in the evening, he went into a poor widow's hou&s;e, and demanded a drink of milk, upon which &s;he brought him a large drink of butter-milk but di&s;liking it very much, he abu&s;ed her to all in|tents and purpo&s;es, and bid her go for &s;ome of the new milk, which &s;he refu&s;ed, and would not own to have any other than what &s;he brought; then he called her a bitch and a whore, and cur|&s;ed her over and over, withal &s;aying &s;he &s;hould pay for that ill u&s;age: And indeed &s;o &s;he did, for before next morning her two cows being all &s;he had, were &s;tolen from her, neither could &s;he ger any tidings of them after.</P>
<P>Much about this time he was in his prime, and kept a place much like an office of intelligence, where his brother Daniel was regi&s;ter, who kept an account not only of their corre&s;pondents and place of abode, but likewi&s;e how and for what e|very bea&s;t was di&s;po&s;ed of: By this means they were able to an&s;wer &s;uch people as came in pur|&s;uit of cattle: if they were to be had at all, he generally de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">anded a fee in hand, for putting the owner in the way of getting his bea&s;t, which fee was always proportioned according to the bea&s;t's value, or the difficulty that might attend the recovery of it; and if in happened that the bea&s;t could not be procured with any &s;afety, he was to return &s;uch a part of his fee as was agreed
<PB N="90" REF="035355_0089_10049EA3F9206B90">to before hand, which he &s;eldom refu&s;ed. Now we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Cahier never delivered to the owner any bea&s;t that had been &s;tolen; all he did, was to direct him to go where he might find &s;uch a one; and this &s;tratagem was to prevent home proof being given again&s;t him. Neverthe|le&s;s, he had the misfortune to be bit even in this re&s;pect, and catched in &s;uch a trap, that it co&s;t him a &s;ummer's work to get lo&s;e. This was in the year 1729, when the practice was &s;o com|mon of killing &s;heep in the night time, and ta|king away their &s;kins, carca&s;es, and fat, which they di&s;po&s;ed of in di&s;tant places. This practice was carried on mo&s;tly by di&s;carded &s;hepherds (tho' not without Cahier's knowledge) who kept dogs trained &s;it for the purpo&s;e, with other mate|rials.</P>
<P>A gentleman in the country of Kilkenny ha|ving &s;ome cows &s;tolen from him, employed a tru&s;ty &s;ervant to make enquiry from Cahier, who having received his fee, in a &s;hort time gave pro|per directions, as he thought, where to find them. The gentleman managed &s;o crattily, that he took up one of the men in who&s;e cu&s;tody the cattle were &s;ound, and this per&s;on having accu&s;ed Cahier, Ca|hier was taken and put into Naas goal, where on purpo&s;e to &s;ave his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, he turned evidence for the king, and impeached &s;ix or &s;even people in that country. Cahier told the Judges that he could do the country a va&s;t deal of &s;ervice, that he could inform again&s;t rogues in every county in the province, and was willing to do it, to bring them to ju&s;tice. The judges were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty well informed of his capacity of doing &s;o; but not in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g|gining
<PB N="91" REF="035355_0090_10049EAB4E9BAB78">that he was a fore&s;worn rogue, they took him thro' the circuit to Philip&s;town, Marybo|rough, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, and Wick|low, expecting to benefit the country, by rid|ding it of rogues upon this evidence; but Charles took care not to inform again&s;t any one who was &s;taunch to his intere&s;t, impeaching none but &s;uch as he thought might betray him, if tak|en up, or &s;uch as he owed a grudge to, tho' they were innocent, and no way concerned with him. 'Tis true, he was di&s;charged, and &s;lipped his own neck out of the halter by this means, but the country was little the better; for tho' he cau&s;ed four or five to be hanged, 'tis thought that &s;ome of them were not guilty.</P>
<P>Charles has not been long out of confinement before he took a &s;mall concern under a gentle|man near Lea, on which he opened his office again; and as he had accu&s;ed none of his &s;taunch comrades, they had no fault to his charge, but joined him very readily, and carried on their trade as before in conjunction.</P>
<P>However, one of his boys had given him oc|ca&s;ion to be angry on a certain time, for which he banged and abu&s;ed him; the boy being &s;to|mached at this u&s;age, threatened to make &s;ome di&s;covery to his ma&s;ter's prejudice, which to pre|vent, Charles decoyed him into a wood (know|ing that he could neither read not write) and with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bound him fa&s;t, and cut out his tongue; however through mi&s;take, not &s;o clo&s;e, out when he was cured, he made a &s;hift to &s;peak, though very imperf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tly.</P>

At another time, one of his accomplices bro't to him by night, a very &s;imple follow (in appear|ance) from upper Ormond, who came only to get intelligence of two hor&s;es that hadl been &s;to|len from him, and had laid down a gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea for in|formation money.

After he had reprimanded his accomplices for intruding &s;uch a fellow on him without previous notice, the two hor&s;es were &s;ent for, and ready to be delivered again&s;t day-break; then Cahier after he had pli|ed the man with liquor all night, &s;ent for a large &s;ack, and having bound the fellow hand and foot, and gagged him to prevent him f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m making a noi&s;e, he was tumbled into it, and then the va|cancy was well &s;tuffed with hay (only a hole was made for him to breathe thro') to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ake it &s;eem like a &s;ack of corn.</P>
<P>When matters were thus prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, Charles mounted on one of the hor&s;es, and had the &s;ack thrown up before him, which he carried thro' as private paths as he could for about two miles, 'till he got into the high road, and it began to grow pretty light; then pitching upon a proper &s;pot of ground where there was good gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, he took the &s;ack off the hor&s;e, the gag out of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow's mouth, tethered both hor&s;es, and made off him&s;elf. The fellow had no other way left
<PB N="93" REF="035355_0092_10049EAF8E1EAB78">to relieve him&s;elf, than by calling out to pa&s;|&s;engers, which he did very powerfully, but found no relief till about nine o'clock. When he was relea&s;ed, he catched his hor&s;es, and made the be&s;t of his way home, for fear of meeting with a &s;e|cond di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>Charles was &s;hortly after indicted for &s;everal facts, and committed to Mary borough jail, with his comrade Jack; but the Landlord, who per|haps was afraid of lo&s;ing &s;ome arrears, if he lo&s;t his tenant, made &s;uch intere&s;t, and obtained &s;o fair a character of him, that he was acquitted for that time, and his brother al&s;o, though it was very well known that they were pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to the &s;tealing of almo&s;t every hor&s;e that had been &s;to|len in that county.</P>
<P>But &s;ome little time after, the &s;aid landlord to make &s;ure of his rent, &s;eized on Cahier's ef|fects, and turned him off his land. This put him to his wit's end to meditate revenge, which he thought he could bring about no better way than by accu&s;ing him, and bringing him in as a party concerned along with him.</P>
<P>His former landlord had converted a large vault, that lay under an old ca&s;tle, into a &s;table, which was large enough to hold &s;everal hor&s;es; in this &s;table, and in a wood near to it (which &s;ome people &s;ay Charles did only through de&s;ign) Cahier, when he had occa&s;ion, had leave to put &s;ome of his hor&s;es, and this was foundation e|nough for him to ground an accu&s;ation upon: Nay, he made preparations for giving in exami|nations, and the whole country believed that the
<PB N="94" REF="035355_0093_10049EB33AD09460">&s;aid gentleman was one of the managers in the confederacy.</P>
<P>Mr. G&mdash;, the &s;aid gentleman, who was upon &s;etting up for a ju&s;tice, being irritated a|gain&s;t Charles, had examinations given again&s;t him, and after a very difficult pur&s;uit, Cahier was taken and committed to Naas goal, in No|vember, 1734<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where he remained till the March a&s;&s;izes following, from whence he was tran&s;mit|ted to Mary borough, in order to be tried. While he was pur&s;ued, he &s;wam &s;everal times acro&s;s the Barrow, tho' the flood was great, and his &s;aid landlord's men followed him with as much re&s;o|lution, till they took him, in a haggard, where he had concealed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Things being now brought to this &s;ituation, he &s;wore &s;everal examinations in Iri&s;h, while he was in confinement, again&s;t the gentleman and others, to put off his own trial, and told his &s;to|ries &s;o plau&s;ible, that &s;everal gentleman in the country took his part, and the gentleman was tried; and were it not for &s;ome of the leading men in the country, it is to be feared he might have &s;uffered. It was with &s;ome difficulty that his trial was put off till Augu&s;t affixes, tho' Ca|hier was the only evidence again&s;t him. But &s;ome others whom Charles accu&s;ed, were tied up by the neck, particularly one Hickey, who owned that he had often tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, but denied the facts whereof he was then accu&s;ed, at the gallows.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now pa&s;s on to Cahier's trial, at Maryborough, in Augu&s;t, 1735. He was fir&s;t brought to the bar, and then ordered to hold up
<PB N="95" REF="035355_0094_10049EB5E1D70660">his hand, which he did pretty quietly, time after time, 'till above thirty indictments were read again&s;t him: Then the judge &s;aid, 'guilty or not guilty?' but Cahier &s;eemed not to under|&s;tand one word of Engli&s;h, till one behind him bid him in Iri&s;h to an&s;wer: then he turned a|bout, and a&s;ked the other in the &s;ame language, what he &s;hould &s;ay? Why &s;ays he, neel me dheer (i. e. not guilty.) The judge then told him, he would make him &s;ind good Engli&s;h &s;hort|ly; and proceeded on, a&s;king him how he would be tried? but &s;till no Engli&s;h from Charles, who only a&s;ked one that &s;tood by in Iri&s;h, what the judge &s;aid? But the judge was re&s;olved not to be tri&s;ted with; &s;o after much ado, he was taught to &s;ay, "By cod and my guntry.</P>
<P>At length the fir&s;t evidence was produced, and then a &s;econd and a third, &amp;c. but &s;till nothing but Iri&s;h from Demp&s;y, till a fellow from the North came up, who &s;wore very home again&s;t him about a cow: Then all at once, he cried in a pa&s;&s;ion, "That's murder, my lord, he does not know m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at all; he's a lying rogue, for I had that cow wid my &s;helf ever; &s;he was born'd upon my own ground, my broder here knows it" Ah!

<P>His trial la&s;ted above twelve hours; for tho' there were &s;o many evidences again&s;t him, and even the man that had lo&s;t his tongue, yet not above two, without other circum&s;tances, would have hanged him. He &s;poke broken Engli&s;h all along after, and pleaded very artfully, particu|la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly again&s;t the &s;aid gentleman, who was one of
<PB N="96" REF="035355_0095_10049EB7764A8388">the chief evidences again&s;t him. He always con|tradicted him, and &s;till would &s;ay to the judge, "That the evidence was the greate&s;t rogue of the two." But all did not &s;ave him; he receiv|ed &s;entence of death, and was executed in Au|gu&s;t, 1735.</P>
<P>As he pa&s;&s;ed from the gaol to the gallows, he minded nothing but di&s;cour&s;ing with the people, who came to inquire of him about cattle that had been &s;tolen from them. To &s;ome he gave &s;atisfactory an&s;wers, and directed them where to &s;eek; to others, he made none. On the ladder he continued the like di&s;cour&s;e, till he was turn|ed off, and even then, he was &s;o loth to die, that he caught hold of it as it turned, and held fa&s;t, till the &s;heriff obliged him to quit his grip, by pounding his knuckles with the but end of his whip. Thus he went out of the world, without clearing any one that he had accu&s;ed, and died according to the belief of every body, an hard|ened villain.</P>
<P>His brother Daniel, who was found guilty of the like facts, and executed along with him, be|haved in a quite different manner; he continued reading, on his way to the place of execution, very devoutly, in a Manuel, and repeated a great number of prayers before the ladder was turned.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>GOLD FINDER:</HI> Or, the notorious CHEATS of Manus. Mac O'Neil, AND His Man ANDREW.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many remarkable tricks related in the hi&s;tory of the Iri&s;h Rogues, there is none de&s;erves more the attention of the reader, than the following, being managed by an ignorant country fellow, who, by the natu|ral &s;implicity of his look, and an artful affecta|tion of folly, pa&s;&s;ed upon the world as a &s;tupid, innocent bumpkin, incapable of forming the lea&s;t de&s;ign or intrigte, which gave him the advan|tage of carrying on his cheat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ucce&s;sfully for a long time, without being in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected. What province or country he was born in, I could never learn, tho' you may take it for granted, he was a downright Iri&s;hman; for he wore the brogue upon his tongue, as fa&s;hionable as any rogue in the nation.</P>
<P>At the age of &s;ixteen years, or thereabouts, he was bound apprentice to a Ma&s;on, at Clone-bullock,
<PB N="98" REF="035355_0097_10049EBB4DC5DD18">in the King's county; but his ma&s;ter dying before he had time to learn the trade, Ma|nus was put under &s;ome difficulties; however, he made a &s;hift to pick up acquaintance with an expert tinker, who had &s;kill in running down metal; and upon occa&s;ion, was not backward in coining a piece of &s;ilver and gold, to an&s;wer his nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>This &s;ame tinker had been tried for his life, for facts of this kind, both in Naas and Armagh, and found means to get off in both places. The Indictment upon which he was tried in Armagh, was for making and uttering a bad pi&s;tole; where &s;eeming on his trial, to know nothing of the matter, he &s;aid that not above three pi&s;toles had pa&s;&s;ed thro' his hands in his life, and that he could know every one again; at the &s;ame time he begged leave to &s;ee the piece he was charged with for uttering, and if he had pa&s;&s;ed it, he would not deny it; upon this, it was given into his hand to be examined. While he was view|ing the piece, he pretended to bite it, but took an opportunity of drawing another out of his mouth in&s;tead of it, which he &s;aid was the &s;ame piece he had pa&s;&s;ed, and would prove it to be right good gold; accordingly it was tried, and found good, by which &s;tratagem he got clear.</P>
<P>Manus having got a little in&s;ight into the bu|&s;ine&s;s, grew &s;ick of Ma&s;onry and immediately fell upon new &s;chemes. By &s;ome means or other, he procured as much gold as made a &s;mall ingot, which he u&s;ed as a decoy. With this he moved towards Allen, where meeting with a &s;imple ho|ne&s;t Engli&s;h countryman, &s;it enough to &s;erve his

<P>"I was 'prentice, &s;ays he, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Ma&s;on, and at Ea&s;ter when my Ma&s;ter went abroad, he left me&s;elf and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">noder 'prentice to maak a paar of pear, for a gaat at New-abbe), in the county of Kildere, ju&s;t hard by the old buildings: both of us had a mind to maak as good a work while my ma&s;ter wou'd be from us, and better, nor af he'd &s;ten wid us him&s;elf; and I went wid my|&s;helf, and tin wid a crow in my hand, to get &s;ome good &s;tones out of the old walls, that wou'd be fitting for us, tho' it was Ea&s;ter Monday, and the people all at ma&s;s.

Do you know what &s;ort dat is? But what would you have of it? We took em all out of dat, and buried em in anoder plaas, till we got time to look 'em all over, for fear of the lord of the manor; if he hears of it, he'll come and take it from us. You mu&s;t not tell any bo|dy, only if you have any friend who would give us a little monies, he &s;hould have a great bargain, for my &s;helf does not know the wort of &s;uch &s;ort, and may be too af I'll take them to the gold|&s;mith in Dublin, he'll &s;hallenge us wid 'em, and fair may be we'd get nothing for 'em, but go to gaal after.

<P>The Farmer hearing the fellow talk &s;o &s;imply, verily imagined that he was a mere ignoramus, and thought all that he told him was as true as the hearth mouey; however he kept his council as far as proper, and de&s;ired Manus to have his trea&s;ure in readine&s;s, and not to &s;hew it to any body, for fear of lo&s;ing it, till he got an oppor|tunity of acquainting &s;ome of his friends, who, he was &s;ure, had a good deal of money lying by, and would purcha&s;e the whole. Manus's &s;ole in|tention was to make him&s;elf &s;eem as fooli&s;h as
<PB N="101" REF="035355_0100_10049EC4F1E072A8">po&s;&s;ible, thereby to make his bait the more taking, yet he did not confine him&s;elf to hold the &s;ecret from all others; for he told the afore&s;aid &s;tory to as many as he thought he could make proper fools of, to further his de&s;igns, and behaved as much like a fool as po&s;&s;ible, that no &s;u&s;picion of deceit might hereby ari&s;e: for which rea&s;on I &s;hall give him the title of the Iri&s;h fool, let others call him what they plea&s;e. By this arti|&s;ice, the &s;tory was whi&s;pered about very private|ly from hand to hand, among &s;uch people as were &s;uppo&s;ed to have money, who were mo&s;tly intent upon engro&s;&s;ing the trea&s;ure every one to him&s;elf, that for &s;ear of being prevented they even would not give their wives an item of it.</P>
<P>At length, people that had money, came pri|vately from all parts to &s;eek Manus, in hopes of making their fortunes, but in fact it was only to lo&s;e them. The fir&s;t that he made a perfect ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret, was an innkeeper of the county of Kilkenny, who had brought a pretty handful of money with him, and a portmanteau, in order to purcha&s;e a large quantity of gold; but Manus, as great a fool as he pretended to be, was re&s;olved not to be caught in any trap, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ell any of his ware under that denomination, for &s;ear of bringing him&s;elf into trouble, and gave &s;uch rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, that the purcha&s;er &s;eemed to have no mi&s;tru&s;t of a bite. Says he, "I don't &s;ell you my ingots of gold, that would be the way to be found out by the lord of the manor, who has the fir&s;t preten|&s;ion to every &s;ort of that kind that's found in
<PB N="102" REF="035355_0101_10049EC6C653D3C8">his ground any way; and to be &s;ure he'd have the gold above any thing el&s;e. I tell you what I'll do wid you, give me &s;uch monies as will buy tin good cows to maintain my&s;helf, and I'll give you &s;o much of the &s;ort I found in the Old Ab|bey as ever you can carry way wid you in the leather bag behind you; but you mu&s;t give me your oat fir&s;t that you won't open it till you get home, nor tell any body how much gold you have, nor how you got it, and dis is &s;ome of the &s;ort I found (laying his ingot on a brick, and pointing to it with his finger.) Now, how much monies will you give me, and I'll &s;ill your bag?" The bargain was agreed to, and the purcha&s;er &s;worn to &s;ecrecy; then Manus led him in the night to a convenient field for his purpo&s;e, pretending a great deal of fear, le&s;t any one &s;hould &s;ee or hear them; and having blindfolded him, he took the portmanteau a little further, where he filled it with bricks, &s;tones, and hay, and when he had locked it, he returned with the load. The inkeeper was overjoyed at his bargain, and having paid Manus about forty pound, earne&s;t money, he put the load up behind him, and rode home po&s;t ha&s;te, promi&s;ing to pay the remainder on delivery of the key, which the goldfinder was to give him in two days after at his own hou&s;e, where he was to meet him and take an account of his ware. But the inkeeper waited two days, three times told before Manus appeared with the key, and might have waited till doom's day only his impatience prompted him to be fingering the gold; upon which he tipped open the portmanteau, and finding how
<PB N="103" REF="035355_0102_10049EC8EC7FCCC8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nfoundedly he was outwitted, he &s;ell &s;ick of a Plenetick fever, which had like to have co&s;t him his life. However he was &s;o much a&s;hamed of his bargain, that he could not tell how to di|vulge the &s;ecret for &s;ome months after.</P>
<P>The rumour of finding &s;uch immen&s;e trea|&s;ure was &s;pread about with &s;uch artifice, that hundreds were apprized of it yet every man that had money and heard it imagined him&s;elf fir&s;t in the baby-hou&s;e, and &s;trove eagerly to make his market, before others knew any thing of the affair. I heard of a very re&s;pon&s;ible merchant's son in the county of &mdash;, that had ju&s;t receiv|ed a con&s;iderable fortune with his wife, who upon having notice thereof, made preparations for di&s;po&s;ing of all his effects, in order to pur|cha&s;e the whole trea&s;ure, (crown, jewels and all) and to carry them to France, about the time the late French King was married, expecting to make a million of money by the bargain, and to be able at his return to purcha&s;e the whole country before him; but the gay man his father being a man of better experience in the world, &s;u&s;pected &s;ome deceit, and (though with difficul|ty) di&s;&s;uaded his &s;on from engaging in &s;o hazar|dous a project.</P>
<P>Manus had &s;uch good fortune by his &s;chemes, that in a little time he was able to make a new ingot of real gold, which weighed about twelve ounces, in the &s;hape of a &s;mall bar, and this he carried about for a decoy: Be&s;ides he was &s;up|plied by one of his accomplices from Dublin-with bra&s;s bars of the &s;ame &s;ize and form, gilded or covered over &s;o that any per&s;on not well &s;kill+ed
<PB N="104" REF="035355_0103_10049ECFB2986098">in metals might ea&s;ily be deceived, and not know one from the other. He had likewi&s;e the luck to pick up an acquaintance with one An|drew Farrel, an ill inclined young fellow, who&s;e u&s;ual employment was to carry meat from the butchers in Dublin to gentlemen in the country. He pre&s;ently found that this fellow would be ve|ry fit for his purpo&s;e, ina&s;much as that he was intimate with &s;everal people of good credit in Dublin, and &s;o he let them into the &s;ecret. This Farrell told his &s;tory concerning the trea&s;ure with &s;uch a &s;eeming probality, that numbers en|tertained him, and treated him with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">undance of court&s;ev, in order to get him to introduce them to Manus; however he always enjoined them to &s;ecrecy, &s;till pretending the greate&s;t friend&s;hip imaginable to tho&s;e he told it to, by which means he drew great numbers in &s;earch of the gold. 'Tis really a wonder, that among &s;o many as came from all parts in que&s;t of this trea|&s;ure, that &s;ome of them did not blab out one to another, what their bu&s;ine&s;s was; but the my&s;|tery lay here, tho&s;e that were in pur&s;uit, kept council of nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;uch as were bit, were under the&s;e obligations, or &s;o much a&s;hamed of their bargains, that they could not tell how to di&s;cover or expo&s;e their weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Their mo&s;t u&s;ual way of impo&s;ing on cu&s;tom|ers, was this; after the buyers had been proper|ly informed of the trea&s;ure, and manner of find|ing it and &s;o wrought up into a firm belief of the certainty thereof, without &s;hewing any token of mi&s;tru&s;t; then Manus began to expo&s;e the gold bar which he call'd bra&s;s, as a &s;ample of his trea|&s;ure,
<PB N="105" REF="035355_0104_10049ED14EC64D88">always prompting his chapmen to try it, let them call it what they plea&s;ed. When they had fully &s;atisfied them&s;elves concerning the value of the metal, a bargain was commonly concluded upon; in the mean while Manus always took care, by one means other, to exchange the gold bar for another of bra&s;s of which &s;ort be could fur|ni&s;h his cu&s;tomers with as many as they thought proper; then as it was cu&s;tomary with him, he de|manded either the money or &s;ufficient earne&s;t, which being laid down on the &s;ide of the table, and the ingits, as he called them on the other, "Now, &s;ays he, here is my ware, it is bra&s;s I call it, and will fold it to you for bra&s;s, and nothing el&s;e, but your&s;elf knows the &s;ort be&s;t.

He frequently appeared to be in liquor, and by the&s;e kind of &s;peeches, which &s;eemed to proceed from perfect ignorance, his cu&s;tomers only became ten times more earne&s;t than before, making no &s;cruple to give an oath of &s;ecrecy, which being done, they &s;eldom made any delay till they got home with the trea&s;ure. But as par|ticular in&s;tances may be more &s;atisfactory, I &s;hall relate two or three, to render him in more plain colours.</P>

<PB N="106" REF="035355_0105_10049ED2E165FCE0">with the &s;aid Farrel, he took a jaunt down to Dublin, with the ingot of real gold in his pocket and &s;everal gits of bra&s;s, as like it as could po&s;|&s;ibly be made. In the habit of a mean country farmer, he went to an eminent banker in Ca&s;tle-&s;treet, and finding him alone, he drew out his in|got, and began to make his condition and ca&s;e known in the mo&s;t moving and pathetic manner.

The banker then would have been very willing to have purcha&s;ed it at &s;o moderate a price, but the other refu&s;ed to &s;ell; end cot only &s;o, but was for borrowing more upon it, and at a longer time than the banker approved

Says he, (giving a &s;igh, with a &s;orrowful countenance, wringing his hands and dropping a few tears) "I mu&s;t &s;ell dis or borrow &s;ome monies upon it, to &s;lop my cattles, I believe you will give me &s;o much as any body for it, and a&s; I don't relea&s;e it again&s;t Chri&s;tmas day I won't a&s;b it any more." The banker then told him out what he offered before and a guinea over, thinking him a &s;imple ignorant fellow, and then laid his bargain up in a drawer without examining it, thinking that it was worth about fifteen pounds more at lea&s;t. Some time after Chri&s;tmas the banker had &s;ome compa|ny at dinner with him, to whom he related after what manner he had bought a great bargain of gold from a &s;ill countryman. They were all de|&s;irous of &s;eeing it, and when one of the gentle|men viewed it, he &s;aid it was not gold, upon which the banker held him a bottle of wine to the con|trary, and had it tried over again: but to his mortification was obliged to yield the wager lo&s;t, which put him entirely out of humour, tho' it pro|ved very good diver&s;ion for the re&s;t of the com|pany, to &s;ee a banker outwitted by a fool, who never intended to pay him another vi&s;it.</P>
<P>When he and his man Andrew had pretty well &s;educed and defrauded a great number of the Dublinians out of there money, for ingots of bra&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="035355_0107_10049EDAC8330F60">in&s;tead of gold, they grew enraged again&s;t him and began to dog Andrew to his lodgings, and to the country, thinking to take him before a ju&s;tice; but he ob&s;erving it, gave them the &s;lip, and po&s;ted away to his ma&s;ter, who had retired to the wood of Allen, where he u&s;ually &s;pent the mo&s;t of his time. As &s;oon as Manus under&s;tood that people endeavoured to take him, &s;ays he dar a nagh agus dat a neagh, we will go to Connaught: And their effects being ea&s;ily carried, and affairs &s;ettled, after drinking a belly full of brandy, their common liquor, they began their journey, not in the direct-road, but thro' the Queen's County, where Manus was obliged to make a longer &s;tay than he expected occa&s;ioned by a misfortune that befel him. It happened that while he pa&s;&s;ed thro' this la&s;t county, a man of &s;ome figure purcha&s;ed &s;ome of his ingots of bra&s;s for which he paid Manus a pretty round &s;um of money; in a few days after the gentleman ex|po&s;ed his bargain to a gold&s;mith in Dublin, with a de&s;ign of converting part of it into plate for his family, and to make money of the re&s;t; but to his &s;orrow, being thoroughly made &s;en&s;ible of the fraud, he po&s;ted home, and upon &s;earch, had the good fortune of &s;eizing Manus, whom he got com|mitted to Maryborough goal, where he remain|ed under confinement 'till the next a&s;&s;izes. At length his trial came on, and a vigorous pro&s;ecu|tion was made again&s;t him, and to be &s;ure the ju|ry could have thought no better of him than he de&s;erved, only that when he was a&s;ked what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, he a&s;ked his pro&s;ecutor &s;e|veral crooked que&s;tions, 'till he obliged him to ac|knowledge,
<PB N="109" REF="035355_0108_10049EDF185C05E0">that Manus told him, at the time they made the bargain that his ware was bra&s;s, and no other. 'What would you have din? And is it not bra&s;s? Sure that's no &s;heat for a man to &s;ell his guts by the right name. I will leave it to my lord judge, and the gentlemin of the the jury.' In &s;hort he filled the court with &s;ur|prime and laughter, to &s;ee how artfully he could evade the force of the law, tho in appearance he &s;eemed like a fool: However the jury &s;at upon it, yet they could not bring him in guilty of what he was accu&s;ed; upon which he was acquitted.</P>
<P>Now he thought every hour a day 'till he got into &s;ome remote place, and &s;o ha&s;ted away with his man Andrew to Connaught, where having no acquaintance, they remained under &s;ome difficul|ties before they got into a way of getting a livelihood, and &s;o were under a nece&s;&s;ity of making the former &s;poil of the Dublinians main|tain them (of which they had &s;till a good plenty left, drinking wine and brandy very profu&s;ely) till at la&s;t Andrew got acquainted with one Dominick D&mdash;t, a rich farmer's &s;on, and a &s;harp in&s;inuating youth, who was very intimate with &s;everal gentlemen in that country. It was beneath a man of Emanuel's fortune to &s;eek cu&s;tomers him&s;elf, wherefore Andrew was to manage that point, who thinking this young man would make a &s;it bate for his hook, told him the whole &s;tory concerning the finding of the trea&s;ure, as before related, that for fear of the lord of the manor who heard of it, they fled,
<PB N="110" REF="035355_0109_10049EE14A638BC0">into that country to conceal it, and to be more private. They were over a cup of liquor at this time, and Farrel pretending to be drunk, called the other a&s;ide and &s;poke very privately, de&s;ir|ing him to let no body know but his neare&s;t friends, who on his account only &s;hould get good bargains.</P>
<P>Young D&mdash;t was overjoyed at the news, and returned in to talk to Manus, without delay or, &s;u&s;picion. Manus knowing his inclinations pulled out his ingot of gold. and &s;wore the young man to &s;ecrecy, who was charmed with the beau|ty of the metal; and being very de&s;irous that his friends &s;hould make their fortunes, he brought his uncle to Manus, who told him his u&s;ual &s;tory, (like an ignorant fellow, as he pretended to be) with great artifice and having charged him pretty high with liquor, he got all the man's money, and &s;ent him home with gits in lieu of it; but in &s;ome days having di&s;covered the fraud, he complained to Dominick's father, and poor Dominick was turned out of doors for his pains: this was what Manus wanted in his heart, and as &s;oon as he heard thereof, he returned to Cloncumber, a &s;crubby i&s;land in the bog of Allen &s;urrounded with rivers and quagmire: At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the i&s;land &s;tands a wood, from which to the i&s;land there is a pa&s;&s;age, but then a great part of it is commonly covered with water, and very difficult to find; and on the middle of the i&s;land there is a fort, whereon if a man &s;tands, he may view the country round for &s;ome miles, and &s;ee every body that comes near it. Here he fixed his lodgings, &s;o that when
<PB N="111" REF="035355_0110_10049EE62F2C6698">any that he knew not came on the wood &s;ide, he commonly would take to the bog; but if on the bog &s;ide, to the wood; and here he carried on his game for a long time, never coming out but to make his bargains, and then only in &s;ure com|pany, to &s;uch hou&s;es as he well knew.</P>
<P>Andrew had given an item to Dominick where they intended to go, who being turned out as afore&s;aid, followed them in expectation of get|ting his money returned; but Manus &s;hewed him &s;o many legerdemain tricks that he &s;oon found it was but in vain to expect any &s;uch thing, and &s;o knowing he had no bu&s;ine&s;s home without it, he became a di&s;&s;olute young fellow, and joined his forces along with this new company.</P>
<P>'Tis true he returned to Connaught, but then it was only as a decoy, and to make a prey of others. He brought a collector with him from Eyrecourt, to Cloncumber, whom Mac O'Neil fir&s;t &s;were to keep &s;ecrecy, and then &s;old him &s;ome of his bars at a very good race, only with this liberty, upon his oath that if any one a&s;ked what he had bought, to &s;ay it was bra&s;s; and &s;ays, 'dar a nagh, a dan a negh, I believe it is, for I don't know gold.' But when the collector found out the cheat, he was exa&s;perated and watching an opportunity, had Manus taken up, &s;ent to jail, and trie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>But when the time expired, his chapman com|monly began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome fraud, and of con&s;e|quence would break open the locks, to examine what he had got. One fellow that had made money of all his effects to purcha&s;e his trea&s;ure, upon opening his portmanteau, &s;ound nothing but bricks carefully lapped up in paper. Which exa&s;perated him to &s;uch a degree, that he went back armed in pur&s;uit of Mac O'Neil; but Ma|nus had removed to the i&s;land, as he always did when he expec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed a pur&s;uit, where he might re&s;t &s;ecure enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill he thought proper to appear again; his ab&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding in this manner, made the fellow &s;earch in vain, &s;o that he was obliged to return home with lo&s;s and &s;hame.</P>
<P>Not long after this, a pretty farmer in the county of Limerick hearing that &s;uch a heap of trea&s;ure was to be di&s;po&s;ed of, privately came up with his wife and all the money he could rai&s;e in order to make his for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne for ever.

When he got ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, he put up the trea&s;ure, without &s;hewing it to any body, and &s;old two draft mares he had for about thirty pounds, with which money he went back to Rathangan, in about &s;ixteen days; but when he came to the ale-hou&s;e where he left them, he could find nobody that he knew but his wife, who informed him the Gold-finders were gone to &s;ome i&s;land above three days before, and in|tended to &s;ee him no more; upon &s;ome other words that &s;he, dropt he not only began to &s;mell the cheat, but was &s;o much blinded with a pair of horns that &s;prung out of his forehead that mo|ment, and hung in his eyes, that he &s;pent a month in groping the way home again.</P>
<P>Among other wi&s;e men of Gotham who ex|pected to make their fortune by dealing with Manus, there was one C&mdash;h&mdash;n near Wexford, a great projector, who having received private intelligence of his va&s;t trea&s;ure, rode &s;everal miles to make further enquiry and a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf of the matter; concerning which upon his return, he was &s;o well &s;atisfied, that he im|mediately di&s;po&s;ed of as much ef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cts to be could conveniently &s;pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and then g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thering tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er

It was about Michelmas, (as Manus &s;ays) that this gentleman &s;et out from his hou&s;e on a &s;tout gelding, equipt like a man of honour, with a &s;ilver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilted &s;word, a new &s;uit of cloaths, a fine hat and wig, and &s;ixty pounds in his pocket, with which he po&s;ted directly to Mun&s;tereven, attended only by a &s;ervant.

However, up he got, walked about, and called, and cried, and &s;houted and cur&s;ed, and kicked and danced with vexation, round the hou&s;e, like a madman, till he made him&s;elf &s;o weary, that he was forced to leave off.

<P>The la&s;t &s;tory that I &s;hall be particular in, is, of a certain gentleman, well &s;killed in metal, a &s;harp man, and one that was re&s;olved not to be impo&s;ed on, as he had heard &s;ome others had been.

<P>His &s;on James was brought up by his uncle, and put to &s;chool under a popi&s;h prie&s;t, but he being very unlucky, could never be kept to his book, as he would run away for a month toge|ther, 'till his uncle not knowing what to do with him, determined to &s;end him to England, and let him try his fortune, being certain that the boy had a&s;&s;urance enough to live in any part of the world, and impudence enough to &s;tick at no|thing; yet Jemmy would not be per&s;uaded to travel, unle&s;s his uncle would equip him with a &s;word, a pair of dice, and a pack of cards, with which he thought he could do well enough.</P>
<P>He made the be&s;t of his way to London, but
<PB N="120" REF="035355_0119_10049F178DE1F868">found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in his way to com|mit &s;ome pilfering robberies, for his better &s;up|port, for one of which he was well flogged at Bri&s;tol, and all his uten&s;ils, dice and cards taken from him; when not knowing what to do, he had &s;ome thoughts of going to &s;ervice, which he did for a little while; but work not agreeing with him at all, he borrowed a &s;ilver &s;poon, and &s;ome other odd trifles, and marched off one evening without taking his leave, and went directly to one of his countrymen, who di&s;po&s;ed of his things, but was angry with him for leaving his place with &s;o little booty, which James begged him not to take notice of, for another time he &s;hould find he would do better.</P>
<P>In a little time after, he got into a noble lord's family, where he behaved for twenty months very well, and got the love of all the &s;er|vants, particularly of Mrs. Betty the chamber|maid, who was continually treating him with one good thing or other, and he in return, pro|fe&s;&s;ing a great deal of love and &s;incerity; which made the girl grow &s;o fond of him, that he in a &s;hort time got all that was in her power to give, and then looked as cold on her as a &s;inking trade&s;man does on a de&s;perate dun; which Betty perceiving, tried all manner of ways to endear her&s;elf to him, but all to no purpo&s;e, for the young &s;park was fallen in love with an ale-hou&s;e man's daughter, where the &s;ervants u&s;ed to drink, and entirely for&s;ook poor Betty; who, enraged at &s;uch u&s;age, could not forbear expo&s;ing her folly by upbraiding of him, which had no other effect',
<PB N="121" REF="035355_0120_10049F1921DEE9E8">but making her&s;elf be laughed at, and hardened him in his impudence; who went on without controul in his amours with his new mi&s;tre&s;s, and le&s;t his old one to learn more wit.</P>
<P>The young tapla&s;h proud of her conque&s;t, that &s;he &s;hould rival one of my lord's maids, ea&s;ily gave up her&s;elf to his embraces, and denied him nothing that was in her power to grant, which put Jemmy quite on another footing from the re&s;t of his fellow &s;ervants; &s;he keeping the bar had the care of the money, &s;o that Jemmy had his watch and what not, and appeared as great as ma&s;ter any body, and neglected his lord's &s;ervice to follow his gaming tables and whores, for which he &s;oon lo&s;t his place, and had nothing to depend on, but what he got from his &s;weet-heart; who continually &s;upplying his extrava|gancies, reduced her father to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities, that he was obliged to confe&s;s a judgment to the brewer, who, a little after, &s;eized upon all he had, and turned him out of doors.</P>
<P>Jemmy had nothing now to depend on but his own good fortune, and &s;he proving a jilt, as &s;he often does to per&s;ons given to extravagance, he was &s;oon reduced to very great wants, when be|ing arre&s;ted and thrown into Mar&s;hal&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, be got acquainted with one Thomas Butler, a country|man of his, with whom he agreed to break out of pri&s;on and go on the lay; which they did, and were very &s;ucce&s;sful for &s;ome time, 'till Butler was taken and committed to Newgate, and hung the next &s;e&s;&s;ions, and Jemmy very narrow|ly e&s;caped by &s;ighting his way through the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>

He &s;till kept a corre&s;pondence with his mi&s;tre&s;s, and made her become as wicked as him&s;elf, &s;he turning &s;hop-lifter and pickpocket, and he rob|bing on the highway, by which they had got near a thou&s;and pounds, and then agreed to part, but upon condition of being &s;erviceable to one another; and the town being too hot for him, he removed to Lanca&s;hire, a fortune hunting, and &s;he continued in town to &s;ee what would offer in her way, where &s;he got acquainted with Moll Flanders, who lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e with her, pa&s;&s;ed for a great fortune; &s;he per&s;uaded her to go down with her into the country, where &s;he might live much cheaper and with more plea|&s;ure at her brother's hou&s;e, who was a gentleman of a very good e&s;tate in Ireland, or at her &s;i&s;ter's who lived near Liverpool, which Moll at length agreed to, not knowing well what el&s;e to do with her&s;elf, but that was more than the other knew.</P>
<P>Upon the road &s;he treated Moll with all the civilities imaginable, and at Warrington her pretended brother met them in a gentleman's coach, and carried them to Liverpool, where they were entertained in a merchant's hou&s;e three or four days very hand&s;omely, and from thence they went to a gentleman's hou&s;e about forty miles di&s;tant, where was a numerous family, a noble &s;eat and good company, whom &s;he called cou|&s;ins: Here they &s;tayed about &s;ix weeks, and then came back to a village near Liverpool, where her brother, as &s;he called him, began to make love to Moll, &s;etting him&s;elf out as a man of a thou&s;and pounds a year, and indeed talked as big of his &s;eats and parks, as one would be in|clined
<PB N="123" REF="035355_0122_10049F1AB58D7900">to think he had &s;uch an e&s;tate, but it was all a &s;ham. Moll was not behind in putting her|&s;elf off, although &s;he never plainly told them what &s;he had, yet &s;he did not contradict what her companion &s;aid, who reported her to be a wi|dow worth ten thou&s;and pounds; which &s;o en|flamed '&s;quire Mac Faul, that he was ready to run mad at the bait, and plunged into debt over head and ears, for the expences of his court&s;hip; and for fear his e&s;tate &s;hould be looked into, he never &s;o much as a&s;ked about her fortune, but took upon tru&s;t what&s;oever his old mi&s;tre&s;s told him, and promi&s;ed his new one &s;uch brave things, that &s;he imagined &s;he &s;hould be a lady, when &s;he had got her e&s;tate.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon married, and nothing but love and kindne&s;s pa&s;&s;ed between them, he eve|ry day telling her of the fine things &s;he was to have when they came to Ireland, and &s;he en|deavouring to improve his affections by her fond|ne&s;s and good behaviour; till at length he be|gan to di&s;cover her intentions of going to We&s;t-Che&s;ter, in order to embark for Ireland, but a&s;k|ed his wife if &s;he had no affairs to &s;ettle at Lon|don before &s;he went off; to which &s;he an&s;wering No; he &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;aid. Ma|dam, what have we been a doing? I thought the bulk of your e&s;tate lay in the bank: Indeed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I have no e&s;tate, nor did I tell you I had; I know not what your &s;i&s;ter might &s;ay to you, but I did never tell her of any &s;uch thing; at which he &s;tarted like a madman, and &s;wore he had been impo&s;ed on, to the la&s;t degree; and then calling his &s;i&s;ter, he a&s;ked her haw &s;he could
<PB N="124" REF="035355_0123_10049F1CABA9D370">&s;erve him &s;o? Very well, &s;aid &s;he, and not half &s;o much as you de&s;erved; how could you ruin my poor aged father, debauch me, and bring me into all the vices of life; and at la&s;t neglect me, and &s;et up for a fortue in the coun|try? But, &s;aid he, what had this gentlewoman done to you that you would ruin her? and then looking upon his wife, he fell down upon his knees and &s;aid, you would indeed have been cheat|ed, my dear, but you would not have been un|done; for ten thou&s;and pounds would have maintained us both very hand&s;omely in Ireland, and I re&s;olved to dedicate every groat to you; I would not have wronged you of a &s;hilling, and the re&s;t I would have made up in my affection to you, and my tenderne&s;s of you as long as I lived; which he &s;aid with tears in his eyes, and offered to give her a bill of fifty pounds, which he &s;wore was all he had in the world; which &s;he a&s;&s;uring him was more than &s;he had, and that &s;he came into the country only to live cheap, her whole income not exceeding fifteen pounds a year; at which he &s;hook his head, and remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time; and then &s;aid, Come, my dear, though the ca&s;e is bad, it is to no purpo&s;e to be dejected be as ea&s;y as you can; I will en|deavour to find out &s;ome way or other to live: if you can but &s;ub&s;i&s;t your&s;elf, that is better than nothing, I mu&s;t try the world again: a man ought to think like a man: to be di&s;couraged is to yield to the misfortune. And then going to bed, he promi&s;ed a great many things, but no|thing could offer, when thore was nothing to be|gin with; 'till at la&s;t he fell a&s;leep; and ro&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="035355_0124_10049F211E5B7048">betimes in the morning, and took his hor&s;es and three &s;ervants, all his linen and baggage, and went away, leaving a letter on the table, with twenty guineas in it, advi&s;ing her with that mo|ney to make the be&s;t of her way to London; but a terror falling upon his mind, when he had rid about fifteen miles, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants, &s;old their hor&s;es, came back, and told her he would accompany her in her way to London, which &s;he agreed to, and in two days time they &s;et out from Che&s;ter, he on hor&s;eback, and &s;he in the &s;tage-coach, and came to Dun&s;table toge|ther, where he told her it was convenient to leave her, for rea&s;ons which were improper for her to know.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired him to &s;tay with her there a week or two, which he agreed to, in which time &s;he told him how that &s;he had been in Virginia, and that &s;he had now a mother there; and that if her effects had come &s;afe to hand, &s;he might have enough to have maintained them both very hand&s;omely as long as they lived; and that if he had a mind to go there, &s;he believed &s;he could rai&s;e about three hundred pounds, which was &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a plantation, upon which they might live very well; but he would upon no account agree to it; but &s;aid &s;uch a &s;um of money as that would &s;tock a farm in Ireland of an hundred pounds a year, on which they might live as hand&s;omely as a gentleman of five hun|dred here, and that he had laid a &s;cheme to go over and try: which if it did not &s;ucceed, he a&s;&s;ured her, he would go with her to America

<P>He had not rid far before he met with the three young gentlemen who were his &s;ervants, and were newly &s;et up in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, with whom he j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gth, and they all went in pur&s;uit of a prize together.

When he found that his old man John the groom, took his part, he was far the &s;toute&s;t of them all. and &s;o got away without much difficulty, only a volley or two of cur&s;es, &s;wearing they would be revenged on him &s;ome time or other.</P>
<P>He, with tru&s;ty John, returned to Brickhill, where the landlord received them with all the tokens of re&s;pect immaginable, and after &s;upper and a bottle, each went to his bed, and in the morning each took his hor&s;e, and went about their bu&s;ine&s;s. They had not gone far, before they met with the Che&s;ter &s;tage-coach, in which was an old rich p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tty-fogger, who was coming to London about law; which they knew was not his right proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore they made bold to borrow of him an hundred pieces, which they told him they would l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y out to better u&s;es, and &s;o left the lawyer to patch up his cau&s;e as well as he could, all which&punc; Mac-Faul gave to John to &s;ettle him in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, and then made the be&s;t of his way acro&s;s the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untry, to|wards Bri&s;tol, in order to pa&s;s over to Ireland.</P>
<P>In his journey he happened to meet the Bath coach, in which were two citizens wives, who were going to drink the waters, is hopes to re|turn pregnant home to their hu&s;bands, from whom he took their cold watches, rings, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> forty pound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in money, and then po&s;ted
<PB N="128" REF="035355_0127_10049EEC61872CF8">to Bri&s;tol, where a &s;hip being ready to &s;ail for Ireland, he went on board, and in two days ar|rived at Cork, from whence he went to Carrick|fergus, where he &s;et him&s;elf up for a man of for|tune, and told his country men that he had been in England, and that he had married a great for|tune, and that &s;he was dead, and left him very rich, and that he was come over there to pur|cha&s;e an e&s;tate to &s;ettle among&s;t them. By my &s;houl, that is very good news, &s;aid his &s;i&s;ter Nan|ny, for we heard long ago, that you were turned a rapparee, and hang'd at London. No, you fool, &s;aith he, there's no &s;uch thing as hanging of Iri&s;hmen in that country. We borrow a little money from &s;ome good natured woman or other, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and turn gentlemen, marry half a &s;core, rather than not be obliging to the fair &s;ex; and when we have done, break their hearts as &s;oon as we cap. In faith, &s;ays Nanny, I'll go over, and &s;ee if I can't have as many hu&s;bands; for one may &s;tay here all one's life|time, and never be married, and what then, and who has to do with that? So thou &s;halt, Nan|ny, &s;aid be; but &s;tay till I return, and I'll take thee along with me, which happened &s;ooner than he expected, for he having got acquainted with an Engli&s;h gentleman's family, pretended to great riches, and that he had a mind to &s;ettle there, was admitted to court his &s;i&s;ter, who had a thou&s;and pounds to her fortune, which he ma|naged &s;o artfully by his a&s;&s;urance and applica|tion, that he &s;oon got the lady's con&s;ent; and he pre&s;ented her with one of the gold watches and a diamond ring, that he had taken from the citi|zen's
<PB N="129" REF="035355_0128_10049EF203C5A320">wives in the Bath coach, which made a mighty figure in that part of the country: with which they were u&s;ed to walk abroad as if they had been already married, till all things were prepared for the wedding; when an unlucky ac|cident happened, which knocked all in the head: For as the lovers were riding out one day, he dropt a letter, which he had lately received from Moll Flanders, wherein &s;he informed him what a hue and cry there was after him, and told him he would certainly be hanged if ever he returned to England, and therefore advi&s;ed him to &s;ettle there; for &s;he was married to a change broker at London; which being taken up by one of the &s;ervants, and brought to the gentleman, he grew very unea&s;y, till the &s;i&s;ter came home, for fear they &s;hould be married privately. As &s;oon as &s;he came home, he called her a&s;ide, and &s;hewed her the letter, advi&s;ing her to return tho&s;e pre|&s;ents &s;he had received from him, and have no more to &s;ay to him, which the young lady wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very unwilling to do; but her brother told her Mac-Faul was certainly a rogue, and this Moll Flanders, from whom he received the letter was one of the greate&s;t thieves in London. I have heard an hundred &s;tories of her, &s;aid he, when I was la&s;t &s;ummer in England; and yet nobody can take her, altho' &s;he is playing her pranks in one di&s;gui&s;e or other every day.</P>
<P>This was very unplea&s;ant news to the young gentlewoman, who had placed her affections en|tirely upon Mac-Faul, who had a very pretty way of addre&s;s, and in him&s;elf was a good per|&s;onable man; and what troubled her mo&s;t of all
<PB N="130" REF="035355_0129_10049EF397EA8F00">was, to part with the gold watch and diamond ring, with which &s;he had made a figure among the ladies above a month; but if it mu&s;t be &s;o, &s;aid &s;he, and then &s;he fell a crying, "Mac-Faul can never be a rogue, &s;o fine a gentleman as Mac-Faul to be a thief, it can never be; this Moll Flanders is &s;ome ill woman, who has con|trived this letter, on purpo&s;e to min his happi|ne&s;s. I will never leave him, I will die with him," and a great deal of &s;uch &s;illy &s;tuff; &s;o that with all the brother could do, he could &s;carce prevail with her to forbear marrying him, till he heard from England.</P>
<P>The next time Mac-Faul came to the hou&s;e, the gentleman &s;hewed him the letter, which he &s;tifly denied, and prote&s;ted it did not belong to him, and &s;eemed to wonder who &s;hould put &s;uck a trick upon him; for he &s;wore ten thou|&s;and oaths, that he knew no more of it than the man in the moon; but all would not avail, the gentleman civilly de&s;ired him to forbear coming to his hou&s;e, till he &s;hould be better &s;atisfied from his friends in London, and in the mean time gave his word no man &s;hould make appli|cation to his &s;i&s;ter in the way of court&s;hip, till then. Mac-Faul begged only to &s;ee her, that he might take his leave civilly of her; which upon no account would be granted, for the young la|dy was as di&s;con&s;olate as he, &amp; narrowly watch|ed, &s;o that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to have any intercour&s;e, which &s;o enraged Mac-Faul, that he &s;ent the gentlemen a challenge who ac|cepted it, and the next morning was to deter|mine the ju&s;tice of their preten&s;ions, when the

<P>Mac-Faul made the be&s;t of his way to the bogs and there &s;heltered him&s;elf among a parcel of rap|parees, till he met with an opportunity, and di&s;|gui&s;e, to &s;hip him&s;elf for England, which he did in the habit of a highlander, and he got &s;afe to Brecknock in Wales, where he took a lodging at a widow woman's hou&s;e whom he gagged and robbed of about forty &s;hillings, and bru&s;hed off in the night: from thence cro&s;&s;ed the country, till he came to Shrew&s;bury, where he &s;tole a nag out of King's-land, and made the be&s;t of his way to|wards London, and about two hours after meet|ing with a country farmer, who was going to pay re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, he told him, he thought he rid very unea&s;y, and would lend him his hor&s;e, for the &s;ake of his company, which the farmer mode&s;ty refu&s;ed, and he as impudently in&s;i&s;ted on, till com|ing to a convenient place, he knocked him off his hor&s;e, and &s;wore if he would not change hor&s;es,

They told him a couple of gen|tlemen, who they believed would be very glad of his company, which he was very well plea&s;ed with, and de&s;ired the landlord to enquire, if a &s;tranger might be admitted, which they readily agreed to. and Mr. Mac-Faul was admitted, with as much ceremony, as if he had been a coun|try ju&s;tice of the peace, who behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much courte&s;y, that after a bottle or two, a friend&s;hip &s;eemed to be cemented among&s;t them. The gentlemen were frank and open, and Mac-Faul as full of enquiry as was con&s;i&s;tent with his intere&s;t, till at la&s;t he perceived they were a cou|ple of graziers ju&s;t come from London, whom he thought per&s;ons worth his better acquaintance,
<PB N="133" REF="035355_0132_10049EFE32F5D278">and having informed him&s;elf which way they were to travel in the morning, he &s;aid he &s;hould be glad of their company, and accordingly &s;etting out together, they had not rode above two miles, before he told them his bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he mu&s;t have a little ready money, which was what they did not care to hear of; however for quietne&s;s &s;ake, they were forced to &s;ubmit, and gave him what they had about them, which amounted to about one hundred pounds, with which he rode off, and bid them take care what company they fell into for the future, which they very wi&s;ely told him they would, and wi&s;hed him good luck with his bargain; but it &s;eems it was done with a cur&s;e.</P>
<P>In half an hour after this, a couple of jolly fellows met him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> gave him the word &s;tand; which language he not being u&s;ed to, immediate|ly drew his pi&s;tol, and let fly; this &s;o &s;urpriz'd the two thieves, that they pre&s;ently began to capitulate, and upon a little further enquiry, found one another to be all Cavalier collectors on the king's highway; and although it is &s;aid two of a trade can never agree, yet they entered into a fa&s;t triple alliance, that was never broke till two of them were hanged, and their necks broken with a rope as you &s;hall hear more hereafter. And now they frankly communicated to each other the danger they were in, and judg|ed it &s;afe&s;t, to make the be&s;t of their way towards Dun&s;table, near which place they robbed two coaches, and &s;ome travellers of lace, which in all amounted to near five hundred pounds; but were

<P>After this he robbed &s;ometimes with his com|panions, and &s;ometimes by him&s;elf; but having got &s;even or eight hundred pounds, he did not run &s;uch de&s;perate ri&s;ques as formerly, altho' he met with &s;everal hard and de&s;perate encounters on the road, by which he had received &s;everal wounds, and &s;ome very terrible ones indeed, par|ticularly one with a pi&s;tol bullet, which broke his arm, and another with a &s;word, which run him quite thro' the body; but it mi&s;&s;ing his vitals he it cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed again; one of his new comrades having kept with him &s;o faithfully, that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in riding four&s;core miles before his arm was &s;et, and then got a &s;urgeon in a con&s;iderable city re|more from the place where it was done, pretend|ing they were gentlemen travelling towards Car|li&s;le, and had been attacked on the road by high|waymen, whom they re&s;i&s;ted, one of them having &s;hot him through the arm.</P>
<P>The cure being pretty chargeable, and they lying about &s;ix months out of bu&s;ine&s;s, they made the be&s;t of their way to Houn&s;low, where meet-with a coach and &s;ix, they robbed it of near two hundred pounds in money and jewels, and twogold

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Gilder-Roy a Murderer, Ra|vi&s;her, Incendiary, and Highwayman.</HEAD>
<P>THIS villain was de&s;cended of an ancient fa|mily, and born in Perth&s;hire in the Highlands of Scotland; who&s;e father dying ju&s;t as he came of age, left him 80 marks a year, which he &s;quan|dered away in le&s;s than a year and a half, and then lived upon his mother, till &s;he found no hopes of reclaiming him. When with-holding her hand, he bur&s;t one night into her bed cham|ber and cut her throat from ear to ear, and then ravi&s;hed his own &s;i&s;ter and the maid; and after|wards
<PB N="136" REF="035355_0135_10049F29AA21FAF0">robbing the hou&s;e, &s;et it a fire, and burnt them both in it.</P>
<P>This unparalleled piece of villainy &s;oon made a noi&s;e all over the kingdom, upon which a pro|clamation was i&s;&s;ued out, promi&s;ing a hundred pounds reward, to take him dead or alive, which made him fly into France, where he picked Car|dinal Richlieu's pocket as he was &s;aying ma&s;s at St. Dennis's in Paris: which the king perceiving, Gilder Roy made motions to the king, not to take any notice, and he &s;hould &s;ee good &s;port; upon which the king let him alone; and after prayers going to the cardinal, he a&s;ked him if he had an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> money about him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who mi&s;&s;ing his pur&s;e, fell into a great &s;urpri&s;e; but the king knowing which way it went, fell a laughing; till being tired with laughter, he was willing the cardinal &s;hould know what was become of it: For the king thinking the thief to be an hone&s;t man, was willing the car|dinal &s;hould have his money again; but Gilder-Roy had more wit in his anger, than to come near either of them; which the cardial finding, turn|ed all his laughter again&s;t the king, which made him &s;wear it was the fir&s;t time that ever a thief made him his confederate. Upon this, flying out of France into Spain, he went upon a day of public entertainment to the duke of Medina Ca|ll's hou&s;e, where &s;eeing &s;everal pieces of plate in a trunk, ready for the &s;ervants to attend their lords with, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a Spani&s;h habit, like the &s;teward of the hou&s;e, and de&s;iring the &s;ervants to &s;it off the trunk, he carried it away.</P>
<P>By this time Gilder-Roy, thinking all the noi&s;e was over about him in his own country, re&s;olved
<PB N="137" REF="035355_0136_10049F2E75DE5820">to go to Scotland again, where he &s;oon became as notorious a highwayman, as ever was in the country before. He fir&s;t robbed the earl of Lith lingow of a gold watch, a diamond ring, and 80 pieces of gold; by which he became &s;o terrible, that people were afraid to travel; and when he wanted money, he would go into Athol, Locha|ber, Angeni, Mar, Baqueham; Murrey, Suther|land, and all over the north, and drive away their cattle, unle&s;s they paid him contributions, which they did quarterly.</P>
<P>One time Oliver Cromwell embarking at Do|naghadee, in the North of Ireland, landed at Port-Patrick, in Scotland, which Gilder-Roy hearing of, met him and two &s;ervants in the road to Gla&s;gow, bidding him &s;tand and deliver; when, after the exchange of &s;ome pi&s;tols, Gilder-Roy made off, and they pur&s;ued him, when Gilder-Roy turning &s;hort, &s;hot Oliver's hor&s;e, which fal|ling down broke Oliver's leg; then he killed one of the &s;ervants, and gave the other quarter; which done, finding Oliver lame, he tied his legs under an a&s;s's belly, and &s;ent them both to &s;eek their fortune.</P>
<P>Three of his companions being taken, and &s;ent to Gla&s;gow goal, were ordered to be hanged in chains; which Gilder-Roy re&s;enting, he vowed revenge one time or other; and a little after, meeting the judge upon the road to Aberdeen, he &s;tripped his coachman and two footmen, tied them neck and heels, and threw, them into a pond; he then robbed the judge and killed his four hor&s;es, and carried him to the tree where
<PB N="138" REF="035355_0137_10049F300EEBD6E8">his companions hanged, (which in Scotland is like a turn &s;tile) where upon the fourth beam he hang|ed the judge, &s;aying, "By my &s;ol, mun, as this &s;tructure, erected to break people's cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igs, is not uniform without another, I'&s;e mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'en hang you upon the vacant beam." At length, his villainies grew &s;o intolerable, that he gloried not only in robbing, but murdering men, ravi&s;hing women, and burning hou&s;es. But a proclamation coming out with a reward of 1000 marks, to take him dead or alive, one Peg Cunnigham, a &s;trump|et with whom he kept company, betrayed him; when finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded with 50 men; he ran into her bed-chamber, and ripped up the har|lot's guts, and then killed 7 of his adver&s;aries, before they could take him; but at la&s;t being overcome, he was taken and carried to Edin|burgh ca&s;te, where he was kept in irons three days, without victuals or drink, and then hanged without any proce&s;s, on a gibbet 50 feet high, in April 1658, aged 34 years; and afterwards hanged on another gibbet 40 feet high, on the road betwixt Leith and Edinburgh.</P>

<P>After this, Tom was pretty &s;ucce&s;sful in his villany, for above five years. Once he under|took for 500 pounds to &s;ave a gentleman that was condemned; hereupon, when ju&s;t as the judge was about to pa&s;s the &s;entence, he cried out to the bench that he had committed that robbery; upon which the gentleman was cleared and when they came to try him, the evidence not pre&s;uming to &s;wear again&s;t him, they having &s;worn po&s;itively again&s;t the other, he was ac|quitted al&s;o.</P>
