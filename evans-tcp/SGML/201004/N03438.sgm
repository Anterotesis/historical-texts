<P>The Children and true People of God are &s;et before us in &s;acred Writ, under a Variety of en|dearing Characters, which declare their real Excel|lency, and the high E&s;teem which God the Foun|tain of Honour hath for them.</P>
<P>Here we have them called the Godly &amp; Faithful <HI>Godly.</HI> The Word &s;ignifies, as a learned Man ob|&s;erveth, <Q>A &s;acred Affection of Mercy, Piety, Grace, Benignity, and bountiful Good-Will to|wards any, without Re&s;pect of Merit.</Q> It is tran&s;lated, <HI>Pious, Merciful</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P N="1">1. <HI>They are Godly, who have the Image of God re|&s;tored to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Godly are <HI>God-like,</HI> they re&s;emble God in his communicable Attributes &amp; imitable Perfections. Some of the <HI>divine Attributes</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>incom|municable,</HI> as God's <HI>Immen&s;ity, Unchangeablene&s;s</HI> &amp;c.

However, we mu&s;t always remember that the One is <HI>infinite,</HI> the other <HI>finite.</HI> Math. 19.17. <HI>There is none good but One, that is God.</HI> None e&s;&s;entially, originally, infinitely Good. Now, Man was at fir&s;t created in this Image of God. Gen. 1.26. <HI>And God &s;aid, Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likene&s;s.</HI> And this was, not only as God, the infinite and eternal <HI>Spirit,</HI> breath'd into Man the breath of Life, and gave him a <HI>living Soul</HI> endow'd with Under&s;tanding, Will, &amp; Affections; but in an e&s;pecial Manner is he &s;aid to be made in the Image of God upon the ac|count of the <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> of his Nature, where|by he was fitted to imitate and &s;erve his Maker. Eccl. 7.29. &mdash;<HI>God made Man upright,</HI> <Q>Right, conformable to his Nature and Will, which is the Rule of Right, after his own Likene&s;s, Un|der&s;tanding, Holy, and every way Good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pool</HI> in loc.</NOTE>.</Q> But, how is the Gold become dim! how is the mo&s;t fine Gold changed! Man being in Honour, abode not; he &s;oon fell from his original Purity, forfeit|ed and lo&s;t the Image of God, for him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity. The Crown is fallen from our Head; wo to us that we have &s;inned. For as <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Root and Parent</HI> from whom we all &s;prang in the way of <HI>ordinary Generation;</HI> &s;o it plea&s;ed God to appoint him the <HI>legal Head</HI> and Repre&s;entative of his Po&s;terity in the <HI>fir&s;t Covenant:</HI> And accord|ingly "we &s;inned in him, and fell with him in his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion". Rom. 5.12. <HI>By one Man Sin entred in the World, and Death by Sin.</HI> ver. 19. <HI>By one Man's Di&s;obedience many were made Sinners.</HI> All

the World is become guilty before God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. And we have a <HI>corrupt Nature</HI> deriv'd to us from him. <HI>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? not one,</HI> Job 14.4.</P>
<P>However, the Light of Revelation &s;hews us that this great Lo&s;s of the Image of God is not irrepe|rable. In the Scriptures, that God, who dwells in the Light which no Man can approach unto, de|clareth that there are <HI>Three</HI> that bear record in Heaven, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and the&s;e Three are <HI>One,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.7. That God the Father hath &s;ent forth his Son made of a Wo|man; in whom, being God-Man in one Per&s;on, we behold the Glory of the divine Nature, and humane Nature in its highe&s;t Perfection. And the &s;ame Word declareth that our Lord Je&s;us being in the Form of God, took upon him the Form of a Servant, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s, that he might redeem his People from the Cur&s;e of the Law, and give them power to become the Sons of God; and that they, together with the Privilege of <HI>Adop|tion,</HI> might have the Image of God re&s;tored to them, <HI>being born of God,</HI> Joh. 1.12, 13. Here we are al&s;o taught that in order to their being made Partakers of the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> "not by Communication of the divine E&s;&s;ence to them; but by God's impre&s;&s;ing up|on them Qualities and Di&s;po&s;itions which re&s;em|ble the Perfections of God": I &s;ay, that in order to this, the Son of God hath purcha&s;ed and received the <HI>Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> who by his Office renews his People after the Image of God, when they are born of him; and &s;o enableth them to <HI>put off the old Man which is corrupt; and to put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true Holine&s;s,</HI> Eph. 4.22,-24. Now the&s;e are called <HI>Godly</HI> in Scripture; for they re&s;emble God in Knowlege,
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0006_1003F9F60EAFE340">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, in Goodne&s;s and Truth, Grace and Mercy, according to the Mea&s;ure of the Gift of Chri&s;t; tho' not in &s;inle&s;s Perfection. And even in this Life, beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, <HI>they are changed into the &s;ame I|mage from Glory to Glory,</HI> by the Spirit of the Lord: And they &s;hall be perfectly transform'd into his Likene&s;s when they &s;hall &s;ee him as he is in the Light of Heaven. P&s;al. 17.15. <HI>As for me, I will behold thy Face in Righteou&s;ne&s;s: I &s;hall be &s;atisfied, when I awake, with thy Likene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Godly imitate the ble&s;&s;ed God.</HI></P>
<P>And this naturally follows: Having the Image of God re&s;tor'd, they obey that Word, Eph. 5.1. <HI>Be ye Followers</HI> (or Imitators) <HI>of God, as dear Chil|dren.</HI> The Graces of the Spirit are active Princi|ples of &s;piritual Operations. Is God bound for his own Glory, as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t worthy End? The Godly ob&s;erve that Command, 1 Cor. 10.31. &mdash;<HI>Do all to the Glory of God.</HI> It is their &s;incere Endeavour that in this, their Tho'ts Words and Actions, may unite and center. And when they con&s;ider his infinite Glory, and how far they fall &s;hort of giving him the Honour due to his Name, even in their be&s;t Duties, they &s;ay with <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 42. 5, 6.&mdash;<HI>Now mine Eye &s;eeth thee; where|fore I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI> They fly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God provided in his Son for their Ju&s;tification, and &s;ay with the A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Phil. 3.8, 9. &mdash; <HI>I count all Things but Lo&s;s for the Excellency of the Knowlege of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord: for whom I have &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is

of God by Faith.</HI> Again, as God is <HI>righteous</HI> in all his Ways, and <HI>holy</HI> in all his Works; they endea|vour to &s;erve him in <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> before him, all the Days of their Life; and thus to obey that Word, 1 Pet. 1.15. <HI>As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which hath called you is holy, &s;o be ye Holy in all Manner of Conver&s;a|tion.</HI> They pre&s;ent their Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is their rea&s;onable Service. They &s;eperate them&s;elves from Sin, <HI>deny|ing Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts;</HI> And they con|&s;ecrate their Powers and Talents to the Service of God. It is their endeavour that <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord</HI> may be written upon <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>Again, As the ble&s;&s;ed God is <HI>good to all,</HI> and in a peculiar Manner <HI>good to I&s;rael;</HI> &s;o that Law is written on their Hearts, Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do good unto all Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, e&s;pecially unto them who are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</HI> According to their Ability they do Good, yea are rich in good Works, being de&s;irous that others be|holding them may <HI>glorify</HI> their <HI>heavenly Father,</HI> and that they may approve them&s;elves his <HI>genuine Offspring.</HI> And as God is good to the Unthank|ful and Evil, they &s;trive in this al&s;o to follow him, ob&s;erving their Lord's Command, Mat. 5.44, 5. <HI>Love your Enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de&s;pite|fully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you: That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to ri&s;e on the Evil &amp; on the Good, and &s;endeth Rain on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t.</HI> They are inwardly touch'd with a feeling of the Mi&s;eries of others, and inclin'd to &s;hew Compa&s;&s;ion in Obe|dience to God's Word. Luk. 6.36. <HI>Be ye merciful, as your Father al&s;o is merciful.</HI> They are of a for|bearing forgiving Spirit, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure as God is.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004196_0008_1003FD8FE3BF4690">And then, they behave with becoming Reverence and Subjection, with relation to the <HI>incommunicable Perfections</HI> of God. As God is <HI>infinite</HI> in his Being, and all his divine Excellencies, they <HI>bow down</HI> be|fore Him in religious Adoration, and pay Him <HI>divine Honour.</HI> As He is God <HI>mo&s;t High,</HI> they walk <HI>humbly</HI> with him; <HI>re&s;ign</HI> them&s;elves, and all their Concerns to his <HI>&s;overeign Will.</HI> If God call them to deny them&s;elves, and take up their Cro&s;s, they learn of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>O my Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> Is God <HI>Omnipre&s;ent?</HI> They take care to Walk before Him, and be perfect.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The Godly and Faithful are true and upright in the Covenant of their God, and in their Behaviour towards Him.</HI></P>
<P>They believe that <HI>God is,</HI> and that he is a <HI>Re|warder</HI> of them that diligently <HI>&s;eek him.</HI> They re|ceive his Word as the Word of <HI>God that can't Lie;</HI> and in Obedience to it, give up them&s;elves to the only true and <HI>living God,</HI> who is the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in the <HI>New and Everla&s;ting Covenant,</HI> to be for Him and no other. And this they do in the Exerci&s;e of <HI>true Repen|tance, unfeigned Faith,</HI> and <HI>Love without Di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> They cleave to God with purpo&s;e of Heart, ob|&s;erving that fir&s;t and great Commandment, <HI>Thou &s;halt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</HI> Mat. 22.37, 8. And having Sworn with all the Heart, they re&s;olve, with an entire Dependance on the Grace of God, as P&s;al. 119.106 <HI>I have &s;worn, and I will

perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments.</HI> As the Lord is the true and faithful God, who keep|eth Covenant, &s;o the&s;e abhor the Hypocri&s;y men|tioned, P&s;al. 78.36, 7.&mdash; <HI>They did flatter him with their Mouth, and lied to him with their Tongues.</HI> It is true, they are not altogether without Guile in this Life, as the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us was. They know but in Part, &amp; are &s;anctified in Part; however, they &s;erve God with a perfect Heart in Go&s;pel-&s;incerity, having <HI>Re&s;pect to all his Commandments,</HI> &amp; <HI>hating every fal&s;e Way.</HI> And they mourn for the remaining Hypocri&s;y of their Hearts, with that <HI>godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance.</HI> They are not of double Heart, pre|tending to have an Heart for God, and yet retain|ing an Heart for the World. They realize what our Lord declareth, Mat. 6.24. <HI>No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters: for either he will hate the one and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other. Ye cannot &s;erve God and Mammon.</HI> And act accordingly, renouncing the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil. Their <HI>&s;ecret Sins</HI> are their burden, and they bewail them before God; even tho&s;e evil Thoughts and Inclinations which never appear before Men in overt Acts. They &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t all Sin, &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch as willingly offend in <HI>one Point,</HI> are guilty of <HI>all.</HI> Yea, in faithfulne&s;s to God, and their Covenant Engagements, they cut off the right Hand, and pluck out the right Eye, which offend them, &s;eeking the De&s;truction of tho&s;e Lu&s;ts which have been mo&s;t near and dear to them. They &s;incerely endeavour to lay a&s;ide the Sin which mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets them, and can in &s;ome true Mea|&s;ure &s;ay, as P&s;al. 18.23. <HI>I was upright before him; and I kept my &s;elf from mine Iniquity.</HI> However, finding Sin &s;till cleaving to them and defiling them, they cry out, as Rom. 7.24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this Death!</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0010_1003FD93D8F148D0">
But tho' they complain with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, I find a Law that when I would do Good, Evil is pre&s;ent with me;</HI> yet they can &s;ay al&s;o with him, <HI>I delight in the Law of God, after the inner Man.</HI></P>
<P>Again, they <HI>wor&s;hip God,</HI> who is a Spirit, <HI>in Spi|rit and Truth.</HI> They attend <HI>&s;ecret Duties</HI> in &s;ince|rity; Secret Prayer, Self-Examination &amp;c; and this not meerly to &s;till the clamours of an accu&s;ing Con&s;cience; but that they may walk with that God who is and &s;eeth in Secret, and maintain in|timate Communion with him. And when they attend the <HI>publick Wor&s;hip,</HI> they are not as tho&s;e, Jer. 12.2. <HI>Thou art near in their Mouths, and far from their Reins;</HI> for they believe tho&s;e Words of their Lord, Rev. 2.23. <HI>All the Churches &s;hall know that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e which &s;earcheth the Reins and Hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works.</HI> And then, they endeavour to keep the <HI>Or|dinances</HI> of divine Wor&s;hip <HI>pure,</HI> without corrupt+ing them with humane Inventions; and al&s;o to walk in them <HI>all</HI> blamele&s;s. Upon the whole, they abhor the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;erving the faithful God with a fal&s;e Heart; and are al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of the high Pre&s;umption of attempting this, con&s;idering that all Things are open and naked before Him: And therefore breathe out that Prayer, P&s;al. 26.1, 2. <HI>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my inte|grity: I have tru&s;ted al&s;o in the Lord: therefore I &s;hall not &s;lide. Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my Reins and my Heart.</HI> They do not take up their Religion to &s;erve worldly Views and Inte|re&s;ts, and go &s;o far only in it as will &s;uit the Times; but labour to approve them&s;elves Faithful to their great Lord and Ma&s;ter whatever it co&s;t them. In a Word, <HI>Herein do they Exerci&s;e them&s;elves to have al|ways a Con&s;cience void of Offence toward God, and to|wards Men.</HI> They abide in the <HI>Calling</HI> wherein they

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 Tim. IV. 6, 7, 8.</BIBL>
<Q><P>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</P>
<P>I have fought a good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith.</P>
<P>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them that love his Appearing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Epi&s;tle of the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> (in which he gives &s;uch an agreable Account of him&s;elf) all agree was writ|ten from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> his beloved Son in the Faith. But whether it was the fir&s;t, or the &s;econd Time of his going thither, and appearing before <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> is not &s;o certain. A learned Expo&s;itor has in his Preface to this Epi&s;tle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Hammond.</NOTE>, offered many con&s;iderable Arguments to prove that this was the fir&s;t time of his being at <HI>Rome.</HI> But the Ver&s;es that I have now read, and &s;ome other Ver&s;es in
<PB N="2" REF="004196_0036_1003FD6C308BE6F8">
this Epi&s;tle together with the Po&s;t&s;cript, have in|duced the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erality of learned Men to conclude that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tten the la&s;t time he came thither, and when he had the near and certain Pro&s;pect of his Death.</P>
<P>But when this Epi&s;tle was written is not &s;o much my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, as the Things which are contained in the Ver&s;es now before us. And I think they may all be reduced to the&s;e three general Heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Apo&s;tles <HI>Apprehen&s;ion of him&s;elf</HI> with re|&s;pect to his <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State, namely <HI>that he was now upon the very brink of Death,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Words, <HI>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>His peaceful, and comfortable Reflection upon the pa&s;t Conduct of him&s;elf in the Cour&s;e of his Life,</HI> in tho&s;e Words, <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>His plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect, and joyful Expectation of what he and other Saints &s;hould meet with hereafter. &mdash;Thenceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them al&s;o that love his Appearing.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And the&s;e are accordingly the three general Heads, which I propo&s;e for the Subject of our &s;e|rious Meditation at this time.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle's <HI>Apprehen&s;ion of him&s;elf with re&s;pect to his pre&s;ent State,</HI> namely <HI>that he was now upon the very brink of Death.&mdash;I am now ready to he offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Apo&s;tle is here plainly &s;peaking of his Death; &s;o what I would ob&s;erve under this ge|neral Head, is,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="004196_0037_1003FDCB0D576BA8">1. <HI>The Account he gives of Death, or the Manner in which he de&s;cribes it, viz</HI> as an OFFERING, and a DEPARTURE.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The full Apprehen&s;ion he had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be at Hand, ready even then to come upon him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Calmne&s;s, the Ea&s;ine&s;s, and Freedom, with which he &s;eems to &s;peak or write of if.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us con&s;ider the Account the Apo&s;tle gives of Death, or the Manner in which he de&s;cribes it,</HI> viz. <HI>as an</HI> Offering, <HI>and a</HI> departure.</P>
<P>I am ready to be <HI>Offered,</HI> and my <HI>Departure;</HI>&mdash; which refer to his Death. So then,</P>
<P N="1">1. He calls it an <HI>Offering,</HI> or <HI>pouring out;</HI> for &s;o it is in the Original, <HI>I am now already poured out</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">gap DESC="foreign"</NOTE>. It is ob&s;erved to be the &s;ame Word that is u&s;ed, for the <HI>Drink-Offerings</HI> under the Law, which were won't to be <HI>poured out.</HI> Hence the Word, in the Septuagint or Greek Tran&s;lation for <HI>Drink-Offering;</HI> is derived from the &s;ame Word that the Apo&s;tle here u&s;eth <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb 28.7.</NOTE>. And the Apo&s;tle, if he apprehended with what Death he &s;hould glorify God, might con&s;ider it as a &s;ort of Sacrifice, not by way of Expiation or Atonement; (for there was a &s;ufficiency of that for the greate&s;t Sins, in the Sacrifice that Chri&s;t once made of him&s;elf) but in confirmation of the Truth of the Go&s;pel which he bore Te&s;timo|ny to, and was now about to Seal with his Blood. Hence the Word is ob&s;erved to refer to &s;uch Offer|ings as were for the Confirmation of &s;ome Cove|nant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Leigh, Cri. Sac.</NOTE>. And the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks in the &s;ame Dialect concerning his Death, to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Ch. 2.17. If I <HI>be offered</HI> (the &s;ame Word) upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith. Thus the Apo&s;tle, we may &s;uppo&s;e, looks upon his Death in this View,
<PB N="4" REF="004196_0038_1003FD6EC83C69E8">
even as an offering up of his Life to God; and that he does this very freely and readily, con&s;idering what a Te&s;timony he &s;hould hereby give, and what a Confirmation it would be of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, that new Covenant of Grace, which he had been preaching to the World, ever &s;ince his Conver&s;ion to the chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>But then, if we con&s;ider the <HI>Word,</HI> according to the literal Meaning of it, viz. <HI>a pouring forth;</HI> it may &s;erve to give us &s;ome Idea of Death, which is the <HI>pouring forth</HI> of Life. For the Life goes forth at Death; and in a &s;udden and violent Death, it may be &s;aid to be poured out, in a full continued Stream; and not by Drops, as in a lingring Death. Thus the Blood, which is called the Life of the Bea&s;t, was to be poured out<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xii 16.</NOTE>; when the Bea&s;t was killed for Sacrifice, or for Food. And it was pro|phe&s;yed concerning Chri&s;t, that he &s;hould pour out his Soul unto Death<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah liii 12.</NOTE>. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apo&s;tle according to the common Tran|&s;lation, here &s;peaks of Death as a DIPARTURE. <HI>My Departure is at Hand.</HI></P>
<P>And Death may very properly be called a <HI>De|parture.</HI> For at Death the Soul departs; it departs from the Body, and takes its leave of it for the pre&s;ent. Moreover, Life, Sen&s;e, and Motion, all depart from the Body; and leave it a lifele&s;s &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Carca&s;s, at Death. Nay the Body it &s;elf de|parts at Death. The pre&s;ent Form and Vi&s;age of the Face depart, then <HI>his Beauty con&s;umes away like a Moth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al xxxix. 11.</NOTE>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a his <HI>Countenance is changed, and he is &s;ent away</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job 14. 20.</NOTE>. And the Body becomes &s;uch a loath|&s;ome Spectacle, that the deare&s;t Friends are con|cerned
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0039_1003FDD5140BB6C0">
to have it removed and burled out of their Sight, not to appear any more till the Re&s;urrection. It is a Departure, as the Man at Death departs from his pre&s;ent Hou&s;e and Home to the Grave, <HI>that Hou&s;e appointed for all the Living. For the Wind pa&s;&s;eth over him and he is gone, and the Places</HI> that knew him <HI>&s;hall know him no more</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ciii. 16.</NOTE>. At Death the Man departs from his pre&s;ent Friends and Company, and in&s;tead of being among the Living to Prai&s;e God, he is gone to the Congregation of the Dead. He departs al&s;o from the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s and Em|ployments of Life, to the Place of Silence and In|activity; from the Hurries and Cares and Labours of this Life, to the Grave, where there is no Work, no. Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wi&s;dom. Fur|thermore, he <HI>departs</HI> from his pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Enjoyments; for at Death we leave all behind us, to tho&s;e that come after us. <HI>Naked came we out of our Mother's Womb, and naked &s;hall we return thi|ther</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job i. 21.</NOTE>. Moreover, he <HI>departs</HI> from his pre&s;ent Sor|rows and Sufferings; and if he be a good Man, to that Place where the Wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the Weary be at re&s;t; where he re&s;ts from his Labours, and his Works follow him. In a Word, He departs out of this World; for as our Birth is our Entry into it, &s;o our Death is the Go|ing out of it, &s;o as to have no more to do with it. We go off the Stage, we make our Exit, and appear no more to act any other Part upon it. Thus Death is a <HI>Departure.</HI></P>
<P>But then the Word<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> tran&s;lated a <HI>Departure</HI> is ob&s;erved to &s;ignify more properly a <HI>Di&s;&s;olution.</HI> And this will &s;erve to give us a further Notion of Death; for it may truly be &s;aid of Death that
<PB N="6" REF="004196_0040_1003FD73235092B8">
it is a Di&s;&s;olution. It di&s;&s;olves the vital Union of Soul and Body. That clo&s;e and intimate Union that there has been of the e&s;&s;ential Parts of our Con&s;titution is broken by Death, &s;o that their Relation to, and Dependance upon each other, for their Sen&s;ations or Perceptions, are entirely over for the pre&s;ent. One Part is returned or returning to the Du&s;t as it was, while the other is gone to God that gave it.</P>
<P>Moreover, If we con&s;ider the Body by it &s;elf, Death is the Di&s;&s;olution of it. For in Life there is a clo&s;e &amp; regular Connection of the &s;everal Parts of the Body, whereby they have a near Relation to, and a Dependance and Influence upon each other, which Conjunction, and Connection of the Parts is in the Time of Life pre&s;erved by the Laws of Adhe&s;ion and Attraction, or &s;ome other Way of the Creator that we know nothing about; which at Death begins to di&s;&s;olve. Then the wonderful Structure of the humane Body begins to fall to pie|ces, and this Ma&s;ter-piece of the lower Creation, even all the Members and Organs of the Body that were &s;o <HI>curiou&s;ly wrought in the lowe&s;t Parts if the Earth,</HI> loo&s;e their Form, Situation and Contex|ture, and di&s;&s;olve at length into the &s;ame kind of Du&s;t out of which Man was formed at fir&s;t, with|out any more Form, Connection or Dependance one upon another, than the common Sand or Du&s;t with which it is intermingled. <HI>Du&s;t thou art, and unto Du&s;t &s;halt thou return,</HI> Gen. iii. 19.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come now to con&s;ider, <HI>The full Apprehen&s;i|on the Apo&s;tle had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be ju&s;t at Hand, and ready even then to come upon him.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>now</HI> ready to be offered, and my Departure <HI>is at Hand.</HI> What particular Rea&s;on the Apo&s;tle
<PB N="7" REF="004196_0041_1003FDDCDE27AE48">
had to think &s;o, we are not told. An eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;torian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Echard</HI></NOTE> tells us from the Fathers, that God re|vealed to him, that his Death was approaching, &s;ome Time before this; and that he &s;hould &s;uffer Mar|tyrdom at <HI>Rome,</HI> which cau&s;ed him to ha&s;ten with Joy to the Place. And con&s;idering that <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;ed in every City, of the Bonds and Afflic|tions</HI> that he &s;hould meet with<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 23.</NOTE>; it is no Wonder if he &s;hould give him &s;ome Notice of his Death, that fini&s;hing Stroke of his Sufferings, &s;ome Time before-hand. But whether this be &s;o or no, yet if this was the la&s;t Time of his being at <HI>Rome,</HI> he was in clo&s;e Impri&s;onment, and he might at the Time of his Writing this Epi&s;tle be under a Sentence of Death, at lea&s;t within him&s;elf, which he might ar|gue from the Cruelty and Rage of that bloody Tyrant <HI>Nero,</HI> the roman Emperor, and the fierce Per&s;ecution he was now engaged in again&s;t the Chri&s;tians; and &s;o it proved, for in that Per&s;ecuti|on, and towards the latter End of that Reign, he was beheaded, and <HI>Peter</HI> crucified in <HI>Rome;</HI> and as is generally agreed, on the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>And as the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle had Notice and Warning of his Death, &s;ome how or other, before|hand, &s;o it has been with others, they have had &s;ome Revelation or Intimations of their Death, &s;ome Time before it has come upon them. Thus <HI>Aaron</HI> had expre&s;s Notice of his Death, when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was ordered to take him, and <HI>Eliezer</HI> his Son to Mount <HI>Hor;</HI> and told him that <HI>Aaron &s;hould he ga|thered unto his People, and die there</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Numb. xx. 25, 26.</NOTE>. And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf had it revealed unto him, that he &s;hould go up and die at Mount <HI>Nebo</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 49.</NOTE>. And <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Tran&s;|lation was revealed before-hand, not only to him,
<PB N="8" REF="004196_0042_1003F9EA75BEE170">
but to <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> and to the <HI>Sons of the Prophets,</HI> who ask'd <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> whether he knew <HI>that the Lord would take away his Ma&s;ter from his Head that Day?</HI> To which he replies, <HI>that he knew it</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings ii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And altho' the&s;e are extraordinary In&s;tances, and the mo&s;t common Ca&s;e is that of good old <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> who <HI>knew not the Day of his Death.</HI> That is, not the very Day, nor particular Time that Life will come to an End; yet God in his Providence of|tentimes gives fair Intimations to Men that their Departure is at Hand. This is the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e that are of an advanced Age, and have the De|cays of Nature growing apace upon them. This is al&s;o the Ca&s;e of &s;uch as are &s;eized with mortal Sick|ne&s;&s;es, and under uncontroulable Langui&s;hments; for when &s;uch Di&s;tempers prevail, notwith&s;tanding all the Means u&s;ed for the Removal of them; they give fair Intimations that our Di&s;&s;olution ap|proaches, and that the Time of our Departure is at hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. What I propo&s;ed further to ob&s;erve under this fir&s;t general Head was, <HI>The Calmne&s;s, Ea&s;ine&s;s and Freedom with which he &s;peaks of his Death or Depar|ture,</HI> which he apprehended to be at hand.</P>
<P>And by what follows in my Text it appears that he was not under any Ruffle or Perplexity of Mind, at his Thinking or Writing of his Death. The realizing Thought of Death, or of its being ju&s;t at hand, was no Surprize to him. He had been in <HI>Deaths oft,</HI> yea he as it were <HI>died daily;</HI> he had been expecting and waiting for it, and the News of its Approach in&s;tead of &s;tirring up any Fear or Terror, it afforded Matter of Rejoycing to him, and he was ready to bid it welcome. He tells us
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0043_1003FDE57779D3F8">
in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Chap. i. 23. That he had a <HI>De&s;ire to depart, and to be with Chri&s;t; which was far better</HI> than to be here. And he heid &s;ted|dy of the &s;ame Mind, now he &s;aw Death approach|ing, and coming in good earne&s;t. The <HI>Jeopardy he was in every Hour,</HI> had made Death very familiar to him; and it &s;eemed to be no more to him than to fall a&s;leep; for &s;o he calls it, <HI>a Sleep in Je&s;us.</HI> And as to what followed after Death, that was a Joy rather than any Fear to him, con&s;idering the Promi&s;es and the Pro&s;pects which the Go&s;pel af|forded him.</P>
<P>And now this is the happy Privilege of &s;ome o|thers of the eminent Saints and faithful Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that Death cea&s;es to be <HI>the King of Terrors</HI> unto them, and the near, yea the immedi|ate Pro&s;pects of it, are no Surprize to them. Nay, &s;ome who <HI>through fear of Death have all their Life time been &s;ubject to Bondage,</HI> yet when Death has actually drawn near, and they have &s;een them|&s;elves a going, all their Fears have been &s;cattered, and they have been able to &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;alm xxiii. 4. <HI>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy Staff they comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>But now, what was it that afforded &s;uch Calm|ne&s;s and Comfort to the Apo&s;tle under the Appre|hen&s;ions of Death? Why, it was the Reflection he had upon his pa&s;t Conduct; and &s;o the lively Views and certain Pro&s;pect of the Glory and Hap|pine&s;s that follow after Death and the Judgment. Which leads me to the other general Heads I pro|po&s;ed to con&s;ider, and which lye &s;o obvious in my Text. So then,</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us con&s;ider, <HI>The peaceful and comfortable Reflection of the Apo&s;tle upon his Conduct, in the
<PB N="10" REF="004196_0044_1003FD7B2EC24A88">

<P>The holy Apo&s;tle being come to the Clo&s;e of Life; he looks back upon what was pa&s;t, to &s;ee how he had managed, and behaved him&s;elf in the World.</P>
<P>And what can be more proper, than for a Man when he is ju&s;t fini&s;hing the Scene of Life, to take a Review of the &s;everal Parts of it, and &s;ee how he has managed him&s;elf: Whether he has an&s;wer|ed the great End of Living, or fru&s;trated the grand De&s;ign of his Being? Whether his Life has been to any good Purpo&s;e, to the Honour of God and for the Good of others, as well as for the further|ing his own Salvation? Whether he has lived as the Grace of God has taught him? This is nece&s;&s;a|ry for a Man in order to the removing his Fears of Death, and &s;ettling his Hopes and Expectations of a future Glory upon a good Foundation. For as we have behaved our &s;elves in this World, &s;o may we expect it will fare with us in the World that is to come. For here we &s;tand Probationers for the eternal State, and we &s;hall receive of our righ|teous Judge <HI>according to the things done in the Bo|dy, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil,</HI> 2 Cor. viii. 10.</P>
<P>And now the Apo&s;tle upon a &s;erious, thorough and impartial Review of his pa&s;t Life, was able to give a good Account of it, which gave him &s;uch a Calm in the near Pro&s;pect, and &s;uch Courage in the very Hour of Death, He had this for his Re|joycing, even the Te&s;timony of his Con&s;cience that he had fought the good Fight, that he had fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e, and that he had kept the Faith.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="004196_0045_1003FDEAEF741240">I. <HI>He had fought the good Fight.</HI></P>
<P>Here is an Allu&s;ion (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) to the grecian or roman Games, in which there were <HI>Fight|ings,</HI> as well as <HI>Wre&s;tlings</HI> and <HI>Racings;</HI> and &s;o he had engaged in the chri&s;tian Combat: He had li&s;t|ed under Chri&s;t's Banner, and waged War with the Enemies and Oppo&s;ers of Chri&s;tianity; and had <HI>fought manfully under the Captain of his Salvation; had endured Hardne&s;s, as a good Soldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> He conflicted with great Difficulties, &amp; patiently &s;uffered the &s;harpe&s;t Per&s;ecutions, &amp; all Manner of Hard&s;hips, &s;hort of Death, &amp; now was going to &s;uffer <HI>that,</HI> for the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t &amp; of his Go&s;pel. And what a long Catalogue of his Sufferings does he give us in 2 Cor. xi. 23, &mdash; 27. <HI>In Labours mere abundant, in Stripes above mea&s;ure, in Pri&s;ons more frequent, in Deaths oft, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by my own Countrymen, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wilderne&s;s, in Pe|rils in the Sea, in Perils among fal&s;e Brethren; in Wearine&s;s and Painfulne&s;s, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thir&s;t, in Fa&s;tings often, in Cold and Nakedne&s;s.</HI> But he &s;urmounted the&s;e Difficul|ties, overcame all the&s;e Oppo&s;itions; and <HI>came off a Conquerer, yea, more than a Conquerer, through Chri&s;t that loved him.</HI></P>
<P>And now, altho' we have not is all Re&s;pects the &s;ame Enemies to fight again&s;t, not &s;uch Difficulties and Dangers to encounter, no &s;uch fierce Oppo&s;iti|ons and Per&s;ections from the civil Power, who were at that Time the profe&s;&s;ed Enemies of Chri&s;t; yet there is, as we are told, Job vii. 1. according to the marginal Reading, <HI>a Warfare to Man upon Earth;</HI> and a good Fight which we mu&s;t be able to &s;ay we have fought, if we would have Peace and Comfort in a dying Hour. There are &s;piritual, and fle&s;hly, and worldly Lu&s;ts, (all which war a|gain&s;t

There are al&s;o the Examples of the Wicked, the Enticements of Sinners, and the corrupt Cu&s;toms of the World, and our own evil Habits, to oppo&s;e and conquer; and la&s;t of all, there is our <HI>Adver&s;ary the Devil, who as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>And we mu&s;t be able to &s;ay that we have waged and carried on a War with the&s;e our Enemies, that we have been fighting with them, that we have re|&s;i&s;ted and overcome them. We mu&s;t be able to &s;ay, that by the Grace of Chri&s;t, <HI>we have crucified the Fle&s;h, with all it's Affections and Lu&s;ts;</HI> that we have watched &amp; guarded again&s;t the Snares of the World, and have by Faith gain'd the Victory over it, &s;o as in a good Mea&s;ure to get above the Hopes or Fears, the Frowns or Flatteries of it. And that we re&s;i&s;t the Devil, &s;o as to cau&s;e him to flee from us. In a Word, We are &s;o to fight and &s;truggle with our Lu&s;ts, and all our &s;piritual Enemies, as to come to &s;uch a Pa&s;s, that no Iniquity has the Do|minion over us.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apo&s;tle <HI>fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e,</HI> or run his Race. Alluding &s;till to the I&s;thmian &amp; Olympick Games. And what he here informs us concerning him&s;elf was, that notwith&s;tanding all the Difficul|ties and Dangers, and Oppo&s;itions in his Way; yet he kept on his Cour&s;e, diligently, &s;teddily, vigo|rou&s;ly and per&s;everingly, even unto the End.</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t had witne&s;&s;ed <HI>in every City, that Bonds and Afflictions waited for him;</HI> but &s;ays he, with a noble Courage and Re&s;olution, becoming an Apo&s;tle, <HI>None of the&s;e Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my &s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Mini&s;try I have received of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> Acts xx. 23, 24.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004196_0047_1003FDEF331DC508">The Apo&s;tle had a Race to run, as a Chri&s;tian, and as a Mini&s;ter; and in both the&s;e Re&s;pects he fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e; that is, he faithfully di&s;charged the Duties which the Go&s;pel required of him, as a Chri&s;tian, and as an Apo&s;tle.

<P>And as the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, &s;o every Chri&s;tian has a Race to run, a Cour&s;e to fini&s;h, if he would fini&s;h his Life with Peace, and receive a Crown hereafter.

<P N="3">3. The Apo&s;tle had this Te&s;timony, that <HI>he had kept the Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Which intends either,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he kept the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of his Faith.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o terrified by the Enemies of Chri&s;t, nor at the Rage and Fury of his cruel Per&s;ecutors; but that in the mid&s;t of Danger, &amp; Death, he open|ly and courageou&s;ly profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t, and his holy Religion.

And altho' the Cro&s;s, that is the Sufferings &amp; ignominious Death of Chri&s;t were to <HI>the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooli&s;hne&s;s;</HI> yet he glories in nothing more than in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, he being to them who are called <HI>the Power of God, and the Wi&s;dom of God</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor&punc; i. 23, 24.</NOTE>. And amid&s;t all the Trials and Temptations to the contrary, he held fa&s;t <HI>the Profe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, without Waver|ing.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. It may intend his keeping the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Faith, or of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>And this he kept, as he con&s;tantly maintained the Truth of it again&s;t all Gain&s;ayers. And as he pro|pagated the Go&s;pel, by his Preaching, &amp; by his Epi&s;|tles; &s;o he confirmed the &s;ame, not only with the

&s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;onings; but by divers Signs and Mi|racles, and Gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t. He made full Proof of his Mini&s;try, preaching the Word <HI>in Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with Power.</HI></P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="3">3. Some under&s;tand the <HI>Grace</HI> of Faith here.</P>
<P>And &s;o he kept the Faith, as he continued his Faith and Tru&s;t in God, and in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He believed on him with all his Heart. He accepted of Chri&s;t as his only Saviour, and looked for Deliverance from all Condemnation on|ly in and through him; believing as he &s;aid, <HI>That there is no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> He looked for Ju&s;tification, not from his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but from the free Grace of God, <HI>through the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He depended al&s;o upon him, for all Grace and &s;pi|ritual Strength, that he &s;tood in need of; acknow|ledging that it was <HI>through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening him, he could do all Things;</HI> and that of him&s;elf he <HI>was not &s;ufficient &s;o much as for a good Thought.</HI> In a Word, he gives this Account of him&s;elf, Gal. ii. 20. <HI>I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fle&s;h, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI></P>
<P>And he kept this Faith, continued in it firm and &s;teddy to the End; and he grew &s;trong in it, whereby he gave Glory to God, and gained a Vic|tory over the World; and when Death it &s;elf ap|proached, it did by no Means fail; but he triumphed over all the Pears and Terrors of it, <HI>knowing in whom he had believed.</HI></P>
<P>And now we mu&s;t thus <HI>keep the Faith.</HI> We mu&s;t continue in our Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and of his Go&s;pel. We mu&s;t continue in a firm and un&s;haken Belief of the Go&s;pel, <HI>the Faith that was once deliver|ed
<PB N="17" REF="004196_0051_1003FE0D9494B510">
to the Saints.</HI> And we mu&s;t, as we <HI>believe in God, believe al&s;o in Chri&s;t.</HI> And we mu&s;t watch and pray, that our Faith fail not; and mu&s;t re&s;olve that nothing &s;hall di&s;courage, or break us off from our Faith in him; that altho' <HI>he &s;lay us, yet we will tru&s;t in him.</HI> We <HI>mu&s;t tru&s;t in him at all Times,</HI> and <HI>in the Shadow of his Wings, we mu&s;t make our Refuge.</HI> We mu&s;t tru&s;t to the Merits of his Obedience &amp; Death, to the Prevalency of his Interce&s;&s;ion, to the Rich|ne&s;s and Freene&s;s of divine Grace; and we mu&s;t be influenced by &s;uch a Faith, to all Love, Holine&s;s and Obedience; and mu&s;t continue in &s;uch a Faith, even unto the Death, if we would receive <HI>the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have gone through the &s;econd gene|ral Head, even the Apo&s;tle's Reflection upon the pa&s;t Conduct of him&s;elf, in the Cour&s;e of his Life; and happy he, and happy every Man, that upon an impartial Review of his Life, is able to give &s;uch a Te&s;timony of it; <HI>That he has fought the good Fight, fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e, and kept the Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III.

<P>The Apo&s;tle was upon the Brink of both Worlds. He had pa&s;&s;ed thro' this World, &amp; was leaving it; and was ju&s;t entring upon the Borders of the other. And as with one Eye, he looks back to &s;ee what he had done, how he had behaved in his pa&s;t Life; &s;o with the other, he looks forward to &s;ee what he was to receive in the future. And as he had the Te&s;ti|mony of his Con&s;cience, as to his pa&s;t Life; &s;o he
<PB N="18" REF="004196_0052_1003FE11B959F220">
had mo&s;t joyful Expectations in the Life that was to come. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. He argues with him&s;elf, that &s;ince he had fought the good Fight, and fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e &s;o well; all which remained now, was to <HI>receive the Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Here he &s;eems to carry on the Allu&s;ion to the ancient Games, and proceeds in the <HI>agoni&s;tick Stile.</HI> For as the Victors, in tho&s;e Combats or Racings, received a Laurel, a Crown upon their Winning it, accord|ing to the Rules of tho&s;e Games; which was given to them by one appointed to judge and determine whether they had won it, or no: So the Apo&s;tle having fought the Good Fight, and run his Race, he is a&s;&s;ured, that there is a glorious <HI>Crown laid up for him, which the righteous Judge would give him at that Day, and not to him only, but to them al&s;o that love his Appearing.</HI> He had the Te&s;timony of his Con&s;cience, that he had acted his Part well; and &s;o doubted not, but that he had the Approbation of his Judge; and all he expected now was to receive the Token of it, in the glorious Crown before him. Here are &s;everal Things proper to be taken notice of, with &s;ome Enlargement, was there Time for it.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Name</HI> he gives to that Reward, he &s;ays was laid up for him, viz. <HI>A Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Crowns are &s;et upon the Heads of Emperors and Kings in Token of their regal Dignity, and Power, and Glory; accordingly a Crown is an Emblem or Token of very high Honour and Dignity; &s;o that when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, there was laid up for him a <HI>Crown,</HI> it was as much as to &s;ay, that he had by a patient Continuance in Well-doing, been &s;eeking for <HI>Glory, Honour</HI> and <HI>Immortality.</HI> He believed it was laid up for him, and that he &s;hould receive it.

which would be conferred upon &s;uch whom the <HI>King</HI> of Heaven <HI>delighted to honour.</HI> And hence, &s;ometimes it is called <HI>a Crown of Glory,</HI> and a <HI>Crown of Life</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r v. 4.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That Righteou&s;ne&s;s would be his Crown.</HI></P>
<P>And as Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s was the Glory with which our Nature was crowned, and adorned at fir&s;t; (this being a great Part of the Image of God upon the Soul of Man) &s;o it will mo&s;t certainly be the &s;pecial and peculiar Glory of the Saints in Heaven; that they are made perfect in Holine&s;s. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> may be intended, a Crown purcha&s;ed and procured <HI>by the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> even by his Obedience and Death, which has unbarred the Gates of Heaven, and opened all the Glory and Happine&s;s thereof unto us, and made Way for our obtaining it, by Virtue thereof. Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Rewards of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>A Reward to be be&s;towed upon righteous Men. For as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, P&s;al. lviii. 11. <HI>Verily, there is a Reward for the Righteous.</HI> And that in keeping the Commandments, <HI>there is a great Reward,</HI> P&s;alm xix. 11. Which Reward is not to be reckoned of Debt, but of Grace. Or,</P>
<P N="4">4. By the Crown's being called <HI>a Crown of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> we may under&s;tand, <HI>that Glory and Happi|ne&s;s which of Right belongs to all the Saints, according to the Tenor of the Go&s;pel-Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>For altho' it be a Reward not of Debt, but of free Grace; yet by Virtue of the Covenant, and Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, to which the Saints are in|titled; it may be called a Reward, or a Crown of
<PB N="20" REF="004196_0054_1003FAA44514EF10">
<HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> For God of his free Grace, has by his Word &amp; Promi&s;e, transferred a <HI>Right</HI> to them. Hence it is &s;aid to the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> Rev. xxii. 14. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life.</HI></P>
<P>But which Way &s;oever we under&s;tand the Apo&s;|tle, it comes to the &s;ame Thing; for that which is intended by it, is the Glory and the Happine&s;s of the other World, that will be conferred upon all the &s;incere Saints, and faithful Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is worthy of our Remark, <HI>from whom</HI> the Apo&s;tle expected to <HI>receive this Reward, this Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> namely, <HI>from the Lord, the righ|teous Judge.</HI></P>
<P>That is the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is con&s;tituted the Judge of the World; the Son of God, to whom the Father <HI>hath given Authority to execute Judgment, becau&s;e he is the Son of Man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John v. 27.</NOTE>. And he is a righ|teous Judge: For unto the Son, he &s;aith, <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a Scepter of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, is the Scepter of thy Kingdom</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And this was he whom the Apo&s;tle believed in with all his Heart, had preached to the World, had faithfully &s;erved; and laid him&s;elf out with mo&s;t indefatigable Diligence, to promote his Intere&s;t, and advance his Honour. From him, I &s;ay, it was that the Apo&s;tle expected to receive a glorious Reward.</P>
<P>And how great and glorious a Crown may we &s;uppo&s;e him to expect from &s;uch <HI>a plentiful Rewar|der;</HI> con&s;idering how ardently he loved him, how faithfully he &s;erved him, how much he denied him|&s;elf for his Sake, what Sufferings he had already
<PB N="21" REF="004196_0055_1003FE2967EE4658">
endured, and con&s;idering that he was now about to lay down his Life in his Cau&s;e?</P>
<P N="3">3. We may con&s;ider the <HI>Manner</HI> in which he expected to receive this Crown, viz. <HI>By Way of Gift. Which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give me.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' he had been &s;o faithfully &s;erving Chri&s;t, and was now ready to die for him, rather than de|ny him. And altho' he expected a very glorious Reward, yet he has no Apprehen&s;ion of Merit in all this. He don't look upon him&s;elf as having merited the lea&s;t of what he expected. For if he was a di&s;tingui&s;h'd Saint, yet he knew who it was that made him to differ; and <HI>that it was by the Grace of God that he was what he was:</HI> and that if he <HI>laboured more abundantly than the other</HI> Apo&s;tles, <HI>it was not HE, but the Grace of God that was with him</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 10.</NOTE>. And as he looked upon all he had already, as what he had received freely from God; &s;o what he expected further, he looked upon as a free Gift; not what he had merited by all his Services and Sufferings, but what would be freely given him. Indeed he looks for it, as what was promi&s;ed and &s;ecured to him by the Go&s;pel-Covenant; but not as what his Services had merited. And &s;o the Apo&s;tle di&s;tingui&s;heth between the Rewards of Sin, and the Rewards of Righteou&s;ne&s;s: One he calls Wages, the other a Gift. <HI>The</HI> Wages <HI>of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE>.</P>

He was full in the Belief of the Re&s;urrection of the Body, of the Judgment to come, and of the future State; and died in the confident Expecta|tion hereof; believing there was a Crown laid up for him, which at the Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t and the Judgment that follows upon it, he &s;hould re|ceive.

<P N="5">5. To ob&s;erve, <HI>The full Per&s;wa&s;ion and confident Expectation</HI> the Apo&s;tle had of <HI>receiving this glorious Crown.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004196_0057_1003FE3658AE9E68">He &s;peaks of it with an A&s;&s;urance; <HI>Henceforth, there IS laid up for me a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge WILL give me.</HI> He was fully per&s;waded of this, there was no Doubt or Uncertainty remaining in his Mind about the Matter; but he &s;eems to be well a&s;&s;ured of it, as the Racers were of the Laurel, or the Crown they &s;aw hung up at the End of the Race. And with &s;uch &s;ure and certain Hopes, with &s;uch &s;trong and lively Pro&s;pects of a glorious Crown; he is enabled to receive the Ma&s;&s;ages of Death with all Calmne&s;s and Courage, has all his natural Fears of Death &s;cattered, and with Plea&s;ure thinks of his Depar|ture, which was &s;o near at Hand.</P>
<P>And this is the happy Privilege of &s;ome of God's eminent Saints and Servants: They have &s;uch clear Evidences of their being in a State of Grace, and &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for them; that they can, not only die in Peace, but are able even to rejoyce at &s;uch a Time, in Hope of that Glory there is now re&s;erved in Heaven for them, and &s;hall in due Time be re|vealed in them.</P>
<P N="6">6 Let me further ob&s;erve, <HI>The plea&s;ing Thought</HI> the Apo&s;tle had at this Time, with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Salvation and Happine&s;s of others,</HI> as well as his own.</P>
<P>Was he &s;o Selfi&s;h as to think and plea&s;e him&s;elf with the Thoughts of a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Glory far none but him&s;elf? Was he for mo|nopolizing the Glory and Happine&s;s of Heaven, as &s;ome Men would the Riches and Honours of the pre&s;ent World? No, but plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the Thought that this World would be the happy Lot and Portion of all true Believers, as well as of him|&s;elf. <HI>And not to me only, but to them al&s;o that love
<PB N="24" REF="004196_0058_1003FE41694B26D8">
his Appearing.</HI> He did not look upon the Crown as belonging only to him, or as if he was the only one that &s;hould receive a Reward; but that others, even all that loved the Appearance of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be Partakers with him in the future Glory and Felicity.</P>
<P>And here is the Difference between tho&s;e that run the chri&s;tian Race, and the Racers among the Grecians or Romans: For in their Racings, there was but one that gained the Prize; altho' many ran, and &s;trove for it. <HI>Know ye not that they which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor ix. 24.</NOTE>? Whereas in the chri&s;tian Race, all that run with Patience and Per&s;everance, &s;hall obtain the Prize, the Crown of eternal Life. And this Thought, in|&s;tead of being any Abatement of his Plea&s;ure, was a great Addition to it: It plea&s;ed him that others &s;hould be as &s;urely, and as gloriou&s;ly rewarded as he; according to their Services and Faith.</P>
<P>He had his Soul enlarged in Love to his Fellow-Creatures; he wi&s;hed, and prayed, and longed, and laid him&s;elf out to the utmo&s;t, for their Conver&s;ion and Salvation. He tells us, Rom. x. 1. <HI>That it was his Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael, that they might be &s;aved.</HI> And &s;o earne&s;t &amp; ardent were his De&s;ires for the Salvation of his People, as to carry him beyond Bounds, and to expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;uch an hyperbolical Manner, (as is thought) in Rom. ix. 3. <HI>I could wi&s;h that my &s;elf were accur|&s;ed,</HI> or &s;eparated, <HI>from Chri&s;t, for my Brethren my Kin&s;men according to the Fle&s;h.</HI> And how &s;ollicitous was he, that they and others, might believe and be &s;aved? In &s;o much, that he even <HI>travailed in Birth that Chri&s;t might be formed in them</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE>. He preach|ed,
<PB N="25" REF="004196_0059_1003FE44E46F9360">
he taught, he warned, he exhorted every Man, in all Wi&s;dom, labouring and &s;triving according to the Power and Grace of God given to him; and what was it for? but <HI>that he might pre&s;ent every Man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 28.</NOTE>. And well might he think of it with Plea&s;ure; that not only he, but that all true Believers &s;hould receive &s;uch unfading Crowns of Glory from the Lord their righteous Judge.</P>
<P>And this is the Temper of every true Saint: Their Souls are not only elevated into a &s;upreme Love of God, but enlarged in a &s;incere and fervent Charity to all the Saints; and it will plea&s;e every Saint to think that others will, as well as they receive tho&s;e Marks of divine Honour, and Favour; and that they &s;hall join together, even innumerable Companies of Saints and Angels, in &s;houting forth the Prai&s;es of God, and the Lamb for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. I have but one Word more to add here; and that is, the Apo&s;tle's <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of tho&s;e for whom this Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s was laid up, as well as for him&s;elf, viz. <HI>Such as love his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>There is the Appearing of the Lord, the righte-Judge, before mentioned. So that one Part of the Character of a true Chri&s;tian, of one that is intitled to a Crown, is that he loves the Appearance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to Judgment. As for the Hypocrite, and the Sinner, he dreads the Appearance of him. What a Terror is it to &s;uch to think of Appearing before him, <HI>who&s;e Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, who &s;earches the Hearts, and tries the Reins of the Chil|dren of Men, that he may render to every Man accord|ing to his Works; before whom all Things are open
<PB N="26" REF="004196_0060_1003FE4DB8B93D80">
and naked, and who will judge the Secrets of Men.</HI> For &s;uch can't but be apprehen&s;ive of the Shame and Confu&s;ion that will cover them when they ap|pear before his inlightened Tribunal, &amp; &s;hall have all their Sins, even their mo&s;t &s;ecret Wickedne&s;s, laid open to the World; and they &s;hall have the Reward of their Deeds rendred to them.</P>
<P>But now the real Chri&s;tian who&s;e Con&s;cience can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tify for him with the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, that <HI>he had fought the good Fight,</HI> &amp;c. or can appeal to God with good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and done that which is good in thy Sight</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xx. 3.</NOTE>. I &s;ay &s;uch will love and rejoyce at the Appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He will be glad there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Day coming wherein he may give up his Ac|count to God, if his Con&s;cience tells him, that he has glorified God on Earth, and fini&s;hed the Work that he had given him to do. Glad that there will be an Opportunity to vindicate him&s;elf of the ill Thoughts, the hard Speeches and Reproaches that have been ca&s;t upon him; to have his Sincerity and Uprightne&s;s, his Fidelity and Diligence in the Service of Chri&s;t, acknowleged and approved by his Judge; and to receive the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Euge</HI> to his immortal Honour before the World.</P>
<P>Thus every true Chri&s;tian has Rea&s;on to love the Appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for when <HI>he who is their Life &s;hall appear, they al&s;o &s;hall appear with him in Glory</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Col. iii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And thus I have ha&s;tily gone over my <HI>Text,</HI> and the Subject was too large and copious to do any thing more than hint at Things, in the Compa&s;s of Time allowed me. And what I now ha&s;ten to is the</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>And here I &s;hall only mention two or three In|ferences, that are the mo&s;t obvious, and will be mo&s;t agreeable to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Infer. I. <HI>What an un&s;peakable Mercy is it, &s;ince there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of Dying; that there is any thing to &s;upport and comfort us under the certain Pro&s;|pects and near Approaches of it.</HI></P>
<P>Death in it &s;elf con&s;idered is an awful Change, and carries a great deal of Terror along with it. Nature abhors and relucts at a Di&s;&s;olution. It is a very affecting Thing to go off the Stage of Life, and pa&s;s into a State of Silence, and Inactivity. It is a very melancholly Thing to take the final Leave of our Families and Friends, our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and Enjoyments; &amp; to leave the Places that now know us, to know us no more forever.</P>
<P>And if we are utterly in the Dark as to our fu|ture State, it mu&s;t needs be very perplexing to the Mind. But, O what Di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t the Man be in, who has no better a Pro&s;pect before him, but that of a mi&s;erable Eternity! That when Death ap|proaches, and when all worldly Pro&s;pects fail; that there <HI>&s;hould nothing remain to him, but a fearful look|ing for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour him!</HI></P>
<P>But now what an un&s;peakable Mercy do the Saints enjoy; that they have &s;uch Cordials, &s;uch Supports &amp; Comforts, at the Approaches of Death, as the Te&s;timony of their Con&s;ciences, the Wit|ne&s;s of God's Spirit, the Light of his Countenance, and the Joy of his Salvation? Such &s;ure and certain Pro&s;pects of a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, that in&s;tead of be|ing &s;urprized or terrified at Death, it is Matter of
<PB N="28" REF="004196_0062_1003FA97B2B22A28">
Joy to them, and in&s;tead of &s;hrinking back at the Approach of it, they are able to welcome the King of Terrors, and in holy Triumph, to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56. <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin; and the Strength of Sin is the Law. But Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Infer. II. We learn, <HI>That it is the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, with Re&s;pect to our pa&s;t Carriage and Conduct in the World, that will afford &s;olid Com|fort in a dying Hour.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>this</HI> that enabled the Apo&s;tle, to think, and &s;peak, and write &s;o calmly of Death; and to plea&s;e him&s;elf with the confident Expectation of a future Reward. And it is only &s;uch a Te&s;timony of Con&s;cience for us, that will take away the Ter|ror, and the Sting of Death: And truly without this, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to have any Peace at the Approach of Death. What Peace or Comfort can that Man have who is con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that he has lived in the Neglect of God, and of his Duty to him, of his being unju&s;t in his Dealings, unfaith|ful to his Tru&s;t, unkind, uncha&s;te or intemperate in his Life? How will &s;uch a guilty Soul be filled with Di&s;tre&s;s &amp; Terror at the Approach of Death, knowing that this will open the Scene of eternal Wo and Mi&s;ery unto him?</P>
<P>Whereas &s;uch as upon the clo&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t im|partial Reflection upon them&s;elves, can &s;ay they <HI>have fought the good Fight;</HI> that they have waged War with all their &s;piritual Enemies; and have through the Grace and Strength of Chri&s;t gotten the Ma&s;tery of them; that they have run their chri&s;tian Race with Patience; that they hold fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion, and the Exerci&s;e of their Faith with|out
<PB N="29" REF="004196_0063_1003FE60ABDE06B8">
Wavering, they will have a &s;ure foundation for Peace and Comfort in the Hour of Death. For what can do a Man any Hurt that is in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? God and Chri&s;t are for him; the Go&s;pel, and all the exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es thereof, are on his Side; and then, who or what can be again&s;t him.</P>
<P>So that it is according as our Con&s;ciences te&s;tify for, or again&s;t us; that we &s;hall have Hope or Fear, Joy or Sorrow, in a dying Hour. <HI>For if our Hearts condemn us, God is greater than our Heart, and knoweth all Things. But if our Heart condemn us not, then may we have Confidence towards God<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 20, 21.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>Infer. III. <HI>How &s;afe and happy mu&s;t the true Chri&s;|tian needs be in Death; &s;ince there is a Crown of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s laid up for him, which the Lord the righte|ous Judge will give him at the Day of his Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>Well might the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>that to die was Gain</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Phil i. 21</NOTE>, &s;ince that was the Way to a glorious Crown; and it is through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death, that all the Saints do a&s;cend to Glory. That Man who while he lives, lives to the Lord, and when he dies, dies in the Lord; who can take away his Crown? It is &s;ecured to him by the Pow|er, and by the Promi&s;es of God, <HI>all which are in Chri&s;t yea, and in him Amen.</HI> Wherefore we may all write, as in Rev. xiv. 13. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>And now, this we have Rea&s;on to think was the happy Ca&s;e of an aged Saint among us, who was

the la&s;t Night interred, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e Temper and Carri|age in his private Station in the World was &s;uch, as gives us good Ground to hope, there was a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s laid up for him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr</HI> John Dick&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But what abundant Rea&s;on have we to think &s;o, with Re&s;pect to the worthy and honourable, good and faithful PRESIDENT of the College; who has lately taken his Departure from us by Death?</P>
<P>His Life and Conver&s;ation from his Youth up, have been a con&s;tant Te&s;timony for him, to all that knew him, of the excellent good Di&s;po&s;itions of his Mind, and of the gracious Impre&s;&s;ions upon his Heart from his tender Years. He like King <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> while he was yet young, began to &s;eek and &s;erve the God of his Fathers.</P>
<P>He was favoured with a liberal Education at the College, (over which he was afterwards called to pre&s;ide): And when a Student there, he behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much Inoffen&s;ivene&s;s, Dutifulne&s;s, and Diligence, as not only to gain the Love and Good-Will of all, but their Re&s;pect and E&s;teem as a good Proficient in the Learning of <HI>that Day.</HI></P>
<P>Since which he has been imploying his natural and acquired Accompli&s;hments, with a Diligence, Con&s;tancy and Fidelity, that was uncommon.</P>
<P>But few Men had more u&s;eful Talents, or Accompli&s;hments better fitted for doing Service in the World, than he.</P>
<P>He had a calm and moderate Temper, and had a great Government of his Pa&s;&s;ions; but with all, had &s;trong and &s;teddy Spirits, which would prompt him to undertake, and would carry him through many difficult Labours, without Fainting or giving
<PB N="31" REF="004196_0065_1003FE71F553C778">
over. He was very meek and peaceable, humble, conde&s;cending and familiar to all. He was not of a ha&s;ty Spirit, that would precipitate him to any ra&s;h or unadvi&s;ed Actions; but in all Affairs, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e that were difficult and doubtful, he acted with great Caution.</P>
<P>And altho' where his Con&s;cience was concerned, (which he always appeared to be under the Go|vernment of,) he would &s;teddily and courageou&s;ly abide by the Dictates thereof, whether he plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed Men; for this was his governing Princi|ple, to manage in all his Affairs, not as plea&s;ing Men but God, that trieth the Hearts.</P>
<P>And yet in other Ca&s;es, no Man more careful not to di&s;plea&s;e or offend. Accordingly in his Di&s;|cour&s;es, whether private or publick, he for the mo&s;t part avoided controver&s;ial Points, and Mat|ters of doubtful Di&s;putation; choo&s;ing rather to pre&s;s tho&s;e practical Duties that were not di&s;puted, than &s;pend his Time in &s;peculative Controver&s;ies. He was a Lover, and a Coun&s;eller of Peace; and &s;tudied the Things that made for Peace, and where|by one might edify another.</P>
<P>He &s;pent about <HI>thirty Years</HI> of his Life in the publick Mini&s;try at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where he was happy in the hearty Love and Re&s;pects of his People; and where he diligently, and I believe &s;ucce&s;sfully laid him&s;elf out for the good of Souls, in his pa&s;toral Vi&s;its, as well as in his publick Preaching; and &s;hewed him&s;elf a Pattern of good Works, readily di&s;tributing the Tenth of all his Income to pious and charitable U&s;es, whereby he could with greater Cou|rage and Confidence call upon others for their Cha|rities; and did by his own Example provoke them to Love and to good Works.</P>
<P>Furthermore, He endeavoured that his publick Mini&s;try &s;hould be of more exten&s;ive Service; by
<PB N="32" REF="004196_0066_1003FE737812C450">
the many Sermons, and other Di&s;cour&s;es which he publi&s;hed; in all of which he u&s;ed great Plainne&s;s of Speech, level'd to the lowe&s;t Capacities, more am|bitious to in&s;truct and quicken others, than to gain Applau&s;e to him&s;elf; in which Writings, altho' he be dead, yet he &s;peaks to us; and as they have been, &s;o I doubt not, but that they will be a Guide and Comfort to many Souls.</P>
<P>It is now almo&s;t <HI>twelve Years</HI> &s;ince he was cho&s;en into the Pre&s;ident&s;hip, and accepted the Care and Burden of that important Office; not for the Ho|nour, or the Profit of the Place; but as he has often declared, from a &s;elf-denying Spirit, and in Obedience to what he apprehended to be the Call of God unto him.</P>
<P>And as he came hither for the Good of the Col|lege; &s;o he laid him&s;elf out very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ligently, and la|boriou&s;ly for that End; endeavouring to train up the Youth in &s;uch a Way, as he apprehended would render them mo&s;t Serviceable in their Day; being concerned to rectify their Morals, to reform their Di&s;orders; and to promote true &s;ub&s;tantial Piety, as well as the mo&s;t u&s;eful Learning, among them.</P>
<P>And altho' he has for the greate&s;t Part of his Pre&s;ident&s;hip been afflicted and &s;ore broken; yet it has been wonderful to us all, to ob&s;erve, not only with what Patience he endured his Pains; (which for Years together, except when in Bed, were almo&s;t con&s;tant upon him.) But with what Diligence and Care he applied him&s;elf to the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the College, under &s;o much bodily Weak|ne&s;s. For altho' this Weakne&s;s grew upon him, yet he held out, in the con&s;tant Service of his Place, even almo&s;t unto the very la&s;t. So that I have often thought, that many other Men, for the &s;ame Degree of Pain and Weakne&s;s, would keep their Chamber, if not their Bed; when he would
<PB N="33" REF="004196_0067_1003FE789FB4FD38">
go forth to College, and carry on the Wor&s;hip of the Hall.</P>
<P>In a Word, and to &s;um up all; He was one of the brighte&s;t Examples of Diligence, Con&s;tancy and Fidelity.</P>
<P>And when he apprehended his Departure to be at Hand, he was in the &s;ame happy Frame with the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle. He had his Con&s;cience wit|ne&s;&s;ing for him, that he <HI>had fought the good Fight, fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e, and kept the Faith;</HI> which gave him a Calm and Quietne&s;s of Mind; yea, and filled him with joyful Expectations of <HI>a Crown of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and with admiring and adoring Thank|fulne&s;s to God, for his abundant Mercy through Chri&s;t, in begetting &s;uch lively Hopes within him; telling me at one Time, how deeply and frequent|ly he was affected with tho&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle, 1 Peter i. 3,&mdash; 9. &s;aying, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which according to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope, by the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the Dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible, and unde|filed, and that fadeth not away re&s;erved, in Heaven for you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now, who is there that has &s;een &amp; known <HI>his Manner of Life</HI> among us, his <HI>Doctrine, Purpo&s;e, Long-&s;uffering, Charity, Patience,</HI> and are Witne&s;&s;es how <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lily, ju&s;tly &amp; unblameably</HI> he behaved him&s;elf; that can po&s;&s;ibly doubt of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for him?

a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give him, at <HI>the Day</HI> of his Appearing.</P>
<P>And now what remains, but that we duly re&s;ent this bereaving Stroke of divine Providence, and make a wi&s;e Improvement of it?</P>
<P>And in a particular Manner, let the <HI>College</HI> be deeply affected with the Breach that God in his holy and &s;overeign Providence has made upon it.</P>
<P>May <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> who have the <HI>immediate In&s;truction and Government of that Society,</HI> be excited and quick|ened to be more and more imitating their Ma&s;ter that is taken from their Head, in Diligence, Con|&s;tancy and Fidelity; a&s;piring after a double Portion of that good Spirit that was in him.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>Students,</HI> the Sons of the Prophets, call to mind the &s;olemn, earne&s;t and affectionate Coun&s;els, Exhortations and Warnings, that you have heard from his Mouth; and may his Prayers and Tears upon your Account, which you have &s;een and heard, come into your more &s;erious Re|membrance.

<P>May the bereaved <HI>Family</HI> be &s;upported under this heavy Lo&s;s, and have it &s;anctify'd unto them. May the <HI>Widow</HI> have the Con&s;olations of God which are not &s;mall, and rejoyce in having the Lord her Maker for her Husband.</P>

<P>May <HI>mourning Friends and Relatives</HI> be comfort|ed to think of the happy Exchange it has proved to him.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words are Part of a Parable &s;po|ken by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to his Di&s;ci|ples, when the Time of his Departure from this World, and of his A&s;cen&s;ion to his Father began to draw near.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of the Parable &s;eems to be to &s;et forth the different Demeanour of tho&s;e, who bear the Name of the Servants of Chri&s;t, and receive valuable Betru&s;tments from him, in this World; and the &s;uitable Difference he will make in his Treatment of them; when <HI>he &s;hall come in his Glo|ry,</HI> at the Day of Judgment, <HI>and all the holy Angels with him.</HI> It will then be found, that &s;ome of the Servants of Chri&s;t have well improved the <HI>Talents</HI>

he delivered to them; and the&s;e he will both com|mend and reward: While others who have been his Servants by Vocation, external Profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;pecial De&s;ignation as well as they; will neverthe|le&s;s appear to have made an ill U&s;e of their Lord's <HI>Goods;</HI> or at lea&s;t not to have improved them to any valuable Purpo&s;e: And the&s;e he will cen&s;ure as <HI>Wicked and Slothful,</HI> and doom them to <HI>outer Darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>My Text contains the Words of our Lord to a Servant of the fir&s;t Sort, who was able to give a good and a joyful Account of him&s;elf, and of what his Lord had delivered to him. <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Thou delivered&s;t unto me five Talents; behold, I have gained be&s;ides them five Talents more.</HI> He humbly acknowleges that he had improved nothing, but what he had received from Chri&s;t his Lord. Tho' his Stock had been large, compar'd with that of his Fellow-Servants; yet it was not his own, but Chri&s;t's. Thine the Talents were, and thou ho|noured&s;t me by committing them to my Tru&s;t. And then he appeals to Chri&s;t as a Witne&s;s of his Dili|gence, Faithfulne&s;s and Succe&s;s in improving them. That as he had received much, &s;o he had been careful to return the more; and to make his Im|provements proportionable to his Receivings: <HI>Behold, I have gained be&s;ides them five Talents more.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it a fooli&s;h Confidence of Boa&s;ting, but the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, that he had obtained Mercy to be faithful, which gives him this Boldne&s;s in the Day of Judgment; for Chri&s;t him&s;elf admits the Truth of his Account, and ap|plauds and rewards his Faithfulne&s;s and Diligence; &s;aying unto him as in my Text, <HI>well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou ha&s;t been faithful o|ther a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many

Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> Upon which we may ob&s;erve this Doctrine,</P>
<P><HI>That the&s;e Servants of Chri&s;t, who have faithfully improved the Talents he delivered to them, &s;hall be highly applauded, and gloriou&s;ly rewarded by him.</HI></P>
<P>For the Illu&s;tration of this Truth, I &s;hall do four Things: viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider what may be meant by the Ta|lents delivered to the Servants of Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>I &s;hall &s;how, that it is Chri&s;t who delivers the&s;e Talents to his Servants.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>4. <HI>That they &s;hall be gloriou&s;ly rewarded by him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to con&s;ider, what may be meant by the Talents delivered to the Servants of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And here I may &s;ay in general, <HI>That every Thing improveable by them to the Honour of God, or to the Good of others, or of their own Souls is a Talent.</HI> It is a valuable Trea&s;ure, which if the Fault be not their own, may become of ine&s;timable Advantage to them; for as much as by a right U&s;e of it, they may be <HI>laying up in Store for them&s;elves a good Foundation a|gain&s;t the Time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal Life</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tim vi. 19</NOTE>. In this View we may con&s;ider, the Endow|ments of their Minds; the Health &amp; Strength &amp; Vigour of their Bodies; their worldly Enjoyments, E&s;tate, Education, Credit, Intere&s;t, Power, Preferments; the Word and Ordinances of God, and Motions of the good Spirit of Grace; and all the Opportu|nities, or even Occa&s;ions of doing or receiving
<PB N="4" REF="004196_0075_10041947A2539900">
&s;piritual Good; as &s;o many Talents committed to their Tru&s;t. By a right U&s;e of any of the&s;e, they may be doing acceptable Service to God; and by a Mi&s;improvement, at a bare Neglect of them, they may incur the Guilt of Sloth and Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>How much then does it concern us all, to walk cir|cum&s;pectly, not as Fools, but as Wi&s;e; &s;ince there is hardly any Thing can occur to us &s;o indifferent in its own Nature, but that it may mini&s;ter an Occa&s;ion of doing, what may recommend us to the Favour, or ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> us to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God, and &s;o may affect our eternal Intere&s;ts?</HI>&mdash; It is ju&s;t Matter of Rejoycing to con&s;ider, that the mo&s;t Common of our outward Enjoyments may be &s;o ordered, as to be of everla&s;ting Advantage to us: That our very Food and Drink may be received in &s;uch a Manner, as that God will account him&s;elf glorified thereby. But then we have Rea&s;on to rejoyce with Trembling, when we take a Pro&s;pect of the Danger on the other Side: How that by any Mi&s;improvement of the&s;e Things, or only by neglecting to glorify God with them, we &s;hall incur his Di&s;plea&s;ure, and trea&s;ure up Wrath to our &s;elves. Since then we have &s;uch an Advantage, and &s;uch a Danger continually before us; how tho'tful and vigilant ought we always to be? And what Manner of Per&s;ons in all holy Con|ver&s;ation and Godline&s;s? E&s;pecially if we con|&s;ider, what I am to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That it is Chri&s;t who delivers to his Servants all the Talents they are betru&s;ted with.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this is fairly hinted in the Parable now before us; the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ver 14</NOTE> fir&s;t Ver&s;e of which, I think,
<PB N="5" REF="004196_0076_1004194F07C31750">
ought to be read, not as in our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lati|on, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is;</HI> but, <HI>The Son of Man is</HI> as a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods. And unto one he gave five Ta|lents, to another two, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When our ble&s;&s;ed Lord a&s;cended up on high, he received Gifts for Men; had all Things put under his Feet; and was made to be the Head over all Things to the Church <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxviii. 18. Eph. i. 22.</NOTE>. The Admini&s;tration therefore of the Kingdom of Providence and of Grace, is now in his Hand. So that we are to look upon all the Abilities, Advantages, Occa&s;ions and Opportunities we have of doing or receiving Good, as &s;o many Talents committed to our Tru&s;t <HI>by him,</HI> who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a pecu|liar People, zealous of good Works <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tirus ii. 14.</NOTE>: <HI>By him,</HI> who will call us to an Account in the great Day of Rec|koning, and be our Judge to determine our ever|la&s;ting State, according as we have made a good or bad U&s;e of the&s;e Talents of Tru&s;t and Confidence repo&s;ed in us.</P>
<P><HI>Let us then con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly with what Strictne&s;s and Exactne&s;s, and tender Re&s;entments, we may well expect he will take an Account of the Number and the Nature and the Degree of the good Things which be him&s;elf hath committed to us.</HI>&mdash;As he was the Be&s;tower of them, he cannot but know exactly what they were. And as they were Part of the Purcha&s;e of his Blood, and of the Reward of his Obe|dience unto Death, and were committed by him to us as Marks of Honour and Confidence, to be im|proved
<PB N="6" REF="004196_0077_1003FAD6AA09EEB0">
for our eternal Benefit, he cannot but be mo&s;t tenderly affected with the U&s;e we make of them. With what Plea&s;ure &amp; Satisfaction mu&s;t he look upon us, if we faithfully improve them to the ble&s;&s;ed Purpo&s;es for which he purchas'd &amp; be&s;towed them. And with what Indignation, if we neglect them as Things not worthy of our Notice or Improvement?</P>
<P><HI>The Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things &s;hould be a mo&s;t powerful and prevailing Argument with every one of us to inquire frequently with great Care and Sollicitude, into his own State and Circum&s;tances; that he may know what is his Duty, and what are the Expectati|ons of his Lord from him.</HI> &mdash; Without &s;uch an In|quiry, we &s;hall either not know, or at lea&s;t not con&s;ider what Talents Chri&s;t hath delivered to us. And &s;o far as we are ignorant or tho'tle&s;s of this, it is certain we &s;hall be &s;carele&s;s and &s;lothful and wicked Servants; and have but a wretched Account to give up to our Ma&s;ter at the Day of Reckoning. And as our Circum&s;tan|ces are often varying, &s;o our Opportunities and Ad|vantages for doing Honour to God, and Service to our Generation, are often changing with them, which makes it needful that our Inquiries &s;hould be frequent: And very &s;ollicitous we have all the Rea&s;on in the World to be, to obtain a good Under|&s;tanding in the&s;e Things; becau&s;e our U&s;efulne&s;s in this World, and our Happine&s;s in the next, &s;o much depend upon our Knowledge of them; and becau&s;e our Lord him&s;elf will take &s;uch an exact Account of his own Gifts, as well as of our Improvements.</P>
<P>Let us then be per&s;waded to inquire frequently and with great Attention; what Services for God and our Generation the natural Abilities which our Lord hath given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, tender us mo&s;t fit for? An Inquiry this, of great Importance to &s;uch as (like
<PB N="7" REF="004196_0078_1004195E964A8718">
many of you) have their Cour&s;e of Life yet to choo&s;e; that they may determine upon &s;uch a one, as they will be mo&s;t likely to act in with Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction to them&s;elves, and U&s;efulne&s;s to others.</P>
<P>Again, Let us inquire, what Duties God calls us to from time to time in his Providence; by pre&s;enting Opportunities &amp; Advantages, &amp; laying Inducements before us? What Opportunities and Occa&s;ions ari&s;e out of our pre&s;ent State of Life, to te&s;tify our Fear of God, and Regard to his Servants? What to be getting Good to our &s;elves now, and what to be laying a Foundation for U&s;efulne&s;s to others here|after? What Benefits or Advantages are derived to us from the re&s;pective Relations or Capacities in which we are placed? What Incitements to a vi|gorous Application ari&s;e from our outward Circum|&s;tances, and future Hopes and Pro&s;pects? In fine, and above all, how many &s;piritual Advantages we enjoy in common with our Fellow-Servants by the external Means of Grace? And how many pecu|liar to our &s;elves by the inward Convictions, Re|&s;traints, A&s;&s;i&s;tances of that good Spirit which our departed Lord &s;endeth to us? By frequent In|quiries of this &s;ort, we &s;hall become more and more &s;en&s;ible what Talents our Lord is committing to our Tru&s;t; and of con&s;equence what we have to Im|prove here, and what to Account for hereafter. And a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things will have a happy Tendency to work us up to a fer|vour of Spirit in the Service of our Lord, and &s;o prepare us for tho&s;e Applau&s;es and Rewards which the Good and Faithful may expect from him.</P>
<P>And &s;o it may do al&s;o, to <HI>remember them who have had the Rule over us, who have &s;poken unto us the Word of God, and who&s;e Faith it concerns us to fellow, con&s;idering the End of their Conver&s;ation.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004196_0079_1003FB1C32D62130">
For every Benefit we have had Opportunity to re|ceive by their Means, ought to be con&s;idered by us as a Talent, which we mu&s;t give an Account of to Chri&s;t at his &s;econd Coming. And all their Abili|ties and Opportunities to do Service to us or others: And their Fidelity in improving them, ought thankfully to be acknowledged to the Honour of Him, who is Head over all Things to the Church; and who <HI>giveth</HI> &s;uch <HI>Gifts to Men, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me to pay Part of that Tribute which is due to the Memory of our late Reverend and worthy Pre&s;ident, who may ju&s;tly be con&s;ider|ed, if we compare his Opportunities and Abilities together, as one of tho&s;e Servants whom our Lord honours with the Care of <HI>five Talents,</HI> a large Stock in compari&s;on of what is tru&s;ted with many others.</P>
<P>He had his Education in this Hou&s;e, where I hope without Flattery it may be &s;aid, that tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed wi&s;ely to improve them, enjoy at lea&s;t as many Advantages to accompli&s;h them&s;elves for the Service of their Generation, as are to be met with in our own Country. When he pro|ceeded to &s;ettle in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, the Holy Gho&s;t made him Over&s;eer of a numerous Flock in the Metropolis of the Province, in the generality of who&s;e Affections he was ble&s;&s;ed with a very great Intere&s;t. And as this gave him a &s;ingular Advantage to promote the Good of their Souls; &s;o it evidences the Truth of their Chri&s;tian Self-denial and publick Spirit (which ought always to be remembred, and &s;poken of with Honour) in Con&s;enting to the Removal of One &s;o dear to them, to what they apprehended a Station of more gene|ral U&s;efulne&s;s and Service. And &s;o at length by the &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;al of our a&s;cended Lord, he
<PB N="9" REF="004196_0080_10041966B024A948">
was &s;et at the Head of this Society, in who&s;e Wel|fare and Pro&s;perity, both the civil and religious Intere&s;ts of the People of God in this Land are &s;o much concerned that hardly any Place can be tho't of, in which a Servant of Chri&s;t hath Oppor|tunity to be a more exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And to render him &s;uch a one in every Station, the glorious Head of the Church had given him a very capacious and faithful Memory, a &s;ound Un|der&s;tanding, a clear Apprehen&s;ion, and an uncom|mon Faculty of making religious Truths plain to the meane&s;t Capacities. But to crown all, our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t had taken an early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart of this his Servant for him&s;elf; had impre&s;&s;ed it with a mo&s;t affectionate Concern for the Souls of Men, and had given him an indefatiga|ble Spirit to pur&s;ue their Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Talents with which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord betru&s;ted his decea&s;ed Servant. But how diligently and faithfully he occupied them I &s;hall have a more proper Occa&s;ion to &s;ay under a|nother Head. I mu&s;t now proceed therefore to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That tho&s;e Servants of Chri&s;t who have faith|fully improved the Talents he delivered to them, &s;hall be highly applauded by him.</HI></P>
<P>And here I &s;hall endeavour two Things; viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To de&s;cribe the faithful Servants of Chri&s;t; or &s;hew, what Manner of Per&s;ons they are who faithfully improve the Talents he hath delivered to them.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>To prove the Truth of the Propo&s;ition; or &s;hew, that &s;uch Servants &s;hall be highly applauded by him.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who is the faithful Servant of Chri&s;t? What is his Character? Or what Manner of Per&s;on is the
<PB N="10" REF="004196_0081_1004196FAA9D06F0">
Man who faithfully improves the Talents which Chri&s;t hath delivered to him?</HI></P>
<P>To which I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That he is one who&s;e Heart is full of Affection and Devotion to his Ma&s;ter.</HI> He con&s;iders that he is not his own, but is bought with a Price: and that not of corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Chri&s;t. And there|fore he loves the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in Sincerity, who hath fir&s;t loved him, and given him&s;elf an Of|fering and a Sacrifice to God for him. If other Lords have had Dominion over him, the faithful Servant of Chri&s;t heartily repents his pa&s;t Subjec|tion to them. He renounces the Service of the Fle&s;h, the World and the Devil; breaks their Bands a&s;under, and ca&s;ts their Cords away from him. He unfeignedly acknowleges the Right of Chri&s;t to rule over him, and devotes him&s;elf entirely and forever to his Service; &s;aying as in P&s;alm cxvi. 16. <HI>Oh Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Ser|vant, and the Son of thine Handmaid. Thy Servant who is devoted to thy Fear,</HI> P&s;alm cxix. 38.</P>
<P>From this Spirit of Affection and Devotion to him, the faithful Servant of Chri&s;t becomes highly concerned for his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t and Honour, &s;ollicitous above all Things, that whether pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, he may be accepted of him; and he can take no re&s;t under the lea&s;t Sen&s;e or Doubt of his Di&s;plea&s;ure. It is his earne&s;t De&s;ire and Study to know the Will of Chri&s;t in the utmo&s;t Latitude of it, and e&s;pecially with Re&s;pect to the Duties of his own Station in particular. His great Inquiry is, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And his &s;er|vent Prayer, <HI>Teach me thy Statutes. I am thy Ser|vant give me Under&s;tanding that I may know thy Te&s;ti|monies.</HI> And it is his fixed Re&s;olution (through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening him) carefully to perform what|&s;oever
<PB N="11" REF="004196_0082_100419788C04EF50">
he does know, or &s;hall know to be his Duty Without &s;uch a Temper of Mind as this, no Man will faithfully improve the Talents which Chri&s;t hath delivered to him, but will be habitually <HI>di&s;o|bedient, and unto every good Work reprohate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A faithful Servant of Chri&s;t is one who endea|vours to extend his Obedience to the whole Compa&s;s of his Duty.</HI> It is not Faithfulne&s;s, but &s;ome other and &s;ome unworthy Principle which actuates the Man, who pretends a Zeal for Chri&s;t in &s;ome Points of Duty, and yet is knowingly Remi&s;s and Negli|gent in others: Such a Man <HI>&s;eeks his own, not the Things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's.</HI> For a &s;incere Re|gard to the Intere&s;t and Honour and Will of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be operative and influencial in one In|&s;tance as well as in another. And therefore, tho' the faithful Servant of Chri&s;t, thro' humane Infir|mity, offends and falls &s;hort of his Duty in many Things, yet it is his Grief and Lamentation that he does &s;o, and <HI>he always labours fervently that be may &s;tand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God.</HI> And <HI>then</HI> only <HI>will he not be a&s;hamed, when he hath a Re&s;pect unto all his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t is peculiarly mind|ful of the Duties of the Station and Relations in which his Lord hath &s;et him.</HI> The&s;e are emphati|cally his <HI>own Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and <HI>he &s;tudies to do it,</HI> being always tho'tful of that Precept, I Cor. vii. 17. <HI>As God hath di&s;tributed to every Man, as the Lord hath call|ed every one, &s;o let him walk.</HI> And for the &s;ame Rea|&s;on, he will al&s;o carefully lay hold of every Oppor|tunity, Advantage or Occa&s;ion ari&s;ing from the Cir|cum&s;tances in which his Lord &s;hall at any Time place him, to promote his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t and Honour, get good to his own Soul, or do good to others. For he looks upon every Opportunity and Advantage for the&s;e Things, as a Call from Chri&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="004196_0083_1004197C90B40040">
to ari&s;e and do them. And he thinks it impo&s;&s;ible for any Man to be a faithful Servant of Chri&s;t, and yet regardle&s;s of his Ma&s;ter's Calls to Duty.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t is a diligent and laborious Servant.</HI> He abhors the Character, and dreads the Cur&s;e of him, who doeth the Work of the Lord negligently. And therefore what&s;oever his Hand findeth to do, he doth it with his Might. He is not &s;lothful in Bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;ervent in Spirit &s;erving the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He is full of Patience and Re&s;ignation to his Ma&s;ter's Will under all the Afflictions with which he thinks fit in his holy Providence to exerci&s;e him.</HI> The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t don't con&s;ider Affliction as coming forth out of the Du&s;t, or Trouble as &s;pringing out of the Ground; but as &s;ent by him, who is given of God to be Head over all Things to the Church; by him who loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it: who therefore cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to afflict willingly, or grieve any of his faithful Servants, whom he hath redeemed with his Blood; but rather to cha&s;ten them for their Profit, that they may be Partakers of his Holine&s;s. That there|fore, tho' no Cha&s;tening for the pre&s;ent &s;eemeth to be joyous but grievous; neverthele&s;s, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, un|to them that are exerci&s;ed thereby. Upon which Account he con&s;iders every Fight of Affliction as a Talent, the right Improvement of which, will work for him a far more exceeding, and eternal Weight of Glory. And this may well make him patient in Tribulation. For he reckons that the Sufferings of the pre&s;ent Time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which &s;hall be revealed in us.</P>
<P>Moreover, The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t looks unto Je&s;us the Author and fini&s;her of his Faith; who for the Joy that was &s;et before him, endured
<PB N="13" REF="004196_0084_1004198509CD5E70">
the Cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the Shame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the Throne of God. And con|&s;idering him that endured &s;uch Contradiction of Sinners again&s;t him&s;elf; and al&s;o, that Chri&s;t &s;uf|fered for us, leaving us an Example that we &s;hould follow his Steps; he is not wearied, neither doth he faint in his Mind; but is ready to deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s, and follow his Ma&s;ter, not thinking any Thing too much to &s;uffer from a Sen&s;e of Gratitude, and a Principle of Love and Subjection to him, who his own &s;elf bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, and hath redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law, being made a Cur&s;e for us.</P>
<P>In fine, The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t is per|&s;waded, that it is only if need be, that he is now in Heavine&s;s for a Sea&s;on thro' manifold Temptations. He can truly &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;alm cxix. 75. <HI>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulne&s;s ha&s;t afflicted me.</HI> And there|fore in&s;tead of murmuring at his Ma&s;ter, or envy|ing his Fellow-Servants, who &s;eem thro' le&s;s Tribu|lation than he, to be entring into the Kingdom of God; he ki&s;&s;es the Rod, and ble&s;&s;es him that ap|pointed it; knowing that Tribulation worketh Pa|tience; and Patience, Experience; and Experience, Hope; and Hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the Love of God is &s;hed abroad in his Heart, by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given unto him.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The faithful Servant of Chri&s;t per&s;everes in his Duty with an unbroken Re&s;olution as long as he lives.</HI> He remembers the Faithfulne&s;s of his ble&s;&s;ed Lord to the Intere&s;t of mi&s;erable Sinners, when for their Sakes, he humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s. He re|members that one great End of this was, that we
<PB N="14" REF="004196_0085_1003FAFB73260A38">
being delivered out of the Hands of our Enemies, might &s;erve him without Fear, in Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s before him, all the Days of our Life. He con&s;iders that his Lord hath promi&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender eternal Life, only to them, who &s;eek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, by <HI>patient Continu|ance in Well-doing;</HI> But that, if any Man draw back, his Soul will have no Plea&s;ure in him. And upon &s;uch Con&s;iderations as the&s;e, the faithful Ser|vant of Chri&s;t can &s;ay, <HI>I have inclined mine Heart to perform thy Statutes alway even unto the End. I have &s;worn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments. All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my No&s;trils, I will not forget thee, neither will I deal fal&s;ly in thy Covenant. My Heart &s;hall not turn back, nor my Steps decline from thy Ways.</HI> And having once framed &s;uch ho|ly and vigorous Re&s;olutions, he earne&s;tly endea|vours to hold them fa&s;t; and <HI>through the Supply of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> he becomes <HI>Stedfa&s;t, Un|moveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord.</HI> But the&s;e Things may &s;uffice for the main Strokes in the Character of the faithful Servants of Chri&s;t. It only remains under this Head, that I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;uch Servants as the&s;e, &s;hall he highly ap|plauded by their Ma&s;ter.</HI> He knoweth all Things, he knoweth that they love him. He knows their Works, their Labour, and their Patience. He looks down from Heaven with Approbation and Plea&s;ure upon them now. And he is not unrighteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to forget their Work, and Labour of Love, which they have &s;hewed to his Name: But when he &s;hall come in his Glory, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the holy Angels with him, and &s;hall &s;it upon the Throne of his Glory, he will call them good and faithful Servants, the ble&s;&s;ed of his Father: he will approve &amp; applaud
<PB N="15" REF="004196_0086_10041990EA0147D8">
their Faithfulne&s;s and Obedience, and publi&s;h to their everla&s;ting Honour, their pious and charita|ble Works in the Pre&s;ence of the whole A&s;&s;embly of Men and Angels, who &s;hall be gathered before him at that Day; &s;aying, <HI>I was an hungred and ye gave me Meat, I was thir&s;ty and ye gave me Drink,</HI> &amp;c. Thus their Faithfulne&s;s &s;hall be found <HI>unto Prai&s;e, and Honour, and Glory at the Appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And not only &s;o, but as I am to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>It &s;hall be gloriou&s;ly rewarded by him al&s;o.</HI> Their Reward hereafter &s;hall be va&s;tly greater than their Improvements have been here; &amp; they &s;hall have Comfort and Peace, and un&s;peakable Rejoycing evermore in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. For <HI>they &s;hall be made Rulers over many Things,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>enter into the Joy of their Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They &s;hall be made Rulers over many Things.</HI> This is &s;poken after the Manner of earthly Princes. For as they, if they be good and wi&s;e, will advance tho&s;e Servants to higher Offices, whom they have found faithful in lower, &s;o will Chri&s;t do al&s;o. He will make all his faithful Servants Kings &amp; Prie&s;ts unto God, &amp; his Father. He will give them a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. He will grant to them to &s;it with him in his Throne; and to inherit the King|dom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. i. 6.2. Tim. iv. 8. Rev. iii. 21. Marth. xxv. 34.</NOTE>. What a Di&s;proportion is here be|tween the Work and the Reward of a faithful Ser|vant? He is faithful over a few Things, and he is rewarded for it with a Crown, a Throne, a King|dom! Verily, Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done; but according to his Mercy he &s;aves and rewards us!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="004196_0087_10041999E3B76308">2. <HI>They &s;hall enter into the Joy of their Lord.</HI> Sorrow &amp; Sighing &s;hall now flee away for ever, and all Tears &s;hall be wiped from their Eyes. All the Springs of Joy and Gladne&s;s &s;hall be opened unto them; for they &s;hall &s;ee God Face to Face, &amp; &s;hall be made like unto him by &s;eeing him as he is. In his Pre&s;ence they &s;hall find their Joys to be full, and their Plea&s;ures everla&s;ting. Then &s;hall be ve|rified that Word of their Lord, the Glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them. Father, I will that they al&s;o whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou ha&s;t given me. And <HI>that beholding</HI> cannot mean a meerly <HI>contemplative,</HI> but a <HI>fruitive</HI> Intuition. <HI>If &s;o be that we &s;uffer with him, that we may be al&s;o glorified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gether,</HI> Rom. viii. 17.</P>
<P>I might now proceed to infer from what you have heard, How ble&s;&s;ed a Thing it is to be a faithful Servant of Chri&s;t? How ea&s;ily we may ac|count for it, why our Lord &s;uffers his mo&s;t faith|ful Servants to undergo &s;o much Tribulation in this World? How unrea&s;onable it would be, either to for&s;ake the Service of &s;uch a Ma&s;ter, or to go on dejectedly in it, becau&s;e of the Difficulties which may &s;ometimes attend it? How fooli&s;h and wicked a Thing it is to refu&s;e this Service, or de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who are faithful in it; or to do any thing which may tend to render the Labours of any faithful Ser|vant of Chri&s;t le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, than otherwi&s;e they might have been? In fine, How much the condi|tion of the Generality of Mankind is to be lament|ed, who in&s;tead of devoting them&s;elves to the Ser|vice of Chri&s;t, make them&s;elves Slaves to the wor&s;t of Ma&s;ters? But the&s;e, and many other u&s;eful Re|flections, which might be made upon what hath been di&s;cour&s;ed at this Time, I mu&s;t leave to be enlarged upon in your private Meditations and may only add,</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004196_0088_100419A0CE560B40"><HI>That from the De&s;cription which hath been given of a good and faithful Servant, I think we may well con|clude, that the Servant of Chri&s;t lately taken from our Head was &s;uch a one.</HI> Indeed his Character hath been already drawn &s;o well, by much better Hands than mine, that there is no Occa&s;ion for my attempt|ing <HI>that.</HI> I &s;hall therefore only go on to ob&s;erve &s;uch Things concerning him, as my Subject natu|rally leads me to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Under a former Head we have taken a View of &s;ome of tho&s;e Talents which his Lord delivered to him; and here we may turn our Thoughts with Plea&s;ure and Advantage upon his Faithfulne&s;s in improving them to his Ma&s;ter's Honour, and the Service of his Generation.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider, how &s;hort a Time he &s;pent in this Society when a young Man, in Compari&s;on of what many have done of later Years; how long he was removed from it; what weighty Cares were upon him, during the Time of his Removal; and yet when he returned to it, what a con&s;iderable Ac|quaintance he retained with the learned Languages, and other Parts of Learning al&s;o, according to the State of them with us in his younger Time; and how laudably, and to what general Acceptance he pre&s;ided at the fir&s;t anniver&s;ary Solemnity after his Return, before he began to be broken with bodily Pains and Weakne&s;s; we may very rea&s;onably conclude, that he faithfully improved the Advan|tage of an academical Education by hard Study in his Youth.</P>
<P>Again, How diligent, how con&s;tant, how labori|ous he was in the Di&s;charge of all the Duties of the pa&s;toral Office while he &s;tood in that Relation, you have already been informed by tho&s;e who had &s;ufficient Opportunity to ob&s;erve that Part of his Life and Character.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004196_0089_100419A986CB5970">And how great his Faithfulne&s;s was in the Du|ties of the honourable Relation which he bore to this Society in his la&s;t Years, you need not that a|ny &s;hould inform you. Ye are all Witne&s;&s;es, and God al&s;o, how holily, and ju&s;tly, and unblameably he behaved him&s;elf among you. Ye are all Wit|ne&s;&s;es of his &s;ervent Affection and Devotion to his Ma&s;ter; of his exemplary Patience and Re&s;ignati|on to his Will under &s;ore Pains, and of long Con|tinuance; of his tender Concern for the Intere&s;t of this Society, and the be&s;t Good of all it's Mem|bers; and of his unwearied Application to all the Duties of his Office, in which he always &s;eemed to go to the utmo&s;t of his Ability, and many Times almo&s;t beyond it. Sure I am, that &s;ome of us have &s;pent whole Days in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Society with him, when it hath been a continual Unea&s;i|ne&s;s to us to &s;ee that he could take no Re&s;t in any Po&s;ture, by Rea&s;on of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Pains; and yet have not heard one Complaint come out of his Mouth, no ob&s;erved any Token of his being di&s;|po&s;ed to have the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day hurried o|ver; but as long as there was any Bu&s;ine&s;s to be done, or any Day left to do it in, he hath always appeared as willing and patient, as tho&s;e who were mo&s;t at Ea&s;e and in Health, to attend upon it, And &s;o he continued without fainting in his Mind, faithful to the Death.</P>
<P>And now, we may very well refre&s;h our &s;elves with the Thought, that the Applau&s;es &amp; Rewards of a good and faithful Servant are become his Por|tion and Inheritance forever. And God grant that none of us may be &s;lothful; but followers of him who through Faith and Patience inherits the Pro|mi&s;es.</P>
