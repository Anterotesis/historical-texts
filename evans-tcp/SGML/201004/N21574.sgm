<Q><BIBL><HI>PROVERBS,</HI> xxii. 6.</BIBL>
<P>TRAIN UP A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO: AND WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_MANY wi&s;e and excellent <HI>proverbs</HI> have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, by men of the mo&s;t eminent worth and value, as u&s;eful and important. Among which, not any have a more ju&s;t claim to preeminence, than tho&s;e of the wi&s;e and learned <HI>King</HI> of I&s;|rael. Perhaps not one, among the great variety to be found in his writings, is more u&s;eful and excellent, than that which we have cho&s;en for the <HI>theme</HI> of our di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS, above all others, is verified in mo&s;t in|&s;tances. It cannot be rea&s;onably expected, that it &s;hould be &s;trictly confirmed in every particular in|&s;tance; as there are but very few, if any, rules, prov|erbs
<PB N="8" REF="028362_0005_0FD8C6BC8576F8B8">
or maxims, but what admit of &s;ome few exceptions. In mo&s;t of the in&s;tances where this <HI>proverb,</HI> contained in the <HI>text,</HI> is thought not to prove &s;trictly true, yet if they &s;hould be carefully examined, there would be found &s;ome defect in not having &s;trictly attended to the <HI>proverb,</HI> rather than in the <HI>proverb</HI> it&s;elf, We may, therefore, &s;afely receive this <HI>proverb,</HI> as one of the mo&s;t general, u&s;eful and important proverbs or max|ims, any where known, either verbally among man|kind, or upon record.</P>
<P>"TRAIN <HI>up a child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI>"</P>
<P>As this <HI>proverb</HI> is &s;o generally verified, &s;o u&s;eful and important, a &s;trict attention to the <HI>exhortation</HI> contained in it, which is, <HI>"Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go,"</HI> is of the <HI>highe&s;t moment:</HI> for in &s;o doing, the happy con&s;equence, will, according to the <HI>proverb,</HI> naturally follow, which is, <HI>"And when he is old he will not depart from it."</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Exordium,</HI> the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> which will af|ford matter for the &s;equel of the di&s;cour&s;e, naturally ari&s;eth, How or in what manner are CHILDREN to be trained up? Both rea&s;on and revelation, are ready to give an <HI>an&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>REASON <HI>an&s;wers,</HI> Train up CHILDREN in that way, in which they will make valuable members of a com|munity; and in that way al&s;o, which will &s;ecure to them, <HI>joy, peace</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of mind as long as they continue to exi&s;t. REVELATION is ready to aid and confirm the voice of REASON, by &s;aying, "<HI>And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the</HI> LORD."</P>
<P>IF CHILDREN, according to the <HI>pa&s;&s;age</HI> now cited, are trained up in the nurture &amp; admonition of the LORD, they will become u&s;eful ORNAMENTS of &s;ociety, happy
<PB N="9" REF="028362_0006_0FD8C6BC8837E1C0">
in their own minds, and will, beyond the &s;hort &s;pan of human life, be completely happy in the enjoyment of their CREATOR.</P>
<P>THIS, in various places in the <HI>&s;acred oracles,</HI> is evidently confirmed. Tho&s;e that are trained up in the way of true chri&s;tian virtue, will be adopted as the true <HI>children</HI> of God, &s;uch being cho&s;en through Chri&s;t, as heirs of a joyful immortality. Unto &s;uch, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>all things,</HI> which God in his con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, &s;ees will be&s;t tend to advance their everla&s;ting <HI>peace, joy</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> &s;hall be a|bundantly added.</P>
<P>THIS is the language of the GOSPEL, "<HI>Seek ye fir&s;t the kingdom of</HI> GOD, <HI>and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall he added unto you.</HI>"</P>
<P>THAT this mo&s;t happy <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> re&s;ulting from training up <HI>children</HI> in the way they &s;hould go, might take place, they mu&s;t, while buding to bloom in youth, be properly educated.</P>
<P>THE education of children, is an intere&s;ting con|cern, to all tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;entiments of love and compa&s;&s;ion for them; as al&s;o to all &s;uch as have any regard for the well being of mankind, e&s;pecially of the inhabitants of the <HI>community,</HI> to which they belong.</P>
<P>THE peace and happine&s;s of <HI>children</HI> in the future periods of their exi&s;tence, and likewi&s;e of their place of re&s;idence, as al&s;o of mankind in general, eminently de|pend upon their being rightly educated.</P>
<P>IF their education &s;hould be neglected, they will &s;tep forth upon the <HI>&s;tage</HI> of action, ignorant, rude and barbarous, unfit rightly to &s;erve and wor&s;hip their CRE|ATOR; and likewi&s;e unqualified for the company of the poli&s;hed and well informed part of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028362_0007_0FD8C6C0A757AF90">SHOULD, therefore, the education of children be|come generally neglected, &s;uper&s;tition, mi&s;ery and de|&s;truction, would inevitably be the awful con&s;equences. Intellectual plea&s;ures, or tho&s;e of a mind refined by ce|le&s;tial virtue, and illuminated by the emanating rays of divine love, could then never be experienced in all their purifying and plea&s;urable effects. But few other joys and plea&s;ures, would be known, but tho&s;e which are &s;en&s;ual, proceeding from hearts defiled, like contami|nated &s;treams, i&s;&s;uing from impure fountains. Victo|ry and triumph, would con&s;i&s;t, as they now do among the <HI>&s;avages of the wilderne&s;s;</HI> while the honor of ob|taining a victory over ther own pa&s;&s;ions would be un|known, and the joys of a happy triumph over the <HI>pow|ers of darkne&s;s</HI> never po&s;&s;e&s;s their hearts. Their virtue and morality, would be none other, than that which was conformable, however ridiculous, to the place in which they had been trained up. Such are the deplor|able con&s;equences of ignorance, every one will readily acknowledge, who has but &s;uperficially examined the hi&s;tory of mankind; and but with indifference, &s;ur|veyed the great variety of practices and cu&s;toms of &s;ome of the many &s;tates, kingdoms and nations of the earth. By &s;uch, it will be acknowledged, that tho&s;e <HI>actions</HI> or <HI>practices,</HI> which, in &s;ome places among the ignorant and unpoli&s;hed, are e&s;teemed as virtuous and honorable, are indeed ridiculous and impious; and which, among the truly virtuous and well informed, would be thus e&s;|teemed. According, therefore, as children are educa|ted, will be their <HI>notions, ideas</HI> and <HI>practices,</HI> when they &s;hall have come forth upon the theatre of time. Truly is the <HI>proverb</HI> contained in the <HI>text,</HI> verified,&mdash; <HI>"Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it."</HI></P>
<P>BY contra&s;ting <HI>ignorance</HI> with <HI>knowledge,</HI> it will &s;till be thought to have a more glaring and odious ap|pearance. Innumerable are the happy con&s;equences re&s;ulting from a general diffu&s;ion of u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028362_0008_0FD8C6C1C68F8120">THOSE that have early had their minds refined by a good education, can ri&s;e, upon the wings of &s;cience, far above the &s;ordid plea&s;ures of the ignorant and un|poli&s;hed. With their a&s;piring minds, they can &s;oar on high, even from <HI>earth</HI> to <HI>heaven,</HI> and from <HI>pole</HI> to <HI>pole,</HI> contemplating with exqui&s;ite delight, the maje&s;|tic works of creation and the beauties of nature, which, with plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, every where &s;trike the en|lightened mind.</P>
<P>LEARNING not only capacitates the mind for &s;can|ning with plea&s;ure the works and beauties of creation: but renders it a fit recipient and a proper repo&s;itory of con&s;i&s;tent ideas of God, the great Creator and Up|holder of all things.</P>
<P>THOSE minds, which remain deformed by <HI>igno|rance,</HI> have very incon&s;i&s;tent ideas of God, his per|fections natural and moral, and of his dealings with his intelligent creatures. To the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, both hi&s;tory and our own ob&s;ervations, will bear te&s;ti|mony.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE obtained from u&s;eful <HI>learning,</HI> im|prints on the mind many important ideas; prepares, if rightly improved, tho&s;e, who&s;e minds are thus ex|panded, to act their parts right and well in the world; and to them, points out the <HI>way,</HI> that leads to the happy abodes of the ble&s;&s;ed, where fountains of knowl|edge, &s;prings of peace, rivers of plea&s;ure and &s;treams of joy, in one ince&s;&s;ant pro&s;pect for ever ri&s;e, making glad the hearts of the <HI>myriads</HI> of its <HI>ely&s;ian</HI> inhabitants. It is knowledge, which teaches us to a&s;&s;ert the &s;over|eignty of our nature; and to a&s;&s;ume that <HI>dignity</HI> in the &s;cale of being, for which we were created.</P>
<P>THOUSANDS of utilities, elegancies, joys and plea&s;ures, owe their birth and being to it, without which, exi&s;tence it&s;elf would be but an in&s;ipid enjoy|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028362_0009_0FD8C6C888B22688">SUCH are the happy con&s;equences, privileges and advantages; which wholly depend upon the right <HI>education</HI> of children.</P>
<P>THE real worth or &s;uperiority of mankind, above the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, appear only, by rightly culti|vating, repleni&s;hing and poli&s;hing their minds, with <HI>knowledge</HI> received from learning's &s;ource.</P>
<P>LEARNING or education, does for the mind, the &s;ame that the poli&s;hing hand of the arti&s;t that works on rich and precious GEMS, does to ONE taken from the earth, as it there laid in its hidden rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE <HI>mind</HI> originally, as in children upon their entrance into the world, is de&s;titute of all ideas, ex|cepting &s;uch as they immediately receive from &s;en&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>THE mind or under&s;tanding, &s;eems not to have any original ideas imprinted on it, but appears rather to be de&s;titute of the lea&s;t glimmering of all innate knowledge.</P>
<P>"A CAREFUL examination of the minds of young children, <HI>&s;ays a learned and ingenious Writer,</HI> will &s;ufficiently convince us, that they bring not many o|riginal ideas into the world with them."</P>
<P>IF there were any original ideas in the <HI>mind,</HI> which in its fir&s;t being it receives, tho&s;e ideas mo&s;t certainly would be univer&s;ally known, and acknowledged by all mankind as inconte&s;tible truths; which we &s;uffi|ciently know has never been the ca&s;e, even with re&s;|pect to the mo&s;t &s;elf evident propo&s;itions and nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tences.</P>
<P>THIS, therefore, is &s;ufficient to convince us, that the <HI>mind</HI> originally is &s;imilar to white paper, being void of all innate characters.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028362_0010_0FD8C6C9E45AC728">AS God has neither made nor done any thing in vain, it would be impertinent to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>mind</HI> had any ideas or characters engraven on it in its fir&s;t exi&s;tence: for as we are endowed with &s;uch noble powers and faculties by which we are capacitated, to obtain all the ideas nece&s;&s;ary for us to have, to &s;up|po&s;e this, would be to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;uperfluous operation of the divine agency.</P>
<P>IT is therefore, only by improvement, and that by degrees, that the mind comes to be &s;tored with any <HI>fund</HI> of u&s;eful knowledge. At fir&s;t, the &s;en&s;es let into the mind, particular ideas, called the ideas of &s;en&s;a|tion. After which, the mind, begins to exerci&s;e its own powers, by ab&s;tracting and compounding the ideas it received from &s;en&s;ation; and by a certain progre&s;|&s;ion, learns for each of its ideas both &s;imple and com|plex, particular and general names with their u&s;e and de&s;ign. The ideas received from the perception of the operations of the <HI>mind,</HI> are the ideas of reflection; which operations are the &s;ource, from which proceeds all our u&s;eful knowledge, re&s;pecting virtue and mo|rality, in which is included our duty both towards God and man, as well as our joy, peace and happine&s;s. This is the <HI>way</HI> or <HI>manner,</HI> in which the <HI>mind</HI> is fur|ni&s;hed with ideas and the u&s;e of language; and by which it is enabled to exerci&s;e its di&s;cur&s;ive faculties. It, therefore, eminently depends upon the right edu|cation of children, re&s;pecting their future pro&s;perity, knowledge and u&s;efulne&s;s in the world. It is educa|tion, which rai&s;es one above another in real worth and merit.</P>
<P>THE divine portion of genius is diffu&s;ed among the rich and the poor, the high and the low; and requires only the poli&s;hing hand of education, to make it &s;hine <HI>in each</HI> with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THE great di&s;parity among mankind, ari&s;es not &s;o much from the want of gifts, as from the want of a
<PB N="14" REF="028362_0011_0FD8C6CE8E5841A8">
proper education. Among crouds of the untutored, real evidences of a bright genius, may often plainly be di&s;covered. Many of tho&s;e, who traver&s;e America's de&s;erts, to whom no other joys and plea&s;ures are known, "but the cha&s;e and the pipe"&mdash;have as great if not greater natural abilities, than tho&s;e, who among the civilized, fill di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tations of u&s;efulne&s;s and honor.</P>
<P>"MAN, by nature, <HI>&s;ays</HI> ONE, is like a piece of marble ju&s;t taken from the quarry; and 'tis education which gives the u&s;e, the form and the poli&s;h."</P>
<P>MANY of tho&s;e, who have been rai&s;ed to dignified &s;tations of honor and u&s;efulne&s;s, have been taken from the mo&s;t humble &s;ituations in the world, and advanced to them, by means of their education with great dig|nity and reputation. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this, we have in the life of MOSES. Reflect a moment,&mdash;"How great the contra&s;t between <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the mar&s;hy weeds," and MOSES the Commander of the people and <HI>armies</HI> of the GOD of ho&s;ts! Behold <HI>him</HI> at one time in an <HI>Ark</HI> of bulru&s;hes, floating upon the river Nile; and at a|nother as a mo&s;t noble Commander under the &s;upreme KING of <HI>kings,</HI> &s;tanding upon the banks of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> &s;afely conducting the cho&s;en of the Lord, through the paths of the watery element! Whence, therefore, may the que&s;tion be ju&s;tly a&s;ked, was this &s;trange &s;ur|prizing rever&s;e of fortune? Was it wholly owing to his being taken from the <HI>Ark</HI> of bulru&s;hes, upon the banks of a dangerous river? No! For notwith&s;tanding he was thus &s;aved from the very jaws of death; yet his eminence and worth, are to be attributed to &s;ome great|er CAUSE. It was his education, under the &s;uperin|tending providence of God, which prepared him to be &s;uch a pattern of meekne&s;s; &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing to the cho&s;en of the Lord; and to commence the performer of &s;uch a &s;cene of wonders, as "mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h the world to the late&s;t ages." Had it not been for his ed|ucation, his genius and latent &s;eeds of meekne&s;s and
<PB N="15" REF="028362_0012_0FD8C6CFEAAFAC60">
virtue, together with his great u&s;efulne&s;s to generations gone, to the pre&s;ent and to tho&s;e that are yet to come, would, like a lump of unwrought gold, never have ap|peared according to their true value; but would have been concealed by the impenetrable &s;hades of igno|rance.</P>
<P>PHARAOH'S daughter is worthy of a high eulogium, for her kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> a poor for&s;aken child; for &s;natching him from a watery grave; and for what is yet greater, providing him with the means of educa|tion. "As &s;oon as his age and capacity would admit, <HI>&s;ays a celebrated</HI> DIVINE, he was &s;ent to &s;chool, where under the mo&s;t improved in&s;tructors, he made uncom|mon proficiency in his &s;tudies." "<HI>He was learned,</HI> &s;aith an in&s;pired WRITER, <HI>in all the wi&s;dom of the E|gyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</HI>"</P>
<P>BY educating this child, O <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called &s;o by Jo&s;ephus.</NOTE> Thermutis! thou did&s;t perform great &s;ervice to mankind; <HI>and did&s;t heap upon</HI> thy&s;elf exalted encomlums. This benevolent act, gave thee more joy, than all the gay plea&s;ures of a &s;plendid life; added more charms to thy per&s;on than &s;parkling eyes, blu&s;hing cheeks, and curling tru&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme glory, &s;hall be a&s;cribed to God, while blooming flowers &s;hall be &s;catter'd in the paths, in which, O Thermutis! thou walke&s;t with thy maid|ens down to the River, from which thou did&s;t draw <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> the &s;on of a &s;lave.</P>
<P>SINCE &s;uch wonderous acts are performed, and &s;uch great good accrues to mankind, by the means of education, it is of the utmo&s;t importance to cultivate by learning, tho&s;e latent &s;parks of genius in the minds of children, that they may be rightly employed for their own advantage, and for the benefit of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028362_0013_0FD8BD73521F8AA8">THE more that true knowledge is diffu&s;ed, the more will true peace and happine&s;s be enjoyed; the more &s;afe will be the rights and liberties of each indi|vidual; and the more likely will be the holy religion of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Redeemer</HI> to prevail and flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>A GENERAL diffu&s;ion of u&s;eful knowledge, will have a happy tendency to make the inhabitants of the world, as are the citizens of America enlightened and free; to prevent the ambitious and de&s;igning from u|&s;urping either political or eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny; and to qualify a people to be happy &s;ubjects and virtuous rulers.</P>
<P>"TYRANNY, bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, <HI>&s;ays</HI> ONE, are &s;upported only by gloomy ignorance." "The&s;e, whenever the divine ray of knowledge &s;hall illume the benighted parts of the earth, will flee, like Satan," "with the &s;hades of the night."</P>
<P>IN this Country, where liberty is the ba&s;is of its government, where birth and riches give no preem|inence; "and where merit alone has the &s;ure&s;t claim" to di&s;tinction, there are but very few, who may not be &s;o trained up or educated, as to be qualified to fill <HI>with reputation</HI> the highe&s;t places of honor and tru&s;t; or at the lea&s;t, to make hone&s;t, u&s;eful and peaceable citizens. If therefore, CHILDREN are trained up in the way they &s;hould go, when they &s;hall have ari&s;en to years of maturity, they will not depart from it; but in it with plea&s;ure will delight to walk.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, we may infer, that it is the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of parents, to rightly train up or educate their children in <HI>that way,</HI> in which they &s;hould go when they are old.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028362_0014_0FD8C6D671262F10">AS children come into the world de&s;titute of ideas, as we have &s;hown, they ought early to be furni&s;hed with the means of education, that their young and ten|der minds, which can ea&s;ily be moulded into any form, might be repleni&s;hed with &s;uitable &amp; nece&s;&s;ary knowl|edge. It is, therefore, dangerous to defer the edu|cation of children till they &s;hall have imbibed certain &s;entiments, notions and ideas, which, however <HI>ridicu|lous</HI> and <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> they will never renounce.</P>
<P>MANY parents really injure their children by not giving them a proper education for the calling, in which it is probable they will follow, at as early a period of life, as would have been con&s;i&s;tent with their capacities for learning and improvement.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING a very con&s;iderable knowledge of the arts and &s;ciences, may, at an advanced age of life be obtained; yet it has been remarked and that very ju&s;tly, that mo&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons will be contracted in their views and &s;entiments, practicably infallible and &s;elf conceited, and illiberal and uncharitable in mo&s;t of their proceedings. They are commonly de&s;titute of all delicate impre&s;&s;ions, their hearts being as hard as the adamantine rock. If &s;uch per&s;ons &s;u&s;tain a religious character or act in a &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion, they will impute all their incon&s;i&s;tencies to the &s;acred &s;pirit of God, or perhaps for a con&s;cientious zeal for his glory. By their blind, ab&s;urd and infatuated zeal, together with their pretended orthodoxy, they e&s;&s;entially injure the cau&s;e of true religion, which they have been endeavouring to &s;upport. The opinions or &s;entiments of &s;uch, can by rea&s;on no more be altered, than thunder clouds can be turned, or the everla&s;ting hills be moved by the voice or &s;trength of man. Nothing but fear, &s;hame and puni&s;hment, withhold them from imitating the deluded followers of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Impo&s;tor,</HI> in un&s;heathing the SWORD of JEHOVAH, and pointing it at the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e, who fall not in with their fanatical notions
<PB N="18" REF="028362_0015_0FD8C6D76CCF9690">
and per&s;ecuting principles. Such, <HI>my friends,</HI> are the natural and dreadful con&s;equences, of neglecting the early and proper education of children.</P>
<P>SUFFER me, therefore, ye PARENTS <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> to di|rect a few words of <HI>addre&s;s</HI> to you, upon this important and intere&s;ting concern.</P>
<P>PERMIT <HI>one, my friends,</HI> who experimentally knows not the joys, fears and anxieties of a parent, to intreat you for your own honor, and for what is yet far greater, for the future pro&s;perity of your children, to give to them as good an education as you can con&s;i&s;tently with your &s;everal abilities. The future characters and conduct of your children, yea, their everla&s;ting happi|ne&s;s in an eminent &s;en&s;e, depend upon the education they &s;hall receive from you. You can perform no greater kindne&s;s, and manife&s;t no greater parental affection for <HI>them,</HI> than by giving <HI>them</HI> an opportunity to obtain a u&s;eful and valuable education. In this <HI>way,</HI> you will probably prevent their own mi&s;ery and ruin; and at the &s;ame time perform an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to mankind. To thus a&s;&s;i&s;t them, is far more commendable, than it is to be&s;tow on them riches and hereditary honors. By &s;o doing, you will prepare them for u&s;efulne&s;s in the world, for honor and happine&s;s, and for a proper man|agement of them&s;elves, when they &s;hall appear upon the &s;tage of action, to take a part in life's great DRAMA.</P>
<P>MANY a bright genius, have &s;pent their days in the low and humble walks of life, for the want of hav|ing their minds improved by education; and finally have gone down to the grave, without ever appearing to advantage in the world. Hearken to the language of a celebrated POET, after contemplating, <HI>in a bury|ing yard,</HI> the <HI>monuments</HI> erected to the memory of the <HI>dead:</HI>&mdash;

<P>SUFFICIENT has been &s;aid to per&s;uade you, <HI>my friends,</HI> not to neglect the early and proper education of your children. In educating them, you will aim to have them in&s;tructed in heavenly knowledge.</P>
<P>A FEW words, in addition to what has been &s;aid, re&s;pecting their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> in&s;truction, will not be con|&s;idered as unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AS long as they are under your particular care and direction, you will, like the pious and mo&s;t amiable PARENT, the AUTHOR of the text, be frequently cal|ling upon them to obtain heavenly knowledge; and with all their getting to get a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart. Guard as much as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t their em|bracing &s;uch religious &s;entiments, as are di&s;honorary to God, or incon&s;i&s;tent with that benevolent character, in which he is clothed both in the BOOK of rea&s;on and revelation. In a particular manner, guard again&s;t their being enthu&s;ia&s;tical in religion; again&s;t their minds being ab&s;orbed in a <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> which literally &s;huts the gate of mercy upon mo&s;t of the human race.</P>
<P>NEVER become guilty of in&s;tructing, yea nor even countenancing them in embracing &s;uch religious &s;en|timents,
<PB N="20" REF="028362_0017_0FD8C6DEB84C9130">
as involve in them &s;uch palpable ab&s;urdities, as neither <HI>Angels, Man</HI> nor <HI>Devils,</HI> can ever make to appear plau&s;ible to a rational and unprejudiced mind. Always endeavor to repre&s;ent God to them, in the mo&s;t amiable, endearing and benevolent character; that they may love, not &s;ervilely fear and dread HIM, as &s;ome awful, horrible and mo&s;t powerful TYRANT, de|lighting in damnation and mi&s;ery. With the pious ELDER of old, may you &s;ay, <HI>"I have no greater joy, than to hear that my children walk in the truth."</HI></P>
<P>MAY you have the happine&s;s to &s;ee your <HI>children,</HI> increa&s;e in learning; preparing to &s;hine as di&s;tingui&s;h|ed LIGHTS in the world, and to behold THEM walking in <HI>that path,</HI> which leads to the heavenly man&s;ions in glory, where there is <HI>knowledge</HI> to be obtained beyond finite conception, and peace, joys and plea&s;ures be|yond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE youth of this <HI>congregation,</HI> particularly tho&s;e that have attended my in&s;tructions, &s;hall next claim particular attention in the &s;equel of the <HI>&s;ubject.</HI></P>
<P>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</P>
<P>YOU have heard in this <HI>di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> that your future honor, u&s;efulne&s;s and happine&s;s, depend eminently on your education. You will, therefore, while in the morning of your <HI>days,</HI> prepare your&s;elves by your ed|ucation, for honor among mankind, u&s;efulne&s;s to the world, and profit to your&s;elves, when the <HI>voices</HI> of your parents can no more be heard, nor their <HI>hands</HI> be &s;tretched out no longer for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If it is the duty of your <HI>parents</HI> to in&s;truct you, and to pro|vide for you the means of education, it is then your indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, to hearken to all their faithful and benevolent admonitions, precepts and in&s;tructions; and gratefully to improve every <HI>opportunity,</HI> which they may afford you for obtaining u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028362_0018_0FD8C6E0622516C0">NOW is the be&s;t and only time for the proper im|provement and cultivation of your minds. Be intreat|ed then, to attend diligently to all the means of in|&s;truction, with which your PARENTS in <HI>love</HI> may fa|vor you.</P>
<P>BUT above all, you mu&s;t &s;eek to obtain the knowl|edge of God; and of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the way of Salvation through HIM, as it is revealed in the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> To this END, you will faithfully attend to the in&s;tructions of pious PARENTS and TEACHERS. Heavenly knowledge, is highly recommended to your <HI>choice</HI> in repeated in&s;tances by the wi&s;e, virtuous and learned <HI>Preacher</HI> of I&s;rael. This is his language:&mdash;</P>
<P>"MY <HI>Son, hear the in&s;truction of thy</HI> FATHER, <HI>and for&s;ake not the law of thy</HI> MOTHER: <HI>For they &s;hall be an</HI> ornament of grace <HI>unto thy head, and</HI> chains <HI>about</HI> thy neck." "<HI>Hear ye children the in&s;truction of a father, and attend to know under&s;tanding. For I give you good doctrine, for&s;ake ye not my law. For I was my</HI> FATHER'S <HI>&s;on, tender and only beloved in the &s;ight of my</HI> MOTHER." My <HI>Father</HI> taught me, and my <HI>Mother</HI> frequently in&s;tructed me&mdash;<HI>"And &s;aid un|to me, let thine heart retain my words; keep my com|mandments and live." "Take fa&s;t hold of</HI> in&s;truction; <HI>let</HI> her <HI>not go; keep</HI> her; <HI>for</HI> &s;he <HI>is thy life." "Re|ceive my</HI> in&s;truction, <HI>and not &s;ilver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For</HI> wi&s;dom <HI>is better than ru|bies; and all the things that may be de&s;ired are not to be compared to"</HI> her. Many more pa&s;&s;ages might be ea&s;ily cited, <HI>were it nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> in which wi&s;dom and in&s;truction are highly recommended to the choice of Youth.</P>
<P>AMONG the great variety you &s;hall only once more be refered to the <HI>&s;tory</HI> of the wi&s;e <HI>Preacher's</HI> choice, when God in the days of his youth, thus addre&s;&s;ed <HI>him, "A&s;k what I &s;hall give thee."</HI> His choice, <HI>my
<PB N="22" REF="028362_0019_0FD8C6E1E56983C0">
young friends,</HI> teaches <HI>you</HI> that wi&s;dom or a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart, is to be cho&s;en and prefered as far more valuable than all earthly honors, riches and plea&s;ures. While <HI>health, riches</HI> and victory, were &s;preading their alluring charms before the <HI>young Mon|arch,</HI> recommending them&s;elves to his choice, when <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> appeared, it was with her alone, with which he was captivated. While it is an accepted time, be per&s;uaded to imitate <HI>Solomon</HI> in his choice; and like him, may you be wi&s;e to know the God of your fath|ers, and to &s;erve HIM with a perfect heart and willing mind. Your youthful days are fleeting fa&s;t; and will &s;oon be gone. Expiring time will &s;oon &s;catter hoary hairs among the mo&s;t beautiful locks; "draw furrows on the &s;moothe&s;t brow; and bla&s;t the ro&s;es on the fine&s;t cheek." Tho&s;e, therefore, who, AFTER <HI>their youth|ful and vigorous</HI> days are pa&s;t, would appear amiable and beautiful, mu&s;t have their <HI>minds</HI> adorned with heavenly wi&s;dom, and their <HI>hearts</HI> repleni&s;hed with the graces of the divine SPIRIT. May you be continually abounding in true knowledge and wi&s;dom; in true pi|ety and virtue; and in every good word and work. When done with time, may you be admitted to the full fruition of the joys and plea&s;ures of heaven; where you will ever be increa&s;ing in knowledge; flouri&s;hing in <HI>immortal youth;</HI> and glowing with crowns and di|adems of dazling beauty, through the rolling and cea&s;|le&s;s <HI>ages</HI> of <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, to comprehend, "THE ONE THING NEEDFUL," which involves in it, <HI>knowledge</HI> the mo&s;t important, as well as all riches, honors and plea&s;ures, is to have a <HI>&s;piritual knowledge</HI> of HIM, whom to know aright is <HI>Life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude therefore; May we all both young and old, be trained up for everla&s;ting life; and when through <HI>death's</HI> dark <HI>vault</HI> we &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed, may we
<PB N="23" REF="028362_0020_0FD8C6E3CFC66808">
through faith in the merits of the REDEEMER, be admit|ted to the delightful participation of the perfectly ble&s;|&s;ed in glory.</P>
