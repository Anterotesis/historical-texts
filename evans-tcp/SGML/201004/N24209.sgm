<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE pro&s;titution of women, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> pre|vails to a high degree in all large ci|ties, might be con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened by giv|ing them encouragement to enter into vari|ous occupations which are &s;uitable to them. An appeal &s;hould be made to the delicacy and the prudence of ladies of fortune, not to employ any but their own &s;ex, as milli|ners, and as &s;tay-makers. A man twirling a cap, or bending a pair of &s;tays, &s;hould be an object of ridicule, becau&s;e he is an in|&s;trument of mi&s;chief. He does harm by taking the bread from tho&s;e who cannot get it but by &s;uch means, while he can get it by innumerable other means. Women, how|ever, I think might be employed in many more occupations than are u&s;ually given to them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome good ob&s;ervations on Schools of Indu&s;try for girls in a valuable little work, by Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, called "The Economy of Charity." See from page 61 to page 80.</NOTE> Some think their mode&s;ty might be hurt in taking mea&s;ure for a &s;uit of clothes. They might, however, &s;ew the clothes to|gether, as is the cu&s;tom in &s;ome places, af|ter they were cut out by the tailor. The
<PB N="iv" REF="032001_0003_0FF09DC1F2442A00">making &s;tuff &s;hoes for their own &s;ex, might not be an improper employment for women. Some of the Dutch and Germans who &s;ettle in America; make their daughters do &s;everal parts of the work of their farms, even as far as ploughing. The work of a farm might be thought by &s;ome too laborious an occupation for women; but the advantages ari&s;ing from thus employing women might be very con&s;iderable. It might be of great u&s;e to agriculture, as well as to the women them&s;elves, by giving them health and cheer|fulne&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fothergill, in his excellent Treati&s;e on Health and Lon|gevity, recommends the being a con&s;iderable part of the day in the open air.</NOTE> and by preventing their living in large cities (which are very mi&s;chievous to a country) where, through the want of bread, they might be tempted to pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>The be&s;t pre&s;ervative, however, from the pro&s;titution of women, e&s;pecially of the lower cla&s;s, may con&s;i&s;t in the in&s;titution of Fir&s;t-day or Sunday &s;chools. If you are &s;o fortunate as to give people a &s;incere regard for Chri&s;tianity, you will make them cha&s;te. There are &s;ome who talk of the morality of the Dei&s;ts. I can &s;afely &s;ay, however, though I have known many Dei&s;ts, that I &s;carcely e|ver knew one moral character among them. It is the con&s;tant delight of almo&s;t very un|believer,
<PB N="v" REF="032001_0004_0FF09DC74B758860">to ridicule that cha&s;tity which is re|vered by Chri&s;tians. St. Paul, by what he &s;ays in the 24th ver&s;e of the 1&s;t chapter of the Epi&s;|tle to the Romans, and in what he &s;ay in the following part of his Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;a|lonians, &s;eems to ju&s;tify the&s;e notions. <Q>For this is the will of God, even your &s;anctifica|tion that ye &s;hould ab&s;tain from fornication; That every one &s;hould know how to po&s;|&s;e&s;s his ve&s;&s;el in &s;anctification and honour; Not in the lu&s;t of concupi&s;cence, even as the Gentiles, which know not God.</Q> I. Epi&s;tle, chap. iv, ver. 3, 4, 5.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have never been in large ci|ties, it may appear improbable that women of the town &s;hould die in any of them through want. This fact, however, may be a&s;certained beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt. A true &s;tory is told of the celebrated Dr. John&s;on, which makes him, in this particular, greatly to re|&s;emble the good Samaritan in Scripture. It is &s;aid, that once in London, when he was going to his hou&s;e, he &s;aw a woman lying pro&s;trate in the &s;treet. Upon inquiry he found it was a woman of the town, who had become weak and incapable to move through want. He nobly took her upon his back to his hou&s;e, gave her food and lodging until &s;he was perfectly recovered, and then with &s;en&s;ible admonitions to reform, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. This glorious act of humanity, might
<PB N="vi" REF="032001_0005_0FF09DC94ABC0430">make &s;ome atonement for the unju&s;t &s;everity with which he &s;ometimes treated others, for which he expre&s;&s;ed his remor&s;e and his repen|tance a little while before his death. Seneca &s;ays, that Cato compo&s;ed in bad fortune, was a &s;pectacle, which heaven might look down up|on with plea&s;ure. Ecce Spectaculum ad quod re&s;piciat operi &s;uo intentus Deus! Ecce Ca|tonem inter malam fortunam compo&s;itum! Might not this be &s;aid of Jon&s;on with a poor helple&s;s female upon his back, whom he was going to relieve, not for the purpo&s;es of lu&s;t, but charity?&mdash;"Go thou and do likewi&s;e."</P>
<P>The cities of London and Philadelphia are both famous for the humane and chari|table in&s;titutions which they contain. I think that London may adopt a &s;ociety for the al|leviation of the mi&s;eries of public pri&s;ons, in imitation of Philadelphia. (The celebrated Mr. Howard &s;aid he would have given five hundred pounds &s;terling, upon the &s;pot, for the furtherance of &s;uch a &s;ociety in London.) And in return, Philadelphia may in time, imitate London in the erection of a Magda|len Ho&s;pital.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following is taken from a London paper of February 20th, 1791.
<Q>Since the in&s;titution of the London Magdalen Ho&s;pital in the year 1758, more than 2650 women have been admitted; and we can with the greatef&s;t authority &s;ay, from a very minute in|quiry, that near two-thirds of that number have been effectu|ally reformed, and become u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</Q></NOTE></P>
