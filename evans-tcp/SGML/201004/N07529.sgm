<HEAD>THE COLONEL RECONNOITRED.</HEAD>
<P>AT length the Storm which was a-brewing is arrived; and I had Rea&s;on to expect it with Apprehen&s;ion and Terrour, for a bitter Bla&s;t it is. Notwith&s;tanding the De&s;ire I expre&s;&s;ed that the Di&s;|pute between the Colonels and me might be confined within the Compa&s;s limited by the Merits of the Cau&s;e, I perceive my Soothings and Threaten|ings were equally vain, and the Controver&s;y between us mu&s;t &s;till be not only political, but al&s;o logical, critical, per&s;onal, &s;arca&s;tical, and para&s;itical. That I may keep up &s;ome Appearance of that Method which the Colonel's exuberant Genius di&s;dains to be cramped with, and blames me both for u&s;ing and not u&s;ing, I &s;hall divide what I have to &s;ay into Sections, or Chapters.</P>

<P>The Colonel undertakes, what it &s;eems he has performed already, to make it appear that the "Twopenny Act <HI>is calculated for a very general and good Purpo&s;e to the whole Community.</HI>" Should he not have excepted Landlords, Merchants, Par&s;ons, Clerks, Sextons, poor People maintained by the Pari&s;h, white Servants, and black Slaves, or have bani&s;hed all the&s;e out of the Community before he entered upon &s;uch an Undertaking? For what very general and good Purpo&s;e could it an&s;wer to the Landlord to have his Rents made liable to be di&s;po&s;ed of by any Body but him&s;elf; to the Merchant to be deprived of the Benefit of his advantageous Bargains, and obliged to &s;tand to the Detriment of &s;uch as turn out unfavourably; to the Par&s;on to be &s;tripped of two Thirds of his Salary for one Year, and have the Whole rendered precarious for ever; to the re&s;t to be either damaged, or no Way benefited, by the Act? Whom then does the Colonel call the <HI>whole</HI> Community? No; the Act was profitable to Particulars; but it was a general Evil, by introducing or confirming de&s;potick Notions, by erecting an arbitrary Power over private Property. Had it been more cautiou&s;ly managed, and with le&s;s Inju&s;tice to Particulars, that would not have been &s;ufficient to excu&s;e the late A&s;&s;embly for a&s;&s;uming a Power to di&s;po&s;e <HI>ad libitum</HI> of private Property, not for the Sake of publick U&s;es, but purely for the Sake of taking it out of &s;ome private Hands, and lodging it in others le&s;s obnoxious.</P>

<P>Having agreed that the Burthen of maintaining the Poor ought to lie upon the whole Pari&s;h, not that the Relief of Sufferers by Accidents ought to be rai&s;ed by a voluntary Contribution, out of the publick Revenue, or by a general Tax, but leaving this Kind of Burthens to be &s;u&s;tained by the Merchants and the Clergy, he &s;ays upon my fir&s;t Remark it is not ju&s;t that poor Slaves, white Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould come in for any Share of the Benefit by the Act, becau&s;e they are all excu&s;ed from paying Tithes as it is called, becau&s;e the Act was calculated for the Relief of tho&s;e only who pay towards the Maintenance of the Mini&s;ter; and if the Act had been made otherwi&s;e, it would have been a different Thing from what it is at pre&s;ent: It would have been extended beyond what I &s;et down as its certain good Purpo&s;es. I agree with the Colonel that the Act was calculated, &s;o far as
<PB N="5" REF="009612_0005_0F76F60D7A3087B8">it relates to the Clergy, for the Relief only of tho&s;e who pay towards the Main|tenance of the Mini&s;ter; that is, unle&s;s the Poor are obliged by Law to pay more than the Rich, it was calculated for the Relief of the Rich abundantly more than for the Relief of the Poor, without any Reference to Gainers or Sufferers by Means of a &s;hort Crop, and not at all for the Benefit of the Bulk of the Poor, compo&s;ed of Slaves, white Servants, tho&s;e who are excu&s;ed the Payment of Tithes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who I think we may be &s;ure are poor, notwith&s;tanding the Difficulties and Un|certainties &s;ometimes fallen into by the Colonel about the Meaning of the Word poor, and about who are poor and who are rich.</P>
<P>So far then the Colonel and I are agreed; and it is evident, I pre&s;ume, that he means nothing by the above Words <HI>it is not ju&s;t,</HI> but that it does not come within the Scope and Intention of the Act to be&s;tow an Alms on tho&s;e who are undoubtedly poor, nay the poore&s;t Part of the Community, becau&s;e he detects the Word poor to be a comparative Term. In&s;tead of talking thus loo&s;ely, if the Colonel would have &s;poke to the Purpo&s;e, he &s;hould have proved it ju&s;t in an Act propo&s;ed for the Ea&s;e of the Poor (or for no good Purpo&s;e at all) to exclude all the <HI>known</HI> Poor from the Benefit of it, to give as much Advantage to Gainers by Means of a &s;hort Crop as to Sufferers, and to give the greate&s;t Advantages to the mo&s;t rich and flouri&s;hing Per&s;ons in the Colony, which is what I call Inju&s;tice; and however I may &s;ometimes call this Inju&s;tice the good Purpo&s;es of the Act I would not have him to be &s;o cunning as to take my Word for the Goodne&s;s of the Act, concerning which I have over and over declared my&s;elf to entertain contrary Sentiments.</P>
<P>He &s;ays the annual Allowance of Tobacco for the Maintenance of the Poor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "is proportioned according to the governing Price of Tobacco in the Year in which each Levy is laid;" and therefore, he concludes, the Twopenny Act could not injure them. But he ought only to have concluded that therefore when the Price ri&s;es between the Time of the Levy and the Time of Payment the Poor get a better Maintenance than ordinary, if no Twopenny Act interferes. Some of the Poor too are allowed Tobacco for maintaining other poor People; and &s;urely the&s;e ought to be allowed the Benefit of their Contracts when the Market ri&s;es, as well as be obliged to &s;tand to the Lo&s;s when it falls. If he would not have the Poor at any Time to get more than a bare Maintenance, then a certain
<PB N="6" REF="009612_0006_0F76F60E31E018D0">Sum of Money &s;hould be appointed for them, and Tobacco levied to rai&s;e that Money, the Surplu&s;age of Tobacco remaining every Year to be accounted for to the Pari&s;h; that if the Poor may not gain, neither may they lo&s;e by the Uncertainty of the Market. But if this is to be the Ca&s;e with Regard to the Pari&s;h Poor, then why &s;o much Indulgence to another Kind of Poor, &s;ome Favourites of the Colonels, who are not to be &s;pecified, as that for their Sakes the King's Authority, the Foundations of Trade and Property, mu&s;t be encroached upon, broken up, and removed, to enable them to di&s;charge their Debts, however contracted, without Inconvenience? Why mu&s;t other poor People be deprived of a fair and ju&s;t Op|portunity to get rid of theirs?</P>
<P>He argues that the &s;tated Allowance of the Clerk and the Sexton cannot be hurt by the Twopenny Act, except when the&s;e Per&s;ons are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no Tithables; but their Allowance is affected in the &s;ame Manner by the Act, whether they have or have not any Tithables. If indeed they have any Tithables, they are &s;o far Gainers by the Act; in which Re&s;pect they differ not from the Par&s;ons, Mer|chants, or Landlords. The great Gain of the latter, by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a Number of Tithables, was I fear a Temptation to them to acquie&s;ce under, or promote, an Act to dive&s;t them&s;elves of the Property of their own Lands; for in my Ap|prehen&s;ion, if any Body of Men what&s;oever can dimini&s;h in what Proportion they plea&s;e the Rents of Lands, and di&s;po&s;e of what is by this Means taken from the Landlords, the Property of the Land is placed in that Body, and becomes the Property of a few, which the Colonel will tell us by and by is not &s;o &s;acred as the Property of the many.</P>
<P>"In a Project (he owns) for the Relief of Sufferers by Accidents, the more any Man lo&s;es by tho&s;e Accidents the Proportion in di&s;tributing a Contribution will be, and he hopes always is &s;o." It is by no Means &s;o in the Twopenny Act: The Colonel has therefore already owned that as the Act was not made for the Relief of the ordinary and known Poor, &s;o neither was it made for the Relief of Sufferers by any Accident. What then it was made for, I think the Reader may ea&s;ily judge.</P>
<P>He detects me in u&s;ing the Word poor as a Term of Di&s;tinction between poor and rich; and adds, in Projects for the Relief of the Poor, generally &s;o called,
<PB N="7" REF="009612_0007_0F76F60EF0221520">no Man ought to be thought poorer one than another. Yet he &s;ays when "a Ve&s;try contributes to the Relief of a poor Hou&s;e-Keeper, there the Charity is proportioned to the Greatne&s;s of his or her Charge; but when it is contriving for the Poor of the Pari&s;h generally, there they only re&s;pect the Maintenance of each particular Per&s;on." If the Colonel means, by all this, that decayed Gentry, or Sufferers by Accidents, are entitled to a more liberal Allowance of Charity than the Poor who have been inured to a State of Poverty: Allowed; but then let not the decayed Gentry, or the Sufferers by Accidents, be &s;addled upon the Clergy, or any one poor and &s;mall Body of Men. Let not one &s;mall Part of the Community, in Order that decayed Gentry, and Sufferers by Accidents, may be &s;ure to be relieved, be obliged to relieve all the flouri&s;hing Gentry, and Gainers by Accidents, into the Bargain. Let the&s;e decayed Gentry, and Sufferers by Accidents, be pointed out, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from their Oppo&s;ites, and then relieved out of the publick Re|venues, by a general Tax, by voluntary Contribution, or by the more modi&s;h and genteel Way of Lotteries.</P>

<P>The Colonel tells us how an Overplus ought to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and to whom; but he &s;hould inform us how two Thirds of the Par&s;ons lawful and e&s;tabli&s;hed Stipend, of the Merchants private Contracts, and the Landlords Rents, came to be deemed an Overplus; how any A&s;&s;embly, or Parliament, came by a Right to adjudge and condemn what a&s;&s;ignable Proportion they plea&s;e of the private Property of any of their Con&s;tituents, whether Landlords, Merchants, or Par|&s;ons, whether poor or rich, to be an Overplus, and divide it accordingly among other private Men, whether poor or rich, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or &s;ucce&s;sful; and how the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch an arbitrary Power is favourable to Ju&s;tice, to Liberty, and Property.</P>
<P>The Colonel having ca&s;t off his favourite Overplus, as it well de&s;erved, "will pre&s;ently demon&s;trate that the Act was not made for the Di&s;po&s;al of an Overplus, no nor was relative to any particular Kind of Charity whatever." Had he gone no further, I &s;hould have readily acquie&s;ced, without putting him to the Trouble of demon&s;trating; but he makes an Exception of &s;uch a particular Kind of Charity, as is "founded on the true Policy of all Nations, that of pre&s;erving the
<PB N="8" REF="009612_0008_0F76F61094071EF8">greater Number of the Individuals of their Community from the <HI>Exorbitancy</HI> of the few," and &s;ays "the Act was only remedial in its Intentions (not I &s;uppo&s;e in Effect) with Regard to this Exorbitancy of the few, which naturally attends in &s;carce Years." The Colonel we &s;hall find, in more Places than one, lays great Stre&s;s upon his being ranked among the greater Number. But how comes it to be <HI>Exorbitancy</HI> in the Landlord to take his full Rents, e&s;pecially where the Tenant happens to be as great a Gainer by Means of the &s;hort Crop as the Landlord, and can well afford to pay his full Rents? What <HI>Exorbitancy</HI> is it in the Merchant to take the ju&s;t Benefit of his Contracts when they turn out favourably for him, e&s;pecially if he be le&s;s able to lo&s;e &s;uch an Advantage than his Debtor is to pay what he owes? What Exorbitancy is it in the Par&s;on to take the Market Price for his Tobacco, e&s;pecially if he cannot otherwi&s;e pay his own Debts? And why was there no Provi&s;ion in the Act for &s;uch &s;pecial Ca&s;es, by no Means uncommon? If Exorbitancy is to be provided again&s;t, why not the Exorbitancy of the <HI>many</HI> as well as the Exorbitancy of the <HI>few?</HI> Why was not there a Price &s;et upon all the Tobacco in the Colony? Why mu&s;t Gentlemen of the be&s;t Fortunes, even though they &s;hould rai&s;e as much Tobacco as u&s;ual in a &s;carce Year, and get three Times a better Price for it, be enabled to purcha&s;e the Tobacco of the Merchants and the Par&s;ons at one Third of the Value; and then &s;ell that, with their own, at the highe&s;t Price they can obtain? Is the Exorbitancy of the <HI>few</HI> really a greater Evil than the Exorbitancy of the <HI>many?</HI> And does not the Colonel him&s;elf politely tell us that <HI>Sauce for a Goo&s;e is Sauce for a Gander?</HI></P>
<P>He goes on: <Q>I &s;ay then the di&s;tingui&s;hing the Rich from the Poor, by a Li&s;t of Tithables, may in &s;ome Ca&s;es be very proper; but in this unhappy Country it &s;eems to be almo&s;t otherwi&s;e.</Q> Wonderfully gravelled here! How far is any Man wrong in judging, when the Thing of which he judges is not <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> than what he judges it to be, but <HI>&s;eems to be almo&s;t otherwi&s;e in this un|happy Country?</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> he &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>quite</HI> otherwi&s;e, and then he would have come up to the Nature of the Twopenny Act; for the Framers of that Act, by giving the be&s;t Share of their Bounty to tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t Number of Tithables, &s;eem to have judged &s;uch to be the poore&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Part of the Community, that is, tho&s;e who have the large&s;t vi&s;ible E&s;tates, to be poorer and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than tho&s;e who have not any.</P>

<P>According to the Colonel we cannot know whether the Mr. <HI>Nel&s;ons,</HI> Mr. <HI>Page,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicholas, &amp;c.</HI> Gentlemen of the fir&s;t Fortunes in the Country, be rich or poor; for who knows what Mortgages, Drawbacks, and the like, may have eaten out their E&s;tates? This is bad News for the Merchants, and a terrible Blow to the Credit of the Country; for how will the Merchants be able to carry on Trade upon long Credit, if it be impo&s;&s;ible for them to know who is rich and who poor by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of large vi&s;ible E&s;tates, and if the Colonel has given them no other Criterion by which they may obtain &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Knowledge? This Impo&s;&s;ibility to di&s;tingui&s;h the Rich from the Poor by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of large vi&s;ible E&s;tates, he &s;ays, I have allowed, by &s;peaking of &s;ome in my Pari&s;h who have but one Tithable there, and con&s;iderable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions notwith&s;tanding, there or el&s;ewhere; but with the Colonel's Leave, though the having but one Tithable in any one Pari&s;h is no certain Proof of Poverty, yet the having large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in any one or more Pari&s;hes is a good po&s;itive Proof of Riches, &s;uch a one as would content me for the Proof of my Riches, though it &s;eems it will not content the le&s;s avaritious Colonel.</P>
<P>He takes Notice of my Comment on a fundamental Pa&s;&s;age of his in a former Piece, about the general Poverty of the Country, and about the Ab&s;urdity of thinking to relieve the Poverty of a whole Country by taking Property from &s;ome poor People to give it to other poor People, every Body being &s;uppo&s;ed to be poor.</P>

<P>He complains heavily of my having mi&s;taken the Import of the &s;aid Pa&s;&s;age, and is unable to make it &s;peak any other Language that I have done; for when he &s;hould give us, what he calls the true Sen&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;age, he puts us off with telling us what it is like. <HI>It can only,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>be properly comparea to a Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;icians,</HI> &s;ome of whom &s;hall advi&s;e one Thing, and &s;ome another, about the Treatment of a Patient. Now, in the Name of Ob&s;curity, what is the preci&s;e Meaning of a Pa&s;&s;age which is like a Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;icians divided in Opinion? Tho&s;e who have Abilities and Penetration enough to under&s;tand the Colonel's ordinary Preci&s;ion and Plainne&s;s, may perhaps under&s;tand what he means by this Compari&s;on: For my Part, I &s;ee nothing here but Clouds and thick Dark|ne&s;s.
<PB N="10" REF="009612_0010_0F76F6132A1BE070">The Illu&s;tration is, in my Opinion, much more du&s;ky than the Pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf intended to be illu&s;trated. However, the Colonel, as if he had performed Wonders in the Art of illuminating, has the Courage to compare the &s;ecret and invi&s;ible Sen&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;age which he cannot di&s;cern him&s;elf, or enable others to di&s;cern, to a large Steeple for its Clearne&s;s; and the Sen&s;e, which is obvious to every Body, to a &s;mall Bird on the Top of that Steeple, for its Imperceptibility.</P>
<P>From my opening the Colonel's chief Argument, and &s;howing its Tendency to &s;upport and encourage Gaming, and all Kinds of Extravagancy, at the Expen&s;e of the Church and the Clergy's E&s;tabli&s;hment, in the Heat of Imagination he fancies that I have called him a Game&s;ter, and an extravagant, and what not; and raves accordingly about the Injury done him, in thus repre&s;enting a Man, known to the <HI>whole</HI> World (50 Miles round; that is, as much as the Colonel can in Con&s;cience de&s;ire, nothwith&s;tanding his various Publications in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Liverpool</HI>) for a con&s;tant Enemy, to Gaming and Extravagancy. Be it &s;o. If the Colonel u&s;e Arguments well qualified to &s;upport and encourage what he has a Mind to di&s;courage and aboli&s;h, who is to be blamed?</P>

<P>As if the Colonel had done nothing hitherto but flouri&s;h, he now &s;olemnly enters upon the proper Con&s;ideration of the Twopenny Act. Indeed he has done nothing more than talk about <HI>demon&s;trating,</HI> and <HI>coming to the main Point:</HI> Like a Dog in a Wheel, who is continually climbing, without &s;oaring any higher; or, that I may rai&s;e my Stile, and bring it to &s;uit better with the Sublimity of the Subject, like the Image of a prancing Hor&s;e, which never &s;tirs a Foot from the fixed Pede&s;tal.</P>
<P>He begins again with repeating that his Letter to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> is <HI>un|an&s;werable, in Point of Ju&s;tice, &amp;c.</HI> the Truth of which would have been better proved by any other Te&s;timony than his own. Pray, Gentlemen, take off his fir&s;t Piece when you buy the &s;econd: It is hard that a Man, who writes &s;o much for the Good of his Country, &s;hould be &s;uffered to be a Lo&s;er.</P>

<P>The Twopenny Act is a mere <HI>Proteus,</HI> and now a&s;&s;umes quite a new Shape; and, what is more &s;trange, &s;uch a Shape as it cannot get quit of again. For,
<PB N="11" REF="009612_0011_0F76F613D00286A8">&s;ays he, <Q>it can <HI>only</HI> be looked upon in the Light of an Aid to the royal Act; for the Scarcity of the Times (alias the Crop) had rendered the Payment of the Clergy's Salaries, &s;tipulated in 1748, impo&s;&s;ible to be made without &s;ome Compen&s;ation &s;ettled in Lieu of them.</Q> Did the Clergy &s;ue for this Aid? Were they &s;en&s;ible of the Want of any &s;uch Aid? Mu&s;t they be aided again&s;t their Inclinations? A&s;k them now concerning this Aid: Will not mo&s;t of them call it pu&s;hing a weak Man down a Precipice under Colour of officiou&s;ly &s;tepping forward to keep him from falling? I make no Doubt but when the King of <HI>France</HI> changes the Value of Money, and makes 1<HI><ABBR>&s;.</ABBR></HI> pa&s;s for 18<HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> it is always for the Aid and Benefit of his <HI>poor</HI> Subjects, and to enable him&s;elf to pay them what he owes them with the <HI>greater Facility.</HI> Might not the Clergy, if any Aid had been nece&s;&s;ary, have received the full market Price as a ju&s;t Compen&s;ation for their Tobacco? Might not their Debtors have paid them for their Tobacco what it was actually &s;old at by the&s;e Debtors? He goes on: <Q>This Compen&s;ation was <HI>attempted</HI> by the Legi&s;lature, in Con&s;equence of the Con&s;tancy, as well as Rea&s;onablene&s;s, of the Practice of &s;ettling all Compen&s;ations of a <HI>publick Nature</HI> by the highe&s;t publick Authority of that Country in which the Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch Compen&s;ation &s;hould ari&s;e.</Q> Are the defective Compen&s;ations for Rents, for private Contracts, for the e&s;tabli&s;hed Stipends of the Clergy, Compen&s;ations of a <HI>publick Nature,</HI> or proper Compen&s;ations at all? Are not the&s;e Rents, Con|tracts, and Stipends, <HI>private</HI> Property? Can any Authority what&s;oever, an A&s;&s;embly or a Parliament, in a free Government, make one Third of the Value a Compen&s;ation? Now again the Act is de&s;igned for the Relief of the Poor again&s;t <HI>Exorbitancy,</HI> under the Title of "Exactions of private Avarice." Then imme|diately it is a <HI>prodigious Difficulty to determine who is rich and who poor;</HI> and yet again we have the Poor &s;eparated from the Wealthy, and the Act is for Relief of the latter again&s;t the former, though there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the one from the other. And by this Way of talking backwards and forwards, all the Arguments in my Di&s;tinct View that have any Sen&s;e in them are an&s;wered, or, as the Colonel phra&s;es it, <HI>comprehended in An&s;wer.</HI></P>

<P>He will have it that the Nece&s;&s;ity for this particular Act, and a &s;hort Crop, are one and the &s;ame Thing; becau&s;e he &s;ays his Brother <HI>Bland</HI> could u&s;e the Term in no other Sen&s;e.

<PB N="13" REF="009612_0013_0F76F614F6A34248">Brief, or other Ways which I have mentioned, then there could be no Nece&s;&s;ity, no Occa&s;ion for any Act at all; but if there mu&s;t be an Act, and one might have been framed which &s;hould have &s;eparated Gainers from Sufferers by Means of the &s;hort Crop, Rich from Poor, Objects of Relief from tho&s;e who ought to have been found among the Relievers, then there could be no Nece&s;&s;ity, no Occa&s;ion for the Act in Que&s;tion. It is impo&s;&s;ible, I think, for the Colonel, or any Body el&s;e, to &s;how any Nece&s;&s;ity in a free Government for an Act which takes away the King's Authority, removes the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church, undermines the known Principles of Commerce, and overturns the Foundations of Ju&s;tice and Property; for, what will the Lovers of Compen&s;ations give us in Lieu of &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings? Is the temporary Advantage of &s;ome Particulars, or the Hurt of others, &s;o charming an Acqui&s;ition as to be deemed a &s;ufficient Compen&s;ation for the Overthrow of &s;uch fundamental and ine&s;timable publick Felicities?

<P>He is at his <HI>Exorbitancy</HI> again, and takes Notice of my having mentioned the Fallibility of <HI>Virginia</HI> A&s;&s;emblies; adding, that "the &s;ame Thing may be &s;aid of Parliaments any where el&s;e." Very true: I know of no Difference, in Point of Security from Errour, between the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament and the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia,</HI> but what ari&s;es from Superiority in Number, Learning, Education, Opportunities of Knowledge, and Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>in either.</HI></P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;es A&s;&s;emblies to be &s;ometimes &s;o apprehen&s;ive of <HI>Exorbitancy</HI> as to &s;et a Price upon any Produce for which it cannot afterwards be &s;old.

But will the Colonel tell me why in one Ca&s;e a Price is &s;et upon the <HI>whole</HI> Corn, in the other only upon a Part of the Crop of Tobacco?

<P>He attributes the high Price in 1758 to the Shortne&s;s of the Crop, in Oppo&s;ition to what he had formerly alleged in his Letter to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> pronounced &s;everal Times by him&s;elf to be unan&s;werable. He means that he will not let any Body an&s;wer it but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves that the Tobacco in 1758 did not &s;ell for &s;o much in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Market as in the <HI>Virginia</HI> Market. How unju&s;t and cruel then was the Twopenny Act to the Merchant, obliged to part with the Tobacco which belonged to him, which he had bought and paid for, at a low Rate; obliged to replace it at a high Rate; and obliged to &s;ell again at a low Rate! But he brings this as an Argument that the &s;hort Crop was not &s;o valuable as a plentiful One. However, he has proved afterwards that if the &s;hort Crop had &s;old as well in <HI>Britain</HI> as it did in <HI>Virginia,</HI> it would have been much more valuable than any plentiful One; and let me add, it is not peculiar to &s;hort Crops to &s;ell better in <HI>Virginia</HI> than in <HI>Britain.</HI> Therefore, notwith&s;tanding his Remark, the &s;hort Crop might &s;till be as valuable as any plentiful One.</P>
<P>The Colonel makes him&s;elf merry with my attributing any Di&s;tre&s;s that could ari&s;e rather to the Unevenne&s;s than the Shortne&s;s of a Crop, and calls it a Quibble; but in&s;tead of &s;howing that Di&s;tre&s;s comes not from Unevenne&s;s, he only contends that there may be a Degree of Unevenne&s;s without Di&s;tre&s;s, and that the Un|evenne&s;s mu&s;t be great to occa&s;ion Di&s;tre&s;s. For hear him: <Q>It can hardly be alleged that any but the covetous Hunks, or the de&s;picably Invidious, ever talked about the Largene&s;s of another's Crop, where he was not apprehen&s;ive of Di&s;tre&s;s from the <HI>prodigious Shortne&s;s</HI> of it in the Country</Q> (alias his own Plantation.) Again: <Q>No Unevenne&s;s in Crops was ever deemed di&s;tre&s;sful, <HI>without its being very &s;carce in other Parts;</HI></Q> that is, without the Crop was very uneven. Again: <Q>We can have no Idea (he the Rector will &s;ay) of
<PB N="15" REF="009612_0015_0F76F6168F244050">of Unevenne&s;s in Crops without &s;uppo&s;ing them to be large in &s;ome Places, and &s;mall in others." <HI>Yea verily.</HI> "I an&s;wer, that may be;" (&s;ay you &s;o) but the Idea then of Smallne&s;s mu&s;t be <HI>greatly lowered,</HI> as it is relative in its Nature, before we come to be <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</HI> with it." Once more: "In my Notions of Things, it (<HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI>) certainly ari&s;es from the <HI>prodigious Smallne&s;s</HI> of the Crop in <HI>particular Places,</HI> and tho&s;e not a few.</Q> When he &s;ays the Di&s;tre&s;s <HI>ari&s;es</HI> from <HI>Scarcity,</HI> he means <HI>particular Scarcity;</HI> which is what I call Unevenne&s;s, or Inequality of the Crop, if he like that Word better. When I &s;ay Di&s;tre&s;s does <HI>not ari&s;e</HI> from <HI>Scarcity,</HI> I mean the Shortne&s;s of the <HI>whole</HI> Crop taken collectively; &s;o that the Colonel here, as in other Places, pretends to differ widely from me without being able to differ with me at all for his Life: For we both &s;ay the &s;ame Thing, in a &s;omewhat different Form of Words. If this wants further Explanation, any Body I think may ea&s;ily conceive that in a plentiful Year &s;ome Plantations may be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed (in the Colonel's Language) by <HI>particular Scarcity;</HI> in mine, by the <HI>Unevenne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Inequality</HI> of the Crop: And in a &s;carce Year &s;ome Plantations may be in a very flouri&s;hing Condition (in the Colonel's Language) by <HI>particular Plenty;</HI> in mine, by the <HI>Unevenne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Inequality</HI> of the Crop. But, after all, as if he had been writing for Writing's Sake, the Colonel a&s;ks, Why &s;uch Nicety of Di&s;tinction? "What does it &s;ignify from which the Di&s;tre&s;s proceeds, the Scarcene&s;s or Unevenne&s;s of the Crops?" Ay marry, a &s;hrewd Que&s;tion! It &s;ignifies thus much, that it is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay there will be a &s;carce Crop this Year; therefore all Gentlemen Planters, who choo&s;e (as if we were beating up for Volunteers to accept &s;omething to their own Advantage) are Objects of Charity and Relief, and may be entitled to a great Bounty. A &s;hort Crop may be a Good to one, and a Hurt to another. Therefore, if the A&s;&s;embly will relieve, they &s;hould make <HI>&s;ome</HI> Difference between Poor and Rich, the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and the Succe&s;sful, tho&s;e who ought to be relieved and tho&s;e who ought to be the Relievers, to the Advantage of the former, not the latter; e&s;pecially as the Colonel does not deny but this might have been done, by Means of the publick Warehou&s;es. The late A&s;&s;embly then, in not doing this, wantonly (to u&s;e no wor&s;e Term) exceeded the Bounds of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

However, if he will return me a Compliment, by giving my Single and Di&s;tinct View a &s;econd Edition, he has my Leave to mend my Logick in this momentous Circum&s;tance; and if he will let it be a <HI>London Edition,</HI> as that &s;ounds grander, and it will be mo&s;t convenient to quote it when I write to <HI>Virginia</HI> Readers, he will for once in his Life return a full Compen&s;ation, to which there can be made no Objection.</P>

<P>Upon the Suppo&s;ition that Twopenny Acts without a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e can be defended by the <HI>mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity alone,</HI> the Colonel undertakes to &s;how that a Twopenny Act in 1755 was a defen&s;ible as one in 1758. For why? Though the Crop was much &s;horter in the one Year than the other, yet any Degree of Scarcity is <HI>a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for Twopenny Acts; nay the <HI>general</HI> Repre&s;entation of any Degree of Scarcity, whether true or fal&s;e, is a <HI>mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for Twopenny Acts. This <HI>general</HI> Repre&s;entation was a Repre&s;entation from a <HI>few</HI> Planters; for &s;ome, to their Honour, refu&s;ed to &s;ign any Petition of the Kind in 1758, as being <HI>unju&s;t;</HI> and others were never applied to; and in Numbers of Pari&s;hes I never heard that there was a &s;ingle Hand to any &s;uch Pe|tition. But &s;urely &s;ome Repre&s;entation of this Kind may at any Time be had by a Colonel from his Con&s;tituents, intere&s;ted in &s;uch a Repre&s;entation, and liable mo&s;t of them as Militia-Men to be whipped without the <HI>trifling Form</HI> of a Trial by a Court-Martial; for the Liberty, as well as Property, of the <HI>few,</HI> has &s;ometimes been held more &s;acred than that of the <HI>many</HI> by great Patriots &s;ubject to human Frailties: So that <HI>mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities</HI> for Twopenny Acts, Penny Halfpeny Acts, three Farthings Acts, or what you plea&s;e, are always ready upon Demand.</P>

<P>With Regard to the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s-Anne</HI> Act, the Colonel de&s;erts Brother <HI>Bland,</HI> gives up the Plea of Ju&s;tification from the <HI>mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity alone,</HI> and undertakes to defend that Act upon another Plea, full as valuable as the old One. Let us hear him: To have put a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e in the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="009612_0022_0F76F61CE62B4550"><HI>Prince&s;s-Anne</HI> Act, he &s;ays, would have been <HI>con&s;truing the Prerogative to the De&s;truction of the Prince's Virtue;</HI> which <HI>he &s;ticks not</HI> <Q>to define to be that Goodne&s;s which inclines him to encourage and enjoy the Peace of his Subjects, mutually &s;ettled between them&s;elves.</Q> And further he adds: <Q>I &s;ay then it is a Virtue in a Prince to acquie&s;ce at all Times in the Agreement of his Subjects among them&s;elves, in any Part of his Dominions, when that Agree|ment does not affect his own <HI>royal Right</HI> in any <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Manner, or the Re&s;t of his Subjects of his Kingdom in any Manner <HI>whatever;</HI> and becau&s;e that &s;ome Form (though extremely con&s;titutional and weighty in other Affairs, yet in this of the Agreement really trifling) was not complied with, I cannot help &s;aying that the in&s;i&s;ting upon the Compliance with &s;uch Form, for Fear of a Precedent, is to draw a Con&s;equence of Evil really from no po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on. Now as the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s-Anne</HI> Act certainly appeared to the A&s;&s;embly to be the univer&s;al De&s;ire of the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Counties, I &s;ay it mu&s;t be &s;o far from being a Di&s;re&s;pect to the Prerogative in the A&s;&s;embly, in pa&s;&s;ing it without a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e, that I cannot help thinking it to be &s;howing the mo&s;t dutiful Regard imaginable to the Sovereign, by concluding that his innate Goodne&s;s could not require &s;uch a Clau&s;e in a Thing that tended only to the Satisfaction of but a few Subjects among&s;t them&s;elves, unanimou&s;ly con|&s;enting to it.</Q> I take this Pa&s;&s;age to be a &s;trong In&s;tance of the Colonel's wrapping up warm in a cloudy Diction &s;uch Sentiments as are entertained by him, but not fit to be expo&s;ed to the Light too openly. Ob&s;erve, this is &s;aid of an Act already repealed, for Want of a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e; of an Act that was not only in Danger of being made a Precedent for pa&s;&s;ing other more injurious Acts without a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e, but was actually u&s;ed as a Precedent for pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch Acts by Governour <HI>Dinwiddie;</HI> and of an Act pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after a Petition for the Power of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch Acts had been pre&s;ented and refu&s;ed. What can we gather from the above Pa&s;&s;age but that to pa&s;s Acts without a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e, when the A&s;&s;embly think proper, and when the Bu&s;ine&s;s could have been done as well with &s;uch a Clau&s;e, is &s;howing a dutiful Regard to the Sovereign? Yes, ju&s;t as dimini&s;hing and rendering the Stipends of the Clergy precarious is a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to obtain their Dues. What can we gather from it but that if the two Counties of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s-Anne</HI> (by the Bye, I never heard that any of tho&s;e People petitioned for an Act <HI>without a &s;u&s;pending Clau&s;e</HI>) be not allowed to &s;ettle a Peace

No Wonder that the Court refu&s;ed to let the Evidence be recorded. No Wonder that there was a &s;mall Cry of Trea&s;on among the By-Standers. No Wonder that the Court, though called upon by the oppo&s;ite Pleader to take Notice of his Adver&s;ary's Behaviour, permitted the Offender to proceed in his trea&s;onable Harangue without any Reprimand or Interruption. No Wonder that though this Harangue was made in the Pre&s;ence of various Magi&s;trates, and &s;ome A&s;&s;embly-Men, yet no further Notice has been taken of this remarkable Tran&s;action. No Wonder that after the Trial was over the Pleader excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the Plaintiff for the Injury he had done him, alleging that what he had &s;aid of the King's <HI>forfeiting the Al|legiance of the People,</HI> and the ill Behaviour of the Clergy towards &s;uperiour Au|thority, was only intended to render him&s;elf <HI>popular.</HI> I hope he is mi&s;taken; and that to <HI>in&s;ult Maje&s;ty</HI> is not the high Road to <HI>Popularity</HI> in this loyal Country, whatever it may be to <HI>abu&s;e and oppre&s;s the Clergy.</HI></P>
<P>Since I have been led to make Mention of one Trial, I will not pa&s;s by the two others that have been had upon the Twopenny Act. The Event of one of them was ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of that already mentioned; for the Jury found con|&s;iderable
<PB N="24" REF="009612_0024_0F76F61E08271CC8">Damages, but the Court adjudged the Act to be Law. Ten of the Jury, were at fir&s;t for allowing the Plantift's Tobacco to be &s;ettled after the Rate of 50 &shilling; a Hundred, but by the Ob&s;tinacy of two that Rate was reduced to 37 &shilling; 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> that being found to be Sixpence more than the lowe&s;t Price given for Tobacco in that Pari&s;h in the &s;carce Year, when 52 &shilling; 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> was the highe&s;t. Many of the By-Standers, and the Jurors them&s;elves, thought that the Par&s;on ought to have, and profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves willing, to pay him 50 &shilling; a Hundred. The Jury being directed by the Court to bring the Damage in one Sum, went out and made a Mi&s;take in ca&s;ting up, bringing in by this Means &s;ome Pounds Damages le&s;s than they intended; which Errour it was alleged could not be altered con&s;i&s;tently with the Rules of the Court, becau&s;e the Di&s;covery of it was not made &s;oon enough.</P>
<P>The Event of the other Trial was &s;till different; for the Court, not choo&s;ing to meddle with the Matter at all, left the Whole of it to the Jury, who in a few Minutes after the Pleadings cea&s;ed &s;aid We find for the Defendant, without &s;aying any more. What is more ob&s;ervable is, it was hereupon entered on Record that the Plaintiff had actually received the Tobacco it&s;elf for which he &s;ued; though the Defendant attempted to prove no more than that the Plaintiff had received the Compen&s;ation allowed by the Act, namely, 16 &shilling; 8 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> a Hundred in Money. And the above Entry, it is pretended, is agreeable to the Nature of pleading. In this Trial the Price of Tobacco was proved to be 50 &shilling; a Hundred during <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> in 1758, and for Tobacco not delivered until <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> by the Evidence of Merchants of the fir&s;t Rank and Character.</P>
<P>Now of all the&s;e Affairs we &s;ay no more but that, if there be any Thing ami&s;s in them, we have the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty and Spirit to hope that it will be rectified by the General-Court.</P>

<P>He labours to &s;crew &s;ome Di&s;re&s;pect to the Speaker, out of what I &s;aid con|cerning an Application of &s;ome of the Clergy to be heard upon the Twopenny Bill; but he is not able to &s;ucceed, for he allows all that I &s;aid of this Application to be true. On the other Hand, I allow that the Speaker was a Friend to the Clergy in the Debates upon this Kind of Bills. Some of the Clergy had heard that it was the Opinion of the Speaker, declared during the&s;e Debates, that if
<PB N="25" REF="009612_0025_0F76F61EB12348E0">&s;uch Bills were to pa&s;s into Acts of A&s;&s;embly they could not be deemed Laws. And as the Opinion of the Speaker in the one Ca&s;e was &s;ufficient to deter the few Clergy on the Spot from troubling the Hou&s;e with a Petition in Form that was certain to be rejected, &s;o the Opinion of the Speaker in the other Point was no &s;mall Encouragement to the Clergy to &s;eek a Remedy el&s;ewhere. From hence the Colonel may collect that there are &s;ome that in their <HI>Hearts</HI> think in the &s;ame Manner of Twopenny Acts as the Clergy do, whom he will not dare to number with <HI>&s;hallow Brains</HI> and <HI>Grinners.</HI> And what then becomes of his fine Account of the A&s;&s;embly, in comparing them to a Pack of Hounds, and calling a &s;mall Minority the <HI>babbling Dogs,</HI> when it is evident that it may be the Lot of the able&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Men in the Hou&s;e to figure &s;ometimes among a &s;mall Minority! Nay, if I mi&s;take not, it has before now been the Turn of this leading Member, the Colonel him&s;elf, to act what <HI>he</HI> calls the <HI>babbling Dog</HI> and <HI>the angry Man in the Lobby.</HI></P>

<P>He takes Notice of the Di&s;tinction I made between Loyalty to the Per&s;on of the Sovereign, and Attachment to the Power of the Crown; and recommends it to the King to have an implicit Faith in the Obedience of his Subjects, in Op|po&s;ition to well known Facts. For I do not yet di&s;cern how the Loyalty of the People of <HI>Virginia</HI> in 1745 will prove that the A&s;&s;embly did not make free with the Prerogative in 1758, and &s;everal Times before, any more than the Illumi|nation of the Colonel's Hou&s;e for the Defeat of the Rebels by his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Cumberland</HI> will prove that the Lawyer mentioned above did not a few Months &s;ince charge the late King with having <HI>forfeited the Allegiance of the People of</HI> Virginia.</P>

<P>He affectedly laments a Piece of ordinary Ju&s;tice to the Merchants as a heavy Misfortune to his Country, but comforts him&s;elf under the Thoughts that he is too old to live long and &s;ee many &s;uch &s;evere Strokes upon his Country.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to unravel the Colonel's new Web. I have pa&s;&s;ed once through the fiery Ordeal prepared for me by him, with what Safety or Suc|ce&s;s mu&s;t be left to the Reader's Judgment; for it would be an In&s;tance of the mo&s;t unpardonable Vanity in me to boa&s;t of conquering &s;uch doughty Writers
<PB N="26" REF="009612_0026_0F76F61F78305E70">as the Colonels, who fetch their Water from the <HI>clear Fountain of Truth,</HI> deal in nothing but <HI>Demon&s;trations,</HI> and fail not to celebrate their own Victories, though they have Moderation and Genero&s;ity enough to leave the Field in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Vanqui&s;hed.

Before he entered upon the Ju&s;tification of the Twopenny Act he &s;hould have &s;ettled with him&s;elf &s;ome &s;uch trifling Points as the following: What is the certain Meaning of the <HI>Country,</HI> the <HI>whole</HI> Country, the <HI>A&s;&s;embly, Demon&s;tration, Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and every complex Term that he u&s;es; without which he will never make an able Di&s;putant.

<PB N="27" REF="009612_0027_0F76F620315B5488">to &s;ee him entangled, &s;truggling, &s;weating, &s;welling, raging, and roaring, in the Not of &s;uch unconquerable Embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>I cannot help taking Notice of two of the Colonel's grave Pa&s;&s;ages: One, wherein he puts me in Mind of the <HI>la&s;t Day</HI> of Accounts: The other, wherein he tells me that I have the Pattern of One to walk by, who when he was <HI>reviled, reviled not again.</HI> With Re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it is my Comfort that I am not to be judged by the Colonel. With Regard to the &s;econd, the Colonel tells us News indeed; namely, that my Conduct will not bear to be compared with Perfection it&s;elf. Neither his nor mine, nor that of any of our Acquaintance, I conceive, will &s;tand this Te&s;t. It is the Duty of us all to labour a nearer Approach to this Standard the longer we live, which by <HI>me</HI> (I gue&s;s the Colonel will agree to it) may be done ea&s;ily enough. But this learned Textuary &s;hould have remembered that the divine Per&s;on of whom he &s;peaks u&s;ed a con&s;iderable Degree of Severity on fit Occa&s;ions; that he advi&s;ed the Payment of the <HI>Tithes of Mint, Ani&s;e, and Cummin,</HI> when agreeable to the Laws and <HI>Stipulations</HI> of the Country; that he advi&s;ed to give <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> his Due; and even literally &s;courged the Money-Changers out of the Temple; that by his Doctrine the Performance of the greater Works cannot excu&s;e the Omi&s;&s;ion of the le&s;&s;er, much le&s;s will a &s;ingle Act of Charity, much and frequently <HI>vaunted,</HI> give any Man a Licen&s;e to be <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> in other In&s;tances; that there are Sea&s;ons when it may become a Clergyman's Duty to <HI>reprove</HI> and <HI>rebuke,</HI> however di&s;agreeable the&s;e Words may found; and that &s;uch a One is not always at Liberty to u&s;e that profitable Supplene&s;s, and tho&s;e beneficial rewarded fawning Ways, with which the Colonel may like to &s;omething <HI>about throwing the fir&s;t Stone;</HI> and perhaps, when he is calm, he will be able to &s;ee that at the wor&s;t the <HI>Reviler again</HI> is &s;omething nearer the divine Standard than the <HI>original Reviler.</HI> Upon the Whole, the Que&s;tions on this Head, &s;o far as they concern me, are Whether I have found improper Objects of Reproof in the Colonels? Whether my Reproofs have been too &s;harp, and carried to Exce&s;s, again&s;t the Oppo&s;ers of &s;uch publick Ble&s;&s;ings as a free <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject, who under&s;tands his Situation, will always value him&s;elf upon; &s;uch as the King's Authority, the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church, the Rights of fair Com|merce,
<PB N="28" REF="009612_0028_0F76F62148EC5CE0">civil Liberty, private Ju&s;tice and Property? Or whether, in the Colonel's &s;ofter Language, when he gently touches upon his own di&s;re&s;pectful Behaviour to a <HI>Peer of the Realm,</HI> I have &s;hown too much <HI>Spirit</HI> or too much <HI>Mirth</HI> in my <HI>Replications?</HI> Ob&s;erve the Colonel's Way of rea&s;oning, fairly deduced from his Aver&s;ion to be evil-&s;poken of, and from his Love of Evil-&s;peaking. The Par&s;on has a Ma&s;ter to follow, who when he was reviled reviled not again: The Colonel has no &s;uch Ma&s;ter. The Par&s;on may not be contentious, fight, or return any provoking Language: The Colonel is at Liberty in all the&s;e Points to u&s;e his Plea&s;ure. The Colonel therefore may trample upon the Par&s;on, and treat him as he thinks proper. Such are the Sentiments of &mdash; <HI>a Gentleman</HI> in every Thing but his Language, Notions, and Manners; but the Gentleman may learn, from what has happened, not to place too much Security upon &s;uch Notions for the future.</P>
<P>I thought to have ended here, but I mu&s;t not take my Leave, though only for the pre&s;ent, without having a <HI>Heat</HI> at the Pig. He &s;eems offended at the Pig's &s;queaking <HI>twice,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;elicitating him&s;elf, as he had good Rea&s;on for doing, upon its &s;queaking <HI>no oftener.</HI> When a Gentleman of <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Mirth,</HI> like the Colonel, has a Mind to carry off his Neighbour's Pig by Way of a Frolick, if it be too roughly handled, it will <HI>&s;queak.</HI> It is the Nature of the Bea&s;t, when it thinks it&s;elf in Danger of being killed and devoured, to make a piteous, grating, and ince&s;&s;ant Noi&s;e. What is to be done in &s;uch Circum&s;tances? Suppo&s;e the Colonel teach the Pig <HI>better Manners,</HI> as in a former Piece he profe&s;&s;ed the Art of <HI>teaching better Manners</HI> to <HI>perver&s;e Cows.</HI> If his Art does not extend &s;o far as to teach better Manners to unruly Pigs, and he a&s;ks my Advice in this <HI>weighty Punctum,</HI> it follows thus: Let the trouble&s;ome Pig go! Return it to the right Owner for Shame! e&s;pecially if the Owner be &s;o <HI>poor</HI> as to &s;et a Value upon &s;uch a Trifle. But if your longing for the Pig be &s;o very great that you mu&s;t &s;teal the Pig to cure the &s;aid Longing, as &s;ome Folks &s;teal Beef to cure Warts, why then ob&s;erve what I &s;ay: Hold the Pig fa&s;t by the Tail, letting its Body &s;wing thereby; which, I have good Authority for it, is not <HI>only remedial,</HI> but a &s;overeign Remedy to cure the Pig of <HI>&s;queaking.</HI> Take then the Pig by the Tail, as you did the Line which I am now going to handle: <HI>Sus atque Sacerdos,</HI> &s;ays the witty <HI>mutilating</HI> and <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ing</HI> Colonel. For why not go one Word further? What
<PB N="29" REF="009612_0029_0F76F621AEDD7F60">has <HI>hone&s;t Fur</HI> done, that he mu&s;t be excluded from the Society of his old Com|panions <HI>Sus atque Sacerdos?</HI> The whole Line in <HI>Lilly</HI> runs thus:
<Q>Ut Bifrons, Cu&s;tos, Bos, Fur, Sus, atque Sacerdos.</Q></P>
<P>Which a Boy in his Grammar, under the Care of a Friend of mine, con&s;trues backwards, for the U&s;e of the Colonel, thus: <HI>Sacerdos,</HI> a Par&s;on; <HI>atque,</HI> and; <HI>Sus,</HI> a Tithe-Pig; <HI>Fur,</HI> a Colonel who merrily &s;teals the Tithe-Pig, leaving Twopence behind him to keep the Par&s;on from making a Noi&s;e; <HI>Bos,</HI> the Colonel that roars like an Ox, Bull, or Cow, when he finds <HI>him&s;elf detected,</HI> and the Par&s;on un&s;atisfied; <HI>Cu&s;tos,</HI> the Colonel that will keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Pig right or wrong; <HI>Bifrons,</HI> the Colonel with a double Forehead, who will &s;teal the Pig under Colour of Charity, and calls it Ju&s;tice to &s;teal the Pig; <HI>ut,</HI> as; as what? Why, as the Colonel &s;ays, <HI>Sauce for a Goo&s;e is Sauce for a Gander,</HI> and may &s;ometimes &s;erve well enough as Sauce for a Pig.</P>
<P>As to Mi&s;repre&s;entation, Scurrility, Vanity, Petulancy, Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, Con|tention, Contempt of Authority, Art, Blindne&s;s, In&s;anity, Wit and Ridicule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which the Colonel condemns in the Enemy, and takes, or endeavours to pre&s;s, into his own Service, the&s;e Things may furni&s;h Matter enough for the &s;econd Part of this Review; wherein I hope to &s;how that this is not the fir&s;t Time that the Colonel has &s;at for his Picture, drawn it him&s;elf, and <HI>archly,</HI> as well as &s;atyrically, put under it the Name of his Opponent; or that he has acted the &s;at Man, who bitterly inveighed again&s;t that filthy Crowd to which he him&s;elf con|tributed more than any other grea&s;y and broiling Member of the Concour&s;e.</P>
