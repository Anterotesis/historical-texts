<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PECULIAR Difficulties and Perplexities having lately ari&s;en in &s;ome of our Chur|ches, which greatly threaten their general Peace and Welfare, the Mini&s;ters of Religion, who ought naturally to care for their State, and are under every Obligation to promote their Intere&s;t, have e&s;teemed them&s;elves called by the great Head of the Church to inquire with particular Attention into the Plan upon which our Churches were originally &s;ettled, and upon which they have &s;o many Years happily flouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>And as the Effect of our &s;erious, and we hope Impartial Inquiry, we think proper to publi&s;h to the World the following Ob&s;ervations. This we do with a View not to infringe, but to &s;tate and defend the Rights of the Churches; fairly to repre&s;ent that noble Plan of Order, &s;o pecu|liarly friendly to the Rights of Mankind, laid by our venerable Ance&s;tors, after the mo&s;t &s;erious and careful Inquiry into the &s;acred Scriptures. Our only de&s;ign has been, to find out its true Meaning; to compare its &s;everal parts with one another; to &s;hew their con&s;i&s;tency with them|&s;elves, with the Sentiments of the judicious

<P>We have no Inclination to propo&s;e any new Canon, or to impo&s;e upon the Churches any Opinion of our own. We only mean to aid the Inquiries of our Brethren into the true Nature of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, and we &s;ub|mit all to their candid and impartial Examina|tion. Whatever they find, after a &s;erious and unbia&s;&s;ed Con&s;ideration, oppo&s;ite to this, they have an undoubted Right to reject. They will, however, allow us to entertain &s;uch an Opinion of their Chri&s;tian Charity, as to rely on their kind Acceptance of our &s;incere Intention, in this Publication, to &s;trengthen the Union of our Churches, to promote their Peace, and to pre|&s;erve the good Foundation upon which they have hitherto had Re&s;t and been edified, and which we hope was laid for many Generations.</P>

<P>THE Compilers of the Platform of Church Di&s;ci|pline agreed upon Anno 1648 are evidently of Opinion, that there are no Churches in&s;tituted un|der the New-Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation, but <HI>Congre|gational,</HI> and expre&s;sly di&s;claim the name of <HI>Inde|pendents.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Plat. Cap. 2. Sect. 5.</NOTE> Now the grand Di&s;tinction between <HI>Congre|gational</HI> Churches and tho&s;e which are erected on the <HI>Inde|pendent</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts in this; The Independents manage their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs &s;olely among them&s;elves, without &s;uppo&s;ing they are under any Obligation to a&s;k Di|rection or A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other Churches: But the Congre|gational Churches, of which our Platform treats, are by our Con&s;titutions in all Ca&s;es of Importance and Difficulty, to invite the Aid and Advice of neighbouring Churches, which our Fathers held to be an "Ordinance of Chri&s;t, though not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Being, yet many Times, thro' the iniquity of Men and perver&s;ne&s;s of Times, <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the well-being of Churches, for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Truth and Peace therein."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Cap. 16. Sect. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e therefore that the Platform encourages the Churches upon its E&s;tabli&s;hment to tran&s;act their Important Affairs, without con&s;ulting the neighbouring Churches, where this Advice may be obtained, is directly to contradict the Judgment of our pious and learned Fathers upon this Point, to annihilate the Di&s;tinction which they had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed between the Churches of the Independent and Congrega|tional Per&s;ua&s;ion, to repre&s;ent the Platform as incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, to de&s;troy that Communion of Churches which they &s;uppo&s;ed ought &s;acredly to be maintained, and to de|prive the Churches of an In&s;titution of Chri&s;t greatly impor|tant to their Order and Safety.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012857_0005_0F8B9422F80E47E0">
Our Fathers were too di&s;cerning to contradict them&s;elves, and overthrow that goodly Frame of Church Government which they had erected with &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Judgment, after their mature&s;t Inquiries, on a Scripture Foundation.</P>
<P>They with great Propriety and Ju&s;tice a&s;&s;ert,<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plat. c. 8. &s;. 9.</NOTE> That neither <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> or <HI>Lay-Patrons,</HI> or <HI>Magi&s;trates, as &s;uch,</HI> have Power to appoint Officers to a particular Church. This is the unalienable Right of the Brethren by a Free Elec|tion: Yet they expre&s;sly declare, that, in the Exerci&s;e of this Right, it is agreable to Congregational Principles, "and much conducing to well-being and Communion of Churches; that, where it may conveniently be done, neighbour Chur|ches be advi&s;ed withal, and their Help be made U&s;e of."<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Plat. c. 8. &s;. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the Platform evidently maintains that every Church hath Power, in the above de&s;cribed Method, to elect and proceed to the Settlement of their Officers, &s;o it allows, that in Ca&s;e <HI>of manife&s;t Unworthine&s;s, Delinquency or incorrigible offending, they have Power to depo&s;e or remove them:</HI> But the Compilers of the Platform are &s;o far from &s;uppo&s;ing, that a Church &s;hould exerci&s;e this Power, without the Advice of other Churches; that in expre&s;s Terms they are directed to proceed in &s;o Important a Tran&s;action by Advice from neigh|bouring Churches.&mdash;This is plain from the very Words of the Platform, <Q>In Ca&s;e an Elder offend incorrigibly, the Matter &s;o requiring, as the Church had Power to Call to Office, &s;o they have Power, <HI>according to Order (the Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto)</HI> to remove him from his Office.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 10. &s;. 6.</NOTE></Q> The&s;e Words mu&s;t convince every unprejudiced Mind, that <HI>the removal of an Elder from Office, according to Order</HI> and the Method ap|pointed in our Platform, cannot be accompli&s;hed, but by the <HI>Council of other Churches, where it may be had, directing there|to.</HI> Should a Church therefore of them&s;elves, without a&s;king or receiving Advice in the pre&s;cribed Method, pro|ceed
<PB N="7" REF="012857_0006_0F8B9423773DF7C0">to di&s;&s;olve the Relation between them and their Pa&s;tor, they would not only deviate from the Con&s;titution we pro|fe&s;s to be under, but act in direct Oppo&s;ition to it. And of Con&s;equence mu&s;t be looked upon as irregular, and their Conduct mu&s;t be in an higher Degree culpable, when they proceed not only without con&s;ulting, but contrary to the repeated Deci&s;ions of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils regularly con|vened.</P>
<P>In Oppo&s;ition to what has now been &s;aid, it hath been al|ledged, that the Platform<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 8. &s;. 5.</NOTE> declares "that if the Church have Power to chu&s;e their Officers and Mini&s;ters, then in Ca&s;e of manife&s;t Unworthine&s;s and Delinquency, they have Power al&s;o to depo&s;e them." &mdash;This we readily grant; and that this Power re&s;ides in them only, and not in any <HI>Synod</HI> or <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council,</HI> according to our Con&s;titution&mdash;But then our Platform plainly points out on what Occa&s;ions, and in what Manner, they are to exerci&s;e this Power, viz. <HI>in Ca&s;e of manife&s;t Unworthine&s;s and Delinquency&mdash;a Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto,</HI> which is the only pre&s;cribed Method in which it can be done <HI>accord|ing to Order.</HI> To whom is this Delinquency or Unworthi|ne&s;s to be manife&s;t?&mdash;Is it to that Church only to whom the Per&s;on accu&s;ed belongs?&mdash;Alas! the unhappy Con|trover&s;ies which u&s;ually u&s;her in every Attempt to remove an Elder from his Office, render them too much a Party to be the &s;ole con&s;tituted Judges in this Affair&mdash;The Delin|quency mu&s;t be manife&s;t to the Council of other Churches, who are appointed to be called upon this Occa&s;ion, as well as to the Church more immediately concerned: Without this it would be the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity for the Council to ad|vi&s;e and direct to the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;This Advice and Direction being obtained, the Church proceed to the regular Exerci&s;e of their Power, and di&s;&s;olve the Relation between them and their Elder. This is indi&s;putably the Meaning of our Platform: And to take it in any different Sen&s;e is to charge it with the greate&s;t Incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012857_0007_0F8B942A1A2947E8">
Upon this Point it is very ob&s;ervable, that the Platform makes U&s;e of a very different Form of Expre&s;&s;ion, re&s;pecting the Introduction and Depo&s;ition of Church Officers:&mdash;As to the former, the Words of the Platform are the&s;e <Q>we judge it much conducing to the well-being and Communion of Churches, that where it may be conveniently done, Neighbour Churches be advi&s;ed withal, and their Help be made U&s;e of in the Trial of Church Officers in order to their Choice.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Plat. c. 8. &s;. 8.</NOTE></Q> But as to the latter, viz. the Depo|&s;ition of an Elder, the Platform ri&s;es in Expre&s;&s;ion, and u&s;es a much &s;tronger Term,&mdash;<Q>The Council of other Churches <HI>directing</HI> thereto;</Q> mo&s;t evidently &s;ignifying it to be their Mind of the Compilers, that a Church, even in Ca&s;e of incorrigible Offence in an Elder, may not, <HI>according to Order,</HI> proceed of them&s;elves alone to his Depo&s;ition, but that the Power they have, in &s;o momentous a Matter, is to exerci&s;ed under the Countenance and Direction of a Coun|cil of other Churches regularly called.</P>
<P>Our illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors had too much Acquaintance with the Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices incident to human Nature, and too warm a Zeal for the Safety of the Churches, and the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of the Mini&s;try, to leave a Deci&s;ion of &s;o great and common Concern entirely to tho&s;e who&s;e Minds may have been heated by previous Contentions, and their Judgments bia&s;&s;ed by various Prejudices and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>If this be allowed, every Church will have a Con&s;tituti|onal Right, whenever they &s;ee fit, under the Pretence of Un|worthine&s;s and Delinquency in their Mini&s;ter, after many Years faithful Service, to di&s;mi&s;s him from his Office, and re&s;ign him and his Family to &s;eek a Maintenance from pub|lic Charity.</P>
<P>What a Di&s;couragement would this be to well-qualified Per&s;ons from entering into the Mini&s;try under &s;uch a Con|&s;titution&mdash;Soon
<PB N="9" REF="012857_0008_0F8B942A4837D220">would our Pulpits be vacant, or filled with men, no ways prepared for that important Service.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, We are fully of Opinion, that it is con|trary to the Spirit and Letter of the Platform, for any Church to exerci&s;e the Power of di&s;&s;olving the Relation between them and their Pa&s;tor, unle&s;s they act under the Direction of neigh|bouring Churches, regularly called and convened, where &s;uch Direction may be obtained; and where a Church is rent with Divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, and do not con&s;ult other Chur|ches, they neglect to make U&s;e of the Remedy which our Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution hath in &s;uch Ca&s;es provided and en|joined.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not merely our own peculiar Sentiments as to the meaning of that Church-Order, which is pointed out in our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, but they are confirmed by the Suffrages of the mo&s;t eminent Divines of our Communion, who lived at or near the Time when the Order of the Go|vernment of Congregational Churches was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>We have made a careful Inquiry into the Practice of the Churches, with Re&s;pect to Church Order, which, if it hath been uniform, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a faithful Expo&s;ition of the Sen|timents of the venerable Synod who compiled the Platform, and have the Satisfaction to find the Con&s;truction we have given of the Platform abundantly confirmed by the Writings of tho&s;e Divines who were pre&s;ent at that Synod, and of the Mini&s;ters of the &s;ucceeding Age.</P>

<P>The next Authority is that of the renowned <HI>Hooker,</HI> in his Survey of Church Di&s;cipline.<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Preface, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> He ob&s;erves, <Q>That <HI>Con&s;ociation</HI> of Churches is not only lawful, but in &s;ome Ca&s;es <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> When Cau&s;es are difficult, or particular Churches want Light and Help, they &s;hould crave the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a Con&s;ociation.

<P>As we have now mentioned the Sentiments of the&s;e fa|mous Apologi&s;ts, who were not of this Country, it may not be ami&s;s to add the Opinion of the great and good Doctor <HI>Owen,</HI> on this Occa&s;ion.

It is evident from the preceding Quotations, that the venerable Fathers of the&s;e Churches, agree in Opinion, that Matters of more than ordinary Weight and Importance, and tho&s;e of common Concernment ought not to be tran&s;acted without Advice of Council. And many of them are ex|pre&s;s in a&s;&s;erting, that the Depo&s;ition of an Elder, or Pa&s;|tor, is a Matter of &s;uch Weight and Importance, as to re|quire the Coun&s;el and Advice of neighbouring Churches.&mdash; We do not find, on the mo&s;t careful Enquiry, a &s;ingle In|&s;tance of any Congregational Church from the fir&s;t Settle|ment of the Country to the pre&s;ent Day, which has depo|&s;ed or di&s;mi&s;&s;ed its Teaching Elder, or Pa&s;tor, without the Advice of a Council of neighbouring Churches; except when a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion has been effected by the mutual Con&s;ent of the Elder and Church. And, even in this Ca&s;e, it ap|pears from what has been before adduced, that &s;uch Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion is irregular, and contrary to the Con&s;titution of the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>We cannot forbear, on this Occa&s;ion, in the Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t, earne&s;tly to advi&s;e the&s;e Chur|ches, of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in this land, attentively to con&s;ider the Noble and truly Chri&s;tian Plan, upon which our Fathers have placed us; and to pre&s;erve that Uni|on, which they had &s;o much at Heart, as our true&s;t Strength and Glory; and which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the Purity of the Mini&s;try, and the Privileges of the Fraternity, both of which we are equally &s;olicitous to &s;upport; and as a &s;pecial Means of this, to &s;eek the Advice of neighbouring Churches in all Matters of common Concernment, more particularly tho&s;e of peculiar Weight and Importance, and when it is afforded them to receive it with Meekne&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ly and impartially to con&s;ider it, and not lightly to depart from it, or pertinaciou&s;ly to oppo&s;e it; reflecting how earne&s;tly our Fathers recommended this as a Go&s;pel In&s;titution for conveying Light and Peace to the Church; and what fatal Con&s;equences Inattention to, and much more a Contempt of &s;uch an In&s;titution is likely to produce.</P>
