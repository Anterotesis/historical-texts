<L>Great Nature &s;pake, ob&s;ervant men obey'd,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DIFFIDENCE ever troubles its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. It gives him mo&s;t perplexity when he perceives him&s;elf the object of public attention. The orator mu&s;t feel extremely anxious while he beholds a nu|merous audience, who&s;e concour&s;e, who&s;e coun|tenances, who&s;e very eyes, &s;eem to mark him out as the &s;ource of their pre&s;ent amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this inconvenience, common to all public &s;peakers, he, who now addre&s;&s;es you, has peculiar embarra&s;&s;ments. His theme is appropriate: he mu&s;t &s;peak on the nature of &s;ociety. This &s;ubject is far from being the mo&s;t brilliant. It does not glitter with the &s;plendour of military atchievement; nor is it &s;haded by the bays of academic fame. Might the fields of nature and art be ranged, themes could be found, who&s;e native beauty would eclip&s;e the want of embelli&s;hment, and lure the approba|tion of an audience, in defiance of every oratorial imperfection.</P>
<P>In addition to this, he cannot feel that ardour of occa&s;ion which in&s;pires the orator of &s;ome important
<PB N="4" REF="031892_0004_0FEF3145F1508AD0">
aera. We this day celebrate the birth of the Philo|logical Society. The duration of this &s;ociety is but &s;hort; the number of its members is yet but &s;mall. The anniver&s;ary of its in&s;titution, therefore, cannot be an event which very exten&s;ively intere&s;ts the world. It is not like the celebration of con|que&s;ts and revolutions, where the &s;plendour of tri|umphal heroi&s;m arre&s;ts the attention of gazing mil|lions; or where the recollection of national emanci|pation hurries the &s;oul into exta&s;y, and drives the loud echo of acclamation round the &s;ky.</P>
<P>Before this day have you li&s;tened with &s;ilent admi|ration to the oratorial allurements of tho&s;e, who, on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, have appeared in this place. After them, to gain applau&s;e, to plea&s;e, or even to pa&s;s without cen&s;ure, mu&s;t require all the powers of eloquence.</P>
<P>Forgive me, then, my fellow-citizens, if, trem|bling with diffidenee, on &s;uch a theme, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and after &s;uch predece&s;&s;ors, I attempt to amu&s;e you, by a &s;hort delineation of the evils and benefits of &s;ocial intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>We were nurtured in the bo&s;om of &s;ociety, and are, therefore, quite incompetent judges of the goods, or ills, of a &s;tate of &s;olitude. Let us, how|ever, for a moment, bani&s;h hereditary prejudice, and contemplate the goods of &s;olitude, in contra&s;t with the ills of &s;ociety; we can then better deter|mine why man for&s;ook the &s;olitary &s;tate, and mingled with his fellow-man.</P>
<P>The &s;olitary man has entire fruition of natural liberty. He is arbiter of his own actions. He knows no other law than that which the hand of nature has in&s;cribed on the pages of his own mind. In&s;tructed by this, he takes without fear or controul that portion of heaven's munifactions which the wants of his nature require. He draws the fi&s;h
<PB N="5" REF="031892_0005_0FEF314A9879EE20">
from any lake; lures the bea&s;ts and birds of any grove; plucks the fruits and flowers of any heath, and &s;lakes his thir&s;t at the cry&s;tal wave of any glid|ing &s;tream.</P>
<P>This liberty mu&s;t be dear to man; for the very child bur&s;ts into tears at the fir&s;t approach of con|troul; and men draw their &s;words, fight, bleed, and die for freedom. Indeed, heaven has vivified the human brea&s;t with a certain &s;pirit which &s;purns at the approach of &s;ubjugation, and bids its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or do homage to no being but his God.</P>
<P>This native liberty, though dear to man, mu&s;t be immerged in the tide of &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Man there relinqui&s;hes that freedom, which made him lord of his own actions; and learns to obey the dictates of extraneous &s;overeignty. He exchanges the umpirage of his own controver&s;ies, the vindi|cation of his own wrongs, for the tardy deci&s;ions of &s;ocial opinion, and the lingering reparations of public ju&s;tice. For his &s;hare of the undivided earth, he accepts that narrow portion of land, which the laws of his country have deigned to a&s;&s;ign him. While a mere citizen of the world, he was no where a &s;tranger, no where a foreigner; but, when he throws off the allegiance of nature, he in&s;tantly becomes an alien, an outca&s;t, a barbarian, in every land but his own.</P>
<P>A nearer view of the &s;everal kinds of &s;ociety, will give their peculiar evils a more &s;triking ap|pearance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ociety, perhaps, was conjugal. This is not entirely exempt from evils. The dome&s;tic &s;tate is a &s;tate of cares and perplexities. The&s;e perplexities irritate the mind, and excite conten|tions between the fonde&s;t partners. Contentions are &s;harpened by reiteration; till mutual hatred cor|rodes tho&s;e hearts, which, before, nurtured the
<PB N="6" REF="031892_0006_0FEF32D9712EDDB8">
&s;ofte&s;t pa&s;&s;ions; and reciprocal reproaches echo from tongues, once invoking the ear of heaven to witne&s;s the tenderne&s;s of mutual attachment.</P>
<P>Human imperfections &s;oon bla&s;t the unlimited confidence of nuptial lovers. We fear to lo&s;e the objects of our fondne&s;s; and that fear originates &s;u&s;picions of infidelity. Trifling accidents convert tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions into jealou&s;y, and jealou&s;y plants a thorn in every path, infu&s;es a bitter in every cup of life.</P>
<P>But had this pa&s;&s;ion been forever unknown, and had contention never di&s;turbed dome&s;tic happine&s;s, &s;till would mankind have felt enough of conjugal infelicity. It is a &s;ad truth, that the ills attendant on the objects of our love, are felt with a &s;everity equal to our own. Wedlock gives its partners each another &s;elf, equally the &s;ubject of misfortune; and thus unhappily doubles the &s;ources of human wretchedne&s;s. Care for the health, education and pro&s;perity of children, perpetually throw the minds of parents on a rack of anxiety. The&s;e cares and attachments, &s;oftening and dilating the heart, ex|po&s;e it as a mark broader and more vulnerable to the arrows of calamity.</P>
<P>All the&s;e evils are peculiar to the &s;ocial &s;tate. The votary of &s;olitude &s;hall never feel them. He, by accident, meets the counterpart of his nature in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered grove. That God, who gave them hearts attuned to the emotions of &s;ympathy, with a &s;mile of approbation joins their hands. Short is the duration of their &s;ocial intercour&s;e; too &s;hort for evils to di&s;turb the concert of their bli&s;s. Contention and reproach &s;tand afar from their happy grove, and the black fang of jealou&s;y never wounds their tender bo&s;oms. The next day's &s;un beholds them, &s;eparately, roving on their na|tive hills. Their offspring, like his parents, is the
<PB N="7" REF="031892_0007_0FEF32DC29415B08">
offspring of nature. Nouri&s;hed from the bo&s;om of his mother, and fed on the un&s;olicited growths of the earth, he &s;oon becomes independent of parental aid; and, like the mountain roe,
<Q><L>&mdash;"For&s;aken the dam's warm &s;ide;</L>
<L>"Bounds o'er the lawn, or &s;eeks the dewy glade;</L>
<L>"And finds a home in each delightful &s;hade."</L></Q></P>
<P>Civil &s;ociety &s;ucceeded conjugal. This his giv|en birth to many calamities. Men were no &s;ooner collected, than they felt the con&s;equences of aggre|gation. Power produced ambition and avidity: and the&s;e impelled men to war and rapine. United invention &s;upplied them with arms; they &s;wiftly ad|vanced beyond the line of ju&s;tice; while crim&s;on carnage, and pale deva&s;tation, &s;talked behind them through the land. Slavery and de&s;poti&s;m were the effects of conque&s;t. The&s;e calamities have been nurtured by tho&s;e cau&s;es which brought them into the world; and every &s;pecies of &s;ociety has been tormented by them, &s;ince fir&s;t old Nimrod collect|ed a nation of robbers, and, by the tye of com|mon wickedne&s;s, united tho&s;e whom God had &s;cat|tered over the face of the earth. Yes, from that fatal aera to the pre&s;ent moment, the hand of ty|ranny has &s;haken the iron &s;ceptre of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion over the pro&s;trate nations. Through Afric's &s;ultry realms, over A&s;ia's fertile plains, and back to the icy regions of the north, we now be|hold the forlorn inhabitant the unre&s;i&s;ting &s;lave of lawle&s;s &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>Even where tyranny is bani&s;hed; where the em|pire of laws is e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;till oppre&s;&s;ion cannot be entirely excluded. No code of general laws can equally embrace the multifarious rights of variou&s;|ly circum&s;tanced individuals. Some rights mu&s;t be left undefined, and without defence. This is one &s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion. Though judges are
<PB N="8" REF="031892_0008_0FEF32DEC0CD4E98">
learned, and attentive, and unprejudiced, yet &s;till will human imbecility often betray them into er|ror. In &s;uch ca&s;es the unfortunate object of their deci&s;ions is entirely ruined. He has lo&s;t even the privilege of complaining, that la&s;t &s;ad con&s;olation of the wretched. This, then, is another &s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion. If judges are ignorant, or partial, or perfidious, the weight of a &s;ingle bribe may turn the &s;cale of ju&s;tice, and condemn innocence it&s;elf to the &s;caffold. Is not this another &s;ource of op|pre&s;&s;ion? And are not war, &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, fearful calamities? Surely they are.</P>
<P>The&s;e al&s;o are calamities peculiar to the &s;ocial &s;tate. Man in &s;olitude has neither the means, mo|tives, nor di&s;po&s;ition, nece&s;&s;ary for war. No ho&s;|tile weapons glitter in his hands; no neighbour's field offers a rich harve&s;t to his rapacity; and no ambitious thir&s;t for glory has learned his &s;oul to &s;igh for martial deva&s;tation. He calls no man ma&s;ter. The yoke of va&s;&s;alage has never bent his neck; he has not felt the &s;courge of oppre&s;&s;ion; nor ever trembled at the au&s;tere frowns of tyranny. Awed by no menace, controuled by no command, he pa&s;&s;es through the world; and, as he goes, he &s;ets his foot on that &s;pot of earth which mo&s;t de|lights him.</P>
<P>Men had no &s;ooner felt the evils of civil and conjugal &s;ociety, than they &s;ighed for relief from the&s;e calamities. To remedy the inconveniences of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to advance them&s;elves nearer to their God, they formed a combination, which they called eccle&s;ia&s;tical. This, however it may have removed the ills of the other kinds of &s;ociety, has been &s;o managed, as to be productive of many calamities of its own.</P>
<P>The church has preached, that God had promi&s;|ed never to for&s;ake any who &s;tand within the pales
<PB N="9" REF="031892_0009_0FEF32E26C8BEE40">
of nominal righteou&s;ne&s;s. A mo&s;t exuberant li|centiou&s;ne&s;s has been produced by this one article of faith. Tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves &s;aints, have dared to tran&s;gre&s;s with greedine&s;s; becau&s;e their creed had taught them, that they could not tran&s;gre&s;s beyond the reach of mercy.</P>
<P>A right to &s;ell indulgences has been another ar|ticle of eccle&s;ia&s;tic combination. This, while it has encouraged wickedne&s;s, has, by gratifying avidity, produced a mo&s;t enormous avarice. So great has been this thir&s;t for gain, that the &s;ame eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who fulminated damnation at the &s;in|ner, has commenced auctioneer, and publicly &s;old ab&s;olution for every &s;pecies of wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>By thus ama&s;&s;ing wealth, the church &s;oon be|came powerful. She then &s;hut the doors of ho|nour and emolument; &s;he barred the gates of hea|ven, and un&s;heathed the dreadful &s;word of per&s;e|cution, again&s;t all who refu&s;ed to join her family, or dared to withdraw them&s;elves from her com|munion. What though the wretched object of her re&s;entment may have e&s;caped the ax, the rack, and the flames; yet, feared with the dreadful bolt of excommunication, he &s;tands the forlorn outca&s;t of earth and heaven. Human cunning could never have devi&s;ed a &s;cheme more produc|tive of hypocri&s;y. For, while admi&s;&s;ion to the church offers men all they de&s;ire; while exclu&s;ion from it expo&s;es them to all they fear; they will be con&s;trained to profe&s;s a belief in doctrines, which they never believed, and to promi&s;e the practice of virtues, which they never intend to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e calamities the &s;olitary man is a &s;tranger. No avarice bids him lure a brother into wickedne&s;s; and no fell ambition tempts him to hide the movements of his heart behind the curtain of hypocri&s;y. Though he has no page of &s;crip|ture
<PB N="10" REF="031892_0010_0FEF32E3F6874A20">
but the hook of creation; no object of ador|ation but nature's God; yet is his &s;oul not void of faith, nor uncharmed by the &s;miles of devotion. He believes his Creator gives the woods their ver|dure, and the birds their &s;ongs. He views the &s;un travelling through the fields of heaven, and calls him the me&s;&s;enger of God. When the &s;tars look from the blue battlements of the &s;ky, and the &s;erene maje&s;ty of midnight awes the world into &s;tillne&s;s, his &s;oul falls pro&s;trate before that power who bids the wheels of nature roll in &s;ilence, and lull his children to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Such are the goods of &s;olitude. Such are the evils of &s;ociety. If, then, &s;ocial intercour&s;e has given birth to dome&s;tic contention, jealou&s;y, and anxious care; if it has originated war, &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion; if it has been the &s;ource of avarice, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and hypocri&s;y, why did man, for&s;ak|ing his native liberty, native plea&s;ures, and native religion, mingle with his fellow man, and expo&s;e him&s;elf to all the&s;e calamities? A &s;olution of this interrogation induces a nece&s;&s;ity of contemplat|ing the di&s;po&s;ition of man, and his condition in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, together with a few of the benefits of &s;ocial intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>Man has an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to a&s;&s;ociate with his fellow beings. He endures nothing with more pain than he endures &s;olitude. When alone, his heart is &s;ad; and the clouds of melancholy &s;ettle on his countenance. This propen&s;ity is too violent to be allured by any &s;olitary plea&s;ure, or re&s;trained by the anticipation of any &s;ocial calamity. To throw him&s;elf into the arms of &s;ociety, man leaves his na|tive &s;olitude, barters his unviolated liberty, and encounters all the hazard, toil and danger of &s;ocial intercour&s;e. If, then, it be enquired why men a&s;&s;ociate, each one of us has an an&s;wer in his own bo&s;om. It is not becau&s;e in &s;olitude we are de&s;ti|tute,
<PB N="11" REF="031892_0011_0FEF32E70D52EB50">
fearful and defencele&s;s; it is becau&s;e we are &s;ocial beings: we love to congregate.</P>
<P>More a&s;&s;ociation, then, a&s;ide from all con&s;equen|tial benefits, affords man a high degree of gratifica|tion. It makes him happy, by removing the pain of, &s;olitude; it makes him happy, by gratifying a wi&s;h, of all the mo&s;t impatient. If, therefore, man re|ceived no other good from &s;ociety than merely the gratification of this one propen&s;ity, it would more than compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of &s;olitary good; more than balance the acqui&s;ition of every &s;ocial evil. If, in addition to this, we view the beneficent con|&s;equences of a&s;&s;ociating, we &s;hall find they afford all which man can rea&s;onably expect or de&s;ire. For his nature forbids him to expect un&s;ullied greatne&s;s of mind; nor can his condition afford him complete and inviolable felicity; becau&s;e rea&s;on and folly, virtue and frailty, good and evil, are united, and travel through the world as the companions of man. The be&s;t, therefore, which he can do, is to improve his rea&s;on, and retrench his folly; to confirm his virtue, and guard again&s;t frailty; and to follow that road through life which affords the mo&s;t benefits, and is infe&s;ted by the &s;malle&s;t number of inconveniences.</P>
<P>Social intercour&s;e we &s;ay is this road; becau&s;e it produces the highe&s;t improvement of man's facul|ties, together with the greate&s;t number of enjoy|ments. How &s;ociety can do this, is now the &s;ub|ject of enquiry.</P>
<P>Society, by multiplying his wants, calls into ac|tion the indu&s;try and invention of man; and thus enables him to produce all the great works of utility and ornament. Men had not long been collected, before they felt the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing the pro|ductions of the &s;oil. While a tribe was &s;cattered over a thou&s;and hills, the fruit of tho&s;e hills &s;upplied them with food; but when the &s;ame number drew
<PB N="12" REF="031892_0012_0FEF32E95998A878">
them&s;elves within the limits of one valley, or pitch|ed their tents on the face of one plain, their nar|row territory left half its inhabitants un&s;upplied with provi&s;ions. This want immediately evinced the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;oliciting from the earth, by labour, tho&s;e productions which &s;he would not yield &s;pon|taneou&s;ly. Here was the origin of agriculture. Men removed the rock, extirpated the oak, plowed up the plain, and clothed the field in the livery of harve&s;t. All this could not be performed without the aid of machinery.</P>
<P>The mine mu&s;t be digged, the forge mu&s;t be rai&s;|ed, the &s;mith mu&s;t blow the coals and &s;wing the &s;ounding hammer, before the ax, the plow&s;hare and the &s;cythe, could brighten in the hand of labour. The &s;ame wants, therefore, which originated agri|culture, originated all tho&s;e arts nece&s;&s;ary for its practice.</P>
<P>Men, enriched by their toil, were not long con|tented with tho&s;e habitations which &s;ub&s;erved their wants, while they roved the woods in a &s;tate of indi|gence. They pulled up their tents, demoli&s;hed their cottages, and erected buildings more durable and elegant. Here architecture had its origin. But architecture, without auxiliary arts, could not have erected the magnificent palace. Without the &s;aw|yer, the carpenter and the &s;tatuary, the arched rafter had never left its native hill; the pine's rough trunk would always have inveloped the poli&s;hed cieling; and the marble column had forever &s;lept in the quarry, nor rai&s;ed its white capital to heave aloft the gilded dome.</P>
<P>Nations had not advanced thus far in wealth, arts and refinement, without feeling wants which they could not &s;atisfy by the productions of their own climate. They, therefore, began to exchange their own &s;uperfluities for the conveniences and elegan|cies
<PB N="13" REF="031892_0013_0FEF32EC2166FAC8">
of foreigners. To perform this commercial in|tercour&s;e, caravans travelled the de&s;ert, and &s;hips &s;ailed over the ocean. The&s;e journeys and voy|ages introduced the nece&s;&s;ity of new inventions and new labour. The &s;ection of an oak, by thunder &s;plintered from its parent trunk, and thrown float|ing down on the bo&s;om of a &s;tream, doubtle&s;s fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to man the po&s;&s;ibility of journeying over the waves. From this rude hint, to form a &s;hip, with all its appendages of cordage and &s;ails, required much toil, much invention, and the united produc|tions of many arts. The brake, the wheel and the loom, mu&s;t employ the hand of indu&s;try; the ax, the &s;aw and the hammer, mu&s;t be heard to re&s;ound in the fore&s;t, before the oak of the mountain, hewn into a keel, &s;hall cleave the &s;eas; before the hemp, now green in the field, &s;hall, twi&s;ted into cables, hold the &s;hip again&s;t the fury of the tempe&s;t; or, &s;pread out in &s;ails, collect the winds, and hurry the fleet over the ocean.</P>
<P>After the production of all the&s;e wonders in the ways of art, we &s;hall, doubtle&s;s, find man advanced to an elevated grade of improvement in his rea&s;on, his ta&s;te, his pa&s;&s;ions, and in the di&s;po&s;ition of his heart. The perfection of all the&s;e depends on his connexion with the &s;ciences; and the &s;ciences &s;prang from the practice of tho&s;e arts, which we have traced up to their &s;ource among the wants ori|ginated by &s;ocial intercour&s;e. We had never known the philo&s;ophy of animal, vegetable and fo&s;&s;il pro|ductions, had not that knowledge been connected with the gratification of our thir&s;t and hunger. The arcana of mathematics had never been explored, if commerce had not rendered its inve&s;tigation nece&s;|&s;ary. The fir&s;t botani&s;t, therefore, doubtle&s;s was a farmer; the fir&s;t chymi&s;t, a black&s;mith; and the
<PB N="14" REF="031892_0014_0FEF32EEEE138C28">
merchant and &s;ailor fir&s;t di&s;covered and applied arithmetic, a&s;tronomy and navigation.</P>
<P>The&s;e rude e&s;&s;ays opened the avenues of philo|&s;ophy, and di&s;clo&s;ed on the mind a region of &s;ci|ence, where rea&s;on, by exerci&s;ing her powers, has acquired almo&s;t inconceivable acutene&s;s and ener|gy, in all her operations. By forming &s;ociety, men produced the nece&s;&s;ity of government and laws. The&s;e afforded a new field for the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on; in which the philo&s;ophy of morals and juri&s;prudence offered new &s;ubjects of contemplation, which gave additional force and &s;ubtlety to the exertions of the mind.</P>
<P>The improvement of ta&s;te is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the improvement of rea&s;on, that what perfects the one, may be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of perfec|tion to the other. The &s;ame &s;ocial nece&s;&s;ities, therefore, which, originating the &s;ciences, gave rea|&s;on its improvement, have refined ta&s;te into an ac|curate &s;tandard of deci&s;ion in all the arts of orna|ment; and by this means furni&s;hed the mind with pure &s;ources of exqui&s;ite delight. Ta&s;te has thus become the unerring director of the architect, paint|er, &s;tatuary and poet; and while it has guided the hand of the arti&s;t, it has taught the ear to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to the melody of the poem, and learned the eye to gaze with rapture on the teints of the picture, the expre&s;&s;ive features of the &s;tatue, and the &s;ublime grandeur of the palace.</P>
<P>The improvement of ta&s;te and rea&s;on refines the pa&s;&s;ions. Be&s;ides this, their refinement is an imme|diate con&s;equence of &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Society, by producing new relations, gives us new objects of attachment, and rai&s;es in the heart new pa&s;&s;ions, more tender, more generous, and more prolific of delight. In &s;ociety men commence citizens, neigh|bours, friends, parents, children, brothers; and,
<PB N="15" REF="031892_0015_0FEF32F1D0F779B0">
united by the&s;e cords of affection, their hearts vi|brate in harmonious uni&s;on with the emotions of patrioti&s;m, friend&s;hip, parental, filial and fraternal fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>The very exerci&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions meliorates and improves the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart. This im|provement is advanced &s;till farther by gratitude and benevolence. The&s;e are grafted on that mutual de|pendence which &s;prings up in &s;ociety, as its native &s;oil. In &s;ociety no one is independent. For while a man, in one re&s;pect, has the power of granting re|lief, in another, he him&s;elf may need a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Rea&s;on, therefore, directs every man to benevo|lence; becau&s;e every man knows he may be an ob|ject of it. He is al&s;o impelled to it by compa&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e compa&s;&s;ion renders him wretched until he grants relief to him who &s;olicits his charity. Grati|tude is a kind of counterpart to benevolence. It is the offspring of that gladne&s;s of heart which we feel on the reception of a favour; and which very natu|rally induces a wi&s;h to reward our benefactor with reciprocal kindne&s;s. Gratitude, therefore, as well as rea&s;on and compa&s;&s;ion, urges men to benevo|lence, that mo&s;t exalted of all human virtues, which elevates us to a re&s;emblance of Deity, and qualifies our &s;ouls for ineffable fruition.</P>
<P>All the&s;e improvements are produced by &s;ocial intercour&s;e. For without &s;ocial intercour&s;e, mens wants had never been increa&s;ed beyond the &s;ponta|neous productions of the earth; without the&s;e wants, labour had not been excited, nor invention called into activity; without the exerci&s;e of labour and invention, there had been no cultivated fields, no fruitful orchards, no ornamented gardens, no lofty palaces, no hallowed temples, no magnificent cities, no commerce travelling the de&s;ert, or &s;ailing the ocean, to pour the wealth of one climate into the
<PB N="16" REF="031892_0016_0FEF32F45B3B0DD8">
bo&s;om of another; without any of all the&s;e, there had been no &s;cience, no improvement of rea&s;on, no perfection of ta&s;te, no refinement of pa&s;&s;ions, no benevolence of heart; but the world, to this mo|ment, had remained an undivided wilderne&s;s; and man, &s;olitary man, had roamed on the de&s;olate mountains, with no other &s;ocial amu&s;ement than howling at the &s;tillne&s;s of midnight, and li&s;tening to the di&s;mal re&s;pon&s;es of echo.</P>
<P>If, therefore, all the&s;e improvements of mind, all the&s;e advancements in the arts of utility and orna|ment, are produced by &s;ocial intercour&s;e, may we not &s;ay, that &s;ocial intercour&s;e offers men the great|e&s;t number of enjoyments? Do we derive no felicity from the fine arts, from knowledge, and from re|finement of feelings? Is no plea&s;ure felt while we li&s;ten to the &s;trains of mu&s;ic; while we read the ma|je&s;tic numbers of poetry, or while we gaze on the land&s;cape, ornamented by the hand of cultivation? Who will &s;ay there are no plea&s;ures in knowledge? Surely not he who has felt the influence of one ray of that profu&s;ion of &s;cience which beams on the mind of the philo&s;opher, who has realized the force of moral truth, and enjoyed the luxury of mathe|matic demon&s;tration. Do we derive no felicity from refined feelings? Is there no delight in &s;ociability, no charm in friend&s;hip, no rapture in love? Is there no ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in beneficence, when, by a recipro|cation of benefactions, the heart is warmed with gratitude, and dilated with benevolence?</P>
<P>What &s;olitary plea&s;ures can compare with the&s;e? Can the gro&s;s fruition of the anchorite equal the re|fined felicity of conjugal intercour&s;e? Can the wild &s;avagene&s;s of natural liberty afford a delight like the &s;ober undi&s;turbed &s;atisfaction of civil freedom? Can the faith and devotion of the &s;olitary, who "&s;ees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind," &s;well the

No; even the happine&s;s of a &s;olitary angel mu&s;t &s;ink below the reach of computation, when once contra&s;ted with the felicity of tho&s;e on earth, who &s;tand within the embrace of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, and feel their &s;ouls enlarged by knowledge, refined by rea&s;on, illumined by revelation, warmed by de|votion, and united by the ties of friend&s;hip and love.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Pre&s;ident, and Philological Brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the anniver&s;ary of our Society, it cannot be improper to call into recognition the final cau&s;es of its in&s;titution. We a&s;&s;ociated for mutual improvement; for increa&s;ing our knowledge, and mending our hearts; and thus advancing our own felicity, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting our brothers of the human race. Important duties are the con&s;equence of this a&s;&s;ociation. It is in our power, and we are therefore obligated, to be more knowing, and better di&s;po&s;ed, than tho&s;e who are not of our fraternity.</P>
<P>Our in&s;titutions are calculated to forward the&s;e purpo&s;es. Our library, our di&s;&s;ertative corre&s;|pondence, our quarterly di&s;putations, and our pub|lic anniver&s;ary, are all well devi&s;ed to call up emu|lation, and diffu&s;e knowledge. A punctilious atten|tion to the&s;e articles of our in&s;titution will rapidly advance us in &s;cience, and &s;oon demon&s;trate to the world that our preten&s;ions are not merely nominal.</P>
<P>Something, however, be&s;ides &s;cience, is nece&s;&s;a|ry to con&s;titute a good philologian. He mu&s;t im|prove in virtue, as well as knowledge; nor neglect
<PB N="20" REF="031892_0019_0FEF32FDDCE7DB48">
the felicity of others, while he attends to his own. Much of all this is con&s;tantly within our power. We know a habit of doing well re&s;ults from the practice of virtue; and this habit, confirmed by reiteration, will be the guardian of our &s;ouls, when vice hangs out her fa&s;cinating lure; and the whi&s;per of frailty, or the clamour of pa&s;&s;ion, bids us follow her &s;e|ducing charms.</P>
<P>Every day affords us opportunity to increa&s;e the joy, or dimini&s;h the grief of a fellow mortal. Some one may want our coun&s;el, our in&s;truction, our charity, our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or our con&s;oling &s;ym|pathy. We may direct inexperience, relieve want, &s;upport infirmity, and pluck the thorn of grief from the pillow of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is not one of us but who&s;e example is in|fluential in the world. All this influence we ought to enli&s;t on the &s;ide of virtue. We &s;hould patron|ize indu&s;try, as a &s;ource of wealth, ornament and knowledge; we &s;hould bani&s;h indolence, as the prolific parent of poverty, ignorance, vice and mi|&s;ery. Our conduct &s;hould evince that we mea&s;ure our actions by the rules of virtue, and revere the awful &s;anctions of religion. We &s;hould never look with approbation on fraud, or deceit, or treache|ry; nor, without the mo&s;t &s;overeign indignation, behold the bla&s;phemous &s;near of infidelity. We ought to regard religion as the &s;ource of national peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s. We know its &s;anctions give energy to the public voice. We know its promi&s;es add a new delight to pre&s;ent joy, and bid wretchedne&s;s anticipate a region where &s;he &s;hall never hear a &s;igh, nor &s;ee a tear. We ought, therefore, to regard him, who would le&s;&s;en the influence of religion, as one di&s;po&s;ed to relax the laws, to dimini&s;h the plea&s;ures and multiply the mi&s;eries of life.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="031892_0020_0FEF32FF6FBD1990">
We &s;hould con&s;tantly labour for a removal of tho&s;e calamities which are the imperfection of &s;oci|ety. Though we cannot pluck out the fang of jealou&s;y, nor unlock the chain of &s;lavery, nor &s;oothe the rage of war, nor break the wheel of per&s;ecution; yet can we often hu&s;h dome&s;tic con|tention, often lighten the load of oppre&s;&s;ion, and often tear away the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, and &s;how the world the di&s;torted vi&s;age of &s;anctified wicked|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e things we are urged by the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting motives. Virtue and knowledge delight the mind, and elovate the character. They not only confer a dignity and reputation on their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, which converge the beams of glory round his head; but they al&s;o approximate him towards the nature of tho&s;e cele&s;tials that &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of Him who&s;e knowledge is omni&s;cience, who&s;e goodne&s;s knows no limitation.</P>
<P>We are this day, my brethren, &s;urrounded by a numerous concour&s;e of our follow-citizens. For this honorary attention, we owe them a tribute of gratitude, which we cannot di&s;charge unle&s;s by the mo&s;t vigorous exertions for the benefit of our common country.</P>
<P>In Europe, and in the United States, are many in&s;titutions &s;imilar to our own. Let us emulate them, in &s;cience, in virtue, in religion; and, unit|ing our exertions with tho&s;e of our &s;i&s;ter in&s;titu|tions, improve the genius of our country, and ele|vate Columbia to a model for the world.</P>
<P>The infancy of our in&s;titution calls on us for more than parental care, anxiety and ardour, to nurture its tender growth into an athletic maturity. While we feel this, let us remember, that the greate&s;t things, both in the natural and &s;ocial world, have originated from the &s;malle&s;t. Yes; the oak,
<PB N="22" REF="031892_0021_0FEF330113BE4A70">
who&s;e trunk &s;tands unbent again&s;t the tempe&s;t, who&s;e branches are the habitation of the eagle, was once an embryo in the acorn. The Nile rolls down a copious &s;tream, and fertilizes the fields of Egypt, while mountain &s;howers, and &s;olitary fountains, are its &s;ource. Rome and Greece, who&s;e philo&s;ophers, orators and poets, have held aloft the glory of their country, and arre&s;ted the gazing eyes of admiring po&s;terity, were, at fir&s;t, but wan|dering hordes of hunters and &s;hepherds. The pri|mitive followers of that religion who&s;e precepts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Give men &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as they will po&s;&s;e&s;s in the millennium. This word is coined according to the direction of Demetrius Phalerius on Elocution, &s;ec. 96.</NOTE> millennialize the world; who&s;e promi&s;es break up the iron bedchambers of death, and emancipate the buried nations; who&s;e votaries &s;hall e&s;cape the depredations of ages, and &s;hine in renovated glory, when the &s;un &s;hall have lo&s;t its &s;plendour; the fol|lowers of this religion were, once, but few in num|ber, but &s;mall in power, and pa&s;t the world with|out a &s;helter from the &s;torms, or a pillow for re|po&s;e. Let us, my brothers, think on the&s;e things; and if we &s;upport our in&s;titution by pur&s;uing &s;ci|ence, by practi&s;ing virtue, by feeling religion, we may anticipate the time when the name of Philolo|gian &s;hall be the panegyric of greatne&s;s.</P>
