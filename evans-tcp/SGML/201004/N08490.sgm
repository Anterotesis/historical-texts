<HEAD><HI>The AMERICAN</HI> WHIG. [NUMB. I.]</HEAD>
<P>BY this time I &s;uppo&s;e, Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s <HI>Appeal</HI> has &s;afely cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic; and if properly introduced to his &s;uperiours with tho&s;e u&s;ual private advices of his brethren on this &s;ide the water (which for a particular rea&s;on, it is their intere&s;t &s;hould ever remain private) of what &s;uc|ce&s;s it promi&s;es to the cau&s;e of Epi&s;copacy in America; and how by the aid of a Bi&s;hop it is like to expand the gentle bo&s;om of the church, &s;o as to receive thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of Fanatics, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, Methodi&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, Iroqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Indians, and We&s;t-India Blacks. If this, I &s;ay, hath been properly managed, it will doubt|le&s;s an&s;wer what without breach of charity, we may &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t a &s;econdary motive of the reverend author in compo&s;ing it; namely, to demon&s;trate to his benefactors, that his doctrine hath not been be&s;towed in vain. It certainly breaths a noble zeal for the church. Nay, in by and through the church, and &s;o far as &s;he is concerned in the premi&s;es, it &s;eems to breath a zeal for religion it &s;elf. It proves, moreover, what all the Di&s;&s;enters have always a&s;&s;erted; and what the Doctor and all his brethren have always denied&mdash; that the church of England in America, for want of the grand e&s;&s;ential, for which the poor gentleman is now breaking his heart, never was the church of England but an independent church. It &s;hews farther, what indeed doth not carry with it &s;o clear a con|viction, that though this church hath hitherto been an epi&s;copal church, and always well governed; it hath neverthele&s;s never been an epi&s;copal church; nor ever been governed at all. It &s;a|gaciou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hes between a primitive <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and a modern <HI>Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop.</HI> It a&s;&s;umes an unu&s;ual moderation; and &s;o na|turally counterfeits the voice of a &s;heep, that it is not every reader who will di&s;criminate it from that of a wolf. In fine, it be|moans, with deeper moans, than any of the mo&s;t moanful &s;hep|herds in pa&s;toral, the numberle&s;s &s;ouls already peri&s;hed through the neglect of his all important plan; and congratulates po&s;terity,
<PB N="4" REF="010857_0003_0F8524CD5577C5F8">if not the hopes of re&s;cuing them out of purgatory, at lea&s;t on the pro&s;pect of &s;peedily introducing a kind of millenium, by the epi&s;copal triple di&s;charge of <HI>ordination, confirmation</HI> and <HI>govern|ment,</HI> by virtue of which are to be converted Jews and Infidels, together with all and &s;ingular the Whites, Blacks and Browns, farther than from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beer&s;heba,</HI> even from Lake <HI>Superiour</HI> to <HI>Pen&s;acola.</HI></P>

<P>By this time al&s;o, 'tis probable the author begins to plume him|&s;elf on the &s;uppo&s;ed unan&s;werablene&s;s of his performance; for he takes his leave, courteous reader with &s;o terrific a defiance as though he was in very deed the Goliah of the fraternity; and would devour all his opponents like &s;o many &s;tripling Davids, at a &s;ingle breakfa&s;t. Nay, I &s;hould not marvel if he had already drawn that marvellous conclu&s;ion, which by a new &s;pecies of lo|gic, is infallibly to follow from &s;uffering his appeal to remain unan&s;wered; I mean, that in &s;uch ca&s;e all the world mu&s;t be pre|&s;umed to acquie&s;ce in his propo&s;al: That is, in plain Engli&s;h, every man mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to adopt the principles contained in every book, how ab&s;urd &s;oever he conceives them, unle&s;s he puts him&s;elf to the trouble of writing another book again&s;t it. Would not the Doctor think it hard to be thought a Romani&s;t, merely becau&s;e he has never publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to <HI>Cardinal Bellarmine?</HI> And is not this &s;ingle que&s;tion a full refutation of his darling in|ference? For my own part, with re&s;pect to any execution this re|markable performance is like to do among our&s;elves, where almo&s;t every intelligent reader is able, from his own per&s;onal knowledge, to contradict the facts upon which great part of it, and by far the mo&s;t plau&s;able part, is &s;ounded; I &s;hould have been very willing to leave the author to triumph in his imaginary victory. But when I con&s;ider, that it will chiefly be read in a country, where, with a moderate &s;hare of addre&s;s, people may be made to believe, that a man can jump into a quart bottle&mdash;that thou&s;ands of Ne|groes who never &s;o much as heard the Go&s;pel are notwith&s;tanding <HI>virtual Churchmen</HI>&mdash;that what mu&s;t inevitably ruin a country, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to its welfare; and that le&s;s than half a mil|lion, is in reality three millions and more: When I reflect, I &s;ay, what pernicious con&s;equences may be apprehended from even &s;o &s;lim&s;ey a compo&s;ition, among a people who either have no oppor|tunity of knowing, or will not be at the pains of inquiring into the truth of certain facts, as confidently a&s;&s;erted in the pamphlet, as if univer&s;ally known to be true, when they are almo&s;t univer&s;ally known to be otherwi&s;e; I cannot but think it my duty, to admi|ni&s;ter an antidote to the poi&s;on: and to &s;hew as well the fal&s;ity of the facts, as the futility of the rea&s;oning, by which <HI>the appeal</HI> may
<PB N="5" REF="010857_0003_0F8524CD5577C5F8">impo&s;e on the weak and credulous. I &s;hall therefore, without any apology of this man's <HI>having a tremor in his hand,</HI> or that one a torpor in his head, think my&s;elf &s;ufficiently authorized as a friend of truth and of &s;ociety, to prevent to the utmo&s;t of my power, the fatal, the tremendous mi&s;chiefs, which the <HI>appeal</HI> is &s;o artfully calculated to introduce; but in the cour&s;e of my &s;peculations, I &s;hall not think my&s;elf obliged &s;crupulou&s;ly to adhere to the me|thod ob&s;erved by the reverend Doctor. So &s;y&s;tematical an attach|ment would perhaps not be reli&s;hed in a number of weekly papers, which mu&s;t from their re&s;pective conci&s;ene&s;s, nece&s;&s;arily require too many pau&s;es for a work of that nature. Be&s;ides, to relieve thy &s;pirits, gentle reader, I &s;hall often be obliged to quit the more &s;o|lemn and polemic, for the gayer and more airy parts of the Doc|tor's lucubration. By this means thou wilt be enabled, after a &s;hort and refre&s;hing interlude, to return with a keener appetite, to the dry cru&s;t of un&s;avoury controver&s;ey. I &s;hall think my&s;elf even at liberty, &s;hould &s;uch a mea&s;ure appear mo&s;t conducive to thy edification or entertainment, to fall directly upon the centre, and &s;o to move towards front or rear, as occa&s;ion requires. Nay I do not intend, by any preliminary engagements, to re&s;ign my right of beginning with the <HI>Nag's-head,</HI> and concluding with the preface. I &s;hall, not with&s;tanding this my <HI>non-conformity</HI> to <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hed</HI> method fully con&s;ider every part of the pamphlet that re|&s;pects the merits of the cau&s;e; or has the lea&s;t tendency to intro|duce an evil more terrible to every man who &s;ets a proper value either on his liberty, property or con&s;cience, than the &s;o greatly and de&s;ervedly obnoxious &s;tamp-act it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the encroachments that have lately been made on our civil liberties; and that we can &s;carcely obtain redre&s;s again&s;t one injurious project, but another is forming again&s;t us&mdash;con&s;i|dering the poverty and di&s;tre&s;s of the colonies by the re&s;trictions on our trade; and how peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary it is, in the&s;e times of common calamity, to be united among&s;t our&s;elves; one could &s;carcely have imagined, that the mo&s;t ambitious eccle&s;ia&s;tic &s;hould be &s;o indifferent about the true intere&s;t of his native country, as to &s;ow, at this critical juncture, the &s;eeds of univer&s;al di&s;cord; and be&s;ides the deprivation of our civil liberties, lend his helping hand to involve us in eccle&s;ia&s;tical bondage into the bargain. Is this a time to think of epi&s;copal palaces, of pontifical revenues, of &s;pi|ritual courts, and all the pomp, grandeur, luxury and regalia of an American Lambeth? 'Tis true, the pamphlet is &s;pecious, and appears to a&s;k nothing but what is highly rea&s;onable: and could any man, above the capacity of an Ideot, really per&s;uade him&s;elf, the <HI>Doctor</HI> and the <HI>Convention</HI> would content them&s;elves with a Bi&s;hop, &s;o limited and curtailed as be is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent his future Lord&s;hip; it were manife&s;t inju&s;tice to deny them what in their
<PB N="6" REF="010857_0004_0F8524CE47CBB658">opinion their eternal &s;alvation &s;o greatly depends upon. But it is not the <HI>primitive Chri&s;tian</HI> Bi&s;hop they want. It is the <HI>modern, &s;plendid, opulent, court favoured, law-dignified, &s;uperb, magnifi|cent, powerful</HI> prelate, on which their hearts are &s;o intent. And that &s;uch a Bi&s;hop would be one of the wor&s;t commodities, that can po&s;&s;ibly be imported into a new country, and mu&s;t inevitably prove ab&s;olute de&s;olation and ruin to this, I &s;hall abundantly evince in the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;peculations.</P>

<HEAD>THE AMERICAN WHIG. [NO. II.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the re&s;pectable Public in America.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE>March 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS civil and religious liberty is the foundation of public happi|ne&s;s, and the common birth-right of mankind, it is the duty and intere&s;t of every individual, to keep a watchful eye over, and to cheri&s;h it with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s. Would we pre|&s;erve the invaluable jewel, and act the part of true friends to our country, we ought to maintain a &s;acred jealou&s;y, that it be not ravi&s;hed from us by open violence, nor undermined by &s;ecret arti|fice and fraud. The mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of danger will alarm; and every attempt to rob us of our privileges, however artfully di&s;gui&s;ed, or varni&s;hed over with the &s;pecious pretence of public utility, will awaken our fears, and put us upon our guard. Nor indeed, without the highe&s;t rea&s;on, as the greate&s;t danger ari&s;es from this quarter. So jealous and tenacious are mankind of their liberty, thet every attempt to deprive them of it, by open violence is generally fruitle&s;s. A direct attack will be re&s;ented, and repelled with heroic bravery; and next to life and property, men will mo&s;t zealou&s;ly contend for its pre&s;ervation. Con&s;cious of this, tho&s;e in all ages, who have commenced tyrants, and undertaken to en&s;lave mankind, have ever had recour&s;e to artifice; and under pretext of the public good, have, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, introduced alte|rations into the civil and religious con&s;titutions of their country; till the deluded people are gradually wormed out of their liberty, and at la&s;t find the &s;hackles of &s;lavery effectually rivetted.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, every new project propo&s;ed to the public, every attempted innovation, ought to be critically canva&s;&s;ed and examined, even in their remote&s;t tendency and con&s;equences; and adopted, if at all, with the utmo&s;t caution and re&s;erve. Barely the novelty of any propo&s;al is, in this light, &s;ufficient to alarm our jealou&s;y, and excite our vigilance. However plau&s;ible it may ap|pear at fir&s;t view, or di&s;gui&s;ed with the colourable pretence of be|ing friendly to liberty, and promotive of public happine&s;s; if we ha&s;tily acquie&s;ce in, or without examination ra&s;hly receive it, we
<PB N="7" REF="010857_0004_0F8524CE47CBB658">&s;hall probably lament our folly; and when too late, feel the fatal effects of our temerity.</P>
<P>What led me into the&s;e reflections was the reading Dr <HI>Chandler</HI>'s plea for an <HI>American epi&s;copate,</HI> lately publi&s;hed in New-York.</P>
<P>The Scheme for &s;ending Bi&s;hops into the colonies, has it &s;eems been long under con&s;ideration. 'Tis above fifty years &s;ince it was fir&s;t &s;tarted; and &s;ome provi&s;ion made for carrying it into execu|tion. It has been lately revived, and we hear, the advocates for it, both here and in England, have &s;anguine expectations of its &s;peedy accompli&s;hment. This revival of the project the <HI>Doctor</HI> tells us is in con&s;equence of &s;ome late applications from the&s;e parts. No le&s;s than &s;even petitions we are told, have been tran&s;mitted by a certain convention of the epi&s;copal clergy here, to &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;onages in England, earne&s;tly &s;oliciting Bi|&s;hops for America; repre&s;enting the deplorable condition of an unmitred church; boa&s;ting of their incredible numbers in the colonies; their di&s;tingui&s;hed and un&s;haken loyalty, and not &s;pa|ring very injurious reflections upon, the other denominations, as &s;editious incendiaries, and di&s;affected to the king and government. With what truth the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions are ca&s;t upon you, <HI>my dear coun|trymen,</HI> and why at this juncture &s;o vehemently urged, you mu&s;t judge for your&s;elves. If they are ju&s;t, and you are indeed &s;uch factious incendiaries, &s;uch di&s;loyal &s;ubjects to the be&s;t of Kings as the&s;e addre&s;&s;es are &s;aid to in&s;inuate, it highly concerns you to re|pent and reform: If not you will re&s;ent them in a manner becom|ing an injured people con&s;cious of their own innocence, when ba&s;ely and fal&s;ely traduced.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctor</HI> calls his piece, <HI>an appeal to the public in behalf of the church of England;</HI> and as the grand de&s;ign of it is to &s;olicit an American epi&s;copate, &s;ome may doubt the propriety of the title; and be at a lo&s;s what, in this ca&s;e he means by appealing to the public. It is now generally known, that the mini&s;try in England have rejected the propo&s;al. As they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the &s;entiments of their royal ma&s;ter, this mu&s;t be con&s;trued a de|nial from the throne. Surely the <HI>Doctor</HI> means not to affront his Maje&s;ty, by appealing from the King to the people. To remove his &s;uit from the &s;overeign to the &s;ubject, as to a higher tribunal. This would by no means comport with his profe&s;&s;ed loyalty; or be con&s;i&s;tent with that zeal for the con&s;titution and government at home, to which he and his brethren avow &s;o warm an attachment. And yet, if this be not his meaning, it mu&s;t be &s;omething very like it. Why el&s;e &s;hould he talk of appealing to the public? Why lay his grievances before the people; and expre&s;sly invite all objec|tors to propo&s;e their objections, to be freely and candidly debated before the tribunal of the public?</P>
<P>We have been told, that in an&s;wer to tho&s;e petitions of the
<PB N="8" REF="010857_0005_0F8524CEF73FFF48"><HI>Doctor</HI> and his brethren, they have been ordered to be &s;ilent; to de&s;i&s;t from future applications on the &s;ubject; and to leave the affair to the conduct of their &s;uperiours. Whether it was becau&s;e the petitions were thought a little too pragmatical and a&s;&s;uming; or to contain &s;omething too warm and petulant, has not yet ap|peared. Be that as it will, it may perhaps not be ami&s;s for the <HI>Doctor</HI> a little to con&s;ider, how far he approves him&s;elf an obedi|ent &s;on of the church, in counteracting tho&s;e orders; and in what light his appeal will in con&s;equence be received at home.</P>
<P>However, as he and his brethren have &s;een &s;it, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, to put the ca&s;e upon this i&s;&s;ue.&mdash;As they have in fact appealed from the judgment of the King and his mi|ni&s;ters, &amp;c. to the people; and in form &s;ubmitted their cau&s;e to the hearing and deci&s;ion of the public; we &s;hall readily follow them to this re&s;pectable tribunal, in full confidence of a ju&s;t and equitable determination.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then &s;ubmitted to you, <HI>my dear countrymen,</HI> is briefly this, viz. Whether it is rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, that a number of Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to re&s;ide, and exerci&s;e their functions in the&s;e American colonies; and whether the Church of England here, is really in a &s;tate of per&s;e|cution, for want of &s;uch Bi&s;hops? That you, <HI>my re&s;pectable judges,</HI> may be able to determine the ca&s;e impartially, the arguments ad|vanced by the <HI>Doctor</HI> in &s;upport of the mea&s;ure, &s;hall be fully con&s;idered, and the objections again&s;t his &s;cheme, candidly and fairly &s;tated. But as the limits allowed me, will not admit of this at pre&s;ent, it mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of &s;ome future papers.</P>

<HEAD>From the NEW-YORK GAZETTE, MARCH 21. An Adverti&s;ement to the <HI>PUBLIC.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE principal de&s;ign of the <HI>appeal to the public</HI> was, to a&s;|&s;ign the rea&s;ons for which the members of the church of England in America, are de&s;irous of having Bi&s;hops to re&s;ide in this country, to &s;tate and explain the plan on which alone Ameri|can Bi&s;hops have been propo&s;ed and reque&s;ted, and to obviate and confute the objections, that might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e in the minds of any again&s;t &s;uch an epi&s;copate. Whether the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned are not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the late application of the clergy for Bi&s;hops, whether the nature of the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate is not hone&s;tly and fairly repre&s;ented and explained, and whether the mo&s;t con&s;iderable objections again&s;t it are not obviated and con|futed in <HI>the appeal,</HI> is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the <HI>reader</HI>&mdash; but N. B. not one of tho&s;e who are not readers of the pamphlet. The author was, and is, fully per&s;uaded of the goodne&s;s of the
<PB N="9" REF="010857_0005_0F8524CEF73FFF48">cau&s;e which he undertook to plead; and, although &s;en&s;ible of his inability to do it ju&s;tice, he had the vanity to think him&s;elf able to &s;atisfy the public, as to the main points on which it depended. With this opinion he entered upon the work, and in the execution of it he was particularly careful to avoid giving offence, and to treat every denomination of Chri&s;tians, every &s;et of men whom he had occa&s;ion to mention, with great tenderne&s;s and all proper re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The <HI>appeal</HI> upon its fir&s;t publication, was received as favourably as the author could expect; &s;everal per&s;ons, of different principles and characters, who conde&s;cended to read it, being then plea&s;ed to te&s;tify their general approbation of the performance. If it has been treated by &s;ome per&s;ons latterly in a different manner, perhaps it has been owing to motives that have occurr'd &s;ince the time of its publication. A general attack from different quarters has been, at length, projected, and &s;ome of the combatants begin to &s;hew them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The author is not unwilling to re-examine any thing that has been advanced or a&s;&s;erted in the cour&s;e of the <HI>appeal,</HI> and to have the &s;ubject "fairly and candidly debated, before the tribunal of the public," being &s;till of opinion, that the plea for American Bi&s;h|ops, the more clo&s;ely it is examined, and the better it is under|&s;tood, will appear proportionably to greater advantage. Whate|ver therefore &s;hall be offered on the &s;ubject in a rea&s;onable and decent way, he thinks it his duty to attend to&mdash;but to nothing far|ther. As to per&s;onal abu&s;e, he thinks he does not de&s;erve it, even from the enemies of an American Epi&s;copate, to whom he has be|haved re&s;pectfully; and he is determined not to regard what every innocent and hone&s;t man ought to de&s;pi&s;e. But although he con|&s;ents to debate matters with any one, who has the appearance and manner of a gentleman; yet he choo&s;es not to enter the li&s;ts, in a match of flinging dirt, with &s;crubs and &s;cavengers.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e characters the <HI>American Whig</HI> (for America has whigs) will think proper to appear in, can hardly be judged from his fir&s;t exhibition; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay that I look upon his &s;ymptoms to be rather unfavourable. I have al&s;o been told by &s;ome who pretend to know him, that this &s;ame <HI>Whig</HI> (who by the bye is repre&s;ented to have as many heads as the mon&s;ter <HI>Hydra</HI>) is vio|lently enraged at <HI>Somebody</HI> and <HI>Something,</HI> and has &s;worn revenge upon me. If &s;o, in what manner I &s;hall be treated, may be ea&s;ily conjectured. But why &s;hould I be &s;ingled out as a mark of his re&s;entment? If &s;ome people <HI>have</HI> failed in their application for a <HI>charter,</HI> and have been di&s;appointed in the late <HI>election,</HI> how can I help it? The&s;e are no affairs of mine, and I am not an&s;werable for them.</P>
<P>I make it a general rule to my&s;elf, to treat all per&s;ons with as
<PB N="10" REF="010857_0006_0F8524CF1C96A250">much notice and re&s;pect as they de&s;erve. Upon this principle I propo&s;e to conduct my&s;elf towards the <HI>American Whig;</HI> &s;o that what treatment he is to receive from me, will depend greatly upon his future behaviour. So far as he &s;hall rea&s;on, or &s;hall appear to think that he rea&s;ons, he will have a claim to my notice; &s;o far as he &s;hall rail, he will be beneath it. Not a &s;ingle argument that is pertinent to the &s;ubject, &s;hall e&s;cape my attention; and, if it plea&s;es God to continue my health, I will either confe&s;s its force, or &s;hew its weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>But he mu&s;t excu&s;e my not attending him in a weekly paper. For &s;uch a ta&s;k I cannot always promi&s;e my&s;elf lei&s;ure; and, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, I have no great inclination. Some of my objections again&s;t this mode of defence are the following.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. I cannot engage with him upon equal terms. If I appear in this way, it mu&s;t be in my own per&s;on; but my opponent is covered with a ma&s;k (and for a particular <Q>rea&s;on it is his intere&s;t that he &s;hould remain for ever ma&s;ked</Q>) and an engagement by two per&s;ons under &s;uch different circum&s;tances, would afford to the public an odd &s;pectacle. While I &s;hould ri&s;que my own cha|racter and reputation in the fray, I know not until I can di&s;co|ver the real features of my antagoni&s;t, whether he has any repu|tation and character to ri&s;que. For this rea&s;on it has been gene|rally e&s;teemed ba&s;e and ungenerous, for a writer who di&s;gui&s;es or conceals him&s;elf, to attack an author who &s;tands fairly upon open ground. Such a method of carrying on ho&s;tilities has been looked upon as a &s;ort of literary bu&s;h fighting, to which it is almo&s;t as incon&s;i&s;tent with prudence to expo&s;e one's &s;elf, as it is with ho|nour to practice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly. There appears to me to be a great unfitne&s;s and impro|priety in &s;uch a conte&s;t, on other accounts. The <HI>Appeal,</HI> agree|ably to the importance of its &s;ubject, was written with real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; and the defence of it, when undertaken by its author, ought to be carried on in the &s;ame manner. But the at|tack of our <HI>Whig,</HI> is like to be conducted with a very different &s;pi|rit. No. I. from which we mu&s;t at pre&s;ent judge, is penned alto|gether in a ludicrous &s;train; it is thickly be&s;pangled with drolle|ry, it frequently fla&s;hes with wittici&s;ms (but ob&s;erve <HI>gentle reader,</HI> they are of a &s;purious breed,) and in &s;hort, ridicules the general &s;ubject of the Appeal and its various parts. Now as this has ne|ver been allowed to be the faire&s;t method of dealing with any thing that is &s;erious, &s;o &s;erious an&s;wers to funny writers, like throwing pearls before a certain kind of animals, are looked upon as impro|perly applied; and yet none but &s;erious an&s;wers, as has been &s;aid, doth it become the author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> to give. He propo&s;es therefore to re&s;erve him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent, and to watch whether any thing &s;olid can come from &s;o ludicrous and frothy a writer;
<PB N="11" REF="010857_0006_0F8524CF1C96A250">and as to the other matters, he is perfectly indifferent. He is &s;o intirely void of &s;pleen, and ill-nature, and prejudice again&s;t this writer, that he is ready to confe&s;s the nimble turns and motions of his pen, and can laugh as heartily at any monkey-tricks he can exhibit for the amu&s;ement of his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects, as any other per&s;on. In the mean while, if any one who is not under the&s;e re&s;traints, &s;hall incline to divert him&s;elf with, or to endea|vour to bring to order, this Hu&s;&s;ar in controver&s;y, who will con|fine him&s;elf to no rules, but as the whim takes him will fly from front to rear, and from flank to center, he has my con&s;ent.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly. I object again&s;t immediately engaging with the <HI>American Whig,</HI> becau&s;e it is yet uncertain whether he will produce any thing worthy of notice, and becau&s;e I think it advi&s;eable to &s;ee the amount of his whole performances that I may have it in my power to choo&s;e for my&s;elf in what manner to deal with him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4thly. Another objection ari&s;es from the &s;trange aver&s;ion I have to a repetition of the &s;ame things. Now it happens, that among others, a gentleman of character in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> has undertaken a con|futation of the haple&s;s <HI>Appeal;</HI> and he is entitled, both from his known reputation, and his open and manly method of advancing, to particular re&s;pect. I know of no one, at pre&s;ent, that bids as fair to be the object of my principal attention as this gentleman; as to tho&s;e anonymous writers who &s;hall plea&s;e to favour me with their animadver&s;ions on my pamphlet, they will not take it ami&s;s, if I con&s;ider them as belonging to an inferior cla&s;s. They mu&s;t be contented, &s;o far as their arguments &s;hall corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of Dr. <HI>C&mdash;y,</HI> to take their places in his train, and hear what I have to &s;ay to <HI>him;</HI> but in any ca&s;es wherein <HI>they</HI> &s;hall be thought to de&s;erve &s;pecial notice, they &s;hall have it occa&s;ionally.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Having thus declared my intention to do ju&s;tice to all men, I will mention the manner in which it will probably be di&s;tributed. In the fir&s;t place I &s;hall be careful to di&s;tingui&s;h rea&s;oning from railing, from empty harrangue, from the flouri&s;hes of wit, and from all other heterogenious mixtures. The rea&s;oning I will keep for my own u&s;e, and leave all the re&s;t untouched for the original proprietors, in order, that when opportunity offers, they may be|&s;tow it more properly. I will then make a farther di&s;tinction, and mark out tho&s;e rea&s;ons that are immediately to the purpo&s;e, &s;epa|rating them from tho&s;e that are but remotely &s;o, and from others that &s;hall have been totally mi&s;applied. To tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, and &s;econd cla&s;&s;es, I will endeavour to give proper and di&s;tinct an|&s;wers; as to tho&s;e of the third cla&s;s, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew their impertinence.</P>
<P>In this way I hope I &s;hall be able to &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth, and to remove prejudices and errors; and, to whi&s;per a &s;ecret into the ears of the Public, I do not de&s;pair, that even our <HI>American
<PB N="12" REF="010857_0007_0F8524D44D3E78F0">Whig,</HI> with all his bri&s;kne&s;s and volatility, will be pro&s;elyted to the &s;ober doctrine of the Appeal. For I think his oppo&s;ition can|not be of long continuance, after the hone&s;t conce&s;&s;ion he has made towards the clo&s;e of his paper. <Q>'Tis true, &s;ays he, the pam|phlet is &s;pecious, and appears to a&s;k nothing but what is highly rea&s;onable; and could any man, above the capacity of an Ideot, really per&s;uade him&s;elf, that the Doctor and the Convention would content them&s;elves with a Bi&s;hop, &s;o limited and cur|tailed as he is plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent his future Lord&s;hip; it were manife&s;t inju&s;tice to deny them what in their opinion their eter|nal &s;alvation &s;o greatly depends upon.</Q> So that nothing ap|pears to be now wanting to his conver&s;ion, but to convince him that the Doctor and the Convention would content them&s;elves with &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are de&s;cribed in the <HI>Appeal.</HI> Now this is as really and certainly true, as that he him&s;elf is a <HI>Whig;</HI> and un|le&s;s he is ob&s;tinately re&s;olved to be deaf and blind to all proper evidence, it can be clearly proved to him.</P>
<P>By way of conclu&s;ion, the author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> begs leave to a&s;&s;ure the Public, that notwith&s;tanding the charge brought again&s;t him by the <HI>American Whig,</HI> he neither knows, nor believes, nor &s;u&s;pects, that he has mi&s;repre&s;ented a &s;ingle fact, and to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf,</P>

I do moreover affirm and declare, that this a&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> is ab&s;olutely, utterly and intirely fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. And
<PB N="13" REF="010857_0007_0F8524D44D3E78F0">I hereby call upon him in this open manner, both as a member of, and as Secretary to the Convention, publickly to pruduce the au|thorities upon which he has a&s;&s;erted &s;o infamous a fal&s;hood.

<P>DR. CHANDLER'S <HI>Appeal to the Public in behalf of the Church of England in America,</HI> which from his own account, &s;eems rather to be <HI>the united effort of all the</HI> CLERCY <HI>in New-York and New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> perfected by the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>the</HI> CLERGY <HI>from the neighbouring provinces,</HI> may by this time be &s;uppo&s;ed to have circulated pretty generally. And as the &s;ea&s;on advances, when we pre&s;ume the&s;e CLERGY are again to meet in voluntary Convention, this may be the proper time to propo&s;e a few que&s;ti|ons for <HI>their</HI> or if the Dr. plea&s;es for <HI>his con&s;ideration.</HI> The per|formance &s;eems replete with bold extravagant a&s;&s;ertions of facts, many of which have no foundation in truth; it is greatly deficient in Chri&s;tian Charity, tho' not deficient in low craft, and &s;eems dangerous to the civil and religious Liberties of the Colonies in America. But I perceive that if any objections be made to his Plan, our new Doctor from a per&s;ua&s;ion already formed, is pre|pared to a&s;cribe them, rather to <HI>"the dexterity and ill will of the inventors than" to "the real fears and unea&s;ine&s;s of the inha|bitants."</HI> (P. 112) Nay he is &s;o bold, as to a&s;&s;ert that <Q><HI>every op|po&s;ition to &s;uch plan</HI></Q> as he has propo&s;ed, <Q><HI>has the nature of per&s;ecution and de&s;erves the name.</HI></Q> (82) Again he &s;ays, <HI>"if
<PB N="14" REF="010857_0008_0F8524D466FFA480">no objections &s;hall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all parties acquie&s;ce and are &s;atisfied."</HI> (2) Thus on the one hand, &s;ilence is to be con&s;trued into a&s;&s;ent and approbation, and on the other hand, if we object to, or oppo&s;e his plan, we are to be &s;tig|matized as per&s;ecutors and the wor&s;t of mankind. However as he &s;eems to admit a po&s;&s;ibility that &s;ome <HI>"objections may continue, which may be thought to de&s;erve notice"</HI> and is plea&s;ed to erect an imaginary tribunal, and to invite the objectors <HI>"to propo&s;e them that they may be debated before that tribunal,"</HI> it &s;eems hard to oblige tho&s;e, who cannot altogether approve his plan, to yield the cau&s;e untried, or to bear the names of <HI>"malicious, "intolerant, "per&s;ecutors, "enemies to all religion "and the church, "hot "headed writers, "pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;ts," &amp;c.</HI> nay even to have their loyalty called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s there are &s;ome objections to this plan, that "con|tinue" with me, and which, to as many as I have mentioned them, &s;eem to "de&s;erve notice" but before I propo&s;e them to be debated before the "tribunal of the public," I &s;hould be glad the Doctor would deign to explain &s;ome of his terms, and give us farther in|formation on &s;ome points, that I &s;hall propo&s;e.</P>
<P>He begins with informing us "that application has been made to our SUPERIORS, by the <HI>Clergy of &s;everal of the Colonies,</HI> reque&s;t|ing one or more Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America;" he complains of "unprecedented hard&s;hips," and "intolerable grievances," &s;uf|fered by the "Church" the "American Church" the "Church of England in America" for want of "an American Epi&s;copate" and upon this &s;ounds his Appeal to the Public.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be obliged to the Doctor, if he would inform us in plain terms, who are the&s;e <HI>&s;uperiors</HI> to whom the <HI>Clergy</HI> have ap|plied; by whom the&s;e Bi&s;hops are to be &s;ent; by what authority this American Epi&s;copate is to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; or who are the au|thors of the&s;e <HI>intolerable grievances</HI> and <HI>unprecedented hard&s;hips?</HI> that we may the better judge, whether the apprehen&s;ions on ac|count of our civil Liberties, which this avowed application has rai&s;ed in the minds of many people, be well or ill founded. As he has appealed to the public, would it not be proper for him to inform us, again&s;t whom he appeals? Whether again&s;t the King his Mini&s;ters and the Briti&s;h Parliament, for not redre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e grievances, of which he complains, and for not e&s;tabli&s;hing Epi&s;|copacy in America, as he &s;eems to think they ought to have done? Or whether the Appeal is made again&s;t tho&s;e, who, thro' fear of an inva&s;ion and infringement of their civil and religious Liberties, think it their duty to oppo&s;e &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment? If again&s;t the former, the court mu&s;t indeed be augu&s;t and re&s;pectable, which he has con&s;tituted to take cognizance of our Sovereign and the Briti&s;h Parliament. If again&s;t the latter, as by the rules of all
<PB N="15" REF="010857_0008_0F8524D466FFA480">well e&s;tabli&s;hed courts, both plainti&s;&s;s and defendants are excluded from judging in their own cau&s;e, I fancy there will be few in Ame|rica to &s;it in judgment. For let the Doctor flatter as much as he plea&s;es, if ever the attempt be made, he will find that the preju|dices and objections of mo&s;t of our Colonies are too deeply rooted and too well founded, for them ever to &s;ubmit quietly to an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, e&s;tabli&s;hed over them even by act of Parliament; this would be to de&s;troy their charters, laws, and their very con|&s;titutions; and it will be well if the Doctor and his a&s;&s;ociates are not con&s;idered as abettors of Mr. Greenville and tho&s;e Enemies of America, who are exerting their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;trip us of our mo&s;t &s;acred, invaluable and inherent Rights; to reduce us to the &s;tate of &s;laves; and to tax us by laws, to which we never have a&s;&s;ented, nor can a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We would al&s;o a&s;k the Doctor, why is the application made for a Bi&s;hop at this particular time when the liberties of America are at &s;take? Why are &s;ome in&s;inuations of di&s;loyalty thrown out again&s;t his American Brethren? For what are the tendency of his political rea&s;ons, but to inflame the jealou&s;y of the people of Great-Britain? Can there be no Bi&s;hops without e&s;tabli&s;hments; no or|dination without act of Parliament? Mu&s;t this be a new and a primitive, or a part of the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>The claims of the Doctor, without an e&s;tabli&s;hment, notwith|&s;tanding all his &s;eeming mode&s;ty and candour, are too great, not to awaken jealou&s;ies in the minds of free born Americans, if none had been conceived there before.</P>
<P>The "Church" the American Church, "the Church of Eng|land in America," are the names by which he affects to di&s;tingui&s;h that denomination of Chri&s;tans, to which he belongs. I wi&s;h the Doctor would plea&s;e to define his terms, and tell us what he means by Church, and why that name &s;hould be applied to Engli&s;h Epi&s;copalians only. Are not the Lutheran and Calvini&s;t Churches, are not the Congregational, Con&s;ociated and Pre&s;byterian Churches; are not the Bapti&s;t, the Quaker and all other Churches in America, of what denomination &s;oever they be, members of Chri&s;t's Catholic Church, if they profe&s;s faith in Chri&s;t and hold the great e&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity? Or does he mean to lay &s;uch a &s;tre&s;s on unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and on Epi&s;copacy as by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in England, as to make the&s;e e&s;&s;ential to the being of a Church? His words indeed &s;eem to import as much, where he &s;ays, <HI>"Men may ridicule the notion of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as they plea&s;e"</HI> but <HI>"if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion be once broken and the powers of ordination once lo&s;t, not all the men on earth, not all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, can re&s;tore it. It is as great an ab&s;urdity for a man to preach without being pro|perly &s;ent, as it is to hear without a preacher, or to believe in him
<PB N="16" REF="010857_0009_0F8524D62CE25758">of whom they have never heard."</HI> This may be the Doctor's pri|vate opinion borrowed from the No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">jurors and other di&s;turbers of the Church and State during the reigns of King William, Queen Ann and King George the fir&s;t, but &s;urely it is not the doctrine of the Church of England: it has long &s;ince been di&s;claimed by &s;ome of its greate&s;t Doctors and able&s;t Divines. However, I &s;hould be glad the Doctor would explain him&s;elf further, and try to reconcile the&s;e high notions with Chri&s;tian Charity, and with the validity of ordination in the foreign prote&s;tant Churches, or of tho&s;e who make no pretence to an unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The candour of his &s;entiments and (if we may believe him) of the doc|trine and belief of the Church of England, with regard to the go|vernment of tho&s;e Churches in America, which are not Epi&s;copal, is worthy of notice. "<HI>If,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>according to the doctrine and belief of the Church of England, none have a right to govern the Church but Bi&s;hops, then the American Church mu&s;t be without government.</HI> (27) But le&s;t we may have mi&s;under&s;tood him, we de&s;ire he may tell us, whether he means that the Epi&s;copal Chri&s;|tians are the only Church in America, and con&s;equently excludes all other Churches who want Bi&s;hops, from being members of the American Church; or whether he would a&s;&s;ert that all others are without order and government for want of Bi&s;hops, and therefore unde&s;erving the name of Churches.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Church of England in America,"</HI> which he often repeats, is a new expre&s;&s;ion, unwarranted by &s;cripture, not known in law, and hardly intelligible in language, and therefore wants explana|tion. We read in &s;cripture of the Church of Antioch, of Corinth, and of Rome; and of the Churches in A&s;ia and Judea; but we no where read of the Church of Jeru&s;alem in Rome, or of the Church of Judea in Europe or A&s;ia; in like manner, we hear of the Church of England, the Church of Ireland, and the Church of Scotland; but the Church of England in America is a new mode of expre&s;&s;ion: Yet by this new fangled term, the Doctor and other Mi&s;&s;ionaries affect to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves and their follow|ers, while with an air of arrogance and &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, they call other denominations of Chri&s;tians, Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>We apprehend this is not a meer impropriety of &s;peech adopted by a man who &s;eems not to be one of the mo&s;t correct writers, but a phra&s;e artfully introduced with a &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Doctor cannot have read &s;o little either of civil or eccle&s;i|a&s;tical hi&s;tory, or be &s;o very little acquainted with mankind as not to know the magic of words, and the blind devotion paid to names and &s;ounds. The words <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> carry great re|verence with them in &s;ome countries, and terrible confu&s;ions and animo&s;ities have been rai&s;ed in other countries by the words <HI>Church, Clergy, divine right, uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, indelible character,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="010857_0009_0F8524D62CE25758">and &s;uch like undefined non&s;en&s;e; we hope the like game will ne|ver be played in America.</P>
<P>The <HI>"national religion"</HI> is another phra&s;e of the Doctor's, wherewith he gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e peculiar tenets of his Church; with what view he u&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may ea&s;ily gue&s;s from the privileges he has annexed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the doctrine he teaches and confirms with an <HI>"indeed"</HI> concerning it. Tho&s;e, &s;ays he, "who di&s;&s;ent from the <HI>National Religion,</HI> have, <HI>indeed,</HI> no natural right to any degree of civil or military power." (109) As the Doctor in ano|ther place declares, that "nothing has been a&s;&s;erted in the cour&s;e of his work, but what the author believes, upon good evidence, to be true." We hope he will produce his evidence to prove this doctrine, which &s;ounds &s;trange in an American ear. In the mean time, we would a&s;k him, why might not Chri&s;tianity have been allowed the honour of being called the national reli|gion? Or why is Epi&s;copacy alone honoured with that name? Is it becau&s;e it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in England? Is not Pre&s;bytery al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed by law? And was it not e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1707, a more enlightnened age &s;urely than that in which Epi&s;copacy was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the reformation? If the one is a national church, becau&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, why not the other, becau&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland? But what is this to us in America? Becau&s;e the&s;e forms are e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great-Britain, mu&s;t they al&s;o be e&s;tabli&s;hed here? Many thou&s;ands fled to the wilds of America from Epi&s;copal tyranny and per&s;ecution, and to enjoy the free exerci&s;e of religion in a way mo&s;t agreeable to their con&s;cien|ces, (and as they conceived) to &s;cripture and rea&s;on; e&s;tabli&s;hed colonies, formed governments, framed laws and founded Church|es; and mu&s;t all the&s;e be termed di&s;&s;enters, becau&s;e the doctor and they differ? Or have they "no natural right to any degree of civil and military power," becau&s;e they are not of the nation|al religion. That is, if we believe the Doctor, the religion which he, and "<HI>the Clergy of the &s;everal colonies</HI> (meaning the mi&s;&s;ionaries) <HI>profe&s;s?</HI>"</P>
<P>It is not doubted but every man who wi&s;hes to be free will, by all lawful ways in his power, oppo&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any one denomination in America, the preventing which is the only means of &s;ecuring their natural rights, to all tho&s;e at lea&s;t who may dif|fer from that denomination. The Doctor &s;eems &s;en&s;ible that the oppo&s;ition to the&s;e lordly prelates, will not wholly re&s;t with tho&s;e whom <HI>he</HI> terms Di&s;&s;enters, that their encroachments in civil matters are di&s;agreeable to very many who admit their authority in the Church; he therefore &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>"the Bi&s;h|ops"</HI> he de&s;ires, "&s;hall not interfere with the property or privi|leges, whether civil or religious of <HI>Churchmen</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>"&mdash; "that they &s;hall only ordain and govern the Clergy, and admi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="18" REF="010857_0010_0F8524D69E8FAF48">confirmation to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it." But when he comes to explain him&s;elf farther, he cautiou&s;ly inter&s;per&s;es the words, <HI>at "pre&s;ent," now,"</HI> and &s;uch qualifying expre&s;&s;ions as leave the Bi&s;hops when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, a full liberty to revive every claim and privilege they have ever made or enjoyed. Even with regard to Tithes (105) while he is obviating objections that might be rai&s;ed on account of them, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with &s;uch cautions ambiguity, as to leave it doubtful whether he does not mean that a Bi&s;hop e&s;tabli&s;hed in America may claim and re|cover them by the laws of England. Nay &s;uch Ideas of Gran|deur and Magnificence has the Doctor united with the word <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> that while he is pleading for &s;uch as he calls primitive Bi&s;hops, he hints at lordly revenues; he lets us know a committee was extra|ordinarily appointed to find out ways and means for the main|tenance and &s;upport of Bi&s;hops in America; (49) that a fund has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for that particular purpo&s;e for more than half a century pa&s;t;" that many thou&s;and pounds have been contributed to increa&s;e this fund. (108) But, "if this &s;tock is not &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a proper Epi&s;copate in America," <HI>"&s;hould a general tax be laid on the country and thereby a &s;um rai&s;ed &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e" "this would be no mighty hard&s;hip on the coun|try;"</HI> and he who would think much of paying it, <HI>de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the light of a good &s;ubject.</HI>" (107) That here|after they may be inve&s;ted with &s;ome degree of civil power worthy their acceptance. (110) In &s;hort, hints, that legi&s;lative and execu|tive powers may both be placed in their hands, (ibidem) And with all the&s;e princely revenues, with all this acce&s;&s;ion of power, what are they to do? Only to ordain and govern the Clergy? No: They are <HI>"to defend and protect both the Clergy and Laity."</HI> The&s;e things are &s;o unlike the appearance of a primitive Bi&s;hop, that we mu&s;t &s;ay, that though "at pre&s;ent" we hear the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e of Jacob, we &s;ee and may "hereafter feel the rough and hairy hands of <HI>E&s;au.</HI></P>
<P>One thing more I would beg to know from the Doctor; what a&s;&s;urances (be&s;ides his own, which are too weak to be relied on in &s;o momentous an affair) are we to have that Bi&s;hops will be &s;ent over with &s;uch limited powers? attempts are made upon Ameri|can liberty from a quarter where it ought not to be expected. A temper is &s;hewn by &s;ome leading prelates even now in England, that will not &s;uffer us to place a confidence in them. One of them at the head of the &s;ociety for propogating the go&s;pel was not a&s;hamed to oppo&s;e a plan for the conver&s;ion of the Indians, be|cau&s;e concerted by a denomination of Chri&s;tians who "followed not with him." Another of them lately attended the board of trade to prevent the grant of a charter to the Pre&s;byterian Church in New-York.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010857_0010_0F8524D69E8FAF48">
But &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Bi&s;hops &s;ent over with the&s;e limitted powers, is there any probability they will be content with them? can we &s;uppo&s;e that the Clergy of a Society, which thinks it&s;elf peculi|arly entitled to national favour, and a&s;&s;erts it&s;elf to be &s;o e&s;&s;enti|ally connected with the &s;tate, will, if once e&s;tabli&s;hed ever give ea&s;e or peace to other Churches in America, whom they now treat as Di&s;&s;enters, until they have a plenary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every privilege enjoyed by the Church in England by law e&s;tabli&s;hed? With Bi&s;hops at their head, will not the cry be as loud, if they have not eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, for di&s;cipline and to harra&s;s their neighbours? A Bi&s;hop without a court, is as unparalleled as any hard&s;hip complained of? Again mu&s;t not the <HI>Clergy</HI> have a main|tenance? The &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel is not able to provide for all that may be ordained; the Epi&s;copal congrega|tions cannot maintain them; mu&s;t they then &s;tarve in America? When in England they have a legal right to the tithes? Will not the cry at la&s;t be, nay does not the Doctor almo&s;t make it already, that they alone have a right to all places of power and profit in the colonies as well as in England and Ireland, becau&s;e the mo&s;t friendly to monarchy?</P>
<P>We hope the Doctor will explain him&s;elf fully, and re&s;olve the doubts and queries we have here propo&s;ed. On &s;ome other occa|&s;ion we may enter the li&s;ts and examine his divine right of dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy; his unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: the connection between natural rights, and a national religion; his Doctrine of tithes; the numbers of his denomination and their unparalleled &s;ufferings in America, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the Northern colonies fled from the cruel per&s;ecution of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to this country, which then was an uncultivated wilderne&s;s. The Indians &s;oon became jealous of the new &s;ettlers, and gave them all the di&s;turb|ance in their power. But tho&s;e brave &s;ons of religion and liberty, cho&s;e rather to run the ri&s;que of the rage and malice of the In|dian
<PB N="20" REF="010857_0011_0F8524D75DAFEE08">&s;avages, than of the perfidious and per&s;ecuting bi&s;hops. They continued to &s;ettle the country, and God, in whom they tru&s;ted, appeared for their defence, and drove out the heathens from before them.</P>
<P>As <HI>America</HI> is a new country, and the &s;ettlers generally poor, they are obliged to be very laborious, in order to procure a tole|rable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and families. They have ever been, and &s;till are, too much engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, to get ac|quainted with the parties and controver&s;ies that continued in the mother-country, and particularly in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> e&s;pecially as they hoped, that their great enemies the dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, would be contented, &s;ince they had in effect procured them to be bani&s;hed from the land of their nativity. Indeed, we could not but hope, they would have &s;uffered us to live in peace in the&s;e remote parts of the earth; and that the va&s;t Atlan|tic ocean would have &s;erved for a partition between us to all ge|nerations. But &s;ince it appears, that their &s;piritual lord&s;hips are invited to follow us, even into the&s;e di&s;tant corners of the earth, it is become nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider, with &s;ome degree of attention, the parties which compo&s;e the Church of <HI>England.</HI> This is re|qui&s;ite, to &s;hew what little regard is to be paid to tho&s;e ignorant zealots, who a&s;&s;ert that there are no parties among them, in order that due ju&s;tice may be done to their re&s;pective characters; and that it may be clearly known who are the per&s;ons we intend to cen&s;ure. For as there are many worthy men belonging to that communion, equally expo&s;ed with the wi&s;e and virtuous of every other denomination to the pe&s;tilent project in embryo, I mean the de&s;ign of importing a cargo of Bi&s;hops, it is not our inten|tion to give them any offence.</P>
<P>The reformation was begun in <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, and that from no very religious motive. Since the Pope refu&s;ed to grant him liberty to marry, he a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the &s;ame &s;u|premacy in <HI>England,</HI> which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> had u&s;urped over the Church and con&s;ciences of men. And he carried this power &s;o exceeding high, that his &s;ubjects were forced to comply with his injunctions, or be ruined. The con&s;equence was, that while a few embraced the reformation out of con&s;cience, multitudes &s;ubmitted merely to &s;ave their e&s;tates, and avoid per&s;ecution. Hence, when Queen <HI>Mary</HI> commanded them to return to popery, they very generally complied. Nor is there any rea&s;on to think they were, for the mo&s;t part, more &s;incere in their re-conver&s;ion to prote&s;tanti&s;m, at the command of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> And thus the national Church of <HI>England</HI> was erected; &s;uch were the greater part of her clergy and laity.</P>
<P>This clearly &s;hews us the origin of two famous parties, viz. <HI>High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church,</HI> as they are termed in <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="010857_0011_0F8524D75DAFEE08">From the beginning of the reformation, it being effected &s;o much by force, many who were really papi&s;ts in their hearts, yielded to the times, and conformed out of &s;elf-intere&s;t. Such were al|ways &s;trongly inclined to prevent every farther &s;tep of reforma|tion; and cho&s;e rather again, to coale&s;ce with the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Such were always mighty &s;ticklers for pomp in religious wor&s;hip; for rites and ceremonies, and the uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: And &s;uch, in a word, have always been the ringlead|ers in per&s;ecuting all, who, from a principle of religion and con&s;cience, could not adopt their mea&s;ures. For having them&s;elves no idea about tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, they would make no allowance for others. When the hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart</HI> was called to the throne of <HI>England,</HI> and proved, as is well known by woful experience, a weak and tyrannical race of princes, who meditated utterly to de&s;troy the liberties of the nation; the high Churchmen joined heartily with them, and endeavoured to &s;up|port all their mea&s;ures. The Bi&s;hops and Clergy intoxicated tho&s;e monarchs with the mo&s;t ful&s;ome flattery, a&s;&s;uring them, that as vicegerents of God, they were not accountable to men, and that &s;ubjects mu&s;t obey on pain of damnation: The kings in return promoted tho&s;e &s;ycophants to great riches and dignity, and permitted them to gratify their cruel and popi&s;h &s;pirit, by per&s;ecuting their fellow prote&s;tants. And thus they continued to ravage and de|&s;troy the nation, till God, in his merciful providence, put an end to their tyranny, by King <HI>William</HI> the IIId. of glorious me|mory. But have they been quiet and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ince the happy revolution? No, they greatly di&s;turbed the peace and comfort of that excellent prince, by many plots and con&s;piracies: And they had accompli&s;hed the extirpation of the national liberty in the reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> had not the Almighty graciou&s;ly inter|fered, and again bla&s;ted their execrable de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s party rai&s;ed rebellions in the reigns of <HI>George</HI> the fir&s;t and &s;econd, and involved the nation in blood and &s;laugh|ter.&mdash;And who are now &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;irous of having Bi&s;hops introduced into the colonies, to lord it over them? Who indeed but the High Churchmen? Many of the American Mi&s;&s;ion|aries are High Churchmen; &s;ince they cannot on any other con|&s;i&s;tent plan, ju&s;tify their conduct in gathering Pro&s;elytes from other communions. They are the true, if not the only, de&s;cen|dants and approvers of Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s principles and mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>The other party is that which is commonly known by the name of <HI>Low Churchmen,</HI> and may be thus characterized. They em|braced the reformation from con&s;cience, and have always been di&s;po&s;ed to carry it farther; lamenting the many unhappy defici|encies
<PB N="22" REF="010857_0012_0F8524D8317CF9D0">of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> the relicks of popery; and the &s;uper&s;titious rites and ceremonies &s;till retained. They have ever been favourable to the prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; and firmly attached to the civil liberties of their country; to the <HI>revolution,</HI> and the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> but avowed enemies to popery &s;la|very, and arbitrary power. The&s;e do not de&s;ire to impo&s;e dioce|&s;an Bi&s;hops to undermine our rights and privileges. Nor do the <HI>Low Churchmen in the colonies,</HI> wi&s;h for the re&s;idence of tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tic Lords among&s;t us. With this part, which is the wor|thy part of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> we have no controver&s;y. They are generally men of amiable characters; and heartily con|curred in every lawful and decent mea&s;ure, in oppo&s;ing the late &s;tamp-act. They are &s;incere friends to their country; and pity it is, that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries do not learn moderation and candour from them; nor pay more regard to their advice and example. Then &s;hould we not be perpetually &s;tunned with <HI>the Church is in danger, the Church is in danger;</HI> nor with the great importance and nece&s;&s;ity of rites and ceremonies; nor the introduction of Bi&s;hops into the American plantations.&mdash;Whenever therefore, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, I &s;hall &s;ay any thing re&s;pecting the Epi&s;copal Clergy or laity, that appears har&s;h or invidious, I would always be under&s;tood as aiming at the <HI>High Church</HI> party, the re&s;tle&s;s and implacable enemies of our liberty civil and &s;acred.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t paper I took notice of &s;ome of the favourite cant words in Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s Appeal, &amp;c. which he has u&s;ed to amu&s;e and impo&s;e on the public; the common practi&s;e of de&s;ign|ing men, who want to rai&s;e di&s;turbances in Church or &s;tate. Such kind of words they u&s;ually throw out to catch the unwary; the more undefined and the le&s;s under&s;tood, &s;o much the better. <HI>Great</HI> is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians, was the watch-word given, when Demetrius and his fellow-cra&s;t&s;men threw the whole city of Ephe&s;us into an uproar. Dr. Demetrius hone&s;tly told his fellow-trade&s;men, that by the preaching of St Paul their then Cra&s;t, and con&s;equently their wealth, was in danger. Whatever weight this argument might have with them, he knew it would not have the &s;ame with the populace; therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to tell them that the temple of the great Godde&s;s Diana and her image, were
<PB N="23" REF="010857_0012_0F8524D8317CF9D0">in danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed. This was &s;ufficient to alarm the people and to rai&s;e their &s;pirits and inflame their pa&s;&s;ions, the cry was put into their mouths; great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians, High-Church forever. It requires but very little reading to know how often and how &s;ucce&s;sfully the &s;ame art has been practi&s;ed &s;ince. The <HI>Church,</HI> the Church is in danger, was a notable cry, at a never-to-be-forgotten period of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, when the very per&s;ons who rai&s;ed it and kept it up, were labouring to introduce Popery, the pretender, and arbitrary power; and had not God in his providence bla&s;ted their wicked de&s;igns, and opened the way for the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent royal family, before they had brought their &s;chemes to bear, the con&s;equences might have been ruinous to the nation.</P>
<P>The people had been taught from their infancy to revere the Church without knowing what is meant; they were told by their &s;piritual Guides that it was in danger, without being informed from whence the danger aro&s;e. Thus their fears were awakened, their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed and directed again&s;t the friends of liberty, religion, and their country. In &s;hort &s;uch men as Tillot&s;on, Tenni&s;&s;on, Hoadly, Burnet, the &s;hining Lights and greate&s;t or|naments of their own Church, were vilely mi&s;repre&s;ented as betrayers of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee in what manner Dr. Chandler endeavours to rai&s;e a clamour in America. throughout his whole appeal, he takes it for granted that the Epi&s;copalians are the <HI>American Church,</HI> and that his a&s;&s;ociates the mi&s;&s;ionaries are the <HI>Clergy:</HI> all other denominations of Chri&s;tians be treats as Di&s;&s;enters, Schi&s;matics, and Sectaries; and to their pa&s;tors and public teachers he hardly deigns to allow the name of mini&s;ters; <HI>their Or|dination,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>is at lea&s;t irregular and defective,</HI> but in his judg|ment null and void, and of con&s;equence they are no mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; for &s;ays he, it is as great an ab&s;urdity to preach without being <HI>properly</HI> &s;ent, as to believe in him of whom they have never heard&mdash;The cry is then rai&s;ed the American Church is in Dan|ger, its &s;ufferings are unparalleled, it is peri&s;hing for want of com|mon nece&s;&s;aries, (99) its oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;uch as to de&s;erve the com|pa&s;&s;ion of the whole Chri&s;tian world, (114) "it is ready to expire, and nothing but its ruin is fore&s;een, unle&s;s Bi&s;hops be &s;ent &s;pee|dily" (113)</P>
<P>The <HI>Clergy,</HI> a word of deep import, and u&s;ed to purpo&s;e in &s;ounding the trumpet of &s;edition; the Clergy of &s;everal colonies have taken the alarm, and applied to our <Q>Superiors for aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this dangerous Cri&s;is:</Q> Who the&s;e <HI>Superiors</HI> are, he does not tell us, but doubtle&s;s they are the &s;ame on whom he calls for an e&s;tabli&s;hment of Epi&s;copacy, namely the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation</HI> (87) <HI>and the Guardians of its Intere&s;ts,</HI> (114) tho&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="010857_0013_0F8524D901571FD8">who are <HI>entru&s;ted with the Intere&s;ts of the Nation,</HI> &amp;c. (113) in &s;hort, notwith&s;tanding the Doctor's &s;tudied ambiguity, this appli|cation mu&s;t be ultimately intended for the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And to rou&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of the Briti&s;h Nation, and inflame their Jealou&s;ly, already too much rai&s;ed by the enemies of America, he &s;trongly in&s;inuates, that the &s;tate is not &s;afe un|le&s;s Epi&s;copacy be e&s;tabli&s;hed in America; and attempts to rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions of di&s;loyalty again&s;t all other denominations of Chri&s;ti|ans. <Q><HI>No Trumpet of &s;edition,</HI> &s;ays he, was ever heard to &s;ound from our <HI>Pulpits;</HI> no &s;eeds of di&s;affection have been &s;uf|fered more privately to be &s;own in our hou&s;es.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">For fear this &s;hould not be applied, the Doctor adds a cu|rious Note in the following Words; "This Accu&s;ation is not intended <Q>to imply any accu&s;ation of others; who are able, <HI>'tis hoped,</HI> to make their own <HI>Defence,</HI> whenever the Occa&s;ion &s;hall require it.

But as if this was not &s;ufficient to alarm the fears of the nation, the Doc|tor endeavours to per&s;uade, that his Church is the Church of Eng|land by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, that they are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame; that both mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t or peri&s;h by the &s;ame means; and that therefore unle&s;s Epi&s;copacy is e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, the Church in the mother country will be ruined; (113) and to confound the Ideas in the minds of the populace, the term <HI>Church of England in America</HI> is u&s;ed, ju&s;t as the favourers of popery u&s;e the phra&s;e Church of Rome in England, in Ireland and in France, to give a colour and lay a foundation for the claims and u&s;urpations of the pope in tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="010857_0013_0F8524D901571FD8">
Let us now enquire who are the Cergy of the &s;everal colonies, who have made this application. I believe that no man will &s;u&s;|pect that the mini&s;ters of either the Bapti&s;t, Congregational, Con&s;o|ciated, Calvini&s;t, Lutheran, Pre&s;byterian, or Quaker congrega|tions are concerned in &s;uch an application: and if I am well in|formed (and I believe I am) not one of the Clergy of any deno|mination to the Southward of Penn&s;ylvania had any hand in it. The mi&s;&s;ionaries only therefore &s;eem to be the Doctor's Clergy. Though their knowledge of the civil rights of mankind, and pro|found erudition may not be di&s;puted, yet their rank in life at pre|&s;ent is not very high; for this rea&s;on probably the Doctor thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to give &s;ome weight and importance to the application, to dignify them with the title of the "Clergy, of the &s;everal colonies." By acts like the&s;e, men of low original have been exalted into high &s;tations, and thereby enabled to di&s;tre&s;s per&s;ons more worthy than them&s;elves; thus the Cardinals ro&s;e to the high rank they now hold in the Church of Rome.</P>
<P>As the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries a&s;&s;ume of late an air of importance, I may be indulged while I endeavour to explain their ri&s;e and the nature of their mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our Forefathers harra&s;&s;ed by &s;piritual Courts and the <HI>Power</HI> of the lordly prelates (which in oppo&s;ition to the Doctor I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, and if he plea&s;es will undertake to prove, has always been <HI>&s;trained too high,</HI> when the times would admit) being likewi&s;e denied the privilege of peaceably wor&s;hipping God in a way the mo&s;t agreeable to their con&s;ciences, at la&s;t wearied out with per&s;ecution, re&s;olved to leave their native country, and &s;eek &s;helter in the wilds of America. The power of the Church of England by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, they imagined was confined to England; and for this opinion they had rea&s;on, and the authority of &s;ome of the greate&s;t lawyers; having therefore cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, they thought them&s;elves &s;ecure from the oppre&s;&s;ive tyranny of any proud Ecce&s;ia&s;ticks.</P>
<P>What hard&s;hips they endured in forming their &s;ettlements, are not to be de&s;cribed, hardly to be conceived! However amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es their &s;pirits were &s;upported with the enjoyment of their civil and religious liberties, and the hopes of tran&s;mit|ting them to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the country &s;ettled, towns built and pro&s;pects of peace and plenty opening to their view, than tho&s;e prelates from who&s;e power and per&s;ecution they had fled, began to envy them their liberty, and to lay plans and concert mea&s;ures to bring them again under the yoke of bondage. To prepare the way, a &s;ociety is formed under the &s;pecious pretence of propagating Chri&s;tianity in foreign parts; a fund is e&s;tabli&s;hed for defraying the expences, and pious well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons are de&s;ired to con|tribute to this fund.</P>

For every propo&s;al, there may be a&s;&s;igned a <HI>&s;pecious</HI> rea&s;on and a <HI>true</HI> rea&s;on; the &s;pecious rea&s;on here alledged was the con|ver&s;ion of the Indians in America; this being cried up, capti|vated many and procured large donations from people of all de|nominations. The true but latent rea&s;on, as it &s;eems, was to prepare the way for Epi&s;copal dominion; hence it came to pa&s;s that tho' many mi&s;&s;ionaries were &s;ent to America, with &s;alaries paid them out of the money &s;ub&s;cribed for converting heathens to Chri&s;tianity, not more than two or three (ju&s;t enough to talk of and keep up the pretence) were ever &s;et among the Indians, the re&s;t were chiefly employed in New-England, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania, and &s;ettled in the cities and larger towns and villages, in which the regular public wor&s;hip of God had been long before duly kept up and a mini&s;try maintained.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The candid Doctor Bray, the Bi&s;hop of London's Commi&s;&s;ary in Maryland, ju&s;t before the Incorporation of the Society (who our Doctor calls the Father of the Society) after having taken great Pains to inform him&s;elf, &s;ays "that from New-York North|ward, be found very little Need of Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and in the Colonies of Connecticut and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, <HI>none at all&mdash;</HI> And yet in <HI>1761</HI> there were <HI>30</HI> Salary Men employed by the Society in New-England, <HI>35</HI> in New-York, New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania, and only <HI>14</HI> in all other Continent and I&s;land Colonies, altho' poor blind Heathen Negroes, make up the Body of the People in mo&s;t of the&s;e la&s;t mentioned.</NOTE> The&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries to magnify their office and &s;hew the &s;ucce&s;s of their mi&s;&s;ion, tran&s;mit regularly to the &s;ociety, journals of their proceedings &s;tuffed with accounts of the conver&s;ion of Quakers, Bapti&s;ts, Pre&s;byterians, &amp;c. not to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> but to Epi&s;co|pacy.

<P>In the latter end of Queen Ann's reign a violent pu&s;h was made to e&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy in America by act of parliament, and to get Bi&s;hops &s;ent over who&s;e power and authority might influence

<HEAD>[From Mr. Parker's New-York Gazette, April 4, 1768.] Remarks on the Title, of <HI>a Whip for the American Whig.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PARKER. <HI>Plea&s;e to in&s;ert the following in your next, and you'll oblige a Friend.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON reading in the New-York Mercury, an adverti&s;ement of a weekly paper to be publi&s;hed, under the title of <HI>A Whip for the American Whig;</HI> I could not help falling into a train of &s;e|rious reflections, on the per&s;ecuting genius that in&s;pires the <HI>high flying Tory-party,</HI> in the Epi&s;copal Church: To this day, inhu|man &s;everity has mark'd their character; and for aught I &s;ee, it is &s;o deeply radicated in their <HI>very</HI> con&s;titution, that they will not cea&s;e to be <HI>&s;avages,</HI> till they cea&s;e to exi&s;t, without pa&s;&s;ing through &s;ome wonderful <HI>metamorpho&s;is.</HI> You are warned of your fate a <HI>whole week</HI> before the &s;cene is opened. Sentence is pa&s;&s;ed, it will certainly be executed. The poor <HI>Whig</HI> mu&s;t undergo the di&s;ci|pline of the <HI>Whip.</HI> This, Sir, is but a prelude of what you may look for; you, are yet to be cha&s;ti&s;ed <HI>only</HI> with <HI>whips;</HI> but de|pend upon it, when the <HI>apo&s;tolical monarchs</HI> are come over, and well e&s;tabli&s;hed in their American dominions, you, and &s;uch as you, will be cha&s;ti&s;ed with <HI>&s;corpions.</HI> But this is not all; the <HI>bellum epi&s;copale,</HI> will doubtle&s;s be declared with every circum|&s;tance of awful pomp; and this exten&s;ive continent may &s;oon be alarmed with the thund'ring &s;ignal, <HI>the &s;word of the lord, and of the Bi&s;hop.</HI> Then, O dreadful! The torrent of epi&s;copal vengeance! Then all who will not be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s as to adore the <HI>mitre</HI> and <HI>&s;urplice,</HI> and dedicate both their con&s;ciences and pur&s;es to his <HI>epi&s;copal Maje&s;ty,</HI> may lay their account with&mdash; With what? With &s;omething, I will not <HI>yet particularly name,</HI> but what one may ea&s;ily di&s;cover, by turning over a Church hi&s;tory or two. This may be the fate of many, unle&s;s indulgent heaven interpo&s;e, by not &s;uffering the <HI>right reverend and holy ty|rants,</HI> to plunge their &s;piritual &s;words in the &s;ouls of their fellow creatures; or, if this is permitted, by determining the &s;ecular powers, not to &s;uffer their <HI>anathemas</HI> to be executed to the ut|mo&s;t limits of their &s;everity. I know what I am &s;aying, Ameri|cans &s;hall feel the truth of what I have now &s;urmi&s;ed, at lea&s;t, in part, if they do not now be&s;tir them&s;elves, and unite as one man,
<PB N="29" REF="010857_0015_0F8524DA8EFC8858">to oppo&s;e the erection of &s;piritual monarchies, with all the hero|i&s;m they would di&s;play in oppo&s;ing a formidable army of <HI>dons</HI> and <HI>mon&s;ieurs.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems the <HI>Whipper</HI> is not of opinion that the almo&s;t unparal|leled hard&s;hips, which the ance&s;tors of many of us &s;uffered, un|der the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ab&s;olute tyranny of the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> lords in the la&s;t cen|tury, do not con&s;titute a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our being alarmed at the pre&s;ent conjuncture. It &s;eems his &s;oul within him is in agony, when he reflects, that <HI>&s;uch of them</HI> as e&s;caped the epi&s;co|pal &s;word, &s;ound an a&s;ylum in the wilds of America, among In|dians and rattle-&s;nakes, more ho&s;pitable to them than Bi&s;hops, and their devoted creatures, the curates; and when he takes a view of <HI>their</HI> po&s;terity peaceably enjoying the repo&s;e that was purcha&s;ed by unexampled indu&s;try and fatigue. It &s;eems I &s;ay, this is the real temper of this epi&s;copal zealot; el&s;e why is he of|fended at us, and threatens us with the <HI>Whip,</HI> when we complain that the <HI>prelatical Clergy</HI> (for I dare &s;ay the people in communion with them, do not de&s;ire the woful day) are ince&s;&s;antly labouring to bring over the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> men of the &s;ame office and &s;tamp, with tho&s;e <HI>blood &s;uckers,</HI> who obliged our ance&s;tors to abandon their native land, and leave behind them what is the very heaven of per&s;ecutors, and tempori&s;ing conformi&s;ts.</P>
<P>I intend to lay before the public, a tragical hi&s;tory of the cru|elty of Briti&s;h Bi&s;hops, &s;ince the reformation which, I am per|&s;uaded will alarm, not only tho&s;e who <HI>are called</HI> di&s;&s;enters, but every per&s;on in communion with the epi&s;copal Church, who is not &s;o hardened as to be un&s;u&s;ceptible of every human and Chri&s;ti|an impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mean while, I cannot help &s;miling at the cringing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>complete</HI> gentleman, who has undertaken the office of a <HI>Whip|per,</HI> a high flying Tory &s;o humbled! One, who no doubt expects to be elevated one day or other, to a deanary, perhaps to the epi&s;copal throne, now brought &s;o low as to &s;tand at a <HI>Whipping-Po&s;t,</HI> and belabour the <HI>po&s;teriors</HI> of a poor <HI>Whig;</HI> I wi&s;h he would take care of the <HI>con&s;equence.</HI> After this, I hope I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure to find every one who is found to be an <HI>acce&s;&s;ary</HI> to the <HI>Whipper,</HI> or who favours his paper, to be laugh'd at in the &s;treets, and in every corner to meet with the &s;alute, your humble &s;ervant Mr. <HI>Whipper.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. IV.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Author of the <HI>American Whig.</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>If you approve of the following &s;entiments, I beg you'll publi&s;h them to prevent Epi&s;copalians in general, from being the &s;ub|jects of undi&s;tingui&s;hing reproach.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH a train of evils have followed the inve&s;titure of the Chri&s;tian clergy with temporal powers and dignities, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a generous mind, to reflect upon the exemption of <HI>America</HI> from the dominion of rich and proud ec|cie&s;ia&s;tics, without exultation and tran&s;port. While the primitive Church was neglected or per&s;ecuted by the princes and nobles of this world, it &s;pread and triumphed; but no &s;ooner was it fo&s;tered and patronized by the great, than it became di&s;tingui&s;hed rather for corruption than piety; and manifold experience has evinced what our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had declared, that his kingdom was &s;o far from being of this world, that true Chri&s;tianity, as tho' it &s;corned all &s;ecular aids, flouri&s;hed be&s;t, when, in&s;tead of the &s;miles, it had the frowns and the contempt of the world. All hi&s;tory is in favour of the&s;e remarks; and therefore, tho' I am not again&s;t Kings becoming nur&s;ing fathers to the Church, yet has &s;he no cau&s;e to thank them for all their flattering endowments, which tend to puff up the pride of her &s;ons: This in&s;tead of nur&s;ing, is poi&s;oning her; and it would be &s;o far from promoting her in|tere&s;t, to make every &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the apo&s;tles, as rich as a lord, (a condition which too many de&s;ire) that I believe the go&s;pel harve&s;t would in &s;uch ca&s;e, find &s;carce a labourer to gather it in.</P>
<P>I was led to the&s;e reflections by the peru&s;al of <HI>Doctor Chand|ler's</HI> lamentations for the want of Bi&s;hops in <HI>America:</HI> This gen|tleman thinks we have greatly &s;uffered, and are expo&s;ed to &s;till great|er hard&s;hips, for the want of this order of Clergymen among&s;t us; I &s;ay <HI>we,</HI> becau&s;e I profe&s;s my&s;elf a Churchman, tho' ut|terly oppo&s;ed to his project; and I hope a difference of &s;entiment upon this &s;ubject, will never be made a te&s;t, whether a man is, or is not, a true &s;on of the Church. If a &s;incere approbation of the wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is &s;ufficient to merit the character, my claim to it is free from excep|tion; and had I my re&s;idence in <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hould not be for|feited for want of an acquie&s;cence in, or indeed, if nece&s;&s;ary, a conte&s;t for the Church, with all the temporal privileges and im|munities confirmed by the law of the land; becau&s;e I am of opini|on, that it would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to innovate
<PB N="31" REF="010857_0016_0F8524DB39981848">with amendments in that country, without expo&s;ing the Church and kingdom to con&s;equences ruinous to both.</P>
<P>But tho' a Churchman, I am an <HI>American Churchman,</HI> a mem|ber of the <HI>American</HI> epi&s;copal Church; for in my judgement there is a real difference between an <HI>American</HI> Church of <HI>Englandman,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, and an <HI>American Epi&s;copalian.</HI> There are ma|ny civil and religious appendages and annexations, the undoubted rights of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which <HI>Epi&s;copa|lians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> cannot, as friends to <HI>this country,</HI> wi&s;h to &s;ee introduced. According to this di&s;tinction, I am in principle op|po&s;ed to tithes, Bi&s;hops, baronies, and a thou&s;and other powers and peculiarities, occa&s;ioned by the liberality of popes and prin|ces, and the &s;uper&s;tition of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Thus far, perhaps, I have given no great umbrage to the author of the <HI>Appeal;</HI> and I believe to but few of the Epi&s;copa|lians of this continent. But I go farther than the <HI>Doctor</HI> and his advocates will perhaps think con&s;i&s;tent with my profe&s;&s;ion as a churchman. And I confe&s;s the oppo&s;ition to an Epi&s;copate in America, gives &s;o much ground for &s;u&s;picion, as to render an a&s;|&s;ignment of a few rea&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate my claim; the&s;e are too many to be crowded into the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle letter, and if they are not better urged by others, will occa&s;ion a continua|tion of our corre&s;pondence. I &s;hall at pre&s;ent confine my&s;elf to one &s;ingle topic, and that is this,</P>
<P><HI>With the Bi&s;hops we &s;hall naturally have the introduction or e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts.</HI></P>
<P>The power of the&s;e judicatories is great and formidable; for the &s;piritual cognizance reaches to perjuries in Church matters, u&s;ury, a&s;&s;aults and batteries of Clergymen, brawlers in Churches, and Church-yards, marriage contracts, alimony, adultery, di|vorces, fornication, drunkenne&s;s, bla&s;phemy, ab&s;ence from Church, with-holding contributions for building Churches, &s;ub&s;tracting legacies, temerary admini&s;tration, or the ob&s;tructing the proof of wills, &s;lander, di&s;turbing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pews or &s;eats, &s;ub&s;trac|tion of marriage portions; fees of judges, regi&s;ters and proctors, and to all other offences prohibited by the canons of the Church.</P>
<P>As a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> I am not aver&s;e to the puni&s;hment of enormi|ties that bring reproach and &s;candal upon our mo&s;t holy religion. As <HI>a Churchman,</HI> I hold, that the power to inflict it, belongs to the Bi&s;hop. As an <HI>Old England Churchman,</HI> I a&s;&s;ert, that the Bi&s;hop's decree does legally expo&s;e the delinquent to civil inconve|niencies: But as an <HI>American Churchman,</HI> I would limit the power of the Church and clergy to a meer excommunication, or denial of the &s;acrament of the Lord's-&s;upper, and give the far|ther puni&s;hment of the offences triable in <HI>England</HI> in the &s;piritual court, to the judges of the court of common law. For no man
<PB N="32" REF="010857_0017_0F8524DBEC7AB418">can in&s;i&s;t, that the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops have authority, <HI>jure divine,</HI> to all that extent of power they at pre&s;ent enjoy. As &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the apo&s;tles, they can claim no right which their predece&s;&s;ors had not; and to me, the &s;uppo&s;ition is utterly incredible, that the Apo&s;tles either exerci&s;ed, or claimed the authority which the Bi&s;hops of the Church of <HI>England</HI> now execute in their &s;piritual courts.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop's title is not derived from the apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion: They are &s;eized by the law of the land, and will hold their pre|heminencies till this law is altered, by king, lords and commons.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> who was no zealous advocate for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, tells us, in his hi&s;tory of the common law, <HI>that every Bi&s;hop by his election and confirmation, even before con&s;ecration, had ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction annexed to his office, as</HI> judex ordinarius <HI>within his dioce&s;e, and divers abbots antiently, and mo&s;t arch dea|cons to this day, by u&s;age, have had the like juri&s;diction within certain limits and precincts.</HI></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop's right to open his court being therefore &s;ecured by the common law, and that being univer&s;ally acknowledged to be the law of the colonies, his lord&s;hip will find no difficulty, after his dioce&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed, to erect a tribunal, for good rea&s;ons long di&s;gu&s;tful to the people of <HI>England;</HI> and which <HI>Americans</HI> dread to almo&s;t the &s;ame degree of horror, which they feel at the thoughts of the inqui&s;ition it&s;elf,</P>
<P>As the new Bi&s;hops will have the law on their &s;ide, &s;o the de|pendent &s;tate of the judges in the provinces, will probably favour the de&s;ign, not only of erecting tho&s;e courts, but of extending them, in all doubtful ca&s;es, mo&s;t to the advancement of epi&s;co|pal claims. To be the better under&s;tood, I will put a ca&s;e, which, if ever a Bi&s;hop &s;hould arrive in this country, will doubtle&s;s be a very common one.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that the zeal of &s;ome Engli&s;h or Dutch Calvini&s;t mini&s;ter, in &s;ome private or public controver&s;y with one of our mi&s;&s;ionaries, may let &s;lip the old accu&s;ation, that the lat|ter, in&s;tead of preaching the doctrines of the thirty nine articles of our Church, inculcates the here&s;y of Arminius; &s;uch a charge, if ill grounded, may be thought &s;ufficient to &s;upport a libel for de|famation; upon complaint, the Bi&s;hop's court will doubtle&s;s or|der proce&s;s to i&s;&s;ue: A defendant wrongfully impleded there, mu&s;t apply for his relief to the judges at common law, for a prohibi|tion to his lord&s;hip. But if the matter is proper for &s;piritual cog|nizance, or even dubious, what pro&s;pect will there be of &s;ucce&s;s; while my lord Bi&s;hop figures away in parade and intere&s;t, beyond any governor upon the continent; and the judges hold their com|mi&s;&s;ions only during plea&s;ure? The inferior clergy of our own Church, I con&s;ider as &s;o many life-guards to his lord&s;hip, and
<PB N="33" REF="010857_0017_0F8524DBEC7AB418">&s;upported by their letters in his favour, and his own connections with the reverend bench in the mother country, no remon&s;trance on the part of the judges, will &s;ecure them from calumny and mi&s;|repre&s;entation. In &s;o unequal a conte&s;t, every irre&s;olute judge will become the dupe of the clergy; and what hopeful effects the epi&s;copal influence will then have upon liberty and property, is ea&s;ier to fore&s;ee, than to de&s;cribe. In a word, as no lay charac|ters in this country will be a match for the Bi&s;hop's, in point of fortune, &s;plendor, power and intere&s;t, not a man will mount the ladder of perferment, without his Lord&s;hip's aid; and we may have the mortification to &s;ee the officers of government, from his Maje&s;ty's council, down to a ju&s;tice of the peace, courting the par|&s;on of a pari&s;h, to recommend them to the favour of a haughty prelate, who will doubtle&s;s monopolize, by the creatures of his power, all po&s;ts and places civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and military.</P>
<P>If any man thinks the&s;e the vi&s;ionary dreams of an extravagant de&s;pondency, or an over-weaning attachment to <HI>American</HI> liberty; I mu&s;t reply, in my turn, that <HI>his</HI> ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, are owing to his ignorance of the nature and extent of the &s;piritual court; and the countenance given to it by the common law it&s;elf. The Bi&s;hop has a throne of judgment for all &s;candals upon the Chri&s;tian name, and two &s;colds cannot fling out the charge of whoredom, free from his Lord&s;hip's controul. Under him there will be a regiment of deans, and chapters, arch-deans, and prebendaries, vicars-gene|ral, chancellors, commi&s;&s;aries, officials, regi&s;ters, deputy regi&s;ters, apparitors, proctors, and advocates, who all practi&s;e as our admi|ralty courts do, according to the cour&s;e of the civil law, and will, (if the Engli&s;h models prevail,) be maintained by a table of fees which by emptying the pockets of the unhappy delinquents, will teach them with a witne&s;s, to beware of the cen&s;ures of the Church.</P>
<P>But the &s;harpe&s;t arrow in his Lord&s;hip's quiver, is the power of excommunication.</P>
<P>This is a cen&s;ure by which the defaulting party is, for a time, ca&s;t out of the communion of the church. In the primitive age it con&s;i&s;ted in the deprivation of the u&s;e of the &s;acrament; but as wickedne&s;s abounded, the puni&s;hment was contemned, and the <HI>temporal</HI> grandeur of the church made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uper-add <HI>temporal</HI> &s;anctions.</P>
<P>At this day excommunications are divided into the le&s;&s;er and greater. By the fir&s;t, the offender is deprived of the &s;acraments and divine wor&s;hip; and it is denounced for di&s;obeying the proce&s;s of the Bi&s;hop's court: But the greater excommunication inhibits a man from the &s;ociety or conver&s;ation of the faithful; and by a con&s;titution of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Stratford,</HI> they who even trade or com|municate with per&s;ons excommunicated, are puni&s;hable by eccle|&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure. <HI>Lind.</HI> 266.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="010857_0018_0F8524DCC6DD1098">
As to its con&s;equences, according to the cour&s;e of the common law, they are, a di&s;ability to commence any action; and hence the excommunication of the plaintiff is pleadable in abatement to his &s;uit; nor can he be a witne&s;s, advocate or juror, nor di&s;po&s;e of his e&s;tate by te&s;tament: It al&s;o &s;u&s;pends an executor&s;hip; nor &s;hall his remains, according to the rubrick in the Book of Com|mon Prayer, have the honour of the burial office, and Chri&s;tian interment.

<P>Such being the &s;everity of the &s;entence of excommunication, I believe few Americans wi&s;h to &s;ee a judicatory erected to give the law on this head, an opportunity of being applied: And the ad|vocate for an <HI>American Epi&s;copate</HI> mu&s;t be an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e, if this is the di&s;cipline he longs to have exerci&s;ed: For tho' the Doctor admits, that our Clergymen at pre&s;ent may, and ought, to refu&s;e the communion to di&s;orderly and &s;candalous per&s;ons, he wi&s;hes for the re&s;toration of &s;omething more efficacious; but what that is, he has rather left to our conjecture, than clearly explained.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE violent clap of thunder wherewith this city had for a week before been daily threatened, was la&s;t Monday morn|ing at about &s;ix minutes after ten (attended with a great &s;now &s;torm, and &s;ome rain,) impetuou&s;ly di&s;charged from our American Vatican, having been, after great con&s;ultation, agreed to be hurl|ed, by the coru&s;catious arm of Mr. <HI>Secretary Seabury:</HI> but very fortunately for man, bea&s;t, and buildings, the bolt wanting an e&s;|&s;ential quality to do execution, we cannot learn that any creature, rational, animal, or material, hath received the lea&s;t damage from the explo&s;ion. With re&s;pect to the <HI>American Whig,</HI> for whom this nitra-&s;ulphureous fulmination was expre&s;ly fabricated, and at who&s;e pericardium it was point-blank levelled, it hath not &s;o much as &s;inged a &s;ingle thread of his garments. The reverend &s;ecre|tary begins with &s;olemnly affirming, that the <HI>convention have ne|ver made any injurious reflections upon the other denominations, by repre&s;enting them either as &s;editious incendiaries, or as di&s;affected to the king and government.</HI> This affirmation happens unfortu|nately to re&s;pect a matter of fact which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to know: For the convention being no corporation, they do not want any of his in&s;trumentality to authenticate their acts. He can therefore only declare this on the <HI>poor, &s;imple,</HI> "I am told," which is not worth one farthing more than the <HI>poor, &s;imple,</HI> "we are told," of <HI>the American Whig;</HI> with which he is neverthele&s;s in &s;o violent a taking. After having delivered this part of his
<PB N="35" REF="010857_0018_0F8524DCC6DD1098">te&s;timony, <HI>which is nothing to the purpo&s;e,</HI> he proceeds in the fol|lowing elegant and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate language. <Q>I do moreover af|firm and declare, that this A&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> is ab&s;olutely, utterly, and intirely fal&s;e, and groundle&s;s. And I hereby call upon <HI>him</HI> in this open Manner <HI>both as a member of, and a Secretary to the Convention,</HI> publickly to produce the Au|thority upon which he has a&s;&s;erted &s;o infamous a Fal&s;ehood. In this Ca&s;e the mo&s;t po&s;itive Proof is in&s;i&s;ted on, nor will the re|&s;pectable Public be put off with a poor, &s;imple, "we are told," which is nothing to the purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Should any Per&s;on think that I do not treat this Writer with proper Re&s;pect, let him turn to the la&s;t Paragraph of the <HI>Ame|rican Whig,</HI> No. I. where Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> and the Convention, (Gentlemen at lea&s;t as reputable as him&s;elf) are in Fact accu&s;ed of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Fal&s;ehood and Deceit, in pretending to a&s;k for a Bi&s;hop only upon the Plan propo&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> while it is, not the primitive Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop they want," but, &amp;c. Such a Piece of Effrontery and Malice, I think, de&s;erves, and would ju&s;tify wor&s;e Treatment than a Regard to my own Character would &s;uffer me to give him.</Q> Before I give any direct an&s;wer to the charge brought again&s;t me I mu&s;t in my turn complain of an injury little inferior to that about which he makes &s;o tremen|dous an outcry. It appears evident, by his &s;aying, that <HI>Doctor</HI> Chandler, <HI>and the Convention were gentlemen at lea&s;t as re&s;pecta|ble as my&s;elf,</HI> that he is acquainted with my per&s;onal character; and yet he has had the a&s;&s;urance to a&s;&s;ert, that I am <HI>both Secretary and a member of the Convention,</HI> which he knows in his own con|&s;cience, (to u&s;e his own tautological epithets) to be <HI>ab&s;olutely, ut|terly, and intirely fal&s;e, and groundle&s;s.</HI> For <HI>I do affirm and de|clare,</HI> that I never was either the one or the other; and I take it extremely unkind, to be placed pending the law-&s;uit between the Convention and the Public, among&s;t &s;uch <HI>unpopular</HI> company. As to the remainder of this mo&s;t delicate compo&s;ition, I would ob|&s;erve, that our Secretary did not con&s;ider, (and indeed who in &s;uch a <HI>flu&s;tratious</HI> ferment could be capable of any con&s;ideration) that the re&s;pectable Public, before whom the cau&s;e is now at i&s;&s;ue, is intitled to the highe&s;t proof of which the nature of the thing will admit. They will therefore not be &s;atisfied with the bare <HI>verbum &s;acerdotis,</HI> while &s;uch &s;uperior evidence remains in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The proof which they have a right to expect is, that he forthwith publi&s;h true copies of all the petitions, that were written and &s;ent on that occa&s;ion, noting what was in the origi|nal drafts, and &s;truck out by a few moderate members of the Con|vention, (for luckily for the colonies a few &s;uch there happened to be, or no mortal can tell of what we &s;hould not have been accu&s;ed) and that &s;uch publications be declared to be true copies, upon
<PB N="36" REF="010857_0019_0F8524E1D8C74300">oath. When this is done, the <HI>American Whig</HI> will have the plea|&s;ure of &s;urpri&s;ing him with a &s;ecret he little &s;u&s;pects. In the mean time, I would advi&s;e him to lift up hands <HI>without wrath, as well as without doubting;</HI> though I &s;hould not have the lea&s;t ob|jection again&s;t in&s;tantly &s;uffering the execution of his menaces, did I not flatter my&s;elf, that my life is of &s;ome moment to the Public, while I am engaged in exerting my endeavours to avert the terri|ble cur&s;e of an <HI>American Epi&s;copate.</HI> This being accompli&s;hed, the Secretary, or any of his brethren, the di&s;ciples and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of peace, may u&s;e what violence they plea&s;e, and put me to death in their own way and manner; as I &s;hould really expect to die with va&s;tly greater cheerfulne&s;s and &s;erenity, on be|ing able to reflect, that I had, in any degree been in&s;trumental in defeating &s;o portentous a project. Relative to my &s;aying, that I do not believe <HI>Doctor</HI> Chandler <HI>and the Convention want a pri|mitive Bi&s;hop;</HI> I have hitherto &s;een no rea&s;on for repentance, but on the contrary, <HI>Know all men by the&s;e pre&s;ents,</HI> that I do hereby <HI>declare and affirm,</HI> that I do not, nor ever &s;hall, believe any thing like it; it being <HI>ab&s;olutely, utterly, and intirely</HI> incredible, that they &s;hould be &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ignorant, as not to know the impo&s;&s;i|bility of the thing. For that it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible (<HI>I &s;hould &s;ay ab&s;olutely, utterly, and intirely</HI> impo&s;&s;ible) I &s;hall abundantly &s;hew, in &s;ome &s;ucceeding numbers of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> to their ex|treme mortification, and the full &s;atisfaction of the Public; and if this my incredulity is to be termed <HI>effrontery</HI> and <HI>malice,</HI> this Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Secretary de&s;erves to be told, that he has involved forty nine fiftieths of the whole province in the &s;ame anathematical pre|dicament.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Ob&s;erve you have vigorou&s;ly undertaken a controver&s;y with <HI>Doctor Ch&mdash;r.</HI> Now in all controver&s;ie, or di&s;pute, a good Chri&s;tian, who is deeply &s;en&s;ible that he mu&s;t give an account of every idle word, will &s;ingly aim at nothing but the truth and right of the ca&s;e: But this, (by the manner of your beginning,) does not &s;eem to me, (a By-&s;tander,) to be what you aim at, but rather to beget in your readers, all the odium you can again&s;t the <HI>Doctor,</HI> his cau&s;e, and his friends. A good cau&s;e does not need &s;uch a method of proceeding. It is certain that the <HI>Doctor</HI> has pleaded his cau&s;e in a calm, &s;erious, and candid manner, and as it becomes a Chri&s;tian. What the world expects therefore, is, that you &s;hould in the &s;ame manner undertake to an&s;wer him, and &s;ay no|thing, and attend to nothing, but the real merits of the cau&s;e.
<PB N="37" REF="010857_0019_0F8524E1D8C74300">The only que&s;tion of much importance, relates to the rights of con&s;cience, and the liberty every man ought to have, to think and act for him&s;elf, in matters of religion.&mdash;It is this, whether the Church hath not a right to enjoy the whole of its own con&s;titution, as well as its neighbours? And &s;ince this is not the fact in this coun|try, whether we have not an undoubted right, and whether it is not mo&s;t rea&s;onable, that, at this di&s;tance, we &s;hould be peaceably allowed, (even by a Whig) to enjoy our own Epi&s;copal form of government, as well as our neighbours their Pre&s;byterian form? Every thing foreign to this, is quite be&s;ide the que&s;tion.&mdash;Pray, therefore, Mr. <HI>Whig,</HI> attend only to this point, and let us &s;ee fair play.</P>
<P>Whether right or wrong, is not now the que&s;tion, nor is it to be decided by ridicule, but by &s;ober rea&s;on; and I hope Mr. <HI>Whig,</HI> (as it does not become you,) you are not &s;o uncharitable as to think, but that we may be as con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded of our Epi&s;|copal form, as our neighbours of their Pre&s;byterian. We do &s;o|lemnly declare, that we are; nor can you be more con&s;cientious in your way, than we in ours; tell us, then, why we ought not to enjoy ours, as well as you yours? We &s;eriou&s;ly declare, we do not envy you yours; why then, in the name of all that is good, &s;hould you be &s;o bitterly &s;et again&s;t our enjoying ours? Is not liberty our right as well as your's?</P>
<P>You affectedly cry out, with dreadful terror, of the danger of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny: But pray Mr. <HI>Whig</HI> be &s;ober; you <HI>fear, where no fear is;</HI> there is no danger; you can't, (and you know you can't) be more aver&s;e to tyranny, in any &s;hape, than we are. And be&s;ides, you know we a&s;k for no Epi&s;copate that can have any concern with you; nor do we de&s;ire any. We only de&s;ire &s;uch a happy &s;tate for us both, as &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in this, that <HI>Ephraim</HI> may have no temptation <HI>to envy</HI> Judah, nor Judah <HI>to vex</HI> Ephraim.</P>

<P>WHEN a writer publickly attacks men of good character, with virulence, and endeavours by &s;ophi&s;try, to &s;et truths, which are held &s;acred by many &s;incere Chri&s;tians, in a di&s;advantageous light; it may be proper to inquire into his temper and charac|ter, and the motives which &s;et him to work.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, I confe&s;s, do not much affect the intrin&s;ic value of any literary compo&s;ition: But if this latter has a pernici|ous
<PB N="38" REF="010857_0020_0F8524E1FAB9DFE0">tendency&mdash;either to &s;ow di&s;&s;entions, or rai&s;e prejudices among hone&s;t men,&mdash;to unhinge religion, or un&s;ettle any of its principles: The &s;hewing what quarter it comes from, will often go a good way to confute it.</P>
<P>Thus&mdash;if a man of unmeaning phyz, &s;hould think proper to de&s;|pi&s;e every animated countenance,&mdash;or, if a man of rueful length of face, &s;hould take it into his head to declaim again&s;t round faces, and in&s;i&s;t that there is no comeline&s;s in any but &s;uch as have the &s;ame degree of longitude with his own, reviling all who di&s;&s;ented in opinion from him&mdash;If a libertine &s;hould write again&s;t religion, and try to per&s;uade people to throw off all concern about it;&mdash;if a bu&s;y factor in di&s;&s;ention, who has long been a hackneyed jour|neyman in defamation, &s;hould begin to &s;catter his poi&s;on, in order to &s;et well-meaning people together by the ears; all who know the&s;e circum&s;tances, would immediately be on their guard: A knowledge of them would &s;erve as an antidote again&s;t the mi&s;chief which artful &s;ophi&s;try might otherwi&s;e produce.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> and his <HI>Appeal to the Public, in behalf of the Church of England in America,</HI> have lately been attacked with great indecency and fury, by the <HI>American Whig.</HI> Now if it hap|pens that this attack comes from an ambitious, di&s;appointed fac|tion, the members of which are well known to have been always enemies to the Church of England; who have wantonly endea|voured to revile it,&mdash;to ridicule many of tho&s;e truths which its members hold &s;acred,&mdash;and who make religion a political engine to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns; The unprejudiced reader, upon knowing this, will treat it with that neglect and contempt it de|&s;erves.</P>
<P>To check the in&s;olence of this faction, is now become nece&s;&s;ary for many rea&s;ons. It is high time for the members of the Church of England, who&s;e lenity has been much and often abu&s;ed by them, to vindicate them&s;elves from the fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions of the&s;e enemies to peace; and admini&s;ter &s;ome whole&s;ome di&s;cipline to the author, or authors of the <HI>American Whig;</HI>&mdash;which paper is to be the future vehicle of their malice. No. I. is &s;tuffed with low, &s;purious wittici&s;ms, mi&s;repre&s;entations, &s;currility, buffoonery, fal&s;hood, abu&s;e, and &s;lander. But to pa&s;s by all the&s;e, the author de&s;erves flagellation for his blunders, with which this piece is plen|tifully begrimed. Take the following &s;ample of the&s;e, gentle rea|der, for the pre&s;ent, which I beg you would carefully ob&s;erve. He &s;ays, the <HI>Appeal</HI> "&s;o naturally counterfeits the voice of a &s;heep, that it is not every reader who will di&s;criminate it from that of a wolf." As much as to &s;ay,&mdash;it &s;ings &s;o like a Nightingale, that you can &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h its voice from that of a hoar&s;e croak|ing Raven. Or, a thing is &s;o like an egg, that you can &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h it from an oy&s;ter. This is the mighty man who is to
<PB N="39" REF="010857_0020_0F8524E1FAB9DFE0">adju&s;t with preci&s;ion the limits of religious Liberty, and defend it from all encroachment! And great things, no doubt, are to be expected from him.</P>
<P>What were the motives of the pre&s;ent attack on the <HI>Appeal?</HI> Not any thing demanded in the <HI>Appeal</HI> it&s;elf, nor the manner in which it is executed. It is written with great moderation, and a&s;ks nothing but what every denomination of Chri&s;tians has a right to, and actually enjoys in America, the Church of England only excepted;&mdash;namely, the liberty of having the in&s;titutions of our Church, with its forms of di&s;cipline and government, to which a Bi&s;hop, or Bi&s;hops, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. Yet &s;till with this re&s;triction,&mdash; <Q>That the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, &s;hall have no authority, put purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the Church, and not from the &s;tate. That his authority &s;hall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laity, or Di&s;&s;enters of any Denomination. That the Bi&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the property or privileges, whether civil or religious, of Church|men or Di&s;&s;enters. That, in particular, they &s;hall have no con|cern with the probate of wills, letters of guardian&s;hip, and ad|mini&s;tration, or marriage licences, nor be judges of any ca&s;es re|lating thereto. But that they &s;hall only exerci&s;e the original powers of their office, namely, <HI>ordain</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> the Clergy, and admini&s;ter <HI>Confirmation</HI> to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appeal to the public, p. <HI>79.</HI></NOTE></Q> This is the whole of what is de&s;ired by the <HI>Appeal;</HI> nor does the warme&s;t advocates for American Bi&s;hops even wi&s;h for more.</P>
<P>The <HI>American Whig</HI> him&s;elf, acknowledges that the Appeal "a&s;ks nothing but what is highly rea&s;onable." And the &s;uppo&s;ed author of this Numb. with others of his fraternity have frequently owned it was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that the Church of England, in America, &s;hould have Bi&s;hops on the&s;e terms; nor does it ap|pear that there was any intention, until very lately, of writing again&s;t it in this place.</P>
<P>What could occa&s;ion this change of &s;entiment,&mdash;this &s;udden attack on the Appeal? All the&s;e doleful apprehen&s;ions, as if it were replete with utter ruin to the colonies? Tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with &s;ome late tran&s;actions in this city, can ea&s;ily an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions. Men who are &s;olely guided by ambition and in|tere&s;t, are never &s;teady in their conduct. While you gratify the&s;e, they will be quiet, &mdash; but no longer. Thwart them in the lea&s;t, and they are like &s;o many bears robbed of their whelps. They will indi&s;criminately wreak their vengeance on all that come in their way. To gratify it&mdash;</P>

I wi&s;h them joy of their company.</P>
<P>The Appeal had been read and con&s;idered long enough after its publication. If not approved, why was it not then objected to? The rea&s;on was, no ambitious attempts were then oppo&s;ed,&mdash;no towering expectations were bla&s;ted. Matters went on &s;moothly; and had they gone on in the &s;ame manner &s;ince, the Appeal might have remained in peace, without any mole&s;tation from this quar|ter, notwith&s;tanding its <HI>tremendous</HI> con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Whig</HI> pragmatically a&s;&s;umes to be defender-general of the <Q>religious Privileges of all Denominations of prote&s;tants, again&s;t the &s;ecret or open attempts of their enemies.</Q> He mu&s;t be a cunning fellow indeed to <HI>know</HI> and counteract tho&s;e attempts which are <HI>&s;ecret.</HI> But to let this pa&s;s. Who a&s;&s;igned him this po&s;t? Or, who are the&s;e enemies? If by the&s;e he means the <HI>author</HI> of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> and his friends, why was not this made appear be|fore? If he had &s;uch a regard, as he pretends, for the religious Liberties of others,&mdash;if the <HI>Appeal</HI> had any tendency to infringe tho&s;e: Surely this magnanimous Champion would not have &s;lum|bered and &s;lept &s;o long! The truth is as I have mentioned. The &s;pirit of ambition and &s;elf intere&s;t, had not met with any ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck 'till very lately. But now that their blooming hopes are withered, the faction is enraged to a degree of phrenzy; and the poor Church, thro' the Appeal, mu&s;t fall the devoted victim of their vengeance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is more than probable that the &s;ame motives &s;et &s;ome Phila|delphia engineers to work, in writing a paper called the <HI>Centinel:</HI> for in No. I. the tran&s;actions alluded to above, are mentioned.

As the Church of England has &s;everal able advocates in Penn&s;ylvania, I doubt not but &s;ome of them will take the Centinel to ta&s;k, and give him proper ca&s;|tigation.

Some pretence however was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;torm the <HI>Appeal;</HI> and one was found of an extraordinary kind,&mdash;&s;uch perhaps as would be the la&s;t thought on by a per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t moderate portion of hone&s;ty and charity. And what was it? Why this&mdash; <Q>It is not a primitive, Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop, that the Dr. and the Convention want. It is a modern, &s;plendid, opulent, Court-fa|voured, law-dignified, &s;uperb, magnificent, powerful prelate, on which their heart is &s;o intent.</Q></P>
<P>Now to pa&s;s over the defects of this la&s;t wonderful period, in point of propriety and &s;tyle,&mdash;the whole of it I aver to be utterly fal&s;e. There is not a &s;yllable of truth in it. And here I publickly call on this Gentleman to make good his a&s;&s;ertion,&mdash;to produce &s;ome &s;ort of &s;atisfactory evidence, be&s;ides his own bare word, which on this occa&s;ion will not go far, that the Dr. and Convention de|&s;ire &s;uch a Bi&s;hop. Until he gives &s;ome proof of this, he does nothing at all. He fights with a phantom his own imagination has rai&s;ed. Like his illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;or, Don Quixote, he en|counters wind-mills in&s;tead of giants. He might as well write again&s;t introducing the Pope of Rome, or Mufti of Con&s;tantino|ple, and it would be as much to the purpo&s;e: As writing again&s;t the introduction of &s;uch a Bi&s;hop into America, as no one mem|ber of the CHURCH, either de&s;ires, or wi&s;hes for. I repeat it again, that until the author of the American Whig produces &s;ome au|thentic proof or te&s;timonies, that the Clergy want &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as he has &s;pecified,&mdash;that they want <Q>to involve America in ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical bondage,</Q> introduce "&s;piritual courts," &amp;c. as he in&s;inuates: He &s;tands convicted by his own declaration, when he &s;ays, <Q>the Appeal a&s;ks nothing but what is highly rea&s;onable,&mdash; and it were manife&s;t inju&s;tice to deny church-men, what in their opinion, their eternal &s;alvation &s;o greatly depends on.</Q> But if he cannot produce any &s;uch authentic proof or te&s;timony, which I am fully a&s;&s;ured he cannot do, the world mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look on him as an invidious calumniator, a <HI>fal&s;e accu&s;er</HI> of the brethren; and certainly he knows very well what an ancient, powerful coad|jutor he has in this.</P>
<P>This writer di&s;claims the &s;etters of order and &s;y&s;tem in his fu|ture productions; and were I to &s;uppo&s;e the rea&s;on of his doing &s;o, is becau&s;e his principles are oppo&s;ite to all order, it would be &s;hewing him full as much, if not more, charity, than he has &s;hewed to Dr. Chandler and the Convention.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING opened the general tendency of Dr. chandler's ap|peal, &amp;c. I &s;hall now proceed to make &s;ome remarks on the inconveniencies and mi&s;chiefs of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>The Doctor, as hath been &s;hewn, endeavours to engage "our &s;uperiors in England," "the guardians of the national intere&s;ts" on his &s;ide, by endeavouring to make them believe, that without an <HI>epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> here, they mu&s;t not expect due obedience from the colonies; nay that the &s;tate is not &s;afe. It hath, at all times, been the policy of ambitious eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to per&s;uade the civil magi&s;trate, that nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tate, and even his particular intere&s;t required him to interfere in their behalf, and inve&s;t them with dignity and power; and then he ought to oblige all per&s;ons to Church conformity, and to enforce obedience by civil di&s;abili|ties and penalties, though &s;uch a conduct is obviou&s;ly an inva&s;ion
<PB N="43" REF="010857_0022_0F8524E4AF3795E0">of the rights of mankind, and tends to di&s;turb the public peace, which can only be effectually re&s;tored, by removing the iniquitous re&s;traint, which introduced the mi&s;chief.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Equality among &s;ubjects is the great &s;ource of concord." <HI>HUME.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was the only lawgiver in his Church. He expre&s;ly commands his followers to <HI>"call no man father upon earth,"</HI> and adds <HI>"neither be ye called ma&s;ter, for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t;"</HI> Math. xxiii. 9.10. words which obvi|ou&s;ly mean to exclude all religous obedience, or claims to dictate to con&s;cience on the footing of human authority; yet how com|monly have Church governors, under all e&s;tabli&s;hments, a&s;&s;umed the place of God, and demanded a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as &s;inful, as the exerci&s;e of the power was unju&s;t and impious. Indeed the Church of Rome, by &s;etting up a pretended <HI>infallibility</HI> have a more &s;peci|ous tho' fal&s;e pretence to contend for uniformity.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, whoever peru&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, ever &s;ince the time of Con&s;tantine, will find it contains little el&s;e than the follies, ab&s;urdities, frauds, rapine, pride, domination, rage, and cruelty of &s;piritual tyrants; who practi&s;ed every artifice to per|&s;uade, or cajole the temporal rulers to &s;upport their mea&s;ures. They told them, that as the King's of I&s;rael were bound, under that very &s;ingular kind of government, a Theo|cracy, to pre&s;erve purity in religion, &s;o were Chri&s;tian Princes obliged on pain of damnation, to root out error; even by racks and tortures, &s;word and fire. How ill this horrid doctrine be|came the followers of the meek and holy Je&s;us, who refu&s;ed with indignation to call for divine judgments on the &s;chi&s;matical Sama|ritans, needs not at this day to be explained. Now the &s;ame &s;pirit, which not content with the many thou&s;ands already con|tributed for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Bi&s;hop, calls for aid from eve|ry quarter, even for a tax on all other denominations, in provin|ces where the epi&s;copalians are not a fortieth, perhaps not a fif|tieth part of the community; the &s;ame &s;pirit, which repre&s;ents the body of the people as diaffected to government and dangerous to the &s;tate, and would di&s;able them from holding civil offices; the &s;ame &s;pirit that unchurches all their Chri&s;tian neighbours, merely for the want of a particular form of Church govern|ment, no ways e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity; and becau&s;e they make no preten&s;ions to a certain whim&s;ical <HI>uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> of Bi&s;hops from the Apo&s;tles, which counteracts the prin|ciples of the reformation, and can &s;erve only to &s;anctify the ty|ranny of their order; this &s;pirit would beyond all doubt, carry the abu&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical domination, as high as ever <HI>Laud</HI> and his brethren did, or as far as Doctor <HI>Sacheverell</HI> contended for, if the civil magi&s;trate could but be deluded once more to lend his aid. Indeed as a great writer &s;peaks "it requires an uncommon
<PB N="44" REF="010857_0023_0F8524E5B21336C0">degree of grace and virtue in the clergy, not to abu&s;e &s;o dange|rous a power."</P>
<P>Thanks be to our wi&s;er &s;tate&s;men, of late <HI>&s;piritual power</HI> has been kept within bounds, and Di&s;&s;enters in England have been &s;uffered to wor&s;hip God peaceably according to their con&s;ciences; and many of the Clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, with a truly Chri&s;|tian temper, have written and preached in favour of toleration. It is evident however, that to maintain the toleration, and &s;up|port the rights of con&s;cience, the government has been careful to promote in the Church, men of moderation only, and at the &s;ame time, has thought it expedient to prevent the convocation from meeting to do bu&s;ine&s;s for fifty years pa&s;t. They fear there is &s;till enough of the old leaven left, to work up abundance of mi&s;|chief, whenever times &s;hall permit; and on this account dare not hazard the lea&s;t alteration in any thing e&s;tabli&s;hed, either as to doctrine, di&s;cipline, wor&s;hip or ceremony, however nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Although the body of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy have taken the li|berty of departing from the ancient doctrines, as &s;et forth in the <HI>thirty-nine articles,</HI> yet they are tenacious of the words of their &s;ervice book, and of every rite, mode and ceremony to the la&s;t degree. They would di&s;turb the public peace, and &s;et the populace, in an uproar with the old cry, <HI>The Church is in danger,</HI> if an Jota in outward form &s;hould be taken away. Rather than &s;uffer eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority to be ex|plained, and regulated on a &s;criptural footing, they choo&s;e to let matters, however repugnant to Chri&s;tianity, continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate; and are deaf to the loud complaints which many good men among them&s;elves, make of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome alter|ation. They may write <HI>Candid di&s;qui&s;itions,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;hew un|an&s;werably wherein great amendments and improvements ought to be made in the wor&s;hip of their Church, till they are tired; but the people educated in a narrow attachment to forms, and from their infancy, taught to look on every part of their own, as e&s;&s;ential to the true wor&s;hip of God, are ea&s;ily led to &s;hut their ears again&s;t every propo&s;al of alteration, and to revile the authors as betrayers of religion: An incurable evil this, ari&s;ing partly from the u&s;e of forms, but e&s;pecially from the rigid manner in which governors in Church and &s;tate, almo&s;t ever &s;ince the refor|mation, have pre&s;&s;ed uniformity.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to a&s;&s;ert that the principles of the epi&s;copal Churches tend more particularly to the&s;e abu&s;es, than tho&s;e of others; but it is the fault of human nature, which can|not bear great power with equanimity, and perhaps is mo&s;t apt to abu&s;e it in religious matters. The high rank and large revenues of the Bi&s;hops in England mu&s;t tempt them, however into this error, more ea&s;ily, than the leaders in Churches who&s;e influence depends on per&s;onal qualifications only.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="010857_0023_0F8524E5B21336C0">
The Doctor &s;trongly hints the need of an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the colonies for the purpo&s;es of di&s;cipline, his words are <Q>Churches are &s;et up again&s;t Churches, and tho&s;e who are rejected by one are received by another.</Q> (31) This complaint comes &s;ome|what unexpectedly from a mi&s;&s;ionary of the &s;ociety: The Doctor would do well to explain which Church among us, is mo&s;t re|markable for undermining the di&s;cipline of the re&s;t by receiving, with open arms, their outca&s;ts or de&s;erters; how many of the&s;e are among the mi&s;&s;ionaries, I leave the Doctor to tell? On this &s;ubject I would likewi&s;e a&s;k him, how the primitive Churches managed? They had no coercive aid from without, nor did they &s;tand in the lea&s;t need of any; yet their di&s;cipline was rather &s;e|vere; for if a Church member had not e&s;teemed it his honour and felicity (next to plea&s;ing God) to &s;tand well with his fellow-Chri&s;|tians, his pre&s;ence in their a&s;&s;emblies would have given them no &s;atisfaction. Far from &s;eeking to enlarge their &s;ociety by court|ing the rich and great, or attracting the herd of nominal profe&s;|&s;ors into member&s;hip, by winking at their irregularities and vices, they cha&s;ed out of the Church all back &s;liders and &s;candalous per|&s;ons without re&s;erve. At the &s;ame time the terms of communion were as large as the great head of the church had left them; unembarra&s;&s;ed with the trifling niceties of modern uniformity; which by fixing men's zeal on modes and ceremonies, habits and ge&s;tures, has diverted them from the weightier matters of the law, whil&s;t forbearance, charity, and other Chri&s;tian virtues have been neglected and forgotten.</P>
<P>Religious e&s;tabli&s;hments are very hardly kept from great cor|ruption; but if the provi&s;ion made for the Clergy be large, and the leaders are enabled to live in grandeur, it is not likely they &s;hould long continue pure. Ambitious worldly-minded men, who &s;eek the fleece, not the well-being of the flock, will in&s;inu|ate them&s;elves into the chief offices; their example and influence will mi&s;lead or di&s;courage others, who in better company might have been u&s;efully employed; the indu&s;try and vigilance of the &s;piritual guides in the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of their function will be re|laxed; and that &s;kill in their profe&s;&s;ion which practice, &s;tudy, and attention alone can give, will not be attained. Secure in their &s;alaries, they may look on it as &s;uperfluous to be further active, than ju&s;t to keep up &s;ome decent appearance of duty. Thus preacher and people will indolently go to &s;leep, and forget the important me&s;&s;ages and warnings of heaven, which from the intervention of earthly and pre&s;ent objects, are but too apt to e&s;cape our attention, under the mo&s;t diligent admini&s;tration of God's word. And &s;hould the evil proceed yet f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther, and the Clergy, in&s;tead of being "examples to their flock," &s;et before them patterns of <HI>irregular living, open immorality,</HI> and <HI>daring
<PB N="46" REF="010857_0024_0F8524E66F09EA78">wickedne&s;s,</HI> will it not be readily granted that there can be no re|ligion at all among the zealots for an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;o enormou&s;ly corrupted; of which yet we want not dreadful in&s;tances in Church hi&s;tory, as well as our own daily ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But &s;till wor&s;e than this: There is no probability of religion's being reformed under the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical polities. Nothing le&s;s than a &s;tate convul&s;ion effected the reformation, in mo&s;t of the countries where it took place. Generally the body of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Clergy, in&s;tead of promoting, violently oppo&s;ed it, by the help of tho&s;e very emoluments and advantages which had been granted for the &s;upport of religion; and in &s;ome kingdoms they &s;ucceeded: And even &s;ince that glorious period, have we not &s;een the like difficulties &s;tand in the way on every occa&s;ion? Bi&s;hop Burnet very plea&s;ant &s;ays, in &s;ome of his writings, "we ac|knowledge our Church liable to <HI>err</HI> in the <HI>general,</HI> but when you come to <HI>particulars</HI> we are <HI>always</HI> in the <HI>right.</HI>" Under the &s;pe|cious pretence of keeping out dangerous innovations and errors, no mi&s;takes or corruptions, however hurtful or di&s;graceful, are allowed to be corrected. <Q>One might as well &s;ay Churches and Chapels need no repair, tho' ca&s;tles and hou&s;es do; whereas commonly to &s;peak the truth, dilapidations of the inward and &s;piritual edifices of the Church, are in all times as great as the outward and material.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bacon,</HI> on the peace of the Church.</NOTE></Q> But above all, the mo&s;t dreadful evil is the danger of per&s;ecution; which worldly minded men to gratify their own pride and lu&s;t of power, are forward on pro|per occa&s;ions to practi&s;e; and which weak men with better inten|tions, are too apt to be led into. We too readily think our&s;elves &s;ecure from error, if we have the wi&s;e, the powerful, and the many, in our opinions. Tho&s;e who differ from us we conclude mu&s;t be ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e; and are without much difficulty brought to look on it, as an act of charity as well as duty, to ad|mini&s;ter &s;ome whole&s;ome re&s;traints and &s;everities to &s;uch manife&s;t heretics. Thus is the pride of &s;uppo&s;ed right opinion nouri&s;hed under e&s;tabli&s;hments, till from one &s;tep to another in the practice of hard&s;hips on di&s;&s;enters, we ea&s;ily proceed to inqui&s;itions, tor|tures, and death. For if penalties can be ju&s;tified in religious mat|ters, perhaps the mo&s;t violent may be the mo&s;t merciful, as well as effectual. "Impri&s;onments, fines, and whipping, &s;erve only to irritate the &s;ects, without di&s;abling them from re&s;i&s;tance; but the wheel, the gibbet and the &s;take mu&s;t &s;oon root out, or bani&s;h, all non-conformi&s;ts."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Was plea&s;ed to &s;ee by your Adverti&s;ement in la&s;t Thur&s;|day's New-York Journal, that you intend to republi&s;h in your Paper, the Pieces &s;ign'd <HI>An American Whig,</HI> together with the An&s;wers, and the be&s;t Pieces that come out in the other Papers upon the Subject of that Controver&s;y, on both Sides of the Que&s;tion. The Exhibition of the Arguments on both Sides in the &s;ame Paper, is certainly the mo&s;t likely Means to enable the Reader to form a ju&s;t and equitable Judgment;&mdash;and if we mu&s;t needs be forced into this religious Controver&s;y, your Propo|&s;al bids the faire&s;t for deciding it according to Truth and Ju&s;tice. But at the &s;ame Time, as a hearty Friend to the Briti&s;h Colonies, I cannot but expre&s;s my Concern, that this Controver&s;y &s;hould have been begun at &s;uch a Time as this,&mdash;when the united Ef|forts
<PB N="48" REF="010857_0025_0F8524E7200CFC90">of all the Colonies are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of their Con&s;titutional Rights and Liberties.</P>
<P>The Introduction of &s;uch a Di&s;pute at this Time, I conceive to be in many Re&s;pects extremely injudicious,&mdash;as it will tend to take off the public Attention from the <HI>Main Chance,</HI> to di&s;unite, and &s;et us to quarreling among our &s;elves, and give our Enemies an Advantage over us: Be&s;ide the Time is quite improper for the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Subject;&mdash;When our Minds are in a State of anxious Concern,&mdash;whether we are henceforth to con|&s;ider our&s;elves as having any other Relation to Great-Britain but as being her Slaves,&mdash;whether we have any <HI>Part</HI> or <HI>Lot</HI> in her beloved Con&s;titution and the Rights of Nature&mdash;which have al|ways been our Boa&s;t and our Glory;&mdash;whether we are a Nation of generous Freemen, or of abject de&s;picable Slaves?&mdash;In &s;uch a State of dread Su&s;pence, can our Minds be in a proper Frame for determining the &s;ubtil Di&s;putes between Arminians and Calvi|ni&s;ts, Church Men and Pre&s;byterians? The&s;e Matters have of them&s;elves been often found &s;ufficient to &s;et whole Kingdoms in a Flame, and &s;hall we <HI>needle&s;sly</HI> kindle the Fire of Contention among our&s;elves, when our deare&s;t Intere&s;ts are in Danger, from fal&s;e Friends within, and open Enemies without?</P>
<P>Can we think the De&s;igns of this Author of Di&s;&s;ention, this Sower of Di&s;cord among us, are friendly to the Engli&s;h Con&s;ti|tution and Government, or the Rights of the&s;e Colonies? When <HI>the&s;e</HI> were in the mo&s;t imminent Danger of being overturned and torne from us by the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> did this Author, or his Party &s;tir a Finger to prevent it? Or have they done any Thing &s;ince, in Favour of the Engli&s;h <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> and <HI>American Rights,</HI> tho' the&s;e have been repeatedly attack'd, by the Acts, <HI>for Billeting Soldiers,</HI>&mdash;for <HI>impo&s;ing Duties,</HI> &amp;c? On the Contrary, has not this Attempt of the <HI>American Whig</HI> to di&s;unite us, a manife&s;t Tendency to bring upon us all the Evils that threaten us, and reduce us to a State of general Confu&s;ion? And is it not, from a careful Review of every Circum&s;tance, at lea&s;t highly probable, that he and his Party would rejoice in a Di&s;union between Great-Britain and her Colonies, and would be among the fir&s;t to change a <HI>Monarchical</HI> for a <HI>Republican</HI> Government? Which may Heaven avert!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;eeming candour with which thou ha&s;t thought proper to u&s;her thy performance into the world, induced me to give it a &s;erious reading, in hopes therein to find &s;omewhat tend|ing to edification. But how great was my mi&s;take when, on pe|ru&s;ing the fir&s;t &s;ection, I &s;ound thee warmly reviving the old con|trover&s;y concerning <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and torturing thy invention to produce arguments in &s;upport of an opinion which the wi&s;e&s;t people of thine own order have long given up as in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>This queer part in thy creed, however, I was willing to attri|bute to the prejudices of thy education, and the clo&s;e trammels in which thy conformity to Church di&s;cipline obliged thee to move. Accordingly I continued to read on&mdash;but greater &s;till was my concern on hearing thee a&s;&s;ert roundly that the offices of <HI>ordination</HI> and <HI>confirmation</HI> were &s;olely ve&s;ted in Bi&s;hops, hereby deriving an argument in favour of an <HI>American</HI> epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>Here I pau&s;ed, and reflected on the good character which thou ha&s;t obtained with the world.&mdash;I knew it had been &s;aid that thou wert expert in all things touching the Church, which compelled me to believe mine own information was very imperfect, being &s;o widely different from thine.</P>
<P>Thou wilt probably conclude from my mode of expre&s;&s;ion that I am of the &s;ociety called <HI>Quakers</HI>&mdash;If &s;o, thou art greatly mi&s;taken&mdash;For, tho' I agree with tho&s;e good people in &s;ome things, wherein they approach the &s;implicity of the primitive times, yet it is in tho&s;e and tho&s;e only.</P>
<P><HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>confirmation</HI> are with me indi&s;pen&s;able rites, and however overlooked by the &s;uperficial, bear the &s;eals of the Go&s;pel. Yet am I con&s;trained to differ from thee in thy partial repre&s;entation of the&s;e things. Surely thou ha&s;t forgot thy Bible, el&s;e ha&s;t thou wilfully prevaricated. For thus &s;peaks St. <HI>Paul</HI> to Bi&s;hop <HI>Timothy</HI>&mdash;"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the <HI>Pre&s;bytery.</HI> 1&s;t Epi&s;t. to <HI>Tim.</HI> chap. iv. ver. 14.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t as to <HI>ordination,</HI> if we look into an impartial account
<PB N="50" REF="010857_0026_0F8524F04FA2CEC0">given of the next centuries after CHRIST, by chancellor <HI>King,</HI> we &s;hall be convinced from many quotations which he produces, that a Pre&s;byter could perform all the Duties of a Bi&s;hop. Let us take the following, which he gives us from St. <HI>Cyprian.</HI> In his epi&s;tle to his own Clergy, he exhorts them, "to di&s;charge their own and his office too, that &s;o nothing might be wanting either to di&s;cipline or diligence."&mdash;Now do&s;t thou think, <HI>Doctor,</HI> that the Bi&s;hop, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to know his own con&s;equence. would have made &s;o free with his office, as to commit the care of it to men who, (if it had been &s;o) he mu&s;t have been appri&s;ed, could not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;charge it. No, no <HI>Doctor,</HI> the &s;uppo&s;ition is in it&s;elf ab&s;urd, and that Pre&s;byters could and did ordain, we are a&s;&s;ured from the u&s;age of the &s;ynods of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> who al|ways ordained their own Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>I believe it is a point &s;ettled on all hands, that the ceremony of <HI>confirmation</HI> in early times, was performed immediately after Bapti&s;m, and as it is well known that Pre&s;byters did <HI>Baptize,</HI> &s;o it may rea&s;onably be inferred that they <HI>confirmed</HI> likewi&s;e. To &s;ave thee the trouble of turning to the book, in which employ|ment thou will probably be du&s;t thy fingers (it being a huge folio) I will tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> in proof of my a&s;&s;er|tion, ju&s;t as I find it quoted in <HI>Peter King</HI>'s volume. <Q>As &s;oon as we come out of the bapti&s;mal laver, (&s;ays <HI>Tertullian.</HI>) we are anointed, and then are we confirmed.</Q> But now a|days, &s;ays that arch wag who &s;tyles him&s;elf a di&s;&s;enting gentle|man) as if there were &s;ome &s;uperior &s;acredne&s;s in the Bi&s;hop's than in the prie&s;t's hands, this act is, <HI>by the authority of the Church,</HI> confined to the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P><HI>Ab&s;olution</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> have often been proved to be one and the &s;ame ceremony. The intention of both was the confer|ring of the Holy Gho&s;t, and as Pre&s;byters were gifted with the powers of <HI>ab&s;olution,</HI> it &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent to deny them the pri|vilege of be&s;towing the grace of GOD at one time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> could &s;o freely impart it at another&mdash;And now having given thee my &s;entiments in few words, let me reque&s;t thee, in the &s;pi|rit of charity, to de&s;i&s;t from religious altercations; for by the time thy head is as grey as mine, thou wilt conclude with me, that they favour &s;trongly of pride&mdash;For as the good popi&s;h poet &s;aith,</P>
<Q><L>For modes of faith, let gracele&s;s zealots fight,</L>
<L><HI>His</HI> can't be <HI>wrong,</HI> who&s;e life is in the <HI>right;</HI></L>

<HEAD>A WHIP FOR THE AMERICAN WHIG. No. II.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIMOTHY TICKLE, <ABBR>ESQR</ABBR></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L><HI>In Friend&s;hip fal&s;e, implacable in Hate,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Re&s;olv'd to ruin or to rule the State.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>I Hate controver&s;y,&mdash;e&s;pecially when I mu&s;t enter the li&s;ts with an unfair, abu&s;ive adver&s;ary one who pays not the lea&s;t attention to truth or decency.&mdash;who deals out &s;lander and invective, as liberally as the famous di&s;putants of Billing&s;gate, and much in the &s;ame &s;tyle. The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>amiable</HI> characteri&s;ticks which eminently di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Faction</HI> now concerned in the <HI>American Whig.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing therefore but a regard to injured truth, could engage me in this controver&s;y. When that <HI>Church,</HI> which is the glory and bulwark of the reformation, is &s;o in&s;olently traduced,&mdash; and traduced by tho&s;e whom it tolerates and protects,&mdash;when its rights are attacked, and its members audaciou&s;ly in&s;ulted: To be &s;ilent would be criminal. It is the duty of every hone&s;t man to &s;trip de&s;igning hypocri&s;y of its ma&s;k, and point out tho&s;e who in reality are forging chains for their fellow-&s;ubjects. And as I am thus dragged into this conte&s;t, whatever bad con&s;equen|ces may attend it, will be chargeable on tho&s;e, and tho&s;e only, who began it; and will not &s;uffer other to live in peace.</P>
<P>Perhaps my readers may think that I have taken &s;ufficient notice of No. I. of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> already,&mdash;that a thing &s;o frothy, &s;o malicious, and de&s;titute of argument, de|&s;erves
<PB N="53" REF="010857_0027_0F8524F1FAAEA4E0">not any further animadver&s;ion. I confe&s;s this to be true in a great mea&s;ure; and no per&s;on can be influenced by that pa|per either again&s;t the <HI>appeal,</HI> or the cau&s;e in defence of which it was written, unle&s;s he gives up the exerci&s;e of his judgment, (if he has any) and becomes a mere dupe to prejudice and party.</P>
<P>However a fool mu&s;t &s;ometimes be an&s;wered according to his folly, le&s;t he &s;hould be wi&s;e in his own conceit, and lead others into the &s;ame predicament with him&s;elf. No doubt the author of this piece is the very hero of the cau&s;e,&mdash;the chief engineer, &mdash;the <HI>conductor-generalis</HI> of the intended operations again&s;t the <HI>appeal,</HI> the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> Accordingly he &s;teps forth the mo&s;t forward of the faction, and like him in the Go&s;pel, he gives them their name, and like him al&s;o he might &s;ay, <HI>we are many.</HI> It will not be improper therefore to examine a little fur|ther into the merits of this production, by which we may form an e&s;timate of the author's de&s;igns, as well as of the cau&s;e in which he is embarked.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall not again repeat his egregious Blunder men|tioned in my la&s;t; of which that waggi&s;h companion, and very good friend of mine, <HI>Jack Punlove,</HI> &s;aid&mdash;<Q>It was a Bull, begot by a Bear, on a Sheep and a Wolf.</Q> Depend upon it, courteous reader, I &s;hall not be &s;o prolix in my exercitations on any of his future productions, unle&s;s he &s;hould throw &s;ome Argu|ment or matter in my way that will be worthy of it. As for the two next, low, creeping Whigs,&mdash;without life, or &s;pirit, or truth, or argument in them: A la&s;h at the cart's tail will be enough for them. Nay, half a dozen &s;uch may be di&s;patched in one an&s;wer; ju&s;t as a careful cook would tru&s;s up two or three brace of <HI>Snipes</HI> on one and the &s;ame &s;pit. Proceed we then to our fir&s;t <HI>Whig.</HI></P>
<P>He in&s;inuates&mdash; <Q>that encroachments have been lately made on our civil liberties; and that we can &s;carce obtain redre&s;s a|gain&s;t one injurious project, but another is forming again&s;t us.</Q> If this be the ca&s;e, why does he not exert him&s;elf in be|half of his country? What has <HI>he,</HI> or any one member of the faction, written, or otherwi&s;e done, to avert the&s;e impending mi&s;chiefs?&mdash;Nothing at all. He either throws out this in&s;inu|ation, and yet believes it to be fal&s;e; or el&s;e he remains an idle, inactive &s;pectator of our danger. In&s;tead of promoting that union among our&s;elves which he &s;ays is "peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary" at this time: He is doing all he can to divide and di&s;tract us,&mdash; to fill <HI>tho&s;e</HI> with groundle&s;s prejudices, with mutual hatred again&s;t each other, who &s;hould unite to carry on any &s;alutary &s;cheme for the public welfare; and I believe would willingly do &s;o, were it not for &s;uch re&s;tle&s;s incendiaries as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Several Gentlemen in <HI>America,</HI> when they apprehended the
<PB N="54" REF="010857_0028_0F8524F2732644D0">liberties of their country were injured, engaged with a generous and noble &s;pirit in the vindication of them. The author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations on the propriety of impo&s;ing taxes in the Briti&s;h colo|nies</HI> the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania Farmer,</HI> and others I could mention, are &s;triking in&s;tances of this. The&s;e worthy patriots, di&s;intere&s;ted in their views, and regardle&s;s of the dirty, &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ign of any particular party, inli&s;ted in the cau&s;e of freedom, and acquitted them&s;elves with honour. Their aim was to unite their country|men, and animate them with the &s;pirit of liberty; yet &s;o as to in|&s;pire them with affection to the mother country, and &s;hew how much the intere&s;t of both depends on their harmony, and mutual adherence to the principles of our con&s;titution. This was acting the part of real patriots; for which the worthy authors are ju&s;tly entitled to the hearty thanks of every friend to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>How different the conduct of our <HI>American Whig!</HI> How per|fect a contract to the&s;e in every re&s;pect does he exhibit! Inflamed with party rage, actuated by low, &s;elfi&s;h motives, and goaded on by malice: He pours out a torrent of &s;lander again&s;t a number of innocent, inoffen&s;ive, u&s;eful men, who are warm friends to liber|ty, and enemies to &s;lavery-of every kind; and thro' them &s;trikes at the <HI>Church</HI> for the blow is levelled at the <HI>Church</HI> in general, (as I &s;hall fully evince in the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;peculations,) and tends to promote univer&s;al di&s;cord throughout the continent.</P>
<P>And what was the mighty crime of which the members of the <HI>Church</HI> were guilty, to draw down his heavy di&s;plea&s;ure on them? Why truly they had the pre&s;umption to apply for an indulgence which every denomination in <HI>America</HI> enjoys,&mdash;an indulgence which they neither intend &s;hould interfere, nor po&s;&s;ibly can inter|fere with the rights or liberties, civil or religious, of any Chri&s;ti|ans whatever; and have appealed to the world, in the mo&s;t mo|derate, decent manner, for the rea&s;onablene&s;s and equity of their claim. This is the &s;um total of their offence.</P>
<P>This poor gentleman, however, is plea&s;ed to be in a violent rage,&mdash;&s;o violent that if his nerves are weak, it may be at|tended with fatal con&s;equences. This exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t charitably think, is what betrays him into the ab&s;urdities and contradictions which are to be found in every part of his piece. The Chri&s;tian reader, I am per&s;uaded, has more humanity than to expect I would be at the drudgery of enumerating and ani|madverting on all the&s;e. I will ju&s;t point out a few of them, which indeed are not a third of what it contains. He tells us in one place, that the appeal is a trifling, <Q>flim&s;y piece, and the futility of its rea&s;oning</Q> &s;uch as can <Q>only impo&s;e on the weak and credulous:</Q> But in another place he &s;ays it is <Q>artfully calculated to introduce the mo&s;t fatal, tremendous

<P>Our <HI>Whig</HI> &s;ays that Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> has exhibitted <Q>a new &s;pe|cies of Logic, by infering that if his appeal remained unan|&s;wered, all the world mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to acquie&s;ce in his propo&s;al.</Q> Now if the Dr. had &s;aid &s;o, it would be no un|rea&s;onable Inference, con&s;idering the complexion of his pre&s;ent antagoni&s;t, and of many others of the &s;ame &s;tamp around him. Why <HI>Bellarmine</HI> was introduced on the occa&s;ion, no mortal can tell; his ca&s;e having no re&s;emblance to that of the Dr. and therefore quite impertinent.</P>
<P>To be even with Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> the <HI>Whig</HI> has enriched our rhetoric with &s;everal &s;amples of new and rare wit. Take one in&s;tance in what follows. The <HI>appeal</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>congratulates po&s;terity, if not on the hopes of re&s;cuing them from purga|tory, at lea&s;t on the pro&s;pect of &s;peedily introducing a kind of millennial &s;tate by the <HI>epi&s;copal tripple</HI> di&s;charge of ordination, confirmation and government.</Q> I dare &s;ay there is abundance of wit here, if any per&s;on living could be &s;agacious enough to find out whereabouts it lies. This unu&s;ual turn in thought and expre&s;&s;ion, which is entirely out of the way of common &s;en&s;e, and makes people &s;tare and wonder what he would be at, is what di&s;tingui&s;hes a <HI>great</HI> genius, and advances him to a chief &s;eat among your <HI>profound</HI> authors. And this writer deals &s;o much in tropes and figures, in the application of which he is peculiarly happy, that he may vie with the famous <HI>Hudibras</HI> him&s;elf, of whom it is recorded&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>For Rhetoric, he could not ope</L>
<L>His Mouth, but out there flew a Trope.</L></Q>
<P>And here I join the <HI>appeal</HI> in felicitating po&s;terity on the many Improvements in genuine wit, without any allay of dulne&s;s, &mdash;in candid, fair rea&s;oning, without any mixture of &s;ophi&s;try, or prevarication, they are likely to reap from this gentleman's labours. From &s;uch ominious beginnings, what may we not expect!</P>

Upon the whole&mdash;our <HI>Whig,</HI> from his fir&s;t performance, appears to be better calculated for acting the part of a ludicrous buffoon, than a cool rea&s;oner&mdash;to injure a good cau&s;e, if he had one, than &s;erve it,&mdash;kindle, than extingui&s;h the flames of di&s;cord, &mdash;to ob&s;cure, than elucidate truth.

<BIBL><HI>THOMSON.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEVER had a nation &s;uch a pro&s;pect as Britain of erecting a va&s;t and durable empire: Con&s;ider the origin of the Per&s;ians and Medes, Babylonians and Egyptians, Mace|donians and Romans; hemmed in on every &s;ide, and acce&s;&s;ible to their neighbours, they could add nothing to their extent, but at the expence of a war. Every expan&s;ion depended upon con|que&s;t; &s;ituated as they were, the enlargement of the empire, was it&s;elf the cau&s;e of its fall: When the energy of the govern|ment could pu&s;h its force no farther, a mortifying reflux en&s;ued, and the victors in their turn were repelled and overwhelmed by ho&s;ts from di&s;tant countries, which their arms were unable to reach. How inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;uperior the advantages of Great-Bri|tain, with the help of her American dominions! For territory, we need not quarrel with any power upon earth. This indi&s;|pen&s;ible &s;ub&s;tratum of empire we are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; we have a country amply &s;ufficient for hundreds of millions, and can &s;pread out an inheritance from ocean to ocean, at a mode|rate expence of money, and without the guilty effu&s;ion of human blood.</P>
<P>The benefits we enjoy from our &s;ituation, our climates, and the fecundity of the &s;oil, are numberle&s;s, and not to be recounted. No quarter of the globe can boa&s;t a preheminence: No nation in &s;ome re&s;pects pretend to an equality: On one &s;ide acce&s;&s;ible to the ocean for all the purpo&s;es of commerce, on neither expo&s;ed to any dangerous vicinity, and from all foreign force that can e&s;&s;entially di&s;turb our repo&s;e too far removed. Never was there &s;uch a <HI>Phoenix &s;tate.</HI> What le&s;s than the power of the Almighty, with the &s;tart we have gained, can prevent our arrival to the highe&s;t elevation of grandeur and opulence?</P>
<P>Courage, then Americans! liberty, religion, and &s;ciences are on the wing to the&s;e &s;hores: The finger of God points out a mighty empire to your &s;ons: The &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s were never expelled to make room in this, the be&s;t part of the conti|nent, for idolaters and &s;laves. The land we po&s;&s;e&s;s is the gift of heaven to our fathers, and divine providence, &s;eems to have de|creed it to our late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="010857_0030_0F8524F3E4E32938">
So legible this munificent and cele&s;tial deed, in the events that are pa&s;&s;ed, that we need not be di&s;couraged by the bickerings at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, between us and our parent country. The an|gry cloud, rai&s;ed by the ra&s;hne&s;s, and &s;upported by the ob&s;tinacy of a man, in whom oppo&s;ition and di&s;appointment, have begot in|flexible malice again&s;t the colonies, will &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated. Bri|tain has only to learn our importance to her own intere&s;t, and this once under&s;tood, the enemies of both countries will in&s;tantly be put to &s;ilence; and America advance to felicity and glory, with redoubled rapidity and vigour.</P>
<P>Grant it to be fact (and &s;ure 'tis a truth too palpable to be de|nied) that a <HI>third part</HI> of the commerce of the nation depends upon the colonies; I &s;ay, if this propo&s;ition be true, we may wind up our hopes to all the confidence of a&s;&s;urance, that Great-Britain will never &s;uffer this cord to be cut, by which we are &s;o intimately united. And this cord uncut, it requires no depth of policy to fore|&s;ee, that we &s;hall one day or other, draw every thing valuable at home (the Terra firma of tho&s;e i&s;lands only excepted) into the &s;pa|cious bo&s;om of the continent of America. Nor need this pro&s;pect give either of us an alarm. Happy for her, that &s;he has an a&s;y|lum prepared again&s;t the day of her calamity. Happy for us, the work is &s;o far advanced, that there is no looking back. Thrice happy for us both, that the mother and her &s;ons will again be col|lected into one hou&s;e, and that in proportion to the abatement of the national glory in Europe, will be the brightne&s;s of its re&s;urrec|tion in America.</P>
<P>The day dawns in which the foundation of this mighty empire is to be laid, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>regular American con&s;titu|tion.</HI> All that has hitherto been done, &s;eems to be little be&s;ide the collection of materials, for the con&s;truction of this glorious fa|brick. 'Tis time to put them together. The transfer of the Euro|pean part of the great family is &s;o &s;wift, and our growth &s;o va&s;t, that, before &s;even years roll over our heads, the fir&s;t &s;tone mu&s;t be laid.&mdash;Peace or war; famine or plenty; poverty or affluence; in a word no circum&s;tance, whether pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, can happen to our parent; nay, no conduct of hers, whether wi&s;e or imprudent, no po&s;&s;ible temper on her part, whether kind or cro&s;s grained, will put a &s;top to this building. There is no contending with Omnipotence, and the <HI>predi&s;po&s;itions</HI> are &s;o numerous, and &s;o well adapted to the ri&s;e of America, that our &s;ucce&s;s is indu|bitable; and Britain, who began the work, will not, cannot, with-hold her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Her a&s;&s;i&s;tance did I &s;ay; She will &s;pend all that &s;he has.&mdash;nay, &s;he is coming, fa&s;t coming, in her own pro|per per&s;on, and will de&s;ert her beloved i&s;land, to complete the &s;tupendous and la&s;ting monument of her power. What an aera is this to America! and how loud the call to vigilance and acti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y! As we conduct, &s;o will it fare with us and our children.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="010857_0030_0F8524F3E4E32938">
In &s;ome future paper I &s;hall dilate this idea, and attempt to point to the proper objects of our attention, that are of civil con|cern; but the remainder of this day's lucubration, is intended to guard again&s;t the undue influence of our clergy, while we are moulding the great political ma&s;s into order.</P>
<P>Every eye &s;hould be open at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on as the pre&s;ent. No man reveres this nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful part of the community, more than I do, I don't mean, therefore, to take an occa&s;ion, with Dei&s;ts and Libertines, for licentious aba&s;e. Rancour again&s;t the ble&s;|&s;ed author of our mo&s;t holy religion, is the common motives of the &s;currilities uttered again&s;t the mini&s;ters of his go&s;pel. But it is ne|verthele&s;s our duty; nay, our regard to the clergy, demands the utmo&s;t attention, to the efforts they are con&s;tantly inclined to make, in favour of them&s;elves. As a learned and &s;peculative body, they po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>knowledge,</HI> one of the mo&s;t fruitful &s;ources of power, and in &s;pite of all the mortifying le&s;&s;ons, taught by their divine ma&s;ter, the leaven of pride and ambition works night and day, to acquire dominion; which as often as they have &s;ucceeded, proved to be beyond all others relentle&s;s and intolerable.</P>
<P>It is &s;toried in their own hi&s;tory, that when the Emperor Con|&s;tantine endowed the church with lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the voice of an Angel was heard in the air, crying, <HI>Hodie venenum infun|ditur in eccle&s;iam. This day poi&s;on is poured into the church:</HI> and bitter experience has confirmed the truth of the&s;e words, whate|ver we believe concerning the being by whom they were uttered. Of this execrable potion, the bi&s;hop of Rome took the fir&s;t draught; and all Chri&s;tendom furni&s;hes in&s;tances of prie&s;ts who long to tip|ple this <HI>wine of fornication,</HI> Our wi&s;e and pious reformers began therefore with ab&s;olutely renouncing the cup, and 'tis too, too evident, that in &s;pite of the admonitions of prophecy, the prin|ciples of &s;ound policy, and the experience of every age &s;ince this de&s;tructive bowl was &s;tirred up, in which &s;piritual gifts and worldly benefits, are ab&s;urdly compounded together, that &s;ome of the prote&s;tant clergy are as de&s;irous to take the intoxicating &s;ip, as tho&s;e, who with the <HI>&s;carlet whore,</HI> have often got drunk, and <HI>defiled the nations.</HI></P>
<P>To this I impute all the prayers, entreaties, conjurations, &s;ighs, and lamentations, of a certain cla&s;s of prie&s;ts, for the introduction of a <HI>&s;piritual Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> into this country. I am &s;en&s;ible that they di&s;avow all noxious de&s;igns, and that like other &s;ots they palliate their inordinate thir&s;t after the in&s;alutary do&s;e, by preten|ces that &s;eem friendly to health and con&s;i&s;tent with &s;obriety and innocence. But as all attempts from an order, who abjure the roughne&s;s of violence, will be dictated by <HI>the wi&s;dom of the &s;er|pent,</HI> and cunningly affect the <HI>harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the dove;</HI> we ought, for preventing the &s;ucce&s;s of their machinations, to &s;et a double
<PB N="60" REF="010857_0031_0F8524F4A3E51258">guard upon our privileges. Of all thraldom, &s;piritual thraldom is the wor&s;t; and if ever any &s;ect acquires a dominion in this country, the fires of per&s;ecution mu&s;t burn with hotter vengeance <HI>here,</HI> than in any other part of the world; becau&s;e our nume|rous per&s;ua&s;ions afford the mo&s;t plentiful fuel. Cowards are mali|cious, and the fears of the a&s;&s;uming denomination will never be quieted till the throne they erect is free from all danger. Which of our numerous per&s;ua&s;ions bids faire&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o lord it over the re&s;t, I have &s;hewn in &s;ome former papers; and for that very rea&s;on, they of all others, ought to be content with their lot. Guaran|tied on every &s;ide again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, what have Epi&s;copalians to fear? In the di&s;tribution of power they have &s;o immoderate a &s;hare, that the very de&s;ire to have more, is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with all Chri&s;tian moderation, but gives ju&s;t grounds for &s;u&s;picion that they are meditating an <HI>offen&s;ive war.</HI></P>
<P>But con&s;cience is pleaded&mdash;For what? that the church, &s;ays Dr. Chandler, may be better governed.&mdash;Over whom is this go|vernment to be exerci&s;ed?&mdash;Not, &s;ays he, over the laity, (a &s;ure proof this, that the government de&s;ired, is not deduced from the &s;criptures) but only over the clergy.&mdash;Let them behave better. This is in their own power, and if any remain incorrigible, my Lord of Landaff, and the re&s;t of the &s;ociety at home, upon pro|per complaint, (which complaint every man is invited to make) will &s;oon bring the delinquents to rea&s;on. As to the matter of ordinati|on, the candidate's con&s;cience is relieveable by a trip to London; nor need the laity be afflicted, if he makes any difficulty; for tho&s;e mu&s;t be &s;mall motions of the &s;pirit indeed, towards the work of the mini&s;try, which the &s;ight of &s;alt water will &s;ubdue.&mdash;And with re&s;pect to confirmation, &s;ince we have &s;o long been without it, and no man is &s;o &s;hamele&s;sly uncharitable, as to &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;alvation, and that our ance&s;tors have all peri&s;hed for want of it, the con&s;cience bound on account of this defect, can be on no very pitiable rack of pain. Be&s;ides, what is mo&s;t fatal to this plea, is, that the majority of the continent have con&s;ciences too, and by tho&s;e very con&s;ciences, think them&s;elves bound to op|po&s;e the un&s;ea&s;onable introduction of proud prelates into this coun|try.&mdash;That it is a fact, that thou&s;ands have horrors at the bare pro&s;pect, the Doctor can want no proof at this day; and if the minority have &s;uch uncon&s;cionable con&s;ciences, as not to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls in patience,</HI> till God, in his wi&s;e providence, and for the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins, opens a wider door for the&s;e right re|verend fathers, and their lay and clerical officers and attendants, they can have no Chri&s;tian con&s;ciences at all.</P>
<P>But the Doctor tells us, that our fears are groundle&s;s, and that the bi&s;hop he wants, is a <HI>primitive bi&s;hop.</HI>&mdash;This, good ma&s;ter ap|pellant, is at pre&s;ent a very &s;carce commodity; and you would
<PB N="61" REF="010857_0031_0F8524F4A3E51258">your&s;elf laugh at the wide-mouthed credulity, that can &s;wallow &s;uch a camel. Are they wanted for patterns of imitation?&mdash; The Doctor has not &s;aid &s;uch a word.&mdash;For their prayers and their &s;ermons?&mdash;No one a&s;&s;erts it. But to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all that are acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the church, they are &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>protection and defence.</HI>&mdash;Would not any &s;tranger be led by this, to believe, that the mi&s;&s;ionaries were per|&s;ecuted; And yet not a man of them all&mdash;no, not the meane&s;t mi&s;&s;ionary upon the continent, would exchange the &s;ociety's bounty, for the revenues and rank of a primitive bi&s;hop. The apo&s;tles, to begin with the fir&s;t bi&s;hops, we know lived by charity, and the labour of their hands.&mdash;For three centuries after, they were main|tained by private helps, and the pay of their &s;cholars.&mdash;The&s;e were the times in which the clergy <HI>re&s;i&s;ted unto blood,</HI> and by the way, the good reputation of our American clergy, is greatly owing to the nece&s;&s;ity they are under, of living near the&s;e glorious examples. Antiently a bi&s;hop's palace was a cottage; for the fourth council of Carthage, about the year 350, laid it down as a canon or law, that the bi&s;hop &s;hould live near his church, in <HI>Ho&s;pitiolo,</HI> that is, in a <HI>little cottage.</HI> In the excerptions of <HI>Eg|bert,</HI> archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> &s;o late as the year 750, the &s;ame canon was renewed.&mdash;<HI>Bede</HI> tells us, that their very cathedrals were built of wattle and boards pieced together, and covered with reed.&mdash;The table of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> a bi&s;hop of the highe&s;t renown, as <HI>Po&s;&s;edonius</HI> relates, was &s;pread with di&s;hes and trenchers of wood, his hou&s;e was mean, he &s;eldom had any fle&s;h to eat, and his whole &s;ervice of plate con&s;i&s;ted of half a dozen &s;poons.&mdash;<HI>Spiridion</HI> tended a flock of &s;heep. St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> one of the mo&s;t learned of the fathers, tho' no bi&s;hop, dwelt like them, <HI>in pauperi tuguriolo,</HI> a <HI>poor little cottage;</HI> and Ambro&s;e, the bi&s;hop of Milan, turns the tables upon the pampered prie&s;ts of the Gentiles, by boa&s;ting in his maxim, that <HI>the poverty of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, was an honour to them, Glorio&s;a in &s;acerdotibus domini, paupertas.</HI> The&s;e are the bi&s;hops &s;ome men pretend to de&s;ire. How much more credible, that in|&s;tead of being a bulwark to the mi&s;&s;ionaries, unle&s;s by their pray|ers, &s;uch bi&s;hops as tho&s;e would be a tax upon their charity, not to mention the probability that lives &s;o <HI>apo&s;tolically</HI> &s;piritual, and abject, would render them, if not &s;ubjects of per&s;ecution, at lea&s;t objects of contempt.</P>
<P>If by primitive bi&s;hops, they mean not &s;uch poor mi&s;erable bi|&s;hops as the&s;e, it remains to give <HI>this equivocal expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;ome determinate meaning, and till then the treaty between Dr. Chand|ler and the public, may doubtle&s;s remain unratified, without any impeachment of the honour and ju&s;tice of North-America, which this writer has unwarily drawn into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We &s;hould e&s;tem it the palladium of our liberties, if the King's
<PB N="62" REF="010857_0032_0F8524F570561D70">judges held their commi&s;&s;ions by the tenure of good behaviour; and to the pre&s;ervation of the morals of our clergy, it is e&s;&s;ential that their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depend upon the &s;ame honourable condition. A bi&s;hop and his officers, independent of the people!&mdash;I tremble at the thought of &s;uch a powerful &s;py, in a country ju&s;t forming a &s;tate of &s;oundne&s;s and &s;tability&mdash;Rou&s;e then, Americans! You have as much to fear from &s;uch a mini&s;ter of the Church, as you had lately from a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, and whether this project is not a device of the latter, by dividing us to favour his de&s;igns, tho' he is now in di&s;grace, is &s;ubmitted to your wi&s;dom, to di&s;cern and prevent.</P>

<P>THE author of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> was confident from the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, that he &s;hould &s;oon drive his adver&s;a|rives out of the fair field of battle, and reduce them to vent their di&s;appointed malice, in the impotent ammunition of &s;candal and mi&s;repre&s;entation; but he did not flatter him&s;elf, that they would &s;neak behind their intrenchments &s;o early, as he finds by the let|ter in Holt's la&s;t paper, &s;igned, <HI>a Son of Liberty.</HI> Could that artle&s;s Tory have given any better proof of his regard to the thing, than by the unwarrantable liberty he has taken of counterfeiting the name, he would in&s;tead of cen&s;uring, have applauded the de|fence of the religious liberties of his country. My paper for this day, which was in the hands of the Printer before his letter came out, is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient refutation of the in&s;inuations of this &s;crib|bler. If the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of an American Epi&s;copate is at this junc|ture un&s;ea&s;onable, why, but becau&s;e he was a zealot for the per|nicious project I oppo&s;e, and am determined with thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of Americans to oppo&s;e, did not he point his little pi&s;tol (as in ju&s;tice he ought to have done) at the original aggre&s;|&s;or? or can he be ignorant that Doctor Chandler unma&s;ked his battery, and began his a&s;&s;ault &s;o long ago as la&s;t autumn? Having thus detected a foe, under the cloak of a Son of Liberty, let the public beware of every writer, who while he affects a zeal for our civil liberties, will not declare his abhorrence of eccle&s;ia&s;tical ty|ranny, which is by &s;o much wor&s;e than every other &s;pecies of tyran|ny, as our religious, are preferable to our temporal intere&s;ts. The virtuous &s;on of liberty will vindicate both; and I doubt not that in a few months more, the whole continent will agree, that he who contends only for the one, is not entitled to either.</P>

<P>AS the propo&s;al of introducing Dioce&s;an bi&s;hops into Briti&s;h America is an innovation, which would probably affect the religious and civil liberties of his Maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects, I &s;hall not be terrified from offering my objections, meerly becau&s;e Doctor Chandler has been plea&s;ed to call it per&s;ecution. Appeal, page 82. The good gentleman knows that all the rejecters of epi&s;copacy have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of liberty, and that their principles of church government are principles of freedom. He ought not therefore to think it per&s;ecution, if they, jealous of their liberty, &s;hould oppo&s;e this dangerous innovation; the very mention of which recalls to our minds the unrelenting rigors of epi&s;copal tyranny; the heavy fines, impri&s;onments, and per&s;ecutions which peopled the &s;avage wilds of America; and forced many thou&s;ands of our forefathers to &s;eek a peaceful re|treat, from the cruelty of their fellow-Chri&s;tians, among&s;t more ho&s;pitable Indians. The&s;e refugees have not yet forgot the groans and blood of the many myriads of oppre&s;&s;ed Puritans, which cry beneath the altar "how long O Lord"! the li&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y thou&s;and per&s;ons that &s;uffered in England on a religious account, betwixt the re&s;toration and the revolution; nor the &s;evere penal|ties inflicted on them, for wor&s;hipping God according to their con|&s;ciences; by which they &s;uffered in their trade and e&s;tates near two millions in the compa&s;s of a few years. The&s;e in&s;tances of epi&s;copal tyranny, which &s;hould fill every reader with horror, ex|tort from the Doctor him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding his fondne&s;s for ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical power, the mode&s;t &s;oftened conce&s;&s;ion, <Q>that there have been formerly &s;ome in&s;tances wherein the power of our bi&s;hops has been &s;trained too high</Q> P 91. And le&s;t we &s;hould be led to imagine, that he, out of his abundant charity, had ac|knowledged too much again&s;t his church, he endeavours to wipe off the reproach from her, and ca&s;t it rather <Q>on the times, in which neither the natural rights of men, nor the religious rights of Chri&s;tians, were &s;o well under&s;tood, as in the pre&s;ent age. For even then," he &s;ays "the &s;pirit of the church of England, like that of the go&s;pel, was <HI>more peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated,</HI> than that of any other national church.</Q> This may &s;erve to give us &s;ome idea of the Doctor's comparatively peaceable and gentle &s;pirit. But I hope we &s;hall have a &s;till more peaceable and gentle &s;pirit to reign in America: Indeed he la|bours to per&s;uade us, that when his &s;o much wi&s;hed-for bi&s;hop comes, he will bring it with him, "for the times", he &s;ays, "are
<PB N="64" REF="010857_0033_0F8524F622000A60">much mended in this re&s;pect," P. 90&mdash;Excu&s;e us, good Sir, if we think, that however the &s;pirit of the times be much mended, the &s;pirit of your church and her bi&s;hops, is not yet &s;o much mended, as to free us entirely from any fears of oppre&s;&s;ion by their exten&s;ive powers.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the peaceable &s;pirit of the rulers of the church of England now, or in &s;ome following paper, I may have occa&s;ion to point out &s;ome things that do not &s;avour much of the &s;pirit of moderation and candour. However I would be under&s;tood thro' the whole, not to intend any reflection on the laity of that com|munion, nor on all the clergy. The moderation of &s;ome is well known: they have endeavoured with a truly Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, not only to bear a con&s;tant te&s;timony again&s;t the numberle&s;s abu&s;es, which have ari&s;en from the powers of the clergy, but are endea|vouring to bring about a reformation in many things, which they candidly acknowledge to &s;tand in need of it. Far be it from me to lay that to the charge of tho&s;e men, which they, as well as we, acknowledge to be unju&s;t and tyrannical. But there are others of a very different character and temper, e&s;pecially among the clergy, who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of high-church; and who according to Doctor Chandler, compo&s;e the body of that na|tional church, who have not as yet candour enough to admit of &s;uch a reformation. Page 96 and 97.</P>
<P>Although the wings of the&s;e high-flyers have been cropt, and their exhorbitant powers limitted in &s;ome degree, by the &s;alutary re&s;trants of &s;ome modern &s;tatutes; yet we know it was much again&s;t their wills, that &s;uch merciful laws were made. They mu&s;t therefore give the world &s;ome more &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of their peaceable forbearing temper, than their advocate Doctor Chandler's word, before we can believe, that the &s;pirit of per&s;e|cution is not yet alive in that Church, and would not flame out again in all its wonted rage, if they were but allowed to exerci&s;e the powers they claim.</P>
<P>Until that flagrant abu&s;e of the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, occa&s;ioned by the TEST Act, &s;hall be removed out of the churches of England and Ireland, we mu&s;t believe, good Doctor, that you not only <HI>would</HI> but <HI>do</HI> per&s;ecute your brethren, and cut them off from the natural rights of &s;erving their King and country, in all important places of power and tru&s;t; unle&s;s they can concur with you, not only in what they look on as a &s;uper&s;titious mode of admini&s;tering that divine ordinance; but al&s;o in pro&s;tituting that &s;acred rite to &s;ecular, nay to wor&s;e than &s;ecular purpo&s;es; by making that which was in&s;tituted as a te&s;t of our fidelity to the King of Kings, a te&s;t of our allegiance to our earthly &s;overeign. That this is per&s;ecution, the Doctor him&s;elf will help me to prove, page 82, <Q>To puni&s;h us for our religious principles when no rea|&s;ons
<PB N="65" REF="010857_0033_0F8524F622000A60">of &s;tate require it, is per&s;ecution in the &s;tricte&s;t and pro|pere&s;t &s;en&s;e. Whatever evil is inflicted on us, on account of our principles and practices, is properly puni&s;hment; and every good we are deprived of, is equal to an evil inflicted. As &s;uch treatment has the very e&s;&s;ence of per&s;ecution, &s;o it can have only its &s;ource in an intolerent per&s;ecuting di&s;po&s;ition.</Q> The &s;acramental te&s;t is therefore a &s;tanding monument of the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of the church of England; even in the judg|ment of Doctor Chandler, unle&s;s he be hardy enough to attempt a&s;&s;igning rea&s;ons of &s;tate to change that <Q>which has the nature of per&s;ecution, and ari&s;es from an intolerant &s;pirit,</Q> into a &s;alutary regulation. When he produces arguments to convince men, who are the lea&s;t conver&s;ant with the rights of men or Chri&s;tians, that it is rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;o large a body of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, as the rejecters of his beloved hier|archy in England and Ireland, who have always di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, for their loyalty and attachment to the pre&s;ent royal family, &s;hould have &s;uch an unheard of &s;tigma fixed upon them, that they are deprived of the common privileges of &s;ubjects; then, and not till then, will the Doctor be able to wipe away the re|proach from his church. But it is hoped, he will never &s;ubject his knowledge of the rights of mankind, nor his own Chri&s;tianity, to the &s;u&s;picions which mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch an attempt. The Doctor would indeed in &s;ome places appear charitable enough to allow, that they are as loyal and as good &s;ubjects, as the epi&s;copa|lians them&s;elves are, "There are," &s;ays he, <Q>many Briti&s;h &s;ubjects both at home and in the plantations, who reject epi&s;co|pacy, and yet are warm advocates for our happy civil con&s;ti|tution. It is therefore ra&s;h and injurious to charge any with di&s;affection to the government, at this day, becau&s;e they di&s;|&s;ent from the national religion.</Q> Page 115. Whether he means that of South or North-Britain, is not di&s;tingui&s;hed; but it is mo&s;t likely the former, as very few of his brethren the <HI>Di&s;&s;ent|ers in Scotland,</HI> are friends to the pre&s;ent government.</P>
<P>What rea&s;ons of &s;tate can there be alledged, why &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's loyal and faithful &s;ubjects, &s;hould be deprived of their natural and undoubted rights? Po&s;&s;ibly the Doctor's fertile imagination will furni&s;h us with &s;ome, which have hitherto lain hid from the penetration of men of inferior genius and invention. When he conde&s;cends to do this, and thereby attemps to wipe off the offence which his church continues to give by the profanation of the Lord's &s;upper and the denial of civil rights to as good &s;ub|jects, as tho&s;e who join her communion, it will be time enough for me to give them a thorough and impartial examination. But till this &s;hall be done, the good Doctor will not take it hard, that we fear the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution is &s;till alive in his church, and
<PB N="66" REF="010857_0034_0F8524F6EB64AC50">ready to operate, with its native violence, whenever an opportu|nity &s;hall offer. There is no way at pre&s;ent for the Doctor to evade the force of this argumentation, tran&s;cribed from his <HI>Ap|peal,</HI> unle&s;s he boldly cuts the knot, and a&s;&s;erts, that none who reject epi&s;copacy, have any natural right to civil or military offices. He has indeed &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion in page 109; but it betrays &s;uch an unacquaintedne&s;s with the rights of mankind, and &s;avours &s;o much of a per&s;ecuting di&s;po&s;ition, that charity would incline us to think it fell inadvertently from his pen, when he was &s;olacing him&s;elf with the glorious pro&s;pect of the clergy and the people of his church engro&s;&s;ing all honourable and profitable employments throughout the colonies. The Doctor &s;urely will not vindicate the expre&s;&s;ion, but from a regard to his character for <HI>moderation, candour, and catholici&s;m,</HI> retract it without delay.</P>
<P>But this is not our only rea&s;on for concluding that the &s;pirit of the Bi&s;hops, and inferior Clergy, (as they are called) is not like the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be in|treated. Nor is it owing to the gentle temper of the con&s;titution of their church, that the rejecters of epi&s;copacy are not treated as har&s;hly now as formerly. The <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> breathes a very cruel and &s;lavi&s;h &s;pirit. It enacts that <Q>whoever &s;hall de|clare, or &s;peak any thing in derogation, or depraving of the book of <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> or any thing therein contained, or any part thereof, he &s;hall, for the fir&s;t offence, &s;uffer impri&s;on|ment for one whole year, without bail or main-prize; and for the &s;econd offence be impri&s;oned during life.</Q> Weak mu&s;t the church have appeared, which &s;tood in need of &s;uch a &s;upport! But we are a&s;&s;ured by divine authority, that <Q>the gates of hell &s;hall never prevail againg the Church of Chri&s;t.</Q> This famous act however has been often called, and I doubt not Doctor Chand|ler him&s;elf has long e&s;teemed it a grand pillar of his church. But who envies him the honour of belonging to a church, that mu&s;t be &s;upported, if &s;upported at all, by &s;uch a notorious infringement of the rights of private judgment; &s;uch a prohibition of a fair and candid examination of her principles and di&s;cipline; and &s;uch a re&s;traint on the freedom of &s;peech, e&s;&s;ential to Briti&s;h liber|ty? Here I can &s;afely appeal to the impartial world, and even to the con&s;cience of the Doctor him&s;elf, whether this be not a very unju&s;t and per&s;ecuting law.</P>
<P>I might ea&s;ily proceed to &s;hew, that the <HI>Canons</HI> of the Doctor's church do not be&s;peak a very charitable temper; but this I &s;hall have more room to enlarge upon in &s;ome future paper.</P>

<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of a prote&s;tant epi&s;copate in America is al&s;o very zealou&s;ly contended for: And it is very alarming to a people who&s;e fathers, from the hard&s;hips they &s;uffered under &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, were obliged to fly their native country into a wilderne&s;s, in order peaceably to enjoy their privileges, civil and religious: Their being threatened with the lo&s;s of both at once, mu&s;t throw them into a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation. We hope in God &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment will never take place in Ame|rica, and we de&s;ire you would &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;e it. The reve|nue rai&s;ed in America for ought we can tell, may be as con&s;tituti|onally applied towards the &s;upport of prelacy as of &s;oldiers and pen&s;ioners: If the property of the &s;ubject is taken from him with|out his con&s;ent, it is immaterial, whether it be done by one man or five hundred; or whether it be applied for the &s;upport of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic or military power, or both.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING gently corrected the <HI>American Whig,</HI> for the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his Pen in his fir&s;t Rhap&s;ody, I &s;hall now proceed, in Cour&s;e, to animadvert upon No. II. of this weekly Effu&s;ion, <HI>alias, Introduction the Second by a different Hand,</HI> having taken it into my Head to be more liberal for this Time, than I intended, or &s;uch a Publication de&s;erves; refering tho&s;e who are de&s;irous to be informed wherein <HI>per&s;onal Identity</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, to a Chapter on that Subject in Mr. <HI>Look's E&s;&s;ay concerning human Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Whig</HI> introduces <HI>this</HI> Introduction with two &s;tiff clum&s;y Paragraphs upon the Subject of <HI>Liberty;</HI> the whole Meaning of which, &s;o far as they have any Meaning, may be much more clearly and fully expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e two &s;hort Sentences, reduced to plain Engli&s;h: <Q>Liberty is a very good thing.&mdash;
<PB N="68" REF="010857_0035_0F8524F7A6E9CAC0">and Men ought to be careful to pre&s;erve &s;o good a Thing as Liberty.</Q> I dare &s;ay he had not a &s;ingle Idea which is not fully expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e two Propo&s;itions. What Occa&s;ion then was there for all this round about pedantic Harangue, upon &s;o plain and familiar a Subject?</P>
<P>I am at a Lo&s;s to di&s;cover, what could have been the primary and immediate View of this Writer, in ob&s;curing the&s;e plain and hone&s;t Truths, by a Repre&s;entation of them through the mi&s;ty Medium of &s;uch <HI>Verbage;</HI> but <Q>without Breach of Charity, we may &s;uppo&s;e at lea&s;t a &s;econdary Motive,</Q> to have been, The giving to his Friends &s;ome Proof of his Zeal for the glorious Cau&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Liberty. And, &s;ince plau&s;ible Words are a much cheaper Commodity than commendable Actions, perhaps he had the farther Intention of reconmmending him&s;elf by a patriotic Example, in the&s;e Time of Oeconomy. Yet as to the Character he <HI>a&s;&s;umes</HI> of a zealous Advocate for Liberty, it appears to be forced and unnatural; and, with all his Study to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf, he makes but an awkward Figure, and hobbles abominably. For, to &s;ay nothing here of his general De&s;ign, which is unfriendly to the Cau&s;e of Liberty, as he aims con|fining it to his own Party to the exclu&s;ion of others, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;uffered an expre&s;&s;ion to drop from his Pen, which betrays the mo&s;t di&s;honourable and &s;ordid Conceptions,&mdash;and proves that he is a Stranger to the Charms of this amiable Godde&s;s. Other Writers, when they enter upon the Subject of Liberty, are im|mediately animated: But this Writer &s;hews, that he has no Acquaintance with this &s;overeign Beauty, by the In&s;en&s;ibility of his Deportment. El&s;e why &s;uch Rudene&s;s and want of Re&s;pect? Why does he attempt to pu&s;h her into the Rear of Life and Property?&mdash;telling us, with much Phlegm, that <Q><HI>next</HI> to Life and Property, Men will mo&s;t zealou&s;ly contend for its Pre&s;er|vation.</Q></P>
<P>Before he proceeds farther, I advi&s;e him, if he has any Regard for his own Reputation, or that of his Party, to make a Halt, and apply him&s;elf for a few Weeks, with the whole Force of his Abilities, to &s;tudy the Principles of true Liberty, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to under&s;tand the <HI>Elements</HI> of that noble Science. In the mean while, for his pre&s;ent U&s;e, I will lay before him a few Maxims relating thereto, which are inconte&s;table. Every &s;incere Friend of Liberty, is impartial in his E&s;teem for it, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hes it an univer&s;al Dominion. He that wi&s;hes Liberty uni|ver&s;ally to prevail, will endeavour to promote it in all Ca&s;es, with|out. Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons. He that endeavours to promotes it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Ca&s;es will be careful not to oppo&s;e it in any. Until he makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;elf a Ma&s;ter of the&s;e Principles, he will be only able, with his utmo&s;t Application, <Q><HI>&s;o</HI> naturally to counterfeit the Voice of <HI>Liberty,</HI> that it is not every Reader who will be able to
<PB N="69" REF="010857_0035_0F8524F7A6E9CAC0">di&s;criminate it from that of</Q>&mdash;<HI>Tyranny,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI> By way of Po&s;t&s;cript to what I have &s;aid on this Head, I will take the <HI>Liberty</HI> to inform him, that the Members of the Church of England, in reque&s;ting an American Epi&s;copate, aim at nothing more than the Enjoyment of that <HI>religious</HI> Liberty, which all other Denominations of Chri&s;tians throughout the Briti&s;h Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>In his <HI>third</HI> Paragraph, the <HI>American Whig</HI> goes on to apply his general Ob&s;ervations to a particular Ca&s;e. <Q>What led me into the&s;e Reflection, (&s;ays he) was the reading Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s Plea for an <HI>American Epi&s;copate.</HI></Q> His Reflections, we have &s;een, amount to two Propo&s;itions. The fir&s;t <Q>that Liberty is a very good Thing</Q>&mdash;was naturally enough &s;ugge&s;ted by the <HI>Appeal:</HI> But he blundered in the &s;econd. For in&s;tead of concluding <Q>that Men ought to be careful to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> &s;o good a Thing as Li|berty,</Q>&mdash;he ought more logically to have infered&mdash;<Q>that the Members of the CHURCH in <HI>America</HI> are right in &s;eeking to <HI>obtain</HI> &s;o good a Thing as Liberty,</Q>&mdash;and&mdash;<Q>that no true Friends of Liberty will ever oppo&s;e them.</Q> And in this Train he might have gone on to a Number of Conclu&s;ions, which would have done infinitely more Honour to his Head, and his Heart.</P>
<P>But he tells us, <Q>the Scheme for &s;ending Bi&s;hops into the Colonies, has it &s;eems been long under Con&s;ideration. 'Tis above fifty Years &s;ince it was fir&s;t &s;tarted.</Q> This I believe, becau&s;e the Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI> has proved it. And mo&s;t People will think it is high Time that it &s;hould be <HI>more</HI> than con&s;idered; but I fancy the CHURCH may wait fifty Years longer, before &s;uch Friends of Liberty as this will <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to its being carried into Execution.</P>
<P><Q>We hear (&s;ays he) the Advocates for it, both here and in <HI>England,</HI> have &s;anguine Expectations of its &s;peedy Accompli&s;h|ment.</Q> Let us &s;ee whether he offers any Thing by way of Il|lu&s;tration or Proof of the&s;e "&s;anguine Expectations." What he &s;ays further on the &s;ubject is in the next Paragraph in the&s;e Words: <Q>It is now generally known that the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> have rejected the Propo&s;al. As they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the Sentiments of their royal Ma&s;ter, this mu&s;t be con&s;trued a Denial from the Throne.</Q> Now as this will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e of Illu&s;tration, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to have been intended as a Medium of Proof. And as good proof it is, as the <HI>Whig</HI> has hitherto given us Rea&s;on to expect. Superficial Readers may object again&s;t it, becau&s;e the Premi&s;es and Con|clu&s;ion &s;tand at rather two great a Di&s;tance from each other on his Paper; and becau&s;e he leaves them under &s;ome Uncertainty as to the proce&s;s&mdash;whether he means to prove the <HI>Expectations</HI> from the <HI>Rejection,</HI> or the <HI>Rejection</HI> from the <HI>Expectations.</HI> But

<P><HI>Whatever has been rejected by the Mini&s;try, and denied from the Throne, is likely to &s;ucceed: But, the Plan for American Bi&s;hops has been rejected by the Mini&s;try, and denied from the Throne:</HI> Ergo <HI>The Plan for American Bi&s;hops is likely to &s;ucceed,</HI> and, <Q>the Advocates for it have <HI>&s;anguine Expectations</HI> of its &s;peedy Accompli&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P>It is only allowing him his Principle in his <HI>Major</HI> Propo&s;ition, and his Fact in the Minor, and then the <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> he will claim in his own Right.</P>
<P>But to proceed, <Q>No le&s;s than <HI>&s;even</HI> Petitions, <HI>we are told,</HI> have been tran&s;mitted by a certain Convention.</Q> Undoubtedly the Number <HI>&s;even</HI> is of mo&s;t tremendous Import.

<P>But this is not all: The&s;e <HI>Seven</HI> Addre&s;&s;es repre&s;ent <Q>the deplorable Condition of an <HI>unmitred</HI> Church.</Q> It &s;eems then that all that is reque&s;ted is a few <HI>Mitres,</HI> which never did Harm in any Country. For as a late Writer well ob&s;erves, <Q>a Man bent upon Mi&s;chief, can do it as effectually with a Pumkin-Shell upon his Head, as with a Mitre,</Q> now as Mitres are not worn at this Day in <HI>England,</HI> it is probable that as many as are wanted, may be purcha&s;ed at &s;econd Hand; and in a little Time we may learn to make them in the Colonies, and, as this will be a new Manufacture, it will prove a public Benefit to our Country.</P>
<P>Again: Tho&s;e who &s;igned the Addre&s;&s;es, <Q>boa&s;t of their in+credible Numbers.</Q> This is a vague, indefinite Expre&s;&s;ion and I do not well under&s;tand it.

<PB N="71" REF="010857_0036_0F8524F92AA40018">the Rea&s;ons for his believing them to be <HI>near</HI> a Million.

<P>If the Members of the Convention boa&s;t of their <Q>di&s;tingui&s;hed and un&s;haken Loyalty,</Q> I know not who can gain&s;ay it. Nay, this Writer him&s;elf in his next Paragraph, te&s;tifies in Favour of their general Character, and &s;peaks of <Q>that Zeal for the Con&s;titution and the Government at Home, to which he (the Author of the <HI>Appeal</HI>) and his Brethren, avow &s;o warm an Attachment.</Q> If People have a Zeal for the Con&s;titution, either in Whole or in Part, may they not be allowed to declare it, on proper Occa&s;ions?

<P>As to the Addre&s;&s;es <Q>not &s;paring very injurious Reflec|tions upon the other Denominations, as &s;editious Incendiaries, and di&s;affected to the King and the Government;</Q> Several of the Per&s;ons who &s;igned the Addre&s;&s;es, tell me this is a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation; and we are a&s;&s;ured by the Secretary to the Con|vention <Q>that this A&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>American Whig</HI> is ab&s;olutely, utterly, and intirely fal&s;e and groundle&s;s.</Q> And he publick|ly calls upon him <Q>to produce the Authority upon which he has a&s;&s;erted &s;o infamous a Fal&s;ehood.</Q> Until therefore the <HI>Ameri|can Whig</HI> produces the Evidence which the Secretary to the Convention calls for, he mu&s;t be looked upon as the Father of this infamous Fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>I have frequently been <HI>&s;urpri&s;ed</HI> in the Cour&s;e of my Life, but never more &s;o, than on finding it a&s;&s;erted by this Writer with &s;o much Confidence, that <Q>it is now generally <HI>known,</HI> that the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> have rejected the Propo&s;al</Q> of an Ameri|can Epi&s;copate: And I have made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire of &s;everal Member of the Convention, with whom I am accquaint|ed, whether there was any <HI>Truth</HI> in the A&s;&s;ertion. They all, to a Man, agreed in affirming, that the Propo&s;al was &s;o far from having been rejected by the Mini&s;try, that it had never been made to them, to the be&s;t of their Knowledge. They al&s;o a&s;&s;ured me that they have not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of <Q>a Denial from the Throne,</Q>&mdash;and that the In&s;inuation that <Q>in An&s;wer to their Petitions, they have been ordered to be &s;ilent,</Q> is fal&s;e and &s;candalous. Now as the&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="72" REF="010857_0037_0F8524FA18583938">know as much of the Matter as any other Per&s;ons, and as they are generally e&s;teemed to be Men of Integrity and Veracity, I &s;hall rather take their Word for it, than that of an anonymous, a|bu&s;ive <HI>Incendiary.</HI></P>

<HEAD>[From Mr. Parker's New-York Gazette, April 18, 1768.] THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. VI.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Chandler's</HI> Appeal, begins with a denial of the validity of the ordination of all the prote&s;tant mini&s;ters in the world except tho&s;e of his own denomination. This to be &s;ure is no great recommendation of his project, to the people of a country, who, a few only excepted, are firm in the opinion he attacks. Had he proceeded to expre&s;s him&s;elf in the &s;pirit of his principles, the bulk of the reformed clergy, and ours among the re&s;t, would
<PB N="73" REF="010857_0037_0F8524FA18583938">have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en called non-commi&s;&s;ion <HI>laymen</HI> and <HI>mi&s;taken pretenders,</HI> or <HI>egregious impo&s;tors.</HI> My next remarks therefore, upon the &s;ection intitled, a <HI>&s;ketch of the Arguments in favour of epi&s;copacy,</HI> are de&s;igned to guard his incautious, and le&s;s di&s;cerning readers, again&s;t too great a confidence in the &s;eeming &s;implicity of an addre&s;s calculated to cajole us int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a voluntary con&s;ent to the &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing a proud hierarchy on this continent.</P>
<P>It is far from my intention, where the Doctor delivers him&s;elf with the benevolence of a Chri&s;tian, or the candour of a gentleman, to excite cen&s;orious and ill grounded jealou&s;ies. I mean only to expo&s;e artful di&s;gui&s;es, contrived to conceal the true &s;pirit of the Appeal, and an in&s;idious affectation of courte&s;y, the better to promote a pernicious de&s;ign. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> with the generous in|dignation of a friend to truth, &s;ome where declares, that the man who wilfully connects ideas to terms, foreign to their ordi|nary &s;en&s;e, de&s;erves the puni&s;hment of him who &s;tops the con|duits of water to a city. And a much greater authority com|mends <HI>the I&s;raelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</HI> A profe&s;|&s;ed addre&s;s therefore to all ranks of people, upon a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t importance to their liberties and intere&s;ts, &s;hould not only be free from <HI>the entangling weeds of chicanery,</HI> but dictated with a contempt of the re&s;erves forbidden by an hone&s;t open-hearted &s;incerity.</P>
<P>After a&s;&s;erting the po&s;ition, that bi&s;hops are <HI>jure divino</HI> above pre&s;byters; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other words, that they are &s;o by the Authority of Chri&s;t; the con&s;equence was plain from that premi&s;e, that all the non epi&s;copal churches had departed from the true &s;tandard of government, and were cen&s;urable as &s;chi&s;matical and erroneous. And whatever might be the effect, as to the project he was con|cerned to promote, I appeal to the reader, whether it would not have done honour to the Doctor's &s;incerity, to have applied his te|net to the American churches with <HI>apo&s;tolic plainne&s;s of &s;peech?</HI> In&s;tead of &s;o commendable and courageous a conduct, we are fir&s;t told, that none not ordained by a bi&s;hop can officiate as clergy|men; and then follows the mincing conclu&s;ion, that every other ordination is e&s;teemed <HI>to be at lea&s;t irregular and defective.</HI> Would not every man imagine from the&s;e &s;oft words, that tho' the writer conceived other ordinations to be, when &s;trictly ex|amined, not preci&s;ely regular, yet that they might neverthele&s;s pa&s;s mu&s;ter, and the main end be an&s;wered? But no two points of the compa&s;s are more directly oppo&s;ed to each other, than &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition to the Doctor's true and real &s;entiments. The rea&s;on is apparent; at pre&s;ent the church he belongs to, is &s;uppo&s;ed, with the woman in the vi&s;ion, to be in a &s;tate of per&s;ecution; per&s;ecuted for the want of wealth, pomp and power; per&s;ecuted as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter, for the want of wealth, pomp and power
<PB N="74" REF="010857_0038_0F8524FAC6E532A0">to enable her to per&s;ecute others. Without the concurrence of the di&s;&s;enters tho&s;e benefits it &s;eems, are not to be expected. In this &s;tate a little velvet-mouthed delicacy was thought to be rea&s;onable and prudent: 'Tis therefore to carnal policy, and not to Chri&s;tian moderation, this tenderne&s;s is to be truly a&s;cribed. The Doctor's creed unchurches all the churches on the continent, except his own, and the church of Quebec. According to that, not one of the mini&s;ters of other denominations, are &s;ent out by Chri&s;t to promulge his go&s;pel; and let my lords the bi&s;hops be once landed and fortified in their palaces, guarded by their de|pendents, and &s;upported by their courts, and in&s;tead of this coaxing and trimming, we &s;hall &s;oon hear the thunder of excom|munication uttered with all the confidence and pride of &s;ecurity. The &s;oft bleatings of the lamb, will be changed into the terrible howling of the wolf; and every poor par&s;on who&s;e head never felt the weight of a bi&s;hop's hand, will &s;oon know the power of his pa&s;toral &s;taff, and the arm of the magi&s;trate into the bargain.</P>
<P>If any man doubts my prediction, and fondly pre&s;umes upon the charitable indulgence of eccle&s;ia&s;tical clemency, after it is ex|alted to the power of applying puni&s;hments at will and plea&s;ure, which mu&s;t inevitably be the ca&s;e, upon the introduction of &s;piritu|al lords into a country where they will find no lay-men for their match, let him learn wi&s;dom from hi&s;tory. Without the knowledge of mankind, it is impo&s;&s;ible to govern them well. This nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hment &s;eldom falls to the lot of &s;peculative mortals immured in a &s;tudy. Hence their conceit, contraction, and ob&s;tinacy. Give the reins to one of the&s;e book-worms, and he will attempt to drive the chariot of the &s;un: let him be an eccle&s;ia&s;tic be&s;ides, and impelled by the two irre&s;i&s;tible momentums of <HI>the glory of God and the &s;alvation of &s;ouls,</HI> and how can he refrain from adopting the Popi&s;h comment upon the text, <HI>compel them to come in!</HI> He will compel them with a witne&s;s. The dignity of the end ju&s;tifies all &s;orts of means. Mines and galleys, fire and faggot, pains and penalties, the rack and the cro&s;s, have all been applied in&s;tead of rea&s;on and argument; and thus man|kind will ever be pilaged and butchered, as often as they are &s;ubjected to the unbridled power of zealots, who as we &s;aid of archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> by the pride of a good con&s;cience, will be more ob&s;tinately in the wrong.</P>
<P>There can be no dependence for the continuation of our liber|ties, if ever a lordly clergyman is clothed with &s;ufficient power to put down all oppo&s;ers. Give him that, and his con&s;cience will &s;et it to work; nay, judging from experience, he will think him&s;elf con&s;cience-bound, by the &s;word of the &s;pirit, to brandi&s;h
<PB N="75" REF="010857_0038_0F8524FAC6E532A0">for our conviction, a &s;ort of weapons of a very different nature.</P>
<P>That the Doctor's principle leads to condemnation of all who deny it, none can di&s;pute; and however artful the terms in which it is conceived, I have &s;till &s;o high an opinion of his veracity, that I will ri&s;k the credit of the aforementioned pro|phecies, if he does not give an affirmative an&s;wer to the fol|lowing que&s;tion. It is this, and for the information of the &s;imple part of the tribunal he appeals to, I challenge a categorical reply to the interrogatory propo&s;ed, <HI>Whether he has not a better opinion of the validity of an ordination performed by the bi&s;hop of Rome, whom &s;ome Chri&s;tians &s;uppo&s;e to be the very &s;carlet whore mentioned by St. John, than of any one in which all the clergy of the nati|onal churches of Holland and Scotland, &s;hould concur?</HI></P>
<P>While this is preparing, or becau&s;e the Doctor may perhaps be di&s;inclined to have any corre&s;pondence with an American Whig, I will relieve the impatience of my readers by reminding them of two notable in&s;tances, which may help their conjectures con|cerning the an&s;wer reque&s;ted. It is not long &s;ince the Rev. <HI>Mon&s;. Haudin,</HI> took the pa&s;toral charge of the epi&s;copal church of Trenton, in New-Jer&s;ey, and afterwards that of New-Rochelle, <HI>without any re-ordination;</HI> but before Mr. <HI>Munro</HI> could be qualified to &s;erve the chapel of Philip&s;burgh, he was obliged to make a vi&s;it to the bi&s;hop of London, for his hand and his ble&s;|&s;ing. What other rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e differences, than that as this <HI>former,</HI> tho' a fugitive from Canada, had prie&s;tly orders from the Popi&s;h bi&s;hop of that country, his right to di&s;|pen&s;e the ordinances of the go&s;pel was inconte&s;tibly clear; &s;o the latter was inadmi&s;&s;ible to the chapel, becau&s;e he had only the defective ordination u&s;ed in the <HI>&s;chi&s;matical,</HI> or ill di&s;ciplined, tho' <HI>national</HI> and <HI>law-e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age is another in&s;tance of the &s;ame tem|porizing prudence: <Q>It is, &s;aid the appellant, not nece&s;&s;ary to enter upon a particular defence of this doctrine, in an under|taking of this nature, &s;ince our pre&s;ent plea is EQUALLY valid, whether the&s;e principles are founded <HI>rightly</HI> or <HI>wrongly:</HI> How|ever a <HI>brief &s;ketch</HI> of the arguments whereby the nece&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal government is <HI>defended,</HI> may on this occa&s;ion be not <HI>altogether</HI> u&s;ele&s;s or improper.</Q></P>
<P>It being impo&s;&s;ible, as <HI>the laws now &s;tands,</HI> to introduce a bi&s;hop into America, who will not have authority the in&s;tant he arrives, to &s;et up an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, to which all denominations will be equally &s;ubject; the Doctor's plea can have no validity at all; &s;ince no man can plead con&s;cience for a mea&s;ure mi&s;chievous or dangerous to his neighbour. But admitting the validity of this plea, &s;urely it mu&s;t at fir&s;t view appear to be a my&s;terious declara|ration,
<PB N="76" REF="010857_0039_0F8524FB703727A8">that it is equally valid whether the divine right of epi&s;co|pacy is well or ill grounded. If the doctrine was not thought to be of importance to the grand thing in de&s;ign, why is a whole &s;ection taken up in an attempt to &s;upport it? His words and his conduct certainly have the &s;hew of repugnancy, and it may &s;erve a good purpo&s;e to gue&s;s at the rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;uppo&s;es a Bi&s;hop to have powers, which no clergy|man in America, <HI>&s;ave the right reverend father in God, the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of Quebec,</HI> can pretend to. If the generality of the reformed churches are not mi&s;taken, every pre&s;byter is a bi&s;hop to all in|tents and purpo&s;es, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of the word. According to this opinion, the Doctor him&s;elf, and the re&s;t of his brethren, who are of the order of pre&s;byters, being in very deed bi&s;hops; the cry &s;et up in the Appeal is idle and ab&s;urd; all this appeal|ing, intreating, weeping, coaxing, and lamentation, being for a boon already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It was therefore of va&s;t importance to the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;cheme he aims at accompli&s;hing, to convict the American churches of error, in denying the &s;uperiority of bi&s;hops above pre&s;byters; &s;ince if this could be done, the con&s;e|quence is undeniable, that every prohibition upon the importation of &s;piritual lords into this country, is nothing le&s;s than a direct oppo&s;ition to the great head and founder of the Chri&s;tian church. It is ea&s;y then to di&s;cern, not only that the plea is not <HI>equally</HI> va|lid whether the principle advanced, is founded <HI>"rightly</HI> or <HI>wrong|ly."</HI> but the rea&s;on of a&s;&s;ertion that it is &s;o.</P>
<P>I am aware of his &s;ubterfuges, 'tis enough if <HI>we believe the doctrines, and it will be per&s;ecution not to allow us the benefits of this article of our faith.</HI> As a Whig, I am utterly oppo&s;ed to the irrational and execrable practice of puni&s;hing people for opini|ons in no degree hurtful to civil &s;ociety, and if the &s;cheme which the author of the Appeal &s;o ardently e&s;pou&s;es, portended no evil to others, I &s;hould bid it <HI>good &s;peed.</HI> But after all, as nothing would more effectually advance the favourite project, than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the divine right of epi&s;copacy, for an inconte&s;ti|ble truth; it can never be &s;aid that the plea in its behalf is as valid, if that doctrine may be di&s;proved, as it would be if it triumphed over all po&s;&s;ible objection; and hence my conjecture that there was a rea&s;on for the Doctor's a&s;&s;ertion, not very con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the whole matter is this, and I &s;ubmit it to the impartial con&s;ideration of the public. Apprehen&s;ive that great execution might be done by the pretended <HI>jus divinum</HI> of epi&s;co|pacy, the Doctor advances, and attempts to &s;upport it: Aware that the application of the doctrine would &s;tartle his countrymen, he affirms the validity of his plea, <HI>independent</HI> of his tenet. Silence upon the &s;ubject might expo&s;e him to his &s;uperiors; avow|ing
<PB N="77" REF="010857_0039_0F8524FB703727A8">its con&s;equences would alarm the people who&s;e a&s;&s;ent is &s;o|licited. In this dilemma, the doctrine is a&s;&s;erted, and the con|&s;equences tenderly mentioned. Like a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er who means to &s;teal a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he works with ha&s;te and trepidation. He gives and takes back; builds upon the foundation of the divine right of epi&s;copacy, and yet treats it as a point of little or no con&s;e|quence. He runs &s;wiftly through a &s;ection more important than the re&s;t with a reference to a dignified author in England, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le read, and to a humbler one here &s;carce known; does all he can to e&s;tabli&s;h his point, and fore&s;talls the &s;everity of the application, by roundly a&s;&s;erting that the plea is as &s;olid without it. After Rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bane, a do&s;e of Opium is admini&s;tered, that the poi&s;on may work while the patient is a&s;leep. and if in all this there appears more of the <HI>wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent,</HI> than the <HI>harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the dove;</HI> how much rea&s;on is there for the &s;imple to beware; and for all to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of the declaration, that bi&s;hops, like the apo&s;tles, <HI>without &s;crip or pur&s;e;</HI> without worldly power and opulence, are the bi&s;hops recommended to the approbation of the continent.</P>

<P>IN your la&s;t <HI>Journal,</HI> I gave my Countrymen a Word of Caution, again&s;t what I believe to be a wicked De&s;ign of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> Whom I take to be <HI>a Snake in the Gra&s;s</HI> a lurk|ing Enemy bent upon Mi&s;chief; who under the &s;pecious Pretence of Zeal for Religious Liberty, (which no Body pretends to re|&s;train, and which is as dear to Epi&s;copalians as to Whigs or any other Denomination what&s;oever) would rai&s;e needle&s;s Fears, Jea|lou&s;ies, Ill-will and Divi&s;ions among us, and thereby divert our Attention from the Dangers that threaten our political Liberty, and the nece&s;&s;ary Means for its Pre&s;ervation. This I believe to be the real and principal De&s;ign of the Whig, and when I
<PB N="78" REF="010857_0040_0F85250A5D633D38">have told my Rea&s;ons for this Opinion, I believe I &s;hall not be &s;ingular in it. But whether I am mi&s;taken or not, with Re|&s;pect to this De&s;ign, I am certainly not mi&s;taken as to the Effects, that, if not check'd and prevented in Time, mu&s;t, whether fore|&s;een and intended or not, naturally re&s;ult from its Pro&s;ecution: The&s;e are Di&s;affection, Di&s;union and Di&s;tru&s;t among our&s;elves; our Attention, our Coun&s;els, our Power, will be divided and weaken'd, we &s;hall lo&s;e all Confidence in each other, our Enemies will gather Strength from our Weakne&s;s, and we &s;hall have no Power of Re&s;i&s;tance left. Let us only, a little, con&s;ider our Situation.</P>
<P>We <HI>Americans</HI> are a Body of People who claim and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal Rights and Privileges, &s;ome of which are common to us all, &s;ome belong to particular Societies of different Sorts, and &s;ome to Individuals. Before any Di&s;putes among our&s;elves can ari&s;e concerning the&s;e Rights, there mu&s;t be &s;omething nice and intricate in the Nature of the Ca&s;e, otherwi&s;e there could be no Di&s;pute; for how can a Di&s;pute ari&s;e about a Matter that is quite plain and &s;elf evident? Every &s;uch Di&s;pute therefore nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a Divi&s;ion among our&s;elves.&mdash;and in order to &s;ettle the Difference between the Parties, we mu&s;t intere&s;t our|&s;elves on both Sides of the Que&s;tion. While the Matter is in Su&s;pence, it is not to be expected that every Per&s;on who hears of, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure becomes engaged in it, will fully con|&s;ider, or under&s;tands the Ca&s;e, and act as an impartial Judge. No,&mdash;Intere&s;t, Connection with the Parties, imperfect Informati|on, Inattention, Pa&s;&s;ion, Prejudice, &amp;c. in every &s;uch internal Di&s;pute, will divide us into at lea&s;t three Parties,&mdash;one on each Side of the Que&s;tion, the other, Neuters.</P>
<P>Now if tho&s;e Rights that we all po&s;&s;e&s;s in common, are in|vaded, Common Prudence and Intere&s;t, direct us to unite in repelling the Invader: But the Rights that we are in Danger of lo&s;ing, are common to us all,&mdash;of every Denomination,&mdash;and we are all equally concerned in their Defence and Pre&s;ervation. Common Sen&s;e then, directs us in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, to wave all Mat|ters of private Di&s;pute among our&s;elves, that &s;o our whole Force may be collected and exerted in Defence of our Common Intere&s;t; we may thus ea&s;ily defeat an Enemy, who if we were divided into the different Parties of which we are compo&s;ed, would in|fallibly &s;ubdue us all, one after another. When an Enemy is at Hand that would plunder us all, of our whole Property, is this a Time to di&s;pute and determine the Difference between our|&s;elves? When a City is on Fire is it a proper Time to determine the particular Property of the Inhabitants? What then &s;hall we think of a Man who manife&s;tly labours,&mdash;who impertinently introduces every far fetch'd Pretence, who makes u&s;e of all the
<PB N="79" REF="010857_0040_0F85250A5D633D38">Arts of Mi&s;repre&s;entation,&mdash;caluminates, reviles, abu&s;es, in&s;ults, and forms Conclu&s;ions again&s;t Probability, again&s;t Rea&s;on,&mdash; in order to embroil all America, and our Friends in England, in a Di&s;pute concerning the Re&s;pective Rights of Churchmen and Pre&s;byterians? Judge my Countrymen! is this Man a Friend or an Enemy? this <HI>Whig,</HI> in his Adverti&s;ement in Parker's la&s;t Paper, artfully endeavours to &s;creen him&s;elf from all Po&s;&s;ibility of Detection, by rai&s;ing a Su&s;picion again&s;t every Per&s;on that &s;hould write any Thing again&s;t him. He tells, <HI>the Public to beware of every Writer who while he affects a Zeal for our Ci|vil Liberties, will not declare his Abhorence of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Ty|ranny.</HI>&mdash;That is, every Writer in favour of our Rights, who don't join in the &s;ame Cry with the <HI>Whig,</HI> and, like the Demon <HI>Anarchy</HI> in Milton, help to promote the Strife, are to be &s;u&s;pected? According to this Rule, the Penn&s;ylvania <HI>Farmer</HI> mu&s;t fall under Su&s;picion. I beg the Reader's Attention to the following Tran&s;cript, from his 12th Letter, the 6th, 7th and 8th Paragraphs.</P>

<P>What then mu&s;t we think of the <HI>American Whig?</HI> does he not fall exactly under the De&s;cription, is he not the very Man this excellent Writer points out, and cautions us to beware of?

<BIBL><HI>John xvi, 2.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN my la&s;t I began to examine the peaceable and gentle &s;pirit of the church of England, and now &s;hall endeavour to trace it a little f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther. The canons of your church, Dr. Chandler, do not &s;eem to us to breathe a very gentle &s;pirit. Your 4th, 5th, and 6th canons &s;olemnly denounce, "that who&s;oever &s;hall affirm, that the form of God's wor&s;hip, contained in the <HI>common prayer</HI> hath any thing in it repugnant to the word of God,&mdash;or that any of the 39 <HI>articles</HI> are in any part erroneous, or &s;uch as may not with a good con&s;cience be &s;ub&s;cribed, let him be excommunicated <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> and not be re&s;tored, until he repent and publickly re|voke his wicked errors." Does not this bear hard on the rights of private judgment, and the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of every Chri&s;tian to examine the Scriptures, "to &s;ee whether <HI>the&s;e things</HI> be &s;o or not?" In the judgement, of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, the noble Baereans were ju&s;tly commended who &s;earched the &s;cripture, and by that infal|lible rule judged of the truth of the doctrines that were preached to them. But the highe&s;t cen&s;ure of the church is inflicted by the church of England, on the per&s;on that would pre&s;ume to judge for him&s;elf and pronounce his judgment, if it &s;hould happen to be again&s;t and thing contained in your 39 articles, common prayer and forms of ordination. Yet there are many things therein, acknowledged by your own mo&s;t learned divines, to need alter|ation, as is abundantly evident from their <HI>candid di&s;qui&s;itions,</HI> &amp;c. And Dr. Chandler him&s;elf, &s;peaking of &s;ome of the laws, which relate to the &s;piritual courts, which are imagined to bear hard upon Briti&s;h liberty, &s;ays, (page 96) "it is probable that the&s;e, and all other eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, as well as our liturgy and pub|lic offices, and our tran&s;lation of the bible, will be reviewed, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be thought that there is good &s;en&s;e and candour enough in the body of the nation to admit of it." It is indeed plea&s;antly ridiculous to &s;ee the mo&s;t zealous advocates of the church of England, and her brighte&s;t ornaments excommunicated <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> by the gentle, peaceable &s;pirit of their own church, merely for confe&s;&s;ing what all the Chri&s;tian churches, as well as them&s;elves, know to be true, that there are many things in their church that need reformation and amendment. By the force of the&s;e canons, the Dr. him&s;elf is really an excommunicated per&s;on, if we can believe the learned primate Dr. Wake, who
<PB N="82" REF="010857_0042_0F85250D6FF6F610">&s;ays, concerning an excommunication <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hat th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re is no need, in the ca&s;e, of an admonition, as where the judge is to give &s;entence, but every one is to take notice of the law at his peril, and to &s;ee that he be not overtaken by it, and that there is no need of any &s;entence to be pronounced, which the canon it|&s;elf has pa&s;&s;ed, and which is by that means already promulged upon every one, as &s;oon as he comes within the obligation of it."</P>
<P>See app. in behalf of the King's Supremacy. p. 22.</P>
<P>If the&s;e canons do not breathe a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit again&s;t the rejectors of epi&s;copacy&mdash;I am &s;ure they breathe a very ungrate|ful &s;pirit again&s;t the mo&s;t valuable members of that church, who would willingly wipe off at lea&s;t &s;ome part of that reproach, which they are &s;en&s;ible has laid heavily upon her ever &s;ince the re|formation. You know reverend Doctor, that the rejectors of your form of church government, have been calling upon your church to reform many things, &s;ome of which the be&s;t men among your&s;elves have confe&s;&s;ed to need reformation, for more than a century pa&s;t; and is there not yet good &s;en&s;e and candour enough in the body of your national church, to admit of &s;uch a reformation? "If this is the complection of your church, what mu&s;t we expect from the plenary e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a church among us, as has not good &s;en&s;e and candour enough in the body of it, to admit of the removal of &s;uch things as have been ju&s;tly complained of &s;o long a time, as an unrighteous per&s;ecuti|on of their brethren, and even unchri&s;tian violation of the rights of con&s;cience and private judgment? The Doctor's conjecture, that "it is probable, that there will be a reformation in &s;ome things in his church." gives us but very &s;lender encouragement to &s;ub|mit to his American epi&s;copate; when we know it is at be&s;t ju&s;t as probable that there will be no reformation in that church, which has &s;o long continued to per&s;ecute her brethren, and yet has not good &s;en&s;e enough in the body of it, to remove the per|&s;ecution. We rather conclude, that as &s;he has encroached &s;o long on the rights of con&s;cience, and oppre&s;&s;ed her fellow Chri&s;|tians, where &s;he has the power in her hands, &s;he would continue to give &s;en&s;ible proofs of the &s;ame peaceable and gentle &s;pirit in America, if &s;he was clothed with the &s;ame civil and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical authority. When &s;he has given &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of her moderation, by re&s;toring her fellow Chri&s;tians to the full enjoyment of their civil and religious liberties, and by abroga|ting the penal laws which oppre&s;s their con&s;ciences, we promi&s;e them we &s;hall entertain fewer jealou&s;ies of the exorbitant power of her bi&s;hops being exerci&s;ed in the colonies.</P>
<P>Pray, is it an equal thing that all denominations of Chri&s;tians, &s;hould be taxed for the &s;upport of epi&s;copal mini&s;ters in the pro|vinces &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that
<PB N="83" REF="010857_0042_0F85250D6FF6F610">thereby &s;ome mini&s;ters of that communion, are enabled to revel in luxury and wantonne&s;s, who, as Dr. Chandler expre&s;&s;es it, "are &s;uch wretches as are not only a &s;candal to the church, but al&s;o a di&s;grace to the human &s;picies?&mdash;Mu&s;t not this be a grief and a burden to &s;uch Chri&s;tians as have any regard to the pro|motion of the Redeemer's kngdom? And mu&s;t it not be peculiarly grievous to other denominations, to &s;upport a church in which the pure wor&s;hip of God is corrupted and ob&s;cured with human inventions, while they "teach for doctrines the commandments of men?" Pray Dr. would you not think it an unrighteous op|pre&s;&s;ion, if the members of your church were taxed for the &s;upport of the church of Rome? I can &s;afely appeal to your own con&s;cience, whether you would not think it &s;o, notwith|&s;tanding all your fond partiality for her, which leads you in a very Chri&s;tian-like manner to unchri&s;tianize the foreign prote&s;tant churches, with the church of Scotland and the Di&s;&s;enters in England, in order to &s;ecure to your&s;elves the unenvied trea&s;ure of an <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion?</HI>&mdash;Remove therefore this in&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion out of your church, and &s;hew us that you have as much moderation as the churches e&s;tabli&s;hed in New-England, who oblige no different denominations to pay to the &s;upport of their clergy, but every one &s;upports its own. Believe me, Dr. had your clergy united together in addre&s;&s;es to your &s;uperiors at home, to obtain a deliverance for the rejectors of epi&s;copacy in the Southern colonies, from this yoke of bondage laid on them for the &s;upport of your church; you had given a more &s;ub&s;tantial proof of your moderation, and regard to the rights of your fel|low Chri&s;tians, than you have lately done in your application for an American epi&s;copate. Do you expect we can lay a&s;ide all jealou&s;y of a church, which we &s;ee oppre&s;&s;ing all others both in England and in the colonies in &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances; regardle&s;s of the rights of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, where &s;he has the power to oppre&s;s; or that we can peaceably &s;ubmit to a &s;cheme, which threatens us with a &s;till farther lo&s;s of our civil and religious liberties.</P>
<P>Thus we have examined the peaceable and gentle &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h epi&s;copal church, and &s;till find in her the mournful relicks of her ancient per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, and from thence conclude, that neither her &s;pirit nor that of the times are &s;o much mended, as to pave the way for an ea&s;y and &s;afe introduction of the be|loved Hierarchy, among tho&s;e who&s;e ance&s;tors abandoned their native country, and all the tender endearments of relations and friends, to e&s;cape her eccle&s;ia&s;tical rage and per&s;ecution.&mdash;Nor is the &s;pirit of her bi&s;hops &s;o much mended, as Dr. Chandler would per&s;uade us. Did not almo&s;t all the bi&s;hops in parlia|ment vote again&s;t the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, and u&s;e their
<PB N="84" REF="010857_0043_0F85250E22247A80">influence to rivet the &s;hackles on the colonies which our enemies had formed? Can we then, expect that tho&s;e, that are &s;o re|gardle&s;s of the property and civil liberties of their fellow &s;ubjects, would be tender of the rights of con&s;cience; or that cho&s;e who &s;o lately manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition to en&s;lave us in one in&s;tance, would not al&s;o oppre&s;s us in another?</P>
<P>But this is not the only indication of their pre&s;ent peaceable and gentle &s;pirit. The epi&s;copal congregation in New-York is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law, and incorporated; when the Pre&s;byterians there applied lately for a charter, did not the bi&s;hop of London appear again&s;t them, and u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to render their application fruitle&s;s and ineffectual? with what pretext then can the epi&s;copalians complain that they do not enjoy the &s;ame privileges with other denominations of Chri&s;tians in the colonies; when them&s;elves think it no inju&s;tice, to prevent others from obtaining the &s;ame privileges with them&s;elves? Nor this is not all, the legi&s;lature of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, moved with pity and compa&s;&s;ion for the poor &s;avages in America, who continue in deplorable ignorance, of the way of &s;alvation through a Redeemer, lately by act of a&s;&s;embly erected a &s;ociety in Bo&s;ton, to &s;pread the go&s;pel through the&s;e benighted tribes; when this law went home for the royal approbation, the pious Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury appeared in per&s;on, and made u&s;e of his exten&s;ive influence to have it repealed. Why &s;hould the highe&s;t dignitary in the church of England, oppo&s;e &s;o well meant a de&s;ign for the conver&s;ion of the Heathens? What have the&s;e poor wretches done to de&s;erve &s;o heavy a &s;troke from his Grace? Was he afraid that the known zeal of the clergy and &s;ociety of Bo&s;ton would engage with vigour in carrying &s;o good a work into execution, and thereby bring a reproach upon a &s;ociety in Eng|land erected for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, who, for more than half a century pa&s;t, have been &s;quandering away large &s;ums of money, collected for the relief of tho&s;e &s;avages, in the &s;upport of a body of mi&s;&s;ionaries, who&s;e u&s;ual feats are &s;ome few conver&s;ions from other denominations of Chri&s;tians to their communions? His Grace can be&s;t tell what were his motives to this conduct; but at pre&s;ent it mu&s;t appear very &s;trange to us at this di&s;tance, that his Grace &s;hould have &s;o little compa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ouls of tho&s;e poor out-ca&s;ts of the human &s;pecies; &s;o little zeal for the promotion of Chri&s;tianity, that he would rather &s;uffer the Heathen tribes behind us, to continue in their deplorable igno|rance without God in the world, and &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e, than that they &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the doctrines of the go&s;pel, by prote&s;tants of a different com|munion.</P>

<HEAD>A WHIP FOR THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. IV.]</HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I intimated in my fir&s;t Paper, that I did not intend to confine my&s;elf to the &s;ervile Bu&s;ine&s;s of animadverting regularly upon every dull E&s;&s;ay that the <HI>American Whig</HI> &s;hould obtrude upon us: But &s;uch of his Performances as de&s;erve it, &s;hall From Time to Time, have &s;uch Notice taken of them as either their Merits or Demerits &s;hall demand. For the pre&s;ent, I beg the Reader's Attention to the two following Pieces which were left at the Printer's for <HI>my</HI> U&s;e, and which I hope, as they are calculated to &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Truth, will be acceptable to the Public.</P>
<P>EVERY careful Ob&s;erver who hath refided any Number of Years in this Colony, mu&s;t undoubtedly have remarked the Conduct of a certain unrelenting, per&s;ecuting, begotted Faction, towards the CHURCH and the CLERGY. They fir&s;t <HI>open'd</HI> with the <HI>Independent Reflector;</HI> A Paper chiefly pilfered from the hireling, republican, dei&s;tical Writers of this and the la&s;t Cen|tury. Their Succe&s;s was equal to their De&s;erts. Their next Attack was from the <HI>Watch-Tower.</HI> This was more furious and wor&s;e conducted than the other. They lo&s;t all Patience, as they lo&s;t all that they were <HI>contending</HI> for: And it was hoped that they had <HI>fallen</HI>&mdash;never to ri&s;e again. For after this the CHURCH enjoyed &s;ome Re&s;pite from their Per&s;ecutions, and <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> might yet have lived in Peace, had not the Ambition of the Faction met with &s;ome equally unexpected and mortifying Di&s;appointments; which together with the di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of an American Epi&s;copate, promi&s;ing &s;ome Advantages to the CHURCH and RELIGION, fired their Envy, and put their Rancour into a Ferment. As the&s;e Writers have now &s;erved two Apprentice&s;hips in Slander and Defamation, we can be at no lo&s;s to a&s;certain what Treatment <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Men are to expect from &s;uch malevolent Spirits.</P>
<P>The Attack was begun by the <HI>American Whig,</HI> with a <HI>Triple Di&s;charge</HI> of <HI>Fal&s;hood, Malice</HI> and <HI>Revenge</HI> (true Independent Artillery!) again&s;t the CHURCH and the CLERGY; In order to hinder her from receiving the full Benefit of her religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, to which, by all the Laws of God and Man, &s;he is inconte&s;tably entitled. The Pretence for this A&s;&s;ault is Dr.
<PB N="87" REF="010857_0044_0F85250EE4C30A90"><HI>Chandler's Appeal to the Public.</HI>&mdash;a Book which, even the Enemies of the CHURCH mu&s;t confe&s;s, is written with the greate&s;t Candour and Mode&s;ty; and as the <HI>American Whig</HI> him&s;elf ac|knowledges, <HI>a&s;ks nothing but what is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t.</HI> One Section however, &s;eems to be wanting, to render the Dr's Per|formance <HI>unexceptionable,</HI> viz. a Section to prove, That the e&s;tabli&s;hing of Bi&s;hops in <HI>America,</HI> would be of no SERVICE to to the CHURCH of <HI>England.</HI> Had it been po&s;&s;ible to have done this, and had this been done, with the &s;ame Force of Argument, and Per&s;picuity of rea&s;oning, with which the whole Book is writ|ten, not <HI>a Dog had moved his Tongue again&s;t it.</HI> But, le&s;t the CHURCH, which by the mere <HI>native</HI> Force of Truth, hath ama|zingly increa&s;ed, e&s;pecially in <HI>New-England,</HI> where it has always laboured under the greate&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;and which, from the Number and Reputation of its Members in this Province, e&s;pecially in the Capital, is really venerable, and commands Re&s;pect; &s;o as to be able to check the <HI>lu&s;tful Thir&s;t of Power,</HI> for which the Ringleaders of the Independent Faction have ever been infamous, from the Day in which the Cockatrice fir&s;t emerged from the Egg, 'till this pre&s;ent Moment:&mdash;le&s;t, I &s;ay, the CHURCH &s;hould re|ceive &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing as the Enjoyment of her religious Con&s;ti|tution;&mdash;le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be put upon an equal Footing with the other religious Denominations in the Colonies, and be made as perfect and complete in <HI>her</HI> Way, as they are in <HI>theirs,</HI>&mdash;every Art is to be u&s;ed, that <HI>Fal&s;hood</HI> can invent, that <HI>Malice</HI> can in&s;ti|gate, or <HI>Revenge</HI> can execute.</P>
<P>Not content with the mo&s;t ample Toleration,&mdash;which inviolably &s;ecures to them the full and peaceable Enjoyment, not only of all their religious <HI>Liberties,</HI> but al&s;o of all their religious <HI>Whims</HI> and <HI>Vagaries,</HI>&mdash;they continually gra&s;p at Power; are always &s;triving <HI>to be the greate&s;t in the Kingdom of&mdash;England;</HI> more e&s;pecially in the King of <HI>England's</HI> American Dominions. And if the CHURCH has the patriotic Re&s;olution, to oppo&s;e the&s;e lordly Saints, and check their <HI>native</HI> Lu&s;t of Domination,&mdash;which by God's Grace, &s;he ever has had, and I tru&s;t in his Goodne&s;s, &s;he ever <HI>will</HI> have;&mdash;all Obligations of Re&s;pect and Gratitude, of Decency and good Manners, of Truth and Honour, are immediately broke thro', being of too <HI>flim&s;y</HI> a Texture to hold an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Indepen|dent, when di&s;appointed of his Prey.</P>
<P>One probable Rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent Clamour is, that the Heads of the Faction have been di&s;appointed in the I&s;&s;ue of a late Election; when, by a well-timed Oppo&s;ition of the mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble Inhabitants of this City, their ambitious and in&s;idious De|&s;igns were defeated; and, as the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Oppo&s;ition came from the Members of the CHURCH, &s;o the CHURCH mu&s;t bear the fir&s;t Fury of their Revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="010857_0045_0F85250FAF222D68">
Another Rea&s;on is, that the&s;e &s;ame <HI>Sons of Di&s;content,</HI> have from true Principles of &s;ound Policy, met with a Repul&s;e in their Application for a Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er; (of E&s;tabli&s;hment, "we are told:")&mdash;and as it would hardly bear to vent their Spleen immediately again&s;t his M&mdash;y, yet his M&mdash;y's <HI>Religion</HI> they pre&s;umed, might &s;afely be attacked, and afford them ample <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>And the grand Rea&s;on of the Attack upon the Epi&s;copal Order, is, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> (as they &s;ay) appeared again&s;t their Charter at the Board of Trade; where, like an HONEST MAN, a worthy Patriot, and a con&s;cientious Prelate, he &s;upported the Rights of the ESTABLISHED CHURCH.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons that very CHURCH, to which they are in|debted for their TOLERATION, is to be painted in the mo&s;t odious Colours, that Fal&s;hood can Invent, or Malace dictate; and the <HI>venerable, primitive,</HI> APOSTOLICAL Order of Bi&s;hops, (without who&s;e Con&s;ent the Act of Toleration could not have pa&s;&s;ed)&mdash;which was ever held &s;acred, even by Hereticks and Schi&s;matics,&mdash;'till Faction, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m, produced this new Sect, this Re|ligion of <HI>Ye&s;terday,</HI> this <HI>motly Mixture</HI> of Ignorance and Pride, Hypocri&s;y and Super&s;tition: This &s;acred Order, I &s;ay, is to be de&s;cribed with all the vile Epithets, that the mo&s;t envenom'd Malice could &s;ugge&s;t, or the mo&s;t flatulent Fu&s;tian could ex|pre&s;s. But why it &s;hould be a Mark of Reproach to the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, that they are <HI>court-favoured,</HI> and <HI>law-dignified,</HI> I can|not conceive. I rather think the <HI>American Whig</HI> intended by tho&s;e Epithets, to hint to his <HI>gentle Readers,</HI> the great Bigotry, Profanene&s;s, and Impiety, of the K&mdash;, the Court, and the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> in giving their Countenance and Protection to <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops.</HI> That it is the introduction of <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops</HI> only, in the Colonies that they oppo&s;e, is evi|dent from the Con&s;ideration,&mdash;that a <HI>Popi&s;h Bi&s;hop</HI> is fixed at <HI>Quebec,</HI> and <HI>Moravian Bi&s;hops</HI> have been in this and many other Provinces, without giving any Offence to the&s;e <HI>Antiapo&s;to|lical</HI> Oppo&s;ers of Epi&s;copacy. But talk of an <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop's</HI> re&s;iding in the <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Colonies,</HI> for the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Purpo&s;es of <HI>ordaining</HI> and <HI>governing</HI> the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and <HI>confirming</HI> &s;uch as are &s;o attached to the <HI>primitive Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> as to de&s;ire to receive that <HI>Apo&s;tolical Rite;</HI> and <HI>&s;uch a Bi&s;hop,</HI> &s;ent for <HI>&s;uch Purpo&s;es,</HI> and for <HI>&s;uch Purpo&s;es only,</HI> is ranked with Impo|&s;itions upon Trade; is declared to be wor&s;e than the <HI>Stamp-Act</HI>&mdash;the wor&s;t Commodity that can be imported; and that his Introduction mu&s;t prove <HI>the ab&s;olute, inevitable De&s;ola|tion and Ruin of this Country.</HI></P>
<P>But Whatever Arts the&s;e <HI>Sowers of the Seeds of public Di&s;cord,</HI> may make u&s;e of, to inveigle the other religious Denominations, to join them again&s;t the CHURCH; the other Denominations&mdash;
<PB N="89" REF="010857_0045_0F85250FAF222D68">all of whom, as far as I perceive, live quietly and peaceably under the pre&s;ent Religious E&s;tabli&s;hment,&mdash;will, I tru&s;t, &s;ee and pur&s;ue their true Intere&s;t; and con&s;ider the CHURCH as in Truth &s;he is, their grand Security again&s;t Independent <HI>Op|pre&s;&s;ion</HI> For I dare pronounce it, That &s;hould God, for the Puni&s;hment of our Sins, ever give up the pre&s;ent happy Con|&s;titution, into the Hands of that per&s;ecuting Faction, no one re+ligious Denomination would enjoy the lea&s;t <HI>Toleration</HI> from <HI>them;</HI> but like the poor, harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive Quakers in <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> mu&s;t be content&mdash;to be HANGED for their Religion.</P>

<P>NO Prote&s;tants have ever given the Government &s;o much Trouble, nor &s;hewn &s;uch fixed and Rooted Enmity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, as that Denomination called Pre&s;byterians:&mdash;Whether this ari&s;es from real zeal for the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tanity or any other Motive, may be an Inquiry.&mdash;At pre&s;ent, I will pa&s;s over every Thing that hath happened on the other Side the Atlantic, and only take a View of them upon, and &s;ince their Settlement on this Continent.&mdash;in Britain, they were ever calling out for Toleration and claimed it as a Right. Upon their Settle|ment in America, their Spirit of Per&s;ecution broke out in full Blaze; and no &s;ooner had they the Power, than every Denomination, par|ticularly the Quakers, very &s;en&s;ibly felt, that this Sect of Men, have little other "Grace than what is founded in Dominion." While other Denominations have contented them&s;elves, with the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion, and an equal Share in the Offices of Government, this Re&s;tle&s;s Sect has in every Colony either at|tempted, or actually &s;eized all Power, and &s;hewn an equal Di&s;|po&s;ition to tyrannize over all others; to root out not only the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion, but every others Denomination from the&s;e Colonies.&mdash;Hardly a Colony on the Continent, but has groaned under their Tyranny, or been agitated by violent Parties fomented by the&s;e People, to advance and procure their favourite Point, Dominion.&mdash;The ea&s;tern Governments are a Proof of the fir&s;t, and the Parties in New-York and Penn&s;ylvania, are recent In|&s;tances of the latter.&mdash;But &s;en&s;ible, that their darling Point can never be attained, while the Church, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tands in their Way, they have ever paid their greate&s;t Attention to prevent its Increa&s;e.&mdash;How have they calumniated her Mini&s;ters, and ridiculed her Ceremonies from Time to Time, as be&s;t &s;uited their Purpo&s;es? And when &s;he a&s;ks, only equal Toleration on this Continent with them, their Pens are employed to alarm the People that &s;ome Encroachment is intended up|on their religious Liberties; and according to the Candor of the&s;e Men, every Story, whether true or fal&s;e, we may expect to &s;ee revived, and new ones propagated, to prevent that Church from being able to &s;tem them in their Career to Power, and
<PB N="91" REF="010857_0046_0F85251063B8A740">hinder them from a&s;&s;uming Dominion over all others. During a late Admini&s;tration, the Province of New-Jer&s;ey, &s;aw and felt the Effects of Pre&s;byterian Power; her &s;eats of Ju&s;tice, &amp;c. Com|mi&s;&s;ions of the Peace, were preferably conferred upon them; their Meeting hou&s;es, which now they affect to call Churches, were every where incorporated, while Charters were denied, not only to Churches, as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, but to other Di&s;&s;enters, who had equal Right with Pre&s;byterians.&mdash;The In&s;tances of their Lu&s;t for Power, and uncharitable Treatment of tho&s;e who differ from them in Opinion, are notorious every where; nor have they ever &s;hewn a Zeal for Religion, or a charitable Di&s;po&s;ition to their fellow Chri&s;tians, but when it &s;uited their Purpo&s;es and favoured their darling Scheme.&mdash;At this Time, when Peace and Chri&s;tian Charity &s;hould mo&s;t abound among us, that Spirit again rai&s;es its Head, aims to throw the Con|tient into Confu&s;ion, and "&s;ow the Seeds of Di&s;cord," to prevent the Church from having its Government fully and freely enjoy|ed; and that too after the Church has, for many Months laid before all Denominations, in an hone&s;t Appeal, the Difficulties &s;he labours under, and the Means &s;he propo&s;es to procure Re|dre&s;s; which is in a Manner, that can give no one Sect any rea|&s;onable Cau&s;e of O&s;&s;ence: Nay, it hath been repeatedly acknowledged, by &s;ome of the be&s;t of them, to be a Mea&s;ure which they cannot di&s;approve of; and what the <HI>American Whig</HI> owns to be "highly rea&s;onable." But it then &s;uited their Po|litics to be &s;ilent; it now &s;uits their Purpo&s;e to kick up a Du&s;t, and inflame and divide all Men as much as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;All other Di&s;&s;enters need not be told, that in the Ruin of the CHURCH will be involved the Ruin of them all, excepting the Pre&s;byterians: And as they have never experienced, nor can from any Thing propo&s;ed in the Appeal, entertain a Doubt that the Church intends the lea&s;t Injury to the religious or civil Rights of any Di&s;&s;enters; &s;o, I hope they will not be led away by the Arts and In&s;inuations of the&s;e Men, to join in a Cry rai&s;ed only to prevent the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of England, from enjoy|ing the like Freedom in Church Government with Di&s;&s;enters,&mdash;but will attend to their Rea&s;onings, if happily any may be found in their Publications, and not permit Wittici&s;ms, or In&s;inuations un&s;upported by good Authority, to beguile their Under&s;tandings; and if then they di&s;cover, that the Church meditates any Thing again&s;t their civil or religious Liberties, it will be their Duty to prevent it: But, if, on the other Hand, it &s;hall be found, that &s;he hath no &s;uch Intentions, Chri&s;tian Charity mu&s;t induce them, not to deny her equal Toleration with them&s;elves.</P>

<P>And the&s;e Appellees do farther &s;ay, that by another act of par|liament made in the 26th year of the &s;ame reign, reciting, that the King ju&s;tly and rightly is, and ought to be, &s;upreme head of the church of <HI>England,</HI> the &s;ame is enacted into a law, and that he &s;hall have full power to vi&s;it, redre&s;s, reform, correct, and re&s;train all errors, here&s;ies, abu&s;es, offences, contempts, and enormities, what&s;oever they be, which by any manner of &s;piritu|al juri&s;diction ought, or may be reformed, redre&s;&s;ed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Appellees farther &s;ay, that by another act of par|liament made in the 37th year of the &s;ame reign, reciting, that archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, or arch-deacons, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, have no manner of juridiction eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but by, from, and under the King's maje&s;ty; it is enacted, that laymen qualified as the law appoints may exerci&s;e all parts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri|diction and all cen&s;ures, coercions, appertaining, or in any wi&s;e belonging thereunto.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Appellees farther &s;ay, that by another act of parlia|ment made in the fir&s;t year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it is enacted, that all Juri&s;diction, privileges, &s;uperiorities, and pre-eminence &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, at any time lawfully u&s;ed, or received, for the vi&s;itation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, or per&s;ons, and for the reformation, order, and correction of the &s;ame, and of all manner of errors, here&s;ies, &s;chi&s;ms, abu&s;es, contempts, offences, and enormities, &s;hall be annexed to the imperial crown of the realm. Wherefore, the&s;e Appellees do &s;ay, that there is no other right of epi&s;copacy within the realm of <HI>England,</HI> than what is derived thereunto by human laws, and that all claim or pretence to any <HI>divine right</HI> of epi&s;copacy by any of the Engli&s;h clergy, (who have &s;worn to the afore&s;aid acts, and are &s;ubject to a proemunire, if they contradict them) is as ab&s;urd, illegal, and nugatory as <HI>the divine right of geography.</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e Appellees farther &s;ay, that they are advi&s;ed by their coun&s;el, that there is no matter or thing in the &s;aid Appeal con|tained, good and &s;ufficient in the law, to call them in que&s;tion in a plea of equity before the tribunal of the publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, but that there is good cau&s;e of demurrer thereto, and for cau&s;e of demurrer they &s;ay,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That the Appellant's &s;aid Appeal (in ca&s;e the allega|tions therein contained were true, which they do in no &s;ort admit) contains not any matter of equity whereon the people can ground
<PB N="94" REF="010857_0048_0F852511F87A6790">any decree, or give the Appellant any relief, remedy, or a&s;&s;i&s;|tance; but that the &s;ame is properly, and only cognizable before the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. For that it appears by the Appellant's own &s;hewing, that he claims, or pretends title in behalf of the bi&s;hops, to one full and equal tenth part (the whole into ten equal parts to be divided) of the premi&s;es in the Appeal mentioned, that is to &s;ay, of all the lands in <HI>North-America,</HI> as per&s;ons next in re|mainder in tail under a devi&s;e of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> in the &s;aid Appeal mentioned and &s;et forth, (or in lieu thereof, by way of a <HI>modus decimandi</HI> to a pecuniary tax to be laid on his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects in <HI>America,</HI> by the re&s;pective legi&s;latures of the colonies, as &s;oon as the &s;aid legi&s;tatures &s;hall be &s;ufficiently &s;wayed by prie&s;tly influence to commit &s;o great an iniquity,) which the&s;e Appellees are advi&s;ed is a matter merely triable at law, and touch|ing which, he may &s;ufficiently a&s;certain their title by ejectment or ejectments to be brought at law.</P>
<P>Thirdly. For that the Appellant hath made a profert of all the negroes in the We&s;t-Indies, who&s;e te&s;timony cannot be ad|mitted in evidence, barely on their being <HI>virtual churchmen,</HI> while they continue, as it appears by his own &s;hewing that they do, in a &s;tate of <HI>heatheni&s;m</HI> and <HI>infidelity.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. For that the Appellant propo&s;es a <HI>harmle&s;s bi&s;hop,</HI> which the&s;e Appellees are advi&s;ed is a thing not known in the law.</P>
<P>Fifthly. For that it appears by the Appellant's own &s;hewing, that he claims title to the &s;aid tenth part of the premi&s;es in que&s;|tion, as agent or attorney to the &s;aid bi&s;hops, by virtue of the <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;</HI> and thereby deduces their title through the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> who by the laws of the land, as the&s;e Ap|pellees are advi&s;ed, cannot be &s;eized of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments within his Maje&s;ty's dominions in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly. For that the Appellees are charged in the &s;aid Ap|peal with <HI>blowing the trumpet of &s;edition;</HI> and they ought not to be compelled to di&s;cover, or &s;et forth any matters, whereby they may impeach or accu&s;e them&s;elves of any crime, for which they may &s;uffer corporal puni&s;hment, or be grievou&s;ly fined.</P>
<P>Seventhly. For that the appellant has appealed to the tribu|nal of the Appellees, and by the law of the land no per&s;ons can be judges of their own cau&s;e; but if the Appellant will never|thele&s;s in&s;i&s;t on having the cau&s;e determined by them, they ad|judge and decree, again&s;t him, and do order and decree, that no bi&s;hop do pre&s;ume to &s;et his foot on the continent of <HI>North-Ameri|ca,</HI> on pretence of exerci&s;ing his function on the &s;ame; and do farther order the Appellant's &s;aid Appeal to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with co&s;ts of &s;uit. And.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="010857_0048_0F852511F87A6790">
La&s;tly. For that the Appellant hath only made profert of part of a certain in&s;trument in &s;upport of his title, pretended to be executed by the right reverend father in God, <HI>John,</HI> lord bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff;</HI> when by the rules of law, he ought to have proffered the whole, that the court might be able to judge, whether by &s;ome precedent or &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e therein, the &s;ame is not null and void, by rea&s;on of &s;undry defects, imper|fections and untruths, which the&s;e Appellees have heard, and do believe is really the ca&s;e. And therefore, and for divers other good cau&s;es of demurrer, in the &s;aid Appellant's &s;aid Appeal of his own &s;hewing, appearing, the&s;e Appellees as to &s;o much there|of, do demur, and do demand judgment of the court, whether they, or any of them ought, or &s;hall be compelled to make any an&s;wer thereto, other, or otherwi&s;e than as herein after followeth; and for an&s;wer to &s;uch part of the &s;aid Appeal as is not pleaded and demurred unto, they &s;ay, for an&s;wer to &s;o much thereof as is to compel them to &s;et forth and di&s;cover their approbation, or di&s;ap|probation of the Appellant's propo&s;al, of importing one or more bi&s;hop or bi&s;hops, into the American colonies; that they do utterly di&s;approve thereof, and will by all lawful ways and means in their power, let, hinder, mole&s;t, interrupt, di&s;turb, ob&s;truct, gain-&s;ay, gain-write, gain-rea&s;on, expo&s;e, defeat, refute, impede, repel, op|pugn, re&s;i&s;t, repul&s;e, oppo&s;e, and contravene, the &s;ame. And as to &s;o much of the &s;aid Appeal as &s;ets forth, that the Appellant did not intend to keep the matter a &s;ecret, the&s;e Appellees do &s;ay, that the Appellant and his a&s;&s;ociates, commonly called, and known by the name of the convention, did, and each, and every of them, did endeavour to keep the &s;ame &s;ecret, privy, opake, covert, and occult; and have expre&s;ly denied the &s;ame, until it was ca&s;ually di&s;covered, by rea&s;on of &s;undry and divers petitions, by them indited and tran&s;mitted to that part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> called <HI>England;</HI> which &s;aid petitions, as the&s;e Appellees have heard, and do verily believe, did contain manifold untruths, im|perfections, a&s;per&s;ion, reflections, mi&s;repre&s;entations, defamati|ons, prevarications, eva&s;ions, tergiver&s;ations, villifications, adul|terations, &s;ophi&s;tications, twi&s;tifications and conundrums. And the&s;e Appellees further an&s;wering, do deny, that any of them have ever per&s;ecuted the church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> or that &s;he has ever been to the knowledge of the&s;e Appellees per&s;ecuted by any other per&s;on or per&s;ons what&s;oever; but that on the contrary, they have heard, and hope to be able to prove, that &s;he appeareth more like a church <HI>triumphant,</HI> than a church <HI>militant;</HI> and all that ever they have, or do intend to devi&s;e and con&s;ide|rate again&s;t her, was and &s;hall be, only <HI>&s;e defendendo,</HI> that &s;he &s;hall not al&s;o become a church <HI>rampant</HI> and <HI>gubernant;</HI> which they are advi&s;ed is well lawful for them to do.

And the&s;e Appellees do &s;ay, that they hope to prove, that the &s;aid Appeal is not exhibi|ted to be relieved again&s;t any real grievance or oppre&s;&s;ion, but for the aggrandizement and exaltation of the epi&s;copal churches, on the ruin of all other Chri&s;tian denominations in his Maje&s;ty's American dominions; and that this &s;uit is not pro&s;ecuted by any number of the members of the &s;aid churches, but at the &s;pecial in&s;tance and reque&s;t, and at the proper co&s;ts and charges of the &s;aid Convention, who not having the peace and tranquility of the&s;e colonies before their eyes, but being moved and in&s;tigated with an inordinate lu&s;t of eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, have retained the Appellant to in&s;titute the &s;aid Appeal, with intent and purpo&s;e to &s;ubject this flouri&s;hing country to prie&s;tly dominion, and the power of high-church; and that the &s;aid Convention have cau&s;e|le&s;ly, and unnece&s;&s;arily, and not only without, but again&s;t the leave, con&s;ent, and approbation of their re&s;pective churches, exhi|bited the &s;aid Appeal, to vex and trouble the Appellees, and to put them to unnece&s;&s;ary charges in the law; of which the&s;e Ap|pellees hope the court will take due con&s;ideration, and con&s;ider the &s;ame in co&s;ts, Without that. &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thus addre&s;s, you as well as Mr. Whig, becau&s;e I beg you will believe, as the truth is, that our country, its people and liberties, are as dear to us of the church, as they can be to any of our neighbours.&mdash;It is but too evident, from the furious and declamatory manner in which the American Whig writes, that he has no notion of attending to the real merits of the cau&s;e; it therefore greatly concerns you, to be much upon your guard again&s;t him; for he is certainly a man of too much &s;en&s;e, not to know that he is mi&s;erably trying to impo&s;e upon his dear country|men, as all his wild talk is quite be&s;ide the que&s;tion, and aims only at rai&s;ing a &s;pirit of venom and bitterne&s;s towards his neighbours, that are of the church.</P>
<P>This is evident from his pretended hi&s;tory of high-church and low-church, N. III. by which he would have it believed, that we being high-church, are little better than papi&s;ts in di&s;gui&s;e, and aim at &s;etting up a &s;piritual tyranny in the country; than which, nothing can be more fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. But the truth of the matter is this, that tho&s;e who were called high-church, were <HI>Jacobites,</HI> or di&s;affected to the pre&s;ent Royal family; where|as we can defy the Whig to produce among us one in&s;tance or &s;ymptom of the lea&s;t di&s;affection to that dear prince, our pre&s;ent mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign King George the III, whom we do know to be a friend to us and our cau&s;e So that the only di&s;tinction that can be here, is between tho&s;e that are intemperately and im|prudently zealous for the church, (if &s;uch there be) and tho&s;e who are of a moderate and Chri&s;tian temper, tho' &s;eriou&s;ly zeal|ous in its cau&s;e, and &s;uch Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> and the re&s;t of us pro|fe&s;s to be. In this &s;en&s;e, there are al&s;o high and low-pre&s;byterians, as well as churchmen. Of the high &s;ort, are tho&s;e that are furiou&s;ly and venomou&s;ly zealous, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Whig.</HI> The low pre&s;byterians are of a moderate and charitable temper towards the church. Of &s;uch I know a great many, (I hope they are much the majority,) with whom I live in good neighbourhood and friend&s;hip, and who declare to me they think Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> is in the right, and that it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable that the church &s;hould have bi&s;hops, as well as they their way.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="010857_0050_0F8525149AFA7E80">
But &s;ays the <HI>Whig</HI> N. IV, with bi&s;hops, there mu&s;t needs come in &s;piritual courts, &amp;c. I an&s;wer there is no nece&s;&s;ary con|nection between them: It is the &s;tate, and not the church, that has made that &s;ettlement; and without the &s;tate no &s;uch &s;ettle|ment can be made here; which therefore never will, nor can be. But pray my dear countrymen, how is it po&s;&s;ible to quiet and &s;atisfy &s;uch a &s;u&s;picious and unrea&s;onable mortal? We do &s;o|lemnly declare, as the truth is, that we do not de&s;ire any &s;piritual courts relating to any of tho&s;e matters he mentions; we are as much again&s;t them as any of our neighbours; nor was any &s;uch thing ever thought of, nor that our bi&s;hops &s;hould have any juridical concern with the laity. We can only beg of you, not to give any heed to him, as it is plain he only de&s;igns to deceive you, and without any manner of ground, to blow up in you the &s;ame malicious and contentious &s;pirit, that reigns in him&s;elf. The apo&s;tle's advice is, <HI>From &s;uch turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do we de&s;ire, or expect any other than &s;uch a moderate and rea&s;onable &s;upport for our bi&s;hops, as &s;hall be judged nece&s;|&s;ary to enable them to live decently, as it becomes their &s;tation, and to be exemplary in the good works of piety and charity, and that without a farthing's expence to the laity; and our de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re is, that their peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be, <HI>only</HI> to ordain and govern <HI>our</HI> clergy (as the primitive bi&s;hops always did) and admit <HI>our</HI> children when <HI>adult,</HI> to renew their bapti&s;mal covenant, which we call confirmation. And for all this, we do (without uncharitably cen&s;uring you,) &s;eriou&s;ly plead con&s;cience; as we do really be|lieve it grounded on the mo&s;t ancient facts of &s;cripture and anti|quity, for which we think we have as much evidence, as for the canon of the new te&s;tament.</P>
<P>And now, my dear brethren, do but mind how ludicrou&s;ly he makes a ridicule of our poor con&s;ciences, and of the national e&s;tabli&s;hment, in No. V. Now it is well known, that the very heathen thought it ill manners, and a crime, as well as ill-po|licy, to vilify and ridicule the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of their nation; and I would only beg leave to add, that if Mr. <HI>Whig</HI> has any &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, to make it his own ca&s;e, and to lay his hand on his heart, and &s;ay, whether he would not think it a barbarous thing, if the pre&s;byterians were obliged to &s;end a 1000 leagues for every ordination, as is our unhappy ca&s;e? But alas! it may de&s;erve to be well con&s;idered, whether a man that makes a ridicule of other people's con&s;ciences, can be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to have any con|&s;cience of his own? I am, my dear countrymen,</P>

<P>LIBERTY is a mo&s;t tender plant that thrives in very few Soils; neglected, it &s;oon withers and is lo&s;t; but is &s;carce ever recoverd. Nothing le&s;s than a &s;upreme regard to this in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, could have induced me to undertake the di&s;a|greeable ta&s;k of a di&s;putant. I conceived it was dangerou&s;ly at|tacked by Doctor Chandler and his a&s;&s;ociates in their attempt to introduce dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops among us, and my de&s;ign was to &s;hew the manife&s;t tendency of the Innovation, to undermine and de|moli&s;h that religious freedom by which the&s;e northern colonies are &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other country; and under the au&s;pices of which, joined with an excellent frame of civil Government, they have beyond all example grown up and pro&s;pered. In &s;ome future papers I &s;hall pur&s;ue the &s;ubject; but at pre&s;ent, I wave it, to make room for the following letter, ju&s;t received from an ingenious corre&s;pondent; who con&s;iders the manner in which our civil liberties mu&s;t be violated, by this &s;cheme of an American Epi&s;copate. As his rea&s;oning appears to be clear and demon&s;trative, I &s;hall be much obliged to him for the continu|ance of his corre&s;pondence.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>To the Author of the <HI>CENTINEL.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a time when the liberties of America are at &s;take; when claims are &s;et up de&s;tructive of our rights as free-born &s;ub|jects, we cannot be too much on our Guard again&s;t any mea&s;ure, that has a tendency to give colour or &s;trength to the&s;e claims, nor ought we to give the le&s;s oppo&s;ition, becau&s;e it has been undertaken with a different de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In this light I view the application for an American epi&s;copate, lately made, by &s;ome of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries from the Society for pro|pagating the Go&s;pel. I would fain acquit the applicants of any intention to infringe the civil rights of the coloni&s;ts; and yet I am clearly of opinion the application has a direct tendency to this, and therefore ought to be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter on any di&s;putes about <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, the divine right of epi&s;copacy,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are &s;ubjects to which I am altogether a &s;tranger. I apprehend Chri&s;tianity can well con&s;i&s;t with the enjoyment of civil liberty; and that a man may wor&s;hip God and be "accepted with him" without becoming a &s;lave, or parting with the rights of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is not more lamentable, than true, that the clergy of all de|nominations and in every age, have di&s;covered a fondne&s;s for power, and have &s;eldom been &s;crupulous about the means of pro|curing
<PB N="100" REF="010857_0051_0F851F7003FCDBD8">it; nor have they u&s;ed it with moderation when obtained. This might be improved as an argument again&s;t every attempt they may make to increa&s;e their power. But waving this, I &s;hal at pre&s;ent con&s;ider the &s;ubject in another view, and endeavour to &s;hew that the application of Dr. Chandler and his brethren, is in it&s;elf a dangerous attack upon the civil liberties of this country. If this can be made evident I hope the Mi&s;&s;ionaries will not only decline every attempt of the like nature for the future, but that they will, from a regard to the liberties of the colonies, unite with their fellow &s;ubjects in oppo&s;ing any &s;teps that may be taken, in con&s;equence of the application already made; and that the Doctor will admit, that the oppo&s;ition, neither ari&s;es from a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, nor from di&s;affection to monarchy.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the far greater part of tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;ettled the northern colonies, left their native country, and took &s;helter in the wilds of America, in order to be free from the per&s;ecution of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers, and to enjoy the liberty of wor&s;hipping God in a way agreeable to their con&s;ciences.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that it was the <HI>unhappine&s;s</HI> of New England and the adjoining Parts, to be fir&s;t planted and inhabited by per&s;ons who were generally di&s;affected to the church by law e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, and many of them had taken refuge in tho&s;e parts, on account of their &s;ufferings for non conformity here at home.</Q>

<P><HI>That it was their unhappine&s;s, thus to &s;uffer is plain enough&mdash; but that it was the unhappine&s;s of the Northern Colonies to be &s;ettled by</HI> con&s;cientious Non Conformi&s;ts <HI>is not &s;o clear.</HI></P></NOTE> Al|though they di&s;claimed the juri&s;diction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y retained their allegiance to the King, and claimed the protection of the Briti&s;h crown. In conformity therefore to the principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, to which they &s;trictly ad|he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, they accepted from the crown a grant for the lands they &s;ettled, and charters declarative of their rights and privileges.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e grants, both they and their po&s;terity ever &s;ince, as free born &s;ubjects, have always claimed, and do &s;till claim, not only <HI>the &s;ole right of di&s;po&s;ing of their property,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>of making, with the con&s;ent of the crown, &s;uch la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and re|gulations, as they think mo&s;t convenient, for their internal police and Government.</HI></P>
<P>Without the full enjoyment of the&s;e rights, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve the lea&s;t &s;hadow either of <HI>liberty</HI> or <HI>property.</HI> For what <HI>property</HI> can any man have in that which another can

<P>It is readily granted that the colonies are dependent &s;tates, united under one head; and with the other Briti&s;h dominions, form one cature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re.

<P>Sufficient caution is taken that this power may not be abu&s;ed. The laws in the colonies mu&s;t be made 'as near as conveniently can be agreeable to the laws and &s;tatutes and rights of the king|dom of England:"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Words of the charter from K.

If the parliament, or any other power upon earth, may e&s;tabli&s;h in the colonies any form of religion, or the heirarchy they plea&s;e, they can grant to the members of that e&s;tabli&s;hment what immunities and exemptions they &s;ee fit, and inflict penal|ties upon &s;uch as do not conform If they may, without the con&s;ent of the colonies, e&s;tabli&s;h bi&s;hopricks and bi&s;hops among us, they may appoint revenues for their &s;upport, erect &s;piritual courts, and enforce obedience to the authority and juri&s;diction of tho&s;e courts.

<P>THE manife&s;t de&s;ign of the author of that paper, is to divide the members of the Church of England, and gain as many as are weak enough to catch the in&s;idious bait he throws out, to join in what mu&s;t finally terminate in the ruin of the Church.

Let us now examine how Mr. <HI>Whig</HI> endeavours to inveigle his readers and bring about his de&s;ign to divide <HI>Churchmen.</HI></P>
<P>He tells us&mdash;<Q>That <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, began the reformation&mdash; that whil&s;t a few embraced the reformation for con&s;cience &s;ake, multitudes &s;ubmitted merely to &s;ave their e&s;tates, and avoid per&s;ecution. Hence the Origin of two famous parties, viz. High church and low church. The former were papi&s;ts in their hearts&mdash;conformed out of &s;elf intere&s;t&mdash;were always mighty &s;ticklers for rights and ceremonies, and the uninter|rupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&mdash;per&s;ecuted all who from a prin|ciple of religion and con&s;cience could not adopt their mea|&s;ures,
<PB N="104" REF="010857_0053_0F851F7187D0F230">&mdash;who&s;e true, if not only de&s;cendants, he &s;ays, the American mi&s;&s;ionaries are at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e they de&s;ire bi&s;h|ops." The low church party were &s;uch as embraced the reformation from con&s;cience, and were di&s;po&s;ed to carry i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fur|ther.</Q> But the&s;e were chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by their grievous lamentations over the <Q>unhappy deficiencies of the church of England, the relicks of popery, &amp;c.&mdash;by their being favoura|ble to prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters; and to crown all the&s;e do not now de&s;ire to impo&s;e dioce&s;an bi&s;hops upon us</Q></P>
<P>Here, to be &s;ure, is a curious &s;pecimen of exact hi&s;torical know|ledge, and of fair, impartial repre&s;entation! That &s;ome em|braced the reformation from temporal views, and motives, I be|lieve, even, altho' a Whig&mdash;nay, even altho' the American Whig him&s;elf affirms it&mdash;that mo&s;t conformed on that account, fact and hi&s;tory evince to be fal&s;e; and it &s;taggers me much to think how any prote&s;tant could throw &s;uch an injurious, unju&s;t reflection on the reformation. As for the other particulars here mentioned, and throughout his paper, they &s;hew in general that this writer is either ignorant of the hi&s;tory of <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e days, and &s;ince that period; or el&s;e that he is guilty of mali|cious mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> VIII was no reformer, nor is he called &s;o by any that I know of, but papi&s;ts. He quarrelled indeed with the Pope, be|cau&s;e his holine&s;s would not grant him a divorce, and therefore threw off the papal &s;upremacy. But &s;till he was a true catholic, if any thing. Before this, he wrote a book again&s;t <HI>Luther,</HI>&mdash; after it, he burn'd tho&s;e who denied tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. It plea&s;ed God, it's true, to order matters &s;o that this quarrel with the Pope proved favourable and <HI>&s;ub&s;ervient</HI> to the reformation; for hereby <HI>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley,</HI> and many others had an opportunity of carrying on the glorious de&s;ign. Nor was this <Q>effected with much force</Q> or violence, as the <HI>Whig</HI> injuriou&s;ly repre&s;ents; but with great mildne&s;s and Chri&s;tian temper, con&s;idering e&s;peci|ally the &s;pirit and circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times. His in&s;inuation that the di&s;tinction of high church and low church originated from the&s;e different motives upon which the reformation was embraced, is as oppo&s;ite to truth as any legend in the Koran. That di&s;tinction was not known for more than a century after; and was invented by tho&s;e who were enemies to the <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Church of England.</HI> But the high church party, &s;ays our <HI>Whig</HI>&mdash;were Papi&s;ts in their hearts&mdash;per&s;ecuted di&s;&s;enters&mdash; were &s;ticklers for ceremonies, and the uninterrupted line of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; whereas the low church party, di&s;avowed all the&s;e, and were for a further reformation. Did the limit of this letter per|mit me, I could, by an induction of facts, &s;hew how contrary to truth the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are&mdash;that the greate&s;t &s;ticklers for cere|monies,
<PB N="105" REF="010857_0053_0F851F7187D0F230">were among the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of popery; and that the warme&s;t friends of <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> were among the mo&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erters of the uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in bi&s;hops, and divine in&s;titution of their order. Let two in&s;tances &s;uffice.&mdash;</P>
<P>The unfortunate LAUD, (&s;everal of who&s;e mea&s;ures I do not approve, though they were the fault of the times, more than of the man; nor was he &s;o blameable by any means as his enemies would repre&s;ent;) He, I &s;ay, was one of tho&s;e no doubt whom our <HI>Whig</HI> will call a &s;tickler for ceremonies; yet he was &s;o far from being a "Papi&s;t in his heart," that no prote&s;tant ever oppo&s;ed popery with greater warmth. He wrote again&s;t it with more &s;pirit and more to the purpo&s;e, than any one <HI>di&s;&s;en|ter</HI>&mdash;nay, than <HI>all of them put together,</HI> from the time of <HI>Harry</HI> VIII, to this day. The pious and learned bi&s;hop HALL is well known to have been a favourer of puritani&s;m,&mdash;was repre&s;ented as &s;uch to the king, (which we learn from him&s;elf) and was one of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Synod of DORT. Yet he was &s;o zeal|ous an advocate for the uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that he proved it in a book he wrote for that purpo&s;e, entitled&mdash;Epi&s;|copacy by Divine Right. And it may with truth be averred, that there has been &s;carce one clergyman of any note in the Church, however favourable to di&s;&s;enters, who did not hold the &s;ame principle with the good bi&s;hop HALL in this re&s;pect. Indeed all hold it, except <HI>Era&s;tians,</HI> who teach that purely &s;piritual powers, like civil are derived from the &s;tate. Even Pre&s;byte|rians, &s;uch of them I mean as know, and will adhere to their own principles.&mdash; believe the uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as much as churchmen; but with this difference&mdash;that the former place the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in pre&s;byters; the latter in bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>High churchmen however, with all tho&s;e vile qualities he is plea&s;ed to give them, were enemies to any further reformation, according to our <HI>Whig;</HI> but low churchmen were perpetually grieving over the relicks of popery, and wanted them to be re|moved. The enemies of the church have often practi&s;ed this method to ruin it, by blackening tho&s;e who thwarted their mea|&s;ures. No Church on earth is more di&s;tingui&s;hed for moderati|on however, or has &s;hewed more indulgence to &s;crupulous con|&s;ciences, than the Church of England; and accordingly, &s;he has made frequent reviews of her liturgy, endeavouring to &s;atis|fy all rea&s;onable requi&s;itions. But were &s;he to gratify the demands of every heated enthu&s;ia&s;t,&mdash;every factious &s;ectari&s;t,&mdash; every re&s;tle&s;s Heretic; &s;he would &s;oon be utterly annihilated, &s;he would neither have ceremony, nor creed, nor article, nor canon left; to the great <HI>contentation</HI> of <HI>Papi&s;ts, Arians, Socinians, American Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> who have been formerely, and are
<PB N="106" REF="010857_0054_0F851F71DE241C38">at this day, as loud as our author him&s;elf could wi&s;h them to be, in their demands for a further reformation.</P>
<P>As this writer's aim is to divide the church, by reviling her friends, and all this to &s;erve his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, he prudently pa&s;&s;es over that period when his party triumphed in her ruin. it was his intere&s;t to do this; as the bare mention of it would re|vive no very plea&s;ing ideas in his readers, nor &s;ugge&s;t any thing favourable to his partizans. But it may be proper to remind Americans, that when the predece&s;&s;ors of our <HI>Whig</HI>&mdash;(into whom, as well as into the faction he is leagued with, the &s;pirit of the&s;e king-murderers, and church-de&s;troyers &s;eems to have <HI>tran&s;migrated;</HI>) when they, I &s;ay, had gained the a&s;cendency by cutting off the King's head, and overturning the con&s;tituti|on; they exerci&s;ed &s;everities on the members of the Church, which were &s;carce exceeded by the mo&s;t per&s;ecuting <HI>Heathens.</HI> In the year 1645 <Q>a fine of &pound;. 5 was impo&s;ed on any per&s;on who u&s;ed the prayer book in any Church, or private hou&s;e, for the fir&s;t offence; &pound;. 10 for the &s;econd; and one whole year's im|pri&s;onment, without bail or mainprize for the third.</Q> Up|wards of SEVEN THOUSAND clergymen were &s;eque&s;tered, plun|dered and ruined; many of whom were, for piety, Wi&s;dom, and learning, the brighte&s;t ornaments of Chri&s;tianity &s;ince the reformation.</P>
<P>Nor can this be wondered at, if we reflect on the intolerant principles that prevailed among tho&s;e &s;anctified <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and were re&s;ounded even from the pulpit by their mo&s;t admired teach|ers. The following is a &s;mall &s;ample of what I have collected from their writings; more of which I &s;hall hereafter produce, if nece&s;&s;ary. "Toleration." according to them, <Q>was a city of refuge in men's con&s;ciences for the devil to fly unto,&mdash;a toleration of &s;oul murder; for e&s;tabli&s;hing whereof. damned &s;ouls in Hell will cur&s;e men upon earth,&mdash;a tran&s;cendent, catholic, fundamental evil,&mdash;the abomination of de&s;olation. all the devils in hell, and their in&s;truments, are at work to promote a toleration.</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>O MY COUNTRYMEN!&mdash;beware of tho&s;e who are the a|vowed defenders of the men that taught the&s;e principles; and who give but too glaring proofs that they inherit the very &s;ame temper and &s;pirit! What might churchmen, and every other denomination, look for from them, &s;hould Heaven permit them again to domineer over their fellow &s;ubjects!</P>
<P>Our <HI>Whig</HI>'s attempt to di&s;unite us reminds me of the practices of Papi&s;ts, (in which the Je&s;uits were principal agents) to divide and di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ract the CHURCH of England, and finally ruin her. This method of embroiling Prote&s;tants, by promoting a variety of &s;ects among them. They have always e&s;teemed the mo&s;t effectual to
<PB N="107" REF="010857_0054_0F851F71DE241C38">bring them back to the bo&s;om of <HI>Mother Church;</HI> and have employed many emi&s;&s;aries for that purpo&s;e. The &s;tory of <HI>Heath,</HI> a Je&s;uit, is well known. He was di&s;covered by a letter which he accidentally dropt; and at his examination confe&s;&s;ed&mdash;<Q>That he had been &s;ix years in <HI>England,</HI>&mdash;had laboured to refine Prote&s;tants from all <HI>Smacks</HI> of ceremonies, and to make the Church purer.</Q> <HI>Camden, Fuller,</HI> and other hi&s;torians, men|tion "&s;everal men, among whom <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leman, Burton, Hallingham,</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> were the mo&s;t forward, who were great fomenters of the church-divi&s;ions in Queen Elizabeth's reign. "The&s;e," &s;ays <HI>Camden,</HI> <Q>under pretence of purer reformation, oppo&s;ed the di&s;cipline, liturgy, and Calling of Bi&s;hops, as approaching too near the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></Q> Yet it was undeniably proved afterwards, that tho&s;e very puritan reformers,&mdash;<HI>Coleman, Burton, Hallingham,</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> who <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> the <HI>Calling</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI>&mdash; were <HI>Je&s;uits in Di&s;gui&s;e,</HI> employed on purpo&s;e to promote Po|pery. Nor is there any que&s;tion but &s;everal Je&s;uits were among <HI>Oliver</HI>'s ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Thorough-Reformers.</HI></P>
<P>By rea&s;on of my di&s;tance from your city, I cannot tell how mat|mers are &s;ituated there. But I heartily wi&s;h that no <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> may have crept in among you, who foment &s;trife to &s;erve the papal cau&s;e. I mu&s;t confe&s;s there are &s;everal <HI>&s;u&s;picious Symptoms</HI> that this is the ca&s;e; as fir&s;t, the di&s;advantageous light in which this third <HI>Whig</HI> would place the <HI>Reformation,</HI> which is always done by Papi&s;ts, and by none el&s;e. <HI>Secondly,</HI> the furious outcry which I find is rai&s;ed again&s;t an <HI>American Epi&s;copate,</HI> which tallies exactly with the &s;entiments of Papi&s;ts with re&s;pect to <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The famous cardinal <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erini</HI> declared&mdash;<Q>He could be &s;atisfied there were no prie&s;ts in <HI>England,</HI> provided there were no bi&s;hops neither; for he then &s;uppo&s;ed the Ca|tholic cau&s;e would certainly prevail and do its own work.</Q> Sure I am that the Papi&s;ts, have frequently taken the &s;ame me|thods to ruin the Church, that your factious <HI>Whig</HI> is now u&s;ing; nor could they proceed with more art or effrontery. And what heightens my &s;u&s;picion is, that altho' a Popi&s;h bi&s;hop has been lately &s;ent to America, I never could learn that the faction made the lea&s;t clamour or noi&s;e about him. A Prote&s;tant epi&s;copate is what they oppo&s;e. And they are wi&s;e in their generation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take no further notice of the palpable fal&s;hoods in this piece, which may boldly contend for number with the lines;" but &s;hall reque&s;t every hone&s;t, candid di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reader to reflect, whether it be con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on or equity, that the Church &s;hould labour under the hard&s;hips with which it now &s;truggles! whether it be right or ju&s;t that our clergy &s;hould be at the expence of going three thou&s;and miles for ordination, and run the re&s;que of cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic Ocean, which has proved
<PB N="108" REF="010857_0055_0F851F7404BB1328">fatal to &s;o many of them; Whether it be right that many con|&s;cientious Chri&s;tians &s;hould be deprived of the apo&s;tolic ordinance of confirmation, which they think it their duty to receive?&mdash; Or whether &s;o many Churches &s;hould continue vacant and di&s;|titute, for want of proper officers to ordain Clergymen to &s;upply them? All the motives of piety, truth, rea&s;on and equity, &s;trongly remon&s;trate again&s;t each of the&s;e grievances, and urge that they &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed.

Yet I here declare, I am utterly and ab&s;olutely again&s;t bi&s;hops having the &s;ame powers they have in England; and for this plain rea&s;on, that it would injure both the Church &amp; the Colonies. I only want Bi&s;hops on the plan propo&s;ed in doctor Chandler's appeal.

<HEAD>[From Mr. Parker's New-York Gazette, Monday, May 2d. THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. VIII]</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<P>THE prerogatives peculiar to a Bi&s;hop above pre&s;byters, ac|cording to the reverend doctor of a neighbouring borough, are tho&s;e of ordination, confirmation, and government. And as he confe&s;&s;es that our own mi&s;&s;ionaries have authority to exclude the profane from the &s;acrament, which is the highe&s;t &s;anction for pre&s;erving the purity of the church, as he knows our epi&s;copal candidates can make voyages to England, and get the bi&s;hops hand on their heads and learn politene&s;s into the bargain; and as he dare not a&s;&s;ert, that faith and repentance will not &s;ave an American &s;oul, without epi&s;copal confirmation; I cannot &s;ee the
<PB N="109" REF="010857_0055_0F851F7404BB1328">advantage, and much le&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity, of importing a cargo of &s;piritual carnalities into the country, to tyrannize over a people, who fled three thou&s;and miles to be relieved from their tythes and their courts.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t therefore be at the bottom of his earne&s;t and ela|borate appeal, &s;ome attribute of his lord&s;hip, which the Doctor thinks incommunicable to a pre&s;byt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and which he hath not yet been plea&s;ed to di&s;clo&s;e. All the power nece&s;&s;ary for good govern|ment is already transferred; and as to the trip for ordination, it it is &s;o far from an inconvenience, that it doubtle&s;s conduces much to the reputable figure of the mi&s;&s;ionaries. It is al&s;o a proof of their courage and zeal, two indi&s;pen&s;ible qualifications of a Chri&s;|tian &s;oldier, and if the expence was con&s;iderably inhanced, the church would be better &s;ecured again&s;t an old complaint of the Jews, that prie&s;ts were made of the meane&s;t of the people.</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;umption, that the bi&s;hop will bring powers that can be delegated to no other order of the clergy, it &s;tands the Doctor in hand to prove, (and for that rea&s;on doubtle&s;s we are obliged to him for his &s;ketch in favour of) the divine right of epi&s;copacy. But le&s;t any thing &s;hould be grafted upon this &s;tock, that may hereafter produc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poi&s;onous fruit, I &s;hall fill up this paper with &s;ome general remarks introductory to a minute exami|nation in &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent numbers, of the Doctor's argument, in &s;upport of a tenet, given up by &s;everal bi&s;hops of great name; and which, while it claims peculiar honours for his own church, and the church of Rome, contains odious imputations upon all the other churches in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>In that ever memorable eccle&s;ia&s;tical revolution, commonly called the reformation, mo&s;t of the clergy who revolted from the dominion of the bea&s;t, avowed the principle, that the di&s;tinction between a bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter, was a popi&s;h &s;ubtilty, contrived to favour the &s;piritual de&s;poti&s;m of antichri&s;t. This, after the example of other monarchies, advances in a regular gradation from the humble prie&s;t or curate, thro' the intermediate order of par|&s;on, vicar, prebend or canon, dean arch deacon, bi&s;hop, arch bi&s;hops, and cardinals, up to the Pope, or infallible Emperor, of the great &s;piritual body. Finding no &s;criptural authority for this regimental progre&s;&s;ion, the reformers very naturally imputed the whole contrivance to that pride which began to work in the mother of the two &s;ons of Zebedee, and was prophetically fore&s;een, and foretold by the humble Di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved. They &s;et out therefore, with a declaration of the equality of the clergy, as mo&s;t agreeable to the will and words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, that he who would be greate&s;t, &s;hould be the &s;ervant of the re&s;t; and indeed it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to the permanence of their op|po&s;ition; the order of bi&s;hops li&s;ting la&s;t of all others, as they
<PB N="110" REF="010857_0056_0F851F746C6ED8F0">had mo&s;t to lo&s;e, under the banners of the reformation. The glorious, work was began by pre&s;byters, and if they were not admitted to be bi&s;hops, and authorized to ordain others, the pro&s;|pect was clear, that unle&s;s the bi&s;hops joined in the revolt again&s;t his holine&s;s, the cau&s;e could la&s;t no longer than the lives of the fir&s;t in&s;urgents: They therefore denied the epi&s;copal prehemi|nence to be founded upon the authority of Chri&s;t; and for con|tending that the powers of bi&s;hops and pre&s;byter, were the &s;ame, the greater part of the re&s;omed churches became Pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P>As it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, the prote&s;tant clergy in general, to have had &s;imilar &s;entiments of the hierarchy of Rome, the church di&s;cipline of England, if their di&s;&s;ent had been conducted by her prie&s;ts, would have been nearly the &s;ame with that &s;et up in France. Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, and the other re&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned naturous. But as a King took the lead, and the pride of Henry VIII. induced him on the one hand to oppo&s;e the Pope, and on the other to di&s;approve the humbling ca&s;t of the pre&s;by|terian model: it is not to be wondered at, that he contented him&s;elf with rejecting the &s;uperior, and leaving all the lower or|ders inviolate; his true aim being only to be the Pope, or his Holine&s;s of England Hence the permi&s;&s;ion of the old popi&s;h ranks as high as the arch bi&s;hop, and his contempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Papa, and the legates and cardinals, officers pertectly u&s;ele&s;s on his own a&s;&s;umption of the &s;upremacy of the church.</P>
<P>The people of England &s;aw the imperfection of the reforma|tion in that Kingdom, but there were a thou&s;and objections to their interpo&s;ition. Be&s;ides the authority of the King, which would &s;uffer no controul, the catholics were &s;till powerful, and the higher clergy had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tained no lo&s;s either in point of opu|lence or dignity. And therefore the pre&s;byterian bia&s;s, and prin|ciples of the other branches of the reformation, did not begin to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ert them&s;elves op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly in England, till a &s;ucceeding reign. The leaven was never<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s working; but the religion, which was grafted upon the old hierarchy, growing venerable and &s;trong, and receiving the &s;upport and countenance of the law; the im|patience of tho&s;e who had now lo&s;t all hopes of a nearer confor|mit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the other reformed churches abroad, could be no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;&s;ed. And as the di&s;content advanced to a re-reformation, oppo&s;ed not only by the government, but by the dignified clergy, who were contented and at ea&s;e, they fell under a variety of leaders, and &s;plit into all that diver&s;ity of per&s;ua&s;ions &s;o favoura|ble to liberty and philo&s;ophy, and now comprehended under the general name of Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>For the truth of the&s;e remarks, I appeal to the hi&s;tory of the church; and they are introdaced to &s;hew that an attachment to the dogma, that bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to pre&s;byters, is peculiar, com|paratively
<PB N="111" REF="010857_0056_0F851F746C6ED8F0">&s;peaking, to but a very &s;mall part of the prote&s;tant world; England and Sweden being the only nations, who have in this re&s;pect, with&s;tood the light of the reformation. I am a|ware, that the Appellant for an epi&s;copate in this country, will tell me, that if the argument is to be carried by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity of voices, he is &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e the opinion he favours prevailed from the days of St. Ignatius to Calvin, an interv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of not le&s;s than 1400 years. By &s;ome it will be thought a full an&s;wer, that the &s;entiments of the reformed, are in this ca&s;e, authorities infinitely preferable &s;o that of a church, confe&s;&s;ed on all hands, to have corrupted the &s;aith; and which was the more &s;ucce&s;sful, as like other harlots, &s;he had philtres and love potions to be&s;tow "out of the golden cup in her hand, full of abomination and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hine&s;s of her fornication."</P>
<P>But this it not the mo&s;t logical u&s;e I would make of the univer|&s;ality, if I may &s;o &s;peak, of the prote&s;tant di&s;avowal of the &s;upe|riority of bi&s;hops to pre&s;byters. I will grant the Appellant, that the fir&s;t ages of the church, before the &s;carlet whore had defiled the nations, furni&s;hed in&s;tances of martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors, who do hounour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the religion which they &s;ealed with their blood; and it will be no prejudice to my argument, if I even admit (tho' Lord Chanceller King is of a very different opinion, and for rea|&s;ons which no bi&s;hops have yet &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered) that tho&s;e holy men of old con&s;idered a prie&s;t as a bi&s;hop's inferior, I &s;ay all this I will admit, and that the opinion prevailed from century to century, down to the dawn of the reformation. But, on the other hand, it will not be a&s;&s;erted, that any primitive Chri&s;tian died a martyr to that tenet, nor denied that the prote&s;tant churches have exhibited an innumerable company of illu&s;trious witne&s;&s;es for the purity of the &s;aith, who believed and practi&s;ed the very rever&s;e, as mo&s;t agreeable in their conceptions to the vo|lumes of divine in&s;piration. If the zealous contender for an American epi&s;copate, &s;upports the divine right of epi&s;copacy, the glorious in&s;truments of the reformation in Holland, Scotland, and Switzerland. and el&s;ewhere, who tho' pre&s;byters ordained others, and governed their churches; and all tho&s;e numberle&s;s lights of the church, who without the aid of a bi&s;hop in pre|ceeding ages, and to this very day, have &s;ounded, and are &s;till &s;ounding the go&s;pel trumpet, with a &s;ucce&s;s that &s;hews the con|currence of the unerring &s;pirit of all truth; they mu&s;t, as un|authori&s;ed for the work, be con&s;idered as mi&s;taken or impudent pretenders, to a commi&s;&s;ion they neither had nor have. But as their erudition and abilities give ground for &s;trong pre|&s;umptions in favour of their knowledge; and their lives defy the impeachment of malice it&s;elf; and we have &s;en&s;ible evi|dence, if I may &s;o &s;peak, of the power of the go&s;pel upon the
<PB N="112" REF="010857_0057_0F851F74E4F8FF10">hearts of millions, by their in&s;trumentality, and &s;till more un|deniable proofs of the non-nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copal authority to &s;ave &s;ouls from perdition; I conclude from the&s;e premi&s;es, what I have always believed, that the &s;acred volume makes no dif|ference between a bi&s;hop and any other mini&s;ter. Nay, farther, that as God the father of all, left mankind at liberty to &s;et up that kind of civil government which tends mo&s;t to their tem|poral felicity; &s;o our ble&s;&s;ed lord e&s;tabli&s;hed no particular form of church government, but (a &s;ew general canons excepted, friendly to the general di&s;cipline of the reformation, and incul|cated as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t that execrable &s;pirit of pride, which by his omni&s;cience he fore&s;aw would &s;oon ari&s;e in the churches,) left his followers to choo&s;e &s;uch models, as be&s;t an|&s;wered the ends of good order, and the pre&s;ervation of &s;ound|ne&s;s both in faith and in manners.</P>
<P>In all &s;ocieties whether civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, &s;ome kind of government there mu&s;t be; and no one can pretend, that the militant &s;tate of the church, requires the aid of revelation to point out a proper form of di&s;cipline, more than the general condition of mankind does any mode of national government. Both mu&s;t be adapted to the circum&s;tances of their re&s;pective members; and as Chri&s;tianity, whenever it comes, finds civil government of one kind or another already formed; and it was certainly not the de&s;ign of our lord to demoli&s;h the old bond of &s;ociety; and to &s;ome of the&s;e, one form of church di&s;cipline would be more agreeable than another; and in others, &s;carce any of the known models could conveniently take place; it is a na|tural pre&s;umption, and a tolerable argument a priori, that none of the various forms for which mankind contend with &s;uch de&s;|tructive and unchri&s;tian zeal, have any other <HI>jus d&igrave;vinum</HI> for their foundation than the dictates of found rea&s;on, and with that on their &s;ide, what need there any other? for of all that have this, it may be alledged, whether the government be a civil or religious, one, that it is the ordinance of God, and to be &s;ubmitted to for con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>But to return more immediately to the point which the doc|tor a&s;&s;erts. Since the divine author of Chri&s;tianity doubtle&s;s aim|ed, above all things aimed, at the conver&s;ion of the heart, for the recovery of a revolting world to the allegiance due to the creator; and this was infinitely of more con&s;equence, than the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties under a monarchial, or repub|lican, or any other particular form of government; and &s;ince of the many millions of hone&s;t men, who have &s;dulou&s;ly peru&s;ed the &s;criptures to find a difference between a prie&s;t and a bi&s;hop, it &s;till remains a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ecret that any &s;uch difference is revealed; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e no rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned, why heaven &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h

But &s;till clearer to &s;hew that he gropes in the dark, and is in this re&s;pect either de|ceived, or a deceiver of others, or both, &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome future paper.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE already endeavoured to &s;hew from the principles of liberty, that the Briti&s;h parliament ought not to interfere in the civil police of the colonies; and that any application to that augu&s;t body, directly or indirectly, to make laws for us, or to e&s;tabli&s;h among us any form of church di&s;cipline, de&s;erves to be
<PB N="114" REF="010857_0058_0F851F7FD93D9BE0">treated as an attack upon our civil liberties. I &s;hall further evince this, from the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who gave, and the conduct of tho&s;e who received, the &s;everal provincial charters: This will tend not only to enforce the arguments already advanced, but to give a clearer view of our con&s;titution, by tracing it back to its fir&s;t principles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>I wi&s;h the maxim of <HI>Machiavel</HI> was followed; that of ex|amining a con&s;titution at certain periods, according to its fir&s;t Principles; this would correct abu&s;es and &s;upply Defects.</Q> <HI>Lord</HI> Cambden<HI>'s Speech. &amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Before I proceed, it may not be ami&s;s to offer a few reflections on the nature of charters.</P>
<P>I have heard it advanced by men, who ought to know better, that the people derive their rights and liberties from the charters granted by the crown. Nothing can be more groundle&s;s than this. A people derive their liberty from God, the author of their being.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Abeo Libertas, a quo Spirites. <Q>We are born free, as we are born rational; ge that brings one brings the other too.</Q> <HI>Locke on</HI> Govt. <HI>61.</HI> Again, <Q>voluntary Agreement gives political power to Governors, for the benefit of the &s;ubjects, and &s;ecures them in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of their properties.</Q></NOTE> When for the &s;ake of &s;ecurity and other advantages they enter into &s;ociety, and form governments, individuals part with &s;ome of their natural rights, freely giving up &s;uch as are incon&s;i&s;tent with government, and inve&s;t their chief magi&s;trates with &s;uch power as is deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the defence, protec|tion, and &s;ecurity of the whole. Hence it appears, that obe|dience and protection are relative terms: where the one is not granted, the other is not due.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that different nations, according to the degree of &s;trength, valour, under&s;tanding, and public virtue, or vigour of &s;pirit, that prevailed in them, have &s;urrendered more or le&s;s of their natural rights. But as power is of an encroaching nature; ever on the watch to extend its &s;way; and ever tenaci|ous of what it has obtained; hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t nations, tho&s;e endowed with the greate&s;t degree of ability, bravery, and public &s;pirit have often found it dif|ficult to guard again&s;t the encroachments of their rulers, and to defend their Liberty again&s;t the attacks of wicked Princes.</P>
<P>Our ance&s;tors, whether we trace our orgin from the ancient Britons, Picts, Scots, Saxons or Angles, pre&s;erved an uncon|querable love of liberty. Though they paid a ready obedience to government, and revered the ju&s;t authority of their Kings, yet they kept the legi&s;lative power in their own hands; and obliged their Princes to &s;wear, "that they would hold, keep and de|fend
<PB N="115" REF="010857_0058_0F851F7FD93D9BE0">the ju&s;t laws and cu&s;toms, <HI>quas vulgus elegerit</HI>", (which the people &s;hould choo&s;e)<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> Coronation Oath.</NOTE>. But as &s;ome of their Kings in|fluenced by wicked de&s;igning mini&s;ters, endeavoured to &s;ubvert the liberties of the people, and to e&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary government, it became nece&s;&s;ary to reduce them to rea&s;on, and to a&s;certain the limits of their power. This gave ri&s;e to charters; which are no more than &s;olemn declarations of the rights inherent in the people, and the privileges they are intituled to under that government to which they are &s;ubject; and which being grant|ed, or in other words acknowledged, and &s;ub&s;cribed by the King, or &s;upreme magi&s;trate, bound his power, and limit his preroga|tive. Of this nature is that commonly called Magna-Charta; the great charter of England; which is only an abridgement of the ancient laws and cu&s;toms of the realm. Of the &s;ame na|ture is the petition of rights, granted by King Charles the fir&s;t, and confirmed at the revolution. Charters therefore are not to be con&s;idered as mere matters of favour, conferred by the grace of the prince, but declarations of the rights and privi|leges inherent in the people.</P>
<P>Thus at the &s;ettlement of a colony far di&s;tant from the Mo|ther-Country, when the King grants a charter to the coloni&s;ts, with power to make laws for their good government, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they derive that power from the charter. It was inherent in them as freemen. They enjoyed it before in their native country. They carried it with them. And when &s;ettled in the new country might have exerci&s;ed it, though no charter had beed granted.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thus the former Colony of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in New-England, acted for many Years without Charter or Commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;See <HI>Hutchin&s;on's</HI> Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE> It was prudent indeed to receive a charter, in order to &s;ettle their rights, to direct the mode of ex|erci&s;ing their privileges, and to a&s;certain the bounds of royal prerogative with regard to them, and the authority of the crown to which they acknowledged allegiance.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am &s;orry the charters which have been granted are not explicit enough. It is indeed to be lamented, that the prerogative of the crown, or the privileges of the people &s;hould ever be liable to di&s;pute, in any &s;ingle branch of either. By means of this, the public has often &s;uffered great inconveni|encies. Had the rights of the people been fully and clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e charters, according to the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and the idea that even then prevailed in the minds of people, it might have prevented claims that have lately been &s;et up, and di&s;putes that threaten the peace of the empire.

<P>It is a fir&s;t principle in the con&s;titution of England, that the happine&s;s of the Subject is the end of government, and that the &s;afety of the people is the &s;upreme law. As then the people are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t judges of what will promote their own good, and mo&s;t intere&s;ted in what conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us their own &s;afety it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that no human laws, can, or ought to bind them, unle&s;s made with their con&s;ent.

<P>Whatever rea&s;on there might be for granting particular In|dulgences to tho&s;e who with great danger, fatigue and expence undertook to &s;ettle colonies in the wilds of America, and there|by to extend the Briti&s;h dominions, and increa&s;e the power, wealth and influence both of the crown, and inhabitants of Britain, yet &s;urely there could not be the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on for depriving them of the privileges of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Had there been the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of this, it is not to be imagin|ed, that freemen, much le&s;s men of rank and fortune, &s;uch as many of the fir&s;t adventurers were, would ever have hazarded the attempt. Far different were their views. In going abroad to &s;ettle colonies they con&s;idered them&s;elves intituled to all the civil rights and liberties of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, at the &s;ame time that they were freed from the oppre&s;&s;ions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, as well as from &s;ome particular cu&s;toms, tenures and u&s;ages, which by the common and &s;tatute law, were confined to certain di&s;tricts in England.</P>
<P>Thus in every charter granted to the colonies, the rights of Engli&s;h free-born &s;ubjects, are confirmed to the coloni&s;ts; and in particular a power of making laws for their internal Govern|ment. It is indeed provided, that the laws &s;o made &s;hall not be repugnant to the laws of England: a provi&s;ion founded on wi&s;dom and good policy. For a &s;imilarity of manners and cu&s;toms is a great bond of union among &s;ubjects of the &s;ame King. In &s;ome charters, particularly tho&s;e granted to people who left their native country from religious motives, a liberty of con&s;cience in the wor&s;hip of God, is allowed to all Chri&s;tians, except Roman Catholicks.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Charters of</HI> Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, Connecticut Rhode-I&s;land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> The only &s;tipulation in &s;avour of any particular denomination, is that found in the charter granted to William Penn; which provides, that <Q>If any of the in habi|tants.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Am &s;orry to find any one, who calls him&s;elf a churchman, endeavouring to propagate &s;uch crude notions as are contained in a letter "to the American Whig," which he has thought fit to publi&s;h in his 4th number. I have heard it di&s;puted in &s;everal companies, (to the credit of the church of England be it &s;poken) whether it is po&s;&s;ible this letter-writer can be a churchman in any &s;en&s;e; and, whether this piece is in reality any thing el&s;e than a letter from the American Whig&mdash;to his own dear &s;elf. The former of the&s;e two que&s;tions was generally decided in the Ne|gative; the latter in the Affirmative; and the pretence of ex|hibiting a letter of this &s;ort from a Churchman, was looked upon as a Manaeuvre, from which it was natural to expect &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s. Again&s;t this opinion I have no material objections; and yet, upon the whole, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity on the other hand, for concluding that the per&s;on in que&s;tion is not a churchman in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, as the &s;trangene&s;s of &s;uch a Phaenomenon may be ac|counted for, upon St. Paul's maxim expre&s;&s;ed in the motto to this paper. But whether he be American Whig or American Churchman, &s;ince he attempts to rea&s;on, I will readily hear him. For I love rea&s;oning dearly, e&s;pecially after &s;uch tedious expec|tations, and wretched di&s;appointments.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="010857_0060_0F851F845E012700">
Before this writer enters upon the main point which he under|takes to defend, he makes an introductory remark upon the tend|ency of wealth and power to ruin the Chri&s;tian Church; intima|ting the great plea&s;ure it would give him, to &s;ee the Church in puris Naturalibus, without a Fig-Leaf to cover her, as &s;he fir&s;t exi&s;ted&mdash;when &s;he was per&s;ecruted and oppre&s;&s;ed by the vicil power,&mdash;and when the Mini&s;ters of this religion were obliged to &s;helter them&s;elves "in dens and caves of the earth," being, a|bove all others, "di&s;titute, afflicted, tormented." The Clergy in particular ought to be obliged to him for his kind wi&s;hes, well knowing that every man will exert him&s;elf, as he has opportu|nity, to bring about an event which is the object of his wi&s;hes. But after all, he has &s;aid nothing again&s;t the power and wealth of the Clergy, which will not conclude as &s;trongly again&s;t wealth and power in the hands of other per&s;ons. If power has been abu&s;ed by the clergy, it has been no le&s;s wantonly abu&s;ed by Princes and civil magi&s;trates. If wealth has a tendency to corrupt the Clergy, it is not found to have a better effect upon Chri&s;tians in any other &s;tation of life. He might therefore with as much Propriety "be oppo&s;ed" to the "Annexations" of private Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they have better bread and butter, and are &s;uffered to eat it more quietly, than the primitive Chri&s;|tians.</P>
<P>But could we &s;uppo&s;e wealth and power have a tendency to corrupt the clergy only, and that the&s;e things operate in the &s;ame manner upon no other human creature; the ob&s;ervation notwith&s;tanding, as it is made here, is intirely mi&s;placed. It is become the common practice of the various writers again&s;t the ap|peal, to harangue upon this popular &s;ubject; and yet I am not able to di&s;cover that the Appeal has given any ju&s;t occa&s;ion for it. For any one with half an eye, that is willing to u&s;e it rather than to &s;ee by hear&s;ay, as Don Quixotte &s;aw his Mi&s;tre&s;s, may ea&s;ily and clearly &s;ee for him&s;elf, that the Appeal propo&s;es no &s;cheme to aggrandi&s;e and enrich the American Clergy, or to impoveri&s;h and depre&s;s the American laiety. It propo&s;es indeed Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, but without any temporal power, and without juri&s;dictions over any per&s;ons at all, the Clergy of the Church only excepted. What foundation then is there for all this Racket and Flu&s;tration about the power of American Bi&s;hops, when, upon the propo&s;ed plan, they are to have no power at all over the Clergy of other denominations, nor over the laity of any denomination? But, it &s;eems, the contrary to this is attempted to be proved by the writer before us; and I am impatient to &s;ee in what manner he will acquit him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The reader therefore will excu&s;e my pa&s;&s;ing over his incom|prehen&s;ibly &s;ublime and exqui&s;itely &s;agacious critici&s;m upon the
<PB N="120" REF="010857_0061_0F851F84E4B13FE0">di&s;tinction between a Churchman, an American Churchman, an American Church of "Englandman," and an American Epi&s;|copalian: e&s;pecially when I a&s;&s;ure him of my utter inability to explain the di&s;tinction, made by our critic, between an American Church of Englandman, and (to u&s;e the &s;ame phra&s;eology) a Church of England in America-man.</P>
<P>Let us then attend to a proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, which now, for the fir&s;t time, appears in the American Whig. The point under|taken to be proved is this, that <Q>with the Bi&s;hops (propo&s;ed to be &s;ent to America) we &s;hall naturally have the introduction or e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts</Q> Our di&s;|putant &s;tates his propo&s;ition with all the &s;olemn &s;tiffne&s;s of a Ramus or a Burger&s;dicius, and gives the &s;ignal that the mount|ain is in Labour, with &s;uch awful formality, that every reader has a right to expect that the production will be more than a mou&s;e.</P>
<P>For my part when I had proceeded thus far in reading the paper, I expected to &s;ee a terrific movement of Syllogi&s;ms ranged in rank and file, and to hear the ratling of a &s;trong logical chain, to the end of the chapter. But I was mi&s;taken. I find but little marching and countermarching of arguments; and the chain con&s;i&s;ts of but three &s;hort links, which have neither &s;olidity nor &s;trength.</P>
<P>For, of the thirteen paragraphs that follow, there are but three wherein any proof is attempted.&mdash;Two others are manife&s;tly intended to &s;hew his immen&s;e erudition in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical-Law,&mdash;and as to the de&s;ign of the other eight, I am unable to fix it with any certainty. All that I know about them is, that they prove nothing, and that they take the thing for granted which it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to prove. As I think it not worth while to &s;ay any thing farther to them, or about them, <HI>i. e.</HI> to or about the&s;e eight paragraphs of the epicence or doubtful Gender; I will confine my&s;elf to the three rea&s;oning, and the two o&s;tentatious ones.</P>
<P>Let us then fir&s;t con&s;ider the three, and take them in their order. <Q>The Bi&s;hop's title, &s;ays this writer, is not derived from the apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion: They are &s;eized by the law of of the land, and will hold their preheminencies 'till this law is altered by King, Lords, and commons.</Q> If by the <Q>Bi&s;hop's title</Q> he means the right to their temporalities, we are will|ing to grant, that it is not derived <Q>from the apo&s;tolic commi&s;|&s;ion,</Q> for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a clergyman's right to the u&s;e of a Par&s;onage, or to the money &s;ub&s;cribed or promi&s;ed for his &s;upport, is not derived "from the apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion." Bi&s;|hops in England are inve&s;ted with rights of this nature <Q>By the law of the land;</Q> but I have never yet heard that any "law of the land," <HI>i. e.</HI> of England, conveys or confirms, or
<PB N="121" REF="010857_0061_0F851F84E4B13FE0">&s;pecifies, or meddles with the rights of Bi&s;hops who do not re&s;ide in the land, <HI>i. e.</HI> in England. The laws of England, &s;o far as they relate to Bi&s;hops, have reference only to Bi&s;hops in England: what &s;hall be the condition and authority of Bi&s;hops in America, or any other country, they have never yet undertaken to de|termine.&mdash;Our letter-writer having gained nothing by his fir&s;t effort, let us &s;ee how he &s;ucceeds in his &s;econd.</P>
<P>"Lord Hale, &s;ays he, meaning Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice (as we &s;ay, not Lord Sherlock, but Dr. Sherlock, Lord Bi&s;hop, &amp;c.) "tells us&mdash;that every Bi&s;hop by his election and confirmation, even before con&s;ecration had eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;|diction "annexed to his office." What juri&s;diction every Bi&s;hop formerly had, and how he obtained it, are to us matters of mere &s;peculation: what juri&s;diction every Bi&s;hop now has, is a more important que&s;tion, I have not lately read Sir M Hale's <Q>Hi&s;|tory of the common law,</Q> to which we are here referred; nor do I remember what he &s;ays of the rights of Bi&s;hops: but in this I am clear, that he undertook not to define the rights of any Bi&s;hops, but of tho&s;e in England,&mdash;that he meant not to explain what would be the rights and powers of American Bi&s;hops. And the pre&s;ent que&s;tion is, not what rights the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops have had, or now have, but what authority American Bi&s;hops will have when they are appointed. So that this &s;econd paragraph of our American Wh&mdash;I mean Churchman, we may &s;ay, Item, gained nothing.</P>
<P>But perhaps, according to the old proverb, it may concern us to beware of the third; and it is certain that in this he endeavours to drive home and clench the argument. Thus he goes forward: <Q>The Bi&s;hop's right to open his court being therefore &s;ecured by the common law, and that being univer&s;ally acknowledged to be the law of the colonies, his Lord&s;hip will find no difficulty, after his dioce&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed, or erect a Tribunal, &amp;c</Q> This writer does not tell us, what he means by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the American Bi&s;hop's dioce&s;e,&mdash;nor whether he thinks "his dioce&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;hed" by common law. If by e&s;tabli&s;hment he means a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, we may, as is propo&s;ed in the appeal, have Bi&s;hops in this country without any e&s;tabli&s;hment of dioce&s;es, in this &s;en&s;e of the word. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, for the pre&s;ent, that the dioce&s;es in America will obtain a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment; yet &s;till it will depend upon the nature of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, what powers will thereby be granted to American Bi&s;hops. An <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|bli&s;hment of dioce&s;es by no means implies an equality of ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d power in the Bi&s;hops that govern them. It will hardly be di&s;|puted that the dioce&s;es in England are e&s;tabli&s;hed dioce&s;es; and yet the Bi&s;hop of Durham has &s;ome rights and powers, to who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> other Bi&s;hops in England are not intitled; as they all have &s;ome
<PB N="122" REF="010857_0062_0F851F856B39FAA0">rights to which the Bi&s;hop of Man has no claim or preten&s;ion; and yet the Bi&s;hop of Man is as much a Bi&s;hop of the Church of England, and all the acts of epi&s;copal power,&mdash;his ordinations, confirmations and government of the Clergy,&mdash;are equally valid with that of the Bi&s;hop of Durham, or any other Bi&s;hop whatever. What has been here &s;aid proves, that altho' dioce&s;es &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, it does not from thence follow that there mu&s;t be an "e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts.</P>
<P>The truth is, the body of Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tical law is com|pounded of the civil law, the common law, the canon law, and the &s;tatute law. Now a right to hold &s;piritual courts, which is founded on the common law only, can be no more than a general right; and if there be no canons, nor &s;tatutes, to regulate and direct it, it can never operate. Such a right is an ab&s;tract idea, and it can produce only ab&s;tract courts, which can have nothing to do with individuals, or with particular ca&s;es. I have &s;o good an opinion even of American Whigs, as to believe they have no great aver&s;ion to &s;uch &s;piritual courts as the&s;e, which can never exi&s;t but in theory and &s;peculation.</P>
<P>If by the common law, or any other law, American Bi&s;hops will have a right to hold courts, in the &s;ame manner that they are held by bi&s;hops in England, it mu&s;t be by virtue of the Church of England's having a full and general e&s;tabli&s;hment in the American colonies. For upon any other principle I defy this writer and his patron, and their confederates, to &s;hew, that <Q>with the bi&s;hops, we &s;hall naturally have the introduction or e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;piritual or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts.</Q></P>
<P>It may therefore be proper, before we proceed to other matters, to &s;ettle this capital Point; whether the church of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies? if it is, perhaps &s;ome act of the legi|&s;lature will be nece&s;&s;ary for the election of &s;uch an epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed in the appeal, which act the friends of an American epi&s;copate can probably obtain, without much difficulty. If the church of England is not e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, than all this clamour again&s;t &s;piritual courts as nece&s;&s;arily connected with an American epi&s;copate, is groundle&s;s and impertinent. But as too much of "the dry cru&s;t of controver&s;y" at one time, may have an ill effect upon the &s;tomachs of the American Whig and his fellows, I will withhold my hand for the pre&s;ent, having, I fancy, already given him and them more than they can manage at one breakfa&s;t. I propo&s;e however to re&s;ume this &s;ubject in &s;ome future paper, and to give out &s;ome more of this dry cru&s;t, by the time they &s;hall have well &s;wallowed, chewed the cud upon, cou|cocted, and dige&s;ted their pre&s;ent meal.</P>

Where then the nece&s;&s;ity of all that follows, which tho' artfully, is yet evidently intended, to run an odious parallel between the Epi&s;copalians and Non Epi&s;copalians of North-America? <HI>But on the other hand, we claim a right to be con|&s;idered as equal with the</HI> MOST <HI>foremo&s;t in every due expre&s;&s;ion of fidelity and loyalty.</HI> And &s;urely it is to be hoped, that the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> foremo&s;t claim a right of being con&s;idered as equal with him, and all tho&s;e who con&s;titute his important <HI>we,</HI> in every the like expre&s;&s;ion.

But le&s;t this in&s;inuation of our &s;ecret principles, cruel as it is, &s;hould prove in&s;ufficient to draw down the re&s;ent|ment of our mother country in that mo&s;t tremendous expre&s;&s;ion of it, the &s;ending us a Bi&s;hop, without a farther &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;ome more overt acts, to deferve her &s;evere&s;t indignation, the Doctor is determined to make thorough work with our political characters: <HI>Accordingly,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>no trumpet of &s;edition was ever heard to &s;ound from our pulpits; no &s;eeds of di&s;affection have been &s;uffered more privately to be &s;own in our hou&s;es.</HI> And pray in what pulpits has this gentleman ever heard the trumpet of &s;edi|tion? I think I may challenge him to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of any other trumpet's having ever been heard to &s;ound from any di&s;&s;enting pulpit, than that very trumpet, which it were to be wi&s;hed was oftener heard to &s;ound from all the pulpits in the world, I mean the trumpet, &s;o &s;olemnly commanded to be blown
<PB N="125" REF="010857_0063_0F851F8639E98BD8">in the 50th of I&s;aiah, and the 33d of Ezekiel; even that trumpet which is to warn the people, and to &s;hew them their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. This trumpet, I am confident, is as faithfully &s;ounded from di&s;|&s;enting, as from epi&s;copal pulpits; and I am further confident, that the &s;ound thereof is of much greater moment to the cau&s;e of virtue and true religion, than the ob&s;treperous noi&s;e of that little paultry Rams-Horn of epi&s;copal-Sectariani&s;m, (which is con|&s;tantly blown, where ever the &s;ociety will club for a blower,) to increa&s;e the party by a collection of fugitives from other religious &s;ocieties; which, with notable a&s;&s;urance and the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of truth, is annually repre&s;ented to the di&s;&s;enters in Britain, (who are great contributors to this perverted charity) as propagating the go&s;pel among the native pagans of America. It is in a word, a trumpet of infinitely greater importance to the &s;ouls of men, than the creaking, &s;queaking, &s;kreaking Bag-pipe of Arminiani&s;m, which is perpetually played by tho&s;e who have &s;olemnly &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed never to play it; and who&s;e un|&s;criptural whi&s;tlings, are enough to whi&s;tle us all into perdition.</P>
<P>The Doctor has however, tho' probably without de&s;ign, be|trayed the true foundation of his exuberant zeal for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment. <HI>We e&s;teem our&s;elves bound by pre&s;ent intere&s;t, &amp;c. to &s;upport to the utmo&s;t the national civil e&s;tabli&s;hment.

But this gentleman will give me leave to tell him, that how often &s;o|ever this &s;eed might have been &s;own, and how certain &s;oever the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive eve-dropper may be what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed a man &s;ows pri|vately in his own family; one thing I know, that it hath never yet been &s;een to grow in this country.

<HEAD>A full and complete an&s;wer to all the numbers of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> that have as yet been, or ever will be publi&s;hed.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;currilous author may pretend to what he plea&s;es, but the public is well apprized of his de&s;ign; he wants to be the head of a faction; and to throw the province into confu&s;ion; he is a perfect Hydra; or may more properly be called Legion; for he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with many devils; they are &s;crubs and &s;cavengers; nor are we ignorant of his per&s;on: He is a long-no&s;ed, long|chin'd, ugly looking fellow. Nay I have the authority of a doctor of divinity, to call him that animal, before which we are not to throw pearls. He is a man of a rueful length of face, a libertine, a bu&s;y factor in di&s;&s;ention, of an ambitious di&s;appointed faction: His papers are &s;tuffed with low, &s;purious wittici&s;ms, mi&s;repre&s;entations, &s;currility, buffoonery, fal&s;ehood, abu&s;e and &s;lander. He is a cunning fellow, and a pragmatical a&s;&s;umer. His faction is enraged to a degree of phrenzy. He is &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Don Quixote, an invidious calumniator, a fal&s;e accu&s;er of the brethren, and a brother of &s;avages. He was a friend to the &s;tamp Act; for I never heard that he wrote again&s;t it, and therefore he did not write again&s;t it, and therefore he was a friend to it; and how then can he be a friend to religious liberty? yea, I &s;ay a|gain, and intend to repeat it a thou&s;and times; he was a friend to the Stamp-Act, to the Stamp-Act, he was, was, was, a friend to the Stampt-Act. He is, (or for the &s;ake of variety, let us have the plural number,) they are public incendiaries, &s;owers of di&s;|cord, abu&s;ive adver&s;aries. He pays not the lea&s;t attention to truth and decency. He is an abominable hobbler, and a de&s;troyer of that harmony which ought now to be &s;o greatly encouraged. For what is religious liberty in compari&s;on of our civil privileges? It is non&s;en&s;e, and not worth contending for. They are pre&s;by|terians, independents, Abaddons, Apollions, dei&s;ts, &s;ons of Beli|al, and grand&s;ons of Belzebub, arch-rebels, apo&s;tates, Browni&s;ts, Muggletonians, fifth-monarchy men, Oliverians, Spino&s;i&s;ts, en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, fanatics, and king-killers. They oppo&s;ed the college, they oppo&s;ed the harmle&s;s &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in the manor of Philip&s;burgh; and would, if they could, be&s;tride the north-we&s;t wind, fling the church out of the windows, make the convention dance a hornpipe behind the moon, &s;trike fire out of a cucumber, build &s;tone &s;ences of &s;pider's webs, turn the whole world top&s;ey-turvey, and &s;et fire to the pacific ocean. Nay, this very &s;ame identical fellow, who writes again&s;t the Bi&s;hops in
<PB N="128" REF="010857_0065_0F851F87A073B188">New-York, writes al&s;o again&s;t them in Philadelphia. This &s;ame Whig, &s;crub and &s;cavenger, is the &s;ole and only author, and in|&s;tigator of all the mi&s;chief on the continent, and is the only man who is again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate, tho' not one in a thou&s;and is for it. He was begotten by de&s;peration in a total eclip&s;e of the &s;un, on the bodies of &s;even infernal furies Nor does he write from any regard to liberty, but from a di&s;appointment at a late election. For tho' his Printer can inform any man, that he had agreed to publi&s;h the Whig before that election; yet, for all that, it was the di&s;appointment in that election, that was the &s;ole cau&s;e and origin of the Whig. Yea, it was al&s;o the origin of the Centi|nel, and of Dr. Chauncey's an&s;wer to Dr Chandler's appeal. The di&s;appointment I &s;ay, at a late election: The di&s;appoint|ment! The di&s;appointment! This I will al&s;o repeat a thou&s;and times; and it is a full an&s;wer to all that has, or ever can be wrote again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate. He neither values his own reputation, nor the reputation of any one el&s;e. He has no more con&s;cience than a dog that p&mdash;s again&s;t a church door.</P>
<P>They are an unrelenting, per&s;ecuting, bigotted faction, to|wards the church and the clergy. They have &s;erved two ap|prentice&s;hips in &s;lander and defamation. They began with the triple di&s;charge of fal&s;ehood, malice, and revenge again&s;t the CHURCH, (the church I &s;ay, in capitals, that is to &s;ay, the only church in the colonies, the epi&s;copal church,) and the clergy, that is the convention, who are the only clergy in the country. The metamorpho&s;is of this creature is unaccountable; fir&s;t he was an Independent Reflector, which lo&s;t us half the money out of which we intended to defraud the public, for the public good, that is to &s;ay the College: Then he was a watch Tower, and gave &s;o true and &s;hocking an account of our per&s;ecutions and iniquities, that we never can renew them, but the province is alarmed. At pre&s;ent he is a Whig, and a Devil of a Whig he is; and ten to one, but before he is a year older, he will &s;ubmit to circumci&s;ion, and turn Mahometan. I have a&s;&s;erted three times already, and intend to do it forty times more, that him&s;elf ac|knowledges, that the Appeal a&s;ks nothing but what is rea&s;onable and ju&s;t; this I know to be a lie, becau&s;e he &s;ays, it is &s;pecious, and &s;eems to a&s;k nothing, &amp;c. and then declares in &s;ub&s;tance, that none but an ideot will take the appearance for reality. But where is the harm of lying for the church, e&s;pecially when it can be done &s;o ea&s;ily as by the omi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle word? To return to the argument, he is a dog, and moves his tongue again&s;t the Appeal; he is a cockatrice, and u&s;es every art that fal&s;ehood can invent, that malice can in&s;tigate, or revenge can execute. He breaks through all obligations of re&s;pect and gratitude, of decency and good manners, of truth and honour. Though he is tole|rated
<PB N="129" REF="010857_0065_0F851F87A073B188">in a country, where there is no e&s;tabli&s;hment, and con&s;e|quently no toleration, yet he paints the very church that tolerates him, in the mo&s;t <HI>odious colours, that fal&s;ehood can invent, or malice dictate.</HI> He is a <HI>new &s;ect, and his religion of ye&s;terday, a motley mixture of ignorance and pride, hypocri&s;y and &s;uper&s;tition.</HI> He is the pe&s;t of &s;ociety, and a combu&s;tible, fit for eternal com|bu&s;tion. He has a chin of a foot long, and a no&s;e of &s;ixteen inches. It is true, Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> invites every man to offer his objections to his Appeal. But his Appeal was wrote with real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and the author never &s;o much as thinks of it but with &s;olemnity and devotion; and &s;hall &s;uch a &s;erious, &s;olemn, reverend, right-reverend, and thrice-reverend, precious little book as this, be attacked by <HI>&s;crubs,</HI> and <HI>&s;cavengers,</HI> and <HI>&s;wine.</HI> Be&s;ides, the Whig mu&s;t either write gravely or merrily. When he attempts to be merry, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that he is &s;cur|rilous; and when he writes &s;eriou&s;ly, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that he is dull; and is the doctor to be an&s;wered either with &s;currility or dullne&s;s? <HI>He is born with an evil &s;peaking, lying, and &s;landering con&s;titution, and he deals out &s;lander and invective, as liberally as the di&s;putants of Billing&s;gate. They de&s;erve to be la&s;hed at the cart's tail. Inflamed with party rage, actuated by low &s;elfi&s;h motives, and goaded on by malice, he pours out a torrent of &s;lander. He is in a violent rage, a Je&s;uitical &s;ophi&s;ter, and furious per&s;ecutor, and of intolerant principles, de&s;igning to en&s;lave others, amid&s;t his cla|morous outcry for liberty. His effrontery and malice, I think de|&s;erve, and would ju&s;tify wor&s;e treatment than a regard to my own character would &s;uffer me to give him. He is a &s;cribbler, a &s;lan|derer, a reviler, a &s;niveler, a &s;norter, a roarer, a raver, and a &s;pitter of venom.</HI> Thus <HI>have I gently corrected the American Whig,</HI> for the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his pen; and whoever denies that I have wrote with the greate&s;t decency, moderation, and &s;trength of argument, is a villain and a &s;coundrel.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY view in the&s;e letters is not to combate any religious de|nomination, nor to oppugn the theological opinions of any man or &s;et of men, but to defend the liberties of my country. Had any other &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians applied in the &s;ame manner for an e&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hould have thought it my duty to object to it, and as far as my influence could extend, to oppo&s;e the de|&s;ign. Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, Pre&s;byter or pa&s;tor have no magic in them to ju&s;tify with me, any attempt prejudicial to public liberty.</P>
<P>It is very unfortunate that any di&s;pute &s;hould be rai&s;ed in A|merica, at a cri&s;is, when union of &s;entiment and de&s;ign, &s;eem e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving our civil rights.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Affair &s;eems to have ri&s;en in the time of the <HI>Stamp-Act.</HI> How &s;ome people love to fi&s;h in troubled Waters!</NOTE> A &s;hip's crew quarelling in a &s;torm, or when an enemy is within gun-&s;hot, does not argue a greater degree of infatuation. For what pur|po&s;e, or with what view it is &s;tarted at this critical time, I do not willingly allow my&s;elf even to conjecture.

<P>For the debate, as I view it, is not concerning a Bi&s;hop, nor concerning epi&s;copal di&s;cipline; but about the manner of intro|ducing the Bi&s;hop, and e&s;tabli&s;hing that di&s;cipline in America. It is evident from &s;undry Parts of the Appeal, that application has been made to our &s;uperiors in Britain to procure an act of parliament to e&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy in the colonies.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Appeal.

However I hope the friends of the colonies, whether of the Epi&s;copal, or any other church, will unite in oppo&s;ing an attempt, which is in it&s;elf an open acknowledgment of the claims which the enemies of America have lately &s;et up, and which are totally &s;ubver&s;ive of our rights and liberties.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the application had been made to the parliament of Ireland, or to the legi&s;lature of Virginia, to e&s;tabli&s;h epi&s;copacy in New-England, in what light would it have appeared.

<P>The Briti&s;h empire con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal provinces united in al|legiance to one prince. The legi&s;lative power of and for each province, con&s;i&s;ts of the King or his repre&s;entatives, with the Deputies of the people in that province. Tho' Great-Britain is now united in one legi&s;lative body or parliament, it was not many ages &s;ince, divided into &s;everal di&s;tricts, with di&s;tinct legi&s;latures in each. At that time it was not pretended, that the laws of one, bound the &s;ubjects in another province. Each, with the con&s;ent of the &s;overeign, or his repre&s;entative, enjoyed the right of legi|&s;lation for it&s;elf. Britain, &s;ince its union into one legi&s;lative body, has acquired greater <HI>power;</HI> but whether it has thereby acquired a <HI>right</HI> to make laws to bind the other parts of the Empire, re|mains to be proved. There is certainly a difference between <HI>power</HI> and <HI>right;</HI> nor does the one follow as a con&s;equence of the other, for if power gave right, then would the &s;tronge&s;t have a right to whatever he plea&s;ed to &s;eize on: and <Q>the high-way man would have a right to my pur&s;e, who demands it with a pi&s;tol to my brea&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke,</NOTE></Q></P>

Whether a &s;ettled revenue is e&s;&s;ential to a Bi&s;hop; or whether the Church of Eng|land in America (as it is called) is &s;o peculiarly different from all other Chri&s;tian Churches, that even under the fulle&s;t and free&s;t &s;tate of religious liberty, it cannot enjoy the "form of its eccle&s;ia&s;|tical government and di&s;cipline, without an act of parliament to e&s;tabli&s;h it."</P>
<P>Religion and government are certainly very different things, in|&s;tituted for different ends: the de&s;ign of the one being to pro|mote
<PB N="133" REF="010857_0067_0F851F8921A22B20">our temporal happine&s;s, the de&s;ign of the other to procure the favour of God, and thereby the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. While the&s;e are kept di&s;tinct and apart, the peace and welfare of &s;ociety is pre&s;erved, and the ends of both an&s;wered. But by mixing them together, feuds, animo&s;ities and per&s;ecutions have been rai&s;ed, which have deluged the world in blood, and di&s;graced hu|man nature.</P>
<P>In the middle and ea&s;tern governments of North-America, the legi&s;latures have, with great wi&s;dom, taken care to keep the church di&s;tinct from the &s;tate. They have made laws to &s;ecure to the people in general and to each member in particular, the full enjoyment of their civil rights, intere&s;ts, and properties; and have armed the Magi&s;trate with power to enforce the execution of the&s;e laws. But at the &s;ame time individuals are left at full liberty to unite them&s;elves into &s;ocieties<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome of the Colonies indeed, one religious Society, is forbid|den, not on Account of Religion, but on Account of certain political Principles, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of the State. How far the fears which tho&s;e Governments have con|ceived again&s;t that Society are well-founded, I will not undertake to &s;ay. In <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> where it is tolerated, no inconveniencies have ari&s;en. However, it is not to be denied, that the Magi&s;trate has a right to prohibit the propagating of Opinions or Doctrines, which are contrary to human Society, or to tho&s;e moral Rules, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of human Society.</NOTE> for the public wor&s;hip of God, in &s;uch a manner as they judge acceptable to him, and effectually to procure eternal life and happine&s;s. This indeed may be di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e, who complain, that <Q>altars are &s;et up again&s;t altars, and churches again&s;t churches, and that tho&s;e who are rejected by one, may be received by another;</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr. C's <HI>Appeal.</HI>&mdash;Page <HI>31.</HI></NOTE> but certainly nothing can be more con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and religion, or more agreeable to the &s;incere lovers of liberty.</P>
<P>How long we &s;hall enjoy the happine&s;s of this con&s;titution, if e&s;tabli&s;hments can be impo&s;ed on us without our con&s;ent, is very uncertain. Let us therefore with one heart and with one mind unite in &s;upport of our common rights, and re&s;olve to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage.</Q></P>

<P>To what this &s;pirited corre&s;pondent has here, &s;aid I have added &s;ome notes, to &s;hew that if the Epi&s;copalians in this country are under any difficulties, they ari&s;e from them&s;elves; either be|cau&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="010857_0068_0F851F89EE613310">cau&s;e they have adopted &s;ome confined notions concerning the Epi&s;copal character; or from an arbitrary and needle&s;s a&s;&s;ociation of &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hment with church-government in their ideas of it; or la&s;tly from an a&s;&s;uming di&s;po&s;ition, which prompts, them to claim the &s;uperiority over their neighbours, who reject epi&s;copacy</P>
<P>For if the &s;ame privileges, which other denominations enjoy, would &s;atisfy their Clergy, why did not the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, in&s;tead of &s;ending &s;even petitions to England for Bi&s;hops, proceed to choo&s;e one of their number to be their &s;uperior, and voluntarily agree to be governed by him. Thus their hierarchy might have been completed, without lord|ly revenue, &s;tate appointment, or giving ground of jealou&s;y to others. The Moravian Bi&s;hops, who &s;tand on this footing, never gave any Umbrage.</P>
<P>But a voluntary epi&s;copate, in the primitive way, or as other &s;ocieties enjoy their forms of di&s;cipline, will not &s;atisfy the mi&s;|&s;ionaries. <HI>They</HI> and their people are <HI>the church, the American church;</HI> as it were emphatically and exclu&s;ively; all others are Hereticks or Schi&s;maticks. <HI>They</HI> are <HI>the Church of England in America;</HI> nay, <HI>the national Church,</HI> and of the national religion; and mu&s;t be rai&s;ed upon the depre&s;&s;ion of all other Churches, who&s;e members are already termed <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Appeal,</HI> throughout.</NOTE>, and roundly denied any natural right to civil or military offices<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Page <HI>109.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e extravagant claims of &s;ome of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, in behalf of about twenty-five thou&s;and of their people, di&s;per&s;ed among a million or more of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who are &s;ettled between Nova-Scotia and Maryland, are very alarming; e&s;pecially as many of the epi&s;copal lately are utterly aver&s;e to the invidious &s;cheme. But the cour&s;e they take to obtain what they &s;eek for, by applying to England for an act of the &s;tate in their favour, is mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous, uncon&s;titutional, and &s;ubver&s;ive of liberty and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>How the&s;e enterpri&s;ing geniu&s;es came to be authori&s;ed to tran&s;|act for all Briti&s;h America, or at lea&s;t for all the epi&s;copalians in it, does not appear. It is very remarkable, the bu&s;tle about Bi&s;hops &s;eems to be confined to colonies generally &s;ettled by peo|ple aver&s;e to prelacy, in which <Q>it would, as Dr. Chandler him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, Page 47) without di&s;pute be improper to have any:</Q> whil&s;t in Virginia, and Maryland, where a nu|merous epi&s;copal Clergy are provided for under acts of a&s;&s;embly, and where the pleas of u&s;efulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity would have &s;ome meaning, there is little &s;aid concerning them. Doubtle&s;s if the people of tho&s;e provinces, who are generally friends to the epi&s;co|pal
<PB N="135" REF="010857_0068_0F851F89EE613310">Church, found it expedient to complete their religious e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, they would pa&s;s laws for the purpo&s;e, and carefully a&s;certain and limit the duties, privileges, and authority of the&s;e &s;piritual &s;uperiors; which from the peculiar circum&s;tances of the colonies; from the uncertainty of the law on this &s;ubject; but e&s;pecially from the encroaching di&s;po&s;ition which this order of men has &s;hewn in all Ages, would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If the propriety of e&s;tabli&s;hing dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops in the colonies was ever &s;o apparent and the right of parliament to interfere in our internal police ever &s;o clear, yet the coloni&s;ts would &s;carce think it prudent to have an affair &s;o delicate, and &s;o nearly con|nected with public liberty, regulated in England. The people there, very remotely intere&s;ted in the con&s;equences, would pro|bably leave it to the Clergy them&s;elves, to form the plan; as &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e, at the clo&s;e of Queen Ann's reign, when the de&s;ign of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing an American Epi&s;copate by act of parliament,</HI> was on the carpet before. But I hope we are not &s;o infatuated as willingly to tru&s;t this momentous affair to &s;uch intere&s;ted management. Let us then &s;peak and act for our&s;elves, and be watchful that our rights and privileges be not violated, under the &s;pecious pretence of advancing the intere&s;ts of religion.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Author of the American Whig, and Timothy Tickle <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his Gho&s;tly Flagellator.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Whig, when I read two or three of your fir&s;t papers I was &s;orry to &s;ee a &s;pirit ri&s;ing which tends to irritate and, inflame our brethren of the epi&s;copal Church: I &s;aid to my&s;elf, &s;urely the Gentleman is pouring his milk into the churn, and pre|paring to wring their no&s;es. Pray, Sir! con&s;ider what we fear is that our brethren of the epi&s;copal Church will fall into the &s;nare that is laid for them, by certain cunning politicians on the other &s;ide of the water, and become a detached party in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of the country, and a tool in their hands in oppre&s;|&s;ing the liberties of America. We ought to treat the epi&s;copa|lians with decency, le&s;t by provoking our brethren to wrath we induce them to run headlong into the &s;nare laid for them. This thought I am confirmed in, by the impre&s;&s;ion I find is made on their minds by your fir&s;t papers. Tickle is all in a flame, and la&s;hes every one he meets in his way, and brandi&s;hes his whip in a very furious manner.</P>
<P>As for you cou&s;in Tim, I take the liberty to &s;peak a word or two in your ear, tho' I expect you will give me a la&s;h of your
<PB N="136" REF="010857_0069_0F851F8AA2257868">whip for it, you have a&s;&s;umed a fal&s;e name; I know you well, by your whips; as the Philo&s;opher &s;aid, "&s;peak that I may know, you;" your true name is not Tickle, but <HI>Scratch'em.</HI> You have got an ugly pair of claws. If you can't keep your hands off from them, you ought to have your claws cut. As to the title of " <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>" with which you honour your&s;elf, it is a mere piece of vanity in you, I take you to be one of tho&s;e di&s;orderly Mi&s;&s;iona|ries, Dr. Chandler &s;peaks of, and &s;ays they want two or three &s;tout Bi&s;hops, from home, to govern them and give them due "Ca&s;tigation."</P>
<P>You are &s;oon angry, and your mouth calleth for &s;trokes: 'tis but a word and a blow with you, if your Bi&s;hop was here now, he would give you due "flagellation" for this. You and Mr. Whig both &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to tell certain ugly &s;tories about your holy mothers, and great grand fathers you proceed, I expect to hear one of you &s;aying to the other, <Q>your mother is a tyrant whore;</Q> and the other replying, your mother is a ba&s;tard, a hyprocrite and a fanatic. I advi&s;e you both to forbear and be &s;ilent. It is not prudent for the pot to call the kettle ugly names. If you mu&s;t have a thorough &s;cold, go out into the field, as cho|lorick Gentlemen do with their &s;words, and &s;cold it out between your&s;elves; but don't di&s;turb the publick peace, by brawling in the &s;treets&mdash;I recommend to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, the ju&s;t and amiable character which an ancient writer gives of the true wi&s;dom which is from above. To walk in her &s;teps is true policy, and be&s;t &s;erves every valuable intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I would that all the hot, angry, party Men, and narrow big|goted zealots, on all &s;ides, would altogether hold their peace: it would be their wi&s;dom. If the greate&s;t and be&s;t man that ever lived was now in America, he would &s;ay to them, "If ye have bitter zeal and &s;trife in your hearts ye are carnal; and if ye bite and devour each other, like angry dogs fallen together by the ears, take heed le&s;t ye be con&s;umed one of another." The fiery zeal|ots of all &s;ides would do well, in their lucid intervals, to con&s;ider that the ferments they are rai&s;ing, in their wrathful folly, threaten the de&s;truction of American liberty and honour. When the Prince of Orange, Britain's deliverer, was cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea with his fleet, bringing &s;alvation, he was a&s;&s;aulted by a furious &s;torm. As he &s;at in the great cabbin with &s;ome of his Officers, at mid|night, the Dutch pilot at helm, was heard repeatedly to cry out, "&s;teady,! &s;teady!" the prince reply'd, <Q>If my father of England had been as wi&s;e as this hone&s;t tar, I &s;hould not have been ex|po&s;ed to this &s;torm.</Q></P>

Avowedly to have &s;own the &s;eeds of di&s;affection, between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies, might have &s;ubjected them to &s;ome inconveniencies.

Some &s;ymptoms and indications of this de&s;ign, were noted by con&s;iderate people,

<P>This whole plea of con&s;cience is ridiculed by the <HI>American Whig.</HI> He cannot &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Churhman</HI> to be governed by con|&s;cience in any thing, I mu&s;t therefore conclude, that he is utterly unacquainted with the force of con&s;cience <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> and that, of con&s;equence, he is always ready, whenever it is in his power, to <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> tho&s;e, who he &s;uppo&s;es, are not <HI>governed</HI> by con&s;cience, but are carrying on a horrid de&s;ign of ruining and en&s;laving the country, by bringing in a "Bi&s;hop" as a &s;py,"&mdash;"a mini&s;ter of the church" "as much to be dreaded as a late mini&s;ter of &s;tate."</P>

But if the <HI>Whig</HI> will need &s;uppo&s;e that poverty, di&s;tre&s;s and per&s;ecution, are e&s;&s;ential to the character of a primitive Bi&s;hop; it is more than probable, that the <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops will be <HI>lite|rally</HI> primitive. No revenues, no one &s;ingle worldly advantage, has been a&s;ked for them; and the <HI>Whig</HI> is laying up in &s;tore a good <HI>magazine of per&s;ecutions again their arrival.</HI></P>
<P>If it plea&s;ed God, that the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hould make its way into the world, thro' the poverty, reproach, per&s;ecution and death of the fir&s;t preachers of it, that his power might the more con&s;picuou&s;ly appear in its e&s;tabli&s;hment; no good rea&s;on can there be drawn to &s;hew why a man, who from a &s;incere de&s;ire to &s;erve God in his Church, and to qualify him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e, has &s;pent his little fortune in his education, and in an expen&s;ive voyage of a thou&s;and leagues for ordination, &s;hould not live de|cently and comfortably upon the income of his Pari&s;h.

<P>The education of a lawyer is not more expen&s;ive, than that of a Clergyman; the profe&s;&s;ion requires no greater abilities,&mdash;no greater labour; nor is it, that I know of, either more honoura|ble or more u&s;eful.

<P>"I Have read the letter you &s;ent me, from Mr, Living&s;ton to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff with particular plea&s;ure.

<P>"In civil affairs the times have been &s;uch, of late, that bad, very bad men have found their way up to tho&s;e in power by the mo&s;t infamous mi&s;repre&s;entations of the wealth, loyalty, and go|vernment of this country; and I fear the Epi&s;copal Clergy, catch|ing the ca&s;t of the times, are falling too much into the &s;ame

As to the former I believe, it is now pretty near high|water with them, and upon the turn of the tide, I am not with|out expectation that public di&s;grace, if not exemplary puni&s;hment will follow. A prime mini&s;ter, (even Mr. G.) may &s;tand unim|peachable, &s;hould he be able to lay upon the table the opinions and earne&s;t reccommendations of the fir&s;t order of people that the crown knows in this country, in favour of taxation, and ev'ry other &s;evere mea&s;ure that has been taken, in con&s;equence of the rebellious colours Americans have been painted in. The manner in which our Clergy, (for I am a Churchman) aim at &s;tealing a Bi&s;hop into America, is low; and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that Mr. Living&s;ton's letter may put the Bi&s;hop of Landaff upon review|ing his authorities for the &s;tate that he has given the public of this country: and I think <HI>He</HI> will &s;tand in &s;ome mea&s;ure excul|pated, &s;hould he be able to give the &s;ociety's <HI>mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> as vouchers for the &s;entiments that he has thrown out.

Dr. Tillot&s;on whom I admire in all his writings, and who has done &s;o much honour to the church of England by his moderation, candour, and good &s;en&s;e, &s;ays in one of his &s;ermons, <HI>&s;ome men have a &s;curvy trick of lying for the honour and glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>I would be under&s;tood to think that the government at home, both in church and &s;tate, had no premeditated de&s;ign to injure this country, but they have been mo&s;t &s;hamefully and gro&s;sly im|pos'd upon in the repre&s;entations they have receiv'd, and from &s;uch quarters, as they had a right to expect <HI>pure facts only.</HI> And let me whi&s;per a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation to Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> that &s;uch a &s;ort of Bi&s;hop as he has &s;ketched out for America, without his full &s;uit of power and glory would by no means an&s;wer the Doctor's purpo&s;es.&mdash;It would be like the young gentleman, who for the &s;ake of being in bed with his mi&s;tre&s;s, con&s;ented to be &s;waithed round with a whole piece of new linnen, but was afterwards very re&s;tle&s;s indeed, and &s;omewhat impatient of his confinement."</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE. May 16, 1768. THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. X]</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE engaged in this cour&s;e of periodical papers, as an ad|vocate for the general liberties of my fellow &s;ubjects in North-America. I have entered upon the que&s;tion of an American epi&s;copate, and a con&s;ideration of Doctor <HI>Chandler's appeal to the public,</HI> in favour of it; as I e&s;teem the que&s;tion to be of greater importance, in its con&s;equences, to my native country, than the impo&s;ition of any cu&s;toms, or commercial re&s;trictions. which affect not the right of con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="010857_0073_0F851F8DAAA82698">
The Doctor addre&s;&s;es the public, with an air of the highe&s;t a&s;&s;urance, of the propriety and expediency of his plan; and, with de&s;ign no doubt, to engage his &s;uperiors in the immediate pro&s;e|cution of it, very &s;hrewdly in&s;inuates, that the apprehen&s;ion of any general popular di&s;content or oppo&s;ition, is entirely groundle&s;s. <Q>Of any con&s;iderable di&s;content or unea&s;ine&s;s, (&s;ays he,) there is no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive. Whatever notions the di&s;&s;enters of this country may have formerly entertained, concerning the church: yet of late years they have greatly come off from their prejudices&mdash;excepting here and their a hot-headed writer, or a pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;t.</Q> So al&s;o to prejudice unwary minds, again&s;t any pre&s;umptuous opponents, he anticipates his clerical anathemas of every objection, <Q>that may be hereafter &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t American Bi&s;hops,</Q> as <Q>proofs rather of the dexterity or ill-will of the inventors, than of the real fears and unea&s;ine&s;s of the inhabitants&mdash;that artful men may rai&s;e objections, in a way that &s;hall appear plau&s;ible to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the legerdemain of cavillers and &s;ophi&s;ts.</Q> And that "whoever employs his talents in this exerci&s;e," that is, gentle reader, of offering any objections to his darling epi&s;copate, <Q>is as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages at crambo or pu&s;h-pin.</Q> This reader, is the language of the celebrated Doctor <HI>Chandler,</HI> who&s;e fame for ingenuity and can|dour, has of late, been &s;o much trumpetted by his brethren of the Clergy. The&s;e are the candid and ingenuous remarks of our reverend appellant; who, in the introduction of his appeal, with &s;o much &s;eeming fairne&s;s, had even invited objections, that <Q>they might be fairly and candidly debated, before the tribunal of the public.</Q> Did the Doctor hope, by thus previou&s;ly thunder|ing his pontifical bull, to &s;ilence all oppo&s;ition? Or, forgetting his &s;ituation, before the impartial bar of the public, did he now conceive him&s;elf in a &s;piritual court, and his cau&s;e in the deci&s;ion of an epi&s;copal judge, where the <HI>verbum &s;acerdotis</HI> would have all the influence he could wi&s;h; where, to gain his point his &s;ingle a&s;&s;ertion, again&s;t the te&s;timony of twenty laies, might po&s;&s;ible be &s;ufficient,&mdash;that there <Q>neither now is, or ever has been, any con&s;iderable noi&s;e or public clamour,</Q> on the expectation of an American epi&s;copate,&mdash;that, <Q>of any con&s;iderable di&s;content and unea&s;ine&s;s, there is no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive;</Q> and that all &s;ugge&s;tions to the contrary, proceed merely from the <HI>malevo|lence</HI> of <Q>here and there, a hot-headed writer, or pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>As to any "public clamour upon this account," before the public had been informed of the &s;even famous petitions, and the united attempts of the clergy, to introduce bi&s;hops into this
<PB N="145" REF="010857_0073_0F851F8DAAA82698">country; perhaps the Doctor had not "heard of any", nor, per|haps, did he "fore&s;ee any." But I may now appeal to him&s;elf, whether, &s;ince the publication of his appeal; a very general unea&s;ine&s;s is not vi&s;ible among the people; and a general popular oppo&s;ition expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t his epi&s;copal project, among all ranks of men, as they become daily more diffu&s;ively acquainted with the reality of the de&s;ign. The Doctor will unque&s;tionably find him&s;elf gro&s;sly mi&s;taken, in his opinion of the tame acquie&s;cence of the inhabitants. And, if the zealous opponents of his American epi&s;copate, merit the genteel appellation of "noi&s;y hot-heads, and pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;ts," he will hear of not a few &s;uch, among the lay members of his own communion. Let him look into the dominion of Virginia, where, it our information may be depended upon, the laity of the church of England, are warm|ly, and almo&s;t univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed to it. And I am per&s;uaded, that &s;hould the voices of the epi&s;copalians only, be fairly collected throughout the colonies, there would be found a majority, decla|ring their aver&s;ion to the project of introducing the Engli&s;h eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy into America. Should any Briti&s;h mini&s;try therefore be found &s;o weak, or &s;o corrupt, as to betray the true intere&s;t, and di&s;regard the tranquility of the provinces, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;piritual lord&s;hips; for my part, I &s;hould con|ceive no &s;cene more likely to open, than &s;uch a one as we have recently &s;een; I mean the conduct of the populace with re&s;pect to the officers appointed under the late unpopular &s;tatute: Nor would I be an&s;werable for the &s;afety of the able&s;t prelate that ever wore a mitre, was he to arrive in this country, under the charac|ter of a <HI>Prote&s;tant American Bi&s;hop.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ooth the public into a favourable opinion of, and quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;piritual yoke, the Doctor a&s;&s;ures them, that really nothing more is de&s;igned than a mere primitive epi&s;copacy, &s;tripped of all its temporal and adventitious appendages, and without <HI>any authority derived from the &s;tate.</HI> This is the pre|tended fundamental argument for the appeal, for this American epi&s;copal &s;uper&s;tructure;&mdash; <Q>It has long been &s;ettled (&s;ays he) by <HI>our friends and &s;uperiors</HI> at home, and the Clergy of this country have often &s;ignified their entire approbation and acquie&s;cence therein, that the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, will have no authority but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal nature, &s;uch as is <HI>derived altogether from the church, and not from the &s;tate.</HI></Q> And for the truth of this declaration, the Doctor appeals to every reader, "who is accquainted with the matter." If by "friends and &s;uperiors at home," he means the mini&s;try and government, I mu&s;t, in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n appeal to every man, who has the lea&s;t acquaintance with the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mother-country, for the fal&s;ity of it? as
<PB N="146" REF="010857_0074_0F851F8E73A8E250">no &s;uch &s;y&s;tem ever has or can be adopted by the Briti&s;h govern|ment, in any con&s;i&s;tency with its con&s;titutional principles. It by "friends and &s;uperiors," he means the dignified clergy of the Church of England, his declaration is as idle as their plan is chimerical, as neither can have the lea&s;t weight or operation, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature to be entirely at the will and plea&s;ure of their &s;piritual lord&s;hips: or, that they will &s;trike at the fundamental principles of the political machine, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point; and thereby rai&s;e a ferment among the commons of England, as well as America, merely to gratify the de&s;ires of the clergy. Therefore if the grand ba&s;is of the Appeal be found chimerical and ab&s;urd, the &s;uper&s;tructure will nece&s;&s;arily fall. If his lord&s;hip of America is to have <Q>no other authority but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is de|rived altogether from the church, and not from the &s;tate; and even this power is only to operate upon the clergy, and not on the laity,</Q> whence in the name of common &s;en&s;e, the propriety of this long Appeal! the&s;e pathetical addre&s;&s;es to the public? Whence the&s;e terrible outcries of <HI>partiality, per&s;ecution,</HI> and <HI>un|parallel'd hard&s;hips,</HI> &s;ufficient to excite the pity of every church in Chri&s;tendom? Is not all the power here contended for, in the hands of the clergy them&s;elves? Why is the civil government called upon to interpo&s;e? Did ever any mini&s;ter of the church of England receive the lea&s;t mole&s;tation in the exerci&s;e of his cleri|cal office in any part of America? have not commi&s;&s;aries been heretofore appointed in different places, and have they not always been treated in a manner, worthy their &s;acred character?&mdash; If "no authority is to be derived from the &s;tate," for what pur|po&s;e is the &s;tate applied to, and &s;o pathetically folicited? And why the&s;e prote&s;tations of being "con&s;cious of no crimes with regard to the &s;tate?" If none are to be affected but the clergy, why are the laity addre&s;&s;ed with all this warmth of expo&s;tulation, and &s;eeming vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion? Amid&s;t all this &s;trange incon|&s;i&s;tency and jargon, the world will &s;u&s;pect &s;ome unavowed ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical machinations; and that tho' <HI>the voice may be Jacob's voice, yet the hands are the hands of E&s;au.</HI></P>
<P>But let us, for argument's &s;ake, &s;uppo&s;e the plan to be carried into execution, and an act of parliament obtained for the creation of an American Bi&s;hop, upon &s;uch anti-con&s;titutional principles, dive&s;ting his lord&s;hip of all the temporal powers belonging to the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate&mdash;What, in this ca&s;e, would be the natural reflections of our fellow &s;ubjects, the inhabitants of South-Britain, on &s;o &s;trange a production?&mdash;Would they not have rea&s;on for &s;uch reflections as the&s;e&mdash; <Q>The Americans are a people tenaci|ous of their liberty; who have &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed the in|troduction of bi&s;hops, as political per&s;ons dangerous to their
<PB N="147" REF="010857_0074_0F851F8E73A8E250">civil and religious privileges. Our parliament have now im|plicitly acknowledged this; and in favour of American liberty, have deprived their Bi&s;hops of all temporal juri&s;diction; and con|fined them &s;olely to "the exerci&s;e of the original powers of their office" in the Chri&s;tian church. If fellow &s;ubjects are thus indulged with an exemption from eccle&s;ia&s;tical dominion, why ought we to remain &s;hackled with a yoke, which we and our fa|thers have &s;o hardly borne?</Q>&mdash;it is plain, the Doctor takes it for granted, that the temporal powers of the Engli&s;h hierarchy, are not to be admitted here, as incompatible with the civil and religious rights of the community. What would be the con&s;e|quence of &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, among the commons of Eng|land? Would any mini&s;ter e&s;pou&s;e a mea&s;ure, that might have a tendency to excite &s;uch reflections? For, tho,' the pretence of di&s;burdening the mother country, by a taxation of her American children, might blind the eyes of the populace to their true in|tere&s;ts, and lead them to approve an injurious Stamp-Act; yet in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, there could be no &s;uch pretence, and they might &s;oon cry out for the like indulgence. And can it be thought probably, that the dignify'd clergy them&s;elves would willingly &s;uffer a continual acknowledgment of an anti-chri&s;tian power, as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy&mdash;incon&s;i&s;tent with that fundamental maxim of the great founder of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>my kingdom is not of this world?</HI> Are the&s;e gentlemen at once become to mortified to worldly grandeur, worldly power, and worldly a&s;&s;luence, as to wi&s;h for a di&s;&s;olution of that dignity and authority, in the epi&s;copal order here, which they are them&s;elves exerci&s;ing every day?&mdash;'Tis a ridiculous pretence not to be impo&s;ed upon an American under&s;tanding, even by the <Q>plau&s;ible arts and legerdemain of <HI>clerical</HI> &s;ophi&s;try.</Q></P>
<P>But can any &s;en&s;ible American imagine, that his liberty or proper|ty would be long &s;ecure, even &s;hould Bi&s;hops be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, in the very harmle&s;s character pretended. From whence would their gentlene&s;s proceed? Not from want of inclination to exerci&s;e the powers of the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate&mdash;but from the re&s;traint of an act of parliament&mdash;an act, which being pa&s;&s;ed in direct repugnancy to the con&s;titution, and rendering the A|merican, independent of the Engli&s;h e&s;tabii&s;hment; would &s;oon be found to be incon&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t &s;y&s;tem of politics: Nor would ecle&s;ia&s;tical policy fail to &s;et every engine at work, for the abolition of an act &s;o invidions in it&s;elf, and derogatory to the epi&s;copal character. And would their American lord&s;hips, upon their full inve&s;titure with the con&s;titutional powers of the epi&s;co|pal office, in Chri&s;tian renderne&s;s to the laity here, refu&s;e to exer|ci&s;e them, or return to their native country? No, &s;urely; but rather would they not piou&s;ly adopt, with a little variation, the

In &s;hort, In &s;pite of the affect|ed moderation of this wretched &s;cribbler, there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, he is at heart a favourer of the doctrines of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedi|ence,</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> and that (&s;o &s;lavi&s;h are his principles) he would have made a very con&s;i&s;tent appearance in <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s pulpit.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, May 19th. <HI>The</HI> CENTINEL. No. IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE abu&s;e of power, has in all ages, furni&s;hed the mo&s;t co|pious fund of materials to the morali&s;t, and to the hi&s;torian, and has ever given the greate&s;t perplexity to the Legi&s;lator. Private per&s;ons doubtle&s;s affect the public weal by their vices and by their crimes, but &s;tanding &s;ingly and alone, their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions are ea&s;ily corrected. Whereas tho&s;e who by the advan|tages of birth, fortune, office, or &s;uperior abilities are enabled to influence others, and to direct the public views and councils, are not without difficulty and addre&s;s kept within the bounds of law and ju&s;tice. The pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of men are con&s;tantly leading them into one mi&s;take or another; and the remon&s;trances of rea&s;on and duty alone, are but feeble re&s;traints. In order therefore to curb the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of leading men it hath been found expedient to di&s;tribute the powers of government among the different, &s;orts and orders of which the community is compo&s;ed, &s;o as to excite, and employ tho&s;e of one rank and intere&s;t, to correct the irregularities of another.</P>
<P>Although this may &s;eem to lay a foundation for con&s;tant debate and faction, yet even this is a &s;mall inconvenience compared to
<PB N="154" REF="010857_0078_0F851F916F08FC30">the galling and oppre&s;&s;ive yoke of ab&s;olute monarchy; or even the jealous &s;everity of an ari&s;tocratic &s;enate. But the common di&s;advantages of the mixed forms of government, will be found neither very con&s;iderable nor la&s;ting, in ca&s;e the di&s;tribution of power is made with judgment. The old Roman policy was defi|cient in this re&s;pect. The patrician and plebeian orders in that republic, wanted a third e&s;tate to moderate between them: which defect the king in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution admirably &s;upplies; whil&s;t our popular branch, acting by repre&s;entatives, their a&s;&s;em|blies are more deliberate, and le&s;s factious, than at Rome, where the people appeared in per&s;on.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the Briti&s;h colonies, ju&s;t ri&s;ing out of the difficulties of an infant &s;tate, do not admit of &s;uch a regular di|&s;tribution of power. To forward the full &s;ettlement of a new country, &s;uch a divi&s;ion, and diffu&s;ion of the lands is nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;hall leave the profits wholly in the hands of tho&s;e who cultivate them. Hence our laws for making partition of real e&s;tates among all the children of the family; and for the ready &s;ale of lands to &s;atisfy debts, equitable in them&s;elves, are even political in &s;uch a country as this: but they render the ri&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment of an upper rank among us, difficult, if not impracticable.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things it behoves the people of North-America, to con&s;ider fully what political con&s;equences and effects the intro|duction of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops among them may produce. By Dr. Chandler's account of them, as &s;mooth as he writes, we find they are not to be mere voluntary bi&s;hops, &s;uch as the Moravian church has, but prelates commi&s;&s;ioned by his maje&s;ty, as &s;upreme heads of the church, and authori&s;ed by the nation, as branching from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment in England. Nor are the&s;e Ame|rican bi&s;hops to be &s;uffered to tarni&s;h the &s;plendor of their bre|thren at home, by being left to the precarious maintainance of the epi&s;copalians here; as was the ca&s;e in the primitive times of the Chri&s;tian church. But thou&s;ands of pounds &s;terling have been laying up and accumulating at intere&s;t, for above half a century pa&s;t, as a &s;und for &s;upporting one or two of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Chandler from recollection, in&s;tances in &s;ix gifts or lega|cies, &s;ome of them of <HI>50</HI> years &s;tanding, which amounts to &pound; <HI>4500</HI> &s;terling; doubtle&s;s there are many &s;maller ones. The&s;e having been at intere&s;t, mu&s;t now make a very con&s;iderable fund; of which about &pound;. <HI>826</HI> only appear to have been expended for a hou&s;e at Bur|lington. See Appeal, pages <HI>108</HI> and <HI>50.</HI></NOTE> Be&s;ides this, it is intimated that many per&s;ons in England, &s;tand ready to con|tribute to this U&s;e, as &s;oon as the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eme &s;hall be put in execution. Hereafter, great matters may be expected from the crown lands, which it is propo&s;ed to &s;et apart for the benefit of the American
<PB N="155" REF="010857_0078_0F851F916F08FC30">hierarchy: but till the further &s;ettlement and improvement of the colonies, &s;hall rai&s;e the&s;e to a proper value, <HI>"the general tax on the country,"</HI> which Dr. Chandler &s;peaks of, page 107, may &s;up|ply all deficiencies.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme of the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries and their patrons, the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, whatever they intend by it, would be likely to have great influence on civil government and public liberty; and therefore, whether we con&s;ider the thing it|&s;elf, or the method taken to obtain it, our mo&s;t &s;erious attention cannot but be awakened on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In their zeal for their hierarchy, the&s;e gentlemen, po&s;&s;ibly, have not con&s;idered what they are about, in this view. Or if any of them have glanced &s;o much be&s;ide their own concernments, as to have perceived the obvious effects of their propo&s;al on political affairs, they may have reconciled to them&s;elves the pur&s;uit of &s;o dangerous a mea&s;ure, by the pro&s;pect of the &s;piritual advantage they expect will flow from it.</P>
<P>For my part, I have often e&s;teemed it a great advantage to the northern colonies, that their clergy have very little weight in go|vernment. This is owing to the moderate &s;alaries paid them; to their debates and divi&s;ions about the modes and circum&s;tantials of religion; and to the want of general connection among them|&s;elves, and with the churches e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain. By their di&s;&s;entions, we are &s;ecured from the u&s;urpations and encroachments they might otherwi&s;e make as a body: for one denomination care|fully watches another, and &s;ounds the alarm on occa&s;ion of any &s;chemes that may be devi&s;ed to the prejudice of the public. This al&s;o keeps up a &s;pirit of free-inquiry and prevents the ill effects of a fond &s;uper&s;titious credulity.</P>
<P>But here is a mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, that directly tends to form and combine this order of men into a regular and powerful band; and to put them under the direction of &s;uperior officers, inve&s;ted with great powers over the re&s;t. It is al&s;o calculated to connect them by uniformity, e&s;tabli&s;hment and intere&s;t with the church e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in England.</P>
<P>It was formerly propo&s;ed that the clergy, on account of their wealth and influence, &s;hould be con&s;idered as a fourth e&s;tate in parliament, but this happily did not take place.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gilbert,</HI> on the Exah. <HI>48.</HI></NOTE> Among us, they mu&s;t be much more than a &s;eperate e&s;tate; they can have no equals in the colonies. Whil&s;t for civil government the Briti&s;h dominions on the continent are already divided into &s;eventeen provinces, the epi&s;copal elergy (who may before long by pro|per management, and the aid of acts of parliament, be augment|ed to three or four thou&s;and in number) will be collected and di&s;|ciplined
<PB N="156" REF="010857_0079_0F851F9236102620">under twenty or more bi&s;hops, and a primate appointed from home. What re&s;traint and check will there be on the views and &s;chemes of a body &s;o well compacted, &s;o weighty, &s;o well e|&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;tatute, and &s;o well allied to powerful hierarchies in Europe. Without an order of nobility to &s;tand on equal footing with the prelates; without courts of common law, of juri&s;diction exten&s;ive enough to i&s;&s;ue prohibitions and correct the proceedings of the arch-bi&s;hop and his &s;uffragans, when they exceed their proper limits; as the &s;piritual courts in England frequently do; without a general a&s;&s;embly of the colonies, or other a&s;&s;ociation for civil purpo&s;es, in what circum&s;tances mu&s;t the laity be to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the ambitious de&s;igns of the &s;piritual power? In &s;hort they mu&s;t lie entirely at the mercy and moderation of the clergy: and what the&s;e are, let Spain, let Italy, let the hi&s;tory of England, in the papal times, and even &s;ince the reformation, under the government of the hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart,</HI> picture out to the reader.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>It hath been a great mi&s;take among us, that the popi&s;h reli|gion is the only one, of all Chri&s;tian &s;ects, proper to introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h Slavery.&mdash;Other religions have &s;ucceeded as effectu|ally as ever popery did.</Q> Lord <HI>Mole&s;worth</HI>'s Account of <HI>Denmark:</HI> He in&s;tances in that kingdom; yet he ob&s;erves the &s;uper-intendants or Bi&s;hops there have no Temporalties, nor any Power over the other Clergy; being only <HI>Primi-inter pares,</HI> Fir&s;t among Equals.</NOTE> Men in all ages and of every character are much the &s;ame in regard to the u&s;e of power; and their conduct when they get above controul, loudly proclaims the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the proper di&s;tribution of it in every free government, that would pre&s;erve its con&s;titution.</P>

<P>&mdash;"HAVE you &s;een Dr. Chandler's pamphlet, in favour of American bi&s;hops? We are told that prelacy is become quite generous and inoffen&s;ive, but a late in&s;tance &s;hould put our church on their guard. Our's at New-York, lately a&s;k|ed the king for a charter, to &s;ave our e&s;tates from falling into private hands, and the bones and &s;epulchres of our ance&s;tors from being &s;old.

<P>NOT many years ago, were tran&s;mitted to the public, thro' the channel of the Bo&s;ton Gazette, a &s;ew de&s;ultory e&s;&s;ays, on the &s;pirit of the cannon and feudal law: in &s;ome of which were expre&s;&s;ed apprehen&s;ions of the future mi&s;chiefs, that might be cau&s;ed in America by the efforts and exertions of tho&s;e expiring and dete&s;ted &s;y&s;tems. That tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions were too well founded, time has, already, &s;ufficiently &s;hewn: and we have now, perhaps, &s;tronger rea&s;ons to fear, a &s;till further increa&s;e of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs, than we had then. It is therefore the opinion of ma|ny per&s;ons, who wi&s;h well to the religion, the learning, the liber|ty and happine&s;s of this injured and in&s;ulted country, that a re|a&s;&s;umption of that inexhau&s;tile &s;ubject, would not be improper, at the pre&s;ent juncture. And it is, without any further apology, propo&s;ed, to continue a &s;eries of di&s;&s;ertations upon that and &s;imi|lar &s;ubjects, for &s;ome months, if not years to come. It is claimed as an inconte&s;tible right to pur&s;ue our own plan, method and &s;tyle: and, if in the cour&s;e of our lucubrations, we &s;hould depart from the rules of e&s;tabli&s;hed logicians and rhetoricians, if we &s;hould &s;ometimes in ha&s;te throw our thoughts together in rude heaps, if a few blunders and &s;oleci&s;ms &s;hould e&s;cape us, or if we &s;hould now and then mi&s;-&s;pell and mi&s;-point, we &s;hall not think it worth our while to engage in any contention, concerning &s;uch matters, with the little &s;cribblers, and paltry critics, who&s;e ambition never a&s;pired, and who&s;e capacity never attained to greater objects.&mdash; Our labours will be interrupted whenever the paroxi&s;ms of the gout or the &s;pleen, the fits of dulne&s;s or lazine&s;s, or the avocati|ons of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement &s;hall make an interruption expedient.

In this country, the members of tho&s;e churches have ever copied the good di&s;po&s;ition of their brethren at home, and have lived together in the greate&s;t harmony.&mdash;That the church of <HI>Holland,</HI> is not epi&s;copal exactly in the &s;ame manner that the church of <HI>England</HI> is epi&s;copal, is readily admitted;&mdash;neither is it <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that the <HI>Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters are Presbyterian,</HI> as is evident from the di&s;tinction that, <HI>I am told,</HI> in
<PB N="160" REF="010857_0081_0F851F93D30EFF70">made in their ordination of a member of the <HI>cla&s;&s;is,</HI> and an ordina|ry pa&s;tor or pre&s;byter. When a member of the cla&s;&s;is is ordained, the powers of ordination and government are committed to him; but when an ordinary pa&s;tor is ordained, no &s;uch powers are con|ferred on him, but only the powers of preaching the word and admini&s;tering the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>National churches have a right to judge for them&s;elves, with regard to the <HI>modes</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> of religion, &s;o that <HI>all things be done decently and in order.</HI> And the church of <HI>England,</HI> no more cen&s;ures the church of <HI>Holland,</HI> becau&s;e it is not <HI>epi&s;copal exactly like it&s;elf,</HI> than the civil government of <HI>England</HI> quarrels with that of <HI>Holland,</HI> becau&s;e it is not <HI>monarchial.</HI> Every true Engli&s;hman e&s;teems the civil government of his own country the mo&s;t <HI>perfect</HI> on earth; and of con&s;equence mu&s;t think the ci|vil government of <HI>Holland</HI> le&s;s perfect, without <HI>ungovernmenting that government.</HI> In like manner the members of the church of <HI>England,</HI> may think their own church more <HI>perfect,</HI> and that of <HI>Holland,</HI> le&s;s <HI>perfect,</HI> without <HI>unchurching that church.</HI></P>
<P>But if the <HI>American Whig</HI> would know who they are who are <HI>unchurching</HI> the church of <HI>Holland</HI> in this country let him attend to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who for many years have ca&s;t a longing look at the reve|nues of the <HI>Dutch</HI> church in <HI>New-York;</HI> who have u&s;ed every art to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auch its members from their fidelity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to convert their churches into conventicles for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> independents.&mdash;Why all this <HI>begging, demanding, coax|ing, threatning, cringing, bullying, whining, blu&s;tering, intreating, bellowing for a charter,</HI> to incorporate a thing by law and by na|ture <HI>incorporatable,</HI> called a <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> but to put them&s;elves into a capacity of covering iniquity by law;&mdash;into a legal capacity of holding the revenues of the <HI>Dutch</HI> church, when once they could lay their griping paw upon them.&mdash;Tho&s;e are the people who are <HI>unchurching</HI> the church of <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> church in <HI>New-York;</HI> &mdash;who <HI>Ahab like,</HI> fir&s;t <HI>kill,</HI> and then <HI>take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;</HI> fir&s;t &s;ow divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities among the members of that church by which its very exi&s;tence is to be <HI>annihilated,</HI> that they may en|ter upon their vineyard;&mdash;and then like the whori&s;h women de|&s;cribed by <HI>Solomon</HI> in his Proverbs, they will <HI>wipe their mouth, and &s;ay we have done no harm.</HI></P>
<P>To an&s;wer the &s;ame <HI>pious purpo&s;e,</HI> of ca&s;ting an odium upon the church, &s;he is repre&s;ented by the <HI>American Whig</HI> as being in|clined to popery; becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Houdin</HI> was admitted to officiate as a clergyman, without <HI>re-ordination.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Houdin,</HI> it is true, was born and educated in the popi&s;h religion, and ordained by a popi&s;h bi&s;hop in <HI>France;</HI> he left <HI>Canada,</HI> and came to <HI>New-York,</HI> where after &s;ome time, he openly in the face of the congregation in Trinity-church, in this city, renounced and abjured the errors
<PB N="161" REF="010857_0081_0F851F93D30EFF70">of popery, and was admitted to officiate in <HI>the church without re|ordination.</HI></P>
<P>I would here beg the candid reader to ob&s;erve, that epi&s;copal ordination is not looked upon as one of the <HI>errors</HI> of popery, ei|ther by the <HI>Lutheran, Dani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> churches, any more than by the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>England;</HI>&mdash;con&s;equently no particular <HI>odi|um</HI> ought to lie again&s;t the church on this account.&mdash;Again, if Mr. <HI>Houdin</HI>'s ordination in <HI>France,</HI> was &s;ufficiently valid to con|fer the powers of the Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood, there was no nee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of re-ordaining him. If Mr. <HI>Houdin</HI> had embraced the religion of the <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI>&mdash;(what the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> name of this religion is I know not; formerly it was <HI>independent,</HI> &s;ince, <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> and now it &s;eems to be aping the denomination of, <HI>church;</HI>) of the <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> I &s;ay, and had <HI>there</HI> renounced all the <HI>error<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of popery,</HI> would they have re-ordained him;&mdash;if not, why this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|mour again&s;t the Church?</P>
<P>If God &s;aw good to pre&s;erve to us, the holy &s;criptures and &s;a|craments of the Chri&s;tian church, through the corrupt medium of popery, why not the Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood thro' the &s;ame medium?&mdash; If the Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood was not pre&s;erved in the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> it is extinct in the we&s;tern world. Upon this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, I beg the <HI>American Whig</HI> to try his abilities,&mdash;and he may take all the a&s;&s;ociations, con-&s;ociations, pre&s;byteries and &s;ynods, on the continent, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the leathern mitten of <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ram-Chicken</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> into the Bargain,&mdash;in fabricating a &s;ingle <HI>Chri&s;tian prie&s;t;</HI> pardon the word, good Mr. <HI>Whig, Pre&s;byter</HI> if you had rather;&mdash;</P>
<P>Another fountain of odium which our <HI>meek &s;pirited Whig,</HI> who &s;eems not in the lea&s;t <HI>tainted</HI> with the virtue of <HI>Chri&s;tian charity,</HI> has opened again&s;t the Church, is the imputation of a <HI>per&s;ecu|ting</HI> &s;pirit.

<P>When arguments fail, <HI>po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions</HI> are ready at hand for the u&s;e of our <HI>Whig,</HI> by which he has proved over and over, that the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops are by <HI>nature,</HI> by <HI>education,</HI> by <HI>principle,</HI> by <HI>practice, per&s;ecutors;</HI>&mdash;by the &s;ame kind of rea&s;oning, he now again for the &s;econd or third time, <HI>proves</HI> it to be <Q>impo&s;&s;ible, as <HI>the law now &s;tands,</HI> to introduce a bi&s;hop into <HI>America,</HI> who will not have authority the in&s;tant he arrives, to &s;et up an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical court,</Q> &amp;c.

For it is the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the friends of an American epi&s;copate, to <HI>obtain &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing to them&s;elves without any detriment to others;</HI>&mdash;they are willing to come to any <HI>rea&s;onable terms to &s;atisfy all parties.</HI> But the <HI>thing it&s;elf, they never will give up.</HI> They will u&s;e all <HI>prudent, rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> means to obtain it. And if the <HI>American Whig,</HI> and his confederates, think to &s;top the mouths of the ad|vocates for American bi&s;hops, at all adventures, let them <HI>know,</HI> they mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t &s;top their breath; for while they live they will not be &s;ilent.</HI> Let the <HI>American Whig</HI> write on at the pre&s;ent rate, let

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is really a thing of very malancholy con&s;ideration to every &s;erious Chri&s;tian, and who truly loves his country, that &s;o un|charitable, and even malicious a &s;pirit, &s;o much the rever&s;e of the mo&s;t benevolent temper of the go&s;pel, &s;hould &s;o much obtain in this country, and be &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by the <HI>American Whig,</HI> to the utter de&s;truction of every thing that is plea&s;ant and amiable in &s;ociety; and this without any manner of provocation from Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> who only pleads the cau&s;e of liberty, with a Chri&s;tian temper, in an affair of great importance in religion and con&s;cience, on the &s;ide of the church, the enjoyment of which, if obtained, could not po&s;&s;ibly (as we de&s;ire it,) be of the lea&s;t detriment to any other denomination.&mdash;How can it be, that he &s;hould &s;o vehemently make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ow di&s;cord among brethren? For brethren we are, in &s;o far as we are fellow Chri&s;|tians and neighbours.&mdash;I am &s;orry, indeed, that any of the church &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves by however &s;o bitter obloquy, to be provoked to return any thing of the like kind, (tho' he makes it ten times as bad as it is,) but it is &s;aid, <HI>tread on a worm and it will turn,</HI> and I hope it will be excu&s;ed from the frailty of hu|man nature, e&s;pecially, when the provocation is &s;o very &s;evere.

<Q><P>&mdash;Brethren, who came in privily to &s;py out our Liberty, which we have in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that they might bring us into Bondage.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE clergy whenever opportunity has offered, have appeared as apt to pervert power as other people, and their conduct too plainly proves that "we have the trea&s;ure of religion conveyed "to us in earthen ve&s;&s;els:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Corinth.</HI> iv. 7.</NOTE> This &s;hould teach us to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully between the &s;chemes of ambitious eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and the true intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity. If this be forgotten, the laiety will &s;oon be reduced to &s;piritual thraldom, and the mini&s;ters of religi|on neglecting their proper duties, will become competitors with the magi&s;trate, for civil power.</P>
<P>The&s;e are far from being conjectures only; our own hi&s;tory, not to recur to tho&s;e of other nations, abounds with numerous in&s;tances of this temper in men, who are by profe&s;&s;ion, ab&s;tracted from worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. Even the Monks, who apparently re|nounced all intercour&s;e with &s;ociety and pretended to retire to cells and de&s;arts, could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of exerci&s;ing the exten|&s;ive
<PB N="167" REF="010857_0084_0F851F95E7B36FD8">influence, which their &s;anctified character among the credu|lous multitude, gave them.</P>
<P>In fact, this order has ever been found to con&s;i&s;t of &s;peculative men, clear-&s;ighted to their own intere&s;ts, adhering clo&s;ely toge|ther, and pur&s;uing their views with &s;teadine&s;s. As an incorpo|rate body that never dies, they build for ages, and their fabricks almo&s;t always affect, often endanger the welfare of the &s;tate. The large revenues, Privileges, immunities and juri&s;dictions, which they claimed and exerci&s;ed in the days of popery, rendering them formidable to the civil magi&s;trate, and inve&s;ted with exce&s;&s;ive powers a body of men, who never want a plau&s;ible pretence for making further u&s;urpations. That &s;y&s;tem had indeed been the work of many dark ages, when the ignorance, barbari&s;m, and &s;uper&s;tition of rulers and people, afforded the mo&s;t commodious opportunity of putting their &s;chemes of aggrandizement into practice. Whoever looks into the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, will be apt to conclude that the prie&s;ts had imagined all mankind were made for their advantage, and that the Chri&s;tian revelation was con&s;idered by them as a cunning fable, invented for the benefit of the clergy.</P>
<P>Although popery has been aboli&s;hed, &s;till the clergy "are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with others"<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts.</HI> xiv. 15.</NOTE>. It does not yet appear, they have got above the temptations to pride and arrogance, which are apt to be excited, and gratified by dictating the religious faith and principles of the people. Ambition, and a lu&s;t of unbound|ed rule, with the other pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;orders of the human brea&s;t, are by no means, in our days, confined to the laity: and therefore, the pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ni&s;ters of religion have no better claim to exten&s;ive autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;cheme that has been pur&s;uing, as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olonies, is this; the leading clergy in England de&s;irous of in|crea&s;ing their power, and of building up a mighty Hierarchy in the Briti&s;h empire, are labouring to bring the colonies under their dominion, by every device they can think of. Many circum+&s;tances &s;eem favourable to this &s;cheme; mo&s;t of the provinces &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania, and the W. India I&s;lands, have by their own acts of a&s;&s;embly, provided a regular parochial maintenance for the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters. The like has been obtained by arti|fice in &s;ome few de&s;tricts of New-York, and an attempt has lately been made to extend it. In Nova-Scotia, epi&s;copacy according to the church of England, is declared to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; but as it might put a total &s;top to the &s;ettling of that new province, no tax for &s;upporting the clergy, is yet levied on di&s;&s;enters. At|tempts have been made, more than once, to get a legal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in the lower government of Penn&s;ylvania, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.
<PB N="168" REF="010857_0085_0F851F96A88185A8">And as e&s;tabli&s;hing lands for pious u&s;es, is not re&s;trained by the laws of the colonies, as in England, and mo&s;t other countries in Europe; and as the old &s;tatute made again&s;t granting lands to the church, are not &s;uppo&s;ed to extend here, mea&s;ures are taken to advance the intere&s;ts of the de&s;igned heirarchy, by making ac|qui&s;itions of this &s;ort. Accordingly in&s;tructions have been pro|cured from the crown, to the governors of New-Hamp&s;hire to grant a proportion of every new town&s;hip to the &s;ociety for propa|gating the go&s;pel; and a like practice has been begun at New-York. In that city and its Suburbs the lands of the epi&s;copal church are exten&s;ive and valuable; and if the place continues to increa&s;e, they mu&s;t in time become an immen&s;e e&s;tate. The Cod|rington plantation in Barbados, which is ve&s;ted in the &s;aid &s;ociety, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting a college, is &s;uffered to extend and accumulate in a mo&s;t rapid manner. To the&s;e might be added the funds of the colleges of New-York and William&s;burgh, the numerous glebes and man&s;es of the clergy in America, and the de&s;igned tracks of land for the future benefit of the Bi&s;hops, and for perfecting the &s;cheme; which hereafter may become of enor|mous value, when taken, with the above particulars, into one computation.</P>
<P>That nothing may be wanting to perfect the &s;piritual kingdom, the mo&s;t vigorous attempts have been making for above half a century to epi&s;copize the middle and northern colonies, which were &s;ettled by non-conformi&s;ts, and for this purpo&s;e a large fund has been employed in &s;ending out mi&s;&s;ionaries to the&s;e people, as if they were heathen, and utterly void of all go&s;pel knowledge. But as it has ever proved a difficult matter to change an ance&s;torial religion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been very much the ca&s;e of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where, &s;etting a&s;ide the Scots and Engli&s;h &s;ettlers, the alteration among the na|tives has been very incon&s;iderable, notwith&s;tanding the prote&s;tant e&s;tabli&s;hment has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted above <HI>200</HI> years. Perhaps le&s;s precipi|tations and &s;everity in this bu&s;ine&s;s, had been better. Any nation, e&s;pecially one claiming to be free, would re&s;ent extremely an at|tempt to impo&s;e a new religion, to which there was no pre-di&s;po&s;ition in its people; but in that kingdom, on the contrary, the rude un|cultivated inhabitants, were to the la&s;t degree attached to a &s;uper|&s;tition, from which they &s;uffered the greate&s;t injuries.

At pre&s;ent, the epi&s;copal colonies find it difficult enough to oblige the&s;e people, (who intere&s;t the Bi&s;hops of England in their preten&s;ions on every occa&s;ion) to &s;ubmit to any Acts of A&s;&s;embly that may affect them:<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tances of this &s;ort, that I now recollect, happened in Virginia, &s;ome few years &s;ince, on Occa&s;ion of an Act of A&s;&s;embly commonly called the <HI>Two-penny</HI> act. It affected all Salary men civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical: the civil Officers &s;ubmitted to the Legi&s;lative Regulations; but the Clergy revolted; and applying to England, by means of their <HI>great</HI> Friends, the Bi&s;hops, got the Act Repealed, with expre&s;&s;ions of Royal Di&s;plea&s;ure to the Gover|nor for pa&s;&s;ing it.</NOTE> but combined by a regular plan of di&s;cipline authori&s;ed by parliament, they will no longer be &s;ubjects, but lords and ma&s;ters ever every juri&s;diction in America.</P>

But none who know the nature of man, or have con&s;idered the tran&s;actions of pa&s;t ages can pay the lea&s;t regard to &s;uch declarations. Can it be believed by any man in his &s;en&s;es, that the leaders of a body of men, who by their offices, endowments, polity, connection and alliances mu&s;t unavoidably have great weight in public affairs, will be &s;o mortified to worldly con&s;iderations, as to renounce the influence and power their high &s;tations mu&s;t give them? No &s;uch in&s;tance has ever happen'd in church or &s;tate, &s;ince the world began. Some rare in&s;tances in|deed may be quoted, of individuals, who being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of high and dangerous authority, have had the magnanimity to renounce it; but of bodies-politic, &s;enates, or other combinations of men, we meet with none: Large a&s;&s;emblies or orders of men, are not diffident of their capacity to exerci&s;e power, or if &s;ome among them &s;hould be &s;o, the more a&s;&s;ured majority over-rule the few &s;queami&s;h brethren; be&s;ides the odium of &s;evere mea&s;ures, being divided among &s;o many, it has le&s;s effect in re&s;training their proceedings.</P>
<P>The recapitulation of the temporal advantages, which the epi&s;|copal clergy have obtained in the provinces, is not made with an invidious de&s;ign; but merely to alarm all people again&s;t the grand &s;cheme of &s;piritual dominion, that &s;eems to be planned for this country. If Church di&s;cipline is to be regulated by the legi&s;latures here, I &s;hall be in no great pain for civil liberty on this account; tho' it might be prudent to put &s;ome limits to the Church-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of all denominations. They neither &s;erve any purpo&s;e to religion, nor government; but often prove mi&s;chie|vous to both: Without the&s;e, the Clergy could never be an ob|ject of much di&s;tru&s;t to the magi&s;trate;<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> ob&s;erves, that when the Abbey and Church lands, which had been &s;eized by Henry the <HI>VIII.</HI> and given to the nobility, were confirmed to them by act of parliament (1&s;t and 2d. of Philip and Mary) the power of the papacy was effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for tho' the juri&s;diction of the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks was re&s;tored, <HI>their property, on which their power depended</HI> was irretrievably lo&s;t, and no hopes remained of recovering it.

<P>And this appellant doth al&s;o aver and in&s;i&s;t, that the &s;aid Ap|peal was brought <HI>to be delivered again&s;t a real grievance and op|pre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and not for the cau&s;e afore&s;aid; which &s;aid <HI>grievance and oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> con&s;i&s;teth in, and is compounded of divers great perils, labours, troubles, di&s;appointments, expences, and other hard&s;hips, ob&s;tructions, difficulties and inconvenience which hitherto have

<P>And for a&s;much as every rea&s;onable man and catholic Chri&s;tian, whether churchman or di&s;&s;enter, cannot but think it very unrea|&s;onable, cruel, and oppre&s;&s;ive, and again&s;t equity and good con|&s;cience, to deny their Chri&s;tian brethren any of the rights and privileges which they conceive to be e&s;&s;ential to the good govern|ment and order of the church to which they belong, this repli|ant thinks he has good cau&s;e to complain of being treated with an <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> temper, in the <HI>manner</HI> of the oppo&s;ition made to the &s;aid appeal; it being manife&s;t that this repliant wants no o|ther bi&s;hop than &s;uch an one as can in no &s;ort endanger the civil or religious liberties of any denomination whatever, and only for the purpo&s;e of <HI>ordaining</HI> and <HI>governing</HI> in his own church, and <HI>confirming</HI> &s;uch of his members as choo&s;e to be conffirmed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> AMERICAN <HI>WHIG</HI> [No. XII.]</HEAD>
<P>THE contumacious and refractory &s;pirit of our high church clergy, in endeavouring to inflame the populace, by har|ranguing on their imaginary di&s;tre&s;s in being deprived of what they never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that is a mitred generali&s;&s;imo, to head their army in &s;tripping us of our religious liberties, has been ta|ken notice of in a former paper. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s and im|mode&s;ty of their claim, con&s;idering that the mother country has done for them a thou&s;and times more than they de&s;erve, &s;hall be the &s;ubject of &s;ome future &s;peculations. For this day's entertain|ment, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew how extremely impolitic it would be in his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, to encourage &s;o dangerous a project, con&s;idered as naturally tending to introduce a &s;tate of indepen|dence on Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It is not a bare addre&s;s in a pre&s;ent emergency of affairs, that con&s;titutes the wi&s;dom of a politician. To de&s;erve the character of a wi&s;e and able &s;tate&s;man, one ought to penetrate into futurity and from the contemplation of cau&s;es, to look into effects and fore&s;ee con&s;equences. The&s;e colonies have frequently been char|ged by their enemies at home, with aiming at a de&s;ign of throw|ing off their dependence. This a&s;per&s;ion is equally fal&s;e and malicious. The North-Americans of all denominations, ex|cept high churchmen, prefer the con&s;titution of their mother country, to any mode of government that was ever devi&s;ed by the art of man. They have always revered every one of their prin|ces of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover, not only as their lawful &s;overeigns, but as monarchs, from principle and affection attached to their con&s;titution; and aver&s;e to the infernal doctrine of the uncontroulable power of kings, the power of injuring and oppre&s;|&s;ing tho&s;e, of whom God and the laws have made them the guar|dians and protectors. Hence, without the mo&s;t glaring partiali|ty of a Briti&s;h parliament in favour of their brethren at home, they will always reject the thought of &s;haking off their &s;ubjection, with indignation and horror. As they bear Great-Britain the &s;ame affection, and can boa&s;t equal fidelity; they think them&s;elves
<PB N="177" REF="010857_0089_0F851F99AB36E590">entitled to equal good treatment. With the duration of &s;uch u&s;age their dependence will, without &s;ome unimaginable concurrence of of circum&s;tances, be unque&s;tionably commen&s;urate. But &s;hould a future mini&s;try be weak enough to be deluded by &s;uch a dolo|rous ditty, as the convention hath lately groaned out, with <HI>la|mentation loud;</HI> or be inveigled by clerical artifice, to gratify the ambition, the in&s;atiate ambition of &s;ome of our rampant high|church clergy; nothing is more probable than that the&s;e colo|nies will be debauched from their loyalty, as &s;oon as this &s;et of men &s;hall be &s;ufficiently powerful. The &s;pirit of high church|men is ab&s;olutely incompatible with that of our excellent con&s;ti|tution; and was their power equal to their wi&s;hes, they would neither eat nor &s;leep before they had turned a limited monarchy, into an ab&s;olute one. Whenever they boa&s;t of their attachment to monarchy, they mean an unlimited monarchy, which they love, becau&s;e it would a&s;&s;i&s;t them to render the church ab&s;olute: But to the government of Great-Britain, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay indeed be called a monarchy, becau&s;e it has a king at its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad; but at the &s;ame time e&s;&s;entially participates of the republican form, becau&s;e &s;uch king can make no law without the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent of the people, they never were nor ever will be friendly. Nor are they greater enemies to civil, than to religious liberty: and in what ho&s;tile manner they have appeared again&s;t the latter, may be read in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of England, in characters of blood. Their hearts are not at pre&s;ent meliorated becau&s;e their hands are tied. When they talk of moderation, we know they mean want of pow|er. What has of late years re&s;trained, and at pre&s;ent checks, their fury in England; is the moderation and humanity of our pre&s;ent &s;overeign, and his predece&s;&s;ors of the hou&s;e of Hanover. What re&s;trains them here, is their dependence on Great-Britain as a body eccle&s;ia&s;tic. Having no affection for a con&s;titution limited by law, as the coloni&s;ts of all other denominations have; nothing can &s;ecure their allegiance but their &s;ubjection to the church. As this has &s;ome place in their affections, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it flatters their pride and vanity, by its external grandeur; they will, while kept dependent for their religious emolu|ments, be tolerable good &s;ubjects. But give them bi&s;hops and an hierarchy of their own; and de&s;troy their pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary inter|cour&s;e with the mother country, which would be the con&s;e|quence of granting them an independent epi&s;copate, and you di&s;|&s;olve the principle band of union between them.</P>
<P>They are at pre&s;ent maintained by contributions and charities from England: This with men of their turn is one of the &s;trong|e&s;t ties in nature. But an American epi&s;copate cuts a&s;under this cord. Let them have funds of their own by the management
<PB N="178" REF="010857_0090_0F851F9A6A362ED0">of their <HI>&s;piritual father</HI> the bi&s;hop, and adieu forever to their <HI>political mother</HI> Old England.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t now, to obtain orders (a cargoe of manu&s;cript &s;er|mons they might procure without going in per&s;on) take a trip to London. There they are ravi&s;hed with the wealth and magni|ficence of the church. Tran&s;ported like the Queen of Sheba, they confe&s;s, that &s;he <HI>exceeds the &s;ame that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eard,</HI> and <HI>that the one half</HI> of her <HI>greatne&s;s was not told them.</HI> They are dazzled if not <HI>with the wi&s;dom</HI> of the Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, at lea&s;t <HI>with their apparel,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>with their a&s;cent by which they go up into the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> So dazzled that <HI>St. Paul's Church</HI> will be fre&s;h in their memories, twenty years after <HI>his doctrines</HI> are utterly obliterated. So dazzled, in a word, that were they to live in their native <HI>Canaan</HI> for a thou&s;and years after, they would never forget the onions of <HI>Egypt.</HI> But give them all this gran|deur, with all the <HI>Doctor's political appendages</HI> in America; and a fig for <HI>Egypt,</HI> and all her onions into the bargain.</P>
<P>The&s;e are thoughts, that in my opinion de&s;erve the &s;erious con|&s;ideration of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and was there no other rea&s;on (tho' I hope to produce at lea&s;t one hundred and fifty) again&s;t countenancing the pernicious claim of a few a&s;piring prie&s;ts, in an affair &s;o extremely unfriendly to the pre&s;ervation of their loy|alty and, dependence, and &s;o generally di&s;agreeable to the &s;erious and worthy part of their own communion; this were alone abun|dantly &s;ufficient to reject it with ignominy and contempt.</P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, May 26th <HI>The</HI> CENTINEL. No. XI.</HEAD>
<P>IT was remarked in a former paper, that if the juri&s;diction of parliament to interfere in the internal police of the colonies, was ever &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet it would be extremely dangerous for us to have &s;o very delicate a part of it as church-policy, re|gulated by that re&s;pectable body; e&s;pecially as the propo&s;al has come from the clergy, &s;peaking as they pretend, in behalf of a million of American Epi&s;copalians. The members might indeed afford it as much attention as they u&s;ually give to American bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Witne&s;s the &s;ucce&s;s of Captain Cole, in getting the free expor|tation of rice re&s;trained, for his own purpo&s;es; the blunders in the late regulating &s;tatutes, concerning the word <HI>Ireland;</HI> as mentioned in the patriot <HI>Farmer's</HI> Letters.</NOTE>; and whil&s;t they incautiou&s;ly adopt the financiers &s;chemes for taxing us, they might as readily receive from the clergy, a &s;y&s;tem of faith and di&s;cipline for the American church. If it had the outward appearance of the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of England, they would &s;carce examine further, but agree to it without a Vote; and however un&s;uitable and inconvenient to the circum&s;tances of this country, they would doubtle&s;s con&s;ider any complaints from America, as humour&s;ome, if not factious, and highly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reverence due to the &s;upreme legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>However highly we may think of the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of the Briti&s;h &s;enate, yet we cannot but &s;ee &s;trong marks of their &s;u&s;tain|ing a quite different character in con&s;idering home affairs, from what they do in providing for us. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that when the &s;ubjects within the realm, and con&s;equently the indi|viduals
<PB N="181" REF="010857_0091_0F851F9F87261FB8">of the legi&s;lature, are to be a&s;&s;ected by the parliamentary proceedings, the debates are &s;erious and lively; the &s;crutiny into the con&s;equences of the bu&s;ine&s;s propo&s;ed, &s;trict and curious; and the appearance of intere&s;t and feeling vi&s;ible to all. Hence their &s;tatutes in the&s;e ca&s;es being penned with care, and corrected with caution, u&s;ually become la&s;ting monuments of the prudence of the national councils<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">How different the late regulating and revenue laws for A|merica! hence the &s;everal repeals; the incon&s;i&s;tencies and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of preci&s;ion, ob&s;ervable in mo&s;t of them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But this is by no means the ca&s;e, when a bill is brought in to bind the &s;ubjects <HI>without</HI> the realm, for the benefit of tho&s;e <HI>within</HI> it. Here the character of the watchful Repre&s;entative no longer appears; the bu&s;ine&s;s if at all attended to, and not treated as a thing of cour&s;e, is only regarded as it affects the &s;uperior king|dom. Whil&s;t the people in the &s;ubordinate &s;tates and di&s;tricts of the empire, are left to learn their inferior &s;ituation from the crude and mi&s;taken provi&s;ions of the new &s;tatute; which without really &s;erving the real intere&s;ts of any part of the Briti&s;h dominions, tend to di&s;tre&s;s and en&s;lave the di&s;tant &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>There is a mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of this, in the very different conduct of the parliament towards the admiralty juri&s;diction in England, and in America. The proceedings in this court, being before a &s;ingle judge, <HI>according to the cour&s;e of the civil law,</HI> have ever been looked on, and treated as repugnant to the free con&s;titu|tion of England, which making the people judges of one another, has provided in the be&s;t manner for the liberty and &s;afety of the &s;ubject. Trial by jury, is indeed that happy mode of admini&s;|tring ju&s;tice, which having &s;urvived the various changes and con|vul&s;ions of the &s;tate, has been pre&s;erved and handed down to us; and God grant we may be able to tran&s;mit it to our children! To the admiralty law therefore, the temper and policy of our ance&s;tors have always &s;hown aver&s;ion and jealou&s;y.

<P>Not content with this, &s;undry acts of parliament have been pa&s;&s;ed to circum&s;cribe, and as it were to naturalize this juri&s;dic|tion.

However as trade began to extend, and trials for capital offences, before this uncon&s;titutional juri&s;diction, more frequently to occur, the nation would not endure it; and

<P>Thus have the legi&s;lature, and the judges of the land, wi&s;ely concurred, in curbing and qualifying this arbitrary mode of judg|ing, as far as it relates to the mother country.

<P>As to pirates, and other &s;ea-felons, they and their acce&s;&s;aries are to be tried in the colonies, before a bench of judges, appointed by commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal, or &s;eal of the admiralty,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stat:</HI> 11 &amp; 12 Will.

<P>This, it may be &s;aid, was only re&s;toring the proper juri&s;diction of the admiralty. But why &s;hould a juri&s;diction be revived in the colonies, which had been found intolerable in the mother-coun|try? The laws of trade have however introduced a new one;

<P>Yea, &s;uch a favourite is the American admiralty, that the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, on a&s;&s;uming a power to tax the colonies, has given much of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court of Exchequer, which is a court of common-law, to this arbitrary tribunal.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Stamp-act, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> And, not content with bringing it a &s;hore at our &s;ea-ports, and enabling it to &s;courge our merchants, they have &s;ent it up into our forre&s;ts, and directed that the penalties impo&s;ed on &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall de&s;troy his Maje&s;ty's pine-trees in New-England, New-York, and New-Jer&s;ey, &s;hall be recoverable in the admiralty.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stat.</HI> 8 <HI>Gen.</HI> I. <HI>Cap.</HI> 12&mdash;2 <HI>Geo</HI> II. <HI>Cap.</HI> 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>Can any thing more fully manife&s;t the difference between a <HI>virtual</HI> repre&s;entative, and a <HI>real</HI> one? does it not &s;adly expo&s;e the hard&s;hip, the authors of that <HI>ideal</HI> character, were reduced to, when they &s;eriou&s;ly advanced &s;uch a wretched argument for binding America by acts of parliament? Is there any &s;ympathetic affection in the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itious delegates, for the &s;ubjects without the realm? or the lea&s;t attention &s;hewn to their intere&s;ts! Or, is it any wonder, that mini&s;ters of &s;tate, are able to procure the parliamentary &s;anction, to whatever they draw up for the colonies, without enquiry or debate?</P>
<P>This may account for a mo&s;t extraordinary &s;tatute, that has been pa&s;&s;ed the very la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of parliament, which gives a new blow to our rights as Engli&s;hmen. By this, provi&s;ion is made for erecting three or four admiralty courts on this continent, each to have juri&s;diction over two or more provinces; by which the con|&s;titutional and whole&s;ome &s;uper-intendency of the common law over the civil, is wholly evaded, as there is no court of King's Bench in America, of equally extended Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The pretence for this new mea&s;ure might be, that the multi|tude of judges of admiralty and their officers, le&s;t without &s;alaries to &s;punge upon the colonies for a living, had been a long and ju&s;t &s;ubject of complaint, and could not be well remedied, except by le&s;&s;ening their number, and giving proper appointments to tho&s;e

<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary for me to remark on this indignant treat|ment of a loyal, a u&s;eful, and numerous body of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.

<HEAD><HI>Thomas Bradbury Chandler,</HI> APPELLANT. Ver&s;us, <HI>Some</HI> of the people of North America, called <HI>Pre&s;byte|rians,</HI> APPELLEES.</HEAD>
<P>The further Replication of <HI>Tho|mas Bradbury Chandler,</HI> Doc|tor of Divinity, Appellant, to to the Plea, Demurrer and An|&s;wer, of the People of <HI>North-America,</HI> Appellees.</P>
<P>AND this repliant further &s;aith, that as touching the &s;aid &s;e|veral cau&s;es of demurrer, alledged by the &s;aid appellees, the &s;ame are not &s;ufficient in the law to preclude this repliant from the relief &s;ought for by the Appeal; for that the pre&s;ent cau&s;e of demurrer a&s;&s;igned, is frivolous, equivocal, illu&s;ory, and eva|&s;ive, in that it denies all equity whereon the people can ground a decree, and referrs the &s;ame as being only cognizable by the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whereas this repliant avers, that there is great equity contained in the matter of the &s;aid Appeal, and that <HI>all people</HI> who are not of a <HI>gain-&s;aying, gain-writing, gain-rea&s;oning, oppugning</HI> and <HI>contravening</HI> &s;pirit, might and do ea&s;ily &s;ee the ju&s;tice upon which the &s;aid Appeal is grounded. That neverthele&s;s, this repliant is willing and ready to &s;ubmit the &s;ame to the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who he doubts not, in their great wi&s;dom, will provide a &s;ufficient remedy for him in this behalf.</P>
<P>And this repliant further &s;aith, That the &s;aid appellee's &s;econd cau&s;e of demurrer, is ill taken, for that it &s;uppo&s;es a claim to have been made by this repliant, in behalf of the bi&s;hops, of one tenth of the lands in <HI>America;</HI> when in fact, and truth, this re|pliant
<PB N="186" REF="010857_0094_0F851FA1E1B14650">never did make any &s;uch claim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but in and by the &s;aid Appeal, hath demon&s;trated to the court here, that a bi&s;hop can have no &s;uch right or claim, as nece&s;&s;arily incident and appertaining to his office in <HI>America,</HI> as by the &s;aid Appeal, reference being there|unto had, may more fully and at large appear, and to which this repliant, for greater certainty, doth refer.&mdash;And this repliant is advi&s;ed that the &s;aid &s;econd cau&s;e of demurrer ought to be over|ruled, for that if the &s;aid claim had been really made in behalf of the bi&s;hops, yet it being of &s;piritual cognizance, could only be tried in the &s;piritual court, and not by an ejectment at law, as the &s;aid appellees alledge.</P>
<P>And as touching the third cau&s;e of demurrer, this appellant &s;aith, that the &s;ame con&s;i&s;teth only of <HI>words</HI> without any <HI>mean|ing,</HI> and that it is al&s;o manife&s;tly defective in <HI>form:</HI> For that he is advi&s;ed by his council, that to talk of <HI>pro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt</HI> of witne&s;&s;es and <HI>oral</HI> te&s;timony, is not warranted by the books, it being a term not known in the law, &s;ave only as to matters of written e|vidence; neither o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n this repliant conceive any idea connected in the terms <HI>We&s;t-India Negroes, Infidelity,</HI> and <HI>virtual churchmen,</HI> which to this repliant appear in&s;en&s;ible, repugnant and contra|dictory.</P>
<P>And as to the fourth cau&s;e of demurrer, which a&s;&s;erts, That a <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> bi&s;hop is not known in the law, this repliant doth charge, that the &s;aid appellees do only thereby di&s;cover their <HI>a|ver&s;ion</HI> to bi&s;hops as they are connected with the &s;tate, and this repliant verily believes, that the &s;aid a&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e, &s;o far forth as it re&s;pects them. But for as much as this repliant and his a&s;|&s;ociates, want only a <HI>primitive</HI> bi&s;hop, he conceives it would be &s;ufficient for over-ruling the &s;aid demurrer, if it were found that a <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> bi&s;hop is known in the <HI>go&s;pel;</HI> and this repliant avers, that from the go&s;pel it doth appear that a bi&s;hop may be a <HI>harm|le&s;s, blamele&s;s, inoffen&s;ive creature.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fifth cau&s;e of demurrer, this repliant &s;aith, as he has already &s;aid in an&s;wer to the &s;econd; with this further. That the title claimed by the <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> was not to the one tenth of the premi&s;es, nor to any temporal powers, as an unali|enable appendage to the bi&s;hops office in <HI>America;</HI> and that the &s;aid appellees, who&s;e clergy &s;upport their right of ordination, in, by, and through the &s;ame <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> are deriding their own order, while they are laughing at that of the church, who only place the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> in &s;tead of <HI>pre&s;byters.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;ixth cau&s;e of demurrer, wherein it is &s;aid the ap|pellees are charged with <HI>blowing the trumpet of &s;edition,</HI> this re|pliant &s;aith, That he is conu&s;ant of no &s;uch imputation again&s;t them in the &s;aid Appeal: and that he cannot conceive by what &s;trange <HI>tergiver&s;ations, &s;ophi&s;tications,</HI> and <HI>twi&s;tifications,</HI> his
<PB N="187" REF="010857_0094_0F851FA1E1B14650">words have been &s;o tortured, perverted, and <HI>tran&s;mogrified,</HI> as to give colour thereto. And fora&s;much as the &s;aid Appeal &s;ought not a di&s;covery in any &s;uch matters that were <HI>criminal</HI> in their nature, or which would expo&s;e the appellees to <HI>corporal Puni&s;h|ment,</HI> or <HI>Fine,</HI> the &s;ame cannot by any pretence be made the ground of a demurrer to the &s;aid Appeal, which aimed at no more than <HI>di&s;covering</HI> the true principles upon which an Ameri|can epi&s;copate was de&s;ired, and the <HI>ends</HI> propo&s;ed for the church of <HI>England</HI> thereby.</P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s touching and concerning the appellees &s;eventh cau&s;e of demurrer, this repliant &s;aith, That it is not drawn <HI>&s;ecundum ar|tem,</HI> nor is the &s;ame con&s;onant to, but tends to confound the &s;e|veral parts of good pleading which is manife&s;t in that it doth per &s;altem, as it were, award the &s;entence and decree of the court; which &s;entence is premature, being pronounced before the i&s;&s;ue between the parties were duly joined: And this repliant &s;aith, that the &s;aid decree is <HI>partial, unju&s;t, illegal,</HI> and <HI>uncon&s;titution|al,</HI> and therefore it is of no force either of law or equity; and this repliant is ready to aver, maintain, and prove, that the &s;ame is, to all intents and purpo&s;es, null and void.</P>
<P>And for further replication to the &s;aid an&s;wer of the appellees, this repliant &s;aith, That from time, of which there is no memory of man to the contrary, it hath been plain and manife&s;t that <HI>&s;ome per&s;ons</HI> who do <HI>advi&s;e, council,</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> the &s;aid ap|pellees in all matters and things wherein the intere&s;t of the &s;aid church of England is concerned, ever have done, and ever will Di&s;approve of all and every propo&s;al made for the advancement of the &s;aid church, and would at all times endeavour to <HI>mole&s;t, di&s;turb, expo&s;e, de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, re&s;i&s;t,</HI> and <HI>repul&s;e</HI> all rea&s;onable device and devices made on the part of, and for the benefit of the &s;aid church: Wherefore this repliant as concerning the matters of <HI>di&s;covery</HI> &s;ought for by the &s;aid Appeal, did not aim to <HI>di&s;cover</HI> Matters and things &s;o luminous, apparent, and notorious to all the good people of this province: and therefore he doth, as to the DISAPPROBATION of the &s;aid appellees, &s;et forth in their &s;aid an&s;wer, charge that the &s;ame is impertinent, and not ma|terial in the premi&s;es; and prays his co&s;ts in this behalf, to be adjudged to him, for the unnece&s;&s;ary charge he hath been put to thereby.</P>
<P>And this repliant further &s;aith, That if the &s;aid appellees have &s;een or heard of any paper or papers, writing or writings, &s;aid to be copies of petitions &s;ent by the convention to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> wherein any <HI>defamations, a&s;per&s;ions.</HI> and <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entations,</HI> &amp;c. are contained, this appellant doth charge that the &s;aid pretended copies have been fraudulently, and deceitfully made, fabricated, and con&s;tructed by the &s;aid appellees them&s;elves, or &s;ome of them,
<PB N="188" REF="010857_0095_0F851FABC2611D98">or by and with their, or &s;ome or one of their privity, knowledge or con&s;ent, in order thereby to give colourable pretext to their oppo&s;ition again&s;t the &s;aid Appeal; which this appellant con|ceives to be very unfair, unju&s;t, unrighteous, and iniquitous, if the &s;ame be true. And as this repliant is very certain that no &s;uch <HI>defamations,</HI> &amp;c. are &s;pecified and contained in the &s;aid ori|ginal petitions, he is con&s;trained to believe, either that &s;uch &s;ur|reptitious copies have been made and given out as afore&s;aid, or that in default thereof the &s;aid appellees, or rather their coun|cil, have taken upon them&s;elves to <HI>&s;urmi&s;e,</HI> and publi&s;h what they had not the lea&s;t evidence of any kind to believe.</P>
<P>And as for and concerning the &s;aid appellees <HI>denial</HI> of ever having <HI>per&s;ecuted</HI> the church in <HI>America,</HI> or that &s;he ever was per&s;ecuted by any other per&s;on or per&s;ons, this repliant doth a|ver, and will maintain and prove, that in <HI>times pa&s;t,</HI> the appel|lees, or their ance&s;tors in <HI>America,</HI> or in &s;ome parts thereof, have been known to u&s;e and exerci&s;e <HI>cruelty</HI> and <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> towards the &s;aid church; and by all the ways and means in their power, to make and render her in very deed, a church <HI>militant;</HI> and true it is, that in <HI>the&s;e latter days,</HI> the &s;aid church hath in <HI>&s;uch &s;ort</HI> become <HI>triumphant,</HI> as to pre&s;erve her&s;elf free and clear, and freely and clearly indemnified, exonerated, and di&s;charged of and from all former <HI>judgments, Fines, Amerciaments, impo&s;itions, Troubles,</HI> and <HI>Incumbrances,</HI> made and executed by the ance&s;tors of the &s;aid Appellees, or any per&s;on or per&s;ons claiming the <HI>right of per&s;ecution,</HI> by, from, or under them, in <HI>America:</HI> But this repliant doth neverthele&s;s believe, that there are divers cau&s;es, grounds, and rea&s;ons, upon which the &s;aid <HI>exemption</HI> may be ac|counted for, other than that of a thorough change in the princi|ples of the &s;aid Appellees, which this repliant cannot admit to have been effectually wrought in them.</P>
<P>And this repliant further &s;aith, that he doth admit it may be true, that the &s;aid Appllees have not now in their cu&s;tody or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>charter of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> mentioned in the &s;aid appeal; for that he conceives there might be, and really were good rea&s;ons again&s;t entru&s;ting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof with them; it be|ing manife&s;t that the &s;aid Appellees have not, nor ever had that cordial love, affection, good will, or benevolence towards the &s;aid church of England, which would have rendered this fundamental right of her's &s;afe in their hands. And this repliant is rather in|elined to believe, that had the &s;aid charter ever been entru&s;ted with the &s;aid Appellees the &s;ame would have been kept <HI>&s;ocret, privy, spake, covert and occult,</HI> or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed, &s;o that this re|pliant and his a&s;&s;ociates, never could at any time or times hereafter, have had or gotten the &s;ame again; or if the &s;aid appellees ever had the &s;aid charter, and the &s;ame hath not been &s;o &s;ecreted or
<PB N="189" REF="010857_0095_0F851FABC2611D98">de&s;troyed, this repliant doubts not but that it hath been either &s;o ob&s;cured, altered rai&s;ed, obliterated, interlined and defaced, or &s;o changed by fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es, forced innuendos, perver&s;ions, eva&s;ions, prevarications, &s;ubtilties, and un&s;criptural interpretations, that it is now become not the <HI>&s;ame</HI> charter whereof mention is made in the &s;aid Appeal, but <HI>other</HI> and <HI>divers.</HI> Wherefore this repliant doth not deny but that the &s;aid Appellees may po&s;&s;ibly, from one or other of the cau&s;es before mentioned, be well &s;atisfied either that they have not, nor ever had the &s;aid original charter: or if they had, that the &s;ame is altogether become forfeited, vacated, and repealed by the means, devices, and artifices afore&s;aid.</P>

<P>Unacquainted! Why, can you be ignorant, that the &s;ame rea&s;ons which made us enemies to the church, engage us to be equally &s;o to bi&s;hops.

If the clergy de&s;ire &s;uch bi&s;hops as they de&s;ire, they &s;hall have them, "it would be unrea&s;onable to deny them what their &s;alva|tion depends on,"&mdash;but they do not de&s;ire what they de&s;ire, neither &s;hall they have any bi&s;hop at all, for a bi&s;hop will per&s;e|cute: If he touches a meeting-hou&s;e, it will turn to a cook's &s;hop,&mdash;He'll &s;wallow down for his breakfa&s;t lands, tenements, with all and &s;ingular the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of independants.&mdash;His breath will bla&s;t the fruits of the field.&mdash;His urine will occa|&s;ion inundations, and the wind from his po&s;teriors, blow away our &s;ynod-men like locu&s;ts to the Red-Sea.&mdash;He'll dig up the bones of our forefathers for his food, and drink the wine of for|nication out of their &s;cull bones.

They appeal for a bi&s;hop, that &s;hall have power only over his own clergy, but I &s;ay they don't a&s;k for &s;uch a bi&s;hop, and whoever doubts what I &s;ay, is a &s;uper&s;titious bigot; and if he is a clergyman, I'll tell him he lies, to his face.</P>

Here will be a &s;tate un|mole&s;ted by prie&s;ts, or public wor&s;hip; then will commence <HI>the foundation of a regular American con&s;titution;</HI> a phoenix govern|ment, ri&s;ing from the a&s;hes of <HI>Great-Britain; omnipotence contends for it!</HI> Who can retard its &s;tructure?</P>

<PB N="193" REF="010857_0097_0F851FAEECBCBA70">
<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Monday May 30th. To the Printer of the <HI>KICK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR Chandler informs us in his Appeal, p. 57. that <HI>there are about eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and blacks in our i&s;lands and colonies,</HI> who are <HI>known chiefly to belong to the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England;</HI> and who according to his repre&s;entation and rea&s;oning, mu&s;t be reputed to belong to that church, and that therefore there is great need of an American Epi&s;copate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now this part of his &s;cheme may be greatly improved, by &s;hewing the propriety, that the bi&s;hop, or bi&s;hops &s;o devoutly re|que&s;ted, &s;hould be of the &s;ame colour and nation. It is allowed by all parties, that bi&s;hops &s;hould be <HI>grave;</HI> and it is equally well known that by the con&s;ent of mankind in general, black is an emblem of gravity, Thus bi&s;hops, and even, clergymen of all denominations, commonly wear black cloth of one kind or other, Hence it is obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight, that a bi&s;hop who was really black would have a great privilege in re&s;pect of gravity, which is an e&s;&s;ential qualification of an Epi&s;copate. This would conduce much to his venerable appearance.</P>
<P>And &s;ince there are &s;o many blacks who are churchmen, there would be a great congruity in appointing over them bi&s;hops of their own colour and nation. For negroes have their national pride and prejudices, as well as other nations, and on many ac|counts have aver&s;ion to the whites. They would therefore be much more likely to receive the in&s;tructions of religion from one of them&s;elves, than from one of another nation. This is &s;o plain, that it would be to &s;uppo&s;e too much dulne&s;s in the reader not to perceive it. And thus the great and good ends propo&s;ed by Dr. Chandler, cannot be obtained, but by having a black bi&s;hop &s;ent to America. And in the next edition of the Doctor's Appeal, he will doubtle&s;s improve this important thought, and amplify it by his fruitful genius into a pathetic &s;ection; e&s;pecially &s;ince without it his &s;cheme is far from being uniform and complete.</P>
<P>There are many precedents of <HI>Africans</HI> being bi&s;hops; was not the famous St. Au&s;tin an African? And he informs us, that there were nine hundred bi&s;hops in Africa, in his time. <HI>Augu&s;t. Tom.</HI> VII. <HI>de ge&s;tis cumemerit.</HI> And &s;ince there are &s;o many hundred thou&s;ands of blacks who are churchmen, why &s;hould they be denied the great privilege of having a bi&s;hop of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It cannot be pretended, that it will put the nation to more expence to appoint negroes for bi&s;hops, than other men, or that it will give
<PB N="194" REF="010857_0098_0F851FAF61244890">more umbrage to other denominations; but it would be ea&s;y to &s;hew, that both the&s;e would be greatly removed by this mea&s;ure, as every one mu&s;t be convinced by his own candid examination of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho much has been &s;aid about the uninterrupted line of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, yet it has never been pretended that it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be confined to men of a certain hue or colour. It will be readily granted, that a negroe can take as fa&s;t hold of this rope, as any other man, and make as good u&s;e of it as others have done. &mdash;It is al&s;o certain, with regard to ordination by the impo&s;ition of hands and confirmation, that black hands will be as commu|nicative of divine mini&s;terial authority and holy impre&s;&s;ions, as white ones. If any deny this, let them &s;hew that the validity of divine in&s;titutions is limited to a certain particular colour; or that there is not as much weight in the hands of a black dioce&s;an, as of any other.</P>
<P>And thus there are many rea&s;ons for a negro epi&s;copate in the colonies, and no objections have as yet been offered again&s;t it, nor is it ea&s;ily conceived that there can be any of much weight: But if there &s;hould be any, let the objectors propo&s;e them with mode&s;ty and candour, and they &s;hall receive a due con&s;ideration from the public's mo&s;t humble &s;ervant</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for the publication of my former letter, &s;igned an American Churchman, and as I now renew the corre&s;pond|ence with the &s;ame de&s;ign of vindicating our church from the odious imputation of a de&s;ign to introduce bi&s;hops into America, you have leave to make the &s;ame u&s;e of it. I call the imputation odious, becau&s;e as the law now &s;tands, we cannot have an Epi&s;co|pate in this country, but upon terms more mi&s;chievous than be|neficial. I have already &s;hewn, that bi&s;hops will nece&s;&s;arily bring with them the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and &s;ubjugate the colonies to the pride and tyranny of the clergy; evils of all others to be mo&s;t dreaded; and which to prevent and abhor, I hope, is as con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a churchman, as of any other denomination. All who expect to better their circum&s;tances by his lord&s;hip's favour, will fret at the oppo&s;ition, and be apt to deny the moderate epi&s;copalians, who di&s;approve their ambition and indi&s;cretion, to be true &s;ons of the church. This was a &s;tratagem of the papi&s;ts, and is now imitated by the tories, who to catch the vulgar, cover their real de&s;igns, under the cloak of zeal for the cau&s;e. But her glory never depended upon the fu|rious devotees who crowd into her bo&s;om: She acquired honour at the reformation, by the catholici&s;m of her chief leaders; and tho&s;e who have pre&s;erved it &s;ince, have always been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the holine&s;s of their lives, the charitablene&s;s of their tempers, their prudence, their love of liberty, and dete&s;tation of bondage. Our characters of renown, are &s;uch as <HI>Cranmer, Ridley, Burnet, Hoadly</HI> and <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who were as eminent for their meekne&s;s, as for their piety and erudition. <HI>Laud, Manwaring Sibthorp, At|terbury</HI> and <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> are their contra&s;ts; and with pride in their hearts, <HI>the church the church,</HI> on their tongues, and a fag|got in their hands; were ready for every project, which &s;avage intolerance, and the execrable principles of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, could dictate. All &s;ocieties are expo&s;ed to hot and de&s;igning &s;pirits, who would be willing to turn the world up-&s;ide down; and men of cool heads &s;ind often more difficulty
<PB N="197" REF="010857_0099_0F851FB0306B2FF8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n guarding the church again&s;t the ra&s;hne&s;s of her friends, than the open attacks of her enemies. It was the violence of a few bi|gots that obliged the government to &s;hut up the convocation, and deprive the church of England of the privilege of meeting in &s;y|nods and councils; a privilege infinitely more important to her, than the pre&s;ence of bi&s;hops in this country can be to us,&mdash;a privi|lege, or to &s;peak more properly, a right, perhaps e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of the church of Chri&s;t, and certainly agreeable to the u&s;age of every other Chri&s;tian church, in all countries, from the apo&s;tolic age, to the pre&s;ent day. Let tho&s;e who con&s;ider the di&s;tance of our bi&s;hops as an unparralleled hard&s;hip, reflect upon this lo&s;s, which the church of the mother-country has &s;u&s;tained, and by which &s;he is become di&s;agreeably di&s;tingui&s;hed from eve|ry Chri&s;tian church in the world. It teaches a good le&s;&s;on to us all; &s;he &s;ubmits to it, and her be&s;t friends &s;ubmit willingly, be|cau&s;e more evil than good, probably would continue to be the con&s;equence of the a&s;&s;embling of her clergy; and if &s;uch is like to be the ca&s;e, upon our e&s;tabli&s;hment of a hierarchy in America, we &s;hall approve our&s;elves good Chri&s;tians, good &s;ubjects, and good churchmen too, by a peaceable demeanor, under the trifling inconveniencies, comparatively &s;peaking, which we feel from the remotene&s;s of the bi&s;hop of London, to who&s;e care our churches are more particularly entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>But whether it was our duty to be content with our pre&s;ent &s;tate, or not; yet &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of bi&s;hopricks in America, will make a va&s;t change in our eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and naturally in|troduce a long train of alarming con&s;equences; I cannot help thinking, the very manner in which relief has been &s;ought for, &s;ubject to &s;evere cen&s;ure; and, that the people of our denomina|tion ought to be the fir&s;t to complain.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, the cler|gy of <HI>Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, Geor|gia,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands, had no concern in the late peti|tions tran&s;mitted on this &s;ubject; they &s;eem to have been hatched by a few warm mi&s;&s;ionaries in the provinces of <HI>New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ylvania;</HI> and propagated to the Ea&s;tern colonies by the help of the frequent uncon&s;titutional a&s;&s;emblies, latterly convoked under the name of the convention. It is a ra&s;h enter|pri&s;e of the clergy, without the intervention of the laity; and therefore ought not to be charged upon the church in general. I venture to affirm, that the majority of their hearers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable members of the churches, uncer the care of the&s;e very mi&s;&s;ionaries, knew nothing of the de&s;ign, till the petitions were actually tran&s;initted. In &s;o important a tran&s;|action, affecting every epi&s;copal church in America, all the cler|gy, and &s;uch of the laity, as were mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their
<PB N="198" REF="010857_0100_0F851FB0DFA2B970">rank and abilities, ought, doubtle&s;s, to have been con&s;ulted: And had the projectors been as eminent for their prudence, as they have &s;ignalized them&s;elves for their heat and precipitation; the public would not have been expo&s;ed to the anxieties, jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities, with which the whole continent is now di&s;quiet|ed and alarmed.</P>
<P>Admitting all that Doctor <HI>Chandler</HI> has alledged, to be true, yet <HI>a novelty</HI> was to be introduced; and though the whole con|vention a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;till the &s;tate of this country, as oppo&s;ed to a hie|rarchy, the dignities and privileges annexed to the order of bi&s;h|ops, in that from whence they are expected; the effect the law might have upon the claims of the new bi&s;hops, and the manner of guarding again&s;t powers, of which we our&s;elves are fearful, and which the Doctor him&s;elf will not permit them to enjoy; all con&s;pired to dictate a proceeding in a matter of this weight, with the utmo&s;t deliberation. It is in vain to attempt a vindication, by alledging, that all men were con&s;ulted by the Appeal; becau&s;e the machination was already begun to be carried into execution; the petitions being actually preferred: The Appeal was a &s;econd &s;tep towards it&mdash;and the very que&s;tion whether an alarm of the colonies at this juncture, was proper or not, de&s;erved the previous con&s;ideration of all the friends of the church. The publication of the Appeal, was it&s;elf therefore a great error, and cannot ju&s;tify the fir&s;t; &s;o that there has been a contempt in this proce&s;s of the greater part of our clergy, and of the whole laity, except a few, from who&s;e in&s;ignificancy, the projectors perhaps, expected nei|ther aid nor oppo&s;ition. But this not all, their conduct is as ex|ceptionable for their &s;hameful neglect, both of the government and the bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>Seven addre&s;&s;es intimately a&s;&s;ecting all the epi&s;copal churches up|on the continent, and to per&s;onages, and bodies of &s;uch rank as the &s;overeign him&s;elf, the two arch-bi&s;hops, the &s;ociety for propa|gating the go&s;pel, the bi&s;hop of London, and the two univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge, and upon a &s;ubject of the mo&s;t delicate nature; ought to have been laid before the governors of tho&s;e provinces, at lea&s;t, where the petitioners re&s;ided. If the de&s;ign was good, their aid was expedient; and it might be expected from them, as repre&s;entatives of his Maje&s;ty, who is by law the &s;upreme head of the church&mdash;Add to this, that being intere&s;ted as ordi|naries in their provinces, there could be neither decency nor ju&s;tice, in &s;oliciting an enterpri&s;e, in which they were, or might be deeply concerned, by a diminution of their perqui&s;ites without their privity and concurrence.</P>
<P>And as to his lord&s;hip the bi&s;hop of London, their <HI>&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s pus</HI> is e|qually a&s;toni&s;hing and repuchen&s;ible. Surely they could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be ignorant of the King's in&s;tructions to our governors, relative to
<PB N="199" REF="010857_0100_0F851FB0DFA2B970">the churches in this country. In the&s;e, while the rights of con&s;cience are &s;ecured to all prote&s;tants, due care is taken for the better government of our churches, by an order to the governors, to give countenance and encouragement to the exerci&s;e of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of London.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;tanding in&s;tructions to the governors, are nearly &s;imi|lar in all the provinces, not chartered, nor granted to proprietors. The&s;e following were given to Col.</HI> Montgomerie, <HI>the governor of</HI> New-York, <HI>with his commi&s;&s;ion, and are dated the 20th of Octo|ber, 1727.</HI>
<P N="57">57. You are to permit a liberty of con&s;cience to all per&s;ons, ex|cept pupi&s;ts, &s;o they be contented with a quiet and peaceable enjoy|ment of the &s;ame, not giving offence or &s;candal to the government.</P>
<P N="64">64. And to the end the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction of the &s;aid lord bi&s;hop of London, may take place in this province, &s;o far as conve|niently may be; we do think fit that you do give all countenance and encouragement to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame, excepting only the collating to benefices, granting licences for marriages, and probate of wills, which we have re&s;erved to you our governor, and to the commander in chief of our &s;aid province for the time being.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The epi&s;copal church in the city of <HI>New-York,</HI> was incorpo|rated by a law of the colony, in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s reign on the 27th of <HI>June,</HI> 1704; and the in&s;titution and induction of the rectors is enacted, to be "in &s;uch manner, and always, as &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;uitable to her Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions to his Excellency the gover|nor of this colony, for the time being, and that canonical right and authority which the Right Rev. Father in God, <HI>Henry</HI> lord bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors hath, and &s;hall have, over the &s;aid church." With whatever contempt therefore, &s;ome may think and &s;peak of the authority of this prelate in America; the mi&s;&s;ionaries ordained by him, ought above all others to have treated his claims, &s;o honourably guarded, with peculiar re&s;pect. I &s;peak as a churchman; our clergy, in my humble opinion, ought, not only to have acquainted his lord&s;hip of the de&s;ign of erecting one or more dioce&s;es, within that which he claims for the See of <HI>London.</HI> before any petitions were pre&s;ented to others; but to have had his expre&s;s approbation for holding the conventions in which they were contrived. That any applications to this end, were ever made to him before the commencement of the execution of this plain, I have never heard; nor without good proof will be induced to believe. Had &s;uch been the ca&s;e, their &s;ucce&s;s could not well have remained a &s;ecret to this day; nor is it conceivable, that his lord&s;hip would have countenanced conventions or a&s;&s;em|blies
<PB N="200" REF="010857_0101_0F851ED558581228">of the clergy in America, not allowed of in England; or for|mal addre&s;&s;es to the throne, upon a &s;ubject &s;o new and important, without bringing his maje&s;ty acquainted with the de&s;ign; who, would doubtle&s;s have &s;u&s;pended his royal concurrence, till the governors of the provinces had been ordered to report upon the expediency, both of the aim of the petitioners, and the manner propo&s;ed for carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>But this cen&s;ure upon the mode, will fall with &s;o much the greater weight, as the project it&s;elf is to the la&s;t degree danger|ous.&mdash;'Tis granted, that the introduction of bi&s;hops will give us &s;ome advantage of which we are now deprived; but the que&s;|tion is, whether greater evils will not en&s;ue, than tho&s;e we now complain of. Becau&s;e the church in America is not &s;o complete|ly organized as we could wi&s;h, are we to be regardle&s;s of con&s;e|quences injurious to our country, and perhaps to the laws of reli|gion it&s;elf? Gold, as the old &s;aying is, may be purcha&s;ed too dear. I acknowledge that more di&s;cipline is wanting; but to the honour of our mi&s;&s;ionaries, the nece&s;&s;ity in this re&s;pect is very far from being urgent, except in <HI>Maryland,</HI> and the i&s;lands. The expence of a voyage to <HI>London,</HI> for ordination, has its advantages and di&s;advantages; and confirmation is a rite which is undoubt|edly rational, and has its u&s;es; but I can tru&s;t the mercy of God without it; and after all, who will dare &s;ay we are a church without a bi&s;hop. We are under the pa&s;toral care of the bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> and if his lord&s;hip's di&s;tance is in &s;ome re&s;pects to be lamented, yet, to be hone&s;t, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that he has the whole &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; an advan|tage this to him, and to us, never to be concealed, but freely mentioned, and with the utmo&s;t gratitude. As our mi&s;&s;ionaries are dependent upon their genero&s;ity, they hold the power to go|vern them with ea&s;e; nor can we reproach the &s;ociety with any in&s;tance of their neglecting to withhold their allowance from a &s;ingle clergyman, duly convicted of immoral behaviour: So that in point of di&s;cipline, in&s;tead of magnifying our di&s;tre&s;s, we can bea&s;t a &s;uperiority to any part of England; for there, a wicked prie&s;t, by a le&s;s precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the intere&s;t of power|ful patrons, often out-braves the pa&s;toral authority of his &s;piritu|al father. This is a grievance the bi&s;hops greatly lament, and from which the church cannot be relieved, till the parochial in|cumbents, by a change of the law, are become more dependent upon the people, or their eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Happy, therefore, as the circum&s;tances of the churches are in America, there is really no foundation for adventuring upon the innovation, for which &s;ome men affect to be &s;o vehemently con|cerned. The benefit &s;ought for, is not worth the expence of the trouble and di&s;grace already brought upon us, by the jealou&s;y of the
<PB N="201" REF="010857_0101_0F851ED558581228">re&s;t of our countrymen. I &s;peak for my&s;elf, (and anxious for the honour of our church, I am happy in being able to &s;ay, that I know it to be agreeable to the general voice of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed and reputable per&s;ons of our per&s;ua&s;ion,) that I had ra|ther ther we &s;hould be under the See of <HI>London,</HI> di&s;tant as his lord|&s;hip is, with the aid of the &s;ociety to &s;upport him, while the world la&s;ts; than run the mo&s;t di&s;tant ri&s;k of expo&s;ing this coun|try to the unchri&s;tian cha&s;ti&s;ement of the &s;piritual courts, for the &s;pace of a &s;ingle year. And yet, that is not the only evil which will follow from the erection of epi&s;copates in America.&mdash;An in|crea&s;e of the power of the clergy of any denomination, where we are &s;plit into &s;o many, will di&s;turb and depopulate the continent, and &s;poil the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of e&s;tabli&s;hing a glorious, rich, and happy empire, which the world ever &s;aw. I love Chri&s;tianity for its philanthropy; and its friendline&s;s to mankind, I e&s;teem as one of the be&s;t proofs that it came down from our benevolent father, who is in heaven.&mdash;It was &s;aid by a great per&s;onage in the la&s;t reign, that it was the peculiar felicity of the plantations, that all prote&s;tant &s;ects were upon a par; and that the crown unem|barra&s;&s;ed by any per&s;ecuting laws, was at liberty to reward every man according to his merit. A &s;peech this, that would have be|come a philo&s;opher, and which, di&s;gu&s;tful as it may be to the &s;our &s;oul of a bigot, would have been approved by LOCKE, that prince of philo&s;ophers; and who was at the &s;ame time, one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of our church and nation. The principle is be&s;ides as politic, as it is Chri&s;tian. Con&s;i&s;ting of but a handful, what could England have done towards the &s;ettlement of this continent, which is now become &s;o great a magazine of her wealth, had &s;he not given into the mo&s;t liberal toleration. What matters it to the nation by what blood, or by what per&s;ua&s;ion &s;he is &s;erved, if &s;he is but well &s;erved: And has not the experience of more than a century evinced, that the Americans, who con|&s;i&s;t chiefly of foreign prote&s;tants, Scotch and Iri&s;h pre&s;byterians, and Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, breathe a &s;pirit of loyalty, perfectly free from the Jacobiti&s;m and Toryi&s;m of tho&s;e Sacheverelian bellow|ers, for <HI>the church, the church;</HI> who are &s;o &s;candalous to her, &s;o dangerous to the government, and &s;o rampant in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and numerous in other parts of the mother country.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is not only agreeable to the principles of &s;ound po|licy, to give no &s;ect an offen&s;ive preheminence in the colonies, (which an epi&s;copate tends to promote,) but it is really what the nation with which England has connected her&s;elf, &s;ince America was explored, may with ju&s;tice expect; and to prevent which, the Americans them&s;elves will proceed to the greate&s;t extremities. For as to Scotland, &s;ince pre&s;byteriani&s;m has as lawful, and national, and reputable an e&s;tabli&s;hment there, as epi&s;copacy has
<PB N="202" REF="010857_0102_0F851ED5E2C123F8">in the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land; and this continent is peopled by emigrations from both, no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for any odious di&s;tinctions to the prejudice of the &s;ons of either of tho&s;e churches. As to the Americans, what is the language of their charters, the commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions to their governors, the &s;tatute of na|turalization, and the colony laws unrepealed, with the con&s;tant u&s;age of government, in appointing per&s;ons to places both of tru&s;t and profit, without any religious di&s;crimination; but that if they are prote&s;tants and good &s;ubjects, nothing more will be expected? Depending upon this, people of different nations came out, and &s;ettled this wilderne&s;s; and thereby acquired a domi|nion for Great-Britain, which, if &s;he had been left to her&s;elf, &s;he never could have people. The Americans have therefore a compact to plead for their immunities: And all the benefits which flow from this country, whether they re&s;pect extent of commerce, wealth, or the augmentation of the number of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, even in Europe; to which la&s;t, the growth of the colonies has greatly conduced; are what we bring in our hands in return for the privileges we enjoy. Away then with every ill-policied into|lerant, contemptible, prie&s;tly project, contrived in a conclave, convocation, convention, or any other ne&s;t of narrow minded, proud, ignorant, inflammatory par&s;ons. No bi&s;hop without a &s;pi|ritual court. 'Tis by this rod, the church of England, accord|ing to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the law, corrects her di&s;orderly profe&s;|&s;ors. And if a number of the&s;e judicatories are once &s;et up in A|merica, farewell to tho&s;e emigrations from Europe, which have proved &s;uch fruitful nur&s;eries to this country. The bare apprehen|&s;ion if it &s;preads acro&s;s the Atlantic, will do us more harm than many are aware of. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, Sir, that it is not the church, nor even the majority of our clergy, that wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to this &s;illy &s;cheme; to tho&s;e only who are in the pay of the &s;ociety, and of the&s;e, to &s;uch as are di&s;contented with their allowance, it is to be imputed. All the re&s;t of the epi&s;copal clergy are quiet, and the body of the laity wi&s;h the mi&s;&s;ionaries had been &s;o too. For the &s;atisfaction of the weaker &s;ort, who think otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall in &s;ome future letters abundantly &s;hew, that, whether the non-epi&s;copalians are right or wrong, in this controver&s;y; we &s;hall be wrong, if we per&s;i&s;t in teazing the government to patro|nize a &s;cheme, that may, if it proceeds, involve us either in the calamities of a civil war; or by driving the pre&s;ent inhabitants out, or &s;topping further importations into the country, prevent the &s;ettlement of our lands, and by &s;inking their value, plunge us into ruin, and perhaps drag the nation after us into the &s;ame pit of de&s;truction.</P>

<P>THE Author acknowledges the receipt of an anonymous letter, on uncon&s;titutional, and unchri&s;tian proceedings of the Con|vention, in embarking in a late hazardous, and mo&s;t important enterpri&s;e, without con&s;ulting the members of their re&s;pective churches; which &s;hall be publi&s;hed in due time.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o very greatly obliged to a very &s;en&s;ible member of the Dutch Church, for his excellent letter, di&s;proving in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner, the late &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ion of tho&s;e churches being in <HI>any &s;ort</HI> epi&s;copal; and ingeniou&s;ly expo&s;ing the low arts of tho&s;e, who propagate &s;uch notorious fal&s;ehoods; which &s;hall al&s;o be in&s;erted as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>SQUIRE T. <HI>hates controver&s;y&mdash;e&s;pecially with an unfair, abu&s;ive adver&s;ary;</HI> N^o II. par. I.) 'tis natural; even a man, who <HI>loves dearly</HI> to play tricks and &s;eold, hates <HI>abominably</HI> to be tricked and &s;colded at him&s;elf. But who is this <HI>unfair and abu&s;ive adver&s;ary</HI> of <HI>Squire Tickle</HI>'s? The WHIG. Why, <HI>Jack Catch</HI> never dignifies the malefactor with this appellation. Alas! <HI>Squire T.</HI> (the <HI>Whig's</HI> Whipper) certainly does not con&s;ider, that he does too much honour to a ra&s;cal (who, taking no notice of his blows, &s;ays not a word to him, and who&s;e back&s;ide only is to|wards him) in calling him his <HI>adver&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>general</HI> ob&s;ervations in par. 2d. and 4th, all the world mu&s;t allow to be ju&s;t; but their <HI>particular</HI> application mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the <HI>tribunal of the public.</HI> So that par. 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th, I &s;hall <HI>tru&s;s up</HI> like two <HI>brace of &s;nipes on one and the &s;ame &s;pit;</HI> only <HI>ba&s;ting</HI> them with this ob&s;ervation, that I've often heard of a <HI>calf</HI>'s, but never of a <HI>bull</HI>'s being begot; nor did I ever before dream, that <HI>one &s;ingle bull</HI> could be begot upon <HI>two dams,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;o different as a <HI>&s;heep</HI> and a <HI>wolf.</HI>&mdash;Squire Tickle's <HI>very good friend, &amp;c.</HI> JACR PUNLOVE, mu&s;t needs be a <HI>very cunning fellow!</HI></P>
<P>Par. 6th. <HI>Squire T.</HI> declares, that the <HI>Whig</HI> and his <HI>faction,</HI> have <HI>written, and done</HI> NOTHING AT ALL <HI>in behalf of their country,
<PB N="204" REF="010857_0103_0F851ED6B8A1C5B0">to avert impending mi&s;chiefs.</HI> How he knows this, I know not; but this one thing I know, that, if the late &s;cribbling about <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> has occa&s;ioned <HI>divi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>di&s;tractions,</HI> Squire <HI>T.</HI> acts very <HI>con&s;i&s;tently (with him&s;elf)</HI> in charging all to the <HI>Whig</HI>'s ac|count; for who does not know, that the <HI>Whig</HI> wrote <HI>again&s;t</HI> bi&s;hops, long before Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> wrote <HI>for</HI> them.</P>
<P>Par. 7th <HI>Squire T.</HI> commends &s;ome late patriotic writers, and that not without rea&s;on, any man readily commends another, who exerts him&s;elf to pre&s;erve that property, which he hopes one day will be his prey; and no <HI>Tory</HI> will in any ca&s;e quarrel with <HI>even a Whig,</HI> while his views are not incon&s;i&s;tent with his own. However, I fancy <HI>Squire T.</HI> little &s;u&s;pects, that even that <HI>Whig,</HI> that champion for liberty, the FARMER him&s;elf, is one of the be&s;t writers again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate; had he known this &s;ooner, his 7th might have been of the &s;ame complexion with his 8th paragraph.</P>
<P>That the reader may di&s;cover the merit of par. 9th I beg leave to refer him to Dr. <HI>Ram-chicken.</HI></P>
<P>Par. 10th. Squire <HI>T.</HI> points out the <HI>Whig's</HI> &s;elf contradictions, the gro&s;sne&s;s of which every one mu&s;t needs &s;ee, who con&s;iders, that <HI>in, by, and through the church, and &s;o far as &s;he is concerned in the premi&s;es, Dr.</HI> Chandler<HI>'s Appeal &s;eems to breathe a zeal for religion,</HI> &s;ignifies preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing as Dr. <HI>Chandler breathes a zeal for religion;</HI> and that ASKS, <HI>without</HI> a condition, expre&s;&s;es no more than SEEMS TO ASK, <HI>with</HI> one. If in the other in&s;tances the reader, on again examining the <HI>Whig,</HI> &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to find the incon&s;i&s;tency, he, will no doubt wonder at the acutene&s;s of Squire <HI>T</HI>'s. <HI>eye&s;ight,</HI> which enables him to di&s;cover what no body el&s;e can.</P>
<P>What a fool the <HI>Whig</HI> was to talk of <HI>Bellarmine! Bellarmine</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ch&mdash;r,</HI> however &s;imilar, were <HI>ab&s;olutely, utterly, and entirely</HI> different per&s;ons. (<HI>Compare</HI> WHIG, No. I. par. 2, and WHIP, No. II. par. 2.)</P>
<P>Par. 12th, is full of critici&s;m (which Squire <HI>T. loves dearly</HI>) and par. 13th &s;ugge&s;ts a reflection on the va&s;t force it has to knock down argument.</P>
<P>In par. 14th, Squire <HI>T.</HI> &s;colds at the poor <HI>Whig,</HI> and his party, mo&s;t vehemently, though he had done the &s;ame &s;everal times before. So have I heard an <HI>old woman</HI> &s;cold her&s;elf out of breath&mdash;then puff&mdash;and blow&mdash;and then &s;cold again. <HI>Squire T.</HI> charges the <HI>Whig</HI> with <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation,</HI> (what was it a late writer &s;aid about <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s wife?) and if any man dares &s;ay it is an unju&s;t charge, or that there is one &s;ingle <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> in par. 10th, N^o II of the <HI>Whip,</HI> he'll be &s;colded at as an enemy to the CHURCH, and an <HI>adver&s;ary,</HI>&mdash;an abu&s;ive adver&s;ary, (oh! dreadful!) to Squire <HI>Tickle.</HI></P>
<P>Par. 16th proves <HI>Squire T.</HI> a ma&s;ter indelicacy of compo&s;ition; I dare defy the whole world to produce his equal. Let <HI>&s;cribbled,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to find at la&s;t the appearance of one in your paper of the 23d of May, who &s;eems as if he was willing to come to the merits of the cau&s;e in his &s;hort way to end &s;trife: To whom I beg leave to an&s;wer in the order of his particulars, which, N. B. it may be well for the reader of this to have under his eye.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is indeed certain, that the convention do de&s;ire an American bi&s;hop, and that very earne&s;tly.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is no le&s;s certain, that they do want, and de&s;ire only a truly primative bi&s;hop, meaning &s;uch a one as Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> de|&s;cribes, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be, (be&s;ides what is common to the other orders) only to ordain and govern the clergy, and confirm the laity, which they are per&s;uaded the mo&s;t primitive bi&s;hops always did.</P>
<P N="3">3. However uncharitably incredulous Mr. <HI>Whig</HI> is, it is al&s;o mo&s;t certain, that they mean as they &s;ay, and that without the lea&s;t equivocation, or mental re&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is by no means certain, as the writer &s;ays, that a modern Engli&s;h bi&s;hop, would be at all dangerous to the religious rights and privileges of any non-epi&s;copalians here; nay, the contrary is at lea&s;t highly probable, becau&s;e they are not &s;o now in England, nor have been for almo&s;t a 100 years, nor I believe ever will again.&mdash;However, <HI>bona fide</HI> we de&s;ire no bi&s;hops that can ever, by the con&s;titution, have any concern with non-epi&s;co|palians, any other than Chri&s;tian good neighbourhood:&mdash;We would not by any means, have them have any concern with any temporal or civil matters, nor hold any &s;piritual courts, only &s;uch as relate to our own clergy; let therefore our non-epi&s;copal bre|thren, henceforth, for the future lay a&s;ide all terror about them.</P>
<P N="5">5. We do therefore aver, that neither Mr. <HI>Whig</HI> nor any one el&s;e, have any manner of occa&s;ion to be alarmed about their re|ligious liberty, of which we don't know how indeed, they can be more &s;ecure than they are.&mdash;We do not blame them for be|ing
<PB N="206" REF="010857_0104_0F851ED7678FB368">concerned for religious as well as civil liberty, in both which we agree with them; it is only the cau&s;e of liberty we plead, and whether they will believe it or not, we are as heartily de&s;irous of their liberty as our own.&mdash;We only want to be upon as good a foot as they are, i. e. to have ordaining and governing powers of our own within our&s;elves, as they have, in which we would by no means mole&s;t them,</P>
<P N="6">6. It is therefore plain, that the&s;e Tory &s;cribblers among the pre&s;byterians, (for the gentleman that calls him&s;elf a Whig, is really a mo&s;t violent Tory, for the true old Whigs were always rea&s;onable, moderate, and charitable men,) I &s;ay, the&s;e Tory &s;cribblers, for repre&s;enting us as a faction, again&s;t the liberties of the country, and a &s;et of de&s;igning men, that aim at introdu|cing eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny are, indeed extremely abu&s;ive to us of the church, not to &s;ay outragiou&s;ly &s;o.</P>
<P N="7">7. I know all the gentlemen of the convention very well, and have all the rea&s;on to believe (that men can give) that they are hone&s;t men, and mean no more than I have repre&s;ented; and that they are ready to give all the &s;ecurity in their power; that they de&s;ire no further. And</P>
<P N="8">8. I beg any rea&s;onable man, or body of men, would tell us in the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s, what further &s;ecurity they would de&s;ire, beyond our &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, that we may, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;atisfy them. And</P>
<P N="9">9. I beg in the name of all that is good, to know, why till this is done, the oppo&s;ition &s;hould not be, at lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pended, and opportunity be given to attend to this &s;ingle point. And</P>
<P N="10">10. When this is adju&s;ted, I hope all controver&s;y, and every unchri&s;tian temper will forever cea&s;e, and be no more.</P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, May 9th. <HI>The</HI> CENTINEL. No. XII.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t Publication, I &s;tated the Conduct of Parliament to|wards the Admiralty Court in England, and compared it with their very different Behaviour towards it in America. I think it a very remarkable and alarming In&s;tance of the mi&s;che|vous Effects, that mu&s;t follow from "our Superiors" in England undertaking to make internal Regulations for the Colonies. If they &s;hould li&s;ten to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and attempt to provide for
<PB N="207" REF="010857_0104_0F851ED7678FB368">us a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, they would probably do as much more Harm, as the Subject is of more Importance. Every Circum|&s;tance leads to this Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>No Body of Men is intere&s;ted in &s;upporting undue Stretches of Power, or Abu&s;es in the Admiral's Court, and it is not impro|bable, that on proper and reiterated Repre&s;entations, the Mi|ni&s;ters of State might do us Ju&s;tice, in Re&s;pect of that arbitrary Judicature, or other In&s;tances wherein our Rights have been violated; at lea&s;t it would be in their Power to do it. The Suc|ce&s;s of the People of Ireland, in procuring the Limitation of their Parliaments, and the Independency of their Judges after long Endeavours, ought to in&s;pirit our Attempts, and never &s;uffer us to de&s;pair of recovering our Rights.</P>
<P>But if the clergy once gain an advantage, let the inconveni|encies, or oppre&s;&s;ions it brings on the laity be what they will, there is no coming at redre&s;s. The&s;e people have the artifice of making a zeal for orthodoxy, and a regard for their own intere&s;ts go hand in hand. By a&s;&s;erting their claims and encroachments to be of divine right, under e&s;tabli&s;hments they tie up the hands of the magi&s;trate, and make it dangerous for him to reform the mo&s;t acknowledged and mo&s;t pernicious abu&s;es.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><Q>I do not recollect any In&s;tance in Hi&s;tory &s;ince the Days of the Apo&s;tles, where the Reformation of Religion, in any material Point, hath been brought about by the Clergy in general.</Q> <HI>E&s;|&s;ay on &s;pirit,</HI> pref.&mdash;&s;aid to be Dr. <HI>Clayton</HI>'s, late bi&s;hop of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> Thus, when other arguments have failed, forms of church government, par|ticularly dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Bancroft</HI> in 1588, fir&s;t preached up, in the church of <HI>England</HI> after the reformation, that bi&s;hops were of divine right, an or|der &s;uperior to pre&s;byters.

<P>Lord Littleton<HI>'s Hi&s;t. Hen.</HI> II.</P></NOTE> have, at one time or another, been &s;tiffly maintained to
<PB N="208" REF="010857_0105_0F851ED82546E478">be of divine right: and this, when once in&s;tilled, into the zeal|ous, but ignorant and more numerous part of their flocks, has generally enabled them to &s;upport the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable u&s;urpa|tions, and to baffle all attempts at reformation.</P>
<P>The ri&s;que we &s;hould run, would be heightened by another circum&s;tance: The <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles</HI> in England, who&s;e power over their inferior clergy, who&s;e revenues, dignities, and &s;eats in parliament, nece&s;&s;arily give them great weight, would find them&s;elves intere&s;ted to have every power, every privilege they enjoy as far as po&s;&s;ible, extended to their brethren, the American bi&s;hops. The example of a reduced epi&s;copate in the Briti&s;h dominions, they could not but e&s;teem dangerous to their own juri&s;diction, and they mu&s;t of cour&s;e be induced to exert all their endeavours, and to watch every opportunity, which a weak admini&s;tration, or other favourable conjuncture, might afford, to advance and aggrandize the American hierarchy: in which, from the experience we have had of the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome, and the inattention of mo&s;t of our <HI>virtual</HI> repre&s;entatives, there is too much rea&s;on to fear they would &s;ucceed to their wi&s;hes; at lea&s;t no argument can be drawn from the watchful|ne&s;s of the laity of England, over the cleargy there, that a like caution would &s;ub&s;i&s;t as to the clergy of the colonies: Witne&s;s the ca&s;e of admiralty juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e that Dr. Chandler's &s;cheme, as exhibited in Italicks, in the 79th page of his <HI>Appeal,</HI> is <Q>without <HI>re&s;ervation or equivocation,</HI> the exact plan of an American epi&s;copate, as it hath been &s;ettled at home.</Q> viz. <Q><HI>That the bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to the colonies &s;hall have no authority, but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the church and not from the State&mdash;That this authority &s;hall operate only on the clergy and not on the laity, nor di&s;&s;enters of any denomination&mdash;That the bi&s;hops &s;hall not inter|fere with the property or privileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or di&s;&s;enters&mdash;That in particular they &s;hall have no concern with the probate of wills, letters of guardian&s;hip, and ad|mini&s;tration or marriage licences, nor be judges of any ca&s;es relating thereto; but that they &s;hall only exerci&s;e the original powers of their office as before &s;tated,</HI> i. e. <HI>ordain and govern the clergy, and admi|ni&s;ter confirmation to &s;uch as de&s;ire it.</HI></Q> let us &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that the word of Dr. Chandler, a private mi&s;&s;ionary, is to be taken in this mo&s;t important affair; and that the bi&s;hops would, <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> be &s;ent over with &s;uch limited Powers, what Security have we, that they and their Succe&s;&s;ors, for any long Time, would remain contented with &s;uch Limitations: In a Word, that they would continue &s;uch harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive People, as the Doctor repre&s;ents them? Has this order of men been remarkable
<PB N="209" REF="010857_0105_0F851ED82546E478">for &s;uch quiet unambitious conduct? Or have they u&s;ually been free of a di&s;po&s;ition to intermeddle in worldly matters? Does not their apologi&s;t Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> intimate the very rever&s;e, when he &s;ays, Page 110, <Q><HI>Should the government &s;ee fit</HI> hereafter <HI>to inve&s;t them with &s;ome degree of civil power, worthy their acceptance, none would be thereby injured?</HI></Q> Is it rea&s;onable to think that the American prelates, would ever be ea&s;y whil&s;t in a Condition inferior to the &s;uperb, court-favoured, law-dignified bi&s;hops of England? e&s;pecially, as the connections between them, would always keep alive the hopes of the former, of arriving at the &s;ame authority and Importance.</P>
<P>A late writer (&s;aid to be of high &s;piritual dignity beyond the Alantic) a&s;&s;ures us, that as the bi&s;hops intended for America, are "to be appointed by the crown, the &s;malle&s;t attempt towards an oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of &s;piritual power would be immediately cru&s;hed with indignation by the legi&s;lature; and that the mode|ration of the clergy and the watchfulne&s;s of the laity over them, is much more likely to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Dr. Mayhew's ob&s;ervations on the charter and con|duct, &amp;c.</NOTE> This is plau&s;i|ble, but not &s;olid. However, at pre&s;ent we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that under &s;uch directors of the national councils as have of late pre|&s;ided, there has been a di&s;covery of &s;o much wi&s;dom and integri|ty; <HI>of &s;o tender a concern for the intere&s;ts of the colonies; of &s;o cautious, &s;o delicate an apprehen&s;ion of injuring their con&s;titution|al rights,</HI> as leaves no room to fear any oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of <HI>&s;piritual</HI> or <HI>any other power,</HI> during the continuance of &s;uch an <HI>happy</HI> guidance of public mea&s;ures: Yet times may change; men of a different &s;tamp may be employed; who knows what another reign may produce? Whatever may be promi&s;ed now, yet rea|&s;ons of &s;tate, (which Dr. Chandler already holds out to our &s;upe|riors) it may be &s;aid, require more to be done for this <HI>new-fang|led</HI> hierarchy; for a bi&s;hop without authority over the laity, is really a novelty, which no denomination of Chri&s;tians, that allowed of a regular Mini&s;try, ever before thought of. Either &s;ole or a&s;&s;i&s;ted, the bi&s;hops or pa&s;tors of all &s;ects have exerci&s;ed it as of &s;criptural and unalienable right; nor can there be any church of Chri&s;t on earth, without this, or &s;omewhat equivalent to it.</P>
<P>When the bi&s;hops (to carry on the &s;uppo&s;ition) &s;hall be once quietly &s;ettled among us, we &s;hall be told by Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> or &s;ome equal advocate for the order, "that the church in America is in a mo&s;t wretched and deplorable condition, peri&s;hing for want of common nece&s;&s;aries, and under &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, as mu&s;t prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected; that &s;he only re|que&s;ts, that proper remedies may be provided for her &s;ufferings,

"The people are &s;en&s;ible of the want of this power over them, and find them&s;elves free from all re&s;traints of eccle&s;ia&s;tical, autho|rity: And though the church, as far as it has relation to civil power, is in the nature of it a free &s;ociety, yet after men become members, the laws of the church are in force again&s;t them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appeal, <HI>P.</HI> 29.</NOTE> It is true, this was at fir&s;t given up, but we find, we "are a body without &s;trength, liable to be de&s;troyed by innumerable ac|cidents;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 30.</NOTE> in &s;hort, we are under an "unprecedented hard&s;hip"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid</HI> 77.&mdash;</NOTE> without it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT an in&s;idious faction has long endeavoured to cru&s;h the CHURCH of England in America, in order to erect a &s;piritual tyranny, when that great ob&s;tacle is removed, will, I believe, be ap|parent to every one who con&s;iders the &s;teps they have taken. Eve|ry engine that malice could invent has been &s;et at work. The characters and conduct of her clergy, however innocent or re&s;pect|able, have been traduced.&mdash;Her doctrines mi&s;repre&s;ented. Her decent ceremonies expo&s;ed to ridicule, and her &s;ons, be&s;ides other opprobrious Names, branded with the odious title of Per&s;ecutors; when, by all men of candour, it is acknowledged that the CHURCH of England is not only the bulwark of the reformation, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a truly Chri&s;tian &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and toleration.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ba&s;e arts might prejudice the weak and unwary, &s;till there was great danger, lea&s;t the rays of truth &s;hould di&s;pel the cloud of mi&s;repre&s;entation, and crafty politicians fail of their de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Under this apprehen&s;ion, it was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;uade all denominations of Chri&s;tians to unite again&s;t the CHURCH, as a common Enemy: And at the &s;ame time, le&s;t any &s;hould be hereafter competitors for dominion, it became ex|pedient to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion among them, that by their inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, they might become an ea&s;y prey to the&s;e de|&s;igning Incendiaries. For Pro&s;ecution of the latter part of &s;o notable a &s;cheme, they have already rent to pieces the Dutch church within this province, which next to the church of England, bade the faire&s;t to oppo&s;e them) and introduced &s;uch heart burnings and enmity among its members, as time can never remove.&mdash;The French church has al&s;o been practi&s;ed upon, and ruined by them. They have not been content 'till they in|troduced a creature of their own to preach there; one connected with them both by affinity and a &s;imilarity of intere&s;ts.&mdash;All this mi&s;chief has been done under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip; and &s;o great is the blindne&s;s of many well-meaning per&s;ons, that I make no doubt their eyes will not be thoroughly opened, 'till this &s;ubtil &s;ect, like Aaron's rod, &s;wallow them all up.</P>

<P>As to the former part of the &s;cheme it mu&s;t be obvious to every one, who has peru&s;ed the elegant performances compo&s;ed <Q>in the&s;e boa&s;ted times of moderation and candour.</Q> by the celebrated and incomparable triumvirs of this inoffen&s;ive party, under the glorious titles of the Independent Reflector, the Watch Tower, and the American Whig. Frequent u&s;e occurs therein of the term di&s;&s;enters, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to include all that differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances, however op|po&s;ite they may be to one another, both in principles and intere&s;t. They are called upon to defend tho&s;e liberties which are not at|tacked, and maintain tho&s;e rights which are not di&s;puted: And as fraud and falacy, are u&s;ually practi&s;ed in &s;uch ca&s;es, every me|thod, however di&s;hone&s;t, is taken to infu&s;e groundle&s;s fears, and and unrea&s;onable prejudices; particularly in No. IX. of the American Whig, a letter is &s;ub-join'd as from a Quaker, (for I &s;u&s;pect a Forgery) evidently to induce that re&s;pectable body of men, who are known to have a regard for the church, to join with its enemies, the in&s;idious faction, who arrogantly a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves the name of pre&s;byterians; with your permi&s;&s;ion, therefore, Sir, as a means of obviating the ill con&s;equences that may ari&s;e from that letter, and opening peoples eyes. I will briefly con&s;ider an a&s;&s;ertion it contains, &s;o notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, that I wonder it could drop even from the pen of the American Whig; who, as well as &s;ome others of his party, is known to a&s;&s;ert roundly.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age I mean, is couch'd, in the following terms, <Q>&s;ince our fathers came out from their Babyloni&s;h captivity, into this peaceable Zion, they, and we, have &s;et down under our own vines and our own fig trees, and have had none to make us afraid.</Q></P>
<P>The Whig would undoubted intimate by the words <Q>peaceable Zion,</Q> that the quakers have enjoyed full liberty of con&s;cience &s;ince they emigrated to the continent of America.&mdash;But ala&s;s! how far is this from being the ca&s;e? For no &s;ooner were the Inde|pendents (who would fain be called pre&s;byterians) fixed in the northern colonies, to which they fled, (&s;ome few perhaps, for con&s;cience &s;ake, others to avoid the puni&s;hment due for the murder of their king, and the overthrow of the con&s;titution) than they exerci&s;ed a mo&s;t illegal and de&s;potic authority in the matters of religion. But their rage was chiefly again&s;t the people, who (we are now told) &s;ince they came into this peaceable Zion, have &s;et down under their own vines and their own fig trees, and have had none to make them afraid. With re&s;pect to the Quakers therefore, this Zion has not been quite &s;o peaceable as the Whig would per&s;uade us. The fires of per&s;ecution, were lighted in it by the &s;ame per&s;ons, who, if we may believe Mr. Living&s;ton, in his mode&s;t letter to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, "had for&s;aken hou&s;es
<PB N="214" REF="010857_0108_0F851EDA64E1AA68">and lands, and the mo&s;t tender connections with every thing dear and e&s;timable among&s;t human kind, for the undi&s;turbed fruition of the rights of private judgment, &s;acred by the laws of God and of nature." Influenced by this motive as that gentleman &s;up|po&s;es, and &s;en&s;ible that the rights of private judgment were &s;a|cred, they neverthele&s;s became more &s;anguinary than the &s;angui|nary &s;avages of the de&s;ert with whom they had to encounter. The Quakers, contrary to the principles of ju&s;tice and equity, were &s;everely fined and impri&s;oned, and their per&s;ons treated with the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarity. They were bani&s;hed by a law, &s;o called, under pretence that they withdrew from orderly church fellow&s;hip, allowed and approved by all orthodox profe&s;&s;ors of the truth, (a ready pretence for per&s;ecution at all times, and upon all occa&s;ions) and &s;ome of them were put to the mo&s;t ignominious death for con&s;cience &s;ake, contrary to the rights of private judg|ment, &s;acred by the laws of God and of nature. Nay, &s;o wantonly were the&s;e u&s;urpations over the con&s;ciences of men exerci&s;ed, that pri&s;oners were refu&s;ed a trial by jury, the undoubted right of every free born Briton and American; the dead bodies of tho&s;e who fell a &s;acrifice to the rage of bloody bigots, were &s;tripp'd, and depriv'd of a decent burial; and the exulting prie&s;t of &s;o virtuous a people, compo&s;ed a ludicrous ballad upon the occa&s;ion; for which his character, with that of his worthy compatriots, will, as Mr. Li|ving&s;ton judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, make a bright figure in hi&s;tory, and be handed down with honour to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Thus much may &s;erve to &s;hew that this peaceable Zion has, in reality, been to the Quakers, a vale of tears; and as to the vine and fig tree, (a &s;criptural metaphor intended to repre&s;ent the &s;ecurity that the Quakers enjoyed in the Whig's imagination, I &s;uppo&s;e, as to property and per&s;on) the above remarks will &s;uffice to &s;hew, that they al&s;o are inapplicable to &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ufferings and per|&s;ecution; for &s;urely a people bani&s;hed by law, under pain of death, who, like Noah's Dove, could find no re&s;t for the &s;oals of their feet, can hardly with any propriety, be &s;aid to have &s;et under their own vines, and their own fig trees, and have had none to make them afraid.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted that the ca&s;e was not &s;o within this province; I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that the&s;e fanatical independents never got firm enough footing here for that purpo&s;e: And &s;econdly, That though for the above rea&s;on, they did not per&s;ecute the Quakers them&s;elves, yet by their artful and fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, they prevailed upon the Dutch to do it; who, I believe, would have been aver&s;e from the mea&s;ure, had they been rightly inform|ed; and even prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd as they were, burnt not with that fiery real which enflamed their neighbour coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="010857_0108_0F851EDA64E1AA68">
I have thus, Sir, expo&s;ed the de&s;igns of the independents, and of their doughty champion the American Whig, and &s;hewn that that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ities are advanced by them to gain the mo&s;t dangerous ends. I &s;hall conclude with remarking, that if the church of England has ever entertained per&s;ecuting principles, &s;he has renounced them with dete&s;tation, in the heighth of her power; whereas the independents have never had the upper hand, but they have ruled with the iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, and openly practi&s;ed that per&s;ecution which they before affected to abhor; like Proteus, continually changing figure, and becoming, as occa&s;ion required, one while the gently murmuring &s;tream; and another, the ferocious Lion, or the bloody Bear.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THE following letter came to my hands as the genuine pro|duction of a member of the Dutch church, who hath had &s;ufficient provocation for the re&s;entment he di&s;covers again&s;t the &s;hamele&s;s &s;cribblers employed for the convention: Scribblers, who in open defiance of all mode&s;ty and decorum, are engaged in preverting truth, propagating fal&s;hood, out-raging common &s;en&s;e, and abu&s;ing without offence given the mo&s;t numerous denomi|nation of Chri&s;tians in this province.

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To the Author of the <HI>AMERICAN WHIG,</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND that the advocates for an American Epi&s;copate (how agreeable to truth I leave the world to judge) not being able to make the church of Holland epi&s;copal, endeavour to divide her as being neither epi&s;copal nor pre&s;byterian, but &s;omething between both; a conduct, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;imilar to that of the fal&s;e mother, who &s;aid, "let the child be neither thine
<PB N="216" REF="010857_0109_0F851EDD5E679D78">nor mine, but divide it." Agreeable to this ab&s;urd conceit, equally groundle&s;s and impudent, we have lately been told, <Q>That the church of Holland is not epi&s;copal exactly in the &s;ame manner that the church of England is epi&s;copal; neither is it pre&s;byterian in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters are pre&s;byterian, as is evident from the di&s;tinction made in their or|dination, of a member of the cla&s;&s;is, or an ordinary pa&s;tor or pre&s;byter. When a member of the cla&s;&s;is is ordained, the powers of ordination and government are committed to him; but when an ordinary pa&s;tor is ordained, no &s;uch powers are confer|red on him, but only the powers of preaching the word and ad|mini&s;tering the &s;acrament.</Q> [I &s;uppo&s;e they mean &s;acraments.]</P>
<P>From this, one would be apt to conclude, that we of the church of Holland in America (to u&s;e a parallel phra&s;e with Dr. Chand|ler) are a kind of mongrel, neither epi&s;copal nor pre&s;byterian, but &s;omething between both. But what kind of con&s;titution that &s;omething is, or ought to be called, is not &s;o much as hinted.&mdash;I therefore think it my duty to inform tho&s;e who want informa|tion, what the con&s;titution of the church of Holland is; and that not from what I have been told, but from what I know to be the ca&s;e, as an old member of that church, who have not lately, but many years &s;ince, made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to examine &s;e|veral church con&s;titutions, and e&s;pecially that, of which I profe&s;s my&s;elf a member.</P>
<P>I therefore affirm, and hope to prove beyond all que&s;tion, that the church of Holland is as little epi&s;copal as any pre&s;byterian church on earth. This appears from the 30th and 31&s;t articles of her confe&s;&s;ion of faith; an ab&s;tract of the 31&s;t is as follows. <Q>As for the mini&s;ters of God's word, they have equally the &s;ame power and authority where&s;oever they are, as they are all mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t, the only univer&s;al bi&s;hop, and only head of the church.</Q> Is it in the power of language more clearly to deny epi&s;copacy; or to a&s;&s;ert pre&s;byteriani&s;m? Pray what is properly pre&s;byteriani&s;m? I an&s;wer it is that form of church government, wherein no higher authority is allowed, than that of elders, or, which is the &s;ame thing, pre&s;byters. Therefore the word ren|dered in Engli&s;h <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> is in Dutch tran&s;lated by that of <HI>Elder&s;hip</HI>&mdash;1 Tim. iv <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4. Hence it appears, that not only the reformed churches of Holland, Scotland, Geneva, and many of the German churches are Pre&s;byterian, but that the congre|gationali&s;ts and Bapti&s;ts are al&s;o Pre&s;byterian.&mdash;The difference lies only in this, that the former extend their juri&s;diction further than the congregationali&s;ts and Bapti&s;ts, who re&s;pectively confine their juri&s;diction within the &s;ingle congregation, of which they have the pa&s;toral charge; whereas the other churches have their con&s;i&s;tories (or kirk &s;e&s;&s;ions) then their pre&s;byteries or cla&s;&s;is, next
<PB N="217" REF="010857_0109_0F851EDD5E679D78">provincial &s;ynods, and la&s;t of all a general a&s;&s;embly or national &s;ynod. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the mini&s;ter or mini&s;ters, elders and deacons of one congregation; the next of two or more of the mi|ni&s;ters a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ers of neighbouring congregations, or &s;uch a num|ber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deputed by tho&s;e congregations for that purpo&s;e; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;i&s;ts of the deputies of the &s;everal pre&s;byteries; and the la&s;t of the deputies of the provincial a&s;&s;emblies.&mdash;Per&s;ons aggrieved in any of the lower judicatories can appeal to the higher. So that there is the greate&s;t harmony and &s;imilarity in the pre&s;byte|rian church government of the church of Scotland, church of Holland, and the pre&s;byterians in North America, that could po&s;&s;ibly be expected, con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of two differ|ent national churches, and the great di&s;tance and non-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the la&s;t mentioned, in America; who, neverthele&s;s, have their regular church-&s;e&s;&s;ions, pre&s;byteries and &s;ynods.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome may object, that tho&s;e of the church of Hol|land are not called pre&s;byterians, neither have they pre&s;byteries.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it is true, that they are not u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by that appellation as a denomination; neither was there ever any occa&s;ion for it, they being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the reformation of their doctrines, in oppo&s;ition to the church of Rome, and other heritics, by the name of 'The reformed church of Netherland.'&mdash;But the church of Scotland, and tho&s;e of their per&s;ua&s;ion in England, having, from time to time, had many &s;truggles with epi&s;copacy, they being zealous for pre&s;byterian government, were, in contradi&s;tinction to epi&s;copalians, called pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P>The church of Scotland however (and tho&s;e who hold to the &s;ame con&s;titution in other parts of the world) from her doctrines contained in her Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith and We&s;tmin&s;ter Catechi&s;m, have as good a claim to the title of <HI>reformed church</HI> as the church Holland. On the other hand the church of Holland may as pro|perly be called the pre&s;byterian reformed church, as the church of Scotland. But &s;hould this not &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy &s;ome preju|diced per&s;on, I hope he will allow the te&s;timony of an epi&s;copali|an hi&s;torian; I mean Mr. Salmon, who in his hi&s;torical geogra|phical grammar, in his de&s;cription of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the united Netherlands, &s;ays, 'Their church government is pre&s;|byterian.'</P>
<P>The other objection (if any one is weak enough to make it) <HI>that the church of Holland hath no pre&s;byteries,</HI> is altogether groundle&s;s; a cla&s;&s;is and pre&s;bytery being &s;ynonymous terms, when applied to their &s;econd eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatory, which con&s;i&s;ts of a number of pre&s;byters convened to repre&s;ent &s;everal congregati|ons, they are a cla&s;&s;is of presbyters, and therefore in effect a pre&s;|bytery: Nay, it appears from the proceedings of the a&s;&s;embly of Divines, who met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, about 115 years ago; that the
<PB N="218" REF="010857_0110_0F851EDD77A9FC18">church judicatory, now called a presbytery, was then called a cla&s;&s;is. Words in them&s;elves are arbritrary; it is the ideas affixed to them that determine their &s;ignification. 'Tis well known, that the Dutch call their Kerken Raad, or Church Se&s;&s;ion, a con&s;i&s;|tory; yet it is obvious, that we do not by this mean a con&s;i&s;tory of cardinals, (as among the Papi&s;ts) So al&s;o the word a&s;&s;embly, when preceded by the words <HI>a wicked</HI> or <HI>a pious,</HI> convey very different ideas.</P>
<P>From all which it appears, that the church government of Holland, Scotland, and the Dutch and presbyterian churches here, are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame; and that the term Dutch and Engli&s;h presbyterians, may be u&s;ed among us with the greated propriety; though the term may at pre&s;ent &s;ound a little &s;trange for want of the &s;anction of cu&s;tom. But in order to render the matter if po&s;&s;ible &s;till plainer, I pre&s;ent the reader with the whole, in the following &s;hort view, viz.</P>
<P>The church of Holland call their fir&s;t, or lower church ju|dicatory, a Kerken Raad, or Con&s;i&s;tory, their 2d a cla&s;&s;is, their 3d, a Provincial Synod, their 4th or highe&s;t, a National Synod.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can. Synd. Dort Art. <HI>29.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The church of Scotland call their fir&s;t or lowe&s;t church ju|dicatory, a Church, or Kirk Se&s;&s;ion, their 2d, a Pre&s;bytery, their 3d, a Pro|vincial Synod, their 4th, or highe&s;t, a General A&s;&s;embly of the church of Scotland.</P>
<P>But what &s;imilarity is there between the church of England, and the church of Holland, in their &s;everal offices, judicatories, &amp;c, &amp;c? It is pretended, that the church of Holland makes a di&s;tinction between a meer presbyter, who has only power to preach, and admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, and one who is ordained a member of the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is,</HI> to whom the powers of ordination and government are committed.</P>
<P>This is a meer pretence; for the reader may be a&s;&s;ured, that nothing like it is either known, or practi&s;ed in the church of Hol|land.&mdash;Candidates for the mini&s;try, after they have gone through their nece&s;&s;ary &s;tudies, are pre&s;ented to the cla&s;&s;is; there they are examined not only by the proe&s;es or moderator, but al&s;o by a cer|tain number appointed for that purpo&s;e, or &s;ometimes by the mem|bers in general: When they have given &s;ufficient proofs of their ability, they are licenced to preach in a kind of itinerant way, (but not to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments) to exerci&s;e their talents: When they receive a call for any particular congregation, they are to pa&s;s a &s;econd examination; and after that they are &s;o|lemnly ordained, each one in the pre&s;ence of the congregation of his charge, by prayer, and the laying on of the hands of the cla&s;&s;is, thereunto appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="010857_0110_0F851EDD77A9FC18">
By virtue of this pa&s;toral charge, he is qualified for a member of the cla&s;&s;is to which his congregation doth belong; and where a congregation has more mini&s;ters than is thought needful to &s;end to the cla&s;&s;is, the congregation or con&s;i&s;tory &s;end whom they think proper, from whom they or he mu&s;t have proper credentials.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that a per&s;on is ordained before he is called to a particular charge, or for a foreign place where no cla&s;&s;is is erected. Then, indeed, he is no member of the cla&s;&s;is, not for any defect in his ordination, but becau&s;e he has no con|gregation to repre&s;ent, or no cla&s;&s;is near the place of his mini|&s;try.</P>
<P>Nor can I by any means adopt the parallel of monarchial and epi&s;copalian, republican and pre&s;byterian, or if you plea&s;e church of Holland, church government. It has plea&s;ed God to tolerate &s;everal forms of civil government on earth, and in his word to enjoin obedience to magi&s;trates in general; but it is hard to prove, that he has given &s;o exten&s;ive a toleration in the government of his church, re&s;pecting e&s;&s;entials. It does not therefore follow, that there may be as different church governments in different countries, as there are different civil governments. Neither we of the Dutch church, nor the church of Scotland, blend civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government together, as the church of England does; according to &s;uch parallel it mu&s;t follow, that every ma|gi&s;trate of a city, town or village, in Holland, mu&s;t be of equal rank with their higher order (for I have &s;hewn that there is no &s;uperiority in point of ordination and government in their clergy) and that all, without di&s;tinction, were fit to compo&s;e their coun|cil of &s;tate; their provincial &s;tates, and the &s;tates general of Hol|and We&s;t Vrie&s;land; but this it is obvious is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor can I help ob&s;erving how fruitle&s;s the efforts of your op|ponents, to evade the charge of the epi&s;copalians unchurching all the re&s;t of the reformed churches, by pretending that, as the e&s;teeming republican civil government, le&s;s perfect than monar|chical, is not ungoverning them; &s;o the e&s;teeming the govern|ment of the church of Holland, le&s;s perfect than the epi&s;copa|lian, is not unchurching them.&mdash;The parallel here will not hold; for no man in his &s;en&s;es, will pretend that monarchy is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of government: But the advocates for epi&s;co|pacy in&s;i&s;t, that the ordination, by an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the ordination of go&s;pel mini|&s;ters, that, <Q>that being once broke, not all the men on earth, nor all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, can re&s;tore it.</Q>&mdash;Another &s;ays, <HI>there are three orders in the church of Chri&s;t, bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and dea|cons;
<PB N="220" REF="010857_0111_0F851EDE76271150">and where&s;oever any of the&s;e are wanting, there can be no church.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A hard &s;aying indeed, though &s;aid to be uttered by St. Igna|tius; let us hear, believe, and practi&s;e what the &s;aints or fathers tell us, as far as is agreeable to unerring truth, contained in holy writ; let us be followers of them, as far as they are followers of Chri&s;t. Now an in&s;pired apo&s;tle tells us, that Chri&s;t having a&s;cended on high, hath given &s;ome for apo&s;tles, and &s;ome for pro|phets, and &s;ome for evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome for pa&s;tors and teachers. <HI>Eph. iv. 11.</HI> The three fir&s;t were evidently extraordinary mini&s;|ters, and cea&s;ed with the fir&s;t age of the church, and were de|&s;igned for no longer time, otherwi&s;e the &s;pirit of God would have continued them.&mdash;Between the&s;e extraordinary mini&s;ters, and pa&s;|tors, and teachers, we find none others, con&s;equently no other kind of bi&s;hops or over&s;eers, but pa&s;tors and teachers were ever de&s;igned; and as for Chri&s;tian prie&s;ts, as &s;ome people affect to call the pre&s;by|ters of the church of England, we know the word prie&s;t is no where applied to any mini&s;ter of the new-te&s;tament, but only to all real believers in general, as a royal prie&s;thood in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. <HI>1 Pet. ii, 5, 9. Rev. i. 6.</HI> Let any epi&s;copalian produce a &s;ingle text to the contrary if he can.</NOTE></P>
<P>Con&s;equently as we do not hold epi&s;copal ordination nece&s;&s;ary, we mu&s;t be without mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; we are unbapti&s;ed; we have never partaken of the holy &s;upper, according to Chri&s;t's appointment. In a word, we are almo&s;t in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, and in re&s;pect to ordination, the church of Rome is right; and we indeed, without any peradventure, all in the wrong; and can be no church on earth, whatever &s;ome of us may be in heaven.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of the late Mr. Houdin being received as a prie&s;t of the church of England without re-ordination; it is demanded, by your adver&s;ary, whether on his renouncing the errors of po|pery, and embracing the doctrines of the meeting, they would not have done the &s;ame? Before I an&s;wer this, I mu&s;t examine what the religion of the meeting is. To know this, I mu&s;t exa|mine what meeting they mean. If they mean a meeting-hou&s;e, I believe the materials of lime, &s;tone, wood, &amp;c will not effect the orthodoxy of the hou&s;e; whether they be epi&s;copal or pre&s;|byterian, or even popi&s;h, in regard to the per&s;ons of whom pur|cha&s;ed, or even by whom fabricated; but if by the meeting, they under&s;tand a denomination of Chri&s;tians meeting together; then I ought to know, whether they mean Lutherans, Moravians, Bapti&s;ts, French or Dutch Calvini&s;ts, congregationali&s;ts, quakers, or pre&s;byterians.&mdash;I only know that they do not intend a meeting of epi&s;copalians.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore take it for granted, as the
<PB N="221" REF="010857_0111_0F851EDE76271150">mo&s;t probable that they mean, the meeting or church of pre&s;by|terians here or el&s;ewhere; whom, from a &s;pirit of the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful bigotry, they cannot deign to call any thing el&s;e but meeting independants, di&s;&s;enters, or the like&mdash;any thing but a pre&s;byterian church. But to return to the que&s;tion, I an&s;wer that I &s;incerely think they would not, or at lea&s;t, it is my humbly opinion, they ought not to receive &s;uch a one, without re-ordination, becau&s;e that the church of Rome is &s;o very corrupt and &s;uper&s;titious, as to cea&s;e to be a church of Chri&s;t, but is rather a &s;ynagogue of Satan, and con&s;equently it were better to ordain twice, than not at all. Were an Engli&s;h epi&s;copalian to become a pro&s;elyte to pre&s;byteriani&s;m, it is well known that his ordination would be al|lowed valid, not becau&s;e he was ordained by a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop merely as &s;uch, but becau&s;e he had what we deem the e&s;&s;ential powers of ordination, as any other lawful mini&s;ter, pa&s;tor or over|&s;eer, which in &s;cripture language are &s;ynonimous terms: That every pre&s;byter appointed to the charge of a flock is a bi&s;hop, or over&s;eer, I could ea&s;ily prove from &s;cripture, did the limits of this paper permit.</P>
<P>As the epi&s;copalians them&s;elves &s;ay, that a bi&s;hop is al&s;o a pre&s;byter, they cannot rea&s;onably fault the conduct of the pre&s;by|terians, for allowing the validity of their ordination; &s;eeing they have a right to view the bi&s;hops in the light of pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>But how uncharitably does that boa&s;ted charitable church act towards her prote&s;tant brethren in Scotland, Holland, France, Germany, Geneva, and this exten&s;ive continent of America! For if any one of them; however orthodox and learned, is by any means inclined to become a preacher in their church, nothing el&s;e but a formal re-ordination will qualify him for the mini&s;try in the church of Chri&s;t: What is the language of &s;uch a conduct? Actions &s;peak louder than words.&mdash;Therefore I don't a&s;k what apology they can make, or what charitable con&s;truction they can put on non-epi&s;copal ordination, but what is the language of their actions? 'Tis not <Q>that it is at lea&s;t imperfect, irregular and defective;</Q> tho' Doctor Chandler is plea&s;ed thus to evince the matter, for he &s;ays, <Q>that the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion once broke, and the powers of ordination once lo&s;t, is not to be re&s;tored without an immediate commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t.</Q>&mdash;Neither need the epi&s;copalians (whether really or under colour of charity) to &s;ay, "that the non-epi&s;copalians are in the dark in the&s;e things:" No, we have, ble&s;&s;ed be God, among us, both of clergy and laity, at lea&s;t as clear heads and hone&s;t hearts, as there are among the epi&s;copalians (and doubtle&s;s in greater numbers) who attend to the &s;ure word of prophecy of the old and new-te&s;tament, and give heed thereto, in preference to any fallible &s;ayings of the pious fathers, or traditions of men. The language of their ac|tions
<PB N="222" REF="010857_0112_0F851EDF24531A50">then is this; the per&s;on, or per&s;ons, who pretended to or|dain you, had no legal authority from Chri&s;t &s;o to do, neither you nor they, were lawful mini&s;ters, but intruders and u&s;urpers; the people you mini&s;tered unto were no church, but an unlawful meeting or conventicle.&mdash;Tho' your pretended mini&s;ter warned you of the evil of your ways, God &s;ent him not; and woe to him that runneth not being &s;ent. Thus the epi&s;copalians do as much as in them lies, grieve by their conduct the hearts of tho&s;e whom God will not have grieved; however &s;oft their words; however genteel their apologies. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, a per&s;on to be accu&s;ed of hou&s;e-breaking, and taking thence things of great value; whether the accu&s;ation is true or fal&s;e, will it be deemed a proper apology to &s;ay, I did not de&s;ign to call you a thief; your action was only imperfect, irregular and defective&mdash;you only was in the dark. The application is ea&s;y; all non-epi&s;copalians are guilty of the wor&s;t of thefts, even of &s;acrilege, by laying hands on an ordinance, to which (we epi&s;copalians being judges) they have no right; on the contrary they harden, by the &s;ame conduct, the hearts of many formali&s;ts and hypocrites, who, as the Jews of old, called <Q>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are the&s;e;</Q> &s;o they are ever vainly boa&s;ting, of, "<HI>the church of England, &amp;c. &amp;c. are we.</HI> But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, we have a better te&s;timony of the lawfulne&s;s of the mini&s;try, and the other ordinances among us, than can po&s;&s;i|bly be derived from all the epi&s;copal churches on earth, even the undoubted operation of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of all grace, on the hearts of many to their conver&s;ion and confirmation in their mo&s;t holy faith; and if the epi&s;copal church can boa&s;t its thou&s;ands in this re&s;pect, we may &s;ay we have our ten thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave ju&s;t to mention the ab&s;urd no|tion, and unparall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d bigotry, of u&s;ing the word <HI>church,</HI> as the name of a particular denomination. The lea&s;t that can be &s;aid, of &s;uch people, as that they appear extremely ignorant of the true meaning of the word <HI>church,</HI> by their con&s;tant affectation of calling &s;ome places, dedicated to the public wor&s;hip of God, by the name of meetings and others by that of churches. If they mean, by this term, the buildings where people a&s;&s;emble for di|vine wor&s;hip, they may may be called either churches or meetings, whether the a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ts of epi&s;copalians, or of any other denominations of Chri&s;tians. Thus the building called TRI|NITY CHURCH, is one of the hou&s;es in which epi&s;copalians meet, and con&s;equently it is an epi&s;copalian meeting-hou&s;e, as well or rather more properly than an epi&s;copalian church. But no building &s;trictly &s;peaking can be called a church, being impro|perly &s;o called, from the members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, who there a&s;&s;emble for the public wor&s;hip of God.&mdash;If there|fore
<PB N="223" REF="010857_0112_0F851EDF24531A50">they will not allow the meeting-hou&s;es of bapti&s;ts, pre&s;byte|rians, &amp;c. to be called churches, in the &s;en&s;e ju&s;t mentioned, as well as the epi&s;copalian meeting-hou&s;es, they unwarily (even in an external &s;en&s;e) un-church all tho&s;e other denominations; who, no doubt, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;mall part of the vi&s;ible Chri&s;tian church. Now as to the Dutch church, which I have &s;hewn, may, with the greate&s;t propriety, be called pre&s;byterian, they as effectually un|church it with the re&s;t; becau&s;e no charters, con&s;titutions or con|nections, can con&s;titute any denomination, a church of Chri&s;t. They can only de&s;erve that appellation, as being profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t and his doctrines, agreeing in the unity of &s;aith.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e members of the Dutch church, who have a tolerable under&s;tanding of their con&s;titution, want no &s;uch apologies. We know that the unchurching of any non-epi&s;copalians whatever, who profe&s;s them&s;elves part of the vi&s;ible church, is in effect to unchurch us, as has now been made fully to appear.</P>
<P>How well the holy &s;criptures have been pre&s;erved to us, thro' the medium of the church of Rome, together with the &s;acra|ments and ordination, (or according to the popi&s;h epi&s;copalians phra&s;e, Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood, already refuted) appear by their per|verting the fir&s;t by many corrupt tran&s;lations, adulterating bap|ti&s;m by human inventions, turning the Lord's Supper into the &s;a|crifice of the ma&s;s, the idolatrous doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and making ordination one of their &s;acraments. But the truth is, that God, even in the mid&s;t of popi&s;h darkne&s;s, rai&s;ed up wit|ne&s;&s;es for the truth both of doctrine and di&s;cipline, who &s;ealed the truth with their blood. But probably this &s;et of men have never read the book of Martyrs.</P>
<P>Here I thought to have fini&s;hed, but I cannot help ob&s;erving on the de&s;picable attempt of per&s;uading the public, that Engli&s;h Pre&s;byterians are for unchurching the church of Holland, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is a ba&s;e in&s;inuation without the lea&s;t foundation, and will be treated by every judicious member of the Dutch church, with the contempt it de&s;erves. What do they mean by turning the Dutch churches into conventicles for Engli&s;h independents? if they are men of &s;pirit, let them explain them&s;elves if they dare. We of the the Dutch church, know of many epi&s;copalian bigots, who have &s;tirred up &s;ome of the weaker members of the Dutch church, again&s;t the &s;alutary method of preaching the go&s;pel in the language of the country; and enticed away &s;everal of its members; but in &s;pite of all their art, our gain is more than 10, perhaps 20 to one, to our lo&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, June 16th. <HI>The</HI> CENTINEL. No. XIII.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<P>THERE &s;eems to be &s;omething perver&s;e in human nature, that prompts men to give partial and unfair repre&s;entations, when it &s;uits their purpo&s;e. They conceal truths, extenuate faults, and dimini&s;h or magnify difficulties as it &s;erves their turn, or contributes to carry their de&s;igns into execution. The client loudly proclaims his wrongs, and magnifies his preten&s;ions, while he indu&s;triou&s;ly conceals from his lawyer &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t circum&s;tances that operate again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Doctor Chandler &s;eems in his Appeal, to labour under this in|firmity: he complains that the epi&s;copal church in America &s;uf|fers unparalleled hard&s;hips: he in&s;inuates, that the complaints which he makes are the complaints of a million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in America, &s;uffering under unprecedented hard&s;hips; and that all the epi&s;copal clergy and laity are joint petitioners with him and his friends for an American Epi&s;copate, on the plan he has mentioned. Whereas, in fact, the people were never con&s;ulted on the mea&s;ure, nor were they ever heard to complain. The whole was concerted and curried on by a few mi&s;&s;ionaries (whom the Doctor &s;tiles the clergy) of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey met together in a <HI>voluntary</HI> convention. By what right they a&s;&s;ume &s;uch power it may be well to enquire.</P>
<P>According to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, every part of his maje&s;|ty's exten&s;ive dominions, where governments are e&s;tabli&s;hed, has a power to take care of religion in a way &s;uited to the genius and per&s;ua&s;ion of the people. At the reformation, the Engli&s;h par|liament formed their articles of religion, and inve&s;ted their king with all power, as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical as civil, and modelled church government according to their plea&s;ure. They afterwards by the Act of Toleration made provi&s;ion for di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church. The legi&s;lature of Scotland, (after that kingdom became a branch of the Briti&s;h empire) took care of religion in their own way, and e&s;tabli&s;hed church di&s;cipline on a plan diffe|rent from that of England, which plan was afterwards confirm|ed by the Briti&s;h parliament when both kingdoms were happily united. In Ireland, though the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment be nearly the &s;ame as the Engli&s;h, in wor&s;hip and government, the legi&s;la|ture claim the &s;ole right of e&s;tabli&s;hing articles and canons, and of regulating the affairs of their church as to them &s;eems be&s;t. In &s;ome of the Briti&s;h colonies in America, one religious denomi|nation, in others another denomination of Chri&s;tians have been the peculiar care of the government; while in &s;ome, by the con|&s;titution of the &s;tate, all enjoy equal privileges.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="010857_0114_0F851EE413C130A0">
I would therefore be glad to know by what authority the mi&s;|&s;ionaries of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, in violation of the con|&s;titution of the Briti&s;h governments, and of the rights of their fellow &s;ubjects, u&s;urp a power of acting for all the epi&s;copalians in America; of forming a new plan of epi&s;copacy for them, and of petitioning "our &s;uperiors" in Britain, that this <HI>plan</HI> may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in his maje&s;ty's American colonies by the Briti&s;h legi&s;|lature? Who commi&s;&s;ioned them to act? They will not pretend to &s;ay, they exerci&s;e this power by <HI>Divine Right,</HI> or as inherent in them? Who then, entru&s;ted them with the care of religion in America? Or who, for in&s;tance, empowered them to intermeddle with the &s;tate of it in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands? Do the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per clergy or laity there complain of "unparalleled hard&s;hips?" With regard to the clergy in the i&s;lands, an honourable provi&s;ion is made for their &s;upport by the re&s;pective legi&s;latures. And if the people think them&s;elves aggrieved, they know where to ap|ply for redre&s;s. They have governors and a&s;&s;emblies, in who&s;e power it is to regulate the affairs of the church in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and to rectify what they think ami&s;s in its polity. Or, if they had not this power, is it to be imagined that &s;o re&s;pectable a body of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, were they groaning under into|lerable grievances, as the Doctor repre&s;ents, would not have ad|dre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty, for relief them&s;elves rather than have entru&s;t|ed &s;o important an affair with a few mi&s;&s;ionaries in North-Ame|rica, who are ignorant of their laws and circum&s;tances? Let the world then judge whether the petitions &s;ent home by the mi&s;&s;iona|ries of New-York and the Jer&s;eys, and the Appeal publi&s;hed by Doctor Chandler, as far as they re&s;pect the i&s;lands, are not an in|&s;olent inva&s;ion of the rights of others, and a bu&s;y intermeddling with their laws and con&s;titutions without their con&s;ent or appro|bation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Virginia and Maryland. Have the clergy or laity of the&s;e provinces ever complained of 'unparallel|ed &s;ufferings' or empowered the 'mi&s;&s;ionaries met in a voluntary convention' to complain in their name? Are they not the be&s;t judges, when an epi&s;copate is nece&s;&s;ary, and what plan of epi&s;co|pacy will be&s;t &s;uit them&s;elves? At lea&s;t are they not as good judges as the members of the convention at Amboy? If an epi&s;|copate be nece&s;&s;ary to "ordain, and govern the clergy and to ad|mini&s;ter confirmation to &s;uch as &s;hall apply for it," the common appendages of epi&s;copacy are not nece&s;&s;ary; but may and mu&s;t be varied, as the laws and con&s;titutions of different governments may require. And to the body of the people, to the a&s;&s;emblies and governors does it belong to regulate the&s;e appendages. The&s;e governments have provided for the maintainance of the clergy, in a way mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves, and when they think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="228" REF="010857_0115_0F851EE429C43AF0">to have a bi&s;hop, they will, doubtle&s;s, fall upon mea&s;ures to have one. But what right the mi&s;&s;ionaries of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey have to publi&s;h complaints in the name of the&s;e peo|ple, while they them&s;elves are &s;ilent, or to repre&s;ent their &s;uffer|ings as intolerable and their grievances as unparalleled, while they them&s;elves expre&s;s no unea&s;ine&s;s, I cannot well comprehend.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;umption of the convention which voluntarily met at Amboy, and took upon them&s;elves to act as repre&s;entatives of all the members of the Engli&s;h epi&s;copalians in America, &s;eems greatly heightened when we con&s;ider, fir&s;t, that it was illegal according to the canons of their church; &s;econdly, that none of the laity met in it; and, thirdly, that it was compo&s;ed of but a part of the mi&s;&s;ionaries. Not above one, or at the mo&s;t two of the epi&s;copal clergy in Penn&s;ylvania (if I am well informed) met in convention, or were taken into their con&s;ultations; and very few from New-England. The epi&s;copal clergy in Penn&s;ylvania are men of too much under&s;tanding to complain without rea&s;on, and too well acquainted with the charter and laws of the pro|vince, not to know that they enjoy the &s;ame liberty as any other religious denomination. They claim no &s;uperiority over their fellow Chri&s;tians, nor do they con&s;ider them&s;elves in a &s;tate of per&s;ecution, merely becau&s;e they are not e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of par|liament, and their opinions and practices made a &s;tate religion in preference to all others. They know that a difference in reli|gion does not deprive a &s;ubject of his 'natural right to any civil or military power.' And as to the laity they are contented with the privileges which they enjoy in common with their fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Should any one a&s;k who the&s;e gentlemen are that met in this voluntary convention, and a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves &s;uch mighty powers; I blu&s;h to think of the an&s;wer that mu&s;t be given. Cer|tainly &s;ome re&s;pect &s;hould have been had to governors, to the members of his Maje&s;ty's council, to the repre&s;entatives of the people in a&s;&s;emblies met. They at lea&s;t ought to have been con|&s;ulted; before application was made to his Maje&s;ty for an epi&s;co|pate, and before a plan was concluded on different from what was ever known in the Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>It might have derogated too much from the dignity of this vo|luntary convention, to have con&s;ulted with <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> on the occa|&s;ion, yet where tho&s;e who reject epi&s;copacy are more than thirty or forty for one that prefers it&mdash;as is the ca&s;e in &s;ome of the Ea&s;t|ern governments, thinking people will admit that &s;ome regard &s;hould be had to them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, then, it is evident, that neither the addre&s;&s;es reque&s;ting an epi&s;copate, nor the bitter and indecent complaints, of unprecedented hard&s;hips and unparalelled &s;ufferings are the
<PB N="229" REF="010857_0115_0F851EE429C43AF0">voice of the clergy and laity of the epi&s;copal churches in Ameri|ca: Neither do they complain of a want of government becau&s;e they have not a bi&s;hop re&s;iding among them. Agreeable to the con&s;titution of their church, they con&s;ider them&s;elves under the care of the Bi&s;hop of London as their pa&s;tor, and the king as the &s;upreme head of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. Their wor&s;hip they regulate by the canons and rubries, their di&s;cipline by the laws of the community to which they belong, and their faith by the articles of the church of England. The di&s;tance of their go|vernors does not in their opinion de&s;troy the regularity of their government, nor tempt them to demand a change; and until the Doctor convinces us that <HI>near a million</HI> of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in Ame|rica have commi&s;&s;ioned him and his a&s;&s;ociates to petition and com|plain, we mu&s;t vindicate &s;o re&s;pectable a body from the proceed|ings of the <HI>convention,</HI> who by a&s;&s;uming an authority and power never delegated to them, would pa&s;s them&s;elves upon the world for men of importance.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE per&s;on who is injured and per&s;ecuted, naturally becomes the object of attention and pity.&mdash;The man who will not &s;upport and &s;uccour afflicted virtue, de&s;erves to be afflicted with|out &s;uccour or &s;upport. Such con&s;iderations as the&s;e may plead
<PB N="230" REF="010857_0116_0F851EE5E4F326F8">my excu&s;e, while I take the liberty to addre&s;s the public in favour of the Rev Dr. Bradbury Chandler, who has been mal-treated and cruelly abu&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by a certain writer, who &s;tiles him|&s;elf the CENTINEL. Not that I have any doubt of the Doctor's Ap|peal to the Public carrying conviction wherever it finds its way; but as many people may read the Centinel who have not &s;een the Appeal, and may thence form prejudices again&s;t the gentlemen who have been promoting a church e&s;tabli&s;hment in this country, it &s;eems proper that they &s;hould be pre&s;ented with the &s;um of tho&s;e arguments, which may be offered in favour of an American bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>After &s;o eminent a writer as the Rev. Dr. Chandler, the reader is not to expect that I &s;hould offer any new arguments on the &s;ubject.
<Q>Mecum habito &amp; Novi quam &s;it mihi curta &s;upellex.</Q>
I &s;hall be contented with treading faithfully in the Doctor's foot|&s;teps, taking his arguments as they &s;tand, or &s;ometimes abbrevi|ating, at other times enlarging them, &s;o as to place them in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light, and upon the&s;e arguments we are de|termined to re&s;t our cau&s;e; they are the &s;entiments of a general convention of our clergy, publi&s;hed after the mature&s;t deliberation, therefore as we do not think any new arguments are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport our cau&s;e, &s;o are we determined not to de&s;ert one of tho&s;e which we have already advanced.&mdash;The prayer of our petition is to this import, "That his maje&s;ty and the Briti&s;h parliament would graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to &s;end over to America one or more bi&s;hops of the church of England, and make &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment for their maintainance, &amp;c. as may be &s;uited to the rank and dig|nity of their office." Who could have imagined that any objection would have been made to a &s;cheme &s;o moderate and rea&s;onable as this? a &s;cheme which mu&s;t be equally profitable to church and &s;tate. It may be of great u&s;e towards pre&s;erving the obedience and loyalty of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in North-America, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry towards the very exi&s;tence of Chri&s;tiani|ty in this part of the world. That &s;uch is the importance of an American epi&s;copate, Dr. Chandler has effectually proved to eve|ry per&s;on, who is not hardened again&s;t conviction by the ob&s;ti|nate prejudices of education.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary towards the propagation of Chri&s;tia|nity in America, that bi&s;hops be immediately &s;ent over to the&s;e parts. "for it is (&s;ays the Doctor) an e&s;&s;ential doctrine of the church of England, that none can have any authority in the church of Chri&s;t, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t immediate|ly or mediately. They who receive the authority immediately mu&s;t prove their mi&s;&s;ion by working miracles. Tho&s;e who receive
<PB N="231" REF="010857_0116_0F851EE5E4F326F8">it mediately mu&s;t derive it from tho&s;e per&s;ons whom Chri&s;t has authorized to convey it, i. e. they mu&s;t receive it by regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. Men may ridicule the notion of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion as they plea&s;e, but if the authority of the clergy is derived from Chri&s;t, (and if it is not, they are no mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t) they mu&s;t receive it in one of the ways already mentioned, and if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion be once broke, and the power of ordination once lo&s;t&mdash;not all the men on earth, not all the angels in heaven, without an immediate commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t, can re&s;tore it." p. 4th.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons therefore who call them&s;elves mini&s;ters, unle&s;s they be truly originated from this immaculate, uninterrupted line, are impo&s;tors and no mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. 'It is as great an ab&s;urdity on St. Paul's principles, for a man to preach the go&s;pel without being properly &s;ent, as for a man to hear without a preacher, or believe in him of whom they have not heard.' Therefore as the teachers who are not ordained by a bi&s;hop, or &s;ent by him cannot po&s;&s;ibly preach the go&s;pel, &s;o neither can the people hear the go&s;pel from them. And where there are no preachers of the go&s;pel, nor any hearers, there can hardly be any Chri&s;tianity. It there be any nations then who have no public teachers duly &s;ent by apo&s;tolic bi&s;hops, we are not to think that Chri&s;tianity &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e nations. Hence we &s;ee the &s;ingular propriety with which Doctor Chandler di&s;tingui&s;hes his American epi&s;copalians by the name of the Church, the American Church, the Church in A|merica I confe&s;s he might have avoided this &s;eeming tautology, by calling them at once the Chri&s;tians in America, or the Chri|&s;tian church in America; not that he has entirely neglected this accurate di&s;tinction, for page 113 he tells us, 'that the cau&s;e of the church of England in America is the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity,' and who el&s;e are entituled to the name of Chri&s;tians? What other church (that of Rome excepted) has a Chri&s;tian mini&s;try? The churches of Denmark and Sweden, the Lutherans and Calvani&s;ts in Germany, the churches of Geneva, Holland and Scotland, are nothing but &s;hadows of churches; they have for&s;aken, they have &s;hut out the light of Chri&s;tianity by rejecting the go&s;pel mini&s;try through the only channel of conveyance, the unbroken &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. When I think of tho&s;e millions of &s;ouls who in this enlight|ened age, &s;uffer them&s;elves to peri&s;h without benefit of clergy, my compa&s;&s;ion is &s;tirred up, my heart is moved within me.</P>
<P>The pious Mr. Dodwell in his one prie&s;thood, expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf in this elegant manner, 'It is,' &s;ays he, 'the mo&s;t dreadful aggravation of the condemnation of the damned, that they are bani&s;hed from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. The &s;ame is their condition al&s;o who are di&s;united from Chri&s;t by being di&s;united from the bi&s;hop, his vi&s;ible repre&s;entative.'</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="010857_0117_0F851EE6677BF4B8">
Some people who abound in a kind of fal&s;e charity, &s;uch as would pre&s;ently &s;ap the foundations of the church, will here a&s;k, What then do we make of all Prote&s;tant nations be&s;ides the Eng|gli&s;h? Do we in very deed deny them the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and con&s;ign them to the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever? To this we &s;hall only an&s;wer by repeating what the Doctor has already &s;aid, The nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copal ordination is an e&s;&s;ential doctrine of our church.&mdash;.They who have it not are no Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters: As this is the truth, we are bound to maintain it, let the con&s;e|quences be what they may; we are not accountable for tho&s;e, more than for the fate of the Mahometans, &s;ince they al&s;o have Chri&s;tianity in their offer, but ob&s;tinately re&s;u&s;e to accept of it; and if the Prote&s;tant nations in Europe &s;uffer them&s;elves to peri&s;h without the mini&s;tration of the go&s;pel, they are &s;o much the more unpardonable, as a very little care would render it univer|&s;al. We do not &s;ay that tho&s;e people are deficient in a general acquaintance with the Chri&s;tian religion; nor that they fail in piety, benevolence, charity, or any other moral or Chri&s;tian-like virtue. But they have rejected or lo&s;t epi&s;copal ordination, which alone can re&s;tore them to the fellow&s;hip of the church, and entitle them to her ble&s;&s;ings. But how &s;hall they who live in dark|ne&s;s, &s;hut out from the benign influence of a go&s;pel mini&s;try, re|ceive this invaluable ble&s;&s;ing? Their duty is plain; they may readily obtain from England &s;uppo&s;e it were but one or two bi|&s;hops, and even as a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, &s;o will the&s;e bi&s;hops in a &s;hort time convey genuine ordination to all the clergy in a whole kingdom.</P>
<P>Having thus proved the general nece&s;&s;ity of bi&s;hops, towards the exi&s;tence of Chri&s;tanity, I &s;hall next &s;hew that they are peculiarly ne|ce&s;&s;ary in America. For &s;ince there can be no Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters without epi&s;copal ordination, it is plain that our clergy mu&s;t either have bi&s;hops to ordain them here, or they mu&s;t go to Eng|land for ordination; but the latter is ab&s;olutely impracticable, con&s;idering the dangers of the &s;eas.&mdash;It has happened, I don't know by what fatality, ever &s;ince the affair of Jonah, that the clergy have been &s;ingularly unfortunate at &s;ea. This is al&s;o a general ob&s;ervation of &s;eamen, who doubtle&s;s are the be&s;t judges in that ca&s;e, <HI>There have gone home for ordination from the north|ern colonies fifty-two; of tho&s;e, forty-two have returned &s;afe, and ten have</HI> MISCARRIED. Page 34. What a melancholy lo&s;s is here; little le&s;s than 20 per Cent. which is eight times as great as our lo&s;s on the &s;everal kinds of merchandize which we gene|rally import. This plainly evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of having an A|merican bi&s;hop.

But the care of the Negroes, the Indians and the white peo|ple in general, furni&s;hes us with &s;o many di&s;tinct arguments in favour of an American bi&s;hop.&mdash;We &s;hall con&s;ider them apart.&mdash;The cau&s;e of an American epi&s;copate derives a power|ful argument from the &s;tate of the Negroes, who con&s;titute the majority of tho&s;e numerous &s;ouls, that fill up and adorn our li&s;t as members of the church in America. The number of blacks in the i&s;lands and colonies is above eight hundred and forty thou|&s;and. The&s;e Negroes may be faid in an imperfect &s;en&s;e to belong to the re&s;pective religious cla&s;&s;es of their owners with whom they are connected, and by whom they are governed. So that what|ever is the religion of the ma&s;ter, that al&s;o may be called the re|ligion of the &s;lave. But the ma&s;ters are chiefly known to be churchmen; con&s;equently above half a million of Negroes belong to the church of England. Such have been the fruitful labours of our mi&s;&s;ionaries, &s;uch the rapid increa&s;e of our church in this part of the world. Now though it is generally known that the&s;e &s;laves are brought up in ignorance without any ray of religious hope to cheer them, and to the eternal di&s;grace of teachers and ma&s;ters are no Chri&s;tians at all, yet as the &s;en&s;e of religion will certainly increa&s;e in their ma&s;ters by the pre&s;ence of a bi&s;hop, &s;o it will al&s;o increa&s;e in the &s;laves, and the good work which we have &s;o happily begun, will then be carried on to the de&s;ired per|&s;ection. Page 57. To illu&s;triate this, let us &s;uppo&s;e a bi&s;hop &s;et|tled in Philadelphia, his pious influence would &s;oon diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of religion, as well through all the neighbouring provinces as this city. Then we might expect in a &s;hort time to equal that purity of morals, and that religious di&s;po&s;ition, which is generally ob&s;erved in London and other great cities, that have providen|tially become the re&s;idence of a bi&s;hop. Suppo&s;e then a bi&s;hop were &s;ettled in Philadelphia, the planters in Jamaica and the other We&s;t-India i&s;lands, being under his Lord&s;hip's immediate ob&s;er|vation, would &s;oon become very &s;ober and religious, and con&s;e|quently their Negroes, who are in general a di&s;creet, intelligent &s;ort of people, would, in imitation of their ma&s;ters, become re|ligious and good Chri&s;tians. Whoever is well acquainted with the condition of &s;laves in our Southern provinces and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, and has ob&s;erved the compa&s;&s;ionate manner in which their ma&s;ters expre&s;s their de&s;ire of &s;eeing tho&s;e out-ca&s;ts of hu|manity in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian religion, mu&s;t readily &s;ee the force of this argument, and though illiterate Americans in gene|ral may not be able to comprehend it, yet we are per&s;uaded that our &s;uperiors in England, for whom, by the way, Dr. Chandler's Addre&s;s was chiefly de&s;igned, will ea&s;ily perceive its weight, and will &s;ee that &s;o glorious a pro&s;pect of adding half a million of church|men to the Chri&s;tian church, proves beyond all doubt, the nece&s;|&s;ity of an American bi&s;hop.</P>

<P>IT is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that a writer of a weekly piece, who confines him&s;elf to no order, &s;purns at truth, and de&s;pi&s;es rea&s;on and argumentation, &s;hould be &s;o &s;oon obliged to recur to a figure of rhetoric, called, repetition, to fill up his abu&s;ive pa|per: That this is a fact, is evident to every impartial reader, of Num. VIII. of the American Whig, in which there is nothing but what he &s;aid before, except his hi&s;torical account of the re|formation, and the origin of the di&s;&s;enters in England;&mdash;this I mu&s;t confe&s;s is new, very new, &s;o intirely new, that I am con|fident it owes its exi&s;tence to the fruitful invention of the Ameri|can Whig. To evince this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall now exhibit to the public an account of the occa&s;ion and ri&s;e of the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;ent|ers, not indeed quite &s;o new, but rather more true; and dare ap|peal to all the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, (except Neil, who&s;e veracity &s;tands upon no better foundation, than his friend's, the American Whig,) for a confirmation of what I advance.</P>
<P>Henry the VIIIth, was &s;o far from being a reformer, that he continued a zealous, and per&s;ecuting Papi&s;t to his death. He aimed at nothing more than the gratification of his lu&s;t and am|bition;&mdash; and in order that he might indulge him&s;elf without controul, he &s;hook off the Papal authority, and enriched him&s;elf by &s;eizing the revenues of the church. Under his &s;on Edward VI. the reformation made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s, but was far from complete, when it plea&s;ed God, who is un&s;earchable in his judgments, to deprive the nation of &s;o pious and aimiable a prince, and the Romi&s;h religion was again introduced, under the influence and power of the bigotted tyrant Mary; who rai&s;ed a per&s;ecution again&s;t the reformed, equal to any that the primitive Church &s;uffered from the Heathen emperors. Many pious and learned clergymen of the reformed church of England, as well bi&s;hops as pre&s;byters, were put to the mo&s;t cruel death; and many clergymen who&s;e courage was not equal to their piety and learning, left the kingdom and &s;heltered them&s;elves in various parts of Europe, e&s;pecially at Geneva, where they contracted a love and e&s;teem for the Genevan di&s;cipline, &amp;c.&mdash;When Queen Elizabeth, of glorious memory, came to the throne, a &s;ufficient number of men of abilities and learning, to &s;upply the pari&s;hes that had been vacated by Mary's per&s;ecution, was not to be found;
<PB N="235" REF="010857_0118_0F851EE7232AE248">which occa&s;ioned the temporary in&s;titution of non-preaching mi|ni&s;ters. Tho&s;e that had left their livings, which were now filled in the be&s;t manner the times would permit, finding all ea&s;y and quiet at home, returned, and demanded to be re&s;tored to their old pari&s;hes. But as they had de&s;erted their flocks in the time of danger, it was thought unju&s;t to turn out the pre&s;ent incumbents, to make room for them. Thus di&s;appointed, they became di&s;|contented, and began to &s;et up for a more pure and thorough re|formation, and took the name of Puritans. In a little time they became &s;omewhat trouble&s;ome, but were too plous and well di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;eperate from the church.</P>
<P>While things were in this &s;ituation, the Roman Catholics at home and abroad, e&s;pecially the Je&s;uits, were very indu&s;trious in making u&s;e of every means in their power, to ob&s;truct and di&s;|grace the reformation. Always fruitful in invention, it occured to them, that they might avail them&s;elves of the in&s;trumentality of the Puritans, to &s;ow divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities among the re|formed in England. A &s;warm of Je&s;uits therefore embarked in the artful de&s;ign of fomenting the di&s;content of the Puritans. The&s;e adepts in art and cunuing, fir&s;t broached the novel &s;cheme of a parity of mini&s;ters; and all the other peculiarities of the di&s;|&s;entors. The&s;e were the hopeful heads under who&s;e banner they li&s;ted; the "variety of leaders," under whom they "&s;plit into all that diver&s;ity of per&s;ua&s;ion," which has been "&s;o favourable to liberty and philo&s;ophy."</P>
<P>The Whig in this &s;ame number, with his u&s;ual good nature, &s;till affects to treat as trifles, the hard&s;hips under which the church in America labours;&mdash;the danger of cro&s;&s;ing and re-cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic, is nothing with this heroic gentleman.&mdash;The ex|pence is an advantage; and if it was greater "the church would be better &s;ecured again&s;t an old complaint of the Jews; that prie&s;ts were made of the meane&s;t of the people"&mdash;The Jewi&s;h prie&s;thood was confined by divine in&s;titution to one family, viz. Aaron's. No per&s;on of this family was too mean to make a prie&s;t of. Jeroboam, indeed, who, by his &s;chi&s;m and idolatry made I&s;rael to &s;in, did make prie&s;ts of the meane&s;t of the people. He, like &s;ome in the&s;e days, paid no regard to the in&s;titution of God, but &s;et up a parity of families. Let this wicked proceeding be at|tended by tho&s;e whom it concerns.</P>
<P>In the Jewi&s;h church, by God's expre&s;s appointment, there was a di&s;parity of clergy.&mdash;High prie&s;ts, prie&s;ts and Levites; and as the Jewi&s;h church was typical of the Chri&s;tian, po&s;&s;ibly no great ab&s;urdity will follow from &s;uppo&s;ing that God has done the &s;ame in the Chri&s;tian church; and that bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons, are of divine in&s;titution. If the American Whig, and his a&s;&s;ociates, are &s;o wilfully blind, that they will not &s;ee this, I
<PB N="236" REF="010857_0119_0F851EE7EE7E86E0">cannot help it: however I can pray for them, that they may have <HI>eyes that can &s;ee&mdash;ears that can hear, and hearts that can un|der&s;tand;</HI> &mdash;that they may <HI>be converted</HI> from the <HI>error</HI> of their ways, and that God <HI>may heal them.</HI></P>
<P>Our &s;agacious Whig &s;uppo&s;es, either the pre&s;byterian form of church government, was in&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles; or el&s;e that every community of people were left at liberty to take &s;uch a form of church government as they thought mo&s;t convenient for them.</P>
<P>Upon this la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition (which &s;eems to be his real opinion) he can't po&s;&s;ibly have any ju&s;t ground of quarrel with the church of England, for preferring the epi&s;copal form; for had they not the &s;ame right to take this form, that the church of Scotland had to take the pre&s;byterian form? For this writer then to oppo&s;e and calum|niate the church in the &s;hameful manner he does, is real and direct per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But if his opinion is, that the pre&s;byterian form was in&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles, and that epi&s;copacy is an abberration from the truth; I beg the candid reader to con&s;ider, that the American Whig admits that epi&s;copacy "prevailed" (if he had &s;aid univer|&s;ally, he would have &s;poken the truth for once) from "the days of St. Ignatius to Calvin; an interval of not le&s;s than 1400 years." He al&s;o admits "That the fir&s;t ages of the church, be|fore <HI>the Scarlet Whore had defiled the Nations,</HI>" furni&s;hed "in|&s;tances of martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors," who "con&s;idered a prie&s;t as a bi&s;hop's inferior."&mdash;How came the&s;e holy men of old to con|&s;ider a prie&s;t as a bi&s;hop's in&s;erior, unle&s;s that was really the ca&s;e by Apo&s;tolic in&s;titution? Did not the&s;e primitive martyrs and con|fe&s;&s;ors under&s;tand the con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian church as well as the Whigs and Independents of our day?&mdash;How was it po&s;&s;ible that the whole church, which even in the Apo&s;tles time, was di&s;per&s;ed over a great part of the Roman empire, &s;hould at once for&s;ake the pre&s;byterian form of church government (if that was the orginal form) and become epi&s;copalians, within &s;o &s;hort a period as the time of St. Ignatius; and not one hone&s;t pre&s;byte|rian to oppo&s;e the abominable corruption and apo&s;tacy? How comes it to pa&s;s, that this univer&s;al degeneracy &s;hould never be noticed by one &s;ingle hi&s;torian of tho&s;e times, who have been mi|nute enough to tran&s;mit affairs of much le&s;s importance?&mdash; As to Lord Chancellor King's &s;cheme which is &s;o often and au|daciou&s;ly referred to by the advocates of the pre&s;byterian form of church government, it was fully confuted by the Rev. Mr. Slater, in a book, intitled&mdash;<HI>An Original Draught of the primitive Church,</HI> to which neither Lord Chancellor King (nor any one el&s;e, that I recollect) ever made any reply. The&s;e two valuable books&mdash;<HI>King's Inquiry,</HI> and <HI>Slater's original Draught,</HI> I would recommend to any per&s;on, that has a mind to examine into this
<PB N="237" REF="010857_0119_0F851EE7EE7E86E0">Controver&s;y. Truth fears no examination; I therefore heartily wi&s;h every candid and impartial per&s;on among us, would read and &s;earch for him&s;elf; and then I am confident, he would be convinced, whatever &s;uch paltry &s;cribblers as the American Whig, and his whole band of auxiliaries, may &s;ay, or write, that epi&s;copacy is of Apo&s;tolic in&s;titution; and con&s;equently, that it is their duty to &s;ubmit to it, as an appointment and ordinance of God.</P>

<P>FINDING that neither argument, truth or decency, are to be expected from your doughty antagoni&s;t, the American Whig, I beg leave to exhibit to the public (with your permi&s;&s;ion) the fol|lowing very plain truths; not being in the lea&s;t afraid of his feeble pen, or his malice, however con&s;picuous it may appear.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, PLAIN TRUTH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="list of statements">
<P N="1">I. THAT the American independents (ever fond of oppo&s;i|tion) do every thing (tho' they labour in vain) to prevent an American epi&s;copate,&mdash;is true.</P>
<P N="2">II. That neither their weak arguments, their fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, or feeble efforts will prevent it,&mdash;is true.</P>
<P N="3">III. That a truly primitive bi&s;hop, &s;uch a one as Dr. in his Appeal reque&s;ts, would greatly promote the intere&s;t of re|ligion in general, and of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church in particular, is &mdash;&s;o true; that even the American Whig, though mad with pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t advert to it:&mdash;Con&s;equently, that he will avail him&s;elf of every fal&s;ehood and &s;ubtilty he is ma&s;ter of (and he has a large budget) to impede and retard &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, is,&mdash;a truth that cannot be denied.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That all abu&s;ive &s;cribblers, republicans in principle,&mdash; &s;tirers up of &s;trife,&mdash;and pe&s;ts to &s;ociety, ought, by every well-wi&s;her to our happy con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, to be treated with contempt, and mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;ed,&mdash;is true.</P>
<P N="5">V. That a particular abu&s;ive Junto, ju&s;tly celebrated for their arrogance, fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, and abu&s;ive papers; viz, the Independ|ent Reflector, Watch Tower, &amp;c.&mdash;(to &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent of &s;ome other performances, which contain many &s;candalous fal|&s;ities, as will e'er long appear) have been, and now are endea|vouring to &s;pread their poi&s;on, and debauch the principles of his Maje&s;ty's leige &s;ubjects in America, is a truth well known to the mo&s;t con&s;iderate and principal inhabitants of this city.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="238" REF="010857_0120_0F851EE8A625ABB8">
VI. That &s;aid Junto never yet did, and it is to be feared never will, act an hone&s;t and upright part;&mdash;or, confine them|&s;elves within the bounds of truth, decency, or good manners,&mdash; is true.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That the friends to epi&s;copacy mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;e the low de&s;picable threats;&mdash;the paultry performances of a dejected, di&s;appointed, and tottering faction,&mdash;is true.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That the Whig, and his party, public incendiaries, have by far, more rea&s;on to dread di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, than hone&s;t friend Tickle,&mdash;is true.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, begun by tho&s;e that are enemies to peace, will be dropt, as &s;oon as re&s;tle&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ed, ma|licious faction will cea&s;e from their ho&s;tilities, and be quiet,&mdash; is true: But, not 'till then.</P>
<P N="10">X. That the Whig, No. IX. was de&s;ignedly wrote to blind the eyes of a worthy member of the ancient Dutch church in this city, is&mdash;very true.&mdash;That it was al&s;o wrote in the Dutch language, for fear of an an&s;wer, the Whig knows to be true; but that the author will be di&s;appointed in this, I know&mdash; is true.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That if the Meagre Whig, or any of his a&s;&s;ociates, (I will not exclude even Dr. Ramchicken,) will oblige the public with a piece (they are all learned men) in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin, they &s;hall be honoured with an an&s;wer, in the &s;ame language, by hone&s;t Timothy Tickle, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> or one of his corre&s;pondents,&mdash; is true.</P>
<P N="12">XII.

<P>SUCH is the nature of human actions, that their &s;ecret &s;prings are not always knowable, &s;ave only to their authors, and the great Searcher of hearts; the &s;ole rule for judging of other men's motives, is by arguing from the effect to the cau&s;e, and by exa|mining an action, to trace it, if po&s;&s;ible, to the principle which in|&s;pired its agent.&mdash;But though the characters of human actions are &s;eldom &s;o clear and di&s;tinct, e&s;pecially when di&s;gui&s;e is u&s;ed, as to expre&s;s with certainly, the real &s;ources from which they flow; there is neverthele&s;s a material difference, between a good and a true rea&s;on; not only as actually exi&s;ting in the nature of things, but as di&s;coverable by experience. And though it is often difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them, yet a di&s;cerning eye will fre|quently mark their di&s;criminations, with &s;ufficient certainty. This, however, is a ta&s;k rarely to be performed by common ob|&s;ervers. Hence the wide&s;t door is opened for deceit, on almo&s;t e|very &s;ubject in life. But religion, above all others, furni&s;hes the mo&s;t ample field for abu&s;e. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> how much &s;oever the corrupti|ons of human nature may have warped our hearts and practice from virtue, it &s;till recommends it&s;elf to the under&s;tanding; and with tho&s;e who are unable to di&s;tingui&s;h, it is enough that a &s;cheme is urged by religious motives, to gain a ready, and often times, an implicit a&s;&s;ent. True it is, that as the world is grown more enlightened, impo&s;tors mu&s;t put on better di&s;gui&s;es than formerly.&mdash;When in times of Yore, a cry was rai&s;ed for the heathen godde&s;s Diana of Ephe&s;us, again&s;t the pure and undefiled religion of Je&s;us, it was attended with an expre&s;s avowal of the true rea&s;on for which it was rai&s;ed, "by this craft we get our wealth." But our modern God-makers, find them&s;elves obliged to conceal their real motives; and when my Lord Bi&s;hop is to be the Idol in America, when the &s;eheme is to aggrandize the church, and to introduce prelacy, from which our ance&s;tors fled as from a devouring mon&s;ter, we are told it is the cau&s;e of religi|on; and are excited to a compliance, by an addre&s;s to our grati|tude, in behalf of the great Author of all our benefits. Of this prie&s;tly cant and jargon, Dr. Chande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in his appeal, has fur|ni&s;hed us with a rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kable in&s;tance. Let him &s;peak for him&s;elf. "As America is the region, wherein the divine goodne&s;s has been more remarkably di&s;played, in favour of the Briti&s;h nation; &s;o America is evidently the very ground, on which &s;ome &s;uitable monuments of religious gratitude &s;hould be erected." To be &s;ure
<PB N="241" REF="010857_0121_0F851EE965DF7328"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">enial of this propo&s;ition, would be a flat rejection of all obli|gations to the deity. Nor will he be contradicted in the a&s;&s;ertion, that this monument of religious gratitude "&s;hould be made vi&s;ible to the world; that the honour of the &s;upreme ruler of events may be thereby immediately promoted." The&s;e &s;entiments would afford ju&s;t cau&s;e, in the judgment of every man, for applying to tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the directions of our public affairs, for e&s;tabli&s;hing an anniver&s;ary thank&s;giving, to be celebrated in all the epi&s;copalian and non-epi&s;copalian churches in the nation. But a per&s;on of le&s;s &s;agacity than the Doctor, could never have inve&s;tigated &s;o &s;ingular a rea&s;on, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;co|pacy and &s;piritual bondage, in this land of religious liberty, as the &s;miles of providence, in the reduction of Canada and Loui&s;i|ana, and "the total annihilation of that power on this continent, whereby our former &s;afety was chiefly endangered." Nor will he meet with any oppo&s;ition to his other general a&s;&s;ertion, that every wi&s;e nation &s;ees and acknowledges the hand of God, in the produc|tion of &s;uch events; and that every religious nation will endea|vour to make &s;ome &s;uitable returns, for &s;uch extraordinary fa|vours." But whether tho&s;e returns ought to con&s;i&s;t in the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, of any religious denomination in particular, is a matter which mu&s;t undergo all the freedom of enquiry. If there be any force or conclu&s;ion in his argument, it plainly con&s;i&s;ts in this po&s;ition, that epi&s;copacy and not Chri&s;tianity is the nation|al religion. This is evidently implied in that bright chain of rea&s;oning, which, to do it full ju&s;tice, my readers &s;hall have in his own words. After having excited our gratitude, and called for public te&s;timonials, in honour to the deity; he argues thus; "as this honour is mo&s;t directly promoted by public wor&s;hip; as that wor&s;hip mu&s;t be mo&s;t acceptable to him, wherein the prai&s;es and adorations of his creatures are regularly offered him, in the &s;olemn offices of the pure&s;t and be&s;t religion; and as the nation|al religion mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to an&s;wer the&s;e characters, in the national opinion;" it nece&s;&s;arily follows, (mark the conclu&s;ion) that the &s;tate of the "national religion here, has a right on this occa&s;ion, to the peculiar attention and con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with the direction of our public affairs." The &s;ame argument would doubtle&s;s be as conclu&s;ive, in the mouth of a mu&s;&s;elman, and in an addre&s;s to the Grand Signor. It is not a plea for Chri&s;tianity. It is a claim for di&s;tinction, in favou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the national religion. For it cannot be denied that all other re|ligious denominations among us, except Judai&s;m, are at lea&s;t as zealous profe&s;&s;ors of the religion of Je&s;us, as tho&s;e of the Doctor's per&s;ua&s;ion, which he is plea&s;ed to call the national religion; that the doctrines they profe&s;s are as pure Chri&s;tianity, as tho&s;e which the &s;urpliced clergy mo&s;t &s;olemnly &s;ub&s;cribe and &s;eldom preach
<PB N="242" REF="010857_0122_0F851EEA1E39F9E0">will require no other proof than an attendance at their numerous places of publie wor&s;hip; and that they are far from being le&s;s re|markable for promoting the honour of God by a &s;tated attendance at publi wor&s;hip, than their epi&s;copal brethren in England and America, is an undoubted fact. There cannot therefore be a de|fect of public te&s;timonials of gratitude, to the God of all our mer|cies, ari&s;ing from the want of a &s;tated and regular &s;upport of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip among us. Hence al&s;o it is clear, that the rea|&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in America is not, that its doctrines are more pure, the practice of its profe&s;&s;ors more virtuous, or their attendance at public wor&s;hip more regular and unterrupted, than tho&s;e of other denominations; or in other words, that the church of England, is properly, and exclu&s;ively the church of Chri&s;t; in which alone, all true Chri&s;tians mu&s;t allow the honour of God can be duly promoted; but becau&s;e it is, as the Doctor a&s;&s;erts, the national religion, that reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on which is &s;o far at lea&s;t removed from Chri&s;tian purity, that by his own confe&s;tion, her eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal laws, liturgy, and public offices, require a review, and would have had it e'er now "were the body of the nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good &s;en&s;e enough to admit of it."</P>
<P>But at all events the Doctor is involved in this dilemma; he mu&s;t either be under&s;tood, as a&s;&s;erting, that the honour of God cannot be duly promoted in America, for want of that Chri&s;tian purity and perfection, to which we are now &s;trangers; and which cannot be introduced among us, but by the means of epi&s;copacy; or, that the honour of God is not &s;o much promoted by the pu|rity and perfection of a Chri&s;tian church, as by a national e&s;ta|bli&s;ament of religion, however corrupt it may appear to be, if te&s;ted by the &s;acred oracles, the divine canon of Scripture. With re&s;pect to the former of the&s;e propo&s;itions, I &s;hall think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in &s;uppo&s;ing that he rejects it, until he &s;hall think proper expre&s;sly to maintain it; that he avows the other cannot be deni|ed, while, though he admits, that the national church &s;tands in need of a review, to bring it to the &s;tandard of true Chri&s;tianity; he, neverthele&s;s, attempts to erect his public monument of grati|tude, upon that national ba&s;is. Now, to con&s;ider his rea&s;oning in a ju&s;t light, it evidently amounts to this; it is the duty of the legi&s;lature of a country, to promote the national religion, what|ever it may be; in Turkey, therefore, the lawgiver &s;hould ad|vance Mahometani&s;m, in France, Spain, and Portugal, Popery; in the Briti&s;h Empire, Prote&s;tant Epi&s;copacy, in China, Idolatry: All which in their &s;everal places are calculated to promote the honour of God; becau&s;e, in the national opinion, they mu&s;t re|&s;pectively be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t adapted to that purpo&s;e. This is cer|tainly mo&s;t excellent doctrine, from the pen of a church of Eng|land divine, and a Doctor too.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="010857_0122_0F851EEA1E39F9E0">
But upon this plan of rea&s;oning, let us &s;ee what becomes of pri|mitive epi&s;copacy. If the "national religion has a right on this, or any other occa&s;ion, to the peculiar attention and con&s;ideration" of tho&s;e in power, &s;o far as to ju&s;tify the introduction of that na|tional religion, or in other words epi&s;copacy into America, how does it &s;ollow, that primitive bi&s;hops ought to be introduced? Are the Engli&s;h prelates &s;uch primitive bi&s;hops as the Doctor re|quires? Or rather did the world ever know a bi&s;hop who&s;e powers were con&s;ined, purely to ordination, the government of the cler|gy and confirmation? Surely not. Such a harmle&s;s creature, however, cannot be found in the Engli&s;h hierarchy. If, there|fore, the argument drawn from the national opinion, and the na|tional religion, has any weight, it ought to command the peculi|ar attention and con&s;ideration of our &s;uperiors, in the erection of a Babel, exactly upon the plan of an Engli&s;h hierarchy; becau&s;e, according to the Doctor's mode of rea&s;oning, it is be&s;t adapted to the national opinion. But if it is the duty of our &s;uperiors, thus to e&s;tabli&s;h the national religion in America, it is, of cour&s;e, a part of the &s;ame duty, to enforce it by the &s;ame means, by pains and penalties. For, in truth, every e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, if &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments are in them&s;elves ju&s;tifiable, ought to be main|tained, as well as tho&s;e which are merely of a civil nature, by the infliction of temporal puni&s;hments on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the law. Nor, indeed, can its efficacy, as in e&s;tabli&s;hment, con&s;i&s;t in any thing el&s;e. Hence therefore it is as evident, in the Doctor's judgment, or at lea&s;t by nece&s;&s;ary deduction from it, as the &s;un at noon tide, that we cannot make &s;uitable returns to the great author of all our benefits, but by e&s;tabli&s;hing Engli&s;h epi&s;copacy in America, and enforcing it, (for it otherwi&s;e cannot be an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment) by pains and penalties. Nay, if from principles of gratitude, the national religion, by which he means the church of England, may, as he &s;uppo&s;es, "claim a right to the peculi|ar attention, and con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are entru&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with the direction of our public affairs." What rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign|ed, why the whole Anglican hierarchy, with all its pomp and &s;plendor, with all its pride, its riches, its dominion, its tyranny, &s;hould not be e&s;tabli&s;hed over our heads? If the national re|ligion means the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment in South-Britain, which upon the Doctor's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of rea&s;oning, mu&s;t be allowed to be the be&s;t in the world: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y &s;hould we have a primitive bi&s;hop only, or rather, why a bi&s;hop reduced even to a more humble &s;tate, than that of primitive bi&s;hops, a bi&s;hop, who&s;e power &s;hould be wholly confined to ordination, government of the clergy, and the act of confirmation? Why &s;hould we not have &s;piritual courts, with all their terrible appendages? Why be &s;ecured again&s;t the dreadful con&s;equences of excommunication, both greater and le&s;|&s;er?
<PB N="244" REF="010857_0123_0F851EEAE41F2970">Why exempted from an inforced ob&s;ervation of all the holy days of the church? Why admitted to the exerci&s;e of any office in the &s;tate, till we have taken the &s;acramental te&s;t, in the only true, pure, catholic, and apo&s;tolic church? The&s;e are the en|gines e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in England, for enforcing obedience to mother church, the religion of which, the Doctor calls the nati|onal religion, and the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, the native religion of our ance&s;tors. In &s;hort it requires a very &s;lender capacity to di&s;|cern, that the principles upon whith the Doctor builds his claim, to the peculiar attention of "tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with the direction of our public a&s;&s;airs," in &s;avour of the national religion, lead directly and hece&s;&s;arily, to the full and complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>This concatenation could not have e&s;caped his &s;agacious eye. For if the national religion of South-Britain is the be&s;t and pure&s;t religion, if in the church of England, the prai&s;es and adoration of God's creatures are mo&s;t regularly offered in their &s;olemn offi|ces, which he more than in&s;inuates, why &s;hould our gratitude to the Almighty be re&s;trained? Why, rather, &s;hould the national religion be formally excluded by e&s;tabli&s;hing an epi&s;copate, as little &s;imilar to the hierarchy of the Anglican church, as it would be to primitive epi&s;copacy? He cannot think &s;o incon&s;i&s;tently; he cannot be thus at odds with him&s;elf; and while he believes, that our duty to God, requires "a peculiar attention to, and con|&s;ideration for our national religion; it at the &s;ame time mu&s;t be his opinion," and I dare &s;ay it is his ardent wi&s;h, as an hone&s;t &s;on of the church, that the &s;plendid hierarchy may be erected, and her proud banner be di&s;played over the land; over that land, to which his own ance&s;tors fled &s;or refuge, from the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit and prelatic intolerance of epi&s;copacy; that &s;pecies of epi&s;|pacy, who&s;e pre&s;ent mildne&s;s if &s;he breathes more gently on tho&s;e, who are without her bo&s;om, than &s;he formerly did, is perhaps not &s;o much to be accounted for, by the a&s;&s;ertion, "that cruelty and &s;everity is by no means the character of Engli&s;h bi&s;hops;" as to the avowed, the &s;leady and powerful protection, which his pre|&s;ent maje&s;ty, and his augu&s;t ance&s;tors, of the hou&s;e of Hanover, have always afforded to religious liberty. It cannot, indeed be doubted, that the Doctor, however con&s;i&s;tently he thinks, has not &s;tamped his writings with the &s;ame character. Nor could this be avoided. His appeal is an addre&s;s, not only to the public, but to tho&s;e in authority. To conciliate the favour of the former, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trip the bi&s;hop of all his <HI>pontificialibus,</HI> and to reduce him almo&s;t to the abject &s;tate of a mendicant fryar; but to command the attention of the latter; &s;uch &s;entiments, in favour of the national epi&s;copate, were to be di&s;covered to them, how|ever concealed from vulgar ob&s;ervation, as are calculated to &s;hew,
<PB N="245" REF="010857_0123_0F851EEAE41F2970">that through the want of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, men in power are de|prived of the principal &s;tate engine, for &s;ubduing American liber|ty. Har&s;h as the&s;e reflections may &s;eem, they are fully ju&s;tified by the pa&s;&s;age more immediately under con&s;ideration, and by many others, which I &s;hall occa&s;ionally take the liberty of di&s;&s;ecting in the view of the public.&mdash;They afford the cleare&s;t demon&s;tration, that the Doctor's po&s;itive and expre&s;s declarations, in favour of primitive epi&s;copacy, are thrown out meerly <HI>ad captandum vulgus,</HI> to amu&s;e the people; while the more &s;ecret de&s;ign of the Appeal, is to lay a &s;ure foundation for prelatic dominion in the church, and arbitrary rule in the &s;tate.&mdash;The&s;e have ever been in&s;e|perable companions; and while we are marking the one with a jealous eye, we &s;hould as attentively watch the motions of the other.</P>
<P>But before I conclude, it may not be ami&s;s to enquire into the propriety of that expre&s;&s;ion, upon which &s;o much is built, and by the magic force of which, we are taught, that whoever is op|po&s;ed, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;copacy in the colonies, is un|mindful of tho&s;e &s;ignal deliverances, which have lately been wrought for us, by the finger of God. To talk of a national religion of France, in Spain, or in Turkey, would be to &s;peak with propriety; but to apply this character to any church, in the Briti&s;h Empire, is ab&s;urd. In England prelacy is e&s;tabli&s;hed; in Scotland pre&s;byteriani&s;m; in New-England colonies congregati|onali&s;m; and in almo&s;t all the other colonies, they have no religi|ous e&s;tabli&s;hment at all.&mdash;How then, when by religion is meant, not Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, but a particular denomination of Chri&s;ti|ans; how, I &s;ay, can any religion in the king's realm or domi|nions be called national? Truly I cannot conceive now, unle&s;s by a well known figure in rhetorick, which puts the part for the whole; but upon a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance, and in an Ap|peal to the public, it is excu&s;able to deal in figures. I am there|fore rather of opinion, that the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es that England, though a part only of the great whole, has exclu&s;ively con&s;idered a right, in the plain and common &s;en&s;e of the words, as they are u&s;ed and under&s;tood by Briti&s;h Prote&s;tants, to extend her eccle&s;i|a&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment throughout the colonies of the Briti&s;h Em|pire; and to load Americans with burdens, which neither they, nor their forefathers could bear. And whether the &s;ound of this doctrine is more agreeable to an American ear, than the unmu&s;i|cal periods of the &s;tamp-act, I leave to my American readers to determine.</P>

Why, the church and clergy. He was a yelping hound that's certain.

How far the church of England or her clergy are pe|culiarly concerned in the premi&s;es, &s;o as to fancy them&s;elves only per&s;ecuted, I leave others to judge; but for my part, I can't conceive, how, in yelping and barking at &s;uch things as the&s;e, he &s;hould have followed the example of any hireling, republican, de|i&s;tical dog living, much le&s;s of the la&s;t century.

<P>In Par. 2d, and 8th, Mr. What d'ye-call-him, talks of the pre|&s;ent religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. <HI>Quere,</HI> Was not <HI>Religious</HI> put by mi&s;take in&s;tead of the word <HI>civil?</HI> Or if not, do all the laws of God as well as man, entitle any church to the full benefit of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which (in&s;tead of Chri&s;t) makes a mortal the head of the church, and is not by a &s;ingle law of God authori&s;ed?

<P>Par. 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th, being much of a piece, I &s;hall tru&s;s them all up together.

This advocate for a church, by epi&s;copalian bigots uni|ver&s;ally ab&s;olved of ignorance, pride, hypocri&s;y, and &s;uper&s;tition,

<P>This &s;kilful gardiner employed by Squire Tickle, to cultivate the plants &s;prung from the &s;eeds of di&s;cord, &s;ow'd, (as he pretends) by the pre&s;byterian or independent faction, (whether he means one or both, I know not) complements the other denominations, (for others it &s;eems there are) with living peaceably under the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment. Compliments are often ill-de&s;erved; this I fancy is &s;uch: though &s;omewhat more &s;ilent than Balaam's a&s;s, no other denomination, I dare &s;ay, lives very quietly or peacea|bly under the only religious e&s;tabli&s;hment I know of here, i. e. the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a tax, for the &s;upport of the epi&s;copal church and clergy. This is a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ay you? Why that's true; however it matters not, for civil and religious, it &s;eems are the &s;ame.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, June 23. <HI>The</HI> CENTINEL. No. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various extraordinary arguments, which Dr. Chandler makes u&s;e of to promote his favourite &s;cheme of an Amercian epi&s;copate, there is none he &s;eems to lay more &s;tre&s;s on, than that which he draws from the great increa&s;e, and large proportion in numbers of the profe&s;&s;ors of the CHURCH among the coloni&s;ts. This he carefully &s;tates: This he in&s;i&s;ts on again and again, in his appeal. Having acknowledged, that <Q>for|merly bi&s;hops were not greatly wanted, even in the provinces &s;ettled chiefly by epi&s;copalians, as the beginnings were &s;mall; and that it would have been, without di&s;pute, improper to have &s;ent them to provinces &s;ettled by people aver&s;e to epi&s;co|pal government,</Q> it lay upon him to &s;hew &s;uch a change of circum&s;tances in America, as would make it rea&s;onable to "&s;ettle" a general epi&s;copate there; for altho it is manife&s;t the numbers of people in the Briti&s;h plantations are greatly increa&s;ed, yet "our &s;uperiors" in England, might not be appri&s;ed, that in the non-conformi&s;t colonies, the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England are, at length, become &s;o re&s;pectable in point of numbers, as to make it rea&s;onable to extend the long-projected e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;copacy even to tho&s;e parts, where formerly "it would have been, without di&s;pute imporper" to have done it.</P>
<P>An argument, on which &s;o much dependence is placed, de|&s;erves to be well examined; and the rather, as we have &s;een that the doctor full of zeal for holy church, is apt to pre&s;s matters too far, and to forget mentioning all the circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to enable his readers to form a right judgment of what he offers to con&s;ideration. Thus in calculating the number of petitioners for e&s;tabli&s;hing an epi&s;copate in the colonies, he takes in the people of the &s;ugar i&s;lands, and &s;outhern colonies, altho' never con&s;ulted in the forming or forwarding the &s;even potitions, drawn up by the mi&s;&s;ionaries of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey; becau&s;e members of his church abound in tho&s;e parts, and every epi&s;copalian, as a true &s;on of the church, mu&s;t, in the doctor's judgment, be at lea&s;t a virtual &s;upplicant on this important occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This method of exaggerating facts, being the doctor's foible, it &s;hall be my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider this argument drawn from the increa&s;ed numbers of his church, and the u&s;e he makes of it.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, page 56, "a general &s;urvey was made in 1762, of the proper Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in America, and communicated by a gen|tleman
<PB N="250" REF="010857_0126_0F851EEDE6EF21F0">of veracity; that it was then found, (exclu&s;ive of the new colonies ceded by the la&s;t general treaty of the peace) they amount|ed to between two and three millions in the colonies and i&s;lands. Of the whites, the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England, were about a third part.&mdash;The pre&s;byterians, independents, and anabapti&s;ts not &s;o many.&mdash;The Germans, papi&s;ts and other denominations amounted to more." He adds, "the blacks in our i&s;lands and colonies were found, in the above mentioned &s;urvey, to be 844, 000; that many of the&s;e it is to be feared, are not Chri&s;tians at all; yet, they may be &s;aid in an imperfect &s;en&s;e to belong to the reli|gious cla&s;s of their owners, who are chiefly churchmen." Ju&s;t before, he has the&s;e words; "&s;hould it be &s;aid, that the church of England in America, contains now a million of members, the affertion might be ju&s;tified. It is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the num|bers exactly in a country &s;o widely extended, and unequally peo|pled; but from general calculations, it has been frequently &s;aid of late years, that the proper &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown in America, amount to three millions." El&s;ewhere (page 89) we are told, "that of the inhabitants of this country, a full third belong to the CHURCH; and a con&s;iderable proportion of others, are profe&s;&s;ed epi&s;copalians, who cannot con&s;i&s;tently be &s;uppo&s;ed to have an aver&s;ion to bi&s;hops." And in page 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he &s;peaks of the complaints of near a million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;uffering un|precedented hard&s;hips and intolerable grievances, for want of bi&s;hops; argues, that it is ab&s;urd, injurious and ungrateful, to entertain any &s;u&s;picion, that the admini&s;tration and legi&s;lature will treat &s;o large a number of &s;ubjects, with &s;uch cruel partiality as to deny their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the amount of what doctor Chandler has advanced on this &s;ubject. Let us now examine what it amounts to. It may not be material to di&s;pute the general number of people, here &s;aid to be, in the Briti&s;h plantations, nor the particular account of the negroes included in it; even tho' there might be &s;ome in|accuracies in the &s;urvey refer'd to. But it is of importance to a&s;k, why all the American colonies, except Canada and the Flo|ridas, are here con&s;idered in one view, and brought into one cal|culation. Why countries, &s;o disjointed and &s;o remote from each other, as many of them are, &s;hould for the purpo&s;es of &s;piritual polity, be treated as capable of a convenient connection under bi&s;hops? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperior placed at New-York, or el&s;ewhere on the continent, could be of any more &s;ervice to the i&s;lands, than his grace of London now is? Or, &s;uppo&s;e two of the&s;e lords &s;piritual placed on the continent, and one in the i&s;lands, at Jamaica for in&s;tance, as the large&s;t, (for three bi&s;hops are the mo&s;t, &s;ays their apologi&s;t, that have been
<PB N="251" REF="010857_0126_0F851EEDE6EF21F0">mentioned,) he mu&s;t have a &s;tronge eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. C. talks of the American bi&s;hop, having the inferior clergy <HI>"under his eye."</HI> Page 35.</NOTE> to &s;ee how the clergy behave at Barbados, and the other i&s;lands, which are at the di&s;|tance of five or &s;ix weeks &s;ailing from Jamaica; yet the&s;e places, and people, di&s;tant and different from each other, in climate, cu&s;toms, circum&s;tances and religious &s;entiment, are all propo&s;ed to be included in one plan of church di&s;cipline, and that too a newly projected one.</P>
<P>I wonder this zealous advocate for the propo&s;ed American hierarchy, when he was thus &s;triding over &s;ea and land, did not &s;tretch a little further than the i&s;land colonies, in order to bring &s;ome other country, (Ireland for in&s;tance) abounding with epi&s;co|palians into the &s;urvey, in order to counter-balance the great body of non-conformi&s;ts in North-America; who&s;e numbers &s;tand &s;o unluckily in the way of this grand &s;cheme of the mi&s;&s;ionaries. By this means, they might have been alle to &s;ay, that the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of epi&s;copacy, in the dependencies of Great Britain, are a great majority of all the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries, and therefore epi&s;copacy ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the middle and ea&s;tern colonies in North-America. Ireland is as much a depen|dent &s;tate as Jamaica, and as much connected with North-Ame|rica. It is true, the major part of the people in that kingdom, are papi&s;ts; but as they are "profe&s;&s;ed epi&s;copalians" and full as good churchmen, as great part of the Dr's million, <Q>they cannot con&s;i&s;tently be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any aver&s;ion to bi&s;hops.</Q> In like manner it might be contended, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland; for the profe&s;&s;ors of the CHURCH, are at lea&s;t, three parts in in four of the people of Great-Britain, taken into one account; Scotland containing lit|tle more than a million of people of all denominations; and the di&s;&s;enters in England not exceeding a million, among &s;even or eight, which that part of the united kingdom is &s;aid to contain. Their union in legi&s;lation, and their adjacency, would be additi|onal arguments, not &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the ca&s;e of the colonies.</P>
<P>The white people in the i&s;lands, &s;ome few quakers, papi&s;ts and jews excepted, are all profe&s;&s;ors of epi&s;copacy as e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. It has not yet appeared that they &s;uffer per&s;ecution, nor have we heard them cry out for relief, on account of "unprece|dented had&s;hips and intolerable grievances." If they want an epi&s;copate in every i&s;land, and will provide for the &s;upport, and regulate the authority of &s;uch an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperior, by act of a&s;&s;embly, the way &s;eems to be clear for them; and till the crown refu&s;es to concur, there is no ground for complaint. As they have not offered to do this, we mu&s;t take it for granted, they are
<PB N="252" REF="010857_0127_0F851EEEED11A4B8">content with the &s;uperitendency of the bi&s;hop of London, and do not wi&s;h for a bi&s;hop any nearer. The &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;aid of Virginia, Maryland and other &s;outhern provinces, where the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the doctor's church have the upper hand; notwith|&s;tanding di&s;&s;enters are numerous in tho&s;e parts and increa&s;e daily. That power, which e&s;tabli&s;hed pari&s;hes and taxes for the epi&s;copal clergy, mu&s;t be able to guard the CHURCH again&s;t all per&s;ecution, and to give it dignitaries re&s;iding in America, as &s;oon as the re|&s;pective legi&s;latures, who are the be&s;t judges, find them nece&s;&s;ary. How is it po&s;&s;ible then, that near a million of people "in Ame|rica, are "&s;uffering for their religious principles and denied the &s;ame privileges, as all other denominations enjoy?" Is it inge|nuous, is it con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a mini&s;ter of the "true religion" to repre&s;ent the epi&s;copal churches of America in general, as in di&s;tre&s;s and under per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>Tho' the people of the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, and of the epi&s;copal colonies have been lugged into this bu&s;ne&s;s, yet we find, they have nothing to do with it. They have neither been petitioners with the Dr. and his brethren, for bi&s;hops; nor are they di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted. As the mi&s;&s;ionaries are the &s;ole petitioners, &s;o are they and their followers the only people who can have any cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>But even as to them, the charge is mo&s;t unju&s;t and ungrateful; Unju&s;t to their neighbours, and the civil governments under which they live; Ungrateful to their &s;uperiors and fellow &s;ubjects in England. They are here called on to &s;hew any in&s;tance, wherein they are denied equal privileges with others. In three of the New-England governments, where a very lax kind of re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hment has obtained, the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters are en|tuled to that part of the tax levied for &s;upporting the clergy, which ari&s;es from their own church members. In the city of New-York, and in &s;ome of the counties of that colony, part of the poor tax is taken to maintain their mini&s;ters. In Rhode-I&s;land, New-Jer&s;ey, and Penn&s;ylvania, they are on a footing with the mo&s;t favoured. And in all the old colonies, north-ea&s;t of Mary|land, they have mini&s;ters called mi&s;&s;ionaries, (a name peculiar to &s;uch as are &s;ent to in&s;truct infidels) &s;upported for them by the charity of well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons in England and Ireland, and in the reformed churches of Holland, Germany, and Switzerland; at an expence of between three and four thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, per annum.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome of the&s;e pretended mi&s;&s;ionaries, and the&s;e only, who have rai&s;ed all the late clamours for bi&s;hops; who are re&s;t|le&s;s and unwearied in their endeavours to procure an e&s;tabli&s;hment over the body of the people, among whom they re&s;ide. So un|rea&s;onable are they, that not contented with being the mo&s;t fa|voured,
<PB N="253" REF="010857_0127_0F851EEEED11A4B8">they would have their di&s;cipline extended over all other denominations, by act of parliament; tho' their church be not a fortieth part of the community. The &s;tate of epi&s;copacy in the old colonies north ea&s;t of Maryland, is nearly this. The&s;e di&s;tricts having at fir&s;t &s;ettled by people of non-conformi&s;t opinions, chiefly refugees from the per&s;ecutions of the Bi&s;hops in England, the &s;ew profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England, who &s;ettled among them from time to time, would have almo&s;t generally joined with, and been un|di&s;tingui&s;hed at this day from the other prote&s;tant communions, had it not been for the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, or rather for propagating epi&s;copacy. To their <Q>indefatigable application and amazing per&s;everance,</Q> we will readily allow, it is owing, that there are above five or &s;ix &s;uch congregations in all the coun|try above particularized. What indeed are their &s;ocieties, for the mo&s;t part, but little parties, not deferving the name of congrega|tions, utterly unable to &s;upport their preachers? At this day, there is no city, town, or place, throughout the middle and ea&s;|tern colonies, except Philadelphia, where the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England &s;upport their clergy, without help; whil&s;t other denominations, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, maintain their pa&s;tors, to the number of eight or nine hundred; except it may be the papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itive and accurate Dr. Stiles, of Rhode-I&s;land, in his di&s;cour&s;e on Chri&s;tian Union, tells us, he found the epi&s;copa|lians, in all New-England, did not exceed 12,600 &s;ouls; yet they had 30 mini&s;ters, and 47 places of wor&s;hip. This was in 1760. The people of other denominations appeared to be 487, 000; and they maintained above 600 pa&s;tors, exclu&s;ive of the public in&s;truc|tors among the Friends. The ea&s;e is much the &s;ame in Penn&s;ylva|nia. The Rev. Mr. Craig, of Che&s;ter, who has re&s;ided a long time, and in different parts of the province, in his letter to the &s;ociety in 1764, &s;ays, "that of the people of the province, who as &s;ome calculate are 300, 000 &s;ouls, he can &s;afely affirm not one fiftieth part, belong to the church of England; and that his communi|cants in his three congregations, were 15 only. The Rev. Mr. Thomp&s;on, itinerant mi&s;&s;ionary in the counties of York and Cum|berland, acquainted his venerable patrons the &s;ame year, that his people within tho&s;e counties, did not exceed 202 &s;ouls; altho' it is well known tho&s;e di&s;tricts contained at that time, thirty or forty thou&s;and inhabitants. And the Rev. Mr. Murray of Berks county, complained that his people at Mollattin, were reduced by removals, to twenty-nine families; that he de&s;paired of &s;eeing a church built within his mi&s;&s;ion; and expected &s;oon to be re|duced to the &s;ociety's allowance for his &s;upport<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Society's ab&s;tract for <HI>1765,</HI> for the&s;e and many other accounts of a &s;imilar nature.</NOTE> The epi&s;copal
<PB N="254" REF="010857_0128_0F851EEF9DE175B8">&s;ocieties in New-York and New-Jer&s;ey are in very little better cir|cum&s;tances. At Cohanzie, in We&s;t-Jer&s;ey, &s;tands a church, but there is not the &s;hadow of a congregation in the county. At Sa|lem the epi&s;copal cau&s;e is almo&s;t as low. It would be tedious, as it is needle&s;s, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ply in&s;tances to illu&s;trate this matter: Suf|fice it to &s;ay, that it is in the cities and &s;ome of the larger towns only, that their congregations are numerous. Yet the epi&s;copal church in the non-epi&s;copal colonies, never was in &s;uch outwardly flouri&s;hing circum&s;tance: And no wonder; the &s;ociety's expen|&s;ive interpo&s;ition, could not but have &s;ome con&s;iderable effects. It has brought it from nothing to &s;omething; it has kept the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England together; and, as many like cheapne&s;s, even in the way to heaven, &s;ome have joined them from other churches, who were well enough plea&s;ed to have mi|ni&s;ters maintained for them, by good-natured people in England, and el&s;ewhere. How unju&s;t, how ungrateful then, are the&s;e mi&s;|&s;ionaries of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey in their complaints of hard&s;hip, grievances and per&s;ecution. They are unju&s;t to their fellow &s;ubjects, among whom they re&s;ide: Ungrateful to their patrons and benefactors in Europe: and their behaviour mu&s;t re|flect &s;everely on their own characters, wherever this unfairne&s;s and di&s;ingenuity &s;hall be opened up.</P>
<P>But the artifice of bringing all the old colonies and i&s;lands into one view and computation, is not the only or chief ground of complaint again&s;t Doctor Chandler, in his management of this argument. It is indeed but a &s;mall in&s;tance of his infirmity, compared to one I &s;hall now mention.</P>
<P>No one will a&s;&s;ert, that the whites of the Doctor's church in America, amount to "a million nearly." We may very &s;afely &s;ay, they are not half that number. In all our i&s;lands, the white people do not come up to 90.000; and on the continent, the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the church of England cannot be four times as nume|rous. Where then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Dr. get above 500, 000 of his church|men? Only among the Negroes, tho&s;e virtual epi&s;copalians, who chiefly belong to epi&s;copal owners. An attentive reader will ea|&s;ily perceive this, altho' the Dr. &s;eems loth to &s;peak it out plainly. Behold a crowd of Negroes, in the I&s;lands, and &s;outhern colonies, almo&s;t all of whom "are not Chri&s;tians at all" &s;lipt into the epi&s;copal &s;cale, in order to balance, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the dead weight of non-conformi&s;ts in the northern colonies; and yet it kicks the beam! Behold at lea&s;t 500, 000 virtual churchmen, vir|tually petitioning by their friends the clergy of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey for bi&s;hops! What low artifice is this! How unbe|coming the clerical character! Well may dei&s;ts repre&s;ent di&s;&s;imu|lation, as a vice of the order: Such behaviour, but too well ju&s;ti|fies the charge.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="010857_0128_0F851EEF9DE175B8">
Are bi&s;hops then to be introduced into, and impo&s;ed on the non-epi&s;copal colonies, which were granted as a&s;ylums from the power of proud prelates, by the force of &s;uch wretched arguments, as this we have been con&s;idering? It mu&s;t not, it cannot be: <Q>It is ab&s;urd, injurious and ungrateful to entertain any &s;u&s;picion, that the admini&s;tration and legi&s;lature will treat &s;o large a Number of good &s;ubjects with &s;uch cruel partiality</Q> as to put them <Q>under a yoke, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear,</Q> merely to exalt a little party, &s;ome of who&s;e clergy, affect importance, and make a great bu&s;tle, proudly ar|rogating to them&s;elves the name of Church, as if all Chri&s;tianity was confined within their narrow pale. It may be time enough a great while hence, to think of "&s;ettling" epi&s;copacy (the Doc|tor u&s;es this as a &s;ofter term than e&s;tabli&s;h) in the&s;e colonies, if numbers are to determine the point. It would be fair, however, that the epi&s;copal colonies, &s;hould try the experiment of import|ing bi&s;hops fir&s;t; at lea&s;t, whil&s;t they neglect providing for ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiors, the rejectors of epi&s;copacy may be well ex|cu&s;ed in oppo&s;ing their e&s;tabli&s;hment among them, by an act of the &s;tate.</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for hypocri&s;y long to remain undetected, when &s;he expo&s;es her actions to public attention, "in the fair face of day." Pa&s;&s;ion and ungoverned zeal, will inevitably put her by her guard, her ma&s;k will fall off in the hurry of intere&s;t, and di&s;|cover the mon&s;ter in her native hideou&s;ne&s;s. This has been the ca&s;e with the bitter faction, which now is, and always has been endeavouring, to fix the vile&s;t &s;tains on the reputation of the church. In &s;pite of all their former di&s;gui&s;es, they now &s;tand confe&s;s'd the real &s;oawn of that invenom'd brood, who bur&s;t the bonds of gratitude, ju&s;tice, and religion, and in a torrent over|turn'd
<PB N="256" REF="010857_0129_0F851EF01FF64BF8">turn'd altars, levell'd, churches, and laid wa&s;te "principalities and powers." Any per&s;on acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, mu&s;t be &s;truck with the re&s;emblance there is vi&s;ible, even in the &s;oam they have ca&s;t forth. There is hardly a paper of the whig, "that whineth not of bloody per&s;ecutions, "the Power of a bi&s;hop's pa&s;toral &s;taff," "the &s;carlet whore." <Q>mitred ge|nerali&s;&s;imo,</Q> "cup of fornication," <Q>grandeur of St. Paul's church,</Q> "Popi&s;h apparel, prelacy," "onions of Egypt," and other like cant phra&s;es, tun'd formerly from the no&s;es of tho&s;e Puritanical &s;nufflers, who overwhelm'd the nation with bloody de&s;truction. But what &s;urpri&s;es me mo&s;t is, that the&s;e dabblers in politics &s;hould in&s;inuate, that "* the national church of Eng|land," was compos'd almo&s;t wholly of men who embrac'd pro|te&s;tanti&s;m merely to &s;ave their e&s;tates, and avoid per&s;ecu|tion." &mdash;Let hi&s;tory indubitably prove the fal&s;hood and illi|berality of this a&s;&s;ertion! In the times of &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecution, were not the clergy of the church mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their oppo&s;ition to popery, as well in their writings as actions? Did not &s;ome of her mo&s;t dignify'd eccle&s;ia&s;tics fall victims to the cruelty of papi&s;ts?

<P>And &s;ince the Roman &s;tate&s;men have long de&s;pair'd by force and military violence to recover the&s;e kingdoms under the do|minion of the holy &s;ee, they betake them&s;elves to &s;tratagem, and artfully attempt to &s;ubvert that reformation by divi&s;ions, which they were unable to over-throw by a more open a&s;&s;ault; it be|ing a maxim in the conclave, that there is no other way to pre|vent people from turning hereticks, and for the recovery of o|thers again to the mother church, than by a diver&s;ity of doc|trines.</P>

<P>To give the clearer light to the&s;e di&s;coveries, let us look back a few ages ago, and we &s;hall find a very remarkable hi&s;tory in the reign of queen Elizabeth, of one Faithful Commin, a Roman divine, who came over into England, and was generally reputed as a very zealous prote&s;tant; his &s;eeming piety procur'd him a very great character with the inferior people, who were more particularly plea&s;ed with him for his &s;evere raillery again&s;t the church of Rome, and his bitter invectives again&s;t the pope him|&s;elf: This impo&s;ter was at la&s;t detected, but by an e&s;cape avoid|ed the hands of ju&s;tice, and returned to Rome. The pope im|mediately impri&s;oned him for the abu&s;es he had &s;pread about him in England; but Commin writ to his holine&s;s, and acquainted him that he had &s;omething of importance to communicate to him, if he could have the honour to be admitted into his pre&s;ence; the pope &s;ent for him next day, and as &s;oon as he &s;aw him, &s;ir, &s;aid he, I have heard the character you have be&s;tow'd upon me and my predece&s;&s;ors, among your hereticks in England, by re|viling my per&s;on and expo&s;ing my church; Commin reply'd, I confe&s;s my lips have utter'd what my heart never thought; but your holine&s;s little imagines the con&s;iderable &s;ervices I have done you: To which the pope return'd, how, in the name of Je&s;us, Mary, and all the &s;aints, ha&s;t thou done &s;o? &s;ir, &s;aid Commin, I preached again&s;t &s;et forms of prayer, and I called the Engli&s;h liturgy a tran&s;lation of the ma&s;s book; I have made the people fond of extempore prayer, and by that means the church of England, is become as odious to my pro&s;elytes, as ma&s;s is to the church of England, and this will be a &s;tumbling-block to that church while it is a church: Upon which the pope commended him, and gave him a reward of two thou&s;and ducats for his good &s;ervice.</P>
<P>To give the greater evidence to what I have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall, for the benefit of the Engli&s;h reader, tran&s;late a copy of that publick in&s;trument, a Je&s;uit receives from the pope, when he is &s;ent as an emi&s;&s;ary to advance the intere&s;t of Rome, in any of the reformed churches.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS we (the pope) have found and daily find here&s;ies increa&s;ing in &s;everal colonies, principalities, realms and countries, &s;ubject to the &s;acred &s;ee of St. Peter our predece&s;&s;or, and they de&s;erting our juri&s;diction with

Coolne&s;s and mildne&s;s ought to be pre&s;erved in every controver&s;y, but e&s;pecially, where an opponent makes u&s;e of the greate&s;t moderation and tender|ne&s;s. &mdash;A contrary conduct &s;erves but to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, and confu&s;es the &s;ubject in the noi&s;e of contention. Indeed from the con&s;tant tenor of your paper, this &s;eems to have been your primary intention, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, &s;uch a purpo&s;e has been ad|mirably an&s;wered;&mdash;for the &s;parks of re&s;entment, which were before dying away, are kindled into a blaze, and will &s;oon (I fear) rage with the greate&s;t violence.&mdash;Your fir&s;t paper, &s;wel|ling with ill-nature, was all over beautified with &s;uch innocent puerilities, as were extremely diverting, but unfortunately, tho&s;e bubbles of wit (you are fond of playing with) are &s;o thin and light&s;ome, that they &s;hrink at the touch, and if blown upon by the lea&s;t breath of inquiry, bur&s;t into nothing.&mdash;'Tis true you promi&s;e us pretty largely in that paper, "that you would &s;hew as well the falfity of the facts, as the futility of the rea&s;on|ing

By trumpetting out your own prai&s;es; or by throwing out the mo&s;t uncharitable in&s;inuations again&s;t the church and its clergy?&mdash;Your &s;pending the time of the pub|lic, with long aggravated details of the evils of &s;piritual courts, or with weak, though imbittered attacks at epi&s;copacy, is, I conceive, nothing to the purpo&s;e;&mdash;for the fir&s;t is what the church does not appeal for; and as for the &s;econd, if the church imagines it nece&s;&s;ary or beneficial to it&s;elf, your contrariety of opinion will not be of much con&s;equence, &s;ince every denomina|tion of Chri&s;tians, in his maje&s;ty's dominions, is allowed the free enjoyment of its religious opinions and privileges.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ubject in debate, I appeal to every unpre|judiced per&s;on, whether one ray of light has been ca&s;t on it; or whether the mi&s;ts of prejudice, re&s;entment and calumny, have not been rai&s;ed to the almo&s;t utter extinction of friend&s;hip, love, and concord among our fellow citizens.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;olely guided by the meteor of rage and prejudice, or no public writer could have wandered &s;o far from the path he propo&s;ed to tread.</P>
<P>As an an&s;wer to the appeal, the public has been entertained with a Wel&s;h letter of kowz, and zowz, and goozy chickz.

<P>The identity of po&s;&s;ible and probable; or a new &s;y&s;tem of ratio|cination, by a convention of &s;piritual logicians, at one of their anniver&s;ary meetings for the propagation of&mdash;a conve|nient &s;ettlement for the bi&s;hop of LANDAFF, in a country where people do not expect to peri&s;h for lack of that kind of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHATEVER opinion the world may form of Dr. Chand|ler's candour, or his talents for rea&s;oning, I think no author that has ever appeared, can di&s;pute with him the prize of artifice and &s;ophi&s;try. In art, he &s;urpa&s;&s;es the mo&s;t art|ful; and the mo&s;t &s;ophi&s;tical in his dexterity at &s;ophi&s;ms. In &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, numerous in&s;tances might, and hereaf|ter &s;hall be produced from the memorable appeal. I &s;hall at pre&s;ent confine my&s;elf to the 109th page, which is a ma&s;|ter-piece of the noble &s;cience of logical craft; and may be of &s;ingular u&s;e, in teaching future rea&s;oners to refute any objecti|on in the world, by a bare &s;ub&s;titution of a different word in the an&s;wer, for that contained in the objection. The whole pa&s;&s;age runs thus; <Q>another objection has been made by &s;ome per&s;ons, to the following purport, that if Bi&s;hops are once &s;ettled in America, although in the manner we now propo&s;e, there will probably be an augmentation of their power, as &s;oon as cir|cum&s;tances will admit of it; and what is ea&s;y and inoffen&s;ive in its beginning, may become but then&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive in its end. But at this rate there can be no end of objecting. For if every po&s;&s;ible ill effect of a thing, although confe&s;&s;edly proper in it|&s;elf, and harmle&s;s in its natural tendency, may be made an argument again&s;t it, there is nothing that can e&s;cape. Argu|ments of this &s;ort may be as fairly and properly alledged&mdash; again&s;t a religious toleration, which is now generally e&s;teemed by prote&s;tants, to be a natural right of men, and a very im|portant one of Chri&s;tians&mdash;again&s;t admitting tho&s;e, who di&s;|&s;ent from the national religion, to any degree of civil or mili|tary power, to which indeed they have no natural right&mdash; again&s;t allowing the common people the u&s;e of the holy &s;crip|tunes, or the liberty of examining any points of religion or go|vernment &mdash;again&s;t &s;uffering any to receive a learned educa|tion, &amp;c. for none can tell what ill con&s;equences and abu&s;es may follow, in &s;ome future period, from the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions and indulgences. The truth is, men are not to be terrified or in|fluenced by fears of &s;uch con&s;equences as are barely po&s;&s;ible;
<PB N="263" REF="010857_0132_0F851EF7DCF03FB8">but to con&s;ider what is rea&s;onable and proper in it&s;elf, and what effects will probably and naturally follow.</Q></P>
<P>The objection here &s;tated is, that if Bi&s;hops are once &s;ettled in America, although in the manner now propo&s;ed, there will pro|bably be an augmentation of their power, as &s;oon as circum&s;tan|ces will admit of it; and what is ea&s;y and inoffen&s;ive in its be|ginning, may be burden&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive in its end. Now if there be any rea&s;on for the&s;e apprehen&s;ions; or in other words if it is really probably that &s;uch a cau&s;e will produce &s;uch effects, the objection is well founded. On the contrary, if there be no probability that an epi&s;copate &s;o harmle&s;s in its original erection, will finally degenerate into the evil apprehended, it is altogether groundle&s;s. The fir&s;t, and I think the only thought, that would therefore occur to an author, who wrote under the influence of truth and &s;incerity, would be to remove the objection, by di&s;|proving the probability on which it was was rai&s;ed. But let us &s;ee how cleverly a writer, who cannot follow rea&s;on and nature when rea&s;on and nature are again&s;t him, can depart from both. <Q>But at this rate (&s;ays he) there can be no end of objecting. For if every po&s;&s;ible ill effect of a thing, al|though confe&s;&s;edly proper in it&s;elf, and harmle&s;s in its na|tural tendency, may be made an argument again&s;t it, there is nothing that can e&s;cape.</Q> But pray is it, at this rate, that the objection is &s;tated? Nothing like it. The objecti|on is grounded on the probability of the con&s;equence, which the objector is introduced as apprehending. He is not repre&s;ented as alarmed at bare po&s;&s;ibilities, which would be idle and rediculous. But he is brought on the &s;tage as declaring his di&s;approving of the &s;cheme propo&s;ed, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that tho' it be harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive as reque&s;ted, it has a natural tendency to degene|rate, and probably will finally i&s;&s;ue in what is de&s;tructive and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">icious; and in this view, ought to be alarming, and the matter of oppo&s;ition and conte&s;t. For what purpo&s;e then is the probable! in the objection, &s;o dexterou&s;ly and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;lid into the po&s;&s;ible, in the an&s;wer? Does the doctor really think it either probable or po&s;&s;ible to convince the world, that this was done without de&s;ign, or with the hone&s;t purpo&s;e of &s;erving the cau&s;e of truth? Should a man tell our author, that he was afraid to travel a particular road, becau&s;e, from probable circum&s;tan|ces, he had rea&s;on to apprehend it was infe&s;ted with robbers; could he think of allaying the fears of the traveller by the fol|lowing an&s;wer, <Q>Sir if every po&s;&s;ible thing is made an argument, again&s;t your proceeding on your journey, there is no &s;uch thing as travelling at all.</Q> Would not the man conclude, that the doctor greatly undervalued his life and property; or treated him like a per&s;on void of under&s;tanding?&mdash;What then mu&s;t we
<PB N="264" REF="010857_0133_0F851EF88F3F2AF0">think, when an author endeavours to palm &s;uch fu&s;tian on the world; and appears before the tribunal of the public with &s;uch cobweb &s;ophi&s;try? What a &s;trange perver&s;ion of the noble facul|ty of rea&s;on, to the unworthy purpo&s;e of delu&s;ion and chicanery! A melancholy in&s;tance of the power of prejudice, and how am|bition will blind and intoxicate the under&s;tandings of men, o|therwi&s;e clear and di&s;cerning!</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of an&s;wering the objection as fir&s;t &s;tated, and in the form in which it is really &s;trong and forcible; he proceeds in rendering it &s;till more ridiculous, by a &s;udden and artful tran&s;mu|tation into what, to an incautious reader, would appear, and what he intended &s;hould appear, no more than a bare repetition of it' in a different mode of expre&s;&s;ion. 'For if every po&s;&s;ible ill 'effect of a thing, although 'confe&s;&s;edly proper in it&s;elf, and harmle&s;s in its natural tendency, &amp;c.' But is this a fair &s;tate of the objection? Is it &s;o much as a &s;uppo&s;eable ca&s;e, that the &s;ame per&s;on who confe&s;&s;es the thing harmle&s;s in its natural tendency &s;hould object again&s;t it, as tending to, produce the evils he appre|hends, and which con&s;titute the very e&s;&s;ence of the objection? The meaning of this pa&s;&s;age, if it has any meaning at all, mu&s;t therefore be this: The thing, Mr. objector, which I declare to be, and which others confe&s;s to be, proper in it&s;elf, and harmle&s;s in its natural tendency, you ought not to object again&s;t, or there is nothing that can e&s;cape. But in this &s;en&s;e, the argument is as ridiculous as he has endeavoured to make the objection. For there is nothing &s;urely ab&s;urd in one man's apprehending danger, from what another conceives pro|per and harmle&s;s. But it is the highe&s;t ab&s;urdity for the &s;ame man to object to a thing, as likely to become burden&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive, which him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es to be harmle&s;s in its natu|ral tendency. And yet &s;uch is the &s;ubtil turn which this anti|hu&s;&s;ar in controver&s;y, has given to &s;o plain and per&s;picuous an objection. But let us con&s;ider the &s;everal particulars, by which he has endeavoured to elucidate, that there is no force in the ob|jection he combats; and which as he perverts it before he enters upon an an&s;wer, was really never made. The in&s;tances by which he thought proper to illu&s;trate the incon&s;equence of the no-ob|jection he is at pre&s;ent mo&s;t pui&s;&s;antly attacking; and again&s;t which, he &s;ays, arguments of this &s;ort may be as fairly and pro|perly alledged, are the four that follow; and which, con&s;idering his violent antipathy to any alteration of his method, I &s;hall con|&s;ider in the order he has mentioned them.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <Q>Again&s;t a religious toleration, which is now generally e&s;teemed by prote&s;tants; to be the natural right of men, and a very important one of Chri&s;tians.</Q> And does this gentlemen
<PB N="265" REF="010857_0133_0F851EF88F3F2AF0">really think, that there is equal rea&s;on for apprehending pernici|ous con&s;equences from a religious toleration, which has never yet produced one &s;uch con&s;equence, as there is from the pride and ambition of dignified eccle&s;ia&s;ties, which has &s;o frequently turned whole nations top&s;y-turvy? And pray what doth he mean by the mumbling, "mincing is now generally e&s;teemed by Prote&s;tants?" Does not he him&s;elf e&s;teem a religious toleration to be the natural right of men, and a very important one of Chri&s;tians? If he does, why doth he not &s;peak out like a man? If he thinks otherwi&s;e, why afraid publickly and explicitly to avow it? But the next illu&s;tration is involved in &s;till greater ob|&s;curity: and might with much more propriety be termed an ob|fu&s;cation of the truth. For,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <Q>Arguments of this &s;ort, &s;ays he, may be as fairly and properly alledged again&s;t tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from the national religion to any degree of civil or military power, to which in-indeed they have no natural right.</Q> That is in plain Engli&s;h, it is as ridiculous to apprehend any danger from the abu&s;e of inordinate power in the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who appear from hi&s;tory to have almo&s;t perpetually abu&s;ed it, as from an admi&s;&s;ion of the Di&s;&s;enters to the common rights of all loyal &s;ubjects, which they have never abu&s;ed. A &s;triking in&s;tance this, of that moderation and candour towards Di&s;&s;enters, which, for a certain rea&s;on, I mean &s;moothly to carry his point, he was obliged to a&s;&s;ume; but which for another certain rea&s;on, I mean his mental bitterne&s;s again&s;t them, he could not conceal! But what means the Doctor by &s;aying, <Q>that the Di&s;&s;enters have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power.</Q> If by natural right, he means any right in contradi&s;tinction to municipal or political rights; it may with equal propriety be predicated of the Epi&s;co|palians, and of all men. For no man has a natural right to a political privilege: And in this &s;en&s;e, it is nothing but downright malevolence, without any tendency to benefit his argument. If he means by it any thing peculiar to Di&s;&s;enters, what prevented him from &s;hewing the &s;uperior natural rights of the conformi&s;ts? But probably it was intended by way of title, in contra&s;t to that of the members of the church of England, that we take care in all future times, not to be more cautions when &s;peaking of the latter, in adding as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, than of the former, with the di&s;tingui&s;hing addition of, "who have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power." But.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <Q>Arguments of this &s;ort, may be as fairly and pro|perly alledged again&s;t allowing the common people the u&s;e of the &s;criptures, or the liberty of examining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> point of religion or government.</Q> Arguments have actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brought (&s;uch

The holy &s;criptures were given to teach men the way to &s;alvation; and they are &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary for in&s;truction, &amp;c. But can it be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary for a bi&s;hop, to be clothed with powers formidable to the civil rights of mankind? If not; how are the in&s;tances parallel? Without the liberty of examining any points of religion, religion would &s;oon degenerate into prie&s;tcraft; as experience &s;hews it has done, whenever &s;uch liberty has been re&s;trained. Without the liberty of examining into any points of government, (a &s;ingular phra&s;e!) government would degenerate into tyranny; as all hi&s;tory &s;hew, it has done, where &s;uch examination was prohibitted. How, therefore, can that which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the very ex|i&s;tence of religion and government; and which, in&s;tead of pro|ducing, has prevented evil and oppre&s;&s;ion, be dangerous to either? Or be compared to that, which is not e&s;&s;ential to epi&s;copacy, and has frequently proved de&s;tructive and pernicious? But,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The po&s;&s;ible ill con&s;equences and abu&s;es of a learned education are placed in compari&s;on with the danger apprehend|ed from the probable augmentation of the epi&s;copal power, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit of it. The compari&s;on, truly, has no kind of &s;imilitude, and to give it a lift, the author is obliged to have recour&s;e to his wonder-working po&s;&s;ible, which has probably been of greater &s;ervice to him throughout this whole augmentative page, than ever it was to all other the pamphle|teers his predece&s;&s;ors put together. <Q>The truth is, (&s;ays he,) men are not to be terrified or influenced by fears of &s;uch con|&s;equences as are barely po&s;&s;ible; but to con&s;ider what is rea|&s;onable and proper in it&s;elf, and what effects will probably and naturally follow.</Q></P>
<P>Thus after a rotation of a page, he returns to the very &s;pot from whence he &s;tarted, and again gives the objection as it was &s;tated at fir&s;t. For it is of &s;uch effects, as will probably and na|turally follow, and of no other, that the objector is &s;uppo&s;ed to be apprehen&s;ive; and which the author has metamorpho&s;ed into &s;uch, as are barely po&s;&s;ible, and in that light endeavoured to re|move by comparing them to others, that are but barely po&s;&s;ible; and whether it is either probable or po&s;&s;ible, that all this was done without de&s;ign to rai&s;e a mi&s;t before the reader, I cheer|fully &s;ubmit to the tribunal of the public. To me it &s;eems pretty extraordinary, that of all the things in the world, the gentle|man
<PB N="267" REF="010857_0134_0F851EF93845FD98">&s;hould have &s;elected a religious toleration, the admi&s;&s;ion of Di&s;&s;enter to any degree of civil power, the reading of the holy &s;criptures, and a learned education, as the four objects of equal terror, with the additaments to the power of bi&s;hops, as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit; becau&s;e the&s;e have not the lea&s;t ten|dency to introduce any mi&s;chief, while the other as naturally tends to it, as heavy bodies do to the centre; is it becau&s;e the&s;e things appear peculiarly formidable to tho&s;e who want an Ameri|can hierachy, that they &s;o familiarly offer them&s;elves as things particularly liable to evil con&s;equences?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Squire T. (No. V.) has employ'd another deputy to Whip in his room, I beg leave to give a Kick or two in yours. This new Whipper (who calls him&s;elf Probus) &s;ays, (par. 1.2. &amp;c.) 'the Whig's de&s;ign is to divide the mem|bers of the church of England.' No doubt of it!&mdash;when a cord and a cable pull different ways, it mu&s;t &s;urely be a prudent piece of art to divide the cord, le&s;t its &s;uperior &s;trength &s;hould break the cable; and who can blame Probus for endeavouring to
<PB N="268" REF="010857_0135_0F851EFA5C6CB008">give us high ideas of the greatne&s;s of his little party, any more than a &s;chool-boy for &s;tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing on &s;tilts, or AESOP's <HI>frog</HI> for &s;triving to &s;well to the &s;ize of a CALF?</P>
<P>Par. 3d. He gives us a &s;tring of quotations from the <HI>Whig,</HI> N. III in which if the reader can fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a &s;ingle in&s;tance of alteration, decurtation, or other mi&s;repre&s;entation, I hereby oblige my&s;elf to pay <HI>Probus</HI>'s whipping-&s;ees; for nobody &s;urely will take the trouble of comparing Whig and Whip together.</P>
<P>Par. 4th. With his arms akembo, he gives him&s;elf airs as a critical hi&s;torian, (and like doctor C&mdash;r,) implicitly boa&s;ts of the character of a Tory; which if any man pre&s;umes to think di&s;repu|table or unfriendly to liberty, he is a Whig; which is, being by &s;ycopants interpreted, a lying ra&s;cal, but, by all loyal patriots and friends to the revolution, an hone&s;t man. I expected your kicks, &s;ir, would &s;tagger &s;quire T. and his a&s;&s;ociates; but Pro|bus, it &s;eems, is already much &s;tagger'd by his own thoughts! 'Twere a pity the poor fellow &s;hould break his neck before his own reformation is more complete; but if the Whig's complaint of the imperfection of the reformation in Henry VIII's. reign, &s;hould make him reel &s;o as to fall, who can help it? Probus has &s;uch a peculiar talent at making feints with his whip, that no mortal can gue&s;s beforehand where it will fall;&mdash;let us con&s;ider his merit this way. The Whig &s;ays, 'the reformation was be|gun by Henry VIII. from no very religious motive;" <HI>ergo,</HI> (Pro|bus infers) he con&s;iders Henry as a reformer,&mdash;Probus &s;ays, he is called &s;o, by none that he knows of but Papi&s;ts;" ergo, the Whig, (for he knows of him) is a Papi&s;t. [Quere, what Papi&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver complimented Henry with the title of a reformer?] The Whig in&s;inuates, "that the high and low-church parties, origi|nated from different motives at the reformation;" ergo, (&s;ays Probus) he in&s;inuates, "that the di&s;tinction originated from thence;" ergo, again, "he lies like the d&mdash;dunce Mahomet, in his Koran." "The di&s;tinction, it &s;eems, was not known for more than a century after." So we are told, the di&s;tinction of Cavaliers and Round-Heads, was not known, till the reign of that king who had his head cut off; nor that of the Whigs and and Tories, till about the year 1678, in the reign of that buck his &s;on; and yet, quere, were not Rehoboam's old prudent coun&s;ellors in reality Whigs, and his young hot headed advi&s;ers Tories? I mu&s;t, it &s;eems, inform Probus, that a thing &s;ome|times exi&s;ts long before it has a name. But to proceed, the Whig &s;ays, "&s;uch as were Papi&s;ts in their hearts, were always mighty &s;ticklers for rites and ceremonies, the uninterrupted line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &amp;c." Ergo, he &s;ays, "&s;ticklers for ceremonies, were always Papi&s;ts in their hearts." Ergo again, he calls Laud
<PB N="269" REF="010857_0135_0F851EFA5C6CB008">and Hall Papi&s;ts in their hearts. Probus &s;ays, "Bi&s;hop Hall was a favourer of puritani&s;m;" ergo, "he was one of the warme&s;t friends of Di&s;&s;enters." "He wrote a book, entitled, Epi&s;co|pacy by divine right;" ergo, "he was one of the mon&s;t &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erters of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion." (a&s;&s;erters! very well!) "No church on earth is more di&s;tingui&s;hed for moderation than that of Eng|land, and &s;he &s;hews &s;ufficient indulgence to &s;crupulous con&s;cien|ces;" ergo, "The demands of heated enthu&s;ia&s;ts, factious &s;ec|tari&s;ts, and re&s;tle&s;s heretics, are unrea&s;onable." The American Whig, &amp;c. (tho&s;e heated &s;ectari&s;ts, &amp;c.) demand &s;ecurity from epi&s;copal tyranny." (what pre&s;umption!) ergo, "If they are gratified, this moderate church will &s;oon be utterly annihilated: Alas! then for the dear, dear, dear ceremonies and canons!" "The independents in England per&s;ecuted &s;ticklers 120 years ago, and beheaded a man who had been a king," ergo, "The Whig, and his party the Pre&s;byterians, (perhaps Papi&s;ts) would fain do the &s;ame now in America. Quere, what induced Pro|bus to put heathens in&s;tead of &s;ticklers, &amp;c? An&s;wer Intere&s;t. Vid. par. 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th.</P>
<P>Probus's probity as to par. 9th would have been more evident, had he made numerical references to authors by name, and his good &s;en&s;e will be indi&s;putable, when he &s;hall have pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the relation of that and the 10th par. to the occa&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent di&s;putes.</P>
<P>In par 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th and 12th, Probus &s;hews &s;uch va&s;t political abili|ties, he mu&s;t needs be a clergyman; if made a &s;tateman, i. e. a Bi&s;hop, doubtle&s;s he would &s;oon &s;mell out a thou&s;and factions, cabals, con&s;piracies, and &s;ecret machinations, no one but him&s;elf ever dreamt of. He already from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance &s;mells po|pery in New-York. He expects there are even Je&s;uits here, and for his &s;u&s;picions gives two and a hall rea&s;ons or &s;ymptoms. 1&s;t Pa|pi&s;ts, and none el&s;e, place the reformation in a di&s;advantageous light:&mdash;The Whig has done this: ergo, he's a je&s;uit." Now Papi&s;ts blame the reformation &s;o far as it was, and the Whig &s;o far as it <HI>was not</HI> a reformation&mdash;both the &s;ame thing, you know, gentle Sir! 2dly, there is a furious outcry rai&s;ed again&s;t Bi&s;hops in New-York, and this tallies exactly with the &s;entiments of Papi&s;ts; ergo, There are Je&s;uits in New-York. Now you know, &s;ir, the mo&s;t artful method to promote the &s;uce&s;s of any obnoxious project, is to rai&s;e a &s;urious outcry again&s;t &s;omething very much like it. 3dly. The &s;u&s;picion heightening half &s;ymptom, is, "that the faction has made no clamour or noi&s;e, about the popi&s;h Bi&s;hop of Quebec." Now, had he been &s;ent to New-York, in&s;tead on rai&s;ing a furious outcry, no donot the faction would have quietly and peaceably &s;ubmitted to his

<P>Par. 13th, contains the old doleful ditty encore, &s;et to the &s;ame mournful air da capo.

<P>TO my corre&s;pondent's ob&s;ervations, I beg leave to add, that tho' (even according to Tory hi&s;torians) Henry VIII. re|nounced the Pope's &s;upremacy, &s;uppre&s;s'd mona&s;tries, &amp;c. in &s;pite of clerical oppo&s;ition, and &s;everal rebellions, and at length arbitra|triry frighted his &s;ubjects, (even tho&s;e of the convocation) into com|plai&s;ance; yet it were doubtle&s;s very rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the reformation was effected with great mildne&s;s and Chri&s;tian tem|per, con&s;idering, &amp;c. and not &s;o much by force as the Whig re|pre&s;ents: And that, tho' Queen Mary's parliament renounced the reformation, which had been approved and confirmed by parliament, under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. yet we are not from thence to conclude, but that the mo&s;t (e&s;pecially the cler|gy,) embrac'd it for con&s;cience &s;ake.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, June 30. The CENTINEL. No. XV.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING has occa&s;ioned greater mi&s;takes, nor given room for warmer debates, than the varying and un&s;ettled meaning of names and terms. A word, which in one age, has &s;erved to convey a particular idea, at &s;ome &s;ucceeding period, has been under&s;tood in a very different &s;en&s;e; and con|trover&s;ial
<PB N="271" REF="010857_0136_0F851EFA9F05E8E8">writers have been &s;o candid as to &s;tate the difference: more eager for victory, than truth, they have often di&s;ingenuou&s;|ly laid hold of &s;uch an opportunity, to carry their point with the ignorant and prejudiced; whil&s;t ever thing has made again&s;t them, except the con&s;truction and &s;ound of the &s;yllables.</P>
<P>This has been remarkably the ca&s;e of the epi&s;copal character in the Chri&s;tian church. Many, who have no idea of a bi&s;hop, &s;eparate from the appendages of the office in &s;ome hierarchies, when they read any thing in the new te&s;tament concerning this mini&s;ter of religion, apply it without he&s;itation to prelates of the e&s;tabli&s;hment they are be&s;t acquainted with; and wonder at the prever&s;ene&s;s of tho&s;e who differ from them. Few profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity deny bi&s;hops to be of divine in&s;titution; but the dif|ficulty lies in adju&s;ting their rank and powers. The Roman, the Greek, and other ea&s;tern churches hold, that bi&s;hops are of di|vine right, an order &s;uperior to prie&s;ts; and that although they are pre&s;byters, they have al&s;o an higher character, and are di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the other clergy, in like manner, as the apo&s;tles in the infancy of the church, were &s;uperior to the common teach|ers of the go&s;pel. The prote&s;tant communions abroad, Lutheran and Calvini&s;t, have rejected this opinion as un&s;criptural, as having been the &s;ource of much abu&s;e and corruption. The &s;en&s;e of the Prote&s;tants of the German empire on this point, is &s;et forth in the articles of the league concluded at Smalcald in 1530; in which they a&s;&s;ert the power of ordaining to belong, by divine right, to pre&s;byters. Accordingly the Lutheran &s;uper-intendants are only fir&s;t among equals, or &s;tanding pre&s;idents of the councils of the clergy. It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that the churches of the reformed, and the church of Scotland, have agreed in the aboli|tion of all prelacy; for with them every pari&s;h mini&s;ter is a bi&s;hop. In England the e&s;tabli&s;hed church has never explicitly declared her&s;elf on the point; if we attempt to deduce her judgment from her conduct, we &s;hall find it un&s;ettled; yet more favourable to the di&s;tinction of order in latter times, than formerly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the reigns of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and <HI>James I.</HI> many divines ordained a|broad by pre&s;byters, were admitted to pari&s;hes in England; but &s;ince the re&s;toration, all the prote&s;tant ordinations are treated as invalid, and orders from dioce&s;an bi&s;hops in&s;i&s;ted on.</NOTE> The fir&s;t reformers in England, with Dr. Cranmer at their head, perfectly agreed with their brethren the prote&s;tants abroad, and held pre&s;byter and bi&s;hop to be the &s;ame in &s;cripture.

As it was natural for the Chri&s;tians in the purer ages of the church to place the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of their elders in the chair, it is ea&s;y to conceive, how &s;uperior abilities and character on the one hand, and undi&s;|&s;embled love and re&s;pect on the other, might con&s;pire to give a fatherly pre-eminence to a primitive bi&s;hop. His age and &s;tand|ing, not to mention the &s;ufferings which many of them endured, would unavoidably command this, and every other expre&s;&s;ion of reverence, which the members of a voluntary &s;ociety, un&s;u&s;pici|ous of any ambitious &s;chemes, could give. It would of cour&s;e happen that the bi&s;hop and the more aged pre&s;byters would al|ways be re&s;ident near the mother church or cathedral, whil&s;t their younger brethren itinerated thro' the pari&s;h, labouring from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and in the dependent places of public wor&s;hips: The bi&s;hop would be generally deputed to &s;it in the &s;ynods and councils of the church: And nothing of importance would be undertaken at home, without the advice of a per&s;on of &s;o much experience and piety.</P>
<P>In all popular a&s;&s;emblies, great regard is paid to the opinion of a few of the be&s;t ability and mo&s;t knowledge; but if a great mo|ral character accompanies the&s;e endowments, the influence of &s;uch per&s;ons is almo&s;t unlimitted</P>
<P>Such &s;eems to have been the ri&s;e of the dioce&s;an bi&s;hop; an office not known in Scripture. The very large extent of the dioce&s;es in &s;ome parts, and the general conver&s;ion of the pagans (probably &s;o called from <HI>pagi,</HI> a word &s;ignifying the people of the country) mu&s;t have increa&s;ed and confirmed the &s;uperiority of the bi&s;hop. As the people became too numerous to a&s;&s;emble and con|&s;ider of their affairs, on every occa&s;ion, the care of them de|volved to the con&s;i&s;tory; and the duties of in&s;truction calling out the younger pre&s;byters to different parts of the di&s;trict, the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of di&s;cipline now increa&s;ed, and occuring daily, gradually centered in the bi&s;hop and the aged elders, who remained with him. Hence ro&s;e the Chapter, or that body of clergy, who at this day make a mock choice of the bi&s;hop, and are as a council

<P>When wealth and corruption entered the church and lovers of Pre-eminence got into the Epi&s;copal &s;ees, that authority which had been conceded to the per&s;onal character of the former pre&s;i|dents of the clergy, was now claimed by, and yielded to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as their proper juri&s;diction. In&s;tead of flying from a &s;ta|tion, which formerly had &s;et a man up as an object of per&s;ecution, and which was thought to require an uncommon &s;hare of zeal and faithfulne&s;s to di&s;charge its duties with a good con&s;cience, the vain and the ambitious &s;ecretly intrigued for Votes, and u&s;ed every artifice to arrive at a dignity, endowed with riches, and con&s;equently inve&s;ted with &s;tate influence and worldly power. The&s;e abu&s;es, of which the prince had by his in&s;idious liberality been the chief author, ri&s;ing into tumults and even blood&s;hed, gave him a &s;pecious pretence, for taking from the people, their right of choo&s;ing their bi&s;hops, and to farther deba&s;e the church and clergy, by turning religion into a &s;tate engine.</P>
<P>The See of Rome was tainted very early. This aro&s;e partly from the great benefactions entru&s;ted with her bi&s;hops, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ending out mi&s;&s;ionaries to the northern and we&s;tern parts of Europe; which al&s;o &s;erved to advance their Influence, and promote their authority, even under the lo&s;s of the &s;eat of empire, which was transferred to Con&s;tantinople. The bi&s;hop|rick of Rome therefore became early the object of competition a|mong tho&s;e who &s;ought after filthy lucre, and were di&s;po&s;ed to

<P>To tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t acquainted with church hi&s;tory, it &s;eems &s;trange to find Dr. Chandler arguing, that dioce&s;an Epi&s;|copacy mu&s;t have been the original plan of government in the church, becau&s;e of the &s;uppo&s;ed difficulty of altering things con|nected with religion. I would a&s;k him, whence came arch-bi&s;h|ops and patriarchs? Whence aro&s;e that grand corruption of Chri&s;tianity called popery? The truth is, the alteration was gradual, and at the time of his favourite St. Ignatius, the bi&s;h|op was, as primate Ul&s;ter wonds it, "only different in degree, not in order:" as a Lutheran &s;uper-intendant at this day pre&s;ides over a con&s;i&s;tory of pa&s;tors. To bring in the Epi&s;copacy of the 1&s;t. and 2d. centuries, then, to &s;upport that of the church of England, is plainly begging the que&s;tion. It is to treat two characters as the &s;ame, who in fact are as different as the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury in England, and the lord high trea|&s;urer; or as the Doge of Venice, the pre&s;ident of that republic, and the ab&s;olute duke of Florence.</P>

<P>ALTHO' I profe&s;s my&s;elf an independent, I &s;hall neverthele&s;s always bear public te&s;timony, as I ever have done, again&s;t all mea&s;ures that &s;eem calculated to injure the general intere&s;t of religion. Nor &s;hall I at any time, be a&s;hamed to reprehend even tho&s;e of my own per&s;ua&s;ion, who&s;e proceedings may have the &s;ame tendency, tho' de&s;igned to an&s;wer a different purpo&s;e; or tho&s;e who fal&s;e to our cau&s;e, and true to none, &s;ee the con&s;equen|ces in a ju&s;t light, and yet continue to u&s;e means which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity produce them. Now, &s;ince the American Whig, the Centinel, and Dr. Chauncey, have undertaken (to &s;peak in their own polite manner) to grea&s;e the wheels of that carriage, which lays down a load of &s;candal at each man's door who happens to di&s;|&s;ent&mdash;&s;trange! that they &s;hould hate di&s;&s;enters&mdash;from their opi|nions; I have made the few following remarks upon the&s;e men's &s;pirit and behaviour, which are at your &s;ervice; tho' I mu&s;t can|didly own, that I &s;hould not have u&s;ed your paper as a channel of conveyance to the publick, for my &s;entiments, had I not been ap|prehen&s;ive that the writers of my own denomination would want both fortitude to acknowledge,&mdash;and by publi&s;hing my reprehen|&s;ions
<PB N="277" REF="010857_0139_0F851EFCE49251E8">they mu&s;t have acknowleged&mdash;their faults, and ingenuity to amend them.</P>
<P>Some time ago, eighteen pre&s;byterian par&s;ons, (or more pro|perly independents) under the unaccountable influence of &s;ome delu&s;ion or other, recommended in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;|creet, tho' it mu&s;t be owned, in the mo&s;t mode&s;t, dutiful, and decent manner, a per&s;on who had de&s;erted our cau&s;e, or was thought to have done &s;o, to the favour and patronage of one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and mo&s;t virtuous prelates in Chri&s;tendom; from whom nothing le&s;s could be expected, than the very genteel reprimand, with which he conde&s;cended to honour them. I then gave them a proper cha&s;ti&s;ement for their mi&s;conduct; which, it is true, <HI>they,</HI> and the <HI>public</HI> received in a very different manner. But I hoped however that they were not &s;o far lo&s;t to their cau&s;e, and to them&s;elves, as to have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again, while their backs are yet reeking from the la&s;h of publick indignation, by fall|ing upon &s;chemes, under pretence, at lea&s;t, and perhaps with a de&s;ign, of &s;upporting our cau&s;e, which have a direct tendency to ruin and &s;ubvert it. But how infecurely my hopes were founded, every week's experience doth again, and again, convince me&mdash;Once more therefore, am I obliged to take upon me the di&s;agree|able, tho' nece&s;&s;ary office of detecting the trea&s;ons, of our pre|tended friends, but real enemies, or correcting the errors (to give them the &s;ofte&s;t Name) of our very true brethren, but very incompetent advocates; I mean (what my reader already under|&s;tands) the American Whig, the Philadelphia Centinel, and Aberratious Doctor.</P>
<P>All the&s;e write with great warmth again&s;t bi&s;hops; but then, alas! their zeal is without knowlege, policy, or purdence. The Whig, in his third numb. has ca&s;t the mo&s;t odious reflections up|on the reformation it&s;elf, that the keene&s;t malice could invent;&mdash;and the Centinel, in his &s;ixth numb. has repre&s;ented the clergy of al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> denominations, and in every age, as the greate&s;t villains that ever exi&s;ted. Now the world will naturally &s;uppo&s;e that he is more acquainted with the clergy of his own denomination, than with tho&s;e of any other; and if people go a &s;tep farther, (as it is natural enough to believe they will) and &s;uppo&s;e (which is al&s;o rea&s;onable enough to be &s;uppo&s;ed) that the clergy of mo&s;t other denominations, would not admit &s;uch a railing accu&s;er many times into their company; their conclu&s;ion (a probable on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at lea&s;t) will be this, that, if he is an hone&s;t man, he has paint|ed his own teachers in the colours which mo&s;t aptly repre&s;ent their genuine complection; but that let him be as hone&s;t as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will, he cannot be depended upon for the de&s;cription of other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whom he hath not had adequate opportunities of knowing; and
<PB N="278" REF="010857_0140_0F851EFDB1DE5B80">whom it is probable he hath no acquaintance with at all; but that he mu&s;t have formed his notions of all, from his knowledge of one particular &s;ect; and becau&s;e they are all clothed in black, have concluded them all together the children of darkne&s;s. This is acting &s;trangely indeed! as if a &s;tatuary, who was ordered to make a mo&s;t delicate re&s;emblance of an <HI>Adonis,</HI> or a <HI>Ganymede,</HI> according to the be&s;t Ideas of their beauty he could form by the livelie&s;t de&s;criptions of the poets, &s;hould, in order to avoid the trouble of &s;earching, or for any other cau&s;e, (it matters not what) immediately turn to Homer, and chizel out an Image of Ther&s;ites. 'Tis as if a painter &s;hould &s;et Otway's Witch before him, while he was drawing a portrait of a Venus, or a Hellen. The&s;e are the conclu&s;ions, I &s;ay, that people who do not think with us, will be apt to form, and which it's too evident the Worthies above-mentioned either intended to &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;o are fal&s;e brethren, or el&s;e they &s;poke at random, and therefore are not properly qualified for the office which they have a&s;&s;umed, viz. That of defenders general of the faith, which is one word more than his maje&s;ty him&s;elf claims in his title, and which, when taken in this Sen&s;e, viz. The faith of independents, or in|dependent faith, or faith on which there is no dependence; re|quires a much &s;tronger advocacy than they (&s;weet babes!) are able to afford it.</P>
<P>This is one in&s;tance either of treachery or want of prudence. Another is, that they,&mdash;I &s;ay they, for I doubt not that what one a&s;&s;erts, the other will &s;wear to&mdash;did publickly accu&s;e a convention of Epi&s;copalians, of writing a number of petitions to &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;onages in England, in order to have a bi&s;hop appointed for America;&mdash;which application, in|dependent as I avow my&s;elf, I cannot in my con&s;cience either blame them for making, or think that their reque&s;t ought not to be granted;&mdash;and al&s;o of &s;aying &s;undry things therein to the di&s;advantage of di&s;&s;enters.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the former part of this accu&s;ation, my &s;entiments are as above: With regard to the latter, our defenders,&mdash;(would not protectors, think you, Mr. Tickle, be a more &s;ignificant term?)&mdash;have produced no evidence to &s;upport their charge. If they had evidence, why did they not produce it! If they had no evidence, and it was all poetical imagination, or, what they thought, probable conjec|ture,&mdash;and why they did think it probable becometh not me to &s;ay,&mdash;why did they bring the accu&s;ation &s;o openly? unle&s;s it were purpo&s;ely done to betray our cau&s;e, and give the enemy an advantage over us. For a calumny un&s;upported, will for ever recoil upon the head of the propagator. The public will
<PB N="279" REF="010857_0140_0F851EFDB1DE5B80">always judge according to evidence; in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, they will condemn our protectors, and acquit the convention.</P>
<P>The Whig, and the Centinel, of all men, ought to be deep politicians: But they &s;eem to be perfectly de&s;titute of every qualification, &s;ave one,&mdash;and that one is not Chicanery,&mdash; which helps to form that modern character. Nothing could be|tray their inabilities in this re&s;pect, &s;o much, as their endeavour|ing to repre&s;ent the church of England in the light of a per&s;ecu|ting church. Who could not have fore&s;een,&mdash;that could &s;ee be|fore his no&s;e,&mdash;that this repre&s;entation would put men upon making compari&s;ons; which, in this ca&s;e more e&s;pecially, are odi|ous, as they can only turn out to the advantage of the church, and the real mortification of us and our Zion.</P>
<P>How impolitic was it likewi&s;e, both in the Whig and Centinel, to cry out for the liberty of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, at the &s;ame time they are oppo&s;ing that liberty, and endeavouring with all their might to preclude a great,&mdash;was it con&s;i&s;tent with my profe&s;&s;ion, I would add a good&mdash;part of tho&s;e &s;ame Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in America, from the enjoyment of that liberty; I mean the mo&s;t valuable branch of it, even in their own profe&s;&s;ion, the liberty of religion; wherewith I always was wont to think that Chri&s;t had made them, as well as our&s;elves, free? every rea&s;on|ing creature mu&s;t at length perceive&mdash;whatever mi&s;ts are rai&s;ed to perplex and bewilder the unthinking traveller in his journey thro' the mazes of controver&s;y,&mdash;that the liberty of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that tho&s;e &s;ubjects have a right, if they choo&s;e the enjoyment of it, to bi&s;hops, with all the powers they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in Britain? But if the bi&s;hops that are prayed for, are to be ve&s;ted with no civil power, who does not &s;ee that it would be manife&s;t inju&s;tice, a mo&s;t palpable infringement of every thing that is right and rea&s;onable, to impede their arrival? And if Bi&s;hops are an ob&s;truction to the liberty of Di&s;&s;enters in England, by rea&s;on of the civil powers wherewith they are there inve&s;ted; who can be &s;o perver&s;e as not to acknowledge, that, upon the plan of the appeal, the Di&s;&s;enters in this country would not have any cau&s;e of complaint; becau&s;e none of our liberties could thereby be po&s;&s;ibly affected? Nay, I might a&s;k farther, &s;up|po&s;ing &s;ome complaints of our brethren in England, be founded in ju&s;tice, would it not be unju&s;tifiable in us to depre&s;s our fellow-&s;ubjects in this part of the world, with &s;imilar hard&s;hips, be|cau&s;e &s;ome burthens continue there unremoved, which the church|men here cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had any hand in impo&s;ing? Suppo&s;e the parliament &s;hould grant the&s;e men their reque&s;t, which is, that they may have the rights of Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects; and &s;hould moreover &s;end bi&s;hops to America, with all the
<PB N="280" REF="010857_0141_0F851EFE64623968">powers, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, which they enjoy in Britain; is it not plain that this would be Briti&s;h liberty? But if the epi&s;co|pal party make no &s;uch reque&s;t, and only a&s;k for bi&s;hops to or|dain, and govern the clergy, &s;hould not we be more ready, on our own principles, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, than to ob&s;truct, &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o mode&s;t a de&s;ign? May they not fairly con|clude, that we are, in heart, enemies to that religious Freedom, which our tongues &s;o ju&s;tly extol, if we continue any longer to ob&s;truct its e&s;tabli&s;hment?</P>
<P>As for the doctor above-mentioned, he has acted altogether beneath the character of an hone&s;t man: and has thus laid him|&s;elf open to &s;o much cen&s;ure and reproof, that whatever he ad|vances for the future, mu&s;t rather di&s;&s;erve than promote our in|tere&s;t. His intentions in &s;o doing are be&s;t known to him&s;elf; but the con&s;equences are not to be avoided.</P>
<P>Out of the many fal&s;hoods he has publi&s;hed, I &s;hall at this time, &s;elect but one, which is this; that all the candidates for holy or|ders in the church of England, have the expences of their voyage home, paid by the &s;ociety, &amp;c. The &s;ociety, as I and every one el&s;e can &s;ee, publi&s;h every year an exact account of the monies they receive, and of the purpo&s;es to which they are ap|plied. If he can produce one in&s;tance, wherein the expences at|tending the voyage of any one candidate for orders, have been defrayed in the manner he mentions, it is more than I have ever &s;een; and I think, from my &s;crupulous in&s;pection into the &s;ocie|ty's ab&s;tracts. I may venture to affirm that none is to be found. Let the candid therefore, of all denominations, judge (for in &s;pite of the doctor, and all our other advocates, they will judge for them&s;elves,) what &s;pirit it was that dictated &s;o infamous an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The doctor, too &s;urely, in this in&s;tance has endeavoured to impo&s;e wretchedly upon the public. If he did it wickedly, (which I mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e) he is an improper in&s;trument to ad|vance the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s; if he did it weakly, (which I cannot &s;uppo&s;e, as information was &s;o ea&s;ily to be ob|tained) he has proved (as the Whig and Centinel, have done al|&s;o,) that his abilities are not equal to the ta&s;k which he has under|taken, and therefore, that our cau&s;e can hope for no advantages from his feeble efforts to &s;upport it. In &s;hort, if he has nothing better to &s;ay, than what he has already advanced, every man who wi&s;hes well either to him&s;elf or his neighbour, will de&s;ire him to put his hand upon his mouth, and &s;ay nothing. If this will not prevent him from injuring both our own cau&s;e, and the general cau&s;e of religion, he is hereby interdicted from any far|ther

<P>WHEN a writer indulges him&s;elf in round a&s;&s;ertions, as the ba&s;is of any &s;cheme, his abilities mu&s;t indeed be &s;lender if the &s;uper &s;tructure is not, at lea&s;t, unblemi&s;hed with tho&s;e gro&s;s irregularities, which at fir&s;t view offend the eye of the under&s;tanding. It is upon a foundation of this &s;ort, that Doctor Chandler builds one of his mo&s;t cogent arguments, in favour of his darling epi&s;copate, to induce tho&s;e, whom he calls "The guardians of our national intere&s;ts" to adopt his plan; and le&s;t "they &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ible to motives" of "a religious na|ture, he thought it prudent to a&s;&s;ail them with political con&s;ider|ations. But the&s;e, he mu&s;t confe&s;s, can have little weight, unle&s;s they derive it from the a&s;&s;ertion, <Q>that the church of England, in its external polity, is &s;o happily connected, and interwoven with the civil con&s;titution, that each mutually &s;upports, and is &s;upported by the other.</Q> A curious picture this, were it ju&s;t, of the blind leading the blind! it is, however, a &s;ignal in|&s;tance of conde&s;cen&s;ion, in &s;o brave a champion for the hierarchy, to admit, that it is in any wi&s;e &s;upported by the &s;tate. What prodigious effects will a change in government have, upon men's private opinions! Tho&s;e of the doctor's kidney would have &s;corned &s;o degrading a &s;toop, before the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the clergy, and the &s;tatute that declared king H. 8, the &s;upreme head of the Anglican church. But in&s;tead of amu&s;ing the attention of my readers, with reflections on tho&s;e le&s;&s;ions of humility, which haughty ecle&s;ia&s;tics are frequently obliged to read to them&s;elves, &s;ince the expul&s;ion of papal authority, I &s;hall proceed to que&s;tion the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, by the omnipotence of which, &s;o much execution is expected to be done in the field of polities.</P>
<P>That the church of England is connected and interwoven with the civil con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, as far as it re&s;pects Eng|land,
<PB N="282" REF="010857_0142_0F851EFF2A8CD280">Ireland, the principality of Wales, and the town of Ber|wick upon Tweed, cannot be denied: That it has not the lea&s;t relation to that con&s;titution, as it concerns Scotland, and the colonies in general, is equally true; but that its connection with the civil con&s;titution in England, is either happy for the &s;tate, tho' it certainly is for the church according to Doctor Chandler's &s;en&s;e of the word, or &s;upports it, tho' it is indeed &s;upported by the &s;tate, is a po&s;ition, which every &s;ound whig is bound to deny. The &s;ubject of enquiry, therefore in this paper, will be, whe|ther that part of the Briti&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pire, to which the church of England extends, or the colonies, in which the Doctor would erect his qualified epi&s;copacy, can derive happine&s;s, or the &s;tate re|ceive &s;upport from either. If we look into the hi&s;tory of Eng|land, before the abolition of the papacy, we &s;hall find, that the church was ever inimical to the &s;tate. The Pope not only claimed, but, as often as he could, exerci&s;ed a &s;upremacy over both; &s;ometimes excommunicating the king, and di&s;charging his &s;ub|jects from the bond of allegiance; at other times, laying the whole realm under an interdict;&mdash;anon di&s;po&s;ing of the king|dom, by his apo&s;tlic authority, to any foreigner who would at|tempt the conque&s;t of it; perpetually draining it of its wealth, by the unrighteous levy of Peter-Pence, and the continual exacti|on of annates, or fir&s;t fruits, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical impo&s;ts; convoking all &s;piritual cau&s;es, in their la&s;t remove, before the vatican; pre&s;iding, by his legate, at the &s;ynods and convocations of the Engli&s;h clergy; di&s;po&s;ing of vacant &s;ees to foreigners, who in right of their temporalities, and with hearts alienated from the &s;tate, took their &s;eats in parliament; and not only had great weight in council; but, in &s;ome in&s;tances, bore the princi|pal &s;way in the political movements of the &s;tate: While, to crown the power and independency of the Hierarchy, holy church, was, by magna charta, declared to be free; and main|tained this freedom, to &s;o high a pitch, as not only to make her &s;piritual courts a terror to all the king's &s;ubjects, but even to claim a con&s;titutional exemption from civil juri&s;diction, in the perpe|tration of the mo&s;t flagitious crimes. That this is a ju&s;t picture of holy church, as &s;he was formerly connected and interwoven with the &s;tate, is unque&s;tionably verified, by hi&s;torical evidence. It is indeed too ju&s;t and &s;triking a de&s;cription, of the outlines of her external polity, to be di&s;owned by any &s;on of the church. Such was the indulgent mother, before the reformation. But who does not &s;ee, that this external polity, &s;o far from being friendly to monarchy, was a bitter enemy to all government? Could the chief magi&s;trate, under any form of civil rule what&s;o|ever, be &s;ecure in his &s;eat? Could he guard the nation again&s;t
<PB N="283" REF="010857_0142_0F851EFF2A8CD280">foreign attempts, or protect it again&s;t internal convul&s;ions, while &s;o much power was attached to the church, which was &s;o wholly at the di&s;po&s;al of the Pope? It was utterly impo&s;&s;ible. In&s;tead of exalting our idea of the monarch, it actually deba&s;ed him; &s;o far deba&s;ed him, as in one in&s;tance to exhibit maje&s;ty it&s;elf, acting the groveling character of a groom, to an in&s;olent eccle|&s;ia&s;tic. In&s;tead of giving us &s;ecurity and &s;trength again&s;t our enemies, it expo&s;ed the kingdom to become their &s;poil, by colour of a pontifical bull; it opened a &s;luice for draining the nation of its wealth, the principal &s;inew of national power; it expo&s;ed the whole&s;ome Engli&s;h con&s;titution, to fatal changes, by the influ|ence of foreigners, in the legi&s;lature, in the courts of ju&s;tice, and in the council of &s;tate; it armed the &s;ubject again&s;t his Prince; In &s;hort, it was the mo&s;t deadly adver&s;ary to the public weal, even had England been an ab&s;olute monarchy. And yet the church was as much, and how happily let the reader judge, connected and interwoven with the &s;tate, before, as it ever has been &s;ince the reformation.</P>
<P>We are next to enquire, what mighty changes have been wrought, at or &s;ince that memorable event, which could po&s;&s;ibly render that connection more happy to the &s;tate, than in times of popery. In this re&s;earch, it will be ju&s;t to confine our attention, merely to the external polity, without regard to the internal changes in doctrine, di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, which the reforma|tion gradually, and in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns, effected in the Anglican church. Before this Aera, the Bi&s;hop of Rome was its &s;upreme head on earth. By the reformation his holine&s;s was dethroned; and whom the clergy of England made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, how free and uncon&s;trained let hi&s;tory declare: All dependance on or connection with the pontifical &s;ee, was ab&s;olutely and total|ly re&s;cinded. The king, by another act, was made the fountain of all the benefices of the &s;uperior clergy; the meer form, only, of election, being re&s;erved to the Dean and Chapter, to be ex|erci&s;ed in favour of tho&s;e, whom his Maje&s;ty, by his letters mi&s;|&s;ive, &s;hould appoint. The clergy were al&s;o rendered re&s;pon&s;ible in criminal matters, before the king's temporal courts of ju&s;tice, but continued in the exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction, over the &s;ub|ject, in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts. The mona&s;tic prie&s;thood was, by other legi&s;lative provi&s;ions, laid low in the du&s;t; the abbies and mona&s;teries were di&s;&s;olved; and their temporalities ye&s;ted in the crown, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for the endowment of &s;chools, and other charitable and religious u&s;es: And by this means, twenty-&s;even lazy Abbots were turned out of parliament; and in their &s;tead, fix new bi&s;hopricks were erected by the king, in virtue of an
<PB N="284" REF="010857_0143_0F851EFFDE870488">act of legi&s;lation. The prelates, however, remained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;eats in parliament. The convocation of the clergy &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, as before the reformation; and &s;till con&s;titutionally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, tho' the wi&s;dom and lenity of the Hanover family forbids the exerci&s;e of their dreadful power, by re&s;training them from pro|ceeding to bu&s;ine&s;s; and the juri&s;diction of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, &s;ave only in a &s;ew ca&s;es, is yet entire. This, I believe, is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent external polity of the Angli|can church, as far as re&s;pects the &s;uperior clergy. It therefore follows, that if the &s;tate derives happine&s;s and &s;upport from the church, or if the civil con&s;titution harmonizes with it, this happine&s;s, this &s;upport, this harmony mu&s;t be evinced, in one or more of the following particulars. Fir&s;t; that the king is by law, the &s;upreme head of the Anglican church. Secondly; that he has the ap|pointment of all the &s;piritual lords in the realm. Thirdly; that tho&s;e lords make a part of the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain. Fourthly; that they are authorized to hold &s;piritual courts in England, for puni&s;hing offenders,&mdash;again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tical law. Fifthly; that the king has authority to &s;ummon the convo|cation, and to permit them to make canons; to which, as well as to all others now in &s;orce, all the inhabitants of South-Britain are bound, under temporal penalties, to &s;ay yea and amen. When I con&s;ider the Doctor's a&s;&s;ertions, I am in charity, and to avoid a more &s;evere imputation, obliged to doubt his acquaintance with the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. For I verily am at a lo&s;s, upon comparing it with the external polity of the Anglican church, to di&s;cover in what particulars, his boa&s;ted reciprocation of happi|ne&s;s, &s;upport, and harmony con&s;i&s;ts. It is evident that the King not only is the &s;upreme, but the ab&s;olute monarch of the church. And is his authority &s;o uncontroulable in the &s;tate? It is as clear, that the people have not the lea&s;t &s;hare, in the con&s;truction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws; but who is ignorant, that in temporal legi&s;la|tion, they have a principal and e&s;&s;ential agency? In the church, the upper hou&s;e of convocation, from the nature of their ap|pointment, are real &s;laves to the crown; the lower hou&s;e are their mere dependant creatures. In the &s;tate, the temporal lords have a noble hereditary independency, the commons are &s;ervants during good behaviour to the people. In the church, the judges are as &s;ub&s;ervient as the legi&s;lators: In the &s;tate, the oracles of the law hold their offices, by the free&s;t tenure, during good be|haviour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing of which, while our fellow &s;ubjects in England and Ireland are in the full enjoyment of it, the coloni&s;ts by an odious de&s;parity are deprived.</NOTE> Or &s;hould they both be thought to hang upon the
<PB N="285" REF="010857_0143_0F851EFFDE870488">favour of the crown, with an eye to promotion, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges are makers and pronouncers of the law, and triers of the facts; but the temporal judges are only &s;peakers, of what inde|pendent of their authority is e&s;tabli&s;hed law, while the people determine facts. In &s;hort, none are &s;o blindly ignorant, unle&s;s the Doctor &s;hould be &s;o, as not to &s;ee, that if our con&s;titution is a monarchy, it differs widely from all other monarchical govern|ments in the world. It is a monarchy, two of the grand ingre|dients in which, are, that the people, in the common law courts, are ab&s;olute judges of facts, upon which the law mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e, either pro or con, as the facts are found; and that in legi&s;|lation, they have two voices in three. But do we di&s;cover the lea&s;t re&s;emblance of tho&s;e popular rights, in the church? Do we behold the laity &s;itting either in the &s;eat of the law-giver or in judgment?&mdash;Not at all; in things &s;o &s;acred they may not intermeddle; <HI>odi profanum vulgus et arceo.</HI> If they feel the powers of the one, or the other, it is not by participating in the exertions of either, but by &s;ubmitting to the weight of both; as the a&s;s that beareth the burden. But the temporal powers of the &s;uperior clergy &s;hew, in a &s;triking point of light, how little har|mony, at lea&s;t in theory, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political &s;tate of England. The right of the &s;piritual lords to &s;it in parliament, which the advocates for the church have ever, and with a good deal of rea&s;on, e&s;teemed a &s;piritual right, is, by the true friends of liberty, regarded with as jealous an eye, as are the borough repre&s;entations, in the hou&s;e of commons. This right of the clergy, is a real deformity in the con&s;titution; and con|travenes the very principles, on which the Briti&s;h parliament is built. The &s;everal parts of that augu&s;t body, as con&s;i&s;ting of three e&s;tates, ought legally and ab&s;olutely to be independent, in the exerci&s;e of authority, each of the other: And yet, in the hou&s;e of Peers, there are no le&s;s than twenty-&s;ix unapo&s;tolical eccle&s;ia&s;tical lords, ever regarded by their lay-fellows, with a mixture of di&s;gu&s;t and contempt; ever dependant on the will of the Prince; for who is not fond of promotion? and too often ready, not only to countenance, but execute court mea&s;ures, as hi&s;tory abundantly &s;hews. While every other per&s;on in that great and mo&s;t illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly, is at lea&s;t con&s;titutionally free. Nay, &s;o very odd and unnatural is this connection, that, I be|lieve, the Doctor is &s;ingular in his opinion, that it is productive of felicity, or gives &s;trength to the &s;tate. The great di&s;&s;imili|tude in the con&s;titutions of &s;tate and church, pardon me good Doctor, for the irreverent tran&s;po&s;ition, affords not, indeed, the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of a mutual interchange of happine&s;s, &s;upport, or harmony. For how can blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience in the
<PB N="286" REF="010857_0144_0F851F00FAB93FB8">church, accord with Engli&s;h liberty in the &s;tate? How can that form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, which either actually or vir|tually lodges all authority in the hands of one per&s;on, and ex|cludes the multitude from all participation, in framing and execu|ting the laws, be &s;aid to be happily connected, and harmonize with, or to have the lea&s;t tendency to &s;upport, that form of civil government, under which the &s;ubject has a nece&s;&s;ary agency, in legi&s;lative and di&s;tributive ju&s;tice? The Doctor &s;hould have hone&s;t|ly, and in plain terms, &s;poke what he really meant; that the hierachy, of which the Prince is the &s;upreme and ab&s;olute head. is mo&s;t happily calculated to indoctrinate the laity, in pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, to an ab&s;olute monarch in the &s;tate. The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion would, at lea&s;t, have been admitted. Yet, why &s;hould an American pre&s;s, groan under the weight of this doctrine? Are we not all free? Or are we indeed bond &s;laves, &s;old under the power of tyrannic &s;way? God forbid the thoughts! We have a Prince and a con&s;titution, friendly to liberty; why then, &s;uch a more than in&s;inuated addre&s;s, to tho&s;e who are in|tru&s;ted with out public affairs? I confe&s;s the Doctor does not a&s;|&s;ert, that <Q>Epi&s;copacy and ab&s;olute monarchy are in their frame, be&s;t &s;uited to each other.</Q> Thus, however, he ought to have &s;poke; or been &s;ilent. They are truly twin &s;i&s;ters, the genuine offspring of certain parents, equally known and de|te&s;ted by every lover of liberty. But by his mealy-mouthed, mincing omi&s;&s;ion of the word ab&s;olute, which, neverthele&s;s, is left to be under&s;tood, by all connoi&s;&s;eurs in the art of unlimit|ted &s;way, he intended to gild the pill; to make it gain an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age into American &s;tomachs. Nor can he e&s;cape with a de|claration, that by monarchy unepithetized, he intended monar|chy in general. For in this view, his doctrine is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e. It includes all mixed, as well as ab&s;olute monarchies. But is it not evident, that ab&s;olute &s;upremacy in the church, and the rights of a free people under a mixed monarchy, form when at|tempted to be pronounced, in union, a mo&s;t jarring di&s;cordant &s;ound? Or &s;hould this be his argument, that as the <Q>Engli&s;h hierachy and ab&s;olute monarchy are in their frame and con&s;ti|tution, be&s;t &s;uited to each other,</Q> &s;o a qualified hierachy, in which the bi&s;hop &s;hould have no other powers than tho&s;e of or|daining and governing the clergy, and confirming the bapti&s;ed, "exactly harmonizes" with our mixed monarchy, let him beware of its con&s;equences. If it &s;hould have &s;trength, &s;ufficient to rear his beloved idol in America, its power may po&s;&s;ibly be felt, in the demolition of that more towering idol, beyond the at|lantic, to make room for the erection of another, that will more "exactly harmonize," with the mixed monarchy of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="287" REF="010857_0144_0F851F00FAB93FB8">empire; an hierachy, in which tho' one &s;hall pre&s;ide, for the &s;ake of order, yet the whole church, including laity and clergy &s;hall give laws and execute ju&s;tice in &s;piritualities. Such an hierachy would indeed bear &s;ome faint re&s;emblance to Epi&s;copacy, &s;uch as it was in the early ages of the church.</P>
<P>But to examine the Doctor's mode of rea&s;oning a little farther; it is plain, that by his &s;cheme of a qualified epi&s;copacy, the laity are, by no means, to be affected. <Q>The di&s;cipline of the church, &s;o far as it relates to the private members, will be left as it is; and nothing further will be done, than refu&s;ing the communion to di&s;orderly and &s;candalous per&s;ons; which every clergymen may now refu&s;e.</Q> And is this all? If &s;o, how is our reli&s;h for a mixed monarchy to be heightened, and improved, by this &s;cheme? The Non-Epi&s;copal clergy, and the laity of all denominations, are not to feel the weight of Epi&s;copal authority. This, it &s;eems, is re&s;erved for the correction of the more ungo|vernable clergy of the church. All other eccle&s;ia&s;tics are to do as they li&s;t; and the people of all per&s;ua&s;ions are to be left to the guidance of their re&s;pective Pre&s;byters, in the exerci&s;e of their authority to exclude from the &s;acrament. This indeed &s;avours of Pre&s;byteriani&s;m. <HI>Expellas naturam &s;urea taemen u&s;que recur|ret.</HI> The prejudices of education, either really exert them&s;elves at times, or our reverend author knows, if he knows nothing el&s;e, how to effect political qualms. But in the mean time, it remains a glaring truth, that, however unque&s;tionable the a&s;&s;ertion may be, that <Q>our civil rulers have always con&s;idered Epi&s;copacy, as the &s;ure&s;t friend to monarchy,</Q> the Doctor's plan of Epi&s;|copacy, is not in the lea&s;t calculated, to merit, on that account, the peculiar attention of <Q>tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with our public concerns.</Q></P>
<P>My readers are, I flatter my&s;elf, now convinced, if they need|ed &s;uch conviction before, that the church of England is not &s;o <Q>happily connected, and interwoven with the civil con&s;titution, that each mutually &s;upports, and is &s;upported by the other; that their harmony</Q> exi&s;ts no where, &s;ave only in the elabo|rate appeal; and that Doctor Chandler's plan, of an American Epi&s;copate, bears not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a re&s;emblance, to the beautiful form of our civil con&s;titution; for which he admits many, and were he di&s;po&s;ed to &s;peak the whole truth, he &s;hould have &s;aid, all <Q>the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, both at home and in the plantations, who reject Epi&s;copacy, are warm,</Q> nay the warme&s;t, "advocates." On the other hand, he can expect little countenance from our civil rulers. They neither de&s;ire, it is to be hoped, to enamourate us with ab&s;olute monarchy; nor are &s;o incompetent, as not to reject his plan of Epi&s;copacy, as an in|adequate
<PB N="288" REF="010857_0145_0F851F01676F7580">engine of ju&s;t government. In &s;hort, his adroitne&s;s is by no means equal, to the &s;till of tho&s;e <Q>artful men, who can rai&s;e objections and difficulties, in the plaine&s;t ca&s;es; and can make any thing, an argument again&s;t any thing, in a way, that &s;hall &s;eem plau&s;ible.</Q> This is a talent, to which, whatever may be the a&s;pirations of his heart, his head is an utter &s;tranger. To retort his own &s;entiment; he rather &s;eems calculated for tho&s;e exerci&s;es, which are "as unworthy of the public attention," as the labours of a child, that "engages in crambo or pu&s;h|pin."</P>

<P>NO le&s;s than two que&s;tions concerning one of the Whig's corre&s;pondents have been di&s;puted, it &s;eems, in &s;everal companies; and Squire T.

Whether his manoevre be his, Printers manoeuvre, is a que&s;tion I &s;hall not decide; but, if &s;everal companies &s;hould di&s;pute it, the di&s;putation might probably be &s;poken of much to the credit of the church of England.</P>
<P>Par. 2d. Squire T. &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e the American church|man, would be glad to &s;ee the church in <HI>puris naturalibus,</HI> with|out a figleaf to cover her &amp;c.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, July 7. THE CENTINEL. NO. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the AUTHOR of the CENTINEL</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE readine&s;s, with which you publi&s;hed the letters, I &s;ent you, emboldens me to offer &s;ome farther thoughts on the &s;ubject. I have endeavoured to &s;hew that the church or rather every church in America has a right in it&s;elf to provide for its own di&s;cipline and government, that if civil laws are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of its clergy, or for the regulation of its members, they ought to be made by the legi&s;latures of the re&s;pective colonies; and therefore that any application to the parliament of Britain, or any power on earth, other than the legi&s;latures of the colonies, to e&s;tabli&s;h any &s;ect or denomination of Chri&s;tians in his maje&s;ty's American colonies, is an infringe|ment of the rights of the people, and as &s;uch ought to be re|&s;ented. I &s;hall now con&s;ider what it is, that Doctor Chandler and the applicants petition for, and hope to convince you, that it is not a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, a publi&s;her of the go&s;pel, nor an officer of the Chri&s;tian church, but a dangerous engine of &s;tate. This will appear if we con&s;ider for what purpo&s;es he is wanted with what powers he is to be inve&s;ted, and in what manner he is to exerci&s;e tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>The liberty of America has ever been a matter of envy to the bigots and high flyers, as well as to the favourers and abettors of arbitrary power in England. In&s;tances of this might be given, from the times of Laud, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oft down to the time of tho&s;e venerable bi&s;hops, who with one accord entered their
<PB N="291" REF="010857_0146_0F851F0221037A20" MS="y">warm prote&s;t again&s;t the repeal of the American &s;tamp act.&mdash;And it might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, that whenever attempts have been made at home to increa&s;e the power of the crown, or &s;ubvert the Briti&s;h con&s;titution and the liberties of the people; the liberty of America has at the &s;ame time been invaded. Nor is this to be wondered at; for while America remains a &s;acred a&s;ylum, &s;he &s;hackles of &s;lavery cannot well be fixed upon Britons, nor can eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyrants exerci&s;e arbitrary &s;way.</P>
<P>But what is particularly worthy of ob&s;ervation is, that every attempt upon American liberty, has always been accompanied with endeavours to &s;ettle bi&s;hops among us. Thus in the reign of Charles I. when Laud attempted to &s;ubjugate the colonies, then in their infancy, he was not content with contriving to cramp their trade by fooli&s;h proclamations:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ru&s;hworth,</HI> Second part. p. 718.</NOTE> but to complete their mortification and effect their ruin, was upon the point of &s;ending them a Bi&s;hop, with a military force to back his authority.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heylin</HI>'s life of Laud. p. 369.</NOTE> the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">pt was revived in the latter end of queen Anne's rei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> und, had not God in his providence inter|po&s;ed, and bla&s;ted the de&s;igns of the enemies of Britain, the &s;ame year might have been remarkable, for the downfal of pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;m. the introduction of the pretender, and the revival of popery in England, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of bi&s;hops in Ame|rica. The un&s;ettled &s;tate of the nation after the acce&s;&s;ion of George I. gave the enemies of that prince and of their coun|try &s;ome faint hopes of accompli&s;hing their de&s;ign; and, there|fore, in the year 1714, while the &s;pirit of rebellion was kindling into a flame, and the friends of Popery and the pretender were forming their party and preparing to overturn the government, and the religion of their country, the &s;ame re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, who in the la&s;t reign had laboured to get bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, 'renewed their attempt, and made one vigorous effort to accom|pli&s;h' what they call their 'grand affair.' But (thanks to the great over-ruler of events) the de&s;igns of both 'proved abor|tive.' The rebellion was qua&s;hed, and the &s;cheme of an Ame|rican epi&s;copate dropt of cour&s;e: Some per&s;ons however &s;till con|tinued to keep &s;ight of the great object, and as they are always watching for &s;ea&s;onable opportunities of exerting them&s;elves to ob|tain it," we find it re&s;umed with great warmth not long before the rebellion in 1745.</P>
<P>With what views a bi&s;hop is &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired for America, and for what purpo&s;es he is &s;ent, we are now to enquire. 'His
<PB N="282" REF="010857_0147_0F851F02E2A2B300" MS="y">'authority,' we are told, '&s;hall operate only on the clergy of the Church and 'not on the laity.' The bi&s;hop &s;poken of in the New-Te&s;tament is ordered to feed the flock, and take care of the church of God. But the American bi&s;hop is to exerci&s;e no authority over the laity or private members of the church, over which he pre&s;ides. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to 'ordain, unite,' &s;up|port and govern the clergy.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A confirmation is al&s;o mentioned as one of the important of|fices of a bi&s;hop, and great &s;tre&s;s &s;eems to be laid on it, by Doctor C. But how high &s;oever the popi&s;h church and its adhe|rents may rate confirmation, and the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the Doctor ought to know, that the church of England, of which he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a member, con&s;iders them in no very favourable light. <Q><HI>Confirmation,</HI> penance, orders, matrimony and extreme unction are not to be accounted for &s;acraments, being &s;uch as are grown, <HI>partly of the CORRUPT following of the apo&s;tles,</HI> partly are &s;tates of life allowed by the &s;criptures. <HI>25</HI> Art. of the Ch. of. Eng.</Q></NOTE> over the&s;e his power is to be ab&s;o|lute. He is to hold no &s;piritual court, p. 95. And yet he is to <Q>have power to &s;u&s;pend any clergyman, to deprive him of his benefice and not only &s;ilence and depo&s;e him but excommu|nicate him from the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians.</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 33.</NOTE> All this he is to exerci&s;e <Q>according to the directions of and by virtue of a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the dioce&s;an,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>B.</HI> 80.</NOTE> who may re&s;ide at London, Lambeth, or el&s;ewhere. This Doctor C. a&s;&s;ures us is 'the plan of the American epi&s;copate, and that he does not know of a &s;ingle in&s;tance wherein rea&s;on has been given to &s;u&s;pect a departure from it.</Q> How well this plan was calculated to an|&s;wer the views of a Laud, who wants to introduce arbitrary government into church and &s;tate, is ea&s;y to &s;ee: Nor will it be difficult to reconcile it with the &s;chemes of tho&s;e, who laboured to introduce Popery and the Pretender.</P>
<P>But to add to the weight and importance of the&s;e bi&s;hops, and the better to enable them to promote the de&s;igns of the mi|ni&s;ter, a hint is given that 'the government may hereafter &s;ee fit to inve&s;t them with &s;ome degree of civil power, worthy of their acceptance;' that as 'a clergyman may be made a ju&s;tice of the peace or a judge of the quorum; &s;o bi&s;hops may be inve&s;ted with a proportionable degree of civil authority;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>C.</HI> 3.</NOTE> which can be no|thing le&s;s than a member of the upper hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly or go|vernor of a province. To this we are told, no one ought to object: For 'all that the happine&s;s and &s;afety of the public
<PB N="283" REF="010857_0147_0F851F02E2A2B300" MS="y">require, is, that the legi&s;lative and execute power be placed in the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons as are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t abili|ties, integrity and prudence; and it is hoped, &s;ays Dr. C. bi&s;hops will always be thought to de&s;erve this character.'</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider what a dangerous engine of &s;tate this might be in the hands of an enterpri&s;ing and ill-minded mini&s;|ter. Where a man's private intere&s;t is united with the intere&s;t of his country, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, he will heartily wi&s;h that country may thrive, and will extert him&s;elf in &s;upport and de&s;ence of its liberty; but this is not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who are &s;ent from another part of the world, to be employed in places of profit and power: Becau&s;e they can bear no affection to the place where they &s;ojourn; their &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s being to advance them|&s;elves by following the directions of their principals: Neither will it be the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who are taken into offices, although natives of the land, becau&s;e they are greater gainers while they keep their offices, than they can be by promoting and defending the intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P>The people of America are to have no concern in the election of this bi&s;hop, over his actions they have no controul. The clergy as they will hold their livings at his plea&s;ure, mu&s;t pay the &s;ame implicit obedience to his commands, which he him&s;elf will always pay to the mini&s;ter of &s;tate, who&s;e creature he is, and on whom his hopes of preferment depend.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore wonder if the admini&s;tration of a B&mdash;e or a G&mdash;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed with an attempt to introduce an Ame|rican epi&s;copate.</P>

<P><Q>I Have engaged in this cour&s;e of periodical papers, as an advocate for the</Q> religious 'liberties' of a very numerous and re&s;pectable body, <Q>of my fellow-&s;ub|jects in North-America. I have entered upon the que&s;tion of an American epi&s;copate, and the' defence 'of Dr. Chand|ler's appeal to the public, in favour of it; as I e&s;teem the
<PB N="294" REF="010857_0148_0F851F05E7C27F50" MS="y">que&s;tion to be of greater importance</Q> to the members of the church of England in America, than any <Q>which affects not the rights of con&s;cience</Q>&mdash;and of &s;ome importance to others, whether they be the friends of religious liberty in general; or, like the American Whig, of that &s;our, &s;pelnetic, perver&s;e, un|chri&s;tian, unbrotherly, inhuman, meager, lean-vi&s;aged di&s;po|&s;ition, which &s;ickens at the &s;ight of other men's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>'The Dr. addre&s;&s;es the public, with an air of the highe&s;t,' and mo&s;t well grounded <Q>a&s;&s;urance, of the propriety and expe|die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his plan; and with de&s;ign, no doubt, to engage his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the immediate pro&s;ecution of it,</Q> he very ju&s;tly ob&s;erven, from the appearance of things, at the time of his writing, <Q>that the apprehen&s;ion of any general popular di&s;con|tent or oppo&s;ition, was entirely groundl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s.</Q> His good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pinion of the di&s;&s;enters, he expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words: <Q>Of any con&s;ide|rable di&s;content or unea&s;ine&s;s, there is no rea&s;on to be appre|hen&s;ive. Whatever notions the di&s;&s;enters of this country may have formerly entertained concerning the church, of late years they have greatly come off from their prejudices&mdash;ex|cepting here and there a hot-headed writer, or a pragramatical enthu&s;ia&s;t,</Q></P>
<P>The Dr. I am per&s;uaded, had good rea&s;ons for his general opinion; but I apprehend him to have been mi&s;taken in one circum&s;tance, as he &s;eems not to have imagined that the number of 'hot-headed writers' again&s;t the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate would be &s;o con&s;iderable as now appears&mdash;and I will not affirm but he may have been al&s;o mi&s;taken as to the real number of <Q>prag|matical enthu&s;ia&s;ts</Q> in this country. But this I do and will affirm, that none but the <Q>hot-headed writers, or pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;ts</Q> afore&s;aid, and &s;uch as have been deceived by the mi&s;repre&s;entations of the former, or the blind zeal of the latter, di&s;cover the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to oppo&s;e the epi&s;copate in que&s;tion&mdash;and that the number of people thus deceived is but &s;mall, in compari&s;on with what the American Whig has re|pre&s;ented it to be. There are many, even among the di&s;&s;enters, upon whom all the &s;ophi&s;try of this writer has had no effect, and who mo&s;t cordially de&s;pi&s;e the low, illiberal, ungenerous, and di&s;hone&s;t arts, whereby he and his a&s;&s;ociates have endeavoured to impo&s;e upon the ignorant and unwary; e&s;teeming them to be an evidence of two Things, which they would willingly conceal, the badne&s;s of their hearts&mdash;and the wretchedne&s;s of the cau&s;e they have undertaken to maintain.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over No. IX. of the Whig, as utterly unworthy of notice; being only a feeble effort to mi&s;repre&s;ent a very harmle&s;s
<PB N="295" REF="010857_0148_0F851F05E7C27F50" MS="y">pa&s;&s;age in the appeal, and pervert it to a &s;en&s;e which, I dare &s;ay, was never once thought of by the author. Be&s;ides, it is &s;uch a Burle&s;que upon &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, that it can|not be read with patience by any one who has the lea&s;t regard for religion, and could only be written by a man lo&s;t to all moral goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tenth production now before me, is <HI>qualis ab incepto,</HI>&mdash;&s;uch as was expected, and &s;uch as will be expected from him as long as he &s;hall continue to write in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y; be|ing one of tho&s;e compounds of mi&s;repre&s;entation, deceit and fal&s;hood, which are incon&s;i&s;tent with common hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>The author of the appeal, after having an&s;were, as he in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gined, all the objections again&s;t an American epi&s;copate which he had ever heard of, &s;ays, with reference to &s;uch-Genius's as our Whig: <Q>It is indeed po&s;&s;ible that other objections may haw been offered, or may be here after &s;ugge&s;ted, again&s;t America<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bi&s;hops; but I am per&s;uaded, that upon examination they wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> generally be found to be proofs, rather of the dexterity, or ill-will of the inventors, than of the real &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and unea&s;ine&s;s of the inhabitants. Artiful men may ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> objections and difficul|ties in the plaine&s;t ca&s;es, and can make any thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> argument again&s;t any thing, in a way that &s;hall appear plau&s;ible to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the legerdemain of cavillers and &s;o|phi&s;ts. But whoever employs his talents in this exerci&s;e, is as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages in crambo or pu&s;h-pin,</Q></P>
<P>Now upon this pa&s;&s;age the que&s;tion ari&s;es, whether the author of the appeal has here &s;aid any thing that cannot be ju&s;tified on the common principles of truth and candour? No &s;mall number of 'artful men' have been for &s;everal months, employed in rai&s;ing objections again&s;t American bi&s;hops; and it is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of every candid and intelligent per&s;on, whether they have yet produced any new objections, but &s;uch as are perhaps, &s;ome &s;mall proof of the 'dexterity,' but which are in reality, a much greater proof of the ill-will of the 'inventors?' Has it not been the &s;tudy of the American Whig, and his confederates, to 'rai&s;e objections and difficulties in the plaine&s;t ca&s;es?' Have they not been &s;ounding a fal&s;e alarm, and aiming to terrify peo|ple with imaginary dangers? Have they not trifled with, and a|bu&s;ed, the patience of the public to that degree, that &s;everal of their quondam friends have de&s;erted them, and others are a&s;ha|med of them? In &s;hort, have they not 'employed their talents' in &s;uch a manner, as to have rendered them&s;elves <Q>as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages in crambo, or pu&s;h-pin?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="010857_0149_0F851F0775ED4470" MS="y">
The author of the appeal is accu&s;ed of thundering out <Q>cleri|cal anathema's' again&s;t his opponents, and of &s;aying, that whoever employs his talents in this exerci&s;e,</Q> that is, gentle reader, &s;ays the Whig. of offering any objections to his darling epi&s;copate, <Q>is as unworthy of the public attention, as the child that engages at crambo or pu&s;h-pin,</Q> the whole pa&s;&s;age of the appeal, upon which the accu&s;ation is founded, is in&s;erted above, and every reader can judge for him&s;elf, whether the author &s;ays any &s;uch thing as he is here made to &s;ay&mdash;or thunders out any &s;uch anathema's as he is made to thunder. He is evidently there con&s;idering, not objectors in general, but one &s;pecies of ob|jectors, namely, 'cavillers and &s;ophi&s;ts,' who by their 'legerde|main' or the tricks of their art, <Q>make any thing appear to be an argument again&s;t any thing,</Q> to the ignorant and inex|perienced. As to open and fair objectors, Dr. Chandler al|ways &s;peaks of them decently and properly, and has declared his readine&s;s to treat them with due re&s;pect. So that the Whig's repre&s;entation of him is deceitful and fal&s;e; it is a prepen&s;ely malicious attempt to impo&s;e upon the good-nature and gentle|ne&s;s of the reader, and merits the re&s;entment of every lover of truth and &s;incerity. He that deceives another, or attempts to deceive him, is no better than a liar; and he that attempts it publickly, is a public liar, and as &s;uch &s;hould be treated. A man had better play at 'cramb&ograve; or pu&s;h-pin' to eternity, than engage in &s;uch practices. And &s;o much for pu&s;h-pin.</P>
<P>The author of the appeal had &s;aid, that he knew of no pub|lic clamour that had ever been made in this country upon the pro&s;pect of an American epi&s;copate, and that he did not &s;ore&s;ee that any would be made. The American Whig al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ows, that perhaps it may have been &s;o&mdash;that Dr. Chandler had neither heard of any, nor did fore&s;ee any. But now, in his turn, he makes his appeal to the Doctor. <Q>whether &s;ince the publication of his appeal, a very general unea&s;ine&s;s is not vi&s;ible among the people; and a general popular oppo&s;ition expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t his epi&s;copal project, among all ranks of men, as they become daily more diffu&s;ively acquainted with the reality of the de|&s;ign.</Q> The Dr. will him&s;elf reply to this appeal, if he thinks it de&s;erves a reply, in due time; in the mean while, if I may be allowed to make &s;o free with his property, I will offer a few words upon it. If by, '&s;ince the publication of the appeal' is meant from the time of its publication, my an&s;wer to the que&s;tion mu&s;t be in the negative. It is well known, that the appeal was publi&s;hed many months before there was any appear|ance of unea&s;ine&s;s on the account of it; nay, &s;o far from it, that it was read by many of the di&s;&s;enters, who declared them|&s;elves
<PB N="297" REF="010857_0149_0F851F0775ED4470">perfectly ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, with regard to the plan, and thought it liable to no rea&s;onable objections.</P>
<P>But is not 'a very general Unea&s;ine&s;s' now <Q>vi&s;ible among the people?</Q> I an&s;wer again in the negative. What is vi&s;ible is this, that &s;ome factious writers have endeavoured to create a 'general unea&s;ine&s;s among the people.' and have &s;pared no pains, and neglected no arts, that were likely to effect it. Some &s;uc|ce&s;s they have undoubtedly had, but in my opinion, far &s;hort of what is pretended. The late election in this, and a neighbour|ing province, has clearly evinced, that, in the &s;everal coun|ties where the matter was put to the trial, the majority of the people were free from the 'Unea&s;ine&s;s,' and 'very generally' expre&s;&s;ed their contempt of the low and infa|mous methods that were u&s;ed to deceive them. And I will venture to prophecy, that 'among all ranks of men, as they daily 'become more diffu&s;ively acquainted with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eality of the 'de&s;ign,' the more it will be approved. The Whig, I believe has &s;een his be&s;t days, people for a while, were diverted with the caperings and twi&s;ting of &s;uch a &s;caramouch, but the&s;e things will not always entertain.</P>
<P>The American Whig pretends, that among the lay-mem|bers of the church, there are not a few <Q>zealous opponents of an American epi&s;copate.</Q> Others can judge of this matter as well as he; and I appeal to every reader, whether he knows of many &s;uch per&s;ons. For my part I have never met with a &s;in|gle churchman, to my knowledge, or &s;o much as heard of one, who zealou&s;ly oppo&s;es, or has a di&s;po&s;ition to make any oppo&s;i|tion at all to American bi&s;hops, &s;ince the plan has been publick|ly explained; excepting always the Whig's friend, the Ameri|can churchman, who&s;e good manners, if he ever had any, have been mi&s;erably corrupted by evil communications. Now if by 'not a few' be meant a &s;ingle per&s;on, and if the American be in reality a churchman; then indeed it mu&s;t be allowed, that 'not a few' churchmen are <Q>zealous opponents of an American epi&s;copate.</Q></P>
<P>What he &s;ays of churchmen in Virginia, he offers with unu|&s;ual diffidence and mode&s;ty; from whence the con&s;equence is as clear as any in Euclid, that he is de&s;titute of evidence to &s;upport it. the people of Virginia are &s;o di&s;tant, that neither he nor I can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be competent judges of this matter. But Maryland is nearer; and both by per&s;ons and letters from thence, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the laity of that province are, in general, mo&s;t impatiently de&s;irous of an epi&s;copate&mdash;that they declare them&s;elves ready to join in a petition for that purpo&s;e&mdash;and willing to do every thing in their power in order to obtain it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="298" REF="010857_0150_0F851F081EDABE20">And I &s;ee not what &s;hould make any great difference between the people of Virginia and Maryland in this re&s;pect, unle&s;s the nature of the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate has not been &s;o well under|&s;tood and con&s;idered in the former of the&s;e Provinces. In a word I have yet met with no rea&s;ons for believing, that there is a churchman upon the continent, among the laity, who under|&s;tands the &s;ubject, that has any inclination to oppo&s;e the epi&s;co|pate in que&s;tion, (excepting as before excepted)&mdash;or, that there are any clergymen in America, who do not earne&s;tly de&s;ire it, excepting tho&s;e only who have rea&s;on to fear it.</P>
<P>After a &s;ly grin at the fate of the late &s;tamp-act, our Whig pecks at the foundation of the appeal: But it is in no danger from &s;uch efforts. The plan of an American pi&s;copate was formed by tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per bu&s;ine&s;s it was to form it. They well under&s;tood what they were doing, and needed not the in&s;truction of American Whigs. This being the ca&s;e, not 'the ba&s;is of the appeal,' but the ba&s;is of this attack, will <Q>be found to be chimerical and ab&s;urd.</Q></P>
<P>But <Q>is not all the power here contended for, in the hands of the clergy them&s;elves? Why is the civil government called upon to interpo&s;e?</Q> If this &s;agacious gentleman is unable to di&s;cover the true rea&s;on of this, I will inform him; and I de&s;ire him to remember, that the clergy of the church of England choo&s;e to have the approbation of the government in all their proceedings. They al&s;o think it their duty, not to proceed in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, before the nature of the mea&s;ure is explained, and application has been made to the higher pow|ers for their con&s;ent and patronage. They would choo&s;e al&s;o to have the approbation of all people, of every denomination, both at home and in the colonies; not forgetting the American Whigs. For this rea&s;on the plan has been freely &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the public, that all per&s;ons may &s;ee with their own eyes, that nothing is propo&s;ed or intended which can inter|fere with their intere&s;t or happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In return for this open, candid and generous conduct, the elergy have been mo&s;t illiberally &s;landered and abu&s;ed. They have been repre&s;ented as &s;o many public liars, furious bigots, and enemies to their country. In the very paper now before me, the elegant and polite author of it, charges them with <Q>unavowed eccle&s;ia&s;tical machinations,</Q> and more than in&s;inuates, <Q>that tho' the voice may be Jacob's voice, yet the hands are the hands of E&s;au</Q>&mdash;having thought fit, for rea&s;ons well known to him&s;elf, to drop his original metaphor of the Sheep and the Wolf.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Dr. Chandler, in his appeal to the publick, has been plea&s;ed not only to advance rea&s;ons in favour of &s;ending bi&s;hops to America, but al&s;o to plead the cau&s;e of epi&s;co|pacy it&s;elf; vainly declaring that he &s;hould look upon the &s;ilence of the di&s;&s;enters, with regard to his pamphlet, as a tacit con|&s;ent of the &s;trength of his arguments; I think it my duty to en|deavour by the channel of your paper, to convince the reader of the weakne&s;s of his rea&s;oning, and to prove that dioce&s;an epi&s;co|pacy is not of divine original, but merely of human invention.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute between the epi&s;copalians and pre&s;byterians is this. The epi&s;copalians a&s;&s;ert that there are different orders of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;uch as bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, &amp;c. the one &s;uperior
<PB N="300" REF="010857_0151_0F851E314C62CE90">in power and authority to the other; and that the right of or|daining mini&s;ters, is ve&s;ted &s;olely in the bi&s;hops: The pre&s;byte|rians, on the contrary affirm, that there ought to be a perfect equality between all the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and that the right of ordaining to the pa&s;toral office belongs to the pre&s;bytery, or a collective body of pre&s;byters. The&s;e are the rea&s;ons they advance in favour of their &s;entiments.</P>
<P N="1">1. One pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t epi&s;copacy, and in favour of pre&s;bytery, is this; that the fir&s;t reformers, when they re|jected the errors of popery, rejected with it epi&s;copacy, as an in|novation introduced into the church of Chri&s;t, and adopted pre&s;byteriani&s;m, or the doctrine of equality among&s;t mini&s;ters, as the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with go&s;pel purity and &s;implicity. Calvin in his in&s;titutions expre&s;ly declares, <HI>"caeterum quod epi&s;copos, et pre&s;byteres, &amp; pa&s;tores, &amp; mini&s;tros, promi&s;cue vocari qui eccle&s;ias regunt, id feci ex &s;cripturae u&s;u quae vocabula i&s;ta con|fundit."</HI> i. e. But the rea&s;on why I have promi&s;cuou&s;ly called tho&s;e who rule the church, bi&s;hops, and pre&s;byters, and mi|ni&s;ters, and pa&s;tors, is my following the cu&s;tom of &s;cripture, which confounds, or indi&s;criminately u&s;es tho&s;e words. Indeed had epi&s;copacy been of apo&s;tolic in&s;titution, and e&s;&s;ential to a proper con&s;titution of the church of Chri&s;t, there a thorough reformation of the church from the errors and corruptions of popery would have been morally impo&s;&s;ible, as the popi&s;h bi&s;hops were entirely oppo&s;ed to the fir&s;t reformers. And in as much as tho&s;e fir&s;t reformers were remarkable in&s;truments under Chri&s;t, in purging his church, as they enjoyed a large mea&s;ure of the &s;pirit of God, as they were very good and great men, and as they rejected epi&s;copacy, we may rationally pre&s;ume it was not of divine original.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t epi&s;copacy is this. Almo&s;t all the pre&s;ent churches, except that of England, di&s;|claim it; and even a great part of the Engli&s;h nation, and tho&s;e perhaps among the be&s;t Chri&s;tians in it, are oppos'd to it. The churches of Holland, Geneva and Scotland, the prote&s;tants in Germany and France, the di&s;&s;enters in England, Ireland and America, are all again&s;t it. Now if we compare the prote&s;tant epi&s;copalians and pre&s;byterians together, (I mean tho&s;e referred to above) we &s;hall find that the latter greatly exceed in number; and if we con&s;ider that there have been among&s;t the latter, men of as great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lities, knowledge, learning and virtue, as among&s;t the former, which, I think, cannot well be deny'd; we may rationally pre&s;ume again&s;t epi&s;copacy, as the majority of com|petent judges have voted again&s;t it. This argument will be
<PB N="301" REF="010857_0151_0F851E314C62CE90">&s;trengthened if we con&s;ider that the Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, tho&s;e &s;trenuous a&s;&s;erters of, and martyrs for the truth, di&s;avow|ed epi&s;copacy; whil&s;t the church of Rome at once over-run with error and vice, were the zealous patrons of it. Surely if the &s;e|cret of the Lord is with them that rear him, as the royal p&s;al|mi&s;t teaches; and if an exact conformity to the precepts of the church is the be&s;t method to obtain the knowledge of his doctrines, as our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour declares, and if we compare the character of the Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, with that of their adver&s;aries, we may rationally pre&s;ume that epi&s;copacy is not of divine original.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another pre&s;umptive rea&s;on again&s;t dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, is this. Although it is the form of church government in Eng|land, and although all the honours, riches and conveniencies of the pre&s;ent life, are on its &s;ide, yet there has been, and &s;till is, a va&s;t body of Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tian people, many of them the brighte&s;t lights in the nation, who could not in con&s;ci|ence con&s;ent to it. How many poor pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters are there not in the land, who&s;e &s;allaries are &s;o &s;mall that their fami|lies are in a &s;tarving condition, and who have it in their power to mend their circum&s;tances greatly by entering into the &s;ervice of the church of England, and yet they choo&s;e rather to grap|ple with all the perplexities and di&s;advantages of indigence than to do it. Now if we con&s;ider what a powerful motive an increa&s;|ed &s;alary is to a man in want, and who &s;ees his dear wife and children thereby expo&s;ed to innumerable dangers, difficulties and di&s;a&s;ters, we cannot avoid concluding, that nothing but the force of con&s;cience, and a &s;ecret conviction that epi&s;copacy is wrong, could prevent &s;uch per&s;ons, many of them confe&s;&s;edly men of good &s;en&s;e, and earne&s;tly de&s;irous to promote the wel|fare of their families, from &s;ub&s;cribing to it:</P>
<P N="4">4. Another pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t epi&s;copacy, is this, that it &s;eems not &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with the genius of the go&s;pel, and the humility it &s;o &s;trongly inculcates, as the &s;chem of an equality among&s;t mini&s;ters. As the &s;on of man came not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter, &s;o it ought to be with his am|ba&s;&s;adors; they &s;hould not de&s;ire to lord it over their brethren, but as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to the Romans, they &s;hould in honour pre|fer one another. As Chri&s;t their great lord and ma&s;ter wa&s;h'd the feet of his di&s;ciples, &s;o they &s;hould wa&s;h one another's feet, and chearfully &s;ubmit to the lowe&s;t offices of mutual kindne&s;s. But is not the epi&s;copal office incompatible with the exerci&s;e of the&s;e duties? Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord reproved the &s;ons of Zebedee for a&s;piring to a &s;uperiority over their brethren; and the beloved apo&s;tle complained of Diotrephes, who loved the preheminence.
<PB N="302" REF="010857_0152_0F851E31F3B63C48">How then could either have in&s;tituted epi&s;copacy which counte|nances &s;uch a &s;uperiority and preheminence? It was a remarka|ble &s;aying of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he frequently repeat|ed, <HI>every one that exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, but he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted.</HI> His continual advice to his followers was, <HI>learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</HI> He told his apo&s;tles, that tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of being the greate&s;t in his kingdom, &s;hould become the lea&s;t, and &s;ervants of all. Now I leave it to any candid judge to determine, what form of church government is mo&s;t agreeable to the&s;e maxims, and the genius of the go&s;pel, the epi&s;copal or the presbyterian? Surely there is &s;omething in them that doth not well harmonize with the former, but is very con&s;i&s;tent with the latter. What language &s;ounds mo&s;t avangelical, &s;uch as an inferior clergyman would u&s;e to a bi&s;hop, or &s;uch as a presbyterian would u&s;e to a presbyter? Surely the latter. Nay I am apt to think, that the names and titles a&s;cribed to bi&s;hops are highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and di&s;agreeable in the ears of every pious prelate. The arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury is &s;tiled, his grace, the arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury, metropolitan, primate of all England. The bi&s;h|op of London, is called the right reverend father in God, the lord bi&s;hop of London, &amp;c. How contrary is the giving and a&s;&s;uming &s;uch &s;ounding and lofty titles to the genius of the go&s;|pel, nay to the po&s;itive declarations of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? It was an expre&s;s commandment of this great head of the church, <HI>call no man ma&s;ter, for one is your ma&s;ter who is in Heaven; call no man father, for one is your father even God.</HI> It is not impious for a man to a&s;&s;ume the name of lord, when his great matter was di&s;tingui&s;hed by that title?</P>
<P N="5">5. A farther pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t epi&s;copacy, is this. It is more apt to &s;well proud ambition, and promote its danger|ous and horrid effects, than pre&s;bytery; moderate revenues and common privileges will never engage haughty a&s;piring minds in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, but a &s;welling title and a large revenue will; and epi&s;copacy naturally verges to high titles and great &s;alaries. Thus the hierachy has made men aim at holy orders for the &s;ake of honour and riches, who never would have done it for the glory of God and the good of &s;ouls. But how is this con&s;i&s;tent with going forth unto Chri&s;t without the camp, bearing his re|proach? How is it compatible with denying our&s;elves, taking up our cro&s;s and following our great ma&s;ter? How is it learning to endure hardne&s;s like good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? The hiera|chy has been the cau&s;e of very great luxury and prodigality in the church of Rome, and in &s;ome prote&s;tant churches; to wit, &s;uperb palaces, large reveaues, grand and magnificent ca|thedrals,
<PB N="303" REF="010857_0152_0F851E31F3B63C48">and much external pomp and &s;plendour; nay, I dare affirm, that if there had not been a di&s;tinction of orders among the clergy, and if one order had not been greatly exalted above another, there never would have been &s;uch &s;piritual tyranny in the church of Chri&s;t, and &s;uch per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion, as the annals of pa&s;t ages, and our own experience acquaint us with: There probably never would have been popes, patriarchs, cardi|nals, and &s;uch like domineering eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, if there never had been dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. Therefore from the&s;e, and many other bad effects which have flowed from epi&s;copacy, and to which pre&s;byterian government would have been an antidote, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that the former is incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity and pro&s;perity of the church of Chri&s;t, with which the other is entirely con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t dioce&s;an epi&s;copa|cy, and in favour of presbyterian church government is, that the latter (all things con&s;idered) is more likely to promote the welfare of the church of Chri&s;t than the former. One man is more likely to be impo&s;ed upon, to mi&s;take and to act wrong in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs than a great number. Tho&s;e very rea&s;ons which rendered it expedient in the apo&s;tles time, that they &s;hould be con&s;ulted about the ordination of mini&s;ters, on account of their &s;upernatural abilities to di&s;tingui&s;h the qualifications of the candidate; tho&s;e very rea&s;ons, now extraordinary gifts have cea&s;ed, render it proper that a pre&s;bytery &s;hould have the power of ordination, and not a bi&s;hop; for &s;uppo&s;ing them all men of equal goodne&s;s and abilities, &s;urely the deci&s;ion of the whole bo|dy will be more ju&s;t and con&s;i&s;tent than tho&s;e of one man, and this is entirely agreeable to the maxims of the wi&s;e king, that in the multitude of coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety. One man, though never &s;o hone&s;t, may &s;ooner be deceived than a great many, and thus be the in&s;trument of introducing a wicked and unworthy candidate in the mini&s;try. A &s;ingle man may &s;ooner be bribed or corrupted to lay on hands &s;uddenly than &s;everal. Be&s;ides, if a bi&s;hop he as wicked a man as a pre&s;byter, the former will be a much greater detriment to the church than the latter; for one wicked bi&s;hop may do much greater injury to religion than &s;eve|ral wicked pre&s;byters; tho&s;e of the latter order will be mutual checks upon each other's ambition and wrong mea&s;ures, but the former being free from all re&s;traint, is at liberty to put in prac|tice the wilde&s;t &s;chemes. To this we may add, that under bi&s;h|ops, corruptions in religion may more ea&s;ily be propagated than under pre&s;byters. A bi&s;hop may &s;catter his poi&s;on through a whole dioce&s;s, whil&s;t a pre&s;byter may be re&s;trained by his bre|thren in a &s;ingle congregation.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="304" REF="010857_0153_0F851E329C024DA8">
7. Another pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, and in favour of congregational bi&s;hops or pre&s;byters, is this. It is impo&s;&s;ible that one man can &s;o properly govern and &s;uper|intend a whole dioce&s;s as a great many. A faithful mini&s;ter finds it hard and difficult enough to take care of the &s;ouls of a &s;ingle pari&s;h, how then could he take care of the &s;ouls of many pari&s;h|es? and therefore we read in &s;cripture of no other ordinary rela|tion, re&s;pecting a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, than that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and a particular flock committed more e&s;pecially to his care. As to the apo&s;tles, they were eye-witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;tis re&s;urrection, extraordinary officers endowed with the power of working miracles, and divinely in&s;pired, and therefore they could have no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to their peculiar office; and, till modern bi&s;h|ops can prove their &s;uperiority over their brethren by miracles, and a divine in&s;piration, they mu&s;t excu&s;e us from acknowledging the rea&s;onablene&s;s and divine appointment of &s;uch &s;uperiority. As to the evangeli&s;ts, their mini&s;try was not indeed confined to a &s;ingle congregation, yet there was nothing peculiar to their office which could not be performed by a common pre&s;byter. In &s;hort, a careful over&s;ight of the flock of Chri&s;t, a particular in|&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on into their manners and conduct, the in&s;truction of the ri&s;ing generation, preaching the word continually, admini&s;|tering the &s;acraments, and a due attendance upon his people in &s;ickne&s;s and &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;s, is the duty of every &s;ettled mi|ni&s;ter of the go&s;pel. But how can one bi&s;hop perform all this with regard to a whole dioce&s;s? therefore, it is probable, that dioce&s;an bi&s;hops were not of divine in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another very &s;trong and pre&s;umptive argument again&s;t dio|ce&s;an epi&s;copacy, is this. That &s;everal bi&s;hops and learned clergymen of the church of England, have them&s;elves di&s;avow|ed the divine in&s;titution of it. In the year 1537 or 1538, Tho|mas Cromwell, vicar general, the two arch-bi&s;hops, eleven bi&s;hops, and many other doctors and civilians, &s;ub&s;cribed a de|claration, which clo&s;es with the&s;e remarkable words. That <Q>though the fathers of the church had in&s;tituted other inferior orders and degrees, as Janitors, Lectors, &amp;c. yet the truth is, that in the New Te&s;tament there is no mention made of any de|grees or di&s;tinction in orders, but only of deacons or mini&s;ters, and of prie&s;ts or bi&s;hops.</Q> <HI>Arch-bi&s;hop Whitgift</HI> thought no particular form of church government of divine right. Bi&s;hop Morton in his Catholic apology, tells the papi&s;ts, that the power of order and juri&s;diction which they a&s;cribed to bi&s;hops, doth <HI>de jure divino</HI> belong to all other pre&s;byters, and particularly that to ordain is their ancient right. Bi&s;hop Jewel, in a certain pa&s;|&s;age does not merely cen&s;ure one Harding for condemning the
<PB N="305" REF="010857_0153_0F851E329C024DA8">doctrine of the parity of bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters as heretical, but plainly &s;uppo&s;es that opinion, to be both agreeable to &s;cripture and to the doctrine of St. Jerom, St. Au&s;tin, and St. Ambro&s;e; and he cites with approbation, the&s;e known and remarkable words of Jerom, 'let bi&s;hops know that they are in authority over prie&s;ts, more by cu&s;tom than by order of God's truth.' In the reign of Henry VIII. we are told by Dr. Stillingfleet, in his Irinecum, part 2. chap. viii. p. 386. There was a &s;elect a&s;&s;embly called by the king's &s;pecial order, at Windfor ca&s;tle, where met the&s;e following per&s;ons: Thomas, arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury, Edward, arch-bi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Ro|che&s;ter, Edmund, bi&s;hop of London, Robert, bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, Dr. George Day, Thomas Robert&s;on, Dr. Redmain, Dr. Edward Leighton, Dr. Simon Mathew, Dr. William Tre&s;ham, Dr. Rie Cozen, Dr. Edgworth, Dr. Owen Oglethorp and Dr. Thyrlby; and among other que&s;tions propo&s;ed to them, to which they &s;everally gave in their an&s;wers; the tenth que&s;tion was, whether bi&s;hops or prie&s;ts were fir&s;t? And if the prie&s;ts were fir&s;t, then the prie&s;t made the bi&s;hop? To this que&s;tion arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer's an&s;wer was in the&s;e words: The bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts were at one time, and were not two things, but one office in the beginning of Chri&s;t's religion. And we are told by the &s;ame author, that the bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Thyrlby and Cox, were all of the &s;ame opinion with the arch-bi&s;hop, that at fir&s;t bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts were the &s;ame. Thus, &s;aith he, we &s;ee by the te&s;timony chiefly of him who was in&s;trumental in our reformation, that he owned not opi&s;copacy as a di&s;tinct order from pre&s;bytery of divine right, but only as a prudent con&s;titution of the civil magi&s;trate for the better governing in the church. I might pro|duce pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, out of Dr. Reignolds, Dr. Hammond and others, but the limits pre&s;crib'd by the printer, would not admit of &s;uch an enlargement. I &s;hall conclude this argument with ob&s;erving, according to Dr. Stillingfleet, that King James, Dr. Co&s;ins, Dr. Low, Bi&s;hop Bridges, Dr. Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tcliff and Dr. Crackanthorp, were of opinion, that no form of church government is by the &s;criptures pre&s;cribed to, or com|manded the church of God. Upon a review of all the above arguments, and a con&s;ideration of their united force; I think every rational, unprejudiced man, will be ready to conclude, that it is not, upon the whole probable that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy was of divine original, or that it was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t or his apo&s;|tles. And now, having premi&s;ed the&s;e pre&s;umptive arguments, I will boldly defy all the divines and learned men in the world, to produce a &s;ingle, po&s;itive or probable argument to the contra|ry from any part of the Bible, the only religion of prote&s;tants (as Mr. Chillingworth ju&s;tly ob&s;erves.)</P>

<P>MY title now fir&s;t appears inadequate, for the 7th No. of the Whip; the former part of it, e&s;pecially, is &s;o &s;ingu|larly malicious, that the writer certainly de&s;erves &s;ome|thing more than a Kick; the reader will therefore excu&s;e, me, if on this occa&s;ion, I act for once a little out of character, in treat|ing &s;eriou&s;ly one, who perhaps has it in his power to do mi&s;chief, as a per&s;on (for that rea&s;on only) of &s;ome importance. Barely to laugh at a felon, wou'd be highly incongruous, and only to ri|dicule as a &s;impleton, a man who ought to be &s;tigmatiz'd as a vil|lain, wou'd be inexcu&s;ably criminal.</P>
<P>As Squire T. begs all candid readers 'to reflect, whether &s;uch publications as the Whig's 5th No. have not a direct ten|dency to rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies in the mother country, again&s;t the colonies,' I beg leave to appeal to the &s;ame impartial judges, whether &s;uch publications as his 7th No. have not a &s;till more direct tendency, to increa&s;e and confirm &s;uch &s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies? If the Whig has been imprudent, is not the Whipper evidently malevolent? If the Whig has driven a nail, has not Squire T. done all he cou'd to clench it? If the Whig has inadvertently kindled a fire, has not his flagellator indu&s;triou&s;ly blown the coals? If the Whig has merited a Whip, does not the Whipper him&s;elf richly de&s;erve a &s;corpion? Nay, did he not write No. 7. (I dare appeal to his own con&s;cience) &s;timulated by the de&s;ign, and ani|mated by the hopes, of incen&s;ing the government at home, a|gain&s;t the non-conformi&s;ts in America? If any one doubts, let him but impartially read over the five fir&s;t paragraphs, and he mu&s;t needs be convinced, and give his opinion in my favour. What but the rage of con&s;cious guilt, and con&s;equent malevo|lence to its detectors, cou'd have in&s;tigated Squire T. to accu&s;e the &s;action (as he affects to call them) of hopes and de&s;igns ne|ver conceiv'd;&mdash;principles, mo&s;t maliciously repre&s;ented as di&s;loyal and de&s;tructive, both to the being and authority of Kings, but never 'til of late con&s;ider'd as &s;uch by any but Jacobites, &s;ince the reign of William the third.&mdash;Endeavours to taint the minds of the people, and debauch their affections to the mo|ther

Strange! that a writer, who &s;o &s;everely condemns the Whig, &s;hou'd be &s;o much more guilty him&s;elf, and, after whipping others for their dirtine&s;s, like Smedley in the Dunciad, dive &s;o much deeper than the re&s;t in the mud!&mdash;Strange did I &s;ay? No; <HI>per fas et ne&s;as</HI> is his motto, and as he has darling purpo&s;es to an&s;wer, <HI>recte &s;i po&s;&s;is, &s;i non, quocunque modo rem|&s;acias</HI> will &s;ufficiently account for his conduct.

The advocates for pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance (which Whippers and Hang men are accu&s;|tomed to) are not apt to be fond of a limited monarchy, as be|ing unfriendly to their own ambitious aims and de&s;potic princi|ples.</P>
<P>Having with all the virulence of malice, thunder'd out many bitter invectives again&s;t the Whig, &amp;c. in his five fir&s;t para|graphs, in the 6th Squire T. trumpets his own prai&s;es mo&s;t de|lightfully: I, is the little hero of the tale. He &s;eems to have determined to make repri&s;als, and dre&s;s him&s;elf as decently as po&s;&s;ible, at the expence of the faction; nay, who knows but he hopes to get a pair of lawn &s;leeves, made out of the rags of their reputation?</P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL. July 14 The CENTINEL. [No. XVII.]</HEAD>
<P>DR. Chandler, in the name of his brethren, adduces the wretched condition of the epi&s;copal church in the colo|nies, for want of regular government and di&s;cipline without bi&s;hops, as an argument for their introduction. He e&s;teems it a great grievance, and unparrelled hard&s;hip, and a di&s;advantage of greater con&s;equence than the want of confirma|tion; although he imagines that by that rite, the gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the holy Spirit are communicated.</P>
<P>Wretched indeed is the condition of that church, which is de&s;titute of regular di&s;cipline: But there is ground to &s;u&s;pect that the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries in America are no more affected with this con&s;ideration, than their brethren on the other &s;ide of the atlantic, who are in the &s;ame wretched condition, yet make no attempts to get the grievance redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The reformation of their church in this article, is not among the happy con&s;equences, which they can expect from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of bi&s;hops in this country. The argument is only thrown out to work on the ignorant, and to excite compa&s;&s;ion among well minded per&s;ons, for their &s;uffering, per&s;ecuted church; which their apologi&s;t, Dr. Chandler, artfully repre|&s;ents as 'peri&s;hing for want of nece&s;&s;aries' The mi&s;&s;ionaries mu&s;t allow, there is no nece&s;&s;ary connection between the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops in a church, and the admini&s;tra|tion of Godly di&s;cipline: That there may be di&s;cipline in a church, where there are no prelates: And that there may be bi&s;hops in a communion, de&s;titute even of the &s;hadow of regular di&s;cipline. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, they &s;ee other churches around them without bi&s;hops, exerci&s;ing di&s;cipline over their own members; and they know that the church of England in the mid&s;t of all their uncharitable preten&s;ions to be the only true apo&s;tolic church, the propagators of the true religion, the be&s;t reformed church in the world, the pre&s;ervers of the true Chri&s;tian faith, wor&s;hip, and di&s;cipline, is &s;olemnly confe&s;&s;ing to God from year to year, that they are de&s;titute of a godly di&s;cipline,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commination before Lent.</NOTE> although they are aided by a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, and &s;upported by the authority, grandeur and opulence of prelates and other dignitaries.</P>

That this is truly the &s;ituation of the church of England, has been often acknowledged by her mo&s;t judicious and candid members. They ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that there is a great pro|&s;tration of di&s;cipline in their church: That it is ruined among them:&mdash;That the di&s;temper of the times is evidently too hard for it:&mdash;That the di&s;cipline of the church has not been car|ried to any degree of perfection; and now lies under a general relaxation:&mdash;That their people are often indulged in all their unrea&s;onable demands, and di&s;orderly ways, to prevent their executing their threats of going to the meeting &mdash;That they have only the form and &s;hadow of di&s;cipline, but tru&s;t in God, that 'the&s;e dry bones will one day live.'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>White</HI>'s Letters to a Di&s;&s;ent.

A di&s;po&s;ition to &s;light the highe&s;t puni&s;hment which the church can inflict has become general, and there appears no remedy, but in the u&s;e of rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion. But we live in an age in which rea&s;on will not be heard, nor the &s;trength of arguments regarded, although &s;upported by the declarations of Heaven, on the &s;ubject of church di&s;cipline.'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal,</HI> 31.</NOTE> The Doctor and his brethren know that the te&s;t has broken down all the inclo&s;ures of the church of England, and has laid open her mo&s;t holy things to the mo&s;t abandoned and profane. Rakes, debauchees, bla&s;|phemers of God, infidels and &s;coffers at all religion, are often &s;een on their knees at her communion tables, eating her chil|dren's bread to qualify them for a po&s;t: And dare the clergy re|fu&s;e them? No; they dare not refu&s;e the mo&s;t impious bla&s;phe|mer the three kingdoms afford, when he comes to demand the Lord's Supper, as a qualification for a po&s;t in the fleet or army.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o notorious that the Engli&s;h bi&s;hop him&s;elf is excluded from having any power even in his own court; where a chancellor, generally a lay-man, &s;its &s;upreme and uncontrouled by the bi&s;hop, and finally determines who &s;hall be excommunicated from, or received into Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip. If there be any thing, &s;ays a great prelate of the church of England, in the office of a bi&s;hop to be challenged peculiar to them&s;elves, certainly it &s;hould be this; yet it is in a manner quite relinqui&s;hed to their chan|cellors,

<P>Such is the melancholy &s;ituation of the church of England with re&s;pect to her di&s;cipline, even in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment by law, and &s;upported by all the &s;plendor and influ|ence of lordly prelates and dignified prie&s;ts. Yet it is &s;aid the epi&s;copal church in the colonies &s;uffers unparallelled hard&s;hips, for want of regular di&s;cipline, becau&s;e &s;he is de&s;titute of bi&s;hops. But can the mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;eriou&s;ly believe this grievance would be removed by the introduction of bi&s;hops? No &s;uch matter. They declare, by Dr. Chandler, that no reformation in this re&s;pect will be attempted: that the di&s;cipline of the church, as far as it relates to the private members, will be left it is, under the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal,</HI> 26, 31, 95.</NOTE> Di&s;cipline was not the thing they had in view, when they petitioned for bi&s;hops to be &s;et over them. They are meerly to unite, govern, &s;upport and defend the clergy. More &s;olicitous for the honour of an u&s;ele&s;s eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperior to cut a figure at their head, than to edify their people by re&s;toring the primitive di&s;cipline of the church; they propo&s;e a mutilated prelate, &s;uch as never yet appeared in the churches of Chri&s;t. It would &s;eem that when the&s;e gentle|men took a trip to England in their youth for orders, they were captivated with the magnificence of the epi&s;copal palaces, the

<P>Why then are the&s;e pitiful lamentations made over the want of di&s;cipline in the epi&s;copal church in America, and con&s;idera|tions drawn from it to induce their &s;uperiors at home to &s;end over bi&s;hops, to re&s;cue their &s;inking church from inevitable perdition. Let us &s;ee how prettily the argument will conclude, when re|duced to a logical form. The church in America, without re&s;i|dent bi&s;hops, is nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of a regular di&s;cipline and government: 'But the di&s;cipline of the church, as far as it re|lates to private members will be left as it is, and no attempts of this nature will be made under the propo&s;ed American epi&s;co|pate.' Therefore an American epi&s;copate is nece&s;&s;ary for the re|&s;toration of primitive di&s;cipline of the church. One not &s;o well acquainted with the rules of logic, as Dr. C. is, would have been apt to &s;u&s;pect that the conclu&s;ion &s;hould have been, that it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary for the regular government of the church, as it would contribute nothing to the redre&s;s of this 'intolerable and unprecedented hard&s;hip.' Yet notwith&s;tand|ing the ob&s;tinacy of the premi&s;es, the doctor it &s;eems was not willing to lo&s;e the wi&s;hed for conclu&s;ion, nor the opportunity of di&s;playing his talents in painting his church in &s;uch doleful co|lours. In making &s;uch bitter lamentations over her want of di&s;|cipline, he &s;eems to have con&s;ulted poorly for her reputation, and as wretchedly for the credit of her clergy, in avowing to the world, that no amendment is propo&s;ed in point of di&s;cipline, ex|cept as to the clergy, the laity being profe&s;&s;edly left out of the plan.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal,</HI> 97.</NOTE> This being the ca&s;e, it is expected that Dr. Chandler, or the next apologi&s;t for his church, will &s;often the&s;e mournful com|plaints, and for their own &s;akes prepare a more favourable account of the &s;tate of di&s;cipline in their congregations, and of the di&s;po&s;ition of the clergy to reform it: Otherwi&s;e the world will &s;carce believe their church to be the be&s;t reformed church in the world; the pure&s;t church under Heaven; the bulwark of the reformation; the pure apo&s;tolic church; and the <HI>church,</HI> by way of eminence and exclu&s;ion, as if there was no other in the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>By this time, it mu&s;t appear pretty plain, that the argument taken from the pro&s;tration of di&s;cipline in the epi&s;copal churches in America, is meerly a delu&s;ive piece of declamation, no ways connected with the &s;cheme of an American epi&s;copate. Nay,
<PB N="313" REF="010857_0157_0F851E3B71A22570">bi&s;hops would rather tye up the hands of the clergy, and pre|vent any thing being done of this &s;ort, if we may judge from what pa&s;&s;es in England. Had it not been for civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, what could have prevented the reformation of many abu&s;es in the church of England, which every good member &s;ees with re|gret? Dr. Chandler, imputes it to the want of good &s;en&s;e and candour enough in the body of the nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Appeal,</HI> 96.</NOTE> But in this en|lightened age, e&s;pecially as the things which call for amendment have been held up to public view, for more than a century pa&s;t, by &s;ome of the greate&s;t men of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, as well as others, in a very &s;triking point of light; this cannot be the ca&s;e. The root of the evil lies deeper, and mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment; by which even the mo&s;t di&s;tant hopes of re|formation in any thing material, are cut off. e&s;tabli&s;hments in religion may make hypocrites and occa&s;ional conformi&s;ts, when their &s;eculiar intere&s;ts lead them that way; but never do great &s;ervice to true Chri&s;tianity. This needs not the chains of earthly grandeur, nor the force of civil power to &s;pread and e&s;tabli&s;h it. High dignities and preferments; mitres and thrones; lord&s;hips and princely revenues have ever been injurious to its intere&s;ts; and in&s;tead of improving, have dreadfully corrupted, and de|praved the religion of Je&s;us, and robb'd it of its native glory and &s;trength. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory in all ages lamentably bears witne&s;s to the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e remarks; yet the want of the&s;e things is now made an excu&s;e for &s;uffering di&s;cipline in the epi&s;co|pal church to remain relaxed and pro&s;trate.</P>
<P>What can the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters in the colonies have to &s;ay in excu&s;e for them&s;elves, if they criminally neglect re&s;toring primi|tive di&s;cipline? Dr. C. confe&s;&s;es that pre&s;byters may have a &s;ub|ordinate power to govern the church, and enjoy a right to exclude from the Sacraments all publickly vicious members. In this country they are un-re&s;trained by the difficulties which em|barra&s;s the con&s;cientious pari&s;h mini&s;ters in England, their enclo|&s;ures are not laid open by a political te&s;t; and they enjoy every power which other churches in the colonies have. Why then &s;hould they de&s;pair of accompli&s;hing what is daily done by o|thers? They profe&s;s to wi&s;h for it; why do they not attempt it by rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion, the only rational way in which it can be brought about? no di&s;cipline was more &s;evere than that of the primitive church; yet it was all voluntary, and received no countenance from civil power.</P>
<P>But in truth, the&s;e people are, them&s;elves, little affected with the pathetic complaints, they make for want of a regular di&s;ci|pline.
<PB N="314" REF="010857_0158_0F851E3C43220080">The&s;e are thrown out meerly to excite the public pity, and to &s;kroen them&s;elves from the charge of &s;upine negligence, in not attempting to re&s;tore it; under an idle pretence that they want bi&s;hops to effect it for them. Yet at the &s;ame time they are &s;o weak and incon&s;i&s;tent, as to declare that no attempts to re|&s;tore di&s;cipline, will be made under the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> AMERICAN WHIG. [Numb. XIX.]</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO I have advanced only pre&s;umptive arguments, I &s;hall now produce po&s;itive proofs from the New Te&s;ta|ment again&s;t dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, or the doctrine of the &s;uperiority of bi&s;hops to pre&s;byters, with regard to ordination, confirmation and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. If there had been one in&s;tance in the &s;acred &s;cripture of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, ordained to his office, by the impo&s;ition of a bi&s;hop; how great|ly would the epi&s;copalians have triumphed in &s;uch a ca&s;e? I think therefore, as there is an in&s;tance of a proper ordination to the mini&s;terial office, recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, which is &s;aid to have been done by the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery, the point ought to be given up; and it ought to be candidly acknowledged that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy is not of divine original; and that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a glaring evidence, which ought to put an end to the di&s;pute, any learned and &s;en|&s;ible man &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in the contrary &s;entiment, is as &s;trong and as melancholly a proof of the force of prejudice, and the unwillingne&s;s of mankind, to give up old opinions, as can well be imagined.</P>
<P>Timothy was ordained by the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery. This is evident from St. Paul's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to him. See the 4th chapter 14 ver&s;e. <HI>Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by prophe&s;y, with the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery.</HI> As this text is &s;o &s;trongly in fa|vour of pre&s;byterian, and &s;o contrary to epi&s;copal ordination, the patrons of the latter have exerci&s;ed their utmo&s;t ability to evade the argument that ari&s;es from it. I will mention, and reply to all the eva&s;ions that have been invented by ingenious men to ob|&s;cure and invalidate our argument from this pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred
<PB N="315" REF="010857_0158_0F851E3C43220080">writ; and I doubt not but I &s;hall make it &s;ufficiently appear, that this text, notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid to the con|trary, is a full demon&s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the validity of pre&s;byterian or|dination, a demon&s;tration infinitely better de&s;erving the name, than that of Chilling worth, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed and ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iled by Dr. Chandler.

<P>The fir&s;t eva&s;ion I &s;hall mention, is this; the epi&s;copalians pretend that the word <HI>gift</HI> ought to be connected with the words, <HI>of the pre&s;bytery,</HI> and then they would read the ver&s;e thus, neg|lect not the gift of pre&s;bytery, &amp;c. It is ju&s;tly objected to this arrangement of the words, that it is evidently contrary to the rules of Grammer, as may be &s;een by looking on the arrange|ment of the original words. Be&s;ides the original word pre&s;by|terian, here rendered pre&s;bytery, occurs but in two more pa&s;&s;a|ges in the New-Te&s;tament; namely, Luke xxii. 66. and Acts v. 22. and in both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages it &s;ignifies an a&s;&s;embly of elders, and not the mini&s;terial office. I &s;hall take no farther notice of this eva&s;ion, as it mu&s;t be evident to any per&s;on acquainted with the Greek language, that there is not the lea&s;t foundation for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another eva&s;ion of the epi&s;copalians, is this; they &s;ay, by the pre&s;bytery we mu&s;t under&s;tand the apo&s;tles. If this &s;hould be admitted, it would not prove that the right of ordination be|longs to a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, becau&s;e if an apo&s;tle has this right, it is no proof that a bi&s;hop, not endowed with extraordinary a|bilities, and miraculous endowments, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, much le&s;s can it be argued that a &s;ingle bi&s;hop may ordain becau&s;e a number of apo&s;tles did. If all the apo&s;tle, joined together in ordaining Timothy, their example would be more conformable to the pre&s;byterian method of ordination than the epi&s;copal. However, I ab&s;olutely deny that pre&s;bytery means the college of apo&s;tles. I think it would not be much more ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the apo&s;tles were the &s;anhedrim, than to &s;uppo&s;e them the pre&s;bytery here &s;poken of; the apo&s;tles are no where called in the New-Te&s;tament the pre&s;bytery. They are &s;tiled the Eleven, the Twelve, the Apo&s;tles, &amp;c. as may be &s;een in many pa&s;&s;ages. Compare John xxi. 1. and xx. 18. with acts i. 2.15. and acts vi. 2, 26. In the two la&s;t pa&s;&s;ages we read, that the apo&s;tles cho&s;e by lot a &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the room of Judas, and of their lay|ing their hands on the &s;even deacons; and undoubtedly if they had laid their hands on Timothy at his ordination. Paul would have mentioned it, and &s;aid, with the laying on of the hands of the apo&s;tles, and not the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another eva&s;ion, is this; that though the pre&s;bytery laid
<PB N="316" REF="010857_0159_0F851E3CE334A260">hands upon Timothy at his ordination, yet what con&s;tituted the walidity of it, was the laying on of Paul's hands: This is Dr. Chandler's plea. To this it is an&s;wered, that the text &s;peaks of the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery, and not the laying on of Paul's hands. If Paul had laid his hands on Timothy, at his ordination here referred to, it is probable he would have &s;aid, with the laying on of my hands and the hands of the pre&s;|bytery; but as there is no mention made of the impo&s;ition of Paul's hands in this text, it is certain it cannot be in&s;erred from it. However, if Paul &s;hould have joined with the pre&s;bytery in &s;etting Timothy apart to the mini&s;try, and this pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be allowed to refer to that matter, it would only follow, that he acted in this affair &s;o far as is related &s;imply to the ordination, as a fellow pre&s;byter, and not as an apo&s;tle.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another, and the mo&s;t material eva&s;ion, is this; That the gift here referred to, is not the office of the mini&s;try, but the gift of the Holy-Gho&s;t. This is urged by bi&s;hop Hoadly, who alledges, that it is very &s;trange that the office of the mini&s;try &s;hould be called a gift. But how &s;urpri&s;ingly weak and mean is &s;uch a &s;ubterfuge in &s;o great a ma&s;ter of rea&s;oning, and a man of &s;uch candor as this eminent bi&s;hop undoubtedly was? It proves that this text hangs like a heavy mill&s;tone about the neck of epi&s;copal ordination, &s;ince &s;uch ab&s;urd methods are u&s;ed to get rid of it; and if &s;uch a champion as bi&s;hop Hoadly could not remove it, we may pre&s;ume that no other patron of epi&s;co|pacy ever will. We no where read in &s;cripture that the Holy-Gho&s;t was confered by the impo&s;ition of the hands of the pre&s;by|tery; I mean, a company of ordinary pre&s;byters; and no one would have dreamt of &s;uch a thing, if it had not been to &s;erve the ends of a proud and lucrative hierachy: Be&s;ides, there was no need for the pre&s;bytery to lay hands on Timothy to confer the Holy-Gho&s;t, the apo&s;tle could do it alone; nay, a&s;&s;erts he had done it. 2 Timothy i. 6. In as much then, as the pre&s;by|tery laid their hands on Timothy, and as they did not do it to confer the Holy-Gho&s;t, which Paul could do; nay, declares he had done, we &s;hall make bold to conclude it was to ordain him to the mini&s;try, except our opponents are capable of a&s;&s;igning a better rea&s;on for this ceremony.</P>
<P>To affirm that St. Paul laid his haads on Timothy on the occa&s;ion referred to in the text, is to build without a foundation; the apo&s;tle declaring no &s;uch thing in this pa&s;&s;age, and it being utterly impo&s;&s;ible that this pa&s;&s;age, and 2 Timothy i. 6. relate to the &s;ame thing, for the following rea&s;ons; If they did, the manner of expre&s;&s;ion in both, would not be &s;o different as it is. Moreover the context in the 1 Tim. iv. 14. &s;uits be&s;t with the
<PB N="317" REF="010857_0159_0F851E3CE334A260">opinion of Timothy's ordination to the mini&s;terial office, as any one will be &s;en&s;ible of, if he reads it with impartiallity. Be&s;ides, if b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e above mentioned pa&s;&s;ages relate to the &s;ame thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> apo&s;tle is guilty of tautology, which is unlikely. Fur|ther it is rea&s;onable to think, that &s;o great a ma&s;ter of addre&s;s as the Apo&s;tle Paul, in an epi&s;tle to a young mini&s;ter, wherein he expre&s;ly exhorts him to a faithful di&s;charge of the mini&s;terial office, would enforce his exhortation by reminding that mini&s;ter of the &s;olemn occa&s;ion, when he was &s;et apart for that office, and entered into the &s;tricte&s;t engagements duly to perform it; but if it is not done here, it is done no where el&s;e in the epi&s;tles. At lea&s;t if Paul &s;peaks twice of a gift given to Timothy, it is very rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that in one ca&s;e he refers to the mi|ni&s;terial office; and &s;ince it is acknowledged on all hands, that the pre&s;bytery laid hands on candidates to ordain them to the mini&s;try, and the apo&s;tles after laid their hands on per&s;ons to confer the Holy-Gho&s;t; and &s;ince there is not one plain in&s;tance in &s;cripture of common pre&s;byters conjointly conferring the Holy-Gho&s;t by the impo&s;ition of hands, or any other way, it undeni|ably follows, that Timothy was ordained by the pre&s;bytery.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that a man of bi&s;hop Hoadly's learning &s;hould pretend, that the apo&s;tle did not de&s;ign the mini&s;terial office in the above pa&s;&s;ages, becau&s;e he calls it a gift. Did he not know that offices were gifts, that the Greek word <HI>chari&s;ma,</HI> munus, &s;ignifies an office; Did he not recollect &s;cripture in&s;tances where the mini&s;terial office is repre&s;ented as a gift? Did he not remem|ber Ephe&s;. iv. 11. where the apo&s;tle tells us, that Chri&s;t gave &s;ome apo&s;tles, and &s;ome prophets, and &s;ome evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome pa&s;tors and teachers? Did he not remember Rom. xii. 6, 7, 8. Having then gifts <HI>chari&s;mata,</HI> offices differing according to the grace that is is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy, according to the proportion of &s;aith; or mini&s;try, let us wait on our mini&s;try, &amp;c. did he not know? Did he not recollect the&s;e particulars? Undoubtedly he did. But what could he do? He had undertaken the defence of epi&s;copal ordina|tion, and this text was directly contrary to it. He was therefore obliged to wre&s;t the &s;criptures. In &s;hort, his glo&s;&s;es on this text to evade the evidence ari&s;ing from it in favour of pre&s;byterian ordination, have convinced me more fully, that it is a deci&s;ive argument, with regard to the point in debate. Before I con|clude my ob&s;ervations on this text, I &s;hall take notice of another objection, which bi&s;hop Hoadly urges again&s;t the u&s;e we make of it; he &s;ays, <Q>if this text proves any thing in favour of &s;uch a right. <HI>i. e.</HI> the right of pre&s;byters to ordain.</Q> It equally proves that pre&s;byters had a right to &s;et apart, not only pre&s;by|ters
<PB N="318" REF="010857_0160_0F851E3DA163BAC0">to their office, but even evangeli&s;ts, or church officers as Timothy was, to their office, which is ab&s;urd, But it is no ab|&s;urdity for a number of inferiors to &s;et apart others to a &s;uperior office: It is what is done continually, and church hi&s;tory fur|ni&s;hes us with in&s;tances of this nature, directly to the purpo&s;e; which the bi&s;hop was well acquainted with: But to &s;ay, that an evangeli&s;t, or that Timothy, was an officer &s;uperior to a pre&s;byter, is begging the que&s;tion. Every evangeli&s;t is a pre&s;byter, and every presbyter is an evangeli&s;t; and if evangeli&s;ts are itinerant mini&s;ters, ordained to preach the go&s;pel among heathens and infidels, this is nothing but what presbyters may do, or have done; and if the being an evangeli&s;t in this &s;en&s;e, would prove a man to be &s;uperior to a presbyter, it will prove al&s;o, that a pre&s;|byter is &s;uperior to a bi&s;hop, as presbyters have been employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s, when bi&s;hops have thought it beneath their epi&s;copal dignity.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted by bi&s;hop Hoadly, that Timothy was bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, and Titus bi&s;hop of Crete. But this I deny, and let tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert it, prove that they were; I mean dioce&s;an bi&s;h|ops. That Timothy was bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, and titus of Crete, becau&s;e the apo&s;tle directs the former to lay hands &s;uddenly on no man; and the latter, that he left him in Crete to &s;et in order the things that were wanting, and to ordain elders in every place, is a very weak argument; &s;eeing that parrallel directions and in|formations have frequently been given by presbyters to pre&s;|byters. The apo&s;tle's direction to Timothy, to lay hands &s;ud|denly on no man, no more proves his exclu&s;ive right to ordain, than the Apo&s;tle's direction to the &s;ame Timothy, to drink a lit|tle wine, proves that his reverend brethren the presbyters, were not intitled to the &s;ame privilege; and yet upon &s;o frivolous and weak a deduction, which by no means nece&s;&s;arily follows from the premi&s;es, is the mighty &s;tructure of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy founded, &s;o far as it relates to &s;cripture te&s;timony. If Timothy had been bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, it is probable that Paul would have mentioned him under that character in the in&s;cription at the be|ginning of the epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, or in the &s;alutations at the end of it; but not a word of Timothy in either.</P>
<P>If Timothy had been bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, it is probable that Paul would have recognized him as &s;uch, in the addre&s;s he made to the Ephe&s;ian elders at Miletus, and e&s;pecially as he was taking his la&s;t leave of them; yet he mentions not a word of Timothy; nay, in&s;tead of enjoining the&s;e elders to yield obedience to Ti|mothy, or any one el&s;e as their bi&s;hop, he &s;ays unto them, take heed to your&s;elves, and to all the flock over which the Holy-Gho&s;t hath made you over&s;eers, <HI>i. e.</HI> in Greek epi&s;copous, in
<PB N="319" REF="010857_0160_0F851E3DA163BAC0">Engli&s;h, bi&s;hops. Thus then the&s;e elders were &s;tiled bi&s;hops by the Apo&s;tle, and therefore this pa&s;&s;age, as al&s;o Phil. i. 1. Tit. i. 5, 7.1. Pet. v. 1, 2. prove that the names, bi&s;hop and el|der, were indi&s;criminately given to the &s;ame officers, and all the world may be challenged to give any po&s;itive proof from &s;crip|ture, that bi&s;hops were an order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, presbyters.</P>
<P>It doth not appear from any of the epi&s;tles written to any of the churches, that they had dioce&s;an bi&s;hops; the Apo&s;tle in the in&s;cription of tho&s;e epi&s;tles, makes not the lea&s;t mention of them, which is a &s;trong argument that there were none.</P>
<P>The epi&s;tle to the Philippians is in&s;cribed to all the &s;aints at philippi, with the bi&s;hops and deacons. Ob&s;erve reader, the word is bi&s;hops, that is congregational ones, and not bi&s;hop, that is a dioce&s;an one; &s;urely this text favours not the epi&s;copal dignity; for no man of &s;en&s;e will pretend that there were more than one dioce&s;an bi&s;hop in a city. 'As the Apo&s;tle therefore &s;peaks of bi&s;hops at Philippi in the plural number, it is evident he means presbyters by that word, that the church there was governed by fellow presbyters.</P>
<P>Paul in his Epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians exhorts them to know them which laboured among&s;t them, which were over them in the Lord; and admoni&s;hed them, to e&s;teem them very highly in love for their work's &s;ake; here again he &s;peaks of the pro|phets, but not one word of the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Although the church of Chri&s;t was &s;o highly celebrated, yet the Apo&s;tle no where intimates that it had a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, When Paul wrote his Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, he particular|ly de&s;igned to heal the unhappy divi&s;ions that had ri&s;en among&s;t them; if there had been a bi&s;hop at Corinth at that time, the Apo&s;tle would undoubtedly have referred the corinthians to him, as a peace maker and healer of breaches; but as he has not done it, we may conclude that the Corinthians had no bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>In the Epi&s;tle to the Romans there is not any mention made of a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop. The Papi&s;ts pretend that Peter was bi&s;hop of Rome, but perhaps there is as little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that Peter was bi&s;hop of Rome, as that Timothy was bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us, or Titus bi&s;hop of Crete.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle to the Hebrews exhorts them, to remember tho&s;e who had the rule over them, who had &s;poken unto them the word of God; here again the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks in the plural number, thereby intimating that the&s;e Hebrews were under the govern|ment of elders or presbyters, and not a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Peter, writing to the elders, 1, Pet. i, 5. &s;ays, the elders which are among you I exhort, who am al&s;o an elder,

By this pa&s;&s;age we not only &s;ee that bi&s;hops and presbyters were the &s;ame thing, but that the Apo&s;tle Peter him&s;elf looked upon the presbyters as his fellows.</P>
<P>John the beloved apo&s;tle, 3 Ephe&s;ians 1 ver&s;e, &s;tiles him&s;elf an elder; and in&s;tead of a&s;piring at a &s;uperiority over his brethren, for which he had once been blamed by his ma&s;ter, he complains of Diotrephes, who loved the preheminence. The &s;hort limits of a News Paper will not permit me to enlarge upon the &s;everal arguments I have mentioned; I &s;hall therefore conclude for the pre&s;ent with a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The word of God in defining the e&s;&s;ential marks of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, confines it&s;elf entirely to one order of the clergy, without &s;peaking a &s;yllable of any other; &s;urely if there had been any &s;uch per&s;on as a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop e&s;tabli&s;hed, or to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Chri&s;tian church, he would have been de&s;cribed in the New-Te&s;tament; and e&s;pecially in the epi&s;tle to Timothy and Titus, wherein St. Paul treats profe&s;&s;edly on the qualifica|tions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers. If there had been different orders of go&s;pel preachers, he would, probably, have taken notice of them in tho&s;e epi&s;tles; and &s;hewed what different gifts and abili|ties were &s;everally requi&s;ite, to fit them for their re&s;pective offi|ces. But we read only of one order of the clergy in the apo&s;tle's writings; which make no mention of bi&s;hops, as di&s;tinct from elders.</P>
<P>St. Paul no where informs us, what character a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop &s;hould have. He tells you what an elder, who doth not labour in the word, &s;hould be: He tells you what a deacon, who &s;erves tables and takes care of the poor, &s;hould be, and what a preach|ing elder &s;hould be; but takes no notice of a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop. Surely if any &s;uch per&s;on had exi&s;ted in, or been intended for, the church of Chri&s;t, and if he had been of &s;o much importance to its admini&s;tration, as Dr. Chandler pretends, the apo&s;tle would have mentioned him; and e&s;pecially when he had &s;o good an opportunity of doing it in the epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus. Is it not &s;trange that in the&s;e epi&s;tles, Paul &s;hould de&s;cribe the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of the lowe&s;t officer, in the church of Chri&s;t, and not mention the highe&s;t?</P>
<P>I intend to take a more particular notice of Dr. Chandler's appeal, in &s;ome future papers, in which (I doubt not) I &s;hall fully an&s;wer Chillingworth's demon&s;tration of epi&s;copacy; and abundantly prove the futility and non&s;en&s;e of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I think what I have &s;aid already is &s;ufficient to con|vince the impartial reader, that dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, and ordi|nation by a bi&s;hop, are not of divine in&s;titution.</P>

<P>HAVING in my la&s;t gently cudgell'd the Whipper for the impudent malice of his 7th, I &s;hall now proceed to ani|madvert upon the mi&s;cellaneous <HI>&s;cribble &s;crabble</HI> of his 8th No. for the future, however, re&s;erving to my&s;elf the di&s;|cretionary power of treating him as a fool or a knave, and u&s;ing my heel or my cane as I think proper.</P>
<P>As Squire T. (par. 1&s;t) a&s;&s;ures us, it is a very ea&s;y matter for a writer to make, and implicity acknowledges the Whig has made a &s;pecious appearance in a periodical paper; it &s;hou'd &s;eem &s;trange he him&s;elf has not &s;ucceeded, who &s;o evidently 'aims at carrying his point by clamour, and rai&s;ing an odium again&s;t&mdash;(I mu&s;t not &s;ay his antagoni&s;ts, for he has none; I Sir I&s;aac Foot having, as yet, the honour to be no more than an epagoni&s;t&mdash;but) the non-epi&s;copal faction, which he is feebly en|deavouring to la&s;h in the per&s;on of the Whig. If a blu&s;tering writer, under all the advantages he could wi&s;h, egregiou&s;ly fails in a very ea&s;y matter, what mu&s;t the world think of him?</P>
<P>The Whig's malice, it &s;eems, renders him incon&s;i&s;tent. As how? Why, in finding fault with Dr. Chandler, for falling into oppo&s;ite extremes. Pray, Mr. Whipper, is it impo&s;&s;ible for a D. D. to &s;peak &s;ometimes too plain, and &s;ometimes not plain enough?&mdash;one while to rea&s;on, &s;o that the unavoidable con&s;equence is the invalidity of non epi&s;copal ordination, and afterwards for certain rea&s;ons, to &s;often <HI>invalid</HI> down into <HI>at lea&s;t irregular and defective?</HI>&mdash;Has not Dr. Ch&mdash;r (as well as Squire T.) often inadvertently expre&s;s'd even &s;elf-con|tradictory &s;entiments, and who pray, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly chargea|ble with incon&s;i&s;tencies, He who writes them, or he who, when written, <HI>holds them forth</HI> to public view?&mdash;<HI>public view!</HI> ay, there's the malice of it. So unguarded, and yet &s;o aver&s;e to detection, is guilty artifice!</P>
<P>Squire T. it &s;eems, can't find Dr. Ch&mdash;r guilty of (what is vi&s;ible to half an eye) an univer&s;al denial of the validity of non-epi&s;copal ordination. Any one, at lea&s;t who attentively reads &s;ect. 1. par. 3d. of the Appeal, is (I affirm) as blind as a bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, if he don't find Dr. Ch&mdash;r repre&s;enting all the angels in Heaven, as well as all the men on earth, without an uninterrupt|ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops, as in&s;ignificant to the validity of ordi|nation,
<PB N="322" REF="010857_0162_0F851E3F24749888">as Dr. Tickle him&s;elf&mdash;poh! I mean, Squire Tickle &mdash;(par. 8th) makes all the pre&s;byters on the continent, to the fabrication of 'a &s;ingle Chri&s;tian prie&s;t.' And if the evident real &s;entiments of both are ju&s;t, the Lord have mercy on all non-epi&s;copal churches, and that of Holland among the re&s;t! Squire T. indeed, even while (con&s;cience bound no doubt) he admits 'the church of Holland is not &s;o exactly epi&s;copal, as that of England,' wou'd fain be under&s;tood to admit al&s;o the va|lidity of Dutch ordinations; but alas (&s;uch dirty artifices are u&s;ed in eccle&s;ia&s;tical politics!) all this and much more (par. 3d and 4th) is but time-&s;erving complai&s;ance, de&s;ign'd to &s;ecure the neutrality or engage the intere&s;t of the Dutch churches, while con&s;ecrated fetters are preparing for them, as well as En|gli&s;h &s;chimatical congregations.' But is Squire T. indeed, &s;tupid enough to hope to make dupes of the Dutch churches, who very well know the church of Holland, as to con&s;titution, differs more from the church of England, than this la&s;t from the church of Rome, and that it is in every re&s;pect non-epi&s;co|pal, as much as if it were &s;trictly and properly Presbyterian? If &s;o, fie upon thee Squire T!</P>
<P>Par. 5th is of the &s;ame complexion with the greate&s;t part of No. VII. containing a mo&s;t villainous accu&s;ation of the faction as having long aimed to &s;eize the revenues of the Dutch church in New-York, which I never dreamt, heard, or read of, till the 23d of May la&s;t, and perhaps no mortal el&s;e, but Squire T. and I candidly believe, that if this virulent charge did not originate in his own head or heart, it was &s;ug|ge&s;ted by one of God's creatures of &s;uperior abilities, but of a &s;till more perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition. In this par, he again mixes bit|ter and &s;weet calumny, and what he doubtle&s;s &s;uppo&s;es to be wit; but who, be&s;ides Squire T. ever thought of 'incopora|ting a thing called a meeting-hou&s;e by charter, any more than of 'anihilating exi&s;tence by divi&s;ions? tho' every one knows iron, wood, &s;tone, &amp;c. may be ea&s;ily incorporated into a pom|pous con&s;ecrated idoliz'd thing, call'd a <HI>church,</HI> which, in &s;pite of its &s;teeple, the faction is wicked enough to believe has, when the a&s;&s;embly is ab&s;ent, no more inherent &s;anctity than the mo&s;t humble profane de&s;picable &s;tructure on the face of the globe.</P>
<P>Par. 6th 7th and 8th, Squire T. boggles mi&s;erably at the Whigs que&s;tion (No. V. par. 6th and 7th) one leg, tho' bro|ken again&s;t the &s;tumbling block, he has indeed brought over, but the other he has been oblig'd to leave behind; &s;o that there he &s;tands yet, like a witch be&s;triding the thre&s;hold of an in|chanted door. To put a good face on the matter, he makes a flouri&s;h indeed about Mon&s;ieur Houdin; but not a &s;yllable drops from his pen concerning Mr. Monroe. Why this difference as
<PB N="323" REF="010857_0162_0F851E3F24749888">to mentioning, as well as ordaining, the&s;e two gentlemen, Squire T.? alas! 'tis &s;ubterfuge all, every one &s;ees it; and yet I'll make you the be&s;t excu&s;e I can&mdash;'Twas of Dr. Chandler, and not Dr. Tickle, the Whig challenged a categorical reply to his que&s;tion; however I can't help &s;aying, that, when the lat|ter was pleas'd to appear as a <HI>catechumen,</HI> if he thought it pru|dent to be &s;ilent about Mr Monroe, it had been much more &s;o to have &s;aid nothing at all about Mon&s;. Houdin.</P>
<P>Par. 9th. he labours hard to be at a lo&s;s about the &s;en&s;e of the word match, and at la&s;t removes his &s;elf caus'd perplexity, by a mo&s;t &s;ulphureou&s;ly humourous &s;olution; and in par. 10th brings a &s;crap of Hudibra&s;s to knock down the Whig, who had been &s;o unlucky as to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the blow. However violent a Tory the author might be, the mo&s;t rigid Whigs acknowledge the merits of Hudibra&s;s as a piece of humour; but wit is not argument, and, by the way, Tickle is not Butler.</P>
<P>Par. 11th Squire T. finds fault with the Whig, for taking for granted, 'that it is impo&s;&s;ible, as the law now &s;tands, to in|troduce a bi&s;hop into America, who will not have authority, the in&s;tant he arrives, to &s;et up an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. The force of this kind of rea&s;oning (which, by the way, is no rea&s;oning at all) is not, it &s;eems, evident; but I fancy this kind of propo&s;i|tion, will, 'ere long, be &s;ufficiently evident to many be&s;ide tho&s;e Squire T. him&s;elf rages, foams, &s;wells, blu&s;ters, threatens, and prophe&s;ies, to convince, frighten, or di&s;courage. It is re|ally not more diverting, to hear a W&mdash;give lectures on female virtue, than to read what this hu&s;&s;ar in controver&s;y, this bu&s;h-fighter, has &s;o gravely written, about &s;ober argument, and candid rea&s;oning. For my part, I make no high pretences to either of the two (if two they are) and yet I flatter my&s;elf, there is at lea&s;t as much real argument, coach'd in my hints <HI>a po&s;teriori,</HI> as in Squire T's round about flagellations. Reader con&s;ider me not as guilty of vanity, for while you ju&s;tify my &s;entiments, in this re&s;pect (as I'm &s;ure you mu&s;t, if before judgment you will but compare Whig, Whip, and Kick together) you are hearti|ly welcome to think as meanly of me as you plea&s;e.

<P><HI>Sir</HI> I&s;aac Foot <HI>pre&s;ents his compliments to</HI> Timothy Tickle, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR> <HI>and thanks him for his adverti&s;ement; but begs leave to a&s;&s;ure him, that, at the time of its publication, it was generally known, that there had been a convention of officious mi&s;&s;ionaries in this city, at which (whatever the de&s;ign of their meeting might have been) the &s;acred text,</HI> For yet a little while, and he that &s;hall come, will come, and will not tarry, <HI>was by a mo&s;t decent Chri&s;tian perver&s;ion, applied to the arrival of a profane, i. e. a political creature, the work of men's hands, commonly called a</HI> BISHOP.</P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL. July 21. The CENTINEL. [No. XVIII.]</HEAD>
<P>WHEN de&s;igning men have any &s;chemes to execute, which may be prejudicial to the rights and privileges of others, rea&s;ons, different from tho&s;e which really influence them, are contrived and thrown out to amu&s;e the populace, and to divert their attention from the con&s;equences, that may follow from the execution of their &s;chemes. This &s;eems to be the poli|cy of the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries, in their attempts to introduce bi&s;hops into the American colonies.</P>
<P>In our la&s;t Centinel, we con&s;idered their idle pretence of the want of di&s;cipline, as it is urged by Dr. C. as an argument in favour of the propo&s;ed epi&s;copate, We will now con&s;ider ano|ther artifice to gild the di&s;agreeable pill that it may be &s;wal|lowed without &s;u&s;picion, namely, that the&s;e new bi&s;hops are to have no power over the laity.</P>
<P>It is well known, there are among the laity, many moderate members of the epi&s;copal communion, who dete&s;t &s;piritual do|mination, as much as others, and who are as tenacious of their civil and religious liberties, as the members of any other church, and therefore likely to be alarmed at this dangerous innovation. Le&s;t the&s;e &s;hould proceed on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that to prevent the yoke from being fixed upon them, it was the &s;afe&s;t way to oppo&s;e the &s;cheme, of introducing the&s;e new ma&s;ters into the co|lonies, they are fir&s;t deprived of their natural right of being con&s;ulted on the important article, and then they are amu&s;ed with the fal&s;e and incon&s;i&s;tent hopes of being entirely ex|empted from the juri&s;diction of the American bi&s;hops. We call it an in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;i&s;tent hope, as it is contradictory not only to the known &s;entiments of the Engli&s;h epi&s;copal church, but al&s;o to the &s;entiments of every other Chri&s;tian church in the world. This plan of American bi&s;hops is a mere novel invention, with|out any parallel in hi&s;tory either &s;acred or profane, &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a church upon earth; and yet no doubt, &s;ome zealous clergy will tell us, it is the pure apo&s;tolic plan. It &s;eems &s;trange, indeed, that the clergy of the church of Eng|land, who are, doubtle&s;s, Dr. C's &s;uperiors at home, who have &s;ettled this plan, (if indeed they ever &s;ettled it) &s;hould deviate &s;o much from the model of their own and of every other Chri&s;tian church, as well as from the di&s;cipline pre&s;cribed in the &s;cripture. A church, who&s;e members are exempt from the government of
<PB N="325" REF="010857_0163_0F851E3FE0282D80">its officers, is what no age can furni&s;h an example of. The in|con&s;i&s;tency, therefore, of this plan with the known principles of the church of England, give grounds to &s;u&s;pect that Dr. C. has not given us the plan on which bi&s;hops are to be &s;ent to America, with that openne&s;s and candour that might have been expected.</P>
<P>But this is not the only rea&s;on we have to &s;u&s;pect, that there is &s;omething more at the Bottom, than what Dr. C. &s;eems wil|ling to confe&s;s. Sundry pa&s;&s;ages in the appeal (where Dr. C. was off his Guard and therefore expre&s;&s;ed the true &s;entiments of his heart) &s;eem to convince us, that the laity mu&s;t yield obedi|ence to the new &s;piritual lords, and &s;ubject their unpracti&s;ed necks to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical yoke preparing for them. We &s;hall point out &s;ome of the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>The church, &s;ays he, con&s;idered with relation to civil power, being in the very nature of it a voluntary &s;ociety, it is left to men's con&s;ciences, whether they will become members of it or not. But after they are become members of it, the laws of the church are in force again&s;t them, and they are &s;ubject in eccle&s;i|a&s;tical matters to the authority of tho&s;e who govern it. What the ju&s;t penalties of di&s;obedience are, we may learn from the na|ture of the church it&s;elf. The utmo&s;t effect of its power in this world is the cutting off and rejecting &s;uch members, as are incureably and dangerou&s;ly corrupted.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">App. p. <HI>30.</HI></NOTE> Let the world, to which the doctor appeals, judge how con&s;i&s;t|ent this is with the declaration, <Q>That the American bi&s;hops are to have no authority, nor indeed to exerci&s;e any di&s;cipline over their own people, the clergy excepted.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>p.</HI> 95.</NOTE> Let but bi&s;hops be once introduced to govern the clergy, and the laity will &s;oon hear it a&s;&s;erted, and probably feel it to their co&s;t, <Q>That from the very nature of the church, its laws are in force again&s;t them, and they are and mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the authority of tho&s;e who govern it.</Q></P>
<P>Again Dr. C. tells us, <Q>When bi&s;hops were fir&s;t propo&s;ed or reque&s;ted for this country, they were mentioned under the title of &s;uffragans. This is no ambiguous term, it has a fixed and determinate meaning in the Laws of England, and cannot be mi&s;taken.

Is it not an office merely epi&s;copal to take notice of and to puni&s;h the irregular and &s;can|dalous behaviour of the members of the church, to take cogni|zance of &s;candal and cau&s;es matrimonial?

<P>The power then of the&s;e &s;uffragans is to rule and govern both prie&s;ts and people, according to the model of the Engli&s;h church; to govern well the people, who are members of their church and put under their care; to correct remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in duty, &s;candalous practices, athei&s;m, dei&s;m, &amp;c. and yet if we believe Dr. C. 'their authority &s;hall operate only upon the clergy and not up-the laity, or di&s;&s;enters of any denomination.'</P>
<P>Another thing I would ju&s;t remark. It is agreed on all hands, that the American bi&s;hop is to govern the clergy. Dr. C. tells us 'his power over them &s;hall be as full and as complete as the laws and canons of the church directs,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>p.</HI> 31.</NOTE> and yet that '&s;pi|ritual courts will never be e&s;tabli&s;hed here.'<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">96.</NOTE> What is this but to &s;ay, that an arbitrary &s;piritual juri&s;diction, unknown in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and abhorrent to the rights of freemen is a&s;ked and about to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in America. Alas for the poor clergy; if, when their characters and livings are in que&s;tion, they mu&s;t hear from the mouth of a proud eccle&s;ia&s;tic, <HI>&s;ic volo, &s;ic jubeo, &s;tat pro ratione voluntas.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A WHIP FOR THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XVI.]</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY TIMOTHY TICKLE, <ABBR>ESQR</ABBR></BYLINE>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Here march my Grammarians, &s;killed to torture words; there my Sons of &s;ophi&s;try, ever ready to wre&s;t a meaning,</P>
<BIBL><HI>PARNELL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Per&s;on once a&s;ked a &s;cholar what was the meaning of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff, which &s;tands for the dige&s;ts or pandects; and was hu|mourou&s;ly an&s;wered that it &s;ignified <HI>Farrago &s;arraginum;</HI> as much as to &s;ay&mdash;'an heap of mi&s;erable &s;tuff.' Or if a more literal tran&s;lation plea&s;e thine ear, reader, the meaning is&mdash;'an hodge-podge of hodge-podges.'</P>
<P>How ju&s;tly de&s;criptive of No. XII. of the American-Whig, is this an&s;wer! If thou wilt ca&s;t thine eye upon it, indignant reader, thou wilt find it to be an heap, hoard or congeries, of mi&s;erable &s;tuff; an hodge-podge of hodge-podges. It con&s;i&s;ts of three detached pieces&mdash;all worthy of the Whig and his a&s;&s;ociates; but utterly impertinent to the di&s;pute now debating before the re&s;pectable tribunal of the public; and unworthy of its notice. And I &s;hall &s;o far imitate the Whig, as to depart from order&mdash;he is a di&s;orderly man,&mdash;depart, I &s;ay, from the order in which the&s;e pieces are placed, and begin with the la&s;t of them, and &s;o proceed, as it were, by a retrograde motion.</P>
<P>A gentle la&s;h will be &s;ufficient for each of the&s;e flim&s;y, &s;en&s;e|le&s;s things. Now, the la&s;t is a letter to the Whig, from one of his under &s;pur-leathers; filled with wrath again&s;t Dr. Chandler and his brethren, becau&s;e they &s;ometimes call the church of England, the church; altho' this is no other than the language which has been u&s;ed by Engli&s;h writers &s;ince the reformation&mdash;di&s;&s;enters as well as churchmen. Calling meeting hou&s;es by the name of churches, or independents, members of the church, is a very late refinement, and unknown to our forefathers. My elde&s;t &s;on, who is but twelve years old, can remember the fir&s;t of this cu&s;tom. If any per&s;on however on reading that letter, can perceive one grain of &s;en&s;e, or candour in it, he is welcome to it for his Pains.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of this multifarious Whig is another letter, &s;igned Obadiah Wheeler, and written in the We&s;t country dia|lect; which is here palmed upon the public as an original, but
<PB N="329" REF="010857_0165_0F851E4169400F00">in reality is pilfered from an old magazine, and republi&s;hed with a very few alterations. Our plagiary talks away about <Q>kowz, zowz and goozy chikz</Q>&mdash;his fellow creatures; about giving a bribe to the American Whig, <Q>to put in a cavie again&s;t a biz|hup.</Q> Now, however unable the public may be to &s;ee the pertinency of this letter to the ca&s;e of American bi&s;hops; I am pretty confident they will be able to &s;ee an apparent connection between a bribe and the American Whig. The a&s;&s;ociation of the&s;e in our ideas, is very natural; and &s;o much for Mr. Wheeler.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> That is to &s;ay, meaning and referring to part the fir&s;t of this <HI>farrago farraginum,</HI> in which the American Whig him&s;elf makes his per&s;onal and corporal appearance&mdash;It &s;peaks its origin plain enough. The author of it makes mention of 'the wi&s;dom of politicians&mdash;of wi&s;e and able &s;tate&s;men'&mdash;words, which come from his mouth, with equal propriety and grace as the words cha&s;tity and virtue from the mouth of a pro&s;titute. The burden and de&s;ign of his production is to &s;hew&mdash; <Q>That the &s;pirit of high churchmen is ab&s;olutely incompati|ble with that of our excellent con&s;titution; and was their power equal to their wi&s;hes, they would neither eat nor &s;leep, before they had turned a limitted monarchy into an ab&s;olute one&mdash;that when they talk of moderation, they mean want of power&mdash;that &s;hould a future mini&s;try be weak enough ****** to gratify the in&s;atiate ambition of &s;ome of our rampant, high church clergy, the colonies will be debauched from their loyalty&mdash;that an American epi&s;copate would cut a&s;under the cord which ties them to the mother country&mdash;for let them have but funds of their own by the management of their &s;pi|ritual father the bi&s;hop&mdash;then adieu for ever to their political mother, old England.</Q></P>
<P>And this zealous friend to our con&s;titution and to old England, expre&s;&s;es his ardent love to both. But it unfortunately happens, <Q>that he &s;o unnaturally counterfeits the voice of a &s;heep, that no reader upon earth can di&s;criminate it from that of a wolf.</Q></P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay which is mo&s;t to be admired, or which predo|minates mo&s;t in this repre&s;entation&mdash;fal&s;hood or malice.&mdash;This writer not only in&s;ults truth, but the under&s;tanding of every reader. Altho' he &s;ingles out High churchmen, it is beyond any doubt, that by tho&s;e he means, all who have any degree of zeal for the intere&s;t of the church of England, or that would thwart his pernicious de&s;igns, and intolerant principles. What warm friends the clergy of the church of England, and parti|cularly bi&s;hops, have been to our con&s;titution and liberties, eve|ry page almo&s;t of the hi&s;tory of England fully evinces. And
<PB N="330" REF="010857_0166_0F851E4229C92C90">every page almo&s;t of that hi&s;tory refutes this infamous calumny, which is thrown out, to blind and debauch the multitude, by a faction who&s;e principles, who&s;e writings, who&s;e conduct, de|mon&s;trate them to be republicans, and enemies to our con&s;titu|tion&mdash;even to a limited monarchy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here mention one memorable pa&s;&s;age in our hi&s;tory, which will &s;hew what warm friends to our con&s;titution and li|berties tho&s;e were, whom our Whig calls high churchmen. James ii. was a weak, mi&s;led prince&mdash;a dupe to popery and prie&s;ts. He manife&s;tly de&s;igned to introduce popery and arbitrary power in England, and overturn the reformation. One of the fir&s;t and chief engines he employed for this purpo&s;e, was di&s;|pen&s;ing with tho&s;e laws, which exclude papi&s;ts from places of power and tru&s;t. At Oxford and Cambridge, if I remember right, the fir&s;t attempts to exerci&s;e this di&s;pen&s;ing power, were tried; where it met with all the oppo&s;ition that the members of tho&s;e two illu&s;trious univer&s;ities could give it. Soon after this, the king ordered 'a declaration of liberty of con&s;cience' to be read in all churches thro' England; which was done only to pave the way for popery. With this the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;ix bi&s;hops who then happened to be pre&s;ent, refu&s;ed to com|ply; and pre&s;ented a petition to the king, remon&s;trating again&s;t it; knowing that it had a direct tendency to let in popery, and de&s;troy the liberties of the nation. And for this refu&s;al and re|mon&s;trance, tho&s;e &s;even bi&s;hops were clapt into the tower, and there held in durance. There was no event which contributed more to rou&s;e the &s;pirit of the nation, point out its danger, and bring about the revolution, than this. Never was a nobler &s;tand made for liberty than this was; yet the&s;e bi&s;hops were &s;uch as our Whig would call <HI>high churchmen.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that whil&s;t the church clergy oppo|&s;ed tho&s;e arbitrary mea&s;ures, and refu&s;ed to comply with king James's injunctions, di&s;&s;enters pre&s;ented &s;everal addre&s;&s;es of thanks to him on the occa&s;ion. Even from New-England ad|dre&s;&s;es were tran&s;mitted to king James, for granting a general liberty of con&s;cience. I will not anticipate the reader's reflecti|ons on this occa&s;ion; nor pretend to determine whether tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es originated from a de&s;ire to &s;ee the church of England cru&s;hed; which mu&s;t have fallen the fir&s;t victim, being the &s;tronge&s;t barrier again&s;t popery and arbitrary power; or whether di&s;&s;enters were not impo&s;ed on by &s;pecious pretences and promi&s;es, and &s;o lulled to &s;leep by the king's emi&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add further at pre&s;ent, that when the&s;e particulars, and many more which the world ere long &s;hall be informed of, are con&s;idered, our Whig, even in point of prudence and re|gard
<PB N="331" REF="010857_0166_0F851E4229C92C90">to his cau&s;e, were truth and ju&s;tice entirely thrown a&s;ide ought to be more cautious in a&s;&s;erting what none will believe, viz. that churchmen are enemies to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution&mdash;<HI>parcius i&s;ta nobis tamen objicienda memento</HI>&mdash;i. e. <Q>Mr. Whig, remember you are the la&s;t per&s;on that &s;hould upbraid us with &s;uch things.</Q></P>

<P>JOY, joy, joy, my good friend Tickle. With all my heart I give you joy. I thought your victory complete when Sir <HI>I&s;aac Foot</HI> (and a &s;ooty fellow he is) attacked you; but <HI>pro patria</HI> has put the matter out of a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;pute. I always look|ed upon you as a man of con&s;iderable merit; but I can a&s;&s;ure you that your reputation has gained much by the little, low, dirty tricks, that your adver&s;aries, e&s;pecially the worthies above|mentioned, have thought proper (if ever they thought at all) to have recour&s;e to. Strange it is, that &s;ome people will pretend to write before they have learned to read! I thought the knight the mo&s;t illetirate and in&s;ignificant of all the race of Adam; but <HI>pro patria</HI> has convinced me of my error. I am therefore &s;o far indebted to him. Nor am I the only per&s;on whom he has laid under obligations. You your&s;elf, Mr. Tickle, are much beholden to him. He has laid hands upon you, Mr. Tickle; he has ordained my friend the &s;quire. Well; may I peri&s;h, but he is a good-natured &s;oul! He has &s;aved you the trouble of a couple of 3000 miles voyages, and the expence of many a thirty &s;hilling bill. If you are not the mo&s;t ungrateful of Men, as he is the mo&s;t contemptible, you cannot but thank him.&mdash;But perhaps you do not allow the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination? Mr. Tickle, Mr. Tickle, you are utterly mi&s;taken, Mr. Tickle. Not only <HI>pro patria,</HI> but all the other Independents in the coun|try &s;ay the &s;ame. What they think is a different matter. But &s;o many of them, from time to time, having been re-ordained by bi&s;hops, is no good argument in their favour. Nay, I am convinced, and &s;o are they too (and, <HI>hinc illae lacrymae</HI>) that if epi&s;copal ordination could be had upon as ea&s;y terms as pre&s;|byterian, four fifths of the whole clan would be happy in receiv|ing it. This their followers know, and therefore are &s;o out|rageou&s;ly bitter again&s;t the introduction of a bi&s;hop to the conti|nent. They would &s;ink into their primeval nonentity. And as for the threats again&s;t the per&s;on of a bi&s;hop, they know in their hearts that they dur&s;t not touch a hair of his head. However, it &s;erves to &s;hew their &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, for which they have ever been infamous, and which I am per&s;uaded they will always exert, when ever they have the power to do &s;o. But it &s;eems,
<PB N="332" REF="010857_0167_0F851E434542FC20">Mr Tickle, that you have &s;aid the Whig is written by a faction. Is this excu&s;able? Is this, my reverend friend, (I a&s;k pardon for not giving you the title &s;ooner) is this language for a Chri&s;tian man,&mdash;for a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter? Truth is not to be &s;poken at all times; and this, quoth <HI>pro patria,</HI> is not the proper time. And <HI>pro patria</HI> &s;aith well.

In time, both he, and his friend Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> may be equal to their ma&s;ters. <HI>Par nobile Fratrum;</HI> if peradventure they be two.

<P>I Should now pur&s;ue my confutation of the divine right of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy (a doctrine which Dr. Chandler has very unnece&s;&s;arily obtruded on the public, and which I am therefore compelled to con&s;ider, in order to give a complete an|&s;wer to the appeal) but having promi&s;ed, in my fir&s;t number, not to fatigue the reader with the dry cru&s;t of un&s;avoury con|trover&s;y, I &s;hall endeavour to relieve his &s;pirits with a very dif|ferent &s;cene. As to the &s;ubject now &s;u&s;pended, I &s;hall &s;oon re|&s;ume it, and hope &s;o effectually to expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of that pretence, as well as tho&s;e two other pretty prie&s;tly conceits,&mdash; <HI>confirmation,</HI> and the <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> as to prevent the

<P>In a letter of bi&s;hop Kennet, printed in the hi&s;tory of his life, that excellent prelate has the&s;e memorable words: <Q>He was</Q> (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of the great and good Dr. <HI>Teni&s;on,</HI> then late arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury) <Q>truly &s;en&s;ible, that at home and abroad we were in great danger of lo&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, in the name of the church. The two great difficulties that lie hard upon our &s;ociety, for propagation of the go&s;pel, are, (1) The want of &s;ober and religious mi&s;&s;ionaries; few offering them&s;elves to that &s;ervice, for the glory of God, and the good of &s;ouls; but chiefly to find a refuge from poverty and &s;candal. &mdash;(2) Such men, when they come to the places allotted them, forget their mi&s;&s;ion; and, in&s;tead of propagating Chri&s;tianity, are only contending for rites and ceremonies, or for powers and privileges, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;What particular conduct of the mi&s;&s;ionaries that venerable prelate then re&s;ented, with &s;o much Chri&s;tian zeal and impartiality, I cannot determine. But that many of them have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, made a practice of giving them&s;elves an air of importance, in their letters to the &s;ociety, at the expence of truth, will appear evident to any per|&s;on, who will be at the pains of peru&s;ing the ful&s;ome extracts annexed to the anniver&s;ary &s;ermons preached before that board. &mdash;That they have lately entered into a combination to a&s;per&s;e the American colonies, in which they re&s;ide, in order to facili|tate their darling project of an American bi&s;hop, repre&s;enting his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, of every denomination, differing from their own, as entertaining principles, unfriendly to our excellent con&s;titution; (for which they know in their con&s;ciences, there is not the lea&s;t colour of pretence) is abundantly apparent from the following letter. On this notable epi&s;tle, I &s;hall at pre|&s;ent make no other ob&s;ervation, but that the public may de|pend on it to be genuine, and that I have no other rea&s;on for con|cealing the author's name, than my di&s;inclination to expo&s;e him to the righteous indignation of his injured country; but that if either of the two weekly &s;cribblers for the convention, will in&s;i&s;t on his being made a &s;acrifice to the popular re&s;entment, for his &s;candalous mi&s;repre&s;entations of the mo&s;t loyal people in the world, rather than lo&s;e the plea&s;ure of charging me with a fa&s;hood; they may make their challenge with their u&s;ual friend&s;hip for truth and decency, and they &s;hall be gratified.

<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE cau&s;e of the church in America is &s;o &s;acred and intere&s;ting a point, that every faithful friend to it, who even ventures to wi&s;h him&s;elf able to contribute the lea&s;t in its favour, di&s;covers a well affected zeal to expre&s;s his affection, and intreat the promotion of it. This indeed more evidently appears in the clergy, where it ought to appear; having the concurrence of all, from whom the be&s;t wi&s;hes, and their religious needs in the pre&s;ent imper|fect &s;tate which they enjoy, the church can only be expected to &s;trengthen and enforce the common plea; and al&s;o the adjuvant agency of others, that are con&s;picuous enough to afford &s;ome encouragement from their endeavours, &s;pirited by that ardent af|fection for the church, which the faith of the invaluable trea|&s;ure &s;he contains in her divine apo&s;tolic authority and con&s;titu|tion, and the whole&s;ome doctrines &s;he di&s;pences in the &s;criptures, animates. The clergy of &s;everal of the provinces have re&s;pec|tively tran&s;mitted addre&s;&s;es to the throne, and &s;ome of the chief dignitaries of the church, and the incorporated &s;ociety, for an American epi&s;copate, to engage as exten&s;ive an intere&s;t in the affair as might be practicable; <HI>particulars have thought it expedient, and have applied to &s;uch per&s;ons as might, and from whom they had good grounds to hope, would be u&s;eful in a ca&s;e &s;o greatly beneficial to us,</HI> and the act &s;o highly charitable to them; &s;olicitous to bear a part in every effort of this kind, joint as well as &s;eparate, I take the freedom to propo&s;e the &s;ubject to you, as what I am per&s;uaded mu&s;t be e&s;teemed by you, &s;ufficient to me|rit your clo&s;e&s;t attention; the cau&s;e is &s;acred to the honour of God, and the &s;ouls of men: We al&s;o apprehend it &s;o to the health of the con&s;titution; a con&s;ideration proper to be attend|ed to, in the&s;e di&s;tant parts of his maje&s;ty's dominions; and what is conceived may be advantageou&s;ly improved, as the ar|guments in favour of it, may be more pointedly urged and en|forced upon the minds of different per&s;ons, as they &s;hall be in|clined to regard the church, in a religious or civil view; or both together. Your connections with &s;ome of the nobility, and with his maje&s;ty's chaplains, is apprehended to place you in a &s;ituation kind to this purpo&s;e; and this cheri&s;hes hopes of your readine&s;s and ability, to be u&s;eful among tho&s;e in this particular bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>THE &s;pleen and malignity, &s;o remarkable in the American Whig, again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, has, I dare &s;ay, rous'd the re&s;entment of every true &s;on of that apo&s;tolic commu|nion. However, as to my&s;elf, I, who have the honour to be a member of the &s;ame, have &s;ound no &s;mall alleviation (under the arguments and in&s;ults utter'd again&s;t it) from the con&s;idera|tion, that all the logic, or &s;atire, of him and the faction, will not be of the lea&s;t avail, either to him&s;elf or them: Nay, they will only augment their infamy and reproach, as I &s;hall demon|&s;trate anon. Is it not ridiculous for a man to &s;quabble with a kitchen maid, in the face of the public?&mdash;Would any but fools contend, when &s;ure of being foiled, and expo&s;ing their in|capacity
<PB N="337" REF="010857_0169_0F851E448F437498">and rancour, the view of the world? This is the ca&s;e of the &s;chi&s;matics and Whig; they worry and vex them&s;elves in vain; being ignorant of the very &s;cheme, by which our pious de&s;igns are conducted. At once to terminate their cavils, I &s;hall di&s;clo&s;e the plan of our future proceedings, again&s;t tho&s;e Here|ticks.</P>
<P>The venerable &s;ociety (amid&s;t per&s;ecutions and oppre&s;&s;ions) have zealou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted the pious de&s;ign of chri&s;tianizing di&s;|&s;enters in America, and transforming them into members of the national church. The devout labours of their mi&s;&s;ionaries, have been rewarded with a plentiful harve&s;t. Numbers have been per&s;uaded to abandon the &s;chi&s;matical conventicles, which (as that venerable &s;aint Mr, Checkly, avers) have neither a valid mini&s;try or ordinances; and join'd the communion of our church: Religion, according to the liturgy, flouri&s;h'd. Ample account of the&s;e converts were tran&s;mitted to the venerable &s;oci|ety at home, who&s;e pious &s;ouls exulted at the &s;ucce&s;s, and were almo&s;t ravi&s;h'd at the pro&s;pect of epi&s;copizing America. The&s;e devout emotions, received, neverthele&s;s, a mortifying check, by the mo&s;t wicked reproaches of the faction. They had the ef|frontery to traduce the characters of the godly mi&s;&s;ionaries, and of the &s;ociety it&s;elf. The latter they accus'd of perverting the end of their in&s;titution; and that in&s;tead of employing their do|nations and care, in converting the aboriginal pagans, to the Chri&s;tian faith, and knowledge of a Saviour; they wantonly lavi&s;h'd their money, in perverting di&s;&s;enters; &s;quandering large &s;ums in opulent towns, which were amply &s;upplied with preach|ers of irreproachable characters; while the indigent, and tho&s;e who were unable to &s;upport the mini&s;try, were neglected. The mi&s;&s;ionaries were repre&s;ented as expending that charitable boun|ty, not in the lea&s;t in advancing Chri&s;tianity; but in &s;educing di&s;&s;enters, from the pure and unadulterated go&s;pel of Je&s;us, to a perverted go&s;pel, and in teaching for doctrines the command|ments of men. Such were the malicious &s;landers, uttered by the faction, and dilently propagated by their abettors. Hereby the animating expectations of the venerable &s;ociety were bla&s;ted, their per&s;ons traduced, and many charitable donations re&s;train'd. Notwith&s;tanding, our dignitaries judging it nece&s;&s;ary to con|vert the &s;ectaries, that they might not ob&s;truct their &s;ucce&s;s among the heathen, they vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted their beneficient plan, and their &s;ucce&s;s was adequate to their zeal. Many de|&s;erted their former puritanical dogmas, and became zealous a&s;|&s;ertors of epi&s;copal faith. Pompous accounts of pro&s;elytes were &s;tran&s;mitted to that reverend body, which were confirmed by their lord&s;hips, and u&s;her'd into the world, with triumph and
<PB N="338" REF="010857_0170_0F851E45237875A8">joy. Thus the venerable board, continued to exert them&s;elves with unremitting ardour, amid&s;t the clamours of the faction; and, altho' by the animating accounts &s;ent by the mi&s;&s;ioaries, it was expected that &s;chi&s;m would long 'ere now have been extir|pated, and the whole American continent metamorpho&s;ed into epi&s;copalians; yet &s;ince the pious mi&s;&s;ionaries (as Dr. Chandler ob&s;erves) had no other weapons to avail them&s;elves withal (while altar was &s;et up again&s;t altar) but the feeble efforts of argument, which were common to the faction them&s;elves, no wonder their &s;ucce&s;s was not proportioned to their devout wi&s;h|es; but after about &s;ixty years a&s;&s;iduous labour, the greater part &s;till retained their inveterate prejudices.</P>
<P>Some of their lord&s;hips, in their anniver&s;ary &s;ermons before the venerable &s;ociety, had laid it down as a maxim, 'that they could not expect to convert the heathens, 'till they had fir&s;t chri&s;tianiz'd the di&s;&s;enters.' This was far from being effectu|ated, and therefore, on the pre&s;ent plan, the heathen mu&s;t be neglected to &s;ome far di&s;tant period. This rous'd their zeal to attempt &s;ome new expedient.&mdash;What mu&s;t be done? They mu&s;t rid them&s;elves of di&s;&s;enters, who ob&s;truct the conver&s;ion of pagans, to the religion of the liturgy! To epi&s;copize them, is like to be the work of ages! The mo&s;t compendious method imaginable, would be to change the &s;pecies of the&s;e ob&s;tinate hereticks, that they might no longer ob&s;truct the go&s;pel among the pagans. Accordingly, on the 20th of February, 1767, my lord of Landaff, in pre&s;ence of that venerable &s;ociety, meta|morpho&s;ed the whole &s;chi&s;matical herd into <HI>'infidels, with more than brutal manners!'</HI> This rare atchievement was de&s;ervingly approv'd by that re&s;pectable body, and the operator received their cordial thanks. This was a bold, but effectual '&s;troke. This craft had been dormant from the venerable Circe, 'till re|viv'd by her pre&s;ent right r-v&mdash;d &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and no author &s;ince Ovid, has had the honour to record &s;uch a mutation, ex|cept my&s;elf. The legends of Rome contain nothing worthy of competition. All ob&s;tacles towards converting the pagans are now vani&s;hed. Not a di&s;&s;enter remains in America. They are become fellow-infidels with their brethren, the natives.&mdash;No more clamour about perverting di&s;&s;enters. Good people may now be invited to give, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of converting infi|dels. By this a large field is opened for needy mi&s;&s;ionaries; and gain and godline&s;s may go hand and hand. Yet, the&s;e quon|dam di&s;&s;enters, retain, even &s;ince their mutation, &s;omething of their former rancour; which may be no &s;mall exerci&s;e to our pious mi&s;&s;ionaries. It might (to &s;peak with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion) have been better, if they had been &s;etenced &s;laves; for altho' the
<PB N="339" REF="010857_0170_0F851E45237875A8">Whig is an infidel, I doubt not he believes, his lord&s;hip with equal veracity and ea&s;e, might have denominated them negroes and &s;laves. Then like the Scythians of old we might have re|turn'd with Whips, and driven them from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to our no &s;mall emolument. But they have been confirm'd infi|dels, and who dares di&s;pute epi&s;copal confirmation? How long they are like to retain their pre&s;ent form, depends on their con|duct. Should they &s;till prove refractory, they might next be cla&s;&s;ed with the brutes; &s;hould they conform to the liturgy, like Lucian's a&s;s, they might re-a&s;&s;ume their pri&s;tine form. What &s;trange transformation the ob&s;tinate may &s;till expect, you may learn from example. Cr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> of Bo&s;ton, for di&s;puting the reality of this change, and in&s;i&s;ting on the identity of former di&s;&s;enters, was immediately, by epi&s;copalian &s;light, hooted into a ram-chicken, but has not yet been confirm'd in that character by a bi&s;hop's hand. What changes will be inflicted on W. Living&s;ton, and the Whig, mu&s;t be left to the wi&s;dom of the convention. They may &s;uffer as many metemp&s;yco&s;es as a Py|thagorean, or &s;hapes as a &s;ilk-worm. For the pre&s;ent it was determined, to la&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Whig in revenge, before he could be metamorphos'd out of the way.&mdash;But, who &s;hall perform this ignominious ta&s;k? None of the convention, tho' &s;ufficiently vexed, had courage to accept, They knew he di&s;avowed pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience; and &s;hould they Whip, he might return the compliment, and repel his aggre&s;&s;or. On mature deliberation, Tabitha Ket|tle was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en for this arduous office. She had been cook to the rev Mr. Diotrephes, and brought up in his kitchen and principles. She had the honour to belong to the church by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, and read exactly the prayers, and le&s;&s;ons, of each day (without daring to exceed) in obedience to authority. Her favourite books were Checkly, Hudibra&s;s, and the &s;ervice book; all of which &s;he read with equal devotion. Her e&s;teem for mi&s;&s;ionaries aro&s;e almo&s;t to adoration&mdash;and her abhorrence of di&s;&s;enters to dete&s;tation. In her di&s;putes, &s;he was furious and loud; and when clamour could not de|cide, the broom&s;tick and ladle were call'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t. This hero|ine received a mi&s;&s;ion, to pelt and &s;cold at the Whig&punc; But on her inve&s;titure with &s;o important an office, it was re&s;olved to me|tamorpho&s;e her &s;ex&punc; and dignify her with a ma&s;culine name, as near as may be, &s;imilar to her former. Accordingly, in&s;tead of <HI>Tibitha Kettle,</HI> &s;he a&s;&s;umed the name and title of <HI>Timothy Tickle,</HI> <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR> Thus being ma&s;culated, &s;he accepted her po&s;t; and having Hudibra&s;s in her pocket, to furni&s;h her with proper ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and arm'd with her u&s;ual weapons, the broom&s;tick

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL. July 28. The CENTINEL. [No. XIX.]</HEAD>
<P>IN clearing up difficulties and in adju&s;ting differences that oc|cur in any &s;ociety, it is the &s;ure&s;t way to look back to the original principles on which the founders proceeded; to ex|amine how they and their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors under&s;tood, and how they acted upon the&s;e in&s;titutes. This has been ac|knowledged to be a regular procedure in civil policy, and in ex|pounding human laws: It &s;eems &s;till more proper in revealed re|ligion, who&s;e author is infallible. If the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;ti|anity had made this their rule, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d oftener recurred to the words of their lord, and to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> writings and practice of his apo&s;tles: If they had always made the Bible their directory in faith and di&s;cipline; and determined to call no man on earth ma&s;ter, abundance of mi&s;guided zeal, angry contention and cruel per&s;ecution might have been avoided; much corruption in doctrine and di&s;cipline prevented; and the primitive &s;implicity of the go&s;pel better maintained.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t denominations of Chri&s;tians are indeed ready enough to appeal to &s;cripture, and to be determined by it, when|ever they think it favours their peculiarities. Nay they will
<PB N="341" REF="010857_0171_0F851E45E3F39918">torture it by forced con&s;tructions to &s;peak favourably of their di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets, even where it would &s;eem to expre&s;s a con|trary meaning. But the human inventions and corruptions of &s;ome churches are &s;o plainly again&s;t &s;cripture, or unwarranted by it, that this method of defence will not always an&s;wer. Re|cour&s;e is then had to tradition, pretended apo&s;tolic u&s;age, the &s;uppo&s;ed right of the church to decree rites and ceremonies, and to in&s;titute new modes of di&s;cipline. (if not to add new articles of faith) for the &s;upport of the&s;e innovations: A method by which almo&s;t any ab&s;urdity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">error or u&s;urpation might be vin|dicated, and the Chri&s;tian faith intirely thru&s;t a&s;ide, to make room for the weak or wicked devices of men.</P>
<P>In the matter I have now in view, Dr. Chandler appeals in|deed to &s;cripture; though many will think, without good ground. However he cannot be charged with wire-drawing its meaning, as he adduces no particular proofs of what he never|thele&s;s roundly a&s;&s;erts. The pa&s;&s;age of his memorable appeal to which I refer is this; 'if we carefully examine the writings of the apo&s;tles, the&s;e things will evidently appear, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour before his a&s;cen&s;ion, committed the government of the church entirely to them;&mdash;that this government was exerci&s;ed by them;&mdash;that they conveyed this power to others, to be communicated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to others to the late&s;t po&s;terity;&mdash; particularly that the&s;e their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, were an order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to tho&s;e now called pre&s;byters; and that none who were not of this order, had the powers of ordination and government committed to them.' But although he does not &s;tay to offer proof, yet he mentions for in&s;tances, <HI>James</HI> as dioce&s;an of <HI>Jeru&s;alem; Timothy of Ephe&s;us; Titus</HI> of <HI>Crete;</HI> and the angels of the &s;even churches of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>It would have been &s;atisfactory to many of his readers, if the doctor had pointed out the pa&s;&s;ages in the New-Te&s;tament, which &s;o clearly prove, that the great head of the church has com|mitted the government of it entirely to dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, as &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of the apo&s;tles; becau&s;e &s;o important a claim ought to be &s;ub&s;tantially &s;upported. To in&s;truct mankind in the doctrines of the go&s;pel, we indeed find a charge given, accompanied with a promi&s;e of power from on high to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in doing it. But even &s;uppo&s;ing this commi&s;&s;ion and promi&s;e limited to the twelve, what do they make for the &s;ole authority of modern prelates? The apo&s;tles were an extraordinary &s;ett of men; they had no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors circum&s;tanced as they were: Nor after the choice of <HI>Matthias</HI> in the room of <HI>Judas;</HI> and the divine appointment of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> do we read of any new elections. As they were to
<PB N="342" REF="010857_0172_0F851E478E278518">be cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es of the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts of Apo&s;. <HI>i. 22.</HI></NOTE> it was not po&s;&s;ible they could long continue a di&s;tinct order: Their charac|er and name accordingly died with the generation in which they lived.</P>
<P>In ordinary matters, the apo&s;tles, however, exerci&s;ed no &s;uck &s;ole juri&s;diction. They preached and delivered the Chri&s;tian doctrines as of divine authority, and they proved their mi&s;&s;ion by works of an extraordinary nature; &s;uch as the death of <HI>Ananias and Saphira,</HI> the blindne&s;s of <HI>Elymas,</HI> and the like. But in tho&s;e matters in which only their conduct can be exemplary, they did every thing with the common voice of the church. Thus were the deacons cho&s;en. In this manner did they pro|ceed in giving their judgment upon the controver&s;y at <HI>Antioch</HI> referred to the church at Jeru&s;alem, concerning the obli|gation of the Mo&s;aic law over the gentile converts to Chri&s;tianity. St. <HI>Paul</HI> upbraiding the Corinthians for remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s of di&s;cipline in a ca&s;e of ince&s;t, tells them <Q>that when they were gathered together,</Q> they ought, 'with the power of Chri&s;t,' to excommunicate the guilty per&s;on. And in his 2d epi&s;tle, &s;peaking of the &s;ame affair, he &s;ays, '&s;ufficient to the man was the puni&s;hment, or cen&s;ure, which was inflicted by many.' What became of the &s;ole authority of the bi&s;hop in the&s;e ca&s;es? How came the 'multitude,'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid;</HI> vi. 5.</NOTE> the 'whole church,'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid:</HI> xv. 22.</NOTE> the 'many' to meddle with the apo&s;tolic or epi&s;copal rights. Nay', how dur&s;t any teachers at <HI>Antioch</HI> to di&s;&s;ent from, and di&s;pute with <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabus,</HI> one, if not both of them, of the &s;uperior order, to whom the government of the church. ac|cording to Dr. C. had been entirely committed? And whatever blame they incurred for error in doctrine, how happened it, that they e&s;caped without cen&s;ure for want of due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an apo&s;tle? The great Lord chancellor Bacon, who &s;peaks the general &s;en&s;e of the doctor's church from the reforma|tion till his time, differs widely from him. His words are remark|able; I &s;hall give them at large, He &s;ays, 'on reading the Scriptures, I never could find, but that God had left the like liberty to church government as to civil government, to be varied according to time, place and accidents: Which neverthele&s;s his high and divine providence orders and di&s;po&s;es. For all civil governments are re&s;trained from God to the general grounds of ju&s;tice and manners; but their poli|cies and forms are left free, &s;o that monarchies, &s;enates, and po|pular &s;tates, are lawful, and where they are planted ought to re|main

So in the church, the &s;ub&s;tance of the doctrine is immutable; but for rites and ceremonies, particular hie|rarchies, policies and di&s;ciplines of churches, they are left at large. It is proper therefore to return to the ancient degrees of unity in the church of God, which were one faith, one bapti&s;m; not one hierachy, one di&s;cipline.' This penetrating genius was &s;o far from &s;upporting the hierarchy of the church of England, (of which he was a zealous defender) even from primitive prac|tice, that he &s;ubjoins, 'the times of per&s;ecution were excellent times for doctrine and manners; <HI>but are improper and un&s;uitable examples of external government.'</HI></P>
<P>That the apo&s;tles conveyed this &s;ole power, which Dr. C. a&s;cribes to them, to others, to be handed down in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is equally de&s;titute of proof. If they a&s;&s;umed no &s;uch power them|&s;elves; if in the ordinary affairs of the church, they and the evangeli&s;ts and elders, mentioned in Scripture, exerci&s;ed none, how could they convey it over to &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul, who was an in&s;pired writer, in giving his judg|ment in matters to which his divine direction did not reach, could &s;ay, 'I &s;peak this by permi&s;&s;ion, and not of commandment.' <HI>1.

Corinth. vii. 6.</HI></NOTE> The pa&s;tors and mini&s;ters of the church, called by the people and &s;olemnly &s;et a|part by the apo&s;tles and evangeli&s;ts, had the power of preaching the go&s;pel; and &s;ays a great writer, 'there is an empire in preaching:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Jer. Taylor.</NOTE> But the &s;upreme direction of the affairs of the churches, as a&s;&s;umed by modern prelates, was exerci&s;ed by none. The people jointly with their elders judged, even in excommu|nication. This pa&s;&s;age of the doctor's implies the nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which he had ju&s;t before a&s;&s;erted very explicitly; notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a notion, and the many inconveniencies attending it, have been often expo&s;ed. Mr. Locke's argument again&s;t it is invincible. If, &s;ays he, a &s;ociety enjoys the benefit of the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, according to his promi&s;e, that 'where <HI>two or three</HI> are gathered together in his name, he will be in the mid&s;t of them,' they want neither bi&s;hops by unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, nor any thing el&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of &s;ouls.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the bi&s;hop <HI>Stillingfleet's</HI> Iren.

As in civil govern|ment, where a failure of the royal family, or other defect in the admini&s;tration is made good by the inherent power of the com|munity; &s;o in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, the church may interpo&s;e and &s;up|ply every deficiency.

<P>That bi&s;hop and pre&s;byter are the &s;ame in Scripture, has been &s;hewn in a former paper; and further, that many great men of the church of England have thought &s;o. The in&s;tances of dio|ce&s;an epi&s;copacy given by Dr. C. have no countenance from the New-Te&s;tament; for the notes &s;ubjoined to the epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus, in the opinion of the learned, were added 500 years after the&s;e epi&s;tles were written. Titus was left be|hind at Crete to ordain elders or bi&s;hops (as they are al&s;o called) in every city, which would rather prove that he was an arch|bi&s;hop. But it is evident Timothy and Titus were evangeli&s;ts, employed in &s;preading the glad tidings of &s;alvation to infidel nations; con&s;equently they had no &s;ettled charge. The prima|cy of Peter at Rome, and the prelacy of James at Jeru&s;alem &s;eem much of equal &s;olidity; and re&s;t equally on tradition. The angels of the &s;even churches in the prophetical language of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> are evidently put for the churches them&s;elves. But the prelatical cau&s;e labours much, when recour&s;e is had to &s;uch precarious and &s;lender proofs; which would not be offered if bet|ter could be had.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD>To TIMOTHY TICKLE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am a member of the church of England, and zealou&s;ly at|tached to its doctrines and di&s;cipline.&mdash;For many years I have been retired from bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;pend the evening of my days on a plea&s;ant rural rece&s;s, far removed from the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle incident to cities and larger towns. My farm affords me all the nece&s;&s;aries and &s;ome of the conveniencies of life. As I am not engaged in the pur&s;uit of riches or power, much of my time is devoted to the contemplation of <HI>heavenly things;</HI> &s;ome to a few favourite authors; and I, <HI>now and then,</HI> amu&s;e my&s;elf by reading the public papers, whil&s;t curling eddies of &s;moke wafted from the cheerful pipe, diffu&s;e a grateful odour thro' my little habitation.</P>
<P>But with the utmo&s;t grief and indignation, I have ob&s;erved of late, that a <HI>rude and virulent attack</HI> has been made upon the church, in &s;everal parts of the continent; and pro&s;ecuted in &s;uch a manner, that, decency and candour have been &s;acrificed, by writers 'hackney'd in the ways of men,' to the accur&s;ed &s;pirit of party and di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>What could have been the motive of the&s;e writers for &s;uch a procedure, mu&s;t be left to the &s;earcher of all hearts: Sure I am, however, that it is contrary to the principles of Chri&s;tian charity;&mdash;that it can never &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth and reli|gion; &mdash;that it breaths a &s;pirit of bigotry and malevolence;&mdash; that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of <HI>meek</HI> but <HI>firm</HI> a&s;&s;er|tors of the rights of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Whether it flows therefore, from minds imbitter'd by any <HI>di&s;appointment,</HI> or is the pure effect of zeal without knowledge;
<PB N="346" REF="010857_0174_0F851E49173302B8">in either ca&s;e I condemn it; &s;ince we are taught by the oracles of divine wi&s;dom, not only to be <HI>wi&s;e as &s;erpents, but al&s;o harm|le&s;s as doves.</HI></P>
<P>Virulence and rancour, with &s;arca&s;tic and illiberal reflections, can never properly &s;erve a cau&s;e: They irritate, but do not con|vince, &mdash;they rankle in the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e at whom they are aimed, widen tho&s;e breaches which for the honour of Chri&s;tiani|ty ought to be clo&s;ed up; and de&s;troy that brotherly love which our Saviour &s;o &s;trongly recommended to all his di&s;ciples. To the eye of impartial rea&s;on, the authors of <HI>calumny</HI> &s;uffer mo&s;t by it; for they forfeit the heart-felt &s;atisfaction, ari&s;ing from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence and integrity.</P>
<P>Mi&s;repre&s;entation indeed, may prevail for a time: But it will not bear examination before which it flies, like the early mi&s;t before the morning &s;un.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, SIR, that I am a churchman by profe&s;|&s;ion &mdash;As &s;uch I pray for the <HI>whole Catholic church;</HI> and not for that alone, but for <HI>Jews, Turks and, infidels;</HI> for all the race of Adam, whether within the verge of Chri&s;tianity, or as yet mi&s;erably enveloped in <HI>darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death</HI>&mdash; Tho' I e&s;teem the <HI>doctrines</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> of my own church to be the mo&s;t pure, and conformable to the will of God: Yet in pur&s;uance of the golden rule of "doing as I would be done by." I would have every one enjoy liberty of con&s;cience in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive manner.&mdash;This liberty mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t, not in pri|vately entertaining any &s;et of religious opinions; becau&s;e at that rate there could hardly be any &s;uch thing as per&s;ecution; the &s;ecrets of the heart being un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earchable to any but the Almighty &mdash;But it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the free, open, and undi&s;turbed pro|fe&s;&s;ion of our &s;aith; the being allowed publickly to wor&s;hip God in that mode we e&s;teem mo&s;t agreeable to him; a moral &s;ecuri|ty, that we &s;hall not be hereafter prevented from thus acting; and an exemption from any peculiar and grievous hard&s;hips on a religious account.</P>
<P>No &s;ect can be properly &s;aid to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, un|le&s;s it has within it&s;elf the means of continuing its faith and wor&s;hip. If the Pre&s;byterians were prevented from ordaining their pa&s;tors in the accu&s;tomable manner, and among them&s;elves, I verily believe they would complain, that they did not enjoy liberty of con&s;cience in its rea&s;onable extent, &s;ince their religion could only be of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I grant that every other denomination, not danger|ous to the &s;tate, &s;hould have liberty of con&s;cience, I think I may boldly challenge the &s;ame indulgence for the church in as full a manner at lea&s;t.&mdash;It has been alledged indeed, that the
<PB N="347" REF="010857_0174_0F851E49173302B8">church laboured under no hard&s;hips; and that on the contrary, there was danger le&s;t it &s;hould become a church <HI>rampant and gubernant.</HI>&mdash;Let any one but reflect on a voyage acro&s;s a wide and boi&s;terous ocean; the many perils and dangers it pre&s;ents to our eyes;&mdash;the lives that are lo&s;t thereby;&mdash;and the prodi|gious expence attendant on it:&mdash;Let him al&s;o reflect that the orders of the <HI>church of England</HI> can be obtained on no other, but on the&s;e di&s;couraging terms; and then let him candidly re|&s;olve me, whether this is a hard&s;hip or not?</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid to be a maxim in law, that equity is equality. <HI>Equi|tas e&s;t qua&s;i Equalitas.</HI> If the church of England is not e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>America;</HI> yet I conceive, by the rules of equity, it ought to be upon an equal footing with other &s;ects of Chri&s;tians. Whil&s;t they can receive ordination in their native land and at a &s;mall expence; why &s;hould the members of the church be obliged to &s;eek it at &s;uch a di&s;tance, &s;o mon&s;trous an expence, and imminent hazard of their lives?</P>
<P>But we have been told, in one number of the Whig, that <HI>America</HI> will, in a cour&s;e of years, be the happy <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> to which Britain mu&s;t betake her&s;elf; when that i&s;land, at pre&s;ent the &s;eat of empire, will become a province to &s;ome haughty con|tinental power. As I quote entirely from memory, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, Sir, if I have not given the Whig's own words; how|ever, I believe his &s;entiment is farthfully pre&s;erved&mdash;Allowing that Great-Britain mu&s;t betake her&s;elf to <HI>America,</HI> where &s;hall the church betake her&s;elf for orders; &s;ince tis plain, the Whig does not intend to admit bi&s;hops, with, or without a cargoe of carnalities, to accompany the other parts of the con&s;titution into <HI>America?</HI> Nay, he tells us in another number, upon what au|thority I know not, that the introduction of a bi&s;hop, however rea&s;onable, upon the plan propo&s;ed, would produce a &s;cene of di&s;order, &s;imilar to what we have experienced upon a late occa&s;i|on. When this dreadful period therefore &s;hall arrive, the church, &s;o far from being <HI>rampant and gubernant,</HI> can be no more: Her &s;ons mu&s;t, in direct oppo&s;ition to their principles, go into the arms of independency, and &s;ee their religion (redeemed from the errors of Popery, by the blood of &s;o many martyrs) give place to one, they e&s;teem far le&s;s pure, and le&s;s perfect.</P>

<P>Another writer indeed, has attempted to cut the gordian knot which he could not untie.&mdash;The centinel propo&s;es that the convention &s;hould a&s;&s;emble together; choo&s;e one of their mem|bers

That writer &s;hould have con&s;idered, however he plumes him&s;elf upon his invention, that the con&s;titution of the church of England does not admit of <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> bi&s;hops; and, that he might as well propo&s;e no expedient, as one that cannot be con&s;cientiou&s;ly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Parmenio</HI> told <HI>Alexander,</HI> that were he in his place, he would accept a peace which that monarch thought di&s;honoura|ble: He made this noble an&s;wer, "that &s;o would he, were he <HI>Parmenio.</HI>" The members of the convention, may in like man|ner, an&s;wer the Centinel, that they will elect &s;uch a bi&s;hop as he mentions, when they become Centinels; when they have re|nounced the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the church of England, and can con&s;cientiou&s;ly acquie&s;ce in a form of church govern|ment, outwardly re&s;embling the epi&s;copal, but actuated by Inde|pendent principles.</P>

<P>HOW highly &s;oever the reverend members of the conven|tion may value their own rights and privileges, they certainly ought not to de&s;ire any new immunities, mani|fe&s;tly tending to the abolition or infringement of the un|doubted rights of others. Did they really de&s;ire, or was there the lea&s;t probability of obtaining &s;uch an ideal bi&s;hop, as they hold up to public view, in order to lull us into &s;ecurity, while them&s;elves are pro&s;ecuting their &s;cheme, for procuring a true modern prelate, no other denomination ought in ju&s;tice to give them any oppo&s;ition. Thus far we are perfectly agreed. But the matter of difference between us is, that as the law &s;tands they cannot have, nor indeed do they de&s;ire, &s;uch a bi&s;hop as they would per&s;uade the world they are &s;oliciting for. With re&s;pect to the impracticability of that project, it has already been con&s;idered; and may perhaps hereafter be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall now endeavour to convince the impartial reader, that they do not de&s;ire &s;uch a bi&s;hop; but that this pretence, like a &s;yren &s;ong, is only intended to delude us to ruin. I am told the author of the appeal complains of it, as ill-u&s;age to be di&s;be|lieved in his prote&s;tations on this head. But whatever may be his character, as a man of veracity (as indeed in no other in|&s;tance &s;hould I di&s;credit his word) he cannot require impo&s;&s;ibili|ties; and I flatter my&s;elf to be able to convince any rea&s;onable man, that to believe his declarations on the &s;ubject matter now before us, is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. For be&s;ides the extreme &s;tu|pidity of confiding in the promi&s;es of this &s;ort of gentry, when a darling project is to be carried, any longer than they labour under an incapacity of breaking them, it having been their con|&s;tant practice to violate tho&s;e kind of engagements, whenever their de&s;igns were &s;ufficiently matured to defy oppo&s;ition (as &s;hall hereafter be abundantly &s;hewn from hi&s;tory) it is evident from their pre&s;ent conduct, that a primitive bi&s;hop is as far from their thoughts, as primitive Chri&s;tianity. And can they de&s;ire us to take the word of their champion in &s;o momentous a mat|ter, when it is &s;o plainly contradicted by the proceedings of the convention? Have they in their petitions, have they in their letters, for a bi&s;hop, &s;aid a &s;ingle &s;yllable about a primitive one? Have they not prayed for one, without mentioning any limita|tion or re&s;triction? Is not the &s;ettlement the Dr. talks about,
<PB N="352" REF="010857_0177_0F851E4F53194070">a meer non-entity? and their refu&s;al to publi&s;h their petitions, an unan&s;werable argument, that they will not, that they dare not, di&s;clo&s;e their real intentions? Nay it appears by the appeal it&s;elf, that were &s;uch a bi&s;hop really to come, he is to be tran&s;|formed into a down-right pontifical &s;overeign, as &s;oon as ever the epi&s;copalians have &s;ufficient power, to ride the other religi|ous denominations. We have therefore other rea&s;ons for di&s;be|lieving their &s;pecious pretences be&s;ides what may be drawn from that in&s;atiable thir&s;t of power, of which they betray &s;uch violent &s;ymptoms. Our &s;u&s;picions are not barely grounded on their panting after deanaries and prebendaries, as the hart pant|eth after the water brooks: We have the declaration of their own advocate, that they are determined to en&s;lave us as &s;oon as they can. For only attend to the gradual evolutions of his &s;cheme; mark the progre&s;s of his rea&s;oning, to convince the world, of his de&s;iring only a harmle&s;s bi&s;hop; and you will find how widely the doctor differs from&mdash;the doctor. The bi&s;hops, &s;ays he, to be &s;ent to America (page 79) <HI>&s;hall not interfere with the properties or privileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or di&s;&s;enters.</HI> No places of civil power are to be &s;ought for, nor accepted of. No taxes to be impo&s;ed.&mdash;All this is plau&s;ible enough; and had he &s;topped here, our faith had not perhaps been totally non-plus'd; tho' the bare con&s;idera|tion of the quarter it came from, had been &s;ufficient to give it a little da&s;h of incredulity. But in page 111, we &s;tumble upon a very different &s;tory. Here the ma&s;que is dropped; and the hi|therto di&s;gui&s;ed humble petitioner, for a plain primitive apo&s;to|lic innoxious bi&s;hop, appears an open &s;turdy arrogant claimant for civil power, and worldly riches. So arrogant that whoever is oppo&s;ed to his claim, that is to &s;ay, whoever wants to hold him to his own word, before plighted with great &s;olemnity, and without re&s;erve, is to be con&s;idered as a bad &s;ubject. <HI>If bi&s;hops,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hould be inve&s;ted with a proportionable degree of civil</HI> authority, neither would there be any rea&s;on for complaint. But is not their interfering with civil authority, a manife&s;t inter|fering with our civil privileges, contrary to the word of God, as well as to the doctor's prior profe&s;&s;ion, and mo&s;t explicit pro|mi&s;e? Yet this is no cau&s;e for complaint. He has indeed good rea&s;on to wi&s;h it &s;hould not be complained of, &s;ince a more dreadful evil is &s;o clo&s;e at its heels. For it &s;eems the depriva|tion of our civil privileges, is to be attended with the emptying of our pur&s;es. His lord&s;hip's inve&s;titure, with civil authority, will not &s;atisfy the whole of this gentleman's demand. For what prelate would be content with power, without riches? We are therefore to be taxed for &s;upporting him, in all the pomp
<PB N="353" REF="010857_0177_0F851E4F53194070">and &s;plendor of an American Viceroy. But &s;ee in what a &s;neak|ing, mealy-mouthed, half-choak'd he&s;itating, claiming, di&s;|claiming, denying, avowing, bungling, manner, this con|traband commodity is &s;muggled into port. <HI>Shall we not be taxed</HI> (page 107) <HI>for the &s;upport of bi&s;hops? I an&s;wer not at all. But &s;hould a general tax be laid upon the country, and thereby a &s;um be laid &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, yet I believe &s;uch a tax would not amount to more than four pence in &pound;</HI> 100, <HI>and this would be no mighty hard&s;hip on the country. He that would think much of giving the &s;ix-hundredth part of his income, to any u&s;e the legi&s;la|ture of the country, &s;hould a&s;&s;ign, de&s;erves not to be con&s;idered in the light of a good &s;ubject.</HI> I can &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ay, I never met with any book in my life, that contain'd &s;o much tergiver&s;ation and hypocri&s;y, in &s;o &s;hort a compa&s;s. Pray, what does the gentle|man mean by a &s;um &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e? What purpo&s;e is it that any &s;um is wanted for? Cannot a primitive bi&s;hop go|vern the clergy, ordain and confirm, without four-pence in the &pound; 100 of our e&s;tates? It is therefore beyond all que&s;tion, whatever airs the gentlemen of the convention may give them&s;elves, on our not believing things incredible, that it is really (notwith&s;tanding all prote&s;tations to the contrary) the <HI>modern, &s;plendid, opulent, court-&s;avoured, law dignified, &s;uperb, magnificent, powerful, prelate, on which their hearts are &s;o in|tent;</HI> and of what would be deemed &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e, I &s;hall before I conclude this paper, give the reader a &s;pecimen. I a&s;k further what does he mean, by telling the world that four-pence in the &pound; 100, would be &s;ufficient? Is not this repre&s;enting us as immen&s;ely rich? And are not our enemies at home keenly enough bent on loading us with taxes, without having their &s;to|machs &s;timulated by this gentleman's re&s;ounding our imaginary affluence? For how many millions mu&s;t we not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, if four-pence in &pound; 100 would produce &s;uch a &s;um as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, would be thought but barely <HI>&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e?</HI> Has not his trumpeting our riches, for which there is no more foundation than for his impeaching our loyal|ty, and equally ridiculous with his preten&s;ions of hearing the &s;ound of a trumpet that never &s;ounded, a natural tendency to whet the appetite of tho&s;e, who, like &s;o many harpies, are ga|ping for our &s;ub&s;tance? Does not the Dr. know, that we groan under di&s;tre&s;&s;es un&s;peakable? That we are involved in debts in|&s;olvable? That with re&s;pect to trade, to ca&s;h, to bu&s;ine&s;s of every kind, the colonies were never in a more deplorable condi|tion? How unfriendly then to his native country, to in&s;til &s;uch fal&s;e notions of our wealth, into tho&s;e who will probably turn them to our undoing?&mdash;And what does he mean by its being
<PB N="354" REF="010857_0178_0F851E4FD6B245B0"><HI>no mighty hard&s;hip?</HI> Pray why &s;hould the people, to gratify his pride and ambition, be laid under any hard&s;hip? king David &s;corned to build an altar on the thre&s;hing floor of Ornan, with|out paying him the full price, 'tho the generous man offered it to him gratis. He wanted not other people to pay for his reli|gion; nor to &s;erve God at the proper co&s;ts and charges of Di&s;|&s;enters. Again, who can tell how great the hard&s;hip mu&s;t be, before the gracious and candid Dr. Chandler will allow it to be a mighty one? Would not he think it a hard&s;hip, and a migh|ty one too, to be obliged to pay one farthing in a hundred pounds, to the &s;upport of any other religious denomination in the world? And is this doing to others, as he would that they &s;hould do unto him? However compliant this gentleman may imagine him&s;elf to be, before the experiment has been tried up|on him&s;elf, to uncon&s;titutional and partial impo&s;itions under co|lour of law, others do not always mea&s;ure the mightine&s;s of a hard&s;hip by the quantum, but by the partiality and inju&s;tice of the tax; and its being made a precedent for greater impo&s;itions. On the&s;e principles it was, that the late &s;tamp-act was &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; and on the&s;e principles it is, that the tax levied on the non-epi&s;copalians, for the epi&s;copal churches in &s;everal of the counties in this province, has always been complained of as a hard&s;hip; and that by people who de&s;erve as much to be con|&s;idered in the light of good &s;ubjects, as the doctor, or any of his fraternity. And who told him that the legi&s;lature of any pro|vince, or of any kingdom, is &s;o unaccountable and omnipotent, as that every &s;ubject, who approves not of every act they pa&s;s, de&s;erves, on that account, the cen&s;ure he has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow? Does he not know, that in all free &s;tates, that part of the legi&s;lature e&s;pecially, which is compo&s;ed of the repre&s;enta|tives of the people, is entru&s;ted by the people for certain purpo|&s;es; and that &s;hould they violate their tru&s;t, they would de&s;erve blame; and that con&s;equently no &s;ubject for blaming them, would him&s;elf de&s;erve to be blamed? Are his notions of pa&s;&s;ive-obedience and none-re&s;i&s;tance &s;o &s;ublimated as to think, that if a future legi&s;lature of the colony in which he re&s;ides, &s;hould e&s;ta|bli&s;h popery, he would forfeit the character of a good &s;ubject, for thinking much of paying four-pence in &pound; 100 to the &s;up|port of the Romi&s;h religion? But as he is preparing the way for the proceedings of &s;ome future a&s;&s;embly, under epi&s;copal influence&punc; we are anathematized by way of anticipation, &s;hould we &s;o much as li&s;p our di&s;content again&s;t a tax bill, of the nature of what follows.</P>

<P>The afore-mentioned &s;everal articles and &s;alaries are, I be|lieve, as moderate as would be thought &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; and at this rate, in order to rai&s;e the annual &s;um expended on the hierachy (after having paid the two hundred and ninety-three thou&s;and, nine hundred and eighty pounds, for accommo|dating his lord&s;hip with his dome&s;tic appendages) the province mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth one hundred and thirty millions, four hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds. A pretty piece of in|telligence truly to tran&s;mit to old England! But it being impo&s;|&s;ible to rai&s;e the &s;um required at the rate of 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the Dr.'s epi&s;copal legi&s;lature will be obliged to make a differ|ent calculation; and as the preci&s;e value of the e&s;tates real and per&s;onal of the good people of this colony is, at pre&s;ent, un|known, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for his lord&s;hip, after the ancient
<PB N="357" REF="010857_0179_0F851E510C4A1E40">and laudable example (and which in all probability they will chri&s;ten, as they now do confirmation, by the name of a divine ordinance) of William the conqueror, to introduce a dooms|day book of all our e&s;tates and effects, and who can tell but, according to that &s;urvey, in&s;tead of four-pence in the &pound; 100, we may be &s;addled with &pound; 5 in the &pound; 100, to rai&s;e the above primitive and apo&s;tolic &s;tipends. And is this the boa&s;ted mode|ration of the convention? And do the&s;e people pretend to be the di&s;ciples of that Je&s;us, who had not where to lay his head; or the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e apo&s;tles, who travelled without &s;crip or pur&s;e? Good God! what an impo&s;ition on the rea&s;on of man|kind! what a &s;hocking abu&s;e of the divine name and authority! By all that is dear and valuable, my friends and countrymen, I entreat and implore you not to &s;uffer your&s;elves to be deceived, by the idle pretence of a primitive bi&s;hop; when they, maugre all their refinements in artifice, &s;o plainly di&s;cover their real in|tentions. Of all bondage, &s;piritual bondage is the wor&s;t. But we are to be involved in bondage, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic. Pray gentlemen, ponder this momentous matter.&mdash;If you do not con&s;ider, po&s;terity will feel. Fir&s;t or la&s;t it will be known who are friends to the liberty of the country; the convention who thir&s;t for an hierachy, that would end in our utter de&s;truc|tion, or the author of the American Whig, who is labouring to avert it. In &s;o glorious a cau&s;e I de&s;pi&s;e their weekly calumnies, and that matchle&s;s abu&s;e and virulence, with which the tories (for &s;uch we have lately di&s;covered among us) have ever per&s;e|cuted all who &s;tand in their way.</P>
<P>In the above calculation, I have only taken notice of the field officers in the &s;able regiment.&mdash;I have made no allowance for Subalterns (whom a man may number, that can count the &s;tars of Heaven.) For as &s;oon as the bi&s;hops arrive, we mu&s;t expect, as indi&s;pen&s;able concomitants, a great number of Vicars, Cu|rates, &amp;c. The&s;e are to be &s;ettled up and down, thro' every town and country in the province, which has but three or four families, that for their unhypocritical behaviour, have been ex|pelled church-communion with the preci&s;e ones; and having manfull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rned epi&s;copalians, have found a cordial welcome, and uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rupted tranquility of con&s;cience, in the gentle and indulgent bo&s;om of the church.

If by the <HI>good will, liking</HI> and <HI>approbation</HI> of the epi&s;copal churches in general, with which he <HI>avers</HI> and <HI>in&s;i&s;ts</HI> the appeal was in&s;tituted &amp;c. he means their <HI>formal con|currence,</HI> I beg leave to doubt of the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion;&mdash; if thereby he means their <HI>&s;ilence,</HI> &s;uppos'd expre&s;&s;ive of a&s;&s;ent, I &s;hall not di&s;pute the point with him; <HI>&s;ilent</HI> they doubtle&s;s were, knowing perhaps as little of the <HI>appeal</HI> or its &s;ubject matter, be|fore its publication, as the non-epi&s;copalians them&s;elves; of which la&s;t I never yet heard a &s;ingle per&s;on &s;ay he thought it <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> or that he had no objection to make to the propos'd introduction of a bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Par. 2d. 3d. 4th and 5th. Our repliant (whoever he be) not only &s;peaks of &s;everal things as manife&s;t, which are by no means &s;o, but pretends to know &s;o well the con&s;ciences and hearts of Dr. <HI>Ch&mdash;r</HI> and the convention, that I am autho|riz'd to conclude, that the council for the appellant is either the convention, the individual appellant him&s;elf, or &s;ome &s;im|ple mortal, who out of the folly of his own heart, has without any con&s;cience at all, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en it into his head to patronize the cau&s;e. That it is the convention in a body, I'm not inclin'd to believe; for it were a &s;ad ca&s;e indeed, if no one in &s;o re&s;pecta|ble body as between 20 and 30 mi&s;&s;ionaries met in order to write again&s;t Whigs, cou'd excogitate &s;omething new, without tiring the court with nau&s;eous repetitions. The appellant him|&s;elf is &s;urely a man of too much &s;en&s;e to chew &s;uch an in&s;ipid cud over and over again, or to make &s;uch po&s;itive declarations as to what had or had not enter'd into the hearts of the conven|tion: Nor would he certainly have retain'd as council &s;uch a &s;impleton as <HI>Richard Pleadwell.</HI> It is therefore manife&s;t, that he is &s;ome &s;tupid pettifogger, the fire of who&s;e zeal has expos'd him to his own charge (par. 6th) of having &s;urreptitiou&s;ly, wilfully and corruptly, contrary to law, taken upon him&s;elf to appear as council for the appellant, and made him as liable as he &s;uppo&s;es the council for the appellees to be, to a writ of maintenance.</P>
<P>On par. 6th and 7th I have to ob&s;erve, that with regard to the point in que&s;tion, it matters not whether the American epi&s;copal clergy be rich or poor, rea&s;onable or exorbitant in their claims, potent or impotent, whether there be a dean and chapter or not, and whether the king's Conge d'elire can or cannot obtain in America; whether there is or is not a manife&s;t propriety and fittne&s;s in point of policy, that the king &s;hou'd be the
<PB N="360" REF="010857_0181_0F851E51F4BFA1B0">head of the church, where-ever it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; whether the church of England is or is not e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the colonies; or even whether the Doge of Venice, is or is not Mayor of the city of New-York.&mdash;However I &s;ay the&s;e things may be, the conclu&s;ion drawn from the &s;tatutes produe'd, remains in|conte&s;tible, and is confirm'd (if that can be any confirmation) by even the oaths of the &s;ub&s;cribing Engli&s;h clergy, in &s;pite of all Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has &s;aid, who wou'd fain mince down an ab&s;olute dependance upon, into a derivation of certain powers from hu|man laws. Tho&s;e &s;tatutes were not as (Mr. <HI>P.</HI> mi&s;takenly &s;up|po&s;es) advanc'd to prove "that there can be no right of epi&s;|copacy exclu&s;ive and independant of human laws;" but that there actually is no &s;uch right within the realm of England. And &s;ince <HI>non dat quod non habet,</HI> &s;ince all the prelates of Great-Britain can by con&s;ecration confer no diviner right than they have them&s;elves, it is manife&s;t, that the right of epi&s;copacy de|riv'd from England, in whatever manner bi&s;hops may be ap|pointed, can never become more divine in America. So that on the whole Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI> pleads very ill; and his two para|graphs under con&s;ideration, as well as the divine right of epi&s;|copacy evidently are equally nugatory with the divine right of geography. Were we to rea&s;on in Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s way, we might &s;ay, "one might as well ridicule the divine right of ordination as the divine right of popery," this la&s;t being indeed an higher degree of epi&s;copacy; but the truth is, with regard to divine right, epi&s;copacy differs as much from ordination as in practice epi&s;copacy does from preaching; which difference is evident from the pious examples of mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops in Great Britain.</P>
<P>In replying to the &s;econd cau&s;e of demurrer, re&s;pecting tithes, Mr. <HI>P.</HI> alledges, that a bi&s;hop's title to them cannot be try'd by an ejectment at law (as Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> for his client had a&s;|&s;erted) but (o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mi&s;erable blunder! oh unlucky expre&s;&s;ion!) in a <HI>&s;piritual Court,</HI> the very thing we are afraid of! poor <HI>P.</HI> your tongue I dare &s;ay, itches to plead &s;uch a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The true meaning of the word <HI>profert</HI> in law I know not; but this I am clear in, that if all Dr. <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;r<HI>'s</HI> repre&s;enta|tions are ju&s;t (however in&s;en&s;ible, repugnant and contradictory the terms may be) the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> negroes, tho' infidels, mu&s;t needs be virtual church-men.</P>
<P>For over-ruling the 4th cau&s;e of demurrer, Mr. <HI>P.</HI> comical|ly eno'conceives it "&s;ufficient to find that an harmle&s;s bi&s;hop is known in the go&s;pel", but alas! rea&s;oning from <HI>the go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> to <HI>the laws of</HI> Great-Britain, will never an&s;wer. <HI>Harmle&s;s bi&s;hops,</HI> in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, there have been, and I doubt not are; but &s;uch I aver are not as &s;uch, known in the law.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="010857_0181_0F851E51F4BFA1B0">
Mr. <HI>P.</HI> it &s;eems, prote&s;ts again&s;t the &s;entence given by the appellees as premature, on pretence that the i&s;&s;ue between the parties was not duly joined. What was wanting to a right i&s;&s;ue, I wi&s;h this juri&s;prudent gentleman wou'd inform the public.</P>
<P>Par. 8th, No. X. Mr. P. in circumlocutary phra&s;es tells us, "that from time immemorial it hath been manife&s;t, that &s;ome per&s;ons <HI>ever will</HI> di&s;approve &amp;c."

<HEAD>A WHIP FOR THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XVIII.]</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIMOTHY TICKLE, <ABBR>ESQR</ABBR></BYLINE>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. iii. 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;Evil Men and Seducers &s;hall wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, deceiving and being deceived.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the XIIIth Num. of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> the <HI>American Churchman</HI> again makes his appearance. Concerning this writer, I have now two or three conjectures to make, which &s;eem to me to affect the merits of his paper; and I think there is con&s;iderable <HI>pre&s;umptive evidence</HI> to &s;upport them. My fir&s;t conjecture (which has been before hinted at in my VIth Numb.) is, that this <HI>American churchman</HI> is only the <HI>American Whig,</HI> who has put on the <HI>appearance</HI> of a churchman, that he may the more effectually <HI>deceive</HI> and <HI>de&s;troy.</HI> The hints for this con|duct, he might po&s;&s;ibly borrow from an ancient adept in this &s;ame <HI>trade of deceiving,</HI> who we are a&s;&s;ured by good authority, can, when occa&s;ion requires, <HI>transform him&s;elf into an angel of light.</HI></P>
<P>My &s;econd conjecture is, that he is &s;ome <HI>paltry retainer to the law,</HI> or has got &s;ome pitiful po&s;t; and that he is afraid of having his con&s;equence, or, what may be of greater con&s;e|quence to <HI>him,</HI> his <HI>fees,</HI> le&s;&s;ened by the arrival of a <HI>bi&s;hop:</HI> This may be the rea&s;on why he is &s;o violently "oppo&s;ed" to bi&s;hops and &s;piritual courts.</P>
<P>My third conjecture is, that this <HI>American churchman</HI> is &s;ome <HI>delinquent,</HI> who having &s;uffered on the other &s;ide of the <HI>atlan|tic,</HI> according to his demerits, in a &s;piritual court, thinks he may &s;afely vent his &s;pleen and malice at the di&s;tance of a thou|&s;and leagues.</P>
<P>The&s;e conjectures appear probable to me; I may however be mi&s;taken; I pretend not to <HI>infability: That</HI> I leave to their <HI>ho|line&s;s,</HI> the <HI>pope,</HI> and the <HI>American Whig.</HI> Which of <HI>them</HI> has the be&s;t right to it, they may at their lei&s;ure determine between them&s;elves. But that the <HI>American Whig</HI> has very high pre|tentions to <HI>infallibility:</HI> and that he never will &s;uffer the <HI>pope</HI> to ingro&s;s it all to him&s;elf, may be made very evident by a few queries, <HI>viz.</HI> What evidence has the <HI>American Whig,</HI> that the clergy want not &s;uch a <HI>primitive bi&s;hop,</HI> as is &s;pecified in the
<PB N="363" REF="010857_0182_0F851E52AC52AE00"><HI>appeal;</HI> but on the contrary, a <HI>modern, &s;plendid, opulent, court-favoured, law-dignified, &s;uperb, magnificent, powerful, bloody-minded, Sin promoting, con&s;cience-killing, &s;oul-de&s;troying, hell-de&s;erving</HI> prelate?&mdash;<HI>An&s;.</HI> His own <HI>infallibility.</HI>&mdash;What evidence has he, that in the &s;even abominable petitions, which he &s;ays were &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> by the convention, the loyalty of the <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> was impeached?&mdash;<HI>An&s;.</HI> His own <HI>infallibility.</HI> What proof has he, that the&s;e petitions were <Q>hatched by a few warm mi&s;&s;ionaries in the provinces of <HI>New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI></Q> and that the church people in general, nay, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, are <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to the introduction of bi&s;hops into <HI>America? An&s;.</HI> His own <HI>infallibility.</HI>&mdash;The reader may pur&s;ue this hint at his lei&s;ure: I have a few words more to &s;ay, concerning courts.</P>
<P>No per&s;on that I have heard of, ever propo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of &s;piritual courts in <HI>America:</HI> It is a meer bugbear, with which the <HI>American Whig,</HI> and his <HI>under&s;trappers,</HI> endeavour to frighten the good people of the&s;e colonies. And if the &s;pi|ritual courts in <HI>England,</HI> de&s;erve all the &s;evere things that he has &s;aid of them, I fancy it is owing, neither to the con&s;titu|tion of tho&s;e courts, nor to the judges, but to the lawyers. If any one doubts, whether the common law courts even in this province, are in &s;ome degree of bad e&s;timation, let him a&s;k the people,&mdash;To what is this owing?&mdash;To the judges?&mdash;By no means. They are all of them men of excellent characters, and do honour to the po&s;ts they fill. Is it owing to the con&s;titu|tion of the courts? That cannot be imagined. Is it not there|fore owing to the evil practice of <HI>&s;ome of the lawyers,</HI> that our courts are &s;unk in the opinion of the people? <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>avarice,</HI> will, I pre&s;ume, produce much the &s;ame effects in a <HI>lawyer,</HI> that they do in a <HI>clergyman.</HI> Let tho&s;e among the law|yers who&s;e abilities. integrity, love of ju&s;tice, and contempt of riches, exempt them from the above accu&s;ation,&mdash;let them I &s;ay, expo&s;e the unworthy members of their profe&s;&s;ion, who, by perplexing the plaine&s;t ca&s;es, by artificial delays, and exorbitant demands, have &s;unk an honourable and u&s;eful profe&s;&s;ion into &s;uch a degree of contempt, that in the judgment of the majori|ty of the people of &s;everal counties in a late election, a lawyer was deemed unworthy of a &s;eat in our a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Our <HI>American churchman</HI> affirms that, <Q>It was the violence of a few bigots, that obliged the government to &s;hut up the convocation;</Q>&mdash;at the &s;ame time he allows the meeting in convocation, or &s;ynods, to be <Q>a privilege or right, perhaps e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of the church of Chri&s;t.</Q> This is &s;uch a reflection upon the ju&s;tice of the government, as none but
<PB N="364" REF="010857_0183_0F851E536BA94AB8">a <HI>madman</HI> or a <HI>Whig</HI> would have made.&mdash;There were a <HI>few bigots</HI> in the convocation, therefore the government,&mdash;the <HI>kings of the hou&s;e of Hanover,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>American Whig,</HI> I think, in one of his papers,&mdash;have deprived the <HI>church of England</HI> of <HI>a right e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of the church of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;Can this be true? Would a <HI>Chri&s;tian government,</HI> or a <HI>Chri&s;tian King,</HI> for the fault of a <HI>few men,</HI> deprive <HI>a national church</HI> of <HI>a right e&s;&s;ential to the church of Chri&s;t?</HI> Verily, Mr. <HI>American church|man,</HI> I have more rea&s;on than ever to fear, that your <HI>manners are corrupted by evil communications;</HI> and that your new com|panion, the <HI>American Whig,</HI> has taught you the <Q><HI>&s;curvy trick of lying for,</HI></Q>&mdash;what you may po&s;&s;ibly think,&mdash; <Q><HI>the truth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>American churchman</HI> cen&s;ures the conduct of the clergy, for pre&s;uming to addre&s;s or petition the king upon the &s;ubject of <HI>American bi&s;hops,</HI> without a&s;king leave of the governors of the provinces, of the bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ome of the laity.&mdash;&s;uch I &s;uppo&s;e, as him&s;elf and the <HI>American Whig.</HI>&mdash;Whe|ther this precaution was wholly omitted, or how far it was neg|lected, &s;ome people may hereafter be informed, to their no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment. But I have always under&s;tood, that &s;ubjects of the <HI>crown of England,</HI> have a con&s;titutional right to petition the king for the redre&s;s of their grievances, without a&s;king leave of any per&s;on on earth. Why then may not the clergy exerci&s;e this con&s;titutional right, as well as other &s;ubjects? If it is &s;aid that they are not aggrieved; I reply, that they are as capable of knowing when they are aggrieved, as other people are.&mdash;Is it no grievance to be obliged, at a very con&s;iderable ri&s;k and expence, to cro&s;s the atlantic for orders? Is it no grievance, when a church becomes vacant, to be obliged to wait a year be|fore it can be &s;upplied; oftentimes two or three years, and &s;ome|times eight or ten? Is it no grievance, in ca&s;e a clergyman be|haves di&s;orderly, to have no &s;uperiour to call him to account, nearer than 3000 miles? Is it no grievance, to be deprived of what we really believe to be an apo&s;tolica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rite?&mdash;The&s;e, we think, are grievances, altho' the <HI>American Whig,</HI> and his un|derlings, affect to treat them as trifles. And for the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances, we think we have a right to petition the king; as good a right as any other &s;ubjects have to petition for the re|dre&s;s of &s;uch grievances as they find them&s;elves &s;uffering under.</P>
<P>The <HI>American Whig,</HI> and the <HI>American churchman,</HI> have fre|quently affirmed, that a va&s;t majority of people of all denomi|nations, are violently <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to an <HI>American</HI> epi&s;copate;&mdash;that a majority of the church people are as much again&s;t it as
<PB N="365" REF="010857_0183_0F851E536BA94AB8">others.&mdash;This I will not believe, even tho' his Holine&s;s the <HI>American Whig</HI> &s;hould pawn his infallibility for the truth of it.&mdash;I remember in a late election, the cry of, no bi&s;hop in <HI>New-York,</HI> did <HI>no good</HI> to tho&s;e who maliciou&s;ly bellowed it forth. And in a <HI>neighbouring</HI> county, where the &s;ame faction &s;et up an <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical weathercock</HI> for a candidate; after all his <HI>preaching</HI> and <HI>praying,</HI> the cry of <HI>no bi&s;hop,</HI> had ju&s;t the &s;ame effect as it had in <HI>New-York;</HI>&mdash;nobody minded it.&mdash;Be&s;ides, other people can judge, as well as <HI>American Whigs;</HI> and I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, there are ten people of other denominations, who are willing and de&s;irous of having bi&s;hops in <HI>America,</HI> for one <HI>churchman</HI> that is again&s;t it.</P>
<P>There are many other things in this XIIIth num. of the <HI>Whig,</HI> that are very exceptionable, which I have not room to take notice of. In &s;hort, I doubt whether there is a paper in the nation (ob&s;erve, I include <HI>all the colonies</HI>) of the &s;ize of it, that <HI>contains &s;o many aberrations from the truth,</HI> and from &s;ound rea&s;oning&mdash;ten thou&s;and pardons of the courteous Mr. <HI>Wm. Living&s;ton,</HI> for encroaching &s;o much upon his property, as to make u&s;e of one of his rhetorical flouri&s;hes.</P>
<P>To the honour of the <HI>univer&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> which this writer &s;o foully a&s;per&s;es, it ought to be remembered, (and therefore I repeat it) that the fir&s;t public oppo&s;ition to the arbitrary mea|&s;ures of <HI>king James</HI> the &s;econd, began there; even at the time when he was complimented and flattered by the di&s;&s;enters; who in their ful&s;ome addre&s;&s;es to the king, on account of the uncon|&s;titutional &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the penal laws, &s;tiled the <HI>Roman catho|licks,</HI> their good brethren. An addre&s;s of this kind was &s;ent from the independent teachers of the <HI>town</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in New-England.&mdash;In &s;hort, at this period, the di&s;&s;enters did every Thing in their power to rivet tho&s;e fetters, that the king was forging for the nation, until they found the oppo&s;ition again&s;t him was likely to &s;ucceed; and then they &s;hifted about, not choo&s;ing to be of the lo&s;ing &s;ide; <Q>for the children of this world are wi&s;er in their generation than the children of light.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>following letter privately left at my printer's con|taining demands that I can by no means comply with, un|le&s;s I previou&s;ly obtain the con&s;ent of my con&s;tituents,&mdash;the members of the church in</HI> America;&mdash;<HI>I am con&s;trained to pub|li&s;h, in order that they all may have an opportunity of canva&s;ing it: Not that I &s;hould have dreamed of publi&s;hing a</HI> private let|ter, <HI>had not an utter di&s;ability to comply with the</HI> American Whig's own propo&s;al, <HI>by any other means,</HI> compelled <HI>me to it.
<PB N="366" REF="010857_0184_0F851E542B15A1F0">This mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e for an action which nothing but</HI> ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity <HI>will ever induce a man of</HI> honour, <HI>or even of</HI> com|mon hone&s;ty, to commit.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> AMERICAN WHIG. [Numb. XXII.]</HEAD>
<P>THE American Whig a&s;&s;erts in his fir&s;t number, that Dr. Chandler, and the <HI>convention,</HI> do not want a <HI>primitive Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop.</HI> Upon this Mr. Seabury has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that "the Doctor and the convention (gentle|men at lea&s;t at re&s;pectable as him&s;elf) meaning the author of the Whig, <Q>are in fact accu&s;ed of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;hood and de|ceit, pretending to a&s;k for a bi&s;hop only upon the plan pro|po&s;ed in the appeal, while it is not the primitive Chri&s;tian bi&s;hop they want; <HI>which he,</HI> Mr. Seabury, calls a piece of effrontery and malice.</Q> This gentleman, as re&s;pectable as he is, appears to be &s;o tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, that le&s;s regard is to be paid to his a&s;&s;ertions, &s;ince &s;uch intemperate heat often hurries men into expre&s;&s;ions, which, when compo&s;ed and un|ruffled, they cannot but condemn. But in the &s;ame mi&s;take per|&s;i&s;ts the moderate and candid Dr. Chandler, in the conclu&s;ion of his celebrated tory&mdash;adverti&s;ement. And <HI>Hierocles,</HI> who writes with &s;ingular &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity, repeatedly af|firms, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notable affectation of gravity, that <HI>it is certain the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the convention do want, and de&s;ire only, a true pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> bi&s;hop.</HI> Thus if &s;trong reiterated, and &s;erious a&s;&s;er|tions, will prove it, they are in a fair way of gaining their point. And &s;ince they &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t on the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions, which is undoubtedly, in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, of the la&s;t importance: I &s;hall, in this paper, endeavour to &s;hew, by pointing out &s;undry material differences between the primitive bi&s;hop and the bi&s;hop mentioned by Dr. Chandler, that they cannot expect to &s;ecure the public credit, notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;olemnity of their prote&s;tations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The primitive bi&s;hop was cho&s;en by the people, over whom he was to pre&s;ide: It was by the popular &s;uffrage, that this or that man was appointed to this or that cure; as appears abundantly from the writings of the fathers. And the canons of the primitive church fully recognized this right of the people, to choo&s;e their own bi&s;hop; and declared, that without &s;uch election, they &s;hould not be con&s;idered as bi&s;hops. But the bi&s;hop de&s;cribed by Doctor Chandler in his appeal, is not ex|pected to be cho&s;en by the people, over whom he is to pre&s;ide, but is an officer, for whom <Q>application has lately been made
<PB N="368" REF="010857_0185_0F851E54E09D0790">to our &s;uperiors by the clergy of &s;everal of the colonies.</Q> He is one for whom addre&s;&s;es have been made to the throne, and earne&s;t &s;olicitations to the &s;overeign from time to time, to ap|point him. Page 50.</P>
<P N="2">2d. There was one or more primitive bi&s;hop or bi&s;hops in every city, or town, where Chri&s;tianity was profe&s;&s;ed. The apo&s;tle Paul appointed, that there &s;hould be elders or bi&s;hops ordained in every city, or town, of the <HI>i&s;land of Crete.</HI> And tho' <HI>Crete</HI> was but an i&s;land, yet being very fruitful, it &s;up|ported many inhabitants; and is celebrated for its hundred ci|ties. Thus, according to the apo&s;tle's direction, there were to be in this one i&s;land many bi&s;hops. Nor was there any thing pe|culiar in the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e i&s;landers, that rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to have more bi&s;hops there than el&s;ewhere. It was the common practice of the primitive church to have bi&s;hops thus numerous, and thick &s;ettled, as appears from the mo&s;t antient eccle&s;ia&s;tical records: The fathers often mentioning &s;everal hun|dreds, on various occa&s;ions, convening together, in different countries. But the Doctor's bi&s;hop is to pre&s;ide over not only a great number of towns, but of colonies and provinces. He frankly acknowledges, that <HI>three bi&s;hops on the continent are the mo&s;t that have been mentioned.</HI> 107. Thus every town was, in the primitive times, to have a bi&s;hop or bi&s;hops; but three bi&s;hops can now pre&s;ide over a va&s;t tract of country of near 2000 miles in extent, from <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to <HI>Georgia.</HI> The primitive bi&s;hops were <HI>to feed the flock which was among them.</HI> But this gentleman's bi&s;hop is to feed tho&s;e who are di&s;tant from him, fifty, a hundred, or a thou&s;and miles; or rather not to feed them at all. For,</P>
<P N="3">3d. According to primitive in&s;titution, Bi&s;hops were to be apt to teach, and to take heed to all the flock&mdash;to feed the church of God. But Doctor Chandler's bi&s;hop is not to be a con&s;tant preacher; nor, as far as I can learn from him, to preach the go&s;pel at all. How then &s;hould he feed the flock? And, if he &s;hould even preach, how can he feed flocks &s;o numerous and re|mote? &mdash;But his bu&s;ine&s;s is not with the flock, but chiefly with the clergy, as if they were &s;uch a di&s;orderly &s;et of men, as peculiarly to require a bi&s;hop to keep them in tolerable regula|tion. But if this be true, how does it agree with the &s;ociety's ab&s;tract, 1765. p. 58, in which they inform us, <Q>Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> mi&s;&s;ionary, at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> takes occa&s;ion, from &s;ome re|flections ca&s;t on the mi&s;&s;ionaries, to bear the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony to their unblameable conduct; of whom he thinks he may with truth &s;ay, that he does not know of any one mi&s;&s;ionary in New-England, who does not behave with mini&s;terial pru|dence;
<PB N="369" REF="010857_0185_0F851E54E09D0790">and who is not blamele&s;s in his life, and faithful i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the di&s;charge of all the duties of his function.</Q> Can a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> equal good character be given, with truth, of the inferior clerg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in England or Ireland, who are under the immediate eye o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|their bi&s;hops?&mdash;And &s;ince the mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;u&s;tain &s;o un&s;ullied a reputation, can there be any nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ending a prelate into this country to govern them? Such a &s;uperior may make them wor&s;e, but there is no probability of his making them better.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The primitive bi&s;hop was to di&s;cipline all offenders; <HI>&s;uch as &s;inned before all, they were to rebuke before all, that others al&s;o might &s;ear; and to reject H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reticks after the fir&s;t and &s;econd admonition.</HI> The&s;e are directions given to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> by the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> whom the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es to have been primitive bi&s;hops. Page 6. But according to his ac|count, of his American bi&s;hop, he is not to di&s;cipline the laity at all; no, not &s;o much as to make any attempts of this nature. It is only with regard to the clergy that it is propo&s;ed, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a &s;trict di&s;cipline. Page 31.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The bi&s;hop whom our author mentions, and whom he profe&s;&s;es that he and the convention de&s;ire, is a gentleman who&s;e coming he repre&s;ents to have been hindered by the changes of gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnment&mdash;the revolutions of power&mdash;the oppo&s;ition of contending parties at home&mdash;the intrigues of foreign courts&mdash;and the attacks of neighbouring kingdoms and &s;tates, &amp;c. But &s;uch occurrences were no ob&s;tacles to the &s;ettlement of primitive bi&s;hops in the apo&s;tles' time. We hear of no &s;uch complaints in the new te&s;tament. The oppo&s;ition of contend|ing parties in the Roman empire, &amp;c. did not prevent the apo&s;tles from appointing Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops.</P>
<P N="6">6th. The bi&s;hop of the appeal is to be a grand per&s;onage, for who&s;e &s;upport and dignity, great preparations have been made, and are &s;till making; and after all, the Doctor is not certain they will be &s;ufficient, without <HI>a general tax of four-pence in the</HI> &pound; 100. P. 107. He &s;hews that a committee has been extraor|dinarily appointed, to find out ways and means for the mainte|nance and &s;upport of bi&s;hops in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;That eight hun|dred and twenty-&s;ix pounds, &s;even &s;hillings and five pence &s;terl. hath been expended in purcha&s;ing and repairing a &s;eat for the re&s;idence of his <HI>American</HI> lord&s;hip&mdash;that it has been propo&s;ed that the revenues of certain lands in St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> be appli|ed to this purpo&s;e, viz. the maintenance of two bi&s;hops&mdash; that a fund has been appropriated for this end, which already con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal thou&s;and pounds &s;terling (probably not le&s;s than ten)&mdash;And that as many have given liberally, on the
<PB N="370" REF="010857_0186_0F851E55A4DB1EA0">di&s;tant pro&s;pect of its being wanted, it is not to be doubted but, if a bi&s;hop or two were once fixed in America, others would make &s;till larger donations. The&s;e, in all probability, will make a very con&s;iderable revenue. And yet the Doctor &s;eems to think, all this may not be &s;ufficient; and therefore grants there may be a <HI>four penny tax</HI> laid on all the inhabitants; and certainly he was not di&s;po&s;ed to cede any thing, to the di&s;advantage of his cau&s;e, unle&s;s he has great rea&s;ons to force him to believe it was intended to be taken into the &s;cheme of the epi&s;copate. Now this <HI>four penny tax</HI> on all the inhabitants, as trifling as he is plea&s;ed to re|pre&s;ent it, would make a prodigious &s;um. But were there any &s;uch preparations made, and funds provided for the maintenance of the primitive Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops? Was it by any divine in&s;titu|tion appointed, that bi&s;hops mu&s;t be thus rich and magnificent? Are great wealth and &s;uperb palaces nece&s;&s;ary prerequi&s;ites to a primitive bi&s;hop? Where is the divine command, or primitive example, of &s;o grand a prelate? What example could &s;uch a bi&s;hop &s;et his poor flock, &s;ave that of pride, ambition, the love of the world, and temporal pomp and grandeur?</P>
<P>Let the impartial reader duly con&s;ider the preceding remarks, and then &s;ay, whether there be not an evident and e&s;&s;ential dif|ference, between a truly primitive Chri&s;tian bi&s;hop, and the lordly eccle&s;ia&s;tic de&s;cribed by our candid appellant? Is there no difference between one who is voluntarily cho&s;en by the people, who&s;e capacity and fidelity they have tried, and can confide in, and one impo&s;ed on them by the &s;tate, of whom they know no|thing? Is there no difference between liberty and &s;lavery? Is it not a privilege for the people to choo&s;e their own bi&s;hops? Why then did Chri&s;t, the great king and head of the church, confer it upon them; Why did the primitive Chri&s;tians &s;o highly prize it? Why &s;o earne&s;tly contend for it?&mdash;Is there no differ|ence between having a bi&s;hop or bi&s;hops in every town, and but one or two on this va&s;tly&mdash;extended continent? Is there no difference between a bi&s;hop who feeds the flock, and takes heed to them all, and one who does not feed them, nor take any care of them, being wholly employed about the clergy? Is there no difference between one who faithfully admini&s;ters the de&s;cipline appointed in the go&s;pel, to all the proper &s;ubjects of it, and one who will not &s;o much as attempt to di&s;cipline any of the people, be their offences what they will? Is there no differ|ence between a per&s;onage of &s;uch immen&s;e wealth, of &s;uch dig|nity and grandeur, as to eclip&s;e the governors of provinces, and &s;trike the populace wherever he approaches, with greater dread and reverence than the &s;upreme magi&s;trate; and the hum|ble
<PB N="371" REF="010857_0186_0F851E55A4DB1EA0">and lowly bi&s;hop of the primitive church? If a man can &s;ee no difference between them, he mu&s;t labour under a tory-jaun|dice, or be totally blind.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts have not as yet, that I know of, made any ob|jections again&s;t the epi&s;copalians' having primitive bi&s;hops. Such I believe would give no umbrage to per&s;ons of other denomina|tions. The <HI>Moravians</HI> have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hop; the <HI>Sandimanians</HI> have, or lately had, their bi&s;hop at <HI>Danbury</HI> in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Has there been any alarm in the colonies? No. And the epi&s;co|palians may have, I doubt not, a thou&s;and primitive bi&s;hops, without any mole&s;tation. They may make every mi&s;&s;iona|ry a bi&s;hop, without giving any &s;ort of unea&s;ine&s;s to the colo|nies, provided they adhere to the primitive pattern.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, that Dr. Chandler and Mr. Seabury, <HI>Ari&s;tocles</HI> and <HI>Hierocles,</HI> have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to make &s;uch clamour about con&s;cience. For what is it that they plead con|&s;cience in this affair? Is it for a primitive bi&s;hop in every town, to preach to his people, and feed his flock with the &s;incere milk of the word, and di&s;cipline di&s;orderly members? Who has ever oppo&s;ed this? Will they &s;olemnly declare, that they are con&s;ci|entious in de&s;iring a bi&s;hop of &s;uch immen&s;e wealth, power and grandeur, as to be able to protect and defend them? Let them produce the divine rule that lays any obligation on-their con&s;ci|ences, to reque&s;t &s;uch an un&s;criptural officer as this grand, opu|lent, powerful, &s;piritual lord, and we cordially acquie&s;ce. Nor have they hitherto given any &s;ecurity, that this &s;ame &s;tate-cre|ated political bi&s;hop &s;hall not a&s;pire even after greater dignity and dominion than the Doctor has been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign him at his fir&s;t arrival. Will they promi&s;e he &s;hall not? But who is authorized to oblige either him or them to perform tho&s;e promi|&s;es? This &s;ame order of men have promi&s;ed, as fair as po&s;&s;ible, at two memorable periods,&mdash;the re&s;toration and revolution. But as &s;oon as they got into power, they affected to forget all their engagements, and utterly refu&s;ed to fulfil them. Let them remember this, and learn from their former conduct, what little regard is to be paid to their mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations. R.</P>

<P>I HAVE long remained a &s;ilent &s;pectator of tho&s;e commontions which de&s;igning men have been endeavouring to excite a|mong you. A regard to your welfare, and a dote&s;tation of &s;uch iniquitous attempts, forbid me any longer to keep &s;i|lence. The well-being of religion, is productive of well-being to the &s;tate, and con&s;equently to every individual. Can tho&s;e men then be your friends, who are, and have ever been, endea|vouring to prejudice the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, and to bring its mini&s;ters into di&s;grace? I appeal to every man who&s;e judg|ment is guided by rea&s;on, not by prejudice, whether the author of tho&s;e inflammatory papers <HI>(the Whigs)</HI> &s;eem not rather to be heated with the fire of intemperate animo&s;ity, than glowing with the pure flame of patrioti&s;m! Why el&s;e this a&s;&s;iduity to rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions and envyings in the minds of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed church? Why all the&s;e wanderings from the di|rect tract of the &s;ubject, to point out the blemi&s;hes of church|men? This &s;tudious inqui&s;ition to extract poi&s;on from every lux|uriancy?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor.</NOTE> "Charity hopeth all things, believeth all things.</P>
<P>Attend, my countrymen, to the merits of the cau&s;e, without being infatuated with the &s;yren voice of &s;ophi&s;try, or the intox|icating breath of calumny!&mdash;Prejudice, like love, is blind to the blemi&s;hes of the &s;ubject it admires.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="010857_0189_0F851E57E301EA00">
The members of the church of England in America, e&s;teem|ing them&s;elves (as loyal &s;ubjects of the crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>) ju&s;tly entitled to the liberties and privileges which are granted to every other denomination, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho&s;e privileges which are e&s;&s;ential to her well-being, and without which &s;he con&s;iders her government as lax, irregular, and defective; humbly &s;upplica|ted their &s;uperiors that the&s;e inconveniencies might be removed, and their church thereby be &s;upply'd without difficulty, with clergymen ordained after that mode which they e&s;teem pure&s;t; and their youth enjoy the apo&s;tolical rite of confirmation. The&s;e advantages, (as con&s;equences of obtaining an epi&s;copate &s;o circum&s;cribed in it's powers as to be incapable of injuring others) they &s;till entertain rea&s;onable expectations of receiving, both from the favourable reception of their petitions,&mdash; from the ju&s;tne&s;s of the reque&s;t, and the prior movements of their governors to the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>Tho' they flatter'd them&s;elves, their countrymen could have no objections to &s;o rea&s;onable a demand&mdash;a demand founded on liberty of con&s;cience, and tho&s;e rights which are bequeathed them by magna charta, the riche&s;t donation of their forefathers! the fir&s;t article of which declares&mdash; <Q>The church of England &s;hall be free, and have her rights entire, and her liberties un|infringed;</Q>&mdash;Yet that their countrymen might not enter|tain the lea&s;t di&s;content or &s;u&s;picion, they explain'd the plan with the mo&s;t &s;tudied openne&s;s&mdash;avoided every appearance of har&s;hne&s;s, and con&s;ider'd the objections that had been offer'd, with the greate&s;t mildne&s;s and temper; and propo&s;ed examining any others that &s;hould ari&s;e, with decency and charity.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you to reflect, like men con&s;cious of the advantage of Chri&s;tian unanimity, what have been the con&s;equences of the&s;e candid proceedings.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Chandler,</HI> and the convention, were accu&s;ed of fal&s;e|hood&mdash;of not de&s;iring a bi&s;hop under the re&s;trictions they declared.&mdash;What proof was alledg'd in confirmation of &s;o blackening, &s;o weighty a charge? Not one! indeed I would ap|peal to the lea&s;t di&s;cerning of my fellow citizens, whether men, in their &s;ituation, would thus convict them&s;elves of &s;o apparent a fal&s;ehood, by publickly profe&s;&s;ing they de&s;ir'd bi&s;hops &s;o limit|ed, and petitioning for them in the full enjoyment of their pow|ers.&mdash;Such an allegation brands them at once with the cha|racter of the greate&s;t villains, and &s;imple&s;t fools.</P>
<P>Your attention has al&s;o been pall'd with &s;ophi&s;tical and unna|tural interpretations of &s;entences&mdash;by words tortured into un|lawful meanings, and then cha&s;tiz'd for being &s;o. And a certain gentleman, once deemed peerle&s;s in erudition, (has, to the &s;or|row
<PB N="377" REF="010857_0189_0F851E57E301EA00">of his friends, the a&s;toni&s;hment of his enemies, and the great diver&s;ion of you, the public) employed that time which might have been better &s;pent in the &s;ervice of his country, in elaborately &s;pinning from his almo&s;t exhau&s;ted brain, well wrought exhibitions of cobweb-wit.&mdash;But unfortunately! they have been &s;o delicately thin and tender, that they have fal|len to pieces at the lea&s;t touch of examination, and been &s;adly di&s;order'd and di&s;compos'd by the rude breath of enquiry.</P>
<P>In order to rai&s;e your re&s;entment again&s;t the clergy of the church, they have endeavoured to make Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> accu&s;e other denominations of di&s;affection to the crown of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> To effect this, they quote a &s;entence from a paragraph of his appeal, where, inve&s;tigating the cau&s;es which might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppos'd to operate, again&s;t the appointment of an American epi&s;copate, the Doctor &s;aith as follows; <Q>Our condition &s;eems to imply, and &s;trangers may conclude from it, that there has been &s;omething gro&s;sly ami&s;s, and unprecedented in our be|haviour, which has brought down upon us the di&s;plea&s;ure of our &s;uperiors, from whom we might otherwi&s;e expect, at lea&s;t, that common protection and indulgence, which is &s;o generou&s;|ly and properly afforded to all others. But while we thus &s;uf|fer, we are not apprehen&s;ive that it can be owing to the di&s;|plea&s;ure of our &s;uperiors, as we are con&s;cious of no crimes, with regard to the &s;tate. On the other hand, we claim a right to be con&s;ider'd as equal with the foremo&s;t in every due expre&s;&s;ion of fidelity and loyalty.&mdash;No trumpet of Sedition was ever heard to &s;ound from our pulpits.&mdash;No &s;eeds of di&s;affection have been &s;uffered more privately to be &s;own in our hou&s;es.</Q> The la&s;t &s;entence of this paragraph has been &s;tretch'd to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; but I am confident that none who confiders the whole tenor and intent of it, can be thus im|po&s;ed on: However, let me illu&s;trate the innocency of it by a familiar in&s;tance. Should a number of men be allow'd the en|joyment of certain privileges, on condition they were obedient to a law enjoin'd, and a part of them, by &s;ome means or other, remain unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e privileges,&mdash;and they, in order to obvi|ate any &s;urmi&s;es of their &s;ufferings being occa&s;ioned by a breach of the condition &s;tipulated, &s;hould (endeavouring to vindicate their innocency to the world) a&s;&s;ert <Q>They were equal in fidelity to the foremo&s;t of their neighbours,&mdash;That they had never publickly or privately tran&s;gre&s;s'd the law in que&s;tion;</Q> could &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions be ever interpreted as injurious to their neighbours? No! common &s;en&s;e, in &s;pite of the &s;ophi&s;try of mi&s;repre&s;entation, mu&s;t determine, they are con&s;entaneous with their duty to their neighbours and them&s;elves. But the para|graph
<PB N="378" REF="010857_0190_0F851E59748ED580">of the doctor needed not this vindication; for any man who takes a cur&s;ory view of the appeal, will find a &s;ufficient re|futation of all the invidious inferences which malice might be inclin'd to draw from it, in a note at the bottom of the page,&mdash; wherein he &s;ays, <Q>This declaration is not intended to imply any accu&s;ation of others.&mdash;His maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects of all denominations, belonging to the old colonies, have always profe&s;s'd &s;entiments of loyalty; and the author be|lieves they have generally been &s;incere in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions.</Q> Nothing certainly could have been more honourable and gene|rous than this declaration: It might (one would have imagin'd) have &s;ilenced their cen&s;ure, tho' it were ineffectual to conciliate their gratitude.&mdash;But remember, &s;erpents will turn the &s;weet|e&s;t fruits into poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Another method which the&s;e enemies of peace, have taken to rai&s;e an odium again&s;t the church and her clergy is, to di&s;gorge their invectives of "per&s;ecution,"&mdash;of the <Q>Terrors of excommunication,</Q>&mdash;and the power of a bi&s;hop's <Q>pa&s;to|ral &s;taff.</Q> &amp;c. When I dare affirm, and they mu&s;t be con|vinced them&s;elves, that they can produce no recent in&s;tances of the &s;everity they in&s;inuate. Like envy, they ob&s;cure the amia|ble and magnify the di&s;agreeable &s;ide of characters. They de|claim on ob&s;olete laws, enacted in times when univer&s;al bitter|ne&s;s prevail'd; forgetting the moderation which now diffu&s;es it|&s;elf; and drawing the picture of the pre&s;ent church after the image of it in the days of popery. The Engli&s;h bi&s;hops have, for a long cour&s;e of years, behav'd in the exerci&s;e of their au|thority with &s;uch mildne&s;s and complacency, as to extract prai&s;e even from the di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves. Doctor George Ben&s;en, an eminent di&s;&s;enter, makes this open acknowledgment.&mdash; <Q>The church of England with its pre&s;ent candour, &s;pirit of toleration and charity, appears to me, to be the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment on the face of the earth.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>D. E. Jablon&s;ki,</HI> an un|prejudic'd foreigner, in a letter to Dr. <HI>Nicholls,</HI> from <HI>Berlin,</HI> among other things in favour of the church. writes thus,&mdash;On <Q>account al&s;o of her government, among all the reformed church|es, &s;he comes neare&s;t to the pattern of the primitive church, and is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed the brighte&s;t &s;tar in the Chri&s;tian heaven; the chief glory of the reformation; and the &s;ecure&s;t defence of the go&s;pel again&s;t popery; and no one can refu&s;e her communion without &s;chi&s;m. Yet I &s;o follow and honour the church of England, as not to hate, but pity your Pre&s;by|terians; the greater part of whom, I believe, trained up in
<PB N="379" REF="010857_0190_0F851E59748ED580">hereditary prejudices, act with a good con&s;cience; but &s;ome among them abu&s;e the &s;implicity of the re&s;t.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relation des me&s;ures qui furent pri&s;es dans les annees <HI>1711, 12, 13,</HI> pour introduire la liturgie anglicane dans le Royaume de Pru&s;&s;e et dans electorat de Hanover, p. <HI>46, 47.</HI></NOTE> There was no nece&s;&s;ity however, of appealing to the&s;e te&s;timonies; for let the charity and benevolence of the Engli&s;h clergy, &s;o gene|rou&s;ly di&s;play'd in encouraging, and. a&s;&s;i&s;ting every de&s;ign either for the promotion of literature, the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, redden (it po&s;&s;ible) the cheeks of the&s;e partial inveighers, with a blu&s;h of remor&s;e and con|fu&s;ion!</P>
<P>But if they will &s;till continue to open tho&s;e wounds of our ance&s;tors, which time has mo&s;tly clos'd, let them take care le&s;t men draw the veil of ob&s;curity from the execrable perfidy of their fore-fathers; who, under the colour of obtaining liberty of con&s;cience, perpetrated the mo&s;t impious crimes, and en|deavoured to deprive all other denominations of that ble&s;&s;ing they pretended them&s;elves &s;o much to value. Indeed from the cruel oppo&s;ition of the&s;e their &s;ons to the intere&s;ts of the church, the world has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect they are ready to perform that unequal'd impiety their fathers bound them&s;elves, by the &s;econd article of their &s;olemn league and covenant, to perpetrate.&mdash; <Q>We will (&s;wore they) without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, endeavour the extirpation of popery, prelacy, (that is church govern|ment by arch bi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, &amp;c.) le&s;t we partake in other men's &s;ins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues, and that the lord may be one, and his name one in the three kingdoms.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h worth vol. <HI>5.</HI> p. <HI>478.</HI> Clar, vol. <HI>2.</HI> p. <HI>287.</HI></NOTE> &s;uch are, and were the men, who boa&s;ted &s;o much of love to religious liberty, and in&s;tances more gloomy than this are exhibited in the gla&s;s of hi&s;tory.&mdash; But humanity &s;hudders at the dreary pro&s;pect!</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e objected that the Dr. mentions the plan on which bi&s;hops are to be &s;ent <Q>in a mincing, mumbling, &amp;c. manner;</Q> for an an&s;wer to which I imagine the following extract will be (at pre&s;ent) &s;ufficient. <Q>It has long been &s;ettled by our friends and &s;uperiors at home, and the clergy of this country have often te&s;tify'd their entire approbation and acquie&s;cence therein,&mdash;That the bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, &s;hall have no authority, but purely of a &s;piritual nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the church, and not from the &s;tate. That this authority &s;hall operate only upon the clergy of the church, and not upon the laity nor
<PB N="380" REF="010857_0191_0F851E5A5C383288">di&s;&s;enters of any denomination. That the bi&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the property or privileges of churchmen or di&s;&s;enters.&mdash;That in particular they &s;hall have no concern with the probate of wills, letters of guardian&s;hip and admi|ni&s;tration, or marriage licences, nor be judges of any ca&s;e relating thereto; but that they &s;hall only exerci&s;e the origi|nal powers of their Office as before &s;tated, <HI>i. e.</HI> ordain and govern the clergy, and admini&s;ter confirmation to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it.&mdash;This, without any re&s;ervation or equivo|cation, is the exact plan of an American epi&s;copate which has been &s;ettled at home, and it is the only one on which bi&s;hops have been reque&s;ted in our general or more particular ad|dre&s;&s;es.</Q> <HI>Chand.</HI> App. p. 79.</P>
<P>Another project they have made u&s;e of, to excite a di&s;appro|bation of the &s;cheme propos'd, is malevolently to &s;ugge&s;t that the Dr. and convention, were the fir&s;t and only authors of it. But can the&s;e men be ignorant (or do they imagine your igno|rance equal to their pre&s;umption) that for almo&s;t a century back, renewed in&s;tances have been made from governors of Provinces, mini&s;ters, ve&s;tries, and private per&s;ons, for &s;ettling bi&s;hops in America?&mdash;That the plan of &s;ending them, with tho&s;e a|bridgements of their powers propo&s;ed, has been long con&s;titu|ted. &mdash;That a committee extraordinary has been appointed to find out Ways and means for the maintenance of Bi&s;hops in America.&mdash;That they have already obtained a fund &s;ufficient. &mdash;Whoever would be more certified of this truth, will find it clearly &s;tated in the ab&s;tract of the &s;ociety's proceedings in 1713, 1714,&mdash;in an an&s;wer to Dr. Mayhew's ob&s;ervations,&mdash; and in Doctor Chandler's appeal.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why the &s;cheme has not before this been carried into execution, may po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;crib'd to the commotions that immediately after di&s;turb'd the nation,&mdash;the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s which engro&s;s'd the attention of our &s;uperiors;&mdash;but more probably to the neglect of the mi&s;&s;ionaries in not making repeat|ed urgent addre&s;&s;es:&mdash;For by the earne&s;tne&s;s and zeal of their petitions, the government we may &s;uppo&s;e would, in a great mea&s;ure, judge of the nece&s;&s;ity and urgency of the ca&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Silence in &s;uch a &s;tate would be mo&s;t criminal!</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and other in&s;tances (which I &s;hall hereafter fully con&s;ider) you may determine the candour, and honour of the&s;e boa&s;ted defenders of your religious liberties. <HI>Latent angues in herba&mdash;&s;uge! longe &s;age!</HI> The man who errs thro' ignorance is to be pitied; but no character is more to be dete&s;ted than his, who knowingly errs, and willingly leads others into error.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DR. Chandler tells us in his adverti&s;ement, <Q>that the ap|peal was written with real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s&mdash; that he neither knows, nor believes, nor &s;u&s;pects, that he has mi&s;repre&s;ented a &s;ingle fact.</Q> It is extremely di&s;a|greeable to me to di&s;credit the word of any gentlemen, where it can po&s;&s;ibly be avoided. But I cannot compliment away my rea&s;on and con&s;cience to plea&s;e any man. I therefore freely de|clare, that I believe he has mi&s;repre&s;ented many facts; and am willing to lay before the tribunal of the public, &s;ome of the rea&s;ons of this my belief. In the 30th and 31&s;t pages of the ap|peal he writes thus, <Q>The power of the church is of a &s;piritual nature, and the utmo&s;t effect of it in this world is the cutting off, and rejecting, tho&s;e members, which are incurably and dangerou&s;ly corrupted. This puni&s;hment, which has been commonly known by the name of <HI>excommunication,</HI> however it was dreaded in the pure&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity has lo&s;t much of its force in this; wherein altars are &s;et up again&s;t altars, and churches again&s;t churches, and tho&s;e who are rejected by one, may be received by another.&mdash;The charge of prie&s;t|craft, &s;o long hackney'd by infidels and libertines, would be &s;ure to fall upon the clergy, &s;hould they have courage to &s;peak up in defence of it. In this &s;tate of things, the re&s;toration of the primitive di&s;cipline &s;eems to be a matter rather to be wi&s;h|ed for, than &s;eriou&s;ly attempted, by tho&s;e in authority. Ac|cordingly no attempts of this nature will be made, under an American epi&s;copate; the di&s;cipline of the church, &s;o far as it relates to the private members, will be left as it is, and no|thing farther will be done, than refu&s;ing the communion to di&s;orderly and &s;candalous per&s;ons, which every clergyman may now refu&s;e, and ought to refu&s;e according to the ru|bricks.</Q> This whole account I take to be a very great mi&s;|repre&s;entation of the matter, notwith&s;tanding the real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which, the Dr. a&s;&s;ures us, it was written, and that for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Excommunication in the church of England, expo&s;es
<PB N="382" REF="010857_0192_0F851E5B07E312D0">tho&s;e who are the unhappy &s;ubjects of it, to many and great temporal inconveniencies, and grievous hard&s;hips. They are not allowed to commence an action at law; nor to be a witne&s;s, advocate, or juror; nor to make a will; nor be an executor; nor to receive Chri&s;tian burial. Is it not then a mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion of this matter to a&s;&s;ert, <Q>that the power of the church is of a &s;piritual nature; and that the utmo&s;t effect of it in this world is the cutting off, and rejecting, tho&s;e members, which are incurably and dangerou&s;ly corrupted?</Q> This may be true of the church of Chri&s;t, according to her primitive con&s;titution. But who can believe it is true of the church of England? does he mean to adopt the di&s;tinction that has &s;ometimes been made, between the church of England and the church of Chri&s;t? Or does he think that all &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be literally cut off, de&s;troyed, and murdered?</P>
<P N="2">2d. The rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns why church di&s;cipline and excom|munication has lo&s;t much of its force, in the pre&s;ent age, is be|cau&s;e <Q>altars are &s;et up again&s;t altars, and churches again&s;t churches;</Q> that is, becau&s;e there are many who do not join in communion with the church of England. But this is con|trary to the account which other writers, of his own church, give of this matter, who are at lea&s;t as learned and hone&s;t, and <HI>&s;erious,</HI> as him&s;elf. The true cau&s;e of the great want of go&s;|pel di&s;cipline in the church of England, and why it has lo&s;t much of its force, we may learn from bi&s;hop Burnet. Hi&s;t. re|form. part iii. p. 330. <Q>The provi&s;o that had pa&s;&s;ed in K. Henry the eighth's time, that continued the canon-law then received in England, till a code of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws was pre|pared (which, tho' attempted and well prepared, was never &s;ettled) has fixed among us many gro&s;s abu&s;es, be&s;ides the dilatory forms of tho&s;e courts, which make all proceedings in them both &s;low and chargeable. This has, in a great mea|&s;ure, enervated all church di&s;cipline." "Di&s;cipline, <HI>&s;ays another,</HI> is lo&s;t, and will not be permitted by the &s;tate, which by virtue of <HI>conge d'elire's, quare impedits, prohibitions,</HI> &amp;c. have made them&s;elves the &s;ole and ultimate judges, not only of all bi&s;hops and churches, but of their excommunications, and every exerci&s;e of their &s;piritual juri&s;diction.</Q> <HI>Ca&s;e of the regal. and pontif.</HI> p. 166. Mu&s;t it not then be a very gro&s;s mi&s;|repre&s;entation of this fact, and an unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ion on other prote&s;tant churches, to lay at their door the weakne&s;s, or rather the want, of di&s;cipline in the church of England; when it is thus ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed by bi&s;hops them&s;elves, to proceed from her pre&s;ent con&s;titution, and clo&s;e alliance with the &s;tate?
<PB N="383" REF="010857_0192_0F851E5B07E312D0">Or is a fal&s;hood the better for being written with great &s;olemni|ty and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P N="3">3d. Another thing which has greatly weakened di&s;cipline in the church of England, is the Sacramental te&s;t, by which all the officers in the army and navy, &amp;c. are obliged to receive the &s;acrament, let their lives and practices be ever &s;o debauched. Indeed Dr. Chandler &s;ays, that, <Q>every clergyman may now refu&s;e, and ought to refu&s;e, the communion to di&s;orderly and &s;candalous per&s;ons, according to the <HI>rubricks.</HI></Q> But then he &s;hould have added, if he would give a full repre&s;entation of the matter, that <Q>an action lies again&s;t the mini&s;ter who &s;hall refu&s;e it to them, tho' he knows, &s;ees, and hears them to be never &s;o unqualified.</Q> <HI>Ca&s;e of the regal, and pontif.</HI> p. 179. The &s;acramental te&s;t, which enjoins it &s;o &s;trictly on all officers to receive, &s;uppo&s;es that the mini&s;ters are obliged to grant them the &s;acrament; and if any mini&s;ter &s;hould dare to refu&s;e it, the officers know where they can have their remedy, in &s;pite of Dr. Chandler and his rubricks. I leave it then to any candid per&s;on, whether he has given a fair repre&s;entation of the di&s;cipline of the church of England, in his appeal; tho' it was written with real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Other prote&s;tant churches do not take it upon them to di&s;cipline tho&s;e who do not profe&s;s to belong to them; &s;o that men's withdrawing from one denomination, and joining them|&s;elves to another, frees them from that church to which they formerly adhered. And Dr. Chandler, &s;eems to repre&s;ent this to be the ca&s;e with the church of England, when he a&s;&s;igns this as the cau&s;e, why excommunication has lo&s;t much of its force, that <Q>churches are &s;et up again&s;t churches, and tho&s;e who are rejected by one may be received by another.</Q> But it is well known, that where the church of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;he con&s;iders all that are born and live within her precincts as &s;ubjects of her di&s;cipline. And the more that any di&s;&s;ent from her wor&s;hip and communion, with the more &s;everity they may expect to be di&s;ci|plined. Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance, that a Pre&s;byterian in England or Ireland commits an offence worthy of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure, and makes proper Chri&s;tian &s;atisfaction, to the acceptance of the Pre&s;byterian church, to which he belongs, yet he may depend upon being cited to the bi&s;hop's court, and forced to pay them their fees, and &s;atisfy their exorbitant demands. And thus, as one expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>after the Pre&s;byterian church has purged them of their &s;candal, the epi&s;copal church purges them of their money.</Q>&mdash;And that the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries in the colonies, have &s;ome imagination of their being inve&s;ted wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power and authority, over all other denominations, is not un|likely.
<PB N="384" REF="010857_0193_0F851E5BA1028FC0">Why el&s;e did Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> the great advocate of their church, addre&s;s letter after letter to his di&s;&s;enting pari&s;hioners? For if they were Di&s;&s;enters from his church, how came they to be his pari&s;hioners?&mdash;Now &s;ince the rulers of the church of England, have not been inclined to be more merciful, but rather more &s;evere to prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, and to cha&s;ti&s;e them with rigour for their &s;candals and refractorine&s;s, how is it po&s;&s;i|ble that Dr. Chandler's account &s;hould be true, that their &s;epa|ration, and erecting other churches, has weakened their di&s;ci|pline? And when the epi&s;copalians have &s;courged prote&s;tant. Di&s;|&s;enters, with &s;uch unmerciful &s;everity, and continue to hara&s;s them in their &s;piritual courts at home, is there not &s;omething very queer in charging them with weakening their di&s;cipline? Ought he not with real and great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s to review this &s;triking mi&s;repre&s;entation?</P>
<P N="5">5. The Dr. &s;ays that <Q>the di&s;cipline of the church, &s;o far as relates to private members, will be le&s;t as it is,</Q> &amp;c. Would not any impartial reader take it from this repre&s;entation, that the church of England had &s;ome proper di&s;cipline, where &s;he is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and that &s;he had &s;ome kind of di&s;cipline, tho' of a le&s;s perfect kind, in the colonies? Mu&s;t it not therefore ap|pear &s;urpri&s;ing, to hear that the church of England her&s;elf confe&s;&s;es &s;he has no godly di&s;cipline, for per&s;ons guilty of noto|tious &s;ins? Thus, <Q>Brethren, in the primitive church there was a godly di&s;cipline, that at the beginning of lent &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;tood convicted of notorious &s;ins, were put to open penance, and puni&s;hed in this world, that their &s;ouls might be &s;aved in the day of the lord; and that others puni&s;hed by this example, might be more afraid to offend. In&s;tead whereof, until &s;aid di&s;cipline be re&s;tored again, which is much to be wi&s;hed for, it is thought good,</Q> &amp;c. Agreeable to this, Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> takes notice, that <Q>the church of England ob&s;erves no church di&s;cipline, and the liturgy it&s;elf teaches them once a year, to wi&s;h the godly di&s;cipline of the primi|tive church re&s;tored.</Q> However they have &s;ub&s;tituted &s;ome|thing el&s;e in its &s;tead. And whether the pro&s;ecutions of their &s;piritual courts, and the oppre&s;&s;ions and harra&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e, who have had the unhappine&s;s to ta&s;te of their mercy, &amp;c. which has prevailed in the mean time, has not been a very un|godly &s;ort of di&s;cipline, is no great difficulty to determine.</P>
<P><Q>But, it may perhaps be &s;aid, we have never known any &s;uch terrible doings in this country.</Q> True; and we have never had any bi&s;hops here. The mi&s;&s;ionaries are only &s;imple pre&s;byters, who, according to the Doctor's &s;cheme, have no right to meddle with the keys of di&s;cipline. <Q>The exemptions,
<PB N="385" REF="010857_0193_0F851E5BA1028FC0">bi&s;hop Burnet, &s;ettled by papal authority, do put many parts of this church in a very disjointed &s;tate; while in &s;ome places the laity, and in others pre&s;byters, exerci&s;e epi&s;copal juri&s;diction independant of their bi&s;hops; in contradiction to their own principles, while they a&s;&s;ert a divine right for &s;et|tling the government of bi&s;hops,</Q> &amp;c. The famous <HI>Cart|wright</HI> was impri&s;oned two years by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Whitgi&s;t,</HI> be|cau&s;e, that being only a pre&s;byter, he had appointed a form of public penance, or &s;atisfaction, for a per&s;on who had been guilty of fornication. I never under&s;tood that the mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;hewed any great di&s;po&s;ition to offend their &s;uperiors, by attempting to meddle with di&s;cipline. What idea then could the Dr. intend to convey, by &s;aying that the di&s;cipline of the church, &s;o far as it relates to private members, will be le&s;t as it is? Is it this important and momentous idea, that, even after the arrival of a bi&s;hop, nothing will be nothing &s;till? Or does he, by the&s;e words, mean to a&s;&s;ure us, that the bi&s;hop will not erect his &s;pi|ritual courts, and bring us under the la&s;h of his ungodly di&s;ci|pline, which is &s;ub&s;tituted by the church of England, in&s;tead of that which obtained in the primitive church! But what au|thority has this poor &s;imple pre&s;byter to controul his &s;uperiors, and to govern and give law to his bi&s;hop? Mu&s;t not this be looked on as arrogance with a witne&s;s?</P>
<P N="6">6th. He &s;eems to lament that <Q>altars are &s;et up again&s;t al|tars, and churches again&s;t churches; and tho&s;e who are re|jected by one, may be received by another.</Q> Who would have imagined that a gentleman, who profe&s;&s;es &s;o much candour and moderation, &s;hould be grieved at the toleration, and repine that others are allowed liberty to wor&s;hip God, according to the go&s;pel and their con&s;ciences? Would he have the penal laws re|vived, and extended to the colonies, and all the churches of other denominations pulled down, and his dear epi&s;copal church erected on their ruins, and all the inhabitants compelled to con|form to her? Will nothing but &s;uch power content the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries? Can they never be ea&s;y, but when they are hara&s;|&s;ing their peaceable neighbours? <Q>Tho&s;e who are rejected by one church, may be received by another.</Q> One would natu|rally think from this, that when the epi&s;copal church among us, was about cen&s;uring and excommunicating &s;candalous &s;inners, other prote&s;tant churches were ready to receive them, and in fact, took them into their communion, and protected them from her di&s;cipline. It is truly a&s;toni&s;hing that the Dr. and his brethren could publi&s;h &s;uch an in&s;inuation as this, in this country, where it is &s;o well known, that the epi&s;copal churches of the mi&s;&s;ionaries are generally fir&s;t founded by, and afterwards re|ceive
<PB N="386" REF="010857_0194_0F851E6182B35C48">a great part of their increa&s;e or additions, from tho&s;e per|&s;ons who refu&s;e to make Chri&s;tian &s;atisfaction, for tho&s;e &s;canda|lous crimes they have committed. This is a common proverb in <HI>New-England,</HI> of any per&s;on who falls into any open notorious &s;in,&mdash;<HI>well, he'll make a churchman now.</HI> Who is there that does not know, that the epi&s;copal churches are a common <HI>recep|tacle,</HI> or <HI>city of refuge,</HI> for di&s;orderly and &s;candalous per&s;ons? It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak thus plain, becau&s;e the Dr. appears to affect ignorance or forgetfulne&s;s in this matter.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>we live in an age when the voice of rea&s;on will not be heard, nor the &s;trength of arguments regarded, altho' &s;up|ported by the declarations of Heaven, on the &s;ubject of church di&s;cipline&mdash;the charge of <HI>prie&s;t-craft,</HI> &s;o long hackneyed by infidels and libertines, would be &s;ure to fall upon the clergy, &s;hould they have courage to &s;peak in defence of it. In this &s;tate of things, the re&s;toration of the primitive di&s;ci|pline, &s;eems to be a matter rather to be wi&s;hed for, and de|&s;ired, than rationally attempted by tho&s;e in authority. Ac|cordingly no attempts of this nature will be made, under an American epi&s;copate.</Q> This is a very extraordinary pa&s;&s;age, upon which I propo&s;e the following queries.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Does it not appear from this pa&s;&s;age, that the epi&s;copal clergy in general, and the mi&s;&s;ionaries in particular, have not courage to &s;peak in defence of the primitive di&s;cipline, tho' they are fully convinced it is &s;upported by the declarations of Heaven? And that we are not to expect any thing better from the bi&s;hop, whom the Dr. and the convention pretend to de&s;ire, for the ve|ry purpo&s;e of this re&s;toration? Is not this to hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and ba&s;ely to betray the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, ac|cording to this plain and hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion which is here made? Can &s;uch a bi&s;hop be a primitive bi&s;hop? Were they intimidated by libertines and infidels?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Whether men, who have &s;o little fidelity and courage to defend, what they profe&s;s to be &s;upported by the declarations of Heaven, as the Dr. repre&s;ents, be worthy the name and cha|racter of the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t? Infidels and libertines do not pretend to believe the go&s;pel, but to con&s;ider it as an impo&s;ture. No wonder they di&s;regard its &s;olemn declarations; this is but acting agreeable to their character. But what &s;hall we think of Chri&s;tians, who profe&s;s to believe it, and yet pay no &s;uitable re|gard to it? What &s;hall we think of tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ume the high character of Chri&s;tian teachers, and yet avow that they will not &s;peak up in defence of the expre&s;s declarations of Heaven? Do &s;uch mini&s;ters and bi&s;hops remember, that they are &s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel? And that when they thus cowardly
<PB N="387" REF="010857_0194_0F851E6182B35C48">de&s;ert their po&s;t, they yield up the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e into the hands of its enemies? Can we rationally expect any benefit from &s;uch mi&s;&s;ionaries, and &s;uch bi&s;hops?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Does Dr. Chandler think, that there are more Libertines and Infidels now, in proportion to the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or the <HI>colonies,</HI> than there were in the time of the pri|mitive church? If there are not, why &s;hould this be alledged as a rea&s;on to neglect church di&s;cipline? Would not this have been a rea&s;on, equally cogent again&s;t its fir&s;t in&s;titution? If it can|not be rationally attempted now, how was it actually effected then? Does not this language of Dr. Chandler, &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;omething in the go&s;pel very ab&s;urd, fooli&s;h and unrea&s;onable, &s;ince it <HI>cannot be rationally attempted by tho&s;e in authority?</HI> Or will be &s;ay the primitive di&s;cipline was not of divine in&s;titution? &mdash;And if it was not, why is it to be wi&s;hed for and de&s;ired? Or is it the recalling of the toleration, and the revival of the penal laws, which he and his brethren wi&s;h and de&s;ire?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the mi&s;&s;ionaries are very &s;incere, in wi&s;hing and de&s;iring the re&s;toration of the primitive di&s;ci|pline, when they are &s;o ready to receive into their churches, all tho&s;e who refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to it in the churches where it is prac|ti&s;ed? and when their increa&s;e &s;o greatly depends upon their want of it? Do not actions &s;peak louder than words?&mdash;</ITEM>

<P>According to him the Whig's account of the origin of Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters is fictitious;&mdash;I &s;hall not make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to pro|duce authorities in its vindication, but adduce the te&s;timony of Squire <HI>T.</HI> him&s;elf to prove, that <HI>his own</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent and therefore erroneous: I will not be confident that it was his own invention; for he had probably &s;ome invi&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>I Fear it may be thought too low a &s;toop for me, even to take notice of the much neglected Sir <HI>I&s;aac Foot;</HI> who notwith|&s;tanding his unparralled in&s;olence and effrontery has hitherto pa&s;s'd unmole&s;ted, thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of weekly papers. I once
<PB N="392" REF="010857_0197_0F851E64CF657B88">heard it &s;aid, that he di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a man of &s;en&s;e, but that he wrote like a fool. Both parts of the a&s;&s;ertion may po&s;&s;ibly be true, tho' I confe&s;s the character of the fool is &s;o &s;triking in his compo&s;itions, that the man of &s;en&s;e is lo&s;t under its glare. His performances might however all have been buri|ed in eternal oblivion, and have peri&s;hed with the name of their doughty author, had he not made a per&s;onal attack upon my friend <HI>Richard Pleadwell;</HI> he it &s;eems, in a&s;&s;uming the honour of contending with Mr. <HI>Peere Williams,</HI> his brother lawyer, has expo&s;ed him&s;elf to to the virulence and rudene&s;s of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Foot;</HI> who in point of politene&s;s and good breeding, is not le&s;s defective, than he is in the knowledge of the &s;ubjects upon which he pre&s;umes to write.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> (under the feigned character of <HI>Obadiah Li&s;ten</HI>) profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to be no lawyer (as I verily believe he is not) and apoligizing at the &s;ame time for his ignorance, wonders that Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI> &s;hould decline replying to an <HI>untruth,</HI> and be ambitious of entering upon the defence of the contrary. In behalf of my friend <HI>Pleadwell,</HI> it might be &s;ufficient to remark, in an&s;wer to this &s;agacious &s;entiment of Sir <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> that law|yers in their pleadings are not bound down to &s;uch nice rules of compo&s;ition, as will bear the piercing eye of &s;o great a critic as he is, who pa&s;&s;es over no imperfection in his adver&s;ary's &s;tyle. Perhaps this a&s;&s;uming knight imagines it to be his prerogative to <HI>Kick</HI> every man he meets with in the road to literary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame at which he is a&s;piring; and it was indeed, Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI>'s mi&s;|fortune to fall in the way of &s;uch a <HI>light footed</HI> antagoni&s;t, in the little excur&s;ion he had made towards Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s imperial ter|ritory.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e he were to be told that lawyers, by a kind of nece&s;&s;i|ty impo&s;ed upon them, are much &s;hackled with forms in their pleadings. That tho' it be true, that the&s;e forms are not al|ways much to the purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t for matter of real &s;ub&s;tance, yet while the lawyer in the cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion is obliged to &s;ubmit to them, Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> may glory in the high privilege and honour of inventing modes of compo&s;ition that are equally life|le&s;s and un&s;ub&s;tantial. The lawyer pleads pre&s;cription an anci|ent U&s;age as his apology; Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> has none but his ignorance. Thus much may &s;uffice to &s;hew, that he has gained nothing by this &s;hrewd remark upon Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI>'s introduction to the replication.</P>
<P>Our valiant knight fir&s;t levels the full weight of his g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ammati|cal artillery, again&s;t an unlucky word that drop'd from Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI>'s pen. What was it? Why he a&s;&s;erted that the ap|peal was not in&s;tituted <HI>merely</HI> for the aggrandizement of the epi&s;|copal
<PB N="393" REF="010857_0197_0F851E64CF657B88">churches on the ruin of all other Chri&s;tian denominations. What a pity was it, that this word <HI>merely,</HI> &s;hould have been thrown out thus to expo&s;e Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI>'s cau&s;e; for does it not turn his argument directly again&s;t him&s;elf? Whatever is not done <HI>merely</HI> for any purpo&s;e, is certainly done in <HI>part</HI> for that purpo&s;e; but the appeal was not in&s;tituted <HI>merely</HI> to aggrandize the church on the ruin of others, therefore it was de&s;igned in <HI>part</HI> to promote &s;uch aggrandizement. Fie upon it, my friend <HI>Pleadwell,</HI> how came you to rea&s;on &s;o unguardedly? Had you te&s;ted your remark by a Syllogi&s;m, the &s;elf-condemning conclu|&s;ion would have &s;tared you in the face, You have given up the point in one &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion; for do you imagine that other Chri&s;tian denominations ought to &s;uffer the church of England to grow, if &s;he &s;tands but one hair's breadth in their way?&mdash; That if di&s;&s;enters think it inconvenient that &s;he &s;hould ri&s;e in plenitude of her &s;trength, they ought not by all means to op|po&s;e her? That if they de&s;ire to grow up, be &s;trong and flouri&s;h them&s;elves, they mu&s;t not be glad to &s;ee the epi&s;copal churches weak, maimed and impotent? That a bi&s;hop if he does no other harm, than that of rendering the terms of admi&s;&s;ion of the clergy into the church, as ea&s;y as tho&s;e of other denomina|tions, will not by this means in part aggrandize the church upon the ruin of others?&mdash;For &s;hould the clergy of the church of England increa&s;e in numbers as the di&s;&s;enting clergy do, might there not &s;oon be as many churchmen as di&s;&s;enters in the coun|try, and would not this weaken and almo&s;t ruin the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t? Should we not &s;ee the plain and humble meeting-hou&s;es, commonly &s;o called (I mean it not by way of deri&s;ion, but di&s;|tinction) &s;hrink beneath the &s;uperb and towering &s;pires of epi&s;|copal churches? Where can all this end, but partly in the ag|grandizement of tho&s;e churches upon the ruin of all others?</P>
<P>Thus Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI> may &s;ee the full force of his own argu|ment, pointed again&s;t him&s;elf. It is not ea&s;y however to be con|ceived, that if &s;uch an accidential aggrandizement of the epi&s;|copal churches as this is, &s;hould take place in con&s;equence of a bi&s;hop's arrival among us, it would be at the expence of one right taken from any other denomination. For is it not rea|&s;onable that the church of England: con&s;idered merely as a &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, &s;hould be cheri&s;hed with the natural and internal &s;uccours of her own &s;trength as derived from her frame and con&s;titution?&mdash;That what is very nece&s;&s;ary to her very being and exi&s;tence, &s;hould at lea&s;t be ea&s;ily attainable? The enjoyment of the&s;e, is and mu&s;t be a perfect right which every church may claim, and is entitled to. All di&s;&s;enters have and exerci&s;e this right within them&s;elves, which they are enabled to
<PB N="394" REF="010857_0198_0F851E656591B8B8">do from their mode of ordination and form of church govern|ment. Were it po&s;&s;ible to turn the tables upon them, and for the church (having the full powers of ordination here) to &s;ay, that the di&s;&s;enters &s;hould not have a &s;ingle clergyman ordained, except he went to England; and that they &s;hould forever be obliged to go there, notwith&s;tanding the means of ordination might ea&s;ily be brought nearer home, would they not complain that we were building up our churches upon the ruin of theirs? And if &s;o, have we not ju&s;t right to make the &s;ame complaint?</P>
<P>Coun&s;ellor <HI>Pleadwell</HI> doubtle&s;s mu&s;t have a high &s;en&s;e of &s;ir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s politene&s;s, in the &s;everal epithets be&s;towed upon him: namely; that of "<HI>Simpleton, &s;tupid petty&s;ogger,</HI> and <HI>fiery zea|lot;</HI>" and in charging the replication with being full of <Q><HI>nau&s;e|ous repetitions,</HI></Q> and comparing it to an <Q><HI>in&s;ipid Cud ekewed ovr and over again.</HI></Q> Such reflections as the&s;e, to a man of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s refined ta&s;te, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have appeared extremely delicate. I confe&s;s my&s;elf unequal in this department to con|tend with him, and mu&s;t therefore leave him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this mean and glorious triumph over his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Having made this di&s;charge from the ebullition of his ill na|ture, he now conde&s;cends to attack Mr. <HI>Pleadwell</HI>'s argument; and this he does in effect, by &s;aying that it matters not whether the church and clergy in their pre&s;ent &s;tate in <HI>America,</HI> are the proper objects of the &s;tatutes refered to by Mr. <HI>Peere Williams;</HI> nor whether the church of <HI>England</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, or not: For that, be this at it will, the conclu&s;ion drawn from the&s;e &s;tatutes remains inconte&s;tible, to wit, <Q><HI>That there actually is no right of epi&s;copacy within the realm of England, except what is derived from human laws.</HI></Q> The Bi&s;hops in <HI>England, &s;ays he,</HI> can confer no other right than they have them&s;elves, therefore any &s;uch right derived from <HI>England,</HI> cannot be more <HI>divine</HI> in <HI>America</HI> than it is there. That is, in other words, it mu&s;t be ju&s;t &s;uch a right as the bi&s;hops have in England, viz, a right merely derived from human laws, with every power that there belongs to the office.&mdash;This to be &s;ure will at once bring the law dignified prelate into our land, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;piritual courts among us,&mdash;The bi&s;hop will &s;pin all the officers of this court out of his very bowels; create a dean and chapter by the breath of his mouth, rear the church hie|rarchy out of nothing, and hold his &s;eat in the American hou&s;e of lords. For all the&s;e are appendages that belong to the exi&s;t|ence of a Briti&s;h bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s mi&s;take lies in confounding things that are in their nature entirely di&s;tinct. The bi&s;hop's right as to his powers of ordination is no more derived from the laws of England, than the apo&s;tle's commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Timothy</HI> to go and preach the go&s;pel,
<PB N="395" REF="010857_0198_0F851E656591B8B8">was&mdash;There are indeed &s;uperadded powers which they claim, founded in the connection which the law has formed between their offices and the &s;tate. But this is adapted to the peculiar policy of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where the church of England makes a branch of the con&s;titution, and perfects the political &s;y&s;tem. Not &s;o here; For where is the theatre upon which their &s;piritual lord&s;hips can exhibit this grand machinery of political power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &mdash;But e&s;pecially if the church of England is not e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, upon what foundation is the bi&s;hop to build the va&s;t &s;tructure of legal eccle&s;ia&s;tical dominion, which at lea&s;t pre|&s;uppo&s;es &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment? Mu&s;t he not in &s;uch ca&s;e, rather of nece&s;&s;ity be like a primitive bi&s;hop in a &s;trange land un&s;up|ported by the &s;ecular arm? Upon this principle the requi&s;ite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for completing the character of a Briti&s;h prelate are wanting; and among the re&s;t, that e&s;&s;ential one, the very legal exi&s;tence of the church it&s;elf.&mdash;Can the branches flouri&s;h, where the tree is not planted; or can power, which is but a mode or qua|lity, be conceived of, without the &s;ubject in which it exi&s;ts?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the church of England really to be e&s;tabli&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, yet it will by no means follow that prelacy in <HI>America,</HI> mu&s;t be accompanied with all the powers that appertain to it in England. &mdash;Our &s;tate and circum&s;tances mu&s;t be like theirs, otherwi&s;e we cannot argue from a parity of rea&s;on in both ca&s;es, and not only the &s;tate of things, but our opinions mu&s;t be fir&s;t entirely changed in America, to favour the introduction of high wrought Briti&s;h prelacy.&mdash;As to my own part, tho' I wi&s;h to &s;ee a pri|mitive bi&s;hop in America, yet I never de&s;ire to behold one cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|thed with civil power, nor would I ever bow the neck to eccle&s;i|a&s;tical tyranny.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t of the performance under con&s;ideration, it is &s;o trifling as not to de&s;erve the lea&s;t notice.

<HEAD>THE AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XXIV.]</HEAD>
<P>DR. Chandler laments the deplorable &s;ituation of the church of England in America, and repre&s;ents, in dole|ful accents, her pre&s;ent &s;tate of grievous oppre&s;&s;ion; from di&s;&s;enters I pre&s;ume he mu&s;t mean, &s;ince he will not &s;ay, her oppre&s;&s;ion is owing to the di&s;countenance of his Maje&s;ty, the parliament, or the Bi&s;hops of England. I confe&s;s it is the fir&s;t in&s;inuation of the kind, that ever I heard; and am confi|dent the Dr. would find it very difficult to &s;upport his com|plaint by a &s;ingle in&s;tance: Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive how this can be the ca&s;e, as the epi&s;copal church is the peculiar ob|ject of protection, in every government where his maje&s;ty hath the appointment of the commander in chief; there not being one king's government on this continent, who&s;e governor is not a member of her communion. On the other hand, that the di&s;&s;enters have been oppre&s;&s;ed by the church of England in America, abundant proof may be adduced; and le&s;t this &s;hould be thought a groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion, it may not be ami&s;s to pro|duce a few in&s;tances. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter that over apply'd for a licen&s;e, to preach in New-Yor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was pe|remptorily refu&s;ed permi&s;&s;ion; and afterwards underwent the hard&s;hip of a &s;evere impri&s;onment, for no other crime than that of preaching the go&s;pel in a private hou&s;e, to a few people of his own per&s;ua&s;ion.&mdash;The a&s;&s;embly of that province, at a time when the church of England had no exi&s;tence in it, and when more than nine tenths of the members were di&s;&s;enters, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a provi&s;ion, for the &s;upport of a prote&s;tant mini&s;try, in &s;eve|ral of the counties; plainly de&s;igning it for any prote&s;tant mi|ni&s;try. Of this provi&s;ion, the church of England very &s;oon
<PB N="397" REF="010857_0199_0F851E662D98CE48">artfully avail'd her&s;elf, and has ever &s;ince appropriated the &s;ame, to the exclu&s;ive maintenance of her own clergy, tho' nine tenths at lea&s;t of the money rai&s;ed by the act i&s;&s;ues from the e&s;tates of people of other denominations. A &s;triking proofs, truly of the boa&s;ted equity and ju&s;tice of that church, in draw|ing from di&s;&s;enters a &s;upport of a religious con&s;titution which they con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;approve and renounce!&mdash;In this province al&s;o, a|bout forty years ago, the epi&s;copalians, with open violence, &s;eized upon a pre&s;byterian church and par&s;onage, of which they kept ille|gal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the &s;pace of twenty years. The&s;e are a few of the many in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;&s;enters have experienced in this province. In Virginia, where the church hath a gene|ral provincial e&s;tabli&s;hment, loud have been the complaints of per&s;ecution, which the epi&s;copalians have exerci&s;ed towards pro|te&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, who&s;e mini&s;ters, for the attrocious crime of preaching the go&s;pel, have there been frequently harra&s;&s;ed, and cited before courts and magi&s;trates, and refu&s;ed even the privi|leges of the toleration-act. Tho' this may &s;eem a digre&s;&s;ion from the &s;ubject of an American Bi&s;hop, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate di&s;&s;enters, from the unju&s;t in&s;inuations contained in Dr. Chandler's pamphlet; and to &s;hew from what quarter re|ligious oppre&s;&s;ions, in the&s;e colonies, have heretofore ari&s;en.</P>
<P>The Dr. urges the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of an American epi&s;|copate, to rai&s;e the church of England from that &s;tate of deplo|rable oppre&s;&s;ion, under which &s;he hath &s;o long groaned, to &s;up|port her dignity, and advance her growth in the American co|lonies. But I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that any man, who has re&s;ided but a few years in this country, and e&s;pecially a native, who cannot but be thoroughly acquainted with the genius and di&s;|po&s;ition of its inhabitants towards an eccle&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et him&s;elf to urge a mea&s;ure, that hath &s;o ma|nife&s;t a tendency to interrupt the peace, impede the population, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">-inkindle a flame in his Maje&s;ty's North-American domi|nions.&mdash;How warm a friend &s;oever &s;uch an advocate may be, to the <HI>religious</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment in England, he certainly acts the par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">an enemy to the civil intere&s;t of his &s;overeign and coun|try. The greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealot for epi&s;copacy among us, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the unconquerable aver&s;ion of nine tenths at lea&s;t of his countrymen (among whom are great numbers of the church laity them&s;elves) to the introduction of Bi&s;hops, under any pretended primitive form. Were it even po&s;&s;ible to procure a dignitary of the church of England, clothed with tho&s;e pri|mitive epi&s;copal powers only, with which the Dr. tells us he is to come inve&s;ted; and were he to make his fir&s;t appearance in the garb of the inoffen&s;ive &s;heep; it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di|ve&s;t
<PB N="398" REF="010857_0200_0F851E66EA281958">Americans, who&s;e ance&s;tors have felt and fled from the ty|ranny of tho&s;e holy men, from the apprehen&s;ion of their &s;oon becoming devouring wolves. But how artfully would the&s;e gentlemen impo&s;e upon the credulity of the people, by &s;uppo|fing a Bi&s;hop of the church of England, will be &s;ent to Ameri|ca thus deplumed of the nece&s;&s;ary and in&s;eparable appendages, annexed to the epi&s;copal office in the Engli&s;h hierarchy, by the common and &s;tatute law, from the origin of its con&s;titution. The king and parliament, under who&s;e forming hand that church ro&s;e into exi&s;tence, mu&s;t entirely new-frame and model her con&s;titution, before a bi&s;hop, of the antient primitive Chri&s;tian &s;tamp, can emerge from her bo&s;om. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Briti&s;h parliament (who&s;e wi&s;dom we pre&s;ume will ever pre|vent them from pro&s;ecuting a mea&s;ure, that appears to have &s;o unfriendly an a&s;pect upon his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t in the colonies) &s;hould con&s;titute and American epi&s;copate, and, in an e&s;pecial manner, &s;hould preclude his lord&s;hip from <HI>tythes,</HI> from holding eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and the exerci&s;e of any &s;piritual power but that of ordination, confirmation, and government of the cler|gy&mdash;yet will not this primitive, this inoffen&s;ive ecole&s;i|a&s;tic, be con&s;tituted a member of his Maje&s;ty's council, where he &s;hall happen to be re&s;ident? And who, not wilfully blind, does not &s;ee what an influence this would give him, when &s;trengthened with an intere&s;t in the whole bench of the &s;piritual lords? Ever intent on aggrandizing their great Diana, and ex|tending their hierarchy, by the conver&s;ion of prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to their favourite idol epi&s;copacy (&s;olid piety being an object of &s;ubordinate con&s;equence) With &s;uch zealous and powerful coadjutors, what will his lord&s;hip want, but an a&s;cendancy in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, in order to procure epi&s;copal e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, with the ample&s;t annua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">evenues, throughout every county. Nor will he be able to &s;upport the dignity of his eccle|&s;ia&s;tical character, and the expence of his epi&s;copal equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age, with le&s;s than three thou&s;and per annum, in addition to the &s;mall allowance, with which it is probable he would appear among us. Under the&s;e views of a bi&s;hop (and the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the views of nine tenths of the coloni&s;ts) the introduction of his lord&s;hip into America, would throw the people into convul&s;ions, greater than tho&s;e which the late &s;tamp-act occa&s;ioned, by &s;o much more as they e&s;teem their religious liberties, of more im|portance than their civil. How unfriendly then are the advo|cates for the mea&s;ure, to the tranquility of this country, who de&s;ire (and they cannot but de&s;ire it, as they mu&s;t be convinced it would be the unavoidable con&s;equence) to &s;ee the confu&s;ions and di&s;orders of the year 1765
<PB N="399" REF="010857_0200_0F851E66EA281958">repeated; for I am confident the generality of the people would more quietly &s;ubmit to three &s;tamp-acts, than to the exertion of the Engli&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tical hierarchy, in the&s;e regions of un&s;hack|led religious liberty. To avoid the oppre&s;&s;ive rigours of epi&s;co|pal dominion, their pious ance&s;tors came over to the&s;e then in|ho&s;pitable &s;hores. No wonder then their de&s;cendants, equally tenacious of the rights of con&s;cience, &s;hould &s;tart at the threat|ened un&s;heathing of an Anti-Chri&s;tian &s;word among them, which forced their fathers to fly from all their temporal po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and the land of their nativity. No wonder aver&s;e to an order of men, who&s;e a&s;piring genius and &s;ervent zeal for eccle|&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, they have rea&s;on to apprehend would continu|ally prompt them, to draw or force men from the religion of their forefathers; of the &s;criptural purity of which they have too high a conviction, ever to abandon; nay, would ri&s;que their all in defence of, rather than &s;acrifice at the empty &s;hrine of epi&s;copacy. The candour, lenity, &s;pirit of toleration, and charity, which it is now &s;aid, is &s;o con&s;picuous in the church of England, is mo&s;t &s;oothingly urged as an argument to conciliate the acquie&s;cence of di&s;&s;enters, of all denominations, in the fa|vourite plan of an American epi&s;copate. <Q>With &s;o much mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s and moderation (&s;ays Dr. Chandler) have the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, for a long cour&s;e of years exerci&s;ed their authority, as &s;carcely to have afforded an in&s;tance of rea&s;onable complaint, e&s;pecially to di&s;&s;enters.</Q> But pray let me a&s;k the Dr.&mdash;Did this boa&s;ted mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s and mode|ration, &s;hine out with &s;o clear a lu&s;tre, when very lately at their council-board, their lord&s;hips of Canterbury and London pur|po&s;ely appeared, to oppo&s;e &s;o incon&s;iderable a reque&s;t, as that of a charter of incorporation to the pre&s;byterian church in New-York, even after the lords of trade, to who&s;e con&s;ideration the petition was referred, had reported, that they &s;aw no rea&s;on to refute the prayer of the petitioners. And that &s;o trifling a fa|vour, hath been frequently refu&s;ed to both Engli&s;h and Dutch pre&s;byterians in this province, is a matter of general notoriety. The&s;e are illu&s;trious in&s;tances, &s;urely, of the friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the church of England, and her benevolent prelates, towards their prote&s;tant fellow Chri&s;tians in America!&mdash;We glory in being &s;ubject to a prince, the maxims of who&s;e government in the&s;e regions, &s;acred to freedom, have always been equally fa|vourable to Prote&s;tants, of every Chri&s;tian denomination, and re&s;trictive of eccle&s;ia&s;tical domination, from every quarter. And I am &s;o far from thinking with Dr. C&mdash;, that there are "peculiar rea&s;ons of policy" to induce his maje&s;ty, to adopt his favourite plan of an American epi&s;copate, that I am clearly
<PB N="400" REF="010857_0201_0F851D8A73552CA0">of opinion, there are peculiar rea&s;ons of policy, which totally and ab&s;olutely oppo&s;e it. And this I doubt not &s;till more a|bundantly to evince, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers.</P>

<P>FOR our next entertainment, Squire <HI>T.</HI> very genteelly &s;ets before us the relicks of &s;everal former meals, not <HI>furni&s;h'd</HI> but <HI>ha&s;h'd up</HI> by one of his <HI>under-cooks,</HI> the marrow and gravy, any the very guts, of which, is the old tale about Je&s;uits; they &s;eem to give him great &s;atisfaction; but we beg to be excu&s;ed &s;wallowing, tho' &s;tale as they are, we &s;hall venture to ta&s;te &s;ome of the di&s;hes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cour&s;e is dre&s;t in a particular manner by the <HI>&s;cullion,</HI> acknowledg'd to be his own invention, in which we have <HI>&s;er|pents, &s;pawn, foam, venom, &s;tings, Egyptian onions, wine of fornication, &amp;c.</HI> The two la&s;t ingredients indeed he &s;peaks of as exotics; however his ma&s;ter has probably more than enough of the la&s;t, &s;tor'd in his cellar; and of the fir&s;t, growing rampant in his garden.

P</HI>'s letter &s;eems to be contain'd in that notable pa&s;&s;age, in which he calls us of the faction, <Q>the real &s;pawn of that invenom'd brood who bur&s;t the bonds of gratitude, ju&s;tice and, religion and in a torrent (<HI>a torrent of brood!</HI>) overturn'd altars, levell'd churches, and laid wa&s;te principalities and and powers.</Q> This really &s;eems to be &s;omewhat too high a charge; but however truth requires that we &s;hou'd do ju&s;tice to the character of the church, by frankly, freely and &s;incerely, confe&s;&s;ing, that we, as well as our fathers have at lea&s;t wre&s;tled with "principalities and powers," <HI>with the rulers of the dark|ne&s;s of this world,</HI>&mdash;and even with the <HI>&s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places.</HI></P>

But the flower of all the beautiful non&s;en&s;e, the reader may &s;ee, in the clo&s;e of the 2d paragraph, in which we are given to under&s;tand, that the <HI>church of England</HI> has an <HI>enemy;</HI>&mdash;that enemy is <HI>St. Pe|ter's &s;word;</HI>&mdash;that &s;word is capable of the pa&s;&s;ion <HI>hope;</HI>&mdash; the object of that hope is <HI>univer&s;al monarchy.</HI>&mdash;that monar|chy cannot be obtain'd without <HI>undermining</HI> not <HI>one only,</HI> but <HI>each of the foundations,</HI> of no le&s;s then <HI>all</HI> the <HI>con&s;titutionS</HI> of the church;&mdash;this undermining is a <HI>glorious de&s;ign;</HI>&mdash;and, in order to accompli&s;h it, the <HI>&s;word in&s;pires it&s;elf,</HI> and all its <HI>engines,</HI> with&mdash;(with what?&mdash;courage? no!) with <HI>application and diligence.</HI> Now who but the mo&s;t con&s;ummate block-head wou'd ever have thought, that the church's grand enemy was a <HI>&s;word; that a &s;word</HI> cou'd hope any more than a <HI>bayonet,</HI> or be a <HI>king,</HI> any more than a pike-&s;taff;&mdash;that a <HI>&s;word</HI> wou'd think it <HI>glorious</HI> (for what can hope can think) dig under &s;tone walls like a <HI>mattock;</HI> or that it &s;hou'd be able to in&s;pire it&s;elf, or even its engines (whatever they may be) with <HI>application,</HI> any more than that Squire <HI>T.</HI> &s;hould in&s;pire <HI>T.

<P>UNHAPPY it is for man, that &s;ome of his &s;pecies enter|tain a &s;avage de&s;ire of gorging their animo&s;ity by giving pain to others. Re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;compos'd in them&s;elves, they love to &s;ee all things ruffled and di&s;order'd around them. Like &s;ome lion of the wood, they proudly &s;urvey the havock and carnage they have occa&s;ion'd, and fea&s;t their mi&s;anthropy on the wounds of public tranquility. They delight in di&s;play|ing the dark &s;ide of &s;ubjects; in clouding beauties, and pointing out deformities. Such (I am &s;orry to &s;ay) appear the men on who&s;e mea&s;ures I have undertaken to animadvert. A &s;incere love to <HI>religion</HI> and my <HI>country,</HI> has only engaged me in this ta&s;k. The Chri&s;tain, that truly e&s;teems the <HI>former,</HI> cannot but endeavour to promote every undertaking that may advance its intere&s;t, and oppo&s;e every procedure that has a manife&s;t ten|dency to di&s;&s;erve it; and the hone&s;t man, who &s;incerely loves the <HI>latter,</HI> will find it his duty to detect and re&s;i&s;t every iniqui|tous attempt, to di&s;turb the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and endanger the welfare of his country, by &s;owing the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y, or kindling the fires of party &s;pirit.</P>

It has ever been the practice of tho&s;e, who were endeavour|ing to &s;ubvert any con&s;titution, whether of church or &s;tate, (with de&s;ign to rai&s;e another more agreeable to their inclina|tions) a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to harangue the populace on its defects, to enumerate and magnify every &s;tain, but to overlook every beau|ty or advantage; and to exaggerate and cen&s;ure tho&s;e deficien|cies which nece&s;&s;arily attend every government, as if only to be found in, and peculiar to the <HI>one</HI> they di&s;like&mdash;This &s;cheme (however unju&s;t) is craftily political, and too &s;eldom fails of &s;ucce&s;s. For as the generality of men have neither lei&s;ure nor abilities to enter into an exact examination, they depend on the opinions of tho&s;e who they imagine have the opportunities and wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary. The love of liberty, the enmity to corruption, and a&s;&s;iduous regard the&s;e politicians profe&s;s, conciliate their e&s;teem. The frightful picture of magnified blemi&s;hes they hold up, together with a de&s;ire of novelty, mo&s;t natural to igno|rance, inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace, and &s;o root their prejudice, that they become, in a great mea&s;ure, invincible. They are led by degrees to be at la&s;t guilty of crimes, they would at fir&s;t have thought of with horror. This was the ea&s;e &s;oon after the reformation in <HI>Germany;</HI> as in avoiding one extreme, men mo&s;t commonly are precipitated into the oppo&s;ite (and &s;ome|times more dangerous) one. A &s;ect was rai&s;ed under pretence at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> of only reforming &s;ome of tho&s;e things, which they imagined not yet &s;ufficiently <HI>pure.</HI> The founders began to preach up a greater perfection in morals; from hence they pro|ceeded to reprove all who were any way ob&s;ervers of civility and decency; to pronounce it &s;inful to po&s;&s;e&s;s the conveniencies of life: And determining that all other books were pernicious, they met, and burnt all they could <HI>obtain,</HI> but the Bible. When they had got to this eminence, their ma&s;k began to tremble and fall off. They term'd all mini&s;ters but their own, "wicked idolaters of antichri&s;t's &s;ynagogue." They &s;aid that all kingdoms &s;hould be de&s;troy'd to make room for the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and labour'd in aboli&s;hing the execution of ju&s;tice, becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, <HI>"re&s;i&s;t not evil,"</HI> and in bringing on a community of goods, becau&s;e Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles were an example. Their teachers &s;tood up as advocates for "ab&s;olute liberty, free and impartial liberty," preaching again&s;t magi&s;|trates, and that all men &s;hould be on a level. Such doctrine of <HI>re-reformation</HI> were &s;ure to be eagerly &s;wallowed by a licen+tious rabble. Accordingly when their numbers had great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> increa&s;ed, they pretended the earth was given them by the Lord, and form'd them&s;elves into a&s;&s;ociations to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion They laid a&s;ide all di&s;gui&s;e; And the&s;e preachers of mortifica|tion,
<PB N="406" REF="010857_0204_0F851D8D1DC70048">thought it lawful to take &s;ix or &s;even wives apiece. <HI>They,</HI> who at fir&s;t affirm'd ju&s;tice and judgment to be mercile&s;s cruelty, now accounted their hands &s;anctify'd by being inbrued in Chri&s;tian blood. They who at their emer&s;ion, forbad their followers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the conveniencies of life, and &s;uing for their right, thought at la&s;t it was agreeable to God to turn their adver&s;aries out of their hou&s;es, and to enrich them&s;elves with the pillage of their goods&mdash;which being laid to their charge, their an&s;wer was, "the time is come, according to our Saviour's promi&s;e, <HI>that the meek &s;hall inherit the earth."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide&mdash;Guy de Bre&s;s cont.

<P>Parallel to this was the behaviour of tho&s;e men, who in the reign of Charles I. &s;et out with a pretence of obtaining liberty of con&s;cience, and afterwards, as they increa&s;ed in power, in|crea&s;ed in the in&s;olence of their demands; and not content with a free toleration, would force all denominations to fall down and wor&s;hip the brazen Idol of <HI>Pre&s;bytery,</HI> which <HI>they</HI> had &s;et up.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO believe that among the Chri&s;tian clergy, there is an order called bi&s;hops <HI>jure divino</HI> &s;uperior to the re&s;t, is to be an epi&s;copalian. But to wi&s;h to &s;ee the&s;e bi&s;hops clothed with worldly honours, wealth, and power, and turned into lords, is papi&s;tical, repugnant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, and utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of &s;ound policy. Every prote&s;tant churchman will therefore, while he approves the humole apo&s;tolic &s;hepherd, dete&s;t the proud prelatic Pontiff, as a dangerous character, that &s;prang up in the churches, un|der the dominion of anti-chri&s;t. Such being the va&s;t difference between a Bi&s;hop and a Prelate, what wonder that a country, not yet duped by the clergy, &s;hould eye the project of introdu|cing an epi&s;copate, with all that jealou&s;y which an attachment to liberty nece&s;&s;arily in&s;pires; e&s;pecially when, in &s;pite of all the addre&s;s of the partizans of the &s;cheme to conceal their true aim, they have given &s;o many proofs, that Prelates, and not Bi&s;hops, are the characters they wi&s;h to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed among us.</P>
<P>Whether this is &s;ufficiently proved, mu&s;t be left to the public to determine. If the introduction of prelacy, to &s;ubjugate the colonies to the tyranny of prie&s;ts, is the object of Dr. Chand|ler and the convention, it becomes every true &s;on of the church &mdash;every friend to Chri&s;tianity, and lover of this country, to
<PB N="410" REF="010857_0206_0F851D8E41DB20D0">ri&s;e up and &s;et his face like a flint again&s;t a &s;cheme of &s;o perni|cious a tendency. The temporal powers of the Bi&s;hops in England, were popi&s;h inve&s;titures, and there are not wanting in&s;tances of pious Bi&s;hops, in every age &s;ince the reformation, who have lamented the&s;e annexations as expo&s;ing them to inter|ruptions and cares, foreign to the original de&s;ign of their &s;piri|tual offices, unfriendly to religion, and impediments to the re|&s;toration of primitive purity.</P>
<P>Having the honour to agree with the&s;e worthies of our church, and conceiving that if the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an epi&s;copate in America, was left to the &s;ole management of the clergy here, and the bench of Bi&s;hops in England, it would participate large|ly of a prelatical mixture; and that it was indeed impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e, without an alteration of the law, I thought it my duty, tho' a churchman, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in awakening the public to a &s;alutary vigilance, to convict the mi&s;&s;ionaries of their inde|cent neglect of the government, the laity, and the Bi&s;hop of London their &s;uperior, and to vindicate our church in general from the odium of a mea&s;ure, contrived by a few meddling prie&s;ts, to advance their own intere&s;t, and naturally productive (unle&s;s certain preliminary &s;ecurities are given) of the mo&s;t tra|gical con&s;equences, to the&s;e weak and expo&s;ed di&s;per&s;ions of the empire.&mdash;With the&s;e views, I &s;hall continue my corre&s;pond|ence with you, and tru&s;t my letters to your candour, provided my &s;entiments are not changed.&mdash;Concerning the &s;tyle I am not &s;olicitous; and it is therefore &s;ubmitted to your correction.</P>
<P>That the majority of the epi&s;copalians are not chargeable with this pe&s;tilent enterpri&s;e, &s;hall be the &s;cope of this letter, in order to remove any &s;u&s;picions to the contrary, which the guilty contrivers of the plot are fal&s;ely and wickedly endeavouring to propagate. This may be argued from the character and princi|ples of the American churchmen; the conduct of the petition|ers for an epi&s;copate, and the nature and method of their de|fence, again&s;t the attacks they have received.</P>
<P>As to our character, it is notorious to all the world; and nothing but malice it&s;elf, can prompt any man to deny, that in principle we are as di&s;tant from the tories, as any Whigs or low churchmen in England. Few, very few Americans, avow the ab&s;urd and &s;lavi&s;h doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non re|&s;i&s;tance; nor can any per&s;ua&s;ion claim the honour of a more zealous attachment to revolution principles, or a &s;incerer, more fervent and &s;teady affection to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the pre&s;ent reigning family. As a&s;&s;erters of liberty, who excelled us in the late memorable oppo&s;ition to the &s;tamp-act? Nay, per|mit me to mention it with triumph, that the Virginians are al|mo&s;t

<P>The Americans are plain in their manners, virtuou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed; neither puffed up by a love of pomp and luxury on the one hand, nor di&s;pirited by poverty on the other.&mdash;Long ac|cu&s;tomed to freedom, jealous of their rights, and watchful of the undue extent of the prerogative. Hence it is, that in all their public expences in government, they are the mo&s;t frugal oeconomi&s;ts in the world. This is the known character of all the provinces. Epi&s;copal and non-epi&s;copal.&mdash;And if none will dare to a&s;&s;ert, and I am &s;ure none can with truth and ju&s;tice a&s;&s;ert the contrary, how improbable that a people &s;o principled, &s;hould be &s;olicitous for domineering ma&s;ters of any kind, or in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to countenance a mea&s;ure which, con&s;idering the infant and feeble &s;tate of the colonies, will inevi|tably expo&s;e them to the dominion of the clergy. To this very day the epi&s;copalians of Virginia, where there are no di&s;&s;enters to check their power, are &s;o far from a blind devotion to the cler|gy, that the public provi&s;ion for them extends only to two churches in a county, with an allowance to each incumbent, of a little more than &pound; 200, per annum. A &s;um &s;carce &s;ufficient for their decent &s;upport.</P>
<P>And that this is the general &s;pirit of the continent, the whole prie&s;thood, &s;uperior and inferior, on both &s;ides of the water, mu&s;t long have been &s;en&s;ible.&mdash;The chief end of erecting the &s;ociety for the propagating the go&s;pel, according to the te&s;ti|mony of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of epi&s;|copal authority in this country; and yet we have &s;een more than half a century roll away, without accompli&s;hing a de&s;ign ea&s;ily effected, could the Americans have been prevailed upon to open their pur&s;e &s;trings.&mdash;ever &s;u&s;picious, that under the cloak of epi&s;copacy, prelacy might &s;teal in, and e&s;teeming &s;pi|ritual courts a hard&s;hip, infinitely greater than a Bi&s;hop's ab|&s;ence, we have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted the &s;olicitations of the lower clergy, and the influence of the right reverend bench, from the reign of king William to the pre&s;ent day; and &s;ince the &s;outhern colonies might, if they plea&s;ed, have ea&s;ily given their lord&s;hips a &s;afe port to land in, and the political objections, now &s;tarted

<P>The conduct of the con&s;pirators of this plot, is a further proof, that they are a contemptible miniority.&mdash;Had the project been devi&s;ed or avowed by our communion in general, a due re&s;pect would have been &s;hewn to government, and to the Bi&s;hop of London, in the means of giving it &s;ucce&s;s. Such marks of wi&s;dom, prudence, and temper, would have appeared in every &s;tep taken, as became a denomination &s;o numerous, loyal, and wi&s;e. How obvious was the plan, which even com|mon &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to dictate.&mdash;In the &s;outhern pro|vinces, where the epi&s;copalians have the power in their own hands, what more is requi&s;ite than a joint petition of governor, council, and a&s;&s;embly, to the throne, for his maje&s;ty's appro|bation of a law, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an epi&s;copate, in the colony reque&s;ting it. And if nothing more was aimed at than primitive epi&s;copacy, what colony &s;o poor as not to be able to &s;upport a hundred Bi&s;hops of apo&s;tolical grandeur&mdash;This, when effected in any province, would, in all, remove the objec|tion ari&s;ing from the danger, and expence of a voyage to Eu|rope for ordination; and in the colonies, where the legi&s;lative power is divided among prote&s;tants, of different denominations, if the mi&s;conduct of the clergy, and the want of confirmation, rendered our people unea&s;y, we might urge the legi&s;lature to favour the extent of the other epi&s;copates, or the introduction of Bi&s;hops of our own, and if that failed, the acce&s;s to the crown, for its influence was open; and thus the &s;cheme would have ad|vanced, in proportion to the benefits experienced, and the &s;ecurity we could gradually obtain again&s;t the pride of prela|cy, &s;o de&s;ervedly dreaded by the whole continent, and &s;o natu|rally to be apprehended from a precipitate introduction of epi&s;|copacy, archieved by clergymen alone.</P>
<P>In this way, no umbrage would be given to the government, nor could the Bi&s;hop of London have complained of a contempt of the authority he claims, under the countenance of the royal in&s;tructions, long u&s;age, and our own voluntary concurrence.&mdash;Mea&s;ures of this kind could have given no ju&s;t offence, and mea&s;ures le&s;s prudent and temperate, the whole church would never have approved&mdash;But fully &s;en&s;ible, that our denomi|nation was generally di&s;affected to the lea&s;t mixture of prelacy, and therefore would either not concur in the project of an epi&s;|copate, at a juncture &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable as the pre&s;ent; or proceed

It is not long &s;ince we were told in a pamphlet a&s;cribed to one of the greate&s;t dignitaries of the church of England, that Bi&s;hops would be &s;ent to America, as &s;oon as the people were di&s;po&s;ed to receive them. His Grace is, perhaps, by this time convinced, that he pre&s;umed too far upon his own influence in the cabinet; but it is not improbable that this hint inflamed the zealots, who tran&s;mitted the &s;even petitions, which have given &s;o much of|fence,&mdash;Fortunately to us, &s;o &s;lender a &s;ub&s;cription was le&s;s evidence of the popularity of the cau&s;e, than the author of the pamphlet expected, and hence they were laid under an inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, of divulging the &s;ecret to the laity. That all ranks might be drawn into an approbation, of what the clergy had contrived, Mr. Chandler was dubbed Doctor, and employed like a wild Iri&s;h mourner, to utter &s;ighs, groans, and lamenta|tions for hard&s;hips&mdash;hard&s;hips unparallel'd, hard&s;hips, which, till this memorable appeal appeared in print, were never thought of, unle&s;s by a few high-flying nece&s;&s;itous zealots of the gown.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a &s;hort but true hi&s;tory of the late attempt to introduce prelacy,&mdash;The clergy, and but a few of the&s;e, are the authors; and 'tis to facilitate that de&s;ign, that we lately hear of their frequent a&s;&s;emblies under the name of the conven|tion.&mdash;A practice unknown to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of England, and to which his lord&s;hip, the Bi&s;hop of London, will doubtle&s;s very &s;oon, in ju&s;tice to his character, apply a &s;uit|able remedy.</P>
<P>Our general di&s;countenance of the petitioners is the la&s;t proof I &s;hall advance, of our abhorrence of their &s;cheme. Prelacy, odious as it is, has had apologi&s;ts of abilities, and their de&s;ences have been artful and &s;pecious; but was ever a &s;ett of projectors at a more ridiculous plunge, than the pre&s;ent pretended de&s;end|ers of our church!&mdash;Judging from their weekly produc|tions, 'tis cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that not a man of learning or genius among&s;t us will come out to their aid.&mdash;Such we have, and they are as willing to vindicate the rights of the church, as they lately proved them&s;elves able to maintain the civil liberties of this con|tinent.
<PB N="414" REF="010857_0208_0F851D918CE8A060">But appri&s;ed that an epi&s;copate will introduce the ty|ranny of prie&s;ts, and the inqui&s;itorial oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;piritual courts, not a man of &s;en&s;e will take up his pen in &s;o pernicious and di&s;reputable a cau&s;e.&mdash;Hence the di&s;tre&s;s and extremity of the convention, and the pitiful &s;cribblers they have retained in their &s;ervice.&mdash;Wit and &s;ophi&s;try might have concealed the nakedne&s;s of the cau&s;e from the vulgar, and a talent for ri|dicule could have &s;tung an opponent, and diverted the public.&mdash;But the projectors are un&s;upported, abandoned, and unpi|tied.&mdash;The inference is natural, that not a man of abilities in all our churches is on their &s;ide, and for that rea&s;on the pre&s;s groans under a weekly medley of repetition, wrath, buffoonery, non&s;en&s;e, and fal&s;hood.&mdash;In truth, Mr. Whig, all America (a few Tories excepted) is aver&s;e to clerical domination, and almo&s;t every epi&s;copalian in this country, can &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf as I do, a friend to humble primitive Bi&s;hops, but a dete&s;ter of modern, proud prelates, and therefore.</P>

In a more &s;trict (but yet more comprehen&s;ive) &s;en&s;e, it means all <HI>real</HI> Chri&s;tians or members of the univer&s;al invi&s;ible church, <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> v. 25, <HI>Colo&s;.</HI> i. 18. &amp;c. but the word <HI>Ekkle&s;ia</HI> tran&s;lated <HI>church,</HI> is &s;ometimes us'd with more latitude to expre&s;s a congregation of <HI>Jews, Acts</HI> vii. 38. and even to denominate a <HI>promi&s;cuous rab|ble (Acts</HI> xix. 32.) in the <HI>Theatre</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> which, for 2 long hours, cried, <HI>Great is Diana of the Epe&s;ians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Q. <HI>Doth the word</HI> church <HI>al&s;o &s;ignify the</HI> hou&s;e <HI>in which people</HI> meet <HI>for divine wor&s;hip?</HI> A. Yes; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 35, and el&s;ewhere.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Q. <HI>What do you think of the word</HI> meeting? A. It is expre&s;|&s;ive of all that the word church is, (if the purpo&s;e of public wor&s;hip be implied) and &s;eem equivalent to the <HI>Greek</HI> word <HI>Sunagogee,</HI> us'd <HI>James</HI> ii. 2.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Q. <HI>Doth</HI> this <HI>word al&s;o &s;igni|fy the</HI> hou&s;e <HI>in which people a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid?</HI> A. Yes it oftentimes does; tho' it is common expre&s;sly to &s;ay <HI>meet|ing-hou&s;e;</HI> nor wou'd <HI>Church-hou&s;e</HI> be an improper expre&s;&s;ion, were it but authoriz'd by cu&s;tom.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Q. <HI>Are then the words</HI> church <HI>and</HI> meeting <HI>&s;ynonimous?</HI> A They are indeed, whether apply'd to the <HI>people</HI> form'd into congregations, or to the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> in which they a&s;&s;emble.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Q. <HI>But how can the word</HI> church <HI>or</HI> meeting <HI>be applied to</HI> hou&s;es? A. Hou&s;es &s;et apart for public wor&s;hip are figuratively call'd after the a&s;&s;embly of wor&s;hippers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7.

They virtually exclude all denominations of Chri&s;tians but them&s;elves out of the church univer&s;al, out of which according to &s;cripture there is no &s;alvation; and thus pattern after papi&s;ts, who affirm that the <HI>church of</HI> Rome alone is the <HI>Catholic</HI> or uni|ver&s;al church. But to put a more charitable con&s;truction on their way of expre&s;&s;ion, 'tis probable, <HI>they know not what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm,</HI> for they will hardly condemn what they call a &s;incere hone&s;t Pre&s;byterian.</ITEM>

<P>RELIGION is confe&s;&s;edly &s;o advantageous to &s;ociety, that every rea&s;onable man, mu&s;t endeavour to advance it, even thro' a political view of increa&s;ing the happine&s;s of that community of which he is a member. The evidence of this truth &s;eems almo&s;t always to have been &s;o con&s;picuous, that &s;ince the fir&s;t origin of government, every prudent legi&s;la|ture has taken care to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome religion, and afforded a competent maintenance to the mini&s;ters of it. The ultimate advantages of hone&s;ly, and obedience to government, were not &s;ufficiently evident and glaring, to re&s;train the Fallies of ambi|tion, or the unre&s;i&s;ted de&s;ire of unlimitted freedom; the future rewards therefore of virtue, and puni&s;hments of vice, were nece&s;|&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h that <HI>order</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> &s;o requi&s;ite to the ju&s;t mo|tion in the &s;prings of every political &s;y&s;tem. But the duty of &s;up|porting religion receives &s;tronger enforcements, when we con&s;i|der that the one we are now to promote, is the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> reli|gion; &mdash;a &s;y&s;tem which has not only the mo&s;t undoubted evi|dences of truth, but is fram'd by its precepts and &s;pirit, more e&s;pecially to favour the well-being of &s;ociety,&mdash;convinced of this, the government al&s;o to which we are &s;ubjects, from a number of denominations profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, but differing for the mo&s;t part meerly in external modes, has cho&s;en <HI>one</HI> which &s;he thought mo&s;t concording in its polity with the &s;tate; mo&s;t agreeable to the major part of the nation; and mo&s;t fitted in its principles and regimen, to promote the happine&s;s and unity of the kingdom.&mdash;As Chri&s;tians therefore, it is our duty to advance the general intere&s;t of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;And as mem|bers of &s;ociety, particularly to favour that form of church go|vernment, which tho' it was at fir&s;t indifferent, yet cea&s;es to be &s;o by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the civil magi&s;trate. An e&s;tabli&s;h|ment which has co&s;t a million of lives; for which our fore-fa|thers willingly &s;uffered the &s;evere&s;t deaths! An e&s;tabli&s;hment,
<PB N="418" REF="010857_0210_0F851D932028B250">which the wi&s;e&s;t politicians, whether native or foreign, account an honour to Britons; the nice&s;t adapted to monarchical go|vernment, and be&s;t con&s;tituted to pre&s;erve liberty, learning and true religion; and to diffu&s;e principles of benevolence, patrio|ti&s;m, and concord.&mdash;Whoever therefore endeavours to li|bel it, or prejudice its mini&s;ters, is either an enemy to his coun|try, or endeavours to &s;hew his love in a very dangerous and ill|conceiv'd manner. As it is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of this re|ligion, and the <HI>divine author</HI> of it him&s;elf has appointed, that certain officers &s;hould be &s;et apart to inculcate its doctrines, ad|mini&s;ter its Sacraments, and watch that <HI>all things</HI> may <HI>be done to edification;</HI> &s;o it is equally nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their due performance of the&s;e offices, that the people entertain and e&s;teem for their function, a reverence and regard to their charac|ters, and a favourable opinion of their virtue. Where-ever therefore &s;entiments contrary to the&s;e are promoted, religion mu&s;t certainly &s;uffer, and our country con&s;equently &s;uffer with it. There is naturally in mo&s;t men a baneful pronene&s;s to re|joice in the di&s;covery of blemi&s;hes and imperfections in tho&s;e, who by their &s;uperiority in &s;tation, are &s;uppos'd to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uperior virtue. It is the fault of weak minds, that they en|deavour not to rai&s;e them&s;elves, but to deba&s;e others to an equa|lity with them. <HI>Vice</HI> delights to &s;uppre&s;s a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own deformity, by partial compari&s;ons of it with aggavated repre&s;entations of the deformity of others: Hence may proceed that <HI>avarice</HI> of magnifying the defects of clergymen; that eagle-eyed ob&s;ervation of their infirmities; and that un&s;atiated avidity with which the mo&s;t nau&s;eous tales of calumny (con|cerning them) are &s;wallow'd down.</P>
<P>An e&s;teem and reverence for another, is requi&s;ite to engage us to li&s;ten candidly to, and earne&s;tly practi&s;e his advice: The enemies of Chri&s;tianity and &s;ociety, con&s;cious of this, have ever made it their &s;tudy to affix the vile&s;t &s;tains on its mini&s;ters, and to deba&s;e the <HI>order</HI> as low as po&s;&s;ible; knowing that, according to its &s;ucce&s;s or decay, religion would be weakened or pro&s;per. &mdash;In this they have been but too &s;ucce&s;sful! The Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood, in&s;tead of being held in the mo&s;t honourable light, &s;erves as a theme for the puerile &s;atire of every dough-&s;cull'd top, prating buffoon, or illiterate debauchee; who expiatate o'er their Cups on the luxury, avarice, folly, and intemperance of the <HI>clergy.</HI></P>
<P>But not content with this victory, the&s;e "foes to eccle&s;ia&s;tical influence," have march'd farther into their enemies territories, and (con&s;idering the church-e&s;tabli&s;hment as the &s;tronge&s;t bul|wark, again&s;t their &s;ucce&s;s) have ince&s;&s;antly aim'd their fire at

<P>In order to rai&s;e the re&s;entment of other denominations, it has al&s;o been a&s;&s;erted, that the church of England deems all the foreign Prote&s;tant churches, no churches.

And it is highly rea&s;onable that none &s;hould enjoy the immunities, &s;et apart by a &s;ociety for a particular u&s;e, without complying with the terms required. A free and exten|&s;ive toleration is allowed them, and even churches have been rais'd for them at the public co&s;t. The chief dignitaries al&s;o of the church have ever held them in the highe&s;t e&s;timation,&mdash; thought, as their fir&s;t &s;ounders did, their ordination <HI>excu&s;able</HI> thro' the nece&s;&s;ity and urgency of the ca&s;e,&mdash;never &s;crupled,

Even <HI>Laud,</HI> (who&s;e unhappy name has been &s;o much and &s;o injuriou&s;ly &s;tigmatiz'd) held a friendly corre&s;pon|dence with the prote&s;tant churches: See his letter in 1639, to the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> divines, in the <HI>Prae&s;tantium viorum</HI> Epi&s;tolae, Ep. 552. where they are called by him <HI>Confrates mei Chari&s;&s;imi;</HI> and of their letter to him he &s;aith, <Q>It was agreeable to me on a double account, as it was their's, and exhorting to Chri&s;ti|an peace.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A brief view of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, as it is at this Day practi&s;ed in <HI>England:</HI> Addre&s;&s;ed to Sir <HI>Nathaniel Curzon,</HI> Bart. and the re&s;t of the Gentlemen of the Committee ap|pointed by Parliament, for enquiring into the Abu&s;es and Corruptions of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts and Juri&s;dictions. (Fir&s;t printed in the year 1733.)</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the grand inque&s;t of the kingdom of Great-Britain, have devolved upon you the tru&s;t of enquiring into the abu&s;es and corruptions of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts and juri&s;|dictions, give me leave briefly, and in miniature, to repre&s;ent to your view, a contracted &s;cheme of tho&s;e courts and juri&s;dic|tions in England; whereby it will appear what an incredible &s;um is yearly drained and &s;queezed out of the people's pur&s;es and e&s;tates by &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers and &s;piritual per&s;ons, who make gain their only godline&s;s.</P>
<P>But as my intent here is not to intermeddle with their doc|trines of faith, or practices in religion, I &s;hall only at pre&s;ent enquire, whether a great cau&s;e of the impoveri&s;hing of this
<PB N="423" REF="010857_0212_0F851D9423AC89B0">nation, is not occa&s;ioned by an over-numerous body of eccle&s;i|a&s;ticks among us, and by the exactions, extortions, and oppre&s;|&s;ions, of what are called &s;piritual courts and juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P>In order to this enquiry, I beg leave to recite a maxim or ob&s;ervation of the lord Verulam, (which will be found to con|tain an eternal truth) viz. <HI>That a &s;maller number who &s;pend more and earn le&s;s, do &s;ooner wear out an e&s;tate, than a greater number that live lower</HI> (meaner) <HI>and gather more; &s;o it is</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>with an overgrown</HI> (i. e. a numerous and luxuriant) <HI>clergy.</HI> For they con&s;ume the labours of <HI>others, but bringing in nothing to the &s;tock.</HI></P>
<P>And that the &s;tock and produce of the Engli&s;h nation, is in a great mea&s;ure &s;wallowed up and devoured by the numerous body of our eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and their juri&s;dictions, courts, and officers, will I believe evidently appear, if you con&s;ider the fol|lowing ob&s;ervables, re&s;pecting tho&s;e per&s;ons, and their courts and juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P N="1">I. We have here in England two provincial Archbi&s;hops, Canterbury, and York; each of which has his princely retinue for the &s;upport of his temporal grandeur, as well as a numerous body of &s;piritual officers, for the exerci&s;e and execution of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction and authority.</P>
<P>In the number of their temporal retinue, we may reckon their &s;tewards and baliffs of lord&s;hips, manors, lands &amp;c. &s;tewards of their hou&s;holds, gentlemen-u&s;hers, u&s;hers of their halls, comp|trollers, yeomen of their hor&s;e, &s;ecretaries, hou&s;e keepers, purveyors, butlers, cooks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And among the latter, their &s;uffragans, vicars-general, guar|dians of &s;piritualities, chancellors, officials, commi&s;&s;aries, deans, arch-deacons, regi&s;ters, deputy-regi&s;ters, advocates, apparitors, projectors, <HI>cum multis aliis.</HI></P>
<P>And as the officers and attendants of the&s;e arch-bi&s;hops are of two kinds, &s;o are their courts. viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Courts temporal, as courts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eet, courts baron, cu&s;tomary courts, courts of franchi&s;es and privileges, courts of piepowder, (for &s;ome of them keep fairs and markets) and other like courts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Courts &s;piritual, as the courts of arches (to Canterbury) prerogative courts, courts of delegates, con&s;i&s;tory courts, or courts of audience, courts of faculties for granting licences and di&s;pen&s;ations (with divers others.)</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">II. Next, as to bi&s;hops (who in mo&s;t things imitate arch|bi&s;hops) we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That within England we have twenty-four dioce&s;an bi&s;hops.</ITEM>

<P>But as I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enter into a di&s;qui&s;ition of their e&s;tates in lord&s;hips, manors, lands, palaces, gardens, &amp;c. &s;o I &s;hall here wave all enquiry into the &s;tate of their temporal re|venues; my pre&s;ent intention being chiefly to remark on their eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;piritual courts and juri&s;dictions.&mdash;Wherein I ob&s;erve, that our twenty four bi&s;hops have, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the exerci&s;e and execution of their &s;piritual juri&s;diction, the following officers, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>24 Suffragans, if not double the number, with their atten|dants.</ITEM>

<P>With many other officers, notaries, clerks, and attendants.</P>
<P>Note, <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> as well as <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> have their di&s;tinct courts, <HI>i. e.</HI> one in each divi&s;ion of tho&s;e dioce&s;es.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o under the&s;e archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops at lea&s;t,
<LIST>
<ITEM>60 Arch-deaconries. And to the&s;e belong,</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 Arch-deacons courts; which con&s;i&s;t of</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 Commi&s;&s;aries or judges of tho&s;e courts; as al&s;o</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 or more &s;urrogates, or deputy commi&s;&s;aries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 Regi&s;ters, with their deputies, &s;cribes and clerks.</ITEM>
<ITEM>120 Proctors (<HI>i. e.</HI> if we allow but two to each court.)</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>See of the exerci&s;e of their juri&s;diction hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>But further, be&s;ides the before-mentioned officers, we may ob&s;erve another, who, in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical oeconomy, is called a dean, in latin <HI>Decanus.</HI> For that, 'tis &s;aid, in his fir&s;t in&s;ti|tution, he was to pre&s;ide over ten pari&s;hes, which was therefore called a deanery.</P>
<P>But deans are now with us di&s;tingui&s;hed into four or five kinds, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Cathedral deans; the&s;e, with their re&s;pective chapters, have in many things a concurrent juri&s;diction with the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e: And &s;ome authorities they have which are inde|pendent of him. The number of this kind of deans in Eng|land and Wales is twenty-four: For at St. David's and Lan|daff
<PB N="425" REF="010857_0213_0F851D94EA800910">they have no cathedral deans, the office of dean being there exerci&s;ed by the bi&s;hops them&s;elves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Collegiate deans, &s;ome whereof have all the concomitants and attendants of a cathedral dean, except that of having a bi&s;hop at their head; &s;uch a dean is that of We&s;tmin&s;ter col|lege, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Exempt deans, i. e. &s;uch as are exempt from epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, as having an independent eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction within their own particular precincts; &s;uch a dean is that of Battle in Su&s;&s;ex, who is, or may be, inve&s;ted in his deanry by the king's letters patents, and needs no in&s;titution or induction by the bi&s;hop or archdeacon. <HI>Quaere,</HI> of the dean or provo&s;t of Eaton college, if an exempt, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Non-Exempt deans, i. e. &s;uch as are not &s;o exempt as a|fore&s;aid. The&s;e are generally donatives in the arch-bi&s;hops, and con&s;equently have a peculiar juri&s;diction derived from them; &s;uch are the deans of the arches (and St. Martin le Grand) in London; the dean of Bocking in E&s;&s;ex, with &s;ome others under the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury: And I have heard of the like under the archbi&s;hop of York, but can at pre&s;ent give no certain account of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Rural deans; the&s;e originally had no judicial powers, be|ing only &s;ub&s;tituted by the bi&s;hop to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in granting admi|ni&s;trations and probates of wills. But I am informed, that at this day divers of tho&s;e deans have arrogated to them&s;elves a &s;pecies of juri&s;diction. Though 'tis &s;aid, their chief bu&s;ine&s;s is only to fea&s;t the clergy at vi&s;itations, for which they have a licence to rai&s;e contributions within their deanries.&mdash;See <HI>Nel&s;on</HI>'s <HI>rights of the clergy.</HI> 252, 253, &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And &s;eeing we have mentioned cathedral deans, I &s;hall here beg leave to give a &s;pecimen of the &s;everal parts or members whereof the cathedratic choir or body is u&s;ually compo&s;ed; which, taking our pattern from that at St. Paul's, &s;tands thus:</P>
<P>1 Bi&s;hop, 1 dean, 1 &s;ubdean, 1 praecentor, 1 chancellor, who has under him divers &s;cribes, clerks and officers; 1 trea&s;urer, who has an officer called a &s;acri&s;t or &s;acri&s;tan for a coadjutor, and this &s;acri&s;t has 3 or 4 attendants called viergers. There are al&s;o 5 archdeacons, 30 prebendaries, 12 petty canons, 6 or 8 vicars choral, and about 24 chori&s;ters and &s;inging boys, be&s;ides other officers and attendants: The whole number of officers and attendants in this and other cathedrals amounting to about 150, and in &s;ome, as I am informed, to near 200.</P>
<P>And if any per&s;on is de&s;irous to know the &s;everal procurations, &s;ynodals, pen&s;ions, payments and perqui&s;ites appropriated to each of the above-mentioned officers within the dioce&s;e of Lon|don,

And by an account taken from the &s;econd volume of that book, I find that, in the &s;ingle county of E&s;&s;ex, there is yearly paid to the bi&s;hop and archdeacons, in procurations, pen&s;ions, and &s;ynodals only, about 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P>And upon the whole account, which may ea&s;ily be deduced from the foregoing view and &s;pecimen, I think it will evidently appear, that the number of &s;piritual officers and attendants be|longing to archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, archdeacons, and cathedral deans only, will amount to more than 20.000 per&s;ons, be&s;ides preaching mini&s;ters. And that the&s;e receive for their mainte|nance one with another, at lea&s;t forty pounds a man yearly, which will amount to at lea&s;t eight hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum. A &s;urpri&s;ing &s;um! And when we con&s;ider that many of tho&s;e officers, in&s;tead of forty pounds per annum, do make two, three, or four hundred pounds per annum, by their eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments, I conceive the above computation may well be extended to ten hundred thou&s;and pounds per an|num. All which is extorted and &s;quezed out of the people's pur&s;es, merely to &s;upport eccle&s;ia&s;tical power and juri&s;diction.</P>

<P>"I Have never yet heard it <HI>di&s;puted</HI> in" any one that I have been in of <Q>&s;everal companies (to the credit of <HI>their re|&s;pective members</HI> be it &s;poken) whether it be po&s;&s;ible the writer of the letter <HI>Squire T.</HI> has thought fit to publi&s;h in his <HI>Whip,</HI> No. XIV. No. 1. can be an <HI>Independent</HI> in any &s;en&s;e; or whether this piece is in reality any thing el&s;e than a letter from <HI>T. Tickle,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to his own dear &s;elf;"</Q> for <HI>both</HI> "the&s;e que&s;tions were <HI>(nem. con.)</HI> unanimou&s;ly decided in the Negative." Far from having any "objections again&s;t this opinion" I &s;hall lay the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;ign'd before the reader.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The &s;tyle is exactly Squire T's. When we have &s;een a man 14 weeks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, we can't ea&s;ily mi&s;take his <HI>phyz.</HI> e&s;|pecially
<PB N="427" REF="010857_0214_0F851D95A5D2F3F0">if he has &s;ingular &s;eatures; and by this time the pub|lic can be no &s;tranger to Squire <HI>T</HI>'s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The &s;entiments, &s;uch as <HI>reeking from the la&s;h of public indignation,</HI> &amp;c. are very characteri&s;tical of &s;uch a <HI>leather-dre&s;|&s;er</HI> as he.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. No &s;cribbler but Squire <HI>T.</HI> is remember'd to <HI>have</HI> pub|li&s;h'd &s;o many incon&s;i&s;tencies and puerilities, i. e. &s;uch a quan|tity of non&s;en&s;e as is contain'd in the letter under con&s;ideration.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The writer winces like a gall'd hor&s;e at an ob&s;ervation in the 6th <HI>Centinel</HI> (which is perhaps but too ju&s;t) concerning the clergy in general. As this ob&s;ervation (however it may be as to others) is indi&s;putably ju&s;t with regard to mo&s;t of the epi&s;co|pal clergy, and is indeed peculiarly expre&s;&s;ive of the genius of <HI>hierachy;</HI> this writer, if really an <HI>Independent,</HI> mu&s;t, while he in effect calls the <HI>teachers</HI> of his own <HI>particular &s;ect,</HI> Children of Darkne&s;s, have an unaccountable &s;ympathy with the clergy of the Church, and write more out of tenderne&s;s for the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> of <HI>epi&s;copacy,</HI> than zeal for the <HI>right conduct</HI> of <HI>Independency.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The many contemptuous expre&s;&s;ions he u&s;es, e. g. <HI>Pre&s;hy|terian par&s;ons, teachers, &s;ect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her&s;ites, Otway's witch, pro|tectors, Zion,</HI> &amp;c. betray him to be, not the <HI>Independent</HI> he per&s;onates, but a <HI>wolf in &s;heep's</HI> clothing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He unnece&s;&s;arily endeavours to &s;candalize what he pre|tends is his own profe&s;&s;ion <HI>(par. 3d and 5th)</HI> and blacken <HI>Inde|peatents;</HI> and at their expence makes ful&s;ome and unde&s;erv'd complements to the <HI>church,</HI> her <HI>prelates</HI> and <HI>in&s;erior clergy.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. He writes not, like an <HI>Independent,</HI> with the hone&s;t can|dour of ingenuous acknowledgment (and what denomination has not &s;ome faults to acknowledge?) but with all the virulence of <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> party pride and in&s;olence; and yet fancies he looks as while as <HI>alaba&s;ter,</HI> while he (poor &s;oul!) appears to the pub|lic as black as the <HI>jetty Aethiopian.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. In his &s;ly but virulent in&s;inuation, "and why they did "think it probable, becometh not me to &s;ay" <HI>par.</HI> 4. he &s;hews him&s;elf to be a malicious enemy of Di&s;&s;enters; and yet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. In par, 6th is hypocritically &s;hy (becau&s;e of his <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> for&s;ooth) of calling the members of the <HI>church of England,</HI> what I can with great plea&s;ure in &s;pite of <HI>my profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> call &s;ome of them, viz. "A good part of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in <HI>America.</HI>"</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Thro' the whole of his letter this pretended <HI>Independ|ent</HI> &s;ays not a &s;yllable in favour of <HI>Independency,</HI> but acts the part of a champion (and a mi&s;erable one too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poor rogue) for <HI>epi&s;copacy:</HI> In &s;hort, as &s;ervilely as Squire T's pen, he evident|ly expre&s;&s;es whatever the <HI>Whipper</HI> would have.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons I have to a&s;&s;ign, why we are to con&s;ider
<PB N="428" REF="010857_0215_0F851D9713D03078">this letter-writer, not as an <HI>Independent,</HI> but as an <HI>Hanger-on,</HI> and why Squire <HI>T.</HI> is believ'd to be the man; I fancy the pub|lic will judge them deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>Par. 4. This writer boldly challenges our evidence with re|gard to the <HI>conventional petitions</HI> (which he po&s;&s;ibly flatters him&s;elf are &s;till conceal'd in their original darkne&s;s) but let him not be too impatient for its publication, or too &s;anguine as to the judgment of the public. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> may be &s;ooner than he could wi&s;h, and the <HI>la&s;t</HI> unexpected.</P>
<P>The &s;ophi&s;try of <HI>par.</HI> 6th mu&s;t needs be evident to all who have read whatever has been written during the pre&s;ent contro|ver&s;y; however I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the &s;um of the whole is this, <HI>That we are</HI> enemies to liberty <HI>becau&s;e we can't confent that tho&s;e who have always</HI> abus'd <HI>it &s;hou'd be inve&s;ted with a</HI> liberty <HI>of encroaching upon</HI> our Liberty.</P>
<P>As to good old Dr. Chauncey, he evidently has <HI>candour</HI> enough, and (in &s;pite of his years) <HI>intellectual vigour</HI> more than &s;ufficient, to &s;hew to the world (were he <HI>properly</HI> call'd upon) whether or not he has <HI>wretchedly, wickedly</HI> or <HI>weekly</HI> (<HI>one, all</HI> or <HI>neither</HI>) "impos'd upon the public;" &s;o that it were as ab&s;urd in me to &s;tand his &s;econd again&s;t this pretended <HI>Independent,</HI> as to undertake to defend a generous <HI>Hercules,</HI> again&s;t the impotent attacks of an in&s;ignificant <HI>Gnat.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole, this &s;cribbler certainly meant to ape the <HI>Ame|rican church man</HI> in the <HI>Whig;</HI> but for want of abilities, (poor fellow!) he has, in&s;tead of an <HI>Adonis,</HI> "chizzel'd out a <HI>Ther&s;ites,</HI> and, while his pencil a&s;pir'd to the pourtrait of a <HI>Venus,</HI> it has only <HI>daub'd out</HI> the frightful figure of&mdash; a Witch.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am a <HI>Church of England Man,</HI> but, neither violently prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of my own principles, nor &s;piteful to|wards tho&s;e who belong to any other denomination. The greater part of my friends and relations are Pre&s;byterians, or Congregationali&s;ts; principally the latter. An intimate ac|quaintance, and mutual Interchange of kindne&s;s betwixt me and them, has made us hearty friends to each other; nor can a thou&s;and <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Centinels,</HI> per&s;uade them that I am a per&s;e|cutor, a Savage, a Jacobite, a Papi&s;t, an Idiot, or a Heathen: Some of them, I have rea&s;on to think, &s;incerely pity the per&s;e|cutions I &s;uffer, as well from zealous, reviling pens and tongues, as from want of a mini&s;ter and &s;acraments, which my con|&s;cience and rea&s;on direct me to; the want of confirmation for my children, and a ruler of my church, to whom I might ap|peal upon occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now I think all di&s;&s;enters ought to be of the &s;ame compa&s;&s;ion|ate di&s;po&s;ition, and as we ought not to envy them the privi|leges they enjoy, &s;o ought they to be willing that we &s;hould en|joy privileges equal to theirs. Since the church has been &s;o ex|tremely indulgent, as to &s;uffer them without mole&s;tation or re|&s;traint, to enjoy almo&s;t the whole power of <HI>America,</HI> they ought to &s;hew them&s;elves worthy of this indulgence, by ap|pearing the readie&s;t people in the world to remove the &s;hameful oppre&s;&s;ion which lies upon us: By doing this, they will &s;hew a laudable gratitude, will e&s;tabli&s;h a permanent unity betwixt
<PB N="430" REF="010857_0216_0F851D9729506E68">them&s;elves and us, and will induce our &s;uperiors in <HI>Europe</HI> to &s;ecure them a perpetual enjoyment of their pre&s;ent advantages; perhaps to extend greater favours to them.</P>
<P>If &s;ome late de&s;igns, which have been &s;ugge&s;ted to me, &s;hould &s;ucceed, I am certain that <HI>America</HI> would not be a hap|py place even for Di&s;&s;enters of any denomination whatever: For &s;uppo&s;e that all epi&s;copal clergymen &s;hould for the future, be prevented from landing in <HI>America,</HI> by threats of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion (as it is &s;o often boa&s;ted the bi&s;hop is prevented, and if the bi&s;hop can be thus prevented, why not the cler|gy?) would that oblige us to come under an <HI>Anti-epi&s;|copal American</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hment, or into the Pre&s;byterian Com|munion? No, if the church in <HI>Virginia, Maryland, New-York,</HI> or even <HI>Connecticut,</HI> &s;hould fall, &s;he will fall like a per&s;on of &s;trength and courage. However lukewarm and indifferent churchmen may <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> appear, you will find that we have no reli&s;h for mean Kirk-Slavery, nor any Inclination to be dealt with like the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> in the la&s;t century. We will &s;ooner die by their &s;words in war, or flee to <HI>Sweden. Denmark,</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> for protection, than be drag|ged by Kirk-Officers to their <HI>Cutty Stool,</HI> or &s;ee our friends, the peaceable and benevolent <HI>Quarkers,</HI> hang'd or whipt at the cart's tail thro' three towns of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing every denomination of Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould concur (as I think they will not) in extirpating the Church; would there not en&s;ue as much jealou&s;y and &s;trife among different &s;ects again&s;t each other, as there now is in &s;ome &s;ects again&s;t the Church? It is well known, that the mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ers of the Church in the middle colonies, defire to introduce an e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m:</HI> To the &s;ucce&s;s of this plan, they imagine the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment of the kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> will greatly contribute; for with regard to religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> are two di&s;tinct kingdoms as much as ever they were.</P>
<P>In all <HI>New-England,</HI> there are but eleven <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Con|gregations; whil&s;t there are thirty <HI>Quaker</HI> Churches, thirty|nine <HI>Anabapti&s;t,</HI> about 50 Separati&s;t Churches, about eighty congregations of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and 586 Congrega|tional meetings. Were all the Church people ma&s;&s;acred, or put to death by per&s;ecuting <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> laws, is it probable that the other 700 religious a&s;&s;emblies would peaceably &s;ubmit their necks to the yokes of <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Tyranny? 'Tis madne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e they would; indeed they have on all occa&s;ions peremptorily declared that they would not. Neither can I think the numerous <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will ever indulge the encroaching, per&s;ecuting &s;cheme, of <HI>American</HI> Pre&s;byte|ries.
<PB N="431" REF="010857_0216_0F851D9729506E68">Whatever the Anabapti&s;t or Dutch Calvini&s;t Churches may do (both which the <HI>Whigs</HI> are by every Stratagem attempt|ing to bring gradually and imperceptibly into the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> re|ligion) it is very unlikely the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches will ever put their neeks into the Synod's yoke.</P>
<P>The leading men of the <HI>American</HI> Di&s;&s;enters plainly appear to have a &s;ettled de&s;ign of <HI>clearing America from epi&s;copal er|rors,</HI> as their phra&s;e is; the fir&s;t &s;tep of which work is, to pre|vent by menaces, our having a bi&s;hop to ordain for us; the next &s;tep will doubtle&s;s be to forbid all Church Clergymen landing in <HI>America:</HI> Then perhaps we &s;hall be forbid the U&s;e of the common prayer, as in <HI>Cromwell's</HI> Time; and at la&s;t be bani&s;h|ed on pain of death, like the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>New-England.</HI> And what con&s;equence can be expected from the&s;e happy proceedings? What but mutual railings. envy and per&s;ecution among the numerous, zealous and widely differing &s;ects? Therefore for the benefit of di&s;&s;enters as well as Church-men, I pray God to de|feat the plots of &s;uch cruel <HI>American Whigs</HI> "as turn religion "into rebellion, and &s;aith into faction."</P>
