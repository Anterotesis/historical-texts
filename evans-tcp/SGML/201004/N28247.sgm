But without any vi&s;ible effect on the minds of their children until the February follow|ing, when on one Friday evening Elizabeth Lull, wife of Benjamin Lull, jun. aro&s;e from her bed in great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, and coming down &s;tairs &s;he repeated the following words:</P>
<Q><L>"Shall Simon bear thy cro&s;s alone,</L>
<L>"And other &s;aints go free;</L>
<L>"Each &s;aint of thine &s;hall find his own,</L>
<L>"And there is one for me."</L></Q>
<P>"I have lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">teen years; and never had a good thought, &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e a good word&punc; or did a good deed." This made an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of her &s;i&s;ter Martha, and likewi&s;e upon her hu&s;band. Thus the work of the Lord began. Ebenezer Knap was gone from home<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He went away from home in December, and returned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd they had no earthly in&s;tructor than their mother. They contin|ued in this exerci&s;e of mind until April, when Mrs. Lull and her &s;i&s;|ter Martha were brought into liberty. In the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;ummer &s;even more families moved into the &s;ettlement and united with them in their religious meetings. This &s;ummer was a com|fortable time with them, in the former part of which Increa&s;e Thur&s;|tin's wife was brought to rejoice in the Lord, together with C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leb Lull&punc; &s;on of Benjamin Lull, &s;enior, and many others appeared under deep exerci&s;es of mind on account of their &s;ouls. It continued a com|fortable &s;ea&s;on with them until the &s;ummer following.</P>
<P>In June 1775, one Jack&s;on was killed by an Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on the Butter|nut
<PB N="4" REF="037650_0004_100F7B6966697B18">Creek about two miles from the &s;ettlement; it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Indian murd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed him for his money.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1776, the inhabitants began to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the war, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e more peace until they were deprived of mo&s;t of their ef|fects and forced to break up their &s;ettlement and retire to the interior of the country.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year a party of men were &s;ent by the au|thority of the &s;tate, who obliged the inhabitants to take the oath of neutr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ity and di&s;armed them.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1777, a party of the Briti&s;h came into the &s;ettlement, and obliged the inhabitants to &s;wear not to take up arms again&s;t the King of Britain.</P>
<P>In 1778, in con&s;equence of a &s;u&s;picion that the inhabitants had vio|la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d their oath, and &s;upplied the enemy with provi&s;ion. Two com|panies were &s;ent from the garri&s;on at Cherry. Valley, who took the principal men pri&s;oners, and drove away all the cattle they could find: The pri&s;oners were carried to Cherry-Valley and examined, then &s;ent to Albany and confined. In September the &s;ame year a party of the Oneida Indians came and took away all the men that were left except one who was ab&s;ent; and carried them to Fort Stanwix, and delivered them as pri&s;oners to the garri&s;on under pretence that they took them on their way to Niagara. The women and children were now left alone &s;urrounded by ho&s;tile &s;avages and howling bea&s;t of prey.</P>
<P>In a few days after the Indians were gone, Elizabeth, the wife Benjamin Lull, &s;enior being deprived of her family (which con&s;i&s;ted of her hu&s;band and five &s;ons, who were all taken pri&s;oners) formed the re&s;olution of leaving the place; accordingly &s;he &s;et out (accompanied with another woman, who carried with her two &s;mall children) through the wood for Cherry-Valley, where they arrived after two days tra|vel, in which they endured great di&s;tre&s;s, on account of the ruggedne&s;s of the way, continual fears of the enemy, and the inclemency of the weather, for a great part of the time it rained exceeding hard, and at night they took up their lodging in an old hut and made their bed of &s;ome oat-&s;traw. The di&s;tance they travelled was about thirty-two miles. Mrs. Lull was at this time about 57 years of age, and car|ried a pack that was judged to weigh about thirty weight.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after this the pri&s;oners were relea&s;ed, as there was nothing found again&s;t them. They immediately removed their fami|lies back into the old &s;ettlements. Thus were the&s;e people driven from their habitations after pa&s;&s;ing through &s;cenes of anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s, which mu&s;t affect the feeling heart with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>But through all their di&s;tre&s;s and danger, kind providence protected them, &s;o that no lives were lo&s;t except Jack&s;on's afore&s;aid. In 1783 Benjamin Lull with his wife and one &s;on returned to the &s;ettlement and lived alone through the winter.</P>
<P>In 1784, four more families returned. In 1785 they again &s;et up religious meetings. About the year 1787, they had preaching part of
<PB N="5" REF="037650_0005_100F7B6B66D0D808">the time and &s;ome were baptized by Elder Com&s;tock who had collect|ed a &s;mall church in Cooper's patent, but he dying &s;oon 'after, his church became extinct.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1792, Elder Craw from Greenfield vi&s;ited them, preach|ed and baptized two per&s;ons; May 16, 1793 a number of Bapti&s;t profe&s;&s;ors met at the hou&s;e of Mr. Jo&s;eph Lull, in Unadilla for con|ferences after an agreeable interview in which they found a union of &s;entiment re&s;pecting doctrine and di&s;cipline, they adjourned their meeting.</P>
<P>June 1793, they again met and after further conver&s;ation they read and adopted a covenant, and agreed to call a council.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 28th, 1793 a council con&s;i&s;ting of the Elder and delegates from Greefield church met, and after in&s;pecting their doings, gave them fellow&s;hip as a church in &s;i&s;ter relation: Their number was five males, and five females. This church lies &s;outhwe&s;terly from Spring|field about thirty five miles.</P>
<P>Ebenezer Knap and his wife are yet members of the church and they have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing their two daughters (their only &s;ur|viving children) one of their &s;ons in law, and &s;ix of their grand chil|dren) in the &s;ame church with them.</P>

<P>IN 1787 there was a collection of nine Babti&s;t profe&s;&s;ors in the town of Springfield, but were not regularly organized as a church: they continued in this &s;ituation until 1789, when Elder Furman re|moved to that place, who&s;e labor in the Go&s;pel (by the divine ble&s;&s;|ing) proved &s;ucce&s;sful. In February the &s;ame year the work of the Lord began, and on the 13th day of March following Elder Furman, with twenty more, united with them in Covenant, and now con&s;idered them&s;elves a go&s;pel church, and in the words of Elder Furman, "this was a beautiful &s;ight, a glorious day in the wilderne&s;s." They were now thirty in number walking together in union and harmony: This was the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t Church erected in this once howling de&s;ert. The work of God &s;till continued and before the end of January following, thirty-&s;ix more were added to the church.</P>
<P>In 1793 God again vi&s;ited them with a &s;mall revival, and &s;even were added to the church.</P>
<P>In 1796 the Lord was plea&s;ed to pour out his &s;pirit among them again, and fourteen were added to the church. This church from the beginning has been in a flouri&s;hing condition, and favored with additions yearly. Elder Furman &s;till continues his labours among them, and we have received information that God is again vi&s;iting them, and a work of reformation is going on in that place.</P>

At a certain time a number of rude per|&s;ons made an agreement to break up their meeting; but before the time came they were convinced of the impropriety of &s;uch conduct, and de&s;i&s;ted from their purpo&s;e. About this time they were involved in &s;ome trials by rea&s;on of fal&s;e brethren, who came in among them. In the years 1792 and 1793 &s;ome mini&s;ters vi&s;ited them, a &s;mall ref|ormation took place and five per&s;ons were baptized. In 1794 &s;ever|al profe&s;&s;ors moved into the place and united with them in the wor|&s;hip of God. In 1795 they met and gave a relation of their chri&s;tian experience to each other, and obtained fellow&s;hip, agreed upon articles and covenant, and voted to &s;end for a council. Augu&s;t 20th 1795 A council con&s;i&s;ting of Springfield and Franklin churches convened and gave them fellow&s;hip as a church. Their number was 15. It lies &s;outh we&s;terly from Springfield di&s;tant about thirty-five miles.</P>

<P>IN the year 1789 Elder William Furman removed with his fam|ily into the town of Springfield, in the county of Ot&s;ego, &s;tate of New-York. This town lies at the north end of Ot&s;ego lake, and a|bout 15 miles &s;outh of Mohawk river; and about 60 miles we&s;t of Albany. At this time there was no B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pti&s;t church in all this exten&s;ive country. Eld'r Furman was at this time about forty years of age, he is of a middling &s;tatute, robu&s;t con&s;titution, fitted to endure hard&s;hips, naturally of a mild and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, affable in conver&s;ation, meek and winning in his preaching; &s;ound in doctrine, in exhortation ex|cels, his gifts &s;eem to be mo&s;tly of the exhortative kind; yet, he is capable of handling a text doctrinally to the &s;atisfaction of the lovers
<PB N="10" REF="037650_0010_100F7B7829254B70">of truth. He is of deep penetration and &s;ound judgment, which ren|ders him eminently u&s;eful in councils. He was the fir&s;t mini&s;ter who was &s;ettled in this wilderne&s;s, who was particularly u&s;eful in planting churches and promoting the ri&s;e of this A&s;&s;ociation. Having the glory of God in view, and de&s;irous of the increa&s;e of the Redeemer's kingdom, he &s;pared no pains, but exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t for the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e glorious purpo&s;es. He may with pro|priety be &s;aid to be the father of the&s;e churches, God has remarkably ble&s;&s;ed his labors with abundant &s;ucce&s;s. He now rejoices to &s;ee the happy effects of his unwearied pains in the &s;ervice of his Lord.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1794 he propo&s;ed to the churches to meet in a conference, to con&s;ult the propriety of forming an A&s;&s;ociation of the&s;e churches. Accordingly &s;even churches met by their delegates on the 4th day of September 1794, at the hou&s;e of B'r Wm. Goff, in Burlington. Eld'rs Werden, Cornell and Craw, belonging to the Shaft&s;bury A&s;&s;ociation being pre&s;ent, took &s;eat with them. After an agreeable conference on the &s;ubject, they adjourned until the 2nd Thur&s;day in January, 1795, to meet at the hou&s;e of Paul Gardner, in Burlington.</P>
<P>January 8th, 1795, the churches again met pur&s;uant to adjourn|ment, and two more were added. Sentiments of an A&s;&s;ociation and the platform thereof were read, and agreed to refer them to the chur|ches, reque&s;ting them to appoint delegates to meet at the meeting hou&s;e in Springfield, on the 2d day of September next, inve&s;ted with power to decide on the propriety of forming an A&s;&s;ociation.</P>

<P>Sermon by Eld'r Cornell from Timothy 11.3. After a &s;hort in|termi&s;&s;ion proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s. A Platform and plan of union for the&s;e churches was read and unanimou&s;ly agreed upon.</P>
<P>The delicate circum&s;tances in which the infant churches, in this ex|ten&s;ive territory were placed, rendered them liable to impo&s;itions from artful and de&s;igning men; and &s;everal &s;uch of dangerous principles and corrupt practices having already obtruded them&s;elves upon the&s;e new &s;ettlements, it became indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome method &s;hould be devi&s;ed to prevent &s;uch impo&s;itions in future, and to keep out of our connexion all per&s;ons &s;u&s;taining &s;uch characters. There|fore the conference appointed Eld. Cornell to examine each church re&s;pecting their faith and practice, and each mini&s;ter concerning his character. After which the aforementioned churches and mini&s;ter being found in a circum&s;tance to unite, they UNANIMOUSLY vo|ted to con&s;ider them&s;elves at this and future meetings as an A&s;&s;ocia|tion, by the name of the Ot&s;ego A&s;&s;ociation. The Elders and breth|ren pre&s;ent gave them fellow&s;hip as an A&s;&s;ociation.</P>

<P>Voted to meet annually on the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day in September at 10 o'Clock A. M.</P>
<P>This being the fir&s;t interview of this nature ever enjoyed in this we&s;tern country, it was apparently crowned with a divine ble&s;&s;ing &mdash; The pre&s;ence of Jehovah was really felt, and the &s;ouls of God's peo|ple expanded with joy, Some who came to the meeting with a re&s;o|lution to oppo&s;e the forming of an A&s;&s;ociation, were con&s;trained to ac|knowledge that God was with them; and their &s;ouls rejoiced in the union of the&s;e infant churches. Indeed it was a plea&s;ing and intere&s;t|ing &s;cene, to behold the little churches &s;cattered thoughout this exten|&s;ive land, coming up out of the wilderne&s;s and uniting together in an A&s;&s;ociate capacity, thereby exhibiting what the Lord had done and was &s;till doing in this once howling de&s;ert.</P>

<P>IN the year 1776, David Fowler and five others moved to the we&s;tward of Albany, having previou&s;ly obtained acce&s;&s;ion of lands from the Oneida Indians: upon which they &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> formed a &s;ettle|ment, and &s;et up a religious meeting, which was carried on by &s;ing|ing, praying, and exhortation. In the time of the revolutionary war, they were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, being deprived of their cattle and mo&s;t of their other effects; &s;o that they were forced to break up their &s;ettlement and retire to the older towns. At the con|clu&s;ion of the war they returned to their former habitations; &s;oon after a di&s;pute aro&s;e between them and the Oneidas concerning their lands; which was productive of much trouble: many other difficul|ties they met with from the Engli&s;h on account of their land, which were di&s;couraging; but the providence of God protected them.</P>
<P>Through all their trials they kept up their religious meetings; and on the 24th of May, 1798 four per&s;ons were baptized by Eld. Par|&s;ons, and they agreed to &s;end for a council. Augu&s;t 23d 1798, a council con&s;i&s;ting of the churches in Fairfield-Palatine, Paris, Whites|town, Scuyler &amp; White&s;town, and Hamilton, convened, who after in|quiring into their circum&s;tances, gave them fellow&s;hip as a church of Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their number was twelve.

Nov. 27th, 1798, they agreed to call a council to give them fellow&s;hip; and likewi&s;e agreed to give Eld. Butler a call to &s;ettle with them.

<HEAD>BUTTERNUTS.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 17th of January 1798, B'r John Lawton moved into the town of Butternuts, in con&s;equence of a reque&s;t of the bapti&s;t church there: the church at that time was few in number: a good degree of harmony prevailing a|mong them at this time: but not &s;o great an engagedne&s;s in religion as could be wi&s;hed; and a great neglect of the duties of religion was prevalent among them; but &s;till there were &s;ome de&s;ires for more engagedne&s;s in the cau&s;e of truth. Early in the &s;pring there was &s;ome &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s apparent on the minds &s;ome of the youth, but it was &s;oon gone: However the truth made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions, the minds of profe&s;&s;ors &s;eemed to be more and more impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to religious duties: and de&s;ires were encrea&s;ed for the out-pouring of the holy &s;pirit. Thus it continued until Lords day Augu&s;t 26th 1798, when one was excluded the church privileges, for immoral conduct. This was a &s;olemn &s;cene, it being the fir&s;t ca&s;e of that nature in the church. The members were deeply affected, and the audience in general appeared &s;ol|emn and attentive: about this time information was received of the reforma|tion on the Otego creek. Lords day, September 26th 1798, was a &s;olemn day; in the meeting, the power of the Lord &s;eemed to be pre&s;ent; and a num|ber of youth and other per&s;ons &s;eemed to be greatly alarmed, while the people of God much encouraged. About this time a young woman gave a relation of
<PB N="32" REF="037650_0032_100F7BBEB6D32BE8">the work of God on her &s;oul, and was received for Bapti&s;m. Several per&s;ons were now under deep exerci&s;es of mind. October 10th, Elder Ho&s;mer preached a &s;ermon from I. Peter 111, 12. and baptized four per&s;ons. This was a &s;olemn time, the arm of the Lord was revealed, and the glory of God di&s;played: the tongues of God's children were loo&s;ed, and their &s;ouls were filled with joy and gladne&s;s: while &s;inners were expre&s;&s;ing their concern with many tears and &s;igns, fobs and groans were heard on every &s;ide: but notwith|&s;tanding the powerful operators many were pa&s;&s;ing under, yet there was no appearance of any wild enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal: But a national concern agitated the minds of &s;inners, while the children of God &s;eemed to rejoice from having r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght apprehen&s;ions of the truth; order and regu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arity appeared through all the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eting.</P>
<P>On the 25th of October, B'r Lawton was ordained, and the Lord's day fol|lowing baptized eleven per&s;ons.

<P>In the latter end of the year 1798 a B'r Price vi&s;ited the church in Hamil|ton. His preaching was ble&s;&s;ed of God and a glorious work took place in dif|ferent parts of the town.

His conver&s;ation togeth|er with the former preaching (B'r Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce being now ab&s;ent) had &s;uch an effect that a number of youth under deep impre&s;&s;ions left their &s;chool and went to &s;ee the afore&s;aid young man who was &s;till laboring under great di&s;tre&s;s of mind.

<PB N="35" REF="037650_0035_100F7BC6229879D0">
<HEAD>SOME GENERAL REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been particular in noting the day when the churches were formed, and by whom they were received into fellow&s;hip, that we may give the reader &s;ome idea of their circum&s;tances in the in|fant &s;tate of the country, and when there were but &s;ew in habitants to what there is now. The &s;ettlements were very &s;mall and &s;cattered o|ver a great extent of country: many of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers were the pro|fe&s;&s;ed children of God, but in general they became back&s;liders: the difficulties of &s;ettling a new and uncultivated country, the hard&s;hips they endured, and the want of opportunities to attend on religious meetings, may be a&s;&s;igned as part of the rea&s;ons for this declen&s;ion. God permitted them in &s;ome mea&s;ure to overcome the &s;tubbornne&s;s of the country, and then was plea&s;ed to recall the wan|dering of their minds. The reformations began with tho&s;e back&s;li|ders, and was attended with power on the hearts of tho&s;e that knew not God; and yet the village perhaps &s;o &s;mall that all might meet in a &s;mall log hou&s;e, and if the &s;hower extended further, a log barn or an adjacent wood formed their place of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Our brethren in the old towns and cities have &s;ept abroad accounts of the wonderful work of God among them, but if we take a com|parative view of the numbers, if ten in our &s;mall villages are brought to the knowledge of the truth, it is more in proportion than an hun|dred in &s;ome of tho&s;e places: but in &s;ome places, where the &s;ettle|ments have been of earlier date, it has been &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the num|bers collected, in&s;tances have been known of two or three hundred people convening at a weekly lecture. None of the&s;e churches are of longer &s;tanding than about &s;even years (excepting Springfield church,) which time is &s;hort for the extraordinary increa&s;e, which is about four times the number &s;ince the a&s;&s;ociation formed, which is a|bout five years. There are yet a number of churches in Onondaga and Ontario counties which have formed a conference among them|&s;elves, concerning which we have been able to obtain little or no in|formation; a number of reformations have taken place there under the preaching of our fellow laborer Elder David Iri&s;h an account of which we cannot obtain before this goes to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have given an account by whom the&s;e churches were received into fellow&s;hip, that we might inform the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eader of the union that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> taken place, and the care there has been both in mini&s;ters and church|es, to guard again&s;t errors in doctrine and practice: it is worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;ervation that the loo&s;e manner in which the laws of the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> New-York concerning the fir&s;t day of the week were execu&s;ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|gether with the mixture of inhabitants of different &s;entiments, al|mo&s;t overthrew the ob&s;ervation of the day; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ce&s;&s;ary that the religious ob&s;ervation of the fir&s;t day, &s;hould be eni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n|ed on the churches at their formation, and made an article in their covenant, and that every head of a family &s;hould &s;et up the wor&s;hip of God, dy vocal prayer in their hou&s;es.</P>

<P>In June 1795, Eld'r A&s;hoal Ho&s;mer removed his family to Bor|lington and began to labor, in connexion with Eld'rs Butler and For|man, who&s;e friend&s;hip to him as a &s;tranger and unu&s;ed to the woods, he is ever ready to acknowledge.

<P>After the formation of the A&s;&s;ociation, Eld'r Roots came into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> country, who&s;e indu&s;try is be&s;t icon by an extract from his journal, which we here &s;ubjoin:&mdash;"In December 1795, I came to Litchfield, in the &s;tate of New-York. in con&s;equence of an invitation which I re|ceived Elder Ho&s;mer of Burlington, who had been de&s;ired by the baptift at Litchfield to engage &s;ome preacher to come among them. About the fir&s;t of January 1796, I agreed to preach at Litchfield one half of the time for one year. During this year I rode and preached in many places; and in the month<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of October, I rode as far as the Gene&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e River and preached thirty two times;" &s;ince which time Eld'r Roots has married in this country, has removed his re&s;idence to Hamilton, obtained a letter of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church in Bo&s;ton, joined with the fir&s;t church in Hamilton and continues his labors in that and adjacent places.</P>
<P>In the year 1796, the church in Franklin, having obtained a di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion from the Shaft&s;bury A&s;&s;ociation, united with us, which added Eld'r James Bacon to our number, who&s;e unwearied labors, notwith|&s;tanding his advanced age, has been a &s;ource of great comfort to churches and mini&s;ters.

At the next A&s;&s;ociation, he, with Eld'r Lake of Kertright, joined and in|crea&s;ed our &s;trength. Shortly after this, Stephen Taylor was ordain|ed in the third church in Burlington, and continues his labors with that church and ocea&s;ionally with others to good acceptance. The next year, John Lawton was ordained in the Butlernut church, and conti|nues with them at pre&s;ent, and of a truth we may &s;ay the Lord has done great things for us, whereof we are glad. The extent of this a&s;|&s;ociation from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about one hundred and forty miles, &amp; from north to &s;outh about 60. The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociation was holden in a meet|inghou&s;e, built by the bapti&s;ts and congregationali&s;ts in Springfield, the &s;econd mo&s;tly in the woods, the third in a barn, the fourth and fifth in dwelling hou&s;es; and in all the&s;e the pre&s;ence of the Lord has more than made up the want of convenience.

<P>"IN compliance with your reque&s;t, I &s;end you an account re&s;pect|ing religion in this new &s;ettlement in the &s;ummer of 1796, being de&s;|titute of preaching a number of &s;erious per&s;ons agreed to meet togeth|er on the &s;abbath, to read and pray together, which was ever after attended to. In the winter of 1797 religious conferences were &s;et up and attended to weekly, although the number very &s;mall, part of the not more than one male exclu&s;ive of the family where the meeting was held would attend. Although very di&s;couraging, yet they were continued. A mo&s;t remarkable &s;tupidity appeared among the peo|ple. About the beginning of Autumn 1797, there was one woman under &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of mind; and I tru&s;t &s;he was born again as &s;he gives evidence of the new birth. The 9th of June, 1798, a church was gathered here by the Rev. Mr. S&mdash; which con&s;i&s;ted of 13 members, which had belonged to other churches; there has been ad|ditions made until its number was 24, &s;ince which two have moved away.</P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;ummer, 1799, &s;everal per&s;ons appeared to be under &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions of mind; the work gradually increa&s;ed till about the la&s;t of October, when there appeared an uncommon &s;o|lemnity on the countenances of people, &amp; a number were &s;truck under &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions: Nearly at the &s;ame time in No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ember, three per|&s;ons were propounded to the church, and la&s;t &s;abbath 17 more; and more I expect will &s;hortly come forward and confe&s;s Chri&s;t before the world. At pre&s;ent the awakening appears to be at a &s;tand: This work has been remarkable on account of the &s;teadine&s;s of the people: nothing of the enthu&s;ia&s;tic nature has appeared; God is a &s;overeign, he has taken &s;ome of the mo&s;t unlikely per&s;ons to human appearance; grey headed and middle-aged, and mo&s;tly pa&s;&s;ed by the youth. Oh, my friend I mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat your prayers to Almighty God for us, that he would continue to pour out his &s;pirit more and more a|mong us, and not pa&s;s by the youth, and that it may &s;pread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, from heart to heart, from &s;tate to &s;tate, and from na|tion to nation; till the glory of the Lord covers the earth as the wa|ter does the &s;ea: which is the &s;incere prayer of your friend.</P>
