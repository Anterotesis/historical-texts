<HEAD>LETTER. I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH plea&s;ure I take my pen to an&s;wer the que&s;tions you put to me. What is the RIGHT and POWER of Congregational Churches, <HI>to choo&s;e their Officers; to exerci&s;e Di&s;cipline; and to remove their Of|ficers from their Office, according to the</HI> CAMBRIDGE PLATFORM?</P>
<P>The&s;e enquiries are truly of importance: &s;ince peo|ple appear to be divided in their &s;entiments about them.</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hall not be able to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to your que&s;tions; but, &s;ince you have de&s;ir|ed it, I will give you my idea of the &s;ubject, which I have acquired by attending to the principles and prac|tice of Congregational Churches, as I find them by their writers, both before and &s;ince their Platform, as well as the Platform it&s;elf. This you will allow is a ju&s;t way to determine the <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> by the Platform; as tho&s;e who compo&s;ed, and practi&s;ed upon it, mu&s;t be allowed to be the be&s;t interpreters of it.</P>
<P>And though the Platform was compo&s;ed by men under very different circum&s;tances from what we are in this day; and having a different phra&s;eology, and it being but &s;hort and &s;ummary; there is &s;ome ob&s;cur|ity
<PB N="4" REF="026757_0003_0FD1C22B4B046F40">
as to the meaning of it, in all its parts; yet, by re|curring to the writings of tho&s;e who lived in tho&s;e days, we may find what their principles and practice were, and learn what the meaning and extent of the Platform is.</P>
<P>You a&s;k, what is the <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of Congrega|tional Churches to choo&s;e their officers, &amp;c. Many people &s;eem to blend the&s;e together, as if whatever any one has <HI>power</HI> to do, he has <HI>right</HI> to do al&s;o. But you will readily grant there is a di&s;tinction to be made. Per&s;ons may have a <HI>right</HI> to have, or to do things, which they have not <HI>power</HI> to do or perform: &s;o al&s;o per&s;ons have <HI>power</HI> to do many things which they have no <HI>right</HI> to do, el&s;e there could be no &s;uch thing as evil works. Thus a thief has <HI>power</HI> to &s;teal, to take &s;ome of my property from me; a ruffian may have <HI>power</HI> to wound and murder me; a &s;landerer may have <HI>power</HI> to de&s;troy my character, and innumerable ways men may have <HI>power</HI> to hurt and wrong one an|other. But perhaps no one will in earne&s;t pretend he has any <HI>right</HI> to injure his neighbour.</P>
<P>This may be applied to Churches: If they are &s;up|po&s;ed to have <HI>right</HI> to do every thing, they have <HI>pow|er</HI> to do; the enquiry is wholly at an end, what is their <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power;</HI> becau&s;e, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, they cannot do any thing wrong; and this, as extrava|gant as it is, &s;eems to be the real &s;entiment of &s;ome; what el&s;e can be made of the profe&s;&s;ed &s;entiment and practice of tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ert that a Church may do as they plea&s;e and not be re&s;pon&s;ible, or under any check or control whatever? The&s;e however call them&s;elves Congregationali&s;ts, and &s;ometimes they will &s;ay they are <HI>Independents,</HI> as if both were the &s;ame thing. But the
<PB N="5" REF="026757_0004_0FD1C22CC1A40F28">
idea I have conceived of tho&s;e two denominations, by examining the writings of the founders of CONGRE|GATIONALISM, is, that they are as different one from the other; as the &s;y&s;tem of religion and policy, by Mo&s;es, was, from the confu&s;ion of Babel. Tho&s;e of Babel &s;cattered into parties; and every per&s;on or party, did as they plea&s;ed, <HI>independent</HI> of each other. The &s;y&s;tem of policy by Mo&s;es was a well connected &s;cheme, wherein was a proper &s;ubordination and check upon every individual family, and tribe; being re&s;pon&s;ible to each other for their conduct; with as much liberty to every individual as the pre&s;ent &s;tate admits of.</P>
<P>This is my idea of Congregationali&s;m; it is a con+nected &s;cheme, and, if well adhered to, would produce great beauty and order.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee that, in my an&s;wer to your que&s;tions, I &s;hall not content my&s;elf in &s;aying what Churches will do, or have power to do; but what they have both <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to do: and this leads to enquire into the nature and con&s;titution of Congregational Church|es, which will be the &s;ubject of my following letters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER. II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE definition of a Congregational Church, as I find it by the Platform and other writers, is, <HI>a number of profe&s;&s;ing believers in Chri&s;t, &s;uch as can conveniently congregate together for wor&s;hip, covenanting and confed|erating together to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026757_0005_0FD1C2345ED9A0F8">This contains all his wor&s;hip and ordinances; the &s;a|craments and di&s;cipline of his hou&s;e; which con&s;i&s;ts in a friendly watch over each other, and u&s;ing &s;uch means as Chri&s;t, the King, has in&s;tituted for the reclaiming and recovering of &s;uch as have fallen into any fault: and purging out or rejecting &s;uch as, after &s;uch means are u&s;ed with them as Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted for their re-recovery, continue incorrigible.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription of a Church, excludes from it eve|ry thing of the nature of legi&s;lation. They covenant to execute laws <HI>already</HI> made by Chri&s;t, the King; and no other. They cannot therefore, make any thing a crime, which is not made &s;o in God's word. Neither may they take any other method of proceeding, than what Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted: if they do, they go out of their province, profane the name of Chri&s;t, pretending to do that as a Church of Chri&s;t, i. e. in his name, which he has not in&s;tituted. It would be as great an impro|priety for any Church to undertake to do thus; as it would be for any member of the judicial or executive authority in America, to undertake to execute the laws and cu&s;toms of the piratical Algerines. And as much wor&s;e for any Church to do thus, as much more hei|nou&s;ly impious, as Chri&s;t the Lord, in who&s;e name they pretend to act, is greater than the authority of the American nation.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a covenanting together, is what con&s;ti|tutes a Church, was the idea of the founders of Con|gregational Churches in this country, appears by oth|er writers as well as the Platform. Mr. Hooker, who was in the highe&s;t repute for his piety, learning, and political genius, both in Europe and America, who early emigrated into this country, and after a &s;hort
<PB N="7" REF="026757_0006_0FD1C2377AE7BA28">
&s;tay at Newtown, near Bo&s;ton; he, with &s;ome planters, went to Connecticut River, to Hartford, there they be|gan a new colony, which, with the colony of Newha|ven, is now the State of Connecticut. It is &s;aid that Mr. Hooker in&s;tituted &s;uch a tran&s;cendent &s;y&s;tem of &s;tate policy and laws for the colony, as that, when they applied to the Crown for a charter, their con&s;titution and laws commanded the admiration, a&s;toni&s;hment and applau&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;age coun&s;ellors in that old coun|try, which had for many ages been building on the po|licy of the Romans and politicians of the whole world. This great man wrote his <HI>Survey of Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> &s;ome years before the Platform was made; and if you compare, you will find the Platform was very much founded upon it.</P>
<P>In his Survey, Part 1, page 46, he &s;ays, "Mutual covenanting and confederating of Saints, in fellow&s;hip of the faith, according to the order of the Go&s;pel, is that which gives con&s;titution and being to the vi&s;ible Church." Again, &s;peaking of the &s;ame thing, <HI>"This Covenant is an engagement to walk in the ways of Chri&s;t."</HI> "This covenant (he &s;ays) may be either <HI>explicit</HI> or <HI>im|plicit.</HI> Explicit, when there is a formal <HI>covenant. Im|plicit,</HI> when they practi&s;e without a verbal, written, or formal covenant; yet is binding by their thus prac|ti&s;ing." Page 50, to &s;hew the rea&s;ons of a Church Covenant; he compares it to <HI>corporations</HI> for civil purpo&s;es. By the combination they have power over each other, for the purpo&s;es for which they are com|bined.</P>
<P>The &s;ame idea is fully expre&s;&s;ed in the Platform, Chap. iv. Sec. 1. "Saints, by calling, mu&s;t have a vi|&s;ible political union among them&s;elves; or el&s;e they
<PB N="8" REF="026757_0007_0FD1C237834B8D38">
are not yet a particular Church." Sec. 2d. "Particu|lar Churches cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another but by their forms.' Sec. 3d. "This form is a vi&s;ible covenant, agreement and con&s;ent, whereby they give them&s;elves unto the Lord, to the ob&s;erving of the or|dinances of Chri&s;t, together in the &s;ame &s;ociety; which is u&s;ually called the Church Covenant. For we &s;ee not otherwi&s;e how members can have power one over another." Again, Chap. vi, Sec. 1. "A church is a company of people combined together for the wor&s;hip of God."</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport, who was fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of Newhaven after he came into this country in 1639, afterward be|came Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church in Bo&s;ton, in his <HI>Pow|er of Congregational Churches,</HI> which he wrote about 18 years after the Platform, compares the Church to the <HI>natural body;</HI> to a body corporate; to a wife with her hu&s;band; and &s;ays, "All voluntary relations are by covenant." "Vi&s;ible privileges, powers, &amp;c. mu&s;t be by vi&s;ible confederation."</P>
<P>This covenant is for life, as e&s;&s;entially as the mar|riage covenant. Hence the Platform utterly di&s;ap|proves of per&s;ons for&s;aking the Church, Chap. xiii, Sec. 2d. "They who are joined with con&s;ent, &s;hould not depart without con&s;ent; except forced thereto." Which <HI>force,</HI> as explained by the Platform, and other writers, means per&s;onal or general per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>On this principle, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of New-England acted; they did not &s;eparate from the communion of the Church of England, but were driven out by per&s;e|cution, and brought this noble Chri&s;tian &s;pirit acro&s;s the Atlantic, and incorporated it into their Platform. This, I &s;aid, was a Chri&s;tian &s;pirit; for Chri&s;t him&s;elf
<PB N="9" REF="026757_0008_0FD1C23786E7BEF8">
never &s;eparated from the communion of the Jewi&s;h Church; though they were very corrupt and wicked in their principles and practices; but bore te&s;timony again&s;t them. I might add, that Martin Luther never &s;eparated from the Church of Rome, but &s;trove for a reformation; till he was driven out by the thunder|ing BULLS of the LATERAN: which he con&s;ider|ed as a di&s;&s;olution of his &s;olemn engagements. Thus he imitated his Lord and Ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which every Chri&s;tian is bound to do. And, I doubt not you will join with me, when I a&s;&s;ert, that for per&s;ons to &s;eparate from the Church, or withdraw from commun|ion with it, becau&s;e of &s;ome faults or errors, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, in opinion or practice, in the Pa&s;tor or &s;ome of the members, or indeed by the whole Church; is &s;chi&s;matical, antichri&s;tian, and a flagrant violation of covenant obligations, and &s;olemn vows.</P>
<P>The Platform con&s;iders this covenant bond &s;o indi&s;|&s;olvable, that, as it may not be broken by any part's &s;eparating; &s;o neither may the body of the Church di&s;|member any one. Chap. xiii, Sec. 7th. "The Church cannot make a member no member, but by excommunication."</P>
<P>This is not meant to preclude per&s;ons moving their habitations, when Providence calls thereto; but they are &s;till members of the &s;ame Church; until, by letters recommendatory, they move their particular relation from one particular church to another; and they are &s;till members of the Church by the &s;ame combination as long as they live, unle&s;s they &s;o violate their covenant as to forfeit it.</P>
<P>A forfeiture al&s;o di&s;&s;olves the marriage covenant and relation. And that God's Church, being formed
<PB N="10" REF="026757_0009_0FD1C239119C6C40">
by covenant, is of the &s;ame antiquity with the marriage covenant, Mr. Davenport a&s;&s;erts it was &s;o, even from ADAM.</P>
<P>As all covenants mu&s;t be ratified before witne&s;&s;es: and tho&s;e of great importance before &s;ome proper authority; &s;o, this covenant or combination of a Church, is to be &s;olemnized and ratified in pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es; and the authority of a Council of Churches; at lea&s;t of Pa&s;tors of churches; who con&s;ider the propriety of their thus covenanting, and combining in church &s;tate; as al&s;o the fitne&s;s of the covenant they propo&s;e; the members &s;ign the covenant in their pre&s;ence. And the Council of Churches, or Pa&s;tors, thus publickly own the new church, a new branch, or member added to the body of the Churches. And thus they are con&s;ociat|ed with the other churches, by covenant of fellow&s;hip and combination, in their very formation. Their cov|enant among them&s;elves and their con&s;ociation with oth|er churches, are blended and ratified by a mo&s;t religious &s;olemnization. See Platform, Chap. xv, Sec. 3d. and Mather's <HI>Ratio Di&s;ciplinae,</HI> page 8 and 9.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you my idea of the forma|tion of a Congregational Church; I &s;hall in my next give you my notion of the ORGANIZATION of a Church with officers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH a number of profe&s;&s;ing believ|ers combined together to ob&s;erve all things what&s;o|ever Chri&s;t has commanded, are a Church: yet they
<PB N="11" REF="026757_0010_0FD1C23A85CB5E30">
cannot perform what they have covenanted and com|bined for; without being ORGANIZED with Offi|cers.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t has, therefore, in&s;tituted Officers proper for the executing of all tho&s;e laws and ordinances which he has commanded.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e officers are, &s;eems to have undergone a variety of &s;entiments among Chri&s;tians of various denominations; and even among Congregationali&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. Hooker evidently &s;uppo&s;ed, there &s;hould be <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Teacher, Ruling Elders</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI> And the Platform is evidently compo&s;ed with the &s;ame idea. Yet the Synod which a&s;&s;embled at Bo&s;ton, in 1662, but 14 years after the Platform was made; in their re&s;ult a&s;&s;ert, that, <HI>"A Church with a teaching El|der have full power and authority, from the Lord Je&s;us, regularly to admini&s;ter all the ordinances of Chri&s;t."</HI> This being &s;o &s;oon after the Platform was made, there can be no doubt but that mo&s;t of the &s;ame men were in this Synod, that were in making the Platform. And this being done by the &s;ame authority, and mo&s;tly by the &s;ame per&s;ons the Platform was; may be con&s;ider|ed as an appendix to it, and of the &s;ame authority, in the&s;e churches with that: and the general practice of the&s;e churches, having been according to it, I &s;hall not enquire after any other ruling Officer in Chri&s;t's Church, be&s;ide a teaching Elder, Pa&s;tor, or Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>This Officer is to teach and admini&s;ter all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded. He is nece&s;&s;arily and e&s;&s;entially a Ruler; for rule, government, and authority, mu&s;t accompany a Teacher. Accordingly, the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are &s;poken of as <HI>Rulers in his Hou&s;e,</HI> frequently in the New-Te&s;tament: and Chri&s;t's
<PB N="12" REF="026757_0011_0FD1C23C2CBC06C0">
addre&s;&s;ing the Churches, by addre&s;&s;ing the Angel of the Church, is evidence that he con&s;iders it &s;o. Such an Officer is now certainly belonging to the Church of Chri&s;t, as appears from what he &s;ays, Matt. xxviii. <HI>Lo I am with you always to the end of the world.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Officer in&s;tituted in Chri&s;t's Church to take care of the temporalities thereof, who is called Deacon.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Officers appear plain, according to &s;crip|ture, to belong to the Church. But the fir&s;t is the principal one, without which the &s;piritual in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t's Kingdom cannot be executed. Which therefore will be the principal &s;ubject of enquiry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE in my former letter con&s;idered what Officers are e&s;&s;ential to the Church of Chri&s;t. I will now &s;ay &s;omething how a Church is to be furni&s;hed with tho&s;e Officers according to Congregational principles. I &s;hall &s;pecially attend to the fir&s;t, without which the Church is incapable of carrying into execution what they have covenanted and combined to do.</P>
<P>Here again are a variety of opinions and practices. Epi&s;copatians &s;uppo&s;e a National Church, of which the King, or Supreme Magi&s;trate, is head; who ap|points Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, having certain di&s;tricts or bi&s;hopricks, containing a number of par|i&s;hes, over which the Bi&s;hops appoint Curates, who
<PB N="13" REF="026757_0012_0FD1C23E293FAD58">
are to their &s;everal pari&s;hes the &s;ame as Mini&s;ters are to our congregations. But here is no &s;elect Church, therefore no covenant, neither with each other, nor with their teacher; and he receives all his official au|thority from the bi&s;hop who &s;end him. Here Church power and authority is derived from the King, prima|rily; and to the &s;everal orders from the higher dig|nitaries.</P>
<P>Pre&s;byterians &s;uppo&s;e that all eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority is in the Se&s;&s;ions, Pre&s;byteries, Synods and General A&s;|&s;embly: this la&s;t body is the highe&s;t authority in the Pre&s;byterian Church. They admit lay Elders; but the brotherhood have no more voice in choo&s;ing their officers, exerci&s;ing dicipline or removing their officers, than Epi&s;copalian pari&s;hes have in choo&s;ing their of|ficers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;chemes, or plans of church policy, the Con|gregationali&s;ts di&s;liked; &s;uppo&s;ing that they derived all church power and authority, both official and fra|ternal, directly from Chri&s;t; that they were not de|pendent on any &s;uperior order of men therefor. Hence they were called <HI>Independents.</HI> This they al&s;o di&s;liked, and expre&s;sly rejected; as may be found in many of the early writers of this country, and particu|larly is rejected in the Platform, Chap. ii, Sec. 5th. For they held &s;trong to a reciprocal dependence, du|ty and obligation upon, and toward each other: not only of members in the &s;ame congregation; but of Churches one upon, and to another. Hence one of their early writers, &s;aid of Congregational Churches, that they were INTERPENDENT.</P>
<P>But <HI>Independents</HI> admit of no &s;uch reciprocal obli|gation, connexion or dependence; and hold them&s;elves
<PB N="14" REF="026757_0013_0FD1C23FABEC6E38">
at a loo&s;e to do ju&s;t as they plea&s;e, without any check or control. They &s;ometimes affect to have connex|ion with Congregationali&s;ts, <HI>to &s;erve a turn,</HI> and when it &s;erves their <HI>turn</HI> will not admit they are connected. Wild enthu&s;ia&s;tic ranters, who do not admit ordina|ry Mini&s;ters, but that every one might pray, exhort, &amp;c. RAPIN THOYRAS, in his Hi&s;tory of England, calls <HI>Independents;</HI> this however need not be con&s;id|ered as incon&s;i&s;tent with calling any other di&s;orderly people <HI>Independents,</HI> for they are properly the &s;trange woman, Solomon &s;peaks of. "Her ways are movea|ble that thou can&s;t not know them," they are proper|ly an anarchy, a chaos; rather than any rule, order, or &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country were harra&s;&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two extremes, of <HI>Prelacy</HI> on the one hand, and &s;elfi&s;h, &s;elf &s;ufficient, ungoverned di&s;or|derly <HI>Independents</HI> on the other; and it is not to be wondered at, if their Platform is tinctured in phra&s;eo|logy with both; but e&s;pecially with the latter, to avoid the former, by which they were greatly per&s;ecuted. Yet in&s;pired with the generous and chri&s;tian principles of reciprocal duty, <HI>by love to &s;erve one of another,</HI> con&s;id|ering all Chri&s;t's Church as members one of another, members of the &s;ame body, having the &s;ame care one for another, that therefore all connexions and rela|tions in his kingdom are voluntary covenant combina|tions. They have con&s;idered, not only their embody|ing in church &s;tate, a covenant combination: but their organization with officers a covenant.</P>
<P>Thus Mr Hooker, "There is (&s;ays he) a particu|lar covenant between tho&s;e that choo&s;e, and tho&s;e that are cho&s;en' and &s;ays, <HI>"The relation between Pa&s;tor
<PB N="15" REF="026757_0014_0FD1C244A5050148">
and people is a covenant: that without this covenanting, there neither is, or ever was, or ever will be, a Pa&s;tor and Flock"</HI> Mr. Hooker further a&s;&s;erts, that "By choo&s;ing an officer they voluntarily &s;ubject them&s;elves to him, according to the laws and orders of Chri&s;t." The &s;ame &s;ays Mr. Davenport, "The relation between pa&s;tor and people is a covenant." The Platform is very full in the &s;ame idea, Chap. viii. The organiz|ing with officers is by the election of the Church and the acceptance of the per&s;on cho&s;en. Here is all the form and e&s;&s;ence of a covenant, a propo&s;al on the one part; and the acceptance of the propo&s;al on the other part. The Church choo&s;e him to be &s;uch an officer therein as Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted; they covenant and en|gage to &s;ubmit to him as &s;uch an officer. And he, by his acceptance, covenants and engages to be &s;uch an officer to them; &s;o it is a mutual covenant and engag|ment on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o, in the Congregational &s;y&s;tem, the corpo|rate body or pari&s;h, including the Church; by a cor|porate act concur with the Church in their election or choice; and make propo&s;als to the officer for his &s;up|port and maintenance, by which there is a parochial civil covenant and contract, blended with his office, to both Church and pari&s;h; by all which the Mini&s;ter's relation to his people, becomes a complex relation; formed by a triplicate covenant with them. This al&s;o is for life, for it is &s;o connected with the incorporating covenant of the Church, of which he is a member, and blended with his calling, which includes his local &s;itu|ation, that they cannot properly or con&s;i&s;tently be &s;e|parated; he is a member of the body, and covenants to be &s;uch a member. This complex covenant, when
<PB N="16" REF="026757_0015_0FD1C2482BE52308">
properly &s;olemnized, cannot be di&s;&s;olved; unle&s;s by con&s;ent of all parties concerned, or the Mini&s;ter for|feits it, by doing &s;omething incon&s;i&s;tent with his office, as Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted the office; for it is not for the Church to &s;ay what &s;hall belong to the office; they may not pre&s;ume to add to, or dimini&s;h from the duties or powers belonging thereto; for Chri&s;t has determin|ed the duties and powers of it. And it is not for the Church, or any man or order of men, to add to, or di|mini&s;h therefrom; if they do pre&s;ume any &s;uch thing, they expo&s;e them&s;elves, to have <HI>all the plagues added to them written in God's word; and to have their names taken away out of the Book of Life.</HI> Rev. xxii. 18, 19. This threatening in God's word, &s;hould make all very careful how they treat the laws of Chri&s;t, both as to his Mini&s;ters and all matters of di&s;cipline in his Church.</P>
<P>But though a &s;ingle Congregational Church hath both <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to choo&s;e and covenant with their of|ficer, i. e. Elder or Pa&s;tor. Or, as it is &s;ometimes term|ed, <HI>call</HI> to <HI>office;</HI> yet it cannot, according to &s;cripture, or Congregational principles or cu&s;tom, put into office.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in my next letter give you my idea of the Congregational principles and practice of inve&s;ting or puting into office.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I wrote you in my la&s;t letter, I &s;hall now &s;peak of ORDINATION, INSTALLATION, or <HI>putting in|to office.</HI></P>
<P>I find much di&s;pute has been about <HI>ordination.</HI> Some think it ought to be before <HI>election.</HI> I &s;hall not
<PB N="17" REF="026757_0016_0FD1C249A2838688">
enter that di&s;pute; it being foreign from my purpo&s;e; for if a man has been <HI>ordained,</HI> yet according to Con|gregational principles and practice, he mu&s;t be in&s;tall|ed in office where he &s;ettles; before he is con&s;idered as the officer in that place. In which every ceremo|ny is performed, which is in ordination, except <HI>the lay|ing on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery.</HI></P>
<P>This laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery in ordination, according to 1 Tim. iv. 14. is what is con|&s;idered as the ceremony confering the Pre&s;bytery, which Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted in his Church; &s;o that this is &s;omething di&s;tinct from, and independent of, the per&s;on's particular relation to any people.</P>
<P>But what I have to enquire after, is, the ordaining or in&s;talling a man in that office relation to a Con|gregation. This, as I have before ob&s;erved, from Mr. Hooker and others, is a covenant, and all covenants as I have before &s;aid, mu&s;t be ratified before witne&s;&s;es, and by proper authority, which the con&s;titution, law, or cu&s;tom has a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e. E&s;pecially all covenants of any great importance mu&s;t be ratified and &s;olemnized with all tho&s;e formalities. So the Platform, Chap. i. Sec. 4. &s;peaking of Church affairs, &s;ays, "In re&s;pect of the manner according to <HI>civil and Church cu&s;tom.</HI>" And Chap. ix, Sec. 2. "Ordination is the &s;olemn puting a man into his office in the Church, being like in&s;talling a magi&s;trate in the Com|monwealth." Mr. Hooker &s;peaks the &s;ame, Preface, page 16.</P>
<P>Here then, according to the Platform and Mr. Hooker; Ordination is the &s;olemn in&s;talling the man in his office. And as it is fixing him in office relation
<PB N="18" REF="026757_0017_0FD1C24B5B5C1EB0">
to a congregation or flock, it is &s;olemnizing the cov|enant between him and his people by proper au|thority.</P>
<P>This leads to enquire what is proper authority, for &s;olemnizing this covenant, according to congregational principles and Church cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The Platform con&s;iders the power of ordination of their Pa&s;tor to be in the Church; but with this provi|&s;o, that the Elders of other Churches may do it, if the Church where the officer is to be ordained de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment in the Platform is ob&s;cure, and &s;eems to favour lay ordination, and is that on which &s;ome wild, haughty, arrogant, &s;upercilious, &s;eparately, inde|pendent people, have pretended to ju&s;tify lay ordina|tion. But though there might be &s;ome degree of mi&s;|take in the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country as to this mat|ter; yet they are in my opinion, very excu&s;able, &s;eeing they had been &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed, harra&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted with prelatical impo&s;itions and depo&s;itions of Pa&s;tors; it would be &s;trange, if not a miracle, if mere men, however wi&s;e and pious, &s;hould not vibrate in &s;ome degree into the oppo&s;ite extreme; yet Dr. Stiles, who has &s;pared no labour and attention to inve&s;tigate the principles and cu&s;toms of the&s;e Churches ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement in this land, &s;ays, "that he has nev|er found with certainty, more than one in&s;tance of lay ordination of a per&s;on never before ordained, the la&s;t century; and this was done by advice, and under the in&s;pection, of Mini&s;ters ordained by Bi&s;hops in Eng|land, one of whom prayed at the &s;olemnity of con&s;e|cration, and all gave their approbation and right hand of fellow&s;hip, which, in my opinion, &s;ays this eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
<PB N="19" REF="026757_0018_0FD1C24C4EDD7B20">
hi&s;torian, amounts to their performing the or|dination them&s;elves, they being pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the tran&s;action." (Election Sermon, page 60, 62.)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is worthy to be noticed, that although they a &s;hort time entertained a mi&s;|take about lay ordination; yet at the &s;ame time held to, and practi&s;ed fellow|&s;hip and con&s;ociation of Churches in the puting or con&s;tituting in office; &s;o that even their mi&s;take makes no precedent for what &s;elf &s;ufficient, &s;chi&s;matical Inde|pendents pretend to make from it, viz. of a right and power to ordain and depo&s;e of them&s;elves alone.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Doctor further ob&s;erves, the time was very &s;hort in which this idea prevailed, and providentially brought no mi&s;chief, as the body of the Pa&s;tors had been ordained by Bi&s;hops in England. And &s;ays, that the ordination of our Clergy is regular and &s;criptural and <HI>may be traced in the line of Pre&s;byters up to the Apo&s;|tolic age.</HI></P>
<P>Through this mi&s;take, which tho&s;e pious <HI>Patriarchs</HI> of this country were, as I have ob&s;erved, drove into; we may candidly and ju&s;tly attribute that ob&s;curity in the Platform about <HI>ordination</HI> or <HI>in&s;tallation.</HI> Yet by oth|er writings &s;oon after, and the cu&s;tom which uni|formly prevailed among Congregational Churches profe&s;&s;edly on the Platform, it appears that the mean|ning of the Platform is; that the power of ordination or in&s;tallation is in every Congregational Church in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as that no Bi&s;hop, Prelate or Pre&s;bytery have any right to impo&s;e a Mini&s;ter upon them: but that their Mini&s;ter or Elder, &s;hall be ordained or in|&s;talled by coordinate Elders or Pre&s;byters in Coun|cil of Churches of their own choice, jointly with their Pa&s;tor elect, who is a party in the &s;olemnity. So that here is another <HI>covenant;</HI> for upon Congregational principles every Church tran&s;action is, according to covenant or confederation, a voluntary covenant tran&s;|action;
<PB N="20" REF="026757_0019_0FD1C24DC72E3608">
in oppo&s;ition to being forced by &s;uperiour power: &s;ee Mr. Davenport, page 29, and onward. Thus, in ordination or in&s;tallation of a Pa&s;tor, the Church &s;ends out, with con&s;ent of the Pa&s;tor elect, to &s;uch Churches as they plea&s;e, inviting them with their Pa&s;tor and delegates to come and join in Council to ordain or in&s;tall their Pa&s;tor elect. They come, look into their &s;tate and order; their covenant with their Pa&s;tor elect, and his qualifications for the office; and conclude to proceed, or not, as they find circum|&s;tances. If they find all things proper, they proceed; and in the mo&s;t public and &s;olemn manner, ordain and &s;olemnize the covenant between Pa&s;tor and People. And there covenant with both Pa&s;tor and people, in that relation to each other, by the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.</P>
<P>Here is the mo&s;t public, &s;olemn, religious cove|nant and combination of fellow&s;hip, union and reci|procity, con&s;ociating for mutual help, one to an|other.</P>
<P>Here is covenant upon covenant, one covenant &s;o|lemnizing and ratifying another; the &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;acred combination, profe&s;&s;edly &s;o|lemnized, even as an oath before God, Angels and Men, as witne&s;&s;es to the confederation.</P>
<P>That what I have &s;aid, is the true intent and mean|ing of the Platform, though but ob&s;curely hinted there|in, is evident; &s;ince the Synod in 1662, about 14 years after, in which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be mo&s;t of the &s;ame members, who compo&s;ed the Platform; in their re&s;ult a&s;&s;ert the communion, fellow&s;hip and con&s;ociation of
<PB N="21" REF="026757_0020_0FD1C24F428B8510">
Churches; and that the ordination, tran&s;lation and depo&s;ition of Elders are important things to be per|formed by the con&s;ociation of Churches.</P>
<P>And this is of the more authority not only, as there were the &s;ame men to explain their meaning in the Platform: but it &s;hews the &s;en&s;e of both Church and State at that time; as this Synod was convened by the order of the General Court to an&s;wer certain que&s;|tions, one of which was, <HI>"Whether, according to the word of God, there ought to be a con&s;ociation of Churches; and what &s;hould be the manner of it."</HI></P>
<P>They an&s;wer that there ought to be a con&s;ociation of Churches; and propo&s;e about the &s;ame which is now partly practi&s;ed in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> viz. tho&s;e who live in a convenient vicinity to con&s;ociate; though with liberty re&s;erved, without offence, to make u&s;e of others. They a&s;&s;ert, that "there hath con&s;tantly been in the&s;e Churches a profe&s;&s;ion of communion, in giv|ing the right hand of fellow&s;hip at the gathering of a Church and ordination of Elders, which importeth a con&s;ociation, and obligeth to the practice of it." Here is the highe&s;t evidence of there being a <HI>con&s;tant</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;ion of communion in the&s;e Churches from the <HI>be|ginning</HI> in giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip at the gathering of Churches and ordination of Elders; for this was but about 41 years after the fir&s;t arrival at Plymouth, and there cannot be a doubt but that there were many men in this Synod who had been eye wit|ne&s;&s;es all that time of the things they a&s;&s;erted: there is al&s;o the witne&s;s of the General Court of the &s;ame thing in their approbation and acceptance of that re|&s;ult; which two bodies of men, &s;o venerable, honour|able
<PB N="22" REF="026757_0021_0FD1C2589D1ACE40">
and re&s;pectable, is &s;uch &s;uperlative evidence of the order and fellow&s;hip of Congregational Churches in this country from the beginning, as ought to &s;i|lence and &s;hame all tho&s;e &s;chi&s;matics who arrogantly and in&s;olently pretend to patronize their di&s;orderly In|dependent &s;entiments and conduct by the Platform.</P>
<P>Dr. Increa&s;e Mather, who was on the &s;tage when that re&s;ult was made, in his Te&s;timony, in 1720, a&s;|&s;erts, that agreeable to that re&s;ult, there was a law of the Colony which required the approbation of three or four Churches to every ordination: &s;o that we have it from the highe&s;t authority or evidence, that the &s;en&s;e and practice of the&s;e Churches from the begin|ning was, that ordination, tran&s;lation, and depo&s;ition of Elders &s;hould be by communion, fellow&s;hip, or con|&s;ociation of Churches. And it al&s;o appears that both Church and State &s;oon after the Platform was made, were &s;o far from that <HI>independent,</HI> &s;chi&s;matical, de&s;po|tic &s;entiment, which &s;ome of late a vow, that every in|dividual congregation hath <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> alone to call and put into office and di&s;mi&s;s from, and put out of office; that they made both a re&s;ult of Synod and law of the State again&s;t it. But though they &s;uppo&s;ed the forming into particular con&s;ociations proper; yet, con|&s;idering the whole body of Congregational Churches one general con&s;ociation, out of which they might choo&s;e and employ &s;uch as occa&s;ion called; this practice has uniformly prevailed, by which it is become a Church <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> and, according to the Platform, is as binding as any thing can be. Hence the forming into partic|ular local con&s;ociations has never prevailed in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts or Newhamp&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="026757_0022_0FD1C25A90F51850">You may perhaps conclude that I have brought in witne&s;&s;es enough already again&s;t tho&s;e &s;chi&s;matical, in|&s;olent Independents, who do not blu&s;h to challenge the pious founders of Congregationali&s;m to be for them. Doubtle&s;s when &s;uch an augu&s;t body of wit|ne&s;&s;es, that venerable Synod of Divines, and that hon|ourable a&s;&s;embly of Politicians are brought in again&s;t tho&s;e in&s;olent u&s;urpers, it is de&s;ervedly enough to con|demn them to perpetual bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>But witne&s;&s;es throng in before me, as if eager to ca&s;t in their weight again&s;t tho&s;e defamers of the cha|racters and principles of tho&s;e pious fathers and found|ers of Congregationali&s;m.</P>
<P>Dr. Cotton Mather, in his <HI>Ratio Di&s;ciplinae,</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that the manner and cu&s;tom of &s;olemnizing the ordi|nation of a Pa&s;tor is by inviting in a Council of oth|er Churches and proceeding as above de&s;cribed. And this account which he gives, you will allow to be in|conte&s;tibly true, &s;ince there is an atte&s;tation, to the truth of his account of the di&s;cipline of New-England Churches, by his father, Dr. Increa&s;e Mather; who according as he a&s;&s;erts his age, at the time of &s;igning his atte&s;tation, was ten years old when the Platform was made, and had been above &s;eventy years an eye witne&s;s of the practice of the Churches upon it from the beginning. And it is well known that he was a man of unque&s;tionable probity, great learning, u|niver&s;al knowledge, uncommon ob&s;ervation and accuracy. And he, in the &s;ame atte&s;tation, a&s;&s;erts in behalf of New-England Churches, that they di&s;liked and di&s;claimed the name <HI>Independent:</HI> And that the rea&s;on that name was impo&s;ed upon them was, becau&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="026757_0023_0FD1C25C16EEC5F8">
they di&s;owned a dependence on &s;uperiour eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal power on earth, from which to derive their forms and officers: But &s;ays, they revere Synods and Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Councils. He al&s;o in the &s;ame atte&s;tation &s;peaks of Mr. Hooker's <HI>Survey of Church Di&s;cipline;</HI> as being e&s;teemed a mo&s;t accurate logical compo&s;ure; as unan&s;werable; had the approbation of all the Min|i&s;ters that were then in that, and the next colony, (i. e.) Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay colonies. The &s;ame Mr. Hooker &s;ays, the Dr. "has leave to profe&s;s, that all or nearly all the Elders of tho&s;e colonies ap|proved of what he had written, under their hands, and, by their de&s;ire in a common meeting, of his publi&s;hing it." From which writers, we have ample evidence, what the general &s;en&s;e and practice of the Mini&s;ters and Churches were, before and at the time of making the Platform; and &s;ince for &s;eventy years, which brings it to the time of many per&s;ons now living.</P>
<P>Another witne&s;s again&s;t Independents, that the ordi|nation of a Pa&s;tor is a covenant, and a&s;&s;erting the con|&s;ociation of Churches, is Dr. Samuel Mather, who in his Apology, &s;ays, <HI>"That our platform of Church di&s;cipline is deemed a Covenant."</HI> And for the proof of this, he ob&s;erves, that the platform was compo&s;ed by the&s;e churches in a body repre&s;entative. And further to e&s;tabli&s;h this idea, he notices the unanimous vote of the Synod in 1679, approving of the Platform for the &s;ub&s;tance of it, de&s;iring that the Churches might con|tinue &s;tedfa&s;t in the order of the Go&s;pel according to what is therein held forth, from the word of God.' The Dr. here ob&s;erves, that the original compilers of the Platform, as well as this Synod; re&s;erved an entire
<PB N="25" REF="026757_0024_0FD1C25DB460D810">
and perpetual liberty in their covenant and combina|tion, to &s;earch the Scriptures and go according to them; that, doing thus, they were &s;till within this Con&s;ocia|ting Covenant, and fully kept it. He further argues, "that it is to be deemed a covenant from the Synods and Councils which have met by virtue of it; main|taining a con&s;tant fellow&s;hip, in many federal overt acts; and &s;o have tran&s;mitted this covenant they made to &s;ucceeding generations, in gathering new churches, and ordaining Pa&s;tors from time to time; the&s;e churches, he &s;ays, have &s;o often renewed their original pact or cov|enant.</P>
<P>You will readily &s;ee from what has been offered from the writings and practice of Congregationali&s;ts, why they &s;o much di&s;liked <HI>Independents.</HI> All men of principle mu&s;t dete&s;t them, they are properly a pe&s;t to &s;ociety, while they hold them&s;elves at a loo&s;e from check or control; but Congregationali&s;m is all by covenants, holding them&s;elves under the &s;tronge&s;t ties, the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations: the whole &s;cheme of church order and di&s;cipline, is by covenants, by which the parties confederate together in the mo&s;t &s;olemn mutual engagement; in which are many covenants blended together, viz. The Church Covenant, form|ing or connecting an individual Church; which is blended with the Con&s;ociating Covenant that combines the Churches together; and here is the Pa&s;tor's Cove|nant with his people, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and parochial, blended with the Church and Con&s;ociating Covenant by the manner of ordaining or in&s;talling him in office by the Fellow&s;hip of Churches. All which if it were only merely lawful thus to unite, without its being any
<PB N="26" REF="026757_0025_0FD1C25F02351428">
duty thus to combine, would be of the nature of a <HI>vow;</HI> and could not be violated in any branch thereof with|out being highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God. Eccle. v. 4. <HI>When thou vowe&s;t a vow vnto God defer not to pay it; for he hath no plea&s;ure in fools.</HI> Hence for any people after they have cho&s;en and in&s;talled a mini&s;ter; if they after|wards conceive a notion that he is weak or not &s;o po|lite or popular a &s;peaker as they wi&s;h for, or whatever; if it be not a real crime that he is guilty of; for the people to rai&s;e a cry again&s;t him to turn him away; is at lea&s;t, <HI>after vows to make enquiry,</HI> as in Prov. xx. 25, or, <HI>Saying before the Angel it was an error,</HI> Eccle. v. 4, that they have made a fooli&s;h choice and covenant. This neither the law of God or man admits of, that men &s;hould avail them&s;elves of their own blunders, or to <HI>&s;tuliify</HI> them&s;elves; for God has &s;aid, in this very ca&s;e, he <HI>hath no plea&s;ure in fools,</HI> but is angry with them <HI>to de&s;troy the work of their hands.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;criptures are very full and frequent in &s;peak|ing again&s;t the violating of covenants; covenant break|ers are repeatedly reckoned in &s;cripture, in the black|e&s;t catalogue of criminals, and God often threatened and puni&s;hed covenant breakers in the &s;evere&s;t manner. Thus the <HI>covenant</HI> which <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the princes of I&s;|rael made with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> though it was obtained by collu&s;ion, and they were not the people they pre|tended they were, yet, God would not &s;uffer that cove|nant to be broken with impunity. You recollect how God afflicted the whole nation of I&s;rael for <HI>Saul's</HI> vi|olating this Covenant with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> many gener|ations after it was made; and how <HI>Saul's</HI> po&s;terity of the third generation had to &s;uffer even a violent igno|minious
<PB N="27" REF="026757_0026_0FD1C2675208D628">
death for his breaking this Covenant; this &s;hews how greatly God abhors Covenant breakers; and will not forget their perfidy; they entail cur&s;es on their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This affair of the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and God's dealings re|&s;pecting it, &s;hews the ab&s;urdity of their notion, who pretend that ance&s;tors have no right to make cove|nants binding on their po&s;terity, that parents cannot make covenants to affect or bind their children, that rulers cannot make covenants to affect or bind their peo|ple: And, in a word, argue that no one can be obligated only by his own per&s;onal act: Such very highly and dar|ingly impeach the divine conduct in the affair of the <HI>Gibe|onites.</HI></P>
<P>For there was a covenant made by <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the princes of the congregation, with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> which God held &s;acred above four hundred years after, and puni&s;hed all I&s;rael with famine three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for <HI>Saul's</HI> breaking this Covenant. And finally <HI>Saul's</HI> children and grandchildren many of them mu&s;t die for it, and then God was entreated for the land.</P>
<P>Covenant breakers of all kinds; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who break this &s;acred complex Covenant of which I am treating, in any branch of it, either with individuals in the &s;ame Church, by &s;eparating, or other|wi&s;e; or with their Mini&s;ter, by for&s;aking of him, or by violently turning him away; or with other Church|es, by breaking fellow&s;hip with them; they would do well to con&s;ider what an accumulated &s;cene of wrath and cur&s;es from the Almighty they are trea&s;uring up for them&s;elves and po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of God's threatening and puni&s;hing cov|enant breakers are numerous. You remember how
<PB N="28" REF="026757_0027_0FD1C26AC19B6080">
God threatened and puni&s;hed <HI>Sennacharib</HI> for his per|fidy in breaking Covenant with <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> The Angel of the Lord de&s;troyed an hundred and eighty five thou&s;and of his army in one night, and wholly broke it up: he went home and there was treacherou&s;ly and paricidiou&s;ly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated when at his devotion.</P>
<P><HI>Zedekiah</HI> is another in&s;tance of God's threatening and puni&s;hing perfidy; when he had &s;worn fealty to the King of Babylon, &s;ent to Egypt for help again&s;t the king he had &s;worn to. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, &s;urely in the place where the King dwelleth, who made him King, who&s;e oath he de&s;pi&s;ed, and who&s;e Cove|nant he broke, even with him in the mid&s;t of Babylon he &s;hall die.</HI> Ezek. xvii. 16.</P>
<P>I need not multiply in&s;tances; you well remember, that God &s;ays, <HI>Though it be but a man's Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man di&s;annulleth, or addeth there|to.</HI></P>
<P>But when it is con&s;idered that the&s;e Covenants of which I am treating are not merely man's Covenants, but are God's Covenants, what he has in&s;tituted for us to ob&s;erve; and that his dealings with man are feder|al; even in innocency it was a Covenant; and the &s;cheme of re&s;toration by <HI>grace,</HI> is a Covenant with Chri&s;t, and through him with all believers, has given him for a Covenant of the people; and has &s;et us &s;o|cial ordinances to perform, commanding us to do them. And when Chri&s;t, who is the Covenant of the people, in his la&s;t prayer, prayed for their unity, and, by his Apo&s;tle, a&s;&s;erted, that his Church is one, as the natural body, all the members caring one for another.

man's Covenant; and not only a per&s;onal covenanting one with another; but a Covenant with God, com|manded by him, and is the &s;tronge&s;t obligation upon every one of the members, bound by &s;o many &s;acred Covenants, that whoever pre&s;umes to violate this com|plicated confederation, they make &s;uch a wound, frac|ture or di&s;location in the body of Chri&s;t, as they can never an&s;wer before him, who has declared, that, <HI>Who &s;o &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a mill&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the &s;ea.</HI></P>

<P>By this view of the matter may be &s;een, in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, why Mr. Hooker, the Platform, and other venerable writers, were &s;o decidedly again&s;t &s;ep|arations from the Church, and other &s;chi&s;matical con|duct; even though there are &s;ome things ami&s;s which ought to be healed.

<P>If tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;ed human temporal Covenants were &s;ubjected to &s;uch a heavy doom, as Saul, Sennacherib and Zedekiah were; of how much &s;orer puni&s;hments &s;hall they be thought worthy who tread under foot &s;o many &s;acred Covenants with God, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and one another.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A CHURCH formed and organized as I have &s;aid, is fitted to execute all tho&s;e laws and ordinances they confederate for.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e things which are merely official, &s;uch as di&s;|pen&s;ing the word and ordinances, leading and ruling the Church; are peculiarly and &s;olely the province of the Pa&s;tor, therefore do not &s;trictly come under the pre|&s;ent enquiry about the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of the Church. But there is a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of a Church thus or|ganized to exerci&s;e DISCIPLINE; they all covenant to watch over each other, not for their halting, but for their good; that if any one falls, the other may help him up; if any one goes a&s;tray, i. e. does any thing contrary to any divine rule; to u&s;e &s;uch means as Chri&s;t has in&s;tituted to recover him. Hence, the Platform repeatedly a&s;&s;erts, that it is to be done to ED|IFICATION. In the 1&s;t, Chap. Sec. 4th, &s;ays, with re&s;pect to the <HI>end,</HI> mu&s;t be done to <HI>edification.</HI> Again in the &s;ame Sec. "Mu&s;t be done in &s;uch a manner as is mo&s;t expedient for edification; &s;o that the end in view, or object to be obtained in Church di&s;cipline, and the manner of obtaining it, mu&s;t be for <HI>edification.</HI> Or, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>by love to &s;erve one another.</HI> And the Platform in Chap. xiv. repeatedly a&s;&s;erts, that the object of Church di&s;cipline is, to recover and gain a lap&s;ed member.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="026757_0030_0FD1C26F15684538">In this every member has a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power;</HI> and, it may be added, is under obligation, by the laws of God, and by his own Covenant, to tell his <HI>brother his fault,</HI> privately; and endeavour to recover him; and if he hear thee thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. If he will not, then to take one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But, if he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church, Mat. xviii. This is plain, &s;imple, and ea&s;y to be un|der&s;tood; and is directed to by the Platform, Chap. x. Sec. v. yet has of latter years &s;eldom been prac|ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>Many ab&s;urd notions, and wicked practices have been advanced to evade, and avoid this plain &s;imple law of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;ole King and Law-giver of his Church. Some have in earne&s;t pretend|ed that this law of Chri&s;t re&s;pected only private per|&s;onal offences, known only to the offender, and one individual offended. But it is plain this cannot be any thing intended; for no WORD is to be advanced to the Church, but what may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the want of witne&s;&s;es they will obliquely charge the Per&s;on with &s;omething, and demand of him whether it is not &s;o? We under&s;tand you did, or &s;aid&mdash; You know whether you &s;aid &s;o! Or, you mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible that you * * * *. You ought to own the truth: DID NOT YOU SAY SO? If he will not deny it, he is to be deemed guilty; or, however, if he declines own|ing or denying of it; he is condemned as criminally ob&s;tinate. All &s;uch kind of procedures, you will join

with me in &s;aying, are horridly wicked practices; have for their precedent the <HI>Papal Inqui&s;ition;</HI> and that it is a real virtue in any one not to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions; becau&s;e it is following the example of Chri&s;t, when he in like manner, was accu&s;ed and interrogated; and it ought to be remembered that, that great example of the world, and e&s;pecially of all chri&s;tians, never did give a direct an&s;wer to any captious que&s;tion, in all we have recorded of him. And the conduct of Chri&s;t when he was under trial &s;hew that he infinitely abhors &s;uch a practice; that therefore he was infinitely far from intending any &s;uch thing, in his Law in Matth. 13th. And as all &s;uch or &s;imilar practices are not only con|trary to the Laws of Chri&s;t, but are contrary to human rights, as have long been adopted and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Engli&s;h nation, and particularly and expre&s;sly by the American States; <HI>that no man &s;hall be compelled to accu&s;e or excu&s;e him&s;elf, or produce witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him&s;elf.</HI> Therefore &s;uch practi&s;e is an in&s;ult upon, if not trea&s;on again&s;t the con&s;titution and laws of both God and man.</P>
<P>Another wicked practice to avoid this divine law of the Supreme Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth, is, the col|lecting in companies either with or without the per|&s;on who is the object of their enquiry, to confer with him, or with one onother, to be agreed how to pro|ceed with a brother, or Pa&s;tor: if it is the Pa&s;tor; a very proper preparatory for &s;uch meeting is, to collect in companies on Sabbath-noons, and &s;ome of the lead|ing Church members find fault with his preaching, and one tells one thing, another another thing, and many of the things &s;o long ago that if they are true, mu&s;t un|doubtedly be in a great mea&s;ure, if not wholly forgot.

Or however or whatever the particulars are, they are <HI>talking again&s;t him by the walls, and in the doors of the hou&s;e,</HI> as the people did again&s;t Ezekiel;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an <HI>ungodly digging up evil with burning fire in their lips. Like the de|vi&s;ing devices as again&s;t</HI> Jeremiah, &s;miting with the tongue, defaming on every &s;ide; report &s;ay they, and we will report it. Prov. xvi. 27. and Jer. xviii. 18. and xx. 10.</NOTE> and in pro|per time they are prepared to have a more gene|ral collection or meeting, and require the object of their inqui&s;itions to be with them. Such kind of meetings whatever they may call them, are unlawful a&s;&s;emblies, they are riots both as to Church and State, being expre&s;sly repugnant to the con&s;titution, laws and rules of both. Mr. Hooker &s;ays, <HI>"Such a company wants precept or example."</HI> He means examples to ju&s;|tify it. For as to examples of people meeting to|gether in an unlawful, riotous manner, there are a multitude of them recorded in Scripture. Thus the people gathered together again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron, again&s;t David, and many of the Prophets; thus a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t, Stephen and many of the Apo&s;tles: The collection again&s;t the Apo&s;tle Paul, at Ephe&s;us, was an eminent pattern for all &s;uch kind of meetings.</P>
<P>But for any Church of Chri&s;t, or company of peo|ple, to pretend to meet as a Church of Chri&s;t, to en|quire into matters of complaint again&s;t any of its members; without matters properly &s;tated, and the accu&s;ed's being privately and previou&s;ly informed of what they have again&s;t him, according to the law, in the xviii th of Matth. and to pretend to proceed to act upon matters of complaint thus; is a high, and (when objected to by any of its members) is an audacious profanation of the name, and in&s;ult of the maje&s;ty of
<PB N="34" REF="026757_0033_0FD1C27B92FDD8D0">
the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And it is no le&s;s an in&s;ult of the con&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, which expre&s;sly pro|vides that <HI>"No &s;ubject &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for any crime or offence, until the &s;ame is fully and plainly, &s;ub|&s;tantially and formally, de&s;cribed to him." Declaration of Rights,</HI> Art. xii. Hence if any Church Member in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts be arraigned before a Church, to an&s;wer to any matters not introduced according to the 18th of Matth. and &s;aid Declaration of Rights, he has full <HI>right,</HI> according to the Platform, to deny their juri&s;|diction, and avoid their action: for that a&s;&s;erts, that as to the <HI>manner</HI> of Church proceedings, it mu&s;t be ac|cording to Civil and Church <HI>cu&s;tom.</HI> The Bible, the Platform, the Con&s;titution therefore, are all again&s;t them; and if they pretend to proceed in that manner it is no better than riotous conduct, and void by all the rules and order of proceedings in both Church and State.</P>
<P>Mr. Hooker in his Survey, &s;peaking of Church procedings in di&s;cipline, &s;ays, "Common human infir|mities mu&s;t not be made crimes of. If the matter be doubtful, and yet &s;o much ground that we think we cannot be clear without rebuking him; &s;earch into the matter; for it is a &s;afe rule when there is not ground of conviction, not to cen&s;ure. If there is ground of conviction, then proceed according to the rule in the 18th of Matthew. He &s;ays, if the&s;e things were well attended; tho&s;e mi&s;takes, cla&s;hings, &s;ayings, gain&s;ay|ings, and the many offences committed among breth|ren, while they come to reform an offence given, would ea&s;ily be prevented through the help and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Chri&s;t; if the party that comes to rebuke would be &s;ure,</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="026757_0034_0FD1C27D0783D7E8"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the &s;in was committed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That he hath evidence, that &s;uch a broth|er committed it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> That &s;uch a <HI>rule</HI> is fair and full to con|vince of &s;uch a &s;in.</P>
<P>The Maje&s;ty of Chri&s;t's Ordinance would appear with much evidence; and with much ea&s;e and com|fort on all hands; in all the degrees of it; in private, before <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> or before the Church."</P>
<P>He further &s;ays, "The preparation of the action lies in two things.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e mu&s;t be examined pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Examination recorded exactly.</P>
<P>HE THAT COMPLAINS MUST KNOW TWO RULES.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He mu&s;t not dare complain, <HI>unle&s;s he can plainly and peremptorily lay in his accu&s;ation of another, touching &s;uch &s;peeches and carriages.</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>peremptori|ly accu&s;e.</HI> Becau&s;e I would prevent &s;uch weak and windy kind of expre&s;&s;ions, as too often we meet with. <HI>I take it &s;o: I conceive it &s;o: It was &s;o reported: I met with it in that manner.</HI>"</P>
<P>If Mr. Hooker was again&s;t &s;uch weak and windy accu&s;ations or witne&s;&s;ing; mo&s;t certainly he would be again&s;t &s;uch a wicked and abu&s;ive accu&s;ation or witne&s;&s;ing as the following: <HI>There is a gener|al unea&s;ine&s;s: It is in every body's mouth: We really believe he is a bad man: He mu&s;t be ca&s;t out: Away with him.</HI> By &s;uch kind of witne&s;&s;ing or rather clam|ours, the virtuous <HI>Naboth,</HI> and the Holy <HI>Je&s;us</HI> lo&s;t their lives. Of Naboth they &s;aid, <HI>He bla&s;phemed God and the King,</HI> but told no fact or words of bla&s;phe|my: For they knew he had u&s;ed none.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="026757_0035_0FD1C27ECD512A18">So as to Chri&s;t: <HI>Away with him: Crucify him.</HI> Pi|late &s;aid, what evil hath he done? They would not ri&s;que the i&s;&s;ue upon FACTS: but &s;ay, <HI>If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>All &s;uch kind of accu&s;ations, witne&s;&s;ing, or clam|ours, where <HI>facts</HI> are not clearly &s;tated and proved, are fal&s;e and wicked; and will mo&s;t certainly be rejected and dete&s;ted by all rational judicious people.</P>
<P>We will hear further from Mr. Hooker, he &s;ays, "<HI>Secondly,</HI> as his (i. e. the complainer's) accu&s;ation mu&s;t be plain; <HI>&s;o his proofs mu&s;t be direct and preg|nant;</HI> that &s;uch words for the &s;ub&s;tance and reality of them were &s;poken, and &s;uch things done. There mu&s;t be <HI>two witne&s;&s;es to e&s;tabli&s;h every word.</HI></P>
<P>ON THE ELDERS' PART TWO RULES, if attended to, make great riddance of occa&s;ions, and prevent di&s;|tempers.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, let the accu&s;ation be pre&s;ently and exactly record|ed;</HI> together with the an&s;wer thereto, in like manner; for experience teacheth, that in a multiplicity of de|bates, parties are apt to forget, or el&s;e not willing to remember; and &s;ome ready to mi&s;take, add, alter, va|ry in expre&s;&s;ion as they &s;ee there may be an advan|tage come to their own, or di&s;advantage to the con|trary cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Let the Elders confine all parties to the point in hand,</HI> and not &s;uffer them by extravagancies to darken the truth."</P>
<P>Speaking of Church cen&s;ures, he &s;ays "It mu&s;t not be for &s;mall petty aberrations; but &s;uch as are abomina|ble; carry the face of evil in their forehead, upon the fir&s;t well grounded con&s;ideration of rea&s;on; pertina|ciou&s;ly and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="026757_0036_0FD1C2801F0836C0">From what has been extracted from Mr. Hooker, it appears, that the only proper &s;ea&s;on of complain|ing, of an offending member, is immediately. Mr. Hooker &s;ays, <HI>pre&s;ently.</HI> This in every view is nece&s;|&s;ary; not only that it be done, while things are fre&s;h in the mind, &s;o as that truth may be inve&s;tigated; but to &s;uffer &s;in long on a fellow member, they make them&s;elves tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and to rake up old things, or pretend matters of long &s;tanding, when things mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure be forgot; mu&s;t have all the appear|ance of fal&s;ehood and ought to be treated as &s;lander.</P>
<P>The Civil law provides that actions of tre&s;pa&s;s &s;hall be outlawed in a &s;hort term of years; with proper &s;avings, where inevitable nece&s;&s;ity prevents bringing the action within the general limitation. And the Platform &s;ays, that Church matters &s;hould be conduct|ed according to <HI>civil cu&s;tom.</HI> And Chri&s;t has limited actions of tra&s;pa&s;s in his Kingdom even &s;horter than any civil State, Luke xvii. 3, 4. <HI>Take heed to your|&s;elves; if thy brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee rebuke him; and if he repent forgive him. And if he tra&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee &s;even times in a day; and &s;even times in a day turn again unto thee &s;aying, I repent; thou &s;halt forgive him.</HI> All this proves in the mo&s;t decided manner that Chri&s;t's Law is, that the accu&s;ation &s;hall be made im|mediately. <HI>Take heed to your&s;elves; if thy brother tre&s;|pa&s;s, thou &s;hall rebuke him.</HI> As much as to &s;ay, if you neglect rebuking of him you make his &s;in your own. Therefore <HI>take heed to your&s;elves,</HI> that you do not make his &s;in your own: his &s;peaking in the next ver&s;e of &s;e|ven times in a day, proves that he means it &s;hould be done immediately; el&s;e, there could not be &s;o many times in a day. He does not &s;et any particular length

of time; the ca&s;e may be &s;uch that it cannot be done in&s;tantly after the fault is committed; the per&s;on may not be in a proper temper of mind to admit a rebuke; or &s;ome other circum&s;tances. But, it is a plain law that it &s;hall be done as &s;oon as circum&s;tances and the nature of things will admit of it; or it is outlawed in his Kingdom; the per&s;on has fixed the &s;in on him&s;elf, and if he brings an accu&s;ation again&s;t his brother af|ter that, it is &s;lander. All this perfectly agrees with Mr. Hooker, where he &s;ays, "It mu&s;t be done PRE|SENTLY."</P>
<P>You will al&s;o readily &s;ee by what I have entertained you with, from that great divine and politician Mr. Hooker; the &s;ame which I have &s;aid before: That the only proper or legal way of introducing accu&s;ations into the Church and conducting them therein, is ac|cording to the xviiith of Matthew. Fir&s;t privately tell the offender, or &s;uppo&s;ed offender, his <HI>fault:</HI> This can be no other than, to point out to him the <HI>fact</HI> he has done, and the divine <HI>law</HI> or <HI>rule</HI> he has thereby violated. And this Mr. Hooker has proved, by un|an&s;werable rea&s;ons, &s;hould be done in writing. This mu&s;t be attended to in the next trial before one or two; al&s;o before the Church; and this is the mo&s;t peaceable and likely way to recover a lap&s;ed mem|ber; and to maintain order and peace in the whole Church.</P>
<P>In this way, the per&s;on is privately and previou&s;ly certified what he has to an&s;wer to, as I before &s;hewed, that the Bible, Platform and Con&s;titution; or rights of mankind require.</P>
<P>Although different <HI>faults</HI> require different Church animadver&s;ions; as here&s;y is to have a fir&s;t and &s;econd
<PB N="39" REF="026757_0038_0FD1C289C2E4E3F8">
admonition before rejection: But moral &s;candal re|quires immediate rejection; yet there is but one way to introduce all matters of offence for trial into the Church, viz. as above &s;tated from the Bible and the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>And if any Church pretends or pre&s;umes to act up|on a ca&s;e, any other way introduced; and e&s;pecially when that is claimed by the party accu&s;ed; they act out of character, and it invalidates all their procedings therein; and though they may have <HI>power</HI> to pa&s;s votes and condemn a member; yet they have no <HI>right</HI> to do &s;o any more than a civil Court have <HI>right</HI> to arre&s;t a man contrary to the Con&s;titution and law; which if any Judges of court &s;hould pre&s;ume to do, their being judges would not legitimate their conduct; any more than if any other men &s;hould &s;et up a mock court and trial and condemn a man: but it would be much wor&s;e for judges to do thus, as they thereby vi|olate their tru&s;t, and in&s;ult that authority which had thus dignified them. And it is &s;till as much more hei|nous for a Church of Chri&s;t to pre&s;ume to go on &s;o, in a pretended trial contrary to his law; as it is pro|faning Divine Authority, and violating their own mo&s;t &s;olemn vows and engagements.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A CONGREGATIONAL Church, organized as I have &s;aid, and regularly a&s;&s;embled with a cau&s;e before them, introduced according to Chri&s;t's law, un|der
<PB N="40" REF="026757_0039_0FD1C289C69FA5F0">
the pre&s;idency of their pa&s;tor, have both <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> to proceed decently and orderly to hear, ex|amine, try and finally determine the cau&s;e; if they can do it to the general &s;atisfaction of the whole body. But if there ari&s;es a difference to that degree they cannot acquie&s;ce; they are then according to the ex|ample in the xvth chap. of Acts, to refer it to a Con&s;o|ciation, or Council of Churches, ver&s;e 2d. <HI>When there|fore Paul and Barnabas had no &s;mall di&s;&s;en&s;ion and di&s;|putation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, &s;hould go up to Je|ru&s;alem, unto the Apo&s;tles and Elders about this que&s;tion.</HI> Here was a di&s;&s;en&s;ion among them, and a mutual a|greement to refer it to a Council of Apo&s;tles and El|ders at Jeru&s;alem. It appears that it was a mutual a|greement, becau&s;e both parties had an equal voice in it. Paul and Barnabas were evidently one party, and they went to this Council; and no doubt tho&s;e <HI>certain others</HI> who were &s;ent, were of the other party. Hence therefore, is a Scripture example for a mutual Council, by which is meant mutual in the choice of the parties, or an equal choice in both parties. Not that the mem|bers of the Council &s;hould come together agreed in &s;entiment about the matter in que&s;tion. Such a Coun|cil would not an&s;wer to the pattern, for there was MUCH DISPUTING in that Council, ver&s;e 7th. Here therefore is a divine rule for all Chri&s;tian Churches when there is a divi&s;ion and di&s;&s;en&s;ion among them.</P>
<P>And e&s;pecially Congregational Churches, are under covenant obligation by their Platform, in ca&s;e of divi|&s;ion and di&s;&s;en&s;ion to refer it to a Council, &s;ee Chap. xv. Sec. 2. "If a Church be rent with divi&s;ions a|mong them&s;elves, or lie under any open &s;candal, and
<PB N="41" REF="026757_0040_0FD1C28C1A337948">
yet refu&s;e to con&s;ult with other Churches, for healing or removing of the &s;ame, it is matter of ju&s;t offence, both to the Lord Je&s;us and to other Churches."</P>
<P>Agreeable to what I have now &s;aid; you may find that Mr. Hooker, in his <HI>Survey of Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> Part III. p. 40, &s;ays, "When evils are pre&s;ented to the Church and there is a <HI>mutual and joint concurrence of all;</HI> every particular congregation hath received power from Chri&s;t to proceed to excommunication without any more ado. But in ca&s;e things prove doubtful and the difference grow wide and great, it is then &s;ea&s;onable to crave the help of neighbouring Churches, that they may &s;ee the truth cleared, the erring parties may be convinced, the way al&s;o warranted; <HI>which being done either all will agree; or the major part of the Church hath</HI> POWER <HI>and</HI> RIGHT <HI>to proceed; and the di&s;&s;eating part are bound to &s;it down &s;atisfied therewith.</HI> But in ca&s;e the Council of con&s;ociated Churches &s;hall ad|vi&s;e to withold, <HI>they mu&s;t &s;tay their proceedings.</HI>"</P>
<P>Mr. Hooker here plainly a&s;&s;erts a deci&s;ive power in Councils, &s;o far, that all parties mu&s;t be guided by their re&s;ult. And his &s;entiment herein exactly agrees with the pattern Acts xv. That Council had a right and au|thority to lay a <HI>burden</HI> on the Church, i. e. a&s;&s;ign them &s;omething to ob&s;erve, ver&s;es 28 and 29, and they were under obligation to ob&s;erve and do according to what they directed; for it was an ordinance of Chri&s;t that his Churches &s;hould be thus coun&s;elled and directed by other Churches in Council, and <HI>it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> If, therefore, they neglected or refu&s;ed to ob&s;erve and conform to the re&s;ult, they rebelled again&s;t Chri&s;t, the King and re&s;i&s;ted the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="026757_0041_0FD1C28D884A92E8">But here &s;ome will &s;ay, that Council, in Acts, was di|vinely in&s;pired, and could &s;ay, <HI>it &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> what they wrote. I am willing to allow that they were divinely in&s;pired to &s;et an example, for all Chri&s;tians and Councils, how to inve&s;tigate the truth, and find out the will of God, viz. by di&s;puting, by attending to <HI>facts</HI> and comparing them with the Scriptures. This it is evident that Council did. Fir&s;t there was much di&s;puting, ver&s;e 7. Then Peter, and Paul, and Barnabas gave in their te&s;timony; that the HOLY GHOST and God's miracles attended the uncir|cumci&s;ion, making no difference between them and the circumci&s;ion. Then James &s;ums up the evidence and compares it with the Scriptures, and ob&s;erves that it a|grees with the words of the Prophet. From all which they deduce by fair rea&s;on and argument, that it SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST; and when they had thus argued it out, and proved that it &s;eem|ed good to the Holy Gho&s;t; it &s;eemed good to them too, i. e. according to rea&s;on. So all religious or ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical deci&s;ions ought to be as fairly argued as that Council did, by comparing <HI>facts</HI> with Scripture, &s;o as to appear ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD AND HUMAN REASON.</P>
<P>But though it is not to be expected that a Council of unin&s;pired men, will always proceed &s;o impartially, accurately and judiciou&s;ly, in examining evidence; and comparing of <HI>facts</HI> and Scripture, as that Council in the xvth of Acts did; yet they are doubtle&s;s as likely, and more &s;o, to act impartially, accurately and jud|iciou&s;ly, than the brethren of a Church heated with con|tention and bia&s;ed with prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="026757_0042_0FD1C28F02E8E750">Councils therefore being an ordinance of God, and as likely a way to have di&s;putes and differences &s;ettled properly as the imperfection of human affairs admits of; differing parties in Churches are under obligation by the word of God, and human rea&s;on, to agree and refer their differences to an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council: as the differing parties in Antioch did, to the Council at Jeru&s;alem. Who, when the matter was referred to them, had a right to judge, and direct them what to do; or, as they term it, lay a <HI>burden</HI> upon them, which they were under obligation to ob&s;erve and conform to.</P>
<P>But for a party to go off from the re&s;ult, even if it is the major part; let them call them&s;elves THE ORIG|INAL CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH; or, THE NEW REFORMED CATHOLIC SOCIETY; or whatever; or if it is nearly every member of the Church again&s;t their Pa&s;tor; or even the Pa&s;tor and Church again&s;t a private member; it is di&s;orderly and &s;chi&s;matical, re&s;i&s;ting God's ordinance, in that pattern in Acts, and a violation of their own &s;olemn Covenant and Com|bination, as Dr. Mather terms it, in many overt acts; e&s;pecially in their inviting in &s;uch Council. And &s;uch Church, or part of a Church, are by &s;uch conduct out of fellow&s;hip of all Congregational Churches; and ought to be &s;o treated: As they violate the fellow|&s;hip of Churches, and reject their advice, they ought to be rejected by all to whom they &s;eek for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; until they comply with the advice given them; or otherwi&s;e &s;ettle it to the &s;atisfaction of the parties con|cerned.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN it will &s;erve a turn and per&s;ons wi&s;h to avoid a re&s;ult, or part of it, and regard only what their own humour or caprice dictates, you will hear it confidently a&s;&s;erted, Councils are only ADVISORY; that they are not binding or deci&s;ive; but all <HI>power</HI> is in the Church.</P>
<P>But though we allow the executive power is in the Church; yet they have not <HI>right</HI> to exerci&s;e this pow|er, in ca&s;e of divi&s;ion, or re&s;pecting their Pa&s;tor, unle&s;s it be agreeable to the advice of Council.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="026757_0044_0FD1C296B6FDF508">The Platform in the very beginning of it, fixes as a fundamental maxim of the whole &s;tructure of Church order and di&s;cipline; that, "<HI>In re&s;pect to the manner; decently and in order, according to the nature of the things them&s;elves,</HI> AND CIVIL AND CHURCH CUSTOM."</P>
<P>You will readily grant there is no decency nor order, for Churches to go on and continue in a broil, con|tention and divi&s;ion, without &s;eeking help for a &s;ettle|ment of their divi&s;ions or differences; neither that it can be decent or orderly, when they have invited a Council, to &s;et their re&s;ult at nought, or to mutilate, mangle or di&s;tort a re&s;ult to ju&s;t what they plea&s;e, or to nothing, or to take part and reject the re&s;t of it.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o grant that this is not according to Church CUSTOM, as we have it from Mr. Hooker, the Platform, the Mathers and other venerable writers.</P>
<P>And if we examine the matter by Civil CUSTOM we &s;hall find it will exactly agree with what Mr. Hook|er &s;ays about Councils, that the Church mu&s;t proceed or not, according to the advice of Council. For ac|cording to the wi&s;dom and experience of ages, the Supreme Executive in civil policy, is to do the mo&s;t important executive acts <HI>by and with the advice and con&s;ent of Council.</HI> And it would be invalid, and &s;uch a high handed u&s;urpation as would merit an impeach|ment, and degrading from his office, if he &s;hould pre|tend to do &s;uch things without, or contrary to the ad|vice of Council. Thus it is with the King of Eng|land, thus with the Pre&s;ident of the United States, thus al&s;o with the Governor of the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Do our Churches or &s;ome parties of them claim a more de&s;potic power than the King of England, whom they have long &s;ince dubbed a tyrant.
<PB N="46" REF="026757_0045_0FD1C29A1F036C30">
Do they wi&s;h to be more uncontrolable than Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, who is &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;teemed one of the fir&s;t characters for probity, wi&s;dom, impartiality and in|tegrity? And why &s;hould any of our Churches or parties of them, claim to them&s;elves an exemption from all check or control, &s;o much above the Governor of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts; who cannot appoint and commi&s;&s;ion a common Ju&s;tice of the Peace; nor i&s;&s;ue out a death warrant again&s;t a malefactor, even after he has had a full and fair trial by jury, in a Judicial court, without the ad|vice and con&s;ent of Council? Yet &s;ome of our Churches, or parties of Churches, claim an exclu&s;ive right and prerogative to appoint and inve&s;t officers; and to degrade them at plea&s;ure; and to be accu&s;ers, witne&s;&s;es, judges, and executioners; and have the in|&s;olence to claim all this by the Platform; when that, in the very fir&s;t chapter, places the SCRIPTURES and CIVIL and CHURCH CUSTOM as the foundation of the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of Church proceedings and di&s;cipline; but according to what is already ob&s;erved, the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Church Cu&s;tom</HI> are all a|again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But this <HI>prerogative</HI> which they claim, outvies the claims or preten&s;ions of the de&s;pots of ancient Baby|lon, who had their Coun&s;ellors; and even &s;hames the pu&s;illanimity of the whore of Babylon who reign|eth over the Kings of the earth; who&s;e Executive, the POPE him&s;elf, with all his infallibility and de&s;poti&s;m, does not pre&s;ume or pretend to determine and execute his important Church matters without the <HI>advice</HI> of Council, viz. the CARDINALS in CONCLAVE.</P>
<P>Well might Dr. Mather &s;ay, as in his Apology, &s;peaking of the con&s;ociation of Congregational
<PB N="47" REF="026757_0046_0FD1C29E1FEA5190">
Churches, and of &s;uch as will not con&s;ociate, "they (i. e. Congregationali&s;ts) judge it will not be &s;afe or prudent for any Chri&s;tian to commit his &s;oul to the direction and conduct of &s;uch an independent Church."</P>
<P>Mr. Wi&s;e, al&s;o in his Vindication of the Govern|ment of New England Churches, &s;peaking of regular e&s;tabli&s;hments of civil and Church communities, &s;ays, "for particular &s;ubjects to break in upon them, is to violate the Law of Nature, and is a high u&s;urpation upon the fir&s;t grand immunities of mankind, and &s;ays, &s;uch rebels in States, and u&s;urpers in Churches, <HI>af|front the world.</HI>"</P>
<P>But here is an outcry about con&s;cience; that Coun|cils mu&s;t not have any deci&s;ive power, control or check upon the Church, for &s;ay they, that will be en|croaching upon the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> of the Church!</P>
<P>This appears to be a partial defiled <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> be|cau&s;e it is only on one &s;ide; and does not allow all to have a con&s;cience. For &s;uppo&s;e a Church have a complaint again&s;t a member, and the major part con|demn him; a Council comes, and advi&s;es to take off the cen&s;ure; is the Church's con&s;cience encroached upon? they &s;ay it is. I &s;ay then the con&s;cience of the minor part is encroached upon by the major part; and have as good a right to challenge exemption from conforming to the major part, as the major part have right to challenge exemption from the determination of the Council.</P>
<P>Hence this mu&s;t be a partial <HI>con&s;cience;</HI> monopoliz|ing all con&s;cience to the party which makes the cry.</P>
<P>But here again they will &s;ay, that re&s;ults of Council bind no farther than they are according to the word of God. Upon the &s;ame ground I demand, are individ|uals
<PB N="48" REF="026757_0047_0FD1C29B00E9D748">
in a Church bound any further than the doings of a Church are according to the word of God? And another important que&s;tion ari&s;es, Who is to be judge, whether the doings of a Council, or a Church, are a|greeable to the word of God? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, the party or per&s;on it re&s;pects, and who di&s;like it; or the objection means nothing, has no force in it. So here is a con&s;cience which effectually prevents any i&s;|&s;ue or &s;ettlement of differences, throws all into parties, breaks up &s;ocieties; which I think cannot be a con|&s;cience void of offence, either toward God, or toward man, but mu&s;t be offen&s;ive to both, therefore mu&s;t be an evil con&s;cience.</P>
<P>You may a&s;k what ca&s;es properly require a Coun|cil? I will not be &s;o vain as to pretend I can de&s;cribe all ca&s;es that may ari&s;e, and which properly require a Council. However, you will readily &s;ee by what has been adduced from the Scriptures, the Platform, and other approved authors, that, the &s;ettling and remov|ing of a Pa&s;tor require Councils.</P>
<P>Al&s;o when there is a divi&s;ion in a Church which they cannot reconcile among them&s;elves. This implies that there mu&s;t be proper e&s;&s;ays among them&s;elves for re|conciliation; therefore, that things &s;hould, when the condition and circum&s;tances of the Church will admit, always be heared and tried in the Church before they are brought to a Council. Here, if the parties agree, and &s;end for a mutual Council, there is no difficulty. But if either party refu&s;es, it is a que&s;tion of con&s;id|erable importance, what &s;hall be done? The Plat|form a&s;&s;igns the third way of communion; this would an&s;wer if the Churches would carry it into execution, but through a mode&s;ty in the Churches le&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="026757_0048_0FD1C29F891E6190">
they &s;hould &s;eem officious, this has rarely ever been at|tempted. Both Church and State were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the imbecility of this method; therefore, about 14 years after, viz. in 1662, the General Court called a Synod, to an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tions, one of which was, "Whether, according to the word of God, there ought to be a con&s;ociation of Churches, and what &s;hould be the manner of it?"</P>
<P>The Synod an&s;wer, that "there hath con&s;tantly been in the&s;e Churches a profe&s;&s;ion of communion in giving the right hand of fellow&s;hip at the gathering of Church|es, and ordination of Elders; which importeth a con&s;ociation, and obligeth to the practice of it."</P>
<P>They propo&s;e con&s;ociations of tho&s;e who live in convenient vicinity; though with liberty re&s;erved with|out offence, to make u&s;e of others. But con&s;idering all Congregational Churches as one general con&s;ocia|tion, out of which any parties may choo&s;e at plea&s;ure; that plan of cla&s;&s;ical or local con&s;ociations never was adopted in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; yet, in conformity thereto, mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters have formed them&s;elves into a&s;&s;o|ciations. The que&s;tion therefore returns; what &s;hall be done in ca&s;e of difficulty in a Church, and one par|ty refu&s;es to join in calling in a Council? It will no doubt be an&s;wered, if we were formed into con&s;ocia|tions according to the propo&s;al of that Synod, they might apply to the Con&s;ociation and that would be val|id, being e&s;tabli&s;hed by both Church and State. But it was equally acknowledged by both Church and State at the &s;ame time; that all Congregational Churches are one general con&s;ociation. Hence by plain and conclu&s;ive rea&s;on; if one party is ob&s;tinate and will not join in applying to the Con&s;ociation,
<PB N="50" REF="026757_0049_0FD1C2A22E34E738">
when the ca&s;e requires it; according to the principles and con&s;titution of Congregational Churches; the other party, after having u&s;ed proper means to induce them to it, has a <HI>right</HI> to call in &s;uch Churches as they think proper, and it mu&s;t be valid; for every man ought to find his remedy, and not be defeated becau&s;e his antagoni&s;t is ob&s;tinate, and the other party is ju&s;tly holden to abide the con&s;equences; for, in the very formation of a Church they are con&s;ociated, and ev|ery member is included in the con&s;ociating covenant, and all are bound to conform to con&s;ociation acts re|&s;pecting them; and if they refu&s;e, they break their covenant, and forfeit their relation, and ought to be con&s;idered as excommunicates, or <HI>outlaws;</HI> till they will regularly reunite with the Con&s;ociation, by con|forming to their decrees; or properly join with the other party, in mutually applying to the Con&s;ociation according to Church u&s;age or cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>But here &s;ome make a difficulty in what you will &s;carcely think they can make any, viz. about a <HI>Mutual Council.</HI> You will &s;carcely believe this can need any explanation.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hould not think it needed any; had I not heard &s;everal ab&s;urd and contemptible <HI>aphori&s;ms,</HI> in earne&s;t a&s;&s;erted, and ob&s;tinately maintained; to &s;erve a &s;elfi&s;h, contracted de&s;ign. In which are the following, viz. <HI>A Mutual Council is one cho&s;en by both Parties involving into one Body! Or when one Party</HI> (for certain rea&s;ons) <HI>gives up to, or con&s;ents that the other Party may choo&s;e all;</HI> this is a Mutual Council. The&s;e you will readily conceive are made by the <HI>Party</HI> who know they have numbers &s;ufficient to &s;wallow up the other <HI>Party</HI> and not feel any incumbrance thereby
<PB N="51" REF="026757_0050_0FD1C2A362DA7858">
You will al&s;o readily &s;ee that the&s;e &s;chemes are repug|nant to any &s;uch thing as <HI>Mutual:</HI> where there is but one acting body, there can be no mutual actions of parts or parties, <HI>&s;implicity</HI> and <HI>mutuality</HI> being repugnant to each other.</P>
<P>But I have heard other &s;chemes for a <HI>mutual</HI> Coun|cil, which though not &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as the above, yet are a great mi&s;take, and wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with the pattern we have in the 15th Chap. of Acts. The &s;cheme is, <HI>for both parties to agree to all the men, &s;o as to get a Coun|cil all of one mind as much as po&s;&s;ible.</HI> This certainly is not according to the <HI>pattern,</HI> for there was much di&s;|puting among them. And, in &s;uch a Council, all of one mind about a que&s;tion before them, there is no means to bring the truth to light; and if they happen to be in an error, they are likely to remain &s;o. Con&s;equently where there are differing parties, it appears mo&s;t ac|cording to Scripture and rea&s;on, that each party &s;hould equally choo&s;e; and this is the only way there can be any mutual choice; con&s;equently <HI>Mutual Council.</HI> But many object again&s;t this, &s;aying the Council come to|gether like two armies. But &s;o long as we know that this method is according to Scripture, rea&s;on, and the mo&s;t likely way to inve&s;tigate the truth; we need not be terrified by any epithets that may be put upon it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW give you my thoughts, as to the <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of Congregational Churches to di&s;mi&s;s or remove their Officers. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the
<PB N="52" REF="026757_0051_0FD1C2A92908D260">
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing of a Pa&s;tor; for other Officers of the Church, even if they have Ruling Elders, are never con&s;idered as having any official power out of their own Church; or to do any official act. Hence their introduction into office is never taken notice of by other Churches, neither were they con&s;idered by the Synod in 1662, as being e&s;&s;ential to the organization of a Church. Moreover, as to any other Officer in the Church be&s;ide the Pa&s;tor; their being in office or out of office does not affect their local &s;ituation, or temporal circum&s;tances. But a Pa&s;tor's or Mini&s;ter's local &s;ituation and condition of life are wholly deter|mined by his office. <HI>For the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the Go&s;pel &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel;</HI> even as all other occupations live of their labours, or by their occupations. For Chri&s;t, when he &s;ent out his Di&s;ciples, forbade their taking with them of their own e&s;tate to live upon; either <HI>pur&s;e</HI> or <HI>&s;crip; for the la|bourer is worthy of his meat,</HI> and of his wages or hire. Hence, God provided in his law to I&s;rael, even that the Prie&s;thood &s;hould be hereditary, with a &s;uitable living annexed; &s;o that the mini&s;tering office in his Church might not run out, and be void. For it would be irrational and incon&s;i&s;tent with God's creation of man and in&s;titutions to him, for any man to undertake a calling which in its own nature would dive&s;t him of all the &s;ocial enjoyments, and good things of this life; which God had created for man and conferred upon him. And though God has not made the mini&s;terial office in the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation hereditary; yet he has very plainly in&s;tituted, that a Bi&s;hop &s;hould have a family, and ordained that he &s;hould live by his la|bour in his office, and lay up for his family, as another
<PB N="53" REF="026757_0052_0FD1C2AC73F6AC60">
man may, by his labour and occupation. All which are ab&s;olutely incompatible with an un&s;ettled life; therefore fully amounts to an in&s;titution of God, that a Bi&s;hop's office is for life; indefea&s;able, unle&s;s he for|feits it by mi&s;demeanor. Hence the Platform a&s;&s;igns <HI>incorrigible offending</HI> as the only ground of removing an Elder from his office. This e&s;&s;entially implies that there have been means u&s;ed to reclaim the Elder, for no one can be deemed incorrigible, till means have been u&s;ed to recover or gain him. This mu&s;t be done according to Chri&s;t's law, as I have before &s;hown, re|&s;pecting di&s;cipline; or it can be no means to recover or gain him. There be tho&s;e who pretend that the&s;e private &s;teps are not to be u&s;ed with the Pa&s;tor; but no one that ever I heard, did or could a&s;&s;ign any &s;crip|ture or rea&s;on why a Pa&s;tor &s;hould be deprived of this privilege. Chri&s;t no where makes any &s;uch exemp|tion; but by the Apo&s;tle Paul to Timothy, appears rather to ratify it to them, above others, where he &s;ays; <HI>a gain&s;t an Elder receive not an accu&s;ation, but before two or three Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> This, &s;o literally referring to the law in the 18th of Matth. is a plain command or interdiction, again&s;t calling an Elder in que&s;tion as faulty, unle&s;s on the mo&s;t regular proce&s;s and decided proof according to law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This being &s;poken to Timothy, exactly agrees with what Mr. Davenport &s;ays, Page 137, that a Church's dealing with their Elder, and que&s;tioning him mu&s;t do it by the advice, and under the pre&s;idency, of neighbouring Pa&s;tors and to this an&s;wers the common u&s;age of Churches having a neighbouring Pa&s;tor motioned for, when a difficulty is with a Mini&s;ter.</NOTE> It is evident by the expre&s;s letter of the Platform, that a Mini&s;ter &s;hall not be re|moved for &s;ome foibles; or as Mr. Hooker calls them <HI>petty aberrations;</HI> nor even if he is overtaken in a real
<PB N="54" REF="026757_0053_0FD1C2ADC971C150">
<HI>fault,</HI> &s;ome violation of a divine rule; unle&s;s he con|tinue irreclaimable in it. All this mu&s;t be manife&s;t, Chap. viii. Sec. 7. Here is a que&s;tion. To whom is this to be manife&s;t? Is it to the accu&s;ers? Why may we not as well &s;ay it mu&s;t be manife&s;t to the ac|cu&s;ed? One party has as good a right to be judges as the other. What is &s;aid in the 10th Chap. Sec. 6, de|cides this; it mu&s;t be manife&s;t or evident to the <HI>Coun|cil of other Churches;</HI> who are to <HI>direct to the removal of an incorrigibly offending Elder;</HI> in order that the Church may have <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s or remove him.</P>
<P>That this is the true intent and meaning of the Platform, as to di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an Elder; you will readily allow when you recollect what I before mentioned from Mr. Hooker, where he a&s;&s;erts, that a Church mu&s;t proceed or not, according to the advice of the Coun|cil. And you will be further e&s;tabli&s;hed in this con&s;truction of the Platform, by viewing the &s;enti|ments or various other writers both before and &s;ince the Platform, and the uniform practice of the compil|ers of it, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for above an hundred years; in which you will find previous to the Plat|form, be&s;ide Mr. Hooker, Mr. Cotton on the Keys: which book it is a&s;&s;erted by ancient writers, was u&s;ed as a guide or Platform, by the New England Churches, before the Platform was made. Dr. Increa&s;e Mather and other Mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton, in their Te&s;timony to the order of the Churches, in the year 1720, &s;ay, that in Mr. Cotton's Book of the Keys he a&s;&s;erts, "That it is an ordinance of Chri&s;t, for particular Churches to join together in a con&s;ociation among them&s;elves, to admini&s;ter their Church affairs which are

of <HI>weighty, difficult, and common concernment;</HI> of which kind he reckons <HI>the Election, Ordination or Excommu|nication of an Elder or any Per&s;on of public note.</HI>"</P>
<P>You will be gratified in hearing &s;omething from the compo&s;itions and writings &s;ince the Platform.</P>
<P>In this venerable throng, is the Synod in 1662, (a|bout 14 years after the Platform) which a&s;&s;ert the du|ty and importance of Con&s;ociations or Councils, in <HI>matters of more than ordinary importance; as Ordina|tion, Tran&s;lation, and Depo&s;ition of Elders and &s;uch like.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident that writers both before and &s;ince the Platform, con&s;ider the relation between Pa&s;tor and People very &s;acred, and not to be ra&s;hly and precipi|tately di&s;&s;olved, even if both &s;ides were di&s;po&s;ed for it, not to be done without the advice or concurrence of a Council of other Churches. Dr. Increa&s;e Ma|ther and other Mini&s;ters, in their beforementioned Te&s;timony, &s;ay, "That as there is, according to the order and practice of the&s;e Churches, a Council for the <HI>ordaining a Pa&s;tor;</HI> it &s;tands to rea&s;on that there &s;hould as much be requi&s;ite for his removing."</P>
<P>But there are &s;till more important rea&s;ons tho&s;e writers allege again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution of the relation between a Pa&s;tor and his People, viz. becau&s;e they con&s;ider it a Covenant and very &s;imilar to the mar|riage relation.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forget Mr. Hooker. He &s;ays it is of the nature of the marriage relation in many re|&s;pects. And Mr. Wi&s;e, in his Church's Quarrel E&s;|pou&s;ed, compares the relation between Mini&s;ter and People to the marriage relation. His words are. "Hu&s;band and Wife, Pa&s;tor and Church, by our &s;ort of government, are bound for term of life, or &s;o long
<PB N="56" REF="026757_0055_0FD1C2B1898174D8">
as both &s;hall live; the&s;e Churches are &s;ettled Congre|gational, and by their principles, the <HI>ordination</HI> is, as it were, the nuptials or marriage day of two lovers, that nothing but death, or a bill of divorce (for betray|ing the glory of the union) can part." This, as far as I have had opportunity to ob&s;erve, has been the ge|neral notion and &s;en&s;e of people: but however more or le&s;s general it may have been; yet Mr. Wi&s;e's ob+&s;ervation and compari&s;on will appear to be ju&s;t, when we con&s;ider, that, upon Congregational principles, the Mini&s;ter's relation to his people is by mutual and vo|luntary choice and covenant; and his office relation is blended with his relation as a Brother in the Church, and al&s;o blended with his local &s;ituation and living in the world, through the whole of his life; that they can|not be parted: and has therefore nearly all the per|petual indi&s;&s;olvable ties that the marriage relation has.</P>
<P>And when we advert to &s;cripture, we &s;hall find, that God made it more indi&s;&s;olvable than the relation be|tween hu&s;band and wife: for the latter he allowed to be di&s;&s;olved becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts; but the former he made hereditary. Yet this was not &s;o, but that for high crimes and mi&s;demeanors they might be depo&s;ed. Thus <HI>Solomon</HI> thru&s;t out <HI>Abi|ather,</HI> for trea&s;on. This is the only in&s;tance we have in the Bible of any Prie&s;t's being regularly depo&s;ed by lawful authority. And Chri&s;t, though he reprobat|ed the practice of their putting away their wives for e|very cau&s;e; yet he allowed that the relation might be di&s;&s;olved in ca&s;e of <HI>fornication.</HI> And very &s;imilar to that, as if copied in imitation of it, the Platform al|lows a People to put away their Mini&s;ter, for <HI>incorrigi|bly offending.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026757_0056_0FD1C2B6E38D41E0">But as the marriage relation is not to be di&s;&s;olved by either party, even in ca&s;e of <HI>fornication,</HI> without the decree of divorce by proper authority: So neith|er may a Church put away their Mini&s;ter, even in ca&s;e of <HI>incorrigibly offending,</HI> without the <HI>Council of other Churches properly introduced, directing thereto.</HI> When, according to &s;uch <HI>direction,</HI> they have both <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to remove him from his office; or put him away.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter, I &s;aid that <HI>Abiather</HI> was the on|ly in&s;tance in the Bible, of a Prie&s;t's being regularly depo&s;ed by lawful authority; which I &s;uppo&s;e you will allow to be true; notwith&s;tanding Jeroboam when he &s;et up his fal&s;e religion, ca&s;t out, and in a &s;en&s;e de|po&s;ed, the Prie&s;ts of the Lord. And his having the major part of I&s;rael on his &s;ide did not &s;anctify his conduct herein; but it is always &s;poken of as his &s;in.</P>
<P>But, in the New Te&s;tament, we read of no Bi&s;hop or Elder's being &s;uper&s;eded or depo&s;ed: Or of their for&s;aking or leaving their people.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ome in our day a&s;&s;ert, <HI>that a Church may, or have a right to di&s;mi&s;s, or turn away their Mini&s;ter, when they plea&s;e, with a Council, or without; or contrary to a Council, and it will be valid. Otherwi&s;e, as the ca&s;e may be, they cannot get rid of a Mini&s;ter when he ought to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="026757_0057_0FD1C2BA0E054778">This &s;entiment will ju&s;tify all the villany that can be committed. Upon this doctrine or &s;entiment, a man may turn his wi&s;e out doors, when he plea&s;es, and it will be a valid divorce.</P>
<P>A ru&s;&s;ian may a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate a man when he plea&s;es; and it will be a lawful and ju&s;t putting him to death.</P>
<P>A thief or a robber may take away a man's proper|ty from him when he plea&s;es, and it will be a righteous conver&s;ion of property.</P>
<P>For <HI>the ca&s;e may be,</HI> that a woman <HI>ought to be divorced,</HI> a man <HI>ought to die,</HI> a man <HI>ought to have</HI> his dues of an|other; when neither of the&s;e things can be obtained in due cour&s;e of law; on this &s;entiment, therefore, the woman is not abu&s;ed by her hu&s;band, nor the de|cea&s;ed injured by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, nor the plundered per|&s;on, wronged by the robber: for according to this &s;entiment, the hu&s;band, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, the robber, have a <HI>right</HI> to perform all tho&s;e acts of violence: and there is no outrage or villany which may not be amply vin|dicated by it; and e&s;pecially all perfidy, breach of faith, and violation of covenants and contracts; for this, which is a&s;&s;erted in the very &s;entiment it&s;elf, is a <HI>right</HI> to break the mo&s;t &s;olemn, &s;acred and complicat|ed covenants that can po&s;&s;ibly be made.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of this ca&s;t call them&s;elves <HI>Independents;</HI> and have the audacity to father their &s;entiments on the Platform; when that utterly rejects <HI>Independents.</HI> But let them call them&s;elves what they will, according to what I have before noticed from the Synod in 1662, and from Dr. Mather, of the determinations of the General Court; and the practice of the Churches from the beginning; the&s;e <HI>Independents</HI> are OUT|LAWS of both Church and State, and they very gro&s;ly
<PB N="59" REF="026757_0058_0FD1C2BB42B7C530">
defame the Platform in pretending to father &s;uch &s;en|timents upon it; and they are un&s;ufferably a&s;&s;uming and arrogant; for by their pretending to father &s;uch &s;entiments on the Platform, they no le&s;s than boldy a&s;&s;ert that they under&s;tand it, better than the compil|ers of it, and Mini&s;ters and General Court in the time of it; and for &s;ome years after, while the compil|ers of it were alive. Such arrogant monopolizers of wi&s;dom, as Mr. Wi&s;e &s;ays, "<HI>Defy and trample under foot the Honour and Authority of the Churches;</HI> and as he &s;ays in another place, <HI>&s;uch U&s;urpers in Churches, Affront the World.</HI>" And that the more, when the way they mu&s;t explain or read the Platform to get their &s;enti|ment from it, mu&s;t be to read it, as the vain wretch did the Bible, to prove from it, <HI>there is no God;</HI> who reads only the&s;e words, and a&s;&s;erts that it is proved from the Bible there is none. Or as another, to prove that the Bible directed to hearken to bad advice, reads it, <HI>My &s;on if &s;inners entice thee con&s;ent</HI> THOU. But if they &s;hould &s;ay, the&s;e are fabulous; they may turn to Mat. iv. 6. and find an example; which you will al|low, they cannot deny, either the authenticity of the example; or the fitne&s;s of the Author for their pattern. The example is, <HI>It is written he &s;hall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they &s;hall bear thee up.</HI> Here the words, <HI>To keep in all thy ways;</HI> are omitted in what was pretended to be quoted. So the&s;e Independents, as they call them&s;elves, mu&s;t read the Platform to make what they pretend from it. <HI>As the Church had power to call to office, &s;o they have power to remove him from his office.</HI> Here, as in the above text of Scripture, an e&s;&s;ential part is omitted, viz. <HI>The Council of other Churches, where it may be had, direct|ing thereto.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="026757_0059_0FD1C2BD37DDDD58">But though the Platform is &s;omewhat ob&s;cure as to this matter and many others, and is ea&s;ily accounted for; con&s;idering they had &s;o newly e&s;caped the fur|nace of Prelacy, and kept their eye &s;o intently on that, to guard again&s;t it, that they did not &s;o &s;trongly, in words, guard again&s;t evils among them&s;elves. Yet it is evident they were far from practi&s;ing any &s;uch things, as the licentious pretended Independents of the pre&s;ent day, claim by it. And the Synod in 1662, as I have frequently ob&s;erved, &s;et this matter in a clear light; who&s;e re&s;ult, is of as much and the &s;ame author|ity with the Platform it&s;elf, being &s;anctioned by both Church and State as much as that, and is as really a part of the Platform of the&s;e Churches, as the expla|natory Charter by King <HI>George,</HI> was really a part of the Charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, as that by <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI> Or as a codicil to a will, is as real|ly part of the will as the body of it; and mu&s;t be ex|ecuted, as much as any part of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e ancient worthies, were not &s;o vain and arro|gant as to &s;uppo&s;e they had arrived at the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of wi&s;dom, when they fir&s;t compo&s;ed the Platform in 1648.</P>
<P>Again I have &s;een it in writing &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted for a SENTIMENT, <HI>"That, the majority of a people ex|pre&s;&s;ing their minds again&s;t their Mini&s;ter, that he &s;hould not continue their Mini&s;ter, it &s;o vacates his office relation to them, that it is right for any other man to officiate in his place, whether he is willing or not."</HI></P>
<P>This &s;entiment has for its precedent in the Bible, the conduct of Jeroboam and the majority of I&s;rael, thru&s;ting out the Prie&s;ts of the Lord, and &s;upplying their place with others; which I mentioned to you
<PB N="61" REF="026757_0060_0FD1C2BE4869E670">
before; and you will join with me in &s;aying it mat|ters not as to its being <HI>right,</HI> whether tho&s;e that are introduced to &s;upply, <HI>are of the lowe&s;t of the people;</HI> or tho&s;e that e&s;teem them&s;elves the <HI>highe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This SENTIMENT al&s;o cen&s;ures the conduct of <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> that they did not leave the people and give place to <HI>Korah, Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> when the major part of the people had &s;o expre&s;sly decided a|gain&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the &s;ervant of the Lord, and <HI>Aaron</HI> his Prie&s;t. For according to this &s;entiment, it was right for <HI>Korah,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume and occupy the Prie&s;t's Office in&s;tead of <HI>Aaron,</HI> when the majority of the people were &s;o de|cidedly for it. And it al&s;o impeaches the divine con|duct in the miraculous fire, and cha&s;m in the earth, which de&s;troyed them and their a&s;&s;ociates; and that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> were not rather the victims of ven|geance for their ob&s;tinacy and impiety in not being willing immediately to give place to them, when the majority of the people had &s;o expre&s;sly decided a|gain&s;t their continuing in office: For <HI>Vox populi, vox e&s;t Dei;</HI> Et, <HI>Voluntas populi Suprema e&s;t lex.</HI> The&s;e are fundamental maxims: yet the Declaration of Rights in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Con&s;titution of Government, has the audacity to claim that it &s;hall be a <HI>Government of Laws, and not of Men.</HI></P>
<P>The above &s;entiment is no doubt founded on a mi&s;|taken notion many people imbibe and ob&s;tinately hold, as to the temporary mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t to the twelve; when he &s;ent them to preach <HI>the kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</HI> to work miracles, &amp;c. He tells them who&s;o|ever &s;hall not <HI>receive you,</HI> &amp;c. when ye depart out of that hou&s;e or city, <HI>&s;hake off the du&s;t off your feet,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="62" REF="026757_0061_0FD1C2C014E9C280">
and in the &s;ame mi&s;&s;ion he tells them, if they <HI>per&s;ecute you in one city, flee to another.</HI> This direction of Chri&s;t to his Di&s;ciples in this &s;hort temporal itinerant mi&s;&s;ion, they ob&s;tinately hold and urge is a direction to &s;ettled Mini&s;ters. But it cannot be any thing to them; for as to them, the people have received them; and if they &s;tart off and flee, when difficulties, or &s;ome di&s;agreea|ble things ari&s;e, they prove them&s;elves not to be true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, or Pa&s;tors of his flock; but <HI>hire|lings</HI> who flee when they &s;ee the wolf come or coming.</P>
<P>This direction therefore of Chri&s;t to his Di&s;ciples, in that mi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s from one place to another, can be no direction to &s;ettled Mini&s;ters; to &s;uppo&s;e it to be a direction to them carries in it a contradiction in terms.</P>
<P>But the Commi&s;&s;ion which was to la&s;t to the end of the world, was, to preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature; to teach them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded, which includes all the divine precepts, and to admini&s;ter his ordinances; all which was at fir&s;t to the Apo&s;tles, extraordinary Officers from Chri&s;t, who were to introduce the Go&s;pel, being accompanied with the power of Miracles. This belonging to their mi&s;&s;ion, it was incompatible with a &s;ettled life. But after they had planted Churches, they ordained Bi&s;h|ops, Pa&s;tors, Teachers or Elders, to rule and feed the Church; who&s;e office relation was more e&s;pecially &s;tated and local, which is the office now in the Church of Chri&s;t which is under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>This office relation, as you have heard, is blended with &s;o many covenant ties, and connected with &s;o many conditions and circum&s;tances of very great mag|nitude and importance; and &s;o ratified, e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="63" REF="026757_0062_0FD1C2C21BB41638">
and made permanent by God's Word; that it may not be trifled with, or &s;lightly di&s;&s;olved. Thus Dr. Math|er and other Mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton, in their Te&s;timony before mentioned, &s;peaking of the removal of a Pa&s;tor, where the Pa&s;tor him&s;elf is for parting, &s;ay, it mu&s;t be proceeded in with great caution, <HI>that it becomes not any Mini&s;ter to &s;eek it by offering him&s;elf to it.</HI> That the rea&s;ons for removal be laid before authentic judges, &s;uch as are mo&s;t likely to pa&s;s an impartial judgment upon them, that nothing le&s;s than a Council of Church|es may be tho&s;e judges, and that the rea&s;ons be found &s;uch as are con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;olemn vow he is under.</P>
<P>In the Preface of &s;aid Te&s;timony it is &s;aid that, about 20 years after the Platform, it was a&s;&s;erted and vindi|cated, that the ordaining, depo&s;ing and tran&s;lating of a Pa&s;tor &s;hould be by common con&s;ent; and that it was &s;o in the next ages after the Apo&s;tles. By this <HI>common con&s;ent,</HI> they mean not only the Pa&s;tor and Peo|ple, but other Churches.</P>
<P>From all which you will &s;ee that it is a violation of our Congregational principles, and therefore unlawful, for a Pa&s;tor and people to part, by his motion, or by theirs, or both; or by the people pretending a fault in him; without the advice and concurrence of a Coun|cil. As the Platform makes no provi&s;ion for remov|ing an Elder from his office; <HI>but upon incorrigibly of|fending, and the Council of other Churches directing to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> All other pretences of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of an Elder are ab&s;olutely unknown by the Platform.</P>
<P>However I will not pretend to a&s;&s;ert that there can be no di&s;&s;olution of the relation, between Pa&s;tor and People, unle&s;s by his <HI>incorrigibly offending</HI> and the ad|vice
<PB N="64" REF="026757_0063_0FD1C2C3A0D17188">
of Council. There may be by agreement to part, and a Council a&s;&s;enting to it, as Dr. Mather and Min|i&s;ters of Bo&s;ton propo&s;e; which you recollect; and I will not &s;ay it is a violation of Congregational princi|ples, or unlawful. And there have been in&s;tances of later years where Councils have advi&s;ed to a &s;epara|tion on account of the unea&s;ine&s;s of the people; with provi&s;o for a &s;ettlement of his contract; &s;imilar to Mo&s;es' &s;uffering I&s;rael to put away their wives becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts. <HI>But from the begin|ning it was not &s;o.</HI> Neither from the beginning of God's in&s;tituting the Prie&s;thood; nor from the beginning of &s;etting up Congregationali&s;m in this country. For as I before &s;aid, the Platform knows of no &s;uch way of Mini&s;ter and People parting. But though the&s;e various grounds or occa&s;ions of Pa&s;tor and People's parting, have been tolerated, and may be thought to be rea&s;on|able or lawful where it is done by agreement or con|&s;ent of all parties, viz. the Pa&s;tor, the People, and the Con&s;ociation, i. e. a Council of Churches. Yet for any Mini&s;ter to break from his People without their con&s;ent, and the advice of Council; or for any people to pretend to di&s;mi&s;s or turn away their Mini&s;|ter of them&s;elves at their own plea&s;ure, and by their own power, is &s;uch a breach of faith and infraction on the whole foundation of &s;ociety as I pre&s;ume cannot be found among the mo&s;t &s;avage nations; I am very certain the aboriginals of this country would &s;corn &s;uch perfidy. And for them to pretend to ju&s;tify it by the Platform, becau&s;e the Platform po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts and &s;crupulou&s;ly re&s;erves to Mini&s;ters and People the right of covenanting and contracting, and of holding this right, in oppo&s;ition to prelatical impo&s;ition or de&s;ea&s;ance;
<PB N="65" REF="026757_0064_0FD1C2CA577F9C18">
and therein &s;aying that they have a right to <HI>choo&s;e</HI> and <HI>refu&s;e;</HI> that the Churches' having a right to covenant; no power, without their con&s;ent, can di&s;&s;olve it. For any to &s;ay, or pretend to argue, that becau&s;e a people have a right to make a covenant or contract, they have a right to break it and avoid their obligation at plea|&s;ure, without the agreement or con&s;ent of all par|ties, or a forfeiture on one &s;ide; is a heinous reproach on the compilers of the Platform, and an affront upon common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>And for any people to turn away or reject their Mini&s;ter when he is old, or by infirmity is pa&s;t, or nearly pa&s;t, his labour; re&s;embles the practice of tho&s;e &s;avage nations who turn off their parent into the de&s;erts in their old age, to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>A reflection on what I have wrote in this and the foregoing letter, I doubt not will induce you to join with me, in &s;aying, that the practice which is &s;o preva|lent, and growing at this day, of Mini&s;ter and People making particular agreements about parting, on any other conditions, or in any other way, than the general plan of the Scriptures and Platform, is very improper, and a great evil. It is un&s;afe both for Mini&s;ter and Peo|ple. Many people &s;eem to be fond of having it expre&s;&s;|ed in their &s;ettling a Mini&s;ter, that he &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed when a major part or a major vote &s;hall be again&s;t him. They mu&s;t allow the &s;ame to the Mini&s;ter. Such a precarious tenure is no &s;ettlement either of Mini&s;ter or People, and mu&s;t in its own nature keep Mini&s;ters and People perpetually fluctuating.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter does not &s;tand upon <HI>good behaviour,</HI> but upon <HI>plea&s;ure;</HI> he is therefore under a temptation to be a time&s;erver, if he wi&s;hes to &s;tay with the Peo|ple:
<PB N="66" REF="026757_0065_0FD1C2CCE4B71410">
And at the &s;ame time he is al&s;o under a tempta|tion to be plotting for a more promi&s;ing and perma|nent place and employment; and prudence and duty will dictate, that he always is looking out and ready for a retreat. And in this ca&s;e, if he has a proper foreca&s;t, he will &s;ee that he has a much larger &s;alary that he may lay up for old age, or infirmity, when he is near pa&s;t his labour. When it will be almo&s;t a miracle if the people do not take care to rid them&s;elves of a burden; when he is &s;o old or infirm he cannot &s;ettle again, or go into any other bu&s;ine&s;s, and mu&s;t lo&s;e the re&s;t of his time: and if he does not take care of this to have an additional &s;alary, it will be his pru|dence to avail him&s;elf of his own liberty to go, and take his day before him. And this precarious &s;cheme mu&s;t in its own nature tend to breed jealou&s;ly be|tween Mini&s;ter and People; and it is inviting to re&s;t|le&s;s, litigious minds, innumerable occa&s;ions to excite a party and di&s;mi&s;s a Mini&s;ter in a heat; it may be, in revenge upon the Mini&s;ter, or &s;ome other per&s;ons in the town or pari&s;h.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned all the evils I di&s;cern in that way; neither do I &s;uppo&s;e I could po&s;&s;ibly think of all it is expo&s;ed to. I will only add, that it is &s;o con|trary to what God has e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to the religious order of men, that doubtle&s;s it mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to innumerable evils; the greate&s;t of which is, it tends to run out the Mini&s;try, and all religious order, e&s;|pecially &s;ince it is a departure from order and a breach of the Fellow&s;hip of Churches.</P>

<P>THEORY, which leads into the principles of any art or &s;cience, will leave it &s;till in a great mea&s;ure in ob&s;curity without experience. Thus you &s;ee it was with the compilers of the Platform, and other writers of that day, there appears profound theory in their compo&s;itions; but for want of experience, &s;ome dark &s;ayings, which men of corrupt minds wre&s;t as they do al&s;o the holy Scriptures: notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e wi&s;e and pious worthies, by practice and experience, &s;oon di&s;covered and explained them, not only by particu|lar able writers, but by the &s;ame formality and author|ity by which the Platform it&s;elf was made. But not|with&s;tanding all the light which they have offered and left for their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e who choo&s;e darkne&s;s rather than light, who love not the truth, but delight in iniquity; have furni&s;hed us of the pre&s;ent day with many very &s;triking in&s;tances of the &s;ubver&s;ion of or|der in Congregationali&s;m.</P>
<P>A few ca&s;es of this kind may reflect &s;ome light on what I have e&s;&s;ayed to give you as the theory of Con|gregationali&s;m.</P>
<P>Among which ca&s;es you will join with me in con|&s;idering it as a very dark &s;cene in PROVIDENCE, when a People violently break off from their Mini&s;ter; and, becau&s;e they can have a majority, employ a &s;trang|er, like a young <HI>Korah,</HI> to crowd out their aged Pa&s;tor, whom they ought highly to e&s;teem, in love, for his work
<PB N="68" REF="026757_0067_0FD1C2D097A22BC0">
&s;ake; and to venerate as a Father. Yet they load him with calumny, by accu&s;ations to de&s;troy his min|i&s;terial character. And like the people running upon <HI>Stephen,</HI> &s;top their ears again&s;t his repeated and earne&s;t entreaties to join with him in calling in a Mutual Coun|cil. They pretend to di&s;mi&s;s him, yet refu&s;e to give an official copy of their proceedings. To crown their in&s;ults, <HI>a boy</HI> is &s;ent to inform him they <HI>have no more &s;ervice for him.</HI> The Pa&s;tor, with a few friends that adhered to him, called in a Council twice, who ince&s;|&s;antly laboured to bring them to peace, but un&s;ucce&s;&s;|fully; they acquit the Pa&s;tor of the accu&s;ations again&s;t him, and approve of his conduct. But the majority, like the multitude again&s;t Chri&s;t, cry out, away with this man and choo&s;e <HI>Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a rob|ber.</HI> So here they cho&s;e another, rather than their ag|ed and Reverend Pa&s;tor, to rob him of his people, his Meeting Hou&s;e and his living; and &s;end to other Churches, as the people applied to Pilate to a&s;&s;i&s;t and gratify them in their outrage.</P>
<P>What they will &s;tile them&s;elves, I know not; neith|er do I know of any ONE cla&s;s or denomination they rank with. I will therefore for the pre&s;ent, leave them with the &s;tile of POLYKAKONONYMOUS.</P>
<P>There is no plea&s;ure in relating &s;uch <HI>tales.</HI> But e|vil conduct and con&s;equences, by the divine direction, are &s;ometimes to be related for an admonition to tho&s;e that come after; to the intent they &s;hould not lu&s;t af|ter evil things.</P>
<P>A wealthy people who had always been favoured with Mini&s;ters of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters, their Mini&s;ter by age and incidental infirmities became un|able to &s;upply; they employ a candidate, they invite
<PB N="69" REF="026757_0068_0FD1C2D1C2A75A10">
him to &s;ettle with them, colleague with their aged Pa&s;|tor; he accepts their invitation. But, before ordina|tion, &s;everal re&s;pectable characters in the pari&s;h be|came &s;u&s;picious of his character; a large and re&s;pectable Council was invited for ordination, who had &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions, and after a long and deliberate hearing, con|cluded, it was not proper he &s;hould be ordained there.</P>
<P>The major part determined they would have him, in oppo&s;ition to this full, fair and deliberate trial and de|ci&s;ion of that Mutual Council, the only con&s;titutional power to determine it; break off from Congregation|ali&s;m, erect them&s;elves into a &s;eparate &s;ociety by the name of <HI>The New Reformed Catholic Society in</HI>&mdash;. Their refu&s;e condidate joins with them, and they &s;end to Churches, and rai&s;e a <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> to FOSTER their proceedings and conduct; and thus a venerable di|vine, and once happy people, are almo&s;t de&s;olate.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e Man tells us, the way of the &s;trange wo|man is variable. You will not wonder therefore that the following ca&s;e differs in many things from tho&s;e I have related.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable town which had long been noted for union and good order; &s;ettled a Mini&s;ter in peace. But &s;oon there aro&s;e a di&s;affection, and &s;ome move|ments again&s;t him. <HI>The beginning of &s;trife is as when one letteth out water:</HI> The breach is con&s;tantly increa&s;|ing. So here the contention increa&s;ed till the di&s;affected party called in an ex parte Council, who advi&s;ed them to deal with their Pa&s;tor according to the xviiith of Matth. and, if they could not obtain &s;atisfaction there|by, to &s;eek for a Mutual Council. They execute the proce&s;s. The Church acquit the Pa&s;tor. The op|po&s;ers
<PB N="70" REF="026757_0069_0FD1C2D74AAAED30">
are not &s;atisfied; the Church offer to join in a Mutual Council. But the di&s;affected do not ac|cede to it: they call in their ex parte Council again; who, upon their arrival, expre&s;s their <HI>&s;ur|prize;</HI> and being &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their condition, they prudently waved entering into any examination of the <HI>Scripture Authority</HI> of the proceedings of the Church; and RETIRED.</P>
<P>Both parties then joined and invited a large Mutu|al Council, who came, deliberated on their matters, and re&s;ulted thereon. In which they advi&s;ed the Church <HI>to exerci&s;e tenderne&s;s and candour to their Pa&s;tor, and all parties concerned, carefully to guard again&s;t prejudice and cultivate a &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian love.</HI></P>
<P>Within a month after this Mutual Council, a town meeting was called to take mea&s;ures to remove their Mini&s;ter; and to choo&s;e a committee to &s;upply the pulpit with a preacher, and to take care of the meet|ing hou&s;e until it can be done. Many of the inhabi|tants prote&s;ted again&s;t their proceedings.</P>
<P>They met, and voted they had no further &s;ervice for their Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>About &s;ix weeks after the above Mutual Council and advice; without any new matter offered to the Pa&s;tor or Church; part of the Church &s;end out for a Council. They came, expre&s;&s;ing their <HI>regret</HI> of a divi&s;ion in the town; they recognize tho&s;e that are di&s;affected with their Mini&s;ter <HI>The Original Church.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this, about half the Church form, and &s;tile them&s;elves, <HI>The Original Church, in</HI>&mdash;, vote the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of their Mini&s;ter. The town vote it al&s;o.</P>
<P>Soon after the&s;e movements the Pa&s;tor warned a Church meeting. In which meeting, the Pa&s;tor
<PB N="71" REF="026757_0070_0FD1C2DCF00019E8">
and Church mutually agreed to invite in a Coun|cil, to look into their &s;ituation and give their ad|vice. They came, attended to their matters, and re&s;ult|ed; that the Mutual Council, <HI>left the Pa&s;tor and Church in good &s;tanding, and that they have done nothing &s;ince to forfeit their &s;tanding, and advi&s;e to hold on and per&s;evere.</HI></P>
<P>Between the time of &s;ending for this Council, and their coming; the town &s;hut the meeting hou&s;e again&s;t the Pa&s;tor. And &s;oon after &s;upply the pulpit with oth|er preachers.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, tho&s;e who conduct thus, are not Con|gregationali&s;ts; they do not act as if they were under any covenant obligation, either to their Pa&s;tor, or to one another; or in any con&s;ociated connexion or ob|ligation to other Churches; nor under any obligation to their Pa&s;tor or one another to &s;eek and conform to con&s;ociated advice and coun&s;el. Certainly they can|not be con&s;idered as Congregationali&s;ts. Neither can they be called <HI>Independents;</HI> for they &s;eek help from other Churches; which is incompatible with Inde|pendency.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, though they &s;eek help; it is not that they hold to any reciprocity of duty or obligation; what they are after is to get their own ends an&s;wered; but they do not hold them&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible, or under a|ny obligation to conform to their advice or determina|tion, as you &s;ee in the ca&s;es.</P>
<P>You will a&s;k, if they are neither <HI>Congregationali&s;ts</HI> nor <HI>Independents.</HI> What are they?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer. They are a <HI>mongrel</HI> production between both. And you will recollect that <HI>mongrels</HI> and <HI>mu&s;|lins</HI> and <HI>lin&s;ey wool&s;ey,</HI> were forbidden by the divine law; it is &s;uppo&s;ed by expo&s;itors that this law original|ly had a &s;pecial eye to mixtures in religion, and for|bidding
<PB N="72" REF="026757_0071_0FD1C2DFA8DC6360">
them; to guard them from admitting any heathen in&s;titutions with the ordinances of God. In this view you will grant that law is of as much force now as ever. Hence the Bible is expre&s;sly again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you will not envy any &s;et of exi&s;tences the honour of being the <HI>&s;ires</HI> or <HI>manufacturers</HI> of &s;uch <HI>mongrels</HI> or <HI>lin&s;ey wool&s;ey</HI> productions.</P>
<P>However, though the Bible is again&s;t them, yet there is a &s;ampler of them in the Bible; turn to the xviith Chap. 2d Kings. You find that the people who dwelt in the cities of <HI>Samaria</HI> were infe&s;ted with lions; which they attributed to their not knowing the manner of the God of the land; and they got one of the Prie&s;ts of the land to teach them the manner of the God; and he taught them. <HI>Howbeit every nation made Gods of their own. So they feared the Lord and &s;erved their own Gods.</HI></P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve the analogy. It is tho&s;e that occupy the place of <HI>Congregationali&s;ts,</HI> as tho&s;e of old did the land of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> They meet with difficulty in their religious &s;chemes. They &s;end for Congrega|tionali&s;ts, to teach them the manner of the God, or to put on the ma&s;k. Howbeit they are not Congrega|tionali&s;ts after all. They &s;till <HI>&s;erve their own Gods.</HI> Serve their own views, without any regard to recipro|cal duty and re&s;pon&s;ibility. The analogy goes through, tho&s;e of old and the&s;e now; all agree in &s;eek|ing help as to their difficulties from the Prie&s;t of the Lord. Yet there was then a variety among them as to their Gods. One was <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">gol,</HI> another <HI>A&s;himo,</HI> &amp;c. So it is now; one is the <HI>New Reformed Catholic,</HI> another <HI>The Original Church,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="026757_0072_0FD1C2E0C4A7C1D8">The analogy appears to me &s;o exact, that I &s;ee not why they may not with tho&s;e of old, properly be de|nominated SAMARITANS.</P>
<P>In the 4th Chap. of Ezra you find, that tho&s;e an|cient Samaritans applied to the Governor, Prie&s;t, and chief Fathers, offering to join and be connected with them in building the hou&s;e of God; but they would have nothing to do with them, or have any connexion with them. Which no doubt you will e&s;teem a divine ex|ample, how to treat all &s;uch <HI>Samaritani&s;t</HI> people. And as tho&s;e wi&s;e and pious Fathers a&s;&s;erted they would build the Hou&s;e of God, as the King had command|ed: So Congregationali&s;ts, I &s;uppo&s;e, would do well to be tenacious of their con&s;titution as was e&s;tabli&s;hed by civil authority.</P>
<P>After I had written the foregoing ca&s;es I recollect|ed a ca&s;e of a Mini&s;ter with his people which I &s;aw publi&s;hed in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Spy,</HI> 25th of April, 1793.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to give you even a minute account of what is there publi&s;hed. I will give you the general idea which I collected from &s;aid publica|tion. Which is, that there aro&s;e a di&s;turbance with the Mini&s;ter about his dome&s;tic affairs, particularly a|bout his daughter; that they accu&s;ed and judged him without any regard to the law of Chri&s;t in the 18th Chap. of Matth. That the Mini&s;ter repeatedly offer|ed to refer all matters to a mutual Council; which they as often refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But at length, in December 1791, they had a Coun|cil, which they claimed the exclu&s;ive prerogative of choo&s;ing all them&s;elves. The Mini&s;ter con&s;ented to this. This Council re&s;ult, that a &s;eparation take place
<PB N="74" REF="026757_0073_0FD1C2E298EA5390">
upon condition that if they could not agree on the pecuniary terms of their &s;eparation, they &s;ubmit the matter to indifferent men mutually cho&s;en, and abide the award. The Mini&s;ter offered to leave them, ac+cording to that re&s;ult of their own Council. But the people would not comply with it, although they vow|ed to comply with it; but in&s;tead of doing any thing to comply with their re&s;ult, they pretended to di&s;mi&s;s their Mini&s;ter them&s;elves: and did &s;hut the Meeting Hou&s;e again&s;t him. The Mini&s;ter has &s;ince often call|ed upon them to &s;ettle with him according to that re|&s;ult; and u&s;ed proper means to induce them to join with him in calling in a mutual Council, which they have always rejected. They applied to gentlemen to preach with them; but being un&s;ucce&s;sful, they appli|ed to the Church under the care of the Moderator of their own Council, to &s;end their Mini&s;ter to preach, &amp;c. among them. That Church returned an&s;wer to them that they could not think their Mini&s;ter was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed according to the re&s;ult. The Mini&s;ter called in a re&s;|pectable Council, who in their re&s;ult &s;ay, that his pa&s;t|oral relation continues, notwith&s;tanding all the people have done to di&s;mi&s;s him, and that he is in good &s;tand|ing, not having forfeited his mini&s;terial character. And very &s;olemnly exhort the people to return to their duty under his mini&s;try, or if they wi&s;h for a di&s;&s;olu|tion, to comply unre&s;ervedly with the re&s;ult of their own Council. The Mini&s;ter has &s;ince repeatedly urg|ed them to a &s;ettlement; and it appears has always of|fered, and &s;tood ready, to &s;ubmit all their differences to indifferent men mutually cho&s;en; but the people al|ways refu&s;ed, claiming to them&s;elves the &s;ole and ex|clu&s;ive prerogative of accu&s;ing, judging and execut|ing,
<PB N="75" REF="026757_0074_0FD1C2E3CFCAC538">
and of di&s;&s;olving their own engagements at plea|&s;ure, though ratified in the mo&s;t religious and &s;acred manner; defying and condemning all advice and de|ci&s;ions, of men and bodies of men, even when they had de&s;ired it, and promi&s;ed, (i. e. voted) to comply with it. They are not <HI>Independents,</HI> for they &s;eek help, but it is in a &s;upercilious manner as if all were to &s;erve them. They are not merely what I have above called <HI>Samaritans;</HI> for they vie with the <HI>Pope,</HI> in ex|alting him&s;elf with INFALLIBILITY above all <HI>obliga|tion,</HI> u&s;urping a <HI>right</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to break FAITH and di&s;pen&s;e with obligations at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>You will a&s;k, if they are neither Independents nor what I have denominated Samaritans; what are they? I know not what they will &s;tile them&s;elves. You know people of high ta&s;te affect to name their children after &s;ome high per&s;onage, and to &s;tile or denominate them&s;elves by &s;ome eminent patron, high character, per&s;onage or important name. I am content they &s;hould &s;earch the whole world for a patron, per&s;onage, or name, till they come to ADAM, and then they may denominate them&s;elves ADAMITES.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will ob&s;erve in the cour&s;e of the&s;e letters, that the Mini&s;ter's connexion with his people includes in it a civil covenant or contract blended with his other covenants with them; which is of great import|ance,
<PB N="76" REF="026757_0075_0FD1C2E436437EA8">
&s;ince his office is &s;o blended with his occupation, his local &s;ituation, his dome&s;tic comfort, and almo&s;t all circum&s;tances of life.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Platform does not fail to a&s;&s;ert the right and duty of civil authority's making provi&s;ion for the &s;upport and maintenance of Mini&s;ters, which the civil authority have generally done where Congre|gationali&s;m has prevailed; and I am well a&s;&s;ured there was an old law of the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, among other laws ratified and perpetuated by the con|&s;titution of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: Which enacts, <HI>"That the re&s;pective Churches &s;hall be encouraged in the peaceable and regular profe&s;&s;ion and practice of their Church order and di&s;cipline."</HI></P>
<P>I have in the&s;e letters given you my idea of what their order and di&s;cipline is; as e&s;tabli&s;hed by their Platform, Synods and u&s;age; now for more than an hundred and forty years. And Mr. Wi&s;e, in his Church's Quarrel e&s;pou&s;ed, &s;ays "Cu&s;tom, when full of days, and of noble examples, becomes the common law of a nation, and is as &s;overeign and pleadable as the dictates of parliamentary power." But you will readily join with me, in &s;aying, there is no <HI>peace, regu|larity</HI> or <HI>order,</HI> in &s;uch conduct as the ca&s;es I have mentioned. Nor any cu&s;tom of noble examples to legitimate or countenance them.</P>
<P>But &s;uch conduct, if countenanced and prevalent, mu&s;t, in its own nature, run out the Mini&s;try; for it mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with common prudence for men to undertake a calling which in its own nature and ac|cording to the tenor of it, de&s;troys them as to this world. It is what God never required of any or|der of men; but his word is expre&s;sly and abundant|ly
<PB N="77" REF="026757_0076_0FD1C2ECAAB9C650">
again&s;t it, e&s;pecially in his in&s;tituting religious offi|cers, both in the Old and New Te&s;tament. It is very common for many people to cry out again&s;t a mini&s;ter; if he takes any proper care of his &s;ecular intere&s;t, to call him a worldling, and &s;ay he is only after money; or &s;ome &s;uch opprobrious epithets. But therein they very highly and audaciou&s;ly reproach the divine in&s;ti|tution concerning that order of men, as well as vilify his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>But &s;uch di&s;order and clamour, not only de&s;troys Mini&s;ters; but de&s;troys &s;ociety, makes divi&s;ions in Par|i&s;hes, and di&s;ables them from &s;upporting the public wor&s;hip of God; and thus de&s;troys religion, and de|feats &s;ocial happine&s;s, and not only oppugnates the di|vine law, but undermines civil government: and in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts may properly be con&s;idered as a con&s;pir|acy again&s;t their con&s;titution, which &s;tates as a funda|mental maxim, <HI>"That the happine&s;s of a people, and the good order and pre&s;ervation of civil government</HI> ES|SENTIALLY <HI>depend upon piety, religion, and morality.</HI> And that the&s;e cannot be generally diffu&s;ed through a community; but by the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;h|ip of God and of public in&s;truction in piety, religion, and morality; therefore provides that the &s;everal towns, pari&s;hes, &amp;c. &s;hall make &s;uitable provi&s;ion, at their own expen&s;e, for the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and for the &s;upport of public Prote&s;tant Teach|ers of religion, &amp;c. And that the &s;everal towns, par|i&s;hes, &amp;c. &s;hall contract with their Teachers for their, &s;upport and maintenance." Hence &s;uch &s;chemes and practices as are incon&s;i&s;tent with, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of public Teachers of re|ligion, morality, and piety, are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> trea&s;on again&s;t that con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="026757_0077_0FD1C2EE57A3ECF8">Should therefore any &s;uch ca&s;es come before the civil authority, may we not depend that the civil ma|gi&s;trates, who are the guardians of Liberty and defend|ers of the Con&s;titution, will exert their authority to cru&s;h &s;uch trea&s;ons, and hold &s;uch covenants and con|tracts &s;acred; not &s;uffering people wantonly and arbi|trarily to avoid their contracts; or di&s;pen&s;e with their own engagements.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inve&s;tigation of CONGREGATIONALISM has required the obviating &s;o many perver&s;ions which &s;elfi&s;h minds have loaded upon it, to &s;erve partial views: and has lead into &s;o many ob&s;ervations on the various fal&s;e notions and wicked practices which have been fathered upon the Platform; that I doubt not you will take plea&s;ure in a <HI>&s;ummary review</HI> of the whole; in a concluding epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>CONGREGATIONALISM, as contained in the Scrip|tures, and explained by the Platform and other approv|ed authors, <HI>Is Congregations' covenanting to Walk in all the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. So many as can conveniently congregate togeth|er, or who&s;e local &s;ituation and circum&s;tances conve|niently admit of it; covenant to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded.</P>
<P N="2">2d. This Covenant being of &s;o great importance, it mu&s;t be ratified before proper witne&s;&s;es and author|ity;

which is called the gathering a new Church, un|der the countenance, and by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Council of Churches; or at lea&s;t of mini&s;ters. The members of the New Church &s;igning in their pre&s;ence, and receiving from them the <HI>right hand of fellow&s;hip:</HI> Or at lea&s;t, an owning of them in &s;ome explicit manner, a new branch added to the body of the Churches. This is a Con&s;ociating Covenant.</P>
<P N="3">3d. This Congregational Church, thus formed, have <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to choo&s;e proper Officers, &s;uch as Chri&s;t, the King, has in&s;tituted.

<P N="4">4th.

A Church thus organized with a ruling Officer, hath <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to exerci&s;e all parts of Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's In&s;titution, according to his laws: Intro|ducing all matters of complaint or accu&s;ation into the Church for a hearing and trial according to the 18th Chap. of Matth. having previou&s;ly &s;tated in writing the <HI>fact</HI> committed, and the <HI>Divine Law tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed,</HI> to the per&s;on accu&s;ed, in the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tep with him; for there can be no tre&s;pa&s;s, &s;in or fault, where there is no Divine Law or Rule tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e thus before the Church, they have <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to proceed according to the Laws of Chri&s;t, under the pre&s;idency of their Pa&s;tor, and fini&s;h it; unle&s;s there is a <HI>divi&s;ion</HI> about it; or it re&s;pects the <HI>Pa&s;tor:</HI> In which ca&s;es they are to call in a Council.</P>
<P>Here the ca&s;e is plain, if both parties mutually agree, and invite one by mutual choice. But if one party is ob&s;tinate, and will not join in &s;uch mutual choice and invitation; it is a que&s;tion of &s;ome import|ance; what &s;hall be done?</P>
<P>The Platform propo&s;es the third way of Communion. But this has rarely ever been attempted to be carried into practice; it is probable, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that when a matter is of public notoriety in the Church,
<PB N="81" REF="026757_0080_0FD1C2F4B2493310">
every one excu&s;es him&s;elf from undertaking to deal with an offender that he may not &s;eem officious.</P>
<P>It &s;eems both Church and State early &s;aw this; therefore called together the Synod in 1662, to an|&s;wer the que&s;tion, Whether there ought not to be Con|&s;ociations? The Synod an&s;wered, there ought to be. Yet this never was carried into execution. Perhaps all would &s;ay, if there were cla&s;&s;ical con&s;ociations and one party would not join; the other would have a right to complain to the Con&s;ociation, as well as to complain to a Civil Court in a civil matter.</P>
<P>I query why he may not complain to the Con&s;ocia|tion now, taking &s;uch and &s;o many of them as he thinks proper, after he has properly invited and rea&s;on|ably waited on the adver&s;e party to join with him? I &s;ee not why this &s;hould not be valid, and the adver&s;e party holden to abide the con&s;equences. For all Con|gregational Churches, are con&s;idered as one general Con&s;ociation combined for tho&s;e purpo&s;es; &s;o combin|ed by the manner of gathering a Church, and &s;ettling a Mini&s;ter, in which tran&s;actions every party and in|dividual by the nature and de&s;ign of them, covenant and engage to call in Councils; in all &s;uch ca&s;es as Congregational principles require them.</P>
<P>Such a Council ought not to be deemed a party Council, any more than a Civil Court, is a party court, becau&s;e one man &s;ues another before it, whom he can|not induce to &s;ettle with him otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>This can give no countenance to tho&s;e ex parte Councils, who take up matters before they have been properly prepared; or who go directly in the face of a fair mutual Council; or &s;oon after them, and pretend
<PB N="82" REF="026757_0081_0FD18D575E91AF00">
to act relative to tho&s;e things which have been before the mutual Council, contrary to what they have done. Such may be called party Councils indeed; and may doubtle&s;s be reckoned of tho&s;e who, Mr. Wi&s;e &s;ays, <HI>defy and trample under foot the Honour and Authority of the Churches.</HI></P>
<P>You will readily notice, from what I have &s;aid in the cour&s;e of my letters, that, upon Congregational principles, a &s;ingle Church is the executive power, in matters of di&s;cipline; yet mu&s;t execute or &s;tay execut|ing in ca&s;es of divi&s;ion, and re&s;pecting their Pa&s;tor, ac|cording to advice of Council, &s;imilar to executive pow|ers, in civil admini&s;tration. Which if they neglect or refu&s;e to do; their doings are invalid and void: And they forfeit the Fellow&s;hip of Churches; and a Coun|cil have a <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to declare &s;entence of <HI>Noncommunion</HI> again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="6">6th. A Church has <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to remove their Pa&s;tor from his office, for <HI>offending incorrigibly; a Council of other Churches directing thereto.</HI> And they may, by advice of Council, di&s;mi&s;s their Pa&s;tor in other ca&s;es, as I have &s;aid in the foregoing letters, when it is agreed to by all parties.</P>
<P>But their having a <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to choo&s;e their Officers; or to call to office, by no means gives them or implies a power to reject them at plea&s;ure, or to put them out of office, after they are in office; any more than a man's having a right to choo&s;e a wife and to choo&s;e the officer that &s;hall marry them, implies that he has a right to turn away his wife at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But people having this right to Covenant with their Mini&s;ter, makes &s;o much &s;tronger again&s;t their break|ing
<PB N="83" REF="026757_0082_0FD1C2F8DE1ECCD8">
from him, or pretending to turn him away: as a man's own voluntary act, is &s;tronger again&s;t him than what is in any &s;en&s;e impo&s;ed upon him. So the Plat|form, Chap. viii. Sec. 6th, "The Church being free, cannot become &s;ubject to any, but by a free election; yet when &s;uch a people do choo&s;e any to be over them in the Lord, then they do become &s;ubject."</P>
<P>And as a man has no right to break from his own voluntary Covenant; &s;o no one has any right to ab&s;olve him from his Covenant; or defea&s;e him of it.</P>
<P>This brings up to view the true intent and meaning of the Platform. Where it &s;peaks of the right of the people to choo&s;e and remove their own Officers. It is an a&s;&s;ertion of a Congregation's having a <HI>right</HI> to Cov|enant with their Officers, and to hold and enjoy their choice, in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Prelatical</HI> impo&s;ition, or de|fea&s;ance of Church Officers. And thus to a&s;&s;ert and fix this Covenant, where it ought to be, viz. on the &s;ame ground with all other Covenants of importance. Hence al&s;o Congregationali&s;ts do not admit that a Council &s;hould di&s;&s;olve this Covenant. Neither can one party di&s;&s;olve it.</P>
<P>But all covenants, being by mutual, voluntary con|&s;ent of parties, cannot be di&s;&s;olved; but by mutual con&s;ent and agreement of the original covenanting contracting parties, or by forfeiture on the one part.</P>
<P>And here you will notice that a Mini&s;ter's cove|nant with his People is involved in the con&s;ociating covenant by the manner of &s;olemnizing and ratifying of it. The Covenant between Mini&s;ter and People, therefore, cannot regularly be di&s;&s;olved without the con&s;ent and concurrence of a Council of Churches.
<PB N="84" REF="026757_0083_0FD1C2FC81FA2E08">
This is &s;acredly re&s;erved to every individual contract|ing party, the mutual and exclu&s;ive right of voluntary con&s;ent, to di&s;&s;olve his voluntary Covenant.</P>
<P>Hence, &s;hould a Mini&s;ter break away from his People without con&s;ent or agreement; he breaks Covenant with them, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; and breaks Covenant al&s;o with the Con&s;ociating Churches, and thereby forfeits his Covenant relation to them; and official character; and breaks his civil contract, forfeits that; and ought to pay damages as indifferent men &s;hall judge, and this has been the ca&s;e in &s;everal in&s;tances; where the Mini&s;ter did not break away; but only was the fir&s;t mover for parting, and they parted regularly by Council.</P>
<P>It is in all re&s;pects the &s;ame on the other &s;ide as to the People; with re&s;pect to their Mini&s;ter. Should they wi&s;h to have him leave them, or the relation di&s;|&s;olved without his <HI>incorrigible offence,</HI> it ought to be by advice of Council, and an allowance of damages to him as indifferent men &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>But if they crowd him away without his con&s;ent or the concurrence of a Council, they forfeit their fel|low&s;hip with the Con&s;ociating Churches; and ought to continue his &s;alary till they give a regular di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion, and aggravated damages be&s;ide: as indifferent men &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>Again &s;hould both Mini&s;ter and People agree and di&s;&s;olve their Covenant, without a Council; it would be irregular, incon&s;i&s;tent with Congregational princi|ples, and a breach of Fellow&s;hip of Churches.</P>
<P>Again, &s;hould an Elder <HI>offend incorrigibly,</HI> whereby he forfeits his Covenant and contract with his People.
<PB N="85" REF="026757_0084_0FD1C3034C8BAF68">
The People being one party, cannot, according to any rule of God or man, be judges of the delinquency or forfeiture of the other party; any more than the oth|er party may be judge of him&s;elf, which certainly he has as good a right to; as they have to judge him. Moreover, they not being coordinate officers; nor of a coordinate calling: neither having authority to put into office; cannot be proper judges of his offi|cial character, nor put out of office, according to the very words of the Platform. Chap. viii. "to con&s;ti|tute in office, and remove from office; are acts belong|ing to the &s;ame power."</P>
<P>But a Council of other Churches properly introduc|ed, and regularly hearing and judging upon the cau&s;e, and finding him <HI>incorrigibly offending;</HI> and <HI>directing to a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> The Church hath then <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>Yet even then, if the Church will not di&s;mi&s;s, will not con&s;ent to give up their Covenant with him, he is not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; the Council cannot de&s;troy the Cove|nant. The right of covenanting contracting parties mu&s;t forever remain &s;acred to the parties who made the covenant, contract or confederation. Yet howev|er they cannot be con&s;idered in Fellow&s;hip with oth|er Churches &s;o long as they remain &s;o, until &s;uch ad|vice is conformed to: or, as Mr. Wi&s;e &s;ays, is repeal|ed by a like power which made it.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear Friend, in compliance with your de&s;ire, in the cour&s;e of my letters, given you my idea of CONGREGATIONALISM: have endeavoured to wipe off the reproach, and obviate the ab&s;urdities which
<PB N="86" REF="026757_0085_0FD1C306CB6AD230">
many have loaded it with, by their fooli&s;h &s;entiments and wicked practices, which they have audaciou&s;ly a&s;|&s;cribed to it.</P>
<P>That IT may be rightly under&s;tood and carefully practi&s;ed by our CHURCHES,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Is the fervent wi&s;h of one Who is, Sir,
With &s;entiments of cordiality, Your humble Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
