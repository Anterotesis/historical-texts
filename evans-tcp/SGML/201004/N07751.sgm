<P>FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_PERFECT obedience to the mo&s;t holy law, is the fixed medium of ac|ceptance with its author. And the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch obedience, in tho&s;e who are any way chargeable with &s;in, made the nece&s;&s;ity of CHRIST'S appea|rance in human nature, for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch obe|dience, as well as &s;acrifice; that GOD might be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of them who believe in JESUS. But as man was originally formed for &s;uch obedience in him&s;elf, his pride &s;till &s;timulates him that way; and though, in re&s;pect of his original abilities, he is become like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, he &s;till tru&s;ts in him&s;elf that he is righteous. This was the &s;pirit of tho&s;e to whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, "by the deeds of the law, there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight." And again, "a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law&punc; but by the faith of JESUS CHRIST." On
<PB N="4" REF="009895_0003_0F7AD329F51AA678">
which he &s;oon &s;ucceeded to convince the <HI>Galatian</HI> churches, and in their turn the <HI>Roman</HI> too. But this method of acceptance with GOD not being natural, they made no long &s;tand in the &s;implicity of its pro|fe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that when St. <HI>James</HI> came to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame de&s;ign, he found the word among them was, "Do ye believe?&mdash;Do ye own the faith of CHRIST?" And who&s;oever made an affirmative an&s;wer, was a good chri&s;tian, without regard to the di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities of his faith, or its influence on heart or life. So they were generally believers, and as generally carele&s;s, ungodly livers. To them, in this light, St. <HI>James</HI> cries out, <HI>"Can faith &s;ave you?&mdash;Faith with|out works is dead."</HI>&mdash;"This is not the &s;ort of faith which <HI>Paul</HI> taught, but another, a counterfeit, a dead &s;ort." So that the&s;e two apo&s;tles &s;peak of diffe|rent things, and not contradictorily of the &s;ame thing. St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of true faith, St. <HI>James</HI> of a counter|feit and mo&s;t dangerous &s;ort of faith to be depended on. The former denies works to be the ground of a &s;inner's ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of GOD. The lat|ter requires them as the &s;aint's vindication of his profe&s;&s;ion in the &s;ight of men. One &s;ays, the &s;inner's works can't &s;ave him; the other &s;ays, the &s;aint's works mu&s;t prove him to be what he pretends. St. <HI>James</HI> found the chri&s;tians of his time made high pre|ten&s;ions to faith, and actually had a great deal of what they called by that name; yet, &s;ays he to them, ye may know 'tis a counterfeit &s;ort by your unevan|gelical tempers and lives; whereas if your faith was right, its fruits would ju&s;tify it; &s;uch a &s;ight of di|vine righteou&s;ne&s;s and grace would be imported in it, as could not fail to &s;hew your own vilene&s;s, and &s;o take away the occa&s;ion of pride, and make you deeply hum|ble. It would al&s;o give &s;uch &s;ight of the purity of the
<PB N="5" REF="009895_0004_0F7AD5061BDE8D50">
divine nature and law, as would transform your &s;pi|rits into the likene&s;s of GOD, and make you holy, like his mo&s;t holy law; whereas the faith you have, leaves you earthly, carnal, vain. The effect which a man's faith has upon his temper and life, proves what &s;ort it is. Ye &s;ee, therefore, &s;ays he, "how that by works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only." That is, not by being able to &s;ay that he believes, for that is not the evidence of true faith, nor will ju&s;tify any one's preten&s;ions to it; the devils can with great truth &s;ay they believe. When there is nothing but belief, in a man's religion, no <HI>divine truth,</HI> or genuine virtue of its &s;pirit; and &s;o no transforming effect, no holy fruits, 'tis thereby determined to be delu&s;ive. If faith be without works 'tis dead. All this is as true now, as it was in St. <HI>James</HI>'s time. That faith which of its own nature makes a humble, &s;elf-loathing, &s;elf-denying, and of cour&s;e a grace-ex|alting bent of mind, and &s;o a life evidently bearing the heavenly impre&s;s, is as &s;urely &s;aving, as the word of GOD is true; and the want of the&s;e in any one's belief, as evidently proves the contrary. This, me|thinks, might give &s;urprize to many, and make them each begin to &s;ay,
<Q>the LORD have mercy upon me! What &s;hall I do? I &s;ee I have faith plenty, I believe all things, in general, which the bible teaches; but alas! I don't find it affects my heart or life much. I am proud, vain, worldly, pa&s;&s;ionate, negligent of duties, yet believe all the time; I fear my faith is dead, and that I am de|ceived in my religion to this very day. My life certainly &s;tares again&s;t me; I don't find my faith is humble and &s;anctifying. I can have it as well in a carele&s;s way, as any; and don't this look like dead faith indeed? I don't find peace toward GOD;
<PB REF="009895_0005_0F7AD50764216B90">
&s;omething within tells me I am not right; am I not yet in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and under the bonds of iniquity, without GOD, without CHRIST, and without hope in the world! And &s;o have been every moment of my pa&s;t life in immediate danger of eternal burnings, having never had one thing about me, with which GOD is plea&s;ed; always deceiving my&s;elf with this notional faith.</Q></P>
<P>BUT perhaps all this is only &s;urprize, and you are not yet convinced that your faith is fal&s;e, and &s;o damning in&s;tead of &s;aving. Perhaps you don't &s;ee that your belief is e&s;&s;entially defective; but rather that it might do, if you had more of it, or if you had lived more agreeably. Perhaps you don't &s;ee, that, as readily as you have entertained the faith you have, you are thoroughly aver&s;e to that which is divine; and that true faith never begins with any thing le&s;s than omnipotence; and that GOD never be&s;tows it, but on &s;uch as have wholly lo&s;t &s;ight of all ability and goodne&s;s in them&s;elves. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, how great the dangerous and growing di&s;tance between your &s;oul and &s;aving faith to this day? And what rea&s;on have tho&s;e who can pray to cry out and &s;ay, <Q>O thou GOD of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h! who &s;ee&s;t and judge&s;t the &s;ecrets of all hearts; who know|e&s;t, perfectly knowe&s;t, the inward &s;tate of every &s;oul here, and what &s;ort of faith we are ri&s;king our eternity upon; be plea&s;ed, for the &s;ake of that per|fect atonement, to &s;hine in the&s;e dark &s;ouls this day, to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, as it appears to faith, in the face of JESUS CHRIST. And &s;uffer no proud, &s;elf-righ|teous delu&s;ion to prevent genuine conviction and light, by the plain account of true and fal&s;e faith which may now be exhibited. And as every heart
<PB N="7" REF="009895_0006_0F7AD507BB6133D0">
is naturally bent again&s;t it, with all its might, 'till conquered by mere power of truth, &s;o let thy power now be glorious in its going forth from conquering to conquer, 'till every heart of thy cho&s;en &s;hall bow to this only faith of the great Redeemer, <HI>Amen.</HI></Q>
Let us now attend to the fol|lowing di&s;tinctions between true and fal&s;e faith, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. True faith commences at the very time when the &s;inner fir&s;t finds all his &s;oul needs, in the bible's account of JESUS CHRIST, neither &s;ooner nor later; but a dead faith never commences at that time.</P>
<P N="2">II. True faith always affects the mind in a manner an&s;werable to the nature of its objects; a dead faith never.</P>
<P N="3">III. True faith produces ju&s;t &s;uch effects, as the &s;criptures a&s;cribe to true faith; but a dead faith pro|duces none of them. It has no &s;ort of divine influ|ence at all.</P>
<P N="1">I. TRUE faith then begins when CHRIST with his own truth, and glorious &s;ufficiency is fir&s;t made known to the &s;inner. By which it will appear that dead faith has no &s;uch commencement. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;hall &s;hew that there is an ab&s;olute and univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity for CHRIST to be &s;pecially made known to a per&s;on in order to his &s;alvation. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT this mu&s;t be by faith, or in believing the go&s;pel, and that there is no other way for a &s;inner to be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="3">3. SHALL give &s;ome account of the manner in which &s;uch faith is wrought.&mdash;Which will &s;hew the nature and work of faith in the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, and that it is peculiar to divine faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a revelation of CHRIST to the &s;inner for his &s;alvation. Now if
<PB N="8" REF="009895_0007_0F7AD5086EF11700">
we are not well a&s;&s;ured of this nece&s;&s;ity, the doctrine of faith, as the alone mean of ju&s;tification, will be to us as the doctrine of the cro&s;s was of old, to &s;ome a &s;tumbling block, to others fooli&s;h. Not being con|vinced of our moral ruin is the grand rea&s;on why the doctrine of faith as taught in the &s;criptures, is &s;o little regarded; they who are whole need not the phy&s;ician. Let us take then a hint or two of evi|dence, that this ruin is ours.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IF death reigned from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that is, for two thou&s;and five hundred years, over &s;uch as never committed one actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; then hu|man nature mu&s;t be in a fallen guilty &s;tate; but death did &s;o reign.&mdash;<HI>Rom.</HI> v. 14. Now death is the greate&s;t puni&s;hment that ever was inflicted; &s;uch puni&s;hment tho&s;e &s;ubjects de&s;erved, if GOD is righ|teous in all his executions; but as they had com|mitted no actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, how could they de&s;erve it, unle&s;s by an univer&s;ally corrupted and ruined nature! And yet that &s;ame puni&s;hment hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, becau&s;e all men, in that &s;ame &s;en&s;e, have &s;inned. There is therefore no way or name under heaven, given among men, by which they may be &s;aved, but that of JESUS of <HI>Nazareth, Acts.</HI> iv. 10, 12. Nor any &s;alvation by him, but through faith, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8. 'Tis no eva&s;ion of this argument to &s;ay it was only bodily death that &s;o reigned as the apo&s;tle &s;ays; becau&s;e death of the body is great puni&s;hment, and &s;o the argument is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> 'tis incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of GOD and his government to puni&s;h tho&s;e who are not guilty.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) If we have all a natural freedom to &s;in, but no &s;uch natural freedom to be holy and heavenly; then our natures are &s;inful and not holy. This is evident to common &s;en&s;e. But nothing that worketh abomi|nation
<PB N="9" REF="009895_0008_0F7AD5090AC7AC90">
or maketh a lie, can, as &s;uch, enter heaven, nor can we be renewed from &s;uch &s;tate, but through faith.&mdash;Therefore, he that believeth, &s;hall be &s;aved, and he who believeth not &s;hall be damned, <HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 16.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) IF one died for all, then were all dead, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14. Now though the <HI>all</HI> for whom CHRIST died, is to be under&s;tood in the mo&s;t re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, for the elect only; it will doubtle&s;s be allowed that they are not naturally in a wor&s;e &s;tate than the non-elect; but then the con&s;equence is, all are as &s;urely dead in &s;in by nature, as that CHRIST died for any.&mdash;Only therefore in him who rai&s;eth the dead is there any po&s;&s;ible hope of &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE only way to be &s;aved by him, is through faith. Faith is believing GOD. Hence <HI>Abraham</HI>'s faith is thus de&s;cribed, (<HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 3)&mdash;'tis a believing the record which GOD has given of his &s;on,&mdash;1 <HI>John</HI> v. 10, 11. True faith is &s;uch a belief as makes its ob|jects, pre&s;ent and certain realities in the mind; ju&s;t as it is in believing a common fact,&mdash;<HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 1. Of con&s;equence, a believer is one who is affected with divine things, ju&s;t as if they were pre&s;ent realities, even as a common fact affects us as a common truth, when we believe it; and by this he &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from all &s;ubjects of counterfeit faith in the world, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 10. Now we mu&s;t be &s;aved through &s;uch faith only, or by our own goodne&s;s altogether, or partly by both. But,</P>
<P N="1">1. Not by our own goodne&s;s altogether; for if we were without &s;in at all, and our obedience was quite perfect, we could merit nothing, 'tis all already due; what can we then do, now that we are altogether &s;inful? Nay, our utmo&s;t can't begin to an&s;wer the native demands of the mo&s;t holy law, becau&s;e they
<PB N="10" REF="009895_0009_0F7AD50A68C43010">
are all perfect, and we are &s;o in nothing. And if we can't begin, what can we do? Be&s;ide, no per&s;on in the world is naturally willing to be holy, "the carnal mind is <HI>enmity</HI> again&s;t GOD, not &s;ubject to his law, nor indeed can be;" (<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7)&mdash;and if not willing, if emnity in the ab&s;tract, what can we do? Truly nothing at all.&mdash;Therefore, cur&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in man, him&s;elf, or any other, 2. We can|not be &s;aved partly by both; fir&s;t, becau&s;e we have no &s;uch goodne&s;s, as has been &s;hewn; and al&s;o be|cau&s;e no part of the glory of his grace, will CHRIST divide to another; (<HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlii. 7, 8)&mdash;therefore,&mdash;3. We are &s;hut up to faith, to mere believing in the &s;en&s;e above de&s;cribed, for ju&s;tification and acceptance with GOD. But now the que&s;tion is, have we got this only &s;aving precious faith? He who has, is now in a &s;tate of acceptance with GOD, and &s;hall be found in CHRIST without &s;pot and blamele&s;s.&mdash;But he who has not this only &s;aving faith, is yet in his &s;ins; all his life's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are now lying again&s;t him in the book of GOD. What a dreadful catalogue fills out the long pages of that mo&s;t voluminous record! Such as dare to trifle with clean&s;ing blood, and free mercy, 'till righteou&s;ne&s;s terminates divine patience, will there find a long detail of crimes beyond their expectation! Sins of childhood, youth and riper years; of heart and lip and life; &s;ecret iniquities, which they thought no eye beheld; tho&s;e which have galled their con|&s;cience, and they well remember; al&s;o thou&s;ands which (&s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee) they thought long &s;ince forgot; millions more, which they hoped would be excu&s;ed.&mdash;Nay, whole &s;heets are filled with their re|ligious duties; not becau&s;e they did them, but be|cau&s;e profanely or proudly done. And the blacke&s;t charge of all is,
<Q>ye would not come to me, that
<PB N="11" REF="009895_0010_0F7AD50B1E86B668">
ye might have life.</Q>
There is tru&s;ting to fal&s;e hopes, &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and duties; crucifying CHRIST, de&s;pi&s;ing the blood of the covenant; &s;ab|baths and &s;ermons trifled away; means and mercies always abu&s;ed. Providence, word and &s;pirit all pro|faned; &s;un and moon, hou&s;e and friends, bed and board, life and health all abu&s;ed to divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures. And when they &s;ee hell &s;ubjoined to every page, and burning flames to every line, and no re|deemer there, what will they do? The word of GOD condemns them; the perfect knowledge of the judge condemns them; and con&s;cience from within, echoes truth to every charge. The&s;e are the three books by which the world is judged, and which for that purpo&s;e <HI>John</HI> &s;aw opened in the judgment. And when &s;inners, long called to faith by a kind redeemer, come to &s;ee the&s;e three records of divine authority, opened before them, they will turn their own accu&s;ers, and each amazed, begin to &s;ay,
<Q>Oh &s;tupid wretch that I was! Oh hardened rebel to this dreadful GOD! How long he called me, but I &s;till refu&s;ed! He warned, he waited, but I would not hear. Long time his bowels yearned, for he &s;aw my &s;tate, he &s;aw my danger, and this final day a coming. Indeed he told me all about it, but I cho&s;e my own delu&s;ions, was plea&s;ed with &s;in, and would not for|&s;ake it. I know he offered pardon if I would be|lieve; he bid me tru&s;t his mercy, and I &s;hould be &s;aved. But here, this heart held fa&s;t its idols, and would not let them go; yet hoped for heaven, dreaming of faith, of duties, and of &s;ins forgiven. And now my time is gone, the door is &s;hut, and he who&s;e mercies I have abu&s;ed, is now my judge, my dreadful avenger; no hope remains, there's no e&s;cape; his eye &s;ees through me, and his guards are
<PB N="12" REF="009895_0011_0F7AD50C0B485228">
round me! The thunder ri&s;es! Torment increa&s;es! My &s;oul is &s;inking in the gulph of vengeance forever and ever!</Q>
There are they who de&s;pi&s;ed the go&s;pel, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;aviour; were bid believe his truth, and tru&s;t his grace, but never did; were often warned of certain ruin in every other way, but &s;till would give ear to lying vanities; they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> lie in chains, mu&s;t burn in hell forever and ever. More ages than this world has &s;tood, won't bring relief. Their old heart re|mains, they have the &s;ame lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame ta&s;te and aver&s;ions, which always governed them; yea, they are incen&s;ed and increa&s;ed, old re&s;traints are taken off, and re&s;tle&s;s fury burns within; felt di&s;ap|pointment, and black di&s;pair inflames and rages all their powers; and the&s;e by di&s;tortion always grow|ing, mu&s;t from nature and ju&s;tice make that hell eter|nal.</P>
<P>NOTHING le&s;s than all this, is the certain con&s;e|quence of delu&s;ion in point of faith:&mdash;For GOD will bring every thing into judgment; and "he that be|lieveth not &s;hall be damned." This &s;hould excite the grand inquiry,&mdash;how &s;hall I become acquainted with true faith? Or, how &s;hall we know whether our faith is living or dead faith? Which brings me to,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE third thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To give &s;ome account of a &s;aving change as wrought in the &s;inner's heart; which will &s;hew that it is peculiar to divine faith. Here we &s;hould &s;peak,&mdash;1. Of the &s;inner's be|ing brought down from his towering hopes of accep|tance with GOD, by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, to &s;ee him|&s;elf as he is, in order that mere mercy might have all the honor of his &s;alvation. We have already &s;hewn that all are naturally dead in &s;in; in which &s;tate, they are either &s;o &s;tupid as not to apprehend danger, or &s;o far blinded with their notions of goodne&s;s in
<PB N="13" REF="009895_0012_0F7AD50CCA1A49D8">
them&s;elves, as to hope for deliverance thereby.&mdash;They are either hardened to ea&s;e in <HI>Zion,</HI> or are rich and in|crea&s;ed in goods, and &s;o have need of nothing; though in fact they are wretched and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind and naked; not a moment's peace of con|&s;cience; always under wrath.&mdash;Know nothing of the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t, or of communion with GOD, nor ta&s;te any &s;weets in holy religion.&mdash;Their hearts are plea&s;ed with &s;in, but cordially delight in nothing that is divine.&mdash;And though they are always unhappy, their hearts being like the troubled &s;ea, never at re&s;t, knowing nothing of the nature of peace; yet they have a &s;trange &s;ort of ea&s;ine&s;s, and fro&s;t-bit|ten plea&s;ure.&mdash;They make them&s;elves &s;ecure, by a guard again&s;t thoughts of GOD, religion, and death; they make them&s;elves hope things will end well, by fal&s;e notions of GOD, and of their own goodne&s;s. In &s;uch like manner men lead their lives, not one per&s;on exempt, of any &s;ort, 'till, it may be, GOD is plea&s;ed to alarm one, and that none of the be&s;t; for publicans and harlots &s;hall go into the kingdom of heaven be|fore tho&s;e who think well of them&s;elves. The means of this alarm are the words of GOD, with their in&s;epa|rable attendants the Holy Gho&s;t. The occa&s;ion may be taken from death, &s;ickne&s;s, word read or preached, &s;ignal providence, or dictate of con&s;cience; but the power of GOD is not re&s;trained to all the&s;e, he may &s;eize a per&s;on in the mid&s;t of his career, as <HI>Saul</HI> go|ing pro&s;perou&s;ly to <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> Often the effect of this alarm, is only reformation of known &s;ins, or &s;et|ting up the practice of &s;ome known duty. And this naturally becomes a new ground of pride and &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s; for the &s;inner knowing no better ground of tru&s;t, always puts importance upon what he thinks good in him&s;elf; here therefore many, doubtle&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="009895_0013_0F7AD50E2423FBD0">
very many, &s;it down, and here they die. But the &s;criptures, which are our grand rule in the&s;e matters, a&s;&s;ures us, not only that GOD can, but that he often does, with little or no di&s;tinction of time, give the &s;inner his killing wound, and his healing grace; for 'tis all the &s;ame with him, to &s;ay, "I kill, and I make alive," or to do the work. This was illu&s;|trated in the forementioned ca&s;e of <HI>Saul;</HI> the woman of <HI>Samaria;</HI> the thief on the cro&s;s, and others; and was repre&s;ented in the re&s;urrection of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and other like in&s;tances. But a &s;tate of &s;in, guilt, death and wrath, mu&s;t be &s;een and felt, for the whole need not a phy&s;ician; and CHRIST came only to &s;ave &s;uch as are lo&s;t, and to none can he be precious but tho&s;e who feel that character. This was the ca&s;e of the convinced jailor, and the thou&s;ands at <HI>Peter</HI>'s &s;er|mon, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 37.&mdash;Some are by light of truth com|pelled to come forth &s;ooner, others later.&mdash;Some go along kicking again&s;t the pricks, re&s;i&s;ting light and conviction. 'Tis a metaphor taken from a dull ox, who will rather kick again&s;t the pointed goad, than yield to work, and quicken his pace; though by trying to repel the goad, he only hurts him&s;elf the more. Convictions make no alteration in the &s;inners moral &s;tate, no more than a per&s;on's continuing to feel pain in the ri&s;ing of a di&s;temper, cures it. They are the &s;inner's &s;ight of him&s;elf, and when he is brought to &s;ee him&s;elf compleatly fit for immediate damnation, free grace will be glorious, if he is de|livered; for the excellency of the power will be ma|nife&s;t to be of GOD. And 'till this is the ca&s;e, be it &s;ooner or later, delivering grace will not appear. But when the &s;inner is brought to &s;ee him&s;elf lo&s;t, two things remarkably take place. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His old excu&s;es, in which he u&s;ed to per&s;uade

him&s;elf there was &s;ome rea&s;on, now appear to be willing, di&s;contented eva&s;ions of known truth and duty, and &s;o greatly enhance his guilt. The&s;e fig leaves, not only will not cover him, but he &s;ees him|&s;elf, by &s;o much the more expo&s;ed to wrath for them; they are now numbered among his great iniquities, and &s;erve eminently to condemn him, as evidence in fact of the pride and enmity of his whole heart again&s;t the truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. His duties and good qualifications, as a rea|&s;on of hope, totally di&s;appear. Before his convic|tions, yea always 'till now, he thought there were &s;ome good things about him, which kept his &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit alive, and which &s;hewed it&s;elf. 1. By an habitual conceit that GOD intended to be merciful to him. 2. By a turn of mind again&s;t tho&s;e who did not think well of his moral &s;tate; and con&s;equently by a di&s;po&s;ition to care&s;s tho&s;e who flattered his hopes. 3. By his habit of thinking there were &s;ome wor&s;e in the &s;ight of GOD than him&s;elf. 4. By his inward di&s;affection to di&s;cour&s;es or books which &s;trenuou&s;ly excluded <HI>all works</HI> in ju&s;tification; and his real plea|&s;ure when &s;ome con&s;ideration for them was a&s;&s;erted. 5. By his thinking it hard that &s;uch as he &s;hould be doomed to eternal hell.&mdash;But now he views him&s;elf as a &s;inner, a hearty helple&s;s &s;inner, his con&s;cience and the law te&s;tify of a righteous judge, but he &s;ees no beauty in him that he &s;hould be de&s;ired; for in this, tho&s;e views of GOD which legal fear gives, are e&s;&s;entially different from tho&s;e of faith and love. By the former he is viewed as an avenger, by the other as a father and a friend. One keeps the &s;oul under &s;lavi&s;h principles, and &s;huts out love; the other brings the &s;oul in &s;ight of rich favour, and ca&s;ts out &s;lavi&s;h fear. Of con&s;equence, the former forbids

delight and plea&s;ure in any duty or &s;ervice of religion; the latter feels the ways of wi&s;dom all-plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>THE &s;inner thus come to him&s;elf, but not to GOD, to whom he never &s;aw him&s;elf farther off than now, finds, in oppo&s;ition to all his former imaginations, that what he needs is a new heart to be created in him, and another, a right &s;pirit to be put within him; and he finds 'tis equally unattainable by him as to create a world out of nothing; for he knows he has no ability or fitne&s;s for the work.&mdash;He is totally blind, to all the things of the &s;pirit of GOD, he don't &s;ee or feel things as the bible repre&s;ents them; don't hate &s;in for its nature, but for its puni&s;hment; don't love religion for its excellency, but only for the &s;afe|ty it gives hope of.&mdash;He &s;ees he don't venture his <HI>all</HI> on the merit of CHRIST alone, or tru&s;t his truth; <HI>he has no faith.</HI>&mdash;He can't tru&s;t the word of a GOD, he has tried every mean for it all in vain; he is as full of pride and unbelief as ever, and his &s;in, guilt, and condemnation increa&s;ing by all he thinks and all he does.&mdash;Which introduces the following things, and in the following order, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;1. That the wound of his ca&s;e is, he is wholly de&s;titute of the fir&s;t princi|ples of holine&s;s. This &s;hews why his heart will not yield to GOD, 'tis becau&s;e there is no principle or &s;pring of right action there. He &s;ees now why his duties could not help him, becau&s;e they mu&s;t be like him&s;elf, as wide from morally right, as unlike GOD, and the commanding law, as he him&s;elf is. Ju&s;t &s;o, he &s;ees, of cour&s;e, is the utmo&s;t he can do; and &s;o he finds 'tis not in man to direct his &s;teps; now he learns the mournful truth, "thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy|&s;elf." A clear conviction of this, will naturally, 2. Introduce a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms in his oppo&s;ing, quarrelling heart. The &s;inner naturally practi&s;ed his

oppo&s;ition by a living di&s;obedience to the whole re|vealed will of GOD; and now &s;ince his convictions, his oppo&s;ition has been e&s;pecially pointed again&s;t faith, as the only means of ju&s;tification; he has &s;hewed his enmity by refu&s;ing to tru&s;t his polluted &s;oul, his guilty con&s;cience in the hand of CHRIST for pardon and clean&s;ing. CHRIST has bidden the &s;inner to come to him, with all his &s;in and guilt, and he &s;hould be delivered; but the &s;inner has &s;aid, it will not do, he won't accept me 'till I mend a little; I mu&s;t get rid of &s;ome &s;ins fir&s;t, and get &s;ome more goodne&s;s in my heart; &s;o he has indulged his enmity again&s;t the way of &s;alvation by faith alone. And be|cau&s;e he could not get deliverance in his own way, he thought hard of GOD, of the go&s;pel, of all who would not encourage him in his way of acceptance; and would not be plea&s;ed with the way of life, as concerted by the wi&s;dom of GOD. But now, &s;ince he &s;ees his heart, and all its propen&s;ities are tho|roughly perver&s;e, and all its &s;chemes for acceptance ju&s;t like it&s;elf, all directly contrary to GOD and his way, and as &s;uch, the very height of iniquity; he &s;ays,
<Q>No wonder GOD has not accepted me! I thought there was &s;ome rea&s;on and goodne&s;s in my duties, and &s;chemes for acceptance, but I &s;ee, I am convinced, 'tis quite otherwi&s;e; I am all &s;inner, and all that's mine, is like my&s;elf; no wonder GOD could not regard any thing I did! Now I &s;ee "they that are in the fle&s;h <HI>cannot</HI> plea&s;e GOD." This is my ca&s;e, he and I are <HI>contrary</HI> the one to the other.

wrangled again&s;t him, and all his ways, but e&s;pe|cially his way of &s;aving &s;inners as written in the bible. But now I &s;ee the rea&s;on of all my mi&s;ery is from my willing &s;elf.&mdash;3. Therefore nothing can be more ju&s;t than eternal de&s;truction to my &s;oul; not one thing done in heaven righter than this; the &s;entence in its dreadful weight is ju&s;t as right as GOD is right; for the&s;e things were all revealed to me in the word of GOD, and made exceeding plain; but I have gone all my life directly again&s;t their te&s;timony. I have &s;inned willingly, know|ingly, allowedly again&s;t light, knowledge, warn|ings, love, and mercies. Such mea&s;ures I have con&s;ented to, and been plea&s;ed with; of cour&s;e, the con&s;equent puni&s;hment is my own, and GOD is ju&s;t. If, according to his word, he dooms me now to eternal burnings, that ble&s;&s;ed world, my guilty &s;oul, and all creation mu&s;t applaud it ju&s;t.</Q>
The &s;inner don't hereby con&s;ent to his own damna|tion, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, but is convinced of perfect rea&s;on in the cur&s;e of the law, and of perfect ju&s;tice if it &s;hould be executed.</P>
<P>NOW if mercy is di&s;played, in a revelation of CHRIST, in his own grace and perfect &s;ufficiency, to the &s;inner's actual apprehen&s;ion; and &s;o he &s;hould be changed into the &s;ame image, the excellency of this work would be <HI>manife&s;t to this per&s;on</HI> to be of GOD; con&s;equently all the prai&s;e mu&s;t evidently belong to him; which cannot be &s;ecured to the proper object in any other way. Now this is the grand de&s;ign of divine goodne&s;s by the go&s;pel, to &s;ecure happine&s;s to believing &s;inners, and <HI>all</HI> the glory to &s;overeign grace.&mdash;Wherefore, when the &s;inner is brought to the&s;e views of him&s;elf, as <HI>all-&s;inner,</HI> and GOD a righ|teous judge, then mercy in full con&s;i&s;tence with

Such is that regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t which the &s;criptures &s;peak of. Such is that receiving CHRIST by faith, or by &s;eeing and believing what he has done for &s;inners, wherein the work of GOD in the &s;inner's heart primarily con|&s;i&s;ts. At the in&s;tant of the &s;inner's thus &s;eeing truth and reality in what the bible &s;ays of CHRIST and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o finding relief in it equal to his ca&s;e, which is faith, he is ju&s;tified. And &s;o you have an account of the commencement of living faith, which from the nature of the ca&s;e mu&s;t exclude all other faith from any place in this affair. Such faith appears in every view to be right, by its univer&s;al corre&s;pondence to the bible, and an&s;wering all the intentions of divine faith.&mdash;Whereas every other faith leaves the &s;ubject de&s;titute of all the&s;e operations and powerful effects.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd rule of trial is, true faith always

affects the mind, in a manner an&s;werable to the na|ture of its objects; but &s;o dead faith never does. In a general manner, both the&s;e &s;orts of faith have the &s;ame objects. The true believer, and the de|ceived believer, can &s;ub&s;cribe the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion of faith; they both believe there is a GOD, a Redeemer, a Holy Gho&s;t, a bible of divine authority, a chri&s;tian &s;abbath, a nece&s;&s;ity of faith to ju&s;tification, a fu|ture judgment, and approaching eternity, but the point in que&s;tion is, which of the&s;e &s;orts of believers is &s;uitably affected by what he believes in the&s;e ca&s;es, by this the belief it&s;elf is determined to be genuine. For &s;ub&s;tance and &s;hadow are not more different, than the&s;e two notions of faith, according to <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 1.</P>
<P>HERE we &s;hould de&s;cend to particulars; but will it be to any purpo&s;e? 'Tis to be concluded, that a number here are now re&s;ting on dead faith; and that this is far the greate&s;t number, perhaps ten to one; probably much more. And this &s;ort are &s;o generally &s;ecure, and in their own opinion &s;afe, that there is little rea&s;on to expect a fair hearing, e&s;pecially in an affair &s;o di&s;agreeable as trials of the truth of faith. However the power of GOD makes u&s;e of hearing for the purpo&s;e of begetting faith, (as nature does in com|mon ca&s;es;) and po&s;&s;ibly con&s;cience may have begun already to di&s;turb &s;ome of you. Are there not &s;ome here, perhaps of the loo&s;er &s;ort who&s;e wicked lives have &s;hocked and weakened the &s;trength of their hopes; or who&s;e con&s;ciences have had more influence again&s;t the &s;tupifying tendency of dead faith; who have had &s;ome &s;ecret mi&s;givings at what was &s;poken of the &s;inners lo&s;t e&s;tate, his convictions, or his &s;aving change? Did not your con&s;cience, my hearer, tell you,
<Q>thou ha&s;t never known that, nor that;

thou ha&s;t never &s;een things &s;o; never felt &s;uch a change? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>&mdash;May that divine mercy; that open fountain, which takes motive only from it&s;elf, accompany the following illu&s;trations with conquering light to your &s;ouls, as well as &s;weet confirmation to every humble &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. BOTH the&s;e &s;orts of faith profe&s;s to agree, there is a GOD: A being of all perfection, who can do all things, and is worthy of all reverence and obedience, and who&s;e eyes are in every place beholding the evil and the good. Now the que&s;tion is, how does our faith of this divine exi&s;tence affect us? Natural con|&s;cience will &s;ay, &s;urely the belief of &s;uch a being &s;hould &s;olemnize the heart, make it not only afraid of &s;in, but endear all his will, and humble the &s;oul to habitual reverence and univer&s;al obedience. And the lan|guage of &s;cripture is,
<Q>Let all the earth fear the LORD, and all the inhabitants of the world &s;tand in awe of him," <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxxiii. 8&mdash;And <HI>Prov.</HI> iii. 5, 6, Tru&s;t in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not to thine own under&s;tanding.&mdash;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct thy paths.</Q>
Here let the con&s;cience of every per&s;on &s;peak, does your faith of GOD <HI>&s;o</HI> influence and govern your heart, and life? What &s;ays con&s;cience? Or do you find that in &s;pite of all your belief about GOD, his power and pre&s;ence, your heart will have its way? Will be &s;tupid, vain and trifling, roving after &s;en&s;ual ob|jects, cold and wandering in the mo&s;t &s;acred employ|ments? How then does your faith affect your heart in a manner an&s;werable to the nature of its object? The object of your faith now, is the perfections and pre&s;ence of Jehovah, but your heart is ju&s;t as it was, or would be without &s;uch belief; no commanding &s;olemnity upon it; you can have all your common
<PB N="22" REF="009895_0021_0F7AD5138B9316C8">
thoughts of GOD, without any effect at all upon your heart. Are not the&s;e the &s;peaking lineaments of dead faith? Now living faith of this object, purifies the heart, clean&s;es from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and enables to perfect holine&s;s in the fear of GOD, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 1. There is joy and peace in believing. He who has not the&s;e effects, has a dead faith, 'tis not the very &s;ub&s;tantiating evidence of its object as true faith is, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. BOTH &s;orts of believers &s;ay, that JESUS CHRIST is the only &s;aviour. Dead faith yields a &s;ort of a&s;&s;ent to all the &s;criptures &s;ay about CHRIST, and may fol|low him for the loaves, <HI>i. e.</HI> for &s;ome worldly or &s;el|fi&s;h advantage; it would be thought to believe his &s;ufficiency, &s;uitablene&s;s and excellency, yea, it may call him the chief of ten thou&s;ands, and altogether lovely; but they are empty words; for it neither tru&s;ts his &s;ufficiency, nor is plea&s;ed with his &s;uitable|ne&s;s, nor loves his excellency. When a fal&s;e believer goes to his GOD, the medium of his acce&s;s is always the goodne&s;s of his heart or life, pa&s;t duties, earne&s;t|ne&s;s, hone&s;ty, the pityablene&s;s of his ca&s;e, or &s;ome other per&s;onal qualification, but never CHRIST'S merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s alone. But a chri&s;tian be|lieves, and &s;o is governed according to the &s;cripture account of that only &s;aviour. Does he &s;ave his peo|ple from their &s;ins,&mdash;he who believes it repairs to him with all his guilty burdens for relief. Is CHRIST'S righ|teou&s;ne&s;s the only medium of acce&s;s to GOD, and accep|tance with him, living faith enables to rely on <HI>that,</HI> ex|clu&s;ive of all other placating con&s;iderations. If CHRIST executes the great offices of king, prie&s;t and prophet, divine faith looks to the fir&s;t for all acts of power and &s;overeign dominion, both to &s;ubdue and de&s;troy all its enemies, looks to, and depends on the &s;econd,
<PB N="23" REF="009895_0022_0F7AD514C0C301E0">
for all pardon and clean&s;ing; and on the la&s;t, for all light and teaching. Faith derives all its &s;in-&s;ubdu|ing, heart-purifying, &s;oul-enlightening virtues from the &s;ame CHRIST whom it believes to be exalted for that very purpo&s;e. As a chri&s;tian believes him to be the chief of ten thou&s;ands, he treats him accordingly, by &s;upreme affection, and all-governing regard. In|deed, choice and delight attend divine faith, in all its exerci&s;es towards its numberle&s;s divine objects: "Faith works by love." Are they, like the fir&s;t and chief of them, all pure; then faith purifies the heart. Is CHRIST the LORD &s;trong and mighty, faith takes &s;anctuary in all dangers, from all its adver&s;aries, in him. As faith &s;ees the will of GOD is our &s;anctifica|tion, &s;o it &s;ets the LORD, and his illu&s;trious examples, before our eyes, and makes the &s;oul ardent, by every means, after holine&s;s. CHRIST is "the way" from all evil, to all good, accordingly he who believes it can rid him&s;elf of no &s;in, of no penal evil, but by him; can obtain no inward ble&s;&s;ing or outward re|lief but by him. CHRIST is "the truth" of all he pretended, of all ancient types and prophecies, and of all the &s;oul needs; accordingly faith tru&s;ts him without re&s;erve, &s;ees him in the long train of <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> types, and in all the prophets, and goes to him boldly with all its wants. In &s;hort, to them who believe he is precious, and &s;o true faith &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from every counterfeit. "The life" that is in CHRIST gives being to faith, and all it does, wherein con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t emphatically its e&s;&s;ential difference from every other notion of faith.</P>

He fancies him&s;elf to be taught by the word of GOD, which never gives di|vine knowledge, but as the Holy Gho&s;t invigorates it for that purpo&s;e, and without which that &s;pirit does never &s;o teach. He hopes, however, he has &s;ome &s;mall mea&s;ure of the &s;pirit, (and &s;mall mea&s;ures will &s;erve them who de&s;ire none) becau&s;e he is &s;ober, performs duties, and has &s;ome concern about his &s;oul; and e&s;pecially if providence &s;miles upon him, and he has &s;ome unexpected deliverance, and pro&s;perity, then he hopes this un&s;een ble&s;&s;ing is &s;omewhere about him; and he is much ea&s;ier with the&s;e deluded &s;up|po&s;itions than he would be if he really thought the Holy Gho&s;t was there.&mdash;Whereas true faith gives &s;en&s;e of impotence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s to every divine efficacy with him: Knows 'tis by the &s;pirit of GOD that all its works are wrought.

And the&s;e are not rare things, but matters of daily and hourly experience with a chri&s;|tian, and &s;o his faith affecting him an&s;werably to its object, determines it the only go&s;pel faith. But this is &s;uch a &s;ort of an affair, unnatural to mankind, that it may be a&s;ked, how &s;hall I know whether I have the Holy Gho&s;t dwelling in me, according to the promi&s;e of CHRIST, or not?</P>

This is the rea&s;on why multitudes, who if an earthly king, or even a natural father, &s;hould &s;peak, threaten, command or promi&s;e to them, they would receive impre&s;&s;ion an&s;werable to the thing &s;poken, and the authority of the &s;peaker; yet when they read or hear the bible, they have no an&s;werable effect, though they &s;ay 'tis the word of GOD to them; and &s;o the word, not being mixed with faith, never profits them. Their &s;ouls are not united to the truth they read, and &s;o never get the &s;incere milk of it for nouri&s;hment, but wither and die in the mid&s;t of go&s;pel plenty; ju&s;t as when the dige&s;tive powers of the &s;tomach are not employed on the food received, &s;o no nouri&s;hment, is &s;ecreted, the body mu&s;t pine and die. At the

&s;ame time living faith, viewing the holy book as a fountain of truth and light, the &s;oul derives actual nouri&s;hment, feels its quick and powerful virtues, and it proves to be <HI>the word of</HI> GOD, by working effec|tually in them that believe. But to &s;ee the di&s;tinc|tion, we &s;hould be a little more particular; and &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE are in the word of GOD, commands, both moral ones, founded in the nature of their ca&s;es, and enforced by divine authority; and po&s;itive ones, founded only in the will of GOD. Dead faith owns all this, but never affects the reader with any commanding &s;en&s;e of authority in the precept, or yielding &s;ubjection in his heart. Whereas by true faith the mind &s;ees authority and maje&s;ty, as well as rea&s;on and goodne&s;s in the command, and is bowed to unfeigned obedience, and &s;o the word of the LORD is powerful.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE are al&s;o in the word of GOD, promi&s;es, both ab&s;olute ones, without any condition, becau&s;e they contain the fir&s;t qualifications, and are therefore the only fountain for tho&s;e who have none; and con|ditional ones, which convey their goods to tho&s;e ac|tually furni&s;hed with their condition. An ungodly believer reads the&s;e as he does other &s;criptures, but has no &s;en&s;e of the rich trea&s;ures lodged in them, nor does his faith ever &s;eize upon them, and draw them out. He reads about the covenant of grace, which is compo&s;ed of the&s;e great and precious promi&s;es, but he regards it not as a &s;ummary of the loving-kindne&s;s of the LORD propo&s;ed to his &s;oul; nor does ever bow to its bands, or ta&s;te its &s;weete&s;t mercies. Whereas in all the&s;e is the life of true faith; and unle&s;s the&s;e gracious words of the covenant and its promi&s;es, with their divine certainty, had been the &s;oul's relief, it mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in many an adver&s;ity.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="27" REF="009895_0026_0F7AD517B916AF60">3. THERE are doctrines al&s;o, by which the man of GOD may be thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good work. To the&s;e true faith gives heed as to the in|&s;tructions of its GOD, its father, and its friend. By the&s;e a true believer is made light in the LORD, and wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. They are a light to his feet, and a lamp to all his paths.&mdash;But they are daily a &s;a|vour of death unto death to a dead believer. 'Tis with this &s;ort of people, as of old with <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the words of their peace are before their eyes, but the <HI>things</HI> of their peace, contained in tho&s;e words, are totally hidden from their eyes, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. 42.</P>
<P N="4">4. THERE are &s;tories, examples, and penalties in the word of GOD, by which the different &s;orts of pro|fe&s;&s;ors are very differently affected. Divine faith &s;ees the whole moral &s;y&s;tem acted out in the two former, as it were, in in&s;tances before its eyes; and &s;o &s;eeing the will of GOD illu&s;trated in them, is furni&s;hed with patterns for heart and life. It &s;ees in the&s;e &s;tories and examples &s;cripture promi&s;es made out in facts, to faith of its doctrines, and obedience of its commands; and the penalties as &s;urely executed on the want of both. But dead faith though it may be amu&s;ed and diverted by them, never takes the&s;e admonitions or gets &s;uch divine wi&s;dom from them. And the &s;crip|ture &s;tiles them fools, who though they have &s;o great a price in their hand, have no heart to improve it: &s;o the effect produced by faith determines its kind.</P>
<P N="5">5. THESE two &s;orts of faith agree in &s;ome &s;ort of a&s;&s;ent to the morality of the &s;abbath; that fixed me|morial of creation and redemption; that picture of &s;oul-re&s;t in CHRIST now, and of endle&s;s re&s;t with him in glory. Profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, in general, allow the whole day is the LORD'S; but dead faith is &s;o little affected with its divine de&s;ignation, that if intere&s;t

or humour calls, if plea&s;ing example, cu&s;tom, or company requires, in front of his belief, the profe&s;&s;or can infringe upon its borders, trifle with its obliga|tion, and &s;erve him&s;elf with it, in thought, if not al&s;o in word and deed. If he e&s;capes the civil la&s;h, and popular cen&s;ure, 'tis well enough; and yet affirms the &s;acred precepts about it, and the dreadful effects of its prophanation. Whereas belief of the holine&s;s of the &s;abbath, will di&s;po&s;e and bind the heart to be in temper, and practice ju&s;t what it is in profe&s;&s;ion. Both the&s;e &s;orts of profe&s;&s;ors read, and allow the di|vinity of that remarkable rule for &s;abbatizing in the fifty-eighth of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and two la&s;t ver&s;es; and one of them feels divinely bound to act it out &s;incerely; they of this &s;ort make a bu&s;ine&s;s of it, not in &s;hew only, but in &s;pirit, to keep holy the &s;abbath day. While the other never goes much further than ap|pearances, and often in them vi&s;ibly defective. Hence the wide difference &s;o evident among profe&s;&s;ors about &s;anctifying the &s;abbath.&mdash;And to their different mea|&s;ures very different con&s;equences corre&s;pond; the one &s;ort has acceptance with GOD, the other has none; the one has peace on this head, the other has none; one is a &s;weet &s;avour unto GOD, the other a &s;tench; becau&s;e to one &s;ort the &s;abbath is a wearine&s;s, and their hearts tired with its re&s;traints, &s;ay, "when will it be gone?" While the other does more than <HI>call</HI> it a de|light; 'tis to them "the holy of the LORD and ho|norable." And the&s;e employ the day, in every part, with a holy mind, and heavenly bu&s;ine&s;s; but the other are always de&s;titute of both. So the former are approved of GOD, their con&s;cience, and the law, while the latter are condemned of all. True faith is always operative, and influences &s;oul and life accord|ing to its objects; but other faith is not &s;o; and this makes the vi&s;ible difference among profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="29" REF="009895_0028_0F7AD51956EDA4E8">6. BOTH &s;orts affirm a nece&s;&s;ity of faith for ju&s;tifi|cation in the &s;ight of GOD, and a chri&s;tian both &s;ees what to believe for that purpo&s;e, and that there is nece&s;&s;ity of it; but the formali&s;t never &s;ees either. A believer knows that the merit of what CHRIST did, is his <HI>only</HI> and <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> &s;ource of hope; others can &s;ay it, but they never believe it. True faith in ju&s;ti|fication always corre&s;ponds exactly to the divine te&s;ti|mony concerning CHRIST; &s;uch an atonement, &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;en&s;ible &s;inner feels need of, and this GOD requires him to believe; and he who finds him&s;elf <HI>all-&s;inner,</HI> and all he can naturally do, <HI>all-&s;inful,</HI> will rejoice at &s;ight of a righteou&s;ne&s;s, to per|fection &s;ufficient of it&s;elf, and wrought out on purpo&s;e for the believing &s;inner; on this he tru&s;ts alone, by this he is made ju&s;t, and on this &s;core exclu&s;ively he has abundant acceptance. True faith always has the thing it believes, and produces the genuine effect, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 1. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but dead faith gives no divine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, produces not one divine effect; &s;o the believer is ble&s;&s;ed with faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> the other remains the &s;ame that he was. But it may be &s;aid, "ju&s;tification is to me a dark affair; how &s;hall I know whether I am ju&s;tified or not?"</P>
<P>ANSWER.&mdash;1. Ju&s;tification is not a matter of ex|perience; 'tis a great change, but 'tis merely relative. It lies not in the frame of the mind, but in the rela|tion, which the per&s;on as a &s;inner bore to a righteous GOD, and his law. All the claim a &s;inner has on GOD, is wrath; all the title he has in law, is cur&s;e. Now, in ju&s;tification, that claim, and this title are totally &s;olved; his relation to GOD and the law, as a &s;inner, is made wholly void; &s;o he is dead to the law, that he might, in con&s;i&s;tence with the law, be made alive unto GOD. Ju&s;tification therefore is the ab&s;olving &s;entence of the judge.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="009895_0029_0F7AD5198EDDEC68">2. BY the go&s;pel method of &s;aving men, no per|&s;on is ju&s;tified, but upon knowledge of his hopele&s;s ruin, as has been &s;hewn, in every way, but by CHRIST, and what he has done; for only by &s;uch knowledge is the natural preventive of &s;aving faith removed; "the whole don't need a phy&s;ician." Doubtle&s;s, therefore, if thou ha&s;t never yet &s;o come in &s;ight of thy own &s;elf, thou art &s;till unju&s;tified: For with GOD, only the poor and needy find mercy.</P>
<P N="3">3. JUSTIFICATION is naturally followed with free|dom of con&s;cience. In a &s;tate of &s;in, the con&s;cience is always in bondage by guilt, which is its own feel|ing, that it mu&s;t &s;uffer for doing wrong. This felt nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering, takes its life and &s;trength from GOD and the law; but the &s;inner's relation to GOD and his law, as a &s;inner, is made void in ju&s;tification; of con&s;equence the con&s;cience mu&s;t be freed from its guilty bond:&mdash;"Being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with GOD;" <HI>i. e.</HI> the account is &s;ettled with the avenger, by what CHRIST did, now imputed; whereas to his own view, he always knows he is the &s;inner &s;till.</P>
<P N="4">4. JUSTIFICATION is always followed by &s;anctifi|cation. Sanctification don't con&s;i&s;t in outwardly do|ing right; but it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch purifying of the con&s;cience, as knowledge of divine objects nece&s;&s;arily makes; "beholding his glory we are changed:" which objects are no &s;ooner known than loved, and &s;o give &s;pring to all practical holine&s;s. Ju&s;tification is in order of nature, but not of time, before &s;anctifica|tion; "whom he ju&s;tified, them he glorified," by beginning their heavenly holine&s;s at the &s;ame time. As &s;oon as GOD cau&s;ed <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s iniquity to pa&s;s from him, his filthy garments were taken off, and he was cloathed with change of raiment, <HI>Zech.</HI> iii. 4.
<PB N="31" REF="009895_0030_0F7AD51A4D72B7F0">
Ju&s;tification is in&s;tantly perfect, but &s;anctification only then begins, and increa&s;es to perfection in glory. True faith, ju&s;t as it is, the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e things, effectuates the de&s;ign of them, in the believer; in every point of which efficacy, it is entirely di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all other faith.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE &s;ubjects of living and dead faith both <HI>&s;ay</HI> there is an in&s;eparable connection between holine&s;s and happine&s;s: But they differ widely in their notions of both parts of the connection. They alike read and profe&s;s, that "the pure in heart &s;hall &s;ee GOD;" and the believer knows what that purity of heart is, as it &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mo&s;t religious outward life in the world; he knows al&s;o the con|nected certainty of &s;eeing GOD, and what it means, and that the connection takes place now, or never. Accordingly he hungers and thir&s;ts after righteou&s;|ne&s;s; cries out of the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;in; longs for more purity, as the only way in which to enjoy GOD, the &s;um of all his happine&s;s.&mdash;He wars again&s;t the fir&s;t ri&s;ings of &s;in in his heart, and his only relief from it, is in &s;ight of atoning blood, from which alone &s;prings up repentance and a &s;ight of pardon.&mdash;His prayer is, <HI>let the Lord &s;peak, and make my heart &s;ound in all thy &s;tatutes, then &s;hall I not be a&s;hamed.</HI> Whereas other profe&s;&s;ors, if their lives are outwardly regular, in their own &s;en&s;e, they are well enough; holy enough; and if they can but make up an indolent <HI>hope-&s;o,</HI> they are happy enough. As to &s;uch happi|ne&s;s as con&s;i&s;ts in the light of GOD, they put all that to the account of another life. So differently are they affected by their faith.</P>
<P>THESE two &s;orts of chri&s;tians differ widely in their notions of good works; both hold a nece&s;&s;ity of them, but one &s;ort know they mu&s;t be the produce of living

They who believe, maintain good works, <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 8;&mdash;while the other &s;ort &s;et down for &s;uch, all their &s;ober, well-meant, religious actions, if not &s;ome others. To make a good work, the fir&s;t &s;ort con&s;ider the origi|nal, motive, and view of an action; the other, only the &s;eeming beauty of the thing done, regardle&s;s of its internal qualities, or relation to the law. Hence ari&s;e &s;everal ob&s;ervable events.</P>
<P N="1">1. SOME profe&s;&s;ors, though they know their lives and manners are unexceptionable enough, yet can't be ea&s;y with them&s;elves, becau&s;e they don't &s;ee GOD, and feel the divine life; their views are low and &s;en|&s;ual, the love of GOD is not &s;hed abroad in their hearts, nor they governed by faith, 'tis di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and they cannot be ea&s;y. Others, in the mean time, though they &s;ee and feel none of the&s;e things, as in|deed they never do; are ea&s;y and happy, as long as they can keep up their u&s;ual regularity and hope-&s;o's. This is their holine&s;s, and their &s;en&s;e of it is their happine&s;s: "Verily they have their reward."</P>
<P N="2">2. SOME profe&s;&s;ors are ever apt to be jealous of their hearts, le&s;t, after all, they &s;hould be &s;ome way &s;e|duced and deceived by them; they have a watchful eye over them, they dare not tru&s;t them. Indeed for want of a &s;ight of divine grace, are often fearful to admit the mo&s;t precious things of the everla&s;ting covenant, for their comfort and relief. While others are forward enough, very forward to catch a piece at wi&s;dom's table, without regard to order; if they can get hold of a promi&s;e, no matter by what right. This is a rea&s;on why the pure&s;t go&s;pel-preaching is no more u&s;eful; GOD'S people are often &s;hy to take the full latitude of its ble&s;&s;ings for their help; and fal&s;e

profe&s;&s;ors <HI>will</HI> apply them for their hardening. The di&s;ciples all &s;aid, "LORD is it I," except <HI>Judas,&mdash;Mark</HI> xiv. 19.</P>
<P N="3">3. SOME profe&s;&s;ors, in time of trouble, run &s;peedily to the throne of grace, to the feet of mercy; they &s;ay each, "it is the LORD, what would&s;t thou have me to do?" and hear him &s;ay, "by this &s;hall the iniquity of <HI>Jacob</HI> be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his &s;in." Then comes prayer, "LORD humble me! clean&s;e my &s;oul, and heal me!" And then, "remove thy &s;troke away from me." But others fly only to means, to &s;chemes, in which to terminate their hopes. Or they &s;it down and &s;ay, "ah! 'tis the com|mon lot of all men, and we mu&s;t take our chance with the re&s;t."</P>
<P N="4">4. SOME profe&s;&s;ors heartily prefer the clo&s;e&s;t go&s;|pel preaching, they &s;eek and prize it, and the more di&s;tingui&s;hing it is, the better. But with others he is the be&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable preacher, who dwells in generals; troubles not their ears with tho&s;e nice and heart-di&s;turbing di&s;tinctions. Their hopes are fair, and their hearts are ea&s;y, and they choo&s;e to have them kept &s;o. If &s;inners are alarmed, they are di&s;turbed; if &s;aints rejoice, their envy ri&s;es. Indeed if all is quiet, they are well, but if <HI>Zion</HI> pro&s;pers, they repine: And if they them&s;elves are urged with downright bible truth, they will not bear it. Yet all the while holding they are &s;inners, and mu&s;t be holy, or no hope of heaven. So totally de&s;titute of any thing an|&s;werable to their belief, are all fal&s;e believers.</P>
<P N="8">8. ALL profe&s;s to believe a future judgment and approaching eternity. And with &s;ome their faith makes them real, pre&s;ent things, and they are &s;uitably affected with them. They have a view to the coming of the LORD, in all their ways; and to live like dying

and accountable per&s;ons for all they do and &s;ay. For "he that hath this hope purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure," 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 3. But others know they mu&s;t die, and after that come to judgment; yet they live on, in pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual objects, corn, wine, oil; crying peace, peace, 'till &s;udden de&s;truction comes upon them. They are concerned about many things, but lea&s;t of all how to know CHRIST, and be found in him.&mdash;Of all this, the lives of the multitude are a flagrant proof; they hold the&s;e truths in their unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, and on them is the wrath of GOD revealed. Vain men! &s;ays St, <HI>James,</HI> "can faith &s;ave you?"</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third and la&s;t trial propo&s;ed was, true faith produces ju&s;t &s;uch effects as the &s;criptures a&s;cribe to true faith.&mdash;But not one of them does any other faith produce.</P>
<P N="1">1. ONE notable effect which the &s;criptures a&s;cribe to divine faith is, that by mean of it a &s;inner is made a ju&s;t per&s;on in the &s;ight of GOD. And yet 'tis not po&s;&s;ible any action of a &s;inner's heart &s;hould do this; for then 'tis &s;omething in that act, which gives it its divine worth and efficacy. And if any act done by a &s;oul can from its own goodne&s;s and value ju&s;tify a &s;inner before GOD, there was no need of CHRIST, according to <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 21. This would make faith a work of the law, by &s;uppo&s;ing that act of the &s;inner, had in it&s;elf, &s;ome quality an&s;werable to the nature and de&s;ign of the law, which is an ab&s;urdity in terms, a natural impo&s;&s;ibility; upon which therefore, and upon all &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed works, the in&s;pired apo&s;tle fixes de&s;pair of ju&s;tification, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 20. Faith then ju&s;tifies a &s;inner only as the perfection of CHRIST'S lawful righteou&s;ne&s;s is its matter or thing believed. The ca&s;e is this.&mdash;When a per&s;on is brought to &s;ee him&s;elf <HI>all-&s;inner,</HI> GOD makes him believe what the
<PB N="35" REF="009895_0034_0F7AD51EEE8443A0">
bible &s;ays about CHRIST as the divine &s;aviour, by &s;hewing him the truth of it, which he never would, or could &s;ee before; for faith is the gift of GOD, only to &s;uch as &s;ee them&s;elves." In this believing, GOD ju&s;tifies him, while yet ungodly, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 5. By accounting that perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s which CHRIST wrought for &s;inners, to this per&s;on, as he always &s;aid he would to &s;uch as believe it. And then, on the &s;ame account, he purifies his con&s;cience, and takes him for one of his own people, <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 4 to 7. So he is &s;aid to be ju&s;tified by faith, becau&s;e it could not be done 'till he believed the ju&s;tifying truth. But no &s;ooner does he believe the truth, than that truth &s;ets his &s;oul at liberty: "The truth &s;hall make you free." Now this faith actually operates ju&s;t &s;o to the &s;inner, as the &s;cripture &s;aid it would. But there is no other faith which is capable of producing any &s;uch effect.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe our title to all new-cove|nant goods, to faith. Believers are all the children of GOD by faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 26.

Whereas dead faith has no title, but to that wrath which is revealed again&s;t its own unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s. But to be particular;</P>
<P N="1">1. A BELIEVER has right to the favour and accep|tance of GOD.&mdash;That believing &s;inners have divine rights the unerring word affirms.&mdash;<HI>John</HI> i. 12, "As many as received him, to them gave he <HI>exou&s;ian</HI> right, <HI>tekna Theou gene&s;thai,</HI> to be children of GOD." <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 14, "They that do his commandments," which is the ca&s;e of believers only, "have right to the tree of life," <HI>i. e.</HI> to CHRIST and all his benefits. The word is <HI>exou&s;ia.</HI> And by the &s;ame <HI>right</HI> they enter in through the gates, to enjoy all the privileges of
<PB N="36" REF="009895_0035_0F7AD51F91B48820">
the holy city. Their right by heir&s;hip is al&s;o very fa|miliar in the go&s;pel; "if children, then heirs." The word is <HI>kleeronomoi,</HI> for they hold by law all that is given them: Therefore "heirs of GOD, and joint heirs with CHRIST, who&s;e is the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and di&s;|tribution of all things. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e believers "inherit the promi&s;es," have and hold them by right of heir&s;hip; &s;o they have "an inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified."&mdash;And &s;o every believer "inherits all things." Two things naturally prevent men of the&s;e rights; one is, the &s;ubject is a willing &s;inner, always &s;ins with all his heart. But this pre|ventive is removed entirely, when, upon &s;ight of CHRIST, he is enabled to believe the lawful righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the go&s;pel: and when thereupon, by imputa|tion, it becomes his own. For thereby he is per|fectly ju&s;tified, and in&s;tantly begins to be made holy. And though he will never have any lawful holine&s;s, naturally his own; yet CHRIST having engaged by covenant to maintain and promote his &s;anctification to final glory, this believer is admitted into chri&s;tian rights, as if he was a true natural &s;on. His rights al&s;o are more &s;ure, and more happifying, than if he was naturally a true &s;on. The other thing which natu|rally excludes from the&s;e rights, is, the un&s;atisfied de|mands of injured ju&s;tice and the law. But the&s;e CHRIST has fully an&s;wered, by atonement equal to their nature. There remains, therefore, nothing, on the part of ju&s;tice, or the law, or on the part of the be|liever, to keep him out of favour; and he may now, hourly claim acceptance in the name and right of his redeemer, transferred to him, inviolably confirmed on him through believing. So now, "he who was afar off, is made nigh by the blood of CHRIST."&mdash;"He is our peace, who has made both one, having broken
<PB N="37" REF="009895_0036_0F7AD52057A30680">
down the partition, and aboli&s;hed the enmity." Of con&s;equence, "GOD is not a&s;hamed to be called the believer's own GOD and father." Accordingly his con&s;tant language is, "come unto me," "walk with me;" "a&s;k what ye will and it &s;hall be done," "tru&s;t in me nothing doubting," "I will give thee the de&s;ires of thine heart." "I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting love," "I will never leave thee nor for|&s;ake thee;" "but will deliver thee in &s;ix troubles and in &s;even;" nay, "all things &s;hall work together for thy good." Believers are not at liberty to u&s;e the&s;e rights or not, but are bound to claim accom|pli&s;hments; <HI>"do as thou ha&s;t &s;aid,"</HI> "fulfill the word on which thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed me to hope." But dead faith is as &s;trange and ignorant to all the&s;e <HI>things,</HI> as an infant to philo&s;ophy, or a pagan to the love of GOD; and never comes nearer than, "what ha&s;t thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth?"</P>
<P N="2">2. FAITH has title to all nece&s;&s;ary temporal goods. For this, GOD has engaged his infallible truth, "ve|rily thou &s;halt be fed," <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxxvii. 3.&mdash;"All the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto thee."&mdash;"Tru&s;t in him and he &s;hall bring it to pa&s;s."&mdash;"He &s;hall give thee the de&s;ires of thine heart."&mdash;"He healeth all thy di&s;ea&s;es, redeemeth thy life from de&s;truction, crowneth thee with loving-kindne&s;s and render mercies, and &s;atis|fieth thy mouth with good things," <HI>P&s;al.</HI> ciii. Yea, no <HI>good thing</HI> will he withhold from faith. But it may be &s;aid, where then is faith to be found? For who, or where is he, who is thus ble&s;&s;ed with good things?</P>
<P>ANSWER.&mdash;1. You mu&s;t not judge of the rights of faith by every defect, or outward want of its &s;ubjects; but by the expre&s;s letter of its grants, made and &s;e|cured to it in the covenant of truth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="009895_0037_0F7AD52113FACEA0">2. YOU are not to judge every profe&s;&s;or to be a true believer; nor any an unbeliever, merely for &s;ome outward trouble or want, for the poor in this world are often rich in faith, and their portion is &s;afe and &s;ure, though not all yet dealt out.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT if any man is lacking in the &s;piritual mer|cies of the covenant, 'tis evidence he is lacking in faith, to which the&s;e divine rights are all &s;ecured. But if he be needy of outward goods, 'tis no evidence he has not &s;uch, and all &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary, good, and be&s;t <HI>for him,</HI> at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. HE who would experience more of the&s;e rights of faith, mu&s;t under&s;tand, believe, and put to trial what our LORD teaches&mdash;<HI>Matt.</HI> xvi. 24 to 26, "If any man will come after me," and &s;o find what his joint heir&s;hip with me imports, "let him deny him|&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s." This is chri&s;tianity; faith fir&s;t took place in total &s;elf-denial, and ever after pines, or prevails, on the u&s;e or di&s;u&s;e of this cardinal doctrine; the old rule &s;till &s;tands as good as ever, "according to thy faith be it unto thee." And &s;o it comes to pa&s;s, that as often, and in the &s;ame degree, as a chri&s;tian &s;eeks, or indulges his &s;en&s;ual or &s;elfi&s;h life, he lo&s;es in the life of faith; on the contrary, ju&s;t &s;o much as is ceded to this, is lo&s;t to that.</P>
<P N="5">5. ON the whole, the rights of faith are all <HI>certain|ties,</HI> "ye &s;hall a&s;k what ye will and it &s;hall be done." The de&s;ires and prayers of faith, (and truly no other ever reach the ears of a covenant GOD) are filial, "not my will, but thine be done." Accordingly he who <HI>knows</HI> what, when and how, is be&s;t, has re&s;erved the execution of all the rights of faith to him&s;elf, that they may <HI>certainly</HI> all take place, infallibly and uni|ver&s;ally, according to his covenant engagements, that no believer may ever be a&s;hamed, world without end.
<PB N="39" REF="009895_0038_0F7AD521D3CBE2E8">
Here is the patience of faith, waiting the will of GOD, in every thing, as the hu&s;bandman for his harve&s;t. And here is one in&s;tance of the a&s;&s;urance of faith, al|ways knowing that in due time we &s;hall reap, if we faint not. Indeed, as a GOD of nature, he gives food to the ravers, and &s;ends his &s;un and rain on the un|ju&s;t; but as a covenant GOD, in which character e&s;|pecially faith has to do with him, the rule is, <HI>"thou wilt prepare their heart, and cau&s;e thine ear to hear."</HI> But men generally finding many things flow from the GOD of nature, as &s;uch, care not on what right they come; &s;o a covenant GOD is not in all their thoughts; the&s;e at be&s;t are dead believers.</P>
<P N="3">3. FAITH has right to deliverance from troubles. "Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me."&mdash;"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them <HI>all.</HI>" On &s;uch truth, faith fixes, and is &s;ure of deliverance; but as to when and how, is never &s;ure beyond the letter of a promi&s;e. If the chri&s;tian is prepared with patient faith, and &s;o with mortification, or &s;elf-denial, enough to improve de|liverance to the purpo&s;es of the promi&s;e, he may ex|pect it &s;peedily, becau&s;e "he will exalt them <HI>in due time,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 6.&mdash;So true faith has harbour, and anchor-hold by which to ride out every &s;torm; while dead faith, ea&s;y 'till trouble comes, is forced to &s;ink, or fly like chaff before the wind.</P>
<P N="4">4. FAITH has right to &s;piritual mercies here and hereafter.&mdash;Grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from tho&s;e who walk uprightly." The extent of faith's claims is the letter of the promi&s;es, and &s;o for things not named there, it &s;ays, "if the LORD will, we &s;hall live and do this, or that." Yet on &s;piritual goods e&s;pecially, faith may in&s;i&s;t, knowing
<PB N="40" REF="009895_0039_0F7AD5228C6A48A0">
already that the will of GOD is our &s;anctification," and that 'tis his good plea&s;ure to give us the kingdom. Whereas dead faith in&s;i&s;ts on temporal goods, and he|&s;itates only about &s;pirituals.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe a&s;&s;urance to faith&mdash;"Let us draw near in full a&s;&s;urance of faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 22. Now as faith is a believing the &s;cipture account of things, &s;o the a&s;&s;urance of faith, is the &s;en&s;ible clear|ne&s;s and &s;trength of the evidence, on which faith in that ca&s;e &s;tands. Therefore the apo&s;tle, <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 2, calls it <HI>the full a&s;&s;urance of under&s;tanding.</HI> Con&s;equently,</P>
<P N="1">1. ASSURANCE of faith is not a&s;&s;urance of our own good or &s;afe e&s;tate. Such a&s;&s;urance cannot in it&s;elf be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a fal&s;e confidence, and if it could, would generally be of little continuance, and le&s;s u&s;e; nor does the &s;cripture u&s;e the word in this &s;en&s;e at all. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxxii. 17, &s;peaks of CHRIST'S righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the con&s;equent peace with GOD, and the &s;en&s;ible certainty of the things believed. As to 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 19, it &s;peaks of the a&s;&s;urance of hope, which &s;uppo&s;es the a&s;&s;urance of faith as above de|&s;cribed. 'Tis as evident,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT in ca&s;e of true faith, there is always as much a&s;&s;urance as faith, never more, never le&s;s. For faith is knowledge of divine objects, or things believed, and the evidence of truth in that ca&s;e, makes faith's a&s;&s;urance.&mdash;So they mu&s;t agree, and be in&s;eparable. So the go&s;pel came to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> in much a&s;&s;urance or &s;en&s;ible certainty, as to its matter, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> i. 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'TIS as evident that hope, and its a&s;&s;urance, of which in <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 11, differ much from the ca&s;e of faith. Chri&s;tian hope ri&s;es from a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t in, or title to, tho&s;e matters of promi&s;e which are objects of faith; and the a&s;&s;urance of hope, is the &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="41" REF="009895_0040_0F7AD523548EF080">
certainty of &s;uch intere&s;t. Hence this is the grand object of &s;elf-examination; therefore the apo&s;tle, in the la&s;t-mentioned text, directs us to give diligence to have our hope clear. Experience makes hope, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 4, but not faith; and this hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of GOD is &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given to us: Of the&s;e dead faith knows nothing at all.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe to faith, a remarkably humbling virtue. It beholds the glory of the LORD, and in the light of it &s;hews the per&s;on to him&s;elf, "in thy light, we &s;ee light." Hence nothing more na|tural to a chri&s;tian, than, "behold I am vile." In this, true and fal&s;e faith differ, one has as much hum|blene&s;s of mind, as it has of believing; the other has ju&s;t &s;o much religious pride. To one, a &s;mile of GOD is the only mean of humbling; only the &s;uppo&s;ition of it, with the other, is the food of its pride. Suppo&s;ed appearances of grace and love of GOD, have always ju&s;t &s;o contrary effects on them. The one always claims &s;ome goodne&s;s of heart of its own, the other never; &s;o one has boa&s;ting, the other none. The &s;ubject of the one is always bad enough in him&s;elf to be condemned now, the other always too good. Therefore with the one, the judgments of GOD are right, but with the other, too hard.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe to faith a peculiar effi|cacy to plea&s;e GOD.&mdash;"Without faith 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e him, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 6. True faith hearkens to his voice, receives his te&s;timony, regards his honour, tru&s;ts his truth, does his will, and the&s;e are its life and only delight; not one of which is true of any other faith. Nothing is more natural to the former than "thy will be done." The other always re&s;i&s;ts the manife&s;t de&s;ign of the will of GOD. The one &s;ubmits
<PB N="42" REF="009895_0041_0F7AD52468007698">
to his correcting hand, the other &s;ubmits and plea&s;es in nothing, "he is angry with the wicked every day."</P>
<P N="6">6. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe to faith a purifying vir|tue, "beholding his glory, we are changed into the &s;ame image." It a&s;&s;imulates the &s;oul to its objects; and of cour&s;e, begets &s;elf-loathing, and abhorrence of every &s;en&s;ual ta&s;te. Thence the believer's prayer is, "clean&s;e me, O LORD, from &s;ecret faults;" "purge me with hy&s;&s;op, that I may be clean." Dead faith may occa&s;ion a reformation of life, though, in that, its influ|ence is from &s;elfi&s;h views; but it never makes evan|gelical purity, becau&s;e it never &s;ees evangelical ob|jects, the only patterns of, and incentives to holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe to faith, a divine life and &s;piritual growth.&mdash;"I live by the faith of the &s;on of GOD," <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 20, and <HI>"your faith groweth ex|ceedingly,"</HI> 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> i. 3.&mdash;So now, a chri&s;tian becomes fruitful in every good work, and increa&s;es in the knowledge of GOD, only through believing. 'Tis by faith that he grows in grace, and in the love of GOD; and &s;o goes from faith to faith, gets clearer views of GOD, and con&s;equently more &s;elf-emptying experience of him&s;elf; and &s;o grows up toward the &s;tature of &s;uch as be perfect. Whereas dead faith, never having divine life, can never divinely grow; hence the evident difference in point of life, &s;piritu|ality, and growth among vi&s;ible chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE &s;criptures a&s;cribe to faith, a &s;trange power to bear up under trials. Faith is &s;o the &s;ub&s;tance, and pre&s;ent evidence of the glorious power, and &s;uf|ficiency of CHRIST, that it "&s;trengthens with <HI>all might,</HI> in the inner man, unto all patience and long-&s;uffering with joyfulne&s;s," <HI>Col.</HI> i. 11. This &s;trength and &s;up|port to the believer is by the &s;pirit of truth, <HI>Eph.</HI> iii. 16.&mdash;So that he can endure as &s;eeing him who is
<PB N="43" REF="009895_0042_0F7AD524D54A0320">
invi&s;ible, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 27. He has &s;en&s;e of a pre&s;ent GOD, "lo I am with you;" and &s;o of his righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy, his encompa&s;&s;ing arms, his wi&s;dom to or|der, and his &s;overeign power to &s;ave, with the never-failing truth of his covenant engagements, to i&s;&s;ue this trouble for &s;ome divine purpo&s;e, "all things &s;hall work together for good." Faith can &s;ee a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of this trial, in this manner, and at this time, "if need be ye are in heavine&s;s." It knows there is a kind de&s;ign, "whom I love I rebuke and cha&s;ten." Hence a chri&s;tian can approve his troubles, "'tis good for me that I have been afflicted." In every furnace of affliction, true faith has one like the &s;on of man, ever pre&s;ent. So it can be joyful in tribulation, and thankful for its kind de&s;ign, and precious effects. While dead faith either murmurs or de&s;pairs, is &s;en&s;e|le&s;s, or &s;ullen under correction. Hence GOD often removes their &s;troke, &s;aying "why &s;hould ye be &s;tricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more."</P>
<P N="9">9. THE &s;criptures teach us that acce&s;s to GOD is by faith, <HI>Eph.</HI> iii. 12, "in whom we have boldne&s;s, and acce&s;s with confidence, by the faith of him." Faith has acce&s;s to GOD in the following ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN the habitual views of the mind. A chri&s;tian knows that GOD, with all his perfections on, is where <HI>he</HI> is; "thou GOD &s;ee&s;t me." He knows the eye of GOD to &s;ee, his ear to hear, his arm of power to help, his mercy to pity, and his fulne&s;s to &s;upply, are al|ways pre&s;ent. A believer, con&s;idered in that character, knows that he lives and moves, and thinks and &s;peaks in GOD. He can truly &s;ay, "I am not alone, becau&s;e the father is with me." And yet he is no more ter|rified than the bu&s;h was burned; but has clo&s;e acce&s;s to him, &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of him. He lives, and walks, and works, in fellow&s;hip with GOD, 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 7. This
<PB N="44" REF="009895_0043_0F7AD5258C690468">
is the life of the believer's life; but the thought of it is deadly, to dead faith.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN ejaculatory communion.&mdash;The living chri&s;|tian is ever, now and then, whi&s;pering in the ear of his GOD, <Q>Oh for more holine&s;s! Oh to have this heart, nature, humour, pa&s;&s;ion, more mortified through knowledge of thy glory! Oh for direction in my way, for ordering my affairs, for help in this duty, for &s;upport in this trial, for &s;trength to en|dure this hard&s;hip!</Q> True faith has ever &s;ome|thing to &s;ay to its GOD, pleading, prai&s;ing, confe&s;|&s;ing, or &s;omething; and &s;omething to hear from him in his word, by the &s;pirit thereof, teaching, quicken|ing, reproving, and &s;uch like. They who walk in the light, as GOD is in the light, have con&s;tantly &s;uch fellow&s;hip one with another, 1 <HI>John.</HI> i. 7;&mdash;that is, HE and they.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN devolving heavy burdens upon him.&mdash;"Ca&s;t thy burden upon the LORD, and he &s;hall &s;u&s;tain thee." Many a time the chri&s;tian's heart mu&s;t &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ing weights, of &s;in, cares, bu&s;ine&s;s, or afflic|tion, if it were not for this relief. But faith &s;eeing room and rea&s;on for it, and finding ab&s;olute need, delivers over its concerns according to the precept, and finds relief according to the promi&s;e. Dead faith can only ea&s;e the heart by &s;ight of natural means, or &s;uppo&s;ed prevalence of &s;ome per&s;onal con&s;ideration with GOD, or by a mere indolent pre&s;umption of a favourable i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P N="4">4. IN &s;pecial duties, whether publick, &s;ecret or private.&mdash;Faith has directly to do with GOD in duties, by it the &s;oul comes to its &s;eat, and orders its cau&s;e there. It comes to GOD him&s;elf, leaning on the be|loved, and receives in&s;tructive an&s;wers from his word and works. While dead faith plays off, with its
<PB N="45" REF="009895_0044_0F7AD5264AB9C9E0">
long dry forms and tools, and receives no an&s;wers, but from imagination, or pre-conceived de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="5">5. IN &s;udden and unfore&s;een occurrences.&mdash;Whe|ther they are pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, faith in&s;tantly &s;ays, "'Tis the LORD, let him do what &s;eemeth him good." It can bid welcome to, and be thankful for, the mo&s;t &s;udden corrective incident, as well as be hum|bly &s;urprized with mercies. They alike &s;hew that GOD "is good, and doeth good, and his tender mercies are over all his works." Yea, if the believer &s;ees &s;econd cau&s;es, or wicked in&s;truments in his affliction, he knows they may de&s;ign evil by it, but that GOD means it for good. True faith will ki&s;s the rod, and love the humbling &s;troke; in all which dead faith is ju&s;t the rever&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. AND la&s;tly.&mdash;Chri&s;tian faith is victorious faith. "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith," 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 4. Faith pre&s;ents &s;uch reality and excellency in divine objects, as attracts the mind away from things of &s;en&s;e, and fairly &s;olves their &s;trong dominion. 'Tis faith rai&s;es the chri&s;tian above the world, and daily carries him, with a gentle gale, over the frowns, the &s;miles, and &s;hifting changes of the creatures. By this his corruptions are &s;ubdued; by this he conquers Satan and the world; by this he is &s;upported in adver&s;ity, prevails at the throne of grace, and lives at ea&s;e, amid&s;t all the enemies of his peace: "For where the &s;pirit of the LORD is, there is liberty;" "and his &s;oul &s;hall dwell at ea&s;e." But dead faith has either &s;tupid &s;ecurity, or el&s;e has bon|dage through fear of death eternal. Faith has two &s;cenes to conquer through, <HI>viz.</HI> this life, and the hour of death; in both of which unfailing conque&s;t is already &s;ure from the mouth of GOD, not with de|&s;ign to anticipate the utmo&s;t exertion of all its vir|tues, but to invigorate them.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="46" REF="009895_0045_0F7AD527AA831650">1. FAITH has to conquer through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> vio|lence, and the &s;ly intrigues of its numerous enemies in the pre&s;ent life. For all this, its &s;trength and &s;kill is hid with CHRIST in GOD, "our &s;prings are all in thee;" and "our &s;ufficiency is of GOD." The believer then may boldly &s;ay, as numerous and mighty as his enemies are, "through GOD I can ru&s;h through an ho&s;t," and through him "can leap over a wall." In this manner have GOD'S people always found their way through this vale of tears; the road is the &s;ame, faith's enemies &s;till the &s;ame, our &s;inful natures, and almighty helper both the &s;ame. Hence the hi&s;tory of the nature and &s;ituation, the trials and conque&s;ts of faith, in the &s;acred book, are mo&s;t adapt to every one of us. 'Tis an ignorant mi&s;take in this point, to dream that we &s;tand on a higher &s;tage of natural abilities and advantages, than go&s;pel &s;ubjects a thou|&s;and years ago; it renders the bible of little u&s;e, and damps the heart, and perplexes the path of the be|lieving warrior now. If the bible was a collection of lives and trials, &s;trange e&s;capes, and final joys, of &s;ome godly per&s;ons in this pre&s;ent age, commended to our certain belief, and con&s;tant imitation, with &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance to us of an equally happy i&s;&s;ue; would it not &s;eem a more engaging directory than it is now? The only rea&s;on mu&s;t be becau&s;e the path was &s;treaked, and all the patterns &s;et by human na|ture in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and in our own times. Now faith &s;ees exactly that advantage in the bible as it is; &s;ees the facts in the &s;ame point of ea&s;y and engaging light, &s;ees the examples for our in&s;truction and imi|tation, equally in&s;tructive, equally imitable by the weake&s;t chri&s;tian. They are &s;et before us on pur|po&s;e "that he may run that reads;" and &s;o calcu|lated that "wayfaring men, though fools, &s;hall not
<PB N="47" REF="009895_0046_0F7AD52854418C00">
err therein." From this trea&s;ury the believer, what|ever his other circum&s;tances are, may be thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good work." From this armoury, equipped for the whole war,&mdash;"Lo I am with you," and "my grace is &s;ufficient for you," will make any believer of them couragious, whatever is his exigen|cy. Indeed a chri&s;tian needs no more than to believe GOD, in order to be quite &s;ure of all he can need, "there is no want to them that fear him;" "he is ever mindful of his covenant," "and will withhold no good thing from them who walk uprightly." And he has not only &s;aid all we need, but 'tis &s;ure, "his word is &s;ettled in heaven," and "he cannot deny him&s;elf." The&s;e things only <HI>believed,</HI> will make the &s;ubject "wax valiant in fight, turning to flight whole armies of aliens." It will immediately appear, that the world and all the creatures, pre&s;ent things, and things to come, are within the rights of living faith, When 'tis &s;een to be the <HI>word of</HI> GOD, "that <HI>all things &s;hall work together for good,</HI>" and "ye &s;hall a&s;k what ye will, and it &s;hall be done," and "no|thing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible unto you," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then faith will be victorious in all trials, and not 'till then. Dead faith can't be victorious in any thing, becau&s;e it can't take the bible for truth, &s;o can't affect the &s;ubject by its &s;pirit or grace, nor ever does.</P>
<P N="2">2. DIVINE faith is victorious in death; there it conquers the conqueror. The believer, like <HI>Samp|&s;on,</HI> and like his &s;aviour, always conquers in death, and dies in his la&s;t conque&s;t. Indeed death to a chri&s;tian is a different thing from what it is to any other; while 'tis a cur&s;e to others, 'tis a ble&s;&s;ed pri|vilege to him. But all the privilege he has in death, he has by what he believes; the &s;aviour's conque&s;t becomes his own by believing it. He knows death

in no &s;en&s;e can have dominion over him, becau&s;e his own &s;aviour, has conquered it in every &s;en&s;e, and in right of that conque&s;ts he triumphs. Indeed he don't expect to be hyed away, through endle&s;s tracts of pathle&s;s &s;pace, to a heaven beyond the &s;tars; but as what &s;eparated him from GOD here, was yielding to fle&s;h and &s;en&s;e; &s;o what kept him out of the hea|venly &s;tate, was his confinement to this body; of cour&s;e, relea&s;e from that mu&s;t be commencement of the heavenly &s;tate, ab&s;ent from the body, is to be pre&s;ent with the LORD, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 6, 8. As GOD is pre&s;ent every where, and his immediate enjoyment is heaven, &s;o all, but in the body, is glorious heaven. Faith &s;ees this, and is &s;ure enough of the ble&s;&s;ed vi&s;ion, and glorious enjoyments, the in&s;tant which &s;uc|ceeds his di&s;&s;olution. In the mid&s;t of which GOD has promi&s;ed, and faith enjoys "perfect peace," "the mind is &s;tayed on him." When nature's bonds are loo&s;ed, he is at the church of the fir&s;t-born in glory; the &s;ame in&s;tant faith is &s;wallowed up in vi&s;ion, and the long &s;truggling &s;pirit leaping from its own con|finement into boundle&s;s day and liberty, leaves the ga&s;ping cottage to the long-proved truth of GOD, for a glorious re&s;urrection; then to be re&s;umed with glo|rious advantage, and everla&s;ting plea&s;ure; it&s;elf claiming for JESUS' &s;ake, the immediate and freely offered embracements of pre&s;ent divinity, and ming|ling it&s;elf, mo&s;t welcome, with angels and the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, &s;ees the glory, feels the joys, and &s;houts the &s;ongs of that <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Now it &s;ees, in their boundle&s;s original, the wi&s;dom, power, grace and love, that made and maintained it, enlightened, turned and guided it, &s;trengthened and pre&s;erved it, from moment to moment, without wearine&s;s, to this never-to-be-fini&s;hed rapture.

He is now in heaven; and wherever the &s;ervice of his dear-loved Maker and Redeemer requires his at|tendance, whether immediately tracing and adoring the &s;earchle&s;s deeps of holy truth; or &s;et to guard &s;ome pilgrim yet in fle&s;h, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 9; or darting on behe&s;ts to further &s;tars; whatever his &s;pecial em|ployment is, which doubtle&s;s is a&s;&s;igned to plea&s;e and improve his natural turn of mind, he is in perfect &s;atisfaction. And that which crowns every moment of that exi&s;tence is, 'tis fixed beyond the reach of change, to the pre&s;ent undeceivable a&s;&s;urance of the inhabitant for ever and ever.</P>
<P>NOW let us reflect a little on a point &s;o much out of common view, and yet of &s;uch va&s;t and critical im|portance. And what does the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;t more naturally than,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN he who&s;e faith is a dead faith is yet in his &s;ins, and every moment in danger of endle&s;s fire, let his religion, and his hopes be what they will. He is a child of wrath by nature, even as others, has as much need of being renewed and changed as any per|&s;on in the world; but his dead faith has done ex|actly nothing towards it, to this very hour. It may have deceived him, but it has not &s;aved him; it may have given him &s;trong-grounded hopes, but it has given him no well-grounded hopes; "there is a way which &s;eemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is death." This is doubtle&s;s the ca&s;e with the mo&s;t of people, both old and young, and of every charac|ter; which will abundantly appear, by comparing their evident want of genuine chri&s;tian experience,
<PB N="50" REF="009895_0049_0F7AD52A0AF4DAF8">
with the &s;cripture character of <HI>a believer.</HI> Dead faith may &s;eem right to him who has it, in almo&s;t every thing, but it never an&s;wers, as face an&s;wers to face in a gla&s;s, to the &s;cripture account of &s;aving faith. In|deed he who has it, never brings his faith fairly to trial in the bible court; "ye think (&s;ays our LORD) ye have eternal life there, but they are they which te&s;|tify of me," <HI>John</HI> v. 39. He always fir&s;t admits a fa|vourable bias to his ca&s;e, and then goes to the bible; as <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 15,&mdash;"Ye are they which ju&s;tify your|&s;elves, but GOD knoweth your hearts, for that which is highly e&s;teemed among men, is <HI>abomination</HI> in the &s;ight of God." So he goes on "deceiving and be|ing deceived," 'till he is "given up to &s;trong delu|&s;ion, to <HI>believe</HI> a lie." And doubtle&s;s multitudes go into eternity with this lie "in their right hand," there|fore have they "no bands in their death." Now this was not &s;aid of abandoned wretches, as is often &s;up|po&s;ed, but of &s;uch fal&s;e hopers, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxxiii. In this character there is a decree of eternity again&s;t him, "cur&s;ed be the deceiver," for "he deceiveth his own heart, his religion is vain." The per&s;on we &s;peak of is going towards de&s;truction every moment; and though his dead faith makes him hope, "what is the hope of the hypocrite when GOD takes away his &s;oul?" Reader if this be thy ca&s;e, thou art of tho&s;e "who think them&s;elves to be &s;omething, when they are no|thing, and deceive them&s;elves." Thy dead faith makes thee ea&s;y, but it can't make thee &s;afe; it can harden, but it can't quicken thee. With a deceived believer his hopes make him believe; but with a true believer his faith makes him hope. If the&s;e very hints don't at all alarm thee, let it mind thee, thee to have confidence without evidence, or hope without &s;en&s;ible title, is proof of hypocri&s;y." 'Tis common
<PB N="51" REF="009895_0050_0F7AD52ACFAA0A50">
with unconverted believers, to hope their faith is true, but only low and weak; not con&s;idering that the lowe&s;t and weake&s;t life of an infant always &s;tirs, and breathes; but their dead faith never &s;tirs, never breathes after GOD, holine&s;s, divine communion, or any divine object as &s;uch; there is no beauty in them that they &s;hould be de&s;ired. They want ea&s;e, &s;afety, happine&s;s, but never want the right &s;ort, never in the right way. Their relation to GOD is very dif|ferent from that of chri&s;tians, his wrath was never re|moved from the former, his love never &s;hall be from the latter. To one &s;ort he is a judge and avenger, to the other a father, friend, and &s;aviour; accordingly dead faith makes a &s;ort of fear of GOD, but makes no love to JEHOVAH, while living faith works all by love, and ca&s;ts out &s;lavi&s;h fear. To the &s;ubject of dead faith, let me &s;ay in pity, your faith is not comfortable, "there is no peace to the wicked;" it don't plea&s;e GOD, "he is angry with you every day." It don't agree to the bible, becau&s;e 'tis not the work of GOD; it looks el&s;ewhere for food, for CHRIST'S words judge and condemn it, <HI>John</HI> xii. 48. It don't agree with the way of &s;alvation by faith alone, it always inclines you to &s;ay, "I have done thus and thus, or been &s;uch and &s;o," when you think of acceptance; &s;o never re&s;ts on what CHRIST has done; &s;o certain it is that when you appear before him, he will &s;ay, "I never knew you, depart from me ye cur&s;ed." And don't this alarm you? Don't your own rea&s;on tell you that dead faith can't &s;ave you? Why don't you &s;top and &s;ay, "what good will this profe&s;&s;ion, or the&s;e fal&s;e hopes do me, &s;ince I am going to appear before GOD?" "Had I not better now, while I have oppor|tunity, &s;u&s;pect the wor&s;t, call all my hopes in que&s;|tion, realize my danger, and try to &s;ee my&s;elf wor&s;e,

as much wor&s;e at heart, than the profane, as my proud religion has &s;eemed to &s;et me before them." For truly by this, have you always oppo&s;ed and &s;lighted the believer's CHRIST, and the true &s;pirit, and happine&s;s of the bible. Who knows, but of an heir of hell, as you certainly be now, you may yet become a chri&s;tian and have everla&s;ting life? Which will naturally excite the anxious enquiry,</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT &s;hould an unconverted per&s;on do, that he may get a living faith? Which gives occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, if you ever hear this que&s;tion an&s;wered, by any directions, <HI>to do,</HI> at all, you may at once be &s;ure, the an&s;wer did not come from the bible. Two things will always make this evident; one is, the directed doer, is already dead, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14&mdash;<HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 5. The other is, living faith is GOD'S <HI>gift, Eph.</HI> ii. 8.&mdash;<HI>Phil.</HI> i. 29. Men have natural power as creatures, and by it may perform actions, but 'tis not now in the power of nature to do any thing in the manner in which the go&s;pel requires obedience; "without me ye can do <HI>nothing.</HI>" To come to GOD is the work of faith, therefore &s;ays our LORD, "no man cometh to the fa|ther but <HI>by me.</HI>" With this an unbeliever imme|diately quarrels, although it is as plainly &s;criptural as any thing at all; CHRIST "came not to &s;end peace, &amp;c." <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 34, &amp;c.</P>
<P>QUESTION. Mu&s;t an unconverted per&s;on then, &s;it &s;till, and profe&s;&s;edly do nothing; or go on in his &s;ins allowedly, vexed with plain &s;cripture?</P>
<P>ANSWER.&mdash;1. He who don't &s;ee him&s;elf as the &s;criptures de&s;cribe him, will do nothing of this &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> coming to GOD, or believing on any con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P N="2">2. HE who does &s;o &s;ee him&s;elf, but is not plea&s;ed with it, will work in proportion to his conviction, and
<PB N="53" REF="009895_0052_0F7AD52C542C2770">
nothing &s;hall hinder him, and he will think him&s;elf better than he was before, in front of plain &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE who has this &s;ight, and is plea&s;ed with it, which is the ca&s;e only of a believer, knows that he did nothing evangelically 'till he believed the go&s;pel, and that what he did do, was the food of his pride, and not the relief of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>BUT you will &s;ay, what &s;hall be &s;aid to a poor &s;in|ner?&mdash;An&s;wer 1.&mdash;Say as the bible does, "The &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall die," and "he that believeth not &s;hall be damned."&mdash;Say al&s;o, "CHRIST came to &s;ave &s;in|ners, even the chief," and "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved." 2.&mdash;If he a&s;k for doing, tell him as the bible does, "the whole law;" that nothing le&s;s than <HI>perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> can begin to relieve him. Tell him, if he &s;it &s;till here, he mu&s;t die, but in the LORD there is righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength too. On the whole,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) HE mu&s;t &s;ee him&s;elf, heart and life, ju&s;t &s;uch as the bible de&s;cribes to be the objects of GOD'S wrath, for want of perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, which righteou&s;ne&s;s he cannot get but by believing.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) HE mu&s;t &s;ee CHRIST, ju&s;t as the bible repre|&s;ents him, in all his own glorious fulne&s;s of grace and love, and lawful fulfilling righteou&s;ne&s;s, and be brought to re&s;t, peace and plea&s;ure in both the&s;e views.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) AND for this purpo&s;e he mu&s;t have a faith ju&s;t &s;uch as the bible &s;peaks of, or never can be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) HE may be a&s;&s;ured that on his believing what the bible &s;ays of CHRIST and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;hall be &s;aved; and that GOD does enable thereto &s;uch as &s;ee them&s;elves too vile for any other relief.</P>
<P N="3">3. THERE are a few things which greatly increa&s;e our danger of delu&s;ion in this great affair. One is, there is an univer&s;al natural propen&s;ity in mankind
<PB N="54" REF="009895_0053_0F7AD52E07DA5488">
to <HI>work for life;</HI> it was an excellency in his original con&s;titution, but is now his &s;nare. Another, is as common a fondne&s;s for what in matters of religion, we call <HI>our own.</HI> A third is, that, as a con&s;equence of the former, every part of the &s;aving religion, to cor|rupt nature is all unnatural. The con&s;equence is, every thing which in matters of religion, re&s;ults from our own minds, as its original, is wrong; and no|thing but what derives from GOD, through CHRIST, and &s;o according to &s;cripture, in matters of religion, is to be depended on; nor may we without guilt he|&s;itate a moment about any thing that evidently does &s;o. But then you will &s;ay, "&s;traight is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leads to life," and, "no won|der few there be that find it." The delu&s;ions which are made out of this &s;tate of the ca&s;e are numberle&s;s; we will be confined to two or three generals.</P>
<P N="1">1. UNBELIEVERS generally per&s;uade them&s;elves they do believe.&mdash;And they may, in general, look on the bible as divine, but their belief lacks the above|mentioned di&s;criminations of true faith; it has no &s;uch divine original, is of no &s;uch divine efficacy, don't agree with the bible-a&s;criptions to faith. The &s;ub|ject of true faith always knows it comes from above; others don't, nor ever can know this of their belief. Living faith, as its character, imports, lives and grows, which a dead belief does not. It makes delight in <HI>all</HI> divine objects, which theirs does not. There are two texts of &s;cripture which this &s;ort of believers <HI>cannot</HI> take plea&s;ure in; one is, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy." The other is, "depart from me ye cur&s;ed." And yet they will go on believ|ing contrary to St. <HI>James,</HI> "that their faith can &s;ave them."</P>
<P N="2">2. MULTITUDES agree that it will not do to tru&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="009895_0054_0F7AD52F60768430">
to believing only, for acceptance with GOD; there mu&s;t be concern, or reformation, or duties, or &s;ome|thing be&s;ide barely believing the &s;cripture righteou&s;|ne&s;s. And this fulfills the text, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> lv. 8, 9, "Your ways are not my ways, as the heaven is higher than the earth, &s;o are my ways higher than your ways." Ju&s;t &s;o is the way of acceptance with GOD by believing CHRIST'S perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s alone, than the patch|work way, which can make delu&s;ion, and damnation, but cannot make ju&s;tification and &s;alvation;&mdash;as both St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> bear witne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 3, <HI>James</HI> ii. 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER religious delu&s;ion which ari&s;es from our natural enmity again&s;t the go&s;pel is, that if faith alone is the mean of ju&s;tification, it mu&s;t al&s;o be the whole of religion, and &s;o we will do nothing in obe|dience to the commands, only believe what CHRIST has done; and &s;o we are exactly at the religion which St. <HI>James</HI> had commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy. CHRIST by his obedience perfectly an&s;wered the law as a covenant of works, and &s;o paved the way for a &s;inner's accep|tance, when he relies &s;olely on that medium; con&s;e|quently, no matter who, or what the &s;inner is, who &s;o relies by faith, "though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live."&mdash;No matter how vile a per&s;on, or how great a &s;inner. But CHRIST did nothing to the law as a rule of common living for his people.&mdash;Con&s;equently, un|le&s;s they are holy, <HI>i. e.</HI> of ardent choice, ob&s;erve and obey the law in common life, it will prove they are not ju&s;tified; but that their faith is the dead &s;ort; for only by &s;uch works can their preten&s;ions to faith be ju&s;tified. If faith does not produce &s;uch works, 'tis dead, being <HI>alone, James,</HI> ii. 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE may in the la&s;t place make &s;ome inferences from what has been &s;aid, of tho&s;e who have living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="56" REF="009895_0055_0F7AD53059E31B10">1. YE did not acquire it.&mdash;"Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regenera|tion, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t," <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5. "Not for your &s;akes do I this, &s;aith the LORD GOD, be it known unto you: be a&s;hamed and confounded for your own ways," <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 32. A &s;ight of this makes and maintains humility; the want of it is the occa&s;ion and life of religious pride. And he who don't habitually &s;ee it, will &s;uffer by the latter; as he who does will be happy in the former.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD did not do all this for you, becau&s;e ye were better than others. The glory of GOD is the be&s;t ob|ject of de&s;ign for the creator, and all the creatures; this may be &s;ecured by his &s;aving the wor&s;t, rather than any other. With this view all &s;cripture exam|ples concur, as well as doctrines. There were many needy widows in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the time of the famine, but only to a heathen one, was <HI>Elijah</HI> &s;ent. Many le|pers al&s;o, but only to a <HI>Syrian</HI> was healing given, <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 25, 27. At this, they of the &s;ynagogue will always have wrath; but 'tis evident from the &s;crip|tures that real &s;infulne&s;s is <HI>no bar</HI> to the &s;alvation of him who believes the divine te&s;timony about CHRIST; though de&s;igned wickedne&s;s is always a qualification for hell. Con&s;equently, men's notions of their own goodne&s;s may prevent their &s;alvation, but their real badne&s;s, duly &s;een, cannot. Therefore they who are loaded down with &s;in and guilt, by coming to CHRIST, <HI>i. e.</HI> by believing the perfection of his merit with GOD, are welcome, <HI>Matth.</HI> xi. 28. And poor pub|licans, who can &s;ee nothing but badne&s;s about them, are accepted, rather than they who tru&s;t in them&s;elves that they are righteous, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 9 to 14. If there|fore we con&s;ider &s;aving grace as taking any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="57" REF="009895_0056_0F7AD530C9445C38">
from the &s;ubject, (which indeed it does not) it would be his &s;en&s;ible badne&s;s beyond any other. And to this agrees the pointed knowledge of fact in every child of GOD in the world. This was the ca&s;e with <HI>Paul,</HI> who &s;ays he was the pattern for them who &s;hould afterwards believe unto life, and it mu&s;t be &s;o in all, that GOD may have the glory of &s;aving &s;in|ners, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 15 to 17.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE don't maintain his kingdom in you becau&s;e you make good u&s;e of his grace. His favour could not turn on &s;uch a hinge if it was true, grace in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would lo&s;e both its name and nature. The fact is, he "worketh <HI>all</HI> our works in us," "both to will, and to do of his good plea&s;ure," <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 13; which is the apo&s;tle's grand argument on chri&s;tians to duty. Similar to which is that to <HI>Titus,</HI> ii. chap. 11 to 14. So that the believer is a debtor for every degree of faith, and for every duty thereby performed. There|fore <HI>James</HI> &s;ays, iv. chap. 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He giveth more grace, <HI>viz.</HI> to the humble, and thence takes his argument to urge all manner of duties in the following ver&s;es. For &s;ays <HI>John,</HI> i. chap. 16, "of his fulne&s;s have we all received," "and grace" to improve "grace."</P>
<P N="4">4. THE believer's province, is to endure, as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible. GOD is a &s;pirit, and &s;o his na|ture, and all his perfections are hidden to every eye among men, but that of faith. But of believers it is &s;aid, "we all, with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s" (a looking-gla&s;s which &s;hews the face truly, and clo&s;e at hand, &s;uch is the word of GOD to faith,) "the glory of the LORD, are changed into the &s;ame image." This beholding is of infinite u&s;e; it at|tracts and a&s;&s;imulates the beholder to the object; it &s;olves his &s;en&s;ual attachments; it attempers the &s;oul to holy employments, confirms it in obedience,
<PB N="58" REF="009895_0057_0F7AD53194805E08">
makes all the ways of wi&s;dom plea&s;ant; emboldens the &s;oul to hazardous enterprizes, &s;aying, "the LORD is at my right hand, I &s;hall not be moved," <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xvi. 8. It makes him &s;afe, "that he will fear no evil." Steadies him again&s;t all inferior frowns, or flatteries; furni&s;hes &s;uch equal relief, that the chri&s;tian language is "whom have I in heaven but GOD, and there is none on earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide him." And though faith always &s;ees that he is a con&s;uming fire, the &s;ight is &s;olemnly &s;weetened by this view, and is the argu|ment to hold fa&s;t, and &s;erve him acceptably, with re|verence and godly fear, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 28, 29. This view of divine glory, and its improvement, are peculiar to faith. This and every &s;ight of the glory of GOD, is in the light of that covenant, of which faith knows "he is ever mindful." Therefore his &s;everer atri|butes, are as &s;weetly precious as his milder ones, which is never the ca&s;e of any other faith. In this light, to true faith, GOD is all father, own father, natural father. Hence all the freedoms, all the ex|pectations, confidence, and &s;anctuary of believers. In the&s;e views alone the chri&s;tian can endure in both &s;erving and &s;uffering.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'TIS peculiar to a believer, in that character, to live in &s;ight of him&s;elf: "In thy light we &s;ee light." This &s;hews why faith can never make pride, but al|ways "hides pride from man;" and &s;o actual faith, and go&s;pel-humility mu&s;t be in&s;eparable. Hence a proud chri&s;tian is a natural fal&s;ehood. This clears the text, "he that tru&s;teth to his own heart is a fool; and cur&s;ed is he who maketh an arm of fle&s;h his tru&s;t." Nothing but faith can entirely &s;hut out boa&s;ting. "See&s;t thou a man wi&s;e in his own con|ceit, there is more hope of a fool than of him." Hence al&s;o &s;elf-loathing, &s;elf-renouncing, and &s;elf-denying
<PB N="59" REF="009895_0058_0F7AD5324A1F7228">
are peculiar, and perfectly natural to chri&s;|tianity. So the chri&s;tian's life mu&s;t be entirely a life of faith; and he mu&s;t know in full latitude that all his &s;prings are in GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. THEREFORE 'tis faith only, that can ever &s;ee, and habitually view JESUS CHRIST, as the bible repre|&s;ents him. No per&s;on but the believer can &s;ee all in GOD, and nothing in him&s;elf, therefore to none is he precious, but tho&s;e who believe; but to the&s;e no|thing can be more &s;o. A chri&s;tian, from what he &s;ees in GOD and knows of him&s;elf, &s;ees the mo&s;t ab&s;olute need of the righteou&s;ne&s;s and offices of JESUS CHRIST, in order that any of tho&s;e trea&s;ures, &s;hould flow to him. There is fulne&s;s of grace and glory, but how &s;hall a &s;inner get them? (for &s;uch the believer always &s;ees him&s;elf,) it can't be, but in a way that agrees to the nature of an unchanging GOD; and how can there be &s;uch a way, &s;ince his unchangeablene&s;s naturally &s;eals up de&s;pair to tho&s;e who have &s;inned? No way but through that atonement by means of which GOD is ju&s;t, while he ju&s;tifies the ungodly. This there|fore is the believing &s;inner's only refuge, only medium of hope, for pre&s;ent, or future, temporal or eternal goods. Of all the&s;e things his only account is in the bible, this makes the word of the LORD precious: And the only medium of actual communication is be|lieving that word; hence faith is called precious. By this the chri&s;tian con&s;tantly looks to GOD, con&s;i|dering him&s;elf a &s;inner, and as &s;uch having no right, but relying entirely on the truth of the word about the certain and perfect &s;atisfaction, fulne&s;s and grace of CHRIST, there &s;et forth to him; and in this way only, receives all &s;orts of mercies which he has from a covenant GOD; and to which he became entitled by the atonement which he believes as reported in
<PB N="60" REF="009895_0059_0F7AD533B900D988">
the word. And if he is &s;till needy and de&s;titute of any &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing, 'tis wholly becau&s;e he don't &s;o come for it, "for he that a&s;keth receiveth;" this is an ab&s;olute rule. And if he is de&s;titute of any tem|poral mercy, 'tis certainly either becau&s;e 'tis not good for him, at pre&s;ent, or becau&s;e he don't a&s;k for it. The latter is owing to &s;ome fal&s;e riches; in the other ca&s;e he can &s;ay without re&s;erve, "thy will de done."</P>
<P N="7">7. OF con&s;equence, a chri&s;tian mu&s;t be one who has the highe&s;t veneration for the plain language of the bible. If the bible tells him, that men, and even all orders among them, are "children of wrath by nature," and "dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins," with him, it &s;hall &s;tand for their moral character drawn by the direction of the Holy Gho&s;t. Let religious pride, enmity, and profanene&s;s join the oppo&s;ition; he has two &s;upports to his faith, one is divine report, the other is his own knowledge. The &s;ame upholds his heart again&s;t the empire of pride, in believing that we are, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, "without &s;trength," as to &s;elf-relief. If the bible teaches that we may be ju&s;tified by only believing what GOD has &s;aid, it &s;hall &s;tand with every one who is going to heaven, for the &s;aving article. If, in this affair, the word of GOD plainly excludes all manner of con&s;ideration for any thing done by men, he wrangles not one thought at it, for he has learned to believe whatever GOD &s;ays. If GOD has &s;aid, the whole of &s;alvation is of mere grace, he takes it without di&s;pute for a certainty. In &s;hort, whatever he finds the bible &s;ays, is in&s;tantly put beyond all debate, for he not only &s;ees it the mind of his Maker, and Redeemer, but the grand and mo&s;t &s;acred charter of all his hopes for time and eternity. Thus every chri&s;tian approves, delights in, e&s;teems, and to his power will maintain, what the
<PB N="61" REF="009895_0060_0F7AD533C96DB628">
plain bible tell him is the will of GOD. If CHRIST puts importance on every jot and tittle of his word, &s;o does his child, they have the &s;ame &s;pirit. And indeed this di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;heep from the goats. No per&s;on, but a believer, can in the divine &s;en&s;e, &s;ay "thy word is truth," or "thy word is the joy of my heart," any more than he can call JESUS, LORD, without the &s;pirit of GOD.</P>
<P N="8">8. THEN a believer is one who lives by faith. Though we are fallen &s;o far into the dreggs of RUIN, as that the TERM, <HI>believer,</HI> and the phra&s;e, <HI>live by faith,</HI> are become matters of common banter and &s;coff, epi|thets of reproach, and even the drunkard's &s;ong; yet &s;uch is the light of reality in which divine objects are &s;een and known by faith that in&s;tead of weaken|ing by &s;uch means, it waxes &s;tronger and &s;tronger; "this path of the ju&s;t is like a &s;hining light which &s;hineth more and more, 'till it" blazes "into perfect day."&mdash;And "the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t it." In front of all &s;orts of oppo&s;ition, a chri&s;tian believes the various and mighty evidences of a divine exi&s;tence, and is accordingly governed thereby, he lives as if there was a GOD, and &s;o his faith appears to be a rarity in the world. He believes what the &s;crip|tures &s;ay about the perfection of CHRIST'S righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and its de&s;ign to be the &s;ole ground of &s;inners tru&s;t; and his belief in this ca&s;e al&s;o governs him into &s;ingle dependance on it exclu&s;ively; he knows every good gift comes out of that font, to it therefore, all his views repair, and of its "fulne&s;s he receives, and grace for grace." He lives in &s;ight of the divinity of the bible, 'tis "the light of his feet, and a lamp to all his paths;" he believes it the &s;tated vehicle of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;o he hears it, reads it, feels it, and acts it out in common and divine life. He lives in &s;ight
<PB N="62" REF="009895_0061_0F7AD534894DCA48">
of uncertainty, and vanity, in all the things of this life; certainty and &s;ufficient reality in tho&s;e of ano|ther, in &s;ight of him&s;elf <HI>a &s;inner,</HI> and of CHRIST, as his "wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and ever|la&s;ting redemption." He &s;erves GOD, endures as &s;ee|ing him, and has a con&s;tant view to the recompence of reward. So his heart and life are governed by faith; he lives by the faith of the &s;on of GOD. Of con&s;equence,</P>
<P N="9">9. A TRUE believer is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others in that his works ju&s;tify his faith. 'Tis as peculiar to a true chri&s;tian to be governed by his belief, as it is to true faith to produce corre&s;pondent works. There is no way to &s;upport a claim to the chri&s;tian character, but by &s;criptural fruits of faith. If a per&s;on appears to be divinely governed by his faith, 'tis evidence enough to men, that he is born of GOD. And the want of this not only leaves no &s;uch evidence, but is evidence enough of the contrary. So that a per&s;on may always judge of him&s;elf, and on all the nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions be judged of by others, by the evident di|vine influence his religious faith has upon him. If chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors appear not to be governed by the chri&s;tian faith, 'tis evidence, let them have as much faith as they will, that 'tis of the dead &s;ort, and there|fore not operative:&mdash;"Faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone." If a mini&s;ter or a magi&s;trate, a parent or a child, a hu&s;band or a wife, a ma&s;ter or a &s;ervant, the youth or aged, who profe&s;s, or &s;ecretly think, they have the chri&s;tian belief, have not the ef|fects and fruits which the bible a&s;cribes to its faith, in forms plain enough to be under&s;tood by all who read or hear them, their faith is condemned, be|cau&s;e it don't make go&s;pel works. A grand de&s;ign of the bible is to &s;hew plainly to all the&s;e di&s;tinctions
<PB N="63" REF="009895_0062_0F7AD536CBCDDDA8">
of per&s;ons ju&s;t "what manner of per&s;ons, they ought to be;" that by its plain divine directions, "they may be thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good work," in their re&s;pective places; and there is in it a com|plete plain &s;et of in&s;tructions to all the&s;e &s;orts of per|&s;ons for this purpo&s;e, and nothing wanting. Now the&s;e in&s;tructions are <HI>believed</HI> or not; if <HI>believed,</HI> that belief will infallibly bring out tho&s;e very things in life; if then tho&s;e &s;ame things are not in life and con|ver&s;ation, 'tis certain they are not believed in the book; therefore, "by their fruits ye <HI>&s;hall know</HI> them," <HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 17 to 21. For whoever be|lieves the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the bible, will "be <HI>filled</HI> with the fruits of that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are by JESUS CHRIST to the glory and prai&s;e of GOD," <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 11. And they who don't &s;o believe, <HI>Jude</HI> &s;ays, "their fruit withers, they are without fruit, twice dead." To this purpo&s;e our Saviour &s;ays, <HI>Matth.</HI> xiii. 23, he who receives the &s;eed of the word into good ground, under&s;tands it, and bears fruit accord|ingly. From this, CHRIST takes his rule of judicial conduct to all under the go&s;pel; if they bear fruit an|&s;werable to their means, <HI>'tis well,</HI> but if not, they &s;hall be cut down as barren trees, <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 9. For he knows "every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and cannot bring forth evil fruit," and ju&s;t the con|trary is true of all the re&s;t, <HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 17, 18. Hence that remarkable &s;ummary of the whole affair, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> "We give thanks to GOD, &s;ince we heard of your faith in CHRIST, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the go&s;pel, which is come unto you,&mdash;and bringeth forth fruit&mdash;in you, &s;ince the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of GOD, in truth." Which makes the following things plain enough. <HI>&s;cil.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="64" REF="009895_0063_0F7AD53817F44360">(1.) THAT every per&s;on has his common character, as a candidate for eternity, with all the truths and duties which concern it, drawn before his eyes in the bible; and be&s;ide this, has his &s;pecial character, as mini&s;ter, magi&s;trate, hu&s;band, wife, parent, child, or any other in the world, drawn equally plain, with <HI>all</HI> the truths and duties which concern that al&s;o, in which he has the whole mind of GOD about him, in general and particular re&s;pects, and all he needs to be, and know and do.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT it is the whole duty, the happy privi|lege, and &s;o the &s;aving article, for each to believe the things, that, in his general or particular character, as much concern him, as peace of con&s;cience, accep|tance, daily acceptance with GOD, and eternal &s;alva|tion of his &s;oul concerns him.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THAT &s;uch as do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> believe them, will infal|libly be &s;uch in life and conduct, as the things re|&s;pecting them, &s;o believed, require they &s;hould be, and tend to make them. And con&s;equently, that &s;uch believing makes per&s;ons, in all their characters, ju&s;t &s;uch as the bible requires they &s;hould be; and the not &s;o believing is the univer&s;al rea&s;on why they remain unlike the bible in life and conduct; defec|tive and guilty in their places, and ripe for aggra|vated damnation.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THAT this, of con&s;equence, is the grand ma|nife&s;t di&s;tinction between true believers, and de|ceived ones.&mdash;"In this is manife&s;t the children of GOD, and the children of the devil: He that doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s, is not of GOD, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 10.</P>
<P N="10">10. AND la&s;tly.&mdash;The grand rea&s;on why all the&s;e things depend entirely and ab&s;olutely upon faith, is, that they may be perfectly free for any; as free for the wor&s;t as any. GOD is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons,
<PB N="65" REF="009895_0064_0F7AD538579CA1C8">
he would as &s;oon have a poor, de&s;pi&s;ed, or profane per|&s;on become a believer as any in the world; <HI>i. e.</HI> he has no regard to the world's greatne&s;s or men's good|ne&s;s. Tho&s;e who are already publicans and harlots, are as welcome, as kindly welcome to believe and live as any at all; nay, none are welcome 'till to their own knowledge they are as de&s;titute of goodne&s;s as tho&s;e: For CHRIST came not to call the righteous, but <HI>&s;inners</HI> to repentance; and has prepared de&s;truction for &s;uch as &s;in, that grace may abound. Now the whole bible witne&s;&s;es this freene&s;s of divine grace; but how could it be, unle&s;s faith alone were the means? The wor&s;t of men may believe what GOD tells them; but what goodne&s;s can they have to commend them to favour? and yet all the procla|mation is to &s;inners. He calls &s;inners; grace is of|fered to &s;inners, lo&s;t &s;inners, wretched, poor, blind, naked &s;inners, and for example gloriou&s;ly &s;aved <HI>Saul,</HI> the chief of them. They have no works at all but damning ones, but they can believe the go&s;pel ac|count of mercy brought by CHRIST, as well as any. And for this rea&s;on believing alone is the mean of acceptance with GOD.&mdash;"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promi&s;e," or matter of &s;alvation, "might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed," <HI>i. e.</HI> to all who believe, and &s;o appear to be of the elect, or &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> "not to that only which is of the law," <HI>i. e. Jewi&s;h</HI> believers, "but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of <HI>Abraham" i. e.</HI> are Gentiles, and &s;o have nothing el&s;e to depend upon but faith.&mdash;<HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 16.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equence of all this is,</P>
<P N="1">1 THEY who have notions of a good heart in them, or any thing about them plea&s;ing to GOD, without CHRIST, as received in faith, or in believing, can't be accepted.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="66" REF="009895_0065_0F7AD5390C0481F0">2. THAT their mouths will be &s;topped, and they all guilt before GOD at la&s;t, becau&s;e he did not require any point of per&s;onal goodne&s;s to commend them to his acceptance, but that they would believe his own account of grace and glory offered freely, and they would not.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT &s;uch as will believe his own account of CHRIST'S perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o &s;ee enough in it, and put their &s;ouls upon it, "&s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life;" however ba&s;e the per&s;on, or however great the &s;inner; and that for all the&s;e purpo&s;es the bible, its own Holy Gho&s;t, the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, &s;trength, and free grace of CHRIST are near enough.</P>
<P N="4">4. AND as a con&s;equent of all, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of divine conduct will be perfectly clear, in the cer|tain de&s;truction of all who were too righteous to &s;ub|mit to &s;alvation by faith, which rejects all per&s;onal goodne&s;s in ju&s;tification; and will be accordingly glo|rified by &s;aints and angels forever. And <HI>all</HI> his per|fections <HI>as</HI> glorious in the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who were de&s;titute enough of &s;elf-goodne&s;s to depend on <HI>mercy.</HI> And &s;o we find the ultimate de&s;ign of divine revela|tion, is, that they who will not believe perfect truth, may be made manife&s;t, and puni&s;hed an&s;werable to their contempt of divinity; and that they who be|lieve, and put them&s;elves on mercy, may not fail of the utmo&s;t perfection and happine&s;s of their natures by CHRIST; and &s;o GOD be glorious in all his works, through his only &s;on our LORD, forever and ever, AMEN.</P>
