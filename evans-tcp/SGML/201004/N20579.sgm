<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is already known to many, that Dr. Franklin amu&s;ed him&s;elf, towards the clo&s;e of his life, with writing memoirs of his own hi&s;|tory. The&s;e memoirs were brought down to the year 1757. To|gether with &s;ome other manu&s;cripts they were left behind him at his death, and were con&s;idered as con&s;tituting part of his po&s;thumous property. It is a little extraordinary that, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, intere&s;ting as they are, from the celebrity of the character of which they treat, and from the critical &s;ituation of the pre&s;ent times, they &s;hould &s;o long have been with-held from the Public: A tran&s;lation of them appeared in France near two years ago, coming down to the year 1731. There can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on, that what has thus been &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of Europe, &s;hould not be made acce&s;|&s;ible to tho&s;e to whom Dr. Franklin's language is native. The fir&s;t part of the hi&s;tory of his life is tran&s;lated from that publication.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of the&s;e memoirs is uncommonly plea&s;ing. The &s;tory is told with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved &s;incerity, and without any fal&s;e co|louring or ornament. We &s;ee, in every page, that the author exam|ined his &s;ubject with the eye of a ma&s;ter, and related no incidents, the &s;prings and origin of which he did not perfectly under&s;tand. It is this that gives &s;uch exqui&s;ite and uncommon per&s;picuity to the de|tail and delight in the review. The tran&s;lator has endeavoured, as he went along, to conceive the probable manner in which Dr. Franklin expre&s;&s;ed his ideas in his Engli&s;h manu&s;cript, and he hopes to be forgiven if this enquiry &s;hall occa&s;ionally have &s;ubjected him to the charge of a &s;tyle in any re&s;pect bald or low: to imitate the admira|ble &s;implicity of the author, is no ea&s;y ta&s;k.</P>
<P>The public will be amu&s;ed with following a great philo&s;opher in relaxations, and ob&s;erving in what re&s;pects his philo&s;ophy tends to elucidate and improve the mo&s;t common &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The editor &s;ubjoins a letter from the late celebrated and amiable Dr. Price, to a gentleman in Philadelphia, upon the &s;ubject of Dr. Franklin's memoirs of his own life.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM hardly able to tell you how kindly I take the letters with which you favour me. Your la&s;t, containing an account of the death of our excellent friend Dr. Frankling, and the circum&s;tances attend|ing it, de&s;erves my particular gratitude. The account which he has left of his life will &s;how, in a &s;triking example, how a man, by tal|ents,
<PB N="iv" REF="027004_0004_0FD2D7A65FA64B80">indu&s;try, and integrity, may ri&s;e from ob&s;curity to the fir&s;t eminence and con&s;equence in the world; but it brings his hi&s;tory no lower than the year 1757, and I under&s;tand that &s;ince he &s;ent over the copy, which I have read, he has been able to make no additions to it. It is with a melancholy regret I think of his death; but to death we are all bound by the irrever&s;ible order of nature, and in looking forward to it, there is comfort in being able to reflect&mdash;that we have not lived in vain, and that all the u&s;eful and virtuous &s;hall meet in a better country beyond the grave.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin, in the la&s;t letter I received from him, after men|tioning his age and infirmities, ob&s;erves, that it has been kindly or|dered by the Author of nature, that, as we draw nearer the conclu|&s;ion of life, we are furni&s;hed with more helps to wean us from it, among which one of the &s;tronge&s;t is the lo&s;s of dear friends. I was delighted with the account you gave in your letter of the honour &s;hewn to his memory at Philadelphia, and by Congre&s;s; and ye&s;ter|day I received a high additional plea&s;ure, by being informed that the National A&s;&s;embly of France had determined to go in mourning for him.&mdash;What a glorious &s;cene is opened there! The annals of the world furni&s;h no parallel to it. One of the honours of our departed friend is, that he has contributed much to it.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF DR. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</HEAD>
<P>MY DEAR SON,</P>
<P>I HAVE amu&s;ed my&s;elf with collecting &s;ome little anecdotes of my family. You may remember the enquiries I made, when you were with me in England, among &s;uch of my relations as were then living; and the journey I undertook for that purpo&s;e. To be acquainted with the particulars of my pa|rentage and life, many of which are unknown to you; I flatter my&s;elf, will afford the &s;ame plea&s;ure to you as to me. I &s;hall relate them upon paper: it will be an agreeable employ|ment of a week's uninterrupted lea&s;ure, which I promi&s;e my&s;elf during my pre&s;ent retire|ment in the country. There are al&s;o other motives which induce me to the undertaking. From the bo&s;om of poverty and ob&s;curity, in which I drew my fir&s;t breath and &s;pent my earlie&s;t years, I have rai&s;ed my&s;elf to a &s;tate of opulence and to &s;ome degree of celebrity in the world. A con&s;tant good fortune has
<PB N="6" REF="027004_0006_0FD2D7AF335B1070">attended me through every period of life to my pre&s;ent advanced age; and my de&s;cend|ants may be de&s;irous of learning what were the means of which I made u&s;e, and which, thanks to the a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand of Providence, have proved &s;o eminently &s;ucce&s;sful. They may al&s;o, &s;hould they ever be placed in a &s;i|milar &s;ituation, derive &s;ome advantage from my narrative.</P>
<P>When I reflect, as I frequently do, upon the felicity I have enjoyed, I &s;ometimes &s;ay to my&s;elf, that, were the offer made me, I would engage to run again, from beginning to end, the &s;ame career of life. All I would a&s;k &s;hould be the privilege of an author, to correct, in a &s;econd edition, certain errors of the fir&s;t. I could wi&s;h, likewi&s;e, if it were in my power, to change &s;ome trivial inci|dents and events for others more favourable. Were this however denied me, &s;till would I not decline the offer. But &s;ince a repetition of life cannot take place, there is nothing which, in my opinion, &s;o nearly re&s;embles it, as to call to mind all its circum&s;tances, and, to render their remembrance more durable, commit them to writing. By thus employing my&s;elf, I &s;hall yield to the inclination, &s;o natural to old men, to talk of them&s;elves and their exploits, and may freely follow my bent, without being tire&s;ome to tho&s;e who, from re&s;pect to my age, might think them|&s;elves obliged to li&s;ten to me; as they will be at liberty, to read me or not as they plea&s;e. In
<PB N="7" REF="027004_0007_0FD2D846CBC9E608">fine&mdash;and I may well avow it, &s;ince nobody would believe me were I to deny it&mdash;I &s;hall perhaps, by this employment, gratify my vanity. Scarcely indeed have I ever heard or read the introductory phra&s;e, <HI>"I may &s;ay without vanity,"</HI> but &s;ome &s;triking and cha|racteri&s;tic in&s;tance of vanity has immediately followed. The generality of men hate vani|ty in others, however &s;trongly they may be tinctured with it them&s;elves; for my&s;elf, I pay obei&s;ance to it wherever I meet with it, per&s;uaded that it is advantageous, as well to the individual it governs, as to tho&s;e who are within the &s;phere of its influence. Of con|&s;equence, it would, in many ca&s;es, not be wholly ab&s;urd, that a man &s;hould count his vanity among the other &s;weets of life, and give thanks to Providence for the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>And here let me with all humility acknow|ledge, that to Divine Providence I am in|debted for the felicity I have hitherto enjoy|ed. It is that power alone which has furni&s;hed me with the means I have employed, and that has crowned them with &s;ucce&s;s My faith in this re&s;pect leads me to hope, though I can|not count upon it, that the divine goodne&s;s will &s;till be exerci&s;ed towards me, either by prolonging the duration of my happine&s;s to the clo&s;e of life, or by giving me fortitude to &s;upport any melancholy rever&s;e, which may happen to me, as to &s;o many others. My future fortune is unknown but to him in
<PB N="8" REF="027004_0008_0FD2D7B20BAE9DA8">who&s;e hand is our de&s;tiny, and who can make our very afflictions &s;ub&s;ervient to our benefit.</P>
<P>One of my uncles, de&s;irous like my&s;elf, of collecting anecdotes of our family, gave me &s;ome notes, from which I have derived many particulars re&s;pecting our ance&s;tors. From the&s;e I learn, that they had lived in the &s;ame village (Eaton in Northampton&s;hire) upon a freehold of about thirty acres, for the &s;pace at lea&s;t of three hundred years. How long they had re&s;ided there prior to that pe|riod, my uncle had been unable to di&s;cover; probably ever &s;ince the in&s;titution of &s;ur|names, when they took the appellation of Franklin, which had formerly been the name of a particular order of individuals <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As a proof that Franklin was anciently the com|mon name of an order or rank in England, &s;ee Judge Forte&s;cue, <HI>De l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> dio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s legum Angliae,</HI> written about the year 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2 in which is the following pa&s;&s;age, to &s;hew that good juries might ea&s;ily be formed in any part of England.</P>

<P>This petty e&s;tate would not have &s;ufficed for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, had they not added the trade of black&s;mith, which was perpetuated in the family down to my uncle's time, the elde&s;t &s;on having been uniformly brought up to this employment: a cu&s;tom which both he and my father ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to their elde&s;t &s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="027004_0009_0FD2D848928A5298">
In the re&s;earches I made at Eaton, I found no account of their births, marriages, and deaths, earlier than the year 1555; the par|i&s;h regi&s;ter not extending farther back than that period. This regi&s;ter informed me, that I was the younge&s;t &s;on of the younge&s;t branch of the family, counting five generations. My grandfather, Thomas, who was born in 1598, living at Eaton till he was too old to conti|nue his trade, when he retired to Banbury in Oxford&s;hire, where his &s;on John, who was a dyer, re&s;ided, and with whom my father was apprenticed. He died, and was buried there: we &s;aw his monument in 1758. His elde&s;t &s;on lived in the family hou&s;e at Eaton,
<PB N="10" REF="027004_0010_0FD2D7B302FB6D80">which be bequeathed, with the land belong|ing to it, to his only daughter; who, in con|cert with her hu&s;band, Mr. Fi&s;her of Wel|lingborough, afterwards &s;old it to Mr. E&s;ted, the pre&s;ent proprietor.</P>
<P>My grandfather had four &s;urviving &s;ons, Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Jo&s;ias. I &s;hall give you &s;uch particulars of them as my mem|ory will furni&s;h, not having my papers here, in which you will find a more minute account, if they are not lo&s;t during my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Thomas had learned the trade of black|&s;mith under his father; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a good natural under&s;tanding, he improved it by &s;tu|dy, at the &s;olicitation of a gentleman of the name of Palmer, who was at that time the principal inhabitant of the village, and who en|couraged in like manner all my uncles to im|prove their minds. Thomas thus rendered him|&s;elf competent to the functions of a country attorney; &s;oon became an e&s;&s;ential per&s;onage in the affairs of the village; and was one of the chief movers of every public enterprize, as well relative to the country as the town of Northampton. A variety of remarkable in|cidents were told us of him at Eaton. After enjoying the e&s;teem and patronage of Lord Halifax, he died, January 6, 1702, preci&s;e|ly four years before I was born. The recit|al that was made us of his life and character, by &s;ome aged per&s;ons of the village, &s;truck you, I remember, as extraordinary, from its analogy to what you knew of my&s;elf "Had
<PB N="11" REF="027004_0011_0FD2D849C26766F8">he died," &s;aid you, "ju&s;t four years later, one might have &s;uppo&s;ed a tran&s;migration of &s;ouls."</P>
<P>John, to the be&s;t of my belief, was brought up to the trade of a wool-dyer.</P>
<P>Benjamin &s;erved his apprentice&s;hip in Lon|don to a &s;ilk-dyer. He was an indu&s;trious man: I remember him well; for, while I was a child, he joined my father at Bo&s;ton, and lived for &s;ome years in the hou&s;e with us. A particular affection had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween my father and him; and I was his god|&s;on. He arrived to a great age. He left be|hind him two quarto volumes of poems in ma|nu&s;&s;cript, con&s;i&s;ting of little fugitive pieces ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his friends. He had invented a &s;horthand, which he taught me, but having never made u&s;e of it, I have now forgotten it. He was a man of piety, and a con&s;tant at|tendant on the be&s;t preachers, who&s;e &s;ermons he took a plea&s;ure in writing down accord|ing to the expeditory method he had devi&s;ed. Many volumes were thus collected by him. He was al&s;o extremely fond of politics, too much &s;o perhaps for his &s;ituation. I lately found in London a collection which he had made of all the principal pamphlets relative to public affairs, from the year 1641 to 1717. Many volumes are wanting, as appears by the &s;eries of numbers; but there &s;till remain eight in folio, and twenty four in quarto and octavo. The collection had fallen into the hands of a &s;econd-hand book&s;eller, who, knowing me by
<PB N="12" REF="027004_0012_0FD2D7B476804928">having &s;old me &s;ome books, brought it to me. My uncle, it &s;eems, had left it behind him on his departure for America, about fifty years ago. I found various notes of his writing in the margins. His grand&s;on, Samuel, is now living at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Our humble family had early embraced the Reformation. They remained faithfully at|tached during the reign of Queen Mary, when they were in danger of being mole&s;ted on account of their zeal again&s;t popery. They had an Engli&s;h Bible, and, to conceal it the more &s;ecure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, they conceived the pro|ject of fa&s;tening it, open, with pack-thread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> acro&s;s the leaves, on the in&s;ide of the lid of a clo&s;e-&s;tool. When my great-grandfather wi&s;h|ed to read to his family, he rever&s;ed the lid of the clo&s;e-&s;tool upon his knees, and pa&s;&s;ed the leaves from one &s;ide to the other, which were held down on each by the pack-thread. One of the children was &s;tationed at the door, to give notice if he &s;aw the proctor (an offi|cer of the &s;piritual court) make his appear|ance: in that ca&s;e, the lid was re&s;tored to its place, with the Bible concealed under it as before. I had this anecdote from my uncle Benjamin.</P>
<P>The whole family pre&s;erved its attachment to the Church of England till towards the clo&s;e of the reign of Charles II. when certain mini&s;ters, who had been ejected as non-con|formi&s;ts, having held conventicles in North|hampton&s;hire, they were joined by Benjamin
<PB N="13" REF="027004_0013_0FD2D84B48B3A940">and Jo&s;ias, who adhered to them over after. The re&s;t of the family continued in the epi&s;|copal church.</P>
<P>My father, Jo&s;ias, married early in life. He went with his wife and three children, to New-England, about the year 1682. Con|venticles being at that time prohibited by law, and frequently di&s;turbed, &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;ons of his acquaintance determined to go to America, where they hoped to enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and my father was prevailed on to accompany them.</P>
<P>My father had al&s;o by the &s;ame wife four children born in America, and ten others by a &s;econd wife, making in all &s;eventeen. I re|member to have &s;een thirteen &s;eated together at his table, who all arrived to years of ma|turity, and were married. I was the la&s;t of the &s;ons, and the younge&s;t child, excepting two daughters. I was born at Bo&s;ton in New-England. My mother, the &s;econd wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts of New-England, of whom Cotton Mather makes honourable men|tion, in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of that prov|ince, as <HI>"a pious learned Engli&s;hman,"</HI> if I rightly recollect his expre&s;&s;ions. I have been told of his having written a variety of little pieces; but there appears to be only one in print, which I met with many years ago. It was publi&s;hed in the year 1675, and is in fami|liar ver&s;e, agreeable to the ta&s;t of the times and the country. The author addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf
<PB N="14" REF="027004_0014_0FD2D7B6214AEB30">to the governors for the time being, &s;peaks for liberty of con&s;cience, and in favour of the anabapti&s;ts, quakers and other &s;ectaries, who had &s;uffered per&s;ecution. To this per&s;e|cution he attributes the wars with the natives, and other calamities which afflicted the coun|try, regarding them as the judgments of God in puni&s;hment of &s;o odious an offence, and he exhorts the government to the repeal of laws &s;o contrary to charity. The poem appeared to be written with a manly freedom and a plea&s;ing &s;implicity. I recollect the &s;ix con|cluding lines, though I have forgotten the order of words of the two fir&s;t; the &s;en&s;e of which was, that his cen&s;ures were dictated by benevolence, and that, of con&s;equence, he wi&s;hed to be known as the author; becau&s;e &s;aid he, I hate from my very &s;oul di&s;&s;imula|tion;
<Q><L>From Sherburne,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Town in the I&s;land of Nantucket.</NOTE> where I dwell,</L>
<L>I therefore put my name,</L>
<L>Your friend, who means you well,</L>
<BIBL>PETER FOLGER.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>My brothers were all put apprentice to different trades. With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I was &s;ent, at the age of eight years, to a grammar &s;chool. My father de&s;tined me for the church, and already regarded me as the chaplain of the family. The promptitude with which from my infancy I had learned to read, for I do not remember to have been
<PB N="15" REF="027004_0015_0FD2D84DA16EFD90">ever without this acquirement, and the en|couragement of his friends, who a&s;&s;ured him that I &s;hould one day certainly become a man of letters, confirmed him in this de&s;ign. My uncle Benjamin approved al&s;o of the &s;cheme, and promi&s;ed to give me all his volumes of &s;ermons, written, as I have &s;aid, in the &s;hort|hand of his invention, if I would take the pains to learn it.</P>
<P>I remained however &s;carcely a year at grammar-&s;chool, although, in this &s;hort in|terval, I had ri&s;en from the middle to the head of my cla&s;s, from thence to the cla&s;s immediately above, and was to pa&s;s, at the end of the year, to the one next in order. But my father, burthened with a numerous family, found that he was incapable, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to difficulties, of providing for the expence of a collegiate education; and con&s;idering be&s;ides, as I heard him &s;ay to his friends, that per&s;ons &s;o educated were often poorly provided for, he renounced his fir&s;t intentions, took me from the grammar-&s;chool, and &s;ent me to a &s;chool for writing and arithmetic, kept by a Mr. George Brown|wel, who was a &s;kilful ma&s;ter, and &s;ucceeded very well in his profe&s;&s;ion by employing gen|tle means only, and &s;uch as were calculated to encourage his &s;cholars. Under him I &s;oon acquired an excellent hand; but I failed in arithmetic, and made therein no &s;ort of pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>At ten years of age, I was called home to

I was ac|cordingly employed in cutting the wicks, fill|ing the moulds, taking care of the &s;hop, car|rying me&s;&s;ages, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed me, and I felt a &s;trong inclination for a &s;ea life; but my fa|ther &s;et his face again&s;t it. The vicinity of the water, however, gave me frequent op|portunities of venturing my&s;elf both upon and within it, and I &s;oon acquired the art of &s;wimming, and of managing a boat.&mdash;When embarked with other children, the helm was commonly deputed to me, particularly on difficult occa&s;ions; and, in every other pro|ject, I was a almo&s;t always the leader of the troop, whom I &s;ometimes involved in em|barra&s;&s;ments. I &s;hall give an in&s;tance of this, which demon&s;trates an early di&s;po&s;ition of mind for public enterpri&s;e, though the one in que&s;tion was not conducted by ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The mill-pond was terminated on one &s;ide by a mar&s;h, upon the borders of which we were accu&s;tomed to take our &s;tand, at high water, to angle for &s;mall fi&s;h. By dint of walking, we had converted the place into a perfect quagmire. My propo&s;al was to erect a wharf that &s;hould afford us firm footing
<PB N="17" REF="027004_0017_0FD2D84F33755318">and I pointed out to my companions a large heap of &s;tones, intended for building a new hou&s;e near the mar&s;h, and which were well adapted for our purpo&s;e. Accordingly, when the workmen retired in the evening, I a&s;&s;em|bled a number of my play<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellows, and by labouring diligently, like ants, &s;ometimes four of us uniting our &s;trength to carry a &s;ingle &s;tone, we removed them all, and con|&s;tructed our little quay. The workmen were &s;urpri&s;ed the next morning at not finding their &s;tones, which had been conveyed to our wharf. Enquiries were made re&s;pecting the authors of this conveyance; we were di&s;co|vered; complaints were exhibited again&s;t us; many of us underwent correction on the part of our parents; and though I &s;trenuou&s;ly defended the utility of the work, my father at length convinced me, that nothing which was not &s;trictly hone&s;t could be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>It will not, perhaps, be unintere&s;ting to you to know what &s;ort of a man my father was. He had an excellent con&s;titution, was of a middle &s;ize, but well made and &s;trong, and extremely active in whatever he under|took. He de&s;igned with a degree of neat|ne&s;s, and knew a little of mu&s;ic. His voice was &s;onorous and agreeable; &s;o that when he &s;ung a p&s;alm or hymn with accompaniment of his violin, as was his frequent practice in an evening when the labours of the day were fini&s;hed, it was truly delightful to hear him. He was ver&s;ed al&s;o in mechanics, and could
<PB N="18" REF="027004_0018_0FD2D820534F1998">upon occa&s;ion, u&s;e the tools of a variety of trades. But his greate&s;t excellence was a &s;ound under&s;tanding and &s;olid judgment in matters of prudence, both in public and pri|vate life. In the former indeed he never en|gaged, becau&s;e his numerous family and the mediocrity of his fortune, kept him unre|mittingly employed in the duties of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion. But I very well remember that the leading men of the place u&s;ed frequently to come and a&s;k his advice re&s;pecting affairs of the town, or of the church to which he be|longed, and that they paid much difference to his opinion. Individuals were al&s;o in the habit of con&s;ulting him in their private af|fairs, and he was often cho&s;en arbiter between contending parties.</P>
<P>He was fond of having at his table, as of|ten as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome friends or well-informed neighbours capable of rational conver&s;ation, and he was always careful to introduce u&s;eful or ingenious topics of di&s;cour&s;e, which might tend to form the minds of his children. By this means he early attracted our attention to what was ju&s;t, prudent, and beneficial in the conduct of life. He never talked of the meats which appeared upon the table, never di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed whether they were well or ill dre&s;&s;ed, of a good or bad flavour, high-&s;ea&s;oned or otherwi&s;e, preferable or inferior to this or that di&s;h of a &s;imilar kind. Thus accu&s;tomed, from my infancy, to the utmo&s;t inattention as to the&s;e objects, I have always been per|fectly
<PB N="19" REF="027004_0019_0FD2D8508BF13C58">regardle&s;s of what kind of food was before me; and I pay &s;o little attention to it even now, that it would be a hard matter for me to recollect, a few hours after I had dined, of what my dinner had con&s;i&s;ted. When tra|velling, I have particularly experienced the advantage of this habit; for it has often hap|pened to me to be in company with per&s;ons, who, having a more delicate, becau&s;e a more exerci&s;ed ta&s;te, have &s;uffered in many ca&s;es con&s;iderable inconvenience; while, as to my|&s;elf, I have had nothing to de&s;ire.</P>
<P>My mother was likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ex|cellent con&s;titution. She &s;uckled all her ten children, and I never heard either her or my father complain of any other di&s;order, than that of which they died: my father at the age of eighty-&s;even, and my mother at eighty-five. They are buried at Bo&s;ton, where, a few years ago, I placed a marble over their grave, with this in&s;cription:
<Q>Here lie JOSIAS FRANKLIN and ABIAH his wife: They lived together with reciprocal affec|tion for fifty-nine years; and without private fortune, without lucrative employ|ment, by a&s;&s;iduous labour and hone&s;t in|du&s;try, decently &s;upported a numerous family, and educated, with &s;ucce&s;s, thir|teen children, and &s;even grand-children. Let this example, reader, encourage thee diligently to di&s;charge the duties of thy cal|ling,

<P>I perceive, by my rambling digre&s;&s;ions, that I am growing old. But we do not dre&s;s for a private company as for a formal ball. This de&s;erves perhaps the name of negligence.</P>
<P>To return. I thus continued employed in my father's trade for the &s;pace of two years; that is to &s;ay, till I arrived at twelve years of age. About this time my brother John, who had &s;erved his apprentice&s;hip in London, ha|ving quitted my father, and being married and &s;ettled in bu&s;ine&s;s on his own account at Rhode-I&s;land, I was de&s;tined, to all appear|ance, to &s;upply his place, and be a candle-maker all my life: but my di&s;like of this oc|cupation continuing, my father was apprehen|&s;ive, that, if a more agreeable one were not offered me, I might play the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t and e&s;cape to &s;ea; as, to his extreme mortification, my brother Jo&s;ias had done. He therefore took me &s;ometimes to &s;ee ma&s;ons, coopers, brazi|ers, joiners, and other mechanics, employed at their work; in order to di&s;cover the bent of my inclination, and fix it if he could upon &s;ome occupation that might retain me on &s;hore. I have &s;ince, in con&s;equence of tho&s;e vi&s;its, derived no &s;mall plea&s;ure from &s;eeing
<PB N="21" REF="027004_0021_0FD2D854C0A5D138">&s;kilful workmen handle their tools; and it has proved of con&s;iderable benefit, to have ac|quired thereby &s;ufficient knowledge to be able to make little things for my&s;elf, when I have had no mechanic at hand, and to con&s;truct &s;mall machines for my experiments, while the idea I have conceived has been fre&s;h and &s;trong|ly impre&s;&s;ed on my imagination.</P>
<P>My father at length decided that I &s;hould be a cutler, and I was placed for &s;ome days upon trial with my cou&s;in Samuel, &s;on of my uncle Benjamin, who had learned this trade in London, and had e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at Bo&s;t|on. But the premium he required for my ap|prentice&s;hip di&s;plea&s;ing my father, I was recal|led home.</P>
<P>From my earlie&s;t years I had been pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of reading, and I laid out in books all the little money I could procure. I was particularly plea&s;ed with accounts of voyages. My fir&s;t acqui&s;ition was Bunyan's collection in &s;mall &s;eparate volumes. The&s;e I afterwards &s;old in order to buy an hi&s;torical collection by R. Burton, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall cheap volumes, amounting in all to about forty or fifty. My father's little library was principal|ly made up of books of practical and polem|ical theology. I read the greate&s;t part of them. I have &s;ince often regretted, that at a time when I had &s;o great a thir&s;t for knowledge, more eligible books had not fallen into my hands, as it was then a point decided that I &s;hould not be educated for the church. There was al&s;o among my father's books <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lutarch's
<PB N="22" REF="027004_0022_0FD2D822B8C5A930">L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves in which I read continually, and I &s;till regard as advantageou&s;ly employed the time I devoted to them. I found be&s;ides a work of De Fou's, entitled, and E&s;&s;ay on Projects, from which, perhaps, I derived impre&s;&s;ions that have &s;ince influenced &s;ome of the princi|pal events of my life.</P>
<P>My inclination for books at la&s;t determin|ed my father to make me a printer, though he had already a &s;on in that profe&s;&s;ion. My brother had returned from England in 1717, with a pre&s;s and types, in order too e&s;tabli&s;h a printing-hou&s;e at Bo&s;ton. This bu&s;ine&s;s plea|&s;ed me much better than that of my father, though I had &s;till a predilection for the &s;ea. To prevent the effects which might re&s;ult from this inclination, my father was impatient to &s;ee the engaged with my brother. I held ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for &s;ome time; at length however I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be per&s;uaded, and &s;igned my inden|tures, being then only twelve years of age. It was agreed that I &s;hould &s;erve as appren|tice to the age of twenty-one, and &s;hould re|ceive jorneyman's wages only during the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time I made great proficien|cy in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and became very &s;ervicea|ble to my brother. I had now an opportunity of procuring better books. The acquaint|ance I nece&s;&s;arily formed with book&s;eller's ap|prentices, enabled me to borrow a volume now and then, which I never failed to return punctually and without injury. How often
<PB N="23" REF="027004_0023_0FD2D8582B8A5CC0">has it happened to me to pa&s;s the greater part of the night in reading by my bed-&s;ide, when the book had been lent me in the evening, and was to be returned the next morning, le&s;t it might be mi&s;&s;ed or wanted.</P>
<P>At length, Mr. Matthew Adams, an inge|nious trade&s;man, who had a hand&s;ome col|lection of books, and who frequented our printing-hou&s;e, took notice of me. He in|vited me to &s;ee his library, and had the goodne&s;s to lend me any books I was de&s;irous of reading. I then took a &s;trange fancy for poetry, and compo&s;ed &s;everal little pieces. My brother, thinking he might find his ac|count in it, encouraged me, and engaged me to write two ballads. One, called the Light|hou&s;e Tragedy, contained an account of the &s;hipwreck of captain Worthilake and his two daughters; the other was a &s;ailor's &s;ong on the capture of the noted pirate called <HI>Teach,</HI> or <HI>Black-beard.</HI> They were wreched ver&s;es in point of &s;tyle, mere blind-men's ditties. When printed, he di&s;patched me about the town to &s;ell them. The fir&s;t had a prodig|ious run, becau&s;e the event was recent, and had made a great noi&s;e.</P>
<P>My vanity was flattered by this &s;ucce&s;s; but my father checked my exultation, by ridicu|ling my productions, and telling me that ver|&s;ifiers were always poor. I thus e&s;caped the misfortune of being, probably, a very wretch|ed poet&punc; but as the faculty of writing pro&s;e has been of great &s;ervice to me in the cour&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="027004_0024_0FD2D8244C2BCC88">of my life, and principally contributed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> advancement, I &s;hall relate by what mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ituated as I was, I acquired the &s;mall &s;kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may po&s;&s;e&s;s in that way.</P>
<P>There was in the town another young man, a great lover of books, of the name of John Collins, with whom I was intimately connect|ed. We frequently engaged in di&s;pute, and were indeed &s;o fond of argumentation, that nothing, was &s;o agreeable to us as a war <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> words. This contentious temper, I would ob&s;erve by the bye, is in danger of becoming a very bad habit, and frequently renders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a man's company in&s;upportable, as being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> otherwi&s;e capable of indulgence than by in|di&s;criminate contradiction. Independently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the acrimony and di&s;cord it introduces in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> conver&s;ation, it is often productive of di&s;like and even hatred, between per&s;ons to who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> friend&s;hip is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. I acqui|red it by reading, while I lived with my fa|ther, books of religious controver&s;y. I have &s;ince remarked, that men of &s;en&s;e &s;eldom fall into this error; lawyers, fellows of universi|ties, and per&s;ons of every profe&s;&s;ion educated at Edinburgh, excepted.</P>
<P>Collins and I one day in an argument relative to the education of women; namely whether it were proper to in&s;truct them in the &s;ciences, and whether they were compete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the &s;tudy.

I maintained the oppo&s;ite opinion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="25" REF="027004_0025_0FD2D859AD7A1318">little perhaps for the plea&s;ure of di&s;puting. He was naturally more eloquent than I; words flowed copiou&s;ly from his lips; and frequent|ly I thought my&s;elf vanqui&s;hed, more by his volubility than by the force of his arguments. We &s;eparated without coming to an agreement upon this point; and as we were not to &s;ee each other again for &s;ome time, I committed my thoughts to paper, made a fair copy, and &s;ent it him. He an&s;wered, and I replied. Three or four letters had been written by each, when my father chanced to light upon my papers and read them. Without entering into the merits of the cau&s;e, he embraced the oppor|tunity of &s;peaking to me upon my manner of writing. He ob&s;erved, that though I had the advantage of my adver&s;ary in correct &s;pelling and pointing, which I owed to my occupation, I was greatly his inferior in elegance of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, in arrangement, and per&s;picuity. Of this he convinced me by &s;everal examples. I felt the ju&s;tice of his remarks, became more attentive to language, and re&s;olved to make every effort to improve my &s;tyle. Amid&s;t the&s;e re&s;olves an odd volume of the Spectator fell into my hands. This was a publication I had never &s;een. I bought the volume, and read it again and again. I was enchanted with it, thought the &s;tyle excellent, and wi&s;hed it were in my power to imitate it. With this view I &s;elected &s;ome of the papers, made &s;hort &s;ummaries of the &s;en&s;e of each period, and put them for a few days a&s;ide. I then, with|out
<PB N="26" REF="027004_0026_0FD2D82620B46020">looking at the book, endeavoured to re|&s;tore the e&s;&s;ays to their true form, and to ex|pre&s;s each thought at length, as it was in the original, employing the mo&s;t appropriate words that occurred to my mind. I afterwards com|pared my Spectator with the original; I per|ceived &s;ome faults, which I corrected: but I found that I wanted a fund of words, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, and a facility of recollect|ing and employing them, which I thought I &s;hould by that time have acquired, had I con|tinued to make ver&s;es. The continual need of words of the &s;ame meaning, but of differ|ent lengths for the mea&s;ure, or of different &s;ounds for the rhyme, would have obliged me to &s;eek for a variety of &s;ynonymes, and have rendered me ma&s;ter of them. From this be|lief, I took &s;ome of the tales of the Specta|tor, and turned them into ver&s;e; and after a time, when I had &s;ufficiently forgotten them, I again converted them into pro&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o I mingled all my &s;ummaries together; and a few weeks after, endeavoured to arrange them in the be&s;t order, before I attempted to form the periods and complete the e&s;&s;ays. This I did with a view of acquir|ing method in the arrangement of my thoughts. On comparing afterwards my per|formance with the original, many faults were apparent, which I corrected; but I had &s;ome|times the &s;atisfaction to think, that, in cer|tain particulars of little importance, I had been fortunate enough to improve the order
<PB N="27" REF="027004_0027_0FD2D85E1263CB50">of thought or the &s;tyle; and this encouraged me to hope that I &s;hould &s;ucceed, in time, in writing the Engli&s;h language, which was one of the great objects of my ambition.</P>
<P>The time which I devoted to the&s;e exerci&s;es, and to reading, was the evening after my day's labour was fini&s;hed, the morning before it began, and Sundays when I could e&s;cape attending divine &s;ervice. While I lived with my father, he had in&s;i&s;ted on my punctual attendance on public wor&s;hip, and I &s;till in|deed con&s;idered it as a duty, but a duty which I thought I had no time to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>When about &s;ixteen years of age, a work of Tryon fell into my hands, in which he re|commends vegetable diet. I determined to ob&s;erve it. My brother, being a bachelor, did not keep hou&s;e, but boarded with his ap|prentices in a neighbouring family. My re|fu&s;ing to eat animal food was found inconve|nient, and I was often &s;colded for my &s;ingu|larity. I attended to the mode in which Tryon prepared &s;ome of his di&s;hes, particu|larly how to boil potatoes and rice, and make ha&s;ty puddings. I then &s;aid to my brother, that if he would allow me per week half what he paid for my board, I would under|take to maintain my&s;elf. The offer was in|&s;tantly embraced, and I &s;oon found that of what he gave me I was able to &s;ave half. This was a new fund for the purcha&s;e of books; and other advantages re&s;ulted to me from the plan. When my brother and his
<PB N="28" REF="027004_0028_0FD2D82736131420">workmen left the printing-hou&s;e to go to din|ner, I remained behind; and di&s;patched my frugal meal, which frequently con&s;i&s;ted of a bi&s;cuit only, or a &s;lice of bread and a bunch of rai&s;ins, or a bun from the pa&s;try cook's, with a gla&s;s of water, I had the re&s;t of the time, till their return, for &s;tudy; and my progre&s;s therein was proportioned to that clearne&s;s of ideas, and quickne&s;s of concep|tion, which are the fruit of temperance in eating and drinking.</P>
<P>It was about this period that, having one day been put to the blu&s;h for my ignorance in the art of calculation, which I had twice failed to learn while at &s;chool, I took up Cocker's Treati&s;e of Arithmetic, and went through it by my&s;elf with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, I al&s;o read a book of Navigation by Seller and Sturmy, and made my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the lit|tle geometry it contains, but I never proceed|ed far in this &s;cience. Nearly at the &s;ame time I read Locke on the Human Under&s;tand|ing, and the Art of Thinking by Me&s;&s;rs. du Port-Royal.</P>
<P>While labouring to form and improve my &s;tyle, I met with an Engli&s;h Grammar, which I believe was Greenwood's, having at the end of it two little e&s;&s;ays on rhetoric and logic. In the latter I found a model of di&s;pu|tation after the manner of Socrates. Shortly after I procured Xenophon's work, entitled, Memorable Things of Socrates, in which are various examples of the &s;ame method.
<PB N="29" REF="027004_0029_0FD2D860559C8FF0">Charmed to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m with this mode of di&s;puting, I adopted it, and re|nouncing blunt contradiction, and direct and po&s;itive argument, I a&s;&s;umed the character of a humble que&s;tioner. The peru&s;al of Shaft&s;|bury and Collins had made me a &s;ceptic; and being previou&s;ly &s;o as to many doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, I found Socrates's method to be both the &s;afe&s;t for my&s;elf, as well as the mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e again&s;t whom I employed it. It &s;oon afforded me &s;ingular plea&s;ure; I ince&s;&s;antly practi&s;ed it; and be|came very adroit in obtaining, even from per&s;ons of &s;uperior under&s;tanding, conce&s;&s;i|one of which they did not fore&s;ee the con&s;e|quences. Thus I involved them in difficulties from which they were unable to extricate them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes obtained victories, which neither my cau&s;e nor my arguments merited.</P>
<P>This method I continued to employ for &s;ome years; but I afterwards abandoned it by degrees, retaining only the habit of ex|pre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf with mode&s;t diffidence, and never making u&s;e, when I advanced any pro|po&s;ition which might be controverted, of the words <HI>certainly, undoubtedly,</HI> or any others that might give the appearance of being ob|&s;tinately attached to my opinion. I rather &s;aid, I imagine, I &s;uppo&s;e, or it appears to me, that &s;uch a thing is &s;o or &s;o, for &s;uch and &s;uch rea&s;ons; or it is &s;o, if I am not mi&s;taken. This habit has, I think, been of
<PB N="30" REF="027004_0030_0FD2D82D6E361BD0">con&s;iderable advantage to me, when I have had occa&s;ion to impre&s;s my opinion on the minds of others, and per&s;uade them to the adoption of the mea&s;ures I have &s;ugge&s;ted. And &s;ince the chief ends of conver&s;ation are, to inform or be informed, to plea&s;e or to per|&s;uade, I could wi&s;h that intelligent and well-meaning men would not them&s;elves dimini&s;h the powers they po&s;&s;e&s;s of being u&s;eful, by a po&s;itive and pre&s;umptuous manner of expre&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves, which &s;carcely ever fails to di&s;gu&s;t the hearer, and is only calculated to excite oppo&s;ition, and defeat every purpo&s;e for which the faculty of &s;peech has been be|&s;towed upon man. In &s;hort, if you wi&s;h to inform, a po&s;itive and dogmatical manner of advancing your opinion may provoke con|tradiction, and prevent your being heard with attention. On the other hand, if, with a de&s;ire of being informed, and of benefiting by the knowledge of others, you expre&s;s your&s;elves as being &s;trongly attached to your own opinions, mode&s;t and &s;en&s;ible men, who do not love di&s;putation, will leave you in tranquil po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your errors. By fol|lowing &s;uch a method, you can rarely hope to plea&s;e your auditors, conciliate their good|will, or work conviction on tho&s;e whom you may be de&s;irous of gaining over to your views.

If you a&s;k why I &s;ay with <HI>le&s;s propriety,</HI> I mu&s;t give you the two lines together:
<Q><L>Immode&s;t words admit of <HI>no defence,</HI></L>
<L>For want of decency is want of &s;en&s;e.</L></Q>
Now want of &s;en&s;e, when a man has the mi&s;|fortune to be &s;o circum&s;tanced, is it not a kind of excu&s;e for want of mode&s;ty? And would not the ver&s;es have been more accu|rate, if they had been con&s;tructed thus:
<Q><L>Immode&s;t words admit <HI>but this defence.</HI></L>
<L>That want of decency is want of &s;en&s;e.</L></Q>
But I leave the deci&s;ion of this to better judges than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In 1720, or 1721, my brother began to print a new public paper. It was the &s;econd that made its appearance in America, and was entitled the <HI>New-England Courant.</HI> The only one that exi&s;ted before was the <HI>Bo&s;ton News-Letter&punc;</HI> Some of his friends, I remem|ber, would have di&s;&s;uaded him from this un|dertaking, as a thing that was not likely to &s;ucceed; a &s;ingle new&s;paper being, in their opinion, &s;ufficient for all America. At pre|&s;ent, however, in 1777, there are no le&s;s than twenty-five. But he carried his project into execution, and I was employed in di&s;tri|buting
<PB N="32" REF="027004_0032_0FD2D830294FE5B0">the copies to his cu&s;tomers, after having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in compo&s;ing and working them off.</P>
<P>Among his friends he had a number of li|terary characters, who, as an amu&s;ement, wrote &s;hort e&s;&s;ays for the paper, which gave it reputation and increa&s;ed its &s;ale. The&s;e gentlemen came frequently to our hou&s;e. I heard the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed, and the accounts they gave of the favourable recep|tion of their writings with the public. I was tempted to try my hand among them; but, being &s;till a child as it were, I was fearful that my brother might be unwilling to print in his paper any performance of which he &s;hould know me to be the author. I there|fore contrived to di&s;gui&s;e my hand, and having written an anonymous piece, I placed it at night under the door of the printing-hou&s;e, where it was found the next morning. My brother communicated it to his friends, when they came as u&s;ual to &s;ee him, who read it, com|mented upon it within my hearing, and I had the exquite plea&s;ure to find that it met with their approbation, and that, in the various conjectures they made re&s;pecting the author, no one was mentioned who did not enjoy a high reputation in the country for talents and genius. I now &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf fortunate in my judges, and began to &s;u&s;pect that they were not much excellent writers as I had hi|therto &s;uppo&s;ed them. Be that as it may, encouraged by this little adventure, I wrote
<PB N="33" REF="027004_0033_0FD2D8A182022CE8">and &s;ent to the pre&s;s, in the &s;ame way, many other pieces, which were equally approved; keeping the &s;ecret till my &s;lender &s;tock of in|formation and knowledge for &s;uch performan|ces was pretty completely exhau&s;ted, when I made my&s;elf known.</P>
<P>My brother, upon this di&s;covery, began to entertain a little more re&s;pect for me; but he &s;till regarded him&s;elf as my ma&s;ter, and treat|ed me like an apprentice. He thought him|&s;elf entitled to the &s;ame &s;ervices from me as from any other per&s;on. On the contrary, I conceived that, in many in&s;tances, he was too rigorous, and that, on the part of a brother, I had a right to expect greater indulgence. Our di&s;putes were frequently brought before my father; and either my brother was general|ly in the wrong, or I was the better pleader of the two, for judgment was commonly given in my favour. But my brother was pa&s;&s;ionate, and often had recour&s;e to blows; a circum|&s;tance which I took in very ill part. This &s;e|vere and tyrannical treatment contributed, I believe, to imprint on my mind that aver&s;ion to arbitrary power, which during my whole life I have ever pre&s;erved. My apprentice&s;hip be|came in&s;upportable to me, and I continually &s;ighed for an opportunity of &s;hortening it, which at length unexpectedly offered.</P>
<P>An article in&s;erted in our paper upon &s;ome political &s;ubjects which I have now forgotten, gave offence to the A&s;&s;embly. My brother was taken into cu&s;tody, cen&s;ured, and ordered
<PB N="34" REF="027004_0034_0FD2D832EF712C10">into confinement for a month, becau&s;e, as I pre&s;ume, he would not di&s;cover the author. I was al&s;o taken up, and examined before the council; but, though I gave them no &s;atis|faction, they contented them&s;elves with repri|manding, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me; con&s;ider|ing me probably as bound, in quality of ap|prentice, to keep my ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>The impri&s;onment of my brother kindled my re&s;entment, notwith&s;tanding our private quarrels. During its continuance the man|agement of the paper was entru&s;ted to me, and I was bold enough to in&s;ert &s;ome pa&s;que|rades again&s;t the governors; which highly plea&s;ed my brother, while others began to look upon me in an unfavourable point of view, con&s;idering me as a young wit inclined to &s;a|tire and lampoon.</P>
<P>My brother's enlargement was accompan|ied with an arbitary order from the hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, <Q>That James Franklin &s;hould no longer print the new&s;paper entitled the <HI>New England Courant.</HI></Q> In this conjuncture, we held a con&s;ultation of our friends at the print|ing-hou&s;e, in order to determine what was pro|per to be done. Some propo&s;ed to evade the order, by changing the title of the paper; but my brother fore&s;eeing inconveniences that would re&s;ult from this &s;tep, thought it bet|ter that it &s;hould in future be printed in the name of Benjamin Franklin; and to avoid the cen&s;ure of the A&s;&s;embly, who might charge him with &s;till printing the paper him&s;elf, un|der
<PB N="35" REF="027004_0035_0FD2D86386CCB518">the name of his apprentice, it was re&s;olv|ed that my old indentures &s;hould be given up to me, with a full and entire di&s;charge writ|ten on the back, in order to be produced up|on an emergency: but that, to &s;ecure to my brother the benefit of my &s;ervice, I &s;hould &s;ign a new contract, which &s;hould be kept &s;ecret during the remainder of the term. This was a very &s;hallow arrangement. It was, however, carried into immediate execution, and the paper continued, in con&s;equence, to make its appearance for &s;ome months in my name. At length a new difference ari&s;ing be|tween my brother and me, I ventured to take advantage of my liberty, pre&s;uming that he would not dare to produce the new contract, It was undoubtedly di&s;honourable to avail my|&s;elf of this circum&s;tance, and I reckon this action as one of the fir&s;t errors of my life; but I was little capable of e&s;timating it as its true value, embittered as my mind had been by the recollection of the blows I had received. Exclu&s;ively of his pa&s;&s;ionate treatment of me, my brother was by no means a man of an ill temper, and perhaps my manners had too much of impertinence not to afford it a very natural pretext.</P>
<P>When he knew that it was my determina|tion to quit him, he wi&s;hed to prevent my finding employment el&s;ewhere. He went to all the printing-hou&s;es in the town, and prejudiced the ma&s;ters again&s;t me; who accordingly re|fu&s;ed to employ me. The idea then &s;ugge&s;t|ed
<PB N="36" REF="027004_0036_0FD2D833F828B198">it&s;elf to me of going to New-York, the neare&s;t town in which there was a printing-office. Farther reflections confirmed me in the de&s;ign of leaving Bo&s;ton, where I had already rendered my&s;elf an object of &s;u&s;picion to the governing party. It was probable, from the arbitrary proceedings of the A&s;&s;embly in the affair of my brother, that by remaining, I &s;hould &s;oon have been expo&s;ed to difficulties, which I had the greater rea&s;on to apprehend, as, from my indi&s;creet di&s;putes upon the &s;ub|ject of religion, I begun to be regarded, by pi|ous &s;ouls, with horror, either as an apo&s;tate or an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hei&s;t. I came therefore to a re&s;olution; but my father, in this in&s;tance, &s;iding with my brother, I pre&s;umed that if I attempted to depart openly, mea&s;ures would be taken to prevent me. My friend Collins undertook to favour my flight. He agreed for my pa&s;|&s;age with the captain of a New-York &s;loop, to whom he repre&s;ented me as a young man of his acquaintance, who had an affair with a girl of bad character, who&s;e parents wi&s;hed to compel me to marry her, and that of con&s;e|quence I could neither make my appearance nor go off publicly. I &s;old part of my books to procure a &s;mall &s;um of money, and went privately on board the &s;loop. By favour of a good wind, I found my&s;elf in three days at New-York, nearly three hundred miles from my home, at the age only of &s;eventeen years, without knowing an individual in the place, and with very little money in my pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027004_0037_0FD2D8657A1BD2F0">
The inclination I had felt for a &s;eafaring life was entirely &s;ub&s;ided, or I &s;hould now have been able to gratify it; but having another trade, and believing my&s;elf to be a tolerable workman, I he&s;itated not to offer my &s;ervices to the old Mr. William Bradford, who had been the fir&s;t printer in Penn&s;ylvania, but had quitted that province on account of a quarrel with George Keith, the governor. He could not give me employment him&s;elf, having little to do, and already as many per|&s;ons as he wanted; but he told me that his &s;on, a printer at Philadelphia, had lately lo&s;t his principal workman, Aquilla Ro&s;e, who was dead, and that if I would go thither, he believed that he would engage me. Phila|delphia was a hundred miles farther. I he&s;i|tated not to embark in a boat in order to re|pair, by the &s;horte&s;t cut of the &s;ea, to Am|boy, leaving my trunk and effects to come af|ter me by the u&s;ual and more tedious convey|ance. In cro&s;&s;ing the bay we met with a &s;quall, which &s;hattered to pieces our rotten &s;ails, prevented us from entering the Kill, and threw us upon Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>During the &s;quall a drunken Dutchman, who like my&s;elf was a pa&s;&s;enger in the boat, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll into the &s;ea. At the moment that he was &s;inking, I &s;eized him by the fore-top, &s;aved him, and drew him on board. This immer|&s;ion &s;obered him a little, &s;o that he fell a&s;leep, after having taken from his pocket a volume, which he reque&s;ted me to dry. This volume
<PB N="38" REF="027004_0038_0FD2D8358FDB2C70">I found to be my old favourite work, Bunyan's Voyages, in Dutch, a beautiful impre&s;&s;ion on fine paper, with copperplate engravings; a dre&s;s in which I had never &s;een it in its original language. I have &s;ince learned that it had been tran&s;lated into almo&s;t all the lan|guages of Europe, and next to the Bible, I am per&s;uaded, it is one of the books which has had the greate&s;t &s;pread. Hone&s;t John is the fir&s;t, that I know of, who has mixed narra|tive and dialogue together; a mode of wri|ting very engaging to the reader, who in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages, finds him&s;elf ad|mitted as it were into the company, and pre|&s;ent at the conver&s;ation. De Foe has imita|ted it with &s;ucce&s;s in his Robin&s;on Cru&s;o, his Moll Flanders, and other works; as al&s;o has Richard&s;on in his Pamela, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In approaching the i&s;land we found that we had made a part of the coa&s;t where it was not po&s;&s;ible to land, on account of the &s;trong breakers produced by the rocky &s;hore. We ca&s;t anchor and veered the cable toward the &s;hore. Some men, who &s;tood upon the brink, hallooed to us, while we did the &s;ame on our part; but the wind was &s;o high, and the waves &s;o noi&s;y, that we could neither of us hear each other. There were &s;ome ca|noes upon the bank, and we called out to them, and made &s;igns to prevail on them to come and take us up; but either they did not under&s;tand us, or they deemed our reque&s;t impracticable, and withdrew. Night came on, and nothing remained for us but to wait
<PB N="39" REF="027004_0039_0FD2D8688D9CC978">the &s;ub&s;iding of the wind; till when we de|termined, that this, the pilot and I, to &s;leep if po&s;&s;ible. For that purpo&s;e we went below the hatches along with the Dutchman, who was drenched with water. The &s;ea broke over the boat, and reached us in our retreat, &s;o that we were pre&s;ently as completely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reach|ed as he.</P>
<P>We had very little repo&s;e during the whole night: but the wind abating the next day, we &s;ucceeded in reaching Amboy before it was dark, after having pa&s;&s;ed thirty hours with|out provi&s;ions, and with no other drink than a bottle of bad rum, the water upon which we roved being &s;alt. In the evening I went to bed with a very violent fever. I had &s;ome|where read that cold water, drank plentifully, was a remedy in &s;uch ca&s;es. I followed the pre&s;cription, was in a profu&s;e &s;weat for the greater part of the night, and the fever left me. The next day I cro&s;&s;ed the river in a ferry-boat, and continued my journey on foot. I had fifty miles to walk, in order to reach Burlington, where I was told I &s;hould find pa&s;&s;age-boats that would convey me to Phila|delphia. It rained hard the whole day, &s;o that I was wet to the &s;kin. Finding my&s;elf fatigued about noon, I &s;topped at a paltry inn, where I pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day and the whole night, beginning to regret that I had quitted my home. I made be&s;ides &s;o wretched a figure, that I was &s;u&s;pected to be &s;ome run-away &s;ervant. This I di&s;covered by
<PB N="40" REF="027004_0040_0FD2D83CB4E42170">the que&s;tions that were a&s;ked me; and I felt that I was every moment in danger of being taken up as &s;uch. The next day, however I continued my journey, and arrived in the evening at an inn, eight or ten miles from Burlington, that was kept by one Dr. Brown.</P>
<P>This man entered into conver&s;ation with me while I took &s;ome refre&s;hment, and per|ceiving that I had read a little, he expre&s;&s;ed to|wards me con&s;iderable intere&s;t and friend&s;hip. Our acquaintance continued during the re|mainder of his life. I believe him to have been what is called an itinerant doctor; for there was no town in England, or indeed in Europe, of which he could not give a partic|ular account. He was neither deficient in un|der&s;tanding nor literature, but he was a &s;ad infidel; and, &s;ome years after, undertook to trave&s;ty the Bible in burle&s;que ver&s;e, as Cot|ton has trave&s;tied Virgil. He exhibited, by this means, many facts in a very ludicrous point of view, which would have given um|brage to weak minds, had his work been pub|li&s;hed, which it never was.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the night at his hou&s;e, and reached Burlington the next morning. On my arriv|al, I had the mortification to learn that the ordinary pa&s;&s;age-boats had &s;ailed a little before. This was on a Saturday, and there would be no other boat till the Tue&s;day following. I returned to the hou&s;e of an old woman in the town who had &s;old me &s;ome gingerbread to eat one of my pa&s;&s;age, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her advice.
<PB N="41" REF="027004_0041_0FD2D869F4A17708">She invited me to take up my abode with her till an opportunity offered for me to embark. Fatigued with having travelled &s;o far on foot, I accepted her invitation. When &s;he under|&s;tood that I was a printer, &s;he would have per|&s;uaded me to &s;tay at Burlington, and &s;et up my trade: but &s;he was little aware of the cap|ital that would be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a purpo&s;e! I was treated while at her hou&s;e with true ho&s;|pitality. She gave me, with the utmo&s;t good|will, a dinner of beef-&s;teaks, and would ac|cept of nothing in return but a pint of ale.</P>
<P>Here I imagined my&s;elf to be fixed till the Tue&s;day in the en&s;uing week; but walking out in the evening by the river &s;ide, I &s;aw a boat with a number of per&s;ons in it approach. It was going to Philadelphia, and the compa|ny took me in. As there was no wind, we could only make way with our oars. About midnight, not perceiving the town, &s;ome of the company were of opinion that we mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed it, and were unwilling to row any farther; the re&s;t not knowing where we were it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;top. We drew towards the &s;hore, entered a creek, and land|ed near &s;ome old pali&s;ades, which &s;erved us for fire-wood, it being a cold night in Octo|ber. Here we &s;tayed till day, when one of the company found the place in which we were to be Cooper's Creek, a little above Philadel|phia; which in reality we perceived the mo|ment we were out of the creek. We arrived on Sunday abought eight or nine o'clock in
<PB N="42" REF="027004_0042_0FD2D83E7B358050">the morning, and landed on Market-&s;treet wharf.</P>
<P>I have entered into the particulars of my voyage, and &s;hall in like manner de&s;cribe my fir&s;t entrance into this city, that you may be able to compare beginnings &s;o little au&s;pic|ious, with the figure I have &s;ince made.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Philadelphia I was in my working dre&s;s, my be&s;t clothes being to come by &s;ea. I was covered with dirt; my pock|ets were filled with &s;hirts and &s;tockings; I was unacquainted with a &s;ingle &s;oul in the place, and knew not where to &s;eek for a lodging. Fatigued with walking, rowing, and having pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, I was extreme|ly hungry, and all my money con&s;i&s;ted of a Dutch dollar, and about a &s;hilling's worth of coppers, which I gave to the boatmen for my pa&s;&s;age. As I had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in row|ing, they refu&s;ed it at fir&s;t; but I in&s;i&s;ted on their taking it. A man is &s;ometimes more generous when he has little, than when he has much money; probably becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, he is de&s;irous of concealing his pov|erty.</P>
<P>I walked towards the top of the &s;treet, look|ing eagerly on both &s;ides, till I came to Mar|ket-&s;treet, where I met a child with a loaf of bread. Often had I made my dinner on dry bread. I enquired where he had bought it, and went &s;traight to the baker's &s;hop which he pointed out to me. I a&s;ked for &s;ome bi&s;|cuits, expecting to find &s;uch as we had at Bo&s;|ton;
<PB N="43" REF="027004_0043_0FD2D86FECCD7F68">but they made, it &s;eems, none of that &s;ort at Philadelphia. I then a&s;ked for a three-penny loaf. They made no loaves of that price. Finding my&s;elf ignorant of the prices, as well as of the different kinds of bread, I de&s;ired him to let me have three penny-worth of bread of &s;ome kind or other. He gave me three large rolls. I was &s;urprized at receiving &s;o much: I took them, however, and having no room in my pockets, I walked on with a roll under each arm, eating the third. In this manner I went through Market-&s;treet to Fourth &s;treet, and pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of Mr. Read, the father of my future wife. She was &s;tanding at the door, ob&s;erved me, and thought, with rea&s;on, that I made a very &s;ingular and gro|te&s;que appearance.</P>
<P>I then turned the corner, and went through Che&s;nut-&s;treet, eating my roll all the way; and having made this round, I found my&s;elf again on Market-&s;treet wharf, near the boat in which I had arrived. I &s;tepped into it to take a draught of river-water; and finding my&s;elf &s;atisfied with my fir&s;t roll, I gave the other two to a woman and her child, who had come down the river with us in the boat, and was waiting to continue her journey. Thus refre&s;hed, I regained the &s;treet, which was now full of well-dre&s;&s;ed people, all going the &s;ame way. I joined them, and was thus led to a large Quakers' meeting-hou&s;e near the market-place. I &s;at down with the re&s;t, and after looking round me for &s;ome time, hear|ing
<PB N="44" REF="027004_0044_0FD2D841908439C8">nothing &s;aid, and being drow&s;y from my la&s;t night's labour and want of re&s;t, I fell in|to a &s;ound &s;leep. In this &s;tate I continued till the a&s;&s;embly di&s;per&s;ed, when one of the con|gregation had the goodne&s;s to wake me. This was con&s;equently the fir&s;t hou&s;e I entered, or in which I &s;lept at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I began again to walk along the &s;treets by the river &s;ide; and looking attentively in the face of every one I met, I at length perceived a young quaker, who&s;e countenance plea&s;ed me. I acco&s;ted him, and begged, him to inform me where a &s;tranger might find a lodging. We were then near the &s;ign of the Three Mariners. They receive travellers here, &s;aid he, but it is not a hou&s;e that bears a good cha|racter; if you will go with me, I will &s;hew you a better one. He conducted me to the Crooked Billet, in Water-&s;treet. There I or|dered &s;omething for dinner, and during my meal, a number of curious que&s;tions were put to me; my youth and appearance exciting the &s;u&s;picion of my being a run-away. After din|ner my drow&s;ine&s;s returned, and I threw my|&s;elf upon a bed without taking off my clothes, and &s;lept till &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when I was called to &s;upper. I afterwards went to bed at a very early hour, and did not awake till the next morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I got up I put my&s;elf in as de|cent a trim as I could, and went to the hou&s;e of Andrew Bradford the printer. I found his father in the &s;hop, whom I had &s;een at
<PB N="45" REF="027004_0045_0FD2D8717B697130">New-York. Having travelled on hor&s;eback, he had arrived at Philadelphia before me. He introduced me to his &s;on, who received me with civility, and gave me &s;ome breakfa&s;t; but told me he had no occa&s;ion for a journeyman, having lately procured one. He added, that there was another printer newly &s;ettled in the town, of the name of Keimer, who might perhaps employ me; and in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, I &s;hould be welcome to lodge at his hou&s;e, and he would give me a little work now and then, till &s;omething better &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>The old man offered to introduce me to the new printer. When we were at his hou&s;e: "Neighbour," &s;aid he, <Q>I bring you a young man in the printing bu&s;ine&s;s; perhaps you may have need of his &s;ervices.</Q></P>
<P>Keimer a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions, put a com|po&s;ing &s;tick in my hand to &s;ee how I could work, and then &s;aid, that at pre&s;ent he had nothing for me to do, but that he &s;hould &s;oon be able to employ me. At the &s;ame time ta|king old Bradford for an inhabitant of the town well-di&s;po&s;ed towards him, he commu|nicated his project to him, and the po&s;pect he had of &s;ucce&s;s. Bradford was careful not to di&s;cover that he was the father of the other printer; and from what Keimer had &s;aid, that he hoped &s;hortly to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the great|er part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the town, led him by artful que&s;tions, and by &s;tarting &s;ome difficulties, to di&s;clo&s;e all his views, what his hopes were founded upon, and how he intended to pro|ceed.

<P>I found Keimer's printing materials to con|&s;i&s;t of an old damaged pre&s;s, and a &s;mall ca&s;t of worn-out Engli&s;h letters, with which he was him&s;elf at work upon an elegy on Aquila Ro&s;e, whom I have mentioned above, an in|genious young man, and of an excellent cha|racter, highly e&s;teemed in the town, &s;ecretary to the A&s;&s;embly, and a very tolerable poet Keimer al&s;o made ver&s;es, but they were indif|ferent ones. He could not be &s;aid to write in ver&s;e, for his method was to take and &s;et the lines as they flowed from his mu&s;e; and as he worked without copy, had but one &s;et of let|ter-ca&s;es, and the elegy would probably occu|py all his type, it was impo&s;&s;ible for any one to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.

<P>In a few days Keimer &s;ent for me to print off his elegy. He had now procured another &s;et of letter-ca&s;es, and had a pamphlet to re|print, upon which he &s;et me to work.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="027004_0047_0FD2D87301E69668">The two Philadelphia printers appeared de&s;titute of every qualification nece&s;&s;ary in their profe&s;&s;ion. Bradford had not been brought up to it, and was very illiterate. Keimer, though he under&s;tood at little of the bu&s;ine&s;s, was merely a compo&s;itor, and whol|ly incapable of working at the pre&s;s. He had one of the French prophets, and knew how to imitate their &s;upernatural agitations. At the time of our fir&s;t acquaintance he profe&s;&s;ed no particular religion, but a little of all upon occa&s;ion. He was totally ignorant of the world, and a great knave at heart, as I had afterwards an opportunity of experiencing.</P>
<P>Keimer could not endure that, working with him, I &s;hould lodge at Bradford's. He had indeed a hou&s;e, but it was unfurni&s;hed; &s;o that he could not take me in. He procu|red me a lodging at Mr. Read's, his landlord, whom I have already mentioned. My trunk and effects being now arrived, I thought of making, in the eyes of Mi&s;s Read, a more re&s;pectable appearance than when chance ex|hibited me to her view, eating my roll, and wandering in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>From this period I began to contract ac|quaintance with &s;uch young people of the town as were fond of reading, and &s;pent my even|ings with them agreeably, while at the &s;ame time I gained money by my indu&s;try, and thanks to my frugality, lived contented. I thus forgot Bo&s;ton as much as po&s;&s;ible, and wi&s;hed every one to be ignorant of the place

<P>An incident, however arrived, which &s;ent me home much &s;ooner than I had propo&s;ed. I had a brother-in-law, of the name of Robert Holmes, ma&s;ter of a trading &s;loop from Bo&s;|ton to Delaware. Being at Newca&s;tle, forty miles below Philadelphia, he heard of me, and wrote to inform me of the chagrin which my &s;udden departure from Bo&s;ton had occa|&s;ioned my parents, and of the affection which they &s;till entertained for me, a&s;&s;uring me that, if I would return, every thing &s;hould be ad|ju&s;ted to my &s;atisfaction; and he was very pre&s;&s;ing in his entreaties. I an&s;wered his let|ter, thanked him for his advice, and explain|ed the rea&s;ons which had induced me to quit Bo&s;ton, with &s;uch force and clearne&s;s, that he was convinced I had been le&s;s to blame than he had imagined.</P>
<P>Sir William Keith, governor of the prov|ince was at Newca&s;tle at the time. Captain Holmes, being by chance in his company when he received my letter, took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of me, and &s;hewed it him. The governor read it, and appeared &s;urpri&s;ed when he learn|ed my age. He thought me, he &s;aid, a young man of very promi&s;ing talents, and that, of con&s;equence, I ought to be encouraged; that there were at Philadelphia none but very ig|norant printers, and that if I were to &s;et up for my&s;elf, he had no doubt of my &s;ucce&s;s; that, for his own part, he would procure me
<PB N="49" REF="027004_0049_0FD2D874E8199C18">all the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and would render me every other &s;ervice in his power. My broth|er-in-law related all this to me afterwards at Bo&s;ton; but I knew nothing of it at the time; when one day Keimer and I being at work together near the window, we &s;aw the gover|nor and another gentleman, colonel French of Newca&s;tle, hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed, cro&s;s the &s;treet, and make directly for our hou&s;e. We heard them at the door, and Keimer, believing it to be a vi&s;it to him&s;elf, went immediately down: but the governor enquired for me, came up &s;tairs, and, with a conde&s;cen&s;ion and politene&s;s to which I had not at all been accu&s;tomed, paid me many compliments, de|&s;ired to be acquainted with me, obligingly re|proached me for not having made my&s;elf known to him on my arrival in the town and wi&s;hed me to accompany him to a tavern, where he and colonel French were going to ta&s;t &s;ome excellent Madeira wine.</P>
<P>I was, I confe&s;s, &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, and Keimer appeared thunder&s;truck. I went how|ever with the governor and the colonel to a tavern at the corner of Third-&s;treet, where, while we were drinking the Madeira, he pro|po&s;ed to me to e&s;tabli&s;h a printing-hou&s;e. He &s;et forth the probabilities of &s;ucce&s;s, and him|&s;elf and colonel French a&s;&s;ured me that I &s;hould have their protection and influence in obtain|ing the printing of the public papers of both governments; and as I appeared to doubt whether my father would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this en|terpri&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="027004_0050_0FD2D876B46C7C88">Sir William &s;aid that he would give me a letter to him, in which he would repre|&s;ent the advantages of the &s;cheme, in a light which he had no doubt would determine him. It was thus concluded that I &s;hould return to Bo&s;ton by the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el, with the letter of recommendation from the governor to my father. Meanwhile the project was to be kept &s;ecret, and I continued to work for Kei|mer as before.</P>
<P>The governor &s;ent every now and then to invite me to dine with him. I co&s;iderd this as a very great honour; and I was the more &s;en&s;ible of it, as he conver&s;ed with me in the mo&s;t affable, familar, and friendly manner imaginable.</P>
<P>Towards the end of April 1724, a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el was ready to &s;ail for Bo&s;ton-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> leave of Keimer, upon the pretext of going to &s;ee my parents. The governor gave me a long letter, in which he &s;aid many flattering things of me to my father; and &s;trongly re|commended the project of my &s;ettling at Philadelphia, as a thing which could not fail to make my fortune.</P>
<P>Going down the bay we &s;truck on a flat, and &s;prung a leak. The weather was very tempe&s;tuous, and we were obliged to pump without intermi&s;&s;ion; I took my turn. We arrived however &s;afe and &s;ound at Bo&s;ton, af|ter about a fortnight's pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>I had been ab&s;ent &s;even complete months and my relations, during that interval, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="51" REF="027004_0051_0FD2D88EC7BDCFC0">received no intelligence of me; for my bro|ther-in-law, Holmes, was not yet returned, and had not written about me. My unex|pected appearance &s;urpri&s;ed the family; but they were all delighted at &s;eeing me again, and, except my brother, welcomed me home. I went to him at the printing-office. I was better dre&s;&s;ed than I had ever been while in his &s;ervice; I had a complete &s;uit of clothes, new and neat, a watch in my pocket, and my pur&s;e was furni&s;hed with nearly five pounds &s;terling in money. He gave me no very civil reception; and having eyed me from head to foot, re&s;umed his work.</P>
<P>The workmen a&s;ked me with eagerne&s;s where I had been, what &s;ort of a country it was, and how I liked it. I &s;poke in the high|e&s;t terms of Philadelphia, the happy life we led there, and expre&s;&s;ed my intention of going back again. One of them a&s;ked what &s;ort of money we had, I di&s;played before them a handful of &s;ilver, which I drew from my pocket. This was a curio&s;ity to which they were not accu&s;tomed, paper being the cur|rent money at Bo&s;ton. I failed not after this to let them &s;ee my watch; and at la&s;t, my brother continuing &s;ullen and out of hu|mour, I gave them a &s;hilling to drink, and took my leave. This vi&s;it &s;tung my brother to the &s;oul; for when, &s;hortly after, my mo|ther &s;poke to him of a reconciliation, and a de&s;ire of &s;eeing us upon good terms, he told her that I had &s;o in&s;ulted him before his men,
<PB N="52" REF="027004_0052_0FD2D87CCB409D80">that he would never forget or forgive it: in this, however, he was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The governor's letter appeared to excite in my father &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; but he &s;aid little. After &s;ome days, Capt. Holmes being returned, he &s;hewed it him, a&s;king him if he knew Keith, and what &s;ort of a man he was: adding, that, in his opinion, it proved very little di&s;cern|ment to think of &s;etting up a boy in bu&s;ine&s;s, who for three years to come would not be of an age to be ranked in the cla&s;s of men. Holmes &s;aid every thing he could in favour of the &s;cheme; but my father firmly maintained its ab&s;urdity, and at la&s;t gave a po&s;itive re|fu&s;al. He wrote, however, a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the protection he had &s;o obligingly offered me, but refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e he thought me too young to be entru&s;ted with the conduct of &s;o important an enterpri&s;e, and which would require &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um of money.</P>
<P>My old comrade Collins, who was a clerk in the po&s;t-office, charmed with the account I gave of my new re&s;idence, expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire of going thither; and while I waited my father's determination, he &s;et off before me, by land, for Rhode-I&s;land, leaving his books, which formed a hand&s;ome collection in ma|thematics and natural philo&s;ophy, to be con|veyed with mine to New-York, where he pur|po&s;ed to wait for me.</P>
<P>My father, though he could not approve Sir William's propo&s;al, was yet plea&s;ed that I
<PB N="53" REF="027004_0053_0FD2D89051F61D30">had obtained &s;o advantageous a recommenda|tion as that a per&s;on of his rank, and that my indu&s;try and economy had enabled me to equip my&s;elf &s;o hand&s;omely in &s;o &s;hort a peri|od&punc; Seeing no appearance of accommodat|ing matters between my brother and me, he con&s;ented to my return to Philadelphia, advi|&s;ed me to be civil to every body, to endeavour to obtain general e&s;teem, and avoid &s;atire and &s;arca&s;m, to which he thought I was too much inclined; adding, that, with per&s;everance and prudent economy, I might, by the time I be|came of age, &s;ave enough to e&s;tabli&s;h my&s;elf in bu&s;ine&s;s; and that if a &s;mall &s;um &s;hould then be wanting, he would undertake to &s;up|ply it.</P>
<P>This was all I could obtain from him, ex|cept &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents, in token of friend|&s;hip from him and my mother. I embarked once more for New-York, furni&s;hed at this time with their approbation and ble&s;&s;ing. The &s;loop having touched at Newport in Rhode-I&s;land, I paid a vi&s;it to my brother John, who had for &s;ome years been &s;ettled there, and was married. He had always been attach|ed to me, and received me with great affec|tion. One of his friends, who&s;e name was Vernon, having a debt of about thirty-&s;ix pounds due to him in Penn&s;ylvania, begged me to receive it for him, and keep the money till I &s;hould hear from him: accordingly he gave me an order for that purpo&s;e. This af|fair
<PB N="54" REF="027004_0054_0FD2D87EF808BDE8">occa&s;ioned me, in the &s;equel, much un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>At Newport we took on board a number of pa&s;&s;engers; among whom were two young women, and a grave and &s;en&s;ible quaker lady with her &s;ervants. I had &s;hown an obliging forwardne&s;s in rendering the quaker &s;ome tri|fling &s;ervices, which led her, probably, to feel &s;ome intere&s;t in my welfare; for when &s;he &s;aw a familiarity take place, and every day increa&s;e, between the two young women and me, &s;he took me a&s;ide and &s;aid, "Young man, I am in pain for thee. Thou ha&s;t no parent to watch over thy conduct, and thou &s;eeme&s;t to be ignorant of the world, and the &s;nares to which youth is expo&s;ed. Rely upon what I tell thee: tho&s;e are women of bad characters; I perceive it in all their actions. If thou do&s;t not take care, they will lead thee into danger. They are &s;trangers to thee, and I advi&s;e thee, by the friendly intere&s;t I take in thy pre&s;ervation, to form no connection with them." As I appeared at fir&s;t not to think quite &s;o ill of them as &s;he did, &s;he re|lated many things &s;he had &s;een and heard, which had e&s;caped my attention, but which convinced me &s;he was in the right. I thanked her for her obliging advice, and promi&s;ed to follow it.</P>
<P>When we arrived at New-York, they in|formed me where they lodged, and invited me to come and &s;ee them. I did not however go, and it was well I did not; for the next
<PB N="55" REF="027004_0055_0FD2D8949DEF8B30">day, the captain, mi&s;&s;ing a &s;ilver &s;poon and &s;ome other things which had been taken from the cabin, and knowing the&s;e women to be pro&s;titutes, procured a &s;earch warrant, found the &s;tolen goods upon them, and had them puni&s;hed. And thus, after having been &s;aved from one rock concealed under water, upon which the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck during our pa&s;&s;age, I e&s;caped another of a &s;till more dangerous nature.</P>
<P>At New-York I found my friend Collins, who had arrived &s;ome time before. We had been intimate from our infancy, and had read the &s;ame books together; but he had the ad|vantage of being able to devote more time to reading and &s;tudy, and an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;po&s;i|tion for mathematics, in which he left me far behind. When at Bo&s;ton, I had been accu&s;|tomed to pa&s;s with him almo&s;t all my lei&s;ure hours. He was then a &s;ober and indu&s;trious lad; his knowledge had gained him a very general e&s;teem, and he &s;eemed to promi&s;e to make an advantageous figure in &s;ociety. But, during my ab&s;ence, he had unfortunately ad|dicted him&s;elf to brandy, and I learned, as well from him&s;elf as from the report of others, that every day &s;ince his arrival at New-York he had been intoxicated, and had acted in a very extravagant manner. He had al&s;o played, and lo&s;t all his money; &s;o that I was obliged to pay all his expences at the inn, and to main|tain him during the re&s;t of the journey; a burden that was very inconvenient to me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="027004_0056_0FD2D88106F1C948">
The governor of New-York, who&s;e name was Burrent, hearing the captain &s;ay that a young man who was a pa&s;&s;enger in his &s;hip had a great number of books, begged him to bring me to his hou&s;e. I accordingly went, and &s;hould have taken Collins with me, had he been &s;ober. The governor treated me with great civility, &s;hewed me his library, which was a very con&s;iderable one, and we talked for &s;ome time upon books and authors. This was the &s;econd governor who had honoured me with his attention; and to a poor boy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I then was, the&s;e little adventures did not fail to be plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>We arrived at Philadelphia. On the way I received Vernon's money, without which we &s;hould have been unable to have fini&s;hed our journey.</P>
<P>Collins wi&s;hed to get employment as a mer|chant's clerk; but either his breath or his coun|tenance betrayed his bad habit; for, though he had recommendations, he met with no &s;ucce&s;s, and continued to lodge and eat with me, and at my expence. Knowing that I had Vernon's money, he was continually a&s;king me to lend him &s;ome of it; promi&s;ing to repay me at he &s;hould get employment. At la&s;t he had drawn &s;o much of this money, that I was ex|tremely alarmed at what might become of me, &s;hould he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to make good the deficiency. His habit of drinking did not all dimini&s;h, and was a frequent &s;ource of di&s;cord between us for when he had drank a little too much, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was very head&s;trong.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="027004_0057_0FD2D89729941E88">Being one day in a boat together, on the Delaware, with &s;ome other young per&s;ons, he refu&s;ed to take his turn in rowing. You &s;hall row for me, &s;aid he, till we get home.&mdash; No, I replied, we will not row for you.&mdash; You &s;hall, &s;aid he, or remain upon the water all night.&mdash;As you plea&s;e.&mdash;Let us row, &s;aid the re&s;t of the company: what &s;ignifies wheth|er he a&s;&s;i&s;ts or not. But, already angry with him for his conduct in other re&s;pects, I per|&s;i&s;ted in my refu&s;al. He then &s;wore that he would make me row, or would throw me out of the boat; and he made up to me. As &s;oon as he was within my reach I took him by the collar, gave him a violent thru&s;t, and threw him head-foremo&s;t into the river. I knew that he was a good &s;wimmer, and was therefore under no apprehen&s;ions for his life.</P>
<P>Before he could turn him&s;elf, we were able, by a few &s;trokes of our oars, to place our&s;elves out of his reach; and whenever he touch|ed the boat, we a&s;ked him if he would row, &s;triking his hands with the oars to make him let go his hold. He was nearly &s;uffocated with rage, but ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed making any promi&s;e to row. Perceiving at length that his &s;trenght began to be exhau&s;ted, we took him into the boat, and conveyed him home in the evening, completely drenched.

<P>The violation of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me by Vernon, was one of the fir&s;t great errors of my life; and it proves that my father was not mi&s;taken when he &s;uppo&s;ed me too young to be intru&s;ted with the management of im|portant affairs. But Sir William, upon read|ing his letter, thought him too prudent. There was a difference, he &s;aid, between individuals years of maturity were not always accom|panied with di&s;cretion, neither was youth in every in&s;tance devoid of it.

<P>I gave him an inventory of a &s;mall printing-office; the expence of which I had calculated at about a hundred pounds &s;terling.

<P>In the account of my fir&s;t voyage from Bo&s;ton to Philadelphia, I omitted I believe a trifling circum&s;tance, which will not perhaps be out of place here. During a calm which &s;topped us above Block-I&s;land, the crew employed them&s;elves in fi&s;hing for cod, of which they
<PB N="60" REF="027004_0060_0FD2D885B525D9A8">caught a great number. I had hitherto adhe|red to my re&s;olution of not eating any thing that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed life; and I con&s;idered on this occa&s;ion, agreeably to the maxims of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ma&s;ter Tryon, the capture of every fi&s;h as a &s;ort of murder, committed without provoca|tion, &s;ince the&s;e animals had neither done, nor were capable of doing, the &s;malle&s;t injury to any one that &s;hould ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure. This mode of rea&s;oning I conceived to be un|an&s;werable. Meanwhile I had formerly been extremely fond of fi&s;h; and when one of the&s;e cod was taken out of the frying-pan, I thought its flavour delicious.

<P>I continued to live upon good terms with Keimer, who had not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of my projected e&s;tabli&s;hment. He &s;till re|tained a portion of his former enthu&s;ia&s;m; and being fond of argument, we frequently di&s;|puted together. I was &s;o much in the habit

<P>When he me explained to his tenets, I &s;ound many ab&s;urdities which I refu&s;ed to admit, un|le&s;s he would agree in turn to adopt &s;ome of my opinions. Keimer wore his beard long, becau&s;e Mo&s;es had &s;omewhere &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not mar the corners of thy beard.</HI> He likewi&s;e ob&s;erved the Sabbath; and the&s;e were with him two very e&s;&s;ential points. I di&s;liked them both; but I con&s;ented to adopt them, provided he would ab&s;tain from animal food. I doubt, &s;aid he, whether my con&s;titution will be able to &s;upport it. I a&s;&s;ured him on the contrary, that he would find him&s;elf the better for it. He was naturally a glutton, and I wi&s;hed to amu&s;e my&s;elf by &s;tarving him.

A woman in the neighbourhood prepared and brought us our victuals, to whom I gave a li&s;t of forty di&s;hes, in the compo&s;ition of which there entered nei|ther fle&s;h nor fi&s;h.

<P>I have &s;ince that period ob&s;erved &s;everal Lents with the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s, and had &s;ud|denly returned again to my ordinary diet, without experiencing the &s;malle&s;t inconven|ience; which has led me to regard as of no im|portance the advice commonly given, of in|troducing gradually &s;uch alterations of regi|men.</P>
<P>I continued it cheerfully; but poor Keimer &s;uffered terribly. Tired of the project, he &s;ighed for the fle&s;h pots of Egypt. At length he ordered a roa&s;t pig, and invited me and two of our female acquaintance to dine with him; but the pig being ready a little too &s;oon, he could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation, and eat it all up before we arrived.</P>
<P>During the circum&s;tances I have related, I had paid &s;ome attentions to Mi&s;s Read. I entertained for her the utmo&s;t e&s;teem and affection; and I had rea&s;on to believe that the&s;e &s;entiments were mutual. But we were both young, &s;carcely more than eighteen years of age; and as I was on the point of under|taking a long voyage, her mother thought it prudent to prevent matters being carried to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>My mo&s;t intimate aquaintance at this time were Charles O&s;borne, Jo&s;eph Wat&s;on, and James Ralph; young men who were all fond of reading. The two fir&s;t were clerks to Mr. Charles Brockdon, one of the principal at|tornies in the town, and the other clerk to a merchant. Wat&s;on was an upright, pious and &s;en&s;ible young man: the others were &s;omewhat more loo&s;e in their principles of re|ligion, particularly Ralph, who&s;e faith, as well as that of Collins, I had contributed to &s;hake; each of whom made me &s;uffer a very adequate puni&s;hment. O&s;borne was &s;en&s;ible, and &s;incere and affectionate in his friend&s;hips, but too much inclined to the critic in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tters of literature. Ralph was ingenious and &s;hrewd, genteel in his addre&s;s, and extremely eloquent. I do not remember to have met will a more agreeable &s;peaker. They were both enamour|ed of the mu&s;es, and had already evinced their pa&s;&s;ion by &s;ome &s;mall poetical produc|tions.</P>
<P>It was a cu&s;tom with us to take a charming w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k on Sundays, in the woods that border|ed on the Schuylkill. Here we read together, and afterwards conver&s;ed on what we read.
<PB N="64" REF="027004_0064_0FD2D88D4E015B90">Ralph was di&s;po&s;ed to give him&s;elf up entir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to poetry.

<P>The time of our meeting drew near, when Ralph called upon me, and told me his pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was ready.

I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in terms of warm approbation; becau&s;e it really appeared to have con&s;iderable merit. He then &s;aid: O&s;borne will never acknowledge the &s;malle&s;t degree of excellence in any produc|tion of mine. Envy alone dictates to him a thou&s;and animadver&s;ions. Of you he is not &s;o jealous: I wi&s;h therefore, you would take the ver&s;es, and produce them as your own. I will pretend not to have had lei&s;ure to write any thing.

<P>We met. Wat&s;on's performance was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that was read. It had &s;ome beauties, but many faults. We next read O&s;borne's, which was much better. Ralph did it ju&s;tice, re|marking a few imperfections, and applauding &s;uch parts as were excellent. He had him&s;elf nothing to &s;how. It was now my turn. I made &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me difficulty; &s;eemed as if I wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed; pretended that I had had no time to make corrections, &amp;c. No excu&s;e, however, was admi&s;&s;ible, and the piece mu&s;t be produced. It was read and re-read. Wat&s;on and O&s;borne immediately re&s;igned the palm, and united in applauding it. Ralph alone made a few remarks, and propo&s;ed &s;ome alterations; but I defended my text. O&s;borne agreed with me, and told Ralph he was no more able to critici&s;e than he was able to write.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="027004_0066_0FD2D77B30B9B1A0">
When O&s;borne was alone with me, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;till more &s;trongly in favour of what he con&s;idered as my performance. He pretended that he had put &s;ome re&s;train<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on him&s;elf before, apprehen&s;ive of my con|&s;truing his commendation into flattery. But who would have &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;aid he, Franklin to be capable of &s;uch a compo&s;ition? What painting, what energy, what fire! He has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the original.

<P>At our next meeting Ralph di&s;covered the trick we had played O&s;borne, who was ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lied without mercy.</P>
<P>By this adventure Ralph was fixed in his re&s;olution of becoming a poet.

He was greatly regretted; for he was the be&s;t of our &s;ociety. O&s;borne went to the i&s;lands, where he gained con&s;iderable reputation as a

We had &s;eriou&s;ly engaged, that whoever died fir&s;t &s;hould return, if po&s;&s;ible, and pay a friendly vi&s;it to the &s;urvivor, to him an account of other world; but he has never fulfilled his engagement.</P>
<P>The governor appeared to be fond of my company, and frequently invited me to his hou&s;e. He always &s;poke of his intention of &s;ettling me in bu&s;ine&s;s, as a point that was de|cided. I was to take with me letters of recom|mendation to a number of friends; and par|ticularly a letter of credit, in order to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary &s;um for the purcha&s;e of my pre&s;s, types and paper. He appointed various times for me to come for the&s;e letters, which would certainly be ready; and when I came, always put me off to another day.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive delays continued till the ve&s;&s;el, who&s;e departure had been &s;everal times deferred, was on the point of &s;etting &s;ail; when I again went to Sir William's hou&s;e to receive my letters and take leave of him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aw his &s;ecretary, Dr. Bard, who told me that the governor was extremely bu&s;y writing, but that he would be down at Newca&s;tle before the ve&s;&s;el, and that the letters would be de|livered to me there.</P>
<P>Ralph, though he was married and had a child, determined to accompany me in this voyage. His object was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the e&s;tabli&s;hing a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome mer|cantile hou&s;es, in order to &s;ell goods by
<PB N="68" REF="027004_0068_0FD2D753BB80F8A0">commi&s;&s;ion; but I afterwards learned, that having rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the pa|rents of his wife, he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf to leave her on their hands, and never return to America again.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of my friends, and in|terchanged promi&s;es of fidelity with Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Read, I quitted Philadelphia. At Newca&s;tle the ve&s;&s;el came to anchor. The governor was ar|rived, and I went to his logdings. His &s;ecre|tary received me with great civilty, told me on the part of the govorner that he could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or me then, as he was engaged in affairs of the utmo&s;t importance, but that he would &s;end the letters on board, and that he wi&s;hed me, with all his heart, a good voyage and &s;peedy return I returned &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hed, but &s;till with out entertaining the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton, a celebrated barri&s;ter of Philadelphia, had taken a pa&s;&s;age to England for him&s;elf and his &s;on, and, in conjunction with Mr. Denham a quaker, and Me&s;&s;rs. O|niam and Ru&s;&s;el, proprietors of a forge in Maryland, had agreed for the whole cabin, &s;o that Ralph and I were obliged to take up our lodging with the crew. Being unknown to every body in the &s;hip, we were looked up|on as the common order of people: but Mr. Hamilton and his &s;on (it was James, who was afterwards governor) left us at Newca&s;tle, and returned to Philadelphia, where he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> recalled, at a very great expence, to plead the cau&s;e of a ve&s;&s;el that had been &s;eized; and
<PB N="69" REF="027004_0069_0FD2D75582A31450">ju&s;t as we were about to &s;ail, colonel Finch came on board, and &s;hewed me many civili|ties. The pa&s;&s;engers upon this paid me more attention, and I was invited, together with my friend Ralph, to occupy the place in the cabin, which the return of the Mr. Hamiltons had made vacant; an offer which we very readily accepted.</P>
<P>Having learned that the di&s;patches of the go|vernor had been brought on board by colonel Finch, I a&s;ked the captain for the letters that were to be intru&s;ted to my care. He told me that they were all put together in the bag, which he could not open at pre&s;ent; but before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e reached England, he would give me an opportunity of taking them out. I was &s;ati&s;f|ied with this an&s;wer, and we pur&s;ued our voyage.</P>
<P>The company in the cabin were all very &s;o|ciable, and we were perfectly well off as to pro|vi&s;ions, as we took the advantage of the whole of Mr. Hamilton's who had laid in a very plentiful &s;tock. During the pa&s;&s;age Mr. Den|ham contracted a friend&s;hip for me, which ended only with his life: in other re&s;pects the voyage was by no means an agreeable one, as we had much bad weather.</P>
<P>When we arrived in the river, the captain was as good as his word, and allowed me to &s;earch the bag for the governor's letters. I could not find a &s;ingle one with my name written on it, as committed to my care; but I &s;elect|ed &s;ix or &s;even, which I judged from the di|rection
<PB N="70" REF="027004_0070_0FD2D76258395310">to be tho&s;e that were intended for me; particularly one to Mr. Ba&s;ket the king's prin|ter, and another to a &s;tationer, who was the fir&s;t per&s;on I called upon. I delivered him the letter as coming from governor Keith. <Q>I have no acquaintance (&s;aid he) with any &s;uch per&s;on;</Q> and opening the letter, <Q>Oh, it is from Riddle&s;den! he exclaimed. I have lately di&s;covered him to be a very arrant knave, and I wi&s;h to have nothing to do either with him or his letters.</Q> He in&s;tantly put the letter in my hand, turned upon his heel, and left me to &s;erve &s;ome cu&s;|tomers.</P>
<P>I was a&s;toni&s;hed at finding the&s;e letters were not from the governor. Reflecting, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ting circum&s;tances together, I then began to doubt his &s;incerity. I rejoined my friend Denham, and related the whole affair to him. He let me at once into Keith's character, told me there was not the lea&s;t probability of his having written a &s;ingle letter; that no one who knew him ever placed any reliance on him, and laughed at my credulity in &s;up|po&s;ing that the governor would give me a letter of credit, when he had no credit for him&s;elf. As I &s;hewed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s re&s;pect|ing what &s;tep I &s;hould take, he advi&s;ed me to try to get employment in the hou&s;e of &s;ome printer. You may there, &s;aid he, improve your&s;elf in bu&s;ine&s;s, and you will be able to &s;ettle your&s;elf the more advantageou&s;ly when you return to America.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="027004_0071_0FD2D76386C4B250">
We knew already, as well as the &s;tationer, attorney Riddle&s;den to be a knave. He had nearly ruined the father of Mi&s;s Read, by drawing him in to be his &s;ecurity. We learned from his letter, that he was &s;ecretly carrying on an entrigue, in concert with the governor, to the prejudice of Mr. Hamilton, who it was &s;uppo&s;ed would by this time be in Europe. Denham, who was Hamilton's friend, was of opinion that he ought to be made acquainted with it: and in reality, the in&s;tant he arrived in England, which was very &s;oon after, I waited on him, and, as much from good-will to him as from re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the governor, put the letter into his hands. He thanked me very &s;incerely, the information it contained being of con&s;e|quence to him; and from that moment be|&s;towed on me his friend&s;hip, which after|wards proved on many occa&s;ions &s;erviceable to me.</P>
<P>But what are we to think of a governor who could play &s;o &s;curvy a trick, and thus gro&s;sly deceive a poor young lad, wholly de&s;|titute of experience? It was a practice with him. Wi&s;hing to plea&s;e every body, and having little to be&s;tow, he was lavi&s;h of pro|mi&s;es. He was in other re&s;pects &s;en&s;ible and judicious, a very tolerable writer, and a good governor for the people; though not &s;o for the proprietaries, who&s;e in&s;tructions he fre|quently di&s;regarded.

<P>I was employed at Palmer's on the &s;econd adition of Woola&s;ton's Religion of Nature.

<PB N="74" REF="027004_0074_0FD2D769CB45F898">price, I &s;hould have free acce&s;s to his library, and take what books I plea&s;ed, which I was to return when I had read them. I con&s;idered this agreement as a very great advantage; and I derived from it as much benefit as was in my power.</P>
<P>My pamphlet falling into the hands of a &s;urgeon, of the name of Lyons, author of a book entitled Infallibility of Human Judg|ment, was the occa&s;ion of a con&s;iderable in|timacy between us. He expre&s;&s;ed great e&s;teem for me, came frequently to &s;ee me, it order to conver&s;e upon metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects, and introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, au|thor of the Fable of Bees, who had in&s;ti|tuted a club at a tavern in Cheap&s;ide, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which he was the &s;oul: he was a facetious and very amu&s;ing character. He al&s;o intro|duced me, at Ba&s;ton's coffee-hou&s;e, to Dr. Pemberton, who promi&s;ed to give me an op|portunity of &s;eeing Sir I&s;aac Newton, which I very ardently de&s;ired; but he never kept his word.</P>
<P>I had brought &s;ome curio&s;ities with me from America; the principal of which was a pur&s;e made of A&s;be&s;tos, which fire only puri|fies. Sir Hans Sloane hearing of it, called upon me, and invited me to his hou&s;e in Bloom&s;bury &s;quare, where, after &s;howing me every thing that was curious, he prevail|ed on me to add this piece to his collection&punc; for which he paid me very hand&s;omely.</P>
<P>There lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with us a
<PB N="75" REF="027004_0075_0FD2D76C31D337F0">young woman, a milliner, who had a &s;hop by the &s;ide of the Exchange. Lively and &s;en&s;ible, and having received an education &s;omewhat above her rank, her conver&s;ation was very agreeable. Ralph read plays to her every evening. They became intimate. She took another lodging, and he followed her. They lived for &s;ome time together; but Ralph being without employment, &s;he having a child, and the profits of her bu&s;ine&s;s not &s;ufficing for the maintenance of three, he re&s;olved to quit London, and try a country &s;chool. This was a plan in which he thought him&s;elf likely to &s;ucceed, as he wrote a fine hand, and was ver&s;ed in arithmetic and ac|counts. But con&s;idering the office as be|neath him, and expecting &s;ome day to make a better figure in the world, when he &s;hould be a&s;hamed of its being known that he had exerci&s;ed a profe&s;&s;ion &s;o little honourable, he changed his name, and did me the honour of a&s;&s;uming mine. He wrote to me &s;oon af|ter his departure, informing me that he was &s;ettled at a &s;mall village in Berk&s;hire. In his letter he recommended Mrs. T***, the mil|liner, to my care, and reque&s;ted an an&s;wer, directed to Mr. Franklin, &s;choolma&s;ter at N***.</P>
<P>He continued to write to me frequently, &s;ending me large fragments of an epic poem he was compo&s;ing, and which he reque&s;ted me to critici&s;e and correct. I did &s;o, but not without endeavouring to prevail on him
<PB N="76" REF="027004_0076_0FD2D76D9E781838">to renounce this pur&s;uit. Young had ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> publi&s;hed one of his Satires. I copied and &s;ent him a great part of it; in which the au|thor demon&s;trates the folly of cultivating the Mu&s;es, from the hope, by their in&s;trumen|tality, of ri&s;ing in the world. It was all to no purpo&s;e; paper after paper of his poem continued to arrive every po&s;t.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Mrs. T*** having lo&s;t, on his account, both her friends and her bu&s;ine&s;s was frequently in di&s;tre&s;s. In this dilemma &s;he had recour&s;e to me; and to extricate her from her difficulties, I lent her all the money I could &s;pare. I felt a little too much fond|ne&s;s for her. Having at that time no ties of religion, and taking advantage of her ne|ce&s;&s;itous &s;ituation, I attempted liberties (ano|ther error of my life) which &s;he repelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with becoming indignation. She informed Ralph of my conduct; and the affair oc|ca&s;ioned a breach between us. When he re|turned to London, he gave me to under&s;tand that he con&s;idered all the obligations he ow|ed me as annihilated by this proceeding&punc; whence I concluded that I was never to ex|pect the payment of what money I had lent him, or advanced on his account. I was the le&s;s afflicted at this, as he was unable to pay me; and as, by lo&s;ing his friend&s;hip, I was relieved at the &s;ame time from a very heavy burthen.</P>
<P>I now began to think of laying by &s;ome money. The printing-hou&s;e of Watts, near
<PB N="77" REF="027004_0077_0FD2D76EC9B7D6B8">Lincoln's Inn-Fields, being a &s;till more con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">derable one than that in which I worked, it was probable I might find it more ad|vantageous to be employed there. I offered my&s;elf, and was accepted; and in this hou&s;e I continued during the remainder of my &s;tay in London.</P>
<P>On my entrance I worked at fir&s;t as a pre&s;&s;|man, conceiving that I had need of bodily exerci&s;e, to which I had been accu&s;tomed in America, where the printers work al|ternately as compo&s;itors and at the pre&s;s|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> drank nothing but water. The other workmen, to the number of about fifty, were great drinkers of beer. I carried oc|ca&s;ionally a large form of letters in each hand, up and down &s;tairs, while the re&s;t employed both hands to carry one. They were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, by this and many other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">amples, that the <HI>American Aquatic,</HI> as they u&s;ed to call me, was &s;tronger than tho&s;e who drank porter. The beer-boy had &s;ufficient employment during the whole day in &s;erv|ing that hou&s;e alone. My fellow-pre&s;&s;man drank every day a pint of beer before break|fa&s;t, a pint with bread and chee&s;e for break|fa&s;t, one between breakfa&s;t and dinner, one at dinner, one again about &s;ix o'clock in the afternoon, and another after he had fini&s;hed his day's work. This cu&s;tom appeared to me abominable; but he had need, he &s;aid, of all this beer, in order to acquire &s;trength to work.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027004_0078_0FD2D77046815820">
I endeavoured to convince him that bodily &s;trength furni&s;hed by beer, could only be in proportion to the &s;olid part of the barley di&s;|&s;olved in the water of which the beer was compo&s;ed; that there was a larger portion of flour in a penny loaf, and that con&s;equently if he eat this loaf, and drank a pint of water with it, he would derive more &s;trength from it than from a pint of beer. This rea&s;oning, however, did not prevent him from drinking his accu&s;tomed quantity of beer, and paying every Saturday night a &s;core of four or five &s;hillings a week for this cur&s;ed beverage; an expence from which I was wholly exempt. Thus do the&s;e poor devils continue all their lives in a &s;tate of voluntary wretchedne&s;s and poverty.</P>
<P>At the end of a few weeks, Watts having occa&s;ion for me above &s;tairs as a compo&s;itor, I quitted the pre&s;s. The compo&s;itors demanded of me garni&s;h-money afre&s;h. This I con&s;idered as an impo&s;ition, having already paid below. The ma&s;ter was of the &s;ame opinion, and de|&s;ired me not to comply. I thus remained two or three weeks out of the fraternity. I was con&s;equently looked upon as excommunicat|ed; and whenever I was ab&s;ent, no little trick that malice could &s;ugge&s;t was left unpracti&s;ed upon me. I found my letters mixed, my pa|ges tran&s;po&s;ed, my matter broken, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which was attributed to the &s;pirit that
<PB N="79" REF="027004_0079_0FD2D7729475EA40">haunted the chapel,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printing-hou&s;es in general are thus denominated by the workmen; the &s;pirit they call by the name of Ralph.</NOTE> and tormented tho&s;e who were not regularly admitted. I was at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit to pay, notwith&s;tanding the protection of the ma&s;ter; convinced of the folly of not keeping up a good under&s;tand|ing with tho&s;e among whom we were de&s;tined to live.</P>
<P>After this I lived in the utmo&s;t harmony with my fellow-labourers, and &s;oon acquired con&s;iderable influence among them. I pro|po&s;ed &s;ome alterations in the laws of the cha|pel, which I carried without oppo&s;ition. My example prevailed with &s;everal of them to renounce their abominable practice of bread and chee&s;e with beer; and they procured, like me, from a neighbouring hou&s;e, a good ba&s;on of warm gruel, in which was a &s;mall &s;lice of butter, with toa&s;ted bread and nut|meg. This was a much better breakfa&s;t, which did not co&s;t more than a pint of beer, name|ly, three-halfpence, and at the &s;ame time pre|&s;erved the head clearer. Tho&s;e who continu|ed to gorge them&s;elves with beer, often lo&s;t their credit with the publican, from neglect|ing to pay their &s;core. They had then recour&s;e to me, to become &s;ecurity for them; <HI>their light,</HI> as they u&s;ed to call it, <HI>being out.</HI> I at|tended at the pay-table every Saturday even|ing, to take up the little &s;um which I had made my&s;elf an&s;werable for; and which &s;ome|times
<PB N="80" REF="027004_0080_0FD2D7753897E658">amounted to near thirty &s;hillings a week.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, added to my reputation of being a tolerable good <HI>gabber,</HI> or, in other words, &s;kilful in the art of burle&s;que, kept up my importance in the chapel. I had be&s;ides recommended my&s;elf to the e&s;teem of my ma&s;ter by my a&s;&s;iduous application to bu&s;ine&s;s never ob&s;erving Saint Monday. My extra|ordinary quickne&s;s in compo&s;ing always pro|cured me &s;uch work as was mo&s;t urgent, and which is commonly be&s;t paid; and thus my time pa&s;&s;ed away in a very plea&s;ant manner.</P>
<P>My lodging in Little Britain being to far from the printing-hou&s;e, I took another in Duke-&s;treet, oppo&s;ite the Roman Chapel. It was the back of an Italian warehou&s;e. The hou&s;e was kept by a widow, who had a daugh|ter, a &s;ervant, and a &s;hop boy; but the latter &s;lept out of the hou&s;e. After &s;ending to the people with whom I lodged in Little Britain, to enquire into my character, &s;he agreed to take me at the &s;ame price, three-and-&s;ixpence a week; contenting her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, with &s;o little, becau&s;e of the &s;ecurity &s;he would derive, as they were all women, from having a man to lodge in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was a woman rather advanced in life, the daughter of a clergyman. She had been educated a Prote&s;tant; but her hu&s;band, who&s;e memory &s;he highly revered, had converted her to the Catholic religion. She had lived in habits of intimacy with per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion;
<PB N="81" REF="027004_0081_0FD2D77946660BD8">of whom &s;he knew various anecdotes as far back as the time of Charles II. Being &s;ubject to fits of the gout, which often confi|ned her to her room, &s;he was &s;ometimes di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;ee company. Hers was &s;o amu&s;ing to me, that I was glad to pa&s;s the evening with her as often as &s;he de&s;ired it. Our &s;up|per con&s;i&s;ted only of half an anchovy a piece, upon a &s;lice of bread and butter, with half a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt of ale between us. But the entertain|ment was in her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The early hours I kept, and the little trou|ble I occa&s;ioned in the family, made her loath to part with me; and when I mentioned an|other loding I had found, nearer the printing-hou&s;e, at two &s;hillings a week, which fell in with my plan of &s;aving, &s;he per&s;uaded me to give it up, making her&s;elf an abatement of two &s;hillings: and thus I continued to lodge with her, during the remainder of my abode in London, at eighteen-pence a week.</P>
<P>In a garret of the hou&s;e there lived, in the mo&s;t retired manner, a lady &s;eventy years of age, of whom I received the following ac|count from my landlady. She was a Roman Catholic. In her early years &s;he had been &s;ent to the continent, and entered a convent with the de&s;ign of becoming a nun; but the climate not agreeing with her con&s;titution, &s;he was obliged to return to England, where, as there were no mona&s;teries, &s;he made a vow to lead a mona&s;tic life, in as rigid a manner as circum&s;tances would permit. She accord|ingly
<PB N="82" REF="027004_0082_0FD2D74FF5C4FFD8">di&s;po&s;ed of her property to be applied to charitable u&s;es, re&s;erving to her&s;elf only twelve pounds a year; and of this &s;mall pit|tance &s;he gave a part to the poor, living on water-gruel, and never making u&s;e of fire but to boil it. She had lived in this garret a great many years, without paying rent to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Catholic inhabitants that had kept the hou&s;e; who indeed con&s;idered her abode with them as a ble&s;&s;ing. A prie&s;t came every day to confe&s;s her. I have a&s;ked her, &s;aid my landlady, how, living as &s;he did, &s;he could find &s;o much employment for a confe&s;&s;or? To which &s;he an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid vain thoughts.</P>
<P>I was once permitted to vi&s;it her. She was cheerful and polite, and her conver&s;ation a|greeable. Her apartment was neat; but the whole furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a mattra&s;s, a table, on which were a crucifix and a book, a chair, which &s;he gave me to &s;it on, and over the mantle-piece a picture of St. Veroni|ca di&s;playing her handkerchief, on which was &s;een the miraculous impre&s;&s;ion of the face of Chri&s;t, which &s;he explained to me with great gravity. Her countenance was pale, but &s;he had never experienced &s;ickne&s;s; and I may adduce her as another proof how little is &s;uf|ficient to maintain life and health.</P>
<P>At the printing-hou&s;e I contracted an inti|macy with a &s;en&s;ible young man of the name of Wygate, who, as his parents were in good circum&s;tances, had received a better education
<PB N="83" REF="027004_0083_0FD2D77C4927B060">than is common with printers. He was a tol|erable Latin &s;cholar, &s;poke French fluently, and was fond of reading. I taught him, as well as a friend of his, to &s;wim, by taking them twice only into the river; after which they &s;tood in need of no farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We one day made a party to go by water to Chel&s;ea, in order to &s;ee the College, and Don Soltero's curio&s;ities. On our return, at the reque&s;t of the company, who&s;e curio&s;ity Wy|gate had excited, I undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and leap|ed into the river. I &s;wam from near Chel&s;ea the whole way to Black-friars Bridge, exhib|iting, during my cour&s;e, a variety of feats of activity and addre&s;s, both upon the &s;urface of the water, as well as under it. This &s;ight oc|ca&s;ioned much a&s;toni&s;hment and plea&s;ure to tho&s;e to whom it was new. In my youth I took great delight in this exerci&s;e. I knew, and could execute, all the evolutions and po|&s;itions of Thevenot; and I added to them &s;ome of my own invention, in which I endeav|oured to unite gracefulne&s;s and untility. I took a plea&s;ure in di&s;playing them all on this occa&s;ion, and was highly flattered with the ad|miration they excited.</P>
<P>Wygate, be&s;ides his being de&s;irous of per|fecting him&s;elf in this art, was the more at|tached to me from there being, in order re|&s;pects, a conformity in our ta&s;tes and &s;tudies. He at length propo&s;ed to me to make the tour of Europe with him, maintaining our&s;elves at the &s;ame time by working at our profe&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="84" REF="027004_0084_0FD2D780C4F57478">I was on the-point of con&s;enting, when I men|tioned it to my friend Denham, with whom I was glad to pa&s;s an hour whenever I had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ure. He di&s;&s;uaded me from the project, and advi&s;ed me to return to Philadelphia which he was about to do him&s;elf. I mu&s;t relate in this place a trait of this worthy man's character.</P>
<P>He had formerly been in bu&s;ine&s;s at Bri&s;tol, but failing, he compounded with his creditors and departed for America, where, by a&s;&s;i|duous application as a merchant, he acquir|ed in a few years a very con&s;iderable fortune. Returning to England in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el with my&s;elf, as I have related above, he invited all his old creditors to a fea&s;t. When a&s;&s;em|bled, he thanked them for the readine&s;s with which they had received his &s;mall compo&s;itions and, while they expected nothing more than a &s;imple entertainment, each found under his plate, when it came to be removed, a draft upon a banker for the re&s;idue of his debt with intere&s;t.</P>
<P>He told me it was his intention to cary back with him to Philadelphia a great quantity of goods, in order to open a &s;tore; and he of|fered to take me with him in the capacity of a clerk, to keep his books, in which he would in&s;truct me, copy letters and &s;uperintend the &s;tore. He added, that, as &s;oon as I had ac|quired a knowledge of mercantile tran&s;actions, he would improve my &s;ituation by &s;ending me with a cargo of corn and flour to the A|merican i&s;lands, and by procuring me other
<PB N="85" REF="027004_0085_0FD2D7849430ABB0">lucrative commi&s;&s;ions; &s;o that, with good ma|nagement and economy, I might in time be|gin bu&s;ine&s;s with advantage for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I reli&s;hed the&s;e propo&s;als. London began to tire me; the agreeable hours I had pa&s;&s;ed at Philadelphia pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my mind, and I had wi&s;hed to &s;ee them re|vive. I con&s;equently engaged my&s;elf to Mr. Denham, at a &s;alary of fifty pounds a year. This was indeed le&s;s than I earned as a compo&s;itor, but then I had a much fairer pro&s;pect. I took leave, therefore, as I be|lieved forever, of printing, and gave my&s;elf up entirely to my new occupation, &s;pending all my time either in going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e with Mr. Denham to purcha&s;e goods, or in packing them up, or in expediting the workmen, &amp;c. &amp;c. When every thing was on board, I had at la&s;t a few days lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>During this interval, I was one day &s;ent for by a gentleman, whom I knew only by name. It was Sir William Wyndham. I went to his hou&s;e. He had by &s;ome means heard of my performances between Chel&s;ea and Black|friers, and that I had taught the art of &s;wim|ming to Wygate and another young man in the cour&s;e of a few hours. His two &s;ons were on the point of &s;etting out on their travels; he was de&s;irous that they &s;hould previou&s;ly learn to &s;wim, and offered me a very liberal reward if I would undertake to in&s;truct them. They were not yet arrived in town, and the &s;tay I &s;hould make my&s;elf was uncertain;
<PB N="86" REF="027004_0086_0FD2D785F7B801F0">I coud not therefore accept his propo&s;al. I was led however to &s;uppo&s;e from this in|cident, that if I had wi&s;hed to remain in London, and open a &s;wimming-&s;chool, I &s;hould perhaps have gained a great deal of money. This idea &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, that, had the offer been made &s;ooner, I &s;hould have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the thoughts of return|ing as yet to America. Some years after, you and I had a more important bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle with one of the &s;ons of Sir William Windham, then Lord Egremont. But let us not anticipate events.</P>
<P>I thus pa&s;&s;ed a bout eighteen months in London, working almo&s;t without inter|mi&s;&s;ion at my trade, avoiding all expence on my own account, excepting going now and then to a play, and purcha&s;ing a few books. But my friend Ralph kept me poor. He owed me about twenty-&s;even pounds, which was &s;o much money lo&s;t; and when con&s;ider|ed taken from my little &s;avings, was a very great &s;um. I had, notwith&s;tanding this, a regard for him, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many amiable qualities. But though I had done nothing for my&s;elf in point of fortune, I had increa&s;|ed my &s;tock of knowledge, either by the many excellent books I had read, or the con|ver&s;ation of learned or literary per&s;ons with whom I was acquinted.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed from Grave&s;end the 23d of July 1726. For the incidents of my voyage I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|fer you to my Journal, where you will fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="87" REF="027004_0087_0FD2D788848DAA28">all the circum&s;tances minutely related. We landed at Philadelphia on the 11th of the following October.</P>
<P>Keith had been deprived of his office of go|vernor, and was &s;ucceeded by Major Gordon. I met him walking in the &s;treets as a private individual. He appeared a little a&s;hamed at &s;eeing me, but pa&s;&s;ed on without &s;aying any thing.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been equally a&s;hamed my|&s;elf at meeting Mi&s;s Read, had not her family, ju&s;tly de&s;paring of my return after reading my letter, advi&s;ed her to give me up, and marry a potter, of the name of Rogers; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;he con&s;ented: but he never made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> happy, and &s;he &s;oon &s;eperated from him, re|fu&s;ing to cohabit with him, or even bate his name, on account of a report which pre|vailed, of his having another wife. His &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion had &s;educed Mi&s;s Read's, pa|rents; but he was as bad a &s;ubject as he was excellent as a workman. He involved him&s;elf i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> debt, and fled, in the year 1727 or 1728 to the We&s;t-Indies, were he died.</P>
<P>During my ab&s;ence Keimer had taken a more con&s;iderable hou&s;e, in which he kept a &s;hop, that was well &s;upplied with paper, and various other articles. He had produced &s;ome new tipes, and a number of workmen; a|mong whom, however, there was not one who was good for any thing; and he appear|ed not to want bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Denham took a warehou&s;e in Water-&s;treet,
<PB N="88" REF="027004_0088_0FD2D78A02F3C490">where we exhibited our commodities. I applied my&s;elf clo&s;ely, &s;tudied accounts, and became in a &s;hort time very expert in trade. We lodged and eat together. He was &s;incerely attached to me, and acted to|wards me as if he had been my father. On my &s;ide, I re&s;pected and loved him. My &s;itu|ation was happy; but it was a happine&s;s of no long duration.</P>
<P>Early in February 1727, when I entered into my twenty-&s;econd year, we were both taken ill. I was attacked with a pleuri&s;y, which had nearly carried me off; I &s;uffered terribly, and con&s;idered it as all over with me. I felt indeed a &s;ort of di&s;appointment when I found my&s;elf likely to recover, and regretted that had &s;till to experience, &s;ooner or later, the &s;ame di&s;agreeable &s;cene again.</P>
<P>I have forgotten what was Mr. Denham's di&s;order; but it was a tedious one, and at la&s;t &s;unk under it. He left me a &s;mall legacy in his will, as a te&s;timony of his friend&s;hip; and I was once more abandoned to my&s;elf in the wide world, the warehou&s;e being confided to the care of the te&s;tamentary executor, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>My brother-in-law, Holmes, who happen|ed to be at Philadelphia, advi&s;ed me to return to my former profe&s;&s;ion; and Keimer offered me a very con&s;iderable &s;alary if I would un|dertake the management of his printing-office, that he might devote him&s;elf entirely to the &s;uperintendance of his &s;hop. His wife and
<PB N="89" REF="027004_0089_0FD2D78C8221FD70">relations in London had given me a bad cha|racter of him; and I was loath, for the pre|&s;ent, to have any concern with him. I en|deavoured to get employment as a clerk to a merchant; but not readily finding a &s;ituation, I was induced to accept Keimer's propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The following were the per&s;ons I found in his printing-hou&s;e:</P>
<P>Hugh Meredith, a Penn&s;ylvanian, about thirty-five years of age. He had been brought up to hu&s;bandry, was hone&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, had &s;ome experience, and was fond of reading: but too much addicted to drinking.</P>
<P>Stephen Potts, a young ru&s;tic, ju&s;t broke from &s;chool, and of ru&s;tic education, with endowments rather above the common order, and a competent portion of under&s;tanding and gaiety; but a little idle. Keimer had en|gaged the&s;e two at very low wages, which he had promi&s;ed to rai&s;e every three months a &s;hilling a week, provided their improvement in the typographic art &s;hould merit it. This future increa&s;e of wages was the bait he made u&s;e of to en&s;nare them. Meredith was to work at the pre&s;s, and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts to bind books, which he had engaged to teach them, though he under&s;tood neither him&s;elf.</P>
<P>John Savage, an Iri&s;hman, who had been brought up to no trade, and who&s;e &s;ervice, for a period of four years, Keimer had pur|cha&s;ed of the captain of a &s;hip. He was al&s;o to be a pre&s;&s;man.</P>
<P>George Webb, an Oxford &s;cholar, who&s;e
<PB N="90" REF="027004_0090_0FD2D78EF87ED460">time he had in like manner bought for four years, intending him for a compo&s;itor. I &s;hall &s;peak more of him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, David Harry, a country la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who was apprenticed to him.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceived that Keimer's intention, in engaging me at a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;o much above what he was accu&s;tomed to give, was, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> I might form all the&s;e raw journeymen and apprentices, who &s;carcely co&s;t him any thing, and who, being indentured, would, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, ena|ble him to do without me. I neverthele&s;s ad|hered to my agreement. I put the office in order, which was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and brought his people, by degrees, to pay attention to their work, and to execute it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a more ma&s;terly manner.</P>
<P>It was &s;ingular to &s;ee an Oxford &s;cholar in the condition of a purcha&s;ed &s;ervant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and the following are the particulars he gave me of him&s;elf. Born at Glouce&s;ter, he had been educated at a grammar &s;chool, and had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf among the &s;cholars by his &s;uperior &s;tyle of acting, when they repre|&s;ented dramatic performances. He was mem|ber of a literary club in the town; and &s;ome pieces of his compo&s;ition, in pro&s;e as well as in ver&s;e, had been in&s;erted in the Glouce&s;ter papers. From hence he was &s;ent to Oxford, where he remained about a year; but he was not con&s;ented; and wi&s;hed above all things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="91" REF="027004_0091_0FD2D7908436CBE0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e London, and become an actor. At length, having received fifteen guineas to pay his quar|ter's board, he decamped with the money from Oxford, hid his gown in a hedge, and travelled to London. There, having no friend to direct him, he fell into bad company, &s;oon &s;quandered his fifteen guineas, could find no way of be|ing introduced to the actors, became con|temptible, pawned his clothes, and was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt of bread. As he was walking along the &s;treets, almo&s;t fami&s;hed with hunger, and not knowing what to do, a recruiting bill was put into his hand, which offered an immedi|ate treat and bounty-money to whoever was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve in America. He in&s;tantly repaired to the hou&s;e of rendezvous, inli&s;ted him&s;elf, was put on board a &s;hip and convey|ed to America, without ever writing to inform his parents what was become of him. His mental vivacity, and good natural di&s;po&s;ition, made him an excellent companion; but he be was indolent, thoughtle&s;s, and to the la&s;t degree imprudent.</P>
<P>John, the Iri&s;hman, &s;oon ran away. I be|gan to live very agreeably with the re&s;t. They in&s;pected me, and the more &s;o as they found Keimer incapable of in&s;tructing them, and as they learned &s;omething from me every day. We never worked on a Saturday, it being Keimer's &s;abbath; &s;o that I had two days a week for reading.</P>
<P>I increa&s;ed my acquaintance with per&s;ons of knowledge and information in the town.
<PB N="92" REF="027004_0092_0FD2D79279BC78C8">Keimer him&s;elf treated me with great civilit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and apparent e&s;teem; and I had nothing to give me unea&s;ine&s;s but my debt to Vernon, which I was unable to pay, my &s;avings as yet being very little. He had the goodne&s;s, how|ever, not to a&s;k me for the money.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;s was frequently in want of the nece&s;&s;ary quanty of letter; and there was no &s;uch trade as that of letter-founder in America I had &s;een the practice of this art at the hou&s;e of James, in London; but at the &s;ame time paid it very little attention. I however contrived to fabricate a mould. I made u&s;e of &s;uch let|ters of lead in matrices of clay, and thus &s;up|plied, in a tolerable manner, the wants that were mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I al&s;o, upon occa&s;ion, engraved various or|naments, made ink, gave an eye to the &s;hop; in &s;hort, I was in every re&s;pect the <HI>factotum.</HI> But u&s;eful as I made my&s;elf, I perceived that my &s;ervices became every day of le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s impor|tance, in proportion as the other men impro|ved; and when Keimer paid me my &s;econd quarter's wages, he gave me to under&s;tand that they were too heavy, and that he thought I ought to make an abatement. He became by degrees le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s civil, and a&s;&s;umed more the tone of ma&s;ter. He frequently found fault, was difficult to plea&s;e, and &s;eemed always on the point of coming to an open quarrel with me.</P>
<P>I continued, however, to bear it patiently, conceiving that his ill-humour was partly oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="93" REF="027004_0093_0FD2D793811340D8">by the derangement and embarra&s;&s;|ment of his affairs. At la&s;t a &s;light incident broke our connection. Hearing a noi&s;e in the neighbourhood, I put my head out of the window to &s;ee what was the matter. Keimer being in the &s;treet, ob&s;erved me, and in a lound an angry tone, told me to mind my work; adding &s;ome reproachful words, which piqued me the more as they were uttered in the &s;treet; and the neighbours, whom the &s;ame noi&s;e had attracted to the windows, were witne&s;&s;es of the manner in which I was treat|ed. He immediately came up to the printing-room, and continued to exclaim again&s;t me. The quarrel became warm on both &s;ides, and he gave me notice to quit him at the expira|tion of three months, as had been agreed be|tween us; regretting that he was obliged to give me &s;o long a term. I told him that his regret was &s;uperfluous, as I was ready to quit him in&s;tantly; and I took my hat and came out of the hou&s;e, begging Meredith to take care of &s;ome things which I left, and bring them to my lodgings.</P>
<P>Meredith came to me in the evening. We talked for &s;ome time upon the quarrel that had taken place. He had conceived a great veneration for me, and was &s;orry I &s;hould quit the hou&s;e while he remained in it. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;|&s;uaded me from returning to my native coun|try, as I began to think of doing. He remind|ed me that Keimer owed more than he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed; that his creditors began to be alarmed;
<PB N="94" REF="027004_0094_0FD2D7981A2B5F10">that he kept his &s;hop in a wretched &s;tate, of|ten &s;elling things at prime co&s;t for the &s;ake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ready money, and continually giving credit without keeping any accounts; that of con|&s;equence he mu&s;t very &s;oon fail, which would occa&s;ion a vacancy from which I might derive advantage. I objected my want of money. Upon which he informed me that his father had a very high oppinion of me, and, from a conver&s;ation that had pa&s;&s;ed between them, he was &s;ure that he would advance whatever might be nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if I was willing to enter into partner&s;hip with him. "My time with Keimer," added he "will be at an end next &s;pring. In the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> time we may &s;end to London for our pre&s;s a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> types. I know that I am no workman; but if you agree to the propo&s;al, your &s;kill in the bu&s;ine&s;s will be balanced by the capital I will furni&s;h, and we will &s;hare the profits equally. His propo&s;al was rea&s;onable, and I fell in with it. His father, who was then in the tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, approved of it. He knew that I had &s;ome a&s;|cendency over his &s;on, as I had been able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prevail on him to ab&s;tain a long time from drinking brandy; and he hoped that, when more clo&s;ely connected with him, I &s;hould cure him entirely of this unfortunate habit.</P>
<P>I gave the father a li&s;t of what it would be nece&s;&s;ary to import from London. He took it to a merchant, and the order was given. We agreed to keep the &s;ecret till the arrival of the materials, and I was in the mean time
<PB N="95" REF="027004_0095_0FD2D79C9ED61E88">is procure work, if po&s;&s;ible, in another prin|ting-hou&s;e; but there was no place vacant, and I remained idle. After &s;ome days, Keimer having the expectation of being employed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt &s;ome New-Jer&s;ey money-bills, that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quire types and engravings which I only could furni&s;h, and fearful that Bradford, by engaging me, might deprive him of the un|dertaking, &s;ent me a very civil me&s;&s;age, tel|ling me that old friends ought not to be di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted on account of a few words, which were the effect only of a momentary pa&s;&s;ion, and inviting me to return to him. Meredith per|&s;uaded me to comply with the invitation, par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ularly as it would afford him more oppor|tunities of improving him&s;elf in the bu&s;ine&s;s by means of my in&s;tructions. I did &s;o, and we lived upon better terms than before our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">paration.</P>
<P>He obtained the New-Jer&s;ey bu&s;ine&s;s; and, in order to execute it, I con&s;tructed a copper|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">te printing-pre&s;s; the fir&s;t that had been &s;een in the country. I engraved various or|naments and vignettes for the bills; and we repaired to Burlington together, where I ex|ecuted the whole to the general &s;atisfaction; and he received a &s;um of money for his work, which enabled him to keep his head above water for a con&s;iderable time longer.</P>
<P>At Burlington I formed acquaintance with the principal per&s;onages of the province; ma|ny of whom were commi&s;&s;ioned by the A&s;&s;em|bly to &s;uperintend the pre&s;s, and to &s;ee that
<PB N="96" REF="027004_0096_0FD2D7A05FB412D8">no more bills were printed than the law had pre&s;cribed. Accordingly they were con&s;tant|ly with us, each in his turn; and he that came commonly brought with him a friend or two to bear him company. My mind was more cultivated by reading than Keimer's; and it was for this rea&s;on, probably, that they &s;et more value on my conver&s;ation. They took me to their hou&s;es, introduced me to their friends, and treated me with the greate&s;t ci|vility; while Keimer, though ma&s;ter, &s;aw him&s;elf a little neglected. He was, in fact, a &s;trange animal, ignorant of the common modes of life, apt to oppo&s;e with rudene&s;s, generally received opinions, an enthu&s;ia&s;t in certain points of religion, di&s;gu&s;tingly un|clean in his per&s;on, and a little knavi&s;h withal.</P>
<P>We remain there nearly three months; and at the expiration of this period I could include in the li&s;t of my friends, Judge Allen, Sam|uel Bu&s;til, &s;ecretary of the province, I&s;aac Pear&s;on, Jo&s;eph Cooper, &s;everal of the Smiths, all members of the A&s;&s;embly, and I&s;aac Dea|con, in&s;pector-general. The la&s;t was a &s;hrewd and &s;ubtle old man. He told me, that, when a boy, his fir&s;t employment had been that of carrying clay to brick-makers; that he did not learn to write till he was &s;omewhat advan|ced in life; that he was afterwards employed as an underling to a &s;urveyor, who taught him his trade, and that by indu&s;try he had at la&s;t acquired a competent fortune. "I for-&s;ee,"
<PB N="97" REF="027004_0097_0FD2D7A1CF280528">&s;aid he, one day to me, "that you will &s;oon &s;upplant this man," &s;peaking of Keimer, "and get a fortune in the bu&s;ine&s;s at Phila|delphia." He was totally ignorant at the time of my intention of e&s;tabli&s;hing my&s;elf there, or any where el&s;e. The&s;e friends were very &s;erviceable to me in the end, as was I al&s;o, upon occa&s;ion, to &s;ome of them; and they have continued ever &s;ince their e&s;teem for me.</P>
<P>Before I relate the particulars of my en|trance into bu&s;ine&s;s, it may be proper to in|form you what was at that time the &s;tate of my mind as to moral principles, that you may &s;ee the degree of influence they had upon the &s;ub&s;equent events of my life.</P>
<P>My parents had given me betimes religious impre&s;&s;ions; and I received from my infan|cy a pious education in the principles of Cal|vini&s;m. But &s;carcely was I arrived at fifteen years of age, when, after having doubted in turn of different tenets, according as I found them combated in the different books that I read, I began to doubt of revelation it&s;elf. Some volumes again&s;t dei&s;m fell into my hands. They were &s;aid to be the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;ermons preached at Boyle's lecture. It happened that they produced on me an effect preci&s;ely the rever&s;e of what was intended by the writers; for the arguments of the dei&s;ts, which were cited in order to be refuted, appeared to me much more forcible than the refutation it&s;elf. In a word I &s;oon became a perfect dei&s;t. My
<PB N="98" REF="027004_0098_0FD2D7A3D2F689B8">arguments &s;oon perverted &s;ome other young per&s;ons; particularly Collins and Ralph. But in the &s;equel, when I recollected that they had both u&s;ed me extremely ill, with|out the &s;malle&s;t remor&s;e; when I con&s;i|dered the behaviour of Keith, another free-thinker, and my conduct towards Vernon and Mi&s;s Read, which at times gave me much un|ea&s;ine&s;s, I was led to &s;u&s;pect that this doctrine, though it might be true, was not very u&s;eful. I began to entertain a le&s;s favourable opinion of my London pamphlet, to which I had pre|fixed, as a motto, the following lines of Dry|den;
<Q><L>Whatever is, is right; tho' purblind man</L>
<L>Sees but part of the chain, the neare&s;t link,</L>
<L>His eyes not carrying to the unequal beam</L>
<L>That poi&s;es all above.</L></Q>
and of which the object was to prove, from the arttributes of God, his goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and power, that there could be on &s;uch thing as evil in the world: that vice and virtue did not in reality exi&s;t, and were nothing more than vain di&s;tinctions. I no longer re|garded it as &s;o blamele&s;s a work as I had for|merly imagined; and I &s;u&s;pected &s;ome error mu&s;t have imperceptibly have glided into my argument, by all the inferences I had drawn from it had been affected, as frequently hap|pens in metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings. In a word, I was at la&s;t convinced that truth, probity, and &s;incerity, in tran&s;actions between man and man, were of the utmo&s;t importance to
<PB N="99" REF="027004_0099_0FD2D7A4CED02CE0">the happine&s;s of life; and I re&s;olved from that moment, and wrote the re&s;olution in my journal, to practi&s;e them as long as I lived.</P>
<P>Revelation indeed, as &s;uch, had no influ|ence on my mind; but I was of opinion that, though certain actions could not be bad merely becau&s;e revelation prohibited them, or good, becau&s;e it enjoined them, yet it was probable that tho&s;e actions were prohibited becau&s;e they were bad for us, or enjoined becau&s;e ad|vantageous in their nature, all things con&s;ider|ed. This per&s;ua&s;ion, divine Providence, or &s;ome guardian angel, and perhaps a concurence of favourable circum&s;tances in their nature, co|operating, pre&s;erved me from all immorality, or gro&s;s and <HI>voluntary</HI> inju&s;tice, to which my want of religion was calculated to expo&s;e me, in the dangerous period of youth, and in the hazardous &s;ituation in which I &s;ometimes found my&s;elf, among &s;trangers, and at a di&s;tance from the eye and admonitions of my father. I may &s;ay <HI>voluntary,</HI> becau&s;e the errors into which I had fallen, had been in a manner the forced re&s;ult either of my own experience, or the di&s;hone&s;ty of others. Thus, before I en|tered on my new career, I had imbibed &s;olid principles, and a character of probity. I knew their value; and I made a &s;olemn engagement with my&s;elf never to depart from them.</P>
<P>I had not long returnd from Burlington before our printing materials arrived from London. I &s;ettled my accounts with Keimer, and quitted him with his own con&s;ent, before
<PB N="100" REF="027004_0100_0FD2DDE62783A190">he had any knowledge of our plan. We found a hou&s;e near the market. We took it; and to render the rent le&s;s burthen &s;ome (it was then twenty-four pounds a-year, but have &s;ince known it to let for &s;eventy;) we admitted Tho|mas Godfrey, glazier, with his family, who ea&s;ed us of a con&s;iderable part of it; and with him we agreed to board.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner unpacked our letters, and put our pre&s;s in order, than a per&s;on of my acquaintance, George Hou&s;e, brought us a countryman, whom he had met in the &s;treet en|quiring for a printer. Our money was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the number of things we had been obliged to procure. The five &s;hillings we received from this countryman, the fir&s;t fruit of our earnings, coming &s;o &s;ea&s;onably, gave me more plea&s;ure than any &s;um I have &s;ince gain|ed; and the recollection of the gratitude I felt on this occa&s;ion to George Hou&s;e, has rendered me often more di&s;po&s;ed, than per|haps I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been, no enco|rage young beginners in trade.</P>
<P>There are in every country moro&s;e beings, who are always progno&s;ticating ruin. There was one of this &s;tamp in Philadelphia. He was a man of fortune, declined in years, had an air of wi&s;dom, and a very grave manner of &s;peaking. His name was Samuel Mickle. I knew him not; but he &s;topped one day at my door, and a&s;ked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing-hou&s;e. Upon my an&s;wering in the affirmative
<PB N="101" REF="027004_0101_0FD2DDE775C34670">he &s;aid he was very &s;orry for me, as it was an expen&s;ive undertaking, and the money that had been laid out upon it would be lo&s;t, Philadelphia being a place falling into decay; its inhabitants having all, or nearly all of them, been obliged to all together their cred|itors. That he knew, from undoubted fact, the circum&s;tances which might lead us to &s;up|po&s;e the contrary, &s;uch as new buildings, and the advanced price of rent, to be deceitful appearances, which in reality contributed to ha&s;ten the general ruin; and he gave me &s;o long a detail of misfortunes, actually exi&s;ting, or which were &s;oon to take place, that he left me almo&s;t in a &s;tate of de&s;pair. Had I known this man before I entered into trade, I &s;hould doubt|le&s;s never have ventured. He however continu|ed to live in this place of decay, and to declaim in the &s;ame &s;tyle, refu&s;ing for many years to buy a hou&s;e, becau&s;e all was going to wreck; and in the end I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him pay five times as much for one as it would co&s;t him had he purcha&s;ed it when he fir&s;t began his lamentations.</P>
<P>I ought to have related, that, during the autumn of the preceding year, I had united the majoirity of well-informed per&s;ons of my acquaintance into a club, which we called by the name of the <HI>Junto,</HI> and the object of which was to improve our under&s;tandings. We met every Friday evening. The regula|tions I drew up, obliged every member to propo&s;e, in his turn, one or more que&s;tions
<PB N="102" REF="027004_0102_0FD2DDE8F39C4F90">upon &s;ome point of morality, politics, or philo&s;ophy, which were to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the &s;ociety; and to read, once in three months, an e&s;&s;ay of his own compo&s;ition, on whate|ver &s;ubject he plea&s;ed. Our debates were under the direction of a pre&s;ident, and were to be dictated only by a &s;incere de&s;ire of truth; the plea&s;ure of di&s;puting, and the vanity of tri|umph having no &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and in order to prevent undue warmth, every expre&s;&s;ion which implied ob&s;tinate adherence to an opinion, and all direct contradiction, were prohibited, under &s;mall pecuniary pe|nalties.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t members of our club were Jo&s;eph Breintnal, who&s;e occupation was that of a &s;crivener. He was a middle-aged man, of a good natural di&s;po&s;ition, &s;trongly attached to his friends, a great lover of poetry, reading every thing that came in his way, and wri|ting tolerably well, ingenious in many little trifles and of an agreeble conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Thomas Godfrey, a &s;kilful, though &s;elf-taught mathematician, and who was after|wards the inventer of what goes by the name of Hadley's dial; but he had little know|ledge out of his own line, and was in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">up|portable in company, always requiring, like the majority of mathematicians that have fallen in my way, an unu&s;ual preci&s;ion in every thing that is &s;aid, continually contra|dicting, or making trifling di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tinctions; a

<P>Nicholas Scull, a &s;urveyor, and who be|came afterwards &s;urveyor-general. He was fond of books, and wrote ver&s;es.</P>
<P>William Par&s;ons, brought up to the trade of a &s;hoemaker, but who, having a ta&s;te for reading, had acquired a profound knowledge of mathematics. He fir&s;t &s;tudied them with a view to a&s;trology, and was afterwards the fir&s;t to laugh at his folly. He al&s;o became &s;urveyor-general.</P>
<P>William Mawgridge, a joiner, and very excellent mechanic; and in other re&s;pects a man of &s;olid under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts and George Webb, of whom I have already &s;poken.</P>
<P>Robert Grace, a young man of fortune; generous, animated, and witty; fond of epi|grams, but more fond of his friends.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, William Coleman, at that time a merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s clerk, and nearly of my own age. He had a cool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r and clearer head, a better heart, and more &s;crupulous morals, than almo&s;t any other per&s;on I ever met with. He became a very re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pectable merchant, and one of our provincial judges. Our friend|&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, without interruption, for more than forty years, till the period of his death; and the club continued to exi&s;t almo&s;t as long.</P>
<P>This was the be&s;t &s;chool of politics and philo&s;ophy that then exi&s;ted in the province; for our que&s;tions, which were read a week
<PB N="104" REF="027004_0104_0FD2DDECCB834FB8">previous to their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, induced us to peru&s;e attentively &s;uch books as were written upon the &s;ubjects propo&s;ed, that we might be able to &s;peak upon them more pertinently. We thus acquired the habit of conver&s;ing more agreeably; every object being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed conformably to our regulations, and in a manner to prevent mutual di&s;gu&s;t. To this circum&s;tance may be attributed the long du|ration of the club; which I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to mention as I proceed.</P>
<P>I have introduced it here, as being one of the means on which I had to count for my &s;ucce&s;s in my bu&s;ine&s;s; every member ex|erting him&s;elf to procure work for us. Breint|nal, among others, obtained for us, on the part of the Quakers, the printing of forty &s;heets of their hi&s;tory; the re&s;t of which was to be done by Keimer. Our execution of this work was by no means ma&s;terly; as the price was very low. It was in folio, upon <HI>pro patria</HI> paper, and in the <HI>pica</HI> letter, with heavy notes in the &s;malle&s;t type. I compo&s;ed a &s;heet a day, and Meredith put it to the pre&s;s. It was frequently eleven o'clock at night, &s;ometimes later, before I had fini&s;hed my di&s;|tribution for the next day's ta&s;k; for the lit|tle things which our friends occa&s;ionally &s;ent us, kept us back in this work: but I was &s;o determined to compo&s;e a &s;heet a day, that one evening, when my form was impo&s;ed, and my day's work as I thought, at an end, an accident having broken this form, and de|ranged
<PB N="105" REF="027004_0105_0FD2DE5BCC901468">two complete folio pages. I immedi|ately di&s;tributed, and compo&s;ed them anew before I went to bed.</P>
<P>This unwearied indu&s;try, which was per|ceived by our neigbours, began to acquire us reputation and credit. I learned, among other things, that our new printing-hou&s;e be|ing the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation at a club of merchants, who met every evening, it was the general opinion that it would fail; there being already two printing-hou&s;es in the town, Keimer's and Bradford's. But Dr. Bard, whom you and I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee, many years after, at his native town of St. Andrew's in Scotland, was of a different opi|nion. "The indu&s;try of this Franklin (&s;aid he, is &s;uperior to any thing of the kind I have ever witne&s;&s;ed. I &s;ee him &s;till at work when I return from the club at night, and he is at it again in the morning before his neigh|bours are out of bed." This account &s;truck the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;hortly after one of its members came to our hou&s;e, and offered to &s;upply us with articles of &s;tationary; but we wi&s;hed not as yet to embarra&s;s our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elves with keeping a &s;hop. It is not for the &s;ake of applau&s;e that I enter &s;o freely into the parti|culars of my indu&s;try, but that &s;uch of my de&s;cendants as &s;hall read there memoirs may know the u&s;e of this virtue, by &s;eeing in the recital of my life the effects it operated in my favour.</P>
<P>George Webb, having found a friend who
<PB N="106" REF="027004_0106_0FD2DDEE7AAA99B8">lent him the nece&s;&s;ary &s;um to buy out his time of Keimer, came one day to offer him&s;elf to us as a journeyman. We could not employ him immediately; but I fooli&s;hly told him, under the ro&s;e, that I intended &s;hortly to pub|li&s;h a new periodical paper, and that we &s;hould then have work for him. My hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s, which I imparted to him, were founded on the circum&s;tance, that the only paper we had in Philadelphia at that time, and which Bradford printed, was a paltry thing, mi&s;e|rably conducted, in no re&s;pect amu&s;ing, and yet was profitable. I con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;ed that a good work of this kind could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s. Webb betrayed my &s;ecret to Kei|mer, who, to prevent me, immediately pub|li&s;hed the <HI>pro&s;pectus</HI> of a paper that he intend|ed to in&s;titute him&s;elf, and in which Webb was to be engaged.</P>
<P>I was exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perated at this proceeding and, with a view to counteract them, not being able at pre&s;ent to in&s;titute my own paper, I wrote &s;ome humourous pieces in Bradford's, under the title of the Bu&s;y Body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A manu&s;cript note in the file of the America Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;erved in the Philadelphia Library, &s;ay tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n wrote the fir&s;t five numbers, and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the eighth.</NOTE>; and which was continued for &s;everal months by Breintnal. I hereby fixed the attention of the public upon Bradford's paper; and the <HI>pro&s;pectus</HI> of Kei|mer, which he turned into ridicule, was trea|ted with contempt. He began, notwith&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="107" REF="027004_0107_0FD2DE5DCD262278">his paper; and after continuing it for nine months, having at mo&s;t not more than ninety &s;ub&s;cribers, he offered it me for a mere trifle. I had for &s;ome time been ready for &s;uch an engagement; I therefore in&s;tantly took it upon my&s;elf, and in a few years it proved extremely profitable to me.</P>
<P>I perceive that I am apt to &s;peak in the fir&s;t per&s;on, though our partner&s;hip &s;till continued. It is perhaps, becau&s;e in fact, the whole bu|&s;ine&s;s devolved upon me. Meredith was no compo&s;itor, and but an indifferent pre&s;&s;man; and it was rarely that he ab&s;tained from hard drinking. My friends were &s;orry to &s;ee me connected with him; but I contrived to de|rive from it the utmo&s;t advantage the ca&s;e ad|mitted.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t number produced no other affect than any other paper which had appeared in the province, as to type and printing; but &s;ome remarks, in my peculiar &s;tyle of writ|ing, upon the di&s;pute which then prevailed between governor Burnet, and the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts a&s;&s;embly, &s;truck &s;ome per&s;ons as above mediocrity, cau&s;ed the paper and its editors to be talked of, and in a few weeks induced them to become our &s;ub&s;cribers. Many others followed their example; and our &s;ub&s;cription continued to increa&s;e. This was one of the fir&s;t good effects of the pains I had taken to learn to put my ideas on paper. I derived this farther advantage f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om it, that the leading men of the place, &s;eeing in the author of
<PB N="108" REF="027004_0108_0FD2DE06B897AFA8">this pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> well able to u&s;e his pen, thought it right to encourage and pat|roni&s;e me.</P>
<P>The votes, laws, and other public pieces, were printed by Bradford. An addre&s;s of the hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly to the govenor had been executed by him in a very coar&s;e and incor|rect manner. We reprinted it with accura|cy and neatne&s;s, and &s;ent a copy to every mem|ber. They perceived the difference; and it &s;o &s;trengthened the influence of our friends in the A&s;&s;embly, that we were nominated its printer for the following year.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e friends I ought not to forget one member in particular, Mr. Hamilton, whom I have mentioned in a former part of my narrative, and who was now returned from England. He warmly intere&s;ted him&s;elf for me on this occa&s;ion, as he did likewi&s;e on ma|ny others afterwards; having continued his kindne&s;s to me till his death.</P>
<P>About this period Mr. Vernon reminded me of the debt I owed him, but without pre&s;&s;|ing me for payment. I wrote him a hand&s;ome letter on the occa&s;ion, begging him to wait a little longer, to which he con&s;ented; and as &s;oon as I was able I paid him, principal and intere&s;t, with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude; &s;o that this error of my life was in a manner atoned for.</P>
<P>But another trouble now happened to me, which I had not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to expect. Meredith's father, who, according to our
<PB N="109" REF="027004_0109_0FD2DE5F34D89850">agreement, was to defray the whole expence of our printing materials, had only paid a hun|dred pounds. Another hundred was &s;till due, and the merchant being tired of waiting, com|menced a &s;uit again&s;t us. We bailed the ac|tion, with the melancholy pro&s;pect, that, if the money was not forth coming at the time fixed, the affair would come to i&s;&s;ue, judg|ment be put in execution, our delightful hopes be annihilated, and our&s;elves entirely ruined; as the type and pre&s;s mu&s;t be &s;old, perhaps at half their value, to pay the debt.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, two real friends, who&s;e gen|erous conduct I have never forgotten, and nev|er &s;hall forget while I retain the remembrance of any thing, came to me &s;eparately, without the knowledge of each other, and without my having applied to them. Each offered me whatever &s;um might be nece&s;&s;ary, to take the bu&s;ine&s;s into my own hands, if the thing was practicable, as they did not like I &s;hould con|tinue in partner&s;hip with Meredith, who, they &s;aid, was frequently &s;een drunk in the &s;treets, and gambling at ale-hou&s;es, which very much injured our credit. The&s;e friends were Wil|liam Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them that while there remained any probability that the Merediths would fulfil their part of the compact, I could not propo&s;e a &s;eperation; as I conceived my&s;elf to be under obligations to them for what they had done already, and were &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to do if they had the pow|er:
<PB N="110" REF="027004_0110_0FD2DE0832107F70">but in the end &s;hould they fail in their engagement, and our partner&s;hip be di&s;&s;olved, I &s;hould then think my&s;elf at liberty to accept the kindne&s;s of my friends.</P>
<P>Things remained for &s;ome time in this &s;tate. At la&s;t I &s;aid one day to my partner, "Your father is perhaps di&s;&s;atisfied with your having a &s;hare only in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and is unwilling to do for two, what he would do for you alone. Tell me frankly if that be the ca&s;e, and I will re&s;ign the whole to you, and do for my&s;elf as well as I can."&mdash;" No (&s;aid he) my father has really been di&s;appointed in his hopes; he is not able to pay, and I wi&s;h to put him to no further inconvenience. I &s;ee that I am not at all calculated for a printer; I was educated as a farmer, and it was ab&s;urd in me to come here, at thirty years of age, and bind my&s;elf apprentice to a new trade. Many of my countrymen are going to &s;ettle in North-Carolina, where the &s;oil is exceeding|ly favourable. I am tempted to go with them, and to re&s;ume my former occupation. You will doubtle&s;s find friends who will a&s;&s;i&s;t you. If you will take upon your&s;elf the debts of the partner&s;hip, return my father the hun|dred pounds he has advanced, pay my little per&s;onal debts, and give me thirty pounds and a new &s;addle, I will renounce the part|ner&s;hip, and con&s;ign over the whole &s;tock to you."</P>
<P>I accepted this propo&s;al without he&s;itation. It was committed to paper, and &s;igned and
<PB N="111" REF="027004_0111_0FD2DEE5384136F0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealed without delay. I gave him what he demanded, and he departed &s;oon after for Carolina, from whence he &s;ent me, in the following year, two long letters, containing the be&s;t accounts that had yet been given of that country, as to climate, &s;oil, agriculture, &amp;c. for he was well ver&s;ed in the&s;e matters. I publi&s;hed them in my new&s;paper, and they were received with great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone I applied to my two friends, and not wi&s;hing to give a di&s;o|bliging preference to either of them, I ac|cepted from each half what he had offered me, and which it was nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould have. I paid the partner&s;hip debts, and continued the bu&s;ine&s;s on my own account; taking care to inform the public, by adverti&s;ement, of the partner&s;hip being di&s;&s;olved. This was, I think, in the year 1729, or thereabout.</P>
<P>Nearly at the &s;ame period the people de|manded a new emi&s;&s;ion of paper money; the exi&s;ting and only one that had taken place in the province, and which amounted to fifteen thou&s;and pounds, being &s;oon to expire. The wealthy inhabitants, prejudiced again&s;t every &s;ort of paper currency, from the fear of its depreciation, of which there had been an in|&s;tance in the province of New-England, to the injury of its holders, &s;trongly oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure. We had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this affair in our junto, in which I was on the &s;ide of the new emi&s;&s;ion; convinced that the fir&s;t &s;mall &s;um fabricated in 1723, had done much
<PB N="112" REF="027004_0112_0FD2DE0936581C00">good in the province, by favouring commerce, indu&s;try and population, &s;ince all the hou&s;es were now inhabited, and many others build|ing; whereas I remembered to have &s;een, when fir&s;t I paraded the &s;treets of Philadel|phia eating my roll, the majority of tho&s;e in Walnut-&s;treet, Second-&s;treet, Fourth-&s;treet, as well as a great number in Che&s;nut and other &s;treets, with papers on them &s;ignifying that they were to be let; which made me think at the time that the inhabitants of the town were de&s;erting it one after another.</P>
<P>Our debates made me &s;o fully ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject, that I wrote and publi&s;hed an anony|mous pamphlet, entitled, An Enquiry into the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of a Paper Curren|cy. It was very well received by the lower and middling cla&s;s of people; but it di&s;|plea&s;ed the opulent, as it increa&s;ed the cla|mour in favour of the new emi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Hav|ing, however, no writer among them capable of an&s;wering it, their oppo&s;ition became le&s;s violent; an there being in the hou&s;e of A&s;|&s;embly a majority for the mea&s;ure, it pa&s;&s;ed. The friends I had acquired in the hou&s;e, per|&s;uaded that I had done the country e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice on this occa&s;ion, rewarded me by giving me the printing of the bills. It was a lucrative employment, and proved a very &s;ea&s;onable help to me; another advantage which I derived from having habituated my|&s;elf to write.</P>
<P>Time and experience &s;o fully demon&s;trated
<PB N="113" REF="027004_0113_0FD2DE644C1CE038">the utility of paper currency, that it never after experienced any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition; &s;o that it &s;oon amounted to 55,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and in the year 1739 to 80,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> It has &s;ince ri&s;en, during the la&s;t war, to 350,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> trade, buildings and population having in the inter|val continually encrea&s;ed, but I am now con|vinced that there are limits beyond which paper money would be prejudicial.</P>
<P>I &s;oon after obtained, by the influence of my friend Hamilton, the printing of the Newca&s;tle paper money, another profitable work, as I then thought it, little things ap|pearing great to per&s;ons of moderate fortune; and they were really great to me, as proving great encouragements. He al&s;o procured me the printing of the laws and votes of that government which I retained as long as I con|tinued in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I now opened a &s;mall &s;tationer's &s;hop. I kept bonds and agreements of all kinds, drawn up in a more accurate form than had yet been &s;een in that part of the world; a work in which I was assi&s;ted by my friend Brientnal. I had al&s;o paper, parchment, pa&s;teboard, books, &amp;c. One Whitema&s;h, an excellent compo&s;itor, whom I had known in London, came to offer him&s;elf. I engaged him, and he continued con&s;tantly and dili|gently to work with me, I al&s;o took an ap|prentice, the &s;on of Aqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a Ro&s;e.</P>
<P>I began to pay, by degrees, the debt I had contracted; and in order to injure my credit
<PB N="114" REF="027004_0114_0FD2DE0AC128B8F0">and character as a trade&s;man. I took care not only to be <HI>really</HI> indu&s;trious and frugal, but al&s;o to avoid every appearance of the contra|ry. I was plainly dre&s;&s;ed, and never &s;een in any place of public amu&s;ement. I never went a fi&s;hing or hunting: A book indeed enticed me &s;ometimes from my work, but it was &s;el|dom, by &s;tealth, and occa&s;ioned no &s;candal; and to &s;how that I did not think my&s;elf above my profe&s;&s;ion, I conveyed home &s;ometimes in a wheelbarrow the paper I purcha&s;ed at the warehou&s;es.</P>
<P>I thus obtained the reputation of being an indu&s;trious young man, and very punctual in my payments. The merchants who imported articles of &s;tationary &s;olicited my cu&s;tom; others offered to furni&s;h me with books, and my little trade went on pro&s;perou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the credit and bu&s;ine&s;s of Keim|er dimini&s;hed every day, he was at la&s;t for|ced to &s;ell his &s;tock to &s;atisfy his creditors; and he betook him&s;elf to Barbadoes, where he lived &s;ome time in a very impoveri&s;hed &s;tate. His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had in&s;tructed while I worked with Keimer, having bought his materials, &s;ucceeded him in the bu&s;ine&s;s. I was apprehen&s;ive at fir&s;t of finding in Harry a powerful competitor, as he was allied to an opulent and re&s;pectable family; I therefore propo&s;ed a partner&s;hip, which, happily for me, he rejected with di&s;|dain. He was extremely proud, thought him&s;elf a fine gentleman, lived extravagant|ly, and pur&s;ued amu&s;ements which &s;uffered
<PB N="115" REF="027004_0115_0FD2DE6697CD4300">him to be &s;carcely ever at home; of con&s;e|quence he became in debt, neglected his bu|&s;ine&s;s, and bu&s;ine&s;s neglected him. Finding in a &s;hort time nothing to be done in the coun|try, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, car|rying his printing materials with him. There the apprentice employed his old ma&s;ter as a journeyman. They were continually quarrel|ling; and Harry &s;till getting in debt, was oblig|ed at la&s;t to &s;ell his pre&s;s and types, and return to his old occupation of hu&s;bandry in Penn&s;ylvania. The per&s;on who purcha&s;ed them employed Keimer to manage the bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but he died a few years after.</P>
<P>I had now at Philadelphia no competitor but Brandford, who, being in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, did not engage in the printing of books, except now and then as workmen chanced to offer them&s;elves; and was not anxious to ex|tend his trade. He had, however, one ad|vantage over me, as he had the direction of the po&s;t-office, and was of con&s;equence &s;up|po&s;ed to have better opportunities of obtain|ing news. His paper was al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be more advantageous to adverti&s;ing cu&s;tomers; an din con&s;equence of that &s;uppo&s;ition, his ad|verti&s;ements where much more numerous than mine: this was a &s;ource of great profit to him, and di&s;advantageous to me. It was to no pur|po&s;e that I really procured other papers, and di&s;tributed my own, by means of the po&s;t; the public took for granted my inability in this re&s;pect; and I was indeed unable to con|quer
<PB N="116" REF="027004_0116_0FD2DE0C34088E80">it in any other mode than by bribing the po&s;t-boys who &s;erved me only by &s;tealth, Brad|ford being &s;o illiberal as to forbid them.&mdash; This treatment of his excited by re&s;entment; and my di&s;gu&s;t was &s;o rooted, that, when I afterwards &s;ucceeded him in the po&s;t-office, I took care to avoid copying his example.</P>
<P>I had hitherto continued to board with God|frey, who, with his wife and children, occu|pied part of my hou&s;e, and half of the &s;hop for his bu&s;ine&s;s; at which indeed he worked very little, being always ab&s;orbed by mathe|matics. Mrs. Godfrey formed a wi&s;h of Mar|rying me to the daughter of one of her rela|tions. She contrived various opportunities of bringing us together, till &s;he &s;aw that I was captivated; which was not difficult, they lady in que&s;tion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great per&s;onal merit. The parents encouraged my addre&s;&s;es, by in|viting me continually to &s;upper and leaving us together, till at la&s;t it was time to come to an explanation. Mrs. Godfrey undertook to ne|gociate our little treaty. I gave her to under|&s;tand, that I expected to receive with the young lady a &s;um of money that would enable me at lea&s;t to di&s;charge the remainder of my debt for my printing materials. It was then, I be|lieve, not more than a hundred pounds. She brought me for an&s;wer, that they had no &s;uch &s;um at their di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;al. I ob&s;erved that it might ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily be obtained, by a mortgage on their hou&s;e. The reply of this was, after a few days interval, that they did not approve of the match; that they had con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted Bradford,
<PB N="117" REF="027004_0117_0FD2DE67DE8DDA88"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d found that the bu&s;ine&s;s of a printer was not lucrative; that my letters would &s;oon be worn out, and mu&s;t be &s;upplied by new ones; that Keimer and Harry had failed, and that, probably, I &s;hould do &s;o too. Accordingly the forbade me the hou&s;e, and the young lady was confined. I know not if they had really changed their minds, or if it was mere|ly an artifice, &s;uppo&s;ing our affections to be too far engaged for us to de&s;i&s;t, and that we &s;hould contrive to marry &s;ecretly, which would leave them at liberty to give or not as they plea&s;ed. But, &s;u&s;pecting this motive, I never went again to their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Some time after Mrs. Godfrey informed me that they were favourably di&s;po&s;ed towards me, and wi&s;hed me to renew the acquaintance; but I declared a firm re&s;olution never to have any thing more to do with the family. The Godfreys expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome re&s;entment at this; and as we could no longer agree, they chang|ed their re&s;idence, leaving me in po&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole hou&s;e. I then re&s;olved to take no more lodgers. This affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I looked around me, and made overtures of alliance in other quar|ters; but I &s;oon found that the profe&s;&s;ion of a printer being generally looked upon as a poor trade, I could expect no money with a wife, at lea&s;t if I wi&s;hed her to po&s;&s;e&s;s any other charm. Meanwhile, that pa&s;&s;ion of youth, &s;o difficult to govern, had often drawn me into intrigues with de&s;picable women who
<PB N="118" REF="027004_0118_0FD2DE0DC00FBB58">fell in my way; which were not unaccompa|nied with expence and inconvenience, be&s;ides the perpetual ri&s;k of injuring my health, and catching a di&s;ea&s;e which I dreaded above all things. But I was fotunate enough to e&s;cape this danger.</P>
<P>As a neighbour and old acquaintance, I kept up a friendly intimacy with the family of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Read. Her parents retained an affection for me from the time of my lodging in their hou&s;e. I was often invited thither; con&s;ulted me about their affairs, and I had been &s;ometimes &s;ervice|able to them. I was touched with the unhap|py &s;ituation of their daughter, who was almo&s;t always melancholy, and continually &s;eeking &s;olitude. I regarded my forgetfulne&s;s and incon&s;tancy, during my abode in London, as the principal cau&s;e of her misfortune; though her mother had the candour to attribute the fault to her&s;elf, rather than to me, becau&s;e, after having prevented our marriage previous to my departure, &s;he had induced her to mar|ry another in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Our mutual affection revived; but there ex|i&s;ted great ob&s;tacles to our union. Her marriage was con&s;idered, indeed, as not being valid, the man having, it was &s;aid, a former wife &s;till living in England; but of this it was dif|ficult to obtain a proof at &s;o great a di&s;tance; and though a report prevailed of his being dead, yet we had no certainty of it; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true, he had left many debts, for the payment of which his &s;ucce&s;&s;or might be &s;ued. We ven|tured

We pro&s;pered together, and it was our mutual &s;tudy to render each other happy. Thus I corrected, as well as I could, this great error of my youth.</P>
<P>Our club was not at that time e&s;tabli&s;hed at a tavern. We held our meetings at the hou&s;e of Mr. Grace, who appropriated a room to the purpo&s;e. Some member ob&s;erved one day, that as our books were frequently quo|ted in the cour&s;e of our di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, it would be convenient to have them collected in the room in which we a&s;&s;embled, in order to be con&s;ulted upon occa&s;ion; and that, by thus forming a common library of our individual collections, each would have the advantage of u&s;ing the books of all the other members, which would nearly be the &s;ame as if he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them all him&s;elf. The idea was approv|ed, and we accordingly brought &s;uch books as we thought we could &s;pare, which were placed at the end of the club-room. They amounted not to &s;o many as we expected; and though we made con&s;iderable u&s;e of them, yet &s;ome incon|veniencies re&s;ulting, from want of care, it was agreed, after about a year, to de&s;troy the col|lection; and each took away &s;uch books as belonged to him.</P>

<PB N="126" REF="027004_0126_0FD2DE3E94F8BA88">for in&s;uring hou&s;es from fire, which was adop|ted; and the a&s;&s;ociation continues to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day. The advantages experienced from it have been great.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Penn&s;ylva|nia, a &s;pirit of di&s;pute appears to have pre|vailed among&s;t its inhabitants. During the life-time of William Penn, the con&s;titution had been three times altered. After this pe|riod, the hi&s;tory of Penn&s;ylvania is little el&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than a recital of the quarrels between the pro|prietaries, or their governors and the A&s;&s;em|bly. The proprietaries contended for the right of exempting their land from taxes; to which the A&s;&s;embly would by no means con|&s;ent. This &s;ubject of di&s;pute interfered in almo&s;t every que&s;tion, and prevented the mo&s;t &s;alutary laws from being enacted. This at times &s;ubjected the people to great incon|veniencies. In the year 1744, during a war between France and Great Britain, &s;ome French and Indians had made inroads upon the frontier inhabitants of the province, who were unprovided for &s;uch an attack. It be|came nece&s;&s;ary that the citizens &s;hould arm for their defence. Governor Thomas recom|mended to the A&s;&s;embly, who were then &s;it|ting, to pa&s;s a militia law. To this they would agree only upon condition that he &s;hould give his a&s;&s;ent to certain laws, which appeared to them calculated to promote the intere&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the people. As he thought the&s;e laws would be injurious to the proprietaries, he refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to them; and the A&s;&s;embly broke
<PB N="127" REF="027004_0127_0FD2DE75F933BCE0">up without pa&s;&s;ing a militia law. The &s;itua|tion of the province was at this time truly alarming: expo&s;ed to the continual inroads of an enemy, and de&s;titute of every means of defence. At this cri&s;is Franklin &s;tepped forth and propo&s;ed to a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia, a plan of a voluntary a&s;&s;ociati|on for the defence of the province. This was approved of, and &s;igned by twelve hun|dred per&s;ons immediately. Copies of it were circulated throughout the province; and in a &s;hort time the number of &s;igners amounted to ten thou&s;and. Franklin was cho&s;en colo|nel of the Philadelphia regiment; but he did not think proper to accept of the honour.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uits of a different nature now occupied the greate&s;t part of his attention for &s;ome years. He engaged in a cour&s;e of electrical experi|ments, with all the ardor and thir&s;t for di&s;cov|ery which characterized the philo&s;ophers of that day. Of all the branches of experimen|tal philo&s;ophy, electricity had been lea&s;t ex|plored. The attractive power of amber is mentioned by Theophra&s;tus and Pliny, and, from them, by later naturali&s;ts. In the year 1600, Gilbert, an Engli&s;h phy&s;ician, enlarg|ed con&s;iderably the catalogue of &s;ub&s;tances which have the property of attracting light bodies. Boyle, Otto Guericke, a burgoma&s;t|er of Magdeburg, celebrated as the inventor of the air pump, Dr. Wall, and Sir I&s;aac Newton added &s;ome facts. Guericke fir&s;t ob|&s;erved the repul&s;ive power of electricity, and

For &s;everal years electricity was entirely neglected, until Mr. Gray applied him&s;elf to it, in 1728, with great a&s;&s;iduity. He, and his friend Mr. Wheeler, made a great variety of experiments&punc; in which they demon&s;trated, that electricity may be communicated from one body to anoth|er, even without being in contact. and in this way may be conducted to a great di&s;tance Mr. Gray afterwards found, that, by &s;u&s;pend|ing rods of iron by &s;ilk or hair lines, and bringing an excited tube under them, &s;parks might be drawn, and a light perceived at the extremities in the dark. M. Du Faye, inten|dant of the French king's gardens, made a number of experiments, which added not a little to the &s;cience. He made the di&s;covery of two kinds of electricity, which he called <HI>vitreous</HI> and <HI>re&s;inous;</HI> the former produced by rubbing gla&s;s, the latter from excited &s;ulphur, &s;ealing-wax, &amp;c. But this idea he afterwards gave up as erroneous. Between the years 1739 and 1742, De&s;aguliers made a number of experiments, but added little of importance. He fir&s;t u&s;ed the terms <HI>conductors</HI> and <HI>electrics, per&s;e.</HI> In 1742, &s;everal ingenious Germans engaged in this &s;ubject. Of the&s;e the princi|pal were, profe&s;&s;or Boze of Wittemberg, pro|fe&s;&s;or Winkler of Leip&s;ic, Gordon, a Scotch Benedictine monk, profe&s;&s;or of philo&s;ophy at Erfurt, and Dr. Ludolf of Berlin. The re|&s;ult
<PB N="129" REF="027004_0129_0FD2DE7980981D68">of their re&s;earches a&s;toni&s;hed the philo&s;o|phers of Europe. Their apparatus was large, and by means of it they were enabled to col|lect large quantities of electricity, and thus to produce phenomena which had been hitherto unob&s;erved. They killed &s;mall birds, and &s;et &s;pirits on fire. Their experiments excited the curio&s;ity of other philo&s;ophers. Collin&s;on, about the year 1745, &s;ent to the library com|pany of Philadelphia an account of the&s;e ex|periments, together with a tube, and direct|ions how to u&s;e it. Franklin, with &s;ome of his friends, immediately engaged in a cour&s;e of experiments; the re&s;ult of which is well known. He was enabled to make a number of important di&s;coveries, and to propo&s;e the|ories to account for various phenomena; which have been univer&s;ally adopted, and which bid fair to endure for ages. His ob&s;er|vations he communicated, in a &s;eries of let|ters, to his friend Collin&s;on; the fir&s;t of which is dated March 28, 1747. In the&s;e he makes known the power of points in drawing and throwing off the electrical matter, which had hitherto e&s;caped the notice of electricians. He al&s;o made the grand di&s;covery of a <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus,</HI> or of a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> and <HI>negative</HI> &s;tate of electricity. We give him the honour of this, without he&s;itation; although the Engli&s;h have claimed it for their countryman Dr. Wat|&s;on. Wat&s;on's paper is dated January 21, 1748; Franklin's July 11, 1747 &s;everal months prior. Shortly after, Franklin, from
<PB N="130" REF="027004_0130_0FD2DE419E3C0550">his principles of plus and minus &s;tate, ex|plained, in a &s;atisfactory manner, the phe|nomena of the Leyden phial, fir&s;t ob&s;erved by profe&s;&s;or Mu&s;chenbroeck of Leyden, which had much perplexed philo&s;ophers. He &s;hew|ed clearly that the bottle, when charged, con|tained no more electricity than before, but that as much was taken from the one &s;ide as was thrown on the other; and that, to di&s;|charg it, nothing was nece&s;&s;ary but to make a communication between the two &s;ides, by which the equilibrium might be re&s;tored, and that then no &s;igns of electricity would remain. He afterwards demon&s;trated, by experiments, that the electricity did not re&s;ide in the coat|ing, as had been &s;uppo&s;ed, but in the pore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the gla&s;s it&s;elf. After a phial was charg|ed, he removed the coating, and found that upon applying a new coating the &s;hock might &s;till be received. In the year 1749, he fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted his idea of explaining the phenom|ena of thunder-gu&s;ts, and of the aurora bor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alis, upon electrical principles. He points out many particulars in which lightning and electricity agree; and he adduces many facts, and rea&s;oning from facts, in &s;upport of his po&s;itions. In the &s;ame year he conceived the a&s;toni&s;hingly bold and grand idea of a&s;cer|taining the truth of his doctrine, by actually drawing down the forked lightning, by means of &s;harp-pointed iron rods rai&s;ed into the re|gion of the clouds. Even in this uncertain &s;tate, his pa&s;&s;ion to be u&s;eful to mankind di&s;|plays
<PB N="131" REF="027004_0131_0FD2DE7A75EC17A8">it&s;elf in a powerful manner. Admitting the identity of electricity and lightning, and knowing the power of points in repelling bo|dies charged with electricity, and in conduct|ing their fire &s;ilently and imperceptibly, he &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of &s;ecuring hou&s;es, &s;hips, &amp;c. from being damaged by lightning, by erect|ing the pointed iron rods, which &s;hould ri&s;e &s;ome feet above the mo&s;t elevated part, and de&s;cend &s;ome feet into the ground or the water. The effect of the&s;e, he concluded, would be either to prevent a &s;troke by repel|ling the cloud beyond the &s;triking di&s;tance, or by drawing off the electrical fire which it con|tained; or, if they could not effect this, they would at lea&s;t conduct the &s;troke to the earth, without any injury to the building.</P>
<P>It was not until the &s;ummer of 1752, that he was enabled to complete his grand and un|parralleled di&s;covery by experiment. The plan which he had origionally propo&s;ed, was to erect on &s;ome high tower, or other elevated place, a centry box, from which &s;hould ri&s;e a pointed iron rod, in&s;ulated by being fixed in a cake of re&s;in. Electrified clouds pa&s;&s;ing over this, would, he conceived, impart to it a portion of their electricity, which would be rendered evident to the &s;en&s;es by &s;parks being emitted, when a key, a knuckle or other con|ductor, was pre&s;ented to it. Philadelphia at this time afforded no opportunity of trying an experiment of this kind. Whil&s;t Franklin was waiting for the erection of a &s;pire, it
<PB N="132" REF="027004_0132_0FD2DE4755BB9D28">occurred to him, that he might have more ready acce&s;s to the region of clouds by means of a common kite. He prepared one by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|taching two cro&s;s &s;ticks to a &s;ilk handkerchief, which would not &s;uffer &s;o much from the rain as paper. To his upright &s;tick was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|fixed an iron point. The &s;tring was, as u&s;ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, of hemp, excepting the lower end which was &s;ilk. Where the hempen &s;tring terminated, a key was fa&s;tened. With this apparatus, on the appearance of a thunder-gu&s;t approaching he went out into the commons, accompanied by his &s;on, to whom alone he communicated his intentions, well knowing the ridicule which, too generally for the intere&s;t of &s;ci|ence, waits un&s;ucce&s;sful experiments in phi|lo&s;ophy. He placed him&s;elf under a &s;hed to avoid the rain. His kite was rai&s;ed. A thun|der-cloud pa&s;&s;ed over it. No &s;ign of electri|city appeared. He almo&s;t de&s;paired of &s;uc|ce&s;s; when &s;uddenly he ob&s;erved the loo&s;e fibres of his &s;tring to move towards an erect po&s;ition. He now pre&s;ented his knuckle to the key, and received a &s;trong &s;park. How exqui&s;ite mu&s;t his &s;en&s;ations have been at this moment! On this experiment depended the fate of his theory. If he &s;ucceeded, his name would rank high among tho&s;e who have im|proved &s;cience; if he failed, he mu&s;t be ine|vitably &s;ubjected to the deri&s;ion of mankind, or, what is wor&s;e, their pity, as a well-mean|ing man, but a weak &s;illy projector. The anxiety with which he looked for the re&s;ult
<PB N="133" REF="027004_0133_0FD2DE7FB9CA5B78">this experiment, may ea&s;ily be conceived. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oubts and de&s;pair had begun to prevail, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen the fact was a&s;certained in &s;o clear a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anner, that even the mo&s;t incredulous could a longer withhold their a&s;&s;ent.

<P>About a month before this period, &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">genious Frenchmen had completed the di&s;covery, in the manner originally propo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Dr. Franklin.

A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry incorrect French tran&s;lation fell into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nds of the celebrated Buffon, who, notwith|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">anding the di&s;advantages under which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ork laboured, was much plea&s;ed with it, and repeated the experiments with &s;ucce&s;s. He prevailed upon his friend, M. D' Alibard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give his countrymen a more correct tran&s;lati|on of the work of the American electrician. This contributed towards &s;preading a know|ledge of Franklin's priciples in France. The King, Louis XV. hearing of the&s;e experiments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to be a &s;pectator of them.
<PB N="134" REF="027004_0134_0FD2DE491D4ECAD8">A cour&s;e of experiments was given at the &s;eat of the Duc D' Ayen, at St. Germain by M. De Lor. The applau&s;es which the King be&s;towed upon Franklin, excited in Buf|fon, D' Alibard, and De Lor, an earne&s;t de&s;ire of a&s;certaining the truth of his theory of thun|der-gu&s;ts. Buffon erected his apparatus on the tower of Montbar, M. D' Alibard at Ma|ry-la-ville, and De Lor at his hou&s;e in the <HI>E&s;trapade</HI> at Paris, &s;ome of the highe&s;t ground in that capital. D' Alibard's machine fir&s;t &s;hewed &s;igns of electricity. On the 10th of May, 1752, a thunder-cloud pa&s;&s;ed over it, in the ab&s;ence of M. D' Alibard; and a num|ber of &s;parks were drawn from it by Coiffier, a joiner, with whom D' Alibard had left direc|tions how to proceed, and by M. Roulet, the prior of Mary la-ville. An account of this ex|periment given to the Royal Academy of Sci|ences, in a memoir by M. D' Alibard, dated May 13th, 1752. On the 18 of May, M. De Lor proved equally &s;ucce&s;sful with the appa|ratus erected at his own hou&s;e. The&s;e di&s;co|veries &s;oon excited the philo&s;ophers of other parts of Europe to repeat the experiment. Among&s;t the&s;e, none &s;ignalized them&s;elves more than Father Beccaria of Turin, to who&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;cience is much indebted. Even the cold regions of Ru&s;&s;ia were penetrated by the ardor for di&s;covery.

<PB N="135" REF="027004_0135_0FD2DE82F7C56B88">The friends of &s;cience will long remember with regret the amiable martyr to electricity.</P>
<P>By the&s;e experiments Franklin's theory was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mo&s;t firm manner. When the thruth of it could no longer be doubted, the vanity of men endeavoured to de|tract from its merit. That an American, an in|habitant of the ob&s;curecity of Philadelphia, the name of which was hardly known, &s;hould be able to make di&s;coveries, and to frame theo|ries, which had e&s;caped the notice of the en|lightened philo&s;ophers of Europe was too mortifying to be admitted. He mu&s;t certain|ly have taken the idea from &s;ombody el&s;e. An American, a being of an inferior order, make di&s;coveries! Impo&s;&s;ible. It was &s;aid, that the Abbe Nollet, in 1748, had &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the &s;imilarity of lightning and electricity, in his <HI>Legons de Phy&s;ique.</HI> It is true, that the Abbe mentions the idea, but he throws it out as a bare conjecture, and propo&s;es no mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">certaining the truth of it. He him&s;elf acknow|ledges, that Franklin fir&s;t entertained the bold thought of bringing lightning from the hea|vens, by means of pointed rods fixed in the air. The &s;imilarity of electricity and light|ning is &s;o &s;trong, that we need not be &s;urpri|&s;ed at notice being taken of it, as &s;oon as elec|trical phenomina became familiar. We find it mentioned by Dr. Wall and Mr. Grey, while the &s;cience was in its infancy. But the honour of forming a regular theory of thun|der-gu&s;ts, of &s;ugge&s;ting a mode of deter|mining
<PB N="136" REF="027004_0136_0FD2DE4A7B1B5CE8">the truth of it by experiments, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> putting the&s;e experiments in practice, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thus e&s;tabli&s;hing his theory upon a firm a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;olid ba&s;is, is inconte&s;tibly due to Franklin. D' Alibard, who made the experiments in France, &s;ays, that he only followed the track which Franklin had pointed out.</P>
<P>It has been of late a&s;&s;erted, that the honor of completing the experiment with the electri|cal kite, does not belong to Franklin. Some late Engli&s;h paragraphs attributed it to &s;ome Frenchman, who&s;e name they do not mention; and the Abbe Bertholon gives it to M. De Romas, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the pre&s;ideal of Nerac; the Engli&s;h paragraphs probably refer to the &s;ame per&s;on. But a very &s;light attention will con|vince us of the inju&s;tice of this procedure: Dr. Franklin's experiment was made in June 1752; and his letter, giving an account of it, is dated October 19, 1752, M. De Romas made his fir&s;t attempt on the 14th of May 1753, but was not &s;ucce&s;sful until the 7th of June; a year after Franklin had completed the di&s;covery, and when it was known to all the philo&s;ophers in Europe.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e great principles, Franklin's letters on electricity contain a number of facts and hints, which have contributed great|ly towards reducing this branch of knowlege to a &s;cience. His friend, Mr. Kinner&s;ly, com|municated to him a di&s;covery of the different kinds of electricity executed by rubbing gla&s;s and &s;ulphur.

Franklin at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir&s;t entertained the &s;ame idea; but upon re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eating the experiments, he perceived that Mr. Kinner&s;ley was right; and that the <HI>vitre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> and <HI>re&s;mous</HI> electricity of Du Faye were no|thing more than the <HI>po&s;itive</HI> and <HI>negative</HI> &s;tates which he had before ob&s;erved; that the gla&s;s globe charged <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> or increa&s;ed the quantity of electricity on the prime conductor, whil&s;t the globe of &s;ulphur dimini&s;hes its natu|ral quantity, or charged <HI>negatively.</HI> The&s;e expe|riments and ob&s;ervations opened a new field for inve&s;tigation, upon which electricians en|tered with avidity; and their labours have added much to the &s;tock of our knowledge.</P>
<P>In September, 1752, Franklin entered up|on a cour&s;e of experiments, to determine the &s;tate of electricity in the clouds. From a num|ber of experiments he formed this conclu&s;ion: "that the clouds of a thunder-gu&s;t are mo&s;t commonly in a negative &s;tate of electricity, but &s;ometimes in a po&s;itive &s;tate;" and from this it follows, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, "that, for the mo&s;t part, in thunder-&s;trokes, it is the earth that &s;trikes into the clouds, and not the clouds that &s;trike into the earth." The letter containing the&s;e ob&s;ervations, is dated in September, 1753; and yet the di&s;covery of a&s;cending thunder has been &s;aid to be of a
<PB N="138" REF="027004_0138_0FD2DE4C0C0E22C8">modern date, and has been attributed to the Abbe Bertholon, who publi&s;hed his memoirs on the &s;ubject in 1776.</P>
<P>Franklin's letters have been tran&s;lated into mo&s;t of the European languages, and into Latin. In proportion as they have become known, his principles have been adopted. Some oppo&s;ition was made to his theories, particularly by the Abbe Nollet, who was, however, but feebly &s;upported, whil&s;t the fir&s;t philo&s;ophers of Europe &s;tepped forth in defence of Franklin's principles; among&s;t whom D' Alibard and Beccaria were the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. The oppo&s;ition has gradually cea&s;|ed, and the Franklinian &s;y&s;tem is now uni|ver&s;ally adopted, where &s;cience flouri&s;hes.</P>
<P>The important practical u&s;e which Franklin made of his di&s;coveries, the &s;ecuring of hou&s;|es from injury by lightning, has been already mentioned. Pointed conductors are now ve|ry common in America; but prejudice has hitherto prevented their general introduction into Europe, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t un|doubted proofs of their utility have been giv|en. But mankind can with difficulty be brought to lay a&s;ide e&s;tabli&s;hed practices, or to adopt new ones. And perhaps we have more rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed that a practice, however rational, which was propo&s;ed about forty years ago, &s;hould in that time have been adopted in &s;o many places, than that it has not univer&s;ally prevailed. It is only by de|grees that the great body of mankind can be led into knew practices, however &s;alutary their
<PB N="139" REF="027004_0139_0FD2DE85E130CF98">tendency. It is now nearly eighty years &s;ince inoculation was introduced into Europe and America; and it is &s;o far from being general at pre&s;ent, that it will, perhaps, require one or two centuries to render it &s;o.</P>
<P>In the year 1745, Franklin publi&s;hed an account of his new invented Penn&s;ylvania fire-place, in which he minutely and accurate|ly &s;tates the advantages and di&s;advantages of different kinds of fire-places; and endeavours to &s;hew that the one which he de&s;cribes is to be preferred to any other. This contrivance has given ri&s;e to the open &s;toves now in gen|eral u&s;e, which however differ from it in con|&s;truction, particularly in not having an air|box at the back, through which a con&s;tant &s;upply of air, warmed in its pa&s;&s;age, is thrown into the room. The advantages of this are, that as a &s;tream of warm air is continually flowing into the room, le&s;s fuel is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a proper temperature, and the room may be &s;o tightened as that no air may enter through cracks; the con&s;equences of which are colds, toothaches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Although philo&s;ophy was a principal object of Franklin's pur&s;uit for &s;everal years, he con|fined him&s;elf not to this. In the year 1747, he became a member of the general a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, as a burge&s;s for the city of Philadelphia. Warm di&s;putes at this time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the a&s;&s;embly and the pro|prietaries; each contending for what they conceived to be their ju&s;t rights. Franklin,
<PB N="140" REF="027004_0140_0FD2DE4DABDBD050">a friend to the rights of man from his infancy, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a &s;teady oppon|ent of the unju&s;t &s;chemes of the proprietaries. He was &s;oon looked up to as the head of the oppo&s;ition; and to him have been attributed many of the &s;pirited replies of the a&s;&s;embly, to the me&s;&s;ages of the governors. His influ|ence in the body was very great. This aro&s;e not from any &s;uperior powers of eloquence; he &s;poke but &s;eldom, and he never was known to make any thing like an elaborate harangue. His &s;peeches often con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ingle &s;en|tence, or of a well told &s;tory, the moral of which was always obviou&s;ly to the point. He never attempted the flowery fields of oratory. His manner was plain and mild. His &s;tyle in &s;peaking was, like that of his writings, re|markably conci&s;e. With this plain manner, and his penetrating and &s;olid judgment, he was able to confound the mo&s;t eloquent and &s;ubtle of his adver&s;aries, to confirm the opin|ions of his friends, and to make converts of the unprejudiced, who had oppo&s;ed him. With a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, he has rendered of no avail, an elegant and lengthy di&s;cour&s;e, and determined the fate of a que&s;tion of im|portance.</P>
<P>But he was not contented with thus &s;up|porting the rights of the people. He wi&s;hed to render them permanently &s;ecure, which can only be done by making their value pro|perly known; and this mu&s;t depend upon in|crea&s;ing and extending information to every
<PB N="141" REF="027004_0141_0FD2DE87CE200B08">cla&s;s of men. We have already &s;een that he was the founder of the public library, which contributed greatly towards improving the minds of the citizens. But this was not &s;uf|ficient. The &s;chools then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting were in general of little utility. The teachers were men, ill qualified for the important duty which they had undertaken; and, after all, nothing more could be obtained than the rudiments of a common Engli&s;h education. Franklin drew up a plan of an academy, to be erected in the city of Philadelphia, &s;uited to "the &s;tate of an infant country;" but in this, as in all his plans, he confined not his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ews to the pre&s;ent time only. He looked forward to the period when an in&s;titution on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n enlarged plan would become nece&s;&s;ary. With this view he con&s;idered his academy as "a foundation for po&s;terity to erect a &s;emina|ry of learning, more exten&s;ive, and &s;uitable to future circum&s;tances." In pur&s;uance of this plan, the con&s;titutions were drawn up and &s;igned on the 13th of November 1749. in the&s;e, twenty-four of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens of Philadelphia were named as tru&s;|tees. In the choice of the&s;e, and in the for|mation of his plan, Franklin is &s;aid to have con&s;ulted chiefly with Thomas Hopkin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Rev. Richard Peters, then &s;ecretary of the province, Tench Francis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> attorney-general, and Dr. Phineas Bond.</P>

<P>"In ca&s;e of the inability of the <HI>rector,</HI> or any ma&s;ter, (e&s;tabli&s;hed on the foundation by receiving a certain &s;alary) through &s;ickne&s;s, or any other natural infirmity, whereby he may be reduced to poverty, the tru&s;tees &s;hall have power to contribute to his &s;upport, in proportion to his di&s;tre&s;s and merit, and the &s;tock in their hands."</P>

<P>"It is hoped and expected that the tru&s;tees will make it their plea&s;ure, and in &s;ome de|gree their bu&s;ine&s;s, to vi&s;it the academy often; to encourage and countenance the youth, countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;t the ma&s;ters, and by all means in their power advance the u&s;efulne&s;s and reputation of the de&s;ign; that they will look on the &s;tudents as, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, their own children, treat them with familiarity and affection; and when they have behaved well, gone through their &s;tudies, and are to enter the world, they &s;hall zealou&s;ly unite, and make all the intere&s;t that can be made, to promote and e&s;tabli&s;h them, whether in bu&s;ine&s;s, offices, marriages, or any other thing for their advantage, preferable to all other per&s;ons what&s;oever, even of equal merit."</P>

The con&s;titutions being &s;igned and made public, with the names of the gentlemen propo&s;ing them&s;elves as tru&s;tees and found|ers, the de&s;ign was &s;o well approved of by the public-&s;pirited citizens of Philadelphia, that the &s;um of eight hundred pounds per annum, for five years, was in the cour&s;e of a few weeks &s;ub&s;cribed for carrying the plan into execution; and in the beginning of Ja|nuary following (viz. 1750) three of the &s;chools were opened, namely, the Latin and Greek &s;chools. The Mathematical, and the Engli&s;h &s;chools. In pur&s;uance of an article in the original plan, a &s;chool for educating &s;ixty boys and thirty girls (in the charter &s;ince called the Charitable School) was open|ed, and amid&s;t all the difficulties with which the tru&s;tees have &s;truggled in re&s;pect to their funds, has &s;till been continued full for the &s;pace of forty years; &s;o that allowing three years education for each boy and girl admit|ted into it, which is the general rule, at lea&s;t twelve hundred children have received in it the chief part of their education, who might otherwi&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, have been left without the means of in&s;truction. And many of tho&s;e who have been thus educated, are now to be found among the mo&s;t u&s;eful and reputable citizens of this &s;tate.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution, thus &s;ucce&s;sfully begun, continued daily to flouri&s;h, to the great &s;a|tisfaction of Dr. Franklin; who, notwith|&s;tanding the multiplicity of his other engage|ments

Through the interpo&s;ition of his be|nevolent and learned friend, Peter Collin&s;on of London, upon the application of the tru&s;|tees, a charter of incorporation, dated July 13, 1753, was obtained from the honourable proprietors of Pennylvania, Thomas Penn and Richard Penn, <ABBR>E&s;qrs</ABBR> accompanied with a liberal benefaction of five hundred pounds &s;terling; and Dr. Franklin now began in good earne&s;t to plea&s;e him&s;elf with the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of a &s;peedy accompli&s;hment of his original de&s;ign, viz. the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a perfect in&s;titution, upon the plan of the European colleges and univer&s;ities; for which his academy was intended as a nur&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry or foun|dation. To elucidate this fact, is a matter of con&s;iderable importance in re&s;pect to the memory and character of Dr. Franklin, as a philo&s;opher, and as the friend and patron of learning and &s;cience; for, notwith&s;tanding what is expre&s;sly declared by him in the pre|amble to the con&s;titutions, viz. that the aca|demy was begun for "teaching the Latin and Greek languages with all u&s;eful branches of the arts and &s;ciences, &s;uitable to the &s;tate

</LETTER>
<P>About a month after the date of this la&s;t letter, the gentleman to whom it was addre&s;|&s;ed arrived in Philadelphia, and was immedi|ately placed at the head of the &s;eminary; where|by Dr. Franklin, and the other tru&s;tees were enabled to pro&s;ecute their plan, for perfecting the in&s;titution, and opening the college upon the large and liberal foundation on which it now &s;tands; for which purpo&s;e they obtain|ed their additional charter, dated May 27th, 1755.</P>
<P>Thus far we thought proper to exhibit in one view Dr. Franklin's &s;ervices in the foun|dation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of this &s;eminary. He &s;oon afterward embarked for England, in the public &s;ervice of his country; and having been generally employed abroad, in the like &s;ervice, for the greate&s;t part of the remain|der of his life (as will appear in our &s;ub&s;e|quent account of the &s;ame) he had but few opportunities of taking any further active part in the affairs of the &s;eminary, until his
<PB N="152" REF="027004_0152_0FD2DE9932BC1920">final return in the year 1785, when he found its charters violated, and his ancient col|leagues, the original founders, deprived of their tru&s;t, by an act of the legi&s;lature; and although his own name had been in&s;erted among the new tru&s;tees, yet he declined to take his &s;eat among them, or any concern in the management of their affairs, till the in|&s;titution was re&s;tored by law to its original owners. He then a&s;&s;embled his old colleagues at his own hou&s;e, and being cho&s;en their pre&s;ident, all their future meetings were, at his reque&s;t, held there, till within a few months of his death, when with reluctance, and at their de&s;ire, lea&s;t he might be too much injured by his attention to their bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he &s;uffered them to meet at the college.</P>
<P>Franklin not only gave birth to many u&s;e|ful in&s;titutions him&s;elf, but he was al&s;o in|&s;trumental in promoting tho&s;e which had ori|ginated with other men. About the year 1752, an eminent phy&s;ician of this city, Dr. Bond, con&s;idering the deplorable &s;tate of the poor, when vi&s;ited with di&s;ea&s;e, conceived the idea of e&s;tabli&s;hing an ho&s;pital. Notwith&s;tanding very great exertions on his part, he was able to intere&s;t few people &s;o far in his benevolent plan, as to obtain &s;ub&s;criptions from them. Unwilling that his &s;cheme &s;hould prove abortive, he &s;ought the aid of Franklin, who readily engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s, both by u&s;ing his influence with his friends, and by &s;tating the advantageous influence of the propo&s;ed
<PB N="153" REF="027004_0153_0FD2DE9F077FD878">in&s;titution in his paper. The&s;e efforts were attended with &s;ucce&s;s. Con&s;iderable &s;ums were &s;ub&s;cribed; but they were &s;till &s;hort of what was nece&s;&s;ary. Franklin now made an|other exertion. He applied to the a&s;&s;em|bly; and, after &s;ome oppo&s;ition, obtained leave to bring in a bill, &s;pecifying, that as &s;oon as two thou&s;and pounds were &s;ub&s;cribed, the &s;ame &s;um &s;hould be drawn from the trea&s;ury by the &s;peaker's warrant, to be applied to the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution. The oppo&s;iti|on, as the &s;um was granted upon a contin|gency which they &s;uppo&s;ed would never take place, were &s;ilent, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed. The friends of the plan now redoubled their ef|forts, to obtain &s;ub&s;criptions to the amount &s;tated in the bill, and were &s;oon &s;ucce&s;sful. This was the foundation of the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, which, with the Bettering-hou&s;e and Di&s;pen&s;ary, bears ample te&s;timony of the humanity of the citizens of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin had conducted him&s;elf &s;o well in the office of po&s;t-ma&s;ter, and had &s;hown him&s;elf to be &s;o well acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of that department, that it was thought expedient to rai&s;e him to a more dignified &s;tation. In 1753 he was appointed deputy po&s;t-ma&s;ter-general for the Briti&s;h co|lonies. The profits ari&s;ing from the po&s;tage of the revenue, which the crown of Great Britain derived from the colonies. In the hands of Franklin, it is &s;aid, that the po&s;t|office in America yielded annually thrice as much as that of Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="027004_0154_0FD2DE9FFAC6EFA0">
The American colonies were much expo&s;ed to depredations on their frontiers, by the In|dians; and more particularly whenever a war took place between France and England. The colonies, individually, were either too weak to take efficient mea&s;ures for their own de|fence, or they were unwilling to take upon them&s;elves the whole burden of erecting forts and maintaining garri&s;ons, whil&s;t their neigh|bours, who partook equally with them&s;elves, of the advantages, contributed nothing to the expence. Sometimes al&s;o the di&s;putes, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in between the governors and a&s;&s;emblies, prevented the adoption of means of defence; as we have &s;een was the ca&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania in 1745. To devi&s;e a plan of union between the colonies, to regulate this and other matters, appeared a de&s;irable ob|ject. To accompli&s;h this, in the year 1754, commi&s;&s;ioners from New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn|&s;ylvania, and Maryland, met at Albany. Dr. Franklin attended here, as a commi&s;&s;ioner from Penn&s;ylvania, and produced a plan, which, from the place of meeting, has been u&s;ually termed "The Albany Plan of Uni|on." This propo&s;ed, that application &s;hould be made for an act of parliament, to e&s;tabli&s;h in the colonies a general government, to be admini&s;tered by a pre&s;ident-general, appoint|ed by the crown, and by a grand council, con&s;i&s;ting of members cho&s;en by the repre|&s;entatives of the different colonies; their
<PB N="155" REF="027004_0155_0FD2DEA2D1F64058">number to be in direct proportion to the &s;ums paid by each colony into the general trea&s;ury, with this re&s;triction, that no colony &s;hould have more than &s;even, nor le&s;s than two repre&s;entatives. The whole executive authority was committed to the pre&s;ident-ge|neral. The power of legi&s;lation was lodged in the grand council and pre&s;ident-general jointly; his con&s;ent being made nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ing a bill into a law. The power ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident and council were, to declare war and peace, and to conclude treaties with the Indian nations; to regulate trade with, and to make purcha&s;es of vacant lands from them, either in the name of the crown, or of the union; to &s;ettle new colonies, to make laws for governing the&s;e until they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be erected into &s;eparate governments, and to rai&s;e troops, build forts, fit out armed ve&s;&s;els and u&s;e other means for the general defence; and to affect the&s;e things, a power was given to make laws, laying &s;uch duties, impo&s;ts, or taxes, as they &s;hould find ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ary, and as would be lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to the people. All laws were to be &s;ent to England for the king's approbation; and un|le&s;s di&s;approved of within three years, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> remain in force. All officers in the land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ea &s;ervice were to be nominated by the re&s;ident-general, and approved of by the general council; civil officers were to be no|minated by the council, and approved by the re&s;ident. Such are the out-lines of the
<PB N="156" REF="027004_0156_0FD2DEA5CA084878">plan propo&s;ed, for the con&s;ideration of the congre&s;s, by Dr. Franklin. After &s;everal days di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to by the commi&s;&s;ioners, a copy tran&s;mitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> each a&s;&s;embly, and one to the king's council. The fate of it was &s;ingular. It was di&s;approved of by the mini&s;try of Great-Britain, becau&s;e it gave too much power to the repre&s;entatives of the people; and it was rejected by every a&s;&s;embly, as giving to the pre&s;ident-general, the repre&s;entative of the crown, an influence greater than appeared to them proper, in a plan of government intended for freemen. Perhaps this rejection, on both &s;ides, is the &s;tronge&s;t proof that could be adduced of the excellence of it, as &s;uited to the &s;ituation of America and Great-Britain at that time. It appears to have &s;teered exactly in the middle, between the oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts of both.</P>
<P>Whether the adoption of this plan would have prevented the &s;eparation of America from Great-Britain, is a que&s;tion which might afford much room for &s;peculation. It may be &s;aid, that, by enabling the colonies to de|fend them&s;elves, it would have removed the pretext upon which the &s;tamp-act, tea-act, and other acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, were pa&s;&s;ed: which excited a &s;pirit of oppo|&s;ition, and laid the foundation for the &s;epa|ration of the two countries. But, on the other hand, it mu&s;t be admitted, that the re|&s;triction laid by Great-Britain upon our com|merce, obliging us to &s;ell our produce to her
<PB N="157" REF="027004_0157_0FD2DEA7A17F4970">citizens only, and to take from them various articles, of which, as our manufactures were di&s;couraged, we &s;tood in need, at a price greater than that for which they could have been obtained from other nations, mu&s;t ine|vitably produce di&s;&s;atisfaction, even though no duties were impo&s;ed by the parliament; a circum&s;tance which might &s;till have taken place. Be&s;ides, as the pre&s;ident-general was to be appointed by the crown, he mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be devoted to its views, and would, therefore, refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to any laws, how|ever &s;alutary to the community, which had the mo&s;t remote tendency to injure the inte|re&s;ts of his &s;overeign. Even &s;hould they re|ceive his a&s;&s;ent, the approbation of the king was to be nece&s;&s;ary; who would indubitably, in every in&s;tance, prefer the advantage of his home dominions to that of his colonies. Hence would en&s;ue perpetual di&s;agreements between the council and the pre&s;ident-gene|ral, and thus, between the people of America and the crown of Great Britain: While the colonies continued weak, they would be obliged to &s;ubmit, and as &s;oon as they acquir|ed &s;trength they would be more urgent in their demands, until, at length, they would &s;hake off the yoke, and declare them&s;elves independent.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, their trade with the natives ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended very far; even to the back of the Briti&s;h &s;et|tlements. They were di&s;po&s;ed, from time to
<PB N="158" REF="027004_0158_0FD2DEAE18300058">time, to e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts within the territory, which the Briti&s;h claimed as their own. In|dependent of the injury to the fur-trade, which was con&s;iderable, the colonies &s;uffered this further inconvenience, that the Indians were frequently in&s;tigated to commit depre|dations on their frontiers. In the year 1753, encroachments were made upon the bounda|ries of Virginia. Remon&s;trances had no ef|fect. In the en&s;uing year, a body of men was &s;ent out under the command of Mr. Wa&s;hington, who, though a very young man, had, by his conduct in the preceding year, &s;hewn him&s;elf worthy of &s;uch an im|portant tru&s;t. Whil&s;t marching to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;t at the junction of the Al|legany and Monongahela, he was informed that the French had already erected a fort there. A detachment of their men marched again&s;t him. He fortified him&s;elf as &s;trong|ly as time and circum&s;tances would admit. A &s;uperiority of numbers &s;oon obliged him to &s;urrender <HI>Fort Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> He obtained ho|nourable terms for him&s;elf and men, and returned to Virginia. The government of Great-Britain now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to in|terfere. In the year 1755, General Brad|dock, with &s;ome regiments of regular troops, and provincial levies, was &s;ent to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the French of the po&s;ts upon which they had &s;eized. After the men were all ready, a dif|ficulty occurred, which had nearly prevented the expedition. This was the want of wag|gons.
<PB N="159" REF="027004_0159_0FD2DEAFB5113C50">Franklin now &s;tepped forward, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;on, in a little time procured a hundred and fifty. Braddock un|fortunately fell into an ambu&s;cade, and per|i&s;hed, with a number of his men. Wa&s;h|ington, who had accompanied him as an aid-de-camp, and had warned him, in vain, of his danger, now di&s;played great military talents in effecting a retreat of the remains of the army, and in forming a junction with the rear, under coloned Dunbar, upon whom the cheif command now devolved. With &s;ome difficulty they brought their little body to a place of &s;afety; but they found it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy their waggons and baggage, to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. For the waggons which he had fur|ni&s;hed, Franklin had given bonds to a large amount. The owners declared their inten|tions of obliging him to make a re&s;titution of their property. Had they put their threats in execution, ruin mu&s;t inevitably have been the con&s;equence. Governor Shirley, finding that he had incurred the&s;e debts for the &s;er|vice of government, made arrangements to have them di&s;charged, and relea&s;ed Franklin from his di&s;agreeable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The alarm &s;pread through the colonies, af|ter the defeat of Braddock, was very great. Preparations to arm were every where made. In Penn&s;ylvania, the prevalence of the qua|ker intere&s;t prevented the adoption of any &s;y&s;tem of defence, which would compel the
<PB N="160" REF="027004_0160_0FD2DEB14E0416C8">citizens to bear arms. Franklin introduced into the a&s;&s;embly a bill for organizing a mili|tia, by which every man was allowed to take arms or not, as to him &s;hould appear fit. The quakers, being thus left at liberty, &s;uf|fered the bill to pa&s;s; for although their prin|ciples would not &s;uffer them to fight, they had no objections to their neighbours fighting for them. In con&s;equence of this act a very re&s;pectable militia was formed. The &s;en&s;e of impending danger infu&s;ed a military &s;pirit in all, who&s;e religious tenets were not oppo&s;ed to war. Franklin was appointed colonel of a regiment in Philadelphia, which con&s;i&s;ted of 1200 men.</P>
<P>The north-we&s;tern frontier being invaded by the enemy, it became nece&s;&s;ary to adopt mea&s;ures for its defence. Franklin was di|rected by the governor to take charge of this bu&s;ine&s;s. A power of rai&s;ing men, and of appointing officers to command them, was ve&s;ted in him. He &s;oon levied a body of troops, with which he repaired to the place at which their pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary. Here he built a fort, and placed the garri&s;on in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence, as would enable them to with&s;tand the inroads, to which the inha|bitants had previou&s;ly been expo&s;ed. He re|mained here for &s;ome time, in order the more completely to di&s;charge the tru&s;t committed to him. Some bu&s;ine&s;s of importance ren|dered his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary in the a&s;&s;embly, and he returned to Philadelphia.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="027004_0161_0FD2DEDAC45CF950">
The defence of her colonies was a great expence to Great Britain. The mo&s;t effectual mode of le&s;&s;ening this war, was to put arms into the hands of the inhabitants, and to teach them their u&s;e. But England wi&s;hed not that the Americans &s;hould become ac|quainted with their own &s;trength. She was apprehen&s;ive, that, as &s;oon as this period ar|rived, they would no longer &s;ubmit to that monopoly of their trade, which to them was highly injurious, but extremely advantage|ous to the mother country. In compari&s;on with the profits of this, the expence of maintain|ing armies and fleets to defend them was tri|fling. She &s;ought to keep them dependent upon her for protection, the be&s;t plan which could be devi&s;ed for retaining them in peace|able &s;ubjection, the lea&s;t appearance of a mi|litary &s;pirit was therefore to be guarded a|gain&s;t, and, although a war then raged, the act organizing a militia was di&s;approved of by the mini&s;try. The regiments which had been formed under it were di&s;banded, and the defence of the province entru&s;ted to re|gular troops.</P>
<P>The di&s;putes between the proprietaries and the people continued in full force, although a war was raging on the frontiers. Not even the &s;en&s;e of danger was &s;ufficient to reconcile, for ever &s;o &s;hort a time, their jarring intere&s;ts. The a&s;&s;embly &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the ju&s;tice of taxing the proprietary e&s;tates, but the gover|nors con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to give their a&s;&s;ent to
<PB N="162" REF="027004_0162_0FD2DEB2C71E3460">this mea&s;ure, without which no bill could pa&s;s into a law. Enraged at the ob&s;tinacy, and what they conceived to be unju&s;t pro|ceedings of their opponents, the a&s;&s;embly at length determined to apply to the mother country for relief. A petition was addre&s;&s;ed to the king, in council, &s;tating the inconve|niencies under which the inhabitants labour|ed, from the attention of the proprietaries to their private intere&s;ts, to the neglect of the general welfare of the community, and pray|ing for redre&s;s. Franklin was appointed to pre&s;ent this addre&s;s, as agent for the province of Penn&s;ylvania, and departed from America in June 1757. In conformity to the in&s;truc|tions which he had received from the legi&s;la|ture, he held a conference with the proprie|taries, who then re&s;ided, in England, and endeavoured to prevail upon them to give up the long-conte&s;ted point. Finding that they would hearken to no terms of accommodation, he laid his petition before the council. Du|ring this time governor Denny a&s;&s;ented to a law impo&s;ing a tax, in which no di&s;crimina|tion was made in favour of the e&s;tates of the Penn family. They, alarmed at this intelli|gence, and Frankin's exertions, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t exertions to prevent the royal &s;anction being given to this law, which they repre&s;ent|ed as highly iniquitous, de&s;igned to throw the burthen, of &s;upporting government on them, and calculated to produce the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences to them and their po&s;terity.
<PB N="163" REF="027004_0163_0FD2DEDC00F792E8">The cau&s;e was amply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before the pri|vy council. The Penns found here &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|nuous advocates; nor were there wanting &s;ome who warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ide of the people. After &s;ome time &s;pent in debate, a propo&s;al was made, that Franklin &s;hould &s;o|lemnly engage, that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the tax &s;hould be &s;o made, as that the proprietary e&s;tates &s;hould pay no more than a due pro|portion. This he agreed to perform, the Peen family withdrew their oppo&s;ition, and tranquility was thus once more re&s;tored to the province.</P>
<P>The mode in which this di&s;pute was termi|nated is a &s;triking proof of the high opinion entertained of Franklin's integrity and ho|nour, even by tho&s;e who con&s;idered him as inimical to their views. Nor was their con|fidence ill-founded. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was made upon the &s;tricte&s;t principles of equity; and the proprietary e&s;tates bore only a pro|portionable &s;hare of the expences of &s;upport|ing government.</P>
<P>After the completion of this important bu|&s;ine&s;s, Franklin remained at the court of Great Britain, as agent for the province of Penn&s;yl|vania. The exten&s;ive knowledge which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ituation of the colonies, and the regard which he always manife&s;ted for their intere&s;ts, occa&s;ioned his appointment to the &s;ame office by the colonies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Maryland, and Georgia. His conduct, in this &s;ituation, was &s;uch as rendered him &s;till more dear to his countryman.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="027004_0164_0FD2DEB4D9032320">
He had now an oppertunity of indulging in the &s;ociety of tho&s;e friends, whom his mer|its had procured him while at a di&s;tance. The regard which they had entertained for him was rather increa&s;ed by a per&s;onal acquaint|ance. The oppo&s;ition which had been made to his di&s;coveries in philo&s;ophy gradually cea&s;|ed, and the rewards of literary merit were a|bundantly conferred upon him. The royal &s;o|ciety of London, which had at fir&s;t refu&s;ed his performances admi&s;&s;ion into its tran&s;actions, now thought it an honour to rank him among its fellows. Other &s;ocieties of Europe were equally ambitious of calling him a member. The univer&s;ity of St. Andrew's, in Scotland, conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws. Its example was followed by the uni|ver&s;ities of Edinburgh and of Oxford. His corre&s;pondence was &s;ought for by the mo&s;t eminent philo&s;ophers of Europe. His letters to the&s;e abound with true &s;cince, delivered in the mo&s;t &s;imple unadorned manner.</P>
<P>The province of Canada was at this time in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, who had orig|inally &s;ettled it. The trade with the Indians, for which its &s;ituation was very convenient, was exceedingly lucrative. The French tra|ders here found a market for their commodi|ties, and received in return large quantities of rich furs, which they di&s;po&s;ed of at a high price in Europe. Whil&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country was highly advantageous to France, it was a grievous inconvenience to the inhab|itants
<PB N="165" REF="027004_0165_0FD2DEDE91C9A660">of the Briti&s;h colonies. The Indians were almo&s;t generally de&s;irous to cultivate the friend&s;hip of the French, by whom they were a|bundantly &s;upplied with arms and ammunition, Whenever a war happened, the Indians were ready to fall upon the frontiers: and this they frequently did, even when Great Britain and and France were at peace. From the&s;e con|&s;iderations, it appeared to be the intere&s;t of Great Britain to gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Can|ada. But the importance of &s;uch an acqui|&s;ition was not well under&s;tood in England. Franklin about this time publi&s;hed his Cana|da pamphlet, in which he, in a very forcible manner, pointed out the advantages which would re&s;ult from the conque&s;t of this prov|ince.</P>
<P>An expedition again&s;t it was planned, and the command given to General Wolfe. His &s;ucce&s;s is well known. At the treaty in 1762, France ceded Canada to Great Britain, and by her ce&s;&s;ion of Loui&s;iana, at the &s;ame time, relinqui&s;hed all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent of America.</P>
<P>Although Dr. Franklin was now principally occupied with political pur&s;uits, he found time for philo&s;ophical &s;tudies. He extended his electrical re&s;earches, and made a variety of experiments, particularly an the tourmalin. The &s;ingular properties which this &s;tone po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es of being electrified on one &s;ide po&s;itiv|ely and on the other negatively, by heat a|lone, without friction, had been but lately ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="027004_0166_0FD2DEB6D2688258">
Some experiments on the cold produced by evaporation, made by Dr. Cullen, had been communicated to Dr. Franklin by Profe&s;&s;or Simp&s;on of Gla&s;gow. The&s;e he repeated, and found, that, by the evaporation of ether in the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump, &s;o great a degree of cold was produced in a &s;ummer's day, that water was converted into ice. This di&s;covery he applied to the &s;olu|tion of a number of phenomena, particularly a &s;ingular fact, which philo&s;ophers had en|deavoured in vain to account for, viz. that the temperature of the human body, when in health, never exceeds 96 degrees of Faren|heit's thermometers, although the atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds it may be heated to a much greater degree. This he attributed to the increa&s;ed per&s;piration, and con&s;equent evapo|ration, produced by the heat.</P>
<P>In a letter to Mr. Small of London, dated in May 1760, Dr. Franklin makes a number ob&s;ervations, tending to &s;hew that, in North America, north-ea&s;t &s;torms being in the &s;outh-we&s;t parts. It appears, from actual ob&s;erva|tion, that a north-ea&s;t &s;torm, which extended a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, commenced at Phila|delphia nearly four hours before it was felt at Bo&s;ton. He endeavoured to account for this, by &s;uppo&s;ing that from heat, &s;ome rarefaction takes place about the gulph of Mexico, that the air further north being cooler ru&s;hes in, and is &s;ucceeded by the cooler and den&s;er air &s;till further north, and thus a continued cur|rent is at length produced.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="027004_0167_0FD2DEE16F01FF20">
The tone produced by rubbing the brim of a drinking gla&s;s with a wet finger had been gen|erally known. A Mr. Puckeridge, and Iri&s;hman, by placing on a table a number of gla&s;&s;es of different &s;izes, and tuning them by partly fil|ling them with water, endeavoured to form an in&s;trument capable of playing tunes. He was prevented by an untimely end, from bringing his invention to any degree of perfection. After his death &s;ome improvements were made upon his plan. The &s;weetne&s;s of the tones induced Dr. Franklin to make a variety of experiments; and he at length formed that elegant in&s;trument, which he has called the <HI>Armonica.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1762 he returned to Ame|rica. On his pa&s;&s;age he ob&s;erved the &s;ingular effect produced by the agitation of a ve&s;&s;el, containing oil floating on water. The &s;urface of the oil remains &s;mooth and undi&s;turbed, whil&s;t the water is agitated with the utmo&s;t commotion. No &s;atisfactory explanation of this appearance has, we believe, ever been given.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin received the thanks of the a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, "as well for the faithful di&s;charge of his duty to that province in particular, as for the many and impor|tant &s;ervices done to America in general, during his re&s;idence in Great Britain." A compen&s;ation of 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> Penn&s;ylvania cur|rency, was al&s;o decreed him for his &s;ervices during &s;ix years.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="027004_0168_0FD2DEB7F448C7E8">
During his ab&s;ence he had been annually elected member of the a&s;&s;embly. On his re|turn to Penn&s;ylvania he again took his &s;eat in this body, and continued a &s;teady defender of the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>In December 1762, a circum&s;tance which cau&s;ed great alarm in the province took place. A number of Indians had re&s;ided in the coun|try at Lanca&s;ter, and conducted them&s;elves uniformly as friends to the white inhabitants. Repeated depredations on the frontiers had exa&s;perated the inhabitants to &s;uch a degree, that they determined to revenge upon every Indian. A number of per&s;ons, to the amount of 120, principally inhabitants of Donne|gal and Peck&s;tang or Paxton town&s;hips, in the county of York, a&s;&s;embled; and, mount|ed on hor&s;eback, proceeded to the &s;ettlement of the&s;e harmle&s;s and defencele&s;s Indians, who&s;e number had now reduced to about twenty. The Indians received intelligence of the attack which was intended again&s;t them, but di&s;believed it. Con&s;idering the white people as their friends, they apprehended no danger from them. When the party arrived at the Indian &s;ettlement, they found only &s;ome women and children, and a few old men, the re&s;t being ab&s;ent at work. They murdered all whom they found, and among&s;t others the chief Shahaes, who had been always di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for his friend&s;hip to the whites. This bloody deed excited much indignation in the well-di&s;po&s;ed part of the community.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="027004_0169_0FD2DDE2F218C888">
The remainder of the&s;e unfortunate Indians, who, by ab&s;ence, had e&s;caped the ma&s;&s;acre, were conducted to Lanca&s;ter, and lodged in the jail, as a place of &s;ecurity. The governor i&s;&s;ued a proclamation expre&s;&s;ing the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;approbation of the action, offering a re|ward for the di&s;covery of the perpetrators of the deed; and prohibiting all injuries to the peaceable Indians in future. But notwith&s;tand|ing this, a party of the &s;ame men &s;hortly af|ter marched to Lanca&s;ter, broke open the jail, and inhumanly butchered the innocent Indians who had been placed there for &s;ecuri|ty. Another proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, but had no effect. A detachment marched down to Philadelphia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of murdering &s;ome friendly Indians, who had been removed to the city for &s;afety. A num|ber of the citizens armed in their defence. The Quakers, who&s;e principles are oppo&s;ed to fighting, even in their defence, were mo&s;t active upon this occa&s;ion. The rioters came to Germantown. The governor fled for &s;afe|ty to the hou&s;e of Dr. Franklin, who, with &s;ome others, advanced to meet the Paxton boys, as they were called, and had influence enough to prevail upon them to relinqui&s;h their under&s;tanding, and return to their homes.</P>
<P>The di&s;putes between the proprietaries and the a&s;&s;embly, which, for a time, had &s;ub&s;ided, were again revived. The proprietaries were di&s;&s;atisfied with the conce&s;&s;ions made in favour of the people, and made great &s;truggles to
<PB N="170" REF="027004_0170_0FD2DEBC25196FC0">recover the privilege of exempting their e&s;|tates from taxation, which they had been in|duced to give up.</P>
<P>In 1763 the a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed a militia bill, to which the governor refu&s;ed to give his a&s;|&s;ent, unle&s;s the a&s;&s;embly would agree to cer|tain amendments which he propo&s;ed. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted in increa&s;ing the fines, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;ub&s;tituting death for fines. He wi&s;h|ed too that the officers &s;hould be appointed altogether by him&s;elf, and not be nominated by the people, as the bill had propo&s;ed. The&s;e amendments the a&s;&s;embly con&s;idered as incon|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of liberty. They would not adopt them; the governor was ob&s;tinate, and the bill was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and various other circum&s;tances, increa&s;ed the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the proprietaries and the a&s;&s;embly, to &s;uch a degree, that, in 1764, a petition to the king was agreed to by the hou&s;e, proving an alteration from a <HI>proprietary</HI> to a <HI>regal</HI> gov|ernment. Great oppo&s;ition was made to this mea&s;ure, not only in the hou&s;e but in the public prints. A &s;peech of Mr. Dicken&s;on, on the &s;ubject, was publi&s;hed, with a preface by Dr. Smith, in which great pains were ta|ken to &s;hew the impropriety and impolicy of this proceeding. A &s;peech of Mr. Gallo|way in reply to Mr. Dicken&s;on was pub|li&s;hed, accompained with a preface by Dr. Franklin; in which he ably oppo&s;ed the principles laid down in the preface to Mr. Dicken&s;on's &s;peech. This application
<PB N="171" REF="027004_0171_0FD2DEE727070720">to the throne produced no effect. The pro|prietary government was &s;till continued.</P>
<P>At the election for a new a&s;&s;embly, in the fall of 1764, the friends of the proprietaries made great exertions to exclude tho&s;e of the adver&s;e party, and obtained a &s;mall majority in the city of Philadelphia. Franklin now lo&s;t his &s;eat in the hou&s;e, which he had held for fourteen years. On the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, it appeared that there was &s;till a de|cided majority of Franklin's friends. He was immediately appointed provincial agent to the great chagrin of his enemies, who made a &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t his appointment; which was refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion upon the minutes, as being unprecedented. It was, however, pub|li&s;hed in the papers, and produced a &s;pirited reply from him, ju&s;t before his departure for England.</P>
<P>The de&s;turbances produced in America by Mr. Grenville's &s;tamp-act, and the oppo&s;ition made to it, are well known. Under the marquis of Rockingham's admini&s;tration, it appeared expedient to endeavour to calm the minds of the coloni&s;ts; and the repeal of the odious tax was contemplated. Among&s;t other means of collecting information on the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to &s;ubmit to it, Dr. Franklin was called to the bar of the hou&s;e of commons. The examination which he here underwent was publi&s;hed, and contains a &s;triking proof of the extent and accuracy of his information, and the facility with which he communicated
<PB N="172" REF="027004_0172_0FD2DEBDDE183558">his &s;entiments. He repre&s;ented facts in &s;o &s;trong a point of view, that the inexpediency of the act mu&s;t have appeared clear to every unprejudiced mind. The act, after &s;ome op|po&s;ition, was repealed, about a year after it was enacted, and before it had ever been car|ried into execution.</P>
<P>In the year 1766, he made a vi&s;it to Hol|land and Germany, and received the greate&s;t marks of attention from men of &s;cience. In his pa&s;&s;age through Holland, he learned from the watermen the effect which a diminution of the quantity of water in canals has, in im|peding the progre&s;s of boats. Upon his re|turn to England, he was led to make a num|ber of experiments; all of which tended to confirm the ob&s;ervation. The&s;e, with an ex|planation of the phenomenon, he communi|cated in a letter to his friend, Sir John Prin|gle, which is contained in the volume of his philo&s;ophical pieces.</P>
<P>In the following year he travelled into France, where he met with a no le&s;s favour|able reception than he had experienced in Ger|many. He was introduced to a number of literary characters, and to the king, Louis XV.</P>
<P>Several letters written by Hutchin&s;on, Ol|iver, and others, to per&s;ons in eminent &s;tations in Great Britain, came into the hands of Dr. Franklin.</P>
<P>The&s;e contained the mo&s;t violent invectives again&s;t the leading characters of the &s;tate of
<PB N="173" REF="027004_0173_0FD2DEE84AC1E418">Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;ed the pro&s;ecution of vigorous mea&s;ures, to compel the people to obedience to the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. The&s;e he tran&s;mitted to the legi&s;lature, by whom they were publi&s;hed. Atte&s;ted copies of them were &s;ent to Great Britain, with an addre&s;s, praying the king to di&s;charge from office per&s;ons who had ren|dered them&s;elves &s;o obnoxious to the people, and who had &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o unfriendly to their intere&s;ts. The publication of the&s;e letters produced a duel between Mr. Whately and Mr. Temple; each of whom was &s;u&s;pect|ed of having been in&s;trumental in procuring them. To prevent any further di&s;putes on this &s;ubject, Dr. Franklin, in one of the pub|lic papers, declared that he had &s;ent them to America, but would give no information con|cerning the manner in which he had obtained them; nor was this ever di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Shortly after, the petition of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts a&s;&s;embly was taken up for examination, before the privy council. Dr. Franklin at|tended, as agent for the a&s;&s;embly; and here a torrent of the mo&s;t violent and unwarrant|ed abu&s;e was poured upon him by the &s;olici|tor-general, Wedderburne, who was engag|ed as council for Oliver and Hutchin&s;on. The petition was declared to be &s;candalous and vexatious, and the prayer of it refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Although the parliament of Great Britain had repealed the &s;tamp-act, it was only upon the principle of expediency. They &s;till in|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="174" REF="027004_0174_0FD2DEBECA7A1930">upon their right to tax the colonies; and, at the &s;ame time that the &s;tamp-act was repealed, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the right of parliament to bind the colonies in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. This language was u&s;ed even by the mo&s;t &s;trenuous oppo&s;ers of the &s;tamp-act; and, among&s;t others, by Mr. Pitt. This right was never recognized by the colo|ni&s;ts; but, as they flattered them&s;elves that it would not be exerci&s;ed, they were not very active in remon&s;trating again&s;t it. Had this pretended right been &s;uffered to remain dor|mant, the coloni&s;ts would cheerfully have fini&s;hed their quota of &s;upplies, in the mode to which they had been accu&s;tomed; that is, by acts of their own a&s;&s;emblies, in con&s;equence of requi&s;itions from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. If this practice had been pur&s;ued, &s;uch was the di&s;po&s;ition of the colonies towards the moth|er country, that, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;ad|vantages under which they laboured, from re&s;traints upon their trade, calculated &s;ole|ly for the benefit of the commercial and manufacturing intere&s;ts of Great Britain, a &s;eparation of the two countries might have been a far di&s;tant event. The Americans, from their earlie&s;t infancy, were taught to venerate a people from whom they were de|&s;cended; who&s;e language, laws and manners, were the &s;ame as their own. They looked up to them as models of perfection; and, in their prejudiced minds, the mo&s;t enlightened nations of Europe were con&s;idered as almo&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="027004_0175_0FD2DEBECA7A1930">barbarians, in compari&s;on with Engli&s;hmen. The name of an Engli&s;hman conveyed to an American the idea of every thing good and great. Such &s;entiments in&s;tilled into them in early life, what but a repetition of unju&s;t treatment could have induced them to enter|tain the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of &s;eparation! The duties on gla&s;s, paper, leather, painter's colours, tea, &amp;c. the disfranchi&s;ement of &s;ome of the colonies: the ob&s;truction to the mea&s;ures of the legi&s;lature in others, by the king's governors; the contemptuous treat|ment of their humble remon&s;trances, &s;tating their grievances and praying a redre&s;s of them, and other violent and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, at length excited an ardent &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition. In&s;tead of endeavouring to allay this by a more lenient conduct, the mini&s;try &s;eemed re&s;olutely bent upon reducing the colonies to the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h obedience to their decrees. But this tended only to aggravate. Vain were all the efforts made u&s;e of to prevail upon them to lay a&s;ide their de&s;igns, to convince them of the impo&s;&s;ibility of carrying them into effect, and of the mi&s;chievous con&s;e|quences which mu&s;t in&s;ue from a continuance of the attempt. They per&s;evered, with a degree of inflexibility &s;carcely paralleled.</P>
<P>The advantages which Great Britain deri|ved from her colonies were &s;o great, that nothing but a degree of infatuation, little &s;hort of madne&s;s, could have produced a con|tinuance of mea&s;ures calculated to keep up a
<PB N="176" REF="027004_0176_0FD2DEC05E8F0368">&s;pirit of unea&s;ine&s;s, which might occa&s;ion the &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;h for a &s;eparation. When we con&s;ider the great improvements in the &s;cience of government, the general diffu&s;ion of the principles of liberty among&s;t the people of Europe, the effects they have already produ|ced in France, and the probable con&s;equen|ces which will re&s;ult from them el&s;ewhere, all of which are the offspring of the Ameri|can revolution, it cannot but appear &s;trange, that events of &s;o great moment to the happi|ne&s;s of mankind, &s;hould have been ultimate|ly occa&s;ioned by the wickedne&s;s or ignorance of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin left nothing untried to pre|vail upon the mini&s;try to con&s;ent to a change of mea&s;ures. In private conver&s;ations, and in letters to per&s;ons in government, he con|tinually expatiated upon the impolicy and inju&s;tice of their conduct towards America; and &s;tated, that, notwith&s;tanding the attach|ment of the coloni&s;ts to the mother country, a repetition of ill treatment mu&s;t ultimately alienate their affections. They li&s;tened not to his advice. They blindly per&s;evered in their own &s;chemes, and left to the coloni&s;ts no alternative, but oppo&s;ition or uncondition|al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The latter accorded not with the principles of freedom, which they had been taught to revere. To the former they were compelled, though reluctantly, to have recour&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin, finding all efforts to re&s;tore
<PB N="177" REF="027004_0177_0FD2DEECD5F3E368">harmony between Great Britain and her col|onies u&s;ele&s;s, returned to America in the year 1775; ju&s;t after the commencement of ho&s;ti|lities. The day after his return he was elect|ed by the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania a mem|ber of congre&s;s. Not long after his election a committee was appointed, con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. Lynch, Mr. Harri&s;on, and him&s;elf, to vi&s;it the camp at Cambridge, and in conjunction with the commander in chief, to endeavour to convince the troops, who&s;e term of enli&s;t|ment was about to expire, of the nece&s;&s;ity of their continuing in the field, and per&s;evering in the cau&s;e of their country.</P>
<P>In the fall of the &s;ame year he vi&s;ited Ca|nada, to endeavour to unite them in the com|mon cau&s;e of liberty; but they could not be prevailed upon to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government. M. Le Roy, in a letter annexed to Abbe Fauchet's eulogium of Dr. Franklin, &s;tates that the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this ne|gociation was occa&s;ioned, in a great degree, by religious animo&s;ities, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the Canadians and their neighbours, &s;ome of whom had at different times burnt their chapels.</P>
<P>When Lord Howe came to America, in 1776, ve&s;ted with power to treat with the col|oni&s;ts, a corre&s;pondence took place between him and Dr. Franklin, on the &s;ubject of a reconciliation. Dr. Franklin was afterwards appointed, together with John Adams and Edward Rutledge, to wait upon the commi&s;|&s;ioners,
<PB N="178" REF="027004_0178_0FD2DEC34D4F1AC0">in order to learn the extent of their power. The&s;e were found to be only to grant pardons upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e were terms which would not be accepted; and the object of the commi&s;&s;ioners could not be obtained.</P>
<P>The momentous que&s;tion of independence was &s;hortly after brought into view, at a time when the fleets and armies, which were &s;ent to enforce obedience, were truly formidable. With an army, numerous indeed, but igno|rant of di&s;cipline, and entirely un&s;killed in the art of war, without money, without a fleet, without allies, and with nothing but the love of liberty to &s;upport them, the col|oni&s;ts determined to &s;eparate from a country, from which they had experienced a repetition of injury and in&s;ult. In this que&s;tion, Dr. Franklin was decidedly in favour of the mea|&s;ure propo&s;ed, and had great influence in bringing over others to his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The public mind had been pretty fully pre|pared for this event, by Mr. Paine's celebrat|ed pamphlet, <HI>Common Sen&s;e.</HI> There is good rea&s;on to believe that Dr. Franklin had no incon&s;iderable &s;hare, at lea&s;t, in furni&s;hing materials for this work.</P>
<P>In the convention which a&s;&s;embled at Phil|adelphia in 1776, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tab|li&s;hing a new form of government for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, Dr. Franklin was cho|&s;en pre&s;ident. The late con&s;titution of this &s;tate, which was the re&s;ult of their delibera|tions, may be con&s;idered as a dige&s;t of his
<PB N="179" REF="027004_0179_0FD2DEEFE0307698">principles of government. The &s;ingle legi&s;|lature, and the plural executive, &s;eem to have been his favourite tenets.</P>
<P>In the latter end of 1776, Dr. Franklin was appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the negociatious which had been &s;et on foot by Silas Deane at the court of France. A conviction of the advantages of a commercial intercour&s;e with America, and a de&s;ire of weakening the Brit|i&s;h empire by di&s;membering it, fir&s;t induced the French court to li&s;ten to propo&s;als of an alliance. But they &s;hewed rather a reluctance to the mea&s;ure, which, by Dr. Franklin's ad|dre&s;s, and particularly by the &s;ucce&s;s of the American arms again&s;t general Burgoyne, was at length overcome; and in February 1778, a treaty of alliance, offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive, was concluded; in con&s;equence of which France became involved in the war with Great Britain.</P>
<P>Perhaps no per&s;on could have been found, more capable of rendering e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to the United States at the court of France, than Dr. Franklin. He was well known as a phi|lo&s;opher, and his character was held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation. He was raceived with the greate&s;t marks of re&s;pect by all the literary characters; and this re&s;pect was extended a|mong&s;t all cla&s;&s;es of men. His per&s;onal in|fluence was hence very con&s;iderable. To the effects of this were added tho&s;e of various performances which he publi&s;hed, tend|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h the credit and charecter of
<PB N="180" REF="027004_0180_0FD2DEC67A994FF0">the United States. To his exertions in this way, may, in no &s;mall degree, be a&s;cribed the &s;ucce&s;s of the loans negociated in Holland and France, which greatly contributed to bringing the war to a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The repeated ill &s;ucce&s;s of their arms, and more particularly the capture of Cornwal|lis and his army, at length convinced the Briti&s;h nation of the impo&s;&s;ibility of reducing the Americans to &s;ubjection. The trading intere&s;t particularly became very clamorous for peace. The mini&s;try were unable longer to oppo&s;e their wi&s;hes. Provi&s;ional articles of peace were agreed to, and &s;igned at Paris on the 30th of November, 1782, by Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, and Mr. Laurens, on the part of the United States; and by Mr. O&s;wald on the part of Great Britain. The&s;e formed the ba&s;is of the definitive treaty, which was concluded the 30th of September 1783, and &s;igned by Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Jay, on the one part, and by Mr. David Hartley on the other.</P>
<P>On the 3d of April 1783, a treaty of am|ity and commerce, betweed the United States and Sweden, was concluded at Paris, by Dr. Franklin and the Count Von Kruitz.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar trearty with Pru&s;&s;ia was concluded in 1785, not long before Dr. Franklin's de|parture from Europe.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin did not fuffer his political pur|&s;uits to engro&s;s his whole attention. Some
<PB N="181" REF="027004_0181_0FD2DEF0F5453500">of his performances made their appearance in Paris. The object of the&s;e was generally the promotion of indu&s;try and oeconomy.</P>
<P>In the year 1784, when animal magneti&s;m made great noi&s;e in the world, particularly at Paris, it was thought a matter of &s;uch im|portance, that the king appointed commi&s;&s;i|oners to examine into the foundation of this pretended &s;cience. Dr. Franklin was one of the number. After a fair and diligent exam|ination, in the cour&s;e of which Me&s;mer re|peated a number of experiments, in the pre|&s;ence of the commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ome of which were tried upon them&s;elves, they determined that it was a mere trick, intended to impo&s;e upon the ignorant and credulous&mdash;Me&s;mer was thus interrupted in his career to wealth and fame, and a mo&s;t in&s;olent attempt to im|po&s;e upon the human under&s;tanding baffled.</P>
<P>The important ends of Dr. Franklin's mi&s;|&s;ion being completed by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of American independence, and the infirmities of age and di&s;ea&s;e coming upon him, he became de&s;irous of returning to his native country. Upon application to congre&s;s to be recalled, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was appointed to &s;ucceed him, in 1785. Sometime in September of the &s;ame year, Dr. Franklin arrived in Philadelphia. He was &s;hortly after cho&s;en member of the &s;u|preme executive council for the city; and &s;oon after was elected pre&s;ident of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When a convention was called to meet in Philadelphia, in 1787, for the purpo&s;e of giv|ing
<PB N="182" REF="027004_0182_0FD2DEC7D7ABFB78">more energy to the government of the union, by revi&s;ing and amending the articles of confederation, Dr. Franklin was appointed a delegate from the State of Penn&s;ylvania. He &s;igned the con&s;titution which they propo&s;ed for the union, and gave it the mo&s;t unequi|vocal marks of his approbation.</P>
<P>A &s;ociety for political enquiries, of which Dr. Franklin was pre&s;ident, was e&s;tabli&s;hed about this period. The meetings were held at his hou&s;e. Two or three e&s;&s;ays read in the &s;ociety were publi&s;hed. It did not long con|tinue.</P>
<P>In the year 1787, two &s;ocieties were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Philadelphia, founded on principles of the mo&s;t liberal and refined humanity&mdash;<HI>The Philadelphia Society for alleviating the mi|&s;eries of public pri&s;ons;</HI> and the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania Society for promoting the abolition of &s;lavery, the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bon|dage, and the improvement of the condition of the African race.</HI> Of each of the&s;e Dr. Frank|lin was pre&s;ident. The labours of the&s;e bo|dies have been crowned with great &s;ucce&s;s; and they continue to pro&s;ecute, with unwea|ried diligence, the laudable de&s;igns for which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin's increa&s;ing infirmities pre|vented his regular attendance at the council-chamber; and, in 1788, he retired wholly from public life.</P>
<P>His con&s;titution had been a remarkably good one. He had been little &s;ubject to di&s;|ea&s;e,
<PB N="183" REF="027004_0183_0FD2DEF29E9A32B0">except an attack of the gout occa&s;ional|ly, until the year 1781, when he was fir&s;t attacked with the &s;ymptoms of the calculous complaint, which continued during his life. During the intervals of pain from this griev|ous di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;pent many cheerful hours, conver&s;ing in the mo&s;t agreeable and in&s;truc|tive manner. His faculties were intirely un|impaired, even to the hour of his death.</P>
<P>His name, as pre&s;ident of the Abolition Society, was &s;igned to the memorial pre&s;ent|ed to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, on the 12th of February 1789, praying them to exert the full extent of pow|er ve&s;ted in them by the con&s;titution, in di&s;|couraging the traffick of the human &s;pecies. This was his la&s;t public act. In the debates to which this memorial gave ri&s;e, &s;everal at|tempts were made to ju&s;tify the trade. In the Federal Gazette of March 25th, there appeared an e&s;&s;ay, &s;igned Hi&s;toricus, written by Dr. Franklin, in which he communicated a &s;peech, &s;aid to have been delivered in the Divan of Algiers in 1687, in oppo&s;ition to the prayer of the petition of a &s;ect called <HI>Eri|ka,</HI> or puri&s;ts, for the abolition of piracy and &s;lavery. This pretended African &s;peech was an excellent parody of one delivered by Mr. Jack&s;on of Georgia. All the arguments urged in favour of negroe &s;lavery, are applied with equal force to ju&s;tify the plundering and en&s;laving the Europeans. It affords, at the &s;ame time, a demon&s;tration of the futility of
<PB N="184" REF="027004_0184_0FD2DEC932F70EE0">the arguments in defence of the &s;lave trade, and of the &s;trength of mind and ingenuity of the author, at his advanced period of life. It furni&s;hed too a no le&s;s convincing proof of his power of imitating the &s;tyle of other times and nations, than his celebrated parable again&s;t per&s;ecution. And as the latter led many to &s;earch the &s;criptures with a view to find it, &s;o the former cau&s;ed many per&s;ons to &s;earch the book-&s;tores and libraries, for the work from which it was &s;aid to be extracted.</P>
<P>In the beginning of April following, he was attacked with a fever and complaint of his brea&s;t, which terminated his exi&s;tence. The following account of his la&s;t illne&s;s was written by his friend and phy&s;ician, Dr. Jones.</P>
<P>"The &s;tone, with which he had been af|flicted for &s;everal years, had for the la&s;t twelve months confined him chiefly to his bed; and during the extreme painful parox|y&s;ms, he was obliged to take large do&s;es of laudanum to mitigate his tortures&mdash;&s;till, in the intervals of pain, he not only amu&s;ed him&s;elf with reading and conver&s;ing with his family, and a few friends who vi&s;ited him, but was often employed in doing bu&s;ine&s;s of a public as well as private nature, with vari|ous per&s;ons who waited on him for that pur|po&s;e; and in every in&s;tance di&s;played, not only that readine&s;s and di&s;po&s;ition of doing good, which was the di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|teri&s;tic of his life, but the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="027004_0185_0FD2DEF4711815B0">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his uncommon mental abilities; and not unfrequently indulged him&s;elf in tho&s;e <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit</HI> and entertaining anecdotes, which were the delight of all who heard him.</P>
<P>"About &s;ixteen days before his death, he was &s;eized with a feveri&s;h indi&s;po&s;ition, with|out any particular &s;ymptoms attending it, till the third or fourth day, when he complained of a pain in his left brea&s;t, which increa&s;ed till it became extremely acute, attended with a cough and laborious breathing. During this &s;tate, when the &s;everity of his pains &s;ome|times drew forth a groan of complaint, he would ob&s;erve&mdash;that he was afraid he did not bear them as he ought&mdash;acknowledged his grateful &s;en&s;e of the many ble&s;&s;ings he had received from that &s;upreme being, who had rai&s;ed him from &s;mall and low beginnings to &s;uch high rank and con&s;ideration among men&mdash;and made no doubt but his pre&s;ent afflicti|ons were kindly intended to wean him from a world in which he was no longer fit to act the part a&s;&s;igned him. In this frame of body and mind he continued till five days before his death, when his pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him, and his family were flattering them&s;elves with the hopes of his recovery, when an impo&s;thumation, which had formed it&s;elf in his lungs, &s;uddenly bur&s;t, and di&s;charged a great quantity of matter, which he continued to throw up while he had &s;ufficient &s;trength to do it; but, as that fail|ed, the organs of re&s;piration became gradu|ally
<PB N="186" REF="027004_0186_0FD2DECBD6D0ED58">oppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;a calm lethargic &s;tate &s;uc|ceeded&mdash;and, on the 17th of April, 1790, about eleven o'clock at night, he quietly expired, clo&s;ing a long and u&s;eful life of eighty-four years and three months.</P>
<P>"It may not be ami&s;s to add to the above account, that Dr. Franklin, in the year 1735, had a &s;evere pleuri&s;y, which terminated in an ab&s;ce&s;s of the left lobe of his lungs, and he was then almo&s;t &s;uffocated with the quan|tity and &s;uddenne&s;s of the di&s;charge. A &s;e|cond attack of a &s;imilar nature happened &s;ome years after this, from which he &s;oon recover|ed, and did not appear to &s;uffer any incon|venience in his re&s;piration from the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es."</P>
<P>The following epitaph on him&s;elf, was writ|ten by him many years previous to his death:
<Q><HI>THE BODY of</HI> BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, Printer, (Like the cover of an old book, Its contents torn out, And &s;tript of its lettering and gilding) Lies here, food for worms; Yet the work it&s;elf &s;hall not be lo&s;t, For it will (as he believed) appear once more, In a new And more beautiful edition, Corrected and amended by The AUTHOR.</Q></P>

<P>My hi&s;tory of the Academy of Sciences, in &s;ixty or &s;eventy volums quarto, I give to the philo&s;ophical &s;ociety of Philadelphia, of which I have the honour to be pre&s;ident.

<PB N="188" REF="027004_0188_0FD2DECEF2C1A318">owe my fir&s;t in&s;tructions in literature to the free grammar-&s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed there. I therefore give one hundred pounds &s;terling to my executors, to be by them, the &s;urvivors or &s;urvivor of them, paid over to the managers or directors of the free &s;chools in my native town of Bo&s;ton, to be by them, or the per|&s;on or per&s;ons who &s;hall have the &s;uperintend|ance and management of the &s;aid &s;chools, put out to intere&s;t, and &s;o continued at intere&s;t for ever; which intere&s;t annually &s;hall be laid out in &s;ilver medals, and given as honorary rewards annually by the directors of the &s;aid free &s;chools, for the encouragement of &s;chol|ar&s;hip in the &s;aid &s;chools, belonging to the &s;aid town, in &s;uch manner as to the di&s;cretion of the &s;elect men of the &s;aid town &s;hall &s;eem meet.</P>
<P>Out of the &s;alary that may remain due to me, as pre&s;ident of the &s;tate, I give the &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds to my executors, to be by them, the &s;urvivors or &s;urvivor of them, paid over to &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as the leg|i&s;lature of this &s;tate, by an act of a&s;&s;embly, &s;hall appoint to receive the &s;ame, in tru&s;t, to be employed for making the Schuylkill navi|gable.</P>
<P>During the number of years I was in bu&s;i|ne&s;s as a &s;tationer, printer, and po&s;tma&s;ter, a great many &s;mall &s;ums became due to me, for books, adverti&s;ements, po&s;tage of letters, and other matters, which were not collected, when in 1757, I was &s;ent by the a&s;&s;embly to En|gland as their agent&mdash;and, by &s;ub&s;equent ap|pointments
<PB N="189" REF="027004_0189_0FD2DEF9BB9A31A8">continued there till 1775&mdash;when, on my return, I was immediately engaged in the affairs of congre&s;s, and &s;ent to France in 1776, where I remained nine years, not re|turning till 1785; and the &s;aid debts not be|ing demanded in &s;uch a length of time, are become in a manner ob&s;olete, yet are never|thele&s;s ju&s;tly due.&mdash;The&s;e, as they are &s;ta|ted in my great folio ledger, E, I bequeath to the contributors of the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;|pital; hoping that tho&s;e debtors, and the de|&s;cendants of &s;uch as are decea&s;ed, who now, as I find, make &s;ome difficulty of &s;atisfying &s;uch antiquated demands as ju&s;t debts, may however be induced to pay or give them as charity to that excellent in&s;titution. I am &s;en&s;ible that much mu&s;t inevitably be lo&s;t; but I hope &s;omething con&s;iderable may be re|covered. It is po&s;&s;ible too that &s;ome of the parties charged may have exi&s;ting old un&s;et|tled accounts again&s;t me; in which ca&s;e the managers of the &s;aid ho&s;pital will allow and deduct the amount, and pay the balance, if they find it again&s;t me.</P>

<HEAD>CODICIL.</HEAD>
<P>I Benjamin Franklin, in the foregoing or annexed la&s;t will and te&s;tament, having fur|ther con&s;idered the &s;ame, do think proper to make and publi&s;h the following codicil, or ad|dition thereto:</P>
<P>IT having long been a fixed political opini|on of mine, that in a democratical &s;tate there ought to be no offices of profit, for the rea|&s;ons I have given in an article of my drawing in our con&s;titution, it was my intention, when I accepted the office of pre&s;ident, to devote the appointed &s;alary to &s;ome public u&s;e: ac|cordingly I had already, before I made my la&s;t will, in July la&s;t, given large &s;ums of it to colleges, &s;chools, building of churches, &amp;c. and in that will I bequeathed two thou&s;and pounds more to the &s;tate, for the purport of making the Schuylkill navigable; but under|&s;tanding &s;ince, that &s;uch a &s;um will do but little towards accompli&s;hing &s;uch a work, and that the project is not likely to be undertaken for ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs to come&mdash;and having entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dea, which I hope may be found mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ten&s;ively u&s;eful, I do hereby revoke and annul the beque&s;t and direct that the certificates I have for what re|mains due to me of that &s;alary, be &s;old to|wards rai&s;ing the &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as I am now about to order.</P>
<P>It has been an opinion, that he who re|ceives
<PB N="191" REF="027004_0191_0FD2DEFABB062F08">an e&s;tate from his ance&s;tors, is under &s;ome obligation to tran&s;mit the &s;ame to po&s;te|rity. This obligation lies not on me, who never inherited a &s;hilling from any ance&s;tor or relation. I &s;hall, however, if it is not dimi|ni&s;hed by &s;ome accident before my death, leave a con&s;iderable e&s;tate among my de&s;cend|ants and relations. The above ob&s;ervation is made merely as &s;ome apology to my family, for my making beque&s;ts that do not appear to have any immediate relation to their advan|tage.</P>
<P>I was born in Bo&s;ton, New-England, and owe my fir&s;t in&s;tructions in literature to the free grammar &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed there. I have therefore con&s;idered tho&s;e &s;chools in my will.</P>
<P>But I am under obligations to the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, for having, una&s;ked, appoint|ed me formerly their agent, with a hand&s;ome &s;alary, which continued &s;ome years: and al|though I accidently lo&s;t in their &s;ervice, by tran&s;mitting governor Hutchin&s;on's letters, much more than the amount of what they gave me, I do not think that ought in the lea&s;t to demini&s;h my gratitude. I have con|&s;idered that, among arti&s;ans, good apprenti|ces are mo&s;t likely to make good citizens; and having my&s;elf been bred to a manual art, printing, in my native town, and afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;et up my bu&s;ine&s;s in Philadelphia by kind loans of money from two friends there, which was the foundation of my for|tune,
<PB N="192" REF="027004_0192_0FD2DED1740C4B88">and of all the utility in life that may be a&s;cribed to me&mdash;I wi&s;h to be u&s;eful even after my death, if po&s;&s;ible in forming and advanc|ing other young men, that may be &s;erviceable to their country in both the&s;e towns.</P>
<P>To this end I devote two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which I give, one thou&s;and thereof to the inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and the other one thou&s;and to the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, in tru&s;t, to and for the u&s;es, intents, and pur|po&s;es, herein after mentioned and declared.</P>
<P>The &s;aid &s;um of one thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling, if accepted by the inhabitants of the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bo&s;ton, &s;hall be managed under the direction of the &s;elect men, united with the mini&s;ters of the olde&s;t epi&s;copalian, congre|grational, and pre&s;byterian churches in that town, who are to let out the &s;ame upon inter|e&s;t at five per cent. per annum, to &s;uch young married artificers, under the age of twenty-five years, as have &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in the &s;aid town, and faithfully fulfilled the duties required in their indentures, &s;o as to obtain a good moral character, from at lea&s;t two re&s;pectable citizens, who are willing to become &s;ureties in a bond, with the appli|cants, for the repayment of the money &s;o lent, with intere&s;t, according to the terms herein after pre&s;cribed; all which bonds are to be taken for Spani&s;h milled dollars, or the value thereof in current gold coin: and the manager &s;hall keep a bound book, or books,
<PB N="193" REF="027004_0193_0FD2DEFC39C58148">wherein &s;hall be entered the names of tho&s;e who &s;hall apply for, and receive the benefit of this in&s;titution, and of their &s;ureties, to|gether with the &s;ums lent, the dates, and o|ther nece&s;&s;ary and proper records re&s;pecting the bu&s;ine&s;s and concerns of this in&s;titution: and as the&s;e loans are intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t young married artificers in &s;etting up their bu&s;ine&s;s, they are to be proportioned by the di&s;cretion of the managers, &s;o as not to exceed &s;ixty pounds &s;terling to one per&s;on, nor to be le&s;s than fifteen pounds.</P>
<P>And if the number of appliers &s;o entitled &s;hould be &s;o large as that the &s;um will not &s;uf|fice to afford to each as much as might other|wi&s;e not be improper, the proportion to each &s;hall be dimini&s;hed, &s;o as to afford to every one &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e aids may there|fore be &s;mall at fir&s;t, but as the capital increa|&s;es by the accumulated intere&s;t, they will be more ample. And in order to &s;erve as many as po&s;&s;ible in their turn, as well as to make the repayment of the principals borrow more ea&s;y, each borrower &s;hall be obliged to pay with the yearly intere&s;t one tenth part of the principal; which &s;ums of principal and intere&s;t &s;o paid in, &s;hall be again let out to fre&s;h borrow|ers. And it is pre&s;umed, that there will be always found in Bo&s;ton virtuous and benevo|lent citizens, willing to be&s;tow a part of their time in doing good to the ri&s;ing generation, by &s;uperintending and managing this in&s;titu|tion gratis; it is hoped that no part of the
<PB N="194" REF="027004_0194_0FD2DED39F6C76D0">money will at any time lie dead, or be di|verted to other purpo&s;es, but be continually augmenting by the intere&s;t, in which ca&s;e there may in time be more than the occa&s;ion in Bo&s;ton &s;hall require<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and then &s;ome may be &s;pared to the neighbouring or other towns in the &s;aid &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, which may de&s;ire to have it, &s;uch towns engaging to pay punctually the intere&s;t, and &s;uch proportions of the principal annually to the inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, if this plan is execu|ted, and &s;ucceeds, as projected, without in|terruption, for one hundred years, the &s;um will be then one hundred and thirty-one thou&s;and pounds; of which I would have the managers of the donation to the town of Bo&s;t|on then lay out, at their di&s;cretion, one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds in public works, which may be judged of mo&s;t general untility to the inhabitants; &s;uch as fortifications, bridg|es, aqueducts, public buildings, baths, pave|ments, or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people, and ren|der it more agreeable to &s;trangers re&s;orting thither for health, or a temporary re&s;idence. The remaining thirty-one thou&s;and pounds I would have continued to be let out to intere&s;t, in the manner above directed, for one hundred years; as I hope it will have been found that the in&s;titution has had a good effect on the conduct of youth, and been of &s;ervice to ma|ny worthy characters and u&s;eful citizens. At the end of this &s;econd term, If no unfortu|nate accident has prevented the operation, the
<PB N="195" REF="027004_0195_0FD2DEFDB6E4FA80">&s;um will be four millions and &s;ixty-one thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling; of which I leave one million and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and pounds to the di&s;po&s;ition and management of the inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, and the three milli|ons to the di&s;po&s;ition of the government of the &s;tate; not pre&s;uming to carry my views any father.</P>
<P>All the directions herein given re&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;ition and management of the dona|tion to the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, I would have ob&s;erved re&s;pecting that to the inhabi|tants of Philadelphia; only, as Philadelphia is incorporated, I reque&s;t the corporation of that city to undertake the management, agree|able to the &s;aid directions: and I do hereby ve&s;t them with full and ample powers for that purpo&s;e. And having con&s;idered that the covering its ground-plat with buildings and pavements, which carry off mo&s;t rain, and prevent its &s;oaking into the earth, and renewing and purifying the &s;prings, whence the water of the wells mu&s;t gradually grow wor&s;e, and in time be unfit for u&s;e, as I find has happened in all old cities; I recommend, that, at the end of the fir&s;t hundred years, if not done before, the corporation of the city employ a part of the hundred thou&s;and pounds in bringing by pipes the water of Wi&s;&s;ahickon-creek into the town, &s;o as to &s;upply the inha|bitants, which I apprehend may be done without great difficulty, the level of that creek being much above that of the city,
<PB N="196" REF="027004_0196_0FD2DED683A22530">and may be made higher by a dam. I al&s;o recommend making the Schuylkill complete|ly navigable. At the end of the &s;econd hundred years, I would have the di&s;po&s;ition of the four millions and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and pounds divided between the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia and the government of Penn&s;ylvania, in the &s;ame manner as herein directed with re&s;pect to that of the inha|bitants of Bo&s;ton and the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. It is my de&s;ire that this in&s;ti|tution &s;hould take place, and begin to operate within one year after my decea&s;e; for which purpo&s;e due notice &s;hould be publicly given previous to the expiration of that year, that tho&s;e for who&s;e benefit this e&s;tabli&s;hment is intended may make their re&s;pective applicati|ons: and I hereby direct my executors, the &s;urvivors and &s;urvivor of them, within &s;ix months after my decea&s;e, to pay over the &s;aid &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall be duly appointed by the &s;elect men of Bo&s;ton, and the corporation of Philadelphia, to receive and take charge of their re&s;pective &s;ums of one thou&s;and pounds each for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid. Con&s;idering the accidents to which all human affairs and projects are &s;ubject in &s;uch a length of time, I have perhaps too much flattered my&s;elf with a vain fancy, that the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, if carri|ed into execution, will be continued without interruption, and have the effects propo&s;ed; I hope, however, that, if the inhabitants of the two cities &s;hould not think fit to under|take
<PB N="197" REF="027004_0197_0FD2DF00B5E414E0">the execution, they will at lea&s;t accept the offer of the&s;e donations, as a mark of my good will, token of my gratitude, and te&s;ti|mony of my de&s;ire to be u&s;eful to them even after my departure. I wi&s;h, indeed, that they may both undertake to endeavour the execution of my project, becau&s;e I think, that, though unfore&s;een difficulties may ari&s;e, expedients will be found to remove them, and the &s;cheme be found practicable. If one of them accepts the money with the conditions and the other refu&s;es, my will then is, that both &s;ums be given to the inhabitants of the city accepting; the whole to be applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;es, and under the &s;ame regulati|ons directed for the &s;eparate parts; and if both refu&s;e, the money remains of cour&s;e in the ma&s;s of my e&s;tate, and it is to be di&s;po&s;ed of therewith, according to my will made the &s;eventeenth day of July 1788.</P>
<P>My fine crab-tree walking-&s;tick, with a gold head curiou&s;ly wrought in the form of the cap of Liberty, I give to my friend, and the friend of mankind, General Wa&s;hington. If it were a &s;ceptre, he has merited it, and would become it.</P>
