<Q>He &s;tood in too much Awe of his great Ma&s;ter, to fear or know any Man, [in the Di&s;charge of his Duty] or to be &s;way'd by any worldly Con&s;iderations.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MEEKNESS and Patience, and a mutual Con|de&s;cen&s;ion and Forbearance towards one another, are Duties incumbent on all the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. The Example of their great Lord, as well as his Doctrine, was peculiarly calculated to inforce and recommend them, as being of eminent Note in the Chri&s;tian Scheme. And if we take a View of the State of Things in the World, and con&s;ider the incredible Mi&s;chiefs that have ari&s;en to Mankind from their Pride and Peevi&s;hne&s;s, and their in&s;ulting and domineering over one another; we &s;hall &s;oon be convinc'd, that the&s;e Duties are not only of the la&s;t Importance to the pre&s;ent Ea&s;e and Quiet of Men in the va|rious Relations and Affairs of this Life, but Rea&s;on will tell us, they cannot be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to prepare them for the Society and Happine&s;s of the future World; where there &s;hall be no|thing to hurt and de&s;troy, or to grieve and vex the ble&s;&s;ed Inha|bitants forever.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e Duties are incumbent on all Chri&s;tians, and &s;hould make a di&s;tingui&s;hing Part of their Character from the Re&s;t of Mankind; yet the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of Chri&s;t &s;hould look up|on them&s;elves as in particular call'd to excel in them. Their Relation to Chri&s;t beyond that of Chri&s;tians in common, and the Nature and Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office, <HI>viz.</HI> to teach the Re|ligion of Chri&s;t to others &s;hould be con&s;idered by them, as a perpetual Admonition to 'em to approach the neare&s;t po&s;&s;ible to the Likene&s;s of Chri&s;t, and be a Pattern them&s;elves to the Re&s;t of their Fellow-Chri&s;tians. The great Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="005332_0004_1017003F15CFEC60">who&s;e Example next to that of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, is the mo&s;t eminent of any one recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, took particular Care of his Duty in the&s;e Re&s;pects: And we are very frequently notified of it, to the End, without Doubt, that others in the &s;acred Office might be excited from thence <HI>to go and do likewi&s;e;</HI> and become Followers of this <HI>prime Mini&s;ter</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Church, as he followed Chri&s;t the <HI>Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith.</HI> Hence in the Text, after a large Ac|count, through the whole foregoing Part of the Chapter, of his Meekne&s;s and Forbearance and Conde&s;cen&s;ion towards all Sorts of Per&s;ons under the various Prejudices of their Education, and the different Turns of Mind with which they atten|ded on his Mini&s;try, the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;igns the Rea&s;on of &s;uch his Conduct: Saying, <HI>And this I do for the Go&s;pel's Sake, that I might be Partaker thereof with you;</HI> giving us to under&s;tand, he did not conde&s;cend to the Weakne&s;&s;es and Prejudices of People, to aggrandi&s;e him&s;elf in their E&s;teem, or that by little mean popular Arts he might exalt him&s;elf above his Brethren, employ'd in the &s;ame evangelical Mini&s;try: Much le&s;s did he do it, that by working on their Pa&s;&s;ions, he might obtain &s;uch a Ma&s;tery over their Under&s;tandings, as to be able to manage them to his own particular Humour, and &s;erve his worldly Ends by them: This was too much the Manner of fal&s;e Teachers; but he did it <HI>for the Go&s;pel's Sake,</HI> i. e. as he expre&s;&s;es it in &s;ome of the foregoing Ver&s;es, that he might gain and &s;ave them, <HI>viz.</HI> gain them to Chri&s;t and not to him&s;elf, and &s;ave them from the Dominion of their Lu&s;ts, and not from the due Exerci&s;e of their Rea&s;on: And that what he aim'd at with Re&s;pect to him&s;elf, was to be a Sharer of the &s;ame Benefits, and a Partaker of the Go&s;pel with them.</P>
<P>There are two Things here imply'd which I &s;hall make the Heads of the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t ought to aim at being Parta|kers of the Go&s;pel, in common with all the Faithful. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That in Order hereto, they ought to &s;et up the Go&s;pel in their View, as that for the promoting of which their Office was de&s;ign'd; and in the Reputation, Defence, Succe&s;s, and Propagation of which, all their mini&s;terial Endeavours &s;hould center.</ITEM>

I. That the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t ought to aim at being Parta|kers of the Go&s;pel in common with all the Faithful. <HI>That I might be Partaker thereof with you.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters have the &s;ame Concern and Intere&s;t in the Chri&s;ti|an Religion with the re&s;t of Mankind. They have Souls to &s;ave or lo&s;e as well as their People; their Lives are equally pre|carious and uncertain; <HI>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Fle&s;h of Bra&s;s;</HI> they have the precious Trea|&s;ure of the Go&s;pel but in <HI>Earthen Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> that are &s;oon and ea|&s;ily da&s;h'd to Pieces&mdash;And they are no more exempted from appearing in the la&s;t Judgment: <HI>They mu&s;t give Account of them|&s;elves to God</HI> as well as the re&s;t of Mankind, <HI>and receive the Things done in the Body whether they have been good or evil.</HI> They ought not then to be &s;o intent upon the &s;aving of others as to neglect their own Salvation. It &s;hould &s;eem indeed as if this was in no wi&s;e likely ever to happen. But they that know the Multiplicity of Cares and perpetual Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s in which the Mini&s;try for the mo&s;t Part involves a Man, will not think &s;uch a Caution needle&s;s. There are, 'tis true, &s;ome Ad|vantages of a religious Nature attending on an Employment in the Work of the Mini&s;try: but then the Temptations likewi&s;e peculiar to that Office, or more e&s;pecially be&s;etting tho&s;e who are employ'd in it, are in a great Mea&s;ure a Ballance to them. And if any &s;hould grow remi&s;s upon this Account, under Pre|tence that they are continually taken up in religious and &s;piri|tual Affairs, it would certainly be a great and mo&s;t dangerous Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>It is con&s;tantly found, that Mini&s;ters are Men of like Pa&s;&s;i|ons with others; and though good People are apt to conceive a more rais'd Opinion of their Sanctity than of their own, or of other Men's, yet it will not from hence follow, that Mini|&s;ters &s;hould think thus of them&s;elves: Nor can there be any Foundation for it meerly from their being employ'd in the &s;a|cred Function. This indeed &s;hould be a Motive to them to ex|cell in all Chri&s;tian Goodne&s;s and Virtue; that they may be Examples to <HI>Believers in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Spirit, in Faith, in Charity, in Purity:</HI> But then in Order hereto, per|&s;onal Religion mu&s;t be no &s;mall Part of their Care; and while they are employ'd in keeping the Vineyard for others, they mu&s;t not neglect their own. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in many Places
<PB N="8" REF="005332_0006_10170043CB9CABE8">informs us of his own daily Exerci&s;e herein; <HI>he kept under his Body, and brought it into Subjection, le&s;t that by any Means, when he had preached to others, he him&s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;t-away.</HI> He took Care to have his Conver&s;ation in the World in <HI>Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not according to fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but the Grace of God.</HI> He was <HI>willing in all Things to live hone&s;tly,</HI> and u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours <HI>to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence, both towards God and towards Man.</HI> And in the Text, to in&s;i&s;t up|on no other Place at pre&s;ent, <HI>This I do for the Go&s;pel's Sake,</HI> THAT I MIGHT BE PARTAKER THEREOF WITH YOU. This &s;hews what he had in View with Re&s;pect to him&s;elf, <HI>namely</HI> to be a Sharer with all the Faithful in the Bene|fits of the Go&s;pel, to experience its Divine Energy in changing and transforming him into the Image of Chri&s;t in this pre&s;ent World; and then in the World to come, to be a Partaker of eternal Life, which is the great and final Reward the Go&s;pel propo&s;es. Here then,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;hould aim at being Partakers of the <HI>&s;aving Efficacy</HI> of Go&s;pel-Truths. They &s;hould not content them|&s;elves with meerly teaching the Truths of the Go&s;pel to others, (though this they &s;hould do very diligently, it being a main Branch of their Office,) but in Order to their own Salvation they &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;ee to it, that they experience in them&s;elves the effectual Operation of tho&s;e Truths purifying and governing their Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>It is not teaching the Truths of the Go&s;pel, but obeying and living them, that will denominate us good Men. Whenever therefore we are preaching upon any important Subject to our People, we &s;hould, as often as may be, bring the Matter home, to our&s;elves by &s;uch &s;erious, &s;olemn Reflections as the&s;e, <Q>How am I affected, and what is my own Concern herein? What is the State of my own Soul in Reference to the&s;e Things! And what have I to do more than I have yet done in Order to a due Improvement of the&s;e Truths, that I may not be condemn'd in the la&s;t Day <HI>out of my own Mouth?</HI></Q> Oh my Brethren! It will be a dreadful Thing to have the Judge &s;ay to any of us, <HI>Thou wicked Servant, out of thine own Mouth will I condemn thee.</HI> And yet this will certainly be the Ca&s;e, be we ever &s;o diligent in <HI>teaching</HI> the Go&s;pel to others, if we are not careful to <HI>live</HI> it our &s;elves. We mu&s;t be renew'd in
<PB N="9" REF="005332_0007_101700456B1EE8F0">the Spirit of our Minds, the Knowledge of the Truth mu&s;t make us free; we mu&s;t be &s;anctified by our Faith in Chri&s;t, and be in&s;pired and animated to a Victory over the World, or it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be &s;av'd. The Want of the&s;e Things can no more di&s;pen&s;ed with in Mini&s;ters than others: Yea, but higher Attainments are requir'd, <HI>for to him that knoweth to do Good and doth it not, to him it is Sin. And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepar'd not him&s;elf, nor did ac|cording to it, &s;hall be beaten with many Stripes.</HI> This then we &s;hould continually aim at, to find in our&s;elves the powerful Ef|fect of tho&s;e Truths which we preach to our People; that ha|ving the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and being full of Goodne&s;s and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, we may appear to be his, and to have a real, &s;aving Intere&s;t in him.</P>
<P>And to encourage, excite and animate us hereto, we &s;hould al&s;o,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Aim at being Partakers of the Go&s;pel, as that Phra&s;e may &s;ignify our being Partakers of the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> which the Go&s;pel reveals.</P>
<P>It can be no more unlawful in Mini&s;ters than in private Chri|&s;tians <HI>to have a Re&s;pect to the Recompence of Reward;</HI> and to animate them&s;elves to their Duty from the Con&s;ideration of the Glory and Happine&s;s of the future World. As this is the greate&s;t that can be, <HI>what Eye had not &s;een, nor Ear heard, nor had entered into the Heart of Man,</HI> before the Go&s;pel di&s;covered it; &s;o, no Doubt, this Di&s;covery was made, that we might, from thence forward, &s;et this Glory and Happine&s;s up in our View, and earne&s;tly a&s;pire at being Partakers of it. If this had been unlawful, an infinitely wi&s;e and merciful God would ne|ver have made the Di&s;covery; becau&s;e it would have been ca&s;t|ing &s;uch a Stumbling-Block in the Way of his rea&s;onable and intelligent Creatures, as mu&s;t (unle&s;s they had acted in plain Contradiction to the Nature which he him&s;elf had given them) inevitably prove their Ruin.</P>
<P>It is certainly then not only lawful, but a Duty both in Mi|ni&s;ters and People, to aim at being Partakers of the Go&s;pel in this latter Sen&s;e, when they likewi&s;e aim at being Partakers of it in the former, i. e. to aim at Glory and Happine&s;s in the Way of Holine&s;s and Virtue. And it is only unlawful and ab&s;urd, when Men don't &s;eek, and aim, and labour after it in the
<PB N="10" REF="005332_0008_10170049A797E128">Way the Go&s;pel pre&s;cribes, but in Ways of their own Super&s;ti|tion; not by a lively, effectual Faith in the Son of God, chang|ing their Hearts, and reforming their Lives; not by Obedience to the Go&s;pel, and the Practice of that Goodne&s;s and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which it requires; but either by &s;ome or other Scheme of meer &s;peculative Notions, or by the Practice of &s;uch Things as are no where requir'd at their Hands; when Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not made the chief Corner Stone of the Building, and the Foundation of their Hope is not laid in the Merit of his Blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but they either imagine their own Doings &s;ufficient to recommend them to God, without the Benefit of the Go&s;pel-Covenant, and the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Saviour; or el&s;e, that be their Doings what they will, they are neither the nearer, nor yet the farther off from a ju&s;t and rational Hope of eternal Life.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e are dangerous Errors, and Mini&s;ters and People &s;hould equally guard again&s;t them: Either that we have no Need of the Blood of Chri&s;t to clean&s;e us from our Sins, and of his Interce&s;&s;ion to recommend our Per&s;ons and Performances to the Divine Acceptance; or el&s;e, that be our Per&s;ons and Performances what they will, whether we be Wicked or God|ly, whether we live like Chri&s;tians or live like Heathen, the Blood of Chri&s;t may be equally ours and we hope to be &s;av'd by it, ONLY IF WE TAKE CARE CONFIDENTLY TO EXPECT IT, AND BE SURE NOT TO BE IN|FLUENC'D BY IT TO LIVE ANY BETTER THAN WE SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE. We &s;hould beware, my Brethren, how by any Means we go into &s;uch Sentiments: Or, &s;o far as it &s;hall be in our Power to pre|vent it, &s;uffer any of our People to do &s;o. The former Opi|nion is entirely &s;ubver&s;ive of Chri&s;tianity; and the latter, e|ven of moral Virtue and Hone&s;ty. Infidels err the former Way, and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts generally the latter. Let us look for e|ternal Life, but look for it <HI>as a Gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord;</HI> and as a Gift which he will only be&s;tow upon them that <HI>have their Fruit unto Holine&s;s;</HI> and let the Belief and Ex|pectation hereof have a powerful, abiding Influence upon us. The more it influences us to Holine&s;s and Virtue, &s;o much the better; even if under the Influence of this Divine Hope we &s;hould purify our&s;eves, as he that calls us to Glory and Virtue, is pure; if, <HI>fora&s;much as we know that our Labour is not in
<PB N="11" REF="005332_0009_1017004DDA8959A8">vain in the Lord,</HI> we &s;hould from thence &s;eek always to abound in the Exerci&s;es of our Chri&s;tian Duty, and if, under the Re|proaches and Terrors of an evil World, we &s;hould be &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable, and undaunted, and unfainting <HI>while we look not at the Things that are &s;een and are temporal, but at the Things which are not &s;een and are eternal.</HI> In a Word, This is &s;uch a Spring and Principle both of active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience to the Will of God, as no good Man, and much le&s;s Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter can &s;pare; and we &s;hould never therefore &s;uffer it to be wre&s;ted out of our Hands. What &s;hall we do, when the Times are &s;uch (as they have more than once been, and may be again, if God &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e righteou&s;ly to permit it) that if in this Life only we had Hope, we &s;hould of all Men be mo&s;t mi&s;erable; I &s;ay, what &s;hall we do, if we have not then a <HI>Hope entering into that within the Vail, which as an An|chor of the Soul both free and &s;tedfa&s;t,</HI> may keep it &s;afe amid&s;t the Storm; and be a Means of that ble&s;&s;ed Tranquillity, as to put us out of Danger of making <HI>Shipwreck of Faith or of a good Con&s;cience?</HI> For my own Part, I &s;hall endeavour to be always firmly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this Principle: Aiming at Glory and Vir|tue, <HI>and forgetting the Things that are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e that are before, I will pre&s;s forward towards the Mark for the Prize of the high Calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> Nor will I ever be a&s;ham'd to profe&s;s my &s;elf as acting in <HI>Hope of Eternal Life which God that cannot lie, hath pro|mi&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to the other general Head propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew that in Order hereto, the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t ought to &s;et up the Go&s;pel in their View, as that for the pro|moting of which their Office was de&s;ign'd; and in the Repu|tation, Defence, Succe&s;s, and Propagation of which, all their mini&s;terial Endeavours &s;hould center.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have not only <HI>them&s;elves to &s;ave</HI> but al&s;o <HI>them that hear them:</HI> And they can't &s;ecure their own Sal|vation, unle&s;s they likewi&s;e &s;incerely endeavour the &s;aving of their Charge; which is the End of their Office, and that for which it was &s;et up in the Church. They are to be <HI>Helping</HI> of the Faith and Holine&s;s and Comfort of the People of <HI>God.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="005332_0010_1017004F5FF81118">They are to teach the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t to <HI>ob&s;erve all tho&s;e Things</HI> which he <HI>commanded;</HI> and are perpetually to admoni&s;h them that profe&s;s to believe in God, <HI>to be careful to main|tain good Works;</HI> and &s;o adorn their Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;i|on.</P>
<P>The very Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters as &s;uch, is to promote the Go&s;pel, i. e. a right Under&s;tanding and firm Belief of the Doc|trines of Chri&s;t, and a Conver&s;ation in all tho&s;e who profe&s;s the &s;ame, agreeable thereto. And next to their own Salvation this &s;hould ever lay upon their Minds, <HI>viz.</HI> promoting the Vir|tue and Happine&s;s of tho&s;e with who&s;e In&s;truction they are in|tru&s;ted: Shewing them the good and right Way, and per&s;wa|ding them to walk in it: Laying before them the Precepts and Motives of the Go&s;pel, and from Time to Time impre&s;&s;ing their Minds with a Sen&s;e of the Reality, Nearne&s;s, and infinite Importance of un&s;een, eternal Things. The making of their People good and happy, next to &s;ecuring the Favour of God, and eternal Happine&s;s for them&s;elves, &s;hould be their great Care and governing De&s;ign. Not their own &s;ecular Advantage, not their Grandeur, not their Ea&s;e, not their own Reputation or Life, &s;hould lay &s;o near their Hearts, as promoting the Know|ledge of Chri&s;t in their People, leading them to a true Faith in him, and guiding them in Paths of Virtue and true Holine&s;s to eternal Glory. For this End, and with this in their View, the &s;hould be a always ready to deny them&s;elves, and take up their Cro&s;s; <HI>not plea&s;ing them&s;elves, nor &s;eeking their own Profit, but the Profit of many that they may be &s;aved:</HI> With Prudence and Meekne&s;s in&s;tructing and per&s;wading tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, <HI>if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the Acknowledgment of the Truth.</HI> The De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel is to make Men good and happy: and this is what Mini&s;ters are to be carrying on; <HI>as Workers together under God, be&s;eeching Men not to receive his Grace in vain.</HI> And if they meet with Op|po&s;ition herein, they are not pre&s;ently to call for Fire from Heaven; but by Gentlene&s;s and Goodne&s;s, Forbearance and Long&s;uffering, &s;hould &s;eek to overcome their Lu&s;ts and Preju|dices.</P>
<P>Indeed there may be In&s;tances, and at certain Sea&s;ons they may abound, wherein, if Mini&s;ters &s;hould be more re&s;olute, they would not want the Countenance of Scripture. The great Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who in our Text and Context men|tions

Where Good may be rati|onally hoped for from Moderation, a conde&s;cending Forbear|ance, and meek and patient In&s;truction, it is, no Doubt, to be practis'd: But &s;ome Tempers are not to be wrought on or gain'd in that Way. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> therefore exhorts, <HI>of &s;ome have Compa&s;&s;ion, making a Difference; and others &s;ave with Fear, pulling them out of the Fire.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Jude 22, and 23d Ver&s;es.</NOTE> It remains then that in all the Particulars of their Conduct, the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t need that <HI>Wi&s;dom which is profitable to direct;</HI> and &s;hould daily a&s;k it of God, who has promi&s;ed to give it liberally. And what I have &s;aid is, that in general, this End is per|petually to be had in View, and is what they &s;hould make the ruling Mea&s;ure of their Conduct; <HI>promoting the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But then there are diver&s;e Things pertaining to the Go&s;|pel, which ought to be a little more di&s;tinctly con&s;idered, upon Account of the Influence they &s;hould have upon us, as,</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Reputation</HI> of the Go&s;pel. This &s;hould be un&s;peak|ably dearer to us than our own. Our own Reputation is but a little Thing and of little Worth, further than as it may ren|der us more exten&s;ively &s;erviceable in our Day and Generation. In this View of it, a good Name is very de&s;ireable. and can hardly be &s;et at too high a Rate; but in other Re&s;pects, Re|proach and Obloquy may perhaps be &s;afer for us. To be &s;ure, neither the Prai&s;e nor Di&s;prai&s;e of Men, Can be of any Con|&s;equence to us long; for we &s;hall not &s;tand or fall by their
<PB N="14" REF="005332_0012_10170054590E3328">Judgment upon the la&s;t Trial. But the Reputation of the Go&s;|pel is of the va&s;te&s;t Con&s;equence, as the Happine&s;s of Millions, even their eternal Happine&s;s, has a Dependance upon the Re|ception and Entertainment which they &s;hall give to it. The Go&s;pel is not at all likely to profit tho&s;e who have no Opinion of its Worth and Excellency: If Men take up mean, low, and contemptuous Thoughts of the Chri&s;tian Religion, they will treat it accordingly. Mini&s;ters therefore &s;hould be infi|nitely tender of doing any Thing that may turn to its Re|proach; and on the other Hand, they &s;hould neglect nothing but do every Thing in their Power, to give it Credit and In|fluence among Men. But here &s;uffer me to &s;ay, we are not to imagine as if we could do this, <HI>promote the Honour and Reputation of the Go&s;pel,</HI> by making Additions to it of our own: As if it could receive Perfection from our Imperfection. A vain De&s;ign, a mo&s;t fooli&s;h Attempt! The Go&s;pel will e|ver be mo&s;t beautiful in its own native Simplicity. When it was fir&s;t thus taught in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Times of the Church, it had wonderful Reputation and Succe&s;s. And if we would pre&s;erve to it, in any Mea&s;ure, the &s;ame honourable E&s;teem and efficacious Influence, we mu&s;t be careful to teach the <HI>Truth as it is in Je&s;us:</HI> We mu&s;t &s;trip the Religion of Chri&s;t of tho&s;e ugly and fal&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es that have been put upon it by weak or ill-minded Men: We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h from it, and put away, what is of meer human Invention: For with this corrupt Mixture, the Reputation of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t needs &s;ink, and the Defence of it be in&s;ufficient: The Addi|tion being in no wi&s;e equal to what is genuine; nor of the &s;ame Nature with it, but for the mo&s;t Part, irrational and ab|&s;urd. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was exceeding zealous again&s;t an|nexing to Chri&s;tianity the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites and Ceremonies; be|cau&s;e he knew they would marr its Beauty, and weaken its Influence with a great Part of Mankind. And the Additions that have been made to it &s;ince that Time, e&s;pecially in <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Countries, have been far from being le&s;s detrimental than tho&s;e would have been.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Defence</HI> of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be another Part of the Mini&s;ter's Care. To this Purpo&s;e the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in his E|pi&s;tles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> pre&s;cribes, that a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> or Chri&s;|tian Mini&s;ter &s;hould not only be of mode&s;t and good Behavi|our,
<PB N="15" REF="005332_0013_101700587842CD30">but one <HI>apt to teach, a Workman that needeth not to be a|&s;hamed, and able by &s;ound Doctrine to convince Gain&s;ayers; for there are many unruly and vain Talkers,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>who&s;e Mouths mu&s;t be &s;top'd, who &s;ubvert whole Hou&s;es.</HI> And is not a good Mea&s;ure of human Literature requi&s;ite hereto? Many of the <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> of Chri&s;tianity are Men of &s;ome Learning; and what a mi&s;erable, pitiful Figure will an <HI>illiterate</HI> Mini&s;ter make, &s;hould he chance to fall into &s;uch Hands! we are not born Workmen at any Thing: But mu&s;t be in&s;tructed and educat|ed to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in which we would &s;erve our Generation. And &s;hall the &s;acred Calling only co&s;t a Man no Pains to pre|pare for it? Is every Man <HI>apt to teach?</HI> Are all <HI>able to convince Gain&s;ayers?</HI> And yet I don't &s;ee but that Mini&s;ters &s;hould be furni&s;hed and qualified in the&s;e Re&s;pects in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, or el&s;e, that their very undertaking the Work mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd unlawful. Indeed it is not to be expected that all Mini&s;ters &s;hould be alike able and &s;kilful herein; but the lea&s;t that can be rea&s;onably requir'd is, that they &s;hould be Men of good natural Powers, and have had &s;ome &s;uitable Advantage for Improvement. Upon this Account, the happy Foundati|on laid by our Forefathers for the training up of Youth for the Service of the Sanctuary, can never (I think) be enough ad|mired by us their Po&s;terity: Nor &s;hall we &s;hew our &s;elves worthy of &s;uch Ance&s;tors, &s;hould we ever &s;uffer the lea&s;t Con|tempt to be ca&s;t upon our <HI>Colleges</HI> without due Re&s;entment. Every &s;incere Friend to the Religious Intere&s;ts of this Coun|try, I believe will heartily join with me in &s;aying, May the&s;e flouri&s;hing Societies &s;till flouri&s;h in good Sen&s;e and u&s;eful Learning, as well as Piety and univer&s;al Virtue; and may our Churches be &s;upplied from them with pa&s;tors that &s;hall feed them with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding, and be the Defence as well as Ornament of the Go&s;pel, as long as the Sun and Moon &s;hall endure.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s on,</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Thing that the Hearts of Mini&s;ters are to be much &s;et upon, is the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of the Go&s;pel upon tho&s;e who profe&s;s it. Alas, it is the Want of this that creates the great|e&s;t Difficulty in the Defence of Chri&s;tianity. Had the Chri|tian Religion but its due Influence upon the Hearts and Lives of its Profe&s;&s;ors, all Mankind would &s;oon acknowledge its Di|vine
<PB N="16" REF="005332_0014_1017005CA26DA110">Original and Excellency. There is nothing el&s;e wanting to render the Chri&s;tian Church <HI>the Perfection of Beauty;</HI> and to attract the Eyes, and engage the E&s;teem of the admiring Nations. Let but <HI>Zion</HI> become a <HI>Mountain of Holine&s;s,</HI> and it would &s;oon be <HI>the Joy of the whole Earth.</HI></P>
<P>This then &s;hould be the Mini&s;ter's main Care, to in&s;truct his People in the Nature, and to convince them of the Nece&s;|&s;ity of true Holine&s;s; that <HI>except a Man be born again he can|not &s;ee the Kingdom of God;</HI> that <HI>they which profe&s;s to believe in God mu&s;t be careful to maintain good Works;</HI> and that all, in the various Relations of Life, who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians are under an indi&s;pen&s;able Obligation to <HI>deny Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godlily in the World.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;peak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority: And they mu&s;t repeat the awful Cautions &s;o often found in Scripture, <HI>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: For what&s;oever a Man &s;oweth that &s;hall he al&s;o reap.&mdash; He that &s;oweth to his Fle&s;h &s;hall of the Fle&s;h reap Corruption: But he that &s;oweth to the Spirit &s;hall of the Spirit reap Life everla&s;ting.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.7, 8.</NOTE> And, <HI>let no Man deceive you,</HI> (the Holy Gho&s;t fore&s;eeing what Oppo&s;ition this Doctrine which is according to Godline&s;s, would meet with in the &s;everal Ages of the Church) <HI>he that doth Righteou&s;ne&s;s is righteous. He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.&mdash; In this the Children of God are manife&s;t and the Children of the Devil: Who&s;oever doth not Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Bro|ther.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I John 3.7, 10.</NOTE> And they mu&s;t command their People's Attention, and oblige them not to overlook &s;uch plain Pa&s;&s;ages as tho&s;e, Rom. 2.6, 7, 8. <HI>Who will render to every Man according to his Deeds: To them that by patient Continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, eternal Life.

<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould be concern'd for the <HI>Pro|pagation</HI> of the Go&s;pel, or a farther Spread of Chri&s;tian Know|ledge than it has hitherto obtian'd. It &s;hould be their Heart's De&s;ire, and their daily Prayer to God, that <HI>all Men may be &s;a|ved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth:</HI> Nor &s;hould they be wanting in any proper methods, to contribute their utmo&s;t Endeavours that <HI>the People which &s;it in Darkne&s;s, and dwell in the Region and Shadow of Death,</HI> may be favour'd with this great Light. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was in a particular Manner concern'd for this; therefore <HI>&s;trove to preach the Go&s;pel, where Chri&s;t had not been &s;o much as nam'd.</HI> Indeed the oridi|nary Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who are Officers in particular Chur|ches, are not oblig'd, or at Liberty in this Re&s;pect, as the A|po&s;tles were, who had it in their Commi&s;&s;ion to go into all the World, and to preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature: Where|as the&s;e have their particular Stations and Provinces a&s;&s;igned them. The&s;e were in Primitive Times <HI>ordain'd in every City;</HI> and their Charge was to <HI>feed the Flock of God over which the Holy Gho&s;t had made them Over&s;eers.</HI> Their Bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;o much to plant Churches, as to take Care of tho&s;e commit|ted to their particular Over&s;ight. The Apo&s;tles, and other extraordinary Per&s;ons rais'd up by God for that Purpo&s;e, were to <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> the Nations, and gather them into di&s;tinct Chri&s;ti|an Bodies: And then tho&s;e who were put in Tru&s;t, in the &s;everal Churches by them, were to maintain Chri&s;tianity where they had planted it. Not that New Churches might not un|der their Direction be formed and gather'd out of old ones, as their Numbers &s;hould increa&s;e and their Circum&s;tances call for it; this was nece&s;&s;ary even to the Maintenance of Chri&s;tian|ity where it had been planted by the Apo&s;tles; but what I would be under&s;tood arguing again&s;t, is the Practice of tho&s;e, who, though ordinary Mini&s;ters (if any at all) yet as if they were Apo&s;tles, go from Place to Place, and from Country to Country, either having no proper Charges of their own, or neglecting them, if they have any, and rambling a|bout
<PB N="18" REF="005332_0016_101700338CEEF960">in tho&s;e of other Men's, exciting Parties and Factions: Which is &s;o far from being a Means to propagate the Go&s;pel <HI>where it is not,</HI> that it has the mo&s;t direct Tendency to &s;ubvert and overthrow it <HI>where it is.</HI> We are &s;tation'd, my Brethren, in different Parts of our Lord's Harve&s;t; and we &s;hould <HI>&s;tudy to be quiet, and to do our own Ea&s;ine&s;s.</HI> We &s;hould not &s;o much as have a Mind to crowd our &s;elves into the <HI>Labours of o|ther Men;</HI> much le&s;s &s;hould we endeavour to crowd out any of our Fellow Labourers from tho&s;e Parts of the Harve&s;t which by our common Ma&s;ter, <HI>the Lord of the Harve&s;t,</HI> are a&s;&s;ign'd to them. And as we &s;hould not aim at this our &s;elves, &s;o neither &s;hould we <HI>tamely</HI> &s;ubmit to it from others, but boldly oppo&s;e and &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;i&s;t &s;uch Criminal Di&s;orders in any of our Fellow Ser|vants,&mdash; But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P>I have thus fini&s;h'd what I propos'd; and have &s;hown what Mini&s;ters &s;hould aim at both with Re&s;pect to them&s;elves and their People, <HI>namely,</HI> in one Word, to be <HI>good Men,</HI> and make <HI>them</HI> &s;uch; to under&s;tand, believe, embrace, and prac|tice the Religion of Chri&s;t, and teach it truly and &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully to others. I &s;hall only crave your Patience further, while I make &s;ome <HI>Application</HI> of what has been &s;aid, in the u&s;ual Addre&s;&s;es; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To my Fathers and Brethren in the Mini&s;try, and more particularly to the <HI>Per&s;on now to be ordained;</HI> And <HI>then,</HI> to my Chri&s;tian Hearers in general, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the <HI>Congregation in this Place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Permit me to addre&s;s, and make &s;ome Application of what has been &s;aid to my <HI>Fathers and Brethren in the Mi|ni&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>How critical is the Situation of our Place, and of what va&s;t Con&s;equence is the right Deportment and due Behaviour of our &s;elves in &s;uch important Stations! We are put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t invalu|able Trea&s;ure, and we have this to improve not for our &s;elves only, but for many others. With this in our Hands, with the&s;e <HI>Goods of our heavenly Ma&s;ter,</HI> we are to <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>occupy.</HI> And our Bu&s;ine&s;s is, not only to improve our &s;elves in the Knowledge and Love of God, and Conformity to his Image and Will, but likewi&s;e to gain <HI>others</HI> to Chri&s;t, even as many
<PB N="19" REF="005332_0017_10170065553513C0">as we can, and to promote in them the &s;ame heavenly Vir|tues. We are not to deal in Party Matters (our Lord will not have his Goods thus be&s;tow'd) in promoting Factions and Schi&s;ms, and in dividing and alienating the Minds of Men, and of Chri&s;tians from one another. We are not to deal in <HI>proud Wrath,</HI> and to &s;pend our Lord's Money in fomenting a better Zeal ari&s;ing from Men's <HI>doting about Que&s;tions and Strifes of Words;</HI> but our Bu&s;ine&s;s is, with the <HI>Words of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Doctrine which is according to Godline&s;s,</HI> to promote Faith and Love and that <HI>godly Edifying</HI> which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. We are not at Liberty to &s;pend that Time and Strength in contending with our Fellow-Servants, which is given us for other and better Purpo&s;es. We have a great Work upon our Hands; and &s;hall we let it <HI>cea&s;e while we come down</HI> beneath the Dignity of our Office, to quarrel about Trifles? Let us hear the great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> giving his &s;olemn Ad|vice to a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, <HI>Follow</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Faith, Charity, Peace with all them that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart. But fooli&s;h and unlearn'd Que&s;tions avoid, knowing that they do gender Strifes.

And here let me &s;ay, the Credit and Honour of Chri&s;tianity demand this at our Hands, and the Defence of it makes it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. And I &s;hould think the Suc|ce&s;s of it too, might be rea&s;onably hop'd to bear &s;ome good Proportion to the Purity and Simplicity in which it is taught.
<PB N="20" REF="005332_0018_101700682E88CFB0">To be &s;ure, the Go&s;pel never had &s;uch Succe&s;s as in the pri|mitive Times before the Face of it was over&s;pread with that great and general Corruption, which even the <HI>Reformation from Popery</HI> (though the greate&s;t of Ble&s;&s;ings, yet I fear) has not entirely carried off.

<P>I would now turn my &s;elf to the Per&s;on, at who&s;e De|&s;ire and for who&s;e &s;pecial Service this Di&s;cour&s;e was pre|par'd.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Sir,</HI> I doubt not but you have heard with a particular Self-Application. I have &s;aid nothing (I think) di&s;couraging; for why &s;hould it be thought an hard Saying, that we mu&s;t be plain, hone&s;t Men, and aim at what we profe&s;s to aim at, and &s;erve the Ma&s;ter we profe&s;s to have cho&s;en. You will pre&s;ently be acknowledg'd a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and receive the Charge of Souls. Your Bu&s;ine&s;s then will be, to preach Chri&s;t and watch for Souls; no Work more honourable or more important. But in Order to your doing this &s;ucce&s;sfully, <HI>the Life which you live in the Fle&s;h, you mu&s;t live by the Faith of the Son of God,</HI> depending on, and deriving from him, the Head of all vital Influences, the A&s;&s;i&s;tance you &s;hall need from Time to Time. Oh be not &s;atisfied with meerly preaching Chri&s;t, while you &s;hall allow your&s;elf to live a Stranger to him; or with watching for the Souls of others, while you neglect the keeping and the cultivating your own Soul. Preach the Go&s;pel, but live it withal; and know that in &s;o doing you &s;hall be a <HI>Partaker thereof;</HI> you &s;hall more and more ex|perience the &s;aving happy Influence of Divine Truths; the

'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that any outward Thing &s;hould be a millionth Part of that Service and Comfort to us, that the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience to the Simplicity and Integrity of our Be|haviour, will be.

But if common Chri&s;tians &s;hould aim as high as their Mini&s;ters, could any Body blame them? If they at|tain to a Prophet's Goodne&s;s, &s;hall they not receive a Prophet's Reward? Be not &s;traitn'd then, my Hearers; be not &s;trait|ned in your own Minds, for you are not &s;traitned in Chri&s;t. The Foutain of Grace is open to you; Oh drink, <HI>drink a|bundantly,</HI> and be not contented with any low Mea&s;ures of Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a melancholly Thought, the low Ebb of Chri&s;tianity in the World: how little is it under&s;tood, how little com|ply'd with? The Name indeed is common, but the Thing how rare! Oh, my Leane&s;s, my Leane&s;s, how ju&s;t and how general might the Complaint be, among all Orders indeed, a|mong all Profe&s;&s;ions, and through al the various Di&s;tinctions, that divide Mankind! Let me intreat you, my Chri&s;tian Friends, not to &s;atisfy your &s;elves with barely being &s;en&s;ible of the Evil, and bewailing it: But up and be doing, and make Proof of what Chri&s;tians may attain to. The noble&s;t Heights are attainable; ari&s;e then, be &s;trong, take hold of God's Strength, and Eternal Life is before you.</P>
<P>I now turn my &s;elf particularly to the <HI>dear People of this Pari&s;h.</HI> Through the good Hand of God towards you, a Man of Under&s;tanding, and as we hope, of &s;incere Piety, is given
<PB N="23" REF="005332_0021_1017007011C6FEB0">you this Day. Oh, magnify the Redeemer for &s;uch a Gift. Yet, though we cannot but greatly rejoice with you in the Pro&s;pect you have of &s;o happy a Settlement, we mu&s;t however warn you to <HI>cea&s;e from Man who&s;e Breath is in his No&s;trils; for wherein is he to be accounted of? Lord what is Man, Man that is like unto Vanity, and who&s;e Days are as a Shadow that pa&s;&s;eth away!</HI> And admoni&s;h you, to put your Tru&s;t <HI>in the living God, in who&s;e Hand is the Soul of every living Thing, and the Breath of all Mankind;</HI> every Creature being that, and no more as to our Comfort and Happine&s;s in it, than he is pleas'd to make it. Let it be your Care, to do nothing that &s;hall di&s;courage &s;o fervent a Zeal, or cramp &s;uch Gifts as your Mini&s;ter is &s;etting out with. We are Witne&s;&s;es of the For|wardne&s;s of his Mind towards you, and of his laudable Ambi|tion to excell. A Thou&s;and Ways you may encourage or di&s;courage him, provoke his Endeavours yet further to &s;erve you, or damp his Spirit, and &s;ink his Mind. I know the Heart of a Mini&s;ter, the Fears, Temptations and Di&s;couragements, that &s;uch are peculiarly incident to; and I know what it is in &s;ome good Mea&s;ure, to have a kind, obliging People; a People that &s;tedfa&s;tly adhere to their Mini&s;ter under all his Troubles, and don't gad about after every Stranger; who know how to bear with their Mini&s;ter's Infirmities, and are di&s;pos'd to make the be&s;t of it, if there be any good Thing in him. I can't but wi&s;h, you may be &s;uch a People, or a better to him who is this Day to be &s;et over you in the Lord. If you en|courage him you will certainly reap the Advantage of it your &s;elves. No Man can do under &s;inking Oppre&s;&s;ions, as if a People were kind to him. And if &s;ome find Fault (as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, where there are &s;o many dif|fering Minds) why may not others commend? I don't mean that it is de&s;ireable, there &s;hould be differing Sentiments among the &s;ame People. So far as it may be, <HI>they &s;hould all &s;peak the &s;ame Thing, and be perfectly join'd together in the &s;ame Mind, and in the &s;ame Judgment.</HI> But as this is not to be expected unle&s;s we under&s;tand it (perhaps as we ought to do) only of an Agreement in Fundamentals; &s;o in other and le&s;&s;er Matters, there &s;hould be a mutual Chri&s;tian Forbearance one of another. And if every one is not pleas'd in every little Thing, or Mode, or Circum&s;tance of the Mini&s;ter's Behaviour, or Preaching, or the like, who can help it? What di&s;gu&s;ts &s;ome, may be edi|fying
<PB N="24" REF="005332_0022_1017007438ADB078">to others: and if &s;ome find Fault (I &s;ay) others may commend. Not again, that I would have you to flatter your Mini&s;ter; nothing is more unprofitable, nothing more dange|rous. But that there may be an <HI>Equality,</HI> and his Spirit not &s;ink under the Captiou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e, who will never be ea&s;y long with any Mini&s;ter, or under any Preaching. My Chri&s;|tian Friends, I hope you don't look for Perfection in your Mi|ni&s;ter. Let it be his Care to be as perfect as he can, and yours to maintain that Charity who&s;e Property it is to <HI>cover a Multitude of Faults.</HI> Be more concern'd about your own Duty than his; be more concern'd to know your &s;elves how to <HI>live,</HI> than to teach him how to <HI>preach.</HI> And on the other Hand, never &s;atisfy your &s;elves with meerly admiring and ap|plauding his Preaching. Oh, empty, vain Thing, unprofitable to Mini&s;ter and People! Commend your Mini&s;ter's Preaching by improving under it in Knowledge and Virtue, by leading &s;o|ber, righteous, and godly Lives; this will afford the greate&s;t Sa|tisfaction both to him and you. Let your Profiting then, as well as his, appear to all Men; and therefore give Attendance to Reading, to Meditation and Prayer in your Families and Clo&s;ets, as well as to the publick Hearing of the Word; and be much in the&s;e Things. Oh, let the Word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly, and aim at being Partakers of the Go&s;pel. Set the Glory and Happine&s;s of the future World continually in your View; live in a realizing &s;incere Belief and Expectation of the <HI>Judgment to come;</HI> and know, that in Order to your being found in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in that Day without Spot and blamele&s;s, you mu&s;t here in this World love his Name and be his Ser|vants; you mu&s;t &s;tudy and obey his holy Will; you mu&s;t &s;in|cerely endeavour to find out the Truth for your &s;elves, and live in all good Con&s;cience before God; exerci&s;ing a daily Repen|tance for your daily, manifold Infirmities, and a lively continual Faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, who loved us and gave him&s;elf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a &s;weet &s;melling Savour:</HI>&mdash; To whom therefore, with the Father and Holy Spirit, be given Prai&s;es e|verla&s;ting, Amen.</P>

<HEAD>THE Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip By Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> of <HI>Bradford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Brethren of this A&s;&s;embly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHatever was originally intended by the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP, this Ceremony, as practi&s;ed in the&s;e Chur|ches, is an Acknowledgment of the Validity of their Ordination to whom it is given, of their Equality as Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and mutual Obligations to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in managing the Concerns and promoting the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t their common Lord.</P>
<P>It admini&s;ters therefore In&s;truction and Con&s;olation to him that receives it. <HI>On the one hand,</HI> it admoni&s;heth him to mag|nify his Office and maintain his Equality among&s;t his Brethren in the Mini&s;try again&s;t the injurious Claims of any affecting a Superiority which Chri&s;t never gave <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 20.20, &mdash; 28.</NOTE>. And <HI>on the other,</HI> it teacheth him to guard again&s;t that Ambition, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or whatever el&s;e it may be, whereby he may be prompted to exer|ci&s;e a forbidden Dominion over his Equals in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005332_0027_1017008017234378">
And as it &s;ucceeds to a Charge the mo&s;t Important that Man can be intru&s;ted with, and of which an Account mu&s;t be ren|dred in <HI>that Day,</HI> when Je&s;us &s;hall appear in the Glory of the Father with all the holy Angels to judge the quick and the dead, it may be con&s;idered as de&s;ign'd to encourage the Heart and &s;trengthen the Hands of him that receives it, who if he be duely &s;en&s;ible of the Nature of his Office cannot but need it. And this it doth, as it is a Promi&s;e of brotherly Love and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Wherefore, dear Sir, by giving you this Right Hand of Fel|low&s;hip in the Name of your Brethren in the Mini&s;try, and by the Appointment of the venerable Council convened upon the &s;olemn Occa&s;ions of this Day, I acknowledge you to be regular|ly &s;eparated to that Office which I &s;u&s;tain in the Chri&s;tian Church. And I admoni&s;h you that you and I are equal, and that neither of us is upon any Occa&s;ion what&s;oever, to a&s;pire at that <HI>Dominion</HI> and Authority which Chri&s;t hath forbidden us both; no, not yet to &s;uffer it each other.&mdash;May God ever|more grant as much of that humble heavenly Temper of Mind, whereby we may be re&s;trained within the Limits of our Duty, and on the other Hand, that Wi&s;dom and Fortitude by which the Preten&s;ions of every bold Invader of the Rights of his Bre|thren and Fellow-Servants may be &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And as I am &s;ure the weighty Charge this Day devolved upon you and repeated to me, tends to in&s;pire us with great Fear and Sollicitude of Spirit, let us, my Brother encourage our&s;elves with the &s;upports Chri&s;t hath provided for us which are many and mighty. We are engaged in a Calling that is divine, and are Workers together with God: The holy Spirit, the Sanctifier and the Comforter, operates in us and with us in the &s;ame great Undertaking: The holy Angels are oftentimes &s;ent forth up|on the like weighty Errand of mini&s;tring to tho&s;e who &s;hall be the Heirs of Salvation: Good Men too are with us in our Work by their fervent Prayers, &s;ea&s;onable Coun&s;els, and the per&s;ua&s;ive Argument of a good Example: Finally, To tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who &s;hall be faithful to the Death, Chri&s;t hath gi|ven the encouraging Promi&s;e of a Crown of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="005332_0028_1017008595B7B910">
To all which, dear Sir, I add, your Brethren, engaged in the &s;ame holy Calling, willingly promi&s;e, what in their Turn they expect from you all nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance by their Prayers, Coun&s;els, Admonitions and Reproofs, and the Exerci&s;e of their mini&s;terial Powers.</P>
<P>And now, may God of the Riches of his Grace grant you to acquit your Self in your &s;everal Functions with Indu&s;try, Fide|lity and Succe&s;s, that hereafter you may receive that tran&s;port|ing Sentence from the Judge of all the Earth, <HI>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou ha&s;t been faithful in a few things, I will make the Ruler own many things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
