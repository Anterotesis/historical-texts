</LIST>
<P N="1">I. 1. We may, in the fir&s;t place, ob&s;erve a few particulars of his life and death. He was born at <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>December,</HI> 1714, and put to a Gram|mar-&s;chool there, when about twelve years old. When he was &s;eventeen he began to be &s;eriou&s;ly reli|gious, and &s;erved GOD to the be&s;t of his knowledge. A|bout eighteen he removed to the Univer&s;ity, and was admitted at <HI>Pembroke</HI>-college in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and about a year after, he became acquainted with the <HI>Me|thodi&s;ts</HI> (&s;o called) whom from that time he loved as his own &s;oul.</P>
<P N="2">2. By them he was convinced, That we <HI>mu&s;t be born again,</HI> or outward religion will profit us no|thing. He joined with them in fa&s;ting on <HI>Wedne&s;|days</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> in vi&s;iting the &s;ick and the pri&s;o|ners, and in gathering up the very fragments of time, that no moment might be lo&s;t; and he chang|ed the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, reading chiefly &s;uch books as entered into the heart of Religion, and led directly to an experimental knowledge of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and him crucified.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was &s;oon tried as with fire. Not only his
<PB N="5" REF="012280_0003_0F8A8A268B5CB4E8">reputation was lo&s;t, and &s;ome of his be&s;t friends for|&s;ook him, but he had many inward trials. Many nights he lay &s;leeple&s;s upon his bed; many days pro|&s;trate on the ground. But after he had groaned &s;e|veral months under the <HI>&s;pirit of bondage,</HI> GOD was plea&s;ed to remove the heavy load, by giving him <HI>the &s;pirit of adoption,</HI> enabling him, through a liv|ing faith, to lay hold on <HI>the Son of his love.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. However, it was thought needful, for the re|covery of his health, which was much impaired, that he &s;hould go into the country. He accordingly went to <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> where GOD enabled him to a|waken &s;everal young per&s;ons. The&s;e &s;oon formed them&s;elves into a little &s;ociety, and were &s;ome of the fir&s;t fruits of his labour. Shortly after he began to read twice or thrice a week to &s;ome poor people in the town, and every day to read and to pray with the pri&s;oners in the county goal.</P>
<P N="5">5. Being now about twenty-one years of age, he was &s;olicited to enter into holy Orders. Of this he was greatly afraid, being deeply &s;en&s;ible of his own in&s;ufficiency. But the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf &s;ending for him, and telling him, <Q>Tho' I had purpo&s;ed to ordain none under three and twenty, yet I will ordain <HI>you</HI> whenever you come;</Q> and &s;everal o|ther providental circum&s;tances concurring, he &s;ub|mitted, and was ordained on <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> 1736. The next <HI>Sunday</HI> he preached to a crowded audito|ry, in the church wherein he was baptized. The week following he returned to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and took his Bachelor's degree. And he was now fully omploy|ed, the care of the pri&s;oners and the poor, lying chiefly on him.</P>
<P N="6">6. But it was not long before he was invited to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;erve the cure of a friend going into the
<PB N="6" REF="012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8">country. He continued there two months, lodging in the <HI>Tower,</HI> reading prayers in the chapel twice a week, catechizing and preaching once, be&s;ides daily vi&s;iting the &s;oldiers in the barracks and the infirma|ry. He al&s;o read prayers every evening at <HI>Wapping</HI> chapel, and preached at <HI>Ludgate</HI>-pri&s;on every <HI>Tue&s;|day.</HI> While he was here, letters came from his friends in <HI>Georgia,</HI> which made him long to go and help them. But not &s;eeing his call clear, at the appointed time he returned to his little charge at <HI>Oxford;</HI> where &s;e|veral youths met daily at his room, to <HI>build up each other in their mo&s;t holy faith.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. But he was quickly called from hence again, to &s;upply the cure of <HI>Dummer</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> Here he read Prayers twice a day, early in the morning and in the evening, after the people came from work. He al&s;o daily catechized the children, and vi&s;ited from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. He now divided the day into three parts, alloting eight hours for &s;leep and meals, eight for &s;tudy and retirement, and eight for reading pray|ers, catechizing, and vi&s;iting the people.&mdash;Is there a more excellent way for a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t and his church? If not, Who will not <HI>go and do likewi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Yet his mind &s;till ran on going abroad. And being now fully convinced he was called of GOD thereto, he &s;et all things in order, and in <HI>January</HI> 1737, went down to take leave of his friends in <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI> It was in this journey that GOD began to ble&s;s his mini&s;try in an uncommon manner. Wherever he preached, amazing multitudes of hearers flocked toge|ther, in <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Stonehou&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;o that the heat of the churches was &s;carce &s;upport|able. And the impre&s;&s;ions made on the minds of many, were no le&s;s extraordinary. After his return to <HI>London,</HI> while he was detained by general <HI>Ogle|thorpe,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8">from week to week, and from month to month, it plea&s;ed GOD to ble&s;s his word &s;till more. And he was indefatigable in his labour: generally on <HI>Sunday</HI> he preached four times to exceeding large auditories; be&s;ides reading prayers twice or thrice, and walking to and fro ten or twelve miles.</P>
<P N="9">9. On <HI>December</HI> 28 he left <HI>London.</HI> It was on the 29th that he fir&s;t preached without notes. <HI>December</HI> 30 he went on board; but it was above a month be|fore they cleared the land. One happy effect of their very &s;low pa&s;&s;age, he mentions in <HI>April</HI> follow|ing: <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, we now live very comfort|ably in the great cabbin. We talk of little el&s;e but GOD and CHRIST: And &s;carce a word is heard among us when together, but what has re|ference to our fall in the fir&s;t, and our new birth in the &s;econd <HI>Adam.</HI></Q> It &s;eems likewi&s;e to have been a peculiar Providence, that he &s;hould &s;pend a little time at <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> where both citizens and &s;oldiers, high and low, young and old, acknowledged the day of their vi&s;itation.</P>
<P N="10">10. From <HI>Sunday, May</HI> 7, 1738, till the latter end of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, he <HI>made full proof of his mi|ni&s;try</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> particularly at <HI>Savannah:</HI> He read prayers and expounded twice a day, and vi&s;ited the &s;ick daily. On <HI>Sunday</HI> he expounded at five in the morning; at ten read prayers and preached, and at three in the afternoon: And at &s;even in the evening expounded the church catechi&s;m. How much ea&s;i|er is it for our brethren in the mini&s;try, either in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> to find fault with &s;uch a labourer in our Lord's vineyard, than to tread in his &s;teps?</P>
<P N="11">11. It was now that he ob&s;erved the deplorable condition of many children here; and that GOD put
<PB N="8" REF="012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8">into his heart the fir&s;t thought of &s;ounding an <HI>Or|phan-Hou&s;e:</HI> for which he determined to rai&s;e con|tributions in <HI>England,</HI> if GOD &s;hould give him a &s;afe return thither. In <HI>December</HI> following he did re|turn to <HI>London:</HI> and on <HI>Sunday, January</HI> the 14th, 1739, he was ordained Prie&s;t, at <HI>Chri&s;t-Church, Ox|ford.</HI> The next day he came to <HI>London</HI> again: and on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 21&s;t preached twice. But though the churches were large, and crowded exceedingly, yet many hundreds &s;tood in the church-yard, and hun|dreds more returned home. This put him upon the fir&s;t thought of preaching in the open air. But when he mentioned it to &s;ome of his friends, they judged it to be mere madne&s;s. So he did not carry it into execution, till after he had left <HI>London.</HI> It was on <HI>Wedne&s;day, February</HI> 21, that finding all the church|doors to be &s;hut in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> (be&s;ide that no church was able to contain one half of the congregation) at three in the afternoon he went to <HI>Kingswood,</HI> and preached abroad, to near two thou&s;and people. On <HI>Friday</HI> he preached there to four or five thou&s;and; and on <HI>Sunday</HI> to (it was &s;uppo&s;ed) ten thou&s;and. The number continually increa&s;ed all the time he &s;taid at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> And a flame of holy love was kin|dled, which will not ea&s;ily be put out. The &s;ame was afterwards kindled in various parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> Indeed where|ever he went, <HI>GOD</HI> abundantly confirmed the word of his me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P N="12">12. On <HI>Sunday April</HI> 29, he preached the fir&s;t time in <HI>Moorfields,</HI> and on <HI>Kennington</HI> common, and the thou&s;ands of hearers were as quiet as they could have been in a church. Being again detained in <HI>Eng|land</HI> from month to month, he made little excur&s;ions into &s;everal counties, and received the contributions
<PB N="9" REF="012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8">of willing multitudes, for an <HI>Orphan-hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Geor|gia.</HI> The embargo which was now laid on the &s;hip|ping, gave him lei&s;ure for the more journies, through various parts of <HI>England,</HI> for which many will have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God to all eternity. At length on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 14th he embarked, but he did not land in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> till <HI>October</HI> 30. Afterwards he went through <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> the <HI>Jer&s;ies, New-York, Mary|land, Virginia, North</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> preach|ing all along to immen&s;e congregations, with full as great effect as in <HI>England.</HI> On <HI>January</HI> 10, 1740, he arrived at <HI>Savannah.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>January</HI> 29, he added three de&s;olate orphans to near twenty which he had in his hou&s;e before. The next day he laid out the ground for the hou&s;e, about ten miles from <HI>Savannah. February</HI> 11, he took in four Orphans more, and &s;et out for <HI>Frederi|ca,</HI> in order to fetch the orhans that were in the &s;outhern parts of the colony. In his return he fixt a &s;chool, both for children and grown per&s;ons, at <HI>Darien,</HI> and took four orphans thence. <HI>March</HI> 25, he laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of the <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e,</HI> to which, with great propriety, he gave the name of <HI>Bethe&s;|da;</HI> a work for which the children yet unborn &s;hall prai&s;e the LORD. He had now about forty orphans, &s;o that there were near an hundred mouths to be fed daily. But he was <HI>careful for nothing,</HI> ca&s;ting his care on HIM who <HI>feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. In <HI>April</HI> he made another tour through <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> the <HI>Jer&s;ies,</HI> and <HI>New-York.</HI> Incredible multitudes flocked to hear him, among whom were abundance of negroes. In all places the greater part of the hearers were affected to an amazing de|gree. Many were deeply convinced of their lo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70">&s;tate; many truly converted to <HI>GOD.</HI> In &s;ome pla|ces thou&s;ands cried out aloud; many as in the agonies of death; mo&s;t were drowned in tears; &s;ome turn|ed pale as death; others were wringing their hands; others lying on the ground; others &s;inking into the arms of their friends; almo&s;t all lifting up their eyes, and calling for mercy.</P>
<P N="15">15. He return'd to <HI>Savannah June</HI> 5. The next evening, during the public &s;ervice, the whole con|gregation, young and old, were di&s;&s;olved in tears; after &s;ervice, &s;everal of the pari&s;hioners, and all his family, particularly the young children, returned home crying along the &s;treet, and &s;ome could not help praying aloud. The groans and cries of the children continued all night, and great part of the next day.</P>
<P N="16">16. In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> he &s;et out again, and through vari|ous provinces came to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> While he was here, and in the neighbouring places, he was extremely weak in body. Yet the multitudes of hearers were &s;o great, and the effects wrought on them &s;o a&s;to|ni&s;hing, as the olde&s;t men then alive in the town had never &s;een before. The &s;ame power attended his preaching at <HI>New-York;</HI> particularly on <HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2, almo&s;t as &s;oon as he began, crying, weeping, and wailing, were to be heard on every &s;ide. Many &s;unk down to the ground, cut to the heart; and many were filled with divine con&s;olation. Toward the clo&s;e of this journey he made this re|flection: <Q>It is the &s;eventy-fifth day &s;ince I arrived at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> exceeding weak in body. Yet <HI>GOD</HI> has enabled me to preach an hundred and &s;eventy-five times in public, be&s;ides exhorting fre|quently in private. Never did <HI>GOD</HI> vouch&s;afe me greater comforts: Never did I perform my jour|nies
<PB N="11" REF="012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70">with le&s;s fatigue, or &s;ee &s;uch a continuance of the divine pre&s;ence in the congregations to whom I preached.</Q> In <HI>December</HI> he returned to <HI>Sa|vannah,</HI> and in the <HI>March</HI> following arrived in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. You may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that the preceding account is chiefly extracted from his own Journals, which, for their artle&s;s and unaffected &s;implicity, may vie with any writings of the kind. And how exact a &s;pecimen is this of his labours both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> for the honour of his beloved Ma&s;ter, du|ring the thirty years that followed! As well as of the uninterrupted &s;hower of ble&s;&s;ings wherewith GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;ucceed his labours! Is it not much to be lamented, that any thing &s;hould have prevented his continuing this account, till at lea&s;t, near the time when he was called by his, <HI>LORD</HI> to enjoy the fruit of his labour?&mdash;If he has left any papers of this kind, and his friends count me worthy of the honour, it would be my glory and joy to me|thodize, tran&s;cribe, and prepare them for the pub|lic view.</P>
<P N="18">18. A particular account of the la&s;t &s;cene of his life, is thus given by a gentleman of <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> <Q>Af|ter being about a month with us in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and its vicinity, and preaching every day, he went to <HI>Old-York,</HI> preached on <HI>Thur&s;day, September</HI> 27, there; proceeded to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and preached there on <HI>Friday.</HI> On <HI>Saturday</HI> morning he &s;et out for <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> but before he came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> where he had engaged to preach the next morn|ing, he was importuned to preach by the way. The hou&s;e not being large enough to contain the people, he preached in the open field. But ha|ving been infirm for &s;everal weeks, this &s;o exhau&s;t|ed
<PB N="12" REF="012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190">his &s;trength, that when he came to <HI>Newbury</HI> he could not get out of the ferry-boat without the help of two men. In the evening, however, he recovered his &s;pirits, and appeared with his u|&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s. He went to his chamber at nine, his fixt time, which no company could di|vert him from; and &s;lept better than he had done for &s;ome weeks before. He ro&s;e at four in the morning, <HI>September</HI> 30, and went into his clo&s;et; and his companion ob&s;erved he was unu&s;ually long in private. He left his clo&s;et, returned to his companion, threw him&s;elf on the bed, and lay a|bout ten minutes. Then he fell upon his knees, and prayed mo&s;t fervently to GOD, That if it was con&s;i&s;tant with his will, he might that day fini&s;h his Ma&s;ter's work." He then de&s;ired his man to call Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> the clergyman at who&s;e hou&s;e he was: But in a minute, before Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> could reach him, died without a &s;igh or groan. On the news of his death, &s;ix gentlemen &s;et out for <HI>New|bury,</HI> in order to bring his remains hither, but he could not be moved, &s;o that his precious a&s;hes mu&s;t remain at <HI>Newbury.</HI> Hundreds would have gone from this town to attend his funeral, had they not expected he would have been interred here.&mdash;May this &s;troke be &s;anctified to the church of GOD in general, and to this province in parti|cular!</Q></P>
<P N="1">II. 1. We are in the &s;econd place, to take &s;ome view of his character. A little &s;ketch of this, was &s;oon publi&s;hed in the <HI>Bo&s;ton Gazette:</HI> An extract of which is &s;ubjoined: <Q>Little can be &s;aid of him, but what every friend to vital Chri&s;tianity, who has &s;at under his mini&s;try, will atte&s;t. In his pub|lic labours he has for many years a&s;toni&s;hed the
<PB N="13" REF="012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190">world with his eloquence and devotion. With what divine pathos did he per&s;uade the impeni|tent &s;inner to embrace the practice of piety and virtue! Filled with the &s;pirit of grace, he &s;poke from the heart, and with fervency of zeal, per|haps unequalled &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles, a|dorned the truths he delivered with the mo&s;t graceful charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the command of an ever-crowded auditory. Nor was he le&s;s agreeable and in&s;tructive in his private conver&s;ation: Happy in a remarkable ea&s;e of addre&s;s; willing to com|municate, &s;tudious to edify. May the ri&s;ing ge|neration catch a &s;park of that flame which &s;hone with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre in the &s;pirit and practice of this faithful &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high GOD!</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. A more particular, and equally ju&s;t character of him, has appeared in one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> papers. It may not be di&s;agreeable to you, to add the &s;ub|&s;tance of this likewi&s;e: <Q>The character of this tru|ly pious per&s;on, mu&s;t be deeply impre&s;t on the heart of every friend of vital religion. In &s;pite of a tender and delicate con&s;titution, he continued, to the la&s;t day of his life, preaching with a fre|quency and a fervor that &s;eemed to exceed the natural &s;trength of the mo&s;t robu&s;t. Being called to the exerci&s;e of his function at an age, when mo&s;t young men are only beginning to qualify them&s;elves for it, he had not time to make a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the learned languages. But this defect was amply &s;upplied, by a lively and fertile genius, by fervent zeal, and by a forcible and mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive delivery. And though in the pulpit he often found it needful, by <HI>the terrors of
<PB N="14" REF="012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0">the Lord to per&s;uade men,</HI> he had nothing gloom in his nature, being &s;ingularly cheerful, as well as charitable and tender hearted. He was as read to relieve the bodily as the &s;piritual nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e that applied to him. It ought al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that he con&s;tantly enforced upon his audience, every duty, particularly indu&s;try in their &s;everal callings, and obedience to the &s;uperiors. He endeavoured, by the mo&s;t extra|ordinary efforts of preaching in different place and even in the open fields, to rou&s;e the lower <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of people, from the la&s;t degree of inattention and ignorance, to a &s;en&s;e of religion. For this and his other labours, the name of <HI>George Whitefield</HI> will long be remembered with e&s;teem and venera|tion.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. That both the&s;e accounts are ju&s;t and imparti|al, will readily be allowed; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> as far as they go. But they go little farther than the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> his character. They &s;hew you the <HI>Preacher,</HI> but not the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> the <HI>Saint</HI> of GOD. May I be permitted to add a little on this head, from per&s;onal knowledge of near forty years? Indeed, I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible how difficult it is to &s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o delicate a &s;ubject; what prudence is required to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">|void both extremes, to &s;ay neither too little, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> too much? Nay, I know it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak all, to &s;ay either le&s;s or more, without incurring from &s;ome the former, from others the latter cen&s;ure. Some will &s;eriou&s;ly think, that too little is &s;aid; and others that it is too much. But without attending to this, I will &s;peak ju&s;t what I know, before Him to whom we are all to give an account.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mention has already been made of his unp|aralleled <HI>Zeal,</HI> his indefatigable <HI>Activity,</HI> his <HI>Tender</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0"><HI>heartedne&s;s</HI> to the afflicted, and <HI>Charitablene&s;s</HI> to|ward the poor. But &s;hould we not likewi&s;e men|tion his deep <HI>Gratitude,</HI> to all whom GOD had u&s;|ed as in&s;truments of good to him? Of whom he did not cea&s;e to &s;peak in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, even to his dying day. Should we not mention, that he had an heart &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t gener|ous and the mo&s;t tender <HI>Friend&s;hip?</HI> I have frequent|ly thought, that this, of all others, was the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing part of his character. How few have we known of &s;o kind a temper, of &s;uch large and flow|ing affections? was it not principally by this, that the hearts of others were &s;o &s;trangely drawn and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love? This &s;hone in his very countenance, and continually breathed in all his words, whether in public or pri|vate. Was it not this, which, quick and penetrat|ing as lightning, flew from heart to heart? Which gave that life to his Sermons, his Conver&s;ations, his Letters? Ye are witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. But away with the vile mi&s;con&s;truction of men of corrupt minds, who know of no love but what is <HI>Earthly and &s;en&s;ual.</HI> Be it remembered, at the &s;ame time, that he was endued with the mo&s;t nice and un|blemi&s;hed <HI>mode&s;ty.</HI> His office called him to conver&s;e very frequently and largely, with women as well as men; and tho&s;e of every age and condition. But his whole behaviour toward them, was a practical momment on that advice of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy, In|treat the elder women as mothers, the younger as &s;i&s;|ters, with all purity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Mean time, how &s;uitable to the friendline&s;s of his &s;pirit, was the <HI>frankne&s;s</HI> and <HI>openne&s;s</HI> of his con|ver&s;ation? Although it was as far removed from rudene&s;s on the one hand, as from guile and di&s;gui&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0">on the other. Was not this frankne&s;s at once a fruit and a proof of his <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>intrepidity?</HI> Armed with the&s;e, he feared not the faces of men, but <HI>u&s;ed great plainne&s;s of &s;peech</HI> to per&s;ons of every rank and condition, high and low, rich and poor: en|deavouring only <HI>by manife&s;tation of the truth,</HI> to <HI>commend him&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Neither was he afraid of labour or pain, any more than of <HI>what man could do unto him,</HI> being equally
<Q>"<HI>Patient</HI> in bearing ill and doing well."</Q></P>
<P>And this appeared in the <HI>readine&s;s</HI> wherewith has pur&s;ued whatever he undertook for his Ma&s;ter's &s;ake. Witne&s;s one in&s;tance for all, the <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> which he began and perfected, in &s;pite of all di&s;couragements. Indeed, in whatever concerned him&s;elf, he was pliant and flexible. In this ca&s;e he was <HI>ea&s;y to be intreated,</HI> ea&s;y to be ei|ther commenced or pre&s;uaded. But he was immove|able in the things of GOD, or wherever his con&s;cience was concerned. None could per&s;uade, any more than affright him, to vary in the lea&s;t point from that <HI>integrity,</HI> which was in&s;eparable from his whole character, and regulated all his words and actions Herein he did
<Q><L>"Stand as an iron pillar &s;trong,</L>
<L>"And &s;tedfa&s;t as a wall of bra&s;s."</L></Q></P>
<P N="8">8. If it be required, What was the foundation of this integrity, or of his &s;incerity, courage, patience and every other valuable and amiable quality, it is ea&s;y to give the an&s;wer. It was not the excellence of his natural temper: Not the &s;trength of his un|der&s;tanding: It was not the force of his education
<PB N="17" REF="012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0">no, nor the advice of his friends. It was no other than faith in a bleeding LORD; <HI>Faith of the opera|tion of God.</HI> It was <HI>a lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away.</HI> It was <HI>the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, which was given unto him,</HI> filling his &s;oul with tender, di&s;intere&s;ted love to every child of man. From this &s;ource aro&s;e that torrent of <HI>Elo|quence</HI> which frequently bore down all before it: From this, that a&s;toni&s;hing force of <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> which the mo&s;t hardened &s;inners could not re&s;i&s;t. This it was, which often made his <HI>head as waters,</HI> and his eyes <HI>a fountain of tears.</HI> This it was which enabled him to pour out his &s;oul in <HI>Prayer,</HI> in a manner pe|culiar to him&s;elf, with &s;uch fullne&s;s and ea&s;e united together, with &s;uch &s;trength and variety both of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="9">9. I may clo&s;e this head with ob&s;erving, What an honour it plea&s;ed GOD to put upon his faithful &s;ervant, by allowing him to declare his everla&s;ting go&s;pel in &s;o many various countries, to &s;uch num|bers of people, and with &s;o great an effect on &s;o many of their precious &s;ouls! Have we read or heard of any per&s;on &s;ince the apo&s;tles, who te&s;tified the go&s;pel of the grace of GOD, through &s;o widely ex|tended a &s;pace, through &s;o large a part of the habi|table world? Have we read or heard of any per&s;on, who called &s;o many thou&s;ands, &s;o many miriads of &s;inners to repentance? Above all, have we read or heard of any, who has been a ble&s;&s;ed in&s;trument in his hand of <HI>bringing</HI> &s;o many &s;inners from <HI>darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of a &s;atan unto God?</HI> It is true, were we to talk thus to the gay world, we &s;hould be judged to <HI>&s;peak as barbarians.</HI> But you under&s;tand the language of the country to which
<PB N="18" REF="012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28">you are going, and whither our dear friend is gone a little before us.</P>
<P N="3">III. But how &s;hall we improve this awful provi|dence? This is the <HI>Third</HI> thing which we have to con&s;ider. And the an&s;wer to this important que&s;ti|on is ea&s;y; (may GOD write it in all our hearts!) By keeping clo&s;e to the <HI>grand doctrines</HI> which he delivered: And by drinking into his <HI>&s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, let us keep clo&s;e to the grand &s;crip|tural doctrines, which he every where delivered. There are many doctrines of a le&s;s e&s;&s;ential nature, with regard to which, even the &s;incere children of GOD (&s;uch is the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s of human un|der&s;tanding!) are and have been divided for many ages. In the&s;e we may think and let think; we may "agree to di&s;agree." But mean time let us hold fa&s;t the e&s;&s;entials <HI>of the faith, which was once delivered to the &s;aints;</HI> and which this champion of GOD &s;o &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on, at all times, and in all places.</P>
<P N="2">2. His fundamental point was, give GOD all the glory of whatever is good in man. And in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of &s;alvation, &s;et CHRIST as high, and man as low as po&s;&s;ible. With this point, he and his friends at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the original <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> (&s;o called) &s;et out. Their grand principal was, there is <HI>no power</HI> (by na|ture) and <HI>no merit</HI> in man. They in&s;i&s;ted, All pow|er to think, &s;peak, or act right, is in and from the Spirit of CHRIST; And all merit is (not in man, how high &s;oever in grace, but merely) in the blood of CHRIST. So he and they taught: There is no power in man, till it is given from above, to do one good work, to &s;peak one good word, or to form one good de&s;ire. For it is not enough to &s;ay, all men are <HI>&s;ick of &s;in:</HI> No, we are all <HI>Dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and
<PB N="19" REF="012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28">&s;ins.</HI> It follows, that all the children of men are <HI>by nature children of wrath.</HI> We are all <HI>guilty be|fore God,</HI> liable to death temporal and eternal.</P>
<P N="3">3. And we are all helple&s;s, both with regard to the power and to the guilt of &s;in. For <HI>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> None le&s;s than the Almighty. Who can rai&s;e tho&s;e that are <HI>Dead,</HI> &s;piritually dead in &s;in? None but He who rai&s;ed us from the du&s;t of the earth But on what con&s;idera|tion will he do this? <HI>Not for works of righteou&s;ne&s;s that we have done. The dead cannot prai&s;e thee, O Lord!</HI> Nor do any thing for the &s;ake of which they &s;hould be rai&s;ed to life. Whatever therefore GOD does, he does it merely for the &s;ake of his well-be-loved Son: <HI>He was wounded for our trangre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities. He him&s;elf bore all our &s;ins in his own body upon the tree. He was de|livered for our offences, and ro&s;e again for our ju&s;ti|fication.</HI> Here then is the &s;ole <HI>meritorious cau&s;e</HI> of every ble&s;&s;ing we do or can enjoy: In particular of our pardon and acceptance with GOD, of our full and free ju&s;tification. But by what means do we become intere&s;ted in what CHRIST has done and &s;uf|fered? <HI>Not by works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t;</HI> but by faith alone. <HI>We conclude,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>that a man is ju&s;tified by faith, without the works of the law.</HI> And <HI>to as many as</HI> thus <HI>receive Him, giveth he power to become the &s;ons of God: Even to tho&s;e that believe in his name, who were born, not of the will of man, but of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. And <HI>except a man be thus born again, he can|not &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> But all who are thus <HI>born of the &s;pirit,</HI> have <HI>the kingdom of God within</HI> them. Chri&s;t &s;ets up his kingdom in their hearts; <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> That <HI>mind
<PB N="20" REF="012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0">is in them, which was in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> enabling them to <HI>walk as Chri&s;t al&s;o walked.</HI> His in-dwelling-&s;pirit makes them both holy in heart, and <HI>holy in all man|ner of conver&s;ation.</HI> But &s;till, &s;eeing all this is a free gift, through the righteou&s;ne&s;s and blood of CHRIST, there is eternally the &s;ame rea&s;on to remember, <HI>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. You are not ignorant, that the&s;e are the fun|damental doctrines which he every where in&s;i&s;ted on. And may they not be &s;ummed up, as it were, in two words, <HI>The new birth,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tification of faith?</HI> The&s;e let us in&s;i&s;t upon with all boldne&s;s, at all times, and in all places: In public (tho&s;e of us who are called thereto) and at all opportunities, in pri|vate. Keep clo&s;e to the&s;e good, old, unfa&s;hionable doctrines, how many &s;oever contradict and bla&s;|pheme. Go on, my brethren, in the <HI>name of the Lord, and in the power of his might,</HI> With all care and deligence, <HI>keep that &s;afe that is committed to your tru&s;t:</HI> Knowing that <HI>heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away; but</HI> this truth <HI>&s;hall not pa&s;s away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. But will it be &s;ufficient, to keep clo&s;e to his <HI>Doctrines,</HI> how pure &s;oever they are? Is there not a point of &s;till greater importance than this, namely to drink into his <HI>Spirit?</HI> Herein to <HI>be a follower of</HI> him, <HI>even as</HI> he was <HI>of Chri&s;t?</HI> Without this, the purity of our doctrines, would only increa&s;e our damnation. This therefore is the principal thing, to copy after his &s;pirit. And allowing that in &s;ome points, we mu&s;t be content, to <HI>admire</HI> what we can|not <HI>imitate;</HI> yet in many others we may, through the &s;ame free grace, be partakers of the &s;ame ble&s;|&s;ing. Con&s;cious then of our own wants, and of his bounteous love, who <HI>giveth liberally and upbraideth not,</HI> cry to Him that worketh all in all, for a mea|&s;ure
<PB N="21" REF="012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0">of the &s;ame precious faith: Of the &s;ame zeal and activity, the &s;ame tender-heartedne&s;s, charita|blene&s;s, bowels of mercies. Wre&s;tle with GOD for &s;ome degree of the &s;ame grateful, friendly, affecti|onate temper; of the &s;ame openne&s;s, &s;implicity, and godly &s;incerity, <HI>Love without di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> Wre&s;tle on, till the Power from on high works in you the &s;ame &s;teady courage and patience: And a|bove all, becau&s;e it is the crown of all, the &s;ame in|variable integrity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Is there any other fruit of the grace of GOD, with which he was eminently endowed, and the want of which among the children of GOD he fre|quently and pa&s;&s;ionately lamented? There is one, that is, <HI>Catholic love:</HI> That &s;incere and tender af|fection, which is due to all tho&s;e, who, we have rea&s;on to believe, are children of GOD by faith: In other words, all tho&s;e in every per&s;ua&s;ion, who <HI>fear God and work righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He longed to &s;ee all who had <HI>ta&s;ted the good word,</HI> of a truly <HI>catholic &s;pirit,</HI> (a word little under&s;tood and &s;till le&s;s experi|enced by many, who have it frequently in their mouth.) Who is he that an&s;wers this character? Who is a man of a <HI>catholic &s;pirit?</HI> One who loves a friend, as brethren in the LORD, as joint partakers of the pre&s;ent kingdom of heaven, and fellow-heirs of his eternal kingdom, all of whatever opinion, mode of wor&s;hip, or congregation, who believes in the LORD JESUS; who love GOD and man; who rejoice to plea&s;e, and fear to offend GOD, are care|ful to ab&s;tain from evil, and zealous of good works. He is a man of truly catholic &s;pirit, who bears the&s;e continually upon his heart: Who having an un&s;peak|able tenderne&s;s for their per&s;ons, and an earne&s;st de|&s;ire
<PB N="22" REF="012280_0012_0F8A8A2D60ADAD48">of their welfare, does not cea&s;e to commend them to GOD in prayer, as well as to plead their cau&s;e before men: Who &s;peaks comfortably to them, and labours by all his words, to &s;trengthen their hands in GOD. He a&s;&s;i&s;ts them to the uttermo&s;t of his power, in all things, &s;piritual and temporal. He is ready to <HI>&s;pend and to be &s;pent</HI> for them; yea, to <HI>lay down his life for</HI> his <HI>brethren.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. How amiable a character is this? How de&s;ira|ble to every child of GOD! But why is it then &s;o rarely found? How is it, that there are &s;o few in&s;tance of it? Indeed, &s;uppo&s;ing we have ta&s;ted of the love of GOD, how can any of us re&s;t, till it is our own? Why, there is a delicate device, whereby Satan per|&s;uades thou&s;ands, that they may &s;top &s;hort of it and yet be guiltle&s;s. It is well, if many here pre|&s;ent are not in this <HI>&s;nare of the devil, taken captive at his will.</HI> <Q>O yes, &s;ays one, I have all this love for tho&s;e I believe to be children of GOD. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> will never believe he is a child of GOD, who be|longs to that <HI>vile congregation!</HI> Can he, do you think, be a child of GOD, who holds &s;uch <HI>dete&s;ta|ble opinions?</HI> Or he that joins in &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;uper&s;titious, if not idolatrous <HI>wor&s;hip.</HI></Q> So we ju&s;tify our&s;elves in one &s;in, by adding a &s;econd to it. We excu&s;e the want of love in our&s;elves, by laying the blame on others. To colour our own devili&s;h temper we pronounce our brethren children of the devil. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> beware, of this! And if you are already taken in the &s;nare, e&s;cape out of it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Go and learn that truly catholic love, which <HI>is not ra&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ha&s;ty</HI> in judging: That love which <HI>thinketh no evil,</HI> which <HI>believeth and hopeth all things:</HI> Which make all the allowances for others, that we de&s;ire other &s;hould make for us. Then we &s;hall take knowledge
<PB N="23" REF="012280_0012_0F8A8A2D60ADAD48">of the grace of GOD, which is in every man, what|ever be his opinion or mode of wor&s;hip. Then will all that fear GOD be near and dear unto us, <HI>in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Was not this the &s;pirit of our dear friend? And why &s;hould it not be ours? O thou GOD of love, how long &s;hall thy people be a by word among the heathen? How long &s;hall they laugh us to &s;corn, and &s;ay, <Q>See how <HI>the&s;e</HI> Chri&s;tians love one ano|ther?</Q> When wilt thou roll away our reproach! <HI>Shall the &s;word devour for ever?

<P N="10">10. O GOD, with thee no word is impo&s;&s;ible: thou do&s;t what what&s;oever plea&s;eth thee!

Let</HI> his <HI>Spirit re&s;t upon</HI> the&s;e thy &s;ervants! Shew thou art the GOD that <HI>an&s;wered by fire!</HI> Let the fire of thy love
