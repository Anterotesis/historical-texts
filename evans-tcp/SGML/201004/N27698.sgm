<HEAD>AN EPITOME OF THE <HI>LIFE &amp; CHARACTER</HI> OF THOMAS JEFFERSON.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS JEFFERSON was born in the year 1743, in the county of Albemarle in Virginia, where he now re&s;ides. His father was a reputable land-holder of that county, and gave this, his elde&s;t &s;on, a college education at the univer&s;ity of William and Mary, in the city of William&s;burg. After pa&s;&s;ing his degrees, being de&s;ign|ed for the bar, Mr. Jeffer&s;on commenced a &s;tudent at law, under the guidance of George Wythe, now the venerable judge and &s;olo chancellor of Virginia.</P>
<P>In 1766, Mr. Jeffer&s;on came to the bar of the &s;upreme court of his native &s;tate, and continued to practi&s;e therein with great &s;uc|ce&s;s and reputation, until the commencement of the American re|volution in 1775, and the con&s;equent occlu&s;ion of the courts of jus|tice: during this period of active practice, the indu&s;trious mind of Jeffer&s;on found time to dige&s;t the fir&s;t volume of reports of adjudg|ed ca&s;es in the &s;upreme courts of Virginia, which were ever exhib|ited in that &s;tate, and which to this day are admitted authority in tho&s;e courts; remaining a monument of his early labors and u&s;eful talents.</P>
<P>In 1774, when all America were rou&s;ed into action by the ag|gravated wrongs of the Briti&s;h government, Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;tepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and pub|li&s;hed his much admired pamphlet, <HI>"Summary View of the Rights of British America,"</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to the King, which brought forth again&s;t the author threats of pro&s;ecution for trea&s;on, by lord Dun|more, then governor of Virginia; threats which produced no other effect on the independent mind of Jeffer&s;on, than publicly to avow him&s;elf the author, prepared to meet all con&s;equences.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Jeffer&s;on married the daughter of Mr. Wayles, an eminent coun&s;ellor at law, and continued to enjoy un|interrupted dome&s;tic felicity in the &s;ociety of one of the mo&s;t amin|able of women, until the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues and the guardian of their two daugh|ters
<PB N="2" REF="036921_0002_100B5E24FB43C4A8">and &s;urviving i&s;&s;ue, to who&s;e education and &s;ettlement in life, and the &s;ervice of his country, he has ever &s;ince faithfully devoted him&s;elf, &s;till remaining a widower.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was elected a member of the Virginia convention, and on the 4th of Augu&s;t, in the &s;ame year, one of the members to repre&s;ent the &s;tate, then colony, of Virginia in congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In that memorable year, 1776, the natal year of American e|mancipation from Briti&s;h tyranny, and of the independence and &s;overeignty of the United States, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was one of a com|mittee of five, to wit, Thomas Jeffer&s;on, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. R. Living&s;ton; appointed by Congre&s;s to draught the Declaration of Independence; and it was from the pen and enlightened mind of Jeffer&s;on, fir&s;t named of the committee, that that glorious in&s;trument proceeded, which was re|ported by the committee, and unanimou&s;ly adopted by Congre&s;s, entitled, "<HI>The Declaration of Independence,</HI> &amp;c." An in&s;trument which, &s;o long as the records of time &s;hall endure, will perpetuato the fame of its author; and pre&s;erve in the American mind, <HI>fore|ver</HI> and <HI>inseparable,</HI> the names of <HI>Independence</HI> and <HI>Jefferson.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1776, the ardent mind of Jeffer&s;on, eagerly pur&s;uing the glorious principles of the revolution, and fore&s;eeing that &s;o long as the corruptions of Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tems exi&s;ted, we were independent in name not in fact, produced for the adoption of the legi&s;lature of his native &s;tate the four following important acts, to wit:&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An act for e&s;tabli&s;hing religious freedom.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An act to regulate de&s;cents, to prevent e&s;tates entail, and the rights of primogeniture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An act for the apportionment of crimes and puni&s;hments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. An act to e&s;tabli&s;h public &s;chools.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The influence of the&s;e acts upon the relative principles they embrace, will be univer&s;ally &s;een and felt by tho&s;e who prize civil liberty as a primary ble&s;&s;ing, and regard the pre&s;ervation of it as a|mong the fir&s;t behe&s;ts of God to man&mdash;whil&s;t &s;y&s;tems of univer&s;al toleration in matters of religion; for an equal di&s;tribution of pro|perty; and in &s;ubver&s;ion of the ari&s;tocratic and unnatural principle of entail and primogeniture right; for ameliorating the &s;anguinary code of criminal law; and for extending to the poore&s;t cla&s;s of our citizens, the benefits of education at public expen&s;e, will be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealou&s;ly endeavoring to promote the happine&s;s and improve the condition of his fellow-beings.</P>
<P>Equally evincive of watchful regard to the rights of his country|men, was the &s;cheme and &s;ugge&s;tion made by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, for the formation and adoption of the con&s;titution of Virginia, in the &s;ame
<PB N="3" REF="036921_0003_100B5E7019E16590">year, and for prefixing thereto "A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalienable rights of man," which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being then a member of the Vir|ginia legi&s;lature, pre&s;ented to that body the act to "prevent the importation of &s;laves," which was enacted into a law in the month of October in the &s;ame year, and was &s;hortly after followed by ano|ther act "to authorize manumi&s;&s;ions," being the commencement of a &s;y&s;tem of gradual emancipation, al&s;o propo&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>In the year 1779, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, at the age of 36, was cho&s;en governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781 &mdash;during which time the &s;tate experienced three inva&s;ions, and was al&s;o brought into a critical &s;tate of colli&s;ion re&s;pecting its boundary lines, with two neighboring &s;tates, North-Carolina and Penn&s;ylva|nia. His conduct in that &s;tation, amid&s;t the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of foreign inva&s;ion and dome&s;tic di&s;quietude, was &s;uch as &s;ecured to him, &s;ix months after he left the office, and upon the fulle&s;t public enquiry, the <HI>unanimous</HI> vote of thanks of the le|gi&s;lature, con&s;i&s;ting of 180 members, "for his attentive admini&s;tra|tion of the powers of the executive whil&s;t in office."</P>
<P>It was during the &s;ame year, 1781, amid&s;t the cares of govern|ment and &s;cenes of private affliction, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on prepared his celebrated work, afterwards publi&s;hed in France, and which he mode&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>"Notes on Virginia."</HI> In this work, &s;o ju&s;tly admi|red by all the learned world, for its philo&s;ophical re&s;earch, inge|nious theory, and able di&s;qui&s;ition, equally evidencing an enlarged, liberal, and pious mind, the author, in a &s;uperior &s;tyle of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of M. Buffon and the Abbe Raynal, which tend to di&s;parage the animal &s;pecies, both man and bea&s;t, of the American world, and reduce them to a &s;cale &s;maller than tho&s;e of Europe; vindicating with truth and in|telligence the equal di&s;tribution of nature's ble&s;&s;ings to America.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was again appointed to a &s;eat in Congre&s;s from his native &s;tate, and in the following year, on the 7th of May, was nominated by that honorable body mini&s;ter pleni|potentiary of the United States to the court of France, as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of our illu&s;trious Franklin, whither he embarked early in the &s;ame year, and remained ab&s;ent from the United States, in the ex|ecution of the duties of that important tru&s;t, until the month of October 1789, when he returned home by permi&s;&s;ion of the then pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, who upon being elected to the chief magi|&s;tracy of the federal government, immediately de&s;tined Mr. Jeffer|&s;on to &s;till the next mo&s;t honorable and confidential &s;tation in the executive government, near his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>During his mi&s;&s;ion to France, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, with that peculiar addre&s;s, intelligence, and attention to promote the e&s;&s;ential inter|e&s;ts
<PB N="4" REF="036921_0004_100B5E2977C20470">of the United States, which directs all his conduct, obtained from the French king an arrete, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admi&s;&s;ion, exempt from the cu&s;tomary fo|reign duties, of oil, fi&s;h, and whalebone, the product of the Ameri|can fi&s;heries, into certain ports, and for the &s;ale of American built &s;hips in all the ports of France&mdash;benefits which our ea&s;tern brethren continued to reap the peculiar advantage of, until the commence|ment of the revolutionary convul&s;ions which have agitated that nation.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame period al&s;o, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in conjunction with our immortal Franklin, negociated with a mini&s;ter from the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, then at the Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of the <HI>"Prussian Treaty,"</HI> in which an a&s;toni&s;hed world has, for the fir&s;t time, &s;een a public avowal and po&s;itive provi&s;ion by treaty, between two &s;overeign and independent nations, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e two great and glorious principles, promotive of univer&s;al peace and happine&s;s, to wit, 1&s;t, <HI>"That free ships shall make free goods;"</HI> and 2d, <HI>"That privateering in time of war be abolished"</HI>&mdash;principles which it were to be wi&s;hed could be render|ed univer&s;al and eternal. Mr. Adams, now Pre&s;ident of the Uni|ted States, was one of the commi&s;&s;ion for negociating this treaty, and on its completion it was &s;ent over to London, where Mr. Ad|ams then re&s;ided as mini&s;ter of the United States, for his &s;ignature. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to him&s;elf a &s;hare of the glory which reflects on the au|thors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, &s;ince he became Pre&s;ident of the United States, we have &s;een him nominate his &s;on, John Quincy Adams, as mini&s;ter to the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, as declared, of renewing the trea|ty with that nation, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly, another trea|ty has been made by his &s;on with Pru&s;&s;ia, which has been approv|ed by a majority of the Senate, and ratified by the Pre&s;ident; but which, in&s;tead of renewing and continuing the old treaty, is in it|&s;elf a new one, expre&s;sly abandoning and renouncing the two ines|timable principles, 1&s;t, <HI>"That free ships make free goods,"</HI> and 2d, <HI>"That privateering in time af war be abolished;"</HI>&mdash;principles which, it appears, from the corre&s;pondence accompanying the ne|gociation laid before the Senate of the United States by the Pre&s;i|dent, the wi&s;e and enlightened mini&s;ters of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch were brought with great difficulty and reluctance to abandon, on the earne&s;t &s;olicitation and reiterated demand of the American negociator, under the &s;ugge&s;tion that the maritime powers, <HI>particu|larly Great-Britain,</HI> would never &s;anction or permit them.</P>
<P>In the year 1789, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being returned to the United States, and appointed by Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, &s;ecretary to the de|partment
<PB N="5" REF="036921_0005_100B5E725E3BF1C8">of &s;tate, immediately entered on the arduous duties of that important &s;tation, having previou&s;ly &s;tipulated with the pre|&s;ident, that in con&s;ideration of the many years ab&s;ence from his fa|mily and e&s;tate, he might be permitted at the expiration of the con|&s;titutional term for which the pre&s;ident was elected, to retire from the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;ult of the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on in the department of &s;tate, were exhibited to congre&s;s in the following reports, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. A report on the fi&s;heries of the United States.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. A report, on coins, weights and mea&s;ures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. A report, on the wa&s;te and unappropriated lands of the Uni|ted States.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. A report on the privileges and re&s;trictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Each of the&s;e reports di&s;played the u&s;ual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</P>
<P>But it was re&s;erved for a more critical and delicate period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre-eminent talents of the Ame|rican &s;ecretary &s;hould become more con&s;picuous, and intere&s;tingly u&s;eful to his country: The non-execution of the treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great Britain, her detention of our We&s;tern Po&s;ts, and the attendant &s;poliations on our com|merce, both by Great Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the intrigues of the mini&s;ter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a &s;ituation difficult and perplexing. Be&s;ides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Mis|&s;i&s;ippi, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to all We&s;tern America. In this &s;tate of things, the ju&s;t confidence which the di&s;criminating mind of Wa&s;hington had repo&s;ed in Mr. Jeffer&s;on, was amply repaid by that promptne&s;s, zeal, and ability with which the American &s;ecretary contributed by his labours to relieve the executive from embarra&s;&s;ment. Thro' a &s;eries of ma&s;terly and unequalled diplomatique corre&s;pondence, which he maintained at the &s;ame time, with the re&s;pective mini&s;ters of Great Britain and France&mdash;namely Hammond and Genet, he tra|ver&s;ed and rebutted their re&s;pective cau&s;es of charge and complaint again&s;t the United States, and having fully proved the various ag|gre&s;&s;ions and infractions of treaty on the part of their re&s;pective governments, pointed to the means of pre&s;erving the honor and maintaining the rights of his own country; whil&s;t alike &s;uperior to the intrigues of Great Britain or of France, he fully manife&s;ted that he held no particular attachment to any foreign nation, but was e|qually prepared, with the deci&s;ion, firmne&s;s, and intelligence of a True American, to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of all. The re|cal of Genet, and appointment of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings between the United States and France, the appoint|ment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great Britain and the recal of
<PB N="6" REF="036921_0006_100B5E2E3AB76AF8">Mr. Hammond, appointment of Mr. Li&s;ton, and &s;ub&s;equent pro|ceedings with Great Britain, are all well known. In re&s;pect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on were more immediately effective and complete. Having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States then at Madrid, negociating a treaty with the court of Spain; with the mo&s;t ample and pointed in&s;tructions, and al&s;o of the form and provi&s;ions of a treaty predicated on the ba&s;is of the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, it remained only for Mr. T. Pinckney, the minis|ter from the United States at London, under &s;pecial in&s;truction from the Pre&s;ident, and appointed envoy for that purpo&s;e, to repair to Madrid, and &s;eizing the favorable moment for effecting it, to ac|compli&s;h this de&s;irable work. This was accordingly done, with e|qual promptne&s;s and deci&s;ion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American &s;ecretary in the cabinet, are the Uni|ted States indebted for the mo&s;t liberal, honorable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet entered into with a foreign nation.</P>
<P>About this time, having, at the pre&s;&s;ing entreaty of the then Pre|&s;ident Wa&s;hington, remained one year longer at the head of the de|partment of &s;tate, than he had before &s;tipulated to do, he re&s;igned his office, and retired with the warme&s;t thanks and regret of the Pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, to his e&s;tate at Monticello, in Albermarle County, Virginia, where he continued for upwards of two years uninterruptedly to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic ea&s;e, and a re&s;pite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favorite pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophical re&s;earch and agricultural improvement, until the voice of his country again &s;ummoned him to the more ac|tive &s;cenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the pre&s;idential chair, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Wa&s;hington. The i&s;&s;ue of that election is well known, and but for a fal&s;e return in one &s;tate, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a return in another, Mr. Jeffer&s;on would have been declared Pre&s;ident; as the return however &s;tood before Con|gre&s;s, it appeared that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, con&s;e|quently the latter was declared Pre&s;ident, and the former Vice Pre|&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>In the month of January, 1797, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was elected Pre&s;i|dent of the American Philo&s;ophical Society, held at Philadelphia, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the great and virtuous Rittenhou&s;e, who was the im|mediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of our immortal Franklin, the founder of that &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>for the second time,</HI> the voice of his country has pla|ced Mr. Jeffer&s;on in nomination for the <HI>Presidential chair.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fellow-Citizens of the United States,</HI></P>
<P>The foregoing character of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, is drawn not by the partial hand of a friend, nor under the influence of political or par|ty prejudicies; there is no need of fabrication, fal&s;ehood or decep|tion.
<PB N="7" REF="036921_0007_100B5E749C26A658">You &s;ee it in the faithful and unerring record of his many great and virtuous deeds; in the public u&s;efulne&s;s and eminent &s;er|vices of a well &s;pent life; in the numerous te&s;timonials of his coun|try's approbation, and by the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of the foreign world, in their acknowledged tributes of re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the talents of his head and the virtues of his heart. Its leading features pre|&s;ent to you a man of pure, ardent and affected piety; of &s;incere and genuine virtue; of an enlightened mind and &s;uperior wi&s;dom; the adorer of our God; the patriot of his country; and the friend and benefactor of the whole human race.</P>
<P>And &s;uch, fellow-citizens, is the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real</HI> character of <HI>Tho|mas Jefferson,</HI> unaided by artificial colourings of the fal&s;e varni&s;h of deceptive flattery.</P>

<P>The Pre&s;&s;es, Pulpits, Benches, and Theatres, under the imme|diate direction or intermediate control of government or its agents, have long teemed with the vile&s;t abu&s;e, detraction, and fal&s;hood, re&s;pecting the character of Mr. JEFFERSON. They have repre&s;ent|ed him as a Dei&s;t, di&s;believing the Chri&s;tian Religion; as an A|thei&s;t, denying the being of a God; as a Traitor, &s;triving to &s;ub|ject his country to foreign domination; and as an Anarchi&s;t, &s;eek|ing to &s;ubvert all government and order.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and a number of other charges equally fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, have been echoed and re-echoed, till tho&s;e with whom they origina|ted have, by their own ingenuity, almo&s;t brought them&s;elves to be|lieve what at fir&s;t they knew to be fal&s;e. And numbers who&s;e in|tentions were laudable, but who&s;e means of information were con|tracted, deceived and mi&s;led by the&s;e organs of envy, error, and perver&s;ion, now actually con&s;ider him as a man unworthy public confidence or private e&s;teem.</P>

Unfortunately, however, his virtue and talents have &s;ubjected him to the mo&s;t unqualified abu&s;e and detrac|tion; becau&s;e, while he retained the affections of the people he was an in&s;uperable barrier to the &s;chemes of ambition, avarice, and aggrandizement, which had been planned by men among&s;t us de&s;ti|tute of patrioti&s;m, virtue and honor.</P>
