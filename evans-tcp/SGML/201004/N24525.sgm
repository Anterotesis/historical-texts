<Q>We mu&s;t not judge &s;o unfavorably of Eloquence, as to reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer u&s;es to impo&s;e upon the weak imagination of the multitude, and to &s;erve his own ends.

<HEAD>PREFACE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE name of the Abb&eacute; MAURY hath be|come &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed not only in France, but al&s;o in this and other countries of Eu|rope, that his literary productions will, pro|bably, attract a degree of attention corre&s;|ponding with that, which his public charac|ter and conduct have excited.</P>
<P>As a member of the Con&s;tituting Nation|al A&s;&s;embly, it was his lot to &s;tep forward at an epoch, which will for ever remain memo|rable in the annals of France.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of tho&s;e conte&s;ts and recrim|inations, which prevailed among the differ|ent orders of which that a&s;&s;embly was com|po&s;ed, the Abb&eacute; MAURY &s;tood forth as the champion of the Church, and of Ari&s;tocra|cy. His eloquence and abilities elevated him to di&s;tingui&s;hed importance among&s;t his brethren, while his undaunted &s;pirit acquir|ed fre&s;h energy from the number, the abili|ties, and the attacks of his opponents: thus, though repeatedly foiled, yet like an expir|ing
<PB N="v" REF="032455_0004_0FF26988CD547DA8">hero in the field of battle, he was deter|mined not to yield, but with his late&s;t breath.</P>
<P>His zeal and talents &s;hone con&s;picuous in this cri&s;is of public affairs; and we are in|formed, that he hath &s;ince received from the hands of his Holine&s;s at Rome, the reward of a &s;trenuous defence of a tottering church.</P>
<P>BUT not only hath the Senate borne wit|ne&s;s to his abilities: the Pre&s;s, al&s;o, &s;uper-adds its te&s;timony in various literary produc|tions.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, the &s;ubject of that work, which is here pre&s;ented in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, appears to have occupied his mature&s;t tho'ts; and the ju&s;tice and enlargement of his ideas upon this &s;ubject mark the &s;ucce&s;s, with which he has pur&s;ued it.</P>
<P>To boa&s;t of his attaining to originality of thought on a &s;ubject, which hath been &s;o frequently and &s;o ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, would, doubtle&s;s, be pre&s;umptuous: to in&s;inuate that he has written a complete &s;y&s;tem, would be to contradict his own profe&s;&s;ions; but, to acknowledge, that he has thrown out a vari|ety of u&s;eful hints, and that in his manner of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he is lively and intere&s;ting, is no more than to pay him that tribute, to which his merit may ju&s;tly lay claim.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="032455_0005_0FF2695D73EF8458">
THE following Di&s;&s;ertation is only one of &s;everal, which M. MAURY hath given to the public. There are al&s;o collected in one vol|ume <HI>the Panegyrics of</HI> S. LOUIS and of FENE|LON; <HI>Reflections on the Sermons of</HI> BOSSUET; and <HI>the Panegyric of</HI> S. AUSTIN.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e he has di&s;covered the talents of an Orator, particularly in that &s;pecies of the art &s;tiled <HI>Panegyric,</HI> to which the French have ever &s;hewn more attachment than the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A late publication hath &s;ince appeared, and been attributed to the Abb&eacute;, con&s;i&s;ting, chiefly, of &s;peeches delivered by him in the National A&s;&s;embly.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the work now offered to the public, and which &s;eems the mo&s;t material for a young &s;peaker to peru&s;e, the Abb&eacute; has pre&s;cribed tho&s;e rules, and &s;ugge&s;ted tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, by which he appears to have been guided in his own compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>IN confirmation of the good opinion, which the tran&s;lator has conceived of M. MAURY'S performance, he tran&s;cribes, with plea&s;ure, the remarks of the MONTHLY REVIEWERS on tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, of which the following tran&s;|lation con&s;titutes the fir&s;t:</P>
<Q><P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es relates to va|rious parts of the Eloquence of the Pulpit, and does great honour to the ta&s;te, judg|ment,
<PB N="vii" REF="032455_0006_0FF26A0AB4A49BB8">and feelings of the ingenious author. His reflections on CICERO, DEMOSTHENES, BOSSOET, FENELON, TILLOTSON, MASSIL|LON, BOURDALOUE, SAURIN, BRIDAINE, &amp;c. are &s;en&s;ible and &s;olid; and his pre|cepts and rules are every way adapted to form the ta&s;te of a young Orator to that affecting &s;implicity, which di&s;dains all friv|olous ornaments, and has no other object in view than to touch and to per&s;uade.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e is followed by two Ora|tions that were delivered before the French Academy in honour of St. Louis, and Fenelon; another in honour of St. Augu&s;|tine, delivered in the General A&s;&s;embly of the French Clergy; and a piece intituled, Reflections on the Sermons of Bo&s;&s;uet la&s;t publi&s;hed." All the&s;e are excellent in their kinds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monthly Review,</HI> vol. lvii. p. 309.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>THE te&s;timony of an eminent literary cha|racter now living, were liberty allowed to tran&s;cribe it, and mention his name, would add &s;trength to the foregoing ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>THE Editor feels him&s;elf con&s;trained to apologize for the part he has taken. He began, at fir&s;t, to peru&s;e and tran&s;late Abb&eacute; MAURY'S performance <Q>on the Eloquence of the Pulpit and the Bar,</Q> in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="viii" REF="032455_0007_0FF26A0E94E31390">his private &s;tudies, and merely with a view to his per&s;onal improvement.</P>
<P>SOME elucidations from Engli&s;h authors naturally occurred to his mind, which he has, accordingly, annexed. But it was not till afterwards, and in compliance with the wi&s;h of tho&s;e, who&s;e judgment he re&s;pects, that he thought of &s;ubmitting the whole to public view. He cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that imperfections may di&s;cover them&s;elves to the eye of rigid critici&s;m; while, at the &s;ame time, he would indulge a hope, that the time and pains employed will render this tran&s;la|tion of the Abb&eacute;'s &s;entiments not wholly unacceptable to the young &s;tudent and read|er, for who&s;e u&s;e it is principally de&s;igned.</P>
<P>IT will appear, on peru&s;al, that the Abb&eacute; MAURY'S predilection for French Preachers and Orators gives a tincture of &s;everity to his cen&s;ures on the Engli&s;h; and that, in one or two in&s;tances, his zeal for the Romi&s;h Church embitters his language with regard to the conduct and writings of &s;ome Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>EVERY man hath his partialities. For the prejudices of education, country, connexions, great allowances mu&s;t, and, by every liberal mind, will be made. This is an age of free enquiry; and, in proportion as this &s;pirit prevails, we &s;hall &s;ay with the poet,</P>
<Q><PB N="ix" REF="032455_0008_0FF26A148C56A160">
<L>&mdash;Veniam petimus</L>
<L>Dabimu&s;que vici&s;&s;im.</L></Q>
<P>FREE liberty mu&s;t, therefore, be allowed to every reader to judge for him&s;elf what de|gree of regard is to be paid to a few pa&s;&s;ages, wherein the Abb&eacute; gives &s;uch an unbounded preference to &s;ome of his favourite French Catholic Preachers, above tho&s;e of the Pro|te&s;tant Church, and the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>To the works of eloquent French writers recommended by M. MAURY, perhaps it will be no di&s;credit to add as a model of Pulpit-Eloquence, the &s;ermons of the late Rev. CHARLES CHAIS, Pa&s;tor of the French Church at the Hague.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sermons of the Rev. C. CHAIS were printed in 1790, in two volumes; for a character of which, the reader is referred to the Appendix to the &s;eventy-eighth volume of the Monthly Review, and the Appendix to the third volume enlarged.</NOTE></P>
<P>FOR Engli&s;h authors and preachers, the reader is referred to &s;everal of the notes an|nexed to the following tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>OF tho&s;e who have written profe&s;&s;edly on the &s;ubject of Eloquence, the &s;tudent may profitably peru&s;e CICERO, QUINTILIAN, and LONGINUS among the ancients; and &s;uch modern authors as WARD, GIBBON, FORDYCE, CAMPBELL, BLAIR, and POLWHELE; to which may be added ROLLIN, and FENELON.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRINCIPLES OF ELOQUENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN pre&s;enting the public with this feeble production, I propo&s;e, with a ju&s;t diffi|dence of my own abilities, to lay before them &s;ome ob&s;ervations which have occurred to me in the cour&s;e of my reading, or oratorial compo&s;itions, re&s;pecting the art of Eloquence, which it is the &s;tudy of my life to cultivate.</P>
<P>THEY were written at fir&s;t merely for my own private u&s;e. If I have &s;ometimes giv|en a decided opinion, I intreat the reader to remember that I &s;peak to him with freedom yet without pre&s;umption, and that I my&s;elf
<PB N="2" REF="032455_0013_0FF26A1DDD69E070">am far from con&s;idering the re&s;ult of my ob&s;ervations as laying down rules of the art.</P>
<P>THE general idea which I form, at fir&s;t view, of the eloquence of the pulpit is this.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>A De&s;cription of the Eloquence of the Pulpit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A MAN of &s;en&s;ibility di&s;covers his friend about to take a &s;tep contrary to his in|tere&s;t or duty. He is de&s;irous of oppo&s;ing it, but he is afraid of repelling confidence by a ha&s;ty contradiction. He gently in&s;in|uates him&s;elf into his mind. He does not, at fir&s;t, oppo&s;e. He enquires. He is not regarded. He requires only to be heard, and in&s;tantly he &s;tates his rea&s;ons, and offers convincing arguments with mode&s;t diffi|dence.&mdash;No an&s;wer is returned. He then complains, not of ob&s;tinacy, but of &s;ilence. He meets all objections and refutes them. Animated by the tender zeal of friend&s;hip, he is far from attempting to &s;hine by his wit, or to di&s;hearten by his reproaches. He &s;peaks only the language of affection. At length a&s;&s;ured of having arre&s;ted the attention of his friend, he uncovers the precipice under his feet, and &s;hews him all its depth, in or|der
<PB N="3" REF="032455_0014_0FF26A1FD28F01D0">to alarm his imagination, that weake&s;t, and yet mo&s;t predominant of our faculties.</P>
<P>HE thus &s;ucceeds in moving him. He now de&s;cends to entreaty, and gives an unre&s;train|ed vent to his &s;ighs and tears.&mdash;The work is done; the heart yields, and his friend is ful|ly per&s;uaded. They both embrace; and it is to the eloquence of friend&s;hip that rea&s;on and virtue are indebted for the honour of victory.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN ORATORS! behold your model. Let that compa&s;&s;ionate man who &s;hould be af|fected with &s;ympathetic tenderne&s;s in order to convince, be you; and that friend who &s;hould be moved in order to be undeceived, be your auditory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>Of the Means of per&s;uading a large A&s;&s;embly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is only nece&s;&s;ary, in fact, for the Orator to keep one man in view amid&s;t the mul|titude that &s;urrounds him; and, excepting tho&s;e enumerations which require &s;ome vari|ety in order to paint the pa&s;&s;ions, conditions, and characters, he ought merely, while com|po&s;ing, to addre&s;s him&s;elf to that one man,

This is he whom the Orator ought never to lo&s;e &s;ight of in writing, till he obtains a conque&s;t over his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

<P>WHETHER it be a moral &s;ubject that is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, or one's talents be exer|ci&s;ed upon panegyrics or my&s;teries, it is al|ways nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve a &s;pecified progre&s;|&s;ion in the di&s;tribution of the plan, in order to impart an increa&s;ing force to the points adduced, to give weight to the argument, and energy to the rhetorical movements. It is as rare as it is difficult to render both parts of a &s;ermon equally excellent, becau&s;e the &s;ame re&s;ources &s;eldom pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the imagination of the Orator. The lat|ter, however, ought to excel the former. El|oquence always declines when it cea&s;es to ri&s;e. It is therefore to the &s;econd branch of the divi&s;ion that the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive argu|ments and pathetic &s;entiments ought to be re&s;erved.</P>
<P>CICERO, who&s;e plan is very di&s;tinct in all his Orations, although &s;eldom announced in the exordium, adopts a method very favour|able to the advancement of his proofs, which obliges him to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ing him&s;elf con|tinually by fre&s;h efforts in proportion as he proceeds in the difficulties of his &s;ubject.</P>

OPEN his Orations. He at once denies the fact which is oppo&s;ed to him; and after|wards he proves, that, by taking its truth for granted, nothing could thereby be concluded again&s;t his client.</P>
<P>I SHALL only quote here two &s;triking ex|amples of this excellent method.</P>
<P>In defending Archais who had been his preceptor, and of whom he always &s;peaks with the mo&s;t lively gratitude, Cicero thus divides his Oration; <Q>I &s;hall prove that Ar|chais is a Roman citizen; and that, if he were not, he would be very de&s;erving to be one.</Q></P>
<P>THE plan of the Oration in favour of Milo is no le&s;s forcible. "Milo," &s;ays he, <Q>hath not &s;lain Clodius; if he had &s;lain him, he would have done well.</Q> The mind of man cannot rea&s;on with more per|&s;picuity and energy.</P>
<P>NOR are we to conclude that Cicero pro|ceeds thus accidentally on &s;ome particular occa&s;ions. In his "Oratorial divi&s;ions," in that charming dialogue where this great man &s;ubmits to an examination upon this art, by an&s;wering all the que&s;tions which his &s;on puts to him upon Eloquence, Cicero e&s;tabli&s;hes, as a fixed rule, this manner of dividing the di&s;cour&s;e.

<P>TO all tho&s;e rules which art furni&s;hes for conducting the plan of a di&s;cour&s;e, we proceed to &s;ubjoin a general rule from which Orators, and e&s;pecially Chri&s;tian Orators, ought never to &s;werve.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch begin their career, the zeal for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls which animates them, doth not render them always unmindful of the glory which follows great &s;ucce&s;s. A blind de&s;ire to &s;hine and to plea&s;e is often at

<P>IT is unque&s;tionably to be wi&s;hed that he who devotes him&s;elf to the arduous labours which preaching requires, &s;hould be wholly ambitious to render him&s;elf u&s;eful to the cau&s;e of religion.

<P>IS it on your own account that you preach? Is it for you that religion a&s;&s;embles her vota|ries in a temple? You ought not to indulge &s;o pre&s;umptuous a thought. However, I on|ly con&s;ider you as an Orator. Tell me then; what is this you call Eloquence?

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. <HI>Of Cicero.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT would be a vain attempt to excu&s;e the di&s;tance &s;o perceptible between the Ad|vocates of the French Bar, and the Orators of the Roman Senate, by &s;ugge&s;ting the differ|ent intere&s;ts which were entru&s;ted to them. Cicero, I know, has &s;ometimes had the glory of being &s;tyled "the Defender of the Repub|lic:" But did he not often undertake cau&s;es of le&s;s importance? and are not mo&s;t of his Orations devoted to the affairs of his fellow-citizens? This great man wanted not an ex|traordinary Auditory in order to di&s;play all the riches of his genius. He was more elo|quent when he pleaded before the Roman people, than when he &s;poke in the pre&s;ence of Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>HIS Oration for Ligarius is written in a charming &s;tyle; but it is not con&s;idered as the mo&s;t eloquent of his works. Cicero re|que&s;ts the life of Ligarius of an u&s;urper, as if he were imploring the clemency of a lawful &s;overeign. The commendations which he lavi&s;hes on Cae&s;ar in the ingenious conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech, &s;eem to ju&s;tify the reproaches which he received from the &s;toic Brutus, after
<PB N="40" REF="032455_0051_0FF26A6E6C4C7828">the death of the Dictator, in that famous let|ter where Brutus accu&s;es him of flattering Oc|tavius, and which is ju&s;tly ranked among&s;t the chief productions of antiquity.</P>
<P>IT is in his Orations again&s;t Verres; again&s;t Cataline; in his &s;econd Philippic; in the conclu&s;ions of all his &s;peeches; it is in his treati&s;es of "the Orator," and "of illu&s;trious Orators," that we find the Eloquence of Cicero. All his writings ought to be the manual of Chri&s;tian Orators.</P>
<P>THE rapidity with which he compo&s;ed his immortal di&s;cour&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the mul|tiplicity and importance of the concerns which oppre&s;&s;ed him, did not prevent him from be|&s;towing on his &s;tyle a perfection &s;o uncom|mon, that it is as ea&s;y to under&s;tand his Ora|tions, as it is difficult, and perhaps even im|po&s;&s;ible to tran&s;late them well. His example evidently proves that our Advocates &s;hould not ju&s;tify their inattention to Elocution by the inevitable avocations of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT was during a very &s;hort interval, and amid&s;t the agitation of a civil war, that Cicero publi&s;hed his famous Orations again&s;t Marc Antony, which he called his Philippics.</P>
<P>WE are at a lo&s;s to conceive how he could retain &s;ufficient freedom of mind, after the death of Cae&s;ar, and in the &s;ixty-fourth and la&s;t year of his life, to compo&s;e tho&s;e fourteen

<P>CICERO, as an Orato, is thus characterized by Dr. BLAIR: <Q>In all his orations there is high art. He begins generally with a regular exordium; and with much preparation and in&s;inuation prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the hearers, and &s;tudies to gain their affections. His method is clear, and his arguments are arranged with great pro|priety. His method is indeed more clear than that of Demo&s;t|henes, and this is one advantage which he has over him: we find every thing in its proper place. He never attempts to more till he has endeavoured to convince; and in moving, e&s;pecially the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, he is very &s;ucce&s;sful. No man that ever wrote, knew the power and force of words better than Cicero. He rolls them along with the greate&s;t beauty and pomp; and, in the &s;tructure of his &s;entences, is curious and exact to the high|e&s;t degree. He is always full and flowing, never abrupt. He is a great amplifier of every &s;ubject; magnificent, and in his &s;en|timents, highly moral. Though his manner i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the whole, diffu&s;e, yet it is often happily varied, and &s;uited to the &s;ubject. When a great public object abu&s;ed his mind, and demanded in|dignation and force, he departs con&s;iderably from that loo&s;e and declamatory manner to which he inclines at other times, and becomes exceedingly cogent and vehement.... This great Orator, however, is not without his defects. In mo&s;t of his orations there is too much art, even carried to the length of o&s;tentation. He &s;eems often to aim at obtaining admiration, rather than at ope|rating conviction. Hence, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, he is &s;hewy rather than &s;olid; and diffu&s;e, where he ought to have been pre&s;&s;ing. His &s;entences are, at all times, round and &s;onorous; they can|not be accu&s;ed of monotony, for they po&s;&s;e&s;s variety of cadence; but from too great a &s;tudy of magnificence, he is &s;ometimes de|ficient in &s;trength. Though the &s;ervices which he had perform|ed to his country were very con&s;iderable, yet he is too much his own panegyri&s;t. Ancient manners which impo&s;ed fewer re|&s;traints on the &s;ide of decorum, may, in &s;ome degree, excu&s;e, but cannot entirely ju&s;tify his vanity.</Q></P>

Demo&s;thenes, who burns and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> down all before him with an irre&s;i&s;tible violence, rapidity, &s;trength and fury, may be compared to an hurricane or a thunderbolt: but Cicero's Eloquence, I apprehend, re&s;embles &s;ome overwhelming conflagration, that &s;preads and de&s;troys all before it, retains an inten&s;e and inextingui&s;hable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, breaks out in different forms in different places, and is nouri&s;hed by inexhau&s;tible &s;upplies of fuel.</Q></P>

<P>M. ROLLIN, remarking on this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e reflec|tions of the Abp. are extremely rational and judicious; and the clo&s;er we examine his opinion, the more we find it conformable to good &s;en&s;e, right rea&s;on, and the mo&s;t exact rules of true rhe|toric. But whoever would take upon him to prefer Demo&s;the|nes' Orations to tho&s;e of Cicero, ought, in my opinion, to po&s;&s;e&s;s pretty near as much &s;olidity, force, and elevation of mind, as Demo&s;thenes mu&s;t have had to compo&s;e them. Whether it be owing to an old prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of an author we have con|&s;tantly read from our tender years; or that we are accu&s;tomed to a &s;tyle which agrees more with our manners, and is more adap|ted to our capacities, we cannot be per&s;uaded to prefer the &s;evere au&s;terity of Demo&s;thenes to the in&s;inuating &s;oftne&s;s of Cicero; and we chu&s;e to follow our own inclination and ta&s;te for an au|thor who is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, our friend and acquaintance, rath|er than to declare, upon the credit of another, in favour of one that is almo&s;t a &s;tranger to us.</Q></P> <BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belle Lettres,</HI> vol. ii. ch. iii. &sect;. 3. p. 261.</BIBL>
<P>Mr. HUME joins with tho&s;e critics who give the preference to Demo&s;thenes. Speaking of the charms of Cicero's Eloquence, he &s;ays, <Q>Some objections I own, notwith&s;tanding his va&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, may lie again&s;t &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the Roman Orator. He is too florid and rhetorical; his figures are too &s;triking and palpable; the divi&s;ions of his di&s;cour&s;e are drawn chiefly from the rules of the &s;chools; and his wit di&s;dains not always the artifice even of pun, a rhyme, or jingle of words. The Grecian addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to an Audience much le&s;s refined than the Roman Senate or Judges. The lowe&s;t vulgar of Athens were his &s;overeigns, and the arbiters of his Eloquence. Yet is his manner more cha&s;te and au&s;tere than that of the other. Could it be copied, its &s;uc|ce&s;s would be infallible over a modern A&s;&s;embly. It is rapid harmony, exactly adju&s;ted to the &s;en&s;e: it is vehement rea&s;on|ing, without any appearance of art: it is di&s;dain, anger, bold|ne&s;s, freedom, involved in a continued &s;tream of argument. And of all human productions, the Orations of Demo&s;thenes pre&s;ent to us the models which approach the neare&s;t to perfection.</Q></P>

<P>Mr. KNOX ob&s;erves, that <Q>Many critics have employed their talents in making compari&s;ons between Demo&s;thenes and Tully.</Q> <Q>All of them agree in attributing to the former conci&s;ene&s;s, and to the latter diffu&s;ion: and, according to this judgment, they have not he&s;itated to give the preference to the Athenian. The conci&s;e vehemence of Demo&s;thenes carried all before it by vio|lence; the prolixity of Cicero gained ground by the &s;oft arts of in&s;inuation. The effect of the former was &s;udden and irre&s;i&s;ti|ble; that of the latter, comparatively weak and dilatory.</Q></P>

<P>IT is the irrefragable force of the rea&s;oning; it is the irre&s;i&s;tible rapidity of the rhetorical movements, which characterize the Eloquence of the Athenian Orator. When he writes, it is to give &s;trength, energy, and vehemence to his thoughts. He &s;peaks, not as an elegant writer who wi&s;hes to be admired, but as a pa&s;&s;ionate man tormented by truth; as a citi|zen

<P>HE is the champion of Rea&s;on. He de|fends her with all the &s;trength of his genius: and the ro&s;trum where he &s;peaks becomes the place of combat. He at once conquers his auditors, his adver&s;aries, his judges. He does not &s;eem to endeavour to move you: hear him, however, and he &s;hall cau&s;e you to weep upon reflection. He overwhelms his fellow citizens with reproaches; but, then, the&s;e are only the interpreters of their own remor&s;e.</P>
<P>DOTH he refute an argument? He does not di&s;cu&s;s it. He propo&s;es a &s;ingle que&s;tion for the whole an&s;wer, and the objection no longer appears.</P>
<P>DOTH he wi&s;h to &s;tir up the Athenians again&s;t Philip? It is no more an Orator who &s;peaks: it is a General; it is a King; it is a Prophet; it is the Tutelar Angel of his country. And when he threatens his fellow citizens with &s;lavery, we think that we hear from a di&s;tance the noi&s;e approaching of the rattling chains which the tyrant is bringing them.</P>
<P>THE Philippics of Demo&s;thenes, and his famous Oration "pro corona," in favour of
<PB N="48" REF="032455_0059_0FF269981E370FC8">Cte&s;iphon, are ju&s;tly admired; but I appre|hend that the learned, and Chri&s;tian Orators read but little of his other works; his di&s;|cour&s;e on the peace, his fir&s;t and &s;econd Olynthiac, his Oration of Cher&s;one&s;us, and many other ma&s;terly productions truly wor|thy of his genius.

<P>IT is enough to repeat here one &s;ingle pa&s;|&s;age.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE enemies of Demo&s;thenes, (certain wri|ters without talents, Ae&s;chines excepted, who pre&s;umed to con&s;ider them&s;elves as his rivals becau&s;e they &s;et them&s;elves up for Orators in Athens,) accu&s;ed him of &s;eeking, in his di&s;|cour&s;es, rather his own reputation, than the public good. This great man, abu&s;ed for a long while without complaining, deigned at length to confute their clamours in the pre|&s;ence of all the Athenian people. He thus addre&s;&s;es them in his Oration of Cher&s;one&s;us:</P>
<P><Q>I AM &s;o far from regarding all tho&s;e con|temptible Orators as citizens de&s;erving of their country, that, &s;hould any one &s;ay to me this moment, And thou, Demo&s;thenes, what &s;ervices ha&s;t thou rendered to the<PB N="49" REF="032455_0060_0FF269AD8D48D548">Republic? I would neither, O Athenians, &s;peak of the expen&s;es I have incurred on behalf of my fellow-citizens in the di&s;|charge of my employments, nor of the cap|tives whom I have redeemed, nor of the gifts which I have pre&s;ented to the city, nor of all the monuments which will one day te&s;tify my zeal for my country; but this is the an&s;wer I &s;hould make: My con|duct hath always been the rever&s;e of the maxims of the&s;e Orators. I could, doubt|le&s;s, have followed their example, and like them, have flattered you. But I have al|ways &s;acrificed my per&s;onal advantage, my ambition, and even the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing you.

No; I never indulged the expectation of attaining the fir&s;t place among you, were I even to make you the lowe&s;t of mankind.</Q></P>
<P>IT is to tho&s;e enemies, and to the &s;ad ne|ce&s;&s;ity of cru&s;hing them with all the weight of his genius and virtue, that Demo&s;thenes is indebted for this &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age, one of the fine&s;t &s;trokes of his Eloquence.</P>

Is Demo&s;thenes an Orator who amu&s;es him&s;elf barely with tickling the ear, by the &s;ound and harmony of periods; or does he impo&s;e upon the mind by a florid &s;tyle and &s;nining thoughts? Such Eloquence may, indeed, dazzle and charm, the moment we hear it; but the impre&s;&s;ion it makes is of a &s;hort duration. What we admire in Demo&s;thenes, is the plan, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eries, and the order and di&s;po&s;ition of the Oration; it is the &s;trength of the proofs, the &s;olidity of the argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the grandeur and noblene&s;s of the &s;entiments, and of the &s;tyle; the vivicity of the turns and figures; in a word, the wonderful art of repre|&s;enting the &s;ubjects he treats, in all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tre, and di&s;playing them in all their &s;trength. But that which di&s;tingui&s;hes De|mo&s;thenes &s;till more, and in which no one has imitated him, is, that he forgets-him&s;elf &s;o entirely; is always &s;o &s;crupulous in avoiding every thing that might look like a &s;hew or parade of wit and genius; and &s;o careful to make the Auditor attend to the cau&s;e, and not to the Orator, that no exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ion, turn or thought, ever e&s;cape him, which are calculated merely to &s;hine. This re&s;ervedne&s;s, this moderation, in &s;o fine a genius as Demo&s;thenes, and in topics &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of graces and elegance, rai&s;es his merit to its highe&s;t pitch, and is &s;uperior to all encomiums.</Q></P>

<P>Dr. BLAIR makes the following remarks on the &s;tyle of Demo&s;t|henes: <Q>His Orations are &s;trongly animated; and full of the im|petuo&s;ity and fire of public &s;pirit. They proceed in a continued &s;train of inductions, con&s;equences, and demon&s;trations founded on &s;ound rea&s;on. The figures which he u&s;es are never &s;ought after; but always ri&s;e from the &s;ubject. He employs them &s;paringly indeed; for &s;plendour and ornament are not the di&s;|tinctions of this Orator's compo&s;ition. It is an energy of thought peculiar to him&s;elf, which forms his character, and &s;ets him above all others. He attends much more to things than to words. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arget the Orator, and think of the bu&s;ine&s;s. He warms the mind, and impels to action. He has no parade and o&s;tentation; no methods of in&s;inuation; no laboured introductions; but is like a man full of his &s;ubject, who, after preparing his audience by a &s;entence or two for hearing plain truths, enters directly on bu&s;i|ne&s;s.... The &s;tyle of Demo&s;thenes is &s;trong and conci&s;e, though &s;ometimes, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, har&s;h and abrupt, His words are very expre&s;&s;ive; his arrangement is firm and manly; and far from being unmu&s;ical. Negligent of le&s;&s;er graces, he &s;eems rather to have aimed at that &s;ublime which lies in &s;enti|ment. His action and pronunciation are recorded to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent; which, from the manner of his compo&s;ition, we are naturally led to believe. The character which one forms of him, from reading his works, is of the au&s;tere, rather than the gentle kind. He is, on every occa&s;ion, grave, &s;erious, pa&s;&s;ionate; takes every thing on a high tone; never lets him&s;elf down, not attempts any thing like plea&s;antry. If any fault can be found to his admirable Eloquence, it is, that he &s;ometimes borders on the hard and dry. He may al&s;o be thought to want &s;moothne&s;s and grace. But the&s;e defects are far more than compen&s;ated, by that admirable and ma&s;terly force of ma&s;|culine Eloquence, which, as it overpowered all who heard it, cannot, at this day, be read without emotion.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. <HI>Of Interrogation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TIME, that de&s;troyer of ill-founded repu|tation, adds, every day, fre&s;h lu&s;tre to the glory of Bo&s;&s;uet. I ob&s;erve, with plea|&s;ure, that this great Orator, who&s;e merit hath been for &s;ome time attacked among us, is more warmly and univer&s;ally admired &s;ince there has been a renunciation of the depraved ta&s;te of the Eloquence of words. The vehe|mence
<PB N="59" REF="032455_0070_0FF26AA8F09DE088">which di&s;tingui&s;hes him, as it does Demo&s;thenes, appears to me frequently de|rived from accumulated interrogations which are equally familiar to each of them.</P>
<P>INDEED, of all the figures of Oratory, Interrogation is the mo&s;t overwhelming and rapid. If it be employed in unfolding the principles on which the di&s;cour&s;e is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, it &s;preads over it an inevitable ob&s;curity, and a &s;pecies of declamation, which di&s;gu&s;ts per&s;ons of good ta&s;te. It is after a clear ex|planation of the obligations of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that particular details of its moral injunctions, enlivened by this impetuous movement, forcibly &s;trike the hearers, add remor&s;e to conviction, and, if I may &s;o &s;peak, arm law again&s;t con&s;cience. It is by earne&s;t and repeated interrogations, that the Orator proves and attacks, accu&s;es and an&s;wers, doubts and affirms, affects and in&s;tructs. Is there, in Eloquence, a &s;urer way to agitate the human heart, than by &s;uch que&s;tions fol|lowing one another in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to which there is no need of waiting for an an|&s;wer, becau&s;e that is unavoidable and uni|form? Can we better manage the pride of the guilty, than by &s;paring him the di&s;grace of a direct reproach, at the very time we are in|forming him of his foibles or his vices? Or &s;ay&mdash;how can we impart more force to truth,
<PB N="60" REF="032455_0071_0FF26A8051869A50">more weight to rea&s;on, than by confining our&s;elves to the &s;imple privilege of interro|gating the wicked? By what means can &s;uch an one elude the Orator, who &s;huts up all the avenues by which he endeavours to e&s;cape from him&s;elf? An Orator, who makes choice of him as judge, as &s;ole judge, as the private judge, of the rece&s;&s;es of his own heart only, which he cannot mi&s;take? What an&s;wer will he return, if the general que&s;tions, which be him&s;elf converts into &s;o many per&s;onal accu|&s;ations, ru&s;h upon him, and gather &s;trength? If, to the&s;e evidences overwhelming to the &s;inner, there follows a &s;ublime and &s;triking repre&s;entation, which terrifies his imagina|tion, and cau&s;es his thoughts to be greatly confu&s;ed?

<P>SUCH is that &s;ublime and famous Apo&s;tro|phe, which MASSILLON addre&s;&s;es to the Su|preme Being, in his &s;ermon, "on the &s;mall number of the elect:" "O God! where are thine elect?" The&s;e words, &s;o plain, &s;pread con&s;ternation. Each hearer places him&s;elf in that li&s;t of reprobates which had preceded this pa&s;&s;age.

<P>THE eloquent RACINE almo&s;t always pro|ceeds by interrogations, in impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cenes; and this figure, which gives &s;uch an ardent rapidity to his &s;tyle, animates and warms all his arguments, none of which are ever cold, &s;lat, or ab&s;tracted.</P>

<P>HERE is Eloquence! here is nature!

They are, indeed, on &s;o many occa&s;ions, the native language of pa&s;&s;ion, that their u&s;e is extremely frequent; and, in ordinary conver&s;ation, when men are heated, they prevail as much as in the mo&s;t &s;ublime Oratory. The unfigured literal u&s;e of Inter|rogation is to a&s;k a que&s;tion; but when men are prompted by pa&s;&s;ion, whatever they would affirm, or deny, with great vehe|mence, they naturally put in the form of a que&s;tion; expre&s;&s;ing thereby the &s;tronge&s;t confidence of the truth of their own &s;enti|ment, and appealing to their hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers for the impo&s;&s;ibility of the contrary. Thus, in Scripture; 'God is not a man that he &s;hould He, neither the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent. Hath he &s;aid? And &s;hall he not do it? Or hath he &s;poken? And &s;hall he not make it good?' (<HI>Numbers</HI> xxiii. 19.) So Demo&s;thenes, addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf to the Athenians; 'Tell me, will you &s;till go about and a&s;k one another, what news? What can be more a&s;toni&s;hing news than this, that the man of Macedon makes war upon the Athenians, and di&s;po&s;es of the affairs of Greece? Is Philip dead? No, but he is &s;ick. What &s;ignifies it to you whether he be dead or alive? For, if any thing happens to this Philip, you will im|mediately rai&s;e up another.' All this, delivered without inter|rogation, had been faint and ineffectual; but the warmth and eagerne&s;s which this que&s;tioning method expre&s;&s;es, awaken the hearers, and &s;trike them with much greater force.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures.</HI> vol. i. p. 355, 356.</BIBL>
<P><Q>Much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e we may add tho&s;e &s;ublime interro|gations in the book of Job, where the Almighty is him&s;elf the Speaker; and that in the eleventh chapter of the &s;ame poem: Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is high as heaven, what can&s;t then do? deeper than hell, what can&s;t thou know? All the energy of this pa&s;&s;age would be lo&s;t if once dive&s;ted of the interrogations; &s;hould it be &s;aid, Thou can&s;t not by &s;earching find out God: Thou can&s;t not find out the Almighty unto perfection: it is high as heaven, and thou can&s;t do nothing; and it is deep as hell, and thou can&s;t know nothing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Another very happy illu&s;tration of the force of this figure may be brought from the &s;peech of St. PAUL, (<HI>Acts</HI> xxvi.) where, with a&s;toni&s;hing effect, he transfers his di&s;cour&s;e from Fe&s;tus to Agrippa. In ver&s;e 26 he &s;peaks of him in the third per&s;on? The King, &s;ays he, 'knows of tho&s;e things, before whom al&s;o I &s;peak freely.'

The &s;mooth|e&s;t Eloquence, (&s;ays Mr. Smith,) the mo&s;t in&s;inuating complai|&s;ance, could never have made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon Agrippa as this unexpected and pathetic addre&s;s.</Q> <BIBL>SMITH'S <HI>Longinus,</HI> p. 93.</BIBL></P>

<P>M. BRIDAINE, the man, who, in the pre|&s;ent age, is the mo&s;t ju&s;tly celebrated in this way, was born with a popular Eloquence, abounding with metaphorical and &s;triking
<PB N="65" REF="032455_0076_0FF269B11F5604B8">expre&s;&s;ions; and no one ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a higher degree, the rare talent of arre&s;ting the attention of an a&s;&s;embled multitude.</P>
<P>HE had &s;o fine a voice, as to render cradi|ble all the wonders which hi&s;tory relates of the declamation of the ancients, for he was as ea&s;ily heard by ten thou&s;and people in the open fields, as if he had &s;poken under the mo&s;t re&s;ounding arch. In all he &s;aid, there were ob&s;ervable unexpected &s;trokes of Orato|ry, the bolde&s;t metaphors, thoughts &s;udden, new, and &s;triking, all the marks of a rich im|agination, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ometimes even whole di&s;cour&s;es, compo&s;ed with care, and written with an equal combination of ta&s;te and animation.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER to have heard him deliver the introduction of the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e which he preached in the Church of St. Sulpice, in 1751. The fir&s;t company in the capital went, out of curio&s;ity, to hear him.</P>
<P>BRIDAINE perceived among the congrega|tion many Bi&s;hops, and per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, as well as a va&s;t number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. This &s;ight, far from intimidating, &s;ugge&s;ted to him the following exordium, &s;o far at lea&s;t as my memory remains, of a pa&s;&s;age, with which I have been always &s;en&s;ibly affected, and, which, perhaps, will not appear unwor|thy of Bo&s;&s;uet, or Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032455_0077_0FF26A81FB0567D0">
<Q>AT the &s;ight of an Auditory &s;o new to me, methinks, my brethren, I ought only to open my mouth to &s;olicit your favour in behalf of a poor mi&s;&s;ionary, de&s;titute of all tho&s;e talents which you require of tho&s;e who &s;peak to you about your &s;alvation. Neverthele&s;s, I experience to-day, a feeling very different. And, if I am ca&s;t down, &s;u&s;pect me not of being depre&s;&s;ed by the wretchech unca&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned by vanity, as if I were accu&s;tomed to preach my&s;elf. God forbid that a mini&s;ter of Heaven &s;hould ever &s;uppo&s;e he needed an excu&s;e with you! for, whoever ye may be, ye are all of you &s;inners like my&s;elf. It is before your God and mine, that I feel my&s;elf impelled at this moment to &s;trike my brea&s;t. UNTIL now, I have proclaimed the right|eou&s;ne&s;s of the Mo&s;t High in Churches covered with thatch. I have preached the rigours of penance to the unfortunate who wanted bread. I have declared to the good inhabitants of the country the mo&s;t awful truths of my religion. Unhappy man! what have I done? I have made &s;ad the poor, the be&s;t friends of my God! I have conveyed terror and grief into tho&s;e &s;imple and hone&s;t &s;ouls, whom I ought to have pitied and con&s;oled! It is here only where I behold the great, the rich, the op|pre&s;&s;ors
<PB N="67" REF="032455_0078_0FF26AB0A8019F78">of &s;uffering humanity, or &s;inners daring and hardened. Ah! it is here only where the &s;acred word &s;hould be made to re&s;ound with all the force of its thunder; and where I &s;hould place with me in this pulpit, on the one &s;ide, Death which threat|ens you, and on the other, my great God, who is about to judge you. I hold to-day your &s;entence in my hand. Tremble then in my pre&s;ence, ye proud and di&s;dainful men who hear me! The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;alva|tion, the certainty of death, the uncertainty of that hour, &s;o terrifying to you, final im|penitence, the ju&s;t judgment, the number of the elect, hell, and above all, Eternity! Eter|nity! The&s;e are the &s;ubjects upon which I am come to di&s;cour&s;e, and which I ought, doubt|le&s;s, to have re&s;erved for you alone. Ah! what need have I of your commendation, which, perhaps, might damn me, without &s;aving you? God is about to rou&s;e you, while his unworthy mini&s;ter &s;peaks to you! for I have had a long experience of his mercies. Penetrated with a dete&s;tation of your pa&s;t iniquities, and &s;hedding tears of &s;orrow and repentance, you will, then, throw your|&s;elves into my arms; and, by this remor&s;e, you will prove that I am &s;ufficiently elo|quent.</Q></P>
<P>WHO doth not, by this time, perceive, how much this Eloquence excels the frigid
<PB N="68" REF="032455_0079_0FF269B942A05148">and mi&s;erable preten&s;ions of modern wit? In apologizing, &s;o to &s;peak, for having preached upon hell in the villages, Bridaine boldly a&s;&s;umed all the authority over his auditory, which belonged to his office, and prepared their hearts for the awful truths, which he intended to announce. This Exordium alone gave him a right to &s;ay every thing. Many per&s;ons &s;till remember his &s;ermon on Eterni|ty, and the terror which he diffu&s;ed through|out the congregation, whil&s;t blending, as was usual with him, quaint compari&s;ons with &s;ub|lime tran&s;ports, he exclaimed, <Q>What foun|dation, my brethren, have you for &s;uppo&s;|ing your dying day at &s;uch a di&s;tance? Is it your youth? 'Yes', you an&s;wer; 'I am, as yet, but twenty, but thirty'. Sirs, it is not you who are twenty or thirty years old, it is death which has already advanced twenty or thirty years towards you. Ob|&s;erve: Eternity approaches. Do you know what this Eternity is? It is a pendulum who&s;e vibration &s;ays continually, Always &mdash;Ever&mdash;Ever&mdash;Always&mdash;Always! In the mean while, a reprobate cries out, 'What o'clock is it? And the &s;ame voice an&s;wers, Eternity.</Q></P>
<P>THE thundering voice of Bridaine, added, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, a new energy to his Elo|quence; and the Auditory, familiarized to
<PB N="69" REF="032455_0080_0FF2697B1621E4C0">his language and ideas, appeared at &s;uch times in di&s;may before him. The profound &s;ilence which reigned in the congregation, e&s;pecially when he preached until the ap|proach of night, was interrupted from time to time, and in a manner very perceptible, by the long and mournful &s;ighs, which proceed|ed, all at once, from every corner of the Church where he was &s;peaking.</P>
<P>ORATORS! ye who are wholly engro&s;&s;ed about your own reputation, fall at the feet of this apo&s;tolic man, and learn from a mi&s;&s;ion|ary, wherein true Eloquence con&s;i&s;ts.

<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;ort of popular Elo|quence is infallible, when there is unit|ed a voice &s;ufficiently &s;trong to maintain its

<P>HENCE we draw this conclu&s;ion, that it is a great error to di&s;card, from the go&s;pel mini&s;|try, tho&s;e awful &s;ubjects, which enkindle the imagination of the Preacher, while they tend to arou&s;e every con&s;cience. Be&s;ides that re|ligion is founded upon tho&s;e awful truths, which its mini&s;ters ought not to conceal, and which men are afraid to hear, in proportion to their tendency to produce a conver&s;ion. I know no &s;ubjects which give a more ample &s;cope to the art of Oratory.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Orator, who is above enrich|ing his compo&s;itions with them, renounces his greate&s;t advantages.</P>
<P>BUT, while we pre&s;ent the&s;e objects of ter|ror, we cannot be too &s;trongly convinced that it would be better to leave &s;inners in &s;upine|ne&s;s than to drive them to de&s;pair; that this is not &s;o much to reach the end as to exceed all bounds; that the go&s;pel is a law of love, and not a code of wrath; that men are nat|urally &s;o weak that their faults ought to excite more compa&s;&s;ion than anger; that a Preacher is not the mini&s;ter of the vengeance of Heaven, but the di&s;pen&s;er of its mercies; that in&s;tead of repelling &s;inners, it is proper to affect, to win, to reclaim them through fear to love; and to attemper the rigour of the law with the
<PB N="71" REF="032455_0082_0FF26AB2638E0148">attraction of the rewards of the go&s;pel. Yes; it would be doubtle&s;s too &s;evere, only to an|nounce threatenings to men, who need con|tinually to be encouraged and con&s;oled.</P>
<P>MAKE choice of affecting &s;ubjects, which lay hold of, and intere&s;t, the man and the Chri&s;tian. Be &s;erupulous about choo&s;ing tho&s;e confined &s;ubjects, which circum&s;cribe the Orator within too narrow bounds, which are connected with no moral precept, or which make a part of all di&s;cour&s;es on morality. Avoid frivolous &s;ubjects, who&s;e &s;urface ap|pears &s;howy, but which when we attempt to &s;earch into them, only pre&s;ent us with par|ticulars too in&s;ignificant and &s;lender for Elo|quence; &s;uch as treat of matters of decorum rather than of duty; &s;uch as &s;ugge&s;t materi|als for a letter rather than grounds for a &s;er|mon. Avoid quaint &s;ubjects, which are im|proper for the multitude, merely &s;erving the Orator him&s;elf for a pompous declamation, in which the human heart can take no intere&s;t; philo&s;ophical and ab&s;tract &s;ubjects, equally remote from religion and Eloquence, and more adapted to the Portico or the Lyceum, than to the Go&s;pel pulpit; tho&s;e &s;ubjects, in a word, which, though they may have the ap|pearance of being novel and animating, are really far-fetched and affected, and, in which, a di&s;covery is made, not &s;o much of genius, as of the want of it.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="032455_0083_0FF26A8DDD746F90">
MANY good &s;ubjects &s;till remain for Chri&s;|tian Orators to invent or revive. But then is no need to &s;earch for them, when they do not Happen to pre&s;ent them&s;elves naturally to the mind, as by an involuntary in&s;piration.</P>
<P>BEGIN with &s;tudying the prevailing best of your genius; and, after having tried your &s;trength on different &s;ubjects of argument, imagination, or &s;entiment, con&s;tantly follow that &s;ort, which is mo&s;t peculiarly your own, and which nature it&s;elf hath de&s;tined for you.</P>
<P>BE not afraid of going in beaten tracks. A fertile Orator always di&s;covers new trea|&s;ures in old mines. Wherefore &s;hould we he&s;itate to enter afre&s;h upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects which have been already &s;ucce&s;sfully hand|led? It is becau&s;e our great ma&s;ters have laid hold of all their mo&s;t &s;triking beauties, and that in draining tho&s;e fields, formerly &s;o fruit|ful, they have changed them into barren de|&s;erts?</P>
<P>LET us here be candid. If we were unac|quainted with tho&s;e lucid plans, tho&s;e original ideas, which we &s;o ju&s;tly admire in their writ|ings, &s;hould we have conceived them of our|&s;elves?

<P>IF Bo&s;&s;uet, Bourdaloue, Ma&s;iillon, were to return upon earth, think we, that their genius
<PB N="73" REF="032455_0084_0FF26AB89E20B138">would be &s;o fettered by their former ma&s;terly performances, as to be incapable of fre&s;h productions? or that the&s;e immortal Orators would not, even at this day, have been equal to them&s;elves?

<P>IT is when compo&s;ing the&s;e &s;acred eulogies that we ought e&s;pecially to keep in view this di&s;tingui&s;hed maxim of Boileau, "Nothing is beautiful but truth."</P>
<P>IT is allowable to embelli&s;h facts by com|pari&s;ons, or by contra&s;ts, provided that we confine our&s;elves to tho&s;e innocent artifices of Eloquence; but it is ridiculous to pretend a fal&s;e admiration, which every one &s;ees through, and in which no one participates.</P>
<P>INDETERMINATE commendations, common places, accumulated epithets, deceitful adula|tions, di&s;gu&s;tful exaggerations, di&s;cover igno|rance or knavery, and at once de&s;troy the con|fidence of the auditory.</P>
<P>LET the Orator, then, always reflect that he is placed in the Pulpit of truth; that he is &s;urrounded with a number of intelligent hearers; that that which cea&s;es to be probable is revolting; that the public opinion is never impo&s;ed on with impunity; and that extrav|agant compliments deba&s;e him who be&s;tows

<P>WHEN the &s;ubject of a panegyric is fertile in events, the moral ought to ari&s;e out of the hi&s;torical narrative, without &s;mothering, it un|der a heap of reflections which occur to every auditor. A method too didactic would be injurious to the di&s;cour&s;e, by impeding its rapidity.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXI. <HI>Of S. Vincent de Paul.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF all the &s;ubjects of Panegyric, which the modern hi&s;tory of religion affords us, the be&s;t, in my opinion, is the eulogy of S. VINCENT DE PAUL; a man of great virtue, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of but little renown; the be&s;t citizen whom France hath had; the Apo&s;tle of humanity, who, after having been a &s;hep|herd in his childhood, hath left in his country e&s;tabli&s;hments of more utility to the unfortu|nate, than the fine&s;t monuments of his &s;ove|reign, Louis XIV.</P>
<P>HE was, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a &s;lave at Tunis, Pre|ceptor of the Cardinal de Retz, Mini&s;ter of a village, Chaplain-General of the galleys, Prin|cipal of a college, Chief of the mi&s;&s;ions, and Joint-Commi&s;&s;ioner of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Benefi|ces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adjoint au mini&s;t&egrave;re de la feuille des Be&aacute;ne&aacute;fices.</NOTE> He in&s;tituted, in France, the Semina|ries
<PB N="81" REF="032455_0092_0FF2696B4A947B18">of the Lazari&s;ts, and of the Daughters of Charity, who devote them&s;elves to the con&s;o|lation of the unfortunate, and who &s;carcely ever change their condition, although their vows only bind them for a year. He endowed ho&s;pitals for foundlings, for orphans, for the in&s;ane, for galley-&s;laves, and for old men. His generous compa&s;&s;ion reached all kinds of wretchedne&s;s, with which the human &s;pecies is oppre&s;&s;ed, and monuments of his benefi|cence are to be found throughout all the provinces of the kingdom. When reading his life, we remark, that nothing does more honour to religion, than the hi&s;tory of in&s;titu|tions formed in favour of humanity, when humanity is beholden for them to the mini&s;|ters of the altars. Whil&s;t kings, armed again&s;t each other, ravage the earth already laid wa&s;te by other &s;courges. Vincent de Paul, the &s;on of a hu&s;bandman of Ga&s;cony, repaired the public calamities, and di&s;tributed more than twenty millions of livres in Champagne, in Picardy, in Lorraine, in Artois, where the inhabitants of whole villages were dying through want, and were afterwards left in the fields without burial, until he undertook to defray the expen&s;es of interment. He di&s;|charged, for &s;ome time, an office of zeal and charity towards the gallies. He &s;aw, one day, a wretched galley-&s;lave, who had been con|demned to three years confinement for &s;mug|gling,
<PB N="82" REF="032455_0093_0FF26A9D40902A40">and who appeared incon&s;olable on ac|count of his wife and children having been left in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Vincent de Paul &s;en&s;ibly affected with his &s;ituation, offered to put him&s;elf in his &s;tead, and, what doubtle&s;s will &s;carcely be credited, the exchange was accepted. This virtuous man was chained among the crew of galley-&s;laves, and his &s;ent continued to be &s;wollen during the remainder of his life, from the weight of tho&s;e honour|able irons which he had borne.</P>
<P>IT is evident how much an action like this is capable of &s;ugge&s;ting to the mind of an Orator; and that he would be unworthy or his profe&s;&s;ion, if he related it without excit|ing tears.</P>
<P>WHEN this great man came to Paris, found|lings were &s;old in the &s;treet of St. Landry for twenty &s;ous a piece; and the charge of the&s;e innocent creatures was committed, out of charity, as was reported, to di&s;ea&s;ed women, from whom they &s;ucked corrupted milk.</P>
<P>THESE infants whom Government aban|doned to public compa&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t all peri&s;h|ed; and &s;uch as happened to e&s;cape &s;o many dangers were introduced clande&s;tinely into opulent families, in order to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the legitimate heirs. This, for more than a cen|tury, was a never-failing &s;ource of litigation, the particulars of which are to be found in
<PB N="83" REF="032455_0094_0FF26ABC5D842700">the compilation of our old lawyers. Vincent de Paul at once provided funds for the main|tainance of twelve of the&s;e children. His charity was &s;oon extended to the relief of all tho&s;e who were left expo&s;ed at the doors of the churches. But that unu&s;ual zeal, which always gives life to a new in&s;titution, having cooled, the re&s;ources entirely failed, and fre&s;h outrages were renewed on humanity.</P>
<P>VINCENT DE PAUL was not di&s;couraged. He convoked an extraordinary a&s;&s;embly. He cau&s;ed a number of tho&s;e wretched infants to be placed in the church; and forthwith mounting the pulpit, he pronounced, with his eyes bathed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, that di&s;cour&s;e&punc; which doth as much honour to his piety as his Elo|quence, and which I faithfully tran&s;cribe from the hi&s;tory of his life, drawn up by M. Abelly, Bi&s;hop of Rhodes.</P>
<P><Q>COMPASSION and charity have a&s;&s;uredly induced you, Ladies, to adopt the&s;e little creatures for your children. You have been their mothers by kindne&s;s, &s;ince their moth|ers by nature have for&s;aken them. See, now, whether ye al&s;o are willing to abandon them. Cea&s;e, for the pre&s;ent, to be their mothers, that ye may become their judges. Their life and their death are in your hands. I am going to put it to the vote, and to take the &s;uffrages.

<P>SIGHS were the only an&s;wer to this pathetic exhortation: and the &s;ame day, in the &s;ame church, at that very time, the Foundling Ho&s;pital at Paris was founded and endowed with a revenue of forty thou&s;and livres.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ucce&s;s attending this di&s;cour&s;e of Vincent de Paul, in the erection of the Foundling Ho&s;pital at Paris, is el&s;ewhere (&sect; 48) compared to that of the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter's &s;ermon, which in|fluenced the public benevolence to found an Ho&s;pital for Inocula|tion in London; and hence our author is led to remark, that "Eloquence could not obtain a more excellent triumph." In ad|dition to the&s;e two in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;ful di&s;cour&s;e, it may be added, that, in con&s;equence of Bi&s;hop Ridley's &s;ermon on alms, King Edward the Sixth founded St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital for the &s;ick and wounded, Bridewell for the wilfully idle and mad, and Chri&s;t Church for orphan. <BIBL>BURNETT'S <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Re|formation.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>

<P>THE misfortune of S. Vincent de Paul (if it be one to be little prai&s;ed, and even little known,) was not to be celebrated, when he died in 1661, by that eloquent Bo&s;&s;uet who immortalized all his heroes, and who, at the

<P>IT is common in Panegyrics, or in funeral Orations, for Orators to &s;ketch the por|traiture of contemporaries who have been the rivals or antagoni&s;ts of the man who&s;e virtues are prai&s;ed.

<P>WHEN Ma&s;&s;illon preached to the Nuns of Chilot, in the pre&s;ence of the Queen of Eng|land, he drew the picture of the Prince of Orange, to plea&s;e the con&s;ort of King James; but his genius rendered him no &s;ervice on this occa&s;ion.

<P><PB N="87" REF="032455_0098_0FF26ABE26594E78">
HIS amplification was more adapted to con&s;ole the Queen of England, than to de|&s;cribe the Prince of Orange. It may &s;erve for an illu&s;tration of the fact, that Ma&s;&s;illon enlarged too much on the &s;ame idea, and ex|tremely mi&s;applied his fluency of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I MEAN to &s;peak of COMPLIMENTS, with which we are &s;ometimes led to begin, or fini&s;h, our pulpit di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>ESTABLISHED u&s;age no longer permits the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel to preach the &s;acred word before the rulers of the world, without burning at their feet &s;ome grains of incen&s;e. Kings are, therefore, much to be pitied, who
<PB N="89" REF="032455_0100_0FF26B8C00A6EA78">are pur&s;ued with flattery in tho&s;e very Church|es, where they come to learn their duty, and to be humbled for their faults: but it is, al&s;o, to be regretted, that Chri&s;tian Orators, who ought then to &s;peak as the con&s;cience of the guilty, &s;hould degrade them&s;elves to a level with a crowd of flatterers. What mu&s;t doubt|le&s;s comfort them, is, the a&s;&s;urance that com|mendations enjoined upon the man who offers them, cannot dazzle the great, to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>LET no one, however, exceed the bounds of ju&s;t prai&s;e; for religion doth not permit it any farther than is con&s;i&s;tent with truth.</P>
<P>LET us ever recognize an Apo&s;tle as an enemy to fal&s;ehood, even in tho&s;e Compli|ments wherein one might &s;o often &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf freed from the obligation of &s;incerity. Let us not bring a mini&s;try, divinely com|mi&s;&s;ioned, into contempt, by e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ggerated eulogiums, which can never impo&s;e, either upon the Great who de&s;pi&s;e them, upon the Orator who pronounces them, upon the Auditor who hears them, or upon God, who forms a ju&s;t judgment concerning them.</P>
<P>ADULATION always di&s;plea&s;es. <Q>To prai&s;e Princes for virtues which they have not,</Q> &s;ays the Duke de Rochefoucauld, <Q>is to in&s;ult

<P>EUSEBIUS, in "the life of Con&s;tantine,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">B. iv. chap. 4.</NOTE> relates, that this Emperor impo&s;ed &s;ilence upon a preacher, who was ba&s;e enough to imitate, in his &s;ermon, the fiction of Virgil re&s;pecting the Apotheo&s;is of Augu&s;tus, by telling Con&s;tantine, that, after his death, he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ociated with the Son of God in the government of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>I ADMIRE in Bo&s;&s;uet, that noble and manly freedom, which he always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, through &s;ear of flattery. We di&s;cern, in his Compli|ments, a certain apo&s;tolic &s;everity, and a marked di&s;like of adulation.</P>
<P>HAD an indifferent per&s;on been nominated to prai&s;e Madam de la Valliere, for entering into a religious order, in the pre&s;ence of Queen Maria There&s;a, he would not have declined &s;uch an opportunity of extolling the virtues of the con&s;ort of Louis XIV.</P>
<P>"IT is proper", &s;aid Bo&s;&s;uet to her, <Q>it is fit, Madam, that as you form by your rank &s;o con&s;iderable a part of worldly grandeur, you &s;hould &s;ometimes join in ceremonies, wherein we learn to undervalue it.</Q> The Orator then recals his &s;ubject, and thinks no more of the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="032455_0102_0FF26B3D44872630">
FENELON never weakened, in his preach|ing, the force of the &s;acred maxims, which he hath recorded in Telemachus again&s;t flatterers.</P>
<P>ONE &s;ingle Compliment of this kind is alone extant. It is to be found towards the conclu&s;ion of the di&s;cour&s;e, which he deliv|ered at the Con&s;ecration of the Elector of Cologne. That pa&s;&s;age is alike worthy of Fenelon, by its di&s;tingui&s;hed moderation, as well as by the rhetorical expre&s;&s;ion, which he makes u&s;e of, to ju&s;tify the re&s;ervedne&s;s of his eulogium.</P>
<P><Q>YOU have ju&s;t heard, my brethren, all that I have &s;aid to this Prince. What have I not dared to &s;ay to him? And what ought I not to be bold to &s;ay to him, &s;ince his only fear is not to know the truth? The greate&s;t prai&s;e would do him infinitely le&s;s honour, than the epi&s;copal liberty with which he wi&s;hes me to addre&s;s him.</Q></P>
<P>IT is difficult to adopt a direct addre&s;s in Compliments, without appearing either to exaggerate, or to have an uniformity of &s;tyle, and al&s;o without embarra&s;&s;ing the per&s;on too much, whom we mean to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is preferable to include them in a para|phra&s;e of the holy &s;criptures, or in prayer to God, or in an apo&s;trophe addre&s;&s;ed to the auditory.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="032455_0103_0FF26B18119D0C68">
BUT, whatever be the mode of expre&s;&s;ion that we &s;elect, the Compliment delivered mu&s;t be connected with the &s;ubject under di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion; common places, which characterize no one, mu&s;t be avoided; in&s;truction mu&s;t be blended with prai&s;e, or, rather, be made to proceed out of the prai&s;e it&s;elf; we mu&s;t con|fine our&s;elves to a &s;mall number of lively and &s;triking ideas; and endeavour to conclude with a pa&s;&s;age happily expre&s;&s;ed, and ea&s;ily remembered.</P>
<P>BOURDALOUE never excelled in this arti|cle. All his compliments are trivial. In the &s;ermon he preached at Ver&s;ailles, two days after the marriage of the Duke of Bourbon, &s;on of the great Dauphin, with Adelaide of Savoy, he repeated, towards his conclu&s;ion, a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, the application of which forcibly &s;truck the auditory. Some e&s;teemed it a very happy allu&s;ion, while others were of opinion, that it degenerated into a play of words.</P>
<P>AFTER a very in&s;tructive eulogium, Bour|daloue &s;peaks, in the&s;e terms, of the young Prince&s;s:</P>
<P><Q>THERE is that, which, in my e&s;timation, renders her more re&s;pectable than her rank, and which induces me to &s;ay as Eliezer, the &s;ervant of Abraham, when, beholding for the fir&s;t time the &s;pou&s;e of the &s;on of his

<P>IF drawing of characters and compliments be excepted, in which the Orator may &s;ometimes de&s;cend, without degradation, to the &s;parkling efforts of wit, a manly energy, of which &s;olidity con&s;titutes the beauty, &s;hould enliven all the members of his di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>WHENEVER he addre&s;&s;es an a&s;&s;embly, he &s;hould affect them, for the language of the pa&s;&s;ions is that alone which &s;trike the multi|tude.</P>
<P>I HAVE often remarked, that, in the read|ing &s;ocieties which are formed in the country, eloquent works are cho&s;en in preference to tho&s;e of in&s;truction. Truth &s;atisfies the mind of a &s;olitary reader; but no &s;ooner doth he unite with others than he wi&s;hes to be affect|ed; and writings, otherwi&s;e excellent, cea&s;e to plea&s;e, when they undergo the formidable experiment of being read aloud.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="032455_0105_0FF26AFFE3031E98">
ATTEMPT not, then, to write a book, when you are compo&s;ing a &s;ermon. Guard again&s;t ever adopting the languid trammels of a wri|ter, who &s;peaks from his pen, or his paper, while I &s;hould be attending to his di&s;cour&s;e as the in&s;piration of the moment.</P>
<P>ARE you de&s;irous that your Eloquence may be animated? Sub&s;titute for the languor of a continued di&s;cour&s;e, the liveline&s;s of an immediate addre&s;s. Conver&s;e continually with your hearers. In&s;tead of wandering in ab&s;tract contemplations, as if you were meditating in &s;olitude, &s;peak to that numerous a&s;&s;embly, which gathers around to hear you.</P>
<P>YOU will find a very good example of this direct addre&s;s, in <Q>the familiar in&s;truction of Ma&s;&s;illon, upon the ceremony of Ab&s;o|lution:</Q> an admirable exhortation, which, bears no re&s;emblance to any of his other di&s;|cour&s;es, and, in which, each expre&s;&s;ion is a dart thrown by the Orator, transfixing the hearts of his Auditory!</P>
<P>To &s;peak to the hearers is not &s;ufficient. It is al&s;o requi&s;ite to make them &s;peak them|&s;elves, and to add to the variegated charms of an immediate addre&s;s, the never failing and increa&s;ing effect of Dialogue.</P>
<P>THE ancients di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, in Dialogues, the mo&s;t philo&s;ophic &s;ubjects. The&s;e men, who
<PB N="95" REF="032455_0106_0FF26B8FCEB5BF40">knew &s;o well how to imitate nature, did not compo&s;e inanimate books, when they meant to unfold the ideas which they had collected in their meditations. They approached to the manner of the drama. They placed, upon the &s;tage, &s;ome friends, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e conver&s;ations they reported. They thus di&s;cu&s;&s;ed various oppo&s;ite opinions, with an equal mixture of wi&s;dom and urbanity. They made choice of each reader for a judge; and hence it is, that they have diffu&s;ed over the writings of anti|quity, all that delight, which is experienced while attending to the conver&s;ation of a &s;elect number of intelligent gue&s;ts, who mutually impart each other's thoughts, in the agreeable freedom of an entertainment.</P>
<P>IF, by this mode of Dialogue, Plato and Cicero have &s;ucceeded in enlivening meta|phy&s;ical &s;ubjects, how much greater impul&s;e and life would it not impart to Eloquence?</P>
<P>IN Oratory, Dialogue &s;upplies the place of alternate &s;peakers, breaks the monotony, gives &s;trength to the argument, and in&s;pires confidence, provided the Orator does not weaken tho&s;e difficulties which he ought to propo&s;e to him&s;elf; for, if the hearer can render the objections more forcible than the Orator, he will no longer attend to his an|&s;wers.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="032455_0107_0FF26B4C5AD199C0">
BESIDES, nothing is better calculated for reviving the attention, than tho&s;e &s;u&s;pen&s;ions, properly managed, which cau&s;e the hearers to fluctuate in a kind of uncertainty, proceeding at fir&s;t from an emotion of &s;urpri&s;e, when the Orator &s;tarts objections to him&s;elf, which he afterwards converts into curio&s;ity, when he refutes them.</P>
<P>I AM often delighted with tho&s;e cogent que&s;tions in the Di&s;cour&s;es of MASSILLON, which engage the attention of the hearers, at the very moment when they might be apt to withdraw it.</P>
<P>AN example of this &s;ort occurs in his &s;er|mon "on the mixture of the righteous and the wicked."</P>
<P><Q>THE righteous deprive iniquity of every excu&s;e. Do you &s;ay that you have done no more than to follow e&s;tabli&s;hed prece|dents? But have the righteous, who are among you, conformed to them? Do you plead the unavoidable con&s;equences of illu&s;trious de&s;cent? You know &s;ome, who, with a name &s;till more di&s;tingui&s;hed than your own, impart &s;anctity to &s;plendor. Do you plead the vivacity of your years?&mdash;the weakne&s;s of your &s;ex? Every day will &s;hew you &s;ome, who, in the bloom of youth, and with all the talents &s;uited to this world,
<PB N="97" REF="032455_0108_0FF26B921BCEF520">have their minds &s;upremely bent on Heav|en. Is it the di&s;traction of bu&s;ine&s;s? You may &s;ee tho&s;e engaged in the &s;ame cares with your&s;elf, who, notwith&s;tanding, make &s;alvation their principal concern. Is plea|&s;ure your delight? Plea&s;ure is the fir&s;t de&s;ire of all men, and of the righteous, in &s;ome of whom it is even &s;tronger, and who&s;e natural di&s;po&s;itions are le&s;s favourable to virtue, than in you.

The ancient Greek and Roman Writers abounded in this method of compo&s;ition. Among others, PLATO, LUCIAN, CICERO, MACROBIUS, the author of the <HI>Dialogue concerning the Cau&s;es of the Corruption of Eloquence</HI> (a&s;cribed by &s;ome to Tacitus, and by others to Quintilian;) AESCHINES, SOCRATICUS, MINUTIUS, FELIX, XENOPHON,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">XENOPLION may, without much impropriety, be called a Dialogue-writer; for, though his writings are not in the direct form of Dialogue, yet he continually makes his characters &s;peak in their own language. HOMER, al&s;o, abounds in this form of Dialogue.
<P>Various in&s;tances of the &s;ame &s;ort may be traced &s;o early as in the writings of MOSES, and the Prophets, as well as in tho&s;e of the Evangeli&s;ts. Such are the&s;e; I&s;a. xlix. 14, 15: <Q>But Zion &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the Lord hath for&s;aken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her &s;ucking child, that &s;he &s;hould not have compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;on of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." Rom. vi. 1: "What &s;hall we &s;ay then? Shall we continue in &s;in that grace may abound?

<P>Dr. WARD ob&s;erves, that <Q>this method &s;eems to be attended with very con&s;iderable advantages, if well and judiciou&s;ly man|aged. For it is capable to make the drie&s;t &s;ubjects entertaining and plea&s;ant, by its variety, and the different characters of the &s;peakers. Be&s;ides&punc; things may be canva&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more minutely, and many le&s;&s;er matters, which &s;eem to clear up a &s;ubject may be introduced with a better grace by que&s;tions and an&s;wers, objec|tions and replies, than can be conveniently done in continued di&s;cour&s;e. There is likewi&s;e a farther advantage in this way of writing, that the author is at liberty to choo&s;e his &s;peakers. And, therefore, as Cicero has well ob&s;erved, when we imagine that we hear per&s;ons of an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation for wi&s;dom and knowledge talking together, it nece&s;&s;arily adds a weight and authority to the di&s;cour&s;e,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Amic, c. 1.</NOTE> and more clo&s;ely engages the at|tention.

<P>Dr. BLAIR el&s;ewhere &s;ays, <Q>There is a &s;till higher degree of Eloquence, wherein a greater power is exerted over the human mind; by which we are not only convinced, but intere&s;ted, agitated, and carried along with the &s;peaker; our pa&s;&s;ions are made to ri&s;e together with his; we enter into all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notions; we love, we dete&s;t, we re&s;ent, according as he in&s;pires us; and are prompted to re&s;olve, or to act, with vigour and warmth. Such high Eloquence is always the offspring of pa&s;&s;ion. By pa&s;|&s;ion, I mean that &s;tate of the mind in which it is agitated and fired, by &s;ome object it has in view. A man may convince, and even per&s;uade others to act, by mere rea&s;on and argument.

<P>CHRISTIAN Orators, do you, your&s;elves, era&s;e &s;uch di&s;gu&s;ting pleona&s;ms. Pa&s;s a critical judgment upon your productions, and, together with &s;uch in&s;ignificant expre&s;|&s;ions, bani&s;h all tho&s;e negligencies of &s;tyle, which degrade the &s;ublimity of the ideas.</P>
<P>IT is not required that the whole of a &s;er|mon &s;hould be equally &s;triking; but it is requi&s;ite that it be all equally well written, and that Eloquence make amends, by the beauty of the expre&s;&s;ion, for the quality of the thoughts when they are ordinary; ju&s;t as &s;culpture adds, by the richne&s;s of the drapery, to the elegance of the figures.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t allow pau&s;es for admiration. This is chiefly nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of energy. If, therefore, it be remarked that there are many very eloquent pa&s;&s;ages in a &s;ermon
<PB N="106" REF="032455_0117_0FF26B5376345BA8">compo&s;ed with care, and containing forcible arguments, the prai&s;e will be &s;ufficient; &s;ince there is none as yet extant, which is in all re&s;pects perfect.</P>
<P>Is the merit of a pure and elegant &s;tyle your ambition? Multiply the copies of your di&s;cour&s;es, and cea&s;e not to tran&s;cribe your performance until you are able to afford &s;atisfaction to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>AN Orator ought to adopt the motto of Cae&s;ar, who <Q>thought that he had done nothing, while there remained any thing for him to do.</Q> The more he writes, the better he writes; and it is only by &s;urmount|ing the tediou&s;ne&s;s of reiterated tran&s;criptions, that he can di&s;play in his &s;tyle all the elegance of his ta&s;te.</P>
<P>HENCE it is, that very few men of learning employ all their powers to advantage. The greater part, being accu&s;tomed to re&s;t too &s;oon contented, die without ever having known the extent of their own talents.</P>
<P>FRESH ideas, the beauties of enlargement, the exqui&s;ite &s;entiment of a fini&s;hed pa&s;&s;age, which Horace &s;o well defined and reli&s;hed when he called it, <HI>qui me mihi reddat amicum;</HI> in a word, the elegant and variegated turns of expre&s;&s;ion, which compo&s;e the beauty of &s;tyle, do not occur to a writer in the fir&s;t ca&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="032455_0118_0FF26B9E4F5A1978">of a work, and are generally the effect of a &s;low correction.</P>
<P>WHILE there remains room to alter. there is opportunity for improvement. It is the characteri&s;tic of excellence in all the arts, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly to &s;trike the &s;pectator who admires it, that he can conceive of nothing tran&s;cending that which he beholds.</P>
<P>HOWEVER little we may have accu&s;tomed our&s;elves to write, we ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which have not been &s;ufficiently &s;tudied, and which proceeded from the pen of the writer, before they had been thoroughly dige&s;ted in his own mind. This ha&s;ty or negligent compo&s;ition &s;oon di&s;covers it&s;elf, not, as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, by the plea&s;ing freedom of a diction &s;omewhat too unre&s;train|ed and irregular, but by the confu&s;ion of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, all the con&s;tituent parts of which are &s;tiff and forced.</P>
<P>THE more the writer hurries him&s;elf, the more dragging, of cour&s;e, is his &s;tyle. And, when it is &s;aid that a writing "&s;mells of the lamp," it is an evident proof that it is not &s;ufficiently laboured.</P>

<P>MASSILLON knew al&s;o, this &s;ecret of the art. In his writings, a word, which &s;eemed to de|clare a paradox, often expre&s;&s;ed a new thought, and a very weighty and ju&s;t idea.

<P>Dr. WARD'S ob&s;ervations upon this point are as follow:</P>
<P><Q>There are two kinds of Order, in the con&s;truction of a &s;en|tence, one of which may be called <HI>natural,</HI> and the other <HI>arti|ficial.</HI> We call that order <HI>natural,</HI> when all the words in a &s;en|tence are &s;o placed, as they are connected with, or follow each other, in a grammatical con&s;truction. And it may properly enough admit of this name, as it is founded in the nature of a propo&s;ition, and the relation of the &s;everal words, of which it con&s;i&s;ts, to each other. And this &s;eems agreeable to the natural way of conveying our thoughts which leads us fir&s;t to expre&s;s the &s;ubject, or thing, of which &s;ome other thing is &s;aid, before the predicate, or that which is &s;aid concerning it; and with re&s;pect to both, as every idea &s;ucceeds another in the order of our con|ceptions, to range it in the &s;ame order, when we communicate them to others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our language in general keeps pretty much to this method. But in one thing, particularly, it recedes from it; and that is, in placing adjectives, which denote the properties of things, be|fore their &s;ub&s;tantives or &s;ubjects, who&s;e properties they are. As when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is &s;aid, <HI>Evil communication corrupts good manners.</HI> And this we always do, except &s;omething follows which depends upon the adjective. So we &s;ay, <HI>He was a man eminent for his virtue,</HI> not, <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent man.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Artificial order,</HI> as it re&s;pects &s;imple &s;entences, has little or no regard to the natural con&s;truction of words; but di&s;po&s;es them in &s;uch a manner, as will be mo&s;t agreeable to the ear, and be&s;t an&s;wer the de&s;ign of the &s;peaker. The Latins take a much greater liberty in this re&s;pect, than we do, or the nature of our language will permit. Quintilian &s;ays, it is be&s;t for the verb to &s;tand la&s;t, when there is no particular rea&s;on to the contra|ry; and he gives this rea&s;on for it, 'becau&s;e the force of the &s;entence lies in the verb.' They likewi&s;e &s;eparate &s;uch words as have an immediate relation between them, or depend|ance one upon another; and place any of them fir&s;t or la&s;t, as they plea&s;e. In &s;hort, their order &s;eems in a manner arbi|trary, if it does not break in upon per&s;picuity, to which they u&s;ually attend. But mo&s;t of the&s;e things are un&s;uitable to the genius of our language. The Latin tongue commonly admits of a much greater var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ety in the tran&s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion of members, as well as in that of &s;ingle words, than &s;uits with our idiom. Our com|po&s;ition is, this re&s;pect, much more limited and confined than the Latin. The natural order is certainly more plain and ea&s;y; but yet it mu&s;t be owned, that the other has its advantages, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable. The language both of the Greeks and Romans has more &s;trength, as well as harmony, than any modern tongue; which is owing, in a good mea&s;ure, to this liberty in their compo&s;ition. For by giving their periods the fine&s;t tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and placing the mo&s;t &s;ignificant words, where they may &s;trike the mind with the greate&s;t force, at the &s;ame time they both de|light the ear, and excite the attention.</Q></P> <BIBL>WARD'S <HI>Sy&s;tem of Oratory,</HI> vol. i. p. 354-364.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. BLAIR makes the following appo&s;ite remarks upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q>In the Latin language, the arrangement, which mo&s;t com|monly obtains, is, to place fir&s;t, in the &s;entence, that word which expre&s;&s;es the principal object of the di&s;cour&s;e, together with its circum&s;tances; and afterwards, the per&s;on, or the thing, that acts upon it. Thus Sallu&s;t, comparing together the mind and the body; <HI>Animi imperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">peris &s;ervitis, magis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> which order certainly renders the &s;entence more lively and &s;triking, than when it is arranged according to our Engli&s;h con&s;truction; We make mo&s;t u&s;e of the direction of the &s;oul, and of the &s;ervice of the body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Latin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination, which naturally runs fir&s;t to that which is its chief object; and, having once named it, carries it in view throughout the re&s;t of the &s;entence. In the &s;ame manner in poetry,</Q></P>
<L>Ju&s;tum et tenacem propofiti viru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</L>
<L>Non civium ardor prava jubentium,</L>
<L>Non vultus in&s;tantis tyranoi,</L>
<L>Mente quatit &s;olida.&mdash;</L>
<P><Q>Every per&s;on of ta&s;te mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that here the words are arranged with a much greater regard to the figure which the &s;everal objects make in the fancy, than our Engli&s;h con&s;truction admits; which would require the <HI>Ju&s;tum et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> propo&s;iti viru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> though undoubtedly, the capital object in the &s;entence, to be thrown into the la&s;t place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>An Engli&s;h writer, paying a compliment to a great man, would &s;ay thus: "It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to pa&s;s over, in &s;ilence, &s;uch remarkable mildne&s;s, &s;uch &s;ingular and unheard of clemency, and &s;uch unu&s;ual moderation, in the exerci&s;e of &s;upreme power." "Here, we have, fir&s;t pre&s;ented to us, the per&s;on who &s;peaks. 'It is impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>me;</HI> next, what that per&s;on is to do; impo&s;&s;ible for him <HI>to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence;'</HI> and la&s;tly, the object which moves him &s;o to do, 'the mildne&s;s, clemency, and moderation of his patron.' Cicero, from whom I have tran&s;lated the&s;e words, ju&s;t rever&s;es this order; beginning with the object, placing that fir&s;t which was the exciting idea in the &s;peaker's mind, and ending with the &s;peaker and his action. <HI>Tantum man&s;uetudinem, tame inu&s;itatam in auditamque clementia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, tantumque in &s;umma pote&s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rum c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nium modum, tacit&egrave; multo [nullo] modo praeterire po&s;&s;um.</HI></Q> <BIBL>Orat. pro Marcell.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>The Latin order is more animated; the Engli&s;h more clear and di&s;tinct. The Romans generally arranged their words ac|cording to the order in which the ideas ro&s;e in the &s;peaker's imagination. We arrange them according to the order in which the under&s;tanding directs tho&s;e ideas to be exhibited, in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, to the view of another. Our arrangement, therefore, ap|pears to be the con&s;equence of greater refinement in the art of &s;peech; as far as clearne&s;s in communication is under&s;tood to be the end of &s;peech.</Q> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 119, and 121.</BIBL></P></NOTE></P>

Such do not con&s;ider, that every di&s;cour&s;e which wants an interpreter, is a very bad one. The &s;upreme perfection of a &s;peaker's &s;tyle &s;hould be to plea&s;e the unlearned, as well as the learned, by exhibiting an abundance of graces for the latter, and being very per&s;picuous for the former. St. Au&s;tin wrote at fir&s;t again&s;t the Manichees, in a flowery and &s;ublime &s;tyle; whence his writings were unintelligible to tho&s;e who had but a moderate &s;hare of learning, at lea&s;t not without great difficulty. Upon this he was told, that if he de&s;ired to have his works more generally u&s;eful, he mu&s;t write in the plain and common &s;tyle, &s;o as to be equally intelligible to the learned and the unlearned. The holy father received this advice with his u&s;ual humility, and made prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;e of it in the books he afterwards wrote again&s;t the here|tics, and in his &s;ermons.

<P><Q>As ob&s;curity is the fault which the preacher mu&s;t chiefly avoid, and that his auditors are not allowed to interrupt him, when they meet with any thing ob&s;cure, St. Au&s;tin advi&s;es him to read in the eyes and countenances of his auditors, whether they under|&s;tand him or not; and to repeat the &s;ame, thing by giving it dif|ferent turns, till he perceives he is under&s;tood.</Q> <BIBL>ROLLIN'S <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> vol. ii. c 3, &sect; 4, p. 305&mdash;307.</BIBL></P>
<P>Dr. WARD a&s;cribes Ob&s;curity chiefly to the three following cau&s;es: Fir&s;t, all ambiguity of expre&s;&s;ion, ari&s;ing from the differ|ent &s;en&s;es in which a word is capable of being taken. Again, Ob&s;curity is occa&s;ioned either by too &s;hort and conci&s;e a manner of &s;peaking, or by &s;entences too long and prolix.

And he adds, "though the works of &s;uch may afford plea&s;ure, it is not &s;uch as re&s;ults from legitimate hi&s;tory. The writer evidently labours to di&s;play him&s;elf, and his own ingenuity: but it is one great &s;ecret in the art of writing, that the writer &s;hould keep him&s;elf out of &s;ight, and cau&s;e the ideas, which he means to convey, fully to engro&s;s the reader's attention. They cannot indeed otherwi&s;e produce their proper effect. If there are any readers, who choo&s;e to have the writer pre&s;ent to their view, rather than the matter which he writes, they may be &s;aid to re&s;emble tho&s;e &s;pectators, who go to the theatre, rather to &s;ee and hear a favourite actor, than to attend to the per&s;ons of the drama.

<P><PB N="160" REF="032455_0171_0FF26BE71E408990">
THE fir&s;t part of his di&s;cour&s;es generally con&s;i&s;ts of a commentary upon his text. In my opinion, all his critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon hi&s;tory, grammar, or chronology, are ex|tremely different from E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oquence.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the &s;hew of erudition, with which Saurin impo&s;es on &s;o many of his readers, ought not to be held of any account, even if all this &s;cientific dre&s;s were not mi&s;timed, in|a&s;much as it is no very difficult ta&s;k to copy commentators, or to tran&s;late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;&s;ertations.</P>
<P>ON this account, therefore, when you read Saurin, do not &s;top &s;hort at any of the fir&s;t parts of his di&s;cour&s;es. This manner of writ|ing, which, at the beginning of this century, was called "the Refuge&eacute; &s;tyle," has been charged again&s;t him on &s;ub&s;tantial grounds. He u&s;es a tran&s;lation of the Bible, which was made immediately after the &s;eparation of the Prote&s;tant churches; and this old language, contra&s;ted with his modern Eloquence, im|parts to his &s;tyle a &s;avage and barbarous air. I might quote examples, if his &s;ermons were not &s;o diffu&s;e.</P>
<P>SAURIN, however, writes with ardour and vehemence. He doth not make an o&s;tenta|tions &s;how of wit; he doth not lo&s;e &s;ight of his auditory; he forcibly urges his argu|ments; he knows when to in&s;i&s;t upon them; he is moved, and he inflames. He hath the

<P>No Chri&s;tian Orator, after Bo&s;&s;uet, (to whom there can be none compared when &s;peaking of Pulpit-Eloquence) hath laboured more carefully or &s;ucce&s;sfully the perorations of his di&s;cour&s;es. In them, Saurin always recalled the idea of death. This object ren|ders them as &s;olemn as they are affecting. They commonly con&s;i&s;t of repetitions; and this return of the &s;ame &s;et of expre&s;&s;ions is very proper, when making the application of a &s;ermon to the different cla&s;&s;es of hearers. It is by this figure, that he recapitulates his proofs; and then he points to the open grave, as if the li&s;tening congregation, ready to de|&s;cend into it, were not thenceforward to hear any other in&s;truction, or rather, as if he him|&s;elf were preaching for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>THE &s;ermons of Saurin, <Q>on the wi&s;dom of Solomon,</Q> and <Q>on the di&s;cour&s;e of St. Paul to Felix and Dru&s;illa,</Q> appear to me the ma&s;ter-pieces of this Orator.</P>
<P>IT is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that he never allowed him&s;elf to make u&s;e of declamations again&s;t the church of Rome; but I appre|hend that fanatici&s;m cannot break out more pa&s;&s;ionately, than in his &s;ermons on <Q>the
<PB N="162" REF="032455_0173_0FF26BEF57969300">dedication of the church of Woorburg;</Q> on "the afflictions of the church;" on "the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> incomprehen&s;ibility of God;" on <Q>the fa&s;t; ob&s;erved before the campaign of 1706.</Q></P>
<P>SAURIN is transformed. He ri&s;es to the level of Demo&s;thenes, when he &s;peaks of the emigration of the Prote&s;tants; above all, when he thunders again&s;t Louis XIV. He is never more eloquent, nor more &s;ublime, than when wa&s;ting his fury again&s;t this mon|arch, who&s;e name perpetually recurs in his di&s;cour&s;es, and, principally, in the &s;ermons, which I am about to quote.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;trophe is well known; <Q>and thou formidable Prince, whom I once hon|oured as my king, and whom I &s;till regard as the &s;courge of the Lord,</Q> &amp;c. Saurin fini&s;hes this pa&s;&s;age by &s;aying, that he for|gives Louis XIV; but he does not attempt to impre&s;s this in&s;ulting moderation on the minds of the people of Holland. It is, per|haps, in the pulpit of Saurin, where have been fabricated the arms of Hoch&s;tet, of Malpla|quet, and Ramillies; and where that impla|cable re&s;entment hath been produced, which pre&s;ided at the conferences of Gertruidemberg.</P>
<P>NEVER did an Orator conceive any thing more daring than the dialogue of Saurin be|tween God and his auditory, in his &s;ermon "on the fa&s;t of 1706." "My people," &s;aith
<PB N="163" REF="032455_0174_0FF26AF0777A4928">the mo&s;t High <Q>my people, what have I done unto thee?" "Ah, Lord! how ma|ny things ha&s;t thou done unto us!&mdash;the ways of Zion covered with mourning," &amp;c. An&s;wer, and hear witne&s;s here again&s;t the Eternal.</Q></P>
<P>THE long enumeration of the afflictions of the Prote&s;tants, which precedes the&s;e la&s;t words, gives them an energy, which cau&s;es one to tremble, at the very moment when Saurin pau&s;es, in order to vindicate the ways of Providence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Tran&s;lation of &s;elect Sermons of Saurin, by ROBINSON; in which the animated pa&s;&s;age re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erred to by M.

<P><Q>RICHARDSON, be&s;ides being a great genius, was a truly good man in all re&s;pects. He was pious, virtuous, exemplary, bene|volent, friendly, generous, and humane to an uncommon degree; glad of every opportunity of doing good offices to his fellow crea|tures in di&s;tre&s;s, and relieving many without their knowledge, His chief delight was doing good. His three great works were intitled "Pamela, or Virtue rewarded;" "The Hi&s;tory of Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe;" and "The Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on. "Dr. John&s;on &s;tyles him "an author from whom the age has received great favours, who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the pa&s;&s;ions to move at the command of virtue." Mr. Sherlock, the traveller, ob&s;erves that "Rich|ard&s;on is admirable for every &s;pecies of delicacy; for delicacy of wit, &s;entiment, language, action, every thing. His genius was immen&s;e. His views were grand. His &s;oul was noble, and his heart was excellent. He formed a plan that embraced all hu|man nature. His object was to benefit mankind. His know|ledge of the world &s;hewed him that happine&s;s was to be attained by man, only in proportion as he practi&s;ed virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Richard&s;on's reputation is far from being confined to his own country.

Maury probably refers) remarks, that, <Q>if our nation be &s;uperior to the ancients in philo|&s;ophy, we are &s;till, notwith&s;tanding all our refinements, much inferior in Eloquence. In ancient times, no work of genius was thought to require &s;o great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s and capacity, as the &s;peaking in public; and &s;ome eminent writers have pronounced the talents, even of a great poet, or philo&s;opher, to be of an inferior nature to tho&s;e requi&s;ite for &s;uch an undertaking. Greece and Rome produced, each of them, but one accompli&s;hed Orator; and whatever prai&s;es the other celebrated &s;peakers might merit, they were &s;till e&s;teemed much inferior to the&s;e great models of elo|quence.</Q>
<P><Q>Of all the polite and learned nations. Britain alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a popular government, or admits into the legi&s;lature &s;uch numer|ous a&s;&s;emblies as can be &s;uppo&s;ed to lie under the dominion of Eloquence. But what has Britain to boa&s;t of in this particular?</Q></P>
<P><Q>In enumerating the great men who have done honour to our country, we exult in our poets and philo&s;ophers; but what Ora|tors are ever mentioned? or where are the monuments of their genius to be met with? There are found, indeed, in our hi&s;tory, the names of &s;everal who directed the re&s;olutions of our parlia|ment: but neither them&s;elves nor others have taken the pains to pre&s;erve their &s;peeches; and the authority which they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;eems to have been owing to their experience, wi&s;dom, or power, more than to their talents for Oratory. At pre&s;ent, [Mr. Hume fir&s;t publi&s;hed his E&s;&s;ays about the year 1742] there are about half a dozen &s;peakers in the two hou&s;es, who, in the judgment of the public, have reached very near the &s;ame pitch of Eloquence; and no one pretends to give any one the prefer|ence to the re&s;t. This &s;eems to me a certain proof that none of them have attained much beyond a mediocrity in their art, and that the &s;pecies of Eloquence, which they a&s;pire to, gives no ex|erci&s;e to the &s;ublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached by ordinary talents, and a &s;light application. A hundred cabi|net-makers in London can work a table, or a chair, equally well; but no one poet can write ver&s;es with &s;uch &s;pirit and ele|gance as Mr. Pope.</Q></P> <BIBL>HUME'S <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> vol i.

<P>In a &s;imilar &s;train with the foregoing remarks, the judicious and acute Mr. KNOX animadverts on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Parliamenta|ry Eloquence, when, &s;peaking fir&s;t of the upper hou&s;e, he &s;ays, that <Q>it would be difficult to name a &s;ingle peer who has attracted notice or admiration for the cla&s;&s;ical elegance of his matter or his language. Of all the &s;peeches &s;poken in the hou&s;e, how few have ever been collected and pre&s;erved in libraries, as models of cla&s;&s;ical elegance? Pa&s;&s;ion and per&s;onal animo&s;ity have, indeed, produced many invectives which gratify the &s;pleen of party, and are for the time extolled beyond all the productions of preceding ingenuity. But is there extant a &s;ingle volume of &s;peeches, by the mo&s;t famous among the Orators of the upper hou&s;e, which can be produced as a cla&s;&s;ical book, or &s;tand in competition with the Orations of Cicero? I regret that the fury of party, and the meanne&s;s of &s;ervitude, have, for the mo&s;t part, excluded that true ta&s;te, true grace, and true &s;pirit, which is nece&s;&s;ary to form a cla&s;&s;ical Orator, from the harangues of an a&s;&s;embly, which may be doomed the mo&s;t augu&s;t in Europe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Hou&s;e of Commons has always been e&s;teemed a very di&s;|tingui&s;hed theatre of modern Eloquence.

But, though we join in the applau&s;e of common fame, yet let us a&s;k, where are to be found the volumes of oratorical elegance? Have the &s;peeches which have gained the prai&s;e of admiring kingdoms, been no where collected and recorded? Do we lock them up in our book-ca&s;es, and put them into the hands of our children as models for imitations, as le&s;&s;ons to form their young minds, and rai&s;e a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of orators and patriots?

<P>Dr. BLAIR joins in the &s;ame general ob&s;ervation: <Q>It &s;eems &s;urpri&s;ing that Great-Britain &s;hould not have made a more con|&s;picuous figure in Eloquence than it has hitherto attained; when we con&s;ider the enlightened, and the free and bold genius of the country. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in mo&s;t parts of Eloquence, we are undoubtedly inferior, not only to the Greeks and Ro|mans, by many degrees, but al&s;o to the French. We have phi|lo&s;ophers, hi&s;torians, and poets of the greate&s;t name; but of Ora|tors or public Speakers, how little have we to boa&s;t?

<P>From the unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect of Briti&s;h Eloquence, according to the &s;tatement of &s;uch able writers, a motive may be adduced to the young public &s;peaker to &s;ignalize him&s;elf by &s;ucce&s;sful exertions in Oratory, &s;ince the field lies &s;o open before him, and has hitherto been &s;o &s;eldom trodden.</P>
<P>"In the Hou&s;e of Commons, it is ea&s;y," &s;ays Mr. Knox, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o produce many &s;plendid examples of modern Eloquence.</Q> Sup|ported by &s;uch an authority, the tran&s;lator feels rather di&s;po&s;ed to demur at the unqualified condemnation of M.

<P>The Eloquence of the late Earl of CHATHAM hath left an inde|lible impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of many who &s;till exi&s;t, and will, doubtle&s;s, remain for ages, a glorious monument of the triumph of this art. <Q>Nations &s;hook at the thunder of his voice.

<P>It is, indeed, a &s;ubject of regret, that the &s;peeches of this great man, and of other eminent Orators, have not been more carefully pre&s;erved as models for youth, as well as for the in&s;truction of po&s;|terity at large. Some information on this &s;ubject may, however, be obtained from a late publication, intitled, <HI>Anecdotes of the Life of the Earl of Chatham, including his &s;peeches,</HI> in 2 vols. 4to.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent day, the names of &s;uch public &s;peakers as tho&s;e of PITT, FOX, SHERIDAN, and BURKE, &s;tand pre-eminent. Of Mr. Burke it may be remarked, that, perhaps there are few, if any, members of parliament, who&s;e printed &s;peeches will bear a compari&s;on with that which this Orator addre&s;&s;ed to the people of Bri&s;tol, on the occa&s;ion of a general election. We find in it that beautiful panegyric of the late Mr. Howard referred to, p. 79. The conclu&s;ion of this celebrated &s;peech has been much admired, when he &s;aid, <Q>And now, Gentlemen, on this &s;erious day, when I come, as it were, to make up my account with you; let me take to my&s;elf &s;ome degree of hone&s;t pride on the nature of the charges brought again&s;t me. I do not here &s;tand accu&s;ed of ve|nality, or neglect of duty.

It is not alleged, that, to gratify any anger or revenge of my own, or of my party, I have had a &s;hare in wronging or oppre&s;&s;ing any one man of any de&s;cription: No; the charges again&s;t me are all of one kind, that I have pu&s;hed the general principles of general ju&s;tice and benevolence too far; farther than a cautious policy would warrant, and farther than the opinions of many would go with me. In every accident which may happen through life, in pain, in &s;orrow, in depre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;tre&s;s, I will think of this accu&s;ation, and be comforted.</Q></P>
<P>But, perhaps, though the la&s;t, yet not the lea&s;t of the&s;e &s;everal Orators, of whom our nation may be proud, may be ranked the venerable Earl MANSFIELD, now, like the &s;etting &s;un, ready to di&s;appear from our view.</P>

He is &s;o filled with his &s;ubject, that he &s;eems often to be at a lo&s;s to determine which of his ideas ought to be preferred, and which omitted in his pleadings.

This was an image &s;o happy, that one might have thought he would have been &s;atisfied with it; but he was not: and &s;etting his mind again to work, he added, with great felicity, "it has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the in&s;piration."</P> <BIBL>BOSWELL'S <HI>Life of John&s;on,</HI> vol. ii. p. 361, 4to.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>

<HEAD>SECTION XLVII. <HI>Of Tillot&s;on.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Eloquence of TILLOTSON, Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, is highly e&s;teem|ed. I have read his &s;ermons with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality, and the&s;e are my &s;entiments of the works of this Prelate, who is univer&s;ally, regarded as the fir&s;t Orator of England.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="032455_0190_0FF26C3D353D0358">
TILLOTSON is an excellent writer. His principal merit con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tyle. He mu&s;t, therefore, be much injured by a tran&s;lation, in which the vernacular expre&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t, and e&s;pecially by &s;uch a tran&s;lator as Barbeyrac, who was always deficient in &s;ublimity, in embelli&s;hment, in energy, and in elegance. But, while we acknowledge all the faults of this French ver&s;ion, the &s;ubject-matter of the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury's &s;ermons &s;till re|mains far inferior to the di&s;cour&s;es of Ma&s;&s;il|lon and Bourdaloue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this acknowledgement of M. Maury, that his ideas of Tillot&s;on's &s;ermons are derived from this imperfect French ver&s;ion of Barbeyrac, it would &s;eem, that he him&s;elf has but little ac|quaintance with the Engli&s;h language; if &s;o, it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed that he is not a competent judge of Engli&s;h writers, and that, there|fore, the indi&s;criminate cen&s;ures, which he pa&s;&s;es upon our Engli&s;h divines, mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, be a&s;cribed to his own ignorance of their works, and the language in which they are written.</NOTE></P>
<P>TILLOTSON is more of a theologian than a morali&s;t. He &s;carcely ever di&s;cu&s;&s;ed any oth|er than controver&s;ial &s;ubjects. He employs the &s;ame dull modes of &s;yllogi&s;m or di&s;&s;erta|tion; and merely habituates him&s;elf to an in&s;ipid uniformity of method.</P>
<P>I DISCOVER in his di&s;cour&s;es no rhetorical movements, no great ideas, no &s;ublime &s;trokes: he generally divides every paragraph, and has thirty or forty &s;ubdivi&s;ions in each of his &s;er|mons. His particulars are in&s;ipid, futile, and often devoid of excellence. In &s;hort,
<PB N="180" REF="032455_0191_0FF26C1067491160">Tillot&s;on is &s;o much a &s;tranger to the art of Eloquence, that he &s;carcely ever makes an exordium or a peroration.

His warme&s;t admirers have never e&s;teemed him as a fir&s;t rate Orator, but have agreed with the general opinion in placing him in rather an inferior &s;ituation of that cla&s;s. He is, however, a great favor|ite among his countrymen, who attend &s;o much to the <HI>&s;apere</HI> from the pulpit, as to neglect the <HI>fari</HI> to a faulty degree. Let it be recol|lected, that he has been the mo&s;t powerful, the unan&s;werable op|ponent of the Romi&s;h church, and that Maury has indulged him|&s;elf in attacking the Prote&s;tant church, on the weake&s;t &s;ide of its mo&s;t formidable champion, whil&s;t he has affected to overlook many others le&s;s obnoxious, who&s;e claim to Oratory he dared not to con|travert. <BIBL>E. <HI>Albany.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>

<P>IN his &s;ermon on <Q>Prejudices again&s;t Re|ligion,</Q> Tillot&s;on &s;tarts an objection, drawn from the oppo&s;ition which man finds between his duty and his inclinations.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. iv. p. 35.</NOTE> This objec|tion he copies from the tragedy of Mu&s;tapha, by Fulke, lord Brooke, from which, he recites in the pulpit a &s;eries of ver&s;es.

<P>ELSEWHERE, in order to prove that the my&s;teries of religion ought to be believed, although we can never comprehend them with mathematical evidence, Tillot&s;on ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in this manner; <Q>we eat, we drink, every day, although, in my opinion, no one can demon&s;trate that his baker, his brewer, or his cook, have not put poi&s;on into the bread, the beer, or the meat.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 112; or, in the Engli&s;h edition, thus: <Q>Nay, which is more, men every day eat and drink, though I think no man can demon&s;trate out of Euclid or Apollonius, that his baker, or brewer, or cook, have not conveyed poi&s;on into his meat or drink.</Q> Vol. i.

<P>IN this manner did Tillot&s;on perform the mini&s;try of the word in the age of Dryden, Addi&s;on, Waller, Milton; and before that &s;ame Charles II. who had heard in his child|hood the mo&s;t illu&s;trious French Orators.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Abp.

The extravagant eulogiums of tho&s;e, who have extolled him as a pattern of excellence, and the fir&s;t Orator of England, have, perhaps, whetted the edge of our author's &s;evere cen&s;ures on his performances.
<P>Tillot&s;on, as a writer, had con&s;iderable merit; but he was not without his faults. His &s;tyle is &s;o deficient in accuracy and ele|gance, that it will not, in the pre&s;ent day of refinement, permit him to be held up as a model for imitation. At the &s;ame time, M.

<P>An acute and polite writer of our own country refu&s;es to Tillot|&s;on the character of an illu&s;trious Orator, and thinks that no man had ever le&s;s preten&s;ions to genuine Oratory than this celebrated preacher. "One cannot but regret," &s;ays he, <Q>that Dr. Tillot|&s;on, who abounds with &s;uch noble and generous &s;entiments &s;hould want the art of &s;etting them off with all the advantage they de|&s;erve; that the &s;ublime in morals &s;hould not be attended with a &s;uitable elevation of language. The truth, however, is, his words are frequently ill-cho&s;en, and almo&s;t always ill-placed; his periods are both tedious and unharmonious; as his metaphors are generally mean, and often ridiculous; a fault, which &s;eems to be chiefly owing to his having had no &s;ort of notion of rhetor|ical numbers. A noble &s;implicity at the &s;ame time runs through his di&s;cour&s;es.</Q></P> <BIBL>FITZOSBORNE'S <HI>Letters,</HI> Let. xiv.</BIBL>
<P>The learned Dr. DODDRIDGE, in his <Q>Character of Engli&s;h Divines,</Q> (in MS) makes the following conci&s;e remarks on Tillot&s;on: <Q>Some pertinent expre&s;&s;ions; method admirably clear, beyond almo&s;t any other man. Many &s;ermons contain nothing remarkable, particularly in his po&s;thumous works; yet &s;ome there are equal to any formerly publi&s;hed. His be&s;t pieces are tho&s;e at the beginning of his fir&s;t and &s;econd volumes; &s;uch are tho&s;e "on evil &s;peaking," and "forgiving our enemies." He made great u&s;e of Barrow and Wilkins, with whom compare &s;ome few of his &s;ermons. No man ever found &s;uch lucky argu|ments, nor repre&s;ented the adver&s;ary's &s;entiments more artfully for confutation.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. BLAIR'S &s;entiments of Tillot&s;on are thus expre&s;&s;ed: <Q>Til|lot&s;on has long been admired as an eloquent writer, and a model for preaching. But his eloquence, if we can call it &s;uch, has been often mi&s;under&s;tood. For, if we include in the idea of eloquence, vehemence and &s;trength, picture&s;que de&s;cription, glowing figures, or correct arrangement of &s;entences, in all the&s;e parts of Oratory the Archbi&s;hop is exceedingly deficient. His &s;tyle is always pure, indeed, and per&s;picuous, but carele&s;s and remi&s;s, too often feeble and languid; little beauty in the con|&s;truction of his &s;entences, which are frequently &s;uffered to drag unharmoniou&s;ly; &s;eldom any attempt towards &s;trength or &s;ub|limity. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e defects, &s;uch a con&s;tant vein of good &s;en&s;e and piety runs through his works, &s;uch an earne&s;t and &s;erious manner, and &s;o much u&s;eful in&s;truction conveyed in a &s;tyle &s;o pure, natural, and unaffected, as will ju&s;tly recom|mend him to high regard, as long as the Engli&s;h language re|mains; not, indeed, as a model of the highe&s;t eloquence, but as a &s;imple and amiable writer, who&s;e manner is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of great goodne&s;s and worth. As appears in the Archbi&s;hop, negligence may &s;ometimes be carried &s;o far, as to impair the beauty of &s;implicity, and make it border on a flat and languid manner.</Q></P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. i. p. 393, 394.</BIBL>

<P>THE preachers of Charles II. who hap|pened to hear Bourdaloue at Paris, have but faintly imitated him; and even now, when his &s;ermons are &s;pread through the whole of Europe, the revolution, which they ought to produce in Chri&s;tian Eloquence, hath not, as yet, taken place among&s;t the Engli&s;h.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Engli&s;h preachers" &s;ays a very &s;en&s;ible writer, <Q>are, it is certain, more di&s;tingui&s;hed by their ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment, and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, than by their oratorial powers, or talents of affecting the pa&s;&s;ions.

<P><Q>The French and Engli&s;h writers of Sermons proceed upon very different ideas of the Eloquence of the Pulpit; and &s;eem indeed to have &s;plit is betwixt them. A French &s;ermon is, for the mo&s;t part, a warm, animated exhortation; an Engli&s;h one, is a piece of cool, in&s;tructive rea&s;oning. The French preachers addre&s;s them&s;elves chiefly to the imagination and the pa&s;&s;ions; the En|gli&s;h, almo&s;t &s;olely to the under&s;tanding. It is the union of the&s;e two kinds of compo&s;ition, of the French earne&s;tne&s;s and warmth, with the Engli&s;h accuracy and rea&s;on, that would form, accord|ing to my idea, the model of a perfect &s;ermon.</Q></P>

<P>"In the pulpit," &s;ays Dr. BLAIR, <Q>the Briti&s;h divines have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the mo&s;t accurate and rational com|po&s;itions, which, perhaps, any nation can boa&s;t of. Many print|ed &s;ermons we have full of good &s;en&s;e, and of &s;ound divinity and morality; but the Eloquence to be found in them, the power of per&s;ua&s;ion, of intere&s;ting and engaging the heart, which is, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ought to be, the great object of the pulpit, is far from bearing a &s;uitable proportion to the excellence of the matter. There are few arts, in my opinion, farther from perfection, than that of preaching is among us. In proof of the fact it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that an Engli&s;h &s;ermon, in&s;tead of being a per&s;ua&s;ive, animated Oration, &s;eldom ri&s;es beyond the &s;train of correct and dry rea&s;oning: whereas, in the &s;ermons of Bo&s;&s;uet, Ma&s;&s;illon, Bourdaloue, and Flechier, among the French, we &s;ee a much higher &s;pecies of Eloquence aimed at, and in a great mea&s;ure attained, than the Briti&s;h preachers have in view. The French have adopted higher ideas both of plea&s;ing and per&s;uading by means of Oratory, though, &s;ometimes, in the execution, they fail. In Great-Britain, we have taken up Eloquence on a lower key; but in our execution have been more correct. In France, the &s;tyle of their Orators is ornamented with bolder figures; and their di&s;cour&s;e carried on with more amplification, more warmth and elevation. The compo&s;ition is often very beautiful; but &s;ometimes, al&s;o, too diffu&s;e, and deficient in that &s;trength and cogency which render Eloquence powerful.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Modern Eloquence is much more cool and temperate than the Grecian and Roman; and in G. Britain e&s;pecially, has confined it&s;elf almo&s;t wholly to the argumentative and rational. It is much of that &s;pecies which the ancient critics called the "Te|nuis," or "Subtilis;" which aims at convincing and in&s;tructing, rather than affecting the pa&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;umes a tone not much higher than common argument and di&s;cour&s;e.</Q></P>

<P>Still, however, though much remains to be accompli&s;hed in our i&s;land in the art of pulpit-elocution, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we are by no means deficient in theological di&s;cour&s;es, which would reflect honour on any country, or in compo&s;itions, which will bear to undergo the ordeal of a correct attic ta&s;te. And it appears to be a well-founded, as it is a plea&s;ing reflection, that our pulpit-com|po&s;itions have been, for &s;ome length of time, in an improving &s;tyle. The Divines of the la&s;t century wanted, it is true, that accuracy and refinement of ta&s;te, which characterize &s;ome of our modern di&s;cour&s;es; but &s;ome of them abounded in lofty &s;entiments and un|que&s;tionable energy. The works of JEREMIAH TAYLOR, HOP|KINS, HOWE, BATES, and others, have in them traits of genuine Eloquence. In times &s;omewhat later, we can boa&s;t of the &s;ermons of SEED, ATTERBURY, HOADLY, SHERLOCK, SECKER, BUTLER, DODDRIDGE, WATTS, and others: and in the pre&s;ent day the names of PORTEUS, DAVIS, GERRARD, OGILVI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, LEECHMA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, BLAIR, FORDYCE, HU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ER, and many others, might perhaps be adduced as no bad &s;pecimens of the height to which the Eloquence of the pulpit hath been advanced.

WHITFIELD and WES|LEY: to the former of the&s;e the de&s;cription and character given by M. Maury to Bridaine, (p. 63) bears, in various re&s;pects, a con|&s;iderable re&s;emblance.</P>

Neither Homer, nor any other poet, ever equalled I&s;aiah de&s;cribing the maje&s;ty of God, in who&s;e &s;ight the "nations of the earth are as the &s;mall du&s;t; yea le&s;s than nothing, and vanity;" &s;eeing it is He that &s;tretcheth out the heavens like a curtain, and &s;preadeth them out as a tent to dwell in." (Ch. xl. 10, &amp;c) Sometimes this pro|phet has all the &s;weetne&s;s of an eclogue, in the &s;miling images he gives us of peace: (See ch. xi. and xxxv.) and &s;ometimes he &s;oars &s;o high as to leave every thing below him. What is there in antiquity that can be compared to the Lamentations of Jere|miah, when he tenderly deplores the mi&s;eries of his country? (v. 2, &amp;c. ch. ii. and ch. iii.) or to the prophecy of Nahum, when he fore&s;ees in &s;pirit the proud Nineveh fall under the rage of an invincible army? (i. 3, &amp;c.) We fancy that we &s;ee the army, and hear the noi&s;e of arms and chariots. Every thing is painted in &s;uch a lively manner, as &s;trikes the imagination. The pro|phet far out-does Homer. Read likewi&s;e Daniel denouncing to Bel&s;hazzar the divine vengeance ready to overwhelm him; and try if you can find any thing in the mo&s;t &s;ublime originals of an|tiquity, that can be compared to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ.

<P>Dr. BLAIR recommends the language of Sacred Scripture to Preachers, by &s;aying, that <Q>when properly employed, it is a great ornament to &s;ermons. It may be employed, either in the way of quotation, or allu&s;ion. Direct quotations brought from &s;crip|ture, in order to &s;upport what the preacher inculcates, both give authority to his doctrine, and render his di&s;cour&s;e more &s;olemn and venerable. Allu&s;ions to remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, or expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture, when introduced with propriety, have generally a plea&s;ing effect. They afford the preacher a fund of metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion, which no other compo&s;ition enjoys, and by means of which he can vary and enliven his &s;tyle. But he mu&s;t take care that any &s;uch allu&s;ions be natural and ea&s;y; for if they &s;eem forced, they approach to the nature of conceits.</Q> Dr. Blair refers us for examples to Bi&s;hop Sherlock's Di&s;cour&s;es, vol. i. di&s;c. i. and to Seed's Sermons, &s;erm. iv.</P> <BIBL>BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 115, 116.</BIBL></NOTE></P>

A CHRISTIAN Orator may, and even ought to, &s;eize upon all the riches, which he di&s;covers in the&s;e divine books. It is there where plagiari&s;m is permitted him, and the more trea&s;ures he draws from thence, the better are his auditors plea&s;ed with his thefts.</P>

<P>I AM aware, that, in their writings, the pu|rity of &s;tyle doth not always corre&s;pond with the extent of erudition, e&s;pecially if we com|pare them with Cicero and Demo&s;thenes.

<P>IT is not, however, requi&s;ite that a Preach|er &s;hould read all tradition. For this, his life would &s;carcely &s;uffice.

<P>ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM is principally de|&s;erving of having the choice of a Chri&s;tian Orator fixed upon him.

<P>"This man, &s;o famous in the annals of the new world, had ac|companied his father, in the fir&s;t voyage made by Columbus. The mildne&s;s and &s;implicity of the Indians affected him &s;o &s;trongly, that he made him&s;elf an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, in order to devote his labours to their conver&s;ion. But this &s;oon became the lea&s;t of his attentions. As he was more a man than a prie&s;t, he felt more for the cruelties exerci&s;ed again&s;t them, than for their &s;uper&s;titions. He employed every method in order to comfort the people for whom he had con|ceived an attachment, or to &s;often their tyrants. He became the avowed patron of the Indians; and, by his bold interpo&s;itions on their behalf, as well as by the re&s;pect due to his abilities and cha|racter, he had often the merit of &s;etting &s;ome bounds to the ex|ce&s;&s;es of his countrymen. He did not fail to remon&s;trate warmly again&s;t the proceedings of Albuquerque, and, though he &s;oon found that attention to his own intere&s;t rendered that rapacious officer deaf to admonition, he did not abandon the wretched people, who&s;e cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed.

The noted RICHARD BAXTER, al&s;o, though too fond of contro|ver&s;y, and his &s;tyle, far from being correct or elegant, has, not|with&s;tanding, in &s;ome of his practical pieces, and particularly in that one intituled <HI>the Saints everla&s;ting Re&s;t,</HI> &s;ome fine and affecting pa&s;&s;ages. He only wanted <Q>his genius to be curbed by &s;alutary checks,</Q> to have obtained, in his practical works, the character of a pathetic writer. There is in HOWE'S "living temple," a grand and beautiful metaphorical de&s;cription of human depravity under the idea of a ruinous temple (p. 155;) and in Bi&s;hop SHER|LOCK'S di&s;cour&s;es, a fine and much admired piece of Eloquence, where the character of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord is contra&s;ted with that of the impo&s;tor Mahomet, (v. i. p. 271;) though, perhaps, neither of the&s;e can be properly cla&s;&s;ed as <HI>pathetic</HI> pieces.
<P>Where &s;hall we find any pa&s;&s;ages more excellent and pathetic in their kind, than in Dr. GROSVENOR'S &s;ermon, intituled <Q>the Temper of Je&s;us towards his Enemies?</Q></P>
<P>The ingenious Dr. Knox has the following &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervations on the pathetic &s;tyle, particularly as it is to be found in &s;cripture, and in the works of Sterne:</P>
<P><Q>There mu&s;t be a charm added by the creative power of genius, which no didactic rules can teach, which cannot be adequately de&s;cribed, but which is powerfully felt by the vibrations of the heart-&s;trings, and which cau&s;es an irre&s;i&s;tible overflowing of the <HI>&s;acri fontes lachrymarum.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Florid diction and pompous declamation are, indeed, found to be the lea&s;t adapted of all modes of addre&s;s to affect the finer &s;en&s;ibilities of nature. Plain words, without epithets, without metaphors, without &s;imilies, have oftener excited emotions of the tendere&s;t &s;ympathy, than the mo&s;t laboured compo&s;itions of Cor|neille. A few words of &s;imple pathos will penetrate the &s;oul to the quick, when a hundred lines of declamation &s;hall a&s;&s;ail it as feebly and ineffectually, as a gentle gale the mountain of Plin|limmon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A writer of ta&s;te and genius may avail him&s;elf greatly in pa|thetic compo&s;itions, by adopting the many words and phra&s;es, re|markable for their beautiful &s;implicity, which are inter&s;per&s;ed in that plea&s;ing, as well as venerable book, the Holy Bible&punc; Be&s;ides its a&s;toni&s;hing &s;implicity, it has many a pa&s;&s;age exqui&s;itely tender and pathetic.</Q></P>

Affliction had touched her looks with &s;omething that was &s;carce earthly, and &s;o much was there about her of all that the heart wi&s;hes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, or tho&s;e of Eliza out of mine, &s;he &s;hould not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at of my bread, and drink of my cup, but Maria &s;hould lie in my bo&s;om, and be unto me as a daughter." "A|dieu, poor, luckle&s;s maiden! imbibe the oil and wine, which the compa&s;&s;ion of a &s;tranger, as he &s;ojourneth on his way, now pours into thy wounds. The Being, who has twice brui&s;ed thee, can only bind them up for ever." Again, in his de&s;cription of the captive: "As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopele&s;s eye towards the door, then ca&s;t it down, &s;hook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little &s;tick upon the bundle. He gave a deep &s;igh. I &s;aw the iron enter into his &s;oul." It would be ea&s;y to adduce many other in&s;tances, in which a writer, who eminently excelled in the power of moving the affections, felt him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of advancing the &s;tyle of pathos to its highe&s;t perfection, and &s;ought a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bible.</Q></P> <BIBL>KNOX'S <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> No. 154.</BIBL>

<P>To the&s;e may not be improperly added a &s;pecimen of affecting Eloquence in an American Indian. "I may challenge," &s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on, <Q>the whole Orations of Demo&s;thenes and Cicero, and of any more eminent Orator, if Europe has furni&s;hed more eminent, to produce a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age &s;uperior to the &s;peech of Logan, a Mingo chief, to lord Dunmore, when governor of Vir|ginia. The following incidents that occurred in the &s;pring of the year 1774, were the occa&s;ion of it. A robbery and murder had been committed on the inhabitants of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians. The neighbouring whites, according to their cu&s;tom, undertook to puni&s;h this outrage in a &s;ummary way. A party was collected, and proceeded in que&s;t of vengeance. Un|fortunately, a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was &s;een coming from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, unarmed, and un&s;u&s;|pecting an ho&s;tile attack from the whites. The moment the canoe reached the &s;hore, the white party, who had been con|cealed, &s;ingled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every per&s;on in it. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had been long di&s;tingui&s;hed as a friend of the whites. This un|worthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly &s;ignal|ized him&s;elf in the war which en&s;ued A deci&s;ive battle was &s;oon afterwards &s;ought, in which the Indians were defeated and &s;ued for peace. Logan, however, di&s;dained to be &s;een among the &s;up|pliants. But, le&s;t the &s;incerity of a treaty &s;hould be di&s;tru&s;ted, from which &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a chief ab&s;ented him&s;elf, he &s;ent by a me&s;&s;enger the following &s;peech to be delivered to lord Dunmore:</Q></P>
<P><Q>I appeal to any white man to &s;ay if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>During the cour&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> long and bloody war, Logan re|mained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed, as they pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid, "Logan is the friend of white men."

<P>IT would be to no purpo&s;e to object to me here the example of Cicero, in his beau|tiful Oration again&s;t Verres. The Orator &s;ucce&s;&s;ively invokes, in his Peroration, all the gods and godde&s;&s;es, who&s;e temples this robber

<P>The learned Dr. WATTS, in his Thoughts, intitled <Q>Words without Spirit,</Q> de&s;cribes the following character: <Q>Lectorius is a pious man; and worthy mini&s;ter in a country pari&s;h; his di&s;cour&s;es are well formed, his &s;entiments on almo&s;t every &s;ub|ject are ju&s;t and proper, his &s;tyle is modern, and not unpolite, nor does he utterly neglect the pa&s;&s;ions in the turn of his com|po&s;ures; yet I cannot call him a good preacher, for he does not only u&s;e his written notes to &s;ecure his method, and to relieve his memory, but he &s;carce ever takes his eye from of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his book to addre&s;s him&s;elf with life and &s;pirit to the people: for this rea&s;on, many of his hearers fall a&s;leep: the re&s;t of them fit from January to December, regardle&s;s and unconcerned; an air of indolence reigns through the faces of his auditory, as if it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> matter of no importance, or not addre&s;&s;ed to them, and his min|i&s;trations have little power or &s;ucce&s;s. In his la&s;t &s;ermon, he had a u&s;e of reproof for &s;ome vices which were practi&s;ed in a public and &s;hamele&s;s manner in his pari&s;h, and he thought that the&s;e &s;ins ought not to e&s;cape a public rebuke. The paragraph was well drawn up, and indeed it was animated with &s;ome ju&s;t and awful &s;everities of language; yet he had not courage enough to chide the guilty, nor to animate his voice with any ju&s;t degree of zeal. However, the good man did his be&s;t, he went into the pulpit, and read them a chiding.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His conduct is ju&s;t the &s;ame when he de&s;igns his addre&s;s in his paper to any of the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions; for by the coldne&s;s of his pronunciation, and keeping his eye ever fixed on his notes, he makes very little impre&s;&s;ion on his hearers. When he &s;hould awaken &s;en&s;ele&s;s and ob&s;tinate &s;inners, and pluck them as brands out of the burning, he only reals to them out of his book &s;ome words of pity, or perhaps a u&s;e of terror; and if he would lament over their impenitence and approaching ruin, he can do no more than read them a chapter of lamentation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since there are &s;o many of the kindred of Lectorius in our nation, it is no wonder that &s;ome of them ari&s;e to vindicate the family and their practice. Do not the Engli&s;h &s;ermons, &s;ay they, excee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e of other nations, becau&s;e they are compo&s;ed with &s;o much ju&s;tne&s;s and accuracy, and by careful reading they are delivered with great exactne&s;s to the people, without tru&s;ting o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence to the frailty of the memory, or the warmth of &s;udden imagination? I am &s;ure it may be replied, that if the Engli&s;h &s;ermons exceed tho&s;e of our neighbours, the Engli&s;h preachers would exceed them&s;elves, if they would learn the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of reading by the glance of an eye, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s never to interrupt the force of their argument, nor the vivacity and patho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their pronunciation; or if they made them&s;elves &s;o much ma&s;ters of that they had written, and delivered it with &s;uch life and &s;pirit, &s;uch freedom and fervency, as though it came all fre&s;h from the head and the heart. It is by this art of pronouncing, as well as by a warm compo&s;ure, that &s;ome of the French praechers reign over their a&s;&s;emblies, like Cicero or Demo&s;thenes of old, and that, with &s;uperior dignity and power, as is &s;eldom &s;een now-a-days in an Engli&s;n audience, what&s;oever e&s;teem may be paid to our writings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A paper with the mo&s;t pathetic lines written upon it, has no fear or hope, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal or compa&s;&s;ion; it is con&s;cious of no de&s;ign, nor has any &s;olicitude for the &s;ucce&s;s; and a mere reader, who coldly tells the people what his paper &s;ays, &s;eems to be as void of all the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary qualifications, as his paper is.</Q></P>

<P>Dr. BLAIR &s;hall conclude the authorities quoted upon this point: <Q>With regard to the pulpit, it has certainly been a great di&s;|advantage, that the practice of reading &s;ermons has prevailed &s;o univer&s;ally in England. This may, indeed, have introduced ac|curacy; but it has done great prejudice to Eloquence; for a di&s;cour&s;e re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, is far inferior to an Oration &s;poken. It leads to a different &s;ort of compo&s;ition, as well as of delivery; and can never have an equal effect upon any audience. The odium of the different &s;ects, about the time of the Re&s;toration, drove the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church from that warmth which the &s;ectaries were judged to have carried too far, into the oppo&s;ite extreme of a &s;tudied coolne&s;s, and compo&s;ure of manner. Hence, from the art of per&s;ua&s;ion, which preaching ought always to be, it has pa&s;&s;ed, in England, into mere rea&s;oning and in&s;truction; which not only has brought down the Eloquence of the Pulpit to a lower tone than it might ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ume; but has produced this farther effect, that, by accu&s;toming the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar to &s;uch cool and di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;cour&s;es, it has tended to fa&s;hion other kinds of pub|lic &s;peaking upon the &s;ame model.</Q> BLAIR'S <HI>Lectures,</HI> vol. ii. p. 43, 44.</P>
<P>The &s;ame author &s;ays el&s;ewhere, <Q>that the practice of reading &s;ermons is one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles to the Eloquence of the Pulpit in Great-Britain, where alone this practice prevails. No di&s;cour&s;e, which is de&s;igned to be per&s;ua&s;ive, can have the &s;ame force when read, as when &s;poken. The common people all feel this, and their prejudice again&s;t this practice is not without foun|dation in nature: what is gained hereby in point of correctne&s;s, is not equal to what is lo&s;t in point of per&s;ua&s;ion and force?</Q></P>

They &s;hould diffu&s;e throughout every part of the di&s;cour&s;e the ardour with which they are animated. They &s;hould &s;peak authoritatively, in order to arre&s;t the attention of the hearers. They &s;hould avoid the declamation of an actor, and be cautious of introducing theatrical pantomime in the pulpit, which will never &s;ucceed. They &s;hould begin with pitching their voice at a proper medium, &s;o that the

<HEAD>SECTION LX. <HI>Of Motives to excite the Emulation of Chri&s;tian Orators.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM aware that the&s;e multiplied correc|tions occa&s;ion very painful labour to Chri&s;tian preachers. Neverthele&s;s, that which is really di&s;heartening and &s;eriou&s;ly alarming to us in our mini&s;try, is neither the &s;tudy, which compo&s;ition requires, nor the re&s;tric|tion, which memory impo&s;es on us; but the di&s;couragements increa&s;ing as we grow old in our profe&s;&s;ion&punc; the la&s;&s;itude, which per|petually attends the repetition of &s;ermons, no longer delivered but with reluctance; the certainty of di&s;covering faults continually in our di&s;cour&s;es, and of finding our&s;elves, thus, not only very much on this &s;ide perfection, but even below the level of our own abilities; and, above all, the indifference of our age for religion. Hence it is, that per&s;ons attend to religious in&s;truction, as they would to a pro|fane &s;pectacle; that they are de&s;irous of re|ducing our zeal to the &s;acrifice of the mo&s;t important truths, and the mo&s;t forcible Elo|quence, to I know not what frivolous &s;ubject, or rhetorical flowers; and that, in fine, it &s;eems as if it were expected of us to degrade
<PB N="237" REF="032455_0248_0FF26D1189946C50">our&s;elves, both as Apo&s;tles and Orators, in order to plea&s;e the multitude.</P>
<P>THESE draughts are, no doubt, bitter. It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;wallow them, &s;hould we only &s;ucceed in reclaiming one wicked man to virtue, of pre&s;erving one wretched man from de&s;pair; in a word, of preventing one &s;ingle crime from the earth.</P>
<P>AH! what more can be nece&s;&s;ary in order to quicken our ardour? Is there a virtuous and feeling mind, that can de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a de|lightful reward?</P>
<P>WE &s;hall have fulfilled the end of our vocation, when we render our&s;elves u&s;eful to men; in their felicity we &s;hall receive an in|demnification for all our &s;acrifices: the plea&s;|ing remembrance of our youthful labours will &s;erve to delight the &s;olitude, and to con&s;ole the inactivity, of our advanced years; and, when Death &s;ahll lay his heavy hand upon our eye-lids, we &s;hall each be able to &s;ay to that great GOD, who&s;e laws we have publi&s;h|ed <Q>O my Father! thou ha&s;t given me thy children to in&s;truct. I re&s;tore them to thee better. Remember all the ble&s;&s;ings, which thou ha&s;t poured upon thy people, through the in&s;trumentality of thy mini&s;tering &s;er|vant. Let the tears, which I have dried up, the tears, which I have excited when
<PB N="238" REF="032455_0249_0FF26C7F495C7FE8">pleading in thy name, plead with thee on my behalf. I have been the in&s;trument of thy clemency: make me hereafter the ob|ject of thy tender mercies.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY other inducement, doubtle&s;s, dwin|dles to a point before the&s;e great objects.</P>
<P>IF it were allowable, when entering upon this cour&s;e of life, to hold human encourage|ments in any degree of e&s;timation, I &s;hould &s;ay, without dread of contradiction, that, with a view of reviving the reli&s;h for Evan|gelical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oquence, the &s;ame means are made u&s;e of among us, which excited &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful an emulation in the excellent days of the age of Louis XIV.</P>
<P>NEVER, in the record of eccle&s;ia&s;tical pre|ferments, have Chri&s;tian Orators found a more di&s;tingui&s;hed attention paid to their labours, nor a more marked good will to reward their talents.</P>
<P>AFTER having, in this manner, unfolded the ideas, which have ari&s;en in my own mind, on the &s;ubject of Eloquence, I am not afraid of being charged with having &s;acri&s;iced the rules of ta&s;te to the purpo&s;es of my own vanity.</P>
<P>THE theories of individuals are, for the mo&s;t part, only indirect apologies for the compo&s;itions of their authors; and, de&s;pair
<PB N="239" REF="032455_0250_0FF26D14468D71C8">of equalling the ancient models, often gives ri&s;e to extravagant &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>BUT if my rhetorical writings be inferior to my theory, I can, at lea&s;t, willingly bear this te&s;timony, from the bottom of my heart, that, in deriving the Principles of Eloquence from nature, or from the chief performances of our greate&s;t ma&s;ters, I have been actuated by no other motive than a warm attachment to truth, and the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitude to contribute to the advancement of &s;cience.</P>
