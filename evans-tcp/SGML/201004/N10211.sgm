<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not with any de&s;ign or de&s;ire unnece&s;&s;a|rily to expo&s;e the late oppre&s;&s;ors of that good prote&s;tant people which is in <HI>New-England,</HI> that the authors of the en&s;uing <HI>vindication</HI> have pub|li&s;hed what is herewith emitted. But the <HI>agents</HI> lately &s;ent from thence could not be faithful to their tru&s;t, if when the people whom they repre|&s;ent are publicly (as well as privately) <HI>a&s;per&s;ed,</HI> they &s;hould not (either by them&s;elves, or by furni&s;h|ing &s;ome other with materials for &s;uch an under|taking) <HI>vindicate</HI> tho&s;e who have been &s;o deeply injured.</P>
<P>As for Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> his account, which he calls <HI>impartial,</HI> he has wronged <HI>New-England</HI> thereby, in &s;ome other particulars be&s;ides tho&s;e in&s;i&s;ted on, in the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>apology.</HI> For he does en|deavour
<PB N="4" REF="012973_0003_0F903FD788328A90">
to make the world believe that the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> refu&s;ed to an&s;wer to the <HI>quo-war|ranto</HI> pro&s;ecuted again&s;t their <HI>charter:</HI> Than which mi&s;repre&s;entation nothing can be more untrue or injurious. An account concerning that matter hath formerly (and more than once) been made public, in the which it is mo&s;t truly affirmed, <Q>That when the <HI>quo-warranto</HI> was i&s;|&s;ued out again&s;t the governor and company of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony in <HI>New-England</HI> in the year 1683, the then king did by his decla|ration enjoin a few particular per&s;ons to make their defence at their own charge, without any public &s;tock; which &s;hewed that there was a re&s;olution to take away that charter: yet the governor and company appointed an attorney to an&s;wer to the <HI>quo warranto;</HI> but the &s;uit was let fall in the court of <HI>king's-bench,</HI> and a new &s;uit began by <HI>&s;cire facias</HI> in court of <HI>chan|cery,</HI> where time was not allowed to make defence. The former attorney for that colony brought &s;everal merchants to te&s;tify that in the time allowed (which was from <HI>April</HI> 16, till <HI>June</HI> 18) in was impo&s;&s;ible to have a new let|ter of attorney returned from <HI>New-England.</HI> The then lord keeper <HI>North</HI> replied, that no time ought to be given. So was judgment entered again&s;t them before they could po&s;&s;ibly plead for them&s;elves.</Q> By this the impartial reader may judge what ingenuity and veracity is in Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI> account.</P>
<P>There is lately come forth another <HI>&s;candalous pamphlet,</HI> called <HI>New-England's faction di&s;covered.</HI> The author has not put his name to it: But it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by a certain per&s;on

known to be a prodigy for impudence and lying. The reflection in it not only on <HI>New-England</HI> in general, but on particular per&s;ons there as well as in <HI>England,</HI> are &s;o notoriou&s;ly and mali|ciou&s;ly fal&s;e, as that it mu&s;t needs be much be|neath a great mind to take notice of &s;uch <HI>latra|tions,</HI> or to an&s;wer them any otherwi&s;e than with contempt. When we are treated with the buf|foonry and railery of &s;uch ungenteel pens, it is good to remember the old &s;aying, <HI>mognum con|tumeliae remedium, negligentia.</HI></P>
<P>As for what Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> does in his preface in&s;inuate concerning the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> being <HI>common-wealths-men, enemies to monarchy, and to the church of England,</HI> that is &s;uch a <HI>&s;ham</HI> as every one &s;ees through it.</P>
<P>There are none in the world that do more ful|ly concur with the <HI>doctrine</HI> of the church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> contained in the 39 articles, than do <HI>the churches in New-England,</HI> as is manife&s;t from the confe&s;&s;ion of their faith publi&s;hed in the year 1680. Only as to <HI>liturgy and ceremonies</HI> they differ; for which cau&s;e alone it was that they, or their fathers, tran&s;ported them&s;elves into that <HI>American de&s;ert,</HI> as being de&s;irous to wor&s;hip God in that way which they thought was mo&s;t accor|ding to the &s;criptures. The <HI>platform of church di&s;cipline</HI> con&s;ented unto by the elders and me&s;|&s;engers of the churches a&s;&s;embled in a general &s;ynod at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> in the year 1647, &s;heweth that they are as to <HI>church govern|ment</HI> for the <HI>congregational way.</HI> The judiciou&s;|ly learned Mr. <HI>Philip Nye</HI> has long &s;ince evinced that no form of church-government (no not that which is epi&s;copal) is more con&s;i&s;tent with mo|narchy,

or with the king's &s;upremacy, than that of the <HI>way-congregational,</HI> which &s;ome will needs call <HI>independent.</HI> But there are a &s;ort of men, who call tho&s;e that are for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liberties, and that rejoice in the government of their pre&s;ent maje&s;ties, king <HI>William</HI> and queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by the name of <HI>republicans,</HI> and repre&s;ent all &s;uch as enemies of monarchy and of the church. It is not our &s;ingle opinion only, but we can &s;peak it on the behalf of the generality of their maje&s;|ties &s;ubjects in <HI>New-England,</HI> that they believe (without any diminution to the glory of our for|mer princes) the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation was never &s;o hap|py in a <HI>king,</HI> or in a <HI>queen,</HI> as at this day. And the God of heaven, who has &s;et them on the throne of the&s;e kingdoms, grant them long and pro&s;perou&s;ly to reign.</P>

<HEAD>THE REVOLUTION IN NEW-ENGLAND JUSTIFIED.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> which a &s;ort of men did of late, when they thought the world would never change, cry up as divine truth, is by means of the happy <HI>revolution</HI> in the&s;e nations, exploded, and the a&s;&s;ertors of it become ridiculous.</P>
<P>No man does really approve of the <HI>revolution</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but mu&s;t ju&s;tify that in <HI>New-England</HI> al&s;o; for the latter was effected in compliance with the former, neither was there any de&s;ign among the <HI>people in New-England</HI> to rea&s;&s;ume their an|cient <HI>charter-government,</HI> until his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's intend|ed de&s;cent into <HI>England,</HI> to re&s;cue the nation from <HI>&s;lavery</HI> as well as <HI>popery,</HI> was known to them (for indeed to have at|tempted it before that would have been madne&s;s.) They

con&s;idered that the men then u&s;urping government in <HI>New-England</HI> were king <HI>James</HI>'s creatures, who had invaded both the <HI>liberty and property of Engli&s;h prote&s;tants</HI> after &s;uch a manner as perhaps the like was never known in any part of the world where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation has any government; and the <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI> which they had obtained from the late king <HI>James</HI> was more illegal and arbitrary, than that granted to <HI>Dudley</HI> and <HI>Emp&s;on</HI> by king <HI>Henry</HI> 7th. Or than it may be was ever be|fore given to any by king <HI>James</HI> him&s;elf, or by any one that ever &s;wayed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;cepter, which was a grievance into|lerable; and yet they de&s;ired not to make them&s;elves judges in a ca&s;e which &s;o nearly concerned them, but in&s;tead of har&s;her treatment of tho&s;e who had tyrannized over them, they only &s;ecured them that they might not betray that country into the hands of <HI>the late king,</HI> or of king <HI>Lewis,</HI> which they had rea&s;on enough to believe (con&s;idering their characters and di&s;po&s;itions) they were inclined to do. They de&s;igned not to revenge them&s;elves on their enemies, which they could as ea&s;ily have done as a thou&s;and men are able to kill one, and therefore when they &s;ecured their per&s;ons, they declared (as in their <HI>declaration</HI> printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> is to be &s;een) that they would <HI>leave it to the king and parliament of</HI> England, <HI>to inflict what puni&s;hment they &s;hould think meet for &s;uch criminals.</HI> Their &s;eizing and &s;ecuring the governor, was no more than was done in <HI>England,</HI> at <HI>Hull, Dover, Plymouth, &amp;c.</HI> that &s;uch a man as Mr. <HI>John Palmer</HI> &s;hould exclaim again&s;t it, is not to be wondered at, &s;eeing he was one of the governor's tools, being of his council, made a judge by him, and too much concerned in &s;ome illegal and arbitrary proceedings; but his confidence is wonderful, that he &s;hould publi&s;h in print that neither him&s;elf nor &s;ir <HI>Ed|mund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> nor others of them who had been &s;ecured by the people in <HI>New-England, had any crimes laid to their charge,</HI> whereas the fore&s;aid declaration emitted the very day they were &s;ecured, doth plainly &s;et forth their crimes.

<P N="1">1. IT is objected again&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> that he be|ing governor of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> colony, after notice of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's intention to land in <HI>England,</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a proclamation, requiring all per&s;ons to oppo&s;e any de&s;cent of &s;uch as might be authorized by him, endeavour|ed to &s;tifle the news of his landing, and cau&s;ed him that brought this king's declaration thither to be impri&s;oned, as bringing a &s;editious and trea&s;onable paper.</P>
<P N="2">2. That in the time of his government, he without form or colour of legal authority made laws de&s;tructive of the liberty of the people, impo&s;ed and levied taxes, threatened and impri&s;oned them that would not be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the illegal levies, denied that they had any property in their lands without patents from him, and during the time of actual war with the <HI>Indians,</HI> he did &s;upply them with amu|nition, and &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> declared, that they were incou|raged by him to make war upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he di&s;|countenanced making defence again&s;t the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. As to all the other per&s;ons impri&s;oned, they were accomplices and confederates with Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> and particularly Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Randolph,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> were of his council, and joined with him in his arbitrary laws and impo&s;itions, and in threatening and in puni&s;hing them who would not comply. Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> was his &s;ecretary, and guilty of great extortion, and gave out words which &s;hewed him&s;elf no friend to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> was his attorney at one time, and Mr. <HI>Farewell</HI> at another, both concerned in illegal proceedings de&s;tructive of the property of the &s;ubject. Mr. <HI>Farewell</HI> pro&s;ecuted them who refu&s;ed to comply with the illegal levies, and Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> brought &s;everal writs of intru&s;ion again&s;t men for their own land, and Mr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> another per&s;on impri&s;on|ed, though not named in the order, acted there for &s;ome years as an high &s;heriff, though he was a &s;tranger in the country, and had no e&s;tate there, during his &s;herievalty he impannelled juries of &s;trangers, who had no freehold in that country, and extorted unrea&s;onable fees.</P>

<P N="1">1. That Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> with others whom the people in <HI>New-England</HI> &s;eized, and &s;ecured did, <HI>after notice of his pre|&s;ent maje&s;ty's intended de&s;cent into</HI> England <HI>to deliver the na|tion from popery and arbitrary power, to their utmo&s;t oppo&s;e that glorious de&s;ign,</HI> is manife&s;t by the <HI>proclamation</HI> printed and publi&s;hed in <HI>New-England, Jan.</HI> 10, 1688, &s;igned by Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his deputy &s;ecretary <HI>John We&s;t,</HI> in which King <HI>James</HI>'s proclamation of <HI>October</HI> 16, 1688, is recited and referred unto. Sir <HI>Edmund's</HI> proclamation begins thus; <Q>Whereas his maje&s;ty has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed by his royal letter bearing date the 16th of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, to &s;ignify that he hath undoubted advice that a great and &s;udden <HI>inva&s;ion from Holland,</HI> with an armed force of fo|reigners and &s;trangers will be &s;peedily made in an ho&s;tile manner upon his maje&s;ty's kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and that although &s;ome fal&s;e <HI>pretences relating to liberty, property, and religion,' &amp;c.</HI> And then he concludes thus&mdash; 'All which it is his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be made known in the mo&s;t public manner to his loving &s;ubjects within this his territory and dominion of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they may be the better prepared to <HI>re&s;i&s;t any attempts</HI> that may be made by his maje&s;ty's enemies <HI>in the&s;e parts,</HI> I do therefore hereby charge and <HI>command all officers civil and military, and all other his maje&s;ty's loving &s;ubjects within this his territory</HI> and dominion afore&s;aid, to be vigilant and careful in their re&s;pective places and &s;tations, and <HI>that upon the approach of any fleet or foreign force, they be in readine&s;s, and u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to hinder any landing or inva&s;ion</HI> that may be intended to be made within the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. And that they u&s;ed all imaginable endeavours <HI>to &s;tifle the news of the prince's landing in England,</HI> appears not only from the te&s;timony of the people there, and from the letters of tho&s;e now in government at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> but from the depo&s;ition

<P>By the&s;e things it appears that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the people in <HI>New-England</HI> to &s;eize Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his accomplices, that &s;o they might &s;ecure that territory for their pre&s;ent maje&s;ties king <HI>William</HI> and queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. did <HI>make laws de&s;tructive to the liberty of the &s;ubjects,</HI> is notoriou&s;ly known, for they made what laws they plea&s;ed <HI>without any con&s;ent of the people, either by them&s;elves or repre&s;entatives,</HI> which is indeed to <HI>de&s;troy the fundamentals of the Engli&s;h</HI> and to <HI>erect a French government.</HI> We cannot learn that the like was ever practi&s;ed in any place where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are planters, but only where Sir <HI>Edmund An|dro&s;&s;e</HI> hath been governor: For whereas in <HI>New-England</HI> by con|&s;tant u&s;age under their charter government, the inhabitants of each town did a&s;&s;emble as occa&s;ion offered to con&s;ider of what might conduce to the welfare of their re&s;pective towns, the relief of the poor, or the like, Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e, with a few of his council,</HI> made a law prohibiting any town-meeting except once a year, <HI>viz.</HI> on the third Monday in <HI>May.</HI> The inhabitants of the country were &s;tartled at this law, as being apprehen&s;ive the de&s;ign of it was to prevent the people in every town from meeting to make complaints of their grie|vances. And whereas by con&s;tant u&s;age any per&s;on might remove out of the country at his plea&s;ure, a law was made that no man &s;hould do &s;o without the governor's leave. And all fi&s;hing boats, coa&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were to enter into a thou&s;and pounds bond, whereby fees were rai&s;ed for him&s;elf and crea|tures. This law could not pa&s;s at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> becau&s;e many of Sir <HI>Edmund</HI>'s council there oppo&s;ed it; but then a <HI>juncto</HI> of them meeting at <HI>New-York,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it; and after that law was made, how &s;hould any di&s;&s;atisfied per&s;ons ever obtain
<PB N="13" REF="012973_0012_0F903FDFC4A3E978">
liberty to go for <HI>England</HI> to complain of their being oppre&s;|&s;ed by <HI>arbitrary governors?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But be&s;ides all this, they made laws for the <HI>levying monies without the con&s;ent of the people either by them&s;elves or by an a&s;&s;embly;</HI> for in order to the &s;upporting their own go|vernment, they did by an act bearing date <HI>March</HI> 3, 1686, rai&s;e con&s;iderable &s;ums of money on the king's &s;ubjects in that part of his dominions, <HI>viz.</HI> a penny in the pound on all e&s;tates per&s;onal or real, twenty pence <HI>per</HI> head as poll mo|ney, a penny in the pound for goods imported, be&s;ides an ex|ci&s;e on wine, rum and other liquors.</P>
<P>It hath indeed been pleaded that all this was but what the laws of the country before the change of the government did allow. But this is vainly pretended, for there was no &s;uch law in force at the time when the&s;e &s;ums were levied, the former laws which did authorize it, were repealed <HI>October</HI> 10, 1683, &s;ome years before Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his accomplices had invaded the rights and liberties of the people there. More|over, in tho&s;e parts of the country where there were never any &s;uch laws in force, particularly in <HI>Plymouth</HI> colony, this money was levied, which they heavily complained of. Yet further, in another act dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 15, 1687, they did without any colour of ancient law make an additional du|ty of impo&s;t and exci&s;e, which rai&s;ed the duty, &s;ome ten &s;hillings, &s;ome twenty &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> pipe on wines, and &s;o on other things. Nay they levied monies on <HI>Connecticut</HI> colo|ny contrary to their charter, which was never vacated, than which nothing more illegal and arbitrary could have been perpetrated by them.</P>
<P N="5">5. They did not only act according to the&s;e illegal taxes, but they did <HI>inflict &s;evere puni&s;hment on tho&s;e true Engli&s;h men who did oppo&s;e their arbitrary proceedings,</HI> as &s;hall be made to appear in many in&s;tances. When the inhabitants of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> were required to choo&s;e a com|mi&s;&s;ioner to tax that town, &s;ome principal per&s;ons there that could not comply with what was demanded of them, did mode&s;tly give their rea&s;ons, for which they were committed to goal, as guilty of high mi&s;demeanours, and denied an <HI>ha|beus corpus,</HI> and were obliged to an&s;wer it at a court of <HI>oyer</HI> and <HI>terminer</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> And that they might be &s;ure to be found guilty, <HI>jurors</HI> were picked of &s;uch as were no freehol|ders, nay of &s;trangers; the pri&s;oners pleading <HI>the privilege of Engli&s;hmen</HI> not to be taxed without their own con&s;ent, they were told that <HI>the laws of</HI> England <HI>would not follow them to the end of the earth,</HI> they meant the privileges of the Engli&s;h law, for the penalties they re&s;olved &s;hould follow

them <HI>quo jure qu&acirc;que injuri&acirc;.</HI> And why &s;hould they in&s;i&s;t on, and talk of the privileges of Engli&s;hmen, when it had been declared in the governor's council, <HI>that the king's &s;ubjects in</HI> New-England <HI>did not differ much from &s;laves, and that the only difference was, that they were not bought and &s;old?</HI> But to go on with the matter before us; in as much as the pri&s;oners mentioned had a&s;&s;erted their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> liberties, they were &s;everely handled, not only impri&s;oned for &s;everal weeks, but fined and bound to their good behaviour; Mr. <HI>John Wi&s;e</HI> was fined fifty pounds be&s;ides co&s;ts of court, deprived of the means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and gave a thou&s;and pounds bond for good behavior. And Mr. <HI>John Appleton</HI> was fined fifty pounds and to give a thou&s;and pounds bond for good behavior, and moreover declared incapable to bear office, be&s;ides unrea&s;onable fees. After the &s;ame manner did they proceed with &s;everal others belonging to <HI>Ip&s;wich.</HI> Like|wi&s;e the towns men of <HI>Rowley, Sali&s;bury, Andover,</HI> &amp;c. had the &s;ame mea&s;ure.

As to the matter of fact, the per&s;ons concerned in <HI>the&s;e ille|gal and arbitrary judgments</HI> will not have the face to deny them; if they do, there are <HI>affidavits</HI> now in <HI>London</HI> which will evince what hath been related when ever there &s;hall be occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>It is a vanity in Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> to think that he hath an&s;we|red this by affirming, but not proving, that the <HI>Ip&s;wich men</HI> a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves in a <HI>riotous manner;</HI> for that &s;aying of his is very fal&s;e.

<P>The ground of our trouble, our crime was the copy tran&s;mitted to the council, <HI>viz.</HI> At a legal town meeting <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 23.

<P>Being called by tho&s;e in pre&s;ent authority to give my te&s;timony to the di&s;cour&s;e between Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and my&s;elf, when he came from the Indian war, as he pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Salem</HI> going for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>March</HI> 1688-9, I can|not refu&s;e it, and therefore declare as followeth, what was the &s;ub&s;tance of that di&s;cour&s;e. Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> then governor being acompanied with the attorney-general <HI>Gra|ham,</HI> &s;ecretary <HI>We&s;t,</HI> judge <HI>Palmer,</HI> the room being al&s;o full of other people, mo&s;t of them his attendants, he was plea|&s;ed to tell me, he would have my judgment about this que&s;tion; <HI>Whether all the lands in</HI> New-England <HI>were not the king's?</HI> I told him I was &s;urprized with &s;uch a que&s;|tion, and was not willing to &s;peak to it; that being a mi|ni&s;ter, if it was a que&s;tion about a matter of religion, I &s;hould not be aver&s;e, but this being a &s;tate matter, I did not look upon it as proper for me to declare my mind in it, therefore entreated again and again that I might be ex|cu&s;ed. Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> replied and urged me with much importunity, &s;aying, Becau&s;e you are a mini&s;ter, therefore we de&s;ire to know your judgment in it, then I told him, if I mu&s;t &s;peak to it, I would only &s;peak as a mini&s;ter from &s;cripture and rea&s;on, not medling with the law. He &s;aid, the king's attorney was pre&s;ent there to inform what was law. I then &s;aid, I did not under&s;tand that the lands of <HI>New-England</HI> were the king's, but the king's &s;ubjects, who had for more than &s;ixty years had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of them by a twofold right warranted by the word of God. 1. By a right of ju&s;t occupation from the grand charter in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> 1&s;t and 9th chapters, whereby God gave the earth to the &s;ons of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> to be &s;ubdued and repleni&s;hed. 2. By a right of purcha&s;e from the Indians, who were na|tive inhabitants, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land before the Engli&s;h came hither, and that having lived here &s;ixty years. I did certainly know that from the beginning of the&s;e plantations our fathers entered upon the land, partly
<PB N="19" REF="012973_0018_0F903FE507038458">
as a wilderne&s;s and <HI>Vacuum Domicilium,</HI> and partly by the con&s;ent of the Indians, and therefore care was taken to treat with them, and to gain their con&s;ent, giving them &s;uch a valuable con&s;ideration as was to their &s;atisfaction, and this I told them I had the more certain knowledge of, becau&s;e having learned the Indian language in my younger time, I was at &s;everal times made u&s;e of by the government, and by divers particular plantations as an interpreter in treating with the Indians about their lands, which being done and agreed on, the &s;everal town|&s;hips and proportions of lands of particular men were order|ed and &s;ettled by the government of the country, and therefore I did believe that the lands of <HI>New-England</HI> were the &s;ubjects properties, and not the king's lands. Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and the re&s;t replied, that the lands were the king's, and that he gave the lands within &s;uch limits to his &s;ubjects by a charter upon &s;uch conditions as were not performed, and therefore all the lands of <HI>New-England</HI> have returned to the king, and that the attorney general then pre&s;ent could tell what was law, who &s;pake divers things to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e as Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> had done, &s;lighting what I had &s;aid, and vilifying the Indian title, &s;aying, they were brutes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and u&s;ed the land, they &s;aid we were the king's &s;ubjects, and what lands the king's &s;ubjects have, they are the king's, and one of them u&s;ed &s;uch an expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>where-ever an Engli&s;hman &s;ets his foot, all that he hath is the king's,</HI> and more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. I told them that &s;o far as I under&s;tood, we received only the right and power of government from the king's charter within &s;uch limits and bounds, but the right of the land and &s;oil we had received from God according to his grand charter to the &s;ons of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Noah,</HI> and with the con&s;ent of the native inhabitants as I had expre&s;&s;ed before. They &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the king's right to the land as before, whereup|on I told them, I had heard it was a &s;tanding principle in law and rea&s;on, <HI>nil dat qui non habet;</HI> and from thence I propounded this argument, he that hath no right, can give no right to another, but the king had no right to the lands of <HI>America</HI> before the Engli&s;h came hither, therefore he could give no right to them. I told them, I knew not of any that could be pleaded but from a Popi&s;h principle, that chri&s;tians have a right to the lands of heathen, upon which the Pope as the head of the chri&s;tians had given the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to the king of <HI>Spain,</HI> but this was di&s;owned by all prote&s;tants. Therefore I left it to them to affirm and prove
<PB N="20" REF="012973_0019_0F903FE5C5AEB640">
the king's title. They replied and in&s;i&s;ted much upon that, that the king had a right by his &s;ubjects coming and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this land. And at la&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> &s;aid with indignation, either you are &s;ubjects or you are rebels, in|timating, as I under&s;tood him, according to the whole &s;cope and tendency of his &s;peeches and actions, that if we would not yield all the lands of <HI>New-England</HI> to be the king's, &s;o as to take patents for lands, and to pay rent for the &s;ame, then we &s;hould not be accounted &s;ubjects but rebels, and treated ac|cordingly. There were many other various replies and an&s;wers on both &s;ides, but this is the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of that di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>That Sir <HI>Edmund's high &s;heriff was a &s;tranger in the country, and one that had no e&s;tate there</HI> needs no proof, and that <HI>&s;trangers who had no freehold, were impannelled for Jurors</HI> is notoriou&s;ly known. So it was in the ca&s;e of the <HI>Ip&s;wich|men</HI> as hath been noted, and when that reverend per&s;on Mr. <HI>Charles Morton,</HI> was cau&s;ele&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted, he was not only compelled to an&s;wer (contrary to law) in another county, and not in that wherein the good &s;ermon they found fault with, was preached, but that if po&s;&s;ible, they might give him a blow, there was &s;ummoned to &s;erve as a jury man, one <HI>John Gib&s;on</HI> no hou&s;holder nor of any e&s;tate or credit, and one <HI>John Leving&s;worth</HI> a brick-layer, who lived in another colony two hundred miles di&s;tance. When tho&s;e in government will u&s;e &s;uch <HI>ba&s;e artifices</HI> as the&s;e to accompli&s;h their pernicious de&s;igns, how &s;hould any man's e&s;tate or life be &s;ecure under him?</P>
<P N="11">11. That the per&s;ons objected again&s;t, were &s;ome of them <HI>guilty of great extortion</HI> is manife&s;t from what has been rela|ted, and may yet be further proved, for (as by &s;ome in&s;tances we have already &s;een, and &s;hall now hear more) they <HI>com|pelled men to take patents for their own lands,</HI> which they and their fathers before them, had quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed till the&s;e co|vetous creatures became a <HI>nu&s;ance</HI> to the country, and it may be, none more criminal, as to this particular, than Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> and Mr. <HI>We&s;t.</HI> A friend of their own, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Randolph,</HI> does in &s;everal of his Letters bitterly complain of them upon this account. In a letter of his of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 25th, 1687, he writeth thus:</P>
<P><Q>I believe all the inhabitants in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> will be forced to take grants and conformations of their lands, as now intend|ed, the inhabitants of the province of <HI>Maine</HI> which will bring in <HI>va&s;t profits to Mr. We&s;t,</HI> he taking what fees he plea&s;es to demand.

the &s;ame, <HI>June,</HI> 21, 1688, he hath the&s;e words. <Q>I went to one <HI>Shurte</HI> town-clerk of <HI>Pemyquid,</HI> to know what lea&s;es were made lately, and by whom, and for what quit rent, he told me that above a year ago Captain <HI>Palmer,</HI> and Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> produced to them a commi&s;&s;ion from Colonel <HI>Dungan,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e of all their lands to whoever would take lea&s;es at five &s;hillings the hundred acres quit rent. They let there and at a place called <HI>Dartmouth</HI> twelve or &s;ixteen miles di&s;tant from <HI>Pemyquid</HI> about one hundred and forty lea&s;es, &s;ome had eight hundred or ten hundred acres, few le&s;s than a hundred, &s;ome but three or four acres and all paid 2<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> for pa&s;&s;ing their grants of 100 acres of wood|land, with twenty acres of mar&s;h where-ever it could be found, but this bred a great mi&s;chief among the people; few or none have their lands mea&s;ured or marked, they were in ha&s;te, and got what they could, <HI>they had their emi&s;|&s;aries among the poor people, and frighted them to take grants,</HI> &s;ome come and complained to the governor, and prayed him to <HI>confirm their rights which he refu&s;ed to do,</HI> the com|mi&s;&s;ion and whole proceeding being illegal, having notice they were to be under his government, they re&s;ented it, but &s;erved their turn. <HI>The poor have been very much oppre&s;&s;ed here,</HI> the fort run all to ruin, and wants a great deal to repair it. Captain <HI>Palmer</HI> and Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> laid out for them&s;elves &s;uch large lots, and Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> though not there, had a child's portion, I think &s;ome have eight thou&s;and or ten thou&s;and acres. <HI>I hear not of one penny rent comming in to the king, from them who have their grants confirmed at York.</HI> and the five &s;hillings an hundred acres was only <HI>a &s;ham</HI> upon the people: at our return we &s;aw very good land at <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> enough to make large &s;ettlements for many people. The governor will have it fir&s;t mea&s;ured, and then &s;urveyed, and then will di&s;po&s;e of it for &s;ettlements, Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> and his family are &s;ettled at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> he is made <HI>Attorney general, and now the governer is &s;afe in his</HI> New-York <HI>Confidents,</HI> all others being &s;trangers, to his <HI>council.</HI> 'Twas not well done of <HI>Palmer</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> to tear all in peices that was &s;ettled and granted at <HI>Pemyquid</HI> by Sir <HI>Edmund,</HI> that was the &s;eene where they <HI>placed and di&s;|placed at plea&s;ure and were as arbitary as the great Turk. Some of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of that ea&s;tern country were denied grants of their own lands, whil&s;t tho&s;e men have given the improved lands among&s;t them&s;elves,</HI> of which I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> hath complained.</Q> In another, <HI>May</HI> the 10th 1689, he &s;ays; <Q>I mu&s;t confe&s;s there have been <HI>ill men from
<PB N="38" REF="012973_0037_0F903FF7CAA24658">
New-York,</HI> who have too much &s;tudied the di&s;ea&s;e of this people, and both in courts and councils, they have not been <HI>treated well.</HI></Q> Thus does <HI>Edward Randolph,</HI> a bird of the &s;ame feather with them&s;elves confe&s;s the truth, as to this matter, concerning <HI>his brother</HI> Palmer <HI>and</HI> We&s;t.</P>
<P>And that <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive fees have been extorted by indigent and exacting officers</HI> is declared by Mr. <HI>Hinckley</HI> the pre&s;ent gover|nor of <HI>New-Plymouth</HI> in his <HI>narrative of the grievances and oppre&s;&s;ions of their maje&s;ties good &s;ubjects in the colony of</HI> New-Plymouth <HI>in</HI> New-England, <HI>by the illegal and arbitrary act|ings in the late Government under Sir</HI> Edmund Andro&s;&s;e, which <HI>narrative</HI> is too large to be here in&s;erted, but it is po&s;&s;ible it may be publi&s;hed by it&s;elf, whereby it will ap|pear that every corner in the country did ring with com|plaints of the oppre&s;&s;ions, and (to &s;peak in Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI>'s phra&s;e) <HI>horrible u&s;ages</HI> of the&s;e ill men. Some pa&s;&s;ages out of Mr. <HI>Hinckley's narrative</HI> re&s;pecting this matter, we &s;hall here tran&s;cribe, who&s;e words are the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P><Q>The bill of co&s;t taxed by judge <HI>Palmer</HI> &s;eems al&s;o to be the greate&s;t extortion ever heard of before, as thrice twen|ty &s;hillings for three motions for judgment at the &s;ame term, (and was it not their courte&s;y they did not move ten times one after another at the &s;ame rate) and taxed al&s;o, <HI>five pound for the king's attorney, and one and twenty &s;hillings for the judges, and ten &s;hillings for the &s;heriff,</HI> and other par|ticulars as by the &s;aid bill appeareth, and that which makes it the greater extortion is, that the whole bill of co&s;t was exacted of every one of them, which each of them mu&s;t pay down, or be kept pri&s;oners till they did, though all &s;even of them were jointly informed again&s;t in one infor|mation.</Q> Thus Mr. <HI>Hinckley.</HI></P>
<P>The cry of poor widows and fatherle&s;s is gone up to hea|ven again&s;t them on this account; for the probate of a will and letter of admini&s;tration above fifty &s;hillings hath been extorted out of the hands of the poor, nay they have been &s;ometimes forced to pay more than four pounds, when not much above a crown had been due. Let <HI>Andrew Sergeant</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Quilter</HI> among many others &s;peak if this be not true, who were compelled to travel two hundred miles for the probate of a will, and to pay the unrea&s;onable and op|pre&s;&s;ive fees complained of.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e things, under Sir <HI>Edmund</HI>'s government they had wicked ways to extort money when they plea&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Wil|liam Coleman</HI> complains (and hath given his oath according|ly) that upon the &s;uppo&s;ed hired evidence of one man he &s;u&s;|tained
<PB N="39" REF="012973_0038_0F903FF896A0A210">
forty pounds damage in his e&s;tate. And there were complaints all over the country that Sir <HI>Edmund's exci&s;e men</HI> would pretend &s;ickne&s;s on the road, and get a cup of drink of the ho&s;pitable people, but privately drop a piece of mo|ney, and afterwards make oath that they bought drink at tho&s;e hou&s;es, for which the innocent per&s;ons were fined mo&s;t unrea&s;onably, and which was extorted from them, though the&s;e villanies were declared and made known to tho&s;e then in power. <HI>William Goodhue,</HI> and <HI>Mary Dennis</HI> might be produced as witne&s;s hereof, with many more. Some of Sir <HI>Edmund</HI>'s creatures have &s;aid, that &s;uch things as the&s;e made <HI>his government to &s;tink.</HI> Al&s;o <HI>John Hovey</HI> and others com|plain of &s;u&s;taining ten pounds damages by the extortion of officers, though never any thing (they could hear of) was charged upon them to this day, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;toper O&s;good</HI> complain of their being &s;ent to pri&s;on nine or ten days, <HI>with|out a mittimus, or any thing laid to their charge,</HI> and that af|terwards they were forced to pay exce&s;&s;ive charges&mdash;It would fill a volume, if we &s;hould produce and in&s;ert all the <HI>affida|vits</HI> which do confirm the truth of the&s;e complaints.</P>
<P>In the time of that unhappy government, if the officers wanted money, it was but &s;eizing and impri&s;oning the be&s;t men in the country for no fault in the world, and the greedy officers would hereby have gri&s;t to their mill. Thus was Major <HI>Appleton</HI> dealt with. Thus Captain <HI>Brad&s;treet.</HI> Thus that worthy and wor&s;hipful gentleman <HI>Nathaniel Sal&s;tori&s;tal,</HI> E&s;|quire, was &s;erved by them and <HI>barbarou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted,</HI> with|out any information or crime laid to his charge; for he had done nothing worthy of bonds, but it was the plea&s;ure of Sir <HI>Edmund</HI> and &s;ome others, thus to abu&s;e a gentleman far more honourably de&s;cended than him&s;elf, and one concerned in the government of <HI>New-England</HI> before him, but (to his eternal renown) one who refu&s;ed to <HI>accept of an illegal and arbitrary commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> when in the reign of the late king <HI>James</HI> it was offered to him.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een a whole jury of complaints which con|cur in their verdict again&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his con|federates. Were the&s;e things to be heard upon the place, where the witne&s;&s;es who gave in their <HI>affidavits</HI> are re&s;ident, they would amount to legal proof, as to every particular which was by <HI>the agents of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony in</HI> New-England objected again&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e,</HI> and others &s;eized and &s;ecured by the people there.</P>
<P>Moreover there are other matters referring to Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> which cau&s;ed great, and almo&s;t univer&s;al jealou&s;y of
<PB N="40" REF="012973_0039_0F903FF98EC82630">
him. For fir&s;t, His commi&s;&s;ion was &s;uch as would make any one believe that a courtier in the time of the late king <HI>James</HI> &s;poke true, who &s;aid Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e was &s;ent to</HI> New-England <HI>on purpo&s;e to be a plague to the people there.</HI> For he with three or four more, none of them cho&s;en by the people, but rather by that <HI>implacable enemy who pro&s;ceuted the</HI> quo warranto's <HI>again&s;t their charters,</HI> had power given them to make laws, and rai&s;e what monies they &s;hould think meet for the &s;upport of their own government, and he had power him&s;elf alone to &s;end the be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful men a thou&s;and miles, (and further if he would) out of the country, and to build cities and ca&s;tles (in the air if he could) and demoli&s;h them again, and make the pur&s;es of the poor people pay for it all. Such a commi&s;&s;ion was an un&s;ufferable grievance, and no hone&s;t Engli&s;hman would ever have accepted of it, or acted by it.</P>
<P>Secondly, Jealou&s;ies were augumented by his involving the country in a war with the Indians, by means whereof he hath occa&s;ioned the ruin of many families and plantations; yea the death or captivity of we know not how many &s;ouls. <HI>For he went (with the</HI> Ro&s;e <HI>frigate, and violently &s;eized, and took and carried away, in a time of peace all the hou&s;hold goods and merchandi&s;es of</HI> mon&s;ieur Cakeen <HI>a Frenchman at</HI> Penob&s;cot <HI>who was allied to the Indians</HI> having married the daughter of one of their <HI>princes</HI> whom they call <HI>Sagamores</HI> or <HI>Sachems;</HI> and when this was done, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, and was generally concluded that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> would &s;oon be upon the Engli&s;h, as it quickly came to pa&s;s. After the flame was kindled, and barbarous outrages commited by the Indians, Sir <HI>Edmund</HI>'s managery was &s;uch as filled the coun|try with greater fears of an <HI>horrid de&s;ign.</HI> For bloody Indians whom the Engli&s;h had &s;ecured, were not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, but rather courted than puni&s;hed by him.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It cannot be expre&s;t what ju&s;t and amazing fears &s;ur|prized the people of <HI>New-England</HI> when they had notice of the late <HI>king James</HI> being in <HI>France,</HI> le&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> who&s;e governor and confident he was, &s;hould betray them into the power of the <HI>French king,</HI> other circum&s;tances con|curring to &s;trenghen the&s;e fears. The <HI>Mohawks</HI> and other Indians were in ho&s;tility again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> and it was very advantagious to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t to have it &s;o, but Sir <HI>Edmund cau&s;ed them to make a peace with the French,</HI> where|by the French intere&s;t in tho&s;e parts was &s;trengthened, and the Engli&s;h weakened. Mr. <HI>Peter Reverdy</HI> (a French pro|te&s;tant) in his <HI>memoirs</HI> concerning Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> com|plains of this.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="012973_0040_0F903FFC401D2CC0">After that Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e and his accomplices</HI> were &s;ecured, &s;uch reports and informations came to hand, as made <HI>New-England</HI> admire the divine providence in accompli&s;h|ing what was done again&s;t the late oppre&s;&s;ors. They then &s;aw the per&s;ons from whom they &s;u&s;pected the greate&s;t dan|ger, were now incapable of betraying them.</P>
<P>If an unaccountable in&s;tinct and re&s;olution had not an|imated the inhabitants in and about <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to &s;eize on tho&s;e few men, the people there believe <HI>New-England</HI> would have been in the hands not of <HI>king William</HI> but <HI>king Lewis e'er this day:</HI> For in <HI>Sept.</HI> 1689, &s;everal ve&s;&s;els belonging to <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> were taken near <HI>Can&s;oe</HI> in <HI>America</HI> by &s;ome French men of war. The pri&s;oners &s;ince at liberty, inform, that the French told them, that there was a fleet of &s;hips bound from <HI>France</HI> directly for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> but &s;ome of them were taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips of war, and three or four of them lo&s;t at <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and that Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> had &s;ent to the French king for them to come over, and the country &s;hould be delivered up. And the Lieutenant of a French man of war profe&s;&s;ed, that if Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> had not been impri&s;oned, they would then have gone to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> This &s;hews what a good opinion the French had of him, and &s;uch reports &s;o te&s;tified made a &s;trange impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pirits of the people throughout the country: And that the world may &s;ee we do not write fictions of our own, the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Af|fidavits</HI> are produced and here in&s;erted.</P>

<P><PB N="44" REF="012973_0043_0F903FFF437F8DB8">But as to one of the crimes objected again&s;t Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his accomplices, <HI>Habemus confitentem reum.</HI> Mr. <HI>Palmer cannot deny but that they levied monies on the king's &s;ubjects in</HI> New-England, <HI>contrary to the fundamentals of the Engli&s;h government,</HI> which doth not allow the impo&s;ition of taxes without a <HI>parliament.</HI> The <HI>New-Englanders</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that their late oppre&s;&s;ors had been guilty of no le&s;s than a capital crime by their rai&s;ing money in &s;uch a way as they did; and we are a&s;&s;ured that one of them after he received, and before he acted by virtue of his illegal commi&s;&s;ion from the late king, profe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>if ever he had an hand in rai&s;|ing a penny of money without an a&s;&s;embly, his neck &s;hould go for it;</HI> and yet no man that we know of had a deeper hand in it than this per&s;on had. But Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> for the ju&s;tifi|cation of this &s;o foul a bu&s;ine&s;s, lays down &s;everal po&s;itions which he would have no man deny; one of his po&s;itions is. <HI>That it is a fundamental point con&s;ented to by all chri&s;tian na|tions, That the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of a country inhabited by in|fidels, gives a right and dominion of that country to the prince in who&s;e &s;ervice and employment the di&s;coverers were &s;ent.</HI> The&s;e are his words, p. 17. We affirm, that this <HI>fundamen|tal point</HI> (as he calls it) is not a <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> but <HI>an unchri&s;tian principle.</HI> It is controverted among the School-men, <HI>an domi|nium fundatur in grati&acirc;. Papi&s;ts are</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> is) for the <HI>affirmative,</HI> but the <HI>&s;cripture teaches us to believe</HI> that the hea|then nations, <HI>and the &s;ons of Adam,</HI> and not <HI>the children of I&s;rael</HI> only, have a right to the earth, and to the inheritance which God hath given them therein, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.8. When Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> hath proved that <HI>infidels</HI> are not the <HI>&s;ons of Adam,</HI> we &s;hall con&s;ent to his notion, that chri&s;tians may invade their rights, and take their lands from them, and give them to whom they plea&s;e, and that the <HI>pope</HI> may give all <HI>America</HI> to the <HI>king of Spain.</HI> But let him know, that the fir&s;t plan|ters in <HI>New-England,</HI> had more of con&s;cience and the fear of God in them, than it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> hath. For they were not willing to <HI>wrong the Indians in their properties;</HI> for which cau&s;e it was that they purcha&s;ed from the natives their right to the &s;oil in that part of the world, notwith|&s;tanding what right they had by virtue of their charters from the kings of <HI>England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI>'s po&s;ition is clearly a|gain&s;t <HI>Jus Gentium &amp; Jus Naturale,</HI> which in&s;tructs every man, <HI>Nemini injuriam facers.</HI> He that &s;hall violently, and without any ju&s;t cau&s;e take from infidels their lands, where they plant, and by which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t does them manife&s;t in|jury. And let us know of Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> if <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> princes
<PB N="45" REF="012973_0044_0F90400023C4EFC8">
have power to di&s;po&s;e of the lands belonging to <HI>infidels</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> whether they have the like dominion over the lands belonging to the <HI>infidels in the Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and if the&s;e <HI>infidels</HI> &s;hall refu&s;e to con&s;ent that &s;uch <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s their lands, that then they may lawfully <HI>vi &amp; armis</HI> expel or de&s;troy them, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did! We may &s;end Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> for further in&s;truction in this point to <HI>Balaam's a&s;s,</HI> which ingenuou&s;ly acknowledged that her ma&s;ter (though an infidel) had a property in, and right of dominion over her, <HI>Numb.</HI> 22.30. But this <HI>gentleman</HI> hath &s;ome other <HI>a&s;&s;ertions</HI> which he would have us take for <HI>po&s;tulata,</HI> and then we &s;hall be his <HI>&s;laves</HI> without all peradventures. He tells us in page 17, 18, 19, that the <HI>Engli&s;h plantations (in parti|ticulur</HI> New-England) <HI>are no parts of the empire of</HI> England, <HI>but like</HI> Wales <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>which were conquered, and be|long to the dominion of the crown of</HI> England, <HI>and that there|fore he that wears the crown, may &s;et up governments over them, which are de&s;potick and ab&s;olute, without any regard to</HI> Magna Charta, <HI>and that whereas in</HI> Barbadoes, Jamaica, Virginia, <HI>&amp;c. they have their a&s;&s;emblies, that is only from the favor of the prince, and not that they could pretend right to &s;uch privileges of Engli&s;hmen.</HI></P>
<P>And now we need no further <HI>di&s;covery of the man.</HI> Could the people of <HI>New-England</HI> who are zealous for Engli&s;h li|berties ever endure it long, that &s;uch a per&s;on as this &s;hould be made one of their <HI>judges,</HI> that by &s;queezing of them, he might be able to pay his <HI>debts?</HI> And can any rational man believe, that per&s;ons of &s;uch principles did not <HI>tyrannize</HI> over that people when once they had them in their cruel clutches, and could pretend the authority of the late king <HI>James</HI> for for what they did? in our opinion Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> hath not done like a wi&s;e man thus to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the ju&s;t re&s;ent|ments and indignation of all the <HI>Engli&s;h plantations.</HI> If ever it &s;hould be his chance to be among&s;t them again, what could he expect but to be looked on as <HI>communis ho&s;tis,</HI> when he thus openly declares that they have no Engli&s;h liberties belong|ing to them? &mdash; That worthy gentleman Sir <HI>William Jones</HI> (who was <HI>Attorney General</HI> in the reign of king <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd) had certainly more under&s;tanding in the law than Captain <HI>Palmer,</HI> and yet Captain <HI>Palmer</HI> (we &s;uppo&s;e) is not ignorant that when &s;ome propo&s;ed, that <HI>Jamaica</HI> (and &s;o the other plantations) might be governed without any a&s;&s;embly, <HI>that excellency Attorney</HI> (not like Captain <HI>Palmer</HI> but like an Engli&s;hman) told the then king, <HI>that he could no more grant a commi&s;&s;ion to levy money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> without their

But except Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> and the re&s;t of that crew will &s;ay, that his and their <HI>domineering</HI> a while was a <HI>conque&s;t,</HI> they were never yet a <HI>conquered people.</HI> So that his alledging the ca&s;e of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> before Eng|li&s;h liberties were granted to them, is an impertinent &s;tory. Be&s;ides, he forgets that there was <HI>an original contract</HI> between the king and the fir&s;t planters in <HI>New-England,</HI> the king promi&s;ing them, if they at their own co&s;t and charge would &s;ubdue a wilderne&s;s, and enlarge his dominions, they and their po&s;terity after them &s;hould enjoy &s;uch privileges as are in their charters expre&s;&s;ed, of which that of not having taxes impo&s;ed on them without their own con&s;ent was one. Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> and his <HI>brethren oppre&s;&s;ors</HI> will readily reply, their <HI>charter</HI> was condemned. But he cannot think, that the judgment again&s;t their charter made them cea&s;e to be <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen.</HI> And only the colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> had their charter condemned. And yet the&s;e men ventured to levy monies on the king's &s;ubjects in <HI>Connecticut colony.</HI> For the which <HI>inva&s;ion of liberty and property</HI> they can never an&s;wer. Indeed they &s;ay the corporation of <HI>Connecticut &s;urrendered their charter.</HI> But who told them &s;o? It is certain, that no one belonging to the government there, knoweth of any &s;uch thing; and how their oppre&s;&s;ors &s;hould know that <HI>Conne|cticut</HI> made a &s;urrender of their charter when the per&s;ons con|cerned know nothing of it, is very &s;trange. We can produce that written by the &s;ecretary of that colony with his own hand, and al&s;o &s;igned by the pre&s;ent governor there, which declares the contary to what the&s;e men (as untruly as boldly) affirm.

<P>Thus did Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI> and his creatures, who were deeply concerned in the illegal actions of the late un|happy reigns, contrary to the laws of God and men, com|mit a rape on a whole colony; for which violence it is hoped they may account, and make reparation (if po&s;&s;ible) to tho&s;e many who&s;e properties as well as liberties have been inva|ded by them.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Palmer</HI> in the clo&s;e of his <HI>partial account of New-England</HI> entertains his readers with an <HI>harangue</HI> about the <HI>&s;in of rebellion,</HI> and mi&s;applies &s;everal &s;criptures that &s;o he might make the world believe that the people of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> have been guilty of wicked <HI>rebellion</HI> by their ca&s;ting off the arbitrary power of tho&s;e ill men who invaded liberty and property to &s;uch an intolerable degree as hath been proved again&s;t them.

But &s;ince he hath thought meet to take a &s;piritual weapon into his hand, let him know that the &s;cripture &s;peaks of a lawful and good <HI>rebellion,</HI> as well as of that which is unlawful. It is &s;aid of good <HI>Hezekiah that he re|belled again&s;t the king of A&s;&s;yria and &s;erved him not,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.7.

pure exerci&s;e of the prote&s;tant religion,</HI> but he intimates that they will be <HI>termed a land full of hypocri&s;y and rebellion, ir|religion, and a degenerate wicked people,</HI> p. 39. And is this the <HI>&s;incerity and chri&s;tian moderation</HI> which he boa&s;ts him&s;elf of in his preface? Surely the&s;e are the <HI>hi&s;&s;ings of the old &s;erpent,</HI> and do &s;ufficiently indicate who&s;e children the men are that u&s;e them.

He knows that on the fir&s;t notice of their maje&s;ties being proclaimed <HI>king</HI> and <HI>queen</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> both tho&s;e now in government in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the body of the people with them, did (without any command) of their own accord, with the greate&s;t joy proclaim their maje&s;ties in <HI>New-England.</HI> He knows that their ma|je&s;ties have no &s;ubjects more cordialy and zealou&s;ly devoted to them than tho&s;e in <HI>New-England</HI> are, or that do with greater fervor pray for their long and happy reigns, or that are more willing to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t hazards in their &s;ervice, and yet this man that knoweth all this, to ca&s;t an <HI>odium</HI> on that loyal and good people, in&s;inuates as if they were <HI>rebels,</HI> and <HI>di&s;affected</HI> to the pre&s;ent government, and de&s;igned to &s;et up an <HI>independent common wealth,</HI> and had <HI>no regard to the laws of God or men.</HI> After this lying and malicious rate hath he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. What rational charity can be extended &s;o far as to believe that it is po&s;&s;ible for him to think that what him&s;elf hath written is true? When <HI>Sanballat</HI> wrote that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and the Jews with him <HI>intended to rebel,</HI> did he believe what he had written? no, he did not, but <HI>feigned tho&s;e things out of his own heart.</HI> The like is to be &s;aid of tho&s;e <HI>Sanballats</HI> that accu&s;e the people

<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE particulars mentioned in the en&s;uing <HI>narrative,</HI> are but a &s;mall part of the grievances ju&s;tly complained of by the people in <HI>New-England,</HI> during their three years oppre&s;&s;ion under Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e.</HI> For a more full account, the reader is referred to the ju&s;tification of the revolution in <HI>New-England,</HI> where every particular exhibited again&s;t Sir <HI>Ed|mund</HI> and his accomplices, by the agents lately &s;ent to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> is by the <HI>affidavits</HI> of hone&s;t men confirmed. If &s;ome men find them&s;elves thereby expo&s;ed to the ju&s;t re&s;entments and indignation of all true chri&s;tians, or true Engli&s;hmen, they mu&s;t thank them&s;elves for publi&s;hing &s;uch untrue accounts as that which goes under the name of Captain <HI>John Palmer</HI>'s, and that &s;candalous pamphlet called <HI>New-England's Faction di&s;covered,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by an implacable enemy of all good men, and a per&s;on that for impudence and lying has few equals in the world. This which follows, being &s;igned by &s;everal gentlemen of great integrity, who likewi&s;e had a particular knowledge of the things by them related, is therefore of unque&s;tionable credit. The de&s;ign in making of it thus public, is to vindicate their maje&s;ties loyal &s;ubjects in <HI>New-England,</HI> and to give a true repre&s;entation of things unto tho&s;e who have by fal&s;e relations been impo&s;ed on.</P>

<P>HAVING received from Mr. <HI>Addington</HI> by order of the <HI>Council and repre&s;entatives of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony</HI> a &s;ignification of their de&s;ire; That whereas we where mem|bers of the late council in the time of Sir <HI>Edmund Andro&s;&s;e</HI>'s

<HI>Government,</HI> we would give &s;ome information of the <HI>grie|vances and male-admini&s;trations</HI> under the &s;ame. Upon con|&s;ideration had thereof, and in an&s;wer thereunto, we cannot but own and declare, that <HI>not only our&s;elves and many others in the &s;ame &s;tation</HI> (not now pre&s;ent to join with us) were of a long time much <HI>di&s;&s;ati&s;fied and di&s;couraged with very many of the proceedings and admini&s;trations in the &s;aid government;</HI> and had little rea&s;on to wonder that &s;o great a number of the people were &s;o too. It might well have been expected that the go|vernor (not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful heretofore) notwith&s;tanding the ex|traordinarine&s;s (to &s;ay no more) of many clau&s;es and powers in his commi&s;&s;ion; yea the rather and the more, becau&s;e thereof would have cautioned and moderated the execution of the &s;ame: But to our great trouble we found it very much otherwi&s;e. Many were the things that were account|ed irregular and grievous therein, far from conducing to the public weal of the territory, and not a little to the di&s;&s;ervice of the crown, as tending rather to the di&s;turbing and di&s;af|fecting of the &s;ubjects here, than to the furtherance of that chearful obedience, loyalty, love and duty in them, which ought by all good means, to have been nouri&s;hed and pro|moted. And of all this unhappine&s;s, we mu&s;t reckon the fir&s;t &s;tep and in-let to be that <HI>the governor did</HI> &s;o quickly neglect the great number of the council, and <HI>chiefly adhere unto and govern by the advice</HI> only of a few others, the principal <HI>of them &s;trangers to the country, without e&s;tates or intere&s;t therein to oblige them, per&s;ons of known and declared prejudices again&s;t us, and that had plainly laid their chiefe&s;t de&s;igns and hopes to make unrea&s;onable profit of this poor people.</HI> Innumerable were the evil effects that from hence were continually growing up among&s;t us; <HI>the debates in council were not &s;o free as ought to have been,</HI> but too much over-ruled, and a great deal of har&s;hne&s;s continually expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t per&s;ons and opinions that did not plea&s;e. <HI>The greate&s;t rigour and &s;everity was too often u&s;ed towards the &s;obere&s;t &s;ort of people,</HI> when any thing could be found or pretended again&s;t them, their humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions were little regarded, and <HI>inexorable per&s;ecutions order|ed again&s;t them,</HI> whil&s;t in the mean time <HI>the notorious viciou&s;|ne&s;s and profanene&s;s of others met not with</HI> the like <HI>di&s;counte|nance,</HI> but per&s;ons of &s;uch a character were put into places of bu&s;ine&s;s and tru&s;t. The long &s;ettled maintenance of the pub|lick mini&s;try, even from tho&s;e that applied them&s;elves to no other way of wor&s;hip, but continued ordinary hearers, could not be upheld by any act of authority providing for the &s;ame, and &s;chools of learning &s;o well taken care of formerly, were
<PB N="53" REF="012973_0052_0F904007F3F12A38">
in mo&s;t places fallen to decay, and many more &s;uch like might be reckoned up. But we &s;hall more e&s;pecially in&s;tance fur|ther in the particulars following, as not the lea&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was as we thought a great &s;light put upon the coun|cil, and to the prejudice of the good people of the territory, that whereas at the governor's fir&s;t coming a committee ap|pointed thereunto by him&s;elf, and a full council had with great care and &s;everal weeks trouble revi&s;ed a very con&s;ider|able number of orders and laws collected out of the &s;everal law-books of the&s;e colonies found by long experience very needful and agreeable to the good of the&s;e plantations, which laws &s;o collected and revi&s;ed, were again pre&s;ented unto, and upon further advi&s;ement approved by the governor and council and pa&s;&s;ed. Yet upon the introducing Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> from <HI>New-York</HI> to be deputy &s;ecretary, they were, for what cau&s;es we know not, totally laid a&s;ide, and the people denied the benefit of them. And this grievance was &s;o much the great|er, and a plainer indication of the &s;everity of &s;ome men in their intended management of things, becau&s;e on good deli|beration they had al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an order of council, that until the council &s;hould take further order, the &s;everal ju&s;tices, town-officers, and others &s;hould proceed according to former u&s;ages, and &s;uch local laws in the &s;everal parts of this domi|nion, as are not repugnant to the laws of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> Yet becau&s;e by virtue of the &s;aid order &s;ome in authority have proceeded to put forth their power for the &s;upport of the mini&s;try, and &s;ome others did ju&s;tify them&s;elves in &s;ome actions done by them that were not plea&s;ing; hereupon when a di&s;cour&s;e only, and &s;ome debate thereof had pa&s;&s;ed in council, but <HI>without any regular determination made,</HI> and contrary to the expre&s;s word of the &s;aid order, <HI>it was entered in the council-book</HI> concerning it, re&s;olved that the &s;ame was only in force till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the council, and &s;o deter|mined as null of it&s;elf, and that none pre&s;ume to act pur&s;u|ant to &s;uch laws as are or &s;hall be made here.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whereas</HI> the act for the continuing and e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;everal rates, duties and impo&s;ts, was one of the fir&s;t of &s;o great moment that came out in a form under the &s;eal of the territory, and was publickly proclaimed, we that were pre&s;ent have great cau&s;e to remember what trouble and di&s;&s;atisfaction there was among the members of the council concerning the &s;ame. As that act was framed and urged upon us, <HI>a very con&s;iderable number (and we believe we were
<PB N="54" REF="012973_0053_0F9040095125E480">
the major part) di&s;&s;ented</HI> from and argued much again&s;t it. And though the governor expre&s;&s;ed not a little heat and po&s;itivene&s;s alledging his in&s;tructions, and held the council together, un|rea&s;onably a very long time about it. Yet when we did at la&s;t break up we could not imagine that he could take the bill to be agreed to; <HI>neverthele&s;s it was the next day (to our wonderment) brought in fairly engro&s;&s;ed in parchment, and quickly &s;igned by the governor without any counting of voices</HI> either then or the day before, which was the more needful be|cau&s;e &s;ome did continue &s;till to make their objections, others that had &s;poken again&s;t the bill the day before, declaring their adherence to what they had then &s;aid; and many more under &s;o great di&s;couragement and di&s;countenance, as was manife&s;ted &s;itting &s;ilent, which we are &s;ure in the regu|lar pa&s;&s;ing of laws can never be reckoned for a con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The way</HI> and manner u&s;ed afterwards of propo&s;ing and pa&s;&s;ing all laws was very uncertain and unequal, not an&s;wer|able to the nature of &s;o great a power, nor to the largene&s;s of the territory that was to be obliged by them, or to the num|ber of the councellors appointed therein; for after a little while there were no &s;et times appointed or given notice of for the making of laws, that &s;o the members of the council might attend in a fuller number to be helpful therein. Bills of the greate&s;t concernment were u&s;ually fir&s;t con&s;ulted and framed in private, and &s;o unexpectedly brought into council at any time, and then our work too was often under great di&s;ad|vantages, not to advi&s;e freely and con&s;ult about the making of a law thought nece&s;&s;ary, but to maintain a conte&s;t in oppo&s;ition to a very inconvenient one, too far promoted and engaged in already; and above all, <HI>there was never any fair way of taking and counting the number of the councellors con&s;enting and di&s;&s;enting,</HI> that &s;o the majority might be known in any matter that admitted of any con&s;iderable rea&s;onings and debates, by rea&s;on whereof both laws and other orders and re&s;olutions might be &s;et down as pa&s;&s;ed by the council, which ought not to have been. And when it hath been (as often it was) ex|pre&s;ly and earne&s;tly prayed when matters of greater moment than ordinary were in hand, that the debate and re&s;olution of them might be put off till a fuller council of members from other &s;everal parts of the dominion might be convened &s;uch motions were ever di&s;accepted, and entertained with no little di&s;placency; <HI>&s;o that it might be too truly affirmed, that in effect four or five per&s;ons, and tho&s;e not &s;o favourably inclined and di&s;po&s;ed as were to be wi&s;hed for, bear the rule over, and
<PB N="55" REF="012973_0054_0F90400A70D5ADB0">
gave law to a territory the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of any belonging to the dominion of the crown.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In pur&s;uance</HI> of this way and manner of pa&s;&s;ing laws a|bove expre&s;&s;ed, there were two in &s;pecial that came forth, which we are &s;ure in fuller and freer councils would have had a full &s;top put to them; <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> The act for regu|lating the choice of &s;elect-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherein the liberty of towns to meet for the managing of their publick affairs re|ferring to their common lands, and all other their concern|ments, which they had enjoyed for &s;o many years, to their great benefit, was mo&s;t unrea&s;onably re&s;trained to once a year, and all other convening of inhabitants as a town meeting, upon any pretence or colour what&s;oever, was &s;trictly forbidden: And the other act was that intituled, an act requiring all ma&s;ters of &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els to give &s;ecurity, in which there were &s;uch re&s;traints laid upon all per&s;ons from tran&s;porting them&s;elves freely (as their occa&s;ion might call) out of their territory, that it would have been a meer pri&s;on to all that &s;hould be found therein, and &s;uch bond required of all &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els (extending in the practice even to &s;hallops and wood-boats) as would quickly have intolerably di&s;couraged, if not ruined the trade thereof; and all without any other ordinary gene|ral benefit of the &s;aid act, but the filling &s;ome men's poc|kets with fees: And (as it might be thought from the time of moving this act, which was when Captain <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> was already gone, and Mr. <HI>Mather was known to be intending for</HI> England) <HI>the ob&s;tructing of &s;uch men's going home as were like|ly there to make ju&s;t complaints, and &s;eek redre&s;s of publick grie|vances;</HI> and when this act had been &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed in council here at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where it was more than once vehe|mently urged, and as often denied, <HI>it was carried as far as</HI> New York, <HI>and there an opportunity found for the obtaining of it.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The</HI> great matter of properties and titles to our lands is the next to be in&s;i&s;ted on, his maje&s;ty that granted the charter did fully inve&s;t the patentees with right to the &s;oil through|out the whole limits thereof, and here on the place, the right of the natives was hone&s;tly purcha&s;ed from them. The di&s;|po&s;al, di&s;tribution, and granting of lands by the patentees, who were al&s;o incorporated, and made a body politick, was in &s;uch a plain, ready, ea&s;y way, without any charge to the planters, as in the &s;ettlement of &s;o large a country was thought to be mo&s;t agreeable: And &s;o much of a publick
<PB N="56" REF="012973_0055_0F90400A9719C5C8">
&s;pirit and de&s;ign were tho&s;e noble gentlemen, that (though well they might) they &s;ettled not one &s;ingle penny of &s;ervice or acknowledgment to them&s;elves and heirs of any of their grants, a thing &s;o &s;elf-denying and worthy, that few in&s;tances can be given of the like. All which notwith&s;tanding, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, de&s;cents and valuable purcha&s;es of &s;o many years that have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince, <HI>the governor and tho&s;e he ad|hered to re&s;olved and practi&s;ed to make all men's titles in effect quite null and void.</HI> The purcha&s;ing of the natives right, was made nothing of, and next to a ridicule. The enjoy|ment and improvement of lands not inclo&s;ed, and e&s;pecially if lying in common among&s;t many was denied to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; it was not enough that &s;ome men that thought it convenient, and were both willing and able, did take confir|mations of their lands, the numbers of whom in time might have been a con&s;iderable gain to them; but <HI>nothing would &s;a|tisfy unle&s;s all in general might be compelled &s;o to do; hence tho&s;e that refu&s;ed were declared intruders upon his maje&s;ty, and put in fear of having their lands granted unto &s;trangers.</HI> Many were &s;olicited, and encouraged to petition for other men's lands, and had a &s;hameful example &s;et them by &s;ome of the chief contrivers of all this mi&s;chief. <HI>When &s;ome men have pe|titioned for a confirmation of their own lands, a part of the&s;e only was offered to be granted to them, and another part denied.</HI> Nor could any man's own land be confirmed to him, without a particular &s;urvey of every part and parcel of them fir&s;t made, the great charges whereof, and of other fees to be taken would have been to mo&s;t men in&s;upportable: <HI>Yea it hath by &s;ome been computed that all the money in the country would not &s;uffice to patent the lands therein contained.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And yet further,</HI> a con&s;iderable quit-rent to the king was to be impo&s;ed upon all lands, though already a con&s;tant yearly tax for the &s;upport of the government had been laid on them.</P>
<P><HI>And for</HI> all this mo&s;t unrea&s;onable vexation to a laborious and indu&s;trious people, the only ground pretended was &s;ome defects and wants of form and due manner alledged to be in the way of the di&s;po&s;ing and conveying of all lands from the patentees to the town&s;hips and people here; which whatever it amounted to might have been ea&s;ily remedied, either by an application and repre&s;entation to the king for the obtain|ing a general &s;ettlement of all properties (which would have been highly worthy and generous for the governor to have engaged in, on behalf of the people) or by &s;ome other ways
<PB N="57" REF="012973_0056_0F90400B4F3B94F8">
that were propo&s;ed. But nothing but the way of particular patenting as above&s;aid could prevail. In pro&s;ecution where|of all actions intended upon informations of intru&s;ions in his maje&s;ty's behalf, or between old proprietors and new grantees mu&s;t have had their deci&s;ion at the ordinary courts of common law here upon the place where matters of e|quity and of a con&s;ideration tran&s;cending all ordinary ca&s;es could not have a proper cognizance and due influence in the deci&s;ion, determination and judgment.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Though</HI> &s;ufficient courts of ju&s;tice were appointed, and held in the &s;everal counties for the trial of all offenders, yet it <HI>was too frequent upon more particular di&s;plea&s;ure to fetch up per&s;ons from very remote counties before the governor and coun|cil at Bo&s;ton</HI> (who were the highe&s;t, and a con&s;tant court of record and judicature) not to receive their tryal but only to be examined there, and &s;o remitted to an inferior court to be farther proceeded again&s;t. <HI>The grievance of which court was exceeding great,</HI> for hereby not only the charge was made exce&s;&s;ive upon &s;uch per&s;ons by the <HI>notorious exactions of the me&s;&s;enger,</HI> the &s;ecretary's fees for examination, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the&s;e examinations them&s;elves were unrea&s;onably &s;trict, and rigor|ous and very unduly di&s;paring to plain unexperienced men. <HI>And</HI> the trials of &s;everal, were by this means over-ruled to be at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and not in the proper counties, and were other|wi&s;e &s;o far prejudged as to be rendered le&s;s equal.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> extraordinary oppre&s;&s;ive fees taken in all matters by indigent and exacting officers, the&s;e were at the fir&s;t for a long time arbitrarily impo&s;ed and required without any co|lour of an e&s;tabli&s;hment of them by the council. Afterwards a committee was appointed, to bring in a table of fees, that &s;pent a long time without fini&s;hing any thing, the rea&s;on whereof was becau&s;e &s;ome therein <HI>e&s;pecially the deputy &s;ecre|tary We&s;t,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon fees much more extraordinary than &s;ome others could con&s;ent to. In conclu&s;ion; there was a table of fees drawn up to be pre&s;ented to the council, and &s;igned by &s;ome of the committee, one of whom, (who&s;e &s;ub|&s;cription is to this paper) declaring expre&s;ly, that by his &s;igning he did no otherwi&s;e agree, but only that it might be pre&s;ented to the council, to do therein as they &s;hould &s;ee cau&s;e, who al&s;o when it was &s;o pre&s;ented to the council, de|clared that many of the particulars in that table contained, were unrea&s;onable, and ought to be abated, and of this mind
<PB N="58" REF="012973_0057_0F90400C9F2528E8">
were many others. But the entry after the u&s;ual manner was an approbation thereof.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly.</HI> As to tho&s;e <HI>great jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions of &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns in the governor as to our troubles by the Indians,</HI> we have to &s;ay, That although divers things too uncertain, if not untrue have been too ea&s;ily reported and &s;pread concern|ing him, a practice which &s;ome of us have formerly with no little prejudice to our&s;elves di&s;countenanced and borne te&s;|timony again&s;t; yet <HI>there have not wanted &s;ome other parti|culars that might give too great a ground for the &s;ame.</HI> The principal of them (as far as we have any knowledge of things of that kind) are the&s;e.</P>
<P>The governor's <HI>&s;eizing and taking away the goods of Mon|&s;ieur St.</HI> Ca&s;tine <HI>of</HI> Penop&s;cot, the &s;ummer before the war broke forth, which thing hath been e&s;teemed not a little to have &s;tirred up and furthered the &s;ucceeding troubles. The governor's not ha&s;tening his return to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> when the&s;e troubles were actually begun, but lengthening out his tarrience in places &s;o remote till the ho&s;tility of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the great mi&s;chiefs thereof were too far advanced. That during his ab|&s;ence he was not plea&s;ed &s;ufficiently to impower and in&s;truct any to act things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the out plantations and the pro&s;ecution and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the enemy, tho' he had &s;peedy and true accounts from time to time &s;ent him of all that happened. That all that was done to this purpo&s;e in a ca&s;e of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity, either by the lieutenant governor, or by the ju&s;tices of the peace, and military officers in many places, by &s;ecuring and di&s;arming of neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;et|ting up, warding and watching, garri&s;oning &s;everal hou&s;es for the &s;ecurity of the inhabitants, e&s;pecially the women and chil|dren, in ca&s;e of &s;udden inroads and &s;urprizings that might be, &s;ending &s;ome relief of men to &s;ome places that were mo&s;t in danger, and al&s;o what was done by tho&s;e members of the council that were at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in conjunction with the com|mander in chief left in the &s;ort there, who rai&s;ed and &s;ent &s;ome forces to <HI>Ca&s;co-Bay,</HI> where greate&s;t harms were done. We &s;ay, that all that was thus done, was &s;o extreamly di&s;approv|ed of by the governor upon his return back from <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> and an unaccountable di&s;plea&s;ure manife&s;ted again&s;t all per&s;ons that had &s;o acted, and that he was ready to call them to an account as high offenders for the &s;ame, and refu&s;ed a long time, though much &s;olicited, to give any order concern|ing the &s;oldiers &s;ent to <HI>Ca&s;co,</HI> either for the continuance of them there, where they were very nece&s;&s;ary, or for their di&s;mi&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="59" REF="012973_0058_0F90400CC609C6C0">
home. Unto all which may be added the governor's &s;ending me&s;&s;engers both <HI>John Smith</HI> the quaker from <HI>Albany,</HI> and &s;oon after Major <HI>Macgregory</HI> to <HI>Keybeck</HI> upon &s;uch errands and bu|&s;ine&s;s as were not communicated and laid open to the council. And further, <HI>his relea&s;e and &s;etting at liberty &s;undry</HI> Indians <HI>that were in hold, &s;ome of them known enemies to the</HI> Engli&s;h, and particularly objected again&s;t by &s;everal of the council, and that without any exchange of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> captives then in the enemies hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief matters which upon this occa&s;ion (with|out any undue prejudice again&s;t any man, or de&s;ign to ju&s;tify the defects of our&s;elves in the performance of our own &s;hares of duty, but in an&s;wer to the de&s;ire &s;ignified to us as above) we have to &s;et forth, profe&s;&s;ing truly that by &s;uch a &s;tate of things as we had the experience and feeling of, the places that we held were rendered exceeding unea&s;y to us, and that out of a &s;incere re&s;pect to the pro&s;perity of the&s;e their maje&s;ties plantations, we could not but be very de&s;irous that through the favour of God and our &s;uperiors, all due redre&s;s might in a good happy &s;ea&s;on be obtained; and the way of governing <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects in their maje&s;ties dominions without an a&s;|&s;embly of the people's repre&s;entatives bani&s;hed out of the world for ever.</P>
