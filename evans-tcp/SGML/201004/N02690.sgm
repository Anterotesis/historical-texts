<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DR. COTTON MATHER,</HI> tho' Born and con&s;tantly Re&s;iding in this remote Corner of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> has yet for near the&s;e <HI>Forty</HI> Years made &s;o ri&s;ing &amp; great a Figure in the Learned World, as has attracted to Him while alive, the Eyes of many at the furthe&s;t Di&s;tance; and now decea&s;ed can't but rai&s;e a very general Wi&s;h to &s;ee the Series, and more e&s;pecially the Do|me&s;tick part of &s;o Di&s;tingui&s;hing a <HI>LIFE</HI> exhibited. His printed Writings &s;o full of Piety and various Erudition, his va&s;t Corre&s;pondence, and the continual Reports of Travellers who had conver&s;ed with Him; had &s;pread his Reputation into other Countries: And when about <HI>Fourteen</HI> Years ago I travelled abroad; I cou'd not but admire to what Extent his Fame had reached, and how inqui&s;itive were Gentlemen of Letters to hear and know of the mo&s;t particular and lively Manner both of his private Conver&s;a|tion and publick Performances among us.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> indeed, as a <HI>REVEREND FATHER</HI> with us has agreably ob&s;erved <NOTE PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. COLMAN in his Funeral Sermon.</NOTE>. &mdash; <Q>His <HI>Printed Works</HI> will not convey to Po&s;terity, nor give to Strangers a ju&s;t Idea of the real Worth and great Learning of the Man. His <HI>Works</HI> will indeed inform all that read them, of his great Knowledge and &s;ingular Piety, his Zeal for <HI>GOD</HI> and Holine&s;s and Truth, and his De&s;ire of the Salvation of precious Souls: But it was <HI>CONVERSATION</HI> and Acquaintance with
<PB N="2" REF="003188_0008_0FF0135978ACFCC8">Him, in his familiar and occa&s;ional Di&s;cour&s;es and private Communications, that di&s;covered the va&s;t Compa&s;s of his Knowledge, and the Pro|jections of his Piety, more I have &s;ometimes tho't than all his Pulpit Exerci&s;es. <HI>Here</HI> He excell'd, <HI>Here</HI> He &s;hone; being exceedingly com|municative, and bringing out of his Trea&s;ures things new and old without mea&s;ure. <HI>Here</HI> it was &s;een how his Wit and Fancy, his Invention, his Quick|ne&s;s of Tho't and ready Apprehen&s;ion, were all con&s;ecrated to <HI>GOD,</HI> as well as his Heart, Will and Affections: And out of his Abundance within, his <HI>Lips</HI> overflowed, drop'd as the Honey|comb, fed all that came near Him; and were as <HI>the choice Silver,</HI> for Richne&s;s and Brightne&s;s, Plea&s;ure and Profit.</Q></P>
<P><HI>EVERY</HI> one who intimately knew the <HI>DOCTOR,</HI> will readily &s;ub&s;cribe to this De&s;cription. By his learned Works and Corre&s;pondence tho&s;e who lived at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance might di&s;cover much of his &s;uperiour Light and Influence: But they cou'd di&s;cern the&s;e only by a more mediate and faint Reflection: They cou'd neither &s;ee nor well imagine that <HI>extraordinary Lu&s;tre</HI> of pious and u&s;e|ful Literature, wherewith we were every Day entertained, &s;urpriz'd and &s;atisfied, who dwelt in the directer Rays, in the more immediate Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>GREAT</HI> Abilities, and in&s;atiable Thir&s;t for all kinds of Knowledge, an extraordinary Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, Liveline&s;s of Fancy, with a ready Invention and Active Spirit, &s;eemed to be the chief Ingredients of his <HI>Natural Genius:</HI> And all the&s;e being &s;anctified in his early Days, indued with a divine Bya&s;s and turned to the noble&s;t Objects; He became inflamed with the mo&s;t ardent De&s;ires to ama&s;s unto Him&s;elf from all &s;orts of Writings, an unbounded Trea&s;ure of curious and u&s;eful Learn|ing, and to find out all imaginable Ways of im|ploying it, for the Glory of <HI>GOD,</HI> the Good of <HI>Men,</HI> and the Advancement of <HI>his own</HI> Perfection: Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> grew in Knowledge, He might increa&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and U&s;efulne&s;s, and become a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003188_0009_0FF0135CFB5A1398">
<HI>So</HI> much <HI>Erudition,</HI> &s;uch high Degrees of <HI>Piety,</HI> and &s;uch an <HI>Active Life</HI> in doing Good, united in the &s;ame Per&s;on, are very rarely &s;een among the Sons of Men. By a tran&s;ient Acquaintance with Him, one wou'd think, that being &s;anctified from the Birth, He had made the utmo&s;t Improvement of his Time in the <HI>PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE:</HI> But upon a further View of the Social Part of his Life, the continual Re&s;ort of Vi&s;itants, with his gentle and ea&s;y Entertainment of 'em at all Hours, and how He wou'd &s;carce let the Meane&s;t or Younge&s;t pa&s;s Him without In&s;truction; It &s;eem'd as if almo&s;t all his Time were &s;wallowed up with <HI>CONVERSATION:</HI> And yet, being let into a more intimate Di&s;covery of his numberle&s;s and perpetual Contrivances and Labours to do Good in the World; one wou'd then be ready to con|clude that he cou'd have no Time left for <HI>Either,</HI> but mu&s;t have &s;pent it all in <HI>ACTION.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HAVING</HI> made Him&s;elf an Early Ma&s;ter of the Learned Languages, One of the &s;pecial <HI>ME|THODS</HI> by which he &s;o well improv'd his Time and acquir'd &s;uch a va&s;t Extent of Science &s;eem'd to be; that tho' for his Progre&s;s in Divine Li|terature, He kept to the con&s;tant Study of the <HI>SACRED ORACLES</HI> in their in&s;pired Originals, yet for <HI>Other Writings</HI> he cared not to trouble Him&s;elf with any but tho&s;e that were likely to bring him &s;omething <HI>New,</HI> and &s;o increa&s;e his Knowledge. In two or three Minutes turning thro' a Volumn, he cou'd ea&s;ily tell whether it wou'd make Ad|ditions to the Store of his Ideas. If it cou'd not, He quickly laid it by: If otherwi&s;e, he read it, pa&s;&s;ing over all tho&s;e Parts which contained the things he had known before, peru&s;ing tho&s;e Parts only that repre&s;ented &s;omething <HI>Novel,</HI> which he Pencil'd as he went along, and at the End re|duc'd the Sub&s;tance to his <HI>Common Places,</HI> to be review'd at Lei&s;ure; and all this with wonderful Celerity. So &s;hort a Cour&s;e he took to univer&s;al Science &mdash; that as he increa&s;ed in Years, the le&s;s <HI>Time</HI> he had occa&s;ion to expend in running thro' an
<PB N="4" REF="003188_0010_0FF0135F6B4992D0">Author; till at length there were but few Books publi&s;hed that would take him <HI>much</HI> to read, and many that were celebrated for their various Learn|ing he found had little in them but what he had been acquainted with before.</P>
<P><HI>NOR</HI> were his <HI>Common-Places</HI> the only Trea|&s;uries of his rich Ideas: They were but more Securities that He might not lo&s;e them: And He us'd to have them at command on the mo&s;t &s;udden Incidents, and in common Conver&s;ation, which had therefore always &s;omething new, and was ever entertaining and in&s;tructive. By this means it was that He had the mo&s;t agreable and effectual way of <HI>Reproving</HI> a Friend for what appear'd ami&s;s, or of <HI>Exciting</HI> to a neglected Duty, that I ever met with. In&s;tead of doing this directly, which might have been too Offen&s;ive, He wou'd rather bring &s;ome Hi&s;tory or Ob&s;ervation in the Form of a plea&s;ant <HI>Narrative,</HI> which He had ready at hand for all Occa&s;ions; and being extreamly &s;uitable, wou'd leave his Friend to the mo&s;t pungent Application.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> his glowing <HI>CHARITY</HI> and <HI>PIETY</HI> &s;pread a further Lu&s;tre on his other Excellencies. His burning Zeal for <HI>GOD,</HI> and fervent Benevolence and Love for <HI>Men,</HI> were continually working in Him, imploying all his Talents, Tho'ts and Cares, by Night and Day, and Breaking forth into num|berle&s;s Projections, and inten&s;e Indeavours, which wa&s;ted and con&s;um'd his Life. He was an utter Enemy to religious Tyranny and Impo&s;ition: He was of very Catholick and Comprehen&s;ive Prin|ciples: He never valued any particular Forms of Wor&s;hip, unle&s;s they were of Divine Appointment: But it was the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Power,</HI> the <HI>Practice</HI> of the great Duties of Religion in the <HI>CHRISTIAN</HI> In&s;titution that his Heart was &s;et on: And this He was for Propagating, by convincing and moving Arguments, warm Per&s;wa&s;ions, bright Examples, and by every winning Way that cou'd be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of, agreable to its truly primitive and noble Simplicity, and to Humane Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003188_0011_0FF0136208794020">
<HI>THE following Draughts</HI> will give the Publick an entertaining Specimen of his wonderful Improve|ment of Time, and the various and &s;urprizing Me|thods He invented and pur&s;ued for the Advance|ment of this vital Piety, both in Him&s;elf &amp; Others. Tho' deliberate in Speech, yet expeditious in Indi|ting; and having the Pen of a ready Writer, that knew not how to faulter in its &s;wift career; He continually pre&s;erved <HI>Records</HI> of the &s;everal Rules and Schemes He formed for his own Direction, and of his diurnal Pro&s;ecutions of them. He has by this means left a great Abundance of excellent Materials for his more private Hi&s;tory: And the Accounts that follow being extracted chiefly from them, are al&s;o agreable to that Part of his Life which fell under the Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e who were acquainted with Him; and &s;o nearly an&s;wered to the&s;e <HI>latent Rules</HI> now publi&s;hed, that we cou'd not but conclude He had them always in his Eye, tho' we had never &s;een them.</P>
<P><HI>HIS</HI> Son, the Compiler having the&s;e great Ad|vantages, can have therefore no Occa&s;ion to invent any Additions to his Dear Father's Hi&s;tory. He has rather aimed at <HI>Brevity,</HI> and to write as little upon every Head as po&s;&s;ible. And indeed, if He had Publi&s;hed all that his Written Memorials would have enabled him, or that him&s;elf and others have been Witne&s;&s;es of, He had not only &s;well'd the Volumn to too large a &s;ize for the pre&s;ent Age to bear, and thereby hurt its U&s;efulne&s;s; but he mu&s;t have al&s;o given &s;uch a full Account of this extraordinary Per&s;on as would have exceeded the Belief of tho&s;e who were Strangers to Him. The very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re Narra|tion would have rather looked like the celebrated Life of <HI>CYRUS,</HI> and be di&s;puted by Po&s;terity whether it were de&s;ign'd and drawn for a mixt Romance, or a real Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> native Fondne&s;s of a <HI>filial Mind</HI> for a Father's Honour, may give Occa&s;ion for the Reader to &s;u&s;pect, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Prai&s;e. But if &s;ome other Pens had been imploy'd i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w|ing the De&s;cription of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Character, I
<PB N="6" REF="003188_0012_0FF01364EF48C838">am very certain they would have given them&s;elves a greater Liberty, as not being quite &s;o cautious of exceeding as a natural Relative. And for other things, the ingenuous Reader will rather indulge the blooming Offspring of &s;o Great a Parent; E&s;pecially, when the <HI>Fir&s;t Fruits</HI> he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ecrates to the Publick u&s;e, are &s;o rich and &s;alutary as the&s;e before us.</P>
<P><HI>BUT</HI> now, Methinks, I have need of &s;ome good <HI>Apology</HI> for my own Pre&s;umption to Preface the Life of &s;uch a Man, and recommend it to the World. I have none but this, &mdash; That the now Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Subject</HI> of it having been plea&s;ed to admit me into an happy Intimacy with Him, upon my Return to this my Native Country; I have been thereby too highly obliged &mdash; to deny the De&s;ires of his <HI>Orphan Son,</HI> that I wou'd introduce him thus into the Publick view, and from my own Experience &s;ay &s;o much as may in &s;ome mea&s;ure move the curious Pa&s;&s;enger, to turn a&s;ide and look into this reflecting Mir|rour, and with plea&s;ing Wonder contemplate the Great Original.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> to &s;ay no more, &mdash; I cannot think to wi&s;h a richer <HI>BLESSING</HI> in the pre&s;ent State of the Prophetick Sy&s;tem; than that the <HI>GOD of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h,</HI> would in my own dear Country, and every Other, rai&s;e up Numbers of &s;uch Mini&s;ters as this, and pro&s;per this Superiour Example for the forming and animating of them: That they may burn and &s;hine as He, and prepare the World for the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Appearance of the <HI>GREAT GOD</HI> our Saviour <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> that <HI>SUN of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &mdash; the boundle&s;s and flowing Source of all the infinitely lower Excellence and fainter' Brightne&s;s we in every Place and Age, admire in Others.</P>

<P>_IT is agreed by <HI>all,</HI> that <HI>Lives</HI> of eminent Men are very profitable, and that the <HI>Writing</HI> of them is of great U&s;e to the World; e&s;pecially if their <HI>Examples</HI> have bin very &s;hining, and they have <HI>&s;erved</HI> their <HI>Generation according to the Divine Will;</HI> and therefore it is that &s;o many <HI>Ancients</HI> and <HI>Moderns</HI> have endeavoured to tran&s;mit thro' Ages down to the late&s;t Po&s;terity the <HI>Lives</HI> &amp; Actions of their vertuous and excellent Friends.</P>

<P N="1">1. DR. <HI>COTTON MATHER</HI> &mdash; He was born Thur&s;day <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. 1662, 3. at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I have no great Di&s;po&s;ition to en|quire into the <HI>remote Antiquities</HI> of his Family; nor indeed is it matter of much Con&s;e|quence that in our <HI>Coat of Arms,</HI> we bear <HI>Ermine,</HI> Or, <HI>A Fe&s;s,</HI> Wavy, Azure, three Lions rampant; or, for a Cre&s;t, on a wreath of our Colours a <HI>Lion Sedant,</HI> or on a Trunk of a Tree <HI>vert;</HI> &mdash; The <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> found in the Family was the mo&s;t agreeable Plea&s;ure to <HI>my Father,</HI> and yields the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory Reflection to me.</P>

<P N="3">3. HIS <HI>Mother</HI> was MARIA, the Daughter of the Renowned Mr. JOHN COTTON; who was a Man of very exalted <HI>Piety</HI> and uncommon <HI>Learning:</HI> Out of Re&s;pect to this excellent Man, He was called COTTON.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. 2.</HI> His Education, his Eagerne&s;s and Progre&s;s in Learning; and early Favours confer'd on him.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HIS Education was at the free School in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> under the Care, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of Mr. BENJA. THOMP|SON, a Man of great Learning and Wit, who was well acquainted with <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, and a good Poet <HI>la&s;t</HI> under the famous Mr. EZEKIEL CHEEVER, who was a very learned, pious Man, and an excellent School-ma&s;ter. Under the&s;e two Ma&s;ters he made a laudable Proficiency.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY <HI>twelve</HI> years of Age, he had compo&s;ed many <HI>Latin</HI> Exerci&s;es, had conver&s;ed with TULLY, TE|RENCE, OVID and VIRGIL, had gone thro' his <HI>Greek Te&s;tament,</HI> and entred upon ISOCRATES, HOMER and his <HI>Hebrew Grammar;</HI> and at that Age was admitted into <HI>College.</HI> The pious Dr. HOAR, who was then Pre&s;ident, according to Cu&s;tom, gave him this <HI>prophe|tical</HI> Head for his initial Declamation,
<Q>Telemacho <HI>veniet, vivat modo, fortior Aetas.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. AFTER his entrance into <HI>College,</HI> he made as quick a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;patch as before; Ma&s;tering <HI>Hebrew</HI> per|fectly dige&s;ting ALEXAN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Many are the Books which he then
<PB N="5" REF="003188_0027_0FF0138F97109250">read with ingenious Remarks, of which he kept an Account in his <HI>Diary.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN he took his fir&s;t Degree, which was at the Age of <HI>Sixteen,</HI> Mr. OAKES the Prae&s;ident, in his Oration at the Commencement which I have read, thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf concerning this hopeful Youth,</P>

<P>YOU will find in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory, that this great Mans Sentiments were ju&s;t, and his Expecta|tions an&s;wered: So that I may now in&s;ert the true Character of him, when he made &s;ome Figure in the World; which I chu&s;e to bring in here, becau&s;e it has &s;ome Relation to Prae&s;ident OAKS'S Prophecy.</P>
<P>A Friend thus writes of him;</P>

<P N="5">5. WHEN he was half a Year &s;hort of <HI>Nineteen,</HI> he proceeded <HI>Ma&s;ter of Arts,</HI> and received his Degree at the Hand of his Father who was then Prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dent.

<HEAD><HI>Sect. 3.</HI> His Early Religion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is an excellent Maxim, That <HI>the be&s;t Gifts are vain unle&s;s Piety adorn them:</HI> And of this Mind was he, of whom I am writing, from his very Child|hood.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003188_0029_0FF01394E6B685C0">
AND, altho' his De&s;ire of Learning was very great and &s;trong, and his Attainments were truly con&s;ider|able, he was not more noted for the&s;e <HI>Gifts</HI> than for his early <HI>Piety</HI> and Religion.</P>
<P>FROM his earlie&s;t Days there were &s;everal <HI>good things found</HI> in him. When he began to &s;peak almo&s;t, he began to <HI>pray,</HI> and practi&s;ed this Duty con&s;tantly while he was a School-Boy; and, altho' he u&s;ed no <HI>Forms</HI> in Secret, he compo&s;ed &s;ome for his School-Fellows &amp; obliged them to pray. Before he could write notes of Sermons <HI>in public</HI> A&s;&s;emblies, he commonly wrote what he remembred when he came home. &mdash; He read the <HI>Scriptures</HI> with &s;o much <HI>Ardor</HI> and A&s;&s;i|duity, that <HI>fifteen Chapters</HI> a Day divided into three Exerci&s;es, and nothing le&s;s, would &s;uffice him. &mdash; He would moreover reprove his Play-mates for their wicked Words and Practices.</P>
<P N="2">2. As he grew Elder, he joined him&s;elf to a <HI>Society of Young Men</HI> that met on the <HI>Sabbath Evening</HI> for Religious Ends and Purpo&s;es; and unto the&s;e Meet|ings he a&s;cribed his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Ri&s;e and Improvement in the Art of <HI>Speaking,</HI> of <HI>Praying,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. BY Rea&s;on of &s;ome Mi&s;carriages into which he was &s;urprizingly bro't, he was very Young put upon enquiring into his E&s;tate; whether he were not an <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> if not a <HI>Ca&s;t-away?</HI> He found very frequent Returns of <HI>Doubts</HI> and <HI>Fears;</HI> and therefore re&s;olute|ly and frequently renewed his <HI>Clo&s;ure with</HI> JESUS CHRIST, as his <HI>only Relief</HI> again&s;t them. During <HI>this</HI> time, when he was langui&s;hing under the Sen&s;e of his Vilene&s;s, and thinking with him&s;elf, <HI>Will the</HI> LORD <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of one that has done and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in as I have?</HI> I &s;ay during this time, he tho't it proper to open his Bo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to his Father: Upon &s;o doing his Father told him, <HI>There was no Sinner repenting and returning but</HI> CHRIST <HI>will accept of him: For</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>ob&s;erve it even among Men; there is a vile Sinner; a good Man beholds and abhors him: Yet if</HI> this <HI>Man ever
<PB N="8" REF="003188_0030_0FF013969AC79740">becomes a new Creature, the &s;ame good Per&s;on, not|with&s;tanding his former Vilene&s;s, will embrace him and take him to his Bo&s;om; and this</HI> (continued he) <HI>is an Emblem and Effect of the Spirit of</HI> JESUS. &mdash; Wonderful was the Quickning the&s;e Words gave him: They influenced his Addre&s;&s;es to Heaven, in which he then had &s;weet and &s;trong Intimations of the <HI>Di|vine Favour.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN he was <HI>fifteen,</HI> he was much affected by reading Dr. HALL'S Treati&s;e of <HI>Meditation,</HI> with his Propo&s;als of proceeding <HI>Methodically</HI> in this <HI>great Duty of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> Upon this, He read &s;everal <HI>other</HI> Books upon <HI>that</HI> Subject, and made many E&s;&s;ays at a <HI>Logical</HI> and regular Method for daily Me|ditation, and proceeded &s;o far that he wrote a Di&s;cour&s;e upon that Subject, which at this tender Age found a good Con&s;ideration among &s;everal ingenious Friends. The Re&s;ult of all was, that he finally pitched upon <HI>this Method.</HI> The Meditation con&s;i&s;ted of two Parts: In the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> He proceeded more <HI>doctrinally,</HI> to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> him&s;elf either with an&s;wering a <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> or with explaining a <HI>Scripture,</HI> or with con&s;idering the <HI>Cau&s;es, the Effects, the Adjuncts, the Oppo&s;ites</HI> and <HI>Re&s;em|blances</HI> of the Thing that was his <HI>Theme.</HI> &mdash; In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Part, he proceeded more <HI>practically</HI> to affect him&s;elf in three Steps; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> an <HI>Examination</HI> of him|&s;elf; <HI>next,</HI> an <HI>Expo&s;tulation</HI> with him&s;elf and <HI>la&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> in the Strength of Grace offered in the new Covenant. This happy way of <HI>preaching with and unto him&s;elf</HI> he was acquainted with betimes.</P>
<P N="5">5. AND before this, even at <HI>fourteen</HI> Years of Age, he began to keep <HI>Days of Fa&s;ting and Prayer</HI> alone in his Study, and in tho&s;e Duties he made at fir&s;t SCUDDER'S <HI>Chri&s;tian's Daily Walk</HI> his Directory; &amp; But of his <HI>Fa&s;ts</HI> (together with his <HI>Thanksgiving</HI>) and his Devotions &amp; Methods in them, I treat largely in Chap. 6. whither I refer my Reader.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="9" REF="003188_0031_0FF01399B0302E80">
6. HAVING pa&s;t his fir&s;t <HI>Sixteen</HI> Years, he was tho't of Age eno' to join to a <HI>particular Church:</HI> He did &s;o then accordingly, and renewed his <HI>Bapti&s;mal Vows</HI> and Covenant. By approaching to the LORD'S <HI>Table,</HI> he tho't him&s;elf obliged to be very particular in <HI>Self Examination.</HI> I will here tran&s;cribe one In&s;tance of his <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> which he wrote when &s;hort of <HI>Seventeen.</HI></P>
<P>Setting my &s;elf upon the Work of <HI>Self-Exami|nation,</HI> I find;</P>
<P N="1">1. Concerning my <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>I am convinced of the utter In&s;ufficiency in my own <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to procure my <HI>Salvation.</HI> I &s;ee my own <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to be <HI>nothing</HI> in point of Acceptance with GOD. I &s;ee a woful <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> has acted me, <HI>Sluggi&s;hne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> hath at|tended me, in the very be&s;t of all my Services.</P>
<P>I perceive now no other way for my <HI>Salvation,</HI> but only by the Lord JESUS CHRIST; <HI>Refuge</HI> &s;ails el&s;ewhere on every Hand.</P>
<P>I behold a <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> &amp; a <HI>Beauty</HI> in JESUS CHRIST; HE is worth loving, worth prizing, worth <HI>follow|ing.</HI></P>
<P>Such is my De&s;ire to obtain an Intere&s;t in HIM, and make HIM the only Portion and Support of my Soul, that it is one of my greate&s;t Griefs, to find my Heart &s;o dull in going forth after HIM.</P>
<P N="2">2. Concerning my <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>I abhor <HI>Sin,</HI> becau&s;e it is abhorred by GOD and contrary to HIM.</P>
<P>SIN is my <HI>heavy Burden: Death</HI> it &s;elf would be welcome to me to free me from &s;uch a <HI>Burden.</HI></P>
<P>I am <HI>heartily troubled</HI> for the Sin in my <HI>Heart,</HI> and that fountain of Corruption, <HI>the Plague of my Heart</HI> afflicts me.</P>
<P N="3">3. Concerning my <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>I long to &s;ee and know the <HI>Favour of GOD</HI> unto me; the &s;ight of <HI>That</HI> would make all my Afflictions light.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire to be as active as may be in promoting the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD; and I &s;eldome come into any

<P>I am &s;orry, that I <HI>love</HI> GOD no more.</P>

<P>A Mean Per&s;on with <HI>Grace</HI> is more amiable to me than another who is otherwi&s;e never &s;o well qualified, but <HI>Gracele&s;s</HI> &mdash; There are &s;ome other of his <HI>Examinations,</HI> when in <HI>Younger</HI> Years and in <HI>advanced,</HI> which you will find in the 6th Chapter of this Book: I brought this one in here, as a Specimen of his early Sen&s;e of Religion.</P>

<P>THE Maxim he went upon was this, that <HI>a</HI> Power <HI>and</HI> Opportunity <HI>to do Good not only gives a</HI> Right <HI>to the Doing of it, but al&s;o makes the Doing of it a</HI> Duty: A Maxim truly noble and divine both <HI>in it &s;elf,</HI> and in its <HI>Effects!</HI> And it is built upon tho&s;e Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles, <HI>As we have Opportu|nity, let us do Good unto all Men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. VI. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING a Principle of <HI>Good-Will</HI> to Man deeply rooted in his Soul, he was <HI>very &s;oon</HI> and very &s;trongly de&s;irous that it might grow and flouri&s;h, and that others might be the better for it.</P>
<P>HE fir&s;t &s;et him&s;elf to contrive what Good he might be able to do in his <HI>Father's Family,</HI> by in&s;tructing his Brethren and Si&s;ters, and by exhorting the Ser|vants.</P>
<P>HE anon proceeded to impo&s;e it as a Rule upon him&s;elf, never to come into any Company where it
<PB N="11" REF="003188_0033_0FF0139EB28ADBA8">might be proper for him to <HI>di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> but he would, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o order it that <HI>it</HI> might be &s;erviceable to the Company; and, he &s;aw the Fulfilment of that Promi&s;e, <HI>To him that has &s;hall be given:</HI> For, upon his faithful Improvement of his Talents, He found his LORD and Ma&s;ter went on and multiplied his <HI>Op|portunities,</HI> untill he came to &s;erve whole <HI>Churches, Towns and Countries.</HI></P>
<P>FROM his own happy <HI>Experience</HI> therefore, when he was advanced in Age, he would often advi&s;e <HI>Young Men,</HI> to contrive and &s;tudy as early as po&s;&s;ible <HI>to do Good,</HI> to love it and to account it a noble Thing. While <HI>We</HI> and our <HI>Opportunities</HI> are but <HI>&s;mall,</HI> he would have us <HI>invent</HI> as many ways as we can to be &s;erviceable: He would not have us impertinent, im|mode&s;t or o&s;tentatious in our E&s;&s;ays; but would have us with humility, and yet with Readine&s;s, <HI>begin be|times</HI> with our <HI>&s;mall Stock,</HI> and expect that, before we have done, GOD will do <HI>great things</HI> for us as well as by us. I have made &s;ome Digre&s;&s;ion; but the <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of it will make Amends for it. I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion hereafter more particularly to mention his <HI>great U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> and exten&s;ive Labors.</P>
<P N="8">8. HE very young tho't it his Duty to give unto <HI>the LORD of all,</HI> &s;ome <HI>part</HI> of &s;mall &s;ub&s;tance which was afforded him. Even from 14 he devoted a <HI>Tenth</HI> to our <HI>Melchizedek;</HI> and from his Childhood was very good, manly and generous.</P>
<P>I will mention but <HI>two In&s;tances</HI> here of his good Spirit and <HI>Charity;</HI> (having Occa&s;ion e're long to give you &s;ome <HI>more</HI>) you will take them in his own Words;</P>
<Q><P>It may not be ami&s;s now and then to mention a <HI>Remarkable Providence,</HI> and make &s;ome Remarks on the <HI>retaliating Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> of Heaven towards me. One thing, that I will ob&s;erve, is what I met with in the <HI>twenty fir&s;t</HI> Year of my Life. I can tell that the LORD has mo&s;t notably, in many In&s;tances
<PB N="12" REF="003188_0034_0FF013A1D61C2FD0">retaliated my Dutifulne&s;s unto my <HI>Father.</HI> Some of the In&s;tances which I have taken Notice of may &s;eem trivial, but yet the <HI>Retaliation</HI> I &s;aw in 'em gave them a <HI>Reli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>As now, I was Owner of a <HI>Watch,</HI> which I was fond of for the Variety of <HI>Motions</HI> in it. I &s;aw my Father took a Fancy to <HI>it,</HI> and I made a Pre&s;ent of it unto him, with &s;ome Tho'ts that as it was but a peice of due Gratitude unto &s;uch a Parent, &s;o I &s;hould not go without a Recompence. Quickly after this there came to me a Gentlewoman, from whom I had no Rea&s;on to expect &s;o much as a Vi&s;it: But in her Vi&s;it, &s;he, to my Surprize pray'd me to accept, as a Pre&s;ent from Her, a <HI>Watch,</HI> which was indeed preferible to that, with which I had parted. I re&s;olved hereupon to &s;tir up <HI>Duti|fulne&s;s unto Parents</HI> in my &s;elf and others more than ever.</P>
<P>At another Time; I bought a <HI>Spani&s;h Indian</HI> Servant, and be&s;towed him upon my Father.

7. I will conclude Sect. 4. with reciting &s;ome <HI>&s;pe|cial Rules,</HI> which He ob&s;erved in the <HI>Education of his Children.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HE pour'd out continual <HI>Prayers</HI> to the <HI>GOD of all Grace</HI> for <HI>them,</HI> That HE would be a <HI>Father</HI> to them, be&s;tow HIS <HI>Son</HI> &amp; <HI>Grace</HI> upon them, <HI>guide them</HI> by his <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> and bring them <HI>to Glory.</HI> And in this Action, He mention'd them <HI>di&s;tinctly,</HI> every one by <HI>Name,</HI> to the LORD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. HE began betimes to entertain them with de|lightful <HI>Stories,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Scriptural</HI> ones: And he would ever conclude with &s;ome <HI>Le&s;&s;on of Piety;</HI> bidding them to learn that <HI>Le&s;&s;on</HI> from the <HI>Story.</HI>
<P>AND thus every Day at the <HI>Table,</HI> He u&s;ed him|&s;elf to tell &s;ome entertaining <HI>Tale</HI> before he ro&s;e; and endeavor to make it u&s;eful to the <HI>Olive-Plants about the Table.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. WHEN his Children accidentally at any Time came in his way, it was his Cu&s;tom to let fall &s;ome <HI>Sentence</HI> or other, that might be monitory or profitable to them.
<P>THIS Matter occa&s;ioned Labor, Study and Con|trivance.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. HE betimes try'd to engage his Children in Ex|erci&s;es of <HI>Piety;</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>&s;ecret Prayer:</HI> For which he gave them very plain and brief Directions, and would &s;ugge&s;t unto them the <HI>Petitions</HI> which he would have them make before the LORD, and which he would therefore explain to their Apprehen|&s;ion and Capacity. And he would often call upon Them; <HI>Child, Don't you forget every Day to go alone and pray as I have directed you.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. HE betimes endeavored to form in his Children a Temper of <HI>Benignity.</HI> He would put them upon doing <HI>Services</HI> &amp; <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es</HI> for one another, and for other Children. He would <HI>applaud</HI> them when he &s;aw them delight in it. He would <HI>upbraid</HI> all Aver|&s;ion
<PB N="16" REF="003188_0038_0FF013AC9D3CAE20">to it. He would Caution them exqui&s;itely again&s;t all <HI>Revenges of Injuries,</HI> and would in&s;truct them to return <HI>good</HI> Offices for <HI>Evil</HI> ones. He would &s;how them, how they would by this <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> become like the Good GOD and the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. He would let them di&s;cern he was not &s;atisfied, except when they had a <HI>Sweetne&s;s of Temper</HI> &s;hining in them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. AS &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, he would make the Children learn to <HI>Write:</HI> And when they had the U&s;e of the Pen, he would employ them in Writing out the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and profitable Things he could invent for them. In this way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> propo&s;ed to fill their Minds with <HI>excellent Things,</HI> which he hop'd would make a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Minds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. HE ince&s;&s;antly endeavoured, that his Children might betimes be acted by Principles of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HE would fir&s;t beget in them an high Opinion of their <HI>Father's Love</HI> to them, and of <HI>his</HI> being be&s;t <HI>able to judge,</HI> what &s;hall be good for them.</P>
<P>THEN he would make them &s;en&s;ible, it was Folly for them to pretend to any <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> or <HI>Will</HI> of their own: They mu&s;t re&s;ign all to <HI>Him,</HI> who would be &s;ure to do what is <HI>be&s;t; his Word</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>their Law.</HI></P>
<P>HE would cau&s;e them to under&s;tand, that it is an <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>&s;hameful</HI> Thing <HI>to do ami&s;s.</HI> He would aggravate this on all Occa&s;ions; and let them &s;ee how <HI>amiable</HI> they will render them&s;elves by <HI>well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t Cha&s;ti&s;ement</HI> which he would inflict for any ordinary Fault, was <HI>to let the Child &s;ee and hear him in an A&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> and hardly able to believe that the Child could do &s;o <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e</HI> a Thing, but believing that they would never do it again.</P>
<P>HE would never come to give a Child a <HI>Blow,</HI> except in ca&s;e of <HI>Ob&s;tinacy,</HI> or &s;omething that is very <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>TO be <HI>cha&s;ed for a while out of his Pre&s;ence,</HI> he would make to be look'd upon as the &s;ore&s;t Puni&s;hment in his Family.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003188_0039_0FF013AEE3B8E5C0">
HE would with all po&s;&s;ible In&s;inuations come upon them to gain this Point, That <HI>to learn all great Things, was the noble&s;t Thing in the World.</HI> He was not fond of propo&s;ing <HI>Play</HI> to them as a <HI>Reward</HI> of any diligent Application, to learn what is good; le&s;t they &s;hould think <HI>Diver&s;ion</HI> to be a better and nobler thing than <HI>Diligence.</HI> He would have them to pro|pound and expect at this rate, <HI>I have done well; and now I will go to my Father, who will teach me &s;ome thing curious for it.</HI> He would have his Children account it a <HI>Privilege</HI> to be <HI>taught;</HI> and would &s;ome|times manage the matter &s;o, that <HI>Refu&s;ing to teach</HI> them &s;omething &s;hould be looked upon as a <HI>Puni&s;h|ment.</HI> The Strain of his <HI>Threatnings</HI> therefore was; <HI>You &s;hall not be allowed to read, or to write, or to learn &s;uch a thing, if you do not as I have bidden you.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Slavi&s;h</HI> way of <HI>Education,</HI> carried on with <HI>Raving</HI> &amp; <HI>Kicking</HI> &amp; <HI>Scourging</HI> (in <HI>Schools</HI> as well as <HI>Families</HI>) he looked upon as a dreadful Judgment of GOD on the World; he tho't the <HI>Practice</HI> abomi|nable, and expre&s;s'd a mortal Aver&s;ion to <HI>it.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. THO' he found a va&s;t, a wonderful Advantage in having his Children &s;trongly bya&s;&s;ed by the Prin|ciples of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &amp; <HI>Honour;</HI> (which he ob&s;erved that Children will feel and under&s;tand &s;ooner than is com|monly tho't for;) yet he would not neglect any Means and Endeavours to have <HI>higher Principles</HI> infu&s;ed into them.</P>
<P>HE would therefore betimes <HI>awe</HI> them with the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Eye of GOD</HI> upon them in the <HI>Ways</HI> which they <HI>take.</HI></P>
<P>HE would &s;how them how they mu&s;t <HI>love our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST; and how they mu&s;t <HI>demon&s;trate</HI> it, by doing what their Parents require of them.</P>
<P>HE would often tell them of the <HI>good Angels,</HI> who love them, help them, guard them from Evil and do many good Offices for them; who likewi&s;e take a very diligent Notice of them, and ought not in any mea&s;ure to be di&s;obliged.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003188_0040_0FF013B148BE53B8">
HE would not &s;ay much to them of the <HI>evil Angels,</HI> becau&s;e he would not have them entertain any fright|ful Fancies about the Apparitions of <HI>Devils:</HI> But yet, he would briefly let them know, that there are <HI>Devils,</HI> who tempt them to Wickedne&s;s, who are glad when they do wickedly, and who may get leave of GOD to kill them for it.</P>
<P><HI>HEAVEN</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> he &s;et before them clearly and faithfully, as the Con&s;equences of their good or bad Behaviour here.</P>
<P N="9">9. WHEN the <HI>Children</HI> were <HI>capable</HI> of it, he would take them <HI>alone</HI> one by one; and after many affectionate, loving, &s;trong <HI>Charges</HI> unto them, to fear GOD, to &s;erve CHRIST and &s;hun <HI>Sin;</HI> he would <HI>pray with them</HI> in his Study, and make them the Witne&s;&s;es of the Agonies and Strong Cries, with which he, on their behalf, addre&s;&s;ed the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P N="10">10. HE found much Benefit, by a particular Me|thod as of <HI>Catechi&s;ing</HI> the Children, &s;o of carrying on the <HI>Repetition</HI> of the public Sermons unto them.</P>
<P>THE An&s;wers of the <HI>Cathechi&s;m</HI> he would explain, with Abundance of brief <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> which make them to take in the whole meaning; and he found by this Way that they did &s;o.</P>
<P>AND when the <HI>Sermons</HI> were to be <HI>repeated,</HI> he cho&s;e to put every <HI>Truth</HI> into a <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> to be An|&s;wered with <HI>Yes</HI> or <HI>No.</HI> In this way he would awaken the <HI>Attention</HI> as well as enlighten the <HI>Under&s;tand|ing</HI> of his Children. And in this way he would take the Opportunity to ask, <HI>Do you de&s;ire &s;uch or &s;uch a Grace of God?</HI> And the like: And in this way, he had Opportunity to <HI>demand,</HI> and perhaps to <HI>obtain</HI> their <HI>early</HI> and frequent (and why not <HI>&s;incere?</HI>) <HI>Con|&s;ent</HI> unto the glorious Articles of the <HI>New-Covenant.</HI> He tho't the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> might fall upon them in this Action, and they might be &s;eiz'd by HIM and held as HIS Temples thro' Eternal Ages. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD it was &s;o with &s;everal of them.</P>

<P>I &s;hall here give you the <HI>Rules</HI> he ob&s;erved in <HI>Conver&s;ing:</HI> They may be ranked under three Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> HE would not affect <HI>Loquacity</HI> in his Di&s;|cour&s;es, but, on the contrary, much <HI>Deliberation.</HI> The <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> accompanying &s;uch a Caution, he beheld as of greater Con&s;equence to one in all Companies, than the Reputation of <HI>Wit;</HI> which by a greater <HI>Volubility</HI> of Tongue might ea&s;ily be ac|quired: And be&s;ides he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">membred <HI>in many Words there wants not Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HE would &s;tudiou&s;ly decline to utter any thing, that he fore&s;aw might be <HI>u&s;ele&s;s;</HI> and much more, every Thing that might be <HI>hurtful</HI> and <HI>&s;inful</HI> to be uttered. It was his Ambition every where to &s;peak <HI>u&s;efully,</HI> and &s;ay only tho&s;e Things that one or other might be the <HI>wi&s;er</HI> or <HI>better</HI> for.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE would, with all the nice <HI>Contrivance</HI> imaginable, improve Opportunities to &s;ay &s;omething or other, that might particularly &s;et off <HI>&s;ome Glories</HI> of his LORD: He would every where contrive, if it were po&s;&s;ible, to let fall &s;ome Sentence or other, by which high Tho'ts of CHRIST might be rai&s;ed in tho&s;e that heard Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. THINKING his <HI>Charitable Di&s;bur&s;ements</HI> may mo&s;t &s;uitably be re&s;erved for the next Chapter; I &s;hall only here give you his <HI>private Sentiments of Chari|tablene&s;s</HI> in his own Words;</P>
<P><Q>I am not unable with a little Study to write in <HI>&s;even Languages:</HI> I fea&s;t my &s;elf with the Sweets
<PB N="21" REF="003188_0043_0FF013B931D3A550">of all the <HI>Sciences</HI> which the more polite Part of Mankind ordinarily pretend unto. I am entertained with all kinds of <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> ancient and modern. I am no &s;tranger to the Curio&s;ities, which by all &s;orts of Learning are brought unto the curious. The&s;e <HI>Intellectual</HI> Plea&s;ures are far beyond any <HI>Sen&s;ual</HI> ones.&mdash; Neverthele&s;s, all this affords me not &s;o much Delight as it does, to relieve the Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of any one poor mean mi&s;erable Neighbour; and much more, to do any exten&s;ive Service for the Redre&s;s of tho&s;e Epidemical Mi&s;eries under which Mankind in general is langui&s;hing, and to advance the Kingdom of GOD in the World.</Q>&mdash; His pri|vate Conduct was con&s;onant with his Sentiments.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT was his watchful De&s;ire and Study, never to maintain a <HI>per&s;onal Quarrel</HI> with any Man breath|ing; but rather deny him&s;elf of his Humor, his E&s;teem, &mdash; or any Thing in the World. His Rea&s;on was, becau&s;e no Man can manage a <HI>per&s;onal Quarrel</HI> without lo&s;ing abundance of precious <HI>Time,</HI> which may be laid out infinitely better in the Service of CHRIST and his Church; be&s;ides a deal of inevitable <HI>Sin,</HI> which will in&s;inuate it &s;elf into every <HI>per&s;onal Quarrel,</HI> by which one's internal Peace is broken. And further, &s;ince we have but a <HI>&s;hort Time</HI> to live in the World, He tho't it fooli&s;h to throw away any of it in Squabbles.</P>
<P N="6">6. CONSIDERING that for Men, even <HI>good Men</HI> to <HI>&s;peak Evil</HI> one of another, is a very evil Thing&mdash;He tho't it would be a con&s;iderable Service to &s;eek the Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Vice or any Vergencies to it in him&s;elf. Wherefore, after Flights to his JESUS for Strength to <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Perform,</HI> he made the&s;e Re&s;o|lutions.</P>
<P>THAT he would never &s;peak <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> of any Man; and that if he &s;pake <HI>Evil</HI> of any Man, it &s;hould be un|der the&s;e Limitations and Regulations.</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IF He <HI>&s;poke</HI> what was <HI>Evil</HI> of any Per|&s;on, he would carefully watch over his Heart, that he did not utter it <HI>with Delight:</HI> He would manage it with Brevity and Aver&s;ion, as a very ungrateful Subject.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> WHEN he mu&s;t, or was obliged to <HI>&s;peak</HI> what is <HI>Evil</HI> of any Man, if he knew of any <HI>Good</HI> that could be &s;poken of him, he would be&s;ure to balance the <HI>Evil</HI> with the mention of the <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> BEFORE he would <HI>&s;peak Evil</HI> of a Man, he would con&s;ider whether he &s;hould not fir&s;t <HI>&s;peak</HI> to him; and, be it how it will, he would ordinarily, <HI>&s;peak</HI> nothing, but what he &s;hould chearfully and contentedly &s;ay in the Hearing of the Man of whom he is talking.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE would aggravate nothing; and when he <HI>&s;poke</HI> of an <HI>Evil</HI> would not make it wor&s;e than it was.</P>
<P>THESE Rules he con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erved.&mdash;Would to GOD, others were &s;o careful as to take a due No|tice of them!</P>
<P N="7">7. BECAUSE he did not love to be di&s;turbed with <HI>tedious &amp; impertinent Vi&s;iters,</HI> and becau&s;e his <HI>Friends (Amici Temporis Fures)</HI> might &s;ometimes <HI>un&s;ea&s;o|nably</HI> interrupt him, he wrote over his <HI>Study Door</HI> in Capitals, BE SHORT.

<P N="9">9.

<P N="11">11. IF he heard that any Per&s;on had done him <HI>wrong</HI> in Word or Deed, he would &s;eldom let him know that he had any Knowlege of it.

13. I will conclude this Section and Chapter with an Account of <HI>two</HI> Books in which he was writing con&s;tantly.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t was his <HI>Quotidiana</HI> (as he call'd it) or <HI>Common-Place Book;</HI> in which he wrote along the remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages in any Author as he read him; but for fear he &s;hould be at a lo&s;s in finding any Pa&s;|&s;age, entred as he found it, he therefore number'd every Quotation, and at the End of his Book had an <HI>Index</HI> of <HI>Names, Things,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o that he could pre&s;ently have Recour&s;e to the Sentences he wanted.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other</HI> Book was his <HI>Diary;</HI> in which he kept an Account of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Articles in which he had <HI>done</HI> his Duty, as well as tho&s;e in which He had been <HI>deficient.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was a German one SEBASTIAN HEINRIC, who, not many Years ago, publi&s;hed for the Cour&s;e of one Year whatever he <HI>did, read</HI> or <HI>&s;aw</HI> for that Year.</P>
<P>MR. MATHER'S <HI>Diary</HI> was not &s;uch a <HI>Medley:</HI> No! There was none but <HI>important</HI> Matters entred into it. I will only take Notice of what I have col|lected in ob&s;erving <HI>one Day,</HI> and <HI>one Year</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I find in one of his Diaries an Account of the Tran&s;|actions of <HI>one Day</HI> as follows. <Q>This Day I per|formed the Duties of my <HI>general Calling, in&s;tructed</HI> the Scholars under my Charge, underwent the Di|ver&s;ion of <HI>Meals</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> with whom I was a con&s;iderable while; I <HI>made</HI> a long Sermon and <HI>preached</HI> it; I &s;pent more than a little Time at the <HI>private Meeting,</HI> where I preached, and read over KNOX'S <HI>Hi&s;torical Relation of the I&s;land of</HI> Ceylon.</Q></P>
<P>IN the Ob&s;ervation of one whole Year of his Diary I took Notice of it,&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT he had preached above <HI>&s;eventy two publick</HI> Sermons, and many <HI>private</HI> ones; perhaps near <HI>half</HI> as many.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003188_0047_0FF013C31B9858A8">
THAT not <HI>one Day</HI> pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome Contri|vance <HI>to do Good</HI> invented and regi&s;tred; be&s;ides, I &s;uppo&s;e, many <HI>never</HI> entred his Memorials.</P>
<P>THAT no <HI>one Day</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed without being able to &s;ay at Night, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his <HI>Revenues,</HI> tho' <HI>&s;mall,</HI> had been dealt out to pious U&s;es.</P>
<P>THAT he had <HI>prepared</HI> and <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> about four|teen Books.</P>
<P>THAT he had kept <HI>&s;ixty Fa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>twenty two</HI> Vigils.</P>
<P>A va&s;t Variety of other Things I find recorded, which I &s;hall omit: I bring this only as a Specimen of his <HI>Diary,</HI> how it was repleni&s;hed and what Pains he took not to &s;pend his Life in vain.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding He took &s;uch Care of &s;pending his Time; yet, I often in his Books find him complaining of his <HI>Deficiencies,</HI> &amp;c. His fir&s;t Years, He calls, <HI>Time &s;o mi&s;pent as to render it un|worthy to be called a</HI> Life; after he was grown in Years, he cho&s;e rather to &s;ay, &s;uch a <HI>Year of his Age</HI> than his Life: On one of his Books I read, &s;uch a <HI>Year of a forfeited Life;</HI> on another Year, of "<HI>my &s;inning again&s;t my precious</HI> REDEEMER": On ano|ther, <HI>"Alas of my Unfruitfulne&s;s"!</HI> On a fourth, <HI>"A Year &s;weel'd away in Sin and Sloth".</HI> So that it might be &s;aid of Him, as was &s;aid of one that was very <HI>exact in his Walk,</HI> that his Life was <HI>perpe|tua Cen&s;ura,</HI> a continual Cen&s;ure of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ALTHO' he thus complains of him&s;elf: it would be happy for the <HI>greate&s;t Part</HI> of the World, if they could give <HI>&s;o good</HI> an Account of their Time and their Talents. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is</HI> &s;uch a <HI>wi&s;e and faithful Servant, who when his</HI> LORD <HI>cometh, is found &s;o doing.</HI></P>
<P>I might under this Chapter have given you a large Account of his <HI>Fa&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. (which belong to this pri|vate Character and Conduct) but I had rather re|&s;erve them, until the 6th Chapter obliges me to pro|duce them.</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> MY <HI>Applauding</HI> of my &s;elf in my Tho'ts, when I have done any thing at all &s;ignificant; <HI>pray'd</HI> or <HI>preach'd</HI> with <HI>Enlargements;</HI> an&s;wered a Que&s;tion readily, pre&s;ently, &s;uitably. <HI>Proud Thot</HI>'s I &s;aw fly-blow'd my be&s;t Performances.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> MY ambitious Affectation of <HI>Pre-eminence</HI> far above what could belong to my Age or worth, and above others that were far more de&s;erving than my &s;elf.</P>
<P>FOR my <HI>Humiliation</HI> I then wrote the&s;e Con&s;i|derations:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHAT is <HI>Pride</HI> but the very <HI>Image of Satan</HI> on the Soul? The more any Man has of CHRIST in him, the more <HI>humble</HI> will he be, more low and vile in his own Eyes and more empty of him&s;elf. When GOD renews HIS <HI>Image</HI> in us, He <HI>pulls down our proud Thot's.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>Pride</HI> is a mo&s;t <HI>natural Sin;</HI> but <HI>Grace</HI> would overcome that in a mo&s;t &s;pecial Manner and Mea&s;ure. And then how little Grace have I? How unlike HIM, that could &s;ay, <HI>I am lowly?</HI> Let me for this Cau&s;e, <HI>ab|hor my &s;elf in Du&s;t and A&s;hes!</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. DO I not by <HI>Pride</HI> offend GOD? it is a Breach of HIS <HI>holy Command</HI> and He often de|clares HIS <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of it. HIS holy SPIRIT is <HI>grieved</HI> by it: And how vehemently does the Scripture caution again&s;t all Tendencies unto it? Shall I bear to think of offending that GOD who
<PB N="30" REF="003188_0052_0FF013D100E92F50">has been a <HI>Father</HI> to me, and whom I have cho&s;en and vow'd to love and &s;erve as my GOD and Fa|ther? Or that SPIRIT, upon the &s;weet Influences of which my Soul does live, <HI>Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. IS not <HI>Pride</HI> a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Madne&s;s</HI> in me? Have I any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for <HI>glorying in my &s;elf?</HI> Do I any Thing <HI>&s;ingular?</HI> Am not I in mo&s;t Attainments <HI>exceeded by mo&s;t</HI> of my Calling and Standing? But, Oh, let this be a Dagger to my Heart! Have I not a <HI>cur&s;ed Na|ture</HI> in me? And hath not the LORD heretofore left me unto &s;ome Follies, the &s;en&s;e of which &s;hould make me <HI>walk &s;oftly and my Days?</HI> LORD, <HI>I am viler than a Bea&s;t before Thee!</HI> Or, why &s;hould I &s;eek <HI>Honor.</HI> 'Tis <HI>not &s;eemly for</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Fool.</HI> Am I fit for <HI>Service?</HI> Or am I not rather <HI>un&s;avory Salt</HI> fit for Nothing but the Dunghil? What am I bet|ter than <HI>the lea&s;t of all Saints?</HI> If in any external Grandeurs I get above any of them, I am by them the more obnoxious to Temptation and Sin an Wrath&punc; <HI>Ly then in the Du&s;t, O my Soul, before GOD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. HOW <HI>dangerous,</HI> how <HI>de&s;tructive</HI> an Evil is this <HI>Pride?</HI> I provoke the GOD of Heaven, to take away every one of tho&s;e <HI>Idols,</HI> which in my fond <HI>Pride,</HI> I dote upon; and if the LORD &s;hould now deprive me of my Capacities &amp; Opportunities, where am I but in an horrible Pit of <HI>Sorrows and Mi&s;eries?</HI> And let me remember, <HI>Pride</HI> will &s;ooner than any Thing drive away the good SPI|RIT of GOD from the Heart of a poor Creature. And if that &s;hould be my Fate, &mdash; <HI>LORD, Have Mercy on me!</HI>&mdash; What a Monument &s;hall I be of thy direful Vengeance? O that the LORD would &s;et home the&s;e Tho'ts for my Humiliation!</ITEM>

<P>BUT what &s;hall I do for the Cure of this Di|&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003188_0053_0FF013D32AEFAB30">
IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and chief place, I would carry my di&s;temper'd <HI>Heart</HI> unto the LORD JESUS, and put it into the Hands of that al&s;ufficient <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> for HIM to ture it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I would be daily watchful again&s;t my <HI>Pride,</HI> &amp; continually keep an Eye upon my Heart, and check the <HI>lea&s;t Beginnings</HI> and <HI>fir&s;t Motions</HI> of this Corruption.</P>

<P>IN one of my Supplications this Day, I thus ex|pre&s;s'd my &s;elf;</P>
<P>LORD, What &s;hall I do for the Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e my <HI>Pride?</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be thy Name, Thou ha&s;t &s;hewed me a <HI>Way,</HI> and bid me <HI>walk</HI> in it.

'Tis becau&s;e I had put my Heart into the Hands of the faithful <HI>JESUS,</HI> and He it is that hath not &s;uffered me to go on unconcerned about the Di&s;temper of my Soul, but hath awakened me to &s;eek Relief at HIS Hands, as I do this Day.&mdash;And now LORD, I come to HIM.

<P>THESE Pa&s;&s;ages were wrote pre&s;enty aftr Mr. MATHER was &s;etled in the Mini&s;try, and therefore I bring them in here. The <HI>Section</HI> is indeed long; but, as I ble&s;s GOD, it has been very profitable to <HI>Me,</HI> I hope it will be acceptable to the <HI>pious Readers,</HI> e&s;pe|cially of the <HI>&s;acred Order.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. I forgot to inform my Reader, That Mr. MA|THER before He was Setled, kept many Days of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> in order to it. And in one of tho&s;e Days, having declared unto GOD, That not expecting any <HI>temporal Advantage,</HI> but rather <HI>Sor|row</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s, Obloquy</HI> and many <HI>Per&s;ecutions,</HI> he would out of <HI>Love</HI> to HIM, undertake the Work before Him, <HI>feed</HI> a precious and numerous Flock of His: He then promi&s;ed the&s;e Things to his LORD;</P>
<P>THAT He would endeavour to be a <HI>faithful Pa&s;|tor</HI> unto tho&s;e over whom he &s;hould be placed.</P>
<P>THAT He would endeavour to be <HI>humble</HI> under whatever <HI>Enlargements</HI> &s;hould be vouch&s;afed unto him.</P>
<P>THAT if GOD &s;hould give him to build up HIS Church with an un&s;potted <HI>Reputation,</HI> he would endeavor to be contented with whatever State &s;hould be ordered for him in the World, tho' never &s;o <HI>Poor</HI> and many other ways afflicted.</P>
<P N="10">10. He was con&s;tant and unwearied in his <HI>public Mini&s;try,</HI> when he was entred into it.&mdash;Sometimes he has preached a Sermon for <HI>eleven Days</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. I need not at large write the <HI>Subjects of his Di&s;cour|&s;es,</HI> his Method of <HI>Studying</HI> &amp; <HI>Preaching,</HI> &s;ince he has given &s;o true a De&s;cription of them in his <HI>Manu|ductio ad Mini&s;terium.</HI> Pago 90, to 98 &amp; 102, to 105.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="33" REF="003188_0055_0FF013D9E17811C8">
11. BUT however I will give my Reader his <HI>Rules of Preaching,</HI> &s;ince they are &s;hort, &s;ince they were tho't upon when he was Young, others may be the better for them, and &s;ince this Book may come into their Hands who have not &s;een the Doctor's <HI>Manu|ductio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> WHEN he was at a lo&s;s for a Text, he would make a Prayer to the Holy SPIRIT if CHRIST for HIS Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as well to <HI>find</HI> a Text for him, as to <HI>handle it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> BEFORE he would undertake to go over any larger <HI>Portion</HI> or <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Bible,</HI> which might require many Sermon, he would with more Solemn Supplications addre&s;s Heaven for nece&s;&s;ary Succours.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE would weigh well the <HI>Original Tongues,</HI> as well as the u&s;ual and needful <HI>Commenta|ries,</HI> for a Scripture before he would preach upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthy,</HI> IN pitching on <HI>Subjects</HI> to be di&s;cour&s;ed in his public Mini&s;try, e&s;pecially more <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> ones, (for which he would re&s;erve him&s;elf a Liberty in what Cour&s;e &s;oever he was) He would ever have &s;ome <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of &s;uiting and &s;erving the Edification of the Hearers;&mdash;ever&mdash;<HI>preach upon De&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE would not <HI>&s;tand long</HI> upon one Text ordinarily, but &s;tudy an acceptable <HI>Variety:</HI> Nor would he u&s;e one way of treating <HI>every Text,</HI> but be various in his Methods.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> HE would be <HI>Scriptural</HI> in all his Exer|ci&s;es; and ordinarily di&s;mi&s;s no Head, without &s;ome place of <HI>Scripture</HI> well adju&s;ted to it.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> HE would always endeavour to <HI>fill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is Hour well</HI> (and he did &s;o) and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roud every Sermon as full of <HI>Matter</HI> as po&s;&s;ible without <HI>Ob&s;curity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> IN uttering his Sermons he was not for <HI>beginning too fa&s;t</HI> or <HI>too loud.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> HE did not make his <HI>Sentences</HI> or Periods too extended for the <HI>Writers</HI> to take them readily, or for the <HI>Hearers</HI> readily and ea&s;ily to have the &s;ence of them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="003188_0056_0FF013DC628C9EA8">
<HI>Tenthly,</HI> BEFORE he preach'd any Sermon he was de&s;irous in a <HI>devout Meditation</HI> to work every <HI>Head</HI> of it upon his <HI>Heart,</HI> until he turned it into a proper Supplication.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> HE would <HI>have</HI> and <HI>u&s;e</HI> Notes in Preaching; but yet would not &s;o read his <HI>Notes,</HI> as in the lea&s;t to take off the <HI>Vivacity</HI> of his <HI>Eye,</HI> his <HI>Voice,</HI> his whole <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Twelfthly,</HI> HE would have much of CHRIST in his <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> (CHRIST who is <HI>All!</HI>) As knowing that the Holy SPIRIT loves to glorify CHRIST; and if he did &s;o too, he &s;hould have much of the HOLY SPIRIT with him in his Mini&s;try.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenthly,</HI> AND he was re&s;olved to have great Care in his Mini&s;try, le&s;t at all he &s;hould confound <HI>the Methods of GRACE;</HI> upon a due <HI>Stating</HI> and <HI>Owning</HI> of which the Succe&s;s of the Mini&s;try does ex|ceedingly depend.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenthly,</HI> HE ordinarily would conclude his Sermons with &s;ome agreeable Text of Scripture, left with Life and Pungency to the Con&s;ideration of the Hearers; He tho't the Practice edifying.</P>
<P N="12">12. IN this Section I &s;hall produce &s;everal <HI>De&s;igns of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which he formed after his Inve&s;titure in the <HI>Sacred Calling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Apo&s;tle's Advice to a Young Mini&s;ter, <HI>Exerci&s;e thy &s;elf to Godline&s;s;</HI> he would think much upon it, read over &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es on the Subject, and as he went along, employ his particular Ejaculations upon every Article.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HAVING met with on Ob&s;ervation, That <HI>the want of Mortification in a Mini&s;ter, procures a &s;ad Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s to his Mini&s;try;</HI> and that he might not be a deplorable In&s;tance of it, he re&s;olved imme|diately to read over Dr. OWEN'S Treati&s;e <HI>of Mortifica|tion,</HI> (with others on the &s;ame Subject) and endea|vour to follow and apply the Direction in it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> HE took a Catalogue of all the <HI>Commu|nicants</HI> belonging to his Church; and in his <HI>Secret Prayers</HI> he re&s;olved that he would go over the <HI>Cata|logue</HI>

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> IN peru&s;ing his Sermons before he Preach|ed them, he re&s;olved to make even that an Exerci&s;e of Devotion by endeavouring to fetch an agreeable <HI>Ejaculation</HI> but of every <HI>Head</HI> and every <HI>Text</HI> pro|duced in them.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> HE had one De&s;ign which I will expre&s;s in his own Words;</P>
<P><Q>IT will co&s;t me very bitter Toyls and Pains; yet perhaps I may be &s;erviceable in it: If I procure to my &s;elf an exact Account of tho&s;e <HI>evil Humours,</HI> of which the place were I live at any time in under the ob&s;ervable Dominion; and whereas tho&s;e Devils may be ca&s;t out by <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> &s;et apart a Day &s;till of &s;ecret <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> for each of them; to <HI>deprecate</HI> my own Guiltine&s;s in them, and <HI>&s;upplicate</HI> for &s;uch Effu&s;ions of the SPIRIT from on high, as my redre&s;s, remove and bani&s;h &s;uch Di&s;tempers from the place.</Q></P>
<P N="13">13. BUT he did not think the&s;e Things &s;ufficient. He tho't it his Duty to <HI>vi&s;it the Families</HI> belonging to his Church; taking <HI>one,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>two After|noons</HI> in a Week for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HE &s;ent befire-hand to the <HI>Families,</HI> that he in|tended at &s;uch a time to <HI>vi&s;it</HI> them: And when he came, with as pungent and hand&s;ome Addre&s;&s;es, as po&s;&s;ible, he would treat every Per&s;on particularly about their Eternal Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> HE di&s;cour&s;ed with the <HI>Elder</HI> People upon &s;uch Points as he tho't mo&s;t proper for them.</P>
<P>AND e&s;pecially charged them to maintain <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> obtain'd their Promi&s;es for it if they had neglected it, and <HI>prayed with them</HI> that he might &s;how them <HI>how to pray,</HI> as well as to obtain their purpo&s;es for it.</P>
<P>HE likewi&s;e pre&s;&s;ed upon them the Care of in&s;truct|ing their <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> in the Holy Religion we profe&s;s, and bringing them up for CHRIST.</P>

IT any that he &s;hould have &s;poke with, were ab&s;ent, he frequently le&s;t a Solemn <HI>Text</HI> or two of the Sacred Scripture, which he tho't mo&s;t agreable for them; de|&s;iring &s;ome pre&s;ent would remember him to them, and from him recommend unto them that Oracle of GOD.</P>

<P>HE frequently got <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> from them relating to <HI>Secret Prayer, Reading the Scriptures</HI> &amp; Obedience to their <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>HE would often &s;et before them the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of the <HI>NewCovenant,</HI> after he had fir&s;t laboured for their Conviction and Awakening: So they have full of Tears expre&s;&s;ly declared their Con&s;enting to, and Ac|cepting of, the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of <HI>the Covenant of Grace,</HI> which he di&s;tinctly &s;et before them.</P>
<P>SOME of the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Folks' he would order to bring their <HI>Bibles</HI> to him, and read unto him from thence three or four Ver&s;es, to which he turned them: He would charm them to think on &s;uch Things, as he thence ob&s;erved for their Admonition, and never for|get tho&s;e <HI>faithful &s;ayings</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>HE would &s;ometimes leave &s;ome awful <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> with them, which, he told them, they &s;hould not A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;wer to him, but to <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> As, <HI>What have I been doi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g ever &s;ince I came into the World about the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Errand upon which GOD &s;ent me into the World?</HI> And <HI>If GOD &s;hould now call me out of the World, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t would become of me throughout Eternal Ages?</HI> And <HI>Have I ever yet by Faith carried a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng Soul unto the LORD JESUS for b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Salvation.</HI></P>

MANY other &s;uch Methods he took for the <HI>Win|ning of Souls</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Di&s;charge of his Mini&s;try: And he enjoy'd a mo&s;t wonderful Pre&s;ence of GOD with him in this undertaking; and &s;eldom left a <HI>Family</HI> without <HI>Tears</HI> dropt by &s;everal in it.</P>
<P>HE could &s;eldom di&s;patch more than four or five Families in an Afternoon, and look'd on this Work as <HI>laborious</HI> as any in all his Mini&s;try.

<P>AND in pur&s;uance of this Intention, (that is the Exerci&s;e of <HI>Love</HI>) he would ask him&s;elf before his <HI>Evening Prayers,</HI> Who hath in the foregoing Day &s;hown me any <HI>Kindne&s;s?</HI> And he would then par|ticularly &s;upplicate the GOD of Heaven that he would be&s;tow <HI>Spiritual and Eternal Favours</HI> on each of them that had particularly obliged him.</P>

<P>I find my &s;elf obliged to mention one or two Affairs, particularly in which Mr. MATHER was con|&s;idered and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MY Country is very &s;en&s;ible that in the Year 1688. (when one of the mo&s;t wicked of Kings was on the
<PB N="42" REF="003188_0064_0FF013F178212BD0">Briti&s;h Throne) ANDROS and his Crew were very violent, illegal and arbitary in their Proceedings: I need not give any Narrative of their Managements here, becau&s;e there has been an Account of them al|ready given to the World.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e <HI>Roaring Lions</HI> and <HI>Ranging Bears</HI> were in the mid&s;t of their Ravages; It was in the Month of <HI>April</HI> when we had News by the Edges concerning a De&s;cent made upon <HI>England</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for the Re&s;cue of the Nations from <HI>Slavery</HI> and <HI>Popery;</HI> &mdash; Then a Strange Di&s;po&s;ition entred in the Body of our People to a&s;&s;ert our <HI>Liberties</HI> again&s;t the Arbitrary Rulers that were fleecing them: But it was much feared by the more &s;en&s;ible Gentlemen at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that an unruly Company of Soldiers, who had newly de&s;erted the Service in which they had bin employed for the Ea&s;tern War, by the gathering of their Friends to them to protect them from the Go|vernor, who, they tho't, intended nothing but Ruine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them, would make a great Stir &amp; produce a <HI>bloody Revol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</HI></P>
<P>AND therefore the principal Gentlemen in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with Mr. MATHER to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done; and they all agreed, if po&s;&s;ible, that they would extingui&s;h all E&s;&s;ays in our People to an <HI>In|&s;urrection;</HI> but that if the Country People to the Northward by any violent Motions pu&s;h'd on the Matter &s;o far as to make a <HI>Revolution</HI> unavoidable, <HI>Then</HI> to prevent the Shedding of <HI>Blood</HI> by an ungo|verned Multitude, &s;ome of the Gentlemen pre&s;ent would appear in the Head of what Action &s;hould be done; and a <HI>Declaration</HI> was prepared accordingly.</P>
<P>ON <HI>April</HI> 18. the People were &s;o driving &amp; furious, that unheaded they began to &s;eize our public Op|pre&s;&s;ors: upon which the Gentlemen afore&s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it nece&s;&s;ary to appear, that by their Authority among the People the unhappy Tumults might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a little regulated. And thro' the Goodne&s;s of GOD, altho'
<PB N="43" REF="003188_0065_0FF013F4B38BA208">the whole Country were now in a mo&s;t prodigious Ferment and Thou&s;ands of exa&s;perated People in Arms were come into <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> yet there was no manner of Outrage committed; only the <HI>public Robbers</HI> that had lorded it over Us were confined. 'Twas then Mr. MATHER appeared &mdash; He was the In&s;trument of preventing the Exce&s;&s;es into which <HI>the Wrath of Man</HI> is too ready to run; He came and like a NESTOR or ULISSES rea&s;oned down the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Populace: had he li&s;ped a Syllable for it, perhaps the People would by a &s;udden <HI>Council of War</HI> have try'd, judg'd and hang'd tho&s;e ill Men, who would have treated him otherwi&s;e. Neverthele&s;s he &s;et him&s;elf both <HI>pub|lickly</HI> &amp; <HI>privately</HI> to hinder the Peoples proceeding any further than to re&s;erve the Criminals for the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>NOW the Per&s;ecution which was intended for Mr. MATHER was diverted; for on that very Day that he was to be committed to <HI>half a Years Impri&s;onment,</HI> tho&s;e that would have <HI>wrong'd</HI> him were <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> taken into Cu&s;tody: And yet &s;o generous was he as not only to expo&s;e his <HI>Name</HI> but even his <HI>Life</HI> unto the Rage of the Multitude for the &s;aving of &s;ome that would have hurt him: Tho' he had no Thanks for his Ingenuity.</P>
<P>THE Spirit which acted him in the&s;e Matters is expre&s;&s;ed in a Sermon he preach'd to the Convention of the Colony from 2 Chron. XV. 2. It was printed under the Title of, <HI>The Way to Pro&s;perity.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days before this, the Inhabitants of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> a&s;&s;embling together to chu&s;e <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> for that <HI>Convention</HI> &amp; vote <HI>In&s;tructions</HI> for them, it was appre|hended, that the different Per&s;ua&s;ions of the People a|bout the <HI>next Steps</HI> to be taken for our Settlement would have produced a Fury near to <HI>Blood&s;hed;</HI> and therefore Mr. MATHER was de&s;ired to be at their Meeting. The Meeting began with dangerous and horrible Paroxy&s;ms, which when he &s;aw, he upon it made an affectionate and moving Speech to them, at which many fell into

<P>UPON, Di&s;cour&s;ing with him of the&s;e Affairs he has told me, that he always pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> unto a legal Government, tho' he &s;uffered from &s;ome tumultuous People, by doing &s;o; and upon the whole, has a&s;&s;erted unto me his <HI>Innocency</HI> and Freedom from all <HI>known Iniquity</HI> in that Time, but declared his Re&s;olution, from the View he had of the fickle Humors of the Populace that he would chu&s;e to be concern'd with them as little as po&s;&s;ible for the future.

<P N="3">3. MY Country is al&s;o acquainted with the Confu|&s;ions which they &s;uffered by the <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> in it. I &s;hall here &s;ay a little of <HI>that</HI> Time of Temptation; and write Mr. MATHER'S Sentiments, &amp; Actions.</P>
<P>THE Summer of the Year 1692. was a very dole|ful Time unto the whole Country. &mdash; The Devils after a mo&s;t pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ternatural Manner by the dreadful Judgments of Heaven took a <HI>Bodily Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of many People in our <HI>Salem,</HI> and Places adjacent; where the Hou&s;es of the poor People began to be filled with the Cries of Per&s;ons tormented by <HI>Evil Spirits.</HI> There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em'd to be an execrable <HI>Witchcraft</HI> in the Founda|tion of this Wondrous Affliction; many Per&s;ons of diver&s;e Characters being accu&s;ed, apprehended, pro|&s;ecuted upon the <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI> of the Afflicted.</P>
<P>Mr. MATHER, for his Part, was always affraid of proceding to convict and condemn any. Per&s;on as a <HI>Confederate</HI> with afflicting <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mons</HI> upon &s;o feeble an Evidence as a <HI>Spectral Repre&s;entation.</HI> Accordingly he ever te&s;tified again&s;t it both <HI>publickly</HI> &amp; <HI>privately,</HI> and particularly, in his <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>Judges,</HI> he be|&s;ought them that they would by no means admit it; and when a con&s;iderable <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Mini&s;ters</HI> gave
<PB N="45" REF="003188_0067_0FF013F94E6038B8">in their <HI>Advice</HI> about that Matter, he not only con|cur'd with the Advice but He drew it up.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, on the other &s;ide, he &s;aw in mo&s;t of the <HI>Judges</HI> a charming In&s;tance of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Patience;</HI> and as he knew their exemplary <HI>Piety,</HI> &s;o he ob&s;erved the <HI>Agony</HI> of Soul with which they &s;ought the Direction of Heaven, above mo&s;t other of our People who were enchanted into a raging, railing and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;onable Di&s;po&s;ition. For this Cau&s;e, tho' Mr. MATHER could not allow the <HI>Principles</HI> &s;ome of the Judges had e&s;pou&s;ed; he could not however but &s;peak honourably of their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> on all Occa&s;ions; and his <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> upon the &s;ight of their <HI>Difficulties,</HI> which <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> was rai&s;ed by his Journeys to <HI>Salem</HI> the chief Seat of the&s;e Diabolical Vexations, cau&s;ed him &s;till to go to the Place. And merely for this Rea&s;on, &s;ome mad People in the Country (from whom one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two credulous Foreigners have dared to publi&s;hed the abu&s;ive Story) under a <HI>Fa&s;cination</HI> of their <HI>Spirits</HI> equal to what our <HI>Evergumens</HI> had upon their <HI>Bodies,</HI> reviled Mr. MATHER, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if he had bin the Doer of the hard Things that were done in the Pro&s;ecution of the <HI>Witchcraft.</HI></P>
<P>IN this <HI>evil Time</HI> Mr. MATHER offered at the Be|ginning that if the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed People</HI> might be &s;cattered far a&s;under, he would &s;ingly provide for <HI>Six</HI> of them; and he with &s;ome others would &s;ee whether without more bitter Methods, <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> would not put an end unto the&s;e heavy Trials: But his Offer was not accepted.</P>
<P>HOWEVER for a great Part of the Summer he did almo&s;t every <HI>Week</HI> &s;pend a Day by Him&s;elf in the Ex|erci&s;es of a &s;ecret FAST before the LORD. On the&s;e Days He cried unto GOD not only for his own Pre|&s;ervation from the Malice and Power of <HI>the Evil An|gels,</HI> but al&s;o for a <HI>good I&s;&s;ue</HI> of the Calamities in which he had permitted the <HI>Evil Angels</HI> to en&s;nare the mi&s;erable Country. He al&s;o be&s;ought the LORD
<PB N="46" REF="003188_0068_0FF013FBB2AED2B0">that he would enable him, pro&s;per, direct and accept him in publi&s;hing &s;uch Te&s;timonies for HIM as were proper, and would be &s;erviceable unto HIS Intere&s;ts on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND that a right U&s;e might be made of the pro|digious Things which had been happening among us, he now compo&s;ed &amp; publi&s;hed his Book entituled, <HI>The Wonders of the invi&s;ible World;</HI> which was re|printed &s;everal Times in <HI>London:</HI> In the Preface he &s;peaks of, <HI>"the heart-breaking Excerci&s;es."</HI> He went thro' in writing it.&mdash; There was a certain <HI>Di&s;|believer of Witchcraft</HI> who wrote again&s;t <HI>this</HI> Book; but as the <HI>Man</HI> is dead, his Book died long before him.</P>
<P>BUT having &s;poken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">no' of the more <HI>publick Witch|craft;</HI> I think I will hale in here an Account of a <HI>Witchcraft</HI> happening in <HI>one private</HI> Family at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> two or three Years before the <HI>general</HI> one.</P>
<P>'TWAS, I think, in the Year 1689. in the Winter, that &s;everal Children belonging to a pious Family at the South End of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> were horribly <HI>bewitch'd and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</HI></P>

<P>HE was one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, whom he very much excited and &s;pirited to the Doing of what has bin done here.

<P><HI>WHAT &s;hall I do as a</HI> Pa&s;tor <HI>of a Church for the Good of the Flock under my Charge?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he rank'd the People of the Flock into &s;everal <HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI> di&s;tinctly con&s;idering, what they were, and what was to be done for them.

He con&s;idered how to make his <HI>pub|lick Mini&s;try</HI> more lively; u&s;eful and acceptable.

<P>HE obliged him&s;elf unto this Method in Studying a <HI>Sermon;</HI> on every <HI>Paragraph</HI> he made a <HI>Pau&s;e,</HI> and endeavoured with <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> and <HI>Ejacu|lations</HI> to Heaven, and with <HI>Self-Examinations</HI> to feel &s;ome holy Impre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Truths</HI> in that Para|graph on his own Soul before he went any further.

<P><PB N="52" REF="003188_0074_0FF0140CB2EF3EE0">
HIS <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> for MONDAY Morning was, <HI>What &s;hall I do in my</HI> Family, <HI>and for the Good of it?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he con&s;idered him&s;elf as an <HI>Husband,</HI> as a <HI>Father</HI> and as a <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> He would de&s;ire his <HI>Con&s;ort</HI> to think, what <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> there were that She would make to him in her Service.

<P>HE con&s;idered what <HI>Points of Education</HI> were &s;till wanting in any of his <HI>Children,</HI> and pur&s;ued them in the mo&s;t proper Ways. I told you before, he cau&s;ed them to <HI>read</HI> and <HI>write</HI> &s;uch things as he found out for their be&s;t Advantage, and mo&s;t &s;uitable Entertain|ment. He took each of them alone &s;ucce&s;&s;ively on the <HI>Saturday Evenings,</HI> and, having obtained a know|ledge of their interior State, and the declared Re&s;olu|tions of their Souls for early Piety, he prayed with them. He cau&s;ed &s;ome of them to compo&s;e <HI>Prayers</HI> and bring them to him in writing, that he might &s;ee their Temper and Progre&s;s in Religion. He obliged them to retire and ponder upon that Que&s;tion, <HI>What &s;hould I wi&s;h to have done, if I were now a dying?</HI> And he would oblige them to report unto him their own An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion, of which he took Ad|vantage to inculcate <HI>the Le&s;&s;ons of Godline&s;s</HI> on them.</P>
<P>HE con&s;idered how to drop u&s;eful Admonitions on his <HI>Servants,</HI> as they were waiting on him; if the Action afforded any Time for it.

And as a &s;ort of <HI>Crumbs</HI> falling from the Table of his <HI>Servants,</HI> he hired a Woman to keep <HI>a School,</HI> in which the Sable <HI>Sons of Ethiopia</HI> might every Evening learn to <HI>read</HI> and be taught their <HI>Ca|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hi&s;m;</HI> and he him&s;elf bore the whole Expence of

<P>TWO were his <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> for TUESDAY Morning.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>WHAT &s;hall I do for my</HI> Relatives <HI>abroad?</HI> He took a <HI>Catalogue,</HI> which began with his <HI>Parents,</HI> and extended as far as the <HI>Children</HI> of his <HI>Cou&s;in Ger|mans.</HI> With the help of this <HI>Catalogue,</HI> he propoun|ded that he would at proper times <HI>pray</HI> for each of them di&s;tinctly by Name. And that every Week he would &s;ingle out one of them to con&s;ider, <HI>What Good may I do for them? Or in what In&s;tance may they be the better for me?</HI> And, that he might addre&s;s every one of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with faithful Admoniti|ons, concerning their interior and eternal Intere&s;ts, either by &s;peaking to them per&s;onally, or by Writing to them, or by putting <HI>Books of Piety</HI> into their Hands; he propounded in this way to glorify our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, and endeavour a Conformity to him, who even on his <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> took peculiar Care of one that was <HI>nearly related</HI> unto him. But he did not confine the&s;e E&s;&s;ays of Good unto his <HI>Relatives</HI> with|in the Limits of his Catalogue: No! Heh made them reach as far as ever he could find out Opportunities. I need not any further explain this Article; only in one In&s;tance.</P>
<P>WHEN his Father was become aged and in a con|tinual and de&s;irous Expectation of his call out of this World, tho' he was in a good State of Health, Strength and Vigor; he re&s;olved that every Interview he had with him (which was almo&s;t every Day) &s;hould have in it &s;omething or other referring to the <HI>Heaven|ly World,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t their mutual Preparation for it&punc; not knowing but <HI>it might be the la&s;t Time</HI> of their Conferring together in this.</P>
<P>BUT then Secondly; When &s;uch an Occa&s;ion for it has occur'd, he intermitted the former Que&s;tion, and was as much concerned for <HI>his Enemies</HI> (whom GOD
<PB N="54" REF="003188_0076_0FF0141262EE17C8">made In&s;truments of Good unto him) <HI>as for his Re|latives.</HI> He therefore enquired, <HI>What Good &s;hall I do for my Per&s;onal</HI> Enemies; <HI>and how &s;hall I over|come Evil with Good?</HI></P>
<P>HIS publick Circum&s;tances, he <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> in the Di&s;charge of his Duty, the Power of <HI>Satan</HI> over the Minds of many People &amp; the <HI>Envy</HI> of &s;ome ill Spirits at his Improvement and Acceptance procured him a Number of <HI>per&s;onal Enemies,</HI> or at lea&s;t of &s;uch as treated him <HI>injuriou&s;ly</HI> and <HI>abu&s;ively.</HI> Each of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, as far as he could come to the Knowledge of them, he would &s;et him&s;elf di&s;tinctly to con&s;ider, <HI>What good Offices he might do for them?</HI> Be&s;ure, ac|cordingly, he <HI>pray'd</HI> for each of them by Name, and he would &s;ay, as I remember I have read in Mr. BUR|KIT'S Life, <HI>&s;ome Per&s;ons had never had a &s;hare in my Prayers but for the</HI> Injuries <HI>they have done me</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4.</NOTE>. And if he could perceive or invent any other Oppor|tunity <HI>to do them Good,</HI> he wou'd do it; tho' many Times he has done it &s;o, that they knew not whence it came. He was very fond of being able to &s;ay, <HI>That he knew not of any Per&s;on in the World, that had done</HI> him <HI>an ill Office, but</HI> he <HI>had done him a good one for it;</HI> and he left off the Alternation of this Que&s;tion, till there might recur Opportunities for his Tho'ts upon it.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> for WEDNESDAY Morning was, <HI>What &s;hall I do for the</HI> Churches <HI>of the LORD, and the more general Intere&s;t of Religion in the World?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he con&s;idered, what <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> to make un|to other <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of his Acquaintance. He con&s;idered what <HI>Books</HI> he might compo&s;e &amp; publi&s;h to advance the Kingdom of his SAVIOUR. He con&s;idered, how to diffu&s;e and di&s;per&s;e the <HI>Engines</HI> of Chri&s;tian Know|ledge and Vertue unto di&s;tant Places.

<P>BUT I come to THURSDAY Morning: His <HI>Que&s;|tion</HI> for that was, <HI>What Good may I do in the &s;everal</HI> Societies <HI>to which I am related?</HI></P>
<P>HE was related to above <HI>twenty</HI> Societies of a <HI>Re|ligious</HI> Character and Intention.

<P>SOME of the <HI>Societies</HI> which he cheri&s;hed as well as produced, were a &s;ort of <HI>Reforming Societies,</HI> or <HI>So|cieties for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Di&s;orders.</HI> I have &s;poke of them before, but will now give a more particular Account of them.

<P>THUS I have taken the Liberty to recite their <HI>Points of Con&s;ideration,</HI> in hopes that the publi&s;hing of them may be very &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>THE Doctor &s;tarted numberle&s;s Things in the <HI>Societies</HI> upon the&s;e Points. Their <HI>Regi&s;ters</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e, are fill'd with them. I &s;hall only add, con|cerning the&s;e <HI>Societies,</HI> that once a Year <HI>they</HI> u&s;ed all to meet together in one Place, and have a <HI>Day of Prayer,</HI> in which they humbled them&s;elves for doing &s;o little Good; and be&s;ought the Pardon of their Un|fruitfulne&s;s thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice; and implored the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven on the E&s;&s;ays to do Good which they had made, with the Coun&s;el and Conduct of Heaven for their further E&s;&s;ays, and &s;uch Influences of Heaven as might bring about tho&s;e <HI>Reformations,</HI> which it was not in their Power to ac|compli&s;h. On the&s;e Days the Doctor, with another Mini&s;ter carried on the Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>THIS was his Method on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Mornings: But at length he found it expedient to change his Que&s;tion; and He made this his alternate one; <HI>Is there any particular Per&s;on able to do the Good, which lies out of my more immediate Reach, to whom I may offer &s;ome good Propo&s;al?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="003188_0080_0FF0141CA34530A8">
BY an&s;wering this Que&s;tion, he made his Conver|&s;ation &s;till more u&s;eful. Thus he was often a Doer of Good <HI>at the Second Hand,</HI> and often had the Plea&s;ure not to be known to have any hand at all in what was done.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion for FRIDAY Morn was con&s;tantly this; <HI>What &s;pecial Subjects of Affliction, and Objects of Compa&s;&s;ion, may I take under my particular Care; and what &s;hall I do for them?</HI></P>
<P>HERE he took a Catalogue of the <HI>Poor</HI> in his numerous Flock; but extended his Care further than &s;o, wherever he &s;aw any mi&s;erable. He minded al&s;o, who wanted <HI>Employment;</HI> He took notice of tho&s;e under <HI>peculiar Exerci&s;es;</HI> and was very tho'tful, what Souls were by particular Addre&s;&s;es, to be <HI>pull'd as Brands out of the Burning,</HI> becau&s;e of their being abandoned to flaming Wickedne&s;s? He con&s;tantly fingled out one or other of the&s;e to be on this Morn|ing con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add one thing more upon this Head: He con&s;idered, that tho' the <HI>Wind</HI> will not fill the <HI>Hungry,</HI> yet it will turn the <HI>Mill,</HI> that will grind the <HI>Corn</HI> to fill the <HI>hungry.</HI> And therefore, having his <HI>Li&s;t of Mi&s;erables</HI> commonly with him, he very often in Company would make it a Subject of the Conver&s;ation, <HI>What &s;hall be done for &s;uch or &s;uch an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne in my Li&s;t?</HI> And thus, be&s;ides the innumerable Kindne&s;&s;es which he had him&s;elf more immediately done for them, he procured multitudes of Kindne&s;&s;es from others; and the fir&s;t Spring in the Motion has been unknown to them. Very much of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of his Life was in &s;uch things as the&s;e. And I may tell my Reader, what I gave him to under&s;tand before, that he did <HI>not</HI> ordinarily let <HI>one Day in a Year</HI> pa&s;s him, without &s;omething expended on <HI>pious U&s;es,</HI> be&s;ides his other continual <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es</HI> to afflic|ted People.</P>

AND at length I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trive to <HI>his Que&s;tion</HI> for SATUR|DAY Morning. I may well call it <HI>his,</HI> for it was about the Concerns of <HI>his own Soul.</HI></P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion was; <HI>What more have I to do for the Intere&s;t of GOD in my own Heart and Life?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall a little here illu&s;trate his way of Thinking upon this Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>HE would &s;et him&s;elf to con&s;ider the more <HI>&s;pecial Sins of his Youth;</HI> and what more <HI>&s;pecial Service</HI> he &s;hould do for the Kingdom of GOD, in the greate&s;t Contrariety to his <HI>former Mi&s;carriages.</HI></P>
<P>HE &s;et him&s;elf then to con&s;ider the <HI>Reproaches</HI> he had met with; and upon this, what <HI>Services</HI> he &s;hould be awakened by them to do for the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>HE con&s;idered, how he was favoured with &s;urpri|zing and uncommon Opportunities to publi&s;h many <HI>Books of Piety;</HI> and of what va&s;t Concernment it was, that he &s;hould take effectual Care <HI>his own Books</HI> did not prove at la&s;t his Condemnation, by his failing in tho&s;e <HI>Attainments in Religion,</HI> which he commen|ded unto others.

<P>HE re&s;olved, that whatever <HI>bodily Infirmities</HI> he might labour under, (or that he could call to mind he had been vi&s;ited with) he would make them the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Incentives</HI> of &s;ome agreable Di&s;po&s;itions in his Soul.</P>

<P N="1">1. AMONG the <HI>three Things</HI> which con&s;titute a <HI>fini&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d Divine, Temptation</HI> is one; and none mu&s;t expect to be rery con&s;iderable with|out them. Mr. MATHER had his &s;hare of them.</P>
<P>HE was never much tempted to que&s;tion the <HI>Ex|i&s;tence</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of the DEITY: If ever he was at all, he <HI>rejected</HI> the tho'ts with the utmo&s;t Dete&s;ta|tion and Abhorrence.</P>
<P>WHENEVER he was tempted to any evil <HI>Frame</HI> of Soul, or any wrong <HI>Action,</HI> his con&s;tant Cour&s;e was to cry out, <HI>O LORD I be&s;eech THEE, Deliver my Soul!</HI> and he endeavoured to form &s;uch <HI>Tho'ts</HI> as &s;hould be <HI>rever&s;e,</HI> to tho&s;e infu&s;ed or excited by the Tempter, as well as to <HI>act contrary</HI> and diametrically oppo&s;ite to what he was tempted to. Thus he <HI>re&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the Devil</HI> until <HI>he fled from</HI> him: He tho't, that Oracle in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 58. was An&s;wer enough for any Temptation.</P>
<P N="2">2. I will relate one or two In&s;tances of the Divine Appearance to keep him from De&s;truction, when in very great Danger.</P>
<P>IN his 36th Year he received a Remarkable <HI>De|liverance.</HI> For, Riding over a <HI>Bridge</HI> one of the <HI>Poles</HI> on it, that was <HI>rotten,</HI> broke, and his Hor&s;e broke thro' and <HI>&s;unk down to his Brea&s;t.</HI> Mr. MA|THER cho&s;e rather to keep the Saddle than go off into the <HI>River,</HI> and the Hor&s;e to the A&s;toni&s;hment of the Company <HI>ro&s;e</HI> again (tearing off his <HI>Shoe</HI> in Ri&s;ing) and leap'd over with Mr. MATHER &s;afe upon him.
<PB N="61" REF="003188_0083_0FF01424C4A529C8">How happily do all Creatures &s;erve us, while we are &s;erving their and our LORD!</P>
<P>I &s;hall relate but one notable Deliverance more: When the Squadron arrived from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> on Board of which there was a con&s;iderable Army return|ed from a fruitle&s;s Expedition there; Mr. MATHER was de&s;ired by many of the Officers to give them a Sermon on a certain <HI>Sabbath</HI> upon an <HI>I&s;land</HI> where they put a&s;hore to air them&s;elves. He ra&s;hly under|took it, but while he was in his Excellency's Barge, he was taken &s;o very Sick that his Friends mu&s;t needs carry him back again. As &s;oon as he came Home he was well: The Admiral afterwards told him, it was well he went no further; for the Army had newly &s;uffered a great De&s;olation by a Sickne&s;s more infecti|ous and de&s;tructive than the Plague it &s;elf: And had he gone and conver&s;ed among &s;uch an infectious Com|pany, it would probably have co&s;t him his Life, as it proved mortal to many of his Neighbours, who were &s;o hardy as to go down among them.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT having mentioed his being kept from ill|ne&s;s, I may now very properly add a Section of his be|ing <HI>vi&s;ited with Sickne&s;s,</HI> his <HI>Thot's</HI> under it, his <HI>De|liverance</HI> from it, with the grateful Sentiments of his Heart upon being kept from &s;undry Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, e&s;pecially when a Young Man, he was troubled with tormenting Pains in his <HI>Teeth</HI> and <HI>Jaws;</HI> which <HI>Pains</HI> made him lo&s;e more Time than he was willing to &s;pare, and which produced many a &s;ad Hour to him in his Pilgrimage. In the&s;e Pains he would &s;et him&s;elf, as well as he could, to <HI>try his Ways.</HI></P>
<P>HE con&s;idered whether or no, he had not &s;inned with his <HI>Teeth?</HI> How? By &s;inful and exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Eat|ing:</HI> And by <HI>Evil Speeches;</HI> for there are <HI>Literae Dentales</HI> u&s;ed in them. At la&s;t by a cour&s;e of Wa&s;h|ing behind his Ears and on the Top of his Head with <HI>Cold Water,</HI> he obtainted a Deliverance from the un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003188_0084_0FF014266F1E5CD8">
BY Rea&s;on of his Sedentary Life, great Study and little Exerci&s;e, he was when in Years much afflicted and enfeebled with Sickne&s;s at his <HI>Stomach,</HI> a palled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d pained Stomach. From hence he mu&s;t awaken him&s;elf to bewail his want of a Stomach for the Service of GOD, and Meditations on his SAVIOUR; he mu&s;t mourn for his not having an Appetite for the be&s;t Ob|jects and Actions; which he tho't he had not duely reli&s;hed: The Offences of his Stomach in the Intemp|erance of the Table he tho't al&s;o to be bewailed; he mu&s;t beg the Pardon of his Mi&s;carriages thro' the Blood of the great Sacrifice, and beg Grace to carry it better. Thus he fetch'd <HI>Good out of Evil;</HI> and thus Evil <HI>work'd together for</HI> his <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t Thing I &s;hall mention in this Section is his pious Tho'ts upon being delivered from Sickne&s;s <HI>in General,</HI> and <HI>five Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>HE was ever de&s;irous, to be greatly affected with Di&s;po&s;itions of agreable Gratitude unto the GOD of his Health; and by the Health with which he was fa|voured to be awakened unto &s;uch Acknowledgments of GOD and &s;uch Re&s;olutions of Piety, as he tho't were mo&s;t emphatically expected from him. Wherefore when he vi&s;ited the Sick, he would ble&s;s the LORD for his own <HI>Freedom</HI> from their Di&s;ea&s;es; and would think, what <HI>moral Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and Di&s;orders he had analogous to them, again&s;t which he &s;hould be watch|ful; and unto what Graces and Actions he &s;hould by the Goodne&s;s of his SAVIOUR be animated, and he would fir&s;t offer his <HI>Prayers</HI> and them employ his <HI>Cares</HI> for the obtaining of them.</P>
<P>THERE are particularly <HI>five Di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> his Deliver|ance from each of which, he improved in a way of exceeding <HI>Thankfulne&s;s</HI> unto the LORD his <HI>Healer.</HI> And being delivered from <HI>them,</HI> he would on the oc|ca&s;ion glorify his GOD after this manner. Since he was not lying under the living Death of a <HI>Pal&s;ey,</HI> he would be very zealous and <HI>active</HI> in the Service of
<PB N="63" REF="003188_0085_0FF014282B169BF0">GOD. Since he was not under Corro&s;ions of a <HI>Cancer,</HI> he would have all Tendencies to <HI>Envy</HI> extingui&s;hed in his Soul, and a perpetual Joy at the Pro&s;perity of his Neighbour flouri&s;hing in him. Since he had not the Tortures of the <HI>Gout,</HI> his <HI>Feet</HI> &s;hould chearfully carry him to the afflicted, with Comfortable Words, and unto the Congregation of the Faithful; While his <HI>Hands</HI> &s;hould not be idle in writing for GOD, and in di&s;tributing to the Poor.

And &s;ince he was not wa&s;ting with a <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI> he would beware of <HI>Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ne&s;s</HI> in the Soul, and <HI>pining away</HI> in Iniquity. Thus he <HI>learned Obedience by the things which he &s;uffered</HI> not.</P>
<P N="4">4. I never ob&s;erved among Pagan Writers a better de&s;cription in &s;o few Words of a good Man, re&s;olute in <HI>Virtue,</HI> even while he is <HI>reproached</HI> for it, than that of RUTILIUS, <HI>RUTILII Virtus &amp; Innocen|tia lateret, ni&s;i accepi&s;&s;et Injuriam; Dum viciatur efful&s;it</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seneca Epi&s;t. 79.</NOTE>. The very &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning Dr. MATHER, in the mid&s;t of the <HI>ba&s;e U&s;age</HI> he met with from the <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Pens</HI> of &s;everal.</P>
<P>MY excellent Uncle of <HI>Witney</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> in his <HI>Letter about Temptations,</HI> ob&s;erves, that Mini&s;ters, who meet with abu&s;es from &s;orry and &s;coundrel Peo|ple, have cau&s;e to look on them&s;elves as humbled on the Account of their having the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Plague of <HI>Lice</HI> upon them. If &s;o, then the Doctor might have Cau&s;e for Humiliation on the &s;ame Account; having perhaps the Iin&s;ults of contemptible People, the A&s;&s;aults of tho&s;e in&s;ignificant <HI>Lice,</HI> more than any Man in <HI>New-England.</HI> The&s;e trouble&s;ome but diminutive Creatures he &s;corn'd to concern him&s;elf with, only to <HI>pity</HI> them and <HI>pray</HI> for them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER GOD appeared &s;o for him, that &s;everal of them have at la&s;t been bro't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o confe&s;s, again&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="003188_0086_0FF0142B38146A30">their Will almo&s;t, what &s;uperior Excellency there was in him.</P>
<P>I will here for &s;ome Cau&s;es in&s;ert one Pa&s;&s;age; (tho' there were &s;everal in the Doctor's Life of the &s;ame Importance) 'Tis this;</P>
<P>IN the Year 1704. <HI>Octob.</HI> 10. there came &s;everal People to the Doctor very late at Night, telling him, there was a Man in the Town lay a dying, but cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not be &s;atisfied unle&s;s he &s;aw <HI>him</HI> before he died. The Man was noted for his wickedne&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Name was <HI>Goerge Fielding.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the Doctor came to him (who wondred at him that he would &s;o readily do it) he told him to this Purpo&s;e <Q>That he had been a very profane Per|&s;on; that he had given him&s;elf a great Liberty to abu&s;e good Men; but had abu&s;ed no Man in the World &s;o much as Doctor MATHER, and that he could not go out of the World without confe&s;&s;ing it, bewailing it unto him, and be&s;eeching him to pardon it.</Q> The Doctor asked him, if he had re|ceived any particular Prejudice, or ever had been in|formed or could have pretended any particular Matter of Fact, upon which his Abu&s;es might have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed? He gave him to under&s;tand, that <Q>There was nothing of <HI>that,</HI> but all was downright <HI>Malig|nity;</HI> for he took him to be a Man that did <HI>more Good than</HI> others, and that was <HI>all the Rea&s;on</HI> why he had vilified him more than other Men.</Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor, after his well known mild Way, told the Man, That there was no Occa&s;ion for any Par|don becau&s;e of his Speaking <HI>diminutively</HI> of him; for, &s;ays he, you may &s;peak &s;o of me, and do me no wrong. But, continued he, for your &s;peaking injuri|ou&s;ly, fal&s;ely, calumniou&s;ly of me, it was indeed a Fault; yet, as he would forgive it without his asking for it, had it been ten hundred times more than it was, he would join with him in crying to GOD for the Forgivene&s;s of that, and every Thing el&s;e where|in
<PB N="65" REF="003188_0087_0FF0142E58CBABE8">he had done ami&s;s.' He did &s;o. The Man was full of Affection to him, kept continually crying for him to be with him the next Day in the Forenoon, and he died in the Afternoon.&mdash; And perhaps every Man who ever reproached him, if he were to place him&s;elf in the Circum&s;tances of a <HI>dying Man</HI> would alter his Opinion and change his Tone.</P>
<P><HI>I have &s;aid</HI> of his <HI>meaner</HI> Reproaches: But, could one think it, the Doctor's di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> procured him &s;ome Enemies among tho&s;e who might <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> pa&s;s for <HI>Men of Sen&s;e &amp; Credit.</HI> Such would &s;ometimes &s;peak <HI>di&s;re&s;pectfully</HI> of him; and now and then a ZOI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">S would vent his Spite, <HI>foam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous his</HI> Malice and Shame; while he in&s;tead of returning an An&s;wer when advis'd to it, cho&s;e rather to publi&s;h &s;uch Treati&s;es as were la&s;ting Te&s;timonies of his <HI>Religion &amp; Charity.</HI></P>

<P>SOMETIMES they would endite <HI>Letters</HI> full of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|veling Malice, and &s;end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem unto him: He received them without Emotion of Soul, and tied them up till they made a large Bundle, on the out &s;ide of which he wrote, <HI>Libels?

<P>THE <HI>Number</HI> of the Books, which he prin|ted, is <HI>three hundred eighty and two;</HI> and and yet, as one of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets &s;ays of <HI>him that acts with GOD on his &s;ide,</HI> he wrote them, as he <HI>did all Things with Ea&s;e.</HI>&mdash; On the out&s;ide of the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of his Works, which I &s;hall give you at the End of this Book, he wrote that Text for his further Excitation and Encouragement, Joh. xv. 8. <HI>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much Fruit:</HI> And upon looking over the <HI>Catalog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> I

<P N="2">2. BEFORE I &s;peak of <HI>one</HI> particular Book, I &s;hall make a <HI>general Ob&s;ervation</HI> concerning the Doctor's Writings. To prepare the way to the Remark, let me tell you, That Dr. MATHER'S <HI>quick Di&s;patch</HI> in <HI>Reading</HI> was well known to all; he would <HI>ride Po&s;t</HI> thro' an Author, <HI>Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: pedum praevertere Ventos;</HI> and yet, which was more &s;urprizing, he always <HI>remem|bred the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable</HI> Things he read, was <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of them and able to <HI>produce</HI> them.</P>
<P>MY general Remark therefore concerning mo&s;t of the Doctor's Writings except his <HI>practical</HI> ones, is, That we need not wonder to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd in his Books &s;o <HI>many learned Allu&s;ions</HI> and <HI>References;</HI> for it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that a Man &s;hould keep from <HI>writing learnedly,</HI> and as if he were acquainted with Author's and their Sentiments, when his Mind is &s;tored with their <HI>various Ideas</HI> and Images, and he is a compleat <HI>Owner</HI> of them.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed a Set of <HI>Witlings,</HI> who for Fear of <HI>Pedantry,</HI> and hurting a Period, would not quote a <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence, however weighty and pregnant it may be; but, in&s;tead of the <HI>ma&s;&s;y Sen&s;e</HI> in the Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>others,</HI> chu&s;e <HI>their own ea&s;y Flow of Words, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding Vacuity of Tho't.</HI> Thus the&s;e Men <HI>Dum vitant vitia in contraria cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at.</HI> Sat. 2.</NOTE>, to u&s;e a Sentence of HORACE'S; and, to mortify them with another Author, JUVENAL gives their Charac|ter when he &s;ays of &s;ome; <HI>Rarus Sermo illis et mag|na Libido ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ndi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Juvenal.</HI> Sat.</NOTE>; which la&s;t Sentence I would tran&s;late, they have <HI>a great Gu&s;t for &s;aying nothing.</HI></P>

<P>I need not &s;ay any more in a general way concern|ing Dr. MATHER'S <HI>Writings;</HI> &s;ince in the 44th and 45th Pages of his <HI>Manuductio</HI> he has hindred me, by giving the World a De&s;cription and Account of them,</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t Book, I &s;hall treat of, &s;hall be his <HI>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana:</HI> A <HI>Book</HI> replete with <HI>Learning,</HI> and excellently calculated for the Ad|vancement of true <HI>Religion &amp; Undefiled:</HI> A <HI>Book,</HI> in which the good Names of above <HI>four&s;core Wor|thies,</HI> who for the Cau&s;e of CHRIST came over into this Land when it was a Wilderne&s;s, are con&s;ign'd over with Honor, to late Po&s;terity: A <HI>Book,</HI> in which there is a faithful Account of the <HI>Actions</HI> &amp; <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our <HI>Fathers,</HI> together with a true Relation of ma|ny remarkable Providences in &s;etling this Land, it's <HI>Churches, Colleges, Schools</HI> and <HI>Inhabitants:</HI> and, in a word, a <HI>Book,</HI> in which the de&s;igns of a <HI>Church Hi&s;tory</HI> are exqui&s;itely accommodated.</P>

BUT I had rather on this occa&s;ion u&s;e the words of Mr. ALSOP (a Gentleman of great <HI>Learning</HI> &amp; <HI>Peity,</HI> as well as of fini&s;hed <HI>Wit</HI>) who, when an <HI>Abridg|ment</HI> of this <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> was propo&s;ed in an A&s;&s;embly of Mini&s;ters, &s;aid; <HI>It is a very improper Propo&s;al; 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to abridge it!

<P>I have &s;everal other Letters by me from Gentlemen beyond Sea, which are <HI>full</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: And here, the Gentlemen at <HI>Scotland</HI> will give me leave to declare it, that they highly valu'd the Performance: and the equally learned and mode&s;t Mr. MILLAR of <HI>Pai&s;ley</HI> in particular will forgive me, if I &s;peak of it, that in his excellent Book of <HI>the Propagation of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> he mentions the Doctor as well as his <HI>Magnalia</HI> with great Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IN de&s;cribing the <HI>Magnalia,</HI> I mentioned <HI>the Lives</HI> in it and their Number: I may take notice here, that by the Year 1718. the Doctor had publi&s;hed the Lives of no le&s;s than <HI>one hundred and fourteen</HI> Men, and more than <HI>twenty</HI> Women, and &s;ince that Year, he has printed Accounts and Characters of many more; not to &s;ay any Thing of the tran&s;ient but ho|nourable mention many others have had in the Doc|tor's Tractates.</P>
<P>BUT I may particularly &s;peak of <HI>the Life</HI> of his <HI>Father,</HI> Publi&s;hed in the Year 1724, which may pa&s;s for an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Magnalia:</HI> It is a very <HI>enter|taining Life;</HI> was well received in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>this</HI> Country; and is worthy to be perus'd by every Man of Sen&s;e, Honor, and Vertue.</P>
<P>THE Doctor has given to the World a Book en|titled, <HI>P&s;alterium Americanum;</HI> the De&s;ign of which was, fir&s;t, to give <HI>in Meetre</HI> an exact and literal

As for the <HI>Illu&s;tratory</HI> part, no Man that has any Value for Di|vine Knowlege can find Fault with it; and as for the <HI>Metrical</HI> Ver&s;ion &s;ome prefer it va&s;tly to <HI>any other;</HI> for as on one hand it has no large <HI>Paraphra&s;e,</HI> nor yet any <HI>Diminution</HI> of the Sen&s;e of DAVID, &s;o on the other it has no Occa&s;ion to &s;elect improper <HI>Words</HI> for the &s;ake of a Rhime.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Directions of a Candidate of the Mini&s;try,</HI> which Dr. MATHER has printed, has occa&s;ioned &s;o many Letters of <HI>Thanks</HI> and <HI>Compliment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> that it would fill a <HI>Volumne</HI> to recite them. And indeed, <HI>(Quis unquam vituperavit?)</HI> Who ever &s;aid a word again&s;t it?</P>
<P>The Doctor's <HI>Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher,</HI> in which the learned World enjoys a rich Trea&s;ure, is a celebrated Piece: An ingenious Gentleman from <HI>London</HI> writes of it "<HI>It is the Glory of</HI> New-England, <HI>as it is the Admiration of</HI> Old.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Ratio Di&s;ciplinae Fratrum Nov-Anglorum,</HI> (which Title he borrow'd from COMENIUS,) has had very great Encomiums.&mdash;One of the mo&s;t fini&s;h'd <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Scholars</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> one who was born for Government over Men as well as to be a Ruler in the Common-wealth of <HI>Learning,</HI> and one who is <HI>Delicium Humani Generis,</HI> has been pleas'd to write of that Book, that <HI>'it is a decent con&s;i&s;tent Method of Church-Government".</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have writ of one or two of the Doctor's Books, which produced him the <HI>greate&s;t E&s;teem;</HI> the&s;e I cho&s;e to &s;peak of, becau&s;e they were compo&s;ed with &s;trong Tho't and great Application.</P>

WHEN the <HI>Diploma</HI> was &s;ent unto Dr. MATHER, the mo&s;t excellent <HI>Vice-Chancellor</HI> of the Univer&s;ity wrote very kindly to him I will take the very great Freedom to quote a Paragraph or two of his Letter;
<Q>The high Value (writes he the Univer&s;ity here has for you, I hope, you will no longer doubt, when I tell you, they have confer'd the highe&s;t Academical Degree upon You the Doctorate in Divinity; which <HI>I am per&s;uaded is but what you de&s;erve.</HI> Be plea&s;ed therefore to receive your <HI>Di|ploma,</HI> which could not be &s;ent &s;ooner, in regard no &s;uch &s;ure Occa&s;ion offered until now. Sir, I &s;hall henceforth reckon you under a nearer Rela|tion to this Society, and as one of us.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dean of the Faculty</HI> al&s;o about the &s;ame time writes thus: <Q>Upon a Motion made in the Fa|culty of this Univer&s;ity, that &s;ome Te&s;timony be given of the Sen&s;e we have of your Merit, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed unto, that the Honor of <HI>Doctor of Divinity</HI> &s;hould be conferred on you. And, according to the Power they have by their Founda|tion Charter, granted &s;ome Hundreds of Years ago, They have (di&s;pen&s;ing with your Ab&s;ence) created you <HI>Doctor of Divinity;</HI> and having ordered your <HI>Diploma</HI> they have &s;igned it, and appended the Univer&s;ities great Seal. This their Deed is as valid, as any Univer&s;ity in <HI>Europe</HI> can make it</Q></P>
<P>FROM this Time Dr. MATHER had a very intimate Friend&s;hip and Corre&s;pondence with &s;everal Gentle|men of that Univer&s;ity: He heartily lov'd them un|to his Death, and never &s;poke of them but with Terms of the greate&s;t Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>AND, as the very learned Man I quoted above &s;ays, that <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vobis cavendum e&s;t, ne quod non nullis contingit, con|tenti in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">atique &s;olo Doctorum Titulo &s;ludia negligatis; &s;ed danda potius Opera, ut Titulus, iste, Ornamenta&abque;; Doctorum nobis &s;int &s;timuli ad diligentius &s;tudendum &amp; faciendum Officium. <HI>Zanchii Orat de Dignitate &s;tuddi Theolog.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the Title and Ornaments of Doctor's &s;hould

<P>WHEN he received his <HI>Diploma,</HI> he immediately look'd upon it as an Encouragement unto him in the Service of CHRIST and HIS Kingdom: He rendred Thanks to Heaven, and beg'd Grace to make &s;uch an Improvement of the Encouragement as might an&s;wer the Demands of Heaven from him: And he &s;et him|&s;elf to con&s;ider, What <HI>Sanctity,</HI> what <HI>Gravity,</HI> what <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> what &s;hining <HI>Abilities</HI> and <HI>Performances</HI> the Church of GOD might ju&s;tly demand from one &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed above any Man in the <HI>American</HI> Co|lonies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have done with this Head, when I have told my Reader of the pious U&s;e he made of his <HI>Ring.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the Doctor's Friends advi&s;ed him to wear his <HI>Signet Ring,</HI> as a Token and A&s;&s;ertion of his <HI>Doctorate in Divinity,</HI> to which he was admitted as above; and not to do it from any Vanity of Orna|ment, but out of Obedience to the <HI>Fifth Command|ment,</HI> which directs us to a&s;&s;ert the Honor of any Dignity, in which the Providence of GOD may &s;tation us.</P>
<P>THE Doctor therefore would wear this <HI>Ring;</HI> and made this Action, &s;o &s;eemingly incon&s;iderable, a great Engine of Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> HE <HI>look'd</HI> on <HI>the Ring</HI> as a <HI>continual Ad|monition</HI> to him, to do <HI>nothing</HI> below the Character, of which that was a Memorial; nothing di&s;agreable to the <HI>Gravity</HI> the <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> and <HI>&s;uperiour Behavior</HI> with which a <HI>Doctorate</HI> ought always to be attended.</P>

<HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE &s;ight of the <HI>Gold</HI> frequently ex|cited <HI>Wi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> in him of this Importance. <HI>May I have the Grace, the Gain of which is better than that of Gold&punc; May I be a Son of Zion compar|able to fine Gold:</HI> And on the <HI>Signet&mdash;May I be pre|&s;erved from &s;o provoking the holy LORD, that if I were a Signet on his Right-Hand, He would pluck me thence!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> ONE Original to the Ceremony of a <HI>Ring</HI> for <HI>Doctors of Divinity</HI> was to intimate, that they &s;hould be ready to &s;et their <HI>Seal</HI> to the Advice which may be received from them. The Doctor im|proved this as a Caution: His Advice was asked on many Occa&s;ions; he would be very con&s;iderate, and on &s;uch Occa&s;ions deliberate and look up to Heaven, de&s;iring to &s;peak nothing but what he &s;hould be will|ing to <HI>&s;eal</HI> it and &s;tand to it.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE Emblem on the Doctor's <HI>Signet</HI> is A TREE with P&s;al. 1.3. written under it; and about it GLASCUA RIGAVIT.

<P N="3">3. THE Re&s;pect which the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in <HI>Lon|don</HI> paid him, did al&s;o very much encourage him, and fortify him in his E&s;&s;ays to do Good, while it added to the &s;uperior Circum&s;tances, in which he was placed above the Contempt of envious Men.</P>
<P>'TWAS in the Year 1714. he received a Letter from the Secretary of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> [RICHARD WALLER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>] dated <HI>Decemb.</HI> 4. 1713. in which are the&s;e Words; <HI>As for your being cho&s;en a Member of the Royal Society, that has been done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th by the Council and Body of the Society: only the Ceremony of an Admi&s;&s;ion is wanting; which, you being beyond Sea, cannot be performed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="003188_0100_0FF0144B708BEAE0">
AFTER this he had &s;everal Letters from many con|&s;iderable Gentlemen of that society, who always Super&s;cribed their Letters to him as <HI>F. R.

<P>BUT there are a few in <HI>New-England,</HI> who, as they grudg'd the Doctor <HI>any</HI> Honor, were &s;o very fooli&s;h and impudent as to doubt, nay to deny his Right unto <HI>that</HI> Title: The Rea&s;on they gave for it was; be|cau&s;e his Name was not in the <HI>Li&s;t of the Members of that Society:</HI> But they are ignorant of it, that, altho' his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in any of his extended Domini|ons may be a <HI>Fellow of the Royal Society,</HI> they may not have their Names in the <HI>Li&s;t</HI> of the Society if they are ab&s;ent; which is the only Rea&s;on why the Doctor's was not. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it be &s;aid, there are the Names of &s;everal <HI>outlandi&s;h</HI> Gentlemen in the Li&s;t; what is this to the purpo&s;e?

<P>BUT the Doctor was very ea&s;y, as well he might; for if he <HI>had not</HI> the due <HI>Title</HI> allowed him, he <HI>de&s;er|ved</HI> it; as his <HI>Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher,</HI> his <HI>Curio&s;a A|mericana,</HI> or Letters to the Royal Society, together with his (unprinted) <HI>Angel of Bethe&s;da</HI> abundantly te&s;tify.</P>

5. I know not how better to di&s;mi&s;s this Head than with a pious Tho't which the Doctor had, upon the <HI>Honors</HI> of this World, and a Name among the Learned of the World.</P>
<P>THERE is (he tho't) an accur&s;ed <HI>Idolatry</HI> com|mitted, when we take Notice of this and that con&s;i|derable in any <HI>Man,</HI> and con&s;ider not at the &s;ame Time the great GOD as the Author of all this Excellency. <HI>Man</HI> ought to be look'd on as nothing, any f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ther than what GOD makes him to be; &s;o that when we &s;ee any thing that looks <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> in any <HI>Man,</HI> it mu&s;t be with &s;en&s;ible Acknowlegements, that <HI>all comes from GOD.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. MATHER therefore trembled, and was fill'd with a &s;huddering Horror, at the Tho'ts of having a <HI>great Name</HI> in the World, or being applauded, ad|mired and mightily talk'd of. The Rea&s;on of this Regret was, becau&s;e he tho't tho&s;e that &s;poke w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of <HI>Him,</HI> would not have the <HI>Piety</HI> to look further than him.

Indeed he was &s;en&s;ible, there would be no <HI>Iniquity</HI> charged on <HI>Him</HI> for the <HI>Sacrilege</HI> into which others fell: But yet beheld it as a great <HI>Infelicity:</HI> He reckon'd him&s;elf <HI>unhappy</HI> in being the <HI>Object</HI> upon which any &s;hould &s;infully <HI>terminate</HI> their Honors and Prai&s;es: He won|derfully abhorred it.</P>

<P><Q>O my dear LORD; Thy FATHER has committed my Soul into Thy Hands: There is a <HI>Covenant of Redemption</HI> in which I am concerned: I know my <HI>Election</HI> by my <HI>Vocation,</HI> and my Concernment in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> by my being made willing to come under the Shadow of thy Wings in <HI>the Covenant of Grace.</HI> Now in that ancient <HI>Covenant</HI> the FATHER &s;aid unto the SON, <HI>Such a Soul there is that I will bring into thy Fold, and Thou &s;halt undertake for that Soul, as a &s;ufficient and an eternal SAVIOUR.</HI> Wherefore I am now in thy Hands, O my LORD: Thy FATHER has put me there, and I have put my &s;elf there; O &s;ave me, heal me, work for me and in me the good Plea&s;ure of thy Goodne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>AND a little after I read as follows;</P>
<P><Q>LORD, I have been leaving my Soul with my LORD JESUS CHRIST; and THOU ha&s;t bid me to <HI>believe</HI> I &s;hall be &s;aved by HIM. LORD, I do <HI>believe</HI> that there never came a mi&s;erable Soul unto CHRIST in vain, and I <HI>believe</HI> that I my &s;elf &s;hall not find it in vain. He will <HI>do great Things</HI> for me. He has done enow already to leave me with|out any Cau&s;e of Repenting that I have with &s;o much Agony of Soul come unto HIM. But I <HI>be|lieve,</HI> that he hath <HI>more</HI> &s;till to do for me. Having been the <HI>Author</HI> he will be the <HI>Fini&s;her</HI> of my <HI>Faith.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. ONE &s;pecial Character upon the <HI>Experiences</HI> of his Life, was the great and clear Application he had made unto the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST</HI> for his <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> before the Holy GOD.</P>
<P>I cannot well entertain my Readers with an Article of more Importance than this; I will therefore tran|&s;cribe a few <HI>&s;elect Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> from his Memorials, which are worthy of a more than ordinary Con&s;idera|tion and Attention.</P>

AT one Time he writes thus;</P>
<Q><P>IN the former Part of this Day, I humbled my&s;elf before the LORD with inexpre&s;&s;ible Agony of Soul for all the <HI>Filthine&s;s</HI> of my Heart and Life: I did with Tears bewail my &s;infulne&s;s before the LORD: and &s;ubmitting my &s;elf unto the Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> which might uncontrolably make me a <HI>Ve&s;&s;el of Di&s;honour</HI> and an In&s;tance of Confu&s;ion: I further acknowledged that the Divine <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> added to Sovereignty had farther Advantages to proceed again&s;t me, and make me a dreadful Monument of <HI>Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I was in the mid&s;t of my di&s;con&s;olate Re|flections, the SPIRIT of the LORD cau&s;ed me to behold the <HI>Obedience,</HI> the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and the <HI>Sureti|&s;hip</HI> of my precious REDEEMER, as provided by the FATHER for the Relief of my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es: And that good SPIRIT cau&s;ed me to rely upon it: So that I &s;aid with Tears of Joy before the LORD; <HI>Now I know that all my Debts are paid; my GOD will now make no Demand of me, but that I love HIM and prai&s;e HIM, and glorify my ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR for ever. I know it! I know it! And now I will do &s;o forever! I can do no other.</HI></P></Q>
<P>AT another Time;</P>
<P><Q>I experienced an un&s;peakable Satisfaction of Soul this, Day, when taking part with the LORD again&s;t <HI>my Self,</HI> I approved all His <HI>Laws,</HI> and abhor'd my &s;elf on the &s;core of my Contrariety to them and Vi|olation of them; and I ju&s;tified all the Cha&s;ti&s;e|ments that had therefore befallen me: And then with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avi&s;hed Soul, I felt the LORD a&s;&s;uring me that His <HI>free Grace</HI> would impute unto me the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time <HI>imprint</HI> upon me an holy Di&s;po&s;ition to conform unto that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in my own Heart &amp; Life.</Q></P>

<P><Q>THIS Day my Spirit was exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at the View of my own manifold pre&s;ent and former <HI>Vilene&s;&s;es,</HI> which I bitterly bewailed before GOD.</Q> &mdash; But I find his Humiliations concluded thus;</P>
<P><Q>&mdash;AND yet after all this, <HI>I do Believe, LORD Help my Unbelief!</HI> I <HI>Beleeve,</HI> that my precious SAVIOUR our <HI>Immanuel</HI> hath fully obeyed and &s;uffered Thy Will, as a Surety in the Room of Sin|ners. I <HI>Beleeve,</HI> that the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of this our <HI>Surety</HI> is offered unto my Acceptance, that for the &s;ake of it I may become accepted with GOD.

<P N="3">3. IT was the <HI>Heaven</HI> of the Doctor's Soul, This he cho&s;e and beg'd, to be made <HI>an In&s;trument of ex|hibiting the Glory of CHRIST</HI> unto HIS People, of inviting and inducing others to glorify HIM.</P>
<P>HE received a Letter once, a &s;hort Letter from a very Religious Man, which had this Pa&s;&s;age in it.</P>
<P><Q>YOU'L pardon my troubling you with a Line or two to thank you for your <HI>Ma&s;chil, [the Title of a Book the Doctor had publi&s;hed.]</HI> which I think may be called <HI>Mictam,</HI> as well as <HI>Ma&s;chil.</HI> You help me to this Tho't; How full of Excellency is the glorified Man the LORD JESUS CHRIST;

<P>UPON this I &s;et my &s;elf to form &s;ome Tho'ts on my mo&s;t amiable SAVIOUR, His <HI>Glories,</HI> His <HI>Me|rits,</HI> His <HI>Pattern,</HI> His <HI>Maxims,</HI> what HE <HI>has done,</HI> and what HE <HI>will do</HI> for us.

<P>I find that where CHRIST comes, a wondrous <HI>Light, Life</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> comes with Him, together with a <HI>Strength</HI> to go thro' Services and Sufferings.

<P><HI>NOW, O my dear JESUS, I know, I have an internal Witne&s;s, that THOU art the SON of GOD and the SAVIOUR of the World.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="92" REF="003188_0114_0FF0146E4B15D848">
WHEN <HI>the Cloud of Glory,</HI> which was the SHE|CHINAH that had our SAVIOUR with the <HI>An|gels of his Pre&s;ence</HI> dwelling in it, came down and filled the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, what a <HI>grateful Spectacle</HI> was it, and what Acclamations did it rai&s;e in the Spectators? A godly Man is a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD; a <HI>living Temple;</HI> dearer to Him than any Temple of <HI>mere Matter,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t &s;plendid and co&s;tly in the World. And our SAVIOUR comes into an <HI>Heart</HI> which is continually in&s;tructing, reforming and &s;olacing it &s;elf by <HI>thinking</HI> on Him. O <HI>Heart</HI> panting after thy SAVIOUR; &s;o kind is He, &s;o very kind, that even at the Call of a <HI>Tho't</HI> He will come in unto Thee! A <HI>Temple</HI> &s;o filled with <HI>the Glory of the LORD</HI> is un&s;een to the &s;tanders by, to <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood.</HI>&mdash; The <HI>Life</HI> of the pious Man is <HI>hid with CHRIST in GOD:</HI> It is an <HI>hidden Life.</HI> But GOD &s;ees the Temple with Plea&s;ure. The SAVIOUR who <HI>knoweth all Things</HI> is plea&s;ed with the &s;ight. His <HI>Angels</HI> make their Acclamations upon it.</P>
<P>BUT that I may &s;et this important Matter, yet in a fuller Light I &s;hall be more punctual and par|ticular in my Account.</P>
<P>I behold the Infinite GOD in His Eternal SON a&s;&s;uming the Man JESUS, into &s;uch an intimate and con&s;cious Union with Him, that in my SAVIOUR I now &s;ee a GOD-MAN, and a MAN, who has <HI>the Fulne&s;s of the GOD-HEAD per&s;onally dwelling in Him.</HI></P>
<P>IN this GOD-MAN I behold all po&s;&s;ible Provi|&s;ion for the happy Return of <HI>Man</HI> unto GOD, and all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement unto <HI>Man</HI> to &s;eek and look for &s;uch an Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AS this my SAVIOUR is very GOD, and my <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> in Him is all animated from that Con&s;ideration; &s;o, being one GOD with the FA|THER and SPIRIT, who thro' Him communicate

<P>THE fir&s;t Thing I do, is to accept the <HI>Offers</HI> which this wonderful SAVIOUR makes to me of be|ing <HI>mine</HI> and bringing me to GOD. I hear Him graciou&s;ly offering to make me <HI>Righteous</HI> &amp; <HI>Holy,</HI> reconcile me to GOD, quicken me to Live unto Him, and <HI>work in me that which &s;hall be well-plea|&s;ing</HI> before Him.

<P>AND now what remains is, that as I <HI>wor&s;hip GOD in the Spirit,</HI> &s;o I may <HI>rejoice in CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE in the fir&s;t Place I ask it of the glorious GOD with the Importunity, that having CHRIST <HI>concerned</HI> for me, I may al&s;o have HIM <HI>po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing</HI> of me; That I may have Skill, Will and Help from Heaven to <HI>conver&s;e</HI> with HIM conti|nually; That I may be &s;o well of it as to keep con|tinually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alling HIM into my <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and feeding upon HIM.

<P>MY Life is full of <HI>Sacrifices:</HI> But that which car|ries me well thro' them all is this Con&s;ideration; That <HI>While I have CHRIST, I have enough; I can rejoyce in</HI> HIM <HI>while I have nothing el&s;e left unto me!</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. THAT Dr. MATHER might <HI>walk in the fear of the LORD all the Day long,</HI> his Mind was continu|ally conver&s;ing with GOD and preparing for Heaven in <HI>Occa&s;ional Prayers and Meditations.</HI> His Opinion and Per&s;ua&s;ion concerning <HI>&s;uch Tho'ts</HI> was, that while He was forming of <HI>them</HI> He was directly, nearly, &s;weet an&s;wering the <HI>Grand End</HI> of his Life, which is to <HI>Glorify GOD and acknowledge HIM;</HI> That He was al&s;o therein <HI>rectifying</HI> his Soul and <HI>ripening</HI> it for the <HI>Employments</HI> and Enjoyments of the Heavenly World.</P>

<P>WHEN He heard a <HI>Clock &s;trike,</HI> He could not help thinking and wi&s;hing, that He might <HI>&s;o number</HI> his <HI>Days as to apply</HI> his <HI>Heart to Wi&s;dom;</HI> and that He might &s;o &s;pend every Hour as to be <HI>able to give a good Account</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AT the Winding up of his <HI>Watch,</HI> He ble&s;s'd GOD for another Day and de&s;ir'd He might &s;pend it in En|deavours to glorify HIM.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Comfortable Things</HI> He &s;aw any other. Per&s;on enjoy He took the Comfort of it, adored <HI>the Goodne&s;s of Heaven</HI> and wi&s;hed for a <HI>right Improve|ment</HI> of it.</P>

<P>WHEN He di&s;pen&s;ed <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> to any Per&s;on, He would at the &s;ame Time lift up a Prayer for them, that they might not be unmindful of &s;uch Duty to HIM as thro' this Kindne&s;s they might be invited to.</P>
<P>HE had oftentimes an Opportunity to expre&s;s a Benignity to <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it Creatures,</HI> either to feed them or make their Condition ea&s;y to them: He would do it with Delight and rai&s;e two Meditations upon it.

<P>WHEN he <HI>knocked</HI> at a Door, the Faith of our SAVIOUR'S Promi&s;e was awakened in Him, <HI>Knock and it &s;hall he opened unto You.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he mended his <HI>Fire,</HI> it was with a Medita|tion how his <HI>Heart and Life might be rectified,</HI> and how thro' the Emendations of Divine Grace <HI>His Love and Zeal might flame more agreably.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he put out his <HI>Candle,</HI> it mu&s;t be done with an Addre&s;s to <HI>the Father of Lights,</HI> that his <HI>Light might not be put out in Ob&s;cure Darkne&s;s;</HI> and with a Wi&s;h that <HI>when He goes out by Morta|lity He might enter everla&s;ting Life and Light.</HI></P>
<P>AS he ta&s;ted of the &s;everal <HI>Fruits</HI> which are the rich Product of <HI>Summer,</HI> he would &s;et Him&s;elf to think on &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial Glory</HI> of our SAVIOUR, of which he might by it be lead unto the Contempla|tion, and &s;o addre&s;s HIM with a rapturous Confe&s;&s;ion of it.</P>

<P>WHEN he paid what he <HI>ow'd</HI> at any Time, he would reflect on what he <HI>ow'd CHRIST for pay|ing his Debt tot he Ju&s;tice of GOD,</HI> and was de&s;i|rous that he &s;hould <HI>owe no Man any thing but Love.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> for the Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Piety</HI> and Thankfulne&s;s, he would affectionately take No|tice of the <HI>mean Employments</HI> wherein he &s;aw other People occupied.

<P>IF any Thing began to rai&s;e any Ebullition of <HI>An|ger</HI> in him, he would endeavor to allay it by think|ing, <HI>"What Provocations have I given to the great

THERE was once a Time and a Thing in which the Doctor was full of di&s;tre&s;s.

In this Time he rarely let a Week pa&s;s without &s;etting apart a <HI>Day for Fa&s;ting with Prayer</HI> for many <HI>Months</HI> together; and ever now and then he had his <HI>Vigils</HI> for a Conver&s;ation with Heaven; and every Day for the mo&s;t part he had one &s;ecret Prayer more than he u&s;ed to have and lay pro&s;trate in the Du&s;t with Tears before the LORD, yet he tho't it nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;omething more than all this.</P>
<P>HE had often in his Life kept <HI>two Days of Fa&s;ting and Prayer</HI> in <HI>on Week:</HI> But now he was re&s;olved to &s;pend <HI>Three Days</HI> after this manner in his Study, and <HI>be&s;eech the LORD thrice, knocking</HI> at the Door of Heaven for <HI>three Days together;</HI> and he was car|ried thro' the Undertaking even beyond what his feeble Con&s;titution could have looked for.</P>
<P>HE was de&s;irous that <HI>each Day</HI> &s;hould have it's <HI>peculiar Character,</HI> tho' there were many <HI>general Strokes</HI> of Devotion which were common to all the Days.</P>
<P>THE Character of the <HI>fir&s;t Day</HI> was <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of, and <HI>Contrition</HI> for the Sins which might expo&s;e him to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven; (in which he u&s;ed a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of Things <HI>forbidden and required in the Commandments,</HI> as well as the Ingredients of <HI>Original Sin</HI>) and he petitioned for the Pardon of all thro' the Blood of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE Character of <HI>the &s;econd Day</HI> was <HI>Re&s;ignati|on to the Will of GOD</HI> in whatever Sorrows had be|fallen him, and in the &s;orrowful things which he could imagine might po&s;&s;ibly be inflicted on him He found a&s;toni&s;hing Entertainment from Heaven in this Action.</P>

I &s;aw that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> mentioned the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the good <HI>Angels,</HI> about <HI>the Heirs of Salvation</HI> with Frequency; and I &s;aw that my Life had been wondrou&s;ly &s;ignalized by the Mini&s;try of tho&s;e <HI>An|gels.</HI> Wherefore loth to be guilty of &s;uch an un|thoughtful Neglect of the <HI>Angels</HI> as the Generality of the Faithful who enjoy the A&s;&s;i&s;tances of tho&s;e <HI>Heavenly Guardians</HI> are, I devoted this Day to glorify the GOD and Father of my LORD JESUS CHRIST for <HI>the Mini&s;try of ANGELS,</HI> which has notably befriended me unto this very Day.

HE returned to his Study, and pray'd that the <HI>pub|lic Sacrifices,</HI> to which he was going might be pro|fitably and acceptably carried on.</P>
<P>HE went unto the Public, where his venerable Parent performed the public Mini&s;trations.

<P>AFTER this, he went on to the Affairs of the great <HI>Sabbati&s;m.</HI> He read a Paragraph of Scripture referring to it, with his acute&s;t and mo&s;t penetrating Tho'ts upon it and &s;uitable Ejaculations. And he &s;ang an Hymn relating to it.</P>
<P>THEN pro&s;trate in the Du&s;t, he poured out a Prayer for <HI>Zion in the Du&s;t,</HI> and for the Ha&s;tening of the Day of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="003188_0154_0FF014D256E67128">
UPON this he took the <HI>Sermon</HI> He was to preach immediately, and run it over &s;o that his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d was formed into proper Tempers and Wi&s;hes on every Head of the Sermon.</P>

<P>HE went unto the public, and &s;pent about three Hours in carrying on the Services there, in a <HI>great A&s;&s;embly</HI> with great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Heaven.</P>
<P>HIS Mind, between the Conclu&s;ion of the Services, and his <HI>vi&s;iting of his Habitation,</HI> was filled with Prayers that what had pa&s;&s;ed might make due Im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the People.</P>
<P>EXCESSIVELY tired he drank his beloved <HI>Tea,</HI> with Prai&s;es to the glorious GOD, and &s;ome Tho'ts on his precious Benefits to which the Water led him.</P>
<P>HE made a Prayer for &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings as he was daily to ask for.</P>
<P>HE went down to his <HI>Family;</HI> where he <HI>catechized</HI> his Children; and went thro' the Sermons of the Day in a way of Dialogue with them; and &s;ang and pray'd with them and the Neighbours that came in to join with them.</P>
<P>THEN he cau&s;ed &s;uch of his Children as could do &s;o, to tell him, <HI>What new Matter of Prayer they were apprehen&s;ive of?</HI> And he charged them to re|tire with it before the LORD.</P>
<P>HAVING al&s;o ordered one of his Sons to hear the Servants read &amp; &s;ay their Catechi&s;m: he retired unto his Study and meditated on that Point; <HI>What have I l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t undone that it would be for my Con&s;olation and Satisfaction to do before I dy?</HI></P>
<P>HE read in a Book of Piety, a Sermon that might add unto the Heavenly Tincture on his Mind.</P>
<P>HE was called to <HI>pray with a Sick Per&s;on,</HI> unto which he went with Alacrity as unto a Duty of the <HI>Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="003188_0155_0FF014D4A0FBA250">
HE went again to his Family, and &s;at with them, while each of the capable Children &s;ucce&s;&s;ively read their &s;everal parts of &s;ome <HI>Book of Dovotion</HI> to the whole Family: And he took Occa&s;ion from thence to renew his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tructions to them.</P>
<P>THEN he &s;ang with his Family his <HI>Evening Hymn.</HI></P>
<P>HE returned to his Study, and in Prayer gave Thanks for the <HI>Mercies</HI> of the pa&s;t Day; and im|plored a Pardon for the <HI>Errors,</HI> of it, both of which he endeavoured particularly to enumerate. He committed all his Intere&s;ts into the Hands of his dear SAVIOUR, and exerted a <HI>Principle of Grace</HI> in an <HI>Act</HI> that was <HI>an evident Token of Salvation,</HI> that might a&s;&s;ure him of his Safety if he were to dy before the Morrow.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> HE declared before the LORD, that altho' &s;ome had ob&s;erved a Reward of <HI>Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> even in the en&s;uing Week to encourage their <HI>Sabba|tizing,</HI> he had been <HI>abounding in this Work of the LORD</HI> without the Encouragement of any &s;uch Expectation.

<P>THIS Variety of Duty (I find) was done by him on <HI>one Sabbath:</HI> And altho' he found him&s;elf very <HI>weary,</HI> yet his Spirit found tho&s;e un&s;peakable Con|&s;olations and Advantages from &s;uch <HI>unwearied Sab|batizing,</HI> as carry'd rich Compen&s;ations with them.</P>
<P N="4">[4] WHEN he <HI>read the Scriptures,</HI> he had one very holy and u&s;eful Practice in it.</P>

<P N="1">1. THE very learned and good DRUSIUS &s;ays, that his <HI>Old Age was better to</HI> him <HI>than</HI> his <HI>Youth.</HI> So was Dr. MATHER'S: He was generally more hearty in his <HI>latter</HI> Years than former; and, altho' he was always very <HI>temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rate,</HI> in his later Times he was exceedingly re|gular; in every Thing but <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Writing,</HI> for he was as con&s;tantly employ'd in the&s;e, as if he had but newly taken a <HI>Pen</HI> or <HI>Book</HI> into his Hand.</P>

Hence likewi&s;e he was care&s;s'd by all that knew him (tho' in his latter Days he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided Company as much as he could) and was re&s;orted to by Per&s;ons of all Characters for his Directions.

3. I mu&s;t relate one Thing by which all Parents would do well to receive In&s;truction, 'tis this; He would not, as I more e&s;pecially <HI>know</HI> in his <HI>latter Days,</HI> keep a <HI>moro&s;e Carriage</HI> towards his Children, nor at an <HI>haughty Di&s;tance</HI> from them; but forever when they came into his Pre&s;ence he would conde&s;cend to the <HI>Familiarity of an Acquaintance;</HI> and thus he would in&s;truct and edify, thus allure and charm us, thus make us love his Society, ever come into it with Delight and never leave it but with Sorrow: &mdash; Which Method, I believe, will work more forcibly upon any Children of common Sen&s;e and more en|gage them to love their Parent and encline them to be good and vertuous, than any crabbed Looks, au&s;tere Orders or &s;urly Demands whatever.</P>
<P N="2">2. His <HI>Sentiments upon &s;ome important Things.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. ALTHO' he was a Defender of the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Articles of the Church of England;</HI> and, as to <HI>Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> was of <HI>Con|gregational Principles,</HI> which he looked on as mo&s;t agreable to the Word of GOD and <HI>the Rights of the Chri&s;tian Church;</HI> yet he was very exten&s;ive in his Charity, being de&s;irous to receive all whom CHRIST receives to the Kingdom of GOD, <HI>viz.</HI> All who <HI>fear GOD and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> all who do not <HI>abet Errors</HI> and <HI>indulge Practices</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with the Chri&s;tian Life: And being of &s;uch a charitable and good Temper, he mu&s;t needs be an Enemy to <HI>all Per&s;ecution</HI> as he was. He tho't that a good <HI>Subject</HI> and good <HI>Neighbour</HI> had a <HI>Right to Life</HI> and the Comforts of it, let his Opinion in Religion be what it will, He early imbib'd this Opinion, grew &s;trong in it, left it behind him and to the la&s;t, was an En|courager of <HI>manly Religion</HI> without any bitter Spirit common to this <HI>Party</HI> and that <HI>Faction.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As it is well known that Dr. MATHER was well acquainted with <HI>the Sacred Prophecies,</HI> on which he formerly writ and printed his Tho'ts; &s;o it may not
<PB N="141" REF="003188_0163_0FF014E9748F98D0">be ami&s;s to inform my Reader, that, in &s;everal Things relating to the Prophecies, he &s;aw cau&s;e to <HI>alter his Mind;</HI> particularly concerning <HI>the &s;econd Coming of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Conflagration, the New Heavens and New Earth,</HI> and <HI>the Calling of the Jews.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I will here write tho&s;e Sentiments of the&s;e Things of which the Doctor ju&s;t before he died had a firm Belief from a &s;trict Enquiry, long Study and much Prayer; and, as near as I can, I will expre&s;s his Sen|timents in his own Words in the following A&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE <HI>&s;econd Coming</HI> of the LORD will be <HI>at</HI> and <HI>for</HI> the De&s;truction of <HI>the Man of Sin</HI> and the Ex|tinction of <HI>the Roman Monarchy</HI> under <HI>the Papal Form</HI> of it. He tho't that, altho' Wi&s;e Men have interpreted our SAVIOUR'S <HI>Coming in the Clouds of Heaven</HI> and <HI>the Brightne&s;s of his Appearance</HI> as if it me'nt any Thing be&s;ides <HI>His Per&s;onal Coming,</HI> herein they &s;poke fooli&s;hly and unaccountably. For as their Interpretations leave us de&s;titute of any Proof that our LORD will <HI>ever come at all,</HI> &s;o they go very far towards a Tre&s;pa&s;s on the <HI>third Commandment.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE <HI>Conflagration</HI> de&s;cribed by the Oracles of GOD in &s;trong Terms, and which we are warned of <HI>by the Mouth of all the Prophets;</HI> this <HI>Conflagration</HI> will be at the <HI>&s;econd Coming</HI> of the LORD. To make the <HI>Petrine Conflagration</HI> &s;ignify no more than the laying of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and her Daughter in A&s;hes: And to make the <HI>New Heavens</HI> and the <HI>New Earth</HI> &s;ignify no more than <HI>the Church State of the Go&s;pel.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e are &s;hameful Hallucinations. And as for the <HI>New Earth,</HI> before the Arrival of which no Man can rea&s;onably expect <HI>happy Times</HI> for the Church of GOD upon Earth, it is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity to &s;ay that it will take Place before <HI>the Petrine Conflagra|tions;</HI> and there is no Pro&s;pect of arguing to any Purpo&s;e with &s;uch as can talk &s;o very ridiculou&s;ly.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="142" REF="003188_0164_0FF014EBEFDA2EE0">
3. UPON <HI>the Conflagration</HI> the glorious GOD will <HI>create New Heavens and a New Earth.</HI> In the up|per Part of our <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> where will be the <HI>New Heavens,</HI> there will be the <HI>holy City</HI> which GOD has prepared for his People. This <HI>holy City</HI> will be in|habited by the <HI>rai&s;ed Saints,</HI> attending on our SA|VIOUR there and receiving the inconceivable Re|compences of all their Services &amp; Sufferings for Him. The <HI>New Earth</HI> will be a <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> prepar'd for another People &amp; <HI>full of the goodne&s;s of the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. IT is impo&s;&s;ible to find any Inhabitants for the <HI>New Earth,</HI> but a &s;et of People that &s;hall e&s;cape the <HI>Conflagration.</HI> It is a Thing plainly revealed unto us, that our de&s;cending Redeemer, while yet at a further Di&s;tance than he will anon come, when he &s;ets <HI>Fire</HI> to the Earth, will by his Almighty Voice <HI>rai&s;e the Dead,</HI> whom he intends for Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, &s;o fetch them to him as to <HI>bring them with him:</HI> As he is going on in his nearer Approaches with his illu&s;trious Re|tinue to give Order for the tremendous <HI>Fire,</HI> he will hear the Cries of his cho&s;en, called and faithful ones, and he will &s;end <HI>His Angels</HI> to do for them as once for ELIJAH; The&s;e <HI>Hundred and forty four Thou|&s;and</HI> Servants of GOD and Walkers with HIM, that have <HI>the Mark</HI> of GOD upon them, when the <HI>De&s;troyers</HI> are going to <HI>hurt the Earth,</HI> &s;hall be <HI>caught up to meet the LORD</HI> and with HIM they &s;hall be in Safety, while they &s;hall &s;ee the <HI>Earth</HI> flaming under them. The&s;e are they who &s;hall return to the <HI>New Earth,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s it, and people it, they &s;hall &s;oon multiply in|to mighty Nations upon it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THE Proce&s;s of <HI>Judgment</HI> on the <HI>Sheep &amp; Goats,</HI> in the <HI>twenty fifth</HI> Chapter of <HI>Matthew,</HI> has not one of the <HI>Rai&s;ed from the Dead</HI> concerned in it; but it is a quick Divi&s;ion &amp; Deci&s;ion made by our LORD among the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> who cry for <HI>Mercy,</HI> when they &s;ee <HI>the Fire of GOD</HI> ready to &s;eize upon them, de|termining who &s;hall be <HI>caught up to meet the LORD,</HI> and who &s;hall be left to <HI>the Perdition of ungodly
<PB N="143" REF="003188_0165_0FF014EDC09F7450">Men in the Flames</HI> before them; and there &s;hall not one <HI>ungodly Man</HI> be left living in the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. THE <HI>rai&s;ed Saints</HI> in the <HI>New Heavens</HI> will <HI>not marry nor be given in marriage,</HI> but be <HI>equal with the Angels;</HI> The <HI>changed Saints</HI> on the <HI>New Earth</HI> will <HI>build Hou&s;es and inhabit them, plant Vineyards and eat the Fruit of them,</HI> and will have <HI>an Offspring that will be with them the ble&s;&s;ed of the LORD;</HI> and if <HI>ble&s;&s;ed;</HI> then <HI>&s;inle&s;s</HI> and <HI>deathle&s;s:</HI> The &s;acred Scriptures have expre&s;&s;ly declared this Difference between them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. WHILE the <HI>holy People</HI> on the <HI>New Earth</HI> &s;hall be circum&s;tanced like <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Eve in Paradi&s;e,</HI> in a pure and &s;potle&s;s Manner Living unto GOD; the <HI>Rai&s;ed Saints,</HI> being &s;omewhat more <HI>Angelically</HI> circum&s;tanced, will be &s;ent from Time to Time down from the <HI>New Heavens</HI> unto them to be their <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> and have <HI>Power over Nations,</HI> and the Will of GOD will be <HI>done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> This Di&s;pen&s;ation will continue at lea&s;t for a <HI>thou&s;and Years.</HI> Whether the Tran&s;lations from the <HI>New Earth</HI> to the <HI>New Heavens</HI> will be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively during the <HI>thou&s;and Years,</HI> or all to|gether after it, has not been di&s;covered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. THE <HI>New Heavens,</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>New Earth</HI> under the Influence of it, is that <HI>Heavenly Countrey</HI> which the Patriarchs looked for. When the great GOD promi&s;ed them that he would <HI>be their GOD and ble&s;s them,</HI> they under&s;tood if of his bring|ing them into this <HI>Deathle&s;s and Sinle&s;s World.</HI> They who expect the <HI>Re&s;t</HI> promi&s;ed for the Church of GOD upon Earth to be found any where but in the <HI>New Earth,</HI> and they who expect any <HI>happy Times</HI> for the Church in a World that hath <HI>Death</HI> &amp; <HI>Sin</HI> in it, &mdash; <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e do err, not knowing the Scripture nor the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></ITEM>

9. SUCH a <HI>Conver&s;ion of the I&s;raeliti&s;h Nation</HI> with a Return to their ancient Seats in <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> as many excellent Per&s;ons in latter years (and among the Re&s;t him&s;elf) have been per&s;uaded of: He now tho't in|con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>coming of the LORD</HI> and <HI>the Burning</HI> of the World at the <HI>Fall of Antichri&s;t,</HI> be|fore which Fall no body imagines that <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI> And indeed how is it con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the Deep Sleep</HI> in which the <HI>Diluvium Ignis</HI> mu&s;t, as that of <HI>Water</HI> did, &s;urprize the World?

</LIST>
<P>THE Doctor was very much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e, who, propo&s;ing rather to <HI>carp</HI> than to <HI>&s;earch,</HI> think they have at once routed all Hopes to under&s;tand <HI>the Scriptures</HI> and &s;ecured an unintelligible <HI>Ob&s;curity and Ambiguity</HI> to the <HI>Divine Oracles</HI> only by demanding with an Air of Contempt, <HI>Where will you find Gog and Magog?</HI> They are not ordinarily capable of re|ceiving a Rational An&s;wer till they have more &s;eri|ou&s;ly tho't on what is to arrive a <HI>thou&s;and Years</HI> before the Ri&s;ing of <HI>Gog and Magog.</HI> Suppo&s;e (what in|deed the Doctor would not allow) the Que&s;tion to be unan&s;werable: He would then ask, Is there no <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> concerning the <HI>Rai&s;ed Bodies</HI> of the Faith|ful which the&s;e People will confe&s;s cannot yet be an|&s;wered? And yet, continued he, they will not re|nounce <HI>the Faith of the Re&s;urrection.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctor us'd to &s;ay, <HI>I will al&s;o ask you one Thing, which if you tell me I will in likewi&s;e tell you:</HI> The <HI>Bodies</HI> of the <HI>Rai&s;ed</HI> &s;hall they be furni&s;h|ed with <HI>Teeth</HI> or no? Or I will only ask; Where will you find the <HI>Nations,</HI> over which the <HI>Rai&s;ed Saints</HI> (or the <HI>Overcomers</HI>) are to have <HI>Power?</HI> Tell me <HI>that,</HI> and I will tell you where to find <HI>Gog and Magog.</HI></P>
<P>AND as for tho&s;e who think it improbable or in|credible, that &s;o dreadful a Thing as a <HI>Conflagration</HI> &s;hould be ordered for &s;uch an <HI>evil World</HI> as this; they will do well to think on <HI>the Evil of Sin</HI> and to re|menber that the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> World had us many
<PB N="146" REF="003188_0168_0FF014F6764E11B0">fine <HI>Buildings, Cities</HI> and <HI>Artifices</HI> in it as, and pro|bably more People than, there are in ours. No more than <HI>eight Per&s;ons</HI> were &s;aved out of the De&s;truction which <HI>Flood of Water</HI> bro't upon that World; whereas there will be a great Number, GOD knows how many Thou&s;ands, &s;aved out of the <HI>fiery Flood</HI> which we have to look for.</P>
<P>THUS I have given a brief Account of Dr. MATHER'S late&s;t Sentiments concerning the <HI>&s;acred Prophecies:</HI> I have been the more conci&s;e, becau&s;e I hope I &s;hall procure a Publication of His <HI>Triparadi&s;us;</HI> which will give the World a more ample Account as well as Proof, of his Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Doctor's Temper in his la&s;t Illne&s;&s;es, with the Circum&s;tances of his Death.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. As He had walked <HI>in the Light of GOD's Countenance</HI> thro' the greate&s;t Part of his Life; &s;o in the latter Part of it he had more peculiar and lively Di&s;|plays of the Divine Favor; particularly in his la&s;t Illne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In one Sickne&s;s I find he was &s;ure all his <HI>Sins</HI> were <HI>pardoned,</HI> that he was above the <HI>Fear of Death</HI> and that he e&s;teemed <HI>Patience under Sickne&s;s</HI> to be better than Health it &s;elf.</P>
<P>IN this Illne&s;s I likewi&s;e met with his Enquiries after the Rea&s;ons why mo&s;t Men chu&s;e rather to <HI>Live</HI> than to <HI>Dy?</HI> The Cau&s;es why the Generality de&s;ire <HI>Life,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re either becau&s;e they are <HI>afraid to Dy,</HI> or el&s;e becau&s;e they <HI>Love Creatures</HI> here &s;o well that they are loth to leave them. Now neither of the&s;e Rea&s;ons were &s;ufficient to make the Doctor prefer <HI>Life.</HI> Not the <HI>former,</HI> for he was a <HI>Conqueror and more than a Conqueror</HI> over Death thro' JESUS CHRIST; nor yet the <HI>latter,</HI> becau&s;e he could not be loth to leave the <HI>Streams</HI> to go to the <HI>Fountain,</HI> he loved the <HI>Creator</HI> more than <HI>Creatures.</HI></P>

AND as for his <HI>Advantages for doing Good</HI> in this World; whenever GOD &s;hould plea&s;e to put an End to them, he was &s;satisfied.</P>
<P N="2">2. ONE Day, when he was labouring under &s;ome Infirmities; I find him writing as follows:</P>
<Q><P>WHEN I was pouring out my Prayers unto the LORD, I mentioned the <HI>Prolongation of my Life</HI> to enjoy and improve more Opportunities of glo|rifying Him. In my Prayers, I humbly repre&s;ented to the LORD, that there were two Objections again&s;t my <HI>dying,</HI> which <HI>my Fle&s;h</HI> would be ready to make; but thro' His Grace I had conquered them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, My <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> pleaded that the <HI>Comforts of Earth</HI> were too agreable Things to be ea&s;ily for&s;a|ken. But my <HI>Faith</HI> is per&s;waded and &s;atisfied that the <HI>Delights of Heaven</HI> are &s;weeter than the <HI>Com|forts of Earth;</HI> and I can freely leave all the En|tertainments of this Evil World; that i may be with CHRIST, where to be is <HI>by far the be&s;t of all.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, My <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> pleaded, What will become of my <HI>Offspring</HI> when I am gone? But my <HI>Faith</HI> is per&s;uaded and &s;atisfied, that GOD will be a <HI>Fa|ther</HI> to my <HI>Fatherle&s;s Offspring;</HI> and my LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom I have &s;erved without &s;eek|ing, as many others would have done, to enrich my &s;elf with a Portion for my Children, will marvel|lou&s;ly become &s;uch a <HI>Guardian</HI> unto them, that they &s;hall not <HI>want any good Thing.</HI></P>

THE u&s;ual Method for the Publication of &s;uch a Work, has been by SUBSCRIPTIONS, and in the Propo&s;als to give a computation of the number of Sheets, and the price of the Books to Sub&s;cribers in Quires, and when Bound: But in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e the preci&s;e Number of Sheets cannot ea&s;ily be known, which will occa&s;ion &s;omething of uncertainty.</P>
<P>However, IT is &s;uppo&s;ed that the Work will be contained in <HI>Three Volumns</HI> in FOLIO, and may be afforded for between <HI>Three</HI> &amp; <HI>Four Pounds Sterling;</HI> and in <HI>New-England</HI> Money according as the Exchange &s;hall then be.
