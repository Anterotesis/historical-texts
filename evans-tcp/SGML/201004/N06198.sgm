<HEAD>Admiral <HI>BYNG</HI>'s DEFENCE; As Pre&s;ented by Him to the COURT, on board His MAJESTY's Ship <HI>St. George, January</HI> 18, 1757.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider that the Charge exhibited again&s;t me is of &s;o criminal a Nature, &s;o copious in its Circum&s;tances, and depends on &s;uch a Multiplicity of Facts, I cannot but be very &s;en&s;ible of the Inconvenience I labour under, in being by the Practice of Courts Martial denied the Aid of Council on this Occa&s;ion; and this the rather as I am &s;o little ver&s;ed in the Method of Defence; having, during the Cour&s;e of &s;o long a Service, never yet been reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tudying it.&mdash;What I &s;hall, therefore, now lay before this Court, will have nothing more than plain Truth to &s;upport it&mdash;An Advocate altogether &s;ufficient, where the Candour and Capacity of my Judges will, I am per&s;uaded, &s;upply any Defects and Omi&s;&s;ions which may proceed from my Inadvertency or Inexperience.</P>
<P>It is my Misfortune, to have laboured under the Di&s;advantage of a popular, and almo&s;t national Prejudice.&mdash;For what Rea&s;ons this Spirit has been rai&s;ed and by what Means propagated, is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Court to determine: but I have the Satisfaction to find the Time arri|ved, when I have an Opportunity of approving my Innocence before Judges, who&s;e Integrity is above Corruption, and when my Pro&s;ecutors are Per&s;ons (for &s;uch indeed are the pre&s;ent) who de&s;ire nothing more than equal and impartial Ju&s;tice, and &s;tand indifferent to my Condem|nation or Acquittal. By this means I am at once &s;ecured from being borne down by popular Clamour, or cru&s;hed beneath the Weight of an overbearing Power.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007865_0003_102DEBB065E19608">
It has been &s;aid, and indeed very indu&s;triou&s;ly ecchoed through the whole Kingdom,&mdash;That the Lo&s;s of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle was &s;olely ow|ing to my Mi&s;conduct; and that <HI>Minorca</HI> might have been relieved, if I had done my Duty.&mdash;As this national Calamity has been urged in or|der to excite a national Reproach again&s;t me, I mu&s;t beg Leave, in the fir&s;t Place, to refute this A&s;per&s;ion; and &s;hould this Part of the Accu|&s;ation be once clearly an&s;wered, and the Prejudice removed, certain I am, the Charge of per&s;onal Cowardice, in the Action will &s;oon vani&s;h; for I am confident, had it not been convenient, nay I may &s;ay nece&s;&s;a|ry, for &s;ome Per&s;ons to &s;helter them&s;elves from the former Part of the Charge, no Man living would ever have thought of calling upon me, for a Ju&s;tification with re&s;pect to the latter.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that being accu&s;ed of two Offences, one whereof is capital, the other not, I &s;hould appear more &s;olicitous to acquit my&s;elf of that which is only a Mi&s;demeanour, than of that which directly affects my Life: but how little Regard &s;oever, I may be repre&s;ented, to have had for my Honour, permit me to &s;ay, I &s;till retain &s;o ju&s;t a Sen&s;e of it's Value, as to prefer Death to the Di&s;grace that ought to attend the Author of &s;o inglorious a Calamity to his Country. If then, I can acquit my&s;elf of this Imputation (which I am confident I can) I &s;hall with Spirit proceed to my Defence again&s;t the Charge of Cowardice, and treat it with the Contempt it de&s;erves.&mdash;One Favour I have to beg of the Court, that the two Charges may be kept di&s;tinct, and by no Means blended together, as the Fate of <HI>Minorca</HI> did not at all depend upon this Backwardne&s;s (as it is called) in Time of Action.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and what I think the principal Part of my Defence, con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;atisfying this Court,&mdash;That I did the utmo&s;t in my Power to relieve <HI>Minorca:</HI>&mdash;if in the Cour&s;e of this, I &s;hould happen, from the Nece&s;&s;ity of Self-defence, to glance &s;ome blame upon others, I hope to &s;tand excu&s;ed; e&s;pecially as my Innocence, in many Re&s;pects, is &s;o intimately connected with their Neglect, that a Vindication of the one, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enforce an Expo&s;ition of the other: a hard Nece&s;&s;ity, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, and impo&s;ed upon me much again&s;t my Inclination; &s;ince no Man in my Situation would wi&s;h to contend with &s;uch potent Adver&s;aries. I de&s;ire not to become an Accu&s;er: but if the Lo&s;s of <HI>Minorca</HI> mu&s;t be imputed, either to me, or tho&s;e who &s;ent me on the Expedition, they who have &s;o fal&s;ely fixed the Imputation on me, in
<PB N="5" REF="007865_0004_102DEBB21848C430">
order to protect them&s;elves, can with little Shew of Ju&s;tice complain of my retorting a Charge &s;o unju&s;tly applied to me.&mdash;But to proceed.</P>
<P>In order to determine, whether I did my utmo&s;t on this Occa&s;ion, I apprehend the Con&s;ideration of what I could do, &s;hould be previous to any Determination of what I ought to have done; and give me leave to lay it down as an undeniable Fact, and which I &s;hall prove, That the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was &s;uperior in the Size of their Ships, Weight of Metal, and Number of Men, be&s;ides their Advantage in Point of Sail|ing; which enabled them to fight, or avoid fighting, as be&s;t &s;uited their Purpo&s;es. Though this Facts is now &s;o notorious, yet permit me to ob|&s;erve, that the contrary was with an uncommon, Strain of Indu&s;try and Confidence a&s;&s;erted; nor indeed am I &s;urprized at it's gaining an almo&s;t univer&s;al Credit, when the <HI>Gazette,</HI> a Paper &s;uppo&s;ed to be publi&s;hed by Authority, was pro&s;tituted to &s;pread a fal&s;e Li&s;t of the Strength of both the Fleets among the People, not only by undervaluing the Ene|my's Force, of which it is po&s;&s;ible the Writer might be ignorant, but by over-rating mine, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be innocent.</P>
<P>I do not plead the Superiority of the Enemy as a Rea&s;on for not at|tacking them, but only why &s;uch an Attempt might not only po&s;&s;ibly, but mo&s;t probably be un&s;ucce&s;sful; &s;ince it is evident that notwith|&s;tanding my previous Information of their Strength, I did not he&s;itate to attack, and do the utmo&s;t in my Power to defeat them. And I have the rather been induced, to particularize this Circum&s;tance, becau&s;e you will find, by a Letter to me from the Admiralty&mdash;That the only Rea&s;on pretended for the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from my Command, was retreat|ing from an inferior Force.</P>
<P>Now in&s;tead of my retreating from an inferior Force, that a &s;uperior Force retreated from me, when the Fleet was unable to pur&s;ue, I &s;hall manife&s;t beyond all contradiction, and cannot help ob&s;erving, that per|haps I am the fir&s;t In&s;tance of a Commander in Chief, who&s;e Di&s;grace proceeded from &s;o unfortunate a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k, with what View or Intention I was &s;ent out on this Ex|pedition?&mdash;If it be an&s;wered to protect or relieve <HI>Minorca,</HI> which is the &s;eeming Language of my In&s;tructions.&mdash;I would again a&s;k, Did tho&s;e who &s;ent me, apprehend that <HI>Minorca</HI> could be invaded before my Arrival, and the De&s;cent covered by a &s;uperior Squadron, when they &s;ent me out with &s;o inadequate a Force?&mdash;If they did, their
<PB N="6" REF="007865_0005_102DEBB4372AC1C8">
Conduct is unju&s;tifiable,&mdash;if they did not, their Ignorance is inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>This I pre&s;ume is &s;ufficient to unravel the political Secret&mdash;Why the Enemy's Force has been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly le&s;&s;ened, and mine &s;o ex|travagantly magnified; when at the &s;ame Time it is known to almo&s;t every Man in the Squadron I commanded, that it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal of the wor&s;t conditioned Ships, and mo&s;tly the wor&s;t manned of any perhaps in his Maje&s;ty's Navy.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to affirm, that it was not fore&s;een or expected that the Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> would come to Action; &s;ince it will appear from my very In&s;tructions them&s;elves, that no &s;uch Service was ever &s;uppo&s;ed probable, or that the Enemy could have a Force &s;ufficient to venture an Engagement at Sea&mdash;In the&s;e you will find, I am ordered&mdash;If on my Arrival at <HI>Gibralter,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed out of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> to &s;end a Detachment under the Command of Admiral <HI>We&s;t</HI> after them to <HI>North-America.</HI> Can it be meant that I was to detach eight Ships out of the ten? as no le&s;s would have been nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ure Succe&s;s, and make the &s;u|perior Force ordered in my In&s;tructions.&mdash;Again, I am ordered when ar|rived at <HI>Minorca,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Garri&s;on with Lord <HI>Robert Bertie</HI>'s Regi|ment, and as many Gunners and Men as I could &s;pare out of the Fleet.</P>
<P>Does not this &s;uppo&s;e the Sea to be open, and the Fleet unoppo&s;ed? or the Order would be ab&s;urd; for how could it be expected I &s;hould di&s;arm the Squadron, by &s;ending Part of its proper Complement (which plea&s;e to ob&s;erve the Fuzileers were) on Shore, when the whole was too little to &s;ecure Succe&s;s at Sea?&mdash;I am further Ordered&mdash;If <HI>Mi|norca</HI> was not attacked, to block up <HI>Toulon</HI>&mdash;What! block up a &s;u|perior Fleet with an inferior!&mdash;And all this Service you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve was expected from a Fleet, which when collected, was &s;till inferior to the Enemy's: I &s;ay collected, becau&s;e as the I&s;land was attacked, it is indi&s;putable the Ships, then at <HI>Mahon,</HI> might have been blocked up, and taken or de&s;troyed by the Enemy, as they did not quit the Harbour until two Days after the <HI>French</HI> had arrived off the I&s;land, and part of their Troops were landed, and in the Neighbour|hood of <HI>Mahon.</HI></P>
<P>Does not all this evince, that fighting was the lea&s;t intentional Part of my In&s;tructions? And if the Admiralty had expected an Engage|ment, is it not to be &s;uppo&s;ed they would have &s;ent more Ships, as &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="007865_0006_102DEBB5E8484950">
many fine Ships manned, or nearly &s;o, then lay at <HI>Spithead,</HI> and would have afforded me the u&s;ual and nece&s;&s;ary Supply of Fire&s;hips, Ten|ders, Ho&s;pital and Store-Ships, in&s;tead of avoiding any An&s;wer to my Reque&s;t, that a Frigate might be added to my Squadron, to repeat Sig|nals in ca&s;e of meeting with the Enemy before I joined the Ships then in the <HI>Mediterranean?</HI>&mdash;But indeed I was po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured before my Departure, from the highe&s;t Naval Authority, that the Enemy could not fit out more than &s;ix or &s;even Ships of the Line at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e unfavourable Circum&s;tances, without &s;uch Intelligence of the Enemy's Force as could enable me to judge of it, determined to do my Duty, I took the Command of the Squadron, &s;uch as it was; many Ships foul, and one in particular, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> reported un|fit for the Voyage. With the&s;e I proceeded as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible; and though it has been maliciou&s;ly given out (yet not even pretended in my Charge) that I loitered at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> I &s;hall produce &s;everal Letters and Orders, which will inconte&s;tably prove that I departed thence the very fir&s;t Moment I was enabled to &s;ail.&mdash;Why the Admiral|ty po&s;tponed this Service to others, made me wait, and manned my Ships the la&s;t, I mu&s;t leave them to account for.</P>
<P>When arrived at <HI>Gibralter,</HI> I received certain Intelligence that a De&s;cent was actually made on the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca,</HI> that the Har|bour and whole I&s;land was in the Enemy's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, excepting the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> which was then be&s;ieged by a very con&s;iderable Force at Land, and the Siege covered by a &s;trong Squadron at Sea, &s;u|perior to mine. Every Per&s;on there concluded the Place lo&s;t, and all Relief impracticable; and the Engineers were of Opinion, that is was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to land Men, even if the Sea had been open, and the Enemy had erected Batteries on the two Shores near the Entrance of the Harbour.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own there appeared to me no great Probability of pre&s;erving <HI>Minorca</HI> at this Time; but, however, have the Satisfaction to find that the Mini&s;ters at home, for once at lea&s;t, agreed in Opinion with me, &s;ince the Moment Intelligence came that the <HI>Toulon</HI> Fleet was &s;ailed, and the Troops landed upon the I&s;land, there was not a Man who did not di&s;pair of <HI>Minorca.</HI></P>
<P>Hence I di&s;patched an Expre&s;s with this Account, which was at fir&s;t hu&s;hed up in Silence, afterwards repre&s;ented (without, producing
<PB N="8" REF="007865_0007_102DEBB8279383F8">
it) as the de&s;ponding Letter of a Man who would not fight.&mdash;What Authority the&s;e Gentlemen had for this invidious Prophecy, I am yet at a Lo&s;s to account for, unle&s;s a declared Re&s;olution in its Con|tents to meet the <HI>French</HI> Fleet may be deemed a ju&s;tifiable Foundation for it;&mdash;but the Letter has been laid before the Court.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been given out, no Doubt with the &s;ame uniform ma|licious Intention, to defame every Circum&s;tance of my Conduct; that I made unnece&s;&s;ary Delays at <HI>Gibralter</HI> and this &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;olely on the account of watering.&mdash;I pre&s;ume the Propriety, and indeed the Nece&s;&s;ity will readily appear of furni&s;hing the Fleet with a Sufficiency of Water and Provi&s;ions, which was proceeding upon an Expedition where the only Port capable of &s;upplying it's Wants was known to be in the Enemy's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and who by Intelligence appeared to be well &s;upplied with all Kinds of Nece&s;&s;aries: this was not the Cau&s;e, but Effect of my Stay at this Place, and tran&s;acted during the Execu|tion of other Affairs directed by my In&s;tructions.&mdash;I arrived at <HI>Gibral|ter</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>May</HI> Afternoon, and &s;ailed thence the eighth in the Morning, a &s;pace of five Days only; in which Time I communica|ted my Orders to the Governor relating to a Detachment from the Garri&s;on, waited the Re&s;ult of a Council of War held the 4th, then &s;olicited a Reinforcement to &s;upply the Deficiency of Men in Mr. <HI>Edgecumbe</HI>'s Squadron, occa&s;ioned by the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e who had been di&s;embarked for the Succour of St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s. A Li&s;t of this Reinforce|ment I received the 6th, and &s;hipped them the 7th, which Day the <HI>Experiment</HI> arrived, the <HI>Portland</HI> and <HI>Dolphin</HI> two Days before: the&s;e with the re&s;t of Mr. <HI>Edgecumbe</HI>'s Squadron, were mann'd and equipped in the be&s;t Manner I was able; and without waiting to fully water the Ships, I &s;ailed in the Morning of the 8th, though the Wind was Ea&s;terly, and arrived off <HI>Minorca</HI> the 19th.</P>
<P>Thus far, I will pre&s;ume upon my Innocence; but why (it may be a&s;ked) was not <HI>Minorca</HI> at this Time relieved? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e I was not &s;ent Time enough to prevent the Enemy's landing, and that when I was &s;ent, I was not &s;trong enough to beat the Enemy's Fleet, and rai&s;e the Siege. Let others an&s;wer why I came &s;o late, and why I came &s;o weak, with a Force not calculated for &s;uch an Expe|dition.&mdash;But after the Engagement, it may be &s;aid, I might have re|attacked the Enemy, and landed the Succours: I might, indeed, have
<PB N="9" REF="007865_0008_102DEBBBB77B56B0">
done the fir&s;t, with a Certainty almo&s;t of being defeated; I could not have done the la&s;t, though I had been victorious. Had I been defea|ted, what Refuge would have been left for the &s;hattered Fleet?&mdash;what Security for <HI>Gibralter;</HI> which mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the ha|zard of a &s;udden Siege, without a &s;ingle Ship to defend it? and which Place was equally recommended to my Protection.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems (&s;uch is the Fatality attending my Conduct) that I am even held blameable for calling a Council of War in &s;o critical a Con|juncture; yet when is Advice &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion? I admit where Orders are po&s;itive to fight at all Events, and at all Hazards whatever, it is criminal to deliberate: but was I under any &s;uch Orders?&mdash;let my In&s;tructions &s;peak for me.&mdash; Is a Commander expected to fight in all Situations, and under all Di&s;advantages? &s;ure|ly all Extremes are culpable; and where nothing is to be gained, and all may be lo&s;t, Fighting becomes Pre&s;umptou&s;ne&s;s, Ra&s;hne&s;s or Phrenzy.&mdash;I therefore, beg Leave to recommend to your particular Con&s;ideration, the different Situation of the two Fleets at this Time; and &s;hall refer you to the Minutes of a Council of War, held on board the <HI>Ra|millies</HI> the 24th of <HI>May,</HI> already laid before the Court; and when you &s;hall have duly weighed the Opinion of this Council, the Unanimity of its Members, and their Characters, what Apprehen&s;ions can I have of my Behaviour, on this Occa&s;ion, falling under your Cen&s;ure, &s;ince it would nece&s;&s;arily imply their Guilt.</P>
<P>What I have now offered, being verified by the Te&s;timony of the Witne&s;&s;es, will, I flatter my&s;elf, be abundantly &s;ufficient to exculpate me from the fir&s;t general Charge; and that the Court will be of Opi|nion,&mdash;That I never retarded from the I&s;land 'till it was impracticable to make any further Attempt; and,&mdash;that the Place was not lo&s;t by me, who was too weak to &s;ave it; but by tho&s;e who might have &s;ent double the Force two Months earlier, and neglected it.</P>
<P>Yet permit me to complain, that in order to render me criminal in the Eyes of the People, the &s;ame authorized Paper before-mentioned, was likewi&s;e pro&s;tituted to mangle and curtail my Letter to the <HI>Admi|ralty</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, and &s;ub&s;cribed my Name to my own Defama|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the &s;econd Part of the Charge again&s;t me&mdash;that of Cowardice.&mdash;And tho' I have already taken up &s;o much of your Time, &s;hall make no Apology for your further Patience, as I am con|vinced,
<PB N="10" REF="007865_0009_102DEBBD5BBE1CA0">
Gentlemen, your Impartiality will think no Indulgence too much, where the Life, and, what is &s;till much more, the Honour of an Officer of my Rank in the Service is at Stake: I &s;hall forbear to point out the Con&s;equences to the Service in general, not to furni&s;h even my Enemies with an Opportunity of con&s;truing it an Endeavour to be&s;peak a Partiality.</P>
<P>The 12th Article of War, is that, which provides a pro|per Puni&s;hment for Cowardice, and runs in the following Words.&mdash;<Q>Every Per&s;on in the Fleet, who thro' Cowardice, Negligence or Di&s;affection, &s;hall in Time of Action withdraw, or keep back, or not come into the Fight or Engagement, or &s;hall not do his utmo&s;t to take or de&s;troy every Ship which it &s;hall be his Duty to engage; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve all and every of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, or tho&s;e of his Allies, which it &s;hall be his Duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve, every &s;uch Per&s;on &s;o offending and being convicted thereof by the Sentence of a Court Martial, &s;hall &s;uffer Death.</Q></P>
<P>I would fir&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in order to bring any Per&s;on within the Peril of this Article, he mu&s;t be convicted of Cowardice, Negligence or Di&s;affection; for tho' he &s;hould fail to engage or a&s;&s;i&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> unle&s;s this failure apparently proceeds from one of the&s;e Cau&s;es, He is not Guilty.&mdash;Negligence cannot be taken in &s;o large a Sen&s;e, as to mean every &s;ort of Neglect and Omi&s;&s;ion, but &s;uch gro&s;s Negligence only, as evidently indicates Cowardice or Di&s;affection, &s;uch and &s;uch only can be Penal, and was intended to be made Capital, any other Con&s;truction might expo&s;e the brave&s;t Man that ever commanded to the &s;evere&s;t Penalties, &s;ince a &s;ingle Error in Judgment might render him liable to the mo&s;t capital Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>By this Rule, I mu&s;t de&s;ire, my Conduct may be judged; and if my Intentions appear to be good, and my Courage clear, I ought to &s;tand Acquitted by all good Men, even though my Abilities &s;hould be deem|ed Deficient.</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that this Article of my Charge can only relate to my Per&s;onal Courage and Conduct during the Action, and therefore any Di&s;po&s;ition (admitting it could be corrected) can only be accounted an Error of Judgment.&mdash;I do not mention this to avoid en|tering into that part of my Conduct, &s;ince I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hall be able to &s;hew, con&s;idering the Circum&s;tances, &s;everal Di&s;po&s;itions of the two Fleets, and unavoidable Accidents, that the whole as far
<PB N="11" REF="007865_0010_102DEBBF73774EE8">
as could depend upon me, was conducted with that Propriety and Naval Military Skill which is requi&s;ite in a Commander in Chief&mdash;But the Court will plea&s;e to remember, this is no part of the Charge again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to an Account of the Action, I mu&s;t beg Leave to offer two Ob&s;ervations, and de&s;ire the Court never to lo&s;e Sight of them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That Succe&s;s mu&s;t depend upon Execution as well as Di&s;|po&s;ition; and that no Commander of a particular Ship has a right to deviate from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Di&s;cipline and Rules of the Navy, con|tained in the fighting In&s;tructions, and founded on Experience and ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation; becau&s;e if inferior Officers may judge for them&s;elves, there is an End of all Di&s;cipline, and any Deviation from Orders, mu&s;t tend to di&s;turb and di&s;concert the Admiral's Plan, and throw the whole Fleet into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, That as the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, &s;uperior in Force, waited the Attack, there was no Rea&s;on to apprehend they would avoid the En|gagement; and therefore no Occa&s;ion to hazard a Di&s;order by crowd|ing too much Sail, and making the Attack with Precipitation, contrary to the invariable Practice of every prudent, good or great Officer here|tofore in &s;imilar Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed, in as conci&s;e a Manner as I po&s;&s;ibly can, to lay before the Court a faithful Narrative of the material Tran&s;actions of his Maje&s;ty's Fleet under my Command off the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca,</HI> from the 19th of <HI>May</HI> 1756, to the 24th, both Days inclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>In the Morning at Day-light, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 19th of <HI>May,</HI> I arrived with the Fleet off the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca;</HI> and was then about three or four Leagues di&s;tant from the Shore, the Wind fre&s;h northerly.</P>
<P>Several Ships being at that Time con&s;iderably a&s;tern, in particular the <HI>Defiance,</HI> that had been &s;eparated from the Fleet, on <HI>Monday</HI> Evening before, by not being able to weather the I&s;land of <HI>Cabrera,</HI> when the re&s;t of the Fleet did; I made the Signals for the Captains of the <HI>Phoenix, Che&s;terfield</HI> and <HI>Dolphin;</HI> and &s;ent the&s;e three Frigates ahead of the Fleet, under the Direction of Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> of the <HI>Phoe|nix;</HI> to whom at the &s;ame Time I gave a Letter for General <HI>Blake|ney;</HI> which Letter, though it could not be delivered, I &s;hall beg Leave to read, together with a Copy of my Orders to Captain <HI>Hervey.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> SEND you this by Capt. <HI>Hervey,</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Phoenix,</HI> who has my Orders to convey it to you, if po&s;&s;ible, toge|ther with the enclo&s;ed Packet, which he received at <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>I am extremely concerned to find that Capt. <HI>Edgecumbe</HI> has been obliged to retire to <HI>Gibraltar</HI> with the Ships under his command, and that the <HI>French</HI> are landed, and <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle is inve&s;ted. As I flatter my&s;elf, had I fortunately been more timely in the <HI>Mediterra|nean,</HI> that I &s;hould have been able to have prevented the Enemy's getting a Footing on the I&s;land of <HI>Minorca.</HI></P>
<P>I am to acquaint you, that General <HI>Stuart,</HI> Lord Effingham, and Colonel <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> with about thirty Officers, and &s;ome Recruits be|longing to the different Regiments now in Garri&s;on with you, are on board the Ships of the Squadron; and &s;hall be glad to know, by the return of the Officer, what Place you will think proper to have them landed at.</P>
<P>The Royal Regiment of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fuzilliers, commanded by Lord <HI>Robert Bertie,</HI> is likewi&s;e on board the Squadron, de&s;tined, agreeable to my Orders, to &s;erve on board the Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> unle&s;s it &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary, upon Con&s;ultation with you, to land the Regiment for the Defence of <HI>Minorca:</HI> But I mu&s;t al&s;o inform you, &s;hould the Fuzilliers be landed, as they are Part of the Ship's Com|plements, the Marines having been ordered by the Lord's Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty on board of other Ships at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> to make room for them, that it will di&s;able the Squadron from acting again&s;t that of the Enemy, which I am informed is cruizing off the I&s;land. However, I &s;hall gladly embrace every Opportunity of promoting his Maje&s;ty's Service in the mo&s;t effectual Manner; and &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t you, di&s;tre&s;s the Enemy, and defeat their De&s;igns to the utmo&s;t of my Power.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to favour me with Information how I can be mo&s;t effectually of Service to you and the Garri&s;on; and believe me to be, with great Truth and E&s;teem,</P>

<P>For all the Purpo&s;es contained in this Order, and &s;ome others, I ap|pointed Signals for the Captains of the&s;e Frigates to inform me of their Ob&s;ervations, without the Trouble and Delay of &s;ending Boats.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after Nine, the Frigates having &s;ailed ahead of the Fleet with a fre&s;h Gale, and doubled the Laire of <HI>Mahon,</HI> fell into light Airs of Wind and Calms, under the Land.</P>
<P><HI>About half an Hour after Ten,</HI></P>
<P>The Fleet having al&s;o got round the Laire of <HI>Mahon</HI> with a fre&s;h Gale, fell into light Airs of Wind and Calms; and with the Frigates about a Mile ahead, continued to &s;tand on towards St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="14" REF="007865_0013_102DEBC5E07B1040">
and the Harbour's Mouth, with what Airs of Wind offered, until within the Di&s;tance of about three or four Miles.</P>
<P>At this Time we could &s;ee there was a frequent Exchange of Shot and Shells between the Garri&s;on and the Enemy, who were firing upon the Ca&s;tle, from &s;everal Batteries to the we&s;tward of the Ca&s;tle, and to the ea&s;tward towards Cape <HI>Mola.</HI></P>
<P>While the Fleet was &s;tanding on towards the Ca&s;tle, Captain <HI>Hervey</HI> agreeable to my Directions made a private Signal to Captain <HI>Scrope</HI> of the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> who was left with the Garri&s;on, and had kept the <HI>Dol|phin</HI>'s Barge with him, in hopes that Captain <HI>Scrope</HI> would come off to the Fleet, if it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It may be proper to explain, that each Ship in Mr. <HI>Edgecumbe</HI>'s Squadron had a di&s;tingui&s;hing Signal to give Notice on her, Approach, that it was &s;uch a Ship arrived; Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> made the di&s;tingui&s;hing Signal for the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> to give Notice that it was the <HI>Phoenix</HI> ap|proaching; and at the &s;ame Time threw out a white Pendant at his Mizen Top Ma&s;t Head, the Signal to &s;peak with Capt. <HI>Scrope,</HI> agree|able to the Signals given out by Mr. <HI>Edgecumbe.</HI></P>
<P>The Frigates had made the Signal for &s;eeing Ships in the &s;outh-ea&s;t Quarter; but between eleven and twelve, they were plainly di&s;cover|ed to be the Enemy's Fleet, of which we counted &s;ixteen Sail, at the Di&s;tance of about four or five Leagues, &s;tanding towards us.</P>
<P>The Enemy at this Time were undoubtedly Ma&s;ters of the Har|bour; the light Airs of Wind off the Land, and Calms, made it very uncertain what Time any of the Frigates could get near enough to the Ca&s;tle to make proper Ob&s;ervations; and I apprehend it needle&s;s to explain to my Judges the Con&s;equence of a Frigate's approaching Bat|teries, or rather as many Guns as the Enemy are plea&s;ed to bring to bear, without Wind to keep her under Command. A Swell made the <HI>Phoenix</HI> on this Occa&s;ion in danger of being on Shore upon the Laire, and obliged Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> to get his own, and other Ship's Boats ahead, to tow him off.</P>
<P>No Boat coming off from the Garri&s;on, made it probable that no Boat could come off.</P>
<P>As the Enemy appeared to have Batteries on both Sides of the Ca&s;|tle, it was very improbable that the Frigates could not be able to cover the Pa&s;&s;age of a Boat, with a Letter to the Sally-Port, much le&s;s the Pa&s;&s;age of Boats carrying Troops.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007865_0014_102DEBC78767EF60">
Yet, &s;uppo&s;ing the Frigates had been &s;ufficient, the Nearne&s;s of the Enemy's Fleet &s;tanding towards us, rendered it, as I conceive, impro|per, upon the Brink of an Action, to deprive the Fleet of the U&s;e and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any of the Frigates; but more e&s;pecially of their Men, who were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen &s;uch Ships of the Line, as were mo&s;t &s;ickly, or badly manned.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Robert Bertie</HI>'s Regiment, and the Detachment of about two Hundred and &s;eventy Men from the Garri&s;on of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> made up the Ship's Complements, and &s;erved in the Room of Marines.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Robert Bertie</HI>'s Regiment was intended to &s;erve as Marines, as evidently appears by the Order to me from the Board of <HI>Admiral|ty,</HI> directing the Fuziliers to &s;erve in the Fleet, unle&s;s upon Con&s;ulta|tion with the Governor, it &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary to land them: And likewi&s;e by their Lord&s;hip's Order to put the Marines on board other Ships at <HI>Spithead;</HI> therefore, landing them at this Juncture, had it been practicable, would, as I apprehend, have rendered the Fleet entirely unfit for Action.</P>
<P>All the Reinforcement then for the Garri&s;on, that could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from the Fleet, was about one hundred Officers and Recruits, which was, as it appeared to me, a very incon&s;iderable Reinforcement, and an in&s;ufficient rea&s;on for lo&s;ing Time, and delaying to attack the Enemy's Fleet when in &s;ight; more e&s;pecially as there was very little, or rather no Probability of Succe&s;s, from the Attempt to land them; and as tho&s;e very Recruits, were in a great Mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to a Fleet entering into Action, badly manned in general, and with three hun|dred and &s;eventy one Men &s;ick on board the Line of Battle Ships, as may be &s;een by their weekly Accounts dated the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> which has been laid before the Court.</P>
<P>Thus Circum&s;tanced, I conceive, no prudent Officer would have he&s;itated to conclude, that it was improper in every re&s;pect, to weaken his Maje&s;ty's Fleet, by landing Men before the Action, had it been practicable; and that the mo&s;t immediately nece&s;&s;ary Step was to attack the Enemy's Fleet, and try the Fortune of a Battle.</P>
<P><HI>At half an Hour pa&s;t Eleven;</HI></P>
<P>I therefore made the Signal for calling in the Frigates, bore away for the Enemy, and made the general Signal to cha&s;e, continuing to &s;tand towards the Enemy the remaining Part of that Day, with light Airs of Wind and Calms.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="007865_0015_102DEBC9DC2F4D30">
As Boats could ea&s;ily pa&s;s from Ship to Ship, I made a Di&s;tribution of the Seamen from the Frigates, to &s;trengthen the Line of Battle Ships, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>And Captain <HI>Hervey</HI> acquainting me that the <HI>Phoenix</HI> long before had been reported at home unfit for Service; that he had &s;ufficient Materials on board to fit her as well as the Time and Situation would permit as a Fire&s;hip, and could do it without prejudicing her as a Fri|gate afterwards, if not made U&s;e of; I gave him Orders to do it, and ordered the Schooner to attend and take out her Men, in ca&s;e of her being ordered on Service as a Fire&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>About Six in the Afternoon,</HI></P>
<P>A Breeze of Wind &s;prung up about South-we&s;t and by South, and both Fleets then about four Leagues di&s;tant continued to &s;tand towards each other in the order of Battle.</P>
<P><HI>About Seven,</HI></P>
<P>The two Fleets were di&s;tant about two Leagues from each other when the Enemy tacked; the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet at that Time &s;temming nearly for the Enemy's Van, who of cour&s;e mu&s;t have weathered us if both had &s;tood on; I al&s;o hauled down the Signal for the Line, made the Signal to tack, and tacked nearly about the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Rea&s;ons for tacking were probably an Endeavour to pre&s;erve the Weather-gage, and as Night was near at hand, to avoid the Confu&s;ion of a Night Action, which no doubt would have en&s;ued if both Fleets had continued to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>It appeared to me al&s;o proper to avoid a Night Action, as from many Circum&s;tances there was no Probability that the Enemy would decline coming to Action in the Day: and con&s;idering the Weather-gage of Con&s;equence, if an Enemy has Fire&s;hips, which may occa&s;ion Di&s;order in a Fleet to leeward, even if they &s;hould fail in doing Ex|ecution, and having no Rea&s;on to believe that the Enemy had not Fire|&s;hips,
<PB N="17" REF="007865_0016_102DEBCC0AEB0758">
I judged it mo&s;t proper to &s;tand in &s;hore that Night, and take the Advantage of the Wind, u&s;ually off the Land in the Summer Sea|&s;on, the latter Part of the Nights and Mornings, to gain the Wind of the Enemy again&s;t the next Day, and therefore &s;tood in &s;hore until about half an Hour after Eleven, or near Twelve, and off the re|maining Part of the Night.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day the 20th,</HI></P>
<P>In the Morning, the Wind about South We&s;t by South, a thick Haze prevented our &s;eeing the Enemy's Fleet, and made it uncertain in what Quarter it was; but perceiving two <HI>Tartans</HI> with each a blue Flag at his Ma&s;t-head, in Appearance endeavouring to join the Fleet, as if they had mi&s;took us for the Enemy, I made the Signal for the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> to cha&s;e one in Hopes of procuring Intelligence, and made the Signal for the Rear Admiral to &s;end Ships to cha&s;e the other, who &s;ent the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Defiance.</HI></P>
<P>Cha&s;ing drew the&s;e Ships at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from the Fleet, the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Defiance</HI> two or three Miles to leeward, and the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> four or five Miles upon the lee Quarter, or rather a-&s;tern; wherefore I was apprehen&s;ive of their being &s;eparated from the Fleet, and to prevent &s;uch a Separation, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to tack about a quarter after Six, and &s;tand towards them under an ea&s;y &s;ail. About this Time the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> made the Signal for &s;eeing ten Sail in the North We&s;t Quarter, which for &s;ome Time I was in|clined to believe was the Enemy's Fleet, that might have tacked to the North We&s;tward again &s;ome Time in the Beginning of the Night.</P>
<P>The <HI>Defiance</HI> took the <HI>Tartan</HI> &s;he cha&s;ed, which had upwards of a hundred Soldiers on board with their Officers, part of &s;ix hundred em|barked the Day before from the Enemy's Camp at St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s, to reinforce their Fleet.</P>
<P><HI>At Seven,</HI></P>
<P>Or near about Seven, a Fleet was di&s;covered in the South Ea&s;t Quarter, which proved to be the Enemy, and I made the Signal for calling in all the cha&s;ing Ships, which the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> did not im|mediately ob&s;erve, but continued to cha&s;e; I fired &s;everal Guns from Time to Time, until &s;he did ob&s;erve the Signal, and made the <HI>Defi|ance</HI>'s Signal, who continued to lay by the <HI>Tartan</HI> Prize, taking out the Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007865_0017_102DEBCF199CEE38">
<HI>At Ten,</HI></P>
<P>The cha&s;ing Ships appearing to be in a fair Way to rejoin the Fleet, I made the Signal to tack, and tacked to the South Ea&s;tward towards the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>At a Quarter after Ten,</HI></P>
<P>I made the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head, at the Di&s;tance of two Cables Length a&s;under, and about half an Hour pa&s;t Ten &s;quared my Main Top Sail, that the Ships &s;tationed a-head of me might the &s;ooner get into their Stations.</P>
<P><HI>About Ten Minutes after Eleven,</HI></P>
<P>I made the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head, at the Di&s;tance of half a Cables Length a&s;under; and immediately after the Ships &s;tati|oned a-head of me having got into their Stations, I made the Signal to fill, and &s;tand on, &s;et Topgallant Sails, and crowded Sail to gain the Wind of the Enemy, who at this Time were &s;tanding to the North We&s;tward in a Line of Battle a-head, and al&s;o crowding Sail.</P>
<P><HI>At half an Hour pa&s;t Twelve,</HI></P>
<P>The Wind then favouring us a Point or more, the Enemy took in their Topgallant-Sails, and their Van bore away, and formed their Line to leeward; probably becau&s;e their whole Line not being able to wea|ther us, they otherwi&s;e would have run the Ri&s;que of being &s;eparated, and their Line cut by our Line.</P>
<P><HI>About three Quarters after Twelve,</HI></P>
<P>Our Van headed the Enemy about the Di&s;tance of two Miles to windward, and as &s;oon as I headed them I kept away, the Wind nearly upon the Beam. The Enemy were twelve Ships in a &s;trait Line of Battle a-head, and five Frigates to leeward, at this Time laying with their Main Top Sails Square from the Wind al&s;o, and under Steerage Way.</P>
<P><HI>At One,</HI></P>
<P>Or a little after, the cha&s;ing Ships got into their Stations, and our Line appeared to be regularly clo&s;e, and well formed, the Enemy's Line more extended than ours.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before tacking I hauled up the Main Sail, and took in Top|gallant Sails, apprehending a Crowd of Sail inconvenient, and improper to pre&s;erve Order, or to engage with, and unnece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e the E|nemy appeared to be waiting for us under Top-Sails, their Main Top-Sails &s;quare.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007865_0018_102DEBD0C4DD77D8">
<HI>At half an Hour after One,</HI></P>
<P>Our Van then &s;tretched a little beyond the Enemy's Rear, to give room for leading down upon them, who having their Main Top-Sails Square, could not have fre&s;h Way; I made the Signal for the Fleet to tack altogether; and &s;oon after we tacked in that Manner, and kept in a Line on the other Tack.</P>
<P><HI>At Two,</HI></P>
<P>I made the Signal to lead to Starboard, with one Gun, and &s;oon after another Gun, to put the leading Captain in mind of his In&s;truc|tions, who I perceived did not &s;teer away with the Enemy's leading Ship, agreeable to the 19th Article of the fighting In&s;tructions, which directs. <Q>If the Admiral and his Fleet have the Wind of the Enemy, and they have &s;tretched them&s;elves in a Line of Battle, the Van of the Admiral's Fleet is to &s;teer with the Van of the Enemy's, and there to engage them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>About ten Minutes after Two,</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that the leading Ship did not &s;teer away &s;ufficiently, I bore away about two Points more than the Ships a-head of me; the Ships next a-head of me, bore down &s;oon after into their Stations a-head.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> appointed to repeat my Signals, ob|&s;erving that the <HI>Defiance,</HI> the leading Ship, did not comply properly with the Signal to lead to Starboard, repeated it &s;everal Times, in obedi|ence to an Article in his additional fighting In&s;tructions.</P>
<P><HI>(Viz.)</HI> <Q>If the Captains of the Frigates, which are appointed to repeat Signals, find the Signal not ob&s;erved, they are to fire Guns until it is taken notice of.</Q></P>
<P><HI>About Twenty Minutes after Two,</HI></P>
<P>It appeared to me, that the leading Ship did not &s;teer down &s;ufficient|ly, and by that Means, was drawing the Van a-brea&s;t of the Enemy's Van, and altering the Di&s;po&s;ition which I had made for attacking the Enemy, by &s;teering down a &s;lanting Cour&s;e to avoid being raked; I therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to make the Signal to engage, to bring on the Action, and to empower the Ships to fire re&s;pectively as they got within a proper Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Upon the Signal to engage, the leading Ship bore down more, as did the Van; in general; the <HI>Intrepid</HI> appeared to bear right down before the Wind, by which means &s;he was expo&s;ed to be raked, and was di&s;|abled by the Time &s;he could begin to fire or very &s;oon after; I al&s;o
<PB N="20" REF="007865_0019_102DEBD3CB94C860">
&s;teered away more, continuing the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head up, and with the Ships next a-head of me pre&s;erved a Line, and &s;teer|ed a proper &s;lanting Cour&s;e as the Circum&s;tances appeared to me, to fall in with and engage the Enemy, who I ob&s;erved had head-way.</P>
<P>The whole Van appeared to bear down more than the Rear Divi&s;ion, which I imagine mu&s;t have been owing to &s;ome Ships in the Van being extended at greater Di&s;tances from each other than in the Rear, and of con&s;equence being farther a-head with regard to the Enemy's Line, which laid them under a Nece&s;&s;ity of taking that Method to get into Action with the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>At half an hour after Two,</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy began to fire, all but the two &s;ternmo&s;t Ships, who re|&s;erved their Fire &s;ome little Time longer, but their Shot in general fell &s;hort throughout their Line.</P>
<P>About this Time I made the Signal for the <HI>Deptford</HI> to quit the Line, apprehending as &s;he was one of the weake&s;t Ships, that &s;he would be of the mo&s;t effectual Service as directed by that Signal. <HI>The fir&s;t Article of the additional fighting In&s;tructions, as given out to the Fleet by me at the Beginning of the Expedition. (Viz.)</HI> <Q>In Ca&s;e of meeting with a Squadron of the Enemy's Ships, that may be le&s;s in Number than the Squadron under my Command; if I would have any of the &s;malle&s;t Ships quit the Line, that tho&s;e of the greate&s;t Force may be oppo&s;ed to the Enemy; I will put abroad the Signal for &s;peaking with the Captain of any &s;uch Ship or Ships, as I would have leave the Line, and hoi&s;t a Flag &s;triped yellow and white on the Flag-&s;taff at the Fore Top Ma&s;t Head: Then the next Ships are to clo&s;e up the Line; and tho&s;e that have quitted the Line are to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t any Ship that may be di&s;abled or hard pre&s;s'd, or to take her Station if &s;he is obliged to go out of the Line: In which Ca&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t Ship that is withdrawn from the Line, is &s;trictly enjoined to &s;upply the Place, and fill up the Va|cancy.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after the Enemy began to fire, their Shot reached the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed through her Sails and Rigging; but I continued going down and re&s;erving my Fire until I could get clo&s;e to the Enemy, and I be|lieve declared &s;uch my Intention at that Time.</P>
<P><HI>About ten Minutes before three,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007865_0020_102DEBD5E7BD3BA8">
When the Enemy's Shot pa&s;&s;ed over the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> and through her Sails and Rigging, and &s;everal hulled her, &s;ome of the Seamen, as I have been informed &s;ince, out of impatience at receiving the Enemy's Fire without returning it, began to fire without Orders, as the Guns were kept pointed forwards on the Enemy in going down; others fol|lowed the Example, on a Suppo&s;ition that Orders were given.</P>
<P>I was di&s;plea&s;ed at firing &s;o &s;oon, contrary to my Intention, and I think expre&s;&s;ed my Di&s;&s;atisfaction; but being then within about half a Mile of the Enemy, with a fine Breeze; and apprehending that a very little Time would bring us down, and that it might prevent the Enemy from deliberately taking aim, and di&s;abling the Ship before coming to clo&s;e Action, I permitted the Fire to continue.</P>
<P>In the Time of firing, I think it was Lord <HI>Robert Bertie,</HI> who fir&s;t ob&s;erved it through the Smoke, and acquainted me, that one of our own Ships was clo&s;e upon the Lee Bow, and that there was danger of firing into her, I immediately gave orders not to fire without &s;eeing the Enemy's Colours, and to hale up the Fore Sail; and finding one Ship upon the Lee Bow, and another right a-head, both &s;o clo&s;e to us, with one or both Top-Sails a-back; I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity without He&s;i|tation of luffing the Ship up &s;o as to back the Top-Sails and avoid being immediately on Board of them.</P>
<P>And apprehending the Ships a-&s;tern, might run on Board of us as we lay in a Clu&s;ter, partly hid by the Smoke; I al&s;o immediately made the Signal for the Fleet to brace to, the Rear to brace to fir&s;t, and braced the Fore Top Sail &s;harp a-back, to back the <HI>Ramillies</HI> a-&s;tern, and ca&s;t her Head to Leeward of the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> and <HI>Tri|dent,</HI> in order for the more immediately making Sail a-head again.</P>
<P>On Account of the Danger of firing upon our own Ships, all firing cea&s;ed at this Time, on Board the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> after about four or five Broad&s;ides.</P>
<P>No Signal being appointed for the Rear only to brace to, laid me under a Nece&s;&s;ity, on this Emergency of making the general Signal to brace to, the Ships in the Rear to brace to fir&s;t; but this Signal was up &s;o &s;hort a Time, that the Rear Admiral who according to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Practice of the Navy, repeated all other Signals, could not if he &s;aw it, have time to repeat this, before it was haled down again, nor had Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> in the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> who was appointed to repeat my
<PB N="22" REF="007865_0021_102DEBD78F8E77B8">
Signals, time to repeat it; neither did any Ships a-head of me not brought to before, bring to in obedience to it; becau&s;e, apprehen&s;ive that the Ships a-head of me might bring to in Con&s;equence of this Signal, and intending that the Ships might fill which by bringing to had obliged me to lay a-back, I was very &s;olicitios to have the Signal made as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for the Fleet to fill and &s;tand on, the Ships in the Van to fill fir&s;t: And therefore,</P>
<P><HI>About fiften or twenty Minutes after Three,</HI></P>
<P>The Signal to brace to was haled down, while the <HI>Ramilies</HI>'s Top Sails were a-back, and the Signal made for the Fleet to fill and &s;tand on, the Ships in the Van to fill fir&s;t. This was as &s;oon as it could po&s;&s;ibly be made after the Signal to brace to, and did not exceed &s;ix or eight Minutes.</P>
<P>And having di&s;covered that the Stop was occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Revenge,</HI> and the Ships next a-head of me, bringing to or backing, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Intrepide;</HI> who at this Time appeared unable to carry Sail, having lo&s;t her Fore Top Ma&s;t, and her Fore Sail a-back; and that by this Means there was a Separation between the Rear Admiral's Di|vi&s;ion and mine, I made the Signal for the Rear to make more Sail, and clo&s;e the Line, almo&s;t at the &s;ame Time with the Signal to fill that the&s;e Ships might make Sail again and pa&s;s the <HI>Intrepide.</HI></P>
<P>The Smoke occa&s;ioned by the Fire from the Ships upon the Lee Bow, as well as what had proceeded from the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> ob&s;tructed my &s;eeing the Enemy's Conduct and Situation, about the Time of laying the Top Sails a-back. But the Smoke being cleared away, I ob&s;erved that the Enemy were then under Sail, Fore Sail and Top Sails edging down from the Wind, three or four Ships of their Van going large, and the &s;econd Ship from the Rear, which the Fire from the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was principally directed at, going quartering with her Fore Sail, Fore Top Sail and Fore Top Gallant Sail &s;ett, and her Main Top Sail Yard &s;hot down upon the Cap.</P>
<P><HI>At half an Hour after Three,</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Ramillies</HI> was backed a-&s;tern, and her Head ca&s;t to Lee|ward of the <HI>Trident</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a,</HI> I filled the Top Sails and &s;et the Fore Sail; and ob&s;erving that the &s;ternmo&s;t Ship of the Enemy was &s;eparated from their Line, by the Ship a-head of her having bore away, I &s;ent Lieutenant: <HI>Hamilton</HI> to Capt. <HI>Ward</HI> of the <HI>Culloden</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="007865_0022_102DEBDA03EEC660">
with Orders to make what Sail he could out of the Line, and en|deavour to cut her off.</P>
<P>Soon after this, &s;hooting a-head to Leeward of the <HI>Trident</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a,</HI> who were under their Top Sails, I ordered them to be hailed one after the other, as I &s;hot up with them to make more Sail, which they did; and I immediately &s;et my Main Sail, Jibb and Stay Sails.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI>'s Boat dropt on Board with a Letter from Captain <HI>Noel,</HI> acquainting me that he had lo&s;t a Leg, and de&s;iring that an Officer might be &s;ent to command the Ship. I immediately &s;ent Captain <HI>Gough,</HI> then my fir&s;t Lieutenant, with Di|rections, in his Way, to carry my Orders to Captain <HI>Amher&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Deptford,</HI> who was attending the <HI>Intrepide</HI> to take her Place in the Line; and I made the <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI>'s Signal to attend and a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>In|trepid</HI> then fallen a-&s;tern out of her Station in the Line.</P>
<P><HI>About Four,</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that the &s;ternmo&s;t Ship of the Enemy, had &s;hot up and joined their Line, the <HI>Culloden</HI> then abaft the lee Beam of the <HI>Ramil|lies,</HI> at the Di&s;tance of about two Cables Length with Topgallant Sails &s;et; I ordered Captain <HI>Ward</HI> to be hailed to get into his Station a|gain, judging it improper, then, to continue my Order for him to pur|&s;ue the &s;ternmo&s;t Ship of the Enemy, after &s;he had rejoined.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Centre and Rear continued &s;tretching a-head in a re|gular Line, and edging down to rejoin the Ships that had bore away, &s;ome of which the <HI>French</HI> Admiral fired &s;everal Shot at; and they &s;ome Time afterwards haled up and joined him; and I ob&s;erved that the <HI>French</HI> under Fore-&s;ail and Top-&s;ails very much out&s;ailed us, who had al&s;o Main-&s;ail, Jibb, and Stay-&s;ails &s;et. On this Occa&s;ion I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my Concern to Capt. <HI>Gardiner,</HI> that I had not a few more Ships to enable me to make the general Signal to cha&s;e.</P>
<P>None of the Enemy's Ships appeared unfit for Action, or had any vi&s;ible Damage in their Ma&s;ts or Yards, but the Ship that had her Main Top-&s;ail Yard &s;hot down by the Fire from the <HI>Ramillies.</HI></P>
<P>As they &s;tretched a-head and edged down to rejoin the Ships that had bore away, they exchanged Fire with our Van, but at a very con|&s;iderable Di&s;tance, and their Shot &s;eemed to fall &s;hort.</P>
<P>The Rear Admiral had lo&s;t his Main Top-&s;ail Yard; and &s;everal
<PB N="24" REF="007865_0023_102DEBDCAC9930C8">
Ships of the Van appeared too much &s;hattered to be able to pur&s;ue the Enemy; be&s;ides, the <HI>Intrepid</HI> totally di&s;abled and dropt at a con&s;idera|ble Di&s;tance a-&s;tern and to windward of the Fleet, with the <HI>Che&s;ter|field</HI> attending her.</P>
<P>After the Enemy bore away and made &s;ail, as they &s;o much out&s;ail|ed us, and a con&s;iderable Part of the Fleet was unable to pur&s;ue, I judged it improper to pur&s;ue with Part of the Fleet an Enemy &s;uperior at fir&s;t, and &s;till all of them fit for Action according to all Appearances.</P>
<P>And there appeared to me no further Po&s;&s;ibility of bringing the E|nemy to Action again as they declined it, without I had a &s;ufficient Force and Superiority to enable me to make the general Signal to chace; therefore I &s;tood on with my Divi&s;ion under Cour&s;es, Top|&s;ails, Jibb and Stay Sails, until we rejoined the Van Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>And at half an Hour after Five I made the Signal to bring to, and brought to in order to repair the Damages of &s;uch Ships as had &s;uffer|ed in the Action.</P>
<P>The Enemy were then upon the lee Bow, di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even Miles, continuing to &s;tand on to the northward, the Body of them &s;till pre&s;erving their Order; and being rejoined by the Ships that had bore away, they &s;eemed to be new forming their Line.</P>
<P><HI>About Six,</HI></P>
<P>Apprehending that the Enemy having ob&s;erved the Situation of our di&s;abled Ships, might take the Advantage, and tacking make an Attack in their Turn; I made the Signal for the Fleet to fill, and &s;oon after the Signal to tack, and the Ships appointed to lead on the larboard Tack to continue to lead on the &s;tarboard Tack, in order to cover the di&s;abled Ships, by placing my own Divi&s;ion that had &s;uffered lea&s;t in the Action in the Rear, and fir&s;t oppo&s;ed to the Enemy if they &s;hould make &s;uch an Attempt, and likewi&s;e prevent a farther Separation from the <HI>Intrepid</HI> and <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> at this Time about two Leagues upon the Weather Quarter of the Fleet.</P>
<P><HI>About Seven,</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that few of the headmo&s;t Ships were as yet tacked, and that tacking in the Order of Battle would take up much Time, as Night was coming on, and there was no Night Signal provided for Ships that led on the Larboard Tack to continue to lead on the Star|board Tack, I ordered the Signal for the Line to be hauled down, con|tinuing
<PB N="25" REF="007865_0024_102DEBDECE930888">
the Signal to tack up, that the whole Fleet might be able to tack before dark.</P>
<P>At the Clo&s;e of Day the Enemy were at the Di&s;tance of three or four Leagues to the northward, continuing to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>Soon after the Fleet was on the other Tack, I made the Night Sig|nal to bring to, and the Fleet continued to lay to all Night in the Place of Action.</P>
<P><HI>The 21&s;t,</HI></P>
<P>Moderate Weather, the latter Part light Airs of Wind and Calms, the Wind in the S. W. Quarter.&mdash;In the Morning the Enemy were &s;een in the N. W. Quarter from the Ma&s;t Heads of &s;ome of the Wea|thermo&s;t Ships.&mdash;The Fleet continued to lay to, the Ships which had received Damages in the Action employed in refitting.&mdash;The <HI>Intrepid</HI> and <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> having carried Sail all Night, and being out of Sight I ordered the <HI>Phoenix, Dolphin and Experiment</HI> to make Sail in dif|ferent Quarters to look for them.&mdash;At Noon Cape <HI>Mola</HI> was by our Reckoning N. W. half N. Di&s;tance about nine Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>The 22d,</HI></P>
<P>Light Airs of Wind, ea&s;terly and hazey Weather, the Fleet con|tinuing to lay to, the Ships that had received Damages employed in refitting.&mdash;I appointed Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> to command the <HI>Defiance</HI> in the room of Capt. <HI>Andrews</HI> killed in the Action.</P>
<P><HI>About Seven in the Morning,</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erving a Boat to the Windward of the Fleet, I &s;ent the Schooner to tow her down, which proved to be the <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI>'s long Boat cut adrift during the Action.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time I gave out a new Line of Battle, having chan|ged the Stations of &s;ome of the crippled Ships, and put two of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Captain,</HI> and <HI>Defiance</HI> in my own Divi&s;ion, and the <HI>Revenge</HI> and <HI>King&s;ton</HI> in the Rear Admiral's Divi&s;ion in their Places.</P>
<P><HI>About Nine,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> having made a Stretch to the Southward to fetch, in|to the Fleet, made the Signal for &s;eeing the <HI>Intrepid</HI> and <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> and &s;tood towards them in the S. W. Quarter.</P>
<P><HI>At Eleven,</HI></P>
<P>I made &s;ail with the Fleet towards them.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, upon Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s Repre&s;entation that the <HI>De|fiance</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="007865_0025_102DEBE0EF23C3A8">
was very weakly manned, and but few Seamen, I &s;ent a Mate from on board the <HI>Ramillies</HI> with thirty Seamen to a&s;&s;i&s;t in refitting her.</P>
<P><HI>At Eight in the Evening,</HI></P>
<P>Having joined the <HI>Intrepid</HI> and <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> I brought to with the Fleet, their Heads to the Northward.</P>
<P><HI>The 23d,</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of the Day, fre&s;h Gales from the ea&s;tward and hazey, the middle and latter Part moderate, &s;ometimes little Wind and Calms.</P>
<P>The Fleet laying to, the Ships that had received Damage in the Action refitting.</P>
<P>In the Morning I ordered the Officer of the Watch to view the Si|tuation of the crippled Ships as they appeared to him, and minute down the Particulars, and to give me a Copy of it, which he did as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> with her Fore-Yard and Fore-Topma&s;t down, no Main-Top-Gallant Ma&s;t up, and Main-top&s;ail Yard unrigged, laying a-cro&s;s upon the Cap, and the Sail unbent,</P>
<P>The <HI>Defiance,</HI> with her Main-Yard, and Fore-top-gallant Ma&s;t down, Main-top &s;ail furled, and Fore-top &s;ail double reefed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portland</HI> with her Fore Yard down, and Fore and Main-top &s;ails down upon the Cap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intrepid</HI> with jury-top Ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>I ordered Surveys on the Damages received by the crippled Ships in the late Action, and on their Stores; and gave Capt. <HI>Lloyd</HI> an Or|der to command the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> during Capt. <HI>Noel</HI>'s Illne&s;s, who had lo&s;t a Leg in the late Action; and Lieut. <HI>Gough</HI> an Order to com|mand the <HI>Che&s;terfield</HI> during Capt. <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>About Six in the Evening;</HI></P>
<P>Eight or Nine Sail of the Enemy were &s;een in the N. E. Ouarter; the Haze prevented our &s;eeing the whole, or di&s;cerning clearly how they &s;tood.</P>
<P>I ordered the Officer of the Watch to view the Situation of the lame Ships, and at the &s;ame Time to minute down the Particulars, and give me a Copy of it &s;igned, which he did as follows:</P>
<P>The <HI>Defiance</HI> with her Main and Fore Yards down, her Fore Top Ma&s;t &s;truck, and Main Top Sail furled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> with her Fore Yard and Top Ma&s;t down, and no Main Top-gallant Ma&s;t; her Main Top-&s;ail Yard unrigged, and lying a-cro&s;s upon the Cap, and the Sail unbent.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007865_0026_102DEBE2A491CD18">
The <HI>Portland</HI> with her Fore Yard down, and Fore and Main Top-&s;ails upon the Cap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intrepid</HI> with Jury Top Ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Ships of the Fleet in this Situation, did not appear to me as yet in a Condition fit to attack or receive the Enemy; and, therefore, after having con&s;ulted with the Rear Admiral upon that Head, about half an Hour after Seven I wore with the Fleet, and &s;tood under as ea&s;y Sail to the Southward for about four or five Miles.</P>
<P>The remaining Part of the Night, and next Morning it was calm.</P>
<P><HI>On the 24th,</HI></P>
<P>The Condition of the Fleet, and other Circum&s;tances, making it appear to me nece&s;&s;ary, and as it was agreeable to the Rear-Admiral's Opinion, I called a Council of War, the Subject of which, together with the Re&s;olutions, have been already laid before this Court.</P>
<P>What I have now laid before you, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge, Ob&s;ervation and Judgment, is a true Account of the Di&s;po&s;ition and Proceedings of his Maje&s;ty's Fleet during the &s;ix Days off <HI>Minorca,</HI> without any Exaggeration, fal&s;e colouring, or Concealment, of the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tance that can tend to give the Court any Information with Regard to the Proceedings of his Maje&s;ty's Fleet, or my own per|&s;onal Conduct; nor am I con&s;cious of having in a &s;ingle In&s;tance &s;a|crificed Truth to Safety.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Part of this Narrative, if not the whole, has been pro|ved, I hope, to the Satisfaction of this Court already; and, I pre&s;ume, will appear con&s;i&s;tent with, and a proper Execution of my Duty, con|formable to the Rules of Prudence, the Art of War, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Di&s;cipline of the Navy. But I mu&s;t here beg Leave to remark a|gain, that &s;hould any other Di&s;po&s;ition for attacking the Enemy be thought more advantageous than that I made, yet it cannot come with|in the Limits of my Charge. For &s;hould a Charge, depending upon Judgment in making the Di&s;po&s;ition, be brought again&s;t a Commander in Chief&mdash;I believe I may venture to affirm, that &s;hould &s;uch Di&s;ci|pline be once e&s;tabli&s;hed, no Officer can be &s;afe in taking upon him the Command of a Fleet.&mdash;It is evident, next to a Demon&s;tration, there never yet was a Di&s;po&s;ition for a Battle, either by Sea of Land, made by any Commanding Officer, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or un&s;ucce&s;sful, which being minutely canva&s;&s;ed and examined, would not admit of &s;ome Amendment.</P>

<P>I HAVE received and communicated to my Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Admiralty</HI> your Letter of the 6th In&s;tant, inclo&s;ing a further Li&s;t of Witne&s;&s;es which you de&s;ire may be &s;ent for from the <HI>Mediter|ranean,</HI> being Officers in his Maje&s;ty's Fleet there; and in return thereto am commanded by their Lord&s;hips to acquaint you, that as you lie under an Imputation of Misbehaviour, by means whereof the Honour and Intere&s;t of this Kingdom hath &s;uffered in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Manner, and &s;tand committed to the Mar&s;hal of the High Court of Admiralty to an&s;wer for the &s;ame; their Lord&s;hips were de&s;irous, in Ju&s;tice to the Publick as well as Tenderne&s;s to your&s;elf, to give you the earlie&s;t Opportunity of acquitting your&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, from &s;o heavy a Charge; and therefore directed me, as appears by my Let|ter of the 31&s;t of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, to give you an Intimation of their Inten|tion to bring you to your Trial; their Lord&s;hips hoped, as there were then in <HI>England</HI> no fewer than twenty Officers who had &s;erved on board the Fleet under your Command; not one of whom had come or been &s;ent for, upon the lea&s;t Intimation or Knowledge of what Evi|dence
<PB N="30" REF="007865_0029_102DEBE9DACAEEB8">
he could give upon the Occa&s;ion; and as among&s;t them were &s;e|veral who mu&s;t be pre&s;umed under a particular Bias (as far as Truth will permit) in your Favour, their Lord&s;hips thought you would have con&s;i|dered this Number of Officers of all Ranks, from different Parts of the Fleet, who from various Accidents had happened to come over, &s;ufficient to clear up the Matter according to the Truth and Ju&s;tice of the Ca&s;e; and have de&s;ired an immediate Trial upon the Evidence now in <HI>England;</HI> but by your Letter of the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> you &s;ent a Li&s;t of thirty &s;even Witne&s;&s;es as nece&s;&s;ary to your Defence, twenty three of whom were then in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> their Lord&s;hips, tho' greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the Number required, and well &s;atisfied that they could not all be nece&s;&s;ary; yet notwith&s;tanding the Detriment which mu&s;t ari&s;e to the public Service, by calling &s;o many Per&s;ons home from the Fleet at this Time, and the long Delay of your Trial oc|ca&s;ioned thereby, they ordered me to acquaint you, by my Letter of the 12th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that all the Sea-Officers you had de&s;ired might be &s;ent for, were ordered to be brought home in his Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Colche&s;ter;</HI> and that their Lord&s;hips had applied to the King for Leave for all the Land-Officers you had de&s;ired, to come at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances they cannot help expre&s;&s;ing their A&s;toni&s;h|ment at your Application of the 6th In&s;tant, with a new Li&s;t of no fewer than 31 Officers to be &s;ent for, without the lea&s;t Fact, Proof, or even Allegation to &s;upport this Reque&s;t, or to excu&s;e it's not being made before; their Lord&s;hips look upon it merely as a Scheme &s;ug|gue&s;ted to you to delay your being brought to a Trial, which mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, if your Application &s;hould be complied with; by the &s;ame Means you may put off your Trial for ever; it is but applying for a new Li&s;t every Month or &s;ix Weeks, and at la&s;t con|cluding with a De&s;ire that the whole Fleet may be brought home. Ju&s;|tice to a Per&s;on accu&s;ed who may be innocent, requires that he &s;hould have a rea&s;onable Opportunity of making and proving his Defence; this you have already had to the utmo&s;t of your own De&s;ire, and been indulged to &s;o great an Extent as may make an Example very danger|ous to the Service and Di&s;cipline of the Navy; but Ju&s;tice to the Pub|lic requires that a Per&s;on accu&s;ed, who certainly may be guilty, &s;hould not under the bare Pretence of de&s;iring Means of Defence make his Trial ab&s;olutely impracticable.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="007865_0030_102DEBEBFAAE1070">
I am therefore commanded by their Lord&s;hips to acquaint you, that &s;o &s;oon as the Witne&s;&s;es already &s;ent for &s;hall come over, they intend to bring on your Trial, which they &s;ee no Rea&s;on to po&s;tpone any lon|ger, barely on Account of the new Application made by your afore|&s;aid Letter of the 6th In&s;tant, and that you have laid no Grounds be|fore their Lord&s;hips &s;ufficient to induce them to give the lea&s;t Coun|tenance to &s;o extraordinary an Attempt.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Greenwich-Ho&s;pital,</HI> <DATE><HI>September 14, 1756.</HI></DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received your Letter of the 9th In&s;tant, in which your Manner of rea&s;oning &s;eems very extraordinary. I &s;hall not comment upon that prejudging Expre&s;&s;ion of yours, <Q>an Opportunity of acquitting my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible,</Q> it &s;eems &s;ufficiently to explain it&s;elf; but I cannot pa&s;s by unnoticed your <Q>pre&s;uming &s;everal of the Witne&s;&s;es now in <HI>England</HI> having a particular Bia&s;s, as far as Truth will per|mit in my Favour.</Q> Whence &s;hould that Bia&s;s ari&s;e? If from the Hopes of Reward, or Fear of Puni&s;hment: Rewards and Puni&s;hments are certainly in other Hands than mine.</P>
<P>And how great is my A&s;toni&s;hment at your mentioning their Lord|&s;hips Tenderne&s;s to me, and their Indulgence! Phra&s;es I did not ex|pect to meet with. Can being kept moving backward and forward from one Place of Confinement to another, for near three Weeks after my Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o as to make it impo&s;&s;ible for me to prepare any Thing relating to my Defence, be called by either of the&s;e Names? Or can my clo&s;e Confinement at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> without &s;uffering even my menial Servants to remain in the Hou&s;e after Dark, be called &s;o? And I think I have a Right to complain of that Cruel Countenance and Belief, which &s;eems to be given to a groundle&s;s Report, of my having attempted to make my E&s;cape, and the rigid Orders given in Con&s;equence of it, as if intented to confirm it; a Report &s;o injurious to me, and &s;o ab&s;olutely without Foundation; from which the Mar|&s;hal and Officers who have commanded the Guards here, as well as every private Centinal can fully vindicate me&mdash;And I cannot here
<PB N="32" REF="007865_0031_102DEBEE9A28DE70">
avoid ob&s;erving, that all Charge of keeping me in Cu&s;tody &s;eems to be taken from the Mar&s;hal, and committed to the Governor of the Ho&s;|pital, by the Orders given in his Name, who &s;eems diligent in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf in the Service of his Country, by impo&s;ing upon me all the Indignities and Inconveniences that Power can enable him to do.</P>
<P>Had their Lord&s;hips, as you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, intended me the earlie&s;t Opportunity of acquitting my&s;elf, it is very difficult to conceive why they were not plea&s;ed to communicate their Intentions of bringing me to a Trial, at the &s;ame Time, that I received their Orders to &s;trike my Flag, and re&s;ign the Command of the Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to Sir <HI>Edward Hawke;</HI> that would have been doing me Ju&s;tice, in giving me an Opportunity of con&s;idering my Conduct, and the Proof nece&s;&s;ary to be given in &s;upport of it, at a Time when no con&s;cious Guilt or Mi&s;conduct &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that I was to be arre&s;ted upon my Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> clo&s;ely confined, and then brought to Trial; for &s;urely no Per&s;on was to &s;uppo&s;e that I was to look upon an Ex|tract of an Enemy's Letter, and that Extract (if from a genuine Letter) a mere Ga&s;conade and ab&s;olute Fal&s;hood, as &s;ufficient to ground a Charge again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve again, that in my Letter of the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> I mentioned particularly the Names of all that occurred to me then; nor is it Matter of Wonder that I could not at once think of all the Wit|ne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for my Defence. It would rather be Matter of Won|der, re&s;trained and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by all the Methods Power can impo&s;e, and per&s;onally di&s;turbed Day and Night, if I had Immediately thought of all the Witne&s;&s;es, or a &s;ufficient Number capable of giving Te&s;timony in my Behalf. But &s;urely it can be no Cau&s;e of A&s;toni&s;hment, that accu&s;ed of Crimes of the highe&s;t Nature, and con&s;cious of my own In|nocence, I &s;hould be de&s;irous of producing all &s;uch Witne&s;&s;es as appear to me nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly know for what Purpo&s;e any of the Officers now in <HI>England</HI> came home; and therefore could have no Idea, that they were con&s;idered as the Witne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for my Defence. But if it was known to their Lord&s;hips, that the&s;e Gen|tlemen came to <HI>England</HI> in order to prove me guilty of Mi&s;conduct, certainly I &s;hould have had the earlie&s;t Opportunity of bringing home my Witne&s;&s;es. And if I had de&s;ired an immediate Trial upon my Ar|rival
<PB N="33" REF="007865_0032_102DEBF0EF954A28">
in <HI>England,</HI> as your Letter &s;eems to intimate, I mu&s;t have de|&s;ired it before I knew of any Charge, and without Witne&s;&s;es to pro|duce in my Defence.</P>
<P>What Fact, Proof, or Allegation their Lord&s;hips expected from me in &s;upport of my Reque&s;t, is not ea&s;y to conceive; can any &s;tronger be requi&s;ite, than that they are nece&s;&s;ary Witne&s;&s;es, and a Li&s;t given within a rea&s;onable Time, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, and at a Time when there is proper Opportunity of &s;ending for them, and of &s;ending other Officers to &s;upply their Places.&mdash;Giving in an additional Li&s;t of Witne&s;&s;es is not unprecedented, and the greater the Number examined, the more con&s;picuous mu&s;t Guilt or Innocence appear. The Rea&s;on of their not being reque&s;ted, or occurring to me as nece&s;&s;ary &s;ooner, is ea&s;ily deduced from the unparallel'd Treatment and unprecedented Hard&s;hips, and Inconveniences that I have had to &s;truggle with.</P>
<P>Far from delaying or attempting to render my Trial impracticable, I do a&s;&s;ure you their Lord&s;hips cannot be more eager and &s;ollicitous to have me brought to Trial than I am; but a Trial without the nece&s;&s;ary Witne&s;&s;es cannot be con&s;idered as any Trial at all; rather an Act of Power than an Act of Ju&s;tice; and mu&s;t be a Precedent much more dangerous than that hinted at in your Letter; and I cannot re&s;ign my ju&s;t and legal Claim to call upon Witne&s;&s;es that are nece&s;&s;ary to vindi|cate my Conduct, and make the Truth evident.</P>

<P>Ju&s;tice to my&s;elf demands, and I hope will be thought a &s;ufficient Apology, for that Freedom and Plainne&s;s becoming a Man in my Cir|cum&s;tances.&mdash;It is far from my Purpo&s;e to endeavour fixing any Blame or Imputation, even on my greate&s;t Enemies, without Rea&s;on. But the Indignation and Re&s;entment of an incen&s;ed Nation, is a Load much too heavy for me to bear, though it has been my Misfortune to &s;truggle under it &s;o long. And therefore I mu&s;t entreat the Court to forgive my taking up &s;ome Part of their Time, in proving what may at fir&s;t View &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary by the Nature of my Charge: That I may vindicate my Conduct to an incen&s;ed and deluded Nation, taught hi|therto to look upon me as a principal Cau&s;e of the Publick's Misfor|tune,
<PB N="34" REF="007865_0033_102DEBF299080908">
and as a Man guilty of the mo&s;t odious of all military, and mo&s;t contemptible of all civil Crimes.</P>
<P>No Symptom of Cowardice, that odious and capital Part of my Charge has hitherto appeared to the Court; and my Innocence, and con&s;cious Di&s;charge of my Duty, makes me confident that none will appear. Yet have I already &s;uffered the &s;evere&s;t Penalties that can be inflicted on it, being hung up in Effigy, traduced by Libels, tortured by Mi&s;repre&s;entations and Calumny, di&s;graced and &s;uper&s;eded, upon no better Authority than the Ga&s;conade of the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, arre&s;|ted and confined beyond the Example of former Times, treated like a Felon with every Indignity, and my Life pur&s;ued with the mo&s;t inve|terate Malice. But all this I have had Fortitude enough to de&s;pi&s;e, and treat with the Contempt it de&s;erves, the Re&s;ult of a Con&s;cience clear of all Crimes.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now beg Leave to lay before the Court the Orders for di&s;|charging the Marines, and for embarking Ld. <HI>Robert Bertie</HI>'s Regi|ment, which la&s;t points out the De&s;tination and Service intended for his Lord&s;hip's Regiment; and al&s;o &s;ome Letters of Intelligence relating to the Enemy's Embarkation, Force of their Fleet, Reinforcement ex|pected, and other Particulars.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not tre&s;pa&s;s any longer on the Patience of the Court, having nothing farther to add, be&s;ides &s;ome Ob&s;ervations hereafter on the Evi|dence, if the remaining Time will admit of it. But I fear it will re|quire a much longer Time then I &s;hall have to do it in, and a much abler hand than mine to di&s;cu&s;s and dige&s;t Minutes of &s;uch a Nature, and of &s;o great a Length: Therefore relying on the Candour and Abi|lity of my Judges, as my only and proper Council, I mu&s;t beg that they will be plea&s;ed to allow for my Defects and Omi&s;&s;ions, and &s;upply my want of more proper Talents to explain and &s;upport my Innocence.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, January 26, 1757.</HI></P>
<P>THE Court having now heard the Evidence on both Sides, toge|ther with the Pri&s;oner's Defence, and very maturely and tho|roughly con&s;idered the &s;ame, they unanimou&s;ly came to the following Thirty &s;ix Re&s;olutions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It does not appear, that any unnece&s;&s;ary Delay was made by Admiral Byng, in the Proceedings of the Squadron under his
<PB N="35" REF="007865_0034_102DEBF56423D8A8">
Command, from the Time of their Sailing, from <HI>St. Holens,</HI> on the 6th of <HI>April,</HI> to the Time of their Arrival off <HI>Minorca</HI> on the 19th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That upon the Fleet's getting Sight of <HI>Minorca,</HI> on the Morning of the 19th of <HI>May;</HI> the Admiral detached three Frigates, (the <HI>Phoenix, Che&s;terfield,</HI> and <HI>Dolphin</HI>) a-head, with Orders to Capt. <HI>Hervey</HI> of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> to endeavour to land a Letter from the Admiral to Lieutenant General <HI>Blakeney,</HI> and to make Ob&s;er|vations of what Batteries or Forts the Enemy might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of along the Shore.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That tho&s;e Frigates got a-head of the Fleet, and in Shore, and the <HI>Phoenix</HI> clo&s;e to the Lair of <HI>Mahan,</HI> and were endevouring to execute tho&s;e Orders till they were called off between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock, by Signal from the Admiral, upon Di&s;covery of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet in the South-Ea&s;t Quarter.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That the Fleet &s;tood towards the Enemy the remaining Part of the Day, with Calms and little Winds, till they tackt in the Evening.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> The Court are of opinion, That the Admiral pro|ceeded properly, upon Di&s;covery of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, to &s;tand towards them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That Major General <HI>Stuart,</HI> Lord <HI>Ef|fingham,</HI> and Col. <HI>Cornwallis,</HI> with about Thirty Officers, and &s;ome Recruits, amounting in the Whole to about One Hundred, belonging to the different Regiments in Garri&s;on at <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s, were on board Ships of the Squadron.</P>
<P N="7">7. 12 <HI>Yeas, for all the Officers, I, for the General and Field Officers only.</HI></P>
<P>The Court are of Opi|nion, That as &s;o great a Number, of Officers were on board the Fleet, belonging to the Garri&s;on of <HI>St. Philip</HI>'s, where they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be much wanted, the Admiral ought to have put them on board one of the Frigates he &s;ent a-head, in order to have been land|ed, if found practicable; and if not landed before he &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, he ought to have left the Frigate to have endeavoured to land them, notwith&s;tanding he did &s;ee the Enemy's Fleet.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That from the Time of fir&s;t &s;eeing the <HI>French</HI> Fleet in the Morning of the 19th of <HI>May,</HI> till our Fleet weathered the <HI>French,</HI> about Noon of the 20th, the Admiral took proper
<PB N="36" REF="007865_0035_102DEBF8128B6408">
Mea&s;ures to gain and keep the Wind of the Enemy, and to form and clo&s;e the Line of Battle.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That the Van of our Fleet upon the Starboard Tack, &s;tretched beyond the Rear of the Enemy's Fleet, and that our whole Fleet then tackt all together, by Signal; the Enemy's Fleet lying at the &s;ame Time to Leeward, in a Line of Battle a-head, on the Laboard Tack, under their Top&s;ails, with their Main-top &s;ails &s;quare.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That immediately after our Fleet was about upon the Larboard Tack, our Rear was con&s;iderably farther to Windward of the Enemy's Rear, than our Van was of their Van.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> The Court are of Opinion, That when the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet, on the Starboard Tack were &s;tretched abrea&s;t, or about the Beam of the Enemy's Line, the Admiral &s;hould have tacked all together, and immediately have conducted it on a direct Cour&s;e for the Enemy; the Van &s;teering for the Enemy's Van, the Rear for their Rear, each Ship for her oppo&s;ite Ship in the Enemy's Line, and under &s;uch a Sail as might have enabled the wor&s;t &s;ailing Ship, under all her plain Sail, to pre&s;erve her Station.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That &s;oon after the Fleet were upon the Larboard-Tack, the Admiral made Signals for leading two Points to Starboard, which brought the Wind upon or abaft the Beam; and the Ships continued that Cour&s;e, nearly ahead of each other, till the Ad|miral made the Signal for Battle.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, that the Admiral made the Signal for, Battle, about Twenty Minutes after Two o'Clock.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That at the Time the Signal was made for Battle, the <HI>French</HI> Fleet were &s;till lying to Leeward, with their Main-top-&s;ails &s;quare, as before-mentioned, and that our Van was con|&s;iderably nearer to their Van, than our Rear was to their Rear.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That upon the Signal being made for Battle, the Ships of our Van Divi&s;ion; bore down properly, for the Ships oppo&s;ed to them in the Enemy's Line, and engaged them, till the five headmo&s;t Ships of the Enemy, went away to Leeward, out of Gun Shot.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That the &s;ternmo&s;t Ship of our Van Divi&s;ion, the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> having hauled up, and engaged about ten Mi|nutes, or a Quarter of an Hour, lo&s;t her Fore-top-ma&s;t, a little before Three o'Clock.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="37" REF="007865_0036_102DEBF9C5CCA650">
17. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That the <HI>Revenge,</HI> the headmo&s;t Ship of the Rear Divi&s;ion, bore down for the Ship oppo&s;ed to her in the Enemy's Line, and that &s;he brought up upon the Weather-Quarter of the <HI>Intripid,</HI> upon the <HI>Intripid</HI>'s Foretop-ma&s;t going away; and that &s;he quickly afterwards, upon the <HI>Intripid</HI>'s &s;etting her Fore-&s;ail, bore down under the <HI>Intripid</HI>'s Lee-Quarter, and brought up there.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That upon the Signal being made for Battle, and the Van putting before the Wind, the Admiral in the <HI>Ra|milies,</HI> edged away &s;ome Points, and the <HI>Trident</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> thereby becoming to Windward of him, the Admiral thereupon hauled up his Fore-&s;ail, backed his Mizen-top-&s;ails and endeavoured to back his Main-top-&s;ail, to allow of their getting into their Stations, and con|tinued in that Situation for five, &s;ix, or &s;even Minutes.</P>
<P N="19">19. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It is the Opinion of the Court, that the Admiral, after the Signal was made for Battle, &s;eparated the Rear from the Van Divi&s;ion, and retarded the Rear Divi&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fleet from clo|&s;ing with, and engaging the Enemy, by his &s;hortening Sail, by hauling up his Fore-&s;ail, backing his Mizen-top-&s;ail, and backing, or attempt|ing to back his Main-top-&s;ail, in order that the <HI>Trident</HI> and <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a,</HI> might get a-head again of the <HI>Ramilies.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It is the Opinion of the Court, That in&s;tead of &s;hortening Sail, the Admiral ought to have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> the <HI>Trident</HI>'s and <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI>'s Signals to make more Sail; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> that he ought al&s;o to have &s;et &s;o much Sail him&s;elf, as would have enabled the <HI>Culloden</HI> (the wor&s;t &s;ailing Ship in his Divi&s;ion) to have kept her Station with all her Plain Sail &s;et, in order to have got down with as much Expedition as po&s;&s;ible, to the Enemy; and thereby, have properly &s;upported the Van Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That the Admiral, after &s;hortening Sail, as beforementioned, again &s;et his Fore-&s;ail, and filled his Top-&s;ails, and &s;teered with the Wind abaft the Beam, a &s;lanting Cour&s;e towards the Enemy, under that Sail, 'till about Three o'Clock; when the Peo|ple in the <HI>Ramilies,</HI> began to fire without Orders, at too great a Di&s;|tance for engageing; but the Firing was continued by the Admiral's Directions.</P>
<P N="22">22. <HI>Unanimou&s;ly.</HI> It appears, That &s;ome little Time before this Firing began in the <HI>Ramillies,</HI> the <HI>Prince&s;s Loui&s;a</HI> was &s;een from the

<P><HI>Notwith&s;tanding which, and the many Petitions pre&s;ented in Behalf of the Admiral, by his Nephew</HI> George <HI>Lord Vi&s;count</HI> Torrington, <HI>and others, a Warrant was i&s;&s;ued the 16th Day of</HI> February, <HI>for his Execution to be on the 28th: But ina&s;much as his Maje&s;ty was in|formed, that a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who was a Mem|ber of the Court-Martial, which tried the &s;aid Admiral, had, in his Place, applied to the Hou&s;e, in Behalf of him&s;elf, and &s;everal other Members of the &s;aid Court, praying the Aid of Parliament to be re|lea&s;ed from the Oath of Secrecy impo&s;od on Courts-Martial, in order to di&s;clo&s;e the Grounds whereon Sentence of Death pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;aid Admiral, the Re&s;ult of which Di&s;covery, might &s;hew the Sentence to be improper;&mdash;His Maje&s;ty had thought fit to re&s;pite the Execution of the &s;ame, until the 14th of</HI> March, <HI>in order that there might be an Opportunity of knowing by the &s;eparate Examination of the Mem|bers of the &s;aid Court, upon Oath, what Ground there was for the Sugge&s;tion of his Sentence being improper.</HI></P>

<P>In Con&s;equence of which, the &s;aid Court-Martial were ordered to attend the Hou&s;e of Lords, and were examined &s;eparately; and as there was but three out of the Thirteen that de&s;ired the Act to pa&s;s, the other Ten being &s;atisfied that the Verdict they had given, did not proceed from any Influence, but was from the Integrity of their Hearts, the only Verdict they could give; the Bill was unanimou&s;ly thrown out of that Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e.

<OPENER><DATELINE>GREENWICH-HOSPITAL, <DATE><HI>Oct. 17. 1756.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I Have received your Letter of the 14th In&s;tant, informing me that his Maje&s;ty's Ship</HI> Colche&s;ter, <HI>is on her Return Home with the Witne&s;&s;es de&s;ired by my Letter of the 4th of</HI> Augu&s;t <HI>la&s;t, and cannot help ex|pre&s;&s;ing Surprize at their Lord&s;hips not having thought proper, &s;ooner, nor even now to take Notice of my Letter, dated the 14th of</HI> September, <HI>wherein, in An&s;wer to yours of the 9th, I gave farther explanatory Rea|&s;ons for reque&s;ting and claiming nece&s;&s;ary Evidences, a List of whom I &s;ent with my Letter of the 6th of the &s;ame Month.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Ca&s;e is very &s;ufficiently hard, if indulged with every legal Advan|tage; for I have too much Rea&s;on to believe my Pro&s;ecution is carried on by Per&s;ons, too powerful for me to contend again&s;t, who&s;e Influence</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="007865_0041_102DEC04642D94D8">
<HI>mu&s;t add great Weight to their Accu&s;a&s;ions again&s;t me. In &s;uch a Situa|tion their Lord&s;hips will forgive my in&s;i&s;ting upon the Right of every common Subject, and that I may not be deprived of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ingle Witne&s;s that I think nece&s;&s;ary for my Defence. It may perhaps be attended with Inconveniencies (as is alledged to put off my Trial;) but no Inconvenience can equal the Cruelty and Inju&s;tice in bringing a Man to his Trial upon Life and Death, who is denied the common Means of De|fence; nor &s;hould their Lord&s;hips be much &s;urprized that I made this Re|que&s;t no earlier than the 6th of</HI> September, <HI>for if they con&s;ider my Situ|ation, when I gave in my fir&s;t List under clo&s;e Confinement, without the Opportunity of con&s;ulting Friends or Council, and almo&s;t ignorant of the Charge again&s;t me, they will rather wonder I was able at that Juncture, to do &s;o much, than that I did no more.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If their Lord&s;hips had thought proper to curtail the Li&s;t of Evidence, for any Rea&s;ons what&s;oever, which I pre&s;ume they have no Right to do; yet if my Charge regards my per&s;onal Conduct, &s;urely they cannot with any Appearance of Ju&s;tice or Impartiality deny me tho&s;e Witne&s;&s;es from the</HI> Ramillies, <HI>who were &s;o near Eye-Witne&s;&s;es to my Conduct: I cannot with|draw my Claim to them; and therefore again &s;end you annexed to this, the List of Witne&s;&s;es wherein tho&s;e who were on Board the</HI> Ramillies <HI>are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t al&s;o repeat again, that a Trial without the nece&s;&s;ary Witne&s;&s;es, cannot be deemed an Act of Ju&s;tice, but an Act of over-bearing Power, and, as &s;uch, prote&s;t again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a Per&s;on confined, oppre&s;&s;ed and calumni|ated, as I am, can po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;irous of po&s;tponing his Trial; but I mu&s;t continue to de&s;ire to in&s;i&s;t upon what I have a natural and legal Right to,</HI> JUSTICE, <HI>and as an E&s;&s;ential to it, the Witne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to my Defence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t de&s;ire your An&s;wer, &s;ignifying their Lord&s;hips Intentions, and am,</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon which Letter, a Writer to the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> makes this Ob&s;ervation, too material, he &s;ays, to be omitted, as it is a &s;uffici|ent An&s;wer to the principal Grievance complained of by, Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> and his Advocates, I mean, the Denial of the &s;econd Li&s;t of, Evidence, e&s;|pecially <HI>tho&s;e Witne&s;&s;es from the</HI> Ramillies, <HI>who were &s;o near Eye-Wit|ne&s;&s;es to his Conduct, which be declared could not be denied him with any</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="007865_0042_102DC729181E83C8">
<HI>Appearance of Ju&s;tice or Impartiality,</HI> and to which <HI>he could not with|draw his Claim.</HI> If after this, on the Arrival of the <HI>Ramillies</HI> at <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> during Mr. <HI>Byng</HI>'s Trial, when the-Pre&s;ident of the Court-Mar|tial acquainted him, that he might call any Witne&s;&s;es on board her, it appears, as I am a&s;&s;ured, that he declined doing it, with what View can one imagine this Application was made, and what becomes of the In|vectives founded on the Refu&s;al?</P>
<P>Various are the Arguments that have been offered to vindicate the Admiral's Conduct on this memorable Occa&s;ion; and it mu&s;t be allow|ed, they are very plau&s;ible. The Witne&s;&s;es in general acquitted him of Delay, from his Departure from St. <HI>Helen</HI>'s till he came before <HI>Mahon.</HI> His Precautions in &s;ending three Frigates a-head to recon|noitre the Harbour, and his calling them off on the Appearance of the Enemy, &s;eems founded on Rea&s;on. It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be allowed, that his di&s;embarking his Soldiers for the Reinforcement of the Garri&s;on, before the Battle, would have been impolitick, as it would have weak|ened his Fleet, and made him le&s;s capable of encountering the Enemy. Nor is it le&s;s certain, that the &s;ew Land Forces he had on Board were in&s;ufficient to &s;ave the Citadel, much le&s;s the I&s;land. All this is grant|ed: But let it be ob&s;erved too, that the Admiral will never be made to &s;uffer for that which was not in his Power to perform; and indeed his Advocates have not &s;o much as touched upon the principal Part of the Charge again&s;t him, and of which be was found Guilty; namely, that he did not do his utmo&s;t to relieve St. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Ca&s;tle; that during the Engagement, he did not do his utmo&s;t to take, &s;eize, and de&s;troy the Enemy's Ships; nor did a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Ships in the Action, as he ought to have done.</P>
<P>Now, though it might be prudent in the Admiral not to weaken his Fleet, by &s;ending away his Soldiers and Marines, for Relief of the Gar|ri&s;on, before the Engagement, yet what hindered him afterwards, when the <HI>French</HI> fled, and did not return to renew the Fight in four Days that he &s;taid there. That a De&s;cent was practicable, was &s;ufficiently proved by Lord <HI>Blakeney</HI> and Mr. <HI>Boyd.</HI> But not a Word of this in his Defence.</P>
<P>That he did not do his utmo&s;t to take, &s;eize, and de&s;troy the Enemy's Ships, is proved by the concurring Evidence of mo&s;t of the Captains in the Fleet, who unanimou&s;ly agree, that if he had &s;et up more Sail, he
<PB N="44" REF="007865_0043_102DEC0854DE8B68">
might as ea&s;ily have gone down to the Enemy as did the Van. Why then did he not? Why did he throw his Sails a-back, and thereby &s;top his going down? Becau&s;e, &s;ay his Advocates, he was then engaged with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Ships, Yet Capt. <HI>Young,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ward,</HI> and others were of Opinions, that had the Admiral gone down with his Divi&s;ion, he would not only have prevented the Damage that was done the Van by the &s;uperior Fire of the Enemy, but in all Probability would have gained a complete Victory.</P>
<P>Nor did he a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Ships in Di&s;tre&s;s, as it was his Duty to have done. This was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Intrepid,</HI> who, had &s;he not been relieved by Capt. <HI>Cornwall,</HI> mu&s;t, in all Likelihood, have gone to the Bottom, or been taken by the Enemy; for no Signal was made by the Admiral, for removing her out of the Line, or for any other Ship to go to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that the Condemnation of the Admiral was founded upon good Proof and &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons. And though the Court acquitted him of Cowardice and Di&s;affection, yet his Neglects were &s;uch a notorious Breach of the 12th Article of War, that it &s;eemed not in their Power, unle&s;s they would &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the cleare&s;t Evidence, to pa&s;s any other Sentence upon him than what they did.</P>
<P>When the Admiral was ordered into Court to receive his Sentence, he went with his Friend Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> and in &s;uch full Expectation of being acquitted, that they had agreed to dine together. When they came on Board the <HI>St. George,</HI> one of the Court-Martial beckon'd the Gentleman a&s;ide, and told him, That as he believed the Admiral ex|pected to be acquitted, he thought it might &s;hock him le&s;s, to be ac|quainted before he went in, that his Sentence would be Death. On his Friend's coming back to him, and looking di&s;order'd, the Admiral a&s;k'd him, with &s;ome Warmth, <Q>What is the Matter? Have they thrown a Slur upon me?</Q> <Q>Sir, &s;aid his Friend, it is wor&s;e; your Sentence will be Death!</Q> After a &s;hort Pau&s;e, he an&s;wered, <Q>Well, if my Death will appea&s;e the Clamours of the People, in God's Name let them have it.</Q></P>
<P>The Admiral heard his Sentence pronounc'd with great Compo&s;ure; and as &s;oon as it was fini&s;h'd, retir'd, without Reply, to his Confine|ment on Shore, where a double Guard was &s;et over him; but he was
<PB N="45" REF="007865_0044_102DEC0A77D54238">
&s;oon after remov'd on Board the <HI>Monarque,</HI> where he was confin'd under a Captain's Guard.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Affairs of his Trial, while the Admiral was pre|paring for his Di&s;&s;olution; and the following Letter from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> &s;hews the Manner of his Execution.</P>

<P>ORDERS being given for all the Men of War at <HI>Spithead,</HI> to &s;end their Boats on Monday Morning, the 14th of <HI>March,</HI> with the Captain, and all the Officers of each Ship, accompanied by a Party of Marines in each Boat, under Arms, to attend the Execution of Mr, <HI>Byng;</HI> they, in Pur&s;uance of that Order, rowed from <HI>Spithead,</HI> and made the Harbour a little after Eleven o'Clock, with the utmo&s;t Difficulty and Danger, it blowing a prodigious hard Gale, the Wind at W. N. W. and ebbing Water, it was the more difficult to get up &s;o high as the <HI>Monarque</HI> lay, on board which Ship the Admiral &s;uffered. Notwith&s;tanding it blew &s;o hard, and the Sea ran very high, and with great Violence, there was a prodigious Number of Boats round the Ships on the Out&s;ide of the Men of Wars Boats, which kept off all others. Not a Soul was &s;uffered to be on Board except tho&s;e belong|ing to the Ship. But tho&s;e Ships that lay any Way near her were greatly crouded with Spectators, all their Shrouds and Tops being full, altho' it was then difficult to &s;ee any Thing on board the <HI>Monarque.</HI> Mr. <HI>Byng</HI> walked out of the Great Cabbin to the Quarter-Deck, where he &s;uffered on the Larboard Side, a few Minutes before 12 o'Clock accompanied by a Clergyman, who attended him during his Confine|ment, and two Gentlemen his Relations. He was dre&s;&s;ed in a light grey Coat, white Wai&s;tcoat, and white Stockings, and a large white Wig, and had in each Hand a white Handkerchief. He threw his Hat on the Deck, kneeled on it, tied one Handkerchief over his Eyes, and dropped the other as a Signal, on which a Volley from &s;ix Marines was fired, five of who&s;e Bullets went through him, and he was, in an In&s;tant no more. He in&s;i&s;ted on not having any Thing before his Face, but was greatly pre&s;&s;ed to it, being per&s;uaded it was not otherwi&s;e de|cent, and that the Marines might be intimidated from taking proper Aim. His coming out of the the Cabbin, which I particularly ob&s;er|ved,
<PB N="46" REF="007865_0045_102DEC0D748582C8">
from die Stillne&s;s and Attention of all on board, could not be two Minutes to his Death. In &s;hort, he died with great Re&s;olution and Compo&s;ure, without the lea&s;t Sign of Timidity, and the Moment the Mu&s;kets went off, there was a blue Pendant thrown out at the Fore|topma&s;t-head, which continued flying about five Minutes, and was then &s;truck; on which all the Men of Wars Boats went off to repair on board their re&s;pective Ships.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramillies,</HI> the Ship the Admiral had in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> was riding at her Moorings in the Harbour, and about Half an Hour before he &s;uffered &s;he broke her Mooring-Chain and only held by the Bridle, which is looked on as a wonderful Incident by People who do not con&s;ider the high Wind at that Time.</P>

my own Innocence; and am con&s;cious, that no Part of my Country's Misfortunes, can be owing to me. I heartily wi&s;h, that the &s;hedding of my Blood, may contribute to the Happine&s;s and Service of my Country; but cannot re&s;ign my ju&s;t Claim to a faithful Di&s;charge of my Duty, according to the be&s;t of my Judgment, and the utmo&s;t Ex|ertion of my Ability, for his Maje&s;ty's Honour, and my Country's. Service. I am &s;orry that my Endeavours were not attended with more Succe&s;s, and the Armament under my Command proved too weak to &s;ucceed in an Expedition of &s;uch Moment.</P>
<P>Truth has prevailed over Calumny and Fal&s;hood, and Ju&s;tice has wiped off the ignominious Stain of my &s;uppo&s;ed Want of per&s;onal Courage, or Di&s;affection. My Heart acquits me of the&s;e Crimes. But who can be pre&s;umptou&s;ly &s;ure of his own Judgment? If my Crime is an Error in Judgment, or differing in Opinion from my Judge&mdash;and if yet, the Error of Judgment &s;hould be on their Side, God forgive them, as I do; and may the Di&s;tre&s;s of their Minds, and Unea&s;ine&s;s of their Con&s;ciences, which, in Ju&s;tice to me, they have repre&s;ented, be relieved, and &s;ub&s;ide, as my Re&s;entment has done.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme Judge &s;ees all Hearts, and Motives, and to him I mu&s;t &s;ubmit the Ju&s;tice of my Cau&s;e.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Port&s;mouth, March 22.</HI></P>
<P>TO &s;atisfy your Enquiry, as to the Ceremony u&s;ed in the Execu|tion of the late Admiral <HI>Byng,</HI> I am to acquaint you, that the Place where Offenders generally did by &s;hooting is on the Foreca&s;tle; but he was &s;o far indulged as to &s;uffer on the Quarter-Deck.</P>
<P>Twelve o'Clock being the Time fixed for his Death, Capt. <HI>Mon|tague</HI> looking at his Watch, acquainted him the Time was come. The Admiral returned for An&s;wer, it wanted &s;ome Minutes, and he would &s;tay to the la&s;t; however he &s;oon come up with a becoming Steadine&s;s, though there was a vi&s;ible Trembling, as the Struggles of Nature can|not be hid from an ob&s;erving Eye. A white Neckcloth he tied over
<PB N="48" REF="007865_0047_102DEC128E8D6720" MS="y">
his Eyes. A Canvas Cu&s;hion being laid, and upon that a green Velvet one, on which he kneeled, he gave the Signal for firing, by dropping a red and white Handkerchief. Nine Marines were appointed, &s;ix, to fire fir&s;t, three kneeling and three &s;tanding; five Shot went through his Body into the Ship's Side, and &s;o far, that they could not be bored out with a Gimblet, and one lay in his Body.&mdash;The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for no Blood i&s;&s;uing is, that his Body was wrapped round with Cotton in &s;uch a curious Manner, as that not one Drop appeared.</P>
<P>He fell on his left Side, and made but one Shudder in the Agonies of Death, upon which a Cloak was thrown over him till the Coffin was ready to receive him, into which he was put, with all the Cloaths he had on except his Coat.</P>
<P>The In&s;cription on the Coffin is, The Hon. JOHN BYNG died <HI>March</HI> 14, 1757. aged 52.</P>
