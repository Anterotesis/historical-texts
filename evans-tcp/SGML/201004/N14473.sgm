<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE powers of thinking and choice are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to all rational &s;pirits, that without them no idea can be formed of their exi&s;tence. A de&s;ire of the knowledge and enjoyment of the be&s;t good, al&s;o appears e&s;&s;ential to their nature. There|fore as finite knowledge is limited, finite &s;pirits would ever be liable to err, if they had not &s;ome &s;ufficient guard again&s;t it. And the be&s;t guard we can conceive of, is a clear fixed per&s;ua&s;ion in the heart, that God is the only fountain of all good; and that every de&s;irable good is to be obtained and enjoyed in the way of obedience to his reveal|ed will, and nowhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT he is the ab&s;olute proprietor, and the &s;o|vereign ruler of the worlds he has made, is a truth too evident for any but madmen to deny. All na|tions have been forced to appeal to him, to avenge inju&s;tice and perjury, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h any go|vernment among them&s;elves: Yet how far have they been from a willingne&s;s to be governed entire|ly by him! <HI>He made man upright; but they have &s;ought out many inventions.</HI> Objects of wor&s;hip, and forms of wor&s;hip, even without number, have been in|vented by mankind; the folly whereof God has ex|po&s;ed in all his di&s;pen&s;ations: Yet &s;elf-conceit, &s;elf-&s;eeking, and &s;elf-dependence, are &s;till the ruining errors of the world.</P>

HIS de&s;ign in all his di&s;pen&s;ations, in every age and every country, is undoubtedly the &s;ame in na|ture with that declared to I&s;rael, in the pa&s;&s;age which adorns our title page. Three things de&s;erve particular notice therein.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is the Lord who leads his people through all the changing &s;cenes of life, in this wilderne&s;s world. At differ|ent times and places their circum&s;tances vary ex|ceedingly; yet he orders or over-rules in all, &s;o that a &s;parrow cannot fall to the ground, nor an hair from their head, without him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. All his deal|ings are calculated in infinite wi&s;dom, for their trial and humiliation; to di&s;cover what is in their hearts, whether they will keep HIS commandments, or not. Therefore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He requires them to <HI>remember</HI> all the way wherein he leads them, for this end.</ITEM>

<P>CHRISTIANITY, the only true religion, has its name from CHRIST, the foundation, lawgiver, and only head of his church. And one of the greate&s;t hi&s;torians of our age gives us the following ac|count of its primitive order and government. Says he, "The rites in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t were only two in number, and the&s;e de&s;igned to continue to the end of the church here below, without any varia|tion. The&s;e were bapti&s;m and the holy &s;upper; which were not to be con&s;idered as mere ceremo|nies, nor yet as &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations only, but al&s;o as ordinances, accompanied with &s;anctifying influence upon the heart and affections of true Chri&s;tians." Of tho&s;e who heard and believed the preaching of John the Bapti&s;t, he &s;ays, "They were initiated into the kingdom of the Redeemer, by the ceremony of <HI>immer&s;ion</HI> or <HI>bapti&s;m.</HI>" And during the fir&s;t century, he &s;ays, "The &s;acrament of bapti&s;m was admini&s;tered without the public a&s;&s;em|blies,
<PB N="v" REF="018336_0004_0FA5D372180B9038">in places appointed and prepared for that purpo&s;e, and was performed by <HI>immer&s;ion</HI> of the whole body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim's eccl. hi&s;t. vol. 1, p. 32, 91, 96. Dublin edition</NOTE>." This was the primitive way of admi&s;&s;ion into the Chri&s;tian church; and of its go|vernment our author &s;ays, "The people were, undoubtedly, the fir&s;t in authority; for the apo&s;tles &s;hewed by their example, that nothing of moment was to be carried on or determined without the con&s;ent of the a&s;&s;embly, Acts i. 15, vi. 3, xv. 4 xxi. 22.&mdash;A bi&s;hop, during the fir&s;t and &s;econd cen|tury, was a per&s;on who had the care of one Chri&s;|tian a&s;&s;embly, which, at that time, was, generally &s;peaking, &s;mall enough to be contained in a pri|vate hou&s;e. In this a&s;&s;embly he acted not &s;o much with the authority of a <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> as with the zeal and diligence of a faithful <HI>&s;ervant.</HI>" And he a&s;&s;ures us, that until about the middle of the &s;econd century, "The churches were entirely <HI>independent;</HI> none of them &s;ubject to any foreign juri&s;diction, but each one governed by its own rulers, and its own laws." And that an alteration was then made, by indu&s;|triou&s;ly propagating the opinion, that Chri&s;tian mini&s;ters &s;ucceeded to the rights and privileges of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;thood<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 70, 76, 77, 139.</NOTE> Heathen philo&s;ophy was al&s;o called in to interpret the &s;criptures by; from whence teachers adopted this maxim, viz. "That it was an act of virtue to <HI>deceive and lie,</HI> when by that means the <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> of the church might be pro|moted." To which they added, in the fourth cen|tury, under Con&s;tantine, the u&s;e of <HI>temporal penal+ties,</HI> and <HI>corporal tortures,</HI> for the &s;ame end<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Page 155, 314.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the mean time a controver&s;y aro&s;e about bringing infants to bapti&s;m. In the beginning of
<PB N="vi" REF="018336_0005_0FA5D372F26E56E0">the third century, Tertullian, who is the fir&s;t writer that mentions it, oppo&s;ed it, &s;aying, "What need is there that the <HI>god-fathers</HI> &s;hould be brought into danger? becau&s;e they may either fail of their promi&s;es by death, or they may be mi&s;taken by a child's proving of a wicked di&s;po&s;ition." But not long after Origen appeared for the practice, and &s;aid, "Let it be con&s;idered what is the rea&s;on, that whereas the bapti&s;m of the church is given for the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, infants al&s;o are, <HI>by the u&s;age of the church,</HI> baptized.&mdash;It is for that rea&s;on, becau&s;e by the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken away,</HI> that infants are baptized<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clark again&s;t Gill upon bapti&s;m, p. 105, 111.</NOTE>." Origen is the fir&s;t man that any have produced, who plead|ed for infant bapti&s;m; and he al&s;o held that the torments of the damned will have an end; and that Chri&s;t will be crucified in the next world to &s;ave the devils<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim, vol. 1, p. 476.</NOTE> Now when heathen philo&s;ophy was &s;et up as a rule to interpret &s;cripture by; when the &s;ha|dows of the old te&s;tament were taken to draw a veil over the truth, and church order de&s;cribed in the go&s;pel, and teachers pretended to confer renewing grace by their admini&s;trations, before the &s;ubjects were taught or believed; and al&s;o called in the &s;e|cular arm to enforce their mea&s;ures by temporal penalties and corporal tortures, what could be ex|pected but the Antichri&s;tian apo&s;ta&s;y! Oh, how dark was the night that followed!</P>
<P>YET God did not leave him&s;elf without witne&s;&s;es in the darke&s;t times, &s;ome of whom I will name. Peter de Bruys, during a mini&s;try of twenty years, made the mo&s;t laudable attempts to reform abu&s;es, and to remove the &s;uper&s;titions that disfigured the
<PB N="vii" REF="018336_0006_0FA5D373B4CEE7D8">beautiful &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and had a great number of followers, in Languedoc and Provence in France; and he was burnt therefor at St. Giles, in the year 1130. His di&s;ciples were called Pe|trobu&s;cians; and a leading article of their faith was, "That no per&s;ons whatever were to be baptized before they came to the full u&s;e of their rea&s;on." Soon after another mini&s;ter, who&s;e name was Hen|ry, travelled from Switzerland through various parts of France, preaching the go&s;pel with great &s;ucce&s;s, until he came to the city of Thoulou&s;e; where the Pope and his creatures rai&s;ed great oppo|&s;ition again&s;t him, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on in 1148; and he ended his days there not long after. He was thus dealt with becau&s;e "He rejected the bap|ti&s;m of infants; cen&s;ured with &s;everity the corrupt and licentious manners of the clergy, and treated the fe&s;tivals and ceremonies of the church with the utmo&s;t contempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2, p. 437&mdash;439</NOTE>."</P>
<P>THIS account is given by a very learned Luthe|ran author, who was &s;trongly prejudiced again&s;t the modern Bapti&s;ts, becau&s;e he held that the Chri&s;tian church was in its minority, when it was governed in the manner above de&s;cribed; and that in its mature age, "The regulation of it was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be accommodated to the time, and left to the wi&s;dom and prudence of the chief rulers, both of the &s;tate and of the church<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1, p. 63&mdash;70.</NOTE>;" which opinion the Bapti&s;ts have ever oppo&s;ed. He freely owns, that the pecu|liarities of their churches in Germany and Holland are derived from a maxim of reformation, which was held by the Walden&s;es, Petrobu&s;cians, Wicklifites, and Hu&s;&s;ites, long before Luther's day; which is, "That the kingdom of Chri&s;t, or the vi&s;ible church
<PB N="viii" REF="018336_0007_0FA5D374875F6F98">he had e&s;tabli&s;hed upon earth, was an a&s;&s;embly of true and real &s;aints, and ought therefore to be inac|ce&s;&s;ible to the wicked and unrighteous, and al&s;o ex|empt from all tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which human pru|dence &s;ugge&s;ts to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of iniquity, or to correct and reform tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors." This max|im he declares to be the &s;ource of all their peculiari|ties. In 1525, and in 1533, a few men who were called Anabapti&s;ts, took the lead among mixed mul|titudes, that had taken up arms again&s;t cruel tyrants, in hopes of recovering both civil and religious li|berty thereby; but they peri&s;hed in the attempt: A &s;ight of which carried the Bapti&s;t churches in that country &s;o far into the other extreme, as not to allow their members to be magi&s;trates, to u&s;e the &s;word, or to take an oath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 3, p. 524, 525, 549</NOTE>; which are now the &s;entiments of the German Bapti&s;ts in Penn&s;ylvania. But the Engli&s;h Bapti&s;ts, both in Europe and America, has carefully avoided each of the&s;e extremes, for the&s;e hundred and fifty years; yet tho&s;e &s;candals in Ger|many have been con&s;tantly ca&s;t upon them, even down to this day; not becau&s;e they ever had the lea&s;t concern therewith, but becau&s;e this has been found to be a powerful engine to prejudice the populace again&s;t allowing equal religious liberty, and for forcing people into religious covenants, before they can choo&s;e for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>ALL the reformation that ever took place, in any age or country, was produced by the word of truth, enforced by the &s;pirit of truth, upon each heart and con&s;cience. And the admi&s;&s;ion of un&s;anctified com|municants into the Chri&s;tian church, and of the in|ventions of men to govern it, have cau&s;ed endle&s;s confu&s;ions; as thereby three oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts have
<PB N="ix" REF="018336_0008_0FA5D37515D45930">been &s;et up. The intere&s;t of religious teachers, of civil officers, and of the people. The two former have con&s;pired together to en&s;lave the latter; and yet have been far from an entire harmony betwixt them&s;elves. Their conte&s;ts for preheminence have been long and tedious in this country; but a great and effectual door is now opened for terminating the&s;e di&s;putes, and for a return to the primitive pu|rity and liberty of the Chri&s;tian church. To trace out the evil effects of the apo&s;ta&s;y, and to promote, as much as may be, &s;uch a return, is the great de|&s;ign both of this and the former volume; in the compiling whereof a large number of records, books and papers, have been &s;earched, and much pains taken to &s;et principles and actions in as clear light as po&s;&s;ible. And the author is &s;o far from de|&s;iring indulgence in any mi&s;takes, that he earne&s;tly reque&s;ts the help of all to correct them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THE fathers of New-England came much nearer to the apo&s;tolic order of the church, than mo&s;t other reformers had done. Dr. Cotton Mather publi&s;hed a &s;pecimen thereof in the year 1690. Says he, "A church (as the Greek name
<PB N="2" REF="018336_0017_0FA5D384EF321B88">for it allows us to think) is to con&s;i&s;t of a people <HI>called out</HI> from the ways of &s;in, by the powerful and effectual work of God upon their &s;ouls. Regene|ration is the thing without which a title unto &s;acra|ments is not to be pretended. Real regeneration is the thing which before God renders men capable of claiming &s;acraments; and vi&s;ible and expre&s;&s;ed regeneration is that which before men enables us to make &s;uch a claim<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Companion for communicants, p. 29, 30, 37.</NOTE>." From the fir&s;t planting of the country to 1662, none were allowed to come to the ordinance of the &s;upper, nor to bring their infants to bapti&s;m, without &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion. The &s;ynod of that year opened a door for the children of church members to bring their infants upon a lower profe&s;&s;ion; though in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a profe&s;&s;ion of regeneration was &s;till held to be nece&s;|&s;ary, in order for coming to full communion, or having a vote in the government, either of church or &s;tate. This was e&s;&s;ential to the nature of their plan, of a holy government, in imitation of the church of I&s;rael. And for the church to govern the world, for good men to govern bad ones, &s;eemed much more rational and &s;criptural, than for the world to govern the church about &s;oul-guides, as they have done &s;ince: Previous to which the country was involved in mo&s;t deplorable circum|&s;tances. Their charter lo&s;t; their &s;ea-coa&s;ts in|fe&s;ted with privateers and pirates, and their fron|tiers with &s;avage enemies. An attempt to take Quebec in 1690 was defeated, which enraged the enemy the more again&s;t them, and al&s;o involved the country in a heavy debt; to di&s;charge which paper money was fir&s;t made here, the effects where|of were very pernicious. Officers and people were
<PB N="3" REF="018336_0018_0FA5D3865F974F90">greatly divided in their minds about the cau&s;es of the&s;e calamities, and about what was the be&s;t way to remove them. And in this juncture they were alarmed with an apprehen&s;ion that the powers of hell were let loo&s;e upon them, which amazed and confounded them inexpre&s;&s;ibly. The &s;cene was introduced in the following manner:</P>
<P N="2">II. A VARIETY of books, concerning witch|craft, had been publi&s;hed in London and Bo&s;ton, which were di&s;per&s;ed in New-England. And near the clo&s;e of 1691, a young daughter and a neice of Mr. Samuel Parris, mini&s;ter of Salem village (now Danvers) with two other girls in the neighbour|hood, made &s;uch complaints of di&s;tre&s;s and inju|ries upon their bodies, that a phy&s;ician pronounced them bewitched. Hereupon an Indian woman, from New-Spain, that lived at the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, tried &s;ome experiments to find out the witch, which &s;he pretended to have been u&s;ed to in her own country. This coming to the knowledge of tho&s;e children, they accu&s;ed her of being the witch; of appearing to them, and pinching, pricking and tor|menting of them. Teachers, rulers and people, were &s;o much affected with this calamity, as to keep days of fa&s;ting and prayer for its removal; fir&s;t at &s;aid mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, next in the village, and then through the Colony. Such notice being taken of and pity &s;hown to tho&s;e children, they increa&s;ed their complaints; and others advanced like accu&s;a|tions, not only again&s;t the Indian woman, but al&s;o again&s;t two other old women in the place, &s;o that all the three were committed to pri&s;on on March 1, 1692. And this noi&s;e increa&s;ed, and &s;uch accu&s;a|tions &s;pread, till about an hundred per&s;ons were impri&s;oned on that account. In the mid&s;t of which di&s;tre&s;s, on May 14, Sir William Phips, the Gover|nor,
<PB N="4" REF="018336_0019_0FA5D3871BDD77F8">arrived at Bo&s;ton with their new charter, in company with Dr. Increa&s;e Mather, who procured it. The Governor and Council were &s;o much con|cerned to purge this growing evil from the land, that they did not wait for the meeting of the legi&s;|lature, to whom the con&s;tituting of Courts of Ju&s;tice belonged, but con&s;tituted one them&s;elves, whereof Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton was Pre&s;i|dent, and by their &s;entence one woman was hanged on June 10; and by September 22, they executed &s;even men and thirteen women; after which that Court was di&s;&s;olved. And by the time that a Court of Oyer and Terminer was con&s;tituted according to charter, rulers and mini&s;ters were &s;o far convinced that they had acted upon wrong principles, and had al&s;o admitted the te&s;timony of accu&s;ers without &s;ufficient care and caution, that all the re&s;t of the accu&s;ed were either acquitted upon trial, or par|doned by authority. A fir&s;t principle that they acted upon in tho&s;e condemnations was, that God in his providence would not &s;uffer the devil to appear to and afflict any in the &s;hape of an innocent per&s;on. And they admitted one accu&s;er to one in&s;tance, and another to another, of tho&s;e &s;pectoral appearances, to make up two witne&s;&s;es. They al&s;o who would confe&s;s them&s;elves to be witches, were admitted as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t others. And, &s;ays a gentleman who was a careful ob&s;erver of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, "The&s;e confe&s;&s;ors, by their plau&s;ible confe&s;&s;ions and accu&s;ations of others, begetting cre|dit, have been a great, if not the greate&s;t engine of Satan to carry on the accu&s;ing and apprehending of others, until this matter came to &s;uch a height, that, if it had not been &s;topped, might have brought the be&s;t Chri&s;tians in the country under the imputation of that abomination, and have involved all in con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="5" REF="018336_0020_0FA5D387D9A99C50">and blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mode&s;t enquiry into the nature of witchcraft, by John Hale, mini&s;ter of Beverly, 1697. p. 78.</NOTE>." Deplorable indeed was the ca&s;e of New-England at that time; though we are a&s;&s;ured, by men who have &s;earched fully into the matter, that a greater number of per&s;ons were exe|cuted for witchcraft in only one county in England, even in the loo&s;e reign of Charles the &s;econd, than all that were put to death here; and al&s;o that the&s;e executions were under the influence of laws and precedents from thence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hale, p. 25; 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; 69. Hutchin&s;on, vol. 2, p. 16, 22, 69.</NOTE> But this being a new country, it was more taken notice of, and was more &s;everely felt than there.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE cannot find that the Bapti&s;ts had any hand in tho&s;e confu&s;ed and bloody proceedings; yet much pains have been taken to turn the &s;ame again&s;t them. A late mini&s;ter of Danvers, the place where tho&s;e delu&s;ions began, &s;ays, "It is reported of witches, and tho&s;e that hold unlawful commerce with evil &s;pirits, that in order to their entering into confederacy with them, they are &s;olicited to re|nounce their bapti&s;m, even though received in in|fancy; which &s;hews, that &s;uch a renunciation of bapti&s;m, which Dr. Gill pleads for and commends, is matter of <HI>great impiety</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Clark again&s;t Gill, 1752, p. 33.</NOTE>." What Dr. Gill plead|ed for, was the renouncing of infant &s;prinkling, and the practi&s;ing of believer's bapti&s;m, according to primitive in&s;titution. But how far was that from the witchcraft at Danvers or Salem! The plaine&s;t in&s;tances of any mention of bapti&s;m there|in were as follow. In the examination of a woman before authority, July 21, 1992, were the&s;e que&s;|tions and an&s;wers, viz. "Q. Goody Lacey! how many years ago &s;ince they were baptized? A.

<P N="4">IV. THE &s;econd Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter, which was dated October 7, 1691, allowed equal liber|ty of con&s;cience to all Chri&s;tians, except Papi&s;ts. The fir&s;t General Court under it met a Bo&s;ton June 9, 1692, to whom Dr. Cotton Mather de|livered a &s;ermon, wherein he &s;aid, "The civil Magi&s;trate is mo&s;t properly the officer of human &s;ociety, and a Chri&s;tian, by nonconformity to this or that impo&s;ed way of wor&s;hip, does not break the terms on which he is to enjoy the benefits of human &s;ociety." And ten years after he publi&s;hed this and other pa&s;&s;ages, in his hi&s;tory of New-England, and &s;aid he would thereby &s;top the noi&s;e about per&s;ecution therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, b. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 28, 29.</NOTE> But how could that be done? for he &s;aid, "The General A&s;&s;embly may, by their acts, give a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> encou|ragement unto the religion which is the <HI>general profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the inhabitants<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Account of his father's life, p. 141.</NOTE>." That is, may em|power &s;ome to judge for others about wor&s;hip, and to enforce their judgments with the &s;word; which is the root of the wor&s;t per&s;ecutions in the world. He knew that &s;uch acts as he &s;pake of could not take place here without the royal a&s;&s;ent; yet &s;aid he "I am verily per&s;uaded, that the nearne&s;s of our depen|dence on the crown will be found one of our mo&s;t glorious advantages."

<P>THEY had here entered upon a new and untried &s;cence; and the glaring contradiction betwixt the two la&s;t paragraphs of this law, with their finding that &s;ome towns had more than one church therein, as al&s;o that Bo&s;ton would not &s;ubmit to it, cau&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly, in their next &s;e&s;&s;ion of February 8, 1693, to repeal tho&s;e two paragraphs, and in ad|dition to the re&s;t of that law to enact, "That each re&s;pective gathered church, in any town or place within this Province, that at any time &s;hall be in want of a mini&s;ter, &s;uch church &s;hall have power, according to the directions given in the word of God, to choo&s;e their own mini&s;ter;" yet not to &s;ettle him without the concurrence of the majority of voters in town affairs, who u&s;ually meet therewith for wor&s;hip; but that being ob|tained, then "all the inhabitants and rateable e&s;tates lying within &s;uch town, or part of a town, or place, limited by law for upholding the public wor&s;hip of God, &s;hall be obliged to pay in pro|portion towards the mini&s;ter's &s;ettlement and &s;upport.

VII. THIS I carefully copied from the original, pre&s;erved in Elder Luther's family; and Bri&s;tol Court could not be ignorant of his being thus owned as the &s;ettled mini&s;ter of Swanzey; yet this attempt mu&s;t be made for the other denomination, though they have never been able to &s;et up their wor&s;hip in that town to this day. A &s;econd Bapti&s;t church was formed therein, and Mr. Thomas Barnes was ordained pa&s;tor of it in 1693. It may be &s;ervicea|ble to enquire into the rea&s;on of their being &s;o much better treated when under Plymouth govern|ment, than they were after they were incorporated with the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>PLYMOUTH people were taught in Holland, that the church was the &s;chool wherein Chri&s;t trained up his mini&s;ters; though they were far from de|&s;pi&s;ing human learning in its place. One of their proofs was the 14th chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians; upon which their learned pa&s;|tor, Mr. Robin&s;on, made the following remarks. Says he, "That the Apo&s;tle in this chapter directs the church in the u&s;e of extraordinary gifts, is mo&s;t evident: Neither will I deny but that the officers are to guide and order this action of <HI>pro|phe&s;ying,</HI> as all other public bu&s;ine&s;s, yea, even the&s;e wherein the brethren have greate&s;t liberty: But that he intends the e&s;tabli&s;hing of, and &s;o takes order, and gives direction for an ordinary con&s;tant exerci&s;e in the church, even by men out of office, I do manife&s;t by the&s;e rea&s;ons.
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Becau&s;e the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the mini&s;tration of a gift or grace, common to all per&s;ons, as well brethren as mini&s;ters, ordinary as extraordinary, and that at all times, which is <HI>love;</HI> as al&s;o of &s;uch fruits and effects of that grace, as are no le&s;s common to all than the grace it&s;elf, nor of le&s;s

<ITEM>(2.) In ver. 21, he permits <HI>all</HI> to <HI>prophe&s;y,</HI> and &s;peaks as largely of pro|phe&s;ying as of <HI>learning,</HI> and <HI>receiving comfort.</HI> But le&s;t any &s;hould object, may women al&s;o prophe&s;y? the apo&s;tle prevents that objection, and it may be reproves that di&s;order among&s;t the Corinthians, ver. 34, by a flat inhibition, enjoining them ex|pre&s;ly to keep &s;ilence in the church, in the pre&s;ence of men, to whom they ought to be &s;ubject, and to learn at home of their hu&s;bands, and not by teach|ing men to u&s;urp authority over them, 1 Tim. ii. 11, 12, which men in prophe&s;ying do lawfully u&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) Now in that Paul forbids women, he gives liberty to all men, gifted accordingly, op|po&s;ing women to men, &s;ex to &s;ex, and not women to officers, which were frivolous. And again, in re&s;training women, he &s;hews his meaning to be of ordinary, not extraordinary prophe&s;ying; for women immediately and extraordinarily in&s;pired might &s;peak without re&s;traint, Exod. xv. 20, Judg. iv. 4, Luke ii. 36.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) The prophets here &s;poken of were not extraordinary, becau&s;e their doctrines were to be <HI>judged</HI> by other prophets, and their <HI>&s;pirits</HI> to be <HI>&s;ubject</HI> unto the <HI>&s;pirits of others,</HI> ver. 29, 32; whereas the doctrines of the extraor|dinary prophets were neither &s;ubject to nor to be judged by any; but they, as the Apo&s;tles, be|ing immediately in&s;pired, were <HI>the foundation</HI> upon which the church was built, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone,</HI> Eph. ii. 20, and iii. 5.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(5.) The apo&s;tle makes a <HI>prophet</HI> and a man <HI>&s;piritual</HI> all one, whom he further de&s;cribes, not by any extraordinary gift, but by that common Chri&s;tian grace of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion unto <HI>the things he

<P N="8">VIII. Now, as the church of Plymouth had al|ways acted upon the&s;e principles, it was ea&s;y for them to look upon Elder Luther as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who&s;e church was of the &s;ame mind about that point of go&s;pel order. But a mini&s;ter of chief note among the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;ays, "That cu&s;tom, of the prophe&s;ying of private brethren, was not ob&s;erved in any of the churches of New-England be&s;ides them&s;elves: The mini&s;ters of the re&s;pective churches there not being &s;o well &s;atisfied in the way thereof as Mr. Robin&s;on was. The mo&s;t judicious and leading elders among &s;aid churches, as Mr. Cotton, &amp;c. that were not ab&s;olutely again&s;t the thing, were yet afraid that the wantonne&s;s of the pre&s;ent age would not well bear &s;uch a liberty as that great light of the&s;e churches expre&s;&s;ed, to

And &s;urely nothing hath more in former days advanced, nor doth at this day more uphold the throne of Antichri&s;t, than the people's di&s;charging them&s;elves of the care of public affairs in the church, on the one &s;ide, and the prie&s;ts and prelates arrogating all to them&s;elves on the other<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on, p. 204.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="9">IX. Two brethren of Plymouth church were ordained pa&s;tors of other churches in 1694. One of them was Mr. Jonathan Donham, who was ordained at Edgarton, on Martha's Vineyard. The other was at Middleborough, fourteen miles we&s;t of Plymouth. About &s;ixteen families began to plant here a little before Philip's war; who moved away when the war broke out, and returned again after it was over; and Mr. Samuel Fuller preached to them till a church was con&s;tituted among them this year, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor. The &s;ettlement of Dartmouth began about the &s;ame time with Middleborough, and their fir&s;t teacher was al&s;o from Plymouth, but not in the &s;ame way. His name was John Cooke, who was a deacon in Plymouth church for &s;ome years; but was ca&s;t out of it in the latter part of Mr. Reyner's mini&s;try there, who left them in November, 1654. It is &s;aid that Cooke was excommunicated for having been the author of much di&s;&s;ention and divi&s;ion, and for
<PB N="17" REF="018336_0032_0FA5D397523E1EC8">afterwards running into &s;ectarian and Anabapti&s;tical principles. And al&s;o that Reyner's removal was partly occa&s;ioned by the un&s;ettledne&s;s of the church, "Too many of the members being leavened with prejudices again&s;t a <HI>learned</HI> mini&s;try, by means of <HI>&s;ectaries</HI> then &s;preading through the land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plymouth regi&s;ter, p. 4, 12.</NOTE>." Some light concerning them may be gathered from the following facts. Plymouth church took much pains to obtain learned pa&s;tors, if they were other|wi&s;e well qualified; but they refu&s;ed to be con|fined to human &s;chools for mini&s;ters, or to compel the world to &s;upport them. They laboured hard to get the learned Mr. Charles Chauncy to &s;ettle as a colleague with Mr. Reyner; but Mr. Chauncy could not con&s;ent to it, becau&s;e go&s;pel bapti&s;m appeared to him to be <HI>dipping,</HI> and that &s;prinkling for bapti&s;m was <HI>unlawful,</HI> as their church records wit|ne&s;s. In 1650 a &s;eparation commenced at Re|hoboth, becau&s;e Mr. Newman, their mini&s;ter, with &s;ix others, a&s;&s;umed all the power of church govern|ment to them&s;elves, under the name of "The church repre&s;entative<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Clarke's narrative, p. 24.</NOTE>." For this u&s;urpation a number of the church withdrew, and &s;et up wor|&s;hip by them&s;elves; and the mini&s;ters tried hard to move Plymouth Court to &s;uppre&s;s them by force, but could not prevail therein. The&s;e people &s;oon after became Bapti&s;ts; and one of them was mo&s;t &s;hamefully and cruelly per&s;ecuted the next year at Bo&s;ton. By &s;earching into the&s;e matters, Mr. Dun|&s;tar, Pre&s;ident of Harvard college, was brought openly to renounce infant bapti&s;m. And &s;eeing the temper which was di&s;covered in the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;&s;etts, he removed into Plymouth Colony, the
<PB N="18" REF="018336_0033_0FA5D3979C07A4D8">very year that Reyner moved out of it; as &s;everal other mini&s;ters al&s;o did about that time, becau&s;e they could not bring Plymouth rulers into the u&s;e of tax and compul&s;ion for their &s;upport.

And though Reyner ex|communicated Cooke, yet, not being able to bring the church into all his mea&s;ures, he left them, and robbed them of their church-records, which they never recovered; &s;o that what records Plymouth church now has, were afterwards collected from memory and private writings. The&s;e facts may help the reader in forming a judgment of what Cooke's &s;ectarian principles were, and al&s;o how he came by them. His po&s;terity inform me, that he was a Bapti&s;t, and that he preached the doctrine of election, with the other doctrines of &s;overeign grace, in Dartmouth for a number of years. And it appears by Mr. Samuel Hubbard's letters, that a Bapti&s;t church was formed upon the we&s;t borders of Dartmouth, in the year 1685, wherein Hugh Mo&s;ier and Aaron Davis were principal leaders; which church is continued by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to this day; though the Quakers are the mo&s;t numerous of any one &s;ect in that town.</P>

ON Augu&s;t 24, 1695, the church of Middle|borough was bereaved of their beloved pa&s;tor, aet. 66; "A great lo&s;s to the place, &s;aid Mr. Cotton, he being a &s;incere godly man, and u&s;eful preacher." Mr. I&s;aac Cu&s;hman, another member of Plymouth church, was invited to &s;ucceed him; but having a call at Plymton (betwixt here and Plymouth) at the &s;ame time, he accepted it; and was ordained there in 1698<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. John Cotton, above referred to, was &s;on to the famous mini&s;ter of that name in Bo&s;ton.

This with other things moved their churches to look only to colleges for mini&s;ters for a long time after. In the mean while, as the empowering the world to controul the church in the choice of pa&s;tors was an untried path to them, it took them three years to find out what to do, when a pari&s;h did not concur with the church therein. But when the A&s;&s;embly met at Bo&s;ton, May 29, 1695, they enacted, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e the church &s;hould call a council of three or five neighbouring churches, who &s;hould decide the con|trover&s;y thus: If the council approved of the per|&s;on elected, the pari&s;h mu&s;t &s;ubmit and &s;upport him; if not, then the church mu&s;t give up their choice, and call another mini&s;ter, and in this method they have proceeded ever &s;ince.

<P N="1">1. THE learned and pious Mr. Thomas Prince &s;ays, "The &s;econd generation ri&s;ing and growing thick on the &s;tage, a little after 1660, there began to appear a <HI>decay;</HI> and this increa&s;ed to 1670, when it grew vi&s;ible and threatening, and was generally complained of and bewailed bitterly by the pious among them; and yet much more to 1680, when but few of the fir&s;t generation re|mained." One of his proofs hereof is what Mr. William Stoughton delivered in an election &s;ermon at Bo&s;ton, April 29, 1668; when he &s;aid, "The death and removal of the Lord's eminent &s;ervants, in one rank and in another, hath manife&s;ted the <HI>lie</HI> in many of us. Whil&s;t they lived, their piety

But now they are gone, ah! how doth the un&s;oundne&s;s, the rottenne&s;s and hypocri&s;y of too many among us make it&s;elf known, as it was with Joa&s;h after the death of Jehoiada<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tian hi&s;t. vol. 1. p. 94, 95.

<P N="2">II. IN 1680 Mr. Willard &s;aid, "Be &s;ure, when the glory of God and the &s;piritual good of your brother requires it, that you carry on your reproofs to conviction. There are &s;ome things that ari&s;e only from &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, and there a tran&s;ient rebuke may be enough: Other things may be de|liberate, and men are led into them more gradu|ally; they may al&s;o be eminently reproachful to religion, and a dangerous &s;nare to the &s;ouls of them that are tempted; our connivance in &s;uch ca&s;es may not only blemi&s;h our profe&s;&s;ion, but be a great hazard to it al&s;o. At &s;uch times, and in &s;uch ca&s;e, you <HI>break your covenant</HI> if you &s;uffer &s;in in your brother, without u&s;ing all the means which Chri&s;t hath pre&s;cribed, and in the order he hath pre&s;cribed them, till the end be obtained. If pri|vate admonition followed with gentlene&s;s and pa|tience will not gain, but they &s;till per&s;i&s;t in evil cour&s;es, or are not humbled for &s;uch faults, you mu&s;t proceed by &s;teps as far as Chri&s;t has bid you. And I believe there is no one thing wherein the covenant is more univer&s;ally broken, than in ne|glect of this duty; and if the u&s;e of the&s;e ordinances &s;hall once come to cea&s;e among the churches, and the &s;ins of church members be not regularly &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="22" REF="018336_0037_0FA5D39D5D535300">by rea&s;on of the unfaithfulne&s;s of brethren, religion will langui&s;h, and the power of godline&s;s fail. It is not the extending of the covenant to Chri&s;tians (as &s;ome dream) but the neglect of covenant duties towards them, that is like to be the bane of our profe&s;&s;ion, if any thing. Eli indulged his &s;ons, and one profe&s;&s;or indulgeth another; and it is to be feared, that if this were &s;earched to the bottom, it would be found that the original of it is &s;elf-indulgence, and that when men wink at &s;candals in their brethren, it is be|cau&s;e they expect the like in way of retaliation: And if things once come to this pa&s;s, let any &s;ober and prudent man conjecture whether this be not the way to <HI>cheri&s;h apo&s;ta&s;y.</HI>" Dr. Increa&s;e Mather, in the preface, gave a &s;pecial recommendation of this pa&s;&s;age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willard on covenant keeping, p. 110, 111.</NOTE> Three years after another of their fathers, who was mini&s;ter at Weymouth, delivered a &s;ermon before their Legi&s;lature, which he called, <HI>A plea for the life of dying religion;</HI> wherein he &s;aid, "There is already a great death upon religion, little more left than a name to live.&mdash;Con&s;ider we then how much it is dying re&s;pecting the BEING of it, by the general failure of the work of CONVER|SION; whereby ONLY it is that religion is propagat|ed, continued, and upheld in being among any people.

III. THE life of Mr. Jonathan Mitchel was pub|li&s;hed in 1697; and Dr. Increa&s;e Mather dedicated this work, which his &s;on had compiled, to the church and college at Cambridge; to whom he &s;aid, "Dr. Owen has evinced, that the letting go this principle, that particular churches ought to con&s;i&s;t of REGENE|RATE PERSONS, brought in the GREAT APOSTASY of the Chri&s;tian church. The way to prevent the like apo&s;ta&s;y in the&s;e churches, is to require an account of tho&s;e that offer them&s;elves to com|munion therein, concerning the <HI>work of God on their &s;ouls,</HI> as well as concerning their knowledge and belief.&mdash;Mr. Mitchel &s;ays, the over-enlarging of full communion, or admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons thereto, upon &s;light qualifications, without in&s;i&s;ting upon the practical and &s;piritual part of religion, will not only lo&s;e the power of godline&s;s, but in a little time bring in profanene&s;s, and ruin the churches, the&s;e two ways.

IV. IN the year 1700 Mather publi&s;hed another book, which he dedicated to the churches of Chri&s;t in New-England; to whom he &s;aid, "The Con|gregational church di&s;cipline is not &s;uited for a worldly intere&s;t, or a formal generation of profe&s;&s;ors. It will &s;tand or fall as godline&s;s, in the power of it, does prevail, or otherwi&s;e: That there is a great decay of the power of religion throughout all New-England is lamentably true; if that revive, there will be no fear of departing from the holy di&s;cipline of the churches of Chri&s;t.&mdash;If the begun apo&s;ta&s;y &s;hould proceed as fa&s;t, the next thirty years, as it has done the&s;e la&s;t, &s;urely it will come to that in New-England (except the go&s;pel it&s;elf depart with the order of it) that the mo&s;t con&s;cientious people therein will think them&s;elves concerned to gather churches out of churches." He goes on to caution and warn them again&s;t many evils; one of which is a dull formality in relations of experiences, in order for admi&s;&s;ion to communion. And he then &s;ays, "There are reports, as if in &s;ome churches per&s;ons have brought <HI>written</HI> relations, fir&s;t to the mini&s;ter and then to the church, which were not of their own dictating, but devi&s;ed by others for them. I hope the&s;e reports have nothing of truth in them; but if they have, I am &s;ure that &s;uch <HI>liars to the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> have exceedingly provoked the Lord."

<P N="5">V. MR. Willard al&s;o publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in the year 1700, intituled, <HI>The perils of the times di&s;played;</HI> in which he &s;aid, "That there is a form of godline&s;s among us is manife&s;t; but the great enquiry is, whether there be not too much of a general denying of the power of it: Whence el&s;e is it, that there be &s;uch things as the&s;e that follow to be ob&s;erved? that there is &s;uch a prevalency of &s;o many im|moralities among profe&s;&s;ors? that there is &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel? how few thorough conver|&s;ions to be ob&s;erved, how &s;carce and &s;eldom?&mdash;It hath been a frequent ob&s;ervation, that if one gene|ration begins to decline, the next that follows u&s;ually grows wor&s;e, and &s;o on, until God pours out his &s;pirit again upon them. The decays which we already langui&s;h under are &s;ad; and what tokens are on our children, that it is like to be better hereafter?

How do young profe&s;&s;ors grow weary of the &s;trict profe&s;&s;ion of their fathers, and become di&s;putants for the things which their progenitors for&s;ook a plea&s;ant land for the avoidance of?" And forty years after Mr. Prince &s;aid, "We have been generally growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e ever &s;ince<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, vol. 1. p. 100, 101, 108.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="6">VI. THE greate&s;t evils that our fathers came here to avoid, were the mixture of worthy and unworthy communicants in the churches, and the tyranny of
<PB N="26" REF="018336_0041_0FA5D3A0C844CE58">&s;ecular and mini&s;terial Courts over them; but the&s;e evils were now coming in like a &s;tood upon New-England. A church was formed in Brattle-&s;treet, Bo&s;ton, in 1699, with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of not requiring &s;uch a &s;trict profe&s;&s;ion of communicants as their fathers did. And Dr. Coleman, their mini&s;ter, was judged to have the chief hand in publi&s;hing an anonymous an&s;wer to Pre&s;ident Ma|ther's vindication of their former order. And a di&s;cour&s;e was printed in London, in 1700, wrote by Mr. Solomon Stoddard, of Northampton, where|in he blends the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ations together, in &s;uch a manner as to hold, that as all who were circumci&s;ed were obliged to keep the pa&s;&s;over, &s;o that all who were baptized ought to come to the Lord's &s;upper, yea, "Though they know them&s;elves to be in a <HI>natural condition.</HI>" And by confounding the work of Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian officers together, he a&s;&s;erted that the power of ad|mitting, cen&s;uring, and re&s;toring of members, is wholly inve&s;ted in the elders, &s;o that "The bre|thren of the church are not to intermeddle with it." When any of them, though they were unju&s;tly dealt with, they might appeal to a cla&s;&s;ical, pro|vincial and national judicature. And &s;ays he, "A national &s;ynod is the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical autho|rity upon earth.&mdash;Every man mu&s;t &s;tand to the judgment of the national &s;ynod, Deut. xvii. 12<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stoddard on in&s;tituted churches, p. 12, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 29, 33.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>THESE are the words of a mini&s;ter of great note in New-England, who&s;e doctrine has had an exten|&s;ive &s;pread therein ever &s;ince. Yet the&s;e are &s;ome of the main principles that formerly brought on the Antichri&s;tian apo&s;ta&s;y; and no text in the bible could be more aptly turned to favour their bloody per&s;ecutions, than the one here brought to prove
<PB N="27" REF="018336_0042_0FA5D3A15578FA90">his la&s;t point. For it &s;ays, <HI>The man that will do pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, and will not hearken unto the prie&s;t, or unto the judge, even that man &s;hall die.</HI> The prie&s;t was to explain God's law, and the judge was to carry the &s;ame into execution. This is the very pa&s;&s;age that the mini&s;ters brought in 1668, to prove that the Bapti&s;ts in Bo&s;ton ought to be bani&s;hed (vol. 1. p. 385.) But Dr. Owen, in his piece upon tolera|tion in 1648, truly ob&s;erved, that as God was the head and lawgiver of that nation, idolatry, bla&s;phe|my, or &s;educing of others from his wor&s;hip, were capital crimes; and that applying of tho&s;e laws to ca&s;es of wor&s;hip or di&s;cipline in other nations, with the infliction of any other puni&s;hment than death, was nothing but <HI>arbitrary</HI> proceedings. To which I may add, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ouls who are <HI>born again,</HI> are all the prie&s;ts that are named in the new te&s;tament, 1 Pet. i. 23, ii. 5, and the name is never applied therein to officers, in di&s;tinction from other &s;aints. Men who have tried to take the power of church government out of the hands of the &s;aints, in particular churches, have never been able to fix any rational bounds to it el&s;ewhere. A &s;ynod of each nation is the bounds that Mr. Stod|dard propo&s;ed in this piece, but would exclude the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops therefrom, becau&s;e they are not cho&s;en by the church, but the State<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 30.</NOTE>; but they were for other mea&s;ures.</P>

An old law was in force in Connecticut, intituled, HERETICS, which forbid any town or per&s;on to entertain any Quaker, upon penalty of Five Pounds a week, and required that they &s;hould be impri&s;oned and &s;ent out of the Colony: That none &s;hould hold unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;cour&s;e with them, upon penalty of Twenty Shillings: That none, ex|cept rulers and mini&s;ters, &s;hould keep any Quaker books, upon penalty of Ten Shillings, and that all &s;uch books &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that no ma&s;|ter of any ve&s;&s;el &s;hould land any Quakers, without carrying them away again, under the penalty of Twenty Pounds. And though this law was not rigorou&s;ly executed, yet it was not repealed; there|fore their friends in London made application, in 1704, to the Pre&s;byterian, Congregational, and Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters there, de&s;iring that as they would &s;hew them&s;elves friends to equal liberty, they would u&s;e their influence in their favour, and apply to the Queen for a repeal of &s;aid law. This was thought not to be &s;o agreeable, as to try for a reformation in New-England; and therefore &s;aid mini&s;ters in London wrote, to &s;ome mini&s;ters of influence here, a letter to be communicated to others, wherein they &s;aid, "We cannot but judge it di&s;agreeable with the &s;pirit and principles of the go&s;pel, and an encroachment upon the DIVINE PREROGATIVE and the undoubted rights of mankind, to puni&s;h any for their con&s;cientious and peaceable di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed way of religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ile they are not ju&s;tly chargeable with any immorality, or what is plainly de&s;tructive of civil &s;ociety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calamy's abridgement, p. 671.</NOTE>."

<P N="11">XI. WE mu&s;t now con&s;ider how error had a further &s;pread in this country. Mr. Stoddard publi&s;hed a &s;ermon from Exod. xii. 47, 48, where|in he &s;ays, "A mini&s;ter who knows him&s;elf unrege|nerate, may neverthele&s;s lawfully admini&s;ter bap|ti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. Men who are de&s;ti|tute of &s;aving grace may preach the go&s;pel, and therefore admini&s;ter and &s;o partake of the Lord's &s;upper." Pre&s;ident Mather an&s;wered him in 1708, when he &s;aid of this pa&s;&s;age, "I am mi&s;taken if in this logic there is not &s;ophi&s;try." But the mi&s;ery of both of them was, an entanglement in an in|con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme. The advocates for the half|way covenant in 1662 &s;aid, we know of no &s;trong|er argument for infant bapti&s;m than this, that church members are to be baptized (vol. 1, p. 335) and now Stoddard &s;ays, "The &s;acrament is a converting ordinance to church members only, and not for other men. The children of God's people &s;hould be baptized, which are generally at

<P>How imperfect is human knowledge! Stoddard publi&s;hed a reply in 1709, wherein all his argu|ments turn upon the&s;e points, viz. "That if un|&s;anctified per&s;ons might lawfully come to the pa&s;&s;over, then &s;uch may lawfully come to the Lord's &s;upper;&mdash;and they who convey to their children a right to bapti&s;m, have a right them&s;elves to the Lord's &s;upper, provided they carry inof|fen&s;ively<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appeal to the learned, p. 50, 89.</NOTE>." He could plainly &s;ee that there was no half way in the Jewi&s;h church; and his op|ponent could &s;ee as plainly, that fruits meet for repentance were required in order for bapti&s;m, even of &s;uch as were in the covenant of circumci&s;ion. But as tradition had taught them both to build the Chri&s;tian church upon that covenant, neither of them could act con&s;i&s;tently thereon; though they were two of the mo&s;t eminent mini&s;ters then in New-England. Mo&s;t of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have held fa&s;t their errors, but not their virtues. And as the&s;e things &s;hew how the churches were corrupted, &s;o what follows di&s;covers how they were en&s;laved.</P>
<P N="12">XII. THE third Governor Winthrop died Nov. 27, 1707, upon which a &s;pecial meeting of the A&s;&s;embly of Connecticut was called on December 17, to choo&s;e them another Governor. By a law then in force, he was to be elected out of a certain
<PB N="35" REF="018336_0050_0FA5D3AD75C97478">number of men in previous nomination; but they broke over tho&s;e limits, and elected an ordained mini&s;ter of New-London for their Governor; who, when they &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of it to him, readily qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed the &s;olemn charge of &s;ouls, for worldly pro|motion, and was &s;worn into his new office Jan. 1, 1708, after which they repealed the law that they had before broken, and enacted that for the future the Governor might be cho&s;en out of any of the freemen. Mr. Gurdon Salton&s;tall, &s;on to a Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts magi&s;trate, and a graduate of Har|vard college, was the Governor thus cho&s;en, and by annual elections he was continued in that office for &s;ixteen years. He was a great politician, and he exerted all his influence to rai&s;e mini&s;terial power as high as po&s;&s;ible. He took the propo&s;als of 1705, and pre&s;ented them to their Legi&s;lature, where its un&s;criptural form was &s;oon taken notice of; for there was not a text of &s;cripture in the whole &s;cheme. Perceiving that it could not be received &s;o, it was withdrawn without much noi&s;e, and the following method was taken to carry his point; an act was pa&s;&s;ed by the A&s;&s;embly that met at Hartford, May 13, 1708, which &s;ays, "This A&s;&s;embly, from their own ob&s;ervation, and from the complaint of others, being made &s;en&s;ible of the defects of the di&s;cipline of the churches of this government, ari&s;|ing from the want of a more explicit a&s;&s;erting the rules given for that end in the holy &s;criptures, from which would ari&s;e a firm e&s;tabli&s;hment among&s;t our|&s;elves, a good and regular i&s;&s;ue in ca&s;es &s;ubject to eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, glory to Chri&s;t our head, and edification to his members<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Church and State are here <HI>confounded</HI> together; as if a being members of the civil community, made men members of Chri&s;t, and he their head.</NOTE>, hath &s;een fit to

This order was obey|ed; and the mini&s;ters who met at Saybrook, Sep|tember 9, 1708, adopted the confe&s;&s;ion of faith that was compo&s;ed at the Savoy in London, 1658, and the heads of agreement entered into between Pre&s;|byterians and Independents in London, 1690, and then added fifteen articles concerning church di&s;|cipline, which were the propo&s;als of 1705 new mo|deled, with &s;cripture references annexed to each ar|ticle: Though a gentleman of that day ob&s;erved, that the text which &s;peaks of Balaam's &s;addling his a&s;s would have been as much to the purpo&s;e as many they brought. Their &s;econd article, which contains a &s;ummary of the whole &s;cheme, is in the&s;e words, viz.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e texts &s;peaks of Princes on their thrones, and not of church officers. And when we come to the antetype of Aaron and David's line, we find none therein but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and regenerate &s;ouls. Officers, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from other &s;aints in the Chri&s;tian church, are never called prie&s;ts nor Kings in the new te&s;tament. And &s;aid an eminent father of New-England, "The order of officers in the church is an order of <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> and the order of &s;aints an order of <HI>Kings</HI> (which is the highe&s;t order in the church) <HI>&s;itting upon the thrones of David for judgment,</HI> whom the mini&s;ters are to &s;erve, in guiding and going before them in, and mini&s;tring of their judgments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on again&s;t Bernard, p. 227.</NOTE>." Their &s;econd proof refers to the <HI>unity of brethren</HI> under our great High Prie&s;t, who mo&s;t explicitly excludes all &s;triv|ing about who &s;hall be the greate&s;t from his king|dom. Neither is the third text any more to their purpo&s;e. The fourth gives an account of the meet|ing of one church, at the reque&s;t of another two hundred miles off, upon a &s;pecial occa&s;ion, and not of the meeting of neighbouring churches upon all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical. The two la&s;t treat of gifts received by <HI>prophecy,</HI> and of <HI>orders</HI> given to the churches by apo&s;tolic authority; and until ordinary mini&s;ters can prove that they, as &s;uch, are Princes
<PB N="38" REF="018336_0053_0FA5D3B36F6ABF88">on their thrones, and are endowed with apo&s;tolic authority over the churches, we may &s;afely conclude, that the above application of &s;criptures was a per|verting of them from their genuine meaning and de&s;ign. Yet thereby two kinds of judicatures were &s;et up over the churches. The one called con&s;o|ciations, con&s;i&s;ting of mini&s;ters meeting in their own per&s;ons, and churches by their me&s;&s;engers, whereof each church may &s;end one or two, though the want of them is not to invalidate the acts of any Council; but none of their acts are e&s;teemed valid without the concurrence of the majority of the pa&s;|tors pre&s;ent. They are the &s;tanding council within each circuit upon all occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical, though in ca&s;es of &s;pecial difficulty they may call the next con&s;ociation to &s;it and act with them. They are to have a new choice of me&s;&s;engers and modera|tors once a year, if not oftener, and the la&s;t mode|rator is to call a new meeting when it is judged proper. Their &s;entence is to be final and deci|&s;ive. Their other judicatures are called a&s;&s;ocia|tions, which are meetings of mini&s;ters by them&s;elves in each circuit, as often as they think proper, to hear and an&s;wer questions of importance, to ex|amine and licence candidates for the mini&s;try, to receive complaints from individuals or &s;ocieties, and to direct to the calling of the Council to try the &s;ame, when they judge proper; to direct de|&s;titute churches in calling and &s;ettling of pa&s;tors, and to make complaint to their Legi&s;lature again&s;t &s;uch as they judge to be negligent of their duty in that re&s;pect. And each a&s;&s;ociation &s;ends a delegate or two to a general a&s;&s;ociation once a year, from all parts of that government.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme was not introduced without glaring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eceit: For their fourth article &s;ays, "That accord|ing

Whereas this practice was &s;o far from being <HI>com|mon,</HI> that it was an innovation then made, directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the fundamental principles of the New-England churches; as we are a&s;&s;ured by Mr. Wi&s;e, Dr. Mather, and others. No man knew better what tho&s;e principles were than Mr. Thomas Hooker, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of Hartford; and he is full in it, that though it is expedient on &s;pecial occa&s;ions to call councils or &s;ynods, yet that elders act therein as com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent, and not as pa&s;tors; and that other me&s;&s;engers &s;ent have equal power with them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Survey of church di&s;cipline, part 1. p. 119.</NOTE> Says he, "<HI>God hath &s;et officers in the church,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 28, therefore the church is before officers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 91.</NOTE>." And from Matt. xviii. 15, and 1 Cor. v. 12, he con|cludes, "That each man and member of the &s;oci|ety, in a ju&s;t way, may be directed, cen&s;ured, re|formed, or removed, by the power of the whole, and each may and &s;hould <HI>judge</HI> with the con&s;ent of the whole: This belongs to all the members, and therefore to any that &s;hall be in office, if they be members.

And he ob&s;erves, that to remove the power of

Says he, "The truth is, <HI>a particular congregation is the highe&s;t tribunal,</HI> unto which the grieved party may appeal in the third place, if private council, or the witne&s;&s;es of two, have &s;eemed to proceed too &s;harply.

Yet now the churches were not allowed the power to &s;ay whether their mi|ni&s;ters &s;hould meet at Saybrook, or not; and the re|&s;ult of their meeting being laid before the Legi&s;lature of October 14, 1708, they &s;aid, "This A&s;&s;embly do declare their great approbation of &s;uch a happy agreement, and do ordain that all the churches with|in this government, that are or &s;hall be thus united, in doctrine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, be, and for the future &s;hall be owned and acknowledged e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.

Thus artfully was this new &s;cheme e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all others declared to be no more than allowed or tolerated.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. MR. John Woodward, another Cam|bridge &s;cholar, was then mini&s;ter of Norwich;

For this the mini&s;ter and his party cen|&s;ured them; an account of which being &s;ent to the next meeting of the A&s;&s;embly, they were ex|pelled thereform. Hereby we may &s;ee how far corruption had prevailed in our land. For in 1641, three years after the fir&s;t taxing law for mini&s;ters was made in New-England, a law was made at Bo&s;ton, which &s;aid, "No church cen&s;ure &s;hall degrade or depo&s;e any man from any civil dignity, office or authority, he &s;hall have in the Common|wealth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts law-book, printed 1672, p. 44.</NOTE>." How much more equitable was this, than another law in Connecticut? which &s;aid, "What&s;oever per&s;ons &s;hall on the Lord's day, under any pretence what&s;oever, a&s;&s;emble them|&s;elves together in any of the public meeting-hou&s;es, provided in any town, pari&s;h or &s;ociety, for the public wor&s;hip of God, without leave or allowance of the mini&s;ter and congregation for who&s;e u&s;e it was provided, and be thereof convict, every &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall incur the penalty of Ten Shillings for every &s;uch offence.

But not long after Norwich mini|&s;ter had cen&s;ured their repre&s;entatives, he con&s;ent|ed to refer the matter to a Council; and they fol|lowed it, with Council after Council, for about &s;ix years. Governor Salton&s;tall came there him&s;elf upon one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions; and Mr. Stoddard of Northampton was moderator of the la&s;t but one of tho&s;e Councils. My grandfather went a journey as far as Bo&s;ton and Ip&s;wich, an hundred and thirty miles, to con&s;ult with Mr. Wi&s;e and the two Mather's upon the&s;e affairs. At la&s;t, by advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Council that met Augu&s;t 31, 1716, &s;aid mini&s;ter was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the church in Norwich deter|mined to abide upon their ancient foundation. And it was known, that when the church was con&s;tituted at Saybrook in 1660, with the approbation of other mini&s;ters, Mr. James Fitch was ordained their pa&s;|tor, by the laying on of the hands only of their two deacons, as a token that the power of ordination is in the church as a body. They came and planted Norwich the &s;ame year; and Mr. Fitch was con|tinued one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful mini&s;ters in Connec|ticut for near fifty years. The church in Ea&s;t-Wind&s;or, under the care of Mr. Timothy Edwards, father of Mr. Jonathan, al&s;o refu&s;ed to receive the Saybrook platform. And the temper of tho&s;e who introduced it farther appears by the incorpora|ting act of the town of Killingly, pa&s;&s;ed in May, 1708; which &s;ays, "No per&s;on now inhabiting on &s;aid lands, or any other per&s;ons dwelling without this Colony, who have purcha&s;ed any lands within the &s;aid town&s;hip, that &s;hall not give due obedience to all the laws of this Colony for the upholding the wor&s;hip of God, and paying all public charges,
<PB N="43" REF="018336_0058_0FA5D3B72EB4F478">&s;hall have any benefit by this act." At the &s;ame time they gave their Governor two hundred acres of land therein. This account is carefully taken from their public records and laws, and other au|thentic vouchers.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. A FEW things concerning bapti&s;m &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter. An aged and honorable gen|tleman near Pi&s;cataqua river informed me, that about the year 1710, a number of people in Dover<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Han&s;ard Knollys was mini&s;ter there, from the &s;pring of 1638 to the fall of 1641, vol. 1, p. 101.</NOTE> were &s;o fully per&s;uaded that they ought, in a li|teral &s;en&s;e, to be buried in bapti&s;m, that on a Lord's day, and the day after, Mr. Pike, their mini&s;ter, baptized nine per&s;ons in that way, in a branch of that river. But &s;uch a noi&s;e was made, and oppo&s;ition rai&s;ed again&s;t it, as prevented any further proceedings therein. About the &s;ame time a Bapti&s;t meeting was &s;et up at Scituate, in the county of Plymouth, where Pre&s;ident Dun&s;ter &s;pent his latter days to good purpo&s;e (vol. 1, p. 320.) Mr. John Peirce preached to them for &s;ome time, until he and others removed to Swanzey, in or about 1711, and on October 19, 1715, he was ordained a pa&s;tor of the &s;econd church there, col|league with Elder Jo&s;eph Ma&s;on, who was ordained in July, 1709. And they continued in good e&s;teem in their offices, until Elder Ma&s;on died, May 19, 1748, and Elder Peirce September 8, 1750, be|ing each of them near 90 years old. On March 16, 1714, Dr. Cotton Mather wrote the letter to the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, which is in vol. 1, p. 522; &s;ub&s;cribed thus, viz. "To my worthy friend, Mr. Ellis Callender, elder of a church of Chri&s;t in Bo&s;ton." He joined to it in 1669; was a leading member of it when the Court nailed up
<PB N="44" REF="018336_0059_0FA5D3B7E9C3BA08">their meeting-hou&s;e in 1680; and he was continued a great ble&s;&s;ing to them until he died in a good old age, after the year 1726.</P>

<P N="1">I.

And his &s;on Jo&s;eph was a teacher among them in Tiverton for many years, who&s;e daughter Richard|&s;on told me, that, during Governor Dudley's ad|mini&s;tration, her father was frequently &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, to defend his town again&s;t the arbitrary claims of other mini&s;ters; and that the Governor privately favoured him therein. Some extracts from the records of the Quaker &s;ociety &s;hew, that in 1707 a cow, worth Three Pounds, was taken
<PB N="45" REF="018336_0060_0FA5D3B8A8EF1488"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om John Packom, of Little-Compton, for a mini|&s;terial tax of Six Shillings and Twopence. And that their monthly meeting on Rhode-I&s;land, in the &s;eventh month, 1708, &s;ent Jo&s;eph Wanton with an addre&s;s to Governor Dudley, "De&s;iring relief from &s;ufferings for prie&s;ts rates, by a repeal of tho&s;e laws;" informing him that if it was not done here, they thought it their duty to addre&s;s the Briti&s;h Court upon it. A like application was afterwards made by the hand of Ebenezer Slocum, who reported to a meeting in 1709, that the Governor appeared kind and friendly; but as no relief was granted, they then &s;ent to England upon tho&s;e matters. By the &s;ame records we are informed, that in 1716, five cows and calves, worth Twenty-five Pounds, were taken from Peleg Slocum, and twenty-four &s;heep, worth Eight Pounds Eight Shillings, from John and Abra|ham Tucker, all upon Slocum's I&s;land, and near all for "A demand of Prie&s;t Holmes, of Chilmark," to which town &s;aid i&s;land belonged, although the great channel betwixt the main and Martha's Vineyard mu&s;t be cro&s;&s;ed to get to it. However, mini&s;ters were far from being content with all the power they had yet obtained, and therefore pre&s;ented a petition to their Legi&s;lature, that they would call a general &s;ynod; doubtle&s;s to revi&s;e and carry into effect the propo&s;als of 1705.

<P>IT was re-printed accordingly; and, with Mr. Wi&s;e's other works, it had two editions more in 1773, upon an occa&s;ion which will then be mention|ed. The&s;e two mini&s;ters lived to &s;ee and rejoice in the glorious work of divine grace, which was grant|ed in New-England, in and after the year 1740. Mr. Moody was mini&s;ter at York, beyond Pi&s;cata|qua river. He preached without notes, and refu|&s;ed to be &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion; and was the mo&s;t powerful and &s;ucce&s;sful preacher of almo&s;t any in the land in tho&s;e days. Such oppo|&s;ition was rai&s;ed again&s;t Governor Dudley, that he was removed, and never acted with our Legi&s;lature after Augu&s;t, 1715; and when they met again No|vember 23, with the pliant Lieutenant-Governor Taylor in the chair, the following act was added to their other taxing laws, viz.</P>

V. PRESIDENT Mather publi&s;hed another piece in 1716, wherein he &s;ays, "For mini&s;ters to pre|tend to a negative voice in Synods, or for Councils to take upon them to determine what elders or me&s;&s;engers a church &s;hall &s;ubmit unto, without the choice of the church concerned, or for mini&s;ters to pretend to be members of a Council without any mi&s;&s;ion from their churches, nay, although the church declares that they will not &s;end them, is <HI>prelatical,</HI> and e&s;&s;entially differing not only from Congregational, but from Pre&s;byterian principles. And now that I am going out of the world, I could not die in peace, if I did not di&s;charge my con|&s;cience, in bearing witne&s;s again&s;t &s;uch innovations and inva&s;ions on the rights and privileges belong|ing to particular congregations of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;qui&s;ition concerning Eccl. Councils, preface, p. 13.</NOTE>." Yet all the&s;e innovations and inva&s;ions were made in the Saybrook &s;cheme. And to &s;hew that brethren, when cho&s;en by the church, have a right to equal votes in Councils with elders, he &s;ays, "There are mechanics, who although they do not excel in that which is called <HI>human learning,</HI> are well ver&s;ed and learned in the &s;criptures, &s;pending much time in con&s;ulting tho&s;e oracles of God, and being men of great piety, and excellent natural accompli&s;h|ments, they may be very u&s;eful in Synods."</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL hi&s;torians give a remarkable account of what happened in the Nicene Synod. "A pious old man, who was no clergyman, nor ex|erci&s;ed philo&s;ophical notions, by his plain di&s;cour&s;e did more towards the conviction of an heretical phi|lo&s;opher, than all the learned bi&s;hops in the Council could do<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Di&s;qui&s;ition, p. 19.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="50" REF="018336_0065_0FA5D3BE91097EF8">
VI. THESE things naturally led him and his brethren into another &s;ort of behaviour towards the Bapti&s;ts, than when he was &s;cribe of the Synod of 1679, who declared that they were &s;etting up their po&s;ts by God's po&s;ts; which moved the Court to nail up the doors of the Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e. For Elder Callender's &s;on Eli&s;ha was added to the church under his care, on Augu&s;t 10, 1713; after which he was educated at Harvard college, and called into the go&s;pel mini&s;try; and as Pre&s;ident Mather had expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s for &s;uch a thing to Elder Callender, his church called the Pre&s;ident, his &s;on, and Mr. John Webb, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ordaining Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender, as pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, May 21, 1718. And Dr. Cotton Mather, in the ordination &s;ermon, &s;aid, "It is very &s;adly true, that many eccle&s;ia&s;tical communities, wherein piety has its votaries, yet are guilty of this evil, that they impo&s;e terms of com|munion which many that have the fear of God are by ju&s;t exceptions kept from complying withal. Now in this unhappy ca&s;e what is to be done? do this, let good men go as far as they can without &s;in in holding communion with one another. But where &s;inful terms are impo&s;ed, there let them make their &s;tops; there a &s;eparation becomes a duty; there the injunction of heaven upon them is, <HI>be ye &s;eparate &s;aith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</HI> The <HI>impo&s;ers</HI> are the <HI>&s;chi&s;matics.</HI> There have been many attempts to unite people in forms and terms, that are not the pure maxims of living unto God; and &s;o to build the tower of Zion on a foundation which is not the <HI>tried &s;tone and the precious,</HI> and &s;o not the <HI>&s;ure foundation.</HI> There has hitherto been a bla&s;t from heaven upon all the&s;e attempts; they have mi&s;carried, as being rather cal|culated
<PB N="51" REF="018336_0066_0FA5D3BEB2D62CE8">for the tower of Babel. New-England al&s;o has in &s;ome former times done &s;omething of this a&s;|pect, which would not now be &s;o well approved of; in which, if the <HI>brethren, in who&s;e hou&s;e</HI> we are now convened, met with any thing too <HI>unbrotherly,</HI> they now with &s;atisfaction hear us expre&s;&s;ing our di&s;like of every thing that looked like <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> in the days that have pa&s;&s;ed over us." (See vol. 1, p. 523&mdash;525.)</P>
<P N="7">VII. THE ca&s;e of a member, who &s;oon after joined to that church, I think proper here to men|tion. Samuel Jennings, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was born in Sand|wich, in the county of Barn&s;table, February 19&punc; 1685, where he lived till he was above 18 years old, and then went a voyage to &s;ea, where he was pre&s;&s;ed on board a man of war. But meeting with very ill treatment there for five months, he in the evening of March 26, 1704, the &s;hip being in a bay at Bar|bados, attempted to make his e&s;cape therefrom by &s;wimming; but by the way he was &s;eized and halled under water by a &s;hark; a terrible ca&s;e indeed! yet as he cried to God for help, the venomous crea|ture let him go, and his life was pre&s;erved, with the lo&s;s only of part of a foot and an arm. He return|ed, married, and lived in good repute in his native town, which he repre&s;ented &s;everal times in our Legi&s;lature. after he had &s;erved them two years in that office, he wrote as follows concerning his &s;oul affairs. Says he, "Though I had heard much preaching, and read many books, to &s;upport the baptizing of infants, and had never read any books, or di&s;cour&s;ed on that head with any that were again&s;t it, yet I found &s;o much in the &s;cripture to the contrary, that I could not believe it to be right. Notwith&s;tanding I went to &s;everal mini&s;ters, and di&s;cour&s;ed them on that point to get light, and al&s;o prayed to God to direct me in the right way; yet
<PB N="52" REF="018336_0067_0FA5D3BF5B1D6030">&s;till it appeared to me un&s;criptural and erroneous. Then I went to Mr. Callender, the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter at Bo&s;ton, who not only di&s;cour&s;ed with me, but lent me books &s;et out by tho&s;e of his per&s;ua&s;ion, to &s;up|port the truth thereof; which when I had read, I found &s;o agreeable with the &s;criptures, and with the apprehen&s;ions I before had from them, that I quickly fought to be admitted into the communion of that church at Bo&s;ton. And having made a ver|bal profe&s;&s;ion, before the church and congregation, I was baptized (that is dipped in the water) by Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender, mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, on the 9th day of June, 1718, in the 34th year of my age. And truly I may &s;ay, as is &s;aid of the Ethiopian eu|nuch, that I came away rejoicing. In a &s;hort time after I arrived to a con&s;iderable degree of bodily health, which I had lacked for eight years before." He &s;erved his town afterwards as their repre&s;enta|tive, and in other offices; and, without his &s;eeking, a commi&s;&s;ion of Ju&s;tice of the Peace was &s;ent him, which, for &s;ome rea&s;ons, he cho&s;e not to accept. He continued a member of &s;aid church in Bo&s;ton till his death in 1764.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. SOON after Mr. Callender was ordained, he opened a corre&s;pondence with friends in London, which, with other means, had very great and ex|ten&s;ive effects. Thomas Hollis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the mo&s;t liberal men upon earth, had &s;ome acquaint|ance with Pre&s;ident Mather, when he was agent for this Province in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I.

<SALUTE>Much e&s;teemed Brother Callender,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you kindly, for the particular ac|count you gave me in your la&s;t; and I cannot but lament the &s;ad con&s;equences of &s;in, and the great degrees of it which remain, even in God's own people; for &s;urely the greate&s;t part, if not all tho&s;e who &s;uffered &s;o much for their religion at home, and at la&s;t left their native country, and run &s;uch great hazards as they did, for the &s;ake of their con&s;ciences, mu&s;t, in the judgment of charity, be e&s;teemed the faithful &s;ervants of Chri&s;t. But when I con&s;ider the methods which the&s;e who differed from them in matters not fundamental, I cannot but wonder at the depth of folly which remains with us, that any body of men &s;hould &s;o &s;oon and &s;o zealou&s;ly pur&s;ue tho&s;e very methods which they had &s;o ju&s;tly condemned, and &s;o greatly &s;uffered by! It is a con&s;ideration enough to check the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the apo&s;toli|cal advice, let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall; for I think we are but too &s;ubject to the le&s;&s;er degrees of this temper and carriage, in almo&s;t every &s;tation of life. For though there is &s;o
<PB N="54" REF="018336_0069_0FA5D3C1A644FF40">good an under&s;tanding among the three denomina|tions of di&s;&s;enters, viz.

As to the method of educating youth among you, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the de&s;ign &s;eemed to be well laid for promoting u&s;eful know|ledge; and I hope your college will be improved to a very great advantage; but I find you have to lament, what we are not &s;trangers to, viz. that tho&s;e things which in them&s;elves are good, and tend to fit per&s;ons for more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, are made nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on in order to the mini&s;try, or &s;hould be thought, at any time, to be a &s;ufficient qualification for &s;o great a work. Surely a man ble&s;&s;ed with a good natural genius, who has been brought to a true &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and the &s;aving know|ledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though he &s;hould want the advantage of human literature, mu&s;t be better ca|pable than one that has it, and is de&s;titute of the other, to guide &s;ouls into the ways of &s;alvation; becau&s;e as he knows &s;omething of the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, and the wiles of Satan, &s;o he is more capa|ble to comfort poor &s;ouls in di&s;tre&s;s, with the com|forts wherewith he him&s;elf has been comforted of God. Therefore, though I have a high e&s;teem for human learning, and wi&s;h every mini&s;ter had the advantage of a good degree of it, yet I con|ceive it is far from being nece&s;&s;ary to a man's being employed in the public mini&s;try, and much le&s;s do I think it in it&s;elf a qualification &s;ufficient for &s;o weighty an undertaking. You will excu&s;e me for &s;o freely declaring my mind upon this head.</P>

<P>"I received the honor of the church's and your letter together, by Capt. Lawrence. After I had a little con&s;idered the contents of both, I waited up|on our honored friend, Mr. Thomas Hollis, with the ca&s;e, with whom I left it; and &s;ome little time after he told me, that him&s;elf and brother, Mr. John Hollis, would advance &s;ome money to repair your meeting-hou&s;e, upon condition I would pre|vail with my brethren, concerned in our little fund, to make a pre&s;ent to Mr. Callender, as a token of our Chri&s;tian re&s;pects to him.

<P>CONCERNING the &s;tate of the Arian controver|&s;y with us, and our mini&s;ter's concern therein, I &s;hall briefly relate the whole as follows. Some few years ago one Dr. Clark, of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, a gentleman of de&s;erved reputation, wrote a book, intituled, <HI>The &s;cripture doctrine of the Trinity;</HI> in which he endeavours (after very high expre&s;&s;ions of the dig|nity of the Redeemer's per&s;on and nature) to deny him to be a nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-exi&s;tent being; which is con&s;trued by his adver&s;aries as a con&s;equential de|nying his proper divinity, and a degrading our Sa|viour into a &s;ubordinate God, notwith&s;tanding all he hath offered in honor to this hope of a true Chri&s;tian. This made a great &s;tir, and &s;et many pens to work; &s;ome for and &s;ome again&s;t the Doc|tor's notions, among &s;everal of note in the church of England, and others; &s;ome of whom I think carried the point much further than the Doctor ap|pears to have de&s;igned. I wi&s;h the conte&s;t had always continued in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; but a little time carried it among the di&s;&s;enters, and one Mr. Peirce, a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter, of ingenuity and con&s;iderable note, among others, e&s;pou&s;ed Dr. Clark's notions openly (if he went no further.) The debates, pro and con, began to be managed with warmth, not only in the city, but in divers parts of the country. But Mr. Peirce being a man of &s;o much note, and a mini&s;ter in the city of Exeter, where the Pre&s;|byterian intere&s;t is in much credit, he was the fir&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="018336_0075_0FA5D3C8990AFED8">per&s;on who was very publicly noted among the di&s;&s;enters. His people (after &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and &s;everal methods u&s;ed to accommodate mat|ters) propo&s;ed parting with him, as a man not &s;ound in the faith. This occa&s;ioned each party to advi&s;e with their friends in the mini&s;try, and others, what to do in the ca&s;e. Some of the per&s;ons wrote to upon this account (which were not a few) thought that Mr. Peirce had given too much cau&s;e for his people to believe that he had departed from the or|thodox faith, in relation to the doctrine of the Trinity. Others, though they did not deny this, yet apprehended his people had not dealt &s;o kind|ly by him in this matter as they ought to have done, by a man of his character and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was &s;ome time before a committee of mini&s;ters and gentlemen of the three denomina|tions in London, to &s;ee if they could find a way to accommodate matters at Exeter, and prevent divi|&s;ions upon the &s;ame account in other places; but they were not all of one mind. Then the whole body of mini&s;ters in and about London was called together, and a paper of advices propo&s;ed to be con&s;idered of in order to &s;ign, for accommodating matters at Exeter. Some of the mini&s;ters, who were zealou&s;ly concerned for the doctrine of the Trinity, at the &s;ame time propo&s;ed, that a declara|tion of our faith, with re&s;pect to that important doc|trine of the Chri&s;tian religion, &s;hould be &s;igned, and &s;ent down with the advices; but, upon a divi|&s;ion of the mini&s;ters, it was rejected by a majority of about five per&s;ons. It was then agreed at the next meeting to con&s;ider the paper of advices, paragraph by paragraph; at which meeting were about one hundred and thirty mini&s;ters of the three denomina|tions, who placed your poor friend in the chair.
<PB N="61" REF="018336_0076_0FA5D3CA22439F28">That part who were again&s;t &s;igning a declaration of faith, as above, earne&s;tly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ted upon proceeding directly to read the paper of advices, as &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the immediate work of the meeting; the other &s;ide propo&s;ed that article in the church of England which relates to the doctrine of the Trinity, and tho&s;e an&s;wers in the a&s;&s;embly's cate|chi&s;m to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to be &s;ub&s;cribed by the London mini&s;ters, before they proceeded to con|&s;ider the paper of advices. Warm debates there were indeed for two or three hours, when on a &s;ud|den tho&s;e brethren who re&s;olved to &s;ub&s;cribe tho&s;e articles withdrew into the gallery; which, however ju&s;t their zeal might be for the truth contended for, was not looked upon as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the breaking up the meeting at that time. So, after &s;ome me&s;&s;ages &s;ent from the one part to the other, tho&s;e above proceeded to &s;ub&s;cribe tho&s;e articles, as con|taining their &s;entiments of the doctrine of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity; and the other proceeded to con|&s;ider the paper of advices, and drew up a general article of their faith as to that doctrine, which was &s;igned by their moderator by appointment. This they &s;ent to Exeter; while the others drew up another &s;et of advices, and &s;ent down with the arti|cles they had &s;ub&s;cribed, and henceforward we came under the di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of &s;ub&s;cri|bers and non-&s;ub&s;cribers, which di&s;tinction I fear will be too long remembered by us, for the com|mon benefit of true religion.</P>
<P>SOME of the too warm among the non-&s;ub&s;cri|bers would fain fix the odious charge of <HI>per&s;ecu|tion</HI> on the other, while they again, with full as much warmth, would fix the charge of <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> upon them. But this &s;everity is not allowed, by the greate&s;t part of either &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and
<PB N="62" REF="018336_0077_0FA5D3CBC2F73B48">I hope time will produce a better temper in both parties; but at pre&s;ent the matter is not accommo|dated, nor &s;o good a harmony among the mini&s;ters as could be heartily wi&s;hed. As I am &s;atisfied that &s;ome among the non-&s;ub&s;cribers are gone too far into &s;ome of the di&s;tinctive notions of Arius, &s;o I think &s;ome of the &s;ub&s;cribers have given too much ground of jealou&s;y, that they intended to &s;et up tho&s;e forms as a te&s;t of arthodoxy, and the &s;ign|ing of them as nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ons being accepta|ble and u&s;eful in the mini&s;try. But I dare &s;ay, for the much greater part of both &s;ides, that they intended no evil to their differing brethren; and that it was a zeal for the doctrine of the Trinity, and the real divinity of our Saviour, which made &s;ome &s;ub&s;cribe the articles, and not any de&s;ire to impo&s;e upon others; and that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed the &s;ub|&s;cription, did it with a de&s;ign to maintain Chri&s;tian liberty, rather than any de&s;ign to encourage or promote Ariani&s;m. There is no great difference in the number of either &s;ide; but I think there are not &s;o many of our denomination among the non-&s;ub&s;cribers as are on the other &s;ide; and though I cannot &s;ay that there are none of our mini&s;ters who too much favour the new &s;cheme, yet I may venture to &s;ay in general, that our mini&s;ters, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the particular denomination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. holding to particular election.</NOTE>, are &s;ound in the faith, as to the real divinity of Chri&s;t, and the true doctrine of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity. Therefore tho&s;e who upbraid you with their being contrary, act either from prejudice or mi&s;informa|tion. But &s;uch have been the vi&s;ible con&s;equences of this difference, that brotherly love and charity, that indi&s;pen&s;able ornament of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, have been greatly lo&s;t in the debates.

<P N="9">IX. MR. James Peirce, above referred to, was ejected from his church, in March, 1719; but a party followed him, and built another meeting-hou&s;e for him, in the city of Exeter; to encourage whom, he declared his expectation, that by what they &s;uffered, "The &s;pirit of impo&s;ition and per|&s;ecution would be rendered more odious." And he accu&s;ed that church of attempting to &s;et up an INQUISITION, only becau&s;e they brought on &s;uch a trial as con&s;trained him to own his new opi|nions, which cau&s;ed his removal from a profitable living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His works, printed 1728, p. 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 136.</NOTE>. Mr. Benjamin Wallin, &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in office to Mr. Edward, publi&s;hed an excellent little volume upon the SONSHIP OF CHRIST in 1771, wherein he informs us, that ever &s;ince the above mentioned time, creeds and catechi&s;ms have been cried down, and a regular Chri&s;tian educa|tion much neglected, under a pretence of rea&s;on and liberty. And America has been much in|fected with the &s;ame di&s;temper. But it is not all traditions and human creeds that &s;uch men reject, as the following extract from Peirce plainly &s;hews. Under an appearance of a great regard to the &s;crip|tures, he publi&s;hed a catechi&s;m, wherein the an|&s;wers were in &s;cripture words; part of which &s;ay, "Q. How many Gods are there? A. There is one God. Q. Who is this God? A. Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom
<PB N="64" REF="018336_0079_0FA5D3CCDBF91260">are all things, and we <HI>for</HI> him. One God and Fa|ther of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, 1 Cor. viii. 5, 6, Eph. iv. 6." Which creed is &s;o far from delivering any from the tyranny of human inventions, that where the &s;cripture puts no more than a &s;emicolon between the mention of the Father and the Son, Peirce puts a period, and three pages in his book. And when he comes to &s;peak of the Son, he picks out words that &s;peak of his &s;ubjection and obedience to the Father; ex|cluding tho&s;e which a&s;&s;ert his equality with him, which are many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Peirce's works, p. 352, 418&mdash;422.</NOTE>. Whereas, if we leave out the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time, and the mode or manner wherein earthly relations commence, which have no place in the Deity, it is ea&s;y to conceive of a Father and Son of equal capacity and excellency; with &s;uch an onene&s;s in nature, and peculiarity of relation, as no others have: And al&s;o that one may, by vo|luntary contract, &s;ubject him&s;elf to another for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, and take upon him the <HI>form of a &s;ervant,</HI> and yet remain perfectly equal in nature. How unrea&s;onable then are tho&s;e great pretenders to rea|&s;on, who profe&s;s to take the &s;criptures as their rule, and yet reject all tho&s;e truths therein, which cro&s;s their darling notions! Tho&s;e who are convinced of the infinite evil of &s;in, &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of infi|nite merit to remove their guilt, and infinite power to change their hearts and lives, and to guide them to glory.

And in a letter to Mr. Callender of February 8, 1721-2, Mr. Wallen &s;aid, "I congratulate my friend upon his admitment to the honor of an over&s;eer of the college.

But we are inform|ed by the late Mr. Condy, that Dr. Sewal, at the head of other mini&s;ters, po&s;itively denied him a &s;eat there.

One curious event then happened there which I &s;hall mention.

Many young people in Bo&s;|ton were turned to a &s;erious regard for religion al&s;o in 1721. The &s;mall-pox coming there in April, and prevailing mo&s;t terribly through the year, had a deep effect upon many &s;ouls.

Having a great inclination for learn|ing, he, by Pre&s;ident Mather's influence, was taken from an apprentice&s;hip to a trade, and put to &s;chool, in December, 1720. Serious turns of concern about his &s;oul had been frequent with him for &s;everal years; which greatly increa&s;ed for &s;eventeen days after he had taken that infection. "Nothing, &s;ays he, but the gho&s;tly countenance of death un|prepared for was before me, and no &s;ight of a re|conciled God, nor any &s;en&s;e of the application of the &s;oul-clean&s;ing blood of Chri&s;t to my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oul: I remained in extreme terror until Novem|ber 22. All the interval of time I &s;pent in looking over the affairs of my &s;oul; and on that day I was taken &s;ick. As &s;oon as it was told me that the di&s;|temper appeared, all my fears entirely vani&s;hed, and
<PB N="67" REF="018336_0082_0FA5D3CF146279B0">a beam of comfort darted into my &s;oul, and with it &s;atisfaction from the&s;e words, <HI>Thou &s;halt not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</HI> Yea, &s;o great was my &s;atisfaction, that immediately I repli|ed, to my aunt who informed me, then I know I &s;hall not die now; but gave no rea&s;on why I &s;aid &s;o." He recovered, and afterwards became a Bap|ti&s;t mini&s;ter; and his ingenious diary and papers have furni&s;hed many valuable materials for our hi&s;tory. Ephraim Crafts, one of his young brethren, was baptized and added to that church in Bo&s;ton, January 27, 1723, John Dabney, from London, had been received by them December 4, 1720, and Richard Bevens, from Wales, the next Augu&s;t, who were members of Bapti&s;t churches before they came here. Other members from Europe were added to them, both before and &s;ince.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. EQUAL religious liberty, by virtue of a &s;pecial act, was enjoyed in Bo&s;ton; but was &s;o much denied in the country, that mo&s;t of the Bapti&s;ts had no heart to &s;end their &s;ons to Har|vard college; though a few of them did &s;o, whereby they made &s;ome u&s;e of Mr. Hollis's donations there. Great pains were taken to compel every town to re|ceive and &s;upport &s;uch mini&s;ters as the Court called orthodox. A law was al&s;o made at Bo&s;ton, in the May &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1718, to tax all to the building and repairing of pari&s;h meeting-hou&s;es. In 1717 the pious and judicious Elder Luther fell a&s;leep, leav|ing the care of the fir&s;t church in Swanzey to Elder Ephraim Wheaton, who had been a colleague with
<PB N="69" REF="018336_0084_0FA5D3D482129FD8">him about thirteen years. The &s;econd church in Swanzey had then two ordained pa&s;tors; yet in April, 1719, their Select-Men were convented before Bri&s;tol Court, "For not having a mini&s;ter according to the law of the Province." But upon proving that Elder Wheaton was their lawful mini&s;ter, they were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. "Paying co&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;tol Court records.</NOTE>." His meeting-hou&s;e &s;tood near the borders of Rehoboth; and he and many of his people who lived therein were taxed to Pedo|bapti&s;t mini&s;ters of that town, of which we &s;hall hear more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P N="2">II. FREETOWN, which lies on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the great river again&s;t Swanzey, met with wor&s;e treat|ment than they did. For on September 9, 1717, they made choice of Thomas Craghead, a mini&s;ter from Ireland, for their pa&s;tor; and he accepted of their call: But in&s;tead of an amicable agreement with them about his &s;upport, he went in January, 1718, and procured an act of Bri&s;tol Court, to com|pel Freetown to pay him a &s;alary of Sixty-five Pounds a year, to begin from the day he was cho|&s;en their mini&s;ter. And for refu&s;ing to pay it, about fourteen of the inhabitants were &s;eized and impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol; one of whom was Benjamin Cha&s;e, a member of a Bapti&s;t church in Newport. In April, 1719, each party carried witne&s;&s;es about the&s;e matters to Bri&s;tol Court; but the Court di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them all, and required the town to obey their former order. In 1720 Thomas Gage and George Win&s;low, their Select-Men, were fined Forty Shil|lings a piece for not a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Craghead's &s;alary. At la&s;t he was defeated in a trial at law, and was forced to quit the town; but the&s;e broils produced great and la&s;ting evils therein. Little-Compton had &s;ettled a legal mini&s;ter; and as Elder Tabor
<PB N="70" REF="018336_0085_0FA5D3D614071340">owned &s;ome land in that town, he was taxed to him; for which a riding-&s;addle was taken from Tabor, as a per&s;on informed me who &s;aw it.</P>
<P N="3">III. TIVERTON and Dartmouth were the only remaining towns in the Province which had not yielded to the ruling party about wor&s;hip. When orders for that purpo&s;e had come from their Courts, they had reported, that Jo&s;eph Wanton was the mini&s;ter of Tiverton, and Elder Tabor the mini&s;ter of the we&s;t part of Dartmouth, and another man for the ea&s;t part. But as the Court did not e&s;teem them to be orthodox, a complaint again&s;t tho&s;e towns was pre&s;ented to their Legi&s;lature in 1722; who annexed &s;uch &s;ums as they thought proper for the purpo&s;e to their Province tax. This being heard of, their Select-Men refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;e&s;s it; for which two of them out of each town were &s;eized on May 25, 1723, and were impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol. Here|upon Thomas Richard&s;on, who married friend Wanton's daughter, was &s;ent over to London; and with Richard Partridge, Agent for Rhode-I&s;land Colony, pre&s;ented a memorial to the King in Coun|cil; wherein they ob&s;erved, that our charter allows equal liberty of con&s;cience to all Chri&s;tians except Papi&s;ts; and that neither the charter nor any law had e&s;tabli&s;hed any te&s;t of orthodoxy in this Province, only as Pre&s;byterians and Independents had &s;et up their major votes as &s;uch; whereby di&s;&s;enters from them were frequently brought under great &s;uffer|ings; from which no redre&s;s could be obtained here, "The A&s;&s;embly always oppo&s;ing whatever the Governor and Council were at any time di&s;po&s;ed to do on that behalf." And as the King, at his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the throne, promi&s;ed protection and liber|ty of con&s;cience to all his di&s;&s;enting &s;ubjects without exception, they prayed that he would denounce his
<PB N="71" REF="018336_0086_0FA5D3D69521BAA0">negative upon tho&s;e laws or parts of laws among us, that interfered therewith, and al&s;o order tho&s;e pri&s;oners to be relea&s;ed. A committee was ap|pointed upon the ca&s;e, who&s;e report with the act of Council thereon are as follow:</P>

<P>MR. Dummer, in a letter to the Board of Trade, endeavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by ob&s;erving, that a like vote of the Council upon a like petition was pa&s;&s;ed in 1715, which was never cen&s;ured from home as he knew of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dougla&s;s, vol. 2, p. 337, 378.</NOTE>. But then it was not coun|tenanced by the other branches of the Legi&s;la|ture, as this was. The mini&s;ter who, in behalf of the re&s;t, &s;igned the above petition for a Synod, pub|li&s;hed a book in 1726, wherein he promi&s;es a faith|ful account of the di&s;cipline of the New-England churches. Much of it was written many years be|fore, and an atte&s;tation was prefixed to it by Dr. Increa&s;e Mather, dated December 10, 1719. After &s;ixty-&s;ix years labour in the great work of the mi|ni&s;try he fell a&s;leep, Augu&s;t 23, 1723, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t. 85. Though he was a friend to Councils and Synods, yet he te&s;tified again&s;t giving them &s;uch power as his &s;on and many more wanted. But he and others
<PB N="77" REF="018336_0092_0FA5D3DD7545F850">being removed, their children renewed their at|tempts for that power. His &s;on had a &s;trong affec|tion for the propo&s;als of 1705, and for Gov. Salton|&s;tall, who procured the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that &s;cheme in Connecticut; even &s;o that when Salton&s;tall died in 1724, Mather preached a funeral &s;ermon for him at Bo&s;ton, an hundred miles off, and got it printed at New-London. He al&s;o now di&s;covered his re&s;ent|ment again&s;t Mr. Wi&s;e, for writing again&s;t &s;aid pro|po&s;als<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ratio di&s;ciplinae fratrum Nov. Anglorum, p. 184.</NOTE>. And having declared that four Synods had been called by authority in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, he &s;ays, "The Synods of New-England know no weapons, but what are <HI>purely &s;piritual.</HI> They have no &s;ecular arm to enforce any canons; they a&s;k none, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey want none. And they cannot believe, that any Prote&s;tant &s;ecular arm would, upon due information, any more forbid their meetings, than they would any of the religious a&s;&s;emblies upheld in the country<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 172, 173.</NOTE>." Had this been true, we have no rea&s;on to think that their meetings would have been forbidden. But plain facts &s;hew, that the immedi|ate effect of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e Synods was the di&s;|&s;olving of a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives (who would not puni&s;h &s;uch as the Synod had condemned) and the calling of another; who disfranchi&s;ed, di&s;armed and bani&s;hed a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons. And their &s;econd Synod declared it to be the duty of the magi&s;trate to put forth his <HI>coer&s;ive power again&s;t &s;chi&s;matics;</HI> the effects whereof were the fin|ing, impri&s;oning, &s;courging, bani&s;hing and hang|ing of tho&s;e they &s;o called: And the re&s;ult of the fourth Synod cau&s;ed the nailing up of the Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e in Bo&s;ton (vol. 1. p. 83&mdash;86, 190, 218, 236, 329, 379, 387, 483:) And are all the&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="018336_0093_0FA5D3DEB626CB00">weapons <HI>purely &s;piritual!</HI> His meaning no doubt was, that their Synods only informed rulers of what was their duty, which they were to do out of regard to God, and not to them. But the mo&s;t horrid per|&s;ecutions that ever were practi&s;ed were done under &s;uch pretences. And this author was in earne&s;t to have their order of mini&s;ters &s;upported by taxes, impo&s;ed and collected "In the King's name." To ju&s;tify which he &s;ays, "If the mo&s;t of the inhabi|tants in a plantation are Epi&s;copalians, they will have a mini&s;ter of their own per&s;ua&s;ion; and the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> if there be any in the place, mu&s;t pay their proportion of the tax, for the &s;upport of this <HI>legal mini&s;ter</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 21.</NOTE>." He knew that &s;uch an in&s;tance had not then taken place in New-England; and we know that every thing of that nature has been ear|ne&s;tly oppo&s;ed therein ever &s;ince. And he then com|mended &s;ome of his party, for involving a &s;alary for their mini&s;ters in a general rate for all town charges, "Where Quakeri&s;m was trouble&s;ome<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 22.</NOTE>;" which he might have &s;aid was likewi&s;e done to the Bapti&s;ts in Rehoboth, if he had been willing the whole truth &s;hould be known.

<P>I HAVE newly received, under covert of Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender, your long looked-for letter, dated the 25th of December, and give you thanks for the account you give me of the affairs of your church, your circum&s;tances, and your neighbours. I am glad the books &s;ent you are of u&s;e unto you; by the &s;ame hand you will have another forwarded, which I value, and &s;uppo&s;e you will. I rejoice in
<PB N="79" REF="018336_0094_0FA5D3E037A03818">the &s;ucce&s;s of your mini&s;try, and increa&s;e of your church, which will naturally increa&s;e your cares with your joy. I mourn becau&s;e of the ignorance of your &s;leeping Sabbatarians: Let us be thankful for our light, pity them and pray for them, and en|deavour in love to lead them into the light al&s;o. God, that hath &s;hined into our hearts by his go&s;pel, can lead them from the Sinai covenant and the law of ceremonies, into the light of the new covenant and the grace thereof. I pity to &s;ee profe&s;&s;ors drawing back to the law, and de&s;ire to remember that our &s;tanding is by grace; and therefore not to be high-minded over them, but fear, remembering our Lord's words, <HI>watch and pray, le&s;t ye enter into temp|tation.</HI> Every word of God is precious; the &s;aints love it; and they that honor him he will honor; and in keeping of it there is pre&s;ent peace, and a promi&s;e of future reward: We now live by faith and not by &s;ight; he that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved. Go on, Sir, &s;owing the &s;eed, looking up to him who&s;e work alone it is to give the increa&s;e, whoever be the planter or waterer; and as you do abound in your labours, and do find him multiply|ing &s;eed unto you, may you yet abound more and more to the end, which is my &s;incere wi&s;h. Let no man rob us of our comfortable hope, that when we cea&s;e to be here we &s;hall be pre&s;ent with the Lord, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the &s;aints believe is fulne&s;s of joy in a &s;eparate &s;tate, and expectation of great|er in the re&s;urrection, when it &s;hall be fully mani|fe&s;ted how he loved them. Let none jeer us out of our duty now to li&s;p forth his prai&s;es with our tongues, &s;ince we expect hereafter to &s;ing in a better manner the &s;ong of the Lamb, with a much more noble chorus. In reference to your poll-tax and other taxes, which are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upport of the
<PB N="80" REF="018336_0095_0FA5D3E05F74D370">government and &s;ociety, are not to be e&s;teemed a burthen; it is giving tribute or tithes to whom tri|bute is due, unle&s;s the taxes do oppre&s;s you unequally, becau&s;e you are Bapti&s;ts and Separati&s;ts; if &s;o, then let me know (who profe&s;s my&s;elf a Bapti&s;t) and I will endeavour to have a word &s;poken for you to the Governor, that you may be ea&s;ed. You know that our profe&s;&s;ion is not mody in your country nor ours; few if any of the great men &s;ubmitting to plain in|&s;titution; and as we profe&s;s our&s;elves di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, it is our duty to take up our cro&s;s with pa|tience, and pay parochial duties where we live, and voluntarily maintain our own charge, and be thankful for our liberty as men and Chri&s;tians to our good God, who in his providence has in&s;pired many magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters in your Province with a truer &s;pirit of catholic charity than formerly. You have heard, or may be informed by Mr. Callender, of my foundation in Harvard college, and the provi&s;ion I have made for Bapti&s;t youth to be educated for the mini&s;try, and equally regarded with Pedobap|ti&s;ts. If you know any as may be duly qualified, inform me, and I &s;hall be glad to recommend them for the fir&s;t vacancy. And to clo&s;e; while we pro|fe&s;s to wor&s;hip God nearer to the rule of primitive in&s;titution and practice of our great prophet and teacher, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, let our light &s;o &s;hine before men in all holy conver&s;a|tion, that &s;uch who&s;e inclinations may be ready to &s;peak evil of our way may be a&s;hamed. May &s;eri|ous religion and godline&s;s in the power of it flou|ri&s;h among us; every thing that goes in to make up the true Chri&s;tian. Where the image of Chri&s;t is formed in any, I call them the excellent of the earth; with &s;uch I delight to a&s;&s;ociate and wor&s;hip, what|ever particular denomination they may go by among
<PB N="81" REF="018336_0096_0FA5D3E118738D50">men; and this I would do till we all come into the unity of the faith, &amp;c. Acts xx. 32.</P>

<P>THIS I copied from the original letter; and would ju&s;t ob&s;erve upon it, that the generality of pari&s;h rates here were only for the &s;upport of one way of wor&s;hip, and not for the government, as he &s;uppo&s;ed.

<SALUTE>Dear Brother Callender,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of yours by Capt. Law|rence, and am glad to hear of your welfare. May the Lord pre&s;erve your health and u&s;efulne&s;s. I rejoice at the increa&s;e of your members, and the good pro&s;pect you have of more being added to your church, even of &s;uch who &s;hall be &s;aved. It is &s;weet encouragement to a poor labourer in Chri&s;t's vineyard, to find the Lord works with him; and &s;ome vi&s;ible in&s;tances of &s;overeign grace and love among his people make his drooping &s;pirit revive and &s;ing. May you have more of the&s;e, e&s;pecially among the ri&s;ing generation; for it is a particular plea&s;ure to &s;ee young ones look Zionward, and tru|ly remember their Creator in the days of their youth; though in this ca&s;e we have always rea&s;on to rejoice with trembling, becau&s;e &s;o many who &s;eemed to run well for a time, have been turned a&s;ide by youthful lu&s;ts (which war again&s;t the &s;oul) to the wounding the hearts of their mini&s;ters, and the di&s;honor of Chri&s;t. I am &s;orry you have &s;o much cau&s;e to com|plain, with us, of the great decay of the power and purity of religion. I am afraid this inqui&s;itive age of profe&s;&s;ors &s;pend too much time, and almo&s;t all their zeal, about matters of &s;peculation, and neglect
<PB N="82" REF="018336_0097_0FA5D3E1DB054C20">the clo&s;et and inward experimental religion too much. I ob&s;erve by &s;ome letters and papers, by Capt. Lawrence, that there is a number of young men formed into a &s;ociety at Bo&s;ton, who have taken upon them the name of the Barean Society. It is a noble de&s;ign to be wholly governed by &s;crip|ture, and wi&s;h every profe&s;&s;or had &s;uch a re&s;olution. They &s;eem to be in earne&s;t about what they pro|po&s;e, and if any of their zeal, for any particular point in di&s;pute among Chri&s;tians, &s;hould flame too high, I am glad they are under your conduct, by which I hope they will be directed for their mutual edification, and the honor of truth. They will have &s;ome books contained in the catalogue &s;ent &s;oon, when I hope to write more particularly on this head. I met Capt. Lawrence at our honored friend Mr. Thomas Hollis's, where we had &s;ome particular di&s;|cour&s;e about your place and people, and how his bounty to your church was laid out. From the whole I apprehend Mr. Hollis was not di&s;plea&s;ed, but approved of what you had done, and hath been &s;o good as to order the remaining part of the money for your own u&s;e; be&s;ides which he hath been plea&s;|ed to &s;end you a pre&s;ent of books. I have often, my dear friend, adored the divine goodne&s;s, in di&s;|po&s;ing this gentleman's mind to &s;o much &s;ervice for the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in general, in New-England as well as Old; but e&s;pecially for the providence by which &s;uch a gentleman came to the knowledge of our &s;mall intere&s;t in tho&s;e Colonies, who had &s;uch a love to de&s;pi&s;ed truth, as to own and encourage it in the face of &s;o many and powerful oppo&s;ers. It is this good providence, I apprehend, hath occa|&s;ioned &s;ome per&s;ons to look favourably towards the baptized intere&s;t in Bo&s;ton, and gives an encourag|ing view of greater advantage in years to come.
<PB N="83" REF="018336_0098_0FA5D3E2AF38A750">His favours to you and yours hath doubtle&s;s been ungrateful to &s;ome of your neighbours, and perhaps &s;ome have been unkind and weak enough to de&s;ign you a prejudice by &s;ome accounts given; but be in no pain for that, for Mr. Hollis is no &s;tranger to the weakne&s;&s;es which good men are liable to; nor will he be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded into hard thoughts of any, notwith&s;tanding their many weakne&s;&s;es, who in their general conduct have acquitted them&s;elves like Chri&s;tians and hone&s;t men; nor do any who attempt to draw his di&s;plea&s;ure upon another per&s;on without good rea&s;on, do him&s;elf the lea&s;t &s;ervice thereby with Mr. Hollis. That the good will of him that dwelt in the bu&s;h may be with you and yours, is the hearty de&s;ire of your &s;incere friend and unwor|thy brother,</P>

IN addition to his other donations, Mr. Hollis founded a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of the mathematics and experimental philo&s;ophy in Harvard college, in 1726, with a &s;alary of Eighty Pounds a year to the profe&s;&s;or; and he &s;ent over an apparatus for the purpo&s;e, which co&s;t about One Hundred and Fifty Pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides large additions to the college library.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal, vol. 2, p. 220, 221.</NOTE>.

He went accordingly, and on July 23, 1727, baptized John Leonard, Eben|ezer Leonard, William Scott, Abel Leonard, and Thomas Lamb, of Springfield, and Victory Sykes and Marcy Lawton, of Suffield.

Mr. De|votion was mini&s;ter in Suffield, and Bull in We&s;t|field; the other three were of Springfield.

<P N="8">VIII. I FIND no an&s;wer to this.&mdash;Upon the re|ceipt of their &s;econd charter, Dr. Cotton Mather &s;aid, "Religion is forever &s;ecured; a righteous and ge|nerous liberty of con&s;cience e&s;tabli&s;hed. And the General A&s;&s;embly may, by their acts, give a <HI>di&s;|tingui&s;hing</HI> encouragement unto that religion which is the <HI>general profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of his father's life, p. 141. He him&s;elf died Fe|bruary 13, 1728, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. 65.</NOTE>." And for thirty-&s;ix years they made no act to exempt either Bapti&s;ts or Quakers from taxes to his party of mini&s;ters. The great earthquake was in the even|ing of October 29, 1727; and the A&s;&s;embly that met the 22d of the next month pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t act of exemption therefrom, that they ever did for any denomination. It was to impower every &s;ettled Epi&s;copal mini&s;ter to draw all the money which was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon any of his &s;ociety, who lived with|in five miles of his meeting, if they u&s;ually attend|ed wor&s;hip there; who were al&s;o to be exempted from taxes for building or repairing of meeting-hou&s;es for the e&s;tabli&s;hed way. But it required each pari&s;h to make up to their mini&s;ters, within two months, all the money that might by their means be taken from them. The five mile limitation was dropt afterwards; and by an act in 1742, the mini|&s;ter and church-wardens were required to give cer|tificates to each pari&s;h trea&s;urer, where any of their &s;ociety lived, in order for their drawing &s;aid money.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more amazing among men, than the influence which the love of power and gain has to blind their minds. The admi&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;es both of Orange and Hanover to the Briti&s;h throne,
<PB N="86" REF="018336_0101_0FA5D222D9F343C8">was upon the principle that government is founded in compact. And the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article of the national compact was, that none &s;hould be taxed but by their own repre&s;entatives. Yet becau&s;e the re|pre&s;entatives in this government refu&s;ed to put it out of their power to give or withhold the &s;alary demanded by the Crown, for Governors that they could have no choice in appointing or remov|ing, an attempt was made in England to bring the ca&s;e before the Parliament, and to take away our &s;econd charter. But Mr. Jeremiah Dummer, bro|ther to the Lieutenant-Governor, publi&s;hed in London &s;uch a defence of our charter-rights in 1721, as, with other things, prevented it. Though in 1725 an explanatory charter was added, which deprived the repre&s;entatives of power to put their own Speaker into office, without the con&s;ent of the Governor. The&s;e things were ju&s;tly complained of, by tho&s;e who daily practi&s;ed a like iniquity them&s;elves. For it is not more certain that Ame|rica is not repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Parliament, than it is that a quantity of <HI>money</HI> does not give any men a right to judge for their neighbours about &s;oul-guides, and to enforce their judgments with the &s;word. Yet this was daily practi&s;ed to &s;up|port teachers, that many who were taxed to them had no more voice in choo&s;ing, than &s;aid repre&s;en|tatives had in their Governors. But as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> conten|tions &s;till continued about the Governor's &s;alary, and other dangers hung over them, when their A&s;&s;embly met at Bo&s;ton in May, 1728, they made a law,</P>

Hereupon they &s;ent a petition to Governor Burnet in Council; wherein they claimed charter rights, and mentioned the late declaration from England, that there was no national or provincial church e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and the relea&s;e of pri&s;oners upon that footing; and that if relief was not granted to them, they &s;oon expected the impri&s;onment of &s;everal Bapti&s;ts and Quakers, of Taunton and Norton, on the &s;ame &s;core. The Governor and Council, on March 8, gave their opinion, that &s;aid law did take place the preceding year; and ordered Seth Williams, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chief Judge of that county, to convene a number of
<PB N="89" REF="018336_0104_0FA5D22515F1B8B8">Ju&s;tices at Bri&s;tol, and to do all they lawfully could for the relea&s;e of tho&s;e pri&s;oners. He convened &s;ome of them, but gave no relief to tho&s;e men. Mr. Comer came and preached to them March 11. And as no other way appeared of deliverance from a nau&s;eous place which had injured their health, but paying &s;aid taxes and co&s;ts, this was &s;oon after done by their friends. However, le&s;t further com|plaints &s;hould be carried to England, the A&s;&s;em|bly at Bo&s;ton, November 19, 1729, added an act to exempt their e&s;tates and faculties al&s;o; but ".Under the &s;ame conditions and limitations that their polls were before." And it was not to exempt from any tax that was made, and then in collectors hands, nor to continue in force any longer than their May &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1733.</P>
<P N="10">X.

Stephen Gorton was ordained, at New-London, pa&s;tor of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Connecticut, November 28, 1726, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their elders, Wightman of Groton, and Comer of New|port. And as Wightman was called to preach in Lyme, Mr. John Bulkly, a learned mini&s;ter of Colche&s;ter, came and held a public di&s;pute with him at Lyme, June 7, 1727, upon bapti&s;m and mini&s;ters &s;upport. The que&s;tion concerning the latter point Wightman &s;tated thus: "Whether mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel ought to be maintained in the lea&s;t, by goods taken away by force from men of contrary per&s;ua&s;ions?" And he gave the&s;e rea|&s;ons again&s;t that practice: "1. Becau&s;e there is no precept nor precedent for &s;o doing in the new
<PB N="90" REF="018336_0105_0FA5D2260BFF22F0">te&s;tament. 2. Becau&s;e &s;o to do is what we would not be done unto our&s;elves. 3. Becau&s;e the Lord requires only volunteers, and not forced men in his &s;ervice." But Bulkly refu&s;ed to di&s;pute upon this footing, and &s;hifted the que&s;tion, to whether their way was lawful or not? And, after going far about, he &s;aid, "Lawful authority have a right to determine the undetermined modes of moral duties." To which Wightman &s;aid,
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. But they mu&s;t always determine the mode in the order of morality, and &s;o they may do to others, as they would they &s;hould do to them in like ca&s;e.

And as Bulkly raked together many &s;candalous things that had been publi&s;hed again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, and then &s;aid, "They are but of ye&s;terday, and &s;o con&s;equently the truth cannot be with them, as being not known in the world till about two hundred years pa&s;t;" Wightman repli|ed and &s;aid, "I never read of a Pre&s;byterian longer than the &s;aid term; how then can the way of truth be with them?

<P>HEREUPON the A&s;&s;embly, who met at New-Haven, October 9, 1729, pa&s;&s;ed an act to allow the Bapti&s;ts the &s;ame privileges as were granted to the Quakers the May before; both of them being perpetual laws, and not &s;uch temporary acts as the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have perplexed them&s;elves and others with. Pre&s;ident Stiles informs me, that the Bapti&s;ts in Saybrook were the fir&s;t who took the benefit of this act. And a conci&s;e account of the affairs of the college he pre&s;ides over &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter. Connecticut Legi&s;lature fir&s;t granted a charter for it in 1701. It was then intended to be
<PB N="92" REF="018336_0107_0FA5D22B37F29DD8">at Saybrook; but after hot contentions, wherein a large and valuable part of their library was lo&s;t, it was &s;ettled at New-Haven in 1718. Elihu Yale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of the Ea&s;t-India Company in Lon|don, made large donations to it, upon which it was called Yale College. In 1719, Mr. Timothy Cutler, mini&s;ter at Stratford, was cho&s;en Rector of it. But in September, 1722, he re&s;igned that office, and went to England for Epi&s;copal ordi|nation, from whence he al&s;o received the title of D. D. and was a mi&s;&s;ionary many years in Bo&s;ton. After his departure, Mr. Samuel Andrew, mini&s;ter at Milford, pre&s;ided at their commencements, until Mr. Eli&s;ha Williams, of Wethersfield, was cho&s;en their Rector in 1725; which office he &s;u&s;tained with honor to him&s;elf, and advantage to others, till he re&s;igned it on October 31, 1739, and removed back to Wethersfield; which town he often repre|&s;ented in their A&s;&s;embly, and was &s;erviceable in other offices; one of which was to go over as a &s;pe|cial Agent for his Colony to England. Mr. Tho|mas Clap, of Windham, &s;ucceeded him in the col|lege; the government of which, by their fir&s;t char|ter, was in the Tru&s;tees, who cho&s;e the Rector and Tutors. But by a more ample charter from their Legi&s;lature, dated May 9, 1745, their order was changed to that of, <HI>The Pre&s;ident and Fellows of Yale College, in New-Haven;</HI> who&s;e number is twelve.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>1. A general View of the Affairs of Rhode-I&s;land Colony. 1. Of par|ticular Errors therein. 3. Their civil State conci&s;ely de&s;cribed. 4. Their Order commended by Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Mini&s;ters. 5. Re|marks thereon. 6. Account of the Rogerenes. 7. The &s;ame in|&s;tructive to others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. SINCE the di&s;orders in Rhode-I&s;land Colony have often been recurred to, as a prevailing argument for &s;upporting wor&s;hip by tax and com|pul&s;ion, the evil effects of which have had a great influence in continuing &s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;orders, an humble attempt &s;hall here be made to &s;earch this matter to the bottom. And in the fir&s;t place we are to remember, that the exi&s;tence of that Colony, as a di&s;tinct government, was long an eye-&s;ore to many of their neighbours; who tried a variety of mean and cruel methods to divide and conquer it. And Solomon &s;ays, &s;urely oppre&s;&s;ion maketh a wi&s;e man mad; and none will pretend that all the inhabitants of the Colony were wi&s;e men: Yet all the mad|ne&s;s of their wi&s;e men, and all the ignorance and folly of others, have been indu&s;triou&s;ly held up to the world, as a convincing proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of an e&s;tabli&s;hed religion by human laws. And as the terms learned and orthodox have been connected in
<PB N="94" REF="018336_0109_0FA5D22E40D4D460">this argument, colleges and per&s;ecution have grown up together in the ideas of multitudes; and in not a few Calvini&s;m, family wor&s;hip, and a religious regard to the Chri&s;tian &s;abbath, have gone in|to the &s;ame connexion. Notwith&s;tanding it is mo&s;t certain, that Mr. Williams, the founder of &s;aid Colony, and Mr. Clarke, who procured their &s;econd charter, were men of &s;uperior learning, and held &s;trictly to the doctrines of &s;overeign grace, and to the duties of private and public wor&s;hip; as many other fathers of the Colony al&s;o did. But their children, as well as others, have been more ready to retain their errors than their virtues; &s;ome of which I will name.</P>
<P N="2">II. DAILY prayer to God for what we need, and prai&s;es for what we receive, are duties taught by rea&s;on as well as revelation; and every per&s;on is <HI>inexcu&s;able</HI> that neglects the <HI>immediate</HI> practice of tho&s;e duties, P&s;alm cvii. 8, 15, 28, 43, Acts xvii. 27, Rom. i. 20, 21. But the ordinances of &s;pecial communion in the Chri&s;tian church, are only known by pure revelation, which requires previous per&s;onal qualifications before any may partake therein. But Mr. Williams, about the time of his bani&s;hment from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, blended the&s;e two kinds of duties &s;o much toge|ther, as to oppo&s;e the inculcating of prayer upon the unregenerate, as well as the immediate prac|tice of church communion: As if a criminal might not petition for help and mercy, nor give thanks for what he received, any more than to act in fel|low&s;hip with his Prince before he was pardoned and reconciled. And ca&s;ting off fear, and re&s;train|ing prayer before God, is &s;o exceeding natural to men, that great numbers have held fa&s;t this error. Above three years after Mr. Williams was
<PB N="95" REF="018336_0110_0FA5D22EE5FF3BE0">bani&s;hed, he al&s;o &s;tumbled upon another error, which many who reproach him are &s;till tenacious of; namely, the opinion that mini&s;terial authority mu&s;t be derived by an external &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from in|&s;pired men. The confounding of the Jewi&s;h prie&s;thood with the go&s;pel mini&s;try, is the &s;ource of this error. Upon their return from Babylon, tho&s;e prie&s;ts who could not produce a <HI>regi&s;ter</HI> of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from Aaron, were not &s;uffered to officiate as &s;uch, until a new mi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be given from above, Ezra ii. 62, 63. And not finding a like regi&s;ter from the apo&s;tles, cau&s;ed Mr. Williams to refrain from church communion in his latter days, though not from public wor&s;hip. And how ready have many been from hence to excu&s;e them&s;elves in a carele&s;s neglect of all re|ligion? To which Gorton's teaching and influ|ence added great force. He had a &s;ingular knack at turning the &s;criptures into mi&s;t and allegory, under a pretence of great &s;pirituality; and al&s;o at running down his opponents with &s;atyr and ridi|cule; arts that have been very bewitching in lat|ter ages. The coming and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t he held to be my&s;tical, and not literal; and he treated the doctrine of vi&s;ible in&s;tituted churches with the utmo&s;t contempt. Says he, "Such Phari&s;aical interpreters, who erect churches as true churches of God, that admit of decay, and falling from God, in whole or any members thereof, are they who have deceived and undone the world, from the foundation thereof unto this day, and are the proper <HI>witches</HI> of the world which the &s;cripture intends." And he con&s;trued the mint, ani&s;e and cummin of the Phari&s;ees, as applicable to all who practi&s;e the external admini&s;tration of bapti&s;m,
<PB N="96" REF="018336_0111_0FA5D22FA13B89B0">breaking of bread, and church cen&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gordon's antidote again&s;t Phari&s;aical teachers, p. 42, 52.</NOTE>. He was a leader in public wor&s;hip at Warwick for &s;ixty years, by way of teaching, prayer and &s;inging; but having no &s;ucce&s;&s;or, furni&s;hed with his art, a ne|glect if not a contempt of public wor&s;hip and of other religious duties has greatly prevailed in tho&s;e parts, enforced with the remembrance of former cruelties &s;hown to their fathers under religious pre|tences. And as Calvini&s;m was the general plan of orthodoxy among their oppre&s;&s;ors, the oppo&s;ite &s;en|timents more ea&s;ily prevailed in mo&s;t of the Bapti&s;t churches, though it was an apo&s;ta&s;y from the doc|trines they were founded upon. And running into extremes, on other accounts, increa&s;ed their unhap|pine&s;s. Being hardly accu&s;ed with the want of valid admini&s;trators, moved &s;even Bapti&s;t churches, who met in London in 1643, to declare it as their faith, that by Chri&s;t's commi&s;&s;ion every di&s;ciple, who had a gift to preach the go&s;pel, had a right to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, even before he was ordained in any church<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cro&s;by, vol. 1, appendix, p. 21.</NOTE>. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that Philip was an ordained officer in the church before he baptized the young believ|ers at Samaria; while none but apo&s;tles laid on hands after bapti&s;m, both there and at Ephe&s;us; and which was attended with extraordinary effects in each place, Acts viii. 14, 17, xix. 6. Yet Mr. Samuel Hubbard informs us, that in 1652 the practice was adopted, fir&s;t at Providence, and then at Newport, of gifted di&s;ciples admini&s;tring both bapti&s;m and laying on of hands, who were not or|dained officers in any church; which practice was continued by &s;ome for many years after. In 1725 the &s;econd church in Swanzey voted to make lay|ing on of hands a term of their communion: Per|haps
<PB N="97" REF="018336_0112_0FA5D2306FE1DFA0">others had done &s;o before. Many conten|tions and divi&s;ions were cau&s;ed by the&s;e things, which greatly ob&s;tructed go&s;pel order in their church|es. But as the Chri&s;tian church is the pillar and ground of the truth, and bapti&s;m is the initiating or|dinance thereof, it &s;urely mu&s;t belong to her, e&s;pe|cially at ordinary times, to &s;et men apart to admi|ni&s;ter it.</P>
<P>INTERNAL right, and an external warrant to exer|ci&s;e it, are di&s;tinct things. Every renewed &s;oul has an internal right to the &s;pecial privileges of the church of Chri&s;t; and tho&s;e to whom he has given &s;pecial gifts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the mini&s;try, have an internal right to improve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m; but a per&s;on mu&s;t be received as an orderly member of a particular church in order to his acting as &s;uch; and tho&s;e who are qualified for officers ought to be &s;et apart as &s;uch before they baptize others. This is now generally allowed. Both &s;cripture and rea&s;on plainly &s;hew, that actions may be done in extraordinary ca&s;es, which ought not in ordinary times.</P>
<P N="3">III. As to their civil affairs, the fir&s;t charter of Providence Colony extended to the Pequot river and country, that is, into the heart of New-London county; and it was given eighteen years before Connecticut charter. And the &s;econd charter to Rhode-I&s;land Colony was given by the &s;ame autho|rity which gave that of Connecticut; and this au|thority fixed the line betwixt them in a mo&s;t explicit manner: Yet Connecticut made a practice of vio|lently crowding over that line for above &s;ixty years after they received their charter. In 1720 Gover|nor Jencks was &s;ent over Agent to England for help again&s;t them. At length, on September 27, 1728, Roger Wolcott, James Wad&s;worth, and Daniel Palmer, Commi&s;&s;ioners for Connecticut, and Wil|liam
<PB N="98" REF="018336_0113_0FA5D231208001E0">Wanton, Benjamin Ellery, and William Jencks, for Rhode-I&s;land, &s;igned a &s;ettlement of that line. The &s;outh part is exactly according to Rhode-I&s;land charter; the north part bears a little ea&s;t thereof. Plymouth Colony was only a voluntary combination among them&s;elves, as to government; though they were allowed to continue &s;o till the revolution. And Rhode I&s;land charter was given twenty-eight years before Plymouth was incorpo|rated with the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; yet the line on that &s;ide was never e&s;tabli&s;hed, until it was done by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion in 1741, according to the olde&s;t charter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dougla&s;s, vol. 1, p. 400, vol. 2, p. 51</NOTE>; which gave Rhode-I&s;land the towns of Little-Compton, Tiverton, Bri&s;tol, Warren, Bar|rington, and Cumberland, that they had not enjoy|ed before (vol. 1, p. 347, 350.) The hi&s;tory of their civil government may properly be divided in|to four periods. Before the revolution of 1688, parties both on &s;ecular and religious accounts cau&s;ed much unhappine&s;s. From thence to 1732 their government was in wi&s;e and &s;teady hands; &s;o that they had but two Governors in thirty-four years. Afterwards a depreciating paper currency, with bri|bery in elections, produced many and great evils; a &s;ight of which moved the two competitors for the office of Governor amicably to give up their pre|ten&s;ions, and to prevail with a very peaceable gen|tleman to accept the chair in 1769. Since then bribery and party influence have been better guard+ed again&s;t. And can any or all of the&s;e things af|ford the lea&s;t rea&s;on again&s;t equal liberty, or for the u&s;e of compul&s;ion in the &s;upport of wor&s;hip? Yea, have not our opponents given evidence to the con|trary in that Colony? The fir&s;t Congregational church therein was formed at Newport, and Mr.
<PB N="99" REF="018336_0114_0FA5D231DFE6BF80">Nathanael Clap, from Dorche&s;ter, was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 3, 1720. He was a man of emi|nent piety, who began to preach there in 1695, and was a great ble&s;&s;ing among them till his death, on October 30, 1745, aet. 78; for whom Mr. John Callender preached and printed a funeral &s;ermon. Mr. Clap was a hearty friend to the primitive or|der of their churches: But Mr. John Adams, a young teacher of the modern &s;tamp, gained the af|fections of a large part of his church; and becau&s;e Mr. Clap could not con&s;ent to his &s;ettling as col|league with him, nor break bread to a number of the members, a party council divided the church, and the young mini&s;ter was ordained over a majority, April 11, 1728; &s;o that Mr. Clap was &s;hut out of his meeting-hou&s;e, and his people built another for him.

But if you mean, that we &s;hould not &s;peak of former actions, done hurtfully to any man's per&s;on, we &s;ay, God never called for that, nor &s;uffered it to be hid, as witne&s;s Cain, Joab and Judas, are kept on record to deter other men from doing the like." A reply hereto was printed at Bo&s;ton, dated September 7, 1722, which did not pretend to deny the facts here mentioned; but made a great flouri&s;h upon a <HI>word,</HI> which was not in their fir&s;t printed letter, but was the error of the pre&s;s in a &s;econd edition; and then took occa|&s;ion from what they &s;aid about recording hurtful actions to publi&s;h a copy of a &s;entence of Court again&s;t Sprague in Bo&s;ton, April 28, 1674, "For reproaching and &s;candalizing the magi&s;trates, and for la&s;civious carriage."

<P>SENSIBLE how the populace had been deceived by &s;uch arts, Sprague wrote a rejoinder, dated January 24, 1723, in which he makes &s;ome apo|logy for taking notice of &s;uch an anonymous revi|ling piece, which profanely &s;ets the Court records of Bo&s;ton upon a level with God's infallible record concerning Cain and Judas; and informs us that one of the two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, in that ca&s;e at Bo&s;ton, was afterwards brought to repentance, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church he belonged to in
<PB N="104" REF="018336_0119_0FA5D2397501D300">Providence; when &s;he a&s;ked and received his for|givene&s;s, for wronging him in her te&s;timony in that ca&s;e. He al&s;o ob&s;erves, that the affair was in his early days, before he made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, when he really was a vile &s;inner. And for the &s;atis|faction of &s;erious people he &s;ays,
<Q><L>"My youthful walk I'll not commend,</L>

<P>"BUT la&s;tly, why do you &s;trive to per&s;uade the ri&s;ing generation, that you never per&s;ecuted nor hurt the Bapti&s;ts? Did you not barbarou&s;ly &s;courge Mr. Obadiah Holmes, and impri&s;on John Hazel, of Rehoboth, who died and came not home? And did you not barbarou&s;ly &s;courge Mr. Baker, in Cambridge, the chief mate of a London &s;hip? Where al&s;o you impri&s;oned Mr. Thomas Gould, John Ru&s;&s;el, Benjamin Sweet&s;er, and many others, and fined them Fifty Pounds a man. And did you not take away a part of the &s;aid Sweet&s;er's land, to pay his fine, and conveyed it to Solomon Phips, the Deputy-Governor Danforth's &s;on-in-law, who after,
<PB N="105" REF="018336_0120_0FA5D23A2D1F9ED8">by the hand of God ran di&s;tracted, dying &s;udden|ly, &s;aying he was bewitched?

Mr. Sprague preached for many years to a &s;mall &s;ociety of Bap|ti&s;ts in that which is now the ea&s;t part of Smith|field; and died in January, 1741, aet. 93. Mr. Comer knew him, and &s;peaks of him as a very ju|dicious and pious man.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AS a further proof on the evil effects of coercive mea&s;ures about religious wor&s;hip, I &s;hall here add &s;ome account of John Rogers, of New-London, and his followers, who are briefly de&s;cribed in vol. 1, p. 473&mdash;480. He intermixed a number of precious truths, with may things of a contrary nature. Governor Leete well ob&s;erved, in a letter there publi&s;hed, that if Rogers and his party had been Governors in Connecticut, it might be doubted whether they would have allowed peo|ple &s;o much liberty in keeping the fir&s;t day of the week as a &s;abbath, as the goverment there al|lowed to him and his followers in the oppo&s;ite way. For Rogers imagining that the law which required the keeping of that day e&s;tabli&s;hed idolatry, was as zealous to pull it down, as the Jews were again&s;t idols in old times. And the &s;ufferings which he met with, for his zeal about this and other religious matters, &s;eemed to be his life; until, to &s;hew how &s;trong his faith was, he went to Bo&s;ton, and among the infection of the &s;mall-pox there; but catched it, came home and died with it, and cau&s;ed the death of &s;ome others thereby. This many might think
<PB N="106" REF="018336_0121_0FA5D23ADEEEF9D0">was quite enough to open the eyes of his followers; but it was far from doing it. Perhaps they might think he was taken away in judgment to them, for their coldne&s;s and negligence. Certain it is that Jo&s;eph Bolles now publi&s;hed a &s;econd edition of Rogers's book, intituled, "A midnight cry from the temple of God to the ten virgins &s;lumbering and &s;leeping; awake, awake, ari&s;e, and gird your loins, and trim your lamps, for behold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ridegroom cometh, go ye therefore out to meet him!" Bolles wrote a preface to it, in which he &s;ays of the author, "For his religion he lo&s;t his wife and children, and &s;uf|fered continual per&s;ecution, being near one third of his lifetime, after his conver&s;ion, in pri&s;ons. And in the 73d year of his age, he died in his own hou&s;e, at New-London, 1721." Hereupon his &s;on, and others of that &s;ect, &s;et out afre&s;h in zealous attempts to pull down the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l-&s;abbath; and as a number of them came into Norwich, in their way to Le|banon, on a fir&s;t day, having things with them to di&s;cover that they were upon worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, and meant to appear again&s;t having that day kept as a &s;abbath, they were &s;eized by authority; and on July 26, 1725, they were brought before Jo&s;eph Backus, Ju&s;tice of the Peace, who fined them ac|cording to law; and refu&s;ing to pay it, they were whipped.</P>
<P N="7">VII. GOVERNOR Jencks being informed of their &s;ufferings, and that it was becau&s;e they were going to Lebanon to wor&s;hip, and to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, wrote a paper, giving &s;ome account there|of, as a warning to people again&s;t the Pre&s;byterian &s;ect, and &s;et it up in a public place in Providence. The Ju&s;tice having obtained a copy of that paper, publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to it; a manu&s;cript reply to which, in the Governor's own hand writing, is
<PB N="107" REF="018336_0122_0FA5D23BB0E82FF8">before me. He does not pretend to reply to it all; for &s;ays he, "Such unchri&s;tian-like behaviour, in giving them di&s;turbance when at their public wor|&s;hip, if true, may ju&s;tly be condemned by all &s;ober people, and is that which never entered into my thoughts to ju&s;tify in John Rogers, or any other man." But &s;ays the Governor, "It is very well known, to all the elderly inhabitants of Providence, that the Pre&s;byterian governments in New-England in general, and Connecticut in particular, have for a long time been u&s;ing their utmo&s;t &s;kill and endea|vours to bring the greate&s;t part if not all this little Colony under their rule and government. But finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed in the &s;everal mea|&s;ures they have hitherto taken, they are now (as is &s;uppo&s;ed by many others as well as my&s;elf) about to try one artifice more in order to obtain their de|&s;ire; and that is by &s;ending in their mini&s;ters among us, under a pretence of doing good to &s;ouls; where|as the de&s;ign chiefly is, to gain &s;uch a party as may be &s;ufficient to over-vote us in our elections, and &s;o to gain the rule over us."</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE has &s;ince given much greater light about the&s;e things than was then enjoyed in the country. In 1758 the Rogerenes publi&s;hed an ab&s;tract of the hi&s;tory of ancient per&s;ecutions in New-England, with high encomiums upon tho&s;e Quakers who returned and were hanged at Bo&s;ton, after they had been bani&s;hed on pain of death; and a reproof to their own &s;ociety and others for their de|clen&s;ion from that temper and &s;pirit. Many were hereby &s;tirred up to travel from town to town, and to interrupt others in their wor&s;hip, e&s;pecially in the year 1763. But when they did &s;o, at Norwich and other places, the authority removed them away un|til their wor&s;hip was ended, and then relea&s;ed them,
<PB N="108" REF="018336_0123_0FA5D23C5D614938">without fine or correction; which had a much better effect than their former puni&s;hments. Indeed in New-London, where mo&s;t of them lived, Mr. Mather Byles was &s;o unea&s;y at their &s;urrounding his gate, and calling him a hireling, that in 1768 he made a bitter complaint that their laws were not put in full execution again&s;t &s;aid people; and for this and other rea&s;ons he re&s;igned his pa&s;toral charge there, and went off to Epi&s;copacy. About which time, a number of the Rogerenes were &s;eized in a clande&s;|tine way, and were &s;courged in a mo&s;t barbarous manner; for which may all the actors or abettors thereof be brought to true repentance! An in&s;tance or two of late &s;uicide among the members of the Rogerene church, gave a great &s;hock to the re&s;t; and a number of their children are now become agreeable members of other communities. And if all per&s;ons and &s;ocieties were impartially protected by authority, and none but &s;piritual weapons were made u&s;e of, and they with due faithfulne&s;s, to pro|pagate and &s;upport the Chri&s;tian religion, who can tell how happy the effects would &s;oon be?</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. SOME revival of religion among the Bap|ti&s;ts, as well as oppo&s;ition thereto, is now to be de&s;cribed. Mr. John Clark was a chief leader in forming the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Newport, in 1644; and he continued their pa&s;tor until his de|cea&s;e, April 20, 1676. Mr. Obadiah Holmes &s;uc|ceeded him in that office, and died October 15, 1682. Near three years after Mr. Richard Dingley, from Britain by the way of Bo&s;ton, became their pa&s;tor. An addre&s;s of his to the church is before me, where|in he de&s;cribes the duty of a pa&s;tor to his people, and of a people to their pa&s;tor, in a clear &s;criptural light. About 1694 he left that church and went to Bo&s;ton, and from thence to South-Carolina. Af|ter his departure they had only occa&s;ional &s;upplies till 1710, when they elected Mr. William Packom for their pa&s;tor, in who&s;e ordination Elder Luther
<PB N="110" REF="018336_0125_0FA5D23E169F8100">of Swanzey a&s;&s;i&s;ted. In 1718, Mr. Daniel White, from Mr. Wallin's church in London, was cho&s;en for a colleague with Elder Packom: But as he was a &s;trict Calvini&s;t, di&s;putes &s;oon aro&s;e about doc|trines, which were greatly increa&s;ed by a leader in the church, who was an a&s;&s;ign of Mr. Clark's e&s;tate, and unfaithful in his tru&s;t. Councils were called from Bo&s;ton and Swanzey upon it; and the Legi|&s;lature of the Colony were moved to put him out of that office, and to put another man into it; though upon further &s;earch they &s;aw that this was not in their power. Therefore in 1721 they made a law, which requires all men who are entru&s;ted with cha|ritable donations annually to give an account of their proceedings therein to their Town-Council, which is &s;till in force. But a &s;eparation took place in that church, and White admini&s;tered to one party for &s;everal years, till it di&s;&s;olved, and he went to Philadelphia in 1728. A difference in &s;entiments about laying on of hands, and &s;ome other things, cau&s;ed the ri&s;e of the &s;econd church in Newport, about the year 1656; and Mr. William Vaughan was their fir&s;t mini&s;ter, who died in 1677, and was &s;uc|ceeded by Thomas Baker, and he by John Harden. who died in 1700. In 1701 James Clarke was or|dained their pa&s;tor, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Elders Pardon Tillingha&s;t and John Brown of Providence. In 1704 Daniel Wightman was ordained a col|league with him; and they were &s;ucce&s;sful, and much e&s;teemed in their places to old age.</P>
<P N="2">II. MR. Comer, before mentioned, being at &s;chool at Cambridge, joined to the fir&s;t church there in February, 1723. Ephraim Crafts, his inti|mate friend, had joined to the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;|ton ju&s;t before. This Comer thought was a very
<PB N="111" REF="018336_0126_0FA5D23F92499460">wrong action, and took the fir&s;t opportunity he had to try to convince him of it: But, after a con&s;idera|ble debate, Comer was prevailed with to take and read Stennett upon bapti&s;m, which gave him quite other views of the &s;ubject than he ever had before. However he concluded to be &s;ilent about it; and as education was the cheape&s;t at New-Haven, he went and entered the college there in September, 1723. and continued a member of it until October, 1724; when infirmity of body cau&s;ed his return by water to Bo&s;ton; and a terrible &s;torm at &s;ea, with the death of a peculiar friend ju&s;t as he arrived, brought eter|nity &s;o directly before him, as to &s;poil all his plau|&s;ible excu&s;es for the neglect of bapti&s;m. He in|forms us that tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and &s;inful generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels,</HI> had &s;uch, influence upon him, that, after proper labours with tho&s;e he was previou&s;ly connected with, he was baptized and joined to the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, January 31, 1725; and concluded to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies in a private way. Four months after he was called to preach the go&s;|pel; and on May 19, 1726, he was ordained a pa&s;|tor of the fir&s;t church in Newport, colleague with Elder Packom; and a great ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon his mini&s;try in that town. Their fir&s;t church had but &s;eventeen members when he came there; to whom thirty-four were added in le&s;s than three years. And &s;ays Comer, "There was no public &s;inging until I came, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven introduced it." Neither had they any church re|cords, before he got a book, and collected into it the be&s;t accounts that he could obtain of their
<PB N="112" REF="018336_0127_0FA5D240DCA432F8">former affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was very curious and exact al&s;o in recording other events, He ob&s;erves that the year 1727 was a year of many remarkable occurrences. It was &s;o for the death of rulers. King George I. died June 11; and in Rhode-I&s;land Colony the Hon. Edward Thur&s;ton, one of their Council [father of the pre&s;ent pa&s;tor of the &s;econd church in Newport] died in April; Governor Cran|&s;ton April 26; Deputy-Governor Nichols, who was elected in May, died in July. From July 28 to Augu&s;t 7 the heat was &s;o inten&s;e as to cau&s;e the death of many. Through the three fir&s;t nights in Augu&s;t the lightnings were con&s;tant and amazing. On September 26 was a terrible hurricane; and a more terrible earth|quake October 29, which was followed with a &s;maller one in the morning of January 28, 1728. He fir&s;t mentions the northern lights, in the evening of July 16, 1728, which were much greater on October 2 following. Dean Berkley arrived at Newport Ja|nuary 23, with whom Comer had an interview July 14, 1729. Governor Burnet came to Newport, in his way to Bo&s;ton, July 12, 1728, and died at Bo&s;ton September 7, 1729. Several per|&s;ons were baptized by way of immer&s;ion by Epi&s;copalian mini|&s;ters, as Mr. Carpenter by Mr. U&s;her of Bri&s;tol, January, 1725. Nathaniel Brown, and four others at Rehoboth, by Mr. Piggot of Providence, in July, 1726. A woman at Newport, by Dr. M'Sparran, of Narragan&s;et, in November, 1728.</NOTE>. Out of a manu&s;cript written by their fir&s;t pa&s;tor, he tran&s;cribed the confe&s;&s;ion of faith mentioned in our vol. 1, p. 255. For his &s;upport he received &pound; 85 in 1726, &pound; 93 12 4 in 1727; but not a third part of this la&s;t &s;um in 1728, becau&s;e two leading members of the church, who di&s;liked his clo&s;e and &s;earching mini&s;trations, had influence enough to turn a great part of the &s;ociety again&s;t him. At length Comer gave them an occa|&s;ion, which they eagerly made u&s;e of, to croud him out of his office in that church; for, without giv|ing them any previous notice, he on November 17, 1728, preached up the laying on of hands upon every member as a Chri&s;tian duty, though not as a term of communion. Upon the clo&s;e of that year he &s;ays, "This has been a year of great exerci&s;e
<PB N="113" REF="018336_0128_0FA5D24102F16B00">to me. I have been as it were in the furnace of affliction. The difficulty in my flock has been heart-wounding, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t confound|ing: But I &s;ee God's grace is &s;ufficient for me. I am fully and clearly convinced that I &s;hould have fallen into many hurtful evils, if &s;overeign grace had not wonderfully prevented. Ble&s;s the Lord O my &s;oul.&mdash;About this time I found my people &s;o uncomfortable that we mu&s;t divide from each other, which was exceeding grievous to me."</P>
<P>JANUARY 8, 1729, Mr. Comer was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;aid church; and the next day he &s;ays, "I pa&s;&s;ed under hands by Mr. Daniel Wightman, and offered for tran&s;ient communion until &s;pring, or till I &s;aw how God in his holy providence might di&s;|po&s;e of me." A revival of religion in that &s;econd church in Newport began the fall before; and as Elder Clarke was above 80, and unable to preach, Mr. Comer was received to preach one half of the Lord's days with Elder Wightman for two years. And above forty members were added to that church before he left it; which was the greate&s;t increa&s;e they had ever received in &s;uch a length of time, at the clo&s;e whereof they had one hundred and fifty communicants, being the large&s;t church in the Colony. For Comer's &s;upport the &s;ociety gave him &pound; 129 in 1729, and &pound; 144 12 10 in 1730. As Newport was the head town of the government, Governor Jencks went and lived there, in order more conveniently to attend upon the duties of his office; where he joined in wor|&s;hip and communion with &s;aid church; wherein Mr. Comer al&s;o now introduced regular records, which they lacked before. And as Mr. John Walton, a young gentleman of a liberal education, was invit|ed to preach at Providence, where a like reforma|tion
<PB N="114" REF="018336_0129_0FA5D241B601AF00">might be hoped for, in the church whereof the Governor was a principal member, and oppo|&s;ition was rai&s;ed again&s;t it, he wrote the following letter to Mr. James Brown, their pa&s;tor.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>III. <HI>Newport,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 19, 1730.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Beloved Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM heartily &s;orry to hear of the difference in our church at Providence, about Mr. Walton's coming to &s;ettle there; as al&s;o for the unkind treat|ment he there met with from &s;ome, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering he came not there with a de&s;ign to impo&s;e him&s;elf upon the church, but at the reque&s;t of &s;eve|ral of the brethren. And why his coming there &s;hould be &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, as I under&s;tand it is, I cannot conceive. As to his &s;inging of p&s;alms, I have heard him &s;ay, he would not urge that as a duty upon the church. And if it were for that he might expect &s;ome allowance, by way of contribution, for his &s;upport, it mo&s;t certainly is an error in tho&s;e who oppo&s;e that as a thing un|lawful: For I think the &s;criptures are very clear in that point, that it is not only lawful for a mini&s;ter or elder that preaches the go&s;pel to receive (by way of contribution) a competent maintenance, but al&s;o the duty of the church, according to their ability, to afford it to him; and this I doubt not but I can fully prove by &s;cripture again&s;t all contradiction. And I believe there are &s;everal of my brethren who can remember, that Elder Tillingha&s;t (in his life|time) who was a man exemplary for his doctrine, as well as of an unblemi&s;hed character, did &s;everal times in his teaching declare, that it was the duty of a church to contribute towards the maintenance of their elders, who laboured in the word and doctrine of Chri&s;t; and although for his own part he would take nothing, yet it remained the church's duty
<PB N="115" REF="018336_0130_0FA5D242964C7348">to be performed to &s;uch as might &s;ucceed him. And as to what Mr. Walton holds with re&s;pect to laying on of hands upon believers as &s;uch, I do not under&s;tand by him that he oppo&s;es it any other ways, than if it be performed for the obtaining the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t: But he thinks it ought not to be any bar to communion with tho&s;e who have been rightly baptized. And as I have been informed, by one or more of the ancient members of our church at Providence, that &s;uch was the opinion of the Bapti&s;ts, in the fir&s;t con&s;titution of their churches, throughout this Co|lony; and that &s;uch as were under laying on of hands continued their fellow&s;hip with tho&s;e that were not, until one who was in great repute for wi&s;dom among&s;t them did in his teaching declare, that the doctrine of laying on of hands was a doc|trine of devils, upon which a &s;eparation was made: And as I was informed when in England the &s;epa|ration there was upon &s;ome &s;uch like occa&s;ion. But further, as to Mr. Walton's receiving, by way of contribution, if the church in Providence can free|ly hold fellow&s;hip with him, and do account he may be &s;erviceable to them in preaching, as well as in|&s;trumental of doing good to others; I cannot ima|gine why any one &s;hould oppo&s;e his receiving &s;ome allowance for his labour, from &s;uch as are free to give it, none being under any compul&s;ion; for I think it highly rational, if he leaves his own home, where he can, by over&s;eeing the management of his farm, live honorably, and removes to Providence purely to &s;erve his brethren, that they &s;hould con|&s;ider him accordingly.</P>

ELDER Brown was of his mind; but Deacon Sa|muel Win&s;or took the lead of a party, who were re|&s;olutely &s;et again&s;t what the Governor had propo&s;|ed. A Council was called there, September 3, 1731, who advi&s;ed them not to divide upon it; but at a meeting in October, Win&s;or and his party were for cen&s;uring Walton as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, for joining in prayer with Bapti&s;ts who were not under hands. Elder Brown rea&s;oned with them upon it, and &s;aid, "If we admoni&s;h brother Walton and &s;et him apart, what will you do with others who hold that point as he does, as Elder Clarke, Elder Wightman, the Governor, and &s;ome others?" Their an&s;wer was, "That we mu&s;t go through with it." And Elder Peter Place, of Smithfield, came and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making an open &s;eparation in Provi|dence church upon the&s;e points. And Win&s;or taught publicly, "That all tho&s;e who took any thing for preaching were like Simon Magus." This ac|count is taken from original writings of Elder Brown and others, now before me. And as he died Octo|ber 28, 1732, aet. 66<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was grand&s;on to Chad Brown, one of the fir&s;t planters of Providence; and &s;on to John Brown, who was elected into their Council in 1665, and was afterwards an elder in Providence church. From Elder James Brown's &s;on James &s;prang the four brothers who are now very noted traders in Providence, and great promoters of learning, and of the Bapti&s;t cau&s;e there. Said elder's &s;on Eli&s;ha was Deputy-Governor of the Colony in 1765, and his &s;on Andrew was Ju&s;tice of Peace in the State, and long an exemplary Chri&s;tian in the Bapti&s;t church in Glouce&s;ter, until he died in peace, 1782.</NOTE>, Win&s;or's party prevailed, and ordained him as the mini&s;ter of that church. Walton quitted the mini&s;try, and followed other employments, whereby many were confirmed in their prejudices again&s;t him and his &s;entiments.</P>
<P N="4">IV. PERHAPS a conci&s;e account of a piece of villainy, which was now detected at Swanzey, may
<PB N="117" REF="018336_0132_0FA5D244B618C910">be of &s;ervice, to warn all others again&s;t doing the like. That town was fir&s;t granted to five men, three of whom were Bapti&s;ts; and they laid out &s;undry par|cels of land, which they called pa&s;tors and teachers lots. They had a large and curious book of church records, which was brought from Wales; and the &s;urveys of tho&s;e lots were recorded therein. Bar|rington was originally included in Swanzey, and when it became a di&s;tinct town, they had their &s;hare of tho&s;e lots for Pedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters. In 1718 Richard Harden became both a deacon and the clerk of the fir&s;t church in Swanzey; and was en|couraged to build and make improvements upon one of tho&s;e lots, near their meeting-hou&s;e; and he was al&s;o a leading man in town affairs. Having &s;uch advantages, he was tempted with a notion, that by de&s;troying the records of tho&s;e lots, he could ob|tain that whereon he lived as common land. And behold! all the records of Swanzey church, be|twixt 1663 and 1718 were taken out of the book, and have never been recovered &s;ince! When the church came to know it, as the government was in the hands of Pedobapti&s;ts, they invited Barrington to join with them in &s;uing for their rights, with an offer, that if they would be at proportionable ex|pence, they &s;hould have two fifths of what they re|covered. The offer was accepted, and Harden was &s;ued by a writ of ejectment, at the County Court, in July, 1730, and was ca&s;t. He appealed to the Su|perior Court in September; but was al&s;o ca&s;t there. By a reference the next year he obtained &pound; 125 for what he had done upon the land, and was obliged to quit it; and he took to keeping loo&s;e company, and drinking to exce&s;s. Elder Wheaton, and a large part of his church, had been de&s;irous of &s;et|tling Mr. Comer with him, before Comer went to
<PB N="118" REF="018336_0133_0FA5D2455E8051B0">Newport, but Harden's influence prevented it. O what is man when left to him&s;elf!</P>
<P N="5">V. THE pious and liberal Mr. Hollis died in 1731: When the news of it arrived, Dr. Coleman preached a funeral &s;ermon for him, before the Gene|ral Court at Bo&s;ton, April 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; which was publi&s;hed by their order. The two Profe&s;&s;ors upon his foun|dations in the college each publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e upon the occa&s;ion, and Pre&s;ident Wad&s;worth wrote a preface thereto. Profe&s;&s;or Wiggle&s;worth &s;ays, "By his frequent and ample benefactions, for the encouragement of theological as well as human knowledge among us, who are Chri&s;tians of a dif|ferent denomination from him&s;elf, he hath &s;et &s;uch an example of a generous, catholic and Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, as hath never before fallen within my ob&s;er|vation, nor, &s;o far as I now remember, within my reading." Dr. Coleman &s;ays, "That which is &s;in|gular in the piety and benefits of Mr. Hollis, unto the&s;e churches, was, that though he was not &s;trictly of our way, nor in judgment with us in the point of infant bapti&s;m, yet his heart and hand was the &s;ame to us, as if we had been one in opinion and prac|tice with him. And in this let him &s;tand a teach|ing pattern and example to us, of a noble, Chri&s;tian, apo&s;tolic &s;pirit of love; which makes tho&s;e that differ in le&s;&s;er matters to receive one another to the glory of God, and a &s;hining te&s;timony again&s;t a narrow party &s;pirit, which is &s;o much the di&s;grace and detriment of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and which &s;o early began among the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us, and was rebuked by him, even in John him&s;elf, that apo&s;tle of love and charity afterwards, who once &s;aid to Chri&s;t in a fret of zeal, Ma&s;ter, we &s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us, and we forbid him, becau&s;e he followeth not us: But

We &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to remember this hereafter. In the mean time, the la&s;t letter that I have &s;een from Mr. Hollis's intimate friend di&s;covers &s;o much of the views and comforts of Chri&s;tianity, in a near &s;ight of morta|lity, that I &s;hall annex it to the foregoing account.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I READILY own that it was my turn to have wrote to you long before now; but the long and threatening illne&s;s under which I have laboured, for more than twelve months pa&s;t, have &s;o reduced me, both in fle&s;h and &s;pirit, that I have been incapable great part of the time of writing; which will I hope plead my excu&s;e with you. I am, through divine goodne&s;s, able to preach once a day on Lord's days, but hardly ever expect to get over my indi&s;po&s;i|tion. It is a wonder to the doctors, and all others who &s;aw my ca&s;e, that I am alive. I could not for &s;everal months but expect to be removed; but ble&s;|&s;ed be the Lord, I had a comfortable pro&s;pect of another world, and was rather grieved than plea&s;ed at the view of a return into this. Here methinks is nothing plea&s;ant to the mind, but rather every thing &s;ullying and di&s;compo&s;ing: Why then &s;hould not tho&s;e who have ta&s;ted divine grace, long to &s;tretch and &s;wim in the immen&s;e ocean? How &s;weet is a drop here, therefore how ravi&s;hing mu&s;t the full enjoyment be! But Lord grant faith and patience, to wait thy time, even thy time, O Lord. I am glad to hear the baptized intere&s;t thrives, and wi&s;h that the power of religion were in a more flou|ri&s;hing condition with you than it is with us; for &s;urely Jacob is &s;mall and low. We have many
<PB N="120" REF="018336_0135_0FA5D247008DCCC8">controver&s;ies agitated, which &s;eem to put a &s;top to the growth of pure religion and the power of god|line&s;s among us. National vice gains &s;trength, but vital religion is declined to a mere &s;keleton; yet the Lord's arm is not &s;hortened.

<P N="6">VI. ALL his letters that I publi&s;h are care|fully copied from the originals now in my hands. He fini&s;hed his cour&s;e with joy, in his 55th year, June 12, 1733<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. page 394.</NOTE>. To return to our own hi&s;tory, I would ob&s;erve, that Rhode-I&s;land Colony was fir&s;t divided into three counties, in June, 1729; and in February, 1730, Providence was divi|ded into the towns of Providence, Smithfield, Glou|ce&s;ter, and Scituate. There were thirteen Bapti&s;t churches, mo&s;t of them &s;mall, who now held an|nual a&s;&s;ociations to promote di&s;cipline and com|munion among them, upon the &s;ix principles in Hebrews vi. viz. one in Providence, the &s;econd in Newport, two in Smithfield, the &s;econd in Swanzey, and one in each of the towns of Dartmouth, War|wick, North-King&s;town, South-King&s;town, Scitu|ate, Groton, New-London and New-York. The two in Connecticut had introduced &s;inging in public wor&s;hip, to promote which their Elder Wightman publi&s;hed a little pamphlet; but it was oppo&s;ed by many among other churches. One church in New|port held the keeping of the &s;eventh day &s;abbath as a bar of communion, and refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ordain|ing Mr. Comer in 1726, on that account. Mr. Mumford, who fir&s;t led them into that principle, introduced &s;inging among them in 1677. In that, and in their &s;i&s;ter church at We&s;terly, Comer &s;ays
<PB N="121" REF="018336_0136_0FA5D24C53D69D00">were now about one hundred and forty commu|nicants; and al&s;o that general redemption was held by the majority of all tho&s;e fifteen churches. The fir&s;t church in Newport had now about fifty mem|bers, the fir&s;t in Swanzey two hundred, and their &s;i&s;ter church in Bo&s;ton eighty. The&s;e held to par|ticular election, and did not make laying on of hands a bar of communion, and &s;ang in public wor|&s;hip; and the above named were all the Bapti&s;t churches then extant, north of New-Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P N="7">VII. MR. Comer had held a corre&s;pondence by letter with mini&s;ters in New-Jer&s;ey for &s;everal years; and in March, 1731, he went there by water, and vi&s;ited their churches in Middletown, Pi&s;cataqua, Cohan&s;ey, &amp;c. He went as far as Philadelphia; and upon his return declared great &s;atisfaction, in the &s;ight he had of the faith and order of tho&s;e churches. On July 3 he &s;aid, "I de&s;ired and obtained a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church where I had preached more than two years, becau&s;e I was never &s;ettled there, and found that &s;ome could not bear my preaching the doctrines of grace." In Augu&s;t he removed to Rehoboth, where on January 1, 1732, he &s;aid, "I begin a new year, in a new place, but not in a new employment; for my delight of &s;oul is in &s;erving my dear Redeemer in the &s;acred work of the mini&s;try; which I prefer and e&s;teem above and beyond every thing el&s;e; though I ac|knowledge unfit and unworthy in my&s;elf. Lord, who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e thing! My &s;ufficiency is alone of God, in whom I re&s;t and rely continually. January 20, a Bapti&s;t church was gathered in Re|hoboth; and January 26 I was publicly in&s;talled pa&s;tor of it. Elder Ephraim Wheaton of Swanzey preached from 1 The&s;&s;. v. 12, 13, and gave me the right hand of fellow&s;hip." And a precious num|ber
<PB N="122" REF="018336_0137_0FA5D24E55CEE6A8">of &s;ouls were hopefully converted under his mi|ni&s;try there. In June he vi&s;ited Sutton and Leice&s;|ter, and baptized Thomas Richard&s;on, Daniel Denny, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> brother to Mr. Prince's wife of Bo&s;ton, and &s;ix more. In July he preached and baptized a man in Middleborough. November 30 he bap|tized fifteen per&s;ons at home, who were chiefly &s;eals of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Two learned mini&s;ters were now &s;ettled in New|port. Mr. John Callender, nephew to their mini|&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, who had enjoyed the benefit of Mr. Hollis's donations in Harvard college, was ordain|ed a pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church in Newport, October 13, 1731, colleague with Elder Packom, who died three years after. Mr. Nicholas Eyres, who was born in Wilt&s;hire, Augu&s;t 22, 1691, and educated in the city of Bri&s;tol, became a Bapti&s;t after he came over to New-York; and he was ordained pa&s;tor of a &s;mall Bapti&s;t church there in 1724, by the two Elder Wightman's. A collection was made in Newport, Providence, &amp;c. to help them in build|ing a meeting-hou&s;e in that city. But in 1730 the church became much broken; Eyres &s;ays, "Some of them de&s;erted, under a pretence of love to the principles of ab&s;olute election and prede&s;ti|nation." Therefore he came and &s;ettled at New|port in October, 1731, colleague with Elder Wight|man. Elder James Clarke, of that church, died December 1, 1736, aet. 88, much e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who knew him.</P>
<P>MR. James Bound, a &s;en&s;ible Bapti&s;t, came over from England, and dwelt a while in Salem village, now Danvers, where Mr. Peter Clark was mini|&s;ter; who could not be content with per&s;onal di&s;|pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, but al&s;o frequently preached again&s;t the Bap|ti&s;t principles, when there were no others in the place,
<PB N="123" REF="018336_0138_0FA5D24E778257A8">that held them. Bound told him that it was an un|fair way of treating mankind; but he per&s;i&s;ted in it, until he turned a number of his people from his own way, who removed, and began a Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Sutton. Mr. Bound's &s;on John married a mem|ber of Mr. Clark's church, and removed to that town, where the preaching of Sutton mini&s;ter for infant bapti&s;m turned her from it; and when Clark heard thereof, he wrote her a long letter upon the &s;ubject. This &s;he communicated to Mr. Walton, and he wrote an an&s;wer thereto, and &s;ent it in a &s;ealed letter to Mrs. Bound. But by &s;ome means Clark got it into his hands, and publi&s;hed both letters, with animadver&s;ions thereon, in 1732. She told me that &s;he never &s;aw Walton's letter to her, till &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw it in print. How well this agrees with the gentleman, or the Chri&s;tian, the reader will judge.</P>
<P>IN December, 1731, an act was pa&s;&s;ed in Bo&s;ton, for the Quakers only; which left out the affirma|tion, and five mile limitation, and required the a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors in each pari&s;h, where any Quakers lived, to take an annual li&s;t of them, and to deliver it to their pari&s;h clerk by the 20th of July; and if any of them &s;hould happen to be omitted therein, two principal members of the Quaker &s;ociety might certify the &s;ame to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors by the 10th of Augu&s;t; and they &s;hould al&s;o be exempted from taxes to the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. As the exempting laws for Bapti&s;ts expired in 1733, Mr. Comer's people were immediately taxed to other teachers; and &s;ome of them were impri&s;oned therefor. But upon appli|cation to their Legi&s;lature they were relea&s;ed, in 1734; and a like law was made for the Bapti&s;ts as had lately been for the Quakers; though no pen|alty was laid upon their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, for breaking tho&s;e laws, which they frequently did.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="018336_0139_0FA5D24F1EB80380">
THE Bapti&s;t churches in Swanzey and Rehoboth met with &s;ore bereavements in 1734; when Elder Wheaton died April 26, aet. 75; and Mr. Comer the 23d of May following, before he had compleat|ed his 30th year. But how much did he do in a little time! A decline immediately followed, from which neither of tho&s;e churches have &s;ully return|ed to this day; though the fir&s;t of them has lately done &s;o in a great mea&s;ure. On September 16, 1735, a Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted at Sut|ton; and September 28, 1737, Benj. Mar&s;h and Thomas Green were ordained joint pa&s;tors of it. The former was from Salem, and the latter from Malden; being an early planter in Leice&s;ter. And September 28, 1738, by mutual agreement, the brethren at Leice&s;ter became a church by them|&s;elves, and Green their pa&s;tor.

<P>MARCH 24, 1738, a century after the deed of Rhode-I&s;land was given, by the Narragan&s;et In|dians, Mr. John Callender delivered a &s;ermon at Newport, which he publi&s;hed, with enlargements, containing the be&s;t hi&s;tory of that Colony then ex|tant. But his uncle at Bo&s;ton was taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om his beloved flock the la&s;t day of that month; and he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in the following happy manner.
<PB N="125" REF="018336_0140_0FA5D24FE457FC50">March 21 he &s;aid, "When I look on one hand, I &s;ee nothing but &s;in, guilt and di&s;couragement: But when I look on the other, I &s;ee my glorious Sa|viour, and the merits of his precious blood, which clean&s;eth from all &s;in.

<P>MR. Jeremiah Condy, who took his fir&s;t degree at Harvard college in 1726, after preaching a while in this country, went over to England; but he was now &s;ent for from thence, and was ordained pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, February 14, 1739. The third Bapti&s;t church in Connecti|cut was con&s;tituted and origanized the &s;ame year in Wallingford. By reading Delaune's plea for the nonconformi&s;ts, and other means, a number of people there were brought to embrace their &s;en|timents, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church in New-London;
<PB N="126" REF="018336_0141_0FA5D251B4CE8248">but ordinarily met for wor&s;hip at Wal|lingford, from 1731 till they had a regular di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion on Augu&s;t 20, 1739; and after being formed into a di&s;tinct church, ordained Mr. John Mer|riman for their pa&s;tor. Mr. Edward Upham, of Malden, &s;on to a member of the Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, took his fir&s;t degree at Harvard college in 1734; and after preaching at Springfield about two years, a church was con&s;tituted there October 14, 1740, and the next day he was ordained their pa&s;tor, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Condy, and Mr. John Callender.</P>
<P>THE exempting law for Bapti&s;ts had again ex|pired, and their church in Rehoboth, being afraid of further trouble, reque&s;ted the town to vote them clear. This was con&s;idered of at a town-meeting January 24, 1740, when it was declared that they could not lawfully do it; yet at another meeting February 13, they voted, "That they were wil|ling to grant or agree upon a &s;alary for the mini&s;ter of the Bapti&s;t church the pre&s;ent year, in ca&s;e the &s;aid elder will accept thereof." For this they had no more law than the other, and it was evidently done to en&s;nare them if po&s;&s;ible. In May following &s;aid exempting law was revived, to continue &s;even years.</P>

<P N="1">I. A VERY great change is before us, which &s;ome have called the great reformation, and others great confu&s;ion; which diver&s;ity of opi|nion is no new thing. Concerning the founder of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>&s;ome &s;aid he is a good man; others &s;aid, nay, but he deceiveth the people.</HI> In 1680 a &s;ermon was delivered before the corporation of the city of London, wherein the di&s;&s;enters were accu&s;ed of ob&s;tructing the cau&s;e of reformation, becau&s;e they would not conform to the national wor&s;hip; and recour&s;e was had to the &s;everities, of Congregation|ali&s;ts in New-England, again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts and others, to ju&s;tify the &s;everities that were exer|ci&s;ed towards di&s;&s;enters in England. Therefore Dr. Owen publi&s;hed a book in 1681, wherein he ob&s;erves, that all the reformation that has taken place &s;ince the ri&s;e of Antichri&s;t, was produced en|tirely by the&s;e three principles, viz. taking the holy &s;criptures as their only perfect rule in all reli|gious matters; allowing each rational per&s;on to

<P N="2">II. BUT God ever works like him&s;elf, even &s;o as to demon&s;trate to all, that our help is in him, and not in any arm of fle&s;h. Mr. Stoddard's doctrine had greatly prevailed in this country before his de|cea&s;e, February 11, 1729. His grand&s;on Edward was &s;ettled a colleague with him two years before;
<PB N="130" REF="018336_0145_0FA5D2545762B5A8">who has &s;ince been a chief in&s;trument of reforma|tion in our times. A revival of religion began under his mini&s;try, near the clo&s;e of 1733, which aro&s;e to &s;uch an heighth in the &s;pring of 1735, that he entertained hopes of about thirty conver|&s;ions among his people in a week, for &s;ix weeks together; &s;o that &s;carce a grown per&s;on in the place remained unaffected, and many children were effectually called. Our elder Clark of Wilbra|ham dates his conver&s;ion there, at that time, when about twelve years old. This work was power|ful in &s;everal adjacent towns; and they had a le&s;s degree of it in a number of towns in Connecticut.

<P N="4">IV. SOME indeed tried to per&s;uade the world, that the great change then made in the land was chiefly owing to the mechanical influence of their terrible words, ge&s;tures, and moving ways of ad|dre&s;s. Dr. Chauncy took much pains to put this colour upon things. But Mr. Thomas Prince &s;ays, "As to Mr. Whitefield's preaching, it was, in the manner, moving, earne&s;t, winning and melting; but the mechanical influence of this, according to the u&s;ual operation of mechanical powers, in two or three days expired, with many in two or three hours; and I believe with mo&s;t as &s;oon as the &s;ound was over, or they got out of the hou&s;e, or in the fir&s;t conver&s;ation they fell into. But with the <HI>manner</HI> of his preach|ing, wherein he appeared to be <HI>in earne&s;t,</HI> he de|livered tho&s;e <HI>vital truths</HI> which animated all our martyrs, made them triumph in flames, and led his hearers into the view of that vital, inward, active piety, which is the meer effect of that mighty &s;u|pernatural operation of a DIVINE POWER on the &s;ouls of men; which only will &s;upport and carr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> through the &s;harpe&s;t trials, and make meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light." Of Mr. Ten|nent Mr. Prince &s;ays, "In private conver&s;e with him, I found him to be a man of con&s;iderable parts and learning; free, gentle and conde&s;cending; and from his own various experience, reading the mo&s;t noted writers on experimental divinity, as well as

<P N="5">V. MARCH 2, 1741, Mr. Tennent preached his farewell &s;ermon at Bo&s;ton, and came round by Plymouth, Middleborough, Bridgewater, Taunton, Newport and Providence, and &s;o returned home through Connecticut; in all which places his la|bours had &s;ome good effect. Religion was much revived in Bo&s;ton, Northampton, and places ad|jacent, in the fall and winter. In February and March, it was &s;o in New-Haven, Hebron, and Le|banon-Crank. At their general election in May, Mr. Jedidiah Mills preached in a powerful manner at Hartford, from whence his fame &s;pread exten|&s;ively. Proceeding ea&s;tward in his labours, Dr. Benjamin Lord, of Norwich, hearing when he was to preach at Lebanon, ventured to appoint a lec|ture for him in his own pulpit on Tue&s;day, June 2; but Mr. Mills was otherways engaged, and Mr. Wheelock came and preached it; and Mr. Mills came and preached there twice the Friday follow|ing. The&s;e were the fir&s;t that I heard of tho&s;e iti|nerant
<PB N="134" REF="018336_0149_0FA5D2575647F2F0">mini&s;ters. Such darkne&s;s had prevailed be|fore, and many &s;pake &s;o freely of the light they now received, that the name of NEWLIGHTS was &s;oon can upon them. But an old &s;aint, who was con|verted under Mr. Flavel's mini&s;try in England, but now lived at our Norwich, being a&s;ked what &s;he thought of them? readily replied, "Newlights! It is new to &s;uch as never &s;aw it before; but it is what I knew above fifty years ago." The work prevailed very powerfully in Norwich through the &s;ummer. In Augu&s;t Mr. James Devenport from Long-I&s;land came there, where Mr. Eleazer Wheelock and Mr. Benjamin Pomroy met him, and they laboured ince&s;&s;antly for three days, and a great reformation was wrought in the town; and in this and the fol|lowing year, that glorious work of divine grace pre|vailed, in a greater or le&s;s degree, in mo&s;t parts of New-England, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;yl|vania, and many other places. A mea&s;ure of it was granted to the Bapti&s;ts in Bo&s;ton, Leice&s;ter, Brim|field, Newport<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Betwixt March and Augu&s;t, 1741, forty-eight per&s;ons were baptized, and joined to the &s;econd church in Newport.</NOTE>, Gorton and Wallingford; but as the work was begun and carried on almo&s;t wholly by Pedobapti&s;ts, from which denomination their fathers had &s;uffered much, mo&s;t of the Bapti&s;ts were prejudiced again&s;t the work, and again&s;t the Cal|vinian doctrine by which it was promoted. Though I find that Elder Robert Feke, of Oy&s;terbay, on Long-I&s;land, wrote to his brethren in Newport, November 29, 1741, and &s;aid, "God has begun a glorious work among us, and I hope he will carry it on.

VI. ALL allow that many imperfections attend|ed this revival of religion; but the great difficulty has been to determine what they were, &s;o as to en|courage what was right, and to guard again&s;t all that was not &s;o. Mr. Edwards delivered a &s;ermon upon this &s;ubject at New-Haven, in September, 1741, which he enlarged and publi&s;hed, with a pre|face by Mr. William Cooper, of Bo&s;ton; and it cir|culated through the nation, and was much e&s;teem|ed. But an anonymous an&s;wer to it was publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This an&s;wer was commended, it not wrote, by Dr. Chaun|cy. See Chauncy's thoughts, p. 332.</NOTE>, which condemned Mr. Cooper's &s;aying "Some of the <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>knowing</HI> among men have had tho&s;e things revealed to them of the Father in heaven, which fle&s;h and blood doth not teach." This writer &s;aid he could not gue&s;s who they &s;hould be. To which it may be replied, that Mr. Wil|liam Hobby, of Reading, one of the eleven &s;igners to the paper in favour of O&s;born's Arminiani&s;m, Mr. Daniel Rogers, a tutor at Harvard college, and a number more of their teachers, freely confe&s;&s;ed that they were blind guides, until they were &s;aving|ly enlightened under Mr. Whitefield's preaching. Said writer di&s;covered a great di&s;like of Cooper's &s;aying "The&s;e fruits do not grow on <HI>Arminian</HI> ground:" And al&s;o of What Edwards wrote again&s;t unregenerate mini&s;ters. As no law could take place in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, without the con&s;ent of Epi&s;|copalians, Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters could not carry their power &s;o far there as in Connecticut, where the whole power of making laws was in one deno|mination, who therefore improved their power in the following manner.</P>

And, by an order from their legi&s;lature, a general Con&s;ociation from all the counties of that Colony met at Guilford, November 24, and drew up &s;undry re&s;olves; in one of which they &s;ay, "That for a mini&s;ter to enter in|to another mini&s;ter's pari&s;h, and preach or admini|&s;ter the &s;eals of the covenant, without the con&s;ent of or in oppo&s;ition to the &s;ettled mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, is <HI>di&s;orderly.</HI>" Mr. Robbins of Branford had done &s;o at New-Haven before, for which other mini&s;ters had reproved him, and he had made &s;ome conce&s;|&s;ions to them therefor. In December he received a written reque&s;t from the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in Walling|ford, informing him, that Dr. Bellamy had preach|ed in their &s;ociety to mutual &s;atisfaction, and de&s;ir|ed that he would come and do the like. This re|que&s;t appeared agreeable, and he appointed a meet|ing for the purpo&s;e, January 6, 1742. But, two days before the time, a deacon from Wallingford brought him two letters, the one &s;igned by forty-two men of that town, the other &s;igned by Jacob Hemenway and I&s;aac Stiles, mini&s;ters who lived by the way, reque&s;ting him not to go and preach to tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts, without giving any rea&s;on again&s;t it, but only their de&s;ire. This did not appear to him a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for him to violate his promi&s;e, and to di&s;appoint a people who were de&s;irous of hearing the go&s;pel. He therefore went and preach|ed two &s;ermons there, with an evident good effect. Yet for &s;o doing he was complained of as a <HI>di&s;or|derly</HI> per&s;on, to the Con&s;ociation of New-Haven county, in their meeting of February 9. He en|quired wherein the di&s;order lay, &s;eeing he preach|ed in a particular &s;ociety, at the written reque&s;t of their pa&s;tor? It was an&s;wered, that &s;aid &s;ociety was

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. MR. Devenport derived his de&s;cent from the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of New-Haven, and was &s;on of a mini&s;ter of Stamford, in Fairfield county. He and Mr. Daniel Bli&s;s, a lively mini|&s;ter at Concord, took their fir&s;t degrees at Yale college in 1732, as Mr. Wheelock and Mr. Pomroy did theirs in 1733, and Timothy Allen his in 1736; who all dated their conver&s;ions before the&s;e times. Allen was ordained at We&s;t-Haven; but upon uttering &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, about how unprofitable the &s;criptures were to the unregene|rate, their Con&s;ociation depo&s;ed him from his office. Devenport was an in&s;trument of great awakenings in many places; and no man before him ever la|boured to &s;o good purpo&s;e as he did, among the Mohegan and Nyantic Indians; from whence al&s;o &s;prang a great work among the Narragan&s;ets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners at Bo&s;ton, for &s;ending out and &s;upport|ing mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indians, &s;ent Mr. Jo&s;eph Park to We&s;terly, upon that bu&s;ine&s;s, in 1733. In 1738 the ea&s;t part of that town, where the Narragan&s;ets chiefly re&s;ided, was &s;et off by the name of Charle&s;town. But in nine years, he was not able to bring one Engli&s;h family, in tho&s;e two towns, to &s;et up family wor&s;hip; nor above a dozen Indians to attend on his mi|ni&s;try: Until, being greatly enlightened him&s;elf, by means of tho&s;e itinerant mini&s;ters, a revival began among his people, and a church of 14 Engli&s;h members was formed in May, 1742; which was &s;ucceeded with &s;o great a work among the Indians the next year, as brought many of them into that church, and an hundred of them u&s;ually to attend on his mini&s;try. <HI>Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory,</HI> vol. 1, p. 202&mdash;210. Mr. Park died there March 1, 1777.</P>
<P>Stephen Babcock, a member of that church, became the pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church in 1750, and continued &s;o until his death in 1775.</P></NOTE>.
<PB N="145" REF="018336_0160_0FA5D265141F9C80">But having always lived among mini&s;ters who claimed a like power in the Chri&s;tian church, as the &s;eed of Aaron had in that of the Jews; and being deeply &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;chiefs which unconverted teachers do to precious &s;ouls, he imbibed a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion, that it was his duy to examine the mini|&s;ters wherever he came, and to warn the people again&s;t hearing &s;uch as he judged to be blind guides. For the&s;e things he was taken up and brought be|fore Connecticut Legi&s;lature, who &s;ent him out of their Colony. Separations were hereby cau&s;ed at New-London, New-Haven, and Milford. And it was impre&s;&s;ed upon &s;undry minds, that they mu&s;t <HI>go their way forth,</HI> and erect a <HI>&s;hepherd's tent</HI> at New-London, to educate per&s;ons in for the mini|&s;try. Such a &s;chool was therefore opened, to which a number re&s;orted, wherein Allen pre&s;ided. And though he was once impri&s;oned for preaching, and others &s;uffered much, it did but animate them the more. And Devenport mu&s;t needs go and preach to the great metropolis of New-England. Upon his arrival he had long conferences with the mini|&s;ters of Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town; until on July 1,
<PB N="146" REF="018336_0161_0FA5D265BAF96598">1742, mo&s;t of them &s;igned a declaration, wherein they &s;aid, "He appears to us to be truly pious, and we hope God has u&s;ed him as an in&s;trument of good to many &s;ouls; yet we judge it our duty to bear te&s;|timony again&s;t the following particulars. 1. His being acted much by &s;udden <HI>impul&s;es.</HI> 2. His judg|ing &s;ome mini&s;ters in Long-I&s;land and New-Eng|land to be unconverted; and thinking him&s;elf cal|led of God to <HI>demand</HI> of his brethren, from place to place, and account of their regenerate &s;tate, when or in what manner the Holy Spirit wrought upon and renewed them. 3. His going with his friends, &s;ing|ing through the &s;treets and highways, to and from the hou&s;es of wor&s;hip, on Lord's days and other days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this way of &s;inging he was almo&s;t entirely &s;ingular, even from tho&s;e who were otherwi&s;e engaged with him in the general cau&s;e.</NOTE>. 4.

But this did not prevent his going to examine each of them, and then declaring publicly again&s;t them; naming &s;ome as unconverted, and comparing others to Je|ho&s;aphat in Ahab's army, and calling the people to &s;eparate from them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, vol. 2, p. 406&mdash;408.</NOTE>. He proceeded farther ea&s;t|ward in this way, and upon his return to Bo&s;ton in Augu&s;t he was impri&s;oned and brought upon trial in Court, for &s;landering their mini&s;ters, but the jury judged him to be <HI>non compos mentis,</HI> and &s;o ac|quitted him<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Chauncy's thoughts, p. 164. 165.</NOTE>. Separations hereupon took place in Bo&s;ton, Ip&s;wich and Newbury. After his return to Long-I&s;land, he was brought over to New-London;
<PB N="147" REF="018336_0162_0FA5D26735A90F80">where he and others were carried &s;o far, under a no|tion of purging away all error, as to burn a con&s;ider|able pile of books, that in their view were erroneous, near the town wharff, on Lord's day, March 6, 1743, ju&s;t as people were returning from public wor&s;hip. Norcott upon bapti&s;m was ca&s;t into the pile, but was catched out by another hand. The next day, under a conceit of de&s;troying idolatry, they collected a large heap of fine cloaths and or|naments, but were hindered from burning of them, partly by a gentleman's coming to Devenport, and a&s;&s;uring him, that if all he had idolized mu&s;t be burnt, he mu&s;t burn him fir&s;t. Great confu&s;ion was cau&s;ed by the&s;e things, and the &s;hepherd's tent broke up &s;oon after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Prince and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for began a weekly publication, and continued it for two years, under the name of <HI>The Chri&s;tian Hi&s;tory;</HI> which is very &s;erviceable in ours.</NOTE>.</P>

And they had now got &s;o much of it, as emboldened them to appear very openly again&s;t the work in this land. The annual convention of mini&s;ters at Bo&s;ton, May 25, publi&s;hed their te&s;timony upon this &s;ubject; and e&s;pecially again&s;t "The &s;pirit and practice of &s;eparation, from the particular flocks to which per&s;ons belong, to join with and &s;upport <HI>lay-exhorters or itinerants</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chauncy's thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE>." This moved &s;ome friends to the late revival to publi&s;h an invitation, in the Bo&s;ton papers, to all mini&s;ters who had favourable thoughts of that work, to meet there the day after the en&s;uing commencement at Cambridge, to give their minds concerning it; and &s;uch as could not well come, were de&s;ired to &s;end in their thoughts in writing. In an&s;wer to

But twenty of them went off, and did not &s;tay to hear it. Of tho&s;e who &s;tayed, forty-four &s;igned it without re&s;erve; wherein they te&s;tify, that a glorious work of divine grace had been wrought in this land, in the three preceding years; but advi&s;e, "That <HI>laymen</HI> do not invade the mini&s;terial office, and, under a pre|tence of exhorting, &s;et up preaching; which (&s;ay they) is very contrary to go&s;pel order, and tends to introduce errors and confu&s;ion into the church|es. That mini&s;ters do not invade the province of others, and, <HI>in ordinary ca&s;es,</HI> preach in another's pari&s;h without his knowledge, and again&s;t his con|&s;ent." Fifteen more &s;igned it, with an exception in the&s;e words, viz. "We concur with the te&s;timony, for the &s;ub&s;tance of it, excepting that article of itinerancy, or mini&s;ters and others intruding into other mini&s;ters pari&s;hes without their con&s;ent, which <HI>great di&s;order</HI> we apprehend not &s;ufficiently te&s;tified againt therein." At the head of the&s;e was Dr. Colman; who twelve years before called it a fret of zeal, and a narrow party &s;pirit, in the apo&s;tle John, to de&s;ire our Saviour him&s;elf to for|bid others, becau&s;e, &s;aid John, <HI>they follow not us.</HI> The other &s;igners to this exception were Checkley and Eliot of Bo&s;ton, Fowle of Hingham, Baxter of Medfield, Carpenter of Hull, Brad&s;treet of Marblehead, Abbot and Prentice of Charle&s;town, Turell of Medford, Dorr of Mendon, Parkman of We&s;tborough, Eells of Scituate, Ba&s;s of Hano|ver, and Maccarty of King&s;ton.

James Bound, John Dabny, and Tho|mas Boucher, from Britain, which John Proctor, a town &s;chool-ma&s;ter in Bo&s;ton, members of the Bap|ti&s;t church there, withdrew from it, and began ano|ther church in July; and Mr. Ephraim Bound (&s;on to James) was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 7, 1743. The rea&s;ons of their withdraw were becau&s;e Mr. Condy taught Arminian doctrine, con|trary to the original principles of the church, and al&s;o oppo&s;ed the late work of God in the land. Philip Freeman, member of a Bapti&s;t church in London, came over to Bo&s;ton, and joined to that new church; who &s;ent an account of their princi|ples and conduct to Dr. John Gill, which obtained his approbation, and a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent was &s;ent
<PB N="150" REF="018336_0165_0FA5D2696C9D4B90">them from London. The increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;ts in New-Jer&s;ey &s;oon after moved Mr. Jonathan Dick|in&s;on, the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of their college, to write a dialogue upon infant bapti&s;m. It was printed both at New-York and Bo&s;ton in 1746, but without any name to it. Mr. Freeman &s;ent one of them to Dr. Gill, with a reque&s;t that he would an&s;wer it. He did &s;o in 1749, and began with the&s;e words, viz. "Many being converted under the mini&s;try of the word in New-England, and enlightened into the or|dinance of believers bapti&s;m, whereby the churches of the Bapti&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion at Bo&s;ton and in the country have been encrea&s;ed, has alarmed the Pedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters of the Colony; who have applied to one Mr. Dickin&s;on, a country mini&s;ter, who, as my cor|re&s;pondent informs me, has wrote with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Arminians, to write in favour of infant &s;prinkling." In 1752 Mr. Clark (who wrote again&s;t Walton twenty years before) publi&s;hed a reply to Gill, wherein he &s;aid, "In this introductory pa&s;&s;age, there are &s;everal gro&s;s mi&s;takes in fact, or manife&s;t <HI>untruths.</HI>" And he takes up above five pages, in trying to prove this charge; thinking, undoubt|edly, that if he could prove him to be a fal&s;e man in his introduction, his book might more ea&s;ily be an&s;wered, in the opinion of mo&s;t; who generally have <HI>men's per&s;ons in admiration becau&s;e of advantage.</HI> He allows that Dickin&s;on wrote again&s;t the <HI>Secta|ries,</HI> and names as &s;uch the Quakers, Anabapti&s;ts, Arminians and Antinomians; not mentioning that him&s;elf was one of the eleven &s;igners of the paper in favour of O&s;born's Arminiani&s;m in 1740. The proofs for his charge again&s;t Gill con&s;i&s;t in limit|ing his words to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in&s;tead of all New-England, and denying any great increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;ts, &s;o as to alarm the mini&s;ters; or that

Gill was never here, and therefore might ea&s;ily mi&s;take the geography of the country; but his accu&s;er was born and educated in it; and he &s;ays of that new church, "They have &s;et up an illiterate teacher. To this &s;eparate &s;ociety there have been, indeed, &s;ome few enthu&s;ia&s;ts and &s;eparati&s;ts from &s;ome churches in Bo&s;ton, and from the adjacent parts of the country, who have joined them&s;elves.&mdash;Be&s;ides&mdash;I know of no other Bapti&s;t church, except at the out-&s;kirts of the Province to|wards Rhode-I&s;land and Providence, where I am informed there are two or three &s;ocieties that call them&s;elves Bapti&s;t churches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clark again&s;t Gill, p. 1&mdash;6.</NOTE> Whereas, at the time when he wrote thus, there were two Bapti&s;t churches in Bo&s;ton, two in Swanzey, two in Reho|both, and one in each of the towns of Bellingham, Sutton, Leice&s;ter, Sturbridge, Brimfield and Spring|field. And how guilty mu&s;t a man be, thus to mi&s;|repre&s;ent the &s;tate of his own Province, in order to fix an odium upon a gentleman who never was in it! He unju&s;tly accu&s;ed him of holding conver|&s;ion to be to a particular &s;ect; but how many re|proachful names does him&s;elf ca&s;t upon di&s;&s;enters from his own &s;ect? Arminians is one of tho&s;e names; whereas the large&s;t addition to &s;aid church in Bo&s;ton, that they had received from any one town in the country, was of a number of judicious Chri&s;|tians in Medfield, who refu&s;ed to join in the &s;ettle|ment of an Arminian mini&s;ter there, who has &s;ince been forced to re&s;ign his office, becau&s;e of his hav|ing a child by his maid. After the great earth|quake November 18, 1755, Mr. Bound's lectures were flocked to from all parts of the town; and

<P N="4">IV. IN 1742, Mr. Edwards publi&s;hed his thoughts, in five parts; &s;hewing that the work going on in the land was a glorious work of God; the duty of all to acknowledge and promote it, and the great danger of the contrary; wherein its friends had been injuriou&s;ly blamed; what ought to be corrected among them, and what po&s;itively ought to be done to promote the work. Upon a view of which Dr. Chauncy &s;et off and travelled through New-England, New-York and New-Jer|&s;ey, to collect matter for an an&s;wer to him, which was publi&s;hed this year, with the names of three Governors, two Lieut. Governors, many Coun|&s;ellors, and in all above &s;even hundred men as &s;ub&s;cribers for it. Above 300 pages in the book are taken up upon things that he &s;aid were of a bad and dangerous tendency in the land. He ranks them under eight heads, namely, itinerant preach|ing, great terrors, &s;udden light and joy, cen&s;ur|ing of others, impul&s;es, confounding of many ex|erci&s;es together, and a &s;pirit of error. Under which la&s;t head, eight particulars are named, viz. Holding that unconverted mini&s;ters could not convert others, &s;eparations, pre&s;umptuous depend|ing upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit, a&s;&s;urance of conver&s;ion, and of the time of it, vilifying good works, and not allowing &s;anctification to be an evidence of ju&s;tification. And le&s;t all the bad &s;tories he had raked together, from every part of America, &s;hould fail of cloathing tho&s;e points with a garb &s;ufficiently odious, a number are added
<PB N="153" REF="018336_0168_0FA5D26C8E108A48">thereto from Europe, and &s;ome from the dregs of Popery. A touch upon what he &s;ays, about itinerant preaching, and ra&s;h judging, may give &s;ome idea how &s;trong his arguments were.&mdash; Again&s;t the former he brings 2 The&s;. iii. 10-15, 1 Pet. iv. 15, and 2 Cor. x. 12-17; which con|demn the eating of other men's bread for naught, acting as bu&s;y-bodies in other men's matters, and the commending of them&s;elves, and going into another man's line, of things made ready to our hands. But by whom is this line drawn? by God or man? Teachers who are fond of &s;upport by tax and compul&s;ion, and promote the u&s;e of vio|lence towards &s;uch as <HI>follow not them,</HI> mo&s;t evidently fall under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h of the&s;e &s;criptures. According to Chauncy, ra&s;h and uncharitable judging was begun in the&s;e parts by Mr. Whitefield, "Who &s;eldom preached, but he had &s;omething or other in his &s;ermon again&s;t unconverted mini&s;ters." And why was this uncharitable? Becau&s;e Dr. Cot|ton Mather &s;aid, "No man becomes a mini&s;ter or a communicant in our churches, until he hath been &s;everely examined about his <HI>regeneration,</HI> as well as conver&s;ation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>." When was it &s;o? This te&s;timony was given in 1696; and how clearly does it prove, that their practice remained the &s;ame in 1740! His other arguments are alike conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P N="5">V. CONNECTICUT had a more powerful way of rea&s;oning. In October, 1742, they forbid the erection of any public place of education, without licence from authority; and al&s;o debarred all teach|ers from any benefit of their laws for their &s;upport, who had not been graduated by &s;ome Prote&s;tant col|lege. And on February 16 they i&s;&s;ued a procla|mation for a general fa&s;t, to be on April 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<PB N="154" REF="018336_0169_0FA5D26D689AF178">to deprecate the judgments of heaven, for them iniquities; "Particularly the great neglect and contempt of the go&s;pel and the mini&s;try thereof, and the prevailing of a &s;pirit of error, di&s;order, unpeaceablene&s;s, pride, bitterne&s;s, uncharitable|ne&s;s, cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, di&s;obedience, calumniating and reviling of authority, divi&s;ions, contentions, &s;eparations and confu&s;ions in churches; inju&s;tice, idlene&s;s, evil-&s;peaking, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, and all other vices and impieties which abound among us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 295, 296.</NOTE>:" Which was i&s;&s;ued early enough to have influence in the choice of their Legi&s;lature. Col. Hezekiah Huntington had been a member of their Council for three years; but at their election at Hartford, May 12, he was left out of it; and John Bulkley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was cho&s;en in his &s;tead, who &s;ent Zebulon Waterman and others, of Colche&s;ter, to Hartford gaol the &s;ummer before, for teaching and exhort|ing at a religious meeting. Waterman was &s;oon after ordained the pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church in Col|che&s;ter. It was well known that Huntington was much engaged in the late revival of religion in the land, and that he openly te&s;tified again&s;t the per|&s;ecutions therein. King William's act of toler|ation was adopted in Connecticut, in May, 1708, ju&s;t before their Saybrook &s;cheme was formed. But becau&s;e it had been extended, by their Coun|ty Court, to the di&s;&s;enters in New-Haven and Milford, it was now repealed, with a declaration, "That tho&s;e commonly called Pre&s;byterians or Congregationali&s;ts &s;hall not take benefit of &s;aid law." And it was enacted, that none of other de|nominations &s;hould, for the future, be allowed the privileges of di&s;&s;enters, but &s;uch as &s;hould "Be|fore the A&s;&s;embly take the oaths and &s;ub&s;cribe the
<PB N="155" REF="018336_0170_0FA5D26DE3462AA8">declaration provided in the act of Parliament, in ca&s;es of like nature." And as Mr. John Owen, of Groton, was complained of, for having in April before preached again&s;t &s;uch proceedings, an or|der was given out to bring him before the A&s;&s;em|bly, to an&s;wer therefor, at their next &s;e&s;&s;ion. In the mean time a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter came from New-Jer&s;ey, and preached at Milford; for which he was taken up on a Saturday. And as they &s;pake of confining him until Monday, he &s;aid, "Sir, I hope you will not confine me from preaching Chri&s;t." <HI>That is what we took you up for,</HI> &s;aid the Judge. He was carried, as a <HI>vagrant</HI> per&s;on, out of that Colony, but then he returned and preached at New-Haven. And as the people there had got into the way of concealing their mini&s;ters on week days, an officer came and &s;eized this mini&s;ter, at their meeting-hou&s;e door, on a Lord's day morn|ing, and carried him off. Yet when he was let go, he returned again and preached to the people, an account of which being laid before the A&s;&s;embly at New-Haven, of October 13, they added ano|ther act, which required mini&s;ters who &s;hould &s;o return to pay the co&s;t of their tran&s;portation, and to be committed until they &s;hould give an Hun|dred Pounds bond, not to offend again in like kind. Such were their proceedings again&s;t a precious mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; who&s;e name and title &s;ince is, Samuel Finley D. D. Pre&s;ident of New-Jer&s;ey college.</P>
<P N="6">VI. As Mr. Dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> avoided being taken, and like complaints were exhibited again&s;t Mr. Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roy, or|ders were ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> arre&s;t them both, and to bring them to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ion of their A&s;&s;embly. Ac|cordingly, at their meeting at Hartford, May 10, 1744. Owen came with an humble confe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="156" REF="018336_0171_0FA5D26EC186E268">and they forgave him, he paying co&s;ts. Pomroy was brought, and &s;tood trial for &s;ome hours; but was condemned, and ordered to be committed till he would pay the co&s;ts, and bind him&s;elf for one year, in a recognizance of Fifty Pounds, not to offend again in like manner. He then yielded to their requirements. And on July 28 Mr. De|venport &s;igned a retraction of the four articles which were condemned at Bo&s;ton, and of his enthu&s;ia&s;ms at New-London; which was &s;ent to Mr. Prince to publi&s;h with all &s;peed. He did &s;o, but prefixed thereto an extract from an ancient author, who &s;ays, "It is no uncommon thing for tho&s;e who love God in &s;incerity, through impatience with the bold im|pieties of wicked men, to tran&s;gre&s;s the limits of a regular zeal. And when this impatience betrays them into mi&s;takes, for which they meet with too &s;evere treatment, either from friends, or from men in power; in&s;tead of correcting only the irregular &s;allies of their zeal, they are apt to &s;uppre&s;s the mo&s;t regular and laudable expre&s;&s;ions of it, and become lukewarm and indifferent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, vol. 2, p. 234&mdash;240</NOTE>." The &s;equel will demon&s;trate the propriety of this remark.</P>
<P>IN January Elder Timothy Packom and Daniel Greene vi&s;ited their Bapti&s;t brethren at New-Lon|don and Saybrook, and baptized &s;ome per&s;ons at each place. At Saybrook the people laid &s;ome things acro&s;s a &s;tream on a Lord's day, to rai&s;e the water to baptize in. Fal&s;e charges were added to what was fact in the ca&s;e; and &s;aid two teachers, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, were &s;eized and impri&s;on|ed at New London; one of whom was a woman with a child at her brea&s;t. But the above evils were well expo&s;ed in a piece, intituled, <HI>The e&s;&s;ential rights of Prote&s;tants;</HI> dated March 30, 1744. Col. Eli&s;ha
<PB N="157" REF="018336_0172_0FA5D26F746D3BF0">Williams, the be&s;t Pre&s;ident they ever had at Yale college, was the undoubted author of it; though being printed at Bo&s;ton, it was &s;ent as a letter from thence to a friend in Connecticut. Having de|&s;cribed the origin, de&s;ign and limits of civil govern|ment, he &s;ays, "Man by his con&s;titution, as he in a rea&s;onable being, capable of the knowledge of his MAKER, is a moral and accountable being; and therefore, as every one is accountable for him&s;elf, he mu&s;t rea&s;on, judge and determine for him&s;elf. That faith and practice which depend on the judg|ment and choice of any other per&s;on, and not on the per&s;on's own judgment and choice, may pa&s;s for religion in the &s;ynagogue of Satan, who&s;e tenet is that ignorance is the mother of devotion; but with no under&s;tanding Prote&s;tant will it pa&s;s for any re|ligion at all.&mdash;Eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers, as they are Chri&s;t's officers, they have authority to teach men this have no authority to teach men any thing but the mind and will of Chri&s;t. It is a truth that &s;hines with a meridian brightne&s;s, that whatever is not contained in a commi&s;&s;ion, is out of it and ex|cluded by it; and the teaching <HI>his laws only</HI> being contained in the commi&s;&s;ion, what is not his law is out of it, and by that commi&s;&s;ion they are exclu|ed from teaching it, or forbid by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ential rights, p. 8, 17.</NOTE>." And from hence he plainly expo&s;ed their per&s;ecuting laws and mea&s;ures. But though this was printed at Bo&s;ton, and di&s;per&s;ed in Connecticut, yet the ruling party had no eyes to &s;ee it, nor ears to hear it. We mu&s;t maintain the <HI>good old way,</HI> was their cry, although what they &s;o called was diametrically oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t principles of New-England. And though for rea&s;ons before given the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts could
<PB N="158" REF="018336_0173_0FA5D2701AA61CF0">not go &s;o far as Connecticut did, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir di&s;po|&s;ition is con&s;picuous in what follows.</P>
<P>MR. Peter Thatcher was the third mini&s;ter of Middleborough, where he began to preach in Sep|tember, 1707, and he continued their pa&s;tor until his joyful exit, April 22, 1744. He was much affected with Mr. Tennent's preaching in the&s;e parts, and laboured earne&s;tly for a reformation among his people, but with much &s;orrow of heart, until &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted at a meeting, No|vember 23, 1741, that about an hundred per&s;ons, profe&s;&s;ors and others, were greatly awakened; and the en&s;uing harve&s;t was &s;o great, that when he died they had three hundred and forty-three communi|cants above half of whom were males<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tian hi&s;tory, vol. 2, p. 77&mdash;79.</NOTE> The church met &s;oon after, and elected a committee to manage their affairs, and in particular to provide preaching for them; but the pari&s;h committee, who were men of influence in the town<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jacob Thomp&s;on, Benjamin White, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Capt. Ebenezer Morton.</NOTE>, were very oppo&s;ite to the late work among them, and they counteracted the church in that matter. And when the church had voted to hear Mr. Silvanus Conant four &s;ab|bath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon probation, they went and got another man to &s;upply the pulpit the &s;ame days, the fir&s;t of which was September 9; when Conant was permit|ted to preach in the afternoon. But on September 13 they received the following advice from a Council at Duxbury, viz. "That though it belongs to the church to lead the congregation in the choice and call of a mini&s;ter to office, that it is the right, as it has been the cu&s;tom of the &s;everal pari&s;hes (when de&s;titute of a mini&s;ter) to apply, by a com|mittee cho&s;en by the whole pari&s;h, to &s;uch per&s;on
<PB N="159" REF="018336_0174_0FA5D27115CCE308">or per&s;ons as &s;hall be recommended to them for that purpo&s;e; and we advi&s;e the gentlemen, and all concerned, to follow this laudable cu&s;tom." The mini&s;ters who gave this advice were Eels of Scituate, Gay of Hingham, Lewis of Pembroke, Ba&s;s of Han|over, Perkins and Angier of Bridgewater<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morton again&s;t Cotton, p. 14, 15.</NOTE> And by the&s;e means the body of the church were &s;hut out of their meeting-hou&s;e, with the mini&s;ter they cho&s;e; and had no better place than a barn to meet in, until they built another hou&s;e. And le&s;s than a quarter of the church called them&s;elves the &s;tanding part, held the old hou&s;e, and went on and &s;ettled another mini&s;ter. Mr. Conant was ordained, according to their laws, by the advice of a Council of five churches, March 28, 1745, and mini&s;tered there to good purpo&s;e, until his decea&s;e, December 7, 1777. Mr. John Cotton, then of Halifax, now of Plymouth, publi&s;hed a narrative of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions; to which a virulent an&s;wer was returned; both in 1746. Judge Oliver was of that oppo&s;ing party; and he and others had &s;uch influence at Bo&s;ton, that the church could not have any proper hearing there for about four years. But when that was once granted, end every man in the pari&s;h had liberty to choo&s;e for him&s;elf, and each to &s;upport the mini&s;ter he cho&s;e, the oppo&s;ers were &s;oon &s;ick of their mini&s;ter, and in le&s;s than ten years he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and their &s;ociety was &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved; leaving a loud warning to all again&s;t empowering the world to controul the church about &s;oul-guides.</P>

<P N="1">1. BY whom &s;hall Jacob ari&s;e, for he is &s;mall? &s;aith one prophet. Jeru&s;alem hath none of her &s;ons to guide her, &s;aith another. And how much was this the ca&s;e with New-England in 1744? Although &s;ome of their mini&s;ters had been alive in religion, and had done a great deal to promote the power of it; yet they were agreed with formali&s;ts in confining the mini&s;try to a college education and in having of it &s;upported by tax and compul|&s;ion; therefore none of them could now lead the church out of her Egyptian bondage. And where could &s;uch a leader be found? Could any man think of looking to the barren &s;hores of Cape-Cod for his birth, to the ob&s;cure village of Canterbury for his education, or to a bench of lawyers for his
<PB N="161" REF="018336_0176_0FA5D2728B92E018">integrity and faithfulne&s;s? Of all things this &s;eem|ed mo&s;t unlikely! Yet &s;uch was the event. Mr. Eli&s;ha Paine, of Ea&s;ham, upon &s;aid Cape, removed with his family to Canterbury, and was one of the &s;even men who formed a church there, June 13, 1711. His wife was of the family of Deacon John Doane<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His daughter Abigail married a Lothrop in Norwich, where &s;he was much e&s;teemed, both for her capacity and her piety, until her death in 1735, aet. 104.</NOTE>, one of the early magi&s;trates of Plymouth Colony. Mr. Paine had four &s;ons, whom he brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The &s;econd of them dated his cover&s;ion about the time of the revival of religion at Windham in 1721, and before the general revival, twenty years after he was become one of the greate&s;t lawyers in Connecticut, and was in very pro&s;perous circum|&s;tances in the world: In one of his private papers he &s;ays, "God hath &s;o ordered it in his Providence, that ever &s;ince I was a child I have had an enquir|ing mind after knowledge, of almo&s;t all &s;orts; but religion bore the &s;way. I &s;eemed to have a regard for good men, and therefore took great care to watch per&s;ons, e&s;pecially to &s;ee how they kept the &s;abbath. Before my conver&s;ion I had the cu|rio&s;ity to hear all the different wor&s;hips in New-England, and enquired into their principles, and ob&s;erved their behaviour, both in and out of their wor&s;hip. And I &s;aw &s;o little, or rather nothing of the power of godline&s;s in any of them, that I was then even in my carnal e&s;tate, afraid that the true religion was not in this land. Yet worldly plea|&s;ure, and the form which was mo&s;t acknowledged, would &s;oon make me ea&s;y again. But when con|viction came to lay hold of me, let who would be of the true religion, I &s;aw mine was of no value." In July, 1742, he received an internal call to preach
<PB N="162" REF="018336_0177_0FA5D27323CED6F0">the go&s;pel, and in December following he offered him&s;elf for examination before &s;ome pious mini|&s;ters; and they gave him encouragement about en|tering into that work, but wore for his doing it up|on the Say brook plan, which he never liked. The church he belonged to had been de&s;titute of a pa&s;|tor near two years, when they met on January 27, 1743, and declared by vote, "That the platform of church di&s;cipline agreed upon by the Synod at Cambridge, in 164<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is mo&s;t agreeable to the form|er de&s;igned practice of this church, excepting their having ruling elders as di&s;tinct officers, and mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;criptures;" though they did not withdraw their fellow&s;hip from the con&s;ociated churches. Soon after this Mr. Paine &s;et out upon a journey; but for preaching the go&s;pel in Wood|&s;tock, which then belonged to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, he was &s;eized on February 19, by virtue of a war|rant from John Chandler, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of that town, and was impri&s;oned at Worce&s;ter.</P>
<P N="2">II. BUT his bonds proved to be for the further|ance of the go&s;pel, and he preached it to good pur|po&s;e in pri&s;on.

THIS Mr. Mo&s;ely &s;ent to him in a letter, wherein he &s;aid, "Dear Sir, &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith; be &s;trong. They that be with you are more than they that be with our adver&s;aries. Never think it hard to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t. It is enough for the &s;ervant that he be as his Lord."&mdash;Yet the next year all the&s;e men were overpowered by the enemy, &s;o as to turn and act again&s;t him, in the great cau&s;e of reformation. On May 13 Wor|ce&s;ter Court were con&s;trained to give him a di&s;|charge, as having been impri&s;oned without law; and he went round and preached the go&s;pel in the adjacent towns for a fortnight, and then returned home. July 8 he &s;et off again, and travelled to Providence, Bri&s;tol, Bo&s;ton, Cambridge, and as far northward as Dun&s;table and Lanca&s;ter, preaching the go&s;pel with great power; and returned home December 3, having, according to a journal he kept, preached two hundred and forty-four &s;er|mons in that journey. And hearing of the mea|&s;ures many were then pur&s;uing, under a pretence of promoting peace and good order, he &s;aid, "Let me &s;peak freely of the peace that Connecticut was in. For the&s;e forty years we have had the name of a contentious people in the law. This was &s;o cu&s;tomary, that to &s;ue a man for debt was become not much more than a compliment. And &s;carce a meet|ing-hou&s;e has been &s;et up for many years, without &s;undry petitions to the A&s;&s;embly; with great heats animo&s;ity, party again&s;t party, not in love, as is too well known to be denied." And yet by their laws it was Forty Pounds fine for any people to &s;et up a meeting-hou&s;e without leave from Court. And, referring to what Daniel &s;ays of tho&s;e who &s;hall be <HI>corrupted by flatteries,</HI> he &s;aid of this time, "I verily believe they know not what they are do|ing;
<PB N="164" REF="018336_0179_0FA5D2756972D700">for they &s;eem to be zealous to maintain peace, but take the direct way to break it. Chri&s;t is a peaceable Prince, and Prince of peace; and if there was nothing in the way of his kingdom, it would be as peaceable here as it is in heaven. The Spirit is compared to water; water maketh no noi&s;e unle&s;s it is interrupted; &s;o is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t." In June, 1744, he went and laboured with &s;ucce&s;s in his native country of Cape-Cod, from whence &s;prang the Bapti&s;t church in Harwich.</P>
<P N="3">III. UPON his return a divi&s;ion took place in Canterbury in the following manner. The pari&s;h had called a candidate there to preach, whom mo&s;t of the church were not edified by. In Augu&s;t a committee of their A&s;&s;ociation met there, at the call of the pari&s;h, to give advice in the ca&s;e. Mr. Paine was reque&s;ted to give them his objections again&s;t &s;aid candidate, but he refu&s;ed, becau&s;e they were not called there by the church. Another member gave them a copy of their church vote again&s;t him; which the mini&s;ters in their re&s;ult &s;aid "Was &s;igned in behalf of the <HI>aggrieved part</HI> of the church;" and advi&s;ed the pari&s;h to go on and &s;ettle their candidate. For this Paine, on September 12, wrote a &s;mart reproof to one of tho&s;e mini&s;ters, for wronging the truth, in calling that an aggrieved part, which was the church; and for encouraging the world to u&s;urp &s;uch a power over the church of Chri&s;t. Hereupon he was di&s;ciplined by the &s;ecular arm. Their charge, his plea, and their judgment thereon, were as follow. Their charge was,</P>

<P N="6">VI. FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons Mr. Paine's two nephews, John and Ebenezer Cleaveland, were expelled from college; and three years after the elde&s;t of them was &s;ettled at Ip&s;wich, and the other after|wards at Cape-Ann. Paine was repeatedly cited to appear before the mini&s;ters of that county, to an&s;wer to complaints they received again&s;t him; but he knew their way too well to be drawn into their trap. Twelve of them met November 13, and drew up a paper again&s;t him and his brethren, and publi&s;hed it in a news-paper. December 11, a larger number met, and publi&s;hed a pamphlet, as a letter from them to their &s;everal &s;ocieties, which at the foot p. 52 is &s;igned by Jo&s;eph Coite, Ebenezer Williams, Jo&s;eph Meacham, Samuel Dorrance, Solomon Williams, Jacob Eliot, Mar&s;ton Ca|bot, Samuel Mo&s;eley, Ephraim Avery, Ebenezer Devotion, Eleazer Wheelock, Abel Stiles, Ste|phen White, John Ba&s;s, Richard Salter, William Throope. A &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age therein will give a
<PB N="169" REF="018336_0184_0FA5D27E35CECBA8">plain idea of the nature of their controver&s;y. Ha|ving quoted Deut. xiii. 1-3, as a warning to the people again&s;t hearing Mr. Paine and his brethren, they &s;ay, "The ca&s;e here &s;uppo&s;ed is an attempt to draw the people to idolatry; and this you will &s;ay is not your ca&s;e. The&s;e prophets and dreamers en|deavour to draw you to Chri&s;t, and not from him: But then they endeavour to draw you from his in|&s;titutions, to a way of wor&s;hip which he has not in|&s;tituted. Though the ca&s;e is not &s;o &s;trong, yet the argument again&s;t your compliance is the &s;ame; for what&s;oever wor&s;hip God has not in&s;tituted and direct|ed in his word, is fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and therefore if there &s;eem to be never &s;o many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after, any more than after fal&s;e god.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;ociation letter, p. 43.</NOTE>." Now ob&s;erve, Chri&s;t &s;ays concerning the field, which is the world, <HI>let both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI> While he &s;ays to the church, <HI>put away from among your&s;elves that wicked per&s;on.</HI> In agreement herewith Mr. Paine applied the fir&s;t of the&s;e precepts to the <HI>State,</HI> and &s;aid, "<HI>The church</HI> is to ca&s;t her tares out, <HI>when they appear,</HI> or the whole church is leavened.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10.</NOTE>." But they contra|dicted him; and calling the field the vi&s;ible church, a&s;&s;erted that Chri&s;t would not let the &s;ervants "Go and root up the tares, even <HI>when they appeared.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 21.</NOTE>." Thus tho&s;e who u&s;e &s;ecular force in religious af|fairs, violate the divine command both ways; they ob&s;truct di&s;cipline in the church, and invade the rights of con&s;cience and humanity in the State. This was remarkably verified in Canterbury: For November 27 their church met, and &s;ixteen males again&s;t twenty-three joined with the pari&s;h in &s;end|ing for their Con&s;ociation to ordain Mr. James
<PB N="170" REF="018336_0185_0FA5D27E5C3684D8">Cog&s;well there; and the Con&s;ociation met for that purpo&s;e December 26, but not having the majority of the church for him, they could not get along ac|cording to their own laws. At length they called the pari&s;h together, and got them to declare, by vote, their willingne&s;s that the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;et off tho&s;e who did not choo&s;e him from &s;upporting him; "And that they <HI>may have</HI> all legal privileges of a di&s;tinct and religious &s;ociety;" and &s;o went on and ordained him. Which proceeding an advo|cate for them in 1771 called judicious, cautious, and gentle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fi&s;h's examiner examined, p. 76.</NOTE> Yet thereby the fir&s;t church in Can|terbury was &s;tripped of all <HI>legal privileges</HI> of a di&s;tinct religious &s;ociety; and becau&s;e they de&s;ired no new incorporation from the A&s;&s;embly, but only petition|ed to be exempted from &s;upporting a teacher they never cho&s;e, their petition was di&s;regarded, their goods were torn away, or their per&s;ons impri&s;oned therefor, for fifteen years; and the mini&s;ters who ordained him di&s;covered no more compa&s;&s;ion to|wards him, than the prie&s;t and Levite did to the man that fell among thieves. This is the plain truth, without any exaggeration.</P>
<P N="7">VII. NEW-ENGLAND now received a &s;econd vi&s;it from Mr. Whitefield, who came over in a ma&s;t-&s;hip, and landed at York, November 2. But how were mini&s;ters alarmed at the news! His fir&s;t coming cau&s;ed a great &s;haking among the dry bones; what then could they look for in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the churches? An oppo&s;ing par|ty in Plymouth, di&s;liking the preaching of the pious Mr. Leonard, had formed a new church there, and Dr. Chauncy preached at the in&s;tal|ment of their mini&s;ter, five days after Whitefield landed; when Chauncy &s;aid, "I be&s;eech my fa|thers
<PB N="171" REF="018336_0186_0FA5D27F25B84BB8">and brethren in the mini&s;try to <HI>mark this man</HI> who has cau&s;ed divi&s;ions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid him. Turn your view, my brethren, into all cor|ners of the land: Behold the confu&s;ion in towns: the contentions in churches!&mdash;Perhaps it will be &s;aid, the&s;e mi&s;chievous things are only accidental effects, and not to be charged upon him. So far from it, that they are the unavoidable con&s;equence of <HI>that &s;pirit</HI> in which he appeared<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sermon at Friends in&s;talment. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8</NOTE>." This is un|doubted truth; and the reader may judge of the nature of that &s;pirit, by the foregoing and follow|ing facts. For the heads of Harvard college &s;oon publi&s;hed a te&s;timony again&s;t Whitefield, which was followed with another, by an A&s;&s;ociation of mi|ni&s;ters at Weymouth, January 15, 1745; and a third by an A&s;&s;ociation at Marlborough, the 22d. The like was done by many other collective bodies, and by individuals. And much pains were taken to per&s;uade the world, that he was a di&s;hone&s;t man, e&s;pecially becau&s;e of his &s;aying &s;o much as he had done again&s;t unconverted mini&s;ters, while him&s;elf was a mini&s;ter of the church of England. A num|ber of an&s;wers were returned, by him&s;elf and others; &s;ome of which we have mentioned under the year 1740. On May 28; 1741, the Pre&s;ident of Har|vard college delivered a &s;ermon before the annual Convention of mini&s;ters at Bo&s;ton; when referring to Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Tennent he &s;aid, "Tho&s;e two pious and valuable men of God, who have been lately labouring more abundantly among us, have been greatly in&s;trumental in the hand of God to revive this ble&s;&s;ed work: and many, no doubt, have been &s;avingly converted from the error of
<PB N="172" REF="018336_0187_0FA5D27FE86BD6E0">their ways, and many more have been in &s;ome mea|&s;ure rou&s;ed from their lethargy." But being now reminded of this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitefield's letter to that college, p. 20, 21.</NOTE>, his reply was, "Alas, how was I deluded with &s;how and appearance!" And had he and the college now got free from delu&s;ion? In the eighth page of their te&s;timony again&s;t White-field they &s;ay, "The believer may have &s;atisfac|tion, that he hath the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God with him, in &s;o continual and regular a manner, that he may be &s;aid to dwell in him, and yet he have <HI>no feeling of it.</HI>" But ob&s;erve, to be <HI>pa&s;t feeling</HI> is the depth of Pagan darkne&s;s, Eph. iv. 19. And one of the wor&s;t things that was now alledged again&s;t Mr. Whitefield, was his &s;aying their colleges were <HI>in darkne&s;s that might be felt.</HI> Therefore it was in|geniou&s;ly a&s;ked upon this occa&s;ion, why they need to produce the evidence of their own condemna|tion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hobby's defence of Whitefield, p. 23.</NOTE>? The heads of Yale college wrote a private letter to him, and he returned an an&s;wer, with &s;eve|ral pamphlets upon the &s;ubject; but they were not &s;atisfied therewith, and therefore publi&s;hed a de|claration again&s;t him, dated February 25, 1745, wherein they &s;ay, "From the&s;e two principles which you have laid down, viz. that the generality of mini&s;ters are unconverted, and that all unconverted mini&s;ters are &s;uch baneful and pernicious men, it naturally and nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the people ought to di&s;card them, or &s;eparate from them.&mdash;If the&s;e two principles are right and true, we are &s;atis|fied your de&s;ign is good, and we would readily join with you." But being of a contrary mind, they accu&s;ed him of a de&s;ign of rooting out the &s;tand|ing mini&s;ters of the country, in order to introduce foreigners in their &s;tead, and a&s;&s;erted that he told
<PB N="173" REF="018336_0188_0FA5D280AB4116F0">Mr. Edwards a &s;tory of that nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Said declaration,</HI> p. 6&mdash;10. The taking to Cape-Breton this year was a very remarkable event. Governor Shirley fir&s;t propo&s;ed the attempt to the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton. By a very &s;mall majority they voted to undertake it, and to reque&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein from other Colonies, January 25; but the vote was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, than a general union appeared in carrying it into effect. And &s;uch di&s;patch was made, that an army con&s;i&s;ting of 4060 men, under General Pepperell, rendezvou&s;ed at Can&s;o, in April, where a &s;mall fleet met them, under the command of Sir Peter Warren. The army landed on Cape-Breton April 30, to the great &s;urprize of the enemy; and the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Loui&s;burg was giver up to them on June 17, 1745. Old Mr. Moody, who went their chaplain, publicly declared a full belief that they &s;hould take it, before the army left Bo&s;ton. Other went away &s;aying, <HI>pray for us, while we fight for you.</HI> That event was a great means of re&s;toring peace to Europe, as well as Ame|rica.</NOTE> This Ed|wards publicly contradicted; neither is there the lea&s;t evidence &s;ince of Whitefield's having any &s;uch intent. In Augu&s;t, 1745, I heard him preach at Lebanon, Windham, Norwich, Mohegin and New-London; before which I had never &s;een him. He then &s;pake again&s;t &s;eparations; and his plan evi|dently was, to labour for the conver&s;ion and edi|fication of &s;ouls, and to leave the building and government of churches to others. In 1768 the Corporation of Harvard college, with the &s;ame Pre&s;ident at their head, gave him a letter of thanks for his benefactions thereto.</P>

They held the power of ordination to be in the church; but as others have made great noi&s;e about a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive power in mini&s;ters, it is to be ob&s;erved, that Elder Deni&s;on was ordained by Elder Moulton, and he by Elder John Callender, who was ordained by Elder Eli&s;ha Callender, in who&s;e ordination three

And this line was never broken, by any act of cen&s;uring or depo&s;ing, as was the ca&s;e with di&s;&s;enters from Epi&s;copacy, and al&s;o from Popery. With my beloved mother I vi&s;ited Mr. Mar&s;h in the &s;pring, and found him comforta|ble in mind; but his body was clo&s;ely locked up in pri&s;on, while a phy&s;ician, who was put into a room over his head, for giving a &s;ingle woman a potion to de&s;troy the fruit of her womb, which de|&s;troyed her own life, was allowed, with an officer to attend him, to vi&s;it the &s;ick in various parts of the town.

IX. THE Con&s;ociation of Windham county had an account of many of the&s;e things laid before them January 13, 1747; upon which they adjourned to February 11, and &s;ent citations to the Elders Mar&s;h, the Paines, and Stevens, to return an&s;wers to ac|cu&s;ations, then received again&s;t them. In the mean time the Con&s;ociation reque&s;ted their own churches to keep a day of fa&s;ting and prayer, for divine direction. When they met again, they in&s;erted a copy of the Mansfield articles and cove|nant in their re&s;ult, with objections again&s;t many parts of it; one of which is in the&s;e words, viz. "Though mo&s;t of us agree in the article of infant bapti&s;m, yet a difference in that particular doth not break the &s;piritual communion of &s;aints; there|fore it is no ju&s;t bar to our covenanting and par|taking of the ordinances together, wherein we are agreed." This the mini&s;ters objected again&s;t, as it tended "To let in Anabapti&s;ts, and &s;eems (&s;ay they) more agreeable to the inclinations of parties than the word of God." And having in&s;erted many reports and reflections again&s;t &s;aid people, the &s;ame were publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, under the title of "The re&s;ult of a Council of the con&s;ociated churches in the county of Windham, relating to the principles and practices of the &s;everal bodies of people in &s;aid county, who have <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from the communion of the churches in this land, and &s;et up an unin&s;tituted wor&s;hip among them&s;elves containing 22 pages in octavo. All their argu|ments proceed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, without proof, that theirs were the in&s;tituted churches; and therefore that to &s;eparate from them was a revolt
<PB N="177" REF="018336_0192_0FA5D283A2FEC550">from God, and a rebellion again&s;t his government in the church. And for teaching and exhorting the prople without their leave, the before named Elder Frothingham was impori&s;oned five months, John Paine eleven months, and John Palmer from September, 1747, to January, 1748; all at Hart-ford. Solomon Paine was impri&s;oned a fortnight for that cau&s;e at Windham, be&s;ides much more of like nature done to others. And only for being members and deacons in tho&s;e &s;eparate churches, three gentlemen, at different times, were expelled out of their Legi&s;lature; namely, Capt. Obadiah John&s;on of Canterbury, Capt. Thomas Stevens of Plainfield (father to their mini&s;ter) and Capt. Nathan Jewett of Lyme. But over&s;training their power weakened it; and it now began to decline.</P>
<P N="10">X. AT the election at Hartford, May 12, 1748, Colonel Huntington was again cho&s;en into their Council, out of which he had been excluded five years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was the 5th &s;on of Deacon Chri&s;topher Huntington, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h male that was born in Norwich, after it was planted in 1660. This &s;on received an early conver&s;ion, &s;ucceeded his father in the deacon's office, and did much to promote a reforma|tion in the town, in and after 1741. Henceforward, by annual and full elections, he was continued a Coun&s;ellor, and for a num|ber of years the fir&s;t man therein; was Chief Judge of their County Court for twenty years, and a Judge of Probate, until he died in peace, February 10, 1773, aet. 76.</NOTE> And Solomon Paine came to this A&s;&s;em|bly, with a memorial, &s;igned by 330 men; pray|ing for a repeal of all their laws, which debarred any inhabitants in the Colony from the liberty granted by God and tolerated by the King, or that the ex|ecution thereof might be forbidden. After long waiting, he had liberty to read and &s;peak to the memorial in the A&s;&s;embly; and though it was then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed , yet &s;ome light was communicated there|by.
<PB N="178" REF="018336_0193_0FA5D28457028890">In December, 1748, he was pro&s;ecuted at Windham Court, for marrying a couple of his own people. His brother came and pleaded his cau&s;e. The King's Attorney, in pleading again&s;t Solomon, allowed that he was ordained the pa&s;tor of a church of Chri&s;t in Canterbury, in as &s;olemn a manner as could be; but then pleaded that he was not a civil officer, becau&s;e not cho&s;en by the majority of the pari&s;h, which was the thing which made their mini&s;ters civil officers; and he &s;aid it was in that capacity that they were &s;upported by tax, and had power to marry per&s;ons. And upon this plea the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t him; and al&s;o another ca&s;e at the &s;ame time again&s;t one of his &s;ociety, about a tax to a legal mini&s;ter. Hereupon Mr. Eli&s;ha Paine wrote an account of the&s;e pro|ceedings to other mini&s;ters, to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of their way of profe&s;&s;ing to be mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and to be &s;upported in the name of the King of England, while their con&s;titution differed e&s;&s;entially from the churches under either of tho&s;e heads. At the &s;ame time they met with a great &s;hock from another quarter.</P>
<P N="11">XI. FOR as long as Mr. Robbins continued a regular mini&s;ter, and yet was excluded out of their Con&s;ociation, it &s;erved to weaken their power. A complaint was therefore received again&s;t him, May 31, 1743, &s;igned by &s;ix of his hearers, before he had any notice of who the complainants were, or what they complained of; and a committee of mi|ni&s;ters were appointed to go to him upon it. As &s;oon as he di&s;covered who the complainants were, he went and gave them &s;atisfaction, and they wrote an account of it to &s;aid committee; yet they came to him, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his being reconciled to their Con&s;ociation: This he tried for without &s;ucce&s;s.
<PB N="179" REF="018336_0194_0FA5D28519D8A360">However, perceiving what &s;torm was gathering, he drew three confe&s;&s;ions, which he carried to another of their meetings; wherein he went as far as he could towards giving them &s;atisfaction, &s;hort of confe&s;&s;ing that he broke the law of God in preaching to tho&s;e Bati&s;ts, contrary to the de&s;ire of Pre&s;byterians. But as he could not in con&s;cience confe&s;s that, he returned home, without being reconciled to them. On May 29, 1745, a &s;econd complaint was re|ceived again&s;t him, without his having previous notice of it, and another committee was &s;ent, who prevailed with him to go and offer them a fourth confe&s;&s;ion; wherein he pleaded that his ignorance of its being a crime to preach to the Bapti&s;ts as he did, might apologize for him, &s;o that a reconcili|ation might be effected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 14.</NOTE> But they inform us, that in&s;tead of accepting what he had drawn, they drew a confe&s;&s;ion for him to this purpo&s;e, viz. "I the &s;ub&s;criber acknowledge, that I am &s;orry I preached <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> at Wallingford, and prayed at the &s;eparation at New-Haven, and promi&s;e not to do &s;o again." And only becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;ign this, without explaining the word di&s;orderly, they say, "The man appeared <HI>&s;tiff</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-willed</HI> to the la&s;t degree<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Their an&s;wer, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>." Be that as it may, he then went home, and laid the confe&s;&s;ion they had rejected before his pari&s;h, who voted it to be &s;ufficient, and de&s;ired him to continue in the mini&s;try with them, and al&s;o that no Councils nor committees might be &s;ent there again, without their reque&s;t.

<P>ROBBINS drew an&s;wers to each article, and laid them before his people, who declared their &s;atisfac|tion therewith; and his church appointed a com|mittee to lay a copy of their votes before the Coun|cil, and earne&s;tly to declare again&s;t their juri&s;diction over them.

<PB N="182" REF="018336_0197_0FA5D28B7AC29270">Pre&s;byterian and Congregational churches formed the Saybrook platform, it became their own volun|tary contract; and that being e&s;tabli&s;hed by their Legi&s;lature, it became the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of the whole Colony, as much as their charter, which united the Colonies of Hartford and New-Haven in one, was their civil con&s;titution: And that Mr. Robbins and his church had no more right to renounce their juri&s;diction, than his pari&s;h had to renounce the authority of the civil govern|ment of Connecticut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 36, 94, 112.</NOTE>: That a toleration was never intended to de&s;troy an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that as the Bapti&s;ts he preached to had not fully com|plied with the act of toleration, they were not an orderly &s;ociety, "But only a number of men that in a <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> manner refu&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their pa&s;tor." And they accu&s;e Robbins of intruding him&s;elf into the <HI>bi&s;hoprics</HI> of Mr. Whittle&s;ey, at Wallingford, and of Mr. Noyes, at New-Haven<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 6, 8, 106</NOTE> To prove which they quote the &s;ame &s;criptures that Dr. Chauncy, their champion, had cited be|fore; one of which, they &s;ay, means "In plain Engli&s;h, his doing the office of a bi&s;hop in another's dioce&s;e; and this the apo&s;tle ranks with &s;ome of the greate&s;t crimes, 1 Pet. iv. 15<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 43.</NOTE>." But who formed tho&s;e dioce&s;&s;es! Becau&s;e Robbins laid his fourth confe&s;&s;ion, which they rejected, before his pari&s;h, who voted that it was &s;ufficient, the Con|&s;ociation ob&s;erved, that a freehold rated at fifty &s;hillings, or forty pounds, in the common li&s;ts, made every inhabitant a voter in &s;uch meetings, and from thence they exclaimed again&s;t him for that procedure, &s;aying, "What if half the &s;oci|ety were &s;candalous per&s;ons<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 101.</NOTE>!" Ay, what indeed!
<PB N="183" REF="018336_0198_0FA5D28CF6BF6568">how dreadful mu&s;t the con&s;equence be! ju&s;t &s;uch as Connecticut had felt for forty years! For their laws made &s;uch votes equal to the votes of the be&s;t &s;aints among them, in the choice of their Legi&s;la|ture. And an A&s;&s;embly thus cho&s;en broke over their own law, and elected an ordained mini&s;ter for their Governor; by who&s;e influence the Saybrook &s;cheme was formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, without allow|ing the churches liberty to &s;ay whether their mini|&s;ters &s;hould meet to form it or not. And now, becau&s;e Mr. Robbins continued to preach the go&s;pel to his people, a complaint was carried to their Legi&s;lature again&s;t him, with a prayer that he might be turned out of his pulpit, &s;o that a regu|lar man might be introduced in his &s;tead.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. REFORMATION has ever been attended with great difficulties. Declen&s;ion is natu|ral to fallen men, but a return to the right way is not &s;o. When I&s;rael came out of Egypt, a mixed multitude went up. And when David withdrew from Saul's tyranny, many re&s;orted to him, not only of his kindred, but al&s;o of every one that was in di&s;tre&s;s, in debt, and that were di&s;contented; yet when it was &s;aid of his cau&s;e in general, there be many &s;ervants now-a-days that break away, every man for his ma&s;ter, the &s;cripture calls it <HI>railing,</HI> and gives the per&s;on who uttered it the character of a <HI>fool</HI> or <HI>madman.</HI> But how full is our world of &s;uch folly and madne&s;s! David became the Captain of tho&s;e who re&s;orted to him; but the people, who now came out from the above-de&s;cribed tyranny over the churches, had no &s;uch commander. Even the father who led them out had too much know|ledge, and cautious deliberation, to be long follow|ed as their chief guide; and he retired to a di&s;tant i&s;land, and &s;ettled there. Such evils had been prac|ti&s;ed under the name of learning, orthodoxy and
<PB N="185" REF="018336_0200_0FA5D015EDE04340">regularity, that many were prejudiced again&s;t the truth of what others fal&s;ly called by tho&s;e names. Chri&s;tian liberty had been &s;o much invaded, that many ran into licentiou&s;ne&s;s to avoid tyranny. The right which the go&s;pel gives to every &s;aint, freely to improve their &s;everal gifts, for mutual edifica|tion, had been &s;o much denied, that frequent in|&s;tances were now &s;een, of per&s;ons putting them|&s;elves forward in exerci&s;es which they had not a gift for; being &s;o earne&s;t to maintain the liberty of &s;peaking, as not duly to regard others right of judging. And as &s;ome precious mini&s;ters had evi|dently lo&s;t much of their former life and freedom, by their attempts to correct errors, di&s;orders and imprudences, a number of pious &s;ouls were afraid of appearing again&s;t almo&s;t any thing that wore the garb of power and life in religion. And the example of the Er&s;kines in Scotland, who came out of their national church for reformation, and yet rejected Mr. Whitefield, becau&s;e he would not come into all their mea&s;ures, was held up as a warning here, again&s;t &s;topping in what any had already attained to. And ju&s;t in this juncture a man came from Windham to Norwich, in the &s;ummer of 1746, with a proclamation of liberty, and an opening of the latter day glory; exclaim|ing again&s;t the legal bondage of praying every night and morning in families, whether per&s;ons felt a &s;pirit of prayer or not; declaring that if they had not a &s;pirit of prayer, God did not then call them to pray; and &s;o of other duties. In this way &s;undry per&s;ons, chiefly at Windham, proceeded, until they a&s;&s;erted that they had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, and were perfect and immortal; and one of them declared that he was Chri&s;t. But this &s;pirit &s;oon carried them into knavery in tem|poral
<PB N="186" REF="018336_0201_0FA5D016A1FDEF50">dealings, intemperance, and what not? About the beginning of 1748, &s;ome people in Cumberland advanced the opinion, that if a &s;aint found that he or &s;he had not been married to the per&s;on that was made for them, they were not held by legal bonds from a right now to take their true mate, if they &s;aw who it was. Hereupon an only child of a rich father, not living comfortably with her hu&s;band, ventured to reject him, and to lodge with another man. Some brethren of Artlebo|rough hearing of it, went to labour with her fa|ther, and others, to turn them from this delu&s;ion; but he &s;aid he did not believe there was any harm in it, for they lay with the bible between them. But to his &s;orrow and &s;hame his daughter proved to be with child, by her new companion, and her hu&s;band obtained a legal divorce from her. About the &s;ame time, a member of the fir&s;t church in Canterbury declared that it was revealed to him, that a certain &s;ingle woman would become his wife, though he then had a wife and children. For &s;uch conver&s;ation the church called him to an account; and, after &s;even months labour, they excommunicated him on September 27, 1749. In the winter following he purcha&s;ed &s;ome mer|cury at Norwich, and it was judged that the wo|man he had a fancy for poi&s;oned two children, they giving out that a new and &s;trange di&s;temper was come among them, and then poi&s;oned his wife, &s;o that all the three died. This was not doubted to be the fact, though &s;he was acquitted upon trial in Court, and he married her, and afterwards went into the war, and died in Canada. Some of her relations were called to an account, and were ca&s;t out of the church in Canterbury, for perjury, when acting as witne&s;&s;es in Court upon that ca&s;e.</P>

II. Now though no actors in the two fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;cenes of iniquity were ever members of any of tho&s;e Separate churches, and &s;aid church had &s;o clearly acquitted them&s;elves of the third, yet mini&s;ters, even from their pulpits, through the whole country, ca&s;t the&s;e &s;candals upon the Separate cau&s;e in general, to prove the dreadful danger and effects of &s;eparating from them; and the populace were very ready to follow their guides, in this way of &s;lander and railing. Such glaring inju&s;tice to their character, added to much violence upon their per&s;ons and e&s;tates, &s;erved greatly to confirm them in their way; and to guard their minds again&s;t receiving any in&s;truction or correc|tion from men who treated them &s;o abu&s;ively. A fir&s;t principle of their &s;eparation was, that the lead|ings of the divine &s;pirit are ever to be followed, and not fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, nor man's inventions; but how little was the meaning and right application of this principle under&s;tood? When it was a&s;&s;ert|ed, that none but the regenerate ought to be ad|mitted to full communion, mini&s;ters would an|&s;wer, that you cannot know who they are. And when it was mentioned, that our Lord &s;ays, <HI>ye &s;hall know them by their fruits;</HI> the que&s;tion was &s;hifted, whether they held to a &s;atisfactory or an infalli|ble knowledge? which di&s;pute was often carried to extremes on both &s;ides. And as many would confine the word fruits to dry morality, others ran to the oppo&s;ite extreme, and formed their judg|ments of per&s;ons by their inward feelings towards them, rather than upon an intelligible view of what came from them by words and actions. The evils al&s;o which many had &s;uffered from an over|bearing majority, turned &s;ome to plead again&s;t re|ceiving any members till every individual had fel|low&s;hip
<PB N="188" REF="018336_0203_0FA5D018A6331550">with them, and the like in other church acts. At length they found that hereby the lea&s;t member might tyrannize over the whole church. Again, though the undue power of Councils had been much complained of, yet the Separates run into that evil in a new way. When Councils were called, they were received into fellow&s;hip with the church that wanted advice; and when they had heard the ca&s;e, and given their advice, in many in&s;tances the Council acted with the church in cen|&s;uring delinquents; though &s;ometimes there were more of the Council than of the acting members of the church. After &s;ome years this practice was dropt. Other mi&s;takes will appear in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="3">III. HAVING good men again&s;t them in the cau&s;e of reformation was matter of peculiar trial. It was as much &s;o with regard to Mr. Edwards, as any one man. His &s;ucce&s;s was very great, and by acting upon Mr. Stoddard's doctrine, the church in Northampton was become very numerous; into which he e&s;&s;ayed to bring go&s;pel di&s;cipline, in 1744. But when &s;ome of their chief families per|ceived that it would expo&s;e their own conduct, they were inflamed again&s;t Mr. Edwards. And though it could not be honorable to reject &s;uch an eminent mini&s;ter on that account; yet finding that he had turned from good old Mr. Stoddard's doctrine, that change was eagerly taken hold of, as a cover for their re&s;entment. And all his prudent endea|vours could never bring that church, as a body, to give him a fair hearing of his rea&s;ons for altering his &s;entiments upon that point: They were there|fore publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton this year. Some of his cleare&s;t proofs again&s;t admitting un&s;anctified per|&s;ons to the ordinance of the &s;upper, are Rom. ii.
<PB N="189" REF="018336_0204_0FA5D018E025FEE8">29, vi. 1&mdash;4. Phil. iii. 3, Col. ii. 11, 12. From whence he &s;ays, "<HI>That bapti&s;m,</HI> by which the pri|mitive converts were <HI>admitted</HI> into the church, was u&s;ed as an exhibition and token of their being vi&s;ibly <HI>regenerated,</HI> dead to &s;in, and alive to God. The &s;aint&s;hip, godline&s;s and holine&s;s, of which, according to &s;cripture, profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians and vi&s;ible &s;aints do make a profe&s;&s;ion and have a vi&s;i|bility, is not any religion and virtue that is the re|&s;ult of common grace, or moral &s;incerity (as it is called) but <HI>&s;aving grace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On a right to &s;acraments, p. 20&mdash;23.</NOTE>." Which point was the capital article that the Separate churches were built upon; but for fear it &s;hould be improved in their favour, he reminded the reader of what he had &s;aid again&s;t them, in his treati&s;e on the affections, and in Brainard's life; and then &s;aid, "I am &s;till of the &s;ame mind concerning their lay-ordinations, their lay-preachings, and public exhortings, and admini|&s;tering &s;acraments; their a&s;&s;uming, &s;elf-confident, contentious, uncharitable, &s;eparating &s;pirit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preface, p. 5.</NOTE>." And yet he lived remote from almo&s;t all the numerous communities whom he thus cen&s;ured, and knew but very little of the real &s;tate of their controver&s;y. The excellent rules which he had publi&s;hed &s;even years before, were then out of his mind; namely, to judge of a work by the real nature of it, and not by the circum&s;tances and means of its introduction; to make the &s;criptures the whole rule to judge by; and well to di&s;tingui&s;h between the good and the bad among the &s;ubjects of the work<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Thoughts on the work, 1742, p. 1&mdash;40.</NOTE> A due re|gard to the&s;e rules of his own would have pre|vented the above reflections, as well as many things in the two other books named. A Separate mini|&s;ter, in the ea&s;t part of Connecticut, wrote to Mr.
<PB N="190" REF="018336_0205_0FA5D019AAB866C0">Edwards upon this &s;ubject, and in particular de&s;ir|ed him to an&s;wer two que&s;tions.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As he had de&s;cribed an excellent new hou&s;e, how we could get into it without going out of the old one, which was in a ruined condition?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What he meant by the word <HI>lay,</HI> which he &s;o often u&s;ed; whether the &s;ame as the <HI>Latin</HI> church did?</ITEM>
</LIST>
He returned an an&s;wer, wherein he allowed the old hou&s;e to be in a ruinous condition; but thought we were not yet called to leave it. And to explain what he meant by laymen, he had recour&s;e to the old opinion about a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive power in mini&s;ters; but he &s;oon after felt &s;uch effects of that power, as he hardly could have believed before.</P>
<P>FOR his people were &s;o unea&s;y, that he agreed to call a mutual Council of ten churches, to &s;ettle the controver&s;y betwixt them: But in the large county of Hamp&s;hire, which then included Berk&s;hire al&s;o, he could find but three mini&s;ters of his judgment, upon the point in di&s;pute; and the church was &s;trenuous again&s;t allowing him liberty to go out of that county for the other two whom he was to choo&s;e. At length they yielded &s;o far; but when the Council met, one of the churches had refu&s;ed to &s;end to it; &s;o that though their mini&s;ter was re|ceived to act in the Council, yet he had no delegate with him; therefore Mr. Edwards was <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from his dear flock, by the major vote of only one delegate in that Council. And the only charge that they had again&s;t him they &s;tated in the&s;e words, viz. "The pa&s;tor in&s;i&s;ting upon it as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the admi&s;&s;ion of members to full com|munion, that they &s;hould make a profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;anctifying grace;</HI> whereas the brethren are of the opinion, that the Lord's &s;upper is a converting or|dinance, and con&s;equently that per&s;ons, if they have
<PB N="191" REF="018336_0206_0FA5D01A5D6FDF98">a competency of knowledge, and are of a blamele&s;s life, may be admitted to the Lord's table, although they make <HI>no &s;uch profe&s;&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Re&s;ult of the Council at Northampton, June 22, 1750, p. 3, 4. And Edwards's life.</NOTE>." And Dr. Solomon Williams, who wrote again&s;t him, &s;ays, "Nothing &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed in the words of the profe&s;&s;ion, but what &s;ome <HI>un&s;anctified men</HI> may &s;ay and &s;peak true<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Edwards, p. 47.</NOTE>." And he was a chief actor in all that the mini&s;ters of Windham county had done again&s;t the Separates. And Mr. Edwards, who had been moved to cen&s;ure them &s;o hardly, yet was now <HI>&s;eparated</HI> from the people he dearly loved, upon the &s;ame point; and he removed and &s;ettled at Stockbridge, where he became more exten&s;ively &s;erviceable to mankind; e&s;pecially by his incom|parable treati&s;e upon the liberty of the will, and his an&s;wer to Taylor on original &s;in, both of which have been reprinted in London. At la&s;t he was cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of New-Jer&s;ey college; but &s;oon died there of the &s;mall-pox, March 22, 1758, aet. 56.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE fundamental principle above de&s;crib|ed, naturally leads to the exclu&s;ion of infant &s;prink|ling; but the generality of tho&s;e who came out in &s;eparation had no &s;uch idea. The Mansfield ar|ticles held up internal union as the rule of church communion, although per&s;ons were of different &s;en|timents about bapti&s;m; but there were very few Bapti&s;ts in any of their churches before 1749. In June that year Elder Moulton baptized thirteen members of the Separate church in Sturbridge, one of whom was Deacon Daniel Fi&s;k; and in a little time after all their officers, and the main body of the church, were baptized, even above three&s;core per&s;ons. The exempting law for Bapti&s;ts had again
<PB N="192" REF="018336_0207_0FA5D01BD992FB58">expired in 1747, when it was revived and con|tinued for ten years. And in order that the bene|fit of it might be extended to that &s;ociety, two principal members of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton wrote a certificate in their favour to Stur|bridge a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, Jan. 23, 1750. And in May fol|lowing two principal members of the Bapti&s;t church in Sturbridge gave in a li&s;t of their &s;ociety accord|ing to law; yet they were all again taxed to Mr. Caleb Rice, a mini&s;ter in that town. And, only for this and the following year, five men were im|pri&s;oned at Worce&s;ter, three oxen and eight cows were taken away, and a great deal of other property, for &s;uch taxes. Aaron Allen was the collector who did it for 1750, and Jonathan Ma&s;on for 175<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The fir&s;t took a good cow from David Mor&s;e, a ruling elder in &s;aid Bapti&s;t church, for a tax of One Pound One Shilling and Fourpence; and the other took a pair of oxen from him, valued at Eleven Pounds, for a tax of le&s;s than Five Dollars. Such havoc did they make of their neighbours goods, under religious pretences! Sundry pro&s;e|cutions were commenced again&s;t tho&s;e collectors; and when one of the ca&s;es came to the Superior Court, both parties agreed to refer it to the judges; and they gave judgment in favour of the Bap|ti&s;ts. This gave a &s;hock to their oppre&s;&s;ors; but a &s;cheme was &s;oon contrived to non&s;uit the other actions commenced; and that was by pleading, that the &s;uit &s;hould have been again&s;t the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and not the collectors. By this trick Mr. Mor&s;e was injured to the value of above Twenty Pounds; and the whole &s;ociety e&s;timated their damages at more than a Hundred Pounds. And in a warrant for their town-meeting of March 2, 1752, an ar|ticle was in&s;erted, to &s;ee if the town would in|demnify
<PB N="193" REF="018336_0208_0FA5D01C0012F778">their collector for his expences, in the action which was turned again&s;t him. Mo&s;es Mar|cy, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was Moderator, and as this article was objected to, it was propo&s;ed to rai&s;e the money by &s;ub&s;cription, and they enquired how much it was. Upon which the Moderator drew out and read a paper, containing an account of "So much for go|ing to a lawyer, and &s;o many dollars given to Col. Brattle at one time, and &s;o many to another man," &amp;c. and he &s;aid the whole, with the execution, amounted to above Twenty Pounds. This moved the people &s;o, that it did not &s;eem likely that they would vote it by it&s;elf; therefore, contrary to law, (which was in&s;i&s;ted upon by the Bapti&s;ts pre&s;ent) that article was blended with another about &s;chool-money, and the vote was carried, whereby the Bap|ti&s;ts were again taxed to pay the expences of an ille|gal law-&s;uit again&s;t them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e facts about &s;aid meeting were &s;worn to by three men at Worce&s;ter, Augu&s;t 31, 1753, one of whom was Deacon Daniel Fi&s;k, who died a member of our Legi&s;lature in 1778</NOTE> And this was not enough; but &s;aid Moderator, who was a mem|ber of the Legi&s;lature, moved them &s;o with the&s;e things, that when they met November 22, 1752, they broke in upon their own law, and enacted, that the mini&s;ter, with two principal members of the Bapti&s;t church, &s;hould &s;ign their certificates for the future; and al&s;o that no mini&s;ter or church &s;hould have any power to give lawful certificates, until they &s;hall have obtained "From three other churches, commonly called Anabapti&s;ts, in this or the neighbouring Provinces, a certificate from each re&s;pectively, that they e&s;teem &s;uch church to be of their denomination, and that they con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe them to be Anabapti&s;ts." All &s;uch certifi|cates to be lodged with the town-clerk where
<PB N="194" REF="018336_0209_0FA5D01CEE58F5B0">the Bapti&s;ts lived, before their &s;everal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were made. This act to continue in force five years. And &s;aid Moderator pre&s;ented a petition to the A&s;&s;embly in June following, that all the unim|proved lands in Sturbridge might be taxed to his mini&s;ter; but did not obtain it. It is be ob|&s;erved, that tho&s;e who lately became Bapti&s;ts were not in fellow&s;hip with mo&s;t of the old Bapti&s;t churches; therefore this act was pa&s;&s;ed to prevent their being exempted from taxes to State wor&s;hip. It al&s;o required them to certify a con&s;cientious be|lief of a point which they never did believe, viz. That they were Anabapti&s;ts <HI>(rebaptizers)</HI> a name of reproach ca&s;t upon them by their per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P N="5">V. AND among the many in&s;tances that di&s;co|vered how tenacious our oppre&s;&s;ors were of their taxing power to &s;upport wor&s;hip, take the follow|ing, E&s;ther White, of Raynham, had a &s;mall in|tere&s;t left her, for which &s;he was taxed <HI>Eightpence</HI> to the pari&s;h mini&s;ter, from whom &s;he had with|drawn four years; and &s;he &s;eriou&s;ly declared that it was again&s;t her con&s;cience to pay it. Therefore, for no more than that &s;um, &s;he was &s;eized on Fe|bruary 28, 1752, and was impri&s;oned at Taunton until March, 1753, when &s;aid mini&s;ter's own people were con&s;trained to go and relea&s;e her, without her paying any acknowledgment to that taxing power. She &s;oon after became a Bapti&s;t, and continued to give abiding evidence of true piety, until &s;he died in peace in 1774. The ca&s;e of Framingham, twenty-five miles we&s;tward of Bo&s;ton, affords a further demon&s;tration of the iniquity of &s;upporting mini&s;ters by tax and compul&s;ion. The Honor|able Edward Goddard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> formerly one of the Council in this Province, with other fathers of that town, could not concur with the majority in the
<PB N="195" REF="018336_0210_0FA5D01D8CB49FE0">&s;ettlement of a mini&s;ter; and by the advice of other mini&s;ters they became an organized church by them&s;elves in 1747, and wanted nothing but the &s;anction of the civil power, to make them as regu|lar and orthodox a &s;ociety in law as any others were. But as they were zealous friends to the late revival of religion, &s;uch an incorporation was de|nied them. And they had been all taxed to a mini&s;ter they never cho&s;e, for &s;ix years before the publication upon the &s;ubject, which is quoted in the appendix to vol. 1, p. 8, 15. Three years after their mini&s;ter left them, and a Bapti&s;t &s;ociety is now formed among them. And Connecticut &s;till kept pace with the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in oppre&s;&s;ion, of which the place of the author's nativity now exhi|bited a &s;triking example. A widow who had with|drawn from their wor&s;hip &s;even years, and &s;teadily attended and &s;upported wor&s;hip in another church, gives &s;o clear an account of it, that her letter is here pre&s;ented to the reader, without adding or dimi|ni&s;hing a word.</P>

<P>I HAVE heard &s;omething of the trials among&s;t you of late, and I was grieved, till I had &s;trength to give up the ca&s;e to God, and leave my burthen there. And now I would tell you &s;omething of our trials. Your brother Samuel lay in pri&s;on twenty days. October 15 the collectors came to our hou&s;e, and took me away to pri&s;on about nine o'clock, in a dark rainy night. Brothers Hill and Sabin were brought there the next night! We lay in pri&s;on thirteen days, and then &s;et at liberty, by what means
<PB N="196" REF="018336_0211_0FA5D020E40C9F58">I know not. Whil&s;t I was there a great many people came to &s;ee me; and &s;ome &s;aid one thing and &s;ome another. O the innumerable &s;nares and temptations that be&s;et me, more than I ever thought on before! But, O the conde&s;cen&s;ion of heaven! though I was bound when I was ca&s;t into this furnace, yet was I loo&s;ed, and found Je&s;us in the mid&s;t of the furnace with me. O then I could give up my name, e&s;tate, family, life and breath, freely to God. Now the pri&s;on looked like a palace to me. I could ble&s;s God for all the laughs and &s;coffs made at me. O the love that flowed out to all mankind! Then I could forgive as I would de&s;ire to be forgiven, and love my neighbour as my&s;elf. Deacon Gri&s;wold was put into pri&s;on the 8th of October, and ye&s;terday old brother Grover, and are in pur&s;uit of others; all which calls for humiliation. This church hath appointed the 13th of November to be &s;pent in prayer and fa&s;ting on that account.

<P>SOME time after her brother, Mr. I&s;aac Tracy, was impri&s;oned for the &s;ame cau&s;e, while he was a member of their Legi&s;lature; and they furiou&s;ly went on, in impri&s;oning of per&s;ons and &s;poiling of goods, to &s;upport State wor&s;hip, for eight years, till the &s;piritual weapons of truth and love van|qui&s;hed tho&s;e carnal weapons; and they have not been &s;o u&s;ed in Norwich for the&s;e many years pa&s;t. And as great a victory was al&s;o gained in Canter|bury. The fall after Mr. Eli&s;ha Paine was &s;et|tled on Long-I&s;land, he came over to Canterbury for &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries for his family, when Samuel

O! that men could &s;ee how far this is from Chri&s;t's rule! That all things that we would have others do un|to us, that we &s;hould do even &s;o unto them. I believe the &s;ame people that put this authority into the hands of Mr. Cog&s;well, their mini&s;ter, to put me into pri&s;on for not paying him for preaching, would think it very hard for the church I belong to, and am pa&s;tor of, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould get the upper hand, and tax and impri&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, for not paying what he &s;hould be &s;o unju&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">xed at; and yet I can &s;ee no other difference, only becau&s;e the pow|er is in his hands: For I &s;uppo&s;e he has heard me as often as I ever have him; yet he hath taken by force from me two cows and one &s;teer, and now my body held in pri&s;on, only becau&s;e the power is in his hands." And on December 11 he wrote to Canterbury a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and &s;aid, "To you, gen|tlemen, practitioners of the law, from your pri&s;on|er in Windham gaol, becau&s;e his con&s;cience will not let him pay to a mini&s;ter that is &s;et up by the law of Connecticut, contrary to his con&s;cience and con&s;ent. The Roman Emperor was called Pon|tifix Maximus, becau&s;e he pre&s;ided over civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; which is the fir&s;t bea&s;t who per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians that &s;eparated from their e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, which they called the holy re|ligion of their forefathers; and by their law fined, whipt, impri&s;oned, and killed &s;uch as refu&s;ed obe|dience thereto.

FIVE days after he was relea&s;ed; but the extremity of the winter hindered him a great while from getting over to his family, who &s;uffered much in an unfini&s;hed hou&s;e, for want of his help. Mr. Solomon Paine publi&s;hed this year a view of the difference between the church of Chri&s;t, and the churches e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in Connecticut. And though the conte&s;t was hot for eight years longer, yet it then abated, and in 1771 Mr. Cog&s;well was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and &s;uch taxes were entirely dropt in the place, and a number of actors therein were brought to confe&s;s their faults for the &s;ame. In the mean time, another un&s;ucce&s;sful addre&s;s to their A&s;&s;embly, &s;igned by a large number of men, was pre&s;ented in 1753. After which twenty churches joined in a memorial to the King in Coun|cil,

But having laid it before the deputation and commit|tee for the Di&s;&s;enters, whereof Dr. Avery was Chairman, they judged that if tho&s;e plain viola|tions of charter rights were pre&s;ented to the King in Council, it would endanger the taking away of Connecticut charter; which the petitioners were by no means willing for. Therefore &s;aid Agents returned in 1757; and &s;aid committee wrote to Connecticut rulers again&s;t tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions. And by their advice a proce&s;s in executive Courts was commenced, with a de&s;ign of carrying it to England by way of appeal; but having proceeded &s;ome ways therein, they dropt it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. TIMOTHY PACKOM was an aged and pious member of the &s;econd church in Newport, before a divi&s;ion took place therein, in the following manner. Daniel Greene, a gifted member of it, experienced a &s;udden turn in his mind, from general to particular redemption: And in the fall of 1739 James Brown joined with him, and brought a charge, in general terms, into their church again&s;t Elder Eyres, of his wanting the go&s;pel qualifications of an elder; and then named &s;ome in&s;tances of ap|parent anger and &s;everity again&s;t members who did not concur with his mea&s;ures, to prove it. This cau&s;ed much unhappine&s;s: At length on January 10, 1740, he read to the church a general confe&s;|&s;ion of his imperfections in tho&s;e re&s;pects; and they voted the &s;ame to be &s;atisfactory. Said brethren
<PB N="201" REF="018336_0216_0FA5D024E45427D8">enquired whether he meant to confe&s;s the particu|lars they had mentioned, but could obtain no an|&s;wer from him, nor a copy of his confe&s;&s;ion. This appeared &s;o grievous that they went and complain|ed of it to their brethren of North-King&s;town, who &s;ent to enquire into the matter. For the&s;e things Greene and Brown were cen&s;ured; and Packom and others joined with them, and carried their com|plaints to one general meeting of their churches at Swanzey, and to another at Providence; and not obtaining &s;atisfaction, they formed a new church, and got &s;ome of their elders to ordain Mr. Packom as pa&s;tor of it. And in 1742 they publi&s;hed a vin|dication of them&s;elves in the&s;e proceedings. But private letters afterwards from each of tho&s;e men, to Elder Eyres and his church, expre&s;s deep &s;orrow for tho&s;e ha&s;ty proceedings, and their want of a fruitful under&s;tanding, humility and candour, with their zeal therein; for which they earne&s;tly de&s;ired for|givene&s;s. But not &s;eeing their way clear to return into full fellow&s;hip with that church, a removal of their cen&s;ure was denied them. Greene, in a let|ter July 2, 1745, gives the following as the chief rea|&s;on why he could not commune with &s;aid elder, viz. "So far as I can gather, thou believe&s;t, that man's &s;alvation, conditionally be&s;towable, is the free pur|cha&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o the free gift of God: But then that the &s;ecurity of the be&s;towment, or ob|taining this &s;alvation, doth turn and depend upon a condition, which is &s;o left to man to perform, that it may or may not be performed; not as God him&s;elf &s;hall be plea&s;ed ab&s;olutely to cau&s;e, but as man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;elf-inclining agent, &s;hall of him|&s;elf be di&s;po&s;ed, in the improvement or mi&s;im|provement of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Whereas I be|lieve,
<PB N="202" REF="018336_0217_0FA5D0259EE600F0">I think, with all my heart, that man is in no re&s;pect an independent agent; and that if he obtains &s;alvation, it is not owing to him&s;elf at all; but that his &s;alvation, and its whole &s;ecurity to him, depend altogether upon the free plea&s;ure and cau&s;ation of Almighty God, who worketh all things according to the council of his own will, working in his chil|dren both to will and to do of his own good plea|&s;ure." Such ideas, but not &s;o clear, were impre&s;&s;|ed upon David Sprague's mind, before he began to preach, in the Bapti&s;t church in Scituate; where he was told, that if he went on in that way he would be|come as bad an <HI>electioner</HI> as any of the Pre&s;byterians. This, as he informed me, turned him in a great mea|&s;ure into their general way of preaching; and he was &s;ettled in that way, at North-King&s;town, about the time of the above&s;aid divi&s;ion at Newport.</P>
<P N="2">II. BY the labours of Separate mini&s;ters many were converted, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Coventry, and a pa&s;tor was ordained in it Octo|ber 11, 1749. Elder Sprague went there, and was prevailed with to a&s;&s;i&s;t, with other Bapti&s;ts, in that ordination. And he there got &s;uch an acquaint|ance with &s;ome Separate elders, as to invite them to come and preach in the Narragan&s;ent country. This was done with very exten&s;ive effects; and Sprague was drawn &s;o far as to act with Solomon Paine in Elder Babcock's ordination the next &s;pring; which was then the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the union of the two denominations in &s;uch acts. The majority of the church at North-King&s;town grew &s;o unea&s;y, that above &s;eventy of them, male and female, &s;igned a paper May 20, 1750, which divided the church. They therein repre&s;ent, that their church was of about forty years &s;tanding, and that good order had gene|rally
<PB N="203" REF="018336_0218_0FA5D0269BA4D3F8">been kept up in it, until within the la&s;t &s;even years. "Since that, &s;ay they, our elder and &s;ome of the brethren have imbibed doctrines which neither we nor our general community ever did choo&s;e &s;hould be brought into the church. The doctrines crouded upon us were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Adam, by his eating the forbidden fruit, did bring mankind under con|demnation in re&s;pect to the life which is to come at the day of judgment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That every per&s;on who is truly converted, cannot, in the cour&s;e of his life, &s;in him&s;elf out of God's ble&s;&s;ings at the day of judg|ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it was a duty for Chri&s;tians to &s;ing, with loud and joined voices, with rhyme and tunes of man's compo&s;ure, in public a&s;&s;emblies."</ITEM>
</LIST>
The&s;e doctrines and their effects were then &s;hut out of their meeting-hou&s;e; though they propo&s;ed to leave it to others to &s;ettle the matter with their di&s;&s;ent|ing brethren about their intere&s;t therein. Upon which Elder Sprague, and tho&s;e who were of his &s;entiments, con&s;tituted a church in Exeter, and &s;everal other churches were &s;oon after formed in tho&s;e parts, in fellow&s;hip with them.</P>
<P N="3">III. SOME among them, who had been bap|tized in the time of their former darkne&s;s, were now baptized again; which moved Elder Eyres to write to Elder Sprague about it, December 1, 1750, and a &s;top was put thereto. Al&s;o a &s;ight of former divi&s;ions, upon circum&s;tantials, carried a few &s;o far into the oppo&s;ite extreme, as to admit &s;ome to table communion without any water bap|ti&s;m at all. There were at lea&s;t two in&s;tances of this, the one at Exeter, the other at Warwick; but that practice was &s;oon over. And the&s;e and other mi&s;takes could not hinder an exten&s;ive &s;pread of believers bapti&s;m among the Separate churches;
<PB N="204" REF="018336_0219_0FA5D02726702238">who&s;e elders, Mack of Lyme, Stearns of Tolland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elder Shubael Stearns (having baptized Noah Alden, in July, 1754, and left him to preach to the part of his &s;ociety who remained there) &s;et off with others for North-Carolina; and he, Jonathan Polk, Daniel Mar&s;hal, and others, were in|&s;trumental of a great work in tho&s;e parts. I am well informed that from thence have &s;prung a large number of Bapti&s;t churches; which, by a ble&s;&s;ing upon the &s;ucceeding labours of many, now extend through various parts of Virginia, North and South-Carolina, and into Georgia.</NOTE>, Ha&s;tings of Suffield, Meacham of Enfield, Mar|&s;hal of Somers, and others, were baptized. But fierce oppo&s;ition being rai&s;ed again&s;t what was called <HI>rebaptizing,</HI> which was repre&s;ented to be a mo&s;t wicked and pernicious thing, &s;everal teachers and others retracted their acting therein. And as the author's refu&s;ing to follow their example brought him to be a public object of re&s;entment, and &s;uc|ceeding events have made him more exten&s;ively &s;o, a clear idea of this part of our hi&s;tory cannot be given, without a more di&s;tinct account of his per|&s;onal conduct, and the motives thereof, than other|wi&s;e would have been expedient and becoming. This he thinks is confirmed by ancient examples. Acts xi. 2&mdash;18, xxii. 3&mdash;21.</P>
<P N="4">IV. HIS being born of religious parents, and having a religious (though not what is called a liberal) education, he has ever e&s;teemed an un|&s;peakable favour. Yet he neglected the great &s;al|vation for more than &s;eventeen years, becau&s;e he &s;ecretly imagined that it would abridge his pre|&s;ent liberty and comfort; and al&s;o, that when he got ready to &s;et about the work in good earne&s;t, God would be moved to help, pardon and &s;ave him. But in May, 1741, his eyes were opened to &s;ee, that time was not at his command, and
<PB N="205" REF="018336_0220_0FA5D02AB0D61EF8">that eternity was directly before him, into which he might ju&s;tly be called the next moment. Then he knew what it was to work for his life for three months; until on Augu&s;t 24, as he was alone in the field, it was demon&s;trated to his mind and con&s;cience, that he had done his utmo&s;t to make him&s;elf better, without obtaining any &s;uch thing; but that he was a guilty &s;inner in the hands of a holy God, who had a right to do with him as &s;eem|ed good in God's &s;ight; which he then yielded to, and all his objections again&s;t it were &s;ilenced. And &s;oon upon this a way of relief was opened to his &s;oul, which he never had any true idea of before, wherein truth and ju&s;tice &s;hine with lu&s;tre, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;towment of free mercy and &s;alvation upon ob|jects who have nothing in them&s;elves but badne&s;s. And while this divine glory engaged all his atten|tion, his burthen of guilt and evil di&s;po&s;itions was gone, and &s;uch ideas and inclinations were im|planted in his heart as were never there before, but which have never been rooted out &s;ince, though often over-clouded. Hereupon he was led to make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, in the church where he had always attended wor&s;hip, and to walk therein for about two years. But then their mini&s;ter obtained a vote in the church, to empower him to admit communicants by a major vote, without giving the church &s;o much as a written relation of any in|ward change. It al&s;o appeared that the mini&s;ter inclined to think that the ordinance of the &s;upper was a converting ordinance; and he di&s;covered a &s;trong affection for the Saybrook &s;cheme, which the church had rejected ju&s;t before they &s;ettled him. The author therefore withdrew from that church, about the time that Canterbury church was robbed of their rights, in the manner before
<PB N="206" REF="018336_0221_0FA5D02C29E0E6C8">de&s;cribed. He had no expectation of entering into the work of the mini&s;try, until September, 1746; and the grounds he acted upon then are de&s;cribed in his di&s;cour&s;e, publi&s;hed eight years after, entituled, <HI>The nature and nece&s;&s;ity of an in|ternal call to preach the go&s;pel.</HI> The manner of his &s;ettling among the people he &s;till mini&s;ters to, here follows.</P>
<P N="5">V. IN a place called Titicut, upon the river be|tween Bridgwater and Middleborough, a powerful work was wrought, in and after the year 1741, chief|ly by means of the preaching of Mr. Elieb Byram; which moved the people to petition for a new pre|cinct, in order to &s;ettle him as their mini&s;ter: But the matter was delayed until he was gone and &s;et|tled in New-Jer&s;ey. And after Titicut precinct was con&s;tituted, in February, 1743, mini&s;ters refu&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s the communicants therein, &s;o as to form a new church, le&s;t they &s;hould call a mini&s;ter whom they did not approve of. They were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hus denied the rights which both the laws of God and man al|lowed them, until the brethren determined not to be re&s;trained by &s;uch tyranny any longer; but came out and began to wor&s;hip by them&s;elves on Decem|ber 13, 1747. The author was then unknown to them, and they to him; but by the di&s;po&s;al of Pro|vidence he was brought among them the next Sa|turday, in company with Mr. Snow, of Providence, who &s;tayed and laboured ten days with remarkable effects; and the author was prevailed with to tarry and preach among them. And the precinct com|mittee, perceiving that open oppo&s;ition would then be in vain, came and reque&s;ted him to preach to them, and to take regular &s;teps for &s;ettlement. He informed them, that he was willing to act regularly according to the go&s;gel, but could not &s;ubmit to
<PB N="207" REF="018336_0222_0FA5D02DF4815478">the power that mini&s;ters and pari&s;hes had a&s;&s;umed over the churches, which was contrary thereto. Yet they reque&s;ted him, and he con&s;ented, to preach to them for a while. Such a revival took place as pro|duced the hopeful conver&s;ion of about twenty &s;ouls, and the quickening of many others. A church was formed February 16, 1748, which increa&s;ed to three&s;core members in ten months. But the op|po&s;ite party met in March, and voted a large &s;um of money to fini&s;h their meeting-hou&s;e, and to hire other &s;ort of preaching, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it upon all the inhabitants. Therefore our &s;ociety, on November 21, drew an addre&s;s to them, to remind them of pa&s;t tran&s;actions, and to invite them into a reconci|liation; or, if not, yet to intreat them not to violate the golden rule in their dealings towards us. They returned an an&s;wer which &s;ays, "What we demand of you is equal and right; what you demand of us is evil and &s;inful; and hence we have the golden rule upon our &s;ide, while you are receding and depart|ing from it." And they went &s;o far as to call it "Gro&s;s ignorance and enthu&s;ia&s;m" for any to deny that Chri&s;tian rulers have a right to compel their &s;ubjects to receive and &s;upport orthodox mini&s;ters. And February 6, 1749, the author was &s;eized as a pri&s;oner, for Thirteen Shillings and Fourpence a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed upon him in &s;aid tax. But as he refu&s;ed to pay it, they after about three hours confinement &s;et|tled it among them&s;elves. This was the be&s;t reward they ever offered him for preaching two months at their reque&s;t. One of his brethren was impri&s;on|ed at Plymouth for &s;aid tax. But when di&s;tre&s;s was made upon another of his hearers, they were pro&s;e|cuted therefor, and it was found upon trial that &s;aid money was voted at an illegal meeting. They therefore appealed to the Superior Court; and in the
<PB N="208" REF="018336_0223_0FA5D02EA2C3DB48">mean time, on December 14, 1749, procured an act of the Legi&s;lature which &s;ays, "That the proceed|ings of the meeting mentioned in the petition he and they hereby are held and deemed good and valid in law, the defect of the notification for call|ing &s;aid meeting notwith&s;tanding." And by virtue of this act the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t the appellee in the next trial; which &s;hews that a wor&s;hip &s;upport|ed by tax, is <HI>partiality</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. In June preceding a memorial again&s;t it was carried to the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, by Mr. John Paine, and Mr. Samuel Peck, &s;igned by a large number of men; but it was rejected; as a like memorial al&s;o was in 1754.</P>
<P N="6">VI. As to bapti&s;m, di&s;putes about it were fir&s;t brought into the church in Titicut in Augu&s;t, 1749; and a di&s;agreeable temper was &s;oon di&s;covered, and much heat in debates, for three weeks. And as the author was e&s;&s;aying, in his &s;ecret approaches to the throne of grace, to give up this ca&s;e to God, a &s;ud|den conclu&s;ion came in, that the Bapti&s;t way is cer|tainly right, becau&s;e nature fights &s;o again&s;t it. And he was hurried on to preach it up the next day; which cau&s;ed confu&s;ion among the hearers, and returned with a horrible gloom over his own mind; and he was turned back to his former prac|tice. Hereupon a number of the church drew off, and ten per&s;ons were baptized in September by El|der Moulton. About three months after, when the heat of controver&s;y was abated, the que&s;tion was put to his con&s;cience, in his retired hours, Where is it, and in what relation to the church do tho&s;e &s;tand, who are baptized, but not converted? He could &s;ee that all the circumci&s;ed were obliged to keep the pa&s;&s;over; and had &s;een that there was no half-way in the Chri&s;tian church, nor any war|rant
<PB N="209" REF="018336_0224_0FA5D02F5B073850">to admit any to communion therein without a credible profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith. No tongue can tell the di&s;tre&s;s he now felt. The neglect of go&s;pel di&s;cipline a little before, lay heavy upon his mind; and the di&s;putes and divi&s;ions in the church greatly added to his burthen. And near the clo&s;e of 1749, a number of people in Ea&s;ton and Norton made &s;o high a profe&s;&s;ion of being led into believers bap|ti&s;m, that no ordained mini&s;ter in the land would do to admini&s;ter it to them. But they met by a place of water, and one would baptize another, and then he the next; &s;o that about twenty per&s;ons were dipped, by four or five admini&s;trators among them|&s;elves. Parting from their lawful wives and hu&s;|bands, and taking of others, immediately followed, until &s;ome ba&s;tard children were born among them, with many other abominations. Could the author therefore have di&s;covered any foundation for his former practice, he would mo&s;t certainly have con|tinued therein: But all his efforts failing, he was at la&s;t brought to the old &s;tandard; &s;o as to leave good men and bad men out of the que&s;tion, and en|quire, <HI>what &s;aith the &s;cripture?</HI> Hereby a &s;ettlement was granted, and he was baptized Augu&s;t 22, 1751.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THE difficulties were become &s;o great in the church, that a mutual Council of five churches was called, October 2; who after long labour brought &s;ixteen members to renew their covenant to go on together, and the Council declared fellow|&s;hip with them, and cen&s;ured all the re&s;t, and &s;o|lemnly charged tho&s;e &s;ixteen to follow all the other members with labour, until they were recovered to fellow&s;hip, or cut off by di&s;cipline. Three of the &s;ixteen were Bapti&s;ts, and no hint was given of breaking communion between the two denomina|tions. The author had no objection then again&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="018336_0225_0FA5D0301F47C060">their advice, but was held back about a month by inward di&s;couragements. But getting relief there|from, he came forward, and was freely received in his office by all but two of tho&s;e brethren; and they refu&s;ed to receive him, unle&s;s he would baptize in|fants. A clo&s;e labour was hereby brought on, and it was mo&s;t fully declared, that we meant to give free liberty to every one to act according to his con|&s;cience in that re&s;pect; but to require a man to ad|mini&s;ter an ordinance in the name of God, which he &s;aw no command for, was requiring him to wrong his own con&s;cience, to &s;atisfy others. Yet tho&s;e two brethren, who had lately renewed their convenant, refu&s;ed to walk with their elder, or with tho&s;e who received him, unle&s;s he would &s;prinkle infants. For this &s;chi&s;m in the body they were cen&s;ured; and, after ten months labours, were excommunicated. In the mid&s;t of which time five Bapti&s;ts were cen|&s;ured for refu&s;ing to commune with this body. Tho&s;e two were no &s;ooner ca&s;t out than they &s;ent for three of the churches who were of the former Council, who met here November 1, 1752, and fully ju&s;tified them, and cen&s;ured all who had acted again&s;t them, and declared that unle&s;s they mani|fe&s;ted repentance therefor, they mu&s;t <HI>mark and avoid them.</HI> Strangers cannot conceive how unaccount|able it appeared, for eminent fathers thus to treat their children this year, for acting according to their own &s;olemn charge the year before. It alarmed the Bapti&s;ts in general, and our elders Sprague, Babcock and Worden, being &s;ent for, met here in Council January 31, 1753; and, in conjunction with many of both denominations that came, they appointed a general meeting of the&s;e churches, and &s;ent out citations therefor. In an&s;wer to which twenty-&s;even churches met at Exeter, May 23, and
<PB N="211" REF="018336_0226_0FA5D030F08376D0">unanimou&s;ly agreed, that a turning to or from infant bapti&s;m was not a cen&s;urable evil; but that each &s;hould leave the other with God, according to Phil. iii. 15. And by their advice a Council met at Mid|dleborough July 11; under who&s;e influence tho&s;e cen&s;ures, both of the two and of the five members, were revoked, and fellow&s;hip was again declared with this church. But the elders at Canterbury and Plainfield refu&s;ed to come to the Exeter meet|ing, or to concur with the&s;e &s;ub&s;equent acts. For this Elder Babcock refu&s;ed to act with Elder Paine in an ordination at Stonington, May 29, 1753, though he did not then give his rea&s;ons therefor. And becau&s;e he afterwards gave them to that church, and they &s;ent to Canterbury to enquire into the matter, a proce&s;s was commenced again&s;t Babcock as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, for laying in complaints again&s;t his brethren to another church than their own. This charge was carried to his church, but not &s;ucceeding there, Paine joined with Babcock, in calling a general meeting at Stonington May 29, 1754, to &s;earch into the&s;e matters, that the churches might come into a go&s;pel &s;ettlement. Elders and brethren from forty churches then met, viz. from twenty-four in Connecticut, eight in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, &s;even in Rhode-I&s;land, and one on Long-I&s;land. After long and tedious debates, the que&s;|tion was put to every member of the conference, whether any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence was given to the Bapti&s;ts in the re&s;ult at Middleborough of Novem|ber 1, 1752? Thirty-&s;even &s;aid nay; thirty-five &s;aid yea, and &s;even cho&s;e to be &s;ilent about it. And after hard attempts to ca&s;t the blame of the breach upon the Bapti&s;ts, and manife&s;ting a willingne&s;s to commune with Chri&s;tians who wanted light for in|fant bapti&s;m, Mr. Paine and &s;undry others declar|ed

<P N="8">VIII. "A HOLDS out his principles. 1. He de|clares he will admini&s;ter bapti&s;m to none but adult believers. 2. That he will go to any church, and baptize all per&s;ons that were baptized in infancy, If they will declare they were di&s;&s;atisfied with their infant bapti&s;m. B holds out his principles, and declares that he will admini&s;ter bapti&s;m to all adult believers and their infant &s;eed, and that he doth it in the name of the Trinity, in obedience of a divine precept. Now the que&s;tion is, be the&s;e two per&s;ons agreed in their principles? or will there be any e&s;&s;ential difference between their prac|tice, if they practi&s;e according to their profe&s;&s;ed principles? Is it a matter of indifference for a pa&s;tor of a church to &s;ay, he baptizes an infant in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, in the fulfilment of a divine precept? My dear bro|ther, if you can reconcile the above principles, in the e&s;&s;ential parts thereof, you will remove all the grounds of bars and di&s;putes: But if there be an e&s;&s;ential difference in the above articles, and con|&s;equently in the practice on them, then there is an Achan in the camp; and no marvel that I&s;rael hath, in all reformations, been troubled therewith. Either B &s;ins in making infants the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, or A in cutting them off. Now it is clear to me, that infants were once the &s;ubjects to be &s;ealed with the &s;eal of Abraham's faith; there|fore, if I allow a per&s;on to have Abraham's faith I mu&s;t &s;hew that God hath forbid the &s;eal to be put to their &s;eed, or el&s;e forbid it in my own name;
<PB N="213" REF="018336_0228_0FA5D0326E4E2810">for there is but one covenant of grace, and that had Abraham's &s;eed in it. Now if we allow a per&s;on to have Abraham's faith, why not his pri|vilege? I pray God to pinch up our minds, until the troubler be found; for it is not a divi&s;ion be|tween Pedo and Antipedobapti&s;ts, but promi&s;cuou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns through the body of Chri&s;tians, and will rend all cords of union between the dear lambs of God but what are made by human and party bands.

<P>THUS &s;pake that eminent father of the&s;e churches, though the author then knew nothing of it, and never &s;aw him nor his brother after that meeting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Solomon Paine died, after a &s;hort illne&s;s, October 25, 1754; as Mr. Stevens al&s;o did November 13, 1755. They were principal leaders among tho&s;e churches.</NOTE>. A &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion was &s;till held by many, that if a right temper was in exerci&s;e, Chri&s;tians might and ought to commune together, although of dif|ferent judgments about bapti&s;m. The author and his church laboured earne&s;tly to go on in that way; but when &s;ome pious members manife&s;ted a belief of duty to be buried in bapti&s;m, others refu&s;ed to go to the water to &s;ee it done, becau&s;e, in their view, they were already baptized, and to repeat it would be taking the &s;acred name in vain. And when an elder came and &s;prinkled &s;ome infants, the Bapti&s;ts felt a like difficulty, though they did not leave the meeting where it was done. Being unwilling to part, attempts were made to convince each other, which led into warm debates; to avoid which, at the next meeting, each one was afraid
<PB N="214" REF="018336_0229_0FA5D035E2212EC0">to mention the &s;ubject, le&s;t it &s;hould cau&s;e di&s;|putes. Thus edification, the great end of Chri&s;|tian &s;ociety, was marred in&s;tead of being promoted, by that which is called large communion. It was &s;o far from an&s;wering to that name, that, with their utmo&s;t endeavours, the author and his brethren could never arrive at communion in the ordinance of the &s;upper, from September, 1754, to the end of 1755. To be un&s;ettled in religious matters was very di&s;agreeable to the author; but he could not avoid a fre&s;h &s;earch into the cau&s;e of the&s;e dif|ficulties.</P>
<P>THE arguments of the beloved Bunyan, for a free communion with all &s;aints, had before ap|peared conclu&s;ive to him and others; but a review of them di&s;covered his mi&s;takes. One argument is, that plain laws of old were &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ed with; as circumci&s;ion was omitted in the wilder|ne&s;s; David eat of the &s;hew-bread that was not lawful for him, and the people in Hezekiah's time eat of the pa&s;&s;over, otherwi&s;e than it was written. But it was found upon &s;earch, that each of the&s;e were extraordinary ca&s;es, which were not repeat|ed; and therefore could afford no plea for di&s;|pen&s;ing with rule at ordinary times. And as to Bunyan's capital argument, which is, <HI>God hath received them,</HI> therefore we ought to; it was ob|&s;erved, that his example is often inimitable by us; but as far as it is imitable, it is always <HI>in the truth.</HI> Hence truth is never to be violated for any one, no, not to &s;ave natural life, which all lawful means &s;hould be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve. And truth &s;o clearly requires bapti&s;m before the &s;upper, that Pedobapti&s;ts do never come to the table with any but &s;uch as are baptized in their e&s;teem. Nei|ther could we under&s;tandingly act in being buried
<PB N="215" REF="018336_0230_0FA5D0375D1BC070">in bapti&s;m, until we were convinced that what was done to us in infancy was not go&s;pel bapti&s;m; therefore to commune at the Lord's table with any who were only &s;prinkled in infancy, is parting with truth, by practically &s;aying they are baptized, when we do not believe they are. I &s;ince find that the learned and pious Dr. Watts allows this argument to be ju&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rational foundation of the Chri&s;tian church, p. 189, 260.</NOTE>, though many &s;till wrangle again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="9">IX. A NUMBER of brethren being convinced that though freedom towards all men ought to be &s;hown, as far as it can be in the truth, yet that truth limits church communion to believers bap|tized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of their own faith, con&s;ti|tuted a church at Middleborough, in this way, on January 26, 1756; and, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Bo&s;ton and Rehoboth, the author was in&s;talled their pa&s;|tor the 23d of July following. Having in the mean time publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e from Gal. iv. 31, to &s;hew that Abraham's fir&s;t &s;on that was circumci&s;|ed was the <HI>&s;on of the bond-woman,</HI> an emblem of the national church of the Jews; in di&s;tinction from regenerate &s;ouls, the <HI>&s;piritual &s;eed of Abraham,</HI> of whom the Chri&s;tian church was con&s;tituted; into which neither natural birth, nor the doings of others, can rightly bring any one &s;oul, without their own con&s;ent. Upon the&s;e principles was the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Plymouth county then found|ed; it being the fir&s;t of this per&s;ua&s;ion, in an extent of country above an hundred miles long, from Bel|lingham to the end of Cape-Cod, and near fifty miles wide, betwixt Bo&s;ton and Rehoboth, where|in are now &s;eventeen churches.</P>
<P>MEN who regard carnal ea&s;e, or temporal honor and intere&s;t, more than truth, cannot be plea&s;ed
<PB N="216" REF="018336_0231_0FA5D039C1F290D0">with the foregoing account of things; but their &s;corn, or rage is contemptible, when compar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the divine favour or di&s;plea&s;ure. Young Chri&s;tians who highly regard God's favour and fear his frowns, yet are far from being aware of how nearly truth and error may be blended in hone&s;t minds; and nothing can teach them the nature and effects thereof like experience. The Spirit of Truth taught Peter that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t the Son of the living God: But Peter was greatly mi&s;taken, in concluding from thence that he had inherent &s;trength enough to die for his Saviour. On the day of Penteco&s;t he and others received va&s;tly greater light and &s;trength; yet how much were they &s;till mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that all who were con|verted to Chri&s;tianity mu&s;t be circumci&s;ed? And though a new vi&s;ion from heaven taught Peter to go freely to the Gentiles, yet what <HI>di&s;&s;imulation</HI> was he and Barnabas afterwards in&s;nared in about tho&s;e matters! Gal. ii. 11&mdash;14. Great care is ever to be taken, not to condemn any thing but what is really evil, nor to expo&s;e what is &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily. If the author has done either in the preceding nar|rative, he de&s;ires to lie open to conviction. It is drawn from a large number of original papers and records, which any who de&s;ire it are welcome to &s;ee. His experience in the&s;e affairs has very &s;en&s;ibly taught him, that mi&s;taken conclu&s;ions are often drawn from good premi&s;es; and al&s;o, that wrong judgments are the natural effect of erroneous prin|ciples. In particular that truth is not to be em|braced only becau&s;e nature fights again&s;t it, nor re|jected becau&s;e bad men have profe&s;&s;ed it, or good men have fought again&s;t it. Al&s;o that the holding of internal union as the rule of church communion, naturally leads to the cen&s;uring of brethren of both
<PB N="217" REF="018336_0232_0FA5D039E397D100">denominations, if they refu&s;e to act according to that rule, which is making our affection to creatures the &s;tandard in&s;tead of the revealed will of God. Likewi&s;e to cen&s;ure &s;erious Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e of difference in opinion about wor&s;hip, in the &s;ame manner as if they were guilty of a plain breach of moral precept, is doubtle&s;s erroneous. In a word, truth is to be received and hold for its own &s;ake, and not upon any exterior motives; and it is never to be violated or for&s;aken for any con&s;ideration what&s;oever.</P>

So much &s;moke and du&s;t was rai&s;ed hereby, as opened a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect to a number of expelling the ancient plan of orthodoxy, under the name of bigotry and tyranny; which &s;aid they "Degrades men from their ju&s;t rank, into the cla&s;s of brutes.

<P N="3">III. THE Bapti&s;t meeting at Wallingford was removed twenty miles, to Southington, four years before Mr. Whittle&s;ey died, in 1756. Yet in two years, among twenty candidates whom they tried, they could not agree in the &s;ettlement of a mini&s;ter in that pari&s;h. Therefore on April 26,
<PB N="220" REF="018336_0235_0FA5D03C1B80E0D8">1758, four mini&s;ters advi&s;ed them to &s;end to Cam|bridge for a candidate; in compliance wherewith a man came, highly recommended, from thence. And in June they gave him a call to &s;ettle, with an offer of Two Hundred Pounds &s;ettlement, and a &s;alary of Eighty Pounds the fir&s;t year, Ninety the &s;econd, and an Hundred a year ever after, as long as he continued their mini&s;ter. This call he car|ried to Cambridge, where he was advi&s;ed to ac|cept of it; and he returned and publi&s;hed his ac|ceptance thereof, and his ordination was appointed to be on October 11. And now we are to &s;ee more of what their Saybrook platform is. Like civil Courts, it does not hinder per&s;ons and &s;ocieties from voluntary agreements among them&s;elves, where there is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> oppo&s;ition; but when conten|tions break out, it was de&s;igned as a known and fixed tribunal, within each circuit, &s;o that no party might have "<HI>Liberty</HI> to choo&s;e their own Council where they plea&s;ed;" as Dr. Cotton Ma|ther declares, who well under&s;tood it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ratio Diciplinae, p. 183.</NOTE>. Yet in this ca&s;e, though much oppo&s;ition aro&s;e again&s;t &s;aid candidate, before his ordination was appointed, his party &s;ent for &s;everal mini&s;ters out of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, for one out of the county of Hartford, as well as for &s;uch as &s;uited them in their own coun|ty, to be the ordaining Council<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Todd, p. 11.</NOTE>. Before their call was given, a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, who was a father in that church, went to talk with their can|didate about his doctrine; but was an&s;wered in a &s;hort and angry manner; and the candidate &s;aid, "He was too young to be examined; and if there were any objections again&s;t what he had delivered in preaching, he would an&s;wer them before the ordaining Council." To this te&s;timony the Ju&s;tice
<PB N="221" REF="018336_0236_0FA5D03CF9437838">has &s;igned his name. Two others of the &s;ociety al&s;o certify, that they waited upon him &s;ome time before his &s;ettlement and &s;alary were voted, to obtain &s;atisfaction about his principles; "And particularly de&s;ired him to let them know his &s;entiments with regard to original &s;in, and the &s;aints per&s;everance; the power of free-will, and falling from grace;" but he refu&s;ed to tell them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eells, p. 9, 10.</NOTE>. Therefore the Con&s;ociation was convened at Wallingford, the day before the time appointed for his ordination, to hear and act upon a com|plaint exhibited again&s;t &s;aid candidate; but he and his party prote&s;ted again&s;t their meeting at that time, and refu&s;ed to be tried by them. And a mini&s;ter from Hingham, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and &s;ix more of tho&s;e who were &s;ent for, formed them|&s;elves into a Council, and went into their meeting-hou&s;e, and heard the candidate for ordination vin|dicate him&s;elf, before judges that his accu&s;ers re|fu&s;ed to be tried by. Though while they were there, they received a paper, &s;igned by ninety-five inhabitants of that pari&s;h, who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of about half the freehold e&s;tate therein, de&s;iring them not to proceed in the ordination. With this paper came a me&s;&s;age from their Con&s;ociation, warning and be&s;eeching them not then to proceed: Yet in the face of all this, tho&s;e mini&s;ters went on and ordained &s;aid candidate, as the pa&s;tor of that pari&s;h. Such an in&s;tance was never before known in this land; therefore their Con&s;ociation adjourned, and called in the &s;outhern Con&s;ociation of Hartford county to act with them in the affair. But all their united efforts could not bring &s;aid party to &s;ubmit to a trial before them; therefore, at their meeting of April 3, 1759, the &s;entence of non-communion

And it is cer|tain, that all their proceedings again&s;t Mr. Robbins were upon the complaints of a &s;mall party, con|trary to the minds of a large majority, both of his church and congregation. And tho&s;e attempts were to root out a mini&s;ter who was well &s;ettled; the&s;e were to &s;ettle one who had preached in the place but a few weeks before he received his call, when the oppo&s;ition openly appeared. From all which we learn, that what they call free-will pow|er, is a power to conform to or di&s;pen&s;e with rule, divine or human, as they judge be&s;t, and to plead
<PB N="225" REF="018336_0240_0FA5D03FF71DAE20">liberty of con&s;cience for &s;o doing. Yea, a liberty to brand di&s;&s;enters from their judgments with as many ill names as they plea&s;e, but to deny that liberty to others concerning them&s;elves. From hence we al&s;o learn, that their Con&s;ociation power over the churches, in&s;tead of preventing, <HI>cau&s;eth divi&s;ions and offences,</HI> contrary to the doctrine of Chri&s;t. It now cau&s;ed a divi&s;ion in Wallingford, and tho&s;e who adhered to the ancient faith of their churches were forced to draw off, and form another church, and &s;ettle another mini&s;ter; and the &s;ecu|lar arm, from whence their Con&s;ociation power was derived and is &s;upported, upholds &s;aid mi|ni&s;ter in that place, and has called him to preach an election &s;ermon at Hartford, who&s;e name and title now is James Dana, D. D.</P>
<P N="5">V. THESE remarks are greatly confirmed by &s;ucceeding events. Sandeman's letters on Theron and A&s;pa&s;io came out in 1758, which give tho&s;e teachers a mo&s;t &s;evere la&s;hing who point their hearers to &s;omething good in them&s;elves, for en|couragement, in&s;tead of Chri&s;t's fini&s;hed atone|ment. Mr. Ebenezer White, of Danbury, rea|dily adopted the&s;e &s;entiments, and mo&s;t of his hear|ers al&s;o; but a minor part of them were &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed therewith, as to enter a complaint again&s;t him to the ea&s;tern A&s;&s;ociation of Fairfield county. Upon hearing of which, he and a large majority of his church met June 28, 1763, and renounced the Saybroo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> platform; though they did not withdraw their fellow&s;hip from the churches that were under it. In Augu&s;t the Con&s;ociation in that circuit met at Danbury, and viewing the ca&s;e to be difficult, they adjourned, and called in the we&s;tern Con&s;ociation of that county, to act with them. After much labour, at their meeting of
<PB N="226" REF="018336_0241_0FA5D040CA1C93C8">March 27, 1764, they rejected Mr. White and the majority of his church, as men who had &s;epa|rated from their con&s;titution; and owned the mi|nority who adhered to it as the fir&s;t church and &s;o|ciety in Danbury, declaring that they were re|lea&s;ed from all obligations to Mr. White as their mini&s;ter, and that the Con&s;ociation could not re|commend him as &s;uch to any other people, until he gave them &s;atisfaction. But this la&s;t clau&s;e was pro|te&s;ted again&s;t as unrea&s;onably &s;evere, by five mini|&s;ters of their number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White's narrative, p. 22, 23.</NOTE>. Mr. Izrahiah Wetmore was one of them, who in an election &s;ermon at Hart|ford nine years after gave an explicit te&s;timo|ny again&s;t any attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h the church of Chri&s;t by human laws. Another of them was Mr. David Jud&s;on, of Newtown, who in 1770 re|nounced the Saybrook &s;cheme, as his church al&s;o did in 1773; and &s;everal meetings of the Con&s;ocia|tion were called upon it, and pamphlets were pub|li&s;hed again&s;t them by Mr. Jud&s;on, and for them by Mr. Robert Ro&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1762 Mr. Ro&s;s publi&s;hed a laboured piece at New-Ha|ven, again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts and others, who had &s;eparated from his party; wherein he advanced facts and arguments to prove them to be deluded enthu&s;ia&s;ts. One of his plaine&s;t facts is, that a few fooli&s;h people at Wrentham, an hundred and &s;ixty miles from him, once ventured to appoint a time to ordain a mini&s;ter over them, who had not con&s;ented thereto; and they were confound|ed in it.

<P N="6">VI. IF we again turn our eyes to Bo&s;ton, the &s;ame temper pre&s;ents it&s;elf to view. The Separate &s;ociety, that began there in 1742, growing &s;mall, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their mini&s;ter, and di&s;&s;olved their &s;ociety; and a pari&s;h upon Ca&s;co-Bay called and &s;ettled him
<PB N="227" REF="018336_0242_0FA5D0415AAFAE28">as their pa&s;tor. This di&s;plea&s;ed a few of the inha|bitants &s;o much, that they brought their complaints to Bo&s;ton, in 1760; and were not only &s;et off them|&s;elves to another pari&s;h, but procured a general law of the Province to prohibit the &s;ettling of any mi|ni&s;ter for the future, in their way, who had not an academical degree, or an approbation from the majority of the &s;ettled mini&s;ters of the county where the pari&s;h lies. At the &s;ame time their Grand Jury, in their &s;everal County Courts, were charged by the Judges from year to year to enter complaints upon oath again&s;t every pari&s;h that neglected to &s;ettle and &s;upport an orthodox mini&s;ter. But about this time an Epi&s;copal church was erected near the college in Cambridge, who&s;e mini&s;ter, at the opening of it, exclaimed mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t the fathers of New-England, and their doctrines, and publi&s;hed &s;ome high commendations of the Epi&s;copal way. This moved the popular author before named, at Bo&s;ton, to appear again&s;t that party. And having quoted the 9th, 11th, 13th and 17th articles of the church of England, which &s;peak of original &s;in, ju&s;tification by faith in Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s, works done before ju&s;tification, and of prede&s;|tination and election, he &s;ays, "To &s;peak &s;incere|ly, I own it is my <HI>private</HI> opinion, that it has been too common a thing for people in New-England to expre&s;s them&s;elves in a manner <HI>ju&s;tly exception|able</HI> upon the&s;e points, however agreeably both to the <HI>letter and &s;pirit</HI> of the articles afore&s;aid; but yet, I believe, not more exceptionably than many emi|nent divines of the church of England did in the la&s;t century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mayhew's ob&s;ervations upon the Epi&s;copal &s;ociety, 1763, p. 91, 92.</NOTE>."

VII. THE elde&s;t of the two brothers who were expelled out of Yale college publi&s;hed an e&s;&s;ay at Bo&s;ton, to prove that two of this author's &s;ermons were erroneous, about the per&s;on and atonement of Chri&s;t. Directly upon which it was declared in &s;ome of the Bo&s;ton papers, "That it was as much out of character for a gentleman of the Doc|tor's reputation to enter into a controver&s;y with Mr. Cleaveland, as it would for a general of an army to accept of a challenge from a &s;ubaltern."

Yet when Mayhew died June 9, 1766, Chauncy gave him a high character, in a funeral &s;ermon, and reflected upon his an&s;werer, calling him "An ob&s;cure per&s;on, without reputation;" but he could not at the &s;ame time conceal his own corruption.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. FOR Robert Sandeman, who&s;e writings had made a great &s;tir in this country, came over from Scotland, and landed at Bo&s;ton in October, 1764, and gathered a church in Bo&s;ton, another in Pro|vidence, and a third in Danbury. Therefore, to guard again&s;t his influence, Chauncy publi&s;hed a volume of &s;ermons in 1765, wherein he gives his ideas concerning fundamental points in the follow|ing words. Says he, "The original promi&s;e of life was not &s;u&s;pended upon <HI>perfect obedience</HI> to what is commonly called <HI>the natural or moral law of God.</HI> In contradiction hereto, I know it is &s;aid, by <HI>mo&s;t</HI> Chri&s;tian writers, that the fir&s;t man was &s;o placed under this law, that he mu&s;t work his way to life by <HI>perfectly</HI> doing all things commanded by it; in&s;o|much that he could not have obtained it but by a per|&s;evering obedience in every point of duty, without the lea&s;t failure. But this is &s;aid entirely without book. The &s;cripture nowhere in&s;inuates, that he was under <HI>&s;uch a covenant of works.</HI> It &s;ugge&s;ts, on the contrary, that God, in favour to him, did not put him upon &s;o <HI>&s;evere</HI> a trial for life. His trial, if we may believe the &s;acred record of it, was in a <HI>&s;ingle in&s;tance,</HI> and this not of doing, but of forbear|ing to do.&mdash;That which was made the te&s;t of Adam's &s;ubjection to God, was a command not of the moral but po&s;itive kind; a command, not deducible from rea&s;on, but known only by revelation.&mdash;It
<PB N="230" REF="018336_0245_0FA5D0469D079078">would be the exact truth, &s;hould I &s;ay, that the fir&s;t parents of men, while innocent, in common with their po&s;terity &s;ince the elap&s;e, could have obtained life in no way but that <HI>of grace through faith.</HI>" And after a laboured critici&s;m upon Rom. v. 12, he &s;ays, "The judicial &s;entence of God, occa&s;ioned by the offence of one man, is that which fa&s;tens <HI>death,</HI> with all its natural cau&s;es and appendages, upon the human kind; and 'tis IN CONSEQUENCE of this &s;en|tence, UPON mens coming into exi&s;tence under the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from it, that they <HI>&s;in</HI> them|&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chauncy's twelve &s;ermons, p. 18&mdash;20, 23.</NOTE>." This is his account, accented in this manner. From whence we may &s;ee, that his prin|ciples were contrary to mo&s;t Chri&s;tian writers about original righteou&s;ne&s;s, original &s;in, the nature of grace, and the ju&s;tice of God in his government of the world. For the moral law is to love God with all our powers, and to love our neighbours as our|&s;elves; which can never be called <HI>&s;evere,</HI> without implicitly denying his infinite excellency and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. And though the precept concerning the forbidden fruit could only be known by pure re|velation, yet by violating of it man revolted from heaven, and &s;eized upon the earth as his own; and we are all born in that &s;tate of revolt, which is ori|ginal &s;in. And grace and works are as di&s;tinct as <HI>wages</HI> and <HI>gifts,</HI> Rom. vi. 23, xi. 6. Wages can|not be ju&s;tly claimed but upon doing the work; while the mo&s;t proper &s;ubjects of gifts are &s;uch as are &s;en&s;ibly guilty and helple&s;s. Neither can the ju&s;tice of God, in &s;ending death upon infants, be clearly vindicated in any other way, than by view|ing them as &s;inners in our fir&s;t public head. And to deny God's right to con&s;titute him as &s;uch, im|plicitly
<PB N="231" REF="018336_0246_0FA5D047766E4BB0">militates again&s;t his ju&s;tifying &s;ouls by the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;econd Adam.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. DIVISIONS and perver&s;e di&s;putings, in all parts of the land, brought the churches into terrible circum&s;tances; and each party were ready to ca&s;t the blame of it upon others. And a national war began in 1755, which ever tends to corrupt the morals, as well as to de&s;troy the pro|perty and lives of men. Its influence was very exten&s;ive; and it i&s;&s;ued in February, 1763, in the ce&s;&s;ion of the whole continent of America North of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to the Crown of Great-Britain; a va&s;t territory indeed. Many rejoiced greatly upon this occa&s;ion, imagining that our wars, which for near a century had been frequent and very di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing, were now come to an end. But, alas! to the whole Briti&s;h empire, the&s;e were but the beginning of &s;orrows. Upon the conque&s;t of Quebec, Go|vernor Wentworth, of New-Hamp&s;hire, appoint|ed a public thank&s;giving upon Saturday, Nov. 10,
<PB N="232" REF="018336_0247_0FA5D048388CAB58">1759, becau&s;e it was the birth-day of an aged and good King; and he &s;aid in his proclamation, "The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are hereby directed to per|form divine &s;ervice, in their re&s;pective congrega|tions, in the morning only, the afternoon being devoted to public <HI>rejoicings,</HI> and lawful <HI>diver&s;ions.</HI>" But when the day came, in&s;tead of rejoicings, the Governor had to mourn over the dead corps of his only &s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Langdon's &s;ermon on &s;aid day, p. 45, 46.</NOTE>. And on October 25, 1760, that aged and good King was taken from the nation. When the news of it arrived, the pa&s;tor of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton preached from tho&s;e words of Solomon, <HI>Wo to thee, O land, when thy King is a child;</HI> which is a truth that others have had occa&s;ion to remember &s;ince. And becau&s;e the great reformation, in and after the year 1740, was begun and mainly carried on among Pedobapti&s;ts, many had a&s;&s;erted that the Bapti&s;t principles always came in at the tail of a reformation, when the life of reli|gion was gone, and people were for &s;ettling down upon the bare letter of &s;cripture. For a dozen years, this argument was much harped upon, un|til it was &s;ilenced in the&s;e parts by clear evidence to the contrary.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough ordained their pa&s;tor on January 26, 1758. And our third church in the town was formed and or|ganized in 1761. And though we have three meeting-hou&s;es of our denomination in this town, yet the neare&s;t are nine miles apart, and the farthe&s;t above eleven. On April 1, 1761, Mr. William Carpenter, and his church at Norton, were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the Bapti&s;t order, and he enjoyed a con|&s;iderable ble&s;&s;ing upon his labours both there and
<PB N="233" REF="018336_0248_0FA5D048F8A73450">in Attleborough, and &s;ome revivings were granted in &s;everal other parts of the land. But a much greater work came on in June, 1762, in the third Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough, and prevailed through the year, and extended its ble&s;&s;ings into other &s;ocieties and denominations. The &s;ubjects of this work di&s;covered much more of fruitfulne&s;s in their under&s;tandings, and good government of their pa&s;&s;ions, than appeared in the revival twenty years before. And it was very evident, that the labours of Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters were the chief means of beginning and carrying on this work; which was powerful, undoubtedly, to the &s;aving benefit of many &s;ouls. And though the world &s;aid, they &s;pent &s;o much time in religious exerci&s;es, that they would all &s;tarve, or come to want and mi&s;ery&punc; yet the contrary was remarkably demon&s;trated, by the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence: For in many places almo&s;t the whole &s;taff of bread was cut off, by a &s;evere drought; while a few &s;ea&s;onable &s;howers, in the parts where people were &s;o much engaged in religion, cau&s;ed not only a good &s;up|ply for them&s;elves, but al&s;o a large quantity to impart to others the next &s;pring. This was very convincing to many. Divine influences upon the &s;ouls of men were more exten&s;ively granted after|wards. Near the clo&s;e of 1763, &s;uch a work began under Mr. Cleaveland's mini&s;try in Ip&s;wich, as cau&s;ed the addition of ninety communicants to his church, in le&s;s than a year. A like ble&s;&s;ing was granted in Providence and in Norwich, and a great|er one on the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land, of which Mr. Buell publi&s;hed a narrative. The work ex|tended to New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and el&s;ewhere. The beginning and progre&s;s of a revival at Wood|&s;tock was al&s;o very remarkable. As Mr. Noah
<PB N="234" REF="018336_0249_0FA5D049AB0444A0">Alden pa&s;&s;ed through the town in December, 1763, he preached a &s;ermon to a few people, one of whom had been a chief leader in mirth and frolick|ing, among young people there: But God was plea&s;ed to direct an arrow of conviction to his heart, which ended in conver&s;ion in March, 1764. No &s;ooner did this news come abroad, than four of his former companions went one evening to try if they could not draw him back to his former ways again. He willingly retired with them to an adjacent &s;chool-hou&s;e, where they &s;pent the evening to|gether. But, in&s;tead of turning him back to vanity, he prevailed with them to appoint a religious meet|ing the next week, which led on to others of that kind, until a large harve&s;t of &s;ouls was granted there. And who could help rejoicing, to &s;ee a large number of young people turned from lying vani|ties, to an earne&s;t engagement in religion, and the great affairs of the &s;oul and eternity! Yet the mi|ni&s;ter and profe&s;&s;ors with whom they met for wor|&s;hip, finding that a cold formality could not give them &s;atisfaction, appointed a fa&s;t, and called in the neighbouring mini&s;ters to a&s;&s;i&s;t therein; who fell to exclaiming again&s;t fal&s;e teachers, Satan's turning him&s;elf into an angel of light, &s;eparations, Anabapti&s;m, &amp;c. which plainly taught tho&s;e young believers, that edification, the great end of Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, was not to be enjoyed in that way. And being convinced of the truth of believers bap|ti&s;m, a church was con&s;tituted in that order in Fe|bruary, 1766; and on May 29, 1768, the man who had been their chief leader from vanity to real reli|gion was ordained their pa&s;tor; under who&s;e mini&s;tra|tions great ble&s;&s;ings have been granted &s;ince. And &s;uch a door is now opening for the removal of ancient prejudices, as had not been before in many ages.</P>

III. THE covenant of circumci&s;ion gave tho&s;e who were born in it a right to treat all others, both as to wor&s;hip and commerce, as no others had any right to treat them. A right to office al&s;o in that church was hereditary. When our Saviour came, he fulfilled the law both moral and ceremonial, and aboli&s;hed tho&s;e hereditary di&s;tinctions among man|kind. But in the centuries following, deceitful philo&s;ophy took away the name which God has given to that covenant (Acts vii. 8) and added the name <HI>grace</HI> to it; from whence came the doc|trine, that <HI>dominion is founded in grace.</HI> And al|though this latter name has been exploded by many, yet the root of it has been tenaciou&s;ly held fa&s;t and taught in all colleges and &s;uperior places of learning, as far as Chri&s;tianity has extended, until the pre&s;ent time; whereby natural affection, edu|cation, temporal intere&s;t, and &s;elf righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices in the world, have all con|&s;pired to bind people in that way, and to bar their minds again&s;t equal liberty and believers bapti&s;m. But the writings of our learned mini&s;ters in Eng|land have communicated much light in this coun|try; to which more was added by the travels and labours of our &s;outhern fathers and brethren. And hereby the Philadelphia A&s;&s;ociation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A yearly meeting of the Bapti&s;t churches in tho&s;e parts, which began in 1707.</NOTE> obtained &s;uch an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehen&s;ion that it was practicable and ex|pedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-I&s;land, under the chief direction of the Bapti&s;ts; wherein education might be promoted, and &s;uperi|or learning obtained, free of any &s;ectarian religious te&s;ts. And Mr. James Manning, who took his fir&s;t degree in New-Jer&s;ey college in September,
<PB N="236" REF="018336_0251_0FA5D04B400F51E0">1762, was e&s;teemed a &s;uitable leader in this im|portant work. Therefore on a voyage to Halifax, in July, 1763, he called in at Newport, and pro|po&s;ed the affair to the Honorable Samuel Ward, John Gardner, Jo&s;ias Lyndon, and other Bapti&s;t gen|tlemen and friends; who readily concurred there|with, and entered upon the u&s;e of means to accom|pli&s;h it. And notwith&s;tanding &s;ecret contrivances and &s;ome open attempts again&s;t it, an ample char|ter for the purpo&s;e was granted by their Legi&s;lature, in February, 1764. In the &s;ummer following Mr. Manning removed to Warren, to preach to a &s;ociety newly formed there, and to begin the &s;chool. In September, 1765, he was cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the college, and on September 7, 1769, &s;even young gentlemen took their fir&s;t degrees therein, and it was removed to Providence the next &s;pring, where a further account of it may be given hereafter. Mr. Hezekiah Smith, a cla&s;s-mate with Mr. Man|ning, having travelled and laboured in the go&s;pel as far &s;outhward as Georgia, returned and came in|to New-England in the &s;pring of 1764, and was re|ceived to preach in the pulpits of Pedobapti&s;ts, in Providence, Rehoboth, Attleborough, Ip&s;wich, Newbury and other places, with an evident ble&s;&s;ing upon his labours. He expected to have returned to New-Jer&s;ey in the fall; but a vacant pari&s;h in Haverhill prevailed with him to alter his purpo&s;e, &s;o as to &s;tay and preach with them. Hereupon &s;ome mini&s;ters, who had freely received him as an itine|rant mini&s;ter, turned and exerted all their influence again&s;t him. Yet many &s;eals were granted to his mini&s;try, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Ha|verhill, on May 9, 1765, and he became their pa&s;tor, before which there was but one &s;mall Bapti&s;t church in any part of our country northward of

<P N="4">IV. DR. Benjamin Lord publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in 1763, wherein he &s;ays, "Some few, I perceive, begin to hearken to corrupt doctrines, which tend to their renouncing of their infant bapti&s;m, and their intere&s;t in the very ancient covenant with Abraham and his &s;eed; which you may be a&s;&s;ured is a dangerous road, and often i&s;&s;ueth very fatally, &mdash;witne&s;s the Anabapti&s;ts in Germany, 240 years ago, and others &s;ince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;e on &s;ober madne&s;s, p. 16, 17.</NOTE>." Directly upon which, he, with &s;ix other mini&s;ters, made &s;ome additions to Dickin&s;on's dialogue, and got it re-printed at Providence. In a preface to it, they &s;ay, "It &s;eems people do not think in &s;ea&s;on what a &s;inful, God-provoking and &s;oul-de&s;troying evil it is, to break over God's in&s;titutions: Fir&s;t be wavering, un&s;et|tled, not &s;tedfa&s;t in any right principles, nor in the covenant in which their infant bapti&s;m declares them to be; and then break covenant, and &s;eparate them&s;elves, as being in their own e&s;teem holie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and better than others. It is hid from them, that evil men and &s;educers wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e: It is hid from them, or rather they will not &s;ee, that they have fell into the way of Cain, and are in danger of peri&s;hing in the gain&s;aying of Core." A &s;ight of which, from the mini&s;ter where the author was born, and from whom he &s;eparated, moved him to &s;end the Doctor a printed letter in 1764, to open the inju&s;tice and abu&s;ive nature of &s;uch treatment of mankind; to which he returned no an&s;wer, but has &s;ince been more friendly to the Bapti&s;ts than be|fore. As Dr. Gill had an&s;wered &s;aid dialogue, a copy of this new edition was &s;ent to him. An ad|dition
<PB N="238" REF="018336_0253_0FA5D04CB81404A0">to it was made in the&s;e words, viz. &s;ay they, "St. Irenaeus, who lived about 114 years after the death of Chri&s;t, being the di&s;ciple of St. Polycarp, who was the di&s;ciple of St. John the Evangeli&s;t, &s;ays, in his epi&s;tle, <HI>ad.</HI> Rom. <HI>lib.</HI> 5, <HI>The church re|ceived a tradition from the apo&s;tles, to admini&s;ter bap|ti&s;m to little children, or infants.</HI> By <HI>tradition</HI> (&s;ay the&s;e mini&s;ters) the ancients meant the word of God, agreeable to that of the apo&s;tle, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 15, iii. 6.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said dialogue, p. 5.</NOTE>." Upon a &s;ight of this Dr. Gill pub|li&s;hed an adverti&s;ement, in the end of the London edition of his reply to Clark, wherein he charges this pa&s;&s;age as a <HI>forgery,</HI> and challenges the whole literary world to produce or point out any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age in the writings of Irenaeus, if they can; and &s;aid, "What a wretched cau&s;e mu&s;t infant bapti&s;m be, to require &s;uch management as this!" Various methods have been taken to wipe off this reproach, if po&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t I heard of was, that tho&s;e mini&s;ters &s;ent to Yale college, and there found a Latin tran&s;lation of Irenaeus, which had that pa&s;|&s;age in it. I was afterwards told, by one of their mo&s;t learned mini&s;ters, that the controver&s;y turned upon men's different opinions about the meaning of a Greek word or two; which therefore could not properly be called a forgery. But in 1781 Mr. Mo&s;es Hemmingway, of Wells, publi&s;hed a piece upon infant bapti&s;m, wherein he would per|&s;uade us, that it was only a &s;lip of memory in tho&s;e mini&s;ters to write Irenaeus, when Origen was the per&s;on intended; and therefore that Dr. Gill di&s;|covered a very bad temper, in making &s;uch a noi&s;e about &s;o harmle&s;s a mi&s;take. To which I reply, that tho&s;e mini&s;ters name Origen in their next para|graph,
<PB N="239" REF="018336_0254_0FA5D04D94A79518">and &s;ay he lived about 190 years after Chri&s;t. And how came a mini&s;ter 180 miles from them to know that they meant Origen, in the di&s;|puted pa&s;&s;age, when it does not appear that they ever knew it them&s;elves! However, the u&s;e of the &s;ecular arm has ever been their wor&s;t argument.</P>
<P N="5">V. WHEN the Legi&s;lature at Bo&s;ton broke in upon their own exempting law, in 1752, the Bapti&s;ts were &s;o much alarmed as to call &s;everal meetings, and to elect Mr. John Proctor their agent, to carry their ca&s;e to England; and they &s;ub&s;cribed above an Hundred Pounds therefor; and he drew a remon&s;trance upon the &s;ubject, which was pre&s;ented to the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, in May, 1754. It &s;tated matters &s;o plainly, that a motion was made by &s;ome to take the &s;igners of it into cu&s;tody; but Governor Shirley, newly returned from Europe, convinced them of the impolicy of &s;uch a &s;tep; and then they appointed a commit|tee to confer in a friendly way with the Bapti&s;ts; and matters were &s;hifted along, until the war came on, and their de&s;ign for England was dropt. At length all their exempting laws for Bapti&s;ts and Quakers expired, and the A&s;&s;embly of November 23, 1757, made a new one, wherein both deno|minations were again included in one act. By it no Bapti&s;ts were to be exempted from mini&s;terial taxes, in the places where they lived, "But &s;uch who&s;e names &s;hall be contained in a li&s;t or li&s;ts, to be taken and exhibited on or before the 20th of July annually, to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch town, di&s;trict, precinct or pari&s;h, and &s;igned by three principal members of the Anabapti&s;t church to which he or they belong, and the mini&s;ter thereof, if any there be, who &s;hall therein certify, that the per&s;ons who&s;e names are in&s;erted in the &s;aid li&s;t or li&s;ts are really
<PB N="240" REF="018336_0255_0FA5D04E4C0D4FD8">belonging thereto; that they verily believe them to be con&s;cientiou&s;ly of their per&s;ua&s;ion, and that they frequently and u&s;ually attend public wor&s;hip in &s;aid church on the Lord's days:" And the like was required of the Quakers. It was continued in force 13 years; and no tongue nor pen can fully de&s;cribe all the evils that were practi&s;ed under it. Only becau&s;e a difficulty aro&s;e, in 1763, between the third Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough and their mini&s;ter, &s;o as prevent his &s;igning a new certificate for them, they were all taxed to the pari&s;h wor&s;hip. And though, after di&s;tre&s;s was made upon &s;ome, they were advi&s;ed to apply to Plymouth Court for help; yet, in&s;tead of afford|ing any, they took Twenty Dollars more from them. And this was but a trifle, compared with what was done at Haverhill. For on May 23, 1765, a paper was given to their pari&s;h a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, which &s;aid, "This may inform you, that we who have formed our&s;elves into a Bapti&s;t church, ac|cording to the laws of this government re&s;pecting Bapti&s;ts, called by &s;ome Anabapti&s;ts, do hereby certify, that we verily believe that Major Edmond Moors, and Mr. John White, merchant, are con|&s;cientiou&s;ly of our per&s;ua&s;ion, and that they do frequently and u&s;ually attend public wor&s;hip with us on the Lord's days." Signed by the mini&s;ter and three principal members. Yet after this was given, the fir&s;t pari&s;h in &s;aid town met, and voted a large &s;um of money to build them a new meeting-hou&s;e; and taxed the Bapti&s;ts with the re&s;t, to pay both that and the pari&s;h mini&s;ter's &s;alary. And on September 15, 1766, they &s;eized a large quantity of Mr. White's goods for that tax. For this he &s;ued the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, at their County Court in Decem|ber; but the action was continued till March, and
<PB N="241" REF="018336_0256_0FA5D04EDC444C30">then was carried up to their Superior Court by way of demur. It was to have been tried at Ip&s;wich, in June, 1767; but it was then put off, becau&s;e two Bapti&s;t gentlemen, a Major and a Captain, were not allowed to be witne&s;&s;es of plain facts, concerning the &s;eizure of &s;aid goods; neither could a few hours be obtained, though reque&s;ted, to fetch other witne&s;&s;es from Haverhill. Their adver&s;a|ries then moved for an agreement, to have the ca&s;e tried the next term, and that the &s;ame &s;hould be a final trial. This was concurred with, and the agreement was entered by the clerk of the Court. The next term was at Salem, in November, when, after a fair and full hearing, the jury found for the Bapti&s;ts Thirty Pounds damages and co&s;ts. This was immediately complained of as exce&s;&s;ive high; there|fore, rather than not have the matter &s;ettled, Mr. White con&s;ented to remit Twelve Pounds of it; and the Court gave judgment to have the re&s;t paid. Yet the lawyers prevailed to have it referred to a fu|ture Court, whether they &s;hould not have another trial. And finally, in June, 1769, another trial was brought on, and the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts; which in all co&s;t them about Eighty Pounds. The rea&s;on given for violating an agree|ment in Court, about a final trial, was that it was a matter of great con&s;equence. And the plea which finally prevailed was built upon the ambiguous clau&s;e, belonging thereto, in their certificate law. It might mean a baptized church member, or only a &s;teady wor&s;hipper therewith. The Court owned that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atter was the intent of the law; yet, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e words were not in their certificate, though that meaning was full in it, the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts. And the rea&s;on given again&s;t admitting any of them as witne&s;s of plain
<PB N="242" REF="018336_0257_0FA5D04FB3C80310">facts, was becau&s;e they were parties concerned; that is, becau&s;e the Congregationali&s;ts are the majority, they may violate their promi&s;es to the minority, in matters of great importance; and may con&s;true words as they plea&s;e, and refu&s;e to allow the minority to be &s;o much as witne&s;&s;es of plain facts, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, the majority are not par|ties concerned!</P>
<P N="6">VI. THE noi&s;e about this ca&s;e reached as far as Philadelphia, and enquiry was made from thence, what it meant? We were told that a noted mini&s;ter, in New-England, wrote for an&s;wer, that where the Bapti&s;ts could get the power, they were as bad oppre&s;&s;ors as tho&s;e they complained &s;o much of; which &s;tory was framed from the following actions. On September 11, 1765, a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter was ordained in South-Brimfield, who&s;e preaching was agreeable to &s;ome Pedobapti&s;ts near him, who di&s;|liked a mini&s;ter then ordained in the ea&s;t part of that di&s;trict, of their denomination. They there|fore got &s;ome of the Bapti&s;ts to join with them in a petition for a new pari&s;h there. Upon which the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, January 15, 1766, in|corporated the we&s;t part of &s;aid di&s;trict into a new pari&s;h, inve&s;ted with all the powers and privileges, and &s;ubjected to all the duties of other pari&s;hes, without any mention of the Bapti&s;ts in the whole act. Hereupon the majority of this pari&s;h made a tax for the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, the mo&s;t of who&s;e church lived without tho&s;e bounds; and &s;ome within never concurred therewith. When the year came round, tho&s;e Pedobapti&s;ts moved to have the Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e voted to be the pari&s;h meeting-hou&s;e; and becau&s;e they would not thus give away a valuable hou&s;e, built for a Bapti&s;t church, and chiefly by men who did not live in
<PB N="243" REF="018336_0258_0FA5D0505872F110">that pari&s;h, the fir&s;t movers in &s;aid taxing &s;cheme refu&s;ed to pay their own tax. A gentleman from Bo&s;ton was then their collector; and, &s;eeing the matter mu&s;t be tried, he told me that he re&s;olved to act impartially; and therefore made di&s;tre&s;s up|on one Bapti&s;t, who had ever oppo&s;ed that &s;cheme, and upon one of the other party. The ca&s;e was then carried to Springfield Court, where it was &s;oon turned again&s;t the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter; and why? he had &s;tudied both Greek and Latin, but he had neither an academical degree, nor an approbation from the majority of the mini&s;ters in that county, which was their legal te&s;t of orthodoxy. He con|tinued the beloved pa&s;tor of that church, until he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e with joy, Augu&s;t 5, 1769; after which that church &s;ent a confe&s;&s;ion abroad, among their brethren, of their fault in not oppo&s;ing &s;aid taxing &s;cheme as they ought to have done, a copy whereof is before me. How mean then was the pretence, that the Bapti&s;ts hereby di&s;covered as bad an inclination as their opponents did! And as great meanne&s;s was di&s;covered at Haverhill. The want of learned mini&s;ters often been ca&s;t as a reproach upon the Bapti&s;t churches; but when &s;uch an one was obtained there, all manner of evil reports concerning him could not &s;uffice, without many in&s;tances of per&s;onal abu&s;e. A beetle was ca&s;t at him as he was walking the &s;treet one even|ing, which he took up and carried to his lodgings. Al&s;o a &s;tone, large enough to kill him, was ca&s;t through a window near his head, where he was in bed. And his enemies went &s;o far as to cut off his hor&s;e's mane and tail in the night, and to &s;et up a paper upon the door where he quartered, threatening wor&s;e treatment to him if he did not de|part; and as he went preach at Solomon Kim|bell's,
<PB N="244" REF="018336_0259_0FA5D0558E8F2470">in Bradford, Amos Milliken, a Sheriff, came at the head of a mob to prevent it. And as Mr. Smith was going to begin the wor&s;hip of God, the chair he &s;tood behind was &s;natched away; and the man of the hou&s;e tried in vain to quell the tu|mult, and to command peace in his own hou&s;e. At length Mr. Smith, with undaunted re&s;olution, engaged in his public work, and the rioters with|drew, and gave no further di&s;turbance to the exer|ci&s;e. And though &s;ome of them laid wait for him in the evening, yet it was &s;o ordered that he did not return home, until the coldne&s;s of the air forced them to quit their cruel de&s;ign. After Mr. Kim|bell's decea&s;e, his widow, who al&s;o was of the Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Haverhill, and had the &s;ame certified to Bradford a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, yet was taxed to their pari&s;h wor&s;hip. And late in a winter evening &s;he was &s;eized for it, and carried &s;ome miles; and then, calling at an inn, &s;he was prevailed upon to pay the tax; after which &s;he was left to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eturn home, in the dead of the night, through fro&s;t and &s;now, to her three &s;mall fatherle&s;s children. Al&s;o the widow Mary Corlis, of Haverhill, a member of the Bapti&s;t church there, had one of her cattle taken away for a mini&s;terial tax. "Thus, &s;ays &s;he, I was oppre&s;&s;ed, in a Province where there is an univer&s;al cry for LIBERTY! the cry of the wi|dow and fatherle&s;s they regard not!" So far from it, that further attempts were now made to in|flame the re&s;entment of the ruling party again&s;t all di&s;&s;enters from their wo&s;hip.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A BOOK was publi&s;hed in 1767, and di&s;|per&s;ed through New-England, wherein it was &s;aid of the Bapti&s;t churches in general, "They little think, as I charitably believe, how far they join with the <HI>gates of hell,</HI> in oppo&s;ing the church of
<PB N="245" REF="018336_0260_0FA5D055B15EF638">Chri&s;t, by laying wa&s;te the nur&s;ery, out of which his vineyard is &s;upplied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fi&s;h's nine &s;ermons, p. 95.</NOTE>." As if natural growth could fit children for Chri&s;tian communion; or, that a requiring fruits meet for repentance, in order for admi&s;&s;ion thereto, were a de&s;troying of them. In the &s;ame book were many odious reports concerning the &s;eparations in and after 1744, &s;eve|ral of which were not true in fact; and having in|troduced a plea in favour of tho&s;e people, that they are not &s;uch now, the writer &s;ays, "It is readily granted, that they are now much more moderate and civil than they were in that day, are very peaceable, kind, obliging, good neighbours.&mdash;But what does this rea&s;oning argue? Why it only &s;hows that they have lo&s;t degree of their own <HI>original &s;pirit, as Separates</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE>." And yet he began his preface with &s;aying, "The &s;pecial occa&s;ion of the following di&s;cour&s;es was, the <HI>revival of the &s;pirit</HI> and principles of Separation and Anabapti&s;m." According therefore to his own te&s;timony, they were peaceable, kind, obliging, good neighbours, after that &s;pirit was revived. Neither were his party any more con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves in a fol|lowing publication. For upon the Briti&s;h claims of taxing America, an evident de&s;ign was form|ing to e&s;tabli&s;h Epi&s;copacy therein; to guard again&s;t which, it was &s;aid in 1768, "We are, in principle, again&s;t all civil e&s;tabli&s;hments in reli|gion.&mdash;It does not appear to us, that God has entru&s;ted the State with a right to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments. If the State in England has this delegated authority, mu&s;t it not be owned, that the State in China, in Turky, in Spain, has this authority al&s;o?&mdash;And as they mu&s;t &s;everally be &s;uppo&s;ed to exert this authority in e&s;tabli&s;hments
<PB N="246" REF="018336_0261_0FA5D0570C070290">conformable to their own &s;entiments in religion, what can the con&s;equence be but infinite damage to the cau&s;e of God and true religion?

And this publication appeared of &s;uch importance, to the annual A&s;&s;ociation of mini&s;ters from all parts of Connecticut, in June, 1768, that they pub|li&s;hed a letter of thanks to Dr. Chauncy therefor, in a Bo&s;ton news-paper. Yet, for the&s;e forty years, he has wrote the mo&s;t to uphold their reli|gious e&s;tabli&s;hments in New-England, of any man upon earth. And a &s;till greater demon&s;tration of the pernicious effects thereof is before us.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. A GRANT was made in 1735, to Ebe|nezer Hunt and others, of a town&s;hip &s;ix miles &s;quare, we&s;tward of Deerfield. A plan of it
<PB N="247" REF="018336_0262_0FA5D0572ECB56F0">was to be drawn in &s;ixty-three equal &s;hares; one of which was to be for their fir&s;t mini&s;ter, one for the mini&s;try, and one for the &s;chool; and certain improvements were to be made upon each of the other &s;hares, within three years after the confirma|tion of the plan. They were al&s;o to &s;ettle a learn|ed orthodox mini&s;ter, and to build and fini&s;h a convenient meeting-hou&s;e for public wor&s;hip. By rea&s;on of &s;ucceeding wars, the planting of that place was delayed until 1751. In the mean time a com|plaint was entered to the church in South-Hadly, that one of their members had propagated a re|proachful lie concerning Chileab Smith, a father therein. But the complaint was di&s;regarded, which moved him to enquire into the con&s;titution of the church; and, to his &s;urprize, though the words of their covenant implied a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith, yet he found that &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion was not held to be nece&s;&s;ary in order for their communion. He then laboured to convince the church that this was a dangerous error: and, being invited, he went to a meeting of mini&s;ters at Hatfield, Augu&s;t 6, 1750, and laid before the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many &s;criptural rea&s;ons again&s;t it. But they gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him no &s;atisfaction, only refer|red him to Mr. Edwards, who was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Northampton two months before, for rejecting that principle. Edwards approved of Smith's rea&s;ons again&s;t it, but not of a &s;eparation therefor. But as Smith judged otherwi&s;e, he openly withdrew from &s;aid church; and in 1751 he removed to Hunts|town, with eight children, when there were but two or three families therein. Others came in &s;oon after, and lived without public wor&s;hip for &s;ome time; and then eternal concernments were &s;o clear|ly opened to his mind, that he called the inhabitants together, and prayed with, and expounded the &s;crip|tures
<PB N="248" REF="018336_0263_0FA5D057E1435D98">to them, to &s;uch good purpo&s;e that his chil|dren and many others were hopefully converted. In November, 1753, his elde&s;t &s;on was called to preach the go&s;pel; and, with great hazard and ex|pence, they kept their &s;tation, and maintained pub|lic wor&s;hip, through a bloody Indian war of &s;even years continuance; near the clo&s;e whereof they were led into believers bapti&s;m, and became an organized church on Augu&s;t 20, 1761; by a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from Killingly, Sturbridge, and Stafford; and by the clo&s;e of that year the church increa&s;ed to twenty-four members, half of whom were males.</P>
<P N="2">II. IN 1762, a State tax was impo&s;ed upon that plantation; and as the law exempts all &s;ettled mi|ni&s;ters therefrom, two of their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors allowed their mini&s;ter that privilege. But, for this, the other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or entered a complaint again&s;t them to Springfield Court. The Bapti&s;ts de&s;ired time to prove that their mini&s;ter was regularly ordained; but the Court refu&s;ed it, or to allow of any appeal from their judgment; and extorted a large fine and co&s;ts from them, for not taxing their mini&s;ter con|trary to law. When he was ordained, there were but five families, out of nineteen in the place, again&s;t him; but, the danger of the war being over, others moved in, and in February, 1763, they ordained Mr. Jacob Sherwin over that party; and not only gave him all the privileges of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the town, but al&s;o an Hundred Pounds &s;ettlement and Sixty-four Pounds a year &s;alary, to which they added a large &s;um to build them a meeting-hou&s;e, and taxed the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter and his people with others to pay it. The plantation being only a propriety&s;hip, it was &s;aid the exempt|ing law for Bapti&s;ts did not extend there; and when it was incorporated in 1765, by the name of
<PB N="249" REF="018336_0264_0FA5D058BB32BD48">A&s;hfield, the word <HI>&s;upport</HI> was artfully in&s;erted, which had no place in their original grant, nor in the incorporating acts of the towns of Charlemont and Lane&s;borough, pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion. New taxes were hereupon impo&s;ed upon the Bap|ti&s;ts in A&s;hfield, to &s;upport a mini&s;ter whom they never cho&s;e; but their oppre&s;&s;ors at length found them&s;elves en&s;nared in the work of their own hands. For proprietors and inhabitants are two di&s;tinct bodies of men in law, governed by different rules; the votes of the latter being equal, but of the for|mer according to their intere&s;t; &s;o that the vote of a proprietor, who owns five hundred acres, is equal to ten inhabitants who own but fifty acres a piece; and by their act of incorporation, the power of taxation in A&s;hfield was put into the hands of the inhabitants and proprietors, both of whom could not do it together, nor either of them apart, ac|cording to that act.</P>
<P N="3">III. THIS confu&s;ion afforded &s;ome re&s;pite to the Bapti&s;ts; but hearing of further de&s;igns again&s;t them, they came to the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, of May 25, 1768, with a memorial of their &s;ervices and &s;ufferings in promoting that plantation, and a prayer for a full exemption from taxes to a wor&s;hip that they did not join with. A committee of three was appointed upon it; two of whom brought in a report to grant the petition: But Ed&s;on, their Chair|man, was for giving time to their oppo&s;ites to bring in objections; and to him the A&s;&s;embly hearkened and on May 31 ordered that the clerks of the in|habitants and proprietors of A&s;hfield &s;hould be no|tified of this memorial, that they might bring in objections again&s;t it, on the &s;econd Tue&s;day of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, and that the further collection of taxes from the petitioners &s;hould be
<PB N="250" REF="018336_0265_0FA5D059C3CE3E40">&s;u&s;pended in the mean time. Col. I&s;rael Williams was received a repre&s;entative from Hatfield the next day, who was the mo&s;t re&s;olute judge in fin|ing the A&s;hfield a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in 1762; and before the clo&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion a new act was pa&s;&s;ed which took the power of taxation out of the hands of the inha|bitants of A&s;hfield, three years after the town was incorporated, and impowered the proprietors to im|po&s;e what taxes they judged proper, for the <HI>&s;upport</HI> of their mini&s;ter, as well as other u&s;es; and to lay the &s;ame wholly upon the lands, in who&s;e hands &s;o|ever they might be, which were to be &s;old, if the owners refu&s;ed to pay the tax. This was done un|der the &s;ame influence which has &s;ince involved the nation in blood and confu&s;ion. For in the preceding winter our A&s;&s;embly came into a re&s;olu|tion to write letters to &s;i&s;ter Colonies, to reque&s;t them to unite in the u&s;e of prudent means again&s;t the attempts that were making, to bring America to be taxed where they were not repre&s;ented. On June 30, our Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were re|quired to <HI>re&s;cind</HI> that re&s;olution; which Ed&s;on, Wil|liams, and fifteen more, voted to do; But ninety-two members rejected that arbitrary mandate, one of whom was Captain Benjamin White, a Bapti&s;t, repre&s;entative from Middleborough. For this no|ble &s;tand again&s;t tyranny, that Hou&s;e was di&s;&s;olved, and no other called through the year; &s;o that the Bapti&s;ts could have no hearing, while power was on the &s;ide of their oppre&s;&s;ors, who adverti&s;ed their lands to be &s;old on May 3, 1769. But when they met, &s;uch defects were pointed out in their proceed|ings, that the &s;ale was omitted; and each party came with memorials to the A&s;&s;embly of May 31. Contentions betwixt the Hou&s;e and the Governor &s;erved as an excu&s;e for not hearing the Bapti&s;ts, but
<PB N="251" REF="018336_0266_0FA5D05A56197880">their oppre&s;&s;ors were heard; and on July 5 it was re&s;olved, "That all the votes and tran&s;actions of the &s;aid town of A&s;hfield, in their &s;everal town|meetings, &s;ince their incorporation to this time, be and are hereby ratified and confirmed; any omi&s;|&s;ions or neglect of making due and proper returns on the &s;everal warrants for calling the &s;ame meet|ings, or any of them, notwith&s;tanding." Williams and Leonard (two of the Mandamus Coun&s;ellors in 1774) were of the committee who framed this re|&s;olve, though it was not pa&s;&s;ed into a law. July 15 the A&s;&s;embly was prorogued to January, and in the mean time a new tax was impo&s;ed in A&s;h|field, and the Bapti&s;t lands were adverti&s;ed to be &s;old April 4, 1770. In January they &s;ent to Bo&s;|ton, but the A&s;&s;embly was prorogued to March 15, when they &s;at at Cambridge, but did not re|ceive the Bapti&s;ts petition until the 27th, and it was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed April 4, the day their lands were to be &s;old. Some friends in Bo&s;ton laid the cruel|ty hereof before &s;ome of the members &s;o plainly, that their petition was re&s;umed on April 10; but in&s;tead of then granting any relief, they were only put to more co&s;ts, to notify their oppre&s;&s;ors to bring in objections. On April 4 the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of A&s;hfield met, and &s;old three hundred and ninety-eight acres of the Bapti&s;ts lands to &s;upport the wor|&s;hip of the oppo&s;ite party. For a demand upon the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter of One Pound Two Shillings, they &s;old ten acres of his home-lot. His father had one of the be&s;t orchards in the town, which is of &s;pecial &s;ervice in a new place; yet twenty acres of improved land, containing the main of his or|chard, with a burying-yard, and a &s;mall dwelling-hou&s;e, were &s;truck off to Elijah Wells, for Thirty-five Shillings; who on May 4 came and forcibly
<PB N="252" REF="018336_0267_0FA5D05AEC3B5570">entered upon it, and mea&s;ured it off; and the next day came and pulled up a number of the &s;maller apple-trees, and carried them away, and offered to &s;ell &s;aid hou&s;e. The&s;e facts were proved by a num|ber of witne&s;&s;es before authority, though, to &s;hift off the odium they were expo&s;ed to, by a new &s;ur|vey, they left out the hou&s;e and burying-yard, and then accu&s;ed the Bapti&s;ts of fal&s;hood in the fir&s;t account. But nothing better could be expected, from men who could deal &s;o unju&s;tly, and could laugh at a mock-&s;ermon, delivered by Wells upon that occa&s;ion, which breathed as great cruelty as words could expre&s;s. Repeated applications were made to the Legi&s;lature for help, but in vain; and the Bapti&s;t agent was at la&s;t told plainly, that it was not worth while to wait any longer, for they would keep them under the law by which tho&s;e lands were &s;old, as long as they &s;aw fit. Receiving &s;uch a plain declaration from a member of the A&s;&s;embly, in the pre&s;ence of others, he went and acquaint|ed the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton therewith, who thought proper to publi&s;h an adverti&s;ement to all the Bapti&s;ts in this Province, dated July 31, re|que&s;ting them to bring in exact accounts of their ca&s;es and &s;ufferings to their en&s;uing A&s;&s;ociation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A yearly meeting of their churches, began at Warren, Sep|tember 8, 1767, called <HI>The Warren A&s;&s;ociation.</HI></NOTE>, "Where mea&s;ures will be re&s;olutely adopted, for obtaining redre&s;s from another quarter than that to which repeated application hath been made un|&s;ucce&s;sfully. Nay, complaints, however ju&s;t and grievous, have been treated with indifference, and &s;carcely, if at all, credited." Accounts were ac|cordingly brought to a meeting of fifteen churches at Bellingham, September 11, who unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to apply to the King in Council for relief,
<PB N="253" REF="018336_0268_0FA5D05B9EB4C378">if it could not be obtained here; and they made choice of agents and a committee for the purpo&s;e; and wrote to their &s;outhern brethren for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the de&s;ign. This alarmed &s;ome politicians at Bo&s;ton, who urged the Bapti&s;ts to pre&s;ent an ad|dre&s;s to our Legi&s;lature, and they promi&s;ed to ex|ert their influence in their favour. A memorial was therefore drawn, and was &s;igned in behalf of the Bapti&s;t churches, by their mini&s;ters at Bo&s;ton and Haverhill; wherein the late te&s;timony of our A&s;&s;embly, again&s;t the taxing of people where they are not repre&s;ented, was commended, and this liber|ty was pleaded for in the church, and in particular that the &s;aid A&s;hfield law might be repealed, and their property be re&s;tored; that others who had &s;uf|fered in &s;uch ways might recover damages, and equal religious liberty be allowed to all. Soon af|ter this was received by the A&s;&s;embly at Cambridge, a piece was publi&s;hed from thence, dated Septem|ber 22, 1770, repre&s;enting that the Bapti&s;ts had complained without any ju&s;t rea&s;on at all, and that it would be &s;erviceable to have an authentic ac|count of the A&s;hfield affair publi&s;hed. And, after many great &s;welling words about the charity and lenity of the&s;e times, the writer &s;aid, "It was a&s;to|ni&s;hing to mo&s;t people among us, to hear the news|paper complaints exhibited by the Bapti&s;ts; they could not &s;o much as gue&s;s from whence they could ari&s;e." This was in&s;erted in three or four Bo&s;ton papers. And then, on November 15, the A&s;&s;em|bly gave orders that A&s;hfield proprietors &s;hould be notified to bring in objections again&s;t the fir&s;t pray|er of the Bapti&s;ts memorial, to their next &s;e&s;&s;ion. And their old certificate law being out of date, a new one was framed, which changed their title to Antipedobapti&s;ts, and changed the time of giving
<PB N="254" REF="018336_0269_0FA5D05C701ADD78">in certificates to the fir&s;t of September; which were to be &s;igned by three or more principal members, and the mini&s;ter, if there be any. The word con|gregation was to be u&s;ed in&s;tead of the word church; and the pari&s;hes were empowered to vote the Bap|ti&s;ts clear, if they plea&s;ed, without certificates. But the word con&s;cientiou&s;ly was &s;till retained, and the certificates were required to be given in annu|ally to pari&s;h a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MR. Davis, clerk of their committee, now called them together; and, upon examination, they declared them&s;elves not &s;atisfied with this law, and they advi&s;ed Davis to an&s;wer the Cambridge piece. He did &s;o, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Gazette of De|cember 27, by giving a plain and conci&s;e view of the A&s;hfield affair, and a&s;&s;erting that it was the SOLE cau&s;e of their complaining publicly at this time; and &s;igned him&s;elf, A BAPTIST. But in|&s;tead of any fair reply, a writer appeared in the Bo&s;ton Evening-Po&s;t, of January 7, 1771, &s;aying, "There is a little up&s;tart gentleman, lately &s;et|tled in town, who calls him&s;elf A BAPTIST; and the youth di&s;covers a mo&s;t in&s;ufferable arrogance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency.&mdash;I very much &s;u&s;pect, that he is one of tho&s;e deluded young men, who are em|ployed to defame and blacken the Colonies, and this town and Province in particular.&mdash;I am of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion in religion with this young hero,&mdash; and I cannot &s;ay what the General A&s;&s;embly could do for the Bapti&s;ts in general, or the A&s;hfield bre|thren in particular, that they have not done.&mdash;And I believe this is the opinion of Bapti&s;ts in general, and of all others but enthu&s;ia&s;tical bigots." And he had the impudence to annex to this, and much more of the &s;ame kind, the &s;ignature of A CATHO|LIC BAPTIST. When Mr. Davis came to &s;ee it,
<PB N="255" REF="018336_0270_0FA5D05D2AEC3478">he &s;aid he would never put pen to paper to an&s;wer &s;uch mean and dirty &s;tuff. In the gazette of Fe|bruary 7 came out another piece, from a mini&s;ter near A&s;hfield, &s;uppo&s;ed to be of Deerfield, who &s;aid, "It is a very common ob&s;ervation among us, that the people called &s;eparate Bapti&s;ts in the&s;e parts will not &s;tick at any fal&s;e repre&s;entations to &s;erve their purpo&s;e;" which he attempted to prove by facts. But Elder Smith, of A&s;hfield, came down and an&s;wered him in the &s;ame paper, of March 21, when, from public records, he fairly turned that charge back upon the mini&s;ter who advanced it.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;embly met at Cambridge &s;ix days after, to whom was exhibited &s;o large a bundle of rea&s;ons again&s;t their granting the fir&s;t prayer of the Bapti&s;ts memorial, as co&s;t them Twenty Shillings to get a copy of it from the Secretary, it being twelve pages in folio. And yet there was no attempt in it to prove that the word &s;upport was in the original grant of A&s;hfield, nor other points that were truly to the purpo&s;e. Two pa&s;&s;ages in it may give a proper idea of the whole performance. They &s;ay, "<HI>Natural rights</HI> are in this Province wholly &s;uper|ceded in this ca&s;e by civil obligation, and in mat|ters of taxation, individuals cannno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the lea&s;t propriety plead <HI>them.</HI>" Exactly the doctrine of the Briti&s;h Court at this time; but which never could be carried into effect at any time without covering it with religious pretences; therefore, they went on to flatter our rulers in that re&s;pect, and to &s;ay of the Bapti&s;ts, "Some have had the effrontery to &s;ay, that the &s;tanding mini&s;try is corrupt, mini&s;ters them&s;elves unconverted, the churches impure and unholy, admitting uncon|verted and <HI>un&s;anctified</HI> per&s;ons into their commu|nion." As if it were a very uncharitable and dar|ing
<PB N="256" REF="018336_0271_0FA5D05E12727920">thing, for any not to look upon them to be a <HI>&s;anctified</HI> people, when they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to profe&s;s them&s;elves to be &s;uch! For our excellent Edwards was rejected by that county with much heat and bitterne&s;s, only for his in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion from communicants. We had direct intelligence that this piece was drawn in Judge Williams's family, and it was &s;igned in the name of the proprietors of A&s;hfield, by Jonathan Taylor, Timothy Lewis, Samuel Belding, Ben|jamin Phillips, Philip Phillips. The three lat|ter were the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors who &s;old &s;aid lands, and the la&s;t of them was the man who got his brother a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors fined in 1762, for not taxing their mini&s;ter contrary to law. The Council and Hou&s;e joined in a committee upon &s;aid memorial; and they &s;ay in their report, </P>

<P N="5">V. ACCORDINGLY, on April 24, the Council voted to di&s;mi&s;s it. And though the Hou&s;e was alarmed, and did not concur with this, but pro|po&s;ed to have a bill brought in to repeal the A&s;h|field law, yet their propo&s;al was rejected, and the
<PB N="257" REF="018336_0272_0FA5D05E9BE80330">petition with it. And what a cloud was hereby brought over an oppre&s;&s;ed people! On the &s;ide of the oppre&s;&s;ors was power, bu they &s;eemed to have no helper. But, behold! in a Bo&s;ton paper of Oc|tober 21, it was declared that the King in Council had di&s;annulled that law. What a &s;urprize did this occa&s;ion! How could &s;o de&s;picable a people get acce&s;s to the throne, and obtain &s;uch an act, e&s;pe|cially in &s;o &s;hort a time! However it was &s;oon &s;aid, that there was a man in Hatfield that would hin|der the Bapti&s;ts from reaping any advantage there|by. This was a my&s;tery, till it was explained on November 8, when two officers, with a numerous aid, came to old Mr. Smith's hou&s;e before he was up in the morning, with a warrant from Judge Wil|liams to &s;eize his per&s;on, and to &s;earch his hou&s;e and &s;hop for bad money. Smith readily promi&s;ed the u&s;e of his keys, and de&s;ired that no lock might be broken, and al&s;o that he might have liberty to pray with his family before he was carried off. Li|berty for prayer was granted by one officer, but in the mean time the other broke the lock of his &s;hop, and damaged his goods there, and afterwards in his hou&s;e; and then he was carried before a Court at Judge Williams's, where he was compelled to &s;tand till ten witne&s;&s;es were examined; from whom no evidence could be obtained again&s;t him, "Nor any circum&s;tance tending to prove the indictment," as &s;even of them gave from under their hands a few days after. Yet Mr. Smith was held a pri&s;oner through the night, in a cold room, and denied either bed or fire, to the great injury of his body, being above 60 years old, and infirm before. In the morning Judge Williams in&s;inuated &s;everal things again&s;t him, without &s;uffering him to make any an&s;wer, and bound him over to their next Superior
<PB N="258" REF="018336_0273_0FA5D05FA9ACBF38">Court, in large bonds with &s;ureties. Like warrants were i&s;&s;ued, it was &s;aid, again&s;t their pa&s;tor, who then happened to be ab&s;ent on a journey. Reports were therefore indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread in the country, that notwith&s;tanding all their talk, tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts were a parcel of money-makers, and their mini&s;ter was gone to &s;catter it, and would never dare to re|turn. But herein they were &s;oon found liars, and though the country was ran&s;acked in the &s;pring for witne&s;&s;es again&s;t his father, yet they all failed them. At la&s;t a man was brought near thirty miles for the purpo&s;e, who te&s;tified to the Court at Northamp|ton, that he &s;hould not know the man if he met him in the room. So he was di&s;charged, and the law was open for him to &s;ue for damages for this malicious pro&s;ecution. But, lo! a bankrupt, &s;on to the mini&s;ter of Sunderland, had been brought over the river to enter the complaint again&s;t him, &s;o that he might never obtain any recompence in this world. Yet God often takes the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">VI. WHEN &s;uch noi&s;e was made at Bo&s;ton about the A&s;hfield affair, Governor Hutchin&s;on happen|ed to look and find that the word &s;upport was not in the original grant of tho&s;e lands; and perhaps he might hope, that by relieving the Bapti&s;ts, he &s;hould draw them to his &s;ide of the controver&s;y betwixt America and Britain. Be that as it may, he privately &s;ent for one of their committee, and advi&s;ed him to &s;end the A&s;hfield law to a friend in London, who might pre&s;ent it to the King in Coun|cil; and he promi&s;ed to write to Governor Ber|nard, who pa&s;&s;ed it, to u&s;e his influence to have it repealed. This was done, and its repeal was ef|fected, and then their oppre&s;&s;ors had their turn at waiting upon one A&s;&s;embly after another un&s;uc|ce&s;sfully;
<PB N="259" REF="018336_0274_0FA5D0612A6E4A18">for though &s;everal acts were framed for them, yet the con&s;ent of the Governor could not be obtained, till they found out what his mind was, and conformed to it. In January, 1773, the A&s;|&s;embly appointed a committee, out of their mem|bers, to go up to A&s;hfield, and to hear both parties, and then to make a tax to pay all that they judged to be behind concerning Mr. Sherwin's &s;ettlement and meeting-hou&s;e, and the charges which had aro&s;e about the &s;ame; and what they judged any of the Bapti&s;ts had paid more than this &s;hould be re|funded to them, and for the future they &s;hould &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing with their brethren el&s;ewhere. The doings of that committee were confirmed by a &s;ub&s;equent act in February, 1774, and the &s;mall tax which was laid upon &s;ome of the Bapti&s;ts they paid, and by this time their oppre&s;&s;ors were &s;ick of their own mini&s;ter, and he was di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed from his office, &s;o that they lo&s;t the right in the town which they took &s;o much pains to wre&s;t from Elder Smith, be&s;ides the other un&s;peakable evils and &s;candals which &s;prang from thence.</P>
<P N="7">VII. THIS account is carefully taken from our printed laws, journals of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, and other writings and te&s;timonies; and our opponents are welcome to point out any mi&s;takes therein, if they can. A gentleman of great influ|ence in our Legi&s;lature informed me, that it was a&s;|&s;erted in the A&s;&s;embly, that tho&s;e petitioners acted with the re&s;t in &s;ettling Mr. Sherwin, but now want|ed to &s;lip out their necks, and leave an intolerable burthen upon their neighbours, which &s;tory had great influence to hinder the granting of any relief to the Bapti&s;ts. Whereas, if they had been informed of it, they would have demon&s;trated that this &s;tory was
<PB N="260" REF="018336_0275_0FA5D061E9541400">a glaring fal&s;hood, as al&s;o was the report of the com|mittee whereof Brattle was Chairman; for Wells, who bought Smith's lot, &s;ued him for cutting the gra&s;s upon it in Augu&s;t, 1770, and upon trial in the winter, the Court turned the ca&s;e again&s;t Wells, be|cau&s;e the &s;ale was <HI>not legal,</HI> two months before Brat|tle reported that it was <HI>quite legal.</HI> And &s;aid law being repealed, all tho&s;e &s;ales of lands fell of cour&s;e. And who can de&s;cribe all their guilt in tho&s;e tran&s;|actions! If it had been right to tax the Bapti&s;ts to Sherwin's &s;ettlement and meeting-hou&s;e, taxes of &s;ix times the value of his &s;ettlement had been laid upon them, before the law was made to &s;ell their lands for his &s;upport; yet, for three years after, their oppre&s;&s;ors a&s;&s;erted with brazen Impudence, that tho&s;e taxes were only to fulfil the original con|dition of their grant. But according to what our delegates to Congre&s;s a&s;&s;erted in Philadelphia, Oc|tober 14, 177<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before many witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ettling of Elder Smith in A&s;hfield in 1761 fulfilled that condition, and the denying of him the privileges of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the town was a violation of the faith of government; for which, as well as for their great trouble and expences, cau&s;ed by &s;ub&s;e|quent acts, they have received no recompence.</P>
<P>BECAUSE Governor Hutchin&s;on procured relief to that &s;ociety, &s;ome have blamed the Bapti&s;ts for not adhering to him and his party in the general conte&s;t betwixt Britain and America; but they had good rea&s;ons again&s;t it then, and have greater &s;ince. For many copies of his letters have been found among us, one of which is dated from Bo&s;ton, January 23, 1771, directed to Governor Bernard, wherein Hutchin&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his earne&s;t de&s;ire that Ca&s;tle William might not again be put under the

And after further urg|ing to inflammatory mea&s;ures, he &s;ays, "The Bap|ti&s;ts have made a little &s;tir, and complain of being oppre&s;&s;ed; but in general they have all the liberty which can con&s;i&s;t with a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment for maintaining public wor&s;hip, without which we &s;hould be wor&s;e than we are. No Bapti&s;t in prin|ciple is obliged to pay to mini&s;ters upon the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. All who attend a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter are not exempt; if they &s;hould be, the congregations would be broke to pieces in all parts of the Pro|vince." He then gave rea&s;ons why the A&s;hfield law ought to be repealed, and &s;aid to Bernard, "I &s;uppo&s;e you would not have pa&s;&s;ed it, if you had con&s;idered the force of the word <HI>&s;upport,</HI> and that it militated with the general law in favour of Bapti&s;ts. I have no doubt it was artfully &s;lipt in by one of the Hamp&s;hire repre&s;entatives." Equal religious li|berty, therefore, was far from his de&s;ign, though he appeared for their help in that ca&s;e. And the art|ful repre&s;entative referred to was, for being one of the &s;eventeen <HI>re&s;cinders,</HI> &s;et up as Chief Judge of their County Court; in which office he oppre&s;&s;ed other Bapti&s;ts in the following manner.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. THEY formed a regular church in Mon|tague, July 1, 1765; and gave certificates to pa|ri&s;h a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors according to law; yet they were taxed to other wor&s;hip, and di&s;tre&s;s was made therefor. Several attempts were made in pari&s;h meetings to have this di&s;order rectified, but in vain, therefore
<PB N="262" REF="018336_0277_0FA5D063252E2488">Samuel Harvey &s;ued Montague a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors for a cow and calf, that had been taken from him for a tax to their mini&s;ter. After the writ was &s;erved, a pari&s;h meeting was called, who voted to &s;tand by their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and &s;aid they meant to try the merits of the cau&s;e, whether the&s;e were the Bapti&s;ts whom the law exempted or not. When Judge Williams came to deliver the ca&s;e to the jury, he did not call that point in que&s;tion, yet he &s;aid, "The law &s;ays the certificate &s;hall be &s;igned by three principal members of the Bapti&s;t church, and the plaintiff is one of the &s;igners, and he cannot certify for him&s;elf, therefore there are but two, and the law &s;ays there &s;hall be three." To him the jury hearkened, and turned the ca&s;e again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, in Augu&s;t, 1769. They appealed to the Superior Court the next month; but the action was continued till September, 1770, when the ca&s;e was called, and the witne&s;&s;es appeared; but becau&s;e they were Bapti&s;ts, they were not ad|mitted, and the ca&s;e was again put off, and the Bapti&s;ts were required to pay half the jury's fees. At la&s;t, on May 1, 1771, a trial was brought on, when Judge Oliver and others turned the ca&s;e again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, upon the &s;ame point as Wil|liams had before done. Upon which it is to be remarked, that before 1752, their laws required but two &s;igners to a certificate; and the law they now acted upon allowed of no more than three, where there was not a mini&s;ter, as was the ca&s;e at Montague; and the &s;igners could not have been exempted, if their names had not been in the li&s;t. Yet becau&s;e they were &s;trained upon, and not others, the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t them, without trying the merits of the cau&s;e, as was promi&s;ed; and after the expence of above an Hundred Dol|lars,
<PB N="263" REF="018336_0278_0FA5D064B08CD928">the Bapti&s;ts were left without any hope of re|medy from our Courts. And, to worry them out, di&s;tre&s;s was again made upon their committee, and not others. A yoke of oxen was taken from Harvey, a cow from Sawyer, and Major Richard Montague was &s;eized and carried &s;ix miles toward the pri&s;on, kept all night, and then relea&s;ed, and the officer went back and took a &s;wine that he was fatting for his family. O how dark was this cloud over that little flock! Yet one of them &s;aid to his brethren, "Who knows but that God will bring good out of this evil? though we are &s;tript of our &s;ub&s;tance, yet unborn ages may prai&s;e him for this." Yea, they them&s;elves have lived to &s;ee &s;ome happy fruits of their &s;ufferings. One thing which gave a check to oppre&s;&s;ion, was a determi|nation of authority, that the mini&s;ters of Bapti&s;t churches were lawful mini&s;ters, &s;o as to have a right to marry people, and to be exempted from civil taxes. This was determined by the Superi|or Court, in one trial at Worce&s;ter, and another in Hamp&s;hire; the la&s;t of which was this year.</P>
<P N="9">IX. NONE of their opponents appeared willing to relea&s;e them, till they had tried the matter, and were taught the folly of oppre&s;&s;ion by experience. If we turn our eyes from the we&s;t to the ea&s;t, we &s;hall &s;ee further evidence of this. By a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Haverhill, a Bapti&s;t church was regularly con&s;tituted at Berwick, in the county of York, June 28, 1768. Mr. Jo&s;hua Emery was their teacher, though not or|dained. They gave certificates according to law, yet were all taxed to other mini&s;ters; and John Gowen was impri&s;oned therefor in December, 1769. The like was done to Mr. Emery the next month; and he &s;ued for recompence in both ca&s;es, but they were delayed till July, 1770, when Emery a&s;ked for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="264" REF="018336_0279_0FA5D065AB50AB38">&s;ummons to bring the collector with his warrant. The Judge ordered the clerk to give one, to bring the collector with his original li&s;t. He came with it, but not the warrant, and the Council for the de|fendants &s;aid there could be no trial without the warrant; and the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t Emery. He appealed to the Superior Court, where the col|lector was brought with his warrant; but then he &s;wore that he did not take Emery as a pri&s;oner. Emery told the Court, that he did take him and carry him to York, and held him as a pri&s;oner thirty hours, and reque&s;ted him to prove it, either now or at the next term. This was denied him, and judg|ment was given again&s;t him. With difficulty he ob|tained a continuance of his friend's ca&s;e; and the pari&s;h committee promi&s;ed to let the Bapti&s;ts alone till that ca&s;e was tried. Yet in a few days another tax was impo&s;ed and demanded. Upon this a com|plaint was entered to authority again&s;t the former collector for fal&s;e-&s;wearing, and he was bound over to Court upon it; but he repeatedly &s;aid, he hoped the day of death would come before that day of trial. And behold! he died &s;uddenly ju&s;t before the Court! Yet this did not hinder the next collec|tor from coming and &s;eizing Mr. Emery's hor&s;e, while he was vi&s;iting a &s;ick per&s;on. The pari&s;h a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were &s;ued therefor in January, 1771, and though they tried a number of crooked ways to delay the matter, and to defeat the de&s;ign, yet both this and his friend's ca&s;e, that was continued, were finally turned again&s;t the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. John Emery, of York, joined to &s;aid &s;ociety, and got the &s;ame certified to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the pari&s;h where he lived; yet he was taxed to their wor&s;hip, and when he was from home, a collector came and &s;eized his pewter therefor. But experience has &s;ince taught their
<PB N="265" REF="018336_0280_0FA5D0663359A140">oppre&s;&s;ors to cea&s;e from &s;uch violence. This ac|count is carefully taken from authentic vouchers now in my hands.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. A SMALL Bapti&s;t church at Newton, in the &s;outh borders of New-Hamp&s;hire, form|ed out of a Separate &s;ociety there in 1755, was the only church of that denomination in that Province, before 1770. In and after the year 1764 many were hopefully converted in &s;everal parts of it; where believers bapti&s;m has &s;ince been introduced in the following manner. About the year 1720 one Scammon, of Stratham, on Pi&s;cataqua river, married Rachel Thurber, from Rehoboth, who was a firm believer of the Bapti&s;t principles; but
<PB N="266" REF="018336_0281_0FA5D06A349DC9A0">the country round her was &s;o full of prejudices again&s;t them, that in forty years &s;he could gain no more than one per&s;on to join with her therein; and that was a pious woman in the neighbourhood, who travelled fifty-five miles to Bo&s;ton, and was bap|tized by Elder Bound. But Mrs. Scammon had &s;uch a de&s;ire to have others enlightened, that hav|ing obtained Norcott's plain di&s;cour&s;e upon bap|ti&s;m, &s;he carried it to Bo&s;ton, with a de&s;ign to get it re-printed upon her own co&s;t; though when &s;he came to &s;peak to a printer about it, he informed her that he had then one hundred and ten copies of that book on hand: Whereupon &s;he purcha&s;ed them all, and came home and gave them away to her ac|quaintance, and to any people who would accept of them; by which means they were &s;cattered through the country, and among poor people in new plan|tations. And &s;he would often &s;ay to her pious neigh|bours, that &s;he was fully per&s;uaded, that a church of Chri&s;tian Bapti&s;ts would be formed in Stratham, though &s;he might not live to &s;ee it. This came to pa&s;s &s;oon after her death, and the like in other places, by the following means. One Samuel Shepard, born at Sali&s;bury, near Newbury, in 1739, was brought to the knowledge of internal religion when very young; and he learned the art of phy&s;ic, and &s;ettled in the practice of it in Nottingham, near Pi&s;cata|qua river. He had no knowledge of Mrs. Scam|mon, nor of any other Bapti&s;ts, till he happened to &s;ee, in a hou&s;e that he vi&s;ited, one of Norcott's books; and upon reading it, there appeared &s;uch a fair examination of the &s;criptures therein, as &s;truck his mind with conviction that believers bapti&s;m was the truth. But it being a principle hardly named among his acquaintance, the conviction went off for &s;ome years. In the mean time, as Mr. Ebenezer
<PB N="267" REF="018336_0282_0FA5D06BAF6076B8">Jones, a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, travelled through Stra|tham, he preached a lecture, which was the means of the conver&s;ion of a young man named Eliphaleth Smith, who was afterwards called to preach the go&s;pel; and in January, 1770, was ordained the pa&s;tor of a Congregational church in a part of Not|tingham called Deerfield. In May following, as he was preaching to his people upon the obliga|tion that all who love Chri&s;t are under to keep his commandments, the command to believe and be baptized was opened with peculiar clearne&s;s to the preacher's mind; upon which he immediately found &s;uch a want of any warrant for bringing their in|fants, as cau&s;ed him to pa&s;s it over in his &s;ermon; and put him and mo&s;t of his church upon &s;uch an examination of that matter, as convinced them that they had not been rightly baptized.</P>
<P N="2">II. BEFORE this, Mr. Shepard, by hearing about Elder Smith of Haverhill, was brought again to think of what he had read in Norcott's book, and to &s;earch the &s;criptures concerning bapti&s;m, and was thereby convinced that the arguments for in|fant bapti&s;m were groundle&s;s, and was made wil|ling to become a Bapti&s;t. Hereupon he improved opportunities of di&s;cour&s;ing upon the &s;ubject with Chri&s;tians of his acquaintance, which was large; enquiring whether he and they might not have been heretofore mi&s;taken about the &s;ubjects and manner of bapti&s;m? Many were hereby put upon &s;earch|ing into the matter, which i&s;&s;ued in a turn of mind to believers bapti&s;m. And Mr. Hezekiah Smith was &s;ent for to Deerfield, where, on June 14, 1770, he baptized their mini&s;ter and thirteen others; and within &s;even days he baptized twenty|four more, who belonged chiefly to Nottingham, Brentwood, and Stratham; and among tho&s;e thir|ty-eight
<PB N="268" REF="018336_0283_0FA5D06D2AC4CAA0">per&s;ons were a Congregational mini&s;ter and two deacons, with Mr. Shepard; who by &s;pecial teaching was brought freely to begin the great work of preaching the go&s;pel on July 8, 1770. And he &s;oon had &s;ome evident &s;eals of his mini&s;try. Mr. Smith, of Deerfield, with the mo&s;t of his church, were united and e&s;tabli&s;hed as pa&s;tor and flock in the Bapti&s;t order. Churches in that or|der were al&s;o formed in Stratham, Brentwood, and Nottingham; who all united in calling Mr. Shep|ard to receive ordination, and for the pre&s;ent to take the pa&s;toral care of them. He was according|ly ordained at Stratham, September 25, 1771; and the ordination &s;ermon, preached by Mr. Still|man, of Bo&s;ton, was printed, together with the charge, by Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, and the right hand of fellow&s;hip by Pre&s;ident Manning, of Providence; and their principles have now had a very exten&s;ive &s;pread in tho&s;e parts. Thus Mrs. Scammon's bread, ca&s;t upon the water, &s;eems to have been found after many days; the books that &s;he freely di&s;per&s;ed being picked up, and made u&s;eful to many. Neither did the writings of learn|ed mini&s;ters, again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, weaken their cau&s;e, but &s;trengthen it, as what follows will &s;hew.</P>
<P N="3">III. MR. Mo&s;es Mather, of Stamford, in his fir&s;t piece upon the covenant, publi&s;hed in 1769, owns ingeniou&s;ly, that the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion, in Gen. xvii. was not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the covenant of grace, but a divine in&s;titution, whereby that nation was taken into vi&s;ible cove|nant with God; and that the ordinances of that church were appointed as means for the regenera|tion as well as comfort and &s;trengthening of its members. And he labours hard to prove that the covenant is the &s;ame with the Chri&s;tian church;
<PB N="269" REF="018336_0284_0FA5D06D9F8F4110">and that the Lord's &s;upper is "A converting or|dinance." And to tho&s;e who hold that per&s;ons ought to profe&s;s &s;aving faith, in order to come to full communion, he &s;ays, "This &s;cheme makes infant bapti&s;m a mere nullity, or thing of naught. To me this conclu&s;ion appears ju&s;t and unavoid|able<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said di&s;cour&s;e, p 17, 54, 57.</NOTE>." Mr. Ebenezer Farris, of Stamford, was rou&s;ed hereby to &s;uch an examination of the &s;ub|ject, as not only brought him to embrace believers bapti&s;m, but al&s;o to publi&s;h a defence of that doc|trine at New-York. And he and others called El|der Gano from thence to baptize them in 1770; and in 1773 a Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted at Stamford, and another at Greenwich, ten miles nearer to New-York. At the &s;ame time, the increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;ts in Bo&s;ton (above &s;ixty members being added to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there) cau&s;ed a great unea&s;ine&s;s among other mini&s;ters, and Dr. Chauncy publi&s;hed five &s;ermons in 1772, to per&s;uade people that it was their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to come up to full communion in their churches. And after labour|ing hard to remove their objections again&s;t coming, e&s;pecially becau&s;e of fears that they were not born again, he &s;ays, "The divinely appointed way, in which per&s;ons become members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in order to their being &s;o, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of <HI>&s;aving faith, or judged to be &s;o.</HI> The children of tho&s;e who are members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church are, by the con&s;titution of God, from their fir&s;t coming into exi&s;tence, members of his kingdom in common with their parents. So it was under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation; and &s;o it is now, if there is any validity in one of the principal argu|ments, by which we vindicate our practice, in bap|tizing
<PB N="270" REF="018336_0285_0FA5D06E6B7A2C38">the infants of tho&s;e who are members of Chri&s;t's church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;ermons on breaking of bread, p. 106, 107.</NOTE>." The con&s;equence indeed ap|pears clear, that if there is any validity in their main argument for infant bapti&s;m, their want of re|generation ought not to keep them back from the other ordinance: But then this is directly again&s;t the te&s;timony for the purity of their churches, which this author produced in 1743, p. 153.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE di&s;po&s;ition of that party is further di&s;|covered by another publication at this time. A Convention of their mini&s;ters at Bri&s;tol, May 20, 1772, agreed to publi&s;h a di&s;cour&s;e, intituled, <HI>Ca|tholici&s;m; or, Chri&s;tian Charity:</HI> And it was printed this year at Providence. Many excellent things are in&s;erted therein, about charity and a catholic di&s;po&s;ition and behaviour, and fal&s;e pretences there|to are well expo&s;ed, e&s;pecially in the following pa&s;|&s;age. Say they, "Liberty and candour are the great ba&s;is of human happine&s;s. We often hear per&s;ons extolling the advantages of both, who yet &s;eem to be really acquainted with neither. For if they have any de&s;ign on foot, any end to an&s;wer, or purpo&s;e to carry into execution, if you entertain different views, and with freedom &s;peak your mind, you are in&s;tantly deemed an enemy, and you mu&s;t be treat|ed as &s;uch; &s;o that if you e&s;cape without the &s;word, it is not &s;o much owing to a generous &s;pirit of li|berty, as a want of power. To &s;upply the defect of their power, your reputation mu&s;t be bla&s;ted, your influence weakened, and your intere&s;t injur|ed. Such liberty de&s;erves no better name than ty|ranny, and &s;uch freedom the ba&s;e&s;t &s;lavery<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Catholici&s;m, p. 65.</NOTE>." The truth of this &s;entence is readily allowed; but to whom is it applicable? Tho&s;e mini&s;ters evidently
<PB N="271" REF="018336_0286_0FA5D06F28598378">intended it again&s;t &s;uch as refu&s;ed communion with their churches. They name the people who began to &s;eparate therefrom about the year 1744, and re|pre&s;ent them as being furious then again&s;t <HI>giving</HI> and <HI>receiving</HI> mini&s;terial &s;upport; but as now being &s;o <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> and <HI>di&s;hone&s;t</HI> as to come into the &s;ame practice them&s;elves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 37, 38.</NOTE> Had they &s;aid a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and forcing, in&s;tead of giving and receiving, they would have di&s;covered a regard to truth and con&s;i&s;tency that is now wanting in their performance. At this time they cen&s;ure tho&s;e as very unrea&s;onable men, who hold immer&s;ion to be e&s;&s;ential to bap|ti&s;m<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 64.</NOTE> And, &s;peaking of a&s;king mini&s;ters to preach occa&s;ionally, the writer &s;ays, "I cannot &s;ee the propriety nor expediency of inviting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any man, be his profe&s;&s;ion what it may, that de|nies ME the rights and privileges of the church of Chri&s;t.&mdash;If WE cannot eat and drink of one bread and one cup, in token of mutual fellow&s;hip, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why I &s;hould encourage &s;uch per&s;ons in their uncharitablene&s;s." Is not this the charity they had before condemned, which begins and ends <HI>in &s;elf</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Page 25, 66.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>IN October, 1770, an act of their Legi&s;lature was obtained, to incorporate a number of men in Pro|vidence into a &s;ociety, by the name of <HI>The Benevo|lent Congregational Society in the town of Providence,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing and managing a fund, to &s;upport public wor&s;hip in the fir&s;t church of that de|nomination there. This was the fir&s;t act of that nature ever pa&s;&s;ed in that Colony; and it was pub|li&s;hed in a pamphlet the next year; in the introduc|tion to which they recite their law again&s;t the u&s;e of force to &s;upport mini&s;ters (&s;ee p. 48) and &s;ay upon it, "Although this act was wi&s;ely intended, yet it was followed with great inconvenience in tho&s;e &s;o|cieties
<PB N="272" REF="018336_0287_0FA5D06FF5B01C30">where the &s;upport of the mini&s;ter was thought to be a duty incumbent on the people, as thereby the burthen of the expence thereof was borne by very few per&s;ons. The Congregational &s;ociety afore|&s;aid has had a large &s;hare of this difficulty." And could they have had their de&s;ire, they would, un|doubtedly, have introduced tax and compul&s;ion for their &s;upport. But as the college in the town was formed upon another plan, &s;aid mini&s;ters refu&s;ed to encourage it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the fir&s;t cla&s;s of graduates in that college was or|dained at Warren July 3, 1771, who has &s;ince been a great ble&s;&s;ing in tho&s;e parts. Others al&s;o were very &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;o that in the years 1771 and 1772, about 230 per&s;ons were baptized, in the adjoining towns of Warren, Swanzey, Rehoboth and Dighton. And Pre&s;ident Manning being called to preach and admini&s;ter ordinances to the Bapti&s;t church in Providence, cau&s;ed a great turn in their affairs; and ill treatment from others was made to work for their good.</NOTE> And though its charter, granted by their Legi&s;lature, explicitly exempts the per&s;ons and e&s;tates of the Pre&s;ident and Profe&s;&s;ors of the college "From all taxes," yet the vote of a town-meeting in Providence was procured in Augu&s;t, 1772, to limit the meaning of tho&s;e words to Colo|ny taxes only. And becau&s;e the Bapti&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in 1773 left &s;aid officers out of their town tax, a town-meeting was called, February 7, 1774, who cen&s;ured tho&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors therefor, and publi&s;hed their re&s;olves in the gazette again&s;t extending that law to town taxes. It is hoped that many who were active in that affair are now convinced of their er|ror, and are &s;en&s;ible that they did not then &s;hew the regard they ought to have done both to liberty and learning. Their honorable exertions in this cau&s;e &s;ince are freely acknowledged; and the&s;e facts are only mentioned to remove the ill effects of tho&s;e publications, and to guard again&s;t &s;uch evils for the future.</P>

V. FOR the &s;ame end I &s;hall give a conci&s;e view of another controver&s;y at this time. A mini&s;ter at Bolton, in Worce&s;ter county, after being intem|perate at other times, drank to exce&s;s on a &s;acra|mental &s;ea&s;on, &s;o as to &s;hock the whole congre|gation. But when his church called him to ac|count therefor, he at fir&s;t denied the crime, and then confe&s;&s;ed it; yet he violated his promi&s;e about offering &s;atisfaction to the congregation. Three Councils were called, who were all for continuing him in office there. But as he had a&s;&s;umed the power to negative the acts of the church, even when dealing with him, and to di&s;&s;olve their meeting without their con&s;ent, they called a meeting them|&s;elves, and cho&s;e a moderator and clerk, and made &s;ome propo&s;als to their mini&s;ter, and adjourned. But as he gave them no &s;atisfaction, they, at their &s;econd adjournment, Augu&s;t 8, 1771, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from his office, and from their communion; and the town concurred therewith. This alarmed many others, who exerted all their influence to prevent the &s;ettlement of another mini&s;ter there in tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances. Mr. Zubdiel Adams publi&s;hed a &s;er|mon again&s;t it in 1772, which was an&s;wered by one who &s;tiles him&s;elf A Neighbour; and each wrote again upon the &s;ubject in 1773. Two editions of Mr. Wi&s;e's works were al&s;o now publi&s;hed; on the other hand a pamphlet came out, &s;aid in the title page to be publi&s;hed <HI>by the Convention of the mini|&s;ters of the Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, at their annual meeting in Bo&s;ton, May</HI> 26, 1773; the whole labour of which is to prove, that a church has not a right to di&s;mi&s;s their mini&s;ter contrary to his con&s;ent, or to the direction of others, where a Council of them can be had. For this end, they in&s;ert a pa&s;&s;age from Cambridge platform, which
<PB N="274" REF="018336_0289_0FA5D07169CDA130">&s;ays, "In ca&s;e an elder offend incorrigably, the matter &s;o requiring, as the church had power to call to office, &s;o they have power, according to order (the Council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to remove him from office." Now it is a known rule in grammar, that though a parenthe&s;is is u&s;eful in its place, yet that the &s;en&s;e is good without it. So are Councils u&s;eful in difficult ca&s;es, if they hold up true light; but it is a violation of &s;aid rule, to make the direc|tion of a Council e&s;&s;ential to the churches act in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing their mini&s;ter. Another authority pro|duced by this Convention is a pa&s;&s;age from Mr. Hooker, which declares for the u&s;e of Councils, and for the right of churches to withdraw their communion from an erroneous church, <HI>that will not be reclaimed.</HI> This will not be denied; but the que&s;tion in hand was, where the power of doing it lies? Whether in the body of each church, or in a collection of officers above them? To confute the latter, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the former of the&s;e points, was the main de&s;ign of Hooker in that book; of which I have given plain proofs (p. 40) and am ready to advance more if nece&s;&s;ary. Directly after their pamphlet came out, a Council of &s;even church|es, viz. four from Bo&s;ton, one from Cambridge, one from Roxbury, and one from Dedham, met at Bol|ton, Augu&s;t 3, at the call of &s;aid depo&s;ed mini&s;ter and his party. And, in their printed re&s;ult, they have given it as their opinion, that the act of the church in depo&s;ing of him ought be looked upon as a <HI>nullity,</HI> becau&s;e it had neither his con&s;ent, nor the direction of a Council of others, where it might have been had. They al&s;o deny its being the act of the majority of all the male members of Bolton church; which la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion was &s;oon after proved not to be
<PB N="275" REF="018336_0290_0FA5D0724DEBCC08">true in fact. In another publication he is introduced, &s;aying, "I have three times been tried by my <HI>peers,</HI> and &s;o far acquitted, that but little blame hath been ca&s;t upon me." And his advocate &s;ays of him, "Having never been condemned by the lawful judgment of his <HI>peers,</HI> and being &s;till their mini&s;ter in the eye of the con&s;titution, he is ju&s;tly intitled to the <HI>&s;upport</HI> they a fir&s;t contracted to give him; neither is it in the <HI>power</HI> of his people to withhold it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adams's reply to the Neighbour, p. 13, 52.</NOTE>." Which is making them <HI>lords</HI> over God's he|ritage, in&s;tead of being examples to the flock. Yea, it is claiming &s;uch a power in the church, as the Briti&s;h Court, even at this time, denied in the State. For the Governor and Council of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a Court of Appeal, finally to decide executive matters; and Governor Hutchin|&s;on claimed a negative power in this, as well as in his legi&s;lative capacity. But as the que&s;tion con|cerning it was referred to the King in Council, it was determined again&s;t the Governor, that he &s;hould not have a negative power in that Executive Court; which determination he was obliged to publi&s;h in Bo&s;ton in January, 1774. And it is mo&s;t certain, that the Chri&s;tian church is only an executive ju|dicature; yet tho&s;e mini&s;ters were now contending for a negative power therein.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AND though the Bapti&s;ts had no hand in the Bolton controver&s;y, yet it &s;erves more clearly to ju&s;tify their oppo&s;ition to &s;uch claims of power at this time. A leader therein was Mr. John Davis, &s;on to a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in the Delaware State, and educated at the college in Philadelphia. He came to Bo&s;ton in May, 1770, and was ordained pa&s;tor of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church there the 9th of September following. He was one of the committee who &s;igned
<PB N="276" REF="018336_0291_0FA5D073CB1B4EB8">the addre&s;s of the Bapti&s;t churches to our Legi&s;la|ture the next month; but perceiving &s;oon after that our charter gave them no right to &s;upport any re|ligious wor&s;hip by tax and compul&s;ion, he plain|ly declared it to men of note; which was the chief cau&s;e of the mean and &s;currilous treatment from the pre&s;s, that he met with the next winter. General Brattle, when acting as Chairman of the committee of the Legi&s;lature in the &s;pring, treated him in like manner; but when he had done, Davis aro&s;e, and di&s;tinctly an&s;wered his arguments, without taking any notice of the per&s;onal abu&s;e that was offered him. A gentleman pre&s;ent &s;aid, the worth of the man never appeared &s;o great before. September 10, 1771, the Warren A&s;&s;ociation made choice of him as their agent, to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours, by the advice of their committee, in concert with their agents in London, to obtain the e&s;tabli&s;hment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> equal religious liberty in this land. And the compiler of this hi&s;tory was then reque&s;ted by a number of mini&s;ters to undertake the work; and Mr. Davis promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein. But, alas! he had done but little towards it before his health failed, and his life followed after. In Augu&s;t, 1772, he took a voyage to Philadelphia, hoping to receive benefit from his native air. And obtaining &s;ome relief, and meeting with one of his brethren in the mini&s;try, who was going to preach to the we&s;tern Indians, he &s;et out with him, in com|pany with friends who were going to &s;ettle upon the Ohio. But on February 1, 1773, the follow|ing account was publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, viz. "By advices from the Ohio we learn, that upon the 13th of December the Reverend John Davis, A. M. Fellow of Rhode-I&s;land college, and one of the members of the American Philo&s;ophical Society,
<PB N="277" REF="018336_0292_0FA5D0746950F720">died there, after an illne&s;s of three weeks, in the 36th year of his age." The mini&s;ter he was with in|forms us, that &s;ome of his la&s;t words were the&s;e: "In a little time I expect to be with Chri&s;t, to &s;ee and know him as he is now known, and as he is not known. My faith in my Saviour is un&s;haken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jones's journal, p. 24.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="7">VII. IN September, 1772, the author was cho|&s;en an agent of the Bapti&s;t churches in Mr. Davis's room; and the following events took place among them. Though their church in Chelmsford had given in certificates according to law, yet they were all taxed to pari&s;h teachers; and in a cold &s;ea&s;on, January 26, 1773, three of their &s;ociety were im|pri&s;oned therefor at Concord, one of whom was 82 years old; and they commenced a &s;uit in law for recompence; but their ca&s;es were long delayed. In Bellingham equal liberty was enjoyed, becau&s;e there was none but a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in the town; but a number of his hearers who lived in Mendon were &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes to other mini|&s;ters, that in the three preceding years they e&s;ti|mated their damages on that account at near Fifty Pounds. And the&s;e and other things being laid be|fore the Bapti&s;t committee, May 5, they advi&s;ed their agent to write to all their churches, to con&s;ider whether it was not their duty to refu&s;e to give any more certificates to the power that oppre&s;&s;ed them; and to bring in their conclu&s;ions upon it to their next A&s;&s;ociation. And further light was held up by their enemies a few days after. For, to vindi|cate their practice, they publi&s;hed an account of all their exempting laws in the Bo&s;ton Evening Po&s;t, of May 17, and as the fir&s;t of them ordered Epi&s;co|palians in each pari&s;h to be taxed with the re&s;t, and then that their mini&s;ters &s;hould draw the money out
<PB N="278" REF="018336_0293_0FA5D07553FBE010">of the pari&s;h trea&s;ury, it was now &s;aid, "Had the &s;ame prudent precaution been taken with re&s;pect to the Anabapti&s;ts, when they were exempted from be|ing taxed towards the maintenance of the mini&s;ters of the churches by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, tho&s;e avaricious and di&s;&s;olute per&s;ons, who get under water to wa&s;h away their mini&s;ter's rates, without any expectation or de|&s;ire of wa&s;hing away their &s;ins, would have had little or no temptation to declare them&s;elves Anabapti&s;ts." When the Warren A&s;&s;ociation met at Medfield, September 7, 1773, they concluded to refrain from giving any more certificates to that power, for the&s;e rea&s;ons.

When the author came to Bo&s;ton to compleat this publica|tion, he met with two printed letters again&s;t the de&s;ign; to which he returned the following reply, on October 14. "Mr. Draper, as you have allow|ed a pretended Bapti&s;t room for two long letters in your paper of the 2d and 30th of September, I hope you will give a real Bapti&s;t room for a &s;hort an&s;wer to him in your next. I call him a pre|tended
<PB N="279" REF="018336_0294_0FA5D075DAE2B0C0">Bapti&s;t, and think I have rea&s;on &s;o to do; for though he gives his word for it that he is of our denomination, yet the whole tenor of his letters is, to per&s;uade us to be ea&s;y under the taxing laws of the other party; and towards the clo&s;e of his fir&s;t letter he &s;ays, <HI>had we for a little while borne only the little finger of the Epi&s;copalian hierarchy, we &s;hould think the burthen comparatively light, though we were called to bear the weight of the loins of the Pre&s;byterians of New-England.</HI> And is not the hand of Joab in all this! For my part, I am not able to get a pair of &s;cales &s;ufficient to weigh tho&s;e two great bodies in, the Epi&s;copal hierarchy and the New-England Pre&s;|byterains, &s;o as to find out exactly which is heavie&s;t: But if this pretended brother had felt what father Obadiah Holmes once felt in Bo&s;ton from our oppo|nents, he would not have been &s;o ea&s;y as he now &s;eems to be." Hereby a &s;top was put to that mean and &s;candalous practice, of a&s;&s;uming the Bapti&s;t name, in writings again&s;t their welfare. Neither did any an&s;wer ever appear to the above rea&s;ons for equal liberty, though oppre&s;&s;ion was &s;till carried on un|der religious pretences.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. BY a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Haverhill, a Bapti&s;t church was regularly formed at Goreham, near Ca&s;co-Bay, June 20, 1768. And Jo&s;eph Moody, a member of it, who lived in Scarborough, had the &s;ame certified annually to their pari&s;h a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors ac|cording to law; yet di&s;tre&s;s was &s;till made upon him for taxes to pari&s;h wor&s;hip. For &s;uch a tax of about Six Dollars, a good riding bea&s;t was taken from him in 1771; he therefore pre&s;ented proper vouchers of the&s;e facts to the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, January 26, 1774, with a petition, that like the good Samaritan they would again &s;et him upon his own bea&s;t. A committee was &s;ent out upon it, who&s;e report was to
<PB N="280" REF="018336_0295_0FA5D076D23D9610">di&s;mi&s;s the petition, which was done. About this time eighteen men, of the Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Warwick, in a very cold &s;ea&s;on, were &s;eized for a pari&s;h tax, and carried forty miles, and ca&s;t into Northampton gaol. On February 15, an account thereof was brought to the agent of the Bapti&s;t churches, who directly laid their ca&s;e before the Legi&s;lature at Bo&s;ton; praying that they might be relea&s;ed, that recom|pence might be made them, and effectual mea&s;ures taken to prevent &s;uch things for the future. But, though a committee was &s;ent out upon it, no help was granted. This moved one of the Bapti&s;t com|mittee to expre&s;s his a&s;toni&s;hment thereat, in the gazette of March 3, and to a&s;k how this news would be received in &s;i&s;ter Colonies, or at the Briti&s;h Court, from whence late help had been afforded to our A&s;h|field brethren? A reply hereto came out March 14, which &s;aid, "No one can deny that they have been in great trouble of late; and whoever con&s;iders how dangerous the occupation of counterfeiting an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed currency is, they cannot greatly admire at it." Which inuendo was catched at, and enlarged upon in the Providence gazette. Though in fact a Pedobapti&s;t church member in A&s;hfield had, before this, been convicted of harbouring a counterfeiting club at his hou&s;e, for which the Court gave judg|ment that he &s;hould be fined, &s;et in the pillory, and have his ears cropt; while a Bapti&s;t member, whom they had en&s;nared, was only fined. Thus do men expo&s;e them&s;elves, when they drag into religious controver&s;y things which have no relation to it. In a Bo&s;ton paper of April 7, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Warwick publi&s;hed a vindication of them&s;elves in taxing tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts, in which they &s;aid, "We apprehend that every body politic have a right to choo&s;e their re|ligion, and to enact laws for its &s;upport, and that
<PB N="281" REF="018336_0296_0FA5D0776542B240">they ought &s;o to do: And &s;ince Congregationali&s;m is the choice of the people of this Province, the re|ligion which our forefathers had in view to e&s;tabli&s;h in coming over to this country, we think there is good rea&s;on why di&s;&s;enters from us &s;hould pay to the &s;upport of it; e&s;pecially &s;ince it is one condition upon which they receive and hold their lands." This la&s;t article is flatly denied, and let any of that party prove it if they can. And will any &s;till plead for a practice that cannot be upheld without lying! Another evil effect of it is before us.</P>
<P N="9">IX. ONE of the Chelmsford ca&s;es was now tried at Charle&s;town. Jonathan Sewal, the lawyer who was mo&s;t active again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts of Haverhill, undertook for them; and he mu&s;t needs put the collector as well as the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors into the writ. The effect of which was, that the jury judged the a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors to be guilty, and the collector not guilty; and that the Bapti&s;t &s;hould recover of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors Three Pounds damages and co&s;ts, while the col|lector &s;hould recover co&s;ts of the Bapti&s;t for car|rying him to pri&s;on, where he was confined above three days. The guilty a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;oon had their ex|pences paid by the town; but as the Judges and &s;aid lawyer went off directly, the other Chelmsford ca&s;es were never tried, nor the &s;mall &s;um now adjudged to one of them received. And no exempting law for the Bapti&s;ts in this Province was now in force. The&s;e things being heard of at Philadelphia, cau&s;ed an unea&s;ine&s;s among the Pre&s;byterians there, and a man was &s;ent from thence to Bo&s;ton, and a new ex|empting act was pa&s;&s;ed at Salem in June; after which it was declared in a Philadelphia paper, that relief was granted to the Bapti&s;ts in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts. Such pains have that &s;ect taken to keep up their credit and influence in this country. But that
<PB N="282" REF="018336_0297_0FA5D07B042B3708">act was &s;o far from affording us any relief, that it required annual certificates to be recorded in each pari&s;h where the Bapti&s;ts lived, a copy of which could not be had without <HI>Fourpence</HI> of our money, which is <HI>Threepence</HI> &s;terling; the very tax upon a pound of tea that brought on the American war.</P>

<P N="1">1. DISPUTES about power and gain, under a religious ma&s;k, could no longer be re|&s;trained to words, but mu&s;t come to dreadful blows. To this tho&s;e claims have always tended. When Henry the 8th revolted from the church of Rome, and &s;et him&s;elf up as head of the church of England, he ruled as tyrannically as the Pope did; though his allowing the common people to have the bible in their own tongue, gave much light to the nation. And a greater reformation was pro|duced
<PB N="283" REF="018336_0298_0FA5D07B2715B8D8">thereby, in the &s;hort reign of his &s;on Ed|ward, than the church of England has ever attain|ed to &s;ince. Neither do their ideas differ &s;o much from ours about facts, as about the names they ought to be called by. An Epi&s;copal mini&s;ter of con&s;iderable note, after thirty years labour to pro|mote their way in New-England, gave the follow|ing account of the cau&s;e of its fir&s;t plantation. Says he, "While the virgin Queen, of immortal me|mory, &s;at at the helm, &s;he &s;teered &s;o &s;teady a cour&s;e, and rode with &s;o tight a rein, that Calvin's Engli&s;h di&s;ciples, impregnated with the leaven of Geneva, could do little more, upon their return, after the Maria per&s;ecution, than fret in their fetters, mur|mur, and mutter their di&s;contents in &s;ecret.&mdash;To Elizabeth &s;ucceeded James, father of the martyr. He imagining it more for his ea&s;e, threw away the Queen's curb, and rode with a &s;naffle. Under this &s;oft Sovereign the non cons &s;eem, by the Gal|lioti&s;m of the &s;tate, and Grindalizing of the church, to have grown into great numbers. But Charles re&s;umed, in &s;ome &s;ort, the heroine's bridle, and gave leave to Laud to make u&s;e of whip and &s;pur; &s;o the &s;turdy Puritan, unu&s;ed to re&s;traint, and growing re&s;tive, finding that flouncing and plunging would not throw down, ran away from his riders, and took &s;anctuary in New-England. But good God! how dearly did that mo&s;t pious Prince and holy prelate pay for this! and how fatal and la&s;ting have been the con|&s;equences of that GRAND REBELLION, that brought both of tho&s;e great per&s;onages to the block<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters from Narragan&s;et, 1752, by James M'Sparran, D.

That is, Charles claimed a night to impo&s;e laws and taxes upon the people without their con&s;ent, and

In the mean time, an imagination of great purity at Bo&s;ton emboldened the church to a&s;&s;ume the whole government in this wilderne&s;s, with an expectation of exhibiting to the world &s;uch a view of the glory of Chri&s;tianity, as had never before been &s;een. And the leaders here were enchanted with this bright image, until their char|ter was wre&s;ted from them in 1684; upon which the world re&s;olutely took the bridle again into their own hands.

Methinks I hear the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;ay|ing, our fleets and armies have triumphed over all our enemies, and we are revered to the re|mote&s;t regions. The wealth of both the Indies is ours, and our re&s;ources are boundle&s;s. The va&s;t continent of North-America is wholly at our com|mand, and who can hinder our doing as we plea&s;e? Arts and &s;ciences are already carried very high, and who knows how much greater improvements may be made? As to religion, fanatici&s;m and bigotry are quite out of fa&s;hion, and rea&s;on and liberty are the darling topics of the age. Epi&s;copacy prevails in almo&s;t all our Colonies, and &s;oon will in the re|mainder. Parliaments have formerly made dread|ful work; cut off the head of one King, and drove another from his throne; but tho&s;e days of &s;uper|&s;tition and cruelty are at an end. The Parliament

And we are a&s;&s;ured, by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable gentlement upon the continent, that as &s;oon as it is &s;een that government is determined to maintain its authority, oppo&s;ition will cea&s;e, and the land will be at re&s;t.

<P N="3">III. I AM &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e ideas will not plea&s;e &s;ome men; therefore the following facts are adduced to &s;upport them. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible plea for the claim of Britain to tax America was, that we were indebted to her for protection. If &s;o, why did &s;he pay us large &s;ums, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in her wars? Our conque&s;t of Cape-Breton, in 1745, brought her into debt to us, for which &s;he &s;ent us over a good quantity of ca&s;h, whereby we were enabled to call in our paper money. Yet, through jealou&s;y of our power, acts of Parliament were pa&s;&s;ed in 1749 to prohibit, under great penalties, the erection of any
<PB N="287" REF="018336_0302_0FA5CF09B90D4150">tilt-hammers here to plate iron, furnaces to make &s;teel, or &s;litting-mills to cut nail-rods; although no country abounds more than ours with iron. All this and much mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was patiently borne, and re|qui&s;itions from the crown, of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;uc|ceeding wars, were obeyed beyond our proportion; for which large &s;ums were repaid by Parliament: Did this look as if they thought we were in debt to them? By no means. But &s;oon after the peace of 1763, they pa&s;&s;ed an act to compel the Colonies to furni&s;h certain articles for a &s;tanding army therein in the time of peace; the great engine of de&s;poti&s;m. And as this act was but partly obeyed in New-York, their legi&s;lative power was &s;u&s;pended, until they &s;hould do it fully. To this the &s;tamp-act was added, to deprive America of any legal deeds of our lands, or &s;ecurities for our money, without paying a tax therefor to Britain. And when they were forced to repeal that act in March, 1766, it was re&s;olved, "That his Maje&s;ty in Parliament, of right, had power to bind the people of the Colonies by &s;ta|tutes IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." William War|burton, Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, had delivered a &s;er|mon, the preceding month, before the &s;ociety who &s;upported their mi&s;&s;ionaries in America, wherein he called the inhabitants of it factious people, rea|dy to laugh at the bible; and &s;aid, "The &s;pread|ing of GENTILISM in the Colonies calls for our rejected charity." And to render them as odious as po&s;&s;ible, he accu&s;ed them of annually &s;tealing &s;laves from the oppo&s;ite continent, and &s;acrificing them to <HI>their</HI> great idol, the <HI>god of gain.</HI> "No|thing (&s;ays he) is more certain, than that the in|famous traffic for &s;laves directly infringes both divine and human law.

Yet it is mo&s;t certain that his party, in the &s;outhern Colonies, and in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, have had the chief hand in that infamous traffic. February 20, 1767, John Ewer, Bi&s;hop of Landaff, before the &s;ame &s;ociety, &s;aid of the fir&s;t planters of New-England, "What reproach could be ca&s;t heavier than they de&s;erve? who, with their native &s;oil, abandoned their native manners and religion; and ere long were found in many parts living without remembrance or knowledge of God, without any divine wor&s;hip, in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners. In&s;tead of con|verting barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbarians. And is it not &s;ome aggravation of their &s;hame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pretences and <HI>conditions</HI> under which they obtain|ed <HI>royal grants</HI> and public authority?" And having expre&s;&s;ed his earne&s;t de&s;ire and hopes of the &s;peedy e&s;tabli&s;hment of bi&s;hops in America, he &s;ays, "This point obtained, the American church will &s;oon go out of its infant &s;tate; be able to &s;tand upon its own legs, and without foreign help <HI>&s;upport</HI> and &s;pread it&s;elf.

Dr. Thomas Bradbury Chand|ler, of New-Jer&s;ey, now publi&s;hed a book upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; wherein he owns it as the opinion of many, that the circum&s;tances of the nation now af|forded the mo&s;t favourable pro&s;pect of the &s;peedy e&s;tabli&s;hment of bi&s;hops here, that had ever appear|ed &s;ince Queen Ann's death. Yet he had the face to
<PB N="289" REF="018336_0304_0FA5CF0B335649C8">declare that &s;uch a plan was agreed upon, "That bi&s;hops &s;hall not interfere with the property or pri|vileges, whether civil or religious, of churchmen or di&s;&s;enters&mdash;but &s;hall only ordain and govern the clergy, and admini&s;ter confirmation to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chandler's appeal to the public, p. 50&mdash;54, 79.</NOTE>." The tea and gla&s;s-act was pa&s;&s;ed this year; which moved the Penn&s;ylvania Farmer to write his elegant letters upon our public danger; the fir&s;t of which was dated November 5, 1767. As tho&s;e letters were greatly e&s;teemed, and had very exten&s;ive effects, ten letters by way of an&s;wer to them were publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, in 1769. Much pains were taken therein to per&s;uade us that the Farmer had given fal&s;e alarms, and that our liberties were in no real danger; and yet in the ninth letter it was &s;aid, "The que&s;tion whether the Parliament can lay <HI>internal</HI> taxes could be deter|mined be&s;t by con&s;idering the power of that body to alter or vacate charters. The Parliament can annul our charters <HI>at will</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here is a power claimed by man, which, with reverence be it &s;poken, is what the eternal JEHOVAH never a&s;&s;umed!

In June following his letter to a member of Parliament, of January 20, 1769, was publi&s;hed by the A&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton, wherein he &s;aid, "I never think of the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for the peace and good order of the Co|lonies without pain. There mu&s;t be an <HI>abridgment</HI> of what are called Engli&s;h liberties." This, and other original letters, were procured and &s;ent back by the amiable and judicious Franklin, our agent at the Briti&s;h Court; who, as &s;oon as this was known there, was &s;purned from thence with much &s;corn and bitterne&s;s; an infallible evidence that what they were in pur&s;uit of were <HI>the works of darkne&s;s;</HI> for <HI>he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anife&s;t.</HI> John iii. 20, 21.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IN November following arrived large car|goes of tea, which were &s;ent over to e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent of the power of the Briti&s;h Parliament to tax this country internally. From Philadelphia and New-York it was &s;ent back, and not &s;uffered to be landed; and the &s;ame was earne&s;tly tried for at Bo&s;ton: But Governor Hutchin&s;on reduced his native town to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of either &s;uffer|ing it to be landed, and the tax thereon paid, or el&s;e of ca&s;ting it into the &s;ea; and the latter was cho&s;en. Now the character of tho&s;e who teach God's fear by the precepts of men, is to <HI>watch for iniquity:</HI> And when accounts of this and other tran&s;actions arrived in March, 1774, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try imagined that they had got enough of it to cover and carry their arbitrary de&s;igns. And
<PB N="291" REF="018336_0306_0FA5CF0C8F406758">&s;uch u&s;e was made thereof, as to procure one act of Parliament to &s;hut up the port of Bo&s;ton, until their power was obeyed there; a &s;econd to rob the people of this Province of their right to choo&s;e their own Council; a third to &s;creen the executors of their orders from puni&s;hment, even if they com|mitted murder in doing it; and a fourth greatly to enlarge the Province of Quebec, to e&s;tabli&s;h Pope|ry therein, and to deprive its inhabitants of their right of trials by jury, and other Engli&s;h liberties. As the&s;e were ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, Thomas Gage, the chief commander of all the Briti&s;h forces in Ame|rica, was appointed Governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in order to carry them into effect. And he arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Bo&s;ton May 13, where he met the A&s;&s;embly the 25th, but &s;oon prorogued them to Salem, where a few acts were pa&s;&s;ed, and then they were di&s;&s;olv|ed, never to meet again upon their former con&s;ti|tution. The port of Bo&s;ton was &s;hut up in June, and in Augu&s;t twenty-four of the thirty-&s;ix Coun|&s;ellors, appointed for us by the crown, were &s;worn into office; and writs were i&s;&s;ued for a new choice of repre&s;entatives, to meet them at Salem the 5th of October. But a week before that time the Governor, by proclamation, forbid their meeting; becau&s;e the people had compelled &s;ome of tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors to re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions, and the re&s;t were afraid to venture out of Bo&s;ton. Yet mo&s;t of the repre&s;entatives met, re&s;olved them|&s;elves into a Provincial Congre&s;s, and &s;at at &s;everal times and places, until they di&s;&s;olved on Decem|ber 10; having taken various &s;teps towards the internal regulation and defence of the country, and propo&s;ed a new choice of delegates from the towns, to meet in February. In the mean time all the&s;e Colonies con&s;idered the ca&s;e of Bo&s;ton as their own,
<PB N="292" REF="018336_0307_0FA5CF0D39EB7038">and &s;ent large contributions to its &s;uffering inha|bitants. Delegates from twelve Colonies met at Philadelphia, September 5, and &s;at till October 26, &s;tated the unalienable rights of mankind, and the nature, limits and end of civil government, in a clear manner; and &s;ent addre&s;&s;es to the throne, and to various parts of the empire, well calculated to expo&s;e, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove the dangers that hung over our liberties. They al&s;o recom|mended wi&s;e mea&s;ures for our internal regulation; and, in the name of their con&s;tituents, &s;olemnly covenanted to refrain from importing any Briti&s;h goods, or exporting any of ours to them, after cer|tain times &s;et; if &s;aid oppre&s;&s;ive acts &s;hould not then be repealed, until their repeal was effected.</P>
<P>IN the night preceding September 1, a party of &s;oldiers went and &s;eized a large quantity of powder, in a public &s;tore in Cambridge, which, with &s;ome field pieces, they brought off to Bo&s;ton; upon which a report flew like the wind, that Gage had &s;ent out his troops, who were killing the peo|ple. Multitudes were alarmed hereby, and were marching in arms to relieve their friends, until this report was contradicted. And on Lord's day, February 26, 1775, a field officer, with about an hundred men, &s;ailed from the ca&s;tle to Marblehead, and then marched nimbly to Sa|lem, to fetch &s;ome pieces of artillery from thence; but were defeated in their de&s;ign by the vigilance of the people. After which Colonel Gilbert col|lected a quantity of arms and ammunition at Free|town, and &s;ent to the Governor for protection; who thereupon wrote to the authority of Bri&s;tol county, to make provi&s;ion for two hundred &s;ol|diers there: But, before they marched, &s;ome thou|&s;ands of the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled on April 10, &s;eiz|ed
<PB N="293" REF="018336_0308_0FA5CF0DF0526838">tho&s;e war &s;tores, and di&s;per&s;ed that ne&s;t of ene|mies at Freetown. Yet after all this, and much more of like nature, we are informed, that the Mandamus Coun&s;ellors at Bo&s;ton were under &s;uch an infatuation, as to give it as their opinion, that their countrymen would not venture to fight again&s;t the King's troops; and to advi&s;e their Governor to try the experiment, by &s;ending a body of them to de&s;troy or bring away the &s;tores that were col|lected at Concord. But though this advice was followed with great &s;ecre&s;y, by cro&s;&s;ing the water from Bo&s;ton common in the dead of the night, &s;o as to get twelve miles in their way before &s;unri&s;e, yet they then &s;aw a company of the militia collected to oppo&s;e them; of whom they killed eight men on the &s;pot, and then marched &s;ix miles further to Concord; where they &s;hot down two men more, before our people fired upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a mo&s;t certain fact, though it was contradicted by our enemies in London.</NOTE> And they not only u&s;ed their endeavours to de&s;troy &s;ome cannon and carriages, but al&s;o ca&s;t a con&s;iderable quantity of flour into the river. Hereupon the cowardly Americans drove the heroic Britons back to their &s;hips the &s;ame day, with much terror and &s;laughter, although near two thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops were employed in the affair; which will tran&s;mit the remembrance of Lexington, and the 19th of April, down to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="5">V. BUT how the inhabitants of a country of fifteen hundred miles extent, divided into thirteen Colonies, very differently con&s;tituted, wherein were per&s;ons of almo&s;t all nations, &s;ects and opi|nions, could unite again&s;t the arbitrary claims of the mo&s;t powerful kingdom upon earth, and could per&s;evere therein for eight tedious years, in de|fiance

Pride and di&s;|obedience to him had arrived to &s;uch height in both countries, that we mu&s;t become dreadful &s;courges to each other, to di&s;cover what was in our hearts, whether we would keep his command|ments or not.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A SECOND Provincial Congre&s;s met at Con|cord; February 1, and proceeded to further mea|&s;ures for the defence of our liberties; and other Colonies did the like. The A&s;&s;embly at Provi|dence, in December, had ordered the cannon to be brought up there from their fort near New-port, which were now conveyed to the camp be|fore Bo&s;ton, formed by the militia, who a&s;&s;embled by thou&s;ands, and filled the towns and villages, from the bay &s;outh of Bo&s;ton to My&s;tic river on the north; being a circle of twenty miles. On the other hand, the Briti&s;h Generals, Howe, Bur|goyne and Clinton, arrived with large reinforce|ments to their army at Bo&s;ton. Charle&s;town, to the north of it, lies, as that does, upon a penin&s;ula, the latter betwixt Charles and My&s;tic rivers. It contained above four hundred hou&s;es, many of them very elegant. June 17 the Briti&s;h com|manders perceived that the Americans had begun to fortify a hill on the north &s;ide of Charle&s;town; upon which the town was &s;urrounded with their &s;hips and floating batteries, and then their army landed to attack our entrenchment. Burgoyne
<PB N="295" REF="018336_0310_0FA5CF0F7A79DD28">was upon a hill in the northea&s;t part of Bo&s;ton; and eight days after he wrote the following ac|count of the action to England. Says he, "If we look to the height, Howe's corps a&s;cending the hill in the face of entrenchments, and in a ve|ry di&s;advantageous ground, was much engaged; to the left the enemy pouring fre&s;h troops, by thou&s;ands, over the land, and in the arm of the &s;ea our &s;hips and floating batteries cannonading them; &s;traight before us a large and noble town in one great blaze; the church &s;teeples, being of timber, were great pyramids of fire above the re&s;t, behind us, the church &s;teeples and heights of our own camp covered with &s;pectators of the re&s;t of our army which was engaged; the hills round the country covered with &s;pectators, the enemy all in anxious &s;u&s;pence; the roar of cannon, mortars and mu&s;quetry, the cru&s;h of churches, &s;hips upon the &s;tocks, and whole &s;treets falling together in ruins, to fill the ear; the &s;torm of redoubts, with the ob|jects above de&s;cribed to fill the eye, and the re|flexion that perhaps a defeat was a final lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h empire in America, to fill the mind&mdash;made the whole a picture and complication of hor|ror and importance, beyond any thing that ever came to my lot to be witne&s;s to.&mdash;Yet the day end|ed with glory, and the &s;ucce&s;s was mo&s;t important, con&s;idering the a&s;cendency it gave the regular troops; but the lo&s;s was uncommon in officers, for the number engaged."</P>
<P N="7">VII. CAN this be believed by po&s;terity? Major Pitcairn, who was mo&s;t forward in firing upon our people at Lexington, was now &s;lain, with two other field officers, two of Howe's aids, &s;even Cap|tains, and about eight hundred men; be&s;ides near
<PB N="296" REF="018336_0311_0FA5CF1026621490">as many more who died of their wounds, while our lo&s;s was but about half that number. All this in driving the de&s;pi&s;ed Americans from a redoubt they had rai&s;ed in one night, under the direction of a phy&s;ician<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Honorable Jo&s;eph Warren, of Bo&s;ton, who had ju&s;t before been appointed a Major-General by our Pro|vincial Congre&s;s.</NOTE> as their chief commander; and af|ter he fell, the Briti&s;h veterans did not venture to pur&s;ue our people, though it might have been done for half a mile, under the protection of their own &s;hips and batteries. Is this their glory! it was glorying in their &s;hame. And a plain account of their motives here follows. Charles Lee had been an officer under Burgoyne in the la&s;t war, and had contracted a near friend&s;hip with him; and hearing of his arrival at Bo&s;ton, he &s;ent him a letter, which Burgoyne an&s;wered from thence, Ju|ly 8; and &s;aid, "The vital principle of the con&s;ti|tution, in which it moves and has its being, is the &s;upremacy of the King in Parliament: A com|pound, indefinite, indefea&s;ible power, coeval with the origin of the empire, and co-exten&s;ive over all its parts." And having laid this as his foundation, he, in an artful manner, went on to compare our conduct with theirs who beheaded Charles, and &s;et up Cromwell; and that of his party, to tho&s;e who expelled James, and crowned William; and then &s;ays, "The&s;e principles, depend upon it, actuate the army and fleet throughout; and let me at the &s;ame time add, that there are few if any gentlemen among us who would have drawn their &s;words in the cau&s;e of &s;lavery.&mdash;I know Great-Britain is ready to open her arms upon the fir&s;t overture of accommo|dation. I know &s;he is equally <HI>re&s;olute</HI> to maintain
<PB N="297" REF="018336_0312_0FA5CF110AF461E0">her original rights; and if the war proceeds, your one hundred and fifty thou&s;and men will not be a match for HER POWER." This was their capital argument; which, however, failed him and his ar|my at Saratoga two years after. Our &s;econd Con|tinental Congre&s;s met at Philadelphia May 10, and &s;ent a petition to the King, wherein they a&s;&s;ured him, that their ardent de&s;ire was, for the re&s;toration of the former harmony between the two countries, and for its e&s;tabli&s;hment upon a permanent and la&s;ting ba&s;is; and &s;aid, "Our brea&s;ts retain too tender a regard for the kingdom from which we derive our origin, to reque&s;t &s;uch a reconciliation as might in any manner be incon|&s;i&s;tent with her <HI>dignity and welfare.</HI>" And they prayed him to direct to &s;ome mode wherein &s;uch a reconciliation might be accompli&s;hed. On Sep|tember 1, this petition was delivered to Lord Dart|mouth, by Governor Penn, and Mr. Arthur Lee; to whom the mini&s;ter &s;aid, "No an&s;wer would be given." Now compare this with Burgoyne's de|claration. He called their claims over the Colonies original rights, and the vital principle of the con|&s;titution; which was &s;o oppo&s;ite to truth, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any men ever to have &s;uch a right to power over others: And in&s;tead of a readine&s;s for accommodation, they were earne&s;tly barring the door again&s;t it. General Gage covenanted with our friends in Bo&s;ton, that if they would deliver up their arms and ammunition, they &s;hould have liberty to go out with their other effects. But when he had thus di&s;armed them, he violated his promi&s;e in a &s;hameful manner; which rai&s;ed both the re&s;entment and the contempt of the country again&s;t his party. It taught the people not to con|fide
<PB N="298" REF="018336_0313_0FA5CF11FAD1C128">in their promi&s;es, and al&s;o to de&s;pi&s;e them; as being afraid, that if our women and children were not kept there as ho&s;tages, the people would ru&s;h in and de&s;troy or captivate their boa&s;ting army.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. ON the other hand, becau&s;e Cromwell, with the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent, but not the inno|cency of the dove, made a great overturn in the nation, which yet ended in confu&s;ion and &s;lavery, our enemies imagined that nothing better could take place here, if we revolted from their King. But how far are God's thoughts above theirs? He rai&s;ed up a man in Virginia, the olde&s;t of our Colonels, who, by the Congre&s;s, was unanimou&s;ly appointed the chief commander of our armies; and as &s;uch arrived at the camp at Cambridge July 2. And through eight perilous campaigns he was pre&s;erv|ed in &s;afety and health, was enabled to unite rea|&s;on and re&s;olution, authority and mildne&s;s, until his country was delivered from the mo&s;t imminent dan|gers, and peace re&s;tored to the nations; and then he as readily re&s;igned his command as ever he re|ceived it, and joyfully retired into a private &s;tation, followed with the univer&s;al e&s;teem and ble&s;&s;ings of his country; while a demon&s;tration is hereby held up to all the world, that prudence, upright|ne&s;s and benevolence, will procure and pre&s;erve that honor, authority and happine&s;s, which are in vain &s;ought for in any other way.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. SINCE the Bapti&s;ts have often been op|pre&s;&s;ed in this land, and would have &s;uf|fered more than they did, had it not been for re|&s;traints from Great-Britain, how came they to join in a war again&s;t her? Many have wondered at it, and &s;ome have cen&s;ured them &s;everely therefor. But they had the following rea&s;ons for their con|duct.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Where Epi&s;copalians have had all the power of government, they have never allowed others &s;o much liberty as we here enjoyed. In England all are taxed to their wor&s;hip, while none are admitted into civil offices but communicants
<PB N="300" REF="018336_0315_0FA5CF13DAD4E968">in their church. In Virginia, they cruelly impri|&s;oned Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters, only for preaching the go&s;|pel to peri&s;hing &s;ouls without licence from their Courts, until this war compelled them to de&s;i&s;t therefrom. Of this we had inconte&s;tible evidence. Therefore we could have no rational hopes of any real advantage in joining with them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The wor&s;t treatment we here met with came from the &s;ame principles, and much of it from the &s;ame per&s;ons, as the American war did. Many proofs of this have already been given, and more are at hand if called for.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in Ame|rica publicly held forth, that all righteous govern|ment is founded in compact, expre&s;&s;ed or implied; which is equally binding upon rulers and ruled; &s;o that every officer, whether &s;ucceeding or elect|ed, who intermeddles in any matter not fairly de|rived from thence, goes beyond his commi&s;&s;ion. (Vol. 1, p. 168.) When therefore our country|men adopted the&s;e principles, and founded their oppo&s;ition to arbitrary claims wholly thereon, how could we avoid joining with them? For,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. tho&s;e claims appeared to us ab&s;olutely unju&s;t, and a di|rect violation of the immutable rules of truth and equity; &s;o that a concurrence with them would have brought &s;uch guilt upon our con&s;ciences, as is infinitely wor&s;e than all the frowns of men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Though heavy corrections were to be expect|ed, yet a &s;trong hope was begotten of final deliver|ance to this land; the good effects whereof might hereafter return to the people who now invaded our rights. It is not pretended that our denomi|nation were all agreed, or had equal clearne&s;s in the&s;e points; but a majority of them were, more or le&s;s, influenced thereby.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="301" REF="018336_0316_0FA5CF149E849388">
II. A MAIN ground of the hope now mentioned, was the gracious vi&s;itations granted from time to time, in various parts of this country, which be|&s;poke a de&s;ign of final deliverance, and not of de|&s;truction or &s;lavery. Within &s;even years pa&s;t &s;eve|ral thou&s;ands had been hopefully converted from the errors of their ways, in Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia. In and after the year 1773, a pow|erful work prevailed in Pittsfield, Adams, Lane&s;|borough, Hancock, and other towns in Berk&s;hire; and the like in the adjacent parts of the county of Albany, and into the State of Vermont; which rai&s;ed and increa&s;ed many Bapti&s;t churches there. And, to come nearer home, the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough was reduced very low, until a revival began in the &s;pring of 1773, which by the fall of 1775 cau&s;ed the addition of ninety members to that church, and thirty to our third church in this town. The work extended into the ea&s;t and mo&s;t uncultivated part of Freetown, where it rai&s;ed a new church, and another in Dartmouth. In November, 1774, a like ble&s;&s;ing was granted in Attleborough, which in ten months added thirty members to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there, and a number more to other &s;ocieties. In December this revival extended into Providence, where it prevail|ed gloriou&s;ly through the winter. Their college en|joyed a precious &s;hare of it, the good effects where|of are &s;till experienced in di&s;tant churches. In ten months, more than an hundred per&s;ons were added to the Bapti&s;t church there, be&s;ide large additions to other churches in the town. And though the alarms of war in the &s;pring cau&s;ed a great interrup|tion of &s;piritual exerci&s;es and enjoyments, in places near the &s;cene of action, yet the &s;ame were pro|moted thereby in di&s;tant places. At the time of the
<PB N="302" REF="018336_0317_0FA5CF1599313418">Bunker-Hill battle, a young phy&s;ician was convert|ed at Harverd, thirty-five miles off, who was called the next year to preach the go&s;pel; and he is now pa&s;tor of a large Bapti&s;t church there, who are chief|ly the &s;eals of his mini&s;try. Royal&s;ton and Rich|mond, to the northward, and Suffield, to the we&s;t|ward, were favoured with a con&s;iderable revival of religion at this time, as Pomfret, Killingly, and other towns in Connecticut, were in 1776. And while the defence of the civil rights of Ame|rica appeared a matter of great importance, our religious liberties were by no means to be neglect|ed; and the conte&s;t concerning each kept a pretty even pace through the war.</P>
<P N="3">III. VIEWING the Continental Congre&s;s as our highe&s;t civil re&s;ort, the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, at their meeting at Medfield, September 13, 1774, agreed to &s;end their agent to Philadelphia, there to follow the be&s;t advice he could obtain, to pro|cure &s;ome influence from thence in their favour. A Convention of the county of Suffolk, at this time the head county of our Province, gave coun|tenance to this procedure; for their &s;eventeenth re&s;olve &s;ays, "This county, confiding in the wi&s;|dom and integrity of the Continental Congre&s;s, now &s;itting at Philadelphia, will pay all due re|&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be recommended by them to the Colonies, for the re&s;toration and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our ju&s;t rights, civil and <HI>religious</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Congre&s;s gave their &s;pecial approbation of the&s;e re&s;olves.</NOTE>." The&s;e re&s;olves were carried by &s;aid agent to that city; where he met with an A&s;&s;ociation of Bapti&s;t churches, from &s;everal ad|jacent Colonies, who elected a large Committee to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the affair, and by their reque&s;t a confer|ence
<PB N="303" REF="018336_0318_0FA5CF17182E6E00">was procured in the evening of October 14, with the Honorable Delegates from our Province to Congre&s;s, in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal more of their members, and other gentlemen. It was opened by reading a brief memorial of our chief grievances in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on religious ac|counts, which our Delegates endeavoured to an|&s;wer; fir&s;t by denying that we had any cau&s;e for &s;uch complaints, and then by attempting to ca&s;t all the blame thereof upon the executive depart|ment, and a&s;&s;erting that our Legi&s;lature were en|tirely clear of it; but plain facts, e&s;pecially in the A&s;hfield affair, confuted both of the&s;e pleas; and the conference was clo&s;ed with a promi&s;e from &s;aid Delegates of the exertion of their influence in our favour. But as &s;ome in Philadelphia made an attempt to turn the&s;e things again&s;t the gene|ral union of the Colonies, in the defence of our civil rights, a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread in New-England, before &s;aid Bapti&s;t agent got home, that he had been to Philadelphia on purpo&s;e to break that union. And while he was gone, the fir&s;t pari&s;h in his own town voted to tax all the Bapti&s;ts therein to their mini&s;ter, becau&s;e they re|fu&s;ed to give them any more certificates. He therefore &s;oon met the Bapti&s;t committee at Bo&s;|ton, by who&s;e advice a plain memorial of their grievances and de&s;ires was laid before our Provin|cial Congre&s;s; to which the following an&s;wer was returned.</P>

<P>OUR former charter provided, that when the Province &s;hould happen to be de&s;titute of any Go|vernor or Lieutenant-Governor, the Council and Repre&s;entatives &s;hould have the whole legi&s;lative power therein. Therefore, by the advice of the Continental Congre&s;s, &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly was con|vened at Watertown, July 19, 1775; to whom in September the Warren A&s;&s;ociation pre&s;ented a memorial, wherein, after mentioning the above advice, they &s;ay, "Our real grievances are, that we, as well as our fathers, have, from time to time, been taxed on religious accounts where we were not repre&s;ented; and when we have &s;ued for our rights, our cau&s;es have been tried by intere&s;t|ed judges. That the Repre&s;entatives in former A&s;&s;emblies, as well as the pre&s;ent, were elected by virtue only of civil and worldly qualifications, is a truth &s;o evident, that we pre&s;ume it need not be proved to this a&s;&s;embly; and for a civil Legi&s;lature to impo&s;e religions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">xes, is, we conceive, a power which their con&s;tituents never had to give; and is
<PB N="305" REF="018336_0320_0FA5CF1AF881DDB8">therefore going entirely out of their juri&s;diction.&mdash; Under the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, where God him&s;elf pre&s;cribed the exact proportion of what the peo|ple were to give, yet none but per&s;ons of the wor&s;t characters ever attempted to <HI>take it by force.</HI> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. Mica. iii. 5&mdash;9. How daring then mu&s;t it be for any to do it for Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, who &s;ays, <HI>my kingdom is not of this world!</HI>&mdash;We be&s;eech this honorable A&s;&s;embly to take the&s;e mat|ters into their wi&s;e and &s;erious con&s;ideration, before him who has &s;aid, <HI>with what mea&s;ure ye mete it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI> Is not all America now appealing to heaven, again&s;t the inju&s;tice of being taxed where we are not repre&s;ented, and again&s;t being judged by men who are intere&s;ted in getting away our mon? And will heaven approve of your <HI>doing the &s;ame thing</HI> to your fellow &s;ervants! No, &s;urely.&mdash;We have no de&s;ire of repre&s;enting this government as the wor&s;t of any who have impo&s;ed religious taxes; we fully believe the contrary. Yet, as we are per&s;uaded that an entire freedom from being taxed by civil rulers to religious wor&s;hip, is not a mere favour, from any man or men in the world, but a right and property granted us by God, who commands us to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in it,</HI> we have not only the &s;ame rea&s;on to refu&s;e an acknowledg|ment of &s;uch a taxing power here, as America has the above&s;aid power, but al&s;o, according to our pre&s;ent light, we &s;hould wrong our con&s;ciences in allowing that power to men, which we believe be|longs only to God."&mdash;This memorial was read in the A&s;&s;embly, and was ordered to lie a week on the ta|ble, and was then read again, and debated upon, and was referred to a committee, upon the receipt of who&s;e report it was read a third time, and li|berty granted to bring in a bill in our favour;
<PB N="306" REF="018336_0321_0FA5CF1CB61100E0">and &s;uch a bill was received and read once, and a time &s;et for a &s;econd reading: But then other bu&s;i|ne&s;s was crowded in, and nothing more done upon it. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of mankind.</P>
<P N="4">IV. As the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were deceived, and entirely di&s;appointed in their fir&s;t &s;cheme, a new one was invented, in the clo&s;e of 1775; which was, by acts of Parliament, to declare all the&s;e Colonies to be in a frate of rebellion, and out of the King's protection; to hire a large army from Germany, to add terror to the ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings of the Briti&s;h lion; and then to appoint Commi&s;&s;ioners to proclaim pardon and peace to any Colony or place that &s;hould &s;ub|mit to their power, and promi&s;e to rai&s;e as much money among them&s;elves as the Court of Britain &s;hould judge to be their proportion, towards the &s;upport and defence of government: Their peace to la&s;t as long as this was done. And in order to man the Briti&s;h &s;hips, and to make all afraid of their power their commanders were ordered to enter the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nes of as many of the captives whom they &s;hould take as they thought proper, among the li&s;t of their hands on board, &s;o as to compel them to fight again&s;t their own country, and to be puni&s;hed as de&s;erters, if they &s;hould attempt to make their e&s;cape. And had not the Lord been on our &s;ide, when men thus ro&s;e up again&s;t us, how &s;oon would they have &s;wallowed us up! But when, in his wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, he had given them all the advantages that could well be conceived of, how ea&s;ily did he turn their coun&s;els into fooli&s;hne&s;s? For when the Briti&s;h party in Bo&s;ton came to look out in the morning of March 13, 1776, behold! two &s;tately forts appeared on the top of two hills in Dorche&s;ter, capable of commanding both the town and the &s;hips in the harbour. Burgovne's
<PB N="307" REF="018336_0322_0FA5CF1CDD4345A0">letter to England the June before informs us, that his party had laid a plan to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e hills, which was to have been executed the 18th of that month; but was prevented by the Bunker-Hill battle the preceding day. And as the only land|pa&s;&s;age on to tho&s;e heights was acro&s;s an open mar&s;h, within half a mile of their guards on Bo&s;|ton-Neck, and as they had a multitude of their friends &s;cattered through the country, was it po&s;&s;i|ble for &s;everal hundred tuns weight of materials to be prepared before, and then to be carted &s;ome miles on to tho&s;e hills, and two forts to be erected there in one night, by the undi&s;ciplined Americans, and the &s;agacious Britons know nothing about it! Yet &s;uch was the event; and let them deny it if they can. Not only &s;o, but while they were preparing to go over and attack tho&s;e forts, the winds and waves were put into &s;uch a commotion, as finally prevented the attempt. And on March 17 the Briti&s;h army, with a large number of our inimical countrymen, fled from Bo&s;ton; and &s;oon &s;ailed to Nova-Scotia, or to Britain. Indeed &s;ome of their men of war were left in Nanta&s;ket road, out of the reach of our cannon; yet on May 17 a &s;mall arm|ed ve&s;&s;el took a large &s;tore&s;hip of theirs in the bay, which was conveyed into Bo&s;ton in their &s;ight, and they had not power to prevent it, having on board a thou&s;and &s;tands of arms, fifteen hundred whole bar|rels of powder, and a large quantity of other nece&s;|&s;ary &s;upplies for our army. And on June 14 their &s;hips were compelled to quit the lower harbour, by the firing of &s;ome cannon which our people had con|veyed down the night before; whereby that port was again opened, which was cruelly &s;hut up two years before. And about four hundred and fifty of their troops were captivated by our cruizers about this
<PB N="308" REF="018336_0323_0FA5CF1DA9B77180">time; and a va&s;t quantity of their goods of all kinds were taken and brought into our country.</P>
<P N="5">V. NOT aware of &s;uch events, the next object of Briti&s;h policy was, to appoint &s;uch men to ex|ecute their new plan as &s;hould be able to divide the Colonies, by drawing &s;ome part of them to ac|cept of their pardons. And as Lord George Howe, who was &s;lain near Ticonderoga, July 6, 1758, was &s;o much beloved here, that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts were at the expence of erecting a monument for him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, who could be &s;o likely to gain upon our people as his two brothers? William was already appointed Governor of this Province, and Chief General of their armies; and Richard, &s;ucce&s;|&s;or in title to George, and an intimate friend to Dr. Franklin, was now made Chief Admiral of their fleet; and they were made joint Commi&s;&s;ioners to proclaim pardon to all who would accept of it on the above terms. And as an army of thirty-five thou&s;and men was to be at their command, who would not be glad to receive their pardon and pro|tection, rather than to be a mark for their re&s;ent|ment? But alas! the winds and waves were &s;o con|trary, that the two brothers could not meet, to &s;end out their proclamations, until July 12, eight days after the Congre&s;s, by the con&s;ent of the people in the thirteen Colonies, had declared them to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES. However, from on board their &s;hips near New-York, they &s;ent forth their proclamations, which our people readily pro|pagated through all the&s;e States. And, with a packet to Congre&s;s, Lord Howe &s;ent a letter to his friend Franklin, a member of it, wherein he &s;ays, "Retaining all the earne&s;tne&s;s I ever expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee our differences accommodated, I &s;hall conceive, if I meet with the di&s;po&s;itions in the Colonies which
<PB N="309" REF="018336_0324_0FA5CF1E92D716F0">I was once taught to expect, the mo&s;t flattering hopes of proving &s;erviceable, in the objects of the King's paternal &s;olicitude, by promoting the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of la&s;ting peace and union with the Co|lonies. But if the deep-rooted prejudices of Ame|rica, and the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing her trade from pa&s;&s;ing into foreign channels, mu&s;t keep us &s;till a divided people, I &s;hall, from every private as well as public motive, mo&s;t heartily lament that it is not the moment wherein tho&s;e great objects of my am|bition are to be attained."&mdash;Franklin returned an an&s;wer from Philadelphia July 30, wherein he &s;ays, "The official di&s;patches, to which you refer me, contain nothing more than we had &s;een in the act of Parliament, viz. offers of pardon upon &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; which I am &s;orry to find, as it mu&s;t give your Lord&s;hip pain to be &s;ent &s;o far on &s;o hopele&s;s a bu&s;ine&s;s. Directing pardons to be offered to the Colonies, who are the very parties injured, expre&s;&s;es indeed that opinion of our ignorance, ba&s;ene&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility, which your uninformed and proud na|tion has long been plea&s;ed to entertain of us; but it can have no other effect than that of encrea&s;ing our re&s;entment.

A darling practice of our age, e&s;pecially among high politicians, is to &s;et up rea&s;on above divine revelation; but how will their rules &s;uit in this ca&s;e? One of their noted authors expre&s;ly denies that God had a right to command Abraham to &s;a|crifice his &s;on, with an intent to have it obeyed; and &s;ays, "The command might be given in or|der to convince Abraham, that even his <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> and <HI>integrity,</HI> when not under the direction of <HI>his</HI> under|&s;tanding, might <HI>mi&s;lead</HI> him in the conducting of his actions."

<P N="6">VI. As Canada had long been a dreadful &s;courge to New-England, and the repeating of tho&s;e bloody tragedies was intended by our enemies, amazing ex|ertions were made to prevent it, and to unite that country with ours. Mo&s;t of its inhabitants de&s;ired it, which was a great inducement to this attempt. Therefore the Colonels Ethen Allen and Seth Warner, encouraged thereto by the authority of Connecticut, &s;urprized and took the &s;trong for|tre&s;&s;es of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, May 10, 1775, without the lo&s;s of a man on either &s;ide; whereby above two hundred pieces of cannon, two ve&s;&s;els on Lake-Champlain, and a large quantity of other &s;tores, fell into our hands. All this was done by three hundred and thirty men, chiefly from the State of Vermont. An army followed under Ge|neral Montgomery, and after a clo&s;e &s;iege took St. Johns, at the farther end of &s;aid lake, and ob|tained the city of Montreal, November 13; previ|ous whereto Allen was taken and carried to Europe. In September Colonel Arnold &s;et off from Cam|bridge with eleven hundred men, and marched to Newbury-Port, from whence they &s;ailed into Ken|nebeck river, and went up to its head. And though near a third part of them then returned back, yet the remainder went forward, through a great and terri|ble wilderne&s;s, over rivers, hills and mountains,
<PB N="313" REF="018336_0328_0FA5CF2226AB9CC8">where they &s;aw not the habitation of any human per&s;on for thirty-one days, until they arrived among the Canadians on November 3, by whom they were kindly treated. And the falling &s;nows, &s;evere cold|ne&s;s of the air, and other un&s;peakable difficulties in that northern region, did not hinder their march for|ward, nor the junction of Montgomery's forces with them in December before Quebec, the capital of Canada. The&s;e were &s;ome of the doings of a peo|ple, whom Briti&s;h policy, or rather folly, had de|clared to be cowards and paltroons. Allen and Arnold &s;prang from the de&s;pi&s;ed Rhode-I&s;landers. On the other hand, as General Clinton had &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton with &s;ome forces, General Lee &s;et off by land, and headed him at New-York, in Virginia, and in North and South-Carolina. At length, be|ing reinforced from Britain in June, by Admiral Parker and Lord Cornwallis, a furious attack was made upon the fort on Sullivan's I&s;land, near Charle&s;|ton; but they were defeated, with great damages in their &s;hipping, as well as lo&s;s of their men; and the remainder returned and joined their main body near New-York. General Wa&s;hington with our main army was there, and had erected various for|tifications in that city, and upon Long-I&s;land. And through the land many gloried in what the Ameri|cans had done, and evidently treated their enemies with contempt. But how vain did their glorying &s;oon appear?</P>
<P N="7">VII. OUR army met with a terrible defeat on Long-I&s;land, Augu&s;t 28; were forced to evacuate the city of New-York, September 13; fought on a retreat at the White-Plains; Fort Wa&s;hington was given up November 16; General Lee was ta|ken December 13; and General Wa&s;hington with the &s;mall remnant of our army retreated beyond the
<PB N="314" REF="018336_0329_0FA5CF22ED676DA8">Delaware. Ravi&s;hing of women, and plundering of hou&s;es, by an enraged enemy, was &s;een through all the beautiful country of New-Jer&s;ey, and their cantonments were extended into the towns of Tren|ton. Bordentown and Burlington, on the Delaware; the latter within twenty miles of Philadelphia, over to which a few freezing nights might give them an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age. And if we turn our eyes to the north, we behold General Montgomery &s;lain, December 31, in attempting to &s;torm Quebec. In the &s;pring our army were forced to make a ha&s;ty retreat from thence, being mo&s;t cruelly harra&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time with the &s;mall-pox. And though a co&s;tly fleet to oppo&s;e them was formed on Lake-Champlain, yet it was lo&s;t on October 12. And on December 3 the ene|my, with a powerful force, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rhode-I&s;land, near the heart of New-England. Our fir&s;t army enli&s;ted for eight months, the &s;econd for a year, which was now expiring, and the &s;oldiers were daily returning home. Our paper money had been kept in good credit, until large additional &s;ums were made in September, which le&s;&s;ened its value; and &s;uch va&s;t quantities of goods were taken by our cruizers, and &s;old at public auction, that &s;ugars ro&s;e from five dollars and a third per hundred to ten dol|lars in three months, and the like in other goods. Thus our pro&s;perity &s;eemed likely to de&s;troy us, for if our public credit failed, confu&s;ion and &s;lavery ap|peared the unavoidable con&s;equence. And, to ac|compli&s;h this, if po&s;&s;ible, the enemy counterfeited our paper currency at New-York, and in a clande&s;|tine manner di&s;per&s;ed large quantities of it through the country. Every earthly help failed us; but as our appeal had been to heaven again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ors, many cries now undoubtedly a&s;cended there, &s;aying,
<PB N="315" REF="018336_0330_0FA5CF23B214B1A8"><HI>give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.</HI> And what an an&s;wer thereto was returned!</P>
<P N="8">VIII. WHILE the enemy were expecting in a few days to march in triumph to Philadelphia, on De|cember 26 General Wa&s;hington takes near a thou|&s;and of them, and carries them there as captives. And though a large reinforcement of the enemy marched up to Trenton, and expected to have out General and his forces in the morning, yet the next news they hear of him is at Princeton, a dozen miles off, where he captivates another party of their troops, and is &s;oon gone out of their way, January 2, 1777. The&s;e things terrified the enemy in &s;uch a manner as to call in and confine them at Brun&s;|wick, within &s;ight of their &s;hipping, until &s;pring, when they returned to New-York. Hard attempts indeed were made by &s;ome, to per&s;uade the world that bribery moved the Briti&s;h General thus to act: As if men who could &s;carcely reward their friends for nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices, could outbid their enemies, who had the wealth of both the Indies at command! Such violence will courtiers offer to rea&s;on, rather than to confe&s;s that wherein they deal proudly God is above them, and ea&s;ily turns their coun&s;els into fooli&s;hne&s;s. For though their main army &s;ailed into Che&s;apeak-Bay, and marched from thence to Philadelphia in September, and kept it one winter, yet they got no real advantage thereby. Rather, by dividing their forces, they prepared the way for their own confu&s;ion. Burgoyne had ac|quired a large &s;hare of military &s;kill and fame, in former wars in Europe and in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and thirteen thou&s;and troops were a&s;&s;igned him, be&s;ides &s;avage auxiliaries, to invade our country from Cana|da. Ticonderoga was thought by many to be almo&s;t impregnable, and yet it was de&s;erted by our army,
<PB N="316" REF="018336_0331_0FA5CF2463A08F48">July 5, before it was fully inve&s;ted by the enemy, who pur&s;ued and harra&s;&s;ed our people mo&s;t terribly. And if the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ortre&s;s in the land was thus given up, only upon &s;eeing the manner of the ene|my's approach, how ea&s;ily might they &s;ubdue an open country, and march where they plea&s;ed! Where is the power now that can defend us! A great con|&s;ternation &s;pread through the country; and to pur|&s;ue this advantage with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, moved Burgoyne to take &s;uch methods as effectually de|feated his de&s;igns. Had he returned a little back, and taken the advantage of a water pa&s;&s;age over Lake-George, he might have reached to Fort-Edward much &s;ooner than he did. But fearing an abatement of the ardour of his troops, and of the con&s;ternation of the Americans, he pur&s;ued them in a way attended with great natural impediments, which were much augmented by fallen trees and other ob&s;tacles then thrown in their way. So that by the time he &s;ent out a party towards Benning|ton, with a haughty proclamation to intimidate our countrymen, their &s;pirits were revived, and on Au|gu&s;t 16 they faced the enemy's encampment, and forced their lines with undaunted re&s;olution. His we&s;tern detachment, under St. Ledger, was al&s;o de|feated. And the chief commanders in that depart|ment being removed, and others appointed, in whom our people had confidence, they were all alive in the defence of our country. Ticonderoga was recovered, and every re&s;ource and way of e&s;cape was cut off; &s;o that the haughty General and his army had no way left but to &s;urrender them&s;elves and their weapons into the hands of the people the had greatly abu&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed. This was on October 17. All Europe were a&s;to|ni&s;hed at this event; and one of their mo&s;t power|ful
<PB N="317" REF="018336_0332_0FA5CF251BE2A818">Princes &s;oon made the propo&s;al, which was ac|compli&s;hed on February 6, 1778, of coming into an alliance with the United States of America. Hereby a great turn was made in our affairs, and a door was opened for our deliverance, though not without many other trying &s;cenes.</P>
<P N="9">IX. AS the invaders of our rights called us re|bels, it was very difficult &s;ettling a cartel for the exchange of pri&s;oners; and when that was agreed upon, new difficulties about it &s;oon aro&s;e. When they had taken General Lee, who had been one of their officers, he was not dealt with as our country officers in their hands were; which moved the Con|gre&s;s to order &s;ome retaliation upon their officers in our hands, which cau&s;ed reciprocal complaints, and many terrible actions on both &s;ides. On Ja|nuary 1, 1777, two hundred of our countrymen, who had been pri&s;oners at New-York, were brought to Milford to be exchanged; but they had been &s;o cru|elly u&s;ed, that a very large part of them died before their friends could have notice of it, &s;o as to afford them any relief. Two young men from Middle|borough, and a pious member of a Bapti&s;t church in Attleborough, died there in that manner. And during the war their pri&s;on-&s;hips at New-York de&s;troyed many thou&s;ands of our people, in a much more cruel manner than common murder. There|fore when there was a want of union and vigour in the defence of our country at any time, new at|tempts of the enemy again&s;t us never failed of &s;up|plying that want. They plainly acted like thieves and robbers in all parts of the land. In the morn|ing of May 25, 1778, a party of them came up to Warren, and burnt their meeting-hou&s;e and mini|&s;ter's hou&s;e, with &s;ome others; plundered their goods, and carried off &s;everal of the inhabitants
<PB N="318" REF="018336_0333_0FA5CF260D800A18">that were not in arms, one of whorn was the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church there, who was confined for &s;ome time in a pri&s;on-&s;hip at Newport. On their return they burnt a number of hou&s;es in Bri&s;tol, among which was their Epi&s;copal church. But I mu&s;t not enlarge upon this &s;ubject. Other Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were now &s;ent over, with new offers of pardon, and al&s;o of an enlargement of our privi|leges, if we would &s;ubmit to the Briti&s;h govern|ment. Copies thereof were &s;ent to the Congre&s;s, and to the Governors of the &s;everal States. In an|&s;wer to tho&s;e &s;ent to Governor Trumbull, he well &s;aid, "There was a day when even this &s;tep, from our then acknowledged parent &s;tate, might have been accepted with joy and gratitude; but that day, &s;ir, is pa&s;t irrecoverably. The repeated rejection of our &s;incere and &s;ufficiently humble petitions; the commencement of ho&s;tilities; the inhumanity which has marked the pro&s;ecution of the war on your part in its &s;everal &s;tages; the in&s;olence which di&s;plays it&s;elf on every petty advantage; the cruel|ties which have been exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e unhappy men, whom the fortune of war has thrown into your hands; all the&s;e are in&s;uperable bars to the very idea of concluding a peace with Great-Britain, on any other conditions than the mo&s;t ab&s;olute, perfect independence." However, the va&s;t uncertainty of human affairs mu&s;t yet be largely experienced, be|fore &s;uch a peace could be obtained.</P>
<P N="10">X. GENERAL Howe was recalled, and Clin|ton took his place as Chief Commander; and he evacuated Philadelphia, after they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it near nine months, and marched his army acro&s;s the lower part of New-Jer&s;ey, where General Wa&s;h|ington gave them battle, near Monmouth court|hou&s;e, June 28; when many were &s;lain on both
<PB N="319" REF="018336_0334_0FA5CF279080A3D0">&s;ides, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the air cut off many more. And no &s;ooner had the Briti&s;h troops ar|rived at New-York, than a powerful French fleet appeared upon the coa&s;ts, and came before that place. Briti&s;h fears and American hopes were rai&s;ed hereby; which alternately were as change|able as the winds. The French made no attempt upon New-York; but their &s;peedy arrival at Rhode-I&s;land cau&s;ed con&s;iderable de&s;truction of the Briti&s;h &s;hipping, and rai&s;ed the hopes of our people of &s;eeing that place delivered. Many thou|&s;ands were collected for that purpo&s;e, who, under the command of General Sullivan, landed upon the i&s;land, Augu&s;t 9. But the appearance of the Briti&s;h fleet drew that of France out of the har|bour the &s;ame day; and a terrible &s;torm &s;oon di&s;|per&s;ed and &s;hattered both fleets, &s;o as to prevent any general engagement, or a deliverance to Rhode-I&s;land. In December the capital of Georgia was taken, by a party of the Briti&s;h troops. In 1779 various attempts were made to open a pa&s;&s;age up the North River; but finding it impracticable, a &s;trong party was &s;ent to New-Haven, who &s;lew a number of the inhabitants, and plundered the town, and then went and burnt the beautiful towns of Fairfield and Norwalk. Their malignity was hereby further di&s;covered; but it could not draw the &s;agacious Wa&s;hington from the mountains, while he &s;aw a powerful fleet and army below him. From Georgia a party of their troops marched to the gates of Charle&s;ton; but the arrival of a French fleet on the coa&s;ts turned them back to Savannah; which place our friends attempted to take by &s;torm on October 9, but without &s;ucce&s;s. Thus the hopes of help from our allies were a &s;econd time di&s;appointed. The produce of the field was al&s;o
<PB N="320" REF="018336_0335_0FA5CF281CC4DA58">&s;o much cut &s;hort la&s;t year, that bread was the &s;carce&s;t the beginning of this that we had ever known. And to have the judgment of famine ad|ded to that of the &s;word, would be terrible indeed. But infinite goodne&s;s now gave us an earlier har|ve&s;t than we had ever &s;een, and in a few months our &s;carcity was turned into plenty. And on Oc|tober 24 the enemy went off from Rhode-I&s;land, which was a great relief to this part of the country.</P>
<P N="11">XI. HAVING made &s;ufficient trial of the&s;e north|ern hills, they flattered them&s;elves with much greater advantages in the &s;outhern plains of Ame|rica. And for a while it &s;eemed as if in that way they would have carried all before them. A large force &s;ailed from New-York in December, and though they had a tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;age, yet after &s;ome repairs at Georgia they came and be&s;ieged the capital of South-Carolina; which was com|pelled to yield to them, May 12, 1780. The country then lay open to their ravages; and on Augu&s;t 16 General Gates, who had gained great fame in the north, was entirely defeated in tho&s;e &s;outhern regions. And though a French fleet and army arrived at Rhode-I&s;land July 10, yet none could then tell whether we &s;hould obtain any &s;olid benefit thereby. Our public credit was &s;inking dai|ly, even &s;o that &s;carce any recruits for our army could be obtained, but upon private per&s;onal &s;e|curity. And in November the officers therein con&s;trained the Congre&s;s to promi&s;e them half|pay during life, to prevent their de&s;erting the pub+lic &s;ervice of their country. In June our curren|cy had depreciated &s;o far, that &s;eventy-five paper dollars were readily given for one of &s;ilver. By orders from Congre&s;s, the New-England States then came into &s;uch mea&s;ures as kept it at a &s;tay until
<PB N="321" REF="018336_0336_0FA5CF2BE4704710">February, 1781; when the pouring in va&s;t quan|tities of it from the &s;outhward gave it &s;uch a rapid turn, that it run entirely down in May, &s;o as to &s;top pa&s;&s;ing. Before which General Greene, on March 14, lo&s;t a large number of men in the battle of Guil|ford court-hou&s;e, in North-Carolina; from whence Lord Cornwallis marched with a powerful army into Virginia, where he &s;pread much terror, and laid wa&s;te the country; while the credit of Congre&s;s was &s;unk &s;o low, as &s;carcely to be able to &s;end the lea&s;t &s;upply to General Greene. Yet, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of our enemies, he was made in&s;trumental of an entire recovery of South-Carolina and Geor|gia. A loan of money from France revived our public credit; their troops marched through the land from Rhode-I&s;land to Virginia; the winds and &s;eas, with the hearts of the people, all con|curred together to compel another experienced Briti&s;h General, with a large and powerful army, to yield them&s;elves as pri&s;oners to the de&s;pi&s;ed and much injured Americans, October 19, 1781. The effect of which was, that on November 30, 1782, the Briti&s;h Court fully gave up their claims to the&s;e Thirteen United States; which treaty was to take place as &s;oon as peace was &s;ettled with France and the other powers concerned. Preliminaries for it were &s;igned January 20, and the peace was &s;et|tled in September, 1783. Though before we &s;ay more upon it, we mu&s;t take a further look at things among our&s;elves.</P>

<P N="1">I. OUR A&s;&s;embly for 1777 were empower|ed to frame a new con&s;titution of govern|ment, which was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed or rejected by the next A&s;&s;embly. This was done in the winter after, but without any bill of rights; and an article was in&s;erted therein to adopt their old eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal laws, which cau&s;ed the Bapti&s;t agent and com|mittee to meet at Bo&s;ton February 21, 1778, and to draw up an addre&s;s to our next A&s;&s;embly again&s;t tho&s;e laws, with a prayer that it might be fixed as a fundamental principle of our govern|ment, "That mini&s;ters &s;hall be &s;upported only by Chri&s;t's authority, and not at all by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and &s;ecular force; which impartial liberty has long been claimed and enjoyed by the town of Bo&s;ton." An hundred copies of it were printed and di&s;per&s;ed, and a large number of various denominations &s;ub|&s;cribed it. This gave &s;uch an alarm, that an ear|ne&s;t warning was given to our rulers, in the election

However that con&s;titution was &s;et a&s;ide; and his party in the country, &s;oon after, gave a remarkable di&s;covery of what their ideas were about religion and good order.</P>
<P N="2">II. FOR two young Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters were called to preach in Pepperell, near forty miles northwe&s;t|ward of Bo&s;ton, to whom &s;ix per&s;ons offered them|&s;elves as candidates for bapti&s;m. Therefore, on June 26, they met in a field by a river &s;ide, where prayers were made, and a &s;ermon begun, when the chief of|ficers of the town, with many followers, came and interrupted their wor&s;hip. The owner of the field warned them to depart out of it, if they would not be peaceable; but they refu&s;ed to go. One of the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters de&s;ired them to act like men, if they would not like Chri&s;tians; and reminded them of the liberty of con&s;cience which is generally al|lowed, and even by the powers we were at war with; and began to open the divine warrant therefor: Upon which an officer &s;aid, "Don't quote &s;crip|ture here!" Another of them, who was a commu|nicant in their church, ca&s;t the odious name tory upon one of tho&s;e candidates for bapti&s;m. And he no &s;ooner attempted to di&s;cover the inju&s;tice there|of, than the officer &s;aid, "Hold your tongue, or I'll beat your teeth down your throat!" And a dog was carried into the river and plunged, in evident
<PB N="324" REF="018336_0339_0FA5CF2F182A4F50">contempt of our &s;entiments. A gentleman of the town then invited the Bapti&s;ts to go and hold their meeting at his hou&s;e, which was near another river. They accepted of it, and &s;o went through with their wor&s;hip. At the clo&s;e of which a man was hired with a bowl of liquor to go into the river, and dip another two or three times over; where al&s;o two or three dogs more were plunged. After which three officers of the town came into the hou&s;e where the Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters were, and advi&s;ed them immedi|ately to depart out of what town for their own &s;afe|ty. Being a&s;ked whether their lives would be in danger if they did not depart? no an&s;wer was re|turned. But &s;eeing their temper, the Bapti&s;ts agreed to di&s;per&s;e, and to meet at a di&s;tant place of water; which was performed, and tho&s;e &s;ix per&s;ons were decently baptized, though further abu&s;e was offer|ed at the clo&s;e of it. By direction of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, an account of the&s;e things was publi&s;h|ed in the Independent Chronicle of October 15; which others laid before the Grand Jury of the coun|ty of Middle&s;ex. But they were prevailed with to &s;u&s;pend the matter, until the town &s;hould vindicate them&s;elves. This they attempted in the Chronicle of November 12. It mainly turned upon di&s;put|ing the names of actions, and about the per&s;ons who performed them. The Bapti&s;t account charg|ed the hiring of a per&s;on to go into the water upon an officer, which was &s;aid to be by way of mockery. But &s;ay the town, "The mi&s;repre&s;entation of this affair, and indeed a mo&s;t unpardonable one it is, appears from con&s;idering, that the conduct of &s;aid Bynton and Lawrence was altogether from the in|&s;tigation of a young&s;ter, who promi&s;ed Bynton a bowl of liquor on complying with his propo&s;al; and this was done incon&s;iderately, and not meant as
<PB N="325" REF="018336_0340_0FA5CF2FA8CBBDA8">a piece of religious mockery. The officers of the town had no concern in that affair.&mdash;They were quite oppo&s;ite, and particular care was taken by the officers of the town to prevent <HI>riotous</HI> behaviour, and to maintain peace and <HI>good order.</HI> That we did, as a town, pay particular attention to the conduct of tho&s;e <HI>dangerous</HI> per&s;ons, is a fact we do not wi&s;h to conceal." Now the dangerous per&s;on, who then carried into Pepperell the dangerous practice of quoting &s;cripture to defend liberty of con&s;cience, and of <HI>burying in bapti&s;m,</HI> was I&s;aiah Parker, pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Harvard, who from that day to this is allowed by authority to be regular mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though he is not a State mini&s;ter. Another event, &s;till more dangerous to their way, was as follows.</P>
<P N="3">III. BY the unanimous voice of the Warren A&s;|&s;ociation of September 8, a pamphlet was publi&s;h|ed, which &s;ays, "As the affairs of GOVERNMENT and LIBERTY are the greate&s;t points of controver&s;y now in the world, it certainly is of great impor|tance that our ideas be clear and ju&s;t concerning them. Permit us therefore to offer a few thoughts upon a familiar metaphor, which the Holy Gho&s;t has u&s;ed to illu&s;trate their true nature. In Amos v. 24, he &s;ays, <HI>let judgment run down as waters, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty &s;tream.</HI> From whence we may ob&s;erve,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s are e&s;&s;ential to freedom. When we would repre&s;ent any thing as quite free, we &s;ay it is as free as water. And not only the flow of mercy and grace from God to men, but al&s;o its effects in them, in pro|ducing obedience unto him, are often compared thereto in the word of truth. John iv. 14, vii. 38, Titus ii. 11, 12, iii. 5&mdash;8. This is mo&s;t certain, becau&s;e,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Freedom is not acting at random, but
<PB N="326" REF="018336_0341_0FA5CF305EEDDCA8">by rea&s;on and rule. Tho&s;e who walk after their own lu&s;ts, are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">louds without water, carried about by winds;</HI> or <HI>raging waves of the &s;ea, foaming out their own &s;hame;</HI> while the true SONS OF LIBERTY are like &s;treams which <HI>run down</HI> in a clear and &s;teady chan|nel. David &s;ays, <HI>I will run the way of thy command|ments, when thou &s;halt enlarge my heart. I will walk at liberty, for I &s;eek thy precepts.</HI> Streams and rivers mu&s;t have &s;teady channels to run in; but they that <HI>promi&s;e liberty</HI> while they <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government,</HI> are <HI>wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempe&s;t.</HI> 2 Peter ii. 10&mdash;19.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Though tyranny and li|centiou&s;ne&s;s often make a great noi&s;e, yet govern|ment and liberty are much &s;tronger than they are. The former, like raging waves, da&s;h them&s;elves again&s;t the rocks, and die upon the &s;hore; or like a tempe&s;t, after making &s;ad wa&s;te and deva&s;tation, their &s;trength is gone, and their force is over. While the latter, like a <HI>mighty &s;tream,</HI> carry all be|fore them, and never re&s;t till they can get through or over all ob&s;tacles put in their way.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Streams and rivers are of great u&s;e, and cau&s;e a con&s;tant flow of refre&s;hment and ble&s;&s;ings wherever they come; &s;o does the exerci&s;e anD admini&s;tration of judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s, among all people that enjoy them. Hence,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The command of heaven is, <HI>let them run down:</HI> Put no ob&s;truction in their way. No, rather be in earne&s;t to remove every thing that hinders their free cour&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The context plainly &s;hews, that a main ob&s;truction to the&s;e great ble&s;|&s;ings among the people then &s;poken to, was their a&s;&s;uming a power to govern religion, in&s;tead of be|ing governed by it. True religion is a voluntary obedience unto God. And the great de&s;ign of all ordinances and acts of wor&s;hip towards him, is that thereby we may obtain pardon and clean&s;ing, with
<PB N="327" REF="018336_0342_0FA5CF3174612630">direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to behave as we ought to|wards our fellow men. But in&s;tead of this, tho&s;e people added their own inventions to divine in&s;ti|tutions, and &s;ub&s;tituted their acts of devotion to|wards God, in the place of a righteous practice to|wards men; or for a cover to their contrary con|duct: And they would fain have been thought very religious, although they turned <HI>judgment into worm|wood, hated him that rebuked in the gate, and abhorred him who &s;pake uprightly.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="4">IV. INFINITE wi&s;dom di&s;po&s;ed things in &s;uch a manner, as to give a keener edge to this remon|&s;trance than could be fore&s;een by man. For an ex|tract from the la&s;t election &s;ermon, and al&s;o from Chauncy again&s;t Chandler, was added to the above ob&s;ervations, with &s;ome remarks thereon. At the &s;ame time our army on Rhode-I&s;land &s;aw &s;uch danger of being &s;urrounded by the Briti&s;h fleet, that they wi&s;ely came off with all their &s;tores, in the night after Augu&s;t 30. Chauncy imagined that this defeat might be turned to mini&s;terial advan|tage; and therefore at his next lecture, when many of our rulers were pre&s;ent, he delivered a di&s;cour&s;e from the &s;eventh of Jo&s;hua, wherein he repre&s;ented that one of the <HI>accur&s;ed things</HI> which cau&s;ed that de|feat, was their neglect of making a new law to help mini&s;ters about their &s;alaries, which the deprecia|tion of our currency had greatly le&s;&s;ened. This &s;er|mon was &s;oon printed and di&s;per&s;ed in the country. And in the Continental Journal of October 8 it was highly commended, and its author al&s;o; and then it was &s;aid, "Although the General A&s;&s;embly has now been &s;itting for &s;ome time, no motion (as I can learn) has as yet been made, or is likely to be made, for this purpo&s;e.&mdash;Are the clergy then to &s;ub|mit to this treatment? Are they as an order, and the
<PB N="328" REF="018336_0343_0FA5CF31E2405F20">only order of men in the community, to remain &s;ub|jected to <HI>inju&s;tice and fraud!"</HI> Now it was &s;o or|dered, that the above pa&s;&s;ages in the Bapti&s;t pam|phlet were in&s;erted in the Independent Chronicle the &s;ame day, in the &s;ame &s;treet in Bo&s;ton. By which means the &s;ame author was declaring to the world in one paper, that all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments were of infinite damage to the cau&s;e of God and true religion; and in another, that the want of further exertions in that way was an accur&s;ed thing, which cau&s;ed the defeat of our army. And what could be done in &s;uch a ca&s;e? In the Bo&s;ton Gazette of No|vember 2 it was declared, that &s;aid Bapti&s;t pam|phlet "Exhibited only a compound of <HI>ignorance, impudence and abu&s;e.</HI>" And their refu&s;al to comply with mini&s;terial demands, was declared to be a u&s;ing force again&s;t them; upon which it was &s;aid, "I cannot conceive that it is more proper to u&s;e force again&s;t mini&s;ters than for them; yet this is the &s;ub|ject from which a &s;et of men, who have occa&s;ioned more di&s;turbance and damage to this State than would be repaired by all the money which &s;elling them all for &s;laves would produce, derive their im|portance." And the &s;ecular arm was called for to puni&s;h them. This was &s;o far from being obtain|ed, that the pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton was called to preach the election &s;ermon there, May 26, 1779, in which the difference be|tween church and State was well de&s;cribed, with the importance of keeping them entirely di&s;tinct; and it was printed and &s;ent through the State by order of authority. However our opponents were far from yielding this point.</P>
<P N="5">V. DELEGATES from the &s;everal towns, elect|ed entirely for the purpo&s;e of framing a new con|&s;titution of government, met on September 1, and
<PB N="329" REF="018336_0344_0FA5CF32A26FB450">cho&s;e a large committee to make a draught for their con&s;ideration, and adjourned. When they met again, they took in hand a bill of rights which was laid before them. The third article therein was to give civil rulers power in religious matters, which occa&s;ioned much debate; until a Bapti&s;t member moved to have that article re|committed. The motion was concurred with, and he was elected the Chairman of a committee of &s;e|ven upon that article. Five of them were great politicians, and they brought in a new draught, which, after warm debates, was pa&s;&s;ed by a ma|jority, November 10, as it now &s;tands in our con|&s;titution. In order to obtain this vote, it was a&s;&s;erted that there never was any per&s;ecution in this land; but that what had been &s;o called were only ju&s;t puni&s;hments upon di&s;orderly per&s;ons, and di&s;turbers of the public peace. And the Bapti&s;ts were accu&s;ed of &s;ending their agent to Philadel|phia in 1774, with a fal&s;e memorial of grievances, in order to break the union of the Colonies. Sharp debates were cau&s;ed hereby for &s;ome time; but the fir&s;t volume of our hi&s;tory was brought in and laid upon the table, which &s;ilenced the fir&s;t part of tho&s;e declamations, and their agent being inform|ed of the latter part, publi&s;hed &s;aid third article in the Chronicle of December 2, with rea&s;ons again&s;t the power claimed in the middle part of it; and then named his accu&s;ers concerning the Philadelphia affair, and charged them with a vio|lation of their promi&s;e made there; and chal|lenged them to a fair hearing before any proper judges. This was &s;o far from being granted, that a long reviling piece, full of glaring deceit, came out in the Chronicle of February 10, 1780; which was &s;oon after re-printed in the Providence Gazette,
<PB N="330" REF="018336_0345_0FA5CF336CCCCBB8">where the appeal it pretended to an&s;wer was not known. It accu&s;ed the Bapti&s;t members of the Convention of <HI>bitterne&s;s and rage</HI> again&s;t their mi|ni&s;ters, e&s;pecially for comparing them to the &s;ons of Eli; and to prove that they were not worthy of that charge, the writer &s;ays, "Eli's &s;ons were not to blame for taking that part of the offerings which the law allowed them, but for the <HI>illegal man|ner</HI> in which they took it." Very true; and the only cau&s;e of the bitterne&s;s and rage now di&s;covered again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, was their refu&s;al to counte|nance &s;uch an <HI>illegal</HI> and wicked <HI>manner</HI> of proceed|ing. An anonymous Bapti&s;t writer began &s;ome publications in the Chronicle, again&s;t the power of taxation claimed in the above&s;aid third article, about the time that the con&s;titution was fini&s;hed. In an&s;wer to whom a writer appeared in the Con|tinental Journal of March 9, &s;aying, "The wick|ed enemies of our civil and &s;acred rights are like the troubled &s;ea, who&s;e waters cannot re&s;t, but be|ing driven by furious winds are continually ca&s;ting up mire and dirt.&mdash;There is a certain junto com|po&s;ed of di&s;gui&s;ed tories, Briti&s;h emi&s;&s;aries, profane and licentious Dei&s;ts, avaricious worldlings, di&s;af|fected &s;ectaries, and furious blind bigots, who had much rather overturn and de&s;troy the Common|wealth, than not to have the gratification of their own humour." And he &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf <HI>Irenaeus, a member of Convention.</HI> The Bapti&s;t agent and committee met April 6, and publi&s;hed and appeal to the people of this State, again&s;t the taxing power for religious teachers claimed in the new con&s;titution, then &s;ent out for their acceptance or rejection. But their opponents were &s;o much concerned about it, that no le&s;s than three different pieces again&s;t the Bapti&s;t agent were publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton papers
<PB N="331" REF="018336_0346_0FA5CF34E35D48A0">in the month of May, to two of which the writers &s;ub&s;cribed their names, which had not been done before. One of them was a follows: The fir&s;t part of the third article in our bill of rights &s;ays, "The happine&s;s of a people, and the good order and pre&s;ervation of civil government, e&s;&s;entially de|pend upon piety, religion and morality, and the&s;e cannot be generally diffu&s;ed through a community but by the in&s;titution of the public wor&s;hip of God, and of public in&s;tructions in piety, religion and mo|rality;" which part &s;aid agent, in his publication of December 2, declared a full concurrence with. Upon which a mini&s;ter of Roxbury, in the Chro|nicle of May 18, &s;aid, "Mr. Backus, by inadver|tently <HI>concurring fully</HI> with this part, gave up the whole cau&s;e for which he was agent." This he en|deavoured to prove, by fixing an empha&s;is upon the word <HI>e&s;&s;entially,</HI> and then ob&s;erving that government <HI>can exi&s;t</HI> without Chri&s;tianity. And his evident de|&s;ign was to &s;ink the credit of the agent among his brethren, in order to terminate this controver&s;y. But the agent an&s;wered all tho&s;e three publications in one paper, June 26, when he ob&s;erved, that "No government could ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed without ap|peals to the Deity; the knowledge of whom is as much greater under the go&s;pel than it is in Pagar countries, as <HI>&s;eeing</HI> in day-light is above <HI>feeling</HI> in the night, Mat. v. 14, Acts xvii. 27. And men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an have no more RIGHT to <HI>add</HI> go God's laws about his wor&s;hip, and to judge the con&s;ciences of &s;uch as refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to their <HI>additions,</HI> than they have POWER to cau&s;e the <HI>day-&s;pring to know his place,</HI> Job xxxviii. 12, Luke i. 78. And is not go&s;pel light e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>good order</HI> of govern|ment, although government <HI>can exi&s;t</HI> without it!" And notwith&s;tanding their third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;ly ex|cludes
<PB N="332" REF="018336_0347_0FA5CF359DE76158">all &s;ubordination of one religious &s;ect to ano|ther, yet he ob&s;erved, that &s;ince it was pa&s;&s;ed, four Bapti&s;t brethren had been impri&s;oned, and a fifth had a cow taken from him, for no other cau&s;e than a refu&s;al to acknowledge &s;uch &s;ubordination. Two of them were of Bridgwater, the others were of Lan|ca&s;ter. Tho&s;e of Bridgwater were threatened this month with impri&s;onment for another mini&s;terial tax; but it was prevented in the following manner. One of them was lieutenant of a company of militia; and, as the public credit was &s;unk &s;o low as to render it exceeding difficult to rai&s;e recruits for our army, news came to him that the town had cho&s;en him a member of a &s;pecial committee to procure a number of men that were wanted, which news came ju&s;t after the collector had threatened to carry him to gaol for &s;aid tax, and prevented it. But a third Bapti&s;t from Lanca&s;ter was impri&s;oned at Worce&s;|ter, June 26, where two of his brethren had been from April 12, and they were confined there un|til fall.</P>
<P N="6">VI. YET when the new con&s;titution took place, October 25, 1780, it was &s;aid, "We may rely that the pre&s;ent government will do all it fairly can, by authority and example, to an&s;wer the end of its in|&s;titution, that the members of this Commonwealth may <HI>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all</HI> GODLINESS as well as <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> and our liberty never be ju&s;tly re|proached as licentiou&s;ne&s;s. I know there is diver|&s;ity of &s;entiment re&s;pecting the extent of civil pow|er in religious matters. In&s;tead of entering into the di&s;pute, may I be allowed from the warmth of my heart to recommend, where con&s;cience is plead|ed on both &s;ides, mutual candour and love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cooper's &s;ermon, p. 37, 38.</NOTE>." And in the Bo&s;ton Gazette of February 5, 1781, it was
<PB N="333" REF="018336_0348_0FA5CF365D24FBB8">&s;aid, "La&s;t &s;ummer, a certain rich man, in the county of Plymouth, altered his principles with re|gard to bapti&s;m, was re-baptized, and admitted in|to Mr. Backus's church in Middleborough. Some neighbours were &s;o uncharitable and cen&s;orious as to imagine that this per&s;on changed his religion in order to be freed from mini&s;terial taxes.&mdash;However it remained a que&s;tion in the minds of many people, by what means his e&s;tate could be exempted legal|ly? ina&s;much as they verily &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Backus has declared he would give no more cer|tificates to any body what&s;over, always pleading, as they received it, that the practice was contrary to the dictates of his con&s;cience. Neverthele&s;s, contrary to the expectation of every one, our a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors have been furni&s;hed with a certificate.&mdash;I hope the public will put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truc|tion upon the late remarkable conduct of our agent for a thou&s;and &s;ouls; that his laudable example will be punctually imitated by all others of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, and thereby fini&s;h one part of the tedious di&s;pute which has long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted." This paper was left for him three days after, by a noted lawyer, at a hou&s;e he was to preach at in Bridgwater. From thence he went into Bo&s;ton, and demanded the name of the writer of that libel. This was re|fu&s;ed by the printer, though he was ready to pub|li&s;h an an&s;wer to it: An an&s;wer was therefore left, upon an expre&s;s promi&s;e from the printer, that he would not publi&s;h a reply without the writer's name. Yet this promi&s;e was violated on March 5, without &s;o much as &s;ending the reply to the agent. He was however &s;o unwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to &s;end another piece, which was publi&s;hed May 7, wherein &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions were &s;o turned, as to ca&s;t the printer's faults upon the public. From hence three or four revil|ing
<PB N="334" REF="018336_0349_0FA5CF37258EE610">pieces were publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton papers again&s;t him; in one of which he was threatened with a halter and the gallows. Yet for all this noi&s;e, they had no other foundation than a line that was given July 12, 1780, which certified that a man in Pembroke was a baptized member of the fir&s;t Bap|ti&s;t church in Middleborough, &s;igned only by their pa&s;tor, at a time when no certificate law had been in force for &s;ome months, and never could be again, according to &s;aid third article, which excludes all &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect to another. And the line given did not an&s;wer to any law ever made in this government, from its foundation to this day. It may therefore be proper in this place to give a di&s;tinct account of what the faith and order of the&s;e Bapti&s;t churches are, again&s;t whom &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion has been made.</P>
<P N="7">VII. IN general their faith and practice come the neare&s;t to that of the fir&s;t planters of New-England, of any churches now in the land, ex|cepting in the &s;ingle article of &s;prinkling infants. In particular they believe,

"WE are now to part a&s;under, and the Lord knoweth whether ever I &s;hall live to &s;ee your faces again: But whether he has appointed it or not, I charge you, before God and his ble&s;&s;ed angels, to follow me no further than I follow Chri&s;t. And if God &s;hall reveal any thing to you by any other in&s;trument of his, be as ready to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth by my mini&s;try; for I am very confident that he has more truth and light yet to break forth out of his holy word. He took occa&s;ion al&s;o mi&s;erably to bewail the &s;tate and con|dition of the reformed churches, who were come to a period in religion, and would go no further than the in&s;truments of their reformation. As for example, the Lutherans could not be drawn to go beyond what Luther &s;aw; for whatever part of God's will he has further imparted and revealed to Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it. And &s;o you &s;ee the Calvini&s;ts, they &s;tick where he left them; a mi&s;ery much to be lamented, for though they were precious &s;hining lights in their times, yet God had not revealed his whole will to them; and were they now living, they would be as ready to embrace further light as what they had received. Here (&s;ays Win&s;low) he put us in mind of our

Such were the noble &s;entiments and &s;olemn charge of Mr. Robin&s;on, that eminent father of the plant|ers of New-England. To which I &s;hall annex a caution he gave, in his preface to a defence of their cau&s;e ten years before. Says he, "I de&s;ire the Chri&s;tian reader to take knowledge of this one thing, that as the pretence of zeal in forward mi|ni&s;ters again&s;t all corruptions is a thick mi&s;t, hold|ing the eyes of many well-minded people from &s;ee|ing the truth, &s;o the per&s;on with whom I now par|ticularly deal tru&s;ts to this in&s;inuation above all others, conveying him&s;elf under this colour into the hearts of the &s;imple, and hereby making way mo&s;t effectually not only for his coun&s;els and ad|verti&s;ements, for the quenching of their affections towards the truth, but al&s;o for his idle gue&s;&s;es and <HI>likelihoods</HI> (vol. 1, p. 7) with &s;uch <HI>per&s;onal</HI> compari|&s;ons and imputations as his book is &s;tored with, to alienate mens hearts from it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. DR. Mayhew publi&s;hed two &s;ermons, in the beginning of 1763, from tho&s;e words, <HI>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</HI> From whence, after laying down many ju&s;t ob&s;ervations, he endeavours to prove, that the Lord is good to all the different ranks, orders or &s;pecies of his intelligent and &s;en&s;itive creatures; and good and kind to <HI>all</HI> the <HI>individuals</HI> of which the&s;e &s;pecies con&s;i&s;t. He allows that the terms <HI>all, every,</HI> and the like, are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e in &s;cripture, and that there are many places which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o under&s;tood; but de|nies any limitation here, becau&s;e God's goodne&s;s is perfect and infinite, as well as his other perfections. And beginning with a greater number, and coming down to a le&s;&s;er, he at la&s;t comes to the lowe&s;t in|dividual; and if any held that he was not good to that individual, Mayhew &s;ays, "I think you &s;hould paraphra&s;e the text thus, the Lord is good to all <HI>but one,</HI> and his tender mercies are over all his works, <HI>excepting a &s;ingle</HI> in&s;ignificant creature, which either e&s;capes his notice, or at which he is angry,
<PB N="339" REF="018336_0354_0FA5CF3EAF822F88">and &s;o makes it mi&s;erable, though it neither has nor is capable of offending him." And he goes on to ob&s;erve, that John &s;ays, <HI>God is</HI> LOVE; and then &s;ays, "It is worthy of particular remark, that though God is infinitely wi&s;e and powerful, &amp;c. as well as good, yet he is never &s;tiled in &s;cripture <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> or <HI>power</HI> in the ab&s;tract, as he is here &s;tiled LOVE. Perfect goodne&s;s, love it&s;elf, is his very e&s;|&s;ence, in a peculiar &s;en&s;e; immea&s;urable, immutable, univer&s;al and everla&s;ting LOVE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said &s;ermons, p. 39, 44.</NOTE>." Again &s;ays he, "Nothing was prior, not even the exi&s;tence of God, to his <HI>will</HI> to be good.&mdash;God is then not only eternally, <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> and e&s;&s;entially, but infinitely or perfectly good. And if &s;o, then equally, univer|&s;ally, and immutably good in all times and places." Nece&s;&s;ity therefore he a&s;cribes to the will of God, though his party &s;trenuou&s;ly deny that it can be con&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of our wills. And he had before a&s;&s;erted, "That there is no medium betwixt God's being actually kind and merciful to all, and his being po&s;itively cruel and unmerciful to &s;ome<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 35, 46</NOTE>." And to give his ideas of the atone|ment, he &s;ays, "Infinite goodne&s;s it&s;elf, con&s;idered in connexion with infinite wi&s;dom, requires that order, and the highe&s;t veneration for the maje&s;ty of God, his laws and government, &s;hould be pre&s;erv|ed among&s;t all his rea&s;onable creatures. Their own good e&s;&s;entially depends upon it. And this impor|tant end is <HI>mo&s;t effectually</HI> attained by the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, by whom <HI>we have received the atonement.</HI> We are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tured in the holy &s;criptures, that God forgives the &s;ins of men through this great &s;acrifice interven|ing, <HI>rather</HI> than without any, not becau&s;e he is in his own nature deficient in goodne&s;s, or not perfect|ly merciful, but becau&s;e he is infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> as well
<PB N="340" REF="018336_0355_0FA5CF3FB4147948">as merciful.&mdash;There was a fitne&s;s and congruity in it, as the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t method for &s;aving &s;inful men, without any kind of reference to that com|mon but yet <HI>&s;trange</HI> &s;uppo&s;ition, of divine <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> being entirely di&s;tinct from divine goodne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 64.</NOTE>." It is to be noted, that here he owns that he rejects the <HI>common</HI> &s;entiments of our fathers; and &s;ays he, "I &s;eriou&s;ly declare, that if I were to form my concep|tions of God's moral character, by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es as I have &s;ometimes heard and read, and &s;uch as were, <HI>by many,</HI> thought to be truly <HI>evangelical,</HI> in|&s;tead of thinking him really good to ALL, and his tender mercies over ALL his works, e&s;&s;entially good, and infinitely the be&s;t of beings, I could not but conclude him to be <HI>infinitely</HI> more <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>cruel</HI> than any other being in the univer&s;e!" And he at length ventures to &s;ay of infants, "To &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;in of Adam and Eve is or can be &s;o imputed to them, as to render them <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> liable to eternal mi&s;ery, without any offence of their own, is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all ab&s;urdities." And to hold that any of the human race are not cho&s;en in Chri&s;t to eternal life, is a doctrine which he rejects in the &s;ame manner; after which he &s;ays, "If, therefore, my brethren, you know of any particular &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity (&s;o called) two or three of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing and leading principles of which, and the ba&s;is on which the whole re&s;ts, are plainly and certainly repugnant to the doctrine of God's <HI>univer&s;al</HI> goodne&s;s, and his tender mercies over all his works; you may be certain that &s;uch &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem is fal&s;e; ab&s;olutely and wholly fal&s;e, &s;o far as it has any connexion with or dependence upon tho&s;e principles<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 50, 62, 63, 83, 85.</NOTE>." He allows that there will be a future puni&s;hment to the wicked, but leaves the
<PB N="341" REF="018336_0356_0FA5CF412F7CF798">words concerning it undefined; and concludes with mentioning, that in the other world the meaning of that pa&s;&s;age in the Revelation will be more clearly opened than we can conceive of it here, that "<HI>Every creature</HI> which is in <HI>heaven,</HI> and on the <HI>earth,</HI> and <HI>under the earth,</HI> and &s;uch as are in the <HI>&s;ea,</HI> and <HI>all that are in them,</HI> heard I &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."</P>
<P N="2">II. THE reader may now judge, whether this author had not a de&s;ign again&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t important principles of the Prote&s;tant reformed &s;y&s;|tem of Chri&s;tianity, as it had long been profe&s;&s;ed in this and other countries. Yet becau&s;e Mr. Cleave|land repre&s;ented his &s;ermons in that light, in his e&s;|&s;ay to defend that &s;y&s;tem, Dr. Mayhew called it "A defamatory libel;" and &s;aid to Cleaveland, "Can you po&s;&s;ibly think it became you, an ob&s;cure per|&s;on from another Province, and one &s;o unlettered as you are, an out-ca&s;t from the college to which you was a di&s;grace?&mdash;Did you not &s;how the utmo&s;t a&s;|&s;urance, in thus &s;etting up your little &s;elf?&mdash;Poor, unhappy man! You doubtle&s;s thought to emerge from your ob&s;curity, and to appear as a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence, by this vain attempt.&mdash;It is as much <HI>beneath me</HI> to play the <HI>critic</HI> on &s;uch a perform|ance as yours, as it would be particularly to expo&s;e the vanity of your critici&s;ms on my &s;ermons.&mdash;But I will proceed to the main bu&s;ine&s;s of this letter, which is to &s;et your <HI>fal&s;hood</HI> and iniquitous pro|ceedings, with reference to my &s;ermons, in <HI>&s;ome order before your eyes;</HI> and to admini&s;ter the reproof and correction which you de&s;erve, or rather a <HI>part</HI> there|of. For it is only they that hold the <HI>&s;word of public ju&s;tice,</HI> that can legally puni&s;h &s;uch wickedne&s;s to the <HI>extent</HI> of its demerits. Your <HI>villainy</HI> in this
<PB N="342" REF="018336_0357_0FA5CF41AF14B048">affair appears written, as one may &s;ay, even upon your forehead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mayhew's letter of reproof, 1764, p. 4&mdash;6.</NOTE>." And his whole letter of forty|nine pages is in this &s;train; which in&s;tead of univer|&s;al goodne&s;s, di&s;covers how &s;uch men would treat their opponents, if their power was equal to their wills. A &s;ight of the&s;e things moved the Pre&s;ident and Corporation of the college, who expelled Cleave|land, to give him the title of A. M. the &s;ame year. Yet when Mayhew died two years after, Chauncy reflected upon Cleaveland (as before ob&s;erved, p. 229) and called him an ob&s;cure per&s;on without re|putation. And to this day the per&s;ons of tho&s;e two men are held in &s;uch admiration by multitudes, that they are much &s;ooner di&s;turbed at hearing their errors expo&s;ed, than at hearing their MAKER bla&s;|phemed! while they are highly plea&s;ed with &s;eeing eminent mini&s;ters of oppo&s;ite principles treated with a high degree of abu&s;e and contempt, as appears in what follows.</P>
<P N="3">III. ALL e&s;tabli&s;hments of wor&s;hip by human laws, that ever were erected under the Chri&s;tian name, were built upon calling the covenant in Gen. xvii. the covenant of grace. Yet our excellent Ed|wards was &s;eparated from his dear flock at North|ampton, only for in&s;i&s;ting upon a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of &s;anctifying grace in order for full communion. (Page 191.) From thence he went and &s;ettled at Stockbridge, on the we&s;t borders of our State; where his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have endeavoured to pur&s;ue his plan of reformation. A con&s;iderable number of mini&s;ters, in various parts of the land, have al&s;o laboured in the &s;ame cau&s;e. About the clo&s;e of 1768, Dr. Jo&s;eph Bellamy publi&s;hed a &s;mall piece upon the half-way covenant; which was &s;oon an|&s;wered, and he wrote not le&s;s than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x pamphlets
<PB N="343" REF="018336_0358_0FA5CF4266C8E4E0">upon the covenant, to prove that a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith was a nece&s;&s;ary term of communion in the church, and of being active in bapti&s;m. The piece on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, mentioned in p. 268, was occa&s;ioned hereby. And within &s;ix years above twenty pamphlets were written by different par|ties upon this &s;ubject, through the country from New-Jer&s;ey to Bo&s;ton. The name of a half-way covenant was di&s;owned by all the&s;e writers, and their controver&s;y turned entirely upon the que&s;tion, whether a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith ought to be re|quired of communicants, or not? For both parties agreed that none &s;hould be active them&s;elves in bapti&s;m, but &s;uch as had a right to come to the other ordinance; and they were as unable to &s;ettle this matter as Stoddard and Mather were &s;eventy years before. (Page 33, 34.) How to reconcile divine &s;overeignty with human liberty, and effica|cious grace with the u&s;e of means for conver&s;ion, were al&s;o que&s;tions that they had long and tedious debates upon. At length a &s;ingular act of di&s;ci|pline at Stockbridge &s;eemed to give the other par|ty an occa&s;ion, and it was eagerly improved, to give them as bad a <HI>thru&s;t with their horns,</HI> as ever was given by any bulls in Ba&s;han. It was as follows. Tho&s;e who have &s;een the nature of original &s;in, cannot tell how to keep up the idea of childrens being born in the covenant of grace, without &s;ome regard to grace in their parents. And in the &s;ame chapter where the unbelieving con&s;ort is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> by the believer, a widow is required to marry <HI>only in the Lord.</HI> Therefore, becau&s;e a young widow in Stockbridge church married an immo|ral profane man, in the beginning of 1777, &s;he was cen&s;ured and excluded from their communion. This occa&s;ioned the calling of a Council in Janua|ry,
<PB N="344" REF="018336_0359_0FA5CF43270C1800">1779, which was adjourned to May, and from thence to October, when they ju&s;tified the church in that act. The man who married &s;aid widow was from Connecticut; and he got a learned mini&s;ter from thence to plead his cau&s;e in the la&s;t of tho&s;e Councils, who was &s;on to the ruler that &s;ent a man to pri&s;on forty years ago, for preaching the go&s;pel. (Page 165.) As his client was not relieved by that Council, he publi&s;hed his plea for him, which has pa&s;&s;ed through three or four editions. It was an|&s;wered from Stockbridge, upon which he publi&s;hed a larger piece in 1780, intituled, Letters of friend|&s;hip; which being replied to, he in 1781 gave what he called a gentle reprimand. And in 1782 the&s;e three pieces were printed in one at Bo&s;ton. Their evident de&s;ign was to relieve that woman, to pre|vent divi&s;ion among their mini&s;ters, and to keep up the u&s;e of force for their &s;upport; all which it is &s;aid are accompli&s;hed thereby. Be that as it may, it is certain that much deceit and cruelty have been u&s;ed in this affair. Many would limit the word per&s;ecution to corporal puni&s;hments; which is &s;o oppo&s;ite to truth, that <HI>reviling</HI> and <HI>mockery</HI> contain a great and <HI>cruel</HI> part of it, Mat. v. 11, Heb. xi. 36. Colonel Gardiner, who was converted &s;ixty-five years ago, declared that "He would much rather have marched up to a battery of the enemy's cannon, than have been obliged &s;o continually as he was to face &s;uch artillery as this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gardiner's life, p. 35.</NOTE>." Yet in order to carry his point, this advocate advanced a parable of a church who refu&s;ed to allow a brother therein to marry a woman he dearly loved, becau&s;e not a gracious per&s;on; and advi&s;ed him to marry a mem|ber of theirs that was &s;ound in the faith, which is mo&s;t &s;hockingly de&s;cribed; and then &s;aying of her
<PB N="345" REF="018336_0360_0FA5CF43E07595E8">per&s;on, "As to &s;ome trifles, which a carnal man would object to, it becomes you, as a &s;piritual man, to make no objection. It is true, &s;he is of a mean family, and a very weak under&s;tanding; &s;he is pee|vi&s;h and fretful to the highe&s;t degree; her &s;hape is &s;emicircular; &s;he is what the world calls mon&s;trous ugly; every feature is adapted to mortify carnal de&s;ires, which is much better than to have them gratified; &s;he is the queen of &s;luts, and without any polite education. But &s;he has grace, SAVING GRACE; &s;he is regenerated; let your grace wed with hers, and a <HI>&s;weet bride</HI> &s;he will be. Moreover, <HI>&s;he is pa&s;t the flower of her age,</HI> and we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>need &s;o requires</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, p. 29.</NOTE>." Now is it po&s;&s;ible to dre&s;s up a church and &s;cripture phra&s;es in a more odious and &s;candal|ous manner than is here done! Yet in his repri|mand, which he calls gentle, he in&s;inuates that for any to be offended at it argues guilt; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, "It was expre&s;ly declared that it is to be ap|plied only as <HI>truth</HI> applies it." But when we look into his plea, we find him &s;aying, "Let the follow|ing parable apply where it <HI>will</HI> apply<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plea, p. 27, Reprimand, p. 15.</NOTE>." Truth cannot apply it to any church upon earth; but his <HI>will</HI> has publi&s;hed the names of thirteen mini&s;ters in that plea, more worthy than him&s;elf, for the world to laugh at as much as they <HI>will.</HI> And this is doubtle&s;s the chief rea&s;on of its circulating &s;o ex|ten&s;ively. But how mean and &s;piteful is it to treat the word grace in this manner! Affixing the word to the covenant of circumci&s;ion, where God never put it, is the &s;ource of that difficulty at Stockbridge. The words <HI>&s;anctified</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> in 1 Cor. vii. 14, are both of a kind, and the latter the effect of the form|er; and their meaning may be a&s;certained by 1 Tim. iv. 5. But if we mu&s;t go to the law for the mean|ing
<PB N="346" REF="018336_0361_0FA5CF44C5769328">of the world holy there, the &s;ame word in the law is given as the rea&s;on why they &s;hould not marry with unholy per&s;ons, Deut. vii. 3, 6. Every &s;oul therefore will be &s;elf-condemned that affixes the name grace to the convenant of circumci&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time cen&s;ures the church at Stockbridge for attempting to act con&s;i&s;tently upon it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. HIS &s;econd pamphlet is directed to mini|&s;ters who had e&s;&s;ayed to withdraw from the major party in the country; to whom he applies the apo&s;|tolic warning, <HI>beware of dogs, beware of the conci&s;ion:</HI> Which warning was levelled again&s;t tho&s;e who held to the covenant of circumci&s;ion after it was out of date, and could not bear to quit all <HI>confidence in the fle&s;h,</HI> Phil. iii. 2, 3.

But in the Bo&s;ton edition this pa&s;&s;age is left out; and &s;ome mini&s;ters are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccu&s;ed of renouncing communion with others, in con&s;e|quence of that affair at Stockbridge.

It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that a member of the church in Stock|bridge detected &s;aid advocate in &s;everal violations of truth, as to matters of fact there. But in&s;tead of any hone&s;t retraction, he &s;aid of that member, "Where he is known, he can perhaps hurt no man's character, either with his tongue or pen; and it is a que&s;tion whether, at this period of time, he can hurt his own."

That is, the man he points to, being of the Convention who formed our new con&s;titution, la|boured to exclude the u&s;e of violence from it in &s;upporting religious teachers. And his character was &s;uch as to be freely cho&s;en one of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Senators in May, 1781. How then did his opponent <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government?</HI></P>

And how much was that the ca&s;e in this di&s;pute! The mo&s;t puzzling argument of the advocate for the profane man, was declaring that by bapti&s;m he was in the church, and ought to have been di&s;ciplined, rather than his wife for marrying of him. And in 1783 the &s;ame author publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the
<PB N="348" REF="018336_0363_0FA5CF46346CFD70">Bapti&s;ts, wherein he repre&s;ents the covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion to be &s;uch an ample charter of church privileges, that it would even have been an im|peachment of the &s;acred character, or reflexion up|on the perfections of God, to expect an expre&s;s de&s;cription of who were the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m in the new te&s;tament.

Yet the above&s;aid pleader has the effrontery to &s;ay to his opponents, "You tell us, gentlemen, that &s;ome of us do not agree with you, in our notions of the terms of church communion, or admi&s;&s;ion of church members.&mdash;But&mdash;no mortal knows, or can know, who has grace or who has not.&mdash;Let us &s;peculate and di&s;pute as long as we plea&s;e, we mu&s;t practi&s;e alike, or we cannot practi&s;e at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters of friend&s;hip, p. 20.</NOTE>."

They are in covenant with death, and agreement with hell, and from thence think to &s;ecure them&s;elves; and they <HI>&s;cornfully</HI> &s;light all warnings of future danger.

This I take to be a &s;criptural gla&s;s, and return our opponents compliment upon it. Says he, "Why do the letters of friend&s;hip offend them, &s;ince it is &s;o expre&s;ly premi&s;ed that no per&s;on is pointed at in them un|le&s;s ju&s;tly characterized?

And &s;ince his zeal has been &s;o great for the relief of one cen&s;ured woman, let him appear for another nearer home. For a wo|man of good character, in the head county of his own State, was cen&s;ured in 1781, and excommuni|cated
<PB N="350" REF="018336_0365_0FA5CF47B0CB1E90">in 1783, by a mini&s;ter who is a fellow of Yale college, for no other crime than refraining from coming to the Lord's table with &s;uch as hold the Lord's &s;upper to be a converting ordinance.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THIS may lead us to take a further view of their claims of power over the churches. About twenty years ago, a mini&s;ter who was a fellow of Yale college publi&s;hed a pamphlet to prove that the power of ordination is inherent in mini&s;ters, and that Chri&s;t never gave that power to the church as a body. This he dedicated to their Governor; and he therein allowed that the people have a right to choo&s;e their mini&s;ters, but not to ordain them, any more than the freemen of Connecticut have to &s;wear their magi&s;trates into office. An an&s;wer was wrote to him, and he made a reply in 1766. But then both his patron and his compari&s;on failed him, be|cau&s;e his Governor and &s;everal magi&s;trates were left out of office by the people, for favouring the stamp-act. And what could he then do? He &s;lipt over the line, and &s;aid, "The Governor of a Province is, by the King's commi&s;&s;ion, in|ve&s;ted with power and authority as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch an officer, di&s;tinct from the rights, powers and privileges, belonging to the government, by the con&s;titution, charter, and laws of the land. And though the magi&s;tracy, and other officers, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, have a legi&s;lative and executive authority with him, under his precedency, and act with him in judgment, in many ca&s;es; yet are the&s;e di&s;tinct branches of authority, originating from different fountains of power: The former from &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion from the King, the other from the con&s;titution and laws of the government. I take the ca&s;e to be <HI>much parallel</HI> in eccle&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="351" REF="018336_0366_0FA5CF4859A166C0">government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beckwith's &s;econd letter again&s;t lay-ordination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, p. 42, 43.</NOTE>." And we have &s;hewn (p. 275) that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts mini&s;ters claimed a higher power than the King allowed to his Governor; and he was the head of their e&s;tabli&s;hments for wor&s;hip, both there and in Connecticut. (Page 78, 178.) There|fore they are now in a deplorable ca&s;e; for an ocean three thou&s;and miles wide rolls betwixt the head and the body of that con&s;titution, &s;o that they have only a dead polluted <HI>carca&s;e</HI> left <HI>in their high places,</HI> Ezek. xliii. 7. And tho&s;e who have &s;o often re|jected the rea&s;onable te&s;timonies and petitions of the Bapti&s;ts, are forced now to become &s;uppliants to them, in order to &s;ave their polluted &s;cheme. In a Bo&s;ton paper, before mentioned, of February 5, 1781, they tell a &s;tory of a gentleman's babe, that was taken by an ape and carried to the roof of the hou&s;e, while he and his family were at church, and a carele&s;s maid got to &s;leep; and yet that the babe was &s;aved by their prayers. Upon which they name the Bapti&s;t agent, whom they accu&s;e of doing the like with their religion; but expre&s;&s;ed their hopes of having it now returned into its former con|dition. But herein they appear more contemptible than the prie&s;ts of Baal did in Elijah's time; for they came out like men, and performed their devotion in the &s;ight of the people, while the&s;e only publi&s;h|ed their prayers in news-papers, and were afraid that their names &s;hould be known. And the babe they pray for is not a human creature, but a mon|&s;ter, begotten upon a whore; and great <HI>happine&s;s</HI> is promi&s;ed to tho&s;e who &s;hall <HI>da&s;h &s;uch little ones again&s;t the &s;tones,</HI> P&s;alm cxxxvii. 8, 9. And the Bapti&s;ts not only covet &s;uch happine&s;s, but obedience to government requires it of them. For all Prote&s;|tant kingdoms have &s;et up their King as head of
<PB N="352" REF="018336_0367_0FA5CF4C251053B8">the church; but that name is now excluded from our Legi&s;lature. And to move the people to re|ceive this con&s;titution, the compilers of it &s;aid to them, "Your delegates did not conceive them|&s;elves ve&s;ted with power to &s;et up one denomina|tion of Chri&s;tians above another; for religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and individu|als<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Addre&s;s before the con&s;titution, March 2, 1780, p. 17.</NOTE>." And no man can take a &s;eat in our Legi|&s;lature until he &s;olemnly declares, "I believe the Chri&s;tian religion, and have a firm per&s;ua&s;ion of its truth<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;titution, chap, vi.</NOTE>." And as &s;urely as it is true, Chri&s;t is HEAD <HI>of all principality and power,</HI> and the church is COM|PLEAT in him; and required to do all her acts in <HI>his name.</HI> Therefore all wor&s;hip that is &s;upported in any other name is only <HI>will-wor&s;hip,</HI> Col. ii. 9, 10, 23, iii. 17. And though recour&s;e has often been had to Germany, for matter to prejudice people again&s;t equal liberty and believers bapti&s;m, yet twenty thou&s;and mercenaries have lately been brought from thence to fight again&s;t &s;uch princi|ples, and to deluge our land with blood again&s;t whom no denomination in America have acted with more prudence and vigour than the Bapti&s;ts. In the fall of 1778, our Legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed an act to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|bar inimical per&s;ons from returning into this State, wherein three hundred and eleven men were named as &s;uch; and our enemies are welcome to point out one Bapti&s;t among them if they can. Yet our op|ponents are &s;till &s;o unwilling to allow equal liberty, and that the power of church government &s;hould be in the body of each community, that a pamphlet was publi&s;hed at Bo&s;ton again&s;t it, near the clo&s;e of 1783, wherein it is &s;aid, "If the power of di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing its pa&s;tors is determined to be lodged in the

This author was an active member of the Convention who formed our new con&s;titution, but they are now en&s;nared in the work of their own hands; and to move others to relieve them he &s;ays, "The world produces not a &s;et of mini&s;ters more holy in their lives, more free from immorality of every kind, more pure in their doc|trines, or more ingenious, animated and pathetic in their addre&s;&s;es, than the clergy of New-England.&mdash; The ob&s;ervation hath often been made, that it is natural to the clergy to be fond of power. With|out di&s;pute they are &s;o, for they are men, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame feelings and inclinations with others. But in New-England, let them have felt ever &s;o much of this inclination, they have not di&s;covered it. Where is the man who can point out the in|&s;tance, where the mini&s;try have attempted to en|croach upon the rights of the churches<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 5.</NOTE>?" Such attempts have been &s;o openly di&s;covered, that at pre&s;ent I &s;hall only point the reader to his now doing of it, in the name clergy he &s;o often a&s;&s;umes. It is derived from the word that is tran&s;|lated <HI>heritage,</HI> in 1 Pet. v. 3, which name has long been u&s;urped by mini&s;ters, in order to avoid the &s;candal of <HI>lording</HI> it over the church.

<P N="7">VII. ALL Mayhew's arguments again&s;t the doc|trines of &s;overeign grace, pointed directly to univer|&s;al &s;alvation, though the minds of the people were not then prepared to receive it.

And in Augu&s;t, 1782, a pam|phlet was publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd edition, entitutled, <HI>Salvation for all men.</HI> Dr. Chauncy, undoubtedly, had a chief hand th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rein, and mo&s;t of the mini&s;ters in Bo&s;ton &s;eemed to fa|vour the &s;cheme, and others continue in fellow&s;hip with tho&s;e who have openly owned it. Their main arguments turn upon extending the divine good|ne&s;s to every individual, and Chri&s;t's merits al&s;o; although they do not attempt to tell how long it will be before all come to enjoy the &s;ame. They &s;ay, "There will be a great deal to be done, after the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Indeed (&s;ay they) the doctrine of PURGATORY, as now taught by the Pa|pi&s;ts, &s;eems to be a corruption of a genuine doc|trine held by the ancient fathers, concerning the <HI>fire of hell,</HI> which will <HI>burn up &s;in and lu&s;t</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said pamphlet, p. 14, 21.</NOTE>." But we do not hear of any yet who have ventured to a&s;&s;ert with Origen, that Chri&s;t will be crucified in the next world to &s;ave the devils. Several valuable pam|phlets have been wrote again&s;t the&s;e delu&s;ions, but tho&s;e mini&s;ters are &s;till held in fellow&s;hip.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. WHEN we have conceived an ill opinion of any denomination, it is exceeding dif|ficult to treat them fairly. An in&s;tance hereof is before me, that may be proper to mention. Ed|wards's treati&s;e on the will has pa&s;&s;ed through one edition at Bo&s;ton, and two or more in London, without ever being an&s;wered, although it is levelled directly again&s;t the turning point of Arminiani&s;m, to which the opinion of univer&s;al &s;alvation naturally &s;ucceeds. Many who do not own either of tho&s;e names, yet have conceived a &s;trong prejudice again&s;t Calvini&s;m, which Edwards profe&s;&s;ed to own, though
<PB N="356" REF="018336_0371_0FA5CF4F27325128">not every opinion that Calvin advanced. A late learned performance from London, re-printed at Philadelphia in 1783, contains the following things. The author, when giving his own deliberate ideas, &s;ays, "The vi&s;ible world demon&s;trates, it was made by an omnipotent power, and is pre&s;erved by the &s;ame power. What doth not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t, mu&s;t be originally created, and continually upheld by the power that made it.&mdash;There is no medium be|twixt &s;elf-exi&s;tence and dependence on its cau&s;e; therefore a ce&s;&s;ation from it of the power that made it is annihilation to it. Thus as all created things were made, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;olely by the energy of the Creator's <HI>will</HI> and power, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, whil&s;t they exi&s;t, be omnipre&s;ent with them, in them, and through them; therefore cannot be igno|rant of any thing relating to them, nor unconcern|ed about them, or any part of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phipps again&s;t. Newton, p. 37, 38.</NOTE>." If &s;o, then the creature can do no act but what his Cre|ator &s;ees cau&s;e either to order or permit, which is the e&s;&s;ence of Calvini&s;m. No, &s;ays this au|thor, "We attribute the whole of man's &s;alvation to the light or grace within, fir&s;t and la&s;t, without at all placing man's de&s;truction to the account of his Maker, which John Calvin directly doth." And after attempts to prove this charge from ancient writings, he tries to confirm it from Edwards on the will. And in reference to his main point, he &s;ays, "We are told, <HI>the will is always determined by the &s;tronge&s;t motive.</HI> Has the will no liberty then at any time? Is it always &s;o <HI>forcibly</HI> determined, in all its motions, by circum&s;tances and motives &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively ari&s;ing upon it, from the original con&s;titu|tion of things, that every man is nece&s;&s;arily oblig|ed to think, &s;peak and act, ju&s;t as he doth?&mdash;Was
<PB N="357" REF="018336_0372_0FA5CF4FE0C23330">this really the ca&s;e, our <HI>inevitable</HI> acts would certain|ly render us no proper &s;ubjects of reward and puni&s;h|ment; of come, ye ble&s;&s;ed, or go, ye cur&s;ed. We mu&s;t be equally unintitled to approbation and cen|&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 86, 97, 98.</NOTE>." But I mu&s;t tell him and all his friends, that I am much better acquainted with Edwards's writings than they are, and I ab&s;olutely know that the ideas naturally ari&s;ing from the words <HI>forcibly</HI> and <HI>inevitable,</HI> as here u&s;ed, when charged upon Ed|wards, are entirely unju&s;t and abu&s;ive. And it tends to rai&s;e an evil temper in tho&s;e who read the &s;ame, again&s;t all the friends of Edwards's writings, of whom I am heartily one. I am certain that the author who has thus cen&s;ured him, is not a great|er friend to the full liberty of the human will, and again&s;t every idea of po&s;itive influence from God to re&s;train men from good, or to impel them to evil, than Edwards was. And I know that from my in|mo&s;t thoughts I abhor and dete&s;t every thing of that nature, and challenge all the &s;ons of men to prove the contrary if they can. Whether &s;aid au|thor will like the following de&s;cription of liberty is uncertain. In a Bo&s;ton paper of June 21, 1784, we are informed, that a new book of Dr. Chauncy's is now in the pre&s;s, which gives a view of man, "As an <HI>intelligent moral agent;</HI> having within him|&s;elf an <HI>ability</HI> and <HI>freedom</HI> to WILL, as well as to <HI>do,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to NECESSITY from any extraneous cau&s;e whatever."</P>
<P N="2">II. THIS perfectly agrees with that di&s;regard to God, and to equal liberty among the common peo|ple, which has lately been &s;o con&s;picuous in that metropolis. Perhaps a text could not be found more &s;uitable to have preached upon, at the com|mencement of our new con&s;titution, than the fol|lowing:
<PB N="358" REF="018336_0373_0FA5CF515CB37538">"Their children al&s;o &s;hall be as aforetime, and <HI>their congregation &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before me,</HI> and I will puni&s;h all that oppre&s;s them. <HI>And their nobles &s;hall be of them&s;elves, and their Governor &s;hall proceed from the mid&s;t of them,</HI> and I will cau&s;e him to draw near, and he &s;hall approach unto me; for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? &s;aith the Lord." Jer. xxx. 20, 21. But a noted mini&s;ter of Bo&s;ton took out the words here printed in <HI>Italic,</HI> and not the re&s;t, for the &s;ubject of his &s;ermon at that time; in which he told of con|&s;cience being pleaded on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion about religious liberty. And the two &s;ides are ex|actly the&s;e. The Bapti&s;ts pleaded that Chri&s;t's mi|ni&s;ters might be &s;upported only by his laws and influence: Their opponents pleaded &s;till to be called by his name, but that they could not in con&s;cience give up the u&s;e of &s;ecular force to &s;upport them. The Bapti&s;ts never a&s;ked for any greater liberty in this re&s;pect in the country than Bo&s;ton has long en|joyed: Their opponents plead con&s;cience for deny|ing it to them, which doubtle&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>gain is godline&s;s,</HI> and from &s;uch we are command|ed to withdraw. The mini&s;ter of Chel&s;ea, who in 1778 defied our Legi&s;lature to pre&s;erve order in the State, if they allowed equal liberty in the church, was received a member of that A&s;&s;embly in 1783, to tax others, while he pays none him&s;elf. But who can wonder at their treating the people thus, &s;ince their treatment of their Maker is &s;o flagrant! Claim his promi&s;es without regarding his precepts, which is the practice the <HI>tempter</HI> would have drawn our Saviour into, Mat. iv. 6, 7. But greater ab&s;ur|dity and bla&s;phemy can &s;carcely be conceived of, than to claim God's promi&s;es to &s;upport us in di&s;|obedience to his precepts, and to deny his right to
<PB N="359" REF="018336_0374_0FA5CF5183C64F00">govern our wills, further than we plea&s;e. His au|thority and commands are certainly a cau&s;e <HI>without us;</HI> but we have already &s;een that the above writer thought them <HI>too &s;evere</HI> even for Adam in inno|cency, and that <HI>grace</HI> gives an exemption from that &s;everity. (Page 229, 230.) But I have &s;een a record concerning one, who was as zealous for <HI>con|fidence in the fle&s;h</HI> as the&s;e late di&s;putants are, and had as fair a claim to it as any of them, who at length was made to know that &s;aid law was <HI>haly, ju&s;t, and good;</HI> that it was <HI>&s;criptural,</HI> but he a <HI>carnal &s;lave to &s;in,</HI> in&s;tead of having &s;uch high dignity and li|berty as he before imagined he had.' And NECES|SITY brought him mo&s;t <HI>freely</HI> to preach the faith that he before endeavoured to de&s;troy, 1 Cor. ix. 16. Gal. i. 16, 23. And any per&s;on in the world can as &s;oon cea&s;e to exi&s;t, as cea&s;e to de&s;ire happine&s;s, and to e&s;cape mi&s;ery. A fal&s;e imagina|tion of <HI>good</HI> in the forbidden fruit, drew our fir&s;t parents into rebellion again&s;t God; and &s;uch ima|ginations are the only &s;ource of &s;in in all their chil|dren, James i. 14, 15. <HI>Good</HI> is &s;till their pur|&s;uit, but the have lo&s;t the knowledge of who can give it, or what it is; but the regenerate &s;oul knows both, and this is the preci&s;e difference be|tween them, P&s;alm iv. 6, 7. Who does not know that debtors and criminals are not fit judges in their own cau&s;es? yet that is the ca&s;e with all rea&s;oners again&s;t the truth and perfection of God's written word. How would wrong judgment proceed in civil Courts, if the Judges or jurors were allowed to con&s;true laws according to a rule <HI>within them,</HI> in&s;tead of a fixed known &s;tandard! If we believe the word of truth, a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate tyrant, a mo&s;t hardened wretch, yet <HI>gladly</HI> &s;ent I&s;rael away with rich trea&s;ures, the &s;ame night which God had told
<PB N="360" REF="018336_0375_0FA5CF521B6A91E8">Abraham of four hundred and thirty years before. Exod. xii. 33, 40, P&s;alm cv. 37, 38. Which turn of his will and choice was by a cau&s;e <HI>without him,</HI> which brought him to act voluntarily and exactly according to a previous immutable decree, and that without giving any renewing grace to his &s;oul. But as &s;oon as death was out of view, he eagerly pur&s;ued I&s;rael into the Red Sea, where he and his army peri&s;hed. And none but infidels will pretend to deny the ju&s;tice of God in that de&s;truction, although it was he that exactly di&s;|po&s;ed all the circum&s;tances which moved Pharoah voluntarily to act as he did. And the go&s;pel re|fers to this in&s;tance, to &s;hew how, by <HI>much long-&s;uffering, ve&s;&s;els of wrath are fitted to de&s;truction,</HI> ac|cording to the &s;overeign <HI>will of God.</HI> Rom. ix. 17, 18, 22. And tho&s;e who will not believe him here, will in vain cry for mercy hereafter. Tho&s;e who are effectually <HI>drawn</HI> to Chri&s;t by <HI>divine teach|ing,</HI> know that they <HI>could not</HI> have come without it, nor avoid coming mo&s;t freely with it. John vi. 44, 45. And to hear many <HI>&s;peaking evil of things which they know not; but what they know naturally as brute bea&s;ts, and in tho&s;e things to corrupt them&s;elves:</HI> To &s;ee them <HI>tread down the good pa&s;tures, and foul the deep waters,</HI> and <HI>thru&s;t others with &s;ide and &s;houl|der,</HI> &s;erves to confirm believers in the truth of re|velation, and in the hope of a &s;peedy deliverance from &s;uch <HI>evil bea&s;ts,</HI> Jude x. Ezek. xxxiv. 18&mdash;25. As the wages of &s;in is death, God cannot be ju&s;t in paying the &s;ame to infants, but upon his right to con&s;titute Adam as their head to act for them, and dealing with them as &s;inners in him; for ju&s;|tice cannot pay wages where they are not due. And as Chri&s;t came into the world purely to &s;ave &s;inners, infants could have no part in his &s;alva|tion,
<PB N="361" REF="018336_0376_0FA5CF52DC76FCC0">if they were not &s;inners. That infants may par|take of that &s;alvation, even in their mothers womb, is certain, Luke i. 44. And it is as certain, that though the fir&s;t Adam was a figure of the &s;econd in &s;ome things, yet that he was not &s;o in others; and in none more plainly than the&s;e three, viz. the one brought death, the other life; the one by a judicial &s;entence of law, the other by a free gift of grace; the one by a &s;ingle offence ruined the world, the other atoned for <HI>many offences,</HI> and will finally bring forth a much more glorious world than that which Adam de&s;troyed. I conceive that the&s;e ideas, both of the re&s;emblance and the difference betwixt the two public heads of mankind, are plain|ly contained in the fifth of the Romans, and fif|teenth of the fir&s;t to the Corinthians. Yet how many are there who will have it, that Chri&s;t died equally for all the human race, and yet that he &s;aves but a part of them, becau&s;e their wills defeat his good de&s;ires and intentions? To the&s;e others have &s;ucceeded, who a&s;&s;ert that he died for every one of them, and will finally bring them all to happine&s;s, though not until many of them have been in hell-flames for thou&s;ands of years, to burn up their cor|ruptions. But I boldly declare I would as &s;oon wor|&s;hip the Pagan god of flies, as any imaginary &s;aviour that could po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken or di&s;appointed in any of his de&s;igns. I fully believe that God's plan of government was and is infinitely perfect. That it is calculated &s;o in infinite wi&s;dom, that all his di&s;pen|&s;ations &s;hall demon&s;trate to all intelligent creatures, that all de&s;irable good is to be enjoyed in obedi|ence to his revealed will, and nowhere el&s;e; but that di&s;obedience thereto is infinitely hateful and dreadful, how plea&s;ing &s;oever it may appear at fir&s;t. That he gives &s;inners opportunity to try their in|ventions
<PB N="362" REF="018336_0377_0FA5CF53ECF16EA0">to the utmo&s;t extent of them, mo&s;t plainly warning them of their danger in the mean time; and that examples of their defeat, and of ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hments, inflicted upon the impenitent, will be vi|&s;ible to the ble&s;&s;ed, and cau&s;e high prai&s;es to him <HI>forever and ever;</HI> which words are equally made u&s;e of to de&s;cribe the continuance of his glories, the happine&s;s of the &s;aints, and the mi&s;ery of the wicked, Rev. v. 13, xiv. 9&mdash;11, xix. 3, xx. 10, xxii. 5. And as it was the old &s;erpent that poi&s;on|ed our fir&s;t parents, by &s;etting up rea&s;on again&s;t re|velation, e&s;pecially in calling in que&s;tion the truth of the penalty of the law, &s;o the &s;ame poi&s;on is exceeding vi&s;ible and pernicious among their chil|dren at this day.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is mo&s;t certain that the reformation in the church of England, which took place in the days of Edward the &s;ixth, was produced by preach|ing the doctrines of original &s;in, ju&s;tification by faith in Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his &s;overeign and efficacious grace upon the &s;ouls of men, to their eternal &s;alvation. And it is as certain that a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">par|ture from the&s;e doctrines has been growing upon that church ever &s;ince. Taylor again&s;t original &s;in, though he was a di&s;&s;enter, yet was brought in|to the ea&s;t part of Connecticut by an itinerant mi&s;|&s;ionary of the church of England above forty years ago; and it has had an exten&s;ive circulation through this country. Many of other denominations were plea&s;ed with it, while they tried hard to per&s;uade the world that Whitefield was a di&s;hone&s;t man, and upon evil de&s;igns again&s;t this country, when he preached the go&s;pel according to the doctrines e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, both in Old-England and New. (Page 171.) Ten years after, a profe&s;&s;or of Har|vard college tried to fix that odium upon his cha|racter
<PB N="363" REF="018336_0378_0FA5CF54745B4648">in the minds of his pupils; and at the &s;ame time denied the liberty of go&s;pel mini&s;ters to preach in any pari&s;h where another was &s;ettled, without his licence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wiggle&s;worth's lectures concerning mini&s;ters power, 1754, p. 14&mdash;16;</NOTE> And if facts are fairly examined, will it not be found, that tho&s;e in our day, who have been mo&s;t fierce for taxing others where they are not repre&s;ented, yet are not willing to own that their Maker had a right to con&s;titute Adam as their re|pre&s;entative? In 1628 a charter was granted to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts from the Briti&s;h Court, which ex|empted this Colony from all taxes thereto, but only the fifth part of the gold and &s;ilver ore that &s;hould be found in it; and it gave the Colony the exclu|&s;ive right to choo&s;e their own Governors. But in 1684 the&s;e privileges were wre&s;ted from them, and their lands were all claimed by the crown, and great tyranny was here exerci&s;ed for &s;ome years, until the King was driven from his throne, and another was placed thereon by compact. He gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s a new charter of many privileges, but re&s;erved a power to tax our trade, and an arbitrary power in the crown to appoint our Governors, and to demand our property for their &s;upport. And as tho&s;e who <HI>turn every one to his own way can never have enough,</HI> the remainder of our charter privileges were taken away in 1774, and fleets and armies were &s;ent to compel this country into an unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>wills</HI> of the Briti&s;h Parliament. And after many terrible frowns of providence upon their unmerci|ful proceedings, a &s;peech from the Briti&s;h throne of November 2, 1780, &s;aid, "The pre&s;ent arduous &s;ituation of public affairs is well known; the whole force and faculties of the monarchies of France and Spain are drawn forth, and exerted to the utmo&s;t,
<PB N="364" REF="018336_0379_0FA5CF57B682F0D8">to &s;upport the rebellion of my Colonies in North-America, and, without the lea&s;t provocation or cau&s;e of complaint, to attack my dominions; and the undi&s;gui&s;ed object of this confederacy manife&s;tly is to gratify BOUNDLESS AMBITION, by de&s;troying the commerce, and giving a fatal blow to the POWER of Great-Britain. By the force which the late Palia|ment put into my hands, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of pro|vidence on the bravery of my fleets and armies, I have been enabled to with&s;tand the formidable at|tempts of my enemies, and to fru&s;trate the great expectations they had formed; and the &s;ignal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es which have attended the progre&s;s of my arms in the Provinces of Georgia and Carolina, gained with &s;o much honor to the conduct and courage of my officers, and to the valour and intrepidity of my troops, which have equalled their highe&s;t character in any age, will I tru&s;t have important con&s;equen|ces in bringing the war to a happy conclu&s;ion. It is my mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee this great end ac|compli&s;hed; but I am confident you will agree with me in opinion, that we can only &s;ecure &s;afe and honorable terms of peace by &s;uch powerful and re&s;pectable preparations, as &s;hall convince our enemies, that WE WILL NOT SUBMIT TO RECEIVE THE LAW FROM ANY POWER WHATSOEVER." Lord Cornwallis was one of his mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful officers in Carolina, who there gave orders, on Augu&s;t. 30, 1780, "That every militia man, who had borne arms with us, and afterwards joined the enemy, &s;hall be immediately hanged." Yet on December 30 General Clinton and Admiral Arbuthnot, as Com|mi&s;&s;ioners from the King for re&s;toring peace to the Colonies, gave out a declaration from New-York, "That Great-Britain had manife&s;ted the &s;incerity of her affectionate and conciliatory intentions, in re|moving

And befove they had got through they &s;aid, "The <HI>loyal</HI> are exhorted to per&s;evere in <HI>their</HI> integrity for the pre&s;ervation of their country, its religion and liberties." And <HI>this</HI> declaration arrived and was publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton ju&s;t before the King's &s;peech, which expre&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution not to receive law from any power what&s;oever, not even excepting the pow|er of heaven. And how much better were the wills of men in this land?</P>
<P N="4">IV. FOR &s;ix months after the war began the general welfare of the country was kept &s;o much in view, that men enough were ea&s;ily obtained to fill up our army, which was al&s;o plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. But a committee from the &s;outh|ward met at the camp in or near Cambridge, in October, 1775, to &s;ettle the affairs of the next cam|paign, who rai&s;ed the wages of officers, and lowered tho&s;e of the private &s;oldiers, which directly cau&s;ed an unea&s;ine&s;s; and a looking to private intere&s;t, both in and out of the army, gradually prevailed from that time, until in the fall of 1780 it procured a promi&s;e of half-pay to officers during life. And ju&s;t before the news of peace arrived, this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s aro&s;e &s;o high in the officers, as to appoint a public meeting in the camp at We&s;t-Point in the begin|ning of March, 1783 (without leave from General Wa&s;hington, who was there) to con&s;ult about either marching in arms to Philadelphia, and compelling
<PB N="366" REF="018336_0381_0FA5CF5A8312D998">the Congre&s;s to grant their de&s;ires, or el&s;e drawing off into the wilderne&s;s, and leaving the country de|fencele&s;s to the ravages of the enemy. And though, with a wi&s;e and ma&s;terly addre&s;s, General Wa&s;hing|ton prevented their taking either of tho&s;e horrid &s;teps, yet none can tell how much influence the&s;e contrivances had, to produce a vote in Congre&s;s for five years whole-pay, in lieu of the half-pay dur|ing life. And though the war was leveiled again&s;t hereditary claims of power over others, and to &s;e|cure equity among all the inhabitants, and the ar|ticles of union and confederation between the&s;e States expre&s;ly forbid their granting any titles of nobility, yet in May following tho&s;e officers pre|&s;umed to incorporate a &s;ociety among them&s;elves, to have an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and each a gold|en medal and blue ribbon, with a large fund of money at command, and power to elect our chief rulers into their &s;ociety. This di&s;covered their di&s;po&s;itions, whatever alterations may have been made in their &s;ociety &s;ince.</P>
<P N="5">V. THE above proceedings have cau&s;ed un&s;peak|able difficulties through the&s;e States, which have been loudly complained of by multitudes, who &s;till are bewitched with the opinion, that they are born in a like covenant as the &s;eed of Abraham were, which gave them a right to make &s;ervants of others who were not in that covenant. Yea, and al&s;o with the opinion that civil Legi&s;latures have a right to empower &s;ome men to covenant for others with religious teachers, and to compel them to fulfil it. And this practice (which is directly again&s;t the law of God even as it was given to the Jews) was at the commencement of our new con&s;titution called GOD|LINESS, in capitals, while <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> was put in &s;mall letters. Which things are not mentioned becau&s;e
<PB N="367" REF="018336_0382_0FA5CF5B1EB22B68">I think my&s;elf better by nature than others, for I know the contrary. And after renewing grace was granted, I was &s;uch a dull &s;cholar in Chri&s;t's &s;chool, that I was thirty-two years in learning a le&s;&s;on of only &s;ix words, viz. <HI>one Lord, one faith, and one bapti&s;m.</HI> It took ten years to get clear of the cu&s;tom of putting bapti&s;m before faith, and near five more to learn not to contradict the &s;ame in prac|tice; after which above &s;eventeen trying years roll|ed over us, before we could refrain from an impli|cit acknowledgment of more than one Lord in re|ligious affairs. And what noi&s;e has been made in the world &s;ince, only becau&s;e we will not give up this le&s;&s;on, and obey man rather than God! And the chief movers therein, undoubtedly, are men who deny his right to impute Adam's &s;in to them, or to damn them for not receiving Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s for their ju&s;tification. Neither can any own the&s;e doctrines, and be &s;elf-con&s;i&s;tent, in holding that natural birth or human doings can bring infants into the covenant of grace. If it be of grace, then it cannot be of the birth or works of nature. <HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. Circumci&s;ion was a type of his death, and of our being cut off from confidence in the fle&s;h, and ingrafted into him by regeneration. Before his per&s;onal coming this &s;ign was, by divine in&s;titution, put upon many who had not the thing &s;ignified within them; but as Abraham had it, it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to him, while it was only a &s;ign or type to many others, Rom. iv. 11, Col. ii. 11, 12. By the covenant with Abraham, none were to be circumci&s;ed but &s;uch as were born in his hou&s;e, or bought with his money; in which capacity he was an eminent type of Chri&s;t, who&s;e church is con&s;ti|tuted of per&s;ons purcha&s;ed with his blood, and re|generated
<PB N="368" REF="018336_0383_0FA5CF5BE1D66E08">by his &s;pirit. Aaron was al&s;o a noted type of him, and his lawful &s;eed a type of regene|rate &s;ouls, who are the <HI>&s;piritual hou&s;e</HI> which is built upon the foundation that is <HI>di&s;allowed of men.</HI> And in vain do any of them try to prove the covenant to be the &s;ame now that it was with Abraham, un|til they can prove that Chri&s;t is hereafter to come, and endure another crucifixion. <HI>My&s;tery Babylon,</HI> which means the my&s;tery of confu&s;ion, was erected by <HI>confounding</HI> type and anti-tpye, church and &s;tate, together. For a woman after marriage to refu&s;e to be governed by her hu&s;band, and to &s;ay, <HI>I will go after my lovers, that gave me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink,</HI> proves her to be a <HI>harlot.</HI> And by this practice the church of Rome became the <HI>mother of harlots, and abomina|tion of the earth. Kings have committed fornica|tion with her; and by her &s;orceries were all nations deceived.</HI> How much have Prote&s;tants been de|ceived with the&s;e abominations! To &s;et up any mere man as head of the church, is an imitation of tho&s;e who crucified our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, by holding to an <HI>earthly kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> The taking away of the property of the people <HI>by force,</HI> for the prie&s;ts in the church of I&s;rael, brought amazing vengeance upon tho&s;e who gave countenance to that practice; yet the like iniquity has been tena|ciou&s;ly held fa&s;t, by men who call them&s;elves mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel; and <HI>forcing</HI> away the property of the Bapti&s;t for &s;uch, has been done in various part of this country, even down into this year 1784. and much clamour is made again&s;t them, only for refu&s;ing to give any countenance to &s;uch wicked|ne&s;s. But the call from heaven to all the &s;aints is, <HI>come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her

<P N="6">VI. LATE rea&s;onings have &s;et the creature man &s;o high, as to deny that a cau&s;e without him can determine his choice; while they hold that God's choice mu&s;t be determined by what he &s;ees in the creature, and not in him&s;elf. But the only &s;eed that can produce the new birth gives &s;uch a turn to the mind, as to view all fle&s;h but as fading gra&s;s, and the inhabitants of the world but as gra&s;shoppers be|fore God. Yea, as a drop of the bucket, and &s;mall du&s;t of the balance. And to &s;et the contra&s;t in its full light, it is declared that <HI>all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him le&s;s than nothing and vanity.</HI> This is the <HI>incorruptible &s;eed,</HI> of which &s;ouls are <HI>born again,</HI> I&s;ai. xl. 6&mdash;17, 1 Pet. i. 23, 24. In our natural darkne&s;s we imagine that our obligation to &s;erve God and to come to Chri&s;t depends upon our will and plea&s;ure; and that when we get ready to &s;et about the work in earne&s;t, his goodne&s;s and mercy will nece&s;&s;arily bring him to ap|pear for our help, and to pardon and &s;ave us. Where|as in truth it is as much impo&s;&s;ible for any ration|al per&s;on ever to be exempt, for one moment, from obligation to love God with all his powers, and to love his neighbours as him&s;elf, as it is for him to e&s;cape out of God's pre&s;ence, or to put an end to his own exi&s;tence. When Chri&s;t came and laid down his life for us, he gave the fulle&s;t demon&s;tration of the truth and love of God (as it was previou&s;ly re|vealed in predictions and figures) and greatly en|hanced our obligation to love and obey him; and al&s;o clearly opened the way for our doing it, in new|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, and not in the oldne&s;s of the letter. The oldne&s;s of the letter lays every &s;in and defect as a bar in the way of approach to a holy God; but

Though Adam in innocency could have no idea of a mediator, or of pardon and clean&s;ing from &s;in; yet his obliga|tion to the God of truth made it his indi&s;pen&s;able duty to believe and obey him, in all his revealed will, and highly criminal to call the &s;ame in que&s;|tion. And unbelief &s;till remains un&s;peakably cri|minal in his po&s;terity; for their natural powers of thinking and choice are not lo&s;t. Therefore the more unable we are to love God with all our pow|ers, and to believe and obey his revealed will, the more guilty and inexcu&s;able; becau&s;e we love the creature in&s;tead of the Creator, and regard lying vanities in oppo&s;ition to eternal truth, which is con|firmed by every event that ever happened. Good men and bad, angels and devils, all act according to the characters given of them in the holy &s;crip|tures. No &s;oil can bear good wheat until the roots naturally in it are broken up, and the wheat &s;own therein; &s;o the new birth cannot be wrought in any but by divine revelation. It is not a creation of new faculties, but the giving new ideas and di&s;po|&s;itions, which were our indi&s;pen&s;able duty before, but our evil hearts were contrary thereto. Break|ing up of the thorns and briers in a field, is remov|ing things which ought not to be there; and the good &s;eed being &s;own, and an union formed between the &s;eed and the &s;oil, the birth, the growth is pro|duced. By &s;uch means as the&s;e great relief was granted to our country, when its ruin &s;eemed inevi|table. For at the clo&s;e of 1779 public credit was &s;unk &s;o low, that forty paper dollars would not buy more of the produce of our own country, than one
<PB N="371" REF="018336_0386_0FA5CF5EDC9C3FD0">would in 1775; and from thence to the end of the war very few &s;oldiers were rai&s;ed in New-England, but upon private per&s;onal &s;ecurities; and large quantities both of cloathing and provi&s;ions, that were rai&s;ed for them, never reached to their camps, by rea&s;on of the unfaithfulne&s;s and treachery in tho&s;e who &s;hould have conveyed the &s;ame to them. But in the year 1779 a fre&s;h revival of religion was grant|ed, which increa&s;ed in the year 1780, and &s;pread the mo&s;t exten&s;ively and powerfully through New-Eng|land, that any revival had done for near forty years. Be&s;ides con&s;iderable additions that were made to &s;ome of the Congregational churches, it greatly in|crea&s;ed the Bapti&s;t churches that were formed be|fore, and rai&s;ed about twenty new ones. Accord|ing to the be&s;t accounts yet obtained, there were not le&s;s than two thou&s;and per&s;ons baptized upon a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith in New-England, only in the year 1780; and chiefly in the States of New Hamp&s;hire and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. And though true religion is directly, oppo&s;ite to wars and fight|ings among men, yet it teacheth an inviolable re|gard to truth and equity; and no &s;mall part of the duty of love is a defence of the innocent, when their rights are invaded, and their lives are in danger. The go&s;pel &s;hews that the only lawful u&s;e of the &s;word, is to puni&s;h &s;uch as <HI>work ill to their neighbour;</HI> and &s;ubjection to the powers that do it is a matter of <HI>con&s;cience</HI> with believers, Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;10. And this revival of religion was undoubtedly a great means of &s;aving this land from foreign inva&s;ion, and from ruin by internal corruption; though the lat|ter is &s;till &s;o great, that there has been but little re|joicing, and le&s;s thankfulne&s;s, for the deliverance and peace which are wonderfully granted to us. The Warren A&s;&s;ociation, at their meeting, September 9,
<PB N="372" REF="018336_0387_0FA5CF604F7E3790">1783, gave their views of the&s;e times in the fol|lowing addre&s;s to their countrymen, viz.</P>

<P>"AFTER a long and very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, we re|joice at this opportunity of congratulating you, up|on the return of peace to the nations, and to our land in particular, with a pro&s;pect of un&s;peakable advantages to the pre&s;ent and future generations. Indeed we are not in&s;en&s;ible that many are &s;orrow|ful and complaining, in&s;tead of rejoicing at the&s;e times; &s;everal cau&s;es whereof are obvious. For ever &s;ince our fir&s;t parents revolted from heaven, in order to plea&s;e their eyes and their ta&s;te, their children have been chiefly influenced by carnal &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of rea&s;on and truth. And the bur|then of taxes, the great &s;carcity of ca&s;h, with the pre&s;&s;ing calls for money from every quarter, have drawn a terrible gloom over many minds; which is greatly increa&s;ed by a view of the untried &s;cene of political exi&s;tence into which we have entered, where none can tell what is before us; and we have no &s;uch arm of fle&s;h to tru&s;t to as formerly. Ad|ded to which are a great variety of di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es, with the u&s;e of corrupt &s;chemes to re|pair them, and to get more power and gain, among all orders of men in the land, which make a num|ber think our ca&s;e almo&s;t de&s;perate. But the go&s;pel gives light, and opens the mo&s;t glorious pro&s;|pects, where nature can &s;ee nothing but darkne&s;s. It a&s;&s;ures us that &s;ufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, and forbids anxiety about to-morrow, be|cau&s;e a &s;parrow cannot fall to the ground, nor an hair from your heads, without the providence of our heavenly Father. And what confirmations of this truth have we had? Yea, and which now &s;urround us? A main hope of our enemies was built upon the
<PB N="373" REF="018336_0388_0FA5CF6071661670">pro&s;pect of &s;tarving us into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but behold! the &s;howers and &s;hines of heaven were not at their command; no, nor the hearts of the people neither. The events of this war are unparalleled.&mdash;Deceitful rea&s;onings from the power given to the members and rulers of the Jewi&s;h church, have per&s;uaded people for many ages, that &s;ome men are born with a right to govern others, and that they are not ac|countable to the people for what they receive and do; which has been the grand &s;ource of oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny through the world. But how has God rent away this veil of darkne&s;s! The American re|volution is wholly built upon the doctrine, that all men are born with an equal right to what provi|dence gives them, and that all righteous govern|ment is founded in compact or covenant, which is equally binding upon the officers and members of each community.&mdash;And as &s;urely as Chri&s;tianity is true, Chri&s;t is the only lawgiver and head of his church; whom he will &s;ave from the power both of <HI>gallies</HI> and <HI>gallant &s;hips,,</HI> tho&s;e modern engines of tyranny, I&s;ai. xxxiii. 16&mdash;24. And his laws deter|mine that his mini&s;ters &s;hall neither be tyrants nor &s;laves: Shall neither be &s;upported by <HI>forcing</HI> away any man's property without his per&s;onal con&s;ent, nor <HI>go a warfare of their own charges,</HI> Mat. x. 7&mdash;10, Luke x. 3&mdash;12, 1 Cor. ix. 7&mdash;14. Oppo&s;ite ex|tremes about the&s;e matters have long &s;erved to up|hold each other. The terms <HI>hire</HI> and <HI>reward,</HI> on one hand, have been taken to drag this affair into &s;ecular courts; and the word <HI>freely,</HI> on the other, to excu&s;e people from doing any thing to &s;upport their mini&s;ters; as if <HI>freedom</HI> belonged only to mi|ni&s;ters, while the people were <HI>&s;laves</HI> to their lu&s;ts. Whereas it is as clear as the day-light, that the ob|ligations between pa&s;tors and people are mutual;
<PB N="374" REF="018336_0389_0FA5CF611A30F8A8">and that their union and welfare greatly depend up|on a free and faithful di&s;charge thereof, out of &s;u|preme love to God; viewing them&s;elves to be but &s;tewards of all their gifts and trea&s;ures, who mu&s;t &s;oon give account unto him of their &s;teward&s;hip: Yea, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat he only can give them &s;ucce&s;s or en|joyment in any undertaking whatever.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THE next thing before us, is to give a di&s;tinct though brief a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ount of the late revival of religion, and of the &s;tate of the Bap|ti&s;t churches. And we may begin with the affairs of Martha's Vineyard, an i&s;land about twenty miles long, and ten broad, whereon are the towns of Edgarton, Ti&s;bury, and Chilmark. They are a county by them&s;elves, for holding of Inferior Courts, from whence they may appeal to Superior Courts in other counties. From Falmouth, in Barn&s;table county, to the entrance of the harbour of Holmes's Hole, on &s;aid i&s;land, is nine miles; which harbour is much frequented by tho&s;e who &s;ail upon the&s;e coa&s;ts, and piloting of ve&s;&s;els round
<PB N="376" REF="018336_0391_0FA5CF66553E2028">Cape-Cod and el&s;ewhere is no &s;mall part of the bu|&s;ine&s;s of its inhabitants. The line betwixt Edgar|ton and Ti&s;bury comes down upon the head of &s;aid harbour, &s;o that the inhabitants round it are upon the corners of two towns, &s;even or eight miles from the meeting-hou&s;es in either of them: which I am told &s;ome of their children of fifteen or &s;ixteen years old never &s;aw. For the &s;oil is generally thin and barren, &s;o that but very few hor&s;es can be kept there, and the men are much employed on the &s;ea, or in getting &s;u&s;tenance out of it: Yet they have been all taxed to a wor&s;hip that they or their fami|lies could but rarely attend, and from which they &s;eemed to get no good; &s;o that at length very few of them went to any public wor&s;hip at all. It is &s;aid, however, that but few intemperate per&s;ons were found among them. The war added greatly to their calamities, as our State could not protect them, and they lay at the mercy of our enemies; who came there with a powerful force in the fall of the year 1778, and took from the i&s;land all their arms and ammunition, be&s;ides three hundred head of cattle and a thou&s;and &s;heep, and mo&s;t of the pro|duce of the land near &s;aid harbour. Dark indeed did their ca&s;e appear; and on December 26 was &s;uch a cold &s;now-&s;torm as cau&s;ed the death of &s;eventeen men in a privateer &s;loop at the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, and &s;eventy-five more in a brig near Plymouth. Yet this terrible &s;torm drove into a creek, at the head of Holmes's Hole, &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of ba&s;s as &s;upplied the inhabitants of the whole i&s;land with as many of them as they were plea&s;ed to take, and more than they could make u&s;e of. And not long after a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;t away upon the we&s;t part of the aland, which gave the inhabitants a good &s;upply of rice. And greater
<PB N="377" REF="018336_0392_0FA5CF67CEAB4B78">favours of another kind were before them. By afflic|tive providences, and private means of grace, four per&s;ons near Holmes's Hole were awakened to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and danger, and in the &s;pring of 1780 they experienced a happy deliverance of &s;oul. And no &s;ooner was light granted to them than they en|deavoured to hold the &s;ame forth to others, which brought them to &s;et up religious meetings, and a number were hopefully converted by the&s;e means. And about the la&s;t of June they &s;ent for Elder Lewis, of Freetown, who went over in July, and preached and baptized a number of them. He did the like again in Augu&s;t and October, as Elder Hunt al&s;o did in November; and, by particular reque&s;t, I met them there in December, when a careful enquiry was made into their &s;entiments and views, and the order of the go&s;pel, with the &s;olemn nature of the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, was publicly laid open and in|culcated. After which, on December 21, 1780, we &s;aw fifty per&s;ons &s;olemnly &s;ign covenant together, to whom &s;ix more were added on the 24th, and all then &s;weetly communed together at the Lord's table. The high &s;heriff of the county was a leading mem|ber of this church, which contained &s;ome per&s;ons of every rank among them. The hu&s;band of one of them was born among the Portugue&s;e, and was now newly returned from a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing captivity in Eng|land. By &s;eeing and hearing of the&s;e wonders of divine grace, his vows in trouble were brought with authority upon his mind; and though the tempter &s;et in violently with his &s;ugge&s;tions, that there was no mercy for him, and that he had better go and drown him&s;elf, in the evening after this communion, yet &s;overeign grace prevented it, and &s;et his &s;oul at liberty, &s;o that he was &s;oon after baptized and joined to that church, as a con&s;iderable number
<PB N="378" REF="018336_0393_0FA5CF6846AD0F88">more al&s;o did. I have received no late accounts of the Indian Bapti&s;t church on that i&s;land. (Vol. 1, p. 439.)</P>
<P N="2">II. OUR next view is of the county of Barn|&s;table. The Separate mini&s;ter at Harwich, named in p. 175, has removed to Tamworth, in New-Hamp&s;hire, and the other of Barn&s;table is now a pa&s;tor of a Congregational church at Newmarket, in that State; and Bapti&s;t churches are rai&s;ed out of each of tho&s;e Separate &s;ocieties. A Bapti&s;t church was formed and organized at Harwich in 1757; but by advice of a Council, their mini&s;ter was depo&s;ed from his office in 1777, for immoral conduct, and they are now de&s;titute of a pa&s;tor, though they have an agreeable teacher with them. They have &s;ome members from Wellfleet, where our mini&s;ters have frequently preached to attentive audiences. A &s;mall pari&s;h in the &s;outh part of Harwich got a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, from the we&s;t part of our country, to preach in their pari&s;h meeting-hou&s;e; and in 1781 they formed a Bapti&s;t church there, and he was ordained their mini&s;ter: but he is upon the Arminian plan, and not in fellow&s;hip with our churches. The Bapti&s;t church in Barn &s;table was con&s;tituted June 20, 1771; but they were very &s;mall for &s;even years, and then a revival was granted, and another in 1781; and things at pre&s;ent appear encouraging among them, though they have not been able as yet to get a &s;ettled pa&s;|tor. There is the beginning of a Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Sandwich, in that county; but we may truly &s;ay of our times, the harve&s;t is great, and the la|bourers are few.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE ri&s;e of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t churh in Mid|dleborough has been de&s;cribed (p. 215); but coldne&s;s and &s;tupidity had greatly prevailed there|in
<PB N="379" REF="018336_0394_0FA5CF68A05D9948">for five years before the late revival of religion, which began in the latter part of 1778, and was at its height in July, 1780. The fir&s;t per&s;on ad|ded to the church in this revival was on Febru|ary 28, 1779, and eighty-five have been receiv|ed &s;ince, above two-thirds of whom belong to Bridgwater, in the we&s;t part of which town a large Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built la&s;t year, eight miles from ours, and they have now got a mini|&s;ter to preach to them, though as yet they remain a branch of our church. The ri&s;e of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough was as follows: Mr. Thomas Nel&s;on, who was born in the town June 6, 1676, ju&s;t before Philip's war broke out, removed into that part of it called A&s;awam&s;et, in 1717; about which time he joined to the fir&s;t Bap|ti&s;t church in Swanzey, as his wife al&s;o di Augu&s;t 5, 1723. In 1753 he and his &s;ons, with a few more, &s;et up a meeting at his hou&s;e, and obtained Mr. Ebenezer Hinds to preach to them. Four miles &s;outhwe&s;tward from thence Mr. James Mead was ordained pa&s;tor of a Separate church in 1751; but he died in 1756, after which the body of his church became Bapti&s;ts, and Mr. Hinds's hearers joined with them, and ordained him their pa&s;tor, January 26, 1756, in which office he &s;till continues. Mr. Nel&s;on died before this church was formed, in his eightieth year; but his wife, Mrs. Hope Nel&s;on, lived to be a member of it, and communed with them at the Lord's table after &s;he was an hundred years old. She died December 7, 1782, aged an hundred and five years and &s;even months. Her living po&s;terity, be&s;ides all that had decea&s;ed, were two hundred and fifty-&s;even in the year 1774. But as &s;ome of them are removed to Nova-Scotia, and to other di&s;tant places, their number when &s;he died
<PB N="380" REF="018336_0395_0FA5CF6982373AF0">has not &s;ince been obtained. Many of them are members of Bapti&s;t churches, and three of them are public teachers therein. Mr. Ebenezer Jones was ordained the pa&s;tor of the third Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough October 28, 1761; but whi&s;perers, who &s;eparate very friends, cau&s;ed &s;uch a divi&s;ion there two years after, as not only removed him from being their pa&s;tor, but al&s;o broke up their meeting for a time. He has been preaching for &s;ome years pa&s;t at Steventown, in the county of Al|bany. Mr. Hunt was ordained the pa&s;tor of &s;aid church October 30, 1771; in which year they had a con&s;iderable revival, and another much greater in 1780. Their letter to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, in September that year, gives the following account of it. Say they, "In our letters for &s;everal years pa&s;t, we had to lament the &s;ad decay of religion among us, and the abounding of iniquity, which in the la&s;t year increa&s;ed to the greate&s;t degree ever known in this place. Men were bold in wicked ways, and all the endeavours of a few faithful ones among us could not prevent it. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, things have taken another turn this year; for when &s;in, the great enemy of mankind, was <HI>coming in like a flood, the &s;pirit of the Lord has lifted up a &s;tandard again&s;t him.</HI> About the middle of March, on a Lord's day in the afternoon, there appeared a very vi&s;ible alteration in the face of the whole a&s;&s;em|bly; they were all attention to the word, and con|cern was di&s;covered in their countenances, which in|crea&s;ed &s;o that by the beginning of April &s;everal &s;cores of per&s;ons appeared under deep concern about their &s;ouls and eternal &s;alvation. And &s;ince the work began we have rea&s;on to hope that about one hun|dred &s;ouls have been turned from darkne&s;s to light, and eighty-three have been baptized.&mdash;It is very
<PB N="381" REF="018336_0396_0FA5CF6A2545CB38">remarkable in our view, to &s;ee &s;o many &s;uddenly turned from darkne&s;s to light, and have &s;uch a clear under&s;tanding of the nature of religion, and &s;o ready to practi&s;e what they know.&mdash;We have been remarkably free from di&s;orders, by means of which tho&s;e who appeared to oppo&s;e this work (who are chiefly of another denomination) and were waiting to &s;ee how things turned out, have &s;een &s;uch things as have greatly &s;tilled and convinced them. Thus has it plea&s;ed our gracious God to vi&s;it a mo&s;t unworthy people, and after a dark night of &s;orrow and mourning, to make us glad with his &s;alvation." From the beginning of the revival to September, 1781, more than an hundred per&s;ons were added to that church, above half of whom were males.</P>
<P N="9">IV. A BRANCH of this church is at Mar&s;hfield, where a &s;teady &s;ociety for wor&s;hip has been kept up for &s;ome years; and in the late revival a num|ber of per&s;ons were hopefully converted in Scitu|ate, on the north borders of our county; and fre|quent religious meetings were held there. This cau&s;ed a great unea&s;ine&s;s in the adjacent town of Hingham, where their mini&s;ters had long taught the world to tyrannize over the church (p. 159). And as an exhorter from Rhode-I&s;land govern|ment had attended &s;everal meetings in Scituate, the people of Hingham could not be content with|out &s;hewing their particular re&s;entment again&s;t him. Therefore one of them followed &s;aid exhort|er into Abington, as he was upon his return home, and importuned him to go and hold a meeting at his hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. This he at la&s;t con&s;ented to; and a numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of people met there for religious wor&s;hip in the evening of May 28, 1782. But ju&s;t as they were going to begin their exerci&s;e, a large mob
<PB N="382" REF="018336_0397_0FA5CF6B24A3C6A8">came up, who&s;e leader was a communicant in one of the churches in Hingham, and, by leave of the man who had invited &s;aid exhorter to his hou&s;e, they went in and &s;eized him, and carried him away with the bible in his hand; but upon his telling them that it was the be&s;t law he ever heard of, they knocked it out of his hand, and &s;tamped it under foot, with oaths and execrations too horrid to be repeated! And they brui&s;ed and injured his body, as well as tore his cloaths; and forcibly carried him and two other baptized brethren out of Hing|ham; and afterwards threatened the li&s;e of &s;aid ex|horter, if he ever came there again. By good ad|vice, a complaint was exhibited to the Grand Ju|ry of that county again&s;t the chief of tho&s;e rioters, and a bill was found again&s;t five of them, &s;up|ported by eight witne&s;&s;es; and four of the rioters were arraigned before the Court at Bo&s;ton, Octo|ber 10, and pleaded not guilty; upon which their trial was appointed to be on January 14, 1783; and they were laid under bonds then to appear; and the Court bound the witne&s;&s;es al&s;o to appear at that time, four of whom were men, and the others women. The &s;ea&s;on proved to be exceeding dif|ficult, by rea&s;on of &s;now, ice and a &s;evere air, yet the four male witne&s;&s;es appeared at the time ap|pointed, but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the rioters, neither was any forfeiture of their bonds exacted; but their trial was put off for two days, and all the witne&s;&s;es were required then to appear. A &s;leigh was therefore procured to carry two of the female witne&s;&s;es; but as they called at a friend's hou&s;e in Hingham in the evening, to refre&s;h them&s;elves, it was conveyed away and cut to pieces, and they could not find their hor&s;e till next day. Yet all the eight witne&s;&s;es appeared in Bo&s;ton at the time la&s;t appointed; but

But the world may now &s;ee what con|&s;ciences &s;uch men have. In the &s;pring tho&s;e rioters found that they could no longer put the ca&s;e off, and then they were in earne&s;t to &s;ettle it without a public hearing, which was finally done, by their engaging to pay all co&s;ts. But let the politicians of Bo&s;ton remember, that it is but a few years &s;ince they declared to the world, that a delay of ju&s;tice is a denial of ju&s;tice, and therefore that wherein they judged others they are &s;elf-condemned. And they appear more openly &s;o from the following in&s;tance. The burthen of civil taxes being exceed|ing heavy, and a pair of oxen being expo&s;ed to &s;ale therefor in Taunton, oppo&s;ition was made again&s;t the &s;ale; until a gentleman offered a ge|nerous price for them, and then the matter was &s;ettled. Yet to deter per&s;ons from any &s;uch thing for the future, two men of Taunton were &s;eized in the night, and carried off to Bo&s;ton by armed men, the Augu&s;t after &s;aid riot at Hingham. What right they had thus to bring men out of another county, belongs not to me to determine; but if an <HI>impartial</HI> regard to the public peace, as well as to the rights of Chri&s;tianity, had prevailed in the brea&s;ts of &s;ome men in Bo&s;ton, could tho&s;e rioters in their own county have po&s;&s;ibly been in|dulged as they were, and tho&s;e &s;ufferers have been &s;o cruelly treated!</P>
<P N="5">V. OFFICERS in the church as well as &s;tate often do much mi&s;chief if unfaithful, and much good if faithful in their &s;everal &s;tations. Our churches in Swanzey and Rehoboth have had large experience of
<PB N="384" REF="018336_0399_0FA7AF301D9B8F30">this. The ble&s;&s;ings which the fir&s;t church of Swan|zey enjoyed under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;trations of their elders, Miles, Luther and Wheaton, are touch+ed upon (vol. 1, p. 353, 506, vol. 2, p. 68, 121, 124). Mr. Samuel Maxwell was ordained a col|league with the la&s;t of them the year before his death. Mr. Maxwell lived to a great age, and was e&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">med a pious man; but he was &s;o un&s;teady in his principles and conduct, as to cau&s;e much un|happine&s;s in the churches. On this account he was, by his own reque&s;t, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Swanzey in 1739, and though he took the charge of the Bap|ti&s;t church in Rehoboth &s;ix years after, yet he did not continue four years with them. In 1742 &s;aid church in Swanzey &s;ettled a gifted mini&s;ter from Narragan&s;et, who had a thronged audience for a few years, yet then he was accu&s;ed of the &s;in of un|cleanne&s;s, which charge he never cleared up, but went off and left the church. Their next mini&s;ter was accu&s;ed of taking unju&s;t methods to get into that place; and he was much influenced by a few men in the church who were attached to Arminian|i&s;m; and by the&s;e means, the church that had two hundred members in pious Elder Wheaton's days, was reduced to a very &s;mall number, and the con|gregation al&s;o. After about thirty years he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed at his own reque&s;t, and removed away. And as the meeting-hou&s;e and mini&s;ter's hou&s;e in Warren were burnt by the enemy, and the place was &s;till ex|po&s;ed to their rage, they agreed at pre&s;ent to unite with Swanzey church, three miles off; and their pa&s;|tor was called and &s;ettled there. And &s;uch a divine ble&s;&s;ing was granted, that when I was there in Oc|tober, 1781, I was informed that within two years about two hundred per&s;ons had been added to the two churches in Swanzey. The former elders of
<PB N="385" REF="018336_0400_0FA7AF2970D84D90">the &s;econd church in Swanzey are before mention|ed (p. 11, 13, 43.) Their next elder, Job Ma&s;on, was ordained May 22, 1738, and was well e&s;teem|ed in his office until his decea&s;e, in Augu&s;t, 1775, aet. 80. His brother Ru&s;&s;el Ma&s;on, their pre|&s;ent pa&s;tor, was ordained November 2, 1752. Ge|neral redemption had been &s;o much held there, as to admit members upon a general declaration of their faith, until a powerful work among them, in the beginning of 1772, introduced particular rela|tions of the work of divine grace upon their &s;ouls; and light has greatly increa&s;ed among them &s;ince. And in this late revival it has introduced &s;inging in their public wor&s;hip. The town of Rehoboth calls for our next attention. The Bapti&s;t church form|ed there under Mr. Comer's mini&s;try (p. 121) in|crea&s;ed to ninety-five members in le&s;s than two years. But in 1736 a mini&s;ter was ordained in his &s;tead, who&s;e principles were un&s;ound; and &s;ix years after he took a whore in&s;tead of his wife, and went off with her. Since which diver&s;ity of &s;entiments about doctrines, terms of communion, &amp;c. have produced many &s;mall &s;ocieties in that town, which I &s;hall not attempt particularly to de&s;cribe here, as a li&s;t of them may hereafter be given. The two Bapti&s;t churches in Attleborough were formed out of Separate churches there. The pa&s;tor of the church in Norton (mentioned p. 232) after a pious and u&s;eful life, fell a&s;leep on Augu&s;t 23, 1768. After which the church united with a &s;mall &s;ociety in the north borders of Taunton, where they are become a large &s;ociety; and their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor was ordain|ed November 12, 1772. In the year 1780 there was a mo&s;t precious harve&s;t of &s;ouls among them. No other Bapti&s;t churches in that county have had
<PB N="386" REF="018336_0401_0FA7AF29D1CAFA38">more than one pa&s;tor; and their names may here|after be given.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THE three countie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t mentioned contain the whole of the ancient Colony of Plymouth (the fir&s;t in New-England) excepting the few towns &s;ince &s;et off to Rhode-I&s;land. The Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts is the next before us, the head county whereof is Suffolk. The affairs of the two Bapti&s;t churches in Bo&s;ton, their capital, have been de&s;cribed (vol. 1, p. 353, &amp;c. vol. 2, p. 33, 50, 125, 149, 269, 276.) To which I &s;hall add, that Mr. Condy was a gentleman of &s;uperior powers and learning, and of a very re&s;pectable character among mankind; but the &s;entiments he had imbibed about the doc|trines of &s;overeign grace, impeded his public u&s;e|fulne&s;s in the mini&s;try; and upon the in&s;talment of their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor, January 9, 1765, he freely re|&s;igned his office in that church. The pre&s;ent pa&s;|tor of their &s;econd church &s;ucceeded Mr. Davis in 1774. The next Bapti&s;t church in that county is in Bellingham, which was con&s;tituted October 15, 1750. Their fir&s;t pa&s;tor was Mr. Elnathan Wight, a pious and u&s;eful man, who died in November, 1761. To him &s;ucceeded their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor, who was in&s;talled there November 12, 1766. He was fir&s;t ordained at Stafford, June 5, 1755; but was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence by the advice of a Council, Augu&s;t 28, 1765, becau&s;e the majority of the church appeared to be &s;o much out of a go&s;pel line of tra|vel, that other churches withdrew their follow&s;hip from them. The re&s;t of the Bapti&s;t churches in that county have had no more than one mini&s;ter.

Mr. Eli&s;ha Rich was the fir&s;t pa&s;tor of our Chelmsford church, who was or|dained there October 5, 1774, but he removed in|to the State of Vermont near four years after. Their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor was ordained September 24, 1783. Bapti&s;t meetings are &s;teadily held at Framingham and We&s;ton, but churches are not formed there.</P>
<P N="7">VII. IN Worce&s;ter county, the church at Sutton, mentioned (p. 124.) was become finall when their aged pa&s;tor died, January 4, 1775, and they are &s;ince di&s;&s;olved. The &s;econd Bapti&s;t church there &s;ettled a mini&s;ter in 1768, who was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed four years after for not being found in the faith. Elder Green, of Leice&s;ter, after a very laborious and u&s;e|ful life, was taken to his re&s;t Augu&s;t 20, 1773, act. 73. Benjamin Fo&s;ter, A. M. educated at Yale col|lege, was ordained there October 23, 1776, and an evident ble&s;&s;ing attended his labours for a con|&s;iderable time. But differences about &s;ome points of practice ari&s;ing among them, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by mutual con&s;ent, about &s;ix years after, and re|moved and preaches to a new &s;ociety in Danvers, his native place. The fir&s;t pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Sturbridge died in 1755, and they have gone through many trying &s;cenes &s;ince, but have at pre&s;ent a pro&s;pect of &s;ettling an agreeable pa&s;tor &s;oon. Mr. Samuel Dennis was ordained at Peter&s;|ham in October, 1778, but he was taken from his beloved flock by death in April, 1783. The fir&s;t pa&s;tor of South-Brimfield church, in the county of Hamp&s;hire (p. 124) removed from thence to Nova+Scotia (though he came back afterward) and Mr. James Mellen was their &s;econd pa&s;tor, who is men|tioned p. 242, 243. Their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor was
<PB N="388" REF="018336_0403_0FA7AF319944AC78">ordained November 11, 1773, when the church was very &s;mall and feeble, but a great ble&s;&s;ing has been &s;ince granted there. They had but twenty-three members in the church before a revival began among them in 1779, which in their letter to our A&s;&s;ocia|tion, in September that year, was thus de&s;cribed, viz. "Dear brethren, we have to inform you, that by the grace of God we are at peace among our&s;elves, and enjoy much of that love which pa&s;&s;eth knowledge. The Lord of his mercy is come down among us, by his great and mighty power. Such &s;olemn meet|ings we never had before; it comes like the &s;howers of rain upon the mown gra&s;s. O the agonies of &s;oul that &s;ome feel, and the joys that &s;ome are, full and more than full of! It &s;eems as if heaven was come down here.

Brethren, pray for us. Some who a few weeks ago &s;eemed the mo&s;t &s;tupid, are now &s;peaking freely of their amazing joys, and behold|ing their bleeding and very precious Redeemer. The work is &s;o great that we cannot con&s;ent to our elder's meeting you in A&s;&s;ociation this year. We have this year thirty-four added by bapti&s;m; our whole number is fifty-&s;even." From our &s;i&s;ter church in Wilbraham, adjacent to them, they wrote at the &s;ame time and &s;aid, "We pray God to direct you in conferring upon matters that concern the vi&s;ible kingdom of Chri&s;t, and do that which may be for his glory, and the la&s;ting peace and benefit of his churches. Beloved, the love of Chri&s;t, that

Saints are quickened there|by, and &s;inners are converted to him. It is wonder|ful to behold the change that has been in the &s;pace of one year with us. The hearts of fathers are turn|ed to the children, and the children to the fathers.

<P N="8">VIII. AN elder from Berk&s;hire wrote Augu&s;t 29, 1779, and &s;aid, "I &s;natch a moment to ac|knowledge the debt of love.

Elder Ma&s;on has baptized perhaps near thirty more, and a number have de|clared what God has done for them, that are not yet baptized. O brethren, help us to prai&s;e the God of love!" From A&s;hfield they wrote in Sep|tember, 1780, and &s;aid, "The Lord has been plea&s;ed to pour out of his &s;pirit abundantly in this place, to the quickening of his children, and the conviction and conver&s;ion, of many &s;ouls, as we in a judgment of charity, have rea&s;on to believe.

Our pre&s;ent number is nine|ty-four." And in all the churches and mem|bers that were added to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1780, there was an increa&s;e of &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;ix members. Ninety were added only to the church in South-Brimfield, which formerly had pa&s;&s;ed through many and &s;ore trials. And from a mini&s;ter in the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, to whom I wrote, I received the following remark|able account, dated March 15, 1781. Says he,</P>

Some hundreds of &s;ouls are hopefully converted in the counties of Rock|ingham, Stafford and Grafton, in New-Hamp|&s;hire, within about a year pa&s;t. In the la&s;t jour|ney I went, before my beloved wife was taken from me, I baptized &s;eventy-two men, women, and &s;ome that may properly be called children, who confe&s;&s;ed with their mouths the &s;alvation God had wrought in their hearts, to good &s;atisfaction. Meredith, in Stafford, has a church gathered the year pa&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of between &s;ixty and &s;eventy members. I baptized forty-three in that town in one day, and &s;uch a &s;olemn weeping of the mul|titude on the &s;hore I never before &s;aw.

A large part of tho&s;e planta|tions, for an hundred and fifty miles upon our ea&s;tern &s;hores, have no Congregational mini&s;ters. Near thirty incorporated towns in the county of Lincoln have &s;carce five &s;uch mini&s;ters &s;ettled in them. But I have received the following entertaining account of the revival of religion in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P N="10">X. A MAN who was born there, and was about ten years old when &s;uch a noi&s;e was made again&s;t Mr. Whitefield, as we have de&s;cribed (p. 171) &s;ays,
<PB N="392" REF="018336_0407_0FA7AF343AD8A6C8">"I was then convinced that neither my&s;elf, nor tho&s;e men who &s;pake with &s;o much &s;pite and malice, were the children of God; and I was rationally con|vinced that tho&s;e they &s;pake again&s;t were his chil|dren, although they called them deluded, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed with the devil, Highflyers and Newlights; and though they &s;pake it as a &s;candal, yet I believed I mu&s;t know that light, or peri&s;h in darkne&s;s; and I &s;till retained a &s;elfi&s;h or legal love to tho&s;e people, though never &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed. And from that time until I was twenty-&s;ix years old, the &s;pirit of God was &s;triving with me, by awakening my con&s;cience, con|vincing me of &s;in, and that I mu&s;t be born again. And &s;o I went on &s;inning and repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g reforming and forgetting, looking upon God to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch a God as I would have him to be; in hopes, that for what good there was in me, he would &s;hew mercy to me. But when about twenty-&s;ix years of age, and my affections much &s;et upon the things of the world, ju&s;t about the time I was married, I was &s;uddenly taken down with &s;ickne&s;s, and part of the time de|prived of rea&s;on; and tho&s;e who &s;aw me de&s;paired of my recovery. But, glory be to God, he dealt not with me according to my de&s;erts, but accord|ing to his rich love and free grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for he enlightened my under&s;tanding, and awak|ened my con&s;cience, and &s;et my &s;ins in order be|fore me, and that which I had forgotten came all to memory, with the breach of many vows and promi&s;es, which grieved me to the heart as I thought. O, I cried to God to forgive my &s;ins, and to &s;hew mercy for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; for I &s;aw my&s;elf a condemned &s;inner, and told tho&s;e who came to di&s;cour&s;e with me about religious matters, that I &s;aw my&s;elf to be the greate&s;t &s;inner of all men; and had I owned all this globe, I would have given it
<PB N="393" REF="018336_0408_0FA7AF34F0C1D790">all for an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. Yea, all the men upon earth could not have per&s;uaded me out of the opinion, that I was more willing to receive Chri&s;t than he was to receive me. But it plea&s;ed the Lord, in about a month, to rai&s;e me up to a con&s;iderable &s;tate of bodily health, with a great earne&s;tne&s;s, as I thought, to &s;eek and &s;erve him; reading the &s;criptures often, praying in &s;ecret and in my family, exhorting many others to &s;eek and &s;erve God, and warning them again&s;t evil practices. Yet in all this I did not think I was born again, neither did I think I could do any thing of my&s;elf to forward the work of regeneration; and here I got clear of one fal&s;e hope, and began to build up|on another; now I put great dependence in my non|dependence, and &s;o went on with my reformation, thinking all the good I did that it was God who wrought it in me, and the evil came from the devil and my own corrupt nature; and this hope gave me great joy in my good performances, but great grief, guilt and repentance, for the commi&s;&s;ion of any known &s;in, or the omi&s;&s;ion of any known duty; and &s;o I went on for ten or twelve years, and after that I grew more engaged after the trea&s;ures of the world, and then my delight in religion died away. &mdash;At length I began to think I was blind, and ig|norant both of my own mi&s;erable e&s;tate, and of the remedy God had provided. I prayed that God would enlighten my under&s;tanding; but &s;till I grew more blind, ignorant and wicked, as I thought, but kept it to my&s;elf, till at la&s;t I got hedged up &s;o that I could neither read nor pray, which la&s;ted but a &s;hort time. This was a &s;abbath morning, Septem|ber 30, 1781.&mdash;Now I began to &s;ee the ba&s;e views I formerly had of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the plan of &s;alvation; for when I had a di&s;covery of ac|tual
<PB N="394" REF="018336_0409_0FA7AF35B2B7B038">&s;ins, and the danger I was expo&s;ed to thereby, I would repent and reform, and think what a glo|rious Saviour Chri&s;t was, and that &s;ome time or other he would &s;ave me from hell, and take me to glory, with a de&s;ire to be happy, but no de&s;ire to be holy. But, glory be to God, he now gave me another view of &s;alvation; now I &s;aw his law to be holy, and loved it, though I and all my conduct was con|demned by it. Now I &s;aw that God's ju&s;tice did not &s;trike again&s;t me as his creature, but as a &s;inner, and that Chri&s;t died not only to &s;ave from puni&s;hment, but from &s;in it&s;elf. I &s;aw that Chri&s;t's office was not only to make men happy, but to make them holy, and the plan now looked beautiful to me; I had no de&s;ire to have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t tittle of it al|tered, but all my cry was to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conformed to it.&mdash; On October 3 the load of guilt and condemnation was in&s;tantly removed, and my &s;oul was filled with joy and peace. Then it was a&s;ked me, could I de|&s;ire any thing more? And at fir&s;t I &s;aw no want, till I found a want of love and gratitude in me to return thanks to God for this great deliverance, which I began to cry and plead for; and tho&s;e words were &s;poke to me, <HI>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend;</HI> which came with &s;uch light, life, love and power, that I knew it to be the voice of my ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, who by his holy &s;pirit &s;et that glorious &s;eal to my &s;oul that God is true; and now, by his grace, I could &s;peak forth redeeming love and free grace without dread or fear.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. WHEN we turn our eyes we&s;tward, and take a view of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in America, the folly of man and the goodne&s;s of God appear very con&s;picuous therein. The learned Mr. Callender, in his century &s;ermon, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;cruple whether Mr. Roger Williams, the founder of that town and Colony, was ever a member of that church, or not. But he was convinced of this mi&s;|take afterwards. Governor Winthrop, the mo&s;t in|genuous
<PB N="396" REF="018336_0411_0FA7AF3AF60957F0">and upright writer of any gentleman at Bo&s;ton in that day, who&s;e writings have come down to us, dates the beginning of the Bapti&s;t church in Providence in March, 1639, and &s;ays it began by Ezekiel Holiman's baptizing Mr. Williams, and then he baptizing the re&s;t. But that in July after, the opinion mentioned (p. 95) put a &s;top to his further travel with them. And Richard Scott, who was one of them, &s;ays two or three of the church withdrew with Williams. (Vol 1, p. 106&mdash;108.) Thomas Olney was their next mini&s;ter. But the diver&s;ity of &s;entiments mentioned in this volume (p. 94&mdash;96) brought &s;uch darkne&s;s over their af|fairs, that no regular records before 1770 are now found therein. Their ancient fathers, Olney, Dex|ter, Wickenden, Tillingha&s;t and others, could write well, as their civil records and &s;ome private papers witne&s;s; and I cannot but hope that more di&s;tinct accounts of their religious affairs will hereafter be di&s;covered. Elder Tillingha&s;t, who&s;e memory is precious (p. 110, 114) pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nly told his people their duty to future mini&s;ters; but him&s;elf was &s;o far from being chargeable to them, that he gave the lot up|on which their fir&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built, and died in a good old age, in 1718, and his po&s;terity are now numerous and re&s;pectable. Mr. Ebenezer Jencks, brother to the Governor, was a pa&s;tor of that church from 1719, to his decea&s;e in 1726, colleague with Elder James Brown (p. 116.) And their two families have, in late years, done the mo&s;t of any families upon earth for the promotion of learning, and the Bapti&s;t cau&s;e in Providence. El|der Win&s;or, there mentioned, continued in that of|fice until his death in 1758, aet. 81. Elder Thomas Burlingham was a colleague with him, and died in 1770, aet. 82. Elder Win&s;or's &s;on Samuel &s;uceed|ed
<PB N="397" REF="018336_0412_0FA7AF3C873BE9D8">him in the care of &s;aid church in Providence, from 1759 until 1771, when he and a minor part of the church drew off, on account of differing &s;entiments concerning the doctrines of grace, and &s;inging in public wor&s;hip, then introduced (which was a return to the fir&s;t principles of the church) and he and his followers formed another church in John&s;ton. One of the two churches in Smithfield (mentioned in p. 120) is di&s;&s;olved: Elder John Win&s;or officiates in the other, where Elder Place did; but I have not been favoured with any di&s;|tinct account of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffairs, nor of tho&s;e of the church in Scituate, where Elder Hopkins &s;uc|ceeds Elder Fi&s;k. The like is to be &s;aid of the church in Cumberland, where Elder Ballou &s;uc|ceeds Elder Cooke. The&s;e three churches hold to general redemption, and make laying on of hands a term of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r communion. But Elder Jo&s;eph Win&s;or, &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the fir&s;t Elder Win&s;or in Providence, who &s;ucceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lder Thomas Knowlton in Glouce&s;|ter, is in full fellow&s;hip with our churches. And &s;o is Elder Rufus Tift, who was ordained in North-Providence June 16, 1784, &s;ucce&s;&s;or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Elder Eze|kiel Angell, who died September 27, 1780.</P>
<P N="2">II. OF the mini&s;ters of the fir&s;t and &s;econd churches in Newport, we have before &s;poken (p. 109, 110, 122.) The learned Mr. Callender died there January 26, 1748; and Mr. Upham's &s;ociety at Springfield being &s;mall, he was prevailed with to remove to Newport the next year, where he mini&s;tered the chief of his time until 1771, when he returned to his flock at Springfield, whom he had often vi&s;ited in the mean time. And Mr. Kelly, from Philadelphia, was ordained pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church in Newport, October 9, 1771; and though the war cau&s;ed his removal from them,
<PB N="398" REF="018336_0413_0FA7AF3D2F382668">yet he has &s;ince returned to them again, Elder Wightman, of the &s;econd church there, died Augu&s;t 31, 1750, aet. 82. Elder Eyres was taken from them February 13, 1759, aet. 68, and their pre|&s;ent pa&s;tor, who had often preached to them before, was ordained the 29th of April following. He was almo&s;t the only di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter who con|tinued to preach on the i&s;land through all the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of its being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy; and he has had a precious harve&s;t of &s;ouls there &s;ince. The third church in Newport, who keep the &s;eventh day, began under the mini&s;try of Mr. William Hi&s;cox in 1671, who continued their pa&s;tor until his death, May 24, 1704, aet. 66. El|der William Gib&s;on from London was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and died March 12, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7, aet. 79. Elder Jo&s;eph Crandall had been a colleague with him for two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, and continued their mini&s;ter until he died, September 13, 1737. Elder John Max&s;on was their next mini&s;ter, from 1754 until his decea&s;e, March 2, 1778. Mr. Ebenezer David (who was converted in Providence college, and took his fir&s;t degree there in 1772) belonged to this church; and having been a chaplain much e&s;teemed in our army, died therein not far from Philadelphia, a few days after Mr. Max&s;on. Their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor was ordained a colleague with him.</P>
<P>THE church in Dartmouth (mentioned in p. 18, 73) now have their meeting-hou&s;e and the ma|jority of their members within the bounds of Ti|verton. Elder Tabor died in 1752; after which they had Elder David Round for their mini&s;ter a number of years, and &s;ome others; but it was a dark trying time with them, until a late remark|able revival was granted. Their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor is from Newport. He removed there in the &s;pring
<PB N="399" REF="018336_0414_0FA7AF3DEDF08750">of 1775, but laboured under many di&s;couragements for five years, and then heavy afflictions were made to work for good to him and his people. He was ordained April 13, 1780, and much of a &s;pirit of prayer was granted for the revival of religion; which prayers were an&s;wered in &s;uch a manner, that betwixt the fir&s;t of June that year, and June 27, 1781, ninety members were added to that church. In which time &s;ay they, "We have &s;een as it were many Penteco&s;t days, and enjoyed heaven upon earth: All glory to God forever and ever. The &s;ubjects of the work &s;eem to be of all ages, from fifteen to &s;ixty, and all circum&s;tances of life. They tell clear experiences of a work of grace; and &s;ome who have been profe&s;&s;ors &s;everal years can now tell &s;omething like a new conver&s;ion."</P>
<P N="3">III. WHEN we pa&s;s over the Narragan&s;et Bay, I perceive that the church in South-King&s;town (men|tioned p. 120) has long been di&s;&s;olved; tho&s;e in North-King&s;town and Warwick continue, but my intelligence concerning them is too imperfect to be of any &s;ervice to the public. The like may be &s;aid concerning the &s;eventh day church at We&s;terly and Hopkinton, who continued to act as one church with their brethren of Newport, until they were re|gularly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed therefrom in 1708. The church in the we&s;t part of Warwick, where Elder Worden was ordained (p. 175) is di&s;&s;olved; and after preach|ing for &s;ome time to the church in Coventry (men|tioned p. 202) many of them removed to the place where he is now &s;ettled in Berk&s;hire. The we&s;t part of Coventry, with the adjacent borders of Scituate and Fo&s;ter, had &s;carcely the appearance of religion among them, until Elder Nichols was rai&s;ed up, and made in&s;trumental of a very con&s;iderable reforma|tion in tho&s;e parts, Elder David Sprague died in
<PB N="400" REF="018336_0415_0FA7AF3EC1A52098">Exeter, in 1777, and his &s;on before and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> has been made a very u&s;eful man there. Oliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Bab|cock &s;ucceeded his father in office at We&s;terly. Elder Wightman's &s;on is his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in Groton. The church at New-London (p. 89) is di&s;&s;olved, by means of the ill conduct of their mini&s;ter. The pious Elder Merriman died at Southington la&s;t win|ter, aet 88. Such a revival of religion was granted in Wood&s;tock, in 1780, as added ninety members to the Bapti&s;t church there in le&s;s than two years. And to the honor of Governor Trumbull it is to be remembered, that he has repeatedly interpo&s;ed his influence in favour of that &s;ociety, to relieve them when taxed to the wor&s;hip of their opponents. The pre&s;ent Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter of Suffield was ordain|ed in 1775; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon his labours, that their church increa&s;ed in about a year from &s;ixty to two hundred members. And our principles prevail more and more in all parts of the country; &s;o that we may truly adopt the lan|guage of Mo&s;es's prophetical &s;ong, <HI>for their rock is not our rock, even our enemies them&s;elves being judges.</HI> They have often declared that their mini&s;ters and churches would come down, if they were not &s;up|ported by compul&s;ion. They have now tried that power again&s;t us, and to &s;upport them&s;elves, until it plainly fails them, while our rock &s;tands firm. Let all the glory be given to God therefor. We are &s;o far from de&s;erving any part of it, that like babes we have need again to be taught which are the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. LET us take a brief view of tho&s;e princi|ples, and of the folly of man in departing from them. If we pay any regard to the word of Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t know, that no man can &s;ee his kingdom, nor have right to any <HI>power</HI> therein, without regene|ration;
<PB N="401" REF="018336_0416_0FA7AF3F6DC043D8">and al&s;o that all &s;triving about who &s;hall be the greate&s;t is excluded therefrom, John i. 12, 13, iii. 3, Mat. xviii. 1&mdash;4, xx. 25&mdash;28. Agree|able to which the fathers of New-England were taught, that, "As the kingdom of Chri&s;t is not of this world (John xviii. 36) but &s;piritual, and he a &s;piritual king; &s;o mu&s;t the government of this &s;piritual kingdom, under this &s;piritual king, needs be &s;piritual, and all the laws of it. And as Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath, by the merits of his prie&s;thood (1 Cor. vi. 20) redeemed as well the body as the &s;oul, &s;o is he al&s;o, by the &s;ceptre of his kingdom, to rule and reign over both: Unto which Chri&s;tian magi&s;trates, as well as meaner per&s;ons, ought to &s;ubmit them&s;elves; and the more Chri&s;tian they are, the more meekly to take the yoke of Chri&s;t upon them; and the greater authority they have, the more effectually to advance his &s;ceptre over them&s;elves and their people by all good means. Neither can there be any rea&s;on given, why the merits of &s;aints may not as well be mingled with the merits of Chri&s;t for the &s;aving of his church, as the laws of men with his laws for the ruling and guid|ing of it. He is as ab&s;olute and entire a king as he is a prie&s;t, and his people mu&s;t be as careful to pre&s;erve the dignity of the one, as to enjoy the bene|fit of the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on again&s;t Bernard, p. 38.</NOTE>." And as the teachers in the church of England continued to call bapti&s;m regeneration, as Origen did, and yet the author again&s;t whom Mr. Robin&s;on wrote told of his begetting many of his hearers in Chri&s;t by his preaching, Robin|&s;on &s;aid to him, "Their bapti&s;m was true bapti&s;m, and &s;o the true &s;eal of their forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and new birth, as you affirm p. 119, and this their &s;eal of the new birth hath &s;tood good upon them all this
<PB N="402" REF="018336_0417_0FA7AF416311A170">while, vi&s;ibly and externally; and yet, after all this, you preach unto them and beget them anew, vi&s;i|bly and eternally (for only God knoweth that which is true within.) You have begotten them through the go&s;pel. Behold a mon&s;trous generation! a man begetting children twenty, thirty or forty years af|ter they be born! If Nichodemus had heard of this, he might well have &s;aid, how can the&s;e things be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface, p. 11, 12.</NOTE>!" And how is the folly of others al&s;o now expo&s;ed in our land? In 1638, the year Harvard college was founded, a law was made at Bo&s;ton, to empower the voters in each town (which then were only the com|municants in their churches) to compel every in|habitant therein to contribute proportionably with others, "For upholding the ordinances in the churches, whereof he <HI>doth or may</HI> receive benefit." And becau&s;e a man wrote &s;ome arguments again&s;t this practice, he was fined Ten Pounds; and another was fined Forty Shillings, only for reading the &s;ame before company; and the mini&s;ters &s;aid &s;uch men were "Rather to be taught by cudgel than ar|gument." (Vol. 1, p. 98, 100.) But how is their folly now made <HI>manife&s;t unto all men,</HI> according to God's promi&s;e? 2 Tim. iii. 5&mdash;9. Corrupt mini|&s;ters have done the mo&s;t to promote infidelity and a contempt of revealed religion of any men upon earth. After the&s;e things had broken forth in the nation mo&s;t terribly, in and after the reign of Charles the &s;econd, bi&s;hop Burnet &s;aid, "I am forced to de|clare, that having had much free conver&s;ation with many that have been fatally corrupted that way, they have very often owned to me, that nothing promoted this &s;o much in them, as the very bad opinion which they took up of all clergymen of all &s;ides: They did not &s;ee in them that &s;trictne&s;s of life, that con|tempt
<PB N="403" REF="018336_0418_0FA7AF41ACDC4890">of the world, that zeal, that meekne&s;s, humi|lity and charity, that diligence and earne&s;tne&s;s, with relation to the truths of the Chri&s;tian religion, which they reckoned they would mo&s;t certainly have, if they them&s;elves firmly believed it. Therefore they concluded, that tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was more &s;trictly to enquire into the truth of their religion, knew that it was not &s;o certain as they them&s;elves, for other ends, endeavoured to make the world be|lieve it was. And that, though for carrying on of their own authority or fortunes, which in one word they call their <HI>trade,</HI> they &s;eemed to be very po&s;itive in affirming the truth of their doctrines; yet they in their own hearts did not believe it, &s;ince they lived &s;o little an&s;werable to it, and were &s;o much &s;et on rai&s;ing them&s;elves by it; and &s;o little on advancing the honor of their <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> by an exemplary piety and &s;hining conver&s;ation. This (&s;ays Burnet) is a thing not to be an&s;wered by being angry at them for &s;aying it, or by reproaching &s;uch as repeat it, as if they were <HI>enemies to the church;</HI> the&s;e words of heat and faction &s;ignify nothing to work upon, or con|vince any<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preface to his pa&s;toral care, 1692, p. 12, 23.</NOTE>." And he well ob&s;erves, that a real re|formation is the only effectual remedy. And &s;uch a door is now opened for an exten&s;ive reformation, as never has been before among any people &s;ince the ri&s;e of Antichri&s;t. He ro&s;e and has prevailed by the connexion of the officers of church and &s;tate to|gether, &s;o as to level the terrors both of this and the future world again&s;t all that attempted to re&s;i&s;t their power. But how is that connexion now broken? A learned gentleman in the law publi&s;hed an an|&s;wer la&s;t January, to the mini&s;ter mentioned (p. 353) who tells him plainly, "That a church hath a right, beyond all obligation that human laws can
<PB N="404" REF="018336_0419_0FA7AF429B07EC00">lay upon them, to di&s;mi&s;s their pa&s;tor when they plea&s;e. Churches may advi&s;e churches, and mem|bers may rea&s;on with members; but to advi&s;e will always &s;uppo&s;e, that the advice may be accepted or rejected; and &s;hould it be rejected, I know not to what earthly tribunal the pa&s;tor, as pa&s;tor, could repair with his complaint again&s;t his church.&mdash;The fir&s;t principle in a religious body is, that they will act according to the dictates of a good con&s;cience, advi&s;ing, not controuling one another. There is nothing more plain than that when they con&s;ent to do that which their con&s;ciences di&s;approve, they do <HI>not act as a religious &s;ociety</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strictures upon Thatcher, by J. S. p. 19, 22.</NOTE>." This is a mo&s;t im|portant truth, but how little is it regarded?</P>
<P N="5">V. CAN the con&s;cience of any man approve of his taking away the property of another for no|thing? or requiring him to do much &s;ervice for a community, without any &s;upport or reward? Chri&s;t &s;ays the labourer is worthy of his reward; and his command is, <HI>let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked.</HI> Yet how many are there at this day that make high pretences of regard to a free go&s;pel, and at the &s;ame time treat tho&s;e whom they applaud as true teachers of it wor&s;e than they do their oxen? Not only neglect to communicate good things to them them&s;elves, but hinder others from doing of it. Such an in|&s;tance has been de&s;cribed (p. 116.) And there are per&s;ons now in all parts of the land, who are ready to &s;pit their venom, and if po&s;&s;ible to ruin the characters of all teachers who will not either be tyrants or &s;laves; either be confederate in forc|ing away the property of people for nothing, and wor&s;e than nothing, or el&s;e &s;pend their lives and

The great de&s;ign of religion is to make men ju&s;t and merciful; but how oppo&s;ite thereto is it, to &s;et a man up in a public and expen&s;ive office, expo&s;ed to the re&s;ent|ment of earth and hell, and require him to <HI>go this warfare of his own charges!</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 7&mdash;14. Can any wonder if a cur&s;e is &s;ent upon the ble&s;&s;ings of men who refu&s;e to lay the&s;e things to heart? Mal. ii. 2, iii. 9, 10. Truth and love bring teachers and members to act in union, and to regard each others ca&s;e as their own, which a precious num|ber do in our day; but pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s <HI>cau&s;eth divi&s;ions and offences,</HI> contrary thereto; and all &s;uch are to be <HI>marked and avoided.</HI> Tho&s;e in general who have made u&s;e of &s;ecular force in re|ligious matters have been &s;uch <HI>&s;chi&s;matics</HI> (p. 50) neither can others be free of that guilt, who lay heavy &s;ervice and burthens upon their officers, and will not touch them with one of their fingers.

<P N="6">VI. THAT Chri&s;tianity is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the good order of civil &s;ociety, is a certain truth, (p. 331) but men hold it in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, when they a&s;&s;ume a power to <HI>add</HI> to Chri&s;t's laws about his wor&s;hip. Pretenders to new immediate revela|tions do this as really as &s;tate politicians. Special teachings of the Holy Spirit we all need continual|ly, to give us a right under&s;tanding of the holy &s;criptures, &s;o as to apply and obey them in a right manner; but they are perfect in them&s;elves, and &s;ufficient to furni&s;h the man of God for every good work, when he takes the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> as the true ex|pounders of the <HI>prophets.</HI> On this foundation the Chri&s;tian church was built, Eph. ii. 19, 20. And though <HI>confounding</HI> of them together produced my|&s;tery Babylon, yet when &s;he &s;hall be de&s;troyed that order will be again ob&s;erved, Rev. xviii. 20. Their writings, with the united church of believ|ing Jews and Gentiles built thereon, appear to be the two witne&s;&s;es mentioned in Rev. xi. 3&mdash;15. Directly after their re&s;urrection, the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of Chri&s;t; which undoubtedly intends an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his laws and government. Reference is there had to Zech. iv. 11&mdash;14, which &s;peaks of one candle|&s;tick, of two olive trees, and of <HI>golden oil</HI> com|municated into it through them. There was then but one church; but after the partition wall be|twixt Jews and Gentiles was broken down, <HI>both</HI> have acce&s;s by <HI>one &s;pirit</HI> unto the Father; which &s;pirit is plainly the golden oil communicated to &s;ouls through the word of truth. This united church is the light of the world, and the pillar and
<PB N="407" REF="018336_0422_0FA7AF4502C4B5B0">ground of the truth, Mat. v. 14, 1 Tim. iii. 15. The chief di&s;putes in the world have been whether God's revealed mind is &s;trictly <HI>true?</HI> or if true, how it can be <HI>equal?</HI> The apo&s;tles and prophets, and all hearty believers of their writings, have ever witne&s;&s;ed for both of the&s;e points; but it has long been in &s;ackcloth or mourning. And perhaps when they are killed, and yet the <HI>people</HI> will not permit them to be buried, means when officers become &s;o corrupt that <HI>truth falls in the &s;treet, and equity cannot enter,</HI> though the people will not entirely part therewith. Hereupon Jehovah will ari&s;e and render <HI>vengeance to his enemies according to their deeds;</HI> yea, <HI>recompence to the i&s;lands.</HI> After which the <HI>Re|deemer</HI> &s;hall come to Zion, and to them that <HI>turn from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in Jacob;</HI> who will be e&s;tabli&s;hed in a way of <HI>covenant</HI> obedience to the <HI>words of his mouth,</HI> by the influence of his <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> This prophecy the apo|&s;tle applies to future times, which will be as <HI>life from the dead,</HI> I&s;ai. lix. 14&mdash;21, Rom. xi. 15, 26. Again, becau&s;e it is a mo&s;t important truth that <HI>God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons,</HI> many deny his right to <HI>do what he will with his own grace,</HI> though in a way of per|fect ju&s;tice. He is perfectly ju&s;t in all his di&s;pen|&s;ations, while he <HI>&s;hews mercy to whom he will &s;hew mercy.</HI> And to deny this is to deny him the right which every freeman has with his own property. Oh, madne&s;s! It is al&s;o an e&s;&s;ential truth, that God is LOVE in the ab&s;tract; but it is a fatal delu&s;ion to ima|gine that he loves every individual &s;inner, &s;o as not to inflict endle&s;s puni&s;hment upon &s;uch as die in impenitency. The devils are his creatures, and were a higher order of them than men; yet their endle&s;s puni&s;hment is declared as one evidence again&s;t tho&s;e who turn grace into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, Jude 6. Again, Chri&s;t's fini&s;hed atonement is the
<PB N="408" REF="018336_0423_0FA7AF4689D3FDC0">object of faith, and all our encouragement to come to God by him, is ever to be derived from the re|cord thereof given in the go&s;pel, which is as true before we believe it as afterwards; but it is a mo&s;t deceitful trick to argue from thence, that the true believer is not con&s;cious of an inward change in his &s;oul, &s;o as to be enabled to do &s;uch acts as are <HI>well plea&s;ing to God,</HI> Heb. xiii. 16. When any in I&s;rael were bitten with the fiery &s;erpents, all hope of life was cut off, but only from an object without and above them, to which each of them mu&s;t look, or death was his portion; yet when he looked, a change was wrought <HI>within him;</HI> the poi|&s;on was expelled, and health recovered; and it would have been a wicked thing in any of them not to have rejoiced, and been thankful therefor. Now Chri&s;t him&s;elf explains faith and regeneration here|by, John iii. 14, 15. Yet Robert Sandeman, and James Relly after him, have poi&s;oned the &s;ouls of many with artful repre&s;entations that it is phari&s;a|ical pride for any to tell of inward experiences, and to rejoice in what God had done within them. And the latter of them, by deceitfully repre&s;enting that our own intere&s;t is part of the fir&s;t object of faith, has carried his argument in many minds, that every individual will finally be &s;aved, becau&s;e if it were not &s;o, it could not be a crime not to believe a point which was not true in fact. Whereas in the pa&s;&s;age that he builds mo&s;t upon, a not believing the <HI>record</HI> as it &s;tands in the book is the crime charged; and life is there declared to be <HI>in the Son,</HI> and <HI>given to us,</HI> and al&s;o that none have life but tho&s;e who <HI>have that gift,</HI> 1 John v. 10&mdash;12, Now compare this with Chri&s;t's own words concerning the brazen &s;erpent, and Relly's argument appears as fal&s;e as it would to have argued, that it could not have been a crime
<PB N="409" REF="018336_0424_0FA7AF46ED7494D8">for a poi&s;oned per&s;on to refu&s;e a look to it, unle&s;s healing was as certainly his before as afterwards: No crime to <HI>make light</HI> of the go&s;pel call, unle&s;s the fea&s;t they are called to is certainly theirs, and they may come to it when they plea&s;e; and that God's infinite love obliges him to receive them when|ever they &s;hall cry for it in good earne&s;t, Mat. xxii. 1&mdash;4.

<P N="7">VII. ANOTHER e&s;&s;ential truth of the go&s;pel is, that we mu&s;t daily deny our&s;elves and take up our cro&s;s, or we cannot be Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples: But this truth has often been held in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in every age. The people mentioned p. 209, run to a great length in that way. A man from Charle&s;town, near B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ton, was their head, who about 1758 a&s;&s;umed God's e&s;&s;ential prerogatives in &s;uch a bla&s;phemous manner, that he was complained of to authority, upon which he fled, and his followers concealed him for many years, and a hou&s;e was built for that purpo&s;e in Harvard, where they privately re&s;orted to him, who declared him&s;elf to be perfect and immortal, until death arre&s;ted him, and he was buried with great &s;ecre&s;y. Since which the &s;ame hou&s;e in Harvard has been made the head-quarters of a &s;mall com|pany from Britain, who have a woman for their head. They privately got together in the county of Albany, and formed their &s;cheme; and then in April, 1780, it was &s;uddenly proclaimed, that a new di&s;pen&s;ation was begun, greater than had ever been known in the world before, which all were called to enter into, or they could not be &s;aved. A Pedo|bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in New-Lebanon, and a Bapti&s;t mi|ni&s;ter in Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">sfield, fell into the &s;nare, and many hundreds were drawn into it, in various parts of
<PB N="410" REF="018336_0425_0FA7AF47AE13DE30">Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire and Connecticut. The &s;aid Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in Pittsfield, after being a few months with them, was delivered from that delu&s;ion, and publi&s;hed an account of their &s;cheme, which was printed at Hartford, Norwich, Provi|dence and Bo&s;ton. I was at his hou&s;e in June, 1782, and went with him to vi&s;it a con&s;iderable number of them. They earne&s;tly inculcate that doctrine of devils of <HI>forbidding to marry,</HI> and require &s;o much <HI>bodily exerci&s;e,</HI> in &s;inging and dancing, &amp;c. as has de&s;troyed the health and even the lives of &s;ome; a cruel cro&s;s indeed! while their chief leaders delight them&s;elves much in fea&s;ting and drinking &s;pirituous liquor. I would by no means mi&s;repre&s;ent any of their &s;entiments or conduct; but I have obtained mo&s;t certain evidence that the&s;e &s;even abominations con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ence of their &s;cheme.

Some of them at Norton and el&s;ewhere have carried matters &s;o far this year, as for men and women to dance together entirely naked, to imitate the primitive &s;tate of perfection.

Jemima Wilkin&s;on, born among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Qua|kers in Cumberland, in the county of Providence, being a young woman of a retentive memory, and an eloquent tongue, declares that in October, 1776, &s;he was not only taken &s;ick but actually died, and her &s;oul went to heaven; &s;oon after which, &s;he &s;ays, her body was re-animated by the &s;pirit and power of Chri&s;t; upon which &s;he &s;et out as a public teach|er, and for a while had large a&s;&s;emblies to hear her in various parts of the county of Bri&s;tol, and from thence we&s;tward to New-London. Indeed &s;he has travelled as far as Bo&s;ton on one hand, and Phila|delphia on the other; but her chief followers were within the above limits. A young man, who was an intimate coun&s;ellor of hers for &s;ome years, gives the following account of her, and of how he and other people were en&s;nared by her. He fir&s;t heard her at Tiverton, in 1778, and &s;ays he, "The fir&s;t appearance &s;eemed to be &s;omething &s;ingular and extraordinary, in a habit different from what is com|mon among&s;t women, wearing her hair curled in her neck, without any other covering on her head, ex|cept when &s;he travelled out &s;he put on a hat much like a man's, only with the brim down. Her vi|&s;age a good deal bright, with a very agreeable coun|tenance; her voice very grum and &s;hrill for a wo|man, and &s;eemed pathetical and engaging in her di&s;cour&s;e, in which were abundance of &s;cripture ex|pre&s;&s;ions, though not much explained, or light held up from them; neither did I ever hear her ad|vance much &s;cripture doctrine of the principles of religion, but her exhortation &s;eemed to be very af|fecting, &s;hewing a very &s;edate countenance with &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity, admoni&s;hing all to repent

And &s;he appears zealou&s;ly engaged, and &s;ays &s;he devotes her&s;elf and &s;ervice wholly to the glory of God, and the good of &s;ouls. She exhorts people in a pathetical manner, with great confidence and boldne&s;s; and &s;ays &s;he has an immediate revelation for all &s;he delivers; that &s;he is the greate&s;t mini&s;ter that God has &s;ent to the people the&s;e &s;eventeen hundred and odd years; and advan|cing her&s;elf to live as &s;he exhorts others to, fully in a &s;tate of perfection, with no liability of error or de|fect in any re&s;pect, &s;eems to have great influence upon many &s;erious people; for no one would ra|tionally think that a per&s;on in their right &s;en&s;es would dare to hold forth and affirm &s;uch great and exalted things concerning them&s;elves, unle&s;s it were &s;o in reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brownell upon enthu&s;ia&s;tical errors, 1783, p. 5&mdash;7.</NOTE>." This is a brief view of the &s;ub|&s;tance of his account of her way of proceeding, which brought a number of ignorant people, and &s;ome who have been officers in the State, to follow and cleave to her affectionately, as a per&s;on inve&s;ted with immediate and great power from above, even power to work miracles.

<P N="8">VIII. AND thus I have pointed out &s;ome of the ways wherein men have gone a <HI>whoring with their own inventions</HI> (P&s;al. cvi. 39) which is fixing their affections and dependence thereon, in&s;tead of the God of truth. And though it is a maxim with earthly politicians, that their King can do no wrong, thereby imputing all that is wrong to others, yet they have long taken the oppo&s;ite cour&s;e con|cerning the kingdom of Chri&s;t. All the frauds, oppre&s;&s;ions and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, that have been prac|ti&s;ed under his name, have been ca&s;t upon Chri&s;|tianity it&s;elf; as if becau&s;e men are fal&s;e, therefore God is not true. In&s;tead of owning his ju&s;t autho|rity, they have exalted them&s;elves above him, and have arraigned <HI>his &s;ayings</HI> at their bar, Rom. iii. 4. What he &s;ays concerning the entire depravity of man, and their enmity of heart again&s;t God, they make a chief argument again&s;t the truth of his &s;ay|ings in his written word; and thus they plainly con|firm the truth of it, by their arguments again&s;t it. And becau&s;e errors and here&s;ies more openly break out, where he has poured out his &s;pirit, than where people like Moab are &s;ettled upon their lees, many conclude that it was not his &s;pirit that moved upon the minds of the people; which argument is about as conclu&s;ive as it would be to &s;ay, that the in|fluences of the &s;un are not really good in the &s;pring and &s;ummer, becau&s;e they cau&s;e a very di&s;agree|able &s;tench to ari&s;e from dunghills and dead car|ca&s;&s;es, which we do not &s;mell when the &s;un is at a great di&s;tance, and the&s;e things are hard frozen in the winter; or to &s;ay that the &s;howers of hea|ven are not good, becau&s;e they make the thorns to grow as well as the wheat. The&s;e rea&s;oners

Where is the Governor who required us to &s;ubmit to an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>unlimited power</HI> in man! (Page 289, 290, 364.) God's plan of government is ab&s;o|lutely perfect and immutable; and he has appoint|ed the means and the end, and the means in or|der to the end, in the moral as well as natural world. The means of grace are calculated in in|finite wi&s;dom to open the eyes of men, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Precepts and promi&s;es, re|wards and puni&s;hments, calls and warnings, are all motives to influence the choice of man. And the &s;tronge&s;t hold that the devil has in this world is to per&s;uade man, that a being governed in his choice by motives without him&s;elf, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of moral agents; and to per&s;uade him at the &s;ame time that nece&s;&s;ity obliges God to pardon and &s;ave them, whenever they &s;hall be|come &s;incere penitents. Thus they a&s;&s;ume a &s;o|vereignty to them&s;elves, which they deny to their MAKER; and treat him as a <HI>&s;ervant,</HI> to whom they may &s;ay, <HI>go thy way for this time, and when I have a convenient &s;ea&s;on I will call for thee;</HI> making his choice dependent upon theirs. If motives with|out us do not determine our choice, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for God to govern us; and, as the ex|cellent.

An expre&s;s precept required Saul to de&s;troy Agag, as well as the re&s;t of the Amalakites; and by di&s;obedi|ence thereto he lo&s;t his kingdom and his &s;oul. On the other hand, David knew that God de&s;igned to remove Saul, yet having no precept to kill him, he refu&s;ed to do it, though much provoked thereto, when he had very convenient opportunities to cut him off. And though the prophet Samuel, by immediate direction from above, anointed Da|vid to be king over I&s;rael, yet he never a&s;&s;umed that power but by their free choice and cove|nant; and when this was done by part of them, he made no u&s;e of their arms to compel others to receive him. And when ten tribes revolted from his grand&s;on, who collected an army to bring them under him again, God warned him not to do it, and was obeyed therein. And if a <HI>power of will</HI> oppo&s;ite to the bible had not been dreadfully &s;et up in latter ages, my&s;tery Babylon would not have been drunken with blood as &s;he now is.

<P N="1">I. THE word covenant, when u&s;ed concerning contracts between man and man, includes many ideas that can have no place in the affairs betwixt the creature and his Creator; and &s;o much darkne&s;s has appeared in controver&s;ies upon this &s;ubject, that &s;ome worthy men have thought it be&s;t to adopt the word te&s;tament in&s;tead of covenant in the latter ca&s;e. But a review mu&s;t convince us that
<PB N="417" REF="018336_0432_0FA7AF51AFBF7AF0">we cannot get free of difficulties by this change of words; becau&s;e te&s;tament, when u&s;ed about a fa|ther's will who is ab&s;ent from us, is e&s;&s;entially differ|ent from the will of God, who is ever pre&s;ent, and &s;ees our inmo&s;t thoughts. Yet te&s;tament ever means the will of the te&s;tator expre&s;&s;ed, and al&s;o a free di&s;|po&s;al of his property as he plea&s;eth; which, when well ratified, is as good a title as any in the world, although it would &s;poil it for the legatees to have any hand in forming it. And mutual con&s;ent, with mutual obligations and privileges, are e&s;&s;ential ideas in all covenants. <HI>This do, and thou &s;halt live,</HI> was the language of God to Adam in innocency, with which his heart concurred; and this obligation to love is immutably binding upon all his children, Luke x. 27, 28. To withhold this obedience is to rob both God and man of their right; and God ju&s;tly re|quires every &s;inner to <HI>give again that he had robbed, and to walk in the &s;tatutes of life without committing iniquity.</HI> And the new covenant is the writing the law of love in the believer's heart, which yields a free con&s;ent to it, in the tenor of <HI>I will, and they &s;hall,</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 15, Rom. viii. 3, 4, Heb. viii. 10, 11. All who have this work wrought within them ought to confe&s;s the &s;ame <HI>with their mouths,</HI> and to receive each other as Chri&s;t received them, to the glory of God.

II. GREAT imperfections &s;till remain among us in the&s;e re&s;pects; yet it is thought be&s;t to exhibit to the world a li&s;t of the churches in New-England who profe&s;s the&s;e principles, at lea&s;t &s;o far as not to allow that per&s;ons can be forced into religious co|venants. A few of them admit &s;ome Pedobapti&s;ts to their communion, and it is but a few; neither can that practice la&s;t long, as our opponents know that practice &s;peaks louder than words; and a noted mi|ni&s;ter and church in the county of Plymouth open|ly debarred one of their pious members from their communion la&s;t year, for no other crime than a <HI>be|ing buried in bapti&s;m;</HI> by which act &s;ay they, "She has practically declared infant bapti&s;m a nullity, and this church to be a company of unbaptized per&s;ons."

"As to our Bapti&s;t bre|thren, we are free to hold occa&s;ional communion with &s;uch as are regular churches, and make the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion as above&s;aid, and <HI>acknowledge us to be baptized churches,</HI>" &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaration of &s;aid churches met at Killingly&punc; September 19, 1781, p. 21</NOTE>.

The foundation for learning laid at Providence (men|tioned p. 235) has &s;uffered much in the late war, but the &s;chool appears now again in a promi&s;ing way. All other colleges have been very expen&s;ive to governments, but this has never received any thing in that way (no not to repair damages which government has occa&s;ioned therein) but per&s;onal genero&s;ity laid its foundation, and has been its &s;up|port hitherto. Gentlemen of various denomina|tions, chiefly in the town of Providence, &s;ub&s;crib|ed above Four Thou&s;and Pounds therefor before the college edifice was erected in that town; and con&s;iderable &s;ums have been given &s;ince, e&s;pecial|ly in the year pa&s;t, to augment their library. And as liberal &s;entiments are taught therein, and all de|nominations, who&s;e civil and moral conduct is agree|able, have equal privileges for learning in it, libe|ral communications are earne&s;tly &s;ollicited for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of this in&s;titution.</P>

Having had &s;everal Interviews with divers of the People called Quakers, on the Subject of the fir&s;t Volume of my Hi&s;tory, and finding I have not clearly expre&s;&s;ed their Sentiments and Practices, and &s;ome Facts appearing to me different from what they did when I wrote, I am de&s;irous, with them, to have the Hi&s;tory corrected, and Matters put in &s;uch a Light, that Po&s;terity may not mi&s;|apprehend them: Let the Reader therefore re|ceive the following Correction, as what appears to me mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the Truth, and in Ju&s;tice to that People ought to be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>IN page</HI> 141, <HI>the following extract from John Ty&s;o's letter, "There was nothing</HI> IN <HI>him (i. e. Dr. Increa&s;e Mather, as he &s;aid) that he hoped to be &s;aved by," hav|ing been made by me to manife&s;t an error in Friends re|&s;pecting Chri&s;t within; I would ob&s;erve, that I do not look upon it as an error, provided Chri&s;t without be al&s;o acknowledged, and it be held agreeable to the true &s;en&s;e of John</HI> vi. 56, xvii. 26, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 24, <HI>in which &s;en&s;e I am informed it is held by Friends.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 143, 144, <HI>I have quoted &s;ome of Roger Williams's arguments again&s;t Friends &s;entiments of the</HI> grace of God having appeared, or being manife&s;t|ed to all mankind univer&s;ally; <HI>for their an&s;wer to which arguments, I would refer to Fox, &amp;c. an&s;wer, page</HI> 17&mdash;20, <HI>2d part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 307, <HI>I mentioned that</HI> Quakers <HI>were &s;o called from Fox and his companions trembling and quak|ing before</HI> Gerva&s;e Bennet, a Ju&s;tice in Derby. <HI>I meant not to in&s;inuate, that their trembling on that occa|&s;ion, or others, was occa&s;ioned by the fear of man; neither do I on a review of proofs find &s;ufficient grounds to re|ject Fox's account of their receiving &s;aid name, which follows in the &s;ame page; though it is allowed by Bar|clay,
<PB N="427" REF="018336_0442_0FA7AF6AF9640FF8">as well as Mo&s;heim, that their quaking and trem|bling in other places occa&s;ioned their being commonly called by that name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 321, <HI>I undertake to inform po&s;terity how tho&s;e Quakers behaved under their &s;ufferings; upon a re|view of which it appears ju&s;t to add, that I find, and that by other parts of Cudworth's uncontroverted letter, not quoted by me, that he was turned out of office, as he expre&s;ly &s;ays, "Becau&s;e I had entertained &s;ome of the Quakers at my hou&s;e, that thereby I might be the better acquainted with their principles; the Court profe&s;&s;ing they had nothing</HI> at all <HI>again&s;t me, only in that thing, of giving</HI> entertainment <HI>to the Quakers." And he in|forms us, "That when the Quakers were committed to pri&s;on, they mu&s;t be kept-on coar&s;e bread and water, no Friend may bring them</HI> any thing, <HI>none permitted</HI> to &s;peak with them, <HI>nay, if they have money of their</HI> own, <HI>they may not</HI> make u&s;e of that to relieve them&s;elves; <HI>they have many adherents, and a little to acquaint you with their &s;ufferings, which is grievous unto and &s;ad|dens the hearts of mo&s;t of the precious &s;aints of God; it lies down and ri&s;es up with them, and they cannot put it out of their minds, to &s;ee and hear of poor families deprived of their comforts, and brought into penury and want. As far as I am able to judge of the end, it is to force them from their homes and lawful habitations, and to drive them out of their coa&s;ts.&mdash;As for the means by which they are impoveri&s;hed, the&s;e in the fir&s;t place were &s;crupulous of an oath." This does not appear to be confined to allegiance of fidelity to government, but oaths at large, which principle I under&s;tand they maintain from our Saviour's command, Mat.</HI> v. 34, <HI>I &s;ay unto you &s;wear not at all, &amp;c. "Why then we mu&s;t put in force an old law, that all may take the oath of fidelity;&mdash;they cannot&mdash;then a fine of Five Pounds. On this account thirty-five head of cattle, as I am credibly in|formed, hath been by the authority of the Court taken
<PB N="428" REF="018336_0443_0FA7AF6BB52DE440">from them the latter part of this &s;ummer. A poor weaver that has &s;even or eight &s;mall children, him&s;elf lame in his body, had but two cows, and both taken from him: The Mar&s;hal a&s;ked him what he would do? The man &s;aid,</HI> that God, who gave him them, he doubted not would &s;till provide for him. <HI>To fill up the mea&s;ure yet more full, though to the further emptying of Sandwich men, the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, the fir&s;t Tue&s;day of this in&s;tant, was plea&s;ed to determine fines upon them for meetings, One Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and among others the poor weaver &s;poken of Twenty Pounds, &amp;c." And after his mentioning their not &s;uffering their friends of Rhode-I&s;land to come and trade with them, proceeds, "So that unle&s;s the Lord &s;teps in to their help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in &s;ome way beyond man's conceiving, their ca&s;e is &s;ad and to be pitied, and truly it moves bowels of compa&s;&s;ion in all &s;orts except</HI> tho&s;e in place, who carry it with a high hand to|wards them. <HI>Our bench now is Thomas Prince, Go|vernor, &amp;c." See the letter in Bi&s;hop's hi&s;tory, from page</HI> 168&mdash;177, <HI>or more at large in the &s;econd volume, folio, of the book of &s;ufferings of the Quakers, from page</HI> 191&mdash;195, <HI>which la&s;t I did not &s;ee till &s;ince the pub|lication of the fir&s;t volume of my hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From the foregoing account, and what Bi&s;hop charges upon Governor Prince, viz. "That in thy con&s;cience they were &s;uch a people as de&s;erved to be de&s;troyed, they, their wives, their children, their hou&s;es and lands, with|out pity or mercy:" Which &s;entiment of his again&s;t the Quakers, I am told, is remembered in the family, being handed down to tho&s;e of his po&s;terity now living.&mdash;It mu&s;t therefore be acknowledged, he mu&s;t have had too great a &s;hare in the per&s;ecutions mentioned: And as the per&s;ecuted Norton &s;aid, the</HI> &s;trength of dark|ne&s;s <HI>mu&s;t then have been too unhappily over him. And in ju&s;tice to Humphry Norton's character (which is un|der&s;tood to be le&s;&s;ened by my manner of in&s;erting his let|ter,
<PB N="429" REF="018336_0444_0FA7AF6FF6107440">and treating this &s;ubject, in page</HI> 322 <HI>of my hi&s;to|ry) I think further to manife&s;t his and J. Rou&s;e's be|haviour under their &s;ufferings, by in&s;erting a paragraph in Bi&s;hop's hi&s;tory, page</HI> 179, <HI>which would render my account more intelligible and full. Speaking of the number of la&s;hes, which I mentioned, he adds, "Which as it drew &s;tore of blood, &s;o it took much with the &s;pec|tators, who beheld them in the &s;tocks fir&s;t praying, then &s;aluting each other, and bidding the executioner have patience a little (when he came to take off their cloaths) and he &s;hould &s;ee they could give their backs to the &s;miters." And Bi&s;hop adds, that "They gave in a paper a&s;&s;igning the grounds and rea&s;ons of their return|ing, when they were demanded wherefore they came in, which the magi&s;trates</HI> would not &s;uffer to be read; <HI>and &s;o envious were they, that for taking John Rou&s;e by the hand they put three of the inhabitants of Sand|wich in the &s;tocks." And it appearing by the &s;aid Bi&s;hop's hi&s;tory, and the book of Friends &s;ufferings, that other whippings and per&s;ecutions followed in Plymouth Colony, and that the &s;aid Humphry Norton, under whip|pings and other per&s;ecutions at New-Haven, appears to have behaved in a Chri&s;tian temper, when being loo&s;|ed from the &s;tocks after being whipped, having a great iron key tyed athwart his mouth, and burnt deep in his hand with a red hot iron, "He kneeled down and prayed to the Lord, uttering his voice towards heaven, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of them all."&mdash;The reader is referred thereto for a more particular account.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 323, <HI>I interpreted the figurative expre&s;&s;ions of "Rending the rocks of wi&s;dom and knowledge, and exalting that which is low," as directed again&s;t civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, which I &s;uppo&s;ed they meant to &s;ubject to a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;piritual power in Chri&s;|tians without outward laws and rules: But on further enquiry and conver&s;ation with Friends, I am convinced they thereby referred to the coming of the Lord, by his
<PB N="430" REF="018336_0445_0FA7AF70A1D452F8">&s;piritual work, to level the wi&s;e and great, compared to mountains; and the literal knowledge and meer &s;cola&s;|tic divinity, compared to rocks, as being hard to pene|trate and break; for that which is meek and low to be exalted, even Chri&s;t within the hope of glory.&mdash;In which &s;en&s;e I perceive that pa&s;&s;age is now under&s;tood by Friends.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the &s;ame page I ob&s;erved, on &s;ome preceding extracts from Fox's and Williams's writings, "This opens the plain cau&s;e why they (the Quakers) milita|ted &s;o hard again&s;t other magi&s;trates and government." And in the form of an allegory, in page</HI> 507, <HI>it is &s;aid, "To whom others made fierce oppo&s;ition profe&s;&s;edly from the light within; and their cla&s;hings were &s;o great that &s;everal lives were lo&s;t in the fray." The terms</HI> mili|tate, fierce oppo&s;ition and cla&s;hing <HI>to the lo&s;s of lives, u&s;ed to repre&s;ent the conduct of Friends in tho&s;e days, in re&s;pect to civil government, are too har&s;h to be ju&s;tified by any authenticated facts.&mdash;I conceive it to be e&s;&s;ential to civil government, that the magi&s;trate have a power to inflict corporal puni&s;hments, and al&s;o to &abreve;rm his &s;ubjects to war again&s;t invaders of their rights, and therefore that the teaching of a contrary doctrine in either of the&s;e points, &s;o far as it has influence, tends to ob&s;truct or pull down government; and in no other &s;en&s;e did I ever mean to charge the Quakers with militating again&s;t or ob&s;truct|ing government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I find they allow magi&s;trates to inflict corporal pu|ni&s;hments upon their &s;ubjects, who tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of equity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fox's epi&s;tle to Friends at Nevis, in 1675. Al&s;o, I&s;aac Pennington's works, folio, fir&s;t part, page 323.</NOTE>; but do not approve of arming their &s;ubjects to war again&s;t others. And in all States where they have been, I know nothing but that, as a &s;ociety, they have been either actively obedient thereto, or have pa&s;|&s;ively &s;uffered what they were plea&s;ed to inflict upon them, without plotting again&s;t the government thereof,
<PB N="431" REF="018336_0446_0FA7AF70F9956CB0">or u&s;ing any forcible re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t it. And I de|&s;ire the reader to remember that I mean to correct every thing in my hi&s;tory that &s;eemingly or really contradicts the&s;e ideas, and this character of the &s;ociety.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 324, <HI>I &s;peak of our Lord's direction to his di&s;ciples, Mat. <HI>x. 23,</HI> and of his own conduct towards the Gerge&s;enes, Mat. <HI>viii. 34,</HI> as forming a general rule for us, thence charging &s;ome blame upon tho&s;e Quakers who returned into the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; whereas they now both appear to me to refer to &s;pecial and peculiar ca&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the writings I referred to at the top of page</HI> 327, <HI>I rather think my memory failed me in that re|&s;pect; and as to not having light from &s;cripture, for actions, in the &s;ame page, I find that they &s;uppo&s;e that I&s;aiah <HI>xx. 2,</HI> and Micah <HI>i. 8,</HI> prove, that the women there mentioned might be moved by the divine &s;pirit to do tho&s;e actions; of which the reader is left to judge for him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon a review of page</HI> 325 <HI>and</HI> 462, <HI>compared with their own writings, I find that I had &s;ome mi&s;taken ideas of what they held concerning the light within, and therefore freely refer the reader to their own authors for information in that re&s;pect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I did not mean, in page</HI> 462, <HI>to charge them with calling</HI> darkne&s;s light, <HI>any further than wherein they appeared to be again&s;t allowing others the free liber|ty of examining and by arguments oppo&s;ing &s;entiments which they ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to be erroneous; which, whether they were again&s;t or not, I freely &s;ubmit to the read|er's judgment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Harris is referred to at the bottom of page</HI> 152, <HI>and in page</HI> 457 <HI>is named as a Quaker; I am now convinced that he was not one then, if he ever was; and the word</HI> only, <HI>as I twice u&s;ed it in page</HI> 469, <HI>and once in page</HI> 472, <HI>in a way that &s;eems to acquit Mr. Williams from any blame in his di&s;pute with the Quakers, was more than I intended; for I
<PB N="432" REF="018336_0447_0FA7AF71D64A8EE8">really think there was a great deal of imperfection di&s;covered by him, as well as his opponents, in the management of that di&s;pute; and if he meant to puni&s;h any meerly for their plain u&s;e of thee and thou (which I think he did not) I do not concur with any &s;uch thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In page</HI> 463, <HI>I have not &s;o fully quoted Friends an&s;wer to Roger Williams's objections as might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give an adequate view of both &s;ides of the di&s;pute; therefore I refer my reader to their writings on that &s;ubject, particularly George Fox's an&s;wer to &s;aid objections, page</HI> 155, <HI>and appendix,</HI> 117, 118.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 470, <HI>line</HI> 32, <HI>after the word</HI> &s;entence, <HI>in&s;ert,</HI> viz. blood will be given, <HI>which words are particu|larly marked, as referred to by Grove.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As by the grapes of Sodom and clu&s;ters of Gomorrah, in page</HI> 460, <HI>&s;ome might &s;uppo&s;e I meant to charge the vices, that are couched under tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, upon the Quakers; I here declare that I meant no &s;uch thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perhaps the partiality, in favour of Mr. Cotton, which I mention in page</HI> 471, <HI>was owing to Mr. Cod|dington's particular affection for him, rather than to the cau&s;e there a&s;&s;igned.</HI></P>
