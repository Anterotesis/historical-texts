<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS the de&s;ign of the author of the following pages, is to &s;olicit attention to the proofs in favour of Chri&s;tianity, and not to recommend his own peculiar ideas of it, he has endeavoured, as far as the &s;ubject will admit, to guard again&s;t thru&s;ting forward his own private opinions. What this man believes, or that, is nothing to an enquirer after religious truth. The fountain is open, and who&s;oever will may come, and take of the water of life freely. He is a kind neighbour who directs the &s;tranger, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts the weak; but he who would intrude upon another the water of his pitcher, be it pure or polluted, &s;eeks to beguile him of his right, and honours him&s;elf more than he ought.</P>
<P>The plan of the following Addre&s;s was &s;truck out, and partly executed, before the author &s;aw the Letters which Dr. Prie&s;tley has lately ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Jews. He thought whether that publication might not render this unnece&s;&s;ary: but on peru&s;al, imagined that what was projected might &s;till have its u&s;e; and as &s;ome others have joined in the &s;ame opinion, this is an additional motive (con&s;cious as he is of his deficiencies) to offer it to the Public, hoping that candour will pa&s;s over tho&s;e defects, which greater experience may di&s;cover; and praying that the ble&s;&s;ing of God may make it the means of promoting Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>YE children of Abraham, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, permit a &s;tranger affectionately to &s;olicit your attention to matters of the highe&s;t concern both to you and the Gentile nations.</P>
<P>Long has been the captivity, and &s;ore the afflictions which your tribes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ve endured. Surely then it is time to awake to &s;erious con&s;i|deration, and to enquire wherefore it is that the anger of God again&s;t you &s;till endures. Doubt|le&s;s there is a cau&s;e which bears a ju&s;t proportion to your &s;ufferings; for the Lord doth not afflict willingly the children of men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lam. iii. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>As A&s;&s;yria of old was the rod in God's hand to cha&s;ti&s;e your fathers, till they &s;hould acknow|ledge their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and turn to him; &s;o the more modern nations (though the &s;in of their conduct is not hereby extenuated) have been the in&s;truments of inflicting upon you the divine di&s;plea&s;ure. The folly and the wrath of man has been made to prai&s;e the righteous go|vernment of God. Great indeed have been the evils which you have endured from the &s;everal nations, Heathen, Mahometan, and Chri&s;tian: and though, in general, they have now adopted maxims of government more humane, and your
<PB N="2" REF="028290_0005_0FD87E3843CA7198">&s;ufferings are in a mea&s;ure abated (which, it may be hoped, is the prelude of your deliver|ance, and the token of God's returning mercy) yet your captivity continues, and Jeru&s;alem is trodden down of the Gentiles. But where is the humiliation and deep repentance, which, according to the prophets, &s;hall be the forerun|ners of your deliverance, and which God &s;hall reward with &s;uch manife&s;tations of his favour as no nation has ever experienced? Are not the mo&s;t thinking among you con&s;trained to la|ment, that your repentance is not more mani|fe&s;t, and that you apply your&s;elves with no more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s to enquire the cau&s;e of God's anger? Was not the illumined eye of prophecy directed towards your tribes, to ob&s;erve your conduct in the&s;e la&s;t days, when the prophet &s;aid, <Q>The Lord hath poured upon him the f ury of his anger, and the &s;trength of battle; and it hath &s;et him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>What was the covenant which God made with your fathers? To Abraham he promi&s;ed, <Q>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee: and I will give unto thee, and to thy &s;eed after thee, the land wherein thou art a &s;tranger, all the land of Canaan for an ever|la&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I will be their God<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 7.8.</NOTE></Q> By Mo&s;es he &s;aid, <Q>If thou &s;halt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to ob&s;erve and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day; the Lord thy God will &s;et thee on high above all nations of the earth. But it &s;hall come to pa&s;s if thou wilt not hearken, that all the&s;e cur&s;es &s;hall come upon thee; cur&s;ed &s;halt thou be in the city, and cur&s;ed &s;halt thou
<PB N="3" REF="028290_0006_0FD8811C9BF48E20">be in the field. And the Lord &s;hall &s;catter thee among all people, from one end of the earth even unto the other.&mdash;And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s when all the&s;e things are come upon thee, and thou &s;halt call them to mind among all the na|tions whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, and &s;halt return unto the Lord thy God, and &s;halt obey his voice, then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compa&s;|&s;ion upon thee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxviii. 1, 15, 16, 64. Deut. xxx. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.</Q> For your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion the Lord hath &s;cattered you; and till you repent and turn to him, you can entertain no well-grounded hope of his favour.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> length of time which has elap&s;|ed &s;ince your c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y and temple were de&s;troyed, and you bani&s;hed from your country; con&s;ider|ing the evils which you have and do &s;till, in a mea&s;ure, endure; and the felicity which awaits you, when you return unto the Lord, and obey his voice, it is &s;urely worth while to &s;et your&s;elves earne&s;tly to enquire, with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and can|dour, into the cau&s;e of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and wherefore it is that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath not heard your groan|ings, as he did tho&s;e of your fathers in Egypt, and remembered his covenant with Abraham, with I&s;aac, and with Jacob: for be a&s;&s;ured he is faith|ful to his promi&s;e, and no length of time can in|validate his covenant. He is waiting that he may be gracious, and that he may have mercy upon you<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxx. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent di&s;per&s;ion, and that hope which the promi&s;es of God give you of <HI>temporal</HI> pro&s;|perity, when you &s;hall repent and &s;eek the Lord with your whole heart, are motives to induce you to &s;earch and &s;ee what tho&s;e &s;ins are which have brought upon you &s;uch unparalleled marks of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and which prevent the accom|pli&s;hment
<PB N="4" REF="028290_0007_0FD8811DEDAE2B08">of the promi&s;es; but <HI>that guilt</HI> which &s;in unrepented of brings upon the &s;oul, and tho&s;e <HI>un&s;peakable evils</HI> to which it expo&s;es you in the world to come, pre&s;ent to you &s;till &s;tronger mo|tives to apply your&s;elves to this work. Tho&s;e temporal &s;ufferings which may be endured in this life, are but the &s;hadow of that di&s;plea&s;ure which pur&s;ues the guilty into the world of &s;pirits. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, it is highly probable that you have not yet di&s;covered the principal cau&s;e of God's anger, and con&s;equently have not acknowledged it before him: had you done &s;o, we may be &s;ure that the merciful and faithful God would long ere this have turned your captivity, and have had mercy upon you. Enquire therefore why your God &s;o long contendeth with you.</P>
<P>Whether the Chri&s;tian religion (not as held forth in the creeds of erring men, but as contained in our &s;acred &s;criptures) be from God or of man, is &s;urely worthy of attentive examination. What I would reque&s;t of you is, not to condemn what you have never examined, but to be&s;tow upon the &s;ubject that &s;erious and unbia&s;&s;ed attention, which both its own nature and your peculiar cir|cum&s;tances demand.</P>
<P>Seeing that your pre&s;ent captivity was foretold by him whom Chri&s;tians acknowledge as the Me&s;|&s;iah<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxi. 33&mdash;44. xxiii. 34&mdash;39. xxiv.</NOTE>; &s;eeing that it took place from the days he announced; examine whether it be not for reject|ing him, and continuing in oppo&s;ition to his king|dom. At lea&s;t, it is worth the trouble of enquiry. And the more &s;o, as our &s;acred &s;criptures<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi.</NOTE>, while they declare your temporary rejection to be for un|belief hold forth promi&s;es of your re&s;toration when you &s;hall repent and believe. When this event &s;hall take place, the prophecies in our &s;criptures declare, that then &s;hall be accompli&s;hed the glorious things
<PB N="5" REF="028290_0008_0FD8811F33A21BF0">foretold in yours. Your rejection till &s;uch an event being thus affirmed, when no human fore|&s;ight could po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover it; and all circum|&s;tances, even to the pre&s;ent di&s;tant day, in&s;tead of at all di&s;crediting the prophecy, uniting to e&s;|tabli&s;h its authenticity; &s;hould, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, induce you, as rea&s;onable men, &s;o far to lay a&s;ide your prejudice, as to enquire &s;eriou&s;ly whether your fathers may not have fallen into an error, and whether there may not be more evidence for the truth of Chri&s;tianity than you have hitherto been willing to think. Seeing that the prediction re&s;pecting your rejection is verified, it is, at lea&s;t, &s;uch a pre&s;umption in favour of the in&s;piration of the promi&s;e of grace, when you &s;hall believe, as &s;hould incline you to a candid enquiry: and I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, by and by, that your own prophets have predicted the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>And are there not many other rea&s;ons, which ought to induce you to examine this matter with the greate&s;t attention? Such as that general ex|pectation of the Me&s;&s;iah which prevailed about &s;eventeen or eighteen hundred years ago, and which has prevailed more or le&s;s ever &s;ince; from whence many pretenders have &s;et up for the ex|pected deliverer; and who have been followed, till their impo&s;ture has been made manife&s;t. And what is recorded of your Rabbi Elias, who lived about two hundred years before the appearance of Je&s;us, is an argument in favour of that enquiry which I would urge upon you. He &s;aid (no mat|ter from whence he derived his intelligence) he &s;aid the world was to &s;tand &s;ix thou&s;and years be|fore the great &s;abbath, two thou&s;and before the law, two thou&s;and under the law, and two thou|&s;and under the Me&s;&s;iah. The la&s;t two thou&s;and are nearly gone, and no Me&s;&s;iah hath appeared, if Je&s;us be not he; if he be, then we &s;ee (thus
<PB N="6" REF="028290_0009_0FD88120B0AE1CC8">far) the accompli&s;hment of this prediction; and the cleare&s;t light is thrown upon many of the pro|phecies; &s;uch as the &s;eventy weeks of Daniel, the glory of the &s;econd temple, &amp;c. If Je&s;us be the Chri&s;t, then the&s;e two thou&s;and years are employ|ed for the enlightening of the Gentiles, and ful|filling the other prophecies. And though I&s;rael, for the &s;in of rejecting him, has been in bondage the&s;e &s;eventeen hundred years, yet this does not di&s;courage us from hoping in the promi&s;es, Ye &s;hall be gathered, before the con&s;ummation of all things, to the feet of the Me&s;&s;iah, and he &s;hall be your King to &s;ave you. Yes, we may hope that his favour, as the light, in breaking upon you, and that the day is not very far off, when the voice of mercy &s;hall &s;ay, <Q>Awake and &s;ing ye that dwell in the du&s;t, for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth &s;hall ca&s;t out the dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxvi. 19.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash;But however this may be, all the&s;e things put together form a powerful argument to induce you to an at|tentive examination.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, to the reproach of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, that through the impiety of their lives, their corruptions of the Chri&s;tian doctrine, their intolerance towards each other, and their per&s;e|cutions of your nation, they have contributed not a little towards perpetuating your abhorrence of their profe&s;&s;ion; yet, &s;eeing the&s;e are not the te&s;t of the truth or fal&s;ehood of our &s;criptures, any more than the idolatry and other bad practices of your forefathers were of the truth or fal&s;ehood of the laws of Mo&s;es; you are not hereby ju&s;tified in continuing to reject Je&s;us as the Me&s;&s;iah, with|out examining the proofs which lie before you. If you have no better rea&s;ons for rejecting Chri&s;|tianity than tho&s;e derived from the practices of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, you might as well reject re|ligion in every form, and deny that God ever &s;poke
<PB N="7" REF="028290_0010_0FD881222A2B6CE8">to man&mdash;to the law and to the te&s;timony. Com|pare our &s;criptures with yours; try the matter by the &s;evere&s;t rules; &s;ee with your own eyes; judge with your own under&s;tandings; and then &s;ay, af|ter di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry, whether the religion of Je&s;us bears tho&s;e marks of impo&s;ture which you have been u&s;ed to think it does.</P>
<P>Free and unbia&s;&s;ed enquiry is the glory of hu|man nature. To be a Heathen, a Jew, or a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e our fathers were &s;o, is unbe|coming any rea&s;onable creature, arrived at years of under&s;tanding. That man is of no religion who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is not from conviction, and there can be no conviction but from enquiry. He who grounds his faith on the authority of others, and then &s;tudies only for confirmation, &s;eeks not truth by the light of truth, and is therefore ever liable to embrace fal&s;ehood; and &s;hould he be &s;o very fortu|nate as to embrace truth, in him it is no virtue.&mdash; Ri&s;e, then, O man, who art created after the image of thy God; &s;eek truth, and thou &s;halt find her; for|&s;ake her not, and &s;he &s;hall pre&s;erve thee; love her, and &s;he &s;hall keep thee.</P>
<P>But, what is nece&s;&s;ary to a fair enquiry after truth? What is indi&s;pen&s;able to your inve&s;tiga|tion of Chri&s;tianity, that you may form the conclu&s;ion of virtuous men, and know whether it be of God or no? Humility, candour, a di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate temper, the love of truth, and the love of God. Do the&s;e guide and warm your hearts? Come, then; Religion ri&s;es to meet you; her books are open.</P>
<P>No man in this enquiry (if he bring with him a heart rightly di&s;po&s;ed) need de&s;pair of finding the good and right way; for &s;urely that Reli|gion which comes from God, carries with it an evidence which is di&s;cernible by the mo&s;t &s;imple and unlettered, who&s;e minds are not corrupted
<PB N="8" REF="028290_0011_0FD88122DFB18A68">by vice, or warped by prejudice. But let all, while they attend to that evidence which is held forth in the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian &s;criptures, &s;eek to God, by earne&s;t &s;upplications, for his &s;pirit to teach them to profit, and to lead them by the way they &s;hould go<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xlviii. 17.</NOTE>: For that heart which is un&s;ea&s;oned with the &s;alt of grace, and a &s;tranger to &s;erious devotion, is utterly unfit for the enquiry before us.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t requi&s;ite (next to a devout &s;pirit) to a right enquiry after truth, is <HI>humility.</HI> We mu&s;t ever de&s;pair of that man's errors being rec|tified, who is &s;o confident that he is right, that he will give no ear to any thing which oppo&s;es his opinions; nor allow any force in arguments, however cogent, which may tend to &s;hake the foundation on which his &s;y&s;tem is built. When any pretender to religion has adopted certain articles of faith, and laid them down as un|que&s;tionable truths, and will not allow of his liability to mi&s;take; nor attend to any rea&s;on|ings, or proofs, which go to &s;how him his er|ror; <HI>his</HI> mind is in a &s;tate the mo&s;t unfit for the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P>Would you examine the evidence for, and again&s;t, the Chri&s;tian religion, with that tem|per of mind which the ca&s;e de&s;erves, you mu&s;t think of tho&s;e articles of your faith, which you have been u&s;ed to lay down as unque&s;tionable truths (&s;uch, for in&s;tance, as relate to a &s;uffer|ing Me&s;&s;iah) with that humblene&s;s of mind, which becomes men liable to err. Where is the man who is &s;o enlightened as to be able to pene|trate through all the darkne&s;s which hangs over many of the prophecies, e&s;pecially before their fulfilment? For we are to remember, that pro|phecy, in general, is not meant as hi&s;tory, to give us clear and &s;pecific ideas of the per&s;ons or
<PB N="9" REF="028290_0012_0FD8812971C4FB68">things &s;poken of. Here, no more is revealed than is nece&s;&s;ary to encourage the hopes of God's &s;ervants, and identify the per&s;ons and things when they appear; and thus bear witne&s;s to the truth of God's word. The general contents of a prophecy may be very intelligible, yet the ap|plication of it to time and per&s;ons may be very uncertain. There mu&s;t be ob&s;curity in a pro|phecy, as well as &s;hade in a picture; all its lines mu&s;t not &s;tand in a full light; for if the pro|phecies were open and barefaced as to all their parts and circum&s;tances, they would ob&s;truct the cour&s;e of human affairs, and hinder, if it were po&s;&s;ible, their own accompli&s;hment. Mo|de&s;ty and &s;obriety are in all things commend|able, but in nothing more than in the explica|tion of the&s;e &s;acred my&s;teries. Surely a man mu&s;t read but little, and think le&s;s, who does not feel him&s;elf con&s;trained to acknowledge that many of the prophecies are hard to be under|&s;tood. No man of humility, while he &s;tands on the brink of this va&s;t aby&s;s, but mu&s;t hide his face and cry, <Q>O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God! How un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out! Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his coun&s;el|lor?</Q> &mdash;It is not for any man to &s;ay, when God promi&s;es a Saviour to the world (for to the race of Adam he was promi&s;ed before the call of Abraham, or the promi&s;e that he &s;hould be of his &s;eed; as well as after by the mouth of the holy Prophets, who announced him as the light of the Gentiles, as well as the Redeemer of I&s;rael) it is not for any man to &s;ay, when God promi&s;es a Saviour to the world, under what character, or variety of characters, he is to ap|pear, till God him&s;elf makes it known. His
<PB N="10" REF="028290_0013_0FD8812BC5AF2F58">appearance may be the rever&s;e of that which hu|man wi&s;dom &s;ugge&s;ts: for the wi&s;dom of men is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God. But by the prophecies, (hard as many of them are to be under&s;tood, e&s;pecially before their fulfilment throws light upon them) God has made known to his church the characters which his Anointed is to &s;u&s;tain. But a teachable humility is an indi&s;pen&s;able re|qui&s;ite to a right under&s;tanding of them.</P>
<P>If any man &s;ay, "My &s;entiments of the Me&s;|&s;iah's character are certainly right, and mu&s;t not for a moment be called in que&s;tion;" then, in this ca&s;e, whatever the Prophets may teach, mu&s;t bend to preconceived opinion, how|ever great the violence. This &s;tate of mind is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to fair enquiry; and he who is in an error, mu&s;t be in an error &s;till. Nothing can &s;ave him. The preaching of an archangel would not illuminate his mind.</P>
<P>But, do you feel tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions of humi|lity, which teach you to be diffident where there is a po&s;&s;ibility of erring? Is your heart di&s;po&s;ed to bow implicitly to the Revelation of God, without regard to preconceived opinion? Is any man among&s;t you praying, <Q>O Lord, who can under&s;tand his errors? Clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults. As a &s;inful man, I am prone to err, and ever in danger from the deceptions of prejudice.&mdash;Thy coun&s;els, O Lord, are a great deep. As a child, I be&s;eech thy Spirit to in&s;truct me. That which I know not teach thou me, and I will keep it unto the end.</Q> Furni&s;hed with the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of mind, truth is not far from you. Seek, and ye &s;hall find.</P>
<P>And need I intreat the wi&s;e to lay a&s;ide that <HI>national pride</HI> and <HI>prejudice</HI> which puts men up|on ju&s;tifying whatever their ance&s;tors may have done? Need I intreat you to do all you can to|ward
<PB N="11" REF="028290_0014_0FD87E26EA80D818">dive&s;ting your&s;elves of that extravagant opinion which all men are too apt to entertain of tho&s;e who have appeared in favour of their own &s;entiments, to the utter neglect and contempt of all &s;uch as may have appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; as if with the&s;e there could be neither wi&s;|dom nor virtue?

<HEAD>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MESSIAH, FROM THE ANCIENT PREDICTIONS OF THE PROPHETS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be expected that the great Anointed of God, the works which he is to per|form, and the &s;alvation which he is to bring, will occupy the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed place in prophecy, and be the chief theme of in&s;piration. This was the idea of the ancient Jews; hence when jealous Herod was informed of the birth of the King of the Jews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. ii. 4.</NOTE>, he gathered together the chief prie&s;ts and &s;cribes of the people, who might be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t &s;killed in the my&s;teries of the &s;acred books, and demanded of them where Chri&s;t &s;hould be born. And they &s;aid unto him, <Q>In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Micah v. 2.</NOTE></Q> &amp;c. And that this was the idea of the ancient Jews appears from the Talmud, which &s;ays that all the pro|phecies of the Prophets related to Chri&s;t. But, is it not a truth much to be lamented, that &s;ince
<PB N="20" REF="028290_0023_0FD8813F1D1EA2B8">the days of Je&s;us, tho&s;e who have been prejudiced again&s;t him, exerting all their ingenuity to give to the prophecies &s;uch explanations as might lea&s;t agree with his character and doctrine, have thus well nigh &s;hut him out of the holy &s;crip|tures? So that tho&s;e prophecies which mo&s;t ob|viou&s;ly refer to him, are made to terminate in the Prophet who &s;peaks, or in Jo&s;iah, Zerubba|bel, Jo&s;hua the high prie&s;t, Cyrus, or any other per&s;on, the mo&s;t unlikely; as Hircanus, whom Herod &s;lew; Agrippa the younger, &amp;c. It much intere&s;ts you, therefore, to examine the &s;acred writings with your own under&s;tandings, and to con&s;ider well, whether many of tho&s;e prophecies which your writers make to refer to others, do not point to the Me&s;&s;iah. And in many ca&s;es, where inferior characters and events may be the ground-work of what the Prophets &s;peak, it is worth while to con&s;ider whether the Me&s;&s;iah be not the ultimate object in whom the principal matters terminate. It agreeing not with the de&s;ign of prophecy that its whole mean|ing &s;hould lie unconcealed, we find that many of the prophecies are of a mixed nature, and point to two objects at once, or &s;peak of one as the type of another. Thus predictions, re|lating to the return from Babylon, under the edicts of Cyrus and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, are mixed with others which re&s;pect your return and glory in the la&s;t days, and one is made the type of the other. Thus David often &s;peaks of <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as a type of the Saviour who was to come; and in like manner the Prophets often &s;peak of others. The prophecies are a &s;ort of enigmas, which nothing but the accompli&s;hment can ex|plain; with this key, all the my&s;tery is laid open, and he who runs may read&mdash;with the&s;e ideas re&s;pecting the prophetic writings, let us candidly

<P N="4">IV. As the Me&s;&s;iah was to be a Prophet of the highe&s;t rank (and more than a Prophet) may it not be expected, that in proof of his mi&s;&s;ion he
<PB N="27" REF="028290_0030_0FD88150EC85A0F8">&s;hould perform miracles, and prophecy of things to come? It is evident that the ancient Jews expected that their Me&s;&s;iah would do many wonderful works; hence &s;ome &s;aid unto Je&s;us, <Q>What &s;ign &s;hewe&s;t thou unto us, &s;eeing that thou doe&s;t the&s;e things<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John ii. 18.</NOTE>?" and others &s;aid, When Chri&s;t cometh, will he do more mira|cles than the&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 38.</NOTE>?</Q> Perhaps it was in refer|ence to the&s;e prophetic gifts that it was &s;aid, <Q>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy Power<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cx. 3.</NOTE></Q> And again, the <Q>Spirit of the LORD &s;hall re&s;t upon him, the Spirit of wi&s;|dom and under&s;tanding, the &s;pirit of coun&s;el and might, the &s;pirit of knowledg and of the fear of the LORD<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xi. 2.</NOTE></Q> &amp;c. But whether the Prophets have directly &s;poken of this or not, it is &s;urely perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his character thus to be inve&s;ted with power from on high, (and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;ary) to demon&s;trate that he is of God. It may be ju&s;tly expected that he who is repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t eminent Prophet, the great burthen of prophecy, of whom in&s;pira|tion hath &s;poken and &s;ung from the depths of antiquity, &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed with gifts &s;u|perior to others<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Dr. Prie&s;tley &s;peaks of the miracles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as in|ferior, in point of magnitude and &s;plendour, to tho&s;e of Mo&s;es, The ju&s;tne&s;s of this conce&s;&s;ion might be di&s;puted.

<P>An impo&s;tor might &s;hew juggling &s;igns and wonders, which might deceive the ignorant; or, perhaps, by the agency of evil &s;pirits (who may be able to look farther into cau&s;es and ef|fects than men) he might be able to di&s;cover
<PB N="28" REF="028290_0031_0FD8815233299090">events which lay hid from common eyes, and by tho&s;e &s;igns might lead the people after &s;trange gods, as Mo&s;es forewarned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xiii. 1.</NOTE>. God might per|mit the&s;e things as the trial of obedience. But, did ever any impo&s;tor rai&s;e the dead, or give &s;ight to one who was born blind? Such won|ders as the&s;e require the agency of the Creator, and which was never granted to a deceiver. If miracles, which nothing but the power of God can perform, be any proof of a true Prophet, here proof abounds. By a touch, by a word, by the efficiency of his will, he healed all man|ner of di&s;ea&s;es, ca&s;t out devils, controled the elements, and rai&s;ed the dead.</P>
<P>None pretend to deny that Je&s;us wrought many wonderful works, far tran&s;cending hu|man power. So irre&s;i&s;tible is the proof of it, that your nation have been obliged to allow it. Many who &s;aw them, indeed, &s;aid <Q>He ca&s;teth out devils, through the prince of the devils<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. ix. 34.</NOTE>,</Q> and others, to get rid of the argument, which is drawn from hence in favour of his being from God, have pretended that he did them by means of &s;ome ineffable name of Jehovah. But &s;urely, it is too irrational (not to &s;ay too impious) to &s;uppo&s;e, that the great Eternal would permit his name to be turned into a tali&s;man to favour the tricks of a juggling impo&s;tor; or that a few letters, however arranged, or however pro|nounced, &s;hould have in them the power of healing di&s;ea&s;es, and rai&s;ing the dead. This might do in the very darke&s;t ages of &s;uper&s;tition; but have not all men, where revelation, rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, have carried their light, learnt more wi&s;dom? Surely that poor man who was born blind rea&s;oned better than this, when they of the Sanhedrim &s;aid unto him, <Q>We know

"It is marvellous indeed that <HI>you,</HI> great and learned men, &s;hould not know from whence this man is, who hath wrought &s;uch a miracle; when <HI>we</HI> unletter|ed and blind beggars know, that the holy and Almighty God is not the accomplice of deceivers; <HI>we</HI> know that &s;uch power, as in this ca&s;e is manife&s;ted, is communicated only to them who are the true &s;ervants of God.</Q> Ah! man, thou knowe&s;t not the power of pre|judice, or thou would&s;t marvel at nothing.

<P>And is the gift of foretelling future events a criterion of a true Prophet, and what may be expected to dwell in the Me&s;&s;iah in an eminent manner? In Je&s;us we find the Spirit of the Lord, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding. He perceived the thoughts of mens hearts. He knew beforehand who would betray him. His eye penetrated into the depths of futurity, and &s;aw through the future fortunes of the Jewi&s;h nation. What meant he to teach the Jews by his parable of the hu&s;bandmen who fir&s;t refu&s;ed to render unto the hou&s;eholder the fruit of his vineyard, and afterward murdered his only

<P N="5">V. However great and numerous the proofs of the Me&s;&s;iah's mi&s;&s;ion, yet they are not to be attended with that terror which prevailed at Sinai.

Though it a&s;toni&s;h, it does not affright; and if to confirm his mi&s;&s;ion he di&s;play the power of God, yet it is in a way which accords with the promi&s;e.

<P>You have doubtle&s;s been taught to give &s;uch explanations to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, as may lea&s;t favour the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e.

Judah hath &s;hared the &s;ame fate with Ephraim, and the &s;ceptre is departed; but before their po|lity was utterly broken, and they &s;cattered over the face of the whole earth, Je&s;us appeared to gather together in him&s;elf all people, Jews and Gentiles. And, exactly at the time foretold by Daniel, he made his appearance, and was cut off, but not for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To get rid of the argument which this pa&s;|&s;age offers, in favour of Je&s;us being the Chri&s;t, your writers have explained it as not referring to the promi&s;ed BRANCH of David; though
<PB N="39" REF="028290_0042_0FD88165184B6FC8">they are not agreed among them&s;elves of whom the Prophet &s;peaks. Some by the Me&s;&s;iah, in the 25th ver&s;e, under&s;tand Zerubbabel, others Jo&s;hua the high prie&s;t, and a third cla&s;s interpret it of Cyrus. By Me&s;&s;iah, in the 26th ver&s;e, who was to be out off, &s;ome under&s;tand Hircanus the high prie&s;t, whom Herod ordered to be put to death; and others, king Agrippa, who, they &s;ay, was out off by Ve&s;pa&s;ian. But is not this contra|ry to the plain meaning of the text, and offering it the greate&s;t violence? It is evident, to every unbia&s;&s;ed reader, that one per&s;on is &s;poken of through the prophecy. The number of weeks that were to pa&s;s, before the appearance of Me&s;|&s;iah the Prince, prove that neither Zerubbabel, Jo&s;hua nor Cyrus, could be the per&s;on referred to. From the order to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;a|lem, unto the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince, were to be &s;even weeks, and three&s;core and two weeks, i. e. &s;ixty|nine weeks: but which is thus broken into two periods, to mark out the important event of Je|ru&s;alem's re&s;toration, and the time it &s;hould take to perfect that work, viz. &s;even weeks (forty|nine years.) But, even &s;uppo&s;ing the Prophet to &s;ay, <Q>It is &s;even weeks to the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince;</Q> this does not agree with either of the&s;e per&s;ons. Read. <Q>From the going forth of the commandment (either that recorded in Ez|ra i. vi. or vii.) to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;a|lem, &s;hall be &s;even weeks." It is not "From the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of Jeru&s;alem to the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince," but, "From the going forth of the commandment to <HI>re&s;tore</HI> and <HI>build</HI> it, to the Me&s;&s;iah</Q> &amp;c. Who (under God) &s;ent forth the commandment? Cyrus, Darius, or Artax|erxes. And to whom was it given as the heads of the Jewi&s;h nation? Was it not to Zerubbabel, Jo&s;hua, or Ezra?

<P>The Me&s;&s;iah, mentioned in the 26th ver&s;e, which &s;ome interpret of Hircanus, and others of Agrippa, is &s;urely no other than the per&s;on &s;poken of in the preceding ver&s;e. Nothing can be plainer. But is not the per&s;on here pointed out of more eminence than either of the&s;e? Was Hircanus the mo&s;t holy? or did his cutting off make reconciliation for iniquities, and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s? Did he confirm the covenant with many for one week? Critici&s;m and prejudice may make the text applicable to any body, or &s;peak any thing which may an&s;wer a purpo&s;e; but look on the face of it, and &s;ay who&s;e likene&s;s it bears. As to Agrippa, he does not appear to be of eminence enough to be thus &s;poken of; and of his cutting off there is not &s;ufficient proof, and none at all for the ends and con&s;equences of it mentioned in the prophecy. When expo&s;itors are reduced to &s;uch contradic|tions and glaring ab&s;urdities, is it not a rea&s;on, at lea&s;t, to examine candidly, whether Je&s;us, in who&s;e hi&s;tory and preten&s;ions the prophecy meets with the ea&s;ie&s;t &s;olution, be not the per&s;on pointed out? The Me&s;&s;iah was to appear after &s;ixty-nine weeks; then did Je&s;us appear.&mdash;He was to be cut off, but not for him&s;elf, &s;o was it with Je&s;us.&mdash; He was to fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make an end of &s;in, to make reconciliation, and to bring in ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="41" REF="028290_0044_0FD8816BB7E7A540">righteou&s;ne&s;s; and this, the Chri&s;tian doc|trine teaches us, Je&s;us did.&mdash;He was to confirm the covenant with many for one week; this Je&s;us did, by the mini&s;try of his forerunner and of him|&s;elf. &mdash;And then was the people of the prince to come and de&s;troy the city and &s;anctuary, as did the Romans in le&s;s than forty years after the cut|ting off of Je&s;us. If this be not a prophecy of the Me&s;&s;iah, the BRANCH of David, the Prince of princes, where &s;hall we find a promi&s;e of him which may not be quibbled away?</P>
<P>And if Je&s;us be not the per&s;on, where &s;hall we find in the records of hi&s;tory that <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of all nations, who&s;e pre&s;ence was to fill the &s;econd temple with glory? This temple has been long &s;ince de&s;troyed, and not one &s;tone left upon another to denominate it the &s;ame. And where do we find the fulfilment of the promi&s;e of re|markable peace, if not in that doctrine of peace which was preached by and through Je&s;us? that doctrine who&s;e gentle &s;tream ble&s;&s;es the &s;ouls of the righteous with peace, amid&s;t all the agitating tumults and troubles of the world. Surely this is that De&s;ire of all nations who was to come and &s;peak peace to them who are near, and to them who are afar off.</P>
<P>Having advanced thus far in your enquiries after the characteri&s;tics of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the preten&s;ions of Je&s;us, &s;top, and con&s;ider well the weight of evidence for and again&s;t. And let it be remembered, that it is nothing to the pur|po&s;e, that in <HI>&s;ome</HI> in&s;tances you may &s;uppo&s;e the prophecies mi&s;applied; or, at lea&s;t, that they will bear a different interpretation; or that you may think you di&s;cover <HI>&s;ome</HI> things in the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us which accord not with the prophecies, or which lay the go&s;pel open to objections. The matter to be con&s;idered is, the great ma&s;s of
<PB N="42" REF="028290_0045_0FD8816D5737A250">evidence. And remember the truth of the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity does not depend for its proof, any more than the law of Mo&s;es, upon the etymology of a word, or upon &s;ome detached circum&s;tance. A very little wit &s;harpened by prejudice may cut, and pare, and trim a word to &s;uit any purpo&s;e, and give to detached cir|cum&s;tances any appearance. But here is a great body of prophecy and a va&s;t body of facts, which are &s;uperior to the arts of critici&s;m. They form a long extended range of mountains, which no a&s;&s;ault of man can &s;hake or &s;eparate, and which no length of time can impair.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the prophecies remain, and the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us is known, neither Jew nor Gentile need be at any lo&s;s for grounds of enquiry into the truth or impo&s;ture of the preten&s;ions of the Son of Mary. If Chri&s;tianity be an impo&s;ture, &s;ure|ly it is the mo&s;t extraordinary one that was ever heard of! Is it not &s;trange, that &s;o many prophe|cies &s;hould unite their te&s;timonies in its favour? Is it not &s;ingular, that to get rid of the accumu|lated te&s;timony to the truth of the preten&s;ion of Je&s;us, we mu&s;t put the mo&s;t forced and unnatural con&s;truction upon many of the &s;acred predic|tions? What ought a wi&s;e man, who fears God, to do? Should he re&s;i&s;t &s;uch evidence, becau&s;e &s;ome things turn up in the Me&s;&s;iah's character the rever&s;e of what he has been u&s;ed to think of it? the rever&s;e of what fallible men have taught him to believe? Should he re&s;i&s;t &s;uch evidence, becau&s;e in &s;ome in&s;tances he di&s;covers what he cannot explain, or the propriety of which he can|not &s;ee? Surely not. Go, O man, if thou feare&s;t God, and would&s;t lay hold on his cove|nant, go into thy clo&s;et, and &s;hut thy door upon thee; pray to him who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, and who&s;e cars are open to the prayers of the right|eous; pray that he would pour his &s;pirit upon
<PB N="43" REF="028290_0046_0FD87E2AD673CD80">thee, to teach thee wherefore it is that he con|tendeth with your nation, what the &s;in of I&s;rael is, and where the way of truth; for he hath not forgotten his covenant. He waiteth that he may be gracious.</P>
<P N="10">X. Enquire whether the prophets have not predicted, that the Jewi&s;h people are to reject the Me&s;&s;iah, and for that rea&s;on be &s;cattered over all nations, till they repent? Mo&s;es &s;up|po&s;es the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ome refu&s;ing to hear <HI>that Prophet</HI> which God would rai&s;e up, as you may &s;ee Deut. xviii. 19. There are many prophe|cies which clearly &s;peak of this. I &s;hall men|tion but two or three. The former part of the 32d chap. of I&s;aiah is evidently a prophecy of the Me&s;&s;iah: <Q>Behold a king &s;hall reign in righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> &amp;c. Here the Prophet &s;peaks of the excellence of the Me&s;&s;iah's government, ver. 4. <Q>The heart of the ra&s;h &s;hall under&s;tand knowledge,</Q> &amp;c. But remark his different language, ver. 9th and on, <Q>Ri&s;e up ye carele&s;s women that are at ea&s;e, hear my voice ye care|le&s;s daughters; give ear unto my &s;peech. Many days and years &s;hall ye be trouble.&mdash; Upon the land of my people &s;hall come up thorns and briars.&mdash;The palaces &s;hall be for|&s;aken, the multitude of the city &s;hall be left, the forts and towers &s;hall be for dens forever, a joy of wild a&s;&s;es, a pa&s;ture of flocks.</Q> And how long &s;hall the&s;e days and years of trouble continue? ver. 15. <Q>Until the &s;pirit be poured upon us from on high,</Q> &amp;c. How perfectly does this accord with the Chri&s;tian faith! What a clear delineation of facts &s;ub&s;equent to the re|jection of Je&s;us! Was he the promi&s;ed King, the man who was to be a hiding place from the wind? Did his doctrine tend to make the heart of the ra&s;h under&s;tand knowledge? But the
<PB N="44" REF="028290_0047_0FD8816EABA01358">chief prie&s;ts and elders, with the rulers of the people, procured his death: and &s;ince this for many days and years hath I&s;rael been in trouble; the land of God's people is thorns and briars; the palaces are for&s;aken, and their days and years of trouble will not end till the Spirit be poured upon them from on high, and they repent. Then this <Q>work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace, and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;urance forever.</Q> ver. 17.&mdash;See al&s;o I&s;a. xlii. After the Prophet hath &s;urveyed with rapture the glory and grace of the Re|deemer's character and government, he turns his eyes towards a darker &s;cene. ver. 22. <Q>But this is a people robbed and &s;poiled; they are all of them &s;nared in holes, and are hid in pri|&s;on hou&s;es; they are for a prey, and none deli|vereth; for a &s;poil, and none &s;aith re&s;tore.</Q> ver. 23. <Q>Who among you will give ear to this? Who will hearken and hear for the time to come? ver. 24. Who gave Jacob for a &s;poil, and I&s;rael to the robbers? Did not I the Lord, again&s;t whom they have &s;inned? For they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. ver. 25. There|fore he hath poured upon them the fury of his anger, and the &s;trength of battle, and it hath &s;et him on fire round about, yet he knew it not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</Q></P>
<P>Are you enquiring after truth? Attend then to this remarkable and affecting de&s;cription. If Je&s;us be the Chri&s;t, and your &s;ufferings the con|&s;equence of rejecting him, what elucidation does this prophecy receive? This <HI>Elect</HI> of God hath brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, he hath brought the blind by a way which they know not, he hath taught them the knowledge

Our &s;criptures teach, that God having rai&s;ed up his Son Je&s;us, &s;ent him to ble&s;s you, by turning you from your inquities;&mdash;that had you obeyed his voice, he would have gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; he would have &s;aved you, but ye would not; therefore your hou&s;e was left unto you de&s;olate; &mdash;that for unbelief ye were broken off, though not ca&s;t away; but that when ye &s;hall believe, ye &s;hall be grafted in again, and all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved; as it is written, <Q>There &s;hall come out on Sion a Deliverer, and &s;hall turn away un|godline&s;s from Jacob.</Q></P>
<P>Allowing, for a moment (prejudice a&s;ide) that Je&s;us is the promi&s;ed Saviour, your na|tion treating him as they did, was it not ju&s;t in God (for &s;urely it mu&s;t be a crime the mo&s;t ag|gravated) to cha&s;ti&s;e them for it, til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they repent? And though his cha&s;ti&s;ements extend through more than &s;eventeen hundred years (they con|tinuing &s;till in unbelief) does this at all render void the promi&s;e, if on their repentance his Sa|viour ri&s;e up for their deliverance, and perform for them all the good which the prophets have promi&s;ed?</P>
<P>But in the Me&s;&s;iah you expect a temporal Sa|viour only, and are prejudiced again&s;t Je&s;us, becau&s;e he is held forth principally as &s;piritual
<PB N="58" REF="028290_0061_0FD87E2EF7EBC008">one, and that for all people. But &s;urely the ac|count which the Chri&s;tian Scriptures give us of the character of Chri&s;t, and of the nature of his work and kingdom, is by no means contradic|tory to the ancient prophecies; or at all deroga|tory either to the perfections of God, or the glory of his Anointed. If you &s;earch the pro|phecies, ur bia&s;&s;ed by prejudice and a worldly heart, you may &s;oon learn, that the Saviour who is promi&s;ed, is to be not only a temporal one to you, but al&s;o a &s;piritual one to all people. Hence that fea&s;t of fat things and victory over death, of which I&s;aiah &s;peaks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">9.</NOTE>.

And Ma|lachi &s;ays, <Q>He &s;hall purify the &s;ons of Levi, and purge them as gold and &s;ilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 3.</NOTE>.</Q> Surely the prophets &s;peak of &s;omething more than temporal ble&s;&s;ings! It is a fea&s;t &s;uited to the wants of the &s;oul; it is light which informs the mind, and purification from moral pollution. And is not this a more glo|rious work, <HI>thus</HI> to &s;ave all people, than merely to bring back the &s;cattered tribes of I&s;rael to the land of Canaan, whil&s;t the re&s;t of mankind, to whom their numbers bear no proportion, are le&s;t, without receiving any benefit from him, in darkne&s;s, idolatry, and death? Yes, he is the Saviour of all people, the King of all nations! He brings &s;piritual as well as temporal &s;alvation. His fea&s;t is for all people; and he will de&s;troy the face of the covering, and the veil, that is &s;pread over all nations.</P>

<HEAD>TESTIMONIES IN FAVOUR OF THE CHARACTER, WORKS, AND DOCTRINE OF JESUS.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the te&s;timo|nies which are borne in favour of Je&s;us being the CHRIST. There are te&s;timonies which might be collected from profane authors; but let us con|fine our&s;elves to what the hi&s;torians of Je&s;us and the writers of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles have written. As relators of plain facts, what they affirm is as credible as what any other hi&s;torian may have affirmed; e&s;pecially as they could have no intere&s;t in deceiving, but the contrary; and as, if what they related were not true, they might ea&s;ily have been detected, and thus they would have de&s;troyed the cau&s;e they meant to e&s;tabli&s;h; for the&s;e things were not done or &s;poken in a corner. It is certain then, that mul|titudes of all conditions did entertain a high opinion of the character, works, and doctrine of Je&s;us; and even his enemies have given te&s;ti|mony in his favour.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS day received the an&s;wer to Dr. Prie&s;tley, which you informed me you was about to publi&s;h when I &s;aw you in London; and I take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing a few lines to you, on the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between you. I hope you will excu&s;e the freedom, and be a&s;&s;ured, though I may controvert your po&s;itions, that good-will and the love of truth are the govern|ing principles of my heart; and which, I tru&s;t, will guard me again&s;t &s;aying any thing which might be offen&s;ive to an ingenuous mind, or un|worthy the &s;ubject in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ume not the &s;tile of an an&s;werer; that falls to the &s;hare of tho&s;e who are better qualified: and though, from what I have advanced in my <HI>Friendly Addre&s;s to the Jews,</HI> there may be &s;ome

<P>Surely, Sir, a man is not criminal for endea|vouring to convince his neighbour of what he &s;uppo&s;es to be error; or for offering his hand, though it &s;hould be a weak one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his re&s;earches after truth. His principle will plead for him, &s;hould he need an excu&s;e, &s;o long as he employs no other means than what rea&s;on and religion approve; for though you may not think the law of Mo&s;es (the law of rites) obli|gatory on all mankind; yet you mu&s;t allow, that the Chri&s;tian religion, if it be true, is cer|tainly obligatory on a Jew in the highe&s;t degree. A Chri&s;tian then who &s;eeks to make converts, in the &s;pirit of love, is by no means the object of blame, as you in&s;inuate in your introductory letter.</P>
<P>Your &s;ufferings from Chri&s;tians, you &s;ay (p. 18) is one great argument with you again&s;t Chri&s;tianity's being the peaceable kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, as foretold by the Prophets; but you confe&s;s (p. 19) that the doctrines of Chri&s;|tianity do not teach, or authorize, to &s;hed the blood of Jews (and you might have added of any people) and that you carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the doctrine and its profe&s;&s;ors. Is the doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in it&s;elf peaceful, &s;o that if all men were to live under its influence, would the prophecies in this particular meet with ac|compli&s;hment?
<PB N="69" REF="028290_0072_0FD881A0288667A8">And who can &s;ay, in that ca&s;e, they would not? Here then is a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tive evidence in its favour. Have the prophets any where &s;aid that the doctrine of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom would <HI>in&s;tantaneou&s;ly</HI> produce its great effects, in enlightening the Gentiles, in taming the ferocity, and &s;ubduing the wickedne&s;s of men; &s;o that they &s;hould no longer hurt nor de|&s;troy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xi.</NOTE>? No. The &s;tone which was cut out of the mountain without hands, and which &s;mote the image<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii.</NOTE>, that figured the monarchies of the earth, and brake it in pieces, and afterwards be|came a great mountain, &s;o that it filled the earth, at fir&s;t was &s;mall; time brought it to perfection. The doctrine of Je&s;us hath not yet produced all the effects which the Prophets predicted, and which in its nature it is calculated to produce. Antichri&s;t has retarded its progre&s;s; but it &s;hall prevail. It is prevailing. The reformation, for which you thank God (p. 6) is one event in his un&s;earchable government, which forwards the kingdom of peace; and he mu&s;t &s;hut his eyes who does not &s;ee that increa&s;ing light, which tends to the perfection of that kingdom, which God in his in&s;crutable providence, for the trial of the nations, and for the purpo&s;es of his own glory, hath &s;o long permitted the wickedne&s;s of man to counteract. It is no argument then again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e all the good foretold by the Prophets is not at once produced, if in its own nature it be calculated to produce it; and e&s;pecially if the &s;ame authority which demands our cordial reception of it informs us, that this kingdom of God is as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, and that before the glorious days of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace it promi&s;es, iniquity &s;hall prevail, and the man of &s;in deceive the nations.</P>

As to what you have &s;aid (p. 20, &amp;c.) re|&s;pecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the &s;econd per&s;on in the Trinity, or as a &s;imple Prophet, according to &s;ome, it de&s;erves re-examination. Your idea of per&s;onality in the Trinity is not, I think, the idea of well-informed Trinitarians. There may be people (though I know of none, objectionable as the language of &s;ome may be) who conceive of three per&s;ons in the Godhead as they do of the per&s;ons of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob. But however &s;uch per&s;ons may think in this ca&s;e, look into our &s;criptures (the&s;e are the only te&s;t by which to try Chri&s;tianity;) they certainly teach the unity of God as much as your &s;criptures do.

<P>With this eminence of character which is a&s;|cribed to Je&s;us, who can di&s;pute his right to abrogate the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, or to alter the law of marriage, of which you &s;peak?&mdash;Yea, even &s;uppo&s;ing him a mere man, according to Dr. Prie&s;tley, if he came with &s;ufficient creden|tials, the Jews were obliged to receive him, though he announced him&s;elf commi&s;&s;ioned to abrogate the ceremonial law. Moral laws are of eternal obligation; but po&s;itive in&s;titutions de|pend on the will of the legi&s;lator. God may add to, or take from them, as he plea&s;es. For though the command given by Mo&s;es to the tribes of I&s;|rael, Deut. iv. 2, binds them from altering God's in&s;titutions according to their caprice, yet it by no means conveyed the idea that the Legi&s;lator him&s;elf was bound from adding or dimini&s;hing at his plea&s;ure, and as circum&s;tances &s;hould re|quire. It would have been as &s;inful in an Ante|diluvian to alter the then po&s;itive in&s;titutions of God, as for a Jew in after days; and yet, it could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nter into the heart of any I&s;raelite, when God at Sinai enlarged this law of rites, to &s;uppo&s;e that this formed an argument again&s;t the divine mi&s;|&s;ion of Mo&s;es. It is now, as it always was, &s;inful for any man, at his plea&s;ure, to alter the po&s;itive laws of God; but God him&s;elf is not bound in like manner. And of this abrogation of the Mo|&s;aic in&s;titutions the prophets appear to have predict|ed. See Jer. iii. where the prophecies evidently &s;peaking of the return of I&s;rael from the pre&s;ent di&s;per&s;ion. On their repentance, the promi&s;e is, ver. 14, 15, 16, <Q>I will bring you to Zion:

<P>You &s;ay (p. 29 and 72) that before Chri&s;tians attempt to convert the Jews to Chri&s;tianity, they &s;hould &s;ettle among them&s;elves what honours are due to Je&s;us, and in what the work of &s;alvation con&s;i&s;ts; otherwi&s;e the Jews, among the variety of opinions which prevail, might be deterred therefrom, by rea&s;on of the difficulty attending the making a proper choice of that which is right. But, to the law, and to the te&s;timony. It is not the creed of Athana&s;ius, or Arius, or Calvin, or So|cinus, or Dr. Prie&s;tley, or of any body, which you are called to examine, much le&s;s to &s;ub&s;cribe. Our facred writings are open to you; what do they teach? and how do the doctrines there taught agree with the law and the prophets? Chri&s;tians differ in their explications of the&s;e writings, as do the Jews about theirs: examine them without regard to the opinions of others. What Mr. Lind&s;ey or Mr. Romaine may have &s;aid about Chri&s;tianity, or of what con&s;titutes a Chri&s;tian, is of no more weight with the thinking, than any thing which may have been &s;aid by the mo&s;t ob&s;cure.

<P>As I dare &s;ay the goodne&s;s of your heart will have no objection, I will blot out the 30th page, and pa&s;s on to what you advance re&s;pecting your pre&s;ent captivity.</P>
<P>You endeavour to prove (p. 33 and on) that your pre&s;ent captivity is a continuation of the Babyloni&s;h; and that you now &s;uffer for the &s;ins of your ance&s;tors previous to that period, which, you argue, they at their return never repented of, but in a partial way; that their chief matter of repentance was about the &s;trange women, and not for per&s;ecuting the prophets. This is mak|ing the whole nation, for the &s;ake of a favourite opinion, a body of hypocrites, and holding them forth as deficient in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principle of true repentance&mdash;&s;orrow for all &s;in. This is making God to &s;hew his approbation of a people who were wanting in the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to true goodne&s;s, and who &s;lattered him with hypo|critical words. We cannot admit this idea for a moment, which is &s;o reproachful to I&s;rael, and &s;o unworthy of God. In Nehemiah ix. 26, they confe&s;s the &s;in of their fathers in &s;laying the pro|phets, who te&s;tified again&s;t them; and the great provocation which they wrought, for which they were delivered into the hands of their enemies. See al&s;o their confe&s;&s;ions in the 34th and 35th ver&s;es. And what did they do in te&s;timony of their abhorrence of the deeds of their fathers? <Q>They made a covenant, and &s;ealed it; and
<PB N="77" REF="028290_0080_0FD881B252A85A18">every one having knowledge and under&s;tand|ing, entered into a cur&s;e, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Mo&s;es, the &s;ervant of God, and to ob&s;erve and do all the commandments of the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neh. ix. 38&mdash;x. 28, 29.</NOTE>.</Q> If this be not proof of &s;incere and univer&s;al repentance, then no words are &s;ufficient to tell us what &s;uch repentance is.

My limits will not permit me to &s;tay long on this article: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, there is not that clo&s;e connexion between the prophecy contained in the 8th chap|ter and this in the 9th, as you would per&s;uade us; nor does any thing appear in this chapter which might lead us to think that Daniel was now involved in any perplexity about the two thou|&s;and three hundred days. It is Jeremiah's &s;e|venty years which gives occa&s;ion to his prayer. The prophecy of the two thou&s;and three hundred days, was in the third year of Bel&s;hazzar; this was in the fir&s;t of Darius, a period of twelve or fourteen years di&s;tance.</P>
<P>To &s;ee what fal&s;e principles you go upon, in your application of the events and per&s;ons here &s;poken of, you need only review your 58th page. <Q>Know, therefore, and under&s;tand (that) from the going forth of the commandment to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;alem, unto the anointed Prince (&s;hall be) &s;even weeks. I have already,</Q> &amp;c. You make this an a&s;&s;urance to Daniel, that &s;o far would God be from prolonging the
<PB N="78" REF="028290_0081_0FD881B5D63D7758">&s;eventy years &s;poken of by Jeremiah, that he would &s;horten them to forty-nine, the di&s;tance of time from the de&s;truction of the fir&s;t temple to Cyrus, who was the anointed prince. Read the text again; it is not <Q>from the going forth of the commandment to de&s;troy the fir&s;t temple, unto the anointed Prince, &s;hall be &s;even weeks:" but, "know, therefore, and under|&s;tand, that from the going forth of the com|mandment to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;alem, unto the Me&s;&s;iah the Prince (or the Anointed Prince) &s;hall be &s;even weeks and three&s;core and two weeks.</Q> This needs no comment.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of thus perplexing the prophecy, as your &s;y&s;tem obliges you to do, is it not more natural, and much more agreeable to the tenor of the prophecy, to &s;uppo&s;e that the command|ment here refers to that of Cyrus, recorded in Ez. i. or of Artaxerxes, chap. vii. when they had leave to erect them&s;elves into a body politic; and the &s;even weeks (forty-nine years) as mark|ing out the time which it would take for perfect|ing their city and e&s;tabli&s;hment; &s;ixty-two weeks, (434 years) after which Me&s;&s;iah the Prince (who|ever he be) was to appear, and be cut off? This is certainly the mo&s;t natural way of under&s;tanding the prophecy; for it mu&s;t appear clear to every unbia&s;&s;ed reader, that the Me&s;&s;iah in the 25th ver. and the Me&s;&s;iah in the 26th, who is to be cut off, is the &s;ame per&s;on. And &s;urely if this prophecy be con&s;idered di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, in con|nexion with others which &s;peak of the Saviour who was to come, it mu&s;t evidently appear a clear prediction, both of the time of his appear|ance, and of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In your &s;econd letter (p. 67, and on) you pro|ceed to compare the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t with that of Mo&s;es. After hinting that the miracles

<P>Did Je&s;us by a touch, by a word, by the mere efficiency of his will, heal all manner of di&s;ea&s;es, ca&s;t out devils, and rai&s;e the dead? And do not &s;uch works as the&s;e tran&s;cend all human power? It certainly lies upon you to prove, that he did not perform what is a&s;cribed to him, or to inform us how a human being can do &s;uch things without the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God.</P>
<P>You &s;ay (p. 83) <Q>The miracles of Mo&s;es were not the e&s;pecial proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion.</Q> What pa&s;&s;ed at Sinai, it is true, was a more forci|ble conviction than any of the other miracles, that he was divinely commi&s;&s;ioned, and calcu|lated to make deeper impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of the people; &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as their rude &s;tate required: but it does not hence follow, that the other miracles, which may be &s;aid to be wrought more immediately by Mo&s;es, if they were &s;uch as no man could do unle&s;s God were with him, were not &s;ufficient to prove his divine mi&s;&s;ion. If he had done no more than what he did in Egypt, and at the red &s;ea, the people were bound to receive him as from God; the Lord thus judged when he gave him his mi&s;&s;ion, and endued him with tho&s;e powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ez. iv. 1&mdash;9.</NOTE>: the people thus judged, and followed him. That God gave them more brilliant proofs afterwards was from &s;ove|reign plea&s;ure, and to an&s;wer his wi&s;e purpo&s;es:
<PB N="80" REF="028290_0083_0FD87E33057EB148">but it is never &s;aid or intimated, that tho&s;e other miracles did not prove his mi&s;&s;ion.

<P>As to there not being that nece&s;&s;ity for the mi|racles of Je&s;us as for tho&s;e of Mo&s;es, whether it be &s;o or not, it proves nothing. But &s;uppo&s;e there <HI>were</HI> not that natural nece&s;&s;ity here as in the ca&s;e of dividing the &s;ea, yet was there not a moral nece&s;&s;ity?

True, to feed five thou|&s;and men, be&s;ides women and children, with five loaves and two fi&s;hes; to open the eyes of one born blind, or to rai&s;e a man to life who had been dead three days, is not &s;o tremendous as &s;ome of the miracles in Egypt; they do not make &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions of terror as the thunder and lightning, and voice of trumpets, at Sinai; but do they af|ford le&s;s proof of divine mi&s;&s;ion? No unpreju|diced man can &s;ay they do. Your bu&s;ine&s;s is to prove, that the miracles a&s;cribed to Je&s;us were
<PB N="81" REF="028290_0084_0FD87E1D66B8F6C0">not true and genuine, or all you &s;ay about nece&s;&s;i|ty, or compari&s;on with Mo&s;es, amounts to no|thing. As is the ca&s;e with your ob&s;ervations on Deut. xiii. 1. For before that text can operate again&s;t the mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us, you mu&s;t prove, that what are called his miracles were only the &s;igns and wonders of a juggling impo&s;tor, and that he &s;ays, "Let us go after other gods."</P>
<P>You particularly ju&s;tify your&s;elf in rejecting Je&s;us as the Me&s;&s;iah (p. 67, and on) becau&s;e the credentials which he offers in proof of his mi&s;&s;ion bear no compari&s;on with the e&s;pecial proof of Mo&s;es' mi&s;&s;ion, i. e. with the te&s;timony which was given at Sinai. It is true, here is no thunder and lightning, and God &s;peaking from a fiery mountain (though nature bore awful te&s;timony to the character of Chri&s;t when he died upon the cro&s;s, and proof abounds that he ro&s;e from the dead, and a&s;cended to heaven) but as you argue about nece&s;&s;ity, permit a believer in Je&s;us to do &s;o likewi&s;e. There was not that nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch appearances as tho&s;e at Sinai for the confirmation of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us, as there was for that of Mo&s;es. There (if I may &s;o &s;peak) was laid the foundation of that &s;tupendous &s;uper&s;tructure which God meant to rai&s;e, the redemption of man, the &s;alvation of the world. Thus his wi&s;dom cho&s;e to a&s;certain the beginnings of his work. This foundation laid, and &s;anctified by the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;anctions of heaven, Mo&s;es' mi&s;&s;ion is confirmed; all he wrote or taught is ratified; and that Revela|tion which is from God is identified. In this Re|velation a Saviour is made known, and his work prefigured; God's Anointed is promi&s;ed; and through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of prophecy predic|tions &s;hine brighter and brighter, which give a&s;|&s;urance of his future appearance, and paint in the mo&s;t glowing colours the glory of his per&s;on,
<PB N="82" REF="028290_0085_0FD881BA6C706B48">the dignity of his character, the offices he is to &s;u&s;|tain, and the work he is to perform. Yea, they tell us from what family he is to &s;pring, in what town to be born, with a thou&s;and other circum|&s;tances intended to identify his per&s;on when he came. A me&s;&s;enger, whom all the Jewi&s;h na|tion took for a prophet, announced his approach. He appears, makes known who he is, and to the &s;ublimity of his doctrine he adds miracles in proof of the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion. He heals di&s;ea&s;es, he ca&s;ts out devils, he controls the elements, he ri&s;es the dead, he bids them &s;earch the &s;crip|tures which te&s;tify of him, he claims their faith, and declares, <Q>He that believeth in me &s;hall never die.&mdash;If ye believe not that I am be, ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins.</Q> Though crucified, he ri&s;es from the dead; and in proof of his re&s;ur|rection, and a&s;cen&s;ion to heaven, his di&s;ciples perform miracles in his name, the truth of which the bittere&s;t enemies of Je&s;us could not deny, even though the vice and prejudice of their hearts &s;tirred up their pa&s;&s;ions to re&s;i&s;t conviction. What nece&s;&s;ity for the terrors of Mount Sinai to be repeated here? Mo&s;es and the prophets (the truth of who&s;e words the thunders and light|nings of Sinai have ratified) bore te&s;timony to Je&s;us as the Chri&s;t. And the works which the Father gave him to fini&s;h, he did; which works bear witne&s;s of him that the Father hath &s;ent him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John. v. 36.</NOTE>. All is agreeable to the reque&s;t of I&s;rael in Horch, <Q>Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me &s;ee this great fire any more, that I die not<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xviii. 15&mdash;19.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e remarks might be extended, by taking notice of &s;ome of the le&s;&s;es objections which you &s;tate again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion. Nor would it be difficult to demon&s;trate the folly of that man who rejects Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es
<PB N="83" REF="028290_0086_0FD881BBE86FCA98">he &s;pies out &s;ome little matters, which lay i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. open to objection; but which bear no proportion to the great weight of evidence that preponde|rates in its favour. It might be &s;hewn, that all which you can object to the two miracles which you have picked out of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory (p. 78) makes no more again&s;t the divinity of our &s;cip|tures, than what an infidel (without con&s;idering the manners of the times, without allowing for probable attending circum&s;tances, and by the help of his di&s;torting imagination) might alledge again&s;t the divinity of yours, from &s;ome detached facts culled out of them. Such an one might &s;up|po&s;e it unju&s;t in the I&s;raelites to &s;poil the Egyp|tians<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xii. 35, 36.</NOTE>; he might fancy it "irrational" that&mdash;but let him fancy&mdash; <Q>The ju&s;t &s;hall live by his faith<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hab. ii. 4.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It might be &s;hewn that your objection (p. 88) to the words Je&s;us recorded, John v. 37, origi|nates in a wrong under&s;tanding, not only of this pa&s;&s;age, but of that al&s;o in Exod. xxxiii. 11. Enquiry might be made after the proof, that the Jews in the days of Je&s;us &s;o under&s;tood the &s;even|ty weeks of Daniel, as to know that their city and temple were to be de&s;troyed, when they were, and which you produce (p. 86) for the purpo&s;e of &s;etting a&s;ide the evidence of Je&s;us being en|dued with the gift of prophecy. But this, and much more which might be &s;aid, may be unne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to enter upon, as my de&s;ign in writing this letter was only to drop a few Re|marks, and to thank you for favouring the pub|lic with a &s;tatement of your objections. If you will forgive my thus addre&s;&s;ing you, and attri|bute it to the true motives which influence me, you will confer an obligation on a lover of all good men;</P>
