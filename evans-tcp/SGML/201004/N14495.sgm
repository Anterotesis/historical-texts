<HEAD>A LETTER FROM AN AMERICAN, CONTAINING STRICTURES ON COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ece&s;&s;ion of &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the Briti&s;h Empire, as now con&s;titutes the United States, and the general acknowledgement of their independence by the powers of Europe, mu&s;t point out a very important aera in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es that led to this great revolution, and the operations that in&s;ured it &s;ucce&s;s, will hereafter afford abundant matter for the pen of &s;ome able hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>The immediate effects that it mu&s;t have on the Sy&s;tem of Euro|pean Politics, form a very &s;erious &s;ubject of pre&s;ent enquiry and contemplation; e&s;pecially, as nations begin to be convinced of the futility of becoming great by conque&s;t, and more inclined to abandon the cruel &s;y&s;tem of war, in order effectually to enrich them&s;elves by pur&s;uing the peaceful line of commerce.</P>
<P>The United States, &s;tretching through &s;uch a variety of climates, abounding in &s;uch various productions, and affording &s;uch a va&s;t field for the con&s;umption of European manufactures, mu&s;t natural|ly have a very intimate and active commerce with the different States of Europe.</P>
<P>From adventitious circum&s;tances, peculiarly favorable to Great Britain, no nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es opportunities of &s;o effectually promo|ting this connection; and from her dependence on commerce, for the &s;upport of her power and importance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nation is &s;o pointedly intere&s;ted in the improvement of the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>She has already brought her affairs to the brink of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, from continuing too long a &s;lave to impo&s;ture and delu&s;ion. It is time to recover her from her lethargy; this perhaps may prove a diffi|cult
<PB N="4" REF="018367_0003_0FA6A55F77D95D00">ta&s;k, as ignorant and intere&s;ted writers are &s;till endeavouring to impo&s;e their ill-dige&s;ted and pernicious &s;y&s;tems on the public mind, and to impre&s;s &s;entiments, which, if adopted into the poli|tics of this country, would be entirely &s;ubver&s;ive of a commercial connection betwixt Great Britain and the United States of America.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubmit my opinions on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> your con&s;ideration, and have little doubt of a coincidence of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ment.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember that after the conclu&s;ion of the war, a Bill was introduced into the Hou&s;e of Commons, by Mr. Pitt, (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) in order to &s;erve as a temporary regulation for the trade of the United States. In perfect confor|mity with the &s;pirit of this Bill, it was expected a permanent con|nection betwixt the two Countries, would be formed by treaty; it had in view a &s;y&s;tem of liberal intercour&s;e, and was received in America with univer&s;al approbation, as the harbinger of returning affections.</P>
<P>Under a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that Great Britain would per&s;evere in the line of conduct, that this Bill pre&s;cribed, the United States opened all their ports to Briti&s;h &s;hipping, and received them, without any other re&s;trictions than tho&s;e, which ve&s;&s;els belonging to their own citizens, were expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>A change of mini&s;try &s;oon after took place, and likewi&s;e a change of mea&s;ures; the advocates for the American war compo|&s;ed a part of it; the effects were &s;oon vi&s;ible: a Proclamation, virtually re&s;training all intercour&s;e betwixt the United States and the We&s;t Indies, except in Briti&s;h &s;hipping, made its appear|ance.</P>
<P>This measure was in every re&s;pect impolitic and unwi&s;e, as it was natural to imagine that it would make unfavourable impre&s;&s;i|ons in regard to the views of Great Britain, that would remain long, and affect deeply; and would have a tendency to convince the United States that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of infatuated councils, that &s;evered the two countries a&s;under, &s;till had an a&s;cendency in the Briti&s;h Cabinet, and was likely to continue an in&s;uperable barrier to a free and unre&s;trained connection.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time Lord Sheffield publi&s;hed a pamphlet, which was intended to ju&s;tify the prudent precaution of &s;uch mea|&s;ures, as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the future wealth and power of Great Britain; it is &s;aid to have had a very &s;erious effect on the minds of the people in England, the majority of whom, as in all countries, are more prone to receive the opinions of others, than be at the trouble of furni&s;hing arguments for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>However, it will not be difficult to prove, that his rea&s;oning is extremely flim&s;y and fallacious; entirely remote from the princi|ples of commercial legi&s;lation, and &s;upported on a &s;y&s;tem of ac|knowledged error.</P>
<P>Previous to entering on a refutation of his doctrine, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome few reflections, on the advantages that
<PB N="5" REF="018367_0004_0FA6A562777207E0">the We&s;t India I&s;lands will derive, from being indulged in an in|tercour&s;e with the United States, from which the adoption of Lord Sheffield's &s;y&s;tem would entirely exclude them.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, the climate, and con&s;equently the productions of the United States, are &s;o various, that they can furni&s;h almo&s;t every article that they can furni&s;h almo&s;t every article that the wants and conveniences of the i&s;lands can require; and from circum&s;tances of local &s;ituation, can &s;upply them more abundantly, more expe|ditiou&s;ly on better terms, and le&s;s &s;ubject to contingencies, than they can be procured from Europe; in&s;omuch, that the We&s;t India Planters have always regarded a commercial connection with the United States as e&s;&s;ential to the well-being and improvement of the i&s;lands, and have deprecated the lo&s;s of it, as a mo&s;t fatal bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w to their flouri&s;hing exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The articles which the Coloni&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;tands in need of, are flour, bi&s;cuit, Indian corn, rice, beans, peas, potatoes, &s;alt beef, pork, chee&s;e, butter, beer, cod and other kinds of &s;alt fi&s;h, whale oil, candies, tallow, &s;oap, tobacco, naval &s;tores, hor&s;es, poultry, live cattle, bar iron, building wood of all kinds, frames of hou&s;es, ma&s;ts, &s;pars, hog&s;head &s;laves, heading, &s;hin|gles, plank both pine and oak, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The United States can, not only abundantly, and at all times, &s;upply the&s;e articles, but can furni&s;h them on far more moderate terms, than they can be imported from Europe.</P>
<P>Experience has proved, that no food is &s;o cheap and nouri&s;hing to the &s;laves as Indian corn, of which there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a regular and frequent &s;upply, as it will not keep but a &s;hort time, expo&s;ed to the extreme warmth of the climate. Small ve&s;&s;els are generally employed in furni&s;hing the&s;e &s;upplies, as well as live &s;tock and other articles of provi&s;ions, which could not afford to navigate with cargoes of &s;uch little value if it was not for the quickne&s;s of the voyage, and the certainty of a return freight of We&s;t India produce. The&s;e are not objects of &s;ufficient impor|tance for European ve&s;&s;els; for large quantities would frequently over&s;tock the market, and con&s;equently be expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in the hands of the importer.</P>
<P>But there are particular times when the dependence of the We&s;t Indies on the United States, is more pointedly ob&s;ervable. After a hurricane, that awful and tremendous convul&s;ion of na|ture, that &s;o frequently happens in the tropical climates, that levels with the ground all the buildings and improvements of a plantation, de&s;troys the provi&s;ions, and exhibits throughout the whole country, the wilde&s;t marks of ruin and deva&s;tation: Where is the affrighted planter to look for &s;uccour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance? How is he to repair his lo&s;&s;es, promptly and effectually?</P>
<P>He mu&s;t give him&s;elf up to de&s;pair, if his only reliance is on European &s;upplies: but he feels a con&s;olation when he con&s;iders his vicinity to America, which, though but a fo&s;ter mother, acting like a natural parent, flies to his relief.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018367_0005_0FA6A56336F1FE88">
After the&s;e terrible calamities, which have threatened all the mi&s;eries of famine, he has often found, from experience, that &s;he has poured in &s;uch abundance, as to have reduced the prices of provi&s;ions, much lower than they even were previous to his misfortunes.</P>
<P>The advantages which this commerce pre&s;ents are founded on the broad ba&s;is of reciprocal intere&s;ts, and a mutual exchange of nece&s;&s;ary commodities.</P>
<P>The United States, in return for the &s;upplies they furni&s;h the i&s;lands, will receive their productions, &s;everal of which, &s;uch as rum and mola&s;&s;es, may be called the excre&s;cences of their exports, and without recour&s;e to American con&s;umption, would be in very feeble demand for the European market.</P>
<P>But &s;hould no encouragement be given to the planter, to aid the natural vigour of the &s;oil, by the facility with which he may procure his provi&s;ions; and &s;hould the i&s;lands be deprived of the advantages which their local &s;ituation affords, by having the channel through which their &s;upplies are to be procured, &s;topped up, or confined in too narrow bounds, they will not only individually &s;uffer, by being often expo&s;ed to a calamitous &s;carcity; but the Mother Country mu&s;t finally be &s;en&s;ible of the pernicious effects of &s;uch re&s;trictions. For the body politic, like the human body, has a &s;en&s;e of feeling, in its remote&s;t extremities. Nothing &s;uffers &s;ingly by it&s;elf&mdash;there <Q>is a con&s;ent of the parts in the &s;y&s;tem of both, and the partial evil grows into univer&s;al mi&s;chief</Q> For in an exact ra|tio, with the rate of provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries of life will the demand for labour keep pace, and the price of We&s;t India produce, and its relative quantity, will ri&s;e or fall by the&s;e pro|portions, The planter con&s;equently cannot afford his productions &s;o low, as to be placed in competition with the French at a foreign market, except he procures his nece&s;&s;aries on the be&s;t of terms.</P>
<P>On the contrary, &s;hould the i&s;lands flouri&s;h under a State of ea&s;e and plenty, the Mother Country will be proportionably bene|fited; for it is an invariable rule in commercial polity, that riches always centre in the Metropolis: their diffu&s;ive influence may be compared to the circulation of the blood, which is di&s;per&s;ed over the whole &s;y&s;tem, but always returns back to the heart, the &s;eat of life, and is only &s;ent back by new pul&s;ations.</P>
<P>Should therefore this monopolizing &s;pirit which is a mockery on the indu&s;try of a country, give way to more liberal ideas, the active &s;timulus of the planter will no longer be depre&s;&s;ed. By being furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries on more moderate and ea&s;y terms, he will employ le&s;s of his revenue, to defray the expences of his e&s;tate; he will con&s;equently have a re&s;idue left to appropriate to the the exten&s;ion of his &s;ettlements, clearing and breaking up new grounds, which when brought into culture, will furni&s;h additional quantities of produce, to &s;upply the increa&s;ing demand.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of attaining the&s;e profits to the planter, the State will greatly benefit in an increa&s;e of her revenues, by the duties
<PB N="7" REF="018367_0006_0FA6A566536F8278">laid on the &s;urplus quantity of produce: by the employment of a more exten&s;ive commerce and navigation, which mu&s;t keep pace with the improving condition of her i&s;lands: and by fixing the balance of trade in her favour in proportion to the augmen|tation of her exports.</P>
<P>Another advantage of con&s;picuous character offers it&s;elf; which is their increa&s;ing con&s;umption of manufactures, which improving e&s;tabli&s;hments naturally occa&s;ion; and an increa&s;e of manufac|tures is always accompanied by a proportional increa&s;e of population.</P>
<P>Moulded by habit to a particular mode of thinking in regard to the commercial legi&s;lation of the i&s;lands, I know it will be diffi|cult, and will require every effort of &s;ound rea&s;oning, to break through the &s;y&s;tem of prohibitory laws. e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Briti&s;h Government. But, when an increa&s;e of population and of revenue, progre&s;&s;ive opulence and &s;trength, are to be derived from the effects of abandoning this jealous &s;elf-ob&s;tructing policy; it is to be ex|pected that the &s;pirit of &s;uch contracted e&s;tabli&s;hments will not be inveterate, and on mature con&s;ideration, will no longer be adhered to.</P>
<P>But it is a&s;&s;erted by Lord Sheffield, that regular &s;upplies of provi|&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries may, with proper encouragement, be obtain|ed from the remainder of the Briti&s;h Colonies on the continent.</P>
<P>The&s;e vi&s;ionary &s;ugge&s;tions are almo&s;t too ludicrous to be com|bated, and &s;eem intended as a political artifice, to blind the eyes of the too credulous people, and deceive them into a belief, that their remaining territories in America are of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the inten&s;ene&s;s of the climate of Canada, with the difficulty of its navigation will &s;carcely admit of more than one voyage in the year to the We&s;t Indies, which require a regular and continued &s;upply of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>As for the inho&s;pitable regions of Nava Scotia, it will be matter of wonder, and a &s;olace to humanity, if by the uncea&s;ing indu&s;try of its inhabitants, it will be able to produce a &s;ufficiency, for their &s;u&s;tenance and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The United States mu&s;t therefore continue to be, what they al|ways have been, the granary of the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies; and if direct importations into them are not admitted of, recour&s;e will be had to indirect &s;upplies, through the medium of the neutral i&s;lands. All the additional expence of this circuitous route, in|curred for charges of double in&s;urance, freight, commi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. will fall on the Coloni&s;t, as the com&s;umer, without very materi|ally injuring the American merchant, who will naturally in&s;ure to him&s;elf a &s;aving profit on his exports.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Briti&s;h Government mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h a number of guarda co&s;tas, well armed and appointed, to prevent the clande&s;tine trade that will immediately commence betwixt the United States and their i&s;lands. A trade, that will find a &s;upport and protecti|on, in every planter of the country, who&s;e intere&s;t will be &s;o immediately connected with its encouragement, will not ea&s;ily be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="018367_0007_0FA6A5670AA50190">
Even under the vigorous authority of military government in the French We&s;t Indies, not all the weight of power, exerted for the purpo&s;e, could formerly prevent this &s;pecies of traffic; much le&s;s can it be expected to &s;ucceed, where the reigns of govern|ment are relatively &s;o relaxed, as in the hands of the Briti&s;h Governors.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Great Britain has learned, by fatal dear-bought experi|ence, impre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch &s;trong characters, as not to be &s;oon and ea&s;ily effaced, that <Q>the true art of governing is not to govern too much;</Q> and how difficult it is to rule a people by laws, that it is their intere&s;t to re&s;i&s;t, and render nugatory.</P>
<P>But to counteract the force of the foregoing ob&s;ervations, it is a&s;&s;erted by Lord Sheffield, and what is much more &s;trange, that people are &s;o infatuated as to believe, that notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;olute prohibition on the part of Great Britain, of admi&s;&s;ion of American ve&s;&s;els into her i&s;lands, &s;till that the United States will open their ports to Briti&s;h &s;hipping, and freely indulge them with the liberty of carrying off their produce.</P>
<P>But he mu&s;t have a poor opinion of the force of his own argu|ments, which he has &s;o abundantly furni&s;hed to Great Britain, in favour of this &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem of monopolizing the carrying trade, if he does not believe, that they will operate &s;o effectually on the minds of the Americans, as to induce them, deprived of an equa|lization of privilege, to adopt the &s;ame plan; admitting that their &s;agacious clear-&s;ighted politicians had not already di&s;covered them.</P>
<P>His premi&s;es therefore are not admi&s;&s;ible &mdash; the idea they con|vey is an in&s;ult on common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I expected that in forming an e&s;timate of the American cha|racter, the Engli&s;h had been fully per&s;uaded, from a view of the progre&s;s of their political affairs, that they were conducted by a people who &s;eldom have &s;o widely wandered from their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Habituated to the re&s;i&s;tance of every oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ure, more vigilant over their national concerns, more intent on connecting the &s;cience of politics, with the elements of commerce, as forming the mo&s;t important object of the &s;tate&s;man's attention &mdash; than per|haps any other nation exi&s;ting, is it to be expected, they will ac|quie&s;ce in a &s;y&s;tem, &s;o derogatory to the honour, degrading to the &s;pirit, and injurious to the intere&s;ts of a great people?</P>
<P>A moment's reflection mu&s;t convince every di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enqui|rer, that our legi&s;lators are better guardians of the public con|cerns, than to &s;ubmit to &s;o pernicious an intercour&s;e; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that they are &s;elected from the&s;e, who are the be&s;t ver&s;ed in the intere&s;ts of the States, as relative to tho&s;e of other commercial powers, and who will embrace every advantage that nature has given, or art can procure, to the improvement thereof.</P>
<P>He may continue to cheri&s;h the delu&s;ive idea, but I will tell him in prophetic language, what will be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The States from a &s;en&s;e of common danger, and common intere&s;t, will more clo&s;ely unite together, and form one general
<PB N="9" REF="018367_0008_0FA6A567B847C6A0">&s;y&s;tem of exclu&s;ive navigation, in regard to Great Britain, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on clear, equal and determinate principles of commercial retaliation, which will rapidly pervade the whole Union. Already has a generous competition began to take place, betwixt them, which &s;hall mo&s;t cheerfully adopt, and carry into effect, tho&s;e wi&s;e and &s;alutary mea&s;ures, recommended by the grand council of the country, in order to make their foederal union re&s;pectable, and the United States, as pro&s;perous in Peace, as they have been glorious in War.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that &s;uch public &s;pirited arrangements will, for a time, expo&s;e &s;ome of the States, to temporary inconvenience and di&s;tre&s;s; but after all the &s;acrifices they have already made, will it be &s;urprizing that they &s;hould exert this &s;elf-denying virtue; e&s;pecially as it will eventually become one of the greate&s;t &s;ources of their fu|ture wealth and importance.</P>
<P>Such prohibitions, therefore, on the part of Great Britain, will operate like a charm throughout the country; they will act like a &s;pur on the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, and compel them to turn their attention more immediately to the con&s;truction of &s;hips, and the increa&s;e of their &s;eamen. The ea&s;tern and middle States, which from circum&s;tances of local &s;ituation and character, are more peculiarly calculated for the&s;e purpo&s;es, will, by vigorous exerti|on, by great and increa&s;ing encouragement, in a &s;hort time, be enabled to furni&s;h a &s;ufficient &s;upply. Many of their trading inhabitants will be induced to re&s;ide in, and become citizens of the &s;outhern States, and form e&s;tabli&s;hments therein, in order to devote them&s;elves to the bu&s;ine&s;s of furni&s;hing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;hip|ping, for the tran&s;portation of their bulky produce.</P>
<P>Such circum&s;tances, fortunately combining in favour of the gene|ral intere&s;t of the republic will operate as a bond of union among&s;t them by occa&s;ioning their re&s;pective citizens to continue to mix freely and intimately together.</P>
<P>And by making them mutually dependent on each other for reci|procal &s;ervices, will dive&s;t them of local attachments, and will irre&s;i&s;tibly impel them to become friends, to the rights and intere&s;ts of confederated America. For as the propagation of mankind depends on the intercour&s;e of per&s;ons of different &s;exes, &s;o do political connections thrive only betwixt &s;uch countries, as furni&s;h different materials for their mutual exchange, and who &s;oon become, from a &s;en&s;e of each others wants mutually endeared to each other. Yet this &s;hrewd p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">litcian infers, that the States will oppo&s;e each other, becau&s;e their &s;taples and their climate are different&mdash;forgetting the truth of that political maxim, that inte|re&s;t unites, from the &s;ame cau&s;e that it divides.</P>
<P>Therefore this &s;elfi&s;h arrangement which appears to predominate, in the Briti&s;h Cabinet, and which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an emanation from the &s;ame ill fated &s;tar, which in your political &s;y&s;tem has been &s;o long looked up to as your polar direction, will eventually become
<PB N="10" REF="018367_0009_0FA6A56879C15EB0">a great advantage to the United States; for I am well convinced, that they never will arrive to any eminence as a naval power, until their inhabitants are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of being the exclu|&s;ive carriers of their own productions, thereby encouraging mer|cantile navigation, &s;o as to make it become a nur&s;ery of &s;eaman. I &s;ay forced, for the a&s;&s;ertion of Lord Sheffield, that our ve&s;&s;els na|vigate cheaper than tho&s;e of Great Britain, is not founded on fact; for when their &s;peedy decay, comparatively with tho&s;e of the Bri|ti&s;h, with the &s;carcity of &s;eamen, the much higher price of wa|ges, and the nece&s;&s;ity of importing mo&s;t of the building materials from Europe, are taken into con&s;ideration, it will clearly be in|ferred, that the latter can afford their freights, at a much ea&s;ier rate.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the United States be compelled to adopt a navigati|on act, the pro&s;pect will then change, the demands for &s;eamen will greatly increa&s;e, their wages will be encouraging, and it will not be po&s;&s;ible to prevent their pa&s;&s;ing into the American &s;ervice; for this cla&s;s of people, as wavering and incon&s;tant as the element that wafts them, are attached to change of climate, and are ea&s;ily allured by the pro&s;pect of greater wages, or kinder treatment.</P>
<P>Under the influence of the above cau&s;es it mu&s;t be clearly evident, that the fears of our competition in the carrying trade of the We&s;t Indies, are entirely groundle&s;s. Be&s;ides, it is not probable that the Americans will &s;eek in foreign countries for freights, when they have not perhaps above one fourth part of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;hipping to &s;upply their own demands, for tran&s;porting their produce to market: How ab&s;urd and contradictory then are Lord Sheffield's apprehen&s;ions! for it is, from a pre&s;umption of their &s;carcity of &s;hippiing, that he affirms that the Americans will not refu&s;e their produce to the offers of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els: he ack|nowledges likewi&s;e, that the French under&s;ell the Briti&s;h &s;ugars at foreign markets; there can con&s;equently be but little danger of the Americans being de&s;irous of carrying them to foreign ports; for where will be the inducement?</P>
<P>In arguing again&s;t this &s;elfi&s;h contracted &s;y&s;tem, founded on extreme cupidity, and in favour of a free unre&s;trained commerce betwixt the two countries, I have no view of con&s;ulting the ad|vantages of the United States to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e of Great Britain.</P>
<P>I know it would be folly to expect that &s;he would make &s;acrifices of her intere&s;ts, to accommodate the views of the Americans.</P>
<P>But it &s;o happens, that &s;he cannot favour the United States with an indulgence, for which they are not able to furni&s;h more than a reciprocal benefit.</P>
<P>It is expedient however to examine &s;till more fully, what the grand leading argument that Lord Sheffield adduces in favour of the nece&s;&s;ity of totally excluding them from a participation in the Briti&s;h We&s;t India trade, amounts to. He is fearful that they will thereby become the carriers of the produce of the i&s;lands to
<PB N="11" REF="018367_0010_0FA6A5693754B028">the place of its con&s;umption, which will create an interference of foreign ve&s;&s;els, thereby le&s;&s;ening the number of &s;eamen, and con|&s;equently the naval force of the country.</P>
<P>But, if in addition to all that I have already &s;aid, I an&s;wer, that in return for this accommodation which he may call indul|gent, but which I have clearly evinced to be the intere&s;t of Great Britain, con&s;ulting the welfare of her i&s;lands, to grant.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if in return for this accommodation, her &s;ubjects may be admitted to a free ingre&s;s and egre&s;s to and from the ports of the United States&mdash;What reply will the advocates for this &s;y&s;tem make? &mdash; What will become of Lord Sheffield' rea&s;oning, when weighed in the &s;cale of comparative proportion? I only wi&s;h them to comprehend the magnitude of the advantage. Men of weak or limited under|&s;tandings, will be incapable of extending their ideas, &s;o as to em|brace the va&s;t field it opens to an enlightened mind.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, they will not a&s;&s;uredly deny, that the produc|tions of the United States, to the tran&s;portation of which, from the propo&s;ed arrangement, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be admitted, will furni&s;h twice the quantity of bulky materials, that the exports of the We&s;t Indies do, and will con&s;equently employ twice the quan|tity of &s;hipping. &mdash; To &s;tamp conviction in regard to the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, let them take a view of the rice, indigo, and lumber of Georgia and South Carolina; &mdash; the naval &s;tores, lumber, and tobacco of North Carolina; &mdash; the tobacco wheat, Indian corn, &amp;c. of Virginia and Maryland; &mdash; the flour, lumber corn, and various provi&s;ions of Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Jer&s;ey and New-York; &mdash; the fi&s;h, lumber, live &s;tock, &amp;c. of the New England States.</P>
<P>Admit the fact to be a&s;certained with &s;atisfactory preci&s;ion, will it not be confe&s;&s;ed, that an arrangement, by which both countries are freely admitted to a participation of each other's trade, will be highly advantageous to Great Britain.</P>
<P>This is a po&s;ition, as clear as any mathematical axiom.&mdash;Be&s;ides, the advantages of Great Britain may be deemed increa&s;|ing, as the exportation of the bulky produce of the United States, in which her ve&s;&s;els will be employed, will augment, in proportion to the population of the country;&mdash; a population, that will pro|bably be productive beyond all examples of former ages, &mdash; multiplying like the &s;eeds of the harve&s;t.</P>
<P>Whereas, on her part, there is but little room for exten&s;ion of improvement; &mdash; on this point her mo&s;t &s;anguine friends would compound, for her being fixed and &s;tationary.</P>
<P>But Lord Sheffield argues, that it would be folly to grant the Americans any particular privileges and conce&s;&s;ions, as the treaties with France, and the United Provinces, in direct terms forbid the Briti&s;h being put on a better footing than the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>The faculties of this writer mu&s;t be &s;trangely perverted, &mdash; or
<PB N="12" REF="018367_0011_0FA6A569F85B3F00">his de&s;ign mu&s;t evidently be to delude the public mind, by giving &s;o fal&s;e a con&s;truction to this part of the treaties.</P>
<P>Can it be imagined, on the principles of common &s;en&s;e, that if the French and Dutch exclude the Americans from a &s;hare of their We&s;t India trade, the United States will grant to the inhabitants of tho&s;e countries, the &s;ame free admi&s;&s;ion into their ports, as to tho&s;e of Great Britain, who may permit an unre&s;trained participation in their commerce? In every contract, there is a <HI>quid pro quo</HI> &mdash; openly expre&s;&s;ed, or tacitly implied; &mdash; and it is not to be pre&s;um|ed, that the mo&s;t favoured nation can require a benefit, without granting a reciprocal return; &mdash; it is contrary to the avowed policy of nations, which, it is well under&s;tood, is founded on the broad ba&s;is, of intere&s;t and convenience.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;ons will tend to fru&s;trate the hopes of Ru&s;&s;ia, who cannot, like the United States, give an equitable equivalent to Great Britain, in return for &s;uch great conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>France has hitherto, invariably, by her own internal re&s;ources, &s;upplied her i&s;lands abundantly, with many of the nece&s;&s;aries they &s;tand in need of, and is &s;till in a capacity to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to other articles, (the produce of the United States,) that do not interfere with her own exports, &s;he has given free admi&s;&s;ion to them all into her We&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; &mdash; and in order to gain the advantages of the rum trade, which the Briti&s;h hitherto have exclu&s;ively propo&s;ed, &s;he has ceded particu|lar di&s;tricts in her i&s;lands, for the accommodation of the Ameri|cans, who may chu&s;e to erect di&s;tilleries thereon, which, for their great encouragement, are to be exempt from taxes, for a certain number of years. &mdash; The con&s;ummate policy of her councils was never more eminently di&s;played, than in this mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>See Proclamation of the General of Martinico, publi&s;hed in the Public Adverti&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed planter, in viewing the re&s;pective arrangements of the two countries, will wonder where the genius of Britain, &s;o famed for her commercial knowledge, has retired.</P>
<P>After having already made it appear that it is the intere&s;t of Great Britain (independent of all other con&s;iderations) to adopt the plan of an open communication between the i&s;lands and the United States, and that it is in the power of the latter to grant more than they receive; &mdash; I will now have recour&s;e to an argument, that perhaps will have a &s;alutary effect on tho&s;e, who are the mo&s;t difficult to be per&s;uaded; &mdash; I mean, the relative &s;ituation of the two countries, which makes it the intere&s;t of Great Britain, more than that of any other European power, to be pointedly connected with the American States.</P>
<P>Let a moment's attention be paid to this &s;ubject, and let the in|ference be fairly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately drawn.</P>
<P>Great Britain, by the &s;uperior &s;kill and indu&s;try of her inhabi|tants
<PB N="13" REF="018367_0012_0FA6A56AB72700D8">and &s;ome adventitious circum&s;tances, has carried many of her manufactures to a degree of perfection and cheapne&s;s, which no other country in Europe has arrived at.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the inferior &s;tate of her population, compared with &s;ome of her rival nations, and the very limited extent of her terri|tory, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a con&s;iderable part of her revenues, to &s;upport the immen&s;e load of debt &s;he has incured, mu&s;t be drawn from this &s;ource &mdash; from the indu&s;try of her people.</P>
<P>The United State at pre&s;ent offer three millions of inhabitants. rapidly increa&s;ing to numbers, all of whom con&s;ume more or le&s;s of Briti&s;h manufactures, &mdash; the productions of art and indu&s;try, &mdash; in return for which, they give the raw materials &mdash; the produce of agriculture, in their native &s;tate.</P>
<P>How &s;ufatueted mu&s;t the councils of your country be, which could rend but for a moment, to di&s;turb &s;o beneficial an inter|cour&s;e; or &s;u&s;pend the &s;weets of &s;o lucrative a commerce!</P>
<P>The United States have as yet laid no impo&s;itions on the im|portation of Briti&s;h manufactures, that can have any tendency to re|&s;train the con&s;umption of them;&mdash;and many rea&s;ons of con&s;picuous weight and importance continually offer, in favour of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch duties; &mdash; for by operating as a &s;umptuary law, &s;uch a mea&s;ure would be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to a young country by repre&s;&s;ing the de&s;ire of foreign luxuries, which have already been poured into America, in &s;uch abundance, that the States begin to &s;uffer, from not having &s;ufficient produce to remit in payment; &mdash; which turns the balance of trade greatly again&s;t them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mdash; Be&s;ides, &s;uch re&s;trictions wi&s;ely impo&s;ed, tend to &s;timulate and encourage a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among&s;t the people, to aim at &s;imilar improvements. &mdash; <HI>December</HI> 16th. 1783.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the impolitic conduct of Great Britain precipitate the adoption of this mea&s;ure by the re&s;pective States, where are her growing re&s;ources to counteract the effects of this failure of internal indu&s;try? &mdash; for it is univer&s;ally agreed, that no coun|try is more dependent on foreign demand, for the &s;uperfluous produce of art and indu&s;try; &mdash; and that the luxury and ex|travagance of her inhabitants, have already advanced to the ul|timate point of abu&s;e, and cannot be &s;o increa&s;ed, as to augment the home con&s;umption, in proportion to the decrea&s;e that will take place on a diminution of foreign trade.</P>
<P>What then will become of all tho&s;e u&s;eful hands, that were employed in &s;upplying the great demand?</P>
<P>Recollect the cries of &s;uffering thou&s;ands, at the time of the non-importation agreement;&mdash; the&s;e people, in their own de|fence, will emigrate to America.</P>
<P>Such a &s;y&s;tem of conduct per&s;evered in, will operate in favour of the United States, as effectually, as the revocation of the edict of Nantes did in behalf of the prote&s;tant countries of Europe &mdash; by holding up America, as the mo&s;t de&s;irable refuge for the pro|perty, arts, and manufactures of Great Britain to retire to; &mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="018367_0013_0FA6A56B790BF548">a country, where civil and religious liberty are upheld in all their purity,&mdash; where, by the exertion of a few years of none&s;t indu&s;|try, an emigrant is morally &s;ure, of being furni&s;hed with the means of becoming an independent freeholder; &mdash; a country, that has laid no impolitic re&s;traints on naturalization;&mdash; who&s;e yoke is ea&s;y, and who&s;e burthen's light; and which indulgently holds out its arms for the reception of the weary and heavy laden of all nations; and which, notwith&s;tanding the attempts of Great Bri|tain to en&s;lave it, would generou&s;ly offer an a&s;ylum for her per&s;e|cuted &s;ons, who impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of gratitude, <Q>may blu&s;h to think their fathers were its foes.</Q></P>
<P>But Lord Sheffield exultingly advances, that the Americans cannot forego the Briti&s;h manufactures; &mdash; and that &s;o far from the nece&s;&s;ity of courting their cu&s;tom, not all the interdicts of Congre&s;s, and of the &s;everal States, during the war, could prevent their con&s;umption.</P>
<P>To deduce important inferences, from &s;uch faulty premi&s;es, would be "leaning on a broken reed," There may be at pre|&s;ent &s;ome partiality in the States, for Briti&s;h manufactures;&mdash; yet this predilection ari&s;es from cradle prejudices, and has greatly decrea&s;ed during the war;&mdash; and it would be unwi&s;e in Great Britain to place any reliance on a continuation of it: &mdash; for the manufactures of other countries, if equally good, and afforded cheaper, will, by a continued competition, be eventually prefer|red: e&s;pecially, as there will be a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of emigrants from different parts of Europe, who have no decided preference in favour of the fa&s;hion or quality of Briti&s;h manufactures, and who, by mixing with the ma&s;s of the people, will gradually effect a change in their ta&s;te.&mdash;Already do the Americans begin to complain, that the Briti&s;h manufactures are &s;lighted, and infe|rior in quality to their u&s;ual &s;tandard; &mdash; and it is well known, that many of the coar&s;e kinds of &s;tuffs, made at Norwich, Coven|try, Spitalfields, and other factories, are &s;hamefully deficient in length, whil&s;t the Dutch, Flemi&s;h, and French, u&s;ually give a generous &s;urplus in their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But if the a&s;&s;ertions of Lord Sheffield were founded on truth, what &s;hould be the conduct of Great Britain?</P>
<P>Surely no circum&s;tance can be more favourable to the aggrandi|zing a nation of indu&s;try, than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a foreign trade with a country, which does not &s;upply its own wants, and in which, the con&s;umers of manufactures, that &s;he furni&s;hes, are continually increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>Surrounded by rival nations, who&s;e intere&s;ts are oppo&s;ed to hers, does &s;he con&s;ider the duties that ari&s;e out of &s;uch a connection? They &s;hould prompt her to facilitate, by every method in her power the means of making remittances, in return for the manu|factures &s;he furni&s;hed; not by prohibiting the &s;ale of American ve&s;&s;els which are &s;ent to England for the payment of Briti&s;h debts; &mdash; by opening her ports for the importation of American produce
<PB N="15" REF="018367_0014_0FA6A56C36B5E3D0">free of duty; &mdash; not by laying &s;uch heavy impo&s;itions thereon, as to oblige the merchant to &s;eek a more friendly market? and by culti|vating an intercour&s;e, pointedly intimate, with that country; &mdash; for this is the vernal &s;ea&s;on, when the &s;eeds of future connection and intimacy with America are to be &s;own and cultivated;&mdash;not by &s;howing evident marks of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction at every fabri|cated account of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of America.</P>
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to follow Lord Sheffield through the tedious detail of articles that he has enumerated, as con&s;tituting the wants of the Americans, the greate&s;t part of which, he a&s;&s;erts, they mu&s;t ab&s;olutely procure from England; &mdash; the fallacy of this account can only be di&s;covered by a per&s;on who is acquainted with the nature of the American trade, and the relative quality and price of foreign manufactures.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e a&s;&s;ertion to a&s;&s;ertion, would not be &s;ufficient to operate conviction on the public mind; &mdash; but &s;urely, one who can &s;eriou&s;ly place the articles of &s;ilk, laces, and &s;alt, among&s;t the number of the&s;e which Great Britain can enter into competition with other countries in &s;upplying America with, mu&s;t either be very ignorant of his &s;ubject, or extremely partial to his own country.</P>
<P>On a fair and candid con&s;ideration of the foregoing reflections, I think you will be per&s;uaded, that the beautiful pro&s;pect that Lord Sheffield has painted to the eyes of his enraptured countrymen, of the increa&s;ing con&s;equence of Great Britain, from his plea&s;ing Arcadian plans will without great care taken to prevent it, and by pur&s;uing a &s;y&s;tem diametrically oppo&s;ite to what he has formed, di&s;appear, like the dancing vi&s;ion of a mi&s;ty evening.</P>
<P>He rea&s;ons, as if the trade of America mu&s;t irre&s;i&s;tbly be con|fined to its former channel; whereas I can a&s;&s;ure him, that freed from the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roul of your Navigation Act, and all the fetters of commercial re&s;traint it will expand it&s;elf, as far as &s;eas can carry, or winds can waft it.</P>
<P>He forgets the energy of this young Country, that he is devot|ing to &s;uch humiliation re&s;trictions; &mdash; he forgets, that it exhibited, whil&s;t in it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cradle, &s;uch marks of firmne&s;s and vigour of con&s;titution, as like young Hercules to cru&s;h the &s;erpent, that wantonly attacked it.</P>
<P>He does not recollect, that it is in the power of the United States, if provoked to it, to have recour&s;e to recrimination and mutually ill offices, and to e&s;tabli&s;h re&s;trictions &s;imilar to tho&s;e Great Britain may impo&s;e, which will be relatively far more prejudicial to her trade and commerce.</P>
<P>An impartial di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Engli&s;hman, fully weighing the rea&s;ons alled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed again&s;t the adoption of Lord Sheffield's re&s;training &s;y&s;tem, and cordially attached to the intere&s;t of Great Britain, will depre|cate the fatal mea&s;ure.</P>

<P>THE Author feels him&s;elf con&s;trained to beg his readers in|dulgence, for the ha&s;ty manner, which the &s;cantine&s;s of his time (not being able to devote but three evenings to it) has obliged him to ob&s;erve in preparing the following addre&s;s.

<P>It has been his &s;tudy to &s;tate the thoughts which occurred in &s;o &s;hort a time, in as plain and &s;imple a manner as he could, and not to puzzle his hone&s;t reader with learned form, or to plague him with frequent quotations from the works of the dead, to &s;hew his own great reading.

<HEAD>MENTOR's REPLY TO PHOCION's LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>RAISE a feather in the air, and it will be impo&s;&s;ible to de|termine where it &s;hall light &s;o it is with a newly rai&s;ed political &s;entiment only gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing that there are a few intere&s;ted, both for and again&s;t it, to give it a circulation.</P>
<P>When the letter of Phocion, fir&s;t made its appearance the doc|trines contained in it &s;tood &s;o oppo&s;ed to common under&s;tanding, that I was very far from &s;uppo&s;ing that any con&s;equences ari&s;ing from them, would make a reply to the letter in the &s;malle&s;t degree ne|ce&s;&s;ary; &s;o far from it, I judged a reply would carry with it, the appearance of wantonly &s;eizing an occa&s;ion to introduce the author upon the &s;tage of politics; but experience has taught me that pa&s;&s;ion, pomp, and plau&s;ibility, may pa&s;s even upon an en|lightened people, for argument and truth.</P>
<P>This author, while he declaims again&s;t "heated &s;pirits." and "inflammatory" publications, gives us a &s;triking proof that he has, in an eminent degree, that great di&s;qualification for a &s;tate&s;man an uncontroulable warmth of temper. This letter affords us an in&s;tance of the frailty of human nature. It gives us the picture of a &s;trong and tolerably well informed mind, which, perhaps having been flattered by &s;ucce&s;s in the early &s;tage of life, has acquired too much re&s;pect for its own capacity, too much contempt for that of others, and too much vanity to conceal the&s;e effects.</P>
<P>A &s;tate&s;man &s;hould be well informed of the nature of that kind of evidence, which given political opinion; he would then &s;ee the po&s;&s;ibility of others having materials to rea&s;on from, which the ha&s;tine&s;s of his mind may have overlooked. This would teach him the u&s;e of holding in decent re&s;pect the opinion of others, and of his being a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquirer into the means which produced them, I can &s;uppo&s;e that Phocion believed him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an hone&s;t warmth; but want of charity and want of mode&s;ty, in one who offers him&s;elf for public in&s;pection, will never fail to rai&s;e &s;ome bile again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But my bu&s;ine&s;s is with the political part of Phocion's Letter, not that which paints the author, and I would apologize for &s;aying this much, if I was not &s;o &s;trongly courted to it by his illiberality. For in writing and acting, I would wi&s;h forever to &s;eparate the &s;tate&s;|man or politician, and the man.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="018367_0017_0FA6A56FE7510C58">
The little regard which Phocion had to method in the arrange|ment of his arguments, mu&s;t be my excu&s;e for adopting the &s;ame plan. I mu&s;t take him where the weight of his arguments &s;eem to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then to his con&s;truction of the treaty? (which as his pam|phlets are in the hands of mo&s;t of the people, I will not trou|ble them with a long extract of it here) I beg leave to oppo&s;e to it the con&s;truction in one of the publications, under the &s;ignature of Gu&s;tavus, and leave the public to judge which is faire&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>In the 6th article of the treaty it is provided, that no one &s;hall &s;uffer in his per&s;on, liberty, or property, on account of the part he may have taken in the war. The 5th article de|&s;cribes the per&s;ons provided for, and di&s;tingui&s;hes them into three cla&s;&s;es: Fir&s;t, tho&s;e that are real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. The &s;econd, tho&s;e that were within their lines, and had not taken arms again&s;t the country. The third cla&s;s are de&s;cribed by the provi&s;ion that is made for them, viz. They &s;hall have liberty to go into any part of the United States, for twelve months, to &s;olicit a re&s;toration of their e&s;tates that may have been confi&s;cated. This cla&s;s mu&s;t be tho&s;e, who, belonging to America, have taken arms again&s;t their country. The fir&s;t and &s;econd cla&s;s, it is agreed, that Congre&s;s &s;hall <HI>recommend</HI> to the &s;tates, a re&s;toration of their property. The third it &s;eems were too infamous for the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to a&s;k any con&s;ideration for, except the wretched privilege of a&s;king it for them&s;elves. But I can find no where, even a reque&s;t, and that only implied, that any of the three cla&s;&s;es may dwell among us, and enjoy the im|munities and privileges of citizens; for the fir&s;t cla&s;s are con&s;i|dered as former &s;ubjects, the &s;econd and third as acquired &s;ubjects of England.</Q></P>
<P>But Phocion &s;tarts another difficulty: He &s;ays, to imagine, that by e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Great Britain, they become aliens, is to admit, that &s;ubjects may, at plea&s;ure, renounce their allegiance to the &s;tate of which they were members, and devote them&s;elves to a foreign juri&s;diction; a principle, he adds, contrary to law, and &s;ubver&s;ive of government."</P>
<P>To this I reply, that it there was nothing more in the ca&s;e than their adhering to the then enemies of our country, I would readily join Phocion in opinion, that this action &s;imply, &s;hould not be con&s;trued to amount to alienation; but it &s;hould be con&s;trued to amount to trea&s;on. So, in&s;tead of aliens, I would render them traitors, and as &s;uch, put the penal laws in force again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But it is by treaty, that they become aliens or &s;ubjects of En|gland. By the treaty England adopted them as &s;ubjects, and by ratifying that treaty, the &s;tates, and this &s;tate, from the &s;hare &s;he had in it, con&s;ented to that adoption. And this is the great benefit of the treaty to them, which Phocion &s;ays, we would vio|late; whereas it appears that we, who he dubs heated and de&s;igning men, are the real &s;upporters of it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="018367_0018_0FA6A56FF9246EE8">
Graining them to be aliens, Phocion continues, they cannot hold real property under our government, their real e&s;tates then mu&s;t be con&s;idered as belonging to the public, this is confi&s;cati|on, and thereby the treaty is violated. I an&s;wer, that they are aliens, but aliens &s;tipulated for. If in doing this, our mini&s;ters have exceeded the powers given them, and Congre&s;s al&s;o, by acceding to what they have done; or, if they agreed to an article in the treaty, which wars with the nature of government or with the particular genius of ours, let it be &s;o declared, and al&s;o the con&s;equence of the blunder; then we may take up the &s;ubject in another point of view. But till then we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as it is, and take it for granted that it is right.</P>
<P>But for my own part, I cannot &s;ee the incon&s;i&s;tency of it. Sup|po&s;e the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t India company had claims to certain lands in America, before her &s;eparation from England, and by an article of the treaty it &s;hould be agreed, that they &s;hould have the privi|lege of &s;elling it, &s;ome might doubt the ju&s;tice of it, but I think none could doubt the right.</P>
<P>To make it appear, that in removing a number of the&s;e peo|ple, pro&s;ecutions of &s;ome kind or other would be nece&s;&s;ary, and which are forbid by the treaty, &s;eems to be a chief de&s;ign of Pho|cion. Be&s;ide others which have been ob&s;erved, he &s;tarts this: How will it be determined, but by pro&s;ecution, who have &s;o ad|hered to the enemy, as in a legal &s;en&s;e to amount to a crime? I an&s;wer, in the fir&s;t place, that no que&s;tion of law ari&s;es on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is by treaty, and not by law, that we are to judge of them; for the ratification of that has, in effect, repealed all the laws that &s;tood in force again&s;t them. If the treaty have not this power, then have we played the cheat, not only with England, but with every power that was repre&s;ented in that Congre&s;s, which &s;ettled the terms of pence. In the &s;econd place, that the treaty it&s;elf makes the di&s;tinction that otherwi&s;e would be wanting; and all that is nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature in this particular is, by an act of grace to make a di&s;tinction of a very different kind; to di&s;tin|gui&s;h and re&s;tore to citizen&s;hip, the de&s;erving of tho&s;e who are by treaty made &s;ubjects of England.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume it mu&s;t by this time clearly appear, that the people we are &s;peaking of are the &s;ubjects of England. It then remains to &s;ee, what nece&s;&s;ity demands, and what ju&s;tice and honour will allow to be done with them; and in this inve&s;tigation, let us throw a&s;ide every pa&s;&s;ion, but that which is concerned for the &s;afety and true intere&s;t of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Before I proceed, permit me to lay it down as a maxim, that it is a principle coincident with the very nature of &s;ociety, that there be a power ve&s;ted in it, in &s;ome form or other, adequate to the purpo&s;e, not only of correcting any pre&s;ent evil in it, but to prevent a probable future one.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="018367_0019_0FA6A570D7AE8000">
Though I abhor all rea&s;onings which tend to make le&s;s hei|nous the dreadful &s;in of taking arms again&s;t our country, both as it regards the eternal law of ju&s;tice, and al&s;o good policy; yet as the country has agreed by a &s;olemn compact, not to take venge|ance of tho&s;e of this character in America, both our honour and intere&s;t are concerned to pre&s;erve this compact inviolate, &s;o upon this occa&s;ion I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s all that pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from a lively recollection of what this country has &s;u&s;tained from them, would dictate, and &s;peak of them only as they re&s;pect our political &s;afety, as a morbid humour in our political body, which requires healthy remedies to expel.</P>
<P>After a former has prepared his ground, would he mix cockle with his &s;eed-wheat to grow up with, and contaminate the whole|&s;ome grain? In e&s;tabli&s;hing a young empire, &s;hould we leave the principle of &s;edition in its foundation? But Phocion will tell us that this is a bug-bear danger. <HI>Make it their intere&s;t and they will be good &s;ubjects.</HI> God forbid, the government &s;hould make it their intere&s;t to be its friends; for to do this, would be to bring the principles of the government to &s;uit <HI>them,</HI> not them to &s;uit <HI>it,</HI> The tory principle, where it has been long entertained, and where it has long beat uni&s;on with the pa&s;&s;ions, is more fixed and immo|veable than the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed government. I &s;peak of tho&s;e who have been much concerned in government &s;peculation. Of poli|tical opinions, tho&s;e which re&s;pect monarchical and republican go|vernments, are mo&s;t oppo&s;ed of cour&s;e mo&s;t irreconcileable; they beget a contempt for each other, in the members of the two go|vernments.</P>
<P>To &s;how that our fears for the well-being of our government on this occa&s;ion, are founded in rea&s;on, and not ideal, be&s;ide what has been already &s;aid, let us con&s;ider the number and quality of the people, who, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, are the &s;ubjects of di&s;pute, and the difference between the government which their principles contend for, and ours.</P>
<P>In a monarchical government, I grant the doctrine of Phocion may obtain. There fear might make it their intere&s;t to be good &s;ubjects; the fear of offending again&s;t the government. But, in a republican government, the people are their own governors. A republican government mu&s;t take its &s;hape from the opinion of the people, and is variable, as the opinions of its component parts may vary; hence the nece&s;&s;ity of correcting that evil, which may &s;pring from a corruption of opinion, and though it may be con|fined to a few at fir&s;t, it may communicate to the overturning of the government. The number of tho&s;e who are in reality mal|contents in America, are not &s;o &s;mall as may be imagined; nor are their views and hopes &s;o humble as many &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that government has a right to anticipate probable evils. The tory principle cortains in it a mortal and irreconci|leable hatred to our government. That this principle will be communicated, is too probable, when we con&s;ider the wealth,
<PB N="21" REF="018367_0020_0FA6A57177526E08">the art, the per&s;everance and fa&s;hion of many of its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors.</P>
<P>On the other hand, let us con&s;ider the indigence which the ra|vages of a long and accur&s;ed war have created in the other party, which mu&s;t cau&s;e them a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to attend torneir own orivate con|cerns. For though &s;ome of them &s;till pre&s;erve a lively attention to the government, yet in many the effect which I have mention|ed, has been wrought; and in a little time the la&s;t &s;pa&s;ms of he republican &s;pirit will be over, the meager gho&s;t of poverty with all her train of evils, being con&s;tantly before them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">very to her con&s;ideration will yield to the &s;pur of nece&s;&s;ity. In the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n while, the mal-contents are left with the means, and can afford the lei&s;ure to get into admini&s;tration. Tais, fellow citizens is the condition of affairs; &mdash; I blu&s;h to proclaim it, to which the writings and &s;ayings of whigs tend to bring you! &mdash; For Phocion tells you, that he has been an eminent &s;ervant of the republic in e&s;tabli&s;hing her independency. If a revolution is effected in the manner above &s;tated, however infamous the means, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nen the revolution is compleated, it is a ju&s;t one, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed that a majority of opinions are for it. Therefore I &s;ay, it is importantly the duty of the pre&s;ent government to anticipate &s;uch an evil, by removing the cau&s;es of pravity of opinion. But &s;hort of a revolution, a perver&s;ion of the principles of our govern|ment, which is more ea&s;ily wrought, may be as wounding to the upright republican.</P>
<P>With regard to England's renewing her claim to the country, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that ill policy abroad, and anar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y at home, &s;hould invite her to it, I am clearly of opinion it would not be her intere&s;t to do it; for, if &s;he &s;hould &s;ucceed, the extent and rapid growth of the country would prevent its being long tributary to that di&s;tant i&s;land. I am al&s;o fully convinced, that the late and pre&s;ent mini&s;try of England did not, and do not, with for the re-union of the country upon any other terms than as a farm, from which &s;he is to derive <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial revenue,</HI> without allowing the tenant any vote in the di&s;po&s;ition of it. But we are not to calculate what is only the real intere&s;t of a nation, who&s;e monarch has the right of making peace and war. Suppo&s;e the inclination of the pre&s;ent king &s;hould not lead him to reclaim the country; yet, his &s;on, when he comes to the throne, may be ambitious for the glory of recovering the lo&s;t dominion of his father. And as to the difficulty of obtaining money from parliament to carry on an unrea&s;onable war, the rapid corruption of that people will pro|bably &s;oon remove it.</P>
<P>There is no other way of preventing this probable corruption of opinion, but by removing the cau&s;e, which I have a&s;ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to be the mal-contents of America. Having, as we pre&s;ume, &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity, let us now, as propo&s;ed, enquire if honour and equity will con&s;ent to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The treaty which ju&s;tice and honour forbid us to violate, does
<PB N="22" REF="018367_0021_0FA6A5723990E488">not, even upon &s;o liberal a con&s;truction, as I believe Phocion him|&s;elf would give it, debar the &s;tates from making laws that may be &s;alutary to the government, and advantageous to the people, though in their con&s;equences they may operate again&s;t the intere&s;t of the &s;ubjects of England. Suppo&s;e a line to be drawn, and the de&s;erving of tho&s;e, who by treaty are made &s;ubjects of England, &s;hould be re-adopted, and inve&s;ted with all the privi|leges of citizens; and, after this, laws &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed, giv|ing the citizens the exclu&s;ive benents of trade. This law would operate no more again&s;t the &s;ubjects of England that are here, than again&s;t tho&s;e who are at home, except in this, the effect of the law in one ca&s;e, &s;ends the&s;e home, and in the other ca&s;e, keeps them there, or rather prevents their coming here as traders.</P>
<P>There was a time when the people of England con&s;idered them|&s;elves in danger from a corruption of opinion of another kind &mdash; I mean of religious opinion. Few prote&s;tants complained of it as unju&s;t or di&s;honourable, that the government enacted laws to &s;up|pre&s;s the growth of the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>A government has a clearer right to interfere in checking the promulgation of depravity in political, than in religious opinion. If the tory principle &s;hould be repre&s;&s;ed in this way, it is a remedy u&s;ed for the health and pre&s;ervation of the body politic, and as &s;uch no one, not even the tories, can complain of it as unju&s;t, though they may deprecate the hard&s;hip of the mea&s;ure as applied to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, that is again&s;t laws for exclu&s;ive trade, it has been objected, that by removing the&s;e people we remove a great part of the &s;ilver, and gold out of the &s;tate. With as much pro|priety it may be argued again&s;t the mea&s;ure, that we &s;hould remove a great part of the writing paper out of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Money is a conveniency, not an article of trade; being &s;uch, wherever trade centers money will. The importance of this city, as a place of trade, is not owing to the quantity of money that is now in it, or that ever was in it, at any one time. It is with effects that we trade, and the mercantile con&s;equence of this town ari&s;es from its being central to the effects of this and the adjoining &s;tates, and the conveniency of its water communication. Suppo&s;e this city traded only with the effects of this &s;tate, then its quantity of trade would be in exact proportion to the annual produce of the &s;tate, though there &s;hould not be an ounce of &s;ilver or gold in the place to-morrow.</P>
<P>Another objection &s;till more futile has been made again&s;t a law for exclu&s;ive trade. That we prevent the merchants of England from coming over and &s;ettling with us, and their &s;hips from vi&s;iting us, which would be a dreadful misfortune to the trading intere&s;t of the &s;tate. "Open your arms, or ports," (I do not remember which) &s;aid the writer of a hand bill, "to the &s;hips of foreign nations."</P>
<P>Unle&s;s Congre&s;s &s;hould have in contemplation to give &s;ome par|ticular privileges to the French nation, and to which I &s;hall have no
<PB N="23" REF="018367_0022_0FA6A572F930CAF8">objection, I declare I have not a wi&s;h ever to &s;ee a foreign ve&s;&s;el, or a foreign merchant, vi&s;it this continent, except as a tra|veller. I would not be under&s;tood to wi&s;h a prohibition of foreign ve&s;&s;els to our harbours; but I wi&s;h they may be di&s;couraged, by encouraging &s;hip-building here. With us, who have it in our power to make ve&s;&s;els and naval &s;tores, articles of export; and who want articles of export &s;o much, would it be to our intere&s;t to carry on our trade in foreign bottoms? &mdash; With regard to foreign merchants, it is well known that there are, at pre&s;ent, more adventurers in trade, in America, than there is trade to &s;upport, <HI>that is,</HI> the &s;pirit of trade is more than in proportion to its quantity. When foreign merchants migrate to the two Ameri|cas, it is generally with a view to mend or make their fortunes, and to return home and enjoy them. Can &s;uch men feel them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the welfare of our government? Is it not more pro|bable that they will &s;till con&s;ider them&s;elves of the nation which they left; and as far as they have influence in the government, u&s;e it for the intere&s;t of their own nation, to which they &s;till feel them&s;elves belonging? Would it then be &s;o e&s;&s;entially our duty to encourage &s;uch &s;ettlers to &s;upplant our own traders; and who, if they acquire fortunes, is it probable they will be u&s;ed to the benefit of our government?</P>
<P>There is a kind of &s;ettlers that I could wi&s;h might be encouraged from all countries; the&s;e are hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers. When the&s;e migrate, they do it with a view to remain where they &s;ettle. Be&s;ide the&s;e, &s;cientific men of all kinds &s;hould be encourag|ed to vi&s;it us. For, whether they become permanent re&s;idents or not, they are u&s;eful while they do &s;tay.</P>
<P>I would encourage hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers to come to the country, and di&s;courage traders, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that I would encourage articles of export, and di&s;courage articles of im|port, by holding out bounties on the one &s;ide, and impo&s;ts on the other.</P>
<P>So general is the cry of the balance of trade being again&s;t America, that the blockhead who wants &s;kill to balance his cane, will put on the face o bu&s;ine&s;s, and tell me, "the balance of trade is again&s;t us." Will importing foreign merchants into the country tend to place this balance in its favour. The truth is, a balance of trade cannot exi&s;t again&s;t a country longer than a year or two. For if the imports of this year exceed the exports, the balance mu&s;t be paid the next year. If the articles of export &s;hould not be &s;o increa&s;ed, as by the next year to make up the balance, then the articles of import will be proportionably dimini&s;hed. A balance cannot be always due. The imports and exports mu&s;t, in the long run, bear an exact proportion to each other. If our exports are &s;mall, our imports mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;mall.</P>
<P>The nation then cannot abound in foreign productions; they cannot be in a &s;tate of affluence.</P>
<P>This teaches us a plain and &s;imple truth, viz. That the riches of a nation are derived from the cultivation of its land, and its
<PB N="24" REF="018367_0023_0FA6A5C878C6C658">manufacturies. Merchants are the agents of the farmers and ma|nufacturers, to exchange their commodities for tho&s;e of other countries, which this will not produce.</P>
<P>This is a &s;imple &s;tate of the ca&s;e; I wi&s;h I had lei&s;ure to enter more fully into it.</P>
<P>To increa&s;e the wealth of our &s;tate then, we &s;hould invite hu&s;|handmen and manufacturers into the country, and look coldly on traders, for that part of our community is already too numerous, and will probably cau&s;e the temporary inconvenience which I have mentioned, of placing the balance of trade again&s;t us for a time, which mu&s;t create a &s;carcity of foreign commodities for &s;ome time after. Unle&s;s greater exertions in cultivating the land &s;hould im|mediately &s;ucceed it and make up the balance.</P>
<P>Phocion's letter being e&s;&s;entially, though not minutely an&s;wered, &s;ome of his arguments which are not noticed, depending upon principles which have been di&s;proved, &s;ome not applying at all to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, and &s;ome in reality unexceptionable, I will take leave of my reader, after ob&s;erving, that I do not wi&s;h the policy of the &s;tate to take into con&s;ideration the &s;mall &s;inner from the ignorant. Our government is in no danger: It is the bell-weathers of the flock that we &s;hould guard again&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no form of government &s;o delicate in its nature, and which requires &s;o much attention to pre&s;erve, as that which exi&s;ts in the minds of the people. While corruption is kept out of it, there is no form of government &s;o honourable to men, and &s;o happy to the partaker of it; and when corrupted, there is no go|vernment &s;o much to be dete&s;ted and avoided. Con&s;idering things in this point of view, and con&s;idering what it has co&s;t us to e&s;ta|bli&s;h this government, what it would have co&s;t us if we had failed in it, I am not willing to ui&s;le with the acqui&s;ition. To ri&s;que it from a fal&s;e notion of genero&s;ity, or becau&s;e it is ea&s;y for Phoci|on and others to be&s;tow the epithet of vindictive on the &s;alutary mea&s;ures that may be propo&s;ed for its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>We did at the commencement of the war, and have in the whole cour&s;e of it, kept it in view as a debt which we owed to po&s;terity, to bequeath to them that liberty which we recived from our an|ce&s;tors. Having got this in our power by an hazardous and dread|ful conflict, to &s;uffer the ine&s;timable acqui&s;ition to peri&s;h by neglect, would be not only to betray them but our&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>PHOCION's SECOND LETTER, CONTAINING REMARKS; ON MENTOR's REPLY.</HEAD>
<P>THE little ha&s;ty production, under the &s;ignature of PHOCION, has met with a more favourable reception from the public, than was expected. The force of plain truth has carried it along again&s;t the &s;tream of prejudice; and the princi|ples, it holds out, have gained ground, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e, who were either too angry, or too much intere&s;ted to be convinced. Men of this de&s;cription, have, till lately, contented them&s;elves with virulent invectives again&s;t the Writer, without attempting to an&s;wer his arguments; but alarmed at the progre&s;s of the &s;entiments advocated by him, one of them has at la&s;t come forward with an an&s;wer; with what degree of &s;ucce&s;s, let tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t partial to his opinion, determine.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that the an&s;wer of Mentor is a feeble attempt, would be no derogation from his abilities; for, in fact, the cau&s;e he e&s;pou|&s;es, admits of nothing &s;olid; and, as one of its partizans, he is only to be blamed for not knowing its weak &s;ides better, than to have been tempted to expo&s;e it to the experiment of a defence.</P>
<P>BUT, before I enter farther into the &s;ubject, I &s;hall take occa|&s;ion to acknowledge, with regret, the injudicious appearance of warmth in my former letter; calculated, with many minds, to rai&s;e prejudices again&s;t the truths it contains, and liable to be mi&s;repre&s;ented into a general cen&s;ure on that part of the commu|nity, who&s;e zeal, &s;acrifices and &s;ufferings mu&s;t ever render them re&s;pectable to the true friends of the revolution. I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve in apology (as is truly the ca&s;e) that whatever &s;everity of animadver&s;ion may have been indulged, was wholly directed again&s;t a <HI>very &s;mall</HI> number of men, who are manife&s;tly aiming at nothing, but the acqui&s;ition of power and profit to them&s;elves; and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to gratify their avidity for the&s;e objects, would trample upon every thing &s;acred in &s;ociety, and overturn the foundations of public and private &s;ecurity. It is difficult for a man, con&s;cious of a pure attachment to the public weal, who &s;ees it invaded and
<PB N="28" REF="018367_0026_0FA6A5CB78B24C28">endangered by &s;uch men, under &s;pecious but fal&s;e pretences, either to think, or to &s;peak of their conduct, without indignation. It is equally difficult for one, who in que&s;tions that affect the com|munity, regards <HI>principles</HI> only, and not <HI>men,</HI> to look with indif|ference on attempts to make the great principles of &s;ocial right, ju&s;tice and honour, the victims of per&s;onal animo&s;ity or party intrigue.</P>
<P>MORE tenderne&s;s is indeed due to the mi&s;takes of tho&s;e, who have &s;uffered too much to rea&s;on with impartiality, who&s;e hone&s;t prejudices, grown into habits by the impre&s;&s;ions of an eight years war, cannot at once accommodate them&s;elves to that &s;y&s;tem which the public good requires, and who&s;e &s;ituations are le&s;s favourable to di&s;tingui&s;hing between doctrines invented to &s;erve the turn of a revolution, and tho&s;e which mu&s;t give permanent pro&s;perity to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations I have thought proper to premi&s;e, in ju&s;|tice to my own intentions, and I &s;hall now proceed, as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, to examine the &s;ugge&s;tions of Mentor, inter&s;per&s;ing as I go along, &s;ome remarks on objections which though omitted by him, have been urged in other &s;hapes again&s;t the principles of Phocion.</P>
<P>MENTOR propo&s;es to treat the &s;entiments of Phocion as a poli|tical novelty, but if he is &s;erious, it is a proof that he is not even "tolerably well informed." They are as old as any regular no|tions of free government among mankind, and are to be met with, not only in every &s;peculative Writer, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, but are interwoven in the theory and practice of that code, which con&s;ti|tutes the law of the land. They &s;peak the common language of this country at the beginning of the revolution, and are e&s;&s;ential to its future happine&s;s and re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>THE principles of all the arguments I have u&s;ed or &s;hall u&s;e, lie within the compa&s;s of a few &s;imple propo&s;itions, which, to be a&s;&s;ented to, need only to be &s;tated.</P>
<P>FIRST, That no man can forfeit or be ju&s;tly deprived, without his con&s;ent, of any right, to which as a member of the commu|nity he is entitled, but for &s;ome crime incurring the forfeiture.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, That no man ought to be condemned unheard, or puni&s;hed for &s;uppo&s;ed offences, without having an opportunity of making his defence. <HI>See Addre&s;s of Congre&s;s to the people of Great Britain, September</HI> 5, 1774.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, That a crime is <HI>an act</HI> committed or omitted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it. &mdash; <HI>Black&s;tone, Vol. IV. page</HI> 5.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, That a pro&s;ecution is in its mo&s;t preci&s;e &s;ignifica|tion, an <HI>inquiry</HI> or <HI>mode of a&s;certaining,</HI> whether a particular per|son has committed, or omitted &s;uch <HI>act.</HI></P>
<P>FIFTHLY, That <HI>duties</HI> and <HI>rights</HI> as applied to &s;ubjects are re|ciprocal; or in other words, that a man cannot be a <HI>citizen</HI> for the purpo&s;e of puni&s;hment, and not a <HI>citizen</HI> for the purpo&s;e of privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="018367_0027_0FA6A5CC385F1378">
THESE propo&s;itions will hardly be controverted by any man profe&s;&s;ing to be a friend to civil liberty. The application of them will more fully appear hereafter.</P>
<P>BY the declaration of Independence on the 4th of July, in the year 1776, acceded to by our Convention on the ninth, the late colony of New-York became an independent &s;tate. All the inha|bitants, who were &s;ubjects under the former government, and who did not withdraw them&s;elves upon the change which took place, were to be con&s;idered as citizens, owing allegiance to the new government, This, at lea&s;t, is the legal pre&s;umption; and this was the principle, in fact, upon which all the mea&s;ures of our public councils have been grounded. Duties have been exacted, and puni&s;hments inflicted according to this rule. If any excepti|ons to it were to be admitted, they could only flow from the <HI>in|dulgence</HI> of the &s;tate to &s;uch individuals, as from peculiar circum|&s;tances might de&s;ire to be permitted to &s;tand upon a different footing.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the &s;outhern di&s;trict, before they fell under the power of the Briti&s;h army, were as much citizens of the &s;tate as the inhabitants of other parts of it. They mu&s;t, therefore, con|tinue to be &s;uch, unle&s;s they have been divided of that character by &s;ome po&s;terior circum&s;tance. This circum&s;tance mu&s;t, either be</P>
<P>&mdash;THEIR having, by the fortune of war, fallen under the power of the Briti&s;h army.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;THEIR having forfeited their claim by their own mi&s;con|duct.</P>
<P>&mdash;THEIR having been left out of the compact by &s;ome &s;ub&s;e|quent a&s;&s;ociation of the body of the &s;tate, or</P>
<P>&mdash;THEIR having been di&s;membered by treaty.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances according to the fundamental principles of government, and the con&s;tant practice of nations could have no effect in working a forfeiture of their citizen&s;hip.</P>
<P>To allow it &s;uch an effect, would be to convert misfortune into guilt; it would be in many in&s;tances, to make the negligence of the &s;ociety, in not providing adequate means of defence for the &s;everal parts, the crime of tho&s;e parts which were the immediate &s;ufferers by that negligence. It would tend to the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety, by loo&s;ening the ties which bind the different parts to|gether, and ju&s;tifying the&s;e who &s;hould for a moment fall under the power of a conqueror, not merely in yielding &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as was exacted from them, but in taking a willing, in|tere&s;ted and deci&s;ive part with him.</P>
<P>IT was the policy of the revolution, to inculcate upon every citizen the obligation of renouncing his habitation, property, and every private concern for the &s;ervice of his country, and many of us have &s;carcely ye learned to con&s;ider it as le&s;s than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have acted in a different manner, But it is time we &s;hould correct the exuberances of opinions propagated through policy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> from enthu&s;ia&s;m; and while we admit, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who did act
<PB N="30" REF="018367_0028_0FA6A5CCF84BE938">&s;o di&s;intere&s;ted and noble a part, de&s;erve the applau&s;e and, wher|ever they can be be&s;towed with propriety the rewards of their country, we &s;hould cea&s;e to impute indi&s;criminate guilt to tho&s;e, who, &s;ubmitting to the accidents of war, remained with their habi|tions and property. We &s;hould learn, that this conduct is tolerated by the general &s;en&s;e of mankind; and that according to that &s;en&s;e, whenever the &s;tate recovers the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch parts as were for a time &s;ubdued, the citizens return at once to all the rights, to which they were formerly entitled.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd head of forfeiture by mi&s;conduct, there is is no doubt, that all &s;uch as remaining within the Briti&s;h lines, did not merely yield an obedience, which they could not refu&s;e, without ruin; but took a voluntary and intere&s;ted part with the enemy, in carrying on the war, became &s;ubject to the penalties of trea&s;on. They could not however, by that conduct, make them&s;elves aliens, becau&s;e though they were bound to pay a tem|porary and qualified obedience to the conqueror, they could not transfer their eventual allegiance from the &s;tate to a foreign pow|er. By becoming aliens too, they would have cea&s;ed to be trai|tors; and all the laws of the &s;tate pa&s;&s;ed during the revolution, by which they are con&s;idered and puni&s;hed as &s;ubjects, would have been, by that con&s;truction, unintelligence and unju&s;t. The idea indeed of citizens transforming them&s;elves into aliens, by taking part again&s;t the &s;tate, to which they belong, is altogether of new-invention, unknown and inadmi&s;&s;ible in law, and contrary to the nature of the &s;ocial compact.</P>
<P>BUT were this not the ca&s;e, an in&s;urmountable difficulty would &s;till remain, for how &s;hall we a&s;certain who are aliens or traitors, let us call them which we will. It has been &s;een that the boun|daries of the Briti&s;h lines cannot determine the que&s;tion; for this would be to &s;ay, that the merely falling under the power of the Briti&s;h army, con&s;tituted every man a <HI>traitor</HI> or an <HI>alien.</HI> It would be to confound one third of the citizens of the &s;tate in promi&s;cu|ous guilt and degradation, without evidence, or enquiry. It would be to make crime, which are in their nature per&s;onal and indivi|dual, aggregate and territorial. Shall we go into a enquiry to a&s;certain the crime of each per&s;on? <HI>This would be a pro&s;ecution; [See propo&s;ition 4th.]</HI> and the treaty forbids all future pro&s;ecutions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Legi&s;lature take the map and make a geographical de|lineation of the rights and di&s;qualifications of its citizens? This would be to mea&s;ure innocence and guilt, by latitude and longi|tude&mdash;It would be <HI>condemn</HI> and <HI>puni&s;h,</HI> not one man, but thou&s;ands for <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed effences,</HI> without giving them an oppor|tunity of making their defence. God forbid that &s;uch an act of barefaced tyranny &s;hould ever di&s;grace our hi&s;tory! God forbid that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> body of the people &s;hould be corrupt enough to wi&s;h it, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubmitted it!</P>
<P>BUT here we are informed by Mentor, that the treaty, in&s;tead of offering any ob&s;tacle to the views of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to meta|morpho&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="018367_0029_0FA6A5CDB82277D8">their fellow citizens into aliens, is preci&s;ely the thing which removes the difficulty. Mentor is thus far right; that if they are aliens at all, it mu&s;t be by &s;ome &s;tipulation in the treaty, but it requires not a little dexterity to &s;hew, that &s;uch a &s;tipulation exi&s;ts. If it exi&s;ts at all, it mu&s;t be collected from the 5th and 6th articles. Let us, by analyzing the&s;e articles, try if we can find it out.</P>
<P>THE fifth article &s;peaks in the fir&s;t clau&s;e of <HI>real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects</HI> who&s;e e&s;tates <HI>had been confi&s;cated,</HI> and &s;tipulates that Congre&s;s &s;hall recommend a re&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd clau&s;e it &s;peaks of <HI>per&s;ons re&s;ident</HI> in di&s;tricts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h forces, who had not borne arms again&s;t the United States of who&s;e e&s;tates, <HI>al&s;o confi&s;cated,</HI> Congre&s;s are in like manner to recommend a re&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN the third clau&s;e, per&s;ons of every other de&s;cription are com|prehended, who are to be permitted to remain twelve months un|mole&s;ted, in any of the &s;tates, to &s;olicit a re&s;toration of their pro|perty, which <HI>had been confi&s;cated;</HI> Congre&s;s recommending, even with re&s;pect to them, a re&s;titution, on condition of their refunding to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, where there had been a &s;ale, the <HI>bona fiac</HI> price given by them for the e&s;tates in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is apparent from the di&s;&s;ection of the article, that the inha|bitants in the Southern di&s;trict, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h army, are not confounded in one general ma&s;s of alieni&s;m, as has been a&s;&s;ert|ed. We find the expre&s;s words of de&s;cripition are <HI>real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,</HI> and as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from them, <HI>per&s;ons re&s;ident</HI> in di&s;tricts within the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h arms. The&s;e la&s;t, by the <HI>letter</HI> as well as the &s;pirit of the article are deemed <HI>not Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no intelligible medium, between a real Briti&s;h &s;ubject, and one that is not Briti&s;h &s;ubject at all. A man either <HI>is</HI> or <HI>is not</HI> the &s;ubject of a country. The word <HI>real,</HI> as applied to the affirmative, is a redundancy. Its natural contra&s;ts are <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>pretended.</HI> If we &s;hould call the per&s;ons of other de&s;criptions in the article <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>pretended</HI> Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, in&s;tead of ju&s;tifying, it would exclude the con&s;truction given by Mentor. For if they were only <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>pretended</HI> Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, they mu&s;t be real American &s;ubjects; or in other words, if they were not <HI>real</HI> Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which by nece&s;&s;ary implication they are declared not to be, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be American &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE phra&s;e <HI>real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,</HI> &s;trictly con&s;idered, is innac|curate; but its practical import, with the help of a little candor, is ea&s;ily fixed. It is well known that in this and other &s;tates, the property of per&s;ons, who had never been &s;ubjects of this country, before or after the revolution, but who had truly been &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, had in many in&s;tances been confi&s;cated. Sir Henry Clinton, the late Governor Tryon, Lord Dunmore, are examples among us of the real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in the contemplation of the treaty. All the re&s;t are of cour&s;e American &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="018367_0030_0FA6A5CE785A0A68">
To under&s;tand the fifth and &s;ixth articles relatively, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that all the different cla&s;&s;es de&s;cribed in the fifth article agree in one <HI>common quality;</HI> they are all per&s;ons who&s;e <HI>property had been already confi&s;cated.</HI> I have placed this fact in a pointed view; becau&s;e it &s;hews inconte&s;tibly, that the per&s;ons who are the objects of the fifth article, and tho&s;e who are the objects of the &s;ixth, are totally different. The one relates to per&s;ons who&s;e property had been confi&s;cated, and <HI>aims</HI> at re&s;titution; the other relates to tho&s;e who&s;e property had not yet been confi&s;cated, who were not actually &s;uffering the &s;entence of the law, and has for object to prevent future pro&s;ecutions, confi&s;cations, or injuries to individu|als on account to their conduct in the war.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;tinction &s;olves the &s;eeming contradiction between the fifth and &s;ixth articles; the former providing for the future re&s;i|dence of per&s;ons of a particular de&s;cription within the &s;tate for a twevle month; the other prohibiting all future injury or damage to per&s;ons, liberty or property. At fir&s;t &s;ight, the great extent of the latter provi&s;ion appears to &s;uper&s;ede, and render ab&s;urd, the former; but the two articles are reconciled, by con&s;idering tho&s;e, who had already &s;uffered the &s;entence of the law, as not within the purview of the &s;ixth article, to arre&s;t or remit that &s;entence; while all others again&s;t whom &s;entence had not pa&s;&s;ed, are within the protection of the &s;ixth article. It does not operate with a retro&s;pective and re&s;torative influence, but looks forward and &s;tops the futre current of pro&s;ecution and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate, in a more &s;triking manner, the fallacy of Men|tor's comment upon the treaty, I &s;hall give a recital of it, with &s;ome explanatory additions, the fairne&s;s of which I think will not be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>"IN the &s;ixth article (&s;ays he) it is provided that <HI>no one &s;hall "&s;uffer</HI> in his per&s;on, liberty, or property, on account of the part he many have taken in the war;" and yet though no one, con|&s;i&s;tently with the treaty, can hereafter &s;uffer in either of tho&s;e re|&s;pects, yet many, con&s;i&s;tently with the treaty, may be declared aliens, may be &s;tripped of the mo&s;t valuable rights of citizen&s;hip, and may be bani&s;hed from the &s;tate, without injury to per&s;on, liberty, or property, "The fifth article," though it &s;peaks of none but tho&s;e who have already had their e&s;tates confi&s;cated, "de&s;cribes the per&s;ons provided for by the &s;ixth," which indeed &s;ays, that there <HI>&s;hall be</HI> no future pro&s;ecutions, nor confi&s;cations, nor injury to per&s;on, liberty, or porperty; but this only means, that there &s;hall be no future pro&s;ecutions commenced again&s;t tho&s;e, who have been already <HI>attainted and bani&s;hed,</HI> nor confi&s;cations made of the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who&s;e e&s;tates <HI>have been already confi&s;ca|ted,</HI> nor injuries done to the per&s;ons, liberty, and property, of tho&s;e, who are already to be e&s;teemed <HI>dead in law</HI> by attainder and exile; but with re&s;pect to all tho&s;e who have not been alrea|dy <HI>attainted, bani&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>&s;ubjected to confi&s;cation,</HI> (the only
<PB N="33" REF="018367_0031_0FA6A5CF37F6B8A0">per&s;ons comprehended in the fifth article and provided for in the &s;ixth) we may pro&s;ecute, bani&s;h, confi&s;cate, disfranchi&s;e, and do whatever el&s;e we think proper. The fifth article &s;tipulates the good offices of Congre&s;s for tho&s;e, who have been already ruined, and the &s;ixth benignly takes care that they &s;hall not be ruined a &s;econd time; but leaves all others to their de&s;tiny and our mercy. <Q>The fifth article, di&s;tingui&s;hes, the per&s;ons who are the objects of it, into three cla&s;&s;es&mdash; Fir&s;t, tho&s;e who are real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &mdash; The &s;econd, tho&s;e</Q> (meaning Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who were not real Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, de&s;cribed by the appellation of per&s;ons re&s;ident in di&s;tricts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h forces) <Q>who had not taken arms again&s;t the country&mdash; The third cla&s;s are de&s;cri|bed by the provi&s;ion that is made for them, viz. They &s;hall have liberty to go into any part of the United States for twelve months to &s;olicit a re&s;toration of their e&s;tates, that may have been confi&s;cated. This cla&s;s mu&s;t be tho&s;e who belonging to America, have taken arms again&s;t their country. The fir&s;t and &s;econd cla&s;s it is agreed, that Congre&s;s &s;hall recommend to the &s;tates a re&s;toration of their property. The third it &s;eems were too infamous for the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to a&s;k any con&s;ideration for, except the wretched privilege of a&s;king it for them&s;elves,</Q> though in fact, with re&s;pect even to them, it is expre&s;&s;ly &s;tipu|lated, that Congre&s;s &s;hall recommend a re&s;toration of their e&s;tates, rights and properties, on paying to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors the <HI>bona fide</HI> price given for them, where there has been an actual &s;ale. <Q>But (continues he) I can find no where even a reque&s;t, and that only implied, that any of the three cla&s;&s;es may dwell among us, and enjoy the immunities and privileges of citizens; for the fir&s;t cla&s;s are con&s;idered as former &s;ubjects; the &s;econd and third as acquired &s;ubjects of England,</Q> <HI>acquired</HI> but not <HI>real.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee, by taking the out-lines of Mentor's con&s;truction, and filing up the canva&s;s in a manner &s;uited to the de&s;ign, the whole is a groupe of ab&s;urdities; or in other words by connecting the con&s;equences with the principles of his comment, on the treaty, the re&s;ult is too ridiculous not to &s;trike the meane&s;t under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t appear by this time manife&s;t, that there is nothing in the terms of the treaty, which countenances the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e who have been within the Briti&s;h lines are con&s;idered and &s;tipulated for as aliens. One ground, upon which this idea has been originally adopted, was that it would have been improper to have &s;tipulated for them at all, if they were not aliens; but I have &s;hown in my former letter, that a &s;tipulation for &s;ubjects, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, has been far from unprecedented.</P>
<P>A good criterion by which to determine the meaning of the treaty, in this re&s;pect, is to recur to the impre&s;&s;ions that it made, on its fir&s;t appearance; before there had been time to contrive and &s;ub&s;titute an artificial to the natural and obvious &s;en&s;e of the
<PB N="34" REF="018367_0032_0FA6A5D063222BD0">words. Every man, by appealing to his own bo&s;om, will recol|lect, that he was at fir&s;t &s;truck with an opinion that the di&s;affected were &s;ecured from every future deprivation and injury whatever; and however many may have been chagrined at the idea, that they &s;hould be admitted to a parity of privileges with tho&s;e who had &s;upported the revolution, none doubted that this was the &s;en&s;e of the treaty. Indeed the principal doubt &s;eemed to be, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, whether the &s;ixth article was not &s;o broad, as to protect even tho&s;e, who had been attainted, from per&s;onal injury, in ca&s;e of their return within the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, in this place, revive the que&s;tion of the power of Congre&s;s to make this &s;tipulation; not only becau&s;e Mentor ap|pears to have conceded this point, and to acknowledge our obliga|tion to a faithful ob&s;ervance of the treaty; but becau&s;e what has been offered in my former letter on this head, mu&s;t continue to appear to me to be ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive; until &s;ome &s;atisfactory limits can be a&s;&s;igned to the powers of war, peace and treaty, ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, other than tho&s;e I have mentioned,&mdash; the public &s;afety and the fundamental con&s;titutions of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHEN any different and intelligible line &s;hall be drawn&mdash; I will give up the que&s;tion, if I cannot &s;hew it is inadmi&s;&s;ible in practice.</P>
<P>THE common intere&s;ts of humanity, and the general tranquili|ty of the world, require that the power of making peace, wher|ever lodged, &s;hould be con&s;trued and exerci&s;ed liberally; and even in ca&s;es where its extent may be doubtful, it is the policy of all wi&s;e nations to give it latitude rather than confine it. The exigencies of a community, in time of war, are &s;o various and often &s;o critical, that it would be extremely dangerous to pre&s;cribe narrow bounds to that power, by which it is to be re&s;tored. The con&s;equence might frequently be a diffidence of our engagements, and a prolongation of the calamities of war.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper, in this place, to an&s;wer an objection which has been made to a po&s;ition contained in my former letter. It is there laid down as a rule, that the breach of a &s;ingle article of a treaty annuls the whole. The rea&s;on of this rule is, that every article is to be regarded as the con&s;ideration of &s;ome other article.</P>
<P>THIS has given occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that a breach of the treaty on the part of the Briti&s;h, in &s;ending away a great number of negroes, has upon my principles long &s;ince annihilated the treaty, and left us at perfect liberty to de&s;ert the &s;tipulation, on our part.</P>
<P>THIS admits of an ea&s;y and &s;olid an&s;wer. The breach of one article annuls the whole; if the &s;ide injured by it choo&s;es to take advantage of it to di&s;&s;olve the treaty; [<HI>Vatel page</HI> 130 <HI>Section</HI> 48.] but if its intere&s;t dictates a different conduct it may wave the breach and let the obligation of the treaty continue. The power of determining whether the treaty has been broken properly be|longs
<PB N="35" REF="018367_0033_0FA6A5D2911B3DF0">to that body who made it. Congre&s;s have wi&s;ely taken a different cour&s;e, and in&s;tead of reviving the &s;tate of ho&s;tility by declaring the treaty void, have proceeded upon the pre&s;umption of its continuing in force; and by &s;ub&s;equent acts have given it additional validity and &s;trength. The definitive treaty has been &s;ince concluded, and proclaimed with a remarkable &s;olemnity and energy for the ob&s;ervance of the citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>THE third mode mentioned, by which the inhabitants of the &s;outhern di&s;trict may have lo&s;t their rights of citizen&s;hip, is their having been left out of the compact by &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;ociati|on of the body of the &s;tate. The fact however is directly the rever&s;e; for not only the con&s;titution makes provi&s;ion for the repre&s;entation of the people of the &s;outhern di&s;trict in the Legi&s;lature, but during the whole war, by an ordinance of the Convention, who framed the con&s;titution, an actual repre&s;entation has been kept up in a manner, the regularity of which (whatever might have been the expedience of it) was more than que&s;tionable; as all elections were &s;u&s;pended in that part of the &s;tate This circum&s;tance of a con&s;tant repre&s;enta|tion of the inhabitants of the Southern di&s;trict in the Legi&s;lature, during the war, is in a rational as well as a legal light a conclu|&s;ive refutation of the pretended alieni&s;m of tho&s;e inhabitants by any event of the war, or by any other matter that applies to them in a collective view antecedent to the treaty of peace. To this it may be added, that a variety of the laws of the &s;tate, in the cour&s;e of the war, &s;uppo&s;e and treat the inhabitants of the Sou|thern di&s;trict as &s;ubjects; owing allegiance to the &s;tate, and con|&s;equently having the rights which &s;ubjects in general enjoy under the government. <HI>[See Po&s;ition 5th]</HI></P>
<P>THE argument is &s;till &s;tronger when we attend to what has been done by the government &s;ince the re&s;toration of its juri&s;dic|tion in the Southern di&s;trict. We did not wait till a bill of natu|ralization was pa&s;&s;ed, to remove the di&s;abilities of the inhabitants, before we proceeded to elections. We did not confine tho&s;e elec|tions to &s;uch per&s;ons only, as had re&s;ided without the Briti&s;h lines, but left them open to all de&s;criptions of per&s;ons, who would choo&s;e to take the oath pre&s;cribed for that purpo&s;e, by the Council. Few indeed in this city, be&s;ides tho&s;e who had been ab&s;ent, did in fact vote at the elections: but a con&s;iderable number did in the counties. And if we &s;hould admit the doctrine of the general alieni&s;m of the inhabitants of the Southern di&s;trict, either before, or in con&s;equence of the treaty of peace, a curious que&s;tion not ea&s;y to be &s;olved, would ari&s;e as to the validity of the election of many individuals now holding &s;eats in Senate and A&s;&s;embly. So far as an act of government can decide the point in controver&s;y, it is already decided. The Council for the temporary government of the Southern di&s;trict in appointing the mode of election &mdash; the conduct of the legi&s;lature &s;ince in admitting the members elected in that mode, are uncon&s;titutional; or the inhabitants at large of the Southern di&s;trict, either by the treaty, or any antecedent cir|cum&s;tance, are not aliens.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="018367_0034_0FA6A5D2F88DA558">
I have dwelt the more largely on this head, not only becau&s;e the idea of a general alieni&s;m of the inhabitants of the Southern di&s;trict is the ground Mentor has taken; but becau&s;e &s;ome per|&s;ons who have it in their power to make a mi&s;chievous u&s;e of it, are endeavouring to give it circulation, where, if it could pre|vail, it might lead to pernicious con&s;equences. Pre&s;&s;ed by the difficulty of di&s;crimination tho&s;e, who may have forfeited the rights of citizen&s;hip from tho&s;e who have not, without a manife&s;t violation as well of the con&s;titution, as of the treaty of peace, they are willing if po&s;&s;ible to devi&s;e &s;ome general expedient to evade both; and the one they have hit upon is, to declare all tho&s;e aliens, who lived within the Briti&s;h lines during the war, on the mi&s;erable pretence that they are made &s;uch by the treaty.</P>
<P>THUS we have another example how ea&s;y it is for men to change their principles with their &s;ituations &mdash; to be zea|lous advocates for the rights of the citizens when they are invaded by others, and as &s;oon as they have it in their power, to become the invaders them&s;elves &mdash; to re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of power, when it is in the hands of others, and the moment they get it into their own to make bolder &s;trides than tho&s;e they have re&s;i&s;ted. &mdash; Are &s;uch men to be &s;anctified with the hallowed name of patriots? Are they not rather to be branded as men who make their pa&s;|&s;ions, prejudices and intere&s;ts the &s;ole mea&s;ure of their own and others rights?</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of mankind is too full of the&s;e melancholy in&s;tan|ces of human contradiction.</P>
<P>HAVING mentioned the oath directed to be pre&s;cribed to elec|tors in the Southern di&s;trict, by the Council for the temporary go|vernment; I &s;hall take occa&s;ion, in this place, with freedom, but with re&s;pect, to examine the propriety of that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure as founded upon an act of the legi&s;lature of of this &s;tate pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome year declaring, that per&s;ons who had been guilty of certain matters particularized in that act, &s;hould be forever after di&s;qualified from voting at all public electi|ons. I confine my&s;elf for the &s;ake of brevity to the general idea of the act. The embarra&s;&s;ment with the Council, no doubt, was, how to a&s;certain the per&s;ons who had incurred the di&s;ability. As the matters, to which that di&s;ability related, were of a &s;pecific na|ture, it was nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould be &s;pecifically a&s;certained be|fore the law could have its effect.</P>
<P>THE Council, therefore, could not &s;atisfy that law, by declaring all tho&s;e di&s;qualified, who had re&s;ided within the Briti&s;h lines during the war. They would not leave the operation of it to a cour&s;e of judicial inve&s;tigation and deci&s;ion, becau&s;e this would be to fly in the &s;ave of the treaty, and appearances were to be pre&s;erv|ed. This con&s;ideration was &s;trengthened by another. The cour&s;e of the law mu&s;t have been dilatory. The elections were to be entered upon. It was deemed inexpedient, that the voice of the citizens at large (which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e if the act of the
<PB N="37" REF="018367_0035_0FA6A5D3B9395290">legi&s;lature, in que&s;tion, had been left to its natural cour&s;e) &s;hould govern the&s;e elections. If the returning citizens were not at this juncture gratified, tumults were by &s;ome apprehended.</P>
<P>THIS was a plau&s;ible &s;tep, and on that account the more danger|ous. If we examine it with an unprejudiced eye, we mu&s;t ac|knowledge not only that it was an eva&s;ion of the treaty, but a &s;ubver&s;ion of one great principle of &s;ocial &s;ecurity, to wit, that every man &s;hall be pre&s;umed innocent until he is proved guilty: This was to invert the order of things; and in&s;tead of obliging the &s;tate to prove the guilt, in order to inflict the penalty, it was to oblige the citizen to e&s;tabli&s;h his own innocence, to avoid the penalty. It was to excite &s;cruples in the hone&s;t and con&s;cientious, and to hold out a bribe to perjury.</P>
<P>THAT this was an eva&s;ion of the treaty, the fourth propo&s;ition already laid down will illu&s;trate. It was a mode of inquiry who had committed any of tho&s;e crimes to which the penalty of di&s;|qualification was annexed, with this aggravation, that it deprived the citizen of the benefit of that advantage which he would have enjoyed by leaving, as as in all other ca&s;es, the burthen of the proof upon the pro&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>To place this matter in a &s;till clearer light, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of the mode of indictment and trial by jury, the legi&s;lature was to declare that every citizen who did not &s;wear he had never adhered to the King of Great-Britain, &s;hould incur all the penalties which our trea&s;on laws pre&s;cribe. Would this not be a palpable eva&s;ion of the treaty, and a direct infringement of the con&s;titution? The principle is the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, with only this difference in the con&s;equences; that in the in&s;tance already acted upon, the citizen forfeits a part of his rights,&mdash;in the one &s;up|po&s;ed he would forfeit the whole. The degree of puni&s;hment is all that di&s;tingui&s;hes the ca&s;es. In either ju&s;tly con&s;idered, it is &s;ub&s;ti|tuting a new and arbitrary mode of pro&s;ecution to that antient and highly e&s;teemed one, recognized by the laws and the con&s;titution of the &s;tate; I mean the trial by jury.</P>
<P>LET us not forget that the con&s;titution declares that trial by jury in all ca&s;es in which it has been formerly u&s;ed, &s;hould remain in|violate forever, and that the legi&s;lature &s;hould at no time, erect any new juri&s;diction which &s;hould not proceed, according to the cour&s;e of the common law. Nothing can be more repugnant to the true genius of the common law, than &s;uch an inqui&s;ition as has been mentioned into the con&s;ciencies of men.</P>
<P>A &s;hare in the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate, which is exerci&s;ed by the citizens at large, in voting at elections is one of the mo&s;t import|ant rights of the &s;ubject, and in a republic ought to &s;tand foremo&s;t in the e&s;timation of the law. It is that right, by which we exi&s;t a free people; and it certainly therefore will never be admitted that le&s;s ceremony ought to be u&s;ed in dive&s;ting any citizen of that right, than in depriving him of his property. Such a doctrine would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uit the principles of the revolution, which taught the inhabitants
<PB N="38" REF="018367_0036_0FA6A5D47869BDF0">of this country to ri&s;k their lives and fortunes in <HI>a&s;&s;erting</HI> their <HI>liberty;</HI> or in other words, their <HI>right</HI> to a <HI>&s;hare</HI> in the govern|ment. That portion of the &s;overeignty, to which each individual is entitled, can never be too highly prized. It is that for which we have fought and bled; and we &s;hould cautiou&s;ly guard again&s;t any precedents, however they may be immediately directed again&s;t tho&s;e we hate, which may in their con&s;equences render our title to this great privilege, precarious. Here we may find the criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine from the pretended whig&mdash;The man that would attack that right, in whatever &s;hape, is an enemy to whiggi&s;m.</P>
<P>IF any oath, with retro&s;pect to pa&s;t conduct, were to be made the condition, on which individuals, who have re&s;ided within the Briti&s;h lines, &s;hould hold their e&s;tates; we &s;hould immediately &s;ee, that this proceeding would be tyrannical, and a violation of the treaty, and yet when the &s;ame mode is employed to divert that right, which ought to be deemed &s;till more &s;acred, many of us are &s;o infatuated as to overlook the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the per&s;ons, who will be affected by it, have pre|viou&s;ly forfeited that right, and that therefore nothing is taken away from them, is a begging of the que&s;tion. How do we know who are the per&s;ons in this &s;ituation? If it be an&s;wered, this is the mode taken to a&s;certain it, the objection returns, 'tis an improper mode, becaus;e it puts the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the citizen upon a wor&s;e footing, than we &s;hould be willing to tole|rate where inferior intere&s;ts were concerned; and becau&s;e to elude the treaty it &s;ub&s;titutes to the e&s;tabli&s;hed and legal mode of ive&s;ti|gating crimes, and inflicting forfeitures, one that is unknown to the con&s;titution, and repugnant to the genius of our law.</P>
<P>MUCH &s;tre&s;s has been laid upon a couple of unmeaning words in the act, to enforce the penalties of which, the oath was invent|ted. It is declared, that the per&s;ons, who have done the &s;everal things enumerated in the act, &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> di&s;qualified. The&s;e words of potent sound, but of little &s;ub&s;tance, have been &s;uppo&s;ed to include wonderful effects. Let us &s;ee if we can give them any definite meaning. If a man commits murder, by the very act <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> he incurs the penalty of death; but before he can be hanged, we mu&s;t enquire whether he has certainly com|mitted the fact. If a man has done any of tho&s;e things which are declared &s;ufficient to di&s;qualify him from voting, though by the very act, <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> he incurs the penalty of the law, yet before he can be actually di&s;qualified, we mu&s;t enquire whether he has really done the act. From this we perceive the word <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> are mere expletives, which add nothing to the force or efficacy of the law.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid too, that an oath to determine the qualificati|ons of electors, is an u&s;ual precaution in free governments; but we may challenge tho&s;e who make the a&s;&s;ertion, to &s;how that retro&s;pective oaths have ever been admini&s;tered, requiring elec|tors
<PB N="39" REF="018367_0037_0FA6A5D537782648">to &s;wear that they have not been guilty of pa&s;t offences. In all the violence of party which has at different periods agitated Great Britain, nothing of this kind has ever been adopted; but even where religious fanatici&s;m has given an edge to political op|po&s;ition, and in an undecided con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t for the crown, they have never gone further than to pre&s;cribe oaths for te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing pre&s;ent dis|po&s;itions towards the government on general principles, without retro&s;pection to particular in&s;tances of pa&s;t mal-conduct The practical notions of legal liberty e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country by a &s;eries of time would make &s;uch an experiment too odious to be attempted by the government.</P>

<P>Men, who&s;e judgements and intentions I re&s;pect, were promo|ters of the mea&s;ure, which has occa&s;ioned this digre&s;&s;ion; &s;ome from the contagion of popular opinion; others from the too &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions of momentary expedience, and a third cla&s;s from the in&s;en&s;ible bias of &s;ome <HI>favourite pur&s;uit.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fourth method in which the inhabitants of the South|ern di&s;trict may have lo&s;t their rights of citizen&s;hip, a di&s;member|ment by treaty, I have naturally been drawn, under the third head, into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this, and I tru&s;t have &s;hown to the full &s;atisfaction of all candid men, that there is not a &s;hadow of foun|dation to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a di&s;memberment, is in the contemplation of the treaty. A few &s;hort remarks &s;hall conclude what I in|terd to &s;ay on this article.</P>
<P>IT is a ca&s;e, without precedent, that a nation in &s;urrendering its acqui&s;itions in war, to the &s;tate from which tho&s;e acqui&s;itions were made, &s;hould &s;tipulate for the inhabitants of the country gi|ven up as for <HI>its own</HI> &s;ubjects. To do it would be both u&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd; u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e the country being &s;urrendered, no rea&s;onable advantage could be derived from retaining the allegi|ance of its inhabitants; ab&s;urd, becau&s;e the di&s;trict of territory &s;urrendered being given up as a part of the &s;tate, to which the &s;urrender is made, it would be contradictory, by the &s;ame act, to acknowledge the right of that &s;tate to the <HI>part</HI> given up, and yet to hold up a claim to the allegiance of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE &s;urrender (for the que&s;tion does not relate to <HI>original ce&s;&s;ions</HI>) carries in it&s;elf a deci&s;ive implication, that the inhabi|tants of the country &s;urrendered, are the &s;ubjects of the power to which the &s;urrender is made; and the pre&s;umption in this ca&s;e is &s;o &s;trong that nothing but the mo&s;t po&s;itive and unequivocal excep|tions in the treaty would be &s;ufficient to defeat it. Laboured con|&s;tructions to give the treaty that complexion are inadmi&s;&s;ible; for if there were room to doubt, the doubt, in ju&s;t rea&s;oning, &s;hould be interpreted again&s;t the po&s;ition, that the inhabitants of the
<PB N="40" REF="018367_0038_0FA6A5D5F75CAB20">country &s;urrendered were the &s;ubjects of the power by which the &s;urrender was made.</P>
<P>THE only additional remark I &s;hall make on this head is this: &mdash; Though we are under great obligations to our mini&s;ters for the &s;ub&s;tance of the treaty, which comprehends all the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of this country; we mu&s;t acknowledge that the language of it is, in many re&s;pects, defective and ob&s;cure. The true rule in this ca&s;e is, not to have recour&s;e to artificial and far-fetched interpretation; but to admit &s;uch meanings as the &s;imple and and popular import of the words conveys. When therefore it is &s;aid in the &s;ixth article. "that there &s;hall be no future pro&s;ecu|tions commenced, nor confi&s;cations made, nor damage done to per&s;on, liberty, or property, of any per&s;on or per&s;ons, on account of the part taken by them in the war," as the natural and obvi|ous &s;cope of the words pre&s;ents a full amne&s;ty and indemnity for the future; we &s;hould not torture our imaginations to pervert them to a different &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>IT has been urged, in &s;upport of the doctrines under con&s;idera|tion, that every government has a right to take precautions for its own &s;ecurity, and to pre&s;cribe the terms on which its rights &s;hall be enjoyed.</P>
<P>ALL this is true when under&s;tood with proper limitations; but when rightly under&s;tood will not be found to ju&s;tify the conclu&s;ion, which have been drawn from the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t formation of a government the &s;ociety may multiply its precautions as much, and annex as many conditions to the en|joyment of its rights, as it &s;hall judge expedient; but when it has once adopted a con&s;titution, that con&s;titution mu&s;t be the mea&s;ure of its di&s;cretion, in providing for its own &s;afety, and in pre&s;crib|ing the conditions upon which its privileges are to be enjoyed. If the con&s;titution declares that per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing certain qualifi|cations &s;hall be entitled to certain rights, while that con&s;titution remains in force, the government which is the mere creature of the con&s;titution, can dive&s;t no citizen, who has the requi&s;ite qualifi|cations, of his corre&s;ponding rights. It may indeed enact laws and annex to the breach of them the penalty of forfeiture; but before that penalty can operate, the exi&s;tence of the fact, upon which it is to take place, mo&s;t be a&s;certained in that mode which the con&s;titution and the fundamental laws have provided. If trial by jury is the mode known and e&s;tabli&s;hed by that con&s;titution and tho&s;e laws, the per&s;ons who admini&s;ter the government in de|viating from that cour&s;e will be guilty of u&s;urpation. If the con|&s;titution declares that the legi&s;lative power of the &s;tate &s;hall be ve&s;ted in one &s;et of men and the judiciary power in another; and tho&s;e who are appointed to act in a legi&s;lative capacity undertake the office of judges, if, in&s;tead of confining them&s;elves to pa&s;&s;ing laws, with proper functions to enforce their ob&s;ervance, they go out of their province to decide who are the violators of tho&s;e laws, they &s;ubvert the con&s;titution and erect a tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="018367_0039_0FA6A5D6B7B52390">
<HI>If the con&s;titution were even &s;ilent on particular points tho&s;e who are incru&s;ted with its power, would be bound in exerci&s;ing their di&s;|cretion to con&s;ult and pur&s;ue its &s;pirit, and to conform to the dictates of rea&s;on and equity; if, in&s;tead of this, they &s;hould undertake to declare whole cla&s;&s;es of citizens disfranchi&s;ed and excluded from the common rights of the &s;ociety, without hearing, trial, examination or proof; if, in&s;tead of waiting to take away the rights of citizen&s;hip from indi|viduals, till the &s;tate has convicted them of crimes, by which they are to lo&s;e them, before the ordinary and regular tribunal, they in&s;titute an inqui&s;ition into mens con&s;ciences, and oblige them to give up their privileges, or undertake to interpret the law at the hazard of perjury; they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the imputation of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>THE right of a government to pre&s;cribe the conditions on which its privileges &s;hall be enjoyed, is bounded with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are already included in the compact, by its original conditions; in admitting &s;trangers it may add new ones; but it cannot without a breach of the &s;ocial compact deprive tho&s;e, who have been once admitted of their rights, unle&s;s for &s;ome declared cau&s;e of forfeiture authenticated with the &s;olemnities required by the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting compact.</P>
<P>THE rights too of a republican government are to be modified and regulated by the principles of &s;uch a government. The&s;e principles dictate, that no man &s;hall lo&s;e his rights without a hearing and conviction, before the proper tribunal; that previ|ous to his disfranchi&s;ement, he &s;hall have the full benefit of the laws to make his defence; and that his innocence &s;hall be pre&s;umed till his guilt has been proved. The&s;e with many other maxims, never to be forgotten in any but tyrannical governments, oppo&s;e the aims of tho&s;e who quarrel with the principles of Phocion.</P>
<P>CASES indeed of extreme nece&s;&s;ity are exceptions to all general rules; but the&s;e only exi&s;t, when it is manife&s;t the &s;afety of the community is in imminent danger.

<P>WHEN the advocates for legi&s;lative di&s;criminations are driven from one &s;ubterfuge to another, their la&s;t re&s;ting place is &mdash; that this is a new ca&s;e, the ca&s;e of a revolution.

<P>AMONG the extravagancies with which the&s;e prolific times abound, we hear it often &s;aid, that the con&s;titution being the crea|ture of the people, their &s;en&s;e with re&s;pect to any mea&s;ure, if it even &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution, will &s;anctify and make it right.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, for us, in this country, the po&s;ition is not to be controverted; that the con&s;titution is the creature of the people; but it does not follow that they are not bound by it, while they &s;uffer it to continue in force; nor does it follow, that the legi&s;lature, which is, on the other hand, a creature of the con&s;titution, can depart from it, on any pre&s;umption of the contrary &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution is the compact made between the &s;ociety at large and each individual. The &s;ociety therefore, cannot without breach of faith and inju&s;tice, refu&s;e to any individual, a &s;ingle advantage which he derives under that compact, no more than one man can refu&s;e to perform his agreement with another. If the community have good rea&s;ons for abrogating the old compact, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a new one, it undoubtedly has a right to do it; but until the compact is di&s;&s;olved with the &s;ame &s;olemnity and certain|ty with which it was made, the &s;ociety, as well as individuals, are bound by it.</P>
<P>ALL the authority of the legi&s;lature is delegated to them under the con&s;titution; their rights and powers are there defined; if they exceed them, 'tis a trea&s;onable u&s;urpation upon the power and maje&s;ty of the people; and by the &s;ame rule that they may take away from a &s;ingle individual the rights he claims under the con&s;titution, they may erect them&s;elves into perpetual dictators. The &s;en&s;e of the people, if urged in ju&s;tification of the mea&s;ure, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a mere pretext; for that &s;en&s;e cannot appear
<PB N="43" REF="018367_0041_0FA6A5D99EA805C0">to them in a form &s;o explicit and authoritative, as the con&s;titu|tion under which they act: and if it could appear with equal au|thenticity, it could only bind, when it had been preceded by a declared change in the form of government.</P>
<P>THE contrary doctrine &s;erves to undermine all tho&s;e rules, by which individuals can know their duties and their rights, and to covert the government into a government of <HI>will</HI> not of <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is only one light on Mentor's plan in which the &s;ub|ject remains to be con&s;idered &mdash; the danger to the government, from &s;uffering per&s;ons to re&s;ide among us, who have an aver&s;ion to our con&s;titution; either by their becoming auxiliaries to future attempts of the Briti&s;h nation to recover their lo&s;t authority; or by their contributing to corrupt the principles and change the form of our government.</P>
<P>MY ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject, in my former letter, I believe remain un&s;haken, by what Mentor has oppo&s;ed to them. I &s;hall however add a few others.</P>
<P>THE re&s;toration of Briti&s;h authority in this country, is too chimerical to be believed even by Mentor him&s;elf; though he makes &s;ome &s;aint e&s;&s;ays to induce the &s;uppo&s;ition,</P>
<P>WHY did Great Britain make peace with America? Becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs compelled her to it. In what did this nece&s;&s;ity con&s;i&s;t? In every &s;pecies of embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;order, that a nation could experience. Her public debt had almo&s;t arriv|ed at that point, when the expences of a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment were nearly equal to all the revenues they were able to extract from exhau&s;ting the &s;ources of taxation. Had they carried on the war, 'till they had exceeded this point, a bankruptcy would have been the inevitable con&s;equence. We perceive, as it is, the great dif|ficulties that are acknowedged by every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, in devi&s;ing means to retrieve the affairs of the nation.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tractions of the government, ari&s;ing from tho&s;e embar|ra&s;&s;ments, are &s;carcely paralleled in any period of Briti&s;h hi&s;tory. Almo&s;t every &s;itting of parliament is a &s;ignal of a change of mini|&s;try. The King at variance with his mini&s;ters &mdash; the mini|&s;ters un&s;upported by parliament &mdash; the lords di&s;agreeing with the commons; the nation execrating the King, mini&s;ter, lords and commons; all the&s;e are &s;ymptoms of a vital malady in 'the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the nation,</P>
<P>EXTERNALLY the &s;cene is not brighter: The affairs of the Ea&s;t India &s;ettlements are in the mo&s;t perplexing confu&s;ion, and Ireland &s;eems to be ready to di&s;member it&s;elf from the Briti&s;h em|pire.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid that the&s;e are temporary mi&s;chiefs, which may be &s;ucceeded by greater tranquility, pro&s;perity and power. The future &s;ituation of Great Britain is a problem which the wi&s;ed man cannot &s;olve. In all appearance, it will be a con&s;iderable time, before &s;he can recover from the pre&s;&s;ure of the evils under which &s;he now labours, to be in a condition to form enterprizes again&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="018367_0042_0FA6A5D9D4982BC8">others: When that period may arrive our &s;trength and re&s;ources will have greatly increa&s;ed &mdash; the habits of men attached to her will have worn out &mdash; and it is vi&s;ionary to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he will then entertain a di&s;po&s;ition to renew her attempts upon a coun|try, increa&s;ed in &s;trength and re&s;ources, exerting its forces under an e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution, fortified by foreign alliances, which her acknowledged independence will at all times command; when &s;he reflects that that country, in the tumolt of a revolution, and in a &s;tate of comparative impotence, baffled all her efforts, in the zenith of her power.</P>
<P>To an enlightened mind it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, upon this &s;ubject, that independent of our own means of repelling enter|pri&s;es again&s;t us. Europe has been taught by this revolution to e&s;timate the danger to it&s;elf c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an union of the two countries, under the &s;ame government, in too &s;triking a manner, ever to permit the re-union, or tolerate the attempts of Great Britain towards it.</P>
<P>THE danger, from a corruption of the principles of our govern|ment, is more plau&s;ible, butr not more &s;olid &mdash; It is an axiom that governments form manners, as well as as manners form govern|ments. The body of te people of this &s;tate are too firmly mum|ber to give a different tone to that &s;pirit. The pre&s;ent law of in|heritance making an equal divi&s;ion among the children, of the pa|rents property, will &s;oon melt down tho&s;e great e&s;tates, which if they continued, might favour the power of the <HI>&s;ew.</HI> The num|ber of the di&s;affected, who are &s;o, from &s;peculative notions of go|vernment, is &s;mall: The great majority of tho&s;e, who took part again&s;t us, did it from accident, from the dread of the Briti&s;h power, and from the influence of others to whom they had been accu&s;tomed to look up. Mo&s;t of the men, who had that kind of influence are already gone: The re&s;idue and their adherents mu&s;t be carried along by the torrent; and with very few exceptions, if the government is mild and ju&s;t, will &s;oon come to view it with approbation and attachment.</P>
<P>Either the number of mal-contents in the &s;tate is &s;mall or it is con&s;iderable. If &s;mall, there can be no room for apprehensions; if great, then oppo&s;ition to the government is only to be overcome by making it their intere&s;t to be its friends, or by extirpating them from the community. A middle line which will betray a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution in the government, but will only extend its operation to a &s;mall number, will an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than to di&s;able a few, and inflame and river the prejudices of the re&s;t; by exhibiting the temper of government in a har&s;h and unconcilia|ting light. We &s;hall then in truth have a con&s;iderable faction in the &s;tate ready for all innotations.</P>
<P>THE impracticability of &s;uch a general extinpation &s;ugge&s;ts the oppo&s;ite conduct as the only proper one.</P>
<P>THERE is a bigotry in politics, as well as in religions, equally pernicious in both&mdash; The zealors, of either de&s;cription, are igno|rant
<PB N="45" REF="018367_0043_0FA6A5DA77443950">of the advantage of a &s;pirit of toleration: It was a long time before the kingdoms of Europe were convinced of the folly of per&s;ecution, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e, who were &s;chi&s;matics from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The cry was, the&s;e men will be equally the di&s;turbers of the hierarchy and of the &s;tate, While &s;ome king|doms were impoveri&s;hing and depopulating them&s;elves, by their &s;everities to the non-conformi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, their wi&s;er neighbours were reaping the fruits of their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly, and augmenting their own num|bers, indu&s;try and wealth, by receiving with open arms the per&s;e|cuted fugitives. Time and experience have taught a different le&s;&s;on; and there is not an enlightened nation, which does not now acknowledge the force of this truth, that whatever &s;peculative notions of religion may be entertained, men will not on that ac|count, be enemies to a government, that affords them protection and &s;ecurity. The &s;ame &s;pirit of toleration in politics, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, has made great progre&s;s among mankind, of which the hi&s;tory of mo&s;t modern revolutions is a proof. Unhappily for this &s;tate, there are &s;ome among us, who po&s;&s;e&s;s too much influ|ence, that have motives of personal ambition and intere&s;t to &s;hut their minds again&s;t the entrance of that moderation, which the real welfare of the community reaches.</P>
<P>Our nerghbours &s;eem to be in a di&s;po&s;ition to benefit by our mi&s;takes: and the time will not be very remote, if the &s;chemes of &s;ome men can prevail, when we &s;hall be a&s;hamed of our own blindne&s;s, and heap infamy upon its promoters.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, though not extraordinary, that tho&s;e charac|ters, throughout the &s;tates, who have been principally in&s;trumen|tal in the revolation, are the mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to per&s;ecuting mea&s;ures. Were it proper, I might trace the truth of this remark from that character, which has been the fir&s;t in con&s;picuou&s;ne&s;s, through the &s;everal gradations of tho&s;e, with very few exceptions, who either in the civil or military line have borne a di&s;tingui&s;hed part. On the other hand I might point out men who were reluctantly dragged into taking a part in the revolution; others who were furious zealots in the commencement of the di&s;pute, that were not heard of to any public purpo&s;e, during the progre&s;s of it, and others who were fluctuating, according to the tide of good or ill-fortune, all of whom now join in the cry with a third cla&s;s, more impru|dent but much more re&s;pectable, and endeavour by the loudne&s;s of their clamours to atone for their pa&s;t delinquencies.</P>
<P>As to Mentor's commercial reveries, I &s;hall decline be&s;towing many remarks upon them, not only becau&s;e they are not immedi|ately connected with the general &s;ubject, but becau&s;e there is little danger of their making <HI>any</HI> pro&s;elytes; while men are convinced that the pro&s;perity of the national commerce depends as much upon the extent of its capital as that of an individal&mdash; that to con|fine trade to any particular de&s;cription of men, in exclu&s;ion of others who have better means of carrying it on, would be, if practicable, to make the people at large tributary to the avarice of a &s;mall number, who were to have the benefit of the monopoly &mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="018367_0044_0FA6A5DB3804F910">that in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things, a very &s;mall proportion of tho&s;e, intended to be benefited, who have the means to avail them&s;elves of the advantage, would reap all its fruits even at the expence and to the prejudice of the greater part of tho&s;e who were meant to be favoured&mdash; that the fewer hands trade is confined to the le&s;s will be its activity, and the le&s;s the degree of emplovment affordes to other cla&s;&s;es of the community; and, in &s;hort, that all monopolies, exclu&s;ions and di&s;criminations, in matters of traffick, are pernicious and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>SINCE writing the foregoing, I have learned, that a bill is depending before the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, for putting various de|&s;criptions of per&s;ons out of the protection of government. I have too much re&s;pect for the wi&s;dom and virtue of that body to &s;uppo&s;e a mea&s;ure of this nature can brain the &s;anction of the majority &mdash; What is the plain language of the propo&s;al? There are certain per&s;ons, who are obnoxious to public re&s;entment. The treaty forbids us to proceed again&s;t them in a legal way. Let us therefore by an uncon&s;titutional exertion of power evade the creaty, however dangerous the precedent to the liberty of the &s;ubject, and however derogatory to the honour of the nation. By the treaty we &s;tipulate, that <HI>no per&s;on</HI> or <HI>per&s;ons</HI> &s;hall <HI>&s;uffer</HI> on account of the part they may have taken in the war, any damage to person, liberty, or property; and yet by taking away the protection of go|vernment, which they would enjoy under the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting laws, we leave them to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> whatever injury to erther, the ra&s;hne&s;s of in|dividuals who are the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of the &s;tate, may think proper to inflict. What would this be but to imitate the conduct of a cer|tain General, who having premi&s;ed that he would not &s;pill the blood of &s;ome pri&s;oners, who were about to &s;urrender by capitola|tion, after he had them in his power, had them all &s;trangled to death? Words in every contract are to be con&s;trued so as to give them a rea&s;onable effect. When it is &s;tipulated, that a man &s;hall not &s;uffer in per&s;on, liberty, or property, it does not merely mean, that the &s;tate will not inflict any po&s;itive puni&s;hment upon him; but al&s;o that it will afford him protection and &s;ecurity from injury. The very <HI>letter</HI> as well as the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the &s;tipulation imports this&mdash; He <HI>&s;hall not &s;uffer</HI> any damage, are the words of the treaty.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of putting men out of the protection of the law, is calculated to transfer the &s;cepter from the hands of government to tho&s;e of individuals &mdash; it is to arm one part of the commu|nity again&s;t another; it is to <HI>enact</HI> a civil war, If unhappily for the &s;tate, this plan could &s;ucceed, no man can fore&s;ee the end of it. But the guardians of the rights of the community will certainly, on mature deliberation reject it.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for the honour of the &s;tate, if expul&s;ions mu&s;t take place, if the con&s;titution and the faith of the United States, mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to a &s;uppo&s;ed political expedience. I had much rather &s;ee an open avowal of the principles upon which we
<PB N="47" REF="018367_0045_0FA6A5DBF75CD618">acted, than that we &s;hould cloth the de&s;ign with a vile of artifice and di&s;gui&s;e, too thin not to be penetrated by the mo&s;t ordinary eye.</P>
<P>I SHALL now with a few general reflections conclude.</P>
<P>THOSE, who are at pre&s;ent entru&s;ted with power, in all the&s;e infant republics, hold the mo&s;t &s;acred depo&s;it that ever was con|fided to human hands. 'Tis with governments as with individu|als, fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions and early habits give a la&s;ting bias to the temper and character. Our governments hitherto have no habits. How important to the happine&s;s not of America alone, but of mankind, that they &s;hould acquire good ones.</P>
<P>IF we &s;et out with ju&s;tice, moderation, liberality, and a &s;cru|pulous regard to the con&s;titution, the government will acquire a &s;pirit and tone, productive of permanent ble&s;&s;ings to the commu|nity. If on the contrary, the public councils are guided by humour, pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice; if from re&s;entment to individuals, or a dread of partial inconveniencies, the con&s;titution is &s;lighted or explained away, upon every frivolous pretext, the future &s;pirit of government will be feeble, di&s;tracted and arbitrary. The rights of the &s;ubject will be the &s;port of every party vici&s;&s;itude. There will be no &s;ettled rule of conduct, but every thing will fluctuate with the alternate prevalency of contending factions.</P>
<P>THE world has its eye upon America. The noble &s;truggle we have made in the cau&s;e of liberty, has occa&s;ioned a kind of revolution in human &s;entiment. The influence of our example has penetrated the gloomy regions of de&s;poti&s;m, and has pointed the way to inquiries, which may &s;hake it to its deepe&s;t foundations. Men begin to a&s;k every where, who is this tyrant, that dares to build his greatne&s;s on our mi&s;ery and degradation? What com|mi&s;&s;ion has he to &s;acrifice millions to the wanton appetites of him|&s;elf and the few minions that &s;urround his throne?</P>
<P>To ripen inquiry into action, it remains for us to ju&s;tify the revolution by its fruits.</P>
<P>IF the con&s;equences prove, that we really have a&s;&s;erted the cau&s;e of human happine&s;s, what may not be expected from &s;o illu&s;trious an example? &mdash; In a greater or le&s;s degree, the world will ble&s;s and imitate?</P>
<P>BUT if experience, in this in&s;tance, verifies the le&s;&s;on long taught by the enemies of liberty; &mdash; that the bulk of mankind are not fit to govern them&s;elves, that they mu&s;t have a ma&s;tter, and were only made for the rein and the &s;pur: We &s;hall then &s;ee the final triumph of de&s;poti&s;m over liberty &mdash; The advocates of the latter mu&s;t acknowledge it to be an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> and abandon the pur&s;uit. With the greate&s;t advantages for promoting it, that ever a people had, we &s;hall have betrayed the cau&s;e of human na|ture.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e in who&s;e hands it is placed, pau&s;e for a moment, and contemplate with an eye of reverence, the va&s;t tru&s;t committed to them. Let them retire into their own bo&s;oms and examine the
<PB N="48" REF="018367_0046_0FA6A5DCB8D174B8">motives which there prevail. Let them a&s;k them&s;elves this &s;olemn que&s;tion &mdash; Is the &s;acrifice of a few mi&s;taken, or criminal individuals, an object worthy of the &s;hifts to which we are reduced to evade the con&s;titution and the national engagements? Then let them review the arguments that have been offered with di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate candour; and if they even doubt the propriety of the mea|&s;ures. they may be about to adopt, let them remember, that in a doubtful ca&s;e, the con&s;titution ought never to be hazarded, with|out extreme nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
