<P>BIOGRAPHICAL memoirs of per&s;ons, famous for the great good or the great mi&s;chief they have done, are &s;o &s;ure to meet with a favourable reception in print, that it has long been &s;ubject of
<PB N="4" REF="030204_0004_0FE51038D7D009F0">
a&s;toni&s;hment, that none of the di&s;ciples of Paine &s;hould ever have thought of obliging the world with an account of his life. His being of mean birth could form no rea&s;onable objection: when the life of his hero is &s;potle&s;s, the biographer feels a pride as well as a plea&s;ure in tracing him from the penu|rious &s;hed to the pinnacle of renown. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e from whom we might have expected the hi&s;tory of Old Common Sen&s;e, are profe&s;&s;ed admirers of all that is of low and even ba&s;e extraction. They are continually boa&s;ting of the &s;uperior virtues of their "democratic floor," as they call it; it, therefore, &s;eems wonderful, that they &s;hould have neglected giving an in&s;tance of this &s;uperiority in the life of their <HI>virtuous</HI> leader.</P>
<P>This unaccountable negligence of Paine's friends has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, been compen&s;ated by the di|ligence of the friends of order and religion. His life was publi&s;hed in London, in 1793; but, like mo&s;t other works calculated to &s;tem the torrent of popu|lar prejudice, it has never found admittance into the American pre&s;s. I am afraid it will be a la&s;ting reproach on tho&s;e, into who&s;e hands this pre&s;s has fallen, that while thou&s;ands upon thou&s;ands of that bla&s;phemous work, "the Age of Rea&s;on," were &s;truck off, the in&s;tant it arrived in the country, not a &s;ingle copy of the life and crimes of the bla&s;|phemer, &s;o fit to counteract his diabolical efforts, was printed in the whole Union.</P>
<P>This little pamphlet has, at la&s;t, fallen into my hands, and were I to delay communicating it to the public, I &s;hould be unworthy of that liberty of the pre&s;s, which, in &s;pite of lying pamphlets and threat|ening

letters, I am determined to enjoy, while I have types and paper at my command.</P>
<P>The reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve that this account of Paine's Life, is an ab&s;tract of his life, a larger work, written by <HI>Francis Oldys,</HI> A. M. of the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, and publi&s;hed by Mr. Stockdale of London. The following extract is taken from the London Review of the work.&mdash;<Q>A more co|gent rea&s;on cannot be given for this publication, than that which is a&s;&s;igned by the writer of Mr. Paine's Life, in the following &s;hort exordium.&mdash; <HI>It has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the reiterated &s;uffrage of mankind, that the lives of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have either performed u&s;eful actions, or neglected e&s;&s;ential duties, ought to be recounted, as much for an exam|ple to the pre&s;ent age, as for the in&s;truction of fu|ture times.</HI>&mdash;THOMAS PAIN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>In a note we are informed by <HI>Mr. Oldys,</HI> that this is the real name; and that his fictitious name is <HI>Paine</HI> with a final <HI>e;</HI> for that his father's name was <HI>Pain;</HI> his own name was <HI>Pain</HI> when he married, when he corre&s;ponded with the ex|ci&s;e, and when he fir&s;t appeared in America. But finding &s;ome inconvenience in his real name, or &s;eeing &s;ome advan|tage in a fictitious one, he thus changed the name of his family; and he thus exerci&s;ed a freedom which <HI>the great</HI> en|joy for honourable ends.</Q></NOTE> (proceed the Reviewers) is placed preci&s;ely in this predica|ment. His actions have &s;tamped him a public character, and from his public conduct much u&s;e|ful information and in&s;truction may be derived. In his tran&s;actions as a private individual, we find the records of villainy in various &s;hapes, not impo&s;ing upon mankind under any impene|trable ma&s;k, or clo&s;e-wrought veil, but, almo&s;t from the beginning, openly and avowedly prac|ti&s;ed

in the broad face of day. The facts on which he &s;tands convicted by his Biographer are not lightly &s;tated, but are &s;upported by authentic documents and &s;ub&s;tantiated by evidence.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall detain the reader here but a moment, to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e Reviewers were, and are, the partizans of Paine, rather than otherwi&s;e; and that, in many parts of their review, they have attempted to palliate his crimes.</P>
<Q><P>The following ab&s;tract of the Life of <HI>Paine,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Oldys</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> will perhaps be accept|able to the world; as every fact in it is, by the confe&s;&s;ion of Paine him&s;elf, of his friends, and of his enemies, undeniably authentic.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That part of this e&s;&s;ay which the reader finds thus mark|ed with inverted commas, is taken from the printed copy. The re&s;t, whether good or bad, whether republican or anti-republican, I am ready to take upon my&s;elf.</NOTE></P>
<P>THOMAS PAINE was born at Thetford, in the county of Norfolk (in England), on the 29th of January, 1736-7. His father was Jo&s;eph Pain, a &s;taymaker by trade, and of the &s;ect of the Quakers. His mother, Frances Cocke, daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church.</P>
<P>By &s;ome accident, probably ari&s;ing from the di&s;agreement of his parents in their religious &s;en|timents,
<PB N="7" REF="030204_0007_0FE5108777664810">
the &s;on was never baptized. He was, however, confirmed at the u&s;ual age, by the Bi|&s;hop of Norwich, through the care of his aunt, Mi&s;tre&s;s Cocke.</P>
<P>At the free-&s;chool of Thetford, under Mr. Knowles, young Paine was in&s;tructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic. The expen&s;e of his edu|cation was defrayed by his father, with &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from his mother's relations.&mdash;At the age of thirteen, he became his father's apprentice, in the trade of a &s;taymaker. At this employment he continued for five years; although he, him&s;elf, forgetful or regardle&s;s of the truth, has, in the &s;econd part of his Rights of Man, related, that he entered, at the age of &s;ixteen, on board the <HI>Terrible</HI> privateer, Captain Death; which was not fitted out till &s;ome years afterwards.</P>
<P>He went, at the age of nineteen, to try his for|tune in London; where he worked for &s;ome time with Mr. <HI>Morris,</HI> an eminent &s;taymaker in Hano|ver-&s;treet, Long-acre.&mdash;After a very &s;hort &s;tay in this &s;ituation, he repaired to Dover; and there obtained employment with Mr. <HI>Grace,</HI> a re&s;pecta|ble &s;taymaker. While Paine remained here, an attachment began between him and Mi&s;s Grace, his ma&s;ter's daughter: in con&s;equence of which, Mr. Grace was induced to lend our adventurer ten pounds, to enable him to &s;ettle as a ma&s;ter-&s;taymaker at Sandwich.</P>
<P>He &s;ettled at Sandwich in April, 1759; but for|got to repay the ten pounds, or to fulfil the mar|riage, in expectation of which the money had
<PB N="8" REF="030204_0008_0FE5103D310A5628">
been advanced to him.&mdash;Here, it &s;eems, he took up his lodging in the market place; and formed a little congregation, to whom he preached, in his lodging, as <HI>an independent mini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, he fell in love with a pretty, mode&s;t, young woman, <HI>Mary Lambert,</HI> daughter of James Lambert; who, with his wife Mary, had come to <HI>Sittingbourne</HI> as an exci&s;eman, before the year 1736; but, having been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for mi&s;|conduct, had opened a &s;hop, and acted, be&s;ides, as bum-bailiff of Sittingbourne. Both father and mother were by this time dead, in indigent cir|cum&s;tances; and the daughter was now waiting-woman to Mrs. Solly, wife of Richard Solly, an eminent woollen-draper at Sandwich.&mdash;Mary Lambert and Thomas Paine were married on the 27th of September, 1759. Although he was on|ly twenty-two, and &s;he twenty-one years of age, yet, by the &s;cars of di&s;ea&s;e, or by the native har&s;hne&s;s of his features, he appeared at the time of the marriage &s;o much older than &s;he, that the good women of Sandwich expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hment, that <HI>&s;o fine a girl &s;hould marry &s;o old a fellow.</HI></P>
<P>Thomas, &s;oon after the marriage, finding him&s;elf &s;omehow di&s;appointed, began to maltreat his wife. Little more than two months had pa&s;&s;ed, when this became vi&s;ible to the whole town. By Mrs. Solly's aid, their poverty was occa&s;ionally relieved. From the furni&s;hed lodging in which Paine had hitherto lived, the young couple &s;oon removed to a hou&s;e, for which they, with &s;ome difficulty, obtained furniture upon credit. But he having contracted debts which he was unable to di&s;charge, our ad|venturer,
<PB N="9" REF="030204_0009_0FE5108F35A571B8">
with his wife, found them&s;elves obliged to take what is called in Scotland, a <HI>moonlight flitting;</HI> and, on the night between the &s;eventh and eighth of April, 1760, they &s;et out from Sandwich to Margate; Thomas carrying with him the furniture which he had purcha&s;ed on credit, a &s;tove belonging to his hou&s;e, and the &s;tays of a cu&s;tomer. The &s;tays were recovered from him by a timeful claim. He &s;old the furniture by auc|tion at Margate.&mdash;The &s;ale of goods obtained upon credit on a fal&s;e pretext, is a crime that was for|merly puni&s;hed by expo&s;ure on the pillory, which has &s;ince been changed for tran&s;portation.</P></Q>
<P>At this place, the reader will undoubtedly call to mind Paine's vehement &s;allies again&s;t the Engli&s;h penal code. All the <HI>patriots</HI> look upon law-givers, judges, juries, and the whole &s;uite of ju&s;tice, as their mortal enemies. "Inhuman wretches," &s;ays Tom, <Q>that are leagued together to rob Man of his Rights, and with them of his exi&s;tence.</Q> This is like the thief, who, when about to receive &s;en|tence of death, prote&s;ted he would &s;wear the peace again&s;t the judge, for that he verily believed he had a de&s;ign upon his life.&mdash;Reader, while you live &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e tender-hearted fellows who &s;hudder at the name of the gallows. When you hear a man loud again&s;t the &s;everity of the laws, &s;et him down for a rogue.</P>
<P><Q>From Margate, Paine returned to London. His wife &s;et out with him: but her &s;ub&s;equent fate is not well known. Some &s;ay that &s;he peri&s;hed on the road, by ill u&s;age and a premature birth:
<PB N="10" REF="030204_0010_0FE5104385742DE0">
others, in con&s;equence of diligent inquiry, believe her to be &s;till alive; although the ob&s;curity of her retreat prevents ready di&s;covery.</Q></P>
<P>Now, who that reads this, does not feel a de&s;ire to kick the &s;coundrel of a &s;tay-maker, for exclaim|ing again&s;t ari&s;tocracy, becau&s;e, as he pretends, its laws and cu&s;toms are cruel and unnatural?&mdash; "With what kind of parental reflections," &s;ays the hypocrite in his Rights of Man, <Q>can the fa|ther and mother contemplate their tender off|&s;pring?&mdash;To re&s;tore parents to their children, and children to their parents, relations to each other, and man to &s;ociety, the French Con&s;titu|tion has de&s;troyed the law of primogeniture&s;hip.</Q> &mdash;Is not this fine cant to entrap the un&s;u&s;pecting vulgar? Who would not imagine that the &s;oul which pours it&s;elf forth in joy for the re&s;toration of all the&s;e dear relatives to each other, was made up of con&s;tancy and tenderne&s;s? Who would &s;u&s;pect the man who&s;e benevolence is thus extended to foreign|ers, whom he never &s;aw, of being a brutal and &s;a|vage hu&s;band, and an unnatural father?&mdash;Do you a&s;k, <Q>with what kind of parental reflections the fa|ther and mother can contemplate their tender offspring?</Q>&mdash;Hypocritical mon&s;ter! with what kind of reflections did you contemplate the la&s;t agonies of a poor, weak, credulous woman, who had braved the &s;coffs of the world, who had aban|doned every thing for your &s;ake, had put her all in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and who looked up to you, and you alone, for &s;upport?</P>
<P>Paine's humanity, like that of all the reforming philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent enlightened day, is of
<PB N="11" REF="030204_0011_0FE5109206797C68">
the &s;peculative kind. It never breaks out into ac|tion. Hear the&s;e people, and you would think them overflowing with the milk of human kindne&s;s. They &s;tretch their benevolence to the extremities of the globe: it embraces every living creature&mdash;except tho&s;e who have the misfortune to come in contact with them. They are all citizens of the world: country and friends and relations are unworthy the attention of men who are occupied in rendering all mankind happy and free.</P>
<P>I ever &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of a man who&s;e di&s;|cour&s;e abounds in expre&s;&s;ions of univer&s;al philan|thropy. Nothing is ea&s;ier than for a per&s;on of &s;ome imagination to rai&s;e him&s;elf to a &s;well of &s;entiment, without the aid of one &s;ingle feeling of the heart. Rou&s;|&s;eau, for in&s;tance, is everla&s;tingly babbling about his <HI>genre humain</HI> (human race) and his <HI>"coeur aimant et tendre"</HI> (tender and loving heart). He writes for the human race, his heart bleeds for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the human race, and, in the mid&s;t of all this, he &s;ends his unfortunate ba&s;tards to the poor-hou&s;e, the receptacle of mi&s;ery! Virtuous and tender-heart|ed and &s;ympathetic Rou&s;&s;eau! Certainly nothing is &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting as this, except it be to &s;ee the humane and &s;entimental Sterne wiping away a tear at the &s;ight of a dead jack-a&s;s, while his injured wife and child were pining away their days in a nunnery, and while he was debauching the wife of his friend.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sterne's writings are mo&s;t admirably calculated to de&s;troy the morals of the youth of both &s;exes; but it was re&s;erved for &s;ome of the printers in the United States to give tho&s;e writings the fini&s;hing touch. What the lewd author was a&s;hamed to do, they have done for him. They have explained his <HI>double en|tendres</HI> and <HI>filthy inuendos</HI> by a &s;et of the mo&s;t bawdy cuts that ever di&s;graced the pencil.&mdash;I was &s;hown a copy of the <HI>Senti|mental</HI> Journey in this &s;tyle at the &s;hop of Citizen Thomas Brad|ford of Philadelphia, the only place in the city, I believe, where it is to be had.</NOTE></P>
<Q><PB N="12" REF="030204_0012_0FE51046825CEB60">
<P>In July, 1761&punc; Thomas returned, without her, to his father's hou&s;e.&mdash;Having been un&s;ucce&s;sful in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;tay-maker, he was now willing to leave it for the Exci&s;e. In the Exci&s;e, after four|teen months of &s;tudy and trials, he was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the 1&s;t of December 1762, at the age of twenty-five. The kindne&s;s of Mr. Cock&s;edge, record|er of Thetford, procured for him this appoint|ment. He was &s;ent, as a &s;upernumerary, fir&s;t to Grantham; and on the 8th of Augu&s;t 1764, to Alford.&mdash;Being detected in &s;ome mi&s;conduct, he was, on the 27th of Augu&s;t 1765, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s and di&s;grace, he repaired to London a third time. Here charity &s;upplied him with clothes, money, and lodging; till he was, on the 11th of July 1766, re&s;tored to the Exci&s;e, although not to immediate employ|ment.&mdash;For &s;upport, in the mean time, he en|gaged him&s;elf for a &s;alary of five and twenty pounds a year, in the &s;ervice of Mr. Noble; who keeping an academy in Lemon-&s;treet, Goodman's fields, wanted an u&s;her to teach Engli&s;h, and walk out with the children. He won nobody's favour in this family: and, at Chri&s;tmas, left the &s;ervice of Mr. Noble for that of Mr. Gardner, who then taught a reputable &s;chool at Ken&s;ington. With Mr. Gardner he continued only three months.&mdash;He would now willingly have taken orders; but, being only an Engli&s;h &s;cholar, could
<PB N="13" REF="030204_0013_0FE51093FAF21A68">
not obtain the certificate of his qualifications previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary. Being violently moved, however, with the &s;pirit of preaching, he wan|dered about for a while as an itinerant Methodi&s;t; and, as urged by his nece&s;&s;ities, or directed by his &s;pirit, preached in Moorfields, and in various populous places in England.</P>
<P>At length, in March 1768, he again obtained employment in his calling of an Exci&s;e-officer; and was &s;ent in this capacity, to Lewes in Su&s;|&s;ex.&mdash;He was now, at the age of thirty-one, ambitious of &s;hining as a <HI>jolly fellow</HI> among his com|panions; yet without re&s;training his &s;ullen, over|bearing temper; although to the neglect of his duty as an Exci&s;e-man. By his intrepidity in wa|ter and on ice, he gained the appellation of <HI>Com|modore.</HI> He had gone to live with Mr. Samuel Ollive, a tobacconi&s;t; and in his hou&s;e he con|tinued till that worthy man's death. Mr. Ollive died in bad circum&s;tances; leaving a widow, one daughter, and &s;everal &s;ons. For &s;ome di&s;hone&s;t intermeddling with the effects of his decea&s;ed land|lord, Paine was turned out of the hou&s;e by Mr. Atter&s;ol, the executor. But, being more favourably regarded by the widow and daughter, he was re|ceived again by them in 1770. He &s;oon after commenced grocer; opening Ollive's &s;hop in his own name. He, at the &s;ame time worked the to|bacco mill on his own behalf; and, regardle&s;s of the regulations of the Exci&s;e, and of his duty as an Exci&s;e-officer, for &s;everal years continued this trade, engaging without &s;cruple in &s;muggling prac|tices, in order to render it lucrative.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030204_0014_0FE5104809A5C1D0">In 1771, at the age of thirty-four, he again ventured on matrimony. Elizabeth Ollive, the daughter of his late landlord, whom he now mar|ried, was a hand&s;ome and worthy woman, eleven years younger than him&s;elf; and, had it not been for her unfortunate attachment to him, might have married to much greater advantage.&mdash;Upon the occa&s;ion of this &s;econd marriage, Thomas Paine thought proper to repre&s;ent him&s;elf as a batchelor, although he mu&s;t have known that he was either a widower,&mdash;or, indeed, if his former wife was then alive, a married man;&mdash;and al|though the marriage act has declared it to be felo|ny, without benefit of clergy, for a per&s;on thus wilfully to make a fal&s;e entry on the regi&s;ter.&mdash; In the &s;ame year, Paine fir&s;t commenced author. &mdash;<HI>Rumbold,</HI> candidate for New Shoreham, requir|ed a &s;ong to celebrate the patrioti&s;m and the con|viviality of the occa&s;ion. Paine produced one, which was accepted, and rewarded with three gui|neas.&mdash;His poetical honours he &s;eems to have af|terwards forgotten; for, in 1779, he a&s;&s;erted in the news-papers, that, till the appearance of his <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> he had never publi&s;hed a &s;ylla|ble.</P>
<P>By a certain boldne&s;s and bu&s;tle of character, although without the recommendation of hone&s;ty, he had become a &s;ort of chief among the Exci&s;e|men. They began about this time to be di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied, that their &s;alaries were not augmented with the increa&s;e of the national wealth, of the public revenue, and of the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Citizen Paine undertook to write their <HI>Ca&s;e;</HI> and, in 1772, produced an octavo pamphlet of one
<PB N="15" REF="030204_0015_0FE5109588E24EA8">
and twenty pages, containing an <HI>Introduction; The State of the Salary of the Officers of Exci&s;e; and Thoughts on the Corruption ari&s;ing from the Po|verty of Exci&s;e-Officers.</HI> Of this pamphlet four thou&s;and copies were printed. A contribution was made by the Exci&s;emen, to &s;upply the ex|pen&s;es attending the &s;olicitation of their ca&s;e. Paine bu&s;tled about, as their agent, in London, in the winter of 1773. But nothing was done; and al|though liberally paid by his employers, he forgot to pay his printer.</P>
<P>In his attention to the common cau&s;e of the Exci&s;emen, he had neglected his own private af|fairs. His credit failed. He &s;unk into difficulties and di&s;tre&s;s: and, in this &s;ituation, made a bill of &s;ale of his whole effects to Mr. Whitfield, a con|&s;iderable grocer at Lewes, and his principal credi|tor. Mr. Whitfield, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of pay|ment, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the premi&s;es, and, in April 1774, di&s;po&s;ed of them as his own. The other creditors, thinking them&s;elves outwitted by Whitfield, and cheated by Paine, had recour&s;e to the rigours of law. Paine &s;ought concealment for a time in the cock-loft of the Whitehor&s;e-inn.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, he was again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Exci&s;e. His carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the duties of his office&mdash;dealing as a grocer in exci&s;eable articles&mdash;buying &s;muggled tobacco, as a grinder of &s;nuff&mdash;and conniving at others for the conceal|ment of it him&s;elf&mdash;could no longer be overlooked or excu&s;ed. His di&s;mi&s;&s;ion took place on the 8th of April, 1774. He petitioned to be re&s;tored, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030204_0016_0FE5104990EC7948">Reader, how often have I ob&s;erved, that di&s;ap|pointment, and refu&s;al of favours a&s;ked from go|vernment, are the great &s;ources of what is now-a-days called patrioti&s;m? Here we are arrived at the cau&s;e of Tom Paine's mortal enmity to the Briti&s;h government. Had his humble petition been grant|ed; had he been re&s;tored to his office, he might, and undoubtedly would, have &s;tigmatized the Ame|ricans as rebels and traitors. He would have pro|bably been among the &s;upple&s;t tools of Lord North, in&s;tead of by the champion of American Inde|pendence.</P>
<P>Who, after reading this, will believe that he was actuated by laudable motives, when he wrote again&s;t taxation; when he called the exci&s;e a hell-born mon&s;ter? He long was, you &s;ee, an advocate for this hell-born mon&s;ter, and even one of its choice mini&s;ters, and &s;uch would he have been to this day, had not his <HI>petition</HI> been rejected. What, Thomas! Petition to be one of the under-devils of a hell-born mon&s;ter!</P>
<P>Whatever may be the &s;ervices which his vindic|tive pen rendered to the cau&s;e of the United States, the people of this country owe him no tribute of gratitude, any more than they do to the pretended friend&s;hip of the French court, or nation. Both had the &s;ame objects in view: the furthering of their intere&s;ts and glutting of their revenge. They looked upon the revolted coloni&s;ts as their tools, and if America profited by their interference, it was owing to the wi&s;dom of her councils, and not to their good-will.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030204_0017_0FE510A07AD98570">When patriot Tom began his career in America, it was a&s;&s;uredly very nece&s;&s;ary for him to a&s;&s;ert, that, till the appearance of his <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> he had never publi&s;hed a &s;ingle &s;yllable; for, it would have looked a little aukward to &s;ee that work coming from the pen of a di&s;carded exci&s;e officer, who had petitioned for a rein&s;tatement in his oppre&s;&s;ive of|fice. Not a whit le&s;s aukward does it now appear, to hear clamours again&s;t the expen&s;es of the Briti&s;h government coming from the very man who would willingly have added to tho&s;e expen&s;es by an aug|mentation of his own &s;alary.

Tom and that of <HI>Old John Swanwick.</HI> Both had paid off their debts in England with a &s;punge, both had been field preachers, and both had been exci&s;e officers, when the American war broke out: at this moment they &s;eparated. After having gone &s;ide by &s;ide during their whole lives, they &s;teered a cour&s;e directly oppo&s;ite to each other. Paine became a flaming patriot, while Swanwick remained a royali&s;t. &mdash;How came this? Why, Swanwick was &s;till in office, whereas poor Tom was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Had Swanwick been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and Paine in office, Tom would have followed the Briti&s;h waggons to New-York, and Swanwick would, probably, have written <HI>Common Sense.</HI></P>
<P>With the reader's permi&s;&s;ion, I will ju&s;t &s;tep a&s;ide from my &s;ubject, to a&s;k, how it happened, that Ci|tizen John Swanwick, now one of the augu&s;t re|pre&s;entatives of the city of which I have the ho|nour to be an inhabitant, came to be a &s;tanch whig, while his re&s;pectable &s;ire was as zealous a waggon|ma&s;ter as any in the Royal army? Mr. Swanwick was, I pre&s;ume, too young, at that time, to per|ceive the amazing advantage that a citizen enjoys over a &s;ubject; and, as he profe&s;&s;es a great deal of filial piety, one may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that he would have followed the fortunes of his father, had not his remaining behind been in con&s;equence of a concerted plan. This is a &s;troke of dome&s;tic policy, which has been often practi&s;ed in tickli&s;h times, but never with more complete &s;ucce&s;s than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. The father was a <HI>faithful subject</HI> and the &s;on a <HI>firm patriot;</HI> the father &s;ang <HI>God save the king</HI> and the &s;on <HI>Yankey-doodle;</HI> the fa|ther got a <HI>pen&s;ion</HI> and the &s;on a <HI>seat in Congre&s;s.</HI>&mdash;

I could continue a little further here, but it is time to return to our old broken exci&s;eman.</P>
<Q><P>Amid this knavery and mi&s;management, Paine had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by conjugal tender|ne&s;s to his &s;econd wife. He had now lived with her three years and a half, and, be&s;ides cruelly beating, had otherwi&s;e treated her, wilfully and &s;hamefully, in a manner which would excite the indignation and re&s;entment of every virtuous married woman; and which mu&s;t en&s;ure to him the dete&s;tation of every honourable man. From an attention to the known delicacy and mode&s;ty of our fair country-women, we forbear, in this ab&s;tract, to &s;tate the particulars, though they are publi&s;hed at length in Mr. Oldys's pamphlet.&mdash;The con&s;equence of all this was a &s;eparation between him and his wife, upon the conditions of her paying her hu&s;band thirty-five pounds &s;terling, and his agreeing to claim no part of whatever property &s;he might thereafter acquire.</P>
<P>Paine now retired to London; but would not leave his wife in peace till they had mutually en|tered into new articles of &s;eparation; in which it was declared on his part, that <HI>he no longer found a wife a convenience,</HI> and on hers, that <HI>&s;he had too long suffered the miseries of such a husband.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This is the kind and philanthropic Tom Paine, who &s;ets up &s;uch a piteous howl about the cruelty and tyranny of kings!&mdash;<Q>I have known many of tho&s;e bold champions for liberty in my time,</Q> &s;ays the good old Vicar of Wakefield, <Q>yet do I not
<PB N="20" REF="030204_0020_0FE51055291AB868">
remember one who was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant.</Q> What Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves of Milton may with ju&s;tice be applied to every in|dividual of the king-killing crew: <Q>he looked upon woman as made only for obedience and man only for rebellion.</Q> I would reque&s;t the reader to look round among his acquaintance, and &s;ee if this ob&s;ervation does not every where hold good; &s;ee if there be one among the yelping ken|nel of modern patriots, who is not a bad hu&s;band, father, brother, or &s;on. The &s;ame pride and turbu|lence of &s;pirit that lead them to withhold every mark of re&s;pect and obedience from their &s;uperiors, lead them al&s;o to tyrannize over tho&s;e who are &s;o unfortunate as to be &s;ubjected to their will. The laws of nature will &s;eldom, if ever, be re&s;pected by the man who has &s;et tho&s;e of his country and of decorum at defiance; and from this degree of per|ver&s;ity there is but one &s;tep to the defiance of hea|ven it&s;elf. The good citizen or &s;ubject, the good hu&s;band, parent and child, and the good chri&s;tian, exi&s;t together or they exi&s;t not at all.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tances attending Tom's &s;eparation from this la&s;t wife, we may make a pretty correct cal|culation of his value as a hu&s;band. The poor woman was obliged to pay him thirty-five pounds &s;terling to get rid of him; &s;o that, a <HI>democratic spouse,</HI> even &s;uppo&s;ing him to come up to his great leader in worth is (in Federal currency) ju&s;t one hundred and fifty-&s;ix dollars, &s;ixty-&s;ix cents and two-thirds of a cent, <HI>worse than nothing.</HI> Oh, ba&s;e democra|cy! Why, it is ab&s;olutely wor&s;e than &s;treet-&s;weep|ings, or the filth of common-&s;ewers.</P>

<Q><P>He arrived at Philadelphia in the winter of 1774, a few months before the battle of Lexington. He was fir&s;t engaged as &s;hopman, by Mr. Aitkin, a book&s;eller in Philadelphia, at the wages of twenty pounds a year. In November 1775, he was em|ployed in a laboratory. He took great pains in experiments for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covering &s;ome cheap, ea&s;y, and expeditious method of making &s;altpetre. He was al&s;o the propo&s;er of a plan for the voluntary &s;upplyiog of the public magazines with gun-powder; and earne&s;tly laboured to per|&s;uade the inhabitants of Philadelphia to adopt it.</P>
<P>On the 10th of January 1776, was publi&s;hed his <HI>Common Sense,</HI> an 8vo. pamphlet of &s;ixty-three pages. This pamphlet was eagerly read, pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal editions, and was even tran&s;lated into German. Pro&s;ecuting the career, upon which he had thus not un&s;ucce&s;sfully entered, he, on the 19th of December 1776, publi&s;hed, in the <HI>Pennsylvania Journal,</HI> the fir&s;t number of the <HI>Crisis,</HI> intended like the former work, to encour|age
<PB N="24" REF="030204_0024_0FE51059844BFDA8">
the Americans in their oppo&s;ition to the Bri|ti&s;h government.&mdash;The <HI>Crisis,</HI> he continued to publi&s;h in occa&s;ional numbers, till the 13th and la&s;t appeared on the &s;ame day on which a ce&s;&s;ati|on of ho&s;tilities between America and Britain was proclaimed at Philadelphia, the 19th of April 1783.</P></Q>
<P>Thus, we &s;ee, that he was hardly arrived in Ame|rica, when he &s;et about digging up &s;altpetre for the de&s;truction of his countrymen, the &s;ervants of that king whom he him&s;elf had &s;erved, and whom he would &s;till have &s;erved, had he not been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in di&s;grace. And can any one have the folly to be|lieve, or the impudence to &s;ay, that this man was actuated by a love of liberty and America?</P>
<P>The unprincipled, or &s;illy, admirers of Paine, when they hear their hero attacked, never fail to &s;tigmatize his enemies as enemies of the American cau&s;e. Their object in doing this is evident enough: but, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, what has the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of that cau&s;e to do with an inquiry into the actions and motives of Paine? Is a man to be looked upon as regretting that America obtained its independence, merely becau&s;e he dete&s;ts a cru|el, treacherous, and bla&s;phemous ruffian who once wrote in favour of it? Are the characters of the men who effected the &s;eparation from Britain &s;o clo&s;ely united with that of Paine, that they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall together? Are the merits of the revo|lution it&s;elf at la&s;t to be linked to all that is ba&s;e and infamous?</P>
<P>No one, not even Congre&s;s it&s;elf, ever attempted to ju&s;tify the coloni&s;ts in their revolt again&s;t their
<PB N="25" REF="030204_0025_0FE510AB42BBC888">
&s;overeign upon any other ground than this: <HI>that they were an oppressed people, unable to obtain a re|dress of their grievances, without appealing to arms.</HI> Seeing them in this light we mu&s;t be careful to ex|clude from this ju&s;tification all tho&s;e &s;ubjects of the king, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted them without having partaken of the oppre&s;&s;ion of which they complained. Among the Americans them&s;elves a difference of opinion might, and did, prevail. Some looked upon them|&s;elves as oppre&s;&s;ed, others did not; both parties were fully ju&s;tified upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they acted agreeably to their con&s;ciences: but a man like Paine, ju&s;t landed in the country, could have no oppre&s;&s;ion to complain of, and, therefore, his ho&s;|tility again&s;t his country admits of no defence. He was a traitor, as were the Prie&s;tleys, the Prices and all others of the &s;ame de&s;cription. No good man, however zealous he might be in the revoluti|on, ever re&s;pected Paine, of which the coldne&s;s and neglect he experienced, as &s;oon as order was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, is a certain proof. The faithful ci|tizen, or &s;ubject, naturally dete&s;ts a traitor: it is an impul&s;e that none of us can re&s;i&s;t: however we may differ in opinion in other re&s;pects, we all agree (to u&s;e one of Tom's own expre&s;&s;ions) that <Q>a trai|tor is the foule&s;t fiend on earth.</Q></P>
<Q><P>In 1777, he was appointed by the Congre&s;s, &s;ecretary to their committee for foreign affairs. When Silas Deane, commercial agent for the Con|gre&s;s in Europe, was recalled, to make room for William Lee once alderman of London, a con|tention en&s;ued between Deane and the family of the Lees; and Paine took part in the controver&s;y,
<PB N="26" REF="030204_0026_0FE510632A2F54E8">
by attacking Deane. He took occa&s;ion to in|volve in the di&s;pute the famous Robert Morris, financier of the United States. Morris inter|fered again&s;t him. And Paine was inadvertantly provoked to retail, through the channel of the new&s;papers, <HI>information which had been communi|cated to him in his office of secretary.</HI> This infor|mation betraying intrigues of the French court, their amba&s;&s;ador complained to Congre&s;s. Paine being interrogated, confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the author of the new&s;paper corre&s;pondence in que&s;tion, and was in con&s;equence di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office.</P></Q>
<P>What remarks I have to make here I &s;hall pre|face by an extract from Swift's excellent work, lately publi&s;hed, on the laws of Connecticut, Book V. Chap. vii. Speaking of Paine's <Q>ba&s;ene&s;s in his attack on Chri&s;tianity by publi&s;hing his <HI>Age of Rea&s;on,</HI>" Mr. Swift ob&s;erves: "this work is &s;aid to be written by Thomas Paine, <HI>Secretary for fo|reign affairs to Congre&s;s in the American War.</HI> Now, the truth is, that during &s;ome period of the American War, Congre&s;s appointed a committee for foreign affairs, to which Paine was &s;ecretary, but he had no power, and performed no duty, but that of clerk to the committee; without any portion of the authority, afterwards annexed to the office of &s;ecretary for foreign affairs. From the po&s;t of &s;ecretary to the committee for foreign affairs, he was <HI>dismissed</HI> for <HI>a scandalous breach of trust.</HI> What mu&s;t we think of a man, who is capable of &s;uch a pitiful artifice to gratify his vanity, and render him&s;elf important?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="030204_0027_0FE510B0757F7328">The&s;e are not the words of an Engli&s;hman, but of a native American, a learned and elegant writer, and a tried friend and &s;ervant of his country.</P>
<P>The account given by Mr. Swift of Tom's di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion confirms that which is given of it in his life. Both accounts, however, are &s;ilent as to the nature of the intrigues which he divulged. As I have heard this matter often &s;poken of, by my old book|&s;eller and others, I will ju&s;t repeat what I have heard, without pledging my&s;elf for the truth of it.</P>
<P>While Silas Deane was agent under the plenipo|tentiary admini&s;tration of Doctor Franklin, at the court of Ver&s;ailles; the&s;e intriguing patriots had the addre&s;s to procure a pre&s;ent of 200,000 &s;tand of <HI>condemned arms</HI> from the king of France to the Ame|rican Congre&s;s: but, as this was done at a time when the French court had &s;olemnly, though trea|cherou&s;ly, engaged not to interfere in the di&s;pute, the <HI>present</HI> was to be kept a &s;ecret among the immediate agents. The <HI>condemned</HI> arms, given <HI>as a present,</HI> were, by the <HI>faithful agents, charged</HI> as <HI>good</HI> ones, and paid for by the United States. Who pocketed the money, was then, and is &s;till a que&s;tion; but there &s;eems to have been but little doubt of its hav|ing undergone a divi&s;ion and a &s;ubdivi&s;ion, as the &s;ecret had extended far and wide, before poor Tom was &s;ilenced. I have heard more than one Ameri|can, reputed democrats, cur&s;e Dr. Franklin for having mi&s;applied the money of the country, and I imagine this mu&s;t be what they allude to. He mu&s;t certainly have found the philo&s;opher's-&s;tone, if he thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the gift of turning old iron into gold; and, as I do not &s;ee, in his will, to whom he
<PB N="28" REF="030204_0028_0FE51064B1C689D8">
bequeathed this precious &s;tone, I would thank his <HI>grand-child</HI> to inform us, in the next number of his polite and patriotic paper, who the happy mor|tal is.</P>
<P>After having heard the&s;e accounts of this di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, which all agree, let us hear what Thomas &s;ays about it him&s;elf, in the &s;econd part of his <HI>Rights of Man.</HI> <Q>After the declaration of Independence, Congre&s;s unanimou&s;ly appointed me <HI>secretary in the foreign department.</HI> But a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;ing <HI>between Congress and me,</HI> re&s;pecting one of their commi&s;&s;ioners then in Europe, Mr. Silas Deane, <HI>I re&s;igned the office.</HI></Q>&mdash;Was there ever a more pitiful attempt at acquiring reputation than this? He was in England when he wrote thus; he would not have dared to write this pa&s;&s;age in Ame|rica. He calls him&s;elf <HI>secretary in the foreign de|partment,</HI> thereby giving to under&s;tand that he was a &s;ecretary of &s;tate in America, as Lord Grenville or the Duke of Portland is in England, and as Mr. Jeffer&s;on then was in the United States. <HI>Secretary to the committee</HI> for foreign affairs would have &s;ound|ed &s;mall; it would have made a jingle like that of half-pence, whereas <HI>secretary of state</HI> rang in the ears of his empty-headed di&s;ciples, like guineas upon a hollow counter.</P>
<P><Q>But a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;ing <HI>between Congress and me.</HI></Q> Here is another fetch at importance. "Between Congre&s;s and me!" How the London Corre&s;ponding Society and affiliated mobs &s;tared at this, I dare &s;ay. If his mi&s;conduct ever became a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion before Congre&s;s, that was all. A complaint was lodged again&s;t him, and Congre&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="030204_0029_0FE510B24C4B52D8">
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; but his offence was expo&s;ing what &s;hould have been kept &s;ecret, in writing for the Lees again&s;t Silas Deane. How does he twi&s;t this into a mi&s;under&s;tanding between Congre&s;s and him? As well may the criminal &s;ay, he has had a mi&s;under|&s;tanding with the judge who condemns him.</P>
<P>"And &s;o I <HI>resigned the office.</HI>" Mr. Swift &s;ays, and every one in America knows, that he was <Q>dis|missed <HI>for a</HI> scandalous breach of trust;</Q> but this would not have been &s;o convenient for the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e infamous combinations of men who had undertaken to &s;pread his works about the three kingdoms. In the courtier's vocabulary, <HI>resigned</HI> has long been &s;ynonymous with <HI>dismissed, discarded,</HI> and <HI>turned out,</HI> and we &s;ee that Thomas, though he rails again&s;t courts and courtiers, did not &s;cruple to employ it in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>But there was another rea&s;on for &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>resign|ed</HI> for <HI>turned out.</HI> He had every rea&s;on to believe that his <HI>life</HI> would be publi&s;hed, and he wi&s;ely fore|&s;aw, that his having been <HI>turned out</HI> of the exci&s;e, and again turned out in America, would &s;tagger the faith of &s;ome of his pro&s;elytes. To be <HI>turned out</HI> by a monarchical government, and afterwards by a republican one, would have been a pretty convinc|ing proof, that he was friendly to no government whatever. I &s;incerely believe that he hated, and that he &s;till hates, the general government of the United States (as at pre&s;ent happily e&s;tabli&s;hed), as much as the government of Great Britain. But it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould find out &s;omething to hold up to the imitation of the Engli&s;h; no matter what, &s;o as it differed from what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

Being obliged, therefore, to make this u&s;e of the American government, he was the more anxious to hide the truth with re&s;pect to his <HI>dismission;</HI> for how awkward would it have looked, at the end of his pompous encomiums on the government of Ameri|ca, to add: <HI>this was the government that turned me out?</HI></P>
<Q><P>In Augu&s;t 1782, Thomas Paine publi&s;hed a con|trover&s;ial letter to the Abb&egrave; Raynal, in con&s;e|quence of the latter author's publication of his hi&s;tory of the <HI>Revolution of America.</HI> Ab&s;urd as were the general principles which Paine had ad|vanced in his <HI>Common Sense,</HI> Raynal being in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;omething to &s;ay on the occa|&s;ion, had adopted &s;ome of them. Pain reclaimed what was his own, and controverted much of the re&s;t that the Abb&egrave; &s;aid.&mdash;His next production was a letter to the Earl of Shelburne, on the effects likely to ari&s;e to Great Britain from the acknow|ledged independence of America.</P>
<P>His labours had not yet received any &s;ub&s;tantial reward. He, in the mean time, &s;uffered all the mi&s;eries of penury. He now &s;olicited the Ameri|can A&s;&s;emblies to grant &s;ome recompen&s;e for the &s;ervices by which he had contributed to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of their independence. New York be|&s;towed on him lands of little value at New Ro|chelle; Penn&s;ylvania granted him five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>In the autumn of 1786, he departed for France, after having, at New York, &s;educed a young wo|man of a reputable family. In the beginning of
<PB N="31" REF="030204_0031_0FE510B3D4F19668">
the year 1787, he arrived in Paris, and exhibited before the French academy of &s;ciences, the mo|del of a bridge of peculiar con&s;truction.</P>
<P>On the 3d of September, in this &s;ame year, Thomas Paine arrived at the <HI>White Bear</HI> in Picca|dilly, London, after an ab&s;ence of thirteen years from Britain.&mdash;His old friends recollected him; although he might have been better &s;atisfied to have been forgotten by &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Before the end of 1787, he publi&s;hed a pam|phlet, intituled <HI>Prospects on the Rubicon,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;In the year 1788, he was bu&s;y at Rotherham, in York|&s;hire, about the ca&s;ting of an iron arch for the bridge of which he had pre&s;ented a model to the French academy. This bridge proved merely an expen&s;ive project, by which the contriver was impoveri&s;hed, and the community not benefited. At Rotherham, his familiarities became di&s;agreea|ble to the women.</P>
<P>Through various circum&s;tances, Paine became indebted to White&s;ide, the American merchant, whom he had employed to receive his remittances, and to furni&s;h his expen&s;es, in the &s;um of &s;ix hun|dred and twenty pounds. Upon the bankruptcy of White&s;ide, Paine was arre&s;ted by order of the a&s;&s;ignees, at the White Bear, Piccadilly, on the 29th of October 1789. He remained for three weeks, confined in a &s;punging-hou&s;e, till he was at length relieved by the kind interference of two eminent American merchants, Me&s;&s;rs. Clagget and Murdock.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="030204_0032_0FE51067C7122288">Meanwhile, Paine had, during his involuntary retirement, li&s;tened eagerly to the news of the ri&s;ing commotions in France. Soon after he was &s;et at liberty, therefore, he cro&s;&s;ed the channel, in order to be a nearer &s;pectator of events in which he rejoiced. He returned to England about the time of the publication of Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French revolution. His next work was an an&s;wer to Mr. Burke, in the fir&s;t part of his <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>This work was publi&s;hed on the 13th of March 1791, by a Mr. Jordan in Fleet&s;treet. Con&s;cious of the &s;editious fal&s;ehoods which he had advanced in it, Paine dreaded even then the inquiries of the King's me&s;&s;engers, and &s;ought concealment in the hou&s;e of his friend, Mr. Brand Hollis; while it was indu&s;triou&s;ly given out by tho&s;e in his &s;ecret, that he had ha&s;tily departed for Paris.</P>
<P>The work which cau&s;ed the&s;e fears, was per|fectly of that ca&s;t, by which &s;uperficial read|ers and thinkers are mo&s;t readily affected; gro&s;sly invective, frequently quibbling, confounding ge|nerals with particulars, and particulars with ge|nerals, audaciou&s;ly bold, and &s;peaking the lan|guage of prevalent prejudices. It was, be&s;ides, warmly recommended to the people by a <HI>Soci|ety,</HI> who took the denomination of <HI>Constitutional.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of May, after having thus labour|ed to enlighten or confound the Briti&s;h nation, Paine returned to Paris. While <HI>sojourning</HI> there, he entered into a controver&s;y with Emanuel Syeyes,
<PB N="33" REF="030204_0033_0FE510C0C48C7D60">
who had been chiefly active in framing the new con&s;titution of France; Syeyes in defence of that limited monarchy which the new con&s;ti|tution had e&s;tabli&s;hed; Paine, <HI>against the whole hell of monarchy,</HI>&mdash;to u&s;e his own words. This controver&s;y was &s;oon dropped.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July 1791, Paine again arrived at the White Bear in Piccadilly, ju&s;t in time to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the celebration of the anniver&s;ary of the French Revolution. He did not, however, ap|pear at the public dinner on the following day. But he joined the celebrators about eight o'clock in the evening; when the people, enraged to &s;ee them brave the laws, and exult in events unfriend|ly to the happine&s;s of Britain, had a&s;&s;embled tumultuou&s;ly, to drive them away from the Crown and Anchor tavern, the place of their meeting. Mortified at finding tho&s;e ho&s;tile to them, whom they had hoped to &s;educe to become the in&s;tru|ments of their turbulence, our republicans pub|li&s;hed, on the 20th of Augu&s;t 1791, from the thatched hou&s;e tavern, a <HI>seditious declaration,</HI> the writing of Paine, which obliged the inn-keeper to forbid them his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After the&s;e tran&s;actions, Paine was preparing to vi&s;it Ireland, in the character of an apo&s;tle of Democracy, when he learned that the Iri&s;h were already &s;o well acquainted with his <HI>real character,</HI> that he might probably meet with an unfavourable reception. On this news, he retired in di&s;gu&s;t, to Greenwich.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="030204_0034_0FE510728ED1BF38">On the 4th of November 1791, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted, on the eve of the gun powder plot, at the accu&s;tom|ed commemoration of the 5th of November, by the Revolution Society. He was thanked for his <HI>Rights of Man;</HI> and gave for his toa&s;t, the <HI>Revo|lution of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after this, preparing to bring forth the <HI>Second Part</HI> of his <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> he hid him|&s;elf in FETTER-LANE. None knew where he was concealed, except Mr. Horne&mdash;Tooke, who&s;e friendly care corrected the inaccuracies of his &s;tyle, and Mr. Chapman, who was employed to print his book. At Mr. Chapman's table he oc|ca&s;ionally &s;pent a plea&s;ant evening, after the &s;oli|tary labours of the day. After this commodious in|tercour&s;e had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal months, Paine was &s;omehow moved to in&s;ult Mr. Chapman's wife;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chapman's te&s;timony on oath; Paine's trial.</NOTE> in con&s;equence of which the printer turned him out of doors with indignation; exclaiming that he had <HI>no more principle than a po&s;t, and no more religion than a ruffian.</HI></P>
<P>Paine has a&s;cribed a different origin to this quarrel with his printer: but, it is proper that even in &s;o &s;mall a matter the truth &s;hould be known. A fal&s;e tale was held out to the public, as is &s;tated at length in Mr. Oldys's pamphlet; and that part of the work which had been rejected by Mr. Chap|man was transferred to a Mr. Crowther.</P>
<P>This <HI>Second Part</HI> was at length printed and pub|li&s;hed: being recommended by the &s;ame qualities
<PB N="35" REF="030204_0035_0FE510C2C7AEB0A8">
as the <HI>First,</HI> it met with a &s;imilar reception. Its au|thor, finding that he had now excited again&s;t him|&s;elf the &s;tronge&s;t abhorrence of all the worthier part of the nation, thought it prudent to retire to France. In the mean time he printed a letter to Mr. Secretary Dundas, and another to Lord On|&s;low, the ab&s;urd &s;currility of which, might be &s;up|po&s;ed matchle&s;s; were it not that the &s;ame author has &s;ince exceeded it in an <HI>Address to the Address|ers</HI> upon his Maje&s;ty's proclamation for the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;editious writings,&mdash;and in a <HI>Letter to the National Convention of France.</HI></P>
<P>His actions and writings, however little credit they may have done him in Britain, recommended him to a &s;eat in the French Convention.</P>
<P>It would be difficult for him to find any other a&s;&s;embly in the world in which he would be not le&s;s re&s;pectable than mo&s;t of the leaders. To what i&s;&s;ue this la&s;t preferment of his may lead, it is not ea&s;y to predict. But, from the complexion of &s;ome of the late &s;ittings of the Convention, it &s;eems extremely probable that his career may fi|ni&s;h with that mi&s;erable end to which providence generally permits the machinations of &s;uch men to conduct them at la&s;t.</P>
<P>For the publication of tho&s;e writings, the ten|dency of which is avowedly &s;editious, and of which there has been too much u&s;e made towards the di&s;turbing of the dome&s;tic tranquillity of the Bri|ti&s;h empire&mdash;our author has, &s;ince his retreat into France, been indicted at the in&s;tance of the king, as u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es; tried at Guildhall, before
<PB N="36" REF="030204_0036_0FE510745FD3C808">
Lord Kenyon; and found guilty by a very re|&s;pectable jury, as the Author and publi&s;her of a book, called "Second Part of the Rights of Man, containing many fal&s;e, wicked, &s;candalous, ma|licious, and &s;editious a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add, that book&s;ellers and other venders of Paine's works mu&s;t &s;ee, by this <HI>Verdict,</HI> that the laws of their country, if dili|gently enforced, are ready to puni&s;h them for &s;o di&s;hone&s;t a <HI>Traffic.</HI></P>
<P>The reader of this plain, candid narrative, may judge for him&s;elf, whether Paine be a friend to Great Britain, or a man who&s;e conduct he would choo&s;e to imitate, or who&s;e advice he would fol|low in ordinary ca&s;es; and what reliance can be placed on the facts which he has boldly a&s;&s;erted as the ground work of mo&s;t of his wild theories.</P></Q>
<P>Here ends the account of Paine's life, as I find it in print, and which, as I formerly ob&s;erved, was publi&s;hed about the beginning of 1793. I &s;hall now attempt a continuation of it down to the pre&s;ent time, dwelling on &s;uch parts only of his conduct as will admit of no di&s;pute re&s;pecting facts.</P>
<P>Thomas's having merited death, or, at lea&s;t, tran&s;|portation in England, was a &s;trong recommendation to him in France, who&s;e newly enlightened inha|bitants &s;eem to have conceived a wonderful partial|ity for all that's vile. Several of the departments di&s;puted with each other the <HI>honour</HI> of having a <HI>convict</HI> for their repre&s;entative; a thing not &s;o much to be wondered at, when we recollect, that their
<PB N="37" REF="030204_0037_0FE510C451EA8858">
wi&s;e rulers declared, by a decree, that the galley-&s;laves were all mo&s;t excellent patriots, and that the hangman's was a po&s;t of honour.</P>
<P>The exact time of Tom's flight to this country of liberty and virtue is not mentioned, I believe, in the above account; but I recollect hearing his ar|rival talked of in the month of June, 1792. I had been on a trip from St. Omer's to Dunkirk, and on my return, I fir&s;t heard the news announced to a pretty numerous company in the canal &s;tage. <Q>Voi|l&aacute; (&s;ays an old monk, who had been driven from his cell by the &s;ans-culottes, and who was now look|ing over the gazette) "Voil&aacute; ce coquin de Paine qui nous arrive de l'Angleterre."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Why, that ra&s;cal Paine is ju&s;t arrived from England."</NOTE>&mdash;"Ah, mon Dieu</Q> (exclaimed a well-dre&s;&s;ed woman who was &s;itting be&s;ide me) <Q>Ah, la pauvre France! Tous les &s;celerats de tous les p&auml;ys de l'univers vont &s;'a&s;&s;em|bler chez nous.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ah, my God! Ah, poor France! All the &s;coundrels from all the countries in the univer&s;e are flocking among&s;t us.</Q></NOTE> The ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;erva|tion &s;truck me at the time, and has often occurred to my memory &s;ince. Indeed, every man of infa|mous character, every felon and every traitor, be|gan, at the time I am now &s;peaking of, to look up|on France as his home; and this circum&s;tance, better than any other, marks the true character of the revolution. The property of the nation was laid pro&s;trate, and the&s;e villains were a&s;&s;embling round it, as birds of prey hover over an expiring carca&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="030204_0038_0FE51075E7077098">Whether Paine was really in France, or not, in June 1792, is immaterial: it is certain that he took his &s;eat among that gang of bloodthir&s;ty tyrants, u&s;ually called the <HI>Convention,</HI> ju&s;t time enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pro&s;cribing that Con&s;titution which he had written two whole books in defence of, and in conferring every epithet of ridicule and reproach on the Con|&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, whom he had a few months be|fore extolled, as <Q>the mo&s;t augu&s;t, illuminated and illuminating body of men on earth.</Q> It was now that the Engli&s;h reformers and the democrats of America would have blu&s;hed, had not their fronts been covered with bull-hide, for the pompous eulo|giums they had heaped on the author of the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t job that Tom was &s;et about, after the de&s;truction of the Con&s;titution, was, making ano|ther. This was a thing of cour&s;e, for there is no &s;uch thing as living without con&s;titutions now-a-days. Thomas and his fellow journeymen, Bri&s;&s;ot, Cla|vi&egrave;re and about half a dozen others, fell to work, and, in a very few days, hammered out the clum&s;y, ill-proportioned devil of a thing, commonly called the Con&s;titution of 1793. Of this ridiculous in|&s;trument I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, after being cried up by the American New&s;papers, as the ma&s;ter|piece of legi&s;lative wi&s;dom, it was rejected with every mark of contempt, even by the French them|&s;elves. What is too ab&s;urd for them to &s;wallow mu&s;t be ab&s;urd indeed!</P>
<P>About the time that this con&s;titution work was going on, the unfortunate king was brought to trial by his ten times perjured and rebellious &s;ubjects.
<PB N="39" REF="030204_0039_0FE510C5D93BD2D8">
Paine did not vote for his death, a circum&s;tance that his friends produce as a proof of his ju&s;tice and humanity, forgetting at the &s;ame time, that they thereby brand all tho&s;e who did vote for it, with inju&s;tice and barbarity. However, upon clo&s;er in|quiry, we &s;hall find little rea&s;on for di&s;tinctions be|tween Tom and his colleagues. He voted for the king's <HI>bani&s;hment,</HI> the bani&s;hment of a man perfect|ly innocent, and it was owing merely to his being embarked with the faction of Bri&s;&s;ot, in&s;tead of that of Danton, that he did not vote for his death. Bri&s;&s;ot afterwards publi&s;hed, in the name of his whole party, the rea&s;ons why they looked on it as <HI>good policy</HI> not to put the king to death; on the&s;e rea&s;ons was the vote of Paine founded, and not on his humanity or his ju&s;tice. Petion, the infamous Petion de Ville-neuve, did not vote for the king's death; yet certainly no one will believe that mo|tives of ju&s;tice or humanity re&s;trained the man, who, after having plotted the in&s;urrection of the tenth of Augu&s;t, brought it again&s;t the king as a crime, and who loaded the royal captives and their children with every in&s;ult and cruelty that the heart of an up&s;tart &s;avage tyrant could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The whole proce&s;s of the trial of the king of France, from the beginning to the end, was the mo&s;t flagrant act of inju&s;tice that ever &s;tained the annals of the world. It was well known to every one, and particularly to the audacious regicides them&s;elves, that he was innocent of every crime laid to his charge. The &s;entence of bani&s;hment was therefore as unju&s;t as that of death. Inju&s;tice is ever inju&s;tice: it may exi&s;t in different degrees, but it can never change its nature. Had Paine been
<PB N="40" REF="030204_0040_0FE596A0ADAC0828">
a ju&s;t and humane man, he would have &s;tood up boldly in the defence of innocence, in place of &s;hel|tering him&s;elf under a vote for <HI>bani&s;hment.</HI> Ba|ni&s;hment! Great God! Bani&s;hment on the head of the towering family of Bourbon, pronounced by a di&s;carded Engli&s;h Exci&s;eman!&mdash;What mu&s;t have been the feelings of this for&s;aken prince, who was once called the great and good ally of America, when he heard the word <HI>bani&s;hment!</HI> come from the lips of a wretch rai&s;ed to notice by the &s;ucce&s;s of a revolution of which he him&s;elf had been a princi|pal &s;upport!&mdash;I hope no &s;uch thought came athwart the mind of the unfortunate Louis; if it did, cer|tain I am it mu&s;t have been ten million times more poignant than the pangs of death.</P>
<P>However Paine might find it convenient to vote upon this occa&s;ion, it is certain he did not feel much horror at the murder of the benefactor of his <Q>be|loved America,</Q> or he would not have remained with, and in the &s;ervice of, his murderers. He was told this by his quondam friend Mr. King, in a letter &s;ent him from England &s;oon afterwards. <Q><HI>If the French kill their king, it will be a signal for my departure, for I will not abide among such sangui|nary men.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e, Mr. Paine, were your words at our la&s;t meeting; yet, after this, you are not only with them, but the chief modeller of their new con&s;titution, formed &s;o heterogeneous and incon&s;i&s;tent, &s;o hypothetical and contradictory, as &s;hows me, that provided your theories obtain fame, you are indifferent how the people may be di&s;appointed in the practice of them.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter ought to be &s;tuck upon every wall and every po&s;t in the United States, and in every other country where the voice of the people is of any con&s;equence. It is the creed, the <HI>multum in parvo,</HI> of all the pretended patriots that ever infe&s;ted the earth. It is all in all; it is conclu&s;ive, and requires neither colouring nor commentary.</P>
<P>After the death of the king of France, there was a long &s;truggle between the faction of Bri&s;&s;ot, to which Tom had attached him&s;elf, and that of Dan|ton, Robe&s;pierre and Marat. The la&s;t named mur|derer was di&s;patched by a murdere&s;s of Bri&s;&s;ot's faction, after which her abettors were all guillotin|ed, impri&s;oned, or pro&s;cribed. Thomas &s;aved his life by countenancing the degradation of the Chri&s;|tian religion, in his "Age of Rea&s;on."</P>

<P>Danton made a calculation of Tom's head and talents, ju&s;t as a farmer makes a calculation of the labour, carca&s;s, hide and offal of a bullock; and he found that he would fetch more living than dead. By writing again&s;t religion, he might do his cau&s;e &s;ome &s;ervice, and there was little or no danger to be apprehended from him; becau&s;e, being an En|gli&s;hman, it was only giving him that name, and he could any when have him killed and dre&s;&s;ed, <HI>&agrave; la mode de Paris,</HI> at five minutes warning.</P>

a day be &s;olemnly &s;et apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth placed on the <HI>di|vine law,</HI> the <HI>word of God.</HI></Q>&mdash;In another place he &s;pends whole pages in endeavouring to per&s;uade his readers that monarchy is di&s;approved of by God, and he brings his proofs from Holy Writ, conclud|ing with the&s;e words. <Q>The&s;e portions of the <HI>Ho|ly Scriptures</HI> are direct and po&s;itive. <HI>They admit of no equivocal construction.</HI></Q>&mdash;In one part of the &s;ame writings he complains of the <HI>"impiety"</HI> of the Tories, and in another of <Q>the <HI>unchristian</HI> peevi&s;hne&s;s of the Quakers.</Q> He calls upon the people to turn out in the name of God. <Q>Say not," adds he, "that thou&s;ands are gone out, turn out your tens of thou&s;ands; throw not the burthen of the day upon <HI>Providence,</HI> but <HI>"&s;how your faith by your works,"</HI> that God may ble&s;s you.</Q></P>

<P>From Paine's <HI>Common Sense</HI> and his <HI>Age of Reason</HI> we may perceive how his opinion differed concern|ing the Americans at the two epochs of his writing. When he wrote the former, he looked upon them as a con&s;cientious and pious people; but when he wrote
<PB N="45" REF="030204_0045_0FE510D3F91A7C08">
the latter, he certainly looked upon them in the oppo&s;ite light, or he never would have ventured to addre&s;s the work to them. The fact is, he had al|tered his opinion of them upon the &s;trength of what he &s;aw in the greate&s;t part of the public papers. Af|ter &s;eeing a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel abu&s;ed, for hav|ing boldly a&s;&s;erted the truth of its doctrines, in op|po&s;ition to the horrid decrees of the French Con|vention; after having &s;een the name of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> placed in a li&s;t of famous democrats, along with the names of <HI>Paine</HI> and <HI>Marat,</HI> it was no wonder if he thought that his manual of bla&s;phemy would be an acceptable pre&s;ent to his "beloved Americans."</P>
<P>Indeed, there is but too much rea&s;on to fear, that the <HI>Age of Rea&s;on</HI> being tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, ap|parently for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of being publi&s;hed here, its being dedicated to the citizens of the Unit|ed States, together with the uncommon pains that have been taken to propagate it and the abu&s;e that has been heaped upon all tho&s;e who have attempted to counteract its effects, will do but little credit to the national character, in the opinions of tho&s;e foreigners who are not well acquainted with it. Every effort &s;hould, therefore, be exerted to convince the world, that all men of &s;en&s;e and worth in America agree in their abhorrence of the work and its malignant author. From this per&s;ua&s;ion it was, that I in&s;ert|ed in the <HI>Political Cen&s;or for May,</HI> an extract from Judge Ru&s;h's pious addre&s;s to the grand jury at Reading, and that I now honour the pre&s;ent <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> with an extract from Mr. Swift's Sy&s;tem of Laws of Connecticut, a work that every one &s;hould read, and that every one who reads mu&s;t admire.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="030204_0046_0FE510831E4E1650"><Q>To prohibit (&s;ays this learned and elegant writer) To prohibit the open, public, and expli|cit denial of the popular religion of a country, is a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to pre&s;erve the tranquillity of a government. Of this no per&s;on in a chri&s;ti|an country can complain; for, admitting him to be an infidel, he mu&s;t acknowledge, that no be|nefit can be derived from the &s;ubver&s;ion of a reli|gion which enforces the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of morality, and inculcates the divine doctrine of doing ju&s;t|ly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God. In this view of the &s;ubject, we cannot &s;ufficiently reprobate the ba&s;ene&s;s of Thomas Paine, in his attack on chri&s;tianity, by publi&s;hing his Age of Rea&s;on. While <HI>experiencing in a prison,</HI> the <HI>fruits of his vi&s;ionary theories of government,</HI> he under|takes to di&s;turb the world by his religious opini|ons. He has the impudence and effrontery to addre&s;s to the citizens of the United States of America, a paltry performance, which is intend|ed to &s;hake their faith in the religion of their fa|thers; a religion, which, while it inculcates the practice of moral virtue, contributes to &s;mooth the thorny road of this life, by opening the pro&s;|pect of a future and better: and all this he does, not to make them happier, or to introduce a bet|ter religion, but to embitter their days by the cheerle&s;s and dreary vi&s;ions of unbelief. No language can de&s;cribe the wickedne&s;s of the man, who will attempt to &s;ubvert a religion which is a &s;ource of comfort and con&s;olation to its votaries, merely for the &s;ake of eradicating all &s;entiments of religion.</Q></P>

him! I think I &s;ee him now, by his old-fa&s;hioned fire-&s;ide, reading the letter to his neighbours." "Ay, Ay," &s;ays he, <Q><HI>Will</HI> will &s;tand his ground wherever he goes.</Q>&mdash;And &s;o I will, father, in &s;pite of all the hell of democracy.</P>
<P>When I had the honour to &s;erve King George, I was elated enough at the putting on of my wor&s;ted &s;houlder-knot, and, afterwards, my &s;ilver-laced coat; what mu&s;t my feelings be then, upon &s;eeing half a dozen authors, all <HI>Doctors</HI> or the devil knows what, writing about me at one time, and ten times that number of printers, book-binders, and book|&s;ellers, bu&s;tling, running and flying about in all di|rections, to announce my fame to the impatient pub|lic? What mu&s;t I feel upon &s;eeing the news-papers filled from top to bottom, and the windows and cor|ners of the hoofes placarded, with, a <HI>Blue Shop for Pe|ter Porcupine,</HI> a <HI>Pill for Peter Porcupine, Peter Porcu|pine detected,</HI> a <HI>Roa&s;ter for Peter Porcupine,</HI> a <HI>Hi&s;tory of Peter Porcupine,</HI> a <HI>Picture of Peter Porcupine?</HI> The public will certainly excu&s;e me, if after all this, I &s;hould begin to think my&s;elf a per&s;on of &s;ome importance.</P>
<P>It is true, my heroic adver&s;aries do all &s;et out with telling their readers, that I am a contemptible wretch <HI>not worth notice.</HI> They &s;hould have &s;aid, not worth the notice <HI>of any hone&s;t man,</HI> and, as they would all naturally have excluded them&s;elves by &s;uch an addition, they would have pre&s;erved con|&s;i&s;tency at lea&s;t: but, to &s;it down hammering their brains for a fortnight or three weeks, and at la&s;t publi&s;h each of them a pamphlet about me and my performances, and then tell the public that <HI>I am not worth notice,</HI> is &s;uch a gro&s;s in&s;ult to common &s;en&s;e

<P>At the very moment that I am writing, the&s;e &s;or|ry fellows are hugging them&s;elves in the thought that they have &s;ilenced me, <HI>cut me up,</HI> as they call it.

<HEAD>"THE IMPOSTOR DETECTED."</HEAD>
<P>This pamphlet ought, on every account, to come la&s;t: we have &s;een the re&s;t ri&s;ing above each other progre&s;&s;ively; this of <HI>Bradford's</HI> crowns the whole, caps the climax of fal&s;ehood and villainy.</P>
<P>The former part of it bears the a&s;&s;umed name of <HI>Tickletoby,</HI> the latter, that of <HI>Samuel F. Bradford.</HI> It is evident, however, that both are by the &s;ame author; who he is, is not of much con&s;equence: it is clear that he acted under the directions of Bradford, and Bradford mu&s;t and &s;hall an&s;wer for the whole.</P>
<P>What every one recoils at the bare idea of, is Bradford's writing a pamphlet <HI>again&s;t the works</HI> of Peter Porcupine. Had he confined his attack to my private character and opinions, he would not have
<PB N="62" REF="030204_0061_0FE510F5C9BE85A8">
&s;o completely expo&s;ed him&s;elf; but this, I &s;uppo&s;e, his author would not con&s;ent to; I do not know any other way of accounting for his conduct.</P>
<P>Every one perceives that the letter which Brad|ford in&s;erts in <HI>Tickletoby's</HI> part of the pamphlet, is nothing but a poor and vain attempt to pre&s;erve con|&s;i&s;tency. However, to leave no room for di&s;pute on this &s;core, and to convict the &s;huffling Bradford on his own words, I am willing to allow him to be neuter with re&s;pect to <HI>Tickletoby's</HI> part, and will take him up on the contents of the letter which he &s;igns. <Q>That I have made u&s;e," &s;ays he, "of the Briti&s;h Corporal for a good purpo&s;e, I have little doubt &mdash;<HI>Dirty water</HI> will quench fire.</Q></P>
<P>Of his <HI>making u&s;e</HI> of me I &s;hall &s;peak by-and-by; at pre&s;ent I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the <HI>dirty water,</HI> which is the name he gives my writings.&mdash;Now, how will he reconcile this with his zeal to &s;pread them abroad, and with the awkward flattery he and his family u&s;ed to bore my ears with? Had I be|lieved the half of what they told me, I &s;hould have long ago expired in an extacy of &s;elf-conceit. When the Ob&s;ervations on Prie&s;tley's Emigration were publi&s;hed, Bradford and his wife took great care to inform me of the prai&s;es be&s;towed on them by &s;everal gentlemen, <HI>Doctor Green</HI> in particular, and to point out to me the pa&s;&s;ages that gave the mo&s;t plea&s;ure. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Bone to Gnaw gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, they told me: it was read in all com|panies, by the young and by the old; and I remem|ber that the &s;ons told me, on this occa&s;ion, how delighted their uncle, the late worthy Attorney Ge|neral, was with it; and that he &s;aid he &s;hould have
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">

that it was not for the &s;ake of the <HI>profit</HI> but the <HI>honour</HI> of publi&s;hing my works, that made him &s;o anxious to continue.&mdash;My wife was pre&s;ent at this interview, and can, with me, make oath to the truth of what I have here a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Nay, if my works were <HI>dirty water,</HI> why did he threaten to pro&s;ecute me for <HI>not continuing them?</HI> Dirty water is not a thing to go to law about. Did ever any body hear of a man's pro&s;ecuting another, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to bring him dirty water to throw on the public?</P>
<P>After all this prai&s;ing and flattering and menacing, my poor labours are good for nothing. The writ|ings which had given &s;o much plea&s;ure to Doctor Green, that the Attorney General would have loved me for ever for, that charmed all &s;exes and all ages, that made grave Senators &s;hake their &s;ides with laughter, and Congre&s;s-men want to treat and hug me; that were &s;o highly approved of by the officers of government, that it was an <HI>honour</HI> to publi&s;h, and that I was threatened with a pro&s;ecution for not continuing; the&s;e writings are now become <HI>dirty water!</HI>&mdash;Say rather, <HI>sour grapes.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, do the Bradfords the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that they very candidly told me, that every body could perceive a falling off, <HI>after the Congre&s;s Gallery.</HI> How &s;ingular it was, that I &s;hould begin to &s;ink the in&s;tant I quitted them! Was this be|cau&s;e they did no longer <HI>amend my works</HI> for me, or becau&s;e they no longer pocketed the ca&s;h they pro|duced! The Bradfords are book&s;ellers died in grain.

Heaven is with them worth nothing, unle&s;s they can get &s;omething by it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the motives that gave ri&s;e to my pamphlets, I have already &s;tated them, and as to their literary merit, though I have no very great opinion of it, yet, after having heard them a&s;cribed to Mr. Bond, Mr. Thornton (not the <HI>language maker</HI> but the &s;ecretary to the Engli&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador), Dr. Andrews, The Rev. Mr. Bi&s;&s;et, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Sedgewick, Dr. Smith, and, in &s;hort, to almo&s;t every gentleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents among the friends of the Federal Government, it would be mere gri|mace for me to pretend, that they have no merit at all. It is &s;omething &s;ingular, that the democrats never pitched upon any low fellow as the author; their &s;u&s;|picions always alighted among gentlemen of family and gentlemen of learning. It is therefore too late to decry my performances as ta&s;tele&s;s and illiterate, now it is di&s;covered that the author was brought up at the plough tail, and was a few years ago, a pri|vate &s;oldier in the Briti&s;h army.</P>
<P>To return to my friend Bradford. Though I am ready to admit him as a neutral in all that is &s;aid by <HI>Tickletoby,</HI> I cannot do this with regard to what is u&s;hered into the world as the performance of <HI>Samuel F. Bradford.</HI> This <HI>hatter-turned-printer,</HI> this &s;ooty-fi&s;ted &s;on of ink and urine, who&s;e heart is as black and as foul as the liquid in which he dabbles, mu&s;t have written, if he did write, at the &s;pecial in&s;tance and reque&s;t of his father; for, the Lampblack &s;ays, "a father's wi&s;h is a law with me."</P>
<P>After having premi&s;ed this, making Bradford re|&s;pon&s;ible for what is contained in his letter and his
<PB N="66" REF="030204_0064_0FE51103366E7A90">
&s;on's, I &s;hall proceed to remark on &s;uch parts of both as I think worth my notice.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t on the grand di&s;covery of the letter to the <HI>Aurora-Man.</HI>&mdash;This is a letter which I wrote to the gazette, under the &s;ignature of A Corre&s;pond|ent, again&s;t the &s;econd part of the Bone to Gnaw. The letter, as now printed by Bradford, may, for ought I know, be a very correct copy. I remem|ber the time and all the circum&s;tances well. Brad|ford, who is as eager to get money into his hands as he is unwilling to let it out again, repeatedly a&s;ked me for a <HI>Puff</HI> to this pamphlet. This very &s;on came to me for it as many as half a dozen times. I at la&s;t complied; not that I was unwilling to do it at fir&s;t (for I had bored the cunning grand-child of the cunning almanack-maker &s;everal times before), but I could with difficulty &s;pare time to write it.</P>
<P><HI>Puffs</HI> are of &s;everal &s;orts. I believe the one now before us, is what is called a <HI>Puff indirect,</HI> which means, a piece written by an author, or by his de|&s;ire, again&s;t his own performances, thereby to ex|cite oppo&s;ition, awaken the attention of the public, and &s;o advance the renown or &s;ale of his labours. <HI>A Puff indirect</HI> is, then, what I &s;tand accu&s;ed of, and as I have no argument at hand to prove the moral fitne&s;s of the thing, I mu&s;t, as pleaders do in all knotty points, appeal to precedents. My authorities are very high, being no other than Ad|di&s;on, Phillips and Pope.</P>
<P>No one that has read the Spectator (and who has not done that) can have failed to ob&s;erve, that he publi&s;hed many letters again&s;t his own writings, imi|tating
<PB N="67" REF="030204_0065_0FE5113895AE3390">
the &s;tyle and manner of his adver&s;aries, and containing weak arguments, which he immediately overturns in his an&s;wer.&mdash;Doctor John&s;on tells us that, before the acting of PHILLIPS'S <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother,</HI> a whole Spectator was devoted to its prai&s;e, and on the fir&s;t night a &s;elect audience was called to|gether to applaud it. The Epilogue to this play was written by Addi&s;on, who in&s;erted a letter again&s;t it in the Spectator, for the &s;ake of giving it a trium|phant an&s;wer. But, Pope's famous puff is a ca&s;e exactly in point. "He drew a compari&s;on," &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, <Q>of Phillips's performance with his own, in which, with an unexampled and une|qualled artifice of irony, though he has him&s;elf always the advantage, he gives the preference to Phillips. The de&s;ign of aggrandizing him&s;elf he di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;uch dexterity, that, though Addi|&s;on di&s;covered it, Steele was deceived, and was afraid of di&s;plea&s;ing Pope by publi&s;hing his paper.</Q> &mdash;Now, what cen&s;ure does Lord Chief-Ju&s;tice, John&s;on (who, God knows, was far from being over lenient) pa&s;s on all this? None at all. He calls neither of the&s;e authors <HI>"an Impo&s;tor;"</HI> nor can I think he would have done &s;o, had their puffs been written <HI>at his reque&s;t,</HI> and for <HI>his benefit.</HI></P>
<P>If a puff can ever be con&s;trued as an act of mean|ne&s;s, it mu&s;t be, when its motive is &s;elf-intere&s;t. This cannot be attributed to me, as I could get no|thing by promoting the &s;ale of the work. I had a note of hand for it in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which the num|ber of copies &s;old could not augment the value of.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="030204_0066_0FE5110513D51E30">What impudence mu&s;t a man be ble&s;&s;ed with, who can u&s;her to the world a puff, which he wi&s;hes &s;hould be looked upon as &s;omething horridly vil|lainous, when he him&s;elf reque&s;ted it to be written, tran&s;cribed it him&s;elf, and carried it him&s;elf for pub|lication?&mdash;But here the Bradfords play a double game. "It was not I <HI>transcribed</HI> it," &s;ays old Goo&s;y Tom; and "a <HI>father's wi&s;h</HI> is a law with me," returns the young Go&s;ling. But you hi&s;&s;ing, web|footed animals, is it not between you?&mdash;The puffing for fame belongs to me; but the tran&s;cribing and carrying to the pre&s;s; all the intere&s;ted part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, all the dirty work, lies among your&s;elves, and &s;o I leave you to waddle and dabble about in it.</P>
<P>Having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the <HI>Puff,</HI> we now come to the <HI>breach of confidence</HI> in publi&s;hing it. There are ma|ny tran&s;actions which we do not look upon as crimi|nal, which, neverthele&s;s, we do not wi&s;h to have made public. A lady, in love with a hand&s;ome young fellow, may make indirect advances, by the aid of a third per&s;on. This is certainly no crime; but &s;hould the confident pre&s;erve one of her letters, and afterwards publi&s;h it, I pre&s;ume &s;uch confident would meet with general dete&s;tation. This is a pa|rallel ca&s;e &s;o far; but when to this we add the aggra|vating circum&s;tance of the confident being the ori|ginal advi&s;er of the corre&s;pondence, we are at a lo&s;s for words to expre&s;s our abhorrence. Yet we mu&s;t go &s;till further with re&s;pect to Bradford. He has not only divulged what was communicated to him under his pledged &s;ecrecy, and at his pre&s;&s;ing reque&s;t, to &s;erve him; but he has been guilty of this
<PB N="69" REF="030204_0067_0FE5113CD0825180">
&s;candalous breach of confidence towards a man, to whom he owes, perhaps, that he is not now in jail for debt.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to perceive what drove him to this act of treachery. Revenge for the &s;tatement I had publi&s;hed concerning the <HI>one &s;hilling and seven-pence half-penny</HI> pamphlet. He could not help fearing that people would re&s;ent this by avoiding his &s;hop. He was right enough; for, though I am an Engli&s;hman, and of cour&s;e, a &s;ort of lawful prey to the democrats, yet they, even they, cannot help &s;aying that he is an abominable &s;harper. To be re|venged on me for this, he publi&s;hed the letter, and has thus done what all impotent vindictive men do, injured him&s;elf without injuring his adver&s;ary. I hinted that he had taken me in, and in return he betrays me to the reputation of a &s;harper, he adds that of a villain.</P>
<P>After this will any one &s;ay that I am to blame, if I expo&s;e this &s;tupid, this mean, this &s;habby, this treacherous family? Do they de&s;erve any quarter from me?&mdash;Every one &s;ays&mdash;no, Peter, no.</P>
<P>They &s;ay I lived in a garret when fir&s;t they knew me. They found me &s;ole tenant and occupier of a very good hou&s;e, No. 81, Callowhill. They &s;ay I was poor; and that lump of walking tallow &s;treaked with lampblack, that calls it&s;elf <HI>Samuel F.

With &s;uch an income I leave the reader to gue&s;s whether I had any occa&s;ion to go &s;habbily dre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;It would look childi&s;h to retort here, but let the reader go and a&s;k the women in Callowhill &s;treet about the rent in old Bradford's yellow breeches.</P>
<P>The Bradfords have &s;een others attack me upon my &s;udden <HI>exaltation,</HI> as they call it: upon my having a book-&s;hop, and all this without any vi&s;ible means of acquiring it; whence they wi&s;h to make people believe that I am paid by the Briti&s;h government. It is exce&s;&s;ively ba&s;e in the Bradfords to endeavour to &s;trengthen this opinion, becau&s;e they know that I came by my money fairly and hone&s;tly. They were never out of my debt, from the moment they publi&s;hed the fir&s;t pamphlet, which was in Aug. 1794, till the latter end of May la&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time they owed me 18 dollars, which had been due for near &s;ix months, and which I was at la&s;t obliged to <HI>take out in books.</HI></NOTE> They u&s;ed to put off the payment of their notes from time to time, and they always had at their tongues end; "we know you don't want money."

<P>It is hinted, and indeed &s;aid, in this vile pamphlet, that I have been encouraged by the American go|vernment al&s;o.&mdash;I promi&s;ed the reader I would tell him a &s;tory about Bradford's patrioti&s;m, and I will now

<P>Sooty Sam, the Go&s;ling, tells the public that I u&s;ed to call him a <HI>sans-culotte</HI> and his father a <HI>rebel.</HI> If this be true, I am &s;ure I can call them nothing wor&s;e, and therefore I am by no means anxious to contradict him.&mdash;But, pray, wi&s;e Mi&s;ter Bradford of the "political [and <HI>bawdy</HI>] book-&s;tore," is not this avowal of yours rather calculated to de&s;troy what you &s;ay about my being <HI>an artful and subtle hypocrite?</HI> I take it, that my calling you <HI>rebels</HI> and <HI>sans-culottes</HI> to you faces is no proof of my hypo|cri&s;y; nor will the public think it any proof of your

He dunned my ears about it half a dozen times; and even went &s;o far as to reque&s;t me to make inquiries about it, when I wrote home.&mdash;It was on this mo&s;t ludicrous occa&s;ion, that I bur&s;t out, <Q>Ah, d&mdash;n you, I &s;ee you are all <HI>Aristocrats</HI> and <HI>Royalists</HI> in your hearts yet. Your republicani&s;m is nothing but hypocri&s;y.</Q> And I dare &s;ay the reader will think I was half right.&mdash;I wonder what are the armorial &s;igns of Bradford's family. The cre&s;t mu&s;t be a <HI>Goose,</HI> of cour&s;e. In&s;tead of &s;col|lops and gueules, he may take a couple of printers balls, a keg of lampblack and a jordon. His two great bears of &s;ons (I except William) may &s;erve as &s;upporters, and his motto may be, <Q>One shilling and seven-pence half-penny for a pamphlet.</Q> All this will form a pretty good republican coat of arms.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered here too, that my calling the Bradfords <HI>Aristocrats</HI> and hypocrites, does not prove me to be a <HI>hypocrite,</HI> a <HI>needy hireling,</HI> or a <HI>coward.</HI> As to this la&s;t term which young Lamp|black has conferred on me, it is the blu&s;tering noi&s;e of a poor timid trembling cock, crowing upon his own dunghil. I hurl his <HI>coward</HI> back to his teeth, with the addition of <HI>fool</HI> and <HI>&s;coundrel.</HI> I think that is intere&s;t enough for one fortnight. The father has &s;erved the &s;illy &s;on, as the monkey &s;erved the cat,

<P>They accu&s;e me of being given to <HI>scandal.</HI>&mdash;If I had publi&s;hed, or made u&s;e of, one hundredth part of the anecdotes they &s;upplied me with. I &s;hould have &s;et the whole city together by the ears. The govern|or's &s;hare alone would fill a volume.&mdash;I'll ju&s;t men|tion one or two, which will prove, that I am not the fir&s;t old acquaintance that Bradford has betray|ed.&mdash;He told me of a judge, who, when he pre|&s;ented him an old account, refu&s;ed to pay it, as it was <HI>setting a bad example.</HI>&mdash;<Q>Ah, righteous judge? A Second Daniel!</Q>&mdash;He told me, that he went once to breakfa&s;t with Mr. Dallas, now Secretary of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, and that Dallas &s;aid to him: <Q>By G&mdash;d Tom we have <HI>no sugar,</HI> and I have not a farthing in the world.</Q>&mdash;"So," &s;ays my Lord Bradford, <Q>I put my hand in my pocket, and to&s;&s;ed the girl a <HI>quarter of a dollar,</HI> and &s;he went out and got &s;ome.</Q>&mdash;Another time, he &s;aid, Mr. Dallas's hair-dre&s;&s;er was going to &s;ue him for a few &s;hillings, when he, like a generous friend, &s;tepped in and put a &s;top to further proceedings, by <HI>buying the debt</HI> at a <HI>great discount.</HI>&mdash;I forget whether he &s;ays he was repaid, or not.</P>
<P>The&s;e anecdotes he wanted me to make u&s;e of; but the&s;e, as well as all the others he furni&s;hed me with, appeared to me to be brought forth by private malice, and therefore I never made u&s;e of any of them. Though, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, in one in|&s;tance in particular, this was a very great act of &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="030204_0073_0FE5114B63FEB4D8">From Secretaries of State, Judges and Govern|ors, let us come to Pre&s;idents.&mdash;Don't &s;tart read|er, my book&s;eller knew nothing again&s;t General Wa&s;hington, or he would have told it.&mdash;No; we are now going to &s;ee a trait of Bradford's republicani&s;m of another kind.&mdash;<HI>Marten's Law of Nations,</HI> a work that I tran&s;lated from the French for Bradford, is dedicated, <HI>by him,</HI> to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. The dedication was written by me, not|with&s;tanding the Bradfords were obliged to <HI>amend</HI> my writings. When a proof of it was taken off, old Bradford propo&s;ed a ful&s;ome addition to it; "give the old boy <HI>a little more oil,</HI>" &s;aid he. This grea&s;ing I refu&s;ed to have any hand in, and notwith|&s;tanding I did not <HI>know how to write,</HI> and was a <HI>needy hireling,</HI> my Lord and Ma&s;ter, Bradford, did not think proper to make any alteration, though I could have no rea&s;onable objection, as it was &s;ign|ed with his name.</P>
<P>While the old man was attempting to wheedle the Pre&s;ident and the officers of the Federal Govern|ment, the &s;on, <HI>Samuel,</HI> was wheedling the French Mini&s;ter: the Bradfords love a double game dear|ly. He &s;pent whole evenings with him, or at lea&s;t he told me &s;o. According to his account they were like two brothers. I cannot blame Mr. Adet, who undoubtedly mu&s;t have a curio&s;ity to know all the &s;ecrets of Bradford's pre&s;s. For my part, as &s;oon as I heard of this intimacy, I looked upon my|&s;elf as being as well known to the French Mini&s;ter as I was to Bradford.</P>
<P>But, there is a tale connected with this, which mu&s;t be told, becau&s;e it will give the lie to all that
<PB N="76" REF="030204_0074_0FE51115398C50A8">
young Lampblack has &s;aid about correcting and altering my works. His de&s;ign is to make peo|ple believe that I was obliged to &s;ubmit to his prun|ings. We &s;hall &s;ee how this was in a moment.&mdash; In the New Year's Gift, &s;peaking of the French Mini&s;ter, I make u&s;e of the following words: <Q>not that I doubt his veracity, though his not being a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> might be a trifling objection, with &s;ome weak minded people.</Q>&mdash;The old Goo&s;y want|ed me to change the word <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> for <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> as he was a good friend, and might be u&s;eful to his &s;on. He came him&s;elf with the proof &s;heet, to pre|vail on me to do this; but if the reader looks into the New Year's Gift, he will &s;ee that I did not yield.</P>
<P>Bradford never prevailed on me to leave out a &s;ingle word in his life, except a pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Con|gre&s;s Gallery.</HI> <Q>Remember" (&s;ays the &s;on in a triumphant manner) "Remember what was era&s;ed from the <HI>Congre&s;s Gallery.</HI></Q>&mdash;I do remem|ber it, thou compo&s;t of die-&s;tuff, lampblack and urine, I do remember it well; and &s;ince you have not told all about it, I will.&mdash;The pa&s;&s;age era&s;ed contained &s;ome remarks on the indecent and every way unbecoming expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Lewis, on the trial of Randall, when he &s;aid, that gentlemen would have &s;erved <HI>his client</HI> right, if they had <HI>kicked him out of the room.</HI> Bradford told me he had a <HI>very particular reason</HI> for wi&s;hing this left out, and as it was not a pa&s;&s;age to which I attached much importance, left out it was: but, had I known that his <HI>very particular reason</HI> was, that he had engaged Mr. Lewis as his coun&s;ellor in a &s;uit which he had ju&s;t then commenced again&s;t his decea&s;ed brother's widow and his own &s;i&s;ters, the pa&s;&s;age &s;hould not
<PB N="77" REF="030204_0075_0FE5114D10B55030">
have been left out, for him nor for Mr. Lewis nei|ther. I fear no lawyers.&mdash;From this fact we may form a pretty correct idea of the <HI>independence</HI> of Bradford's pre&s;s, when left to his own conducting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bradford pretends to detect me in a lie about my having <HI>a pre&s;s.</HI> I have two now at work for me, and the printers are always paid the in&s;tant their work is done. Can a Bradford &s;ay as much?&mdash;He tells me &s;omething about my being <HI>obliged</HI> to pay my taxes. To be &s;ure I am; but did any tax-gatherer ever dare clap his hand on any of my goods or chattels? No; but the land of Thomas Bradford; back-land which he got out of the old &s;oldiers, who were fighting la&s;t war while he was a &s;ort of jailer; this land was &s;old la&s;t year <HI>by the Sheriff,</HI> and that to pay the <HI>taxes too.</HI>&mdash;You &s;ee&punc; My Lord Bradford, that you have refre&s;hed my memory to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>I think, the further we go the deeper My Lord Bradford gets in the mire. Let us &s;top the career, then. Let us di&s;mi&s;s him, his &s;ons, his pre&s;s and his &s;hop, with a remark or two on one more pa&s;&s;age of his &s;on's letter. <Q>You, (meaning me) can declaim and <HI>scandalize</HI> with the greate&s;t hero of <HI>Bilingsgate,</HI> yet, in &s;ober argument and <HI>cha&s;tity</HI> of manner, you are a mere <HI>nincompoop.</HI></Q>&mdash;The reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that Boileau, Ro&s;com|mon and Pope, in their po&euml;tical rules, always con|vey the precept in an example; &s;o we &s;ee here, that young lampblack gives us an example of the very manner he decries.&mdash;But, a word more about <HI>chastity:</HI> not quite in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, though not &s;o far from it as to render the tran&s;ition very abrupt.&mdash; <HI>Chastity</HI> from the pen of a Bradford! <HI>Chastity,</HI> I &s;ay, from No. 8, South Front Street! <HI>Chastity</HI> from the <HI>bawdy-book-&s;hop!</HI>&mdash;I have no preten&s;ion to an over&s;tock of mode&s;ty or &s;queami&s;hne&s;s. I have &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in the army; yet have I
<PB N="78" REF="030204_0076_0FE51116C7C21968">
often been &s;hocked to &s;ee what the Bradfords &s;ell. Not, perhaps, &s;o much at the ob&s;cenity of the books, as at the conduct of the venders. I do not know a traffic &s;o completely infamous as this. In London it is confined to the very &s;cum of the Jews. It is ten times wor&s;e than the trade of a bawd: it is pimping for the eyes: it <HI>creates</HI> what the punk does but &s;atisfy when created. The&s;e <HI>literary panders</HI> are the purveyors for the bawdy-hou&s;e.&mdash;However, as far as relates to the people in que&s;tion, the &s;ons are not to blame: <Q>a <HI>father's wi&s;h</HI> is a law with them.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that though Brad|ford's publication was principally intended to do away the charge of having duped me in the one and &s;even pence half-penny job, he has left it ju&s;t as it was. His &s;on, has, indeed, attempted to bewilder the reader by a compari&s;on between the prices of the en&s;uing pamphlets; but what has this to do with the matter? His father took the <HI>Observations,</HI> was to pub|li&s;h them, and give me half the profits. Long after, many months after, every copy of the work was &s;old, I a&s;ked him for an account of it, which he brought me in <HI>writing,</HI> and in which my half of the profits was &s;tated at <HI>one shilling and seven pence half-penny,</HI> or, about <HI>twenty-one cents.</HI>&mdash;Now, nothing po&s;terior to this could po&s;&s;ibly dimini&s;h the barefa|cedne&s;s of the tran&s;action. I did not actually re|ceive the <HI>twenty-one cents;</HI> I threw the paper from me with di&s;dain; nor did I ever receive a farthing for the publication in que&s;tion from that day to this.</P>
<P>I now take leave of the Bradfords, and of all tho&s;e who have written again&s;t me. People's opini|ons
<PB N="79" REF="030204_0077_0FE5114E97363ED8">
mu&s;t now be made up concerning them and me. Tho&s;e who &s;till believe the lies that have been vomited forth again&s;t me are either too &s;tupid or too perver&s;e to merit further attention. I will, therefore, never write another word in reply to any thing that is publi&s;hed about my&s;elf. Bark away, hell-hounds, till you are &s;uffocated in your own foam. Your la|bours are pre&s;erved, bound up together in a piece of bear-&s;kin, with the hair on, and nailed up to a po&s;t in my &s;hop, where whoever plea&s;es may read them gratis.</P>
