<HEAD>INFANT BAPTISM vindicated, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time &s;ince, a &s;mall pamphlet was publi&s;hed, bear|ing the title of, <HI>Conferences on bapti&s;m.</HI> In an&s;wer to this, another has been publi&s;hed, entitled, <HI>Remarks on a late</HI> WRITER <HI>on bapti&s;m, by</HI> SAND NILES. To evade the arguments for infant bapti&s;m, contained in the fir&s;t publicati|on, Mr. N, as others have been, was obliged to deny, That the covenant of grace was ever made with mankind, and that circumci&s;ion was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the covenant, between God and his people;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Remarks, p. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e, if admitted, would form an in&s;uperable argument for infant bapti&s;m. This reduces the controver&s;y to this &s;ingle point: If God has not in&s;tituted the covenant of grace, and does not tran&s;act with mankind in it, the bapti&s;m of infants is an human invention, and they who inculcate it, <HI>teach for doctrine the commandments of men;</HI> but if God has in&s;tituted it, they who deny it, reject an ordinance of God, and neglect a u&s;eful part of chri&s;tian practice. This &s;hews the importance of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As it may a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader in under&s;tanding the pre&s;ent de|&s;ign, I will hazard a general conjecture concerning Mr. N's ideas on the&s;e &s;ubjects: if it be not accurately ju&s;t, the error will be pardonable, as he has not explicitly conveyed them.</P>
<P>Mr. N. &s;uppo&s;es, if I under&s;tand him, That in the cove|nant with Abraham, God promi&s;ed and &s;ecured the land of Canaan, with many temporal favours, for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to his &s;eed. In connection with this, he in&s;tituted many religious rites, which were typical of Chri&s;t and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. When, therefore, the po&s;terity of Abraham inherited the pro|mi&s;ed land, and Chri&s;t, who was eminently the &s;een promi&s;ed, came and completed the work of redemption, the covenant
<PB N="4" REF="021898_0003_0FB5EC0501CF8BF8">with Abraham was fulfilled&mdash;the end of tho&s;e religious in&s;ti|tutions attained, and that whole di&s;pen&s;ation di&s;annulled.&mdash;Con&s;equently, no vi&s;ible covenant &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and his people, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; nor are bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, &s;eals of any federal tran&s;action between them; but duties, in common with others, which believers are to perform, in obedience to the commands of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Others con&s;ider the covenant with Abraham, as being the covenant of grace, and a perpetual in&s;titution to the people of God; in which they tran&s;act with him, in a vi&s;ible and pub|lic manner; and divine ordinances, as confirming tokens or &s;eals of this tran&s;action. This expre&s;&s;es the difference, and introduces the propo&s;ed &s;ubject, which is, To explain or define the covenant of grace.</P>
<P>That di&s;tinct and clear ideas of this &s;ubject may be obtain|ed, it &s;hould be premi&s;ed, That covenants &s;uppo&s;e parties, im|ply conditions, and are adapted to the end de&s;igned by them. It may be further ob&s;erved, That the &s;criptures &s;peak of two covenants, without giving either of them any di&s;tingui&s;hing name or title. One of the&s;e, was eternally made between the father and the &s;on: the other &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and his people. To prevent confu&s;ion of thought and language,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Either not attending to this di&s;tinction, or not admitting it, appears to be the &s;ource of the confu&s;ion and ab&s;urdity, &s;o apparent in Mr. N's de&s;cription of covenants, p. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> the former has been denominated, <HI>The covenant of redemption:</HI> having been concerted between the Father and the Son, with re&s;pect to the redemption of the human race. In this, accor|ding to our conception, the Father, viewing the human race as fallen, propo&s;ed the incarnation and death of the Son, as the way and means of their recovery. To induce him to a com|pliance, he <HI>et before him,</HI> in connection with that dazzling glory which this would reflect on the divine character and government, the honour and <HI>joy,</HI> of redeeming an inconceiva|ble number of mi&s;erable &s;inners, from wrath and hell, and exalting them to a &s;tate of dignity and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in his hea|venly kingdom. The&s;e appeared to the Son &s;o important,
<PB N="5" REF="021898_0004_0FB5EC07E023B4F8">glorious and de&s;irable, that for the &s;ake of obtaining them, he cheerfully con&s;ented, <HI>humbled him&s;elf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the</HI> CROSS. The other has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between God and men, and been termed, <HI>The covenant of grace;</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the covenant of works, made with man in his innocent &s;tate: and expre&s;s the infinite conde&s;cen|&s;ion and grace of God, in forming it, and receiving man into it, and the important and valuable ble&s;&s;ings, he <HI>graciou&s;ly</HI> be|&s;tows upon him in it. To explain and under&s;tand this, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, That God made a covenant with man, at lea&s;t implicitly, in his primitive &s;tate: promi&s;ing him the continuance of his favour, and everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in his pre&s;ence, as the con&s;equence and reward of perfect obedience to his commands; but threatned to puni&s;h di&s;obedience with eternal death. By violating this covenant, he &s;ecluded him|&s;elf and his race, from all divine favours, upon the ba&s;is of law and de&s;ert, incurred the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and involved him&s;elf and his po&s;terity in an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery. In this &s;tate of horror and de&s;pair, God intimated to him, his gracious pur|po&s;e of redeeming and &s;aving him through the interpo&s;ition of a mediator. He then propo&s;ed a <HI>new</HI> covenant, in which per&s;onal merit was excluded, and the atonement of Chri&s;t was the ba&s;is of his favour and acceptance. He promi&s;ed pardon and eternal life, as acts of meer grace, to all true believers in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The pro&s;ecution of this <HI>glorious device of &s;a|ving &s;inners through a mediator, in the external application and u&s;e of wi&s;ely adopted means and mercies, is the</HI> DISPENSATION, <HI>and the promi&s;e of eternal life to believers in him, is</HI> THE COVE|NANT OF GRACE. For a &s;eries of ages, God treated with mankind upon this covenant, externally acquainting them with it, by the mini&s;try of holy men, to whom he revealed it, and by whom he invited them into it; but he tran&s;acted it, with tho&s;e who complied with the terms of it only &s;piritually and per&s;onally, without pre&s;cribing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters">ition of it, or affixing any vi&s;ible and public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> it. But in proce&s;s of time, he ordained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> public in&s;titution, and tran&s;acted with mankind in it, by &s;en&s;ible &s;igns and to|kens, ratifying it by known and e&s;tabli&s;hed rites.&mdash;Concern|ing this we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="021898_0005_0FB5EC101A3E4AD0">
I. The parties, God and men.</P>
<P>If it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the exceeding guiltine&s;s of man, pro|hibits all federal connection, between him and his God,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. N. is very confident in denying, That the covenant of grace could have been made with Abraham. To demon&s;trate the impo&s;&s;ibility of it, he has expre&s;&s;ed the ingredients of a covenant, and having compared the ability of Abraham with them, inferred, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, that the covenant of grace could have been made with him.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, p. 5, 'The following things are nece&s;&s;arily included in a covenant.' For the &s;ake of brevity, I make no remarks on the three fir&s;t, though ju&s;tly obnoxious to cen&s;ure, and examine only the two la&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Merit on both &s;ides'&mdash;&s;o where there is no merit, no worth or ex|cellency, as he appears to explain merit, there can be no covenant, con&s;equently there can be no covenant between beings totally depraved. But this article implies, that a covenant may &s;ub&s;i&s;t between parties, if there be merit on both &s;ides. God is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite worth: Abra|ham is a partaker of God's image, the &s;um of all excellency, therefore God and Abraham may be parties in the &s;ame covenant. Yet he &s;ays, 'Abraham nor any of his po&s;terity, can ever boa&s;t of this, becau&s;e by the fall, he lo&s;t all the excellency there ever was in man, in this happy &s;tate.' But I cannot comprehend, how Abraham and his po&s;terity, who were born totally depraved, <HI>fell</HI> and <HI>lo&s;t</HI> their excellency. That they fell and lo&s;t all the excellence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ever was in man, in his happy &s;tate, when Adam fell and lo&s;t it, two thou&s;and years before they were born, has really &s;o much of the my&s;terious in it, I &s;hall not attempt to explain it.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. And la&s;tly, neither party ought to be under prior obligations re&s;|pecting the conditions of the covenant; but Abraham was never free from being under the &s;tronge&s;t obligation,</Q> that is, to love and honour God, 'and therefore, could not po&s;&s;ibly be a party in the covenant.' Ac|cording to this, per&s;ons cannot be parties in a covenant, who are under previous obligations to each other. If, therefore, pious per&s;ons are under obligations to love and delight in one another, before they covenant toge|ther, they cannot be parties in a covenant, or enter into church &s;tate. If angels are obliged to honour and love one another, they cannot tran&s;act in a covenant together: and if the father and &s;on, as di&s;tinct per&s;onalities in the God-head, were under eternal obligations to love, honour and delight in each other, they were eternally di&s;qualified from covenanting together. The want of merit or worth, in the preceding article, di&s;qualified wicked men and devils, from covenanting with one another; and according to this, the merit or worth of the holy, di&s;qualify them from being parties in a covenant: and thus, according to the two la&s;t things 'nece&s;&s;arily In|cluded in a covenant,' it was impo&s;&s;ible, that a covenant ever could have taken place, or ever can, between the good in heaven, or on earth; or between the wicked on earth, or in hell.&mdash;Yet he &s;ays, <Q>The glo|rious tran&s;action of the covenant of grace, was <HI>only</HI> between the Father and the Son, and that before all worlds.</Q> But in contradiction to this, and all he has &s;aid to prove, that the covenant of grace could not have been made with Abraham, he &s;ays, p. t, 'This,' (the covenant of grace) <Q>Abraham had a di&s;covery of, was intere&s;ted in, and was <HI>renewed</HI> to him from time to time, till the covenant of circumci&s;ion was annexed to it.</Q> So according to the&s;e two propo&s;itions, the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion, which was made with Abraham, was annexed to the covenant of grace, which was <HI>only</HI> made between the father and the &s;on, before all worlds!</P>
<P><Q>How natural it is for mankind that would &s;upport error, to &s;train all their faculties, and almo&s;t do violence to &s;cripture and rea&s;on, in order to propagate a &s;cripturele&s;s tenet.</Q> See Mr. N's remarks, p. 19.</P></NOTE> it will be removed by con&s;idering the <HI>medium,</HI> through which all tran&s;actions take place, between an holy God and &s;inful creatures: <HI>through</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>a ble&s;&s;ed centre of agree|ment and communion.</HI> The union of the divine and human nature, in his per&s;on, or as the &s;criptures expre&s;s it, <HI>The ful|ne&s;s of the God-head dwelling in him bodily,</HI> perfectly qualifies him for the important office, of mediating between an offend|ed God and guilty &s;inners. In him, <HI>God is reconciling the world to him&s;elf,</HI> propo&s;ing the mo&s;t merciful terms and of|fers, and per&s;uading to a compliance, by the mo&s;t affecting con&s;iderations. An apprehen&s;ion and &s;en&s;e of the&s;e, exi&s;ting in the mind, expel from it that horror and dread, which a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in and guilt produce, allure and con&s;train it to a

<P>The&s;e &s;ubjects were anciently expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;acrifices, offered to God by his people. <HI>Noah builded an altar and of|fered &s;acrifices, And the Lord &s;melled a &s;weet &s;avour:</HI> this grateful odour aro&s;e from the re&s;pect this &s;acrifice had to Chri&s;t, who atoned for &s;in by <HI>the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf.

And he took unto him all the&s;e, and divided them in the mid&s;t, and laid each piece over again&s;t the other, but the birds be divided not.

Agreeably to the&s;e general ob&s;ervations, we find entering in|to covenant with God, to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of God's people, as con&s;tituting tho&s;e, who, only, will be accep|ted and rewarded in the general judgment: <HI>Gather my &s;aints together unto me, tho&s;e that have made a covenant with me by &s;acrifice.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 50.5.</NOTE> This brings me to con&s;ider</P>

II. The Terms.</P>

1. This is plainly implied in the predictions of the prophets.</P>
<P>Holy men of old made the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation a glorious &s;ubject of their prophecy. One of the events which they fore|told, as pertaining to it, was that of other nations uniting them&s;elves with the Jews, as the covenant people of God.

<P N="1">(1.) They do very plainly imply, That the po&s;terity of Abraham &s;hould exi&s;t, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, as the vi&s;ible people of God. This is agreeable to the eleva|ted prophecy of I&s;aiah, (chap. 54.1.) in which he &s;tiles the gentiles, <HI>the de&s;olate,</HI> and terms the Jews, <HI>the married wife:</HI> which the apo&s;tle quotes, (Gal. 4.27.) and applies to the gen|tiles termed, <HI>the de&s;olate,</HI> and the Jews, whom he repre&s;ents as having <HI>an hu&s;band.</HI> This doctrine, which is thus &s;ugge&s;t|ed in the prophecies of the old te&s;tament, is plainly implied, and clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the ob&s;ervations of the new.

The heathen acknow|ledged many other divinities. So the di&s;ciples acknowledged Chri&s;t to be the only true Me&s;&s;iah. Their oppo&s;ers denied their doctrine and rejected their faith.

<P>It is equally evident, That the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence are agreeable to the nature and a fulfilment of the covenant made with Abraham.

This is illu&s;trated by another a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>This I &s;ay, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the mini&s;ter of circumci&s;ion, for the truth of God, to confirm the promi&s;es made unto the fathers.</HI> By circum|ci&s;ion we mu&s;t under&s;tand, either the Jewi&s;h nation or church which was termed, <HI>The circumci&s;ion,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under &s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, The text repre&s;ents Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the grand mini&s;ter of the jewi&s;h nation or church, under who&s;e admini&s;tration, the promi&s;es made to the fathers, <HI>of ble&s;&s;ing all nations</HI> in Abraham, were ful|filled and confirmed, through which, the gentiles were united with the jews, and the Jewi&s;h church &s;tate enlarged, dignified and e&s;&s;entially perfected.</NOTE> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the gentiles who were called, <HI>The uncircumci&s;ion,</HI> or that cove|nant of which circumci&s;ion was the &s;eal or token: of this co|venant Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the mini&s;ter, the officer or agent, and the end for which he &s;u&s;tained this character or office, was to CONFIRM <HI>the promi&s;es made to the fathers, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob,</HI> which promi&s;es pertained e&s;&s;entially to that <HI>covenant which be made with Abraham, and his oath unto I&s;aac, and confirmed the &s;ame unto Jacob for a law, and unto I&s;rael for an everla&s;ting covenant, &s;aying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan&mdash;and in thy &s;eed &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;a. 105.9&mdash;12.

<P>It is manife&s;t from the general ob&s;ervations, That the terms and language of the covenant which God made with his an|cient friend, run through the old and new-Te&s;tament, and that according to the univer&s;al repre&s;entation of &s;cripture, the va|rious di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence, relative to the Jew|i&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="021898_0021_0FB5EC401339D448">and Chri&s;tian church, are made &s;ub&s;ervient to the accom|pli&s;hment of the promi&s;es, and an actual be&s;towment of the ble&s;&s;ings contained in it.&mdash;Let it &s;uffice to add, That the de&s;cription of the eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous, in the heavenly &s;tate, is in the expre&s;s terms and language of the im|portant promi&s;e contained in it,&mdash;<HI>And they &s;hall be his people, and God him&s;elf &s;hall be with them and be THEIR GOD.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 21.3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the covenant of grace has been defined and explain|ed &mdash;and &s;o demon&s;trably evident is it, that it was made with Abraham, and operates under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. The inference is clear and unavoidable, that the &s;eal of it is to be affixed to believers and <HI>their &s;eed,</HI> as it was in its original in|&s;titution.</P>
