<HEAD>THE IMPORTANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is agreed, I think, on all Hands, that the gaining and pre&s;erving the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, is of no &s;mall Importance to the Trade of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as to the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the&s;e Colonies: And, as I have not heard of any Body, that has, as yet, attempted to put this Matter in a proper Light, I &s;hall, with great Submi&s;&s;ion, humbly offer my Sentiments, in Hopes they may in|duce &s;ome abler Hand to undertake the Ta&s;k.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Ship arrived here from <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> it is &s;aid, were &s;o well-plea&s;ed, that they would have her tied to a Tree, in order the better to &s;ecure her; but as Cables were &s;ubject to rot, they would have it an Iron Chain, and this to be continued into the <HI>Indian</HI> Countries, that they might be the better able to keep their Part of it clear from Ru&s;t, as we were to keep our Part. If the <HI>Indians</HI> were in Di&s;tre&s;s or Want, the Call was, as it is at this Day, to come and make clean, or renew the Covenant Chain; and the Chri&s;t|ians on their Part, were to do the like: And accord|ingly we have a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their Wars and Wants, and they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in our Wars, and we have their Furs.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006699_0004_1029AB61AFB11370">
This is the original Contract and Treaty of Com|merce with the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> And thus Things went on tolerably well for &s;ome Years, 'till the due Execu|tion of this Treaty was committed to the Care of a Number of Commi&s;&s;ioners, mo&s;tly <HI>Anglo-Dutch</HI> Tra|ders in <HI>Indian</HI> Goods; who, together with a Tribe of Harpies or Handlers, their Relations, and Under|&s;trappers, have &s;o abu&s;ed, defrauded, and deceived tho&s;e poor, innocent, well-meaning People, that this Treaty has well-nigh executed it&s;elf; &s;o that at pre|&s;ent we have very few <HI>Indians</HI> left that are &s;incerely in our Intere&s;t, or that can be depended upon. The fatal Con&s;equences of this Management were &s;everely felt in many In&s;tances la&s;t War, particularly in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Saraghtoga, Schenectady,</HI> &amp;c. which could not po&s;&s;ibly have happened had our <HI>Indians</HI> been &s;incerely our Friends. And what fatal Con&s;equences mu&s;t attend a continued Neglect of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs; more e&s;pecially as the <HI>French,</HI> our natural Enemies and Competitors in every Corner of the World where we have any Con|cern, are indefatigable in cultivating the Friend&s;hip of their own <HI>Indians,</HI> and by all Means and Arts in their Power, <HI>per fas &amp; ne fas,</HI> endeavouring to &s;educe tho&s;e in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t; is apparent to the meane&s;t Ca|pacity. Murders and De&s;olation, upon the fir&s;t Breach, is one certain Con&s;equence; and I wi&s;h I could think this was all.</P>
<P>What to me is mo&s;t &s;urprizing, that, tho' there is hardly a Colony upon the Continent, but what is a Match for all <HI>Canada;</HI> yet, by a proper Management of their <HI>Indians,</HI> they keep us all, both in Time of Peace and War, in a con&s;tant Dread and Terror.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;eems at this Time di&s;|po&s;ed to take the&s;e Colonies under Con&s;ideration, it is the Duty, I conceive, of every Member of the Com|munity to throw in &s;uch Hints as he conceives may be of U&s;e upon this Occa&s;ion; and it is to be hop'd there
<PB N="7" REF="006699_0005_1029AB633218B500">are tho&s;e among&s;t us, of Capacity, Lei&s;ure and publick Spirit, &s;ufficient to model them into a proper Shape, for the Peru&s;al of that augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly. An hone&s;t Detail of Facts, and a fair View of the Importance of the Subject, is all that I &s;hall endeavour at, at pre&s;ent. It cannot be doubted, but that the Government at Home would a&s;&s;i&s;t us effectually, were our Situation and Circum&s;tances but perfectly known to them, and proper Methods propo&s;ed; becau&s;e it is really their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I do not mean here to put the Crown and the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> to any great Expence about us, further than that of one &s;ingle Officer, as Super-intendant of the Whole, who may have no Connection either with the Trade or People of the Country; and &s;ome Ar|tillery. The Crown already has expended many and great Sums to make us what we are; and the People of <HI>England</HI> are already &s;ufficiently loaded with Taxes; whereas we hardly know what they mean. The Co|lonies therefore, jointly, it is to be hop'd, will willingly contribute towards whatever Expence may attend a proper Regulation of our Trade and Frontiers; if not willingly, let us not di&s;pair but that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parlia|ment will oblige them. It is high Time we &s;hould look to our own Security, and mo&s;t unnatural to ex|pect, that we &s;hould hang forever upon the Brea&s;ts of our Mother-Country: We are &s;ufficiently able, and mu&s;t be made, &s;ome of us I doubt, at lea&s;t, willing. Whatever Pretences may be made, it is ab&s;olutely true, that the Pre&s;ervation of the whole Continent, depends upon a proper Regulation of the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> and the Security of the Frontiers of <HI>New-York,</HI> both to the Northward and Southward. I therefore, with great Submi&s;&s;ion, propo&s;e,</P>
<P>That a good &s;trong Fort be built at the <HI>Wood-Creek,</HI> or near it; it ought to be a regular Fortifica|tion; becau&s;e it is not impo&s;&s;ible to bring great Guns
<PB N="8" REF="006699_0006_1029AB64B5D0CF48">again&s;t it, from <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> from whence they pour in their Parties upon us, in Time of War. Here let there be a Magazine of all Kinds of warlike Stores, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with Snow-Shoes, &s;mall Hatchets, &amp;c. This will in a great Mea&s;ure protect the Country; and from thence a De&s;cent upon <HI>Canada</HI> may be very practicable.</P>
<P>That this Fort be able to contain <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Men in Time of War, and in Time of Peace never le&s;s than <HI>One Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>That there be an Addition of two Independent Companies, to the four already e&s;tabli&s;hed here, from the Highlands of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the wilder, the better for a common Garri&s;on there.</P>
<P>That all the Lands from <HI>Fort-Nichol&s;on,</HI> to <HI>Fort-Anne,</HI> that is, all the Lands upon the <HI>Carrying-Place,</HI> and tho&s;e adjacent, be &s;et apart for the U&s;e of &s;uch Highlanders only, as will &s;ettle there, and to be properly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their &s;ettling for the fir&s;t two or three Years. To each Man and his Wife One Hundred Acres; and to each &s;ingle Per&s;on, Man, Woman, or Child, Fifty Acres, without Fee or Reward, to them and their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>That near this Fort, at a proper Di&s;tance, there be erected a &s;mall Block-Hou&s;e, &s;ufficient for thirty <HI>Indians,</HI> to be kept there on con&s;tant Pay, during a War; five, <HI>viz.</HI> from each Nation, to be relieved and regulated in &s;uch Manner as the <HI>Six Nations</HI> them&s;elves think mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>That a Number of Commi&s;&s;ioners from all the Colonies, be appointed to meet yearly, at <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>Albany,</HI> in order to fix their re&s;pective Quotas for the general Expence, and for erecting &s;uch other Forts and Block-Hou&s;es as may be thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e Gentlemen jointly, be fully impowered to lay out Lands, (not already granted) mo&s;t conve|niently &s;ituated for a Frontier. And as it &s;eems very probable, that we &s;hall very &s;oon have a Run of <HI>Germans</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="006699_0007_1029AB66415FAF40">this Way, I &s;hould advi&s;e the laying-out of tho&s;e Lands after the <HI>New-England</HI> Manner, in Town&s;hips &s;ufficient for Sixty Families at lea&s;t; to be granted to them and their Heirs, without Fee or Reward, and clear of all Taxes and Quit-Rents, for ten Years at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>That in each Town&s;hip there be erected a good &s;trong Church, with Loop-Holes, and a few Field Pieces, which may &s;erve for a Retreat upon Occa&s;ion. Or rather, let publick Notices, in the mo&s;t authentick Manner, be &s;ent abroad to the Highlands of <HI>Scotland, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> where tho&s;e emigrant <HI>Germans</HI> have their Agents; that upon the Arrival in this Province of a Number of Families, not under Thirty; which Number, &s;uppo&s;ing five to a Family, is &s;ufficient to be|gin any Settlement, and as many as any one Ship &s;hould be allow'd to import at a Time; each Per&s;on, young or old, &s;hall be intitled to One Hundred Acres of good Land, granted to them and their Heirs, without Fee, or any other Incumbrance of Taxes, or Quit-Rent, for the fir&s;t ten Years. Their Pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;ome &s;mall additional Helps towards their fir&s;t &s;ettling, to be paid by the Colonies jointly; or let each Colony have its particular Colony or Town&s;hip, in that Country; Pro|vided always, that tho&s;e Lands be laid out &s;o as to form a Barrier. I would not have the&s;e Town&s;hips altogether <HI>Germans,</HI> but alternate. <HI>Philadelphia</HI> may one Day repent the va&s;t Importation of tho&s;e People among&s;t them; they are mo&s;t of them old Soldiers. I have Rea&s;on to know &s;omething of their Spirit, having had &s;ome Hand in di&s;arming 600 of them upon Account of a Mutiny in this Province; and it was my Fortune to command &s;ome of them upon the Expedition again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> in 1711. A Society of Free-Men, ab&s;olutely di&s;claiming the U&s;e of Arms, and at the &s;ame Time encouraging the Introduction of va&s;t Numbers of old Soldiers, and foreign too, who hardly know what the Word LIBERTY means; is a Contra&s;t which <HI>they</HI> only can account for.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006699_0008_1029AB6F1E7C7950">
That a String of Block-Hou&s;es be erected, &s;o as to make the Communication, or an Alarm, from one Garri&s;on, or Block-Hou&s;e, to another, ea&s;y, by Smoaks properly di&s;po&s;ed in the Day Time, or by throwing up a Number of Rockets, or firing Great Guns in the Night Time. Such an Expedient would be of great U&s;e during the War, as the <HI>Indians</HI> never attack but by Surprize, and would greatly di&s;courage <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy Parties, as it would keep our own Garri&s;ons upon the Watch, and our Out Scouts to their Duty. I do not think it at all impracticable, to convey an Alarm from <HI>Albany</HI> to <HI>New-York,</HI> in one Night, if Rockets or Great Guns were properly di&s;po&s;ed and attended. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for Example, a Party of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> abroad, which &s;eldom happens without being di&s;covered by &s;ome Out-Scout or other; upon Di&s;covery, if in the Day Time, let there be one great Smoak, and one Great Gun fired; which, if taken up by the other Garri&s;ons, I am confident <HI>that</HI> Party would hardly proceed. In order to di&s;cover what Cour&s;e the Party may take, let there be three Smoaks, two pretty near to one another, and the third at a proper Di&s;tance, either to the Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which will point out the Cour&s;e taken. This may be improved.</P>
<P>That in each of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> there be built a Fort of &s;ome Kind or other, where, and in what Manner that particular Nation be&s;t approves of.</P>
<P>That in the <HI>Onondago</HI> Country, where their general Councils are held, and the Archives of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are kept, &s;omething more than common be erected; this will do Honour to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and great|ly encourage the <HI>Indians,</HI> e&s;pecially in Time of War, while their old Men, Women, and Children are &s;ecure in a Fort, with a &s;mall Party of Chri&s;tians, their Excur&s;ions will be more free, and frequent: But, this Security ought to be left altogether to their own Choice; whether, by erecting one &s;ingle Fortification
<PB N="11" REF="006699_0009_1029AB70A1355F90">for the Retreat of the Whole; (the <HI>Senecas</HI> I &s;hould chu&s;e, being a fine Country, where great Encourage|ment ought to be given to Settlers, and where the <HI>Indians</HI> are le&s;s tainted with Chri&s;tian Vices); or whether each Nation &s;hould have their proper Retreat or Security.</P>
<P>What has hitherto prevented our <HI>Indians,</HI> in their Excur&s;ions again&s;t the Enemy, is, in my humble Opi|nion, in a great Mea&s;ure, owing to the Apprehen&s;ions of having their Ca&s;tles cut off in their Ab&s;ence; they have been often threatened, and indeed at pre&s;ent they have Nothing to tru&s;t to but their Heels: And No|thing, in my humble Opinion, has prevented the Attempt, but the Re&s;olutions of the <HI>Cachnawagas,</HI> their principal Fighters, (but De&s;erters from our <HI>Mohawks</HI>) not to &s;pill the Blood of their Relations and Country-men: And the &s;ame natural Affection has prevented our <HI>Indians</HI> from doing, what I am confi|dent they would have done, had they been &s;ure not to have met with their Friends and Country-men, the <HI>Cachnawagas.</HI> Proper Methods, therefore, ought to be taken to recover tho&s;e <HI>Indians;</HI> which I conceive, is very far from impracticable.</P>
<P>The villainous Treatment tho&s;e poor People have met with at <HI>Albany,</HI> from the Handlers, was the ori|ginal Cau&s;e of that De&s;ertion; and undoubtedly for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, many more do, and will de&s;ert, if proper Remedies are not &s;peedily applied.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, I am to ob&s;erve, that without a proper Regulation of the Trade, all other Endeavours to gain and pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indians,</HI> will avail but little. I &s;hall not enter further into a Di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of the Methods hitherto taken; but that tho&s;e poor <HI>Indians</HI> have for many Years been under the Direction of the People of <HI>Albany,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to deceive and defraud them, and that they have been deceived and defrauded accordingly, is notorious;
<PB N="12" REF="006699_0010_1029AB7268C5D9D8">In&s;tances in Abundance might be produced, but they are really too &s;hocking to relate. But that I may not be thought to talk without Book, I &s;hall here beg Leave to in&s;ert the Preamble to an Act of the Legi&s;lature here, to encourage the Indian Trade at <HI>Albany,</HI> 13th <HI>Anne.</HI> I have not heard of an Act of the kind &s;ince, tho' the Mi&s;chief has been daily increa&s;ing.</P>
<P><Q>Whereas great Endeavours have from Time to Time been u&s;ed by her Maje&s;ty's Governors, and Commanders in Chief of this Colony, to &s;ettle a Trade, and to have Commerce with &s;uch Indian Nations as live beyond our five confederated Nati|tions; which in Proce&s;s of Time, might not only be very advantageous, but al&s;o of great Security to the Frontiers of this Colony, at or near <HI>Albany,</HI> in Time of War; and &s;everal of the &s;aid <HI>Indians</HI> being lately come to the City of <HI>Albany,</HI> in order to trade with the Inhabitants thereof; but &s;everal private Per&s;ons, not regarding the Safety of this Colony, but only de&s;igning their own private Lucre, have, and do daily, u&s;e many indirect Means to engro&s;s the Trade into their Hands, by their Contrivance with tho&s;e who are employed by the &s;aid <HI>Indians</HI> to carry them in their Waggons to <HI>Albany;</HI> and having once gotten the Peltry, Beavers, or other Furs, of the &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, hinder them to make the be&s;t of their Market, to the Ruin of the &s;aid Trade, and the Alienation of the Affections of the &s;aid <HI>Indians</HI> from this Colony; and in&s;tead of &s;ecuring the Friend&s;hip of the &s;aid <HI>Indians,</HI> will, if not prevented, cau&s;e them to be our Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> This Act to continue for two Years.</P>
<P>The Principles to be laid down in the Manage|ment of our <HI>Indians,</HI> are, fir&s;t, by all Means to endea|vour to under-&s;ell the <HI>French;</HI> and the next is, to do Ju&s;tice to the <HI>Indians</HI> in tho&s;e Sales. For which Rea&s;on I &s;hould advi&s;e, that this Trade, in&s;tead of being under
<PB N="13" REF="006699_0011_1029AB73EF211BF8">the Direction of the People of <HI>Albany,</HI> who are mo&s;t of them, if not altogether, Traders, or Handlers, and who&s;e Intere&s;t it is, to take all Advantages of tho&s;e poor People, and that with Impunity, as they have no Body to complain to, the principal Directors being all Traders, and of Cour&s;e <HI>Socii Criminis.</HI></P>
<P>That it be put under the Direction of one &s;ingle Per&s;on of Capacity and Integrity, of his Maje&s;ty's Appointment, during good Behaviour, with a hand&s;ome Allowance, in the Nature of a <HI>Superintendant of Indian Affairs,</HI> with full Powers to do &s;ummary Ju&s;tice upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>That he be debarr'd trading directly or indirectly, upon the &s;evere&s;t Penalties.</P>
<P>That he take his In&s;tructions from the Governor and Council; and report to them, at lea&s;t twice a Year, a State of Indian Affairs, in order to be laid before his Maje&s;ty, or the Board of Trade.</P>
<P>That he be obliged to make a Tour through the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> once a Year at lea&s;t, with a proper Equi|page, and &s;ome &s;mall Pre&s;ents for the chief Men; when and where he may receive Complaints, and redre&s;s Grievances.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ave the Crown the Expence of &s;uch an Officer, I &s;hould advi&s;e, that as there are two Surveyor Generals of the Cu&s;toms upon this Continent, at an Allowance of a Guinea a Day, and Sixty Pounds <HI>Sterl.</HI> yearly each of them for a Clerk; that upon the Demi&s;e of either, that Officer be &s;et apart for this U&s;e, one Surveyor General is &s;ufficient for all the Purpo&s;es of the Cu&s;toms upon this Continent; the Officers being rather in the Nature of preventive Officers, that is, their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is to prevent any European Goods being imported from any Part but from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to prevent the Exportation of any of the enumerated Commodities, to any Parts, but to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> this, I &s;ay, is the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="006699_0012_1029AB7CB3733FD8">of the Officers upon this Continent; and the &s;everal Governors, upon their Admi&s;&s;ion to their Governments, are obliged by Act of Parliament, to take an Oath, to &s;ee this duly executed. There are no Revenues collected by the Offices here, nor no Accounts worth mentioning to comptrole. From hence I conclude, that one of tho&s;e Officers at lea&s;t, may be very well &s;pared for the above Purpo&s;e, and much better employed.</P>
<P>That there be a hand&s;ome Allowance made for two Interpreters at lea&s;t; one indeed for each Nation I &s;hould not think too much: One of them always to attend the principal Officer.</P>
<P>That there be a Smith appointed by the principal Officer, with a proper Allowance, in each Nation, with two Apprentices, in order to multiply Interpreters; for want of which, I doubt we have often been mi&s;led; and if tho&s;e Smiths were obliged to teach one or two Indian Youths of the be&s;t Capacities, to read and write <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it might be of great U&s;e, as nothing is &s;o much wanted as hone&s;t Interpreters.</P>
<P>That every Per&s;on employed by the Publick in this Service, be prohibited Trading, directly or indirectly, under &s;evere Penalties, and give Security for the due Execution of his Duty; and to be on Oath obliged to repre&s;ent every Grievance he conceives the <HI>Indians</HI> meet with from the Traders. As all Monopolies are the Bane of Trade, I would have this open and free for all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects; by this Means a Number of <HI>Bu&s;h-Lopers,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI> call them, and the <HI>French,</HI> who are indefatigable in this Point, <HI>Coureurs Debois,</HI> are created; a Set of Men, who, from their Acquaintance with the Woods and Indians, are very u&s;eful upon many Occa&s;ions, e&s;pecially in Time of War.</P>
<P>That there be lodged in the Hands of every Smith, or Agent for that Purpo&s;e, <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, to the Value of &pound;.&mdash;always by them; which they are to di&s;po&s;e of for the U&s;e of the Publick, according to

<P>From this I have only to ob&s;erve, That had our <HI>Indian</HI> Trade been under &s;uch a Regulation, or indeed any Regulation at all, we &s;hould have le&s;s to apprehend at this Day: And, that it is high Time to make a Beginning.</P>
<P>A grand Fair yearly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to be kept alternately; to begin fir&s;t in the <HI>Onondage</HI> Country, the next Year in the <HI>Seneca</HI> Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which all the Nations, far and near, may have due Notice; and where the Super-intendant, or In&s;pector-General, &s;hould always attend; might be of great U&s;e: And the Prices of Goods being fixed from the late&s;t Invoices from <HI>New-York,</HI> it would be a great Induce|ment to the far Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as our own, to purcha&s;e, and would at the &s;ame Time be a Check upon the Handlers at <HI>O&s;wego,</HI> as well as el&s;ewhere. One e&s;&s;ential Article in our Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and upon which, in a great Mea&s;ure, their All depends, has been hitherto much neglected on our Part; and that is, from us they have the cheape&s;t Engli&s;h Arms and Ammunition, and of Cour&s;e the wor&s;t upon the Face of the Earth: The <HI>French</HI> take Care to &s;upply them with what is really good; and I believe at a cheap|er Rate than we can afford the be&s;t of ours; by which Means I doubt, they will ever be able to under&s;ell us in that e&s;&s;ential Article, unle&s;s &s;ome effectual Methods are fallen upon to prevent it; &s;uch as allowing us the Importation of a Quantity of Powder for that Purpo&s;e only from <HI>Holland;</HI> the Traders have attempted this, to their Co&s;t.

<P>That in&s;tead of &s;upporting this Trade by Way of Licence, which has hitherto been but oddly managed, that there be a Duty, applicable only to <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and thrown into the joint Stock, upon all <HI>Indian</HI> Goods, exported either by Land or Water; and likewi&s;e upon all Furs and Skins imported, <HI>under the Direction of the Officers of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms: Tho&s;e appointed by the Country, have generally more Regard to their Friends than their Duty.</HI> This has been formerly practi&s;ed here, and I humbly conceive will an&s;wer every Purpo&s;e much better.

<P>We have been at an infinite Expence from the Beginning of Times, in fortifying, and in Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Indians,</HI> with very little A&s;&s;i&s;tance from our neigh|bour Colonies; a Charge which we are hardly able to bear, and mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, as every other Colony upon the Continent, is in &s;ome Degree or other, con|cerned in the Pre&s;ervation of the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Security of our Frontiers. This, however, has been but paliating Matters; and doing Things by Halves: Whenever the Colonies think fit to join, <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs will wear quite another A&s;pect. The very Name of &s;uch a Confederacy will greatly en|courage our <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;trike Terror into the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> and be a Means to prevent their un&s;upportable In|croachments, which they daily make with Impunity and In&s;ult; And this is what they have long dreaded.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="006699_0017_1029AB8B53FA8C38">
A long Series of Ill-u&s;age from the Traders, has given the <HI>Indians</HI> but a very indifferent Opinion of our Morals; and of late, from the &s;everal abortive Expe|ditions, they begin, I doubt, to &s;u&s;pect our Courage; than which, Nothing can more affect our Intere&s;t with them&punc; They of them&s;elves are hone&s;t, &s;uch at lea&s;t as have not been debauched by the Chri&s;tians; and brave in their Way; and de&s;pi&s;e Knaves and Cowards.

<P><Q>Pur&s;uant whereunto you are, as Occa&s;ion requires, to call for the &s;ame; and in Ca&s;e of any Inva&s;ion upon the neighbouring Plantations, you are, upon Applica|tion of the re&s;pective Governors thereof, to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to them, in the be&s;t Manner you can; and as the Condition of your Government will permit.</Q></P>
<P>As to this In&s;truction, his Maje&s;ty, I doubt, has not been thoroughly informed: Becau&s;e, upon an Inva&s;ion, con&s;idering the Di&s;tance and Dilatorine&s;s of A&s;&s;emblies, the Mi&s;chief, in all Probability, would be over before we could have any A&s;&s;i&s;tance: I &s;hould, therefore, think it advi&s;eable, that tho&s;e Pro|portions be immediately detached to the Frontiers, upon the fir&s;t News of a War; there to remain, and
<PB N="22" REF="006699_0020_1029AB9198BF5F78">to be recruited during the War, at the Expence of the &s;aid Colonies. I &s;hudder to think what would have been the Fate of <HI>Albany,</HI> had not tho&s;e Troops, de&s;ign|ed again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> been accidentally there; more e|&s;pecially as the People of <HI>Albany,</HI> at that Time, were afflicted with an epidemical Di&s;temper, which carried off great Numbers.</P>
<P>From hence his Maje&s;ty's Care is apparent; and why tho&s;e In&s;tructions have not been hitherto duly ob|&s;erved, is what I &s;hall not take upon me to determine: I cannot, however, help thinking, that, from upwards of forty Years Ob&s;ervations upon the Conduct of our Colony A&s;&s;emblies, and the little Regard paid by them to In&s;tructions, if it is left altogether to them, the Whole will end in Altercation and Words. By the above In&s;tructions it appears, that his Maje&s;ty is fully apprized of the Con&s;equences of leaving this Colony unguarded; as well as of its Inability to an&s;wer his mo&s;t gracious Intentions.</P>
<P>I &s;hould therefore advi&s;e, That the Quotas be doubled, which they can now very well bear; and both the <HI>Carolinas</HI> added, and the Whole enforced by an Act of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In that Ca&s;e, if this pre&s;ent Scheme, or &s;omething like it, as I am very far from thinking, but that it will admit of many Improvements, and for that Purpo&s;e it is offered, is duly executed, I will venture to prophecy, that in twenty Years the whole Fur Trade will be in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hands, and that the Fur Trade Company in <HI>Canada,</HI> will &s;ink, upon which the very Being of that Country depends.</P>
<P>I have only further, with great Submi&s;&s;ion, to advi&s;e, that the Meeting of the <HI>Indians</HI> be alternate; one Year at <HI>New-York,</HI> which will add but very little to the Expence, and where the Commi&s;&s;ioners from tho&s;e contributing Colonies, may more conveniently attend, and where, it is to be hoped, the <HI>Indians</HI> may receive
<PB N="23" REF="006699_0021_1029AB96923ED278">&s;ome better Impre&s;&s;ions of our People, than they have hitherto done at <HI>Albany;</HI> the next Year any where, but at <HI>Albany</HI> or <HI>Schenectady.</HI> That the Pre&s;ents made upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, as &s;oon as viewed, and divided by the particular Nations, be packed up again, in &s;uch Manner, as may make the Carriage the ea&s;ie&s;t, of which they them&s;elves will be the be&s;t Judges, and locked up, and the Keys to be delivered to the principal Sachem of each Nation, and not to be opened 'till they arrive in their own Country. I believe, I may venture to affirm, that the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e Pre&s;ents made them upon tho&s;e &s;olemn Occa&s;ions, &s;eldom go further than <HI>Albany</HI> or <HI>Schenectady,</HI> but are bought up by the Handlers, for Rum, and afterwards &s;old to them when &s;ober, at a dear Rate. I would propo&s;e this Method, being well a&s;&s;ured, there is no Law can be contrived, or Oath framed, to bind a Handler.</P>
<P>[<HI>So much for our Northern Frontiers.</HI>]</P>
<P>AS to our Southern Frontiers, the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I mean, of <HI>NewYork,</HI> let tho&s;e be altogether under the Direction, and at the Expence of the Colony of <HI>NewYork;</HI> hoping withal, his Maje&s;ty will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to favour us with a &s;mall Detachment of Gun|ners, and one Engineer, for &s;ome Time at lea&s;t, toge|ther with &s;ome Artillery and Ammunition. Large Sums have been expended, or rather &s;quandered away upon this Account, by the Country, to very little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let there be two Batteries erected at the <HI>Narrows;</HI> one on each Side, in proper Places, and with Brea&s;t-Works only; any Fortifications there, may fall into the Enemy's Hands, and have bad Con&s;equences, The&s;e Batteries to be under the Care of the adjoining Counties; that on the Ea&s;t Side, under the Care of the Regiment of <HI>Kings</HI> County; and that on the We&s;t Side, under the Care of the Regiment of <HI>Richmond</HI> County.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="006699_0022_1029AB99DCBEE6E8">
Our utmo&s;t Endeavours mu&s;t be in the fir&s;t Place, to prevent the Enemy's Landing; and al&s;o in the next Place, to prevent a Bombardment. For this Purpo&s;e it may be nece&s;&s;ary, narrowly to view the Coa&s;t below the two fir&s;t Batteries. Should an Enemy land at or near <HI>New-Utrecht,</HI> the March is ea&s;y, even with Can|non, from thence to the Ferry, of which we &s;hould &s;oon feel the Effects. Low Batteries, as I would have all tho&s;e to be, even with the Water if po&s;&s;ible, at <HI>Red</HI> and <HI>Yellow-Hook,</HI> will be a Means to prevent a Bom|bardment, and the Enemy's Landing upon <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> A &s;mall Battery upon <HI>Kennedy's-I&s;land,</HI> may be of U&s;e. Let there be &s;everal &s;mall Batteries fixed round <HI>Nutten-I&s;land,</HI> of heavy Cannon, and it were to be wi&s;hed they were all &s;uch; and one &s;trong Entrenchment in the Middle, for a Number of Troops.</P>
<P>At the Ea&s;t End of the Town, a good Battery will be nece&s;&s;ary, as well as &s;everal along <HI>Hud&s;on's-River.</HI></P>
<P>I would not have any of tho&s;e Batteries exceed five Guns; but to be placed the thicker. Ships generally aim at one Battery at a Time. Be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know where a Ship may lye. In this Ca&s;e, it is odds but &s;ome of our Batteries may take her up.</P>
<P>Brea&s;t-Works, with Block-Hou&s;es in&s;tead of Stock|adoes, would an&s;wer all Purpo&s;es much better, be much le&s;s Expence, and la&s;t longer.</P>
<P>As to the Fort, and the lower Batteries, they are altogether ill de&s;igned, and as badly executed. But as our late Engineer has reported to his Excellency, the Failures, and the Improvements that may be made, &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t any &s;udden Attack, to that I refer.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;tant Rule, that every detached Work, however in&s;ignificant in it&s;elf, &s;hould have its Ammu|nition at Hand, to be come at without Difficulty or Danger; One Hundred Weight of Powder to each Gun.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006699_0023_1029AB9D356F9890">
The Regiments of <HI>Suffolk, Queens</HI> and <HI>Kings</HI> Coun|ties, <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>We&s;tche&s;ter,</HI> will be Force &s;ufficient to defend the City, if they can be brought together with Regularity and Certainty; to which, however, may be added, the Militia of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> County.

<P>Beacons, or rather Smoaks, in the Day Time, and Rockets or Great Guns in the Night, for this Purpo&s;e, will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>If the&s;e Things, or &s;omething of this kind, perhaps from an abler Hand, be duly con&s;idered, and executed, during the Calm of a Peace, we &s;hall have little to apprehend from an Enemy. What I mo&s;t apprehend

<HEAD>The Author of the foregoing ESSAY, having de&s;ired the Printer to communicate the Manu|&s;cript to &s;ome of the mo&s;t judicious of his Friends, it produced the following LETTER from one of them: The publi&s;hing whereof, we think, needs no other Apology, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Philadelphia, <DATE>March <HI>20, 1750, 1.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>Dear Mr.</HI> Parker,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have, as you de&s;ire, read the Manu&s;cript you &s;ent me; and am of Opinion, with the publick-&s;pirited Author, that &s;ecuring the Friend&s;hip of the <HI>Indians</HI> is of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to the&s;e Colonies; and that the &s;ure&s;t Means of doing it, are, to regulate the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, &s;o as to convince them, by Experience, that they may have the be&s;t and cheape&s;t Goods, and the faire&s;t Dealing from the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and to unite the &s;e|veral Governments, &s;o as to form a Strength that the <HI>Indians</HI> may depend on for Protection, in Ca&s;e of a Rupture with the <HI>French;</HI> or apprehend great Danger from, if they &s;hould break with us.</P>
<P>This Union of the Colonies, however nece&s;&s;ary, I apprehend is not to be brought about by the Means that have hitherto been u&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e. A Governor of one Colony, who happens from &s;ome Circum&s;tances in his own Government, to &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an Union, writes his Sentiments of the Matter to the other Governors, and de&s;ires them to recommend it to their re&s;pective A&s;&s;emblies. They accordingly lay the Letters before tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, and perhaps recommend the Propo&s;al in general Words. But Governors are often on ill Terms with their A&s;&s;emblies, and &s;eldom are the Men that have the mo&s;t Influence among them. And
<PB N="28" REF="006699_0026_1029ABA58C6EBD40">perhaps &s;ome Governors, tho' they openly recommend the Scheme, may privately throw cold Water on it, as thinking additional publick Charges will make their People le&s;s able, or le&s;s willing to give to them. Or perhaps they do not clearly &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, and therefore do not very earne&s;tly pre&s;s the Con&s;ideration of it: And no one being pre&s;ent that has the Affair at Heart, to back it, to an&s;wer and remove Objections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis ea&s;ily dropt, and nothing is done.&mdash;Such an Union is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to us all, but more immediately &s;o to your Government. Now, if you were to pick out half a Dozen Men of good Under&s;tanding and Addre&s;s, and furni&s;h them with a rea&s;onable Scheme and proper In&s;tructions, and &s;end them in the Nature of Amba&s;&s;adors to the other Colonies, where they might apply particularly to all the leading Men, and by proper Management get them to engage in promoting the Scheme; where, by being pre&s;ent, they would have the Opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing the Affair both in publick and private, obviating Difficulties as they ari&s;e, an&s;wering Objections as &s;oon as they are made, before they &s;pread and gather Strength in the Minds of the People, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> I imagine &s;uch an Union might thereby be made and e&s;tabli&s;hed: For rea&s;onable &s;en&s;ible Men, can always make a rea&s;onable Scheme appear &s;uch to other rea&s;onable Men, if they take Pains, and have Time and Opportunity for it; unle&s;s from &s;ome Circum&s;tances their Hone&s;ty and good Intentions are &s;u&s;pected. A voluntary Union entered into by the Colonies them&s;elves, I think, would be preferable to one impos'd by Parliament; for it would be perhaps not much more difficult to procure, and more ea&s;y to alter and improve, as Circum&s;tances &s;hould require, and Ex|perience direct. It would be a very &s;trange Thing, if &s;ix Nations of ignorant Savages &s;hould be capable of forming a Scheme for &s;uch an Union, and be able to execute it in &s;uch a Manner, as that it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted Ages, and appears indi&s;&s;oluble; and yet that a like Union &s;hould be impracticable for ten or a Dozen <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, to
<PB N="29" REF="006699_0027_1029ABAA9F370720">whom it is more nece&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t be more advanta|geous; and who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to want an equal Under&s;tanding of their Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Were there a general Council form'd by all the Colonies, and a general Governor appointed by the Crown to pre&s;ide in that Council, or in &s;ome Manner to concur with and confirm their Acts, and take Care of the Execution; every Thing relating to Indian Affairs and the Defence of the Colomes, might be properly put under their Management. Each Colony &s;hould be repre&s;ented by as many Members as it pays Sums of Hundred Pounds into the common Trea&s;ury for the common Expence; which Trea&s;ury would perhaps be be&s;t and mo&s;t equitably &s;upply'd, by an equal Exci&s;e on &s;trong Liquors in all the Colonies, the Produce never to be apply'd to the private U&s;e of any Colony, but to the general Service. Perhaps if the Council were to meet &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at the Capitals of the &s;everal Colonies, they might thereby become better acquainted with the Circum&s;tances, Intere&s;ts, Strength or Weakne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all, and thence be able to judge better of Mea&s;ures propos'd from time to time. At lea&s;t it might be more &s;atisfactory to the Colonies, if this were propos'd as a Part of the Scheme; for a Preference might create Jealou&s;y and Di&s;like.</P>
<P>I believe the Place mention'd is a very &s;uitable one to build a Fort on. In Times of Peace, Parties of the Garri&s;ons of all Frontier Forts might be allowed to go out on Hunting Expeditions, with or without Indians, and have the Profit to them&s;elves of the Skins they get: By this Means a Number of Wood-Runners would be form'd, well acquainted with the Country, and of great U&s;e in War Time, as Guides of Parties and Scouts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash; Every Indian is a Hunter; and as their Manner of making War, <HI>viz.</HI> by Skulking, Surprizing and Killing particular Per&s;ons and Families, is ju&s;t the &s;ame as their Manner of Hunting, only changing the Object, Every Indian is a di&s;ciplin'd Soldier, Soldiers of this Kind
<PB N="30" REF="006699_0028_1029ABAE361CD050">are always wanted in the Colonies in an Indian War; for the <HI>European</HI> Military Di&s;cipline is of little U&s;e in the&s;e Woods.</P>
<P>Publick Trading Hou&s;es would certainly have a good Effect towards regulating the private Trade; and preventing the Impo&s;itions of the private Traders; and therefore &s;uch &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;uitable Places all along the Frontiers; and the Superintendant of the Trade, propos'd by the Author, would, I think, be a u&s;eful Officer.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation concerning the Importation of <HI>Germans</HI> in too great Numbers into <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> is, I believe, a very ju&s;t one. This will in a few Years become a <HI>German</HI> Colony: In&s;tead of their Learning our Language, we mu&s;t learn their's, or live as in a foreign Country. Already the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> begin to quit particular Neighbourhoods &s;urrounded by <HI>Dutch,</HI> being made unea&s;y by the Di&s;agreeablene&s;s of di&s;onant Man|ners; and in Time, Numbers will probably quit the Province for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Dutch</HI> under-live, and are thereby enabled to under-work and under-&s;ell the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> who are thereby extreamly in|commoded, and con&s;equently di&s;gu&s;ted, &s;o that there can be no cordial Affection or Unity between the two Nations. How good Subjects they may make, and how faithful to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, is a Que&s;tion worth con&s;idering. And in my Opinion, equal Numbers might have been &s;pared from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands without being mi&s;s'd there, and on proper Encouragement would have come over. I &s;ay without being mi&s;s'd, perhaps I might &s;ay without le&s;&s;ening the Number of People at Home. I que&s;tion indeed, whether there be a Man the le&s;s in <HI>Britain</HI> for the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Colonies. An I&s;land can &s;upport but a certain Number of People: When all Employments are full, Multitudes refrain Marriage, 'till they can &s;ee how to maintain a Family. The Number of Engli&s;hmen in <HI>England,</HI> cannot by their pre&s;ent common Increa&s;e be
<PB N="31" REF="006699_0029_1029ABAFB8E92B08">doubled in a Thou&s;and Years; but if half of them were taken away and planted in <HI>America,</HI> where there is Room for them to encrea&s;e, and &s;ufficient Employment and Sub&s;i&s;tance; the Number of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> would be doubled in <HI>100 Years:</HI> For tho&s;e left at home, would multiply in that Time &s;o as to fill up the Vacancy, and tho&s;e here would at lea&s;t keep Pace with them.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t approve the Propo&s;al of encouraging a Number of &s;ober di&s;creet Smiths to re&s;ide among the <HI>Indians.</HI> They would doubtle&s;s be of great Service. The whole Sub&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Indians,</HI> depends on keeping their Guns in order; and if they are obliged to make a Journey of two or three hundred Miles to an Engli&s;h Settlement to get a Lock mended; it may, be&s;ides the Trouble, occa&s;ion the Lo&s;s of their Hunting Sea&s;on. They are People that think much of their temporal, but little of their &s;piritual Intere&s;ts; and therefore, as he would be a mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary Man to them, a Smith is more likely to influence them than a Je&s;uit; provided he has a good common Under&s;tanding, and is from time to time well in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could offer any Thing for the Improvement of the Author's Piece, but I have little Knowledge, and le&s;s Experience in the&s;e Matters. I think it ought to be printed; and &s;hould be glad there were a more general Communication of the Sentiments of judicious Men, on Subjects &s;o generally intere&s;ting; it would certainly pro|duce good Effects. Plea&s;e to pre&s;ent my Re&s;pects to the Gentleman, and thank him for the Peru&s;al of his Manu&s;cript.</P>
