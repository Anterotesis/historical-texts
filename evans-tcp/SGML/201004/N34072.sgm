<P>THE following expo&s;tulation with &s;lave hold|ers, is ab&s;tracted from the works of Richard Baxter, an eminent author, and di&s;&s;enting preach|er of the la&s;t century, and is now republi&s;hed as an evidence that the &s;ame Divine principle which hath enlightened the minds of many in the pre|&s;ent age, wich a &s;en&s;e of liberty, and influenced the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;e the inhumanity and inju&s;tice of the barbarous trade to Africa, for the purpo&s;e of en|&s;laving the poor untutored Negroes, and continu|ing them and their offspring in bondage, was clearly &s;een to be unchri&s;tian and unju&s;t, at &s;o early a period as that in which the author wrote, viz. in <HI>1673.</HI> And it is not becau&s;e the iniqui|tous practice hath been &s;ince unreproved, by ju|dicious and con&s;ciencious men, that it is not yet aboli&s;hed, but rather that avarice, pride, and ig|norance hath &s;o unhappily prevailed over ju&s;tice and mercy, as to continue great numbers of pro|fe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians in partaking of the unrighteous gain of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And in order to pre&s;erve from oblivion, and for general information, it is thought expedient to &s;ubjoin a letter from the truly pious <HI>Anthony Benezet,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, who was well known to be an uniform prudent advocate for relief of the oppre&s;&s;ed, to the famous Abbe Raynal, with his an&s;wer, which fir&s;t appeared in the Bru&s;&s;els ga|zette, of March, <HI>1782,</HI> and from thence publi&s;h|ed in one of the news papers of this city.</P>

<P><HI>"Directions to tho&s;e Ma&s;ters, in Foreign Plantations, who have Negroes and other Slaves, being a Solution of &s;eve|ral Ca&s;es about them.</HI></P>
<P>"UNDERSTAND well how far your power over your &s;laves extendeth, and what limits God hath &s;et thereto; &s;uch as is a &s;ufficient difference between men and brutes, that they are of as good a kind as you, that is, they are rea&s;onable creatures as well as you, and born to as much natural liberty; that they have immortal &s;ouls, and are equally capable of &s;alvation with your|&s;elves; Remember that God is their ab&s;olute owner, and that you have none but a derived and limited property in them; that they and you are equally under the go|vernment and laws of God;&mdash;Remember that God is their tender Father, and if they be as good, doth love them as well as you, and that the greater your power is over them, the greater your charge is of them, and your duty for them; the fourth Commandment requireth ma&s;ters to &s;ee that all within their gates ob&s;erve the Sab|bath day, &s;o mu&s;t you exerci&s;e both your power and love to bring them to the knowledge and faith of Chri&s;t, and to the ju&s;t obedience of God's commands.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore, that keep their Negroes and &s;laves from hearing God's word, and from becoming Chri&s;tians, do openly profe&s;s contempt of Chri&s;t the Redeemer, and contempt of the &s;ouls of men, and indeed they declare that, their worldly profit is their trea&s;ure, and their God."</P>
<P>"If this comes to the hands of any of our natives in
<PB N="5" REF="044647_0004_101EC317F4368BF0">Barbadoes, or other i&s;lands and plantations, who are &s;aid to be guilty of this mo&s;t heinous &s;in, yea, and to live upon it, intreat them further to con&s;ider, how cur&s;ed a crime it is to equal men to bea&s;ts? Is not this your prac|tice? Do you not buy them and u&s;e them merely to the &s;ame end as you do your hor&s;es; to labour for your com|modity, as if they were ba&s;er than you and made to &s;erve you? Do you not &s;ee how you reproach and condemn your&s;elves, while you vilify them as &s;avages and barba|rous wretches? Did they ever do any thing more &s;avage, than to u&s;e not only men's bodies as bea&s;ts, but their &s;ouls, as if they were made for nothing but to actuate their bodies in your worldly drudgery?</P>
<P>"Doth not the very example of &s;uch cruelty, be&s;ides your keeping them from Chri&s;tianity, directly tend to teach them to hate Chri&s;tianity, as if it taught men to be &s;o much wor&s;e than dogs, or tygers?</P>
<P>"Do you not mark how God hath followed you with plagues? and may not con&s;cience tell you, that it is for your inhumanity to the &s;ouls and bodies of &s;o many? Remember the late fire at the bridge, in Barbadoes; Re|member the drowning of your governor, lo&s;s of &s;hips at &s;ea, and the many judgments that have overtaken you, and at the pre&s;ent, the terrible mortality that is among you.</P>
<P>"Will not the example and warning of neighbouring countries ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t you, and condemn you? You cannot but hear how odious the Spani&s;h name is made (and thereby, alas! the Chri&s;tian name al&s;o, a|mong the We&s;t Indians) for their mo&s;t inhuman cruelties in Hi&s;paniola, Jamaica, Cuba, Peru, Mexico, and other places, which are de&s;cribed by Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta, a je&s;uit of their own; And what comfort are you like to have, at la&s;t, in that money which is purcha&s;ed at &s;uch a price? Will not your money and you peri&s;h together? Will not you have a wor&s;e than Gehazi's lepro&s;y, with it? Yea, wor&s;e than Achan's death by &s;toning; and as bad as Ju|das his hanging him&s;elf, unle&s;s repentance &s;hall prevent it? Do you not remember the terrible words in Jude, "<HI>Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain,
<PB N="6" REF="044647_0005_101EC31A58EFBA60">and ran greedily after the error of Balaam;</HI> and ii. Peter, 2, 3, 14, 15, <HI>through covetou&s;ne&s;s they make merchandi&s;e of you. An heart they have exerci&s;ed with covetous practices; cur&s;ed children (or children of a cur&s;e) which have for&s;aken the right way, and are gone a&s;tray, following the way of Balaam, the &s;on of Bezor, who loved the wages of unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s; but was rebuked for his iniquity; the dumb a&s;s &s;peaking with man's voice, forbad the madne&s;s of the pro|phet.</HI> When you &s;hall every one hear, <HI>Thou fool, this night &s;hall thy &s;oul be required of thee, and then who&s;e &s;hall all the&s;e things be, which thou ha&s;t provided.</HI> Luke xii. 19, 20, 21."</P>
<P>"What men in the world doth James &s;peak to, if not to you&mdash;James v. 1 to 4. <HI>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and bowl for your mi&s;eries that &s;hall come upon you: Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten: your gold and &s;ilver is cankered, and the ru&s;t of them &s;hall be a witne&s;s again&s;t you, and &s;hall eat your fle&s;h as it were fire: Ye have heaped trea&s;ure, together for the la&s;t days: Behold the hire of the labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped, have entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth;</HI>" How much more then the cry of betrayed &s;ouls?</P>
<P>After the&s;e animadver&s;ions on the iniquity of holding and treating men as &s;laves, for the private emolument of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, he proceeds to con&s;ider divers ca&s;es under which men are held in bondage, from whence he adduces the following conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>"A nominal Chri&s;tian, who by wickedne&s;s forfeit|eth his life or freedom, may penally be made a &s;lave as well as an Infidel; and a poor and needy Chri&s;tian may &s;ell him&s;elf into a harder &s;tate of &s;ervitude than he would chu&s;e, or we could otherwi&s;e put him into; but to go as|pirates, and catch up poor Negroes, or people of another land, that never forfeited life or liberty, and to make them &s;laves and &s;ell them, is one of the wor&s;t kinds of thefts in the world, and &s;uch per&s;ons are to be taken for the common enemies of mankind; and they that buy them, and u&s;e them as bea&s;ts for their mere commodity,
<PB N="7" REF="044647_0006_101EC31D8DC8F610">and betray, or de&s;troy, or neglect their &s;ouls, are fitter to be called incarnate Devils, than Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>He then queries; "But what if men buy Negroes, or other &s;laves, of &s;uch as we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to believe did &s;teal them by piracy, or buy them of tho&s;e who have no power to &s;ell them, and not hire, or buy them by their own con&s;ent, or by the con&s;ent of tho&s;e who had power to &s;ell them, nor take them captives.</P>
<P>And an&s;wers, "It is their heinous fin to buy them, unle&s;s it be in charity to deliver them from &s;lavery; hav|ing done it, undoubtedly they are pre&s;ently bound to de|liver them, becau&s;e, by right, the man is his own, and therefore, no man el&s;e can have a ju&s;t title to him.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion, "But may I not &s;ell him again, and make my money of him, &s;eeing I leave him as I found him&mdash;?</P>
<P>An&s;wer, "No; Becau&s;e when you have taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and he becomes a pretended property, then the injury that is done him is by you, which, before, was only by another; and tho' the wrong be no greater than the other did him, yet, being done by you, it is your &s;in.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion, "But may I not return him to him that I bought him of?</P>
<P>An&s;wer, "No; for that is but injuring him, by de|livering him to another to continue the injury: To &s;ay as Pilate <HI>(I am innocent of the blood of this ju&s;t man)</HI> will be no proof of your innocence: Yea, God's law bindeth you to love, and works of love, and therefore you &s;hould do your be&s;t to free him. He that is bound to help to &s;ave a man that is fallen into the hands of thieves, by the high way, if he &s;hould buy that man, as a &s;lave, of the thieves, may not after, give him up to thieves again.</P>
<P>"If they be Infidels, u&s;e them &s;o as tendeth to win them to Chri&s;t, and the love of religion, by &s;hewing them that Chri&s;tians are le&s;s worldly, le&s;s cruel and le&s;s pa&s;&s;i|onate, and more wi&s;e, charitable, holy and meek than a|ny other per&s;ons are.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My friend Abb&eacute; Raynal,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>From the idea which I conceived of the ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity of thy &s;entiments, I took the liberty of writing to thee, about 7 or 8 months pa&s;t, under cover of my friend B. F. and likewi&s;e by J. B. who, we are afraid, was lo&s;t on his pa&s;&s;age. Having received no an&s;wer, by &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, nor knowing whether my letters reached thee, or whether thine mi&s;carried; and a good opportu|nity offering, by my friend Dr. G. I now &s;eize it to &s;end thee two copies of a &s;mall extract of the origin and prin|ciples of my brethren, the Quakers, whom, I ob&s;erve in &s;uch of thy writings which have come to our hands, thou did&s;t not think unworthy of thy attention.</P>
<P>I have nothing to add to what I already wrote thee, but &s;hall repeat my wi&s;h of &s;aluting thee affectionately, on the principles of rea&s;on and humanity, which con&s;ti|tute that grand circle of love and charity, unconfined by our parentage or country; but which, with affectionate cordiality, embraces the whole creation, earne&s;tly de&s;iring, to the utmo&s;t of my abilities, to promote the happine&s;s of all men, even my enemies them&s;elves, could I have any.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech God to give thee &s;trength, that thou may|e&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="044647_0008_101EC3279A1E5338">continue to hold up to mankind, thy brethren, princi|ples tending to repleni&s;h their hearts with goodne&s;s, friend&s;hip and charity towards each other; that thus thou maye&s;t do the utmo&s;t of thy power, to render men rea&s;on|able, u&s;eful, and con&s;equently happy; and more e&s;peci|ally, that thou maye&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly combat that fal&s;e prin|ciple of honour, or rather intolerable pride and folly, which &s;o &s;trongly prevails in our nation, where the mo&s;t indolent and the lea&s;t u&s;eful fancy them&s;elves, and are re|puted the mo&s;t noble. Let us endeavour to make them &s;en&s;ible, that men are noble but in an exact proportion to their being rational. The happine&s;s which is to be found in virtue alone, is &s;ought for by men, through the titles acquired by their fathers, for their activity in tho&s;e wars which have de&s;olated the world, or in the wealth ac|cumulated by their ance&s;tors; two means, generally un|ju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, and con&s;equently rather the &s;ources of &s;hame and humiliation. For, as the Chine&s;e Philo&s;opher well ob&s;erved, <HI>"There is &s;carcely one rich man out of one hundred, who was not him&s;elf an oppre&s;&s;or, or the &s;on of an oppre&s;&s;or."</HI></P>
<P>Let us di&s;play to princes and the rulers of nations the example of <HI>Numa-Pompilius,</HI> who, by a Conduct op|po&s;ite to that of <HI>Romulus,</HI> his predece&s;&s;or, and mo&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, rendered the Romans, during his long reign, &s;o re&s;pectable and happy. Above all, my dear friend, let us repre&s;ent to our compatriots the abominable iniqui|ty of the Guinea trade. Let us put to the blu&s;h the pre|tended di&s;ciples of the benign Saviour of the world, for the encouragement given to the unhappy Africans, in in|vading the liberty of their own brethren. Let us ri&s;e, and ri&s;e with energy, again&s;t the corruption, introduced into the principles and manners of the ma&s;ters and own|ers of &s;laves, by a conduct &s;o contrary to humanity, rea|&s;on and religion. Let us be &s;till more vehement, in re|pre&s;enting its baneful influence on the principles and manners of their wretched offspring, nece&s;&s;arily educated in idlene&s;s, pride, and all the vices to which human na|ture is liable.</P>
<P>How de&s;irable it is that Lewis XVI, who&s;e virtues
<PB N="10" REF="044647_0009_101EC3301D778C70">and good di&s;po&s;itions have been &s;o nobly prai&s;ed, would &s;et an example to the other potentates of Europe, by for|bidding his &s;ubjects to be concerned in a traffick &s;o evil in it&s;elf, and &s;o corrupt in its con&s;equences, and that he would al&s;o i&s;&s;ue out ordinances, in favour of &s;uch of the Negroes who now are &s;laves in his dominions.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;hould Chri&s;tianity, that law of love and cha|rity, work its proper effect on the hearts of its pretended di&s;ciples, we would &s;ee numbers of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> traver&s;e A|frica, and both the Indies, not to pollute them&s;elves with &s;lavery and &s;laughter, nor to accumulate wealth, the &s;u|preme wi&s;h of the pre&s;ent nominal Chri&s;tians; but that Divine love would impel them to vi&s;it remote regions, in order to make the inhabitants acquainted with the cor|ruption of the human heart, and invite them to &s;eek for the influence of that grace, propo&s;ed by the go&s;pel, by which they may obtain &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of concluding ha&s;tily, re|que&s;ting thou would&s;t excu&s;e faults which time does not allow me to correct, and to write to me by various oppor|tunities, the ve&s;&s;els bound to the&s;e parts, often mi&s;&s;ing their de&s;tination.</P>

<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE OPPRESSED AFRICANS.</HEAD>
<P>WE are engaged, under a &s;en&s;e of duty, to bear a public te&s;timony again&s;t a &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion which, under the &s;anction of national authority, has long been exerci&s;ed upon the natives of Africa, is grown up into a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, and is unhappily become a con|&s;iderable branch of the commerce of this kingdom: An oppre&s;&s;ion which, in the inju&s;tice of its origin, and the inhumanity of its progre&s;s, has not, we apprehend, been exceeded, or even equalled, in the mo&s;t barbarous ages.</P>
<P>We are taught, both by the holy &s;criptures, and by the experience of ages, to believe that the Righteous Judge of the whole earth cha&s;ti&s;eth nations for their &s;ins, as well as individuals; and can it be expected that he will &s;uffer this great iniquity to go unpuni&s;hed? As the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of government is for a terror to evil doers, and the prai&s;e of them that do well, we wi&s;h it may be &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;idered, whether this has been made the rule of its admini&s;tration in this land. Will it not rather be found, on inquiry, that, with re&s;pect to the en&s;laved Ne|groes, its benevolent purpo&s;es have been perverted; that
<PB N="12" REF="044647_0011_101EC3332DACCF60">its terrors have fallen on the innocent, while evil doers, and oppre&s;&s;ors, have been openly encouraged?</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding, government, in former times, have been induced by, what we conceive to be a mi&s;taken, as well as an unju&s;t, policy, to promote this evil, we are per&s;uaded that many of the pre&s;ent members of the legi&s;|lature, as true friends of civil and religious liberty, hold this unrighteous traffic in the utmo&s;t abhorrence. This per&s;ua&s;ion, joined to the favourable reception of the peti|tion of our la&s;t Yearly-meeting, to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, encourages us to addre&s;s you, thus freely, on this important &s;ubject; and we apprehend that the abolition of this iniquitous practice is not only required by the calls of ju&s;tice and humanity, but is al&s;o con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy. For avarice in this, as in other in&s;tances, has de|feated its own purpo&s;e. Africa, &s;o populous, and &s;o rich in vegetable and mineral productions, in&s;tead of affording all the advantages of a well regulated commerce, is &s;carce|ly known but as a mart for &s;laves, and as the &s;cene of vio|lence and barbarities, perpetrated, in order to procure them, by men profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>The arguments which have been advanced by the few writers, who have attempted to ju&s;tify this inhuman bu&s;i|ne&s;s, can have no weight with generous minds. Tho&s;e, in particular, which are drawn from the permi&s;&s;ion to hold &s;laves among the Jews, can in no wi&s;e be applied to the practice among&s;t us: For, ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of all our mercies,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 26.</NOTE> who hath made of one blood all nati|ons of men, we now live under a di&s;pen&s;ation e&s;&s;entially different from that of the law; in which many things were permitted to the Jews, becau&s;e of the the hardne&s;s of their hearts. All di&s;tinctions of name and country, &s;o far as they relate to the &s;ocial duties, are now aboli&s;hed.&mdash;We are taught by our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, to look upon all men, even our enemies, as neighbours and brethren, and to do unto them as we would they &s;hould do unto us.</P>
<P>Under a di&s;pen&s;ation &s;o admirably adapted to promote
<PB N="13" REF="044647_0012_101EC3381E249550">the temporal as well as the eternal happine&s;s of mankind, that any &s;hould deviate &s;o far from its principles, as to en|courage a practice &s;o replete with iniquity, and in parti|cular that this nation, generally characterized by its at|tachment to civil and religious liberty, &s;hould have con|tributed, perhaps, more than any other, to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and continuance of &s;lavery, is a mo&s;t painful reflex|ion. It would &s;urely have been more con&s;i&s;tent with the avowed principles of Engli&s;hmen, both as men and as Chri&s;tians, if their &s;ettlement in heathen countries had been &s;ucceeded by mild and benevolent attempts to civil|ize their inhabitants, and to incline them to receive the glad tidings of the go&s;pel. But how different a conduct, towards them, has been pur&s;ued! it has not only been re|pugnant, in a political view, to tho&s;e commercial advan|tages which a fair and honourable treatment might have procured, but has evidently tended to increa&s;e the barba|rity of their manners, and to excite in their minds an aver&s;ion to that religion, the profe&s;&s;ors whereof &s;o cruelly treat them.</P>
<P>This traffic is the principal &s;ource of the de&s;tructive wars which prevail among the&s;e unhappy people, and it is attended with con&s;equences, the mere recital of which is &s;hocking to humanity. The violent &s;eparation of the deare&s;t relatives, the tears of conjugal and parental affec|tion, the reluctance of the &s;laves to a voyage from which they can have no pro&s;pect of returning, mu&s;t pre&s;ent &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which would pierce the heart of any, in whom the principles of humanity are not wholly effaced. This, however, is but the beginning of &s;orrows with the poor captives. Under their cruel treatment on &s;hipboard, where, without regard to health or decency, hundreds are confined within the narrow limits of the hold, num|bers peri&s;h; and, by what is called the &s;ea&s;oning in the i&s;lands, many are relieved by a premature death, from that &s;eries of accumulated &s;ufferings which awaits their le&s;s happy &s;urvivors. The mea&s;ure of their afflictions yet remains to be filled; being &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder, and branded with a hot iron, they have yet to linger on, unpitied, the whole term of their mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, in
<PB N="14" REF="044647_0013_101EC33CE2D37B48">exce&s;&s;ive labour, and too often under the mercile&s;s con|troul of unprincipled and unfeeling men, without proper food or cloathing, or any encouragement to &s;weeten their toil; whil&s;t every fault, real, or imaginary, is puni&s;hed with a rigour which is but weakly re&s;trained by the colo|ny laws; in&s;tances of the greate&s;t enormity, even the mo&s;t wanton or deliberate murder of the &s;laves, being only pu|ni&s;hed, if puni&s;hed at all, by trifling pecuniary fines.</P>
<P>But a bare enumeration of the calamities of this wretch|ed people, would exceed the limits propo&s;ed to this &s;hort addre&s;s: We think it not improper, however, to give the following extract from a late author, who was an eye witne&s;s of the mi&s;eries of this per&s;ecuted race.</P>
<Q><P>If we bring this matter home, and, as Job propo&s;ed to his friends, <HI>"Put our &s;oul in their &s;ouls &s;tead;"</HI> if we con&s;ider our&s;elves, and our children, as expo&s;ed to the hard&s;hips which the&s;e people lie under, in &s;up|porting an imaginary greatne&s;s;</P>
<P>Did we, in &s;uch ca&s;e, behold an increa&s;e of luxury and &s;uperfluity among our oppre&s;&s;ors, and therewith feel an increa&s;e of the weight of our burdens, and ex|pect our po&s;terity to groan under oppre&s;&s;ion after us;</P>
<P>Under all this mi&s;ery, had we none to plead our cau&s;e, nor any hope of relief from man, how would our cries a&s;cend to the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, who judgeth the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and, in his own time, is a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>When we were hunger-bitten, and could not have &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment, but &s;aw them in fullne&s;s, plea&s;ing their ta&s;te with things fetched from far;</P>
<P>When we were wearied with labour, denied the li|berty to re&s;t, and &s;aw them &s;pending their time at ea&s;e; when garments, an&s;werable to our nece&s;&s;ities, were de|nied us, while we &s;aw them cloathed in that which was co&s;tly and delicate?</P>
<P>Under &s;uch affliction, how would the&s;e painful feel|ings ri&s;e up as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t their pretended devoti|on! And if the name of their religion were menti|oned in our hearing, how would it &s;ound in our ears,
<PB N="15" REF="044647_0014_101EC33FB9953DD0">like a word which &s;ignified &s;elf-exaltation and hardne&s;s of heart!</P>
<P>When a trade is carried on productive of &s;o much mi&s;ery, and they who &s;uffer by it are &s;ome thou&s;ands of miles off, the danger is the greater of not laying their &s;ufferings to heart.</P>
<P>In procuring &s;laves from the coa&s;t of Africa, many children are &s;tolen privately; wars al&s;o are encouraged among the Negroes; but all is at a great di&s;tance.&mdash;Many groans ari&s;e from dying men, which we hear not. Many cries are uttered by widows and fatherle&s;s child|ren, which reach not our ears. Many cheeks are wet with tears, and faces &s;ad with unutterable grief, which we &s;ee not. Cruel tyranny is encouraged. The hands of robbers are &s;trengthened; and thou&s;ands reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, who never injured us.</P>
<P>Were we, for the term of one year only, to be eye witne&s;&s;es to what pa&s;&s;eth in getting the&s;e &s;laves; was the blood which is there &s;hed, to be &s;prinkled on our garments; were the poor captives, bound with thongs, heavy laden with elephants teeth, to pa&s;s before our eyes, in their way to the &s;ea;</P>
<P>Were their bitter lamentations, day after day, to ring in our ears, and their mourn&s;ul cries in the night, to hinder us from &s;leeping!</P>
<P>Were we to hear the &s;ound of the tumult, when the &s;laves on board the &s;hips attempt to kill the Engli&s;h, and behold the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e bloody conflicts; what pious man could be a witne&s;s to the&s;e things, and &s;ee a trade carried on in this manner, without being deeply affected with &s;orrow?</P></Q>
<P>Our religious &s;ociety in the&s;e kingdoms, and in North America, have for many years tenderly &s;ympathized with this unhappy people, under their complicated &s;ufferings, and have endeavoured to procure them relief: Nor has their ca&s;e been without other advocates; who&s;e numbers we have with much &s;atisfaction ob&s;erved to increa&s;e. The expectation of many, who are anxiou&s;ly concerned for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this national evil, is now, under Providence, fixed upon the wi&s;e and humane interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;|lature

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE SLAVE TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat what has been &s;o fully declared in &s;everal mo|dern publications, of the incon&s;i&s;tence of &s;la|very with every right of mankind, with e|very feeling of humanity, and every precept of Chri&s;tianity; nor to point out its incon|&s;i&s;tency with the welfare, peace and pro&s;|perity of every country, in proportion as it prevails; what grievous &s;ufferings it brings on the poor NEGROES; but more e&s;pecially what a train of fatal vices it produces in their lordly oppre&s;&s;ors and their unhappy off|&s;pring. Neverthele&s;s for the &s;ake of &s;ome who have not met with, or fully con&s;idered tho&s;e former publications, and in hopes that &s;ome who are &s;till active in &s;upport of &s;lavery may be induced to con&s;ider their ways, and become more wi&s;e, the following &s;ub&s;tance of an addre&s;s or expo&s;tulation made by a &s;en&s;ible Author, to the &s;everal ranks of per|&s;ons mo&s;t immediately concerned in the trade, is now republi&s;hed.</P>
<P>"And fir&s;t, to the Captains employed in this trade. Mo&s;t of you know the country of Guinea, perhaps now by your means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilder|ne&s;s; the inhabitants being murdered or car|ried away, &s;o that there are few left to till

You know the peo|ple were not &s;tupid, not wanting in &s;en&s;e, con&s;idering the few means of improvement they enjoyed. Neither did you find them &s;avage, treacherous, or unkind to &s;trangers. On the contrary they were in mo&s;t parts a &s;en&s;ible and ingenious people; kind and friendly, and generally ju&s;t in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own countrymen to tear away from this lovely country; part by &s;tealth, part by force, part made captives in tho&s;e wars which you rai&s;e or foment on purpo&s;e. You have &s;een them torn away, children from their parents, pa|rents from their children: Hu&s;bands from their wives, wives from their beloved hu&s;|bands; brethren and &s;i&s;ters from each other. You have dragged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their native &s;hore. You have forced them into your &s;hips, like an herd of &s;wine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following relation is in&s;erted at the reque&s;t of the author.</P>
<P><Q>That I may contribute all in my power towards the good of mankind, by in&s;piring any of its individuals with a &s;uit|able abhorrence for that dete&s;table practice of trading in our fellow creatures, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure attone for my neglect of duty as a chri&s;tian, in engaging in a wicked traffic, I offer to their &s;erious con&s;ideration, &s;ome few occurrences of which I was an eye witne&s;s. That being &s;truck with the wretched and affecting &s;cene they may fo&s;ter that humane principle, which is the noble and di&s;tingui&s;hed characteri&s;tic of man.</Q></P>
<P>About the year <HI>1749;</HI> I &s;ailed from Liverpool to the coa&s;t of Gainea, &s;ome time after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, upon having notice from one of the Negroe Kings, that he had a parcel of &s;laves to di&s;|po&s;e of, I received my in&s;tructions and went, carrying with me an account of &s;uch goods we had on board, to exchange for the &s;laves we intended to purcha&s;e; upon being introduced, I pre|&s;ented him with a &s;mall ca&s;e of &s;pirits, a gun and &s;ome trifles, which having accepted. and under&s;tood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the Slaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how &s;hall I relate the affecting fight I there beheld, the &s;ilent &s;orrow which appeared in the countenance of the af|flicted father, and the painful angui&s;h of the tender mother, expecting to be forever &s;eparated from their tender offspring; the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed maid wringing her hands in pre&s;age of her future wretchedne&s;s, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fear|ful apprehen&s;ion of the perpetual Slavery to which they were doomed. I purcha&s;ed eleven, who I conducted, tied two and two, to our &s;hip. Being but a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el (ninety ton) we &s;oon purcha&s;ed our cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and &s;eventy Slaves, whom thou may'&s;t reader range in thy view, as they were &s;hackled two and two together, pent up within the nar|row confines of the main deck, with the complicated di&s;tre&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, chains and contempt; deprived of every fond and &s;o|cial tie and in a great mea&s;ure reduced to a &s;lave of de&s;peration. We had not been a fortnight at &s;ea, before the fatal con&s;e|quence of this de&s;pair appeared, they formed a de&s;ign of reco|vering their natural right, Liberty, by rai&s;ing and murdering every man on board; but the goodne&s;s of the Almighty render|ed their &s;cheme abortive, and his mercy &s;pared us to have time to repent: The plot was di&s;covered; the ring leader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at &s;un ri&s;e received a number of la&s;hes; in this &s;ituation be remained till &s;un-&s;et, expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and barbarity of the brutal crew of &s;ail|ers, with full leave to exerci&s;e their cruelty at plea&s;ure: The con&s;equence was, the next morning the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer was found dead, fleed from the &s;houlders to the wai&s;t. The next victim was a youth, who from too &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of his mi|&s;ery refu&s;ed nouri&s;hment and died di&s;regarded and unnoticed till the hogs had fed on part of his fle&s;h.</P></NOTE> them who
<PB N="3" REF="044647_0018_101EC34CED7279C8">had &s;ouls immortal as your own. You have &s;towed them together as clo&s;e as ever they could lie, without any regard to decency or conveniency&mdash;And when many of them had been poi&s;oned by &s;oul air, or had &s;unk un|der various hard&s;hips, <Q>you have &s;een their remains delivered to the deep, till the &s;ea &s;hould give up his dead.</Q> You have carried the &s;urvivors into the vile&s;t &s;lavery, never to end but with life: Such &s;lavery as is not found among the Turks at Algiers, no, nor among the heathens in America.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="044647_0019_101EC34FD438A6A8">
May I &s;peak plainly to you? I mu&s;t. Love con&s;trains me: Love to you, as well, as tho&s;e you are concerned with. Is there a God? You know there is. Is he a ju&s;t God? Then there mu&s;t be a &s;tate of retribution: A &s;tate where|in the ju&s;t God will reward every man ac|cording to his work. Then what reward will he render to you. O think betimes! be|fore you drop into eternity: Think how, <Q>He &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that &s;hewed no mercy.</Q> Are you a man? Then you &s;hould have a human heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made
<PB N="5" REF="044647_0020_101EC35173367170">of? Is there no &s;uch principle as compa&s;&s;ion there? Do you never feel another's pain? Have you no &s;ympathy? No &s;en&s;e of human woe? No pity for the mi&s;erable? When you &s;aw the flowing eyes, the heaving bre&s;t, or the bleeding &s;ides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures. Was you a &s;tone or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you &s;queezed the a|gonizing creatures down in the &s;hip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the &s;ea, had you no relentings? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one &s;igh e|&s;cape from your brea&s;t? Do you feel no re|lenting now? If you do not, you mu&s;t go on till the mea&s;ure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great God deal with you, as you have dealt with them, and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for you: But if your heart does relent; tho' in a &s;mall degree, know it: is a call from the God of Love. And to-day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart&mdash;To day re&s;olve, God being your helper to e&s;cape for your life&mdash;Regard not money: All that a man hath will he give for his life. Whatever you lo&s;e, lo&s;e not your &s;oul; nothing can countervail that lo&s;e.
<PB N="6" REF="044647_0021_101EC354034E7750">Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events be an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>This equally concerns every merchant who is engaged in the &s;lave-trade. It is you that induce the African villain to &s;ell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to &s;teal, rob, murder men, women and children without number: by enabling the Engli&s;h villain to pay him for &s;o doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is your money, that is the &s;pring of all, that improw|ers him to go on, &s;o that whatever he or the African does in this matter, is all your act and deed. And is your con&s;cience quite re|conciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes and &s;tupified your heart? Can you &s;ee, can you feel no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the ca&s;e your own. <Q>Ma&s;ter (&s;aid a &s;lave at Liverpool to the merchant that owned him) what if &s;ome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my mi&s;tre&s;s, and ma&s;ter Tommy and ma&s;ter Billy, and carry them into our country and make them &s;laves, how would you like it?</Q> His an&s;wer was worthy of a man: <Q>I will never buy a &s;lave more while I live.</Q> O let his re&s;olution be yours! Have no more any part in this
<PB N="7" REF="044647_0022_101EC35D6B8D1BE0">dete&s;table bu&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tantly leave it to tho&s;e unfeeling wretches, <Q>who laugh at humanity and compa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>And this equally concerns every per&s;on who has an e&s;tate in our American plantati|ons: Yea all &s;lave-holders of whatever rank and degree; &s;eeing men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-&s;tealers. Indeed you &s;ay, <Q>I pay hone&s;tly for my goods; and I am not concerned to know how they are come by.</Q> Nay but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know that they are not &s;tolen: Otherwi&s;e you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot hone&s;ter than him. But you know they are not hone&s;tly come by: You know they are procured by means nothing near &s;o innocent as picking of pock|ets, hou&s;e breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are procured by a deliberate &s;eries of more complicated vil|lainy (of fraud, robbery and murder) than was ever practi&s;ed either by Mahometans or Pagans; in particular by murders of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is your money that pays the merchant, and thro' him the captain and African butchers. You therefore are guilty: Yea principally guilty, of all the&s;e frauds, robberies, and murders. You are the &s;pring that puts all the re&s;t in
<PB N="8" REF="044647_0023_101EC35EF0923828">motion; they would not &s;tir a flep without you&mdash;There|fore the blood of all the&s;e wretches, who die before their time, whether in their country or el&s;ewhere, lies upon your head. The blood of thy brother, (for whether thou wilt believe it or no, &s;uch he is in the &s;ight of him that made him) crieth again&s;t thee from the earth, from the &s;hip and from the waters. O! whatever it co&s;t, put a &s;top to its cry, before it be too late. In&s;tantly, at any price, were it the half of thy goods, deliver thy &s;elf from blood guiltine&s;s! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy hou&s;e, thy land, are at pre&s;ent &s;tained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt: Spill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to &s;hed blood! Do not pay him for doing it! Whether thou art a Chri&s;tian or no, &s;hew thy &s;elf a man; be not more &s;avage than a lion or a bear.</P>
<P>Perhaps thou wilt &s;ay, <Q>I do not buy any NEGROES: I only u&s;e tho&s;e left me by my father.</Q> But is it enough to &s;atisfy your own con&s;cience! Had your father, have you, has any man living, a right to u&s;e another as a Slave? It cannot be, even &s;etting REVELATION a&s;ide. It cannot be, that either war, or contract, can give any man &s;uch a property in another as he has in his &s;heep and oxen: Much le&s;s is it po&s;&s;ible, that any child of man, &s;hould ever be born a Slave. Liberty is the right of every human creature, as &s;oon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he de|rives from the law of nature. If therefore you have any regard to ju&s;tice, (to &s;ay nothing of mercy, nor of the re|vealed law of GOD) render unto all their due. Give Li|berty to whom Liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none &s;erve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice, away with whips, chains, and all compul&s;ion. Be gentle towards all men. And &s;ee that you invariably do unto every one, as you would he &s;hould do unto you.</P>
