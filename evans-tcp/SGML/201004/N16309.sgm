<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of the following E&s;&s;ay, as repre&s;ented in general terms, in the beginning of it, did, in the view of the Church affected by it, call for very &s;erious and deliber|ate con&s;ideration; that they might be clear to di&s;charge them|&s;elves, as the nature and importance of the ca&s;e required; and &s;o as they might be acquitted in the day of account.</P>
<P>They con&s;idered the two per&s;ons referred to, as practi&s;ing contempt of the &s;acred ordinance of bapti&s;m in their childhood; which bapti&s;m is certainly vindicable from the &s;criptures; whether the following E&s;&s;ay &s;hall be con&s;idered as having done it, or not. They con&s;idered them al&s;o, as violating their &s;olemn faederal connection with this Church, to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to which, they were holden, as well as to union with it. Al&s;o, tho&s;e per&s;ons appeared to look down on the various lenient mea|&s;ures of the Church towards them, contemptuou&s;ly. But as they alledged con&s;cience for what they did, &s;o the Church con|&s;idered the ca&s;e, as wholly out of their power. Yet viewed the per&s;ons as going a &s;tray, and that the end would be bitter|ne&s;s, when all di&s;gui&s;es &s;hall be removed. The Church there|fore were at a plunge, being &s;harply pinched, between &s;ympa|thetic feelings for their old friends, and a pre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of duty lying on them, to do &s;omething. Of cour&s;e, con&s;idering the evidence they had, that Bapti&s;ts proceed in an un&s;criptural way, and the po&s;&s;ibility that pertinent light might tend to extricate tho&s;e per&s;ons from their pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments, and be of u&s;e to others in like temptation; and at the &s;ame time be a di&s;|charge of duty for them&s;elves; they determined to exhibit as clear an account as they could, of the nature of the bapti&s;m which was u&s;ed by <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, under the law; as al&s;o
<PB N="4" REF="020921_0003_0FB14D3A6E7284A8">of the bapti&s;m appointed to be u&s;ed under the go&s;pel. And they were di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;ire their Pa&s;tor to prepare tho&s;e exhi|bitions for public view. He was &s;en&s;ible of his in&s;ufficiency to do honour to tho&s;e important topics, together with his daily avoca|tions and incumbrances, would nece&s;&s;arily confine him to the ve|ry &s;horte&s;t method of treating tho&s;e points. And when he con|&s;idered the people, who&s;e benefit he had in view, were not able or di&s;po&s;ed to comprehend large treati&s;es, he judged it was be&s;t for them to give as &s;hort &s;ketches on each head, as could con&s;i&s;t with &s;ome mea&s;ure of light, in the nature of it. However, he fore&s;aw &s;ome di&s;advantages in &s;o brief a manner of treating the &s;criptural doctrines of bapti&s;m; both becau&s;e many intere&s;ting points could not be, in that way, &s;o di&s;tinctly illu&s;trated or prov|ed; and becau&s;e the cla&s;s of people, to whom he would feign communicate &s;ome light, are as apt to harp on a &s;uppo&s;ed defect, as they are aver&s;e to feel and yield to a fair demon&s;tration. On the whole, as the Church held them&s;elves di&s;qualified to pa&s;s cen|&s;ure, for the rea&s;on already given; though they know that no con&s;cience ever dictated, what is not &s;criptural, either materi|ally or in made of management. Of cour&s;e they held, that the ca&s;e before them mu&s;t be refered to the Lord of all con&s;ciences; and that they who charge to con&s;cience any other kind of influ|ence, or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>And the Church were equally barred from approving the &s;aid two per&s;ons, in their conduct, either by neglect, indiffer|ence or &s;ilence; becau&s;e in either they would injure known truth; &s;o they held, them&s;elves confined to the pre&s;ent method.</P>
<P>The writer of the following E&s;&s;ay is &s;en&s;ible, that the gen|eral repre&s;entation he has given of the covenant of grace, is not exactly agreeable to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who conceive of a covenant of redemption, between the Father and the Son, di&s;|tinct from the covenant of grace; and who conceive man a party in the covenant of grace. He rather thinks, with ma|ny others, who &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding a di&s;tinct cove|nant of redemption; but that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the &s;econd Ad|am, undertook the &s;alvation of the elect from eternity; was &s;ole party contractor for them, without any actual pardon or
<PB N="5" REF="020921_0004_0FB14D3BE886E890">ju&s;tification granted to them, as not yet exi&s;ting, till faith and repentance &s;hould open a door, for the con&s;i&s;tent di&s;play of &s;uch acts of grace upon them. Other &s;entiments in the E&s;&s;ay, may be charged to the writer's account; but he hopes none offen|&s;ive to the generation of God's children, who&s;e hearts are found in his &s;tatutes, nor un&s;upportable by the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The writer found it nearly impo&s;&s;ible for him to avoid &s;ay|ing the &s;ame things, in &s;ome parts of the E&s;&s;ay, which have been &s;aid by others on the &s;ame &s;ubject; however, he has been dictated by the &s;criptures, and the nature of the argument.</P>
<P>He begs leave to in&s;i&s;t on two points, from every reader of the following E&s;&s;ay, viz. to read attentively every article, with the evidence adduced to &s;upport it: and to &s;u&s;pend cen&s;ure till be is &s;ure of the &s;entiment; for if the &s;entiments are contained in truth, they claim all this as due; but if not, cen&s;ure is a ju&s;t reward.</P>
<P>N. B. The &s;aid Church al&s;o thought it a proper part of the following te&s;timony, to add a number of marks of a wrong &s;ort of religious &s;pirit, in whom&s;oever they are found. As

<HEAD>An ESSAY ON OUTWARD CHRISTIAN BAPTISM. In two PARTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The fir&s;t PART, on the BAPTISM u&s;ed under the Law.</HEAD>
<P>THE judgment of a Church in Hamp&s;hire county, in the ca&s;e of two per&s;ons, who have heretofore profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;tian faith, and &s;ubmitted to the gov|ernment, watch and care of &s;aid Church, and &s;o be|came divinely bound to keep the unity of the &s;pi|rit in the bond of peace with it.</P>
<P>And yet paying no regard to tho&s;e &s;acred bonds, have of late, in a di&s;orderly manner, withdrawn them|&s;elves from all connection with &s;aid Church, not on|ly without its council and concurrence, but contrary to its painful labours and faithful remon&s;trances, and unit|ed them&s;elves to what is called a Bapti&s;t Church.</P>
<P>And now &s;aid Church, &s;till meaning to practi&s;e fi|delity to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and them; in con&s;ideration of the premi&s;es; in con&s;ideration al&s;o of the noted habit of the people called <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> to criminate all oppo&s;ition to their bias, with the &s;tyle of per&s;ecution; and la&s;tly, in con&s;ideration of the utter incon&s;i&s;tency of their &s;cheme, with that of the bible; the &s;aid Church holds it&s;elf called to exhibit &s;criptural light to the &s;aid two per&s;ons, and to whom&s;oever el&s;e it may concern; in
<PB N="8" REF="020921_0007_0FB14D4066396A68">con&s;idence, that when their minds are di&s;entangled from the bondage of errour, as they certainly will be in this ca&s;e, they will then know we have treated them in con|&s;i&s;tency with our &s;table profe&s;&s;ion: and then we &s;hall leave the &s;aid two per&s;ons entirely to the Judge of right.</P>
<P>Now as the people called <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> hold it a nece&s;&s;ary part of obedience and following Chri&s;t, to be buried in water, as they &s;ay he was in bapti&s;in: We therefore are bound to te&s;tify and prove,</P>
<P N="1">I. That Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, was not chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is a &s;eal of chri&s;tianity; but the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation was not in being when Je|&s;us Chri&s;t was baptized, and &s;o there was no &s;uch thing to be &s;ealed at that time; and then it mu&s;t be a &s;eal to nothing, which is no &s;eal at all. Therefore the bap|ti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not the chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was under the law; but no ordinance under the law, could at the &s;ame time be under the go&s;pel; and if not under the go&s;pel, it could not be a chri&s;tian ordinance: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was not chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was part of that law-righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he came to fulfil, and which mu&s;t be fini&s;hed before the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation could begin; as ju&s;tification mu&s;t be fini&s;hed before &s;anctification can begin: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m could not be chri&s;tian bapti&s;m,</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e as every thing done to fulfil the law was legal, and as Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was confe&s;&s;edly done to fulfil the law; Matt. iii. 15,&mdash;therefore Chri&s;t's bap|ti&s;m was legal, not chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e to be baptized in obedience to the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, mu&s;t be legal obedience; but Chri&s;t was &s;o baptzied: therefore his bapti&s;m was legal, not go&s;|pel obedience.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e what Chri&s;t came to do was to fulfil the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, Matt. v. 17. But that was law-work, not go&s;pel-work: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was legal, not evangelical.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="9" REF="020921_0008_0FB14D41E7756120">
7. Ordinances of the law, and of the go&s;pel, are dif|ferent; but Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was an ordinance of the law, as the next argument will &s;hew: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was not a go&s;pel or chri&s;tian ordinance.</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> But the Lord's &s;upper was in&s;tituted un|der the law al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> True; but it was the very night in which he was betrayed, &s;o it mu&s;t be then or never, I. Cor. xi. 23. Whereas Chri&s;t was baptized &s;everal years be|fore. Be&s;ide, he commanded the future con&s;tant u&s;e of the Lord's &s;upper; but no &s;uch command about his bapti&s;m, becau&s;e that was part of his perfect law, right|eou&s;ne&s;s, which none ever could do but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nay further, Je&s;us Chri&s;t knew that he was appoint|ed by the Father to be faithful in all God's hou&s;e, the church, as Mo&s;es was,&mdash;Heb. iii. 2 But Mo&s;es ap|pointed the Pa&s;chal fea&s;t, as a con&s;tant token of di|vine pre&s;ence and favour, and a mean of communion with him, which Pa&s;chal fea&s;t was to cea&s;e the moment Chri&s;t died. Therefore he mu&s;t appoint the go&s;pel fea&s;t, the Lord's &s;upper, before he died, or el&s;e he would not be as faithful in God's hou&s;e, as Mo&s;es was; but would leave it quite de&s;titute of this chie&s;mean of vi&s;i|ble connection and communion with God; which would &s;how he had not fini&s;hed his work, and be a blot on him and his kingdom forever.</P>
<P N="2">II. The bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was the appointed mean of entering on his publie mini&s;try, which he mu&s;t fulfil, both as it was a part of the law, which he was to obey perfectly, and al&s;o, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e he could not claim that prie&s;thood all to him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. Legal prie&s;ts were always inducted to their pub|lic mini&s;try, by wa&s;hing or being baptized with water; therefore it was commanded for <HI>Aaron,</HI> his &s;ons and all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to be wa&s;hed, or baptized with water, when they went into their public mini&s;try,&mdash;Exod. xxix. 4, xl. 12.&mdash;Exod. 30.18.&mdash;20. So Chri&s;t, who knew the whole law, when he was going into his public di&s;charge of the legal prie&s;thood, knew he mu&s;t be wa&s;hed or baptized with water; and as no legal prie&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="020921_0009_0FB14D4378DBEC68">could enter that public mini&s;try, till thirty years of age, &mdash;Num. iv. 3, 47,&mdash;&s;o Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he arrived to that age&mdash;Luke iii. 23&mdash;knowing it was the ap|pointed mean of entering the mini&s;try of the law, was obedient in that, as in every thing: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was wholly legal, not chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is exactly the rea&s;on which Je&s;us Chri&s;t gives to <HI>John,</HI> when he come to be wa&s;hed or baptized by him; <HI>"thus it becomes us to fulfil all rightou&s;ne&s;s."</HI> Im|porting I can't fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s, viz. of the law, unle&s;s I &s;ubmit to it; nor you do your duty unle&s;s you admini&s;ter it; for this was the rea&s;on why <HI>John</HI> was &s;ent to baptize&mdash;And as this was a noted part of obedience to the law, &s;o all righteou&s;ne&s;s could not be fulfiled with|out it: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was not chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is declared, John i. 31, &amp;c. that the very rea|&s;on why <HI>John</HI> was &s;ent to baptize, was, that he might by that ordinance make Chri&s;t manife&s;t to I&s;rael, viz. to be their promi&s;ed high prie&s;t; and he was made mani&s;e&s;t by public bapti&s;m, according to law, by the heaven's vi&s;ibly opening at the &s;ame time; by the de|&s;cent of the holy &s;pirit on Chri&s;t, and by the voice from heaven approving him. Therefore as &s;oon as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary trials of forty days in the wilderne&s;s were out, he began to preach. Matt. iv. 17. Therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was altogether legal, not chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">III. The bapti&s;m of Ju&s;us Chri&s;t was no part of chri&s;tian obedience. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Then it mu&s;t be obedience to him&s;elf; for Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is the head of all chri&s;tian matters. He came to do the will of God, P&s;al. xl. 8, not to do his own will, John vi. 38. But the will of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, primarily, was his fulfiling the law, and his bap|ti&s;m was part of that work, as he told <HI>John</HI> at the time: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was obedience to the law, not to chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="2">2. To be chri&s;tian obedience, it mu&s;t be under chri&s;tianity, not under the law; but it was under the
<PB N="11" REF="020921_0010_0FB14D44F7C07600">law, not under the go&s;pel: therefore the bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was wholly legal obedience, not chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not only the fact was under the law, but the view and de&s;ign of it was to fulfil what the law already re|quired, and to be a lawful qualification for his public mini&s;try while under the law; the la&s;t act of which mini&s;try and prie&s;thood, was his offering up him&s;elf in death, Heb. viii. 3, 7, 27. Therefore the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was altogether legal, and peculiar to him&s;elf; which was implied, when he &s;aid, <HI>"&s;uffer it to be &s;o now,"</HI> Matt. iii. 15, as the only in&s;tance of it in the world.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m could not be a pattern for his people's obedience. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Obedience to the law for ju&s;tification, never can be a part of his people's obedience: But Chri&s;t's bap|ti&s;m was a part of his obedience to the law, for the ju&s;|tification of &s;inners: therefore no pattern for his peo|ple's obedience.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was pattern for his people to copy, then there mu&s;t be a law in chri&s;tianity for his people to be baptized as he was; but there is no &s;uch law: therefore Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m was not a pattern for them to follow.</P>
<P N="3">3. Therefore there is no more rea&s;on to follow Chri&s;t in this action, than in all the actions of his obedience to the holy law.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> What was <HI>John's</HI> bapti&s;m?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer. John's</HI> bapti&s;m was a rite which divine wi&s;|dom de&s;igned and proclaimed by <HI>Malachy</HI> of old, Mal. iii. 1, which was to &s;erve three purpo&s;es.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>John</HI> was a pioneer and herald, &s;ent before his General, and the following chri&s;tian army, to remove impediments; and as &s;in was the chief impediment, &s;o <HI>John's</HI> work was to witne&s;s again&s;t it, and require re|pentance of it; and then to baptize, or wa&s;h with wa|ter, all who complied, as a badge of their clearne&s;s from it; ju&s;t as Jews always did to pro&s;elytes and prie&s;ts, under the law, as token of their purity. But now <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="020921_0011_0FB14D4686980CA0">did this to all penitents, both becau&s;e God ordered him &s;o, and becau&s;e the holy chri&s;tian kingdom was then coming, in three or four years: &s;o it was called the bapti&s;m of repentance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As <HI>John's</HI> mini&s;try was all under the law, &s;o it was a type, like other religious actions, under the law; to be a picture of that holine&s;s, which was to be character|i&s;tic of approaching chri&s;tianity; that every body might &s;ee in that &s;ymbol, what they mu&s;t be and what Chri&s;t could make them, viz. all over holy: But no u&s;e for types when the &s;ub&s;tance is come, except among Jews.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As Chri&s;t could not enter on his public mini&s;try without bapti&s;m, and it could not be admini&s;tered with|out a qualified officer; &s;o, John i. 31, tells us the ve|ry rea&s;on why <HI>John</HI> was qualified, was that he might introduce Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his public mini&s;try under the law, by the bapti&s;m of that di&s;pen&s;ation.</ITEM>

I. I &s;hall very briefly open the nature of that cove|nant of grace, through which all goods as &s;uch, derive to man. But,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If all men are &s;inners, then divine ju&s;tice for|bids all favours to them, except on &s;uppo&s;ition of e|qual atonement; but all men are &s;inners, and there|fore the ju&s;tice of God forbids all favour to them, ex|cept on &s;uppo&s;ition of equal atonement. Rom. iii. 23. <HI>"All have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God,"</HI> and Jer. v. 25, <HI>"Your &s;ins have withholden good things from you."</HI> But &s;ince mercy and truth have found a|tonement, and <HI>"righteou&s;ne&s;s is come down from heaven, the Lord will give that which is good,"</HI> P&s;al. lxxxv. 10, 11, 12.</P>
<P N="2">2d. But the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, could not con&s;i&s;tent|ly undertake the work of atonement, without expre&s;s &s;ecurity to be pre&s;erved through, accepted and &s;uffi|ciently rewarded; therefore when the determination of the Father, was to give his &s;on <HI>"a covenant of the people,"</HI> I&s;a. xlix. 8. Je&s;us Chri&s;t replied, <HI>"Lo I come, I delight to do thy will, O my God,"</HI> P&s;al. xl. 7, 8. And for his &s;ecurity, God &s;aid, I&s;a. xlii. 6, <HI>"I have called thee in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee.</HI> And promi&s;ed <HI>"he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;eed, and the ends of the earth &s;hould &s;ee his &s;alvation; that he &s;hould &s;ay to the pri&s;oners, go forth,"</HI> &amp;c. I&s;a. xlix. 6, 9: So that there was a com|pleat &s;tipulation or contract, between the Father and Son, with reference to the elect of God.</P>
<P>This contract is commonly &s;tyled the covenant of grace. On which remark,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. This covenant is called, <HI>covenant of grace,</HI> or mere favour, becau&s;e the heart of the parties contracting fir&s;t gave &s;pring to the &s;cheme of it, Cant. vi. 12.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Becau&s;e their object, <HI>lo&s;t &s;inners,</HI> de&s;erved no fa|vour at all. <HI>"They had de&s;troyed them&s;elves, but in God was their help,"</HI> Ho&s;. xiii. 9.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. Becau&s;e it contains all grace, for time and eter|nity, without money or price, I&s;a. lii. 3.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. Becau&s;e the parties contracting, knew they ne|ver
<PB N="14" REF="020921_0013_0FB14D497441F9B8">could need any thing from the creatures. God &s;aid <HI>"I am God, I will take no bullock of thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but will &s;hew the &s;alvation of God,</HI> P&s;al. l. 7, 9, 23.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. As nothing can be new to God, &s;o 'tis evident this covenant was made from eternity, Tit. i. 2, <HI>"It was promi&s;ed,</HI> viz. in Chri&s;t, <HI>before the world began."</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6th. The parties contracting were God the Father, of the one part, and God the Son, as accepting the hu|man nature God provided, on the other; and without which it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould make atonement. P&s;al. xl. 6. Heb. x. 5. <HI>"This councel of peace was be|tween them both,"</HI> Zech. vi. 13.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7th. Therefore the covenant of grace, is as nece&s;&s;ari|ly (by divine appointment) infallible, unchangeable and eternal, as God him&s;elf is. <HI>"'Tis the covenant which God always remembers; the word which he has commanded to a thou&s;and generations,"</HI> P&s;al. cv. 8.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And this gives us light in &s;everal texts of &s;cripture, as P&s;al. lxxxix. 3, <HI>"I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en.</HI> And, II. Tim. i. 9, <HI>This was his own purpo&s;e and grace, given us in Chri&s;t, before the world began.</HI> So al&s;o, P&s;al. xxv. 14, <HI>"The &s;ecret of the Lord,</HI> i. e. his free love and favour, <HI>is with them who fear him, and he will make them know his covenant."</HI> For <HI>Abraham,</HI> as having the &s;ecret of the Lord with him eminently, had this covenant notably e&s;tabli&s;hed with him, Gen. xvii. 7. On the &s;ame account, God made <HI>I&s;aac</HI> know his covenant, Gen. xvii. 19. And in the &s;ame way it was revealed to <HI>Jacob,</HI> I. Chron. xvi. 15, 16, 17. And God has to this day made all know his covenant, who were govern|ed by its principle, for <HI>"his &s;ecret is always with the right|eous,</HI> Prov. iii. 32.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> When God &s;ays, <HI>"I give thee for a cove|nant of the people,"</HI> mu&s;t we under&s;tand that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is him&s;elf the covenant of grace?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> By no means. 'Tis as ab&s;urd to hold Je|&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf to be the covenant of grace, as to hold a trea&s;urer to be the trea&s;ury it&s;elf. Or a te&s;tator to be his own te&s;tament. Or, an admini&s;trator to be
<PB N="15" REF="020921_0014_0FB14D4AFAB845B8">the admini&s;tration it&s;elf. The whole nature of the two parties to whom the covenant of grace has re&s;pect, is in Chri&s;t, and he has full power of &s;ole admini&s;tration of it. For <HI>"in his hand was the plea&s;ure of the Lord to pro&s;|per,"</HI> I&s;a. liii. 10. 'Tis therefore amazing! that any man endowed with common &s;en&s;e, and privileged with the bible, &s;hould ever imagine, that the covenant of grace is not from eternity; or that it is po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubject to in|termi&s;&s;ion or failure, in whole or in any part, touching any of its &s;ubjects, in any re&s;pect whatever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But don't the covenant of works interfere with the covenant of grace?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not at all. Their agreements and differences are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. They agree, in that their preceptive part con|taining all the laws of the bible; and their promi&s;&s;ory part, including all the goods of promi&s;es; and their pe|nal part, containing all the executions again&s;t &s;in, are the &s;ame in both. And they agree al&s;o that perfect conformity to the precept, is the only qualification for the promi&s;e; and that the want of it, induces the exe|cution of the cur&s;e. They both run through all ages, ju&s;t as do the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. And all human per&s;ons in the world, are now &s;ubject to the one or the other. But,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. Tho&s;e two covenants e&s;&s;entially differ, in the following re&s;pects.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. The covenant of grace is coeval with God, and the other is coeval with men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. They differ e&s;&s;entially in their &s;everal head&s;hips. For in the covenant of works, the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was foeder|al head. Therefore <HI>in Adam, all die,</HI> I. Cor. xv. 22. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;ole head in the covenant of grace: therefore <HI>"in him all its &s;ubjects are made alive,</HI> I. Cor. xv. 22.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. The parties contracting in each are different; for in the covenant of works, <HI>Adam</HI> contracted for all his po&s;terity. So Rom. v. 19, &s;ays, <HI>"By his di&s;obe|dience many were made &s;inners"</HI> But in the covenant of grace, Je&s;us Chri&s;t contracted for all the elect; &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="020921_0015_0FB14D4C9EE6FAF0"><HI>"grace reigns thro' righteou&s;ne&s;s to them all."</HI> Rom v. 17 to 21.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. They differ as to the ground of claims on the promi&s;e; for in the covenant of works, each candidate claims on the foot of his own performance of the pre|cept: But never &s;o in the covenant of grace. For there every claim is made on account of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's performance of all the precepts. 'Tis <HI>"for his righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake only, God is well plea&s;ed,"</HI> I&s;a. xlii. 21.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5th. Though neither of the&s;e covenants admit any plea, but perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet the covenant of grace admits tho&s;e to u&s;e it &s;ucce&s;sfully who have no righte|ou&s;ne&s;s at all per&s;onally. In this way, <HI>"he who hath no money may come, buy and eat,</HI> I&s;ai. lv. 1.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Doth not this doctrine injure morality, by en|couraging neglect of duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Right the rever&s;e; it di&s;courages proud arro|gance; but gives infinite encouragement to humble duty and obedience. Rom. iii. 31, <HI>"Do we then make void the law, thro' faith, God forbid, yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the law."</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I am next to prove, that this was the covenant e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Abraham.</HI> This indeed is evident from what has been already &s;aid. But,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. If <HI>Abraham</HI>'s &s;eed, named in the covenant made with him, implies chri&s;tians, then that covenant was the covenant of grace: But <HI>&s;eed</HI> in <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant, implies chri&s;tians: therefore the covenant made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> was the covenant of grace. For God him|&s;elf has told us, Gal. iii. 29, <HI>"If ye are Chri&s;t's, then are ye</HI> Abraham's <HI>&s;eed."</HI> And &s;peaking of the &s;ame co|venant, God a&s;&s;ures his people in all ages, I&s;a. liv. 9, 10, <HI>"It never &s;hould be removed from them."</HI></P>
<P N="2">2d. If by <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith,</HI> Rom. iv. 11, is meant the covenant of grace, then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace; but <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith,</HI> in Rom. iv. 11, doth as evidently mean the covenant of grace, as that &s;aving faith, and its perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, are the peculiars of that covenant. But then 'tis ju&s;t &s;o cer|tain that the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace: For it was <HI>Abraham</HI> who received circumci|&s;ion,
<PB N="17" REF="020921_0016_0FB14D4DF824AA58">as the initiating &s;ign and confirming &s;eal of the covenant made with him; which as it contained the &s;um of all grace, <HI>I will be thy God,"</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t be that covenant through which only grace flows to men.</P>
<P N="3">3d. If the mere mercy of God is equally the &s;ource and fountain of the covenant of grace, and the cove|nant with <HI>Abraham;</HI> then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace: but 'tis as certain to be &s;o, as that both covenants contained good things for the unworthy; and that there is no other fountain, whence to derive them. Of cour&s;e, the covenant with <HI>Abra|ham</HI> was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Gal. iii. 6, &s;ays, <HI>"The promi&s;es of the bible were made to</HI> Abraham <HI>and his &s;eed.</HI> But the promi&s;es of the bible contain all grace revealed; either therefore, the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace, or there is no &s;uch covenant.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The &s;criptures never &s;peak of more than one covenant of grace; but a covenant of grace was certain|ly made with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed. Gen. xvii. 7, <HI>"I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee, for an everla&s;ting covenant, to be a God unto thee and thy &s;eed after thee."</HI> Therefore the covenant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> was the one only covenant of grace, which runs through the whole bible.</P>
<P N="6">6th. If Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the very &s;eed of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant, as Gal. iii. 16, &s;ays, <HI>"and to thy &s;eed which is Chri&s;t,"</HI> then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the cove|nant of grace.</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> The covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was to &s;ecure temporal things, as a numerous po&s;terity, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land of Canaan.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The&s;e things were examples and &s;hadows of heavenly things, Heb. viii. 5. His numerous po&s;ter|ity, repre&s;ented that multitude which no man could number, Rev. vii. 9. For they who are Chri&s;t's are <HI>Abraham's</HI> &s;eed, Gal. iii. 29. And the earthly Canaan, repre&s;ented that better country, even the heavenly, which they de&s;ired. Heb. xi. 14, 15, 16. But if the
<PB N="18" REF="020921_0017_0FB14D4F93E1C090">antitypes of tho&s;e temporary figures, were mo&s;t gracious things: then the covenant by which they were &s;ecured, was the covenant of grace, by which all good things are &s;ecured to its &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="7">7th. If God never publi&s;hed but one &s;y&s;tem of gra|cious promi&s;es, and the&s;e <HI>Abraham</HI> received, Heb. xi. 17. Gal. iii. 16, then 'tis certain that the covenant which contains all gracious promi&s;es, was the covenant made with <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8th. If no per&s;on has ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, but through the covenant of grace; and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> had ju&s;tification and &s;alvation through the covenant made with him; Gal. iii. 18, <HI>"For God gave the inheritance to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promi&s;e;"</HI> then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the &s;ame covenant, by which ju&s;tification and &s;al|vation are received by all who are &s;aved.</P>
<P N="9">9th. If the words promi&s;e, promi&s;es, &amp;c. very often u&s;ed in the in&s;pired writings, generally mean <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant, then <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant is the covenant of grace. But tho&s;e words generally mean <HI>Abraham's</HI> co|venant. For in&s;tance, Rom. iv. 13, 14, <HI>"For the promi&s;e was not to</HI> Abraham, <HI>or to his &s;eed, through the law, but through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith.</HI> So Gal. iii. 18, <HI>If the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promi&s;e, but God gave it to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promi&s;e.</HI> Al&s;o Heb. vi. 13, <HI>when God made promi&s;e to</HI> Abraham, <HI>he &s;ware by him&s;elf, &s;aying, ble&s;&s;ing I will ble&s;s thee,"</HI> &amp;c. which are the very words of <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant. Gen. xxii. 16, 17, 18. There|fore the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="10">10th. If heir&s;hip, often mentioned in the new te&s;ta|ment, as predicable equally of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and of all chri&s;tians, implies title to the covenant of grace, then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace; but heir&s;hip in the new te&s;tament implies title to the covenant of grace; therefore the covenant with <HI>Abra|ham</HI> was the covenant of grace. For Rom. iv. 13, &s;ays, "Abraham <HI>became heir of the world;"</HI> i. e. not only en|titled to Canaan, but a father to all who believe every where, <HI>"through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith;"</HI> i. e. through
<PB N="19" REF="020921_0018_0FB14D50F4E970D0">the covenant of grace. So Gal. iii. 29, <HI>"If ye are Chri&s;t's, then are ye</HI> Abraham's <HI>&s;eed, and heirs according to the pro|mi&s;e;"</HI> i. e. according to the covenant made with <HI>Abra|ham.</HI> So al&s;o Heb. xi. 9, <HI>"By faith</HI> Abraham <HI>&s;o journ|ed with</HI> I&s;aac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>heirs with him of the &s;ame promi&s;e,"</HI> or covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="11">11th. If inheritance, in the &s;en&s;e of the bible, implies intere&s;t in the covenant of grace, then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his &s;eed, was the covenant of grace; but inheritance, in the &s;en&s;e of the bible, implies inter|e&s;t in the covenant of grace, I. Pet. i. 4, <HI>He hath begot|ten us to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away."</HI> And yet &s;uch inherritance God gave to <HI>Abraham,</HI> in the covenant made with him. Gal. iii. 18, <HI>"God gave the inheritance to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promi&s;e."</HI> Therefore the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="12">12th. If there is no &s;alvation but through the cove|nant of grace, then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace; but there is no &s;alvation except through the covenant of grace. Acts iv. 12, <HI>"There is no other name under heaven, whereby ye can be &s;aved."</HI> Yet <HI>Abraham</HI> had &s;alvation, for the beggar was carried to <HI>Abraham's</HI> bo&s;om; Luke xvi. 22. Therefore the co|venant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="13">13th. If &s;aving faith is always grounded on the cove|nant of grace, and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> had &s;uch faith, then the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="14">14th. If the people of God were all &s;aved for two thou&s;and years, viz. from <HI>Abraham</HI> to Chri&s;t, in the faith of <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant, then <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant was the covenant of grace, the only &s;tanding way of &s;alvation; but the people of God for two thou&s;and years, viz. from <HI>Abraham</HI> to Chri&s;t, were &s;aved through faith in <HI>Abraham's</HI> covenant; it was by &s;uch &s;aith <HI>"the elders obtained a good report,"</HI> Heb. xi. 2. And the 13th ver&s;e &s;ays, <HI>"The&s;e all died in faith, not having received the promi&s;es,"</HI> i. e. not living to the outward e&s;tabli&s;hment of chri&s;tianity. Yet <HI>"God was not a&s;hamed to be called their covenant God,&mdash;and pre|pared
<PB N="20" REF="020921_0019_0FB14D5280EA0A10">for them a city.</HI> So &s;urely, therefore, was the co|venant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="15">15. If Chri&s;t did not receive chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, pre|vious to his in&s;tituting and receiving the Lord's &s;up|per, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e the initiating &s;eal of the cove|nant of grace, was already on him in circumci&s;ion; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not receive chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, pre|vious to his in&s;tituting and receiving the Lord's &s;up|per&mdash;which is thus proved:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e the di&s;pen&s;ation to which chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m belongs, was not in being.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e to receive chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, is an in|&s;tance of chri&s;tian obedience; but, it was incon&s;i&s;tent for Je&s;us Chri&s;t to perform any act of chri&s;tian obe|dience for his people, till he had fini&s;hed a righteou&s;|ne&s;s for their ju&s;tification.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Becau&s;e the bapti&s;m, then in u&s;e was <HI>John's</HI> bap|ti&s;m, which was legal not chri&s;tian.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The con&s;equence is, that as Je&s;us Chri&s;t had the witne&s;&s;ing &s;eal of the covenant of grace upon him, in circumci&s;ion, &s;o he was as well qualified for acce&s;s to the Lord's &s;upper, as any can be now by chri&s;tian bapti&s;m. But then 'tis ju&s;t &s;o certain, that the cove|nant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> which contained circumci&s;ion was the covenant of grace.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 1. Why did not Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf baptize, but his di&s;ciples only?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. The bapti&s;m with which his di&s;ciples baptized, was <HI>John's</HI> bapti&s;m; of which before.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. As <HI>John's</HI> bapti&s;m was tipical of chri&s;tian purity; &s;o for Chri&s;t to practice it, would be bearing witne&s;s to him&s;elf; contrary to his own maxim. Jon. v. 31</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. The work of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was to obey the Law; now though the law required him to be baptized, as the induction to his public prie&s;thood; yet no precept or prophet of the law, ever &s;aid he &s;hould baptize with water; &s;o he had no &s;uch work to do.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. What is chri&s;tian bapti&s;m?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="020921_0020_0FB14D54056C90A8">
<HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is being &s;o enriched, and endowed, with the &s;pecial gifts, and graces, of the holy &s;pirit, as is in &s;cripture called, baptized with the holy gho&s;t. Matt. iii. 11. <HI>"He &s;hall baptize you with the holy gho&s;t and with fire."</HI> Where fire is explanatory of this bapti&s;m; for 'tis purifying as fire.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. But as nature abounds with &s;peaking em|blems of &s;piritual things; &s;o it plea&s;ed God to ap|point outward re&s;emblances of inward and &s;piritual things. And the outward &s;ignal, and repre&s;entation of chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, is that external application of water, in the name of the Godhead, which is called bapti&s;m, from its re&s;emblance to true bapti&s;m. Ezek. xxxvi. 25.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. But then the &s;ign mu&s;t always tally with the thing &s;ignified. And therefore as no per&s;on is to|tally &s;ubject to true bapti&s;m; for we are &s;anctified but in part; &s;o to apply the outward &s;ign to the whole body, does not agree to the thing &s;ignified, in any ca&s;e, in this world.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 3. Why was circumci&s;ion appointed a &s;eal of the covenant of grace?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. 'Tis a prerogative of every royalty to chu&s;e and appoint his own &s;eal.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. A &s;eal of the Covenant of grace &s;hould always &s;uit with the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of that cove|nant. When it was e&s;tabli&s;hed with <HI>Noah,</HI> and his &s;eed; the univer&s;al terror, was fear of another flood, and &s;o the rainbow was a &s;ign and &s;eal of the covenant of grace, exactly &s;uited to tho&s;e times. Gen. ix. 9. to 17. But in the gentle reign of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when blood has virtue enough, to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of clean&s;ing our &s;ins; then the clean&s;ing medium of water bapti&s;m, becomes the proper &s;eal of the cove|nant of grace. Whereas for two thou&s;and years be|fore, viz. from Abraham to Chri&s;t, the bu&s;ine&s;s of all that time, was to give a&s;&s;urance that their little bloods would certainly i&s;&s;ue, in the all&s;ufficient blood of the Me&s;&s;iah; for which purpo&s;e nothing could be more
<PB N="22" REF="020921_0021_0FB14D5578CE3898">&s;uitable, than for all families to be con&s;tantly &s;hedding blood in circumci&s;ion; &s;o that was appointed, the wit|ne&s;s and &s;eal of the covenant of grace. Gen. xvii. 10, 11. The bloody ordinance of circumci&s;ion, with all the burden&s;ome rites of that di&s;pen&s;ation, excited de&s;ires, and prayers for Chri&s;t's coming, and gave con|&s;tant a&s;&s;urance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. When was the form of the &s;eal of the covenant changed?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> When the di&s;pen&s;ation was changed, from that of the law, to Chri&s;tianity. When the di&s;pen&s;ation was changed, it was proper its witne&s;&s;ing &s;eal &s;hould in its outward form be altered. Heb. x. 9. <HI>"He took away the fir&s;t that he might e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. When did the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation be|gin?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Exactly when that of the law ended. But neither could the fir&s;t cea&s;e, or the &s;econd begin, till <HI>John's</HI> mini&s;try was fini&s;hed; for he generally &s;poke of Chri&s;t as coming after him. Mark i. 7. Matt. iii. 11. He preached <HI>"the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</HI> So then it was near, but not come.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. The chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation could not be|gin before the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e many legal types could not be fulfilled till that event. Heb. ix. 7, to 16.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t's legal prie&s;thood, which mu&s;t be fini&s;hed, before the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation could begin, was compleated by his offering him&s;elf in death. Heb. viii. 3, 7, 27, ix. 26, x. 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e as the doctrine of Chri&s;t's kingdom was to be peace on earth. Luke ii. 14. And that peace is founded in the blood of the cro&s;s, Col. i. 20. So the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation could not be &s;et up, till that blood was &s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. The chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation could not begin till after Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e his fini&s;hing the attonement mu&s;t be proved, by his re&s;urrection from the dead. But when
<PB N="23" REF="020921_0022_0FB14D570300CC80">God rai&s;ed him, it was proof of his work fully done, and that ju&s;tice was &s;atisfied. Acts ii. 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Pardon of &s;in, the privilege of the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, could not be boldly affirmed; till Chri&s;t's ri&s;|ing had proved the meritorious cau&s;e complete. Heb. ix. 26.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was impo&s;&s;ible to believe, without doubting, in what Chri&s;t had done, till he was proved to be the Son of God with power, by his re&s;urrection from the dead. Rom. i. 4. Therefore his di&s;pen&s;ation could not be|gin till this proof was given.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 4. The chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation could not be|gin till the day of Penteco&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e as Penteco&s;t was the fiftieth day from the &s;econd day of the pa&s;&s;over; &s;o &s;uch as are learn|ed in &s;cripture chronology alledge, <HI>that</HI> was the day, in which the Church was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and her law giv|en from Sinai of old. And the in&s;titution of her chri&s;tian form, mu&s;t an&s;wer ancient types; but then it mu&s;t be on the day of Penteco&s;t, according to Acts ii. 1, which &s;ays <HI>"when the day of Penteco&s;t was fully come."</HI> The in&s;pired words are, <HI>"en too &s;ymplee rou&s;thai,"</HI> as importing, it mu&s;t be at that juncture, neither &s;ooner, nor later.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e it was proper, that the religious privi|leges of this world, &s;hould commence in pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es from every nation under heaven; which was the ca&s;e then, Acts ii. 5. to 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e the circum&s;tances of that day, indicate that the great in&s;titution was upon it. As</P>
<P N="1">1. That God might not &s;urprize his people, with &s;uch important events, without previous notice. He gave them the&s;e days, from Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, to the &s;aid fiftieth day, to dige&s;t the evidence of what they had &s;een, that they might be prepared for this e&s;tab|li&s;hment, ten days after his a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation was to be managed by twelve apo&s;tles, as the old one had been by twelve pa|triarchs; but the&s;e apo&s;tles were not all appointed till
<PB N="24" REF="020921_0023_0FB14D5878F11A48">after Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection. And they were directed to bear witne&s;s of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. after the Holy Gho&s;t was come on them, Acts i. 8; but this was not till Penteco&s;t: Therefore the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation did not begin till that day.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tongues were a needful mean for propagating the go&s;pel; but the&s;e were not given till Penteco&s;t. Therefore this di&s;pen&s;ation did not begin till that day.</P>
<P N="4">4. The go&s;pel is the holy &s;pirit's in&s;trument, in gra|cious operations; but he did not come to po&s;&s;e&s;s and u&s;e it till Penteco&s;t, Acts ii. 2, 3. Therefore his di&s;pen&s;|ation did not begin till that day.</P>
<P N="5">5. Special divine power was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the management of this di&s;pen&s;ation, but the apo&s;tles, the in&s;truments of that work, were commanded <HI>to tarry at Jeru&s;alem, till they &s;hould be endowed with power from on high:</HI> that is, till the promi&s;e of the Father, which was the holy &s;pirit, &s;hould come on them, Luke xxiv. 49. Acts i. 4. But this was not done till Penteco&s;t; there|fore the di&s;pen&s;ation did not begin till that day.</P>
<P N="6">6. The apo&s;tles were not endowed for ca&s;ting out devils, taking up &s;erpents, and being proof again&s;t poi&s;on, &amp;c. which infernal malice again&s;t the go&s;pel would give occa&s;ion for, till Penteco&s;t, Mark xvi. 18, 19, 20.&mdash;Luke xxiv. 49. And &s;o their di&s;pen&s;ation did not begin till that day.</P>
<P N="7">7. Whenever the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation begun, it may be expected &s;uch providences would &s;oon follow, as &s;hould witne&s;s it's divine nature. But &s;uch events took place at Penteco&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Holy Gho&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of go&s;pel truth, as the mean of his gracious operation then.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then did the &s;acred &s;ymbal of it's nature and ef|fects appear in fiery tongues.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then did cloven tongues indicate Gentiles, as well as Jews, to be its de&s;igned objects.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then did their fiery appearance, foretel, the throughly purifying effect of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="5">5. Then were all the world together, to witne&s;s the advent of the univer&s;al religion.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="25" REF="020921_0024_0FB14D59E92858B0">
6. Then was a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed day for miracles and devils malice charging all to drunkenne&s;s. Acts ii. 13.</P>
<P N="7">7. Then was a day the mo&s;t crowned with go&s;pel &s;ucce&s;s, having three thou&s;ands converted at once.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 6. Where is authority for the in&s;titution of outward bapti&s;m?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. In the nature of the ca&s;e. For, as God has been plea&s;ed, in various di&s;pen&s;ations of the co|venant of grace, to appoint an outward &s;ign and &s;eal of it; 'tis therefore certain, that it was right and rea|&s;onable, that the covenant of grace &s;hould have an out|ward &s;ign and &s;eal; but the nature of the ca&s;e deter|mines, it is as right and rea&s;onable now as ever it was; therefore, as there is no pretence, to any other outward initiating &s;ign and &s;eal to the covenant of grace now but outward bapti&s;m; therefore that ought in all rea&s;on, to be held the initiating &s;ign and &s;eal of the covenant of grace now.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. In the in&s;titution of circumci&s;ion. For 'tis certain God appointed circumci&s;ion, Gen. xvii. 10. and called it <HI>"a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith."</HI> Rom. iv. 11. And as there is no pretence of any thing to &s;ucceed circumci&s;ion, as a &s;eal of the covenant of grace but outward bapti&s;m; therefore either circumci&s;ion is &s;till of force, as a &s;eal of the covenant; or el&s;e outward bapti&s;m has taken its place: But we are forbidden to u&s;e the ordinances of that di&s;pen&s;ation, Col. ii. 20, 21, <HI>"Touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not, for they are all to peri&s;h in the u&s;ing."</HI> Therefore outward bapti&s;m is the vi&s;i|ble &s;eal of the covenant of grace.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. In divine in&s;titution, Matt. xxviii. 18, 19, <HI>"All power is given to me in heaven and earth; go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them."</HI> And as this is an expre&s;s command, there is equal authori|ty for bapti&s;m, as for any thing in chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7. Is there any further evidence that bap|ti&s;m comes in place of circumci&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. There is; For &s;ince circumci&s;ion did
<PB N="26" REF="020921_0025_0FB14D5B6960D988">confe&s;&s;edly, terminate with the legal di&s;pen&s;ation, if bapti&s;m does not &s;ucceed to it, then the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, cannot be much more glorious than that of the law; but it is in its outward circum&s;tances much more glorious. II. Cor. iii. 8, 9, 10, 11. There+fore this mu&s;t have an outward initiating &s;eal, as well as that; and as there can be no pretence of any other, it mu&s;t be bapti&s;m. And this exceeds circumci&s;ion, as there is nothing bloody in it, and as it admits females, and la&s;tly, as it expre&s;&s;es what we need, viz. clean&s;ing by the blood of Chri&s;t, more clearly.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. The maxim of chri&s;tianity is, <HI>"give no offence in any thing, to Jew or Gentile."</HI> I. Cor. x. 32. II. Cor. vi. 3. But to &s;top circumci&s;ion, and not replace it by &s;ome other form of a &s;eal to the cove|nant of grace, would have been an inappea&s;ible offence to all Jews; e&s;pecially the mo&s;t &s;erious and godly of them. And it would have been offen&s;ive to Gentiles, to call them under a covenant not &s;o well endowed, as that by which they knew the Jews had ever been dignified. So it is contrary to an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of the bible, to &s;uppo&s;e circumci&s;ion abrogated, and bap|ti&s;m not in&s;tituted in its place.</P>
<P N="3">3. If bapti&s;m does not take the place of circumci|&s;ion, then the church is not &s;o complete in her outward privileges, under Chri&s;t, as &s;he was under Mo&s;es; but divine te&s;timony affirms, the church is <HI>"complete in Chri&s;t."</HI> Col. ii. 10. Therefore bapti&s;m takes the place of circumci&s;ion; and you find, in the 11th ver&s;e, bapti&s;m is called chri&s;tian circumci&s;ion, or the circumci&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and in the 12th ver&s;e this circumci&s;ion is expre&s;sly called bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="4">4. If bapti&s;m imports the &s;ame things, and is of the &s;ame u&s;e now, as circumci&s;ion under, the law then as 'tis certain circumci&s;ion has cea&s;ed, bapti&s;m takes its place.</P>
<P>But, 1. Bapti&s;m imports the &s;ame things; for as none might cat the pa&s;&s;over, till circumci&s;ed, Exod. xii. 49. So the apo&s;tles divinely guided, always bap|tized
<PB N="27" REF="020921_0026_0FB14D5CEC2D7E78">their converts, as their vi&s;ible qualification for church &s;tate, and privileges. As Acts ii. 41. Al&s;o circumci&s;ion was then a &s;eal of the covenant of grace. Rom. iv. 11. And it has been proved that bapti&s;m is &s;o now. And when, I. Pet. iii. 21, &s;ays, <HI>"bapti&s;m doth now &s;ave us."</HI> He implies, 'tis a vi&s;ible witne&s;s of the &s;alvation, which is in the covenant of grace, for its &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bapti&s;m is of the &s;ame u&s;e to us, as circumci&s;ion was to them. For as circumci&s;ion was the ordinance of admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church then; &s;o is bap|ti&s;m now; therefore the apo&s;tles baptized tho&s;e they taught, as &s;et apart for God. And they whom Peter baptized, were added to the Church. Acts ii. 41, 47. Circumci&s;ion was the vi&s;ible badge of relation to God, and his Church; &s;o is bapti&s;m now. Gal. iii. 27. <HI>"As many as are baptized have put on Chri&s;t."</HI> There|fore bapti&s;m an&s;wering the &s;ame purpo&s;es, &s;ucceeds to circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5. Je&s;us Chri&s;t could not be faithful in God's Hou&s;e, the Church, as Mo&s;es was, if when he put an end to circumci&s;ion, he did not in&s;titute bapti&s;m in its place; but he was faithful in the hou&s;e of God, as Mo&s;es was. Heb. iii. 2. Therefore he appointed bapti&s;m, as certainly as Mo&s;es appointed circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 1. The bapti&s;m of the bible, is called a being buried with Chri&s;t, and &s;o means plunging.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Rom. vi. 4, &s;ays, <HI>"buried with him, by bapti&s;m into death."</HI> But there is but one &s;ort of Bap|ti&s;m in the bible, or in the world, that is into death; and that is &s;piritual bapti&s;m, or &s;anctification; which is to the death of &s;in only. Therefore buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m, is not true of any bapti&s;m at all, by water.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. Col. ii. 15. &s;ay, <HI>"buried with him in bapti&s;m."</HI> And it &s;ays al&s;o, <HI>"ri&s;en with him,"</HI> in the &s;ame bapti&s;m. But there is no bapti&s;m in the world, which implies death and re&s;urrection too, but bap|ti&s;m by the holy &s;pirit. And the certain effect of this &s;piritual bapti&s;m is, union to, and not &s;eparation from re|al
<PB N="28" REF="020921_0027_0FB14D5EA43180C0">chri&s;tians. I. Cor. xii. 13. <HI>"For by one &s;pirit, we are all baptized into one body, and have been all made to drink into one &s;pirit."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. But there is no command in the bible for baptizing children.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. It is a reproach common to bapti&s;ts, that they will not allow of fair &s;criptural con&s;equences. But we believe fair &s;criptural con&s;equences, are good &s;crip|tural authority. As</P>
<P N="1">1. If God did once command his people to de|dicate their children to him; and his mind has never changed; then 'tis the mind of God now, that his people &s;hould dedicate their children to him; but if he has abrogated circumci&s;ion, as has been proved; and in&s;tituted bapti&s;m in place of it, as has been prov|ed; then we know 'tis the mind of God now, that his people &s;hould dedicate their children in bapti&s;m. Now he has told us, his mind always was, that cir|cumci&s;ion &s;hould cea&s;e in the u&s;ing. Col. ii. 21.22. And that bapti&s;m &s;hould &s;ucceed to it, as has been proved, &s;o that this alteration, &s;hows no change in the mind of God, about it. And now the fair con&s;e|quence is, that his vi&s;ible people mu&s;t dedicate their children to him in bapti&s;m, or &s;ink into the charac|ter of unbelievers, and di&s;obedient.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tis a command of God, <HI>"If thou know not, go thy way forth by the foot&s;teps of the flock."</HI> Cant. i. 8. But we know that the flock of God, for two thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t always dedicated their children to God, with acceptance, it being according to his ex|pre&s;s command. And there is rea&s;on to judge, that when Chri&s;t commanded his followers to baptize all nations, he meant they &s;hould baptize children; both becau&s;e they are a great part of all nations; and be|cau&s;e they had been always u&s;ed to dedicate children of profe&s;&s;ing parents; and he makes no exception a|bout it. And when <HI>Peter</HI> directed the multitude of his hearers, <HI>to be baptized, every one of them.</HI> Acts ii. 38, 39. And in&s;tead of &s;aying, <HI>but not your children,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="020921_0028_0FB14D5FE941DBF0">he adds, as a rea&s;on taken from divine command|ment, <HI>"For the promi&s;e,"</HI> meaning Abraham's cove|nant, <HI>"is to you and your children."</HI> And he implies, that the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hment extended to the Gentiles, as tho&s;e afar off, as fa&s;t as they &s;hould receive the &s;ame faith. And the fair con&s;equence of all this is, that be|lievers ought to give up their children in bapti&s;m. Nor will it help the cau&s;e of &s;uch as di&s;like this con|clu&s;ion, to wi&s;h there was a little alteration of the bi|ble on this head,</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, as we have rea&s;on to judge the apo&s;tles practiced infant bapti&s;m, becau&s;e they tell us they baptized whole hou&s;holds, of which children are gene|rally a part. And they had always u&s;ed a like prac|tice; and never gave a word of caution again&s;t ad|mitting the children of chri&s;tians, with their parents, as they certainly would, if 'twas wrong. So we hi&s;to|rically know, that many nations have practiced it, and do &s;till, viz. all who are called chri&s;tians, in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and divers nations in Europe. So that 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee what it is to follow the foot-&s;teps of the flock, in this ca&s;e; and what they mu&s;t expect, who di&s;regard this commandment, with its evidence.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. Bapti&s;ts &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e that the bible favours their peculiar notions of bapti&s;m, which don't lie in baptizing profe&s;&s;ing adults who were not bap|tized in infancy for that is our con&s;tant practice. But what is peculiar to bapti&s;ts, is, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to deny bapti&s;m to young children, even of profe&s;&s;ing parents; for which there is not one word in the bible. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> to baptize adults, who have already been baptized in in|fancy; and the bible knows as little of this as the o|ther. Now till the&s;e their two peculiar points become &s;criptural, which 'tis certain they never will, bapti&s;ts &s;hould be very &s;paring in boa&s;ting of favour from the bible.</P>
<P N="3">3. I am now according to the methods propo&s;ed to &s;hew what were the contents of the covenant of grace as e&s;tabli&s;hed with Abraham. And I &s;hall take
<PB N="30" REF="020921_0029_0FB14D6169BF64A8">notice only of two things contained in that covenant, and con&s;ider them together.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The infant children of believing parents, are there declared to be in the covenant of grace, with their parents. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The &s;eal of that covenant is there ordered by God to be applied to them. But it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et &s;ome things, relative to the&s;e points, in their true light, before I proceed to the points them&s;elves, as Bapti&s;ts do not &s;eem to notice them rightly.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 1. How can any, either parents or children, be in the covenant of grace, without &s;aving faith?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. 'Tis certain &s;ome infants have been &s;anc|tified from the womb. As Jer. i. 5. Al&s;o <HI>John</HI> the bapti&s;t. Luke i. 15. And what has been of that kind, certainly may be again, and there is rea&s;on to think, &s;ome are &s;o &s;till. I know the word <HI>&s;anctified,</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed only for &s;eque&s;tration to divine u&s;e. But other expre&s;&s;ions, in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> as well as the concurrent &s;en&s;e of interpreters, make it evident enough, that <HI>Jeremiah</HI> had gracious &s;anctifi|cation; and of cour&s;e, infants are certainly capable of &s;aving faith. And whoever knows, that the gift of faith, is totally a work of God; and that the difference of adult years, from infancy, in re&s;pect to the be&s;tow|ment of &s;aving faith, is that it encrea&s;es oppo&s;ition, and never furni&s;hes any concurrence; will doubtle&s;s allow that a &s;tate of infancy, in it&s;elf, is of no weight at all, again&s;t &s;aving faith being wrought.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. Being in the covenant of grace, does not always imply &s;aving faith, or any other &s;aving grace. The covenant of grace has its outward court, ju&s;t as the holy temple had, I. Kings, viii. 64, and many texts. And ju&s;t as the godhead in Chri&s;t had the outward court of fle&s;h and blood, in his manhood; in which, tho' it was holy, was no divinity at all. So 'tis common for rich palaces, to have court-yards round them, con|taining things belonging to the palace, but not fit to be be&s;towed in its interior apartments. So has the
<PB N="31" REF="020921_0030_0FB14D62E7653480">covenant of grace its outward court, and to this be|longs the un&s;anctified children, hou&s;es, cattle, fields, &amp;c. of all the believers. Now I will prove that the covenant of grace, has &s;uch outward court.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every under&s;tanding chri&s;tian in the world, holds his hou&s;e, cattle, all he has, are in the covenant of grace; how el&s;e &s;hould he take hold of the truth and faithfulne&s;s of God, in prayer about them; but the&s;e can only be in &s;uch outward court of that cove|nant.</P>
<P N="2">2. This doctrine of an outward court to the cove|nant of grace, gives light about many &s;criptures. As John xv. 2. <HI>"Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, will be finally burned."</HI> But there are no &s;uch branches in Chri&s;t, but the&s;e who are in this outward court of the covenant of grace, who are in Chri&s;t only by out|ward appearance, vi&s;ible &s;tanding, or mere profe&s;&s;ion. So al&s;o Matt. xv. 3. <HI>"the&s;e are the plants which God hath not planted,"</HI> viz. in the inward &s;pirit and grace of his covenant, and &s;o <HI>"they mu&s;t be rooted up."</HI> There|fore many may be in the covenant, without &s;aving grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. You know God often calls the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> his people, as Exod. iii. 7, 10, and vii. 4, which ne|ce&s;&s;arily implies, they were in the covenant of grace; and yet you know they were not in the &s;pecial grace of that covenant generally. For they were a rebelli|ous people, and God often threatens to ca&s;t them off utterly. So it appears, they were only in this porch, or outward court of the covenant. But then the con|&s;equence is, that per&s;ons may be in the covenant of grace, without any &s;aving grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis in this &s;en&s;e God claims and owns the chil|dren of his covenant people, when they were general|ly fallen to idolatry; but not yet vi&s;ibly ca&s;t off. As Ezek. xvi. 20.21, and xxiii. 37. <HI>"Ye have taken your &s;ons and daughters, which ye did bear unto me, and have &s;lain my children, by cau&s;ing them to pa&s;s through the fire."</HI> viz. to Moloch. And the margin of the text refers to Gen. xvii. 7.11. where the covenant of grace was
<PB N="32" REF="020921_0031_0FB14D6484076AF8">e&s;tabli&s;hed with Abraham and his infant &s;eed; to &s;hew the wickedne&s;s of this conduct. But the&s;e children, and indeed their parents too, were in God's covenant claim, only as they were in this outward court of the covenant of grace. Therefore parents and children may be in the covenant of grace without any &s;aving grace; which was to be proved.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 2. What are the privileges of young chil|dren in the covenant of grace?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. God knows they are his creatures, and that he has required his people to dedicate them to him in his appointed way, and <HI>"he is ever mindful of his covenant."</HI> P&s;al. iii. 5. And the p&s;almi&s;t draws the con&s;equence. P&s;al. cxv. 12, 13. <HI>"The Lord has been mindful of us, and will ble&s;s us. He will ble&s;s them that fear him, the &s;mall with the great."</HI> So the Hebrew is. And if God's ble&s;&s;ing &s;mall children, as well as parents, is allowed to be a privilege, then the que&s;tion will be allowed to be an&s;wered, by all who duly regard the word of God.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. The p&s;almi&s;t held the privilege of a child in the covenant of grace, very great, when he &s;aid, P&s;al. lxxxvi. 16. <HI>"Oh turn to me, and have mercy on me, and &s;ave the &s;on of thine hand-maid!"</HI> Importing, <HI>"my mother was in covenant with thee, &s;he gave me to thee, in thine own way."</HI> Now I pray grant me the privileges of that covenant, in which I was given up to thee at eight days old. Again he &s;ays. P&s;al. cxvi. 16. <HI>"Oh Lord I am thy &s;ervant, I am thy &s;ervant, the &s;on of thine handmaiden!"</HI> Importing, I am doubly bound to fi|delity in thy &s;ervice; viz. by my own covenant obli|gations, and by the early dedication of my pious parent. Tho&s;e then who love the obligations of the covenant of grace, will hold it a privilege to be under them. <HI>Bath&s;heba</HI> al&s;o, as became a pious penitent, urges on King <HI>Lemuel,</HI> his duty, from the con&s;idera|tion of the vows, by which &s;he had dedicated him to God, in his own way. And &s;uch as hold urgent ar|guments to holine&s;s, a privilege, will allow their chil|dren
<PB N="33" REF="020921_0032_0FB14D65E73E6EB8">privilege by that holy covenant in which they have been vowed to God. <HI>Samuel's</HI> piety and honors were his privilege, in con&s;equence of an early and pious de|dication to God, in the covenant of grace. I. Sam. i. 11.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. Godly parents have advantage to plead the covenant of grace for their children, given up in a covenant way. And if 'tis allowed to be a great privilege for children to have &s;uch prayers made for them, which is peculiar to &s;uch as have given up their children to God, in his own covenant way; then this is another an&s;wer to the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 4. Children given to God in his own cove|nant way, may always plead their outward covenant relation to God, for deliverance in any di&s;tre&s;s: As David did, P&s;al. cxix. 94. <HI>"I am thine, &s;ave me."</HI> Such as are not addicted to plead promi&s;es, will hold this an&s;wer very light. All others will allow the weight of it.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> But God hears no prayers but &s;uch as proceed from &s;aving faith.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This objection proceeds from an antinomian principle; and indicates ignorance of the &s;criptures, and of the power of God. Prayer is fir&s;t of all the language of nature in di&s;tre&s;s; and the God of na|ture hears it. For 'tis an aphori&s;m of the kind bible. I&s;a. xxv. 4. <HI>"He is a &s;trength to the needy in his di&s;tre&s;s."</HI> And he hears the cry of the ravens. P&s;al. cxlvii. 9. The God of nature, hears the voice of nature in man and bea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 5. The Church of God holds it&s;elf bound, to exerci&s;e watchfulne&s;s, and careful in&s;pection, over the lives and manners, of &s;uch as having been dedi|cated to God, are become the children of the church. As P&s;al. xxxiv. 11. <HI>"Come ye children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord."</HI> For 'tis a max|im with the church of God, <HI>"the things that are reveal|ed belong to us, and to our children forever."</HI> Deut. xxix. 29. Therefore 'tis &s;aid of Chri&s;t, the great
<PB N="34" REF="020921_0033_0FB14D676A85E510">head and patron of his Church, I&s;a. xl. 11. <HI>"He &s;hall feed his flock like a &s;hepherd, He &s;hall gather the lambs, with his arm, and carry them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> bo&s;om."</HI> And there|fore Chri&s;t forbids his people to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> little children from coming to him, and intimated, they were under the watch and government of his church, by &s;aying, "<HI>for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Matt. xix. 14. Accordingly when Chri&s;t gave order to <HI>Peter</HI> how to treat his &s;heep, he e&s;pecially charges him <HI>to feed his lambs.</HI> John xxi. 15. The in&s;pired words are. <HI>"bo&s;|ke ta arnia mou."</HI> Which allude to the ca&s;e of chil|dren in a natural family, where over&s;ight and govern|ment, belong to feeding. And all &s;uch as chu&s;e to have their children in&s;pected and well regulated, will certainly hold this a great privilege. And to this all children publicly dedicated, are of right always &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 6. The con&s;ideration of &s;uch &s;olemn dedica|tion to God, has a tendency to &s;olemnize and re&s;train the &s;pirit and manners of &s;uch children. And &s;urely all advantage this way is a privilege. And for this rea&s;on, children &s;hould be taught the nature of &s;uch dedication.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 7. The obligation ari&s;ing to chri&s;tian parents, from &s;uch &s;olemn dedication is Eph. vi. 4, <HI>"bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."</HI> And eve|ry faithful parent e&s;teems his obligation this way a pri|vilege, which centers in covenanted children.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> 3. What is it that is &s;ealed by a &s;ealing or|dinance?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Never the immediate object. Per&s;ons or children are no more &s;ealed in bapti&s;m, than the cloud was, in which was the rainbow, which was a &s;eal of the covenant of grace in <HI>Noah's</HI> time. Gen. ix. 13, 14, 15. The immediate &s;ubject of bapti&s;m, is not at all morally or &s;piritually affected by that ordinance. The &s;pirit of God may be&s;tow quickning, comfort, ble&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, to a believing parent, or a believing adult at the time of the admin&s;tration; as
<PB N="35" REF="020921_0034_0FB14D68E825A620">he &s;ometimes does in a clap of thunder: An earth|quake; or a &s;udden death. When the apo&s;tle &s;ays <HI>"Bapti&s;m doth now &s;ave us."</HI> I. Pet. iii. 20, 21. He tells us it is as <HI>Noah's</HI> ark &s;aved him. The ark was a &s;en&s;ible mean of &s;ecurity from the flood: And e&s;|pecially &s;peaking &s;ignal of future &s;alvation by Chri&s;t. So bapti&s;m is a &s;ure evidence of pardon and &s;alvation to be had; but bapti&s;m it&s;elf gives none of it. And &s;o the apo&s;tle explains him&s;elf, when he &s;ays, <HI>"not the putting away of the Filth of the fle&s;h; but the an&s;wer,"</HI> or corre&s;pondence, <HI>"of a good con&s;cience:"</HI> in the covenant|ing agent. And this derives not all from the ordi|nance it&s;elf; but from the holy &s;pirit of grace.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. The only thing actually &s;ealed in bap|ti&s;m is the covenant of grace. Bapti&s;m is like every thing el&s;e in chri&s;tianity, <HI>"a witne&s;s to the truth."</HI> John xviii. 37. And &s;o &s;erves the &s;ame purpo&s;e as circumci&s;ion did; which God him&s;elf has told us was a &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith. Rom. iv. 11. It gives a certain pre&s;ent witne&s;s of the truth of chri&s;tian|ity. And &s;o reminds every believer, of the certainty of the ground of his hope; and of the matter of his faith. And &s;o by the frequency and believing u&s;e of it, chri&s;tians <HI>may hold fa&s;t their confidence, and the rejoicing of their hope firm unto the end.</HI> Heb. iii. 6. Bapti&s;m is al&s;o a declarative &s;eal, witne&s;s, and monitor, to the beholding world, as far as they are in&s;tructed enough to under|&s;tand its &s;peaking import; it be&s;peaks a certainly, in all the materials of the go&s;pel, and true religion. And &s;o the go&s;pel kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as antitype to that of David, <HI>"is e&s;tabli&s;hed forever as the Moon, and as a faithful witne&s;s in Heaven, Selah."</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 37. And &s;o by this ordinance, as a picture of his blood he witne&s;&s;eth al&s;o on the earth. According to, I. John, v. 8.</P>
<P>Now let us return to what was propo&s;ed; viz. To &s;hew that the contents of the covenant, with Abraham were, that infant children of believers, were declared to be in the covenant of grace, with their parents; and
<PB N="36" REF="020921_0035_0FB14D6A67B53CC8">accordingly the &s;eal of the covenant was ordered by God him&s;elf to be outwardly applied to them. And the fir&s;t evidence I &s;hall give of this affair is the letter of the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the bible &s;ays, that God declared the children of believers to be in the covenant of grace, with their parents; and that God accordingly ordered the &s;eal of that covenant to be applied to them; then &s;uch children are in that covenant, and the &s;eal of it mu&s;t be outwardly applied to them: But the bible does &s;ay &s;o; therefore &s;uch children are in that covenant, and mu&s;t have its &s;eal applied to them. For Gen. xvii. 7. &amp;c. &s;ays, <HI>"I will e&s;tabli&s;h my covenant between me and thee, and thy &s;eed after thee, in their generations, for an ever|la&s;ting covenant, to be a God to thee, and thy &s;eed after thee. And God &s;aid unto Abraham thou &s;hall keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy &s;eed after thee, in their generations. This is my covenant which ye &s;hall keep, between me and you, and thy &s;eed after thee, every man child among you &s;hall be circumci&s;ed. And ye &s;hall circumci&s;e the fle&s;h of your fore&s;kin, and it &s;hall be a token of the covenant between me and you. And he that is eight days old, &s;hall be circumci&s;ed among you, every man child in your generations; he that is born in the hou&s;e, or bought with money of any &s;tranger, which is not of thy &s;eed, he that is born in the hou&s;e, and he that is bought with thy money, mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed, and my covenant, &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an everla&s;ting covenant; and the un|circumci&s;ed manchild, who&s;e fle&s;h of his fore&s;kin is not circumci&s;ed, that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my cov|enant."</HI></P>
<P>Now, Rom. xv. 4. &s;ays <HI>"whatever things were wri|ten aforetime;"</HI> viz. as long ago as <HI>Abraham, were writ|ten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the &s;criptures might have hope."</HI> And to prove that this text refers to this e&s;tabli&s;hment with <HI>Abraham;</HI> the 8th ver&s;e adds, <HI>"Now this I &s;ay, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a mini&s;ter of the circumci&s;ion, for the truth of God."</HI> But then the covenant of circumci&s;ion, was the truth of God; to be continued down to us Gentiles. And
<PB N="37" REF="020921_0036_0FB14D6C194ADE68">to prove it, the apo&s;tle adds, <HI>"to confirm the promi&s;es, made to the fathers."</HI> Pointing to this covenant with <HI>Abraham.</HI> And then gives the rea&s;on; <HI>"that the Gen|tiles might rejoice with his people,"</HI> viz. in the enjoyment of the e&s;tabli&s;hment with <HI>Abraham.</HI> Now all who be|lieve the bible mu&s;t confe&s;s, that children were taken into the covenant of grace, with their parents, and that the &s;eal of it was applied to them. And in the &s;aid 15th chap. of Romans, the apo&s;tle proves, that the&s;e things were not ordered for Jews only; but e&s;pecially for Gentiles; for the time of the New-Te&s;tament; i. e. for us. But the holy &s;pirit who guided the apo&s;|tle, knew that circumci&s;ion, in its jewi&s;h form, was never to take place with us: but that bapti&s;m, which is the chri&s;tian circumci&s;ion, was to be in u&s;e now, as has been proved. The con&s;equence is, that the chil|dren of believing parents, are in the covenant of grace, with &s;uch parents, and by them to be given up to God in bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the plaine&s;t &s;en&s;e of Act. ii. 39. <HI>"be baptized for the promi&s;e is to you and your children,"</HI> is, that chil|dren are under the outward admini&s;tration of the cove|nant of grace, if their parents are in the &s;pirit and grace of that covenant; and that therefore the &s;eal of it, is to be outwardly applied to them; then this is good authority for our practice; for &s;cripture ought always to be under&s;tood in the plaine&s;t &s;en&s;e that is con&s;i&s;tent with the whole. But that this is the plaine&s;t con&s;i&s;t|ent &s;en&s;e of the text; I &s;hall now prove.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis exactly agreeable to the letter of the text, as all may &s;ee, if they read impartially.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis exactly agreeable to the practice of all God's people, for two thou&s;and years before that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. As <HI>Peter</HI> knew the Jews were tenacious of their re|ligious rites; &s;o you may &s;ee, if you plea&s;e, that <HI>Peter</HI> who perfectly knew what his hearers were u&s;ed to; would not give them offence at the new chri&s;tian reli|gion; by cutting off their children from their u&s;ual privilege; but lets them know in this fir&s;t chri&s;tian &s;ermon, that this new religion extended privilege to
<PB N="38" REF="020921_0037_0FB14D6D68FF0A78">them and to their children ju&s;t as the bible always did.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Peter</HI> knew the will of God, was <HI>"give no offence to Jew or Gentile, or the church of God."</HI> He knew al&s;o that the moment he gave the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that this new religion, was &s;o much narrower, and le&s;s glorious in outward privileges, than what they had always been &s;ubject to, as to exclude all their children, from cove|nant privilege; they would immediately renounce it, and conceive offence not to be removed. And as he knew there was no ground for this offence; but that they were all under the &s;ame covenant, to which they were always &s;ubject; He therefore addre&s;&s;es them in language they had always heard; importing <HI>"you and your children &s;tand related to God, and his covenant, ju&s;t as you, and they always did; God is not altered, the cove|nant is the &s;ame, the promi&s;e is to you and to your children, ju&s;t as it always was.</HI> And 'tis evident they under|&s;tood him &s;o; and &s;o all proceeded, without one word of objection.</P>
<P N="5">5. To con&s;true this text as bapti&s;ts do, is to &s;et a|&s;ide the plain literal &s;en&s;e of the text, although it per|fectly con&s;i&s;ts with the whole bible; it al&s;o implies that the mind of God is altered &s;ince <HI>Abraham's</HI> time, which is athei&s;tical. It implies al&s;o that the covenant with <HI>Abraham</HI> was not the covenant of grace, contrary to the above demon&s;trations. If then we would avoid &s;uch &s;entiments, let us allow the text to &s;peak hone&s;t|ly its own meaning; and then we &s;hall adopt the mind of God, plainly expre&s;t in it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Peter</HI> had now a fine advantage to have taught his hearers otherwi&s;e; viz. to have told them, <HI>"you are now under another di&s;pen&s;ation, and mu&s;t not expect any old Jewi&s;h matter to be continued to you" &amp;c.</HI> It was a fine opportunity to advance the bapti&s;ts notion of this text; for his hearers were &s;oft and ductile, fit to receive any thing from their &s;piritual father; it was al&s;o a time for new things to take place. Be&s;ide, he was di|vinely bound to &s;peak the thing, as it was. And doubt|le&s;s, but two rea&s;ons can be devi&s;ed, why he delivered
<PB N="39" REF="020921_0038_0FB14D6EE7BFC418">him&s;elf as he did, viz. becau&s;e it was true, and becau&s;e the rever&s;e was not true. But indeed the apo&s;tle was not &s;o far advanced in the light of modern times, as to &s;ee rea&s;on to correct a gro&s;s error in divine conduct, in put|ting &s;uch &s;ubjects into his holy covenant, as were no way fit for that &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mark x. 13. 14, &s;ays, They brought young chil|dren to Chri&s;t; be &s;ure not to be baptized; for he baptized not. John iv. 2. Rea&s;ons for which have been given above. But Matt. xix. 13. &s;ays, <HI>"that he &s;hould put his hands on them and pray."</HI> Mark x. 13, &s;ays, <HI>"that he &s;hould touch them"</HI> and the 16th ver&s;e &s;hews they meant that he &s;hould ble&s;s them; which he did. But this ble&s;&s;ing mu&s;t come from the trea|&s;ury of the covenant of grace. But we are &s;ure, a ble&s;|&s;ing from the covenant of grace, could not be be&s;towed on &s;uch as were not in that covenant. For a divine rule is, <HI>"give not that which is holy to dogs."</HI> Matt. vii. 6. But then tis evident the&s;e children of his covenant peo|ple, were in the covenant of grace. And though he did not baptize them, he required them to be brought to him, to receive a covenant ble&s;&s;ing. And if there is no way for his people to copy out this in&s;truction vi&s;ibly now, but by bapti&s;mal dedication, according to the revealed mind of him who changeth not; then 'tis their duty, &s;o to dedicate them. And though there were &s;ome even then, who oppo&s;ed this practice of bringing children to Chri&s;t for a covenant ble&s;&s;ing; yet it was done; and received great encouragement by Chr&s;t's being much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who op|po&s;ed it; and al&s;o by his command, equally binding now as then. <HI>"Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not."</HI> And his rea&s;on for it is of force now, <HI>"for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven."</HI> And 'tis of no importance in the ca&s;e, whether by <HI>"kingdom of heaven."</HI> is de&s;igned the church militant or triumphant; &s;ince they are both of one nature. And if children belong to either, they are entitled at lea&s;t, to the privileges of the former. And if Je&s;us Chri&s;t now owns little children to belong to the kingdom of heaven; if you
<PB N="40" REF="020921_0039_0FB14D70673B22F8">are not &s;ure of their &s;alvation, you are the more &s;ure they belong to the vi&s;ible church. Therefore who is he that &s;hall dare deny them?</P>
<P N="4">4. If the principle of forbidding a dedication of children in bapti&s;m, tends to prevent the millennium, or glorious &s;tate of the church in this world, in which the prophecies of &s;cripture &s;o generally centre; then 'tis an un&s;criptural principle; but it has &s;uch a palpable tendency. For in the millennium all nations are to flow into the church of God; I&s;a. ii. 2. But chil|dren are a great part of all nations; and the hope of the people, both for church and &s;tate. And to exclude them all from &s;o much as the outward court of the church of God, is to &s;hut them all up vi&s;ibly in the devil's kingdom: for all who are not of the vi&s;ible church, are, as to their vi&s;ible &s;tanding, in the king|dom of the devil. And to place all children there has a direct tendency to prevent all nations ever to be|come, entirely the kingdom of Chri&s;t. Whereas if they were dedicated to him, according to his own plan; and &s;o put in his way; he would be holden by his co|venant to take care of them; <HI>for he is ever mindful of his covenant.</HI> P&s;al. iii. 5. They would be in the way of religious in&s;pection and regulation, in&s;truction, pray|ers, every mean, private and public, appointed to rip|en them for divine &s;ervice. But to exclude them from all tho&s;e, has an awful tendency to keep them out of God's appointed way, and to prevent the de|&s;igns of his grace in this world. And &s;o is an un&s;crip|tural and anti&s;criptural principle. I am &s;en&s;ible anti|nomians who are hearty enemies to the laws and regu|lations of God's hou&s;e, will ea&s;ily harden them&s;elves again&s;t this rea&s;oning; for at bottom, they hate a re|ligion which confronts their loo&s;e and licentious &s;pirit. But the people of God may comfort them&s;elves, &s;uch unhappy people are more again&s;t God and the bible than again&s;t any of his people. And we may be &s;ure, divine truth will have weight, with all who&s;e hearts are found in God's &s;tatutes.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. This is no more a bar to their dedication in bap|ti&s;m, than it was in ca&s;e of circumci&s;ion, little children are as able to believe now, as they were when God declared them to be in the covenant of grace of old. 'Tis no mark of one being taught of God, to be di&s;po&s;ed to dictate his maker; or di&s;pute his revealed will.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. When little children are denied bapti&s;m, on this principle, that they can't believe. It looks like an evidence of unregeneracy; for it &s;eems to imply that an adult, can contribute &s;omething toward getting true faith; but an infant cannot, for want of abilities, which &s;hews ignorance of the nature of human depravity, and of the power of God For faith is &s;olely the gift of God Eph. ii. 8. And infants cer|tainly have not &s;o &s;trong oppo&s;ition to this work; and adults as certainly never concur in it. Rom viii. 7</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 4. God knew the &s;tate of infants with re&s;pect to believing when he connected circumci&s;ion with faith; for Abraham believed before circumci&s;ion was commanded. Gen. xv. 6. And all parents of his progeny believed the great doctrines of revealed religion, in tho&s;e days. And &s;o dedicated their children in circumci&s;ion. And this fully explains the doctrine of <HI>"believe and be baptized."</HI> The command lies on the agent, not the infant &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 5. We in&s;i&s;t on the principle <HI>"believe and be baptized,"</HI> as &s;trictly as any; but we in&s;i&s;t on it only where God orig|inally required it; viz. in the agent, who is bound by the command, and who can obey, and accordingly de&s;ires bap|ti&s;m, for his child, if he is a parent; as a part of him&s;elf, and as what God requires of him, as his own, and to be rendered to him in his own way. We therefore keep his command|ment exactly according to the original &s;tate of it. Whereas bapti&s;ts in&s;i&s;t on it, where it never was required, in the ori|ginal e&s;tabli&s;hment of the covenant to which all the&s;e things belong. For God &s;aid not a word of faith in the infant &s;ub|ject of circumci&s;ion; but in the agent, the parent, or actor in the affair; who feels the bond of duty, and who being him|&s;elf dedicated to God, means to dedicate the&s;e branches of him&s;elf al&s;o, viz. his children.</P>
<P><HI>Obj</HI> 2. But little children know nothing of what whey are doing; have no &s;en&s;e of the affair.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="020921_0041_0FB14D7378BF5BE8">
<HI>An&s;.</HI> They do nothing in the affair, and have nothing to do. They are not the &s;ubjects of command about it; nor have any duty to do in it. But they have full as much &s;en&s;e about the matter now, as tho&s;e had who were circumci&s;ed in infancy, when this covenant and its &s;eal were e&s;tabli&s;hed of old. And the author of the whole &s;cheme, knew full as much about it at fir&s;t, as any body does now. He knew how this te&s;t of allegiance would operate through all generations. But as he did order it; &s;o we mean to obey his revealed will without di&s;puting it with him; without charging him with error, or ab&s;urdity in it; or &s;ub&s;tituting our own imagination about it. For we know <HI>"the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."</HI> Deut. xxix. 29.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the letter of the apo&s;tolick commi&s;&s;ion, doth not ex|clude children, as it certainly would if it was the mind of God to exclude them; but includes them with their parents; then we ought to include them, and allow them to be the &s;ubjects of that witne&s;&s;ing ordinance, which God has appoint|ed for them; but that commi&s;&s;ion does naturally include them; therefore we mu&s;t include them, and apply the ordinance of bapti&s;m to them, as God has directed. The words of that commi&s;&s;ion are <HI>"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, bapti|zing them."</HI> Now if 'tis certain and well known that children are always a great part of all nations; then they are not ex|cluded, when the command &s;ays <HI>all nations,</HI> but nece&s;&s;arily included; &s;ince there is no exception at all made. Be&s;ide if the command had been <HI>"circumci&s;e all nations,"</HI> the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of children, could not have been doubted; and be &s;ure 'tis as evident they are to be admitted now. For the in|&s;titutor, and his authority are the &s;ame; the covenant is the &s;ame; and bapti&s;m is exactly in place of circumci&s;ion, as has been proved. Therefore the children of vi&s;ible chri&s;tans, are in the covenant of grace with their parents; and by divine direction the &s;eal of that covenant is to be applied to them.</P>
<P N="7">7. The la&s;t evidence I &s;hall adduce for the point, is the evident import of Rom. xi. 17. <HI>"If &s;ome of the Jews, were broken off from the former &s;tate of the church and gentiles were grafted in their place, and &s;o gentiles under the go&s;pel, partake with &s;uch jews as believed, and &s;o were not broken off, in the root and fatne&s;s of that former &s;tate of the church,</HI> &amp;c. Then the following things are certainly true, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That by olive tree, in the clo&s;e of this text, is meant the church of God, in which tho&s;e Jews who believed, and &s;o were not &s;till broken off, &s;till remained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That when gentiles were converted under the go&s;pel, they were grafted into the &s;ame church &s;tate, with tho&s;e Jews who &s;tood by faith, and were never broken off.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And &s;o the believing gentiles, did with tho&s;e Jews, who
<PB N="43" REF="020921_0042_0FB14D7504858050">were never broken off, equally partake of the root, i. e. of the church privileges derived from <HI>Abraham,</HI> or the in&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed with him; and of the fatne&s;s, i. e. the promi&s;es, ordinances, and ble&s;&s;ings, of that good olive tree, the church of God. All which may be reduced to the two following heads.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That all gentile chri&s;tians, are grafted in, and belong to that church which was fir&s;t founded on the covenant made with Abraham, and which was commanded to u&s;e circumci|&s;ion, as the vi&s;ible &s;eal of the covenant. And &s;o all gentile chri&s;tians came to be entitled to all the ordinances and privi|leges of the church, down from <HI>Abraham.</HI> But circumci&s;ion of children was one of them. Therefore, &s;ince God has only altered the form of this ordinance, which al&s;o the apo&s;tle knew, when he wrote this text; gentile chri&s;tians, being now in the &s;ame church, are equally bound to dedicate children in bap|ti&s;m, as Gods people of old were in circumci&s;ion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As this in&s;ertion of all gentile believers, into the &s;ame church, is called grafting; &s;o it implies that their children are &s;et in with them; ju&s;t as the buds of a cyon are &s;et into the &s;tock, with the cyon, as parts of it&s;elf. And as the cyon, with its buds all partake of the &s;ap of their &s;tock; &s;o chri&s;tians with their children partake in the &s;ame privilege of religious dedication by bapti&s;m, as the people of God, did of old by circumci&s;ion. 'Tis certain, God never had, or de&s;igned to have, more than one church. There never was more than one &s;uch good olive tree. The lamb never had, or will have more than one wife, Rev. xxi. 9. The covenant of grace, is her only charter of priviledges; and bapti&s;m is her only initi|ating &s;eal; the fir&s;t public witne&s;s of the truth, durablene&s;s, and certainty, of her grand charter. And as circumci&s;ion of their children was part of the fatne&s;s of that &s;tate of the good olive tree; we being grafted into the &s;ame olive tree, have this branch of her fatne&s;s, in chri&s;tian bapti&s;m. And &s;uch as daily attend to, and regard this word of God, may be fully &s;atisfied in the conclu&s;ion.</ITEM>

<P N="4">4. And this brings me in the la&s;t place, to &s;hew what pro|vi&s;ion God has made for the propagation of the&s;e contents.</P>
<P N="1">1. Bapti&s;mal dedication is one mean to propagate and di&s;|tingui&s;h the vi&s;ible church, and &s;o to attain the end and de&s;ign of the covenant of grace in this world. As circumci&s;ion was an ingredient in the wall of &s;eparation, between the church of God, of old, and the heathen world, &s;o is bapti&s;m now; for all who are not baptized, are heathen in their vi&s;ible &s;tanding. When the apo&s;tle Peter had declared. Act. ii. 39. That bap|ti&s;m belonged to believers and their children; ju&s;t as circum|ci&s;ion did, from <HI>Abraham</HI> down to that very day, in which he delivered this doctrine; he afterwards compares bapti&s;m to <HI>Noah's</HI> ark, &s;o that as the ark was a mean and pledge of &s;afety to <HI>Noah</HI> and his family; ju&s;t &s;o he &s;ays, <HI>bapti&s;m doth now &s;ave
<PB N="44" REF="020921_0043_0FB14D7677075B48">us.</HI> I. Pet. iii. 21. But intimates at the &s;ame time, 'tis not the mere formal action, that does it, any more that <HI>Noah</HI> and his family were &s;aved from the flood, merely by the ark, which if God had not upheld and kept, mu&s;t have foundered by the weather and the flood. But bapti&s;mal dedication, is like the ark, a mean and pledge of &s;afety and pre&s;ervation to the church of God. 'Tis of God's own appointing; and by it, his vi&s;ible church is di&s;tingui&s;hed, from all who do not prac|tically own the true God. And as he owns and honors his own appointments; &s;o this ordinance, as the witne&s;&s;ing &s;eal of his covenant, and mark of his people, is evidence of his promi&s;&s;ed-fidelity, in watching over them, and pre&s;erving them, as his people and church, from final ruin in this world. Even the gates of hell, can't prevail to that effect. Mat. vi. 18. Nay the church which is faithful in the&s;e ob&s;ervances <HI>"&s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed forever as the moon, and as a faithful witne&s;s in heaven, Selah</HI> P&s;al. lxxxix. 37.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another mean of divine appointment, for perpetuating the de&s;igns of the covenant of grace, in this world, is family in&s;truction, and government. Therefore Deut. vi. 7. After referring to the e&s;tabli&s;hment with Abraham in &s;everal points, &s;ays, <HI>"Thou &s;halt teach them diligently to thy children."</HI> And to fix a &s;olemn engagement on them, to do &s;o, adds 15th ver&s;e. <HI>Le&s;t the anger of the Lord thy God, be kindled again&s;t thee, and be de&s;troy thee from off the face of the earth".</HI> Which implies that if they were faithful in this duty of family in&s;truction, it &s;hould be a mean of their pre&s;ervation, as a church, and people of God, on the face of the earth. To which the apo&s;|tle, long &s;ince, refers Eph vi. 4. "<HI>Bring them,</HI> your children <HI>up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI> Nay the wi&s;dom of God has determined both means and end. Prov. xxii. 6. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it</HI> And God has added the chri&s;t|ian confirmation. II. Tim iii. 15. <HI>"From a child thou ha&s;t known the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make thee wi&s;e unto &s;alvation"</HI> And the holy &s;pirit in giving laws for the church's health and pre&s;ervation, &s;ays Prov. xxix. 15. <HI>"The rod and reproof give wi&s;dom; but a child left to him&s;elf, bringeth his mo|ther to &s;hame."</HI> Therefore, 17th ver&s;e adds <HI>"correct thy &s;on."</HI> And the &s;ame divine councel &s;ays, <HI>"he that &s;pareth the rod, hateth his &s;on".</HI> Prov. xiii. 24. And, be &s;ure, the want of &s;uch mea&s;ures ruined <HI>Eli's</HI> Hou&s;e I. Sam. ii. 13. As &s;urely then, as <HI>"the reproofs of in&s;truction are the way of life,"</HI> Prov. vi. 23. So &s;urely, family in&s;truction and government, are a mean appointed by God, to pre&s;erve and perpetuate his church upon earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another mean for accompli&s;hing the de&s;ign of the covenant of grace, and the la&s;t I &s;hall name is eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline. For as family di&s;cipline is for the members of the family; &s;o church di&s;cipline is for all the members of the church.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="45" REF="020921_0044_0FB14D78037B9DE8">
1. If then the children of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, are in the outward court of the covenant of grace; and &s;o under its out|ward admini&s;tration; then they are within the pale of the vi|&s;ible church. The former has been proved, and the latter follows of cour&s;e. The common objection is, then they ought to partake of all ordinances; but 'tis not &s;o. An infant heir at law, has right to an e&s;tate; or a crown; but he can't inherit, and po&s;&s;e&s;s it, 'till of lawful age. So a baptized infant member of the church, can't actually enjoy full communion 'till evidence of knowledge, faith, and holine&s;s, qualifies him according to the laws of the vi&s;ible church. II. Cor. xiii. 5. <HI>Examine your&s;elves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own &s;elves.</HI>" And all who can do this, may eat and drink I. Cor. xi. 28. 'Tis certain that all circumci&s;ed children of old, were of the vi&s;ible church. For in the fir&s;t in&s;titution of that ordi|nance, God gave a rule to run through all ages of the law &mdash; <HI>"The uncircumci&s;ed manchild, &s;hall be cut off from his people"</HI> Gen. xvii. 14. But he could not be cut off from the church by want of circumci&s;ion, unle&s;s circumci&s;ion con&s;tituted member&s;hip. And the P&s;almi&s;t who knew the nature of church &s;tate, in tho&s;e days, &s;ays P&s;al. cii. 28. <HI>"The children of thy &s;ervants &s;hall continue, and their &s;eed &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before thee."</HI> But as God is the &s;ame, his mind the &s;ame, the church the &s;ame, and the covenant on which it &s;tands the &s;ame; &s;o of cour&s;e children are in the outward court of the church now. And to this purpo&s;e, the apo&s;tle is quite full. <HI>"The ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham"</HI> Part of which was circumci&s;ion of his &s;eed, and their con&s;equent priviledges; <HI>"is come on the gentiles;"</HI> that is on us now; <HI>"through Je&s;us Chri&s;t"</HI> Gal. iii. 14. The apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> therefore had good rea&s;on to preach to vi&s;ible chri&s;tians. <HI>The promi&s;e is to you and to your children.</HI> Act. ii. 39.</P>
<P N="2">2. As all baptized children are in the outward court of the church; &s;o of right, they are under the care, over&s;ight &amp; di&s;cipline of the church; ju&s;t as children of a private fami|ly, are, as to their Parents. And as 'tis of dangerous con&s;e|quence, for Parents to neglect this duty; &s;o 'tis for a church to neglect the di&s;cipline of her baptized members. This kind of conduct ruined <HI>Eli's</HI> hou&s;e. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;at an ex|ample for his church, when in giving Peter charge about his fold, he e&s;pecially commands him to feed his lambs; but feeding implies government. Yea, Chri&s;t him&s;elf took young children in his arms. Mar. x. 16. And as the out door mem|bers of his church, be&s;towed a covenant ble&s;&s;ing on them, and was much di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed, 14th ver&s;e.&mdash;As certainly therefore, as jewi&s;h children, were within the pale of the church, and under its government; as has been proved; &s;o certainly are baptized children now. So Act. iii. 25, tells us, <HI>"ye are the children of the covenant, God made with the fathers, &s;aying to</HI> ABRAHAM, <HI>in thy &s;eed, &s;hall all the kingdoms of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed;"</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="020921_0045_0FB14D7974C50C68">
3. If God claims the children of his people, as his children and &s;ervants; then they are jubject to the di&s;cipline, which he has in&s;tituted in his church; but he does &s;o claim them. For he &s;ays, Ezek. xvi. 21. "<HI>Thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed my children to pa&s;s through the fire,</HI> viz. to <HI>Molock, thy &s;ons and thy daughters which thou ha&s;t born to me.</HI>" 20th ver&s;e. And in Lev. xxv. 41, 42. <HI>"They are my &s;ervants."</HI> Al&s;o, P&s;al. cxxv. 3 <HI>"Chil|dren are the heritage of the Lord."</HI> But heritage, is character for the church. Joel iii. 2. Therefore they are as &s;urely &s;ub|ject to the di&s;cipline of God's Hou&s;e, the church; as that there is any di&s;cipline there. Or as children and &s;ervants are under di&s;cipline in a family.</P>
<P N="4">4. If God owns the &s;ame relation to children in the church, as to their parents there; then they are equally under di&s;cipline there; but he does own the &s;ame relation; Ezek. xviii. 4. <HI>"All &s;ouls are mine, as the &s;oul of the father, &s;o al&s;o the &s;oul of the &s;on is mine."</HI> And the following words inflict puni&s;hment equally on both, in ca&s;es of di&s;obedience.&mdash;Therefore the children of the church, are equally &s;ubject to di&s;cipline, as parents there.</P>
<P N="5">5. All per&s;ons, in the vi&s;ible church are, as to their &s;tand|ing in the kingdom of Chri&s;t; but as the branch and the &s;tock belong together; &s;o 'tis ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e their children, given to God in bapti&s;m, are in the kingdom of &s;atan, as to their outward relative &s;tanding; yet 'tis evident, the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and that of &s;atan include all. Therefore children given to God in bapti&s;m, and &s;o being of the Church, as to their relative &s;tanding, are of cour&s;e under the in&s;pection and di&s;cipline of the church.</P>
<P N="6">6. If bapti&s;ed children are not of the church, and &s;o un|der di&s;cipline, the church will not be able to give account ac|cording to Heb. ii. 13. <HI>"Behold I and the children which God hat given me."</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. If the known and allowed di&s;tinction, of vi&s;ible and in|vi&s;ible church, is founded on matter of fact, then there are tho&s;e truly of the church who are not of it, as a &s;piritual and invi&s;ible body. And as the bible teaches, and it has been prov|ed, that baptized children are of the church; &s;o the&s;e are of it as vi&s;ible in di&s;tinction from the &s;piritual and invi&s;ible &s;tate of that corporation; and of cour&s;e &s;uch children are objects of the care and government of the church as a &s;piritual and truly chri&s;tian corporation.</P>
<P N="8">8. If all di&s;ciples are of the church, and &s;ubject to di&s;ci|pline, then baptized children are &s;o; Act. xv. 10, calls tho&s;e di&s;ciples who actually endured circumci&s;ion; but in general, only children were circumci&s;ed from <HI>Abraham</HI> to the apo&s;tles; and we have proved bapti&s;m, to be in place of cir|cumci&s;ion. As therefore circumci&s;ed children were di&s;ciples then; 'tis equally evident that baptized ones are &s;o now; and of cour&s;e, they are of the church, and under its in&s;pection
<PB N="47" REF="020921_0046_0FB14D7AFB123CF8">and di&s;cipline. For 'tis the claim of all corporations, to gov|ern and regulate their own &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="9">9. If the church in both &s;tates of it, had one and the &s;ame lord and head; and he changeth not, Mal. iii. 6, but is of one mind, and none can turn him. Job xxiii. 13. Then as evidently as we find circumci&s;ed children, under the over|&s;ight and di&s;cipline of his church formerly; &s;o certainly bap|tized ones, are equally under in&s;pection and government of the church now. But the apo&s;tle a&s;cribes the calling and forming of both &s;tates of his church to the &s;ame head and lord. Rom. ix. 24: Therefore &s;ubjects of the chri&s;tian cir|cumci&s;ion are equally under the in&s;pection and di&s;cipline of the church now.</P>
<P N="10">10. If <HI>Abraham,</HI> the father of believers did <HI>"command his children and hou&s;ehold after him, to keep the way of the Lord."</HI> Then 'tis the duty of a chri&s;tian church, as con&s;i&s;ting of his children, to copy the example of that patriarch. But he did do &s;o; and God approved him in it. Gen. xviii. 19. There|fore a chri&s;tian church, as <HI>Abraham's</HI> children, ought to fol|low his &s;teps.</P>
<P N="11">11. If for baptized children to be under di&s;cipline in the church, is one mean to form them for &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the chri&s;t|ian church, and other u&s;eful offices; then 'tis the will of God, and the duty of the church, to exerci&s;e it; but 'tis as evidently one mean for tho&s;e ends; as training up a child in the way he &s;hould go, is a mean of his walking in it af|terward. According to Prov. xxii. 6.</P>
<P N="12">12. If when God &s;aid, "<HI>I will be a God to thee and thy &s;eed.</HI> Gen. xvii. 7. Heb. viii. 10. He did at lea&s;t &s;ecure all outward ble&s;&s;ings and privileges, to the children of the faithful; then, if the over&s;ight and regulation of a chri&s;tian church, in the government of their children, is a ble&s;&s;ing and privilege; it was the de&s;ign of God originally, and of cour&s;e, the duty of the church, &s;o to treat their baptized children. But the former is true, and &s;o of cour&s;e mu&s;t be the latter.</P>
<P N="13">13. If &s;uch care and government, is implied in God's be|ing the God of <HI>Abraham's</HI> &s;eed, which includes believers children; then they are under &s;uch care and government in the church; for be &s;ure, God has government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> all that are in covenant with him.
