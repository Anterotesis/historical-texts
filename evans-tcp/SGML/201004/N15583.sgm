<P>IT has &s;eemed good to me to reque&s;t thy atten|tion to the following ob&s;ervations upon the Fall of Antichri&s;t, and the Concomitant Events.&mdash; The&s;e matters are of va&s;t importance to thee, as well as to the re&s;t of mankind, and I &s;hall be happy if thou receive&s;t &s;atisfaction from any of my writings.</P>
<P>Though there are many circum&s;tances upon which I wi&s;h to engage thy attention, there is one which I think de&s;erves the particular re|gard of every wi&s;e and pious Sovereign. I mean the unlimited toleration of the Jews. It is &s;aid in &s;cripture <HI>(Deut. chap. xxx,)</HI> that when the race of I&s;rael &s;hall return unto the Lord their God, that then he will gather them from all nations whither they have been &s;cat|tered into the land which their fathers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed, and will put on their enemies and tho&s;e who per&s;ecute them, the cur&s;es which they their&s;elves have known.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t place in &s;cripture, where we read of the power which &s;hould per&s;ecute the &s;aints for the &s;ake of religion (which power is ge|nerally called Antichri&s;t) is in the Prophet Daniel. In his vi&s;ion of the four bea&s;ts, by which he means four great empires that were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon earth (which vi&s;ion is de&s;canted upon by the learned I&s;aac Newton, in his commentaries upon that Pro|phet) he &s;ays, "Behold a fourth bea&s;t, dreadful and terrible, and &s;trong exceedingly, and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and &s;tampt the re&s;idue with the feet of it, and it was diver&s;e from all the bea&s;ts that were before it, and it had ten horns. I con&s;idered the horns, and behold there came up among them another little horn" Daniel vii. 7, 8. And again he &s;ays, "The&s;e great bea&s;ts which are four, are four kings which &s;hall ari&s;e out of the earth, ver&s;e 17. And again, "I beheld, and the &s;ame horn made war with the &s;aints, and prevailed again&s;t them," ver&s;e 21. And again he &s;ays, "And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that &s;hall ari&s;e; and another &s;hall ari&s;e after them, and he &s;hall be diver&s;e from the fir&s;t, and &s;hall &s;ubdue three kings. And he &s;hall &s;peak great words again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, and &s;hall wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and think to change times and laws; and they &s;hall be given into his hand until a time, and times, and the dividing of time. But the judgment &s;hall &s;it, and they &s;hall take away his dominion to con&s;ume, and to de&s;troy it unto the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom un|der the whole heaven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High; who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and all dominions &s;hall &s;erve and obey him," ver&s;e 24, 25, 26, and 27.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019875_0004_0FAD451F0FD7B9A0">
Newton conceives that this fourth kingdom is the Roman empire; but that it does not, in the mind of the Prophet, take in any provinces, excepting &s;uch which con&s;titute its own body, that is, the the Roman empire in Europe, or, the we&s;tern empire. The fir&s;t kingdom is that of Chaldea and A&s;&s;yria, the &s;econd Media and Per&s;ia, the third Greece. The ob&s;erva|tions of Newton upon this &s;ubject, which are inge|nious, would appear perhaps to many a candid mind to be founded on truth, and to be &s;atisfactory to prove that the power of Antichri&s;t is to ari&s;e in the we&s;tern part of the Roman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pire, if we were only enlighten|ed by the prophecies of Daniel. St. John however ren|ders it indi&s;putable, that this Antichri&s;tian power is to appear in the we&s;tern part of the Roman empire, for he makes its feat in the very city of Rome it&s;elf. He repre&s;ents this power under the emblem of a bea&s;t that hath &s;even heads, Rev. xvii. 3; and like Daniel, mentions that the bea&s;t hath ten horns. The former prophet mentions a little horn which &s;hall ari&s;e after the other ten, by which he means the power of Antichri&s;t. The latter prophet repre&s;ents the &s;ame power under the emblem of a harlot, who &s;its "upon a &s;carlet-coloured bea&s;t, having &s;even heads and ten horns," Rev. xvii. 3. Soon after he &s;ays, "The &s;even heads are &s;even mountains

It affects us with &s;urpri&s;e and horror when we con&s;ider the prevalence of &s;uch a portentous &s;courge
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Dr. Geddes, in giving an account of an act of faith, &s;ays, "The pri&s;oners are no &s;ooner in the hands of the civil magi|&s;trate than they are loaded with chains before the eyes of the inqui&s;itors, and being carried fir&s;t to the &s;ecular jail, are within an hour or two brought from thence before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, who, without knowing any thing of their particular crimes, or the evidence that was again&s;t them, a&s;ks them one by one, "In what religion they do intend to die." If they an&s;wer they will die in the communion of the church of Rome, they are condemned by him "to be carried forthwith to the place of execution, and there to be fir&s;t &s;trangled, and after|wards burnt to a&s;hes." But if they &s;ay "they will die in the Prote&s;tant," or in any other faith, that is contrary to the Ro|man, they are then &s;entenced by him "to be carried forthwith to the place of execution, and there to be burnt alive." At the place of execution, which at Li&s;bon is the Ribera, there are &s;o many &s;takes &s;et up as there are pri&s;oners to be burnt, with a dry quantity of furz about them. The &s;takes of the profe&s;&s;ed, as the inqui&s;itors call them, may be about four yards high, and have a &s;mall board, whereon the pri&s;oner is to be &s;eated, within half a yard of the top. The negative and re|lap&s;ed being fir&s;t &s;trangled, and burnt, the profe&s;&s;ed, go up a ladder betwixt the two Je&s;uits which have attended them all day, and when they are come even with the forementioned board, they turn about to the people, and the Je&s;uits &s;pend near a quarter of an hour in exhorting the profe&s;&s;ed to be re|conciled to the church of Rome; which if they refu&s;e to be, the Je&s;uits come down, and the executioner a&s;cends, and hav|ing turned the profe&s;&s;ed off the ladder upon the &s;eat, and chain|ed their bodies clo&s;e to the &s;take, he leaves them, and the Je|&s;uits go up to them a &s;econd time, to renew their exhortation to them, and at parting tell them, "that they leave them to the devil, who is &s;tanding at their elbow to receive their &s;ouls, and carry them with him into the flames of hell fire &s;o &s;oon as they are out of their bodies." Upon this a great &s;hout is rai&s;|ed, and as &s;oon as the Je&s;uits are off the ladder the cry is, "Let the dogs beards, let the dogs beards be made," which is done by thru&s;ting flaming furzes fa&s;tened to a long pole, again&s;t their faces. And this inhumanity is commonly conti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned until their faces are burnt to a coal, and is always accom|panied with &s;uch loud acclamations of joy as are not to be heard upon any other occa&s;ion: a bull fea&s;t or a farce being dull entertainment to the u&s;ing "a profe&s;&s;ed heretic" thus inhu|manly. "The profe&s;&s;eds' beard being thus made," or trimm'd as they call it, in jollity, fire is &s;et to the furzes which are at the bottom of the &s;take, and above which the profe&s;&s;ed are chained &s;o high, that the top of the flame &s;eldom reaches higher than the &s;eat they &s;it on; and if there happens to be a wind to which that place is much expo&s;ed, it &s;eldom reaches &s;o high as their knees. So that though, if there be a calm, the profe&s;&s;ed are commonly dead in about half an hour after the furze is &s;et on fire; yet if the weather prove windy, they are not after that dead in an hour and an half or two hours, and &s;o are really roa&s;ted and not burnt to death. But though, out of hell, there cannot be a more lamentable &s;pectacle than this, being joined with the &s;ufferers (&s;o long as they are able to &s;peak) crying o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, Mi&s;ericordia por Amor de Dios, "Mercy for the love of God:" yet it is beheld by people of both &s;exes, and all ages, with &s;uch tran&s;ports of joy and &s;atisfaction, as are not on any other occa&s;ion to be met with."</P>

<P>There are &s;ome who imagine that the 1260 years of papal u&s;urpation begin at the clo&s;e of the &s;ixth century, and that Gregory the Fir&s;t, who was at that time Pope, had &s;ome marks of Antichri&s;t. Some conceive they begin at the opening of the &s;eventh century, when the Emperor Pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as made certain conce&s;&s;ions to the Pope. Others think they begin at the year 756, or thereabout, when, upon the de|&s;truction of the Exarchate of Ravennah, the Pope became a temporal monarch. Others, among whom are &s;aid to be Lowman and the celebrated I&s;aac New|ton, &s;uppo&s;e that the days of papal u&s;urpation begin at the year of our Lord 736, when Pepin of France made a grant to the Pope of the temporal dominion of Rome, upon the de&s;truction of the Exarchate of Ravennah, to which that city for a while belonged. The period of the Pope's continuance then, accord|ing to their &s;uppo&s;itions, will end about the year 2016, or if prophetical years be u&s;ed in the computation, con&s;i&s;ting of 300 years, about the year of our Lord 2000, which they &s;uppo&s;e will be the beginning of
<PB N="10" REF="019875_0008_0FAD4526305C95B0">the millennium. The celebrated Mede, whom &s;ome conceive to have been at times divinely in&s;pired con|cerning his comments upon the book of Revelation, was of opinion that the ten kingdoms aro&s;e in the we&s;tern part of the Roman empire in the year 476. It is probable that Mede is nearly right in his con|ception upon this matter, and that Antichri&s;t aro&s;e not a very long time after the above mentioned year.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">If we allow &s;eventy years for the ri&s;e of Antichri&s;t after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ten kingdoms in the we&s;tern part of the Roman Empire, the millennium will commence &s;oon after 1806. If we add 476 and 70 to 1260, they will make 1806. If we allow one hundred years for the ri&s;e of Antichri&s;t, the millennium will commence &s;oon after 1836. In this manner will our ideas of the commencement of the millennium vary according to the time that we allow for the ri&s;e of Antichri&s;t.</NOTE> There is a very forcible argument that I think may be urged to prove that the power of Antichri&s;t will be &s;oon aboli&s;hed. St. John, after de&s;cribing the bea&s;t with &s;even heads and ten horns (which we in|terpret to be the papal power) &s;ays, "And I beheld another bea&s;t coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake as a dragon: and he exerci&s;eth all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t before him, and cau&s;eth the earth and them which dwell therein, to wor&s;hip the fir&s;t bea&s;t who&s;e deadly wound was healed," Rev. xiii. 11, 12.

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here are manife&s;tly two di&s;tinct bea&s;ts, and therefore the prophet is willing to delineate two di&s;tinct things.

Now it is certain that the Je&s;uits who have been called the Janizaries of the See of Rome, have been bani&s;hed

<P>It &s;eems to be expre&s;ly foretold that the power of Antichri&s;t is to continue 1260 years, and that at the expiration of this time, the city of Rome, where this power is &s;eated, is to be made a de&s;olation. It is &s;aid in the Revelation, chap. xviii. "And after the&s;e things I &s;aw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightned with his glory. 2 And he cried mightily with a &s;trong voice, &s;aying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and

Ezekiel, &s;peaking of Tyre, which was made de&s;olate according to his prophecy, &s;ays, "And I will cau&s;e the noi&s;e of thy &s;ongs to cea&s;e, and the &s;ound of thy harps &s;hall be no more heard.

We read in this &s;ame chapter of Joel, "Put ye in the &s;ickle, for the harve&s;t is ripe, come get you down, for the pre&s;s is full, the fats over|flow, for their wickedne&s;s is great.

This pa&s;&s;age of Joel &s;eems to corre&s;pond with the following pa&s;&s;age in Revelation. "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one &s;at, like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in

And the angel thru&s;t in his &s;ickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and ca&s;t it into the great wine-pre&s;s of the wrath of God. And the wine-pre&s;s was trodden," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Revelation xiv. ver&s;e 14. The pa&s;&s;age in Joel corre&s;ponds in a great mea&s;ure with the pa&s;&s;age in Revelation, though the annihilation of the Turki&s;h empire will be &s;ub&s;equent to the fall of Antichri&s;t and the de&s;olation of Rome.

We read in Daniel, that after the Turki&s;h empire &s;hall be aboli&s;h|ed, when "he &s;hall come to his end, and none &s;hall help him," that "at that time &s;hall Michael &s;land up, the great Prince which &s;tandeth for the children of thy people; and there &s;hall be a time of trouble, &s;uch as never was &s;ince there was a nation, even to that &s;ame time: and at that time, &s;hall thy people be delivered, every one that &s;hall be found written in the book.

Is there not a di&s;tinction made between reward and puni&s;hment? Is not this to judge? This pa&s;&s;age in Daniel &s;eems to corre&s;pond with the following pa&s;&s;age in Matthew. "When the Son of man &s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then &s;hall he &s;it upon the throne of his glory. And before him &s;hall be gathered all nations; and he &s;hall &s;eparate them one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats: And he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

The appearance of our Saviour will be per&s;onal, after the annihilation of the Turki&s;h empire and the re&s;to|ration of Judea, becau&s;e there will then be a re&s;urrec|tion and a judgment. It is &s;aid in Acts, "And when he had &s;poken the&s;e things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their &s;ight. And while they looked &s;tedfa&s;tly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men &s;tood by them in white apparel; which al&s;o &s;aid, Ye men of Galilee, why &s;tand ye gazing up into heaven? this &s;ame Je&s;us which is taken up from you into heaven, &s;hall &s;o come, in like manner as ye have &s;een him go into heaven," chap. i. ver. 9, 10, 11. It is here &s;aid, that our Sa|viour &s;hall come IN LIKE MANNER as he went into heaven. He went into heaven in the form with which he was crucified, and with which he ro&s;e again from the dead. Thomas, the doubting di&s;ciple, after his re&s;urrection, had examined that form. He found that he could thru&s;t his hand into his &s;ide, and put his finger into the print of the nails. He found that it was THE LIVING JESUS whom he had known in per&s;on.</P>

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome who conceive that by Chri&s;t's reign of a thou&s;and years on earth, is meant nothing more than the pre|valence of the go&s;pel in &s;ingular purity for that period of time.

<P>The long-wi&s;hed for day is at hand, when "great Babylon will come in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fiercene&s;s of his wrath," Rev. xvi. 19. "The abomination that maketh de&s;olate," Dan. xi. 31, the &s;tandard of Ma|homet, will &s;oon be hurled in indignation from the terri|tory of the holy people. The Lord &s;hall &s;oon "utter his voice before his army," Joel ii. 11. For the day, the white-winged day, is at hand, that day in which there will be joy with the good on earth, as well as with the ble&s;t in heaven, when the race of I&s;rael will be brought once more exultant into the land of their forefathers. The time is coming, as the prophet foretold, Ezekiel xxxvii, when the dry bones will &s;hake and come together, bone to his bone, and the &s;inews and the fle&s;h will come upon them, and the &s;kin will cover them above, and the breath will come into them, and they will live and &s;tand upon their feet an exceeding great army. The grave will &s;oon give up its dead, and &s;oon we may expect in per&s;on the awful appearance of our Judge and our Redeemer, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is now therefore that un|appalled by danger, and un&s;educed by ea&s;e and ambi|tion, we &s;hould bear the unadulterated go&s;pel of our Saviour in thunder
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"And he &s;urnamed them Boanerges, which is the &s;ons of thunder," Mark iii. 17.</NOTE> over an a&s;toni&s;hed world. It is now that God will claim his own over that earth which he hath created. He is a God of ju&s;tice, as well as
<PB N="28" REF="019875_0026_0FAD4534DCA688A0">of mercy. He will not be trifled with. He will have his laws obeyed. It is nobly &s;aid of him by his prophet, "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me: I kill and I make alive: I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven and &s;ay, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering &s;word, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood," (Deuteronomy.) It is right and &s;it that the will of the Almighty &s;hould be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Where are the &s;ervants of the Lord then? are they afraid? or are they indolent? Do they not know that he has &s;et his King, his King, our Lord and Saviour, upon his holy hill of Zion? In vain &s;hall earth, &s;hall hell oppo&s;e. The decree is gone forth, and is now fulfilling, which &s;ays, "A&s;k of me and I &s;hall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion," P&s;alm ii. The labourers are now comparatively few in regard to the fields which are white unto harve&s;t It is now that the &s;ervants of the Lord &s;hould peculi|arly exertt hem&s;elves. It is now that his Spirit (which he will give to all who a&s;k it properly) will power|fully attend their well-de&s;igned endeavours. They &s;hould remember that "they who turn many to righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, will &s;hine forth as the &s;tars for ever," (Daniel.) And he, who has heaven for his throne and earth for his foot&s;tool, will be in&s;tant concern|ing them; he will be "a wall or fire round about them, and the glory in the mid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them," (Zecha|riah.)</P>
<P>We read in Revelation, that when the &s;eventh an|gel founds, and "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign for ever and ever," that then God will "de&s;troy them which de&s;troy the

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The vi&s;ion of I&s;aiah and of Mieah, where it is mentioned, that the nations "&s;hall beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks," &s;eems to have been mi&s;un|der&s;tood by Barclay and others. This glorious vi&s;ion appears to refer to the time when the Jews &s;hall be gathered from all nations into the holy land, and when Chri&s;t &s;hall have entered into his reign for a thou&s;and years. No &s;trong nations have yet exhibited that pacific di&s;po&s;ition which the prophets fore|tell. Micah &s;ays, "But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and to I&s;rael his &s;in. Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the hou&s;e of Jacob, and princes of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. They build up Zion with blood, and Jeru&s;alem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the prie&s;ts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and &s;ay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Therefore &s;hall Zion for your &s;ake be plowed as a field, and Jeru&s;alem &s;hall become heaps, and the mountain of the hou&s;e, as the high places of the fore&s;t. But in the la&s;t days it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that the mountain of the hou&s;e of the Lord &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the top of the mountains, and it &s;hall be exalted above the hills, and people &s;hall flow unto it. And many nations &s;hall come and &s;ay, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the hou&s;e of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law &s;hall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeru&s;alem. And he &s;hall judge among many people, and rebuke &s;trong nations afar off, and they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks: nation &s;hall not lift up a &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more. But they &s;hall &s;it every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none &s;hall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of ho&s;ts hath &s;poken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. In that day, &s;aith the Lord, will I a&s;&s;emble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; and I will make her that halted, a remnant, and her that was ca&s;t far off, a &s;trong na|tion; and the Lord &s;hall reign over them in mount Zion, from benceforth even for ever." See Micah from chap. iii. ver. 8, to chap iv. ver. 8; and I&s;aiah, chap. i, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If we con&s;ider al&s;o the words in the 65th chapter of I&s;aiah, "they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my holy mountain, &s;aith the Lord," with the preceding words in the &s;ame chapter, which &s;eem to corre&s;pond with the concluding words in the prophet Amos, we &s;hall find that the prophecy in regard to the holy mountain refers to the time when the Jews &s;hall be gathered from among all nations, and re&s;tored to the land of their forefathers.</P>
<P>After the reign of Chri&s;t for a thou&s;and years Satan will "be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on," the expedition of Gog and Magog will then be made again&s;t the holy city; and afterwards there will "be no more cur&s;e," Rev. xxii. 3, and man will be re&s;tor|ed to the paradi&s;iacal &s;tate. If we con&s;ider therefore the whole &s;cheme of the providence of the Deity as exhibited towards the human race, we &s;hall find that it is altogether worthy of that Being who is perfectly wi&s;e and good. "Allchaiah: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and rejoice, and give honour to him." Rev. xix. 6, 7.</P></NOTE> It &s;eems then rea&s;onable that Chri&s;tians &s;hould re&s;i&s;t evil more at this time, than at the fir&s;t aera of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. For if God is de&s;irous that tho&s;e &s;hould be de&s;troyed who de&s;troy the earth, will he not make his &s;ervants the in&s;truments of &s;uch de&s;truction? To turn the other cheek to him who &s;mites on the right, and to give the cloak where the coat is unlawfully taken away, appear not to be commands which are eternally binding on the &s;ervants
<PB N="30" REF="019875_0028_0FAD45364D1CA0E0">of the Lord. If God for ever made his &s;un to ri&s;e with the &s;ame indulgence on the evil and the good, and for ever &s;ent his rain on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t in the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hing manner, he could not his&s;elf be ju&s;t, and wi&s;e, and good; which it is bla&s;phemous to ima|gine. We &s;hould not con&s;ider the &s;cripture partially, but generally. We &s;hould not attend only to the Go&s;|pel of St. Matthew, but to the Revelation of St. John. In the Revelation we read, "And I &s;aw hea|ven opened, and behold a white hor&s;e; and he that &s;at upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth judge and make war.

And I &s;aw the bea&s;t, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war again&s;t him that &s;at on the hor&s;e, and again&s;t his army. And the bea&s;t was taken, and with him the fal&s;e prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the bea&s;t, and them that wor&s;hipped his image. The&s;e both were ca&s;t alive into a lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone. And the remnant were &s;lain with the &s;word of him that fat upon the hor&s;e, which &s;word proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their fle&s;h," chapter xix, ver&s;e 11, to the end.</P>
<P>It is true, that our Saviour before Pilate &s;ays, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants &s;ight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence," John, chap xviii. ver. 36. At the time of our Saviour's appearance upon earth, it was determined, by Providence, that he &s;hould &s;uffer. His

But when the kingdoms of the world become the king|doms of the Lord and of his Chri&s;t, then there will be more occa&s;ion for the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t to fight. In &s;hort, I think the temporal &s;word may be u&s;ed by Chri&s;tians, but that we &s;hould take care not to u&s;e it as the &s;word of unju&s;t revenge, ambition, or of any bad pa&s;&s;ion, that we &s;hould u&s;e it, as we &s;hould u&s;e every other thing, AGREEABLY TO THE WILL OF THE AL|MIGHTY.</P>
