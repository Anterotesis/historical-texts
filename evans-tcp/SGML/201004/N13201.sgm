<HEAD>A Conci&s;e Refutation, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THIS government, A&s;toni&s;hed at the late extra|ordinary claims of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to the territory of Vermont, and the following remarks having been omitted in any piece heretofore publi&s;hed on the &s;ubject, find them&s;elves under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of publicly expo&s;ing the imbecility, and depravity of tho&s;e governments, who&s;e candour, on the very fir&s;t attempt, &s;hould have &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that in pro&s;ecuting &s;uch claims, they would unavoidably become accomplices with the government of New-York, in their many aggravated and long continued oppressions of the people of this State. This government &s;en&s;ible of the devices of certain leading gentlemen of the government of New-York again&s;t them, and being appri&s;ed that they had &s;ometime &s;ince propo&s;ed to certain leading gentlemen in the States of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, to divide this State among the three States a|fore&s;aid, which are now actually claiming it &s;everal|ly, and &s;en&s;ible likewi&s;e of our danger from the fron|tier &s;ituation to the Province of Quebec, and of the
<PB N="4" REF="016694_0003_0F9D7830335382D8">influence which the government of New-York (e&s;pe|cially if corrobarated by tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay) might have in the Congre&s;s of the United States, in which we have not been re|pre&s;ented. The&s;e apprehen&s;ions excited this govern|ment to remon&s;trate at the General Courts of New Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, again&s;t their making and pro&s;ecuting &s;uch claims, which, in their nature and tendency, are cruel, unju&s;tifiable and with|out any rea&s;onable foundation for their &s;upport:&mdash;And having received &s;everal acts of Congre&s;s of the 24th of September la&s;t, among which is contained a recommendation to the &s;everal States of New Hamp|&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-York, to pa&s;s laws expre&s;sly authorizing the Grand Council of America to hear and determine the differences which have &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them, on one part, and the inhabitants of a di&s;trict of country called the New Hamp&s;hire Grants (as they are plea&s;ed to term them) on the o|ther, on the fir&s;t day of February next; and a cita|tion (only) to the inhabitants of the latter to choo&s;e Agents and otherwi&s;e prepare for the hearing afore&s;aid; have therefore thought it expedient to exhibit to the world, and to the honorable Congre&s;s, as a very re&s;|pectable part of it, the apparent impropriety of tho&s;e claims.</P>
<P>AND fir&s;tly, we &s;hall con&s;ider the preten&s;ion; of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. It is admitted that previous to the adjudication of the boundary line in 1739, be|tween New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, the latter had claimed a con&s;iderable part of the pre&s;ent juri&s;diction of New-Hamp&s;hire, from the atlantic ocean on the ea&s;t part, (which claim did equally in|terfere with the territory now in di&s;pute) and in lon|gitude
<PB N="5" REF="016694_0004_0F9D7830E1C5B4C8">through the main land to the &s;outh &s;ea, on the we&s;t part, as de&s;cribed in the charter of the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. This antiquated claim of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay was refered to the King and Coun|cil, by an appeal from a Court of Commi&s;&s;ioners previou&s;ly authorized by the &s;ame authority to de|termine, and mark out the boundaries between the &s;aid two Provinces; as may appear from the follow|ing extract of the &s;ettlement of that line, viz.</P>
<P><Q>AND whereas appeals from the determination of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, have been &s;aid before his Maje&s;ty, by the Agents for the re&s;pective Provin|ces of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire; which &s;aid appeals have been heard before the Committee of Council for hearing appeals, from the plantations, who, after having con&s;idered the whole matter, and heard all parties concerned therein, did report unto his Maje&s;ty as their opini|on, that the northern boundary of the &s;aid Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay are, and be, a &s;imilar curve line, pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of Merimack River at three miles di&s;tance on the north &s;ide thereof, be|ginning at the Atlantic ocean, and ending at a point due north of a place (in a plan returned by &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners) called Pantucket Falls; and a &s;traight line drawn from thence due we&s;t cro&s;s the &s;aid river till it meets with his Maje&s;ty's other governments; which &s;aid report of the Commit|tee of Council, his Maje&s;ty hath been plea&s;ed with the advice of his Privy Council to approve, and to declare, adjudge and order, that the northern boundary of the &s;aid Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay are and be a &s;imilar curve line, pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of Merimack River at three miles di&s;tance,
<PB N="6" REF="016694_0005_0F9D7831A28280D0">on the north &s;ide thereof, beginning at the atlan|tic ocean, and ending at a point due north of a place in the plan returned by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion|ers called Pantucket-Falls; and a &s;trait line drawn from thence due we&s;t cro&s;s the &s;aid river, till it meets his Maje&s;ty's other governments.</Q> This adjudication was made in 1739, which was forty years ago, and the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay have regulated their juri&s;diction accordingly ever &s;ince; which is too notorious to be di&s;puted, and may be further illu&s;trated by a variety of acts of their own, as well as of the Briti&s;h government; one of them re&s;pects Fort-Dummer, which was built by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay Province in 1724, and gar|ri&s;oned at their expence a number of years; but upon its being excluded from their juri&s;diction by the &s;ettlement of the boundary line afore&s;aid, the Bay Province repre&s;ented to the government at home, that the &s;aid di&s;trict of land claimed as afore&s;aid, and Fort-Dummer, having been determired to be the property of New-Hamp&s;hire, they were no longer obliged to garri&s;on and maintain it; and praying, that as it was nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of that part of the country, that New-Hamp&s;hire might be di|rected to &s;upport it. In con&s;equence of which, an order pa&s;&s;ed the King and Council in 1744, as fol|lows, viz. <Q>That the Governor and Commander in Chief of New Hamp&s;hire &s;hould forthwith move the A&s;&s;embly, in his Maje&s;ty's name, to make a provi&s;ion for that &s;ervice;</Q> and at the &s;ame time informing them, <Q>that in ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to com|ply with &s;o rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary a propo&s;al, his Maje&s;ty would find him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring that fort, with a proper di&s;trict of land contiguous to it, to the province of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,
<PB N="7" REF="016694_0006_0F9D7832633B2270">who cannot (with ju&s;tice) be re|quired to maintain a fort no longer within their boundary.</Q> In con&s;equence of this requi&s;ition New-Hamp&s;hire did actually maintain Fort Dum|mer, and paid a demand of arrears for its previous &s;upport, to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; and the receipt thereof remains in the Secretary's office of New-Hamp&s;hire to this day.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e &s;olemn governmental tran&s;actions, and actual compliance of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to the &s;aid royal adjudication, their preten&s;ions to the ju|ri&s;diction of Vermont appears to be not only imper|tinent but arbitrary; and &s;hould &s;uch a precedent take place, would make an end to all juri&s;dictional limitations through the United States, as well as tho&s;e of Vermont; as in this ca&s;e no antient &s;ettle|ment of boundary lines re&s;pecting them could be valid, and con&s;equently, the greate&s;t confu&s;ions and di&s;orders would nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue. Furthermore, if there be any thing in tho&s;e preten&s;ions of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, they equally affect the actual juri&s;diction of New Hamp&s;hire to the ea&s;tward of Connecticut river, over which ea&s;tern part, when Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay &s;hall exerci&s;e their juri&s;diction, it will be early enough for them to do the &s;ame over an equal width of the juri&s;diction of Vermont. After all, provided there be any reality in tho&s;e preten&s;ions, there is a great deal in them, as they are founded on a charter right, and con&s;equently challenge the right of &s;oil. This the principal gentlemen of their court gave our Agent to under&s;tand, that they demanded, with juri&s;diction; which opens another &s;cene of expence to the inhabitants (provided their pretended claim takes place). This will undoubtedly be di&s;plea&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="016694_0007_0F9D78332208C4C0">to the pre&s;ent occupents, their lands having been (the greater part of them) already granted by New-Hamp|&s;hire and New-York; but there is no probability of &s;atisfying the many unwarrantable and avaricious claims of the &s;everal contending governments, the citizens of Vermont, therefore judge it rea&s;onable to reject them.</P>
<P>THIS government have &s;uch a &s;acred regard to the occupency of land within their juri&s;diction, that they would not wi&s;h to have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and occupents di&s;turbed in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: notwith&s;tanding &s;uch lands may have been appropriated by either of the contending governments (New-York not excepted).</P>
<P>WE come now to the con&s;ideration of the preten&s;i|ons of New-Hamp&s;hire to the juri&s;diction of Vermont, by introducing the &s;ettlement of the boundary line between them and New-York, as follows, viz.</P>

<P>PROBABLY the advocates for the preten&s;ions of the claim of New-Hamp&s;hire to this territory, will ad|vert to the 47th and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> pages of our vindication of the right of the inhabitants of Vermont, to form into an independent State; where we &s;hew the nul|lity of the &s;aid adjudicated line of 1764, in con&s;e|quence of the declaration of independence of the United States, and the annihilation of the Briti&s;h government in America; a&s;&s;erting, that in con&s;e|quence of our arguments alluded to as afore&s;aid, they open a door for the claim of New-Hamp&s;hire to take place, by making void that line, in order to defeat the claim of New-York. The attention of
<PB N="10" REF="016694_0009_0F9D7834A190F4E0">the reader is reque&s;ted very particularly to the fol|lowing ob&s;ervations, viz. The territory of Vermont, until the people's declaration of independence, was extra-provincial land, and the governments of New-Hamp&s;hire and New-York claimed the juri&s;diction of it by turns, merely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure of the King, as neither of the&s;e govern|ments were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any charter right, as a body politic, which they could call their own, or challenge in their own right. Had New-Hamp&s;hire been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a charter-right, their claim would have been more re&s;pectable and permanent, and would have operated again&s;t the adjudication of 1764 afore|&s;aid, provided &s;uch boundaries had been previou&s;ly a&s;certained: But this di&s;puted territory being in tho&s;e times crown lands, and without the limits of any of the (then) colonies or plantations, the King's autho|rity over it was therefore ab&s;olute; and while this power remained in being, the la&s;t royal decree was valid and binding, which was that of 1764 afore&s;aid, which extended the juri&s;diction of New-York over the &s;aid territory; at which time the claim of New-Hamp&s;hire to the premi&s;es became extinct and fini&s;h|ed; nor is it in their power to renew their claim to this government, being wholly de&s;titute of any char|ter right thereto, and having lo&s;t it by the &s;ame ar|bitrary power by which alone they acquired it, and therefore ought to be finally &s;ilent about it, as well as on account of their own relinqui&s;hing of &s;uch claim, and not affording the inhabitants any protection or juri&s;dictional &s;upport for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years; but &s;ince the declaration of the independence of this State, have not only relinqui&s;hed their &s;aid claim by their governmental tran&s;actions, explicitly acknowledging the independence of this State: The proper creden|tials
<PB N="11" REF="016694_0010_0F9D7835632D2468">of this la&s;t fact will be exhibited in the follow|ing &s;heets, with &s;ome further illu&s;tration:&mdash;Be|ing at pre&s;ent impatient to ob&s;erve, that as the claim of New-Hamp&s;hire to this territory was nullified, and became extinct, in con&s;equence of the royal de|cree of 1764 afore&s;aid, as before argued; and as the claim of New-York to this territory was equally de|ficient as that of New-Hamp&s;hire, to any charter right as a body politic, or inherent con&s;titutional juri&s;diction; the claim of New-York therefore only &s;urvived that of New-Hamp&s;hire from the arbitrary decree of 1764, to the glorious aera of AMERICAN LIBERTY and INDEPENDENCE, which was declared the fourth day of July 1776, and then expired al&s;o, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the free citizens of Ver|mont, who, in con&s;equence thereof, reverted to a &s;tate of nature, and have &s;ince formed government on the true principles of liberty.</P>
<P>THIS royal arbitrary line in the time of the kingly power was in the nature of it incompatible with the rights of a free people as they were thereby dive&s;ted of the ine&s;timable privilege of choo&s;ing their own form of government, and of electing their chief ma|gi&s;trates; nor were they in &s;uch circum&s;tances, in any condition, to know what form or alteration of go|vernment might next take place, as the King and his creatures were the &s;ole arbitrators of it. In fine, this people have &s;uffered every indignity and oppre&s;&s;ion, that prodigal and lucrative governors, and their &s;warm of hungry dependants could invent, and carry into execution; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing, that any per&s;ons that live in the&s;e days of liberty, &s;till entertain any idea that the &s;aid boundary line &s;hould operate in favour of the claim of New-York. From this &s;hort
<PB N="12" REF="016694_0011_0F9D783621B322E0">review of the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire, they cannot effect the claim of Vermont to independence; which may be further illu&s;trated by a two fold argument, viz. provided tho&s;e adju|dicated boundary lines of 1739 and 1764 afore&s;aid, be deemed authentic and valid, their claims to Ver|mont mu&s;t be con&s;idered as nugatory and abortive; but on the other hand, if tho&s;e adjudicated lines, be con&s;idered as null and void, in this ca&s;e the claim of Vermont to the juri&s;diction of this territory, would be much better grounded, than the&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay or New-Hamp&s;hire, ina&s;much as their govern|ment hath for a long time been formed by the autho|rity of the people at large, or their legal repre&s;enta|tives, who under God have a natural and indi&s;puta|ble right to form their own governments; &s;o that the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire to this territory, are bar'd either by the afore&s;aid ad|judication, or in con&s;equence of the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of the government of Vermont, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any one, or both of tho&s;e governments, to &s;et up a third principle, whereby they can deduce a legal or ju&s;t claim to any part of this government; for if their claims are not founded on the lines formerly a&s;cer|tained by the Briti&s;h government, or the free con&s;ent and mutual a&s;&s;ociation of the people of this territory, their preten&s;ions are frivolous, or tyrannical. This two fold argument is not viewed as being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to defeat the claims of tho&s;e go|vernments to the &s;aid premi&s;es; but was introduced by way of &s;upererogation, &s;ufficient it is in order to vindicate the claim of independence of the State of Vermont, again&s;t tho&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire; that the&s;e governments have for a &s;eries of years conformed to tho&s;e &s;ettlements of 1733
<PB N="13" REF="016694_0012_0F9D783769B229F0">and 1764 in their legi&s;lative and executive capacities, and acted uniformly agreeable to tho&s;e limitations, till within a few months la&s;t pa&s;t. Sundry years be|fore the commencement of the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h war with the colonies, the people of this territory repeat|edly &s;olicited both of tho&s;e governments, at different times, to extend their governmental protection to them, and prevent the ruin with which they were threatned by the oppre&s;&s;ive iron rod of the government of New-York, but could obtain none. But it ap|pears by their late claims, that they have &s;ince alter|ed their minds, altho' their motives herein (it is pre|&s;umed) are far from being honorable&mdash;for it is a great fundamental and univer&s;al principle in all free go|vernments, that government and protection are in&s;e|perably connected together; &s;o that without protecti|on, or at lea&s;t an attempt to extend it when earne&s;tly &s;olicited as afore&s;aid, government naturally and ne|ce&s;&s;arily cea&s;es to be; or in other words, &s;uch a re|fu&s;al of protection implicitly di&s;avows any right of juri&s;diction, or forfeits any &s;uppo&s;ed right either by neglecting &s;uch claim, or refu&s;ing &s;uch protection: From whence we may infer, that all pretenders to government, which have not ultimately the good of the governed in view, and do not afford, or endeavour to afford protection to tho&s;e over whom they pretend &s;uch claims, &s;hould in&s;tead of the re&s;pects due to le|gi&s;latures, courts and the like, be e&s;teemed and treat|ed as enemies to &s;ociety and the rights of mankind. Thus it appears from the great and mo&s;t univer&s;ally received maxim in all free governments, that the citi|zens of Vermont are and ought to be independent of the three governments which lay claim to them; and that every of their &s;aid preten&s;ions are dating u&s;urpa|tions and in&s;ults on the liberty of an independent,
<PB N="14" REF="016694_0013_0F9D7837A219FB00">brave and free people, who have never received any governmental protection or benefit from either of them; but in&s;tead thereof, have every thing to appre|hend from their venality and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>HAD New-York &s;ucceeded in their various and in|&s;iduous attempts to &s;ubjugate the people of Vermont, the recent claims of tho&s;e other governments would never have been mentioned, and the juri&s;diction of New-York over this territory would, at this day, have been indi&s;putable; &s;o that Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire have taken advantage of the controver&s;y between New-York and Vermont, and even of the bravery of the latter in defending their natural rights and liberties, as the only po&s;&s;ible ground of laying their frivilous claims. They have furthermore taken the advantage of the bravery of the United States in general, and Vermont likewi&s;e, in bringing about the pre&s;ent revolution, by which means they dare extend their pretended claims, which it is pre&s;umed they would not have had the hardi|ne&s;s to do under the Briti&s;h government, over the head of tho&s;e royal adjudications of 1739 and 1764 afore&s;aid; and it is worthy a remark, that the&s;e claims have been &s;tarted about three years &s;ince the decla|ration of the Independence of the United States. Still the people of Vermont, legally &s;peaking, re|mained under the Briti&s;h government (over which Governor Philip Skeene was commi&s;&s;ioned chief ma|gi&s;trate, and next to this government, has the be&s;t claim to the juri&s;diction of Vermont,) from the 4th day of July 1776, to the 15th day of January next following, and then in a &s;olemn manner di&s;avowed the Briti&s;h government, and rejected the preten&s;ions of Mr. Skeene, and all other pretenders to the juri&s;|diction
<PB N="15" REF="016694_0014_0F9D7838616CAFB8">of this territory, and declared them&s;elves a FREE and INDEPENDENT STATE; and have, as they humbly conceive in their various &s;truggles for liber|ty, fairly merited the enjoyment of it.

<P>HIS Excellency the Governor having laid before the Council for their advice, two letters from his Excellency Governor Tryon, of New-York, dated October 1771, and December 23, 1771, the latter enclo&s;ing a proclamation, al&s;o a copy of his Ex|cellency's an&s;wer to the fir&s;t letter. The premi&s;es being read, it is con&s;idered, that by his Maje&s;ty's order in Council of the 20th of July, 1764, the we&s;tern banks of Connecticut River was then commanded to be the we&s;t bounds of this Province; and that this government has been, and is entirely obedient thereto. Therefore, the &s;aid proclamati|on relating wholly to matters and things without the boundaries of this province, it is advi&s;ed that the publication therefore, by the authority of this province, is extra provincial, and therefore in our opinion improper, and that his Excellency is further advi&s;ed not to i&s;&s;ue any proclamation relating to the premi&s;es. Secondly, that it is not expedient for the government in any wi&s;e to interfere with, or concern in runing the lines between his Maje&s;ty's

IT is pre&s;umed that from the &s;ettlement of the boundary line between New-York and New-Hamp|&s;hire in 1764, to the date of Pre&s;ident <HI>Weare's</HI> letter of the 22d Augu&s;t afore&s;aid, which is more than four|teen years, that New-Hamp&s;hire (during this period) had given up, in the mo&s;t explicit and public man|ner, all preten&s;ions to the juri&s;diction of any and eve|ry part of the lands comprehended in this State.&mdash;Governor <HI>Benning Wentworth's</HI> proclamation afore|&s;aid, &s;ets this matter in a clear light, &s;oon after the alteration of juri&s;diction, directing the &s;ettlers under New-Hamp&s;hire to conform to the laws of New-York. The letter from the Governor of New-Hamp&s;hire to Governor Tryon, of the 19th of Oc|tober 1771, &s;peaks the &s;ame language, viz. <Q>That he had invariably recommended implicit obedi|ence to the laws of New York, and upon all occa&s;ions po&s;itively di&s;avowed any connection with tho&s;e people.</Q> The Governor and Council of New-Hamp&s;hire the 8th day of January 17, 2, wholly renounced their claim to the premi&s;es: <Q>It is con&s;idered that by his Maje&s;ty's order in Coun|cil of the 20th of July 1764, the we&s;tern banks of Connecticut river was then commanded to be the we&s;t bounds of this province; and that this government has been entirely obedient thereto.</Q> Pre&s;ident Weare's letter to Ira Allen, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> proceeds &s;till further, and po&s;itively conceeds to the indepen|dence of this State. It appears that the Court of the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, by their Pre&s;ident, addre&s;s him in his official character, viz. as <Q>Secretary of the State of Vermont;</Q> and in the contents of the letter, when writing to the Secretary of this State, not le&s;s than three times gives it the appella|tion or &s;tile of "your State;" and ob&s;erves in the
<PB N="23" REF="016694_0022_0F9D783ED5FBF5D0">fini&s;hing clau&s;e of the letter, <Q>In behalf of the Council and A&s;&s;embly, I am,</Q> &amp;c. From all which it appears, that the &s;aid letter has the autho|rity of the General Court of that State for its &s;up|port; and which, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, ac|knowledgeth the independence of this State, which is of it&s;elf a final bar to the claim of New-Hamp|&s;hire: For, if governments can relinqui&s;h their claim of juri&s;diction when they plea&s;e, and a&s;&s;ume it again at plea&s;ure, the whole notion of governmental juri&s;|diction is reduced to a mere romance, and nothing permanent, obligatory or binding in it; and there|fore &s;uch a precedent is inadmi&s;&s;ible, as it would, if admitted to become general, de&s;troy all order and decorum in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be acknowledged that the court of New-Hamp&s;hire, through the channel of their Pre&s;ident's letter to Governor Chittenden, before in&s;erted, offer|ed a number of rea&s;ons relative to the impropriety of this State's taking into union &s;ixteen towns ea&s;t of Connecticut river; which rea&s;ons are equally con|clu&s;ive again&s;t the claim of New Hamp&s;hire to the we&s;tward of the &s;ame river. Says Mr. <HI>Weare,</HI> their Pre&s;ident, <Q>Is there any a&s;certaining the bounda|ries between any of the United States of America, but by the lines formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the au|thority of Great-Britain? I am &s;ure there is not.</Q> This being admitted, we are equally &s;ure New-Hamp&s;hire has no right to any territorial juri&s;diction to the we&s;tward of &s;aid river. Notwith&s;tanding it appears that the court of New Hamp&s;hire, in the fir&s;t place, plead the &s;ettlement of the line in 1764, as the main ground of their title to tho&s;e &s;ixteen towns afore&s;aid, (we&s;t of the Ma&s;on line) by which
<PB N="24" REF="016694_0023_0F9D783F23886F80">means they are included in their juri&s;diction, and in a few months afterward break over the &s;aid line or 1764, and lay claim to the State of Vermont; when at the &s;ame time nothing can be more apparent than that the &s;ame arguments by which they e&s;tabli&s;h their claim to tho&s;e &s;aid &s;ixteen towns ea&s;t of the ri|ver, effectually bass their claim to the we&s;tward of the &s;ame river, and leaves the conte&s;ted territory to be di&s;puted between New-York and Vermont. <Q>I am &s;urpri&s;ed,</Q> &s;ays the Pre&s;ident, that "they," &s;peaking of the inhabitants of this State, <Q>&s;hould &s;upply their enemies with arguments again&s;t them, by their connecting them&s;elves with people (hav|ing reference to tho&s;e &s;ixteen towns) who&s;e circum|&s;tances are wholly different from their own, and who are actually members of the State of New-Hamp&s;hire.</Q> This la&s;t clau&s;e affirming that the inhabitants of tho&s;e &s;ixteen towns were actually members of the State of New-Hamp&s;hire; at the &s;ame time implicitly affirms that the inhabitants on the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid river were not; which is ful|ly explained in the preceeding part of the &s;ame pa|ragraph, viz <Q>who&s;e circum&s;tances are wholly dif|ferent from their own,</Q> that is, the members of the State of Vermont; which is &s;till further explain|ed from another paragraph of the &s;ame letter, when, after &s;tating the facts relative to the afore&s;aid union with tho&s;e &s;ixteen towns before frequently mentioned, &s;ays, <Q>on which I am directed to repre&s;ent to you, and to de&s;ire it may be laid before the repre&s;enta|tives of your people.</Q> As this was addre&s;&s;ed to the Governor of Vermont, from the court of New-Hamp&s;hire, to be laid before their repre&s;entative bo|dy, or General A&s;&s;embly, in which the claim of New-Hamp&s;hire is clearly &s;et up, and their right vindi|cated
<PB N="25" REF="016694_0024_0F9D783FE1588B78">to a number of towns, over which Ver|mont on a mi&s;taken and wrong repre&s;entation had encroached; upon the repre&s;entation whereof, the General Court of the State of Vermont di&s;&s;olved the union as afore&s;aid; and agreeable to the claim and reque&s;t of the Court of the State of New-Hamp|&s;hire, relinqui&s;hed every connection, as a political body, with tho&s;e &s;ixteen towns ea&s;t of Connecticut river: And thus the re&s;pective governments of New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, having mutually &s;ettled their boundary line on the we&s;t banks of Connecticut river, agreeable to the adjudication thereof in 1764, between New-York and New-Hamp&s;hire, cannot fail of operating as a final bar again&s;t any &s;ub&s;equent claim of New Hamp&s;hire to any part of the State of Vermont: For, New Hamp&s;hire madetheir claim, and Vermont very readily clo&s;ed with them, and gave them their whole demand, in which the minds of both governments met, and the di&s;pute naturally and nece&s;&s;arily ended; and it is but chil|drens play for New-Hamp&s;hire to make a &s;econd demand on the State of Vermont; for if one &s;ettle|ment is not deci&s;ive and binding, neither would a &s;econd, or a third, and &s;o on <HI>ad infinitum.</HI></P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay and New Hamp&s;hire to Vermont, the &s;implicity of the inhabitants of this government, and their veneration for Congre&s;s was &s;o great, that it is highly probable that they would have very frankly &s;ubmitted the long controver&s;y between them and New-York, to the final deci&s;ion of the Congre&s;s of the United States; though at the &s;ame time they were far from an opinion that Congre&s;s had any legal, inherent or con&s;titutional right (exclu&s;ive of their own con|&s;ent
<PB N="26" REF="016694_0025_0F9D7840ABE296B0">and approbation) &s;o to do: But, the recent claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Hamp&s;hire, in concert with New-York, and it is &s;u&s;pected in confederacy with each other to divide this State among tho&s;e three governments, has excited their apprehen&s;ions; for though it may not prove a tri|ple league as is imagined, it is at lea&s;t a &s;trong com|bination of intere&s;ts, which will undoubtedly agree in the ruin of this State, whatever di&s;putes may happen between them&s;elves relative to the juri&s;dic|tion thereof. And as to the States of Virginia, North-Carolina and South-Carolina, who&s;e territo|ries are immen&s;ely large, and who&s;e intere&s;ts it is to maintain their re&s;pective &s;overeignty's over their exten&s;ive claims, which may in natural probability influence their delegates in Congre&s;s to oppo&s;e the independence of Vermont; as it may in future ope|rate as a precedent to divide tho&s;e large territories into different States, (not that it is apprehended by us that there are any &s;imilarity in the circum&s;tances of this tract of country to any other part of Ameri|ca;) and thus from views of their own particular intere&s;ts, be very partial and bia&s;&s;ed judges of the right of Vermont to independence; and in&s;tead of judging on the principles of ju&s;tice and equity which re&s;pects Vermont, as oppo&s;ed to the claims of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, New Hamp&s;hire and New-York, may rather determine the matter agreeable to their own ambition and intere&s;t; &s;o that were Ver|mont to calmly &s;ubmit their indubitable claim of in|dependence to Congre&s;s, though they are as re&s;|pectable a body as the world ever produced, it would be by no means certain that Vermont could have an impartial tryal; as there may be many con|nections of intere&s;ts very prejudicial to them, which
<PB N="27" REF="016694_0026_0F9D7841DE77CE00">at pre&s;ent we cannot conceive of, and which is out of our power to come at the knowledge of, as this State is not repre&s;ented in Congre&s;s. The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, and as the freemen of this State have never had any voice in electing, forming or creating Congre&s;s, as a political body, or had any repre&s;entation therein; but have been rather mi&s;|repre&s;ented. And whereas this State hold their charter of liberty from heaven, and not <Q>of man, or of the will of man,</Q> have upon a full and can|did examination and con&s;ideration determined not to &s;ubmit HEAVEN-BORN FREEDOM to the arbitra|ment of any tribunal below the &s;tars, which through infirmity might deprive them of it: But, as they have clo&s;ely embraced it in the mo&s;t critical and hazardous times, are determined to hold it fa&s;t, ex|cept it be torn from them by the hand of power; which re&s;olution we tru&s;t will be ju&s;tified by the court of heaven and commended by all true friends to the liberty and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
