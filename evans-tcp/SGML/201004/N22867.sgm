<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO MR. WILLIAM PLAYFAIR, AUTHOR OF THE HISTORY OF JACOBINISM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;eldom known a greater plea&s;ure than I now feel, in rendering you my thanks, in this public manner, for your &s;pirit|ed efforts in the cau&s;e of order and <HI>true</HI> liberty. Your work, Sir, has met with the approbation of all who have read it on this &s;ide the Atlan|tic, the enemies of mankind excepted; and, as to my&s;elf, I pre&s;ume I could not give a more unequivocal proof of my high opinion of it, than by &s;ubmitting it to the peru&s;al of the peo|ple of the United States of America.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the American Jacobins, com|monly denominated Democrats, which I have attempted in the following pages, &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upply a deficiency, which, undoubt|edly, is to be attributed to your want of au|thenticated materials. I am well aware, that
<PB REF="030209_0003_0FF12C43338C4618">
the reader will, at every &s;tep, regret that this part of the ta&s;k al&s;o did not fall to your lot; but, the experience I have had of the indul|gence of the public, emboldens me to tru&s;t to it once more, though under the enormous di&s;|advantage of following &s;uch a writer as Mr. Playfair.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN JACOBINS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the Jacobins of Paris &s;ent forth their mi&s;&s;i|onaries of in&s;urrection and anarchy, their profe&s;&s;|ed object was to enlighten the ignorant and unchain the en&s;laved. There was &s;omehitng prepo&s;terous in the idea of Frenchmen giving liberty to the world; but, had it been po&s;&s;ible for men in their &s;en&s;es to be|lieve, that a club of di&s;tracted Mon&s;ieurs, who knew not the meaning of the word liberty, were calcu|lated for this arduous ta&s;k and were &s;erious in their profe&s;&s;ions, &s;uch credulous per&s;ons mu&s;t have been at once undeceived, when they ob&s;erved, that the newly-enlightened mi&s;&s;ionaries were di&s;patched to tho&s;e countries alone where the greate&s;t degree of civil liberty was already to be found. Had the Propa|gande at Paris been &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ions, why were not their envoys directed towards Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey, in&s;tead of England, America, and other free &s;tates? The fact is, Bri&s;&s;ot and his philanthropic colleagues wanted to draw as many foreign nations as po&s;&s;ible within the vortex of their own &s;avage
<PB N="8" REF="030209_0005_0FF12C4B2CAF7400">
&s;y&s;tem, and they well knew, that where the voice of the people has the mo&s;t weight in public affairs, there it is mo&s;t ea&s;y to introduce novel and &s;ubver&s;ive doc|trines.</P>
<P>In &s;uch &s;tates too, there generally, not to &s;ay al|ways, exi&s;ts a party, who, from the long habit of hating tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the government, become the enemies of the government it&s;elf, and are ready to &s;ell their treacherous &s;ervices to the fir&s;t bidder. To this de&s;cription of men the &s;ect of the Jacobins have attached them&s;elves, in every country they have been &s;uffered to enter. They are a &s;ort of fle&s;h flies, that naturally &s;ettle on the excremental and corrupted parts of the body politic. It is well known what aid they have received from the di&s;affected of &s;everal European na|tions; but, neither the Malcontents in Geneva, the Patriots in Holland, nor the Reformers in Great Bri|tain and Ireland, were half &s;o well adapted to the re|ception of Jacobinical doctrines and Louis d'ors as the <HI>Anti-federali&s;ts</HI> in America. This faction was co-exi&s;tent with the General Government of the Union. Notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing this go|vernment, and its mild and equitable principles, it did not fail to meet with a formidable oppo&s;ition. The per&s;ons who compo&s;ed this oppo&s;ition, and who thence took the name <HI>Anti-federali&s;ts,</HI> were not equal to the Federali&s;ts, either in point of riches or re&s;pectability. They were, in general, men of bad moral characters, embarra&s;&s;ed in their private affairs, or the tools of &s;uch as were. Men of this ca&s;t naturally feared the ope|ration of a government endued with &s;ufficient &s;trength to make it&s;elf re&s;pected, and with &s;ufficient wi&s;dom to exclude the ignorant and wicked from a &s;hare in its admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Anti-federali&s;ts</HI> attracted notice, and acquired con&s;equence. A hypocritical anxiety for the pre&s;ervation of the liberties of the people made up for a want of every real virtue. Some of the &s;tates re|fu&s;ed, for a long time, to accede to the new Confe|deration,
<PB N="9" REF="030209_0006_0FF12C50419E17D0">
and many individuals, in tho&s;e &s;tates which did accede to it, remained ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ed to its principles.</P>
<P>Thus did the Federal Government receive, at its birth, the &s;eeds of a di&s;ea&s;e, which, unle&s;s its friends di&s;cover more zeal than they have hitherto done, will one day accompli&s;h its de&s;truction. It began its career in defiance of a party, organized and mar&s;halled, and ready to &s;eize the favourable moment for attacking it with open force. We &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that this moment was at no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The happy effects of the new &s;y&s;tem, which were almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly felt, operated &s;o forcibly on the minds of the people at large, that the Anti-federali&s;ts began to feel them&s;elves aba&s;hed. Seeing their num|bers daily dimini&s;h, they found it prudent to hide their di&s;content; nor would their clamors have &s;ince been revived, had they not been encouraged and backed by the u&s;urpers in France. The &s;ucce&s;sful example, the promi&s;es, and, above all, the gold of the&s;e latter, have emboldened them again to &s;hew their heads; as the rays of the &s;un draw the adder from the loath&s;ome retreat, where he has lain engen|dering and bloating over his poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The French u&s;urpers, from the moment they had got a firm gra&s;p of the reins of power, lo&s;t no time in engaging this de&s;perate faction in their views, which were, to acquire a perfect command of the American government, and force it into the war of Liberty and Equality. Mon&s;ieur Ternant, the then amba&s;&s;ador here, was, be&s;ides his being &s;ent by a king, very ju&s;tly looked upon as unfit for managing the intrigues of Bri&s;&s;ot and his brother regicides. He had ever been accu&s;tomed to live on terms of friend&s;hip with the officers of government, and to treat their communications with becoming re&s;pect. Citizen Ge|net was therefore di&s;patched to &s;upply his place: a man every way qualified for the million he had to ex|ecute.
<PB N="10" REF="030209_0007_0FF12C531566B6C8">
Educated in the &s;ubaltern walks of the mo&s;t intriguing court in Europe, he was ver&s;ed in all the menial offices of corruption; and unencumbered with the family pride of the French Chevaliers, he could vi&s;it a democratic club, and give the fraternal bu&s;s to its &s;hirtle&s;s members, with that kind of cordiality, which gives a ze&s;t to flattery, and &s;eldom fails to gain the affections of the grovelling heart. If the Citizen has hitherto failed of ultimate &s;ucce&s;s, we mu&s;t attri|bute his failure to the deep penetration and inflexible integrity he had to encounter, rather than to any want of cunning, indu&s;try or <HI>liberality</HI> on his part.</P>
<P>The attachment of the Federal Government to a pacific &s;y&s;tem was well known in France. Genet was therefore in&s;tructed, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not be able to &s;hake this attachment either by promi&s;es or threats, to apply him&s;elf to the &s;overeign people them&s;elves, who&s;e partiality, it had been repre&s;ented, and with but too much truth, had received a &s;trong bias in fa|vour of the u&s;urpers. In order to pave the way for acting in the la&s;t re&s;ort, he di&s;embarked at a point the mo&s;t di&s;tant from the &s;eat of government, that he might have it in his power to act on &s;ome part of the people at lea&s;t, before the &s;entiments of their govern|ment re&s;pecting him and his mi&s;&s;ion were known. He accordingly landed at Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, where he remained caballing for &s;ome time, and then proceeded to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Charle&s;ton, and, indeed, of mo&s;t parts of South Carolina, were admirably di&s;po&s;ed for a warm reception of Genet. Not long before his land|ing, a propo&s;ition had been publi&s;hed for a &s;olemn abo|lition of the u&s;e "of all ari&s;tocratical terms of <HI>di&s;|tirction</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect.</HI>" The levellers had even propo&s;|ed having an engagement to this effect, printed and &s;tuck up in the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">et-places, court-hou&s;es, &amp;c. for the &s;ignature of the citizens. In a &s;tate where &s;ans|culotti&s;m had already made &s;uch a progre&s;s, the ani|mating pre&s;ence of the Pari&s;ian Mi&s;&s;ionary was all
<PB N="11" REF="030209_0008_0FF12C561001A800">
that could be wanted to complete the farce. The Carolinians had cut the &s;trings of their culottes, and the Citizen pulled them down about their heels.</P>
<P>The frigate, L'Ambu&s;cade, that brought Genet to America, brought al&s;o the news of war being de|clared by France again&s;t England. The inhabit|ants of Southern climes have never been famous for their wi&s;dom; accordingly, the people of Charle&s;|ton looked upon a prize, which the Ambu&s;cade brought in with her, as an earne&s;t of &s;ucce&s;s, and an indubitable indication of French naval &s;uperi|ority.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Genet on &s;hore, than he began to exerci&s;e his powers, as &s;overeign of the country. He commi&s;&s;ioned land and &s;ea officers, to make war upon the Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h; he fitted out privateers, and opened rendezvou&s;es for the enrolling of both &s;oldiers and &s;ailors. The French flag was &s;een waving from the windows in this &s;ans-culotte city, ju&s;t as if it had been a &s;ea-port of France. Genet was &s;ent expre&s;sly to engage the country to take a part in the war, and &s;uch was his contempt for the government, that he did not look upon its con&s;ent as a thing worth a&s;king for, or thinking about.</P>
<P>The Citizen found more volunteers than he knew what to do with, particularly of the higher ranks: Cap|tains and Commodores, Majors and Colonels, flocked to his &s;tandard in &s;uch crowds, that had he had a hundred reams of paper in blank commi&s;&s;ions, he might have filled them all up in the State of Carolina. Whether the&s;e men of high rank and empty pur&s;es were en|couraged by the confidence they had in the power of the French, or by their own in&s;tinctive bravery, I know not; but as to the end they had in view, there can be little doubt. For one of them, who was actuated by a love of liberty, there were five hundred who were actuated by a love of plunder. Some of them longed for a dive into the Spani&s;h mines, and, in idea,
<PB N="12" REF="030209_0009_0FF12C5A95648830">
already heard the chinking of the doubloons; while others were eyeing the Briti&s;h merchant-men with that kind of &s;avage de&s;ire, with which the wolf &s;urveys a herd of fat oxen.</P>
<P>After having remained at Charle&s;ton from the 9th to the 19th of April 1793, the <HI>Sans-culotte corps Di|plomatique,</HI> marched off for Philadelphia, where it ar|rived on the 9th of May.</P>
<P>I avoid mentioning the proce&s;&s;ions, banquets, &amp;c. that attended the Citizen during his journey; nor &s;hould I think it worth while to give an account of his reception at the capital, were I not a&s;&s;ured that the civilians of the Rights of Man will hereafter quote it as a precedent in the laws of their ceremonial.</P>
<P>The city had been duly prepared for this famous public entry by paragraphs in the papers, announcing the Citizen's arrival at the different &s;tages on the road. Expectation was kept on tip-toe for &s;everal days. The be&s;t penmen among the patriots were at work com|po&s;ing congratulatory addre&s;&s;es, and their choice&s;t orators were gargling their throats to pronounce them. At la&s;t, on the happy 16th of May, a <HI>&s;alve</HI> from the cannons of a frigate lying in the port, gave notice that the Citizen would &s;oon be arrived a place called Gray's Ferry, about three miles di&s;tant from the ci|ty. Thither all the patrioticly di&s;po&s;ed went, to meet him, and e&s;cort him to his dwelling. In the evening of the &s;ame day there was, what was called, a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia, when it was agreed to appoint a committee to draft an addre&s;s to him. An addre&s;s was accordingly prepared, &s;ubmitted to the &s;overeign citizens, at a &s;econd meeting, highly approved of, and another committee, con&s;i&s;ting of about half a hundred per&s;ons, appointed to carry it up.&mdash; But I mu&s;t now avail my&s;elf of their own account of the bu&s;ine&s;s, feeling a total want of capacity to do it ju&s;tice. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Gazette of <HI>Poor Richard's Grand-Child,</HI> of the 20th of May 1793.</NOTE></P>
<Q><PB N="13" REF="030209_0010_0FF12C5CB7B99448"><P>The citizens a&s;&s;embled expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to accompany their committee in pre&s;enting the ad|dre&s;s to the Citizen mini&s;ter, two gentlemen were di&s;patched to know what time it would be conveni|ent for him to receive it, and they returned in a few minutes with the following report: "That Mr. Genet had expre&s;&s;ed a high &s;en&s;e of the com|pliment intended to be paid him by the citizens of Philadelphia; that he was &s;olicitous to avoid giving them the trouble of another meeting, and that if they would accept the &s;pontaneous effu&s;ions of his heart, which, however deficient in point of form, would not be deficient in &s;incerity, as an an&s;wer to the addre&s;s, he would be happy to receive it immediately, leaving to the en&s;uing day the cere|mony of a written reply."&mdash;"The citizens te&s;|tified their approbation of the mini&s;ter's propo&s;i|tion by <HI>reiterated &s;houts of applau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The committee, headed by their chairman, and followed by an immen&s;e body of citizens, walking three abrea&s;t, having arrived at the City-tavern, were introduced into the pre&s;ence, and after the <HI>acclamations, as well in the hou&s;e as in the &s;treets,</HI> had cea&s;ed, the addre&s;s was delivered, at the clo&s;e of which <HI>the hou&s;e and &s;treets again re&s;ounded with congratulations and applau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Citizen Genet, evidently <HI>affected with the warmth of the public attachment,</HI> thus conveyed, delivered an extemporaneous reply, in terms which <HI>touched the feelings</HI> of every auditor, &amp;c.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe, with adequate <HI>energy,</HI> the &s;cene that &s;ucceeded. <HI>Shouts</HI> and <HI>&s;alutations</HI> were not unat|tended with <HI>other evidences</HI> of the effect, which this int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters">ing interview had <HI>upon the pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the parties who were engaged in it.&mdash;From the citizens in the room the mini&s;ter turned his attention to the citizens in the &s;treet, and addre&s;&s;ed them in a few &s;hort but emphatic &s;entences, from one of the win|dows.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030209_0011_0FF12C5F28B222F8">In this in&s;tance we &s;ee the &s;overeign people taking the liberty to act for them&s;elves, while their &s;ervants, the officers of government, &s;tand looking on. What right, I would be glad to know, had the people of Phi|ladelphia, even &s;uppo&s;ing them all a&s;&s;embled together, to acknowledge any man as a public mini&s;ter, before he had been acknowledged and received as &s;uch by the General Government? No wonder that this in&s;olent mi&s;&s;ionary &s;hould conceive, that that government was a mere cypher; and many of tho&s;e who afterwards complained of his appeal to the people, &s;hould have recollected, that they had encouraged him &s;o to do.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after the Citizen's arrival, there was nothing but addre&s;&s;ing and fea&s;ting him. It may not be ami&s;s to give an account of one of the&s;e treats; the memory of &s;uch &s;cenes &s;hould be pre&s;erved, and often brought into view.</P>
<Q><P>On Saturday la&s;t a <HI>republican dinner</HI> was given at Oellers's hotel, to <HI>Citizen Genet,</HI> by a re&s;pectable number of French and American citizens. After dinner a number of patriotic toa&s;ts were drunk, of which the following is a tran&s;lation:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Liberty and Equality.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The French Republic.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The United States, &amp;c. &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After the third toa&s;t, an <HI>elegant ode,</HI> &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, compo&s;ed by a young Frenchman, was read by Citizen <HI>Duponceau,</HI> and univer&s;ally ap|plauded. The &s;ociety, <HI>on motion</HI> [to be &s;ure, <HI>on motion</HI>] ordered that <HI>Citizen Freneau</HI> &s;hould be re|que&s;ted to tran&s;late it into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, and that the original and tran&s;lation &s;hould be publi&s;hed.</P></Q>
<P><Q>After a &s;hort interval, the <HI>Mar&s;eillois's Hymn</HI> was, upon the reque&s;t of the citizens, &s;ung by Ci|tizen <HI>Bournonville,</HI> with great ta&s;te and &s;pirit, the <HI>whole company joining in the chorus.</HI></Q>&mdash; I leave
<PB N="15" REF="030209_0012_0FF12C61B562BB98">
the reader to gue&s;s at the harmony of this chorus, bel|lowed forth from the drunken lungs of about a hun|dred fellows, of a dozen different nations. Who would have thought five and thirty years ago, when the inhabitants of Penn&s;ylvania were petitioning King George for protection again&s;t the French and their allies, the &s;calping Indians, that in the year 1793, the people of Philadelphia would carry their complai|&s;ance to a French mini&s;ter &s;o far, as to ape his outland|i&s;h howling in the chorus of a murderer's &s;ong! But, let us proceed with the fea&s;t.&mdash;<Q>Two additional &s;tanzas to the <HI>Mar&s;eillois's Hymn,</HI> compo&s;ed by <HI>Citi|zen Genet,</HI> and &s;uited to the <HI>navy</HI> of France, were then called for, &s;ung, and encored.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Before the &s;inging of the Hymn, it &s;hould be mentioned, that a <HI>deputation from the &s;ailors</HI> of the frigate, L'Ambu&s;cade, made their appearance, <HI>em|braced,</HI> and took their &s;eats.</P>
<P>The table was decorated with the tree and cap of liberty, and with the French and American Flags. The la&s;t toa&s;t being drunk, the cap of li|berty was placed on the head of <HI>Citizen Genet,</HI> and then it <HI>travelled from head to head,</HI> round the table [ju&s;t as the guillotine has &s;ince travelled round France] each wearer enlivening the &s;cene with a patriotic &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The&s;e tokens of liberty, and of American and French fraternity, were delivered to the officers and mariners of the frigate, L'Ambu&s;cade, who promi&s;ed to defend them till death.</P></Q>
<P>Thus rolled Genet's time away, in a variety of &s;uch non&s;en&s;ical, &s;tupid, unmeaning, childi&s;h enter|tainments, as never were heard or thought of, till Frenchmen took it into their heads to gabble about liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030209_0013_0FF12C6464F9AED8">On the very day that this liberty-cap fea&s;t took place, the citizen mini&s;ter was formally received, and acknowledged in his diplomatic capacity, by the Pre|&s;ident of the United States. There, indeed, his re|ception was not quite &s;o warm. He afterwards com|plained, that the fir&s;t object that &s;truck his eye in the chamber, was the bu&s;t of Louis XVI. I never heard whether he &s;tarted back or not, at the &s;ight; but it is certain he looked upon it as an ill omen. He &s;aw that he had not to do with a man, who&s;e friend|&s;hip &s;hifted with the changes of fortune. He &s;aw that the Pre&s;ident had not been deceived by the ca|lumnies heaped on the unfortunate king; and that, though the welfare of his country induced him to receive an envoy from his murderers, he was far from approving of their deeds.</P>
<P>This &s;ilent reproof, which mu&s;t, however, be at|tributed to mere accident, &s;tung the in&s;olent Genet to the &s;oul. His re&s;enting it is a &s;triking in&s;tance of that overbearing &s;pirit which the rulers of the de|luded French have ever di&s;covered. Becau&s;e they had killed their king, hurled down the &s;tatues of his ance&s;tors, and dug their rotten bones from the tomb, they had the pre&s;umption to think, that the go|vernors of other nations ought to follow the &s;avage example.</P>
<P>But, a cold reception was not the rub that Genet mo&s;t complained of. The Federal Government, in|formed of his bold beginnings at Charle&s;ton, made no doubt that his in&s;tructions went to the engaging it in the war. Indeed the&s;e in&s;tructions were made known from the moment of his landing; and it can|not be doubted but this had influence on the conduct of the government; for an article appeared in the Charle&s;ton papers, the day after, &s;pecifying that a report had gained ground, that the Federal Go|vernment <HI>mu&s;t</HI> take a part in the war; and this arti|cle made its appearance at Philadelphia, on the very day that the Pre&s;ident's proclamation, declaring it the
<PB N="17" REF="030209_0014_0FF12C68DB111F78">
re&s;olution of the United &s;tates to remain neuter, was fir&s;t promulgated.</P>
<P>This wi&s;e and determined &s;tep Genet's ma&s;ters had not fore&s;een; or, if they did fore&s;ee it, they were not aware that it would be taken, before their mi&s;&s;ionary could find time to make his warlike pro|po&s;als. This was a mo&s;t cruel di&s;appointment to the Citizen, and completely baffled all his projects. In vain did he endeavour to draw the old General from his ground, neither promi&s;es nor threats had any effect on him, and Genet &s;oon found, that he had no hope but in rou&s;ing the people to oppo&s;e their go|vernment.</P>
<P>A man of more penetration than Genet might have conceived &s;uch a project fea&s;ible, from the vio|lent partiality that every where appeared towards the French, from the little re&s;pect te&s;tified for the opi|nion of the government, and particularly from the freedom, not to &s;ay audacity, with which its con|duct, in i&s;&s;uing the proclamation of neutrality, was arraigned. Be&s;ides, the Anti-federal faction began to appear with more boldne&s;s than ever. Genet was continually &s;urrounded with them; and, as they &s;igh|ed for nothing &s;o much as for war, they &s;trengthen|ed him in the opinion, that the people would ulti|mately decide in his favour.</P>
<P>But, there wanted &s;omething like a regular plan to unite their forces, and bring them to act in con|cert. A dinner here and a &s;upper there, were no|thing at all. The drunkards went home, &s;norted them&s;elves &s;ober, and returned to their employments. It was not as in France, where a &s;ingle tap upon a drum head, would a&s;&s;emble <HI>canaille</HI> enough to over|turn forty Federal Governments in the &s;pace of half a night. In America there exi&s;ted all the materials for a revolution, but they were &s;cattered here and there; affiliated clubs were wanting to render them compact, and manageable, as occa&s;ion might demand.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030209_0015_0FF12C6B870EFDD8">Genet did not judge it prudent to give to the American Jacobins the &s;ame name, that had been a&s;|&s;umed by tho&s;e in France: that would have been too glaring an imitation. <HI>Democratic</HI> was thought le&s;s offen&s;ive, at the &s;ame time that it was well adapted to a &s;ociety of men, who were about to &s;et them|&s;elves up for the watch-dogs of a government, which they pretended was already become <HI>too ari&s;tocratic,</HI> and was daily growing more &s;o; but that a Demo|crat was but another name for a Jacobin no one had the folly to deny, when, afterwards, &s;ome of the&s;e very clubs were known to &s;end petitions for having their names entered on the regi&s;ters of the Jacobin club at Paris.</P>
<P>The Mother Club, in America, met at Philadel|phia on the 3d of July, 1793, about &s;ix or &s;even weeks after Genet's arrival in the city, during which &s;pace, it is well a&s;certained, more than <HI>twenty thou&s;and Louis d'ors</HI> had been di&s;tributed.</P>

<P>Now, what was the object of all this balloting and corre&s;ponding and meeting? This we are to look for, they tell us, in their fir&s;t circular letter: here it is then.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have the plea&s;ure to communicate to you a copy of the con&s;titution of the <HI>Democratic Society,</HI> in hopes that after a candid con&s;ideration of its principles, and objects, you may be induced to pro|mote its adoption, in the county of which you are an inhabitant.</P>
<P>Every mind, capable of reflection, mu&s;t per|ceive, that the pre&s;ent cri&s;is in the politics of nati|ons is peculiarly intere&s;ting to America. The Eu|ropean Confederacy, tran&s;cendent in power, and unparalleled in iniquity, menaces the very exi&s;tence of freedom. Already its baneful operation may be traced in the tyrannical de&s;truction of the Con&s;titu|tion of Poland: and &s;hould the glorious efforts of France be eventually defeated, we have rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that, for the con&s;ummation of monarchical ambition, and the &s;ecurity of its e&s;tabli&s;hments, this country, the only remaining depo&s;itory of liberty, will not long be permitted to enjoy in peace, the honours of an independent, and the happine&s;s of a republican government.</P>
<P>Nor are the dangers ari&s;ing from a foreign &s;ource, the only cau&s;es, at this time, of apprehen&s;ion and &s;olicitude. The <HI>&s;eeds of luxury</HI> appear to have taken root in our dome&s;tic &s;oil: and the <HI>jealous eye of pa|trioti&s;m</HI> already regards the <HI>&s;pirit of freedom and equality,</HI> as eclip&s;ed by the <HI>pride of wealth</HI> and the <HI>arrogance of power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030209_0018_0FF12C74857844C0">This general view of our &s;ituation has led to the in&s;titution of the <HI>Democratic Society.</HI> A con&s;tant circulation of u&s;eful information, and a liberal com|munication of republican &s;entiments, were thought to be the be&s;t antidotes to any political poi&s;on, with which the vital principles of civil liberty might be attacked: for by &s;uch means, a fraternal confidence will be e&s;tabli&s;hed among the citizens; every &s;ymp|tom of innovation will be &s;tudiou&s;ly marked; and a &s;tandard will be erected, to which, in danger and di&s;tre&s;s, the friends of liberty may &s;ucce&s;sfully re&s;ort.</P>
<P>To obtain the&s;e objects, then, and to cultivate on all occa&s;ions, the love of peace, order, and har|mony; an attachment to the con&s;titution, and a re&s;pect to the laws of our country, will be the aim of the <HI>Democratic Society,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Never did a piece of political hypocri&s;y come forth to public view under &s;uch a flim&s;y di&s;gui&s;e as this cir|cular letter. People &s;tared to &s;ee that there were men among&s;t them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of impudence enough, thus to invite them to revolt again&s;t the con&s;titution, under the pretext of pre&s;erving it in its purity. The Ame|ricans can &s;wallow a pretty comfortable do&s;e of any thing that is &s;trongly &s;ea&s;oned with <HI>liberty and equality,</HI> but there were few, above the mere vulgar, who&s;e &s;tomachs did not turn at this.</P>
<P>How <HI>democratic &s;ocieties</HI> were to protect the coun|try again&s;t the monarchs of Europe &s;eemed a my|&s;tery. What &s;tandard were they to rai&s;e for the people to find &s;helter under, in the hour of danger and di&s;tre&s;s? Nothing is clearer, than that the com|bination was intended to operate again&s;t the General Government, and again&s;t that alone. They &s;et out with talking about the dangers to be apprehended from foreign powers, but they &s;oon come to the point; the &s;pirit of <HI>freedom and equality,</HI> they &s;ay, is eclip&s;ed by the <HI>pride of wealth</HI> and <HI>arrogance of power.</HI> It is
<PB N="22" REF="030209_0019_0FF12C76F004F030">
to combat the&s;e, that they invoke the aid of their fel|low citizens.</P>
<P>Indeed a political club, if it is not intended to &s;trengthen the government, mu&s;t be intended to act again&s;t it. The very foundation of &s;uch a club mu&s;t imply a &s;y&s;tematic oppo&s;ition to the lawful rules of the land; it is an act of rebellion, unpuni&s;hable by law 'tis true, but which will ever be puni&s;hed by the ab|horrence of all peaceable and hone&s;t men.</P>
<P>No one can read the concluding paragraph of this letter, without calling to mind the profe&s;&s;ions of the French and Engli&s;h Jacobins: the former united them&s;elves under the name of, <Q>Les Amis de la Con|&s;titution</Q> (the friends of the Con&s;titution), and the latter, under that of, <HI>"The Con&s;titutional Society."</HI> What &s;ort of <HI>friends</HI> to the Con&s;titution (of 1791) the Jacobins of Paris were, their &s;ub&s;equent conduct, and the &s;ate of that Con&s;titution, have fully proved; and it would be &s;inning again&s;t conviction to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e of England and America exceeded them in &s;incerity. The patriots, or <HI>reformers</HI> (call them which you plea&s;e) who emigrate from England, throw off the di&s;gui&s;e as &s;oon as their feet touch the &s;hore. They tell you, that their intention was to de&s;troy "the old rotten con&s;titution of Britain," from which they took their name; and there is not the lea&s;t doubt, but the Democrats would be as candid with re&s;pect to the American con&s;titution, were they landed in France.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who placed them&s;elves at the head of the Democrats, &s;peaking of them generally, they were very little e&s;teemed, either as private or public characters. Few of them were men of property, and &s;uch as were, owed their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;ome ca&s;ual circum&s;tance, rather than to family, indu&s;try, or ta|lents. The bulk of political reformers is always com|po&s;ed of needy, di&s;contented men, too indolent or impatient to advance them&s;elves by fair and hone&s;t

means, and too ambitious to remain quiet in ob&s;curity. Such, with very few exceptions, are tho&s;e who have appeared among the leaders of the American Jacobins. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>Officers,</HI> as they were called, of the Mother Club, and who mu&s;t ever be looked upon (under Genet) as the chief in&s;tru|ments in founding the &s;ect, were:

<P>The&s;e names &s;hould never be forgotten.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The effects of the in&s;titution &s;oon became apparent from one end of the United States to the other. The blaze did not, indeed, communicate it&s;elf with &s;uch rapidity as it had done in France, nor did it rage with &s;o much fury when it had caught; but this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the nature of the materials, and not to any want of art or malice on the part of the incen|diaries. The Americans are phlegmatic, &s;low to act; extremely cautious and difficult to be deceived. How|ever, &s;uch was the indefatigablene&s;s of the Democra|tic Clubs, that I venture to &s;ay, without running the ri&s;k of contradiction, that more enmity to the Gene|ral Government was excited in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, by the barefaced corre&s;pondencies and re&s;olves of the&s;e clubs, than was excited again&s;t the colonial govern|ment at the time of the declaration of Independence.</P>
<P>The leading object was to &s;timulate the people to a clo&s;e imitation of the French Revolutioni&s;ts, who had ju&s;t then begun the career of pure unadulterated &s;ans|culotti&s;m. Every act or expre&s;&s;ion that bore the marks of politene&s;s or gentility &s;oon began to be look|ed
<PB N="24" REF="030209_0021_0FF12C3A2F300460">
upon, to u&s;e their own words, as a &s;ort of <HI>leze republicani&s;m.</HI> All the new fangled terms of the re|generated French were introduced and made u&s;e of. The word <HI>citizen,</HI> that &s;talking hor&s;e of modern li|berty-men, became almo&s;t as common in America as in France. People, even people of &s;en&s;e, began to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to be-citizen each other in as &s;hameful a manner as the red-headed ruffians of the Fauxbourg St. Antoine.</P>
<P>The news-printers were in &s;ome &s;ort the teachers of this new cant; and it was diverting enough &s;ome|times to ob&s;erve their embarra&s;&s;ment in rendering the French political jargon into Engli&s;h. One of them having a wedding to announce, found him&s;elf at a &s;tand when he came to the word <HI>citoyenne.</HI> Our good ance&s;tors had not fore&s;een the&s;e days of equality, and had therefore never thought of a termination to ex|pre&s;s the <HI>feminine</HI> of a <HI>free-man.</HI> To &s;ay that <HI>citizen</HI> A. was married to <HI>citizen</HI> B. would have had a brutal &s;ound, even in the ears of a Jacobin, and therefore the ingenious news-man invented a termination, and his paragraph ran thus: <Q>On &mdash; <HI>Citizen</HI> &mdash; was married to <HI>Cite&s;s</HI> &mdash; by <HI>Citizen</HI> &mdash;.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This article is to be found in the <HI>Federal Gazette,</HI> for the year 1793.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>citizens</HI> of France had ju&s;t given &s;ignal proof of their patriotic valour, in making war upon the old bu&s;ts and &s;tatues of their kings and nobles, and tho&s;e of America were determined not to be behind hand with them, as far as lay in their power. Lord Chat|ham's &s;tatue, erected by the people of Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, as a mark of their e&s;teem for the part he took in pleading the cau&s;e of America, was drawn up into the air, by means of a jack and pullies, and ab&s;olutely hanged, not till it was dead, but till the head &s;eparated from the body. The &s;tatue of Lord Bettertout, a piece of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, which &s;tood in the town hou&s;e of William&s;burgh in Virginia, was <HI>beheaded</HI> by the &s;tudents of that place,
<PB N="25" REF="030209_0022_0FF12C7D319880B0">
and every mark of indignity, &s;uch as ignoble minds can &s;how, was heaped on the re&s;emblance of a man, to whom the fathers of the&s;e &s;tudents had yielded all po&s;&s;ible te&s;timony of love and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The rage for <HI>re-bapti&s;m,</HI> as the French call it, al&s;o &s;pread very far. An alley at Bo&s;ton, called <HI>Royal Ex|change Alley,</HI> and the &s;tump of a tree, in the &s;ame town, which had borne the name of <HI>Royal,</HI> were re|baptized with a va&s;t deal of formality: the former was called <HI>Equality Lane,</HI> and the latter <HI>Liberty Stump.</HI> At New York the names of &s;everal &s;treets and places were changed; <HI>Queen Street</HI> became <HI>Pearl Street,</HI> and <HI>King Street, Liberty Street.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were unacquainted with the influence of the Democratic Clubs, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e marks of political in&s;anity. Indeed, the follies of the French &s;eemed to be wafted over the in&s;tant they had birth, and the different di&s;tricts &s;eemed to vie with each other in adopting them. The delirium &s;eized even the women and children; the former began to talk about liberty and equality in a good ma&s;culine &s;tyle: I have heard more than one young woman, un|der the age of twenty, declare that they would wil|lingly have dipped their hands in the blood of the Queen of France. A third part of the children, at lea&s;t, were decorated, like their wi&s;e &s;ires, in trico|lored cockades. <HI>"Dan&s;ons la Carmagnole,"</HI> pro|nounced in a broken accent, was echoed through every &s;treet and every alley of Philadelphia, by both boys and girls. Some ingenious democratic poet had com|po&s;ed the following lines:
<Q><L>"Engli&s;hman no bon for me,</L>
<L>"Frenchman fight for liberty."</L></Q></P>
<P>This di&s;tich, which at once &s;hows the prevailing &s;en|timents, and exhibits an in&s;tance of that kind of jar|gon which was become fa&s;hionable, was chanted about by young and old. Poor devils! thought I when I u&s;ed to hear them, little do you know about liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030209_0023_0FF12C7FB0F50CF0">Nor were marks of ferocity wanting. At a dinner at Philadelphia (at which <HI>a man high in office</HI> was pre|&s;ent) a <HI>roa&s;ted pig</HI> became the repre&s;entative of Louis XVI. and it being the anniver&s;ary of his murder, the pig's head was &s;evered from his body, then carried round to each of the convives, who, after placing the liberty-cap upon his own head, pronounced the word <HI>tyrant,</HI> and gave the poor little grunter's head a chop with his knife.</P>
<P>Never was the memory of any man &s;o cruelly in|&s;ulted as that of this mild and humane monarch. He was guillotined in effigy, in the capital of the union, twenty or thirty times every day, during one whole winter, and part of the &s;ummer. Men, women, and children, flocked to this tragical exhibition, and not a &s;ingle paragraph appeared in the papers to &s;hame them from it.&mdash;Much has been &s;aid about the <HI>cruelty of En|gli&s;h &s;ports,</HI> and the <HI>humane</HI> French have now-and-then &s;tigmatized them as barbarians, for the delight they take in &s;eeing a pair of courageous animals &s;pur each other to death; nay, the charge has been often repeated by Americans, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that no|thing can be &s;aid in its defence; but I defy both French and Americans to bring me an in&s;tance of cru|elty from the Engli&s;h &s;ports, that will bear a compari|&s;on with the exhibition above mentioned.</P>
<P>One cannot think of this exhibition without reflect|ing on the honours that Louis formerly received on the &s;ame &s;pot. On the triumphal arch that was erect|ed at Philadelphia, in 1783, was a bu&s;t of Louis XVI, with this motto:
<Q><L><HI>MERENDO MEMORES FACIT.</HI></L>
<L>His Merit makes us remember him.</L></Q></P>
<P>On another part of the arch were the <HI>Three Lillies,</HI> the arms of France, with this motto:
<Q><L><HI>GLORIAM SUPERANT.</HI></L>
<L>They exceed in Glory.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="030209_0024_0FF12C8254701DE0">When a repre&s;entation of this Triumphal Arch was &s;ent to the King of France, what would he have done to one of his courtiers, who &s;hould have &s;aid to him: <Q>Sire, be not too vain; depend not too much on the &s;incerity of the Americans; for, ten years from this day, they will &s;hake hands with your mur|derers, and on the very &s;pot where this arch was erected, they will murder you in effigy; and the&s;e Lillies, now &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in glory, will they trample under foot.</Q></P>
<P>It is ju&s;t, however, to ob&s;erve, that a very great majority of the people of America, abhorred the&s;e de|mon&s;trations of a &s;anguinary &s;pirit; nor would it be going too far to a&s;&s;ert, that two-thirds of the Demo|crats were foreigners, landed in the United States &s;ince the war. The charge that attaches to the peo|ple in general, is, that the&s;e things were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unreproved. The friends of order and of huma|nity were dilatory; like per&s;ons of the &s;ame de&s;crip|tion in France, they &s;eemed to be waiting, till the &s;ons of equality came to cut their throats; and if they have finally e&s;caped, it is to be a&s;cribed to mere chance, or to any thing, rather than to their own exertions.</P>
<P>While the Democratic Societies were thus poi&s;oning the minds of the people, familiarizing them to in&s;ur|rection and blood, Genet was not idle. He had &s;ur|rounded him&s;elf with a troop of hor&s;e, enli&s;ted and embodied in Philadelphia. The&s;e were, in general, Frenchmen, and no one can doubt but they were in|tended to act, either on the offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, as occa&s;ion might require. This force rendered his ad|herents bold; they threw off all re&s;erve, and i&s;&s;ued their invitations to rebellion with an un&s;paring hand. The clubs at a di&s;tance followed the example, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, improved upon it.</P>
<P>As the Democrats increa&s;ed in &s;trength and impu|dence, other men grew timid. No one ventured to whi&s;per his di&s;approbation of the conduct of the
<PB N="28" REF="030209_0025_0FF12C84D6CCD678">
French; every one, even of their mo&s;t &s;avage acts, was applauded: robbery and murder were called <HI>na|tional ju&s;tice</HI> in America as well as in France. The people, properly &s;o called, were fairly cowed down, and things &s;eemed as ripe for a revolution here, as they were in France, in the month of July, 1790.</P>
<P>The country was &s;aved from this dreadful &s;courge by the ha&s;ty indi&s;cretion of the Citizen Mini&s;ter. The light-headed Frenchman was intoxicated with his &s;uc|ce&s;s, and conceived that the moment was arrived for him to &s;et the government at defiance, and call on the people for &s;upport. But no &s;ooner had he expre&s;&s;ed his intention of <Q>appealing from the Pre&s;ident to the &s;overeign people,</Q> than he found he had been too &s;anguine. He found that the <HI>people of America</HI> were yet more attached to General Wa&s;hington than to the French Mini&s;ter or the French nation. Their love and veneration for their old and tried friend &s;eemed to be revived by this in&s;ult; and though the Democratic Clubs defended the conduct of their founder, they found them&s;elves too weak to take any decided &s;tep in his favour.</P>
<P>When Genet di&s;covered that he had been too ra&s;h, he &s;trove to recover him&s;elf by denying that he had threatened the government with an appeal to the peo|ple, and his friend <HI>Dallas,</HI> who, as Secretary of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, had been the bearer of the threat, was prevailed on to deny that it was made. <HI>Dallas</HI> publi&s;hed an explanation of his contradictory account of the matter, endeavouring to exculpate both the Frenchman and him&s;elf; but this explanation had no other effect than that which a lie added to an offence never fails to produce.</P>
<P>From this time forward the clubs were a little more cautious in their re&s;olves. When they met it was by night, and <HI>under lock and key.</HI> Genet became timid, attempted to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and &s;eemed to tremble for his fate. He &s;aw that his re&s;ources decrea&s;ed, and
<PB N="29" REF="030209_0026_0FF12C888EAA68E8">
that the remainder would be wanted for other pur|po&s;es than that of nouri&s;hing a ne&s;t of hungry Demo|crats. The vital principle being extinct, the body be|gan to dwindle: the old leaders &s;kulked off one by one, and at la&s;t none remained but the mere tools.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e were the Democrats from England, a &s;et of mortals who&s;e &s;tupidity is equalled by their ob|&s;tinacy, and by that alone. They, poor devils, who had never been &s;uffered even to &s;mell the loaves and fi&s;hes, per&s;evered with as good heart as ever, after the fea&s;t was all over; and wondered why others abated in their zeal. Engli&s;hmen are &s;aid to be changeable and fickle minded; but when foreigners lay this to our charge, they &s;hould make an exception of one ca&s;e, and that is, <HI>when we are in the wrong.</HI> No men on earth abandon their errors with &s;o much reluctance as the inhabitants on the &s;outh of the Tweed.</P>
<P>One <HI>Pearce,</HI> who had had the honour to be a dele|gate to the <HI>London Corre&s;ponding Society,</HI> and who, on that account, was admitted a member of the Jacobin club of Philadelphia, propo&s;ed a <HI>negro man</HI> as worthy of a &s;eat. Pearce was a philanthropi&s;t, a true equa|lity man, a di&s;ciple of Winche&s;ter. He was &s;illy enough to &s;uppo&s;e that the Democrats were really what they profe&s;&s;ed to be, and therefore he fore&s;aw no kind of oppo&s;ition to the introduction of his char|coal-faced friend, and having an extraordinary degree of zeal for the increa&s;e of the &s;ociety, took the earlie&s;t opportunity to propo&s;e him. The club being met and the doors locked, he ro&s;e in all the pride of con&s;cious &s;ans-culotti&s;m, and propo&s;ed brother Pompey as a member; but he &s;oon found that the American Demo|crats did not carry their ideas of equality quite &s;o far as he did. "No, no, no," re&s;ounded from every quarter, and when the votes came to be taken, there appeared but two or three, out of about fifty, in fa|vour of the admi&s;&s;ion; and thus Pompey, whom Pearce de&s;cribes as a d&mdash;d hone&s;t fellow, e&s;caped inevitable corruption and di&s;grace.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030209_0027_0FF12C8CA9ED5660">This refu&s;al, however, lo&s;t them the Delegate: he told them, that he had joined the club in the per&s;ua|&s;ion that it was compo&s;ed of pure Democrats, and that his con&s;cience would not permit him to remain among them a moment, after what he had been a witne&s;s of that night.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the clubs was reduced to trifling di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of this &s;ort, when the recall of Genet &s;eem|ed to forebode their total extinction. Genet's in&s;o|lence had produced a complaint on the part of the American Government, and this complaint had pro|duced his recal. The corner &s;tone of the Jacobin af|filiation being removed, every one expected the &s;u|per&s;tructure to fall to the ground; how deceitful ap|pearances were we &s;hall &s;ee by-and-by, after having made a remark or two on this act of <Q>friendly con|de&s;cen&s;ion,</Q> as it has been termed, of the French u&s;urpers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be remembered, that at the time the complaint was made, the faction, by whom Genet had been &s;ent out, were hurled from their thrones, and ano|ther had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Robe&s;pierre and Ma|rat were glad of having an opportunity to accu&s;e their rivals of having offended the American Government, and to take to them&s;elves the credit of healing the wound. Di&s;placing Genet in&s;tantly, upon application, was a &s;tep, too, which they knew would render them popular in America, and &s;ilence tho&s;e who began to arraign the conduct of the Convention. Thus, by the means of this "conde&s;cen&s;ion," they &s;ecured to them|&s;elves three advantages: it furni&s;hed them with one more crime to heap on the heads of their rival faction; they completely &s;upplanted that faction in the partiality of the people of the United States; and, which was of &s;till greater importance, they pur&s;ued the &s;ame treacherous manoeuvres, without being &s;u&s;pected. The&s;e were the motives of this act of <Q>friendly con|de&s;cen&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="030209_0028_0FF12C9080B050B8">That they did not, in their hearts, di&s;approve of the proceedings of Genet, is clear from their &s;uffering him to remain in the United States. When did they forgive tho&s;e who offended them? Had they demanded him, the government mu&s;t, and, they knew, would, have given him up; but no &s;uch demand was ever made, and this circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficiently proves, that, had he &s;ucceeded, a <HI>civic crown</HI> would have been the mede of his machinations.</P>
<P><HI>Fauchet,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Genet, trod exactly in his &s;teps, but with a little more caution. The Democra|tic Clubs made not the lea&s;t he&s;itation in transferring their obedience from one mini&s;ter to the other. In|deed, all the di&s;ciples of the new-light philo&s;ophy are made of the &s;ame commodious kind of &s;tuff. All that they do is, to a&s;k who directs the &s;torm of anarchy, and they in&s;tantly become his ardent admirers, if not his tools. In this re&s;pect no &s;et of beings, I cannot call them men, ever approached &s;o near to the herd of Paris, as did the Democrats of America. One day &s;aw the faction of Bri&s;&s;ot exalted to the &s;kies, and the very next, &s;aw the &s;ame compliments, the very &s;ame turgid effu&s;ions of patriotic admiration, heaped on their murderers.

I have now a bundle of gazettes before me, publi&s;hed all by the &s;ame man, wherein Mirabeau, Fayette, Bri&s;&s;ot, Danton, and Robe&s;pierre, are all panegyrized and execrated in due &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; nor do I yet de&s;pair of living to &s;ee Talien and Louvet added to the li&s;t. The ver&s;atile mob of Paris, who fir&s;t canonized Mirabeau and Voltaire, and afterwards &s;cattered their remains to the winds; and who, after having given Marat's ugly carca&s;s a place in their temple of fame, and his name to a city, dug him up, put his a&s;hes into a chamber-pot, by way of urn, and then threw them into the common &s;ewer; this ver&s;atile, &s;tupid and venal mob, does not &s;urpa&s;s in either quality, the Democratic news-printers in the

<P>A circum&s;tance that &s;trongly &s;econded the endea|vours of <HI>Fauchet</HI> and the Clubs, was, the di&s;contents that exi&s;ted among the people of the We&s;tern Coun|ties of Penn&s;ylvania, on account of the exci&s;e on whi&s;ky. The&s;e di&s;contents were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, done away, or, at lea&s;t, they produced no &s;erious con&s;equences, before the in&s;titution of the Democra|tic Societies: with this in&s;titution they revived, and a&s;&s;umed a more determined a&s;pect: the malcontents
<PB N="33" REF="030209_0030_0FF12C968C2004E8">
had now a rallying point; by means of the affiliation they communicated their pretended grievances to every corner of the Union, from whence they in&s;tantly re|ceived a&s;&s;urances of aid and &s;upport of the clubs. Thus encouraged, they proceeded from one exce&s;s to another, till, at la&s;t, &s;everal counties were officially declared to be in a &s;tate of actual in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>To give a detailed account of this in&s;urrection, were it con&s;i&s;tent with my circum&s;cribed plan, would be of little u&s;e. That <HI>fifteen thou&s;and</HI> men were obliged to quit their homes and bu&s;ine&s;s, to encounter a campaign of uncommon hard&s;hip and toil; that many of the&s;e peaceable, orderly citizens (citizens in the true &s;en&s;e of the word) lo&s;t their lives in con&s;equence of the fatigues they underwent, leaving their a&s;hes to be trod on by the vile in&s;urgents; that the expen&s;es of the armament to a million and a half of dollars, are to be deducted from the fruits of indu&s;try; the&s;e are well known, and will be long remembered facts, and therefore need no hi&s;torian. It is to the influence that the Democratic Clubs had in producing the in&s;urrec|tion, and its con&s;equent calamities, that I wi&s;h to di|rect the reader's attention.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Club at Philadelphia was formed, &s;imilar ones were formed in the We&s;tern Counties, compo&s;ed entirely of men, who were not only oppo&s;ed to the exci&s;e law, but to the government which had enacted it. Me&s;&s;engers and emi&s;&s;aries pa&s;&s;ed continu|ally between the clubs in the Ea&s;t and tho&s;e in the We&s;t. From this time the <HI>re&s;olves</HI> of the malcontents a&s;&s;umed another tone. The&s;e refractory people had hitherto confined their demands to a repeal of the exci&s;e law; but they now talked of forcing the go|vernment to open the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and complained, in the &s;tyle of Genet and the Clubs, again&s;t the Proclamation of Neutrality, and, in &s;hort, again&s;t the whole of the conduct of the Federal Go|vernment.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="030209_0031_0FF12C9959CEEF00">Let any one read their <HI>toa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>re&s;olves,</HI> and ob|&s;erve their manner of proceeding, and compare the&s;e with tho&s;e of the Democratic Societies; and then be|lieve, if he can, that they were not both actuated with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and had not the &s;ame objects in view; namely, a war with Britain, and the de&s;truction of the General Government. During two years had the We&s;tern complaints exi&s;ted: the complainants had often a&s;&s;embled, and had pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olves without number about their dete&s;table drink; but never till now did they join their cau&s;e to that of France: ne|ver till now did they wear national cockades, or rally under the <HI>tree of liberty</HI> mounted with a bloody Pa|ri&s;ian cap.

<P>Let us hear our old friend <HI>Citizen Fauchet's</HI> opinion on this &s;ubject. In giving his ma&s;ters an account of the breaking out of the in&s;urrection, he &s;ays: <Q>In the mean time <HI>popular &s;ocieties are formed;</HI> politi|cal ideas concentre them&s;elves; the <HI>patriotic party unite</HI> and more clo&s;ely connect them&s;elves, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash; Then, after giving them a de&s;cription of the We&s;tern people and the nature of their drink, &amp;c. he adds: <Q>Now, as the common di&s;patches inform you, the&s;e complaints <HI>were &s;y&s;tematizing</HI> by the <HI>conver&s;ations of influential men, who retired into the&s;e wild coun|tries,</HI> and who, from <HI>principle,</HI> or by a &s;eries of <HI>particular heart-burnings, animated di&s;contents</HI> alrea|dy near efferve&s;cence. At la&s;t, the <HI>local explo&s;ion is effected.</HI> The We&s;tern people calculated on be|ing &s;upported by <HI>&s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the Ea&s;t,</HI> and even imagined they had in the bo&s;om of the government &s;ome abettors, who might &s;hare in their grievances or their principles.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to point out the&s;e <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the Ea&s;t;</HI> but let the reader recollect that <HI>Mr. Dallas</HI> was one in the leaders of the Mother,
<PB N="35" REF="030209_0032_0FF12C9DAAD07AD0">
and then let him read the following extract from ano|ther part of <HI>Fauchet's Letter.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Of all the governors, who&s;e duty it was to ap|pear at the head of the requi&s;itions, <HI>the governor of Penn&s;ylvania</HI> alone enjoyed <HI>the name of Republi|can;</HI> his opinion of the Secretary of the Trea&s;u|ry and of his &s;y&s;tems was known to be unfavourable. The <HI>&s;ecretary of this &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great influence in the Popular Society of Philadelphia,</HI> which in its turn influenced tho&s;e of other &s;tates; of cour&s;e he merited attention. It appears therefore that the&s;e men, with others unknown to me, all having without doubt Randolph at their head, were ba|lancing to decide on their party. Two or three days before the proclamation was publi&s;hed, and of cour&s;e before the cabinet had re&s;olved on its mea|&s;ures, Mr. Randolph came to &s;ee me with an air of great eagerne&s;s, and made to me the overtures, of which I have given you an account in my No. 6. Thus, with &s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars, the Repub|lic could have decided on civil war or on peace! Thus the con&s;ciences of the pretended patriots of America have already their prices! It is very true that the certainty of the&s;e conclu&s;ions, painful to be drawn, will for ever exi&s;t in our archives! What will be the old age of this government, if it is thus early decrepid!</Q></P>
<P>From the conduct of the democrats prior to the breaking out of the in&s;urrection, we naturally come to that which they ob&s;erved &s;ub&s;equent to that event; and here we &s;hall find nothing but what tends to &s;trengthen the charge again&s;t them. Immediately upon the i&s;&s;uing of the Pre&s;ident's proclamation, all the pa|pers devoted to the French Mini&s;ter and his clubs, and particularly <HI>Bache's,</HI> which might be looked upon as the mirror of their &s;entiments, attacked, with all their malice, both tho&s;e who i&s;&s;ued, and tho&s;e who were ready to obey it. Every art was u&s;ed to in&s;til into the minds of the militia, that they were called on to cut the
<PB N="36" REF="030209_0033_0FF12CA03581A5A8">
throats of their fellow citizens merely to &s;upport the rich creditors of the State; and, of cour&s;e, that they ought not to obey the &s;ummons to attend. <Q>As vio|lent means,</Q> (&s;ays Bache's paper of the 20th of Augu&s;t) <Q>As <HI>violent means</HI> appear the de&s;ire of high-toned government men, it is to be hoped that tho&s;e who derive the mo&s;t benefit from our revenue laws, will be the foremo&s;t to march again&s;t the We&s;tern In&s;urgents. Let &s;tock-holders, bank directors, &s;pe|culators, and revenue officers arrange them&s;elves immediately <HI>under the banners of the trea&s;ury,</HI> and try their prowe&s;s in arms, as they have done in cal|culation. The prompt recour&s;e to ho&s;tilities will no doubt operate upon the <HI>knights</HI> of our country to appear in military array, and then the <HI>poor but in|du&s;trious citizen</HI> will not be <HI>obliged to &s;pill the blood of his fellow citizen to gratify certain re&s;entments,</HI> and expo&s;e him&s;elf to the lo&s;s of life and of limb to <HI>&s;upport a funding order.</HI></Q> In the &s;ame paper of the 26th of Augu&s;t: <Q>The di&s;contents which have taken place in the We&s;tern Counties, and which have ap|peared in the form of open ho&s;tility to law, and in|deed the di&s;&s;atisfactions that are to be found in every part of the continent, may be readily accounted for, by a reference to the proceedings of our govern|ment <HI>from its birth.</HI> The bantling fancied it&s;elf <HI>&s;omething royal,</HI> before it was able to &s;tand alone, and &s;ince it has been progre&s;&s;ing towards manhood, the State dignity, &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s and manners of a monarch have characterized its actions. To &s;upport it&s;elf in royal pomp, aro&s;e the funding and banking &s;y&s;tems, <HI>exci&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. Nothing but coronets and &s;tars are wanting, to the &s;tockholders. Is this a land of liberty? Is this a land where citizens are <HI>equal? It would be no wonder</HI> if every citizen, who is not immediately intere&s;ted in the funding &s;y&s;tem, <HI>&s;hould ri&s;e up,</HI> and with one word <HI>exclaim again&s;t its iniquity,</HI></Q> or, in other words, <HI>join the in&s;urgents.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the language of the democrats, at the very moment that the in&s;urrection wore the mo&s;t threaten|ing
<PB N="37" REF="030209_0034_0FF12CA26C6A8B60">
a&s;pect, and &s;uch was the effect it had on &s;ome de|&s;criptions of the people, that it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty a &s;ufficient number of men were collected to make up the quota of the State of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Mr. Findley, the ingenious hi&s;torian of the We&s;tern In&s;urrection, and a principal actor in it, in&s;i&s;ts, with a <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> becoming his country, that the in&s;urrection ought to be attributed entirely to the irritable <HI>heat of the weather,</HI> during the dog-days of 1794; and, of cour&s;e he wi&s;hes us to believe, that it was quelled by the returning coolne&s;s of October and November. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the in&s;urgents were afflicted with a &s;ort of canine malady, for they &s;napped at the hand that yielded them protection; but, I believe, few peo|ple, after what has been &s;aid above, will not remain well convinced, that the in&s;urrection was fomented by democratic fuel, paid for with French Gold; and that it was cooled again by the approach of General Wa&s;h|ington, at the head of fifteen thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of pre&s;erving connection, &s;ome &s;triking traits of &s;ans-culotti&s;m, which took place prior to the epoch at which we are now arrived, have been omitted; but they are too characteri&s;tic of the &s;ect who&s;e hi&s;tory I am writing, to pa&s;s altogether unnoticed.</P>
<P>As I have more than once ob&s;erved, that the Demo|crats aped the regenerated French in all their follies, and in all their crimes as far as they were able, it will be under&s;tood, that they made a boa&s;t of being athei&s;ts or dei&s;ts as the Convention changed its creed. When the faction of Danton &s;eemed to preponderate, and members exclaimed again&s;t the "ari&s;tocracy of heaven;" when the infamous <HI>Dupont</HI> exclaimed: <Q>Oh! &s;hame, Legi&s;|lators of the Univer&s;e! You have hurled down the thrones of kings, and you yet &s;uffer the altars of God to remain!</Q> Then the Democrats made an open profe&s;&s;ion of Athei&s;m. But when <HI>Robe&s;pierre</HI> obtain|ed the a&s;cendency, and ordered the Convention <HI>to decree,</HI> that there was a <HI>Supreme Being</HI> (Etre Supreme); then
<PB N="38" REF="030209_0035_0FF12CA6E09DF9C0">
did our good &s;ans-culottes burn incen&s;e on the altars of dei&s;m, with as much devotion as the ragged groups of <HI>St. Marceau</HI> and the whores and bullies of the <HI>Palais de L'Egalite.</HI></P>
<P>It has been often ob&s;erved, that, however widely athei&s;m and dei&s;m may differ in theory, in practice, that is in their effects, they are nearly the &s;ame. So it hap|pens now; for, whether they profe&s;&s;ed the opinions of Danton or tho&s;e of his bloody &s;ucce&s;&s;or, they &s;till te&s;tifi|ed the &s;ame hatred of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and per&s;e|cuted, with every in&s;ult they dur&s;t offer, all tho&s;e who had courage enough to &s;tand forward in its defence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault of this kind was on the Reverend Mr. Abercrombie of the Epi&s;copal Church, Philadel|phia. This gentleman had preached a &s;ermon, warn|ing his congregation again&s;t the contagion of French athei&s;m and dei&s;m. For this in&s;tance of becoming zeal in the di&s;charge of the mo&s;t imperious of all duties, he was attacked in the public papers; accu&s;ed of <HI>bigotry,</HI> of being <HI>an enemy to the cau&s;e of liberty,</HI> and of the <HI>French people.</HI> There was not a worthy man in the city, who did not feel an indignation again&s;t the authors of this unprovoked calumny, and who did not regret, that the injured clergyman &s;hould &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of an&s;wering it. Dreadful times indeed are tho&s;e, when the &s;ervants of the Lord are brought to the bar of the public, for daring to obey the commands of their ma&s;ter! For daring to defend him again&s;t tho&s;e, who brand him with the name of cheat and impo&s;tor! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About the &s;ame time that this in&s;ult was offered to Mr. Aber|crombie, a paragraph appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette, pub|li&s;hed by one Brown, containing a li&s;t of eminent men, who had ari&s;en on "the democratic floor," and concluding with, <HI>Marat, St. Paul,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I have mentioned this &s;candalous paragraph in &s;o many places, that I &s;hould not have done it here, had not its exi&s;tence been de|nied in a pamphlet lately publi&s;hed by a Scotch run-away, who&s;e name is <HI>Calender,</HI> and who was, it &s;eems, the editor of the gazette at the time. The paragraph appeared in the paper above-mentioned, on the 20th of June, in the memorable 1794.</P></NOTE></P>

It has nothing to do with the wor&s;hip of the mo&s;t high God, nor the government under which we exi&s;t: it has a ten|dency to cau&s;e that church to be di&s;liked, while <HI>bearing the mark of infamy:</HI> it has a tendency, to the knowledge of many, to keep <HI>young</HI> and <HI>virtuous men</HI> from attending public wor&s;hip: it is therefore a public nui&s;ance.</P>

<P>One is at a lo&s;s which to admire mo&s;t, the logic, the impudence, or the hypocri&s;y of this intimation. How exactly, too, does it imitate the &s;tyle of the Con|vention;
<PB N="40" REF="030209_0037_0FF161D1105653C8">
"<HI>young</HI> and <HI>virtuous men!</HI>" Canting ra&s;cals! How willingly would you have led tho&s;e <HI>young</HI> and <HI>virtuous men</HI> to cut the throats of their fathers and mothers, and of the mini&s;ters to whom they were at|tached!</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the democratic <HI>card,</HI> which was rightly looked upon as a threat, a ve&s;try was called, and it was thought more advi&s;eable to abandon the bu&s;t to the fury of the <HI>vandals,</HI> than to expo&s;e the church it&s;elf to danger. Accordingly, the <HI>barbarians</HI> a&s;&s;em|bled with ladders, mallets and chi&s;&s;els. The crown and the projecting part of the bu&s;t were chipped off; but the profile, with G on one &s;ide of it and II. on the other, are &s;till as con&s;picuous as ever. All that the Democrats effected, was, a change in the ideas awakened by the &s;ight of the bu&s;t. From a monument of well-placed e&s;teem and gratitude, it is become a monument of democratic folly and ba&s;ene&s;s and ran|cour and undi&s;tingui&s;hing revenge.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive, that they did not mean to &s;top here, and therefore few people were &s;urpri&s;ed at their next pointing out the propriety of taking the <HI>mitre</HI> from the &s;teeple.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bache's gazette of the 21&s;t Augu&s;t, 1794.</NOTE> This demand was not made in &s;uch direct and po&s;itive terms, and therefore it was not complied with; but there is little doubt but both mitre and church would have had a tumble long ago, had not the We&s;tern In&s;urrection excited a general hatred again&s;t the clubs, and thus rendered them le&s;s daring and in&s;olent.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that we are recording the violences of the clubs again&s;t Chri&s;tian in&s;titutions, truth re|quires that we &s;hould confe&s;s, that but too many of the clergy appeared either contaminated with French principles, or cowardly enough not to attempt an op|po&s;ition to their progre&s;s. All that can be &s;aid in the defence of &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, is, that they feared to offend
<PB N="41" REF="030209_0038_0FF161D3D18A9DA8">
their congregations, on whom they were totally de|pendent for &s;upport. This is &s;urely a very weak de|fence; but, I am afraid, it is one that mu&s;t often be made, where the pa&s;tor is removable at the plea&s;ure of his flock.</P>
<P>But, there were others who were not merely pa&s;|&s;ive; who were not a&s;hamed to mingle in the baccha|nalian orgies of the civic fe&s;tivals, held to celebrate the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of athei&s;ts over the religion of which they profe&s;&s;ed to be believers, and of which they were teachers. Among the&s;e the <HI>Reverend Citizen Prenti&s;s,</HI> of Reading, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and the <HI>Reverend Citizen Doctor M'Knight,</HI> of New York, claim the &s;candalous pre-eminence.</P>
<P>Nor were the places dedicated to the in&s;truction of youth &s;ecurely guarded again&s;t the approaches of &s;ans-culotti&s;m. Of this the conduct of Doctor Rogers, a teacher in the Univer&s;ity at Philadelphia, exhibits a &s;triking proof. He gave the boys of his cla&s;s a &s;peech out of Shake&s;peare's Harry V. to get by heart. It was the king's animating addre&s;s to his army before Harfleur: "Once more to the breach, dear friends," &amp;c. which, in Shake&s;peare ends thus:
<Q><L>"Follow your &s;pirit, and, upon this charge,</L>
<L>"Cry&mdash;God for Harry! England! and St. George!"</L></Q></P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion the Doctor parodied:
<Q>"Cry&mdash;God for <HI>Freedom! France!</HI> and <HI>Robe&s;pierre!"</HI></Q></P>
<P>All the cla&s;s repeated it with the democratic emen|dation, except a little Engli&s;h boy about ten or eleven years of age, who boldly &s;aid:
<Q>"Cry&mdash;God for <HI>Harry! England!</HI> and <HI>St. George!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Nor could he be prevailed upon to alter the text. This brave little fellow's name is Whitlock, who,
<PB N="42" REF="030209_0039_0FF161D693E5B060">
though a child, certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more ta&s;te, more &s;en&s;e, more patrioti&s;m and more piety than his Reve|rend teacher.</P>
<P>When the &s;weet Warwick&s;hire bard put this noble &s;peech into the mouth of his favourite hero, he was not ble&s;&s;ed with the hope, that, hundreds of years af|terwards, and thou&s;ands of miles di&s;tant, it would call forth &s;uch a noble &s;pirit in a child of ten years of age.</P>
<P>Before I return to take my leave of the Democratic Societies, I tru&s;t the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with an account of the civic <HI>fete</HI> of the 23d <HI>Thermidor</HI> (10th of Augu&s;t, "&s;tyle of the &s;laves"), which was celebra|ted at Philadelphia in 1794.</P>
<P>To ward off every charge of mi&s;repre&s;entation, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a literal tran&s;lation of the <HI>Proces Verbal</HI> (Minutes of the proceedings), &s;ent to the Con|vention, and which may be &s;een in the French Phi|ladelphia gazette of the 25th <HI>Thermidor,</HI> 12th of Augu&s;t, "&s;tyle of the &s;laves," as the <HI>humane</HI> French Governor of Gaudaloupe calls it.</P>
<Q><P>At &s;un-ri&s;e the <HI>fete</HI> was announced by a <HI>&s;alve</HI> of 22 guns, in allu&s;ion to the 22d of Sept.&mdash;At eight o'clock another <HI>&s;alve</HI> of 10 guns, at once announced the <HI>fete</HI> of the 10th Augu&s;t, and the hour of a&s;|&s;embling.</P>
<P>The French and <HI>American</HI> citizens now repaired to the centre &s;quare, where the order of march was to be &s;ettled on the greate&s;t part of the citi|zens wore oak-boughs, and little bunches of ears of wheat, ornamented with <HI>tricolored</HI> ribbons.</P>
<P>In the middle of the &s;quare there was an obeli&s;k <HI>[made of pa&s;te board],</HI> decorated with attributes of liberty. On the four &s;ides of the obeli&s;k were <HI>engraven</HI> [engraven on pa&s;te-board mind] the fol|lowing in&s;criptions:</P>
<LG>
<PB N="43" REF="030209_0040_0FF161D83248DD20">
<L>"To Immortality.</L>
<L>"The French Republic one and indivi&s;ible.</L>
<L>"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.</L>
<L>"Tremble Tyrants, your reign is over.</L>
</LG>
<P>A deputation of French citizens then went to the French Mini&s;ter's where the <HI>chiefs civil and military of the State of Penn&s;ylvania</HI> were a&s;&s;embled. A deputy announced to the mini&s;ter that the good people were waiting for their <HI>repre&s;entatives.</HI> They immediately came to the &s;quare preceded by the flags of the two nations, marching to the noi&s;e of drums and cannons, and amid&s;t the cries, a hundred times repeated, of <HI>Vive la Republique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e!</HI> [I will not di&s;grace our language by tran&s;lating the vile accla|mation]; and war-like mu&s;ic played, by intervals, airs analogous to the tran&s;ports which bur&s;t forth from every quarter.</P>
<P>When every thing was ready, ten guns were fired as a &s;ignal for the march. Two pieces of cannon, followed by French and American cannoneers, took the lead. The hatred that we were going to &s;wear again&s;t tyrants, was written on every countenance. The anniver&s;ary of the de&s;truction of de&s;poti&s;m painted on every face patrioti&s;m, liberty, and equal|ity.</P>
<P>The <HI>obeli&s;k was carried by four citizens,</HI> two French and two American, in red liberty caps: the&s;e were followed by a French grenadier, bearing a <HI>pike</HI> &s;urmounted with a liberty cap.</P></Q>
<P>Now comes the prettie&s;t part of the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<Q><P>Twelve young <HI>c&icirc;toyennes</HI> (or &s;he citizens), dre&s;&s;ed in pure white, adorned with civic crowns and ce&s;tu|&s;es tricolor, each bearing a little ba&s;ket of flowers, &s;urrounded the obeli&s;k.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="44" REF="030209_0041_0FF161D9E4AA2F48">What a contra&s;t there was between the&s;e little in|nocent lambs, with their flower-ba&s;kets, and the &s;warthy grenadier with his bloody pike and cap!</P>
<Q><P>The French Mini&s;ter, the Con&s;uls, the <HI>chiefs civil and military of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> marched in the centre of the proce&s;&s;ion.</P></Q>
<P>Indeed it was diverting enough to &s;ee the&s;e great per&s;onages, the good &s;ober-looking, pot-bellied chiefs of Penn&s;ylvania, come &s;queezing, and &s;houldering, and zigzaging along, like &s;o many raw recruits at drill. They were formed into what military men call a pla|toon, and never did my eyes behold &s;o awkward a &s;quad.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall omi&s;&s;ion in this part of the <HI>Proces Verbal,</HI> which I &s;hall &s;upply.&mdash;Before the proce&s;&s;ion left the centre &s;quare, the <HI>Engli&s;h flag,</HI> which had been brought thither <HI>rever&s;ed,</HI> under the flags of France and America, was <HI>burnt</HI> before the obeli&s;k, amid&s;t the tri|umphant hootings of the brave &s;ons of liberty and equal|ity.&mdash;This was by way of retaliation for Lord Howe's victory over the &s;ans-culotte fleet, the news of which had arrived the day before.</P>
<Q><P>The proce&s;&s;ion advanced to the garden of the Mini&s;ter Fran&ccedil;ois, where there was an altar erect|ed to the country, on which &s;tood the godde&s;s of liberty. The flags of the two nations were planted on each &s;ide of her, while the little &s;he citizens were ranged round the altar.</P>
<P>Patriotic hymns were now &s;ung, accompanied with mu&s;ic; and while the mo&s;t tender and melting invocations were put up, the &s;he citizens made to the godde&s;s a &s;weet &s;melling offering of the flowers they had brought, with which they covered her altar, with an innocent zeal peculiar to their age.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030209_0042_0FF161E00CA42138">The patriotic hymns being ended, an oration was made by a Citizen Fran&ccedil;ois, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well worthy of remark, that this oration, which was &s;ent to the convention, contained a high &s;trained compliment to <HI>Robe&s;pierre,</HI> ju&s;t at the very time that the convention and their mob were hacking and &s;hooting and guillotining him.&mdash;Had the <HI>virtuous civic feters</HI> known this, they would have cur&s;ed him mo&s;t heartily; as, indeed, they did two months afterwards. &mdash;What a pity it is, that there is no means by which our &s;ans-culottes can come at the exact &s;tate of things in France at the moment they are framing their toa&s;ts and re&s;olves!</NOTE> and then the Mini&s;ter Fran&ccedil;ois made another, and then the whole &s;wore to be faithful to the Republic. The be&s;t of this was, three-fourths of the audience did not under&s;tand a word of what they heard, of what they &s;wore to, or even of the oath they took.</P>
<Q><P>The Mini&s;ter had hardly time to conclude, when the cries [or howlings] of <HI>Vive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Republique Fran|&ccedil;ois une et indivi&s;ible!</HI> bur&s;t forth from every throat.</P>
<P>A di&s;charge of cannon, a war-like march, and a roll of the drums, expre&s;&s;ed the joy of the people, and &s;ignified that every heart was glad.&mdash;In&s;tantly the ranks broke off, and dances were formed round the altar of liberty, and over all the enclo&s;ure.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e dances were the fine&s;t fun I ever enjoyed. The patriotic hymns were well enough; four hundred fellows howling out French bomba&s;t, without under|&s;tanding a word of it, was not a bad &s;pecimen of fra|ternal di&s;&s;onance; but to behold fifty or &s;ixty groupes, promi&s;cou&s;ly formed, whi&s;tling, &s;inging and capering about they knew not why nor wherefore; and to &s;ee the <HI>"chiefs civil and military of Penn&s;ylvania,"</HI> heav|ing up their legs, and endeavouring to ape the light-heeled moun&s;eers, was a &s;pectacle which, I tru&s;t, has been &s;eldom equalled.&mdash;In one part of the garden you heard the chorus of the bloody
<Q><L>Ah! &ccedil;a ira, &ccedil;a ira, &ccedil;a ira,</L>
<L>Les Ari&s;tocrats a la Lanterne.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="030209_0043_0FF161E1AA5E8308">In another:
<Q><L>Dan&s;ons la carmagnole,</L>
<L>Vive le &s;on, vive le &s;on</L>
<L>Du canon.</L></Q></P>
<P>While in another,
<Q>Alons enfans de la patrie</Q>
&s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the lungs of twenty infernals. But what was &s;till mo&s;t ludicrous, was, to hear all this uttered, by the greate&s;t part of the chanters, in an accent barbarous beyond de&s;cription. But, to proceed with my tran&s;lation:</P>
<P><Q>During the re&s;t of the day, public joy was ma|nife&s;ted all over the city.</Q>&mdash;That's a lie. One half of the people of the city cared nothing at all about the <HI>fete,</HI> and were a&s;toni&s;hed and a&s;hamed that the cannons of the &s;tate &s;hould be employed on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; and I venture to affirm, that not one-twen|tieth part of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at it, would have a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, had they known they were celebrating the anni|ver&s;ary of the fall of Louis XVI. and the horrid and cowardly murder of the Swi&s;s guards. This remark ju&s;tice demanded in defence of tho&s;e who attended through ignorance. With regard to the <Q>chiefs, civil and military of Penn&s;ylvania,</Q> as I have too much re&s;pect for them to accu&s;e them of ignorance, I leave them to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now return to the Democratic Clubs. In what remains to be &s;aid of them I &s;hall be very conci&s;e.</P>
<P>Though they were in&s;tituted for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of clogging the wheels of government, weakening its power, and exciting a &s;pirit of di&s;content among the people, that might acquire &s;trength enough to force it into a war on the &s;ide of France, or totally annihi|late it; yet there were three mea&s;ures in this continu|ed oppo&s;ition, again&s;t which the Democrats made a
<PB N="47" REF="030209_0044_0FF161E467DC44F8">
bolder &s;tand than u&s;ual, and called forth more than ordinary exertions; namely, the <HI>Proclamation</HI> of <HI>Neu|trality,</HI> the enforcing obedience to the <HI>Exci&s;e-Law,</HI> and the &s;anctioning of the <HI>Briti&s;h Treaty.</HI> They had entered their &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t the two former, and had u&s;ed every means in their power to effect a forcible, and even an armed oppo&s;ition to them; and their conduct with re&s;pect to the latter was exactly of the &s;ame de&s;cription. But, of every part of this conduct, their re&s;olves again&s;t the appointment of the man be&s;t calculated to bring about an accommodation; their pub|li&s;hing the treaty in a mutilated form with their own in|vidious mi&s;repre&s;entations; their di&s;patching runners to all the principal towns, to exa&s;perate the di&s;contented, and deceive the weak; their di&s;honourable means of obtaining petitions to Congre&s;s again&s;t it; the intrigues of Randolph and Fauchet, and the embarra&s;&s;ment and alarm their machinations &s;pread through the country; all the&s;e are &s;o fre&s;h in every one's memory, that it is u&s;ele&s;s to dwell on them here. Certain it is that they ought not to be forgotten, nor will they be, while <HI>Peter Porcupine's</HI> writings are remembered; and though the&s;e latter are a&s;&s;uredly not de&s;tined to long life, I hope they will outlive the infernal &s;ect of the Jacobins, and if this hope be to be realized, I &s;incerely wi&s;h they may &s;ink into oblivion to-morrow.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern In&s;urrection and its effects had already rendered the Democrats extremely odious; here their mi&s;chievous efforts touched the pockets and the lives of the people; and their failure in the la&s;t attempt to trouble the peace of the Union, obliged them to hide their heads. The dark caballing clubs do, indeed, &s;till exi&s;t; but they either never meet, or they dare not publi&s;h their re&s;olves. However, let not the friends of the General Government, of order, of peace and of general happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, imagine that the &s;ect is annihilated. They only wait for a more favourable moment, and &s;hould the indi&s;cretion or &s;upinene&s;s of the &s;ound part of the community &s;uffer that moment to
<PB N="48" REF="030209_0045_0FF161E60D5ECA60">
arrive, they will obtain an a&s;cendency that will enable them to inflict &s;ignal vengeance for their pa&s;t di&s;ap|pointments. From their reign God defend me and mine!</P>
<P>From one ju&s;tified by his talents in being anxious about his reputation as a writer, the imperfectne&s;s of this &s;ketch would require an apology. As this is not my ca&s;e, I &s;hall make none. However, as publi&s;her of the hi&s;tory of Jacobini&s;m, I hope I can promi&s;e my|&s;elf, that the &s;atisfaction the reader will derive from the book it&s;elf, will induce him to excu&s;e the faults of the Appendix.</P>
