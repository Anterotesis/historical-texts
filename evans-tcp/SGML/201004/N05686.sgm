Now, in fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this Que&s;tion, let it be well con&s;idered, That the wi&s;e End of all Laws, is the Good of the So|ciety for which &s;uch Laws are made.

<P>Now as &s;uch good Con&s;equences would naturally re&s;ult from the above mentioned &s;alutary Law, we leave it to the wi&s;e and thinking Part of Mankind, to &s;ay, what Sort of Men tho&s;e are, who directly oppo&s;e &s;uch a <HI>Benevolent Method</HI> of accomodating Difficulties among&s;t Mankind, &s;o <HI>dependant upon one another in Society.</HI></P>
<P>As the Sun is to the Day after a Tempe&s;t; or Health to the Body after Sickne&s;s; or what a Bridgroom feels coming out of his Chamber, that, LIBERTY is to a broken Trader.</P>
<P>But before we conclude this Head, we beg Leave to an&s;wer a few OBJECTIONS. For &s;ome Men are &s;o &s;ond of Objections, that
<PB N="14" REF="007215_0013_102B3E4DDFF8D080">they di&s;like every Thing but them&s;elves; who indeed are an <HI>Objection</HI> to all Mercy, Peace, and Benevolence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Objection we &s;hall mention is, <Q>That no Man ought to agree to any Thing that is not in his Power to perform, and therefore ought to pay according to his Agreement.</Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this Objection, we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, That in Strictne&s;s of Speech, this is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e no Man has Power over Accidents, Ca&s;ualties, and Contingencies, but is liable to them all, and even this Night his Soul may be required of him, and there|fore whatever <HI>is future,</HI> he has not ab&s;olute Power over, not even of him&s;elf, but is a dependent relative Being, <HI>who&s;e Breath is in his No&s;trils, and who&s;e Life is a Span;</HI> and therefore all Promi&s;es and Agreements are in their Nature uncertain, ca&s;ual, and con|ditional; and when the Power of perform|ing is wanting, the <HI>Intention</HI> is accepted: So that in &s;ome &s;pecial Ca&s;es, a Man may break his Promi&s;e and Contract, and yet be an <HI>hone&s;t Man.</HI></P>
<P>But he that makes a Promi&s;e with a <HI>De|&s;ign</HI> to break it, or with no Re&s;olution of performing it, cannot be &s;o: And he that
<PB N="15" REF="007215_0014_102B3E500511DA00">makes a Promi&s;e, and does not po&s;itively do his Endeavour to the utmo&s;t of his Power to perform it <HI>(if it is ju&s;t)</HI> cannot be an hone&s;t Man; for a Promi&s;e once made, &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>Promi&s;er</HI> willing to be as good as his Word, and it has a binding <HI>Influence</HI> upon him who made the Promi&s;e, &s;o far as his Power of performing extends; but if it is not in his Power to perform it, as in the Affair of Payment of <HI>Money,</HI> is often the Ca&s;e, the Man cannot be condemned as a di&s;hone&s;t Man: For the Performance of <HI>his</HI> Promi&s;e might depend on the Promi&s;es of <HI>Others</HI> to him, on the cu&s;tomary Run of the Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s he is engaged in, and on many other contingent Circum&s;tances, and all might po&s;&s;ibly fail him, tho' ever &s;o ho|ne&s;t a Man him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Objection</HI> therefore, e&s;pecially with Regard to Traders, is unrea&s;onable, and of no Force again&s;t the above mentioned Law.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="007215_0030_102B3E7185FBE7F8">Sin. This &s;peaks for it&s;elf&mdash;And as no Man can approve &s;uch Treatment with Re|gard to him&s;elf, &s;o he ought not to be guilty of it towards others, which fully demon|&s;trates the Inhumanity of Impri&s;oning In|&s;olvent Debtors. And &s;eeing we have no Law to prevent &s;uch barbarous U&s;age, Is it not highly rea&s;onable, wi&s;e, and fit, we &s;hould have &s;uch a Law.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>To deprive an hone&s;t Man of Li|berty, and the Power of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling, is Inhuman and Unrea&s;onable.</HI></P>
<P>Liberty is dear to Man. Life without Liberty, is a Kind of dying daily. Man is born free, and born for Action, and to La|bour, and has a natural Right to Him&s;elf, his Labour, and to the Air, the Earth, and the Seas; and his Fellow Creatures have not, in a State of <HI>Nature,</HI> any Right to in|terrupt him in the free Enjoyment of what his Great Creator has bountifully be&s;towed upon, or granted to him.</P>
<P>But Man in Society, voluntarily gives up Part of his <HI>natural</HI> Liberty, in order to be governed by &s;uch Laws as are be&s;t adapted to promote the Peace and Pro&s;perity of So|ciety&mdash;But then he has an equal Right to
<PB N="32" REF="007215_0031_102B3E73476013A8">as much Liberty as the Laws grant to the other Members in the &s;ame Community. But under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, and un|der the Light of the glorious Go&s;pel, is it right and fit to take away a Man's Liberty, his Labour, yea, his <HI>Liberty</HI> of Air, and &s;hut him up in a Pri&s;on, becau&s;e he has lo&s;t <HI>his Money,</HI> and cannot pay what he oweth; and this by Means out of his Power to pre|vent?</P>
<P>Again: Is it right and &s;it, that Chri&s;tian Communities &s;hould make Laws in <HI>direct Oppo&s;ition</HI> to the Laws of GOD?</P>
<P>By the meer Providence of GOD, an he|ne&s;t Man is &s;uddenly deprived of all his <HI>Worldly Sub&s;tance,</HI> which immediately de|mands our &s;incere Pity and Commi&s;eration and <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</HI> becau&s;e we are under the &s;ame Law of Nature, and therefore certainly liable to the &s;ame Effects and Con&s;equences from the &s;ame <HI>Cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But by a Law in the Community where the unhappy Man &s;uffered under Misfortunes, it is there lawful to ca&s;t him into Pri&s;on for|ever&mdash;for Debt only&mdash;This loo&s;e, <HI>indi&s;cri|minating</HI> Law, is left open, becau&s;e wicked Men, by wicked Deeds, &s;ometimes cheat

Is it not highly rea&s;onable, therefore, to have &s;ome <HI>Medium,</HI> to adju&s;t the Difference be|twixt the <HI>Debtor</HI> and the Creditor?</P>
<P>With what &s;acred Rage! with what Vehemence, Indignation, and <HI>Pathos,</HI> did the Man after GOD's own Heart, call for dire <HI>Vengeance</HI> on &s;uch&mdash;<HI>For they per&s;ecute him, whom thou ha&s;t &s;mitten; and they talk to the Grief of tho&s;e, whom thou ha&s;t wound|ed,</HI> P&s;a. 69.</P>
<P>To <HI>afflict</HI> the <HI>Afflicted,</HI> to take away a Man's <HI>natural</HI> and his <HI>civil</HI> Liberty, and de|prive him of the Power of acting, and im|proving his Time, and his Talents, for the Good of him&s;elf and his Family, for the Benefit of the Community; in doing which, he &s;o far glorifies GOD his Maker, to

<P>Wherefore, <HI>it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the Good of the Community, to have a Law of Equity e&s;tabli&s;hed, which &s;hould judge between the Creditor and the Debtor,</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;es extream.</HI> Becau&s;e the Tempers and Pa&s;&s;ions of Cre|ditors may hurry them on to do &s;uch bar|barous Actions to their Debtors, when unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>their</HI> Power, and under Colour of the Law too, that may ruin a valuable Man, his Family, and deprive Society of a u&s;eful Member; and all out of meer Humour, Will, Re&s;entment, Spite, or Malice. It is <HI>Godlike,</HI> to prevent &s;uch inhuman, &s;uch unrea&s;onable Power.</P>
<P>But Thirdly and La&s;tly. <HI>The Impri&s;oning hone&s;t In&s;olvents, is Inhuman in it&s;elf, and con|&s;equently in de&s;pite of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which is the only Religion we profe&s;s to be|lieve.</HI></P>
<P>Every Thing that is comprehended and implied in the <HI>Words,</HI> Goodne&s;s, Love, Peace, Mercy, Truth, and Charity, is in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Manner recommended and

<Q><P>Then came <HI>Peter</HI> to him, and &s;aid, Lord, how oft &s;hall my Brother &s;in again&s;t me, and I forgive? till &s;even Times?</P>
<P>JESUS &s;aith unto him, I &s;ay not unto thee, until &s;even Times, but until Twenty Times Seven. Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King, which would take an Account of his Ser|vants; and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Talents:</HI> But fora&s;much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be &s;old, and his Wi&s;e and Child|ren, and all that he had, and Payment to be made.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="007215_0035_102B3E7BC85C7508">
The Servant therefore fell down and wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying, Lord, have Pa|tience with me, and I will pay thee All. Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and loo&s;ed him, and <HI>for|gave</HI> him the Debt.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame Servant went out and found one of his Fellow Servant which owed him <HI>an Hundred Pence,</HI> and he laid Hands on him, and took him by the <HI>Throat,</HI> &s;aying, Pay me that thou owe&s;t And his Fellow Servant fell down at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Feet, and be&s;ought him, &s;aying, Have <HI>Patience</HI> with me, and I will pay the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> All; and he would not, but went an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;t him into <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> till he &s;hould pay the Debt.</P>
<P>So when his Fellow Servants &s;aw what was done, they were very &s;orry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done.</P>
<P>Then the Lord, after that he had cal|led him, &s;aid unto <HI>him, O thou wicked Ser|vant,</HI> I forgave thee all <HI>that</HI> Debt, becau&s;e thou de&s;ired&s;t me, &s;hould&s;t not thou al&s;o have had <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> on thy <HI>Fellow Servant</HI> even as I had Pity on thee?</P>
