<P N="3">III. THAT the people of this State have the &s;ole exclu&s;ive and inherent right of governing and re|gulating the internal police of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THAT all power being originally inherent in, and con&s;equently derived from, the people; there|fore all officers of government, whether legi&s;lative or executive, are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="5">V. THAT government is, or ought to be, in&s;ti|tuted for the common benefit, protection and &s;ecu|rity of the people, nation or community; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any &s;ingle man, family or &s;et of men who are a part only of that community: And that the community hath an indubitable, unalienable and indefea&s;ible right to reform, alter or aboli&s;h government in &s;uch man|ner as &s;hall be by that community judged mo&s;t con|ducive to the public weal.</P>

<P N="7">VII. THAT all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a &s;ufficient evident com|mon intere&s;t with, and attachment to the commu|nity, have a right to elect officers, or be elected into office.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. THAT every member of &s;ociety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, li|berty and property, and therefore is bound to con|tribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield his per&s;onal &s;ervice, when nece&s;&s;ary, or an equivalent thereto: But no part of a man's property can be ju&s;tly taken from him, or applied to public u&s;es, without his own con&s;ent, or that of his legal repre&s;entatives: Nor can any man who is con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupulous of bearing arms, be ju&s;tly compelled thereto, if he will pay &s;uch equivalent: Nor are the people bound by any laws, but &s;uch as they have in like manner a&s;&s;ent|ed to, for their common good.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That in all pro&s;ecutions for criminal offen|ces, a man hath a right to be heard by him&s;elf and his Council, to demand the cau&s;e and nature of his

accu&s;ation, to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es, to call for evidence in his favour, and a &s;peedy public trial, by an impartial Jury of the country, without the unanimous con&s;ent of which Jury he cannot be found guilty: Nor can he be compelled to give evi|dence again&s;t him&s;elf: Nor can any man be ju&s;tly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="10">X. THAT the people have a right to hold them|&s;elves, their hou&s;es, papers and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions free from &s;earch or &s;eizure; and therefore warrants with|out oaths or affirmations fir&s;t made, affording a &s;uf|ficient foundation for them, and whereby any of|ficer or me&s;&s;enger may be commanded or required to &s;earch &s;u&s;pected places, or to &s;eize any per&s;on or per&s;ons, his or their property, not particularly de&s;|cribed, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="11">XI. THAT in controver&s;ies re&s;pecting property, and in &s;uits between man and man, the parties have a right to trial by Jury, which ought to be held &s;acred.</P>
<P N="12">XII. THAT the people have a right to freedom of &s;peech, and of writing, and publi&s;hing their &s;en|timents; therefore the freedom of the pre&s;s ought not to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="9" REF="014979_0008_0F973FEE6D72EEF8">XIII.

<P N="16">XVI. THAT a frequent recurrence to fundamen|tal principles, and a firm adherence to ju&s;tice, mo|deration, temperance, indu&s;try and frugality, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the ble&s;&s;ings of li|berty, and keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular attention to the&s;e points in the choice of Officers and Repre&s;entatives, and have a right to exact a due and con&s;tant regard to them, from their Legi&s;lators and Magi&s;trates in the making and executing &s;uch laws as are nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the State.</P>
<P N="15">XV. THAT all men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one State to another that will re|ceive them, or to form a new State in vacant coun|tries, or in &s;uch countries as they can purcha&s;e, whenever they think that thereby they may pro|mote their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THAT the people have a right to a&s;&s;emble together, to con&s;ult for their common good, to in|&s;truct their Repre&s;entatives, and to apply to the Legi&s;lature for redre&s;s of grievances, by addre&s;s, petition or remon&s;trance.</P>
