<HEAD>A LETTER from a GENTLEMAN in one of the Frontier-Counties, to his Friend in Phi|ladelphia, relating to the Paxton-Men.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE PAXTON RIOT (as it is called) makes &s;o great a Noi&s;e, and is &s;o much the general Topick, that a Man mu&s;t be but little in Conver&s;ation, without having his Opi|nion a&s;k'd concerning this Affair.&mdash;In Truth, Matters are now come to &s;uch a Pa&s;s, that &s;ome People are of Opinion, that an Endeavour to make them wor&s;e may probably be the Way to make them better. Re&s;entment rages high, and gathers thick from every Quarter; and where it will &s;top, I mu&s;t leave to tho&s;e that have more <HI>Light within them,</HI> than I can boa&s;t of, to determine.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am no Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt in Politicks, and have but &s;eldom troubled my Head about that Science, beyond the reading of a common News-Paper.&mdash;It has long been my unhappy Lot to be a Spectator of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Suffer|ings of my Fellow Subjects; my Heart has often bled for them;&mdash;and I &s;hould &s;till have continued a &s;ecret Mourner for what I had not Power to redre&s;s, had not the unaccouta|ble Conduct of your City Quakers provoked me to &s;peak my Sentiments, and unburthen my&s;elf to my Friend.&mdash;By my Principles as well as Situation in Life, you know, my dear Sir, that I have no political Ends to &s;erve; that I have no|thing to hope or fear from Party Connections; and that I can have no other View in troubling you with this Let|ter than to re&s;cue the mi&s;erable Frontier People, who lately ro&s;e in Arms, from the Infamy and Odium thrown upon them, by <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who&s;e unfeeling Hearts have never &s;uffered them to look beyond their own private Intere&s;t and Party.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Author of this Letter, hopes he will not be under&s;tood as approving of the&s;e People's having taken up Arms.

Whatever therefore can have a Tendency to promote this; or that offers the <HI>lea&s;t In&s;ult</HI> to the LAWS and GOVERNMENT of his Country, he will ever think it his Duty to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Te&s;timony again&s;t, and to di&s;countenance by every Means in his Power.</NOTE></P>

<P>They could obtain no proper Law to collect their Strength; nor any Sanction or Encouragement to pur&s;ue the Ene|mies of their Country!</P>
<P>That they have &s;uffered and bled in the Cau&s;e of their Country, and have done more to protect it from the Vio|lence of a rapacious Enemy than any others in the Pro|vince.</P>
<P>That agreeable to the Command of the Prophet, they have <Q>fought for their Brethren, their Sons, and their Daughters, their Wives and their Hou&s;es.</Q>&mdash;That in this Conte&s;t, many of them have lo&s;t their deare&s;t Relatives; their Hou&s;es, their Lands, their all; and from a plenti|full independent People have been reduced to Mi&s;ery and Want.</P>
<P>That they have been treated as <HI>Aliens</HI> of the Common-Wealth, and denied a ju&s;t and <HI>proportionable Share in Legi&s;lation:</HI> For that out of 36 Members which the eight Counties in the Province &s;end to A&s;&s;embly, the three Counties of <HI>Philadel|phia, Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Bucks,</HI> where the Quakers are chiefly &s;ettled, return 26 of that Number; while the 5 remaining Counties, where the&s;e LORDLY RULERS could have no Chance of getting elected, are &s;uffered to &s;end but the other Ten.</P>
<P>That by this iniquitous Policy, the Inhabitants of the&s;e five Frontier-Counties, altho' a great Majority, have been

<P>That they have been made Tributaries to &s;upport the immen&s;e Expence of <HI>Indian Treaties;</HI> to which they chearfully &s;ubmitted, in Hopes that their dear Relati|ons and Fellow Subjects, who have been long detained in barbarous Captivity, would have been re&s;tored; But that in&s;tead of <HI>in&s;i&s;ting</HI> upon the Promi&s;es and Engage|ments made by the Indians to this End, an exten&s;ive and valuable Trade was opened with the&s;e faithle&s;s

<P>But this Triumph of theirs is founded upon a fal&s;e Suppo|&s;ition, that <HI>Quakers</HI> never us'd Arms before.&mdash; Whereas, it can be prov'd that the&s;e People have <HI>taken up Arms,</HI> and <HI>fought well too,</HI> upon many other Occa&s;ions.&mdash;Whoever will take the Trouble to read the printed Trials of G.

<P><Q>And <HI>Jael</HI> went out to meet <HI>Si&s;era,</HI> and &s;aid unto him, Turn in, my Lord, turn into me, <HI>fear not:</HI> And when he had turned in unto her into the Tent, &s;he covered him with a Mantle,</Q> (or Blanket, as you find it expre&s;s'd in the Margin.)</P>
<Q><P>And he &s;aid unto her, give me, I pray thee, a little Water to drink, for I am thir&s;ty; and &s;he opened a Bot|tle of Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and gave him Drink, and covered him.</P>
<P>Again he &s;aid unto her, &s;tand in the Door of the Tent, and it &s;hall be when any Man doth come and enquire of thee and &s;ay, Is there any Man here? that thou &s;hall &s;ay, No.</P>

Then <HI>Jael, Heber</HI>'s Wife, took a Nail of the Tent, and took an Hammer in her Hand, and went &s;oftly unto him, and &s;mote the Nail in his Temples, and fa&s;tened it into the Ground; (for he was fa&s;t a&s;leep and weary) &s;o he died.</P></Q>
<P>Now was this Action (which has every Appearance of Cruelty in it) deemed a Breach of Faith, or a Violation of the Rites of Ho&s;pitality? No.&mdash;In the 5th Chapter we find the Angel of the Lord pronouncing a Ble&s;&s;ing upon her; no doubt for ridding the World of an Oppre&s;&s;or, and a cruel V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lain&mdash;<Q>Ble&s;&s;ed above Women &s;hall <HI>Jael</HI> the Wife of <HI>He|ber</HI> the <HI>Kenite</HI> be, ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall &s;he be above Women in the Tent.</Q></P>
<Q><P>He a&s;ked <HI>Water,</HI> and &s;he gave him <HI>Milk,</HI> &s;he brought forth <HI>Butter</HI> in lordly Di&s;h.</P>

<P>In the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> we have another In&s;tance no le&s;s re|markable than the above&mdash;We find that <HI>Judith</HI> killed <HI>Ho|lofernes</HI> even deceitfully, when it could be done no other Way.&mdash;<HI>Holofernes</HI> was the chief Captain of the Army of <HI>A&s;&s;ur,</HI> who made War again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and when he was go|ing out again&s;t them, he threaten'd in the&s;e Words;&mdash;<Q>I will go forth in my Wrath, and will cover the whole Earth with the Feet of my Army, and I will give them for a Spoil unto them:&mdash;So that their Slain &s;hall fill their Valleys and Brooks, and the River &s;hall be filled with their Dead, till it overflow&mdash;And I will lead them Cap|tives to the utmo&s;t Parts of the Earth.</Q></P>

<P>We are told that in the <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> the <HI>free</HI> Cities of ATHENS and ROME, <Q><HI>The awful Authority of the</HI> PEOPLE, <HI>the &s;acred Privileges of the</HI> PEOPLE, <HI>the inviolable Maje&s;ty of the</HI> PEO|PLE, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unappealable Judgment of the</HI> PEOPLE, were com|mon Phra&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>But it &s;eems that there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en in PENNSYLVANIA, who (to u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Words of the great LO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">NO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> SIDNEY) look upon the People <Q>like <HI>A&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iff D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs,</HI> who ought to <HI>work</HI> and to <HI>fight,</HI> to be <HI>oppre&s;s'd</HI> and <HI>kill'd</HI> for them.</Q>&mdash;And that they have neither <HI>Privileg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>Authority</HI> to complain of their Sufferings, or remon&s;trate their Grievances.</P>
<P>However, I would have &s;uch Men know, that (whatever contracted Sentiments they may entertain) as a Patriot Wri|ter ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "It is the undoubted Right of the Peo|ple, and acknowledg'd to be &s;o in the <HI>Bill of Rights</HI> pa&s;s'd in the Reign of King CHARLES I. and &s;ince by the <HI>Act of Set|tlement</HI> of the CROW<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the REVOLUTION, to repre&s;ent their publick Grievances, and to petition for Redre&s;s to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e who&s;e Duty it is to right them, or to &s;ee them righted: And it is certain, that in all Countries, the People's Misfortunes are greater or le&s;s, in Proportion as this Right is encourag'd or check'd."</P>
<P>It is indeed the be&s;t and only ju&s;t Way that they can take to breathe their Grievances; and whenever this Way has been taken even KINGS have always accepted their Appli|cation.&mdash; The PARLIAMENTS of GREAT BRITAIN too, who are the grand Barriers of our LIBERTY, have always

&s;hewn them&s;elves ready and willing to receive the Complaints of their Principals, and to apply quick Remedies to the Grievances contain'd in them.&mdash; It has, indeed, been al|ways thought highly imprudent, not to &s;ay dangerous, to re&s;i&s;t the Groans of the People, utter'd in this Manner.</P>
<P>This has been a Method, which has always had great Weight with good Men, and has always been a great Terror to Bad.&mdash;It has therefore always been encourag'd or di&s;|courag'd, according to the Innocence or Guilt of Men in Power.</P>

<P>I &s;hall now conclude, Sir, with this Reque&s;t to you, that you will advi&s;e your vi&s;ionary QUAKERS and DON QUIXOTES, to con&s;ider the&s;e Things&mdash;And, that in&s;tead of yoking them&s;elves to CANNON, and dragging them along to defend BARRACKS, and fight WIND-MILLS, they will &s;uffer the Complaints of the People to be heard, their Grievances re|dre&s;s'd, and their Country re&s;cued from total Ruin.&mdash;That they will immediately remove the INDIANS, or whatever el&s;e may create their Jealou&s;y, and give them Cau&s;e to murmur.&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd then we may expect to feel the happy Effects re&s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing from LIBERTY and LAW&mdash;to &s;ee the Quiet of the Pro|vince re&s;tor'd&mdash;and the Harmony and good Order of Govern|ment re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd among&s;t us.</P>
