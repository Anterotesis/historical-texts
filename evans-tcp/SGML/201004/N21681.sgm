<P>THE following Sketch of "The Features of Mr. Jay's Treaty," was made, originally, with a view to a&s;certain, for private &s;atisfaction, the principles and operation of an In&s;trument, which has excited &s;uch exten&s;ive curio&s;ity, and is calculated to produce &s;uch important effects. It is publi&s;hed, however, at the in&s;tance of &s;everal per&s;ons, who think that the &s;ubject &s;hould be placed in every po&s;&s;ible light; and that no citizen can be ju&s;tified at this cri&s;is, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his opi|nions, or in withholding his &s;hare of information from the common &s;tock. But while it is committed to the pre&s;s, I wi&s;h it to be con|&s;idered merely as a text, which may hereafter be extended by com|mentary, or explained by illu&s;tration; and though it will give me plea&s;ure (&s;ince my &s;ole object on this occa&s;ion is the inve&s;tigation of political truth) to &s;ee it become a &s;ource of candid animadver&s;ion; I tru&s;t it will not, according to the cu&s;tom of contending parties, be regarded as an in&s;trument of faction, nor be made the foundation of &s;lander and abu&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FEATURES OF</HI> Mr. Jay's Treaty.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> The origin and progre&s;s of the negociation for the Treaty, are not calculated to excite confidence.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE admini&s;tration of our government have, &s;eemingly at lea&s;t, manife&s;ted a policy favourable to Great Britain, and adver&s;e to France.</P>
<P N="2">2. But the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of Congre&s;s, impre&s;&s;ed with the general ill conduct of Great Britain towards America, were adopting mea&s;ures, of a mild, though retaliating nature, to obtain redre&s;s and indemnification. The injuries complained of were, prin|cipally, 1&s;t. The detention of the we&s;tern po&s;ts&mdash;2dly. The delay in compen&s;ating for the negroes carried off at the clo&s;e of the war&mdash; and 3dly, The &s;poliations committed on our commerce. The reme|dies propo&s;ed, were, principally, 1&s;t. The commercial regulations of Mr. Madi&s;on&mdash;2dly. The non-intercour&s;e propo&s;ition of Mr. Clarke&mdash;3dly. The &s;eque&s;tration motion of Mr. Dayton&mdash;4thly. An embargo&mdash;and 5thly, Military preparation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every plan of the legi&s;lature was, however, &s;u&s;pended, or ra|ther annihilated, by the interpo&s;ition of the executive authority; and Mr. <HI>Jay,</HI> the chief Ju&s;tice of the United States, was taken from his judicial &s;eat, to negociate with Great-Britain, under the influence of
<PB N="6" REF="028527_0005_0FD934873B806C00">the prevailing &s;entiment of the people, <HI>for the redre&s;s of our wrongs.</HI> Query&mdash;Are not his commi&s;&s;ion and the execution of it, at variance? Is any one of our wrongs actually redre&s;&s;ed? Is not an atonement to Great Britain, for the injuries which &s;he <HI>pretends</HI> to have &s;uffered, a preliminary &s;tipulation?</P>
<P N="4">4. The political dogma of Mr. Jay are well known; his predi|lection, in relation to France and Great Britain, has not been di&s;|gui&s;ed; and even on the topic of American complaints, his reports, while in the office of &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, and his adjudications while in the office of chief ju&s;tice, were not calculated to point him out as the &s;ingle citizen of America, fitted for the &s;ervice in which he was employed. Query&mdash;Do not per&s;onal feelings too often dic|tate and govern the public conduct of mini&s;ters? But whatever may have been his per&s;onal di&s;qualifications, they are ab&s;orbed in the more important con&s;ideration of the apparent violence committed by Mr. Jay's appointment, on the e&s;&s;ential principles of the con&s;titution. That topic, however, has already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and we may pa&s;s to the manner of negociating the treaty in England, which was at once ob&s;cure and illu&s;ory. We heard of Mr. Jay's diplomatic ho|nours; of the royal and mini&s;terial courte&s;y which was &s;hewn to him, and of the convivial boards to which he was invited: but, no more! Mr. Jay, enveloped by a dangerous confidence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the intuitive facul|ties of his own mind, or the inexhau&s;tible fund of his diplomatic in|formation, neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nor wi&s;hed for external aid; while the Briti&s;h negociator, be&s;ides his own acquirements, entered on the points of negociation, fraught with all the auxiliary &s;agacity of his brother mini&s;ters, and with all the practical knowledge of the mo&s;t, enlightened merchants of a commercial nation. The re&s;ult corre|&s;ponds with that inau&s;picious &s;tate of things. Mr. Jay was driven from the ground of an injured, to the ground of an agre&s;&s;ing, party; he made atonement for imaginary wrongs, before he was allowed ju&s;tice for real ones; he converted the <HI>re&s;entments</HI> of the American citizens (under the impre&s;&s;ions of which he was avowedly &s;ent to England) into <HI>amity and concord;</HI> and &s;eems to have been &s;o anxious to rivet a commercial chain about the neck of America, that he even forgot, or di&s;regarded, a principal item of her own produce, (cotton) in order to make a &s;weeping &s;acrifice to the in&s;atiable appetite of his maritime antagoni&s;t. But the idea of the treaty, given by Mr. Pitt in an&s;wer to Mr. Fox, who, before he had &s;een, applauded it as an act of liberality and ju&s;tice towards America, was the fir&s;t autho|ritative alarm to our intere&s;ts and our feelings. "When the treaty is laid before the parliament (&s;aid the mini&s;ter) you will be&s;t judge whether any improper conce&s;&s;ion has been made to America!"</P>
<P N="5">5. The treaty being &s;ent her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for ratification, the Pre&s;ident and the Senate pur&s;ue the my&s;terious plan in which it was negociated. I has been intimated, that till the meeting of the &s;enate, the in&s;tru|ment was not communicated even to the mo&s;t confidential officers of the government: and the fir&s;t re&s;olution taken by the &s;enate, was to &s;top the lips and ears of its members again&s;t every po&s;&s;ibility of giving
<PB N="7" REF="028527_0006_0FD9348D94ED19F8">or receiving information. Every man, like Mr. Jay, was pre&s;umed to be in&s;pired. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, however, &s;ome oc|currences fla&s;hed from beneath the veil of &s;ecrecy; and it is conjec|tured that the whole treaty was, at one time, in jeopardy. But the rhetoric of a mini&s;ter (not remarkable for the <HI>volubility of his tongue</HI>) who was brought po&s;t-ha&s;te from the country; the danger of expo&s;ing to odium and di&s;grace the di&s;tingui&s;hed American characters, who would be affected by a total rejection of the treaty; and the feeble, but operative, vote of a member tran&s;ported from the languor and imbecility of a &s;ick room, to decide in the &s;enate a great national que&s;tion, who&s;e merits he had not heard di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; triumphed over principle, argument and decorum!</P>
<P N="6">6. But &s;till the treaty remains <HI>unratified;</HI> for, unle&s;s the Briti&s;h government &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to &s;u&s;pend the obnoxious twelfth article, (in favour of which, however, many <HI>patriotic</HI> members declared their readine&s;s to vote) the whole is de&s;troyed by the terms of the ratifi|cation: and if the Briti&s;h government &s;hall agree to add an article allowing the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, the whole mu&s;t return for the recon&s;idera|tion of the &s;enate. But the forms of my&s;tery are &s;till pre&s;erved by our government; and attempts to deceive the people have been made abroad, upon a vain pre&s;umption, that the treaty could remain <HI>a &s;ecret,</HI> till it became obligatory as <HI>a law.</HI></P>
<P>For in&s;tance, in <HI>Fenno's</HI> paper of the 25th of June, it is unequi|vocally declared, "the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, was ratified ye&s;terday by the Senate of the United States; and, even while he corrects that mi&s;take in the paper of the following day, he commits <HI>an error</HI> of a more extraordinary kind (particularly when we con&s;ider that he is the confidential per&s;on, who printed the treaty for the u&s;e of the &s;enate) by a&s;&s;erting, that in the twelfth article, "the United States are prohibited from exporting to Europe from the &s;aid &s;tates, &s;ugar, coffee, cotton and cocoa, <HI>the produce of any of the We&s;t India i&s;lands.</HI>" The fact mu&s;t have been known to Mr. Fenno, that the prohibition operates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iver&s;ally; whether the prohibited ar|ticles are the produce of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, of the Ea&s;t Indies, of the United States, or of any other part of the world. The next e&s;&s;ay to render the envelopements of the treaty &s;till more opaque, ap|peared in the American Daily Adverti&s;er, of the 27th of June. The writer (who is &s;aid to be a member of the Senate) likewi&s;e re|gards the ratification, in his introduction, as a perfect one; and af|ter giving a glo&s;s to the general texture of the treaty, he a&s;cribes the obnoxious principle of the twelfth article, <HI>to an error which, it appears, has been inadvertently introduced.</HI> An error inadvertently introduced into an in&s;trument, which was under the con&s;ideration of the chief ju&s;tice of the United States, and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, for a term of eight months! and introduced too, into a part of that very article, which is made the &s;ole foundation of the whole commercial &s;uper&s;truc|ture!! Whenever the twelfth article cea&s;es, the treaty declares every other article, except the ten fir&s;t articles, &s;hall al&s;o cea&s;e! But the author of that &s;ketch proceeds one &s;tep further&mdash;he &s;ays, "that
<PB N="8" REF="028527_0007_0FD9348E9A1AB570"><HI>every cau&s;e of offence or colli&s;ion</HI> towards the French, &s;eems to have been &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided, in the progre&s;s of the negociation;" for, "no article of the treaty <HI>cla&s;hes in the &s;malle&s;t degree,</HI> with the obliga|tions and engagements contracted with that gallant nation!" Let the treaty &s;peak for it&s;elf&mdash;it is more to be hoped than expected, that the voice of France &s;hould not likewi&s;e be heard in oppo&s;ition to &s;o bold an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Nothing is &s;ettled by the Treaty.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The we&s;tern po&s;ts are <HI>to be given up.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The northern boundary of the United States is <HI>to be amicably &s;ettled.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The river meant by St. Croix river in the treaty, is <HI>to be &s;ettled.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The payment for &s;poliations is <HI>to be adju&s;ted and made.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The ultimate regulation of the We&s;t India trade is to depend on a negotiation <HI>to be made</HI> in the cour&s;e of two years after the termi|nation of the exi&s;ting war.</P>
<P N="6">6. The que&s;tion of neutral bottoms making neutral goods is <HI>to be con&s;idered</HI> at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="7">7. The articles that may be deemed contraband, are <HI>to be</HI> &s;ettled at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="8">8. The equalization of duties laid by the contracting parties on one another, is <HI>to be hereafter treated of.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. All the commercial articles depend on the exi&s;tence of the twelfth article, which may continue twelve years, if it is &s;o agreed within two years after the expiration of the war; but if it is not &s;o agreed, it expires, and with it all the dependent parts of the treaty. Query&mdash;Does not the Senate's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the twelfth article bring us to the &s;ame ground?</P>
<P N="10">10. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Jay's negociation is left open by the twenty-eighth article, for alteration, amendment and addition, by new articles, which, when agreed upon and ratified, <HI>&s;hall become a part of this treaty.</HI></P>
<P>Query&mdash;Does not the hi&s;tory of treaties prove, that whenever commi&s;&s;ioners have been appointed by the parties, to take all the &s;ub|jects of their di&s;pute <HI>ad referendum,</HI> for the &s;ake of getting rid of an immediate pre&s;&s;ure, and patching up a peace, the matter terminates in <HI>creating,</HI> not in <HI>&s;ettling</HI> differences?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> The Treaty contains a colourable, but no real, Reciprocity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The &s;econd article provides for the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts in June, 1796; but it &s;tipulates, that in the mean time, the citizens of the United States &s;hall not &s;ettle within the precincts and juri&s;diction of tho&s;e po&s;ts; that the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers there &s;hall hold and enjoy all their property of every kind, real and per&s;onal; and that when the po&s;ts are &s;urrendered, &s;uch &s;ettlers &s;hall have an election
<PB N="9" REF="028527_0008_0FD9349278B07F38">either to remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or to become American citizens. Query&mdash;Were not the we&s;tern po&s;ts, and all their precincts and ju|ri&s;diction, the ab&s;olute property of the United States by the treaty of peace? Query&mdash;What equivalent is given for this ce&s;&s;ion of the terri|tory of the United States to a foreign power? Query&mdash;How far do the precincts and juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts extend? Query&mdash;Does not the treaty give an implied a&s;&s;ent to major Campbell's claim, by adopt|ing its language, as far as the falls of the Miami, and to the northern claim upon the territories of New-York and Vermont?</P>
<P N="2">2. The third article &s;tipulates that the two contracting parties may frequent the ports of <HI>either party,</HI> on the ea&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi. Query&mdash;What ports has Great Britain on the ea&s;tern banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi?</P>
<P N="3">3. The third article likewi&s;e opens an amicable intercour&s;e on the lakes; but excludes us from their &s;ea-ports, and the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay company; and excludes them from navigating our Atlantic rivers, higher than the highe&s;t port of entry in each. Query &mdash;What are the limits of the Hud&s;on's bay company? Query&mdash;What equivalent do the United States obtain for the general freedom of navigation, portage and pa&s;&s;age? For it mu&s;t be remembered, that the Briti&s;h rivers penetrate the heart of the country, but of tho&s;e we can take no advantage; while Great Britain is in fact admitted to all the advantages of which our Atlantic rivers are &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;ixth and &s;eventh articles provide for &s;atisfying every demand which Great Britain has been able, at any time, to make again&s;t the United States (the payment of the Briti&s;h debts due be|fore the war, and the indemnification for ve&s;&s;els captured within our territorial juri&s;diction) but the provi&s;ion made for the American claims upon Great Britain, is not equally explicit or efficient in its terms, nor is it co-exten&s;ive with the object. Query&mdash;Why is the demand for the negroes, carried off by the Briti&s;h troops, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, waved, or abondoned? The preamble to the treaty recites an inten|tion to <HI>terminate the differences</HI> between the nations: was not the affair of the negroes a difference between the nations? and how has it been terminated?</P>
<P N="5">5. The ninth article &s;tipulates, that the &s;ubjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States, re&s;pectively, who now hold lands within the territories of either nation, &s;hall hold the lands in the &s;ame manner as natives do. Query&mdash;What is the relative pro|portion of lands &s;o held? Query&mdash;The effect to revive the claims of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who, either as traitors or aliens, have forfeited their property within the re&s;pective &s;tates? Query&mdash;The operation of &s;uch a compact on the internal policy of the union, combined with the &s;olemn recognition of a colony of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, profe&s;&s;ing and owing allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, though &s;ettled within the ac|knowledged territory of the United States, by virtue of the &s;econd article?</P>
<P N="6">6. The tenth article declares, that neither party &s;hall &s;eque&s;ter or confi&s;cate the debts or property in the funds, &amp;c. belonging to the
<PB N="10" REF="028527_0009_0FD9349548633398">citizens of the other, in ca&s;e of a war, or of national differences. Great Britain has fleets and armies; America has none. Query&mdash; Does not this, &s;upported by other provi&s;ions, which forbid our chang|ing the commercial &s;ituation of Great Britain, or impo&s;ing higher duties on her than on other nations, deprive the United States of their be&s;t means of retaliation and coercion? Query&mdash;Is it not taking from America her only weapon of defence; but from Great Britain the lea&s;t of two weapons which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es? What is the relative proportion held by the citizens of the contracting nations, re&s;pectively, in the funds, &amp;c. of each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. The twelfth article opens to our ve&s;&s;els, not exceeding &s;eventy tons, an intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h We&s;t India i&s;lands, during the pre&s;ent war, and for two years after: but it prohibits our exporting from the United States, mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, cocoa, coffee, or cotton, to any part of the world, whether tho&s;e articles are brought from Briti&s;h, French, or Spani&s;h i&s;lands, or even rai&s;ed (as cotton is) within our own territory. Query&mdash;Are ve&s;&s;els of &s;eventy tons equal to maintain the mo&s;t beneficial part of our trade with the We&s;t Indies, the tran&s;portation of lumber, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.? Query&mdash;Do we not, <HI>in the time of war</HI> (and the continuance of the privelege, for more than two years after the war depends on the &s;ituation in which his maje&s;ty of Great Britain &s;hall then find him&s;elf in relation to the i&s;lands) enjoy a greater pri|vilege, under the temporary proclamations of the colonial governors, than this article admits? Query&mdash;Have not the articles which we are prohibited from exporting, formed, of late, a valuable part of our trade? Is not cocoa chiefly cultivated by the Spaniards? Is not cotton a &s;taple of America? Is our own own con&s;umption equal to our importation or growth of the prohibited articles? Will not the want of a vent for any &s;urplus quantity, affect the other branches of our commerce, dimini&s;h the demand for &s;hip building, and injure our agriculture? If we are now thrown out of this branch of the car|rying trade, &s;hall we be ever able to recover it? and, in &s;hort, will not the lo&s;s be of la&s;ting detriment to all our maritime exertions?</P>
<P N="8">8. The thirteenth article admits us to trade in the Briti&s;h &s;ettle|ments in the Ea&s;t Indies: but it excludes us from any &s;hare in the coa&s;ting trade of that country; it forbids our penetrating the interior of the country, or holding an intercour&s;e with the natives, unle&s;s under a licen&s;e from the local Briti&s;h government; and it compels us to land all the articles that are there &s;hipped, in the United States. Is not China the independent territory of the emperor? Is not Canton an open port acce&s;&s;ible to all nations? Do we not obtain there, and at independent places in the Ea&s;t Indies with which we have, at pre&s;ent, an uninterrupted communication, tea, porcelain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ankeens, &s;ilk, &amp;c. upon the principles of a free trade? Does not a very advantageous part of the trade in that quarter of the globe, con&s;i&s;t in the exchange of the products and manufactures of the Ea&s;t Indies for tho&s;e of China, and <HI>vice ver&s;a?</HI> Do not our importations of Ea&s;t India goods far exceed our con&s;umption? Is not the trade which we carry on with tho&s;e goods in Europe, highly beneficial?
<PB N="11" REF="028527_0010_0FD9349848BE9620">Are not &s;ugar and coffee a part of our importations from India, and does not the 12th article prohibit our re-exporting them? Does our trade to Europe, founded on the previous intercour&s;e with India, depend on the Briti&s;h licence; and can it be maintained, under the di&s;advantage of a double voyage? Are we not, every voyage, making favourable impre&s;&s;ions on the natives of China? Do we not partici|pate, at pre&s;ent, in the carrying trade of that country? Does not our intere&s;t in it increa&s;e rapidly?</P>
<P N="9">9. The &s;everal articles that regulate the rights and priveleges of the contracting parties within their re&s;pective territories, in ca&s;e either of them is engaged in a war, may cea&s;e in two years after the pre&s;ent war is terminated, and cannot be protracted beyond twelve years. Query&mdash;Are not all the&s;e advantages, in effect, <HI>exclu&s;ively favoura|ble to Great Britain,</HI> a principal maritime power of Europe; often engaged in wars; and intere&s;ted to obtain for her &s;hips, her colonies, and her&s;elf, the ports and &s;upplies of this exten&s;ive continent?</P>
<P>Is it probable that, during the longe&s;t po&s;&s;ible exi&s;tence of this treaty (twelve years) America will be engaged in maritime wars, will want Engli&s;h ports as a refuge for men of war, or as a retreat for prizes? Or that it will, during that period, be of importance to her objects, to prevent her enemies from arming in Engli&s;h ports, or &s;elling their prizes there?</P>
<P N="10">10. The twenty-&s;econd article provides for &s;hips of war being ho&s;|pitably treated in the ports of the re&s;pective contracting parties; and that officers &s;hall be treated with the re&s;pect that is due to the com|mi&s;&s;ions which they bear. Query&mdash;Could not the principle of reci|procity, as well as humanity, &s;ugge&s;t to Mr. Jay, that &s;ome provi|&s;ion &s;hould be made to protect our citizen &s;ailors from the &s;angs of Briti&s;h pre&s;s-gangs in England; and from the horrors of their pri&s;on-&s;hips in the We&s;t Indies? Were the commi&s;&s;ions of his Bri|tannic maje&s;ty of more regard than the liberties of American freemen? Or, was it unknown, that thou&s;ands of our &s;ailors have been occa&s;ion|ally en&s;laved by the impre&s;s tyranny of the Briti&s;h government? Or, that thou&s;ands have lo&s;t their lives in noxious pri&s;ons, while their ve&s;&s;els were carried into Briti&s;h ports for "LEGAL ADJUDI|CATION?"</P>
<P N="11">11. The fourteenth article provides for a perfect liberty of com|merce and navigation, and for the accommodation of traders; but &s;ubject always to the laws and &s;tatutes of the two countries re&s;pectively: Query&mdash;Are not the laws and &s;tatutes of England infinitely more rigid, on the &s;ubjects of this article, than the laws and &s;tatutes of America?</P>

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> The Treaty is an In&s;trument of Party.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s in which Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion was projected, evinced the exi&s;tence of two parties, upon the que&s;tion, whether it was more our intere&s;t to be allied with the repub|lic of France, than with the monarchy of Great Britain. Query&mdash;Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="12" REF="028527_0011_0FD93499C95EF0E8">not the general complexion of the treaty decide the que&s;tion in favour of the alliance with Great Britain? Query&mdash;Whether that com|plexion does not manife&s;tly ari&s;e from the provi&s;ions, for admitting a Briti&s;h colony within our territory, in the neighbourhood of the we&s;tern po&s;ts; for admitting the whole Briti&s;h nation, without an equivalent, into a participation of our territory on the ea&s;tern bank of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; for naturalizing all the holders of lands; for opening a general intercour&s;e with their traders on the lakes, in the interior of our country, rendering (as it is idly &s;aid) the local advantages of each party common to both; for regulating the external trade of the two nations with each other; for admitting citizens to be puni&s;hed as pirates, who take commi&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. from a belligerent power, adver&s;e to either contracting party; for fettering the operations of our treaty with France; for &s;urrendering criminals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. The mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by one party to retaliate the injuries offered by Great Britain to our territorial, commercial and politi|cal rights, were oppo&s;ed by the other, preci&s;ely as the treaty oppo&s;es them. For in&s;tance:&mdash;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) Mr. Madi&s;on projects a regulation of our commerce with Great Britain, by which the ho&s;tile &s;pirit of that nation, might be contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led on the footing of its intere&s;t. The treaty legitimi&s;es the oppo&s;ition, which was given to the mea&s;ure in Congre&s;s, by declaring in article fifteen, "that no other or higher duties &s;hall be paid by the &s;hips or merchandi&s;e of the one party, in the ports of the other, than &s;uch as are paid by the like ve&s;&s;els or merchandi&s;e of all other nations; nor &s;hall any other or higher duty be impo&s;ed in one coun|try on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce, or manufactures of the other, than are, or &s;hall be, payable on the im|portation of the like articles of the growth, &amp;c. of any foreign country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) Mr. Clarke propo&s;es to manife&s;t and enforce the public re|&s;entment, by prohibiting all intercour&s;e between the two nations. The treaty de&s;troys the very right to attempt that &s;pecies of national denunciation, by declaring in the &s;ame article, that "no prohibition &s;hall be impo&s;ed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties re&s;pectively, which &s;hall not equally extend to all other nations."</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) But Mr. Dayton moves, and the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;up|port his motion, for the &s;eque&s;tration of Briti&s;h debts, &amp;c. to en&s;ure a fund for paying the &s;poliations committed on our trade. The treaty (without regarding the re&s;pect due to the commi&s;&s;ion which is borne by our members of Congre&s;s) not only de&s;poils the government of this important in&s;trument to coerce a powerful, yet intere&s;ted adver&s;ary into acts of ju&s;tice, but enters likewi&s;e into a commentary, which, con&s;idering the conduct of one of the branches of our legi&s;lature, Lord Grenville, con&s;i&s;tently with decorum, could not have expre&s;&s;ed, or at lea&s;t, Mr. Jay, for the &s;ake of our national dignity, ought not to have adopted. The tenth article declares, that "neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other,
<PB N="13" REF="028527_0012_0FD9349F07FF3DC0">nor &s;hares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, &s;hall ever, in any event of war or na|tional difference, be &s;eque&s;tered or con&s;i&s;cated, <HI>it being unju&s;t and im|politic,</HI> that debts and engagements contracted and made by indivi|duals having con&s;idence in each other and in their re&s;pective govern|ments, &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed or impaired by national authority on account of national differences and di&s;contents." The terms are very &s;imilar to tho&s;e that gave Mr. Dayton offence in a &s;peech pro|nounced by Mr. Ames; and certainly it will be deemed no mitiga|tion, that the charge of committing "<HI>an unju&s;t and impolitic</HI> act," has been wantonly engrafted upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn of all in&s;truments. &mdash;a public treaty! Query:&mdash;Would Lord Grenville have con&s;ented to brand his Royal Ma&s;ter with the title of <HI>Great Sea Robber,</HI> if Mr. Jay's urbanity could have permitted him to borrow the epithet from another member of Congre&s;s, in order to in&s;ert it, in the article that relates to the Briti&s;h &s;poliations on our trade? But perhaps, Mr. Jay forgot, that the commentary operated as a reflection on the government of the United States, and only meant it as a reproach to Great Britain, for &s;eque&s;tering during the late war, and retaining at this moment, the property belonging to Maryland, lying in the bank of England. It might, likewi&s;e, be intended as a &s;atire upon the parliamentary &s;eque&s;tration of French property in the famous "In|tercour&s;e Act:" or, perhaps, Mr. Jay anticipated the revolution in Holland, and de&s;igned his commentary as a warning again&s;t the &s;eizing of Dutch property, public and private; which, however, has &s;ince taken place, in &s;pite of his &s;olemn admonition.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="3">3. The trials that had occurred relative to the equipment of French privateers in our ports; and the enli&s;tment of our citizens in the &s;ervice of the republic, had produced &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment in the cour&s;e of party pur&s;uits. The&s;e are obviated by the treaty. The Briti&s;h nation by which the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia has always been &s;upplied with naval officers, and who&s;e fleets and armies are always crowded with volunteers from other nations, con&s;ents that her &s;ubjects &s;hall not &s;erve again&s;t us; and &s;tipulates that our citizens &s;hall not &s;erve again&s;t her. This contract is made with a power actually engaged in a war; and &s;eldom more than &s;even years clear of one; by a power at peace, not liable, from her local po&s;ition, and political con&s;titu|tion, to be involved in war, and in &s;trict alliance with the nation again&s;t whom the &s;tipulation will immediately operate. Captain Barney and the other Americans, who have joined the arms of France, are thus involved in the mo&s;t &s;erious dilemma. If they expatriate them&s;elves, they may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape the vengeance of the American government; but will that &s;ave them from the vengeance of Great Britain, who&s;e conce&s;&s;ions on the doctrine of expatriation are not quite &s;o liberal? By the bye, it may here be &s;ea&s;onably repeated, that while Mr. Jay was &s;o willing to prevent American citizens from <HI>entering</HI> into the &s;ervice of France, he might &s;urely have taken &s;ome pains to &s;ecure them from being <HI>pre&s;&s;ed</HI> into the &s;er|vice of England. He would have found, on enquiry, that the in|&s;tances
<PB N="14" REF="028527_0013_0FD934A240377350">of the latter kind are infinitely more numerous than of the former. But it is enough that the mea&s;ure will be introductory of a law, favourable to the view of a party which reprobates every idea of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French, and cultivates every means of conciliating the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has, likewi&s;e, been thought by &s;ome politicians, that the energies of our executive department require every aid that can be given to them, in order more effectually to re&s;i&s;t and controul the popular branches of the government. Hence we find the treaty|making power employed in that &s;ervice; and Congre&s;s cannot exer|ci&s;e a legi&s;lative di&s;cretion on the prohibited points (though it did not participate in making the ce&s;&s;ion of its authority) without a decla|ration of war again&s;t Great Britain. George the third enjoys by the treaty a more complete negative to bind us as &s;tates, than he ever claimed over us as colonies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> The treaty is a violation of the general principles of neutrality, and is in colli&s;ion with the po&s;itive previous engagements which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between America and France.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is a general principle of the law of nations, that during the exi&s;tence of a war, neutral powers &s;hall not, by favour or by treaty, &s;o alter the &s;ituation of one of the belligerent parties, as to enable him more advantageou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute ho&s;tilities again&s;t his adver&s;ary. If, likewi&s;e, a neutral power &s;hall refu&s;e or evade treating with one of the parties, but eagerly enter into a treaty with the other, it is a partiality, that amounts to a breach of neutrality. The&s;e po&s;itions may be &s;upported by the authority of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed writers on the &s;ubject; but it will be &s;ufficient in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to cite the conduct of Great Britain her&s;elf. Thus, it has been adjudged by Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> "that if a neutral &s;hip trades to a French colony, with all the privileges of a French &s;hip, <HI>and is thus adopted and naturalized,</HI> it mu&s;t be looked upon as a French &s;hip, liable to be taken." See <HI>judge Black&s;tone's reports,</HI> 1 <HI>vol. p.</HI> 313, 314. Ac|cording to he principle on which this judgment was given, the act of i&s;&s;uing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emorable orders of the 6th of November, 1793, and the con&s;equent &s;eizure of all our ve&s;&s;els, are attempted to be ju&s;tified. Great Britain alledges (when it is injurious to France) that trading with the French i&s;lands, <HI>on a footing not allowed before the war,</HI> is a breach of neutrality, and cau&s;e of con&s;i&s;cation: and, therefore, Great Britain mu&s;t al&s;o admit, at lea&s;t America will not deny, that trading with the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, on a footing not allowed before the war; or, in different words, altering and enlarging the commercial relations of the two countries, is equally a breach of our neutrality towards France. When the &s;word is found to cut both ways, the party who u&s;es it, has no right to complain.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we have, on the one hand, evaded the overtures of a treaty with France, and on the other hand, &s;olicited a treaty from Great Britain, are facts public and notorious. Let us enquire, then,
<PB N="15" REF="028527_0014_0FD934A3937C20F0">what Great Britain has gained on the occa&s;ion, to enable her more advantageou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute her ho&s;tilities again&s;t France.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) <HI>Great Britain has gained time.</HI> As nothing is &s;ettled by the treaty, &s;he has it in her power to turn all the chances of the war in her favour; and, in the interim, being relieved from the odium and embarra&s;&s;ment of adding America to her enemies, the current of her operations again&s;t France is undivided, and will of cour&s;e flow with greater vigour and certainty. We have been for &s;o many years &s;atis|fied with <HI>the promi&s;es of the treaty of peace,</HI> that Great Britain has cau&s;e to expect, at lea&s;t, an equal period of credit, for <HI>the promi&s;es of the treaty of amity.</HI> If, indeed, it is true, that the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by Lord Grenville to Mr. Jay, for declining an immediate &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, were, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the Briti&s;h traders might have time to arrange their out-&s;tanding bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>a privilege that is expre&s;sly granted by the treaty,</HI> and could not therefore, furni&s;h a real excu&s;e for delay; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the Briti&s;h government might be able to a&s;certain what would be the probable effect of the &s;urrender, on the Indians; <HI>a re|&s;ervation that demon&s;trates an intention to be governed by events;</HI> we can very well account for the late exten&s;ive &s;hipment of artillery and ammunition to Canada; and may ea&s;ily calculate the importance of <HI>gaining time,</HI> in order to promote the American, as well as European, objects of Great Britain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) <HI>Great Britain gains &s;upplies for her We&s;t India colonies;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> for a period almo&s;t limited to the continuance of the war, under circum&s;tances which incapacitate her from furni&s;hing the colonial &s;up|plies her&s;elf; and, indeed, compel her to invite the aid of all na|tions, in furni&s;hing provi&s;ions for her own dome&s;tic &s;upport. The &s;upplies may be carried to the i&s;lands either in <HI>American</HI> bottoms <HI>not exceeding &s;eventy tons,</HI> or in <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> bottoms of <HI>any tonnage.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) <HI>Great Britain gains an advantage over France, by prohibiting the exportation of &s;ugar, &amp;c.</HI> in con&s;equence of which the colonies of France mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, remain un&s;upplied with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. as they can only in general pay for them in tho&s;e articles, <HI>who&s;e u&s;e is confined to the American con&s;umption.</HI> It will be remembered, that the produce of the French i&s;lands has of late con&s;tituted a great part of our European remittances. If, therefore, that trade is cut off, and at the &s;ame time, be&s;ides employing <HI>our own &s;mall craft</HI> of &s;eventy tons, Great Britain is allowed, <HI>to any extent of tonnage,</HI> to be our We&s;t India factor, it is obvious that our con&s;umption of &s;ugar, coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. will be abundantly &s;upplied, without maintaining an intercour&s;e with the French, or even with the Ea&s;t Indies, to pro|cure any of tho&s;e articles. Perhaps this method, though le&s;s bold, will be more effectual to prevent our furni&s;hing the French i&s;lands with provi&s;ion, than declaring them to be in a &s;tate of blockade, and &s;eizing the ve&s;&s;els that attempt to vi&s;it them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(4.) <HI>It is another important gain to Great Baitain</HI> (which might, likewi&s;e, have been adverted to under the feature of reciprocity) <HI>that, to any extent of tonnage, her ve&s;&s;els may carry on the We&s;t India trade for us,</HI> either to &s;upply our dome&s;tic con&s;umption, or European en|gagements,
<PB N="16" REF="028527_0015_0FD934A5146D7248"><HI>&s;ubject to no other or higher duties than our own ve&s;&s;els,</HI> while our own ve&s;&s;els are re&s;tricted to a pitiful &s;ize, and circum&s;cribed to a particular voyage. But whatever may be thought of the benefit of acquiring for America even this &s;canty participation in the We&s;t India trade, no one (after the rejection of the twelfth article) will deny that the whole mea&s;ure changes the relative &s;ituation of the two countries, avowedly in favour of Great Britain, and operatively injurious to France; and every &s;uch change is derogatory to our boa&s;ted neutral character.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(5.) <HI>The admi&s;&s;ion of Great Britain to all the commercial advanta|ges of the mo&s;t favoured nation, and the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon our le|gi&s;lative independence,</HI> as &s;tated in the <HI>party feature</HI> of the treaty, are proofs of predilection and partiality in the American government, which cannot fail to improve the re&s;ources of Great Britain, and to impair the intere&s;ts, as well as the attachments, of France.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(6.) <HI>The a&s;&s;ent to the &s;eizure of all provi&s;ion-&s;hips,</HI> and that, in effect, upon any pretext, at a period when Great Britain is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for provi&s;ions, as well as France; and when the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>&s;ubduing by famine</HI> has been adopted by the former again&s;t the latter nation, is clearly changing our po&s;ition, as an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dependent republic, in a man|ner detrimental to our original ally. That our merchants will be paid a rea&s;onable profit for their cargoes, &amp;c. may render the mea|&s;ure more palatable to us; even under the lo&s;s of the return cargo, the derangement of the voyage, and the de&s;truction of the &s;pirit of commercial enterpri&s;e; but that con&s;ideration cannot render it le&s;s offen&s;ive to France. It may properly be here remarked, that Swe|den and Denmark have obtained, by a &s;pirited re&s;i&s;tance, an actual indemnification for the &s;eizures which have heretofore taken place, and an exemption from all &s;uch outrages in future; while America has only put tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, <HI>in a train of negociation,</HI> and has given a <HI>legitimate effect</HI> to tho&s;e which are to come. The order, which, the Engli&s;h gazettes &s;ay, has recently been i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing American provi&s;ion-&s;hips, on their pa&s;&s;age to France, ought not, therefore, to be complained of, as it is merely an exerci&s;e, by an|ticipation, of the right granted by the treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(7.) <HI>Great Britain has gained the right of preventing our Citizens from being volunteers in the armies or &s;hips of France!</HI> This is not &s;imply the grant of a new right to Great Britain, but is, at the &s;ame time, a po&s;itive deprivation of a benefit, hitherto enjoyed by France. Neither the laws of nations, nor our municipal con&s;titution and laws, prohibited our citizens from <HI>going to another country,</HI> and <HI>there,</HI> either for the &s;ake of honour, reward, or in&s;truction, &s;erving in a foreign navy, or army:&mdash;Colonel <HI>O&s;wald</HI> and many others have done it:&mdash; Captain <HI>Barney</HI> and many others are doing it. But a proclamation mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue to recal all &s;uch volunteers, and puni&s;hment mu&s;t follow di&s;obedience, if the twenty-fir&s;t article of the treaty is to be effectu|ated, as the &s;upreme law of the land.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(8.) <HI>Great Britain has gained a right to treat and puni&s;h as pirates, any of our citizens who &s;hall accept, even while they are in France, any
<PB N="17" REF="028527_0016_0FD934A9D3FD5710">commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to arm a privateer, or letter of marque. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s true, that a &s;imilar provi&s;ion is contained in other treaties; but we are now only con&s;idering <HI>the alterations</HI> which are made by the treaty under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in favour of Great Britain, and inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s to France, How far there exi&s;ts a power to define piracy, <HI>by treaty,</HI> will be remarked in delineating another &s;cature of Mr. Jay's diplomatic off|&s;pring.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(9.) <HI>Great Britain has doubly g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ned, by obtaining in our ports, an a&s;ylum for her &s;hips of war, privateers, prizes, &amp;c. &s;tipulating for an exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e of her enemies, other (it is admitted) than France.</HI> The twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth articles of the projected treaty, are nearly copied from the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting treaty with France. It would be curious, however, to reflect on the very different motives, which mu&s;t ju&s;tify (if the idea of ju&s;tification could, in the late in&s;tance, be at all admi&s;&s;ible) the&s;e analogous grants. The conce&s;&s;ion to France was made <HI>when we were at war, and &s;he was not;</HI> it was made upon a certainty of <HI>reciprocal advantage;</HI> and it was made <HI>as a price</HI> for obtaining the aid of <HI>that gallant nation,</HI> in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence. The conce&s;&s;ion is made to Great Britain <HI>when &s;he is at war, and we are not;&mdash;without any rational pro&s;pect of deriving any reciprocal advantage from it;</HI> and under &s;uch circum&s;tances of injury and in&s;ult, as might have admoni&s;hed us <HI>to re&s;erve it as the price for obtaining aid from other nations, in re&s;i&s;ting her ho&s;tilities,</HI> in|&s;tead of paying it for &s;miles without affection, and promi&s;es without &s;incerity. When we were making treaties with Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. did we not expre&s;sly exclude them from &s;uch important, and, as we have already &s;eriou&s;ly experienced, &s;uch dangerous privileges?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But it will be a&s;ked, perhaps what mighty benefit has Great Bri|tain gained, in this ca&s;e, at the expense of France, &s;ince the prior &s;imilar privileges of France are exclu&s;ive? <HI>An&s;wer:</HI>&mdash;That as the privilege of Great Britain will operate again&s;t every other nation, it will immediately affect the French republic's alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with the United Provinces, which preceded the ratifica|tion, at lea&s;t, of the treaty: and it may, eventually, have the &s;ame pernicious influence in relation to Pru&s;&s;ia, Spain and Portugal, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition to change &s;ides, in the pre&s;ent war, has been unequivo|cally expre&s;&s;ed. Thus, though Holland and Pru&s;&s;ia made treaties with us, long before Great Britain would admit the idea of a nego|ciation, and though Spain and Portugal are the only cu&s;tomers, who furni&s;h us with the ready money balance, for the very purpo&s;e of paying our annual accumulation of debt to Britain, the harbours of America are open to their ve&s;&s;els <HI>as prizes,</HI> but &s;hut to them as <HI>friends:</HI> They may be brought hither and &s;old by their enemies: but if they have captured their enemy, all, but common nece&s;&s;aries, &s;hall be denied to them! The habits, bias, and opinions of a people, ought not to be altogether di&s;regarded in making a treaty. What hone&s;t, feeling American, could patiently &s;ee an Engli&s;hman, <HI>our &s;un&s;hine ally,</HI> bringing into our ports, <HI>as prizes,</HI> the &s;hips of Holland, <HI>our ally in the times that tried min's &s;ouls;</HI>&mdash;a republic, indi&s;&s;olubly

<P N="3">3. But it is time to advert to <HI>the ca&s;es of colli&s;ion</HI> between the two treaties; and the&s;e are of &s;uch a nature as to produce a violation of the &s;pirit, though not a po&s;itive violation of the words, of the pre|vious engagements, that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between France and America&mdash;They are <HI>cau&s;es of offence, and cla&s;h in the highe&s;t degree.</HI></P>

By our treaty with France, and indeed with &s;everal other nations, <HI>it is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that free ve&s;&s;els</HI> &s;hall <HI>make free goods.</HI> At the time of entering into the &s;tipulation, and even at this moment, the maritime &s;trength of France (always &s;uperior to that of Denmark and Sweden, which has, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, been &s;ucce&s;s|ful) could command the re&s;pect of the world for her engagments. It is true, America neither was, nor is, in a &s;ituation to produce the &s;ame complai&s;ance; and, on the ground of that weakne&s;s, France has, hitherto, candidly di&s;pen&s;ed with a &s;trict performance of the treaty. But though America cannot <HI>enforce,</HI> &s;he ought not to <HI>aban|don</HI> her engagements: &s;he may &s;ubmit to imperious nece&s;&s;ity, but <HI>&s;he cannot voluntarily bring into que&s;tion</HI> the right of protecting, as a neutral power, the property of France; while France is not only ready and able to afford her property the &s;tipulated protection, but, in confor|mity to the &s;tipulation, actually <HI>allows the property of Great Britain to pa&s;s free, under the &s;anction of the American flag.</HI> When, there|fore, the treaty with Great Britain <HI>agrees,</HI> that within two years after the termination of the exi&s;ting war, <HI>it &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed</HI> "whether in any, and what ca&s;es, neutral ve&s;&s;els &s;hall protect enemies' property" &mdash;<HI>does it not cla&s;h with our previous promi&s;e to France, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods?</HI> And when the treaty with Great Britain, in formal and explicit terms, <HI>further agrees,</HI> "that in all ca&s;es where ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be captured or detained, on &s;u&s;picion of having on board enemies' property, &amp;c. <HI>the part which belongs to the enemy &s;hall be made prize"</HI>&mdash;Is not this <HI>an evident colli&s;ion with our previous agree|ment with France,</HI> and with the &s;ecurity which Briti&s;h property enjoys in con&s;equence of it? While France adheres to her treaty, by per|mitting
<PB N="19" REF="028527_0018_0FD934AF5B700088"><HI>Briti&s;h goods</HI> to be protected by American bottoms, is it ho|ne&s;t, honourable, or con&s;i&s;tent, on our part, <HI>to enter voluntarily into a compact with the enemies of France,</HI> for permitting them to take <HI>French goods</HI> our of our ve&s;&s;els? We may not be able <HI>to prevent,</HI> but ought we to <HI>agree</HI> to the proceeding? Let the que&s;tion be repeated &mdash;Does not &s;uch an <HI>expre&s;s agreement</HI> cla&s;h with our expre&s;s, as well as implied, obligations to France?</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) By enumerating, as contraband articles, in the treaty with Great Britain, certain articles which are declared free in the treaty with France, <HI>we may, con&s;i&s;tently with the latter, &s;upply Great Bri|tain; but, con&s;i&s;tently with the former, we cannot &s;upply France.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thus, <HI>our treaty with France</HI> (and, indeed, every treaty which we have) expre&s;sly declares, that, "in general, all provi&s;ions which &s;erve for the nouri&s;hment of mankind and &s;u&s;tenance of life; further|more, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, &s;ail cloths, anchors and any part of anchors, al&s;o &s;hips, ma&s;ts, planks, boards and beams of what trees &s;oever; and all other things proper either for building, or repairing &s;hips, and all other goods what|ever, which have not been worked into the form of any in&s;trument for war, by land or by &s;ea, <HI>&s;hall not be reputed contraband.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>The treaty with Great Britain</HI> expre&s;sly declares, "that timber for &s;hip building, tar or rozin, copper in &s;heets, &s;ails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may &s;erve directly to the equip|ment of ve&s;&s;els, unwrought iron, and fir planks only excepted, <HI>&s;hall be objects of confi&s;cation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy.</HI>"</P>
<P>Whether this &s;tipulation can be con&s;idered as founded on a prin|ciple of <HI>reciprocity,</HI> &s;ince the articles declared to be contraband are <HI>among our principal exports,</HI> but <HI>among the principal imports of Great Britain,</HI> might have been adverted to, in tracing a former feature of the treaty; but let it be now candidly an&s;wered, whether it is not <HI>in colli&s;ion</HI> with our previous engagements with France? The right to make &s;uch a &s;tipulation, is not, at pre&s;ent, controverted; but only the a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>exerci&s;ing the right does not cla&s;h in any degree</HI> with the terms and &s;pirit of the French treaty. France exempts tho&s;e important materials of our commerce from confi&s;cation, in fa|vour of all the world: Great Britain condemns them to confi&s;cation, whenever they &s;hall be carried to her enemies; and the compact is made, while France is one of her enemies!!</P>

<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> The Treaty with Great Britain is calculated to injure the United States, in the friend&s;hip and favour of other foreign nations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. That the friend&s;hip and favour of France will be affected by the formation of &s;o heterogeneous an alliance with her mo&s;t implacable enemy, cannot be doubted, if we rea&s;on upon any &s;cale applicable to the policy of nations, or the pa&s;&s;ions of man. From that republic, therefore, if not an explicit renunciation of all connection with the United States, we may at lea&s;t expect an alteration of conduct: and,
<PB N="20" REF="028527_0019_0FD934B048E12D98">finding the &s;ucce&s;s which has flowed from the ho&s;tile treatment that Great Britain has &s;hown toward us, &s;he may be, at length, tempted to endeavour at <HI>extorting from fear,</HI> what &s;he has not been able to obtain <HI>from affection.</HI> She will, probably, declare Great Britain in a &s;tate of blockade, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els in Europe; and &s;he may in&s;titute courts for "legal adjudication," in order to confi&s;|cate our ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t Indies. <HI>Great Britain will then chuckle at the &s;cene.</HI> No one can doubt that our embarra&s;ments will gratify, not only the avowed objects, but the latent re&s;entments, of that nation. Even if &s;he could obliterate the memory of our revolution, &s;he cannot, with plea&s;ure, behold the &s;ucce&s;sful experiment of a republican &s;y&s;tem of government; nor the rapid advances of a com|mercial competitor. The moment &s;he has produced a quarrel be|tween America and France, &s;he may exclaim, <HI>"Delenda e&s;t Car|thago."</HI> America is again a colony! How different were the inte|re&s;ts and di&s;po&s;itions of our tried friend! That our government &s;hould pre&s;erve its purity and independence&mdash;that our commerce and agri|culture &s;hould attain their zenith&mdash;were views <HI>once</HI> congenial with the policy and affections of the French nation: Heart, head, and hand, &s;he would have joined in promoting them, again&s;t the arts and enmities of all the re&s;t of the world! What a change, then, have we made!</P>
<Q><L>"Look on <HI>this</HI> picture, and on <HI>that:</HI></L>
<L>"The counterfeit pre&s;entment of two <HI>Allies!</HI></L>
<L>"Who would on this fair mountain leave to feed,</L>
<L>"To batten on that moor!"</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. During the war, we, likewi&s;e, formed a &s;ea&s;onable and &s;ervice|able treaty with the United Netherlands; and, &s;hortly after the war, treaties were e&s;tabli&s;hed with Swedenm Pru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c. But in order to avoir <HI>even the appearance of cla&s;hing or colli&s;ion</HI> with the French treaty, the powers, thus early in courting our alliance, were not allowed tho&s;e privileges of a&s;ylum for them&s;elves, and of excluding their enemies from our ports, which are conceded in the projected treaty to Great Britain. Have tho&s;e nations no cau&s;e for jealou&s;y and reproach? What principle of policy, or ju&s;tice, can vindicate the partiality and predilection, that has been thus &s;hown?</P>
<P N="3">3. But the projected treaty (after an affected recognition of pre|exi&s;ting public treaties) declares, that while Great Britain and America continue in amity, no future treaty &s;hall be made, incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the articles, that grant the high and dangerous privileges, that have been mentioned. Every nation of the earth (except France) is thus &s;acrificed to the pride and intere&s;t of Great Britain. And with what motive, or upon what con&s;ideration, is the &s;acrifice made? It has been &s;tated in a former, and will be more fully &s;hewn in a future, feature of Mr. Jay's treaty, that the United States do not enjoy any equivalent for this, nor for any other, conce&s;&s;ion which is made to Great Britain: But the mi&s;chief does not end with the folly of a lop-&s;ided bargain. By granting the&s;e exclu&s;ive privileges to Great Britain, by declaring that no commercial favour
<PB N="21" REF="028527_0020_0FD934B8E1EC7A90">&s;hall be conferred on other nations, without her participating in them, we have thrown away the fure&s;t means of purcha&s;ing, on any emer|gency, the good will and good offices of any other power: We cannot even improve the terms of our old treaty with France. For all the advantages of trade that Spain, Portugal, Holland, &amp;c. might, and probably would, upon a liberal footing of reciprocity, have given us,&mdash;what have we now left, to offer as the ba&s;is of ne|gociation and compact?</P>
<P N="4">4. The alteration which the treaty makes in the relative &s;ituation of &s;everal nations with America, and the conduct, that is likely to be pur&s;ued by tho&s;e nations, in order to counteract its effect, merit &s;erious reflection. Will Spain &s;ee without &s;ome &s;olicitude, the par|tition which we have made with Great Britain, of our territory on the ea&s;tern bank of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi? How would our projected treaty work, if France &s;hould recover Pondicherry, &amp;c. in the Ea&s;t Indies; &s;hould &s;ubdue and retain the We&s;t India i&s;lands; &s;hould &s;tipulate with Spain for the ce&s;&s;ion of Loui&s;iana; and &s;hould conquer Nova Scotia? The curious <HI>cordon</HI> with which we have allowed Great Britain to circumvent us (and of which more will be &s;aid hereafter) being thus broken, how are we to calculate the con&s;equences?</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;idering the Indians as a foreign nation, is not the treaty calculated to exalt the character of Great Britain, and to depreciate the character of America, throughout the &s;avage world? What right has Great Britain to negociate for Indians, within the limits of our juri&s;diction? Suppo&s;e the exi&s;ting we&s;tern po&s;ts &s;urrendered, may not Great Britain e&s;tabli&s;h other po&s;ts in a contiguous or more ad|vantageous &s;tation? Is &s;he not left at liberty to pur&s;ue the fur trade in our territory as well as her own? Will not her enterprize in traffic, &s;uperior capital and experience, enable her to monopolize that trade? And will &s;he not, in future, have the &s;ame motives, and the &s;ame means, to foment Indian ho&s;tilities, that have hitherto been indulged and employed, at the expen&s;e of &s;o much American blood and trea|&s;ure?</P>

<P N="1">1. If it is true, and incontrovertibly it is true, that the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of America, con&s;i&s;t (as our patriotic pre&s;ident, in his letter to Lord <HI>Buchan,</HI> declares) <Q>in being little heard of in the great world of politics; in having nothing to do in the political intrigues, or the &s;quabbles of European nations; but, on the contrary, in exchanging commodities, and living in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; and in doing ju&s;tice to, and in receiving it from, every power we are connected with;</Q> it is is likewi&s;e mani|fe&s;t, that all the wi&s;dom and energy of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter our government, &s;hould be con&s;tantly and &s;edulou&s;ly employed to pre&s;erve, or to attain, for the United States, that enviable rank among na|tions. To <HI>refrain from forming ha&s;ty and unequal alliances;</HI> to let
<PB N="22" REF="028527_0021_0FD934BAE70EAC28">commerce flow in its own natural channels; to afford every man, whether alien or citizen, a remedy for every wrong; and to re&s;i&s;t, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t appearance, every violation of our national rights and independence, are the means be&s;t adapted to the end which we con|template. It may be objected, that we are already involved in &s;ome alli|ances, that have had a tendency rather to de&s;troy our public tranquillity, than to promote our public intere&s;t. But a difference of circum&s;tan|ces will require and ju&s;tify a difference of conduct. For in&s;tance&mdash;it was nece&s;&s;ary and politic, in the &s;tate of our affairs at the commence|ment of the revolution, to pay a premium for the friend&s;hip and alli|ance of France: we could not have in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s without the co|operation of that nation: and as <HI>the price</HI> that we paid for it was not greater than <HI>the benefit</HI> that we derived from it, we cannot now, with ju&s;tice, cavil at our bargain. But was the inducement to form an al|liance with Great Britain, of a nature equally momentous? Is the advantage flowing from the &s;acrifices that are made, equally compen|&s;atory? Why &s;hould we, at this au&s;picious &s;ea&s;on of our affairs, ven|ture to undermine the fundamental maxim of our dome&s;tic happine&s;s, <HI>by wilfully obtruding on the great world of politics, or wantonly involv|ing our&s;elves in the political intrigues and the &s;quabbles of Europen na|tions?</HI> Suppo&s;e (as it is often alleged and &s;ometimes proved) that our treaty with France is productive of inconveniences; will it hap|pen in the political, any more than in the phy&s;ical or moral world, that by multiplying the &s;ources of evil, we &s;hall get rid of the evil it|&s;elf? If, according to the <HI>quondam</HI> opinion of the friends of a Briti&s;h alliance, our commerce has been re&s;trained in its operations; or if our government has been menaced in its peace and &s;tability, by a practical developement of <HI>the terms</HI> of our treaty with France, &s;hall we better our &s;ituation, becau&s;e we make <HI>another</HI> treaty <HI>upon the &s;ame terms</HI> with Great Britain; and furni&s;h <HI>two</HI> nations, in&s;tead of <HI>one,</HI> with an opportunity to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s us in pur&s;uing our natural and laudable policy&mdash;<HI>the policy of exchanging commodities, and living in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; doing ju&s;tice to, and in receiving it from, every power we are connected with!</HI></P>

<P>Are the <HI>intere&s;ts and happine&s;s</HI> of the United States involved in the permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment of a republican government?

<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t &s;triking effect of the treaty, <HI>to endanger the intere&s;ts, and di&s;turb the happine&s;s</HI> of the United States, may be detected by a geographical &s;ketch of the <HI>cordon, or line of circumvallation, with which it enables Great Britain to fetter and enclo&s;e us.</HI> The proximity of Canada and the we&s;tern po&s;ts, has heretofore been a cau&s;e of great unea&s;ine&s;s; but that is a trifling &s;ource of vexation, compared with what we &s;hall have in future to encounter.

<PB N="24" REF="028527_0023_0FD934BDC8A87610">juri&s;diction and occupancy. Has an American occa&s;ion to travel to the ea&s;t or the north? <HI>The barriers of Nova Scotia and Canada</HI> pre|&s;ent them&s;elves.

He is in hopes, however, to avoid all difficulty by a pa&s;&s;age on the ocean? Alas! our Atlantic harbours are crowded with prizes to Briti&s;h privateers, and our &s;ea coa&s;t is lined with Briti&s;h crui&s;ers!

In Europe, if, during a Briti&s;h war, he carries goods belonging to an enemy of Great Britain, they will be &s;eized as prize; if he takes &s;hip-timber, tar, rozin, &amp;c. they are liable to be confi&s;cated as contraband; and if his cargo con&s;i&s;ts of provi&s;ions, the Briti&s;h may take it, <HI>by treaty, at their own market price!</HI></P>
<P>One idea more about the boundary of the United States. Before the revolution, Great Britain had projected that general arrangement and divi&s;ion of her colonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America, which &s;he has &s;ince, upon a &s;maller &s;cale, carried into execution with re&s;pect to Ca|nada. The territory then intended to be allotted to the government of the Canadas, was extended by a line running along the northern boundaries of the ea&s;tern colonies, along the we&s;tern boundary of Penn&s;ylvania, and along the cour&s;es of the Ohio, into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. Since we are left at a lo&s;s for a po&s;itive definition of <HI>the precincts and juri&s;diction of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, as ceded by the treaty to the &s;ettlers un|der Briti&s;h titles,</HI> may we not conjecture, that Great Britain contem|plates the territorial extent of her original project? Does not major Campbell's unexpected preten&s;ion, and the con&s;tant claim of the In|dians, <HI>at the in&s;tigation of the Briti&s;h,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h the Ohio as a boun|dary between them and the United States, give &s;ome countenance to &s;uch a conjecture?</P>
<P N="4">4. But &s;hould an American, not &s;timulated by the de&s;ire of tra|velling into foreign countries, be content to pro&s;ecute the objects of his hone&s;t indu&s;try within the Briti&s;h territorial circle, bounding and con&s;tituting <HI>his own home,</HI> will his condition be much better than the condition of his itinerant fellow citizen? What with the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Briti&s;h colonies and Briti&s;h ware-hou&s;es; the naturalization of Briti&s;h land-holders; and, in &s;hort, the <HI>unqualified admi&s;&s;ion</HI> of Engli&s;hmen, owing allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown, throughout our lakes, rivers and territory, while we are <HI>excluded</HI> from their &s;ea-ports, company-lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. an American will hardly be able to find el|bow-room

<P N="5">5. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, <HI>the intere&s;t and happine&s;s</HI> of the United States mu&s;t langui&s;h and expire!

For, is not a great part of our trade, at this moment, monopoli&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, under <HI>the ma&s;k</HI> of American citizen&s;hip? Has not the influence of Briti&s;h credits, and Briti&s;h politics already formed a con&s;iderable party in our government, and among our merchants? Di&s;gui&s;e it as you will&mdash; let pride deny, and &s;hame &s;uppre&s;s the &s;entiment&mdash;&s;till, it is too evi|dent to every candid and di&s;cerning ob&s;erver, that the only &s;ub&s;i&s;ting difference in the opinions and conduct of the citizens of America, ari&s;es from this fatal cau&s;e. Why, at the moment of reprobating <HI>&s;elf-created &s;ocieties for civil purpo&s;es,</HI> do we gladly &s;ee the formation of <HI>&s;elf-created &s;ocieties for military purpo&s;es;</HI> the city cohorts and Prae|torian bands? Why are our merchants, who &s;o anxiou&s;ly called forth the voice of their fellow citizens in applauding the proclama|tion of neutrality, &s;o circum&s;pect and &s;o torpid in giving their te&s;ti|mony about the treaty? How comes it, that amid&s;t the acclama|tions of the 4th of July, the treaty is <HI>toa&s;ted</HI> in the little circle of Engli&s;h manufacturers, on the banks of the Pa&s;&s;ayik; and at the convivial tables of the Engli&s;h emigrants on the plains of the Ge|ne&s;ee? How comes it that every man who prefers France to Great Britain&mdash;republicani&s;m to monarchy,&mdash;is denominated <HI>Antifederali&s;t, Jacobin, Di&s;organi&s;er, Mi&s;creant,</HI> &amp;c. while men of another hu|mour arrogantly and exclu&s;ively a&s;&s;ume the titles of <HI>Federali&s;ts, Friends to order,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.? But let every hope&s;t American reflect &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ea&s;onably, upon the means of promoting <HI>the intere&s;t and happine&s;s</HI> of the United States, and he will di&s;dain, as well as dread, to augment, by the adventitious force of treaties, that paramount intere&s;t, which Great Britain has already in&s;idiou&s;ly acquired in our commerce, navigation, manufactures, territory, and government.</P>

6. Be&s;ides the injury eventually to be apprehended from the&s;e cau&s;es, the treaty is calculated to impair <HI>the intere&s;t and happine&s;s</HI> of the United States, by producing an immediate and violent concu&s;&s;ion in the federal atmo&s;phere. For,</P>

<HEAD><HI>VIII.</HI> The Briti&s;h Treaty and the Con&s;titution of the United States are at war with each other.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Self-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of &s;ociety, as well as of indivi|duals: It is the radical principle of all political compacts. Nations (&s;ays <HI>Vattel</HI>) are bound to guard <HI>their own pre&s;ervation, and to pur&s;ue their own perfection.</HI> We have ince&s;&s;ant opportunities, indeed, of ob&s;erving the operation of this univer&s;al rule; in animals of <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> as well as in animals of <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> in the world of <HI>things,</HI> as well as in the world of <HI>beings.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Self-pre&s;ervation, however, is a relative idea: it relates to the nature of the animal; to the con&s;titution of the &s;ociety. A man may lo&s;e his <HI>human character,</HI> without de&s;troying his <HI>vital exi&s;tence;</HI> and a government may be changed <HI>in its e&s;&s;ence,</HI> without being &s;ub|verted <HI>in its forms.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. So, likewi&s;e, without open a&s;&s;ault or po&s;itive violence, the &s;ources of animal life may be poi&s;oned, by the imperceptible conta|minations of a luxurious habit: &s;o, without the aid of terror or force, the legitimate foundations of government may be undermined, by the in&s;idious encroachment of the rulers, and by the &s;edative acquie&s;cence of the people. Governments, indeed, have too generally proved to be a kind of <HI>political chry&s;alis,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing, by progre&s;&s;ive tran&s;mutations, from the grub of pure democracy, to the butterfly of ab&s;olute mo|narchy.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="27" REF="028527_0026_0FD934C6D6963618">
4. But it will not <HI>yet</HI> be denied in America, that as the people have the &s;ole right to con&s;titute their government, the rule of <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> requires that the government &s;hould be maintained, in practice as well as in theory, <HI>&s;uch as they have con&s;tituted it.</HI> To render it, by any con&s;truction of the written articles of our &s;ocial compact, <HI>other than a republican government,</HI> would be as fatal a &s;ub|ver&s;ion, as daring u&s;urpation, or military conque&s;t, could atchieve. For, what real difference does it make to a nation, whether its con|&s;titution is <HI>&s;eized upon</HI> by an enterprizing individual, as in the Swe|di&s;h revolution of 1770; or <HI>overthrown</HI> by a triumphant warrior, as in the recent extinction of the Poli&s;h monarchy; or <HI>voted out of doors,</HI> as in the di&s;organizing edicts of the long parliament of England? Thus, likewi&s;e, for one department of the government to a&s;&s;ume the authority of another; or, by con&s;tructive amplifications of its own juri&s;diction, &s;o to monopolize the attributes of government, as to render the other departments u&s;ele&s;s and inefficient, mu&s;t ever be deemed an effectual &s;ubver&s;ion of any con&s;titution. The mode of di&s;tributing and organizing the powers of government, as well as the con&s;ideration of the nature and extent of the powers to be delegated, e&s;&s;entially belongs to the people; and in the body politic, as well as in the body natural, whenever any particular member ab&s;orbs more than its allotted portion of the aliment, that is de&s;tined to vivify and invigorate the whole, debility and di&s;ea&s;e will infallibly en&s;ure. Af|ter the emperors had u&s;urped the functions, privileges and powers of the &s;enate, and of the popular magi&s;trates of Rome, they pre&s;erved the formalities of the commonwealth, but they trampled on the liber|ties of the people. Though the parliaments of France had long been deprived of every deliberative faculty, as the repre&s;entatives of the people, they were &s;ummoned to the la&s;t, as the mini&s;terial officers of the monarch, for the purpo&s;e of regi&s;tering his edicts.</P>
<P N="5">5. The government of the United States, being then theoretically a <HI>republican government,</HI> and with great propriety denominated a <HI>go|vernment of departments,</HI> let us proceed to examine how far <HI>the prin|ciples of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> and the duty of <HI>pur&s;uing the perfection</HI> of our political &s;y&s;tem, are involved in the ratification of the projected treaty with Great Britain.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;econd article of the con&s;titution &s;ays, that, "The Pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the &s;e|nators pre&s;ent concur."</P>
<P>To the exerci&s;e of this power no immediate qualification, or re&s;triction, is attached: but mu&s;t we therefore &s;uppo&s;e that the juri&s;|diction of the Pre&s;ident and &s;enate, like the juri&s;diction a&s;cribed to the Briti&s;h parliament, is omnipotent? To place the authority of our Pre&s;ident and &s;enate on the &s;ame footing with the prerogative of the king of Great Britain, will not be commen&s;urate with the objects to which the treaty extends. It mu&s;t be remembered, that the treaty of peace, by which the rights of &s;overeignty and &s;oil were ceded by the king of Great Britain to the United States, was negociated
<PB N="28" REF="028527_0027_0FD934C85CA2A488">and ratified under the po&s;itive &s;anction of an act of parliament: And it is expre&s;sly &s;tated in <HI>Vattel,</HI> that the king of Great Britain cannot, by <HI>treaty,</HI> confer the rights of citizen&s;hip on an alien. B. 1. c. 19. &s;. 214. Now, Mr. Jay's treaty does both the&s;e things (as will be hereafter demon&s;trated) without the intervention of the legi&s;lative au|thority of the union.</P>
<P N="6">6. The con&s;equence of admitting this unqualified claim to omni|potence, in tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, would be &s;o ho&s;tile to the principle and pre&s;ervation of our government, that it is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty <HI>(ob&s;ia principiis)</HI> to controvert and re&s;i&s;t it. Whenever the Pre&s;ident and two-thirds of the Senate &s;hall be de&s;i|rous to counteract the conduct of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives; whenever they may wi&s;h to enforce a particular point of legi&s;lation; or whenever they &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to circum&s;cribe the power of a &s;ucceeding Congre&s;s; a treaty with a foreign nation, nay, a talk with a &s;avage tribe, affords the ready and effectual in&s;trument for accom|pli&s;hing their views; &s;ince the treaty or the talk will con&s;titute the &s;upreme law of the land. That <HI>&s;uch things may happen,</HI> let the hi&s;|tory of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion and negociation te&s;tify.</P>
<P N="7">7. If the extraordinary <HI>treaty-making power</HI> is paramount to the ordinary <HI>legi&s;lative power</HI>&mdash;&s;upercedes its exerci&s;e&mdash;and embraces all its objects; let us endeavour to trace whither the propo&s;ition will carry us.</P>
<P>The fifth article of the con&s;titution ve&s;ts a power in two-thirds of both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, to <HI>propo&s;e amendments to the con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that a defect in our judiciary, or in any other depart|ment, operated injuriou&s;ly to a foreign nation,&mdash;could the Senate, and Pre&s;ident, uniting with that foreign nation, and excluding the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives <HI>propo&s;e an amendment upon the &s;ubject?</HI> If they could by the&s;e means <HI>originate,</HI> might they not by other means <HI>effectuate,</HI> alterations in the fundamental points of our government; and make, in fact, a new con&s;titution for us?</P>
<P>By the eighth &s;ection of the fir&s;t article, <HI>Congre&s;s is</HI> empowered to <HI>borrow money</HI> on the credit of the United States.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e it was deemed expedient to &s;ub&s;idize Portugal, in&s;tead of building frigates, to keep the Algerines within the &s;treights of the Mediterranean:&mdash;Could two-thirds of the Senate and the Pre&s;ident, either borrow, or guarantee a loan for that purpo&s;e <HI>by treaty?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ection empowers <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h uniform laws on <HI>the &s;ubject of bankruptcies.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Great Britain had remarked, that, as her &s;ubjects were con&s;tantly the creditors of the citizens of the United States, &s;he was deeply intere&s;ted in our &s;y&s;tem of bankrupt laws:&mdash;Had the Pre&s;i|dent and two-thirds of the Senate, a right to incorporate &s;uch a &s;y&s;|tem with the projected treaty?</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ection empowers <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> to <HI>coin money,</HI> to regulate the value thereof, and of <HI>foreign coin,</HI> and fix the <HI>&s;tandards of weights and mea&s;ures.</HI></P>

Suppo&s;e the Birmingham manufacturers offered, on a cheap plan, to &s;upply us with coin?

<P>By the con&s;titution, <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> is endowed with the power of de|claring war.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e Lord Grenville had in&s;i&s;ted, and Mr. Jay had approved, that the treaty &s;hould be an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance; and, that we &s;hould forthwith join Great Britain in her ho&s;tilities again&s;t France:&mdash;Could the Pre&s;ident and Senate thus <HI>negociate</HI> us into a war?</P>
<P>By the con&s;titution it is declared, "that no per&s;on holding any office, &amp;c. under the United States, &s;hall, without the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s, accept of any pre&s;ent, emolument, office or title, of any kind what&s;oever, from any king, prince, or foreign &s;tate."</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e our envoy had been offered a pre&s;ent or a title by the Briti&s;h monarch&mdash;would the con&s;ent of the treaty be tantamount to the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of approving and ju&s;tifying his acceptance?</P>

8. But fatigued and di&s;gu&s;ted with di&s;playing, thus hypothetically the mon&s;trous con&s;equences, which will inevitably flow from <HI>the juri&s;diction claimed on behalf of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, to bind the United States by any treaty, and in all ca&s;es what&s;oever;</HI> let us parti|cularly examine <HI>the numerous and extravagant infractions</HI> of the con|&s;titution, <HI>which the projected treaty actually commits.</HI> Recent as is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the federal con&s;titution, it is, indeed, to be lamented, that the po&s;&s;ibility of violating it, is not a matter of floating and fluc|tuating popular opinion; but a matter &s;u&s;ceptible of fixed and po&s;i|tive proof. For, who does not recollect, that a bill touching the fundamental principle of the government (its repre&s;entative quality) <HI>after having pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, was declared by the Pre&s;i|dent to be uncon&s;titutional; and, therefore, unde&s;erving of his official approbation and &s;ignature?</HI> Who can forget, that a law touching the e&s;&s;ential properties of the judicial department of our government, <HI>after being ratified by every organ of legi&s;lative authority</HI> (the pre&s;ident, &s;enate, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives) <HI>was declared by chief ju&s;tice Jay, and his a&s;&s;ociate judges, to be uncon&s;titutional; and, therefore, incapable of being executed and enforced?</HI> With &s;uch authoritative precedents (and there are many others that might be adduced from the tran&s;|actions of individual &s;tates) of the po&s;&s;ibility of deviating from the rule and meaning of our con&s;titution, are we to be damned for poli|tical here&s;y, merely becau&s;e we doubt, or deny <HI>the infallibility of Mr. Jay's negociating talents?</HI> And mu&s;t every man be <HI>accur&s;ed</HI> (to u&s;e, for a moment, the intolerant language of the late &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, in his character of <HI>the New York Camillus</HI>) who thinks, that <HI>the American envoy and the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter were at lea&s;t as likely to mi&s;take, or mi&s;con&s;true, the con&s;titutional boundaries of the American government, as the pre&s;ident, &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the United States?</HI> It is certainly, upon the whole, more candid, and more covincing, to put "the defence" of the treaty upon the <HI>true trading ground,</HI> taken by the New York, chamber of commerce;&mdash; to wit,&mdash;<HI>"that we have made as good a market as &s;uch pedlars h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a right to expect on the royal exchange; and that we cannot afford to fight, though we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be plundered."</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Let us proceed, however, in examining the points on which <HI>the Briti&s;h treaty is at war with the American con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>By the con&s;titution of the United States, the JUDICIAL POWER</HI> is ve&s;ted in one &s;upreme court, and in &s;uch inferior courts as <HI>the Congre&s;s</HI> may from time to time e&s;tabli&s;h; and its juri&s;diction em|braces, among other things, <HI>"controver&s;ies between a &s;tate, or citi|zens thereof, and foreign &s;tates, citizens or &s;ubjects."</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the treaty, a tribunal other than the &s;upreme court, or any infe|rior court e&s;tabli&s;hed by Congre&s;s,</HI> is erected, with a juri&s;diction to a&s;certain the amount of any lo&s;&s;es or damages &s;u&s;tained "<HI>by divers Briti&s;h</HI> merchants and others, his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, <HI>on account of debts,</HI> &amp;c. that &s;till remain owing to them <HI>by citizens or inhobitents</HI> of the United States:" And it is agreed, "that in all &s;uch ca&s;es, where full compen&s;ation for &s;uch lo&s;&s;es and damages cannot, <HI>for
<PB N="31" REF="028527_0030_0FD934D68693D298">whatever rea&s;on,</HI> be actually had and received by the &s;aid creditors, in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, the United States will make full and complete compen&s;ation, for the &s;ame, to the creditors," &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Remarks.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is the right of every independent nation to e&s;ta|bli&s;h and maintain a judicial authority, co-exten&s;ive with its territo|rial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The principle is indi&s;putable, and it is incidentally recognized by Lord Mansfield and other great lawyers, in the cele|brated controver&s;y between the king of Pru&s;&s;ia and Great Britain, relative to the Sile&s;ia Loan.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The con&s;titutional tribunals of the United States were adequate to the admini&s;tration of complete ju&s;tice, in the very ca&s;es for which the treaty provides a &s;pecial tribunal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If it is po&s;&s;ible in any ca&s;e, with any nation, and at any time, to &s;ti|pulate, <HI>by treaty,</HI> for the erection of a tribunal, in order to a&s;certain and liquidate debts due from citizens to foreigners, may it not be done in every ca&s;e, with every nation, and at every time?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Is not the Court of Commi&s;&s;ioners, in effect, an High Court of Errors and Appeals for the United States with power to revi&s;e and rever&s;e every judgment, that has been given &s;ince the year 1783, <HI>either in a federal or &s;tate court,</HI> in every cau&s;e between a Briti&s;h &s;ubject and an Ameri|can citizen?</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Wherever the recovery of the principal debt has been protracted by <HI>the forms of law</HI>&mdash;wherever there has been <HI>an abatement in inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t,</HI> by the compromi&s;e of the parties, or the verdict of a jury&mdash; wherever <HI>the debtor has become in&s;olvent;</HI> this high court of Commi&s;&s;i|oners may &s;u&s;tain an appeal, and can award damages for the deten|tion or lo&s;s of the debt. It is true, the treaty adds, that this "provi|&s;ion is to extend to &s;uch lo&s;&s;es only as have been occa&s;ioned by <HI>lawful impediments;</HI>" but the <HI>extent</HI> of the di&s;cretion of the commi&s;&s;ioners, in adjudging what con&s;titutes a <HI>lawful</HI> impediment, is without limitation or controul; and the nature of the evidence, by which their minds are to be informed, is without rule or definition; &s;ince (in the language of the treaty) it may be "either according to the legal forms now re&s;pectively exi&s;ting in the two countries, or in &s;uch other manner as the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to require or allow." Thus, not only erecting a court un|known to our con&s;titution, but admitting a &s;pecies of proof, not re|cognized by the legal forms of our country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Let us appeal to Mr. Jay him&s;elf, upon the con&s;titutionality of &s;uch proceedings. By an act of Congre&s;s, the judges of the circuit courts were required to take, and report to the &s;ecretary at war, certain proofs in the ca&s;e of invalids and pen&s;ioners.

<P N="4">(4.) By the con&s;titution, Congre&s;s is empowered to regulate com|merce with the Indian tribes.</P>
<P>By the treaty, it is agreed, that "it &s;hall at all times be free to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &amp;c. and al&s;o to the Indians dwelling on either &s;ide of the boundary line of the United States, freely to pa&s;s and repa&s;s by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories and coun|tries of the two parties on the continent of America, &amp;c. and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other."

<PB N="34" REF="028527_0033_0FD934DBA6E40A18">will inevitably throw the whole fur-trade into the hands of the Briti&s;h.

Whenever a treaty of peace and amity has <HI>heretofore</HI> been concluded with the Indians, it has been the con&s;titutional practice of the Pre&s;ident, to call on Con|gre&s;s to regulate the commerce with them. Such calls were totally unnece&s;&s;ary, if the &s;ame thing might as well and as lawfully be done <HI>by treaty;</HI> and if it could not be done by treaty in the ca&s;e of the <HI>In|dians,</HI> neither could it be done by treaty in the ca&s;e of a <HI>foreign na|tion:</HI> For, both are expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>&s;ame terms,</HI> and included in the <HI>&s;ame member</HI> of the &s;ection. "Congre&s;s &s;hall have power (&s;ays the con&s;titution) to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and with the Indian tribes." What right is there by <HI>treaty</HI> to declare that <HI>no duty</HI> of entry &s;hall ever be levied by either party <HI>on peltries, &amp;c.</HI> (and a &s;imilar promi&s;e is made in ca&s;es that more immediately affect Great Britain) &s;ince <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> has the &s;ole power to lay and collect taxes, <HI>duties,</HI> &amp;c. to pay the debts, and pro|vide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States?

And then what becomes of that part of our con&s;ti|tution, which declares, "that all bills for rai&s;ing revenue &s;hall origi|nate in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives?" But let us imagine for a mo|ment, that it is in the power of the Pre&s;ident and Senate to regulate our commerce with the Indian tribes; <HI>ought not the regulation to be made with the Indians them&s;elves?</HI> Why &s;uffer Great Britain to nego|ciate and &s;tipulate for Indians actually re&s;iding within the territory of the United States? Is &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity and independence of our government&mdash;with the peace and intere&s;t of the nation? Let Mr. Randolph's letter to Mr. Hammond, on the conduct of general Simcoe and major Campbell be referred to, as an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. It is not, at pre&s;ent, within reach to be quoted; but its contents were too important to have already e&s;caped the memory of any reflecting American.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) By the con&s;titution, Congre&s;s is empowered "to define and puni&s;h piracies and felonies committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations."</P>
<P>By the treaty, the definition and puni&s;hment of certain offences, not known by any law of the union, is declared and permitted; to wit&mdash;1&s;t.

<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> To define crimes, and apportion puni&s;hments, is the peculiar province of the <HI>legi&s;lative authority</HI> of every free government: but it is obvious, from the foregoing recapitulation, that the <HI>executive authority</HI> has likewi&s;e encroached upon that province, by the in&s;tru|mentality of its <HI>treaty-making</HI> power.

It is not intended to convey the &s;lighte&s;t doubt of the power and pro+priety of controuling our citizens in their conduct towards <HI>foreign nations,</HI> while they are within the reach of <HI>dome&s;tic coercion:</HI> but to prohibit and American freeman from going whither he plea&s;es, in que&s;t of fortune and happine&s;s&mdash;to re&s;trict him from exerci&s;ing, <HI>in a foreign country, and in a foreign &s;ervice,</HI> his genius, talents and in|du&s;try; to denounce him for &s;eeking honour, emolument or in&s;truc|tion, by enli&s;ting <HI>within the territory, and under the banners</HI> of another nation&mdash;to do &s;uch things, is to condemn the principle of our own policy, by which we invite all the world to fill up the population of our country: To do &s;uch things is, in fact, to pro&s;trate the boa&s;ted rights of man. It is hardly worth a pau&s;e to a&s;k, What proportion of re&s;pect is due to the commi&s;&s;ion of a Briti&s;h officer? and what de|gree of puni&s;hment the refu&s;al or neglect to pay it, may de&s;erve?</P>
<P N="6">(6.) By the con&s;titution it is declared, that "no tax or duty &s;hall be laid <HI>on articles exported from any &s;tate.</HI>"</P>

<P><HI>Remarks.</HI> This is an extract, it is true, from the twelfth article of the treaty; but it equally &s;erves to &s;how the probability of attempts to violate the con&s;titution.

<PB N="36" REF="028527_0035_0FD934E4D09C7CB8">how far <HI>any modification</HI> of it could be rendered palatable. But, <HI>on con&s;titutional ground,</HI> when it is declared, that <HI>no duty</HI> &s;hall <HI>by law</HI> be laid on articles exported from any &s;tate, is it not ab&s;urd, or wicked to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>by treaty</HI> the exportation of <HI>the articles them&s;elves</HI> can be prohibited?

If a part of the United States may be ceded&mdash;if a whole &s;tate may be ceded, what becomes of the guarantee of a republican form of go|vernment to every &s;tate? The propriety of pre&s;enting this con&s;idera|tion to the public mind, will be allowed by tho&s;e who know, that, <HI>in the cour&s;e of the &s;enatorial debate, the</HI> right <HI>of</HI> ceding by treaty <HI>a</HI> whole <HI>&s;tate, nay,</HI> any number <HI>of the &s;tates, &s;hort of a majority, was</HI> boldly a&s;&s;erted, <HI>and</HI> &s;trenou&s;ly argued!!!</P>
<P N="8">(8.) It may not be ami&s;s, likewi&s;e, to add, that our government has no more right to <HI>alienate powers that are given,</HI> than it has to <HI>u&s;urp powers that are not given.</HI> For in&s;tance, <HI>an act of Congre&s;s</HI> could not (and can a treaty?) &s;urrender the right of &s;eque&s;tering the property of a ho&s;tile nation&mdash;the right of giving commercial prefer|ences to a friendly nation&mdash;and the right of &s;u&s;pending a ruinous in|tercour&s;e with any nation?

<P>But let the pardon of the reader be granted for <HI>this digre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and we will return to a delineation of the feature that lies before us.</P>
<P N="12">12. Declining, then, either to create, or to follow, a bad exam|ple, let us a&s;cribe the deviation from the principles of our con&s;titu|tion to an <HI>erroneous con&s;truction,</HI> rather than to <HI>a wilful perver&s;ion;</HI> and let us exert our &s;kill in averting the evil that threatens, rather than indulge our re&s;entment in convicting tho&s;e who labour to pro|duce it.</P>
<P>Our government, therefore, being <HI>a government of departments,</HI> it is (as we have already ob&s;erved) incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the duty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation;</HI> or, in other words, it mu&s;t proceed from an error in <HI>con&s;truction;</HI> that <HI>one</HI> department &s;hall a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e all, or any, of the powers, of all, or any, of the other departments.&mdash;"The departments or government (to adopt the elegant figure u&s;ed by an excellent judge, in a late admirable charge to a Philadelphia jury) are planets that revolve, each in its appropriate orbit, round the con&s;titution, as the &s;un of our political &s;y&s;tem." Thus, if the legi&s;lative, executive, or judicial departments &s;hall encroach, one upon the orbit of the other, the de&s;truction of the order, u&s;e, and beauty of the political &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t as inevitably en&s;ue, as the de|&s;truction of the order, u&s;e, and beauty of the planetary &s;y&s;tem would follow, from a &s;ubver&s;ion of the e&s;&s;ential principles of attraction, re|pul&s;ion and gravity.</P>
<P N="13">13. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the power of making treaties with foreign nations, &s;hould be ve&s;ted in one of the departments of the government: but the power of making treaties is not, in its na|ture, paramount to every other power; nor does the exerci&s;e of that power naturally demand an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction. A nation may car|ry on its <HI>external commerce</HI> without the aid of <HI>the treaty-making power;</HI> but it cannot manage its <HI>dome&s;tic concerns</HI> without the aid of the <HI>le|gi&s;lative power:</HI> the legi&s;lative power is, con&s;equently, of &s;uperior importance and rank to the treaty-making power. Again: <HI>The le|gi&s;lative power exerci&s;ed conformably to the con&s;titution,</HI> mu&s;t be direct, univer&s;al, and conclu&s;ive in its operation and force upon the people; but <HI>the treaty-making power</HI> is &s;carcely in any in&s;tance independent of legi&s;lative aid to effectuate its efforts, and to render its compacts obli|gatory on the nation. A memorable occurrence in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory will &s;erve to illu&s;trate both of the&s;e po&s;itions: It is the fate of <HI>the commercial part of the famous treaty of Utrecht,</HI> concluded be|tween France and England in the year 1712. "The peace (&s;ays Ru&s;&s;el in his Hi&s;tory of Modern Europe, vol. 4. p. 457) was gene|rally di&s;liked by the people, and all impartial men reprobated the treaty of commerce with France, as &s;oon as the terms were known. Exception was particularly taken again&s;t the 8th and 9th ar|ticles, importing "That Great Britain and France &s;hould mutually
<PB N="40" REF="028527_0039_0FD934F0C2D065E0">enjoy all the privileges in trading with each other, which either granted to the mo&s;t favoured nation; that all prohibitions &s;hould be removed, and no higher duties impo&s;ed on the French commodities, than on tho&s;e of any other people." The ruinous tendency of the&s;e articles was perceived by the whole trading part of the kingdom. It was accordingly urged, when a bill was brought into the hou&s;e of commons for confirming them, that the trade with Portugal, the mo&s;t beneficial of any, would be lo&s;t, &s;hould the duties on French and Portugue&s;e wines be made equal, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e and &s;imilar arguments induced the more moderate tories to join the whigs, <HI>and the bill was rejected by a majority of nine votes.</HI> In relating the &s;ame tran&s;action, Smollet's hi&s;tory of England, vol. 2. p. 242, 246, con|tains &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages too remarkable to be omitted on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion. "Again&s;t the 8th and 9th articles, (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial, declaring, that &s;hould the duties on French wines be lowered to the &s;ame level with tho&s;e that were laid on the wines of Portugal, his ma&s;ter would renew the prohibition of the woolen manufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed, all the trading part of the nation exclaimed again&s;t the treaty of commerce, which &s;eems to have been conclu|ded in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under&s;tood the nature of the &s;ubject. This precipitation was owing to the fears that their en|deavours after peace would mi&s;carry, from the intrigues of the whig faction, and the ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition of the confederates." "Ano|ther bill (continues the &s;ame writer, in a &s;ub&s;equent page) being brought into the hou&s;e of commons, for rendering the treaty of com|merce effectual, <HI>&s;uch a number of petitions were delivered again&s;t it,</HI> and &s;o many &s;olid arguments advanced by the merchants, who were ex|amined on the &s;ubject, that even a great number of tory members were convinced of the bad con&s;equence it would produce to trade, and voted again&s;t the mini&s;ter on this occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>Perhaps there cannot, in the annals of all the nations of the earth, be found two ca&s;es more parallel than the one which is thus recorded in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and the one which at pre&s;ent agitates the American nation.&mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. All impartial men reprobated both treaties, as &s;oon as the terms were known.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The admi&s;&s;ion of the oppo&s;ite contracting party to an unqualified participation in trade, with the mo&s;t favoured nation, is, in both ca&s;es, a principal &s;ource of com|plaint.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The removal of all prohibitions, and the &s;urrender of the right to impo&s;e higher duties on the commodities of the oppo&s;ite contracting party, than on tho&s;e of any other people, are, in both ca&s;es, condemned.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The good and the intelligent, of all parties, have united their influence, in both ca&s;es, to prevent a confirmation of articles of &s;o ruinous a tendency.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The whole nation, in both ca&s;es, have exclaimed again&s;t the treaty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Both treaties were concluded in a hurry, before the mini&s;ters fully under&s;tood the nature of the &s;ubject.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Innumerable petitions (and who will NOW deny the propriety of exerci&s;ing the American right to petition?) were delivered again&s;t both treaties.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. And the Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter
<PB N="41" REF="028527_0040_0FD934F2C27AD3A0">declared, in effect, of the treaty of Utrecht <HI>(mutatis mutandis)</HI> what the mini&s;ter of France will, probably declare of the treaty of London (but what America &s;urrenders the right of &s;aying at any time to Great Britain) "If you ratify your alliance with the Briti&s;h, you mu&s;t &s;urrender your alliance with France."</ITEM>
</LIST> If &s;uch a wonderful &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances concur <HI>in the negociation, terms, and recep|tion</HI> of the&s;e memorable in&s;truments, let us hope that the guardian angel of American liberty and pro&s;perity, has, al&s;o, doomed them finally to experience a <HI>merited &s;imilarity of fate!</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. But having thus &s;hown, that, <HI>even in Great Britain,</HI> the treaty-making prerogative is <HI>neither paramount nor exclu&s;ive</HI> (though <HI>the generality</HI> of judge Black&s;tone's expre&s;&s;ions on the &s;ubject, would, perhaps, lead to that prepo&s;terous conclu&s;ion) we might be &s;atisfied to pre&s;ume, on general principles, that &s;o high a claim of juri&s;diction could not be maintained, at lea&s;t, on the part of our pre&s;ident and &s;enate. Yet, let us endeavour, by the infallible te&s;t of the con&s;titu|tion, to put the matter, if po&s;&s;ible, beyond doubt and controver&s;y; and, having e&s;tabli&s;hed that each department of the government &s;hould be confined to its proper orbit, let us endeavour to a&s;certain, what that orbit is, in relation to the <HI>treaty-making power.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate to make treaties, is given, (as we have already &s;tated) <HI>in general and unre&s;tricted terms.</HI></P>
<P>But the powers given to Congre&s;s (except in an in&s;tance to be hereafter noticed) <HI>are definite in their terms, and appropriated in their objects.</HI></P>
<P>Let us a&s;k, then, by what rule of con&s;truction a power <HI>primarily and &s;pecifically</HI> given to one body, can be a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed by another, to which, <HI>in a &s;ub&s;equent clau&s;e,</HI> a mere <HI>general</HI> authority is given?</P>
<P>Upon the common law principles of con&s;truction, <HI>the &s;pecific powers</HI> would clearly, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be deemed a re&s;ervation and exception out of <HI>the general grant.</HI> But e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> according to a rule furni&s;hed by the con&s;titution it&s;elf, the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ult will be produced. Thus, the twelfth ratified amendment declares, "that the powers not delegated to the United States by the con&s;titution, are re&s;erved to the &s;tates re&s;pectively, or to the people." Now, if the general power granted for the purpo&s;e of making treaties, can &s;et at nought the juri&s;diction &s;pecifically given to Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e of mak|ing laws may it not, with equal propriety and effect, overleap the boundary thus interpo&s;ed between popular rights and con&s;tituted powers? In the one ca&s;e, the re&s;ervation is expre&s;sly declared&mdash;in the other, it is nece&s;&s;arily implied.</P>
<P N="2">(2. But if the delegation of a <HI>general power</HI> does, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> con|vey a right to embrace, in the exerci&s;e of that power, every authority not in compatible with its objects, the con&s;equence will be, that <HI>Con|gre&s;s may enter into treaties as well as the pre&s;ident and &s;enate.</HI></P>
<P>For, Congre&s;s is ve&s;ted with a juri&s;diction "to make all laws, which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution their
<PB N="42" REF="028527_0041_0FD934F8A7B79E28">own powers:" and what laws are, in that re&s;pect, nece&s;&s;ary and proper, they mu&s;t, from the nature of the thing, be the judge.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, therefore, that Congre&s;s was de&s;irous of forming <HI>an alli|ance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with France,</HI> but could not obtain the con&s;titutional number of two-thirds of the &s;enate for accompli&s;hing the mea&s;ure <HI>by treaty,&mdash;and act of Congre&s;s, in order to regulate commerce with that nation,</HI> would afford as effectual a mode (according to the new doctrine) &s;ince the act, on the pretext of an equivalent for com|mercial advantages, might <HI>legi&s;late</HI> us into the coveted alliance. The temptation and facility of proceeding in this way is obvious;&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ing of a law requiring but a majority of the &s;enate; whereas the ratification of a treaty requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of that body.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) It is not, however, nece&s;&s;ary to mingle and confu&s;e the de|partments of our government, contrary to the fir&s;t principles of a free republic; nor to make <HI>a part</HI> of our political &s;y&s;tem <HI>equal to the whole,</HI> contrary to the &s;ounde&s;t axioms of demon&s;trative philo&s;ophy, in order to give a ju&s;t, efficient and &s;alutary effect to the treaty|making power of the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. For although,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, the <HI>treaty-making</HI> power cannot bind the nation by <HI>a deci&s;ion</HI> upon any of the &s;ubjects, which the con&s;titution expre&s;sly devolves upon the <HI>legi&s;lative power:</HI></P>
<P>Yet, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, the treaty-making power may <HI>negociate conditionally,</HI> re&s;pecting the &s;ubjects that con&s;titutionally belong to <HI>the deci&s;ion of the legi&s;lative power;</HI></P>
<P>And, in the <HI>third</HI> place, <HI>every other &s;ubject,</HI> proper for the national compact of a republic, may be <HI>negociated and ab&s;olutely concluded by the treaty-making power.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) That &s;uch a di&s;tinction was intended by the framers of our pre&s;ent excellent con&s;titution, the rea&s;ons that have been glanced at, mu&s;t, it is thought, &s;ufficiently prove to every ingenuous mind: But let one argument more be adduced.</P>
<P>By the ninth article of the old confederation, it was declared, "That the United States, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall have <HI>the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right and power of determining on peace and war.</HI>"</P>
<P>By the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of the United States, it is provided, "That Congre&s;s &s;hall have power <HI>to declare war,</HI> grant letters of marque and repri&s;al," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, it is evident, that by omitting to depo&s;it <HI>with Congre&s;s</HI> the power of <HI>making peace,</HI> in addition to the power of <HI>declaring war,</HI> the framers of our pre&s;ent government, had in full view the divi&s;ion of its department, and the corre&s;ponding di&s;tribution of its powers.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, <HI>under the confederation</HI> was a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> body, and therefore, nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the little legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial authority, which <HI>the &s;tates</HI> had been plea&s;ed to delegate <HI>to the union.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The government of the United States,</HI> on the contrary, is a com|pound &s;y&s;tem, of which the Congre&s;s is only <HI>the legi&s;lative department:</HI> and, therefore, the executive and judicial functions are el&s;ewhere to be &s;ought for and exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="028527_0042_0FD934FD33714020">
Hence it is, that although the power of <HI>declaring war is</HI> (as it ought to be) <HI>left with Congre&s;s,</HI> the power of <HI>making peace is</HI> (as it ought to be) <HI>transferred to the executive;</HI> being a natural appendage of the general power of <HI>making treaties.</HI></P>
<P>This deduction &s;erves likewi&s;e to demon&s;trate, that the framers of the con&s;titution, did not intend to leave the powers that are <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> given to Congre&s;s, at the mercy of the power that is <HI>generally</HI> given to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate. By expre&s;&s;ing a po&s;itive juri&s;diction in favour of the former, it excludes a claim of juri&s;diction in favour of the latter.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Nor is it in <HI>the power of making treaties only,</HI> that the con&s;ti|tution has abridged <HI>the executi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> department</HI> of its cu&s;tomary attributes, in order to augment the &s;ources <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> legi&s;lative jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">diction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Great Britain</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;tance) <HI>the executive</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of making peace; of granting letters of marque and repri&s;al; of regulat|ing weights and mea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es; of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing money, regulating the value thereof, and of foreign coins; of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">recting courts of judicature; of conferring the rights of denizen&s;hip on aliens, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>In the United States</HI> the power for all tho&s;e purpo&s;es is ab&s;olutely ve&s;ted <HI>in the legi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. On reviewing the various po&s;itions that have been taken in the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;trictures, a de&s;ire is felt to exhibit the corrobo|rative opinions of men who have been ju&s;tly valued by the public: It will be u&s;eful to the reader, as well as plea&s;ing to the writer, to indulge the di&s;po&s;ition in a few in&s;tances, and in a brief manner.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It has been laid, that <HI>the power of regulating commerce belong|ed to Congre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The report of Mr. Ma&s;on (a member of the federal convention) on that &s;ubject, was delivered in the convention of virginia as fol|lows: "With re&s;pect to commerce and navigation, I will give you, to the be&s;t of my information, the hi&s;tory of that affair. This bu|&s;ine&s;s was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed [in the convention] at Philadelphia for four months; during which time the &s;ubject of commerce and navigation was often under con&s;ideration; and, I a&s;&s;ert, that eight out of twelve, for more than three months, voted for requiring two-thirds of the members pre&s;ent in each hou&s;e to pa&s;s commercial and navigation laws. True it is, that afterwards it was carried by a majority as it &s;tands. If I am right, there was a great majority for two-thirds of the &s;tates in this bu&s;ine&s;s, till a compromi&s;e took place between the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates; the northern &s;tates agreeing to the temporary importation of &s;laves; and the &s;outhern &s;tates conceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws &s;hould be on the footing in which they now &s;tand."</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It has been &s;aid, that <HI>the treaty-making power could not cede a part of the union, nor &s;urrender a citizen to be puni&s;hed as a pirate.</HI></P>
<P>The opinion of Mr. Randolph (a member of the federal conven|tion, and now &s;ecretary of &s;tate) delivered in the &s;ame convention, contains the following pa&s;&s;age: "I conceive, that neither the life,

<HEAD>Extract from the opinion of <HI>judges</HI> IREDELL and SITGRIAVES.</HEAD>
<P>"<HI>Fir&s;t:</HI> That the legi&s;lative, executive and judicial departments are each formed in a &s;eparate and independent manner; and that the ultimate ba&s;is of each is the con&s;titution only; within the limits of which each department can alone ju&s;tify any act of authority.</P>

<P>"<HI>Thirdly:</HI> That at the &s;ame time &s;uch courts cannot be warrant|ed, as we conceive, by virtue of that part of the con&s;titution dele|gating <HI>judicial power,</HI> for the exerci&s;e of which any act of the legi&s;la|ture is provided, in exerci&s;ing (even under the authority of another act) any power not in its nature judicial, or if judicial, <HI>not provided for upon the terms the con&s;titution requires.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Fourthly:</HI> That whatever doubts may be &s;ugge&s;ted, whether the power in que&s;tion is properly of a judicial nature, yet ina&s;much as the deci&s;ion of the court is not made final, but may be, at lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pended in its operation by the &s;ecretary at war, if he &s;hall have cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect impo&s;ition or mi&s;take, this &s;ubjects the deci&s;ion of the court to a mode of revi&s;ion which we con&s;ider to be unwarranted by the con&s;titution: For, though Congre&s;s may certainly e&s;tabli&s;h, in in&s;tances not yet provided for, courts of appellate juri&s;diction; yet, &s;uch courts mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of judges appointed in the manner the con&s;ti|tution requires, and holding their offices by no other tenure than that of their good behaviour; by which tenure the office of &s;ecretary at war is not held. And, we beg leave to add, with all due deference, that no deci&s;ion of any court of the United States can, under any circum&s;tances, in our opinion, agreeably to the con&s;titution, be liable to a rever&s;ion, or even &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, by the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be ve&s;ted, but the import|ant one relative to impeachments."</P>

<P>"It is a principle important to freedom, that in government, the <HI>judicial</HI> &s;hould be di&s;tinct from, and independent of, the legi&s;lative department.

SUCH. upon the whole, are <HI>"THE FEATURES OF MR.

If it &s;hall, in any degree &s;erve the purpo&s;es of truth, by leading, through the medium of a candid inve&s;tigation, <HI>to a fair, honourable, and patriotic deci&s;ion,</HI> the de&s;ign with which it was written will be completely accompli&s;hed, <HI>whether RATIFICATION or REJEC|TION is the re&s;ult.</HI></P>
<P>But, before the &s;ubject is clo&s;ed, let the citizens of the union be warned from too credulous an indulgence of <HI>their prejudices</HI> and <HI>their fears.</HI> The di&s;cordant cry of party is loud; and the phantoms of war a&s;&s;ail the imagination: yet, let us not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">deluded by &s;tratagem, nor vanqui&s;hed by terror. The que&s;tion is not a que&s;tion between party and party, but between nation and nation:&mdash;it is not a que&s;|tion of war or peace, between military powers; but a que&s;tion of policy and intere&s;t between commercial rivals. The &s;ubject is too momentous, to be treated as the foot-ball of contending factions;&mdash; it appeals from the pa&s;&s;ions to the judgment; from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s to the patrioti&s;m of every citizen!</P>

But, in the mean time, let a few &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions contribute to relieve the public mind, from the weight of that ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>di&s;po&s;ition of Great Britain,</HI> manife&s;ted by the order of the 6th of November, 1793, by the &s;peech of Lord Dorche&s;ter to the Indians, and by the repeated inva&s;ions made, under General Sim|coe's authority, upon our territory, <HI>is naturally ho&s;tile to the United States.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Even if the United States could, by any means, &s;oothe and con|vert that di&s;po&s;ition into amity and peace, <HI>the projected treaty is too high a price to pay for &s;uch a change.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The refu&s;al to enter into the projected treaty with Great Bri|tain, is <HI>not a ju&s;t cau&s;e of war;</HI> and if a <HI>pretence,</HI> only, is wanting, it may be found in the toa&s;ts at our fe&s;tivals, as well as in the acts of our government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. But the ratification of the treaty will a&s;&s;uredly give umbrage to <HI>another nation</HI>&mdash;to an ancient ally.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. If war is inevitable <HI>either with Great Britain, or with France,</HI> it would be more politic for the &s;tate, more congenial to the &s;enti|ments of the people, to engage the former, than the latter, power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. In ca&s;e of a war with Great Britain, we have a&s;&s;urance, <HI>that France will aid us with all the energy of her triumphant arms.</HI></ITEM>

<P>AMERICAN &s;hips from Europe enjoy a protecting duty of 10 per cent on the amount of duties on goods, wares, and merchandi&s;es, imported into the United States in foreign bottoms from Europe, and of 30 to 50 per cent. on teas imported in foreign bottoms from A&s;ia or Europe, paid by foreign bottoms, more than is paid on &s;uch goods imported in our own ve&s;&s;els.
