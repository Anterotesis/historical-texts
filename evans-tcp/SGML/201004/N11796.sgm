<P>YEARS are pa&s;t &s;ince fir&s;t you be&s;trid the hobbies &s;ilk and wine, which &s;eem to be in full career; and &s;orry I am to &s;ee &s;uch &s;peed, for aught that appears, without any previous con&s;iderati|on of the effects they may be attended with to the community, in an exten&s;ive view. I applaud the endeavours of your Philo&s;ophical Society, in general; but in this particular, wi&s;h &s;ome le&s;s mi&s;chievous ob|ject had flattered their attention. In a conver&s;ation at Bath, when I was la&s;t there, it was &s;aid they are excellent objects to employ our coloni&s;ts in; for, &s;ilk and wine will come to us from our plantations, upon much ea&s;ier terms than we now obtain them; and in a little time we &s;hall be able to &s;pare a part of them to the European Countries that at pre&s;ent &s;upply us. The plantations cannot &s;ell to any other than our|&s;elves;

</LETTER>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the readine&s;s with which the pro|jects for making wine and &s;ilk have been received by the numerous cla&s;s of wine drinkers, and fond ones for no|velty, I, though a wine drinker, have not yet been able to reconcile them to my poor judgment; however fa&s;hionable it may have been to embrace and promote them. On the contrary, &s;ome reflections in con&s;equence of the hints in the foregoing extract, have determined me, with a view to the public permanent happine&s;s, to declare my di&s;approbation of them.</P>
<P>It is a principle of &s;ound prudence, whenever in mat|ters of government, law and commerce, any material alteration is propo&s;ed, that you beware of latent con&s;e|quencies&mdash;be jealous of <HI>new</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;look forward, and con&s;ider how flattering &s;oever appearances are, what probably may be the mi&s;chievous tendency
<PB N="5" REF="014896_0004_0F973F527B7D0100">of &s;uch new <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"It is not ea&s;y to determine, upon theory, the &s;ucce&s;s of political innovations." PRINC. P. L.</NOTE> projects when adopted. It is often better to drudge on in a temperate and middle &s;tate, than to aim at too much.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ed cultivations are intended to introduce wine and &s;ilk as an American &s;taple; and &s;hould the at|tempt be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, their produce may, for a while, yield con&s;iderable profit to individuals; provi|ded the hand of power &s;hould not by impo&s;ts, or &s;ome other way, clogg and burden it. That there is at lea&s;t one other way, my friend has &s;hewn by the intimation, that our Engli&s;h brethren would tie us up from &s;elling to any but them&s;elves, as is actually the ca&s;e of tobac|co, and many other articles of American land produce, which are already heavily burthened with duties in En|gland. We have no a&s;&s;urance it would not be clogged; and if we had, it might become a que&s;tion how far tho&s;e who have recently committed repeated breaches of pub|lic faith, are entitled to our confidence, in a matter of &s;o great importance as the parting with what is e&s;&s;ential to our being.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and great e&s;&s;ential in life is <HI>bread.</HI> When|ever we &s;hall &s;urrender that&mdash;throw away the &s;ickle for the pruning knife and &s;ilk reel; for the making fine wines and fine &s;ilk materials for our ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, that they may more readily be&s;ot and bedeck them&s;elves; and in the end, through our pinching nece&s;&s;ities, which mu&s;t follow, govern us with a bit of bread, then may they tax at plea&s;ure and command like true mu&s;&s;elmen. We &s;hould have but little &s;pirits to claim, much le&s;s &s;upport con&s;titutional rights, and it would be as ridiculous to talk of them, as it would be for the meagre Spaniard or Ita|lian, who, with their bunnel and hu&s;ks of grapes, are ju&s;t enabled to drudge through a dark, dull, &s;lavi&s;h life.

<P>Being, from &s;uch a &s;urrender, reduced to want bread, how could our dejected minds contradict or di&s;obey the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive mandates of a Grand Vizier? I would &s;uppo&s;e that with our &s;ilk and wine we have, like the poor pea&s;ants of South Europe, made &s;ome bread: but our labour and attention being, by the artifices of tho&s;e called politicians (too often enemies to plain hone&s;ty and liberal &s;entiment) <HI>diverted,</HI> more e&s;pecially to the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing <HI>luxuries,</HI> which will neither &s;ufficient|ly feed or cloath us, we have, alas! only aimed at a &s;canty &s;tock of grain, barely for our re&s;pective country family's con&s;umption, and falling a little &s;hort in that, become mi&s;erably dependent on &s;trangers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Italy formerly exported corn; but afterwards became <HI>depend|ent on other countries for its daily bread:</HI> This is a&s;cribed by the Roman authors to the <HI>neglect of tillage.</HI>

<P>In the war immediately preceeding the la&s;t. France, in the mid&s;t of almo&s;t uninterrupted victories and con|que&s;ts, whil&s;t her labor and attention were much en|gaged by wine and &s;ilk, was compelled to make peace,

Ever &s;ince that &s;ore-felt &s;carcity, it has been her policy to encourage the making of corn, preferable to all other produce; &s;eeing and feeling, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, that however great or flouri&s;hing they may be in other re|&s;pects, <HI>bread being wanting &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t follow.</HI> This is an axiom applicable to individuals as well as to pro|vinces and kingdoms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>After the battle of Blenheim, the French army wanted large recruits, and there being a great &s;carcity of bread in the country, the French King ordered his public &s;tores of bread to be well taken care of.

<P>A celebrated author reckons it bad policy in the Eng|li&s;h to ob&s;truct the u&s;e of French wines: and would <HI>en|courage</HI> the French <HI>to turn their labor</HI> to the making more wines, by the free u&s;e of them in England; becau&s;e each new acre of vineyard planted in France, in order to &s;upply England with wine, would make it requi&s;ite for the French to take the produce of an Engli&s;h acre &s;own in wheat, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves: "and it is evident, that we have thereby got the command of the better commodity." Apply this to the <HI>lure</HI> now hung out to America<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hints and intimations were thrown out, from England, of immen&s;e riches to America, &s;hould &s;he employ her attention in making wine and &s;ilk. Such a &s;pirit as James I. attempted to in|fu&s;e in the minds of the Engli&s;h nation, was now to be caught by the Americans.&mdash;But they are employments equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the genius of this people as of that, and it is hoped that no|thing will lead this manly people into &s;o dangerous an employ|ment. Like their Engli&s;h ance&s;tors, they are too wi&s;e and con&s;i|derate to enter into &s;uch an effeminate ba&s;ine&s;s as &s;ilk making e&s;pecially.
<P>In the time of the &s;ame James of England, the &s;ilk rai&s;ed in France, yielded &s;uch an immen&s;e <HI>apparent</HI> profit, that our effe|minate King repeatedly recommended it from the throne, to rai&s;e Silk worms in England: But the nation was too prudent to be influenced to it by the Royal recommendation, although it was, perhaps, more earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by him and his &s;ervants than any other matter&mdash;even by the judges on the circuits, however fo|reign to their office: and there could be no doubt of the Silk|worm thriving and working as well in England as in other parts of Europe; as appeared by many experiments, be&s;ides what are recorded by the Philo&s;ophical Society, in their tran&s;actions. It was not many years ere that brilliant bu&s;ine&s;s began to decline greatly in France, where it is now quite trifling compared with its then va&s;t extent; for "the profit being <HI>little el&s;e than apparent,</HI> was not realized." Why did England reject the Royal &s;cheme, for making her rich?&mdash;It was again&s;t the genius of a free and manly people.&mdash;An employment fitted only to an effeminate and poor &s;pirited people. Hence we may ob&s;erve that, all the world over, the making of &s;ilk mo&s;tly flouri&s;hes among people of that &s;tamp, who are every where in a &s;tate of mi&s;erable oppre&s;&s;ion or &s;lavery. The very nature of the employment tends to enervate that hardine&s;s and vigour, which is the general effect of manly labour, and to effeminate the nation that unhappily &s;tumbles on it.</P></NOTE>. Why would our countrymen on the

Have we any rea&s;on to conclude, e&s;pecially from the pre&s;ent A&s;iatic temper of their ru|lers that there is in the project the lea&s;t regard for our welfare? Rather may we not &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>benevolent</HI> motive is pointed out above, by Mr. Hume; when, what he would that England &s;hould do by her implaca|ble enemy France, that &s;he would now do by us;&mdash;ca|jole us out of the <HI>command of the better commodity, nece&s;|&s;ary to our exi&s;tence,</HI> and make it requi&s;ite for us to take
<PB N="10" REF="014896_0009_0F973F5625E700C0">the product of <HI>her acres</HI> of WHEAT, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t our&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If from their exce&s;&s;ive luxury and their endle&s;s manufacto|ries, con&s;umers of bread among them, &s;hould be in too great proportion to their corn-makers, for the&s;e to &s;upply them and us al&s;o with wheat, yet the &s;ubjecting us to a dependence on them for bread, would be an&s;wered by foreign wheat, purcha&s;ed and &s;ent to us in their &s;hips, They have been u&s;ed to buy of us, to &s;end to foreigners; why not buy of other foreigners to &s;ell to us? They are not to be deterred by the price to be given, whil&s;t we mu&s;t buy of them at any rate.</NOTE>. He further &s;ays, there <Q>are many edicts of the French King, prohibiting the planting new vineyards, and ordering tho&s;e lately planted to be grubbed up; &s;o &s;en&s;ible are they of the <HI>&s;uperior value of corn above every other product.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid, I am &s;o extravagant as to contend we &s;hould be wholly employed in making corn, and no|thing el&s;e: it would be a de&s;ign too unnatural for any le|gi&s;lative authority to enforce. My meaning is, that we <HI>drop not, nor even relax from, the &s;taff of life:</HI>&mdash;that we &s;o far attend to rai&s;ing, within our&s;elves, a plenty of heart-cheering &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as to make luxuries and deli|cacies &s;ub&s;ervient to it; and not that any of the <HI>nece&s;&s;a|ries,</HI> our fir&s;t care, &s;hould depend <HI>on them.</HI> I am, too, for pre&s;erving the connection with Great-Britain. But it may be expected &s;he will allow us to be men who have rights; and having feelings, &s;uch as &s;he once had, that &s;he will forbear to play the tyrant over us Let Ame|rica, when her con&s;titutional freedom &s;hall be <HI>&s;ecured,</HI> &s;upport the true intere&s;ts of her parent: She is old, drinks hard, and her con&s;titution is much impaired; and having litigious neighbours, let us exert our&s;elves in her defence, not barely in proportion to her &s;ickly &s;tate, but to her ju&s;tice and public virtue; and let affection accom|pany it&mdash;when po&s;&s;ible! Let the commerce between us be &s;o regulated, that whil&s;t we render her raw materials
<PB N="11" REF="014896_0010_0F973F584C14D1B8">for her manufactories, &s;he grudge us not an independent &s;ecurity of our property, and &s;uch a &s;hare of foreign commerce as will enable us to pay for tho&s;e materials returned to us manufactured for u&s;e, burthened, as they would be, with the internal taxes of England, and with the high profits nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the luxurious living of Me&s;&s;ieurs the merchants, the mariners, gentlemen&mdash;trade&s;men, gentlemen &s;cavengers, and other gentle|men, down to the &s;hoe black&mdash;If this be denied to us, then it becomes not our choice but nece&s;&s;ity, to di&s;u&s;e her wrought-goods, and to manufacture the raw mate|rials for our nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions; further I hope we &s;hall not attempt. It is not the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of an infant country to engage in the manufacturing materials <HI>for ar|ticles of commerce.</HI> We want lands cleared and improved. The mo&s;t natural, mo&s;t advantageous article of trade, to us, is the produce of our farms; which ought of choice to con&s;i&s;t in nece&s;&s;aries; <HI>corn, cattle, wool, hemp, flax, &s;altpetre,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Let the&s;e, and &s;uch like, be our &s;taple of commerce; and let even the wool, hemp, and flax go in gro&s;s to England, &s;o long as &s;he will leave to us a trade el&s;ewhere open to enable us to buy her wrought wares. When this regulation, &s;o be|neficial to the Mother Country, is refu&s;ed, if we have been &s;o provident as to have made nece&s;&s;aries our &s;taple, we &s;hall have the comfort to find our hands full of ma|terials for our own nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption &mdash; I &s;hould &s;ay &s;alvation! with the&s;e we may be warm and robu&s;t, which with wine and &s;ilk alone we cannot. Here then is an advantage in choo&s;ing the "better commodities" for &s;taples of trade, in attempting to rai&s;e all we can, a &s;afe game is played: we have a moral certainty of our real wants being ever &s;upplied; and, generally, if not at all times, there will be a <HI>&s;urplu&s;age of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries to exchange with others for their delicacies and luxuries,</HI> whereby our imaginary or artificial wants would al&s;o be gratified.&mdash;Nor am I indifferent to a gla&s;s of good wine:
<PB N="12" REF="014896_0011_0F973F5B03C8B060">I admire, and am &s;eldom without it; but it is obtained in a way that America ought only to get it; by a com|merce and exchange of a <HI>&s;urplu&s;age of nece&s;&s;aries</HI> for that delicious juice.</P>
<P>Should I ever be without &s;uch &s;urplu&s;age, which has not yet been the ca&s;e (for my ground yields abundant corn!) then I &s;hall only mi&s;s of, for a time, what I can always do without. Nor yet do I carry my objections &s;o far, but that tho&s;e gentlemen who have the opportunity, may proceed in wine-making, for amu&s;ement or for fa|mily u&s;e: and even, &s;hould the humour &s;o run, for ge|neral internal con&s;umption: though, perhaps, it were better not carried &s;o far as this, for fear we &s;hould reach to exportation.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion has been repeatedly a&s;ked: "would you have every body make grain?" I have declared it cannot be; a law to that purpo&s;e would be as ridicu|lous as incon&s;i&s;tent with the various di&s;po&s;itions and hu|mours of men. And yet too much cannot be made. Mountains of grain would invite a market. But hu&s;bandmen will in the&s;e ca&s;es ever choo&s;e for them|&s;elves; all that I &s;ay is, let not our provincial legi&s;lators, or men of influence, mi&s;lead the people, by encourage|ments of any &s;ort, to labour in making for the principle commodities, articles of luxury; but rather di&s;&s;uade them from it: and let the fat farmer be on his guard, nor part with his &s;taff, "the better commodity" for vines and worms<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is not thirty years &s;ince wheat fir&s;t became a con&s;iderable object of exportation, in Maryland; nor twenty &s;ince Virginia fir&s;t attended to it. Before the&s;e times, acts of a&s;&s;embly were not unfrequent for prohibiting exportation of corn, from the &s;carcity of it to an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ary wants of the country; and &s;o incon&s;i|derable was the quantity of wheat, and it was &s;o unu&s;ual to ex|port it, that the prohibitory acts chiefly affected indian corn;&mdash;&s;carcely touching wheat. The people of the&s;e countries were then poor and &s;piritle&s;s to what they now are. Tobacco and indian corn, engro&s;&s;ed the planters whole attention. Of tobacco, they con&s;tantly aimed at making all they could; all Dung was for to|bacco ground;&mdash;not a &s;crap for gra&s;s or grain; their cattle in|deed were numerous; but being u&s;ually hide-bound for want of food, made not <HI>much</HI> dung: They were apt to take an ugly di&s;or|der in the &s;pring of the year;&mdash;they could not eat,&mdash;could not chew the cud&mdash;for want of food,&mdash;they died. Of corn the plant|ers aimed at making but little or no more than might &s;uffice them&s;elves, their Negroes and bea&s;ts: more would interfere with the quantity of tobacco.&mdash;So would wheat interfere with wine, and wine with wheat. What of their corn they had to &s;pare&mdash;it was but &s;ometimes, and &s;eldom much, was purcha&s;ed with a little rum:&mdash;The tobacco, by Engli&s;h or Scotch &s;tores of dry goods; or it was &s;hipt in driblets, to London, on con&s;ignment, the planters receiving returns according to the cunning of their factors there. But &s;o much was &s;old in the country to tho&s;e &s;tores, or rather bartered for family nece&s;&s;aries, and too often for luxuries, that many planters, at the end of the year, had nothing they could call their own, except their lands and uten&s;ils of hu&s;bandry; and not always the&s;e. They were &s;trictly delvers,&mdash;planters for Britain;&mdash;always in debt, year over year;&mdash;begging indulgence,&mdash;cringing for more credit, and humbling them&s;elves before foreign factors, and their boys;&mdash;who being birds of pa&s;&s;age had no feelings for the intere&s;ts of the country&mdash;they rather poi&s;oned the minds of the planters from behind their counters, with principles and opi|nions inimical to American rights and the planters own intere&s;ts, in favour of that people&mdash;that paliament&mdash;which was to &s;econd the views of tho&s;e very factors and the Briti&s;h merchants as often as they &s;hould call for aid, to facilitate their de&s;igned advantages over the planters&mdash;"our planters"&mdash;as they call the Americans. It was a &s;triking in&s;tance of wheat being the "better commodity," that, as the cultivation of it advanced among us, the demand, and of cour&s;e the price, increa&s;ed: and whil&s;t, by its means, the upper counties of Maryland were enjoying plenty, and a chear|ful independence, being emancipated from the tobacco &s;tores, the lower counties, &s;till continued for years, the cringing mortgagers to Briti&s;h merchants; and, perhaps, are not quite clear of them, in &s;ome counties, at this day. Thus, as the progre&s;s of wheat making travelled &s;outhward, the people became daily more im|proved in their &s;entiments, manner of life, and independency. Between tobacco and hemp&mdash;how great the contra&s;t! Tobacco, a <HI>luxury.</HI> hemp, a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> in univer&s;al demand! It is in the&s;e, and in every &s;en&s;e the planter and politician can examine it, "the bet|ter commodity."&mdash;for private, and for public advantage!</NOTE>.</P>

It is &s;aid that &s;ilk would be mo&s;tly womens work. 'Tis true; but, if our wives and daughters were to rai&s;e as
<PB N="14" REF="014896_0013_0F973F5CECBE3940">much &s;ilk as would, from its high price, purcha&s;e a plenty of cloathing and food, the men, after a while, would un|doubtedly become idle and indifferent to any other pro|duce; our lands would be but little, if at all, cultivated and improved and the women performing, within a few weeks, the bu&s;ine&s;s of rai&s;ing worms, would become equaly lazy and worthle&s;s for the re&s;t of the year;&mdash;and, by degrees, both men and women would be ignorant of hu&s;bandry and hou&s;ewifery. Nor could their &s;ilk more readily purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries and all we &s;hould want, than money would. Suppo&s;e then mountains of guineas open to all the people of this country with which they &s;hould <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> what at pre&s;ent they labour in the fields to make: Can any be at a lo&s;s to conceive the wretched|ne&s;s and dependency in which a country of people, &s;o circum&s;tanced, would pre&s;ently be plunged! how to|tally ignorant the next generation, of agriculture, com|merce, and the arts. "The riches and &s;afety of a country con&s;i&s;t not alone in the number of its inhabitants, but of tho&s;e <HI>well employed.</HI>" Look to Spain &mdash; to New Spain and its rich mines;&mdash;&s;ee the crawling ignorant Spaniard!&mdash;our oppre&s;&s;ed, nece&s;&s;itous, and unhappy neighbours!</P>
<P>It it probable, that in another century, &s;ilk, with other fine materials, and even manufactured goods, will be articles of commerce, from the mountaineers, back of Carolina, and other places, far from navigation, and not bulky, cheap and heavy articles, becau&s;e of a long
<PB N="15" REF="014896_0014_0F973F5DB3B35230">land carriage; whil&s;t all heavy, gro&s;s, and cheap articles; will be from the countries mo&s;t convenient to navigation: of which corn is one, as being too heavy for its price, to bear a very di&s;tant land carriage. Let us then, for as yet we have little el&s;e improved than the maritime coun|try, retain our bulky produce of <HI>nece&s;&s;aries,</HI> for the &s;ta|ple of commerce. The more bulky, the better for the country exporting it; becau&s;e it employs more labour and &s;hipping; Wheat is therefore better than &s;ilk, as well as for the before mentioned rea&s;ons. Tobacco (although a luxury by the bye) is better than the luxury furr,&mdash;rice better than indigo.</P>
<P>Perhaps the chief export produce of the maritime country between Connecticut and James river, will be wheat and flour;&mdash;of the Carolinas, Georgia and the Floridas, rice;&mdash;Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts, and other parts of New-England, fi&s;h, cattle, and hor&s;es;&mdash;the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, lum|ber, iron, and hemp&mdash;in &s;hips built there.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ucce&s;s of the pre&s;ent de&s;ign of rai&s;ing &s;ilk, I am not without hope, it will fail in Penn&s;ylvania, as it has in Carolina and Georgia, notwith&s;tanding the in|du&s;try u&s;ed to induce the country people to bend their attention to it. The Carolinas went heartily to work to enrich them&s;elves, <HI>in a hurry</HI> by making &s;ilk; but in fourteen years they exported only 251lb. of raw &s;ilk; and in the &s;ame time imported the extravagant quantity of 26781lb. wrought for apparel. This I take from a &s;tate of Carolina publi&s;hed in London, in 1761, which &s;eems to be the production of a Governor of that colo|ny. I hope the following reflection of his will not be di&s;|agreeable, although &s;omewhat foreign: <Q>I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize and concern, to find that there are annually imported into this province, con&s;idera|ble quantities of Flanders lace, the fine&s;t Dutch linens and French Cambricks, chintzes, hy&s;on tea, and
<PB N="16" REF="014896_0015_0F973F5E68550708">other goods, &s;ilk, gold and &s;ilver lace, &amp;c. by which means we are kept in low circum&s;tances, and though it may have the appearance of being for the pre&s;ent, beneficial to the Briti&s;h merchants, yet it retards our increa&s;e, both in people and wealth, and con&s;equent|ly renders us le&s;s profitable to Great-Britain; for the riches of all colonies, mu&s;t at length center in the mo|ther-country.</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;aid, in all countries there are &s;pots of land too poor for any other cultivation than the vine:&mdash;and that it is the ca&s;e in the colonies: I can only declare. I know of no &s;uch &s;oil in our America I affirm, there is no &s;oil &s;uitable to the vine, that will not produce &s;ome other <HI>more nece&s;&s;ary</HI> plant. You have heard of this and that i&s;land, or part of &s;ome country, poor and rocky, producing delicious wine:&mdash;they are wine coun|tries;&mdash;countries, where that culture has been in|troduced by de&s;potic influence, and is rivited on the backs of the mi&s;erable inhabitants:&mdash;<HI>they want bread.</HI> There are other countries equally portion|ed with rocks and poverty of &s;oil, in as good climates:&mdash;the&s;e produce no delicious wine&mdash;no wine at all, or none for exportation, but they yield the nece&s;&s;aries of life in greater abundance; <HI>they have bread!</HI> and enjoy &s;ome freedom&mdash;con&s;olation at lea&s;t The truth is, where, of lands very poor and rocky, you cannot cultivate a|bove one acre; of better, clear of rocks, you can cul|tivate an hundred acres, or more; in this you &s;ow fields of grain; in the other you are confined from &s;owing grain, &s;ufficient even for your little family's con&s;ump|tion. You then look for a plant that will yield much of &s;omething from little land:&mdash;this &s;omething in your country, has hitherto, u&s;ually been the grape. But the vine requires manure: it will not an&s;wer without it; and your acre of grapes requires as much labor and attention as the hundred acres of corn. If poor land is the be&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="014896_0016_0F973F5F263EAA28">for the vine, it is &s;o only with the addition of good ma|nure and the highe&s;t cultivation. Cultivate the poore&s;t ground equally well, and look about for &s;ome plant of more nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e:&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e hemp, flax, gra&s;s, cot|ton, &amp;c. But why hazard the happine&s;s and independen|cy of the country, by introducing the vine culture, in order, niggardly, to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of a few acres of the very poore&s;t land, when a va&s;t continent teems with better!&mdash;Thou&s;ands&mdash;millions of poor land lay wa&s;te and uncultivated in the be&s;t countries of Europe, and of all the world; and in the le&s;s happier countries, millions of acres, better and more improveable, are equally ne|glected.&mdash;If, &s;till, you are determined to cultivate the grape, for making wine, you will choo&s;e the land be&s;t a|dapted for it:&mdash;if the poore&s;t is the be&s;t then cultivate it. But why wine? You want to be employed:&mdash;go then, to <HI>better lands;</HI>&mdash;there &s;eek the <HI>"better commodity"</HI>&mdash;in the <HI>better employment!</HI> and take example by the &s;ufferings of a great nation!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">France, as well as other countries. See before.</NOTE> Your ta&s;te&mdash;teazes you to attempt the making wine:&mdash;indulge it!&mdash;But, as you will an&s;wer it to the nece&s;&s;itous hu&s;bandmen, hereafter, lead not one mortal to delve in &s;uch barren &s;oil, in an employment only tending to bronze the voluptuous at their expence. Rather encourage them to avoid your ta&s;te and be happy at home, admi&s;t a "plenty of whol&s;ome food and decent cloathing," with their placid wives and ro&s;y children, manufactoring all nece&s;&s;aries, <HI>under a depre&s;&s;ed trade,</HI> within them&s;elves&mdash;&s;paring to foreign countries the &s;ur|plu&s;age of their GRAIN, their WOOL and HIMP;&mdash;BEST COMMODITIES!&mdash;ESSENTIALS OF DOMESTICK AND NATIONAL FELICITY!</P>

<P><HI>WHEN</HI> the country, &s;ix or &s;even years &s;ince, was an|xious to introduce the culture of Wine and Silk, the Writer of the preceeding pages did no more than now and then, in conver&s;ation, drop a hint of his apprehen&s;ions of the mi&s;chievous tendency of &s;uch culture. But under an illne&s;s, whil&s;t confined to his room, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;crib|bling off his &s;entiments nearly as they now appear. He &s;hew|ed them to two or three friends, who thought them to be too much again&s;t the &s;pur of the day to be attended to. The piece was then thrown a&s;ide, and lay un&s;een from that time, until lately that he &s;hewed it to &s;everal Gentlemen, who thought it ought to be publi&s;hed: But he determined to print only a few copies for Gentlemen, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be better judges of the &s;ubject and the expediency of publi&s;hing at large &s;uch &s;entiments, than the generality of readers are.</P>
