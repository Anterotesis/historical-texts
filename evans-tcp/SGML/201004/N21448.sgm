<P>THE favorable reception which the Fir&s;t Book of ARISTOCRACY has met with from an indulgent Public, encourages the Editor to proceed in the Publication; and, agreeable to his engagement, to pre&s;ent the Second Book to the notice of his Fellow-Citizens. As he ex|pected, various judgments have appeared re&s;pect|ing the Work; but he is happy to ob&s;erve that all have not mi&s;apprehended him. While he ac|knowledges, with gratitude, his obligations to &s;ome, who have been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s them|&s;elves favorably of his principles and de&s;ign, he thinks it his duty to declare that he has been gro&s;sly mi&s;conceived by others: and he further e&s;teems it incumbent upon him to make known his determination not to be deterred from the ex|erci&s;e of, what he con&s;iders, an inalienable right, by the threatened, or actual, interference of any man; how highly &s;oever he may rank in the good opinion of a certain de&s;cription of Ame|ricans.</P>

<HEAD>ARISTOCRACY. BOOK SECOND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WASH'D by the tempe&s;t of the gloomy night,</L>
<L>Mild ro&s;e the morn, in blu&s;hing beauty bright.</L>
<L>Cheerful the hinds awake, from &s;hort repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Cheerful the city's bu&s;y &s;warms aro&s;e.</L>
<L>But, on his couch, to troublous dreams a prey,</L>
<L>In interrupted &s;leep, ARISTUS lay.</L>
<L>Vainly he langui&s;h'd for refre&s;hing re&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>Unkind de&s;erter of the anxious brea&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>And vainly &s;trove in Lethean dews to &s;teep</L>
<L>Th'increa&s;ing woes of his perturbed &s;leep;</L>
<L>When now, from SATAN &s;ent, a bolder dream,</L>
<L>On quivering wings, with ampler me&s;&s;age came;</L>
<L>And, lightly hovering o'er th'uncon&s;cious Sage,</L>
<L>Bade vi&s;ionary &s;cenes his mind engage.</L>
<L>ARISTUS &s;aw&mdash;when lo! before his eyes,</L>
<L>A &s;tately dome maje&s;tic &s;eem'd to ri&s;e:</L>
<L>Wide opes the portal, wide the hall expands,</L>
<L>And, full in view, a &s;umptuous banquet &s;tands.</L>
<L>Around, of various ages, different tongues,</L>
<L>From many doors, ru&s;h in the num'rous throngs;</L>
<L>And, with obei&s;ance low, and &s;tudied phra&s;e,</L>
<L>Of endle&s;s gratitude, and pompous prai&s;e,</L>
<L>To one, unknown, aloft, to view di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>The gathering crowd their uncouth homage paid.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="028172_0004_0FD7354E23967170">
A&s;toni&s;h'd at a &s;cene &s;o &s;trange, the Chief</L>
<L>Dar'd not withhold, yet &s;carce could grant belief;</L>
<L>And round him look'd, with anxious doubts oppre&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>When thus the MAN unknown the Chief addre&s;t.</L>
<L>"Why &s;tands ARISTUS wrapt in mute &s;u&s;pence?</L>
<L>"Why bears he &s;till this lethargy of &s;en&s;e?</L>
<L>"Rou&s;e thee ARISTUS! bur&s;t thy &s;lothful bands!</L>
<L>"Thy genius a&s;ks it, and the time demands.</L>

<L>The Vi&s;ion vani&s;ht, and the Hero 'woke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when an army, far from friendly aid,</L>
<L>Retiring, flee the land they dar'd invade;</L>
<L>And, night &s;ucceeding night, a &s;hort repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Prone on his arms, is all the warrior knows;</L>
<L>What time the morning ca&s;ts a doubtful gleam,</L>
<L>Hear &s;udden bur&s;t the foe's revengeful &s;cream;</L>
<L>The loud drums beat, &s;onorous trumpets &s;ound;</L>
<L>Rude cla&s;h of arms, and hor&s;es &s;hake the ground;</L>
<L>Start from deluding &s;leep, and ru&s;h to war&mdash;</L>
<L>So, from his couch, ARISTUS &s;prang&mdash;with fear.</L>
<L>What could the portent mean? In deep amaze,</L>
<L>He turns it in his mind a thou&s;and ways;</L>
<L>Doubt after doubt di&s;turbs his labouring brain;</L>
<L>And all his long conjectures prove in vain.</L>
<L>At length, joy-&s;tricken, and with glad &s;urprize,</L>
<L>"Can it be &s;o?" the enraptur'd hero cries&mdash;</L>
<L>"O if it be, in nature's ample round,</L>
<L>"Ble&s;t as ARISTUS, can there one be found?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had he ended, when the door expands,</L>
<L>And in his pre&s;ence faithful Janus &s;tands.</L>
