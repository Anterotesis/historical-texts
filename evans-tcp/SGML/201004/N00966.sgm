For all good Divines, as well as good Philo&s;o|phers, hold. That all Creatores are e&s;&s;entially &s;ubordinated to God Almighty in their Beings and Actions, and yet he is not that Author of their &s;inful Actions. And if Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own the e&s;&s;ential Subordination of Creatures to Almighty God, but only by accident and contingently &s;ubordinated, it is a great Error; for it impugnes the great dependency that all Creatures have upon God Almighty, and renders the Creatures a &s;ort of Independents one way, as Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> him&s;elf is another way. But, if Creatures be only by accident and contingently &s;ubordi|nated to God, then it may happen, that they may act without any dependence on him, and con&s;equently they may act without any Determination of God, &s;o as nece&s;&s;arily to produce any &s;in|ful Action. But though the affirming of the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Subordi|nation</HI> of Creatures to God Almighty, doth not infer his deter|mining them nece&s;&s;arily to produce &s;inful actions, yet the denyal of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential Subordination of Creatures to God in their Actions, will plainly infer, that they are not under the acce&s;&s;ity of any Determination to &s;inful Actions.</P>
<P>Again, the above&s;aid Maxim holds good in Cau&s;es not e&s;&s;en|tially &s;ubordinated, as when the Devil tempted <HI>Eve</HI> to &s;in, and <HI>Eve</HI> tempted <HI>Adam,</HI> both the <HI>Devil</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were moral cau&s;es of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in, and both culpable; and yet neither was <HI>Adam</HI> e&s;&s;entially &s;ubordinated to <HI>Eve,</HI> nor <HI>Eve</HI> to the <HI>Devil;</HI> nor was there any Subordination in the ca&s;e at all, of our fir&s;t Parents to the Devil, in their primitive &s;tate of Creation.</P>

<P>Pag. 30 His fourth Medium is from <HI>the Divine Prediction of future things, which,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>is an evidence of the certain futurity of them.

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That all the Works of God are wrought by him, after the Coun&s;el of his own Will, is granted; but that the &s;ins and evil that Men or Devils work, are the work of God, or to be attributed to him, as to their proper Cau&s;e, is denyed; for then he would be the Author of them; for of whatever Work any Agent is the proper Cau&s;e, of the &s;ame he is the Author.

Again, &s;ome are Actions proceeding from Sub&s;tances, as their proper Cau&s;e, &s;ome whereof are nece&s;&s;ary Agents, and not free, as the actions of Bea&s;ts, Fowles and Fi&s;hes; others are free, as the Actions of Men. Now to an&s;wer directly to his Que&s;tion, The Futurity of all created Sub&s;tances, is entirely from God, both from his Power and Will, and al&s;o from his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. And the Futurity of the Actions of nece&s;&s;ary Agents, is from the Futurity of the Agents them&s;elves. And the Futurity of the Actions of free-Agents, that are &s;inful (or generally indifferent) is from the Futurity of the free Agents them&s;elves, &s;uch as Men and Angels are; for as the Branches, Leaves and Fruit of a Tree lie hidden in the Seed or Root of it, &s;o all Actions, whether of nece&s;&s;ary or of free Agents, lie in the Agents them&s;elves, as in their Seeds and Roots or Principles, before they be brought forth into act or effect. And as it doth not &s;urpa&s;s Mans knowledge to know what Actions will proceed from nece&s;&s;ary Agents, and that by certain knowledge, in great part, &s;o nor doth it &s;urpa&s;s Gods knowledge, to know mo&s;t certainly and infallibly what Actions will proceed from free Agents, &s;uch as Men and Angels, for this far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing knowledge, or fore knowledge of God concern|ing the actions of free Agents, mu&s;t needs be granted to God,

<P>FRom pag. 32. to pag. 40.

Only I cannot omit to take notice of &s;ome of his Impertinencies upon this Head.</P>
<P>To my Arguments in my printed Sheet, repeated by him, pag. 33. <Q>What a ju&s;t and good man forbids another to do, he cannot, or at lea&s;t he ought not to per&s;wade him to do, other|wi&s;e he would do unju&s;tly, therefore what God forbids a man to do, it is repugnant to his Ju&s;tice to determine that man to do.</Q></P>
<P>This be quarrels with, as <HI>loo&s;ely formed, and as &s;avouring of a Quaker.</HI> But he is held &s;o fa&s;t in the Net by it, that in vain he &s;eeks to get out. It is the ordinary Policy of weak Di&s;putants, to cry out again&s;t the weakne&s;s of their Opponents Arguments, though ever &s;o &s;trong. But how does he an&s;wer?</P>

<P>IN my Re-view of Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> Book, among his many unfair and unju&s;t In&s;inuations again&s;t me; as well as po&s;itive Abu&s;es, I find in pag. 41. he very unju&s;tly &s;o&s;pects me, whether I hold <HI>That God in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;eth Grace into the faithful, whereby he hath a Principle of gracious Operation given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">in, which whether or no</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>my Antagoni&s;t will acknowledge, is to be &s;u&s;pected.</HI> But to ca&s;e him of his Su&s;picion, I tell him, I do cordially believe, as well as acknow|ledge, which at its fir&s;t infu&s;ion is as a grain of Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, but afterwards, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the operation of his holy Spirit, in the diligent u&s;e of the Means of Gods appoint|ment, by them who have it given them, it grows up, by degrees, to be a Tree of the greate&s;t of all Herbs.</P>
<P>Again, I find in pag. 48. he &s;aith, <Q><HI>Adams</HI> Fall, before it came to pa&s;s, was future, how el&s;e &s;hould God know it to be &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And if he did not know it, how was it that he laid in a Remedy again&s;t the fatal Con&s;equents of it, in &s;ome, before it was in act.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That <HI>Adams</HI> Fall, before it came to pa&s;s, was certainly future, and that God mo&s;t certainly and infallibly had a fore|knowledge of it, and therefore by his eternal Coun&s;el and Purpo&s;e laid in a Remedy again&s;t the fatal Con&s;equents of it, is granted, but that from thence it doth follow, that God did Nece&s;&s;itate <HI>Adam,</HI> or any man fince, to commit any &s;inful Action, or that God had decreed the futurity either of <HI>Adams</HI> &s;in, or did, in time, determine their Wills nece&s;&s;arily to &s;inful Actions, doth no ways follow. Therefore Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> might have &s;pared his Con&s;equence that he draws upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uppo&s;al, That God did

That</HI> (upon that Sup|po&s;al) <HI>if</HI> Adam <HI>had plea&s;ed he might have defeated the whole Com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Man's Redemption:</HI> I gave him not the lea&s;t ground to make any &s;uch Suppo&s;al, That God did not certainly and infallibly fore-kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>Alan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> would &s;in; therefore here, as oft el&s;e-where, (as the Proverb is) Mr. <HI>Willard makes to him&s;elf a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Straw,</HI> and then fights again&s;t it, and &s;o unprofitably wa&s;tes both Time and Paper, and puts me to this Labour, which is not altogether in vain to me, were it but to detect his impertinency, and his un&s;chollar-like way of arguing again&s;t what his Opponent doth not deny, but affirm as well as he No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doth it follow what certainly is future, is nece&s;&s;arily future by any Antecedent Nece&s;&s;ity to its futurition; for Certainty is one thing, and Nece&s;|&s;ity is another.</P>
<P>But let Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> an&s;wer me a Que&s;tion or two, 1. Could not God, if he had plea&s;ed, decreed to have pre&s;erved <HI>Adam</HI> from falling? for I hope he will not &s;ay, that God did nece&s;&s;arily decree him to fall, although it is conu&s;tent enough with his Principle, That freedom o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Will, and Nece&s;&s;ity, to act both im|manently and tran&s;iently, do well agree together; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that God did nece&s;&s;arily decree <HI>Adam</HI> to fall, yet by Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Principle, he did voluntarily and freely decree it, or to u&s;e his phra&s;e in another ca&s;e, he did decree it <HI>Lubenter,</HI> or <HI>cum Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, i. e.</HI> with a Lubency of Will.</P>
<P N="2">2. If God had plea&s;ed by his Decree, to pre&s;erve Man from falling, Man would certainly have &s;tood, and not have fallen, and Man had &s;tood, willingly, without any con&s;traint or com|pul&s;ion of his Will; but doth it therefore follow, that either God having decreed to keep Man from falling, or <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> being made willing, and well plea&s;ed to &s;tand, would have deceated the whole Contrivance of Man's Redemption? How could th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be defeated, which, on the Suppo&s;ition of God's having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Adam</HI> to &s;tand, and not to fall, would never have been d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">; nor would there have been any need o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any &s;uch Decree, if <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;tood; for the whole needs not the Phy&s;itian, and it <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;tood, he had needed no Phy&s;itian n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">? But yet upon the certain Futurity of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> tain and infal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e Fore-knowledge of it, it pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>And thus, I hope, I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewed, both the Futu|rity of Mens &s;inful Actions, and Gods certain and infallible Fore|knowledge or them, in another Gla&s;s than that of Gods Decree ab&s;olutely determining the Nece&s;&s;ity of them, without either e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>Stoical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate,</HI> or the Je&s;uits <HI>Scientia Media,</HI> one of which he would by Con&s;equence inter on me, but without all ground. And as to <HI>Stoical Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or what is equally ab&s;urd, I think I have above proved Mr. <HI>Willards</HI> Notion of <HI>Free-Will</HI> is &s;ufficiently con&s;i&s;tent with it.</P>
<P>But that God hath Not nece&s;&s;itated or determined men ne|ce&s;&s;arily to commit &s;uch &s;inful Actions, or decreed them to commit them by any &s;ecret Will or Decree, which had he done, would be contrary to his revealed Will he hath &s;poke by his holy Prophets, and commanded in the holy Scriptures, appears very evidently from many places of Scripture, particularly <HI>Jer.</HI> 19.5. <HI>They have built al&s;o the high Places of</HI> Baal, <HI>to burn their Sons with fire, for burnt Offerings unto</HI> Baal, <HI>which I commanded not</HI> (&s;aith the Lord) <HI>nor &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke it</HI> [con&s;equently not according to his revealed Will] <HI>neither came it unto my Mind</HI> [con&s;equently nor did he decree, purpo&s;e or will it, that they &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated to any &s;uch wicked Action] &s;ee the Parallel places, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.31. and Chap. 32. v. 35. in the Old Te&s;tament, and in the New Te&s;ta|ment, <HI>James</HI> 1.13, 14 <HI>Let no man &s;ay when he is Tempted, I am Tempted of God, for God cannot be Tempted with Evil, neither Temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e my man; but every man is Tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lu&s;t, and enticed.</HI> By the words <HI>[Tempted of God]</HI> I think cannot well be under&s;tood any moral Swa&s;ion or Com|mand of God, to &s;in; for &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition I never heard the wor&s;t of Hereticks or Bla&s;phemers charged with; but a &s;ort of People there were in <HI>England</HI> about forty years ago, called, <HI>Ranters,</HI> &s;ome Reliques whereof are yet extent, who (like &s;ome <HI>Gne&s;ticks</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s time) did hold, That God did inwardly

That all humane Wills, his and ours, and each propen&s;ion of our Wills, even during our Deliberation, are as much Nece&s;&s;itated as any thing el&s;e what&s;oever, that we have no more Power to forbear tho&s;e Actions which we do, than the fire hath not power to burn.</Q> [Note, <HI>How like this of Mr.</HI> Hobbs <HI>is to that of Mr.</HI> Willard <HI>in his Reply to me, &s;ee his page</HI> 43.]</P>

It makes the fir&s;t Cau&s;e to be the Introducer of all Evil and Sin into the World, as much as Man, yea, more than Man, by as much as the Motion of the Watch is more from the Artificer, who did make it, and wind it up, than either from the Spring, or the Wheels, or the Threed, if God by his <HI>Special Influences</HI> into the &s;econd Cau&s;es, did Nece&s;&s;itate them to operate, as they did.
