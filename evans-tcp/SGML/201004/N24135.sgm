<P>IT is with plea&s;ure I reflect, that the de&s;ign of your pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociation &s;o happily corre&s;ponds with the exhortation here urged by an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t. "Does any per&s;on find his circum&s;tances ea&s;y and pro&s;perous, and his mind enlivened with joy? Let him vent the grateful and joyous emotions of his heart in &s;ongs of prai&s;e." The vivacity of ea&s;tern nations, is &s;trongly marked in this recom|mendation, as mu&s;ic has been, and &s;till is, more practi&s;ed among them, than tho&s;e of the we&s;t. Mu&s;ic, among&s;t that &s;prightly people, holds a principal place in all their fe&s;tivals, common or religious, and never fails to attend their public proce&s;&s;ions, or private excur&s;ions for amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure. Its &s;oothing influ|ence

is equally reli&s;hed in the palace of the prince, and the tent of the wandering &s;hep|herd. It may not be improper to remark, that the pa&s;&s;age principally re&s;pects the mu&s;ic it&s;elf; this will appear from a plain tran&s;lation: "Is any chearful? Let him make melody." So that the precept, has more for its object, the mu&s;ic which accompanies a &s;acred &s;ong, than the &s;ong it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here, then, is a divine warrant for the part you are to act on this occa&s;ion; and per|mit me to congratulate you on the propriety of your conduct in recognizing a law of chri&s;|tianity, rather than the corrupt maxims of the gay and incon&s;iderate part of mankind: while others haunt the theatre of folly, and a&s;&s;ociate for criminal fe&s;tivity and mirth, you nobly chu&s;e the more rational, but unfa&s;hionable, mode of expre&s;&s;ing cheerfulne&s;s, by a cour&s;e of harmonious prai&s;e to the King of Saints. While the unthinking exult at the &s;ound of pro&s;tituted melody, and tread the unhallowed maze of a guilty revel, you, animated by a nobler ambition, a&s;pire to the pure and eno|bling plea&s;ures of &s;acred harmony; and enter|tain too high a &s;en&s;e of the dignity of tho&s;e powers with which heaven has endued you, to degrade them in the &s;ervice of vice, however popular. Such at lea&s;t is the language of your pre&s;ent meeting; and happy, very happy, I may &s;afely call you, if it be al&s;o the language of your hearts.</P>

<P N="1">I. Mu&s;ic has its foundation in the nature of man. He is formed with powers and ca|pacities equally &s;uited to invent, and perform it: to under&s;tand, and reli&s;h the eloquent ex|pre&s;&s;ions it carries to the heart. Mu&s;ic &s;eems to be a kind of univer&s;al language, breathing to the ear intimations clear and intelligible, addre&s;&s;ing the heart with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s eloquence, and putting into motion all the finer &s;prings of human nature. The charms of a good piece of mu&s;ic, will excite the &s;ame delightful &s;en&s;ations among all nations on the globe, however diver&s;ified as to language or manners. Many curious and even fabulous things have been &s;aid concerning its origin. Dr. Brown, with others, is of opinion, that man was led to the practice of vocal mu&s;ic in imitation of the birds, as they &s;ung their &s;oft and melting &s;trains in the fore&s;ts around him. Kircher thinks with Diadorus, that the fir&s;t idea of this art was obtained from the noi&s;e of the wind

whi&s;tling through the hollows of reeds on the banks of the Nile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lucretius &s;eems to unite both the&s;e opinions in the following lines:

<P>See Rou&s;&s;eau's Dictionaire de Mu&s;ique. Art. Mu&s;ique.</P></NOTE> Some, un&s;atisfied with de|riving it from either of the&s;e &s;ources, and unable to give a more probable account of its origin, have had recour&s;e to a divine interpo&s;ition; while others profe&s;s them&s;elves wholly at a lo&s;s to &s;ay how it originated. To me it &s;eems the lea&s;t exceptionable opinion, which places the origin of mu&s;ic in the emotions of the human mind, when much rou&s;ed and agitated by the contemplation of grand and affecting objects. Struck with the beauties and wonders of nature, man would &s;pontaneou&s;ly vent the glowing enraptured affections of his mind in poetry and &s;ong. When the imagination was fired, and the mind &s;trongly moved by extraordinary &s;cenes, or intere&s;ting events; when the emo|tions of the &s;oul became too big for common utterance; they bur&s;t into &s;ong, and overflowed in &s;trains of corre&s;ponding melody. This is
<PB N="7" REF="031912_0006_0FEF4D195F11A0E8">
the true &s;ource of poetry and mu&s;ic: they were both prompted by the &s;ame cau&s;e, generated by the &s;ame impul&s;e, and blended in the &s;ame character. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e two arts will tell you that they began their career together, and were never &s;eparated, until civilization and national improvement had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s. Hence it is, we &s;ee &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance in the nature and effects of the&s;e arts; and &s;uch a likene&s;s, or even &s;amene&s;s, in the terms by which they are known and de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription Milton gives of the devo|tions of the fir&s;t pair, when they awoke from &s;leep, and opened their eyes on the beauties of Eden, is, I think, very natural:
<Q><L>Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began</L>
<L>Their ori&s;ons, each morning duly paid</L>
<L>in fit &s;trains pronounced or &s;ung</L>
<L><HI>Unmeditated,</HI> &s;uch prompt eloquence</L>
<L>Flow'd from their lips,</L>
<L>More tunable than needed lute or harp</L>
<L>To add more &s;weetne&s;s.</L></Q>
The poet &s;truck upon the true &s;ource of mu&s;ic, a mind &s;welled to rapture and enthu&s;ia&s;m, by the contemplation of the works of God, and unburdening it&s;elf in prompt, unmeditated me|lody. There &s;eems to be a very perceivable analogy between mu&s;ical &s;ounds and the affec|tions of the mind; and a &s;triking relation in all the tones of mu&s;ic, and the various modu|lations of the voice among&s;t men in amicable
<PB N="8" REF="031912_0007_0FEF4D2E352316A0">
intercour&s;e. Beauty or grandeur, in a piece of mu&s;ic, ari&s;es from this, that the &s;ounds in combination expre&s;s the beautiful or grand in minds, and perhaps, what is called expre&s;&s;ion in this art, is &s;olely owing to the relation of &s;ounds to mental affection.</P>
<P>"In harmony, the very names of concord and di&s;cord are metaphorical, and &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome analogy between the relations of &s;ound, to which they are figuratively applied, and the relations of minds and affections which they originally and properly &s;ignify. To me it &s;eems, that every &s;train in melody that is agreeable, is an imitation of the tones of the human voice in the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reid.</NOTE> If this be accurate, it &s;erves to &s;hew, that mu&s;ic has its origin from mind, and al&s;o, that it is an art truly noble, which can only expre&s;s what is &s;ublime and lovely in the mind of man.</P>
<P>It is proper al&s;o to remark the exact cor|re&s;pondence, and intimate connection, &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between the various pa&s;&s;ions of the heart, and the &s;everal airs in mu&s;ic. The diver&s;ities of &s;ound, corre&s;pond with admirable preci&s;ion, to all the varieties of mental affection. There are the joyful, the animating, the melting, the pen&s;ive &s;trains of mu&s;ic, an&s;wering to the joy, the courage, the tenderne&s;s, and the melan|choly of mind. But why are the different tones
<PB N="9" REF="031912_0008_0FEF4CF2F3161060">
of mu&s;ic, and the movements of the mind, in &s;uch delightful uni&s;on? Doubtle&s;s becau&s;e the one is the genuine offspring of the other.</P>
<P>Again, fact proves the account I have given of the ri&s;e of mu&s;ic to be true. In the mo&s;t rude, untutored nations, where the agricultural and mechanic arts are almo&s;t unknown, it is found to be cultivated to a degree of perfection, truly a&s;toni&s;hing. It is &s;aid of the inhabitants of the Sandwich I&s;lands, a people in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of &s;avage barbarity, that they had attained to &s;uch &s;kill in the practice of mu&s;ic, as to perform in the parts with tolerable ea&s;e and propriety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cook's Voyages, vol. 2. p. 311. 312.</NOTE>. However that may be, it is certain, their com|po&s;itions and manner of performing were by no means contemptible. Nor do I recollect a &s;ingle nation, who&s;e hi&s;tory has reached me, &s;o rude as to have had no knowledge of mu&s;ic. All have their war &s;ongs, dirges and hymns in prai&s;e of the deities they adore. And I may add too, that the&s;e &s;ongs among the Arabs, and other nations, are often the effu&s;ions of the moment, dictated by &s;uch objects, as immedi|ately intere&s;t the attention. It would &s;eem, that extemporary &s;ongs were frequent among the Children of I&s;rael; of this kind appear to have been, tho&s;e of the daughter of Jephtha with her chorus of Virgins, celebrating her father's victo|ry and of the I&s;raeliti&s;h women, who went out to meet Saul and David on occa&s;ion of a &s;ignal
<PB N="10" REF="031912_0009_0FEF4D07D40D6858">
triumph over the Phili&s;tines, &s;inging alter|nately:
<Q><L>"Saul has &s;lain his thou&s;ands:</L>
<L>"And David his ten thou&s;ands."</L></Q>
Upon what principle then can we account for this univer&s;al ta&s;te and practice of mu&s;ic but that man was invincibly led to it, from the ori|ginal make of his nature, and the circum&s;tances of his &s;ituation? It is the language of pa&s;&s;ion and is derivable from no other &s;ource.</P>
<P>There can be no error in placing the date of mu&s;ic as coeval with the exi&s;tence of man, if I have been correct in &s;tating its true origin. Very early in the hi&s;tory of human kind, we find Jubal honored, as the father of &s;uch as han|dle the harp and organ; and there can be no doubt, that in&s;trumental mu&s;ic was po&s;terior to that of the voice, by a con&s;iderable length of time. Sublime, and almo&s;t cele&s;tial we may well conceive, were the anthems of innocent beings, when creation glowed before them in the un&s;ullied lu&s;tre of its charms. Strains a-kin to tho&s;e of Seraphs, echoed through the bowers of Paradi&s;e, when man wore the image of his God, and nature had not langui&s;hed at the &s;ight of &s;in! The lap&s;e of human nature, we may &s;uppo&s;e, introduced &s;ome change into the mu&s;ic of mortals. 'Till then, harmony had not &s;haped it&s;elf to the modulations of &s;orrow, nor learned to waft the &s;igh of the wretched. That which once breathed the &s;weet language
<PB N="11" REF="031912_0010_0FEF4CFF9FE74068">
of holy joy and exultation, has, &s;ince that mournful event, poured &s;orth the melting &s;trains of pity and grief. Mu&s;ic, being no longer the &s;ole companion of devotion and rapture, wept at the tomb of departed friends, rou&s;ed the courage of the hero, animated the &s;ufferer to patience, cheered the tent of the &s;hepherd, and &s;oothed the &s;olitude of the langui&s;hing &s;wain. And I wi&s;h, for the honor of humanity, I could &s;ay, it had not been forced to &s;peak the lan|guage of guilty pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;erve at the altar of impure love. Happy &s;hould I be, to draw a veil over the ba&s;e pro&s;titution, or blot the page that reveals the &s;hame of our nature, but impartiality bids me &s;ay, that mu&s;ic has been degraded to the vile purpo&s;es of folly, luxury, and vice. And it is remarkable, that when devoted in this way, it a&s;&s;umes new appear|ances and effects, taking the ca&s;t of the criminal pa&s;&s;ions whence it &s;prung, and adding redou|bled violence to vicious de&s;ires and habits. We are not told how early this corruption took place, nor to what extent it was diffu&s;ed, in the fir&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety. I am willing to be|lieve, it had not &s;pread very generally, nor put on its mo&s;t dangerous forms until nations be|came wealthy, powerful, and luxurious. The earlie&s;t annals of mankind a&s;&s;ure us, that mu&s;ic was for a long &s;eries of time, limited to &s;acred wor&s;hip, or other &s;erious purpo&s;es; and the mo&s;t ancient &s;ongs, to which we have acce&s;s, were either addre&s;&s;es to the Deity, or grave compo&s;itions on war, national deliverances, or
<PB N="12" REF="031912_0011_0FEF4CE6E57B42B8">
cata&s;trophies, and the various vici&s;&s;itudes of do|me&s;tic life. According to the&s;e accounts, the laws, moral in&s;tructions, the memoirs of illu&s;|trious characters, the theology, and hi&s;tory of nations, were in the fir&s;t ages, &s;ung by their bards to the &s;ound of the lyre. It is &s;aid of the ancient Pythagoreans, that they made mu|&s;ic a &s;pecial part of &s;tudy, and availed them|&s;elves of its powerful influence to inflame the mind with the love of virtue, and rou&s;e it to the atchievement of noble and virtuous actions. The &s;ublime notion entertained by the&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers concerning mu&s;ic, was that the &s;oul was originally formed to harmony, and that the mo&s;t direct way to re&s;tore intellectual or &s;piritual harmony to the &s;oul, was to have recour&s;e to the harmony of &s;ound.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau Dictionaire de Mu&s;ique. Art. Mu&s;ique.</NOTE> The I&s;raelites were long in the habit of u&s;ing mu&s;ic, on grave and &s;olemn occa&s;ions. When &s;ucce&s;s attended their arms, or &s;ome long wi&s;hed-for deliverance occurred; when they approached God in the &s;anctuary, or ob&s;erved a &s;olemn fe&s;tival; when they afflicted them&s;elves for public or private lo&s;&s;es; when their prophets gave le&s;&s;ons on moral &s;ubjects, or foretold fu|ture events; they never failed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ll in the aid of harmony, to give &s;cope to their joys or &s;or|rows, and energy to their in&s;tructions. For in&s;tances you have only to recur to a book with which I hope you are daily conver&s;ant. There you will &s;ee the triumphal &s;ongs of Mo&s;es, Deborah, Hannah, and others; the tender elegy of David over Saul and Jonathan; and
<PB N="13" REF="031912_0012_0FEF4CDD91A282D8">
the numerous devotional odes con&s;tantly &s;ung in the Tabernacle. There you will &s;ee their prophets delivering &s;acred in&s;tructions, and uttering predictions, with the accompanyment of a tabret or pipe. That beautiful preceptive &s;ong, recorded Deut. 32, &s;eems to have been &s;ung before a convention of all I&s;rael, by Mo&s;es and Ho&s;hea the &s;on of Nun. Mention is made, 1 Sam. 10.5, of a college of prophets, who "prophe&s;ied with a p&s;altery and a tabret, and a pipe;" and, while a min&s;trel played before Eli&s;ha, at his own reque&s;t, the &s;pirit of pro|phe&s;y came upon him, and he predicted, to the kings who waited on him, a &s;peedy and copi|ous &s;hower of rain, and a remarkable victory over their enemies. And that melody frequently &s;erved as a vehicle for conveying le&s;&s;ons of di|vine wi&s;dom, farther appears from the decla|ration of the P&s;almi&s;t: "I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark &s;peech upon a harp." I will only add, that mu&s;ic &s;et to &s;acred &s;ubjects, was very probably &s;ung and played by that people in their journeys to and from Jeru&s;alem,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Some have &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e fifteen p&s;alms, which are each intitled, "A Song of Degrees," relate to the a&s;cent of I&s;rael out of the Babyloni&s;h captivity; may they not rather be thus marked to denote they were wont to be &s;ung in the journies of I&s;rael up to Jeru&s;alem from time to time?

And it ought not to be omitted, that mu&s;ic was u&s;ed on more private occa&s;ions; &s;uch as do|me&s;tic rejoicings, the parting of friends, and watching of flocks. Jer. 33.10, 11; Gen. 31.27; 1 Sam. 16.16&mdash;19; P&s;al. 137. But it does not &s;trike me, that it de&s;erted the cau&s;e of virtue and religion among&s;t that people, till elated with wealth and intoxicated with power. And among unpoli&s;hed nations, it was chiefly confined to their temples, or other intere&s;ting &s;cenes, with which their peculiar &s;uper&s;titions intermixed. It is not however to be concealed, that it was often practi&s;ed in the celebration of impure rites, and &s;hocking devotions, that took their complexion from the idol or deity that was wor&s;hipped: but &s;till, it was not profe&s;&s;|edly &s;eparated to the aid of criminal plea&s;ures. It was not till &s;he aro&s;e to affluence and power that "Tyre &s;ung as an harlot:" and when Solomon wantoned on the lap of luxury, "he

got him men-&s;ingers and women-&s;ingers, and the delights of the &s;ons of men, as mu&s;ical in|&s;truments of all &s;orts."</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h nation &s;eems to hold the pre-eminence in the hi&s;tory of mu&s;ic. If their mu|&s;ical compo&s;itions bore any re&s;emblance to tho&s;e in poetry, as is ju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e, we may infer much to their merit: they mu&s;t have been bold, &s;imple, and empa&s;&s;ioned to a high degree. It mu&s;t be granted, that the Hebrew poetry, for richne&s;s of imagery, boldne&s;s of colouring, dignity of &s;entiment, &s;implicity, and energy of diction, &s;tands unrivalled by the productions of other nations; and I mu&s;t conclude that the &s;ame &s;pirit which dictated tho&s;e inimitable odes, was capable of producing &s;trains of harmony equally excellent. As far back as the time of Mo&s;es, we find the matrons of I&s;rael, led by the prophete&s;s Miriam, &s;ing a very animated ode in the re&s;pon&s;ory, joining the &s;ound of their timbrels to the melody of their voices: and in the illu&s;trious reign of David him&s;elf (the be&s;t poet and mu&s;ician of his day), not le&s;s than 4000 Levites were appointed to &s;ing hymns, &amp; exhibit on in&s;truments in the &s;ervice of the tabernacle. From the form of the Hebrew ver&s;e, and what is &s;aid, Ezra, 3.11, of &s;inging "by cour&s;e," it is plain the manner of &s;inging was re&s;pon|&s;ive, the &s;everal choirs an&s;wering alternately to each other; and I am induced to think it probable, from the di&s;tribution of the bands of &s;ingers, 1 Chron. 15. 19&mdash;23, that more than
<PB N="16" REF="031912_0015_0FEF4D24973A74F8">
one part was wont to be &s;ung.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There we read of one choir of &s;ingers appointed to &s;ound with cymbals of bra&s;s, another with p&s;alteries on ala|moth, and a third with harps on the &s;heminith; though it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay what is to be under&s;tood by the words alamoth and &s;heminith; yet the mo&s;t likely opinion is, that they both relate to the different parts of the harmony practi&s;ed in tho&s;e times.

The dignity of the ea&s;tern mu&s;ic, abhorred &s;uch paltry refinements, as characterize the artificial and almo&s;t Gothic compo&s;itions of later times. It was the bur&s;t of &s;acred pa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps I might &s;ay, of in&s;piration; for on what other principle can we account for the &s;ublime genius and peculiar &s;tructure of the Hebrew poetry and mu&s;ic; and the purity, &s;plendour, and maje&s;ty of that wor&s;hip they were u&s;ed to ce|lebrate, which I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay form an illu&s;trious exception to all the monuments of antiquity.</P>
<P>Some ingenious writers have inferred, that the mu&s;ic of the Hebrews could not have been very good, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent mu&s;ic of the ea&s;t is &s;orry and contemptible; but I think it is not fair to determine the character of their

<P>It has been much agitated by writers on this &s;ubject, whether harmony was known to the ancients. I have already &s;uppo&s;ed the I&s;raelites acquainted with it, and when I find the rude I&s;lander &s;inging a different part, or at lea&s;t performing a kind of ba&s;s with his bam|boo, and when I hear the untaught African among our&s;elves, attempting the &s;ame by &s;ing|ing on a graver tone and beating his calaba&s;h in company with another performer; I can|not conceive the poli&s;hed Greeks and Romans to have been ignorant of harmony. They who&s;e mu&s;ic produced &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing effects, mu&s;t have under&s;tood its &s;weete&s;t energies and mo&s;t pathetic combinations.

There &s;eems to be &s;omething like mu&s;ical painting or de&s;crip|tion. "The mo&s;t elevated &s;en&s;ation of mu&s;ic, &s;ays U&s;her, ari&s;es from a confu&s;ed perception of ideal or vi&s;ionary beauty, and rapture, which is &s;ufficiently perceivable to fire the imagina|tion, but not clear enough to become an object of knowledge. This &s;hadowy beauty of the mind attempts, with langui&s;hing curio&s;ity, to collect into a di&s;tinct object of view and com|prehen&s;ion; but &s;inks and e&s;capes like the di&s;|&s;olving ideas of a delightful dream, that are neither within the reach of memory, nor yet totally fled." What this elegant author attri|butes chiefly to the &s;en&s;ations produced in mind by mu&s;ic, would, with more accuracy, apply to tho&s;e confu&s;ed vi&s;ions or &s;hadowy repre&s;en|tations of pa&s;&s;ions or things it &s;eems capable of giving.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="031912_0019_0FEF4CECD5C70708">But it is to be ob&s;erved, though mu&s;ic has the power of exciting all human affections, by the pictures it pre&s;ents to the mind, yet it never in&s;pires any that are not of the virtuous and ennobling ca&s;t, if not perverted from its original purity. It is friendly to every pa&s;&s;ion which forms the dignity and happine&s;s of human kind. It &s;weetens the temper, refines and ennobles the mind, and elevates the powers of the &s;oul to the contemplation and love of moral beauty. Even when the emotions produced by it are gay and plea&s;ant, they are not dangerous to virtue: and it is the &s;ingular property of this art, to infu&s;e a certain &s;weetne&s;s with every &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ation it produces.

<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve &s;ome things concerning the indirect influence of mu&s;ic to promote our happine&s;s. It not only bani&s;hes or mitigates the cares and di&s;quietudes of life, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;urpri&s;ing power over that black groupe of depraved pa&s;&s;ions that agitate the brea&s;t of man: Malice, envy, rage, anger, and a thir&s;t of revenge, tho&s;e demons that ravage the empire of the heart, and aim at de&s;olating the globe, die away before the &s;acred magic of &s;ound. Of its influence over melancholy, you have a fine in&s;tance in &s;acred hi&s;tory, where it is &s;aid, the evil &s;pirit which troubled Saul, gave way to the charms of David's lyre.

<P>We have &s;een already, that mu&s;ic makes a part of the religious wor&s;hip of all nations, and that it was originally limited to that pur|po&s;e: I would then a&s;k, why this deep-rooted and univer&s;ally prevalent &s;entiment, with re|gard to mu&s;ic's being a proper in&s;trument of prai&s;e to the Deity?

<P N="3">III. I now come to &s;peak of the moral tendency or effects of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, permit me to ob&s;erve, that a very important effect appears to be informa|tion and conviction. By the proper union of poetry and mu&s;ic, truth mu&s;t be borne with almo&s;t re&s;i&s;tle&s;s energy to the under&s;tanding and heart. The law of our nature is &s;uch, that unle&s;s the under&s;tanding be enlightened by truth, no conviction or impre&s;&s;ion can be pro|duced. Sacred harmony, like every other or|dinance of God, being adapted to the laws of human nature, addre&s;&s;es man as a rational creature, by enlightening the mind, while it rou&s;es and intere&s;ts the feelings of the heart.&mdash; Hence we &s;ee the force of the Apo&s;tle's con|clu&s;ion, "I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and I will &s;ing with the under&s;tanding al&s;o:" He under|&s;tood human nature too well, to &s;uppo&s;e any valuable or permanent effect would be pro|duced by p&s;almody, unle&s;s the mind had a di&s;|tinct perception of truth.

in p&s;alms, hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, al&s;o implies, that a principal de&s;ign of p&s;almody is, to enlighten and convince. When a &s;pi|ritual &s;ong, or hymn, embracing the truths of Chri&s;tianity in their purity, is attended by the pathetic expre&s;&s;ion of corre&s;ponding &s;ounds, it is pre&s;umed, the happy re&s;ult will be a deep and penetrating conviction, or belief of their reality and importance. Is it po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ublime, the moving, the animating doctrines of the cro&s;s, which repre&s;ent the glories of the divine character and government, the wonders of re|deeming love, the native guilt and mi&s;ery of man, the dignity and felicity to which he is advanced by grace, with all the augu&s;t &s;cenes of a future &s;tate, can be addre&s;&s;ed to the heart, by the eloquence of &s;ound, without effect? It is not probable&mdash;So far as a natural mean can influence, the &s;inner mu&s;t tremble; the &s;aint mu&s;t rejoice! And if conviction be not gained, nothing is done to purpo&s;e; without this a thoughtle&s;s world will &s;leep &s;ecure; without this the pious will want comfort and edification. I wi&s;h not to be mi&s;taken here; when I &s;peak of information and conviction being effectuated by p&s;almody, I mean nothing more than that it becomes &s;o, under a &s;uperior agency. It is the ble&s;&s;ed comforter alone who can convince of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment; but &s;till, it mu&s;t be allowed, he does &s;o by co-operating with the means of his own appointment. If then p&s;almody be a divine ordinance, and if it be a forcible method of conveying truth to the mind, I think it unque&s;tionable that &s;uch will

And I am of opinion, the &s;ame is implied, Eph. 5.19&mdash; "Speaking to your&s;elves in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs; &s;inging and making me|lody in your hearts to the Lord;" where &s;ome|thing like an in&s;tructive recitative is probably meant.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The hymn &s;ung by our Lord and his di&s;ciples after the &s;upper, the &s;ongs of Zecharias, Mary and Elizabeth, the &s;ong which attended Chri&s;t's triumphal entrance into Jeru&s;alem, and the one &s;ung by the apo&s;tles and the whole church, Acts 4.24&mdash;31, were al&s;o, I apprehend, of the extempore kind, and very probably &s;ung in the manner above de&s;cribed.</NOTE> And if I recollect right, it is the ge|neral opinion of commentators, that the pri|mitive hymns and odes were commonly prompt

<P>Again, it is the tendency of p&s;almody to promote purity of heart, and the comforts of piety. Whatever carries divine truth to the heart, mu&s;t be allowed to have &s;uch a tenden|cy: "And ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free&mdash;Sanctify them thro' thy truth; thy word is truth&mdash;We are cho&s;en through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit and belief of the truth&mdash;What&s;oever was written, afore|time, was written for our in&s;truction, that we through patience and comfort of the &s;criptures might have hope." The&s;e &s;criptures teach us, that holine&s;s and comfort come through a knowledge of &s;acred truth. How happy and powerful a method then mu&s;t that be, of pro|ducing the&s;e effects, which carries the truths of revelation to the mind by the per&s;ua&s;ive ener|gies of harmonious &s;ound. It has been already &s;aid, that mu&s;ic alone has power to excite all the various affections of the mind, and to &s;often and humanize the di&s;po&s;ition; is it not there|fore allowable to &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t forcible and vivid impre&s;&s;ions will be made, and the moral improvement of our nature be&s;t an&s;wered, when it becomes the vehicle of divine truth? There is perhaps no holy affection, which may not, with the concurrence of a divine influence, be

excited, enlarged, improved, or refined, by the aid of harmony. By this the &s;oul is elevated to tran&s;port and exultation, when the goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of God, the glories of the Re|deemer, the fullne&s;s and &s;tability of the pro|mi&s;es, or the future rewards of virtue, is the theme; by this it melts in grateful &s;orrows for its numerous &s;ins and follies, and &s;inks in lowe&s;t pro&s;tration before its God; by this it rou&s;es to indignation again&s;t &s;in: and burns with gener|ous ardour in the &s;piritual warfare; yes, by this divine&s;t con&s;olations are in&s;pired, and the heart moulded into the &s;weetne&s;s of piety.

The &s;oothing influence of divine mu&s;ic, in the dark hour of affliction, was well under&s;tood by him who &s;aid, "In the night his &s;ong &s;hall be with me; &mdash;thy &s;tatutes have been my &s;ongs in the hou&s;e of my pilgrimage," P&s;al. 42.8&mdash;119.54; and Paul and Silas, at midnight, forgot their pains, and relieved the horrors of confinement, by chanting forth the prai&s;es of God.

We can &s;carcely hear a piece of mu&s;ic in the modern &s;tyle, without ob&s;erving all the proprie|ties of language, and all the charms and graces of poetry, horribly mangled and disfigured: no attention is paid to empha&s;is, cadence, or pronunciation; the ear is cloyed with endle&s;s repetition, or confu&s;ed by a crowd of different words or &s;entences, a&s;&s;ailing it at once.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will find &s;ome excellent ob&s;ervations on modern mu&s;ic made by Dr. Franklin in a letter to his brother.

There is &s;o much confu&s;ion in the management of the&s;e pieces, that a hearer cannot under&s;tand what is &s;ung, and the &s;ingers them&s;elves mu&s;t have their attention very much divided.

Nothing can be more improper, than the introduction of &s;uch compo&s;itions into the harmony of the church.

cannot let &s;o far an opportunity pa&s;s, without remarking upon the injurious tendency of the reigning ta&s;te in mu&s;ic. The lea&s;t ob&s;ervation will teach you, that the mu&s;ic which is now mo&s;t in e&s;teem, is not calculated to produce, but ra|ther to counteract, the effects I have attributed to p&s;almody.

There &s;hould be al|ways one part tuneful, and the others &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed as to give force to the melody. Doctor Madan's pieces have &s;ingular merit in this re&s;pect; in them the melody ever pre|dominates, and is promoted by the harmony of the other parts but they are too refined and difficult to be generally u&s;eful.</NOTE> (I know not better how to expre&s;s my&s;elf), in the harmony, there can be nothing like in&s;truction or edification.

Here let me correct a &s;entiment, which though popular and &s;anc|tioned by &s;ome venerable names, is neverthele&s;s wrong: "That we &s;hould take the Devil's tunes and convert them to a religious u&s;e."

the frivolous unmeaning airs of the opera or the army, to the &s;ublime and awfully augu&s;t doctrines of our holy religion? Can tunes, which are the mere froth of criminal pa&s;&s;ions, and only &s;erve to inflame impure de&s;ire, ever be|come &s;o far regenerated, as to be in&s;trumental in lighting up a flame of &s;acred pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;oul? And is it not the direct way to depreciate divine truths, and le&s;&s;en their influence upon the mind, to introduce them into the &s;anctuary?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A rage for mu&s;ic of this de&s;cription, has given birth to a variety of hymns of the &s;ame complexion, which to me are extremely di&s;gu&s;ting.

The remarks I have taken the liberty to make, are not intended to &s;ugge&s;t, that all the mu&s;ic which is out of the church, is nece&s;&s;arily uncha&s;te: I admire the &s;implicity and &s;prightline&s;s of many of the war|like and ballad tunes; but though they may have their u&s;e, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e they ever can be &s;o baptized as to be perfectly Chri&s;tian, or &s;uitable to the maje&s;ty of divine &s;ubjects.</NOTE> I do not mean, however, to pa&s;s an indi&s;crimi|nate cen&s;ure upon all the mu&s;ical productions of our own or pa&s;t times, which may have reached us; there are a &s;ufficient number of them free from the exceptions I have made, and from their &s;implicity and pathos are ju&s;tly entitled to the Poet's de&s;cription:

<P>But tunes may be truly excellent, and yet im|properly applied: to &s;ing a bri&s;k animating air,
<PB N="34" REF="031912_0033_0FEF4D27DEA809A8">
to a mournful theme, or a plaintive one to a joyful &s;ubject, is very unnatural, and tends very much to de&s;troy the influence of both the mu&s;ic and the poetry. Tho&s;e who conduct this part of wor&s;hip, &s;hould be careful to &s;elect tunes that are adapted to the nature of the &s;ubject about to be &s;ung.</P>
<P>Again, I infer the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring &s;o much knowledge of mu&s;ic, as to be able to practi&s;e it with ea&s;e and propriety. It is not wonderful, that the moral effects of mu&s;ic are &s;o incon&s;iderable, when we con&s;ider the poor, pitiful manner, in which it is performed. I mean not to reflect upon pious, well-thinking people, who have never had an opportunity for improvement in &s;inging; but when none but a &s;ingle part is &s;ung, and that in a drow&s;y, un|&s;kilful manner; when a few hackneyed tunes, are droned out in di&s;mal accents to all &s;ubjects indi&s;criminately; and when the whole &s;ervice is interrupted till the chief mu&s;ician reads, or rather dolefully cants, out the line; what edi|fication can be expected? How ba&s;e and cri|minal is &s;uch negligence! All mu&s;t grant that God has endued us with powers to reli&s;h and execute harmony; I would then enquire for what purpo&s;es were they be&s;towed? Was it that they might be abandoned, to the celebra|tion of wanton themes, or at be&s;t, to the u&s;e of idle amu&s;ements? Or was it that they &s;hould be &s;acred and appropriate to the &s;ervice of their great author? Every hone&s;t heart knows the an&s;wer! The truth is, God has given the&s;e ta|lents

in tru&s;t, and commanded us to occupy till he come; if we then &s;uffer them to lie unim|proved, when we enjoy means for their culti|vation, or wickedly pervert them to an impro|per u&s;e, we may expect, as "wicked and un|profitable &s;ervants, to be ca&s;t into outer dark|ne&s;s," no more to hear the gladdening voice of harmony, but the dire di&s;cord of "weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth" forever.&mdash; "Cur&s;ed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and &s;acrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing." Mal. 1.14. Hear it and tremble, ye that neglect to cultivate your powers of harmony; hear it and tremble, ye that impiou&s;ly dare to profane mu&s;ic, at a guilty revel, or the midnight debauch! "Wo unto them that ri&s;e up early in the morning, that they may follow &s;trong drink, that continue until night, till wine inflame them. And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine are in their fea&s;ts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither con&s;ider the operation of his hands. Therefore hell hath enlarged her|&s;elf, and opened her mouth without mea&s;ure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, &s;hall de&s;cend into it." I&s;ai. 5.11&mdash;15.</P>
<P>I further ob&s;erve, that the Chri&s;tian's amu&s;ement ought to con&s;i&s;t in &s;acred mu&s;ic.&mdash; This may perhaps appear &s;trange and novel to the gay part of my audience, but it is many centuries &s;ince the doctrine was taught: it is as
<PB N="36" REF="031912_0035_0FEF4D2625291790">
old as the apo&s;tolic age; "Is any merry? Let him &s;ing p&s;alms." I know the maxim is not likely to be popular, but I &s;hall not blu&s;h to e&s;pou&s;e or practi&s;e it, while I find it in the &s;a|cred volume. Much has been &s;aid in prai&s;e of various kinds of recreation, but I have never &s;een any thing to convince me, that tho&s;e gay &s;cenes called amu&s;ements, are either profitable or &s;afe for the Chri&s;tian; and &s;hould he indulge in them, he will find he treads unhallowed ground, and breathes an air that chills the fer|vors of his piety. What amu&s;ement can &s;o &s;weetly unbend a pious mind, when fatigued by the cares and bu&s;tle of life, or qualify it for the returns of bu&s;ine&s;s, as the plea&s;ant exerci&s;e of chanting a &s;ong of Zion, in concert with a well-cho&s;en in&s;trument? What can make the intervals of active life &s;o delightfully entertain|ing, and cau&s;e our vacant hours to glide &s;o &s;oftly away, as the ravi&s;hing drains of &s;acred harmo|ny? Duty, plea&s;ure and recreation, would then unite; a union very rare in mo&s;t other amu&s;e|ments! Did Chri&s;tians thus relieve the fatigues of labour and bu&s;ine&s;s, we would &s;oon &s;ee the happie&s;t con&s;equences re&s;ulting from it: the practical knowledge of mu&s;ic would abound; a &s;weet favor of piety and &s;olid joy, would en|liven the dome&s;tic circle; and beauty, order, and harmony, become con&s;picuous in our churches. "The pious Mr. Nicholas exhibited, in the la&s;t century, an in&s;tance of a Prote&s;tant family, in which a con&s;tant cour&s;e of p&s;almody was appointed, and &s;o &s;trictly kept up, that, through the whole four and twenty hours of

Be per&s;uaded then, to fill up your cheerful hours with the plea&s;ures of harmony, and let "the voice of joy and &s;alvation be heard in your tabernacles."</P>
<P>I have only to add, that when the exter|nal part of prai&s;e is performed, your duty is not done; there is a "&s;inging with the under|&s;tanding," and "melody of heart," without which your prai&s;e cannot be acceptable. En|deavour to get an experimental acquaintance with the truths you utter in your &s;ongs of prai&s;e, and let this be accompanied by a &s;weet concert of holy affections. Let every &s;entiment of love, gratitude, and reverence, fill your minds, and holy joy and peace expand your hearts, when you prai&s;e the Eternal; or at lea&s;t, let humble penitence, ardent de&s;ires after holine&s;s, and a proper &s;en&s;e of your weakne&s;s and dependence, give life and &s;pirit to your devotions. Cold, &s;piritle&s;s prai&s;es, do but in&s;ult God, and are unprofitable to your&s;elves. Let the noble&s;t

ends of prai&s;e be an&s;wered in you, that at la&s;t you may be prepared, to bear a part in the harmony of the general a&s;&s;embly of the fir&s;t-born in heaven: and my la&s;t, and mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h is, that your &s;ongs here, may be an in|troduction to that bur&s;t of uncea&s;ing rapture and triumph, which forms at once the prai&s;e and felicity of the heavenly Sion!
