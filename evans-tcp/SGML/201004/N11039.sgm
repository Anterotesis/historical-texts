<HEAD>To his Tyrannic Maje&s;ty&mdash;the DEVIL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t infernal Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO not affect the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at this addre&s;s; it comes not in the tremendous form of a Petition; of the&s;e your &s;ulky Maje&s;ty &s;hall have no more during the &s;hort time you can hope to tyrannize over us in a regal &s;hape. What I humbly offer now, concerns, not your infe&s;ted and afflicted kingdoms, &s;o nearly as your dear &s;elf and favourites. Your Maje&s;ty's be&s;t beloved &s;pirits, Bute and Mansfield, the whole a&s;toni&s;hed world con&s;ider as the blacke&s;t imps in all your train; and your&s;elf, as their humble execu|tioner. They advi&s;e, and you mo&s;t conde&s;cendingly admini&s;ter, De&s;truction. Their a&s;cendancy and your humility, their patrioti&s;m and your di&s;cernment, their wi&s;dom and your humanity, are &s;ubjects of univer&s;al admiration. But of all your mo&s;t diabolical virtues, &s;atanic Sir, the mo&s;t con&s;picuous is Hypo|cri&s;y. The blaze of it, upon one occa&s;ion, in par|ticular, the death of Lord Chancellor Yorke, (as Milton &s;ays) <HI>"far round illumin'd hell."</HI> As you can practice it &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for the de&s;olation, let me intreat you, gloomy Sir, to a&s;&s;ume it now (by way of frolic only) for the pre&s;ervation of mankind; but, above all, for your own precious intere&s;t, much
<PB N="190" REF="013989_0002_0F9258FE03262700">dearer to you than the &s;alvation of an inferior uni|ver&s;e. Your Maje&s;ty has di&s;ported your&s;elf amid&s;t the dangerous indulgencies of three mo&s;t unprincely pa&s;&s;ions; pride, anger, and revenge, for fourteen years pa&s;t; ever &s;ince the demi&s;e of our good King, George the &s;econd; in who&s;e reign your mo&s;t hy|pocritical highne&s;s was advi&s;ed to wear the ma&s;k of decency and circum&s;pection. You then ca&s;t a fa|vourable glance only at corruption; but you have &s;ince &s;purned the reign of policy, and broke out into &s;uch uncommon tyrannies, &s;uch bloody inhumani|ties, unprovoked, that your de&s;potic Highne&s;s mu&s;t now either de&s;i&s;t, or expect to be de&s;erted and de|po&s;ed. My great tenderne&s;s for two of your High|ne&s;&s;es deare&s;t friends, the Scotch Lords, Bute and Mansfield, obliges me to give you this timely notice Should you &s;till continue, dread Sir, to "have en|tire confidence in the wi&s;dom of your Divan," &s;hould you &s;till, "Steadily pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they have recommended"&mdash;your reign can be but &s;hort; your animating &s;upporters Bute, and Mansfield, mu&s;t &s;urely fail. When the&s;e helli&s;h in|&s;tigators of your pride are gone, your unhappy reign mu&s;t end, when tho&s;e arch fiends of corrup|tion and iniquity, are no more; your wi&s;e Divan, will fall off from you like water, they will neither &s;upport your wanton &s;laughter in America, nor your pious de&s;igns upon Great Britain, your faithful pen|&s;ioners will faint for want of tho&s;e heartening &s;up|plies, with which they are now daily refre&s;hed in plenteous &s;treams, by your Maje&s;ty's feeder Lord North, under the provident eye of your be&s;t &s;ub|jects, Bute and Mansfield. When the&s;e fountains of milk and honey, cea&s;e to flow, your Maje&s;ty's hired majority will grow languid and relaps into what
<PB N="191" REF="013989_0003_0F9258FED9E5F970">they once were, and ever will be, mere di&s;&s;emblers of patriotic virtue, even your &s;overeign tool of all, who now audaciou&s;ly plumes him&s;elf upon their &s;upport, will then fore&s;wear any further attachment to them, or you. When your chief agents Lord Bute and Mansfield are extinct, what mu&s;t become of ways and means, arbitrary taxation, and mo&s;t effectual methods for carrying the&s;e pregnant &s;chemes into a daring execution, by &s;word and fa|mine? Your angels, Bute and Mansfield are excel|lent at the&s;e devices; but their fervent zeal for your Highne&s;s's cau&s;e, has, at la&s;t tran&s;ported them be|yond the bounds of judgment. Call the&s;e winged hell hounds off in time, great Sir, if you value the pre&s;ervation of your de&s;potic power; and as you have hitherto played the tyrant for your plea&s;ure, begin now to play the hypocrite for your &s;afety. Should you permit the&s;e Scotch imps of yours to proceed farther, you will hazard all. We now feel certain &s;tretches of your per&s;evering powers too great for human nature, or human patience to &s;up|port long; a&s;&s;ume therefore, mo&s;t &s;teady Prince, in this dangerous Cri&s;is, a virtue to which you are, in truth, a &s;tranger. Play off, once more an appear|ance of clemency; it will be better timed now, than it ever was in the ca&s;e of Sodomites, wanton mur|derers, and military cut-throats. Di&s;&s;emble your cau&s;ele&s;s anger, and effeminate thir&s;t for blood. By this &s;tratagem you may, probably, make the ea&s;y, long &s;uffering, pa&s;&s;ive fools, whom you wi&s;h to de|&s;troy, believe that your Maje&s;ty is really &s;incere, when you conde&s;cend to call them (with inward reluctance and di&s;dain) "Your faithful and beloved people." Believe me, mo&s;t infernal Prince, this is the only way to compa&s;s their utter ruin, with the
<PB N="192" REF="013989_0004_0F9258FFB322A708">lea&s;t probable &s;ecurity to your gracious &s;elf, your wi&s;e Divan, your faithful minions, your ob&s;equious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and pen&s;ioned parricides. By the&s;e means, and by the&s;e alone, you may &s;till live in pro&s;perous and plenteous infamy. Thus, and thus only, can you hope to introduce, with &s;afety to your&s;elf, that de|&s;tructive plan of tyranny, by which your beloved Bute and Mansfield, will immortalize your reign. It mu&s;t be introduced, my Prince, by gentle, &s;low de|grees. By your obdurate &s;teadine&s;s, and precipitate per&s;everance (virtues not unworthy of a Devil) your darling &s;chemes may be &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed, be|fore you can have time to declare again how much you are a&s;toni&s;hed at tho&s;e &s;ufferers, who de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t you as much as</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My <HI>Lords,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hips will pardon me, and I am &s;ure your brother North will readily excu&s;e me, if I pa&s;s him by, for the pre&s;ent, as a mere expletive in your execrable triumvirate. He is, in truth, my Lords, (and the world &s;ees it) no more than the o&s;ten&s;ible leader of that fawning, fal&s;e, corrupt con|federacy, who arrogantly groupe them&s;elves under the &s;pecious name of King's friends. Like de&s;ign|ing traytors, they, and you, my Lords, a&s;&s;ume this ma&s;k for the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es; that of enriching your wretched &s;elves, by the &s;poils of this unhappy country; whil&s;t your deluded, pa&s;&s;ive Sovereign, is but your &s;talking hor&s;e. Poor, mean, ob&s;equious, flexible Lord North, (like the re&s;t of your &s;ervile herd) is no more than the humble and callous exe|cutioner
<PB N="193" REF="013989_0005_0F9259007B0F2400">of your infernal &s;elfi&s;h views, your inhu|man warrants, your de&s;tructive bloody policy. In a word my Lords, you are the &s;ubtiles, and he is the face.</P>
<P>To your Lord&s;hips, therefore, and to your Lord|&s;hips only, as principals, as the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t in|defatigable deluders of weak and ductile Maje&s;ty; I now addre&s;s my&s;elf, not in terms of plea&s;ing flat|tery, but in the rough, and odious language of di&s;|gu&s;ting Truth. Such, my Lords, as the Sovereign is, the nation has received him from your hands. He was born a Briton; you, my Lords, have taught him not only to forget, but to &s;hame his birth. He was born a Prince; you have levelled him with the wor&s;t, the mo&s;t inhuman, and meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects. He became (too &s;oon alas!) a King; you, my Lords, have deba&s;ed him to a tyrant. His mind, though enligtened by no au&s;picious ray from heaven, was yet capable of receiving &s;ome moderate degrees of culture; it was in its infant &s;tate, open at lea&s;t to the impre&s;&s;ions of humanity; you, my Lords, in that early period, gave it a mo&s;t unhappy bent; you moulded, you contracted, you &s;teeled it, for your own wicked purpo&s;es. To &s;ay the be&s;t of it, it remains, after all your painful lectures, either to|tally unprincipled, or mo&s;t attrociou&s;ly perverted. Hence, my patriotic Lords, have flowed (and &s;till flow) all the grievances of the pre&s;ent inglorious, ignoble, and inhuman reign. Let me ring them in your ears, my Lords:&mdash;Court&mdash;and Mini&s;terial A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, of which Martyn, Dun, and Talbot, can remind you, in Wilkes's ca&s;e. In the &s;ame ca&s;e, in Bingley's and &s;ome others, royal per&s;ecutions, Star Chamber inqui&s;itions, era&s;ing records, inveigling, bya&s;&s;ing, mi&s;leading, deceiving, over-bearing, and
<PB N="194" REF="013989_0006_0F9259011171FCF8">even packing juries, by Lord Mansfield. Daring corruptions and perver&s;ions of ju&s;tice, by the &s;ame hand, in the la&s;t re&s;ort (the once righteous hou&s;e of Lords) in the late ca&s;e of Thickne&s;s and Leigh, un|der the infamous, illegal, and unprecedented con|duct of Lord Ap&s;ley, Lord Mansfield, Lord High Chancellor of Great-Britain. The unju&s;t proceed|ings in this ca&s;e will (to your immortal infamy, Lord Mansfield) be handed down to the late&s;t po&s;terity&mdash;even a Jeffereys would have blu&s;hed at them. As for your &s;hadow, Ap&s;ley; your dependant Scots, Carthcart and Galloway, and your bully Denbigh, they are but tools in your Lord&s;hip's craft, they live by the breath of your Lord&s;hip's no&s;trils, and are too incon&s;iderable to be named either by hi&s;torian or reporter; but Lord Mansfield's name and doc|trines will be faithfully recorded.&mdash;Now, my Lords, I return to grievances, the offspring of your Scotch politics. Among others, you may recollect the vi|olation of the freedom of election, and the lives you have to an&s;wer for at the Middle&s;ex election, in &s;upport of your court tool, Sir William Beauchamp Proctor. Your Lord&s;hips, and your royal pupil, countenanced a &s;till greater violation of the rights of election, which was mo&s;t impudently and perfi|diou&s;ly avowed, and &s;anctified by a corrupt Hou&s;e of Commons, in the ca&s;e of that in&s;ignificant time &s;erver, Col. Luttrel, the King's brother in law. Let me now remind your Lord&s;hips (for you are too callous to be &s;hocked with the &s;ound) of Murders (repeated, wanton murders) at the Brentford election, and in St. George's fields, even of Women and Chil|ren. The barbarous carnage of young Allen (naked and unarmed) mu&s;t be attoned for. By who&s;e ad|vi&s;e, and with who&s;e privity, my Lords, did your
<PB N="195" REF="013989_0007_0F925901C980C510">Pupil return public thanks for this &s;laughter of his &s;ubjects; who in the one ca&s;e were but curious gazers, and in the other, were di&s;charging their duties as hone&s;t, independent electors, above mini|&s;terial bribery and corruption? let me a&s;k you, my Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England (who&s;e duty it was to bring the&s;e mini&s;terial cut-throats to condign puni&s;hment) why were the&s;e guilty mi&s;creants &s;creened, protected, pardoned, pen&s;ioned? Why and by who&s;e orders (unle&s;s yours, my Lord) was &s;o much affected tenderne&s;s, manage|ment, brow-beating of the pro&s;ecutor's councils and witne&s;&s;es, &s;uch nice caution in &s;umming up the evi|dence, &s;uch menaces again&s;t tho&s;e who dare to print the&s;e public trials, but particularly that of young Allen? why did your Lord&s;hip's upright, holy, and favourite judge, Smythe, &s;o &s;ignalize him&s;elf, and la|bour with &s;uch uncommon partiality? why were the laws of England, di&s;penced with in the ca&s;e of the military Scotch ruffians, who &s;pilled the innocent blood of Allen in St. George's Fields? who &s;ugge&s;ted the happy thought of di&s;&s;olving the la&s;t Parliament on a &s;udden, and of &s;muggling and packing (by means of private in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters">ions to the Court-Members) a corrupt majority in the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons in &s;upport of the ruinous and de&s;po|tic plan laid by your Lord&s;hips, and carried on by your ob&s;equious in&s;trument Lord North, and his pen&s;ionary &s;ubalterns in both Hou&s;es of Parliament? How, and by whom, are the Seats of Ju&s;tice to be filled for the future, my Lords, and for what purpo&s;es? I will not a&s;k, what knowledge of the laws, but what intere&s;t, what rea&s;ons, made &s;uch a man as Hotham, a Baron of the exchequer? This is a new grievance and a real one.</P>

Of all your other wicked coun&s;els, what impolitic, diabolical &s;pirit, could in&s;tigate you to advi&s;e your pupil ever to con&s;ent to, much more to per&s;evere, in the inhuman ma&s;&s;acre of Ame|rica? Why were the petitions of the city of London, an|&s;wered in your reign, my Lords, with &s;neers, in&s;ults, abu&s;e, menaces, indignant frowns, and even with accu&s;ations of high trea&s;on? I refer your Lord&s;hips to your la&s;t Ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">aw-like an&s;wer to the city petition, where you will find, to the general a&s;toni&s;hment, that you have almo&s;t impeached a part of his Majesty's faithful and beloved people, of high trea&s;on, for only making a con&s;titutional &s;upplication to the throne for humbly remon&s;trating again&s;t the pernicious influence of corruption and your lord&s;hips, and for expre&s;&s;ing natural and just feelings for their fellow &s;ubjects, doomed by your lord|&s;hips to de&s;truction in America.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e my Lords, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t palpable wounds which your Lord&s;hips have, by hirelings and dupes, already given, there are others in Embryo, which you are about to give to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. For the&s;e iniquities, when your mea&s;ure is full, my Lords, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly account at la&s;t, unle&s;s, like true cowards, you fly from pub|lic ju&s;tice, or di&s;appoint the meritorious executioner, by the timely application of your own guilty hands, to the rottenne&s;t and mo&s;t dete&s;ted hearts that ever beat. If murdering innocence and virtue, in the &s;ubject, and ex|tingui&s;hing their influence in the &s;overeign, is tyranny and trea&s;on, and rank cowardice, I am no fal&s;e accu&s;er of your Lord&s;hips. The in&s;tances I have already given are &s;uch as would blacken the reigns of a Nero, or Domi|tian, but they are &s;uch my Lords as &s;prung naturally from tho&s;e internal in&s;titutes which your Lord&s;hips have ince&s;&s;antly penned and preached, for the Edification of a Briti&s;h King; of a King; who neither does, nor po&s;&s;ibly can, hold the crown of England upon &s;uch principles as your Lord&s;hips have laboured to in&s;till, the&s;e labours, my Lords, are crying &s;ins again&s;t the liberties, and Maje&s;ty of the nation, and the wages of the&s;e &s;ins is death.</P>
