<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have lately written, pronounced and publi&s;hed an oration, which you denominate "Con|necticut Republicani&s;m." How well it de&s;erves this title, will be clearly &s;een in the following pages.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may feel flattered, <HI>(if Mr. Bi&s;hop be &s;u&s;ceptible of flattery)</HI> that this oration has been the &s;ubject of &s;o much notoriety; but you will plea&s;e to recollect that great and good productions frequently excite le&s;s attention than tho&s;e which are mi&s;chievous and mon&s;trous. This is true in the nat|ural, as well as the moral and political world. A rattle-&s;nake, or an African tyger would doubtle&s;s be an object of as much curio&s;ity, in the city of New-Haven, as the mo&s;t beautiful bird, or an ele|gant Arabian hor&s;e; and an ourang-outang would draw together more &s;pectators, than the mo&s;t fin|i&s;hed of our race.</P>
<P>Nor ought you to take much pride from the con&s;ideration that you have already felt one "rod for the fool's back," from a di&s;tingui&s;hed citizen of New-Haven, and that others will probably &s;ucceed to open the wounds afre&s;h. Remember, Sir, that the learned Bi&s;hop Wat&s;on addre&s;&s;ed &s;everal letters to your fellow-labourer, Thomas Paine; and if tho&s;e who attack you may not equal that pious di|vine,
<PB N="4" REF="037281_0003_100CAA5FC878EE18">yet they do not fall farther below him, than you do, in talents, below that &s;trolling preacher of Jacobini&s;m&mdash;that bla&s;phemer again&s;t religion and its divine author.</P>
<P>If a Bedlamite loo&s;ed from his fetters &s;hould at|tempt to fire our buildings by night, he need take no con&s;olation to him&s;elf that wi&s;e and great men were engaged to &s;top his career of madne&s;s, and to chain him to a &s;pot where his capacity of doing mi&s;chief, might be ended.</P>
<P>With the&s;e views I beg you to feel as little eleva|tion of &s;pirit at the notice taken of you as the ca&s;e will warrant; and I apprehend you will find no more ju&s;t cau&s;e of boa&s;ting, than your brother Holt has for being publicly <HI>noticed,</HI> tried, fined and impri&s;oned for libelling the government of his country.</P>
<P>One great object of your Oration appears to be to effectuate a thorough change of men and mea&s;|ures in our general and particular governments; and to produce a total reformation among the peo|ple of this peaceful and happy &s;tate, in managing their important political concerns. I am then to con&s;ider you, Abraham Bi&s;hop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as &s;etting your|&s;elf up as a <HI>reformer</HI>&mdash;a reformer of the manners of Connecticut.&mdash;I am indeed <HI>&s;mitten</HI> with the thought: but A. Bi&s;hop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> has <HI>indeed</HI> a&s;&s;umed this great and arduous duty. He has indeed <HI>kindly</HI> offered him&s;elf as the guide of the <HI>deluded</HI> citizens of Con|necticut: And this is offered <HI>gratis</HI> too; no fee is demanded. You in&s;truct, advi&s;e, coun&s;el, and ex|hort <HI>gratis.</HI>&mdash;Never before, I believe, was you found <HI>laboring</HI> for the <HI>good</HI> of your neighbours, without reward or <HI>expectation of reward:</HI> whether you are now <HI>&s;o</HI> found, I will hereafter enquire.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Republican, I wi&s;h to know what prem|ten&s;ions you have to commence a <HI>reformer?</HI> You
<PB N="5" REF="037281_0004_100CAA61E68B91A8">do not <HI>prefe&s;s</HI> to be the <HI>agent</HI> of others&mdash;you appear in your <HI>proper</HI> per&s;on, and hold up Abraham Bi&s;hop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of New-Haven, as a REFORMER. This being the ca&s;e I am con&s;trained to tell you that &s;everal quali|ties will be <HI>certainly</HI> u&s;eful, which you <HI>certainly</HI> do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, unle&s;s you have received them &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw you.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. A reformer &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s good <HI>talenis.</HI> Men will not be induced to relinqui&s;h all their an|cient habits and remove their confidence from all tho&s;e in power, except from pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, or unle&s;s, &s;wayed and diverted by &s;uperior &s;kill. Now, &s;ir, no per&s;on ever deemed you a man of &s;olid, u&s;e|ful good &s;en&s;e. You, &s;ometimes amu&s;e with fla&s;hes of wit and brilliancy; but <HI>they</HI> are tran&s;ient, and an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a "dim taper in a di&s;mal cav|ern, viz. to increa&s;e the horrors of the darkne&s;s." Such a man never will be &s;ought as a guide.&mdash;Sober people will never leave old and tried coun&s;ellors and adhere to &s;uch vi&s;ionaries. As well might you expect that the traveller would reject the plain and beaten road, enlightened by the &s;un, and enter a di&s;mal &s;wamp to follow a <HI>Jack-with-a-lantern.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Stability and uniformity are e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tics of a wi&s;e man&mdash;a man to be confi|ded in as a <HI>reformer.</HI> Your in&s;tability and de&s;titution of uniformity, except in one or two particulars which I will directly mention, have, long &s;ince, been proverbial. About twenty years &s;ince you began to exhibt your&s;elf on the theatre of life as a writer in a public office. From that period to this, you have a&s;&s;umed and attempted to perform all the characters of a lawyer&mdash;a traveller&mdash;a pedagogue&mdash;a lecturer on morality&mdash;an in&s;tructor in oratory&mdash;a church Prie&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was only an <HI>attempt</HI> for you could not get orders.</NOTE> &mdash;a clerk of courts&mdash;a county fur|veyor&mdash;a &s;peculator in various kinds of land&mdash;a
<PB N="6" REF="037281_0008_100CAA64D3E20AC8">gardner, and <HI>now a preacher of &s;edition.</HI> Nor have your <HI>political opinions</HI> been more fixed. About ten years &s;ince you wrote, publi&s;hed, and preached wherever you could get hearers, again&s;t the new con&s;titution. For this Wm. Hillhou&s;e, jun. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> admini&s;tered to you a public cha&s;ti&s;ement, which, I fancy, you yet feel. For &s;everal &s;ucceeding years, you was con&s;tantly whining and murmuring again&s;t government in all its departments. In 1798, being in que&s;t of an office, you explicitly and publicly changed your &s;entiments; and thus became clerk of the Superior Court.</P>
<P>The exceptions to this part of your character are, that for ten or twelve years pa&s;t, you have been uncea&s;ingly employed in pouring all manner of abu&s;e on the Clergy and on the leading doc|trines of Chri&s;tianity. For this purpo&s;e, about ten years &s;ince, you appeared &s;everal times on public &s;tages, exhibiting the mountebank tricks of a jug|gler, and propagating &s;entiments tending to de&s;troy the confidence of the people in the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>You have al&s;o been uniform in your abu&s;e of all men in power&mdash;all lawyers&mdash;all merchants, and all the clergy, with the exception of <HI>one,</HI> to whom you have <HI>too often</HI> given the <HI>fraternal embrace</HI> for his own honor, and for the peace and harmony of his &s;ociety.</P>
<P>What in&s;tance can be produced of your applau&s;e of an individual? Of whom have you &s;poken, at any time, except to tarni&s;h his fame with your calum|niating and pe&s;tilential breath? What neighbour&mdash;what fellow-citizen have you not attempted to ridicule and blackguard? And it is a remmarka|ble fact that in an oration of 64 pages, with a preface, notes and an appendix, you &s;hould have charged the gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes on our merchants&mdash;our men of property&mdash;our lawyers&mdash;our officers from
<PB N="7" REF="037281_0005_100CAA665A369628">the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t&mdash;our Clergy with all who adhere to them; and that in this va&s;t collection of &s;landerous things, not one word of applau&s;e&mdash;nay not one word of excu&s;e or palliation for their con|duct or motives, &s;hould have e&s;caped your lips, except that you have &s;elected about ten democrats with Mr. Jeffer&s;on at their head, and paid them a <HI>&s;mall</HI> compliment in a note.</P>
<P>Thirdly. To be a &s;ucce&s;sful reformer you ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence of the people. To this you have no claim. Never have you holden any office by the &s;uffrages of your fellow citizens&mdash;never did you receive any appointment except in con&s;equence of the character and &s;tation of your father, as I will demon&s;trate in another place.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, Mr. Bi&s;hop, how could you expect to make one pro&s;elyte by your Oration? With this weight <HI>on</HI> your character, and without any weight <HI>of</HI> character, you might rationally have anticipated that <HI>chagrin</HI> which now unfits you for bu&s;ine&s;s; but could hope for no other elevation than to make you "a fixed figure for the hand of &s;corn to point his &s;low and moving finger at."</P>
<P>The <HI>manner,</HI> Sir, in which this Oration was u&s;h|ered upon the public, demands con&s;ideration. A &s;ociety of Yale-College, in&s;tituted for the promo|tion of friend&s;hip and &s;cience, elected you their an|niver&s;ary orator. They were entirely ignorant that when you was Pre&s;ident of that &s;ociety, a com|mittee was appointed to &s;olicit you to re&s;ign the of|fice, on account of your profanity; and that you yielded to the &s;olicitation, rather than hazard an ex|pul&s;ion. They were al&s;o without a &s;u&s;picion, that you were &s;o faithle&s;s as to pronounce an Oration at <HI>their reque&s;t,</HI> directly attacking all the venerable in|&s;titutions of Connecticut, and in pointed oppo&s;ition to principles which they deemed &s;acred. Much le&s;s could they have conjectured that you could have
<PB N="8" REF="037281_0007_100CAA6AC615C510">cau&s;ed it to be printed without their &s;anction. Per|ceiving that your effrontery had over-leaped all the bounds of decency, they met and voted to di&s;pen&s;e with the Oration. Still you per&s;i&s;ted in declaim|ing: and thus you <HI>palmed</HI> on the world this hete|rogeneous production.</P>
<P>Reflect al&s;o, Sir, that for &s;everal years pa&s;t the &s;tudents of Yale-College have occupied the eve|ning preceding the commencement, by public &s;peaking in the brick meeting-hou&s;e.&mdash;That on this occa&s;ion the members and officers of that univer&s;i|ty &mdash;the literary gentlemen&mdash;the friends and con|nections of the &s;cholars with a brilliant and re&s;pect|able audience, a&s;&s;emble. All this you knew. How extremely uncivil&mdash;how ungentlemanly was it then for you to attempt to interrupt tho&s;e &s;tated and ben|eficial exerci&s;es by your rant and non&s;en&s;e? Sup|po&s;e, Sir, when an audience is a&s;&s;embled to cele|brate the 4th of July&mdash;to lament the death of Gen. Wa&s;hington, or to commemorate any other great event, a <HI>quack</HI> in medicine, &s;hould erect a &s;tage contiguous to &s;uch a congregation, and there deal out his no&s;trums and pre&s;criptions, with the vain glory, common to Empirics&mdash;what would de|cent and &s;ober men &s;ay of &s;uch a Quack? How would they &s;purn at his ribaldry? How would they de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a low, ill-bred, indecorous mountebank? And yet where lies the difference between a Quack in medicine and a Quack in politics&mdash;between a <HI>juggling pretender</HI> to cure all di&s;ea&s;es of the human body, and a <HI>juggling projector</HI> of cures for the body politic.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Oration.&mdash;It is extremely obvious that all your a&s;&s;ertions and comments on facts, with your various rhap&s;odical prophecies, ejaculations and lamentations, are idle and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s that <HI>political delu&s;ion</HI> exi&s;ts on which you have profe&s;&s;edly built. Now, Sir, what proof have
<PB N="9" REF="037281_0007_100CAA6AC615C510">you offered of this <HI>delu&s;ion?</HI> The good people of the United States, and particularly of Connecticut, are earne&s;ty &s;olicited to believe (and threatened with heavy cur&s;es in ca&s;e of their unbelief) that all tho&s;e who acquie&s;ce in the admini&s;tration of our government are poor, mi&s;guided, <HI>deluded</HI> wretches, rapidly approaching to a &s;tate of idiocy or di&s;trac|tion: and the te&s;timony adduced in &s;upport of the idea is, that A. Bi&s;hop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a re&s;tle&s;s, chagrined and ambitious declaimer, a&s;&s;ures them that this is their condition. The people, Sir, will requite more evidence. The force of tropes and figures&mdash;of rant and railing, will be in&s;ufficient to un&s;ettle the public mind, and to de&s;troy that &s;tate of things which re&s;ts on experience, reflection and convic|tion. As well might you expect to compel a Chri&s;|tian to exchange his ideas of the pure joys of heav|en for the gro&s;s impurities of a Mahometan para|di&s;e, as that an open oppo&s;er of principles &s;upport|ed by the &s;anction of ages, &s;hould produce a&s;&s;ent to his wild reveries in politics&mdash;his motley and mon|grel &s;y&s;tems of government. In&s;tead, Sir, of wri|ting, &s;peakhig and di&s;per&s;ing this oration, you might have arrayed your&s;elf in the Harlequin dre&s;s of an ancient <HI>tru&s;ader</HI> in religion, or a modern <HI>Quixotte</HI> in chivalry, and at midnight, have gone through the &s;treets of New-Haven, with lighted matches in your hands, attempting to &s;et on fire the hou&s;es of the citizens le&s;t they &s;hould fall and bury in ruins the families which inhabit them.&mdash;Methinks, I &s;ee you thus equipped, enter the dwel|ling of your neighbour, and I hear you thus ad|dre&s;s the family, "I am come as your friend, to &s;et on fire this building.&mdash;I know that it appears &s;trong, neat and elegant, but I have di&s;covered, by my own genius and the aid of other incendiaries, that this appearance is all <HI>delu&s;ion,</HI> and that it will &s;oon fall and cru&s;h every individual to death.&mdash;Know ye not, ye children and dome&s;tics, that one

On very &s;abbath they follow u to church, and we verily believe that we are becoming wi&s;er and better. No complaint hath yet been heard within the&s;e walls, we are re&s;trained of no rational liberty and we fear no mi&s;chief. Pray, Mr. Bi&s;hop leave us to our&s;elves,&mdash;if we are indeed <HI>deluded,</HI> we are happy in the <HI>delu&s;ion.</HI>"&mdash;You, with an inflamed countenance, go on, "Children and &s;er|vants, "the&s;e are delution's <HI>handy works.</HI>"&mdash;I am bound by the love and <HI>fraternity</HI> I bear you, to de|clare that this your father and ma&s;ter, who has ju&s;t now &s;poken, is <HI>one</HI> of this <HI>combination</HI> to de&s;troy you.

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, Sir, I will not deal with you &s;imply in general ob&s;ervations. I will &s;urvey your beloved, though mi&s;s-&s;hapen and ill-begotten child, in all its features and point out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">You will ob&s;erve I treat it as ma&s;culine, not from its &s;trength but becau&s;e I would not in&s;ult the ladies by calling it feminine.</NOTE> <HI>his</HI> predominant character|i&s;tics.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037281_0011_100CAA724B9A8138">
In your preface you a&s;&s;ert, in paragraph 4th, that it is well known that, in 1787, a number of our leading men were holding meetings to e&s;tabli&s;h a confederated monarchy.&mdash;That the &s;peech of Gen. Hamilton in the convention, favoured the &s;ame ob|ject.&mdash;That our leading men avow that this coun|try can never be governed without an hereditary monarch.&mdash;That appropriate plans, of monarchy are adopted by admini&s;tration. That our federal papers are filled with reflections on liberty and repub|licani&s;m, and that Fenno is the mouth piece of fed|erali&s;m.&mdash;Now, &s;ir, the&s;e are naked a&s;&s;ections. I, in reply, &s;ay that each of them is fal&s;e. It belongs to you to prove them; and if truth had been your aim you would have furni&s;hed that proof, or have omitted them. One of your a&s;&s;ertions, viz. <HI>that,</HI> re&s;pecting federal papers, I agree, is to &s;tand or fall, by recurring to tho&s;e papers. And here, &s;ir, I challenge you to produce a new&s;paper publi&s;hed in New-England or to the &s;outhward of New-Eng|land, excepting Fenno's and Porcupine's, (which you know have not been for years either read or patronized by federali&s;ts generally) which con|tains a reflection on liberty or republicani&s;m, or a &s;yllable in favour of monarchy. I a&s;&s;ert that no &s;uch paper can be found.</P>
<P>In the 2d, page of this preface, after having &s;aid that a monarchy is decidedly before us, and having mentioned the rea&s;ons for the a&s;&s;ertion, you have the following ob&s;ervation, "The men now in place, have been the contrivers or advocates of the&s;e mea&s;ures." This is a plain declaration that <HI>all</HI> men now holding offices in the national or &s;tate gov|ernments, are either the contrivers or advocates of monarchy. You know; you knew, when you penned that &s;entence, that it was not only fal&s;e, but an <HI>infa|mous fal&s;hood.</HI> The&s;e men have all <HI>&s;worn</HI> &s;o &s;upport a <HI>republican</HI> government&mdash;you then charge them with perjury&mdash;with trea&s;on! with <HI>contriving</HI> to de&s;troy
<PB N="13" REF="037281_0012_100CAA740FB96BD0">that con&s;titution under which they live and to which they have bound them&s;elves by an appeal to heaven. Think, &s;ir, what it is for A. Bi&s;hop, to charge all the men in office in the United States, with the&s;e flagitious crimes!</P>
<P>In the 6th paragraph of this preface you tell us of the wonder with which our &s;outhern brethren view the ari&s;tocracy of Connecticut and a&s;cribe this ari&s;tocracy to what you term "federal policy" and refer us to your appendix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 7th page of appendix.</NOTE> for the proof.</P>
<P>On this paragraph I remark, fir&s;t that your pro|po&s;ition re&s;pectiong <HI>your</HI> &s;outhern brethren is not quite accurately &s;teted. It &s;hould read thus, "Our fellow labourers in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of de&s;troying order and religion, behold with fear and anger that happy &s;tate of &s;ociety which prevails in Con|necticut, and which has erected &s;uch impregnable bulwarks again&s;t our attacks on all the venerable in&s;titutions in the United States." Such a reading is much more con&s;onant to the real &s;tate of things; and is conformable to they ideas of all &s;ober people.</P>
<P>I remark &s;econdly, How could your evil genius lead you to a&s;cribe the uniformity and &s;tability of our elections to <HI>"federal policy?"</HI> Know you not, that the practice of placing coun&s;ellors on the nomina|tion li&s;t, according to <HI>&s;eniority</HI> and without regard to the <HI>number of votes,</HI> provided they are of the fir&s;t twenty, has been uniformly adhered to, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the &s;tate? And do you not al|&s;o know that this rule is never applied to the nomi|nation for Congre&s;s? Why then term it "<HI>federal</HI> policy?" Why but to mi&s;lead, confu&s;e and en&s;nare; which appears to be the great bu&s;ine&s;s of your life?</P>
<P>In the 8th paragraph of this preface you &s;ay, "For eleven years freedom of the pre&s;s and of
<PB N="14" REF="037281_0013_100CAA7596428068">opinion have been re&s;trained?" What do you mean? Within this period you and others have been per|mitted to &s;peak, write, and publi&s;h all the abu&s;ive things which malignant hearts could invent, or noi|&s;y tongues utter, on every &s;ubject which you and they cho&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s; and hitherto there hath been but <HI>one</HI> pro&s;ecution in this &s;tate, though I confe&s;s <HI>there ought to have been many.</HI> Nay is not the pro|mulgation of your Oration, irre&s;i&s;tible proof that, not only liberty, but <HI>alarming licentiou&s;ue&s;s</HI> of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s, exi&s;ts? What farther indulgence does a <HI>good man</HI> wi&s;h than to &s;peak the <HI>truth</HI>&mdash;what greater do <HI>you</HI> wi&s;h than to charge every great and good man with the mo&s;t ba&s;e and dete&s;tible crimes? If you would have more &s;lander abound, you mu&s;t have a &s;econd <HI>apo&s;tacy,</HI> at lea&s;t as great as the fir&s;t, and a new dictionary of abu&s;ive words.</P>
<P>In your redoubtable attack on our commercial &s;y&s;tem, you appear to have two objects in view, viz. fir&s;t to de&s;troy the reputation of merchants; and &s;econdly to beggar them and all tho&s;e immedi|ately connected with them.</P>
<P>To effect the fir&s;t object you &s;ay pages 3d, and 9th, that commerce cannot &s;upport it&s;elf&mdash;that it is not worth what it co&s;ts&mdash;that our merchants <HI>know</HI> this, but that they are lending their aid to the pro|pagation and belief of a <HI>forged &s;tory,</HI> becau&s;e it is beneficial to them; and that this their aid is afford|ed upon the &s;ame principle that a gang of counter|feiters give currency to a "well counterfeited bill 'till by accident the deceit is di&s;covered, by which time the counterfeiter has gained all his ends."&mdash;You had before charged "men in place" with per|jury and trea&s;on: Here you charge merchants, "every well informed merchant," with giving that &s;pecies of aid to a fal&s;e and forged &s;tory, "becau&s;e it is beneficial to him," which forgers and coun|terfeiters give to a fal&s;e and forged bank note. And
<PB N="15" REF="037281_0014_100CAA7927566B58">is it indeed true that gentlemen who have &s;u&s;tained irreproachable characters through life&mdash;gentlemen, who have never before been <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of want of integrity&mdash;gentlemen who retain an elevated rank in &s;ociety for their fairne&s;s, punctuality, and hon|or, &s;hould be arraigned, in a body, before the tri|bunal of the public, and there charged with &s;uch infamous conduct? Merchants are indeed attached to the government of their country; but are they, on this account, to &s;uller &s;uch calumny?</P>
<P>Another object with you is to beggar the&s;e merch|ants and all tho&s;e dependent on commerce. And why? Becau&s;e you think commerce u&s;ele&s;s and de|&s;tructive. On this part of the &s;ubject you have been &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by the Pamphlet to which I have already alluded.&mdash;I will add that it has been an object with the&s;e &s;tates, for more than a century, to encourage and protect commerce. Great, wi&s;e, and good men, of all parties, with <HI>few</HI> exceptions, have concurred in opinion on this &s;ubject, and it is <HI>rather too late,</HI> for a fool or a mad-man to per&s;uade the United States to abandon this &s;ource of great|ne&s;s, wealth, and re&s;pectability. But your &s;y&s;tem of oppo&s;ition to commerce is built on the propo&s;i|tion that foreign nations will come to our ports, bring us their produce and take ours, on equally good terms with tho&s;e now afforded by our merchants. And are you indeed &s;o &s;tupid as not to &s;ee that tho&s;e nations either in their purcha&s;es of us, or &s;ales to us, will make us pay for protecting this trade? And may we not pay our own farmers, mechanics, &s;ea|ment and merchants as well as tho&s;e of other na|tions? Mr. Bi&s;hop pray attend to tho&s;e things with which you are conver&s;ant.&mdash;The people of New-Haven will certainly prefer the opinion of &s;uch men as I&s;aac Beers and Elias Shipman on this &s;ubject to yours, although they may allow you, as County Surveyor, to mea&s;ure their Wad with your <HI>"four rod chain."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037281_0015_100CAA7AAFB54990">
Again, you &s;ay, in pages 6th, and 7th, exten|&s;ive commerce makes a great bu&s;tle of wealth&mdash;&s;ome large fortunes&mdash;many bankruptcies&mdash;and you add with a view to inflame the public mind, that <HI>farmers</HI> loo&s;e their debts by the&s;e bankruptcies&mdash;that mortgages abound more on our records&mdash;and that the people, "including public and private indebt|edne&s;s," are more deeply involved, than at any &s;ea&s;on before.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting "public indebtedne&s;s" to the Uni|ted States, if Mr. Secretary Wolcott is to be cred|ited before Albert Gallatin and his puffer A. Bi&s;h|op, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and I fancy that tho&s;e who know the characters will <HI>judge accurately,</HI> the debt is reduced, in eleven years, almo&s;t four millions of dollars: and this too, notwith&s;tanding, millions have been expended in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;urrection which Mr. Gallatin contributed to produce, and in protecting our commerce from the ravages of that nation, who&s;e prai&s;es, you and he, are ince&s;&s;antly chaunt|ing.</P>
<P>It may be further remarked that Connecticut was <HI>then</HI> indebted to an amount of nearly two mill|ions of dollars, from which &s;he is now di&s;charged, excepting about twelve thou&s;and dollars; and has, <HI>in her trea&s;ury,</HI> almo&s;t two millions: and this <HI>mighty</HI> change has been effected by certain <HI>"operations of federal policy,"</HI> &s;uch as the funding &s;y&s;tem, the a&s;|&s;umption of &s;tate debts, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Thus far of your <HI>"public indebtedne&s;s."</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;pecting "private indebtedne&s;s" you have made &s;everal &s;hamele&s;s a&s;&s;ertions.&mdash;Do our farmers <HI>&s;uffer</HI> by the bankruptcies of merchants? You know that the farmers, either give &s;hort credit or receive the ca&s;h.&mdash;They will ju&s;tify me in &s;aying, that at no former period could they obtain &s;uck advanta|geous
<PB N="17" REF="037281_0016_100CAA7CD4833C68">&s;ales of their produce, and receive &s;uch &s;ati&s;|factory payments.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay "mortgages abound."&mdash;If, I here admit that you &s;peak the truth, what follows? If in con&s;equence of the immen&s;e &s;peculations, a de|gree of di&s;tru&s;t is created and mete are therefore more cautious in taking &s;ecurity, is it certain that there is more indebtedne&s;s? Or if more indebted|ne&s;s, are the people impoveri&s;hing? Do you think New-York, Hartford and New-Haven are more op|pulent now than at the beginning of this century? You mu&s;t &s;ay, yes&mdash;but <HI>mortgages</HI> more abound, and there is <HI>far</HI> more <HI>indebtedne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Indu&s;try, en|terpri&s;e and exertion will produce great commercial operations&mdash;<HI>indebtedne&s;s,</HI> to a certain extent, will be the con&s;equence, but this is no argument of pov|erty, or a decline in wealth.&mdash;A&s;k the lawyers and judges of courts and look at your own records and &s;ay, if you can do it without a blu&s;h, what is the difference in the number of &s;uits now in&s;tituted for debt in one year, and in the years 1786 and 1787.&mdash;You know that the compari&s;on will &s;how that you "have erred and loved to err."&mdash;Then, the people could not pay&mdash;officers could not collect&mdash;con&s;equently &s;uits were multiplied to an alarming degree. In 1786 more &s;uits were in&s;tituted for debt in the counties of Hartford and New-Haven, and I pre&s;ume in the other counties, than in the three la&s;t years.</P>
<P>Again. Our farmers are now full of money&mdash;their produce every where commands ca&s;h. The face of the country&mdash;public and private buildings&mdash;the dre&s;s of the citizens&mdash;roads and bridges and every other object pre&s;ents marks of growing wealth and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t meet your <HI>logical</HI> rea&s;oning. You &s;eem to admit in page 6th that there is this
<PB N="18" REF="037281_0017_100CAA800EDC94A8">thrift&mdash;the&s;e evidences of wealth; but then you &s;ay "Individuals appear to the world mo&s;t thrifty when they are mo&s;t thriftily expending their mort|gaged e&s;tates." What does this rea&s;oning prove? The inference is clear, if a country exhibits every po&s;&s;ible proof of riches, depend on it <HI>that</HI> country is <HI>rapidly declining.</HI> If the eye of the benevolent traveller meets, in every village, &s;pacious fields well fenced, good hou&s;es&mdash;elegant public buildings, hand&s;ome carriages and well dre&s;&s;ed inhabitants, he heaves a deep &s;igh, drops a tear and exclaims, "Oh what marks of poverty and wretchedne&s;s! Poor <HI>deluded</HI> people&mdash;rapidly going to de&s;truction! OH DELUSION!&mdash;DELUSION OH"!! This &s;ame traveller, in another country, beholds a race of people hou&s;ele&s;s, or in log-huts&mdash;pennyle&s;s and in rags, &s;hivering with the cold and pre&s;enting meagre faces, and &s;ings "Oh my country&mdash;MY country. &mdash;This is indeed <HI>Boon&mdash;Boon&mdash;Oh the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 6th and 4th line from the top.</NOTE> <HI>length and depth of Mr. Bi&s;hop's oration</HI>"!!</P>
<P>This is your logic, Sir, and I only wi&s;h to enquire whether you learned it in your travels through <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>I omit here to notice the gro&s;s charges which you bring again&s;t all <HI>bank directors</HI> in the note to your 5th page, becau&s;e to de&s;ignate particularly the ob|jects of your abu&s;e, would be to &s;peak of every man and character which you notice, democrats, jacobins and infidels excepted.</P>
<P>In your remarks on the commercial &s;y&s;tem, you have with an air of malicious triumph mentioned the tribute which the United States pay to the Dey of Algiers. Did you not know, Sir, that this is the only method by which any nation can procure peace with tho&s;e lawle&s;s pirates?&mdash;Did you not
<PB N="19" REF="037281_0018_100CAA819625FBA0">know that your brother democrats con&s;tantly pour|ed contempt on the government, 'till this tribute was paid: and that appeals, through every Jacobin paper, were made to the compa&s;&s;ion of our citizens, in favor of fathers, hu&s;bands and &s;ons, &s;uffering cruel bondage in that country? Do you, Sir, now in&s;ult your nation for re&s;cuing from chains of en|during &s;ervitude, Americans in Algiers?</P>
<P>You al&s;o clamour greatly, becau&s;e our hou&s;es and lands are mortgaged to pay our debts. Were not our hou&s;es and lands always thus mortgaged? Is not every man's property &s;acredly pledged, by laws paramount to tho&s;e which govern mortgages, for the payment of what he owes? And will any but rogues ever complain that their property is thus pledged?</P>
<P>Your attack on the naval and military &s;y&s;tems, contains nothing but what has been repeatedly &s;aild (and much better &s;aid too) by your brothers Calen|der, Holt, Duane, and Sam. Mor&s;e. I cannot &s;ay how your attempt at the pathos, in the 18th, page, &s;ucceeded; but I pre&s;ume one little vegeta|ble,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Onion.</NOTE> would have produced more tears with fair le&s;s <HI>noi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>tragi-commic</HI> &s;cene of the "Kings being &s;hot at" in pages 24 and 25, <HI>&s;ounds</HI> well, and contains a good &s;hare of humour and &s;atire:&mdash;but it really <HI>appeared better</HI> in the London paper from which you <HI>borrowed</HI> it. And here I would ju&s;t hint whether you have been <HI>quite civil</HI> in u&s;ing the language of others &s;o repeatedly, without giving credit?</P>
<P>In the 21&s;t page you commence an attack on the gentlemen of the law, and pur&s;ue it, for a con&s;id|etable time, with great anger. In this excur&s;ion
<PB N="20" REF="037281_0019_100CAA83AB16F9B0">of abu&s;e, there is &s;ome palliation for your conduct. You doubtle&s;s recollect having read law&mdash;having taken the oath and having attempted to obtain a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tane by the practice of it. You al&s;o recollect that you <HI>did not &s;uccceed.</HI>&mdash;That indu&s;try, per&s;eve|rance and talents were quite <HI>convenient</HI> accompani|ments to a lawyer, you di&s;covered; and relinqui&s;h|ed the profe&s;&s;ion without having a &s;ight at the "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 21 at bottom.</NOTE> keys of St. Peter." In this &s;ituation it is no matter of &s;urpri&s;e that you feel a <HI>little chagrin,</HI> and <HI>much envy.</HI> You have &s;een tho&s;e of your age, and tho&s;e much younger, ri&s;e to eminence in the profe&s;|&s;ion and have</P>

<P>You <HI>po&s;itively</HI> a&s;&s;ert page 22d, that "lawyers are found a&s;cending and de&s;cending the ladder of pro|motion like the angels of God in Jacob's vi&s;ion." Now, I pre&s;ume, no one will di&s;pute the fact with you, for your &s;ituntion has been admirably good to a&s;certain the truth, having always <HI>&s;tood exactly at the bottom of the ladder, looking earne&s;tly up, and never be|ing able to mount a &s;ingle round.</HI></P>
<P>You then call lawyers "excellent &s;tuff for tran&s;|portation to foreign courts." Here, Sir, I doubt your capacity of knowing, for you will not be deemed a competent judge of <HI>what lawyers will</HI> &s;uit in foreign countries from an experiment made on the <HI>&s;ample,</HI> which the &s;hip carried, which tran&s;|ported A. Bi&s;hop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></P>
<P>In page 25th you attempt to point out <HI>the agents in this delu&s;ion,</HI> by which the people are duped. On this part of the &s;ubject, Sir, you have &s;hewed a &s;pirit of &s;lander and wickedne&s;s, which is without a parallel
<PB N="21" REF="037281_0020_100CAA85894D1698">in any publication which has fallen under my eye. You have alledged that all our officers&mdash;all our lawyers&mdash;all our merchants and the whole body of the clergy, are combined to deceive, en&s;lave and de&s;troy their fellow-citizens. Your have written thus, "A que&s;tion is often propo&s;ed how is it po&s;|&s;ible that our greate&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>pious</HI> men &s;hould be|tray us?" And you have an&s;wered it thus "I an|&s;wer becau&s;e you have every thing to loo&s;e and they have every thing to gain."&mdash;You have told man|kind that "greatne&s;s, wi&s;dom and riches" are the means of propagating this <HI>delu&s;ion.</HI> You have ex|plicitly accu&s;ed our clergy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 4 line 10th, from top.</NOTE> with thanking God for war&mdash;a <HI>war</HI> produced to gratify the pride, avarice, and ambition of the&s;e great men. You have &s;aid that "great political <HI>arrangements</HI> are like &s;o many <HI>armaments</HI> again&s;t religion" and yet you charge the clergy with aiding in the&s;e arrangements. And, not to pain the refined and delicate ear with more particulars of your blackguardi&s;m, you have u&s;ed every artifice to convince your hearers and readers that they &s;hould withdraw all confidence from the clergy&mdash;from men of wealth, wi&s;dom and greatne&s;s, and treat them as corrupt, depraved, and vicious ty|rants. In page 21&s;t, in a note (not <HI>written</HI> by you) there is a faint attempt to re&s;cue tho&s;e <HI>few</HI> clergy|men who are democrats, or who expre&s;s no anxiety to re&s;i&s;t Jacobini&s;m, from that odium, with which you attempt to cover, a large and re&s;pectable ma|jority of them.</P>
<P>The language of your oration is analogus to that which the infamous Robert&s;pierre adopted, in the national convention years ago, viz. that it was the duty of the poor to arm again&s;t the rich and de|&s;troy them&mdash;nay you go farther&mdash;you attempt to arm vice, contempt and infamy again&s;t virtue, great|ne&s;s, and worth.&mdash;To be born of re&s;pectable parents&mdash;to be learned in the law, or in theology&mdash;to po&s;|&s;e&s;s

Well earn|ed fame &s;hould be &s;ignalized only with &s;uperior a|bu&s;e and contempt, and a wreath of honor &s;hould be converted into a halter.</P>
<P>In page 29th, pur&s;uing the &s;ame train of ideas, you rank among the &s;elfi&s;h and deba&s;ed, all direc|tors of banks, judges of courts, generals of ar|mies and captains of &s;hips.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. Bi&s;hop, why this <HI>rout</HI> about <HI>ba&s;e-born</HI> and <HI>noblemen?</HI> Is there any &s;uch di&s;tinction known in Connecticut? Look through the &s;tate and &s;ay if men are promoted to offices, or acquire peculiar re|&s;pect, on account of their parentage? The only idea, which offers any &s;upport to this opinion, is, that you once alledged, as a rea&s;on why you &s;hould obtain the office of clerk of the county court at New-Haven, that you was <HI>town born.</HI></P>
<P>Again.&mdash;Is a man de&s;pi&s;ed for his poverty? You know that virtue and worth are re&s;pected wherever found.&mdash;You al&s;o know that in Connecticut there is as fair a chance for talents to meet all that reward which Connecticut can be&s;tow, as in any place on earth.&mdash;You al&s;o know that among the&s;e merchants and civilians whom you have ba&s;ely attempted to revile, are many men of great candor, probity, in|tegrity, and virtue&mdash;that their intercour&s;e with &s;o|ciety is kind and benevolent, and that they are ju&s;t|ly e&s;teemed valuable members of community. It is al&s;o well known that our clergy as a body, are d&s;creet, amiable, pious men, faithfully and &s;teadily pur&s;uing the great duties of their profe&s;&s;ion, and diffu&s;ing peace and happine&s;s among the people. While preparing your envenomed &s;hafts for their vitals, you &s;hould have a&s;ked the&s;e que&s;tions&mdash;Did
<PB N="23" REF="037281_0022_100CAA8A505F5478">not the clergy of Connecticut unite cordially in pro|ducing the American revolution? Have they not uniformly attempted to promote good order in &s;o|ciety? Have not their prayers, &s;ermons, and exam|ple, had &s;ome influence in re&s;training the licentious and unprincipled? Do not many individuals rejoice in their fervor and piety? And is it kind, in me, to repre&s;ent them as entirely unworthy of confidence? Shall I promote the felicity of my fellow citizens by attempting to de&s;troy their affection for the cler|gy? If I &s;hould convert our churches into temples of rea&s;on, and guillotine the mini&s;ters of religion, &s;hould I render any e&s;&s;ential good to mankind, or commend my&s;elf to the favor of God? If the &s;ab|bath were aboli&s;hed and the people of Connecticut, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;embling, once in &s;even days to wor&s;hip their Creator, &s;hould celebrate the decade, and pro&s;|trate them&s;elves before the godde&s;s of liberty, would they be better hu&s;bands&mdash;better wives&mdash;better pa|rents&mdash;&mdash;better children&mdash;better neighbours&mdash;better citizens or better rulers? Should I render any ben|efit to the old man of eighty, were I to convince him that the belief in "twenty Gods&mdash;no God&mdash;or one living and true God" is perfectly immaterial? Should I do him no injury by un&s;ettling his faith, and driving him from that con&s;idence in chri&s;tianity which has been to him "an anchor to the &s;oul," into that doubt and perplexity which pre&s;ents nothing but the gloomy valley of the &s;hadow of death?</P>
<P>If you had made &s;ome &s;uch enquiries, with the lea&s;t candor, you might have &s;aved your&s;elf from &s;ome portion of that infamy which now a&s;&s;uredly awaits you.</P>
<P>I will now reply to &s;ome of your ob&s;ervations as they occur with as little regard to order, if po&s;&s;i|ble, as you have &s;hewn in making them.</P>
<P>In a note in page 31&s;t. you &s;ay "The Republi|can" (meaning the Democratic) "intere&s;t is firm|ly
<PB N="24" REF="037281_0023_100CAA8C033D0290">atached to the <HI>con&s;titution.</HI>" This, Sir, comes with an ill grace indeed from you.&mdash;You who preached on all occa&s;ions and in all companies, and with all manner of abu&s;e, again&s;t that con&s;titution&mdash;you, who explicitly decry all commerce, an ob|ject of immen&s;e importance in that con&s;titution.&mdash;You, who have <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> every mea&s;ure of the admin|i&s;tration (except when &s;eeking an office) <HI>you</HI> now <HI>faintly</HI> applaud it in a <HI>cowardly note.</HI> Do you appre|hend that you can delude any body by &s;uch a &s;nare? The truth is, you now <HI>hate</HI> and always have <HI>hated</HI> that con&s;titution, and this pretended affection of yours is like the perfidious ki&s;s of Judas.</P>
<P>In page 36, you &s;ay you are "willing to be governed by men greater, wi&s;er, and richer than your&s;elf." This is the fir&s;t &s;entiment, on which I have had occa&s;ion to congratulate you. It is for|tunate that you have come to this conclu&s;ion; for if there &s;hould ever be a time when you were not willing to be governed by men "greater and wi|&s;er" than your&s;elf, you would find your inclina|tions <HI>cruelly thwarted.</HI> Indeed, &s;o highly does your prejudice again&s;t great and wi&s;e men, ri&s;e, that you &s;ay, in the &s;ame page, that "we have al|ready a number of men too great for a Republic:" and, like an hone&s;t and good &s;ubject, you are de|termined never to add to their number, and there|fore are a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly laboring to <HI>belittle</HI> your&s;elf: but I a&s;&s;ure you that your exertions have already been &s;ucce&s;sful, and you have attained your object, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a defeat.</P>
<P>In page 42 you rage vehemently again&s;t the ar|i&s;tocracy of Connecticut, in appointments of office. The pamphlet, to which I have once and again al|luded, has pointed out the ab&s;urdity of <HI>your</HI> whi|ning on this &s;ubject. You hold four offices&mdash;one of tho&s;e your father <HI>gave</HI> you&mdash;two of the others, you received from the Court in which <HI>he pre&s;ides</HI>&mdash;the
<PB N="25" REF="037281_0024_100CAA8E67FE8E50">fourth was procured by the recommendation of <HI>his friends.</HI> And do you really believe that if you had re&s;ted on the &s;uffrages of the freemen of Con|necticut, that you could have obtained either of them? I leave this que&s;tion with you and your ac|quaintance; and thus di&s;mi&s;s your rant about ar|i&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>In a note to page 42, you aim a compliment to Pre&s;ident Adams. It is rather &s;ingular that your applau&s;e &s;hould all come in <HI>notes,</HI> but it is prefectly characteri&s;tic of you and your Oration. It is &s;till more &s;ingular that you &s;hould utter a &s;yllable in fa|vour of Mr. Adams; for it has ever appeared to your acquaintance, that if there were any <HI>degrees</HI> in your malevolence towards great and good men, the Pre&s;ident was the object of your mo&s;t delibe|rate hatred.</P>
<P>In page 46 you have <HI>unluckily</HI> hit upon the &s;imile of the "Box of Gla&s;s" with a "Keep this &s;ide up."&mdash;Do you remember your recantation of your &s;entiments when you &s;olicited the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Rod for fool's back.</NOTE> Do you recollect what you then &s;aid and did, and wrote?

<P>In page 48, you pay a compliment, <HI>in a note a|gain,</HI> to a number of democrats. But this is an expen&s;ive compliment to your party in New-Eng|land. Is there no democrat, north of New-York, worthy to be mentioned with tho&s;e <HI>cho&s;en few,</HI> ex|cept Mr. Samuel Adams? What, no <HI>pious</HI> Prie&s;tly

No Gallatin, directly from Geneva, to teach our citizens how to make an <HI>in&s;urrection</HI> again&s;t the government of their Country? Oh <HI>ill-fated</HI> New-England!&mdash;And now Mr. Bi&s;hop, what do you think "Paul of Tar&s;us" would &s;ay to the&s;e <HI>cho&s;en few,</HI> if lie knew their char|acters as well as you and I do?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I mean not here to include either Maddi&s;on, Dickin&s;on or Adams. The fir&s;t I re&s;pect&mdash;the others I do not know.</NOTE></P>
<P>In pages 49 and 50 you have endeavoured to amu&s;e your audience with &s;everal <HI>federal toa&s;ts.</HI> Perhaps tho&s;e drank at Mr. Jeffer&s;on's dinner, on <HI>Sunday,</HI> at Frederick&s;burgh in Virginia, in May 1798, would have been more congenial to your feelings. On that day and on that occa&s;ion, your "di&s;tingui&s;hed citizen," joined in a &s;et of toa&s;ts calculated to contemn, in the &s;evere&s;t manner, the Pre&s;ident and the government of the United States.</P>
<P>In page 60, you &s;ay "it may be well for you (addre&s;&s;ing your audience) to know that the &s;upport of your government co&s;ts you 42,000 dollars a day,"&mdash;and I &s;ay, it may be well for them and you, to know that here you have made a <HI>&s;light error</HI> of 14,000 dollars; and it may be <HI>very well</HI> for them and you to know that in your appendix, to which you here refer, you have made a <HI>blunder</HI> of five millions of dollars in the e&s;timate of 15,000,000 for expenditures for the year 1800. Now a <HI>refor|mer</HI> &s;hould certainly be more correct&mdash;a <HI>financier</HI> &s;hould under&s;tand the <HI>four firt&s;t rules in Arithmetic.</HI></P>
<P>In page 36, there is quite a novel doctrine advan|ced. Your words are "but never let it be forgot|ten that the argument drawn from the coincidence of <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> politicians in public mea&s;|ures is, of all others the mo&s;t alarming. The&s;e are
<PB N="27" REF="037281_0026_100CAA9329664828">the <HI>only</HI> men whom you have to fear. If &s;ome are apparently <HI>more holy</HI> than their neighbours, then if they meddle with your politics, they are mo&s;t capa|ble of deceiving you: their holine&s;s may recom|mend them to heaven, but is no GUARANTEE FOR THEIR POLITICAL RECTITUDE." Here is a &s;pe|cies of rea&s;oning which I think will unfold your true character, and will di&s;play the de&s;ign and ten|dency of your oration. Here, Sir, is a &s;olemn caution again&s;t appointing "great and wi&s;e and holy" men to manage political concerns: and a plain inference is, that <HI>little</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and <HI>unholy</HI> men are to be &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead. Were not the &s;ubject too &s;erious, I &s;hould &s;ay this is election|eering for <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> with great addre&s;s. Here you avow that "holine&s;s" is no "guarantee for polit|ical rectitude." What &s;ecurity then have we for "political rectitude?" It would have been ex|tremely kind for you to have told your "li&s;tening audience" what characters are &s;uited to govern mankind: Or did you avoid it lea&s;t you &s;hould be charged with &s;peaking of <HI>your&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>But, Mr. Bi&s;hop, to be more &s;erious with you, Do you not mean, by the &s;entiments ju&s;t quoted, to deny that a principle of holine&s;s does exi&s;t? Do you not repre&s;ent that the di&s;tinctions between wi&s;dom and folly, virtue and vice, piety and impi|ety, are idle and u&s;ele&s;s, mere creatures of the im|agination and re&s;t on no &s;olid foundation?&mdash;You mean this preci&s;ely, or you mean that which is &s;till more horrid, viz. That vice, folly and impiety are more excellent qualities than virtue, wi&s;dom and holine&s;s, e&s;pecially in a ruler.&mdash;A&s;k Chri&s;tians what they think of &s;uch &s;entiments? A&s;k all who po&s;&s;e&s;s any remains of morality, if the prevalence of &s;uch opinions would not &s;oon convert this world into a dreary wa&s;te of wretchedne&s;s and woe? A&s;k the&s;e que&s;tions, and then read that &s;olemn declaration of the living God contained in 2d Samuel xxiii. chap.
<PB N="28" REF="037281_0027_100CAA94B12B2498">3d ver&s;e. "The God of I&s;rael &s;aid&mdash;the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me, He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t ruling in the fear of God."</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages which I have ju&s;t quoted are intro|ductory to your unqualified prai&s;e of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, to &s;ub&s;erve who&s;e election to the Pre&s;idency, you have laboured, with a <HI>zeal</HI> which de&s;erved a <HI>better cau&s;e,</HI> and in a <HI>manner</HI> which would <HI>di&s;grace any cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Of this gentleman, you have indeed &s;poken fa|vorably, and to prove him worthy of the confi|dence of the people of Connecticut, you have di&s;|canted on his learning, greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s. But is he not too "great a man for a Republic?" Mu&s;t you not take <HI>his</HI> "altitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 36.</NOTE> with a quad|rant?" You have through a tedious oration of 64 pages, laboured to convince your readers, that wi&s;|dom and grantne&s;s were noxious qualities in a ruler: &mdash;Here your favorite is exalted to the heavens by the profu&s;ion of them!&mdash;Strange contradictions! You have forgotten <HI>"Keep this &s;ide up."</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, I agree with you Mr. Jeffer&s;on is a learned man&mdash;an ingenious man&mdash;a Philo&s;opher.&mdash;I know not but that he is hone&s;t in his intercour&s;e with &s;ociety and amiable in private life; there is however &s;trong rea&s;on to believe that he is an ob|&s;tinate infidel.&mdash;Adam Smith, the celebrated au|thor of the Wealth of Nations, characteri&s;ing Da|vid Hume, ob&s;erved that he approached nearer to divinity than any man he ever knew.&mdash;Yet how bitter an enemy to Chri&s;tianity was David Hume?</P>
<P>You &s;ay Mr. J. &s;upports a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel at his own expen&s;e.&mdash;If this be true, I think it would be honorable to religion and its mini&s;ter if <HI>he would attend</HI> his mini&s;trations and not confine
<PB N="29" REF="037281_0028_100CAA970DC67188">them to his &s;ervants. But, Sir, it is a well e&s;tab|li&s;hed fact that Mr. J. never has attended public wor&s;hip during a re&s;idence of &s;everal years in New-York and Philadelphia. Why not? His friends <HI>pretend</HI> that it was becau&s;e the clergy <HI>abu&s;ed him</HI> for his political &s;entiments.&mdash;This is untrue&mdash;but if true, is it an an&s;wer? Would a lover of the wor|&s;hip of God neglect it for &s;uch a rea&s;on? Would Daniel&mdash;would "Paul of Tar&s;us" have thus con|ducted?</P>
<P>Again. You &s;ay in your la&s;t page and confirm it in your la&s;t note, that he &s;poke "reverently of God." So has Thomas Paine, Godwin, Rou&s;&s;eau, Hume, Bollingbroke and Gibbon with almo&s;t eve|ry other avowed enemy of Chri&s;tianity. The great|e&s;t and mo&s;t malignant &s;coffers at religion, frequant|ly &s;peak, in the mo&s;t exalted terms, of the Supreme Being; but when they define his attributes or &s;peak of his moral government, then, their impiety and mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities, ri&s;e into view.</P>
<P>The&s;e champions in the cau&s;e of infidelity, with|out a &s;ingle exception, and your oration is a &s;ignal proof of the propo&s;ition, level their artillery a|gain&s;t the <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>profe&s;&s;ors</HI> of religion, and thus aim the "dagger of death" at its vitals. If any per&s;on will read Paine's Age of Rea&s;on and compare his abu&s;e of mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tians with your jeers and ridicule at the &s;ame objects, he will perceive as near a coincidence, as &s;ituation and cli|mate will permit.</P>
<P>Let me now examine the pa&s;&s;age from Jeffer&s;on's notes quoted in your appendix, to vindicate him from the charge of infidelity, fir&s;t remarking that the introduction to that quotation is <HI>borrowed.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;entiment &s;o often commented upon, is in the&s;e words, "But it does me no injury for my
<PB N="30" REF="037281_0029_100CAA992F91FA80">neighbour to <HI>&s;ay</HI> there are twenty Gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg." Here Mr. J. is attempting to &s;how the impropriety of legi&s;lative interference in matters of religion. If he had &s;aid that faith was not a &s;ubject of legi&s;lation I would &s;ub&s;cribe to the opinion; but he unque&s;tiona|bly means that it is not injurious to individuals or &s;ociety for a man to <HI>declare</HI> that there are twenty Gods, or that there is no God, and con&s;equently that there &s;hould be no law again&s;t bla&s;phemy and therefore <HI>clearly,</HI> none again&s;t profanity of any kind, becau&s;e tho&s;e vices do neither "pick pockets nor break legs." But wi&s;e legi&s;lators have thought different on this &s;ubject. In this &s;tate there is a &s;tat|ute again&s;t bla&s;phemy, &s;anctioned with &s;evere pen|alties&mdash;there is al&s;o a law again&s;t profane &s;wearing. This is the ca&s;e in the country whence we emigra|ted and I believe in all the &s;tates of New-England, perhaps in many others.&mdash;Nay, all well regulated communities puni&s;h men for &s;landering individuals, and for reviling the government of their country. This is not complained of here or in Virginia. On what principle do the&s;e laws re&s;t? Doubtle&s;s on this; that the peace of &s;ociety &s;hall not be di&s;turbed nor the confidence of people in their rulers, be de|&s;troyed by fal&s;ehood and calumny.&mdash;But alas! the religion of the bible&mdash;the Saviour of &s;inners&mdash;the God of the univer&s;e, may be profaned, derided or bla&s;phemed, with impunity!</P>
<P>And is it indeed no injury to me, as an individ|ual, or as a member of &s;ociety, that our &s;treets &s;hould re&s;ound with oaths and cur&s;ings?&mdash;That children &s;hould hear, in every lane and alley, the name and attributes of God contemned? Will not the prevalence of &s;uch practices, efface the fear and reverence of God from the young and tender mind, and produce that contempt for every thing &s;acred, which leaves the heart a prey to every corrupt pro|pen&s;ity? Parents and Chri&s;tians will think of the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="037281_0030_100CAA9B4BFEE088">things and regret that Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;hould have been the author of &s;uch &s;entiments; and that our temples &s;hould be theatres to recommend them.</P>
<P>In another part of this quotation Mr. J. &s;peak|ing of New-York and Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ays, " reli|gion is well &s;upported, of <HI>various kinds</HI> indeed; but ALL GOOD ENOUGH; all &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve peace and order." Two things are inferable from this pa&s;&s;age; fir&s;t that the only benefit re&s;ulting from religion, is the pre&s;ervation of the peace and order of &s;ociety, and &s;econdly that, for this purpo&s;e, all the various religions in tho&s;e &s;tates were <HI>equally good.</HI> A &s;trange &s;entiment for a Chri&s;tian! for a Chri&s;tian did I &s;ay? No Chri&s;tian, unle&s;s deluded, could utter it. We are here taught that religion is confined in its benefits to this world&mdash;that it is &s;imply de&s;igned to make men peaceable and orderly, and that <HI>any</HI> kind of religion is good enough for the attainment of this end. And now, Sir, let me a&s;k whether if the "Bi&s;hop of Ephe&s;us" had been in the pul|pit of that hou&s;e, which you profaned, he would have addrre&s;&s;ed his "li&s;tening audience" thus? "Men and brethren.&mdash;It is of no con&s;equence whether men &s;ay there are twenty Gods or no God&mdash;all the various kinds of religion, Jewi&s;h and Ro|man catholic, and all others are good enough for the purpo&s;es of &s;ociety, and <HI>beyond that</HI> they are of no importance.&mdash;Greatne&s;s, wi&s;dom and holine&s;s are injurious qualities in a ruler.&mdash;Mini&s;ters of re|ligion and profe&s;&s;ors, &s;hould be &s;hunned and avoided as the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety. Holine&s;s of heart is no guarantee for political rectitude: and wi&s;dom and virtue are combined to de&s;troy you; and finally, let me exhort you to u&s;e <HI>all</HI> means to elect Mr. Jef|fer&s;on Pre&s;ident of the United States."</P>
<P>Or if "Paul of Tar&s;us" had been one of <HI>your</HI> "li&s;tening audience," do you think he would have thought it proper, <HI>as a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> to
<PB N="32" REF="037281_0031_100CAA9D63E47A00">have applauded your oration with &s;miles and ge&s;tures of peculiar approbation? It is much more probable to me that he would have ro&s;e and, with that Chri&s;|tian intrepidity, for which he was celebrated, have addre&s;&s;ed you, as he formerly did Elymas the &s;or|cerer, who &s;ought to turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, and as Bi&s;hop Wat&s;on did Thomas Paine, "O full of all &s;ubtilty and all mi&s;chief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteou&s;ne&s;s, wilt thou not cea&s;e to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL now examine your conduct in attempt|ing to influence the election which took place on the Monday after the oration was &s;poken, and con|tra&s;t it with &s;ome &s;entiments which you have there uttered.</P>
<P>In the town of Hamden your efforts were con|&s;picuous. You went there &s;everal times in the dead of night&mdash;di&s;tributed nominations for a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and directed the men to be voted for in the delegation to Congre&s;s; and to aid and promote the changes which you de&s;ired to effect, you propagated the mo&s;t palpable fal&s;ehoods: and, to fini&s;h your infa|my, on your return to New-Haven, you boa&s;ted that you had <HI>revolutionized</HI> Hamden.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame views and, by the &s;ame ba&s;e and foul means, you intrigued in Ea&s;t-Haven, We&s;t-Haven, and North-Haven.</P>
<P>On the Friday night before freemen's meeting, you went to Wallingford&mdash;di&s;&s;eminated your ora|tions&mdash;repeated, to a collection of people &s;ome of
<PB N="33" REF="037281_0032_100CAAA041340B60">the mo&s;t inflamatory pa&s;&s;ages, and wrote and di&s;|per&s;ed a great number of nominations, leaving no artifice untried to effect your vile purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>By your own confe&s;&s;ions your labors in New-Haven are known. You have confe&s;&s;ed, Sir, that New-Haven was divided by the Democrats into di&s;|tricts&mdash;that men were appointed to operate in the&s;e di&s;tricts, and to <HI>enlighten</HI> the freemen and in|fluence their votes&mdash;that li&s;ts were made out, con|taining the names of the Federali&s;ts, the doubtful, and the Democrats, and that e&s;tabli&s;hed Demo|crats were appointed to convince and confirm the wavering. You have pointed out the boundaries of the di&s;trict over which you pre&s;ided&mdash;ack|nowledged that you ro&s;e early, on the morning of the election, went towards Dragon bridge, found <HI>nine</HI> of your men on the &s;pot, di&s;patched <HI>tho&s;e nine</HI> to others, and finally that you collected all <HI>your men</HI> except one, and had them all in town, by nine in the morning, you your&s;elf "bringing up the rear." And to exhibit the extent of your iniquity, you confe&s;&s;ed to re&s;pectable people, the night after the election, "that the object of the Democrats was to get into office." I omit here to mention the vigil|ance with which, for weeks, you &s;ought every op|portunity to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, by all the &s;lander of which you were ma&s;ter, again&s;t men who&s;e talents and virtue will forever look you into contempt. I omit to mention that this nomi|nation was, by you, given to many who knew nothing of the characters&mdash;who did not know Ro&s;well Jud&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> from George Penro&s;e or Hen|ry H.

<P>But the&s;e feelings are &s;peedily converted into tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character, when I reflect how little you <HI>can</HI> effect&mdash;how little you <HI>have</HI> effected&mdash;how uniformly your &s;chemes, through life, <HI>have proved abortive.</HI> Then I am ready to &s;mile at your folly and in&s;ignificance&mdash;to view you, on the&s;e e|lectioneering excur&s;ions, and on the &s;tage, as the harmle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Dr. Willoughby,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A noted quack in medicine who has travelled thro' Litch|f Hartford and New-Haven counties, peddling out for all di&s;|ea&s;es, his <HI>golden gout ointment.</HI></NOTE> when re|turning from <HI>peddling out</HI> his <HI>golden gout ointment</HI> as a &s;pecific for all di&s;ea&s;es.
