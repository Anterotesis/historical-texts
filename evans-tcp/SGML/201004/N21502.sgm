<HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THESE E&s;&s;ays are to be con&s;idered as only an introductory &s;pecimen of a much larger work, con|&s;i&s;ting of Letters to a young Lady, on the much neglected &s;ubject of Fe|male Education.&mdash;The&s;e letters were intended to be compri&s;ed in three &s;mall pocket volumes; the fir&s;t recommend|ing religious duties and writers for the culture of the heart; the &s;econd proper &s;tudies and authors for the im|provement of the under&s;tanding; and the la&s;t pointing out the nece&s;&s;ary, do|me&s;tic duties, as well as the proper manners, graces and accompli&s;hments of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>The whole work was intended to have made its appearance at the &s;ame time; but the intervention of other

Nor perhaps, may they now ever &s;ee the light, though nearly prepared for it, unle&s;s particularly called for (which he &s;carcely expects) by the encourage|ment given to the&s;e preparatory &s;ketch|es. He has little to &s;ay concerning the performance now before the pub|lic; but only that he conceives the &s;ubject to be important, whatever may be its execution. He is &s;en&s;ible how invidious a ta&s;k it is to attack e&s;tab|li&s;hed &s;y&s;tems, prejudices, habits, er|rors, that have been ridiculou&s;ly <HI>con|&s;ecrated,</HI> as it were, by the lap&s;e of time, and what di&s;graceful epithets are lavi&s;hed on the man, who &s;ets up, from whatever motives, either for a cen&s;or or a reformer of his age. He
<PB N="v" REF="028263_0004_0FD7DB5CCAA9F330">is con&s;cious that neither his talents nor his &s;tation will ju&s;tify him in a&s;|&s;uming &s;o arduous a character, and has therefore cautiou&s;ly concealed a name, which might only rai&s;e a prej|udice again&s;t his bold undertaking, and hidden him&s;elf behind the &s;hade of &s;ecrecy, until critici&s;m &s;hall have ful|ly emptied its quiver, and <Q>the in|dignation of publick cen&s;ure is overpa&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the Publication of the fir&s;t Edi|tion of the&s;e <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e,</HI> the author has thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gible to prefix his name to the work.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Still as he conceives that the cau&s;e of truth and virtue &s;hould fear <HI>no di&s;couragements,</HI> and that neither mediocrity of talents nor ob&s;curity of &s;tation &s;hould di&s;courage a man from <HI>great</HI> undertakings, the time may come, when he &s;hall openly avow the&s;e pro|ductions of his pen, contented with the pittance, which an impartial publick &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give him, of cen&s;ure or of fame.</P>

<P>Many &s;y&s;tems of in&s;truction have been adopted for the other &s;ex, va|rious as the countries, the religion, the climate, or even as the caprices of the writers, who, at different pe|riods, have undertaken to compo&s;e them. But, by a &s;trange fatality, women have been con&s;iderably o|mitted in the account, as if they were not gifted with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, but were only to be valued for the beauty of their per&s;ons, for the elegance of their manners, or the &s;ymmetry of their forms.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, we make no conce&s;&s;ions, or abatement in our expectations from them, for this contemptuous neglect. Forming a high and flattering e&s;timate of what their character <HI>&s;hould</HI> be, we extend no allowance for this

<P>With this &s;entiment of women, we are cautious to give them a cor|re&s;ponding education.

Per&s;on and manner are the great object in the education of this &s;ex. To render the one beau|tiful, and the other enchanting, are our highe&s;t care. This in gen|eral, is the employment of the gov|erne&s;s. To this are devoted all the labours of the toilet. To this are con&s;ecrated their mornings, and their days. The con&s;equence is,

<P>HOW far a publick or a private education is mo&s;t to be preferred, is an enquiry, that has

Without entering at all into the <HI>detail</HI> of the argument, or attempt|ing to appreciate the &s;eparate mer|its of the different rea&s;oners, a &s;en&s;ible mind forms this conclu|&s;ion, that a private education is more favourable to <HI>morals,</HI> that young people at lea&s;t, &s;hould nev|er be tru&s;ted to the dangerous in|fection of publick &s;chools, till principles and even <HI>habits</HI> of vir|tue have had time to <HI>take ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> but that neither a private, nor publick, but an education uniting, in &s;ome degree, the advantages of <HI>both,</HI> is mo&s;t eligible for tho&s;e, who wi&s;h their children to be, at once, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents and of virtues.</P>

<P>Circum&s;tanced as we are, pub|lick &s;chools are the only po&s;&s;ible, <HI>general</HI> receptable for the educa|tion of youth; and, as we pay the teachers, in order that a per&s;on may not &s;tarve by his profe&s;&s;ion, the&s;e &s;eminaries mu&s;t contain &s;uch numbers of young people, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to tend with

<P>Hence men of any liberal &s;en|timents, or any decent fortune will not &s;ubmit to the <HI>humiliating</HI> ta&s;k. Hence (excepting in a few publick &s;chools, endowed by the munificence of our more virtuous ance&s;tors, and requiring a gradu|ate from the univer&s;ities) ma&s;ters, in general, are but poorly quali|fied for the office they a&s;&s;ume; and hence an employment, in it&s;elf the mo&s;t elevated and honourable of all others, in its tendency the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important to the &s;tate, in the eye of religion and of en|lightened rea&s;on, requiring the &s;tronge&s;t union of goodne&s;s and of talents, and, in the &s;ounder policy of the ancients, devolving only on the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and

<P>Let it not be &s;aid, that their <HI>manners</HI> have de&s;erved it. Let it not be urged that their ignorance of life and cu&s;toms, their rudene&s;s, their pedantry, their carrying in|to &s;ociety the imperiou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;chool, and expecting indi&s;crim|inately from the people they con|ver&s;e with, the homage paid by pupils to their de&s;potick throne, have been the real cau&s;e of &s;uch an odious &s;tigma thrown upon their order. Though the con|ducting of a &s;chool is not favour|able to the temper or manners, yet a per&s;on of <HI>real</HI> education and

<P>With regard to women, I do not know that this famous que&s;|tion about a publick or private education has ever been agitated. Indeed it is not nece&s;&s;ary. Though &s;uch parents, as think of being generous and liberal, &s;eldom fail to give them the fir&s;t, yet the lat|ter, in the e&s;timate of &s;ober rea&s;on, is certainly to be preferred; and, whatever elegant or high &s;ounding &s;chools may be &s;ought out for a girl, yet a mother &s;eems the only governe&s;s, intended by nature.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="028263_0174_0FD7F9F94DD1A4B8">
Three principal advantages of publick &s;chools for boys are; 1&s;t. That they cure a timid ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;h a confidence, &s;o nec|e&s;&s;ary for any publick character or employment; 2dly. That they ex|cite a proper emulation by the colli&s;ion of talents; and 3dly. That they fo&s;ter early, la&s;ting friend|&s;hips, &s;ometimes of a powerful kind, which frequently lead the way to worldly honour and ad|vancement.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e effects will not, by a <HI>judicious</HI> friend, be recom|mended to women. Confidence, in them, "is a horrid bore;" and let a &s;illy fa&s;hion &s;ugge&s;t what it will, their &s;weete&s;t graces are the crim&s;oning <HI>blu&s;h</HI> and the retiring <HI>timidity.</HI></P>
<P>As to emulation, there are often children enough in their own fam|ily,
<PB N="176" REF="028263_0175_0FD7F9FC8190F488">or in the circle of their near|e&s;t acquaintance to communicate the &s;pirit, &s;o far as it is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> or u&s;eful among&s;t tho&s;e, who are not to hold the reins of govern|ment, the offices of &s;tate, or the po&s;t of a commander, and who cannot a&s;pire to &s;acred greatne&s;s in the honours of the purple.</P>
<P>The la&s;t effect is &s;uper&s;eded, likewi&s;e, by the nature of their &s;ex; as the grand promotion, of which <HI>they</HI> are capable, is a dig|nified marriage, which their <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> acquaintance are not capable of conferring; which a publick life is not likely to en&s;ure, and which they will always have the greate&s;t chance of forming to advantage, of they rather court the &s;hade of a meritorious <HI>retirement,</HI> than the intoxicating notice of the <HI>publick eye.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="028263_0176_0FD7FA02773A13A8">
So far, therefore, from their receiving any &s;olid <HI>advantages</HI> from this method of expo&s;ure, I conceive that it often &s;ubjects girls to numerous inconveniencies, dan|gers and temptations, which their early age, and yet unripened vir|tue are not always found &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Thrown together in &s;hoals, in|to one common re&s;ervoir, at a <HI>dan|gerous</HI> age, when nature bids an unu&s;ual fervour ri&s;e in their blood, when they feel them&s;elves &s;prung into a new epoch of exi&s;tence, ac|tuated with &s;imilar feelings and &s;imilar de&s;ires, and when a re&s;tle&s;s lei&s;ure awakens all the powers of imagination and the &s;en&s;es, they in&s;en&s;ibly convey an infection to each other by tales of <HI>&s;entiment, &s;ympathy</HI> and <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> and by various communications, &s;chemes

<P>Almo&s;t every thing <HI>in</HI> and <HI>about</HI> the&s;e &s;eminaries, has a tendency to corrupt the heart. What is it the&s;e fair pupils are taught to pant for? Admiration.

<P>It would di&s;play a great igno|rance of human nature to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a combination of great talents is frequently to be met with in <HI>any</HI> female; and it would argue a &s;till higher degree of ab|&s;urdity and inexperience to expect them <HI>concentred</HI> in the character of &s;uch a one, as generally un|dertakes

<P>So little is the e&s;teem, in which the character of <HI>Governe&s;s,</HI> like that of <HI>Schoolma&s;ter,</HI> is held, and &s;o inadequate are the rewards, conferred on the&s;e people, that the office, in the <HI>be&s;t</HI> point of view, will, very frequently, devolve upon tho&s;e, who, having once &s;een bet|ter days, but now fallen from their dignity, have contracted not a little of that de&s;pondency and <HI>&s;ourne&s;s,</HI> which attend degradation; and, in the wor&s;t, will, as often be undertaken, as a la&s;t <HI>re&s;ource,</HI> by many, who are not famous for the <HI>liberality</HI> of their &s;entiments, as they have not been di&s;tingui&s;hed by that of their <HI>education.</HI> To expect that <HI>&s;uch</HI> women &s;hould be patterns, either of the <HI>graces</HI> or the <HI>virtues,</HI> would be hoping a|gain&s;t

<P>Nor do I conceive that Board|ing Schools have &s;uch a tendency, as has generally been imagined, to give the &s;o <HI>much valued</HI> excel|lence of politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Without ea&s;e, there can be no grace. Without grace, there can|not be politene&s;s.

<P>It will appear from the general complexion of the&s;e remarks, that they are de&s;igned, principally, to apply to people in the higher ranks of life. Among&s;t others, ca&s;es, doubtle&s;s, will occur, in which a publick &s;chool may have

<P>In a flouri&s;hing, commercial country, like Great Britain, &s;ome parents will attain, from <HI>very low beginnings</HI> to &s;o ample a fortune, as to wi&s;h their children a much better education, than they them|&s;elves have enjoyed, or are capable of imparting. And it will occur to every reflecting per&s;on, from the nature of the ca&s;e, that, under <HI>their</HI> roofs, daughters might imbibe only a &s;et of illiberal no|tions, or a &s;y&s;tem of vulgar, pur&s;e|proud &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s. To <HI>&s;uch,</HI> the&s;e &s;eminaries, defective as they are, may have their u&s;es and ad|vantage.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of <HI>&s;uch</HI> girls, as well as their manners, may <HI>here</HI> receive an elevation and refine|ment. They may feel them&s;elves
<PB N="192" REF="028263_0191_0FD7FA2DE33DAEC8">levelled, nay u&s;efully humbled by the company of their &s;uperiors.
