<HEAD>THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author has, in this treati&s;e endea|voured to repre&s;ent CAIN under the weight of tho&s;e awful impre&s;&s;ions that violent murder generally makes upon the mind of the perpetrator, and the remor&s;e of con&s;ci|ence that accompanies guilt of &s;o horrid a nature; at the &s;ame time, to inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of humiliation and penitence, with a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of an offended GOD. Though the infliction of his cha&s;ti&s;ements may be attended with &s;evere cro&s;&s;es and tribulations for re&s;tle&s;s and uncomfortable &s;ea&s;ons; yet &s;till his di&s;pen&s;ations are all appointed for our good in the end. Although the calami|ties of our body or mind, inflicted upon us for our iniquities, may &s;eem for the pre|&s;ent grievous, we mu&s;t not mi&s;tru&s;t his clemency and mercy, for his ways of re|velation far exceeds our finite comprehen|&s;ions. The&s;e con&s;iderations are encou|ragements to the vile&s;t &s;inner, not to de&s;|pair, nor for the mo&s;t upright man to pre|&s;ume;
<PB REF="030283_0008_0FE5A1520826F5B8">for although, while we are in the body there is <HI>hope,</HI> &s;o on the other hand, to counterbalance that hope, there are <HI>temptations.</HI> The <HI>Almighty</HI> can, and fre|quently does make u&s;e of &s;upernatural means to convince us of his <HI>Omnipotency,</HI> and wean our affections from tran&s;itory and peri&s;hable delights; and though tho&s;e alarming <HI>mementos,</HI> may convey terrific ideas to our imaginations, yet &s;till his pur|po&s;es are founded upon unerring wi&s;dom; and calculated for our good; and while we re&s;train all our <HI>inordinate</HI> de&s;ires, he will bountifully &s;upply all our <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> wants, as far as con&s;i&s;tent with his own <HI>glory,</HI> and our good.</P>

<P>Thus was CAIN to&s;&s;ed to and fro by the agitations of his mind; framing &s;uch im|perfect ideas of the nature of death&mdash;whe|ther he had or had not killed ABEL his brother, as we mu&s;t naturally conclude that ABEL was the fir&s;t corp&s;e that CAIN ever &s;aw, having no Scripture tradition to give us room to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary.</P>
<P>CAIN in this &s;tate of perplexity delibe|rates within him&s;elf to go to his father and make known his anxiety&mdash;thus &s;aid,

<P>With eyes intently fixed upon the ground had CAIN hitherto remained, and now looks towards the &s;ky to &s;ee his father&mdash;he looks, he &s;urveys the expanded atmo&s;phere, he trembles! and with quivering limbs, un|able to &s;u&s;tain nature, down he fell with a groan to the earth&mdash;<HI>Adam is gone!</HI> his <HI>comforter!</HI> the <HI>con&s;olating friend</HI> of the &s;u&s;|pending penitent has received the &s;ummons of <HI>Omnipotency</HI> to return to the THRONE of MAJESTY.</P>
<P>The eyes of CAIN began now to over|flow and water the ground with grief&mdash; the whole frame of nature was in a &s;tate of perturbation, and in the agonies of his &s;oul would cry out&mdash;</P>
