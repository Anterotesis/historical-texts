I &s;ay <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be levelled, becau&s;e mo&s;t of his Readers will under&s;tand that to be the Sequel of his Objections; and that they would not be worth the Pains he takes, if this Conclu|&s;ion was not to be inferred: Although he has not indeed put his Arguments in Mood and Figure.</P>
<P>To be <HI>Fellow-Labourers,</HI> he calls an <HI>Important Part of the Mini&s;terial Character.</HI> Page 10. I &s;hall not crack my Brains to comprehend the Profundity of this A&s;&s;ertion. But this be|ing the Theme of his Di&s;cour&s;e; he would have his Hearers con&s;ider and comprehend, that all Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are <HI>Fellow-Labourers.</HI> Thus he explains his Sen&s;e of being <HI>Fellow-Labourers;</HI> &s;ome would think he <HI>&s;eems</HI> to conclude, that Men can't be Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, if they don't an&s;wer his De&s;cription in that <Q><HI>Important Part of the mini&s;terial Character:</HI></Q> And then, he tells, us, Page 20. <Q><HI>There are &s;everal Things oppo&s;ite hereto,</HI> and which, where|ever they obtain, prevent Mini&s;ters acting in the Charac|ter under which they are mentioned in his Text,</Q> i. e. <HI>Fellow-Labourers.</HI>&mdash; Then he adds, <Q>A <HI>fixed PRELACY</HI> in the Church is another Thing repugnant to, de&s;tructive of that Equality which renders Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters <HI>Fellow-Labourers.</HI> This you all know (quoth he) obtains in the Church of <HI>England;</HI></Q> The Con&s;equence mu&s;t at lea&s;t, <HI>&s;eem to be,</HI> that the Communion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is un&s;afe, Men can't &s;afely or lawfully in the Sight of GOD join with them, becau&s;e &s;o <HI>important</HI> a Part of the mini&s;terial Character is wanting among them. He lays &s;o much Stre&s;s upon this <HI>Important</HI> Matter, that I can't think any indifferent Per&s;on will &s;ay I have put a forced Con&s;truction upon his Di&s;cour&s;e, when I make the Conclu&s;ion to be a <HI>&s;eeming</HI> to &s;ay, that our Mini&s;try is &s;o defective in an <HI>Important</HI> Part of the Character, that no &s;erious Per&s;on &s;hould venture to join him|&s;elf to &s;uch a Communion.

<P N="1">1. By con&s;idering the Force of all his Objections again&s;t the Validity and Regularity of our Mini&s;try, on Account of the Hierarchy of our Church; i. e. The Prelacy e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>

I am only at pre&s;ent concerned to examine his Arguments for levelling all Orders in the Church; and I &s;hall be very willing to join in condemning all Practices that may be called counter-working the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.

<P>It don't <HI>&s;eem</HI> to me, that he intended it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the Mini&s;ters of his Per&s;wa&s;ion in <HI>Connecticut</HI> to be Fellow-Labourers, and therefore not oppo&s;e the Twenty-Six Bi&s;hops in <HI>England;</HI> much le&s;s our-half Mini&s;ters (as he would have them e&s;teemed; the Pre&s;byters.

<P>And thus when Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> thinks St. <HI>Paul</HI> was ordained to the Apo&s;tolate, with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> Acts 13. and went upon the Works of converting the Gentiles; <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> Apo&s;tles, had this &s;ame <HI>Mark,</HI> who was al&s;o called <HI>John,</HI> for their Mini&s;ter, in the Original <HI>Diaconos.</HI> Acts 13.5.

<P>But perhaps &s;ome of his Readers may think his Argument for Equality among Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, taken from the Com|mi&s;&s;ion our Saviour gave to his Apo&s;tles, being but one and the &s;ame, de&s;igned for all Mini&s;ters, may exclude all Impa|rity in Office and Power; although the &s;ame may not be inferred from their being <HI>Fellow-Labourers.</HI></P>
<P>This is an Argument that has been u&s;ed before him; and may amu&s;e inattentive Readers, but is nothing more than Amu&s;ement; far from being a &s;ufficient Foundation to con|clude that our Communion mu&s;t be dangerous, or un&s;afe from any Effects of re&s;training the Power of Ordination and chiefe&s;t Juri&s;diction to the Bi&s;hops, although but 26 among many Thou&s;ands of the inferior Clergy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI>'s De&s;ign is to a&s;per&s;e our Con&s;titution in Re|gard of the Pre&s;byter's Office, and per&s;wade his ignorant and inattentive Readers, that &s;uch of the Clergy of the Church

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. With Re&s;pect to the Apo&s;tles who were immedi|ately authorized to gather and govern the Church by this Commi&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems to make them Equals in that Power: Certainly it does not &s;ubject &s;ome unto any one of their Number: In &s;hort there is no Pope e&s;tabli&s;hed by this Com|mi&s;&s;ion: And yet I care not &s;ay, that a Primate among the Apo&s;tles was repugnant to any Thing contained in this Commi&s;&s;ion, provided he had been regularly cho&s;en by the College of Apo&s;tles, who &s;eem to have a very ample Power given them, and much le&s;t to their Wi&s;dom and Prudence; e&s;pecially under the Guidance of <HI>In&s;piration.</HI> And if for the more effectually promoting the great De&s;ign of their being authorized with this ample Power, they had thought fit, or &s;hould have been afterwards directed by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to appoint a Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident out of their Number, and then &s;hould have decreed, that in ordaining Colleagues in the Apo&s;tolate one of the&s;e &s;hould pre&s;ide, and no &s;uch Ordination performed without the Pre&s;ident or Vice Pre&s;i|dent: And if they had been directed by the Holy Gho&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h Pre&s;idents and Vice Pre&s;idents &s;o many as &s;hould be &s;ufficient for Admi&s;&s;ion of Colleagues into the Apo&s;tolate in all Ages and Places, I can't conceive any Clau&s;e of the Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. would have been contra|vened thereby, I &s;ee no Clau&s;e &s;orbidding &s;uch an Imparity, when it &s;hould be regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>And as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> allows, that this Commi&s;&s;ion, enabled them to provide a Succe&s;&s;ion in their Office, Page 18. &mdash; I think we many fairly &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, it &s;ufficiently authorized them to concert &s;uch Mea&s;ures, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Rules, as might &s;eem convenient in an Affair of &s;o much Importance to the Church, as the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Apo&s;tolate, or Epi&s;|copate which is the &s;ame, &s;hould be; that faithful Men in every Age, might &s;ucceed in that &s;acred Office, and the

<P>That the <HI>Deacons</HI> were an Order inferior not ony to the Apo&s;tles, but to other Mini&s;ters then in the Church, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> allows. Page 16. That they were appointed by the Apo&s;tles, an <HI>Order</HI> in&s;tituted for <HI>&s;ome</HI> Services in the Church, cho&s;en and ordained, Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> allows; and al|though only &s;even are mentioned as ordained at the fir&s;t In|&s;titution of that Order, yet more were added afterwards; and <HI>their Order,</HI> di&s;tinct from and inferior to the Pre&s;byters,

<P>At the fir&s;t Appointment of this Order, the Apo&s;tles direct|ed the Brethren to look out &s;even Men <HI>full of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And St. <HI>Stephen</HI> who was one of them, is &s;aid to be full of Faith <HI>and Power,</HI> and that be <HI>aid great Wonders and Miracles among the People.</HI> Acts 6.8.

And baptized his Converts, ver. 12&punc; 13: But confirmation and giving the Holy Gho&s;t by Impo&s;ition of Hands, was re&s;erved to the highest Order. The Apo&s;tles &s;ent <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> for this. Ver. 14, 15. &amp;c. Here is a clear Account of one of the lowe&s;t Order&punc; (but not &s;o low as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> would make him) performing the &s;acred offices of Religion, and in the &s;ame Chapter we are told of his preaching and baptizing, ver. 29, &amp;c. Ver. 40. We find Deacons as well as Bi&s;hops mentioned in the Apo&s;tle's Salutation, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> in&s;tructs <HI>Timothy</HI> about the Qualifications for <HI>Deacons</HI> as well as <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.8; <HI>Ignatius,</HI> one of the ear|lie&s;t Chri&s;tian Writers, mentions Deacons as an Order of the Clergy, and <HI>Tertullian</HI> in the &s;econd Century, mentions the Deacons Power of baptizing with the Pre&s;byters, as being both alike derived from the Bi&s;hop, and in Subor|dination to him. So that we are to look upon Deacons as Mini&s;ters in the Church, deriving their In&s;titution from the Apo&s;tles, having their Power to preach and baptize in the Name of Chri&s;t, by Virtue of the Commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave to his Apo&s;tles, but never were though: <HI>equal Officers</HI> to the Apo&s;tles.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="006081_0016_10278208534E0058">by inferring Equality from the Word <HI>Fellow-La|bourers</HI> in his Text, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to &s;ay that <HI>Marcus</HI> and <HI>Demas</HI> &amp;c. were equal to St. <HI>Paul</HI> and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles; and when he argues Equality among all Mi|ni&s;ters, from their deriving Power from the Commi&s;&s;ion immediately given to the Apo&s;tles; he mu&s;t mean that all Mini&s;ters, mu&s;t be equal with the Apo&s;tles, and that therefore the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves could not be Prelates, i. e. as having any Authority or Juri&s;diction over other Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, yet I can't believe that Mr. <HI>Ho|bart</HI> him&s;elf, or any other Per&s;on of tolerable Sen&s;e will deny (upon cool Reflection) the <HI>Imparity</HI> in Office and Power, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Apo&s;tles and other Mi|ni&s;ters; I mean <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> as well as <HI>Deacons,</HI> &s;o long as the Apo&s;tle them&s;elves lived and pre&s;ided in the Church.</P>
<P>I don't know of any that pretend to more Orthodoxy than Quakers, that have denied an Order of Elders or Pre&s;byters &s;uperior to Deacons, and inferior to the Apo&s;tles, of whom Mention is &s;o often made in the New-Te&s;ta|ment, as well as by the very fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Writers and in all later Accounts of Chri&s;tianity. So that I need &s;ay no more upon it, and will mention only two Texts in the Writings of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to put the Matter out of all Doubt, that in the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tianity, GOD him|&s;elf e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Imparity</HI> among the Mini&s;ters whom he &s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel of his Son; and did not think it was nece&s;&s;ary all his Mini&s;ters &s;hould have one <HI>Office,</HI> and <HI>one Work;</HI> becau&s;e one Commi&s;&s;ion to the Apo&s;tles, was e&s;|teemed &s;ufficient to convey Power from GOD to every Order and every Individual in each Order to the End of Time; as thereby a Succe&s;&s;ion might be provided, of &s;uch as were well authorized to give Power to as many in each Rank, or Degree of Order and Office, as the Churches Needs &s;hould require.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells the <HI>Corinthians, GOD hath &s;et in his Church</HI> fir&s;t Apo&s;tles, &s;econdly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that <HI>Helps, Governments,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.28. Then to declare their <HI>Inequality</HI> as much as Words can expre&s;s, by an In|terrogation
<PB N="19" REF="006081_0017_10278209D5DFA3D0">implying Negation, he adds, ver. 29. <HI>Are all Apo&s;tles? Are all Prophets?</HI> &amp;c. Meaning no, by no Means. The other Text I &s;hall refer to is Eph. 4.11. &s;peaking of the Gifts be&s;towed by our Lord upon his Church at his A&s;cen&s;ion, <HI>And he gave, &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Prophets, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> &amp;c. I will leave this without a Comment, &s;uppo&s;ing the Im|parity made by GOD him&s;elf at that Time to be very clear and evident; and as &s;uch <HI>Imparity</HI> has always in Fact been found in the Church, in every Age, we mu&s;t have better Arguments than &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> has brought, to make any Man of Sen&s;e believe the Commu|nion of a Church un&s;afe meerly becau&s;e &s;uch an <HI>Imparity</HI> is found among her Mini&s;ters: Nay it &s;hould on the other Hand be rather thought dangerous to be of a Com|munion, without Prelacy, e&s;pecially when all the mini|&s;terial Power they have, is claimed from a Commi&s;&s;ion never given by Chri&s;t to the Claimants them&s;elves; nor to any of &s;o inferior a Rank as they value them&s;elves upon, whether of the Laity or &s;uch Renegado Pre&s;byters as threw off their Subjection to their Bi&s;hops, and invaded the &s;acred Office contrary to their Ordination-Vow and Promi&s;e, and Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays Oath too.</P>
<P>Now, as in all Governments, the Head mu&s;t be the Fountain of Power; what could derive from &s;uch who&s;e highe&s;t Station was a State of profe&s;&s;ed Subjection? And neither GOD nor Man had ever given them the Power of authorizing others, any farther than as Rea&s;on per|mits every Man to make a Repre&s;entative or Attorney for him&s;elf; but none for another Man, much le&s;s for GOD; without a &s;pecial Authority. So that there is Rea&s;on to be doubtful, whether after all their Solemnities, they have any more than Deputies from Men, who pretend to act with them in Things pertaining to GOD: And this Doubt mu&s;t be increa&s;ed from what Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ays, Page 17, &s;peaking of the Commi&s;&s;ion given to the Apo&s;tles, and in them con&s;tituting an Order of Prelates, to be continued by regular Succe&s;&s;ion, viz.

<P>I only therefore propo&s;e to con&s;ider under this Head, whether &s;o much as Inexpediency may be argued again&s;t conforming to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on Account of what Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mo&s;t</HI> Certainty of an Inundation of Vice and Immorality; and De&s;truction of practical Religion that will attend the introducing of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Which Sugge&s;tion is a wicked Calumny proceeding from that Bigotry and Self-Admiration which the Zealots, among every Sort of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Sectaries,</HI> are remarkably tinged with.

<P>Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> propo&s;es a Compari&s;on to be made between <HI>New-England,</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands</HI> where no Teachers have been but Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould find &s;ome &s;uch Places more addicted to Cur&s;ing and Swearing and Intemperance, than <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and le&s;s careful to ob&s;erve the Sabbath; which Vices I would by no Means extenuate or excu&s;e, perhaps &s;ome Vir|tues may be found there al&s;o, not &s;o con&s;picuous in <HI>New-England;</HI> and when the Vices and Virtues of both Parties are to be exactly weighed, who &s;hall hold the Ballance?

The People of <HI>England</HI> were a very religious and pious People before any Independents or Pre&s;byterians opened Meeting-Hou&s;es in <HI>England,</HI> this is well known to all that are acquainted with our Hi&s;tory and the Genius of the Na|tion in tho&s;e Days. And there are remaining to this Day <HI>Monuments</HI> of the Virtue, Piety and practical Godline&s;s of our Forefathers, in the Endowments of Churches, Ho&s;pitals, Colleges and Charity Schools, and many other In&s;tances that our de&s;pi&s;ing Neighbours can't pretend to vie with; and notwith&s;tanding the large Strides that Vice, Irreligion, Athe|i&s;m and Profanene&s;s have made in their Advances, &s;ince the Phanatick Phrenzy opened the Sluce of Impiety and Wicked|ne&s;s, and demoli&s;hed all the Hedges about Religion and Vir|tue, when they overturned the Con&s;titution of the Nation, pulled down Monarchy in the State, and Prelacy in the Church. Yet vital Piety and Religion fruitful in &s;olid Virtue and &s;ub|&s;tantial Goodne&s;s is yet to be found in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in a Degree not to be parallel'd by any of her boa&s;ting Ene|mies. The printed Sermons and Di&s;cour&s;es of our Divines are &s;ufficient Monuments of their laudable Endeavours to put a Stop to the Flood of Athei&s;m and Immorality that has been flowing in upon us, the Progre&s;s of which, although it ought to be lamented, is not owing to the Tendency of any Doc|trine, taught by our Church; or any Faults in the Con&s;titu|tion of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> But to the Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ions introduced by a Variety of Sectaries, all weaken|ing the Churches Di&s;cipline, and with much Zeal propagating Notions and Opinions naturally de&s;tructive of Vertue, and reproachful to Chri&s;tianity; thus by <HI>&s;eeming</HI> very zealous for Godline&s;s, in a Way of Strife, Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, and declaiming again&s;t Morality, and Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and other Methods which I care not to mention, we have &s;een Chri|&s;tianity expo&s;ed to the Contempt of Infidels, and carele&s;s Living and Vice encouraged by Methods pretending to ad|vance the Glory of &s;overeign Grace.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Hobart</HI> had well under&s;tood, the true Cau&s;es and Springs from which the Immorality, Athei&s;m and Profane|ne&s;s of the pre&s;ent Age is derived, he could never have im|puted it to any Defects in the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> in his Di&s;cour&s;e there is <HI>Fallacia non Cau&s;ae pro

And as the late &s;candalous Efforts of fanatick Zeal &s;o di&s;reputable to Chri&s;tian Religion, and well known to have direct Tendency to Profanene&s;s and impure Living, were an Improvement upon the Doctrines common|ly received in this Country, and might have made a much greater Progre&s;s, if the Ob&s;tructions and Checks it met with from the Church of <HI>England</HI> Congregations had been out of the Way, (altho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to the Honour of many not of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Communion, that they &s;hewed a be|coming Di&s;countenance to tho&s;e Di&s;orders, and did their ut|mo&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s them.)

But when any Nation becomes Chri&s;tian, i. e. by any authentick, national Act e&s;tabli&s;heth Chri&s;tianity for the Reli|gion of &s;uch Nation, and receives &s;uch a Model of the Church of Chri&s;t as was &s;ettled by the Apo&s;tles, that makes a <HI>nation|al Church;</HI> the Largene&s;s of which may require many of the &s;uperior Order of Officers or Succe&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles, to an&s;wer the Ends of Government and Ordination, and there|fore although tho&s;e by Office are equal, the Pre&s;ervation of Order in the Church will require Rules for Precedency; hence we find early in the Church <HI>Metropolitans, Primates, Arch-Bi&s;hops,</HI> as well as among the inferior Orders, Arch-Pre&s;by|ters, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Prebends and Canons. And &s;uch is the Nation of <HI>England,</HI> fir&s;t a Civil Society Indepen|dent; having a Right to govern it &s;elf, and make Laws to regulate its own mo&s;t important Affairs, without being lia|ble to the Controul of any Power upon Earth; then adopt|ing Chri&s;tianity into their Con&s;titution, and by authentick Laws making it the Religion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, provid|ing for the Support and Dignity of Bi&s;hops, and the Main|tenance of the inferior Clergy, and for the decent Perfor|mance of the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip; and thus become a Chri|&s;tian Church, the <HI>Church of England:</HI> Which is the &s;ame as the Nation of <HI>England</HI> become Chri&s;tian, and a true Part or Member of the one Catholick Church.</P>

<P>Without a Clergy regularly authorized to mini&s;ter in the Church of GOD, he will not pretend an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution agreeable to the Go&s;pel.

<P>It ought to be con&s;idered that this Opinion is contrary to the Sen&s;e of all Chri&s;tians that own an <HI>Inequality</HI> of Order, and therefore all the famous and noted Churches from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;tles Days; and if true, denies any Superiority in the <HI>Apo&s;tles them&s;elves</HI> over the <HI>Elders</HI> they ordained in every City; which I am per&s;uaded few Men of Sen&s;e, upon cool Reflection, will give into.</P>

<P>This needs but little An&s;wer; for &s;uch an Argument would have the &s;ame Force in Behalf of the mo&s;t corrupt Religion, and again&s;t the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Duty, if Men mu&s;t think them&s;elves obliged to abide by the Choice of their Parents in their Behalf, when they come to be able to di&s;|cover their Errors.
