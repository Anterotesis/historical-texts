<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UNION ought to be a grand object in all our proceedings. The permi&s;&s;ion to EXPORT RICE TO GREAT-BRITAIN, which &s;urprizes, but not plea|&s;es, the generous planters of this colony, had ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> proved fatal to that <HI>Union</HI> in the Grand Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters"> Our accepting this indulgence will break <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> here&mdash;A noble <HI>refu&s;al</HI> of the dangerous permi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">, is the only way to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Let this colony open its eyes. Let not their par|tiality for the worthy gentlemen who mi&s;took them, lead a generous people to mi&s;take them&s;elves. We can heal the wound, if we are not ob&s;tinate in doing wrong.</P>
<P>I will take the liberty of throwing a few hints to|gether, which may ca&s;t light upon the &s;ubject, for their benefit who have not attentively viewed its parts; and hope to be happy in &s;eeing the bone of contention removed, by the &s;pirit of the colony.</P>
<P>Let it then be premi&s;ed,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It is a matter univer&s;ally agreed upon, that a non-exportation to Great-Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, is a nece&s;&s;ary, an ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry, part of the American plan of defence: that a meer non-importation, is too lame and ineffectual a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> But to render &s;uch an agreement of real efficacy, it mu&s;t extend to the &s;taple commodity with which every colony trades to tho&s;e places. Nothing can be more ridiculous, than to talk of a non-expor|tation, in which the grand &s;taple of each colony is to
<PB N="4" REF="013888_0003_0F9256B80559B488">be exported. Export rice and indico from South-Ca|rolina, and I believe the world will not call it a non-exportation agreement, though you &s;hould lay an em|bargo upon potatoes and oy&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> Almo&s;t equally ridiculous, would be the propo&s;al of &s;hutting up trade with all mankind, be|cau&s;e good policy demands to &s;hut it up with Britain. I always &s;u&s;pect the man who propo&s;es too much, as having a de&s;ign to prevent any mea&s;ures whatever. We may get a &s;upply of nece&s;&s;ary articles from other parts of the world, the want of which might po&s;&s;ibly force us to break our re&s;olves. The call for arms and ammunition in ca&s;e of extremity, ought to keep up a trade with the Dutch. A ve&s;&s;el, once at &s;ea, may go to Britain, it is true. There will be breaches of faith, but the amount of &s;uch pieces of infidelity, will not be &s;o great, as to prevent the good effects of the agreement.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> In any &s;uch agreement that can be form|ed, <HI>we cannot expect, that all the colonies &s;hould be upon an equal footing.</HI> You mu&s;t give them all the &s;ame &s;taples, the &s;ame trade; you mu&s;t exactly a&s;&s;imilate their different climates, &s;oils and produce, before you can put them exactly upon a level, as to the article of &s;elf-denial and &s;uffering. That man is in a political delirium, who, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, will make an exact equality <HI>the grand object;</HI> and to in&s;i&s;t upon <HI>it,</HI> is to in&s;i&s;t upon an impo&s;&s;ibility. One part mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer more than another, and that in proportion, to the quantity of its &s;taple, which is concerned in trade to the prohibited ports. This is an unavoidable evil. But if non-exportation is never to be attempted, un|til a plan of exact equality is hit upon, we &s;hall never
<PB N="5" REF="013888_0004_0F9256B8C642B110">have one; and if the cau&s;e of the&s;e colonies mu&s;t de|pend upon &s;uch an expedient, all is lo&s;t. The very propo&s;al of &s;uch an equality, as a &s;u&s;pending term, I take to be, either highly frivolous, or highly in&s;idious.</P>
<P>It appears <HI>frivolous</HI>&mdash;as the grand &s;truggle is not, whether one colony &s;hall have equal advantage with another, but whether all &s;hall be <HI>free.</HI> If indeed there was a pro&s;pect, that the Northern colonies would gain by our lo&s;s: if they were like to take away our trade in future time, the &s;uppo&s;ed inequality might ju&s;tly make us jealous. But, as this cannot be pre|tended, &s;o to examine critically, whether there will be an <HI>exact equality</HI> in our lo&s;&s;es, before we con&s;ent to mea&s;ures confe&s;&s;edly nece&s;&s;ary for our mutual &s;al|vation, is to trifle egregiou&s;ly. It appears &s;trange to me, that ever &s;uch a thought &s;hould be &s;tarted by an hone&s;t man. The que&s;tion to me &s;eems not, whether we &s;hall go equal lo&s;s and gain, to an ounce or a &s;cruple? we are not merchants or apothecaries &s;ettling accounts: but <HI>whether the mea&s;ure is nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;e|cure our freedom?</HI> if nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>whether the grand ob|ject we are contending for, is worthy our &s;uffering?</HI> whether we &s;hould be willing to &s;ubmit to the pre|&s;ent lo&s;s, rather than bear the cur&s;e of &s;lavery? I think there is not one true Carolinian, untouched by the baneful poi&s;on of corruption, who can he&s;itate a moment. Nay, the man who repre&s;ents us as <HI>unwil|ling</HI> to adopt any &s;uch &s;elf-denying mea&s;ure, does the colony great inju&s;tice. The voice of the people, when they &s;ent their members, was, for any, nay, the mo&s;t &s;elf-denying, mea&s;ures: they could &s;carcely be re&s;trained from them at the time; and they did not commit their power to five men, in order to &s;ave them
<PB N="6" REF="013888_0005_0F9256B98DED1FE0">from &s;uffering in common with their brethren; but to agree, if nece&s;&s;ary, to the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures. For this purpo&s;e, unlimited powers <HI>were demanded.</HI> For this purpo&s;e, unlimited powers were granted. They &s;urely had no thought of &s;u&s;pending the union of the continent, of &s;u&s;pending the liberties of Ame|rica, upon an exact equality of lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But though it is frivolous, yet it is a popular argu|ment&mdash;it puts on the &s;aint-like appearance of con|cern for the country.</P>
<P>I am aware of the dangerous power of jealou&s;y. I know the effect which an artful harangue, upon this topic, is apt to have, upon tho&s;e who do not &s;ee its tendency. If you can per&s;uade the people here, that the Northern colonies are only &s;cheming to pre&s;erve their trade, while you are duped to let yours &s;uffer&mdash; you will do more by this &s;tratagem, than by a thou|&s;and arguments. Make them believe this, and it is a wonder, if they are not ready even to give up their li|berties to a tyrant, rather than be thus outwitted. I do not pretend to vindicate the conduct of all the Nor|thern delegates; &s;ome of them are &s;u&s;pected of being &s;nakes in the gra&s;s. But I am bold to &s;ay, that there is not the lea&s;t evidence of &s;uch a de&s;ign in the colo|nies in general. I defy the man who throws out the ungenerous in&s;inuation. I view it rather as an in&s;i|dious attempt to carry a cau&s;e, by exciting popular jealou&s;y. It is agreed, that to &s;top our exports to Britain is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Arbiter of all has &s;o ordered it, that our exports to Britain are greater than tho&s;e of any other colony; but does it follow, that, therefore, the Northern colonies mean to dupe us? The argument is popular, but it is di&s;hone&s;t.
<PB N="7" REF="013888_0006_0F9256BA417BE5E8">All that ju&s;tly follows, is, a po&s;&s;ibility of our &s;uffering more than &s;ome others in the glorious &s;truggle. And where was ever a &s;truggle for Liberty, in which the &s;ufferings of every individual were exactly balanced? I believe you are convinced, that Bo&s;ton &s;uffers, in|nocently &s;uffers already, more than you all.</P>
<P>The grand argument therefore, for our per&s;i&s;ting in the exportation of Rice, concludes <HI>nothing,</HI> even if the premi&s;es were true. But,</P>
<P>I hope to make it appear to you, that they are not true&mdash;that we are upon a better footing than <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the other colonies, even if the exportation of Rice to Britain, &amp;c. was prohibited: I hope to make it ap|pear, that the mea&s;ure extorted from the Congre&s;s, is <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary, impolitic, impracticable,</HI> and <HI>ruinous.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The premi&s;es I think are not true. It is alled|ged, that we are not upon &s;o good a footing as they, if Rice to Britain, &amp;c. is prohibited. I think, on the contrary, we have equal, if not greater advantage, Let it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P>We may find vent for two thirds, if not for all our crop of rice, even if the trade to Britain and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands is not open. It is known, that the ports to the &s;outhward of <HI>Cape Fini&s;ter</HI> are open by act of parliament, which will not expire until this &s;truggle will probably be over. There is a legal way to carry rice to them, without touching in England. Li&s;bon, all the ports in the Mediterranean, the Azores and Canaries, are open, and take off now 30,000 tierces per annum. If the Portugueze, &amp;c. knew, that the vent of rice through Britain was ob&s;tructed, they would gladly be your factors for 30,000 more, to
<PB N="8" REF="013888_0007_0F9256BE11D08C00">the great injury of the Engli&s;h trade; as thereby the &s;hipping of other nations would get the employ of theirs, and &s;ome hundreds of Engli&s;h and Scotch &s;hips, and many thou&s;and hands, whom this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;u&s;tains, would be out of bread.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we can &s;hip our rice (though not directly hence) from the Northern colonies, in the &s;ame man|ner that the merchants of New-York and Philadel|phia now do, without touching in England; and by that means &s;upply, in the Baltic, all the Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, and Ru&s;&s;ian ports, as well as the great marts of Holland, Hamburgh, &amp;c. &amp;c. This would take off not le&s;s than 40,000 tierces more. And even a novice in trade mu&s;t &s;ee, that if the Dutch, and o|thers, had the lea&s;t hint given, that they would be welcome as our carriers, the whole crop, though it was ever &s;o large, would be gladly engaged. The Engli&s;h laws have hitherto rendered it not worthy their notice&mdash;the&s;e re&s;olutions will alter the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>For the above articles, I appeal to the men in trade&mdash;and from <HI>them</HI> to the whole province, whe|ther the re&s;i&s;tance made to the non-exportation of rice to Great-Britain, &amp;c. was not needle&s;s, to &s;ay no more&mdash;and, whether we are not upon a much better footing, as to our &s;taple, than any one Nor|thern colony, even if tho&s;e four pe&s;tilential words had never cur&s;ed the fourth article of the a&s;&s;ociation?</P>
<P>As to the exports of the Northern colonies to Eu|rope, by the tenor of the a&s;&s;ociation, every one knows that the principal articles will be, <HI>Fi&s;h, Wheat,</HI> and <HI>Flour:</HI> the others are &s;carcely worth mentioning.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;h will ea&s;ily find a mart. But be it re|membered, that this is neither exported in Engli&s;h
<PB N="9" REF="013888_0008_0F9256BF31B8DDD8">bottoms; the Engli&s;h merchants are not the factors of it, as they are of our rice landed in Britain; nor are the people of that country employed in it. Fi&s;h, for the mo&s;t part, goes immediately to the Catholic do|minions, for the good people there to fa&s;t upon. Be it al&s;o remembered, that only three colonies have any thing to do with the fi&s;h trade; and not one fiftieth, I had almo&s;t &s;aid not one hundredth man, in tho&s;e colonies, has any concern in it.</P>
<P>Unground Wheat goes mo&s;tly to Li&s;bon and the Madera's; but (if <HI>Canada</HI> is &s;truck off the li&s;t) not one thirtieth bu&s;hel is exported in the whole grain.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Flour,</HI> it mo&s;tly finds its vent in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. It &s;upplies that va&s;t part of the Eng|li&s;h, French, Dani&s;h, and Dutch dominions with bread. But all this immen&s;e market is &s;hut up, and flour, <HI>a much more peri&s;hable article than clean rice;</HI> an article which always &s;poils in one &s;ea&s;on, is left to &s;our on their hands. The part of their crop which Li&s;bon, the Canaries, Azores, and a few Mediterra|nean ports take off, is but a &s;mall relief. It is well known, that the merchants have not found it profit|able, to embrace the permi&s;&s;ion to carry it to Great-Britain. So &s;tands this grand &s;taple of the Northern colonies ob&s;tructed, that they have not an equal chance to get it off, as we have to vend our rice.</P>
<P>But if you con&s;ider their other &s;taple commodities, you will find, that they mu&s;t &s;uffer inexpre&s;&s;ibly, if we may call it &s;uffering, when we are only prevented getting rich. Their <HI>Iron,</HI> which has, of late, almo&s;t &s;upplied all Britain and Ireland&mdash;their <HI>Copper</HI>&mdash;their <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which amounts to an immen&s;e &s;um&mdash;their <HI>Timber,</HI> which builds near all the hou&s;es in the i&s;lands, and freights multitudes of &s;hips to England&mdash;their
<PB N="10" REF="013888_0009_0F9256BF7A9A3280"><HI>Staves</HI> and other Lumber, on which the We&s;t-India i&s;lands depend&mdash;their <HI>Pot-A&s;h,</HI> equal, perhaps more, in value, than our whole crop of indico&mdash;their <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Pork</HI>&mdash;their <HI>Flax Seed,</HI> upon which all Ireland depends&mdash;their <HI>Peltry, Hemp,</HI> and many <HI>other</HI> arti|cles&mdash;all which, collectively taken, infinitely exceed their <HI>Flour</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>&mdash;all the&s;e, I &s;ay, they have con|&s;ented to lay utterly a&s;ide.</P>
<P>It will appear, I think, to an unprejudiced mind, that, far from <HI>"&s;kulking,"</HI> as they are illiberally &s;aid to do in this conte&s;t, they will be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. If there is any <HI>&s;kulking,</HI> it is on the &s;ide of tho&s;e, who demand a permi&s;&s;ion to export their chief &s;taple to England. All that is wanted, or de&s;ired, is, to break off our exports to Britain. They have done that fully. We continue our chief export to Britain. We di&s;&s;ent from the united agreement of all America: and that, when we &s;hould have fared perhaps better than the re&s;t, if we had come into the a&s;&s;ociation in the ful|le&s;t terms. In proportion to our numbers, we &s;hould perhaps have received more ca&s;h in remittance, than any one Northern colony. But we, as it were, break the &s;word of America&mdash;we cruelly di&s;&s;ent&mdash;we export to Britain, and give our enemies cau&s;e to de&s;pi&s;e us. I cannot but hope, that the argument of non-equali|ty will hereafter hide its &s;erpent head, and no more delude this unhappy colony, into a betraying of the cau&s;e of freedom.</P>
<P>As for the pretence, that rice is a peri&s;hable arti|cle, it has no weight. Little of it need remain on hand. It will keep an hundred years, in the rough; &s;ome years, when clean: and if mo&s;t of the rice plan|ters would &s;pend one whole &s;ea&s;on in making im|provements, it would be of more &s;ervice to them than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013888_0010_0F9256C047A54E50">
But I argue farther,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the demand of a free exportation of rice, was UNNECESSARY.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the people here did not render it nece&s;|&s;ary, nor did their exigences require it. It is plain, that the rice planters did not de&s;ire&mdash;did not expect&mdash;were greatly &s;urprized at it, when it came; nay, in general, have &s;ince, that wi&s;hed the odious di&s;tinction had never exi&s;ted. This colony boa&s;ts a &s;pirit equal to any on the continent. They have the honour of being proverbial for patrioti&s;m. They plainly te&s;tified, that they de|&s;ired no favours, at their general meeting. Had not this been the ca&s;e, they never would have put it in the power of any men to bind them. They continue of the &s;ame mind &s;till.</P>
<P>Our exigences do not require it. This appears in a &s;triking light, from what has been &s;aid already: But let me a&s;k, what exigency can we plead? One of three, no doubt: either that of remittance to mer|chants at home&mdash;or to procure us bread&mdash;or for negro cloathing. I make no reply to the fir&s;t. It is &s;tale. It has been an&s;wered a thou&s;and times. Their righ|teous &s;ufferings, as a criminal part of that nation which is forging chains for us, will ever be an&s;wer enough.</P>
<P>As to the nece&s;&s;ity of exports to buy us food, none can pretend to this. We wallow in plenty of provi|&s;ions, even while we export them. We &s;hall not have the le&s;s, when this exportation is re&s;trained.</P>
<P>As to negro cloth, I am &s;orry to hear it mentioned. Is there not cloth enough in the colony, with the old garments which they already have, to cloath the negroes comfortably for the next winter? Is not this a colo|ny that demands le&s;s cloathing than any other, at the
<PB N="12" REF="013888_0011_0F9256C0FB97F370">&s;ame time that we may ea&s;ily grow &s;ufficient cotton in one &s;ea&s;on, to cloath us for five? Has not providence meerly innundated us with <HI>Weavers</HI> from Ireland, as though with a view to this very cri&s;is, who only wait the word to come down from the back parts in &s;warms? There are more weavers now in the colony, than the cloathing of twice our number would require; and two &s;ea&s;ons &s;urely afford time enough for it. Nor can it be di&s;puted, after the example of Virginia, &s;o far to the North, that cotton is by much the be&s;t and cheap|e&s;t cloathing that can be made for them.</P>
<P>Not only unnece&s;&s;ary:&mdash;the exportation of rice to Britain and her i&s;les, at the pre&s;ent time, is truly IM|POLITIC.</P>
<P>Rice is the mo&s;t important export from America to Great-Britain. The value of our crop landed there is perhaps more than a million and an half currency. Now, they have the profit, of being factors for this great &s;um&mdash;they have the advantage of employing be|tween two and three hundred ve&s;&s;els in the trade to America, and to different parts of Europe, in tran&s;|porting this bulky article&mdash;they have the benefit of giving bu&s;ine&s;s to thou&s;ands of hands, who, without this, would perhaps want their bread:&mdash;be&s;ides, the continual imports of rice into Britain, keeps down the price of provi&s;ions there, in proportion as it is con&s;umed&mdash;and much more is actually con&s;umed, than the advocates for the u&s;ual exportation are wil|ling to allow, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Great quan|tities are con&s;umed in the &s;ingle article of <HI>Starch.</HI> Rice &s;upplies the navy with a part of its provi&s;ion, as well as merchant men on their voyages. This finds the Engli&s;h merchant the be&s;t article of foreign trade. This is al&s;o part of the provi&s;ion for the &s;lave trade, which
<PB N="13" REF="013888_0012_0F9256C1CCC57C48">&s;till goes on to the i&s;lands. In &s;hort, I am much in|clined to believe, that the &s;ingle article of rice pre|vented from landing in Britain and the i&s;lands, will more affect their trade, than all other articles of North-American exports together, only excepting <HI>Tobacco</HI> and <HI>Indico.</HI></P>
<P>And while we have &s;o good a pro&s;pect of a vent for our crop el&s;ewhere, &s;hall we, in this very cri&s;is of our affairs, act &s;o very impolitic a part, as to give the nation all the&s;e advantages again&s;t us, when we have in our hands &s;o great a weight to throw into the &s;cale of American freedom? I would blu&s;h for my coun|trymen, if I thought them &s;o far dive&s;ted of the com|mon principles of prudence.</P>
<P>Not only unnece&s;&s;ary and impolitic&mdash;the plan pro|po&s;ed is IMPRACTICABLE; and I fear the con&s;e|quences will be ruinous.</P>
<P><HI>Impracticable,</HI> I do not fear to a&s;&s;ert the plan pro|po&s;ed, as a &s;ugar-pill to the indico planters, viz. to exchange rice for indico. Perhaps the difficulty will be at lea&s;t as great, to gain the con&s;ent of individuals to this, as to a qualified non-exportation. But how is it to be executed? Where are the numerous commit|tees to be found, who, unpaid, &s;hall take the endle&s;s ta&s;k of in&s;pecting every barrel of rice, and every pound of indico, that comes down to market, and to a&s;cer|tain its &s;pecific value? Where is the court, daily to pre&s;ide over the con&s;tant <HI>Barter,</HI> and to decide the nu|merous di&s;putes which mu&s;t ari&s;e between man and man? Where are the open offices in which all this va&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to be tran&s;acted? Where are the free &s;tores, in which the produce mu&s;t lay after the deci|&s;ion? Or, mu&s;t the indico men from <HI>Ninety-Six</HI> have the trouble fir&s;t, to &s;end down their crop&mdash;then to
<PB N="14" REF="013888_0013_0F9256C282D94F20">have it in&s;pected&mdash;then apprai&s;ed; &mdash; then &s;ell their proportion of rice;&mdash;then carry home that part of their indico which they are obliged to keep, or el&s;e leave it here under the care of others? And who can en&s;ure the rice planters, that the &s;ame indico &s;hall not be brought a &s;econd and a third time, and re-claim rice, until it is all expended? A &s;cheme of &s;uch intricacy, needs whole years to adju&s;t it. It needs a complete new &s;et of officers to execute it. Endle&s;s di&s;putes&mdash;unavoida|ble divi&s;ion, mu&s;t be fore&s;een, by tho&s;e who know any thing of mankind. How much more &s;imple&mdash; how much more eligible, the plan of equality, as to all exports to Britain and her i&s;lands?</P>
<P>Not only impractible, is the propo&s;ed plan of ex|porting rice&mdash;but I fear it is RUINOUS,</P>
<P>Not to the pockets of the merchants here&mdash;not to the merchants in England&mdash; but RUINOUS</P>
<P>To the peace, harmony and mutual confidence of the colonies; who are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that their mo&s;t faithful friends of Carolina &s;eem, in this, to have de|&s;erted them. A confidence which, I know, the rice planters would &s;pill their blood to &s;ecure and cultivate, and which they never de&s;ired &s;hould &s;uffer injury on their accounts. RUINOUS</P>
<P>To the peace and harmony of this province it&s;elf. I dread the gathering cloud. I dread the effects of jealou&s;y, lowering from the We&s;t and North. By one act of noble genero&s;ity, you may di&s;pel it, in &s;pite of the devil him&s;elf. RUINOUS, I fear,</P>
<P>To the whole &s;y&s;tem of our commercial &s;truggle. <HI>Ruinous</HI> to all our plans of defence. <HI>Ruinous</HI> to pant|ing hunted Liberty her&s;elf. How mu&s;t it di&s;courage our &s;uffering brethren, when they find their mo&s;t &s;pi|rited &s;upporters &s;hrinking, like cowards, from the
<PB N="15" REF="013888_0014_0F9256C351216FE0">&s;hadow of a little &s;elf-denial! How mu&s;t it make the mini&s;try chuckle, to find the &s;eeds of &s;o luxuriant a jealou&s;y &s;own among us, and their only hope confirm|ed! How mu&s;t it envigorate their declining &s;pirits, to find our a&s;&s;ociation &s;o burle&s;qu'd, &s;o crippled, where they expected it to prove the mo&s;t robu&s;t and active! How mu&s;t it bla&s;t the expected fruit of popular cla|mour in England, to find that, by our par&s;imony, they are delivered from feeling much of the effects of a boa&s;ted non-exportation. Give them rice, and you do much to &s;ilence and make them ea&s;y under the bungling tyranny of the pre&s;ent court. God forbid, that you &s;hould accept of the extorted gratuity, upon &s;uch ignoble, &s;uch ruinous terms!</P>
<P>But, what a &s;troke!&mdash;what a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of po|licy, as well as patrioti&s;m! to REFUSE to export rice, and exhibit an in&s;tance of firmne&s;s and love to our country, which mu&s;t damp the ardour of the mini&s;terial a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, confirm the tottering confidence of all America, prove the death of our inte&s;tine jea|lou&s;y, and, in the end, ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of this glorious, this divine &s;truggle, for the rights of men and of Britons.</P>
<P>I would therefore humbly propo&s;e, that, without &s;eeming to over&s;et the compelled agreement of the Congre&s;s, we &s;hould only declare it to be the &s;en&s;e of this colony, that the permi&s;&s;ion TO EXPORT RICE TO EUROPE, SHALL BE UNDERSTOOD, AS EXCLUD|ING GREAT-BRITAIN, AND HER DEPENDANT ISLANDS.</P>
