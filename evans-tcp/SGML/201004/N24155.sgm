<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from a very intere&s;ting tour, and will employ the few moments I remain in this place in giving you a &s;hort, and probably a very imperfect &s;ketch of it. In my la&s;t I mentioned having a letter from the <HI>Marquis de la Fayette to

his wife.</HI>&mdash;I had without con&s;ideration undertaken to forward it to Mr. Morris, our mini&s;ter at Paris; but on reflection I was &s;truck with the impropriety of enclo&s;ing him a letter from a man who&s;e name alone was trea&s;on in France, and at a period when all letters were opened, and when the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t innocent corre&s;pondence with emigrants, continually brought numbers to the guillotine.&mdash; I endeavoured both at Lau&s;anne and at Geneva, to find &s;ome per&s;on going into France, who would promi&s;e to deliver it, but I ea&s;ily preceived there was no one who would expo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;uch a ri&s;k&mdash;In this &s;ituation, the intere&s;t I felt for the character who wrote the letter, and a de&s;ire of &s;eeing France at a period &s;o critical, induced me, though &s;till indi&s;po&s;ed, to re&s;olve on being the bearer of it my&s;elf. I applied to Citoyen Soulavia the French Re&s;ident at Geneva for a pa&s;&s;port. He told me the one I had from Mr. Pinckney was bet|ter than any he could give me, but that in a time of revolutions the mere&s;t trifle might irritate the peo|ple, and with my Engli&s;h accent and appearance, he thought it advi&s;able to give up entirely the idea of going to Paris. Not &s;atisfied with his advice, I determined to apply to higher authority, and to wait on a <HI>repre&s;entant du peuple,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A member of the Convention.</NOTE> who had lately arrived in the department bordering on Swit|zerland. The curious accounts I had heard of of this man made me de&s;irous of &s;eeing him; and I was fortunate enough to meet him a few days afterwards at <HI>Ver&s;oy.</HI> A <HI>repre&s;entant du peuple</HI> is a &s;ort of <HI>viceroy</HI> cho&s;en in the bo&s;om of the con|vention

<PB N="57" REF="031947_0007_0FEF5CED87C43478">
gave me &s;o much con&s;equence in the eyes of the people, that before I got out of Verloy I was ki&s;&s;ed by the Mayor and all the municipality.&mdash; The day after, I &s;et out on my journey to Paris, and notwith&s;tanding the ridiculous &s;cene I had been witne&s;s to, I flattered my&s;elf that I &s;hould return with many arguments to &s;upport my favourite o|pinion, "that after all their follies, and the horrors they had committed, the French would end by rendering them&s;elves not only feared but re|&s;pected."</P>
<P>I left Nyon on the 10th of Jan. but my chai&s;e breaking down on the top of the Yurd, I was expo&s;ed for near two days to the mo&s;t inclement weather at a &s;mall village called "<HI>les Roupes,</HI> the fir&s;t French port, in <HI>Franche compt.</HI>" I found a great degree of tranquility: they were happy in having the Swi&s;s for their neighbours, and in the protection of their mountains.&mdash;At Dijon, Aux|ere, Sens, &amp;c. the <HI>E&s;prit revolutionaire</HI> was in full force.&mdash;Cro&s;&s;es were broken, chapels burnt, ma|ny churches entirely de&s;troyed, and tho&s;e that re|mained had &s;ome part or other torn down; the celebrated convent of the <HI>Chartreux,</HI> near Dijon, a heap of ruins;&mdash;all the bells collected together to be turned into cannon; every hou&s;e with the tri-coloured banner at the window, and the mot|to, <HI>"Lib.

<PB N="58" REF="031947_0008_0FEF5CE1903A76F8">
30 miles from Paris, my fears began to increa&s;e, and I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that Saint Port, the country re&s;idence of Mr. Morris, was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite on the other &s;ide of the Seine.&mdash;I was happy in getting under the protection of his roof, and determined to wait for his advice before I proceeded. The next day I received a polite note from him, informing me that I &s;hould meet with no difficulties; and on the 20th I entered Paris for the fir&s;t time. In&s;tead of the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle I expected, there was a dead calm, the road appeared de&s;erted, and not a carriage was to be &s;een in the &s;treets.&mdash;I waited on Mr. Morris, and heard with regret that <HI>Madame de la Fayette</HI> was con|fined near her country &s;eat in the South of France, with circum&s;tances even of <HI>cruelty and indecency.</HI> &mdash;He had made a private application in her favour to the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, and was an|&s;wered, "That &s;he was fortunate in being &s;o far from Paris, and that the greate&s;t &s;ervice her friends could render her, would be never to mention her name.</P>
<P>He &s;miled at my ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the French revolution, and &s;aid he would leave me to form my opinion from experience.</P>
<P>I began by attending regularly the <HI>debates</HI> of the <HI>Convention</HI>&mdash;I entered the <HI>Tribune</HI> for the fir&s;t time, with <HI>that re&s;pect one naturally feels at the idea of &s;eeing the rulers of a great nation.</HI>&mdash;I found the Pre&s;ident ringing his bell with all his might&mdash; half a dozen members &s;peaking at the &s;ame time, and when they could not be heard from the chair, they attacked each other. It proved to be a quarrel re&s;pecting a member who had been de|nounced.

The figures of the Roman worthies ornamented the walls, the bu&s;ts of <HI>Brutus,</HI> Le <HI>Pelletier,</HI> and <HI>Marat,</HI> &s;urrounded the Pre&s;ident's chair, oppo&s;ite was a large thing like a <HI>trunk</HI>&mdash; It was the <HI>Ark of the Covenant,</HI> covered with tri-coloured ribbons. I had an opportunity &s;ome days afterwards of &s;eeing on the <HI>place of the Ba&s;|tile</HI> a great <HI>&s;tone figure of Liberty</HI> and an <HI>immen&s;e trough,</HI> out of which the deputies drank large draughts of water to the <HI>Godde&s;s</HI> on the adoption of their la&s;t con&s;titution. There was a poor fel|low who narrowly e&s;caped being guillotined for ob&s;erving, that no doubt many wi&s;hed it was wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>National Convention</HI> I &s;oon perceived to be <HI>a farce;</HI> of the 749 members of whom it was fir&s;t compo&s;ed&mdash;155 had either given in their di&s;mi&s;|&s;ions, were guillotined, confined, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, or taken pri&s;oners: 228 from the 17 different comit&eacute;s for the tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s; a con&s;iderable num|ber are &s;ent into the departments, and tho&s;e who &s;et in the convention appear to meet merely for the purpo&s;e of giving an <HI>apparent &s;anction</HI> to the mea&s;ures of the <HI>comit&eacute; de &s;alut publique.</HI> The Pre|&s;ident is continually engaged in receiving addre&s;&s;es, patriotic donations, and in giving the honours of the &s;itting and the <HI>Bai&s;er fraternel.</HI> I was witne&s;s to a laughable &s;cene of this kind;&mdash;a deputation from <HI>St. Domingo</HI> entered the hall, it con&s;i&s;ted of a <HI>white</HI> man, a <HI>mulatto</HI> and a <HI>negro.

The fitting opened by read|ing the <HI>proc&egrave;s verbal</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Journals.</NOTE> of the preceding evening, by which it appeared that a deputation of Blacks had been received mo&s;t fraternally, and that it had unanimou&s;ly decreed, that a flag &s;hould be hung over the chair of the Pre&s;ident, on which &s;hould be a negro, a mulatto, and a French man holding up together the banner tri-coloured. Some bad ver&s;es were afterwards read in favour of the <HI>mountain,</HI> made by a woman, who attended the debates, and to this &s;ucceeded the epuration <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Purification.</NOTE> of the members.

one Chambertoy; as &s;oon as he began his an&s;wer, a black-guard looking fellow who was &s;itting next me got up, bawled out for the "parole"<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The right to &s;peak.</NOTE>&mdash;He &s;wore that Chambertoy was a ra&s;cal and an ari&s;|tocrat; another declared him to be as much of a patriot as the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; Chambertoy &s;aid a few words, when a woman got up behind him, and gave him the lie in plain terms. The mo&s;t violent noi&s;e and uproar &s;ucceeded, and I was con|vinced that Chambertoy would be turned out; at length, a child about thirteen or fourteen years old, a member of the club, mounted the tribune, made a long &s;peech, ob&s;erved that no per&s;on &s;hould be condemned, without being heard, and gained Chambertoy an opportunity of making his defence; he proved that he was one of the party who propo&s;ed the events of the 10th Augu&s;t (for they now con&s;ider as the greate&s;t merit in them|&s;elves, what they attributed to their king as the greate&s;t crime.) He &s;hewed a wound he had re|ceived at the Thuilleries, and was re-admitted with unbounded applau&s;e.&mdash;I was indebted, after|wards, to my being taken for an Engli&s;hman, for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Robe&s;pierre&mdash;they were &s;atisfied, on my &s;hewing a certificate from Mr. Morris, &s;igned by the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, and made way for a "brave American"&mdash;I had thus an apportunity of approaching very near Robe&s;pierre at the Jacobin club. He is a little man, very pale and thin, decently dre&s;&s;ed, in general, a light coloured great coat, and powder in his hair, much the appearance of a petty-fog|ing attorney: He was li&s;tened to with great at|tention, and brings out his words with an almo&s;t

<P>Frequently on leaving the convention, I pa&s;t through the <HI>garden of the Thuilleries</HI> to the <HI>place de la revolution,</HI> in order to get there after the <HI>exe|cutions</HI> had taken place, and was once or twice &s;o unfortunate as to be a witne&s;s of them. It is out of my power, my dear friend, to give you a compe|tent idea of this &s;cene.

<P>I attended many of the trials at the tribunal re|volution; you there find the forms of ju&s;tice, but none of the reality.

The jury con&s;i&s;ts of ten per&s;ons, the clerk reads the accu&s;ation.

One part is a de&s;ert, the other is plunged into the profounde&s;t apathy; and no where is there &s;o little appearance of inter|e&s;t in the affairs of France as in its own capital. There are from &s;ixteen to twenty <HI>&s;pectacles</HI> (thea|tres) every evening, and once each Decade all the theatres are opened gratis, to the populace, when &s;ome patriotic piece is given. The guillo|tine was generally the be&s;t attended; but to ren|der the piece &s;ufficiently amu&s;ing and wind up the e&s;prit revolutionaire, they are obliged at times to execute women, or &s;ome remarkable character.

<P>There is no truth of which I am &s;o perfectly convinced, as that the great majority of the people in France are already again&s;t the revolution, and would be happy to change for any government whatever, the <HI>horrid tyranny</HI> under which they &s;uf|fer. One of the members of the <HI>comite de &s;alut publique</HI> has been heard to &s;ay, "We know that nine out of ten are again&s;t us; but the tenth man &s;hall make the other nine march." A pre&s;ident of a jacobin club not far from Paris, has whi&s;per|ed to me <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A weak king is a &s;courge</NOTE> "Un roi foible e&s;t un fleau;" and I have never had an opportunity of conver&s;ing with any per&s;on above the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, who did not ex|ecrate the tyrants of the day. In the mean time, the military di&s;po&s;ition of the French, the atten|tion which is paid to the army, the unlimited pow|ers of the <HI>comite de &s;alut publique,</HI> and the immen&s;e riches on which they have &s;iezed, will give the ruling faction the means of making the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, and it is po&s;&s;ible they may involve in their own de&s;truction the ruin of all France. There was a time when, be&s;ides the Vendee, Bourdeaux, Toulon, Mar&s;eilles, Lyons, Stra&s;burg, were all for a counter revolution, and had the combined pow|ers, in&s;tead of the dete&s;table policy of di&s;member|ing France, been &s;eriou&s;ly occupied with the idea of putting Louis XVII. on the throne, it might have been effected. The Vendee was left to be de&s;troyed by numbers after giving repeated proofs of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing bravery. Bourdeaux was

on the point of declaring, but the mayor, who was a man of property, he&s;itated, Lyons became a le&s;|&s;on, Bourdeaux e&s;caped, but the mayor was guil|lotined; Mar&s;eilles &s;till &s;uffers under the wrath of the convention; Lyons, though obliged to adopt the language of the day, fought for royalty, &s;he expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was cruelly di&s;appointed; Stra&s;burg offered it&s;elf to general Wurm&s;er, if he would accept it for Louis XVII. His orders were to take it for his ma&s;ter: in the mean time the repre&s;entatives of the people entered the city and guillotined all who were &s;u&s;pected. The oppor|tunity has been neglected and humanity &s;hudders at the approach of the next campaign. For two years pa&s;t it has been expected, and even wi&s;hed by &s;ome, that the want of provi&s;ions would put an end to the exertions of France. Tho&s;e who en|tertained &s;uch hopes did not reflect that the army would be the la&s;t to &s;uffer and the innocent the fir&s;t victims. The papers mention but 5450 per&s;ons, but I know from good authority that there are at lea&s;t 15,000 confined at Paris, and tho&s;e who are arre&s;ted in the departments may amount to about 250,000. Would not the&s;e as the "Bouches inutiles"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">U&s;ele&s;s mouths.</NOTE> be the fir&s;t &s;acrificed? In &s;ome places already, the &s;oldiers receive good bread while the people are obliged to eat that which is made of po|tatoes and bran. The pro&s;pects of a famine in France were probably never more &s;erious than at the pre&s;ent moment, and the French may &s;uffer greatly before their harve&s;t; but they will not &s;tarve. In many cantons the bread is good and cheaper than in Switzerland: in Paris it is bad, but is &s;old at the maximum; in &s;ome few places the wheat was expended: the occa&s;ion of this dif|ference
<PB N="67" REF="031947_0017_0FEF5D29A2BA0B90">
is that all grain remains in requi&s;ition in each canton&mdash;wheat is in general &s;carce.

<P>I went to Paris by the northern road, and re|turned by <HI>Nevers, Moulins and Lyons;</HI> at the fir&s;t of the&s;e places many of the populace were intox|icated, and I could hardly get any per&s;on to exa|mine my pa&s;&s;port; they had ju&s;t taken up about 70 <HI>prie&s;ts;</HI> the&s;e unfortunate men had <HI>conformed</HI> to all the decrees of the Convention; &s;ome of them had married&mdash;<HI>many were old and &s;ome invalids;</HI> they were crowded with great inhumanity on board a batteau to be &s;ent to Bre&s;t. I a&s;ked one of them who attended, what was to be done with them? I believe, &s;aid he, <HI>they are going to drown them&mdash;this they call the New Bapti&s;m of Prie&s;ts. Moulins</HI> was formerly famous for its manufactories in cutlery; its commerce was de&s;troyed as well as that of every other city in France. <HI>But imagina|tion cannot conceive the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of Lyons; all that was beautiful in building, rich in commerce, or re&s;pectable in inhabitants, is totally de&s;troyed: the place de Belle Cour,</HI> formerly one of the <HI>mo&s;t

The executi|ons at Lyons, had already amounted to above 3000 per&s;ons, and to tho&s;e who &s;poke of mercy, the <HI>re|pre&s;entans</HI> had an&s;wered, "that there were 10,000 more to &s;uffer." There are two tribunals conti|nually employed in condemning. The "commi&s;|&s;ion militaire and the tribunal populaire." and wo|men, have been carried to the guillotine, to be witne&s;&s;es of the execution of their hu&s;bands, mere|ly for having &s;olicited their pardon.

city is Collot d'Herbois; this man was not long ago an inferior comedian, and has often acted at the theatres of Lyons and Geneva; he was the pre&s;ident of the comite that formed the la&s;t con|&s;titution; at pre&s;ent heads that party which is called by &s;ome <HI>Ultra Revolutionaire,</HI> and as the peo|ple here always join tho&s;e who go to the greate&s;t exce&s;&s;es, it is probable that Collot d'Herbois, He|bert, the author of the Pere Duchene, and their &s;et, may treat Robe&s;pierre and the Marates as they did the Bri&s;&s;otines. When any man gets to the top of power, he naturally feels him&s;elf in|tere&s;ted in the welfare of the country, and un|willingly adopts moderation as one of the means of increa&s;ing his popularity. Robe&s;pierre wi&s;hed to have a motion pa&s;t for liberating all tho&s;e who had been arre&s;ted without any grounds of accu|&s;ation; the number of whom you may ea&s;ily con|ceive to be very great, when for &s;ome time every per&s;on who denounced another received 100 livres. Such however was the clamour, that he was ob|liged to abandon the idea. He next, without ap|pearing him&s;elf, &s;et Camille des De&s;moulins to write again&s;t the violent party: he begins by de|claring him&s;elf a votary of the <HI>divine Marat.</HI> He was however expelled from the Jacobin Club for having mentioned <HI>comit&eacute; de clemence:</HI> and be|fore he could be re-admitted, was obliged to con|fe&s;s his error. It is the violent party, who, to amu&s;e the people, have &s;tarted the idea of a de|&s;cent into England. Robe&s;pierre declares, that the Engli&s;h only merit their contempt; that if they are de&s;irous of having their liberty, they are capa|ble of gaining it for them&s;elves, and if they are not, a de&s;cent into England would only be throw|ing them&s;elves into the &s;nares of Pitt.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">March.</NOTE>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031947_0020_0FEF5CE316A001E8">The Jacobin Club is the &s;ource of power, and tho&s;e who lead it govern France. It keeps up an intimate corre&s;pondence with all the inferior clubs in the different departments, and takes care that they &s;hall be formed of none but the vile&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant of the inhabitants, entirely devoted to it&s;elf. It is the &s;eat of information, gives what impre&s;&s;ion it plea&s;es, and a defeat in the north is repre&s;ented in the &s;outh as a victory. It has cau&s;ed all the mi&s;eries of France, and compo&s;ed as it is at pre&s;ent, no good can ever be expected from it: God knows what will be the end, and we are at a lo&s;s what to hope. The French ap|pear incapable of being free; the government of an u&s;urper only leads to new convul&s;ions; the people when fatigued with the pre&s;ent mode of government may change it for &s;omething new. Liberty is at pre&s;ent the fa&s;hion in France; you meet it at all the corners of the &s;treets; it is &s;tuck up in large characters on every hou&s;e; it &s;pouts at the theatre; it &s;truts at the opera; it is be|come a by-word&mdash;I never heard &s;o much, and never &s;aw &s;o little of it. The "Ancien Regime" has totally di&s;appeared, and decade is as much in vogue as if Sunday had never exi&s;ted. But will not a people who have, with &s;o much levity, a|bandoned their religion, forget in the &s;ame man|ner their liberty? Such appears to be the cha|racter of the French, a &s;oil where every thing flouri&s;hes for a time but nothing takes root; if well or ill directed, a character capable of the greate&s;t extremes of virtue or of vice.</P>
<P>I entered France one of the warme&s;t advocates of the revolution; I firmly believed that the great body of the people had ju&s;t ideas of liberty, were
<PB N="71" REF="031947_0021_0FEF5CF64B826D28">
acquainted with their rights, and after defeating the attempts of their enemies, would then e&s;tab|li&s;h an equal and well regulated government. I left it with &s;entiments of indignation, di&s;appoint|ment, and di&s;gu&s;t, convinced that there never was a people in the world &s;o little calculated to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at Paris, I found nothing &s;o intere&s;ting as the conver&s;ation of Mr.  <GAP DESC="blank">  He had been &s;o obliging before my arrival, as to take lodgings for me near his own hotel; and I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him every day. He was formerly exceedingly well received at court, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a great degree the confidence of its mini&s;ters, and has &s;ince been able to render him|&s;elf, though not liked, yet re&s;pected by all the parties that have &s;ucceeded: though a man of great abilities, he mu&s;t have found it difficult to have &s;teered &s;o far with &s;afety, through the &s;torm: and America is indebted to him for remaining in a &s;ituation, which, though none can fill it with more capacity, cannot but be particularly irk&s;ome to him. All tho&s;e for whom he could have felt any con&s;ideration, have either emigrated, been arre&s;t|ed or guillotined, and from being in the mo&s;t a|greeable &s;ociety, he is left with hardly an acquain|tance in France: the conduct he has pur&s;ued was the only one of avoiding all parties and maintaining in every re&s;pect the dignity of his &s;ituation. He par|ticularly dete&s;ted the Bri&s;&s;otines, who&s;e <HI>policy it was to draw America into the war,</HI> and had they not been guillotined, Genet might have done us con&s;iderable mi&s;chief. Mr.  <GAP DESC="blank">  read me &s;ome of his corre&s;pondence, and I was &s;urprized at the accuracy with which he had foretold the princi|pal

events of the revolution. The&s;e letters have fallen into the hands of per&s;ons, who from being, I believe, prejudiced in favour of the French, have neglected to pay them the attention which they &s;o highly merited.</P>
<P>A party of Americans have petitioned the Con|vention in favor of Tom Paine; they were invit|ed to the honours of the &s;itting, but could not be much flattered when a few days after a &s;et of ne|groes were received with far greater attention. As the French have no farther occa&s;ion for Common Sen&s;e, or the Rights of Man, Tom Paine &s;till re|mains in pri&s;on, where he abu&s;es Mr. Morris for not claiming him as an American, and amu&s;es him&s;elf, I'm told, with writing a book again&s;t Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is difficult to meet with beauty at Paris, all the pretty women are in requi&s;ition; they are con|fined and employed in making &s;hirts for the ar|my. I endeavoured to con&s;ole my&s;elf at the Gal|lery of Paintings, which is without exception the fine&s;t in the world&mdash;a collection of all the mo&s;t valuable paintings that exi&s;ted in France. Many Americans have been arre&s;ted on their fir&s;t enter|ing the Republic, and you are &s;earched half a dozen times before you are permitted to leave it. I returned by Geneva and found the violent party worthy imitators of their neighbours&mdash;they had found that their la&s;t project of a con&s;titution was impracticable, and accepted a new one, which the day after was violated. As there was a <HI>Ven|dee</HI> in France, they were determined to have one al&s;o. It con&s;i&s;ted of one hou&s;e and of one man, a Mr. Miquily; his hou&s;e was &s;urrounded, his

The Comit&eacute; provi&s;oire accompanied the <HI>Mar&s;ellois</HI> who went on this expedition in order to prevent mi&s;chief, but &s;uch was their impoten|cy, that a poor man was torn to pieces, before their faces for refu&s;ing to put on the Bonnet Rouge. On entering Switzerland I felt as if I had at length e&s;caped from a mad hou&s;e and again got into the &s;ociety of rea&s;onable beings.</P>
<P>I have without thinking, permitted my letter to run on to an immoderate length; you will I flat|ter my&s;elf, excu&s;e not only the length of it, but al&s;o the hurry in which I have written it.</P>
<P>The active life I led at Paris, and the excellent table of Mr. &mdash;, have been of &s;ervice to my health, and &s;ince I have found that exerci&s;e is a remedy, I &s;hall not remain idle; I leave this place immediately for Milan, where my carriage hor|&s;es have been arrived near two months. I ex|pect to pa&s;s the Holy week at Rome. The heat will &s;oon oblige me to leave Italy, when I propo&s;e going to Vienna, to which place I have excellent letters.</P>

<HEAD>MR. NOAH WEBSTER's ATTACK ON PORCUPINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>FROM THE MINERVA, <HI>Of New-York,</HI>
<DATE><HI>March</HI> 21, 1797.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN a late paper, we in&s;erted &s;entiments of this kind, that the putting up in the Coffee Hou&s;e, a card, on which was painted the Engli&s;h flag, was a low pitiful bu&s;ine&s;s, equalled only by the meanne&s;s of putting up a French flag, and that it is &s;ervile to be bandied about between the flags of different foreign nations. We ought to unite under our <HI>own flag</HI> and learn to be a nation.</P>
<P>Peter Porcupine has copied the paragraph with di&s;approbation, and &s;ays it contains more of <HI>vul|gar prejudice,</HI> and mi&s;take, than of ju&s;tice or good policy. He ob&s;erves that it is the <Q>quo animo,</Q> the intention of the act that &s;tamps its character. He would have no foreign flag hoi&s;t|ed, as a rallying point for malcontents again&s;t their own government; but to unite the Ameri|can Eagle with the Briti&s;h Lion again&s;t an am|bitious enemy, he thinks, would be an act that we need not be a&s;hamed of. He then &s;peaks of an alliance of that kind, as honourable and ad|vantageous to both parties.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="031947_0025_0FEF5D3F4DEED948">No comment will be made on the in&s;inuation of "Vulgar Prejudice," again&s;t the Editor of the Minerva. When Peter becomes acquainted with the editor's real character, he will learn, that in a combat of that kind, he him&s;elf mu&s;t certainly be the lo&s;er.</P>
<P>But we conte&s;t Peter's principles. It was &s;trong|ly &s;u&s;pected many months ago, that his principles are not very friendly to the independence of Ame|rica, and &s;till le&s;s &s;o, to the form of our govern|ment. This &s;u&s;picion has been greatly increa&s;|ed by the manner in which his gazette has been conducted. His retailing abu&s;e again&s;t la Fay|ette, who&s;e &s;ufferings (even &s;uppo&s;e him to have been in fault, which is doubtful or not admitted) are far too &s;evere, and call for the &s;ympathy of all mankind, denotes a man callous to the mi&s;e|ries of his &s;pecies, and extremely di&s;re&s;pectful to the opinions of the Americans, who entertain friend&s;hip and gratitude for la Fayette. We ob|&s;erve al&s;o whole columns of &s;ome of the fir&s;t num|bers of Peter's gazette, filled with <Q>apologies for the old government of France,</Q> that is, for the feudal &s;y&s;tem, though in a relaxed &s;tate, and for as corrupt a &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m as Eu|rope ever witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of Peter's pen, in attacking the de|mocratic factions of our country, has perfectly intoxicated him; and he mi&s;takes the <HI>&s;en&s;e of A|merica</HI> extremely, when he &s;uppo&s;es the danger we have e&s;caped of being pro&s;trated at the feet of France, will urge us to lay our country at the feet of Great-Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031947_0026_0FEF5D0BE4606890">No, Peter; your abu&s;ing the men who fought for our Independence, and your recommending the old Government of France, are not the means by which your popularity is to be maintained. The old government of France was not &s;o bad, as the Jacobin government, it is true; but there is a government different from both, which la Fayette &s;ought, and which the people of this coun|try will rejoice to &s;ee introduced, that is, a <HI>Free Government.</HI></P>
<P>As to an alliance with Great-Britain, we want none except what is dictated by commercial views. Here our intere&s;t, calls for mutual aid and pro|tection. So far as Great Britain will protect our trade, for her own &s;ake, we &s;hall gladly receive it, and no farther.</P>
<P>We a&s;k <HI>no favours</HI> of Great-Britain, nor of any other nation; for this would lay the foundation for more <HI>claims of gratitude,</HI> with which we have been outrageou&s;ly tormented by the French, and their hirelings. The United States and Great Britain are <HI>allied by intere&s;t.</HI> Setting a&s;ide &s;ame|ne&s;s of language, habits and private connections, no two countries are &s;o clo&s;ely united by com|mercial advantages. Nor can this union of in|tere&s;t, for a long time to come, have a competi|tor. It is as much for Great-Britain's intere&s;t (not to &s;ay more) to protect our ve&s;&s;els, as it is ours to have them protected. So far an alliance will ari&s;e out of nece&s;&s;ity and convenience, which will require very little modification by expre&s;s agreements. As to any thing like a general trea|ty, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, God forbid. Sooner may the United States be doomed to encounter

another eight years war for Independence, than hold the ble&s;&s;ing at the mercy of any foreign na|tion.</P>
<P>No, Peter; the man who writes this, once vo|luntarily bore arms to defend Independence, in pur&s;uance of the &s;ame principles, he <HI>fir&s;t</HI> propo&s;ed publicly the plan of a National Con&s;titution, per|&s;evering in the &s;ame principles, he a&s;&s;ailed the mon&s;ter, FACTION, the moment it appeared, in the in&s;idious form of popular clubs: and from that moment to this, he has never cea&s;ed to ex|po&s;e the artifices of the French agents to lay this country at the feet of France. With the &s;ame determined zeal and firmne&s;s, Peter, he now openly declares war again&s;t the man who dares to vilify the defenders of American Independence, or to propo&s;e an alliance that would commit that independence to the power of a foreign &s;tate, or to the fate of European conte&s;ts.</P>
<P>Americans de&s;ire peace, and rejoice that the flags of all nations &s;tream in their harbours. But the man who unites a foreign flag with that of his own country, on the territory of the United States, without an order of government, is a <HI>factious man,</HI> and has not the honour of his country at heart. This little emblem of national honour ought no more to be the &s;ignal for mobs and for violence in a neutral country.</P>
<P>Such, Peter, is my political creed&mdash;I know no party, but that of MY COUNTRY. My country is INDEPENDENT; it is for our intere&s;t, the intere&s;t of Great Britain, and of all Europe, that it &s;hould be &s;o; and the man who &s;eeks to tack it on any foreign country, to involve it in European broils,

<P>P. S. If Peter Porcupine's views are mi&s;taken, it belongs to him to remove the impre&s;&s;ions which his writings made on the genuine friends of this country.</P>

<P>YOU tell me and the public, that you, "with <HI>determined</HI> zeal and <HI>firmne&s;s,</HI> now openly <HI>declare war</HI> again&s;t me;" and that <Q>I mu&s;t <HI>certainly</HI> be the <HI>lo&s;er.</HI></Q> Softly, 'Squire Web&s;ter: it is not &s;o <HI>certain,</HI> perhaps, as you may imagine.

<P><PB N="80" REF="031947_0029_0FEF5D6BC99A2140">This, Sir, I de&s;ire you to look upon as a coun|ter-declaration; as a preparative for repul&s;ing the unprovoked attack. Your long, familiar, and mode&s;t addre&s;s &s;hould have been an&s;wered this day (notwith&s;tanding the <HI>certainty</HI> of my being the <HI>lo&s;er</HI>) did not the very extraordinary remarks it contains call for delay, in order to afford time for a full and fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, of much greater importance than the "political creed" of a news-monger.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME days ago I promi&s;ed you an an&s;wer to your Addre&s;s (or whatever el&s;e you may plea&s;e to call it) of the 21&s;t of March. It luckily matters little how this an&s;wer begins. Aware I &s;uppo&s;e of the uncouth manners of the man you were about to a&s;&s;ail, you kindly contrived that the rudene&s;s of your attack &s;hould furni&s;h an ample apology for his want of politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Your Addre&s;s treats of your important &s;elf, of me, and of the propo&s;ed alliance between the United States and Great Britain. This alliance is a &s;ubject of two much con&s;equence to be blend|ed with an enquiry into your and my character, principles, and conduct, I &s;hall therefore re&s;erve it for a &s;eparate letter; not lo&s;ing, however, the pre&s;ent opportunity of declaring, that your rea&s;on|ing,
<PB N="82" REF="031947_0031_0FEF5CCFCE8CCAE0">
in&s;tead of convincing me that I was mi&s;ta|ken, has &s;trengthened, as far as any thing in it|&s;elf contradictory can &s;trengthen, the opinion which gave &s;o much offence to your wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>You &s;et out with telling the public, that, <Q>in a late paper, we in&s;erted &s;entiments of this kind, that the putting up in the Coffee Hou&s;e, a card, on which was painted the Engli&s;h flag, was a <HI>low pitiful bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> equalled only by the <HI>meanne&s;s of putting up a French flag,</HI> and that it is &s;ervile to be bandied about between the flags of different foreign nations. We ought to unite under our <HI>own flag</HI> and learn to be a na|tion.</Q></P>
<P>You then complain of my having quoted the pa&s;&s;age <HI>"with di&s;approbation,"</HI> which with the application of the words <HI>vulgar prejudice,</HI> was, it &s;eems, a &s;tretch of pre&s;umption which your pride could not forgive.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, to venture to quote "with di&s;approbation" the oracular precepts flowing from the lips of the high prie&s;t of Mi|nerva, was rather bold; but (and with due &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion be it &s;poken) it was not &s;o much your advice as your <HI>partiality,</HI> your <HI>ver&s;atility,</HI> that I di&s;approved of. You have uttered &s;uch cart|loads of &s;entiments, that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible you &s;hould recollect one half of them; and as, in politics particularly, you are led by no fixed, no polar-&s;tar principle, it is as impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould ever be con&s;i&s;tent long together. Your &s;aying that the putting up of an Engli&s;h flag "was a <HI>low pitiful</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s," &s;ounds well; but did you &s;ay this when the <HI>French flag</HI> was
<PB N="83" REF="031947_0032_0FEF5CF95A85D738">
put up? No; you called that neither <HI>low</HI> nor <HI>pitiful:</HI> it was even honoured with your ap|plau&s;e, as far as a man, who looks upon him|&s;elf as the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all that is prai&s;e-worthy, can applaud the actions of others. The hoi&s;ting of the French flag was attended with fea&s;ting and noi&s;e, little inferior to what <HI>we</HI> have witne&s;&s;ed at the celebration of the murder of the Swi&s;s Guards: yet it e&s;caped your cen&s;ure: it was &s;uffered to hang very peaceably, and to re|ceive the adoration of the devout &s;ans-culottes of New-York: folly was permitted to revel at the foot, as it were, of the &s;hrine of wi&s;dom, for the &s;pace of three whole years, without re|ceiving either cha&s;ti&s;ement or rebuke. But, be|hold the difference! The moment a repre&s;enta|tion of the Briti&s;h flag appears, though painted on a bit of paper only, and intended merely to produce a little &s;port, you ca&s;t off your lethargic forbearance. Your patrioti&s;m, that patrioti&s;m, which &s;lept like a dormou&s;e, while the French flag was not only hanging up in the Coffee-Room, but was borne about your &s;treets to elections and town-meetings; that drow&s;y patrioti&s;m, which &s;eemed &s;carcely to perceive a banner of two yards &s;quare, though it bru&s;hed its very no&s;e, became all alive, took fire in a moment, upon &s;ight of a Briti&s;h flag in miniature.</P>
<P>You do, indeed, now talk about the <Q>mean|ne&s;s of putting up a French flag;</Q> but when do you find courage to do this? At the moment the people around you are got tired and a&s;hamed of their bauble. Far were you from calling it a <HI>meanne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o far from it that your voice was one of the mo&s;t &s;onorous in the ridiculous and
<PB N="84" REF="031947_0033_0FEF5CD32D455B00">
di&s;graceful hue-and-cry, rai&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who pulled it down, in the month of May, 1795.&mdash; On that occa&s;ion you very patrioticly ob&s;erved, that <Q><HI>it was hoped</HI> that the flags of the &s;i&s;ter re|publics would have <HI>remained undi&s;turbed</HI> by the <HI>enemies of our peace;</HI></Q> and then, on you go to expre&s;s your abhorrence of the conduct of the &s;acrilegious wretches who&s;e impious hands had re|moved them. And, recollect, that you took &s;pe|cial care not to utter a &s;yllable again&s;t the &s;avages, who attempted to murder a Briti&s;h Officer, to avenge "the <HI>mighty wrong.</HI>" To intrude your precepts, therefore, at this time; to &s;trut and hector over the poor fallen <HI>Tricolor,</HI> and to call on your readers to <Q><HI>unite under their</HI> own flag, <HI>and</HI> learn to be a nation,</Q> entitles you to but very little prai&s;e. Your advice comes too late. The patient was in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence, be|fore you ventured to pre&s;cribe: French priva|teers, jails, whips, and irons, had effectually re|moved the malady of the public, while you &s;tood fumbling its pul&s;e. Had the &s;ame &s;tupid admiration of the French, that prevailed, and that you participated in, for &s;everal years; had this admiration and its concomitant partiality &s;till exi&s;ted, you would never have dared (with all your <HI>heroi&s;m</HI>) to call the hoi&s;ting of their flag "a low pitiful bu&s;ine&s;s:" you would prudently have left that to a writer of le&s;s caution and more &s;incerity, re&s;erving to your&s;elf the agree|able ta&s;k of endeavouring to disfigure his motives and bla&s;t his fame.</P>
<P>And, was it then &s;uch a heinous offence to quote a writer of your &s;tamp <Q>with di&s;approba|tion,</Q> or apply to him the charge of <HI>vulgar
<PB N="85" REF="031947_0034_0FEF5CD4B654DBF8">
prejudice?</HI> It would be curious to hear, on what it is that you ground your right of exemption from all cen&s;ure and critici&s;m. Be&s;ides, to &s;ay that a man has adopted a <HI>vulgar prejudice,</HI> is cal|culated to give offence to no one but an illiterate booby, who does not know the meaning of the words, or a captious, inflated &s;elf-&s;ufficient pe|dant. Yet it is this phra&s;e, and this alone, that has provoked you to &s;eek retaliation, and retalia|tion, too, of the mo&s;t ba&s;e and malicious &s;pecies. &mdash;<Q>We <HI>conte&s;t</HI> (&s;ay you, after declaring that <HI>I am unable to cope with you</HI>) We conte&s;t Pe|ter's principles. It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected <HI>many months ago,</HI> that his principles <HI>are</HI> not ve|ry friendly to the independence of America, and &s;till le&s;s &s;o to the form of our govern|ment.</Q></P>
<P>The grammatical inaccuracy of this la&s;t &s;en|tence, though fallen from the pen of a <HI>language-maker,</HI> it would be foreign to my purpo&s;e to re|mark on: it is the &s;lander it conveys, that it is my duty to expo&s;e.&mdash;<HI>"It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected."</HI> This is the true go&s;&s;iping, calumniating &s;tyle. All verbal a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;peak in the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive voice,</HI> that, what they cannot prove, they may at la&s;t throw on public report. If you had &s;aid, <Q><HI>I</HI> &s;u&s;pected many months ago,</Q> though it would have led to a detection, you would have acted more like a man; and this might have been expected too, in a volunteer of your <Q>determined zeal and firmne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>However, as you are very fond of the pom|pous plural number and pa&s;&s;ive voice, perhaps, it is but fair to &s;uppo&s;e, that you mean to inti|mate,
<NOTE PLACE="foot">March.</NOTE>
<PB N="86" REF="031947_0035_0FEF5D20BB2DDF30">
that <HI>you</HI> &s;u&s;pected my principles <HI>many months ago;</HI> and, if this was really the ca&s;e, pray how came you to recommend my pamphlets to the peru&s;al of your readers, as the be&s;t antedote to the anarchical principles of the enemies of the government? <HI>How many</HI> months ago was it that your penetration made the grand di&s;covery? When I propo&s;ed publi&s;hing a paper, which was no more than about <HI>&s;ix weeks</HI> anterior to the date of your Addre&s;s, you told the public in an exulting manner, that I &s;hould <Q>prove a terri|ble &s;courge to the patriots,</Q> meaning Bache, Greenleaf, and all the antifederal crew. <HI>Six weeks</HI> 'Squire Web&s;ter, is not <HI>many months.</HI> If you really &s;u&s;pected my enmity to the government, and to the independence of America, you were a very great hypocrite, if not &s;omething of a traitor, to applaud my undertaking; and, if on the other hand, you had no &s;uch &s;u&s;picion, and have now feigned it merely for the purpo&s;e of re|venging what your haughtine&s;s has con&s;trued into an affront, I leave the public to determine what name you are worthy of.</P>
<P>But, you do not &s;top at &s;u&s;picions. You &s;eem to have fore&s;een that your readers would require &s;omething more than mere &s;urmi&s;e, and you were determined to furni&s;h it. When a man is once got into mi&s;chief, he does not &s;tick at trifles. &mdash;<Q>This &s;u&s;picion, &s;ay you, has been great|ly encrea&s;ed by the manner in which Peter's Gazette has been conducted.</Q>&mdash;Now, who, upon reading this, would not imagine, that my Gazette had di&s;covered a departure from the principles which I had before profe&s;&s;ed; a &s;pirit ho&s;tile to the government of this country, or
<PB N="87" REF="031947_0036_0FEF5CD64185B5A0">
at lea&s;t unfriendly to it. Who would imagine that you, or any other man who wi&s;hes to pre|&s;erve the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to candour, would have ventured to accu&s;e another of enmity to the government upon a foundation &s;lighter than this? Yet you can produce no &s;uch thing. Af|ter having turned and rummaged my poor gazette over and over again, pryed into every paragraph, and weighed each &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, all you can collect to <HI>"increa&s;e"</HI> your &s;u&s;picion, is, my <Q>re|tailing abu&s;e again&s;t <HI>la Fayette,</HI></Q> and my pub|li&s;hing whole columns, <Q>filled with apologies for the old government of France!</Q> as if the &s;entiments of a man, re&s;pecting la Fayette and the French monarchy, formed a criterion where|by to e&s;timate his attachment to the Con&s;titution and Independence of the United States! Futile indeed mu&s;t be the charge, that has no other &s;upport than &s;uch round-about kind of evidence as this.</P>
<P>I certainly might pa&s;s over with &s;ilent con|tempt, what, if &s;trictly true, goes not an inch towards ju&s;tifying your malignant in&s;inuation; but, as you have been mean enough to take &s;helter under the popular, the <Q>vulgar preju|dice,</Q> that prevails in favour of la Fayette and again&s;t monarchical governments, I &s;hall take one &s;tep out of my way, in order to convince the public, that I &s;hall never decline a combat with Noah Web&s;ter, though backed with the mi&s;|placed partiality of millions.</P>
<P>What you are plea&s;ed to term, <Q>retailing <HI>abu&s;e</HI> again&s;t la Fayette,</Q> and, in another place, <Q><HI>vilifying</HI> the defenders of American Indepen|dence;</Q>
<PB N="88" REF="031947_0037_0FEF5D2FA7EC1BA8">
all this put together, is, the publi&s;h|ing of a &s;peech of Mr. Burke, on the motion brought forward in the Briti&s;h Parliament, for the purpo&s;e of prevailing on the king to inter|cede for la Fayette's relea&s;e. This &s;peech was publi&s;hed in my Gazette, of the 7th March; and, &s;o far from its being an abu&s;ive, vilifying ha|rangue, though it is one of tho&s;e pieces of ora|tory, that will for ages be an ornament to the proceedings of the Briti&s;h Commons, it is not more remarkable for its eloquence than for its <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>You, indeed, tell us, that la Fayette's being "<HI>in fault,</HI> is <HI>doubtful,</HI> or <HI>not admitted:</HI>"&mdash;and in this &s;hort &s;entence, you have given a more com|plete &s;pecimen of the <HI>equivoque</HI> than is to be found in Boileau's famous poem on the &s;ubject. In the fir&s;t place, we know not whether you expre&s;s the opinion of others, or your own: next, if you are under&s;tood as expre&s;&s;ing your own opinion, you declare the que&s;tion doubtful, you do not admit the fault, and yet you do not venture to declare your friend innocent: la&s;tly, &s;hould &s;ome warm partizan, whether royali&s;t or republican, call you to account for he&s;itating on the &s;ubject, &s;till you have a &s;hift left; for you do not &s;ay, or even hint, whether it be la Fayette's crimes again&s;t the king, or tho&s;e again&s;t the a&s;&s;embly, that you doubt of.&mdash;It was in the wars, I pre&s;ume, that you learnt this precaution, of always &s;e|curing a &s;afe retreat.</P>
<P>To one, who &s;o carefully di&s;gui&s;es his &s;entiments, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to make a &s;atisfactory re|ply: however, &s;uppo&s;ing you to doubt of la
<PB N="89" REF="031947_0038_0FEF5D46B928EF40">
Fayette's fault with re&s;pect to his &s;overeign, I would a&s;k you, where you have lived for the&s;e ten years la&s;t pa&s;t? To hear you &s;tart <HI>doubts</HI> on this &s;ubject, one would imagine you had dwelt in a dormitory or a hermitage; that you had been ab&s;orbed in heavenly meditation; that your ve&s;&s;el (as the puritans call it) had been a re&s;evoir of god|line&s;s, in place of being what, alas! it is, a mere channel for news.</P>
<P>To enter into a minute examination of la Fay|ett's conduct, during his &s;hort-lived career in the French revolution, would be giving an impor|tance to his character which it does not de&s;erve. It is true that he always was an underworker, like many others; and, therefore, is not to be reckoned among the mi&s;creant Mirabeaus, Con|dorcets, &amp;c. who&s;e puppet he was; but, he ne|verthele&s;s comes in for a con&s;iderable &s;hare of that cen&s;ure which is due to a combination of ambiti|ous men, determined to build their own fame and greatne&s;s on the ruins of a mighty empire, without remor&s;e for the mi&s;eries it mu&s;t produce. One fact, when the merits of la Fayette are to be tried, ought never to be forgotten: it was his revoluti|onary brain that conceived the French <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> of which no more need be &s;aid, than that they are the very text from which Tom Paine has ever &s;ince been preaching the duty of <HI>holy in&s;ur|rection.</HI></P>
<P>I would willingly believe that gratitude for the &s;ervices which la Fayette rendered America, has now called forth your compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;uf|ferings, and your re&s;entment again&s;t my paper, or rather again&s;t me. I would willingly trace your
<PB N="90" REF="031947_0039_0FEF5CFCB005FDB8">
a&s;perity back to this amiable &s;ource; but your pa&s;t conduct tells me that I &s;hould attempt it in vain. How come you to be grateful to la Fayette <HI>alone?</HI> Has no other friend to the American re|volution lain on the damp floor of a dungeon? Never did you, (with &s;hame be it &s;poken, Web|&s;ter) never did you utter a word of compa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate friendle&s;s Louis XVI. when this &s;ame la Fayette was leading him in triumph from pri&s;on to pri&s;on. Never did you talk of cruel treatment, when the Queen of France was dragged in &s;low proce&s;&s;ion to Paris, while the myrmidons of this &s;ame la Fayette carried the gha&s;tly heads of her murdered guards before her. No; you rejoiced at all this; and yet, I believe, no one will have the impudence to pretend, that la Fayette's &s;ervices to this country, were a millionth part &s;o great as tho&s;e of poor Louis and his con&s;ort.&mdash;Nay, you &s;aw the head of this fallen prince roll from the &s;caf|fold; you &s;aw his family cut off one by one; you &s;aw his innocent child lingering in a dungeon, robbed of &s;leep, terrified four times an hour with orders to prepare for death, and at la&s;t you &s;aw his bloated and livid corp&s;e &s;tretched in a dung|cart.&mdash;On all this you looked with a philo&s;phic eye. Not a tear e&s;caped you; not a groan, not a &s;igh, was heard from the tender-hearted <HI>Miner|va,</HI> who now tells us that "<HI>la Fayette's</HI> &s;ufferings call for the <HI>"&s;ympathy of all mankind."</HI></P>
<P>No, Sir, nor did you ever feel any thing wor|thy the name of compa&s;&s;ion for la Fayette him&s;elf, or you would have expre&s;&s;ed your abhorrence of the cruel and &s;avage mea&s;ures adopted again&s;t him and his family by the pretended republicans of France. That was the time for your gratitude
<PB N="91" REF="031947_0040_0FEF5D233576B8C8">
and friend&s;hip to have &s;hown it&s;elf. You, who <Q>once voluntarily bore arms to defend indepen|dence, and who now with determined zeal and firmne&s;s openly declares war again&s;t the man who <HI>dares</HI> vilify the defenders of it,</Q> among whom you count la Fayette; you, Sir, &s;hould have &s;tood forth again&s;t the then popular Convention, who had fixed a price on the head of your friend; who had, by law, authorized the citizens to &s;hoot him, or knock his brains out, like a dog; nay, had impo&s;ed it on them as a duty. Then was the time for the <HI>blue-eyed Maid</HI> to gra&s;p her javelin, and &s;helter the injured hero beneath her ample &s;hield. As &s;he neglected to do this; as &s;he &s;hrank from the encounter with popular fury; as &s;he tamely yielded to the <HI>vulgar prejudice</HI> that then prevailed in favour of every act of the mock legi&s;|lators of France, however cruel and infamous, &s;he will now receive but little applau&s;e, from men of &s;en&s;e, for her cen&s;ure of the Emperor of Germany, who&s;e title alone, &s;he well knows, will, with the gro&s;s of <HI>her readers,</HI> be a &s;ufficient apology for any departure from decency and truth.</P>
<P>No, Sir; it is too clear, that a de&s;ire to ingra|tiate your&s;elf with the deceived part of the public, together with that of injuring me, led you to bring forward the &s;talking hor&s;e la Fayette, and not any friend&s;hip, gratitude, or compa&s;&s;ion that you entertained for him. This your manner of proceeding inconte&s;tibly proves. Fir&s;t, you pre|tend to &s;u&s;pect my enmity to the independence of America; then you artfully produce my publi|tion of Mr. Burke's cen&s;ure of la Fayette, as a proof of that enmity, leaving your readers to draw the natural conclu&s;ion, that I had "retailed
<PB N="92" REF="031947_0041_0FEF5D25B1C53600">
abu&s;e" again&s;t him, merely <HI>for his having fought in the cau&s;e of Independence.</HI>&mdash;Never did envy and revenge &s;ugge&s;t a ba&s;er in&s;inuation, or one, the fal&s;hood of which was more ea&s;y to detect.</P>
<P>If I bear malice again&s;t la Fayette, if I have publi&s;hed a cen&s;ure on him, if I have "<HI>retailed abu&s;e</HI> again&s;t him," as you are plea&s;ed to call it, on account of his having &s;erved here, during the revolutionary war; pray, does it not follow, that I mu&s;t bear the &s;ame malice, and feel the &s;ame inclination to cen&s;ure every one who aided the cau&s;e of Independence? If &s;uch be the motive from which I act, I certainly could look round among tho&s;e who did more injury to the cau&s;e of Great Britain in one day, nay in one minute, than la Fayette did during the war, or could have done in his whole life time. I call on you, then, to &s;ay whether I have ever, directly or indi|rectly, di&s;covered an inclination to defame any man, merely becau&s;e he was in&s;trumental in e&s;tabli&s;hing the independence of this country. Have I ever attempted to a&s;per&s;e, have I ever hinted any thing to the di&s;honour of, Mr. Jay, Mr. Adams, or General Wa&s;hington? The&s;e gentlemen, the mo&s;t eminent actors on the great drama of the revolution, have all been attacked, &s;landered and abu&s;ed, by tho&s;e who are among the eulogi&s;ts of la Fayette; and I leave the public to determine, who has &s;hown the mo&s;t diligence, zeal and courage, in defence of their characters, <HI>Peter Porcupine</HI> or <HI>Noah Web&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame view it was, that you cho&s;e to comment on my having publi&s;hed <Q>an
<PB N="93" REF="031947_0042_0FEF5CD8A4F549D8">
apology for the old government of France,</Q> which you a&s;&s;ert to be <Q>as corrupt a &s;y&s;tem of <HI>de&s;poti&s;m</HI> as Europe ever witne&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>To call the old government of France, which all the civilians have reckoned among the <HI>limited monarchies;</HI> to call this government a <HI>de&s;poti&s;m,</HI> argues a mind &s;trongly tinctured with the prin|ciples of liberty and equality; but, to &s;ay that it was as corrupt a &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m <HI>as Europe ever &s;aw,</HI> puts you upon a level with the &s;lander|ous haranguers of the &s;uburbs of St. Antoine and St. Marceaw.

<P>You do, however, allow that there is one &s;pecies of government &s;till wor&s;e than that of the French monarchy; and here your con&s;i&s;tency is well worth attention.

You had forgot, or you never knew, the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t years of the French revolution. You contemplate your friend in the dungeon of Almutz only; you do not look back, and behold him in the tribune of the Jacobin Club at Paris. la Fayette was one

<P><Q>The old government, &s;ay you was not &s;o bad as the Jacobin government, it is true; but there is a government different from both, which la Fayette <HI>&s;ought,</HI> and which the people of this country will rejoice to &s;ee introduced; that is, a <HI>Free Government.</HI></Q>&mdash;Now, &s;ir, what do you mean by a government that la Fayette <HI>&s;ought?</HI> To hear you, one would imagine, that he had been foiled in &s;ome precious project for the good of his country; that his councils had been rejected, and him&s;elf per&s;ecuted on account of his probity and wi&s;dom; whereas the very rever&s;e of all this was the ca&s;e. His projects &s;ucceeded to the utmo&s;t of his wi&s;hes. The famous <HI>rights of man,</HI> of which he was the propo&s;er, became a fundamental law, was &s;anctioned and &s;worn to by the whole nation. The Con&s;titution, grounded on tho&s;e rights, he &s;aw completed, and he retired from the legi&s;lative &s;cene well plea&s;ed with his work. In &s;hort, the government he <HI>&s;ought,</HI> he <HI>obtained,</HI> and a mo&s;t &s;tu|pid, ba&s;e and cruel government it was. A govern|ment that acknowledged the horrid act of in&s;ur|rection to be a &s;acred duty, and that, in its prac|tice, made a beginning in that career of &s;acrilege, plunder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which has been &s;o unre|mittingly pur&s;ued by &s;ucceeding and more &s;uc|ce&s;sful u&s;urpers. And this is what you call a <HI>Free Government;</HI> one that the people of America will be glad to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed in France! If the people of America are &s;illy or wicked enough to enter|tain any &s;uch wi&s;h, I &s;incerely hope it may not be

accompli&s;hed. The government they have now in France, is certainly a mo&s;t abominable de&s;pot|i&s;m, but it is not &s;o de&s;tructive either in principle or practice, as that which la Fayette <HI>&s;ought</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to form.</P>
<P>What involves you in the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies and contradictions is evident enough: you were a long time a very great admirer of the French revolu|tion. I will not &s;ay that I could make <HI>you</HI> blu&s;h, but I am certain I could make your friends blu&s;h, by a quotation from your paper in <HI>approbation</HI> of Tom Paine's <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> the manuel of Jaco|bini&s;m. Exactly how far you went hand in hand with the revolutioni&s;ts, I know not; nor do I be-believe that you your&s;elf know. You are in the predicament of a great many others, who, when they are a&s;ked what they approved and what they did not approve, an&s;wer, that they went <HI>as far as la Fayette,</HI> but <HI>no farther;</HI> and God knows that was far enough.</P>
<P>You, and all tho&s;e who thus pinned their poli|tical faith on the &s;leeve of this unfledged &s;tate&s;|man, would &s;till have been revolutioni&s;ts in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term, had not the u&s;urpers been preparing to extend their fraternal gra&s;p to this government and country. Till then you care|fully avoided &s;aying a word again&s;t them: all their mo&s;t atrocious deeds were &s;moothed over; their plundering decrees, their invitations to re|bellion, were all right, till they ca&s;t their looks this way: then your eyes were opened at once: like Bailly and la Fayette, you adored the holy right of in&s;urrection, till it began to operate again&s;t your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="031947_0045_0FEF5CE808CD1128">From this digre&s;&s;ion, which your &s;traggling from your &s;ubject invited, I return to examine more clo&s;ely the accu&s;ation of having publi&s;hed "an apology for the old government of France." This apology is contained in certain extracts from Gifford's an&s;wer to lord Lauderdale's letters to the Peers of Scotland. The writer ob&s;erves with great ju&s;tne&s;s, that <Q>one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful modes of <HI>exciting &s;entiments favourable to the French Revolution,</HI> has been the imputation of every vice creative of di&s;gu&s;t to the old govern|ment of France.</Q> He then notices the &s;can|dalous neglect of candour and truth, that has been di&s;played in the performance of this ta&s;k: the unfair mode of arguing that has been adopted, and the exaggeration and calumny that has im|po&s;ed on the uninformed. The object of all this, it is evident, has been not only to ju&s;tify the re|volutioni&s;ts in de&s;troying the monarchy, but to in|culcate a belief, that the people, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, are &s;till gainers by the de&s;po|ti&s;m that has been rai&s;ed on its ruins.</P>
<P>To expo&s;e the falacy of this rea&s;oning, to rec|tify the mi&s;conceptions of the weak, and to de|tect the mi&s;repre&s;entations of the wicked, Mr. Gifford enters into a candid examination of the &s;ubject, during which he proves, and that mo&s;t &s;atisfactorily, that the acts of oppre&s;&s;ion imputed to the French government, were generally, not to &s;ay always, exaggerated; that in many in&s;tan|ces the charges were totally unfounded, and even ridiculous; that in &s;hort, to the happine&s;s of France, no revolution was nece&s;&s;ary; and of cour&s;e, that this dreadful &s;courge is to be a&s;crib|ed to the ambition and treachery of the u&s;urp|ing legi&s;lators.</P>

The elegant and convinc|ing writer is an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and con&s;equently knows how to e&s;timate the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom full as well, if not better than you. He is <HI>a &s;cho|lar,</HI> and, which is more as to the pre&s;ent point, the author of a hi&s;tory of France, which has re|ceived the applau&s;e of the whole literary world, and which is the fruit of a long and painful re|&s;earch, during many years of re&s;idence in that country: of cour&s;e his knowledge (particularly of whatever relates to the monarchy of France) is not to be &s;unk to a competition with that of a man, the greate&s;t extent of who&s;e travels has been from Connecticut to New-York, and the utmo&s;t exertion of who&s;e talents is to be &s;ought for in the compilation of a &s;chool-book.

<HEAD>WILL AND TESTAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I took up the calling that I now follow, I have received about forty threatening letters; &s;ome talk of fi&s;ticuff, others of kicks, but far the greater part menace me with out-right murder. Several friends (whom by the bye I &s;incerely thank) have called to caution me again&s;t the lurking cut-throats; and it &s;eems to be the per&s;ua&s;ion of every one, that my brains are to be knocked out the fir&s;t time I ven|ture from home in the dark.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e terrific circum&s;tances, it is impo&s;&s;ible that Death &s;hould not &s;tare me in the face: I have therefore got my&s;elf into as good a &s;tate of preparati|on as my &s;inful profe&s;&s;ion will, I am afraid, admit of; and as to my worldly affairs, I have &s;ettled them in the following <HI>WILL,</HI> which I publi&s;h, in order that my dear friends, the Legatees, may, if they think them&s;elves injured or neglected, have an opportunity of complaining before it be too late.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="031947_0057_0FEF5D614C2D6A98">IN the name of Fun, Amen. I PETER POR|CUPINE, Pamphleteer and News-Monger, being (as yet) &s;ound both in body and in mind, do, this fifteenth day of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year of our LORD, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-&s;even, make, declare, and publi&s;h, this my LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT, in manner, form, and &s;ub&s;tance following; to wit:</P>
<P>IN PRIMIS, I LEAVE my body to Doctor Michael Lieb, a member of the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, to be by him di&s;&s;ected (if he knows how to do it) in pre&s;ence of the Rump of the Democratic Society, In it they will find a heart that held them in ab|horrence, that never palpitated at their threats, and that, to its la&s;t beat, bade them defiance. But my chief motive for making this beque&s;t it, that my &s;pirit may look down with contempt on their cannibal-like triumph over a breathle&s;s corps.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> As I make no doubt that the above &s;aid Doctor Lieb (and &s;ome other Doctors that I could menti|on) would like very well to &s;kin me, I reque&s;t that they, or one of them, may do it, and that
<PB N="109" REF="031947_0058_0FEF5CEA6B8138E8">
the &s;aid Lieb's father may tan my &s;kin; after which I de&s;ire my Executors to have &s;even copies of my Works complete, bound in it, one copy to be pre&s;ented to the five Sultans of France, one to each of their Divans, one to the Governor of Penn&s;ylvania, to citizens Maddi&s;on, Giles, and Gallatine one each, and the remaining one to the Democratic Society of Philadelphia, to be care|fully pre&s;erved among their archieves.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councils of the City of Philadelphia, I bequeath all the &s;turdy young huck&s;ters, who infe&s;t the market, and who to maintain their ba&s;tards, tax the hone&s;t inhabi|tants many thou&s;and pounds annually. I reque&s;t them to take them into their wor&s;hipful keeping; to cha&s;ten their bodies for the good of their &s;ouls; and moreover, to keep a &s;harp look-out after their gallants: and remind the latter of the old proverb: <HI>Touch pot, touch penny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To T&mdash; J&mdash;&s;on, Philo&s;opher, I leave a curious Norway Spider, with a hundred legs and nine pair of eyes; likewi&s;e the fir&s;t black cut-throat general he can catch hold of, to be flead alive, in order to determine with more certainty the real cau&s;e of the dark colour of his &s;kin: and &s;hould the &s;aid T&mdash; J&mdash;&s;on &s;urvive Ban|neker the Almanack-Maker; I reque&s;t he will get the brains of &s;aid Philomath carefully di&s;&s;ected, to &s;atisfy the world in what re&s;pects they differ from tho&s;e of a white man.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the Philo&s;ophical Society of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a correct copy of Thornton's plan for aboli&s;hing the u&s;e of the Engli&s;h language and for introducing in its &s;tead a republican one, the repre&s;entative characters of which bear a
<PB N="110" REF="031947_0059_0FEF5D49361FED30" MS="y">
&s;trong re&s;emblance to pot-hooks and hangers; and for the di&s;covery of which plan, the &s;aid &s;ociety did, in the year 1793, grant to the &s;aid lan|guage maker 500 dollars premium.&mdash;It is my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that the copy of this valuable performance, which I hereby pre&s;ent, may be &s;hown to all the travelling literati, as a proof of the ingenuity of the author and of the wi&s;dom of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Doctor Benjamin Ru&s;h, I will and bequeath a copy of the Cen&s;or for January, 1797; but, upon the expre&s;s condition, that he does not is anywi&s;e or gui&s;e, either at the time of my death, or <HI>Six months after,</HI> pretend to &s;peak, write or publi&s;h an eulogium on me, my calling or character, either literary, military, civil, or political.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To my dear fellow labourer Noah Web&s;ter, gen|"tleman-citizen," <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and News-man, I will and bequeath a progno&s;ticating barometer of curious con&s;truction and great utility, by which, at a &s;ingle glance, the &s;aid Noah will be able to di&s;cern the exact &s;tate that the public mind will be in the en&s;u|ing year, and will thereby be enabled to <HI>trim by degrees</HI> and not expo&s;e him&s;elf to detection, as he now does by his &s;udden lee-&s;hore tacks. I likewi&s;e bequeath to the &s;aid "gentleman citi|zen," &s;ix Spani&s;h milled dollars, to be expended on a new plate of his portrait at the head of his &s;pelling-book, that which graces it at pre&s;ent being &s;o ugly that it &s;cares the children from their le&s;&s;ons; but this legacy is to be paid him only upon condition that he leave out the title of <HI>'Squire,</HI> at the bottom of &s;aid picture, which is ex|tremely odious in an American &s;chool-book, and mu&s;t inevitably tend to corrupt the political prin|ciples
<PB N="111" REF="031947_0060_0FEF5D66E99128B8">
of the republican babies that behold it. And I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire, exhort and conjure the &s;aid 'Squire-news-man, to change the tittle of his paper, <HI>The Minerva,</HI> for that of <HI>The Political Centaur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To F. A. Mughlenburg, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Speaker of a late hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, I leave a mo&s;t &s;uperbly fini&s;hed &s;tatue of Janus.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Tom the Tinker, I leave a liberty cap, a tri-colored cockade, a wheel-barrow full of oy&s;ters, and a hog&s;head of grog: I al&s;o leave him three blank checks on the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, leav|ing to him the ta&s;k of <HI>filling them up;</HI> reque&s;ting him, however, to be rather more merciful than he has &s;hown him&s;elf heretofore.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the Governor of Penn&s;ylvania, and to the late Pre&s;ident and Ca&s;hier of the Bank of the &s;aid State, as to joint legatees, I will and bequeath that good old proverb: <HI>Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy.</HI> And this legacy I have cho&s;en for the&s;e worthy gentlemen, as the only thing about which I am &s;ure they will never di&s;agree.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To T&mdash; Coxe, of Philadelphia, citizen, I will and bequeath a crown of hemlock, as a re|compence for his attempt to throw an odium on the admini&s;tration of General Wa&s;hington; and I mo&s;t po&s;itively enjoin on my executors, to &s;ee that the &s;aid crown be &s;haped exactly like that which this &s;pindle-&s;hanked legatee wore before Gen. Howe, when he made his triumphal entry into Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Thomas Lord Bradford (otherwi&s;e called Goo&s;y Tom), Book&s;eller, Printer, News-man,
<PB N="112" REF="031947_0061_0FEF5CDD8D418A18">
and member of the Philo&s;ophical Society of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a copy of the Peerage of Great Britain, in order that the &s;aid Lord Thomas may the more exactly a&s;cer|tain what probability there is of his &s;ucceeding to the seat, which his noble relation now fills in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To all and &s;ingular the authors in the United States, whether they write ver&s;e or pro&s;e, I will and bequeath a copy of my Life and adventures; and I advi&s;e the &s;aid authors to &s;tudy with particular care the 40th and 41&s;t pages thereof; more e&s;pecially and above all things, I exhort and conjure them never to <HI>publi&s;h it together,</HI> though the book&s;eller &s;hould be a &s;aint.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Edmund Randolph, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late Secretary of State, to Mr. J. A. Dallas, Secretary of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, and to his Excellency Tho|mas Mifflin, Governor of the &s;aid unfortunate State, I will and bequeath, to each of them, a copy of the &s;ixteenth paragraph of Fauchet's <HI>intercepted letter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Citizen John Swanwick, member of Con|gre&s;s, by the will and con&s;ent of the &s;overeign people, I leave bills of Exchange on London to an enormous amount; they are <HI>all prote&s;ted,</HI> in|deed, but if properly managed, may be turned to good account. I likewi&s;e bequeath to the &s;aid John a &s;mall treati&s;e by an Italian author, where|in the &s;ecret of plea&s;ing the ladies is developed, and reduced to a mere mechanical operation, with|out the lea&s;t dependance on the precarious aid of the pa&s;&s;ions. Hoping that the&s;e in&s;tances of my liberality will produce, in the mind of the little
<PB N="113" REF="031947_0062_0FEF5CDF19063C18">
legi&s;lator, effects quite different from tho&s;e pro|duced therein by the king of Great Britain's pen|&s;ion to his parents.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the editor of the Bo&s;ton Chronicle, the New York Argus, and the Philadelphia Merch|ants' Adverti&s;er, I will and bequeath one ounce of mode&s;ty and love of truth, to be equally divid|ed between them. I &s;hould have been more libe|ral in this beque&s;t, were I not well a&s;&s;ured, that one ounce is more than they will ever make u&s;e of.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Franklin Bache, editor of the Aurora of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a &s;mall bundle of French a&s;&s;ignats, which I brought with me from the country of equality. If the&s;e &s;hould be too light in value for his pre&s;&s;ing exigencies, I de&s;ire my executors, or any one of them, to be&s;tow on him a &s;econd part to what he has lately received in Southwark; and as a further proof of my good will and affection, I reque&s;t him to accept of a gag and a brand new pair of fetters, which if he &s;hould refu&s;e, I will and bequeath him in lieu thereof&mdash;my malediction.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To my beloved countrymen, the people of Old England, I will and bequeath a copy of Doctor Prie&s;tley's Charity Sermon <HI>for the benefit of poor Emigrants;</HI> and to the &s;aid preaching philo&s;opher him&s;elf, I bequeath a heart full of di&s;appointment, grief and de&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the good people in France, who remain attached to their &s;overeign, particularly to tho&s;e among whom I was ho&s;pitably received, I be|queath each a good &s;trong dagger; hoping mo&s;t &s;incerely that they may yet find courage enough
<PB N="114" REF="031947_0063_0FEF5D15DF1156B0">
to carry them to the hearts of their abominable tyrants.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To citizen M&mdash;oe, I will and bequeath my chamber looking-gla&s;s. It is a plain but exceed|ing true mirror: in it he will &s;ee the exact like|ne&s;s of a traitor, who has bartered the honour and intere&s;t of his country to a perfidious and &s;avage enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the republican Britons, who have fled from the hands of ju&s;tice in their own country, and who are a &s;candal, a nui&s;ance and a di&s;grace to this, I bequeath hunger and nakedne&s;s, &s;corn and reproach; and I do hereby po&s;itively enjoin on my executors to contribute five hundred dol|lars towards the erection of gallow&s;es and gibbets, for the accommodation of the &s;aid imported pa|triots, when the legi&s;lators of this unhappy &s;tate &s;hall have the wi&s;dom to countenance &s;uch u&s;eful e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> My friend J. T. Callender, the run-away from Scotland, is of cour&s;e a partaker in the la&s;t men|tioned legacy; but as a particular mark of my attention, I will and bequeath him twenty feet of pine plank, which I reque&s;t my executors to &s;ee made into a pillory, to be kept for his par|ticular u&s;e, till a gibbet can be prepared.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To Tom Paine, the author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e, Rights of Man, Age of Rea&s;on,</HI> and a <HI>letter to General Wa&s;hington,</HI> I bequeath a &s;trong hempen collar, as the only legacy I can think of that is worthy of him, as well as be&s;t adapted to render his death in &s;ome mea&s;ure as infamous as his life: and I do hereby direct and order my Executors to &s;end it to him by the fir&s;t &s;afe conveyance,
<PB N="115" REF="031947_0064_0FEF34F65C0F9030">
with my compliments, and reque&s;t that he would make u&s;e of it without delay, that the national razor may not be di&s;graced by the head of &s;uch a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To the gaunt outlandi&s;h orator, vulgarly called the Political Sinner, who in the ju&s;t order of things follows next after the la&s;t mentioned le|gatee, I bequeath the honour of partaking in his cata&s;trophe; that in their deaths, as well as in their lives, all the world may exclaim; <Q>See how rogues hang together!</Q></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To all and &s;ingular the good people of the&s;e States, I leave peace, union, abundance, hap|pine&s;s, untarni&s;hed honour, and an unconquerable everla&s;ting hatred to the French Revolutioni&s;ts and their de&s;tructive abominable principles.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> To each of my Sub&s;cribers I leave <HI>a quill,</HI> ho|ping that in their hands it may become a &s;word again&s;t every thing that is ho&s;tile to the govern|ment and independence of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">La&s;tly,</NOTE>To my three brothers, Paul, Simon and Dick, I leave my whole e&s;tate, as well real as per&s;onal (fir&s;t paying the foregoing legacies) to be equal|ly divided between them &s;hare and &s;hare alike. And I do hereby make and con&s;titute my &s;aid three brothers the Executors of this my LAST WILL; to &s;ee the &s;ame performed, according to its true intent and meaning, as far as in their power lies.</P>
