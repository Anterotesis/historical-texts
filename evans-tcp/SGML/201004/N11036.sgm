<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LIKE that fell mon&s;ter, and infernal tyrant, Charles the fir&s;t, you are determined to de|luge the land with innocent blood. Fired with rage at the more than &s;avage barbarity of your mercenary troops, your cur&s;ed in&s;truments of &s;laughter in America, I can no longer keep within the bounds of decency; the brea&s;t of every true Engli&s;hman mu&s;t be filled with indignation, and that re&s;pect which is due to a king, will be lo&s;t in a noble zeal for the pre&s;ervation of our coun|try and fellow &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Every man mu&s;t execrate a tyrant, who can without remor&s;e to &s;atiate his revenge, and gratify his lu&s;t of power de&s;troy millions of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The Americans, Sir, are fighting for liberty, the birthright of every man, they are fighting for the laws and the &s;acred con&s;titution of their country, which you are, to your eternal di&s;grace and infamy, endeavouring to de&s;troy: Their cau&s;e is a ju&s;t, it is the cau&s;e of heaven, and it never will be in your
<PB N="166" REF="013986_0002_0F9259AC05E68B38">power, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ten thou&s;and legion of tyrants be&s;ides, to fix your bloody &s;tandard of tyranny in America. England mu&s;t take a part in this bloody, this unnatural civil war, brought on through your ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude, and the treachery, corrup|tion, and villainy of your minions; unle&s;s &s;he does this, &s;he is lo&s;t forever, your unrelenting cruelty, and de&s;ire of being ab&s;olute, will never let you &s;top, and if once the Americans can be reduced to &s;lavery, we &s;hall be no longer free; you will not, you cannot re&s;t, till you have brought the whole empire into the &s;ame &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage and bond|age: But I hope for the honour and valour of my countrymen, all your infamous de&s;igns will be fru&s;|trated, and that by a noble exertion, in defence of their per&s;ecuted brethren in America, they will &s;oon convince you, how difficult, un&s;afe, and danger|ous it is to attempt to en&s;lave a brave and free peo|ple, and to e&s;tabli&s;h your throne in iniquity and blood.</P>
<P>I hope fired with the noble &s;pirit of their ance&s;|tors, they will &s;peedily carry to the throne, &s;ome|thing more than petitions or remon&s;trances; I tru&s;t they will tell you in manly terms, in terms, worthy of Britons; in terms that may &s;hake your tyrant &s;oul that they are determined to be free, that you &s;hall withdraw your troops from America; that your mini&s;ters &s;hall be delivered up to ju&s;tice, as &s;ome attonement for the blood that has been inhumanely &s;hed in England and America; that they will have all their rights confirmed to them; that they will be governed by the laws of the land, and not by the arbitrary will of you or your minions; that without the&s;e ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;itions are complied
<PB N="167" REF="013986_0003_0F9259ACDF5FF3B0">with, they are determined to appeal to heaven, and oblige you, as their forefathers have other princely tyrants to govern according to law and the &s;olemn oath you take at your coronation.</P>
<P>Engli&s;hmen, Sir, will &s;oon be rou&s;ed by the in|human &s;laughter of their brethren and fellow &s;ub|jects in America, from a &s;tate of lethargy and &s;u|pinene&s;s; it will not be long in the power of your infernal tribe of placemen and pen&s;ioners, your mi|ni&s;ters and minions, by all the arts of corruption and debauchery to keep down the glorious &s;pirit of liberty; they will not, they cannot, if there is any virtue in the nation, longer remain idle inactive &s;pectators of &s;uch cruel and bloody mea&s;ures, in which they are &s;o nearly, &s;o deeply intere&s;ted; mea|&s;ures in which mu&s;t end in the de&s;truction of li|berty and the con&s;titution, the boa&s;t and glory of this, and the envy of every other nation.</P>
<P>Your whole reign has been one continued &s;eries of tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, and inju&s;tice; the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of your mini&s;ters has been to deny right to the people, to &s;ap the con&s;titution, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h arbitrary power upon the ruins of public li|berty in every part of the Briti&s;h dominions; to feed your avarice, to gratify your ambition, and &s;atiate your revenge again&s;t individuals.</P>
<P>A king, weak, ob&s;tinate, perver&s;e, and cruel, deaf to the calls of humanity, and regardle&s;s of an oppre&s;&s;ed, injured, and loyal people, di&s;graces the dignity of human nature; and is &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any of tho&s;e attributes which characteri&s;e maje&s;ty, that he is only a mon&s;ter in human &s;hape like the devil, inve&s;ted with power, not for the pre&s;ervation, but the de&s;truction of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="013986_0004_0F9259AD832A45B0">
The breath of a tyrant bla&s;ts and poi&s;ons every thing, changes ble&s;&s;ings, and plenty into cur&s;es and mi&s;ery, great cities and flouri&s;hing kingdoms, into de&s;arts and gloomy &s;olitudes, and their rich citizens into beggars and vagabonds. I could name cities, which while they governed them&s;elves, could maintain armies, and now en&s;laved, can &s;carce maintain the poor proud ra&s;cals who govern them. It is certain, that whatever country or place is &s;ub|dued by a prince, who governs by his will, is ruined by his government.</P>
<P>You, Sir, like mo&s;t other princes, have been long introducing the Turki&s;h government into Eu|rope, and have &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that I would rather live under the Turk, than under the tyran|ny of George the third. You practi&s;e the inhuman cruelties and oppre&s;&s;ions of the Turks, and want the tolerating &s;pirit of the Turk, and if you are not &s;oon checked through the native bravery of Engli&s;hmen, the whole polity of &s;avage Turkey, will be e&s;tabli&s;hed by you in all its parts and bar|barity; as if the depopulation which is already &s;o quick, and taking &s;uch dreadful &s;trides, were &s;till too &s;low.</P>
<P>Tyrants are the common de&s;troyers of mankind; they are for ever inventing new machines of cruelty, and will, till the de&s;truction of mankind is com|pleted. They &s;eem to think they &s;hall have ene|mies as long as one man remains, who cannot be made a &s;lave. But it is a&s;toni&s;hing at fir&s;t view, that Engli&s;hmen &s;hould have &s;o long borne your tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ions, and unrelenting &s;laughter of their fellow &s;ubjects: But, alas! who knows not the force of corruption, delu&s;ion, and &s;tanding armies.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="013986_0005_0F9259AE3A8CD888">
Oh liberty! Oh &s;ervitude! how dete&s;table are the different &s;ounds! Liberty is &s;alvation in politics, as &s;lavery is reprobation; neither is there any other di&s;tinction but that of &s;aint and devil, between the chamption of the one and of the other.</P>
<P>No one can &s;ufficiently &s;hew the glorious advan|tages of liberty, nor &s;et off the dreadful mi&s;chie&s;s of raging, relentle&s;s, con&s;uming tyranny.&mdash;A ta&s;k to which no human mind is equal; for neither the &s;ublime&s;t wits of antiquity, nor the brighte&s;t geni|us's of late or modern times, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the powers of rhetoric, and all the &s;timulations of po|etic fire, with the warme&s;t and bolde&s;t figures in language, ever did, ever could, or ever can, de|&s;cribe and heighten &s;ufficiently, the beauty of the one, or the deformity of the other:, Language fails in it, and words are too weak.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who do not groan under the yoke of heavy and pointed va&s;&s;alage, cannot po&s;&s;ibly have images equal to a calamity which they do not feel; and tho&s;e which feel it, are &s;tupified by it, and their minds depre&s;&s;ed; nor can they have conceptions large, bright, and comprehen&s;ive enough, to be fully &s;en&s;ible of their own wretched condition; much le&s;s can they paint it in proper colour to others. The people of England, Sir, who enjoy the pre|cious, lovely, and invaluable ble&s;&s;ing of liberty, know that nothing can be paid too dear to purcha&s;e and pre&s;erve it. Without it the world is a wilder|ne&s;s, and life is a mi&s;erable burthen: Death is a tri|bute we all owe to nature, and mu&s;t pay; and it is infinitely preferable, in any &s;hape to an ignominious life: Nor can we re&s;tore our being back again into the hands of our great creator, with more glory to
<PB N="170" REF="013986_0006_0F9259AF16BEAD78">him, more honour to our&s;elves, or more advantage to mankind, than in defence of all that is valuable, religious, and prai&s;e worthy upon earth.</P>
<P>How execrable then, and infamous are the wretches, who for a few precarious momentary, and perhaps imaginary advantages, would rob their country for ever of every thing that can render life de&s;irable; and for a little tin&s;el pageantry and &s;ur|vile homage, unworthy of hone&s;t men, and hated by wi&s;e men, would involve millions of their fellow creatures in la&s;ting mi&s;ery, bondage, and woe; &s;uch unnatural royal parricides, unworthy of the human &s;hape and name, would fill up the mea&s;ure of their barbarity by entailing, poverty, chains, and &s;orrow upon their own po&s;terity: And, Sir, you ought to remember &s;uch tyrants have unpitied, &s;uffered in their own per&s;ons, the &s;ad effects of tho&s;e cruel councils and &s;chemes, which they intended for the ruin of all but them&s;elves and their minions; and ju&s;tly fallen into that pit they had traiterou&s;ly digged for others.</P>
