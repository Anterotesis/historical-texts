<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING had a tran&s;ient view of the follow|ing Poetic Compo&s;itions, compo&s;ed by the Author at about twenty years of age, they appear to me to di&s;|play the traits of a genius propitiou&s;ly fo&s;tered by the Mu&s;es; and give a &s;pecimen of what might be expected from the &s;ame Author, having arrived to riper years, under the cultivation of experience and reading, and e&s;pecially the influence of a more &s;erious and heavenly turn of mind; which tends not only to elevate and clarify the Parna&s;&s;ian Font, but to give its &s;treams a more happy direction:&mdash;I can, therefore, recommend them to the public peru&s;al.</P>

<L>SAY, weeping Mu&s;e, what means that pa&s;&s;ing bell!</L>
<L>What breathle&s;s cor&s;e demands that &s;olemn knell!</L>
<L>What &s;oul, departed, moves in &s;ad parade</L>
<L>To Death's cold man&s;ions, and the gloomy &s;hade?</L>
<L>But, ah! methinks the fatal news is &s;pread,</L>
<L>And fame proclaims, that <HI>Ogilvie</HI> is dead.</L>
<L>The pious <HI>Ogilvie!</HI> is he no more!</L>
<L>Then Zion mourn, thy heavy lo&s;s deplore;</L>
<L>In &s;olemn grief command thy tears to flow,</L>
<L>And bid each bo&s;om &s;well with anxious woe:</L>
<L>Let all thy courts in &s;able robes be hung,</L>
<L>And fun'ral dirges &s;ound from ev'ry tongue:</L>
<L>Thy faithful Pa&s;tor, from thy bo&s;om torn,</L>
<L>His charge to keep, &s;hall never more return.</L>
<L>(Yet, could our grief, or floods of tears, oh Death!</L>
<L>Re&s;tore him &s;pirit, and his vital breath;</L>
<L>That frame inanimate, again &s;hould live,</L>
<L>And thou thy victim to exi&s;tence give:</L>
<L>But vain is grief, when life's extinct and fled;</L>
<L>The &s;luggi&s;h ma&s;s returns not from the dead;</L>
<L>Nor &s;orrow, tears, or mourning, can retrieve</L>
<L>The clay-cold victim from the op'ning grave.)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Speak ye, his Fav'rite, once peculiar care,</L>
<L>How va&s;t his worth, how great his virtues were:</L>
<L>Say, with what grace his heav'nly accents flow'd&mdash;</L>
<L>How much he lov'd, how much rever'd his God:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="021882_0004_0FB5ED4709EEADC8">What &s;trong conviction, to his precepts join'd,</L>
<L>Alarm'd each thoughtle&s;s, unbelieving mind:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t harden'd &s;inners trembled as they &s;ate,</L>
<L>Struck with the horrors of their dang'rous &s;tate,</L>
<L>Their pa&s;t offences in contrition mourn'd,</L>
<L>And, &s;orrowing, &s;ought the God they once had &s;corn'd.</L>
<L>This, happy Saint, was here thy great employ&mdash;</L>
<L>To &s;erve thy God, thy &s;ole, thy only joy:</L>
<L>But time, and &s;en&s;e, are now with thee no more;</L>
<L>Pa&s;t are thy labours, and thy cares are o'er:</L>
<L>Thy &s;oul, enlarg'd, mounts the cele&s;tial road,</L>
<L>And Seraphs &s;afe conduct thee to thy God;</L>
<L>Myriads of Angels thy arrival wait,</L>
<L>And hail thy ent'rance in Jeru&s;'lem's gate;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Heav'ns high arch with &s;houts of triumph rings,</L>
<L>And loud Ho&s;annas to the King of kings:</L>
<L>There, full fruition is thy ju&s;t reward,</L>
<L>And thou art happy in thy Saviour Lord;</L>
<L>With Saints made perfect, thou thy &s;ong &s;hall rai&s;e,</L>
