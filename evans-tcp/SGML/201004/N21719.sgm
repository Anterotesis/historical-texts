<HEAD>TO DAVID GARDINER, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> <HI>Cornet in</HI> Sir John Cope's <HI>Regiment of Dragoons.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE my heart is following you with a truly pater|nal &s;olicitude, through all the dangers of military life, in which you are thus early engaged, anxious for your &s;afety amid&s;t the in&s;truments of death, and the far more dangerous allurements of vice; I feel a peculiar plea&s;ure in being able at length, though after &s;uch long delays, to put into your hands the MEMOIRS with which I now pre&s;ent you. They contain many particulars, which would have been worthy of your attentive notice, had they related to a per&s;on of the mo&s;t di&s;tant nation or age: But they will, I doubt not, command your peculiar regard, as they are &s;acred to the memory of that excellent man, from whom you had the honour to derive your birth, and by who&s;e generous and affectionate care, you have been laid under all the obliga|tions, which the be&s;t of fathers could confer on a mo&s;t be|loved &s;on.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, you &s;ee a gentleman, who with all the advan|tages of a liberal and religious education, added to every na|tural accompli&s;hment that could render him mo&s;t agreeable, entered, before he had attained the &s;tature of a man, on tho&s;e arduous and generous &s;ervices to which you are devoted, and behaved in them with a gallantry and courage, which will always give a &s;plendor to his name among the Briti&s;h &s;oldiery, and render him an example to all officers of his rank. But alas! amid&s;t all the intrepidity of the Martial Hero, you &s;ee him vanqui&s;hed by the blandi&s;hments of plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="4" REF="028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80">
and in chace of it plunging him&s;elf into follies and vices, for which no want of education or genius could have been a &s;ufficient excu&s;e. You behold him urging the ignoble and fatal pur&s;uit, unmoved by the terrors which death was con|tinually darting around him, and the mo&s;t &s;ignal deliverances by which Providence again and again re&s;cued him from tho&s;e terrors; till at length he was reclaimed by an ever|memorable interpo&s;ition of divine grace. Then you have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him become in good earne&s;t a convert to Chri&s;tianity, and by &s;peedy advances growing up into one of its brighte&s;t ornaments; his mind continually filled with the great ideas which the go&s;pel of our Redeemer &s;ugge&s;ts, and bringing the ble&s;&s;ed influence of its &s;ublime principles into every relation of military and civil, of public and do|me&s;tic life. You trace him per&s;evering in a &s;teady and uniform cour&s;e of goodne&s;s, through a long &s;eries of honour|able and pro&s;perous years, the delight of all that were &s;o happy as to know him, and, in his &s;phere, the mo&s;t faithful guardian of his country; till at la&s;t, worn out with honour|able labours, and broken with infirmities which they had ha&s;tened upon him before the time, you &s;ee him forgetting them at once at the call of duty and Providence; with all the generous ardour of his mo&s;t vigorous days ru&s;hing on the enemies of religion and liberty, &s;u&s;taining their &s;hock with the mo&s;t deliberate fortitude, when de&s;erted by tho&s;e that &s;hould have &s;upported him, and chearfully &s;acrificing the lit|tle remains of a mortal life, in the triumphant views of a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the noble object I pre&s;ent to your view; and you will, I hope, fix your eye continually upon it, and will never allow your&s;elf for one day to forget, that this illu&s;tri|ous man is COLONEL GARDINER, your ever honoured fa|ther; who having approved his <HI>fidelity to the death</HI> and re|ceived <HI>a crown of life,</HI> &s;eems as it were, by what you here read, to be calling out to you from amid&s;t <HI>the cloud of wit|ne&s;&s;es</HI> with which you are &s;urrounded, and urging you by every generous, tender, filial &s;entiment, to mark the foot|&s;teps of his Chri&s;tian race, and &s;trenuou&s;ly to maintain that combat, where the victory is through divine grace certain, and the prize an eternal kingdom in the heavens.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028578_0003_0FD972BDD01B4A80">My hopes, Sir, that all the&s;e powerful motives will e&s;pe|cially have their full efficacy on you, are greatly encouraged by the certainty which I have of your being well acquainted with the evidence of Chri&s;tianity in its full extent; a cri|minal ignorance of which, in the mid&s;t of great advantages for learning them, leaves &s;o many of our young people a prey to Dei&s;m, and &s;o to vice and ruin, which generally bring up its rear. My life would be a continual burthen to me, if I had not a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of God, that during the years in which the important tru&s;t of your education was committed to my care, I had laid before you the proofs both of natural and revealed religion, in what I a&s;&s;uredly e&s;teem to be, with regard to the judgment, if they are carefully ex|amined, an irre&s;i&s;table light; and that I had endeavoured to attend them with tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, which might be mo&s;t likely to impre&s;s your heart. You have not, dear Sir, forgotten, and I am confident you can never entirely forget, the a&s;&s;i|duity with which I have laboured to form your mind, not only to what might be ornamental to you in human life, but above all to a true ta&s;te of what is really excellent, and an early contempt of tho&s;e vanities by which the generality of our youth, e&s;pecially in your &s;tation, are deba&s;ed, enerva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and undone. My private as well as public addre&s;&s;es for this purpo&s;e will, I know, be remembered by you, and the tears of tenderne&s;s with which they have &s;o often been ac|companied: And may they be &s;o remembered, that they who are mo&s;t tenderly concerned, may be comforted under the lo&s;s of &s;uch an ine&s;timable friend as Colonel Gardiner, by &s;eeing that his character, in all its mo&s;t amiable and re|&s;plendent parts, lives in you; and that how difficult &s;oever it may be to act up to that height of expectation, with which the eyes of the world will be fixed on the &s;on of &s;uch a fa|ther, you are, in the &s;trength of divine grace attempting it; at lea&s;t are following him with generous emulation, and with daily &s;olicitude, that the &s;teps may be le&s;s unequal!</P>
<P>May the Lord God of your father, and I will add, of both your pious and honourable parents, animate your heart more and more with &s;uch views and &s;entiments as the&s;e! May he guard your life amid&s;t every &s;cene of danger, to be

a protection and ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e that are yet unborn; and may He give you, in &s;ome far di&s;tant period of time, to re|&s;ign it by a gentler di&s;&s;olution than the hero from whom you &s;prung; or if unerring wi&s;dom appoint otherwi&s;e, to end it with equal glory.</P>

<HEAD>SOME <HI>REMARKABLE PASSAGES</HI> IN THE LIFE OF THE HONOURABLE COL. JAMES GARDINER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">&sect; 1. WHEN I promi&s;ed the public &s;ome larger account of the life and character of this illu&s;trious per&s;on, than I could conveniently in&s;ert in my &s;ermon on the &s;ad occa&s;ion of his death, I was &s;ecure, that, if providence continued my capacity of writing, I &s;hould not wholly di&s;appoint the expectation. For I was furni&s;hed with a variety of parti|culars, which appeared to me worthy of general notice, in con&s;equence of that intimate friend&s;hip with which he had honoured me during the &s;ix la&s;t years of his life; a friend|&s;hip which led him to open his heart to me in repeated con|ver&s;ations with an unbounded confidence, (as he then a&s;&s;ur|ed me, beyond what he had u&s;ed with any other man liv|ing,) &s;o far as religious experiences were concerned: And I had al&s;o received &s;everal very valuable letters from him, during the time of our ab&s;ence from each other, which con|tained mo&s;t genuine and edifying traces of his chri&s;tian cha|racter. But I hoped farther to learn many valuable particulars from the papers of his own clo&s;et; and from his letters to other friends, as well as from what they more circum&s;tan|tially knew concerning him: I therefore determined to de|lay the execution of my promi&s;e, till I could enjoy the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="028578_0005_0FD972C4CD7DA0E8">
advantages for performing it in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory man|ner; nor have I, on the whole, rea&s;on to regret that deter|mination.</P>
<P N="2">&sect;. 2. I &s;hall not trouble my reader with all the cau&s;es, which concurred to retard the&s;e expected a&s;&s;i&s;tances for al|mo&s;t a whole year: The chief of them were, the tedious langui&s;hing illne&s;s of his afflicted lady, through who&s;e hands it was proper the papers &s;hould pa&s;s; together with the con|fu&s;ion into which the rebels had thrown them, when they ran&s;acked his &s;eat at Bankton, where mo&s;t of them were depo&s;ited. But having now received &s;uch of them, as have e&s;caped their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">acious hands, and could conveniently be collected and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an&s;mitted I &s;et my&s;elf with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">form, what I e&s;teem, not merely a tribute of gratitude to the memory of my invaluable friend, (though never was the memory of any mortal man more precious and &s;acred to me;) but of duty to God, and my fellow-creatures: For I have a mo&s;t chearful hope, that the nar|rative I am now to write will, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, be a means of &s;preading, what of all things in the world every benevolent heart will mo&s;t de&s;ire to &s;pread, a warm and lively &s;en&s;e of religion.</P>
<P N="3">&sect;. 3. My own heart has been &s;o much edified and ani|mated, by what I have read in the memoirs of per&s;ons who have been eminent for wi&s;dom and piety, that I cannot but wi&s;h the trea&s;ure may be more and more increa&s;ed: And I would hope, the world may gather the like valuable fruits from the life I am now attempting; not only as it will con|tain very &s;ingular circum&s;tances, which may excite a general curio&s;ity, but as it comes attended with &s;ome other particu|lar advantages.</P>
<P N="4">&sect;. 4. The reader is here to &s;urvey a character of &s;uch eminent and various goodne&s;s, as might demand veneration, and in&s;pire him with a de&s;ire to imitate it too, had it appear|ed in the ob&s;cure&s;t rank: But it will &s;urely command &s;ome peculiar regard when viewed in &s;o elevated and important a &s;tation; e&s;pecially as it &s;hone, not in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but mi|litary life, where the temptations are &s;o many, and the pre|valency of the contrary character &s;o great, that it may &s;eem no incon&s;iderable prai&s;e and felicity to be free from di&s;&s;olute vice, and to retain what in mo&s;t other profe&s;&s;ions might be e&s;teemed only a mediocrity of virtue. It may &s;urely with
<PB N="9" REF="028578_0005_0FD972C4CD7DA0E8">
the highe&s;t ju&s;tice be expected, that the title and bravery of Colonel Gardiner will invite many of our officers and &s;ol|diers, to whom his name has long been honourable and dear, to peru&s;e this account of him with &s;ome peculiar attention: In con&s;equence of which, it may be a means of increa&s;ing the number, and brightening the character, of tho&s;e who are already adorning their office, their country, and their religion; and of reclaiming tho&s;e, who will &s;ee rather what they ought to be, than what they are. On the whole, to the <HI>gentlemen of the &s;word</HI> I would particularly offer the&s;e memoirs, as theirs by &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a title: Yet I am firm|ly per&s;uaded, there are none, who&s;e office is &s;o &s;acred, or who&s;e proficiency in the religious life is &s;o advanced, but they may find &s;omething to demand their thankfulne&s;s, and to awaken their emulation.</P>
<P N="5">&sect;. 5. Colonel James Gardiner, of whom we write, was the &s;on of Captain Patrick Gardiner, of the family of Tor|wood-Head, by Mrs. Mary H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dge, of the family of Glad&s;|muir. The Captain who was ma&s;ter of a hand&s;ome e&s;tate, &s;erved many years in the army of King William and Queen Anne, and died abroad with the Briti&s;h forces in Germa|ny, quickly after the battle of Hoch&s;ter, through the fa|tigues he underwent in the duties of that celebrated cam|paign. He had a company in the regiment of foot, once commanded by Colonel Hodge, his valiant brother-in-law, who was &s;lain at the head of that regiment, (my memorial from Scotland &s;ays,) at the battle of Steenkirk, which was fought in the year 1692.</P>
<P N="6">&sect; 6. Mrs. Gardner, our Colonel's mother, was a lady of a very valuable character; but it plea&s;ed God to exerci&s;e her with very uncommon trials: For &s;he not only lo&s;t her hu&s;band and her brother in the &s;ervice of their country, as before related, but al&s;o her elde&s;t &s;on, Mr. Robert Gardi|ner, on the day which compleated the 16th year of his age, at the &s;iege of Namur, in 1695. But there is great rea&s;on to believe, God ble&s;&s;ed the&s;e various and heavy afflictions as the means of forming her to that eminent degree of piety, which will render her memory honourable as long as it con|tinues.</P>
<P N="7">&sect;. 7. Her &s;econd &s;on, the worthy per&s;on of whom I am now to give a more particular account, was born at Carri|den, in Linlithgow-&s;hire, on the 10th of January, A. D.
<PB N="10" REF="028578_0006_0FD972C611F3EE98">
1687-8; the memorable year of that glorious revolution which he ju&s;tly e&s;teemed among the happie&s;t of all events. So that when he was &s;lain in the defence of tho&s;e liberties, which God then by &s;o gracious a providence re&s;cued from utter de&s;truction, <HI>i. e.</HI> on the 21&s;t of September, 1745, he was aged 57 years, 8 months, and 11 days.</P>
<P N="8">&sect;. 8. The annual return of his birth day was ob&s;erved by him, in the latter and better years of his life, in a man|ner very different from what is commonly practi&s;ed: For in&s;tead of making it a day of fe&s;tivity, I am told, he rather di&s;tingui&s;hed it as a &s;ea&s;on of more than ordinary humilia|tion before God; both in commemoration of tho&s;e mercies which he received in the fir&s;t opening of life, and under an affectionate &s;en&s;e, as well of his long alienation from the great author and &s;upport of his being, as of the many imperfections which he lamented, in the be&s;t of his days and &s;ervices.</P>
<P N="9">&sect;. 9. I have not met with many things remarkable con|cerning the early years of his life, only that his mother took care to in&s;truct him with great tenderne&s;s and affection, in the principles of true chri&s;tianity. He was al&s;o trained up in human literature at the &s;chool at Linlithgow, where he made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the languages. I re|member to have heard him quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the Latin Cla&s;&s;icks very pertinently; though his employment in life, and the various turns which his mind took under different impul&s;es in &s;ucceeding years, prevented him from cultivat|ing &s;uch &s;tudies.</P>
<P N="10">&sect;. 10. The good effects of his mother's prudent and ex|emplary care were not &s;o con&s;picuous, as &s;he wi&s;hed and hoped, in the younger part of her &s;on's life; yet there is great rea&s;on to believe, they were not entirely lo&s;t. As they were probably the occa&s;ion of many convictions, which in his younger years were over-borne; &s;o I doubt not, that when religious impre&s;&s;ions took that &s;trong hold of his heart which they afterwards did, that &s;tock of knowledge which had been &s;o early laid up in his mind, was found of con&s;i|derable &s;ervice And I have heard him make the ob&s;erva|tion, as an encouragement to parents, and other pious friends, to do their duty, and to hope for tho&s;e good con&s;equences of it which may not immediately appear.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="11" REF="028578_0006_0FD972C611F3EE98">&sect;. 11. Could his mother, or a very religious aunt, (of who&s;e good in&s;tructions and exhortations I have often heard him &s;peak with plea&s;ure,) have prevailed, he would not have thought of a military life, from which, it is no won|der, the&s;e ladies endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him, con&s;idering the mournful experience they had of the dangers attending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the dear relatives they had lo&s;t already by it. But it &s;uited his ta&s;te; and the ardor of his &s;pirit, animated by the per&s;ua&s;ions of a friend who greatly urged it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e this to have been Brigadier General Rue, who had from his childhood a peculiar affection for him.</NOTE> was not to be re&s;trained. Nor will the reader wonder, that thus excited and &s;upported, it ea&s;ily overbore their tender remon&s;trances, when he knows, that this lively youth fought three duels be|fore he attained to the &s;tature of a man; in one of which, when he was but eight years old, he received from a boy much older than him&s;elf, a wound in his right cheek, the &s;car of which was always very apparent. The fal&s;e &s;en&s;e of honour which in&s;tigated him to it, might &s;eem indeed &s;omething excu&s;eable, in tho&s;e unripened years, and con&s;i|dering the profe&s;&s;ion of his father, brother, and uncle; but I have often heard him mention this ra&s;hne&s;s with that regret, which the reflection would naturally give to &s;o wi&s;e and good a man in the maturity of life. And I have been informed, that after his remarkable conver&s;ion, he declined accepting a challenge, with this calm and truly great reply which in a man of his experienced bravery was exceeding graceful; "I fear &s;inning, though you know I do not fear fighting."</P>
<P N="12">&sect;. 12. He &s;erved fir&s;t as a cadet which mu&s;t have been very early; and then at 14 years old, he bore an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in a Scotch regiment in the Dutch &s;ervice; in which he continued till the year 1702, when (if my infor|mation be right,) he received an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion from Queen Anne, which he bore in the battle of Ramellies, be|ing then in the 19th year of his age. In this ever memora|ble action, he received a wound in his mouth by a mu&s;ket-ball, which hath often been reported to be the occa&s;ion of his conver&s;ion. That report was a mi&s;taken one; but as &s;ome very remarkable circum&s;tances attended this affair, which I have had the plea&s;ure of hearing more than once from his own mouth, I hope my reader will excu&s;e me, if I give him &s;o uncommon a &s;tory at large.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="12" REF="028578_0007_0FD972CBA53BF3B0">&sect;. 13. Our young officer was of a party in the forlorn hope, and was commanded on what &s;eemed almo&s;t a de&s;pe|rate &s;ervice, to di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;e&s;s the French of the church-yard at Ramellies, where a con&s;iderable number of them were po&s;t|ed to remarkable advantage. They &s;ucceeded much better than was expected; and it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Gardiner, who had before been in &s;everal encounters, and had the view of making his fortune to animate the natural intrepidity of his &s;pirit, was glad of &s;uch an opportunity of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf, accordingly he had planted his colours on an advanced ground; and while he was calling to his men, (probably in that horrid language, which is &s;o pecu|liar a di&s;grace to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r &s;oldiery, and &s;o ab&s;urdly common in &s;uch articles of extreme danger,) he received a &s;hot into his mouth; which, without beating out any of his teeth, or touching the fore-part of his tongue, went through his neck, and came out about an inch and an half on the left-&s;ide of the vertebrae. Not feeling at fir&s;t the pain of the &s;troke, he wondered what was become of the ball, and in the wilder|ne&s;s of his &s;urprize began to &s;u&s;pect he had &s;wallowed it; but dropping &s;oon after, he traced the pa&s;&s;age of it by his finger, when he could di&s;cover it no other way: which I men|tion as one circum&s;tance, among many which occur to make it probable that the greater part of tho&s;e who fall in battle by the&s;e in&s;truments of death, feel very little angui&s;h from the mo&s;t mortal wounds.</P>
<P N="14">&sect;. 14. This accident happened about five or &s;ix in the e|vening, on the 23d day of May, in the year 1706; and the army pur&s;uing its advantages again&s;t the French, without ever regarding the wounded (which was it &s;eems the Duke of Marlborough's con&s;tant method) our young officer lay all night in the field; agitated as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, with a great variety of thoughts. He a&s;&s;ured me, that when he reflected upon the circum&s;tances of his wound, that a ball &s;hould, as he then conceived it, go through his head without killing him, he thought God had pre&s;erved him by miracle; and therefore a&s;&s;uredly concluded, that he &s;hould live, abandoned and de&s;perate as his &s;tate then &s;eemed to be. Yet, (which to me appeared very a&s;toni&s;hing) he had little thoughts of humbling him&s;elf before God, and returning to him after the wanderings of a life &s;o licentiou&s;ly begun.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028578_0007_0FD972CBA53BF3B0">But expecting to recover, his mind was taken up with contrivances to &s;ecure his gold, of which he had a pretty deal about him; and he had recour&s;e in a very odd expedi|ent, which proved &s;ucce&s;sful. Expecting to be &s;tripped, he fir&s;t took out a handful of that clotted gore, of which he was frequently obliged to clear his mouth, or he would have been choaked; and putting it into his left-hand, he took out his money (which I think, was about nineteen pi&s;toles) and &s;hutting his hand, and be&s;mearing the back part of it with blood, he kept it in this po&s;ition till the blood dried in &s;uch a manner, that his hand could not ea&s;ily fall open, though any &s;udden &s;urprize &s;hould happen, in which he might lo&s;e the pre&s;ence of mind which that concealment otherwi&s;e would have required.</P>
<P N="15">&sect; 15 In the morning the French, who were ma&s;ters of the &s;pot, though their forces were defeated at &s;ome di&s;|tance came to plunder the &s;lain; and &s;eeing him to appear|ance almo&s;t expiring, one of them was ju&s;t applying a &s;word to his brea&s;t, to de&s;troy the little remainder of life; when in the critical moment, upon which all the extraordinary events of &s;uch a life as his afterwards proved were &s;u&s;pended, a cordelier, who attended the plunderers, interpo&s;ed, taking him by his dre&s;s for a Frenchman; and &s;aid, "Do not kill that poor child." Our young &s;oldier heard all that pa&s;&s;ed, though he was not able to &s;peak one word; and opening his eyes, made a &s;ign for &s;omething to drink. They gave him a &s;up of &s;ome &s;pirituous liquor, which happened to be at hand; by which he &s;aid he found a more &s;en&s;ible refre&s;hment, than he could remember from any thing he had ta&s;ted either before or &s;ince. Then &s;igning to the friar to lean down his ear to his mouth, he employed the fir&s;t efforts of his feeble breath in telling him (what, alas was a contrived fal&s;e|hood) that he was nephew to the governor of Huy, a neutral town in the neighbourhood, and that, if he could take any method of conveying him thither, he did not doubt but his uncle would liberally reward him. He had indeed a friend at Huy, (who I think, was governor, and if I mi&s;take not, had been acquainted with the captain his father) from whom he expected a kind reception: but the relation was only pre|tended. On hearing this, they laid him on a &s;ort of hand-barrow, and &s;ent him by a file of mu&s;quet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs towards the

The poor patient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">nd being &s;till undre&s;&s;ed, it is not to be wondered that by this time it raged violently.</P>
<P>The angui&s;h of it engaged him earne&s;tly to beg that they would either kill him outright, or leave him there to die, without the torture of any farther motion; and indeed they were obliged to re&s;t for a con&s;iderable time, on account of their own wearine&s;s. Thus he &s;pent the &s;econd night in the open air, without any thing more than a common ban|dage to &s;tanch the blood. He hath often mentioned it as a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing providence, that he did not bleed to death; which, under God, he a&s;cribed to the remarkable coldne&s;s of the&s;e two nights.</P>

Judging it quite un&s;afe to attempt carrying him to Huy, from whence they were now &s;everal miles di&s;tant, his convoy took him early in the morning to a convent in the neighbourhood; where he was ho&s;pitably received, and treat|ed with great kindne&s;s and tenderne&s;s. But the cure of his wound was committed to an ignorant barber &s;urgeon, who lived near the hou&s;e: the be&s;t &s;hift that could then be made, at a time when it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;ons of ability in their profe&s;&s;ion had their hands full of employment. The tent which this arti&s;t applied, was almo&s;t like a peg driven into the wound; and gentlemen of &s;kill and experience, when they came to hear of the manner in which he was treat|ed, wondered how he could po&s;&s;ibly &s;urvive &s;uch management. But by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the&s;e applications, rough as they were, he recovered in a few months. The lady ab|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, who called him her &s;on, treated him with the affection and care of a mother; and he always declared, that every thing which he &s;aw within the&s;e walls, was conducted with the &s;tricte&s;t decency and decorum. He received a great many devout admonitions from the ladies there; and they would fain have per&s;uaded him to acknow|ledge what they thought &s;o miraculous a deliverance, by em|bracing the catholic faith, as they were plea&s;ed to call it. But they could not &s;ucceed: for though no religion lay near his heart, yet he had too much of the &s;pirit of a gentleman, lightly to change that form of religion, which he wore (as it were) loo&s;e about him; as well as too much good &s;en&s;e, to &s;wallow tho&s;e mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities of popery, which im|mediately

When his liberty was regained by an exchange of pri&s;oners, and his health thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, he was far from rendering unto the Lord according to that wonder|ful di&s;play of divine mercy which he had experienced. I know very little of the particulars of tho&s;e wild, thoughtle&s;s, and wretched years, which lay between the 19th and the 30th of his life; except it be, that he frequently experienced the divine goodne&s;s in renewed in&s;tances, particularly in pre|&s;erving him in &s;everal hot military actions in all which he ne|ver received &s;o much as a wound after this, forward as he was in tempting danger; and yet, that all the&s;e years were &s;pent in an entire alienation from God, and an eager pur&s;uit of a|nimal plea&s;ure, as his &s;upreme good. The &s;eries of crimi|nal amours in which he was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly engaged du|ring this time, mu&s;t probably have afforded &s;ome remarka|ble adventures and occurrences; but the memory of them is peri&s;hed. Nor do I think it unworthy notice here, that a|mid&s;t all the intimacy of our friend&s;hip, and the many hours of chearful, as well as &s;erious conver&s;e, which we &s;pent toge|ther, I never remember to have heard him &s;peak of any of the&s;e intrigues, otherwi&s;e than in the general with deep and &s;o|lemn abhorrence This I the rather mention, as it &s;eemed a mo&s;t genuine proof of his unfeigned repentance; which, I think, there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, when people &s;eem to take a plea&s;ure in relating and de&s;cribing &s;cenes of vicious in|dulgence, which yet they profe&s;s to have di&s;approved and for&s;aken.</P>

Amid&s;t all the&s;e pernicious wanderings from the paths of religion, virtue, and happine&s;s, he approved him|&s;elf &s;o well in his military character, that he was made a lieutenant in that year, viz. 1706: And I am told, he was very quickly after promoted to a cornet's commi&s;&s;ion in lord Stair's regiment of the Scotch greys; and on the 31&s;t of January, in the year 1714-15, was made captain li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute|nant in Colonel Ker's regiment of dragoons. He had the honour of being known to the Earl of Stair &s;ome time be|fore, and was made his aid de-camp; and when, upon his lord&s;hip's being appointed amba&s;&s;ador from his late maje&s;ty to the court of France, he made &s;o &s;plendid an entrance in|to Paris, Captain Gardiner was his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e;

and I have been told, that a great deal of the care of that admirably well adju&s;ted ceremony fell upon him; &s;o that he gained great credit by the manner in which he conduct|ed it. Under the benign influences of his lord&s;hip's favour, (which to the la&s;t day of his life he retained,) a captain's commi&s;&s;ion was procured for him, (dated July 22, in the year 1715,) in the regiment of dragoons commanded by Colonel Stanhope, (now Earl of Harrington;) and, in the year 1717, he was advanced to the majority of that regi|ment; in which office he continued till it was reduced, on November the 10th, 1718; when he was put out of com|mi&s;&s;ion. But then his maje&s;ty King George I. was &s;o tho|roughly apprized of his faithful and important &s;ervices, that he gave him his &s;ign-manual, intituling him to the fir&s;t majority that &s;hould become vacant, in any regiment of hor&s;e or dragoons; which happened, about five years after, to be in Croft's regiment of dragoons, in which he receiv|ed a commi&s;&s;ion, dated June the 1&s;t, 1724; and on the 20th of July the &s;ame year, he was made major of an older re|giment, commanded by the Earl of Stair.</P>

As I am now &s;peaking of &s;o many of his military preferments, I will di&s;patch the account of them by ob&s;erv|ing, that on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th of January, 1729-30, he was advan|ced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the &s;ame regiment, long under the command of Lord Cadogan; with who&s;e friend&s;hip this brave and vigilant officer was al&s;o honoured for many years. And he continued in this rank, and re|giment, till the 19th of April, 1743, when he received a colonel's commi&s;&s;ion over a regiment of dragoons, lately commanded by Brigadier Bland; at the head of which he valiantly &s;ell, in the defence of his &s;overeign and his coun|try, about two years and an half after he received it.</P>
<P N="20">&sect;. 20 We will now return to that period of his life which pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, the &s;cene of &s;uch remarkable and important events. He continued (if I remember right,) &s;everal years under the roof of the brave and generous Earl of Stair; to whom he endeavoured to approve him&s;elf by every in&s;tance of diligent and faithful &s;ervice. And his lord&s;hip gave no incon&s;iderable proof of the dependance which he had upon him, when, in the beginning of the year 1715, he intru&s;t|ed him with the important di&s;patches, relating to a di&s;cove|ry, which by a &s;eries of admirable policy he had made, of
<PB N="17" REF="028578_0009_0FD972D2E1ACD1B0">
a de&s;ign which the French king was then forming, for in|vading Great-Britain in favour of the pretender; in which the French apprehended they were &s;o &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, that it &s;eemed a point of friend&s;hip in one of the chief coun&s;ellors of that court, to di&s;&s;uade a dependant of his from accepting &s;ome employment under his Britannic maje&s;ty, when pro|po&s;ed by his envoy there; becau&s;e it was &s;aid, that in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks there would be a revolution, in favour of what they called the family of the Stuarts. The captain di&s;patched his journey with the utmo&s;t &s;peed; a variety of circum&s;tances happily concurred to accelerate it; and they, who remember how &s;oon the regiments which that emergen|cy required were rai&s;ed and armed, will, I doubt not, e&s;teem it a memorable in&s;tance, both of the mo&s;t cordial zeal in the friends of the government, and of the gracious care of divine providence over the hou&s;e of Hanover, and the Bri|ti&s;h liberties, &s;o in&s;eparably connected with its intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="21">&sect;. 21. While Captain Gardiner was at London, in one of the journies he made upon this occa&s;ion, he, with that frankne&s;s which was natural to him, and which in tho&s;e days was not always under the mo&s;t prudent re&s;traint, ventured to predict, from what he knew of the bad &s;tate of the French king's health, that he would not live &s;ix weeks. This was made known by &s;ome &s;pies who were at St. James's, and came to be reported at the court of Ver&s;ailles; for he re|ceived letters from &s;ome friends at Paris, advi&s;ing him not to return thither, unle&s;s he could reconcile him&s;elf to a lodging in the ba&s;tile. But he was &s;oon free from that ap|prehen&s;ion; for, if I mi&s;take not, before half that time was accompli&s;hed, Louis XIV. died, Sept. 1, 1715, and it is generally thought, his death was ha&s;tened by a very acci|dental circum&s;tance, which had &s;ome reference to the cap|tain's prophecy. For the la&s;t time he ever dined in public, which was a very little while after the report of it had been made there, he happened to di&s;cover our Briti&s;h envoy a|mong the &s;pectators. The penetration of this illu&s;trious per&s;on was too great, and his attachment to the intere&s;t of his royal ma&s;ter too well known, not to render him very di&s;agreeable to that crafty and tyrannical prince, whom God had &s;o long &s;uffered to be the di&s;grace of monarchy, and the &s;courge of Europe. He at fir&s;t appeared very languid, as
<PB N="18" REF="028578_0010_0FD972DBD1383018">
indeed he was; but on ca&s;ting his eye upon the Earl of Stair, he affected to appear before him in a much better &s;tate of health than he really was; and therefore, as if he had been awakened on a &s;udden from &s;ome deep reverie, he im|mediately put him&s;elf into an erect po&s;ture, called up a la|boured vivacity into his countenance, and eat much more heartily than was by any means advi&s;eable, repeating it two or three times to a nobleman, (I think the Duke of Bour|bon,) then in waiting, <Q>Methinks I eat very well, for a man who is to die &s;o &s;oon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il me &s;emble, que je ne mange pas mal pour un homme qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> devoit mourir &s;i t&oacute;t</NOTE>.</Q> But this inroad upon that regularity of living, which he had for &s;ome time ob&s;erved, agreed &s;o ill with him, that he never recovered this meal, but died in le&s;s than a fortnight. This gave occa&s;ion for &s;ome humorous people to &s;ay, that old Louis after all, was killed by a Briton. But if this &s;tory be true, (which I think there can be no room to doubt, as the colonel, from whom I have often heard it, though ab&s;ent, could &s;carce be mi&s;informed,) it might more properly be &s;aid, that he fell by his own vanity; in which view I thought it &s;o remarka|ble, as not to be unworthy a place in the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P N="22">&sect;. 22. The captain quickly returned, and continued with &s;mall interruptions at Paris, at lea&s;t till the year 1720, and how much longer I do not certainly know. The Earl's fa|vor and genero&s;ity made him ea&s;y in his affairs though he was (as has been ob&s;erved above,) part of the time out of commi&s;&s;ion, by breaking the regiment to which he belong|ed, of which before he was major. This was, in all pro|bability, the gaye&s;t part of his life, and the mo&s;t criminal. Whatever wi&s;e and good examples he might find in the fa|mily where he had the honour to re&s;ide it is certain that the French court, during the regency of the Duke of Or|leans, was one of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute under heaven. What, by a wretched abu&s;e of language, have been called intrigues of love and gallantry, were &s;o entirely to the major's then degenerate ta&s;te, that if not the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t the whole happine&s;s of his life con&s;i&s;ted in them; and he had now too much lei&s;ure, for one who was &s;o prone to abu&s;e it. His fine con&s;titution, than which perhaps there was hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y ever a better, gave him great opportunities of indulging him&s;elf in the&s;e exce&s;&s;es; and his good &s;pirits enabled him

to pur&s;ue his plea&s;ures of every kind, in &s;o alert and &s;pright|ly a manner, that multitudes envied him, and called him, by a dreadful kind of compliment, "the Happy Rake."</P>

Yet &s;till the checks of con&s;cience, and &s;ome re|maining principles of &s;o good an education, would break in upon his mo&s;t licentious hours; and I particularly remem|ber he told me, that when &s;ome of his di&s;&s;olute companions were once congratulating him on his di&s;tingui&s;hed felicity, a dog happening at that time to come into the room, he could not forbear groaning inwardly, and &s;aying to him&s;elf, "Oh that I were that dog!" Such was then his happine&s;s; and &s;uch perhaps is that of hundreds more, who bear them|&s;elves highe&s;t in the contempt of religion, and glory in that infamous &s;ervitude which they affect to call liberty, But the&s;e remon&s;trances of rea&s;on and con&s;cience were in vain; and, in &s;hort, he carried things &s;o far, in this wretched part of his life, that I am well a&s;&s;ured, &s;ome &s;ober Engli&s;h gentlemen, who made no great pretences to religion, how agreeable &s;oever he might have been to them on other ac|counts, rather declined than &s;ought his company, as fearing they might have been in&s;nared and corrupted by it.</P>
<P N="24">&sect;. 24. Yet I cannot find, that in the&s;e mo&s;t abandoned days, he was fond of drinking. Indeed he never had any natural reli&s;h for that kind of intemperance, from which he u&s;ed to think a manly pride might be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit; as by it they give up every thing that di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the meane&s;t of their &s;pecies, or indeed from animals the mo&s;t below it. So that, if he ever fell into any exce&s;&s;es of this kind, it was merely out of complai&s;ance to his company, and that he might not ap|pear &s;tiff and &s;ingular. His frank, obliging, and generous temper, procured him many friends; and the&s;e principles, which rendered him amiable to others, not being under the direction of true wi&s;dom and piety, &s;ometimes made him, in the ways of living he pur&s;ued, more unea&s;y to him&s;elf, than he might perhaps have been if he could entirely have out-grown them; e&s;pecially as he was never a &s;ceptic in his principles, but &s;till retained a &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion, that na|tural and revealed religion, though he did not much care to think of either, were &s;ounded in truth.

His continual neglect of the great Author of his being, of who&s;e perfections he could not doubt, and to whom he knew him&s;elf to be under daily and perpetual obli|gations, gave him, in &s;ome moments of involuntary reflec|tion, inexpre&s;&s;ible remor&s;e; and this, at times, wrought upon him to &s;uch a degree, that he re&s;olved he would at|tempt to pay him &s;ome acknowledgements. Accordingly for a few mornings he did it; repeating in retirement &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages out of the P&s;alms, and perhaps other &s;criptures, which he &s;till retained in his memory; and owning, in a few &s;trong words, the many mercies and deliverances he had received, and the ill returns he had made for them.</P>

And I believe it was this, toge|ther with the de&s;ire of avoiding every thing that might look like oftentation on this head, that prevented his leaving a writ|ten account of it; though I have often entreated him to do it: As I particularly remember I did, in the very la&s;t letter I ever wrote him, and pleaded the po&s;&s;ibility of his falling a|mid&s;t tho&s;e dangers, to which I knew his valour might in &s;uch circum&s;tances naturally expo&s;e him. I was not &s;o hap|py as to receive any an&s;wer to this letter, which reached him but a few days before his death: nor can I certainly &s;ay, whether he had, or had not, complied with my reque&s;t; as it is very po&s;&s;ible, a paper of that kind, if it were writ|ten, might be lo&s;t amid&s;t the ravages which the rebels made, when they plundered Bankton.</P>

The &s;tory however was &s;o remaakable, that I had little rea&s;on to apprehend I &s;hould ever forget it; and yet, to guard again&s;t all contingencies of that kind, I wrote it down that very evening, as I had heard it from his own mouth: And I have now before me the memoirs of that conver&s;ation, dated Aug. 14, 1739, which conclude with the&s;e words; (which I added, that if we &s;hould both have died that night, the world might not have lo&s;t this edifying and affecting hi&s;|tory, or have wanted any atte&s;tation of it I was capable of giving;) <Q>N. B. I have written down this account with

all the exactne&s;s I am capable of, and could &s;afely take an oath of it as to the truth of every circum&s;tance, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, as the Colonel related it to me a few hours ago.</Q> I do not know, that I had reviewed this paper &s;ince I wrote it, till I &s;et my&s;elf thus publicly to record this extraordinary fact; but I find it punctually to a|gree with what I have often related from my memory, which I charged carefully with &s;o wonderful and important a fact. It is with all &s;olemnity that I now deliver it down to po&s;te|rity, as in the &s;ight and pre&s;ence of God. And I choo&s;e deliberately to expo&s;e my&s;elf to tho&s;e &s;evere cen&s;ures, which the haughty, but empty, &s;corn of infidelity, or principles nearly approaching it, and effectually doing its pernicious work, may very probably dictate upon the occa&s;ion; rather than to &s;mother a relation, which may in the judgment of my con&s;cience, be like to conduce &s;o much to the glory of God, the honour of the go&s;pel, and the good of man|kind. One thing more I will only premi&s;e, that I hope, none who have heard the Colonel him&s;elf &s;peak &s;omething of this wonderful &s;cene, will be &s;urprized if they find &s;ome new circum&s;tances here; becau&s;e he a&s;&s;ured me at the time he fir&s;t gave me the whole narration, (which was in the very room in which I now write,) that he had never imparted it &s;o fully to any man living before. Yet, at the &s;ame time, he gave me full liberty to communicate it to whom&s;oever I &s;hould in my con&s;cience judge it might be u&s;eful to do it, whe|ther before, or after his death. Accordingly I did, while he was alive, recount almo&s;t every circum&s;tance I am now going to write, to &s;everal pious friends; referring them at the &s;ame time to the colonel him&s;elf, whenever they might have an opportunity of &s;eeing or writing to him, for a far|ther confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ation of what I told them, if they judged it re|qui&s;ite.

The major had &s;pent the evening (and if I mi&s;take not, it was the Sabbath,) in &s;ome gay company, and had an unhappy a&s;&s;ignation with a married woman, of what rank or quality, I did not particularly enquire, whom he was to attend ex|actly at twelve. The company broke up about eleven; and not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appoint|ed, he went into his chamber, to kill the tedious hour, perhaps with &s;ome amu&s;ing book or &s;ome other way. But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book, which his good mother or aunt had, without his know|ledge, &s;lipped into his portmanteau. It was called, if I remember the title exactly, The Chri&s;tian Soldier, or Heaven taken by Storm; and was written by Mr. Tho|mas Wat&s;on. Gue&s;&s;ing by the title of it, that he &s;hould find &s;ome phra&s;es of his own profe&s;&s;ion &s;piritualized, in a manner which he thought might afford him &s;ome diver&s;ion, he re|&s;olved to dip into it: but he took no &s;erious notice of any thing he read in it: And yet, while this book was in his hand, an impre&s;&s;ion was made upon his mind (perhaps God only knows how,) which drew after it a train of the mo&s;t important and happy con&s;equences.</P>

There is indeed a po&s;&s;ibility, that while he was &s;itting in this attitude, and reading in this carele&s;s and pro|fane manner, he might &s;uddenly fall a&s;leep, and only dream of what he apprehended he &s;aw. But nothing can be more certain, than that, when he gave me this relation, he judg|ed him&s;elf to have been as broad awake during the whole time, as he ever was in any part of his life; and he men|tioned it to me &s;everal times afterwards, as what undoubt|edly

pa&s;&s;ed, not only in his imagination, but before his eyes.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Spears, in the letter mentioned above, where he intro|duces the Colonel telling his own &s;tory, has the&s;e words: <Q>All of a &s;udden there was pre&s;ented in a very lively manner to my view or to my mind, a repre&s;entation of my glorious Re|deemer, &amp;c."&mdash;And this gentleman adds, in a parenthe&s;is, It was &s;o lively and &s;triking, that he could not tell, whether it was to his bodily eyes, or to tho&s;e of his mind.</Q> This makes me think, that what I had &s;aid to him on the Phaenomena of vi&s;ions, apparitions, &amp;c. [as being, when mo&s;t real, &s;uper|natural impre&s;&s;ions on the imagination, rather than attended with any external object,] had &s;ome influence upon him. Yet &s;till it is evident, he looked upon this as a vi&s;ion, whether it were before the eyes, or in the mind, and not as a dream.</NOTE></P>
<P N="32">&sect;. 32. He thought he &s;aw an unu&s;ual blaze of light fall on the book while he was reading, which he at fir&s;t imagin|ed might happen by &s;ome accident in the candle. But lifting up his eyes, he apprehended, to his extreme amazement, that there was before him, as it were &s;u&s;pended in the air, a vi&s;ible repre&s;entation of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon the cro&s;s, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with a glory; and was im|pre&s;&s;ed, as if a voice, or &s;omething equivalent to a voice, had come to him, to this effect, (for he was not confident as to the very words,) <Q>Oh &s;inner, did I &s;uffer this for thee, and are the&s;e the returns?</Q> But whether this were an audible voice, or only a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his mind equally &s;triking, he did not &s;eem very confident; though, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, he rather judged it to be the for|mer. Struck with &s;o amazing a phaenomenon as this, there remained hardly any life in him, &s;o that he &s;unk down in the arm-chair in which he &s;at, and continued, he knew not exactly how long, in&s;en&s;ible; (which was one circum&s;tance, that made me &s;everal times take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t, that he might po&s;&s;ibly be all this while a&s;leep:) but however that were, he quickly after opened his eyes, and &s;aw nothing more than u&s;ual.</P>

Nor did he, throughout all the remainder of the night, once recollect that criminal and dete&s;table a&s;&s;ignation, which had before engro&s;&s;ed all his

thoughts. He ro&s;e in a tumult of pa&s;&s;ions, not to be con|ceived; and walked to and fro in his chamber, till he was ready to drop down, in unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment and agony of heart; appearing to him&s;elf the vile&s;t mon&s;ter in the creation of God, who had all his life-time been crucifying Chri&s;t afre&s;h by his &s;ins, and now &s;aw, as he a&s;&s;uredly be|lieved, by a miraculous vi&s;ion, the horror of what he had done. With this was connected &s;uch a view, both of the maje&s;ty and goodne&s;s of God, as cau&s;ed him to loath and abhor him&s;elf, and to repent as in du&s;t and a&s;hes. He im|mediately gave judgment again&s;t him&s;elf, that he was mo&s;t ju&s;tly worthy of eternal damnation: He was a&s;toni&s;hed, that he had not been immediately &s;truck dead in the mid&s;t of his wickedne&s;s: And (which I think de&s;erves particular remark,) though he a&s;&s;uredly believed that he &s;hould ere long be in hell, and &s;ettled it as a point with him&s;elf for &s;e|veral months, that the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of God did almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily require, that &s;uch an enormous &s;inner &s;hould be made an example of everla&s;ting vengeance, and a &s;pectacle as &s;uch both to angels and men, &s;o that he hardly dur&s;t pre|&s;ume to pray for pardon; yet what he then &s;uffered, was not &s;o much from the fear of hell, though he concluded it would &s;oon be his portion, as from a &s;en&s;e of that horrible ingratitude he had &s;hewn to the God of his life, and to that ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, who had been in &s;o affecting a manner &s;et forth as crucified before him.</P>

Where I make any extracts as from Colonel Gardi|ner's letters, they are either from originals, which I have in my own hands, or from copies, which were tran&s;mitted to me from per&s;ons of undoubted credit, chiefly by the right honorable the lady Frances Gardiner, through the hand of the Rev.

This I the rather men|tion, becau&s;e &s;ome letters have been brought to me as Colonel Gardiner's, concerning which, I have not only been very dubi|ous, but morally certain, that they could not have been written by him.

I do not remember that I ever told to any other per&s;on.

<P N="35">&sect;. 35 In this view it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night waking; and he could get but little re&s;t in &s;everal that followed His mind was continually taken up in reflecting on the divine purity and goodne&s;s; the grace which had been propo&s;ed to him in the go&s;pel, and which he had rejected; the &s;ingular advantages he had enjoyed and abu&s;ed; and the many favours of provi|dence which he had received, particularly in re&s;cuing him from &s;o many eminent dangers of death, which he now &s;aw mu&s;t have been attended with &s;uch dreadful and hopele&s;s de|&s;truction. The privileges of his education, which he had &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, now lay with an almo&s;t in&s;upportable weight on his mind; and the folly of that career of &s;inful plea&s;ure, which he had &s;o many years been running with de&s;perate eagerne&s;s and unworthy delight, now filled him with indignation again&s;t him&s;elf, and again&s;t the great de|ceiver, by whom (to u&s;e his own phra&s;e,) he had been "&s;o wretchedly and &s;candalou&s;ly be fooled." This he u&s;ed often to expre&s;s in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; which I &s;hall not repeat &s;o particularly, as I cannot recollect &s;ome of them. But on the whole, it is certain, that by what pa&s;&s;ed before he left his chamber the next day, the whole frame and di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;oul was new-modelled and changed; &s;o that he be|came, and continued to the la&s;t day of his exemplary and truly chri&s;tian life, the very rever&s;e of what he had been before. A variety of particulars, which I am afterwards to mention, will illu&s;trate this in the mo&s;t convincing man|ner.

But I cannot proceed to them, without pau&s;ing a while to adore &s;o illu&s;trious an in&s;tance of the power and freedom of divine grace, and intreating my reader &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon it, that his own heart may be &s;uitably affected. For &s;urely if the truth of the fact be admitted, in the lowe&s;t views in which it can be placed, (that is, &s;uppo&s;ing the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion to have pa&s;&s;ed in a dream,) it mu&s;t be allowed to have been little, if any thing, le&s;s than miraculous. It can|not in the cour&s;e of nature be imagined, how &s;uch a dream &s;hould ari&s;e in a mind, full of the mo&s;t impure ideas and af|fections, and (as he him&s;elf often pleaded,) more alienated from the thoughts of a crucified Saviour, than from any o|ther object that can be conceived: Nor can we &s;urely &s;up|po&s;e, it &s;hould, without a mighty energy of the divine power, be effectual to produce, not only &s;ome tran&s;ient flow of pa&s;|&s;ion, but &s;o entire and &s;o permanent a change in character and conduct.</P>
<P N="36">&sect;. 36. On the whole therefore, I mu&s;t beg leave to ex|pre&s;s my own &s;entiments of the matter, by repeating on this occa&s;ion what I wrote &s;everal years ago, in my eighth &s;ermon on regeneration, in a pa&s;&s;age dictated chiefly by the circum&s;tantial knowledge which I had of this amazing &s;tory, and methinks &s;ufficiently vindicated by it, if it &s;tood entire|ly alone; which yet, I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, it does not: for I hope the world will be particularly informed, that there is at lea&s;t a &s;econd, that very nearly approaches it, whenever the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England &s;hall lo&s;e one of its brighte&s;t living ornaments, and one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful members, which that, or perhaps any other chri&s;tian communion, can bea&s;t: In the mean time, may his exem|plary life be long continued, and his zealous mini&s;try abun|dantly pro&s;pered! I beg my reader's pardon for this digre&s;|&s;ion. The pa&s;&s;age I referred to above is remarkably, though not equally, applicable to both the ca&s;es, as it &s;tands in page 263, of the fir&s;t edition, and page 160, of the &s;econd; under that head, where I am &s;hewing, that God &s;ometimes accompli&s;hes the great work of which we &s;peak, by &s;ecret and immediate impre&s;&s;ions on the mind.

The mind of major Gardiner continued from this remarkable time till towards the end of October, (that is, rather more than three months, but e&s;pecially the two fir&s;t of them,) in as extraordinary a &s;ituation as one can well imagine; he knew nothing of the joys ari&s;ing from a &s;en&s;e of pardon; but on the contrary, for the greater part of that time, and with very &s;hort intervals of hope toward the end of it, took it for granted, that he mu&s;t, in all probability, quickly peri&s;h.

He therefore exerted his natural courage in a very new kind of combat, and became an open advocate for religion, in all its principles, &s;o far as he was acquainted with them, and all its precepts, relating to &s;o|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iety, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and godline&s;s. Yet he was very de|&s;irous and cautious, that he might not run into an extreme, and made it one of his fir&s;t petitions to God, the very day after the&s;e amazing impre&s;&s;ions had been wrought in his mind, that he might not be &s;uffered to behave with &s;uch an effected &s;trictne&s;s and preci&s;ene&s;s, as would lead others a|bout him into mi&s;taken notions of religion, and expo&s;e it to reproach or &s;u&s;picion, as if it were an unlovely or uncom|fortable thing.

He told his mo&s;t intimate companions freely, that he had reflected on the cour&s;e of life in which he had &s;o long joined them, and found it to be folly and madne&s;s, unworthy a rational crea|ture, and much more unworthy per&s;ons calling them&s;elves chri&s;tians.

well known in the grand and the gay world, I mu&s;t beg leave to conceal,) who had imbibed the principles of dei&s;m, and valued her&s;elf much upon being an avowed advocate for them. The major, with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s, (though I doubt not with that politene&s;s of manners, which was &s;o habitual to him, and which he retained throughout his whole life,) an&s;wered her, like a man who perfectly &s;aw through the fallacy of her arguments, and was grieved to the heart for her delu&s;ion. On this &s;he bri&s;kly challenged him to de|bate the matter at large, and to fix upon a day for that pur|po&s;e, when he &s;hould dine with her, attended with any clergyman he might chu&s;e, whether of the prote&s;tant, or catholic communion. A &s;en&s;e of duty would not allow him to decline this challenge; and yet he had no &s;ooner accepted it, but he was thrown into great perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, left being (as I remember he expre&s;&s;ed it, when he told me the &s;tory,) only a chri&s;tian of &s;ix weeks old, he &s;hould prejudice &s;o good a cau&s;e, by his un&s;kilful manner of defending it. However, he &s;ought his refuge in earne&s;t and repeated pray|ers to God, that he who can ordain &s;trength, and perfect prai&s;e, out of the mouth of babes and &s;ucklings, would gra|ciou&s;ly enable him, on this occa&s;ion, to vindicate his truths in a manner which might carry conviction along with it. He then endeavoured to mar&s;hal the arguments in his own mind, as well as he could; and apprehending that he could not &s;peak with &s;o much freedom before a number of per&s;ons, e&s;pecially before &s;uch, who&s;e province he might in that ea&s;e &s;eem to invade, if he had not devolved the princi|pal part of the di&s;cour&s;e upon them, he ea&s;ily admitted the apology of a clergyman or two, to whom he mentioned the affair and waited on the lady alone upon the day appointed. But his heart was &s;o &s;et upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, that he came earlier than he was expected, and time enough to have two hours di&s;cour&s;e before dinner; nor did he at all decline hav|ing two young per&s;ons, nearly related to the lady, pre&s;ent during the conference.</P>

religion is mo&s;t apparently connected. And it was a great encouragement to him, to find, that unaccu&s;tomed as he was to di&s;cour&s;es of this nature, he had an unu&s;ual command, both of thought, and expre&s;&s;ion; &s;o that he recollected, and uttered every thing, as he could have wi&s;hed. The lady heard with attention; and though he pau&s;ed between every branch of the argument, &s;he did not interrupt the cour&s;e of it, till he told her, he had fini&s;hed his de&s;ign, and waited for her reply. She then produced &s;ome of her objections, which he took up and canva&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that at length &s;he bur&s;t out into tears, allowed the force of his ar|guments and replies, and appeared, for &s;ome time after, &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the conver&s;ation, that it was ob&s;erved by &s;everal of her friends: and there is rea&s;on to believe, that the impre&s;&s;ion continued at lea&s;t &s;o far as to prevent her from ever appearing under the character of an unbeliever or a &s;ceptic.</P>

But this &s;en&s;ible triumph over the&s;e difficulties was not, till his chri&s;tian experience had been abundantly advan|ced, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the &s;ermons he heard, (par|ticularly in the Swi&s;s chapel,) and on the many hours which he &s;pent in devout retirement, pouring out his whole &s;oul be|fore God in prayer He began, within about two months after his fir&s;t memorable change, to perceive &s;ome &s;ecret dawnings of more chearful hope, that vile as he &s;aw him&s;elf to be, (and I believe no words can expre&s;s, how vile that was,) he might neverthele&s;s obtain mercy through a Redeemer. And at length, (if I remember right, about the end of October, 1719,) he found all the burthen of his mind taken off at once, by the powerful impre&s;&s;ion of that memorable &s;crip|ture upon his mind; Rom iii 25, 26. <Q>Whom God hath &s;et forth for a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s in the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,&mdash;that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je|&s;us.</Q> He had u&s;ed to imagine, that the ju&s;tice of God re|quired the damnation of &s;o enormous a &s;inner, as he &s;aw him|&s;elf to be. But now he was made deeply &s;en&s;ible, that the divine ju&s;tice might be, not only vindicated, but glorified, in &s;aving him by the blood of Je&s;us, even that blood which "clean&s;eth us from all &s;in." Then did he &s;ee, and feel, the riches of redeeming love and grace, in &s;uch a manner, as not only engaged him, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure and con|fidence to venture his &s;oul upon it; but even &s;wallowed up, (as it were) his whole heart in the returns of love, which from that ble&s;&s;ed time became the genuine and delightful prin|ciple of his obedience, and animated him with an enlarged heart, to run the way of God's commandments. Thus God was plea&s;ed, (as he him&s;elf u&s;ed to &s;peak,) in an hour to turn his captivity. All the terrors of his former &s;tate were changed into unutterable joy, which kept him almo&s;t conti|nually
<PB N="35" REF="028578_0018_0FD973009BBCA5A0">
waking for three nights together and yet refre&s;hed him as the noble&s;t of cordials. His expre&s;&s;ions, though na|turally very &s;trong, always &s;eemed to be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allowed up, when he would de&s;cribe the &s;eries of thought through which he now pa&s;&s;ed, under the rapturous experience of that joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory, which then &s;eemed to over|flow his very &s;oul; as indeed there was nothing he &s;eemed to &s;peak of with greater reli&s;h. And though the fir&s;t exta|&s;ies of it afterwards &s;ub&s;ided into a more calm and compo&s;ed delight; yet were the impre&s;&s;ions &s;o deep, and &s;o perma|nent, that he a&s;&s;ured me, on the word of a chri&s;tian and a friend, wonderful as it might &s;eem, that for about &s;even years after this he enjoyed almo&s;t an heaven upon earth. His &s;oul was &s;o continually filled with a &s;en&s;e of the love of God in Chri&s;t, that it knew little interruption, but when nece&s;&s;ary conver&s;e, and the duties of his &s;tation, called off his thoughts for a little time: And when they did &s;o, as &s;oon as he was alone, the torrent returned into its natural channel again; &s;o that from the minute of his awakening in the morning, his heart was ri&s;ing to God, and triumphing in him; and the&s;e thoughts attended him through all the &s;cenes of life, till he lay down on his bed again, and a &s;hort parenthe&s;is of &s;leep (for it was but a very &s;hort one that he allowed him&s;elf,) invigorated his animal powers, for renew|ing them with greater inten&s;ene&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>

Many of them were written in the mo&s;t ha&s;ty manner, ju&s;t as the courier who brought them was, perhaps unexpectedly, &s;etting out; and they relate chiefly to affairs in which the public is not at all concerned: Yet there is not one of them, in which he has not in&s;erted &s;ome warm and genuine &s;entiment of religion.

Mr. Edmund Calamy, one of the letters which the Doctor his father wrote to the major on this wonderful occa&s;ion. I perceive by the con|tents of it, that it was the fir&s;t; and indeed it is dated as early as the third of Augu&s;t, 1719, which mu&s;t be but a few days after his own account, dated Aug. 4. N.

N. S. which brought her the news you conceive would be &s;o acceptable to her. I, who have often been a witne&s;s to her con|cern for you on a &s;piritual account, can atte&s;t with what joy this news was received by her, and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted to me as a &s;pecial friend, who &s;he knew would bear a part with her on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. And indeed, if (as our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aviour intimates, Luke xv. 7, 10.) there is in &s;uch ca&s;es joy in heaven, and among the angels of God, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that of a pious mother, who has &s;pent &s;o many prayers and tears upon you, and has as it were travailed in birth with you again, till Chri&s;t was formed in you, could not be &s;mall. You may believe me if I add, that I al&s;o, as a common friend of her's and your's, and which is much more of the Prince of Light, whom you now de|clare you heartily fall in with, in oppo&s;ition to that of the dark kingdom, could not but be tenderly affected with an account of it under your own hand. My joy on this ac|count was the greater, con&s;idering the importance of your capacity, intere&s;ts, and pro&s;pects; which, in &s;uch an age as this, may promi&s;e mo&s;t happy con&s;equences, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your heartily appearing on God's &s;ide, and embarking in the intere&s;t of our dear Redeemer. If I have hitherto at all remembered you at the throne of grace, at your good mother's de&s;ire, (which you are plea&s;ed to take notice of with &s;o much re&s;pect,) I can a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall hence-for|ward be led to do it, with more concern and particulari|ty, both by duty and inclination. And if I were capa|ble of giving you any little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the noble de&s;ign you are engaging in, by corre&s;ponding with you by letter, while you are at &s;uch a di&s;tance, I &s;hould do it mo&s;t chear|fully. And perhaps, &s;uch a motion may not be altoge|ther unacceptable: For I am inclinable to believe, that when &s;ome, whom you are obliged to conver&s;e with, ob|&s;erve your behaviour &s;o different from what it formerly was, and banter you upon it as mad and fanciful, it may be &s;ome little relief to corre&s;pond with one, who will take a plea&s;ure in heartening and encouraging you. And when a great many things frequently offer, in which con|&s;cience may be concerned, where duty may not always

be plain, nor &s;uitable per&s;ons to advi&s;e with at hand, it may be &s;ome &s;atisfaction to you to corre&s;pond with one, with whom you may u&s;e a friendly freedom in all &s;uch matters, and on who&s;e fidelity you may depend. You may therefore command me in any of the&s;e re&s;pects, and I &s;hall take a plea&s;ure in &s;erving you. One piece of ad|vice I &s;hall venture to give you, though your own good &s;en&s;e will make my enlarging upon it le&s;s needful; I mean that you would, from your fir&s;t &s;etting&punc; out carefully di&s;|tingui&s;h between the e&s;&s;entials of real religion, and tho&s;e things which are commonly reckoned by its profe&s;&s;ors to belong &s;o it. The want of this di&s;tinction has had very unhappy con&s;equences from one age to another, and per|haps in none more than the pre&s;ent. But your daily con|ver&s;e with your bible, which you mention, may herein give you great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I move al&s;o, that &s;ince infidel|ity &s;o much abounds, you would not only, by clo&s;e and &s;erious con&s;ideration, endeavour to &s;ettle your&s;elf well in the fundamental principles of religion, but al&s;o that, as opportunity offers, you would conver&s;e with tho&s;e books which treat mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly on the divine original of chri&s;|tianity, &s;uch as Grotius, Abadie, Baxter, Bates, Du Ple&s;&s;is, &amp;c. which may e&s;tabli&s;h you again&s;t the cavils that occur in almo&s;t all conver&s;ations, and furni&s;h you with arguments which, when properly offered, may be of u&s;e to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions on others. But being too much &s;traitened to enlarge at pre&s;ent, I can only add, that if your hearty falling in with &s;erious religion &s;hould prove any hindrance to your advancement in the world, (which I pray God it may not, unle&s;s &s;uch advancement would be a real &s;nare to you,) I hope you wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tru&s;t our Saviour's word, that it &s;hall be no di&s;advantage to you in the final i&s;&s;ue: He has given you his word for it, Matt. xix. 29. upon which you may &s;afely depend; and I am &s;atisfied, none that ever did &s;o at la&s;t repented of it.

I think it very evident from the contents of this letter, that the major had not imparted to his mother the mo&s;t &s;ingular circum&s;tances attending his conver&s;ion: And indeed there was &s;omething &s;o peculiar in them, that I do not wonder, he was always cautious in &s;peaking of them,
<PB N="41" REF="028578_0021_0FD973056B9EDAD8">
and e&s;pecially, that he was at fir&s;t much on the re&s;erve. We may al&s;o naturally reflect, that there &s;eems to have been &s;omething very providential in this letter, con&s;idering the debate in which our illu&s;trious convert was &s;o &s;oon engaged. For it was written but about three weeks, before his con|ference with the lady above mentioned in the defence of chri&s;tianity; or at lea&s;t, before the appointment of it. And as &s;ome of the books recommended by Dr. Calamy, parti|cularly Abadie and Du Ple&s;&s;is were undoubtedly within his reach, (if our Engli&s;h advocates were not) this might, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing contribute con&s;iderably towards arming him for that combat, in which he came off with &s;uch happy &s;ucce&s;s. And as in this in&s;tance, &s;o in many others, they who will ob&s;erve the coincidence and concurrence of things, may be engaged to adore the wi&s;e conduct of providence in events, which, when taken &s;ingly and by them&s;elves, have nothing very remarkable in them.</P>
<P N="50">&sect;. 50. I think it was about this time, that this re&s;olute and examplary chri&s;tian entered upon that methodical man|ner of living, which be pur&s;ued through &s;o many &s;ucceeding years of life, and I believe, generally, &s;o far as the broken &s;tate of his health would allow it in his latter days, to the very end of it. He u&s;ed con&s;tantly to ri&s;e at four in the morning, and to &s;pend his time till &s;ix in the &s;ecret exer|ci&s;es of devotion, reading, meditation, and prayer; in which la&s;t he contracted &s;uch a fervency of &s;pirit, as I be|lieve few men living ever obtained. This certainly tended very much to &s;trengthen that firm faith in God, and rever|end animating &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence, for which he was &s;o eminently remarkable, and which carried him through the trials and &s;ervices of life, with &s;uch &s;teadine&s;s, and with &s;uch activity; for he indeed endured, and acted, as always &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible. If at any time he was obliged to go out before &s;ix in the morning, he ro&s;e proportionably &s;ooner; &s;o that when a journey, or a march, has required him to be on hor&s;e back by four, he would be at his devo|tions at farthe&s;t by two. He likewi&s;e &s;ecured time for re|tirement in an evening; and that he might have it the more at command, and be the more fit to u&s;e it properly as well as the better able to ri&s;e early the next morning, he gener|ally went to bed about ten: And, during the time I was

acquainted with him, he &s;eldom at any &s;upper, but a mouth|ful of bread with one gla&s;s of wine. In con&s;equence of this, as well as of his admirably good con&s;titution, and the long habit he had formed, he required le&s;s &s;leep than mo&s;t per|&s;ons I have known: And I doubt not, but his uncommon progre&s;s in piety was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the&s;e re|&s;olute habits of &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P N="51">&sect;. 51. A life any thing like this, could not, to be &s;ure, be entered upon, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch company as he had been accu&s;tomed to keep, without great oppo&s;ition: E&s;peci|ally, as he did not entirely withdraw him&s;elf from all the circle of chearful conver&s;ation; but on the contrary, gave &s;e|veral hours every day to it, le&s;t religion &s;hould be reproach|ed, as having made him moro&s;e. He however early began a practice, which to the la&s;t day of his life he retained, of reproving vice and profanene&s;s; and was never afraid to debate the matter with any, under the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch &s;uperiority in the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="52">&sect;. 52. A remarkable in&s;tance of this happened, if I mi&s;|take not, about the middle of the year 1720, though I can|not be very exact as to the date of the &s;tory. It was howe|ver on his fir&s;t return, to make any con&s;iderable abode in England, after this remarkable change. He had heard, on the other &s;ide of the water, that it was currently reported among his companions at home, that he was &s;tark mad: A report, at which no reader, who knows the wi&s;dom of the world in the&s;e matters, will be much &s;urprized, any more than him&s;elf. He concluded therefore, that he &s;hould have many battles to fight, and was willing to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s as fa&s;t as he could. And therefore, being to &s;pend a few days at the country hou&s;e of a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, with whom he had been very intimate, (who&s;e name I do not remember that he told me, nor did I think it pro|per to enquire after it,) he begged the favour of him that he would contrive matters &s;o, that a day or two after he came down, &s;everal of their former gay companions might meet at his lord&s;hip's table&punc; that he might have an appor|tunity of making his apology to them, and acquainting them with the nature and rea&s;ons of his change. It was accord+ingly agreed to; and a pretty large company met on the da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appointed, with previous notice that major Gardiner would be there. A good deal of raillery pa&s;&s;ed at dinner, to which
<PB N="43" REF="028578_0022_0FD973074B846128">
the major made very little an&s;wer. But when the cloth was taken away, and the &s;ervants retired, he begged their pa|tience for a few minutes, and then plainly and &s;eriou&s;ly told them, what notions he entertained of virtue and religi|on, and on what con&s;iderations he had ab&s;olutely determin|ed that by the grace of God he would make it the care and bu&s;ine&s;s of life, whatever he might lo&s;e by it, and whatever cen&s;ure and contempt he might incur. He well knew how improper it was in &s;uch company, to relate the extraordinary manner in which he was awakened; which they would pro|bably have interpreted as a demon&s;tration of lunacy, again&s;t all the gravity and &s;olidity of his di&s;cour&s;e: But he content|ed him&s;elf with &s;uch a rational defence of a righteous, &s;ober, and godly life, as he knew none of them could with any &s;hadow of rea&s;on conte&s;t. He then challenged them to pro|po&s;e any thing they could urge, to prove that a life of irre|ligion and debauchery was preferable to the fear, love, and wor&s;hip of the eternal God, and a conduct agreeable to the precepts of his go&s;pel. And he &s;ailed not to bear his te&s;ti|mony from his own experience, (to one part of which many of them had been witne&s;&s;es) that after having run the wid|e&s;t round of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, with all the advantages the be&s;t con&s;titution and &s;pirits could give him, he had never ta&s;ted any thing that de&s;erved to be called happine&s;s, till he had made religion his refuge and his delight. He te&s;tified calm|ly and boldly, the habitual &s;erenity and peace that he now felt in his own brea&s;t, (for the mo&s;t elevated delights he did not think fit to plead, lea&s;t they &s;hould be e&s;teemed en|thu&s;ia&s;m,) and the compo&s;ure and plea&s;ure with which he looked forward to objects, which the gaye&s;t &s;inner mu&s;t ac|knowledge to be equally unavoidable and dreadful.</P>

I know not what might be attempted by &s;ome of the company in an&s;wer to this; but I well remember he told me, the ma&s;ter of the table, a per&s;on of a very frank and candid di&s;po&s;ition, cut &s;hort the debate, and &s;aid, <Q>Come, let us call another cau&s;e: We thought this man mad, and he is in good earne&s;t proving that we are &s;o.</Q> On the whole, this well judged circum&s;tance &s;aved him a great deal of future trouble. When his former acquaintance ob&s;erved, that he was &s;till conver&s;able and innocently chearful, and that he was immoveable in his re&s;olutions, they de&s;i&s;ted from farther importunity. And he has a&s;&s;ured me that

in&s;tead of lo&s;ing any one valuable friend by this change in his character, he found him&s;elf much more e&s;teemed and re|garded, by many who could not per&s;uade them&s;elves to imi|tate his example.</P>

As his good mother al&s;o belonged to the &s;ame, it is ea&s;y to imagine, it mu&s;t be an un&s;peakable plea&s;ure to her, to have &s;uch frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with &s;uch a &s;on, of ob&s;erving in his daily conduct and di&s;cour&s;es the ble&s;&s;ed effects of that change which divine grace had made in his heart, and of &s;itting down with him monthly at that &s;acred fea&s;t, where chri&s;tians &s;o frequently enjoy the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vine&s;t entertainments which they expect on this &s;ide heaven.

He had maintained her hand&s;omely out of that very moderate in|come, on which he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ince his regiment had been di&s;|banded; and when &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude to him for it, he a&s;&s;ured her, (I think, in one of the la&s;t letters &s;he ever re|ceived from him,) <Q>that he e&s;teemed it a great honour, that God put it into his power, to make what he cal|led, a very &s;mall acknowledgement of all her care fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, and e&s;pecially of the many prayers &s;he had offered on his account, which had already been remarkably an|&s;wered, and the benefit of which he hoped ever to enjoy.</Q></P>

This was the la&s;t action of the kind in which he was engaged, before the long peace which en&s;ued: And who can expre&s;s, how happy it was for him, and indeed for his country, of which he was ever &s;o generous, and in his latter years &s;o important a friend, that he did not fall then; when the profanene&s;s which min|gled it&s;elf with his martial rage, &s;eemed to rend the heavens, and &s;hocked &s;ome other military gentlemen, who were not them&s;elves remarkable for their caution in this re&s;pect.</P>

The duties of the clo&s;et, and of the &s;anctuary, were &s;o adju&s;ted, as not to interfere with tho&s;e of the parade, or any other place where the welfare of the regiment called him.

It could not but greatly endear him to his &s;oldiers, that &s;o far as preferments lay in his power, or were under his influence, they were di&s;tributed according to merit; which he knew to be as much the dictate of prudence, as of equity. I find by one of his letters before me, dated a few months before his happy change, that he was &s;olicited to im|prove his intere&s;t with the Earl of Stair, in favour of one whom he judged a very worthy per&s;on; and that he had been &s;ugge&s;ted by another who recommended him, that if he &s;uc|ceeded he might expect &s;ome hand&s;ome acknowledgment.

<P N="90">&sect; 90. In the mid&s;t of all the gentlene&s;s which Colonel Gardiner exerci&s;ed towards his &s;oldiers, he made it very ap|parent, that he knew how to reconcile the tenderne&s;s of a real faithful, and conde&s;cending friend, with the authority of a commander. Perhaps hardly any thing conduced more generally to the maintaining of this authority, than the &s;trict decorum and good manners, with which he treated even the private gentlemen of his regiment; which has always a great efficacy towards keeping inferiors at a proper di&s;tance, and forbids, in the lea&s;t offen&s;ive manner, familiarities, which degrade the &s;uperior, and enervate his influence. The calmne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s of his behaviour on all occa&s;ions, did al&s;o greatly tend to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. He knew, how mean a man looks in the tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, and would not u&s;e &s;o much freedom with any of his men, as to fall into &s;uch tran&s;ports before them; well knowing, that per&s;ons in the lowe&s;t rank of life are aware, how unfit they are to govern others, who cannot govern them&s;elves. He was al&s;o &s;en&s;i|ble, how nece&s;&s;ary it is in all who pre&s;ide over others, and e&s;pecially in military officers, to check irregularities, when they fir&s;t begin to appear: And that he might be able to do it, he kept a &s;trict in&s;pection over his &s;oldiers; in which view it was ob&s;erved, that as he generally cho&s;e to re&s;ide among them as much as he could, (though in circum&s;tances which &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned him to deny him&s;elf in &s;ome intere&s;ts which were very dear to him,) &s;o when they were around him, he &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid long in a place: but was frequently walking the &s;treets, and looking into their quarters and &s;ta|bles, as well as reviewing and exerci&s;ing them him&s;elf. It has often been ob&s;erved, that the regiment of which he was &s;o many years lieutenant colonel, was one of the mo&s;t regu|lar and orderly regiments in the public &s;ervice; &s;o that per|haps none of our dragoons were more welcome than they, to the towns where their character was known. Yet no &s;uch bodies of men are &s;o blamele&s;s in their conduct, but &s;ome|thing will be found, e&s;pecially among &s;uch con&s;iderable num|bers, worthy of cen&s;ure, and &s;ometimes of puni&s;hment.

One in&s;tance of his conduct, which happened at Leice&s;ter, and was related by the per&s;on chiefly concerned to a worthy friend from whom I had it, I cannot forbear in|&s;erting.

The man afterwards appeared much a&s;hamed, and concerned for what he had done. But the colonel or|dered him to be brought early the next morning to his own quarters, where he had prepared a piquet, on which he ap|pointed him a private &s;ort of penance: And while he was put upon it, he di&s;cour&s;ed with him &s;eriou&s;ly and tenderly upon the evils and aggravations of his fault; admoni&s;hed him of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure which he had incurred; and ur|ged him to argue from the pain which he then felt, how in|finitely more dreadful it mu&s;t be, to fall into the hands of the living God, and indeed to meet the terrors of that dam|nation, which he had been accu&s;tomed impiou&s;ly to call for on him&s;elf and his companions. The re&s;ult of this proceed|ing was, that the offender accepted his puni&s;hment, not on|ly with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but with thankfulne&s;s. He went away with a more cordial affection for his colonel, than he eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had before; and &s;poke of it &s;ome years after to my friend, in &s;uch a manner, that there &s;eemed rea&s;on to hope, it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been in&s;trumental in producing, not only a change in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> life, but in his heart.</P>

Of the ju&s;tice of this te&s;timony which I had &s;o often heard from a variety of per&s;ons, I my&s;elf began to be a witne&s;s about the time when the la&s;t mentioned letter was dated. In this view I believe I &s;hall never forget that hap|py day, June 13, 1739, when I fir&s;t met him at Leice&s;ter, I remember, I happened that day to preach a lecture from P&s;al. cxix. 158. <Q>I beheld the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and was grieved, becau&s;e they kept not thy law.</Q> I was large in de&s;cribing that mixture of indignation and grief, (&s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed by the original word there,) with which the good man looks on the daring tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the divine law; and in tracing the cau&s;es of that grief, as ari&s;ing from a regard to the di|vine honour, and the intere&s;t of a Redeemer, and a compa&s;|&s;ionate concern for the mi&s;ery &s;uch offenders bring on them&s;elves, and for the mi&s;chief they do to the world about them. I little thought, how exactly I was drawing Colo|nel Gardiner's character under each of tho&s;e heads; and I have often reflected upon it as a happy providence, which opened a much &s;peedier way than I could have expected, to the brea&s;t of one of the mo&s;t amiable and u&s;eful friends, which I ever expect to find upon earth.

<P N="105">&sect;. 105. It might be a plea&s;ure to me, to make &s;everal extracts from many others of his letters: But it is a plea|&s;ure which I ought to &s;uppre&s;s and rather to reflect with unfeigned humility, how unworthy I was of &s;uch regards from &s;uch a per&s;on, and of that divine goodne&s;s which gave me &s;uch a friend in him. I &s;hall therefore only add two general remarks, which offer them&s;elves from &s;everal of his letters. The one is, that there is in &s;ome of them, as our freedom in|crea&s;ed an agreeable vein of humour and plea&s;antry; which &s;hews, how ea&s;y religion &s;at upon him, and how far he was from placing any part of it in a gloomy melancholy, or &s;tiff formality. The other is, that he frequently refers to dome&s;tic circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the illne&s;s or recovery of my children, &amp;c. which I am &s;urprized how a man of his ex|ten&s;ive and important bu&s;ine&s;s could &s;o di&s;tinctly bear upon his mind. But his memory was good, and his heart was yet better; and his friend&s;hip was &s;uch, that nothing which &s;en&s;ibly affected the heart of one whom he honoured with it, left his own but &s;lightly touched. I have all imaginable rea|&s;on to believe, that in many in&s;tances his prayers were not only offered for us in general terms, but varied as our par|ticular &s;ituation required. Many quotations might verify this; but I decline troubling the reader with an enumeration of pa&s;&s;ages, in which it was only the abundance of friendly &s;ympathy, that gave this truly great, as well as good man, &s;o cordial a concern.</P>

He, and all his &s;oldiers who cho&s;e to wor&s;hip with him, were gene|rally there, (as I have already hinted,) before the &s;ervice began; that the entrance of &s;o many of them at once might not di&s;turb the congregation already engaged in devotion, and that there might be the better opportunity for bringing the mind to a becoming attention, and preparing it for conver&s;e with the divine Being. While acts of wor&s;hip were going on, whether of prayer or &s;inging, he always &s;tood up; and whatever regard he might have for per&s;ons who pa&s;&s;ed by him at that time, though it were to come into the &s;ame pew, he never paid any compliment to them: And often has he expre&s;&s;ed his wonder at the indecorum, of breaking off our addre&s;s to God, to bow to a fellow creature; which he thought a much greater indecency, than it would be, on a like occa&s;ion and circum&s;tance, to interrupt an addre&s;s to our prince. During the time of preaching, his eye was com|monly fixed upon the mini&s;ter, though &s;ometimes turned round upon the auditory, where if he ob&s;erved any to trifle, it filled him with ju&s;t indignation. And I have known in|&s;tances, in which upon making the remark, he has commu|nicated it to &s;ome friend of the per&s;ons who were guilty of it, that proper application might be made to prevent it for the time to come.</P>

I cannot forbear relating a little &s;tory here which, when the Colonel him&s;elf heard it, gave him &s;uch exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, that I hope it will be acceptable to &s;everal of my readers. There was in a village, about three miles from Northampton, and in a family which of all others near me was afterwards mo&s;t indebted to him, (though he had ne|ver then &s;een any member of it,) an aged and poor, but e|minently good woman, who had with great difficulty, in the exerci&s;e of much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith and patience, diligence and humility, made &s;hift to educate a large family of children, after the death of her hu&s;band, without being chargeable to the pari&s;h; which, as it was quite beyond her hope, &s;he often &s;poke of with great delight. At length, when worn out with age and infirmities, &s;he lay upon her dying bed, &s;he did in a mo&s;t lively and affecting manner expre&s;s her hope and joy in the views of approaching glory. Yet amid&s;t all the tri|umph of &s;uch a pro&s;pect, there was one remaining care and di&s;tre&s;s which lay heavy on her mind; which was, that her journey and her &s;tock of provi&s;ions were both ended to|gether; &s;he feared, that &s;he mu&s;t either be buried at the pa|ri&s;h expence, or leave her mo&s;t dutiful and affectionate daughters the hou&s;e &s;tripped of &s;ome of the few moveables which remained in it, to perform the la&s;t office of duty to her, which &s;he had rea&s;on to believe they would do. While &s;he was combating with this only remaining anxiety. I happen|ed, though I knew not the extremity of her illne&s;s, to come it, and to bring with me a guinea, which the generous Co|lonel had &s;ent by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;age, on hearing the character of the family, for its relief. A pre&s;ent like this, (probably the mo&s;t con&s;iderable they had ever received in their lives,)

The Colonel's la&s;t re&s;idence at Northampton was in June and July, 1742, when Lord Cadogan's regiment of dragoons was quartered here: And I cannot but ob&s;erve that wherever that regiment came, it was remarkable not only for the fine appearance it made, and for the exactne&s;s with which it performed its various exerci&s;es (of which it had about this time the honor to receive the mo&s;t illu&s;trious te&s;timonials;) but al&s;o for the great &s;obriety and regularity of the &s;oldiers. Many of the officers copied after the ex|cellent pattern, which they had daily before their eyes; and a con&s;iderable number of the private men &s;eemed to be per|&s;ons, not only of &s;trict virtue, but of &s;erious piety. And I doubt not, but they found their abundant account in it; not only in the &s;erenity and happine&s;s of their own minds which is beyond compari&s;on the mo&s;t important con&s;ideration; but al&s;o in &s;ome degree, in the obliging and re&s;pectful treatment which they generally met with in their quarters. And I mention this, becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded that if gentlemen of their profe&s;&s;ion knew, and would reflect, how much more comfortable they make their own quarters by a &s;ober order|ly, and obliging conduct, they would be regular out of more &s;elf-love; if they were not influenced, as I heartily wi&s;h they may always be, by a nobler principle.</P>

I have now before me a letter dated from thence, October 16, 1742, in which he writes: <Q>As for me, I am indeed in a dry and barren land, where no water is, Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becau&s;e nothing is to be heard in our Sodom, but bla&s;pheming the name of my God; and I am not honoured as the in&s;trument of doing any great &s;ervice.

For whereas he had no intimation or expectation, of any thing more than a regiment of foot, his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed, out of his great goodne&s;s, to give
<PB N="88" REF="028578_0045_0FD97358500159E0">
him a regiment of dragoons, which was then quartered ju&s;t in his own neighbourhood. And it is properly remarked by the reverend and worthy per&s;on through who&s;e hand this let|ter was tran&s;mitted to me, that when the Colonel thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he could have no pro&s;pect of what he after|wards &s;o &s;oon obtained; as General Bland's regiment, to which he was advanced, was only vacant on the 19th of April, that is, two days before the date of this letter, when it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have any notice of that vacancy. And it al&s;o de&s;erves ob&s;ervation, that &s;ome few days after the Colonel was thus unexpectedly promoted to the command of the&s;e dragoons, Brigadier Cornwallis's regiment of foot, then in Flanders, became vacant: now had this happened before his promotion to General Bland's, Colonel Gardiner in all probability would only have had that regiment of foot, and &s;o have continued in Flanders. When the affair was i&s;&s;ued, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e informs lady Frances of it, in a letter dated from a vil|lage near Frankfort, May 3, in which he refers to his for|mer of the 21&s;t of April, ob&s;erving how remarkably it was verified, "in God's having given him," (for &s;o he ex|pre&s;&s;es it, agreeably to the views he continually maintained of the univer&s;al agency of divine Providence,) <Q>what he had no expectation of, and what was &s;o much better than that which he had mi&s;&s;ed, a regiment of dragoons quar|tered at his own door.</Q></P>

Accordingly, though he had other preferments offered him in the army, he cho&s;e to re|turn; and I believe, the more willingly, as he did not ex|pect there would have been any action. Ju&s;t at this time it plea&s;ed God to give him an awful in&s;tance of the uncertain|ty of human pro&s;pects and enjoyments, by that violent fever, which &s;eized him at Ghent in his way to England; and perhaps the more &s;everely, for the efforts he made to pu&s;h on his journey, though he had for &s;ome days been much in|di&s;po&s;ed. It was, I think, one of the fir&s;t fits of &s;evere ill|ne&s;s he had ever met with; and he was ready to look upon it, as a &s;udden call into eternity: But it gave him no pain|ful alarm in that view.

He arrived at North|ampton on Monday the 20th of June, and &s;pent part of three days here. But the great plea&s;ure which his return and preferment gave us, was much obated, by ob&s;erving his countenance &s;o &s;adly altered, and many marks of languor, and remaining di&s;order, which evidently appeared; &s;o that he really looked ten years older than he had done ten months before. I had however a &s;atisfaction, &s;ufficient to counter-balance much of the concern which this alteration gave me, in a renewed opportunity of ob&s;erving, indeed more &s;en&s;ibly than ever, in how remarkable a degree he was dead to the enjoyments and views of this mortal life. When I congra|tulated him on the favorable appearances of Providence for him in the late event, he briefly told me the remarkable circum&s;tances that attended it, with the mo&s;t g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e im+pre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to God for them; but added <Q>that as his account was increa&s;ed with his income, power, and influence, and his cares were proportionably increa&s;ed too, it was as to his own per&s;onal concern much the &s;ame to him, whether he had remained in his former &s;tation, or been elevated to this; but that if God &s;hould by this means honor him, as an in&s;trument of doing more good than he could otherwi&s;e have done, he &s;hould rejoice in it.</Q></P>

The evening before our la&s;t &s;eparation, as I knew I could not entertain the invaluable friend who was then my gue&s;t more agreeably, I preached a &s;ermon in my own hou&s;e, with &s;ome peculiar reference to his ca&s;e and circum&s;tances, from tho&s;e ever memorable words, than which I have never felt any more powerful and more comfortable: P&s;al. xci. 14, 15, 16. "Becau&s;e he hath &s;et his love upon me, there|fore will I deliver him; I will &s;et him on high, becau&s;e he hath known my name: He &s;hall call upon me, and I will an&s;wer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him: With long life (or length of days) will I &s;atisfy him, and &s;hew him my &s;alvation." This &s;crip|ture could not but lead our meditations to &s;urvey the character of the good man, as one who &s;o knows the name of the ble&s;&s;ed God, (has &s;uch a deep apprehen&s;ion of the glories and perfections of his nature,) as determinately to &s;et his love upon him, to make him the &s;upreme object of his mo&s;t ardent and con&s;tant affection. And it &s;ugge&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;ublime and animating hopes to per&s;ons of &s;uch a character; that their prayers &s;hall be always acceptable to God; that though they may, and mu&s;t be called out to their &s;hare in the troubles and calamities of life, yet they may a&s;&s;ure them|&s;elves of the divine pre&s;ence in all; which &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in their deliverance, in their exaltation, &s;ometimes, to di&s;tingui&s;hed honour and e&s;teem among men, and, it may be in a long cour&s;e of u&s;eful and happy years on earth; at lea&s;t, which &s;hall undoubtedly end in &s;eeing, to their perpetual delight, the complete &s;alvation of God, in a world where they &s;hall enjoy length of days for ever and ever, and employ them all in adoring the great author of their &s;alvation and felicity. It is evident, that the&s;e natural thoughts on &s;uch a &s;cripture were matters of univer&s;al concern. Yet had I known, that this was the la&s;t time I &s;hould ever addre&s;s Colonel Gardi|ner as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and had I fore&s;een the &s;cenes through which God was about to lead him, I hardly know what con&s;iderations I could have &s;ugge&s;ted with more peculiar propriety. The attention, elevation, and delight, with which he heard them, was very apparent; and the plea&s;ure which the ob&s;ervation of it gave me, continues to this moment. And let me be permitted to digre&s;s &s;o far, as to add, that this is indeed the great &s;upport of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, under the many di&s;couragements and di&s;appoint|ments

<P N="128">&sect;. 128. An incident occurs to my mind, which happen|ed that evening, which at lea&s;t for the oddne&s;s of it may de&s;erve a place in the&s;e memoirs. I had then with me one Thomas Porter, a poor, but very hone&s;t and religious man, (now living at Hatfield-Broadoak in E&s;&s;ex,) who is quite unacquainted with letters, &s;o as not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h one from another; yet is ma&s;ter of the contents of the bible in &s;o extraordinary a degree, that he has not only fixed an immen&s;e number of texts in his memory, but merely by hearing them quoted in &s;ermons has regi&s;tered there the chapter and ver&s;e, in which the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are to be found: This is attended with a marvellous facility in directing tho&s;e that can read, to turn to them, and a mo&s;t unaccountable talent of fixing on &s;uch, as &s;uit almo&s;t every imaginable variety of circum&s;tances in common life There are two con&s;iderations in his ca&s;e, which make it the more wonder|ful: The one, that he is a per&s;on of a very low genius, having, be&s;ides a &s;tammering which makes his &s;peech al|mo&s;t unintelligible to &s;trangers, &s;o wild and aukward a manner of behaviour that he is frequently taken for an idiot, and &s;eems in many things to be indeed &s;o: The other, that he grow up to manhood in a very licentious cour&s;e of living, and an entire ignorance of divine things, &s;o that all the&s;e exact impre&s;&s;ions on his memory have been made in his riper years. I thought it would not be di&s;agreeable to the Colonel, to introduce to him this odd phaaenomenon, which many hundreds of people have had a curio&s;ity to ex|amine:

And among all the &s;trange things I have &s;een in him, I never remember any which equalled what pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion. On hearing the colonel's profe&s;&s;ion, and re|ceiving &s;ome hints of his religious character, he ran through a va&s;t variety of &s;criptures, beginning at the Pentateuch and going on to the Revelation, relating either to the de|pendance to be fixed on God for the &s;ucce&s;s of military pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rations, or to the in&s;tances and promi&s;es occurring there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his care of good men in the mo&s;t eminent dangers, or to be encouragement to de&s;pi&s;e perils and death, while engaged in a good cau&s;e, and &s;upported by the views of a happy im|mortality. I believe, he quoted more than twenty of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages; and I mu&s;t freely own, that I know not who could have cho&s;e them with greater propriety. If my memory do not deceive me, the la&s;t of this catalogue was that from which I afterwards preached on the lamented occa&s;ion of this great man's fall: Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. We were all a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;o re|markable a fact; and I que&s;tion not, but that many of my readers will think the memory of it worthy of being thus pre&s;erved.</P>

But to return to my main &s;ubject: The next day after the &s;ermon and conver&s;ation of which I have been &s;peaking, I took my la&s;t leave of my ine&s;timable friend, af|ter attending him &s;ome part of his way northward. The fir&s;t &s;tage of our journey was to the cottage of that poor, but very religious family, which I had acca&s;ion to mention above, as relieved, and indeed in a great mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, by his charity. And nothing could be more delightful, than to ob|&s;erve the conde&s;cen&s;ion, with which he conver&s;ed with the&s;e his humble pen&s;ioners. We there put up our la&s;t united pray|ers together, and he afterwards expre&s;&s;ed, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms I ever heard him u&s;e on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, the &s;ingular plea&s;ure with which he had joined in them. Indeed it was no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me, to have an opportunity of recommend|ing &s;uch a valuable friend to the divine protection and ble&s;&s;ing, with that particular freedom, and enlargement on what was peculiar in his circum&s;tances, which hardly any other &s;itua|tion, unle&s;s we had been quite alone, could &s;o conveniently have admitted. We went from thence to the table of a per|&s;on of di&s;tinction in the neighbourhood; who&s;e he had an opportunity of &s;hewing, in how decent and graceful a man|ner
<PB N="94" REF="028578_0048_0FD9736D4AAC3D20">
he could unite the Chri&s;tian and the gentleman, and give conver&s;ation an improved and religious turn, without violat|ing any of the rules of polite behaviour, or &s;aying or doing any thing which looked at all con&s;trained or affected. Here we took our la&s;t embrace, committing each other to the care of the God of heaven; and the Colonel pur&s;ued his journey to the north, where he &s;pent all the remainder of his days.</P>

The more I reflect upon this appointment of pro|vidence, the more I di&s;cern of the beauty and wi&s;dom of it not only as it led directly to that glorious period of life, with which God had determined to honour him, and in which, I think, it becomes all his friends to rejoice; but al&s;o, as the retirement on which he entered could not but have a happy tendency to favour his more immediate and compleat prepa|ration for &s;o &s;peedy a remove. To which we may add, that it mu&s;t probably have a very powerful influence to promote the intere&s;ts of religion (incomparably the greate&s;t of all in|tere&s;ts) among the members of his own family; who mu&s;t &s;urely edify much by &s;uch daily le&s;&s;ons as they received from his lips, when they &s;aw them illu&s;trated and enforced by &s;o admirable an example, and this for two compleat years. It is the more remarkable, as I cannot find from the memoirs of his life in my hands, that he had ever been &s;o long at home &s;ince he had a family, or indeed, from his childhood, ever &s;o long at a time in any one place.</P>

His heart was &s;o habitually &s;et upon divine things, and he had &s;uch a permanent and overflowing &s;en&s;e of the love of Chri&s;t, that he could not forbear connecting &s;uch reflections, with a multitude of more di&s;tant occa&s;ions oc|curring in daily life, where le&s;s advanced chri&s;tians would not have thought of them: And thus, like our great ma&s;|ter, he made every little incident a &s;ource of devotion, and an in&s;trument of holy zeal.</P>

and de&s;igned to have &s;pent part of September at Northamp|ton. The expectation of this was mutually agreeable; but providence &s;aw fit to di&s;concert the &s;cheme. His love for his friends in the&s;e parts occa&s;ioned him, to expre&s;s &s;ome re|gret on his being commanded back: And I am pretty confi|dent, from the manner in which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in one of his la&s;t letters to me, that he had &s;ome more important rea|&s;ons for wi&s;hing an opportunity of making a London jour|ney ju&s;t at that cri&s;is; which, the reader will remember, was before the rebellion broke out.

It was in the ca&s;tle there, that his lady and elde&s;t daughter enjoyed the la&s;t happy hours of his company; and I think, it was about eight or ten days before his death, that he parted from them there. A remarkable circum&s;tance attended that parting, which hath been touched upon by &s;urviving friends in more then one of their letters to me. His lady was &s;o affected when &s;he took her la&s;t leave of him, that &s;he could not forbear bur&s;ting out into a flood of tears, with other marks of unu&s;ual emotion. And when he a&s;ked her the rea&s;on, &s;he urged the apprehen&s;ion &s;he had of lo&s;ing &s;uch an invaluable friend, amid&s;t the dangers to which he was then called out, as a very &s;ufficient apology. Upon which &s;he took particular notice, that whereas he had ge|nerally comforted her on &s;uch occa&s;ions, by pleading with

That heroic contempt of death which had of|ten di&s;covered it&s;elf in the mid&s;t of former dangers, was manife&s;ted now in his di&s;cour&s;e with &s;everal of his mo&s;t in|timate friends. I have re&s;erved for this place one genuine expre&s;&s;ion of it many years before, which I thought might be mentioned with &s;ome advantage here. In July, 1725, he had been &s;ent to &s;ome place, not far from Hamilton, to quell a mutiny among &s;ome of our troops. I know not the particular occa&s;ion; but I remember to have heard him men|tion it as &s;o fierce a one, that he &s;carce ever apprehended him&s;elf in a more hazardous circum&s;tance. Yet he quelled it, by his pre&s;ence alone, and the expo&s;tulations he u&s;ed; e|vidently putting his life into his hand to do it. The par|ticulars of the &s;tory &s;truck me much; but I do not &s;o exact|ly remember them, as to venture to relate them here. I on|ly ob&s;erve, that in a letter dated July 16, that year, which I have now before me, and which evidently refers to this event, he writes thus: <Q>I have been very bu&s;y, hurried about from place to place; but ble&s;&s;ed be God, all is over without blood&s;hed. And pray let me a&s;k, what made you &s;how &s;o much concern for me in your la&s;t? Were you afraid, I &s;hould get to heaven before you?

This appears in part from a letter which he wrote to the reverend Mr. Adams of Falkirk, ju&s;t as he was on marching from Stirling, which was only eight days before his death: "The rebels," &s;ays he, are <Q>advancing to cro&s;s the Firth; but I tru&s;t in the Almighty God, who doth what&s;oever he plea&s;es, in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth.</Q> And the &s;ame gentleman tells me, that a few days after the date of this, he marched through Falkirk with his regiment; and though he was then in &s;o langui&s;hing a &s;tate, that he needed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance as a &s;ecretary to write for &s;ome reinforcement, which might put it in his power to make a &s;tand, (as he was very de&s;irous to have done,) he expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t genu|ine and noble contempt of life, when to be expo&s;ed in the defence of a worthy cau&s;e.</P>

But ju&s;t as the words were out of his mouth, an Highland|er advanced towards him with a &s;cythe fa&s;tened to a long pole, with which he gave him &s;uch a deep wound on hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> right arm, that his &s;word dropped out of his hand; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame time &s;everal others coming about him, while he was thus dreadfully intangled with that cruel weapon, he was dragged off from his hor&s;e. The moment he fell, another Highlander, who, if the king's evidence at Carli&s;le may be credited, (as I know not why they &s;hould not, though the unhappy creature died denying it,) was one Mac-naught, who was executed about a year after, gave him a &s;troke, either with a broad-&s;word, or a Lochabar axe, (for my in|formant could not exactly di&s;tingui&s;h,) on the hinder part of his head, which was the mortal blow. All that his faith|ful attendant &s;aw farther at this time was, that as his hat was fallen off, he took it in his left hand, and waved it as a &s;ignal to him to retreat; and added, what were the la&s;t words he ever heard him &s;peak.

When I preached the &s;ermon, long &s;ince printed, on occa&s;ion of his death, I had great rea&s;on to believe, this report was true; though before the publication of it I began

to be in doubt: And on the whole, after the mo&s;t accurate enquiry I could po&s;&s;ibly make at this di&s;tance, I cannot get any convincing evidence of it. Yet I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that it does not appear impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;omething of this kind might indeed be uttered by him; as his &s;ervant te&s;ti|fies, that he &s;poke to him after receiving that fatal blow, which would &s;eem mo&s;t likely to have taken away the pow|er of &s;peech; and as it is certain, he lived &s;everal hours af|ter he fell. If therefore any thing of this kind did happen, it mu&s;t have been ju&s;t about this in&s;tant. But as to the &s;to|ry of his being taken pri&s;oner, and carried to the pretended prince, (who by the way afterwards rode his hor&s;e, and en|tered upon it into Derby) with &s;everal other circum&s;tances which were grafted upon that interview, there is the mo&s;t undoubted evidence of its fal&s;ehood. For his attendant men|tioned above, a&s;&s;ures me, that he him&s;elf immediately fled to a mill, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the &s;pot of ground on which the Colonel fell; where he changed his dre&s;s, and, di&s;gui&s;ed like a miller's &s;ervant, returned with a cart as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; which yet was not till near two hours after the engagement. The hurry of the action was then pretty well over, and he found his much honored ma&s;|ter, not only plundered of his watch and other things of va|lue, but al&s;o &s;tripped of his upper garments and boots; yet &s;till breathing: And adds, that though he were not capable of &s;peech, yet on taking him up he opened his eyes; which makes it &s;omething que&s;tionable, whether he were altoge|ther in&s;en&s;ible. In this condition, and in this manner, he conveyed him to the church of Tranent, from whence he was immediately taken into the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, and laid in bed, where he continued breathing, and frequently groan|ing, till about eleven in the forenoon; when he took his fi|nal leave of pain and &s;orrow, and undoubtedly ro&s;e to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed glories, which are re&s;erved for tho&s;e who have been &s;o eminently and remarkably faithful unto death.</P>

The cruelties, which the rebels, (as it is generally &s;aid, under the command of Lord Elcho) inflicted on &s;ome of the king's troops after they had a&s;ked quarter, are dreadfully legible on the countenan|ces of many who &s;urvived it.

The reflections I have made in my funeral &s;er|mon on my honoured friend, and in the dedication of it to his worthy and mo&s;t afflicted lady, &s;upercede many things which might otherwi&s;e have properly been added here. I conclude therefore, with humbly acknowledging the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of that awful providence, which drew &s;o thick a gloom around him in the la&s;t hours of his life, that the lu&s;tre of his virtues might dart through it with a more vivid and ob&s;ervable ray. It is abundant matter of thankfulne&s;s, that &s;o &s;ignal a monument of grace and ornament of the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, was rai&s;ed in our age and country, and &s;pared for &s;o many honourable and u&s;eful years. Nor can all the tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t affectionote friend&s;hip, while its &s;orrows bleed afre&s;h in the view of &s;o tragical a &s;cene, prevent my adoring the gracious appointment of the great Lord of all events, that when the day in which he mu&s;t have expired without an enemy appeared &s;o very near, the la&s;t ebb of his generous blood &s;hould be poured out, as a kind of &s;a|cred libation, to the liberties of his country, and the honour of his God; that all the other virtues of his character, em|balmed as it were by that precious &s;tream, might diffu&s;e a|round a more exten&s;ive fragrancy, and be tran&s;mitted to the mo&s;t remote po&s;terity with that peculiar charm, which they

<HEAD>APPENDIX. Relating to the COLONEL'S Per&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of &s;o many more important articles, I had really forgot to &s;ay any thing of the per&s;on of Colonel Gardiner, of which neverthele&s;s it may be proper here to add a word or two. It was, as I am informed, in younger life remarkably graceful and amiable: And I can ea&s;ily be|lieve it, from what I knew him to be, when our acquaint|ance began; though he was then turned of fifty, and had gone through &s;o many fatigues as well as dangers, which could not but leave &s;ome traces on his countenance. He was tall, (I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;omething more than &s;ix foot,) well proportioned, and &s;trongly built: His eyes of a dark grey, and not very large; his forehead pretty high; his no&s;e of a length and height no way remarkable, but very well &s;uit|ed to his other features; his cheeks not very prominent, his mouth moderately large, and his chin rather a little in|clining (when I knew him) to be peaked. He had a &s;trong voice, and lively accent; with an air very intriped, yet attempered with much gentlene&s;s: And there was &s;omething in his manner of addre&s;s mo&s;t perfectly ea&s;y and obliging, which was in a great mea&s;ure the re&s;ult of the great candor and benevolence, of his natural temper; and which, no doubt, was much improved by the deep humility which di|vine grace had wrought into his heart; as well as having been accu&s;tomed from his early youth, to the company of per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and polite behaviour.</P>
<P>The picture of him, was taken from an original done by Van Dee&s;t, (a Dutchman brought into Scotland by general Wade) in the year 1727, which was the 40th of his age;
<PB N="117" REF="028578_0059_0FD9738850813C28">
and is &s;aid to have been very like him then, though far from being an exact re&s;emblance of what he was when I had the happine&s;s of being acquainted with him. Perhaps he would have appeared to the greate&s;t advantage of all, could he have been exactly drawn on hor&s;eback; as many very good judges, and among the re&s;t the celebrated Mon&s;. Faubert him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave &s;poken of him as one of the compleate&s;t hor&s;emen that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as ever been known: And there was indeed &s;omething &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingularly graceful in his appearance in that attitude, that it was &s;ufficient (as what is very eminent in its kind gene|rally is,) to &s;trike an eye not formed on any critical rules.</P>

<P>SO animating a &s;ubject as the death of &s;uch a man, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, has occa&s;ioned a great deal of poe|try.

It may be more expedient to oblige my reader with the fol|lowing copy of ver&s;es, and an elegiack poem, compo&s;ed by two of my valuable friends who&s;e names are annexed.

<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY <HI>FRANCES GARDINER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE intimate knowledge I had of Colonel Gardiner's private as well as public character, and of that in|deared friend&s;hip which &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and your lady&s;hip, makes me more &s;en&s;ible than mo&s;t others can be, both of the inexpre&s;&s;ible lo&s;s you have &s;u&s;tained, and of the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e you have of it. I might, in &s;ome de|gree, argue what you felt from the agony with which my own heart was torn by that ever to be lamented &s;troke, which deprived the nation, and the church, of &s;o great an ornament and ble&s;&s;ing: And indeed, madam, I was &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of your calamity, as to be ready in my fir&s;t thoughts to congratulate you, when I heard the report which at fir&s;t pre|prevailed, that you died under the &s;hock. Yet cooler re|flections teaches me, on many accounts, to rejoice that your lady&s;hip has &s;urvived that deare&s;t part of your&s;elf; though after having been &s;o lovely and plea&s;ant in your lives, it would have been matter of per&s;onal rejoicing, in death not to have been divided. The numerous and promi&s;ing offspring with which God hath ble&s;&s;ed your marriage, had evidently the highe&s;t intere&s;t in the continued life of &s;o pious and affectionate a mother: And I hope, and a&s;&s;uredly be|lieve, there was a more important, and to you a much dear|er intere&s;t concerned, as God may be, and is &s;ignally ho|noured by the manner in which you bear this heavie&s;t and mo&s;t terrible &s;troke of his paternal rod.</P>
<P>God had been plea&s;ed, madam, to make you both emi|nent for a variety of graces; and he has proportionably di&s;|tingui&s;hed you both in the opportunity he has given you of
<PB N="138" REF="028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808">
exerci&s;ing tho&s;e, which &s;uit the mo&s;t painful &s;cenes, that can attend a pious and an honourable life. But when I con&s;ider, what it is, to have lo&s;t &s;uch a man, at &s;uch time, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances, I mu&s;t needs declare, that brave and heroic as the death of the colonel was, your lady&s;hip's part is beyond all compari&s;on the harde&s;t. Yet even here has the grace of Chri&s;t been &s;ufficient for you; and I join with your lady|&s;hip in adoring the power and faithfulne&s;s of him, who has here &s;o remarkably &s;hewn, that he forgets not his promi&s;e to all his people of a &s;trength proportionable to their days; that they may be enabled to glorify him in the hotte&s;t fur|nace, into which it is po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be ca&s;t.</P>
<P>To hear, (as I have heard from &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed character, who have lately had the happine&s;s of be|ing near your lady&s;hip,) of that meek re&s;ignation to the di|vine will, of that calm patience, of that chri&s;tian courage, with which, in &s;o weak a &s;tate of health and &s;pirits, you have &s;upported under this awful providence, has given me great plea&s;ure but no &s;urprize. So near a relation to &s;o brave a man might have taught &s;ome degree of fortitude, to a &s;oul le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of it than your lady&s;hip's, Nor is there any doubt, but that the prayers he has &s;o long been laying up in &s;tore for you, e&s;pecially &s;ince the decay of his con&s;titution gave him rea&s;on to expect a &s;peedy remove, will a&s;&s;uredly at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on come into remembrance before God. And above all, the &s;ublime principles of the chri&s;tian religion, &s;o deeply imbibed into your own heart as well as his, will not fail to exert their energy on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The&s;e, ma|dam, will teach you to view the hand of a wi&s;e, a righteous, and a gracious God in this event; and will &s;hew you, that a friend&s;hip founded on &s;uch a ba&s;is, &s;o very indearing, and &s;o clo&s;ely cemented, as that which has been here for many years a ble&s;&s;ing to you both, can know only a very &s;hort in|terruption, and will &s;oon grow up into a union infinitely no|bler and more delightful, which never &s;hall be liable to any &s;eparation.</P>
<P>In the mean time, madam, it may comfort us not a little under the &s;en&s;e of our pre&s;ent lo&s;s, to think what religious improvement we may gain by it, if we are not wanting to our&s;elves: And happy &s;hall we be indeed, if we &s;o hear the rod, as to receive the in&s;tructions it &s;o naturally &s;ugge&s;ts and in forces. Per&s;ons of any &s;erious reflection will learn from
<PB N="139" REF="028578_0070_0FD973BC906A7808">
this awful event, how little we can judge of the divine fa|vour by the vi&s;ible di&s;pen&s;ations of providence here: They will learn, (and it may be of great importance to con&s;ider it, ju&s;t in &s;uch a cri&s;is as this,) that no di&s;tingui&s;hed degree of piety can &s;ecure the very be&s;t of men from the &s;word of a common enemy: And they will &s;ee (written, alas, in cha|racters of the mo&s;t precious blood, that war ever &s;pilt in our i&s;land,) the vanity of the &s;ure&s;t protectors and comforters which mortality can afford, at a time when they are mo&s;t needed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are general in&s;tructions, which I hope thou&s;ands will receive, on this univer&s;ally lamented occa&s;ion: But to you, madam, and to me, and to all that were honoured with the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip of this chri&s;tian hero, his death has a peculiar voice. Whil&s;t it leads us back into &s;o many pa&s;t &s;cenes of delight, in the remembrance of which we now pour out our &s;ouls within us, it calls aloud, amid&s;t all this tender di&s;tre&s;s, for a tribute of humble thankfulne&s;s to God, that ever we enjoyed &s;uch a friend, and e&s;pecially in &s;uch an intimacy of mutual affection; and that we had an opportu|nity of ob&s;erving, in &s;o many in&s;tances, the &s;ecret re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">es of a heart, which God had enriched, adorned, and ennobled with &s;o much of his own image, and &s;uch abundant commu|nications of his grace: It calls for our redoubled diligence and re&s;olution, in imitating that bright a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, which &s;hone &s;o re&s;plendent in our illu&s;trious friend: And &s;urely it mu&s;t, by a kind of irre&s;i&s;tible influence mortify our affections to this impoveri&s;hed world; and mu&s;t cau&s;e na|ture to concur with grace, in rai&s;ing our hearts upwards to that glorious world, where he dwells triumphant and im|mortal, and waits our arrival with an ardor of pure and ele|vated love, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for death to quench.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e views, nothing can give your lady&s;hip greater &s;atisfaction, than to reflect, how happy you made the amiable con&s;ort you have lo&s;t, in that intimate relation you &s;o long bore to each other; in which, I well know, that growing years ripened and increa&s;ed your mutual e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. Nor will your generous heart be in&s;en&s;ible of that plea&s;ure, which may ari&s;e from reflecting, that the manner of his death (tho' in it&s;elf &s;o terrible, that we dare not tru&s;t imagination with the particular review,) was to him, in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, mo&s;t glorious to religion, high|ly
<PB N="140" REF="028578_0071_0FD973BD873DA728">
ornamental, and to his country (great as its lo&s;s is,) on various accounts beneficial. For very far be it from us to think, that Colonel Gardiner, tho' fallen by the wea|pons of rebellion and trea&s;on, has &s;ought and died in vain. I tru&s;t in God, that &s;o her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic a behaviour will in&s;pire our warriors with augmented courage, now they are called to exert it in a cau&s;e, the mo&s;t noble and important that can e|ver be in que&s;tion, the cau&s;e of our laws our liberty and religion&punc; I tru&s;t that all who keep up a corre&s;pondence with heaven by prayer, will renew their interce&s;&s;ion for this bleeding land with increa&s;ing fervour, now we have lo&s;t one who &s;tood in the breach with &s;uch unwearied im|portunity.

<P>&mdash;Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a glory peculiar to the Chri&s;tian religion, that it is capable of yielding joy and triumph to the mind, amid&s;t calamities, in which the &s;trength of nature, and of a philo|&s;ophy that has no higher a &s;upport, can hardly give it &s;ere|nity, or even patience. Tho&s;e boa&s;ted aids are but like a candle in &s;ome tempe&s;tuous night, which how artificially &s;o|ever it may be fenced in, is often extingui&s;hed amid&s;t the &s;torm, in which it &s;hould guide and chear the traveller, or the mariner, whom it leaves on a &s;udden, in darkne&s;s, hor|ror, and fear: while the con&s;olation of the go&s;pel, like the &s;un, makes a &s;ure day even when behind the thicke&s;t cloud, and &s;oon emerges from it with an acce&s;&s;ion of more &s;en&s;ible lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation is verified in the&s;e words, con&s;idered in connection with that awful providence, which has this day determined my thoughts to fix upon them, as the &s;ubject of my di&s;cour&s;e; the fall of that truly great and good man, Col. Gardiner: the endearing tenderne&s;s of who&s;e friend&s;hip would have rendered his death an un&s;peakable calamity to me, had his character been only of the common &s;tandard; as on the other hand, the exalted excellency of his character makes his death to be lamented by thou&s;ands who were not happy in any peculiar intimacy or per&s;onal acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>While we mourn the brave warrior, the exemplary Chri|&s;tian, and the affectionate friend; lo&s;t to our&s;elves and our country, to the church and the world, at a time when we mo&s;t needed all the defence of his bravery, all the edification of his example, all the comfort of his conver&s;e: &s;truck with the various and aggravated &s;orrow of &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o ter|rible a blow methinks there is but one voice that can chear us, which is this of the great Captain of our &s;alvation, &s;o lately addre&s;&s;ing him, and &s;till addre&s;&s;ing us, in the&s;e com|prehen&s;ive and animated words; "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="028578_0072_0FD963C7992A4A90">With regard to the connection of them, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that our Lord in all the&s;e &s;even epi&s;tles to the A&s;iatic churches repre&s;ents the Chri&s;tian life as a warfare, and the ble&s;&s;ings of the future &s;tate as rewards to be be&s;towed on conquerors. "To him that overcometh, will I give" &s;uch and &s;uch royal donatives. Pur&s;uing the &s;ame allegory, he warns the church of Smyrna of an approaching combat, which &s;hould be attended with &s;ome &s;evere circum&s;tances. Some of them were to become captives: "the devil &s;hall ca&s;t &s;ome of you into pri&s;on:" and though the power of the enemy was to be limited, in its extent as well as its dura|tion, to the tribulation of ten days, it &s;eems to be implied, that while many were harra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed during that time, &s;ome of them &s;hould before the clo&s;e of it be called to re&s;i&s;t unto blood. But their great Leader furni&s;hes them with &s;uitable armour, and proportionable courage, by this gracious a&s;&s;urance, which it is our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s farther to con|template: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."</P>
<P>In which words you naturally ob&s;erve a charge,&mdash;and a promi&s;e by which it is inforced&mdash;I &s;hall briefly illu&s;trate each, and then conclude with &s;ome reflections upon the whole.</P>
<P>FIRST, I am to open the charge here given: "Be thou faithful unto death."</P>

<P>I &s;hall not be large in explaining the nature of faithfulne&s;s in general; concerning which I might &s;hew you, that the word here rendered faithful has &s;ometimes a relation to the te&s;timony which God has given us, and &s;ometimes to &s;ome tru&s;t that he has repo&s;ed in us.

You well know this to be an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of our being acknowledged by him in the day of his final triumph: and of this he warned tho&s;e that gathered around him, when he was fir&s;t rai&s;ing his ar|my, under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages in outward appearance; expre&s;sly and plainly telling them, that they mu&s;t be content to follow him to martyrdom, to follow him to crucifixion, when they receive the word of command to do it; or that all their profe&s;&s;ion of regard to him would be in vain.

<P>And here I might ob&s;erve,&mdash;a Crown of Life is the glo|rious reward propo&s;ed,&mdash;and it is to be received from the hand of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Crown of Life is the reward propo&s;ed: which we are &s;ure in this connection implies, both grandeur, and felicity, here, though rarely connected together.</P>
<P>There is, no doubt, an allu&s;ion in the&s;e words, to the an|cient, and I think very prudent cu&s;tom, of animating the bravery of &s;oldiers by honorary rewards, and particularly by crowns, &s;ometimes of laurel, and &s;ometimes, more rarely, of &s;ilver or gold; which they were permitted to wear on public occa&s;ions, and in con&s;equence of receiving which they were &s;ometimes intitled to &s;ome peculiar immunities But here our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, con&s;cious of his own divine power and prerogative, &s;peaks with a dignity and elevation, which no earthly prince or commander could ever a&s;&s;ume; promi&s;ing a crown of life, and that (as was ob&s;erved before) even to

tho&s;e who &s;hould fall in the battle: A crown of life in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e; not only one, which &s;hould ever be fre&s;h and fair, but which &s;hould give immortality to the happy brow it adorned; and be for ever worn, not only as the monument of bravery and victory, but as the en&s;ign of royalty too: A crown connected with a kingdom, and with what no other kingdom can give, perpetual life to enjoy it; perpetual youth and vigour to reli&s;h all its delights. And this is a|greeable to the language of other &s;criptures, where we read of "the crown of life, which the Lord hath promi&s;ed to them that love him;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 12.</NOTE> a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 8.</NOTE> a crown of glory, which fadeth not away."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 4.</NOTE> We may al&s;o ob&s;erve,</P>

<P>This &s;ome pious commentators have explained, as intima|ting, that it is the gift of the Redeemer's free and unmerited grace, and not a retribution due to the merit of him that re|ceiveth it. And this is an undoubted truth, which it is of the highe&s;t importance to acknowledge and con&s;ider. The pro|per wages of &s;in, is death; but eternal life is (in oppo&s;ition to wages) "the gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE> We &s;hould humbly own it every day, that there is no proportion between the value of our &s;ervices, and the crown which we expect to receive: &s;hould own, that it is mercy that pardons our &s;ins, and grace that accepts our &s;er|vices; much more, that crowns them. Grace, grace, &s;hall (as it were) be engraven upon that crown, in characters large and indelible. Nor will that in&s;cription dimini&s;h its lu&s;tre, or impair the plea&s;ure with which we &s;hall receive it. I could not forbear mentioning this thought, as a truth of the utmo&s;t importance, which &s;tands on the firme&s;t ba&s;is of very many expre&s;s &s;criptures; a truth, of which perhaps no man living had ever a deeper &s;en&s;e, than our decea&s;ed friend. But I mention it thus obliquely, becau&s;e it may be doubted whether we can ju&s;tly argue it from hence; &s;ince the word give is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for rendering a retribution ju&s;tly due, and that in in&s;tances where grace and favour have, in pro|priety of &s;peech, no concern at all.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Compare Mat. xx. 8.

And the apo&s;tle Paul evidently refers to the &s;ame circum&s;tance, in terms which &s;hew how much he entered into the &s;pirit of the thought, when he &s;ays, "The Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give it me:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 8.</NOTE> He him&s;elf, the great Judge of the conte&s;t, who&s;e eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itne&s;&s;es the whole cour&s;e of it, who&s;e deci&s;ion cannot err, and from who&s;e &s;entence there is no appeal: Alluding to the judge who pre&s;ided in the Grecian games, who was always a per|&s;on of rank and eminence, and him&s;elf reached forth the reward to him who overcame in them.</P>
<P>So that on the whole, when our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life," methinks our devout meditations may expatiate up|on the words, in &s;ome &s;uch paraphra&s;e as this.

<P>Let us then think with reverence, and with joy, on the pious dead; and e&s;pecially on tho&s;e, whom God honoured with any &s;pecial opportunities of approving their fidelity, in life, or in death: And if we mourn, (as who in &s;ome circum|&s;tances, can forbear it?) Let it be as chri&s;tians, with that mixture of high congratulation, with that erect countenance, and that undaunted heart, which becomes tho&s;e that &s;ee by &s;aith their exaltation and felicity; and burning with a &s;trong and &s;acred eagerne&s;s to join their triumphant company, let us be ready to &s;hare in the mo&s;t painful of their trials, that we may al&s;o &s;hare in their glories.</P>

chri&s;tian hero, Colonel Gardiner; who&s;e character was too well known to many of you, by &s;ome months re&s;idence here, to need your being informed of it from me; and who&s;e hi&s;tory was too remarkable, to be confined with|in tho&s;e few remaining moments, which mu&s;t be allotted to the fini&s;hing of this di&s;cour&s;e. Yet there was &s;omething &s;o uncommon in both, that I think it of high importance to the honor of the go&s;pel and grace of Chri&s;t, that they &s;hould be delivered down to po&s;terity, in a di&s;tinct and particular view. And therefore, as the Providence of God, in concurrence with that mo&s;t intimate and familiar friend&s;hip with which this great and good man was plea&s;ed to honor me gives me an opportunity of &s;peaking of many important things, e&s;pe|cially relating to his religious experiences, with greater ex|actne&s;s and certainty than mo&s;t others might be capable of doing; and as he gave me his full permi&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e I &s;hould have the affliction to &s;urvive him, to declare freely whate|ver I knew of him, which I might apprehend conducive to the glory of God, and the advancement of religion: I pur|po&s;e publi&s;hing, in a di&s;tinct tract, &s;ome remarkable pa&s;&s;a|ges of his life, illu&s;trated by extracts from his own letters, which &s;peak in the mo&s;t forcible manner the genuine &s;enti|ments of his heart. But as I promi&s;e my&s;elf con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this work, from &s;ome valuable per&s;ons in the northern part of our i&s;land, and po&s;&s;ibly from &s;ome of his own papers, to which our pre&s;ent confu&s;ions forbid my ac|ce&s;s, I mu&s;t delay the execution of this de&s;ign at lea&s;t for a few months; and mu&s;t likewi&s;e take heed, that I do not too much anticipate what I may then offer to the public view, by what it might otherwi&s;e be very proper to mention now.</P>
<P>Let it therefore &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent to remind you, that Colonel Gardiner was one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious in&s;tances of the energy, and indeed I mu&s;t al&s;o add of the &s;overeignty of divine grace, which I have heard or read of in modern hi&s;tory. He was, in the mo&s;t amazing and miraculous man|ner, without any divine ordinance, without any religious opportunity, or peculiar advantage, deliverance, or affliction, reclaimed on a &s;udden, in the vigour of life and health, from the mo&s;t licencious and abandoned &s;en&s;uality, not only to a &s;teady cour&s;e of regularity and virtue, but to high devotion, and &s;trict though unaffected &s;anctity of manners: A cour&s;e, (in which he per&s;i&s;ted for more than twenty-&s;ix years, that

is, to the clo&s;e of life,) &s;o remarkably eminent for piety to|wards God, diffu&s;ive humanity and Chri&s;tian charity, lively faith, deep humility, &s;trict temperance, active diligence in improving time, meek re&s;ignation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the will of God, &s;teady patience in enduring afflictions, unaffected contempt of &s;ecu|lar intere&s;t and re&s;olute and couragious zeal in maintaining truth, as well as in reproving and (where his authority might take place) re&s;training vice and wickedne&s;s of every kind; that I mu&s;t deliberately declare, that when I con&s;ider all the&s;e particulars together, it is hard to &s;ay where, but in the book of God, he found his example, or where he has left his e|qual. Every one of the&s;e articles, with many more, I hope, (if God &s;pare my life) to have an opportunity of illu&s;trating, in &s;uch a manner as to &s;hew, that he was a living demon|&s;tration of the energy and excellency of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion; nor can I imagine how I can &s;erve its intere&s;ts bet|ter, than by recording what I have &s;een and known upon this head, known to my own edification, as well as my joy.</P>
<P>But, Oh, how &s;hall I lead back your thoughts, and my own, to what we once enjoyed in him, without too deep and tender a &s;en&s;e of what we have lo&s;t! To have poured out his &s;oul in blood; to have fallen by the &s;avage and rebellious hands of his own countrymen, at the wall of his own hou&s;e; de&s;erted by tho&s;e, who were under the highe&s;t obligations that can be imagined to have defended his life with their own; and above all, to have &s;een with his dying eyes the e|nemies of our religion and liberties triumphant, and to have heard in his late&s;t moments the horrid noi&s;e of their in&s;ulting &s;houts;&mdash;is a &s;cene, in the view of which we are almo&s;t tempted to &s;ay, Where were the &s;hields of angels? Where the eye of Providence? Where the remembrance of tho&s;e numberle&s;s prayers, which had been offered to God for the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a man, at &s;uch a time as this?&mdash;But let faith a&s;&s;ure us, that he was never more dear and preci|ous in the eye of his divine leader, than in the&s;e dreadful moments, when if &s;en&s;e were to judge, he might &s;eem mo&s;t neglected. That is of all others the happie&s;t death, which may mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly approve our fidelity to God, and our zeal for his glory. To &s;tand &s;ingly in the combat with the fierce&s;t enemies, in the cau&s;e of religion and liberty, when the whole regiment he commanded fled; to throw him&s;elf with &s;o noble an ardor to defend tho&s;e on foot, whom the

whole body which he headed were appointed to &s;upport, when he &s;aw that the fall of the neare&s;t commander expo&s;ed tho&s;e brave men to the extremity of danger; were circum|&s;tances that evidently &s;hewed, how much be held honour and duty dearer than life. He could not but be con&s;cious of the di&s;tingui&s;hed profe&s;&s;ion he had made, under a religious character; he could not but be &s;en&s;ible, how much our ar|my, in circum&s;tances like the&s;e, needs all that the mo&s;t ge|nerous examples can do, to animate its officers and its &s;ol|diers: And therefore he &s;eems deliberately to have judged, that although when his men would hear no voice but that of their fears, he might have retreated without infamy, it was better he &s;hould die in &s;o glorious a cau&s;e, than have it thought that his regard to religion and liberty was but a mere profe&s;&s;ion, that was not &s;trong enough to make him faithful unto death. He had long felt the force of it; and had too high a value for his king and country, to think of de&s;erting the tru&s;t committed to him; too great a love for the prote&s;tant religion, to think of exchanging it for the errors of popery; and rather than give way to a rebellious crew, by who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s an inlet would be opened to the cruel ravages of arbitrary power, and to the bloody and relentle&s;s rage of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, he loved not his life unto the death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 11.</NOTE>. And in this view his death was martyrdom, and has, I doubt not, received the applau&s;es and rewards of it: For what is martyrdom, but voluntarily to meet death, for the honour of God, and the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience? &mdash;And if it be indeed true, as it is reported on very con&s;iderable authority, that before he expired he had an in|terview with the leader of the oppo&s;ite party, and declared in his pre&s;ence <Q>the full a&s;&s;urance he had of an immortal crown, which he was going to receive,</Q> it is a circum|&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce worthy of being had in everla&s;ting remembrance: As in that ca&s;e, providence may &s;eem wonderfully to have united two &s;eemingly incon&s;i&s;tent circum&s;tances, in the manner of his dying; the alternative of either of which he has &s;poken of in my hearing, as what with humble &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the great Lord of life he could mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h: "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at if be were not called directly to die for the truth," which he rightly judged the mo&s;t glorious and happy lot of mortality, <Q>he might either fall in the field of battle,

fighting in defence of the religion and liberties of his country; or might have an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his hopes and joys, as a chri&s;tian to the honour of his Lord, and the edification of tho&s;e about him, in his departing moments; and &s;o might go off this earthly &s;tage,</Q> as in the letter that relates his death, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid that he did, "triumphing in the a&s;&s;urance of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality."</P>
<P>How difficult it mu&s;t be in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to gain certain and exact information, you will ea&s;ily perceive: But enough is known, and more than enough, to &s;hew how ju&s;tly the high con&s;olations of that glorious &s;ubject which we have been contemplating, may be applied to the pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion. From what is certain with relation to him, we may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that after he had adorned the go&s;pel by &s;o honorable a life, in &s;uch a con&s;picuous &s;ta|tion, God &s;eems to have conde&s;cended, as with his own hand, to rai&s;e him an illu&s;trious theatre, on which he might die a venerable and amiable &s;pectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 9.</NOTE>; ballancing to his native land by &s;uch an exit, the lo&s;s of what future &s;ervices it could have ex|pected, from a con&s;titution &s;o much broken as his was, by the fatigues of his campaign in Flanders, where he con|tracted an illne&s;s, from which he never recovered.</P>
<P>On the whole therefore, whatever cau&s;e we have, (as in|deed we have great cau&s;e,) to &s;ympathize with his wounded family, and with his wounded country; and how decent &s;o|ever it may be, like David, to take up our lamentation over the mighty fallen, and the brighte&s;t weapons of our war peri&s;hed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. i. 27.</NOTE>; (and oh, how naturally might &s;ome of us adopt the preceding words too!) Yet after all, let us en|deavour to &s;ummon up a &s;pirit, like that with which he bore the lo&s;s of friends, eminent for their goodne&s;s and u&s;efulne&s;s. And while we glorify God in him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 24.</NOTE>, as on &s;o many accounts we have rea&s;on to do, let us be animated by &s;uch an example to a re&s;olution of continuing like him, &s;tedfa&s;t in our duty, amid&s;t de&s;ertion and danger, and all the terrors that can be&s;et us around. As he, having been &s;o eminently faithful unto death, has undoubtedly received a crown of life, which &s;hines with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;ture, among tho&s;e who are come out of much tribulation<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev. vii. 14.</NOTE>; let us be couragious followers of him, and of all the glorious com|pany
