All that I have aim'd at has been to give a regular Form, and more decent Dre&s;s to tho&s;e Sentiments which are every Day &s;ported by our Coffee-Hou&s;e Politicians. It can do a good Cau&s;e no Harm to &s;tate the &s;ame Facts in a dif|ferent Light, and dre&s;s the &s;ame Sentiments in different Language.

<P>_THE Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, in its pre&s;ent State, may be con&s;ider'd as a nice Piece of Machinery, which has undergone many Changes and Alterations.

What State of Per|fection it may, at this Period, have obtain'd, I leave to be determin'd by tho&s;e, who have Talents better adapted, and Opportunities more favourable for &s;uch Kind of Speculation. I only mean to take Notice of a few Par|ticulars which may &s;erve to regulate my Sentiments
<PB N="2" REF="010273_0004_0F7E48CCD48BC7E8">upon the pre&s;ent important Di&s;pute between Great Britain and it's Colonies.</P>
<P>The Spirit of the Engli&s;h Nation, depre&s;s'd and broken by the Norman Conque&s;t, for many Years quietly gave Way to the Rage of De&s;poti&s;m; and peaceably &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t abject Va&s;&s;allage. I do not mean to in&s;inuate that before that Period, They ever enjoy'd a State of Liberty. The frequent Irrup|tions of the Danes and Saxons kept Them in a State of con&s;tant Confu&s;ion. Each little, temporary Kingdom govern'd by a particular Policy of it's own, had it's Attention too much engag'd by it's encroaching Neigh|bours, to refine much upon the &s;imple&s;t Principles of Government. But, when the Norman, at one Stroke, &s;ubdued all South-Britain, the Weight of his Sword induc'd a general Acquie&s;cence to the mo&s;t ar|bitrary Mea&s;ures. Disjointed as the Kingdom had been, by the Intru&s;ion of foreign Powers, and indeed peopled by different Nations; a very con&s;iderable Time was re|quir'd to produce a perfect Coalition. No &s;ooner was this natural Effect produc'd, and the Nation become one family united Body, connected by the &s;ame Ties and engag'd in the &s;ame Intere&s;t, but the &s;uperior and more &s;en&s;ible Part, &s;hew'd it's Aver&s;ion to the Tyranny of the Norman Princes, by the bolde&s;t Oppo&s;ition; and laid the Foundation of our pre&s;ent Liberty.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Stages of feudal Government, the common People were reduced to &s;uch a State of abject Slavery, that the Voice of Liberty could not ea&s;ily reach their Ears. The Batons fir&s;t felt the Weight of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and, by a &s;pirited Oppo&s;ition, endeavour'd to reduce within rea&s;onable Bounds, the almo&s;t unlimitted Authority of
<PB N="3" REF="010273_0004_0F7E48CCD48BC7E8">the Crown. At this happy Period, We may fix the Foundation of Engli&s;h Liberty. The common People, employ'd by their Lords, to effect their glorious Pur|po&s;es, grew every Day more intelligent. As They became acquainted with and intere&s;ted in Facts, They naturally acquir'd &s;uch a Habit of rea&s;oning upon Them, as &s;oon &s;erv'd to &s;hew Them that nothing but Re&s;olution was requir'd to obtain a rea&s;onable Share of Freedom. Once acquainted with their own Importance, They never &s;top'd 'till They had &s;ecur'd the mo&s;t valu|able of tho&s;e Privileges which are now &s;aid to be the Birth-Right of Engli&s;hmen. They obtain'd the ample&s;t Charter as a Security again&s;t the Encroachments of the Crown, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd for them&s;elves an equitable In|tere&s;t in the Power of Legi&s;lation. The Prerogative of the King became limitted by the &s;ame Law, which &s;ecur'd the Liberty and Property of the Subject; and the more effectually to maintain their invaluable Ac|qui&s;itions, every County, City and Borough was to choo&s;e a certain Number of its Members to &s;it in a general A&s;&s;embly for the propounding and enacting, in Conjunction with the Barons, &s;uch Laws as future Occa&s;ions might demand. The Kingdom thus divided into the three E&s;tates of the King, Lords and Com|mons; the Policy of it's Government became every Day more refin'd and delicate. The People thus rais'd to &s;uch a Degree of Importance, and jealous of their new acquir'd Rights, have, from Day to Day, for Ages pa&s;t, &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;puted, with the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, every Point which might &s;erve to confirm this happy E&s;tabli&s;hment. While the Nation knew no Law but the Sovereign's Will, continual Di&s;&s;atisfaction
<PB N="4" REF="010273_0005_0F7E48CD48D6A260">and violent Oppo&s;ition kept alive the Spirit of Di&s;cord: But, when the Law of the Land was confirm'd by the Voice of every Freeman properly repre&s;ented, it's Exe|cution was enforc'd by the united Power of the whole; &s;ince no Man could be depriv'd of Life, Liberty or Property, but by tho&s;e Statutes which He him&s;elf had fram'd.</P>
<P>In this Situation of almo&s;t perfect Security, the new World was di&s;cover'd, and the Inhabitants of Great Britain, tempted by extraordinary Conce&s;&s;ions from the Crown, and a Hope of future Advantage to Them|&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, left their native Country, to &s;ettle and cultivate a De&s;art. They were not bani&s;h'd to America as a Puni&s;hment for any Crimes which They had committed, and by which They might po&s;&s;i|bly have forfeited the Privileges of Society. Far from it! &mdash; They left England as free Adventurers; and, bringing with Them the Obligation of Allegiance to their lawful Sovereign, brought with Them all the Rights of Engli&s;hmen. As They could not by any Act of their's di&s;pence with the One, &s;o could They not relinqui&s;h the Other to the Prejudice of their Po&s;|terity. The fir&s;t Settlements were made under the Direction of the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, and to &s;ome were given particular<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among the &s;everal Colonies who&s;e Form of Government is &s;ettled by particular Charters, I am led to take Notice of that happy Con&s;ti|tution e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Province of Penn&s;ylvania, from &s;ome very ex|traordinary Mea&s;ures lately &s;et on Foot to effect a Change of Govern|ment. The Form which at pre&s;ent prevails, was granted by the Pro|prietor in the Charter of 1701 to the Petition of it's Inhabitants can|celling the original Charter, which had obtain'd the Approbation of the greate&s;t Politicians, merely to gratify their capricious Wi&s;hes. Enrich'd with &s;uch immen&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and ve&s;ted with &s;uch exten&s;ive Powers as almo&s;t put Him upon a Footing with a Prince of the Empire, Mr. Penn, in every Tran&s;action, not only evidenc'd the greate&s;t Ex|tent of Genius, but the mo&s;t obliging Conde&s;cen&s;ion to the fluctuating Humours of his fir&s;t Adventurers.
<P>From this new Grant They receiv'd &s;uch extraordinary Privileges, as &s;ecur'd Them the Enjoyment of more than <HI>Engli&s;h Liberty.</HI> Their A&s;&s;embly of Repre&s;entatives, annually cho&s;en by Ballot, have the pe|culiar Privilege of &s;etting upon their own Adjournment, and an ab&s;olute Power to di&s;po&s;e of the public Monies in what manner They plea&s;e. Unmindful of all the&s;e &s;ingular Advantages, and blind to their own Intere&s;ts, They have &s;uffer'd an ill founded Re&s;entment again&s;t their Proprietor, encourag'd by the artful Management of one de&s;igning Man, to hurry Them into &s;uch a Mea&s;ure, as They may here|after have Lei&s;ure to repent. To acquire a Power of throwing upon their Proprietary what They conceive to be his exact Proportion of the public Burthen. &mdash; to extort from the Man who is the Object of their implacable Hatred, perhaps an Addition of &pound;500 per. Annum to the public Funds, They would willingly re&s;ign to the Mini&s;ters of the Crown the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of the whole; and to effect the malicious Purpo&s;es of a few &s;plenetic Individuals, They would &s;acrifice the Intere&s;ts and Happine&s;s of the whole Community. Hi&s;|tory cannot furni&s;h Us with a more amazing In&s;tance of blind Infatu|ation; nor could any Man, with le&s;s Abilities than Mr. F&mdash;n po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, have led a whole Province blindfold to De&s;truction.</P></NOTE> Charters of Privileges. The highe&s;t Encouragement which They receiv'd, &s;carcely
<PB N="9" REF="010273_0005_0F7E48CD48D6A260">under their Situation tolerable; or but poorly recom|pens'd the Inconveniences which They &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>In the Infancy of their Settlement, before any cri|tical Occa&s;ion, requir'd more particular Regulations, They had the Common and Statute Law of England for their Guide: But, when their Labours had rais'd Them to con&s;iderable Importance, and the Emergency of Circum&s;tances requir'd it, They were allow'd to form different A&s;&s;emblies of &s;elect Men, as Repre&s;en|tatives of the Freemen of the different Settlements. The Crown had it's Deputy at the Head of each Colony,
<PB N="10" REF="010273_0006_0F7E48CDE06A9968">with a con&s;iderable Number of it's cho&s;en Servants to form a Third E&s;tate, ve&s;ted with the Powers and Pri|vileges of the Lords. Thus were the Intere&s;ts of the Crown mo&s;t effectually &s;ecur'd by this double Repre|&s;entation in the two &s;uperior Branches of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>As the fir&s;t Settlement of the Colonies was not a Matter of national Concern; the whole fell under the Direction of the Mini&s;ters of the Crown; and in their In|fant State, all their little Di&s;putes, too crude and undi|ge&s;ted to come regularly before any of the &s;uperior Courts of Judicature, were brought before the Privy Council for a final Determination. The Conveniency of this Method of Proceeding, render'd it agreeable to the Coloni&s;ts; who did not conceive all the Evils which it might po&s;&s;ibly produce: And thus did the Privy Council u&s;urp a Juri&s;diction altogether uncon&s;titutional. The laborious Inhabitants of the&s;e Settlements, had their Attention too much employ'd by their nece&s;&s;ary Avocations, to examine much into the Minutiae of Government. A Form, in any Degree re&s;embling that of their Mother Country, &s;atisfi'd their moderate Wi&s;hes; and, while They were encourag'd in their Pur&s;uit of pre&s;ent Gain, They &s;uffer'd Them&s;elves to be altogether directed by the Mini&s;ters of the Crown. To pre&s;erve an Appearance of Liberty, each little So|ciety was allow'd to choo&s;e a rea&s;onable Number of it's Members, to meet in a general A&s;&s;embly, for the propounding &s;uch Laws as the State of the Colony might require; but, before any &s;uch Act as might be propos'd by the repre&s;entative Body of Free|men, could obtain the Force of Laws, They mu&s;t receive the Approbation both of the Governor and
<PB N="11" REF="010273_0006_0F7E48CDE06A9968">Council; and even after all this, be laid before the Privy Council for a final Confirmation or Repeal. Di&s;advantageous as this Form mu&s;t appear to every un|prejudic'd Per&s;on, to highly were the Coloni&s;ts affected with a Sen&s;e of Duty for their Sovereign, that They never attempted to di&s;pute the Legality of that Con|&s;titution which had been &s;ettled by his Mini&s;ters. They patiently &s;ubmitted to many Inconveniencies, rather than di&s;turb the publick Peace by a Remon&s;trance of Grie|vances. Their Trade not yet oppre&s;t by unrea&s;onable Re&s;trictions, They chearfully exerted their utmo&s;t In|du&s;try to promote the Intere&s;t of Great-Britain. The Produce of each different Colony was exported to foreign Markets, to enable the Exporters to pay punctu|ally for the immen&s;e Quantity of Briti&s;h Manufac|tures which They yearly con&s;um'd. In the Cour&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful Commerce They even &s;ubmitted, without Murmuring, to Regulations fram'd by the Briti&s;h Par|liment; and &s;uffer'd the Expediency of the Mea&s;ure, to prevent their examining into it's Legality. Indeed all &s;uch general Regulations as could not be effected by the &s;ingle Powers of any one Colony, were willingly receiv'd from the Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain; from a Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e Advantages which They brought to the whole united Body: But, when that &s;ame Legi&s;lature, unmindful of tho&s;e very Principles from which They fir&s;t deriv'd their Power, have at|tempted to bind the Colonies by the mo&s;t injurious op|pre&s;&s;ive Act, They have met with an Oppo&s;ition which They never could have expected; and that too from a Spirit, which Nothing but the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e could have excited. Warm'd with a Sen&s;e of Re&s;ent|ment
<PB N="12" REF="010273_0007_0F7E48D1173EAF00">for the pre&s;ent Attempt, They naturally extend their Enquiries to what is, <HI>or ought</HI> to be the Con|&s;titution of the Colonies, agreeable to the Plan e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd by their Forefathers. No Man will deny that the provincial Americans have an inherent, <HI>unalienable Right</HI> to all the Privileges of Briti&s;h Subjects. This Po&s;ition taken for granted, let Us now &s;ee how careful our Kind Parent has been to pre&s;erve from Violation tho&s;e &s;acred Privileges. Let Us take a Review of that Form which generally prevails where the Con&s;titution has not been &s;ettled by particular Charters; and, by comparing this with the Form, which, at this happy Period, is e&s;tabli&s;h'd in Great-Britain, We &s;hall ea&s;ily determine whether the Colonies enjoy the Rights and Privileges of their Mother Country. The Freemen of each Province are duly repre&s;ented in an A&s;&s;embly form'd upon the &s;ame Principles as the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; but then the Crown is doubly repre&s;ented, by no|minating both the Governor and Council. The Council, generally cho&s;en from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of of the Province, become the middle Branch of the Legi&s;lature, and are ve&s;ted with the Powers and Pri|vileges of the Lords. Proud of the Dignity annext to their Office, and fond of maintaining &s;uch a flatter|ing Superiority. They naturally become Tools<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The honourable Members of the Council, for the Province of New York, in a late very intere&s;ting Debate, have prov'd that this general Maxim, tho' &s;upported both by Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervation, is not unexceptionable.</NOTE> of that Mini&s;try, upon who&s;e Favour their very Exi&s;tence de|pends; &s;ince, the &s;ame Power which rais'd Them to this exalted Rank, can, for a &s;ingle Act of Di&s;obedience,
<PB N="13" REF="010273_0007_0F7E48D1173EAF00">&s;ink Them into their original Ob&s;curity. The Crea|tion of &s;o powerful a Part of the Con&s;titution, depend|ing altogether upon the royal Mandate, is not the only Grievance. The Coun&s;ellors are generally taken from among the mo&s;t wealthy and important, and the Society thus lo&s;es the Weight and Influence of it's mo&s;t valuable Members. The Lords indeed are of the &s;ame Creation; but, once created, cannot be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their Rank; and naturally form a Body &s;o re&s;pectable and independent, that They are with great Propriety and Safety tru&s;ted with the Liberty and Property of the Nation. Far different is the Nature and Con&s;titu|tion of a Provincial Council! As a Branch of the Legi&s;|lature, They can only be con&s;ider'd as Creatures of the Crown; and, when &s;itting as a Court of Judicature, no more than Judges during Plea&s;ure. With Officers &s;o totally under the Influence of the Crown, how can the Subject confide the mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;&s;ings of Life? or how can They weakly think their Liberty and Pro|perty &s;ufficiently &s;ecure, when We mu&s;t rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the Judge who is to determine upon both, dare not give a Determination, incon&s;i&s;tent with that royal Plea&s;ure by which He holds his Commi&s;&s;ion. The Prerogative of the Crown thus carefully guarded, in a Manner incon&s;i&s;tent with the Liberty of the Sub|ject, and unwarranted by the Principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution; the Mini&s;ters of the Crown are &s;till de|termin'd to effect one favourite Purpo&s;e, which They may hereafter make U&s;e of for the Introduction and Support of the mo&s;t arbitrary and tyrannical Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>By one &s;ingle Stroke of political Legerdemain, They have unhing'd the whole Con&s;titution. It was not
<PB N="14" REF="010273_0008_0F7E48D2A71AF0C8">&s;ufficient to have our Judges moulded by the Hand of Power. The darling Privilege, of Juries, &s;till remain'd as a formidable Support of Liberty. At once to de|pretiate the&s;e Jewels of Engli&s;h Freedom, and reduce Us to a State of abject Dependence, the privy Council have erected them&s;elves into a Court of final Appeal. &mdash; of Appeal upon the <HI>Merits of the Cau&s;e.</HI> A Mea|&s;ure &s;o fraught with pernicious Con&s;equences, and &s;o incompatible with the Spirit of Freedom, that it cou'd owe it's Birth to Nothing but the horrid De&s;ign of re|ducing the Colonies to an abject State of Va&s;&s;allage. No Mini&s;ter of the Crown, tho' ever &s;o warm in the Pur&s;uit of this dete&s;table Purpo&s;e, dare think of effect|ing it &s;o precipitately, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Power which ought to be the Guardian of Engli&s;h Liberty. How this has been obtain'd one cannot ea&s;ily imagine, unle&s;s it has been by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of our Conduct, and by exciting &s;uch a ridicu|lous Jealou&s;y, as mu&s;t, upon the &s;lighte&s;t Examination, appear to be as unnatural as it is ill founded. That the Enemies to America have drawn upon Us all the Weight of Parliamentary Power, was clearly evidenc'd by the &s;evere Re&s;trictions upon Trade, before the pre|&s;ent infamous Act for collecting a Stamp Duty gave the Alarm to the Sons of Freedom. What may be the Con&s;equence of the &s;pirited Oppo&s;ition which has been given to this daring Act of Oppre&s;&s;ion, Time only can determine: But, whether we may obtain the invaluable Birth-right for which We now di&s;pute, or whether We may fall a Sacrifice to &s;uperior Power, We &s;hall have the Satisfaction of thinking that We have di&s;charg'd our Duty to Our&s;elves and Po&s;terity; and every Heart
<PB N="15" REF="010273_0008_0F7E48D2A71AF0C8">dead to the Sen&s;e of Freedom mu&s;t feel the Ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e.</P>

They very rea&s;onably imagine Them&s;elves entitled to the Benefits, and obnoxious to the Penalties both of the common and Statute Law, as it was e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd at the Time when their Ance&s;tors quitted their native Country; &s;ince the Coloni&s;ts of the pro&s;ent Age claim, by Right of Inheritance, as great an Intere&s;t in the Settlement of tho&s;e Laws; as the pre&s;ent Inha|bitants of Great-Britain: But who will venture, upon the common Principles of Rea&s;on, to a&s;&s;ert, that the Freemen of Great-Britain can ve&s;t their Repre&s;entatives with the Power, arbitrarily to di&s;po&s;e of the Property of their American Brethren?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010273_0010_0F7E48D3EE0301C8">
We are told that the Coloni&s;ts have no more Rea&s;on to complain of being bound by Laws to which They have not &s;ub&s;crib'd by their Repre&s;entatives, than tho&s;e flouri&s;hing Towns in England, which &s;end no Members to Parliament.

If there be any Meaning at all in the Doctrine of Repre&s;entation, We cannot &s;uppo&s;e it to be ab&s;urdly partial&mdash;calculated to pro|cure the mo&s;t invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings of Life for one par|ticular Part of Society, and, at the &s;ame Time leave the other at the Mercy of unlimitted Power.</P>
<P>When this important Privilege was granted to the Freemen of Great-Britain, no one can doubt but the Repre&s;entation was intended to be general and &s;trictly impartial; that every County, City and Borough &s;hould &s;end to the General A&s;&s;embly, a Number of it's In|habitants, duly elected, proportion'd to it's Rank and Importance: But by a Fluxation, which no human Policy can prevent, this Repre&s;entation, tho' in it's fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment it might have been perfectly equita|ble, became every Day liable to &s;uch Changes as pro|duced the pre&s;ent Inequality. Antient Cities and Boroughs lo&s;t their real Importance, and &s;unk into Ob&s;curity; while others, in the Cour&s;e of a few Years, became of the highe&s;t Value to the Community, by their exten&s;ive Trade and Manufactures.

<P>The Mini&s;ters of the Crown, ever &s;olicitious to ad|vance it's Prerogative, did, by no Means, choo&s;e to increa&s;e this Power of Repre&s;entation; but rather wi&s;h'd to le&s;&s;en it's Force, by having it lodg'd in &s;uch Hands as might become mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;ubjected to their Influence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To what can We &s;o naturally attribute the pre&s;ent Coincidence of Mini&s;terial and Parliamentary Power, as to the Increa&s;e of this <HI>pernicious Influence?</HI>&mdash;an Influence which mu&s;t very &s;hortly affect the Liberty of Great Britain as well as that of America, unle&s;s it receives a &s;udden and &s;ea&s;onable Check! The Antient Boroughs reduc'd to a State of Ob&s;curity and Poverty become ea&s;y Purcha&s;es for the Tools of the Court; and the pre&s;ent Machiavelean Mini&s;ter, refining upon a Sy&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;h'd by his Predece&s;&s;or Sir Robert Walpole, has with great Economy, bought up all the&s;e Bargains for &s;uch Gen|tlemen of the Army as have Talents fitted for the Support of his Party. There are undoubtedly many military Gentlemen who have Abilities to fill with Honour the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd Stations: But, as a Friend to my Country, and jealous of every Thing which may endanger it's Liberty, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I had rather &s;ee them upon the Parade at St. James's, than in the Parliament Hou&s;e at We&s;tmini&s;ter. The military Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons mu&s;t be thought very improper Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of Great Britain. Indeed They may, with great Propriety, be con&s;ider'd as no more than <HI>animated.

The Removal of General Conway from his military Command for daring to &s;peak the Language of Indepen|dence, mu&s;t &s;erve to convince Us, that, in the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration, the mo&s;t violent and arbitrary Mea&s;ures will be us'd to extend and &s;upport this dangerous Influence.
<P>When I mention the <HI>pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration,</HI> I mean to take no Notice of the many <HI>delu&s;ive changes</HI> which have been made to blind or amu&s;e the World.</P></NOTE> This very naturally accounts for that In|equality which at pre&s;ent prevails in the Repre&s;entation
<PB N="20" REF="010273_0011_0F7E48D4A4CB8E40">of England; and, from a Con&s;ideration of this &s;ingle Circum&s;tance, no Man can, with the lea&s;t Preten&s;ions to Rea&s;on, a&s;&s;ert, that, becau&s;e the Inhabitants of Bir|mingham and Sheffield are not repre&s;ented in exact Proportion to their Number, Wealth and Importance, the numerous Inhabitants of all the American Settle|ments &s;hall not be entitled to any Repre&s;entation at all. Ab&s;urd as this Doctrine may appear, it has lately been warmly &s;upported by the refin'd Logic of our State Sophi&s;ts; Who have, at a great Expence of Thought, elaborated for Us a Sy&s;tem of VIRTUAL REPRESENTA|TION, without allowing Us one Repre&s;entative, or any one Advantage which ought naturally to attend this happy In&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Members of the Briti&s;h Parliament can only be con&s;ider'd as Tru&s;tees for the Care and Direction of the Liberty and Property of their Con&s;tituents; and, of that They may at Di&s;cretion legally and con&s;titutio|nally di&s;po&s;e: But, with what Appearance of Rea&s;on, do They claim the Di&s;po&s;al of Property with which They were never entru&s;ted, or arrogate to Them&s;elves a Power to determine upon that Liberty which was never committed to their Care? Can the little, Self-important Member for <HI>Malden</HI> look upon Him&s;elf as a proper Repre&s;entative for the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets; or rea&s;onably conceive Him&s;elf ve&s;ted
<PB N="21" REF="010273_0011_0F7E48D4A4CB8E40">with more Power than could be transfer'd to Him from the venal Wretches by whom He was elected? Or can any Individual of the whole re&s;pectable Body, &s;ay, that He is duly qualify'd to repre&s;ent any one of the Colonies? Has He receiv'd any Power&mdash;does He own any Obligation; or is He influenc'd by the &s;ame In|tere&s;ts? All the&s;e are e&s;&s;ential Qualifications; and yet not one of the&s;e can He boa&s;t! How then can He ab|&s;urdly e&s;teem Him&s;elf qualifi'd to repre&s;ent a Body of People by whom He was never appointed&mdash;to whom He owes no Duty; and who&s;e Intere&s;ts are very pro|bably incompatible with his own?</P>
<P>I am very far from being an Enemy to Parliamentary Power. I revere the Hou&s;e of Commons as the Watch|ful Guardians pre&s;iding over the Liberty of their Con|&s;tituents; but when I &s;ee Them gra&s;ping at a Power altogether foreign, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of their own Con&s;titution; I could wi&s;h to &s;ee Them reduc'd within their natural Bounds, and would even &s;helter myfelf under the Wings of the Royal Prero|gative. I would much more willingly &s;ee my Property arbitratily di&s;pos'd of by a privy Seal, than extorted from me by the unwarrantable Power of a Parliament; who&s;e Members would naturally endeavour to le&s;&s;en their own Burthens, and gratify the &s;elfi&s;h Wi&s;hes of their Con&s;tituents by &s;acrificing to Them the Intere&s;ts of the Colonies.</P>
<P>As loyal and indu&s;trious Subjects We may expect impartial Favour from our Prince; who mu&s;t rea&s;on|ably regard with an equal Eye the Happine&s;s and Wel|fare of all his Dominions. An ambitious and enter|pri&s;ing Monarch might po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h to extend the

<P>The&s;e Sentiments are unhappily confirm'd by incon|te&s;table Facts; and the &s;lighte&s;t Examination of antient Hi&s;tory mu&s;t &s;erve to convince Us, that the Colonies of popular Governments have ever &s;uffer'd the &s;evere&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion, and groan'd under the mo&s;t intolerable Slavery.</P>
<P>A Heart the mo&s;t animated with the Spirit of Li|berty, if directed by a Head fraught with the lea&s;t In|formation, would naturally prefer the de&s;potic Sway of one Man, to the arbitrary Influence of Millions. The One might be ea&s;ily &s;atisfy'd, while the other would remain ever in&s;atiable. By the one We might rea&s;on|ably expect to be rais'd to the Happine&s;s of Subjects; but, by the other, We &s;hould be actually confin'd to a State of Va&s;&s;allage.</P>
<P>If We have not mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly err'd in the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment of our Principles, the World cannot be &s;urpris'd at the Oppo&s;ition which We have given to the unwarrantable Exertion of Parliamentary Power:&mdash;A Power, to which, if We once tamely &s;ubmit, We &s;hall &s;acrifice all the mo&s;t valuable Privileges of the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd Society.</P>
<P>If the Prince requires a Revenue for his own pri|vate Purpo&s;es, the Parliament grants Him an ample One, from a Duty laid upon our mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Impor|tations.
<PB N="23" REF="010273_0012_0F7E48D58533A658">If the Exigencies of Government require &pound; 300, 000, the Parliament will rai&s;e &pound; 400, 000 by a Stamp Duty.

<P>Upon the fir&s;t Attempts towards the carrying into Execution this la&s;t dete&s;table Act of the Briti&s;h Par|liament, the Genius of America was &s;uddenly awakened from her flattering Dream of ideal Security; and, with a Rapidity &s;carcely to be conceiv'd, communicated to her deluded Sons a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their impending Danger. Alarm'd at &s;o bold an Attempt to deprive Them of the mo&s;t e&s;timable Privileges of Society, in the fir&s;t uncollected Moments of Re&s;entment, They could only evidence the Spirit of that Re&s;olution, and the Warmth of that Unanimity, by which They

They felt too &s;en&s;ibly to rea&s;on coolly; nor could They readily conceive, that, after going the Lengths which They had proceed|ed, it would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary to go one Step further.
