<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter, one of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples ask'd our Lord to teach them to Pray; in an&s;wer to which reque&s;t, this great Prophet and Teacher of His Church, gives His Di&s;ciples an excellent Form or Pattern as a Rule for their Direction in Prayer; which is re|corded in this and the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> with &s;ome con&s;iderable difference. And He encourageth them to continue in&s;tant in Prayer, with per&s;evering Importunity, by declaring that if they Ask it &s;hall be given them; that if they &s;eek, they &s;hall find, and that if they Knock it &s;hall be

open'd to them. And our Lord illu&s;trates and confirms this Truth by a double &s;imi|litude or compari&s;on. The fir&s;t is that of a <HI>Friend,</HI> who is moved by importunity to grant his friend's reque&s;t, being urg'd to that which his kindne&s;s as a friend was not &s;ufficient to incline him to. The &s;econd is taken from an <HI>earthly Father,</HI> who&s;e pa|rental love to his Child will not by any means, &s;uffer him to give that which he knows to be hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tful, when his Child asks what is needful and proper to be given, <HI>ver.</HI> 11, 12.

<P>An&s; <HI>THE Third per&s;on in the Godhead.</HI> The word here us'd for Spirit &s;ignifies <HI>Breath</HI> or <HI>Wind:</HI> And it is ob&s;erv'd by a learned Man, that the Word for Spirit in the <HI>Hebrew, Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> &s;ignifies Breath.
<PB N="4" REF="003103_0006_0FEFA671FB5CCAE8">
Now by this Word the Divine <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> which is pure and &s;piritual, immaterial and invi|&s;ible, is &s;ometimes &s;ignified, in which the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t are <HI>One.</HI> But then, as this Name is in a peculiar manner given to the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;o it declares His e&s;pecial manner and order of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in relation to the Father and the Son, as He proceeds from them. Now it is very ob|vious that the Third Per&s;on in the <HI>Trinity</HI> is often call'd by this Name in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> and by a Name of the like &s;igni|fication in the <HI>Old.</HI> Thus in the old Te&s;ta|ment, Gen. 1.2. <HI>The Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters, P&s;al.</HI> 336. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. In the New Te&s;tament this word is fre|quently us'd to &s;ignify this Divine Per&s;on, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.5,&mdash;8. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Epithet <HI>Holy,</HI> is frequently given Him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.11. in our text and in many places in the New Te&s;ta|ment, which may be, not only to denote the holine&s;s of His Nature as He is God, but e&s;pecially in that it is <HI>His peculiar Work</HI> to &s;anctify, and <HI>make us holy.</HI> He proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Joh. 15.26. <HI>But when the Com&s;erter is come, whom I will &s;end from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which procce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth from the Fa|ther.</HI> He is call'd <HI>the Spirit of the Son,</HI> Gal 4.6.

<P N="2">II. <HI>IN what re&s;pects is God &s;aid to give, the Holy Spirit?</HI> Or thus, <HI>What is intended in God's giving the Holy Spirit?</HI> The Holy Spirit is in Scripture call'd the <HI>Gift of God,</HI> Joh. 4. 10.

Act. 2.33. Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, and <HI>having received of the Father the promi&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t, be hath &s;hed forth that which ye now &s;ee and hear.</HI></P>
<P>Here I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD's giving the Holy Spirit denotes <HI>His Authority and free Grace.</HI> This is a free Favour, and is of meer Grace, not of Debt. When we Pray for the Holy Gho&s;t, we mu&s;t come to the Throne of Grace with|out Money, and without Price. God hath Power to bellow Him, and He acts herein with Authority and the greate&s;t Freedom. We can do nothing to Purcha&s;e this Gift, or to oblige God to be&s;tow it upon us as a reward of Debt. No, we are unworthy of the lea&s;t of God's Mercies, much le&s;s can we in any mea&s;ure de&s;erve this Com|prehen&s;ive Gift. Ability to Ask aright, and the thing be&s;tow'd in an&s;wer to our humble Petition, are both of the free Mercy of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Spirit is &s;aid to be given <HI>re&s;|pecting His Office, as He is the Di&s;pen&s;er of all Good to God's People.</HI> The Spirit is <HI>E&s;&s;entially One,</HI> with the Father and with the Son, and as God acts with Sovereign Liberty. But then re&s;pecting His <HI>Office</HI> He

is &s;aid to be &s;ent and given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In the Communication of the Spirit, re&s;pect i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had unto his Effects, or the Ends for which he is given. The Authority of this Giving re&s;pects principally his Gifts and Graces. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> of the Holy Spirit, p. 81.</NOTE>.

And accordingly He is &s;aid to be given with an e&s;pecial Regard to tho&s;e excellent Gifts, Graces and Comforts which are Communicated by Him. The Holy Spirit is in His Divine Nature one and <HI>the &s;ame,</HI> without variablene&s;s: But in His Gifts and Operations He is <HI>various,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.11. <HI>But all the&s;e (gifts) worketh that one and &s;elf &s;ame Spirit&mdash;.</HI> Agreably we read of the <HI>&s;even Spirits of God,</HI> Rev. 4.5. i. e. the Holy Spirit in His manifold Di&s;pen&s;ations of Gifts and Graces.

<PB N="9" REF="003103_0011_0FEFA69C15B05670">
Je&s;us was not yet glorified,</HI> Joh. 7.39. The Holy Gho&s;t exi&s;ted from Eternity; but He was not re&s;pecting that <HI>peculiar Di&s;pen&s;ati|on</HI> and manife&s;tation of Him, which the Church was favour'd with, after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>WHAT is implied in Asking the Holy Spirit? How mu&s;t we attend this Duty?</HI> Now as we have already ob&s;erved, the Word &s;ignifies earne&s;tly to de&s;ire any thing, and humbly to beg it. It intends humble and earne&s;t Prayer. And thus the Word is us'd, Jam. 1.5. If any of you lack wi&s;dom, <HI>let him ask of God&mdash;</HI> And then, we mu&s;t Ask in a right manner, from a right principle, and for a right end.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN Asking of God His Holy Spirit, <HI>we mu&s;t offer up our hearty De&s;ires to Him.</HI> When we come before God to Ask His Holy Spirit, we mu&s;t be duly &s;en&s;ible how needful and excellent a Ble&s;&s;ing this is, and accordingly expre&s;s to God the inward de&s;ires and breathings of our Souls after it. We mu&s;t obey that Word, P&s;al. 62, 8&mdash;. <HI>Pour out your hearts before him&mdash;.</HI> We mu&s;t de&s;ire and value this great Ble&s;&s;ing, other|wi&s;e our Asking it will be but an empty Compliment, yea a mocking of God. We mu&s;t thir&s;t for this living Water, the plentiful Effu&s;ions of the Holy Spirit. As <HI>David</HI> longed, and &s;aid, <HI>Oh that one would
<PB N="10" REF="003103_0012_0FEFA6784C43D0F8">
give me drink of the water of the well of Beth|lehem</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 23.15.</NOTE> So mu&s;t we long for the&s;e holy Waters, and from our Hearts &s;ay, O that God wou'd Pour out His Spirit upon us! And then expre&s;s our hearty De&s;ires to God in Prayer. The thir&s;ty are invited to Come and drink, <HI>Job.</HI> 7.37. There may be true Prayer without the <HI>Voice,</HI> but not without the <HI>Heart;</HI> there mu&s;t be the Voice of the inward man.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WE mu&s;t Ask of God His Holy Spirit in a due &s;en&s;e of our own Sinfulne&s;s and Un|worthine&s;s.</HI> God gives Grace to the Hum|ble, but knows the Proud afar off: And therefore when we come before Him with our Reque&s;ts and Petitions, we mu&s;t come under an aba&s;ing &s;en&s;e of our own empti|ne&s;s and unworthine&s;s. We mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible that we are empty of all &s;piritual Good, till the Holy Spirit is Communica|ted to us, and that we are le&s;s than the lea&s;t of God's Mercies, and therefore mo&s;t unworthy of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing. We mu&s;t ask as Beggars ask an Alms. Thus the Word is u&s;ed, <HI>Act.</HI> 3.2. As we are &s;piri|tually poor, &s;o we mu&s;t have a gracious Poverty of Spirit while attending this Duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE mu&s;t Ask <HI>in the Name of our Lord
<PB N="11" REF="003103_0013_0FEFA69DB4B3D240">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in the exerci&s;e of Faith upon God as our Father in Him,</HI> Joh. 16.23.&mdash; Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, <HI>What&s;oever ye &s;hall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</HI> ver. 24. &mdash; <HI>Ask, and ye &s;hall re|ceive &mdash;.</HI> Our Saviour here requires His Di&s;ciples to make an explicit and expre&s;s mention of His Name in Prayer. When we come before God, we mu&s;t not come in our own name; but make mention of the Name of Chri&s;t, who is worthy, and hath purcha&s;ed the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t to be Communicated to His People. Now asking in the Name of Chri&s;t doth not intend meerly our making mention of the Name of Chri&s;t in our Prayers, but al&s;o our believing and intire Dependance on Him, His Merit and Mediation, for audi|ence and acceptance with God. He is our great <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> and our <HI>Advocate</HI> with the Father. He appears in the Pre&s;ence of God for us, as a Lamb that had been &s;lain; His Blood was offer'd once for all, and it hath a Voice to plead for us; it &s;peaks <HI>better things than the blood of Abel.</HI> He &s;its in Heaven as a Prie&s;t on a Throne, and is that <HI>Angel who offers much incen&s;e with the Prayers of the Saints</HI> upon the golden Altar which is before the Throne. And when the &s;moke of the Incen&s;e with the Prayers of the Saints,
<PB N="12" REF="003103_0014_0FEFA67DB827CB20">
a&s;cends up before God out of the Angel's Hand, God &s;mells a &s;weet &s;avour in the&s;e &s;piritual Sacrifices, and hath a gracious regard unto them for His Son's &s;ake. See Rev. 8.3, 4. We then who are Sinners, and have our be&s;t Duties defil'd with this accur&s;ed thing, mu&s;t take our Encourage|ment from the Merits of Chri&s;t, who hath a ju&s;t Claim by Purcha&s;e, to this Compre|hen&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing; and ask in His Name who is the Mediator between God &amp; Man. And then, having &s;uch an High Prie&s;t, Je|&s;us the Son of God, we &s;hould <HI>come boldly to the Throne of Grace, thot we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</HI> Heb. 4.16. We mu&s;t thro' Chri&s;t have our Faith in God, and come in humble Confi|dence as Children to a Father, believing that God is able and ready to be&s;tow a Fathers Ble&s;&s;ing upon us. He that cometh to God mu&s;t <HI>believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him,</HI> Heb. 11.6. We mu&s;t believe that God is &s;uch an One as He reveals Him&s;elf in His Word, and in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Particularly, that He is rich in Mercy to all that Call upon Him. Without Faith we cannot plea&s;e God in this Duty of Prayer, Jam. 1.6. <HI>Let him ask in Faith no|thing wavering&mdash;.</HI> Believe, and you &s;hall receive what you ask agreeable to God's
<PB N="13" REF="003103_0015_0FEFA67AAF4C7D70">
Will, either <HI>in &s;pecie,</HI> or in <HI>true value.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>WE mu&s;t he &s;ervent, and continue in|&s;tant in this Duty.</HI> This we are taught in our Context, ver. 9, 10. We mu&s;t ask, &s;eek and knock. We mu&s;t be importunate, as ver. 8. Jam. 5.16. &mdash;<HI>The effectual &s;ervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</HI> The <HI>inwrought Prayer.</HI> He that asks coldly, asks a dental<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Qui &s;rigide rogat, docet negare.</NOTE> We mu&s;t be &s;ervent in Spirit if we would obtain the gracious An&s;wer of our Prayers. We mu&s;t &s;trive and wre&s;tle in holy earne&s;tne&s;s, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, who&s;e wre&s;tling was accompanied <HI>with weeping and &s;upplication,</HI> Ho&s;. 12.4. And thus he had power over the <HI>Angel,</HI> over the <HI>Son of God,</HI> who is Jehovah, and pre|vailed. If we would not &s;eek in vain, we mu&s;t approve our&s;elves the genuine Sons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and refu&s;e to let the Lord go till He ble&s;s us. I may &s;ay with great reve|rence that God delights to be thus over|come by His People, i, e. <HI>He who is Almighty, is mo&s;t willing to yield to their importunate Prayers,</HI> Again, we mu&s;t continue in&s;tant in this Duty: As we are commanded. <HI>Rom,</HI> 12.12. We <HI>mu&s;t pray always, watching there|unto with per&s;everance.</HI> Eph, 6.18. If God &s;eem to &s;hut out our Prayers, we mu&s;t Pray the more earne&s;tly, and never cea&s;e till we obtain the An&s;wer of Prayer. Such
<PB N="14" REF="003103_0016_0FEFA68006391420">
Petitions never return empty, but always obtain of God either the very thing we ask for, or that which is better for us.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid of the nature of the Duty, and of the right manner of attending it, it is plain that the Asking here &s;poken of is a Duty which none but the Children of God, who have the Spirit of Adoption, can di&s;charge aright; and they are oblig'd to ask that they may receive the Holy Gho&s;t in more plentiful mea&s;ures, which &s;eems nextly intended in our Text, However, unregenerate Per&s;ons are al&s;o in|di&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to attend this moral Duty of Prayer, and to ask of God the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, that they may do it in a light manner. That moral impotency which is natural to us &s;ince the Fall, and con&s;i&s;ts very much in the rebel|lion of our Wills again&s;t God &amp; His Law doth not abridge God's Power to Command. And then there are tho&s;e general Promi&s;es, If I may &s;o call them, made to the Children and People of God, of the plentiful Effu|&s;ions of the Spirit, as are a gracious en|couragement even to &s;uch as are now de&s;ti|tute of &s;aving Grace, to ask of God His Holy Spirit.

You can remember how much you were con|cerned for their outward man when endan|gered by the late Sickne&s;s: And will you not be as much concerned for their Souls, which are under a more dangerous Di&s;tem|per by the Fall, and that an hereditary one which you have been in&s;trumental of con|veying to them? mo&s;t certainly you &s;hou'd. As Children of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> they are un|der the Cur&s;e of God's broken Covenant, and in danger of the &s;econd Death which is eternal. O be earne&s;t with God then to give them His Holy Spirit, that being united to <HI>Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam,</HI> they may obtain the Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant.

<P N="2">2. LET this Exhortation be directed <HI>to our Children and Young People.</HI> O be you Exhorted &amp; Encouraged to Ask of God His Holy Spirit. It is with an e&s;pecial regard to you that we are A&s;&s;embled this Day: Your Parents and Pa&s;tors are concerned for you, and earne&s;tly de&s;irous that you may be the Offspring which the Lord hath ble&s;&s;ed; and therefore they unite in &s;eek|ing to God for His Spirit to be given to you. And will not you join with them in asking this mo&s;t needed Ble&s;&s;ing? Cer|tainly you &s;hould with great importunity; for you will be accur&s;ed for ever unle&s;s you obtain it. You were by Nature dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, and Children of Wrath even as others, and &s;tand in ab&s;o|lute need of the Holy Spirit to renew a right Spirit in you. Unle&s;s you are born from above, born of the Spirit, it had been

better for you that you had not been born. However, you are generally the Children of the Covenant, and to you <HI>pertaineth the Adaption,</HI> Rom. 9.4. You have been <HI>Bap|tized&mdash;</HI> O &s;eek to God then that He would Baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t. You have heard how ready our Heavenly Father is to give His Spirit to them that ask him. Ask then, and you &s;hall receive. O dear Children! Go to your Heavenly Fa|ther in the Name of Chri&s;t, &s;ay, My Father! <HI>be thou the Guide of my Youth.</HI> O give me thy Spirit to unite me to thy Son, &amp; to form thine Image on my depraved Soul. I am blind, Open the eyes of my Under&s;tanding by the anointing of the Holy Spirit; my carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, it is not &s;ubject to thy Law, neither can be, O subdue it: my Affections are vile, O purify them! Thus Call upon God &amp; Cry to Him. And do not cea&s;e 'till a &s;aving Change be wro't on your Souls. You mult turn from all Sin unto God, and receive the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith, or peri&s;h forever. Do not then depend on this, that you have <HI>Abraham to your Father,</HI> and are the Children of the Covenant, as if your Parents Faith would &s;ave you.

Don't &s;atisfy your &s;elves with the blaze of an outward Profe&s;&s;ion, but bring your empty Ve&s;&s;els that they may be fill'd with the Oyl of &s;aving Grace. Open your Mouths wide, enlarge your De&s;ires, and God will fill them. You are not &s;traitned in God; O be not &s;traitned in your own bowels! Now &s;eek, and you &s;hall find. The time of Youth is probably the <HI>Accepted time</HI> with the mo&s;t that are Converted, &amp; who enjoy Go&s;pel-Priviledges from their Child hood, And it may be your <HI>only time</HI> for working out your Salvation.

Now there is nothing can pre|&s;erve you from this Apo&s;tacy but the Spiritual Pre&s;ence of God with you by His Spirit.
