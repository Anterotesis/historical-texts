<P>REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE, AND ON THE PROCEEDINGS IN CERTAIN SOCIETIES IN LONDON RELATIVE TO THAT EVENT. IN A LETTER INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO A GENTLEMAN <HI>IN PARIS.</HI></P>

<P>IT may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to inform the Reader, that the fol|lowing Reflections had their origin in a corre&s;pondence between the Author and a very young gentleman at Paris, who did him the honour of de&s;iring his opinion upon the important tran&s;actions, which then, and ever &s;ince, have &s;o much occupied the attention of all men. An an&s;wer was written &s;ome time in the month of Octo|ber <HI>1789;</HI> but it was kept back upon prudential con&s;iderations. That letter is alluded to in the beginning of the following &s;heets. It has been &s;ince forwarded to the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. The rea&s;ons for the delay in &s;ending it were a&s;&s;igned in a &s;hort letter to the &s;ame gentleman. This produced on his part a new and pre&s;|&s;ing application for the Author's &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The Author began a &s;econd and more full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;ubject. This he had &s;ome thoughts of publi&s;hing early in the la&s;t &s;pring; but the matter gaining upon him, he found that what he had underta|ken not only far exceeded the mea&s;ure of a letter, but that its impor|tance required rather a more detailed con&s;ideration than at that time he had any lei&s;ure to be&s;tow upon it. However, having thrown down his fir&s;t thoughts in the form of a letter, and indeed when he &s;at down to write, having intended it for a private letter, he found it difficult to change the form of addre&s;s, when his &s;entiments had grown into a greater extent, and had received another direction. A different plan, he is &s;en&s;ible, might be more favourable to a com|modious divi&s;ion and de&s;tribution of his matter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are plea&s;ed to call again, and with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, for my thoughts on the late proceedings in France. I will not give you rea&s;on to imagine, that I think my &s;entiments of &s;uch value as to wi&s;h my&s;elf to be &s;olicited about them. They are of too little con&s;equence to be very anxiou&s;ly either communicated or withheld. It was from attention to you, and to you only, that I he&s;itated at the time, when you fir&s;t de&s;ired to receive them. In the fir&s;t letter I had the honour to write to you, and which at length I &s;end, I wrote neither for nor from any de&s;cription of men; nor &s;hall I in this. My errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to an&s;wer for them.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, by the long letter I have tran&s;mitted to you, that, though I do mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h that France may be ani|mated by a &s;pirit of rational liberty, and that I think you bound in all hone&s;t policy, to provide a permanent body, in which that &s;pirit may re&s;ide, and an effectual organ, by which it may act, it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts con|cerning &s;everal material points in your late tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>You imagined, when you wrote la&s;t, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be reckoned among the approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the &s;olemn public &s;eal of &s;anction they have re|ceived from two clubs of gentlemen in London, called the Con&s;titutional Society, and the Revolution Society.</P>
<P>I certainly have the honour to belong to more clubs than one, in which the con&s;titution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious Revolution, are held in high reverence: and I reckon my&s;elf among the mo&s;t forward in my zeal for main|taining that con&s;titution and tho&s;e principles in their utmo&s;t purity and vigour. It is becau&s;e I do &s;o, that I think it nece&s;|&s;ary for me, that there &s;hould be no mi&s;take. Tho&s;e who cultivate the memory of our revolution, and tho&s;e who are at|tached to the con&s;titution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with per&s;ons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the Revolution and Con&s;titution, too frequently wander from their true principles; and are ready on every occa&s;ion to depart from the firm but cautious and deliberate &s;pirit which produced the one, and which pre&s;ides in the other. Before I proceed to an&s;wer the more material particulars in your letter, I &s;hall beg leave to give you &s;uch information as I have
<PB N="2" REF="023238_0004_0FBED27B2635AD60" MS="y">
been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought pro|per, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of France; fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring you, that I am not, and that I have never been, a member of either of tho&s;e &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t calling it&s;elf the Con&s;titutional Society, or Society for Con&s;titutional Information, or by &s;ome &s;uch title, is, I believe, of &s;even or eight years &s;tanding. The in&s;titution of this &s;ociety appears to be of a charitable, and &s;o far of a lauda|ble, nature: it was intended for the circulation at the expence of the members, of many books which few others would be at the expence of buying; and which might lie on the hands of the book&s;ellers, to the great lo&s;s of an u&s;eful body of men. Whether the books &s;o charitably circulated, were ever as cha|ritably read, is more than I know. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;everal of them have been exported to France; and like goods not in reque&s;t here, may with you have found a market. I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are &s;ent from hence. What improvements they have had in their pa&s;&s;age (as it is &s;aid &s;ome liquors are meliorated by cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea) I cannot tell: But I never heard a man of common judgement, or the lea&s;t degree of information, &s;peak a word in prai&s;e of the greater part of the publications circulated by that &s;ociety; nor have their proceedings been accounted, except by &s;ome of them&s;elves, as of any &s;erious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Your National A&s;&s;embly &s;eems to entertain much the &s;ame opinion that I do of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you re&s;erved the whole &s;tock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution Society; when their fellows in the Con&s;ti|tutional were, in equity, entitled to &s;ome &s;hare. Since you have &s;elected the Revolution Society as the great object of your national thanks and prai&s;es, you will think me excu&s;able in making its late conduct the &s;ubject of my ob&s;ervations. The National A&s;&s;embly of France has given importance to the&s;e gentlemen by adopting them; and they return the favour, by acting as a &s;ort of &s;ub-committee in England for extending the principles of the National A&s;&s;embly. Henceforward we mu&s;t con&s;ider them as a kind of privileged per&s;ons; as no incon&s;ider|able members in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which have given &s;plendour to ob&s;curity, and di&s;tinc|tion to undi&s;cerned merit. Until very lately I do not recollect to have heard of this club. I am quite &s;ure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts; nor, I believe, tho&s;e of any per&s;on out of their own &s;et. I find, upon enquiry, that on the anniver&s;ary of the Revolution in 1688, a club of di&s;&s;enters, but of what denomination I know not, have long
<PB N="3" REF="023238_0005_0FBED27F6BFD8D08">
had the cu&s;tom of hearing a &s;ermon in one of their churches; and that afterwards they &s;pent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard that any public mea&s;ure, or political &s;y&s;tem, much le&s;s that the merits of the con&s;titution of any foreign nation, had been the &s;ubject of a formal proceeding at their fe&s;tivals; until, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e I found them in a &s;ort of public capacity, by a congra|tulatory addre&s;s, giving an authoritative &s;anction to the pro|ceedings of the National A&s;&s;embly in France.</P>
<P>In the ancient principles and conduct of the club, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they were declared, I &s;ee nothing to which I, or any &s;ober man, could po&s;&s;ibly take exception. I think it very pro|bable, that for &s;ome purpo&s;e, new members may have entered among them; and that &s;ome truly chri&s;tian politicians, who love to di&s;pen&s;e benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand which di&s;tributes the dole, may have made them the in&s;truments of their pious de&s;igns. Whatever I may have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect concerning private management, I &s;hall &s;peak of nothing as of a certainty, but what is public.</P>
<P>For one, I &s;hould be &s;orry to be thought, directly or indi|rectly,concerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full &s;hare along with the re&s;t of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in &s;peculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the public &s;tage; in any place ancient or modern; in the republic of Rome, or the republic of Paris: but having no general apo&s;tolical mi&s;&s;ion, being a citizen of a particular &s;tate, and being bound up in a con&s;iderable degree, by its public will, I &s;hould think it, at lea&s;t improper and irregular, for me to open a formal public corre&s;pondence with the actual govern|ment of a foreign nation, without the expre&s;s authority of the government under which I live.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;till more unwilling to enter into that corre&s;pond|ence, under any thing like an equivocal de&s;cription, which to many, unacquainted with our u&s;ages, might make the addre&s;s, in which I joined, appear as the act of per&s;ons in &s;ome &s;ort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws of this king|dom, and authorized to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome part of it.</P>
<P>On account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unautho|rized general de&s;criptions, and of the deceit which may be practi&s;ed under them, and not from mere formality, the hou&s;e of Commons would reject the mo&s;t &s;neaking petition for the mo&s;t trifling object, under that mode of &s;ignature to which you have thrown open the folding-doors of your pre&s;ence chamber, and have u&s;hered into your National A&s;&s;embly, with as much ceremony and parade, and with as great a bu&s;tle of applau&s;e,
<PB N="4" REF="023238_0006_0FBED280B0652130">
as if you had been vi&s;ited by the whole repre&s;entative maje&s;ty of the whole Engli&s;h nation. If what this &s;ociety has thought proper to &s;end forth had been a piece of argument, it would have &s;ignified little who&s;e argument it was. It would be nei|ther the more nor the le&s;s convincing on account of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and re&s;olution. It &s;tands &s;olely on authority; and in this ca&s;e it is the mere authority of individuals, few of whom appear. Their &s;ignatures ought in my opinion, to have been annexed to their in&s;trument. The world would then have the means of knowing how many they are; who they are; and of what value their opinions may be, from their per&s;onal abilities, from their knowledge, their ex|perience, or their lead and authority in this &s;tate. To me, who am but a plain man, the proceeding looks a little too refined, and too ingenious; it has too much the air of a poli|tical &s;tratagem, adopted for the &s;ake of giving, under an high-&s;ounding name, an importance to the public declarations of this club, which, when the matter came to be clo&s;ely in&s;pected, they did not altogether &s;o well de&s;erve. It is a policy that has very much the complexion of a fraud.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf that I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty as well as any gentleman of that &s;ociety, be he who he will; and perhaps I have given as good proofs of my attachment to that cau&s;e, in the whole cour&s;e of my public conduct. I think I envy liberty as little as they do, to any other nation. But I can|not &s;tand forward, and give prai&s;e or blame to any thing which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a &s;imple view of the object as it &s;tands &s;tripped of every relation, in all the nakedne&s;s and &s;olitude of metaphy&s;ical ab&s;traction. Cir|cum&s;tances (which with &s;ome gentlemen pa&s;s for nothing) give in reality to every political principle its di&s;tingui&s;hing colour, and di&s;criminating effect. The circum&s;tances are what render every civil and political &s;cheme beneficial or noxious to man|kind. Ab&s;tractedly &s;peaking, government, as well as liberty, is good; yet could I, in common &s;en&s;e, ten years ago, have felicitated France on her enjoyment of a government (for &s;he then had a government) without enquiry what the nature of that government was, or how it was admini&s;tred? Can I now congratulate the &s;ame nation upon its freedom? Is it becau&s;e liberty in the ab&s;tract may be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the ble&s;&s;ings of mankind, that I am &s;eriou&s;ly to felicitate a madman, who has e&s;caped from the protecting re&s;traint and whole&s;ome darkne&s;s of his cell, on his re&s;toration to the enjoyment of light and liberty? Am I to congratulate an highwayman and murderer, who has broke pri&s;on, upon the recovery of his natural rights?
<PB N="5" REF="023238_0007_0FBED2821EC712F8">
This would be to act over again the &s;cene of the criminals con|demned to the gallies, and their heroic deliverer, the meta|phy&s;ic Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance.</P>
<P>When I &s;ee the &s;pirit of liberty in action, I &s;ee a &s;trong prin|ciple at work; and this, for a while, is all I can po&s;&s;ibly know of it. The wild <HI>gas,</HI> the fixed air is plainly broke loo&s;e: but we ought to &s;u&s;pend our judgment until the fir&s;t efferve&s;cene is a little &s;ub&s;ided, till the liquor is cleared, and until we &s;ee &s;omething deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy &s;urface. I mu&s;t be tolerably &s;ure, before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a ble&s;&s;ing, that they have really re|ceived one. Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more &s;ervice to the people than to kings. I &s;hould therefore &s;u&s;pend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government; with public force; with the di&s;|cipline and obedience of armies; with the collection of an ef|fective and well-di&s;tributed revenue; with morality and reli|gion; with the &s;olidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and &s;ocial manners. All the&s;e (in their way) are good things too; and, without them, liberty is not a benefit whil&s;t it la&s;ts, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they plea&s;e: We ought to &s;ee what it will plea&s;e them to do, before we ri&s;que congratulations, which may be &s;oon turned into com|plaints. Prudence would dictate this in the ca&s;e of &s;eparate in&s;ulated private men; but liberty, when men act in bodies, is <HI>power.</HI> Con&s;iderate people before they declare them&s;elves will ob&s;erve the u&s;e which is made of <HI>power;</HI> and particularly of &s;o trying a thing as <HI>new</HI> power in <HI>new</HI> per&s;ons, of who&s;e principles, tempers, and di&s;po&s;itions, they have little or no experience, and in &s;ituations where tho&s;e who appear the mo&s;t &s;tirring in the &s;cene may po&s;&s;ibly not be the real movers.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations however were below the tra&s;cenden|tal dignity of the Revolution Society. Whil&s;t I continued in the country, from whence I had the honour of writing to you, I had but an imperfect idea of their tran&s;actions. On my com|ing to town, I &s;ent for an account of their proceedings, which had been publi&s;hed by their authority, containing a &s;ermon of Dr. Price, with the Duke de Rochefaucault's and the Arch|bi&s;hop of Aix's letter, and &s;everal other documents annexed. The whole of that publication, with the manife&s;t de&s;ign of connecting the affairs of France with tho&s;e of England, by drawing us into an imitation of the conduct of the National A&s;&s;embly, gave me a con&s;iderable degree of unea&s;ine&s;s. The effect of that conduct upon the power, credit, pro&s;perity and
<PB N="6" REF="023238_0008_0FBED2846D142940">
tranquillity of France, became every day more evident. The form of con&s;titution to be &s;ettled, for its future polity, became more clear. We are now in a condition to di&s;cern, with tole|rable exactne&s;s, the true nature of the object held up to our imitation. If the prudence of re&s;erve and decorum dictates &s;ilence in &s;ome circum&s;tances, in others prudence of an higher order may ju&s;tify us in &s;peaking our thoughts. The beginnings of confu&s;ion with us in England are at pre&s;ent feeble enough; but with you we have &s;een an infancy &s;till more feeble, grow|ing by moments into a &s;trength to heap up mountains upon mountains, and to wage war with Heaven it&s;elf. Whenever our neighbour's hou&s;e is on fire, it cannot be ami&s;s for the engines to play a little on our own. Better to be de&s;pi&s;ed for too anxious apprehen&s;ions, than ruined by too confident a &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Sollicitious chiefly for the peace of my own country, but by no means unconcerned for your's, I wi&s;h to communicate more largely, what was at fir&s;t intended only for your private &s;atis|faction. I &s;hall &s;till keep your affairs in my eye, and continue to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you. Indulging my&s;elf in the freedom of epi&s;tolary intercour&s;e, I beg leave to throw out my thoughts, and expre&s;s my feelings, ju&s;t as they ari&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n my mind, with very little attention to formal method. I &s;et out with the pro|ceedings of the Revolution Society; but I &s;hall not confine my&s;elf to them. Is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould? It looks to me as if I were in a great cri&s;is, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circum|&s;tances taken together, the French revolution is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing that has hitherto happened in the world. The mo&s;t wonderful things are brought about in many in&s;tances by means the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous; in the mo&s;t ridiculous modes; and apparently, by the mo&s;t contemptible in&s;truments. Every thing &s;eems out of nature in this &s;trange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of all &s;orts of crimes jumbled together with all &s;orts of follies. In viewing this mon&s;trous tragi-comic &s;cene, the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;arily &s;ucceed, and &s;ome|times mix with each other in the mind; alternate contempt and indignation; alternate laughter and tears; alternate &s;corn and horror.</P>
<P>It cannot however be denied, that to &s;ome this &s;trange &s;cene appeared in quite another point of view. Into them it in&s;pired no other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of exultation and rapture. They &s;aw nothing in what has been done in France, but a firm and temperate exertion of freedom; &s;o con&s;i&s;tent, on the whole, with morals and with piety, as to make it de&s;erving not only of the &s;ecular applau&s;e of da&s;hing Machiavelian politicians,
<PB N="7" REF="023238_0009_0FBED287906D7990">
but to render it a fit theme for all the devout effu&s;ions of &s;acred eloquence.</P>
<P>On the forenoon of the 4th of November la&s;t, Doctor Richard Price, a non-conforming mini&s;ter of eminence, preached at the di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;e of the Old Jewry, to his club or &s;ociety, a very extraordinary mi&s;cellaneous &s;ermon, in which there are &s;ome good moral and religious &s;entiments, and not ill expre&s;&s;ed, mixed up in a &s;ort of porridge of various political opinions and reflections: but the revolution in France is the grand ingredient in the cauldron. I con&s;ider the addre&s;s tran&s;mitted by the Revolution Society to the National A&s;&s;embly, through Earl Stanhope, as originating in the principles of the &s;ermon, and as a corollary from them. It was moved by the preacher of that di&s;cour&s;e. It was pa&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who came reeking from the effect of the &s;ermon, without any cen&s;ure or qualification, expre&s;&s;ed or implied. If, however, any of the gentlemen concerned &s;hall wi&s;h to &s;eparate the &s;ermon from the re&s;olution, they know how to acknowledge the one, and to di&s;avow the other. They may do it; I cannot.</P>
<P>For my part, I looked on that &s;ermon as the public declaration of a man much connected with literary caballers, and intri|guing philo&s;ophers; with political theologians, and theological politicians, both at home and abroad. I know they &s;et him up as a &s;ort of oracle; becau&s;e, with the be&s;t intentions in the world, he naturally <HI>philippizes,</HI> and chaunts his prophetic &s;ong in exact uni&s;on with their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>That &s;ermon is in a &s;train which I believe has not been heard in this kingdom, in any of the pulpits which are tolerated or encouraged in it, &s;ince the year 1648, when a predece&s;&s;or of Dr. Price, the Reverend Hugh Peters, made the vault of the king's own chapel at St. James's ring with the honour and privilege of the Saints, who, with the <Q>high prai&s;es of God in their mouths, and a <HI>two</HI>-edged &s;word in their hands, were to execute judgment on the heathen, and puni&s;hments upon the <HI>people;</HI> to bind their <HI>kings</HI> with chains, and their <HI>nobles</HI> with fetters of iron <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxlix.</NOTE>.</Q> Few harangues from the pul|pit, except in the days of your league in France, or in the days of our &s;olemn league and covenant in England, have ever breathed le&s;s of the &s;pirit of moderation than this lecture in the Old Jewry. Suppo&s;ing, however, that &s;omething like mo|deration were vi&s;ible in this political &s;ermon; yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement. No &s;ound ought to be heard in the church but the healing voice of Chri|&s;tian charity. The cau&s;e of civil liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion by this confu&s;ion of duties.
<PB N="8" REF="023238_0010_0FBED288D977DDF0">
Tho&s;e who quit their proper character, to a&s;&s;ume what does not belong to them, are, for the greater part, ignorant both of the character they leave, and of the character they a&s;&s;ume. Wholly unacquainted with the world in which they are &s;o fond of meddling, and inexperienced in all its affairs, on which the pronounce with &s;o much confidence, they have nothing of politics but the pa&s;&s;ions they exite. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought to be allowed to the di&s;&s;en&s;ions and animo&s;ities of mankind.</P>
<P>This pulpit &s;tyle, revived after &s;o long a di&s;continuance, had to me the air of novelty, and of a novelty not wholly with|out danger. I do not charge this danger equally to every part of the di&s;cour&s;e. The hint given to a noble and reverend lay-divine, who is &s;uppo&s;ed high in office in one of our univer&s;i|ties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;e on the Love of our Country, Nov. 4, 1789. by Dr. Richard Price, 3d edition, p. 17 and 18.</NOTE>, and to other lay-divines "of <HI>rank</HI> and literature," may be proper and &s;ea&s;onable, though &s;omewhat new.

It is &s;omewhat remarka|ble that this reverend divine &s;hould be &s;o earne&s;t for &s;etting up new churches, and &s;o perfectly indifferent concerning the doc|trine which may be taught in them. His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the propagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions. It is not for the diffu&s;ion of truth, but for the &s;preading of contradiction. Let the noble teachers but di&s;&s;ent, it is no matter from whom or from what. This great point once &s;ecured, it is taken for granted their religion will be rational and manly. I doubt whether religion would reap all the benefits which the calculating divine computes from this "great company of great preachers." It would certainly be a valuable addition of non-de&s;cripts to the ample collection of known cla&s;&s;es, genera and &s;pecies, which at pre&s;ent beautify the <HI>hortus &s;iccus</HI> of di&s;&s;ent. A &s;ermon from a noble duke, or a noble marquis, or a noble earl, or baron bold, would certainly increa&s;e and dever&s;ify the amu&s;ements of this town, which begins to grow &s;atiated with the uniform round of its vapid di&s;&s;ipations.

<P>The new evangeli&s;ts will, I dare &s;ay, di&s;appoint the hopes that are conceived of them.

He tells the Revolution Society, in this political &s;ermon, that his maje&s;ty <Q>is almo&s;t the <HI>only</HI> lawful king in the world, becau&s;e the <HI>only</HI> one who owes his crown to the <HI>choice of his people.</HI></Q> As to the kings of <HI>the world,</HI> all of whom (except one) this archpontiff of the <HI>rights of men,</HI> with all the plenitude, and with more than the boldne&s;s of the papal depo&s;ing power in its meridian fervour of the twelfth century, puts into one &s;weeping clau&s;e of ban and ana|thema, and proclaims u&s;urpers by circles of longitude and lati|tude, over the whole globe, it behoves them to con&s;ider how they admit into their territories the&s;e apo&s;tolic mi&s;&s;ionaries, who are to tell their &s;ubjects they are not lawful kings. That is their concern. It is ours, as a dome&s;tic intere&s;t of &s;ome mo|ment, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the &s;olidity of the <HI>only</HI> principle upon which the&s;e gentlemen acknowledge a king of Great-Britain to be entitled to their allegiance.</P>
<P>This doctrine, as applied to the prince now on the Briti&s;h throne, either is non&s;en&s;e, and therefore neither true nor fal&s;e, or it affirms a mo&s;t unfounded, dangerous, illegal, and uncon|&s;titutional po&s;ition. According to this &s;piritual doctor of poli|tics, if his maje&s;ty does not owe his crown to the choice of his people, he is no <HI>lawful</HI> king. Now nothing can be more un|true than that the crown of this kingdom is &s;o held by his ma|je&s;ty. Therefore if you follow their rule, the king of Great-Britain, who mo&s;t certainly does not owe his high office to any form of popular election, is in no re&s;pect better than the re&s;t of the gang of u&s;urpers, who reign, or rather rob, all over the face of this our mi&s;erable world, without any &s;ort of right or title to the allegiance of their people. The policy of this ge|neral doctrine, &s;o qualified, is evident enough. The propa|gators

of this political go&s;pel are in hopes their ab&s;tract prin|ciple (their principle that a popular choice is nece&s;&s;ary to the legal exi&s;tence of the &s;overeign magi&s;tracy) would be everlook|ed whil&s;t the king of Great-Britain was not affected by it. In the mean time the ears of their congregations would be gradu|ally habituated to it, as if it were a fir&s;t principle admitted without di&s;pute. For the pre&s;ent it would only operate as a theory, pickled in the pre&s;erving juices of pulpit eloquence, and laid by for future u&s;e. <HI>Condo et compono quae mox depromere po&s;&s;im.</HI> By this policy, whil&s;t our government is &s;oothed with a re&s;ervation in its favour, to which it has no claim, the &s;ecu|rity, which it has in common with all governments, &s;o far as opinion is &s;ecurity, is taken away.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e politicians proceed, whil&s;t little notice is taken of their doctrines; but when they come to be examined upon the plain meaning of their words and the direct tendency of their doctrines, then equivocations and &s;lippery con&s;tructions come into play. When they &s;ay the king owes his crown to the choice of his people, and is therefore the only lawful &s;overeign in the world, they will perhaps tell us they mean to &s;ay no more than that &s;ome of the king's predece&s;&s;ors have been called to the throne by &s;ome &s;ort of choice; and therefore he owes his crown to the choice of his people. Thus, by a mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge, they hope to render their propo&s;ition &s;afe, by ren|dering it nugatory. They are welcome to the a&s;ylum they &s;eek for their offence, &s;ince they take refuge in their folly. For, if you admit this interpretation, how does their idea of election differ from our idea of inheritance? And how does the &s;ettlement of the crown in the Brun&s;wick line derived from James the fir&s;t, come to legalize our monarchy, rather than that of any of the neighbouring countries? At &s;ome time or other, to be &s;ure, all the beginners of dyna&s;ties were cho&s;en by tho&s;e who called them to govern. There is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of Europe were, at a re|mote period, elective, with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice; but whatever kings might have been here or el&s;ewhere, a thou&s;and years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dyna&s;ties of England or France may have begun, the King of Great-Britain is at this day king by a fixed rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, according to the laws of his country; and whil&s;t the legal conditions of the compact of &s;overeignty are performed by him (as they are performed) he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a &s;ingle vote for a king among&s;t them, either individually or collectively; though I make no doubt they would &s;oon erect them&s;elves into an elec|toral college, if things were ripe to give effect to their claim.

<P>A few years after this period, a &s;econd opportunity offered for a&s;&s;erting a right of election to the crown. On the pro&s;pect of a total failure of i&s;&s;ue from King William, and from the Prince&s;s, afterwards Queen Anne, the con&s;ideration of the &s;et|tlement of the crown, and of a further &s;ecurity for the liberties of the people, again came before the legi&s;lature. Did they this &s;econd time make any provi&s;ion for legalizing the crown on the &s;purious revolution principles of the Old Jewry? No. They followed the principles which prevailed in the Declaration of Right; indicating with more preci&s;ion the per&s;ons who were to inherit in the Prote&s;tant line. This act al&s;o incorparated, by the &s;ame policy, our liberties, and an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame act. In&s;tead of a right to choo&s;e our own governors, they declared that the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> in that line (the prote&s;tant line drawn from James the Fir&s;t) was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary <Q>for the peace, quiet, and &s;ecurity of the realm,</Q> and that it was equally urgent on them <Q>to maintain a <HI>certainty in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> thereof, to which the &s;ubjects may &s;afely have recour&s;e for their protection.</Q> Both the&s;e acts, in which are heard the unerring, unambiguous oracles of Revolution policy, in&s;tead of countenancing the delu&s;ive, gyp&s;ey predictions of a <Q>right to choo&s;e our governors,</Q> prove to a demon&s;tration how to|tally adver&s;e the wi&s;dom of the nation was from turning a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity into a rule of law.</P>
<P>Unque&s;tionably there was at the Revolution, in the per&s;on of King William, a &s;mall and a temporary deviation from the &s;trict order of a regular hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but it is again&s;t all genuine principles of juri&s;prudence to draw a principle from a law made in a &s;pecial ca&s;e, and regarding an individual per&s;on. <HI>Privilegium non tran&s;it in exemplum.</HI> If ever there was a time favourable for e&s;tabli&s;hing the principle, that a king of po|pular choice was the only legal king, without all doubt it was at the Revolution. Its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time. There is no per&s;on &s;o completely ignorant of our hi&s;tory, as not to know, that the majority in parliament of both parties were &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed to any thing re&s;embling that principle, that at fir&s;t they were determined to place the vacant crown, not on the head of the prince of Orange, but on that of his

wife Mary, daughter of King James, the elde&s;t born of the i&s;&s;ue of that king, which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite &s;tory, to recall to your memory all tho&s;e circum&s;tances which demon&s;trated that their accepting King William was not properly a <HI>choice;</HI> but, to all tho&s;e who did not wi&s;h, in effect to recall King James, or to deluge their country in blood, and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into the peril they had ju&s;t e&s;caped, it was an act of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t moral &s;en&s;e in which nece&s;&s;ity can be taken.</P>
<P>In the very act, in which for a time, and in a &s;ingle ca&s;e, parliament departed from the &s;trict order of inheritance, in favour of a prince, who, though not next, was however very near in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it is curious to ob&s;erve how Lord Somers, who drew the bill called the Declaration of Right, has comported him&s;elf on that de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icate occa&s;ion. It is curious to ob&s;erve with what addre&s;s this temporary &s;olution of continuity is kept from the eye; whil&s;t all that could be found in this act of nece&s;&s;ity to countenance the idea of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is brought forward, and fo&s;tered, and made the mo&s;t of, by this great man, and by the legi&s;lature who followed him. Quit|ting the dry, imperative &s;tyle of an act of parliament, he makes the lords and commons fall to a pious, legi&s;lative ejacu|lation, and declare, that they con&s;ider it <Q>as a marvellous pro|vidence, and merciful goodne&s;s of God to this nation, to pre&s;erve their &s;aid maje&s;ties <HI>royal</HI> per&s;ons, mo&s;t happily to reign over us <HI>on the throne of their ance&s;tors,</HI> for which, from the bottom of their hearts, they return their humble&s;t thanks and prai&s;es.</Q>&mdash;The legi&s;lature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the fir&s;t of Queen Elizabeth, Chap. 3d, and of that of James the Fir&s;t, Chap. 1&s;t, both acts &s;trongly declaratory of the inheritable nature of the crown; and in many parts they follow, with a nearly literal preci&s;ion, the words and even the form of thank&s;giving, which is found in the&s;e old declaratory &s;tatutes.</P>
<P>The two hou&s;es, in the act of king William, did not thank God that they had found a fair opportunity to a&s;&s;ert a right to choo&s;e their own governors, much le&s;s to make an election the <HI>only lawful</HI> title to the crown. Their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, was by them con&s;idered as a providential e&s;cape. They threw a politic, well-wrought veil over every circum&s;tance tending to weaken the rights, which in the meliorated order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion they meant to perpetuate; or which might furni&s;h a precedent for any future departure from what they had then &s;ettled for ever. Accordingly, that they might not relax the nerves of their

monarchy, and that they might pre&s;erve a clo&s;e conformity to the practice of their ance&s;tors, as it appeared in the declaratory &s;tatutes of Queen Mary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1&s;t Mary, Se&s;&s;. 3. ch. 1.</NOTE> and Queen Elizabeth, in the next clau&s;e they ve&s;t, by recognition, in their maje&s;ties, <HI>all</HI> the legal prerogatives of the crown, declaring, <Q>that in them they are mo&s;t <HI>fully,</HI> rightfully, and <HI>intirely</HI> inve&s;ted, incorporated, united, and annexed.</Q> In the clau&s;e which follows, for pre|venting que&s;tions, by rea&s;on of any pretended titles to the crown, they declare (ob&s;erving al&s;o in this the traditionary language, along with the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a rubric the language of the preceding acts of Elizabeth and James) that on the pre&s;erving <Q>a <HI>cer|tainty</HI> in the SUCCESSION thereof, the unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation doth, under God, wholly depend.</Q></P>
<P>They knew that a doubtful title of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would but too much re&s;emble an election; and that an election would be utterly de&s;tructive of the <Q>unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation,</Q> which they thought to be con&s;iderations of &s;ome moment. To provide for the&s;e objects, and therefore to exclude for ever the Old Jewry doctrine of <Q>a right to choo&s;e our own governors,</Q> they follow with a clau&s;e, containing a mo&s;t &s;olemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of Queen Elizabeth, as &s;olemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favour of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and as &s;olemn a renunciation as could be made of the principles by this &s;ociety imputed to them. <Q>The Lords &s;piritual and temporal, and commons, do, in the name of all the people afore&s;aid, mo&s;t humbly and faithfully &s;ubmit <HI>them&s;elves, their heirs and po&s;terities for ever;</HI> and do faithfully promi&s;e, that they will &s;tand to, maintain, and defend their &s;aid maje&s;ties, and al&s;o the <HI>limitation of the crown,</HI> herein &s;pecified and contained, to the utmo&s;t of their powers,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>So far is it from being true, that we acquired a right by the Revolution to elect our kings, that if we had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it before, the Engli&s;h nation did at that time mo&s;t &s;olemnly re|nounce and abdicate it, for them&s;elves and for all their po&s;terity for ever. The&s;e gentlemen may value them&s;elves as much as they plea&s;e on their whig principles; but I never de&s;ire to be thought a better whig than Lord Somers; or to under&s;tand the principles of the Revolution better than tho&s;e by whom it was brought about; or to read in the declaration of right any mi&s;|teries unknown to tho&s;e who&s;e penetrating &s;tyle has engraved in our ordinances, and in our hearts, the words and &s;pirit of that immortal law.</P>
<P>It is true that, aided with the powers derived from force and
<PB N="15" REF="023238_0017_0FBED297DA35A3F8">
opportunity, the nation was at that time, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, free to take what cour&s;e it plea&s;ed for filling the throne; but only free to do &s;o upon the &s;ame grounds on which they might have wholly aboli&s;hed their monarchy, and every other part of their con&s;titution. However they did not think &s;uch bold changes within their commi&s;&s;ion. It is indeed difficult, perhaps impo&s;|&s;ible, to give limits to the mere <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> competence of the &s;upreme power, &s;uch as was exerci&s;ed by parliament at that time; but the limits of a <HI>moral</HI> competence, &s;ubjecting, even in powers more indi&s;putably &s;overeign, occa&s;ional will to per|mament rea&s;on, and to the &s;teady maxims of faith, ju&s;tice, and fixed fundamental policy, are perfectly intelligible, and perfectly binding upon tho&s;e who exerci&s;e any authority, under any name, or under any title, in the &s;tate. The hou&s;e of lords, for in&s;tance, is not morally competent to di&s;&s;olve the hou&s;e of commons; no, nor even to di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, nor to abdicate, if it would, its portion in the legi&s;lature of the kingdom. Though a king may abdicate for his own per&s;on, he cannot abdicate for the monarchy. By as &s;trong, or by a &s;tronger rea&s;on, the hou&s;e of commons cannot renounce its &s;hare of authority. The engagement and pact of &s;ociety, which generally goes by the name of the con&s;titution, forbids &s;uch inva&s;ion and &s;uch &s;ur|render. The con&s;tituent parts of a &s;tate are obliged to hold their public faith with each other, and with all tho&s;e who derive any &s;erious intere&s;t under their engagements, as much as the whole &s;tate is bound to keep its faith with &s;eparate communi|ties. Otherwi&s;e competence and power would &s;oon be con|founded, and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force. On this principle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown has always been what it now is, an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by law: in the old line it was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the common law; in the new by the &s;ta|tute law, operating on the principles of the common law, not changing the &s;ub&s;tance, but regulating the mode, and de&s;crib|ing the per&s;ons. Both the&s;e de&s;criptions of law are of the &s;ame force, and are derived from an equal authority, emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the &s;tate, <HI>communi &s;pon&s;ione reipublicae,</HI> and as &s;uch are equally binding on king, and people too, as long as the terms are ob&s;erved, and they continue the &s;ame body politic.</P>
<P>It is far from impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile, if we do not &s;uffer our|&s;elves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphy&s;ic &s;ophi&s;try, the u&s;e both of a fixed rule and an occa&s;ional deviation; the &s;acredne&s;s of an hereditary principle of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in our go|vernment, with a power of change in its application in ca&s;es of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity (if we take the mea&s;ure of our rights by our exerci&s;e of them at the Revo|lution)
<PB N="16" REF="023238_0018_0FBED2A033157FD8">
the change is to be confined to the peccant part only; to the part which produced the nece&s;&s;ary deviation; and even then it is to be effected without a decompo&s;ition of the whole civil and political ma&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of originating a new civil order out of the fir&s;t element or &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A &s;tate without the means of &s;ome change is without the means of its con&s;ervation. Without &s;uch means it might even ri&s;que the lo&s;s of that part of the con&s;titution which it wi&s;hed the mo&s;t religiou&s;ly to pre&s;erve. The two principles of con|&s;ervation and correction operated &s;trongly at the two critical periods of the Re&s;toration and Revolution, when England found it&s;elf without a king. At both tho&s;e periods the nation had lo&s;t the bond of union in their ancient edifice; they did not, however, di&s;&s;olve the whole fabric. On the contrary, in both ca&s;es they regenerated the deficient part of the old con&s;ti|tution through the parts which were not impaired. They kept there old parts exactly as they were, that the part recovered might be &s;uited to them. They acted by the ancient organized &s;tates in the &s;hape of their old organization, and not by the organic <HI>moleculae</HI> of a di&s;banded people. At no time, perhaps, did the &s;overeign legi&s;lature manife&s;t a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of Briti&s;h con&s;titutional policy, than at the time of the Revolution, when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion The crown was carried &s;omewhat out of the line in which it had before moved; but the new line was derived from the &s;ame &s;tock. It was &s;till a line of heredi|tary de&s;cent; &s;till an hereditary de&s;cent in the &s;ame blood, though an hereditary de&s;cent qualified with prote&s;tanti&s;m. When the legi&s;lature altered the direction, but kept the princi|ple, they &s;hewed that they held it inviolable.</P>
<P>On this principle, the law of inheritance had admitted &s;ome amendment in the old time, and long before the aera of the Revolution. Some time after the conque&s;t great que&s;tions aro&s;e upon the legal principles of hereditary de&s;cent. It became a matter of doubt, whether the heir <HI>per capita</HI> or the heir <HI>per &s;tirpes</HI> was to &s;ucceed; but whether the heir <HI>per capita</HI> gave way when the heirdom <HI>per &s;tirpes</HI> took place, or the Catholic heir when the Prote&s;tant was preferred, the inheritable princi|ple &s;urvived with a &s;ort of immortality through all tran&s;migra|tions&mdash;<HI>multo&s;que per annos &s;tat fortuna domus et avi numerantur avorum.</HI> This is the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, not only in its &s;et|tled cour&s;e, but in all its revolutions. Whoever came in, or how ever he came in, whether he obtained the crown by law, or by force, the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was either continued or adopted.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Society for Revolutions &s;ee nothing in that of 1688 but the deviation from the con&s;titution; and they
<PB N="17" REF="023238_0019_0FBED2A1A719B078">
take the deviation from the principle for the principle. They have little regard to the obvious con&s;equences of their doctrine, though they mu&s;t &s;ee, that it leaves po&s;itive authority in very &s;ew of the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of this country. When &s;uch an unwarrantable maxim is once e&s;tabli&s;hed, that no throne is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes who preceded their aera of fictitious election can be valid. Do the&s;e theori&s;ts mean to immitate &s;ome of their predece&s;&s;ors, who dragged the bodies of our antient &s;overeigns out of the quiet of their tombs? Do they mean to attaint and di&s;able backwards all the kings that have reigned before the revolution, and con&s;equently to &s;tain the throne of England with the blot of a continual u&s;urp|ation? Do they mean to invalidate, annul, or to call into que&s;tion, together with the titles of the whole line of our kings, that great body of our &s;tatute law which pa&s;&s;ed under tho&s;e whom they treat as u&s;urpers? to annul laws of ine&s;timable value to our liberties&mdash;of as great value at lea&s;t as any which have pa&s;&s;ed at or &s;ince the period of the Revolution? If kings, who did not owe their crown to the choice of their people, had no title to make laws, what will become of the &s;tatute <HI>de tallagio non con|cedendo?</HI>&mdash;of the <HI>petition of right?</HI>&mdash;of the act of <HI>habeas corpus?</HI> Do the&s;e new doctors of the rights of men pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that King James the Second, who came to the crown as next of blood, according to the rules of a then unqualified &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was not to all intents and purpo&s;es a lawful king of England, before he had done any of tho&s;e acts which were ju&s;tly con&s;trued into an abdication of his crown? If he was not, much trouble in parliament might have been &s;aved at the period the&s;e gen|tlemen commemorate. But King James was a bad king with a good title, and not an u&s;urper. The princes who &s;ucceeded according to the act of parliament which &s;ettled the crown on the electre&s;s Sophia and on her de&s;cendants, being Prote&s;tants, came in as much by a title of inheritance as King James did. He came in according to the law, as it &s;tood at his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and the princes of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick came to the inheritance of the crown, not by election, but by the law, as it &s;tood at their &s;everal acce&s;&s;ions of Prote&s;tant de&s;cent and inheritance, as I hope I have &s;hewn &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>The law by which this royal family is &s;pecifically de&s;tined to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is the act of the 12th and 13th of King William. The terms of this act bind <Q>us and our <HI>heirs,</HI> and our <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> to them, their <HI>heirs,</HI> and their <HI>po&s;terity,</HI></Q> being Prote&s;tants, to the end of time, in the &s;ame words as the declaration of right had bound us to the heirs of King William and Queen Mary. It therefore &s;ecures both an hereditary crown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground, except the con&s;titu|tional

policy of forming an e&s;tabli&s;hment to &s;ecure that kind of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which is to preclude a choice of the people for ever, could the legi&s;lature have fa&s;tidiou&s;ly rejected the fair and abundant choice which our own country pre&s;ented to them, and &s;earched in &s;trange lands for a foreign prince&s;s, from who&s;e womb the line of our future rulers were to derive their title to govern millions of men through a &s;eries of ages?</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s Sophia was named in the act of &s;ettlement of the 12th and 13th of King William, for a <HI>&s;tock</HI> and root of <HI>inheritance</HI> to our kings, and not for her merits as a temporary admini&s;tratrix of a power, which &s;he might not, and in fact did not, her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er exerci&s;e. She was adopted for one rea&s;on, and for one only, becau&s;e, &s;ays the act, <Q>the mo&s;t excellent Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s and Dutche&s;s Dowager of Hano|ver, is <HI>daughter</HI> of the mo&s;t excellent Prince&s;s Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohemia, <HI>daughter</HI> of our late <HI>&s;overeign lord</HI> King James the Fir&s;t, of happy memory, and is hereby decla|red to be the next in <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tant line," &amp;c. &amp;c. and the crown &s;hall continue to the <HI>heirs</HI> of her body, being Prote&s;tants.</Q> This limitation was made by parliament, that through the Prince&s;s Sophia an inheritable line, not only was to be continued in future but (what they thought very material) that through her it was to be connected with the old &s;tock of inheritance in King James the Fir&s;t; in order that the monar|chy might pre&s;erve an unbroken unity through all ages, and might be pre&s;erved (with &s;afety to our religion) in the old ap|proved mode by de&s;cent, in which, if our liberties had been once endangered, they had often, through all &s;torms and &s;trug|gles of prerogative and privilege, been pre&s;erved. They did well. No experience has taught us, that in any other cour&s;e or method than that of an <HI>hereditary crown,</HI> our liberties can be regularly perpetuated and pre&s;erved &s;acred as our <HI>hereditary right.</HI> An irregular, convul&s;ive movement may be necce&s;&s;ary to throw off an irregular, convul&s;ive di&s;ea&s;e. But the cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is the healthy habit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Was it that the legi&s;lature wanted, at the act for the limitation of the crown in the Hanoverian line, drawn through the fe|male de&s;cendants of James the Fir&s;t, a due &s;en&s;e of the incon|veniencies of having two or three, or po&s;&s;ibly more, foreigners in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h throne? No!&mdash;they had a due &s;en&s;e of the evils which might happen from &s;uch foreign rule, and more than a due &s;en&s;e of them. But a more deci&s;ive proof can|not be given of the full conviction of the Briti&s;h nation, that the principles of the Revolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their plea&s;ure, and without any attention to the anci|ent fundamental principles of our government, than their

continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the old line, with all the dangers and all the inconveniencies of its being a foreign line full before their eyes, and operating with the utmo&s;t force upon their minds.</P>
<P>A few years ago I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to overload a matter, &s;o capable of &s;upporting it&s;elf, by the then unnece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of any argument; but this &s;editious, uncon&s;titutional doctrine is now publicly taught, avowed, and printed. The di&s;like I feel to revolutions, the &s;ignals for which have &s;o often been given from pulpits; the &s;pirit of change that is gone abroad; the total contempt which prevails with you, and may come to prevail with us, of all ancient in&s;titutions, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of convenience, or to the bent of a pre&s;ent inclination: all the&s;e con&s;iderations make it not unadvi&s;eable, in my opinion, to call back our attention to the true principles of our own dome&s;tic laws; that you, my French friend, &s;hould begin to know, and that we &s;hould continue to cheri&s;h them. We ought not, on either &s;ide of the water, to &s;uffer our&s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon by the counterfeit wares which &s;ome per|&s;ons, by a double fraud, export to you in illicit bottoms, as raw commodities of Briti&s;h growth though wholly alien to our &s;oil, in order afterwards to &s;muggle them back again into this country manufactured after the newe&s;t Paris fa&s;hion of an improved liberty.</P>
<P>The people of England will not ape the fa&s;hions they have never tried; nor go back to tho&s;e which they have found mi&s;|chievous on trial. They look upon the legal hereditary &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of their crown as among their rights, not as among their wrongs; as a benefit, not as a grievance; as a &s;ecurity for their liberty, not as a badge of &s;ervitude. They look on the frame of their commonwealth, <HI>&s;uch as it &s;tands,</HI> to be of ine&s;|timable value: and they conceive the undi&s;turbed &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown to be a pledge of the &s;tability and perpetuity of all the other members of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I &s;hall beg leave, before I go any further, to take notice of &s;ome paltry artifices, which the abettors of election as the only lawful title to the crown, are ready to employ, in order to ren|der the &s;upport of the ju&s;t principles of our con&s;titution a ta&s;k &s;omewhat invidious. The&s;e &s;ophi&s;ters &s;ub&s;titute a fictious cau&s;e, and feigned per&s;onages, in who&s;e favour they &s;uppo&s;e you en|gaged, whenever you defend the inheritable nature of the crown. It is common with them to di&s;pute as if they were in a conflict with &s;ome of tho&s;e exploded fanatics of &s;lavery, who formerly maintained, what I believe no creature now main|tains, <Q>that the crown is held by divine, hereditary, and inde|fea&s;ible right.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e old fanatics of &s;ingle arbitrary power
<PB N="20" REF="023238_0022_0FBED2A61873EEF8">
dogmatized as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful go|vernment in the world, ju&s;t as our new fanatics of popular ar|bitrary power, maintain that a popular election is the &s;ole law|ful &s;ource of authority. The old prerogative enthu&s;ia&s;ts, it is true, did &s;peculate fooli&s;hly, and perhaps impiou&s;ly too, as if monarchy had more of a divine &s;anction than any other mode of government; and as if a right to govern by inheritance were in &s;trictne&s;s <HI>indefea&s;ible</HI> in every per&s;on, and under every cir|cum&s;tance, which no civil or political right can be. But an ab&s;urd opinion concerning the king's hereditary right to the crown does not prejudice one that is rational, and bottomed upon &s;olid principles of law and policy. If all the ab&s;urd the|ories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which they are conver&s;ant, we &s;hould have no law, and no re|ligion, left in the world. But an ab&s;urd theory on one &s;ide of a que&s;tion forms no ju&s;tification for alledging a fal&s;e fact, or promulgating mi&s;chievous maxims on the other.</P>

them to take the &s;tep they took, and took with infinite reluct|ance, as under that mo&s;t rigorous of all laws. Their tru&s;t for the future pre&s;ervation of the con&s;titution was not in future revolutions. The grand policy of all their regulations was to render it almo&s;t impracticable for any future &s;overeign to com|pel the &s;tates of the kingdom to have again recour&s;e to tho&s;e violent remedies. They left the crown, what in the eye and e&s;timation of law, it had ever been, perfectly irre&s;pon&s;ible. In order to lighten the crown &s;till further, they aggravated re&s;pon&s;ibility on mini&s;ters of &s;tate. By the &s;tatute of the 1&s;t of King William, &s;e&s;&s;. 2d. called <Q>the act for declaring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and for &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown,</Q> they enacted, that the mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;erve the crown on the terms of that declaration. They &s;ecured &s;oon after the <HI>frequent meetings of parliament,</HI> by which the whole govern|ment would be under the con&s;tant in&s;pection and active con|troul of the popular repre&s;entative and of the magnates of the kingdom. In the next great con&s;titutional act, that of the 12th and 13th of King William, for the further limitation of the crown, and <HI>better</HI> &s;ecuring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, they provided, <Q>that no pardon under the great &s;eal of England &s;hould be pleadable to an impeachment by the commons in parliament.</Q> The rule laid down for govern|ment in the Declaration of Right, the con&s;tant in&s;pection of parliament, the practical claim of impeachment, they thought infinitely a better &s;ecurity not only for their con&s;titutional liber|ty, but again&s;t the vices of admini&s;tration, than the re&s;ervation of a right &s;o difficult in the practice, &s;o uncertain in the i&s;&s;ue, and often &s;o mi&s;chievous in the con&s;equences, as that of <Q>ca&s;h|iering their governors.</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Price, in this &s;ermon, condemns very properly the practice of gro&s;s, adulatory addre&s;&s;es to kings. In&s;tead of this ful&s;ome &s;tyle, he propo&s;es that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be told, on occa&s;ions, of congratulation, that <Q>he is to con&s;ider him&s;elf as more properly the &s;ervant than the &s;overeign of his people.</Q> For a compliment, this new form of addre&s;s does not &s;eem to be very &s;oothing. Tho&s;e who are &s;ervants, in name, as well as in effect, do not like to be told of their &s;ituation, their duty, and their obligations. The &s;lave, in the old play, tells his ma&s;ter, <HI>"Haec commemoratio e&s;t qui&s;i exprobratio."</HI> It is not plea&s;ant as compliment; it is not whole&s;ome as in&s;truction. After all, if the king were to bring him&s;elf to echo this new kind of addre&s;s, to adopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of Servant of the People as his royal &s;tyle, how either he or we &s;hould be much mended by it, I cannot ima|gine. I have &s;een very a&s;&s;uming letters, &s;igned, Your mo&s;t

obedient, humble &s;ervant. The proude&s;t domination that ever was endured on earth took a title of &s;till greater humility than that which is now propo&s;ed for &s;overeigns by the Apo&s;tle of Liberty. Kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling him&s;elf "the Servant of Servants;" and mandates for depo&s;ing &s;overeigns were &s;ealed with the &s;ignet of <Q>the Fi&s;herman.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould have con&s;idered all this as no more than a &s;ort of flippant vain di&s;cour&s;e, in which, as in an un&s;avoury fume, &s;everal per&s;ons &s;uffer the &s;pirit of liberty to evaporate, if it were not plainly in &s;upport of the idea, and a part of the &s;cheme of "ca&s;hiering kings for mi&s;conduct." In that light it is worth &s;ome ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Kings, in one &s;en&s;e, are undoubtedly the &s;ervants of the people, becau&s;e their power has no other rational end than that of the general advantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary &s;en&s;e (by our con&s;titution, at lea&s;t) any thing like &s;ervants; the e&s;&s;ence of who&s;e &s;ituation is to obey the commands of &s;ome other, and to be removeable at plea&s;ure. But the king of Great-Britain obeys no other per&s;on; all other per&s;ons are indi|vidually, and collectively too, under him, and owe to him a legal obedience. The law, which knows neither to flatter nor to in&s;ult, calls this high magi&s;trate, not our &s;ervant, as their humble Divine calls him, but <HI>"our &s;overeign Lord the King;"</HI> and we, on our parts, have learned to &s;peak only the primitive language of the law, and not the confu&s;ed jargon of their Babylonian pulpits.</P>
<P>As he is not to obey us, but as we are to obey the law in him, our con&s;titution has made no &s;ort of provi&s;ion towards rendering him, as a &s;ervant, in any degree re&s;pon&s;ible. Our con&s;titution knows nothing of a magi&s;trate like the <HI>Ju&s;ticia</HI> of Arragon; nor of any court legally appointed, nor of any pro|ce&s;s legally &s;ettled for &s;ubmitting the king to the re&s;pon&s;ibility belonging to all &s;ervants. In this he is not di&s;tingui&s;hed from the commons and the lords; who, in their &s;everal public capa|cities, can never be called to an account for their conduct; although the Revolution Society choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert, in direct oppo&s;ition to one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful parts of our con&s;titution, that <Q>a king is no more than the fir&s;t &s;ervant of the public, created by it, <HI>and re&s;pon&s;ible to it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ill would our ance&s;tors at the Revolution have de&s;erved their fame for wi&s;dom, if they had found no &s;ecurity for their freedom, but in rendering their government feeble in its operations, and precarious in its tenure; if they had been able to contrive no better remedy again&s;t arbitrary power than civil confu&s;ion. Let the&s;e gentlemen &s;tate who that <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> public is to whom they will affirm the king, as a &s;ervant, to be re&s;pon&s;ible.

<P>The ceremony of ca&s;hiering kings, of which the&s;e gentle|men talk &s;o much at their ea&s;e, can rarely, if ever, be performed without force. It then becomes a ca&s;e of war, and not of con&s;titution. Laws are commanded to hold their tongues among&s;t arms; and tribunals fall to the ground with the peace they are no longer able to uphold. The Revolution of 1688, was obtained by a ju&s;t war, in the only ca&s;e in which any war and much more a civil war, can be ju&s;t. "Ju&s;ta bella quibus <HI>nece&s;&s;aria.</HI>" The que&s;tion of dethroning, or, if the&s;e gentle|men like the phra&s;e better, "ca&s;hiering kings," will always be as it has always been, an extraordinary que&s;tion of &s;tate, and wholly out of the law; a que&s;tion (like all other que&s;tions of &s;tate) of di&s;po&s;itions, and of means, and of probable con&s;e|quences, rather than of po&s;itive rights. As it was not made for common abu&s;es, &s;o it is not to be agitated by common minds. The &s;peculative line of demarcation, where obedience ought to end, and re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t begin, is faint, ob&s;cure, and not ea&s;ily definable. It is not a &s;ingle act, or a &s;ingle event, which determines it. Governments mu&s;t be abu&s;ed and de|ranged indeed, before it can be thought of; and the pro&s;pect of the future mu&s;t be as bad as the experience of the pa&s;t. When things are in that lamentable condition, the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e is to indicate the remedy to tho&s;e whom na|ture has qualified to admini&s;ter extremities this critical, ambiguous, bitter portion to a di&s;tempered &s;tate. Times and occa&s;ions, and provocations, will teach their own le&s;&s;ons. The wi&s;e will determine from the gravity of the ca&s;e; the irritable from &s;en&s;ibility to oppre&s;&s;ion; the high-minded from di&s;dain and indignation at abu&s;ive power in unworthy hands; the brave and bold from the love of honourable danger in a generous cau&s;e: but, with or without right, a revolution will be the very la&s;t re&s;ource of the thinking and the good.</P>
<P>The third head of right, a&s;&s;erted by the pulpit of the Old Jewry, namely,the "right to form a government for our&s;elves," has, at lea&s;t, as little countenance from any thing done at the Revolution, either in precedent or principle, as the two fir&s;t of their claims.

the after-dinner toa&s;ts of the Revolution Society&mdash;In the former you will find other ideas and another language.

<P>Our olde&s;t reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will &s;ee that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to Black&s;tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Black&s;tone's Magna Charta, printed at Oxford, 1759.</NOTE>, are indu&s;trious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endea|vour to prove, that the ancient charter, the Magna Charta of King John, was connected with another po&s;itive charter from Henry I. and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the &s;till more ancient &s;tanding law of the kingdom. In the matter of fact, for the greater part, the&s;e authors appear to be in the right; perhaps not always: but if the lawyers mi&s;take in &s;ome particulars, it proves my po&s;ition &s;till the more &s;trongly; becau&s;e it demon&s;trates the powerful prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion towards antiquity, with which the minds of all our lawyers and legi&s;lators, and of all the people whom they wi&s;h to influence, have been always filled; and the &s;tati|onary policy of this kingdom in con&s;idering their mo&s;t &s;acred rights and franchi&s;es as an <HI>inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>In the famous law of the 3d of Charles I. called the <HI>Petition of Right,</HI> the parliament &s;ays to the king, <Q>Your &s;ubjects have <HI>inherited</HI> this freedom,</Q> claiming their franchi&s;es not on ab&s;tract principles "as the rights of men," but as the rights of Engli&s;hmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers. Selden, and the other profoundly learned men, who drew this petition of right, were as well acquainted, at lea&s;t with all the general theories concerning the <Q>rights of men,</Q> as any of the di&s;cour&s;ers in our pulpits, or on your tribune; full as well as Dr. Price, or as the Abb&eacute; Seyes. But, for rea&s;ons worthy of that practical wi&s;dom which &s;uper&s;eded their theoretic &s;cience, they preferred this po&s;itive, recorded, <HI>hereditary</HI> title to all which can be dear to the man and the ci|tizen, to that vague &s;peculative right, which expo&s;ed their &s;ure
<PB N="25" REF="023238_0027_0FBED2B2808865F8">
inheritance to be &s;crambled for and torn to pieces by every wild litigious &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;ame policy pervades all the laws which have &s;ince been made for the pre&s;ervation of our liberties. In the 1&s;t of Wil|liam and Mary, in the famous &s;tatute, called the Declaration of Right, the two hou&s;es utter not a &s;yllable of <Q>a right to frame a government for them&s;elves.</Q> You will &s;ee, that their whole care was to &s;ecure the religion, laws, and liberties, that had been long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had been lately endangered. <Q>Taking<NOTE PLACE="foot">1 W. and M.</NOTE> into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the <HI>be&s;t</HI> means for making &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, that their religion, laws, and liberties, might not be in danger of being again &s;ubver|ted,</Q> they au&s;picate all their proceedings, by &s;tating as &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>be&s;t</HI> means, "in the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> to do <Q>as their <HI>ance&s;tors in like ca&s;es have u&s;ually</HI> done for vindicating their <HI>antient</HI> rights and liberties, to <HI>declare;</HI></Q>&mdash;and then they pray the king and queen, <Q>that it may be <HI>declared</HI> and enac|ted, that <HI>all and &s;ingulur</HI> the rights and liberties <HI>a&s;&s;erted and declared</HI> are the true <HI>antient</HI> and indubitable rights and liber|ties of the people of this kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that from Magna Charta to the Declara|tion of Right, it has been the uniform policy of our con&s;titution to claim and a&s;&s;ert our liberties, as an <HI>entailed inheritance</HI> deri|ved to us from our forefathers, and to be tran&s;mitted to our po&s;terity; as an e&s;tate &s;pecially belonging to the people of this kingdom without any reference whatever to any other more ge|neral or prior right. By this means our con&s;titution pre&s;erves an unity in &s;o great a diver&s;ity of its parts. We have an in|heritable crown; an inheritable peerage; and an hou&s;e of commons and a people inheriting privileges, franchi&s;es, and liberties, from a long line of ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>This policy appears to me to be the re&s;ult of profound re|&s;tuction; or rather the happy effect of following nature, which is wi&s;dom without reflection; and above it. A &s;pirit of innovati|on is generally the re&s;ult of a &s;elfi&s;h temper and confined views. People will not look forward to po&s;terity, who never look back|ward to their ance&s;tors. Be&s;ides, the people of England well know that the idea of inheritance furni&s;hes a &s;ure principle of con&s;er|vation, and a &s;ure principle of tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion; without at all ex|cluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acqui&s;ition free; but it &s;ecures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtain|ed by a &s;tate proceeding on the&s;e maxims, are locked fa&s;t as in a &s;ort of family &s;ettlement; gra&s;ped as in a kind of mortmain for ever. By a con&s;titutional policy, working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we tran&s;mit our government and
<PB N="26" REF="023238_0028_0FBED2B39911F800">
our privileges, in the &s;ame manner in which we enjoy and tran&s;mit our property and our lives. The in&s;titutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of Providence, are handed down, to us and from us, in the &s;ame cour&s;e and order Our political &s;y&s;tem is placed in a ju&s;t corre&s;pondence and &s;ymmetry with the order of the world, and with the mode of exi&s;tence decreed to a permanent body compo&s;ed of tran&s;itory parts; wherein, by the di&s;po&s;ition of a &s;tupendous wi&s;dom, moulding together the great my&s;terious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but in a condition of unchangeable con&s;tancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and pro|gre&s;&s;ion. Thus, by pre&s;erving the method of nature in the con|duct of the &s;tate, in what we improve we are never wholly new; in what we retain we are never wholly ob&s;olete. By adhering in this manner and on tho&s;e principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the &s;uper&s;tition of antiquarians, but by the &s;pirit of philo&s;ophic analogy. In this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood; binding up the con&s;titution of our country with our dear|e&s;t dome&s;tic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the bo&s;om of our family affections; keeping in&s;eparable, and cheri&s;hing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our &s;tate, our hearths, our &s;epulchres, and our altars.</P>
<P>Through the &s;ame plan of a conformity to nature in our arti|ficial in&s;titutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful in&s;tincts, to fortify the fallible and feeble con|trivances of our rea&s;on, we have derived &s;everal other, and tho&s;e no &s;mall benefits, from con&s;idering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting as if in the pre&s;ence of canonized forefathers, the &s;pirit of freedom, leading in it&s;elf to mi&s;rule and exce&s;s, is tempered with an awful gravity. This idea of a liberal de&s;cent in&s;pires us with a &s;en&s;e of habitual native dignity, which prevents that up&s;tart in&s;olence almo&s;t inevitably adhering to and di&s;gracing tho&s;e who are the fir&s;t acquirers of any di&s;tinction. By this means our liberty be|comes a noble freedom. It carries an impo&s;ing and maje&s;tic a&s;pect. It has a pedigree, and illu&s;trating ance&s;tors. It has its bearings, and its en&s;igns armorial. It has its gallery of portraits; its monumental in&s;criptions; its records, evi|dences, and titles. We procure reverence to our civil in&s;titu|tions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men; on account of their age; and on account of tho&s;e from whom they are de&s;cended. All your &s;ophi&s;ters can|not produce any thing better adapted to pre&s;erve a rational and manly freedom than the cour&s;e that we have pur&s;ued. who have
<PB N="27" REF="023238_0029_0FBED2B6244A7B48" MS="y">
cho&s;en our nature rather than our &s;peculations, our brea&s;ts ra|ther than our inventions, for the great con&s;ervatories and ma|gazines of our rights and privileges.</P>
<P>You might, if you plea&s;ed, have profitted of our example, and have given to your recovered freedom a corre&s;pondent dig|nity. Your privileges, though di&s;continued, were not lo&s;t to memory. Your con&s;titution, it is true, whil&s;t you were out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;uffered wa&s;te and dilapidation; but you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;ome parts the walls, and in all the foundations of a noble and venerable ca&s;tle. You might have repaired tho&s;e walls; you might have built on tho&s;e old foundations. Your con&s;titution was &s;u&s;pended before it was perfected; but you had the elements of a con&s;titution very nearly as good as could be wi&s;hed. In your old &s;tates you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that variety of parts corre&s;ponding with the various di&s;criptions of which your community was happily compo&s;ed; you had all that combination, and all that oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, you had that action and counteraction which, in the natural and in the political world, from the re|ciprocal &s;truggle of di&s;cordant powers, draws out the harmony of the univer&s;e. The&s;e oppo&s;ed and conflicting intere&s;ts, which you con&s;idered as &s;o great a blemi&s;h in your old and in our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, interpo&s;e a &s;alutary check to all precipitate re&s;o|lutions; They render deliberation a matter not of choice, but of nece&s;&s;ity; they make all change a &s;ubject of <HI>compromi&s;e;</HI> which naturally begets moderation; they produce <HI>temperaments,</HI> preventing the &s;ore evil of har&s;h, crude, unqualified reforma|tions; and rendering all the headlong exertions of arbitrary power, in the few or in the many, for ever impracticable. Through that diver&s;ity of members and intere&s;ts, general liberty had as many &s;ecurities as there were &s;eparate views in the &s;everal orders; whil&s;t by pre&s;&s;ing down the whole by the weight of a real monarchy, the &s;eparate parts would have been prevented from warping and &s;tarting from their allotted places.</P>
<P>You had all the&s;e advantages in your antient &s;tates; but you cho&s;e to act as if you had never been moulded into civil &s;ociety, and had every thing to begin anew. You began ill, becau&s;e you began by de&s;pi&s;ing every thing that belonged to you. You &s;et up your trade without a capital. If the la&s;t generations of your country appeared without much lu&s;tre in your eyes, you might have pa&s;&s;ed them by, and derived your claims from a more early race of ance&s;tors. Under a pious predilection to tho&s;e ance&s;tors, your imaginations would have realized in them a &s;tandard of virtue and wi&s;dom, beyond the vulgar practice of the hour; and you would have ri&s;en with the example to who&s;e imitation you a&s;pired. Re&s;pecting your forefathers, you would have been taught to re&s;pect your&s;elves. You would not have

cho&s;en to con&s;ider the French as a people of ye&s;terday, as a nation of low-born &s;ervile wretches until the emancipating year of 1789. In order to furni&s;h, at the expence of your honour, an excu&s;e to your apologi&s;ts here for &s;everal enormities of yours, you would not have been content to be repre&s;ented as a gang of Maroon &s;laves, &s;uddenly broke loo&s;e from the hou&s;e of bondage, and therefore to be pardoned for your abu&s;e of the liberty to which you were not accu&s;tomed and ill fitted. Would it not, my worthy friend, have been wi&s;er to have you thought, what I, for one, always thought you, a generous and gallant nation, long mi&s;led to your di&s;advantage by your high and ro|mantic &s;entiments of fidelity, honour, and loyalty; that events had been unfavourable to you, but that you were not en&s;laved through any illiberal or &s;ervile di&s;po&s;ition; that in your mo&s;t devoted &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, you were actuated by a principle of public &s;pirit, and that it was your country you wor&s;hipped, in the per&s;on of your king? Had you made it to be under&s;tood, that in the delu&s;ion of this amiable error you had gone further than your wi&s;e ance&s;tors; that you were re&s;olved to re&s;ume your an|cient privileges, whil&s;t you pre&s;erved the &s;pirit of your ancient and your recent loyalty and honour; or, if diffident of your|&s;elves, and not clearly di&s;cerning the almo&s;t obliterated con&s;ti|tution of your ance&s;tors, you had looked to your neighbours in this land, who had kept alive the ancient principles and mo|dels of the old common law of Europe meliorated and adapted to its pre&s;ent &s;tate&mdash;by following wi&s;e examples you would have given new examples of wi&s;dom to the world. You would have rendered the cau&s;e of liberty venerable in the eyes of every wor|thy mind in every nation. You would have &s;hamed de&s;poti&s;m from the earth, by &s;hewing that freedom was not only reconci|leable, but as, when well di&s;ciplined it is, auxiliary to law. You would have had an unoppre&s;&s;ive but a productive revenue. You would have had a flouri&s;hing commerce to feed it. You would have had a free con&s;titution; a potent monarchy; a di&s;|ciplined army; a reformed and venerated clergy; a mitigated but &s;pirited nobility, to lead your virtue, not to overlay it; you would have had a liberal order of commons, to emulate and to recruit that nobility; you would have had a protected, &s;atisfied, laborious, and obedient people, taught to &s;eek and to recognize the happine&s;s that is to be found by virtue in all conditions; in which con&s;i&s;ts the true moral equality of man|kind, and not in that mon&s;trous fiction, which, by in&s;piring fal&s;e ideas and vain expectations into men de&s;tined to travel in the ob&s;cure walk of laborious life, &s;erves only to aggravate and imbitter that real inequality, which it never can remove; and which the order of civil life e&s;tabli&s;hes as much for the benefit

of tho&s;e whom it mu&s;t leave in an humble &s;tate, as tho&s;e whom it is able to exalt to a condition more &s;plendid, but not more happy. You had a &s;mooth and ea&s;y career of felicity and glory laid open to you, beyond any thing recorded in the hi&s;tory of the world; but you have &s;hewn that difficulty is good for man.</P>
<P>Compute your gains: &s;ee what is got by tho&s;e extravagant and pre&s;umptuous &s;peculations, which have taught your leaders to de&s;pi&s;e all their predece&s;&s;ors, and all their contemporaries, and even to de&s;pi&s;e them&s;elves, until the moment in which they became truly de&s;picable. By following tho&s;e fal&s;e lights, France has bought undi&s;gui&s;ed calamities at a higher price than any nation has purcha&s;ed the mo&s;t unequivocal ble&s;&s;ings! France has bought poverty by crime! France has not &s;acrificed her virtue to her intere&s;t; but &s;he has abandoned her intere&s;t, that &s;he might pro&s;titute her virtue. All other nations have begun the fabric of a new government, or the reformation of an old, by e&s;tabli&s;hing originally, or by enforcing with greater exact|ne&s;s &s;ome rites or other of religion. All other people have laid the foundations of civil freedom in &s;everer manners, and a &s;y&s;tem of a more au&s;tere and ma&s;culine morality. France, when &s;he let loo&s;e the reins of regal authority, doubled the licen&s;e, of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocious di&s;&s;olutene&s;s in manners, and of an in&s;olent irreligion in opinions and practices; and has extended through all ranks of life, as if &s;he were communicating &s;ome privilege, or laying open &s;ome &s;ecluded benefit, all the unhappy corrup|tions that u&s;ually were the di&s;ea&s;e of wealth and power. This is one of the new principles of equality in France.</P>
<P>France, by the perfidy of her leaders, has utterly di&s;graced the tone of lenient council in the cabinets of princes, and di&s;|armed it of its mo&s;t potent topics. She has &s;anctified the dark &s;u&s;picious maxims of tyrannous di&s;tru&s;t; and taught kings to tremble at (what will hereafter be called) the delu&s;ive plau|&s;ibilities, of moral politicians. Sovereigns will con&s;ider tho&s;e who advi&s;e them to place an unlimited confidence in their peo|ple, as &s;ubverters of their thrones; as traitors who aim at their de&s;truction, by leading their ea&s;y good-nature, under &s;pecious pretences, to admit combinations of bold and faithle&s;s men into a participation of their power. This alone (if there were nothing el&s;e) is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that your parliament of Paris told your king, that in calling the &s;tates together, he had nothing to fear but the prodigal exce&s;s of their zeal in providing for the &s;upport of the throne. It is right that the&s;e men &s;hould hide their heads. It is right that they &s;hould bear their part in the ruin which their coun&s;el has brought on their &s;overeign and their country. Such &s;anguine declarations tend to lull authority a&s;leep; to encour|age

it ra&s;hly to engage in perilous adventures of untried policy; to neglect tho&s;e provi&s;ions, preparations, and precautions, which di&s;tingui&s;h benevolence from imbecillity; and without which no man can an&s;wer for the &s;alutary effect of any ab&s;tract plan of government or of freedom. For want of the&s;e, they have &s;een the medicine of the &s;tate corrupted into its poi&s;on. They have &s;een the French rebel again&s;t a mild and lawful monarch, with more fury, outrage, and in&s;ult, than ever any people has been known to ri&s;e again&s;t the mo&s;t illegal u&s;urper, or the mo&s;t &s;anguinary tyrant. Their re&s;i&s;tance was made to conce&s;&s;ion; their revolt was from protection; their blow was aimed at an hand holding out graces, favours, and immunities.</P>
<P>This was unnatural. The re&s;t is in order. They have found their puni&s;hment in their &s;ucce&s;s. Laws overturned; tribunals &s;ubverted; indu&s;try without vigour; commerce expiring; the revenue unpaid, yet the people impoveri&s;hed; a church pillaged, and a &s;tate not relieved; civil and military anarchy made the con&s;titution of the kingdom; every thing human and divine &s;acrificed to the idol of public credit, and national bankruptcy the con&s;equence; and to crown all, the paper &s;ecurities of new, precarious, tottering power, the di&s;credited paper &s;ecurities of impoveri&s;hed fraud, and beggared rapine, held out a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a cur|rency for the &s;upport of an empire, in lieu of the two great recognized &s;pecies that repre&s;ent the la&s;ting conventional credit of mankind, which di&s;appeared and hid them&s;elves in the earth from whence they came, when the principle of property, who&s;e creatures and repre&s;entatives they are, was &s;y&s;tematically &s;ub|verted.</P>
<P>Were all the&s;e dreadful things nece&s;&s;ary? were they the in|evitable re&s;ults of the de&s;perate &s;truggle of determined patriots, compelled to wade through blood and tumult, to the quiet &s;hore of a tranquil and pro&s;perous liberty? No! nothing like it. The fre&s;h ruins of France, which &s;hock our feelings wherever we can turn our eyes, are not the deva&s;tation of civil war; they are the &s;ad but in&s;tructive monuments of ra&s;h and ignorant coun&s;el in time of profound peace. They are the di&s;play of in|con&s;iderate and pre&s;umptuous, becau&s;e unre&s;i&s;ted and irre&s;i&s;tible authority. The per&s;ons who have thus &s;quandered away the pre|cious trea&s;ure of their crimes, the per&s;ons who have made this prodigal and wild wa&s;te of public evils (the la&s;t &s;take re&s;erved for the ultimate, ran&s;om of the &s;tate) have met in their progre&s;s with little, or rather with no oppo&s;ition at all. Their whole march was more like a triumphal proce&s;&s;ion than the progre&s;s of a war. Their pioneers have gone before them, and demo|li&s;hed and laid every thing level at their feet. Not one drop of <HI>their</HI> blood have they &s;hed in the cau&s;e of the country they

They have made no &s;acrifices to their projects of greater con&s;equence than their &s;hoe-buckles, whil&s;t they were impri&s;oning their king, murdering their fellow citizens, and bathing in tears, and plunging in poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, thou|&s;ands of worthy men and worthy families. Their cruelty has not even been the ba&s;e re&s;ult of fear. It has been the effect of their &s;en&s;e of perfect &s;afety, in authorizing trea&s;ons, robberies, rapes, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, &s;laughters, and burnings throughout their har|ra&s;&s;ed land. But the cau&s;e of all was plain from the beginning.</P>
<P>This unforced choice, this fond election of evil, would ap|pear perfectly unaccountable, if we did not con&s;ider the com|po&s;ition of the National A&s;&s;embly; I do not mean its formal con&s;titution, which, as it now &s;tands, is exceptionable enough, but the materials of which in a great mea&s;ure it is compo&s;ed, which is of ten thou&s;and times greater con&s;equence than all the formalities in the world. If we were to know nothing of this A&s;&s;embly but by its title and function, no colours could paint to the imagination any thing more venerable. In that light the mind of an enquirer, &s;ubdued by &s;uch an awful image as that of the virtue and wi&s;dom of a whole people collected into a focus, would pau&s;e and he&s;itate in condemning things even of the very wor&s;t a&s;pect. In&s;tead of blameable, they would appear only my&s;terious. But no name, no power, no function, no artificial in&s;titution what&s;oever, can make the men of whom any &s;y&s;tem of authority is compo&s;ed, any other than God, and nature, and education, and their habits of life have made them. Capaci|ties beyond the&s;e the people have not to give. Virtue and wi&s;dom may be the objects of their choice; but their choice confers neither the one nor the other on tho&s;e upon whom they lay their ordaining hands. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve not the engagement of nature, they have not the promi&s;e of revelation for any &s;uch powers.</P>
<P>After I had read over the li&s;t of the per&s;ons and de&s;criptions elected into the <HI>Tiers Etat,</HI> nothing which they afterwards did could appear a&s;toni&s;hing. Among them, indeed, I &s;aw &s;ome of known rank; &s;ome of &s;hining talents; but of any practical experience in the &s;tate, not one man was to be found. The be&s;t were only men of theory. But whatever the di&s;tingui&s;hed few may have been, it is the &s;ub&s;tance and ma&s;s of the body which con&s;titutes its character, and mu&s;t finally determine its direc|tion. In all bodies, tho&s;e who will lead, mu&s;t al&s;o in a con&s;i|derable degree, follow. They mu&s;t conform their propo&s;itions to the ta&s;te, talent, and di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e whom they wi&s;h to conduct: therefore, if an A&s;&s;embly is viciou&s;ly or feebly com|po&s;ed in a very great part of it, nothing but &s;uch a &s;upreme degree of virtue as very rarely appears in the world, and for
<PB N="32" REF="023238_0034_0FBED2C39B1ACFF0" MS="y">
that rea&s;on cannot enter into calculation, will prevent the men of talents di&s;&s;eminated through it from becoming only the expert in&s;truments of ab&s;urd projects! If what is the more likely event, in&s;tead of that unu&s;ual degree of virtue, they &s;hould be actuated by &s;ini&s;ter ambition and a lu&s;t of meretricious glory, then the feeble part of the A&s;&s;embly, to whom at fir&s;t they conform, becomes in its turn the dupe and in&s;trument of their de&s;igns. In this political traffick the leaders will be obliged to bow to the ignorance of their followers, and the followers to become &s;ub&s;ervient to the wor&s;t de&s;igns of their leaders.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure any degree of &s;obriety in the propo&s;itions made by the leaders in any public a&s;&s;embly, they ought to re&s;pect, in &s;ome degree perhaps to fear, tho&s;e whom they conduct. To be led any otherwi&s;e than blindly, the followers mu&s;t be qualified, if not for actors, at lea&s;t for judges; they mu&s;t al&s;o be judges of natural weight and authority. Nothing can &s;ecure a &s;teady and moderate conduct in &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, but that the body of them &s;hould be re&s;pectably compo&s;ed, in point of condition in life, of permanent property, of education, and of &s;uch habits as enlarge and liberalize the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In the calling of the &s;tates general of France, the fir&s;t thing which &s;truck me, was a great departue from the ancient cour&s;e. I found the repre&s;entation for the Third E&s;tate compo&s;ed of &s;ix hundred per&s;ons. They were equal in number to the repre&s;enta|tives of both the other orders. If the orders were to act &s;eparately the number would not, beyond the con&s;ideration of the expence, be of much moment. But when it became apparent that the three orders were to be melted down into one, the policy and nece&s;&s;ary effect of this numerous rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntation became obvious. A very &s;mall de&s;ertion from either of the other two orders mu&s;t throw the power of both into the hands of the third. In fact, the whole power of the &s;tate was &s;oon re&s;olved into that body. Its due compo&s;iti|on became therefore of infinitely the greater importance.</P>
<P>Judge, Sir, of my &s;urpize, when I found that a very great proportion of the A&s;&s;embly (a majority, I believe, of the members who attended) was compo&s;ed of practitioners in the law. It was compo&s;ed not of di&s;tingui&s;hed magi&s;trates, who had given pledges to their country of their &s;cience, prudence, and integrity; not of leading advocates, the glory of the bar; not of renowned profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities;&mdash;but for the far greater part, as it mu&s;t in &s;uch a number, of the inferior, unlearned, mechanical, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rely in&s;trumental members of the profe&s;&s;ion.

whole train of the mini&s;ters of municipal litigation, the foment|ors and conductors of the petty war of village vexation. From the moment I read the li&s;t I &s;aw di&s;tinctly, and very nearly as it has happened, all that was to follow.</P>
<P>The degree of e&s;timation in which any profe&s;&s;ion is held becomes the &s;tandard of the e&s;timation in which the profe&s;&s;ors hold them&s;elves. Whatever the per&s;onal merits of many indi|vidual lawyers might have been, and in many it was undoubtedly very con&s;iderable, in that military kingdom, no part of the profe&s;&s;ion had been much regarded, except the highe&s;t of all, who often united to their profe&s;&s;ional offices great family &s;plen|dour, and were inve&s;ted with great power and authority. The&s;e certainly were highly re&s;pected, and even with no &s;mall degree of awe. The next rank was not much e&s;teemed; the mechanical part was in a very low degree of repute.</P>
<P>Whenever the &s;upreme authority is inve&s;ted in a body &s;o compo&s;ed, it mu&s;t evidently produce the con&s;equences of &s;upreme authority placed in the hands of men not taught habitually to re&s;pect them&s;elves; who had no previous fortune in character at &s;take; who could not be expected to bear with moderation, or to conduct with di&s;cretion, a power which they them&s;elves, more than any others, mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed to find in their hands. Who could flatter him&s;elf that the&s;e men, &s;uddenly, and, as it were, by enchantment, &s;natched from the humble&s;t rank of &s;ubordin|ation, would not be intoxicated with their unprepared greatne&s;s? Who could conceive, that men who are habitually meddling, daring, &s;ubtile, active, of litigious di&s;po&s;itions and unquiet minds, would ea&s;ily fall back into their old condition of ob&s;cure contention, and laborious, low, unprofitable chicane? Who could doubt but that, at any expence to the &s;tate, of which they under&s;tood nothing, they mu&s;t pur&s;ue their private intere&s;ts, which they under&s;tood but too well? It was not an event depend|ing on chance or contingency. It was inevitable; it was nece&s;&s;ary; it was planted in the nature of things. They mu&s;t <HI>join</HI> (if their capacity did not permit them to <HI>lead</HI>) in any pro|ject which could procure to them a <HI>litigious con&s;titution;</HI> which could lay open to them tho&s;e innumerable lucrative jobs which follow in the train of all great convul&s;ions and revolutions in the &s;tate, and particularly in all great and violent permutations of property. Was it to be expected that they would attend to the &s;tability of property, who&s;e exi&s;tence had always depended upon whatever rendered property que&s;tionable, ambiguous, and in&s;ecure? Their objects would be enlarged with their elevation, but their di&s;po&s;ition and habits, and mode of accompli&s;hing their de&s;igns, mu&s;t remain the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Well! but the&s;e men were to be tempered and re&s;trained by
<PB N="34" REF="023238_0036_0FBED2CC8EF21490">
other de&s;criptions, of more &s;ober minds, and more enlarged under&s;tandings. Were they then to be awed by the &s;uper-em|inent authority and awful dignity of an handful of country clowns who have &s;eats in that A&s;&s;embly, &s;ome of whom are &s;aid not to be able to read and write? and by not a greater number of traders, who, though &s;omewhat more in&s;tructed, and more con&s;picuous in the order of &s;ociety, had never known any thing beyond their counting hou&s;e; No! both the&s;e de&s;criptions were more formed to be overborne and &s;wayed by the intrigues and artifices of lawyers, than to become their counterpoi&s;e. With &s;uch a dangerous di&s;proportion, the whole mu&s;t needs be governed by them. To the faculty of law was joined a pretty con&s;ider|able proportion of the faculty of medicine. This faculty had not, any more than that of the law, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in France its ju&s;t e&s;timation. Its profe&s;&s;ors therefore mu&s;t have the qualities of men not habituated to &s;entiments of dignity. But &s;uppo&s;ing they had ranked as they ought to do, and as with us they do actually, the &s;ides of &s;ick beds are not the academies for forming &s;tate&s;men and legi&s;lators. Then came the dealers in &s;tocks and funds, who mu&s;t be eager, at any expence, to change their ideal paper wealth for the more &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of land. To the&s;e were joined men of other de&s;criptions, from whom as little knowledge of or attention to the intere&s;ts of a great &s;tate was to be expected, and as little regard to the &s;tability of any in&s;titution; men formed to be in&s;truments, not controls. Such in general was the compo&s;ition of the <HI>Tiers Etat</HI> in the National A&s;&s;embly; in which was &s;carcely to be perceived the &s;lighte&s;t traces of what we call the natural landed intere&s;t of the country.</P>
<P>We know that the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons, without &s;hut|ting its doors to any merit in any cla&s;s, is, by the &s;ure opera|tion of adequate cau&s;es filled with every thing illu&s;trious in rank, in de&s;cent, in hereditary and in acquired opulence, in cultivated talents, in military, civil, naval, and politic di|&s;tinction, that the country can afford. But &s;uppo&s;ing, what hardly can be &s;uppo&s;ed as a ca&s;e, that the hou&s;e of commons &s;hould be compo&s;ed in the &s;ame manner with the Tiers Etat in France, would this dominion of chicane be borne with patience, or even conceived without horror? God forbid I &s;hould in&s;inuate any thing derogatory to that profe&s;&s;ion, which is another prie&s;thood, admini&s;tering the rites of &s;acred ju&s;tice. But whil&s;t I revere men in the functions which belong to them, and would do, as much as one man can do, to prevent their exclu&s;ion from any, I cannot, to flatter them, give the lye to nature. They are good and u&s;eful in the compo&s;ition; they mu&s;t be mi&s;chievous if they preponderate &s;o as virtually to become the whole. Their very excellence in their peculiar functions may
<PB N="35" REF="023238_0037_0FBED2CEA4B9EAA0">
be far from a qualification for others. It cannot e&s;cape ob&s;er|vation, that when men are too much confined to profe&s;&s;ional and faculty habits, and, as it were, inveterate in the recurrent employment of that narrow circle, they are rather di&s;abled than qualified for whatever depends on the knowledge of man|kind, on experience in mixed affairs, on a comprehen&s;ive connected view of the various complicated external and internal intere&s;ts which go to the formation of that multifarious thing called a &s;tate?</P>
<P>After all, if the hou&s;e of commons were to have an wholly profe&s;&s;ional and faculty compo&s;ition, what is the power of the hou&s;e of commons, circum&s;cribed and &s;hut in by the immove|able barriers of Laws, u&s;ages, po&s;itive rules of doctrine and practice, counterpoized by the hou&s;e of lords, and every mo|ment of its exi&s;tence at the di&s;cretion of the crown to continue, prorogue, or di&s;&s;olve us? The power of the hou&s;e of commons, direct or indirect, is indeed great; and long may it be able to pre&s;erve its greatne&s;s, and the &s;pirit belonging to true greatne&s;s, at the full; and it will do &s;o, as long as it can keep the break|ers of law in India from becoming the makers of law for England. The power, however, of the hou&s;e of commons, when lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, is as a drop of water in the ocean, compared to that re&s;iding in a &s;ettled majority of your National A&s;&s;embly. That A&s;&s;embly, &s;ince the de&s;truction of the orders; has no fundamental law, no &s;trict convention, no re&s;pected u&s;age to re&s;train it. In&s;tead of finding them&s;elves obliged to conform to a fixed con&s;titution, they have a power to make a con&s;titution which &s;hall conform to their de&s;igns. Nothing in heaven or upon earth can &s;erve as a control on them. What ought to be the heads, the hearts, the di&s;po&s;itions, that are qualified, or that dare, not only to make laws under a fixed con&s;titution, but at one heat to &s;trike out a totally new con&s;titu|tion for a great kingdom, and in every part of it, from the monarch on the throne to the ve&s;try of a pari&s;h? But&mdash;<Q>fools ru&s;h in where angels fear to tread.</Q> In &s;uch a &s;tate of un|bounded power, for undefined and undefinable purpo&s;es, the evil of a moral and almo&s;t phy&s;ical inaptitude of the man to the function mu&s;t be the greate&s;t we can conceive to happen in the management of human affairs.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the compo&s;ition of the third e&s;tate as it &s;tood in its original frame, I took a view of the repre&s;entatives of the clergy. There too it appeared, that full as little regard was had to the general &s;ecurity of property, or to the aptitude of the deputies for their public purpo&s;es, in the principles of their Election. That election was &s;o contrived as to &s;end a very large proportion of mere country curates to the great and
<PB N="36" REF="023238_0038_0FBED2D02323B658" MS="y">
arduous work of new-modelling a &s;tate; men who never had &s;een the &s;tate &s;o much as in a picture; men who knew nothing of the world beyond the bounds of an ob&s;cure village; who, immer&s;ed in hopele&s;s poverty, could regard all property, whe|ther &s;ecular or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, with no other eye than that of envy; among whom mu&s;t be many, who for the &s;malle&s;t hope of the meane&s;t dividend in plunder, would readily join in any attempts upon a body of wealth, in which they could hardly look to have any &s;hare, except in a general &s;cramble. In&s;tead of balancing the power of the active chicaners in the other a&s;&s;embly, the&s;e curates mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become the active coadjutors, or at be&s;t the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of tho&s;e with whom they had been habitually guided in their petty village concerns. They too could hardly be the mo&s;t con&s;cientious of their kind, who, pre&s;uming upon their incompetent under|&s;tanding, could intrigue for a tru&s;t which led them from their natural relation to their &s;tocks, and their natural &s;pheres of action, to undertake the regeneration of kingdoms. This preponderating weight being added to the force of the body chicane in the Tiers Etat, compleated that momentum of ignorance, ra&s;hne&s;s, pre&s;umption, and lu&s;t of plunder, which nothing has been able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>To ob&s;erving men it mu&s;t have appeared from the beginning, that the majority of the Third E&s;tate, in conjunction with &s;uch a deputation from the clergy as I have de&s;cribed, whil&s;t it pur|&s;ued the de&s;truction of the nobility, would inevitably become &s;ub&s;ervient to the wor&s;t de&s;igns of individuals in that cla&s;s. In the &s;poil and humiliation of their own order the&s;e individuals would po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ure fund for the pay of their new followers. To &s;quander away the objects which made the happine&s;s of their fellows, would be to them no &s;acrifice at all. Turbulent, di&s;|contented men of quality, in proportion as they are puffed up with per&s;onal pride and arrogance, generally di&s;pi&s;e their own order. One of the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms they di&s;cover of a &s;elfi&s;h and mi&s;chievous ambition, is a profligate di&s;regard of a dignity which they partake with others. To be attatched to the &s;ub|divi&s;ion, to love the little platoon we belong to in &s;ociety, is the fir&s;t principle (the germ as it were) of public affections. It is the fir&s;t link in the &s;eries by which we proceed towards a love to our country and to mankind. The intere&s;ts of that portion of &s;ocial arrangment is a tru&s;t in the hands of all tho&s;e who compo&s;e it; and as none but bad men would ju&s;tify it in abu&s;e, none but traitors would barter it away for their own per&s;onal advantage.</P>
<P>There were, in the time of our civil troubles in England (I do not know whether you have any &s;uch in your A&s;&s;embly in
<PB N="37" REF="023238_0039_0FBED2D1A3C96C38" MS="y">
France) &s;everal per&s;ons, like the then Earl of Holland, who by them&s;elves or their families had brought an odium on the throne, by the prodigal di&s;pentation of its bounties towards them, who afterwards joined in the rebellions ari&s;ing from the di&s;contents of which they were them&s;elves the cau&s;e; men who helped to &s;ubvert that throne to which they owed, &s;ome of them, their exi&s;tence, others all that power which they employed to ruin their benefactor. It any bounds are &s;et to the rapacious demands of that &s;ort of people, or that others are permitted to partake in the objects they would engro&s;s, revenge and envy &s;oon fill up the craving void that is left in their avarice. Con|founded by the complication of di&s;tempered pa&s;&s;ions, their rea|&s;on is di&s;turbed; their views become va&s;t and perplexed; to others inexplicable; to them&s;elves uncertain. They find, on all &s;ides, bounds to their unprincipled ambition in any fixed order of things. But in the fog and haze of confu&s;ion all is en|larged, and appears without any limit.</P>
<P>When men of rank &s;acrifice all ideas of dignity to an am|bition without a di&s;tinct object, and work with low in&s;truments and for low ends, the whole compo&s;ition becomes low and ba&s;e. Does not &s;omething like this now appear in France? Does it not produce &s;omething ignoble and inglorious? a kind of mean|ne&s;s in all the prevalent policy? a tendency in all that is done to lower along with individuals all the dignity and importance of the &s;tate? Other revolutions have been conducted by per&s;ons, who whil&s;t they attempted or effected changes in the common|wealth, &s;anctified their ambition by advancing the dignity of the people who&s;e peace they troubled. They had long views. They aimed at the rule, not at the de&s;truction of their country. They were men of great civil, and great military talents, and if the terror, the ornament of their age. They were not like Jew brokers contending with each other who could be&s;t remedy with fraudulent circulation and depreciated paper the wretch|edne&s;s and ruin brought on their country by their degenerate councils. The compliment made to one of the great bad men of the old &s;tamp (Cromwell) by his kin&s;man, a favourite poet of that time, &s;hews what it was he propo&s;ed, and what indeed to a great degree he accompli&s;hed in the &s;ucce&s;s of his ambition:
<Q><L>"Still as <HI>you</HI> ri&s;e, the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> exalted too,</L>
<L>"Finds no di&s;temper whil&s;t 'tis chang'd by <HI>you;</HI></L>

<P>The&s;e di&s;turbers were not &s;o much like men u&s;urping power, as a&s;&s;erting their natural place in &s;ociety. Their ri&s;ing was to
<PB N="38" REF="023238_0040_0FBED2D31F9F0050">
illuminate and beautify the world. Their conque&s;t over their competitors was by out&s;hining them. The hand that, like a de&s;troying angel, &s;mote the country, communicated it to the force and energy under which it &s;uffered. I do not &s;ay (God forbid) I do not &s;ay, that the virtues of &s;uch men were to be taken as a balance to their crimes; but they were &s;ome correct|ive to their effects. Such was, as I &s;aid, our Cromwell. Such were your whole race of Gui&s;es, Condes, and Colignis. Such the Richlieus, who in more quiet times acted in the &s;pirit of a civil war. Such, as better men, and in a le&s;s dubious cau&s;e, were your Henry the 4th and your Sully, though nur&s;ed in civil confu&s;ions, and not wholly without &s;ome of their taint. It is a thing to be wondered at, to &s;ee how very &s;oon France, when &s;he had a moment to re&s;pire, recovered and immerged from the longe&s;t and mo&s;t dreadful civil war that ever was known in any nation. Why? Becau&s;e, among all their ma&s;&s;acres, they had not &s;lain the <HI>mind</HI> in their country. A con&s;cious dignity, a noble pride, a generous &s;en&s;e of glory and emulation, was not extingui&s;hed. On the contrary, it was kindled and inflamed. The organs al&s;o of the &s;tate, however &s;hattered, exi&s;ted. All the prizes of ho|nour and virtue, all the rewards, all the di&s;tinctions, remained. But your pre&s;ent confu&s;ion, like a pal&s;y, has attacked the foun|tain of life it&s;elf. Every per&s;on in your country, in a &s;ituation to be actuated by a principle of honour, is di&s;graced and degraded, and can entertain no &s;en&s;ation of life, except in a mortified and humiliated indignation. But this generation will quickly pa&s;s away. The next generation of the nobility will re&s;emble the artificers and clowns, and money-jobbers, u&s;erers, and Jews, who will be always their fellows, &s;ometimes their ma&s;ters. Believe me, Sir, tho&s;e who attempt to level, never equalize. In all &s;ocieties, con&s;i&s;ting of various de&s;criptions of citizens, &s;ome de&s;cription mu&s;t be uppermo&s;t. The levellers therefore only change and pervert the natural order of things; they load the edifice of &s;ociety, by &s;etting up in air what the &s;olidity of the &s;tructure requires to be on the ground. The a&s;&s;ociations of taylors and carpenters, of which the republic (of Paris, for in&s;tance) is compo&s;ed, cannot be equal to the &s;ituation, into which, by the wor&s;t of u&s;urpations, an u&s;urpation on the prerogatives of nature, you attempt to force them.</P>

<P>I do not, my dear Sir, conceive you to be of that &s;ophi&s;tical captious &s;pirit, or of that uncandid dulne&s;s, as to require, for every general ob&s;ervation or &s;entiment, an explicit detail of all the correctives and exceptions, which rea&s;on will pre&s;ume to be included in all the general propo&s;itions which come from rea|&s;onable men. You do not imagine, that I wi&s;h to confine power, authority, and di&s;tinction, to blood, and names, and titles. No, Sir. There is no qualification for government, but virtue and wi&s;dom, actual or pre&s;umptive. Wherever they are actually found, they have, in whatever &s;tate, profe&s;&s;ion or trade, the pa&s;&s;port of Heaven to human place and honour.

Every thing ought to be open; but not indifferently to every man. No rotation; no appointment by lot; no mode of election operating in the &s;pirit of &s;ortition or rotation, can be generally good in a government conver&s;ant in exten&s;ive objects. Becau&s;e they have no tendency, direct or indirect, to fit the man to the duty. I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that the road to eminence and power, from ob&s;cure con|dition, ought not to be made too ea&s;y, nor a thing too much of cour&s;e.

ought to be &s;eated on an eminence. If it be open through virtue, let it be remembered too, that virtue is never tried but by &s;ome difficulty, and &s;ome &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Nothing is a due and adequate repre&s;entation of a &s;tate, that does not repre&s;ent its ability, as well as its property. But as ability is a vigorous and active principle, and as pro|perty is &s;luggi&s;h, inert, and timid, it never can be &s;afe from the inva&s;ions of ability, unle&s;s it be, out of all proportion, predominant in the repre&s;entation It mu&s;t be repre&s;ented too in great ma&s;&s;es of accumulation, or it is not rightly protected. The characteri&s;tic e&s;&s;ence of property, formed out of the com|bined principles of its acqui&s;ition and conver&s;ation, is to be <HI>uneaqual.</HI> The great ma&s;&s;es therefore which excite envy, and tempt rapacity, mu&s;t be put out of the po&s;&s;ibility of danger. Then they form a natural rampart about the le&s;&s;er properties in all their gradations. The &s;ame quantity of property, which is by the natural cour&s;e of things, divided among many, has not the &s;ame operation. Its defen&s;ive power is weakened as it is diffu&s;ed.

<P>The perpetuation of property in our families is the mo&s;t valuable and mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum&s;tance attending it, that which demon&s;trates mo&s;t of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition in its owners, and that which tends mo&s;t to the perpetuation of &s;ociety it&s;elf. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of family wealth, and of the di&s;tinction which attends hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (as mo&s;t concerned in it) are the natural &s;ecurities for this tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion. With us, the hou&s;e of peers is formed upon this principle. It is wholly compo&s;ed of hereditary property and hereditary di&s;tinction; and made therefore the third of the legi&s;lature; and in the la&s;t event, the &s;ole judge of all property in all its &s;ubdivi&s;ions. The hou&s;e of commons too, though not nece&s;&s;arily, yet in fact, is always &s;o compo&s;ed in the far greater part. Let tho&s;e large proprietors be what they will, and they have their chance of being among&s;t the be&s;t, they are at the very wor&s;t, the balla&s;t in the ve&s;&s;el of the commonwealth. For though hereditary wealth, and the rank which goes with it, are too much idolized by creeping &s;ycophants, and the blind abject admirers of power, they are too ra&s;hly &s;lighted in &s;hallow &s;peculations of the petulent, a&s;&s;uming, &s;hort-&s;ighted coxcombs of philo&s;ophy. Some decent regulated pre-eminence, &s;ome preference (not

exclu&s;ive appropriation) given to birth, is neither unnatural, nor unju&s;t, nor impolitic.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred thou&s;and. True; if the con&s;titution of a king|dom be a problem of arithmetic. This &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e does well enough with the lamp-po&s;t for its &s;econd: to men who <HI>may</HI> rea&s;on calmly, it is ridiculous. The will of the many, and their intere&s;t, mu&s;t very often differ; and great will be the difference when they make an evil choice. A government of five hundred country attornies and ob&s;cure curates is not good for twenty-four millions of men, though it were cho&s;en by eight and forty millions; nor is it the better for being guided by a dozen of per&s;ons of quality, who have betrayed their tru&s;t in order to obtain that power. At pre&s;ent, you &s;eem in every thing to have &s;trayed out of the high road of nature. The property of France does not govern it. Of cour&s;e pro|perty is de&s;troyed; and rational liberty has no exi&s;tence. All you have got for the pre&s;ent is a paper circulation, and a &s;tock-jobbing con&s;titution: and as to the future, do you &s;eriou&s;ly think that the territory of France, upon the republican &s;y&s;tem of eighty-three independent municipalities, (to &s;ay nothing of the parts that compo&s;e them) can ever be governed as one body, or can ever be &s;et in motion by the impul&s;e of one mind? When the National A&s;&s;embly has compleated its work, it will have accompli&s;hed its ruin. The&s;e commonwealths will not long bear a &s;tate of &s;ubjection to the republic of Paris. They will not bear that this one body &s;hould monopolize the captivity of the king, and the dominion over the A&s;&s;embly calling it&s;elf National. Each will keep its own portion of the &s;poil of the church to it&s;elf; and it will not &s;uffer either that &s;poil, or the more ju&s;t fruits of their indu&s;try, or the natural produce of their &s;oil, to be &s;ent to &s;well the in&s;olence, or pamper the lux|ury of the mechanics of Paris. In this they will &s;ee none of the equality, under the pretence of which they have been tempted to throw off their allegiance to their &s;overeign, as well as the antient con&s;titution of their country. There can be no capital city in &s;uch a con&s;titution as they have lately made. They have forgot, that when they framed democratic govern|ments, they had virtually di&s;membered their country. The per&s;on whom they per&s;evere in calling king, has not power left to him by the hundredth part &s;ufficient to hold together this collection of republics. The republic of Paris will endea|vour indeed to compleat the debauchery of the army, and illegally to perpetuate the a&s;&s;embly, without re&s;ort to its con|&s;tituents, as the means of continuing its di&s;poti&s;m. It will make efforts, by becoming the heart of a boundle&s;s paper cir|culation,
<PB N="42" REF="023238_0044_0FBED2E009712128">
to draw every thing to it&s;elf; but in vain. All this policy in the end will appear as feeble as it is now violent.</P>
<P>If this be your actual &s;ituation, compared to the &s;ituation to which you were called, as it were by the voice of God and man, I cannot find it in my heart to congratulate you on the choice you have made, or the &s;ucce&s;s which has attended your endea|vours. I can as little recommend to any other nation a conduct grounded on &s;uch principles, and productive of &s;uch effects. That I mu&s;t leave to tho&s;e who can &s;ee further into your affairs than I am able to do, and who be&s;t know how far your actions are favourable to their de&s;igns. The gentlemen of the Revo|lution Society, who were &s;o early in their congratulations, ap|pear to be &s;trongly of opinion that there is &s;ome &s;cheme of poli|tics relative to this country, in which your proceedings may, in &s;ome way, be u&s;eful. For your Dr. Price, who &s;eems to have &s;peculated him&s;elf into no &s;mall degree of fervour upon this &s;ubject, addre&s;&s;es his auditory in the following very re|markable words: <Q>I cannot conclude without recalling <HI>parti|cularly</HI> to your recollection a con&s;ideration which I have <HI>more than once alluded to,</HI> and which probably your thoughts have <HI>been all along anticipating;</HI> a con&s;ideration with which my <HI>mind is impre&s;&s;ed more than I can expre&s;s.</HI> I mean the con&s;i|deration of the <HI>favourablene&s;s of the pre&s;ent times to all exerti|ons in the cau&s;e of liberty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is plain that the mind of this <HI>political</HI> Preacher was at the time big with &s;ome extraordinary de&s;ign; and it is very pro|bable, that the thoughts of his audience, who under&s;tood him better than I do, did all along run before him in his reflection, and in the whole train of con&s;equences to which it led.</P>
<P>Before I read that &s;ermon, I really thought I had lived in a free country; and it was an error I cheri&s;hed, becau&s;e it gave me a greater liking to the country I lived in. I was indeed aware, that a jealous, ever-waking vigilance, to guard the trea&s;ure of our liberty, not only from inva&s;ion, but from decay and corruption, was our be&s;t wi&s;dom and our fir&s;t duty. How|ever, I con&s;idered that trea&s;ure rather as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to be &s;e|cured than as a prize to be contended for. I did not di&s;cern how the pre&s;ent time came to be &s;o very favourable to all <HI>exer|tions</HI> in the cau&s;e of freedom. The pre&s;ent time differs from any other only by the circum&s;tance of what is doing in France. If the example of that nation is to have an influence on this, I can ea&s;ily conceive why &s;ome of their proceedings which have an unplea&s;ant a&s;pect, and are not quite reconcileable to huma|nity, genero&s;ity, good faith, and ju&s;tice, are palliated with &s;o much milky good-nature towards the actors, and borne with &s;o much heroic fortitude towards the &s;ufferers. It is certainly
<PB N="43" REF="023238_0045_0FBED2E1692EE090" MS="y">
not prudent to di&s;credit the authority of an example we mean to follow. But allowing this, we are led to a very natural que&s;tion;&mdash;What is that cau&s;e of liberty, and what are tho&s;e exertions in its favour, to which the example of France is &s;o &s;ingularly au&s;picious? Is our monarchy to be annihilated, with all the laws, all the tribunals, and all the antient corporati|ons of the kingdom? Is every land-mark of the country to be done away in favour of a geometrical and arithmetical con&s;ti|tution! Is the hou&s;e of lords to be voted u&s;ele&s;s? Is epi&s;copacy to be aboli&s;hed? Are the church lands to be &s;old to Jews and jobbers; or given to bribe new-invented municipal republics into a participation in &s;acrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances, and the revenue reduced to a patriotic contributi|on, or patriotic pre&s;ents? Are &s;ilver &s;hoe-buckles to be &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in the place of the land tax and the malt tax, for the &s;upport of the naval &s;trength of this kingdom? Are all orders, ranks, and di&s;tinctions to be confounded, that out of univer&s;al anarchy, joined to national bankruptcy, three or four thou&s;and democracies &s;hould be formed into eighty-three, and that they may all, by &s;ome &s;ort of unknown attractive power, be orga|nized into one? For this great end, is the army to be &s;edu|ced from its di&s;cipline and its fidelity, fir&s;t, by every kind of debauchery, and then by the terrible precedent of a dona|tive in the encrea&s;e of pay? Are the curates to be &s;educed from their bi&s;hops, by holding out to them the delu&s;ive hope of a dole out of the &s;poils of their own order? Are the citizens of London to be drawn from their allegiance, by feeding them at the expence of their fellow-&s;ubjects? Are all the public re|venues levied in their city to be put under their admini&s;trati|on? Is what remains of the plundered &s;tock of public revenue to be employed in the wild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with each other?&mdash;If the&s;e are the ends and means of the Revolution Society, I admit they are well adapted to each other; and France may furni&s;h them for both with precedents in point.</P>
<P>I &s;ee that your example is held out to &s;hame us. I know that we are &s;uppo&s;ed a dull &s;luggi&s;h race, rendered pa&s;&s;ive by finding our &s;ituation tolerable; and prevented by a mediocrity of freedom from ever attaining to its full perfection. Your leaders in France began by affecting to admire, almo&s;t to adore, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; But as they advanced they came to look upon it with a &s;overeign contempt. The friends of your National A&s;&s;embly among&s;t us have full as mean an opinion of what was formerly thought the glory of their country.

<P>You will &s;mile here at the con&s;i&s;tency of tho&s;e democrati&s;ts, who, when they are not on their guard, treat the humbler part of the community with the greate&s;t contempt, whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, they pretend to make them the depo&s;itories of all power. It would require a long di&s;cour&s;e to point out to you the many fallacies that lurk in the generality and equivocal nature of the terms "inadequate repre&s;entation." I &s;hall only &s;ay here, in ju&s;tice to that old-fa&s;hioned con&s;titution, under which we have long pro&s;pered, that our repre&s;entation has been found perfectly adequate to all the purpo&s;es for which a repre&s;entation of the people can be de&s;ired or devi&s;ed. I defy the enemies of our con&s;titution to &s;hew the contrary. To detail the particulars in which it is found &s;o well to promote its ends, would demand a treati&s;e on our practical con&s;titution. I &s;tate here the doctrine of the Revolutioni&s;ts, only that you and others may &s;ee, what an opinion the&s;e gentlemen entertain of the con&s;titution of their country, and why they &s;eem to think that &s;ome great abu&s;e of power, or &s;ome great calamity, as giving a chance for the ble&s;&s;ing of a con&s;titution according to their ideas, would be much palliated to their feelings; you &s;ee <HI>why they</HI> are &s;o much enamoured of your fair and equal repre&s;enta|tion, which being once obtained, the &s;ame effects might follow. You &s;ee they con&s;ider our hou&s;e of commons as only "a &s;em|blance," "a form," "a theory," "a &s;hadow," "a mockery," perhaps "a nui&s;ance."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="023238_0047_0FBED2E5E4718B48">The&s;e gentlemen value them&s;elves on being &s;y&s;tematic; and not without rea&s;on.

Indeed their principle, if you ob&s;erve it with any attention, goes much further than to an alteration in the election of the hou&s;e of commons; for, if popular repre&s;enta|tion, or choice, is nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>legitimacy</HI> of all government, the hou&s;e of lords is, at one &s;troke, ba&s;tardized and corrupted in blood.

The Revolution which is re&s;orted to for a title, on their &s;y&s;tem, wants a title it&s;elf. The Revolution is built, according to their theory, upon a ba&s;is not more &s;olid than our pre&s;ent formalities, as it was made by an hou&s;e of lords not repre&s;enting any one but them&s;elves; and by an hou&s;e of commons exactly &s;uch as the pre&s;ent, that is, as they term it, by a mere "&s;hadow and mockery" of repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>Some of them are &s;o heated with their particular religious theories, that they give more than hints that the fall of the civil powers, with all the dreadful con&s;equences of that fall, provided they might be of &s;ervice to their theories, would not be unacceptable to them or very remote from their wi&s;hes. A man among&s;t them of great authority, and certainly of great talents, &s;peaking of a &s;uppo&s;ed alliance between church and &s;tate, &s;ays, <Q>perhaps <HI>we mu&s;t wait for the fall of the civil powers</HI> before this mo&s;t unnatural alliance be broken.

<P>It is no wonder therefore, that with the&s;e ideas of every thing in their con&s;titution and government at home, either in church or &s;tate, as illegitimate and u&s;urped, or, at be&s;t as a vain mock|ery, they look abroad with an eagar and pa&s;&s;ionate enthu&s;ia&s;m.

are confirmed by the &s;olid te&s;t of long experience, and an in|crea&s;ing publick &s;trength and national pro&s;perity. They de&s;|pi&s;e experience as the wi&s;dom of unlettered men; and as for the re&s;t, they have wrought under-ground a mine that will blow up at one grand explo&s;ion all examples of antiquity, all precedents, charters, and acts of parliament. They have "the rights of men." Again&s;t the&s;e there can be no pre&s;crip|tion; again&s;t the&s;e no agreement is binding: the&s;e admit no temperament, and no compromi&s;e: any thing withheld from their full demand is &s;o much of fraud and inju&s;tice. Again&s;t the&s;e their rights of men let no government look for &s;ecurity in the length of its continuance, or in the ju&s;tice and lenity of its admini&s;tration. The objections of the&s;e &s;peculati&s;ts, if its forms do not quadrate with their theories, are as valid again&s;t &s;uch an old and beneficent government as again&s;t the mo&s;t vio|lent tyranny, or the greene&s;t u&s;urpation. They are always at i&s;&s;ue with the governments, not on a que&s;tion of abu&s;e, but a que&s;tion of competency, and a que&s;tion of title.

<P>Far am I from denying in theory; full as far is my heart from withholding in practice (if I were of power to give or to withhold) the <HI>real</HI> rights of men. In denying their fal&s;e claims of right, I do not mean to injure tho&s;e which are real, and are &s;uch as their pretended rights would totally de&s;troy. If civil &s;ociety be made for the advantage of man, all the advantages for which it is made become his right. It is an in&s;titution of beneficence; and law it&s;elf is only beneficence acting by a rule. Men have a right to live by that rule; they have a right to ju&s;tice; as between their fellows, whether their fellows, are in politic function or in ordinary occupation. They have a right to the fruits of their indu&s;try; and to the means of making their indu&s;try fruitful. They have a right to the acqui&s;itions of their parents; to the nouri&s;hment and improvement of their offspring; to in&s;truction in life, and to con&s;olation in death. Whatever each man can &s;eparately do, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon others, he has a right to do for him&s;elf; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which &s;ociety, with all its combinations of &s;kill and force, can do in his favour. But as to the &s;hare of power, authority, and direction which each individual ought to have in the management of the &s;tate, that I mu&s;t deny to be among&s;t the direct original rights of man in civil &s;ociety; for
<PB N="47" REF="023238_0049_0FBED4ACA09F0360">
I have in my contemplation the civil &s;ocial man, and no other. It is a thing to be &s;ettled by convention.</P>
<P>If civil &s;ociety be the offspring of convention, that conven|tion mu&s;t be its law. That convention mu&s;t limit and modify all the de&s;criptions of con&s;titution which are formed under it. Every &s;ort of legi&s;lative, judicial, or executory power are its creatures. They can have no being in any other &s;tate of things; and how can any man claim, under the conventions of civil &s;ociety, rights which do not &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;e its exi&s;tence? Rights which are ab&s;olutely repugnant to it? One of the fir&s;t motives to civil &s;ociety, and which becomes one of its funda|mental rules, is, <HI>that no man &s;hould be judge in his own cau&s;e.</HI> By this each per&s;on has at once dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the fir&s;t fun|damental right of uncovenanted man, that is, to judge for him&s;elf, and to a&s;&s;ert his own cau&s;e. He abdicates all right to be his own governor. He inclu&s;ively, in a great mea&s;ure, abandons the right of &s;elf-defence, the fir&s;t law of nature. Men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil &s;tate toge|ther. That he may obtain ju&s;tice he gives up his right of determining what it is in points the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to him. That he may &s;ecure &s;ome liberty, he makes a &s;urrender in tru&s;t of the whole of it.</P>
<P>Government is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exi&s;t in total independence of it; and exi&s;t in much greater clearne&s;s, and in a much greater degree of ab&s;tract perfection; but their ab&s;tract perfection is their practical defect. By having a right to every thing they want every thing. Go|vernment is a contrivance of human wi&s;dom to provide for hu|man <HI>wants.</HI> Men have a right that the&s;e wants &s;hould be pro|vided for by this wi&s;dom. Among the&s;e wants is to be reckon|ed the want, out of civil &s;ociety, of a &s;ufficient re&s;traint upon their pa&s;&s;ions. Society requires not only that the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals &s;hould be &s;ubjected, but that even in the ma&s;s and body as well as in the individuals, the inclinations of men &s;hould frequently be thwarted, their will controlled, and their pa&s;&s;ions brought into &s;ubjection. This can only be done <HI>by a power out of them&s;elves;</HI> and not, in the exerci&s;e of its function, &s;ubject to that will and to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it is its office to bridle and &s;ubdue. In this &s;en&s;e the re&s;traints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights. But as the liberties and the re&s;trictions vary with times and circum|&s;tances, and admit of infinite modifications, they cannot be &s;ettled upon any ab&s;tract rule; and nothing is &s;o fooli&s;h as to di&s;cu&s;s them upon that principle.</P>
<P>The moment you abate any thing from the full rights of men, each to govern him&s;elf, and &s;uffer any artificial po&s;itive limi|tation
<PB N="48" REF="023238_0050_0FBED4AEA6588B28">
upon tho&s;e rights, from that moment the whole organi|zation of government becomes a con&s;ideration of convenience. This it is which makes the con&s;titution of a &s;tate, and the due di&s;tribution of its powers, a matter of the mo&s;t delicate and complicated &s;kill. It requires a deep knowledge of human nature and human nece&s;&s;ities, and of the things which facili|tate or ob&s;truct the various ends which are to be pur&s;ued by the mechani&s;m of civil in&s;titutions. The &s;tate is to have recruits to its &s;trength, and remedies to its di&s;tempers. What is the u&s;e of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a man's ab&s;tract right to food or to medicine? The que&s;tion is upon the method of procuring and admini&s;ter|ing them. In that deliberation I &s;hall always advi&s;e to call in the aid of the farmer and the phy&s;ician, rather than the pro|fe&s;&s;or of metaphy&s;ics. The &s;cience of con&s;tructing a common|wealth, or renovating it, or reforming it, is, like every other experimental &s;cience, not to be taught <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI> Nor is it a &s;hort experience that can in&s;truct us in that practical &s;cience; becau&s;e the real effects of moral cau&s;es are not always immedi|ate; but that which in the fir&s;t in&s;tance is prejudicial may be excellent in its remoter operation; and its excellence may ari&s;e even from the ill effects it produces in the beginning. The rever&s;e al&s;o happens; and very plau&s;ible &s;chemes, with very plea&s;ing commencements, have often &s;hameful and la|mentable conclu&s;ions. In &s;tates there are often &s;ome ob&s;cure and almo&s;t latent cau&s;es, things which appear at fir&s;t view of little moment, on which a very great part of its pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity may mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially depend. The &s;cience of govern|ment being therefore &s;o practical in it&s;elf, and intended for &s;uch practical purpo&s;es, a matter which requires experience, and even more experience than any per&s;on can gain in his whole life, however &s;agacious and ob&s;erving he may be, it is with infinite caution that any man ought to venture upon pull|ing down an edifice which has an&s;wered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purpo&s;es of &s;ociety, or of building it up again, without having models and patterns of approved utility before his eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e metaphy&s;ic rights entering into common life, like rays of light which pierce into a den&s;e medium, are, by the laws of nature, refracted from their &s;traight line. Indeed in the gro&s;s and complicated ma&s;s of human pa&s;&s;ions and concerns, the primitive rights of men undergo &s;uch a variety of refrac|tions and reflections, that it becomes ab&s;urd to talk of them as if they continued in the &s;implicity of their original direction. The nature of man is intricate; the objects of &s;ociety are of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible complexity; and therefore no &s;imple di&s;|po&s;ition or direction of power can be &s;uitable either to man's

nature, or to the quality of his affairs. When I hear the &s;implicity of contrivance aimed at and boa&s;ted of in any new political con&s;titutions, I am at no lo&s;s to decide that the artifi|cers are gro&s;sly ignorant of their trade, or totally negligent of their duty. The &s;imple governments are fundamentally de|fective, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them. If you were to contemplate &s;ociety in but one point of view, all the&s;e &s;imple modes of polity are infinitely captivating. In effect each would an&s;wer its &s;ingle end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain all its complex purpo&s;es. But it is better that the whole &s;hould be imperfectly and anomalou&s;ly an&s;wered, than that, while &s;ome parts are provided for with great exactne&s;s, others might be totally neglected, or perhaps materially in|jured, by the over-care of a favourite member.</P>
<P>The pretended rights of the&s;e theori&s;ts are all extremes; and in proportion as they are metaphy&s;ically true, they are morally and politically fal&s;e. The rights of men are in a &s;ort of <HI>middle,</HI> incapable of definition. But not impo&s;&s;ible to be di&s;cerned. The rights of men in governments are their advantages; and the&s;e are often in balances between differ|ences of good; in compromi&s;es &s;ometimes between good and evil, and &s;ometimes, between evil and evil. Political rea&s;on is a computing principle; adding, &s;ubtracting, multiplying, and dividing, morally and not metaphy&s;ically or mathemati|cally, true moral denominations.</P>
<P>By the&s;e theori&s;ts the right of the people is almo&s;t always &s;ophi&s;tically confounded with their power. The body of the community, whenever it can come to act, can meet with no effectual re&s;i&s;tance; but till power and right are the &s;ame, the whole body of them has no right incon&s;i&s;tent with virtue, and the fir&s;t of all virtues, prudence. Men have no right to what is not rea&s;onable, and to what is not for their benefit; for though a plea&s;ant writer &s;aid, <HI>Liceat perire poetis,</HI> when one of them, in cold blood, is &s;aid to have leaped into the flames of a vulcanic revolution, <HI>Ardentem frigidus Aetnam in&s;iluit,</HI> I con|&s;ider &s;uch a frolic rather as an unju&s;tifiable poetic licence, than as one of the franchi&s;es of Parna&s;&s;us; and whether he were poet or divine, or politician that cho&s;e to exerci&s;e this kind of right, I think that more wi&s;e, becau&s;e more charitable thoughts would-urge me rather to &s;ave the man, than to pre&s;erve his brazen &s;lippers as the monuments of his folly.</P>
<P>The kind of anniver&s;ary &s;ermons, to which a great part of what I write refers, if men are not a&s;hamed out of their pre|&s;ent cour&s;e, in commemorating the fact, will cheat many out of the principles, and deprive them of the benefits of the Revolution they commemorate. I confe&s;s to you, Sir, I never

liked this continual talk of re&s;i&s;tance and revolution, or the practice of making the extreme medicine of the con&s;titution its daily bread. It renders the habit of &s;ociety dangerou&s;ly valetudinary: it is taking periodical do&s;es of mercury &s;ublimate, and &s;wallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides to the love of liberty.</P>
<P>This di&s;temper of remedy, grown habitual, relaxes and wears out, by a vulgar and pro&s;tituted u&s;e, the &s;pring of that &s;pirit which is to be exerted on great occa&s;ions. It was in the mo&s;t patient period of Roman &s;ervitude that themes of tyrannicide made the ordinary exerci&s;e of boys at &s;chool&mdash;<HI>cum perimit &s;aevos cl&agrave;&s;&s;is numero&s;a tyrannos.</HI> In the ordinary &s;tate of things, it pro|duces in a country like ours the wor&s;t effects, even on the cau&s;e of that liberty which it abu&s;es with the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of an ex|travagant &s;peculation. Almo&s;t all the high-bred republicans of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, have, after a &s;hort &s;pace, become the mo&s;t decided, thorough-paced courtiers; they &s;oon left the bu&s;ine&s;s of a tedious moderate, but practical re&s;i&s;tance, to tho&s;e of us whom, in the pride and intoxication of their theories, they have &s;lighted, as not much better than tories. Hypocri&s;y, of cour&s;e, delights in the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;peculations; for never intending to go be|yond &s;peculation, it co&s;ts nothing to have it magnificent. But even in ca&s;es where rather levity than fraud was to be &s;u&s;pected in the&s;e ranting &s;peculations, the i&s;&s;ue has been much the &s;ame. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, finding their extreme principles not applicable to ca&s;es which call only for a qualified, or, as I may &s;ay, civil and legal re&s;i&s;tance, in &s;uch ca&s;es employ no re&s;i&s;tance at all. It is with them a war or a revolution, or it is nothing. Find|ing their &s;chemes of politics not adapted to the &s;tate of the world in which they live, they often come to think lighty of all public principle; and are ready, on their part, to abandon for a very trivial intere&s;t what they find of very trivial value. Some indeed are of more &s;teady and per&s;evering natures; but the&s;e are eager politicians out of parliament, who have little to tempt them to abandon their favourite projects. They have &s;ome change in the church or &s;tate, or both, con&s;tantly in their view. When that is the ca&s;e, they are always bad citizens, and perfectly and un&s;ure connections. For, con&s;idering their &s;peculative de&s;igns as of infinite value, and the actual arrange|ment of the &s;tate as of no e&s;timation, they are at be&s;t indifferent about it. They &s;ee no merit in the good, and no fault in the vicious management of public affairs; they rather rejoice in the latter, as more propitious to revolution. They &s;ee no me|rit or demerit in any man, or any action, or any political prin|ciple, any further than as they may forward or retard their de|&s;ign of change: they therefore take up, one day, the mo&s;t

violent and &s;tretched prerogative, and another time the wilde&s;t democratic ideas of freedom, and pa&s;s from the one to the other without any &s;ort of regard to cau&s;e, to per&s;on, or to party.</P>
<P>In France you are now in the cri&s;is of a revolution, and in the tran&s;it from one form of government to another&mdash;you can|not &s;ee that character of men exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation in which we &s;ee it in this country. With us it is militant; with you it is triumphant; and you know how it can act when its power is commen&s;urate to its will. I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to confine tho&s;e ob&s;ervations to any de&s;cription of men, or to com|prehend all men of any de&s;cription within them&mdash;No! far from it. I am as incapable of that inju&s;tice, as I am of keeping terms with tho&s;e who profe&s;s principles of extremes; and who under the name of religion teach little el&s;e than wild and dan|gerous politics. The wor&s;t of the&s;e politics of revolution is this; they temper and harden the brea&s;t, in order to prepare it for the de&s;perate &s;trokes which are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in ex|treme occa&s;ions. But as the&s;e occa&s;ions may never arrive, the mind receives a gratuitous taint; and the moral &s;entiments &s;uffer not a little, when no political purpo&s;e is &s;erved by the depravation. This &s;ort of people are &s;o taken up with their theories about the rights of man, that they have totally forgot his nature. Without opening one new avenue to the under|&s;tanding, they have &s;ucceeded in &s;topping up tho&s;e that lead to the heart. They have perverted in them&s;elves, and in tho&s;e that attend to them, all the well-placed &s;ympathies of the hu|man brea&s;t.</P>
<P>This famous &s;ermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but this &s;pirit through all the political part. Plots, ma&s;&s;acres, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, &s;eem to &s;ome people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution. A cheap, bloodle&s;s reformation, a guiltle&s;s li|berty, appear flat and vapid to their ta&s;te. There mu&s;t be a great change of &s;cene; there mu&s;t be a magnificent &s;tage effect; there mu&s;t be a grand &s;pectacle to rouze the imagination, grown torpid with the lazy enjoyment of &s;ixty years &s;ecurity, and the &s;till unanimating repo&s;e of public pro&s;perity. The Preacher found them all in the French revolution. This in|&s;pires a juvenile warmth through his whole frame. His enthu|&s;ia&s;m kindles as he advances; and when he arrives at his pero|ration, it is in a full blaze. Then viewing, from the Pi&s;gah of his pulpit, the free, moral, happy, flouri&s;hing, and glori|ous &s;tate of France, as in a bird-eye land&s;cape of a promi&s;ed land, he breaks out into the following rapture:</P>

<P>Before I proceed further, I have to remark, that Dr. Price &s;eems rather to over-value the great acqui&s;itions of light which he has obtained and diffu&s;ed in this age. The la&s;t century ap|pears to me to have been quite as much enlightened. It had, though in a different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr. Price; and &s;ome of the great preachers of that period partook of it as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of France. On the trial of the Rev. Hugh Peters for high trea&s;on, it was depo&s;ed, that when King Charles was brought to London for his trial, the Apo&s;tle of Liberty in that day conducted the <HI>triumph.</HI> "I &s;aw," &s;ays the witne&s;s, <Q>his maje&s;ty in the coach with &s;ix hor&s;es, and Peters riding before the king <HI>tri|umphing.</HI></Q> Dr. Price, when he talks as if he had made a di&s;covery, only follows a precedent; for, after the commence|ment of the king's trial, this precur&s;or, the &s;ame Dr. Peters, concluding a long prayer at the royal chapel at Whitehall, (he had very triumphantly cho&s;en his place) &s;aid, <Q>I have prayed and preached the&s;e twenty years; and now I may &s;ay with old Simeon, <HI>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. ii. p. 360, p. 363.</NOTE>.</Q> Peters had not the fruits of his prayer; for he neither departed &s;o &s;oon as he wi&s;h|ed, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily hope none of his followers may be in this country) him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to the triumph which he led as Pontiff. They dealt at the Re&s;tora|tion, perhaps, too hardly with this poor good man. But we owe it to his memory and his &s;ufferings, that he had as much illumination, and as much zeal, and had as effectually under|mined all <HI>the &s;uper&s;tition and error</HI> which might impede the great bu&s;ine&s;s he was engaged in, as any who follow and repeat after him, in this age, which would a&s;&s;ume to it&s;elf an exclu|&s;ive title to the knowledge of the rights of men, and all the glorious con&s;equences of that knowledge.</P>

<P>I find a preacher of the go&s;pel prophaning the beautiful and prophetic ejaculation, commonly called <HI>"nunc dimittis,"</HI> made on the fir&s;t pre&s;entation of our Saviour in the Temple, and applying it, with an inhuman and unnatural rapture, to the mo&s;t horrid, atrocious, and afflicting &s;pectacle, that perhaps ever was exhibited to the pity and indignation of mankind.

<P>This, my dear Sir, was not the triumph of France, I mu&s;t believe that, as a nation, it overwhelmed you with &s;hame and horror.

There they &s;it, after a gang of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had driven away all the men of moderate minds and moderating authority among&s;t them, and left them as a &s;ort of dregs and refu&s;e, under the apparent lead of tho&s;e in whom they do not &s;o much as pretend to have any confidence. There they &s;it, in mockery of legi&s;|lation, repeating in re&s;olutions the words of tho&s;e whom they dete&s;t and de&s;pi&s;e. Captives them&s;elves, they compel a cap|tive king to i&s;&s;ue as royal edicts, at third hand, the polluted non&s;en&s;e of their mo&s;t licentious and giddy coffee-hou&s;es. It is notorious, that all their mea&s;ures are decided before they are debated.

Among the&s;e are found per&s;ons, in compari&s;on of whom Cataline would be thought &s;crupulous, and Cethegus a man of &s;obriety and moderation.

Thus to admini&s;ter the opiate potion of amne&s;ty, powdered with all the ingredients of &s;corn and contempt, is to hold to his lips, in&s;tead of <Q>the balm of hurt minds,</Q> the cup of human mi&s;ery full to the brim, and to force him to drink it to the dregs.</P>
<P>Yielding to rea&s;ons, at lea&s;t as forcible as tho&s;e which were &s;o delicately urged in the compliment on the new year, the king of France will probably endeavour to forget the&s;e events, and that compliment. But hi&s;tory, who keeps a durable re|cord of all our acts, and exerci&s;es her awful cen&s;ure over the proceedings of all &s;orts of &s;overeigns, will not forget, either tho&s;e events, or the aera of this liberal refinement in the inter|cour&s;e of mankind. Hi&s;tory will record, that on the morning of the 6th of October 1789, the King and Queen of France, after a day of confu&s;ion, alarm, di&s;may, and &s;laughter, lay down, under the pledged &s;ecurity of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of re&s;pite, and troubled melancholy re|po&s;e. From this &s;leep the Queen was fir&s;t &s;tartled by the voice of the centinel at her door, who cried out to her, to &s;ave her|&s;elf by flight&mdash;that this was the la&s;t proof of fidelity he could give&mdash;that they were upon him, and he was dead. In&s;tantly

he was cut down. A band of cruel ru&s;&s;ians and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, reek|ing with his blood, ru&s;hed into the chamber of the Queen, and pierced with an hundred &s;trokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this per&s;ecuted woman had but ju&s;t time to fly almo&s;t naked, and through ways unknown to the murderers had e&s;caped to &s;eek refuge at the feet of a king and hu&s;band, not &s;ecure of his own life for a moment.</P>
<P>This king, to &s;ay no more of him, and this queen, and their infant children (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people) were then forced to abandon the &s;anctuary of the mo&s;t &s;plendid palace in the world, which they left &s;wimming in blood, polluted by ma&s;&s;acre, and &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed with &s;cattered limbs and mutilated carca&s;es. Thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom. Two had been &s;elected from the unprovoked, unre&s;i&s;ted, promi&s;cuous &s;laughter, which was made of the gentlemen of birth and fa|mily who compo&s;ed the king's body guard. The&s;e two gentle|men, with all the parade of an execution of ju&s;tice, were cruelly and publickly dragged to the block, and beheaded in the great court of the palace. Their heads were &s;tuck upon &s;pears, and led the proce&s;&s;ion; whil&s;t the royal captives who followed in the train were &s;lowly moved along, amid&s;t the hor|rid yells, and &s;hrilling &s;creams, and frantic dances, and infa|mous contumelies, and all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell, in the abu&s;ed &s;hape of the vile&s;t of women. After they had been made to ta&s;te, drop by drop, more than the bitterne&s;s of death, in the &s;low torture of a journey of twelve miles, protracted to &s;ix hours, they were, under a guard, com|po&s;ed of tho&s;e very &s;oldiers who had thus conducted them through this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old palaces of Paris, now converted into a Ba&s;tile for kings.</P>
<P>Is this a triumph to be con&s;ecrated at altars? to be comme|morated with grateful thank&s;giving? to be offered to the divine humanity with fervent prayer and enthu&s;ia&s;tick ejaculation?&mdash; The&s;e Theban and Thracian Orgies, acted in France, and applauded only in the Old Jewry, I a&s;&s;ure you, kindle prophe|tic enthu&s;ia&s;m in the minds but of very few people in this king|dom; although a &s;aint and apo&s;tle, who may have revelations of his own, and who has &s;o completely vanqui&s;hed all the mean &s;uper&s;titions of the heart, may incline to think it pious and de|corous to compare it with the entrance into the world of the Prince of Peace, proclaimed in an holy temple by a venerable &s;age, and not long before not wor&s;e announced by the voice of angels to the quiet innocence of &s;hepherds.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I was at a lo&s;s to account for this fit of unguarded tran&s;port. I knew, indeed, that the &s;ufferings of monarchs

make a delicious repa&s;t to &s;ome &s;ort of palates. There were reflections which might &s;erve to keep this appetite within &s;ome bounds of temperance. But when I took one circum&s;tance into my con&s;ideration, I was obliged to confe&s;s, that much allow|ance ought to be made for the Society, and that the tempta|tion was too &s;trong for common di&s;cretion; I mean, the cir|cum&s;tance of the &s;o Paean of the triumph, the animating cry which called <Q>for <HI>all</HI> the BISHOPS to be hanged on the lamp-po&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tous les Eveques &agrave; la lanterne.</NOTE>,</Q> might well have brought forth a bur&s;t of enthu&s;i|a&s;m on the fore&s;een con&s;equences of this happy day.

I allow this prophet to break forth into hymns of joy and thank&s;|giving on an event which appears like the precur&s;or of the Mil|lenium, and the projected fifth monarchy, in the de&s;truction of all church e&s;tabli&s;hments. There was, however (as in all hu|man affairs there is) in the mid&s;t of this joy &s;omething to exer|ci&s;e the patience of the&s;e worthy gentlemen, and to try the long-&s;uffering of their faith.

It unhap|pily was left unfini&s;hed, in this great hi&s;tory-piece of the ma&s;|&s;acre of innocents. What hardy pencil of a great ma&s;ter, from the &s;chool of the rights of men, will fini&s;h it, is to be &s;een here|after. The age has not yet the compleat benefit of that diffu&s;ion of knowledge that has undermined &s;uper&s;tition and error; and the king of France wants another object or two, to con&s;ign to oblivion, in con&s;ideration of all the good which is to ari&s;e from his own &s;ufferings, and the patriotic crimes of an inlightened age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is proper here to refer to a letter written upon this &s;ubject by an eye-witne&s;s.

much on that &s;hameful occa&s;ion.

I am very &s;orry to &s;ay it, very &s;orry indeed, that &s;uch per&s;onages are in a &s;ituation in which it is not unbecoming to prai&s;e the virtues of the great.</P>
<P>I hear, and I rejoice to hear, that the great lady, the other object of the triumph, has borne that day (one is intere&s;ted that beings made for &s;uffering &s;hould &s;uffer well) and that &s;he bears all the &s;ucceeding days, that &s;he bears the impri&s;onment of her hu&s;band, and her own captivity, and the exile of her friends, and the in&s;ulting adulation of addre&s;&s;es, and the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs, with a &s;erene patience, in a man|ner &s;uited to her rank and race, and becoming the offspring of a &s;overeign di&s;tingui&s;hed for her piety and her courage; that like her &s;he has lofty &s;entiments; that &s;he feels with the dignity of a Roman matron; that in the la&s;t extremity &s;he will &s;ave her&s;elf from the la&s;t di&s;grace, and that if &s;he mu&s;t fall, &s;he will fall by no ignoble hand.</P>
<P>It is now &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years &s;ince I &s;aw the queen of France, then the dauphine&s;s, at Ver&s;ailles; and &s;urely never lighted on this orb, which &s;he hardly &s;eemed to touch, a more delightful vi&s;ion. I &s;aw her ju&s;t above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated &s;phere &s;he ju&s;t began to move in, glittering like the morning-&s;tar, full of life, and &s;plendor, and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what an heart mu&s;t I have, to contemplate without immotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I dream that, when &s;he added titles of veneration to tho&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;tic, di&s;tant, re&s;pectful love, that &s;he &s;hould ever be obliged to carry the &s;harp antidote again&s;t di&s;grace concealed in that bo&s;om; little did I dream that I &s;hould have lived to &s;ee &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten thou&s;and &s;words mu&s;t have leaped from their &s;cabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with in&s;ult.&mdash;But the age of chivalry is gone &mdash;That of &s;ophi&s;ters, oeconomi&s;ts, and calculators, has &s;ucceeded; and the glory of Europe is extin|gui&s;hed for ever. Never, never more, &s;hall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and &s;ex, that proud &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that dignified obedience, that &s;ubordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in &s;ervitude it&s;elf, the &s;pirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of
<PB N="61" REF="023238_0063_0FBED4D421C850C0" MS="y">
nations, the nur&s;e of manly &s;entiment and heroic enterprize is gone! It is gone, that &s;en&s;ibility of principle, that cha&s;tity of honour, which felt a &s;tain like a wound, which in&s;pired courage whil&s;t it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice it&s;elf lo&s;t half its evil, by lo&s;ing all its gro&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This mixed &s;y&s;tem of opinion and &s;entiment had its origin in the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied in its ap|pearance by the varying &s;tate of human affairs, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and in|fluenced through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, even to the time we live in. If it &s;hould ever be totally extingui&s;hed, the lo&s;s I fear will be great. It is this which has given its character to mo|dern Europe. It is this which has di&s;tingui&s;hed it under all its forms of government, and di&s;tingui&s;hed it to its advantage, from the &s;tates of A&s;ia, and po&s;&s;ibly from tho&s;e &s;tates which flouri&s;hed in the mo&s;t brilliant periods of the antique world. It was this which, without confounding ranks, had produced a noble equa|lity, and handed it down through all the gradations of &s;ocial life. It was this opinion which mitigated kings into companions, and rai&s;ed private men to be fellows with kings. Without force, or oppo&s;ition, it &s;ubdued the fiercene&s;s of pride and power; it obliged &s;overeigns to &s;ubmit to the &s;ofter collar of &s;ocial e&s;teem, compelled &s;tern authority to &s;ubmit to elegance, and gave a domination van|qui&s;her of laws to be &s;ubdued by manners.</P>
<P>But now all is to be changed. All the plea&s;ing illu&s;ions, which made power gentle, and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different &s;hades of life, and which, by a bland a&s;&s;imilation, incor|porated into politics the &s;entiments which beautify and &s;often pri|vate &s;ociety, are to be di&s;&s;olved by this new conquering empire of light and rea&s;on. All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the &s;uperadded ideas, furni&s;hed from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns, and the under&s;tand|ing ratifies, as nece&s;&s;ary to cover the defects of our naked &s;hivering nature, and to rai&s;e it to dignity in our own e&s;timation, are to be exploded as a ridiculous, ab&s;urd, and antiquated fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>On this &s;cheme of things, a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal, and an animal not of the highe&s;t order. All homage paid to the &s;ex in general as &s;uch, and without di&s;tinct views, is to be regarded as romance and folly. Regicide, and parricide, and &s;acrilege, are but fictions of &s;uper&s;ti|tion, corrupting juri&s;prudence by de&s;troying its &s;implicity. The murder of a king, or a queen, or a bi&s;hop, or a father, are only common homicide; and if the people are by any chance, or in any way gainers by it, a &s;ort of homicide much the mo&s;t pardon|able, and into which we ought not to make too &s;evere a &s;crutiny.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="023238_0064_0FBED4D5A71BA090">On the &s;cheme of this barbarous philo&s;ophy, which is the off|&s;pring of cold hearts and muddy under&s;tandings, and which is as void of &s;olid wi&s;dom, as it is de&s;titute of all ta&s;te and elegance, laws are to be &s;upported only by their own terrors, and by the concern which each individual may find in them, from his own private &s;peculations, or can &s;pare to them from his own private in|tere&s;ts. In the groves of <HI>their</HI> academy, at the end of every vi&s;to, you &s;ee nothing but the gallows. Nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the commonwealth. On the princi|ples of this mechanic philo&s;ophy, our in&s;titutions can never be embodied, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, in per&s;ons; &s;o as to create in us love, veneration, admiration, or attachment. But that &s;ort of rea&s;on which bani&s;hes the affections is incapable of filling their place. The&s;e public affections, combined with manners, are re|quired &s;ometimes as &s;upplements, &s;ometimes as correctives, always as aids to law. The precept given by a wi&s;e man, as well as a great critic, for the con&s;truction of poems, is equally true as to &s;tates. <HI>Non &s;atis e&s;t pulchra e&s;&s;e poemata, dulcia &s;unto.</HI> There ought to be a &s;y&s;tem of manners in every nation which a well-formed mind would be di&s;po&s;ed to reli&s;h. To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely.</P>
<P>But power, of &s;ome kind or other, will &s;urvive the &s;hock in which manners and opinions peri&s;h; and it will find other and wor&s;e means for its &s;upport. The u&s;urpation which, in order to &s;ubvert antient in&s;titutions, has de&s;troyed antient principles, will hold power by arts &s;imilar to tho&s;e by which it has acquired it.&mdash; When the old feudal and chivalrous &s;pirit of <HI>Fealty,</HI> which, by freeing kings from fear, freed both kings and &s;ubjects from the precautions of tyranny, &s;hall be extinct in the minds of men, plots and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations will be anticipated by preventive murder and pre|ventive confi&s;cation, and that long roll of grim and bloody max|ims, which form the political code of all power, not &s;tanding on its own honour, and the honour of tho&s;e who are to obey it. Kings will be tyrants from policy when &s;ubjects are rebels from principle.</P>
<P>When antient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the lo&s;s cannot po&s;&s;ibly be e&s;timated. From that moment we have no compa&s;s to govern us; nor can we know di&s;tinctly to what port we &s;teer. Europe undoubtedly, taken in a ma&s;s, was in a flouri&s;hing condition the day on which your Revolution was completed. How much of that pro&s;perous &s;tate was owing to the &s;pirit of our old manners and opinions, is not ea&s;y to &s;ay; but as &s;uch cau&s;es cannot be indifferent in their operation, we mu&s;t pre&s;ume, that, on the whole, their operation was beneficial.</P>
<P>We are but too apt to con&s;ider things in the &s;tate in which we find them, without &s;ufficiently adverting to the cau&s;es by which
<PB N="63" REF="023238_0065_0FBED4D72162B508">
they have been produced, and po&s;&s;ibly may be upheld. Nothing is more certain, than that our manners, our civilization, and all the good things which are connected with manners, and with civilization, have, in this European world of ours, depended for ages upon two principles, and were indeed the re&s;ult of both com|bined; I mean the &s;pirit of a gentleman, and the &s;pirit of religion. The nobility and the clergy, the one by profe&s;&s;ion, the other by patronage, kept learning in exi&s;tence, even in the mid&s;t of arms and confu&s;ions, and whil&s;t governments were rather in their cau&s;es than formed. Learning paid back what it received to nobility and to prie&s;thood, and paid it with u&s;ury, by enlarging their ideas, and by furni&s;hing their minds. Happy if they had all continued to know their indi&s;&s;oluble union, and their proper place! Happy if learning, not debauched by ambition, had been &s;atisfied to con|tinue the in&s;tructor, and not a&s;pired to be the ma&s;ter! Along with its natural protectors and guardians, learning will be ca&s;t into the mire, and trodden down under the hoofs of a &s;wini&s;h multitude.</P>
<P>If, as I &s;u&s;pect, modern letters owe more than they are al|ways willing to own to antient manners, &s;o do other intere&s;ts which we value full as much as they are worth. Even com|merce, and trade, and manufacture, the gods of our oecono|mical politicians, are them&s;elves perhaps but creatures; are them&s;elves but effects, which, as fir&s;t cau&s;es, we choo&s;e to wor|&s;hip. They certainly grew under the &s;ame &s;hade in which learning flouri&s;hed. They too may decay with their natural protecting principles. With you, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, they all threaten to di&s;appear together. Where trade and manu|factures are wanting to a people, and the &s;pirit of nobility and religion remains, &s;entiment &s;upplies, and not always ill &s;up|plies their place; but if commerce and the arts &s;hould be lo&s;t in an experiment to try how well a &s;tate may &s;tand without the&s;e old fundamental principles, what &s;ort of a thing mu&s;t be a na|tion of gro&s;s, &s;tupid, ferocious, and at the &s;ame time, poor and &s;ordid barbarians, de&s;titute of religion, honour, or manly pride, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing nothing at pre&s;ent, and hoping for nothing hereafter?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you may not be going fa&s;t, and by the &s;horte&s;t cut, to that horrible and di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ituation. Already there appears a poverty of conception, a coar&s;ene&s;s and vulgarity in all the proceedings of the a&s;&s;embly and of all their in&s;tructors. Their liberty is not liberal. Their &s;cience is pre&s;umptuous igno|rance. Their humanity is &s;avage and brutal.</P>
<P>It is not clear, whether in England we learned tho&s;e grand and decorous principles, and manners, of which con&s;iderable traces yet remain, from you, or whether you took them from
<PB N="64" REF="023238_0066_0FBED4D8EA9AD858">
us. But to you, I think, we trace them be&s;t. You &s;eem to me to be&mdash;<HI>gentis incunabula no&s;trae.</HI> France has always more or le&s;s influenced manners in England; and when your fountain is choaked up and polluted, the &s;tream will not run long, or not run clear with us, or perhaps with any nation. This gives all Europe, in my opinion, but too clo&s;e and connected a con|cern in what is done in France. Excu&s;e me, therefore, If I have dwelt too long on the atrocious &s;pectacle of the &s;ixth of October 1789, or have given too much &s;cope to the reflexions which have ari&s;en in my mind on occa&s;ion of the mo&s;t import|ant of all revolutions, which may be dated from that day, I mean a revolution in &s;entiments, manners, and moral opinions. As things now &s;tand, with every thing re&s;pectable de&s;troyed without us, and an attempt to de&s;troy within us every princi|ple of re&s;pect, one is almo&s;t forced to apologize for harbouring the common feelings of men.</P>
<P>Why do I feel &s;o differently from the Reverend Dr. Price, and tho&s;e of his lay flock, who will choo&s;e to adopt the &s;enti|ments of his di&s;cour&s;e?&mdash;For this plain rea&s;on&mdash;becau&s;e it is <HI>natural</HI> I &s;hould; becau&s;e we are &s;o made as to be affected at &s;uch &s;pectacles with melancholy &s;entiments upon the un&s;table condition of mortal pro&s;perity, and the tremendous uncertainty of human greatne&s;s; becau&s;e in tho&s;e natural feelings we learn great le&s;&s;ons; becau&s;e in events like the&s;e our pa&s;&s;ions in&s;truct our rea&s;on; becau&s;e when kings are hurl'd from their thrones by the Supreme Director of this great drama, and become the objects of in&s;ult to the ba&s;e, and of pity to the good, we behold &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters in the moral, as we &s;hould behold a miracle in the phy&s;ical order of things. We are alarmed into reflexion; our minds (as it has long &s;ince been ob&s;erved) are purified by terror and pity; our weak unthinking pride is humbled, under the di&s;pen&s;ations of a my&s;terious wi&s;dom.&mdash;Some tears might be drawn from me, if &s;uch a &s;pectacle were exhibited on the &s;tage. I &s;hould be truly a&s;hamed of finding in my&s;elf that &s;u|perficial, theatric &s;en&s;e of painted di&s;tre&s;s, whil&s;t I could exult over it in real life. With &s;uch a perverted mind, I could ne|ver venture to &s;hew my face at a tragedy. People would think the tears that Garrick formerly, or that Siddons not long &s;ince, have extorted from me, were the tears of hypocri&s;y; I &s;hould know them to be the tears of folly.</P>
<P>Indeed the theatre is a better &s;chool of moral &s;entiments than churches, where the feelings of humanity are thus outraged. Poets, who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated in the &s;chool of the rights of men, and who mu&s;t apply them&s;elves to the moral con&s;titution of the heart, would not dare to pro|duce &s;uch a triumph as a matter of exultation. There, where
<PB N="65" REF="023238_0067_0FBED4DF1EB8BF00" MS="y">
men follow their natural impul&s;es, they would not bear the odious maxims of a Machiavelian policy, whether applied to the attainment of monarchical or democratic tyranny. They would reject them on the modern, as they once did on the anti|ent &s;tage, where they could not bear even the hopothetical propo&s;ition of &s;uch wickedne&s;s in the mouth of a per&s;onated ty|rant, though &s;uitable to the character he &s;u&s;tained. No thea|tric audience in Athens would bear what has been borne, in the mid&s;t of the real tragedy of this triumphal day; a principal actor weighing, as it were in &s;cales hung in a &s;hop of horrors,&mdash; &s;o much actual crime again&s;t &s;o much contingent advantage,&mdash; and after putting in and out weights, declaring that the ba|lance was on the &s;ide of the advantages. They would not bear to &s;ee the crimes of new democracy po&s;ted as in a ledger again&s;t the crimes of old de&s;poti&s;m, and the book-keepers of politics finding democracy &s;till in debt, but by no means unable or un|willing to pay the balance. In the theatre, the fir&s;t intuitive glance, without any elaborate proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, would &s;hew, that this method of political computation, would ju&s;tify every extent of crime. They would &s;ee, that on the&s;e principles, even where the very wor&s;t acts were not perpetrated, it was owing rather to the fortune of the con&s;pirators than to their par&s;imony in the expenditure of treachery and blood. They would &s;oon &s;ee, that criminal means once tolerated are &s;oon preferred. They pre&s;ent a &s;horter cut to the object than through the high-way of the moral virtues. Ju&s;tifying perfidy and murder for public benefit, public benefit would &s;oon be|come the pretext, and perfidy and murder the end; until rapa|city, malice, revenge, and fear more dreadful than revenge, could &s;atiate their in&s;atiable appetites. Such mu&s;t be con&s;e|quences of lo&s;ing in the &s;plendour of the&s;e triumphs of the rights of men, all natural &s;en&s;e of wrong and right.</P>
<P>But the Reverend Pa&s;tor exults in this "leading in triumph," becau&s;e truly Louis XVIth was "an arbitrary monarch;" that is, in other words, neither more nor le&s;s, than becau&s;e he was Louis the XVIth, and becau&s;e he had the misfortune to be born king of France, with the prerogatives of which, a long line of ance&s;tors, and a long acquie&s;cence of the people, without any act of his, had put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A misfortune it has indeed turned out to him, that he was born king of France. But misfortune is not crime, nor is indi&s;cretion al|ways the greate&s;t guilt. I &s;hall never think that a prince, the acts of who&s;e whole reign were a &s;eries of conce&s;&s;ions to his &s;ubjects, who was willing to relax his authority, to remit his prerogatives, to call his people to a &s;hare of freedom, not known, perhaps not de&s;ired by their ance&s;tors; &s;uch a prince,
<PB N="66" REF="023238_0068_0FBED4E15BC9F7C8" MS="y">
though he &s;hould be &s;ubject to the common frailties attached to men and to princes, though he &s;hould have once thought it nece&s;&s;ary to provide force again&s;t the de&s;perate de&s;igns mani|fe&s;tly carrying on again&s;t his per&s;on, and the remnants of his authority; though all this &s;hould be taken into con&s;ideration, I &s;hall be led with great difficulty to think he de&s;erves the cruel and in&s;ulting triumph of Paris, and of Dr. Price. I tremble for the cau&s;e of liberty, from &s;uch an example to kings. I tremble for the cau&s;e of humanity, in the unpuni&s;hed outrages of the mo&s;t wicked of mankind. But there are &s;ome people of that low and degenerate fa&s;hion of mind, that they look up with a &s;ort of complacent awe and admiration to kings, who know to keep firm in their &s;eat, to hold a &s;trict hand over their &s;ubjects, to a&s;&s;ert their prerogative, and by the awakened vigi|lance of a &s;evere de&s;poti&s;m, to guard again&s;t the very fir&s;t ap|proaches of freedom. Again&s;t &s;uch as the&s;e they never elevate their voice. De&s;orters from principle, li&s;ted with fortune, they never &s;ee any good in &s;uffering virtue, nor any crime in pro&s;perous u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>If it could have been made clear to me, that the king and queen of France (tho&s;e I mean who were &s;uch before the tri|umph) were inexorable and cruel tyrants, that they had formed a deliberate &s;cheme for ma&s;&s;acring the National A&s;&s;embly (I think I have &s;een &s;omething like the latter in&s;inuated in certain publications) I &s;hould think their captivity ju&s;t. If this be true, much more ought to have been done, but done, in my opinion, in another manner. The puni&s;hment of real tyrants is a noble and awful act of ju&s;tice; and it has with truth been &s;aid to be con&s;olatory to the human mind. But if I were to puni&s;h a wicked king, I &s;hould regard the dignity in avenging the crime. Ju&s;tice is grave and decorous, and in its puni&s;h|ments rather &s;eems to &s;ubmit to a nece&s;&s;ity, than to make a choice. Had Nero, or Agrippina, or Louis the eleventh, or Charles the ninth, been the &s;ubject; if Charles the twelfth of Sweeden, after the murder of Patkul, or his predece&s;&s;or Chri&s;tina, after the murder of Monalde&s;chi, had fallen into your hands, Sir, or into mine, I am &s;ure our conduct would have been different.</P>
<P>If the French King, or King of the French, (or by what|ever name he is known in the new vocabulary of your con&s;titution) has in his own per&s;on, and that of his queen, really de&s;erved the&s;e unavowed but unavenged murderous at|tempts, and tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent indignities more cruel than mur|der, &s;uch a per&s;on would ill de&s;erve even that &s;ubordinate executory tru&s;t, which I under&s;tand is to be placed in him; nor is he fit to be called chief in a nation which he has outraged
<PB N="67" REF="023238_0069_0FBED4E3E961F6B0">
and oppre&s;&s;ed. A wor&s;e choice for &s;uch an office in a new commonwealth, than that of a depo&s;ed tyrant, could not po&s;|&s;ibly be made. But to degrade and in&s;ult a man as the wor&s;t of criminals, and afterwards to tru&s;t him in your highe&s;t con|cerns, as a faithful, hone&s;t, and zealous &s;ervant, is not con&s;i&s;tent in rea&s;oning, nor prudent in policy, nor &s;afe in practice Tho&s;e who could make &s;uch an appointment mu&s;t be guilty of a more flagrant breach of tru&s;t than any they have yet committed again&s;t the people. As this is the only crime in which your leading politicians could have acted incon&s;i&s;tently, I conlcude that there is no &s;ort of ground for the&s;e horrid in&s;inuations. I think no better of all the other calumnies.</P>
<P>In England, we give no credit to them. We are generous enemies: We are faithful allies. We &s;purn from us with di&s;|gu&s;t and indignation the &s;landers of tho&s;e who bring us their anecdotes with the atte&s;tation of the flower-de-luce on their &s;houlder. We have Lord George Gordon fa&s;t in Newgate; and neither his being a public pro&s;elyte to Judai&s;m, nor his having in his zeal again&s;t Catholick prie&s;ts and all &s;ort of eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, rai&s;ed a mob (excu&s;e the term, it is &s;till in u&s;e here) which pulled down all our pri&s;ons, have pre&s;erved to him a liberty, of which he did not render him&s;elf worthy by a virtuous u&s;e of it. We have rebuilt Newgate, and tenanted the man&s;ion. We have pri&s;ons almo&s;t as &s;trong as the Ba&s;tile, for tho&s;e who dare to libel the queens of France. In this &s;piritual retreat, let the noble libeller remain. Let him there meditate on his Thalmud, until he learns a conduct more becoming his birth and parts, and not &s;o di&s;graceful to the antient religion to which he has become a pro&s;elyte; or until &s;ome per&s;ons from your &s;ide of the water, to plea&s;e your new Hebrew brethren, &s;hall ran|&s;om him. He may then be enabled to purcha&s;e, with the old hoards of the &s;ynagogue, and a very &s;mall poundage, on the long compounded intere&s;t of the thirty pieces of &s;ilver (Dr. Price has &s;hewn us what miracles compound intere&s;t will perform in 1790 years) the lands which are lately di&s;covered to have been u&s;urped by the Gallican church. Send us your popi&s;h Arch|bi&s;hop of Paris, and we will &s;end you our prote&s;tant Rabbin. We &s;hall treat the per&s;on you &s;end us in exchange like a gen|tleman and an hone&s;t man, as he is; but pray let him bring with him the fund of his ho&s;pitality, bounty, and charity; and, depend upon it, we &s;hall never confi&s;cate a &s;hilling of that ho|nourable and pious fund, nor think of enriching the trea&s;ury with the &s;poils of the poor-box.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth, my dear Sir, I think the honour of our nation to be &s;omewhat concerned in the di&s;claimer of the proceedings of this &s;ociety of the Old Jewry and the London
<PB N="68" REF="023238_0070_0FBED4E78C571690">
Tavern. I have no man's proxy. I &s;peak only from my&s;elf; when I di&s;claim, as I do with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, all com|munion with the actors in that triumph, or with admirers of it. When I a&s;&s;ert any thing el&s;e, as concerning the people of England, I &s;peak from ob&s;ervation not from authority; but I &s;peak from the experience I have had in a pretty exten&s;ive and mixed communication with the inhabitants of this kingdom, of all de&s;criptions and ranks, and after a cour&s;e of attentive ob|&s;ervation, began early in life, and continued for near forty years. I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed, con&s;idering that we are divided from you but by a &s;lender dyke of about twenty-four miles, and that the mutual intercour&s;e between the two coun|tries has lately been very great, to find how little you &s;eem to know of us. I &s;u&s;pect that this is owing to your forming a judg|ment of this nation from certain publications, which do, very erroneou&s;ly, if they do at all, repre&s;ent the opinions and di&s;po|&s;itions generally prevalent in England. The vanity, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, petulence, and &s;pirit of intrigue of &s;everal petty caba's, who attempt to hide their total want of con&s;equence in bu&s;tle and noi&s;e, and puffing, and mutual quotation of each other, makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect of their abilities is a mark of general acquie&s;cence in their opinions. No &s;uch thing, I a&s;&s;ure you. Becau&s;e half a dozen gra&s;hoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whil&s;t thou&s;ands of great cattle, repo&s;ed beneath the &s;hadow of the Briti&s;h oak, chew the cud and are &s;ilent, pray do not imagine, that tho&s;e who make the noi&s;e are the only inhabitants of the field; that, of cour&s;e, they are many in number; or that, after all, they are other than the little &s;hrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and trouble&s;ome in&s;ects of the hour.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t venture to affirm, that not one in a hundred among&s;t us participates in the "triumph" of the Revolution Society. If the king and queen of France, and their children, were to fall into our hands by the chance of war, in the mo&s;t acrimo|nious of all ho&s;tilities (I deprecate &s;uch an event, I deprecate &s;uch ho&s;tility) they would be treated with another &s;ort of trium|phal entry into London. We formerly have had a king of France in that &s;ituation; you have read how he was treated by the victor in the field; and in what manner he was afterwards received in England. Four hundred years have gone over us; but I believe we are not materially changed &s;ince that period. Thanks to our &s;ullen re&s;i&s;tance to innovation, thanks to the cold &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of our national character, we &s;till bear the &s;tamp of our forefathers. We have not (as I conceive) lo&s;t the ge|nero&s;ity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century; nor as yet have we &s;ubtilized our&s;elves into &s;avages. We are
<PB N="69" REF="023238_0071_0FBED4E862529B18">
not the converts of Rou&s;&s;eau; we are not the di&s;ciples of Vol|taire; Helvetius has made no progre&s;s among&s;t us. Athei&s;ts are not our preachers; madmen are not our lawgivers. We know that <HI>we</HI> have made no di&s;coveries; and we think that no di&s;coveries are to be made, in morality; nor many in the great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which were under&s;tood long before we were born altogether as well as they will be after the grave has heaped its mould upon our pre&s;umption, and the &s;ilent tomb &s;hall have impo&s;ed its law on our pert loquacity. In England we have not yet been com|pleatly embowelled of our natural entrails; we &s;till feel within us, and we cheri&s;h and cultivate, tho&s;e inbred &s;entiments which are the faithful guardians, the active monitors of our duty, the true &s;upporters of all liberal and manly morals. We have not been drawn and tru&s;&s;ed, in order that we may be filled, like &s;tuffed birds in a mu&s;eum, with chaff and rags, and pal|try, blurred &s;hreds of paper about the rights of man. We pre&s;erve the whole of our feelings &s;till native and entire, un&s;o|phi&s;ticated by pedantry and infidelity. We have real hearts of fle&s;h and blood beating in our bo&s;oms. We fear God; we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magi&s;trates; with reverence to prie&s;ts; and with re&s;pect to nobility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h are I conceive, mi&s;repre&s;ented in a Letter publi&s;hed in one of the papers, by a gentleman thought to be a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter.&mdash;When wri|ting to Dr. Price, of the &s;pirit which prevails at Paris, he &s;ays, <Q>The &s;pirit of the people in this place has aboli&s;hed all the proud <HI>di&s;tinctions</HI> which the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>nobles</HI> had u&s;urped in their minds; whether they talk of <HI>the king, the noble, or the prie&s;t,</HI> their whole language is that of the mo&s;t <HI>enlightened and liberal among&s;t the Engli&s;h.</HI></Q> If this gentleman means to confine the terms <HI>enlightened and liberal</HI> to one &s;et of men in England, it may be true.

<P>You &s;ee, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confe&s;s, that we are generally men of untaught feelings; that in&s;tead of ca&s;ting away all our old prejudices, we cheri&s;h them to a very con&s;iderable degree, and to take more &s;hame to our&s;elves, we cheri&s;h them becau&s;e they are prejudices; and the longer they have la&s;ted, and the more generally they have prevailed, the more we cheri&s;h them. We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private &s;tock of rea&s;on;
<PB N="70" REF="023238_0072_0FBED4EACF61FD00">
becau&s;e we &s;u&s;pect that this &s;tock in each man is &s;mall, and that the individuals would do better to avail them&s;elves of the ge|neral bank and capital of nations, and of ages. Many of our men of &s;peculation, in&s;tead of exploding general prejudices, employ their &s;agacity to di&s;cover the latent wi&s;dom which pre|vails in them. If they find what they &s;eek, and they &s;eldom fail, they think it more wi&s;e to continue the prejudice, with the rea&s;on involved, than to ca&s;t away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but the naked rea&s;on; becau&s;e prejudice, with its rea&s;on, has a motive to give action to that rea&s;on, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previou&s;ly engages the mind in a &s;teady cour&s;e of wi&s;dom and virtue, and does not leave the man he&s;itating in the moment of deci&s;ion, &s;ceptical, puzzled, and unre&s;olved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit; and not a &s;eries of unconnected acts. Through ju&s;t prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.</P>
<P>Your literary men, and your politicians, and &s;o do the whole clan of the enlightened among us, e&s;&s;entially differ in the&s;e points. They have no re&s;pect for the wi&s;dom of others; but they pay it off by a very full mea&s;ure of confidence in their own. With them it is a &s;ufficient motive to de&s;troy an old &s;cheme of things, becau&s;e it is an old one. As to the new, they are in no &s;ort of fear with the regard to the duration of a building run up in ha&s;te; becau&s;e duration is no object to tho&s;e who think little or nothing has been done before their time, and who place all their hopes in di&s;covery. They conceive, very &s;y&s;tematically, that all things which give perpetuity are mi&s;chievous, and therefore they are at inexpiable war with all e&s;tabli&s;hments. They think that government may vary like modes of dre&s;s, and with as little ill effect. That there needs no principle of attachment, except a &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent conve|niency, to any con&s;titution of the &s;tate. They always &s;peak as if they were of opinion that there is a &s;ingular &s;pecies of compact between them and their magi&s;trates, which binds the magi&s;trate, but which has nothing reciprocal in it, but that the maje&s;ty of the people has a right to di&s;&s;olve it without any rea&s;on but its will. Their attachment to their country it&s;elf, is only &s;o far as it agrees with &s;ome of their fleeting projects; it begins and ends with that &s;cheme of polity which falls in with their momentary opinion.</P>
<P>The&s;e doctrines, or rather &s;entiments, &s;eem prevalent with your new &s;tate&s;men. But they are wholly different from tho&s;e on which we have always acted in this country.</P>
<P>I hear it is &s;ometimes given out in France, that what is doing among you is after the example of England. I beg
<PB N="71" REF="023238_0073_0FBED4ECAD40D2D8">
leave to affirm, that &s;carcely any thing done with you has originated from the practice or the prevalent opinions of this people, either in the act or in the &s;pirit of the proceeding. Let me add, that we are as unwilling to learn the&s;e le&s;&s;ons from France, as we are &s;ure that we never taught them to that nation. The cabals here who take a &s;ort of &s;hare in your tran&s;actions as yet con&s;i&s;t but of an handful of people. If unfortunately by their intrigues, their &s;ermons, their publica|tions, and by a confidence derived from an expected union with the coun&s;els and forces of the French nation, they &s;hould draw con&s;iderable numbers into their faction, and in con&s;equence &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly attempt any thing here in imitation of what has been done with you, the event, I dare venture to prophe&s;y, will be, that, with &s;ome trouble to their country, they will &s;oon accompli&s;h their own de&s;truction. This people refu&s;ed to change their law in remote ages, from re&s;pect to the infallibi|lity of popes; and they will not now alter it from a pious implicit faith in the dogmati&s;m of philo&s;ophers; though the former was armed with the anathema and cru&s;ade, and though the latter &s;hould act with the libel and the lamp-iron.</P>
<P>Formerly your affairs were your own concern only. We felt for them as men; but we kept aloof from them, becau&s;e we were not citizens of France. But when we &s;ee the model held up to our&s;elves, we mu&s;t feel as Engli&s;hmen, and feeling, we mu&s;t provide as Engli&s;hmen. Your affairs, in &s;pite of us, are made a part of our intere&s;t; &s;o far at lea&s;t as to keep at a di&s;tance your panacea, or your plague. If it be a panacea, we do not want it. We know the con&s;equences of unnece&s;&s;ary phy&s;ic. If it be a plague; it is &s;uch a plague, that the precautions of the mo&s;t &s;evere quarantine ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I hear on all hands that a cabal, calling it&s;elf philo&s;ophie, receives the glory of many of the late proceedings; and that their opinions and &s;y&s;tems are the true actuating &s;pirit of the whole of them. I have heard of no party in England, literary or political, at any time, known by &s;uch a de&s;cription. It is not with you compo&s;ed of tho&s;e men, is it? whom the vulgar, in their blunt homely &s;tyle, commonly call Athei&s;ts and Infidels? If it be, I admit that we too have had writers of that de&s;crip|tion, who made &s;ome noi&s;e in their day. At pre&s;ent they repo&s;e in la&s;ting oblivion. Who, born within the la&s;t forty years, has read one word of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that whole race who called them&s;elves freethinkers? Who now reads Bolingbroke? Who ever read him through? a&s;k the book&s;ellers of London what is become of all the&s;e lights of the world. In as few years their few &s;ucce&s;&s;ors will go to the family vault of "all the Capulets."

But whatever they were, or are, with us, they were and are wholly unconnected individuals. With us they kept the com|mon nature of their kind, and were not gregarious. They never acted in corps, nor were known as a faction in the &s;tate, nor pre&s;umed to influence, in that name or character, or for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch a faction, on any of our public concerns. Whether they ought &s;o to exi&s;t, and &s;o be permitted to act, is another que&s;tion. As &s;uch cabals have not exi&s;ted in England, &s;o neither has the &s;pirit of them had any influence in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the original frame of our con&s;titution, or in any one of the &s;everal reparations and improvements it has undergone. The whole has been done under the au&s;pices, and is confirmed by the &s;anctions of religion and piety. The whole has emanated from the &s;implicity of our national character, and from a &s;ort of na|tive plainne&s;s and directne&s;s of under&s;tanding, which for a long time characterized tho&s;e men who have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively obtained authority among&s;t us.

In England we are &s;o convinced of this, that there is no ru&s;t of &s;uper&s;tition, with which the accumulated ab&s;urdity of the human mind might have cru&s;ted it over in the cour&s;e of ages, that ninety-nine in an hundred of the people of England would not prefer to impiety. We &s;hall never be &s;uch fools as to call in an enemy to the &s;ub&s;tance of any &s;y&s;tem to remove its corruptions, to &s;upply its defects, or to perfect its con&s;truction. If our religious tenets &s;hould ever want a further elucidation, we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> call on athei&s;m to explain them. We &s;hall not light up our temple from that unhallowed fire. It will be illuminated with other lights.

If our eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould want a revi&s;ion, it is not avarice or rapacity, public or private, that we &s;hall employ for the audit, or receipt, or application of its con&s;ecrated revenue.&mdash;Violently condemning neither the Greek nor the Armenian, nor, &s;ince heats are &s;ub&s;ided, the Ro|man &s;y&s;tem of religion, we prefer the Prote&s;tant; not becau&s;e we think it has le&s;s of the Chri&s;tian religion it it, but becau&s;e, in our judgment, it has more. We are Prote&s;tants, not from indifference but from zeal.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="023238_0075_0FBED4F249E660C8">We know, and it is our pride to know, that man is by his con&s;titution a religious animal; that athei&s;m is again&s;t, not only our rea&s;on but our in&s;tincts; and that it cannot prevail long. But if, in the moment of riot, and in a drunken delirium from the hot &s;pirit drawn out of the alembick of hell, which in France is now &s;o furiou&s;ly boiling, we &s;hould uncover our na|kedne&s;s by throwing off that Chri&s;tian religion which has hitherto been our boa&s;t and comfort, and one great &s;ource of civilization among&s;t us, and among many other nations; we are apprehen&s;ive (being well aware that the mind will not endure a void) that &s;ome uncouth, pernicious, and degrading &s;uper&s;tition, might take place of it.</P>
<P>For that rea&s;on, before we take from our e&s;tabli&s;hment the natural human means of e&s;timation, and give it up to contempt, as you have done, and in doing it have incurred the penalties you well de&s;erve to &s;uffer, we de&s;ire that &s;ome other may be pre&s;ented to us in the place of it. We &s;hall then form our judgment.</P>
<P>On the&s;e ideas, in&s;tead of quarrelling with e&s;tabli&s;hments, as &s;ome do, who have made a philo&s;ophy and a religion of their ho&s;tility to &s;uch in&s;titutions, we clave clo&s;ely to them. We are re&s;olved to keep an e&s;tabli&s;hed church, an e&s;tabli&s;hed monarchy, an e&s;tabli&s;hed ari&s;tocracy, and an e&s;tabli&s;hed demo|cracy, each in the degree it exi&s;ts, and in no greater. I &s;hall &s;hew you pre&s;ently how much of each of the&s;e we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been the misfortune (not as the&s;e gentlemen think it, the glory) of this age, that every thing is to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, as if the con&s;titution of our country were to be always a &s;ubject rather of altercation than enjoyment. For this rea&s;on, as well as for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e among you (if any &s;uch you have among you) who may wi&s;h to profit of examples, I venture to trouble you with a few thoughts upon each of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. I do not think they were unwi&s;e in antient Rome, who, when they wi&s;hed to new-model their laws, &s;ent commi&s;|&s;ioners to examine the be&s;t con&s;tituted republics within their reach.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I beg leave to &s;peak of our church e&s;tabli&s;hment, which is the fir&s;t of our prejudices, not a prejudice de&s;titute of rea&s;on, but involving in it profound and exten&s;ive wi&s;dom. I &s;peak of it fir&s;t. It is fir&s;t, and la&s;t, and mid&s;t in our minds. For, taking ground on that religious &s;y&s;tem, of which we are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we continue to act on the early received, and uniformly continued &s;en&s;e of mankind. That &s;en&s;e not only, like a wi&s;e architect, hath built up the augu&s;t fabric of &s;tates, but like a provident proprietor, to pre&s;erve the &s;tructure from prophanation and ruin, as a &s;acred temple, purged from all

the impurities of fraud, and violence, and inju&s;tice, and tyranny, hath &s;olemnly and for ever con&s;ecrated the common wealth, and all that officiate in it. This con&s;ecration is made, that all who admini&s;ter in the government of men, in which they &s;tand in the per&s;on of God him&s;elf, &s;hould have high and worthy notions of their function and de&s;tination; that their hope &s;hould be full of immortality; that they &s;hould not look to the paltry pelf of the moment, nor to the temporary and tran&s;ient prai&s;e of the vul|gar, but to a &s;olid, permanent exi&s;tence, in the permanent part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory, in the ex|ample they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.</P>
<P>Such &s;ublime principles ought to be infu&s;ed into per&s;ons of exalted &s;ituations: and religious e&s;tabli&s;hments provided, that may continually revive and enforce them. Every &s;ort of moral, every &s;ort of civil, every &s;ort of public in&s;titution, aiding the the rational and natural ties that connect the human under|&s;tanding and affections to the divine, are not more than nece&s;|&s;ary, in order to build up that wonderful &s;tructure, Man; who&s;e prerogative it is, to be in a great degree a creature of his own making; and who when made as he ought to be made, is de&s;tined to hold no trivial place in the creation. But whenever man is put over men, as the better nature ought ever to pre|&s;ide, in that ca&s;e more particularly, he &s;hould as nearly as po&s;&s;ible be approximated to his perfection.</P>
<P>The con&s;ecration of the &s;tate, by a &s;tate religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to operate with an whole&s;ome awe upon free citizens; becau&s;e, in order to &s;ecure their freedom, they mu&s;t enjoy &s;ome determinate portion of power. To them there|fore a religion connected with the &s;tate, and with their duty towards it, becomes even more nece&s;&s;ary than in &s;uch &s;ocieties, where the people by the terms of their &s;ubjection are confined to private &s;entiments, and the management of their own family concerns. All per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any portion of power ought to be &s;trongly and awefully impre&s;&s;ed with an idea that they act in tru&s;t; and that they are to account for their conduct in that tru&s;t to the one great ma&s;ter, author and founder of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This principle ought even to be more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed up|on the minds of tho&s;e who compo&s;e the collective &s;evereignty than upon tho&s;e of &s;ingle princes. Without in&s;truments, the&s;e princes can do nothing. Whoever u&s;es in&s;truments, in finding helps, finds al&s;o impediments. Their power is therefore by no means compleat; nor are they &s;afe in extreme abu&s;e. Such per&s;ons, per&s;ons, however elevated by flattery, arrogance, and &s;elf-opinion, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that, whether covered or not by po&s;itive law, in &s;ome way or other they are accountable even here for the abu&s;e of their tru&s;t. If they are not cut off by a
<PB N="75" REF="023238_0077_0FBED4F8DC90BA98">
rebellion of their people, they may be &s;trangled by the very Jani&s;&s;aries kept for their &s;ecurity again&s;t all other rebellion. Thus we have &s;een the king of France &s;old by his &s;oldiers for an encrea&s;e of pay. But where popular authority is ab&s;olute and unre&s;trained, the people have an infinitely greater, becau&s;e a far better founded confidence in their own power. They are them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure, their own in&s;truments.</P>
<P>They are nearer to their objects. Be&s;ides, they are le&s;s un|der re&s;pon&s;ibility to one of the greate&s;t controlling powers on earth, the &s;en&s;e of &s;ame and e&s;timation. The &s;hare of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of each individual in public acts, is &s;mall indeed; the operation of opinion being in the inver&s;e ratio to the number of tho&s;e who abu&s;e power. Their own ap|probation of their own acts has to them the apearance of a public judgment in their favour. A perfect democracy is there|fore the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s thing in the world. As it is the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s, it is al&s;o the mo&s;t fearle&s;s. No man apprehends in his per&s;on he can be made &s;ubject to puni&s;hment. Certainly the people at large never ought: for as all puni&s;hments are for example towards the con&s;ervation of the people at large, the people at large can never become the &s;ubject of puni&s;hment by any human hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quicquid multis peccatur inultum.</NOTE>. It is therefore of infinite importance that they &s;hould not be &s;uffered to imagine that their will, any more than that of kings, is the &s;tandard of right and wrong. They ought to be per&s;uaded that they are full as little entitled, and far le&s;s qualified, with &s;afety to them&s;elves, to u&s;e any arbitra|ry power what&s;oever; that therefore they are not, under a fal&s;e &s;hew of liberty, but, in truth, to exerci&s;e an unnatural invert|ed domination, tyrannically to exact, from tho&s;e who officiate in the &s;tate, not an entire devotion to their intere&s;t, which is their right, but an abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their occa&s;ional will; extingui&s;hing thereby, in all tho&s;e who &s;erve them, all moral principle, all &s;en&s;e of dignity, all u&s;e of judgment, and all con&s;i&s;tency of character, whil&s;t by the very &s;ame proce&s;s they give them&s;elves up a proper, a &s;uitable, but a mo&s;t contempti|ble prey to the &s;ervile ambition of popular &s;ycophants or court|ly flatterers.</P>
<P>When the people have emptied them&s;elves of all the lu&s;t of &s;elfi&s;h will, which without religion it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible they ever &s;hould, when they are con&s;cious that they exerci&s;e, and exerci&s;e perhaps in an higher link of the order of delegation, the power, which to be legitimate mu&s;t be according to that eternal immutable law, in which will and rea&s;on are the &s;ame, they will be more careful how they place power in ba&s;e and in|capable hands. In their nomination to office, they will not
<PB N="76" REF="023238_0078_0FBED4FA5A55AB30">
appoint to the exerci&s;e of authority, as to a pitiful job, but as to an holy function; not according to their &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;h in|tere&s;t, nor to their wanton caprice, nor to their arbitrary will; but they will confer that power (which any man may well tremble to give or to receive) on tho&s;e only, in whom they may di&s;cern that predominant proportion of active virtue and wi&s;dom, taken together and fitted to the charge, &s;uch, as in the great and inevitable mixed ma&s;s of human imperfections and infirmities, is to be found.</P>
<P>When they are habitually convinced that no evil can be ac|ceptable, either in the act or the permi&s;&s;ion, to him who&s;e e&s;|&s;ence is good, they will be better able to extirpate out of the minds of all magi&s;trates, civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or military, any thing that bears the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a proud and lawle&s;s domination.</P>
<P>But one of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t leading principles on which the commonwealth and the laws are con&s;ecrated, is le&s;t the tempo|rary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received from their ance&s;tors, or of what is due to their po&s;terity, &s;hould act as if they were the entire ma&s;ters; that they &s;hould not think it among&s;t their rights to cut of the entail or commit wa&s;te on the inheritance, by de&s;troying at their plea|&s;ure the whole original fabric of their &s;ociety; hazarding to leave to tho&s;e who come after them, a ruin in&s;tead of an habi|tation&mdash;and teaching the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as little to re&s;pect their contrivances, as they had them&s;elves re&s;pected the in&s;titutions of their fore-fathers. By this unprincipled facility of changing the &s;tate as often, and as much, and in as many ways as there are floating fancies or fa&s;hions, the whole chain and continuity of the commonwealth would be broken. No one generation could link with the other. Men would become little better than the flies of a &s;ummer.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of all the &s;cience of juri&s;prudence, the pride of the human intellect, which with all its defects, redundancies, and errors, is the collected rea&s;on of ages, combining the prin|ciples of original ju&s;tice with the infinite variety of human concerns, as a heap of old exploded errors, would be no longer &s;tudied. Per&s;onal &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and arrogance (the certain attendants upon all tho&s;e who have never experienced a wi&s;dom greater than their own) would u&s;urp the tribunal. Of cour&s;e, no certain laws, e&s;tabli&s;hing invariable grounds of hope and fear, would keep the actions of men in a certain cour&s;e, or direct them to a certain end. Nothing &s;table in the modes of holding property, or exerci&s;ing function, could form a &s;olid ground on which any parent could &s;peculate in the education of his offspring, or in a choice for their future e&s;tabli&s;hment in
<PB N="77" REF="023238_0079_0FBED4FBDD0E4B20">
the world. No principles would be early worked into the habits. As &s;oon as the mo&s;t able in&s;tructor had compleated his laborious cour&s;e of in&s;titution, in&s;tead of &s;ending forth his pupil, accompli&s;hed in a virtuous di&s;cipline, fitted to procure him attention and re&s;pect, in his place in &s;ociety, he would find every thing altered; and that he had turned out a poor creature to the contempt and deri&s;ion of the world, ignorant of the true grounds of e&s;timation. Who would in&s;ure a tender and delicate &s;en&s;e of honour to beat almo&s;t with the fir&s;t pul&s;es of the heart, when no man could know what would be the te&s;t of honour in a nation, continually varying the &s;tandard of its coin? No part of life would retain its acqui&s;itions. Barbari&s;m with regard to &s;cience and literature, un&s;kilfulne&s;s with regard to arts and manufactures, would infallibly &s;ucceed to the want of a &s;teady education and &s;ettled principle; and thus the com|monwealth it&s;elf would, in a few generations, crumble away, be di&s;connected into the du&s;t and powder of individuality, and at length di&s;per&s;ed to all the winds of heaven.</P>
<P>To avoid therefore the evils of incon&s;tancy and ver&s;atility, ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than tho&s;e of ob&s;tinacy and the blinde&s;t prejudice, we have con&s;ecrated the &s;tate, that no man &s;hould approach to look into defects or corruptions but with due cauti|on; that he &s;hould never dream of beginning its reformation by its &s;ubver&s;ion; that he &s;hould approach to the faults of the &s;tate as to the wounds of a father, with pious awe and tremb|ling &s;ollicitude. By this wi&s;e prejudice we are taught to look with horror on tho&s;e children of their country who are prompt ra&s;hly to hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their poi&s;onous weeds, and wild incantations, they may regenerate the paternal con|&s;titution, and renovate their father's life.</P>
<P>Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts for ob|jects of mere occa&s;ional intere&s;t may be di&s;&s;olved at plea&s;ure&mdash; but the &s;tate ought not to be con&s;idered as nothing better than a partner&s;hip agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, callico or tobacco, or &s;ome other &s;uch low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary intere&s;t, and to be di&s;&s;olved by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with other reverence; be|cau&s;e it is not a partner&s;hip in things &s;ub&s;ervient only to the gro&s;s animal exi&s;tence of a temporary and peri&s;hable nature. It is a partner&s;hip in all &s;cience; a partner&s;hip in all art; a partner&s;hip in every virtue, and in all perfection. As the ends of &s;uch a partner&s;hip cannot be obtained in many ge|nerations, it becomes a partner&s;hip not only between tho&s;e who are living, but between tho&s;e who are living, tho&s;e who are dead, and tho&s;e who are to be born. Each contract
<PB N="78" REF="023238_0080_0FBED4FD59EFC158">
of each particular &s;tate is but a clau&s;e in the great primaeval contract of eternal &s;ociety, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible world, accor|ding to a fixed compact &s;anctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all phy&s;ical and all moral natures, each in their appointed place. This law is not &s;ubject to the will of tho&s;e, who by an obligation above them, and infinitely &s;uperior, are bound to &s;ubmit their will to that law. The municipal corpo|rations of that univer&s;al kingdom are not morally at liberty at their plea&s;ure, and on their &s;peculations of a contingent im|provement, wholly to &s;eparate and tear a&s;under the bands of their &s;ubordinate community, and to di&s;&s;olve it into an un&s;oci|al, uncivil, unconnected chaos of elementary principles. It is the fir&s;t and &s;upreme nece&s;&s;ity only, a nece&s;&s;ity that is not cho&s;en but choo&s;es, a nece&s;&s;ity paramount to deliberation, that admits no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and demands no evidence, which alone can ju&s;tify a re&s;ort to anarchy. This nece&s;&s;ity is no exception to the rule; becau&s;e this nece&s;&s;ity it&s;elf is a part too of that moral and phy&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition of things to which man mu&s;t be obedient by con&s;ent or force; but if that which is only &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould be made the object of choice, the law is broken, nature is obeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, ca&s;t forth, and exiled, from this world of rea&s;on, and order, and peace, and virtue, and fruitful penitence, into the antagoni&s;t world of madne&s;s, di&s;cord, vice, confu&s;ion, and unavailing &s;orrow.</P>

Per&s;uaded that all things ought to be done with reference, and referring all to the point of reference to which all &s;hould be directed, they think them&s;elves bound, not only as individuals in the &s;anctuary of the heart, or as congre|gated

in that per&s;onal capacity, to renew the memory of their high origin and ca&s;t; but al&s;o in their corporate character to perform their national homage to the in&s;titutor, and author and protector of civil &s;ociety; without which civil &s;ociety man could not by any po&s;&s;ibility arrive at the perfection of which his nature is capable, nor even make a remote and faint ap|proach to it. They conceive that He who gave our nature to be perfected by our virtue, willed al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary means of its perfection&mdash;He willed therefore the &s;tate&mdash;He willed its connexion with the &s;ource and original archetype of all per|fection. They who are convinced of this his will, which is the law of laws and the &s;overeign of &s;overeigns, cannot think it re|prehen&s;ible, that this our corporate fealty and homage, that this our recognition of a &s;igniory paramount, I had almo&s;t &s;aid this oblation of the &s;tate it&s;elf, as a worthy offering on the high altar of univer&s;al prai&s;e, &s;hould be performed as all publick &s;olemn acts are performed, in buildings, in mu&s;ick, in decora|tion, in &s;peech, in the dignity of per&s;ons, according to the cu&s;toms of mankind, taught by their nature; that is, with mode&s;t &s;plendour, with una&s;&s;uming &s;tate, with mild maje&s;ty and &s;ober pomp. For tho&s;e purpo&s;es they think &s;ome part of the wealth of the country is as u&s;efully employed as it can be, in fomenting the luxury of individuals. It is the publick orna|ment. It is the publick con&s;olation. It nouri&s;hes the publick hope. The poore&s;t man finds his own importance and dignity in it, whil&s;t the wealth and pride of individuals at every mo|ment makes the man of humble rank and fortune &s;en&s;ible of his inferiority, and degrades and vilifies his condition. It is for the man in humble life, and to rai&s;e his nature, and to put him in mind of a &s;tate in which the privileges of opulence will cea&s;e, when he will be equal by nature, and may be more than equal by virtue, that this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed and &s;anctified.</P>

They do not con&s;ider their church e&s;tabli&s;hment as convenient, but as e&s;&s;ential to their &s;tate; not as a thing heterogeneous and &s;eparable; &s;omething added for accommodation; what they may either keep up or lay a&s;ide, according to their temporary ideas of convenience. They con&s;ider it as the foundation of their whole con&s;titution, with which, and with every part of which, it holds an indi&s;&s;oluble union. Church and &s;tate are ideas in&s;eparable in their minds, and &s;carcely is the one ever mentioned without mentioning the other.</P>
<P>Our education is &s;o formed as to confirm and fix this impre&s;|&s;ion. Our education is in a manner wholly in the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and in all &s;tages from infancy to manhood. Even when our youth, leaving &s;chools and univer&s;ities, enter that mo&s;t important period of life which begins to link experience and &s;tudy together, and when with that view they vi&s;it other countries, in&s;tead of old dome&s;tics whom we have &s;een as go|vernors to principal men from other parts, three-fourths of tho&s;e who go abroad with our young nobility and gentlemen are eccle&s;ia&s;tics; not as au&s;tere ma&s;ters, nor as mere followers; but as friends and companions of a graver character, and not &s;eldom per&s;ons as well born as them&s;elves. With them, as relations, they mo&s;t commonly keep up a clo&s;e connection through life. By this connection we conceive that we attach our gentlemen to the church; and we liberalize the church by an intercour&s;e with the leading characters of the country.</P>
<P>So tenacious are we of the old eccle&s;ia&s;tical modes and fa&s;hi|ons of in&s;titution, that very little alteration has been made in them &s;ince the fourteenth or fifteenth century; adhering in this particular, as in all things el&s;e, to our old &s;ettled maxim, never entirely nor at once to depart from antiquity. We found the&s;e old in&s;titutions, on the whole, favourable to morality and di&s;cipline; and we thought they were &s;u&s;ceptible of amend|ment, without altering the ground. We thought that they were capable of receiving and meliorating, and above all of pre&s;erving the acce&s;&s;ions of &s;cience and literature, as the order of Providence &s;hould &s;ucce&s;&s;ively produce them. And after all, with this Gothic and monki&s;h education (for &s;uch it is in the ground-work) we may put in our claim to as ample and as early a &s;hare in all the improvements in &s;cience, in arts, and in literature, which have illuminated and adorned the modern world, as any other nation in Europe; we think one main cau&s;e of this improvement was our not de&s;pi&s;ing the patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.</P>
<P>It is from our attachment to a church e&s;tabli&s;hment that the Engli&s;h nation did not think it wi&s;e to entru&s;t that great funda|mental

intere&s;t of the whole to what they tru&s;t no part of their civil or military public &s;ervice, that is to the un&s;teady and precarious contribution of individuals. They go further. They certainly never have &s;uffered and never will &s;uffer the fixed e&s;tate of the church to be converted into a pen&s;ion, to depend on the trea&s;ury, and to be delayed, withheld, or perhaps to be extingui&s;hed by fi&s;cal difficulties; which diffiulties may &s;ome|times be pretended for political purpo&s;es, and are in fact often brought on by the extravagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians. The people of England think that they have con&s;titutional motives, as well as religious, again&s;t any project of turning their independent clergy into eccle&s;ia&s;tical pen&s;ioners of &s;tate. They tremble for their liberty, from the influence of a clergy dependent on the crown; they tremble for the public tranquility from the di&s;orders of a factious clergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the crown. They therefore made their church, like their king and their nobility, independent.</P>
<P>From the united con&s;iderations of religion and con&s;titutional policy, from their opinion of a duty to make a &s;ure provi&s;ion for the con&s;olation of the feeble and the in&s;truction of the igno|rant, they have incorporated and identified the e&s;tate of the church with the ma&s;s of <HI>private property,</HI> of which the &s;tate is not the proprietor, either for u&s;e or dominion, but the guar|dian only and the regulator. They have ordained that the provi&s;ion of this e&s;tabli&s;hment might be as &s;table as the earth on which it &s;tands, and &s;hould not fluctuate with the Euripus of funds and actions.</P>
<P>The men of England, the men, I mean, of light and leading in England, who&s;e wi&s;dom (if they have any) is open and direct, would be a&s;hamed, as of a &s;illy deceitful trick, to pro|fe&s;s any religion in name, which by their proceedings they appeared to contemn. If by their conduct (the only language that rarely lies) they &s;eemed to regard the great ruling principle of the moral and the natural world, as a mere invention to keep the vulgar in obedience, they apprehend that by &s;uch a conduct they would defeat the politic purpo&s;e they have in view. They would find it difficult to make others to believe in a &s;y&s;tem to which they manife&s;tly gave no credit them&s;elves. The Chri&s;|tian &s;tate&s;men of this land would indeed fir&s;t provide for the <HI>multitude;</HI> becau&s;e it is the <HI>multitude;</HI> and is therefore, as &s;uch, the fir&s;t object in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical in&s;titution, and in all in&s;ti|tutions. They have been taught, that the circum&s;tance of the go&s;pel's being preached to the poor, was one of the great te&s;ts of its true mi&s;&s;ion. They think, therefore, that tho&s;e do not believe it, who do not take care it &s;hould be preached to the
<PB N="82" REF="023238_0084_0FBED50B9AC8CBD8">
poor. But as they know that charity is not confined to any one de&s;cription, but ought to apply it&s;elf to all men who have wants, they are not deprived of a due and anxious &s;en&s;ation of pity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the mi&s;erable great. They are not re|pelled through a fa&s;tidious delicacy, at the &s;tench of their ar|rogance and pre&s;umption, from a medicinal attention to their mental blotches and running &s;ores. They are &s;en&s;ible, that religious in&s;truction is of more con&s;equence to them than to any others; from the greatne&s;s of the temptation to which they are expo&s;ed; from the important con&s;equences that attend their faults; from the contagion of their ill example; from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of bowing down the &s;tubborn neck of their pride and ambition to the yoke of moderation and virtue; from a con&s;i|deration of the fat &s;tupidity and gro&s;s ignorance concerning what imports men mo&s;t to know, which prevails at courts, and at the head of armies, and in &s;enates, as much as at the loom and in the field.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h people are &s;atisfied, that to the great the con|&s;olations of religion are as nece&s;&s;ary as its in&s;tructions. They too are among the unhappy. They feel per&s;onal pain and do|me&s;tic &s;orrow. In the&s;e they have no privilege, but are &s;ubject to pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mor|tality. They want this &s;overeign balm under their gnawing cares und anxieties, which being le&s;s conver&s;ant about the li|mited wants of animal life, range without limit, and are diver|&s;ified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regi|ons of imagination. Some charitable dole is wanting to the&s;e our often very unhappy brethren, to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear; &s;omething to relieve in the killing languor and over-laboured la&s;&s;itude of tho&s;e who have nothing to do; &s;omething to excite an appetite to exi&s;tence in the palled &s;atiety which attends on all plea&s;ures which may be bought, where nature is not left to her own proce&s;s, where even de&s;ire is anticipated, and there|fore fruition defeated by meditated &s;chemes and contrivances of delight; and no interval, no ob&s;tacle, is interpo&s;ed between the wi&s;h and the accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The people of England know how little influence the teach|ers of religion are likely to have with the wealthy and powerful of long &s;tanding, and how much le&s;s with the newly fortunate, if they appear in a manner no way a&s;&s;orted to tho&s;e with whom they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate, and over whom they mu&s;t even exerci&s;e, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;omething like an authority. What mu&s;t they think of that body of teachers, if they &s;ee it in no part above the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their dome&s;tic &s;ervants? If the poverty were voluntary, there might be &s;ome difference. Strong in|&s;tances

of &s;elf-denial operate powerfully on our minds; and a man who has no wants has obtained great freedom and firm|ne&s;s, and even dignity. But as the ma&s;s of any di&s;cription of men are but men, and their poverty cannot be voluntary, that di&s;re&s;pect which attends upon all Law poverty, will not depart from the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical. Our provident con&s;titution has there|fore taken care that tho&s;e who are to in&s;truct pre&s;umptuous ignorance, tho&s;e who are to be cen&s;ors over in&s;olent vice, &s;hould neither incur their contempt, nor live upon their alms; nor will it tempt the rich to the neglect of the true medicine of their minds. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, whil&s;t we provide fir&s;t for the poor, and with a parental &s;ollicitude, we have not relegated religion (like &s;omething we were a&s;hamed to &s;hew) to ob&s;cure municipalities or ru&s;tic villages. No! We will have her to exalt her mitred front in courts and parliaments. We will have her mixed throughout the whole ma&s;s of life, and blended with all the cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. The people of England will &s;hew to the haughty potentates of the world, and to their talking &s;ophi&s;ters, that a free, a generous, an informed nation, ho|nours the high magi&s;trates of its church; that it will not &s;uffer the in&s;olence of wealth and titles, or any other &s;pecies of proud preten&s;ion, to look down with &s;corn upon what they look up to with reverence; nor pre&s;ume to trample on that acquired per|&s;onal nobility, which they intend always to be, and which often is the fruit, not the reward, (for what can be the reward?) of learning, piety, and virtue. They can &s;ee without pain or grudging, an Archbi&s;hop precede a Duke. They can &s;ee a Bi&s;hop of Durham, or a Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ten thou&s;and pounds a year; and cannot conceive why it is in wor&s;e hands than e&s;tates to the like amount in the hands of this Earl, or that Squire; although it may be true, that &s;o many dogs and hor&s;es are not kept by the former, and fed with the victuals which ought to nouri&s;h the children of the people. It is true, the whole church revenue is not always employed, and to every &s;hilling, in charity; nor perhaps ought it; but &s;ome|thing is generally &s;o employed. It is better to cheri&s;h virtue and humanity, by leaving much to free will, even with &s;ome lo&s;s to the object, than to attempt to make men mere machines and in&s;truments of a political benevolence. The world on the whole will gain by a liberty, without which virtue cannot exi&s;t.</P>
<P>When once the commonwealth has e&s;tabli&s;hed the e&s;tates of the church as property, it can, con&s;i&s;tently, hear nothing of the more or the le&s;s. Too much and too little are trea&s;on a|gain&s;t property. What evil can ari&s;e from the quantity in any hand, whil&s;t the &s;upreme authority has the full, &s;overeign &s;u|perintendance

over this, as over all property, to prevent every &s;pecies of abu&s;e; and, whenever it notably deviates, to give to it a direction agreeable to the purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P>In England mo&s;t of us conceive that it is envy and malignity towards tho&s;e who are often the beginners of their own fortune, and not a love of the &s;elf-denial and mortification of the anti|ent church, that makes &s;ome look a&s;kance at the di&s;tinctions, and honours, and revenues, which, taken from no per&s;on, are &s;et apart for virtue. The ears of the people of England are di&s;tingui&s;hing. They hear the&s;e men &s;peak broad. Their tongue betrays them. Their language is in the <HI>patois</HI> of fraud; in the cant and gibberi&s;h of hypocri&s;y. The people of En|gland mu&s;t think &s;o, when the&s;e praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive evangelic poverty which, in the &s;pirit, ought always to exi&s;t in them, (and in us too, however we may like it) but in the thing mu&s;t be varied, when the re|lation of that body to the &s;tate is altered; when manners, when modes of life, when indeed the whole order of human affairs has undergone a total revolution. We &s;hall believe tho&s;e re|formers to be then hone&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;ts, not as now we think them, cheats and deceivers, when we &s;ee them throwing their own goods into common, and &s;ubmitting their own per&s;ons to the au&s;tere di&s;cipline of the early church.</P>
<P>With the&s;e ideas rooted in their minds, the commons of Great-Britain, in the national emergencies, will never &s;eek their re&s;our&s;e from the confi&s;cation of the e&s;tates of the church and poor. Sacrilege and pro&s;cription are not among the ways and means in our committee of &s;upply. The Jews in Change Alley have not yet dared to hint their hopes of a mortgage on the revenues belonging to the &s;ee of Canterbury. I am not afraid that I &s;hall be di&s;avowed, when I a&s;&s;ure you that there is not <HI>one</HI> public man in this kingdom, whom you would wi&s;h to quote; no not one of any party or de&s;cription, who does not reprobate the di&s;hone&s;t, perfidious, and cruel confi&s;cation which the national a&s;&s;embly has been compelled to make of that pro|perty which it was their fir&s;t duty to protect.</P>
<P>It is with the exultation of a little natural pride I tell you, that tho&s;e among&s;t us who have wi&s;hed to pledge the &s;ocieties of Paris in the cup of their abominations, have been di&s;appointed. The robbery of your church has proved a &s;ecurity to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of ours. It has rou&s;ed the people. They &s;ee with horror and alarm that enormous and &s;hamele&s;s act of pro&s;crip|tion. It has opened, and will more and more open their eyes upon the &s;elfi&s;h enlargement of mind, and the narrow liberality of &s;entiment of in&s;idious men, which commencing in clo&s;e hypocri&s;y and fraud have ended in open violence and rapine.

At home we behold &s;imilar beginnings. We are on our guard again&s;t &s;imilar conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>I hope we &s;hall never be &s;o totally lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of the du|ties impo&s;ed upon us by the law of &s;ocial union, as, upon any pretext of public &s;ervice, to confi&s;cate the goods of a &s;ingle un|offending citizen. Who but a tyrant (a name expre&s;&s;ive of every thing which can vitiate and degrade human nature) could think of &s;eizing on the property of men, unaccu&s;ed, unheard, untried, by whole de&s;criptions, by hundreds and thou&s;ands to|gether? who that had not lo&s;t every trace of humanity could think of ca&s;ting down men of exalted rank and &s;acred function, &s;ome of them of an age to call at once for reverence and com|pa&s;&s;ion, of ca&s;ting them down from the highe&s;t &s;ituation in the commonwealth, wherein they were maintained by their own landed property, to a &s;tate of indigence, depre&s;&s;ion and con|tempt?</P>
<P>The confi&s;cators truly have made &s;ome allowance to their victims from the &s;craps and fragments of their own tables from which they have been &s;o har&s;hly driven, and which have been &s;o bountifully &s;pread for a fea&s;t to the harpiers of u&s;ury. But to drive men from independence to live on alms is it&s;elf great cruelty. That which might be a tolerable condition to men in one &s;tate of life, and not habituated to other things, may, when all the&s;e circum&s;tances are altered, be a dreadful revolution; and one to which a virtuous mind would feel paid in condemn|ing any guilt except that which would demand the life of the offender. But to many minds this puni&s;hment of <HI>degradation</HI> and <HI>infamy</HI> is wor&s;e than death. Undoubtedly it is an infinite aggravation of this cruel &s;uffering, that the per&s;ons who were taught a double prejudice in favour of religion, by education and by the place they held in the admini&s;tration of its functi|ons, are to receive the remnants of their property as alms from the profane and impious hands of tho&s;e who had plundered them of all the re&s;t; to receive, not from the charitable con|tributions of the faithful, but from the in&s;olent tenderne&s;s of known and avowed Athei&s;m, the maintenance of religion, mea&s;ured out to them on the &s;tandard of the contempt in which it is held; and for the purpo&s;e of rendering tho&s;e who receive the allowance vile and of no e&s;timation in the eyes of mankind.</P>
<P>But this act of &s;eizure of property, it &s;eems, is a judgement in law, and not a confi&s;cation. They have, it &s;eems, found out in the academies of the <HI>Palais Royale,</HI> and the <HI>Jacobins,</HI> that certain men had no right to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which they held under law, u&s;age, the deci&s;ions of courts, and the accu|mulated pre&s;cription of a thou&s;and years. They &s;ay that eccle|&s;ia&s;tics are fictitious per&s;ons, creatures of the &s;tate; whom at

plea&s;ure they may de&s;troy, and of cour&s;e limit and modify in every particular; that the goods they po&s;&s;e&s;s are not properly theirs, but belong to the &s;tate which created the fiction; and we are therefore not to trouble our&s;elves with what they may &s;uffer in their natural feelings and natural per&s;ons, on account of what is done towards them in this their con&s;tructive character. Of what import is it, under what names you injure men, and deprive them of the ju&s;t emoluments of a profe&s;&s;ion, in which they were not only permitted but encouraged by the &s;tate to engage; and upon the &s;uppo&s;ed certainty of which emoluments they had formed the plan of their lives, contracted debts, and led multitudes to an entire dependence upon them?</P>
<P>You do not imagine, Sir, that I am going to compliment this mi&s;erable di&s;tinction of per&s;ons with any long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The arguments of tyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful. Had not your confi&s;cators by their early crimes ob|tained a power which &s;ecures imdemnity to all the crimes of which they have &s;ince been guilty, or that they can commit, it is not the &s;yllogi&s;m of the logician but the la&s;h of the exe|cutioner that would have refuted a &s;ophi&s;try which becomes an accomplice of theft and murder. The &s;ophi&s;tick tyrants of Paris are loud in their declamations again&s;t the departed regal tyrants who in former ages have vexed the world. They are thus bold, becau&s;e they are &s;afe from the dungeons and iron cages of their old ma&s;ters. Shall we be more tender of the tyrants of our own time, when we &s;ee them acting wor&s;e tra|gedies under our eyes? &s;hall we not u&s;e the &s;ame liberty that they do, when we can u&s;e it with the &s;ame &s;afety? when to &s;peak hone&s;t truth only requires a contempt of the opinions of tho&s;e who&s;e actions we abhor?</P>
<P>This outrage on all the rights of property was at fir&s;t covered with what, on the &s;y&s;tem of their conduct, was the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing of all pretexts&mdash;a regard to national faith. The ene|mies to property at fir&s;t pretended a mo&s;t tender, delicate, and &s;crupulous anxiety for keeping the king's engagements with the public creditor. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ors of the rights of men are &s;o bu&s;y in teaching others, that they have not lei&s;ure to learn any thing them&s;elves; otherwi&s;e they would have known that it is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the &s;tate, that the fir&s;t and original faith of civil &s;ociety is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, &s;uperior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by acqui&s;ition, or by de&s;cent, or in virtue of a participation in the goods of &s;ome community, where no part of the creditor's &s;ecurity, expre&s;&s;ed or implied. They never &s;o much as entered into his head when

he made his bargain. He well knew that the public, whether repre&s;ented by a monarch, or by a &s;enate, can pledge nothing but the public e&s;tate; and it can have no public e&s;tate, except in what it derives from a ju&s;t and proportioned impo&s;ition upon the citizens at large. This was engaged, and nothing el&s;e could be engaged to the public creditor. No man can mort|gage his inju&s;tice as a pawn for his fidelity.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;ome ob&s;ervation on the contradictions cau&s;ed by the extreme rigour and the extreme laxity of the new public faith, which influenced in this tran&s;action, and which in|fluenced not according to the nature of the obligation, but to the de&s;cription of the per&s;ons to whom it was engaged. No acts of the old government of the kings of France are held valid in the National A&s;&s;embly, except its pecuniary engagements; acts of all others of the mo&s;t ambiguous legality. The re&s;t of the acts of that royal government are con&s;idered in &s;o odious a light, that to have a claim under its authority is looked on as a &s;ort of crime. A pen&s;ion, given as a reward for &s;ervice to the &s;tate, is &s;urely as good a ground of property as any &s;ecurity for money advanced to the &s;tate. It is a better; for money is paid, and well paid, to obtain that &s;ervice. We have however &s;een multitudes of people under this de&s;cription in France, who never had been deprived of their allowances by the mo&s;t arbitrary mini&s;ters, in the mo&s;t arbitrary times, by this a&s;&s;embly of the rights of men, robbed without mercy. They were told, in an&s;wer to their claim to the bread earned with their blood, that their &s;ervices had not been rendered to the country that now exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>This laxity of public faith is not confined to tho&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons. The a&s;&s;embly, with perfect con&s;i&s;tency it mu&s;t be owned, is engaged in a re&s;pectable deliberation how far it is bound by the treaties made with other nations under the former government, and their committee is to report which of them they ought to ratify, and which not. By this means they have put the external fidelity of this virgin &s;tate on a par with its internal.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conceive upon what rational principle the royal government &s;hould not, of the two, rather have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of rewarding &s;ervice, and making treaties, in virtue of its prerogative, than that of pledging to creditors the revenue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tate actual and po&s;&s;ible. The trea&s;ure of the nation, of all things, has been the lea&s;t allowed to the prerogative of the king of France, or to the prerogative of any king in Europe. To mortgage the public revenue implies the &s;overeign dominion, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e, over the public pur&s;e. It goes far beyond the tru&s;t even of a tem|porary and occa&s;ional taxation. The acts however of that dan|gerous power (the di&s;tinctive mark of a boundle&s;s de&s;poti&s;m) have been alone held &s;acred. Whence aro&s;e this preference given by

a democratic a&s;&s;embly to a body of property deriving its title from the mo&s;t critical and obnoxious of all the exertions of monarchical authority? Rea&s;on can furni&s;h nothing to reconcile incon&s;i&s;tency; nor can partial favour be accounted for upon equitable principles. But the contradiction and partiality which admit no ju&s;tification, are not the le&s;s without an adequate cau&s;e; and that cau&s;e I do not think it difficult to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>By the va&s;t debt of France a great monied intere&s;t had in&s;en&s;i|bly grown up, and with it a great power. By the ancient u&s;ages which prevailed in that kingdom, the general circulation of pro|perty, and in particular the mutual convertibility of land into money, and of money into land, had always been a matter of difficulty.

<P>The monied property was long looked on with rather an evil eye by the people. They &s;aw it connected with their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and aggravating them. It was no le&s;s envied by the old landed intere&s;ts, partly for the &s;ame rea&s;ons that rendered it obnoxious to the people, but much more &s;o as it eclip&s;ed, by the &s;plendour of an o&s;tentatious luxury, the unendowed pedigrees and naked titles of &s;everal among the nobility. Even when the nobility, which repre&s;ented the more permanent landed intere&s;t, united them&s;elves by marriage (which &s;ometimes was the ca&s;e) with the other de&s;cription, the wealth which &s;aved the family from ruin was &s;uppo&s;ed to contami|nate and degrade it. Thus the enmities and heart-burnings of the&s;e parties were increa&s;ed even by the u&s;ual means by which di&s;cord is made to cea&s;e, and quarrels are turned into friend&s;hip. In the mean time, the pride of the wealthy men, not noble or newly noble, increa&s;ed with its cau&s;e. They felt with re&s;entment an inferiority, the grounds of which they did not acknowledge. There was no mea&s;ure to which they were not willing to lend them&s;elves, in order to be revenged of the outrages of this rival pride, and to exalt their wealth to what they con&s;idered as its natu|ral rank and e&s;timation. They &s;truck at the nobility through the crown and the church. They attacked them particularly on the &s;ide on which they thought them the mo&s;t vulnerable, that is, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church, which, through the patronage of the crown, generally devolved upon the nobility. The bi&s;hopricks, and the great commendatory abbies, were, with few exceptions, held by that order.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="023238_0091_0FBED52653F0B0C8">In this &s;tate of real, though not always perceived warfare be|tween the noble ancient landed intere&s;t and the new monied in|tere&s;t, the greate&s;t becau&s;e the mo&s;t applicable &s;trength was in the hands of the latter. The monied intere&s;t is in its nature more ready for an adventure, and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors more di&s;po&s;ed to new enterpri&s;es of any kind. Being of a recent acqui&s;ition, it falls in more naturally with any novelties. It is therefore the kind of wealth which will be re&s;orted to by all who wi&s;h for change.</P>
<P>Along with the monied intere&s;t, a new de&s;cription of men had grown up, with whom that intere&s;t &s;oon formed a clo&s;e and marked union; I mean the political men of letters. Men of letters, fond of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, are rarely aver&s;e to innovation. Since the decline of the life and greatne&s;s of Lewis the XIVth, they were not &s;o much cultivated either by him, or by the regent, or the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the crown; nor were they engaged to the court by favours and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">luments &s;o &s;y&s;tematically as during the &s;plendid period of that o&s;tentatious and not impolitic reign. What they lo&s;t in the old court protection they endeavoured to make up by joining in a &s;ort of incorporation of their own; to which the two academies of France, and afterwards the va&s;t undertaking of the Encyclopaedia, carried on by a &s;ociety of the&s;e gentlemen, did not a little contribute.</P>
<P>The literary cabal had &s;ome years ago formed &s;omething like a regular plan for the de&s;truction of the Chri&s;tian religion. This object they pur&s;ued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been di&s;covered only in the propagators of &s;ome &s;y&s;tem of piety. They were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of pro&s;elyti&s;m in the mo&s;t fanatical degree; and from thence by an ea&s;y progre&s;s, with the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution according to their means. What was not to be done towards their great end by any direct or immediate act, might be wrought by a long proce&s;s through the medium of opinion. To command that opinion, the fir&s;t &s;tep is to e&s;tabli&s;h a dominion over tho&s;e who direct it. They contrived to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves, with great method and per&s;everance, of all the avenues to literary fame. Many of them indeed &s;tood high in the ranks of literature and &s;cience. The world had done them ju&s;tice, and in favour of ge|neral talents, forgave the evil tendency of their peculiar principles. This was true liberality, which they returned by endeavouring to confine the reputation of &s;en&s;e, learning, and ta&s;te, to them&s;elves or their followers. I will venture to &s;ay that this narrow, exclu|&s;ive &s;pirit, has not been le&s;s prejudicial to literature and to ta&s;te, than to morals and true philo&s;ophy. The&s;e Athei&s;tical fathers have a bigotry of their own; and they have learnt to talk again&s;t monks with the &s;pirit of a monk. But in &s;ome things they are men of the world. The re&s;ources of intrigue are called in to &s;upply the defects of argument and wit. To this &s;y&s;tem of literary monopoly

was joined an unremitting indu&s;try to blacken and di&s;credit in every way, and by every means, all tho&s;e who did not hold to their faction. To tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved the &s;pirit of their conduct, it has long been clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a per|&s;ecution which would &s;trike at property, liberty, and life.</P>
<P>The de&s;ultory and faint per&s;ecution carried on again&s;t them, more from compliance with form and decency than with &s;erious re&s;entment, neither weakened their &s;trength, nor relaxed their efforts. The i&s;&s;ue of the whole was, that what with oppo&s;ition, and what with &s;ucce&s;s, a violent and malignant zeal, of a kind hitherto unknown in the world, had taken an entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their minds, and rendered their whole conver&s;ation, which other|wi&s;e would have been plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive, perfectly di&s;gu&s;ting. A &s;pirit of cabal, intrigue, and pro&s;elyti&s;m, pervaded all their thoughts, words, and actions. And, as controver&s;ial zeal &s;oon turns its thoughts on force, they began to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into a corre&s;pondence with foreign princes; in hopes, through their au|thority, which at fir&s;t they flattered, they might bring about the changes they had in view. To them it was indifferent whether the&s;e changes were to be accompli&s;hed by the thunderbolt of de&s;|poti&s;m, or by the earthquake of popular commotion. The cor|re&s;pondence between this cabal, and the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, will throw no &s;mall light upon the &s;pirit of all their proceedings. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e for which they intrigued with princes, they cul|tivated, in a di&s;tingui&s;hed manner, the monied intere&s;t of France; and partly through the means furni&s;hed by tho&s;e who&s;e peculiar of|fices gave them the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and certain means of communi|cation, they carefully occupied all the avenues to opinion.</P>
<P>Writers, e&s;pecially when they act in a body, and with one di|rection, have great influence on the public mind; the alliance therefore of the&s;e writers with the monied intere&s;t had no &s;mall ef|fect in removing the popular odium and envy which attended that &s;pecies of wealth. The&s;e writers, like the propagators of all no|velties, pretended to a great zeal for the poor, and the lower orders, whil&s;t in their &s;atires they rendered hateful, by every exaggeration, the faults of courts, of nobility, and of prie&s;thood. They became a &s;ort of demagogues. They &s;erved as a link to unite, in favour of one object, obnoxious wealth to re&s;tle&s;s and de&s;perate poverty.</P>
<P>As the&s;e two kinds of men appear principal leaders in all the late tran&s;actions, their junction and politics will &s;erve to account, not upon any principles of law or of policy, but as a <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> for the general fury with which all the landed property of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical corporations has been attacked; and the great care which, contrary to their pretended principles, has been taken, of a monied intere&s;t originating from the authority of the crown. All the

envy again&s;t wealth and power, was artificially directed again&s;t other de&s;criptions of riches. On what other principles than that which I have &s;tated, can we account for an appearance &s;o extraor|dinary and unnatural as that of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which had &s;tood &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of ages and &s;hocks of civil violences, and were guarded at once by ju&s;tice and by prejudice, being ap|plied to the payment of debts, comparatively recent, invidious, and contracted by a decried and &s;ubverted government?</P>
<P>Was the public e&s;tate a &s;ufficient &s;take for the public debts? A&s;&s;ume that it was not, and that a lo&s;s <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be incurred &s;ome|where&mdash;When the only e&s;tate lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which the contracting parties had in contemplation at the time in which their bargain was made, happens to fail, who, according to the prin|ciples of natural and legal equity, ought to be the &s;ufferer? Cer|tainly it ought to be either the party who tru&s;ted, or the party who per&s;uaded him to tru&s;t, or both; and not third parties who had no concern with the tran&s;action. Upon any in&s;olvency, they ought to &s;uffer who were weak enough to lend upon bad &s;ecurity, or they who fraudulently held out a &s;ecurity that was not valid. Laws are acquainted with no other rules of deci&s;ion. But by the new in&s;titute of the rights of men, the only per&s;ons who in equity ought to &s;uffer, are the only per&s;ons who are to be &s;aved harmle&s;s: tho&s;e are to an&s;wer the debt who neither were lenders or borrow|ers, mortgagers or mortgagees.</P>
<P>What had the clergy to do with the&s;e tran&s;actions? What had they to do with any public engagement further than the extent of their own debt? To that, to be &s;ure, their e&s;tates were bound to the la&s;t acre. Nothing can lead more to the true &s;pirit of the a&s;|&s;embly which &s;its for public confi&s;cation, with its new equity and its new morality, than an attention to their proceeding with regard to this debt of the clergy. The body of confi&s;cators, true to that monied intere&s;t for which they were fal&s;e to every other, have found the clergy competent to incur a legal debt. Of cour&s;e, they declared them legally entitled to the property which their power of incurring the debt and mortgaging the e&s;tate implied; recog|nizing the rights of tho&s;e per&s;ecuted citizens, in the very act in which they were thus gro&s;sly violated.</P>
<P>If, as I &s;aid, any per&s;ons are to make good deficiencies to the public creditor, be&s;ides the public at large, they mu&s;t be tho&s;e who managed the agreement.

the jobbing of the public funds. Or, if you mu&s;t confi&s;cate old landed e&s;tates in favour of the money-jobbers, why is the penalty confined to one de&s;cription? I do not know whether the expences of the duke de Choi&s;eul have left any thing of the infinite &s;ums which he had derived from the bounty of his ma&s;ter, during the tran&s;actions of a reign which contributed largely, by every &s;pecies of prodigality in war and peace, to the pre&s;ent debt of France. If any &s;uch remains, why is not this confi&s;cated? I remember to have been in Paris during the time of the old government. I was there ju&s;t after the duke d'Aiguillon had been &s;natched (as it was generally thought) from the block by the hand of a protecting di&s;poti&s;m. He was a mini&s;ter, and had &s;ome concern in the affairs of that prodigal period. Why do I not &s;ee his e&s;tate delivered up to the muni|cipalities in which it is &s;ituated? The noble family of Noailles have long been &s;ervants, (meritorious &s;ervants I admit) to the crown of France, and have had of cour&s;e &s;ome &s;hare in its bounties. Why do I hear nothing of the application of their e&s;tates to the public debt? Why is the e&s;tate of the duke de Rochefoucault more &s;acred than that of the cardinal de Roche|foucault? The former is, I doubt not, a worthy per&s;on; and (if it were not a &s;ort of profanene&s;s to talk of the u&s;e, as affecting the title to property) he makes a good u&s;e of his re|venues; but it is no di&s;re&s;pect to him to &s;ay, what authentic information well warrants me in &s;aying, that the u&s;e made of a property equally valid, by his brother the cardinal archbi&s;hop of Rouen, was far more laudible and far more public-&s;pirited. Can one hear of the pro&s;cription of &s;uch per&s;ons, and the con|fi&s;cation of their effects, without indignation and horror? He is not a man who does not feel &s;uch emotions on &s;uch occa&s;ions. He does not de&s;erve the name of a free man who will not expre&s;s them.</P>
<P>Few barbarous conquerors have ever made &s;o terrible a revolu|tion in property. None of the heads of the Roman factions, when they e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>"crudelem illam Ha&s;tam"</HI> in all their auctions of rapine, have ever &s;et up to &s;ale the goods of the conquered citizen to &s;uch an enormous amount. It mu&s;t be allowed in favour of tho&s;e tyrants of antiquity, that what was done by them could hardly be &s;aid to be done in cold blood. Then pa&s;&s;ions were inflamed, their tempers &s;oured, their under&s;tand|ings confu&s;ed, with the &s;pirit of revenge, with the innumerable reciprocated and recent inflictions and retaliations of blood and rapine. They were driven beyond all bounds of moderation by the apprehen&s;ion of the return of power with the return of property to the families of tho&s;e they had injured beyond all hope of forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="023238_0095_0FBED531C35C07F8">The&s;e Roman confi&s;cators, who were yet only in the elements of tyranny, and were not in&s;tructed in the rights of men to exerci&s;e all &s;orts of cruelties on each other without provocation, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pread a &s;ort of colour over their inju&s;tice. They con&s;idered the vanqui&s;hed party as compo&s;ed of traitors who had borne arms, or otherwi&s;e had acted with ho&s;tility again&s;t the commonwealth. They regarded them as per&s;ons who had forfeited their property by their crimes. With you, in your improved &s;tate of the human mind, there was no &s;uch formality. You &s;eized upon five millions &s;terling of annual rent, and turned forty or fifty thou&s;and human creatures out of their hou&s;es, becau&s;e "&s;uch was your plea&s;ure." The tyrant, Harry the Eighth of England, as he was not better enlightened than the Roman Marius's and Sylla's, and had not &s;tudied in your new &s;chools, did not know what an effectual in&s;trument of de&s;|poti&s;m was to be found in that grand magazine of offen&s;ive weapons, the rights of men. When he re&s;olved to rob the abbies, as the club of the Jacobins have robbed all the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics, he began by &s;etting on foot a commi&s;&s;ion to examine into the crimes and abu&s;es which prevailed in tho&s;e communities. As it might be expected, his commi&s;&s;ion reported truths, ex|aggerations, and fal&s;ehoods. But truly or fal&s;ely it reported abu&s;es and offences. However, as abu&s;es might be corrected, as every crime of per&s;ons does not infer a forfeiture with regard to communities, and as property, in that dark age, was not di&s;covered to be a creature of prejudice, all tho&s;e abu&s;es (and there were enough of them) were hardly thought &s;ufficient ground for &s;uch a confi&s;cation as it was for his purpo&s;es to make. He therefore procured the formal &s;urrender of the&s;e e&s;tates. All the&s;e opero&s;e proceedings were adopted by one of the mo&s;t decided tyrants in the rolls of hi&s;tory, as nece&s;&s;ary prelimina|ries, before he could venture, by bribing the members of his two &s;ervile hou&s;es with a &s;hare of the &s;poil, and holding out to them an eternal immunity from taxation, to demand a con|firmation of his iniquitous proceedings by an act of parliament.

But was the &s;tate of France &s;o wretched and undone, that no other re&s;ource but rapine remain|ed to pre&s;erve its exi&s;tence? On this point I wi&s;h to receive &s;ome information.

If &s;uch an equal impo&s;ition would have been &s;uf|ficient, you well know it might ea&s;ily have been made.

<P>If we give credit to him, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to have re|cour&s;e to any new impo&s;itions what&s;oever, to put the receipts of France on a balance with its expences. He &s;tated the per|manent charges of all de&s;criptions, including the intere&s;t of a new loan of four hundred millions, at 531,444,000 livres; the fixed revenue at 475,294,000, making the deficiency 56,150, 000, or &s;hort of 2,200,000 &s;terling. But to balance it, he brought forward &s;avings and improvements of revenue (con&s;i|dered as entirely certain) to rather more than the amount of that deficiency; and he concludes with the&s;e emphatical words (p. 39) <Q>Quel pays, Me&s;&s;ieurs, que celui, ou <HI>&s;ans imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> et avec de &s;imples objets <HI>inappercus,</HI> on peut faire di&s;paroitre un deficit qui a fait tant de bruit en Europe.</Q> As to the re|imbur&s;ement, the &s;inking of debt, and the other great objects of public credit and political arrangement indicated in Mon&s;. Neckar's &s;peech, no doubt could be entertained, but that a very moderate and proportioned a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on the citizens without di&s;tinction, would have provided for all of them to the fulle&s;t extent of their demand.</P>
<P>If this repre&s;entation of Mon&s;. Neckar was fal&s;e, then the a&s;&s;embly are in the highe&s;t degree culpable for having forced the king to accept as his mini&s;ter, and &s;ince the king's depo|&s;ition, for having employed as <HI>their</HI> mini&s;ter, a man who had been capable of abu&s;ing &s;o notoriou&s;ly the confidence of his ma&s;ter and their own; in a matter too of the highe&s;t moment, and directly appertaining to his particular office. But if the repre&s;entation was exact (as, having always along with you conceived a high degree of re&s;pect for Mr. Neckar, I make no doubt it was) then what can be &s;aid in favour of tho&s;e, who, in&s;tead of moderate, rea&s;onable, and general contribution, have in cold blood, and impelled by no nece&s;&s;ity, had recour&s;e to a partial and cruel confi&s;cation?</P>

Let us allow that all the re&s;ources he oppo&s;ed to that deficiency were impudent and groundle&s;s fictions; and that the a&s;&s;embly (or their lords of articles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the con&s;titution of Scotland during the Stuart reigns, a committee &s;et for preparing bills; and none could pa&s;s, but tho&s;e previou&s;ly approved by them. This committee was called lords of articles.</NOTE> at the Jacobins) were from thence ju&s;tified in laying the whole burthen of that deficiency on the clergy,&mdash;yet allowing all this, a nece&s;&s;ity of &pound;. 2,200, 000 &s;terling will not &s;upport a confi&s;cation to the amount of five millions. The impo&s;ition of &pound;. 2,200,000 on the clergy, as partial, would have been oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t, but it would not have been altogether ruinous to tho&s;e on whom it was impo&s;ed; and therefore it would not have an&s;wered the real purpo&s;e of the managers.</P>
<P>Perhaps per&s;ons, unacquainted with the &s;tate of France, on hearing the clergy and noble&s;&s;e were privileged in point of taxation, may be led to imagine, that previous to the revolu|tion the&s;e bodies had contributed nothing to the &s;tate. This is a great mi&s;take. They certainly did not contribute equally with each other, nor either of them equally with the commons. They both however contributed largely. Neither nobility nor clergy enjoyed any exemption from the exci&s;e on con&s;umable commodities, from duties of cu&s;tom, or from any of the other numerous <HI>indirect</HI> impo&s;itions, which in France as well as here, make &s;o very large a proportion of all payments to the public. The noble&s;&s;e paid the capitation. They paid al&s;o a land tax, called the twentieth penny, to the height &s;ometimes of three, &s;ometimes of four &s;hillings in the pound; both of them <HI>direct</HI> impo&s;itions of no light nature, and no trivial produce. The clergy of the provinces annexed by conque&s;t to France (which in extent make about an eighth part of the whole, but in wealth a much larger proportion) paid likewi&s;e to the capitation and the twentieth penny, at the rate paid by the nobility. The clergy in the old provinces did not pay the capitation; but they had redeemed them&s;elves at the expence of 24 millions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r a little more than a million &s;terling. They were exempted from the twentieths; but then they made free gifts; they contracted
<PB N="97" REF="023238_0099_0FBED53D28704B80">
debts for the &s;tate; and they were &s;ubject to &s;ome other charges the whole computed at about a thirteenth part of their clear income. They ought to have paid annually about forty thou&s;and pounds more, to put them on a par with the contribution of the nobility.</P>
<P>When the terrors of this tremen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us pro&s;cription hung over the clergy, they made an offer of a contribution, through the archbi&s;hop of Aix, which, for its extravagance, ought not to have been accepted. But it was evidently and obviou&s;ly more advantageous to the public creditor, than any thing which could rationally be promi&s;ed by the confi&s;cation. Why was it not accepted? The rea&s;on is plain&mdash;There was no de&s;ire that the church &s;hould be brought to &s;erve the &s;tate. The &s;ervice of the &s;tate was made a pretext to de&s;troy the church. One great end in the project would have been defeated, if the plan of extortion had been adopted in lieu of the &s;cheme of confi&s;cation. The new landed intere&s;t connected with the new republic, and con|nected with it for its very being, could not have been created. This was the rea&s;on why that extravagant ran&s;om was not accepted.</P>
<P>The madne&s;s of the project of confi&s;cation, on the plan that was fir&s;t pretended, &s;oon became apparent. To bring this unwieldy ma&s;s of landed property, enlarged by the confi&s;cation of all the va&s;t landed domain of the crown, at once into market, was obviou&s;ly to defeat the profits propo&s;ed by the confi&s;cation, by depreciating the value of tho&s;e lands, and indeed of all the landed e&s;tates throughout France. Such a &s;udden diver&s;ion of all its circulating money from trade to land, mu&s;t be an additi|onal mi&s;chief. What &s;tep was taken? Did the a&s;&s;embly, on becoming &s;en&s;ible of the inevitable ill effects of their projected &s;ale, revert to the offers of the clergy? No di&s;tre&s;s could oblige them to travel in a cour&s;e which was di&s;graced by any appear|ance of ju&s;tice. Giving over all hopes from a general imme|diate &s;ale, another project &s;eems to have &s;ucceeded. They propo&s;ed to take &s;tock in exchange for the church lands. In that project great difficulties aro&s;e in equalizing the objects to be exchanged, Other ob&s;tacles al&s;o pre&s;ented them&s;elves, which threw them back again upon &s;ome project of &s;ale. The muni|cipalities had taken an alarm. They would not hear of tran&s;|ferring the whole plunder of the kingdom to the &s;tock-holders in Paris. Many of tho&s;e municipalities had been (upon &s;y&s;tem) reduced to the mo&s;t deplorable indigence. Money was no where to be &s;een. They were therefore led to the point that was &s;o ardently de&s;ired. They panted for a currency of any kind which might revive their peri&s;hing indu&s;try. The muni|cipalities were then to be admitted to a &s;hare in the &s;poil, which
<PB N="98" REF="023238_0100_0FBED54151E38378">
evidently rendered the fir&s;t &s;cheme (if ever it had been &s;eriou&s;ly entertained) altogether impracticable. Public exigencies pre&s;&s;ed upon all &s;ides. The mini&s;ter of finance reiterated his call for &s;upply with a mo&s;t urgent, anxious, and boding voice. Thus pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, in&s;tead of the fir&s;t plan of converting their bankers into bi&s;hops and abbots, in&s;tead of paying the old debt, they contracted a new debt, at 3 per cent. creating a new paper currency, founded on an eventual &s;ale of the church lands. They i&s;&s;ued this paper currency to &s;atisfy in the fir&s;t in&s;tance chiefly the demands made upon them by the <HI>Bank of di&s;count,</HI> the great machine, or paper-mill, of their fictitious wealth.</P>
<P>The &s;poil of the church was now become the only re&s;ource of all their operations in finance; the vital principle of all their politics; the &s;ole &s;ecurity for the exi&s;tence of their power. It was nece&s;&s;ary by all, even the mo&s;t violent means, to put every individual on the &s;ame bottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty intere&s;t to uphold this act, and the authority of tho&s;e by whom it was done. In order to force the mo&s;t reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rend red their paper circu|lation compul&s;ory in all payments. Tho&s;e who con&s;ider the general tendency of their &s;chemes to this one object as a centre; and a centre from which afterwards all their mea&s;ures radiate, will not think that I dwell too long upon this part of the pro|ceedings of the national a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>To cut off all appearance of connexion between the crown and public ju&s;tice, and to bring the whole under implicit obedi|ence to the dictators in Paris, the old independent judicature of the parliaments, with all its merits, and all its faults, was wholly aboli&s;hed. Whil&s;t the parliaments exi&s;ted, it was evi|dent that the people might &s;ome time or other come to re&s;ort to them, and rally under the &s;tandard of their antient laws. It became however a matter of con&s;ideration that the magi&s;trates and officers, in the courts now aboli&s;hed, <HI>had purcha&s;ed their places</HI> at a very high rate, for which, as well as for the duty they performed, they received but a very low return of intere&s;t. Simple confi&s;cation is a boon only for the clergy;&mdash;to the lawyers &s;ome appearances of equity are to be ob&s;erved; and they are to receive compen&s;ation to an immen&s;e amount. Their compen&s;ation becomes part of the national debt, for the liquida|tion of which there is the one exhau&s;tle&s;s fund. The lawyers are to obtain their compen&s;ation in the new church paper, which is to march with the new principles of judicature and le|gi&s;lature. The di&s;mi&s;&s;ed magi&s;trates are to take their &s;hare of martyrdom with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, or to receive their own pro|perty from &s;uch a fund and in &s;uch a manner, as all tho&s;e, who
<PB N="99" REF="023238_0101_0FBED54303D69EC8">
have been &s;ea&s;oned with the antient principles of juri&s;prudence, and had been the &s;worn guardians of property, mu&s;t look upon with horror. Even the clergy are to receive their mi&s;erable allowance out of the depreciated paper which is &s;tamped with the indelible character of &s;acrilege, and with the &s;ymbols of their own ruin, or they mu&s;t &s;tarve. So violent an outrage upon credit, property, and liberty, as this compul&s;ory paper curren|cy, has &s;eldom been exhibited by the allience of bankruptcy and tyranny, at any time, or in any nation.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of all the&s;e operations, at length comes out the grand <HI>arcanum;</HI>&mdash;that in reality, and in a fair &s;en&s;e, the lands of the church (&s;o far as any thing certain can be gathered from their proceedings) are not to be &s;old at all. By the late re&s;o|lutions of the national a&s;&s;embly, they are indeed to be delivered to the highe&s;t bidder. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that <HI>a certain portion only of the purcha&s;e money is to be laid down.</HI> A period of twelve years is to be given for the payment of the re&s;t. The philo&s;ophic purcha&s;ers are therefore, on payment of a &s;ort of fine, to be put in&s;tantly into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate. It becomes in &s;ome re&s;pects a &s;ort of gift to them; to be held on the feudal tenure of zeal to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. This project is evi|dently to let in a body of purcha&s;ers without money. The con|&s;equence will be, that the&s;e purcha&s;ers, or rather grantees, will pay, not only from the rents as they accrue, which might as well be received by the &s;tate, but from the &s;poil of the materials of buildings, from wa&s;te in woods, and from whatever money, by hands habituated to the gripings of u&s;ury, they can wring from the mi&s;erable pea&s;ant. He is to be delivered over to the mercenary and arbitrary di&s;cretion of men, who will be &s;timu|lated to every &s;pecies of extortion by the growing demands on the growing profits of an e&s;tate held under the precarious &s;ettle|ment of a new political &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>When all the frauds, impo&s;tures, violences, rapines, burn|ings, murders, confi&s;cations, compul&s;ory paper currencies, and every de&s;cription of tyranny and cruelty employed to bring about and to uphold this revolution, have their natural effect, that is, to &s;hock the moral &s;entiments of all virtuous and &s;ober minds, the abettors of this philo&s;ophic &s;y&s;tem immediately &s;train their throats in a declamation again&s;t the old monarchial government of France. When they have rendered that depo|&s;ed power &s;ufficiently black, they then proceed in argument, as if all tho&s;e who di&s;approve of their new abu&s;es, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be partizans of the old; that tho&s;e who reprobate their crude and violent &s;chemes of liberty ought to be treated as advocates for &s;ervitude. I admit that their nece&s;&s;ities do compel them to this ba&s;e and contemptible fraud. Nothing can reconcile

men to their proceedings and projects but the &s;uppo&s;ition that there is no third option between them, and &s;ome tyranny as odious as can be furni&s;hed by the records of hi&s;tory, or by the invention of poets. This prattling of theirs hardly de&s;erves the name of &s;ophi&s;try. It is nothing but plain impudence. Have the&s;e gentlemen never heard, in the whole circle of the worlds of theory and practice, of any thing between the de&s;|poti&s;m of the monarch and the de&s;poti&s;m of the multitude? Have they never heard of a monarchy directed by laws, con|trolled and ballanced by the great hereditary wealth and here|ditary dignity of a nation; and both again controlled by a judi|cious check from the rea&s;on and feeling of the people at large acting by a &s;uitable and permanent organ? Is it then impo&s;&s;i|ble that a man may be found who, without criminal ill inten|tion, or pitiable ab&s;urdity, &s;hall prefer &s;uch a mixed and tem|pered government to either of the extremes; and who may repute that nation to be de&s;titute of all wi&s;dom and of all virtue which, having in its choice to obtain &s;uch a government with ea&s;e, <HI>or rather to confirm it when actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> thought pro|per to commit a thou&s;and crimes, and to &s;ubject their country to a thou&s;and evils, in order to avoid it? Is it then a truth &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, that a pure democracy is the only tolerable form into which human &s;ociety can be thrown, that a man is not permitted to he&s;itate about its merits, without the &s;u&s;picion of being a friend to tyranny, that is, of being a foe to mankind?</P>
<P>I do not know under what de&s;cription to cla&s;s the pre&s;ent ruling authority in France. It affects to be a pure democracy, though I think it in a direct train of becoming &s;hortly a mi&s;|chievous and ignoble oligarchy. But for the pre&s;ent I admit it to be a contrivance of the nature and effect of what it pretends to. I reprobate no form of government merely upon ab&s;tract principles. There may be &s;ituations in which the purely de|mocratic form will become nece&s;&s;ary. There may be &s;ome (very few, and very particularly circum&s;tanced) where it would be clearly de&s;ireable. This I do not take to be the ca&s;e of France, or of any other great country. Until now, we have &s;een no examples of con&s;iderable democracies. The antients were better acquainted with them. Not being wholly unread in the authors, who had &s;een the mo&s;t of tho&s;e con&s;titutions, and who be&s;t under&s;tood them, I cannot help concurring with their opinion, that an ab&s;olute democracy, no more than ab&s;o|lute monarchy, is to be reckoned among the ligitimate forms of government. They think it rather the corruption and dege|neracy, than the &s;ound con&s;titution of a republic. If I recol|lect rightly, Ari&s;totle ob&s;erves, that a democracy has many

&s;triking points of re&s;emblance with a tyranny <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When I wrote this I quoted from memory, after many years had elap&s;ed from my reading the pa&s;&s;age. A learned friend has found it, and it is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Mores iidem &s;unt, ambo civibus melioribus dominantur; in uno, Plebi&s;cita, decretis mandati&s;que in altero congruunt.

<P><Q>The ethical character is the &s;ame; both exerci&s;e de&s;poti&s;m over the better cla&s;s of citizens; and decrees are in the one, what ordinances and arr&ecirc;ts are in the other: the demagogue too, and the court favourite, are not unfrequently the &s;ame identical men, and always bear a clo&s;e analogy; and the&s;e have the principal power, each in their re&s;pective forms of government, favourites with the ab&s;olute monarch, and demagogues with a people &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed.</Q> <BIBL>Ari&s;t. Politic. lib. iv. cap. 4.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. Of this I am certain, that in a democracy, the majority of the citizens is capable of exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;&s;ions upon the mino|rity, whenever &s;trong divi&s;ions prevail in that kind of polity, as they often mu&s;t; and that oppre&s;&s;ion of the minority will extend to far greater numbers, and will be carried on with much greater fury, than can almo&s;t ever be apprehended from the dominion of a &s;ingle &s;ceptre. In &s;uch a popular per&s;ecuti|on, individual &s;ufferers are in a much more deplorable condi|tion than in any other. Under a cruel prince they have the balmy compa&s;&s;ion of mankind to a&s;&s;uage the &s;mart of their wounds; they have the plaudits of the people to animate their generous con&s;tancy under their &s;ufferings: but tho&s;e who are &s;ubjected to wrong under multitudes, are deprived of all exter|nal con&s;olation. They &s;eem de&s;erted by mankind; overpow|ered by a con&s;piracy of their whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>But admitting democracy not to have that inevitable ten|dency to party tyranny, which I &s;uppo&s;e it to have, and ad|mitting it to po&s;&s;e&s;s as much good in it when unmixed, as I am &s;ure it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es when compounded with other forms; does monarchy, on its part, contain nothing at all to recommend it? I do not often quote Bolingbroke, nor have his works in gene|ral, left any permanent impre&s;&s;ion on my mind. He is a pre|&s;umptuous and a &s;uperficial writer. But he has one ob&s;ervation, which in my opinion, is not without depth and &s;olidity. He &s;ays, that he prefers a monarchy to other governments; be|cau&s;e you can better ingraft any de&s;cription of republic on a monarchy than any thing of monarchy upon the republican forms. I think him perfectly in the right. The fact is &s;o hi&s;torically; and it agrees well with the &s;peculation.</P>

They will judge of human in&s;titutions as they do of human characters. They will &s;ort out the good from the evil, which is mixed in mortal in&s;titutions as it is in mortal men.</P>
<P>Your government in France, though u&s;ually, and I think ju&s;tly, reputed the be&s;t of the unqualified or ill-qualified monar|chies, was &s;till full of abu&s;es. The&s;e abu&s;es accumulated in a length of time, as they mu&s;t accumulate in every monarchy not under the con&s;tant in&s;pection of a popular repre&s;entative. I am no &s;tranger to the faults and defects of the &s;ubverted go|vernment of France; and I think I am not inclined by nature or policy to make a panegyric upon any thing which is a ju&s;t and natural object of cen&s;ure. But the que&s;tion is not now of the vices of that monarchy, but of its exi&s;tence. Is it then true, that the French government was &s;uch as to be incapable or unde&s;erving of reform; &s;o that it was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity the whole fabric &s;hould be at once pulled down, and the area cleared for the erection of a theoretic experimental edifice in its place? All France was of a different opinion in the begin|ning of the year 1789. The in&s;tructions to the repre&s;entatives to the &s;tates-general, from every di&s;trict in that kingdom, were filled with projects for the reformation of that government, without the remote&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of a de&s;ign to de&s;troy it. Had &s;uch a de&s;ign been then even in&s;inuated, I believe there would have been but one voice, and that voice for rejecting it with &s;corn and horror. Men have been &s;ometimes led by degrees, &s;ometimes hurried into things, the whole of which, if they could have &s;een together, they never would have permitted the mo&s;t remote approach. When tho&s;e in&s;tructions were given, there was no que&s;tion but that abu&s;es exi&s;ted, and that they de|manded a reform; nor is there now. In the interval between the in&s;tructions and the revolution, things changed their &s;hape; and in con&s;equence of that change, the true que&s;tion at pre&s;ent is, Whether tho&s;e who would have reformed, or tho&s;e who have de&s;troyed, are in the right?</P>
<P>To hear &s;ome men &s;peak of the late monarchy of France, you would imagine that they were talking of Per&s;ia bleeding under the ferocious &s;word of Taehmas Kouli Kh&acirc;n; or at lea&s;t de&s;cribing the barbarous anarchic de&s;poti&s;m of Turkey, where the fine&s;t countries in the mo&s;t genial climates in the world are wa&s;ted by peace more than any countries have been worried by war; where arts are unknown, where manufactures langui&s;h,
<PB N="103" REF="023238_0105_0FBED54C2F4F86C8">
where &s;cience is extingui&s;hed, where agriculture decays, where the human race it&s;elf melts away and peri&s;hes under the eye of the ob&s;erver. Was this the ca&s;e of France? I have no way of determining the que&s;tion but by a reference to facts. Facts do not &s;upport this re&s;emblance. Along with much evil, there is &s;ome good in monarchy it&s;elf; and &s;ome corrective to its evil, from religion, from laws, from manners, from opinions, the French monarchy mu&s;t have received; which rendered it (though by no means a free, and therefore by no means a good con&s;titution) a de&s;poti&s;m rather in appearance than in reality.</P>
<P>Among the &s;tandards upon which the effects of government on any country are to be e&s;timated, I mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;tate of its population as not the lea&s;t certain. No country in which population flouri&s;hes, and is in progre&s;&s;ive improvement, can be under a <HI>very</HI> mi&s;chievous government. About &s;ixty years ago, the Intendants of the generalities of France made, with other matters, a report of the population of their &s;everal di&s;tricts. I have not the books, which are very voluminous, by me, nor do I know where to procure them (I am obliged to &s;peak by memory, and therefore the le&s;s po&s;itively) but I think the population of France was by them, even at that period, e&s;timated at twenty-two millions of &s;ouls. At the end of the la&s;t century it had been generally calculated at eighteen. On either of the&s;e e&s;timations France was not ill-peopled. Mr. Necker, who is an authority for his own time at lea&s;t equal to the Intendants for theirs, reckons, and upon apparently &s;ure principles, the people of France, in the year 1780, at twenty-four millions &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and. But was this the probable ultimate term under the old e&s;tabli&s;hment? Dr. Price is of opinion, that the growth of population in France was by no means at its <HI>acm&eacute;</HI> in that year. I certainly defer to Dr. Price's authority a good deal more in the&s;e &s;peculations, than I do in his general politics. This gentleman, taking ground on Mr. Necker's data, is very confident, that &s;ince the period of that mini&s;ter's calculation, the French population has increa&s;ed rapidly; &s;o rapidly that in the year 1789 he will not con&s;ent to rate the people of that kingdom at a lower num|ber than thirty millions. After abating much (and much I think ought to be abated) from the &s;anguine calculation of Dr. Price, I have no doubt that the population of France did encrea&s;e con&s;iderably during this latter period: but &s;uppo&s;ing that it encrea&s;ed to nothing more than will be &s;ufficient to compleat the 24,670,000 to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5 millions, &s;till a population of 25 millions, and that in an increa&s;ing progre&s;s, on a &s;pace of about twenty-&s;even thou&s;and &s;quare leagues, is immen&s;e. It is, for in&s;tance, a good deal more than the proportionable po|pulation

of this i&s;land, or even than that of England, the be&s;t-peopled part of the united kingdom.</P>
<P>It is not univer&s;ally true, that France is a fertile country. Con&s;iderable tracts of it are barren, and labour under other natural di&s;advantage. In the portions of that territory, where things are more favourable, as far as I am able to di&s;cover, the numbers of the people corre&s;pond to the indulgence of nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De l'Admini&s;tration des Finances de la France, par Mon&s;. Necker, vol. i. p. 288.</NOTE>. The Generality of Li&s;le (this I admit is the &s;tronge&s;t example) upon an extent of 404 &frac12; leagues, about ten years ago, contained 734,600 &s;ouls which is 1772 inhabitants to each &s;quare league. The middle term for the re&s;t of France is about 900 inhabitants to the &s;ame admea&s;urment.</P>
<P>I do not attribute this population to the depo&s;ed government; becau&s;e I do not like to compliment the contrivances of men, with what is due in a great degree to the bounty of Providence. But that decried government could not have ob&s;tructed, mo&s;t probably it favoured, the operation of tho&s;e cau&s;es (whatever they were) whether of nature in the &s;oil, or in habits of indu&s;try among the people, which has produced &s;o large a number of the &s;pecies throughout that whole kingdom, and exhibited in &s;ome particular places &s;uch prodigies of population. I never will &s;uppo&s;e that fabrick of a &s;tate to be the wor&s;t of all poli|tical in&s;titutions, which, by experience, is found to contain a principle favourable (however latent it may be) to the encrea&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>The wealth of a country is another, and no contemptible &s;tandand, by which we may judge whether, on the whole, a government be protecting or de&s;tructive. France far exceeds England in the multitude of her people; but I apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to ours; that it is not &s;o equal in the di&s;tribution, nor &s;o ready in the circulation. I believe the difference in the form of the two governments to be among&s;t the cau&s;es of this advantage on the &s;ide of England. I &s;peak of England, not of the whole Briti&s;h dominions; which, if compared with tho&s;e of France, will, in &s;ome degree, weaken the comparative rate of wealth upon our &s;ide. But that wealth, which will not endure a compari&s;on with the riches of England, may con&s;titute a very re&s;pectable degree of opulence. Mr. Necker's book publi&s;hed in 1785 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De l'Admini&s;tration des Finances de la France, par M. Necker.</NOTE>, contains an accurate and intere&s;ting collection of facts relative to public oeconomy and to political arithmetic; and his &s;peculations on the &s;ubject are general wi&s;e and liberal. In that work he gives an idea of the &s;tate of France, very remote from the portrait of a country

who&s;e government was a perfect grievance, an ab&s;olute evil, admitting no cure but through the violent and uncertain reme|dy of a total revolution. He affirms, that from the year 1726 to the year 1784, there was coined at the mint of France, in the &s;pecies of gold and &s;ilver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds &s;terling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii. chap. 8. and chap. 9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that Mr. Necker &s;hould be mi&s;taken in the amount of the bullion which has been coined in the mint. It is a matter of official record. The rea&s;onings of this able fi|nancier, concerning the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which re|mained for circulation, when he wrote in 1785, that is about four years before the depo&s;ition and impri&s;onment of the French King, are not of equal certainty; but they are laid on grounds &s;o apparently &s;olid, that it is not ea&s;y to refu&s;e a con&s;iderable degree of a&s;&s;ent to his calculation. He calculates the <HI>nume|raire,</HI> or what we call <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> then actually exi&s;ting in France, at about eighty-eight millions of the &s;ame Engli&s;h money. A great accumulation of wealth for one country, large as that country is! Mr. Necker was &s;o far from con&s;idering this influx of wealth as likely to cea&s;e, when he wrote in 1785, that he pre&s;umes upon a future annual increa&s;e of two per cent. upon the money brought into France during the periods from which he computed.</P>
<P>Some adequate cau&s;e mu&s;t have originally, introduced all the money coined at its mint into that kingdom; and &s;ome cau&s;e as operative mu&s;t have kept at home, or returned into its bo|&s;om, &s;uch a va&s;t flood of trea&s;ure as Mr. Necker calculates to remain for dome&s;tic circulation. Suppo&s;e any rea&s;onable de|ductions from M. Necker's computation; the remainder mu&s;t &s;till amount to an immen&s;e &s;um. Cau&s;es thus powerful to ac|quire and to retain, cannot be found in di&s;couraged indu&s;try, in&s;ecure property, and a po&s;itively de&s;tructive government. Indeed, when I con&s;ider the face of the kingdom of France; the multitude and opulence of her cities; the u&s;eful magnifi|cence of her &s;pacious high roads and bridges; the opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the convenien|ces of maritime communication through a &s;olid continent of &s;o immen&s;e an extent; when I turn my eyes to the &s;tupendous works of her ports and harbours, and to her whole naval appa|ratus, whether for war or trade; when I bring before my view the number of her fortifications, con&s;tructed with &s;o bold and ma&s;terly a &s;kill, and made and maintained at &s;o prodigious a charge, pre&s;enting an armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every &s;ide; when I recollect how very &s;mall a part of that exten&s;ive region is without cultivation, and
<PB N="106" REF="023238_0108_0FBED555F81963A0">
to what complete perfection the culture of many of the be&s;t pro|ductions of the earth have been brought in France; when I reflect on the excellence of her manufactures and fabrics, &s;e|cond to none but ours, and in &s;ome particulars not &s;econd; when I contemplate the grand foundations of charity, public and private; when I &s;urvey the &s;tate of all the arts that beau|tify and poli&s;h life; when I reckon the men &s;he has bred for extending her fame in war, her able &s;tate&s;men, the multitude of her profound lawyers and theologians, her philo&s;ophers, her critics, her hi&s;torians and antiquaries, her poets, and her orators &s;acred and profane, I behold in all this &s;omething which awes and commands the imagination, which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure, and which demands, that we &s;hould very &s;eriou&s;ly examine, what and how great are the latent vices that could authori&s;e us at once to level &s;o &s;pecious a fabric with the ground. I do not recognize, in this view of things, the de&s;poti&s;m of Turkey. Nor do I di&s;cern the character of a government that has been, on the whole, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive, or &s;o corrupt, or &s;o negligent, as to be utterly unfit <HI>for all reformation.</HI> I mu&s;t think &s;uch a go|vernment well de&s;erved to have its excellencies heightened; its faults corrected; and its capacities improved into a Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Whoever has examined into the proceedings of that depo&s;ed government for &s;everal years back, cannot fail to have ob&s;erved, amid&s;t the incon&s;tancy and fluctuation natural to courts, an earne&s;t endeavour towards the pro&s;perity and improvement of the country; he mu&s;t admit, that it had long been employed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, wholly to remove, in many con&s;iderably to correct, the abu&s;ive practices and u&s;ages that had prevailed in the &s;tate; and that even the unlimitted power of the &s;overeign over the per&s;ons of his &s;ubjects, incon&s;i&s;tent, as undoubtedly it was, with law and liberty, had yet been every day growing more mitigated in the exerci&s;e. So far from refu&s;ing it&s;elf to reformation, that government was open, with a cen&s;urable de|gree of facility, to all &s;orts of projects and projecters on the &s;ub|ject. Rather too much countenance was given to the &s;pirit of innovation, which &s;oon was turned again&s;t tho&s;e who fo&s;tered it, and ended in their ruin. It is but cold, and no very flattering ju&s;tice to that fallen monarchy, to &s;ay, that, for many years, it tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed more by levity and want of judgment in &s;everal of its &s;chemes, than from any defect in diligence or in public &s;pirit. To compare the government of France for the la&s;t fif|teen or &s;ixteen years with wi&s;e and well-con&s;tituted e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, during that, or during any period, is not to act with fairne&s;s. But if in point of prodigality in the expenditure of
<PB N="107" REF="023238_0109_0FBED558013A4908">
money, or in point of rigour in the exerci&s;e of power, it be compared with any of the former reigns, I believe candid judges will give little credit to the good intentions of tho&s;e who dwell perpetually on the donations to favourites, or on the expences of the court, or on the horrors of the Ba&s;tile in the reign of Louis the XVIth.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;y&s;tem, if it de&s;erves &s;uch a name, now built on the ruins of that antient monarchy, will be able to give a bet|ter account of the population and wealth of the country, which it has taken under its care, is a matter very doubtful. In&s;tead of improving by the change, I apprehend that a long &s;eries of years mu&s;t be told before it can recover in any degree the effects of this philo&s;ophic revolution, and before the nation can be replaced on its former footing. If Dr. Price &s;hould think fit, a few years hence, to favour us with an e&s;timate of the popu|lation of France, he will hardly be able to make up his tale of thirty millions of &s;ouls, as computed in 1789, or the a&s;&s;embly's computation of twenty-&s;ix millions of that year; or even Mr. Necker's twenty-five millions in 1780. I hear that there are con&s;iderable emigrations from France; and that many quitting that voluptuous climate, and that &s;eductive <HI>Circean</HI> liberty, have taken refuge in the frozen regions, and under the Briti&s;h de&s;poti&s;m, of Canada.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent di&s;appearance of coin, no per&s;on could think it the &s;ame country, in which the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter of the finances has been able to di&s;cover four&s;core millions &s;terling in &s;pecie. From its general a&s;pect one would conclude that it had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t under the &s;pecial direction of the learned acade|micians of Laputa and Balnibarbi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gulliver's Travels for the idea of countries governed by philo|&s;ophers.</NOTE>. Already the population of Paris has &s;o declined, that Mr. Necker &s;tated to the national a&s;&s;embly the provi&s;ion to be made for its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at a fifth le&s;s than what had formerly been found requi&s;ite. It is &s;aid (and I have never heard it contradicted) that an hundred thou|&s;and people are out of employment in that city, though it is become the &s;eat of the impri&s;oned court and national a&s;&s;embly. Nothing, I am credibly informed, can exceed the &s;hocking and di&s;gu&s;ting &s;pectacle of mendicancy di&s;played in that capital. Indeed, the votes of the national a&s;&s;embly leave no doubt of the fact. They have lately appointed a &s;tanding committee of mendicancy. They are contriving at once a vigorous police on this &s;ubject, and, for the fir&s;t time, the impo&s;ition of a tax to maintain the poor, for who&s;e pre&s;ent relief great &s;ums appear

</TABLE></P></NOTE>. In the mean time, the leaders of the legi&s;lative clubs and coffee-hou&s;es are intoxicated with admiration at their own wi&s;dom and ability. They &s;peak with the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt of the re&s;t of the world. They tell the people, to comfort them in the rags with which they have cloathed them, that they are a nation of philo&s;ophers; and, &s;ometimes, by all the arts of quacki&s;h parade, by &s;hew, tumult, and bu&s;tle, &s;ometimes by the alarms of plots and inva&s;ions, they attempt to drown the cries of indigence, and to divert the eyes of the ob&s;erver from the ruin and wretchedne&s;s of the &s;tate. A brave people will certainly prefer liberty, accompanied with a virtuous poverty, to a de|praved and wealthy &s;ervi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le. But before the price of comfort and opulence is paid, one ought to be pretty &s;ure, it is real liberty which is purcha&s;ed, and that &s;he is to be purcha&s;ed at no other price. I &s;hall always, however, con&s;ider that liberty as very equivocal in her appearance, which has not wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice for her companions; and does not lead pro&s;perity and plenty in her train.</P>
<P>The advocates for this revolution, not &s;atisfied with exagge|rating the vices of their antient government, &s;trike at the fame of their country it&s;elf, by painting almo&s;t all that could have attracted the attention of &s;trangers, I mean their nobility and their clergy, as objects of horror. If this were only a libel, there had not been much in it. But it has practical con&s;e|quences. Had your nobility and gentry, who formed the great body of your landed men, and the whole of your military of|ficers, re&s;embled tho&s;e of Germany. at the period when the Han&s;e-towns were nece&s;&s;itated to confederate again&s;t the nobles
<PB N="109" REF="023238_0111_0FBED55C9072C508">
in defence of their property&mdash;had they been like the <HI>Or&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Vitelli</HI> in Italy, who u&s;ed to &s;ally from their fortified dens to rob the trader and traveller&mdash;had they been &s;uch as the <HI>Mama|lukes</HI> in Egypt, or the <HI>Nayres</HI> on the coa&s;t of Malabar, I do ad|mit, that too critical an enquiry might not be advi&s;eable into the means of freeing the world from &s;uch a nui&s;ance. The &s;ta|tues of Equity and Mercy might be veiled for a moment. The tendere&s;t minds, confounded with the dreadful exigence in which morality &s;ubmits to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of its own rules in favour of its own principles, might turn a&s;ide whil&s;t fraud and violence were accompli&s;hing the de&s;truction of a pretended nobility which di&s;graced whil&s;t it per&s;ecuted human nature. The per|&s;ons mo&s;t abhorrent from blood, and trea&s;on, and arbitrary confi&s;cation, might remain &s;ilent &s;pectators of this civil war between the vices.</P>
<P>But did the privileged nobility who met under the king's pre|cept at Ver&s;ailles, in 1789, or their con&s;tituents, de&s;erves to be looked on as the <HI>Nayres</HI> or <HI>Mamalukes</HI> of this age, or as the <HI>Or|&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Vitelli</HI> of antient times? If I had then a&s;ked the que&s;ti|on, I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed for a madman. What have they &s;ince done that they were to be driven into exile, that their per&s;ons &s;hould be hunted about, mangled, and tortured, their families di&s;per&s;ed, their hou&s;es laid in a&s;hes, that their order &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and the memory of it, if po&s;&s;ible, extingui&s;hed, by ordaining them to change the very names by which they were u&s;ually known? Read their in&s;tructions to their repre&s;entatives. They breathe the &s;pirit of liberty as warmly, and they recom|mend reformation as &s;trongly, as any other order. Their pri|vileges relative to contribution were voluntarily &s;urrendered; as the king, from the beginning, &s;urrendered all pretence to a right of taxation. Upon a free con&s;titution there was but one opinion in France. The ab&s;olute monarchy was at an end. It breathed its la&s;t, without a groan, without &s;truggle, without convul&s;ion. All the &s;truggle, all the di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e after|wards upon the preference of a de&s;potic democracy to a govern|ment of reciprocal controul. The triumph of the victorious party was over the principles of a Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved the affectation, which, for many years pa&s;t, has prevailed in Paris even to a degree perfectly childi&s;h, of idolizing the memory of your Henry the Fourth. If any thing could put one out of humour with that ornament to the kingly character, it would be this overdone &s;tyle of infidious panegy|ric. The per&s;ons who have worked this engine the mo&s;t bu&s;ily, are tho&s;e who have ended their panegyrics in dethroning his &s;ucce&s;&s;or and de&s;cendant; a man, as good-natured at the lea&s;t, as Henry the Fourth; altogether as fond of his people; and
<PB N="110" REF="023238_0112_0FBED561BAD11160">
who has done infinitely more to correct the antient vices of the &s;tate than that great monarch did, or we are &s;ure he ever meant to do. Well it is for his panegyri&s;ts that they have not him to deal with. For Henry of Navarre was a re&s;olute, active, and politic prince. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indeed great humanity and mild|ne&s;s; but an humanity and mildne&s;s that never &s;tood in the way of his intere&s;ts. He never &s;ought to be loved without put|ting him&s;elf fir&s;t in a condition to be feared. He u&s;ed &s;oft language with determined conduct. He a&s;&s;erted and main|tained his authority in the gro&s;s, and di&s;tributed his acts of con|ce&s;&s;ion only in the detail. He &s;pent the income of his preroga|tives nobly; but he took care not to break in upon the capital; never abandoning for a moment any of the claims, which he made under the fundamental laws, nor &s;paring to &s;hed the blood of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him, often in the field, &s;ometimes upon the &s;caffold. Becau&s;e he knew how to make his virtues re&s;pect|ed by the ungrateful, he has merited the prai&s;es of tho&s;e whom, if they had lived in his time, he would have &s;hut up in the Ba&s;|tile, and brought to puni&s;hment along with the regicides whom he hanged after he had fami&s;hed Paris into a &s;urrender.</P>
<P>If the&s;e panegyri&s;ts are in earne&s;t in their admiration of Henry the fourth, they mu&s;t remember, that they cannot think more highly of him, than he did of the noble&s;&s;e of France; who&s;e virtue, honour, courage, patrioti&s;m, and royalty were his con&s;tant theme.</P>
<P>But the nobility of France are degenerated &s;ince the days of Henry the Fourth.&mdash;This is po&s;&s;ible. But it is more than I can believe to be true in any great degree. I do not pretend to know France as correctly as &s;ome others; but I have endea|voured through my whole life to make my&s;elf acquainted with human nature; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be unfit to take even my humble part in the &s;ervice of mankind. In that &s;tudy I could not pa&s;s by a va&s;t portion of our nature, as it appeared modified in a country but twenty-four miles from the &s;hore of this i&s;land. On my be&s;t ob&s;ervation, compared with my be&s;t enquiries, I found your nobility for the greater part compo&s;ed of men of an high &s;pirit, and of a delicate &s;en&s;e of honour, both with regard to them&s;elves individually, and with regard to their whole corps, over whom they kept, beyond what is common in other countries, a cen&s;orial eye. They were tolerably well|bred; very officious, humane, and ho&s;pitable; in their con|ver&s;ation frank and open; with a good military tone; and rea&s;onably tinctured with literature, particularly of the authors in their own language. Many had preten&s;ions far above this de&s;cription. I &s;peak of tho&s;e who were generally met with.</P>
<P>As to their behaviour to the inferior cla&s;&s;es, they appeared
<PB N="111" REF="023238_0113_0FBED562A5621950">
to me to comport them&s;elves towards them with good-nature, and with &s;omething more nearly opproaching to familiarity, than is generally practi&s;ed with us in the intercour&s;e between the higher and lower ranks of life. To &s;trike any per&s;on, even in the mo&s;t abject condition, was a thing in a manner unknown, and would be highly di&s;graceful. In&s;tances of other ill-treatment of the humble part of the community were rare; and as to attacks made upon the property or the per&s;onal liberty of the commons, I never heard of any what&s;oever from <HI>them;</HI> nor, whil&s;t the laws were in vigour under the antient govern|ment, would &s;uch tyranny in &s;ubjects have been permitted. As men of landed e&s;tates, I had no fault to find with their conduct, though much to reprehend, and much to wi&s;h chang|ed, in many of the old tenures. Where the letting of their land was by rent, I could not di&s;cover that their agreements with their farmers were oppre&s;&s;ive; nor when they were in partner&s;hip with the farmer, as often was the ca&s;e, have I heard that they had taken the lion's &s;hare. The proportions &s;eemed not inequitable. There might be exceptions; but certainly they were exceptions only. I have no rea&s;on to be|lieve that in the&s;e re&s;pects the landed noble&s;&s;e of France were wor&s;e than the landed gentry of this country; certainly in no re&s;pect more vexatious than the land-holders, not noble, of their own nation. In cities the nobility had no manner of power; in the country very little. You know, Sir, that much of the civil government, and the police in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts, was not in the hands of that nobility which pre&s;ents it|&s;elf fir&s;t to our con&s;ideration. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enue, the &s;y&s;tem and collection of which were the mo&s;t grievous parts of the French government, was not admini&s;tered by the men of the &s;word; nor were they an&s;werable for the vices of its principle, or the vexations, where any &s;uch exi&s;ted, in its management.</P>
<P>Denying, as I am well warranted to do, that the nobility had any con&s;iderable &s;hare in the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, in ca&s;es in which real oppre&s;&s;ion exi&s;ted, I am ready to admit that they were not without con&s;iderable faults and errors. A fooli&s;h imitation of the wor&s;t part of the manners of England, which impaired their natural character without &s;ub&s;tituting in its place what perhaps they meant, has certainly rendered them wor&s;e than formerly they were. Habitual di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners continued beyond the pardonable period of life, was more common among&s;t them than it is with us; and it reigned with the le&s;s hope of remedy, though po&s;&s;ibly with &s;omething of le&s;s mi&s;chief, by being covered with more exterior decorum. They countenanced too much that licentious philo&s;ophy which has helped to bring on their ruin. There was another error
<PB N="112" REF="023238_0114_0FBED564EFF89BF0">
among&s;t them more fatal. Tho&s;e of the commons, who ap|proached to or exceeded many of the nobility in point of wealth, were not fully admitted to the rank and e&s;timation which wealth, in rea&s;on and good policy, ought to be&s;tow in every country; though I think not equally with that of other nobility. The two kinds of ari&s;tocracy were too punctiliou&s;ly kept a&s;under; le&s;s &s;o, however, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in Germany and &s;ome other nations.</P>
<P>This &s;eparation, as I have already taken the liberty of &s;ug|ge&s;ting to you, I conceive to be one principal cau&s;e of the de|&s;truction of the old nobility. The military, particularly, was too exclu&s;ively re&s;erved for men of family. But after all, this was an error of opinion, which a conflicting opinion would have rectified. A permanent a&s;&s;embly, in which the commons had their &s;hare of power, would &s;oon aboli&s;h whatever was too invidious and in&s;ulting in the&s;e di&s;tinctions: and even the faults in the morals of the nobility would have been probably cor|rected by the greater varieties of occupation and pur&s;uit to which a con&s;titution by orders would have given ri&s;e.</P>
<P>All this violent cry again&s;t the nobility I take to be a mere work of art. To be honoured and even privileged by the laws, opinions, and inveterate u&s;ages of our country, growing out of the prejudice of ages, has nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man. Even to be too tenacious of tho&s;e privileges, is not ab&s;olutely a crime. The &s;trong &s;trug|gle in every individual to pre&s;erve po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he has &s;ound to belong to him and to di&s;tingui&s;h him, is one of the &s;ecurities again&s;t inju&s;tice and de&s;poti&s;m implanted in our na|ture. It operates as an in&s;tinct to &s;ecure property, and to pre&s;erve communities in a &s;ettled &s;tate. What is there to &s;hock in this? Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order. It is the Corinthian capital of poli&s;hed &s;ociety. <HI>Omnes boni nobilitati &s;emper favemus,</HI> was the &s;aying of a wi&s;e and good man. It is indeed one &s;ign of a liberal and benevolent mind to incline to it with &s;ome &s;ort of partial propen&s;ity. He feels no ennobling principle in his own heart who wi&s;hes to level all the artificial in&s;titutions which have been adopted for giving a body to opinion and permanence to fugitive e&s;teem. It is a &s;our, malignant, envious di&s;po&s;ition, without ta&s;te for the reality or for any image or repre&s;entation of virtue, that &s;ees with joy the unmerited fall of what had long flouri&s;hed in &s;plendour and in honour. I do not like to &s;ee any thing de&s;troy|ed; any void produced in &s;ociety; any ruin on the face of the land. It was therefore with no di&s;appointment or di&s;&s;atisfaction a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my enquiries and ob&s;ervation did not pre&s;ent to me any incor|rigible vices in the noble&s;&s;e of France, or any abu&s;e which could

not be removed by a reform very &s;hort of abolition. Your noble&s;&s;e did not de&s;erve puni&s;hment; but to degrade is to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>It was with the &s;ame &s;atisfaction I found that the re&s;ult of my enquiry concerning your clergy was not di&s;&s;imilar. It is no &s;oothing news to my ears, that great bodies of men are incurably corrupt. It is not with much credulity I li&s;ten to any, when they &s;peak evil of tho&s;e whom they are going to plunder. I rather &s;u&s;pect that vices are feigned or exaggerated, when profit is looked for in their puni&s;hment. An enemy is a bad witne&s;s; a robber is a wor&s;e. Vices and abu&s;es there were undoubtedly in that order, and mu&s;t be. It was an old e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and not frequently revi&s;ed. But I &s;aw no crimes in the individuals that merited confi&s;cation of their &s;ub&s;tance, nor tho&s;e cruel in&s;ults and degradations, and that unnatural per&s;ecution which have been &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of melio|rating regulation.</P>
<P>If there had been any ju&s;t cau&s;e for this new religious per|&s;ecution, the athei&s;tic libellers, who act as trumpeters to animate the populace to plunder, do not love any body &s;o much as not to dwell with complacence on the vices of the exi&s;ting clergy. This they have not done. They find them&s;elves obliged to ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e into the hi&s;tories of former ages (which they have ran&s;acked with a malignant and profligate indu&s;try) for every in&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution which has been made by that body or in its favour, in order to ju&s;tify, upon very iniquitous, becau&s;e very illogical principles of retali|ation, their own per&s;ecutions, and their own cruelties. After de&s;troying all other genealogies and family di&s;tinctions, they invent a &s;ort of pedigree of crimes. It is not very ju&s;t to cha&s;ti&s;e men for the offences of their natural ance&s;tors; but to take the fiction of ance&s;try in a corporate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as a ground for puni&s;hing men who have no relation to guilty acts, except in names and general de&s;criptions, is a &s;ort of refinement in inju&s;tice belonging to the philo&s;ophy of this enlightened age. The a&s;&s;embly puni&s;hes men, many, if not mo&s;t, of whom abhor the violent conduct of eccle&s;ia&s;tics in former times as much as their pre&s;ent per&s;ecutors can do, and who would be as loud and as &s;trong in the expre&s;&s;ion of that &s;en&s;e, if they were not well aware of the purpo&s;es for which all this declamation is employed.</P>
<P>Corporate bodies are immortal for the good of the members, but not for their puni&s;hment. Nations them&s;elves are &s;uch corporations. As well might we in England think of waging inexpiable war upon all Frenchmen for the evils which they have brought upon us in the &s;everal periods of our mutual ho&s;ti|lities.

You might, on your part, think your&s;elves ju&s;tified in falling upon all Engli&s;hmen on account of the unparalleled calamities brought upon the people of France by the unju&s;t inva&s;ions of our Henries and our Edwards. Indeed we &s;hould be mutually ju&s;tified in this exterminatory war upon each other, full as much as you are in the unprovoked per&s;ecution of your pre&s;ent countrymen, on account of the conduct of men of the &s;ame name in other times.</P>
<P>We do not draw the moral le&s;&s;ons we might from hi&s;tory. On the contrary, without care it may be u&s;ed to vitiate our minds and to de&s;troy our happine&s;s.

The&s;e vices are the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of tho&s;e &s;torms.

If you did, you would root out every thing that is valuable in the human brea&s;t. As the&s;e are the pretexts, &s;o the ordinary actors and in&s;truments in great public evils are kings, prie&s;ts, migi&s;trates, &s;enates, par|liaments, national a&s;&s;emblies, judges, and captains.

<P>Your citizens of Paris formerly had lent them&s;elves as the ready in&s;truments to &s;laughter, the followers of Calvin, at the infamous ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew. What &s;hould we &s;ay to tho&s;e who could think of retaliating on the Pari&s;ians of this day, the abomi|nations and horrors of that time? They are indeed brought to abhor <HI>that</HI> ma&s;&s;acre. Ferocious as they are, it is not difficult to make them di&s;like it; becau&s;e the politicians and fa&s;hionable teachers have no intere&s;t in giving their pa&s;&s;ions exactly the &s;ame direction. Still however they find it their intere&s;t to keep the &s;ame &s;avage di&s;po&s;itions alive. It was but the other day that they cau&s;ed this very ma&s;&s;acre to be acted on the &s;tage for the diver&s;ion of the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who committed it. In this tragic farce they produced the cardinal of Lorraine in his robes of function, order|ing general &s;laughter. Was this &s;pectacle intended to make the Pari&s;ians abhor per&s;ecution, and loath the effu&s;ion of blood?&mdash;No, it was to teach them to per&s;ecute their own pa&s;tors; it was to ex|cite them, by rai&s;ing a di&s;gu&s;t and horror of their clergy, to an alacrity in hunting down to de&s;truction an order, which, if it ought to exi&s;t at all, ought to exi&s;t not only in &s;afety, but in reve|rence. It was to &s;timulate their cannibal appetites (which one would think had been gorged &s;ufficiently) by variety and &s;ea&s;on|ing; and to quicken them to an alertne&s;s in new murders and ma&s;&s;acres, if it &s;hould &s;uit the purpo&s;e of the Gui&s;es of the day. An a&s;&s;embly, in which &s;at a multitude of prie&s;ts and prelates, was obliged to &s;uffer this indignity at its door. The author was not &s;ent to the gallies, nor the players to the hou&s;e of correction.

It will teach future prie&s;ts and magi&s;trates not to retaliate upon the &s;peculative and inactive athei&s;ts of future times, the enormities committed by the pre&s;ent practical zealots and furious fanatics of that wretched error which, in its quie&s;cent &s;tate, is more than pu|ni&s;hed whenever it is embraced. It will teach po&s;terity not to make war upon either religion or philo&s;ophy, for the abu&s;e which the hypocrites of both have made of the two mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ings conferred upon us by the bounty of the univer&s;al Patron, who in all things eminently favours and protects the race of man.</P>
<P>If your clergy, or any clergy, &s;hould &s;hew them&s;elves vicious beyond the fair bounds allowed to human infirmity, and to tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ional faults which can hardly be &s;eparated from profe&s;&s;ional virtues, though their vices never can countenance the exerci&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, I do admit, that they would naturally have the effect of abating very much of our indignation again&s;t the tyrants who exceed mea&s;ure and ju&s;tice in their puni&s;hment. I can allow in clergymen, through all their divi&s;ions, &s;ome tenaciou&s;ne&s;s of their own opinion; &s;ome overflowings of zeal for its propagation; &s;ome predilection to their own &s;tate and office; &s;ome attachment to the intere&s;t of their own corps; &s;ome preference to tho&s;e who li&s;ten with docility to their doctrines, beyond tho&s;e who &s;corn and deride them. I allow all this, becau&s;e I am a man who have to deal with men, and who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the greate&s;t of all intolerance. I mu&s;t bear with infirmities until they fe&s;ter into crimes.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, the natural progre&s;s of the pa&s;&s;ions, from frailty to vice, ought to be prevented by a watchful eye and a firm hand. But is it true that the body of your clergy had pa&s;t tho&s;e limits of a ju&s;t allowance? From the general &s;tyle of your late publications of all &s;orts, one would be led to believe that your clergy in France were a &s;ort of mon&s;ters; an horrible compo&s;ition of &s;uper&s;tition, ignorance, &s;loth, fraud, avarice, and tyranny. But is this true? Is it true, that the lap&s;e of time, the ce&s;&s;ation of conflicting inte|re&s;ts,

the woful experience of the evils re&s;ulting from party rage, has had no &s;ort of influence gradually to meliorate their minds? Is it true, that they were daily renewing inva&s;ions on the civil power, troubling the dome&s;tic quiet of their country, and render|ing the operations of its government feeble and precarious? Is it true, that the clergy of our times have pre&s;&s;ed down the laity with an iron hand, and were, in all places, lighting up the fires of a &s;avage per&s;ecution? Did they by every fraud endeavour to increa&s;e their e&s;tates? Did they u&s;e to exceed the due demands on e&s;tates that were their own? Or, rigidly &s;crewing up right into wrong, did they convert a legal claim into a vexatious extortion? When not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, were they filled with the vices of tho&s;e who envy it? Were they inflamed with a violent litigious &s;pirit of controver&s;y? Goaded on with the ambition of intellectual &s;overeignty, were they ready to fly in the face of all magi&s;tracy, to fire churches, to ma&s;&s;acre the prie&s;ts of other de&s;criptions, to pull down altars, and to make their way over the ruins of &s;ub|verted governments to an empire of doctrine, &s;ometimes flattering, &s;ometimes forcing the con&s;ciences of men from the juri&s;diction of public in&s;titutions into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their per&s;onal authority, beginning with a claim of liberty and ending with an abu&s;e of power?</P>
<P>The&s;e, or &s;ome of the&s;e, were the vices objected, and not wholly without foundation, to &s;everal of the churchmen of former times, who belonged to the two great parties which then divided and di&s;|tracted Europe.</P>
<P>If there was in France, as in other countries there vi&s;ibly is, a great abatement, rather than any increa&s;e of the&s;e vices, in&s;tead of load|ing the pre&s;ent clergy with the crimes of other men, and the odi|ous character of other times, in common equity they ought to be prai&s;ed, encouraged, and &s;upported, in their departure from a &s;pirit which di&s;graced their predece&s;&s;ors, and for having a&s;&s;umed a tem|per of mind and manners more &s;uitable to their &s;acred function.</P>
<P>When my occa&s;ions took me into France, towards the clo&s;e of the late reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a con&s;i|derable part of my curio&s;ity. So far from finding (except from one &s;et of men, not then very numerous though very active) the complaints and di&s;contents again&s;t that body, which &s;ome publica|tions had given me rea&s;on to expect, I perceived little or no public or private unea&s;ine&s;s on their account. On further examination, I found the clergy in general, per&s;ons of moderate minds and de|corous manners; I include the &s;eculars, and the regulars of both &s;exes. I had not the good fortune to know a great many of the parochial clergy; but in general I received a perfectly good account of their morals, and of their attention to their duties. With &s;ome of the higher clergy I had a per&s;onal acquaintance; and of the re&s;t

in that cla&s;s, very good means of information. They were, almo&s;t all of them, per&s;ons of noble birth. They re&s;embled others of their own rank; and where there was any difference, it was in their favour. They were more fully educated than the military noble&s;&s;e; &s;o as by no means to di&s;grace their profe&s;&s;ion by ignorance, or by want of fitne&s;s for the exerci&s;e of their authority. They &s;eemed to me, beyond the clerical character, liberal and open; with the hearts of gentlemen, and men of honour; neither in&s;o|lent nor &s;ervile in their manners and conduct. They &s;eemed to me rather a &s;uperior cla&s;s; a &s;et of men, among&s;t whom you would not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find a <HI>Fenelon.</HI> I &s;aw among the clergy in Paris, (many of the de&s;cription are not to be met with any where) men of great learning and candour; and I had rea&s;on to believe, that this de&s;cription was not confined to Paris. What I found in other places, I know was accidental; and therefore to be pre&s;umed a fair &s;ample. I &s;pent a few days in a provincial town, where, in the ab&s;ence of the bi&s;hop, I pa&s;&s;ed my evenings with three clergymen, his vicars general, per&s;ons who would have done honour to any church. They were all well informed; two of them of deep, ge|neral, and exten&s;ive erudition, antient and modern, oriental and we&s;tern; particularly in their own profe&s;&s;ion. They had a more exten&s;ive knowledge of our Engli&s;h divines than I expected; and they entered into the genius of tho&s;e writers with a critical accu|racy. One of the&s;e gentlemen is &s;ince dead, the Abb&eacute; <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rangis.</HI> I pay this tribute, without reluctance, to the memory of that no|ble, reverend, learned, and excellent per&s;on; and I &s;hould do the &s;ame, with equal cheerfulne&s;s, to the merits of the others, who, I believe, are &s;till living, if I did not fear to hurt tho&s;e whom I am unable to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics of rank, are by all titles, per&s;ons de|&s;erving of general re&s;pect. They are de&s;erving of gratitude from me, and from many Engli&s;h. If this letter &s;hould ever come into their hands, I hope they will believe there are tho&s;e of our nation who feel for their unmerited fall, and for the cruel confi&s;cation of their fortunes, with no common &s;en&s;ibility. What I &s;ay of them is a te&s;timony, as far as one feeble voice can go, which I owe to truth. Whenever the que&s;tion of this unnatural per&s;ecution is con|cerned, I will pay it. No one &s;hall prevent me from being ju&s;t and grateful. The time is fitted for the duty; and it is particularly becoming to &s;hew our ju&s;tice and gratitude, when tho&s;e who have de&s;erved well of us and of mankind are labouring under popular obloquy and the per&s;ecutions of oppre&s;&s;ive power.</P>
<P>You had before your revolution about an hundred and twenty bi&s;hops. A few of them were men of eminent &s;anctity, and cha|rity without limit. When we talk of the heroic, of cour&s;e we talk of rare virtue. I believe the in&s;tances of eminent depravity
<PB N="119" REF="023238_0121_0FBED574BA7F3070">
may be as rare among&s;t them as tho&s;e of tran&s;cendent goodne&s;s. Examples of avarice and of licentiou&s;ne&s;s may be picked out, I do not que&s;tion it, by tho&s;e who delight in the inve&s;tigation which leads to &s;uch di&s;coveries. A man, as old as I am, will not be a&s;|toni&s;hed that &s;everal, in every de&s;cription, do not lead that perfect life of &s;elf-denial, with regard to wealth or to plea&s;ure, which is wi&s;hed for by all, by &s;ome expected, but by none exacted with more rigour, than by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t attentive to their own intere&s;ts, or the mo&s;t indulgent of their own pa&s;|&s;ions. When I was in France, I am certain that the number of vicious prelates was not great. Certain individuals among them, not di&s;tingui&s;hable for the regularity of their lives, made &s;ome amends for their want of the &s;evere virtues, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the liberal; and were endowed with qualities which made them u&s;eful in the church and &s;tate. I am told, that with few exceptions, Louis the Sixteenth had been more attentive to character, in his promotions to that rank, than his immediate predece&s;&s;or; and I believe, (as &s;ome &s;pirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign) that it may be true. But the pre&s;ent ruling power has &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition only to plunder the church. It has puni&s;hed <HI>all</HI> pre|lates; which is to favour the vicious, at lea&s;t in point of reputation. It has made a degrading pen&s;ionary e&s;tabli&s;hment, to which no man of liberal ideas or liberal condition will de&s;tine his children. It mu&s;t &s;ettle into the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the people. As with you the inferior clergy are not numerous enough for their duties; as the&s;e duties are, beyond mea&s;ure, minute and toil&s;ome; as you have left no middle cla&s;&s;es of clergy at their ea&s;e, in future nothing of &s;cience or erudition can exi&s;t in the Gallican church. To complete the project, without the lea&s;t attention to the rights of patrons, the a&s;&s;embly has provided in future an elective clergy; an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical profe&s;&s;ion all men of &s;obriety; all who can pretend to independence in their function or their con|duct; and which will throw the whole direction of the public mind into the hands of a &s;et of licentious, bold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of &s;uch condition and &s;uch habits of life as will make their contemptible pen&s;ions (in compari&s;on of which the &s;tipend of an exci&s;eman is lucrative and honourable) an object of low and illiberal intrigue.

<P>I hope their partizans in England, (to whom I rather attribute very incon&s;iderate conduct than the ultimate object in this dete&s;table de&s;ign) will &s;ucceed neither in the pillage of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, nor in the introduction of a principle of popular election to our bi&s;hopricks and parochial cures. This, in the pre&s;ent condition of the world, would be the la&s;t corruption of the church; the utter ruin of the clerical character; the mo&s;t dangerous &s;hock that the &s;tate ever re|ceived through a mi&s;under&s;tood arrangement of religion. I know well enough that the bi&s;hopricks and cures, under kingly and &s;eig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> noral patronage, as now they are in England, and as they have been lately in France, are &s;ometimes acquired by unworthy me|thods; but the other mode of eccle&s;ia&s;tical canvas &s;ubjects them in|finitely more &s;urely and more generally to all the evil arts of low ambition, which, operating on and through greater numbers, will produce mi&s;chief in proportion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of you who have robbed the clergy, think that they &s;hall ea&s;ily reconcile their conduct to all prote&s;tant nations; becau&s;e the clergy, whom they have thus plundered, degraded, and given over to mockery and &s;corn, are of the Roman Catholic, that is, of <HI>their own</HI> pretended per&s;ua&s;ion. I have no doubt that &s;ome mi&s;erable bigots will be found here as well as el&s;ewhere, who hate &s;ects and parties different from their own, more than they love the &s;ub&s;tance of religion; and who are more angry with tho&s;e who differ from them in their particular plans and &s;y&s;tems, than di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e who attack the foundation of our common hope.

will write and &s;peak on the &s;ubject in the manner that is to be ex|pected from their temper and character. Burnet &s;ays, that when he was in France, in the year 1683, <Q>the method which carried over the men of the fine&s;t parts to popery was this&mdash;they brought them&s;elves to doubt of the whole Chri&s;tian religion. When that was once done, it &s;eemed a more indifferent thing of what &s;ide or form they continued outwardly.</Q> If this was then the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic policy of France, it is what they have &s;ince but too much rea&s;on to repent of. They preferred athei&s;m to a form of religion not agreeable to their ideas. They &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying that form; and athei&s;m has &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying them. I can rea|dily give credit to Burnet's &s;tory, becau&s;e I have ob&s;erved too much of a &s;imilar &s;pirit (for a little of it is "much too much") among&s;t our&s;elves. The humour, however, is not general.</P>
<P>The teachers who reformed our religion in England, bore no &s;ort of re&s;emblance to your pre&s;ent reforming doctors in Paris. Perhaps they were (like tho&s;e whom they oppo&s;ed) rather more than could be wi&s;hed under the influence of a party &s;pirit; but they were mo&s;t &s;incere believers; men of the mo&s;t fervent and exalted piety; ready to die (as &s;ome of them did die) like true heroes in defence of their particular ideas of Chri&s;tianity; as they would with equal fortitude, and more cheerfully, for that &s;tock of general truth, for the branches of which they contended with their blood. The&s;e men would have di&s;avowed with horror tho&s;e wretches who claimed a fellow&s;hip with them upon no other titles than tho&s;e of their having pillaged the per&s;ons with whom they maintained controver&s;ies, and their having de&s;pi&s;ed the common religion, for the purity of which they exerted them&s;elves with a zeal, which unequivocally be&s;poke their highe&s;t reverence for the &s;ub&s;tance of that &s;y&s;tem which they wi&s;hed to reform. Many of their de&s;cendants have retained the &s;ame zeal; but (as le&s;s engaged in conflict) with more moderation. They do not forget, that ju&s;tice and mercy are &s;ub&s;tantial parts of religion. Impious men do not recommend them&s;elves to their communion by iniquity and cruelty towards any de&s;cription of their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>We hear the&s;e new teachers continually boa&s;ting of their &s;pirit of toleration. That tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould tolerate all opinions, who think none to be of e&s;timation, is a matter of &s;mall merit. Equal neglect is not impartial kindne&s;s. The &s;pecies of benevo|lence which ari&s;es from contempt, is no true charity. There are in England, abundance of men who tolerate in the true &s;pirit of toleration. They think the dogmas of religion, though in diffe|rent degrees, are all of moment; and that among&s;t them there is, as among&s;t all things of value, a ju&s;t ground of preference. They favour, therefore, and they tolerate. They tolerate, not becau&s;e they de&s;pi&s;e opinions, but becau&s;e they re&s;pect ju&s;tice. They

would reverently and affectionately protect all religions, becau&s;e they love and venerate the great principle upon which they all agree, and the great object to which they are all directed. They begin more and more plainly to di&s;cern, that we have all a com|mon cau&s;e, as again&s;t a common enemy. They will not be &s;o mi&s;led by the &s;pirit of faction, as not to di&s;tingui&s;h what is done in favour of their &s;ubdivi&s;ion, from tho&s;e acts of ho&s;tility which, through &s;ome particular de&s;cription, are aimed at the whole corps, in which they them&s;elves, under another denomination, are in|cluded. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay what may be the character of every de&s;cription of men among&s;t us. But I &s;peak for the greater part; and for them, I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;acrilege is no part of their doctrine of good works; that, &s;o far from calling you into their fellow&s;hip on &s;uch title, if your profe&s;&s;ors are admitted to their communion, they mu&s;t carefully conceal their doctrine of the lawfulne&s;s of the pro&s;cription of innocent men; and that they mu&s;t make re&s;titution of all &s;tolen goods what&s;oever. Till then they are none of ours.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e that we do not approve your confi&s;cation of the revenues of bi&s;hops, and deans, and chapters, and parochial clergy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing independent e&s;tates ari&s;ing from land, becau&s;e we have the &s;ame &s;ort of e&s;tabli&s;hment in England. That objection, you will &s;ay, cannot hold as to the confi&s;cation of the goods of monks and nuns, and the abolition of their order. It is true, that this particular part of your general confi&s;cation does not affect England, as a precedent in point: but the rea&s;on applies; and it goes a great way. The long parliament confi&s;cated the lands of deans and chapters in England on the &s;ame ideas upon which your a&s;&s;embly &s;et to &s;ale the lands of the mona&s;tic orders. But it is in the principle of inju&s;tice that the danger lies, and not in the de|&s;cription of per&s;ons on whom it is fir&s;t exerci&s;ed. I &s;ee, in a country very near us, a cour&s;e of policy pur&s;ued, which &s;ets ju&s;|tice, the common concern of mankind, at defiance. With the national a&s;&s;embly of France, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is nothing; law and u&s;age are nothing. I &s;ee the national a&s;&s;embly openly reprobate the doctrine of pre&s;cription, which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Domat.</NOTE>one of the greate&s;t of their own lawyers tells us, with great truth, is a part of the law of nature.

Flu&s;hed with the in&s;olence of their fir&s;t inglorious victories, and pre&s;&s;ed by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es cau&s;ed by their lu&s;t of unhallowed lucre, di&s;ap|pointed, but not di&s;couraged, they have at length ventured com|pletely to &s;ubvert all property of all de&s;criptions throughout the extent of a great kingdom. They have compelled all men, in all tran&s;actions of commerce, in the di&s;po&s;al of lands, in civil dealing, and through the whole communion of life, to accept, as perfect payment and good and lawful tender, the &s;ymbols of their &s;pecu|lations on a projected &s;ale of their plunder. What ve&s;tiges of liberty or property have they left? The tenant right of a cab|bage-garden, a year's intere&s;t in a hovel, the good-will of an ale-hou&s;e, or a baker's &s;hop, the very &s;hadow of a con&s;tructive pro|perty, are more ceremoniou&s;ly treated in our parliament, than with you the olde&s;t and mo&s;t valuable landed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the hands of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;onages, or than the whole body of the monied and commercial intere&s;t of your country. We entertain an high opinion of the legi&s;lative authority; but we have never dreamt that parliaments had any right whatever to violate property, to over-rule pre&s;cription, or to force a currency of their own fiction in the place of that which is real, and recognized by the law of nations. But you, who began with refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t moderate re&s;traints, have ended by e&s;tabli&s;hing an unheard-of de&s;|poti&s;m.

There were revenues with a public direction; there were men wholly &s;et apart and dedicated to public purpo&s;es, without any other than public ties and public principles; men without the po&s;&s;ibility of con|verting the e&s;tate of the community into a private fortune; men denied to &s;elf-intere&s;ts, who&s;e avarice is for &s;ome commu|nity; men to whom per&s;onal poverty is honour, and implicit obedience &s;tands in the place of freedom. In vain &s;hall a man look to the po&s;&s;ibility of making &s;uch things when he wants them. The winds blow as they li&s;t. The&s;e in&s;titutions are the products of enthu&s;ia&s;m; they are the in&s;truments of wi&s;dom. Wi&s;dom cannot create materials; they are the gifts of nature or of chance; her pride is in the u&s;e. The perennial exi&s;tence of bodies corporate and their fortunes, are things particularly &s;uited to a man who has long views; who meditates de&s;igns that require time in fa&s;hioning; and which propo&s;e duration when they are accompli&s;hed. He is not de&s;erving to rank high, or even to be mentioned in the order of great &s;tate&s;men, who, having obtained the command and direction of &s;uch a power as exi&s;ted in the wealth, the di&s;cipline, and the habits of &s;uch

This I do not mean to di&s;pute; but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf any re&s;ources which may thence be furni&s;hed for the public advantage. You derive benefits from many di&s;po&s;itions and many pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, which are of as doubtful a colour in the mo|ral eye, as &s;uper&s;tition it&s;elf. It was your bu&s;ine&s;s to correct and mitigate every thing which was noxious in this pa&s;&s;ion, as in all the pa&s;&s;ions. But is &s;uper&s;tition the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;i|ble vices? In its po&s;&s;ible exce&s;s I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a moral &s;ubject; and of cour&s;e admits of all degrees and all modifications.

Wi&s;e men, who as &s;uch, are not <HI>admirers</HI> (not admirers at lea&s;t of the <HI>Munera Terrae</HI>) are not violently attached to the&s;e things, nor do they violently hate them.

They are the rival follies, which mutually wage &s;o unrelenting a war; and which make &s;o cruel a u&s;e of their advantages, as they can happen to engage the immode|rate vulgar on the one &s;ide or the other in their quarrels. Pru|dence would be neuter; but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce &s;uch heats, a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and exce&s;&s;es of enthu|&s;ia&s;m he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think, that which builds, to be more tolerable than that which demo|li&s;hnes&mdash;that which adorns a country, than that which deforms it&mdash;that which endows, than that which plunder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;that which di&s;po&s;es to mi&s;taken beneficence, than that which &s;timulates to real inju&s;tice&mdash;that which leads a man to refu&s;e to him&s;elf lawful plea&s;ures, than that which &s;natches from others the &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their &s;elf-denial.

<P>In every pro&s;perous community &s;omething more is produced than goes to the immediate &s;upport of the producer. This &s;ur|plus forms the income of the landed capitali&s;t.

The only concern of the &s;tate is, that the capital taken in rent from the land, &s;hould be returned again to the indu&s;try from whence it came; and that its expenditure &s;hould be with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible detriment to the morals of tho&s;e who expend it, and to tho&s;e of the people to whom it is returned.</P>

Humanity, and perhaps policy, might better ju&s;tify me in the one than in the other. It is a &s;ubject on which I have often reflected, and never reflected without feeling from it.

<P>This letter is grown to a great length, though it is indeed &s;hort with regard to the infinite extent of the &s;ubject.

Tho&s;e who&s;e principle it is to de&s;pi&s;e the antient permanent &s;en&s;e of mankind, and to &s;et up a &s;cheme of &s;ociety on new principles, mu&s;t naturally expect, that &s;uch of us who think better of the judgment of the human race than of theirs, &s;hould con&s;ider both them and their devices, as men and &s;chemes upon their trial. They mu&s;t take it for granted, that we attend much to their rea&s;on, but not at all to their authority. They have not one of the great influencing prejudices of mankind in their favour. They avow their ho&s;tility to opinion. Of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t expect no &s;upport from that influence, which, with every other authority, they have depo&s;ed from the &s;eat of its juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>I can never con&s;ider this a&s;&s;embly as any thing el&s;e than a volun|tary a&s;&s;ociation of men, who have availed them&s;elves of circum|&s;tances to &s;eize upon the power of the &s;tate. They have not the &s;anction and authority of the character under which they fir&s;t met. They have a&s;&s;umed another of a very different nature; and have completely altered and inverted all the relations in which they originally &s;tood. They do not hold the authority they exerci&s;e under any con&s;titutional law of the &s;tate. They have departed from the in&s;tructions of the people by whom they were &s;ent; which in&s;tructions, as the a&s;&s;embly did not act in virtue of any antient u&s;age or &s;ettled law, were the &s;ole &s;ource of their authority. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of their acts have not been done by great majorities; and in this &s;ort of near divi&s;ions, which carry only the con&s;tructive authority of the whole, &s;trangers will con&s;ider rea&s;ons as well as re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>If they had &s;et up this new experimental government as a nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ub&s;titute for an expelled tyranny, mankind would anticipate the time of pre&s;cription, which, through long u&s;age, mellows into legality governments that were violent in their commencement.

But they will be late and reluctant in giving any &s;ort of countenance to the operations of a power, which has derived its birth from no law and no nece&s;|&s;ity; but which, on the contrary, has had its origin in tho&s;e vices

<P>In obtaining and &s;ecuring their power, the a&s;&s;embly proceeds upon principles the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite from tho&s;e which appear to direct them in the u&s;e of it. An ob&s;ervation on this difference will let us into the true &s;pirit of their conduct. Every thing which they have done, or continue to do, in order to obtain and keep their power, is by the mo&s;t common arts. They proceed exactly as their ance&s;tors of ambition have done before them. Trace them through all their artifices, frauds, and violences, you can find nothing at all that is new. They follow precedents and examples with the punctilious exactne&s;s of a pleader. They never depart an iota from the authentic formulus of tyranny and u&s;urpation. But in all the regulations relative to the public good, the &s;pirit has been the very rever&s;e of this. There they commit the whole to the mercy of untried &s;peculations; they abandon the deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts of the public, to tho&s;e loo&s;e theories to which none of them would chu&s;e to tru&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t of his private concerns. They make this difference, becau&s;e in their de&s;ire of obtaining and &s;ecur|ing power, they are thoroughly in earne&s;t; there they travel in the beaten road. The public intere&s;ts, becau&s;e about them they have no real &s;olicitude, they abandon wholly to chance; I &s;ay to chance, becau&s;e their &s;chemes have nothing in experience to prove their tendency beneficial.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t always &s;ee with a pity not unmixed with re&s;pect, the errors of tho&s;e who are timid and doubtful of them&s;elves with re|gard to points wherein the happine&s;s of mankind is concerned.

Difficult is a &s;evere in|&s;tructor &s;et over us by the &s;upreme ordinance of a parental guardian and legi&s;lator, who knows us better than we know our&s;elves, as he loves us better too. <HI>Pater ip&s;e colendi haud facilem e&s;&s;e viam voluit.</HI> He that wre&s;tles with us &s;trengthens our nerves, and &s;harpens our &s;kill. Our antagoni&s;t is our helper. This amicable conflict with difficulty obliges us to an intimate acquaintance with our object, and compels us to con&s;ider it in all its relations. It will not &s;uffer us to be &s;uperficial. It is the want of nerves of under&s;tanding for &s;uch a ta&s;k; it is the degenerate fondne&s;s for tricking &s;hort-cuts, and little fallacious facilities, that has in &s;o many parts of the world created governments with arbitrary powers. They have created the late arbitrary monarchy of France. They have created the arbitrary republic of Paris. With them defects in wi&s;dom are to be &s;upplied by the plenitude of force. They get nothing by it. Commencing their labours on a principle of &s;loth, they have the common fortune of &s;lothful men. The difficulties which they ra|ther had eluded than e&s;caped, meet them again in their cour&s;e; they multiply and thicken on them; they are involved, through a labyrinth of confu&s;ed detail, in an indu&s;try without limit, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out direction; and, in conclu&s;ion, the whole of their work b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feeble, vitious, and in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>It is this inability to wre&s;tle with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulty which has obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the arbitrary a&s;&s;embly of France to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence their &s;chemes of re|form with abolition and total de&s;truction. But is it in de&s;troying and pulling down that &s;kill is di&s;played? Your mob can do this as well at lea&s;t as your a&s;&s;emblies. The &s;hallowe&s;t under&s;tanding, the rude&s;t hand, is more than equal to that ta&s;k. Rage and phrenzy will pull down more in half an hour, than prudence, deliberation, and fore&s;ight can build up in an hundred years. The errors and defects of old e&s;tabli&s;hments are vi&s;ible and palpable. It calls for
<PB N="136" REF="023238_0138_0FBED5A01A7018D0">
little ability to point them out; and where ab&s;olute power is given, it requires but a word wholly to aboli&s;h the vice and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment together. The &s;ame lazy but re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, which loves &s;loth and hates quiet, directs the&s;e politicians, when they come to work, for &s;upplying the place of what they have de&s;troyed. To make every thing the rever&s;e of what they have &s;een is quite as ea&s;y as to de&s;troy. No difficulties occur in what has never been tried. Critici&s;m is almo&s;t baffled in di&s;covering the defects of what has not exi&s;ted; and eager enthu&s;ia&s;m, and cheating hope, have all the wide field of imagination in which they may expatiate with little or no oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>At once to pre&s;erve and to reform is quite another thing. When the u&s;eful parts of an old e&s;tabli&s;hment are kept, and what is &s;u|peradded is to be fitted to what is retained, a vigorous mind, &s;teady per&s;evering attention, various powers of compari&s;on and combi|nation, and the re&s;ources of an under&s;tanding fruitful in expedi|ents are to be exerci&s;ed; they are to be exerci&s;ed in a continued conflict with the combined force of oppo&s;ite vices; with the ob|&s;tinacy that rejects all improvement, and the levity that is fatigued and di&s;gu&s;ted with every thing of which it is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But you may object&mdash;<Q>A proce&s;s of this kind is &s;low. It is not fit for an a&s;&s;embly, which glories in performing in a few months the work of ages. Such a mode of reforming, po&s;&s;ibly might take up many years.</Q> Without que&s;tion it might; and it ought. It is one of the excellencies of a method in which time is among&s;t the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, that its operation is &s;low, and in &s;ome ca&s;es almo&s;t imperceptible. If circum&s;pection and caution are a part of wi&s;|dom, when we work only upon inanimate matter, &s;urely they be|come a part of duty too, when the &s;ubject of our demolition and con&s;truction is not brick and timber, but &s;entient beings, by the &s;udden alteration of who&s;e &s;tate, condition, and habits, multitudes may be rendered mi&s;erable. But it &s;eems as if it were the preva|lent opinion in Paris, that an unfeeling heart, and an undoubting confidence, are the &s;ole qualifications for a perfect legi&s;lator. Far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent are my ideas of that high office. The true law-give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have an heart full of &s;en&s;ibility.

Political arrangement, as it is a work for &s;ocial ends, is to be only wrought by &s;ocial means. There mind mu&s;t con&s;pire with mind. Time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can pro|duce all the good we aim at. Our patience will atchieve more than our force. If I might venture to appeal to what is &s;o much out of fa&s;hion in Paris, I mean to experience, I &s;hould tell you, that in my cour&s;e I have known, and, according to my mea&s;ure,
<PB N="137" REF="023238_0139_0FBED5A423D0EA30">
have co-operated with great men; and I have never yet &s;een any plan which has not been mended by the ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e who were much inferior in under&s;tanding to the per&s;on who took the lead in the bu&s;ine&s;s. By a &s;low but well-&s;u&s;tained progre&s;s, the effect of each &s;tep is watched; the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t, gives light to us in the &s;econd; and &s;o, from light to light, we are conducted with &s;afety through the whole &s;eries. We &s;ee, that the parts of the &s;y&s;tem do not cla&s;h. The evils latent in the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing contrivances are provided for as they ari&s;e. One advantage is as little as po&s;&s;ible &s;acrificed to another. We compen&s;ate, we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to unite into a con&s;i&s;tent whole the various anomalies and contending principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men. From hence ari&s;es, not an excellence in &s;implicity, but one far &s;uperior, an excellence in compo&s;ition. Where the great intere&s;ts of mankind are concerned through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion ought to be admitted into &s;ome &s;hare in the councils which are &s;o deeply to affect them. If ju&s;tice requires this, the work it&s;elf requires the aid of more minds than one age can furni&s;h. It is from this view of things that the be&s;t legi&s;lators have been often &s;atisfied with the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ome &s;ure, &s;olid, and ruling principle in govern|ment; a power like that which &s;ome of the philo&s;ophers have called a pla&s;tic nature; and having fixed the principle, they have left it afterwards to its own operation.</P>
<P>To proceed in this manner, that is, to proceed with a pre&s;iding principle, and a prolific energy, is with me the criterion of pro|found wi&s;dom. What your politicians think the marks of a bold, hardy genius, are only proofs of a deplorable want of ability. By their violent ha&s;te, and their defiance of the proofs of nature, they are delivered over blindly to every projector and adventurer, to every alchymi&s;t and empiric. They de&s;pair of turning to account any thing that is common. Diet is nothing in their &s;y&s;tem of re|medy. The wor&s;t of it is, that this their de&s;pair of curing com|mon di&s;tempers by regular methods, ari&s;es not only from defect of comprehen&s;ion, but, I fear, from &s;ome malignity of di&s;po&s;ition. Your legi&s;lators &s;eem to have taken their opinions of all profe&s;&s;ions, ranks, and offices, from the declamations and huffooneries of &s;a|tiri&s;ts; who would them&s;elves be a&s;toni&s;hed if they were held to the letter of their own de&s;criptions. By li&s;tening only to the&s;e, your leaders regard all things only on the &s;ide of their vices and faults, and view tho&s;e vices and faults under every colour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|aggeration. It is undoubtedly true, though it may &s;eem parado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|cal; but in general, tho&s;e who are habitually employed in finding and di&s;playing faults, are unqualified for the work of reformation; becau&s;e their minds are not only unfurni&s;hed with patterns of the fair and good, but by habit they come to take no delight in the
<PB N="138" REF="023238_0140_0FBED5A6676A6888">
contemplation of tho&s;e things. By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little. It is therefore not wonderful, that they &s;hould be indi&s;po&s;ed and unable to &s;erve them. From hence ari&s;es the complexional di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of your guides to pull every thing in pieces. At this malicious game they di&s;play the whole of their <HI>quadrimanous</HI> activity. As to the re&s;t, the para|doxes of eloquent writers, brought forth purely as a &s;port of fancy, to try their talents, to rouze attention, and excite &s;urprize, are taken up by the&s;e gentlemen, not in the &s;pirit of the original au|thors, as means of cultivating their ta&s;te and improving their &s;tyle. The&s;e paradoxes become with them &s;erious grounds of action, upon which they proceed in regulating the mo&s;t important concerns of the &s;tate. Cicero ludicrou&s;ly de&s;cribes Cato as endeavouring to act in the commonwealth upon the &s;chool paradoxes which exer|ci&s;ed the wits of the junior &s;tudents in the &s;toic philo&s;ophy. If this was true of Cato, the&s;e gentlemen copy after him in the man|ner of &s;ome per&s;ons who lived about his time&mdash;<HI>pede nudo Catonem.</HI> Mr. Hume told me, that he had from Rou&s;&s;eau him&s;elf the &s;ecret of his principles of compo&s;ition. That acute, though eccentric, ob&s;erver had perceived, that to &s;trike and intere&s;t the public, the marvellous mu&s;t be produced; that the marvellous of the heathen mythology had long &s;ince lo&s;t its effect; that giants, magicians, fairies, and heroes of romance which &s;ucceeded, had exhau&s;ted the portion of credulity which belonged to their age; that now nothing was left to a writer but that &s;pecies of the marvellous, which might &s;till be produced, and with as great an effect as ever, though in another way; that this, the marvellous in life, in man|ners, in characters, and in extraordinary &s;ituations, giving ri&s;e to new and unlooked for &s;trokes in politics and morals. I believe, that were Rou&s;&s;eau alive, and in one of his lucid intervals, he would be &s;hocked at the practical phrenzy of his &s;cholars, who in their paradoxes are &s;ervile imitators; and even in their incredulity di&s;cover an implicit faith.</P>
<P>Men who undertake con&s;iderable things, even in a regular way, ought to give us ground to pre&s;ume ability. But the phy&s;ician of the &s;tate, who, not &s;atisfied with the cure of di&s;tempers, undertakes to regenerate con&s;titutions, ought to &s;hew uncommon powers. Some very unu&s;ual appearances of wi&s;dom ought to di&s;play them|&s;elves on the face of the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who appeal to no practice, and who copy after no model. Has any &s;uch been manife&s;ted? I &s;hall take a view (it &s;hall for the &s;ubject be a very &s;hort one) of what the a&s;&s;embly has done, with regard, fir&s;t, to the con&s;titution of the legi&s;lature; in the next place, to that of the executive power; then to that of the judicature; afterwards to the model of the army&punc; and conclude with the &s;y&s;tem of finance, to &s;ee whether we can di&s;cover in any part of their &s;chemes the portentous
<PB N="139" REF="023238_0141_0FBED5A7B60763F0">
ability, which may ju&s;tify the&s;e bold undertakers in the &s;uperiority which they a&s;&s;ume over mankind.</P>
<P>It is in the model of the &s;overeign and pre&s;iding part of this new republic, that we &s;hould expect their grand di&s;play. Here they were to prove their title to their proud demands. For the plan it&s;elf at large, and for the rea&s;ons on which it is grounded, I refer to the journals of the a&s;&s;embly of the 29th of September, 1789, and to the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings which have made any alterations in the plan. So far as in a matter &s;omewhat confu&s;ed I can &s;ee light, the &s;y&s;tem remains &s;ub&s;tantially as it has been origi|nally framed. My few remarks will be &s;uch as regard its &s;pirit, its tendency, and its fitne&s;s for framing a popular commonwealth, which they profe&s;s theirs to be, &s;uited to the ends for which any commonwealth, and particularly &s;uch a commonwealth, is made. At the &s;ame time, I mean to con&s;ider its con&s;i&s;tency with it&s;elf, and its own principles.</P>
<P>Old e&s;tabli&s;hments are tried by their effects. If the people are happy, united, wealthy, and powerful, we pre&s;ume the re&s;t. We conclude that to be good from whence good is derived. In old e&s;tabli&s;hments various correctives have been found for their aberra|tions from theory. Indeed they are the re&s;ults of various nece&s;&s;i|ties and expediencies. They are not often con&s;tructed after any theory; theories are rather drawn from them. In them we often &s;ee the end be&s;t obtained, where the means &s;eem not perfectly re|concileable to what we may fancy was the original &s;cheme. The means taught by experience may be better &s;uited to political ends than tho&s;e contrived in the original project. They again re-act vpon the primitive con&s;titution, and &s;ometimes improve the de&s;ign it&s;elf from which they &s;eem to have departed. I think all this might be curiou&s;ly exemplified in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. At wor&s;t, the errors and deviations of every kind in reckoning are found and computed, and the &s;hip proceeds in her cour&s;e. This is the ca&s;e of old e&s;tabli&s;hments; but in a new and merely theo|retic &s;y&s;tem, it is expected that every contrivance &s;hall appear, on the face of it, to an&s;wer its end; e&s;pecially where the projectors are no way embarra&s;&s;ed with an endeavour to accommodate the new building to an old one, either in the walls or on the foun|dations.</P>
<P>The French builders, clearing away as mere rubbi&s;h whatever they found, and, like their ornamental gardeners, forming every thing into an exact level, propo&s;e to re&s;t the whole local and gene|ral legi&s;lature on three ba&s;is of three different kinds; one geome|trical, one arithmetical, and the third financial; the fir&s;t of which they call the <HI>ba&s;is of territory;</HI> the &s;econd, the <HI>ba&s;is of population;</HI> and the third, the <HI>ba&s;is of contribution.</HI> For the accompli&s;hment of the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es they divide the area of their country
<PB N="140" REF="023238_0142_0FBED5AC4456A438">
into eighty-one pieces, regularly &s;quare, of eighteen leagues by eighteen. The&s;e large divi&s;ions are called <HI>Departments.</HI> The&s;e they portion, proceeding by &s;quare mea&s;urement, into &s;eventeen hundred and twenty di&s;tricts called <HI>Communes.</HI> The&s;e again they &s;ub-divide, &s;till proceeding by &s;quare mea&s;urement, into &s;maller di&s;tricts called <HI>Cantons,</HI> making in all 6400.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t view this geometrical ba&s;is of theirs pre&s;ents not much to admire or to blame. It calls for no great legi&s;lative talents. Nothing more than an accurate land &s;urveyor, with his chain, &s;ight, and theodolite, is requi&s;ite for &s;uch a plan as this. In the old di|vi&s;ions of the country various accidents at various times, and the ebb and flow of various properties and juri&s;dictions, &s;ettled their bounds. The&s;e bounds were not made upon any fixed &s;y&s;tem un|doubtedly. They were &s;ubject to &s;ome inconveniencies; but they were inconveniencies for which u&s;e had found remedies, and habit had &s;upplied accommodation and patience. In this new pavement of &s;quare within &s;quare, and this organization and &s;emi-organization made on the &s;y&s;tem of Empedocles and Buffon, and not upon any politic principle, it is impo&s;&s;ible that innumerable local inconveni|encies, to which men are not habituated, mu&s;t not ari&s;e. But the&s;e I pa&s;s over, becau&s;e it requires an accurate knowledge of the country, which I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, to &s;pecify them.</P>
<P>When the&s;e &s;tate &s;urveyors came to take a view of their work of mea&s;urement, they &s;oon found, that in politics, the mo&s;t fallaci|ous of all things was geometrical demon&s;tration. They had then recour&s;e to another ba&s;is (or rather buttre&s;s) to &s;upport the building which tottered on that fal&s;e foundation. It was evident, that the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, the number of the people, their wealth, and the largene&s;s of their contribution, made &s;uch infinite variations between &s;qurae and &s;quare as to render men&s;uration a ridiculous &s;tandard of power in the commonwealth, and equality in geometry the mo&s;t unequal of all mea&s;ures in the di&s;tribution of men. However, they could not give it up. But dividing their political and civil repre&s;entation into three parts, they allotted one of tho&s;e parts to the &s;quare mea&s;urement, without a &s;ingle fact or calculation to a&s;certain whether this territorial proportion of repre&s;entation was fairly a&s;&s;igned, and ought upon any principle really to be a third. Having however given to geometry this portion (of a third for her dower) out of compliment I &s;uppo&s;e to that &s;ublime &s;cience, they left the other two to be &s;cuffled for between the other parts, of po|pulation and contribution.</P>
<P>When they came to provide for population, they were not able to proceed quite &s;o &s;moothly as they had done in the field of their geometry. Here their arithmetic came to bear upon their juridi|cal metaphy&s;ics. Had they &s;tuck to their metaphy&s;ic principles, the arithmetical proce&s;s would be &s;imple indeed. Men, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="141" REF="023238_0143_0FBED5B02CBEDD50">
are &s;trictly equal, and are entitled to equal rights in their own government. Each head, on this &s;y&s;tem, would have its vote, and every man would vote directly for the per&s;on who was to re|pre&s;ent him in the legi&s;lature. <Q>But &s;oft&mdash;by regular de|grees, not yet.</Q> This metaphy&s;ic principle, to which law, cu&s;tom, u&s;age, policy, rea&s;on, were to yield, is to yield it&s;elf to their plea&s;ure. There mu&s;t be many degrees, and &s;ome &s;tages, before the repre&s;entative can come in contact with his con&s;tituent. Indeed, as we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, the&s;e two per&s;ons are to have no &s;ort of communion with each other. Fir&s;t, the voters in the <HI>Canton,</HI> who compo&s;e what they call <HI>primary a&s;&s;em|blies,</HI> are to have a <HI>qualification.</HI> What! a qualification on the indefea&s;ible rights of men? Yes; but it &s;hall be a very &s;mall qualification. Our inju&s;tice &s;hall be very little oppre&s;&s;ive; only the local valuation of three days labour paid to the public. Why, this is not much, I readily admit, for any thing but the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of your equali&s;ing principle. As a qualifica|tion it might as well be let alone; for it an&s;wers no one pur|po&s;e for which qualifications are e&s;tabli&s;hed: and, on your ideas, it excludes from a vote, the man of all others who&s;e na|tural equality &s;tands the mo&s;t in need of protection and defence; I mean the man who has nothing el&s;e but his natural equality to guard him. You order him to buy the right, which you before told him nature had given to him gratuitou&s;ly at his birth, and of which no authority on earth could lawfully de|prive him. With regard to the per&s;on who cannot come up to your market, a tyrannous ari&s;tocracy, as again&s;t him, is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by you who pretend to be its &s;worn foe.</P>
<P>The gradation proceeds. The&s;e primary a&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>Canton</HI> elect deputies to the <HI>Commune;</HI> one for every two hun|dred qualified inhabitants. Here is the fir&s;t medium put be|tween the primary elector and the repre&s;entative legi&s;lator; and here a new turnpike is fixed for taxing the rights of men with a &s;econd qualification; for none can be elected into the <HI>Commune</HI> who does not pay the amount of ten days labour. Nor have we yet done. There is &s;till to be another gradation. The&s;e <HI>Communes,</HI> cho&s;en by the <HI>Canton,</HI> choo&s;e to the <HI>Depart|ment;</HI> and the deputies of the <HI>Department</HI> choo&s;e their deputies to the <HI>National A&s;&s;embly.</HI> Here is a third barrier of a &s;en&s;ele&s;s qualification. Every deputy to the national a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t pay, in direct contribution, to the value of a <HI>mark of &s;ilver.</HI> Of all the&s;e qualifying barriers we mu&s;t think alike; that they are impotent to &s;ecure independence; &s;trong only to de&s;troy the rights of men.</P>
<P>In all this proce&s;s, which in its fundamental elements affects to con&s;ider only <HI>population</HI> upon a principle of natural right, there
<PB N="142" REF="023238_0144_0FBED5B163E5FCB8">
is a manife&s;t attention to <HI>property;</HI> which, however ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable on other &s;chemes, is on theirs perfectly un&s;upportable.</P>
<P>When they come to their third ba&s;is, that of <HI>Contribution;</HI> we find that they have more completely lo&s;t &s;ight of their rights of men. This la&s;t ba&s;is re&s;ts <HI>entirely</HI> on property. A principle totally different from the equality of men, and utterly irrecon|cileable to it, is thereby admitted; but no &s;ooner is this prin|ciple, which is a principle regarding property, admitted, than (as u&s;ual) it is &s;ubverted; and it is not &s;ubverted, (as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee,) to approximate the inequality of riches to the level of nature. The additional &s;hare in the third portion of repre&s;entation, (a portion re&s;erved exclu&s;ively for the higher contribution,) is made to regard the <HI>di&s;trict</HI> only, and not the individuals in it who pay. It is ea&s;y to perceive, by the cour&s;e of their rea&s;onings, how much they were embarra&s;&s;ed by their contradictory ideas of the rights of men and the privileges of riches. The committe of con&s;titution do as good as admit that they are wholly irreconcileable. <Q>The relation, with regard to the contributions, is without doubt <HI>null</HI> (&s;ay they) when the que&s;tion is on the balance of the political rights as be|tween individual and individual; without which <HI>per&s;onal equality would be de&s;troyed,</HI> and <HI>an ari&s;trocracy of the rich</HI> would be e&s;tabli&s;hed. But this inconvenience entirely di&s;|appears when the proportional relation of the contribution is only con&s;idered in the <HI>great ma&s;&s;es,</HI> and is &s;olely between pro|vince and province; it &s;erves in that ca&s;e only to form a ju&s;t reciprocal proportion between the cities, without affecting the per&s;onal rights of the citizens.</Q></P>
<P>Here the principle of <HI>contribution,</HI> as taken between man and man, is reprobated as <HI>null,</HI> and de&s;tructive to equality; and as pernicious too; becau&s;e it leads to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an <HI>ari&s;trocracy of the rich.</HI> However, it mu&s;t not be abandoned. And the way of getting rid of the difficulty is to e&s;tabli&s;h the inequality as between department and department, leaving all the individuals in each department upon an exact par. Ob|&s;erve, that this parity between individuals had been before de|&s;troyed when the qualifications within the departments were &s;ettled; nor does it &s;eem a matter of great importance whether the equality of men be injured by ma&s;&s;es or individually. An individual is not of the &s;ame importance in a ma&s;s repre&s;ented by a few, as in a ma&s;s repre&s;ented by many. It would be too much to tell a man jealous of his equality, that the elector has the &s;ame franchi&s;e who votes for free members as he who vote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for ten.</P>
<P>Now take it in the other point of view, and &s;uppo&s;e their principle of repre&s;entation according to contribution, that is,
<PB N="143" REF="023238_0145_0FBED5B2E3BD1BE0">
according to <HI>riches,</HI> to be well founded, and to be a nece&s;&s;ary ba&s;is for the republic, how have they provided for the rich by giving to the di&s;trict, that is to &s;ay, to the poor in the di&s;trict of <HI>Canton</HI> and <HI>Commune,</HI> who are the majority, the power of making an additional number of members on account of the &s;uperior contribution of the wealthy? Suppo&s;e one man (it is an ea&s;y &s;uppo&s;ition) to contribute ten times more than ten of his neighbours. For this contribution he has one vote out of ten. The poor outvote him by nine voices in virtue of his &s;uperior contribution, for (&s;ay) <HI>ten</HI> members, in&s;tead of out-voting him for only one member. Why are the rich complimented with an ari&s;trocratic preference, which they can never feel either a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a gratification to pride, or as a &s;ecurity to fortune? The rich in|deed require an additional &s;ecurity from the dangers to which they are expo&s;ed when a popular power is prevalent; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to divine, on this &s;y&s;tem of unequal ma&s;&s;es, how they are protected; becau&s;e the ari&s;trocratic ma&s;s is generated from democratic principles; and the prevalence in the general re|pre&s;entation has no &s;ort of connection with tho&s;e on account of who&s;e property this &s;uperiority is given. If the contrivers of this &s;cheme meant any &s;ort of favour to the rich in con&s;equence of their contribution, they ought to have conferred the privi|lege either on the individual rich, or on &s;ome cla&s;s formed of rich per&s;ons; becau&s;e the conte&s;t between the rich and the poor is not a &s;truggle between corporation and corporation, but a con|te&s;t between men and men; a competition not between di&s;tricts, but between de&s;criptions. It would an&s;wer its purpo&s;e better if the &s;cheme was inverted; that the votes of the ma&s;&s;es were rendered equal; and that the votes within each ma&s;s were pro|portioned to property. In any other light, I &s;ee nothing but danger from the inequality of the ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If indeed the ma&s;&s;es were to provide for the general trea&s;ury by di&s;tinct contingents, and that the revenue had not (as it has) many impo&s;itions running through the whole, which effect men individually, and not corporately, and which, by their nature, confound all territorial limits, &s;omething might be &s;aid for the ba&s;is of contribution as founded on ma&s;&s;es. But of all things, this repre&s;entation, to be mea&s;ured by contribution, is the mo&s;t difficult to &s;ettle upon principles of equity, in a country which con&s;iders its di&s;tricts as members of an whole. For a great city, &s;uch as Bourdeaux or Paris, appears to pay a va&s;t body of duties, almo&s;t out of all a&s;&s;ignable proportion to other places, and its ma&s;s is con&s;idered accordingly. But are the&s;e cities the true contributors in that proportion? No. The con&s;umers of the commodities imported into Bourdeaux, who are &s;cattered through all France, pay the import duties of
<PB N="144" REF="023238_0146_0FBED5B47487FF80">
Bourdeaux. The produce of the vintage in Guienne and Lan|guedoc give to that city the means of its contribution growing out of an export commerce. The landholders who &s;pend their e&s;tates in Paris, and are thereby the creators of that city, con|tributed for Paris from the provinces out of which their reve|nues ari&s;e.</P>
<P>If in equity this ba&s;is of contribution, as locally a&s;certained by ma&s;&s;es, be inequitable, it is impolitic too. If it be one of the objects to pre&s;erve the weak from being cru&s;hed by the &s;trong (as in all &s;ociety undoubtedly it is) how are the &s;maller and poorer of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aved from the tyranny of the more wealthy? Is it by adding to their means of oppre&s;&s;ing them? When we come to a balance of repre&s;entation between corporate bodies, provincial intere&s;ts, emulations, and jea|lou&s;ies are full as likely to ari&s;e among them as among indivi|duals; and their divi&s;ions are likely to produce much hotter di&s;&s;ention, and &s;omething leading much more nearly to war.</P>
<P>To compare together the three ba&s;es, not on their political rea&s;on, but on the ideas on which the a&s;&s;embly works, and to try its con&s;i&s;tency with it&s;elf, we cannot avoid ob&s;erving, that the principle which the committee call the ba&s;is of <HI>population,</HI> does not begin to operate from the &s;ame point with the two other principles called the ba&s;es of <HI>territory</HI> and of <HI>contribution,</HI> which are both of an ari&s;tocratic nature. The con&s;equence is, that where all three begin to operate together, there is the mo&s;t ab&s;urd inequality produced by the operation of the former on the two latter principles. Every canton contains four &s;quare leagues and is e&s;timated to contain, on the average, 4,000 inhabitants, or 680 voters in the <HI>primary a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> which vary in numbers with the population of the canton, and &s;end <HI>one deputy</HI> to the <HI>commune</HI> for every 200 voters. <HI>Nine cantons</HI> make a <HI>commune.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us take <HI>a canton</HI> containing <HI>a &s;ea-port town of trade,</HI> or <HI>a great manufacturing town.</HI> Let us &s;uppo&s;e the population of this canton to be 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters, forming <HI>three primary a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and &s;ending <HI>ten deputies</HI> to the <HI>commune.</HI></P>
<P>Oppo&s;e to this <HI>one</HI> canton <HI>two</HI> others of the remaining eight in the &s;ame commune. The&s;e we may &s;uppo&s;e to have their fair population of 4,000 inhabitants, and 680 voters each, or 8,000 inhabitants and 1,360 voters, both together. The&s;e will form only <HI>two primary a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and &s;end only <HI>&s;ix</HI> deputies to the <HI>commune.</HI></P>
<P>When the a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>commune</HI> comes to vote on the <HI>ba&s;is of territory,</HI> which principle is fir&s;t admitted to operate in that a&s;&s;embly, the <HI>&s;ingle canton</HI> which has <HI>half</HI> the territory of the
<PB N="145" REF="023238_0147_0FBED5BDB0C30070">
<HI>other two,</HI> will have <HI>ten</HI> voices to <HI>&s;ix</HI> in the election of <HI>three de|puties</HI> to the a&s;&s;embly of the department, cho&s;en on the expre&s;s ground of a repre&s;entation of territory.</P>
<P>This inequality, &s;triking as it is, will be yet highly aggra|vated, if we &s;uppo&s;e, as we fairly may, the <HI>&s;everal</HI> other cantons of the <HI>commune</HI> to fall proportionably &s;hort of the ave|rage population, as much as the <HI>principal canton</HI> exceeds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Now, as to <HI>the ba&s;is of contribution,</HI> which al&s;o is a principle admitted fir&s;t to operate in the a&s;&s;embly of the <HI>commune.</HI> Let us again take <HI>one</HI> canton, &s;uch as is &s;tated above. If the whole of the direct contributions paid by a great trading or manu|facturing town be divided equally among the inhabitants, each individual will be found to pay much more than an indivi|dual living in the country according to the &s;ame average. The whole paid by the inhabitants of the former will be more than the whole paid by the inhabitants of the latter&mdash;we may fairly a&s;&s;ume one-third more. Then the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of the canton will pay as much as 19,050 inha|bitants, or 3,289 voters of the <HI>other cantons,</HI> which are nearly the e&s;timated proportion of inhabitants and voters of <HI>five</HI> other cantons. Now the 2,193 voters will, as I before &s;aid, &s;end only <HI>ten</HI> deputies to the a&s;&s;embly; the 3,289 voters will &s;end <HI>&s;ixteen.</HI> Thus, for an <HI>equal</HI> &s;hare in the contribution of the whole <HI>commune,</HI> there will be a difference of <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> voices to <HI>ten</HI> in voting for deputies to be cho&s;en on the principle of repre|&s;enting the general contribution of the whole <HI>commune.</HI></P>
<P>By the &s;ame mode of computation we &s;hall find 15,875 inha|bitants, or 2,741 voters of the <HI>other</HI> cantons, who pay <HI>one-&s;ixth</HI> LESS to the contribution of the whole <HI>commune,</HI> will have <HI>three</HI> voices MORE than the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of the <HI>one</HI> canton.</P>
<P>Such is the fanta&s;tical and unju&s;t inequality between ma&s;s and ma&s;s, in this curious repartition of the rights of repre&s;entation ari&s;ing out of <HI>territory</HI> and <HI>contribution.</HI> The qualifications which the&s;e confer are in truth negative qualifications, that give a right in an inver&s;e proportion to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>In this whole contrivance of the three ba&s;es, con&s;ider it in any light you plea&s;e, I do not &s;ee a variety of objects, recon|ciled in one con&s;i&s;tent whole, but &s;everal contradictory principles reluctantly and irreconcileably brought and held together by you philo&s;ophers, like wild bea&s;ts &s;hut up in a cage, to claw and bite each other to their mutual de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I am afraid I have gone too far into their way of con&s;idering the formation of a con&s;titution. They have much, but bad, metaphy&s;ics, much, but bad, geometry, much, but fal&s;e pro|portionate arithmetic; but if it were all as exact as metaphy&s;ics,
<PB N="146" REF="023238_0148_0FBED7CB07190FF8">
geometry, and arithmetic ought to be, and if their &s;chemes were perfectly con&s;i&s;tent in all their parts, it would make only a more fair and &s;ightly vi&s;ion. It is remarkable, that in a great arrangement of mankind, not one reference what&s;oever is to be found to any thing moral or any thing politic; nothing that relates to the concerns, the actions, the pa&s;&s;ions, the intere&s;ts of men. <HI>Hominem non &s;apiunt.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee I only con&s;ider this con&s;titution as electoral, and leading by &s;teps to the National A&s;&s;embly. I do not enter into the internal government of the Departments, and their gene|alogy through the Communes and Cantons. The&s;e local go|vernments are, in the original plan, to be as nearly as po&s;&s;ible compo&s;ed in the &s;ame manner and on the &s;ame principles with the elective a&s;&s;emblies. They are each of them bodies perfectly compact and rounded in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You cannot but perceive in this &s;cheme, that it has a direct and immediate tendency to &s;ever France into a variety of republics, and to render them totally independent of each other, without any direct con&s;titutional means of coherence, connec|tion, or &s;ubordination, except what may be derived from their acquie&s;cence in the determinations of the general congre&s;s of the amba&s;&s;adors from each independent republic. Such in reality is the National A&s;&s;embly, and &s;uch governments I admit do exi&s;t in the world, though in forms infinitely more &s;uitable to the local and habitual circum&s;tances of their people. But &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations, rather than bodies politic, have generally been the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, not choice; and I believe the pre|&s;ent French power is the very fir&s;t body of citizens, who, ha|ving obtained full authority to do with their country what they plea&s;ed, have cho&s;en to di&s;&s;ever it in this barbarous manner.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve, that in the &s;pirit of this geo|metrical di&s;tribution, and arithmetical arrangement, the&s;e pretended citizens treat France exactly like a country of conque&s;t. Acting as conquerors, they have imitated the policy of the har&s;h|e&s;t of that har&s;h race. The policy of &s;uch barbarous victors, who contemn a &s;ubdued people, and in&s;ult their feelings, has ever been, as much as in them lay, to de&s;troy all ve&s;tigies of the antient country, in religion, in polity, in laws, and in man|ners; to confound all territorial limits; to produce a general poverty; to put up their properties to auction; to cru&s;h their princes, nobles, and pontiffs; to lay low every thing which had lifted its head above the level, or which could &s;erve to combine or rally, in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the di&s;banded people, under the &s;tandard of old opinion. They have made France free in the manner in which tho&s;e &s;incere friends to the rights of mankind, the Romans, freed Greece, Macedon, and other

nations. They de&s;troyed the bonds of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> union, under co|lour of providing for the independence of each of their cities.</P>
<P>When the members who compo&s;e the&s;e new bodies of can|tons, communes, and departments, arrangements purpo&s;ely produced through the medium of confu&s;ion, begin to act, they will find them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;trangers to one ano|ther. The electors and elected throughout, e&s;pecially in the rural <HI>cantons,</HI> will be frequently without any civil habitudes or connections, or any of that natural di&s;cipline which is the &s;oul of a true republic. Magi&s;trates and collectors of revenue are now no longer acquainted with their di&s;tricts, bi&s;hops with their dioce&s;es, or curates with their pari&s;hes. The&s;e new co|lonies of the rights of men bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to that &s;ort of military colonies which Tacitus has ob&s;erved upon in the declining policy of Rome. In better and wi&s;er days (what|ever cour&s;e they took with foreign nations) they were careful to make the elements of a methodical &s;ubordination and &s;et|tlement to be coeval; and even to lay the foundations of civil di&s;cipline in the military<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non, ut olim, univer&s;ae legiones deducebantur cum tribunus, et centuri|onibus, et &s;ui cuju&s;que ordinis militibus, ut con&s;en&s;u et caritate rempublicam afficerent; &s;ed ignoti inter &s;e, diver&s;is manipulis, &s;ine rectore, &s;ine affectibus mutuis, qua&s;i ex alio genere mortalium, repente in unum collecti, numerus magis quam colonia.

But, when all the good arts had fallen into ruin, they proceeded, as your a&s;&s;embly does, upon the equality of men, and with as little judgment, and as little care for tho&s;e things which make a republic tolerable or durable.

<P>The confu&s;ion, which attends an all &s;uch proceedings, they even declare to be one of their objects, and they hope to &s;ecure their con&s;titution by a terror of a return of tho&s;e evils which attended their making it. <Q>By this," &s;ay they, "its de&s;truc|tion will become difficult to authority, which cannot break it up without the entire di&s;organization of the whole &s;tate.</Q> They pre&s;ume, that if this authority &s;hould ever come to the &s;ame degree of power that they have acquired, it would make a more moderate and cha&s;ti&s;ed u&s;e of it, and would piou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y tremble entirely to di&s;organi&s;e the &s;tate in the &s;avage manner that they have done.

<P><PB N="148" REF="023238_0150_0FBED7CD5DBAEE70">It is this re&s;olution, to break their country into &s;eperate republics, which has driven them into the greate&s;t number of their difficulties and contradictions. If it were not for this, all the que&s;tions of exact equality, and the&s;e balances never to be &s;ettled, of individual rights, population, and contribution, would be wholly u&s;ele&s;s. The repre&s;entation, though derived from parts, would be a duty which equally regarded the whole. Each deputy to the a&s;&s;embly would be the repre&s;entative of France, and of all its de&s;criptions, of the many and of the few, of the rich and of the poor, of the great di&s;tricts and of the &s;mall. All the&s;e di&s;tricts would them&s;elves be &s;ubordinate to &s;ome &s;tanding authority, exi&s;ting independently of them; an autho|rity in which their repre&s;entation, and every thing that belongs to it, originated, and to which it was po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. This &s;tanding, unalterable, fundamental government would make, and it is the only thing which could make, that territory truly and properly an whole. With us, when we elect popular repre|&s;entatives, we &s;end them to a council, in which each man individualy is a &s;ubject, and &s;ubmitted to a government com|plete in all its ordinary functions. With you the elective a&s;|&s;embly is the &s;overeign, and the &s;ole &s;overeign: all the members are therefore integral parts of this &s;ole &s;overeignty. But with us it is totally different. With us the repre&s;entative, &s;eparated from the other parts, can have no action and no exi&s;tence. The government is the point of reference of the &s;everal members and di&s;tricts of our repre&s;entation. This is the center of our unity. This government of reference is a tru&s;tee for the <HI>whole,</HI> and not for the parts. So is the other branch of our public council, I mean the hou&s;e of lords. With us the king and the lords are &s;everal and joint &s;ecurities for the equality of each di&s;trict, each province, each city. When did you hear in Great Britain of any province &s;uffering from the unequality of its repre&s;entation; what di&s;trict from having no repre&s;entation at all? Not only our monarchy and our peerage &s;ecure the equality on which our unity depends, but it is the &s;pirit of the hou&s;e of commons it&s;elf. The very inequality of repre&s;enta|tion, which is &s;o fooli&s;hly complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us from thinking or acting as members for di&s;tricts. Cornwall elects as many members as all Scotland. But is Cornwall better taken care of than Scotland? Few trouble their heads about any of your ba&s;es, out of &s;ome giddy clubs. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who with for any change, upon any plau&s;ible grounds, de&s;ire it on different ideas.</P>
<P>Your new con&s;titution is the very rever&s;e of ours in its prin|ciple; and I am a&s;toni&s;hed how any per&s;ons could dream of holding out any thing done in it as an example for Great Bri|tain.
<PB N="149" REF="023238_0151_0FBED7CEDC1C0B80">
With you there is little, or rather no, connection be|tween the la&s;t repre&s;entative and the fir&s;t con&s;tituent. The member who goes to the national a&s;&s;embly is not cho&s;en by the people, nor accountable to them. There are three elections before he is cho&s;en: two &s;ets of magi&s;tracy intervene between him and the primary a&s;&s;embly, &s;o as to render him, as I have &s;aid, an amba&s;&s;ador of a &s;tate, and not the repre&s;entative of the people within a &s;tate. By this the whole &s;pirit of the election is changed; nor can any corrective your con&s;titution-mongers have devi&s;ed render him any thing el&s;e than what he is. The very attempt to do it would inevitably introduce a confu&s;ion, if po&s;&s;ible, more horrid than the pre&s;ent. There is no way to make a connection between the original con&s;tituent and the repre&s;entative, but by the circuitous means which may lead the candidate to apply in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the primary electors, in order that by their authoritative in&s;tructions (and &s;omething more perhaps) the&s;e primary electors may force the two &s;ucceeding bodies of electors to make a choice agreeable to their wi&s;hes. But this would plainly &s;ubvert the whole &s;cheme. It would be to plunge them back into that tumult and confu&s;ion of popular election, which, by their interpo&s;ed gradation elections, they mean to avoid, and at length to ri&s;que the whole fortune of the &s;tate with tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t knowledge of it, and the lea&s;t intere&s;t in it. This is a perpetual dilemma, into which they are thrown by the vicious, weak, and contradictory principles they have cho&s;en. Unle&s;s the people break up and level this gradation, it is plain that they do not at all &s;ub&s;tantially elect to the a&s;&s;embly; indeed they elect as little in appearance as reality.</P>
<P>What is it we all &s;eek for in an election? To an&s;wer its real purpo&s;es, you mu&s;t fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of knowing the fitne&s;s of your man; and then you mu&s;t retain &s;ome hold upon him by per&s;onal obligation or dependence. For what end are the&s;e primary electors complimented, or rather mocked, with a choice? They can never know any thing of the qualities of him that is to &s;erve them, nor has he any obligation what&s;oever to them. Of all the powers unfit to be delegated by tho&s;e who have any real means of judging, that mo&s;t peculiarly unfit is what relates to a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> choice, In ca&s;e of abu&s;e, that body of primary electors never can call the repre&s;entative to an account for his conduct. He is too far removed from them in the chain of repre&s;entation. If he acts improperly at the end of his two years lea&s;e, it does not concern him for two years more. By the new French con&s;titution, the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t repre&s;enta|tive go equally with the wor&s;t into this <HI>Limbus Patrum.</HI> Their bottoms are &s;uppo&s;ed foul, and they mu&s;t go into dock to be

Ju&s;t as the&s;e magi&s;trates begin to learn their trade, like chimney-&s;weepers, they are di&s;qualified for exerci&s;ing it.

Your con&s;titution has too much of jealou&s;y to have much of &s;en&s;e in it. You con&s;ider the breach of tru&s;t in the repre&s;entative &s;o principally, that you do not at all regard the que&s;tion of his fitne&s;s to execute it.</P>
<P>This purgatory interval is not unfavourable to a faithle&s;s re|pre&s;entative, who may be as good a canva&s;&s;er as he was a bad governor. In this time he may cabal him&s;elf into a &s;uperiority over the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous. As, in the end, all the mem|bers of this elective con&s;titution are equally fugitive, and exi&s;t only for the election, they may be no longer the &s;ame per&s;ons who had cho&s;en him, to whom he is to be re&s;pon&s;ible when he &s;olicits for a renewal of his tru&s;t.

<P>The legi&s;lators who framed the antient republics knew that their bu&s;ine&s;s was too arduous to be accompli&s;hed with no better apparatus than the metaphi&s;ics of an under-graduate, and the mathematicks and arithmetic of an exci&s;eman.

It is for this rea&s;on that Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erved very ju&s;tly, that in their cla&s;&s;ification of the citizens, the great legi&s;lators of antiquity made the greate&s;t di&s;play of their powers, and even &s;oared above them&s;elves. It is here that your modern legi&s;lators have gone deep into the ne|gative &s;eries, and &s;unk even below their own nothing. As the fir&s;t &s;ort of legi&s;lators attended to the different kinds of ci|tizens, and combined them into one commonwealth, the others the metaphy&s;ical and alchemi&s;tical legi&s;lators, have taken the direct contrary cour&s;e. They have attempted to confound all &s;orts of citizens, as well as they could, into one homogeneous ma&s;s; and then they divided this their amalgama into a num|ber of incoherent republics. They reduce men to loo&s;e coun|ters merely for the &s;ake of &s;imple telling, and not to figures who&s;e power is to ari&s;e from their place in the table. The ele|ments of their own metaphy&s;ics might have taught them better le&s;&s;ons. The troll of their categorical table might have in|formed them that there was &s;omething el&s;e in the intellectual world be&s;ides <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>quantity.</HI> They might learn from the chatechi&s;ms of metaphy&s;ics that there were eight heads more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Qualitas, Relatio, Actio, Pa&s;&s;io, Ubi, Quando, Situs, Habitus.</NOTE>, in every complex deliberation, which they have never thought of, though the&s;e, of all the ten, are the &s;ubject on which the &s;kill of man can operate any thing at all.</P>
<P>So far from this able di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the old republican legi&s;lators, which follows with a &s;olicitous accuracy, the moral conditions and propen&s;ities of men, they have levelled and cru&s;h|ed together all the orders which they found, even under the coar&s;e unartificial arrangement of the monarchy, in which mode of go|vernment the cla&s;&s;ing of the citizens is not of &s;o much importance as in a republic. It is true, however, that every &s;uch cla&s;&s;ifica|tion, if properly ordered, is good in all forms of government; and compo&s;es a &s;trong barrier again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m, as well as it is the nece&s;&s;ary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic. For want of &s;omething of this kind, if the pre|&s;ent project of a republic &s;hould fail, all &s;ecurities to a moderated freedom fail along with it; all the indirect re&s;traints which mitigate de&s;poti&s;m are removed; in&s;omuch that if monarchy &s;hould ever again obtain an entire a&s;cendency in France, under this or under any other dyna&s;ty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily temper|ed at &s;etting out, by the wi&s;e and virtuous coun&s;els of the prince, the mo&s;t competely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth.

Their confederations, their <HI>&s;pec|tacles,</HI> their civic fea&s;ts, and their enthu&s;ia&s;m, I take no notice of: They are nothing but mere tricks; but tracing their policy through their actions, I think I can di&s;tingui&s;h the arrangements by which they propo&s;e to hold the&s;e republics together.

Of this la&s;t I &s;hall re&s;erve what I have to &s;ay, until I come to con&s;ider the army as an head by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the operation of the fir&s;t (the confi&s;cation and paper cur|rency) merely as a cement, I cannot deny that the&s;e, the one de|pending on the other, may for &s;ome time compo&s;e &s;ome &s;ort of cement, if their madne&s;s and folly in the management, and in the tempering of the parts together, does not produce a repul&s;ion in the very out&s;et. But allowing to the &s;cheme &s;ome coherence and &s;ome duration, it appears to me, that if, after a while, the confi&s;cation &s;hould not be found &s;ufficient to &s;upport the paper coinage (as I am morally certain it will not) then, in&s;tead of ce|menting, it will add infinitely to the di&s;&s;ociation, di&s;traction, and confu&s;ion of the&s;e confederate republics, both with relation to each other, and to the &s;everal parts within them&s;elves. But if the confi&s;cation &s;hould &s;o far &s;ucceed as to &s;ink the paper currency, the cement is gone with the circulation. In the mean ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its binding force will be very uncertain, and it will &s;traiten or relax with every variation in the credit of the paper.</P>
<P>One thing only is certain in this &s;cheme, which is an effect &s;eemingly collateral, but direct, I have no doubt, in the minds of tho&s;e who conduct this bu&s;ine&s;s; that is, its effect in producing an <HI>Oligarchy</HI> in every one of the republics. A paper circulation, not founded on any real money depo&s;ited or engaged for, amount|ing already to four-and-forty millions of Engli&s;h money, and this currency by force &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the coin of the king|dom, becoming thereby the &s;ub&s;tance of its revenue, as well as the medium of all its commercial and civil intercour&s;e, mu&s;t put the whole of what power, authority, and influence is left, in any form what&s;oever it may a&s;&s;ume, into the hands of the managers and conductors of this circulation.</P>
<P>In England we feel the influence of the bank, though it is only the center of a voluntary dealing.

But if we take into con&s;ideration the other part e&s;&s;entially connected with it, (which con&s;i&s;ts in conti|nually drawing out for &s;ale portions of the confi&s;cated land, this continual exchanging land for paper, and this mixing it into cir|culation) we may conceive &s;omething of the inten&s;ity of its opera|tion. By this means, the &s;pirit of money-jobbing and &s;peculation goes into the ma&s;s of land it&s;elf, and incorporates with it. By this kind of operation, that &s;pecies of property becomes (as it were) volatized; it a&s;&s;umes an unnatural and mon&s;trous activity, and thereby throws into the hands of the &s;everal managers, prin|cipal and &s;ubordinate, Pari&s;ian and provincial, all the repre&s;enta|tive of money, and perhaps a full tenth part of all the land in France, which has now acquired the wor&s;t and mo&s;t pernicious part of the evil of a paper circulation, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible uncer|tainty in its value.

<P>Your legi&s;lators, in every thing new, are the very fir&s;t who have founded a commonwealth upon gaming, and infu&s;ed this &s;pirit into it as its vital breath. The great object in the&s;e politics is to metamorpho&s;e France, from a great kingdom into one great play|table; to turn its inhabitants into a nation of game&s;ters; to make &s;peculation as exten&s;ive as life; to mix it with all its concerns; and to divert the whole of the hopes and fears of the people from their u&s;ual channels, into the impul&s;es, pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;uper&s;titions of tho&s;e who live on chances. They loudly proclaim their opi|nion, that this their pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of a republic cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without this kind of gaming fund; and that the very thread of its life is &s;pun out of the &s;taple of the&s;e &s;peculations. The old gaming in funds was mi&s;chievous enough undoubtedly; but it was &s;o only to individuals. Even when it had its greate&s;t extent, in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and South Sea, it affected but few, comparatively; where it extends further, as in lotteries, the &s;pirit has but a &s;ingle object. But by bringing the currency of gaming into the minute&s;t matters, and engaging every body in it, and in every thing, a more dreadful epidemic di&s;temper of that kind is &s;pread than yet has appeared in the world. With you, a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner without a &s;peculation. What he receives in the morning, will not have the &s;ame value at night. What he is com|pelled to take as pay for an old debt, will not be received as the &s;ame when he is to contract a new one; nor will it be the &s;ame when, by prompt payment, he would avoid contracting any debt at all. Indu&s;try mu&s;t wither away. Oeconomy mu&s;t be driven from your country. Careful provi&s;ion will have no exi&s;tence. Who will labour without knowing the amount of his pay? Who will &s;tudy to increa&s;e what none can e&s;timate? Who will accu|mulate, when he does not know the value of what he &s;aves? If you ab&s;tract it from its u&s;es in gaming, to accumulate your paper wealth would be not the providence of a man, but the di&s;tempered in&s;tinct of a jackdaw.</P>
<P>The truly melancholy part of the policy of &s;y&s;tematically mak|ing a nation of game&s;ters is this; that tho' all are forced to play, few can under&s;tand the game; and fewer &s;till are in a condition to avail them&s;elves of the knowledge. The many mu&s;t be the dupes
<PB N="155" REF="023238_0157_0FBED7E1846A5B18">
of the few who conduct the machine of the&s;e &s;peculations. What effect it mu&s;t have on the country-people is vi&s;ible. When the pea&s;ant fir&s;t brings his corn to market, the magi&s;trate in the towns obliges him to take the a&s;&s;ignat at par; when he goes to the &s;hop with this money, he finds it &s;even per cent. the wor&s;e for cro&s;&s;ing the way. This market he will not readily re&s;ort to again. The town&s;man can calculate from day to day: not &s;o the inhabitant of the country. The towns-people will be inflamed! they will force the country-people to bring their corn. Re&s;i&s;tance will begin, and the murders of Paris and St. Dennis may be renewed through all France.</P>
<P>What &s;ignifies the empty compliments paid to the country by giving it perhaps more than its &s;hare in the theory of your repre|&s;entation? Where have you placed the real power over monied and landed circulation? Where have you placed the mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of rai&s;|ing and falling the value of every man's freehold? The whole of the power obtained by this revolution will &s;ettle in the towns among the burghers, and the monied directors who lead them. The landed gentleman, the yeoman, and the pea&s;ant have, none of them, habits, or inclinations, or experience, which can lead them to any &s;hare in this the &s;ole &s;ource of power and influence now left in France. The very nature of a country life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupations, and all the plea|&s;ures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the &s;ole way of procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impo&s;&s;ible among&s;t country-people. Combine them by all the art you can, and all the indu&s;try, they are always di&s;&s;olving into individuality. Any thing in the nature of incorporation is almo&s;t impracticable among&s;t them. Hope, fear, alarm, jealou&s;y, the ephemerous tale that does its bu&s;ine&s;s and dies in a day, all the&s;e things, which are the reins and &s;purs by which leaders check or urge the minds of followers, are not ea&s;ily employed, or hardly at all, among&s;t &s;cat|tered people. They a&s;&s;emble, they arm, they act with the utmo&s;t difficulty, and at the greate&s;t charge. Their efforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be &s;u&s;tained: They cannot proceed &s;y&s;tematically. If the country gentlemen attempt an influence through the mere income of their property, what is it to that of tho&s;e who have ten times their income to &s;ell, and who can ruin their property by bringing their plunder to meet it at market? If he wi&s;hes to mortgage, he falls the value of his land, and rai&s;es the value of a&s;&s;ignats. He augments the power of his enemy by the very means he mu&s;t take to contend with him. The country gen|tleman, therefore, the officer by &s;ea and land, the man of liberal views and habits, attached to no profe&s;&s;ion, will be as completely excluded from the government of his country as if he were legi|&s;latively p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;cribed. It is obvious, that in the towns, all the
<PB N="156" REF="023238_0158_0FBED7E2638DB710">
things which con&s;pire again&s;t the country gentlemen, combine in favour of the money manager and director. In towns combina|tion is natural. The habits of burghers, their occupations, their diver&s;ion, their bu&s;ine&s;s, their idlene&s;s, continually bring them into mutual contact. Their virtues and their vices are &s;ociable; they are always in garri&s;on; and they come embodied and half di&s;ciplined into the hands of tho&s;e who mean to form them for civil or for military action. Tho&s;e who&s;e operations can take from, or add ten per cent. to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of every man in France, mu&s;t be the ma&s;ters of every man in France.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations leave no doubt on my mind, that if this mon&s;ter of a con&s;titution can continue, France will be wholly go|verned by the agitators in corporations, by &s;ocieties in the towns formed of directors of a&s;&s;ignates, and tru&s;tees for the &s;ale of church l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds, attornies, agents, money-jobbers, &s;peculators, and adven|turers, compo&s;ing an ignoble oligarchy founded on the de&s;truction of the crown, the church, the nobility, and the people. Here end all the deceitful dreams and vi&s;ions of the equality and rights of men. In "the Serbonian bog" of this ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e oligarchy they are all ab&s;orbed, &s;unk, and lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>Though human eyes cannot trace them, one would be tempted to think &s;ome great offences in France mu&s;t cry to heaven, which has thought fit to puni&s;h it with a &s;ubjection to a vile and inglori|ous domination, in which no comfort or compen&s;ation is to be found in any, even of tho&s;e fal&s;e &s;plendours, which, playing about other tyrannies, prevent mankind from feeling them&s;elves di&s;ho|noured even whil&s;t they are oppre&s;&s;ed. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am touch|ed with a &s;orrow, mixed with &s;ome indignation, at the conduct of a few men, once of great rank, and &s;till of great character, who, deluded with &s;pecious names, have engaged in a bu&s;ine&s;s too deep for the line of their under&s;tanding to fathom; who have lent their fair reputation, and the authority of their high-&s;ounding names, to the de&s;igns of men with whom they could not be ac|quainted; and have thereby made their very virtues operate to the ruin of their country.</P>
<P>So far as to the fir&s;t cementing principle.</P>
<P>The &s;econd material of cement for their new republic is the &s;uperiority of the city of Paris; and this I admit is &s;trongly con|nected with the other cementing principle of paper circulation and confi&s;cation. It is in this part of the project we mu&s;t look for the cau&s;e of the de&s;truction of all the old bounds of provinces and ju|ri&s;dictions, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular, and the di&s;&s;olution of all an|cient combinations of things, as well as the formation of &s;o many &s;mall unconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is evidently one great &s;pring of all their politics. It is through the power of Paris, now become the center and focus of jobbing, that
<PB N="157" REF="023238_0159_0FBED7E3D9506478">
the leaders of this faction direct, or rather command the whole legi&s;lative and the whole executive government. Every thing therefore mu&s;t be done which can confirm the authority of that city over the other republics. Paris is compact; &s;he has an en|ormous &s;trength, wholly di&s;proportioned to the force of any of the &s;quare republics; and this &s;trength is collected and conden&s;ed within a narrow compa&s;s. Paris has a natural and ea&s;y connection of its parts, which will not be affected by any &s;cheme of a geo|metrical con&s;titution, nor does it much &s;ignify whether its propor|tion of repre&s;entation be more or le&s;s, &s;ince it has the whole draft of fi&s;hes in its dragnet. The other divi&s;ions of the kingdom be|ing hackled and torn to pieces, and &s;eparated from all their habi|tual means, and even principles of union, cannot, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, confederate again&s;t her. It was plain that the new in|corporation of the city of Paris could not completely and conclu|&s;ively domineer over France in any other way than by breaking, in every other part of it, tho&s;e connections which might balance her power. Nothing was therefore to be le&s;t in all the &s;ubordinate members, but weakne&s;s, di&s;connection, and confu&s;ion. To con|firm this part of the plan, the a&s;&s;embly has lately come to a re&s;o|lution, that no two of their republics &s;hall have the &s;ame comman|der in chief.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on who takes a view of the whole, the &s;trength of Paris thus formed, will appear a &s;y&s;tem of general weakne&s;s. It is boa&s;ted, that the geometrical policy has been adopted, that all local ideas &s;hould be &s;unk, and that the people &s;hould no longer be Ga&s;cons, Picards, Bretons, Normans, but Frenchmen, with one country, one heart, and one a&s;&s;embly. But in&s;tead of being all Frenchmen, the greater likelihood is, that the inhabitants of that region will &s;hortly have no country. No man ever was at|tached by a &s;en&s;e of pride, partiality, or real affection, to a de|&s;cription of &s;quare mea&s;urement. He never will glory in belong|ing to the Checquer, No. 71, or to any other badge-ticket. We begin our public affections in our families. No cold relation is a zealous citizen. We pa&s;s on to our neighbourhoods, and our ha|bitual provincial connections. The&s;e are inns and re&s;ting places. Such divi&s;ions of our country as have been formed by habit, and not by a &s;udden jerk of authority, were &s;o many little images of the great country in which the heart found &s;omething which it could fill. The love to the whole is not extingui&s;hed by this &s;ub|ordinate partiality. Perhaps it is a &s;ort of elemental training to tho&s;e higher and more large regards, by which alone men come to be affected, as with their own concern, in the pro&s;perity of a kingdom &s;o exten&s;ive as that of France. In that general territory it&s;elf, as in the old name of provinces, the citizens are intere&s;ted from old prejudices and unrea&s;oned habits, and not on account of
<PB N="158" REF="023238_0160_0FBED7E9A2B9CD10">
the geometric properties of its figure. The power and pre-emi|nence of Paris does certainly pre&s;s down and hold the&s;e republics together, as long as it la&s;ts. But, for the rea&s;ons I have already given you, I think it cannot la&s;t very long.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from the civil creating, and the civil cementing princi|ples of this con&s;titution, to the national a&s;&s;embly, which is to ap|pear and act as &s;overeign, we &s;ee a body in its con&s;titution with every po&s;&s;ible power, and no po&s;&s;ible external controul. We &s;ee a body without fundamental laws, without e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims, without re&s;pected rules of proceeding, which nothing can keep firm to any &s;y&s;tem what&s;oever. Their idea of their powers is al|ways taken at the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of legi&s;lative competency, and their examples for common ca&s;es, from the exceptions of the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity. The future is to be in mo&s;t re&s;pects like the pre|&s;ent a&s;&s;embly; but, by the mode of the new elections and the tendency of the new circulations, it will be purged of the &s;mall degree of internal controul exi&s;ting in a minority cho&s;en originally from various intere&s;ts, and pre&s;erving &s;omething of their &s;pirit. If po&s;&s;ible, the next a&s;&s;embly mu&s;t be wor&s;e than the pre&s;ent. The pre&s;ent, by de&s;troying and altering every thing, will leave to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors apparently nothing popular to do.

<P>Your all-&s;ufficient legi&s;lators, in their hurry to do every thing at once, have forgot one thing that &s;eems e&s;&s;ential, and which, I be|lieve, never has been, in the theory or the practice, omitted by any projector of a republic. They have forgot to con&s;titute a <HI>Senate,</HI> or &s;omething of that nature and character. Never, before this time, was heard of a body politic compo&s;ed of one legi&s;lative and active a&s;&s;embly, and its executive officers, without &s;uch a council; without &s;omething to which foreign &s;tates might connect them&s;elves; &s;omething to which, in the ordinary detail of govern|ment, the people could look up; &s;omething which might give a bias and &s;teadine&s;s, and pre&s;erve &s;omething like con&s;i&s;tency in the proceeding of &s;tate. Such a body kings generally have as a coun|cil. A monarchy may exi&s;t without it; but it &s;eems to be in the very e&s;&s;ence of a republican government. It holds a &s;ort of mid|dle place between the &s;upreme power exerci&s;ed by the people, or immediately delegated from them, and the mere executive. Of this there are no traces in your con&s;titution; and in providing nothing of this kind, your Solons and Numas have, as much as in any thing el&s;e, di&s;covered a &s;overeign incapacity.</P>
<P>Let us now turn our eyes to what they have done towards the formation of an executive power. For this they have cho&s;en a degraded king. This their fir&s;t executive officer is to be a ma|chine,
<PB N="159" REF="023238_0161_0FBED7EC77858040">
without any &s;ort of deliberative di&s;cretion in any one act of his function. At be&s;t, he is but a channel to convey to the national a&s;&s;embly &s;uch matter as may import that body to know. If he had been made the exclu&s;ive channel, the power would not have been without its importance; though infinitely perilous to tho&s;e who would choo&s;e to exerci&s;e it. But public intelligence and &s;tatement of facts may pa&s;s to the a&s;&s;embly, with equal authen|ticity, through any other conveyance. As to the means, there|fore, of giving a direction to mea&s;ures by the &s;tatement of an au|thorized reporter, this office of intelligence is as nothing.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider the French &s;cheme of an executive officer in its two natural divi&s;ions of civil and political&mdash;In the fir&s;t it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that, according to the new con&s;titution, the higher parts of judicature, in either of its lines, are not in the king. The king of France is not the fountain of ju&s;tice. The judges, nei|ther the original nor the appeilate, are of his nomination. He neither propo&s;es the candidates, nor has a negative on the choice. He is not even the public pro&s;ecutor. He &s;erves only as a nota|ry to authenticate the choice made of the judges in the &s;everal di&s;tricts. By his officers he is to execute their &s;entence. When we look into the true nature of his authority, he appears to be nothing more than a chief of bombailiffs, &s;erjeants at mace, catch|poles, jailers, and hangmen. It is impo&s;&s;ible to place any thing called royalty in a more degrading point of view. A thou&s;and times better it had been for the dignity of this unhappy prince, that he had nothing at all to do with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, deprived as he is of all that is venerable, and all that is con&s;olatory in that function, without power of originating any proce&s;s; with|out a power of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, mitigation, or pardon. Every thing in ju&s;tice that is vile and odious, is thrown upon him. It was not for nothing that the a&s;&s;embly has been at &s;uch pains to remove the &s;tigma from certain offices, when they were re&s;olved to place the per&s;on who lately had been their king, in a &s;ituation but one degree above the executioner, and in an office nearly of the &s;ame quality. It is not in nature, that &s;ituated as the king of the French now is, he can re&s;pect him&s;elf, or can be re&s;pected by others.</P>
<P>View this new executive officer on the &s;ide of his pulical ca|pacity, as he acts under the orders of the national a&s;&s;embly. To execute laws is a royal office; to execute orders is not to be a king. However, a political executive magi&s;tracy, though merely &s;uch, is a great tru&s;t. It is a tru&s;t indeed that has much depending upon its faithful and diligent performance, both in the per&s;on pre&s;iding in it and in all his &s;ubordinates. Means of performing this duty ought to be given by regulation; and di&s;|po&s;itions towards it ought to be infu&s;ed by the circum&s;tances at|tendant on the tru&s;t. It ought to be environed with dignity,
<PB N="160" REF="023238_0162_0FBED7EDA13F4AA0">
authority, and con&s;ideration, and it ought to lead to glory. The office of execution is an office of exertion. It is not from impotence we are to expect the ta&s;ks of power. What &s;ort of per&s;on is a king to command executory &s;ervice, who has no means what&s;oever to reward it? Not in a permanent office; not in a grant of land; no, not in a pen&s;ion of fifty pounds a year; not in the vaine&s;t and mo&s;t trivial title. In France the king is no more the fountain of honour than he is the fountain of ju&s;tice. All rewards, all di&s;tinctions are in other hands. Tho&s;e who &s;erve the king can be actuated by no natural motive but fear; by a fear of every thing except their ma&s;ter. His functions of internal coercion are as odious, as tho&s;e which he exerci&s;es in the department of ju&s;tice. If relief is to be given to any municipality, the a&s;&s;embly gives it. If troops are to be &s;ent to reduce them to obedience to the a&s;&s;embly, the king is to execute the order; and upon every occa&s;ion he is to be &s;pat|tered over with the blood of his people. He has no negative; yet his name and authority is u&s;ed to enforce every har&s;h de|cree. Nay, he mu&s;t concur in the butchery of tho&s;e who &s;hall attempt to free him from his impri&s;onment, or &s;hew the &s;lighte&s;t attachment to his per&s;on or to his antient authority.</P>
<P>Executive magi&s;tracy ought to be con&s;tituted in &s;uch a man|ner, that tho&s;e who compo&s;e it &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to love and to venerate tho&s;e whom they are bound to obey. A purpo&s;ed neglect, or, what is wor&s;e, a literal but perver&s;e and malig|nant obedience, mu&s;t be the ruin of the wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;els. In vain will the law attempt to anticipate or to follow &s;uch &s;tudied neglects and fraudulent attentions. To make men act zealou&s;ly is not in the competence of law. Kings, even &s;uch as are truly kings, may and ought to bear the freedom of &s;ubjects that are obnoxious to them. They may too, without derogating from them&s;elves, bear even the authority of &s;uch per&s;ons if it promotes their &s;ervice. Louis the XIIIth mortally hated the cardinal de Richlieu; but his &s;upport of that mini&s;ter again&s;t his rivals was the &s;ource of all the glory of his reign, and the &s;olid foundation of his throne it&s;elf. Louis the XIVth, when come to the throne, did not love the cardinal Mazarin; but for his intere&s;ts he pre&s;erved him in power. When old, he dete&s;ted Louvois; but for years, whil&s;t he faithfully &s;erved his great|ne&s;s, he endured his per&s;on. When George the IId took Mr. Pitt, who certainly was not agreeable to him, into his councils, he did nothing which could humble a wi&s;e &s;overeign. But the&s;e mini&s;ters, who were cho&s;en by affairs, not by affections, acted in the name of, and in tru&s;t for, kings; and not as their avowed, con&s;titutional, and o&s;ten&s;ible ma&s;ters. I think it im|po&s;&s;ible that any king, when he has recovered his fir&s;t terrors,
<PB N="161" REF="023238_0163_0FBED7EF193D97F8">
can cordially infu&s;e vivacity and vigour into mea&s;ures which he knows to be dictated by tho&s;e who he mu&s;t be pur&s;uaded are in the highe&s;t degree ill affected to his per&s;on. Will any mini|&s;ters, who &s;erve &s;uch a king (or whatever he may be called) with but a decent appearance of re&s;pect, cordially obey the orders of tho&s;e whom but the other day in his name they had committed to the Ba&s;tile? will they obey the orders of tho&s;e whom, whil&s;t they were exerci&s;ing de&s;potic ju&s;tice upon them, they conceived they were treating with lenity; and for whom, in a pri&s;on, they thought they had provided an a&s;ylum? If you expect &s;uch obedience, among&s;t your other innovations and regenerations, you ought to make a revolution in nature, and provide a new con&s;titution for the human mind. Otherwi&s;e, your &s;upreme government cannot harmonize with its executory &s;y&s;tem. There are ca&s;es in whch we cannot take up with names and ab&s;tractions. You may call half a dozen leading indivi|duals, whom we have rea&s;on to fear and hate, the nation. It makes no other difference, than to make us fear and hate them the more. If it had been thought ju&s;tifiable and expedient to make &s;uch a revolution by &s;uch means, and through &s;uch per|&s;ons, as you have made yours, it would have been more wi&s;e to have compleated the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fifth and &s;ixth of october. The new executive officer would then owe his &s;ituation to his real ma&s;ters; and he might be bound in intere&s;t, in the &s;ociety of crime, and (if in crimes there could be virtues) in gratitude, to &s;erve tho&s;e who had promoted him to a place of great lucre and great &s;en&s;ual indulgence; and of &s;omething more: For more he mu&s;t have received from tho&s;e who certainly would not have limitted an aggrandized creature, as they have done a &s;ubmitting antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>A king circum&s;tanced as the pre&s;ent, if he is totally &s;tupified by his misfortunes, &s;o as to think it not the nece&s;&s;ity, but the premium and privilege of life, to eat and &s;leep, without any regard to glory, never can be fit for the office. If he feels as men commonly feel, he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that an office &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced is one in which he can obtain no fame or reputation. He has no generous intere&s;t that can excite him to action. At be&s;t, his conduct will be pa&s;&s;ive and defen&s;ive. To inferior people &s;uch an office might be matter of honour. But to be rai&s;ed to it, and to de&s;cend to it, are different things, and &s;ugge&s;t different &s;entiments. Does he <HI>really</HI> name the mini&s;ters? They will have a &s;ympathy with him. Are they forced upon him? The whole bu&s;ine&s;s between them and the nominal king will be mutual counteraction. In all other countries, the office of mini&s;ters of &s;tate is of the highe&s;t dignity. In France it is full of peril and incapable of glory. Rivals however they will
<PB N="162" REF="023238_0164_0FBED7F17B220408">
have in their nothingne&s;s, whil&s;t &s;hallow ambition exi&s;ts in the world, or the de&s;ire of a mi&s;erable &s;alary is an incentive to &s;hort-&s;ighted avarice. Tho&s;e competitors of the mini&s;ters are enabled by your con&s;titution to attack them in their vital parts, whil&s;t they have not the means of repelling their charges in any other than the degrading character of culprits. The mini&s;ters of &s;tate in France are the only per&s;ons in that country who are incapable of a &s;hare in the national councils. What mini&s;ters! What councils! What a nation!&mdash;But they are re&s;pon&s;ible. It is a poor &s;ervice that is to be had from re&s;pon&s;ibility. The elevation of mind, to be derived from fear, will never make a nation glorious. Re&s;pon&s;ibility prevents crimes. It makes all attempts again&s;t the laws dangerous. But for a principle of active and zealous &s;ervice, none but idiots could think of it. Is the conduct of a war to be tru&s;ted to a man who may abhor its principle; who, in every &s;tep he may take to render it &s;ucce&s;sful, confirms the power of tho&s;e by whom he is oppre&s;&s;ed? Will foreign &s;tates &s;eriou&s;ly treat with him who has no preroga|tive of peace or war; no, not &s;o much as in a &s;ingle vote by him|&s;elf or his mini&s;ters, or by any one whom he can po&s;&s;ibly influ|ence. A &s;tate of contempt is not a &s;tate for a prince, better get rid of him at once.</P>
<P>I know it will be &s;aid, that the&s;e humours in the court and executive government will continue only through this generati|on; and that the king has been brought to declare the dauphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall be educated in a conformity to his &s;ituation. If he is made to conform to his &s;ituation, he will have no education at all. His training mu&s;t be wor&s;e even than that of an arbitrary monarch. If he reads,&mdash;whether he reads or not, &s;ome good or evil genius will tell him his ance&s;tors were kings. Thence-forward his object mu&s;t be to a&s;&s;ert him&s;elf, and to avenge his parents. This you will &s;ay is not his duty. That may be; but it is Nature; and whil&s;t you pique Nature again&s;t you, you do unwi&s;ely to tru&s;t to Duty. In this futile &s;cheme of polity, the &s;tate nur&s;es in its bo&s;om, for the pre&s;ent, a &s;ource of weak|ne&s;s, perplexity, counteraction, inefficiency, and decay; and it prepares the means of its final ruin. In &s;hort, I &s;ee nothing in the executive force (I cannot call it authority) that has even an appearance of vigour, or that has the &s;malle&s;t degree of ju&s;t corre&s;pondence or &s;ymmetry, or amicale relation, with the &s;upreme power, either as it now exi&s;ts, or as it is planned for the future government.</P>
<P>You have &s;ettled, by an oeconomy as perverted as the policy, two e&s;tabli&s;hments of government; one real, one fictitious. Both maintained at a va&s;t expence; but the fictitious at, I think, the greate&s;t. Such a machine as the latter is not worth the
<PB N="163" REF="023238_0165_0FBED7F3B2609758">
grea&s;e of its wheels. The expence is exhorbitant; and neither the &s;hew nor the u&s;e de&s;erve the tenth part of the charge. Oh! but I don't do ju&s;tice to the talents of the legi&s;lators. I don't allow, as I ought to do, for nece&s;&s;ity. Their &s;cheme of executive force was not their choice. This pageant mu&s;t be kept. The people would not con&s;ent to part with it. Right; I under&s;tand you. You do, in &s;pite of your grand theories, to which you would have heaven and earth to bend, you do know how to con|form your&s;elves to the nature and circum&s;tances of things. But when you were obliged to conform thus far to circum&s;tances, you ought to have carried your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion farther, and to have made what you were obliged to take, a proper in&s;trument, and u&s;eful to its end. That was in your power. For in&s;tance, among many others, it was in your power to leave to your king the right of peace and war. What! to leave to the executive ma|gi&s;trate the mo&s;t dangerous of all prerogatives? I know none more dangerous; nor any one more nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;o tru&s;ted. I do not &s;ay that this prerogative ought to be tru&s;ted to your king, unle&s;s he enjoyed other auxiliary tru&s;ts along with it, which he does not now hold. But, if he did po&s;&s;e&s;s them, ha|zardous as they are undoubtedly, advantages would ari&s;e from &s;uch con&s;titution, more than compen&s;ating the ri&s;que. There is no other way of keeping other potentates from intriguing di&s;tinctly and per&s;onally with the members of your a&s;&s;embly, from intermeddling in all your concerns, and &s;omenting, in the heart of your country, the mo&s;t pernicious of all factions; fac|tions in the intere&s;t and under the direction of foreign pow|ers. From that wor&s;t of evils, thank God, we are &s;till free. Your &s;kill, if you had any, would be well employed to find out indirect correctives and controls upon this perilous tru&s;t. If you did not like tho&s;e which in England we have cho&s;en, your leaders might have exerted their abilities in contriving better. If it were nece&s;&s;ary to exemplify the con&s;equences of &s;uch an execu|tive government as yours, in the management of great affairs, I &s;hould refer you to the late reports of M. de Montmorin to the national a&s;&s;embly, and all the other proceedings relative to the differences between Great-Britain and Spain. It would be treating your under&s;tanding with di&s;re&s;pect to point them out to you.</P>
<P>I hear that the per&s;ons who are called mini&s;ters have &s;ignified an intention of re&s;igning their places. I am rather a&s;toni&s;hed that they have not re&s;igned long &s;ince. For the univer&s;e I would not have &s;tood in the &s;ituation in which they have been for this la&s;t twelvemonth. They wi&s;hed well, I take it for granted, to the Revolution. Let this fact be as it may, they could not, placed as they were upon an eminence, though an
<PB N="164" REF="023238_0166_0FBED7FC32943E00">
eminence of humiliation, but be the fir&s;t to &s;ee collectively, and to feel &s;uch in his own department, the evils which have been produced by that revolution. In every &s;tep which they took, or forebore to take, they mu&s;t have felt the degraded &s;ituation of their country, and their utter incapacity of &s;erving it. They are in a &s;pecies of &s;ubordinate &s;ervitude, in which no men before them were ever &s;een. Without confidence from their &s;overeign, on whom they were forced, or from the a&s;&s;em|bly who forced them upon him, all the noble functions of their office are executed by committees of the a&s;&s;embly, without any regard what&s;oever to their per&s;onal, or their official authority. They are to execute, without power; they are to be re&s;pon&s;ible, without di&s;cretion; they are to deliberate, without choice. In their puzzled &s;ituation, under two &s;overeigns, over neither of whom they have any influence, they mu&s;t act in &s;uch a man|ner as (in effect, whatever they may intend) &s;ometimes to be|tray the one, &s;ometimes the other, and always to betray them|&s;elves. Such has been their &s;ituation; &s;uch mu&s;t be the &s;itua|tion of tho&s;e who &s;ucceed them. I have much re&s;pect, and many good wi&s;hes, for Mr. Necker. I am obliged to him for attentions. I thought when his enemies had driven him from Ver&s;ailles, that his exile was a &s;ubject of mo&s;t &s;erious congra|tulation&mdash;<HI>&s;ed multae urbes et publica vota vicerunt.</HI> He is now &s;itting on the ruins of the finances, and of the monarchy of France.</P>
<P>A great deal more might be ob&s;erved on the &s;trange con&s;ti|tution of the executory part of the new government; but fa|tigue mu&s;t give bounds to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects, which in them&s;elves have hardly any limits.</P>
<P>As little genius and talent am I able to perceive in the plan of judicature formed by the national a&s;&s;embly. According to their invariable cour&s;e, the framers of your con&s;titution have begun with the utter abolition of the parliaments. The&s;e ve|nerable bodies, like the re&s;t of the old government, &s;tood in need of reform, even though there &s;hould be no change made in the monarchy. They required &s;everal more alterations to adapt them to the &s;y&s;tem of a free con&s;titution. But they had particulars in their con&s;titution, and tho&s;e not a few, which de&s;erved approbation from the wi&s;e. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one fun|damental excellence; they were independent. The mo&s;t doubtful circum&s;tance attendant on their office, that of its be|ing vendible, contributed however to this independency of character. They held for life. Indeed they may be &s;aid to have held by inheritance. Appointed by the monarch, they were con&s;idered as nearly out of his power. The mo&s;t deter|mined exertions of that authority again&s;t them only &s;hewed
<PB N="165" REF="023238_0167_0FBED7FE2E4F9740">
their radical independence. They compo&s;ed permanent bo|dies politic, con&s;tituted to re&s;i&s;t arbitrary innovation; and from that corporate con&s;titution, and from mo&s;t of their forms, they were well calculated to afford both certainty and &s;tability to the laws. They had been a &s;afe a&s;ylum to &s;ecure the&s;e laws in all the revolutions of humour and opinion. They had &s;aved that &s;acred depo&s;it of the country during the reigns of arbitrary princes, and the &s;tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gles of arbitrary factions. They kept alive the memory and record of the con&s;titution. They were the great &s;ecurity to private property; which might be &s;aid (when per&s;onal liberty had no exi&s;tence) to be, in fact, as well guarded in France as in any other country. Whatever is &s;upreme in a &s;tate, ought to have, as much as po&s;&s;ible, its judicial authority &s;o con&s;tituted as not only not to depend upon it, but in &s;ome &s;ort to balance it. It ought to give a &s;ecurity to its ju&s;tice again&s;t its power. It ought to make its judicature, as it were, &s;omething exterior to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e parliaments had furni&s;hed, not the be&s;t certainly, but &s;ome con&s;iderable corrective to the exce&s;&s;es and vices of the monarchy. Such an independent judicature was ten times more nece&s;&s;ary when a democracy became the ab&s;olute power of the country. In that con&s;titution, elective, temporary, local judges, &s;uch as you have contrived, exerci&s;ing their de|pendent functions in a narrow &s;ociety, mu&s;t be the wor&s;t of all tribunals. In them it will be vain to look for any appearance of ju&s;tice towards &s;trangers, towards the obnoxious rich, to|wards the minority of routed parties, towards all tho&s;e who in the election have &s;upported un&s;ucce&s;sful candidates. It will be impo&s;&s;ible to keep the new tribunals clear of the wor&s;t &s;pirit of faction. All contrivances by ballot, we know experimentally, to be vain and childi&s;h to prevent a di&s;covery of inclinations. Where they may the be&s;t an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of concealment, they an&s;wer to produce &s;u&s;picion, and this is a &s;till more mi&s;|chievous cau&s;e of partiality.</P>
<P>If the parliaments had been pre&s;erved, in&s;tead of being di&s;&s;olved at &s;o ruinous a change to the nation, they might have &s;erved in this new commonwealth, perhaps not preci&s;ely the &s;ame (I do not mean an exact parallel) but near the &s;ame pur|po&s;es as the court and &s;enate of Areopagus did in Athens; that is, as one of the balances and correctives to the evils of a light and unju&s;t democracy. Every one knows, that this tri|bunal was the great &s;tay of that &s;tate; every one knows with what care it was upheld, and with what a religious awe it was con&s;ecrated. The parliaments were not wholly free from faction, I admit; but this evil was exterior and accidental, and not &s;o much the vice of their con&s;titution it&s;elf, as it mu&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="023238_0168_0FBED7FFB3D8CBF0">
be in your new contrivance of &s;exennial elective judicatories. Several Engli&s;h commend the abolition of the old tribunals, as &s;uppo&s;ing that they determined every thing by bribery and corruption. But they have &s;tood the te&s;t of monarchic and re|publican &s;crutiny. The court was well di&s;po&s;ed to prove cor|ruption on tho&s;e bodies when they were di&s;&s;olved in 1771 &mdash; Tho&s;e who have again di&s;&s;olved them would have done the &s;ame if they could&mdash;but both inqui&s;itions having failed, I conclude, that gro&s;s pecuniary corruption mu&s;t have been rather rare among&s;t them.</P>
<P>It would have been prudent, along with the parliaments, to pre&s;erve their antient power of regi&s;tering, and of remon&s;trating at lea&s;t, upon all the decrees of the national a&s;&s;embly, as they did upon tho&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed in the time of the monarchy. It would be a means of &s;quaring the occa&s;ional decrees of a demo|cracy to &s;ome principles of general juri&s;prudence. The ruin of the antient democracies was, that they ruled, as you do, by occa&s;ional decrees, <HI>p&s;ephi&s;m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta.</HI> This practice &s;oon broke in upon the tenour and con&s;i&s;tency of the laws; they abated the re&s;pect of the people towards them; and totally de&s;troyed them in the end.</P>
<P>Your ve&s;ting the power of remon&s;trance, which, in the time of the monarchy, exi&s;ted in the parliament of Paris, in your principal executive officer, whom in &s;pite of common &s;en&s;e, you per&s;evere in calling king, is the height of ab&s;urdity. You ought never to &s;uffer remon&s;trance from him who is to execute. This is to under&s;tand neither council nor execution; neither authority nor obedience. The per&s;on whom you call king, ought not to have this power, or he ought to have more.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent arrangement is &s;trictly judicial. In&s;tead of imi|tating your monarchy, and &s;eating your judges on a bench of independence, your object is to reduce them to the mo&s;t blind obedience. As you have changed all things, you have invented new principles of order.

the will of the people who locally choo&s;e tho&s;e judges, &s;uch con|fu&s;ion mu&s;t happen as is terrible to think of. For the judges owe their place to the local authority; and the commands they are &s;worn to obey come from tho&s;e who have no &s;hare in their appointment. In the mean time they have the example of the court of <HI>Chatelet</HI> to encourage and guide them in the exerci&s;e of their functions. That court is to try criminals &s;ent to it by the National A&s;&s;embly, or brought before it by other cour&s;es of delaction. They &s;it under a guard, to &s;ave their own lives. They know not by what law they judge, nor under what autho|rity they act, nor by what tenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e they hold. It is thought that they are &s;ometimes obliged to condemn at peril of their lives. This is not perhaps certain, nor can it be a&s;certained; but when they acquit, we know, they have &s;een the per&s;ons whom they di&s;charge, with perfect impunity to the actors, hanged at the door of their court.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly indeed promi&s;es that they will form a body of law, which &s;hall be &s;hort, &s;imple, clear, and &s;o forth. That is, by their &s;hort laws, they will leave much to the di&s;cretion of the judge; whil&s;t they have exploded the authority of all the learning which could make judicial di&s;cretion, (a thing peril|ous at be&s;t) de&s;erving the appellation of a <HI>&s;ound</HI> di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve, that the admini&s;trative bodies are carefully exempted from the juri&s;diction of the&s;e new tribunals. That is, tho&s;e per&s;ons are exempted from the power of the laws who ought to be the mo&s;t entirely &s;ubmitted to them. Tho&s;e who execute public pecuniary tru&s;ts, ought of all men to be the mo&s;t &s;trictly held to their duty. One would have thought, that it mu&s;t have been among your earlie&s;t cares, if you did not mean that tho&s;e admini&s;trative bodies &s;hould be real &s;ove|reign independent &s;tates, to form an awful tribunal, like your late parliaments, or like our king's-bench, where all corpo|rate officers might obtain protection in the legal exerci&s;e of their functions, and would find coercion if they tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t their legal duty. But the cau&s;e of the exemption is plain. The&s;e admini&s;trative bodies are the great in&s;truments of the pre&s;ent leaders in their progre&s;s through democracy to oligarchy. They mu&s;t therefore be put above the law. It will be &s;aid, that the legal tribunals which you have made are unfit to coerce them. They are undoubtedly. They are unfit for any rational purpo&s;e. It will be &s;aid too, that the admi|ni&s;trative bodies will be accountable to the general a&s;&s;embly. This I fear is talking, without much con&s;ideration, of the na|ture of that a&s;&s;embly or of the&s;e corporations. However, to be &s;ubject to the plea&s;ure of that a&s;&s;embly, is not to be &s;ubject to law, either for protection or for con&s;traint.</P>

His &s;tatement of facts, relative to the military of France, is important, not only from his official and per&s;onal authority, but becau&s;e it di&s;plays very clearly the actual condition of the army in France, and becau&s;e it throws light on the principles upon which the a&s;&s;embly proceeds in the admini&s;tration of this critical object.

Entire regiments have dared to violate at once the re&s;pect due to the laws, to the King, to the order e&s;tabli&s;hed by your decrees, and to the oaths which they have taken with the mo&s;t awful &s;olemnity. Compelled by my duty to give you information of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, my heart bleeds when I con&s;ider who they are that have com|mitted them. Tho&s;e, again&s;t whom it is not in my power to withhold the mo&s;t grievous complaints, are a part of that very &s;oldiery which to this day have been &s;o full of honour and loyalty, and with whom, for fifty years, I have lived the comrade and the friend.</Q></P>

To him the departure of the Troops from their antient principles of loyalty and honour &s;eems quite inconceivable. Surely tho&s;e to whom he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf know the cau&s;es of it but too well. They know the doctrines which they have preached, the decrees which they have pa&s;&s;ed, the practi&s;es which they have countenanced. The &s;oldiers remember the 6th of October. They recollect the French guards. They have not forgot the taking of the King's ca&s;tle in Paris, and at Mar&s;eilles. That they murdered with impunity, the gover|nors in both places, has not pa&s;&s;ed out of their minds. They do not abandon the principles laid down &s;o o&s;tentatiou&s;ly and laboriou&s;ly of the equality of men. They cannot &s;hut their eyes to the degradation of the whole noble&s;&s;e of France; and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the very idea of a gentleman. The total abolition of titles and di&s;tinctions is not lo&s;t upon them. But Mr. du Pin is a&s;toni&s;hed at their di&s;loyalty, when the doctors of the a&s;&s;embly have taught them at the &s;ame time the re&s;pect due to laws. It is ea&s;y to judge which of the two &s;orts of le&s;&s;ons men with arms in their hands are likely to learn. As to the authority of the King, we may recollect from the mini&s;ter him&s;elf (if any argument on that head were not quite &s;uper|fluous) that it is not of more con&s;ideration with the&s;e troops, than it is with every body el&s;e. "The King," &s;ays he, <Q>has over and over again repeated his orders to put a &s;top to the&s;e exce&s;&s;es: but, in &s;o terrible a cri&s;is <HI>your</HI> [the a&s;&s;embly's] concurrence is become indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the evils which menace the &s;tate. <HI>You</HI> unite to the force of the legi&s;lative power, <HI>that of opinion</HI> &s;till more important.</Q> To be &s;ure the army can have no opinion of the power or autho|rity of the king.

<P>It is now to be &s;een what has been propo&s;ed in this exigency, one of the greate&s;t that can happen in a &s;tate. The Mini&s;ter reque&s;ts the a&s;&s;embly to array it&s;elf in all its terrors, and to call forth all its maje&s;ty. He de&s;ires that the grave and &s;evere principles announced by them may give vigour to the King's proclamation. After this we &s;hould have looked for courts civil and martial; breaking of &s;ome corps, decimating others, and all the terrible means which nece&s;&s;ity has employed in &s;uch ca&s;es to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of the mo&s;t terrible of all evils; particularly, one might expect, that a &s;erious inquiry would be made into the murder of commandants in the view of their &s;oldiers.

After they had been told that the &s;oldiers trampled upon the decrees of the a&s;&s;embly promulgated by the King, the a&s;&s;embly pa&s;s new decrees; and they authori&s;e the King to make new proclamations. After the Secretary at War had &s;tated that the regiments had paid no regard to oaths <HI>pr&eacute;t&eacute;s avec la plus impo&s;ante &s;olemnit&eacute;,</HI> they propo&s;e&mdash;what?

I hope that handy abridgments of the excellent &s;ermons of Voltaire, d'Alembert, Diderot, and Helvetius, on the Immortality of the Soul, on a particular &s;uperintending Providence, and on a Future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, are &s;ent down to the &s;oldiers along with their civic oaths. Of this I have no doubt; as I under&s;tand, that a certain de&s;cription of reading makes no incon&s;iderable part of their military exerci&s;es, and that they are full as well &s;upplied with the ammunition of pamphlets as of cartridges.</P>

It is no le&s;s than this:&mdash;The King has promulgated in circular letters to all the regiments his direct authority and encouragement, that the &s;everal corps &s;hould join them&s;elves with the clubs and con&s;ederations in the &s;everal municipalities, and mix with them in their fea&s;ts and civic entertainments! This jolly di&s;cipline, it &s;eems, is to &s;often the ferocity of their minds; to reconcile them to their bottle companions of other de&s;criptions; and to merge particular con&s;piracies in more general a&s;&s;ociations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comme &s;a Maje&s;t&eacute; y a reconnu, non une &s;y&s;t&ecirc;me d'a&s;&s;ociations particu|li&egrave;res, mais une r&eacute;union de volont&eacute;s de rous les Francois pour la libert&eacute; et la pro&s;|perit&eacute; communes, ain&s;i pour le maintien de l'ordre publique; il a pen&s;&eacute; qu'il con|venoit que chaque regiment prit part a ces &s;&ecirc;tes civiques pour multiplier les rapp&ograve;rts, et re&s;errer les liens d'union entre les citoyens et les troupes.&mdash;Le&s;t I &s;hould not be credited, I in&s;ert the words, authori&s;ing the troops to fea&s;t with the popular confederacies.</NOTE>. That this remedy would be plea&s;ing to the &s;oldiers, as they are de&s;cribed by Mr. de la Tour du Pin, I can readily believe; and that, however mutinous otherwi&s;e, they will dutifully &s;ubmit them&s;elves to <HI>the&s;e</HI> royal proclamations. But I &s;hould que&s;tion whether all this civic &s;wearing, clubbing, and fea&s;ting, would di&s;po&s;e them more than at pre&s;ent they are di&s;po&s;ed, to an obedience to their officers; or teach them better to &s;ubmit to the au&s;tere rules of

military di&s;cipline. It will make them admirable citizens after the French mode, but not quite &s;o good &s;oldiers after any mode. A doubt might well ari&s;e, whether the conver&s;ations at the&s;e good tables, would fit them a great deal the better for the character of <HI>mere in&s;truments,</HI> which this veteran officer and &s;tate&s;man ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, the nature of things always requires an army to be.</P>
<P>Concerning the likelihood of this improvement in di&s;cipline, by the free conver&s;ation of the &s;oldiers with the municipal fe&s;|tive &s;ocieties, which is thus officially encouraged by royal au|thority and &s;anction, we may judge by the &s;tate of the munici|palities them&s;elves, furni&s;hed to us by the war mini&s;ter in this very &s;peech. He conceives good hopes of the &s;ucce&s;s of his en|deavours towards re&s;toring order <HI>for the pre&s;ent</HI> from the good di&s;po&s;ition of certain regiments; but he finds &s;omething cloudy with regard to the future. As to preventing the return of con|fu&s;ion <Q>for this, the admini&s;tration (&s;ays he) cannot be an|&s;werable to you, as long as they &s;ee the municipalities ar|rogate to them&s;elves an authority over the troops, which your in&s;titutions have re&s;erved wholly to the monarch. You have fixed the limits of the military authority and the municipal authority. You have bounded the action, which you have permitted to the latter over the former, to the right of requi|&s;ition; but never did the letter of the &s;pirit or your decrees authori&s;e the commons in the&s;e municipalities to break the officers to try them, to give orders to the &s;oldiers to drive them from the po&s;ts committed to their guard, to &s;top them in their marches ordered by the King, or, in a word, to en&s;lave the troops to the caprice of each of the cities or even market towns through which they are to pa&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the municiple &s;ociety which is to reclaim the &s;oldiery, to bring them back to the true principles of military &s;ubordination, and to render them ma|chines in the hands of the &s;upreme power of the country! Such are the di&s;tempers of the French troops! Such is their cure! As the army is, &s;o is the navy. The municipalities &s;upercede the orders of the a&s;&s;embly, and the &s;eamen in their turn &s;uper|&s;ede the orders of the municipalities. From my heart I pity the condition of a re&s;pectable &s;ervant of the public, like this war mini&s;ter, obliged in his old age to pledge the a&s;&s;embly in their civic cups and to enter with an hoary head into all the fanta&s;tick vagaries of the&s;e juvenile politicians.

But the municipalities affect a &s;overeignty, and will command tho&s;e troops which are nece&s;&s;ary for their protection. Indeed they mu&s;t command them or court them. The municipalities, by the nece&s;&s;ity of their &s;ituation, and by the republican powers they have obtain|ed, mu&s;t, with relation to the military, be the ma&s;ters, or the &s;ervants, or the confederates, or each &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; or they mu&s;t make a jumble of all together, according to circum&s;tances. What government is there to coerce the army but the munici|pality, or the municipality but the army? To pre&s;erve concord where authority is extingui&s;hed, at the hazard of all con&s;e|quences, the a&s;&s;embly attempts to cure the di&s;tempers by the di&s;tempers them&s;elves; and they hope to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from a purely military democracy, by giving it a debauched intere&s;t in the municipal.</P>

<P>What you may do finally, does not appear; nor is it of much moment, whil&s;t the &s;trange and contradictory relation between your army and all the Parts of your republic, as well as the puzzled relation of tho&s;e parts to each other and to the whole, remain as they are. You &s;eem to have given the provi&s;ional nomination of the officers, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the king, with a re&s;erve of approbation by the National A&s;&s;embly.

The officers mu&s;t therefore look to their intrigues in that a&s;&s;embly, as the &s;ole certain road to promotion. Still, however, by your new con&s;titution they mu&s;t begin their &s;olicitation at court. This double negociation for military rank &s;eems to me a contrivance as well adapted, as if it were &s;tudied for no other end, to pro|mote faction in the a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, relative to this va&s;t military patronage; and then to poi&s;on the corps of officers with factions of a nature &s;till more dangerous to the &s;afety of government,
<PB N="175" REF="023238_0177_0FBED81797BF9AE8">
upon any bottom upon which it can be placed, and de&s;tructive in the end to the efficiency of the army it&s;elf. Tho&s;e officers, who lo&s;e the promotions intended for them by the crown, mu&s;t become of a faction oppo&s;ite to that of the a&s;&s;embly which has rejected their claims, and mu&s;t nouri&s;h di&s;contents in the heart of the army again&s;t the ruling powers. Tho&s;e officers, on the other hand, who, by carrying their point through an intere&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly, feel them&s;elves to be at be&s;t only &s;econd in the good-will of the crown, though fir&s;t in that of the a&s;&s;embly, mu&s;t &s;light an authority that would not advance, and could not retard their promotion. If to avoid the&s;e evils you will have no other rule for command or promotion than &s;eniority, you will have an army of formality; at the &s;ame time it will become more independent, and more of a military republic. Not they but the king is the machine. A king is not to be depo&s;ed by halves. If he is not every thing in the command of an army, he is nothing. What is the effect of a power placed nominally at the head of the army, who to that army is no object of gratitude, or of fear? Such a cypher is not fit for the admini&s;tration of an object, of all things the mo&s;t deli|cate, the &s;upreme command of military men. They mu&s;t be con&s;trained (and their inclinations lead them to what their nece&s;&s;ities require) by a real, vigorous, effective, decided, per&s;onal authority. The authority of the a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf &s;uffers by pa&s;&s;ing through &s;uch a debilitating channel as they have cho&s;en. The army will not long look to an a&s;&s;embly acting through the organ of fal&s;e &s;hew, and palpable impo&s;ition. They will not &s;eriou&s;ly yield obedience to a pri&s;oner. They will either de&s;pi&s;e a pageant, or they will pity a captive king. This relation of your army to the crown will, if I am not greatly mi&s;taken, become a &s;erious dilemma in your politics.</P>
<P>It is be&s;ides to be con&s;idered, whether an a&s;&s;embly like yours, even &s;uppo&s;ing that it was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another &s;ort of organ through which its orders were to pa&s;s, is fit for promoting the obedience and di&s;cipline of an army. It is known, that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedi|ence to any &s;enate, or popular authority; and they will lea&s;t of all yield it to an a&s;&s;embly which is to have only a continu|ance of two years. The officers mu&s;t totally lo&s;e the character|i&s;tic di&s;po&s;ition of military men, if they &s;ee with perfect &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and due admiration, the dominion of pleaders; e&s;peci|ally when they find, that they have a new court to pay to an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e pleaders, who&s;e military policy, and the genius of who&s;e command (if they &s;hould have any) mu&s;t be as uncertain as their duration is tran&s;ient. In the weakne&s;s of one kind of authority, and in the fluctuation of all, the offi|cers
<PB N="176" REF="023238_0178_0FBED8191B5EE5A0">
of an army will remain for &s;ome time mutinous and full of faction, until &s;ome popular general, who under&s;tands the art of conciliating the &s;oldiery, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the true &s;pirit of command, &s;hall draw the eyes of all men upon him&s;elf. Armies will obey him on his per&s;onal account. There is no other way of &s;ecuring military obedience in this &s;tate of things. But the moment in which that event &s;hall happen, the per&s;on who really commands the army is your ma&s;ter; the ma&s;ter (that is little) of your king, the ma&s;ter of your a&s;&s;embly, the ma&s;ter of your whole republic.</P>
<P>How came the a&s;&s;embly by their pre&s;ent power over the ar|my? Chiefly, to be &s;ure, by debauching the &s;oldiers from their officers. They have begun by a mo&s;t terrible operation. They have touched the central point, about which the particles that compo&s;e armies are at repo&s;e. They have de&s;troyed the prin|ciple of obedience in the great e&s;&s;ential critical link between the officer and the &s;oldier, ju&s;t where the chain of military &s;u|bordination commences, and on which the whole of that &s;y&s;tem depends. The &s;oldier is told, he is a citizen, and has the rights of man and citizen. The right of a man, he is told, is to be his own governor, and to be ruled only by tho&s;e to whom he delegates that &s;elf-government. It is very natural he &s;hould think, that he ought mo&s;t of all to have his choice where he is to yield the greate&s;t degree of obedience. He will therefore, in all probability, &s;y&s;tematically do, what he does at pre&s;ent occa&s;ionally; that is, he will exerci&s;e at lea&s;t a negative in the choice of his officers. At pre&s;ent the officers are known at be&s;t to be only permi&s;&s;ive, and on their good behaviour. In fact, there have been many in&s;tances in which they have been ca&s;h|iered by their corps. Here is a &s;econd negative on the choice of the king; a negative as effectual at lea&s;t as the other of the a&s;&s;embly. The &s;oldiers know already that it has been a que&s;ti|on, not ill received in the national a&s;&s;embly, whether they ought not to have the direct choice of their officers, or &s;ome proportion of them? When &s;uch matters are in deliberation, it is no extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition that they will incline to the opinion mo&s;t favourable to their preten&s;ions. They will not bear to be deemed the army of an impri&s;oned king, whil&s;t ano|ther army in the &s;ame country, with whom too they are to fea&s;t and confederate, is to be con&s;idered as the free army of a free con&s;titution. They will ca&s;t their eyes on the other and more permanent army; I mean the municipal. That corps, they well know, does actually elect its own officers. They may not be able to di&s;cern the grounds of di&s;tinction on which they are not to elect a Marquis de la Fayette (or what is his new name) of their own? If this election of a commander in chief
<PB N="177" REF="023238_0179_0FBED81AA27F38F8">
be a part of the rights of men, why not of theirs? They &s;ee elective ju&s;tices of peace, elective judges, elective curates, elective bi&s;hops, elective municipalities, and elective com|manders of the Pari&s;ian army.&mdash;Why &s;hould they alone be ex|cluded? Are the brave troops of France the only men in that nation who are not the fit judges of military merit, and of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for a commander in chief? Are they paid by the &s;tate, and do they therefore lo&s;e the rights of men? They are a part of that nation them&s;elves, and contribute to that pay. And is not the king, is not the national a&s;&s;embly, and are not all who elect the national a&s;&s;embly, likewi&s;e paid? In&s;tead of &s;eeing all the&s;e forfeit their rights by their receiving a &s;alary, they perceive that in all the&s;e ca&s;es a &s;alary is given for the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rights. All your re&s;o|lutions, all your proceedings, all your debates, all the works of your doctors in religion and politics, have indu&s;triou&s;ly been put into their hands; and you expect that they will apply to their own ca&s;e ju&s;t as much of your doctrines and examples as &s;uits your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Every thing depends upon the army in &s;uch a government as yours; for you have indu&s;triou&s;ly de&s;troyed all the opinions, and prejudices, and, as far as in you lay, all the in&s;tincts which &s;upport government. Therefore the moment any difference ari&s;es between your national a&s;&s;embly and any part of the nation, you mu&s;t have recour&s;e to force. Nothing el&s;e is left to you; or rather you have left nothing el&s;e to your&s;elves. You &s;ee by the report of your war mini&s;ter, that the di&s;tribution of the army is in a great mea&s;ure made with a view of internal coercion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Courier Francois, 30 July, 1790. A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e Nationale, Numero 210.</NOTE>. You mu&s;t rule by an army; and you have infu&s;ed into that army by which you rule, as well as into the whole body of the nation, principles which after a time mu&s;t di&s;able you in the u&s;e you re&s;olve to make of it. The king is to call out troops to act again&s;t his people, when the world has been told, and the a&s;&s;ertion is &s;till ringing in our ears, that troops ought not to &s;ire on citizens. The colonies a&s;&s;ert to them&s;elves to an independent con&s;titution and a free trade. They mu&s;t be con&s;trained by troops. In what chapter of your code of the rights of men, are they able to read, that it is a part of the rights of men to have their commerce monopolized and re&s;trained for the benefit of others. As the coloni&s;ts ri&s;e on you, the negroes ri&s;e on them. Troops again&mdash;Ma&s;&s;acre, torture, hang|ing! The&s;e are your rights of men! The&s;e are the fruits of metaphi&s;ic declarations wantonly made, and &s;hamefully retract|ed! It was but the other day that the farmers of land in one of your provinces refu&s;ed to pay &s;ome &s;orts of rents to the lord of the &s;oil. In con&s;equence of this you decree, that the country
<PB N="178" REF="023238_0180_0FBED81C15CD0E00">
people &s;hall pay all rents and dues, except tho&s;e which as griev|ances you have aboli&s;hed; and if they refu&s;e, then you order the king to march troops again&s;t them. You lay down meta|phy&s;ic propo&s;itions which infer univer&s;al con&s;equences, and then you attempt to limit logic by de&s;poti&s;m. The leaders of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem tell them of their rights, as men, to take for|tre&s;&s;es, to murder guards, to &s;eize on kings without the lea&s;t appearance of authority even from the a&s;&s;embly, whil&s;t, as the &s;overeign legi&s;lative body, that a&s;&s;embly was &s;itting in the name of the nation&mdash;and yet the&s;e leaders pre&s;ume to order out the troops, which have acted in the&s;e very di&s;orders, to coerce tho&s;e who &s;hall judge on the principles, and follow the examples, which have been guarantied by their own approbation.</P>
<P>The leaders teach the people to abhor and reject all feodality as the barbari&s;m of tyranny, and they tell them afterwards how much of that barbarous tyranny they are to bear with patience. As they are prodigal of light with regard to grievances, &s;o the people find them &s;paring in the extreme with regard to redre&s;s. They know that not only certain quit-rents and per&s;onal duties, which you have permitted them to redeem (but have furni&s;hed no money for the redemption) are as nothing to tho&s;e burthens for which you have made no provi&s;ion at all. They know, that almo&s;t the whole &s;y&s;tem of landed property in its origin is fendal; that it is the di&s;tribution of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the original proprietors, made by a barbarous conqueror to his barbarous in&s;truments; and that the mo&s;t grievous effects of the conque&s;t are the land rents of every kind, as without que&s;tion they are.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants, in all probability, are the de&s;cendants of the&s;e anti|ent proprietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail, in any degree, in the titles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and lawyers, they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that men are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought not to be monopolized to fo&s;ter the pride and luxury of any men, who by nature are no better than them&s;elves, and who, if they do not labour for their bread, are wor&s;e. They find, that by the laws of nature the occupant and &s;ubduer of the &s;oil is the true proprietor; that there is no pre&s;cription again&s;t na|ture; and that the agreements (where any there are) which have been made with their landlords, during the time of &s;lavery, are only the effect of dure&s;&s;e and force; and that when the people re-entered into the rights of men, tho&s;e agreements were made as void as every thing el&s;e which had been &s;ettled under the prevalence of the old feudal and ari&s;tocratic tyranny. They will tell you that they &s;ee no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade, and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet. If you ground the title to rents on &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and pre&s;cription, they tell you, from
<PB N="179" REF="023238_0181_0FBED81DC425C098">
the &s;peech of Mr. <HI>Camus,</HI> publi&s;hed by the national a&s;&s;embly for their information, that things ill begun cannot avail them&s;elves of pre&s;cription; that the title of the&s;e lords was vicious in its origin; and that force is at lea&s;t as bad as fraud. As to the title by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, they will tell you, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who have cul|tivated the &s;oil is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments and &s;illy &s;ub&s;titutions; that the lords have enjoyed their u&s;urpation too long; and that if they allow to the&s;e lay monks any charitable pen&s;ion, they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor, who is &s;o generous towards a fal&s;e claimant to his goods.</P>
<P>When the pea&s;ants give you back that coin of &s;ophi&s;tic rea&s;on, on which you have &s;et your image and &s;uper&s;cription, you cry it down as ba&s;e money, and tell them you will pay for the future with French guards, and dragoons, and hu&s;&s;ars. You hold up, to cha&s;ti&s;e them, the &s;econd-hand authority of a king, who is only the in&s;trument of de&s;troying, without any power of protecting either the people or his own per&s;on. Through him it &s;eems you will make your&s;elves obeyed. They an&s;wer, You have taught us that there are no gentlemen; and which of your principles teach us to bow to kings whom we have not elected? We know, with|out your teaching, that lands were given for the &s;upport of feudal dignities, feudal titles, and feudal offices. When you took down the cau&s;e as a grievance, why &s;hould the more grievous effect re|main? As there are now no hereditary honours, and no di&s;tin|gui&s;hed families, why are we taxed to maintain what you tell us ought not to exi&s;t? You have &s;ent down our old ari&s;tocratic land|lords in no other character, and with no other title, but that of exactors under your authority. Have you endeavoured to make the&s;e your rent-gatherers re&s;pectable to us? No: You have &s;ent them to us with their arms rever&s;ed, their &s;hields broken, their impre&s;&s;es defaced; and &s;o di&s;plumed, degraded, and metamor|pho&s;ed, &s;uch unfeathered two-legged things, that we no longer know them. They are &s;trangers to us. They do not even go by the names of our antient lords. Phy&s;ically they may be the &s;ame men; though we are not quite &s;ure of that, on your new philo|&s;ophic doctrines of per&s;onal identity. In all other re&s;pects they are totally changed. We do not &s;ee why we have not as good a right to refu&s;e them their rents, as you have to abrogate all their honours, titles, and di&s;tinctions. This we have never commi&s;|&s;ioned you to do; and it is one in&s;tance, among many indeed, of your a&s;&s;umption of undelegated power. We &s;ee the burghers of Paris, through their clubs, their mobs, and their national guards, directing you at their plea&s;ure, and giving that as law to you, which, under your authority, is tran&s;mitted as law to us. Thro' you, the&s;e burghers di&s;po&s;e of the lives and fortunes of us all.
<PB N="180" REF="023238_0182_0FBED8280C0A65C0">
Why &s;hould not you attend as much to the de&s;ires of the laborious hu&s;bandman with regard to our rent, by which we are affected in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner, as you do to the demands of the&s;e in|&s;olent burghers, relative to di&s;tinctions and titles of honour, by which neither they nor we are affected at all? But we find you pay more regard to their fancies than to our nece&s;&s;ities. Is it among the rights of man to pay tribute to his equals? Before this mea&s;ure of yours, we might have thought we were not perfectly equal. We might have entertained &s;ome old, habitual, unmean|ing prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of tho&s;e landlords; but we cannot con|ceive with what other view than that of de&s;troying all re&s;pect to them, you could have made the law that degrades them. You have forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of re&s;pect, and now you &s;end troops to &s;abre and to bayonet us into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to fear and force, which you did not &s;uffer us to yield to the mild authority of opinion.</P>
<P>The ground of &s;ome of the&s;e arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all rational ears; but to the politicians of metaphy&s;ics who have opened &s;chools for &s;ophi&s;try, and made e&s;tabli&s;hments for anarchy, it is &s;olid and conclu&s;ive. It is obvious, that on a mere con&s;idera|tion of the right, the leaders in the a&s;&s;embly would not in the lea&s;t have &s;crupled to abrogate the rents along with the titles and family en&s;igns. It would be only to follow up the principle of their rea|&s;onings, and to complete the analogy of their conduct. But they had newly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a great body of landed property by confi&s;cation. They had this commodity at market; and the market would have been wholly de&s;troyed, if they were to permit the hu&s;bandmen to riot in the &s;peculations with which they &s;o freely intoxicated them&s;elves. The only &s;ecurity which property enjoys in any one of its de&s;criptions, is from the intere&s;ts of their rapacity with regard to &s;ome other. They have left nothing but their own arbitrary plea&s;ure to determine what property is to be protected and what &s;ubverted. Neither have they left any prin|ciple by which any of their municipalities can be bound to obe|dience; or even con&s;cientiou&s;ly obliged not to &s;eparate from the whole, to become independent, or to connect it&s;elf with &s;ome other &s;tate. The people of Lyons, it &s;eems, have refu&s;ed lately to pay taxes. Why &s;hould they not? What lawful authority is there le&s;t to exact them? The king impo&s;ed &s;ome of them. The old &s;tates, methodi&s;ed by orders, &s;ettled the more antient. They may &s;ay to the a&s;&s;embly, Who are you, that are not our kings, nor the &s;tates we have elected, nor &s;it on the principles on which we have elected you? And who are we, that when we &s;ee the ga|belles which you have ordered to be paid, wholly &s;haken off&mdash; when we &s;ee the act of di&s;obedience afterwards ratified by your|&s;elves, who are we, that we are not to judge what taxes we ought
<PB N="181" REF="023238_0183_0FBED8294581D5F8">
or ought not to pay, and who are not to avail our&s;elves of the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e powers, the validity of which you have approved in others? To this the an&s;wer is, We will &s;end troops. The la&s;t rea&s;on of kings, is always the fir&s;t with your a&s;&s;embly. This military aid may &s;erve for a time, whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of the increa&s;e of pay remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all di&s;putes is flattered. But this weapon will &s;nap &s;hort, unfaithful to the hand that employs it. The a&s;&s;embly keep a &s;chool where, &s;y&s;tematically, and with unremitting per&s;everance, they teach principles, and form regu|lations de&s;tructive to all &s;pirit of &s;ubordination, civil and military&mdash; and then they expect that they &s;hall hold in obedience an anar|chic people by an anarchic army.</P>
<P>The municipal army, which, according to their new policy, is to balance this national army, if con&s;idered in it&s;elf only, is of a con&s;titution much more &s;imple, and in every re&s;pect le&s;s exception|able. It is a mere democratic body, unconnected with the crown or the kingdom; armed, and trained, and officered at the plea&s;ure of the di&s;tricts to which the corps &s;everally belong; and the per|&s;onal &s;ervice of the individuals who compo&s;e, or the fine in lieu of per&s;onal &s;ervice, are directed by the &s;ame authority. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ee by Mr. Necker's account, that the national guards of Paris have received, over and above the money levied within their own city, about 145,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling out of the public trea&s;ure. Whether this be an actual payment for the nine months of their exi&s;tence, or an e&s;timate of their yearly charge, I do not clearly perceive. It is of no great importance, as certainly they may take whatever they plea&s;e.</NOTE> Nothing is more uniform. If, however, con&s;idered in any relation to the crown, to the national a&s;&s;embly, to the public tribunals, or to the other army, or con&s;idered in a view to any coherence or connection between its parts, it &s;eems a mon&s;ter, and can hardly fail to termi|nate its perplexed movements in &s;ome great national calamity. It is a wor&s;e pre&s;ervative of a general con&s;titution, than the &s;y&s;ta&s;is of Crete, or the confederation of Poland, or any other ill-devi&s;ed corrective which has yet been imagined, in the nece&s;&s;ities produced by an ill-con&s;tructed &s;y&s;tem of government.</P>
<P>Having concluded my few remarks on the con&s;titution of the &s;upreme power, the executive, the judicature, the military, and on the reciprocal relation of all the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething of the ability &s;hewed by your legi&s;lators with regard to the revenue.</P>
<P>In their proceedings relative to this object, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till fewer traces appear of political judgment or financial re&s;ource. When the &s;tates met, it &s;eemed to be the great object to improve the &s;y&s;tem of revenue, to enlarge its collection, to clean&s;e it of oppre&s;&s;ion and vexation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h it on the mo&s;t &s;olid foot|ing. Great were the expectations entertained on that head through|out Europe. It was by this grand arrangement that France was
<PB N="182" REF="023238_0184_0FBED82A5F246980">
to &s;tand or fall; and this became, in my opinion, very properly, the te&s;t by which the &s;kill and patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e who ruled in that a&s;&s;embly would be tried. The revenue of the &s;tate is the &s;tate. In effect all depends upon it, whether for &s;upport or for reformation. The dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it. As all great quantities of the mind which operate in public, and are not merely &s;uffering and pa&s;&s;ive, require force for their di&s;play, I had almo&s;t &s;aid for their unequivocal exi&s;tence, the re|venue, which is the &s;pring of all power, becomes in its admini&s;|tration the &s;phere of every active virtue. Public virtue, being of a nature magnificent and &s;plendid, in&s;tituted for great things, and conver&s;ant about great concerns, requires abundant &s;cope and room, and cannot &s;pread and grow under confinement, and in cir|cum&s;tances &s;traitened, narrow, and &s;ordid. Through the revenue alone the body politic can act in its true genius and character, and therefore it will di&s;play ju&s;t as much of its collective virtue, and as much of that virtue which may characteri&s;e tho&s;e who move it, and are, as it were, its life and guiding principle, as it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ju&s;t revenue. For from hence, not only magnanimity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and providence, and the tutelary protection of all good arts, derive their food, and the growth of their organs, but continence, and &s;elf-denial, and la|bour, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever el&s;e there is in which the mind &s;hews it&s;elf above the appetite, are no where more in their proper element than in the provi&s;ion and di&s;tribution of the public wealth. It is therefore not without rea&s;on that the &s;cience of &s;peculative and practical finance, which mu&s;t take to its aid &s;o many auxiliary branches of knowledge, &s;tands high in the e&s;timation not only of the ordinary &s;ort, but of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men; and as this &s;cience has grown with the progre&s;s of its ob|ject, the pro&s;perity and improvement of nations has generally en|crea&s;ed with the encrea&s;e of their revenues; and they will both continue to grow and flouri&s;h, as long as the balance between what is left to &s;trengthen the efforts of individuals, and what is collect|ed for the common efforts of the &s;tate, bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion, and are kept in a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence and communication. And perhaps it may be owing to the greatne&s;s of revenues, and to the urgency of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ities, that old abu&s;es in the con&s;titution of finances are di&s;covered, and their true nature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly under&s;tood; in&s;o|much, that a &s;maller revenue might have been more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in one period than a far greater is &s;ound to be in another; the propor|tionate wealth even remaining the &s;ame. In this &s;tate of things, the French a&s;&s;embly found &s;omething in their revenues to pre&s;erve, to &s;ecure, and wi&s;ely to admini&s;ter, as well as to abrogate and

alter. Though their proud a&s;&s;umption might ju&s;tify the &s;evere&s;t te&s;ts, yet in trying their abilities on their financial proceedings, I would only con&s;ider what is the plain obvious duty of a common finance mini&s;ter, and try them upon that, and not upon models of ideal perfection.</P>
<P>The objects of a financier are, then, to &s;ecure an ample revenue; to impo&s;e it with judgment and equality; to employ it oeconomi|cally; and when nece&s;&s;ity obliges him to make u&s;e of credit, to &s;ecure its foundations in that in&s;tance, and for ever, by the clear|ne&s;s and candour of his proceedings, the exactne&s;s of his calcu|lations, and the &s;olidity of his funds. On the&s;e heads we may take a &s;hort and di&s;tinct view of the merits and abilities of tho&s;e in the national a&s;&s;embly, who have taken to them&s;elves the manage|ment of this arduous concern. Far from any encrea&s;e of revenue in their hands, I find, by a report of M. Vernier, from the com|mittee of finances, of the &s;econd of Augu&s;t la&s;t, that the amount of the national revenue, as compared with its produce before the revolution, was dimini&s;hed by the &s;um of two hundred millions, or <HI>eight millions &s;terling</HI> of the annual income, con&s;iderably more than one-third of the whole!</P>
<P>If this be the re&s;ult of great ability, never &s;urely was ability di&s;played in a more di&s;tingui&s;hed manner, or with &s;o powerful an effect. No common folly, no vulgar incapacity, no ordinary official negligence, even no official crime, no corruption, no pecu|lation, hardly any direct ho&s;tility which we have &s;een in the mo|dern world, could in &s;o &s;hort a time have made &s;o complete an overthrow of the finances, and with them, of the &s;trength of a great kingdom.&mdash;<HI>Caed&ograve; qui ve&s;tram rempublican tantam ami&s;i&s;tis tam cito?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ophi&s;ters and declaimers, as &s;oon as the a&s;&s;embly met, be|gan with decrying the antient con&s;titution of the revenue in many of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches, &s;uch as the public monopoly of &s;alt. They charged it, as truly as unwi&s;ely, with being ill-contrived, oppre&s;&s;ive, and partial. This repre&s;entation they were not &s;atis|fied to make u&s;e of in &s;peeches preliminary to &s;ome plan of re|form; they declared it in a &s;olemn re&s;olution or public &s;entence, as it were judicially, pa&s;&s;ed upon it; and this they di&s;per&s;ed throughout the nation. At the time they pa&s;&s;ed the decree, with the &s;ame gravity they ordered this &s;ame ab&s;urd, oppre&s;&s;ive, and partial tax to be paid, until they could find a revenue to replace it. The con&s;equence was inevitable. The provinces which had been always exempted from this &s;alt monopoly, &s;ome of whom were charged with other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally di&s;inclined to bear any part of the burthen, which, by an equal di&s;tribution, was to redeem the others. As to the a&s;&s;embly, occu|pied as it was with the declaration and violation of the rights of
<PB N="184" REF="023238_0186_0FBED82D5E980FD0">
men, and with their arrangements for general confu&s;ion, it had neither lei&s;ure nor capacity to contrive, nor authority to enforce any plan of any kind relative to the replacing the tax or equalizing it, or compen&s;ating the provinces, or for conducting their minds to any &s;cheme of accommodation with the other di&s;tricts which were to be relieved.</P>
<P>The people of the &s;alt provinces, impatient under taxes damned by the authority which had directed their payment, very &s;oon found their patience exhau&s;ted. They thought them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;kil|ful in demoli&s;hing as the a&s;&s;embly could be. They relieved them|&s;elves by throwing off the whole burthen. Animated by this ex|ample, each di&s;trict, or part of a di&s;trict, judging of its own griev|ance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own opinion, did as it plea&s;ed with other taxes.</P>
<P>We are next to &s;ee how they have conducted them&s;elves in con|triving equal impo&s;itions, proportioned to the means of the citi|zens, and the lea&s;t likely to lean heavy on the active capital em|ployed in the generation of that private wealth, from whence the public fortune mu&s;t be derived. By &s;uffering the &s;everal di&s;tricts, and &s;everal of the individuals in each di&s;trict, to judge of what part of the old revenue they might withhold, in&s;tead of better principles of equality, a new inequality was introduced of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive kind. Payments were regulated by di&s;po&s;itions. The parts of the kingdom which were the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, the mo&s;t orderly, or the mo&s;t affectionate to the commonwealth, bore the whole burthen of the &s;tate. Nothing turns out to be &s;o oppre&s;|&s;ive and unju&s;t as a feeble government. To fill up all the deficien|cies in the old impo&s;itions, and the new deficiencies of every kind which were to be expected, what remained to a &s;tate without au|thority? The national a&s;&s;embly called for a voluntary benevo|lence; for a fourth part of the income of all the citizens, to be e&s;timated on the honour of tho&s;e who were to pay. They obtained &s;omething more than could be rationally calculated, but what was, far indeed, from an&s;werable to their real nece&s;&s;ities, and much le&s;s to their fond expectations. Rational people could have hoped for little from this their tax in the di&s;gui&s;e of a benevolence; a tax, weak, ineffective, and unequal; a tax, by which luxury, avarice, and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, were &s;creened, and the load thrown upon produc|tive capital, upon integrity, genero&s;ity, and public &s;pirit&mdash;a tax of regulation upon virtue. At length the ma&s;k is thrown off, and they are now trying means (with little &s;ucce&s;s) of exacting their benevolence by force.</P>
<P>This benevolence, the ricketty offspring of weakne&s;s, was to be &s;upported by another re&s;ource, the twin brother of the &s;ame pro|lific imbecility. The patriotic donations were to make good the failure of the patriotic contribution. John Doe was to become

&s;ecurity for Richard Roe. By this &s;cheme they took things of much price from the giver, comparatively of &s;mall value to the receiver; they ruined &s;everal trades; they pillaged the crown of its ornaments, the churches of their plate, and the people of their per&s;onal decorations. The invention of the&s;e juvenile pretenders to liberty, was in reality nothing more than a &s;ervile imitation of one of the poore&s;t re&s;ources of doting de&s;poti&s;m. They took an old huge full-bottomed perriwig out of the wardrobe of the anti|quated frippery of Louis XIV. to cover the premature baldne&s;s of the national a&s;&s;embly. They produced this old-fa&s;hioned formal folly, though it had been &s;o abundantly expo&s;ed in the Memoirs of the Duke de St Simon, if to rea&s;onable men it had wanted any arguments to di&s;play its mi&s;chief and in&s;ufficiency. A device of the &s;ame kind was tried in my memory by Louis XV. but it an|&s;wered at no time. However, the nece&s;&s;ities of ruinous wars were &s;ome excu&s;e for de&s;perate projects. The deliberations of calamity are rarely wi&s;e. But here was a &s;ea&s;on for di&s;po&s;ition and provi|dence. It was in a time of profound peace, then enjoyed for five years, and promi&s;ing a much longer continuance, that they had recour&s;e to this de&s;perate trifling. They were &s;ure to lo&s;e more reputation by &s;porting, in their &s;erious &s;ituation, with the&s;e toys and play things of finance, which have filled half their journals, than could po&s;&s;ibly be compen&s;ated by the poor temporary &s;upply which they afforded. It &s;eemed as if tho&s;e who adopted &s;uch projects were wholly ignorant of their circum&s;tances, or wholly unequal to their nece&s;&s;ities. Whatever virtue may be in the&s;e devices, it is obvious that neither the patriotic gifts, nor the patrio|tic contribution, can ever be re&s;orted to again. The re&s;ources of public folly are &s;oon exhau&s;ted. The whole indeed of their &s;cheme of revenue is to make, by an artifice, an appearance of a full re|&s;ervoir for the hour, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time they cut off the &s;prings and living fountains of perennial &s;upply. The account not long &s;ince furni&s;hed by Mr. Necker, was meant, without que&s;tion, to be favourable. He gives a flattering view of the means of getting through the year; but he expre&s;&s;es, as it is natural he &s;hould, &s;ome apprehen&s;ion for that which was to &s;ucceed. On this la&s;t prog|no&s;tic, in&s;tead of entering into the grounds of this apprehen&s;ion, in order, by a proper fore&s;ight, to prevent the progno&s;ticated evil, Mr. Necker receives a &s;ort of friendly reprimand from the pre&s;i|dent of the a&s;&s;embly.</P>

and more in fictitious repre&s;entation. When &s;o little within or without is now found but paper, the repre&s;entative not of opulence but of want, the creature not of credit but of power, they ima|gine that our flouri&s;hing &s;tate in England is owing to that bank-paper, and not the bank-paper to the flouri&s;hing condition of our commerce, to the &s;olidity of our credit, and to the total exclu&s;ion of all idea of power from any part of the tran&s;action. They for|get that, in England, not one &s;hilling of paper money of any de&s;cription is received but of choice; that the whole has had its origin in ca&s;h actually depo&s;ited; and that it is convertible, at plea&s;ure, in an in&s;tant, and without the &s;malle&s;t lo&s;s into ca&s;h again. Our paper is of value in commerce, becau&s;e in law it is of none. It is powerful on Change, becau&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall it is impotent. In payment of a debt of twenty &s;hillings, a cre|ditor may refu&s;e all the paper of the bank of England. Nor is there among&s;t us a &s;ingle public &s;ecurity, of any quality or na|ture what&s;oever, that is enforced by authority. In fact, it might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn, that our paper wealth, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the real coin, has a tendency to increa&s;e it; in&s;tead of being a &s;ub|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tute for money, it only facilitates its entry, its exit, and its cir|culation; that it is the &s;ymbol of pro&s;perity, and not the badge of di&s;tre&s;s. Never was a &s;carcity of ca&s;h, and an exuberance of pa|per, a &s;ubject of complaint in this nation.</P>
<P>Well! but a le&s;&s;ening of prodigal expences, and the oeconomy which has been introduced by the virtuous and &s;apient a&s;&s;embly, makes amends for the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in the receipt of revenue. In this at lea&s;t they have fulfilled the duty of a financier. Have tho&s;e, who &s;ay &s;o, looked at the expences of the national a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, of the municipilities, of the city of Paris, of the increa&s;ed pay of the two armies, of the new police, of the new judicatures? Have they even carefully compared the pre&s;ent pen&s;ion-li&s;t with the former? The&s;e politicians have been cruel, not oeconomical. Comparing the expences of the former prodigal government and its relation to the then revenues with the expences of this new &s;y&s;tem as oppo&s;ed to the &s;tate of its new trea&s;ury, I believe the pre&s;ent will be found beyond all compari&s;on more chargeable.</P>
<P>It remains only to con&s;ider the proofs of financial ability, fur|ni&s;hed by the pre&s;ent French managers when they are to rai&s;e &s;up|plies on credit. Here I am a little at a &s;tand; for credit, properly &s;peaking, they have none. The credit of the antient government was not indeed the be&s;t; but they could always, on &s;ome terms, command money, not only at home, but from mo&s;t of the coun|tries of Europe where a &s;urplus capital was accumulated; and the credit of that government improving daily. The e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a &s;y&s;tem of liberty would of cour&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to give it new &s;trength; and &s;o it would actually have done, if a &s;y&s;tem

Why &s;hould the&s;e nations of commerce and oecono|my enter into any pecuniary dealings with a people who attempt to rever&s;e the very nature of things; among&s;t whom they &s;ee the debtor pre&s;cribing, at the point of the bayonet, the medium of his &s;olvency to the creditor; di&s;charging one of his engagements with another; turning his very penury into his re&s;ource; and pay|ing his intere&s;t with his rags?</P>
<P>Their fanatical confidence in the omnipotence of church plun|der, has induced the&s;e philo&s;ophers to overlook all care of the public e&s;tate, ju&s;t as the dream of the philo&s;opher's &s;tone induces dupes, under the more plau&s;ible delu&s;ion of the hermetic art, to neglect all rational means of improving their fortunes.

of the &s;tate, the &s;ole &s;ecurity for the public credit, in the hope of rebuilding it with the materials of confi&s;cated property? If, however, an exce&s;&s;ive zeal for the &s;tate &s;hould have led a pious and venerable prelate (by anticipation a father of the church <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La Bruyere of Bo&s;&s;uet.</NOTE>) to pil|lage his own order, and, for the good of the church and people, to take upon him&s;elf the place of grand financier of confi&s;cation, and comptroller-general of &s;acrilege, he and his coadjutors were, in my opinion, bound to &s;hew, by their &s;ub&s;equent conduct, that they knew &s;omething of the office they a&s;&s;umed. When they had re&s;olved to appropriate to the <HI>Fi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> a certain portion of the landed property of their conquered country, it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to render their bank a real fund of credit, as far as &s;uch a bank was capable of becoming &s;o.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h a current circulating credit upon any <HI>Land-bank,</HI> under any circum&s;tances what&s;oever, has hitherto proved difficult at the very lea&s;t. The attempt has commonly ended in bank|ruptcy. But when the a&s;&s;embly were led, through a contempt of moral, to a defiance of oeconomical principles, it might at lea&s;t have been expected, that nothing would be omitted on their part to le&s;&s;en this difficulty, to prevent any aggravation of this bank|ruptcy. It might be expected, that to render your <HI>Land-bank</HI> to|lerable, every means would be adopted that could di&s;play openne&s;s and candour in the &s;tatement of the &s;ecurity; every thing which could aid the recovery of the demand. To take things in their mo&s;t favourable point of view, your condition was that of a man of a large landed e&s;tate, which he wi&s;hed to di&s;po&s;e of for the di&s;charge of a debt, and the &s;upply of certain &s;ervices. Not being able in&s;tantly to &s;ell, you wi&s;hed to mortgage. What would a man of fair intentions, and a commonly clear under&s;tanding, do in &s;uch circum&s;tances? Ought he not fir&s;t to a&s;certain the gro&s;s value of the e&s;tate; the charges of its management and di&s;po&s;ition; the incumbrances, perpetual and temporary, of all kinds that affect it; then, &s;triking a net &s;urplus, to calculate the ju&s;t value of the &s;ecurity? When that &s;urplus (the only &s;ecurity to the creditor) had been clearly a&s;certained, and properly ve&s;ted in the hands of tru&s;tees; then he would indicate the parcels to be &s;old, and the time, and conditions of &s;ale; after this, he would admit the pub|lic creditor, if he cho&s;e it, to &s;ub&s;cribe his &s;tock into this new fund; or he might receive propo&s;als for an <HI>a&s;&s;ignat</HI> from tho&s;e who would advance money to purcha&s;e this &s;pecies of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>This would be to proceed like men of bu&s;ine&s;s, methodically and rationally; and on the only principles of public and private credit that have an exi&s;tence. The dealer would then know exactly what he purcha&s;ed; and the only doubt which could hang upon his mind would be, the dread of the re&s;umption of the &s;poil,
<PB N="189" REF="023238_0191_0FBED840BABD8D48">
which one day might be made (perhaps with an addition of puni&s;hment) from the &s;acrilegious gripe of tho&s;e execrable wretches who could become purcha&s;ers at the auction of their innocent fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>An open and exact &s;tatement of the clear value of the property, and of the time, the circum&s;tances, and the place of &s;ale, were all nece&s;&s;ary to efface, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;tigma that has hi|therto been branded on every kind of Land-bank. It became ne|ce&s;&s;ary on another principle, that is, on account of a pledge of faith previou&s;ly given on that &s;ubject, that their future fidelity in a &s;lippery concern might be e&s;tabli&s;hed by their adherence to their fir&s;t engagement. When they had finally determined on a &s;tate re&s;ource from church booty, they came, on the 14th of April, 1790, to a &s;olemn re&s;olution on the &s;ubject; and pledged them&s;elves to their country, <Q>that in the &s;tatement of the public charges for each year there &s;hould be brought to account a &s;um &s;ufficient for defraying the expences of the R. C. A. religion, the &s;upport of the mini&s;ters at the altars, the relief of the poor, the pen&s;ions to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;ecular as well as regular, of the one and of the other &s;ex, <HI>in order that the e&s;tates and goods which are at the di&s;po&s;al of the nation may be di&s;engaged of all charges, and employed by the repre&s;entatives, or the legi&s;lative body, to the great and mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of the &s;tate.</HI></Q> They further engaged, on the &s;ame day, that the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for the year 1791 &s;hould be forth|with determined.</P>
<P>In this re&s;olution they admit it their duty to &s;how di&s;tinctly the expence of the above objects, which, by other re&s;olutions, they had before engaged &s;hould be fir&s;t in the order of provi&s;ion. They admit that they ought to &s;hew the e&s;tate clear and di&s;engaged of all charges, and that they &s;hould &s;hew it immediately. Have they done this immediately, or at any time? Have they ever furni&s;hed a rent-roll of the immoveable e&s;tates, or given in an inventory of the moveable effects which they confi&s;cate to their a&s;&s;ignats? In what manner they can fulfil their engagements of holding out to public &s;ervice "an e&s;tate di&s;engaged of all charges," without authenticating the value of the e&s;tate, or the quantum of the charges, I leave it to their Engli&s;h admirers to explain. In&s;tantly upon this a&s;&s;urance, and previou&s;ly to any one &s;tep towards mak|ing it good, they i&s;&s;ue, on the credit of &s;o hand&s;ome a declaration, &s;ixteen millions &s;terling of their paper. This was manly. Who, after this ma&s;terly &s;troke, can doubt of their abilities in finance? But then, before any other emi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e financial <HI>indulgencies,</HI> they took care at lea&s;t to make good their original promi&s;e. If &s;uch e&s;timate, either of the value of the e&s;tate or the amount of the incumbrances, has been made, it has e&s;caped me. I never heard of it. They have however done one thing, which in the
<PB N="190" REF="023238_0192_0FBED841C4778A18">
gro&s;s is clear, ob&s;cure, as u&s;ual, in the detail. They have thrown upon this fund, which was to &s;hew a &s;urplus, di&s;engaged of all charges, a new charge; namely, the compen&s;ation to the whole body of the di&s;banded judicature; and of all &s;uppre&s;&s;ed offices and e&s;tates; a charge which I cannot a&s;certain, but which un|que&s;tionably amounts to many French millions. Another of the new charges, is an annuity of four hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be paid (if they choo&s;e to keep faith) by daily payments, for the intere&s;t of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;igrats. Have they ever given them&s;elves the trouble to &s;tate fairly the expence of the ma|nagement of the church lands in the hands of the municipalities, to who&s;e care, &s;kill, and diligence, and that of their legion of unknown under-agents, they have cho&s;en to commit the charge of the forfeited e&s;tates, and the con&s;equence of which had been &s;o ably pointed out by the bi&s;hop of Nancy?</P>
<P>But it is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the&s;e obvious heads of incum|brance. Have they made out any clear &s;tate of the grand incum|brance of all, I mean the whole of the general and municipal e&s;|tabli&s;hments of all &s;orts, and compared it with the regular income by revenue? Every deficiency in the&s;e becomes a charge on the confi&s;cated e&s;tate, before the creditor can plant his cabbages on an acre of church property. There is no other prop than this con|fi&s;cation to keep the whole &s;tate from tumbling to the ground. In this &s;ituation they have purpo&s;ely covered all that they ought in|du&s;triou&s;ly to have cleared, with a thick fog; and then, blindfold them&s;elves, like bulls that &s;hut their eyes when they pu&s;h, they drive, by the point of the bayonets, their &s;laves, blindfolded in|deed no wor&s;e than their lords, to take their fictions for currencies, and to &s;wallow down paper pills by thirty-four millions &s;terling at a do&s;e. Then they proudly lay in their claim to a future credit, on failure of all their pa&s;t engagements, and at a time when (if in &s;uch a matter any thing can be clear) it is clear that the &s;urplus e&s;tates will never an&s;wer even the fir&s;t of their mortgages, I mean that of the four hundred million (or &s;ixteen millions &s;terling) of <HI>a&s;&s;ignats.</HI> In all this procedure I can di&s;cern neither the &s;olid &s;en&s;e of plain-dealing, nor the &s;ubtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. The objection within the a&s;&s;embly to pulling up the flood gates for this inundation of fraud, are unan&s;wered; but they are thorough|ly refuted by an hundred thou&s;and financiers in the &s;treet. The&s;e are the numbers by which the metaphy&s;ic arithmeticians compute. The&s;e are the grand calculations on which a philo&s;ophical public credit is founded in France. They cannot rai&s;e &s;upplies; but they can rai&s;e mobs. Let them rejoice in the applau&s;es of the club at Dundee, for their wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m in having thus applied the plunder of the citizens to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate. I hear of no addre&s;s upon this &s;ubject from the directors of the Bank of

England; though their approbation would be of a <HI>little</HI> more weight in the &s;cale of credit than that of the club at Dundee. But, to do ju&s;tice to the club, I believe the gentlemen who com|po&s;e it to be wi&s;er than they appear; that they will be le&s;s liberal of their money than of their addre&s;&s;es; and that they would not give a dog's-ear of their mo&s;t rumpled and ragged Scotch paper for twenty of your faire&s;t a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>Early in this year the a&s;&s;embly i&s;&s;ued paper to the amount of &s;ixteen millions &s;terling: What mu&s;t have been the &s;tate into which the a&s;&s;embly has brought your affairs, that the relief afforded by &s;o va&s;t a &s;upply has been hardly perceptible? This paper al&s;o felt an almo&s;t immediate depreciation of five percent. which in little time came to about &s;even. The effect of the&s;e a&s;&s;ignats on the receipt of the revenue is remarkable. Mr. Necker found that the collectors of the revenue, who received in coin, paid the trea&s;ury in <HI>a&s;&s;ignats.</HI> The collectors made &s;even per cent. by thus receiving in money, and accounting in depreciated paper. It was not very difficult to fore&s;ee, that this mu&s;t be inevitable. It was, however, not the le&s;s em|barra&s;&s;ing. Mr. Necker was obliged (I believe, for a con&s;i|derable part, in the market of London) to buy gold and &s;ilver for the mint, which amounted to about twelve thou&s;and pounds above the value of the commodity gained. That mini&s;ter was of opinion, that whatever their &s;ecret nutritive virtue might be, the &s;tate could not live upon <HI>a&s;&s;ignats</HI> alone; that &s;ome real &s;ilver was nece&s;&s;ary, particularly for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e, who having iron in their hands, were not likely to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves for patience, when they &s;hould perceive that whil&s;t an encrea&s;e of pay was held out to them in real money, it was again to be fraudulently drawn back by depreciated paper. The mini&s;ter, in this very natural di&s;tre&s;s, applied to the a&s;&s;embly, that they &s;hould order the collectors to pay in &s;pecie what in &s;pecie they had received. It could not e&s;cape him, that if the trea&s;ury paid 3 per cent. for the u&s;e of a currency, which &s;hould be returned &s;even per cent. wor&s;e than the mini&s;ter i&s;&s;ued it, &s;uch a dealing could not very greatly tend to enrich the public. The a&s;&s;embly took no notice of his recommenda|tion. They were in this dilemma&mdash;If they continued to receive the a&s;&s;ignats, ca&s;h mu&s;t become an alien to their trea&s;ury: If the trea&s;ury &s;hould refu&s;e tho&s;e paper <HI>amulets,</HI> or &s;hould di&s;|countenance them in any degree, they mu&s;t de&s;troy the credit of their &s;ole re&s;ource. They &s;eem then to have made their option; and to have given &s;ome &s;ort of credit to their paper by taking it them&s;elves; at the &s;ame time in their &s;peeches they made a &s;ort of &s;waggering declaration, &s;omething, I rather think, above legi&s;lative competence; that is, that there is no differ|ence

<P>A noble indignation ri&s;es in the minds of your popular lead|ers, on hearing the magic lanthorn in their &s;hew of finance compared to the fraudulent exhibitions of Mr. Law. They cannot bear to hear the &s;ands of his Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi compared with the rock of the church, on which they build their &s;y&s;tem. Pray let them &s;uppre&s;s this glorious &s;pirit, until they &s;hew to the world what piece of &s;olid ground there is for their a&s;&s;ignats, which they have not pre-occupied by other charges. They do inju&s;tice to that great, mother fraud, to compare it with their degenerate imitation. It is not true, that Law built &s;olely on a &s;peculation concerning the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. He added the Ea&s;t India trade; he added the African trade; he added the farms of all the farmed revenue of France. All the&s;e together unque&s;tionably could not &s;upport the &s;tructure which the public enthu&s;ia&s;m, not he, cho&s;e to build upon the&s;e ba&s;es. But the&s;e were, however, in compari&s;on, generous delu&s;ions. They &s;uppo&s;ed, and they aimed at an increa&s;e of the commerce of France. They opened to it the whole range of the two hemi&s;|pheres. They did not think of feeding France from its own &s;ub&s;tance. A grand imagination found in this flight of com|merce &s;omething to captivate. It was wherewithal to dazzle the eye of an eagle. It was not made to entice the &s;mell of a mole, nuzzling and burying him&s;elf in his mother earth, as you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is. Men were not then quite &s;hrunk from their natural dimen&s;ions by a degrading and &s;ordid philo&s;ophy, and fitted for low and vulgar deceptions. Above all remember, that in impo&s;ing on the imagination, the then managers of the &s;y&s;tem made a compliment to the freedom of men. In their fraud there was no mixture of force. This was re&s;erved to our time, to quench the little glimmerings of rea&s;on which might break in upon the &s;olid darkne&s;s of this enlightened age.</P>
<P>On recollection, I have &s;aid nothing of a &s;cheme of finance which may be urged in favour of the abilities of the&s;e gentlemen, and which has been introduced with great pomp, though not yet finally adopted in the national a&s;&s;embly. It comes with &s;omething &s;olid in aid of the credit of the paper circulation; and much has been &s;aid of its utility and its elegance. I mean the project for coining into money the bells of the &s;uppre&s;&s;ed churches. This is their alchymy. There are &s;ome follies which baffle argument; which go beyond ridicule; and which excite no feeling in us but di&s;gu&s;t; and therefore I &s;ay no more upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="023238_0195_0FBED84859B567D8">It is as little worth remarking any farther upon all their drawing and re drawing, on their circulation for putting off the evil day, on the play between the trea&s;ury and the <HI>Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte,</HI> and on all the&s;e old exploded contrivances of mer|cantile fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, now exalted into policy of &s;tate. The revenue will not be trifled with. The prattling about the rights of men will not be accepted in payment for a bi&s;cuit or a pound of gunpowder. Here then the metaphy&s;icians de&s;cend from their airy &s;peculations, and faithfully follow examples. What examples? the examples of bankrupts. But, defeated, baffled, di&s;graced, when their breath, their &s;trength, their inventions, their fancies de&s;ert them, their confidence &s;till maintains its ground. In the manife&s;t failure of their abilities they take credit for their benevolence. When the revenue di&s;appears in their hands, they have the pre&s;umption, in &s;ome of their late proceedings, to value <HI>them&s;elves</HI> on the relief given to the peo|ple. They did not relieve the people. If they entertained &s;uch intentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? The people relieved them&s;elves in &s;pite of the a&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P>But waving all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the parties, who may claim the merit of this fallacious relief, has there been, in effect, any re|lief to the people in any form? Mr. Bailly, one of the grand agents of paper circulation, lets you into the nature of this re|lief. His &s;peech to the National A&s;&s;embly contained an high and laboured panegyric on the inhabitants of Paris for the con|&s;tancy and unbroken re&s;olution with which they have borne their di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. A fine picture of public felicity! What! great courage and unconquerable firmne&s;s of mind to endure benefits, and &s;u&s;tain redre&s;s? One would think from the &s;peech of this learned Lord Mayor, that the Pari&s;ians, for this twelve-month pa&s;t, had been &s;uffering the &s;traits of &s;ome dreadful blockade; that Henry the Fourth had been &s;topping up the ave|nues to their &s;upply, and Sully thundering with his ordinance at the gates of Paris; when in reality they are be&s;ieged by no other enemies than their own madne&s;s and folly, their own cre|dulity and prever&s;ene&s;s. But Mr. Bailly will &s;ooner thaw the eternal ice of his atlantic regions, than re&s;tore the central heat to Paris, whil&s;t it remains <Q>&s;mitten with the cold, dry, petri|&s;ick mace</Q> of a fal&s;e and unfeeling philo&s;ophy. Some time after this &s;peech, that is on the thirteenth of la&s;t Augu&s;t, the &s;ame magi&s;trate, giving an account of his government at the bar of the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows: <Q>In the month of July 1789,</Q> [the period of everla&s;ting comme|moration] <Q>the finances of the city of Paris were <HI>yet</HI> in good order; the expenditure was counterbalanced by the receipt,
<PB N="194" REF="023238_0196_0FBED8514553AD90">
and &s;he had at that time a million [forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling] in bank. The expences which &s;he has been con|&s;trained to incur, <HI>&s;ub&s;equent to the revolution,</HI> amount to 2,500,000 livres. From the&s;e expences, and the great fall|ing off in the product of the <HI>free gifts,</HI> not only a momentary but a <HI>total</HI> want of money has taken place.</Q> This is the Paris upon who&s;e nouri&s;hment, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums, drawn from the vitals of all France, has been expended. As long as Paris &s;tands in the place of antient Rome, &s;o long &s;he will be maintained by the &s;ubject provinces. It is an evil inevitably attendant on the dominion of &s;overeign democratic republics. As it happened in Rome, it may &s;ur|vive that republican domination which gave ri&s;e to it In that ca&s;e de&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the vices of popularity. Rome, under her emperors, united the evils of both &s;y&s;tems; and this unnatural combination was one great cau&s;e of her ruin.</P>
<P>To tell the people that they are relieved by the dilapidation of their public e&s;tate, is a cruel and in&s;olent impo&s;ition. State&s;men, before they valued them&s;elves on the relief given to the people, by the de&s;truction of their revenue, ought fir&s;t to have carefully attended to the &s;olution of this problem:&mdash; Whether it be more advantageous to the people to pay con&s;i|derably, and to gain in proportion; or to gain little or nothing, and to be di&s;burthened of all contribution? My mind is made up to decide in favour of the fir&s;t propo&s;ition. Experience is with me, and, I believe, the be&s;t opinions al&s;o. To keep a balance between the power of acqui&s;ition on the part of the &s;ub|ject, and the demands he is to an&s;wer on the part of the &s;tate, is a fundamental part of the &s;kill of a true politician. The means of acqui&s;ition are prior in time and in arrangement. Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be enabled to acquire, the people, without being &s;ervile, mu&s;t be tractable and obedient. The magi&s;trate mu&s;t have his reverence, the laws their authority. The body of the people mu&s;t not find the principles of natural &s;ubordination by art rooted out of their minds. They mu&s;t re&s;pect that property of which they cannot partake. They mu&s;t labour to obtain what by labour can be obtained; and when they find, as they commonly do, the &s;ucce&s;s di&s;proportioned to the endeavour, they mu&s;t be taught their con&s;olation in the final proportions of eternal ju&s;tice. Of this con&s;olation, whoever deprives them, deadens their indu&s;try, and &s;trikes at the root of all acqui&s;ition as of all con&s;ervation. He that does this is the cruel oppre&s;&s;or, the mercile&s;s enemy of the poor and wretched; at the &s;ame time that by his wicked &s;peculations he expo&s;es the fruits of &s;ucce&s;sful indu&s;try, and the accumulations of fortune, to the plunder of the negligent, the di&s;|appointed, and the unpro&s;perous.</P>
<P>Too many of the financiers by profe&s;&s;ion are apt to &s;ee nothing in revenue, but banks, and circulations, and annuities on lives, and tontines, and perpe|tual
<PB N="195" REF="023238_0197_0FBED852806F2908">
rents, and all the &s;mall wares of the &s;hop. In a &s;ettled order of the &s;tate, the&s;e things are not to be &s;lighted, nor is the &s;kill in them to be held of trivial e&s;timation. They are good, but then only good, when they a&s;&s;ume the effects of that &s;ettled order, and are built upon it. But when men think that the&s;e beggarly contrivances may &s;upply a re&s;ource for the evils which re&s;ult from breaking up the foundations of publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and from cau&s;ing or &s;uffering the principles of property to be &s;ubverted, they will, in the ruin of their country, leave a melancholy and la&s;ting monument of the effect of prepo&s;terous politics, and pre&s;umptuous, &s;hort-&s;ighted, narrow-minded wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The effects of the incapacity &s;hewn by the popular in all the great members of the commonwealth are to be covered with the "all-atoning name" of liberty. In &s;ome people I &s;ee great liberty indeed; in many, if not in the mo&s;t, an op|pre&s;&s;ive degrading &s;ervitude. But what is liberty without wi&s;dom, and without virtue? It is the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madne&s;s, without tuition or re&s;traint. Tho&s;e who know what virtuous liberty is, can|not bear to &s;ee it di&s;graced by incapable heads, on account of their having high-&s;ounding words in their mouths. Grand, &s;welling &s;entiments of liberty, I am &s;ure I do not de&s;pi&s;e. They warm the heart; they enlarge and liberali&s;e our minds; they animate our courage in a time of conflict. Old as I am, I read the fine raptures of Lucan and Corneille with plea&s;ure. Neither do I wholly condemn the little arts and devices of popularity. They facilitate the carrying of many points of moment; they keep the people together; they refre&s;h the mind in its exertions; and they diffu&s;e occa&s;ional gaiety over the &s;evere brow of moral freedom. Every politician ought to &s;acrifice to the graces; and to join compliance with rea&s;on. But in &s;uch an undertaking as that in France, all the&s;e &s;ub&s;idiary &s;entiments and artifices are of little avail. To make a government requires no great prudence. Settle the &s;eat of power; teach obedience: and the work is done. To give freedom is &s;till more ea&s;y. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. But to form a <HI>free government;</HI> that is, to temper together the&s;e oppo&s;ite ele|ments of liberty and re&s;traint in one con&s;i&s;tent work, requires much thought, deep reflection, a &s;agacious, powerful, and combining mind. This I do not find in tho&s;e who take the lead in the national a&s;&s;embly. Perhaps they are not &s;o mi&s;erably deficient as they appear. I rather believe it. It would put them below the common level of human under&s;tanding. But when the leaders cho&s;e to make them&s;elves bidders at an auction of popularity, their talents, in the con&s;truction of the &s;tate, will be of no &s;ervice. They will become flat|terers in&s;tead of legi&s;lators; the in&s;truments, not the guides of the people. If any of them &s;hould happen to propo&s;e a &s;cheme of liberty, &s;oberly limited, and defined with proper qualifications, he will be immediately outbid by his compe|titors, who will produce &s;omething more &s;plendidly popular. Su&s;picions will be rai&s;ed of his fidelity to his cau&s;e. Moderation will be &s;tigmatized as the virtue of cowards; and compromi&s;e as the prudence of traitors; until, in hopes of pre&s;erving the credit which may enable him to temper and moderate on &s;ome occa&s;ions, the popular leader is obliged to become active in propaga|ting doctrines, and e&s;tabli&s;hing powers, that will afterwards defeat any &s;ober purpo&s;e at which he ultimately might have aimed.</P>
<P>But am I &s;o unrea&s;onable as to &s;ee nothing at all that de&s;erves commendation in the indefatigable labours of this a&s;&s;embly? I do not deny that among an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, &s;ome good may have been done. They who de&s;troy every thing certainly will remove &s;ome grievance. They who make every thing new, have a chance that they may e&s;tabli&s;h &s;omething beneficial. To give them credit for what they have done in virtue of the au|thority they have u&s;urped, or which can excu&s;e them in the crimes by which that authority has been acquired, it mu&s;t appear, that the &s;ame things could not have been accompli&s;hed without producing &s;uch a revolution. Mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly
<PB N="196" REF="023238_0198_0FBED853B3113248">
they might; becau&s;e almo&s;t every one of the regulations made by them, which is not very equivocal, was either in the ce&s;&s;ion of the king, voluntarily made at the meeting of the &s;tates, or in the concurrent in&s;tructions to the or|ders. Some u&s;ages have been aboli&s;hed on ju&s;t grounds; but they were &s;uch that if they had &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e as they were to all eternity, they would little detract from the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of any &s;tate. The improvements of the national a&s;&s;embly are &s;uperficial, their errors fundamental.</P>
<P>Whatever they are, I wi&s;h my countrymen rather to recommend to our neighbours the example of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, than to take models from them for the improvement of our own. In the former they have got an inva|luable trea&s;ure. They are not, I think without &s;ome cau&s;es of apprehen&s;ion and complaint; but there they do not owe to their con&s;titution, but to their own conduct. I think our happy &s;ituation owing to our con&s;titution; but owing to the whole of it, and not to any part &s;ingly; owing in a great mea&s;ure to what we have left &s;tanding in our &s;everal reviews and reformations, as well as to what we have altered or &s;uperadded. Our people will find employment enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent &s;pirit, in guarding what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, from violation. I would not exclude alteration neither; but even when I changed, it &s;hould be to pre&s;erve. I &s;hould be led to my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I &s;hould follow the example of our ance&s;tors. I would make the reparation as nearly as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;tyle of the building. A politic caution, a guarded circum&s;pection, a moral rather than a com|plexional timidity were among the ruling principles of our forefathers in their mo&s;t decided conduct. Not being illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of France tell us they have got &s;o abundant a &s;hare, they acted under a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the ignorance and fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus fallibles rewarded them for having in their conduct at|tended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution, if we wi&s;h to de&s;erve their fortune, or to retain their beque&s;ts. Let us add, if we plea&s;e, but let us pre&s;erve what they have left; and, &s;tanding on the firm ground of the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;titution, let us be &s;atisfied to admire rather than attempt to follow in their de&s;perate flights the a&euml;ronauts of France.</P>
<P>I have told you candidly my &s;entiments. I think they are not likely to al|ter yours. I do not know that they ought. You are young; you cannot guide, but mu&s;t follow the fortune of your country. But hereafter they may be of &s;ome u&s;e to you, in &s;ome future form which your commonwealth may take. In the pre&s;ent it can hardly remain; but before its final &s;ettlement it may be obliged to pa&s;s, as one of our poets &s;ays, <Q>through great varieties of untried being,</Q> and in all its tran&s;migrations to be purified by fire and blood.</P>
<P>I have little to recommend my opinions, but long ob&s;ervation and much impartiality. They come from one who has been no tool of power, no flat|terer of greatne&s;s; and who in his la&s;t acts does not wi&s;h to belye the tenour of his life. They come from one, almo&s;t the whole of who&s;e public exertion has been a &s;truggle for the liberty of others; from one in who&s;e brea&s;t no an|ger durable or vehement has ever been kindled, but by what he con&s;idered as tyranny; and who &s;natches from his &s;hare in the endeavours which are u&s;ed by good men to di&s;credit opulent oppre&s;&s;ion, the hours he has employed on your affairs; and who in &s;o doing per&s;uades him&s;elf he has not departed from his u&s;ual office: they come from one who de&s;ires honours, di&s;tinctions, and emoluments, but little; and who expects them not at all; who has no con|tempt for fame, and no fear of obloquy; who &s;huns contention, though he will hazard an opinion: from one who wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency; but who would pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency by varying his means to &s;ecure the unity of his end; and, when the equipoi&s;e of the ve&s;&s;el in which he &s;ails, may be endan|gered by overloading it upon one &s;ide, is de&s;irous of carrying the &s;mall weight of his rea&s;ons to that which may pre&s;erve its equipoi&s;e.</P>
