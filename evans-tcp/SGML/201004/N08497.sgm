<HEAD>A Copy of a LETTER from a GENTLEMAN <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Virginia,</HI> To a Merchant in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I Have read, with much Attention, your Apology for the Merchants of Philadelphia; and think you have great Merit, in at|tempting to vindicate a Conduct, which is deemed inexplicably &s;piritle&s;s by the Inhabitants of every other Colony.</P>
<P>"One would imagine there has been &s;omething very my&s;terious in the Behaviour of the Merchants of Bo&s;ton, to have induced you to treat them with &s;o much Contempt; if their Conduct, &s;ince the fir&s;t Di&s;pute with our Mother-Country, had not been man|ly, candid and ingenuous.</P>
<P>"You confe&s;s, that many of you oppo&s;ed the <HI>Su&s;pen&s;ion</HI> in Con&s;equence of Advice received from your <HI>particular Friends</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> that prudent and pacific Mea&s;ures would be mo&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">able to the Mini&s;try and Parliament; and that it was dangerous to provoke them. This, no doubt, influenced &s;ome among you&mdash;But, in my Opinion, we mu&s;t look &s;omewhere el&s;e for the real Cau&s;e of your Oppo&s;ition: perhaps an Examination into the Nature and De&s;ign of the Stamp-Act, and the grevious one, to which you &s;till bend the Knee, may di&s;cover the lurking Principle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">on which you acted.</P>
<P>"The Stamp-Act was intended to rai&s;e a Revenue in America: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Produce of the &s;everal Duties were ordered to be paid into the Receipt of his Maje&s;ty's Exchequer, and there re&s;erved, to be, from Time to Time, di&s;po&s;ed of by Parliament, towards defending, protecting, and &s;ecuring the American Colonies and Plantations.&mdash;This Act, in your Re&s;olutions for Su&s;pending the Importation of Goods from Great-Britain, you, without Ceremony, declared to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL; you likewi&s;e entered into &s;pirited Mea&s;ures for obtaining a Repeal of it, which had an immediate and a de&s;ired Effect.&mdash;You ob&s;erved, ju&s;tly, that the Stamp-Act was <HI>uncon&s;titutional</HI> &mdash;altho your Rea&s;ons, for believing it to be &s;o, were not then explained. Your Opinion mu&s;t have been founded upon this obvious Truth, That no Power on Earth had a Right to take Money out of your Pockets without your Con&s;ent, expre&s;sly declared by your&s;elves or your cho&s;en Repre&s;entatives.&mdash;Not content with barely remon&s;trating again&s;t the Stamp-Act.&mdash;You al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted "That the many Difficulties you then laboured under, as a trading People, were owing to the Re&s;trictions, Prohibitions, and ill-advi&s;ed Regulations made in the &s;everal <HI>other</HI> Acts of the Parliament of Great-Britain, late|ly pa&s;&s;ed to regulate the Colonies; which had encrea&s;ed the Co&s;t and Expence of many Articles of your Importation, and cut off from you all Means of &s;upplying your&s;elves with Specie enough to pay the Duties impo&s;ed on you, much le&s;s, to &s;erve as a Me|dium of your Trade."</P>
<P>"The Acts, again&s;t which, you &s;poke thus freely&mdash;&s;till remain in full Force and Virtue; and when you obtained a Repeal of the Stamp-Act, glorious as it was&mdash;you obtained but a Part of your Demand.&mdash;The Repeal of it was well worth the Pains and Trouble it co&s;t you.&mdash;It was indeed &s;o replete with mini&s;terial Venom, and proved &s;uch a general and oppre&s;&s;ive Burthen, that Judges, Lawyers, Phy&s;icians, Par&s;ons, Merchants, Farmers, nay Shool-Boys and Orphans, were alike &s;ubject to its baneful Influence.</P>
<P>"The Sufferings of all Ranks of People induced <HI>them</HI> to oppo&s;e it&mdash;Bu&s;ine&s;s was con&s;equently at a Stand.&mdash;The civil Courts were &s;hut, and you could &s;ue no Man for the Recovery of a Debt&mdash;You were therefore <HI>obliged</HI> to &s;acrifice a very con&s;iderable In|tere&s;t; and you determined to import no Goods from Great-Britain, until it was repealed.&mdash;This was <HI>your</HI> Virtue! &mdash;This <HI>your</HI> Re&s;olution!&mdash;Your <HI>Patrioti&s;m</HI> and <HI>private Intere&s;ts</HI> were &s;o intimately connected, that you could not pro&s;titute the one, without endangering the other: And you would have been particularly fortunate, if Great-Britain, when &s;he repealed the Stamp-Act, and redre&s;&s;ed all your Grievances; and had never thought of impo&s;ing new ones&mdash; You would, <HI>then,</HI> have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the Annals of America, among her be&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous Sons, for a <HI>timely</HI> and <HI>re&s;olute</HI> Defence of her Liberties; and the Virtues, which under the pre&s;ent Tax you have de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;lighted, would have been, tho' unmerited, your greate&s;t Glory&mdash; But Charles Town&s;hend, with an artful and penetrating Eye, &s;aw clearly to the Bottom of your Hearts&mdash;He knew, that, the private Intere&s;ts of the Merchants were the Rocks again&s;t which Greenville's favorite <HI>Argo</HI> had unfortunately &s;plit; and that no Act of Parliament, for rai&s;ing a Revenue in America, could be executed without <HI>their</HI> Con&s;ent and Approbation.</P>
<P>"To this Gentleman, you mu&s;t attribute the Lo&s;s of your Reputation: and it was, certainly, <HI>your</HI> Misfortune, and the Mis|fortune of <HI>all America,</HI> that you did not know <HI>him,</HI> as well as he knew <HI>you,</HI>&mdash;He impo&s;ed Duties upon Paper, Gla&s;s, and Painters Colours; Articles of Commerce, which will prove mo&s;t grevious Taxes upon the Country in general; but cannot affect you, as Merchants: For it is notorious, that a Merchant mu&s;t have his Profit on every Article of his Trade, let the Original Co&s;t be what it may: <Q>The Purcha&s;er of any Article, very &s;eldom reflects that the Seller rai&s;es his Price, &s;o as to indemnify him&s;elf for the Tax he has paid. He knows that the Prices of things are continually fluctuating, and if he thinks about the Tax, he thinks at the &s;ame Time, in all probability, that he might have paid as much, if the Articles he buys had not been taxed. He gets &s;omething vi&s;ible and agreeable for his Money; and Tax and Price are &s;o confounded together, that he cannot &s;epa|rate, or does not chu&s;e to take the Trouble of &s;eparating them.</Q>&mdash;Thus have the People of your Province been deceived into a Paci&s;ic Compliance with this particular Act, the Preamble of which declares it is intended to rai&s;e a Revenue in America. You did not e&s;teem it your Duty, as Merchants nor as American Freemen, to oppo&s;e it; BECAUSE IT DID NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT YOUR PRIVATE INTERESTS. The Parliamentary Right, of Taxing America, you thought of little Con&s;equence, when compared with your own Ea&s;e and Safety&mdash;You concluded, that although it was <HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> it could not do much Harm in your Time, and, that, if your Po&s;terity did not like it, or found it in&s;upportable,&mdash;they might endeavour to <HI>remove</HI> it.&mdash;By &s;uch deceitful Rea&s;oning, you per&s;uaded your&s;elves you were di&s;charging your Duty; when you were indu&s;triou&s;ly riveting Chains upon your De&s;cendants, who will have no great Cau&s;e of Obligation to you for &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed Favours&mdash;The Merchants in the Northern Colonies, de&s;pi&s;ed the&s;e inglorious Motives: They were willing to lo&s;e their <HI>whole Trade,</HI> rather than &s;uffer their Coun|try to be en&s;laved&mdash;and for this Rea&s;on determined to &s;u&s;pend the Importation of Goods from Great-Britain, until the &s;everal Acts of P&mdash;t impo&s;ing Duties on America, were repealed.&mdash;This was <HI>their</HI> Virtue! This <HI>their</HI> Re&s;olution!&mdash;Your Oppo&s;ition to this Mea&s;ure prevented it from taking Effect, and you may thank your&s;elves for the ble&s;&s;ed Con&s;equences which are like to follow. &mdash;</P>
<P>"The&s;e Reflections may appear har&s;h and uncharitable; but they are the Reflections of every man, who is not tinctured with the <HI>local</HI> Prejudices of your Province&mdash;Believe me, your Oppo&s;ition to the Propo&s;al of the Merchants of New-York and Bo&s;ton, although it might have been founded upon &s;pecious Arguments, has done infinite Prejudice to the American Cau&s;e; and created great Jealou&s;ies in your Neighbours Brea&s;ts; which, nothing, but your determined Re&s;olution to a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing tho&s;e heavy Burthens, with which they and you are equally oppre&s;&s;ed, will effectually heal&mdash;An Union, between the &s;everal Colonies in Sentiment and Action, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to their Pre&s;ervation; and had not my Lord H&mdash; h been informed, that we were di&s;-united in both&mdash;he would never have treated the Inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay with &s;o much &s;everity; nor the other Colonies with &s;uch indignity. His Lord&s;hip imagined, from the Di&s;union of the&s;e Provinces, of which no Doubt he has had faithful Intelligence, that Dragooning of <HI>One</HI> would intimidate and &s;ilence the <HI>Re&s;t;</HI> and his Judgment was founded upon a plau&s;ible Principle&mdash;However, "there are things which at &s;ometimes even Slaves will not bear;" and I apprehend his Lord&s;hip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Letter will prove too hard even for you to bear. This Letter is an expre&s;s Declaration, that the Mini&s;try intend to direct and influ|ence our A&s;&s;emblies, by threatning them with a Di&s;&s;olution, whenever they may have the Confidence, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ary to mini&s;terial Mandates, to con&s;ult or promote the Safety, Honor and Intere&s;t of their Con&s;tituents. I hope your A&s;&s;embly will take the fir&s;t Opportunity to re&s;ent the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Indignity ever offered to the Repre&s;entatives of a free and loyal People, and &s;hew no Symptoms of that Mode&s;ty of which Mr. Pitt &s;o ju&s;tly complained to the Hou&s;e of Commons.&mdash;if a P&mdash; M&mdash;r in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> he can intimi|date an American A&s;&s;embly, Threats, nay Puni&s;hments, will be made u&s;e of to execute the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h Maxims; and the very Men, whom we may inve&s;t with Power to promote and &s;ecure our Intere&s;ts, will <HI>under &s;uch Influence,</HI> effectually ruin us. For what Faith can we repo&s;e in our A&s;&s;emblies, when they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> an&s;werable to us for this Conduct; <HI>but to arbi|trary Mini&s;ters,</HI> who will always make it their Intere&s;ts to oppre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">? We had better have no Repre&s;entatives, if we cannot, when we think proper, in&s;truct and direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; and, at the &s;ame time, have a rea&s;onable A&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ce of their obeying our Orders. The People are to all Intents and Purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">, <HI>Ma&s;ters.</HI>&mdash;Their Repre&s;entatives are their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Servants &mdash; And we &s;hall be ju&s;tly chargeable with <HI>political Suicide,</HI> if we are &s;tupidly fond of an E&s;tabli&s;hment, which, on the principle of <HI>mini&s;terial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> will de&s;troy our Civil Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"It is, certainly, a mo&s;t cruel Dilemma, to be obliged to &s;acrifice every Thing that is mo&s;t dear and valuable among Men, or to contend with our Mother Country.&mdash;But let us not, in this Ca&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;h Great-Britain from any other Power &mdash; To
<PB REF="010867_0002_0F857D3EA8DC6748">Freemen it mu&s;t be different, who their Oppre&s;&s;ors are&mdash;If Britons oppre&s;s us, and &s;trive might and main to en&s;lave us&mdash;all pretended Ties of ancient Favours, Friend&s;hip, Duty, are de&s;troyed: G&mdash;B &mdash;, France, or any Power on Earth, pur&s;uing the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, ought indi&s;criminately to be oppo&s;ed.&mdash;I &s;hall conclude this Letter with an hi&s;torical Fact very appli|cable to the pre&s;ent Subject.</P>
<P>"The Privernates had been &s;everal Times &s;ubdued by the Romans, and had as often revolted; but their City was at la&s;t retaken by the Con&s;ul Plautius&mdash;In the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Circum&s;tances they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, to &s;ue for Peace&mdash;Upon a Senator's a&s;king them what Puni&s;hment they thought they de&s;erved; one of them an&s;wered, 'That which is due to Men who think them&s;elves worthy of Liberty.' Then the Con&s;ul a&s;ked them, whether there was any Room to hope, that they would ob&s;erve the Peace, if their Fault was pardoned? 'The peace &s;hall be perpetual between us,' replied the Amba&s;&s;ador, "and we &s;hall faithfully ob&s;erve it, if the Conditions you lay upon us are <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable;</HI> but if they are <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>di&s;honorable,</HI> the peace will not be of long Continuance, and we &s;hall very &s;oon break it.'</P>
<P>"Though &s;ome of the Senators were offended at this An&s;wer, yet mo&s;t of them approved of it, and &s;aid that 'it was worthy of a <HI>Man</HI> and of a Man that was <HI>born free:</HI>' acknowledging therefore the Force of the Rights of human Nature, they cried out, that 'tho&s;e alone de&s;erved to be Citizens of Rome, <HI>who e&s;teemed nothing in compari&s;on of Liberty.</HI>' Thus the very Per&s;ons, who were at fir&s;t threatned with Puni&s;hment, were admitted to the Rights of Citizens, and obtained the Conditions they wanted; the generous Refu&s;al of the Privernates to comply with the Terms of a di&s;honourable Treaty, gained them the Privilege of being incorporated into a State, which at that Time could boa&s;t of the brave&s;t, and mo&s;t virtuous Subjects in the Univer&s;e."</P>
