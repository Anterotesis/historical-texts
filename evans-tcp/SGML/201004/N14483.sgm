<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE OPPRESSED AFRICANS.</HEAD>
<P>WE are engaged, under a &s;en&s;e of duty, to bear a public te&s;timony again&s;t a &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion which, under the &s;anction of national au|thority, has long been exerci&s;ed upon the natives of Africa, is grown up into a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, and is unhappily become a con&s;iderable branch of the commerce of this kingdom: an oppre&s;&s;ion which in the inju&s;tice of its origin, and the inhumanity of its progre&s;s, has not, we apprehend, been exceeded, or even equalled, in the mo&s;t barbarous ages.</P>
<P>We are taught, both by the holy &s;criptures, and by the experience of ages, to believe that the Righ|teous Judge of the whole earth cha&s;ti&s;eth nations for their &s;ins, as well as individuals: and can it be expected that he will &s;uffer this great iniquity to go
<PB N="8" REF="018353_0005_0FA5CE50E9A04FA0">unpuni&s;hed? As the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of go|vernment is for a terror to evil-doers, and the prai&s;e of them that do well, we wi&s;h it may be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, whether this has been made the rule of its admini&s;tration in this land. Will it not rather be found on inquiry, that, with re&s;pect to the en&s;laved negroes, its benevolent purpo&s;es have been pervert|ed; that its terrors have fallen on the innocent, while evil doers, and oppre&s;&s;ors, have been openly encouraged?</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding government, in former times, have been induced by what we conceive to be a mi&s;taken, as well as an unju&s;t, policy, to pro|mote this evil, we are per&s;uaded that many of the pre&s;ent members of the legi&s;lature, as true friends of civil and religious liberty, hold this unrighteous trafic in the utmo&s;t abhorrence. This per&s;ua&s;ion, joined to the favourable reception of the petition of our la&s;t Yearly-meeting to the Hou&s;e of Commons, encourages us to addre&s;s you, thus freely, on this important &s;ubject; and we apprehend that the abo|lition of this iniquitous practice is not only required by the calls of ju&s;tice and humanity, but is al&s;o con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy. For avarice in this, as in other in&s;tances, has defeated its own purpo&s;e. Afri|ca, &s;o populous, and &s;o rich in vegetable and mi|neral productions, in&s;tead of affording all the advan|tages of a well regulated commerce, is &s;carcely known but as a mart for &s;laves, and as the &s;cene of violence and barbarities, perpetrated, in order to procure them, by men profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian re|ligion.</P>
<P>The arguments which have been advanced by the few writers, who have attempted to ju&s;tify this in|human bu&s;ine&s;s, can have no weight with generous minds. Tho&s;e, in particular, which are drawn from the permi&s;&s;ion to hold &s;laves among&s;t the Jews, can in no wi&s;e be applied to the practice among&s;t us: for, ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of all our mer|cies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 26.</NOTE>,
<PB N="9" REF="018353_0006_0FA5CE5267F9FE58">who hath made of one blood all nations of men, we now live under a di&s;pen&s;ation e&s;&s;entially different from that of the law; in which many things were permitted to the Jews, becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts. All di&s;tinctions of name and country, &s;o far as they relate to the &s;ocial du|ties, are now aboli&s;hed. We are taught by our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer to look upon all men, even our enemies, as neighbours and brethren, and to do unto them as we would they &s;hould do unto us.</P>
<P>Under a di&s;pen&s;ation &s;o admirably adapted to pro|mote the temporal as well as the eternal happine&s;s of mankind, that any &s;hould deviate &s;o far from its principles, as to encourage a practice &s;o replete with iniquity, and in particular that this nation, ge|nerally characterized by its attachment to civil and religious liberty, &s;hould have contributed, perhaps more than any other, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment and con|tinuance of &s;lavery, is a mo&s;t painful reflection. It would &s;urely have been more con&s;i&s;tent with the avowed principles of Engli&s;hmen, both as men and as Chri&s;tians, if their &s;ettlement in heathen countries had been &s;ucceeded by mild and benevolent at|tempts to civilize their inhabitants, and to incline them to receive the glad tidings of the go&s;pel. But how different a conduct towards them has been pur&s;ued! it has not only been repugnant in a poli|tical view, to tho&s;e commercial advantages which a fair and honourable treatment might have procured, but has evidently tended to increa&s;e the barbarity of their manners, and to excite in their minds an aver|&s;ion to that religion, the profe&s;&s;ors whereof &s;o cru|elly treat them.</P>
<P>This traffic is the principal &s;ource of the de&s;truc|tive wars which prevail among the&s;e unhappy peo|ple, and it is attended with con&s;equences, the mere recital of which is &s;hocking to humanity. The vi|olent &s;eparation of the deare&s;t relatives, the tears of
<PB N="10" REF="018353_0007_0FA5CE5322846D00">conjugal and parental affection, the reluctance of the &s;laves to a voyage from which they can have no pro&s;pect of returning, mu&s;t pre&s;ent &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s which would pierce the heart of any, in whom the principles of humanity are not wholly effaced. This, however, is but the beginning of &s;orrows with the poor captives. Under their cruel treatment on &s;hip|board, where, without regard to health or decency, hundreds are confined within the narrow limits of the hold, numbers peri&s;h; and, by what is called the &s;ea&s;oning in the I&s;lands, many are relieved by a premature death, from that &s;eries of accumulated &s;ufferings which awaits their le&s;s happy &s;urvivors. The mea&s;ure of their afflictions yet remains to be filled; being &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder, and brand|ed with a hot iron, they have yet to linger on, un|pitied, the whole term of their mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, in exce&s;&s;ive labour, and too often under the merci|le&s;s controul of unprincipled and unfeeling men, without proper food or cloathing, or any encou|ragement to &s;weeten their toil; whil&s;t every fault, real, or imaginary, is puni&s;hed with a rigour which is but weakly re&s;trained by the colony laws: in&s;tan|ces of the greate&s;t enormity, even the mo&s;t wanton or deliberate murder of the &s;laves, being only pu|ni&s;hed, if puni&s;hed at all, by trifling pecuniary fines.</P>
<P>But a bare enumeration of the calamities of this wretched people, would exceed the limits propo&s;ed to this &s;hort addre&s;s: we think it not improper, however, to give the following extract from a late author, who was an eye-witne&s;s of the mi&s;eries of this per&s;ecuted race.</P>
<Q><P>If we bring this matter home, and, as Job propo&s;ed to his friends, "put our &s;oul in their &s;ouls &s;tead;" if we con&s;ider our&s;elves, and our children, as expo&s;ed to the hard&s;hips which the&s;e people lie under, in &s;upporting an imaginary greatne&s;s;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="018353_0008_0FA5CE53E6ECE7A0">
Did we, in &s;uch ca&s;e, behold an increa&s;e of luxury and &s;uperfluity among our oppre&s;&s;ors, and therewith feel an increa&s;e of the weight of our burdens, and expect our po&s;terity to groan under oppre&s;&s;ion after us;</P>
<P>Under all this mi&s;ery, had we none to plead our cau&s;e, nor any hope of relief from man, how would our cries a&s;cend to the God of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h, who judgeth the world in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and, in his own time, is a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>When we were hunger-bitten, and could not have &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment, but &s;aw them in ful|ne&s;s, plea&s;ing their ta&s;te with things fetched from far;</P>
<P>When we were wearied with labour, denied the liberty to re&s;t, and &s;aw them &s;pending their time at ea&s;e; when garments, an&s;werable to our nece&s;&s;ities, were denied us, while we &s;aw them cloathed in that which was co&s;tly and deli|cate;</P>
<P>Under &s;uch affliction, how would the&s;e painful feelings ri&s;e up as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t their pretended devotion! And if the name of their religion were mentioned in our hearing, how would it &s;ound in our ears, like a word which &s;ignified &s;elf-exaltation and hardne&s;s of heart!</P>
<P>When a trade is carried on productive of much mi&s;ery, and they who &s;uffer by it are &s;ome thou|&s;ands miles off, the danger is the greater of not laying their &s;ufferings to heart.</P>
<P>In procuring &s;laves from the coa&s;t of Africa, many children are &s;tolen privately; wars al&s;o are encouraged among the negroes: but all is at a great di&s;tance. Many groans ari&s;e from dy|ing men, which we hear not. Many cries are uttered by widows and fatherle&s;s children, which reach not our ears. Many cheeks are wet with tears, and faces &s;ad with unutterable grief, which we &s;ee not. Cruel tyranny is encouraged. The
<PB N="12" REF="018353_0009_0FA5CE54A1B82FD8">hands of robbers are &s;trengthened; and thou|&s;ands reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, who never injured us.</P>
<P>Were we, for the term of one year only, to be eye-witne&s;&s;es to what pa&s;&s;eth in getting the&s;e &s;laves; was the blood which is there &s;hed, to be &s;prinkled on our garments; were the poor captives, bound with thongs, heavy laden with elephants teeth, to pa&s;s before our eyes, in their way to the &s;ea;</P>
<P>Were their bitter lamentations, day after day, to ring in our ears, and their mournful cries in the night, to hinder us from &s;leeping!</P>
<P>Were we to hear the &s;ound of the tumult, when the &s;laves on board the &s;hips attempt to kill the Engli&s;h, and behold the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e bloody conflicts: what pious man could be a witne&s;s to the&s;e things, and &s;ee a trade carried on in this manner, without being deeply affected with &s;or|row?</P></Q>
<P>Our religious &s;ociety in the&s;e kingdoms, and in North America, have for many years tenderly &s;ym|pathized with this unhappy people, under their com|plicated &s;ufferings, and have endeavoured to pro|cure them relief: nor has their cau&s;e been without other advocates; who&s;e numbers we have with much &s;atisfaction ob&s;erved to increa&s;e. The expectation of many, who are anxiou&s;ly concerned for the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of this national evil, is now under Provi|dence, fixed upon the wi&s;e and humane interpo&s;iti|on of the legi&s;lature; to whom, with dutiful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, we earne&s;tly recommend the &s;erious con|&s;ideration of this important &s;ubject; with a plea&s;ing hope, that the re&s;ult will be, a prohibition of this traffic in future, and an exten&s;ion of &s;uch relief to tho&s;e who already groan in bondage, as ju&s;tice and mercy may dictate, and their particular &s;ituations may admit. That &s;o the ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e who are ready to peri&s;h may re&s;t upon you, and this nation may no longer, on their account, remain obnoxious
