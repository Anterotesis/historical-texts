<HEAD>CONJECTURES UPON THE NATURE AND MOTION OF METEORS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>UPON &s;everal ob&s;ervations made upon &s;undry Meteors, which have appeared in Europe and New-England, I have collected the following general phaenomena:</P>
<P N="1">I. THEY appear like round balls of fire, or globes of red hot iron, or white hot iron, ready to melt, as large as the &s;un or moon, in the meridian, com|monly &s;urrounded with a flame which appears like a tail, with &s;treams and &s;parkles net &s;o bright as the body. They frequently exceed the light of the moon, and in &s;ome in&s;tances that of the &s;un, &s;o as to make a &s;hadow in the cleare&s;t &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P N="2">II. THESE Meteors have been &s;een pa&s;&s;ing through the air, at all points of the compa&s;s, over a &s;pace of ground above 100, and &s;ometimes above 500 miles long, and above 100 miles wide, with an exceeding great velo&s;ity. I could never get ob|&s;ervations accurate enough, to determine the velocity with any degree of exactne&s;s. Doctor Halley &s;uppo&s;es it to be above 300 miles, and Doctor Pringle about 1000, in a minute. I rather &s;uppo&s;e it does not exceed 500, for the rea&s;ons hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">III. To each particular per&s;on ob&s;erving, who &s;tands in or near the line of their cour&s;e, they &s;eem to ri&s;e while they are coming towards him, and to fall when they are going from him, as the &s;un ri&s;es and &s;ets, &s;eemingly at a &s;mall di&s;tance. But by comparing the ob&s;ervations made by &s;everal per&s;ons &s;tanding a little out of the line of their cour&s;e, at the di&s;tance of 50, 100, or 500 miles from each other, it ap|pears that at their fir&s;t approach or appearance they are 50 or 100 miles di&s;tant from the earth; then they come within 20 or 30 miles of it; and afterwards are at the di&s;tance of 50 or 100 miles again; which different di&s;tances &s;eem to ari&s;e principally from the curvatur of the earth. Or if the&s;e &s;everal di&s;tances of any one Meteor have not been accurately determined on both &s;ides of its neare&s;t approach, yet it is evident, that &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Meteors, during the time in which they have been ob&s;erved, have been coming nearer to the earth, and others going farther from it.</P>

<P N="5">V. ALTHOUGH the&s;e Meteors, by rea&s;on of their extreme velocity and great di&s;|tance, generally become invi&s;ible in about a minute after they pa&s;s by; and as they recede from any per&s;on, pre&s;ently make but a &s;mall angle with the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zon, and &s;eem to be &s;uddenly intercepted by horizontal clouds, hou&s;es, &amp;c. yet there is no &s;ufficient evidence that any of the&s;e high Meteors, which have moved 100 miles or more, ever did really fall to the ground, or become wholly extinct; though after the emi&s;&s;ion of &s;o much of their fire in the explo&s;ion, they are not &s;o bright, and have no flame or tails.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THESE Meteors generally appear as often or oftener than once in 20 or 30 years. Near ten of them have been &s;een in England within the&s;e 100 years; as re|lated in the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of. Tran&s;. Abr. vol. II. page 200; vol.

Three or f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur &s;uch Meteors have been ob|&s;erved in New England within the&s;e 50 years; but as they have been generally &s;up|po&s;ed to be of the &s;ame nature with thunder, lightning, &s;hooting &s;tars, and &s;uch like lower Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eors, which &s;eem to have no exi&s;tence above two or three minutes, there have not been &s;uch critical ob&s;ervations made upon them as I could wi&s;h may be made hereafter. Yet the&s;e general phaenomena, I take to be as certain as can ordi|na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be collected from &s;uch &s;udden, tran&s;ient, and unexpected ob&s;ervations, gene|rally made by the lower &s;ort of people: And have therefore been led to conjecture a new Theory of the nature and motion of the&s;e high Meteors.</P>
<P>Now to a&s;&s;ign a natural cau&s;e or rea&s;on for any thing, is to re&s;olve it into the ge|neral laws of nature, by which the wi&s;e Creator governs the world; and to &s;hew its connection with other things, according to tho&s;e general laws by which we find the univer&s;e is governed, &s;o far as we are acquainted with it. And the fewer laws we have recour&s;e to, which will &s;olve all the apparent phaenomena, the greater is the probability that we have hit upon the true theory. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. IF the apparent diameter of the&s;e fiery globes is equal to tho&s;e of the &s;un or moon, in the meridian, and &s;ubtends an angle of above half a degree, at the di&s;tance of 50 miles from the ob&s;erver, then it is evident that their real diameter is half a mile at lea&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. IT &s;eems evident that the&s;e globes are &s;olid and firm, at lea&s;t as to the ex|ternal parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE, they pre&s;erve their globular &s;hape and motion throughout their whole cour&s;e, and after the explo&s;ion. For if they con&s;i&s;ted only of inflammable
<PB N="7" REF="017113_0005_0FA02F4DA10DC2F0">matter, of the nature of pulvis fulminans, or a train of gun-powder, fired at one and, (as &s;ome of the lower Meteors &s;eem to do) there would be no probability that they would inva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iably pre&s;erve their exact globular &s;hape; but would melt down, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n up, or di&s;&s;ipate with &s;uch an inten&s;e heat, as mu&s;t cau&s;e or accompany &s;uch a va&s;t explo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of flame and &s;ound.</P>
<P N="2">2. BECAUSE, they are &s;trong and firm enough to with&s;tand the force of &s;o great a &s;hock as is given at the explo&s;ion. The noi&s;e is generally repre&s;ented as being equal to loud thunder, a large cannon near by, or a thou&s;and cannon at the di&s;tance of 20 or 30 miles. And I &s;uppo&s;e that a thou&s;and cannon fired at the di&s;tance of 25 miles, give ju&s;t as loud a report as one cannon at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile. The greatne&s;s of the explo&s;ion being in a &s;e&s;quiplicate ratio of the di&s;tance heard
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The undulations of &s;ound are propagated from a &s;onorific body in concave &s;hells, in|crea&s;ing very much like the blowing up of a bladder The whole pre&s;&s;ure of the air upon the in&s;ide of the &s;hell, is equal at all magnitudes, taking the whole &s;hell together; but le&s;&s;er upon each particular part or &s;pot, as it grows bigger. The magnitude of the &s;ound is in proportion to the &s;olid content of the &s;pherical &s;hell; and the audibility of it (at any particu|lar di&s;tance) is in proportion to the pre&s;&s;ure upon any particular part, at that di&s;tance. Therefore, as the &s;olid content of the &s;phere is to the &s;uperficies, or as the cube of any number is to the &s;quare of the &s;ame number, &s;o is the magnitude of a &s;ound to the di&s;tance heard. Or multiply the di&s;tance by the &s;quare root of it&s;elf, and it gives the magnitude of the &s;ound.</P>

And if the Meteor is about 30 miles high, where the atmo&s;phere is 500 times more rare than it is upon the earth, in order to produce the &s;ame &s;ound to our ears, it mu&s;t be equal to 500,000 cannon fired upon the earth. And if this explo&s;ion is made by an ela&s;tick fluid, as violent as gun powder, then the matter of this globe mu&s;t be as &s;trong and firm as the iron of cannon, and the &s;ides of the &s;ame proportional thick|ne&s;s, which is about 50 rods, in order to &s;tand &s;uch a violent &s;hock. If this explo&s;ion is cau&s;ed by an ela&s;tick fluid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the nature of electrical fire, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew, then the firmne&s;s of the globe mu&s;t be almo&s;t the &s;ame. For when a body is charged with it, at or near the in&s;tant when it is di&s;charged, the &s;ire is retained in it with as great a force, as that with which it is di&s;charged, or would &s;trike again&s;t another body. So that the force with which the fire goes out, by any ela&s;tick &s;pring, or repulfive power, is impre&s;&s;ed on the body it leaves. Or if it be drawn out by the attraction of &s;ome other body, the force of that attraction is taken off from the body it leaves, which will have the &s;ame effects upon it. And hence a large phial or jarr, when it is overcharged with electrical fire, will &s;ometimes bur&s;t, like a bomb, and that although it was &s;trong enough to with&s;tand the weight or expan&s;ion of the air, which is 15lb. on every &s;uperficial inch; and &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ure upon a &s;phere half a mile in diameter, will lie above 5,000,000lb</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be objected, the clouds are not &s;olid bodies, and yet they emit a vio|lent explo&s;ion;&mdash;to this I reply, that the explo&s;ion of thunder and lightning is but very &s;mall, in compari&s;on with that of a Meteor; for, thunder is rarely heard 10 miles, whereas, a Meteor may be heard above 100; and the thunder mu&s;t be within half a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, to be heard as loud as a Meteor at the di&s;tance of 30. And upon computation of the different di&s;tances and rarity of the air, it will appear, that the

And if the explo&s;ion of a Meteor is &s;o great, when the noi&s;e heard is only equal to the report of a &s;ingle cannon near by; how great mu&s;t it be in tho&s;e in&s;tances, where it cau&s;es an earthquake 40 or 50 miles round? It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be &s;uch a prodigious forcible explo&s;ion, without making an alteration in its perfect globular &s;hape, unle&s;s it be very rigid and firm

<P N="3">3. THEIR &s;olidity appears from their extreme velocity for many hundreds of miles: For, if a meer flame, &s;moke, or powder, or any thing not &s;trongly cement|ed together, was &s;hot out of a cannon at the velocity of 500 miles a minute, it would immediately diffipate or di&s;&s;olve: Or, if &s;o great a body &s;hould continue to|gether, it would nece&s;&s;arily drive before it a large column of air, which, by the re|&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of the <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> would be extremely conden&s;ed, and the friction of it, by the &s;ides of the Meteor, would pre&s;ently wear it away, unle&s;s it was very hard and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. The round ball always runs away, and leaves the flame, tail and &s;parkles be|hind it; ju&s;t as a cannon ball leaves the fire and &s;moke, or the nucleus of a comet runs before its tail. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, it &s;eems evident, that the globe of the&s;e Meteors is a firm, &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance; at lea&s;t, as to the external part.&mdash;I would, then, ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">III. THERE is a continued whizzing, humming, or rumbling noi&s;e, like di&s;tant drums, guns, or thunder, made by the&s;e Meteors, and heard pre&s;ently after they pa&s;s b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, about a quarter &s;o loud as the explo&s;ion: I &s;uppo&s;e this is cau&s;ed by the friction of the Meteor upon the atmo&s;phere;&mdash;for a cannon ball, of &s;ix inches in diameter, pa&s;&s;ing through the air, with 1-25th part of the velocity of the Meteor, will make a humming noi&s;e, which is generally heard two miles. Now, if we multiply the &s;quare of the difference of the velocities, into the &s;quare of the difference of the dia|meters, we &s;hall find that the re&s;i&s;tance of the air upon the Meteor is, to that upon a cannon ball, as 17,000,000,000 to 1.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Newton's Princip. Math. Book</HI> II. <HI>Prop.</HI> 35. <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And 6,700,000 being the &s;quare of that number of which 17,000,000,000 is the cube, will repre&s;ent the proportion of the di&s;tance in which the humming of the Meteor will be heard farther than that of a cannon-ball: And being dimini&s;hed to a 500th part on account of the rarity of the atmo&s;phere, the proportion will be as 13,400 to 1. And becau&s;e the humming of
<PB N="9" REF="017113_0007_0FA02F4F01A4DE30">the cannon-ball is heard but a 50th part &s;o far as the report of a cannon, that num|ber mu&s;t be divided by 50, which will make the humming noi&s;e of the Meteor equal to the report of 268 cannon, at the di&s;tance of 25 miles. And the expro&s;ion of the Meteor being repre&s;ented to be equal to 100 cannon at that di&s;tance, the humming|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e will be 14th part of it. And this humming noi&s;e will be le&s;s, as the di&s;tance or altitude of the Meteor is greater.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE great explo&s;ion and flame attending the&s;e Meteors, is cau&s;ed by the di&s;charge of electrical fire, collected by the friction of the atmo&s;phere, and emitted about the time, or a little after, it approaches neare&s;t to the earth, and becomes overcharged. I &s;uppo&s;e electrical fire is not e&s;&s;entially different from common fire, and is a kind of univer&s;al element diffu&s;ed, in &s;ome degree, into almo&s;t all bodies in the univer&s;e, and, by friction, may be collected into a much greater quantity in &s;ome particular bodies: And, when the whole &s;uddenly ru&s;hes out in one place or &s;tream, it is there &s;o greatly collected or conden&s;ed, like the rays of the &s;un in a focus, that it becomes common fire, capable of inflaming any combu&s;tible matter; and, by the extreme celerity of its motion, &s;o violently agitates the air, as that its ela&s;tick &s;pring becomes &s;en&s;ible to the ear. Common experience teaches, that when a col|lection of vi&s;ible fire is once begun, the friction of the air upon it, at the velocity of half a mile a minute (as in the blowing of a pair of bellows) will inflame and increa&s;e it to a very great degree: And, therefore, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the fric|tion of the air, at the velocity of 1000 half miles in a minute, (the force of which is 1,000,000 to 1) will collect fire where it was not begun before, or but in a low degree; as all bodies grow warm by friction: And, we find by experience, that fire is often collected by &s;oft bodies, which do not make &s;o great a re&s;i&s;tance as conden|&s;ed air, though moved with a velocity much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s than that of a Meteor.&mdash;Dr. Boer|have, on Chymi&s;try, page 249, &s;peaking of collecting fire by friction, &s;ays, <Q>The &s;urfaces of two bodies being applied together, one may pa&s;s &s;o &s;wiftly by the other, as that nothing but fire, the &s;wifte&s;t body in nature, can &s;ucceed immediately into the vacant places; and by that means it becomes collected, in the path of the moving body, and &s;o it has, as it were, a fiery atmo&s;phere around it.
