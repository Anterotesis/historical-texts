<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION, con&s;i&s;ting in the knowledge and wor&s;hip of God, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of man, from the other inhabitants of the earth. The bru|tal creation bear a re&s;emblance to him in a &s;pecies of rea|&s;on, adapted to their condition. But no traces of reli|gion are to be found among them. They neither know God, or wor&s;hip him. In this &s;pecific difference of ca|pacity; man is dignified, and rai&s;ed above the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, and a&s;&s;imulated to the angels of heaven, and was made originally but little lower than they. And with them, it is the purpo&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, he &s;hall finally and forever a&s;&s;ociate in the &s;ublimer knowledge and &s;ervices of the cele&s;tial world.</P>
<P>BY the fatal apo&s;tacy, the glorious crown of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s fell from our head; and man naturally likes not to retain God in his knowledge. In con&s;equence of the merciful purpo&s;e of God in our redemption, the rich and various means, which the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God hath appointed for our re&s;toration to duty and happine&s;s, excite the devoute&s;t admiration, gratitude and obedience of every &s;erious mind. Among the&s;e may be reckoned as none of the lea&s;t, that natural &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, of good and evil in conduct, in many branches of duty, which the mind in&s;tantaneou&s;ly perceives, and al&s;o that
<PB N="iv" REF="028999_0003_0FDD6026B1D8E510">e&s;&s;ential and immutable difference between them, which we arrive at the more perfect knowledge of, by the exer|ci&s;e of the rational faculties.</P>
<P>BUT an authority &s;uperior to our in&s;tinctive percepti|on, or rational inve&s;tigation, is nece&s;&s;ary to command ef|fectually, our obedience. This &s;uperior authority is no other than the <HI>WILL OF GOD.</HI> This is the alone per|fect and &s;ufficient foundation of all moral obligation, duty and obedience.</P>
<P>OUR moral &s;en&s;e or natural con&s;cience, and rea&s;on|ings on the nature of duty, of right and wrong, and of virtue and vice, are liable to be perverted by various prejudices, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. And this hath ever been the ca&s;e, where the divine will has not been expre&s;&s;|ly revealed.</P>
<P>WITH faculties unhappily controled by a depraved nature, the wi&s;e&s;t men of pagan antiquity, greatly erred in their &s;y&s;tems of ethics. While they profe&s;&s;edly &s;ought to know God and duty, they wandered further from him.</P>
<P>THEIR precepts and example gave currency to many vices, which they fal&s;ely named virtues; and many of the virtues of the unadulterated religion of nature, and of the evangelic &s;y&s;tem, they proudly rejected. Ambition and revenge, were accounted commendable virtues. To the divine virtues of forgivene&s;s of injuries, meekne&s;s, and humility, they were &s;trangers. Fraud and di&s;hon|e&s;ty were held in repute among the Spartans and Egyp|tians, and robbery among the Arabians. The enlight|ened Romans and Grecians practi&s;ed ob&s;cene and cruel rites, in honor of their Gods. Their choice&s;t amu&s;ements were the &s;avage &s;pectacle of men combating with wild bea&s;ts, and devoured by them; and gladiators falling by mutual &s;laughter, in their theatres. Nations expo&s;ed
<PB N="v" REF="028999_0004_0FDD6027C925D7B8">their aged and helple&s;s, and their deformed infants, to be devoured by bea&s;ts of prey.</P>
<P>THEIR ideas of the acceptable wor&s;hip of God, were as ab&s;urd and impure, as their morality was defective and pernicious. If we look back to the manners of the age in which the moral law was revealed, we &s;hall &s;ee the nations, lying in &s;till more deplorable darkne&s;s and vice.</P>
<P>SUCH being the melancholy condition of human na|ture, the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Deity was &s;een in the republication of the great &s;y&s;tem of natural religion, for the in&s;truction of all generations.</P>
<P>THE following di&s;cour&s;es were delivered, in the cour&s;e of &s;everal months, to the beloved people of the author's pa&s;toral charge. In their publication, he tru&s;ts, that he is not prompted by the vain opinion of merit in the execution of them, but by a &s;incere de&s;ire, that they may afford &s;pir|itual edification to &s;ome of his fellow chri&s;tians, and in|quirers after truth and &s;alvation, benefit the ri&s;ing gene|ration, and &s;erve the common cau&s;e of virtue and religion. Let us love God's law and keep it, for ble&s;&s;ed are all they who do his commandments.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON I. GOD the &s;upreme Lawgiver of the Univer&s;e, and his covenant relation to his Church.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS XX, 1 and 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And God &s;pake all the&s;e words &s;aying; I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the hou&s;e of bondage.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ASOLEMNITY, expre&s;&s;ive of the authority and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the &s;upreme Lawgiver, introduces the weighty precepts of his holy law. A law of univer&s;al and perpetual obligation, and re|vealed for the benefit and practice of all nations and generations.</P>
<P>WHILE our thoughts are invited to this divine &s;y&s;tem of duty, let our devoute&s;t meditations hum|bly invoke the father of lights, in the language of the pious prophet of former ages, "O Lord, open thou our eyes, that we may behold wonderous things out of thy Law."</P>
<P>THE words of the text have an immediate refer|ence to the &s;pecial providence of God, di&s;played in
<PB REF="028999_0006_0FDDCFA3BA144940">the miraculous redemption of the people of I&s;rael, from their bondage in Egypt. This was figurative of our redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from the more dreadful bondage of &s;in, and all our &s;piritual foes, and admittance to the promi&s;ed, purcha&s;ed inheri|tance, in the heavenly world.</P>
<P>FROM the death of Jo&s;eph, to the delivery of the Law at Sinai, was about one hundred and &s;ixty yeas. In which &s;pace of time, the de&s;cendents of Jacob had marvellou&s;ly increa&s;ed. They had long endu|red the mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ions from the Egyp|tians; but God was mindful of his covenant with their pious ance&s;tor Abraham, and rai&s;ed up, from the mid&s;t of them, a deliverer. Within a few weeks after their pa&s;&s;age thro' the Red Sea, they arrived at Mount Sinai, called al&s;o Horeb, where God pro|claimed with awful &s;olemn maje&s;ty, the moral law.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of the one true God, and of the moral law given to man at his creation, by the cor|rupt pa&s;&s;ions and vices of men, were greatly ob&s;cu|red, and in danger of being nearly extingui&s;hed. They had in all parts of the earth, greatly corrup|ted their ways, and perverted original revelations to the Patriarchs, handed down by oral tradition. It was nece&s;&s;ary that the knowledge of the true God and his laws, &s;hould be again revived. And God cho&s;e the nation of I&s;rael as the repo&s;itory of that knowledge, becau&s;e from them was to ari&s;e, the promi&s;ed Saviour, who was to enlighten Jews and Gentiles, and in whom all nations &s;hould be ble&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>A SYSTEM of eccle&s;ia&s;tic and civil laws were given, at the &s;ame time. They were wi&s;ely calculated to pre&s;erve the Hebrews from the idolatrous practices,
<PB REF="028999_0007_0FDDCFA8A5A30280">and the licentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s manners, of other nations,&mdash;to keep alive the hope and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tation of the promi&s;ed Saviour, and to pre&s;erve their national church and commonwealth, until that important period.</P>
<P>THE moral law, becau&s;e of its &s;uperior excel|lence and univer&s;al obligation, was fir&s;t revealed, and u&s;hered in with a &s;olemnity and grandeur, ex|ceeding any thing which the world had ever be|held.</P>
<P>GOD called Mo&s;es up into the mount and direct|ed him to prepare the people for the awful &s;olem|nity. "And on the third day, in the morning, there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud up|on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceed|ing loud; &s;o that all the people in the camp, trem|bled. And Mount Sinai <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as altogether in a &s;moke, becau&s;e the Lord de&s;cended up on it in a fire, and the &s;moke a&s;cended as the &s;moke of a fur|nace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."</P>
<P>STRUCK with the profounde&s;t awe, at the amaz|ing glory which attended a de&s;cending God, the people retired from the foot of the mount; and ho|ly Mo&s;es who had often familiarly conver&s;ed with God, could &s;carce &s;u&s;tain the &s;ight.</P>
<P>THUS God prepared the minds of men to receive his holy laws.</P>
<P>THE &s;olemn declaration of Jehovah, which in|troduces the precepts of the moral law, contains &s;everal mo&s;t important truths, to &s;ome of which, with humble dependence on the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we will now attend. As,</P>

<ITEM>1. GOD is the &s;upreme Legi&s;lator of the Univer&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT his church, or profe&s;&s;ing wor&s;hippers are introduced into a &s;pecial covenant relation to God, and laid under inviolable obligations of obedience, to his whole revealed will.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>THRO' the&s;e divi&s;ions of this &s;ubject, I &s;hall oc|ca&s;ionally, illu&s;trate the nature and obligations of the moral law in general, as compri&s;ed in the ten commandments.</P>
<P>WHEN God proclaims him&s;elf, "I am the Lord," he expre&s;&s;es his ab&s;olute and &s;upreme au|thority and right to command the obedience of his rational creatures, to his revealed will. He is the Jehovah, the <HI>I am,</HI> who is from all everla&s;ting, without beginning or ending, inhabiting eternity. From whom all creatures and things have derived their exi&s;tance, He who made all things is alone equal to the great work of univer&s;al government. As his knowledge is infinite he is perfectly acquaint|ed with the capacities and wants of his creatures, and can pre&s;cribe to them rules and laws exactly &s;uited to their powers, capacities and condition. And his infinite goodne&s;s will forever incline him to do according to this dictate of his wi&s;dom. Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</P>
<P>ALL creatures depend on God for their continu|ance, and for all tho&s;e favorable circum&s;tances, which make exi&s;tence de&s;irable. And in his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s alone mu&s;t we confide for all the good things which we hope for in future life, and through|out
<PB N="11" REF="028999_0009_0FDDCFAB5C0C09D8">the endle&s;s periods of our immortal exi&s;tence. Since then we are thus dependent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> God, his right to us, and to our perpetual love, gratitude and obe|dience is mo&s;t ab&s;olute. In God we live and move and have our being.</P>
<P>SINCE the unhappy apo&s;tacy mankind are di&s;in|clined to keep the holy laws of God. By nature and practice we are alas, the &s;ervants of &s;in. Our guilt and mi&s;ery ari&s;es from our co-operation with evil &s;pirits in the cau&s;e of an unnatural rebellion again&s;t the pure laws of our creator. We like not to re|tain God in our knowledge. To bring us back to our loyalty and love, God has been plea&s;ed to de|nounce dreadful puni&s;hments on the breakers of his law, and glorious rewards to the obedient. His laws operate on our hopes and fears, to deter us from &s;in as the greate&s;t mi&s;ery, and to per&s;uade us to obedi|ence, as our chief happine&s;s.</P>
<P>AWFUL &s;anctions, the terrors of jo&s;tice, &s;urround the holy laws delivered at Sinai. We &s;ee the face of an angry God, and feel our&s;elves guilty and con|demned, but at the &s;ame time we di&s;cover the di|vine mercy amid&s;t all the terror, &s;hining with com|fort on all the penitent and obedient.</P>
<P>MOSES, ju&s;t before his death, reminds the people of that awful maje&s;ty, which had been di&s;played at the revelation of the law, which had made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, as time could not efface, "The Lord came from Sinai, and ro&s;e up from Seir. He &s;hined forth from mount Paran, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> came with ten thou&s;ands of &s;aints; from his right hand went a fiery law." To this &s;ame event al&s;o the p&s;almi&s;t &s;eems to refer P&s;alm 18th. "The earth &s;hook and trembled, the foundations of the hills moved,
<PB N="12" REF="028999_0010_0FDDCFAF76963E40">He bowed the heavens al&s;o and came down, and darkne&s;s was under his feet. He rode upon a Che|rub, yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. His pavilion round about him, were dark waters, and thick clouds of the &s;ky. The Lord al&s;o thun|dered in the heavens, and the highe&s;t gave his voice; hail-&s;tones and coals of fire."</P>

<P>THUS &s;olemn and awful were the di&s;plays of the greatne&s;s and ju&s;tice of Jehovah, at the publication of the Law; but more &s;olemn and awful, &s;till will be the &s;cene when at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t great day, the Law &s;hall be executed on the&s;e who have not kept it, nor fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o for refuge to the righteou&s;ne&s;s revealed by the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>BEFORE the law, the will of God had been re|vealed from time to time, u&s;ually by the mini&s;tra|tion of Angels. But at Mount Sinai, the Deity him&s;elf appeared in a vi&s;ible glory. When the eter|nal law of piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;a law e&s;tabli&s;hed on immutable principles, the moral law, which St. Paul de&s;ines, holy, ju&s;t and good, was to be re|vealed to a whole nation, and by them tran&s;mitted to all generations of men; the Deity did not commit this bu&s;ine&s;s to the agency of the greate&s;t angel in heaven, but him&s;elf &s;peaks and writes the command|ments of the law on two plates of &s;tone. Significant emblem of the heart hardned by &s;in; and of the nece&s;lity of heavenly grace, to in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">be God's law
<PB N="13" REF="028999_0011_0FDDCFB10FB948A8">upon our minds in &s;uch living impre&s;&s;ions, that we &s;hall love and keep it. <Q>Take from us, O Lord, the heart of &s;tone, and give us an heart of fle&s;h, and impre&s;s in lively characters, thy pure laws there!</Q></P>
<P>THE laws were depo&s;ited in the Ark, which was divinely appointed to be a type of Chri&s;t; and this &s;ignified, that he only could perfectly keep the law; who &s;aid, "I delight to do thy will, O God, yea thy law is within my heart." They were wrote on &s;tone to teach us their perpetual obligation. They were divided into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tables. The fir&s;t re&s;pects the duties which we owe to God, and contains four precepts. The other table contains &s;ix, and they relate to the duties which we owe to our fellow men, and the government and regulation of our thoughts, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WE have no account of any written law until the time of Mo&s;es. The fir&s;t laws of God to man, committed to writing was the moral law, and wrote by God him&s;elf. They were pre&s;erved thro' many generations, in the &s;acred Ark.</P>
<P>THAT it was God, and not an Angel, who deli|vered the moral law, appears from his claiming tho&s;e attributes which belong to God only. "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keep|ing mercy for thou&s;ands, forgiving iniquity and &s;in; and who will by no means clear the guilty." It is probable it was God the &s;on, even he by whom all things were made, both in heaven and on earth, whether vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible; and to whom, the &s;crip|tures a&s;&s;ure us, all government and judgment are committed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="028999_0012_0FDDCFB266248AA8">
THE apo&s;tle &s;ays the law was received by the di&s;|po&s;ition of angels. By which, is to be uncer&s;tood, that a ho&s;t of angels, the cele&s;tial retinue of God, attended him at the delivery of the law. And pro|bably by their agency, the mountain was covered with awful thunders and lightnings; and the &s;ame glorious ho&s;ts will attend Chri&s;t to judgment, and be the executors of the &s;entences, which will be pa&s;&s;ed upon men and angels.</P>
<P>GOD is the fountain of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s and every perfection. The moral law is a tran&s;|cript of the&s;e, and demands of us, an imitation of the moral perfections of God; that we &s;hould be holy, and ju&s;t and good, becau&s;e God is. For with|out a conformity to him, we are unqualified for com|munion with him or the enjoyment of his &s;pecial favor. The tenor of this law is, <HI>"He who continu|eth in all things written therein, &s;hall live."</HI> He &s;hall enjoy the love and friend&s;hip of God, and po&s;&s;e&s;s an immortal life. And the penalty annexed to di&s;obe|dience is, <HI>"The &s;oul that &s;inneth &s;hall die; For cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed is every one who continueth not in all things written in this law to do them."</HI> He &s;hall fall under the di&s;|plea&s;ure of God, and &s;uffer the execution of tempo|ral and eternal death. For a &s;ingle wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|on is an offence again&s;t the whole law, and the &s;u|preme lawgiver, and contains the principle of di&s;o|bedience to every particular precept.</P>
<P>THE law is &s;piritual, and demands the perfect homage of the &s;oul, as well as external obedience, God is a &s;pirit, and they who wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth. Our obedience to all the holy precepts of God's law, tho&s;e which re&s;pect our fellow men as well as our Maker, mu&s;t flow from a good principle; a principle of love and
<PB N="15" REF="028999_0013_0FDDCFB67811B6C8">loyalty to God. Without this qualification, all obedience is e&s;&s;entially defective. His command|ments are exceeding broad. They extend to the heart. They demand purity, truth and the &s;incerity of love there. Man looketh on the outward appear|ance, but God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s;earcheth the heart. The law e&s;&s;en|tially con&s;i&s;ts in love. It was a law in the heart of man in innocency and during that &s;hort period, he perfectly kept it. He loved God with all his heart, and loved the creatures which God had made, ac|cording to the degrees of worth and loveline&s;s, which he &s;aw in them. In doing this, he acted up to the dictates of right rea&s;on, which is but another name for the moral law. But by the fatal apo&s;tacy man lo&s;t both the ability and the inclination to obey the law perfectly. By one man &s;in entered into the world, and human nature is depraved. The law, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, is &s;piritual, but we are carnal. We are all gone out of the way. There is none who does good in the fight of the law, no not one. It hath concluded all under &s;in and condemnation.</P>
<P>THE law demands a per&s;onal and perfect obedi|ance from every man. Je&s;us Chri&s;t perfectly obey|ed the law in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oom of the di&s;obedient, yet men are not thereby excu&s;ed from the obligations of a per&s;onal and perfect obedience. The obedience however, of the be&s;t of men is deficient. For there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth, who liveth and &s;inneth not. But the &s;incere, tho' imperfect obedience of believers is accepted, on account of the perfect obedience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s, to every one who believeth. He magnified the law and made it honorable, and God is reconcilable to men, thro' his ble&s;&s;ed mediation. We come</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="028999_0014_0FDDCFB80E945878">
II. To &s;peak of the &s;pecial covenant relation to God, into which believers are introduced, and their obligations of obedience. God was plea&s;ed to admit into a covenant relation his profe&s;&s;ing wor&s;hippers, or the members of his church on earth, and &s;tiles him&s;elf their God, &s;aying I am <HI>thy</HI> God. Individ|ual per&s;ons or people have in all ages been admitted into this covenant relation. This grace was &s;hewn to Adam&mdash;to Abel&mdash;to Noah, and to Abraham, and to the de&s;cendants of Jacob. The whole nation of the Hebrews were admitted at Sinai. The tenor of this covenant of grace is, "I will be your God, and ye &s;hall be my people." The covenant of grace has been one and the &s;ame from the beginning. All the faithful from Adam to Abraham were admitted to the privileges of it. He was their God and they his people in a &s;en&s;e that did not apply to others. And the covenant of grace into which righteous men were admitted in early ages, is the &s;ame as that into which believers are now admitted. The principle differences were mere circum&s;tantials, and the chief of the&s;e were, that they believed in a Saviour to come, and we believe in him already come. The go&s;pel, &s;ays St. Paul, was preached to Abraham. He &s;aw Chri&s;t's day, by faith, and rejoiced in the Saviour.

<P>THE Mo&s;t High admitted the whole nation of I&s;rael, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of all the ex|ternal &s;igns, &s;eals and privileges of the covenant of grace, altho' none but the righteous or regenerate were entitled to the &s;pecial &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ovenant.

<PB N="17" REF="028999_0015_0FDDCFB9938ED9E8">God called him&s;elf their God, and them his people; and they promi&s;ed allegiance to him. He received them upon the ground of their profe&s;&s;ion, as their public judge, altho' as the &s;earcher of hearts, he knew that multitudes of them were in&s;incere, and inwardly the &s;ervants of &s;in, as afterwards appeared by their murmurs and rebellions. The mo&s;t high has herein given example to his mini&s;ters and churches in all ages, that in the admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons into the church, and to the enjoyment of &s;pecial or|dinances, they are to proceed upon the ground of public credible evidence. When the church was under the immediate care of Jehovah, we find that per&s;ons were admitted upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith and allegiance, who were hypocritical and in the bonds of iniquity, as impious Korah and his a&s;&s;ociates. And when the church was about to be formed upon the plan of the go&s;pel, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who knew what was in man, received an hypocritical Judas, the &s;e|cret &s;ervant of &s;in and Satan, among the number of his immediate di&s;ciples.</P>

<P N="3">III. To &s;hew that God is the Almighty and merciful Redeemer of men. The redemption of I&s;|rael from the &s;lavery of Egypt, their &s;ufferings and pre&s;ervation thro' the Red Sea and the wilderne&s;s, and their happy &s;ettlement in the land of promi&s;e, were divinely de&s;igned as &s;hadows or types of good things to come, and a &s;ure earne&s;t to the ancient church, of a more glorious redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE watchful providence of God over the Jewi&s;h commonwealth, is particularly recorded, by divine direction, becau&s;e it contained the only church of God on earth. It was marvellou&s;ly pre&s;erved, as was the ark of Noah, floating on the waters of the deluge. They both imbo&s;omed this precious trea|&s;ure. God has &s;et up a holy kingdom in this rebel|lious
<PB N="20" REF="028999_0018_0FDDCFBD030B24F0">province of his dominions, and wonderfully guards it from the oppo&s;ing powers of this world, and all the powers of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT was a great deliverance which God wrought for his ancient church, when in &s;pite of Egypt and all her horned gods, he conducted from the hou&s;e of bondage, that va&s;t body of defencele&s;s people encumbered with the &s;poils of their oppre&s;&s;ors; and led them thro' the wilderne&s;s like a flock, by the hand of Mo&s;es and Aaron.</P>
<P>THEY experienced a like wonderful redemption from captivity in Babylon; and God often appeared on their &s;ide, when nations were ready to &s;wallow them up. They were the &s;pecial charge of heaven, until the promi&s;ed and long expected Me&s;&s;iah and Saviour of Jews and Gentiles came, and accom|pli&s;hed that glorious redemption, which now glad|ens the chri&s;tian people and nations of the earth.</P>
<P>THE redemption of I&s;rael from Egypt was &s;pirit|ually typical of our redemption from the &s;ervitude of &s;in and Satan, and all our woes. The ble&s;&s;ed Mediator redeems us from &s;piritual Egypt, the kingdom of darkne&s;s, and will conduct the faithful thro' the Red Seas of &s;ufferings, and the darkne&s;s and temptations of this world, to the heavenly Ca|naan. That it was de&s;igned as a lively figure of this, may be infered from frequent allu&s;ions in the &s;criptures and from the declaration of the divine &s;pirit, by the father of the harbinger of Je&s;us. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, for he hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his people, as he &s;pake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been &s;ince the world began, that we &s;hould be &s;aved from our enemies;&mdash;to perform the mercy promi&s;ed to our
<PB N="21" REF="028999_0019_0FDDCFC289C8CA90">fathers; and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he &s;ware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might &s;erve him without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s before him all the days of our life."</P>
<P>THE great de&s;ign of our redemption from &s;in and condemnation is, that we &s;hould &s;erve God in holi|ne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and keep his command|ments. This great redemption compri&s;es &s;undry invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, the mo&s;t important of which were &s;hadowed forth by the redemption of I&s;rael. For</P>
<P N="1">1. JESUS Chri&s;t redeems his people from the bon|dage of &s;in and the tyranny of &s;piritual foes. The &s;acred oracles give us a melancholy de&s;cription of man's moral &s;tate, and the deep depravity of our nature; and our own experience confirms it. Man has ri&s;en up in rebellion again&s;t his Creator; by nature the &s;ervant of &s;in and confederate with evil &s;pirits, in oppo&s;ing the holy laws and government of God. The &s;ame hatred of holine&s;s and of God which exi&s;ts in fallen angels is in man, tho' pro|bably in a le&s;s degree. Therefore our Lord tells the Jews that they were the children of the devil, for wicked men do the works of that evil &s;pirit. And are we by nature better than they? The &s;ame evil propen&s;ities and lu&s;ts and oppo&s;ition to the pure laws of God, reign naturally in all hearts. God re&s;trains the wrath and wickedne&s;s of &s;ome, and changes by effectual grace, the hearts of others and they become his willing and obedient &s;ervants. The dreadful depravity of our nature, is a hum|bling doctrine. And upon the plan of the go&s;pel it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be deeply &s;en&s;ible of it, in order
<PB N="22" REF="028999_0020_0FDDCFC40F428268">to repentance and &s;alvation. Without this, we &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to fly to Chri&s;t for refuge from the cur&s;es of the broken law, and the wrath to come. All who &s;o do, the Almighty and merciful Redeem|er delivers from the reign of &s;in and the power of evil &s;pirits. They are tran&s;lated from the kingdom of darkne&s;s, into the kingdom of God's dear &s;on, and &s;erve him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. In them, the captain of our &s;alvation de&s;troys the domi|nion of him who has the power of death. They are no longer his willing &s;ubjects; they are freed from this &s;piritual Pharaoh and all his ho&s;ts, and re|nounce his &s;ervice forever. And he that is born of God cannot &s;in, as once he did, with deliberate wil|lingne&s;s, for he is made free in Chri&s;t. Satan rages to loo&s;e his prey, but rages in vain, for Chri&s;t is their Almighty Redeemer. "You, &s;ays St. Paul to the Ephe&s;ians, hath he quickened who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; wherein in time pa&s;t ye walked according to the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now worketh in the children of di&s;obedience. A|mong whom al&s;o we all had our conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t, in the lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of our fle&s;h, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others. But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in &s;ins, hath quickened us together with Chri&s;t."</P>
<P N="2">2. JESUS Chri&s;t redeems his people from the con|demnation and cur&s;e of the law. He was a &s;in offer|ing for us and bore the cur&s;e due to man's di&s;obedi|ence. The moral law demanding finle&s;s obedience pronounces a cur&s;e on him that tran&s;gre&s;&s;es "cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all thing written in the law to do them." All men have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="23" REF="028999_0021_0FDDCFC585E2C660">and fallen under the dreadful &s;entence. But the co|venant of grace provides a remedy, when the cove|nant of works could find none. For help is laid on one mighty to &s;ave, who died the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s; and there is now no condemnation to them, who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. By him the law is &s;atisfied and &s;alvation is given; and God can now be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of the ungodly.</P>
<P N="3">3. HE redeems them from the burthen&s;ome and co&s;tly rituals of the mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation. This was a yoke of bondage, placed upon the church in its minority; but the yoke of Chri&s;t is ea&s;y and his burden is light. The bloody rites, the co&s;tly offer|ings and the bodily &s;ervices have given place to a milder di&s;po&s;ation, &s;imple, rational, pure and &s;pi|ritual. The true wor&s;hippers now wor&s;hip the father in &s;pirit and in truth.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of go&s;pel churches and ordi|nances had been foretold. "From the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, &s;ays Malachi, even unto the going down of the &s;ame, my name &s;hall be great among the Gen|tiles, and in every place incen&s;e, the incen&s;e of public prayer and prai&s;e, &s;hall be offered to my name, and a pure offering, for my name &s;hall be great among the Gentiles." In the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel and the beauties of holine&s;s, God is now wor&s;hiped in the churches which are according to the pure and perfect plan e&s;tabli&s;hed by Chri&s;t, and his in&s;pired apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>AND to carry on the work of the &s;anctification and per&s;everance of his church and people, all needful a&s;&s;i&s;tances are given by their Redeemer. Some of the&s;e, and which we are to receive as a precious legacy from him, are the chri&s;tian &s;abbath
<PB N="24" REF="028999_0022_0FDDCFCCAFFD1C48">&mdash;the evangelic mini&s;try and ordinances&mdash;various providences, and the light and con&s;olations of the divine &s;pirit. By the&s;e the holy kingdon of Je&s;us is maintained, and will be perpetuated and enlarged until the end of the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. HE redeems his people from the &s;ervile fear of death, and from future mi&s;ery, and will introduce them to a glorious and immortal inheritance.</P>
<P>TO the impenitent &s;inner, whom the holy law condemns, the pro&s;pect of death, the judgment and eternity is covered with dreadful terrors, and noth|ing but faith in a living Redeemer can remove the awful gloom, and in&s;pire the mind with fortitude and peace on its entrance on eternal &s;cenes. The righteous have hope in death, for Chri&s;t redeems them from the wrath to come and hath a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hall live and reign with him forever.</P>
<P>THUS the redemption of I&s;rael from Egypt, and their e&s;tabli&s;hment in the promi&s;ed land, was to the ancient church, &s;ignificant of a more glorious re|demption to be accompli&s;hed in due time by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>SOME REFLECTIONS, ari&s;ing from this im|portant &s;ubject will conclude.</P>
<P N="1">I. As the moral law contained in the decalogue, is the law of our nature, or right rea&s;on, and found|ed in love to God and mankind, it is of univer&s;al obligation, and a law to us as well as to the ancient Jews. Our Lord has incorporated it with the go&s;pel, and taught us our obligations to keep it. He came not to de&s;troy the law. He has compri&s;ed the ten commandments of the law in love to God and men.
<PB N="25" REF="028999_0023_0FDDCFCDDA8FD1E8">The fir&s;t commandment or table of the law is, thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, might and mind. And the &s;econd commandment or table of the law is, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. This is the &s;um of the commandments, and what the light of nature teaches, and is a law in&s;cribed upon the heart. And tho&s;e who have not the written law, feel its force; as appears by the rea&s;oning of St. Paul, Romans &s;econd chapter, where he a&s;&s;erts that the rea&s;onings and works of the Gentiles, &s;hew the law to be written upon their hearts. In the go&s;pel of Matthew, our Lord, in his expo&s;ition of the precepts of the moral law, re&s;cues it from the corrupt and fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es of Jewi&s;h interpre|ters, and e&s;tabli&s;hes it upon its original principles of benevolence and ju&s;tice. For the Jews had intro|duced many precepts and practices &s;ubver&s;ive of the law, under the pretence of their obtaining ju&s;tificati|on by the works of the law.</P>
<P>THE &s;incere chri&s;tian who &s;trives to keep this holy law, yet finds that in many things he offends, and in all things comes &s;hort of that perfect obedience which it demands. He depends not therefore on his own works, for by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified. The meretorious ground of his dependance is the alone &s;potle&s;s and univer&s;al obedi|ence of him, who is the end of the law for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth.</P>
<P N="2">II. LET our obedience to God's commandments be &s;uch as he will approve. That it may be &s;o, it mu&s;t be according to his word. The whole duty which God requires of us, we are con&s;cientiou&s;ly to do. Let us do what we do from a right principle, a prin|ciple of &s;upreme love to God, for this is the fir&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="028999_0024_0FDDCFCF47F4F4F0">requirement of the law. The Lord &s;earcheth the heart, to give to every one according to his works. The works of the heart, the principle or di&s;po&s;ition which prompts our actions and doings, renders our works good or evil in the view of the Deity. O may our hearts be right with God; and let them not be far from him, while we draw nigh to him, in profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>OUR obedience, &s;irs, to be acceptable mu&s;t be univer&s;al. Let us not then pre&s;ume to pick and chu&s;e among God's commandments, as did the Phari&s;ees, only &s;uch as &s;uit our intere&s;ts or conveni|ence. We have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that religious zeal which confines it&s;elf to the duties of one table of the law, to the neglect of the other. Let us not vainly imagine, on the one hand, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> zealous ob&s;er|vance of external duty to God in religious wor&s;hip, will atone for the omi&s;&s;ion of the duties which we owe to men; nor on the other hand, that punctual ju&s;tice hone&s;ty and charity to men, will excu&s;e for the omi&s;|&s;ion of the duties of piety and devotion to God. The &s;ame authority commands our obedience to both tables of the law. Neither let us deceive our|&s;elves with the imagination, that our external obedi|ence to all the precepts of both tables of the law, will be accepted, while we indulge the lu&s;t of covetou&s;|ne&s;s which is idolatry, or the love of our&s;elves, or our own intere&s;t and happine&s;s as the ruling motive of our obedience. Let the love of God, be ever the animating principle, and then &s;hall we not be a&s;hamed when we have re&s;pect to all God's com|mandments.</P>
<P>LET none imagine that becau&s;e Chri&s;t has per|fectly obeyed the law for our &s;alvation, that there|fore we are excu&s;ed from the obligations of a per&s;on|al
<PB N="27" REF="028999_0025_0FDDCFD5F647E3A8">and perfect obedience. "Does faith make void the law?" So far from this it e&s;tabli&s;hes our perpetu|al obedience to it. For Chri&s;t ha&s;t taught us by his obedience, that the law is holy, ju&s;t and good, and worthy to be obeyed. Let us adore that wi&s;|dom and grace which has provided a divine Re|deemer, who has rendered that perfect obedience to the law which we were unable to do, and opened a way for mercy to flow to offenders.</P>
<P N="3">III. A con&s;ideration of the maje&s;ty and conde&s;cen|&s;ion of God, who has revealed to us his holy law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and taught us all that he requireth of us, ought powerfully to con&s;train us to obedience. It is Je|hovah the univer&s;al king who made all worlds, and ruleth them in infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, who commands our obedience, who mercifully pre&s;cribes to us tho&s;e laws, by which our hearts and lives are to be regulated. When therefore he &s;ays by his ho|ly word, to each &s;oul of us, "ye &s;hall keep my commandments and do them;" let our hearts in filial obedience and lowly dependance reply, "Thy commandments, O Lord, will we keep." Let us fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</P>
<P>THE law which we are entering upon the con&s;ider|ation of, is mo&s;t excellent and divine. It is the great law of rea&s;on, and exactly &s;uited to our nature condition and connections, as the creatures of God, as his offending &s;ubjects, as accountable and immor|tal. It al&s;o con&s;iders us in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, and gives general rules of univer&s;al behaviour, in all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances. It is &s;piritual as well as ex|ternal, and extends to the thoughts and emotions of the heart. Its precepts are conci&s;e and plain, vari|ous and copious, wraping together in epitome our
<PB N="28" REF="028999_0026_0FDDCFD783EF2038">whole duty. Let us, &s;irs, in&s;cribe them upon our hearts and practi&s;e them in our lives.</P>
<P>WE learn the privileges of tho&s;e who &s;tand in a covenant relation to God, and who&s;e God is the Lord. The privileges of the church of God on earth are much every way, chiefly becau&s;e that un|to them are committed the oracles of God, the ho|ly law and the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel&mdash;the chri&s;tian &s;abbath and ordinances; the convincing, reforming and &s;anctifying influences of the divine &s;pirit, and the hope of eternal life.</P>
<P>THE great de&s;ign of the perfect holy law, is to pre|pare us for go&s;pel ble&s;&s;ings. By the law is the know|ledge of &s;in. It acquaints us with our guilt and danger, our helple&s;s and hopele&s;s condition. It hath concluded us all under &s;in and condemnation. It teaches us the dreadful terrors which will attend the execution of its &s;entence. It proclaims its cur|&s;es in thunder, lightning and flaming ruin upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, that all hope of life, from the cove|nant of works may be cut off, and the &s;inner com|pelled to e&s;cape for protection to the covenant of grace, the all perfect and fini&s;hed righteou&s;ne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. "The law was added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion," or to teach us that we are verily guilty before God, and that thro' the weakne&s;s of the fle&s;h, we cannot &s;atisfy or perfectly keep it, and thus &s;erve as a &s;chool-ma&s;ter to lead us to Chri&s;t. This good office it performs, in the hands of the divine &s;pirit, &s;hewing us that it is a holy and perfect law, and that we cannot keep it, that it is a good law, and mu&s;t be kept, that it is a ju&s;t law and mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. The knowledge of the law is nece&s;&s;ary to all men, for their &s;alvation. To the unbelieving, the impenitent, and the bold
<PB N="29" REF="028999_0027_0FDDCFDE89D2D8C8">tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, it proclaims in dreadful accents, the wrath of God, due to &s;in. It is the means &s;anctified in the hand of the divine &s;pirit to convince of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and the judgement to come. And the righteous man is by it in&s;tructed in all duty to God and men.</P>
<P>THE &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> who has not embraced, by a cordial repentance and humble faith the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t tendered to him, in the covenant of grace, remains under the condemnation of the covenant of works, and without a reformation, mu&s;t endure its dreadful wrath. O &s;irs, knowing the terrors of the law, let us be per&s;uaded now to prepare for that day, when the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall again de&s;cend, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, when not only mount Sinai, but every mountain of our globe &s;hall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn as a furnace at his pre&s;ence, and the ele|ments melt with fervent heat, when he &s;hall come to execute the law upon them who have not kept it, nor obeyed his go&s;pel, who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and from the glory of his power; when he &s;hall come, to be glorified in his &s;aints and to be admired in all them that believe.</P>

<P>THIS comprehen&s;ive &s;entence, is the fir&s;t pre|cept or commandment of the law of nature and revelation; and teaches us that Jehovah is the one only God, whom all rational beings are &s;upreme|ly to love, wor&s;hip and obey.

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that almo&s;t all the duties which mankind owe to God and to one another, are in the decalogue forcibly expre&s;&s;ed by negative precepts.

"Tho' there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things and we in him."

He is "the God not of the Jews only, but al&s;o of the Gentiles," and the God of univer&s;al nature; who made the heavens and the earth, and all their ho&s;ts; eternal, &s;elfexi&s;ting, uncreated, underived; infinite in all perfection, mo&s;t powerful, wi&s;e and good; mo&s;t holy, immutable, ju&s;t and true, omni&s;cient, every where pre&s;ent, and infinitely happy; the alone almighty pre&s;erver and governor of all things; who&s;e providence is intimately conver&s;ant in all events, directing, permitting and overruling all
<PB N="33" REF="028999_0030_0FDDCFE80EDACBA0">things for his own glory and the happine&s;s of the univer&s;e. Hence al&s;o we are taught that God is a &s;pirit uncompounded, and who filleth all places; the con&s;tant witne&s;s of our thoughts and conduct; and the &s;upreme and righteous judge, who di&s;tributes rewards and puni&s;hments among his creatures accord|ing to their re&s;pective moral characters; and that to love, wor&s;hip and plea&s;e God, is man's only duty; that his favor is our &s;upreme happine&s;s, and his di&s;|plea&s;ure the greate&s;t evil which creatures can &s;uffer. This is the God who&s;e exi&s;tence is here declared, and whom we are commanded to have as our God; and to e&s;teem, love and obey as the greate&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of beings.</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence of God is a natural principle and a dictate of the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. It is one of tho&s;e luminous truths with which the rational mind is naturally and nece&s;&s;arily impre&s;&s;ed. The certainty of this truth, that there is a God, we arrive at the knowledge of, by an impre&s;&s;ion of natural con|&s;cience, or an intuitive perception, as well as by a chain of rea&s;oning. The untutored &s;avage, feels a more lively impre&s;&s;ion of the exi&s;tence of God, the creator and ruler of all things, than the philo&s;opher &s;o called, who labors to dive&s;t him&s;elf of this natural principle. So dear and evident is this great truth, that we do not find throughout divine revelation, any arguments expre&s;sly deduced to prove the exi&s;tence of God, altho' there are many declarations of the unity of God, in oppo&s;ition to the polythei&s;m of the pagan nations. No miracle was ever wrought to convince an athei&s;t; for he who&s;e heart can reject the natural impre&s;&s;ion of this truth, is prepared to reject all kinds of evidence, and is given over to the judgment of a reprobate mind. It is our duty and felicity to have our minds ever impre&s;&s;ed with a live|ly
<PB N="34" REF="028999_0031_0FDDCFEDD35ED108">and &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of the exi&s;tence and perfections of God. The knowledge of God is the life of the &s;oul. "This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God." It is the fountain of divine &s;cience. And altho' "by &s;earching we cannot find out God, or the almighty to perfection," yet it is mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary for us to &s;trive to know &s;o much as we are capa|ble, of the character, the ways and the laws of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE unity of God, or that there is but one God, is a doctrine taught by the law of nature, and abundantly confirmed by revelation. One being infinite in all perfection is &s;ufficient for the produc|tion of all things. The &s;uppo&s;ition of more Gods than one, is incon&s;i&s;tent with infinite perfection of either; for the infinite power and perfection of one, would limit and circum&s;cribe the power and perfec|tion of the other. The creator of the univer&s;e mu&s;t be perfect in all the attributes of Deity, infinite and unbounded in eternity, immen&s;ity and power, and uncontroled in his &s;overeign will. But this could not be the ca&s;e, were there more Gods than one.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE works of creation prove the exi&s;tence of one God. As the univer&s;e could not give it&s;elf exi&s;t|ence, it mu&s;t be the work of an almighty fir&s;t cau&s;e, the fountain of intelligence, &s;elf-exi&s;ting, eternal, infinitely powerful, wife and good. The wi&s;dom and de&s;ign which appear in the works of creation and of providence, &s;o far as we are able to di&s;cover, &s;hew that they are the work of an intelligent being. This appears in the fitne&s;s of things to the ends and purpo&s;es for which they are made. We di&s;cover the traces of admirable wi&s;dom in the regular and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive revolutions of the heavenly bodies&mdash;in the ne|ce&s;&s;ary and grateful vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and of day and night;&mdash;in the uniform or|der
<PB N="35" REF="028999_0032_0FDDCFEEB5AE10C0">and harmony of the laws of nature, and the due proportion which creatures and things bear to each other, and to the places and conditions a&s;&s;igned them. They teach us that the world and all things therein are the production of the power, the &s;kill, and the goodne&s;s of a being, perfect in knowledge and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>To communicate happine&s;s to creatures appears to be one chief end of the Deity in the creation. "His tender mercies are on all his works," de|manding the united acknowledgement, gratitude and love of all intelligences. This unity of de&s;ign proves the Univer&s;e to be the production of an infi|nitely benevolent and perfect being.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE fir&s;t idea which &s;trikes the mind in the contemplation of creation is that of <HI>power,</HI> great be|yond all conception. St. Paul mentions this as the fir&s;t evidence in creation of the exi&s;tence of God.&mdash; Creation thro' all her works, proclaims this attri|bute. It is &s;een and under&s;tood by the things which are made, even his <HI>eternal power.</HI> Should a rational being ari&s;e at once into life, perfect in all his faculties, and look up and around him, upon the works of God; &s;hould he &s;ee the &s;un, that va&s;t body of light and heat, ri&s;ing in the ea&s;t, travelling thro' the &s;ky, and when &s;unk in the we&s;t, &s;ee the moon &s;ucceeding, with paler rays;&mdash;&s;hould he rai&s;e his eyes to the &s;hining &s;tars, contemplate their number, their order and amazing di&s;tance; illuminating probably other inhabited &s;y&s;tems; his mind would be filled with awful admiration at the amazing grandeur of the &s;o|lemn &s;cene. How augu&s;t is this Univer&s;e! How great the power which created it!</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t exertions of human power appear little and de&s;picable, placed in contra&s;t with the
<PB N="36" REF="028999_0033_0FDDCFF06AB205F0">proofs which this earth it&s;elf gives of the power of God. The large&s;t cities and mo&s;t magnificent buildings, reared by the united labor of miriads, are dimini&s;hed in the view of the lofty mountains, rai&s;ing their heads to the clouds&mdash;the maje&s;tic rivers, running thro' continents&mdash;or the va&s;t oceans which roll around the globe. He who&s;e &s;ingle &s;trength cannot rai&s;e a ma&s;&s;y &s;tone from the earth, mu&s;t be amazed at the power of God, who formed the mountains and &s;pread abroad the plains, and &s;cooped the ba&s;ons of the &s;eas; who placed the &s;un and planets in their &s;tations, and moves their inconceivable magnitudes in their regular orbits.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE works of creation proclaim the wi&s;dom of God. Wi&s;dom ever proceeds in her works with &s;ome good de&s;ign, and u&s;es the be&s;t means for its accompli&s;hment. To di&s;play the glorious perfec|tions of the Deity, and to communicate happine&s;s to the intelligent univer&s;e, appear to be two princi|pal purpo&s;es of God in creation. The heavens and the earth proclaim his glorious perfections, and God is good unto all. Our limited capacities can form but very imperfect conceptions of the wi&s;dom of the Deity. We are lo&s;t in admiration at the multitude of his operations; and we &s;ee but a &s;mall part of the plans of the divine mind: But we &s;ee enough to &s;atisfy us, that a wi&s;dom un&s;earchable and infinite, planned the univer&s;e, and pre&s;ides over all, demanding our devoute&s;t adoration and prai&s;e. As the wi&s;dom of an intelligent mind appears in the works of creation, we hence infer that they came not by chance. For chance is nothing, and can produce nothing. The wonder|ful formation of the great as well as minute crea|tures and things which compo&s;e the univer&s;e, and the ample provi&s;ion made for their con&s;ervation, pro|claim
<PB N="37" REF="028999_0034_0FDDCFF7D3C31500">the infinite and unbounded wi&s;dom of their great original. When we di&s;cover wi&s;dom or &s;kill in the contrivance of any work, we conclude that the maker thereof was wi&s;e. We refer the prai&s;e of wi&s;dom to him and not to the workman&s;hip. In this &s;en&s;e mu&s;t men be under&s;tood, when they &s;ay that nature is wi&s;e, or good; that is, that the author of nature is &s;o. As a fini&s;hed and well proportioned hou&s;e, proves the &s;kill of him who made it, &s;o does the world proclaim the divine &s;kill of the Creator. What un&s;earchable wonders of wi&s;dom appear in the organization of all animals, from the elephant down to the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect! How wonderful are their na|tures and qualities adapted to their re&s;pective condi|tions! From the full &s;tore hou&s;e of his bounty, all animals on the earth, in the air and &s;ea, are abund|antly fed. "The eyes of all, O Lord, wait upon thee, and thou &s;atisfie&s;t their wants! O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all!"</P>
<P N="5">V. THE works of creation and providence proclaim the goodne&s;s of God. Without good|ne&s;s there can be no wi&s;dom. But the&s;e two at|tributes &s;weetly unite and gloriou&s;ly harmonize in all the works and ways of God. The &s;uitable and plen|tiful provi&s;ion made for the exi&s;tence and comfort of all animals, which inhabit the regions of the air&mdash; the element of water,&mdash;or which live on the dry land, teach us, that as all creatures are derived from God, on his rich bounty they al&s;o depend, for their con&s;tant pre&s;ervation. The earth is a well ac|commodated habitation for man and bea&s;t. The &s;ea is a &s;tore hou&s;e of provi&s;ion for its finny tenants. And from thence the clouds receive the vapors, which wafted over the earth di&s;til in dews and rains to refre&s;h the dry ground and make it fruitful, and
<PB N="38" REF="028999_0035_0FDDCFF7D743B428">to feed the numerous &s;prings and rivers, which water the earth and &s;upport and comfort its inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>How expre&s;&s;ive of the goodne&s;s and the wi&s;dom of God, is the creation of the element of <HI>air;</HI> and happily adapted to the life and conveniency of man and all living things; thro' which its winged ten|nants the fowls, fly &s;peedily from danger, or &s;eek their food; and how well fitted to their element, are the form, and lightne&s;s of their bodies.</P>
<P>THE air and water are adapted to promote a friendly intercour&s;e among all the inhabitants of the earth; and to waft the productions of different climes, for the mutual comfort of mankind. The element of air is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;piration, and without it, all living creatures would cea&s;e their exi&s;|tence. And thro' this medium we receive the rays of light and founds.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;un</HI> is a glorious evidence of the munificence of the Deity. As the repre&s;entative of the goodne&s;s of the Creator, it diffu&s;es life and warmth and glad|ne&s;s, among all the works of God on earth. By the appointment of its Creator. "He cometh out of his chambers in the ea&s;t, and rejoiceth as a &s;trong man to run a race." His con&s;tant pre&s;ence would over|power our &s;en&s;es with light and heat, and therefore he withdraws gradually every day, and leaves us to the calm &s;ilence of the night, that our natures may have opportunity to re&s;t from the labours and fatigues of the day, and recruit their exhau&s;ted &s;pi|rits. That we may not be oppre&s;&s;ed with total darkne&s;s in his ab&s;ence, the mild moon and twink|ling &s;tars, &s;hed upon us their cheering light.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028999_0036_0FDDCFFD9D151180">
THE earth is a ma&s;s of lifele&s;s matter. It cannot will or move, and could not give it&s;elf exi&s;tence. But <HI>man</HI> is him&s;elf, a world of wonders in miniature, proclaiming the author divine. "We are fearfully and wonderfully made." What wonders of divine &s;kill appear in the organization of every member of the human body! It is not my de&s;ign, were I capa|ble of it, to di&s;cant anatomically on the various ad|mirable properties of this animated machine; or to point out the nice arrangement, &s;ymmetry, mutual depences and connection of all its organs, limbs and members. I &s;hall notice only a few particulars, to excite our devout gratitude and prai&s;e to God, who made us.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>erect form</HI> which is given to man, &s;trikes us with plea&s;ing admiration, and &s;hews the &s;uperio|rity given to man, over the bea&s;ts of the earth, who are prone to the ground. The <HI>feet,</HI> the &s;upporters of the body, are curiou&s;ly wrought as with ela&s;tic &s;prings, to help forward its motion, and &s;upport in their &s;ockets its weight. The <HI>head</HI> rai&s;ed aloft, and by its po&s;ition and defence mo&s;t out of danger, contains the curious organs of &s;en&s;ation, and the brain the &s;eat of intelligence, &s;trongly guarded by a helmet of bone. The <HI>eyes</HI> are endowed with a power to look up on the heavens, and contemplate the works of God. Strange that this liquid ball, which contains but a few drops of water, &s;hould be able to take in a world of objects, and mea&s;ure their di&s;tances and magnitudes. The <HI>ear</HI> receives and di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ounds, and the <HI>tongue</HI> utters &s;peech, the true images of the thoughts and emotions of the mind. Whence have the&s;e little organs the&s;e ama|zing powers? It is God who gives the eye to &s;ee, the ear to hear, the tongue to &s;peak. The <HI>knees</HI> bend forward to teach man to pro&s;trate him&s;elf in
<PB N="40" REF="028999_0037_0FDDCFFF5949A9D0">humble adoration; the <HI>arms</HI> endowed with a circu|lar motion, to ri&s;e with the thoughts in devout ad|miration to the creator, and well adapted to all the various purpo&s;es of life and motion. Tho' our limbs and &s;en&s;es are obedient to the will, and &s;eem to move and act by a &s;imple volition; yet there is a life within us which acts without our volition, and independent on us; that is, the con&s;tant motion of the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>bowels,</HI> and the &s;urprizing circulation of the <HI>blood,</HI> thro' all the &s;malle&s;t veins. What power, but the power of God, keeps alive, and in motion within us, this ma&s;s of fluid and fle&s;hly &s;ub|&s;tance? It lives and moves by his con&s;tant agency. Taken out of the body, it is in a moment dead, and motionle&s;s as a &s;tone. "In God we live and move and breathe." Let our bodies with all their powers be con&s;ecrated to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. STILL more &s;urprizing wonders &s;trike us, in the contemplation of the rational <HI>&s;oul,</HI> my&s;teriou&s;ly united to, and operating with the body. We find an exi&s;tence within us, hidden from our &s;ight and &s;en&s;es, endowed with the power of thought, reflecti|on, and judgement, which can recal pa&s;t times and tran&s;actions, and &s;end forward its thoughts to ages to come; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a capacity to know the will of God,&mdash;with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the de&s;ert of moral conduct; that feels inward approbation and peace, at good and right conduct, and &s;elf condemnation and blame on doing ill; that has a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de|pendence on God, and obligations to plea&s;e him; that hopes for his favour as the greate&s;t happine&s;s, and dreads his di&s;plea&s;ure, as the greate&s;t calamity. From whence do we derive tho&s;e two natures, &s;o differently con&s;tituted, and yet &s;o nearly connected, and mutually operating, with all the wonderous and enexplicable powers of each, but from him who is
<PB N="41" REF="028999_0038_0FDDD00535301AA8">emphatically the "former of our bodies and the fa|ther of our &s;pirits?" I am con&s;cious of my own ex|i&s;tence, but I know that neither my&s;elf, nor any crea|ture could give it, and thence infer that God exi&s;ts, from whom I derived my being, and by who&s;e con|&s;tant agency I am pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE maje&s;tic oak &s;pringing from the tender acorn &mdash;each &s;pire of gra&s;s, and drop of water&mdash;the &s;mal|le&s;t in&s;ect, and the light atom, which floats in the beams of the &s;un, and each creature and thing in the univer&s;e, as to their e&s;&s;ence and properties, contain my&s;teries, which baffle the &s;tudious inve&s;tigation of the brighte&s;t genius. Creation thro' all her works proclaims a God.</P>
<P>WE infer the exi&s;tence of God from his works. To trace effects to their cau&s;e, in the language of logicians, is rea&s;oning <HI>a po&s;teriori.</HI> And altho' other more ab&s;tract modes of rea&s;oning might be u&s;ed to illu&s;trate this great truth, yet this method is cho&s;en becau&s;e mo&s;t obvious and intelligible, and &s;ufficient to afford compleat &s;atisfaction to every mind. And this method infinite wi&s;dom has cho&s;en for univer&s;al in&s;truction. The heavens and the earth, and every creature is, as an open volume, in which the being and perfections of God are &s;een and under&s;tood. All things are full of him. The evidences of the exi&s;tence and perfections of God, from the works of creation and providence, are calculated to fill our minds with devout affections, with admiration, grati|tude, filial fear and love, rather than to gratify our curious &s;peculation. Yet mu&s;t we &s;trive to obtain the excellent knowledge of God, that we may &s;erve him acceptably. To us who are favored with the &s;uperior light of revelation, it may &s;eem &s;trange that mankind in all ages, &s;hould have gone into
<PB N="42" REF="028999_0039_0FDDD006D71B3110">the belief and wor&s;hip of more Gods than one, &s;ince the doctrine of one almighty Creator, is &s;o clearly demon&s;trated, by the works of creation and provi|dence. An in&s;pired apo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le gives a &s;olution to this, and acquaints us, that the guilt of polythei&s;m origi|nated in the depravity of the human heart. That its vicious propen&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es and lu&s;ts over powered the dictates of rea&s;on. That mankind loved not the character of the true God, as di&s;covered in his works, and therefore formed to them&s;elves imagi|nary Gods, &s;uited to their own depraved inclinations. "They were without excu&s;e, becau&s;e that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their im|aginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkened. They changed the glory of the incorruptable God, into an image, and the truth of God into a lie, and wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the creature, more than the Creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed forever."</P>
<P>IT &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that altho' many Gods were wor&s;hipped before the coming of Chri&s;t, yet &s;ome of the wi&s;e men among the nations, who &s;tudied more attentively the works of God, believed in the unity of the Deity. Plato among the Greeks profe&s;&s;ed this, and his di&s;ciple Socrates, was put to death for teaching the doctrine of one God. But the faith of Philo&s;ophers was weak, becau&s;e they had not the po&s;itive declarations of revelation: and however well they thought and wrote, yet generally went into the abominable idolatries of their country|men.</P>
<P>SOME have al&s;o thought that a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the book of Gene&s;es, might orig|inate in early ages, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otion of a plurality of Gods. In the fir&s;t &s;entence in the bible, there is an intima|tion
<PB N="43" REF="028999_0040_0FDDD00834BB4098">of divine per&s;onalities, in &s;ocial union in Deity.</P>
<P>"In the beginning, Elohim (gods in the plural number) created the heaven and the earth." But the verb <HI>created</HI> being in the &s;ingular, &s;hews that the divine per&s;onalities are, tho' incomprehen&s;ible by us, united in one God. The &s;ame thing is ob&s;ervable in the account of the creation of man; "Let <HI>us</HI> make man, in <HI>our</HI> image, after <HI>our</HI> likene&s;s." And on the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; "Behold the man is become as one of <HI>us.</HI>" And al&s;o at the building of Babal; "Let <HI>us</HI> go down, and there confound their language." If this mode of &s;peech, is not to be under&s;tood agree|ably to the cu&s;tom of ea&s;tern monarchs, who com|monly u&s;ed the plural for the &s;ingular number; we have then in the beginning of the &s;acred volume, a faint intimation of the doctrine of the trinity; a doctrine more fully a&s;&s;erted and explained in the new te&s;tament. Divine revelation abundantly con|firms the inference drawn from the uniform and per|fect works of creation and providence, that there is but one God. "The Gods of the heathen, are vanity and a lie. There is none that can deliver out of my hand; I have made the earth and created man upon it; I, even my hands have &s;tretched out the heavens; I am the Lord who maketh all things; be&s;ides me there is no God. Who," in the &s;u|blime &s;tyle of in&s;piration, "&s;tretched out the hea|vens as a curtain, who laid the beams of his cham|bers in the waters, and maketh the clouds his char|iot; who laid the foundations of the earth that it &s;hould not be removed forever; who covereth it with the deep as with a garment; who cau&s;es the gra&s;s to grow for the cattle, and herb for the &s;ervice of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man

<P>THUS have we taken into con&s;ideration, &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious and &s;atisfactory evidences of the exi&s;tence and perfections of God. I &s;hall conclude this important divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, with one or two</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reflections">
<HEAD>REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. IF, &s;irs, any thing in the works and ways of God, in creation or providence, &s;hould at any time appear to our limited under&s;tanding, incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, let us reject the thought; becau&s;e it originates in our blindne&s;s, and total incapacity to comprehend the works and plans of infinite perfection, rectitude and goodne&s;s. Let us not impiou&s;ly arraign the proceedings of infinite wi&s;dom at the bar of human rea&s;on and folly; but with filial confidence and joy, in the darke&s;t di&s;pen|&s;ations, let us re&s;ort to that univer&s;al truth, taught in the volumes of nature and revelation, <HI>That the Creator and Judge of all worlds does right.</HI> For all that God has done, or will do, is infinitely wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t. And tho' clouds and darkne&s;s may be round about him, unerring judgement and goodne&s;s, are the &s;tability of his works and government.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE ways by which God is plea&s;ed to reveal to us the knowledge of him&s;elf, are divinely excel|lent
<PB N="45" REF="028999_0042_0FDDD00F181924C8">and various. Let them be the profitable and plea&s;ing &s;ubjects of our con&s;tant and prayerful &s;tudy and meditation. The heavens declare his glorious greatne&s;s, and the earth is full of his goodne&s;s. But in the revelation of his holy law and go&s;pel, "we read his name in fairer lines." Let us &s;ee God in all his works, and may our minds be filled with a plea&s;ing and awful &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence: who&s;e pre|&s;ence &s;urrounds us and pervades our e&s;&s;ence. Let us &s;trive to obtain a knowledge of the nature and perfections, the works of laws, of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God; for the knowledge of him, con&s;titutes the happine&s;s and joy of angels, and all holy intelligen|ces. Let us &s;eek the favour and protection of this almighty being, in who&s;e favour is our life. The maje&s;ty of God, as di&s;played in his works, have a tendency to impre&s;s our minds with a &s;uitable hum|ble &s;en&s;e of our littlene&s;s, and unworthy of his mer|cies. "When I look up to the heavens and con&s;id|er them as the work of thy hands, Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him;" that thou vi|&s;ite&s;ts him every morning, and trie&s;t him every mo|ment! But the contemplation of the frame of the univer&s;e, and all the wonders of creation, cannot give the &s;oul a &s;aving knowledge of the ble&s;&s;ed Cre|ator. It is the office of the divine &s;pirit to remove our darkne&s;s, and &s;o reveal to us the father, in the attractions of his love and mercy, in the Saviour, as to give us a title to the inheritance of eternal life. And to every penitent enquirer after God, this &s;aving knowledge and grace are given. "O Thou great and ever ble&s;&s;ed Jehovah, who at the beginning did&s;t command the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s; who in thy &s;overeign power and goodne&s;s did&s;t &s;ay, let there be light, and there was light, &s;hine into our benighted hearts, and give us to di&s;cover thy amia|ble and awful glories, as they are revealed in the

<P>I AM now,</P>
<P N="2">II. To invite your attention to this great truth and duty,&mdash;<HI>That God is the alone object of our religious wor&s;hip.</HI> The command, that we &s;hall <HI>have</HI> no other God before Jehovah, is very expre&s;&s;ive, and implies that we mu&s;t <HI>have</HI> a God; and that our God mu&s;t be the only living and true God; and that no creature or thing &s;hould be prefered or e&s;teemed equally, or worthy to be compared to him, as the chiefe&s;t object of our knowledge, of our &s;upreme love, homage and obedience.</P>
<P>THIS precept is placed the fir&s;t of God's laws to man, to teach us the object to whom our thoughts are fir&s;t to be directed, to whom our powers are to be forever con&s;ecrated, and who&s;e will is our only &s;ufficient rule of duty and felicity.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD is the &s;upreme object of our religious homage and wor&s;hip, becau&s;e he is the only true God. To us there is but one God, the father of all. "The Gods of the heathen are vanity and a
<PB N="48" REF="028999_0045_0FDDD01814885130">lie; the work of men's hands, and of their vain im|aginations. As God alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all po&s;&s;ible per|fection, infinite in power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; the fir&s;t, the greate&s;t and be&s;t, and only &s;ource of all being, perfection and happine&s;s, he is alone worthy of the profounde&s;t homage, wor&s;hip and love of his creatures. Whatever of goodne&s;s, u&s;efulne&s;s or happine&s;s are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound among the works of creation, are derived from God, the &s;ource of all good. We form &s;ome imperfect idea of God, by combining in our imagination, all tho&s;e excellencies and perfec|tions, which we di&s;cover among creatures, and attribute them to him, and conceive of them as exi&s;ting in him in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, of which our thoughts are capable. But alas, how poor and imperfect are our be&s;t thoughts of God! They fall infinitely below the heighth of his exalted nature and character; for the being and perfections of God are incomprehen&s;ible by finite minds. It is high we cannot attain unto it. "God is in heaven and we are on earth." As heaven is high above the earth, &s;o are his nature and attributes and ways far above our thoughts. It is but a &s;mall portion of his character, which we can know. The wonders of his being, eternal, &s;elf-exi&s;ting, underived, and his adorable attributes, works and government, will forever afford to holy beings, a &s;till enlarging and extending field of knowledge, admiration and prai&s;e, thro' all eternal ages. As religious wor&s;hip implies the intire con&s;ecration of our&s;elves to the being whom we wor&s;hip; that our be&s;t hopes and tru&s;t and love, our life and time and &s;ervices be wholly and forever dedicated to him, we hence infer that none but God alone is the proper object of the&s;e; &s;ince he alone is the &s;ource of all being and perfection.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is the object of our religious wor&s;hip, becau&s;e we are entirely dependent on him. We
<PB N="49" REF="028999_0046_0FDDD0181A64CE30">are his ab&s;olute property, by right of creation, and con&s;tant pre&s;ervation. No &s;ervant is &s;o dependent on his ma&s;ter, or child on its parent for bread, as every creature is dependent on God, the univer&s;al proprietor. It was his goodne&s;s which gave us ex|i&s;tence. His infinite happine&s;s could receive no acce&s;&s;ion from creatures. As we are dependent on God for the exi&s;tence which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and for all the rich and various provi&s;ion made for our tem|poral comfort, on his unmerited bounty and mercy, we depend for all our hopes of future and immortal life and happine&s;s, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. By who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed mediation, our exi&s;tence was redeem|ed from the &s;entence of death, and a new &s;tate of trial allowed us, that by repentance before God, and a living principle of faith in the almighty re|deemer, producing the holy fruits of obedience, we may obtain, thro' the mercy of God, the inheritance of immortal life. Thus our &s;upreme love, homage and obedience to God are demanded, by the right of creation, pre&s;ervation and redemption.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD demands our exclu&s;ive wor&s;hip, becau&s;e he will not &s;uffer a rival in our hearts. We mu&s;t have none before, or be&s;ides him. He will not allow us to give that honor and homage to another. His fir&s;t law to man demands our whole heart. "Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;" with all our powers, our bodies and our &s;pirits, which are his. "Take heed to your&s;elves that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn a&s;ide, and &s;erve other Gods and wor&s;hip them." They vio|late this holy commandment, who love life, or the world and the goods and enjoyments thereof, more than God. We come,</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;peak of the nature and guilt of Idolatry. As mankind are naturally inclined to depart from
<PB N="50" REF="028999_0047_0FDDD01A444093C8">the knowledge and wor&s;hip of God, he is plea&s;ed to caution and guard us again&s;t this &s;in, by prohibiting in this fir&s;t precept our having any other, as the object of our &s;upreme love and obedience; or paying tho&s;e divine honors to any other, which are due to him. Idolatry is loving and &s;erving any creature more than God. This &s;in may be con&s;ider|ed in a threefold view. As,

<ITEM>III. WHEN our love and dependence are placed upon creatures, to the neglect of God.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind of idolatry. And it is this kind of idolatry which almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevailed in early ages. The Baby|lonians appear to be the fir&s;t who gave the lead to this kind of wor&s;hip; and &s;et up temples, and erected images in them; paid divine honors to many fal&s;e and imaginary gods. From them it &s;pread into Egypt, and other parts of the world. The &s;en&s;ual ta&s;te of men cho&s;e gods whom they could &s;ee, and fir&s;t began to pay divine wor&s;hip to tho&s;e creatures and things, which were mo&s;t benefi|cial. Hence originated the wor&s;hip of the &s;un, moon and planets; and this idolatry was common in almo&s;t all the ea&s;t, e&s;pecially the wor&s;hip of the &s;un. For this is the mo&s;t glorious repre&s;entative of the power and goodne&s;s of the Creator, of all his works, and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial to mankind. The wor&s;hip of this glorious luminary, was the mo&s;t excu&s;able kind of idolatry, (if any excu&s;e may be admitted in the ca&s;e) of all the idolatrous rites of the
<PB N="51" REF="028999_0048_0FDDD01BB5D451B8">heathen, &s;ince it is the brighte&s;t emblem of the Deity, among things created.

<L>'Twere &s;in in heathen, not to have ador'd.</L>
<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> But it is no more then one of the works of God, and men are mo&s;t inex|cu&s;ible, in giving tho&s;e divine honors to a creature, which the light of nature taught them were due, only to the Creator.</P>
<P>THE I&s;raelites, in the reign of impious and vici|ous kings, fell into the idolatrous practices of neigh|bouring nations. They erected magnificent tem|ples, and con&s;ecrated groves and hor&s;es and chariots, to the &s;un and moon, to the planets, and all the ho&s;ts of heaven. A malicious and cruel deity Moloch, was wor&s;hipped, by offering living children in &s;acrifice. The fal&s;e gods of the nations, the &s;criptures condemn, by the name of <HI>abominations.</HI> Thus we read of A&s;taroth, the abominations of the Zidonians,&mdash;Chemo&s;h, the abomination of the Moabites,&mdash;Milcom of the Ammonites,&mdash;Dagon of the Phili&s;tines,&mdash;Baal, the abomination of the Syrians.</P>
<P>IDOL gods were exceedingly multiplied. Every nation had its principal god, and each province, town and family, its &s;ubordinate, tutelary deity. And in the days of Mo&s;es, the earth was overrun with this &s;tupid and profane abomination. And the effect of idolatry, was the prevalence of all manner of vice. For&s;aking the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the true God, there was nothing to re&s;train the pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts of the human heart. Forming gods to their own depraved ta&s;te, they imagined that they mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with &s;uch licentious ways, as were plea&s;ing to them&s;elves. Filthy rites were performed, in
<PB N="52" REF="028999_0049_0FDDD0211C1DA5A8">honor of their la&s;civious gods and godde&s;&s;es. Vir|gins were pro&s;tituted in their temples; and the God of intemperence and of lu&s;t, wor&s;hipped in a manner &s;uited to their characters, and all manner of bea&s;tly vices prevailed. The condemnation of the &s;in of idolatry, is therefore placed at the beginning of the moral law, as the greate&s;t &s;in of which mankind can be guilty. Idolatry prevailed not only among the mo&s;t ignorant, but the mo&s;t learned nations. The Egyptions were celebrated for political wi&s;dom and human &s;cience, yet were mo&s;t addicted to this gro&s;s and impious &s;uper&s;tition, and exceeded all nations in the number and meanne&s;s of their gods. They wor&s;hipped a living calf, in magnificent temples, as their chief god; and paid divine honors to cats and crocodiles, and other vile animals, and even to the vegetables which grew in their gardens, and devoured the gods whom they adored. O &s;acred folly, and blind impiety! Left to the guidance of depraved pa&s;&s;ions and propen&s;ities, how fruitful is the heart of man, in eva&s;ions to loo&s;e the knowledge and reject the wor&s;hip of the one only high and holy God, the former of all things!</P>
<P N="2">II. ANOTHER &s;pecies of idolatry is, wor&s;hipping God by images, &s;ymbols, or vi&s;ible repre&s;entations. God is a &s;pirit; he is not comprehended by our &s;en&s;es. Altho' the works of creation and provi|dence, and the word of God, proclaim his being and perfections, yet we &s;ee not God with our bodily &s;ight. But men have invented images, figures and pictures to repre&s;ent the invi&s;ible Jehovah, and wor&s;hipped them. The difference between this kind of idolatry and that ju&s;t mentioned is, that this profe&s;&s;es to wor&s;hip the true God in the image, the other wor&s;hips an image, to the exclu&s;ion of the true God. One is the wor&s;hip of &s;ome creature in&s;tead
<PB N="53" REF="028999_0050_0FDDD02275F5B0B0">of God, the other is the wor&s;hip of God in or with a creature. This branch of Pagan idolatry has been revived and practiced, many ages, in the church of Rome, There they pay divine honors to the bread and wine in the euchari&s;ts, ab&s;urdly imagining that tho&s;e elements are converted into the real body and blood of Chri&s;t. They wor&s;hip the &s;uppo&s;ed wood of the cro&s;s and numerous relicks; the images of angels, &s;aints, apo&s;tles and the virgin Mary. Tho' they alledge that they wor&s;hip not the images, but the holy beings repre&s;ented by them, yet this wor|&s;hip, according to their own ju&s;tification of it, is ex|pre&s;sly and &s;everely prohibited, both in the fir&s;t and &s;econd precepts of the law. But as this branch of idolatry will with greater propriety come into con&s;i|deration under the next precept, I &s;hall not anticipate it, but conclude this divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, with &s;hewing the folly, guilt and mi&s;ery, of the idolatry here condemned.</P>
<P>To us it may well appear &s;trange, that mankind &s;hould &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;take the object of religious wor|&s;hip, and loo&s;e the knowledge of God, and pay tho&s;e divine honors to creatures, which are to God.&mdash; They were &s;incere in their wor&s;hip; they confided in the power of idol gods to help them, in times of trouble. How fervent were the wor&s;hippers of Baal, in the days of Elijah! But &s;ince God has given to mankind in all ages &s;uch clear evidences of his being and perfections, can we wonder at the manife&s;tations of his wrath again&s;t idolaters, that he &s;hould, and in righteous judgment, withdraw from them, his re&s;training and &s;aving grace; and give them up to reprobation, and to work all kinds of wickedne&s;s with greedine&s;s, and thus ripen them&s;elves for an aggravated condemnation. Such idolaters &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light, choo&s;ing darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="028999_0051_0FDDD02490600C10">
As idolatry is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t &s;in of which mankind can be guilty; God has inflicted on gro&s;s idolaters, the &s;evere&s;t &s;piritual judgments; as St. Paul ob&s;erves was the ca&s;e with the pagan world. "Who, becau&s;e when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was dark|ened, and changed the glory of the incorruptable God, into an image made like to corruptable man, and to birds, and four footed bea&s;ts and creeping things; wherefore God al&s;o gave them up to un|cleanne&s;s, thro' the lu&s;ts of their own hearts, to di&s;|honor their own bodies between them&s;elves, who changed the truth of God into a lie, and wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the creature, more than the creator, who is ble&s;&s;ed forever. For this cau&s;e God gave them up to the vile affections;&mdash;and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind; being filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;hateful, and hating one another."</P>
<P>WE come la&s;tly, to &s;peak of a &s;pecies of idolatry different from tho&s;e now mentioned; an idolatry alas, but too common at the pre&s;ent day, and of which we are all no doubt, in a greater or le&s;s degree chargable; it is a <HI>&s;piritual idolatry,</HI> in which the mind and affections are placed on the world, and the things of the world, as the chief good and happine&s;s of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;ecret kind of idolatry, oft times &s;o hid|den, as not to be di&s;cerned by our&s;elves, and much le&s;s by others. An evil that mixes it&s;elf with our daily labors,&mdash;with our relative and &s;ocial duties, with our religious profe&s;&s;ions, and devotional exer|ci&s;es. For if God is not con&s;tantly and forever the
<PB N="55" REF="028999_0052_0FDDD02AD34F8EC8">chief object of our love, our de&s;ire, our tru&s;t, our hope and our happine&s;s; our hearts are not right, and we are chargable with the &s;in of loving and &s;erv|ing our&s;elves, or the creature, more than we ought, and are guilty of &s;piritual idolatry. God as the fir&s;t and greate&s;t being, demands our &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me love and obedience; if then,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;trive to plea&s;e, or fear to offend, any creature though the mo&s;t powerful, created being, more than to plea&s;e God, his holy law condemns us therein, for he is higher than the highe&s;t and de|mands our highe&s;t regard. No creature or thing ought to command our highe&s;t and mo&s;t profound obedience, love and fear. The&s;e &s;hould ever have God for their object. "Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul, but fear him who is able to de&s;troy, both body and &s;oul in hell."</P>
<P>GOD is the &s;overeign Creator and proprietor of us and all things, and we cannot be under equal obli|gations to any other, and therefore, &s;hould fear, &s;erve and obey him, fir&s;t and before all others.</P>
<P>WE are con&s;tantly in the pre&s;ence of Jehovah, our &s;overeign Creator and merciful redeemer, and ought ever to bear on our minds, a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence, and of our obligations, and depen|dence; and if we love, e&s;teem, or reverence any creature, more than God at any time, we offend, and are chargable with idolatry.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are al&s;o guilty of idolatry, when we love our&s;elves &s;upremely; when <HI>&s;elf</HI> is the object that we &s;eek principly to &s;erve and plea&s;e. God was the &s;upreme object of man's love and complacency, at
<PB N="56" REF="028999_0053_0FDDD02D1AAE3EF8">the creation, but at the fall, the deity was dethoned from the human heart, and the idol &s;elf, was &s;et up as the chief object of love and complacency; &s;o that now in his fallen &s;tate, man is a "lover of him&s;elf, more than a lover of God." Divine grace dethrones this idol, and re&s;tores the &s;oul to God. How great and offen&s;ive mu&s;t this &s;in be in the &s;ight of God, that the creature &s;hould prefer him&s;elf to God, and &s;erve and plea&s;e him&s;elf, tho' a worthle&s;s, offending, helple&s;s creature rather than God, the ble&s;&s;ed crea|tor?</P>
<P>THIS &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;inner, would incline him, to bring the whole Univer&s;e to his will and plea&s;ure, &s;ince his own intere&s;t and happine&s;s is the chief object of his wi&s;hes and de&s;ires; yea, he would make the deity &s;ub&s;ervient to his will and plea&s;ure, had he power, and dethrone the &s;overeign of the Univer&s;e. Dreadful thought! yet mu&s;t this be indeed the &s;tate of the &s;inner, who loves him&s;elf more than God. What impious idolatry then are all they chargable with, in who&s;e heart true love to God, is not found?</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is idolatry to love the world more than God. To pur&s;ue after the wealth, the honors and plea&s;ures thereof, as the chief good and happine&s;s, is vile idolatry. It is placing this peri&s;hable world and the goods of it in the place of God. It is making provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof, and &s;erving mammon the God of this world, with the be&s;t affections. The apo&s;tle con|demns covetou&s;ne&s;s as idolatry. The lover of this world's goods, placing his affections &s;upremely upon them, and pur&s;uing them as his highe&s;t happine&s;s, in the &s;ight of God, is no doubt as guilty of idola|try, as the pagan, who wor&s;hips the &s;un or the moon,
<PB N="57" REF="028999_0054_0FDDD02E77C8F1E0">yea, the pagan is le&s;s criminal, becau&s;e the object is more worthy.</P>
<P>How many then are guilty of the &s;in of idolatry, and of having other gods, be&s;ides the only true Je|hovah? All tho&s;e who are depending on any thing &s;hort of Chri&s;t for &s;alvation, or a &s;incere repentance, and for&s;aking of their &s;ins, and a humble and cordial reliance on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;aviour, are &s;etting up a &s;aviour of their own, in oppo&s;ition to God, and &s;o are chargable with the &s;in of idolatry. All tho&s;e who reject the revelation of the divine will, teaching men the way of duty and happine&s;s, and profe&s;s to take their &s;canty rea&s;on, and their inter|pretation of the law of nature as their guide to hap|pine&s;s, &s;et up their own will in oppo&s;ition to the will of God revealed in the go&s;pel of his &s;on, and are guilty of idolatry. In a word, all tho&s;e who love not God &s;upremely, and delight to honor, &s;erve and obey him, fall under the condemnation of this fir&s;t great law of our rational nature.</P>
<P>SOME REFLECTIONS on this &s;ubject will con|clude.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are taught that God alone is the &s;upreme object of our religious wor&s;hip, love and obedience. Let us &s;trive to know, wor&s;hip, and &s;erve no other God. He is the infinite Jehovah, who has given us life and being, in who&s;e hands are all our ways; who has given us his &s;on, "the brightne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on," to enlighten and &s;anctify us, and to redeem us from all our woes, and rai&s;e us to immortal felicity.</P>
<P>WHAT obligations are we under for &s;uch infinite kindne&s;s, &s;hewn even to the evil, and unthankful?
<PB N="58" REF="028999_0055_0FDDD02FF538CD38">If infinite excellence,&mdash;if almighty power,&mdash;if un|bounded goodne&s;s, and &s;potle&s;s purity and perfec|tion, are worthy our &s;upreme love and obedience, then do we owe them to God. If we derive our being from God,&mdash;if his con&s;tant and merciful providence continually &s;upplies our wants,&mdash;if when we had fallen, and become liable to &s;uffer the pains of endle&s;s puni&s;hment, his mercy interpo&s;ed, and laid help on one mighty to &s;ave; if it is the will of God that none of us &s;hould peri&s;h, but that we all might inherit eternal life; and rich provi&s;ion is now made for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we hence infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that we ought to love, &s;erve, wor&s;hip, obey and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;e God, for this has his unmerited love and grace, &s;hewn to us.

<P N="2">II. WE hence infer our obligations to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' whom there is acce&s;s to God, even the father. By his ble&s;&s;ed mediation, he hath brought about reconciliation; thro' whom with humble boldne&s;s, and filial confidence, we may approach the throne of grace, and implore grace to help us, in every time of need. Divine honors belong to the &s;on; and it is no idolatry to wor&s;hip him, for he is one with the father, whom the holy angels wor&s;hip, and who received divine wor&s;hip from men, even when he conde&s;cended to call him|&s;elf the &s;on of man.</P>
<P>WHEN none of the &s;ons of the mighty, none of tho&s;e morning &s;tars, the holy angels, the &s;ons of God by adoption, were equal to the arduous work of man's redemption, it plea&s;ed the uncreated and eternal &s;on of the father, to veil his glories in

<P>IN our unrenewed and unholy &s;tate by nature, we cannot wor&s;hip God acceptably. A new heart mu&s;t be given us, and a new &s;pirit put within us, would we have God for our God, and acceptably &s;erve him.</P>
<P>As nece&s;&s;ary to this, the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour exhorts us to repentance for &s;in, and conver|&s;ion to God, which con&s;i&s;ts in the heart: turning from all idols, to the love, the wor&s;hip, and &s;ervice of God. Grace makes a great change in the mind, breaking it off from a &s;inful conformity to this world, and transforming us into a re&s;emblance of Chri&s;t, enlightning us into the knowledge of God, and inclining us to keep his laws with all our heart.</P>
<P>THAT wor&s;hip, &s;irs, that God demands of us is &s;piritual, it is the wor&s;hip, love and obedience of the &s;oul. The Lord &s;earcheth the heart, he demands truth and &s;incerity there. "The &s;acrifice of the Lord are a broken &s;pirit," a heart humble,
<PB N="60" REF="028999_0057_0FDDD036B8AC2208">holy, teachable and heavenly. Without this, the external obedience that we pay in outward forms of wor&s;hip, are of no avail. "For bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little, but godline&s;s is profitable unto all things," having the promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Let us not "draw nigh to him in profe&s;&s;ion, while our hearts are far from him."</P>
<P>LET us oft repair to the throne of grace, for the true wor&s;hipper of God, and ob&s;erver of his law, will be much in prayer, con&s;cious of his own blind|ne&s;s in &s;piritual things, he will come to the foun|tain of light, that the eyes of his under&s;tanding being enlightened, "he may know and approve, what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of the Lord. And if any man lack wi&s;dom, let him, a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not."</P>
<P N="4">IV. WE learn the unhappy and dangerous condi|tion of tho&s;e who are ignorant of God; "who live without God in the world." We read of the wicked, that "God is not in all their thoughts," or in any of them. Their condition in the future world will be mi&s;erable beyond conception; for the &s;upreme Judge of the world will condemn tho&s;e "who know not God, to everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the pre|&s;ence of the Lord." There can be no &s;aving know|ledge of God, but thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;on. "For this is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent." They who&s;e minds are conformed to the law of God, and to the go&s;pel of his &s;on, who renounce ungodli|ne&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, will thro' the grace and mercy of God in Chri&s;t, be admitted to eternal life.</P>

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable in the pages of in&s;piration, as was &s;ugge&s;ted in a preceding di&s;cour&s;e, that when a &s;in or vice is forbidden, the oppo&s;ite virtue or duty is commanded, tho' it may not be expre&s;sly mentioned. That this is the ca&s;e with the precepts of this divine law, is manife&s;t by the rea&s;on of things, the tenor of revelation, and by the expo|&s;ition given of them, by our infallible teacher, who came to fulfil the law, as recorded by the evangeli&s;t Matthew. Thus the prohibition of
<PB N="64" REF="028999_0060_0FDDD04075179550">fal&s;e gods in the fir&s;t precept, as forcibly obliges us to know, wor&s;hip (love and obey the true God, as it condemns our tru&s;ting in, or wor&s;hipping fal&s;e gods; and in the &s;econd, the prohibition of wor&s;hipping God by images, requires that we wor&s;hip him agreeably to his holy and &s;piritual nature. This precept bears a near re&s;emblance to the fir&s;t. The difference is, that the fir&s;t teaches us that God is the alone rightful <HI>object</HI> of our wor&s;hip, and that this glory he will not allow us to give to any other; and the &s;econd teaches us, the <HI>manner</HI> in which we are to wor&s;hip and &s;erve him. God forbids us to wor&s;hip him by images, figures, &s;tatutes, pictures, or any vi&s;ible re&s;emblance of the works of nature or art; for nothing can be made or formed, worthily to repre&s;ent the infinite and immen&s;e Jehovah, the eternal and invi&s;ible &s;pirit. We are hence to infer that God is to be wor&s;hipped by our &s;pirits, as well as externally. For the law demanding our obedi|ence, is &s;piritual, extending to the exerci&s;es of the heart, demanding truth and &s;incerity there. "God is a &s;pirit, and the true wor&s;hippers, wor&s;hip the father in &s;pirit and in truth." It is proper for us to notice the wi&s;dom of the &s;upreme lawgiver, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">angement of the precepts. The mo&s;t &s;olemn and important are fir&s;t delivered. The greate&s;t &s;in of which mankind can be guilty, is fir&s;t forbidden; the &s;in of having a fal&s;e god, in whom to place our tru&s;t; and the fir&s;t and greate&s;t duty and felicity of rational creatures required, which is our having the true God for our God, our portion and happine&s;s. The next greate&s;t duty is to wor&s;hip and &s;erve the true God acceptably; and the next greate&s;t &s;in, is dividing our wor&s;hip, love and obedience between God and creatures, or wor&s;hipping him in or by images. And the &s;in forbidden and duties required in the &s;econd precept, are greater than tho&s;e of the
<PB N="65" REF="028999_0061_0FDDD0420768F518">third, and tho&s;e of the third, than tho&s;e of the fourth. A &s;imilar gradation of relative duties to|wards our fellow men <HI>is ob&s;ervable</HI> in the &s;econd table of this divine law.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. THE rea&s;on given why God &s;hall not be wor|&s;hipped by images, is that no image can repre|&s;ent him. Images are material, local and peri&s;ha|ble; and God is a &s;pirit, eternal, omnipre&s;ent, and incorruptable. Our thoughts are lo&s;t in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m|plation of his immen&s;ity. To form an image of God, is to degrade the glory and dignity of his nature and perfections; and is contrary to his expre&s;s will. All images or figures of the deity, formed either by our imaginations or by the hands of men fall infinitely &s;hort of the divine original, and tend to dive&s;t the mind of tho&s;e pure and &s;ublime concep|tions
<PB N="66" REF="028999_0062_0FDDD0474E0D3E88">which we ought ever to have of God, as a being uncompounded, invi&s;ible, omnipre&s;ent.&mdash; They are impious attempts to bring down the Deity to the level of our comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER rea&s;on of the prohibition is, the danger of our giving tho&s;e divine honors to the image, rather than to God. And this hath been the ca&s;e. Images were probably fir&s;t invented, that the minds of men might by them be more &s;olemnly affected with a &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of God. And a&s;&s;ociating in their idea, the &s;pecial pre&s;ence of God in the image, they imperceptably fell into the wor|&s;hip of the image it&s;elf, as God, or the &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entative of &s;ome of his attributes.</P>
<P>THE heathen have fixed upon various objects or images, becau&s;e of &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed likene&s;s in them, to him whom they profe&s;&s;ed to wor&s;hip. U&s;ing the&s;e to excite their devotion they have by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition gone on to wor&s;hip the image with God, and finally to terminate their wor&s;hip on the &s;en&s;ele&s;s object. Thus pagans in former times, and papi&s;ts at the pre&s;ent day, bow down to images and figures of the Deity. The Grecians and Romans wor&s;hip|ped the &s;upreme being, in the image and name of Jupiter, and al&s;o various &s;ubordinate deities, as repre&s;entatives of the providences and perfections of God, or as appointed to pre&s;ide over the affairs and the employments of men, in different parts of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>WE have a remarkable in&s;tance of this &s;en&s;ele&s;s wor&s;hip of images, even among the learned Ephe|&s;ians, in the days of the apo&s;tles. Demetrius, a zealous idolater, accu&s;ed the apo&s;tle, "&s;aying, this Paul hath per&s;uaded and turned away much people,
<PB N="67" REF="028999_0063_0FDDD048B78A1BF0">&s;aying that they be no gods which are made with hands,&mdash;&s;o that the great godde&s;s Diana is in danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed, whom all A&s;ia, and the world wor&s;hippeth. And they cried out, for the &s;pace of two hours, great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians,&mdash;what man is there that knoweth not, how that the city of the Ephe&s;ians, is a wor&s;hipper of the great godde&s;s Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?"</P>
<P>OUR Celtie and Saxon ance&s;tors were idolatrous wor&s;hippers of images. They wor&s;hipped the idol <HI>Woden,</HI> the imaginary God of battles, on Wedne&s;|day, (from whom the day derives its name.) And the idol Thor, the god of thunder, on Thur&s;day. And they wor&s;hipped God by images, or deities of their own imagination, for a con&s;iderable time after Chri&s;t came; and were among the la&s;t of the pagan nations, within the bounds of the ancient Roman empire, who renounced the wor&s;hip of idols, and embraced the chri&s;tian faith.</P>
<P>IT is a remarkable fact, confirmed by authentic hi&s;torians, that by the preaching of the apo&s;tles, the idolatrous oracles of the heathen nations, in Europe and A&s;ia, from whence, evil &s;pirits, by the mouths of fal&s;e prophets had i&s;&s;ued orders and predictions, were &s;ilenced and &s;truck dumb; and their temples, &s;oon after were for&s;aken, or converted into churches of Chri&s;t. This was a wonderful di&s;|play of the power of Chri&s;t, over the powers of darkne&s;s, and the accompli&s;hment of one de&s;ign of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, who came to de&s;troy the works and the vi&s;ible wor&s;hip of the devil. A &s;pecimen of this power he had given to his di&s;ciples before his a&s;cen&s;ion, when they returned to Chri&s;t, from
<PB N="68" REF="028999_0064_0FDDD04E86F22320">the mi&s;&s;ion on which he had &s;ent them to preach, rejoicing at the &s;ucce&s;s, "&s;aying Lord, even the devils are &s;ubject to us, thro' thy name."</P>
<P>THE wor&s;hip of invi&s;ible beings by images, however covered with the pretence of honoring God by them, was in reality, the grand in&s;trument by which Satan maintained a vi&s;ible kingdom on earth, ruling in the children of di&s;obedience. But the light of the go&s;pel &s;hone into his dark retreats, and his kingdom fell, as with lightning from heaven. Af|ter &s;everal ages had elap&s;ed, the folly and wickedne&s;s of pagan idolatry was revived in the church of Rome. There they canonize and wor&s;hip dead men, and &s;ome who had been infamous for vice, or had no other merit, but that of being benefactors to the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition. They wor&s;hip the image of the virgin Mary, the apo&s;tles and angels, paying divine honors to them, as protectors and mediators. Thus by degrading the ble&s;&s;ed and only mediator, and by &s;etting up idols and them&s;elves above God; and by the traffic of indulgences in all manner of &s;ins, they have evinced them&s;elves, to be indeed the "mother of abominations, and the antichri&s;t, whom God will de&s;troy, with the brightne&s;s of his appearing."</P>
<P>DEVIATIONS from the pure and &s;piritual law of divine wor&s;hip to the one only true God, are &s;olemn|ly forbidden. <HI>Thou &s;halt not make unto thee, any likene&s;s of any thing that is in heaven above;</HI> either the &s;un, moon, planets or &s;tars, or of birds,&mdash;the idol gods of the Chaldeans and ea&s;tern nations. <HI>Or in the earth beneath;</HI> as dead men, four-footed bea&s;ts, &s;erpents and the like,&mdash;the idol Gods of the Egyp|tians. <HI>Or in the waters under the earth;</HI> as croco|diles and fi&s;hes; the latter was wor&s;hipped by the
<PB N="69" REF="028999_0065_0FDDD04F76862140">Canaanites, and the former by the Egyptians. By this particular prohibition, it plea&s;ed God to guard the ancient church, from the idolatrous ways of &s;urrounding nations. Images are not forbidden, except &s;uch as were de&s;igned as repre&s;entations of &s;piritual things and objects of religious wor&s;hip; as appears by the command to make a brazen &s;erpent, and the figures of Cherubims, and the brazen bulls at the temple built by Solomon. Chri&s;tians are not forbidden to make decent images, &s;tatutes or pic|tures of per&s;ons or things. But any picture or image intended to repre&s;ent the incomprehen&s;ible Jehovah, is at all times prohibited, as impious. As a rea&s;on to enforce the ob&s;ervance of this pre|cept, Mo&s;es reminds the people of I&s;rael, that they &s;aw no manner of &s;imilitude of God at Sinai, and that they only heard a voice, from the mid&s;t of the awful and glorious &s;cene, that covered the mount.</P>
<P>THE prophet Elijah, by a &s;olemn irony, ridi|cules the wor&s;hip of Baal, and their god. The prophet I&s;aiah in the &s;ame &s;train, &s;everely cen&s;ures the folly of idol-wor&s;hip. "The &s;mith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fa&s;hioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the &s;trength of his arms;&mdash;the carpenter &s;tretcheth out his rule, he marketh it with a line, and compa&s;s, and maketh it after the figure of a man. He planteth an a&s;h and the rain doth nouri&s;h it, with part of it he kind|leth a fire, and baketh bread; with part of it he maketh a god, and wor&s;hippeth it; he falleth down before it, and prayeth unto it, and &s;aith deliver me, for thou art my God."</P>
<P>THIS precept forbids us to give that love and de|pendence to any creature which belongs only to God, who is a jealous God, &s;peaking after the man|ner
<PB N="70" REF="028999_0066_0FDDD05166AB71D0">of men, and who will not &s;uffer a rival in our hearts. This command therefore re&s;pects our di&s;|po&s;ition of heart, as well as our external homage, We come,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;peak of the nature and qualities of that true and acceptable wor&s;hip, which God hath ap|pointed. We are to wor&s;hip God &s;piritually, as well as externally, and in a way and manner agreea|bly to his holy nature, and revealed will. No wor&s;hip, can be acceptable to God, but &s;uch as he hath directed. His will di&s;covered by the light of nature, but e&s;pecially by the clearer light of revela|tion, is our only guide, in this intere&s;ting enquiry. Wherewith &s;hall guilty offende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> come acceptably before God, and bow them&s;elves before the Mo&s;t High? is an enquiry, which receives a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, only from the revealed will of God. The wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t heathen were in the dark as to this important matter; and knew not how to approach the holy pre&s;ence of God, with acceptance. But the holy &s;criptures have revealed to us the will of God, and the way of our acceptance by the righteou&s;ne&s;s and mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There we are taught the nece&s;&s;ity of a humble, teachable and re&s;igned &s;pirit, willing to know and practice the will of God. That to wor&s;hip him to acceptance, we mu&s;t renounce all &s;inful lu&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, as &s;en&s;uality, pride, envy, cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s and the love of this world, and that our hearts be pure, &s;incere, and filled with the love of God, and of mankind. And that to wor&s;hip him acceptably, we mu&s;t come in the way of grace revealed in the go&s;pel, expecting audi|ance and acceptance only in the name, and thro' the merits and mediation of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; "He is the way, the truth and the life; and none cometh to the father, but by him."</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="71" REF="028999_0067_0FDDD05669139060">
1. A nece&s;&s;ary qualification of our acceptance with God in our wor&s;hip of him, is a humble &s;en&s;e and confe&s;&s;ion of unworthine&s;s. That of our&s;elves we have not any righteou&s;ne&s;s, goodne&s;s or merit to claim his favourable notice,&mdash;that we are fallen, guilty offenders again&s;t his holy law, and are ju&s;tly condemned to &s;uffer its awful cur&s;es, that the law is holy, ju&s;t and good, but that we are unholy, un|righteous and vile. The important and requi&s;ite qualification of the &s;inners acceptance with God, is a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of unworthine&s;s and a &s;en&s;e of depen|dence on the rich mercy of God in the redeemer.</P>
<Q><L>"Let not con&s;cience make you linger,</L>
<L>"Nor of fitne&s;s fondly dream;</L>
<L>"All the fitne&s;s he requireth,</L>
<L>"Is to feel your need of him."</L></Q>
<P>THE &s;inner before he has this preparation of heart to wor&s;hip God acceptably, may imagine that he has need of nothing, but upon the plan of the covenant of grace, he mu&s;t be indeed convinced that he is poor and mi&s;erable, as to his &s;piritual condition, before he will be di&s;po&s;ed to prize the remedy which grace has provided for the guilty and helple&s;s. He mu&s;t renounce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is own goodne&s;s, as having no merit to ju&s;tify him, and feel his dependence on the divine plan of &s;overeign grace which gives all the glory of his &s;alvation to God. Chri&s;t came, not to call the righteous, or tho&s;e who are righteous in their own apprehen&s;ion, but &s;inners, who are indeed &s;en|&s;ible that they are &s;inners to repentance and &s;alva|tion. But this is a condition which cro&s;&s;es the natural pride of the human heart, and di&s;po&s;es men to re&s;i&s;t the convictions of the divine &s;pirit, and their own &s;alvation. The &s;inner turns from the &s;ight of his own deformity, as &s;een in the gla&s;s of the law, and choo&s;es not to view him&s;elf as a guilty criminal
<PB N="72" REF="028999_0068_0FDDD057B55B3DA0">in the pre&s;ence of God, and in a hopele&s;s and helple&s;s condition. But without this di&s;covery realized, there can be no &s;alvation, for the &s;inner will not be di&s;po&s;ed to receive with humble gratitude the &s;alvation which the go&s;pel proclaims, unle&s;s &s;en&s;ible that he &s;hall peri&s;h without it. This &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul to the plan of grace in our &s;alvation, is therefore much in&s;i&s;ted on in the go&s;pel as requi&s;ite to acceptance with God, who "exalts and gives grace to the humble, but aba&s;es the proud."</P>
<P N="2">2. CONNECTED with this di&s;covery of our&s;elves, is a &s;incere repentance of &s;in before God and a &s;incere reformation of heart and life. That &s;tate of mind before mentioned prepares the way for this. Con|viction of impotency and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is nece&s;&s;a|ry to repentance. We mu&s;t fir&s;t be con&s;cious that we have offended,&mdash;and that we are unable to redeem our&s;elves from condemnation, before we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to confe&s;s and for&s;ake &s;in, and implore forgivene&s;s. And to create in us this right di&s;po&s;i|tion, the goodne&s;s of God to &s;inners, hath furni&s;hed us with a rich variety of means, happily calculated to accompli&s;h the end,&mdash;&s;uch as the holy &s;criptures, &s;aobaths, ordinances&mdash;providences&mdash;the admoni|tions of con&s;cience and the operations of the divine &s;pirit on our minds. This heavenly agent is divine|ly commi&s;&s;ioned, by his powerful influence on the mind, to convince of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s and the judgment to come; and to make the in&s;trumental means of light and grace effectual to the &s;inners repen|tance and conver&s;ion. This he does by &s;etting before the mind the terrors of the law, broken by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; convincing the &s;inner that he has offended, and fallen under the &s;entence of condem|nation, and this prepares the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="73" REF="028999_0069_0FDDD059375AC6C0">
3. To re&s;ort to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the divinely appoint|ed &s;aviour of &s;inners, and to commit him&s;elf to him, confiding in his fini&s;hed and all-&s;ufficient righteou&s;|ne&s;s for acceptance with God, and a title to eternal life. The acceptable wor&s;hipper believes in God; "for he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that he is;" and without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e him. Without &s;uch an operative faith in God, as compre|hends the knowledge of, and love to his character and laws, our external devotion is but a lifele&s;s form. Connected with a &s;aving, operative faith in God, as merciful to &s;inners, is faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we have acce&s;s to the father. He is the only mediator between God and man, and the &s;oul prepared for &s;alvation confides in him, repo&s;ing its immortal intere&s;ts in his hand, on whom the father hath laid, help, mighty to &s;ave. "Ye believe in God," &s;ays our Lord to his di&s;ciples, "believe al&s;o in me." We are ju&s;tified and &s;aved only on account of his perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, for who&s;e &s;ake a holy God heareth and accepteth &s;inners. And to entitle us to the pre&s;ent and everla&s;ting benefits of that righteou&s;ne&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary upon the plan of the go&s;pel, that we believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or gratefully and without re&s;erve, confide in him as the "Lord <HI>our</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s." For he has magnified the law which we have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and which we cannot &s;atisfy; and the benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of that right|eou&s;ne&s;s are offered to all, and conveyed to them who <HI>believe</HI> in him. And none but tho&s;e who believe are qualified to po&s;&s;e&s;s that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures teach us, that &s;aving faith in God, and in our divine &s;aviour is an effect of an important and &s;urpri&s;ing change; called "a new heart, a new &s;pirit, and a being born again." The&s;e figurate terms do not imply that any new faculty is given,
<PB N="74" REF="028999_0070_0FDDD05EA76D79B0">or phy&s;ical change made as to the e&s;&s;ential powers of the &s;oul, but that the change is in the di&s;po&s;ition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mind towards &s;piritual objects. The &s;ubject of this grace has a new ta&s;te for &s;piritual enjoyments. She is offen&s;ive and hateful, and holine&s;s lovely and de&s;irable. The mind thus rightly di&s;po&s;ed to the objects which religion pre&s;ents to its view, may be &s;aid to be born into a new world of &s;piritual life, objects and enjoyments. Old things are pa&s;&s;ed away and behold all things are new. The new exerci&s;es of heart, in con&s;equence of the&s;e right views of God, and of the Saviour, are expre&s;&s;ed in &s;he go&s;pel, by coming to Chri&s;t,&mdash;believing and tru&s;ting in him,&mdash;receiving Chri&s;t,&mdash;hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;putting off the old man with his deeds which are corrupt, and putting on the new man, which after God, or in conformity to him, is created in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. That faith in Chri&s;t which ju&s;tifies is a living and operative principle, producing purity of heart and the works of holy obedience. The&s;e ju&s;tify the believers faith and prove it evangelical, and confirm his hope in Chri&s;t. The de&s;ign of their redemption from the dominion of &s;in and from the condemna|tion of the law, is that they &s;hould &s;erve God in newne&s;s of &s;pirit, and be a peculiar people, to the prai&s;e of him, who hath called them out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light. "Ye were &s;ometimes dark|ne&s;s, but now are ye light in the Lord, walk as children of the light."</P>
<P>THIS preparation, firs, is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for us, upon the plan of the covenant of grace, would we hope to &s;erve and wor&s;hip a holy God, with accep|tance. Let us then with earne&s;t and per&s;evering importunity, humbly look up to the father of lights, from whom cometh down all good and perfect gifts;
<PB N="75" REF="028999_0071_0FDDD05FF698BEE0">that he would give us a new heart and grace, whereby we may wor&s;hip and &s;erve him acceptably with reverence and love and Godly fear, now and evermore.</P>

<P>HAVING in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the foundation of acceptable wor&s;hip, in the heart renewed after the image of God, by a holy principle, producing the good works of repen|tance, faith and univer&s;al obedience; we now pro|ceed to &s;hew in &s;undry particulars, the nature of that religious wor&s;hip of God, which is commanded, by the moral and evangelical law.</P>
<P N="1">1. PRAYER is a moral and religious duty; our
<PB N="78" REF="028999_0073_0FDDD06742DD1010">ab&s;olute dependence on God, for all that we po&s;|&s;e&s;s or enjoy, and for all that good and happine&s;s which we hope for, in time, and forever, teaches us to acknowledge God in all our ways, and in all his mercies and providences, towards our&s;elves and others. The light of nature teaches men to ac|knowledge, with gratitude to God, their depend|ence, for in him we live and move and have our being; and to pre&s;ent con&s;tantly the tribute of thank&s;giving and prai&s;e, for all mercies; and &s;ince e&s;pecially we have offended God by &s;in, that we humbly confe&s;s to God our &s;ins, and implore his merciful forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>WE are, by prayer and &s;upplication, with thank&s;|giving, to make known our reque&s;t to God. "I exhort," &s;ays St. Paul, "therefore, that fir&s;t of all &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men,&mdash;for this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour."</P>
<P N="2">2. READING, preaching and hearing the word of God, is a part of that religious wor&s;hip, which God hath appointed. "How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how &s;hall they hear without a preacher? "So faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." God hath appointed &s;tated, and regular attendence, on his word and ordinances, as the ordinary way of obtaining &s;piritual and &s;aving knowledge. He meets his &s;incere wor&s;hippers and ble&s;&s;es them in his hou&s;e of prayer. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, where full a&s;&s;emblies meet to pray and prai&s;e and hear," more than all the private dwellings of Jacob. The apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, went abroad a|mong the nations, preached the word of &s;alvation, and gathered churches to Chri&s;t, among idolatrous
<PB N="79" REF="028999_0074_0FDDD069C4283D50">gentiles. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of chri&s;tian churches, among the nations had been predicted by ancient prophets. "From the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, even unto the going down of the &s;ame, my name &s;hall be great among the gentiles, and in every place incen&s;e (of prayer and prai&s;e) &s;hall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name &s;hall be great among the heathen." God has appointed, that in the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies we hear his word with rever|ence, and receive it with love and obedience.&mdash; "Keep thy foot when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of God, and be more ready to hear, than to offer the &s;acrifice of fools, for they confider not that they do evil."</P>
<P N="3">3. PRAISING God in &s;acred p&s;almody is an ordi|nance of public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip; and without this animating part, public wor&s;hip is languid and lifele&s;s. With <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y elevation of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul, and &s;olemn and cheerful voices, we are to celebrate the good|ne&s;s and greatne&s;s of Jehovah. "Singing and making melody in our hearts unto the Lord." Our Lord and the di&s;ciples, at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;acramental &s;upper, &s;ang an hymn. Public wor&s;hip is with propriety introduced with p&s;almody. "En|ter his courts with &s;inging. Let the word of God dwell in you richly, in all wi&s;dom; teaching and admoni&s;hing one another, in p&s;alms and hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in your hearts to the Lord."</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;acred ordinances of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, con&s;titute a &s;olemn part of public wor&s;hip. Chri&s;t &s;ent out his apo&s;tles to baptize all nations, believing parents and children "in the name of the father, and of the &s;on, and of the holy gho&s;t:" and in&s;tituted the holy &s;upper, to be ob&s;er|ved
<PB N="80" REF="028999_0075_0FDDD06B41F57ED0">in the church, as a lively emblem of his atone|ment by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf for &s;in, and of the efficacy of his mediation, and hath promi&s;ed his pre|&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ings with his mini&s;ters and churches, in the admini&s;tration of the&s;e ordinances, to the end of the world. The&s;e ordinances are to be celebrated in the public a&s;&s;embly; that by the bapti&s;m of water, the congregation may be reminded of the &s;olemn obligations of their covenant with God, and the nece&s;&s;ity of purification from daily offences, by the clean&s;ing virtue of the blood of &s;prinkling, which clean&s;es from all &s;in. And that by the &s;acrament of bread and wine, their hearts may be duly affected with the boundle&s;s love of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he &s;hewed to us, in laying down his life for us, when he made his life an offering for &s;in, and bore the cur&s;e of the law, even the death of the cro&s;s, that we might obtain life and glory in heaven. This ordinance &s;hews al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ity of our receiving Chri&s;t by faith and feeding on him, as the life and nouri&s;hment of our &s;ouls. "The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Chri&s;t? And the cup which we partake is it not the commu|nion of the blood of Chri&s;t?" Every friend of Je&s;us, is bound to partake of this memorial of our merciful Lord and Saviour. A principle of grati|tude &s;hould bring us to his table, who has provided a fea&s;t for our &s;ouls; and his effectionate command, "This do in remembrance of me," leaves us with|out excu&s;e, if we ab&s;ent our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THESE two are the principal ceremonial or po&s;i|tive rites of the go&s;pel church, happily delivered from the burcen&s;ome bloody and co&s;tly rites of the an|cient church. "The yoke of Chri&s;t is ea&s;y, and his burden is light."</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="81" REF="028999_0076_0FDDD0714FD86198">
5. THE ble&s;&s;ing at the conclu&s;ion of public wor|&s;hip, is al&s;o a part of the &s;ame. The Mo&s;t High, appointed Aaron and his &s;ons, to ble&s;s the congre|gation. And this the apo&s;tles al&s;o did in the chri&s;|tian churches. And they u&s;ually conclude their epi&s;tles to the churches, with a &s;acred benediction. The&s;e are a &s;ummary of the &s;everal parts of public &s;ocial wor&s;hip, which God hath appointed to be ob&s;erved in his church, and who&s;e in&s;titutions we are to ob&s;erve always, for the glory of God, and the furtherence of our own &s;alvation, by the means ap|pointed and ble&s;&s;ed, for the conveyance of &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, to the &s;incere enquirer, from the God of all grace and con&s;olation, who hath promi&s;ed to "make his people joyful, in his hou&s;e of prayer."</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is the will of God, that we wor&s;hip him by prayer, in &s;ecret and in family devotion. In the duty of &s;ecret prayer, our Lord hath directed us,&mdash; "When thou praye&s;t, enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou ha&s;t &s;hut the door, pray to thy father, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, and who will reward thee openly." The duty and advantages of con&s;tancy in prayer, or our being ever in an habitual praying temper, he has taught us in the parable of the importunate widow, and the unju&s;t judge; "&s;aying, men ought always to pray, and not to faint." In every condi|tion and occurrence of life, the habit of the &s;oul &s;hould be towards God, &s;ending up its de&s;ires in pious ejaculations to him, who hears the &s;ofte&s;t whi&s;pers of the &s;oul, and &s;atisfies the de&s;ires of the mind, that piou&s;ly re&s;ts on him.</P>
<P>THE wor&s;hip of God in families is a divine ordi|nance. We have family mercies to implore&mdash;fam|ily &s;ins to confe&s;s, and family ble&s;&s;ings, that demand the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e. And with family devotion,
<PB N="82" REF="028999_0077_0FDDD072C8B7FEA0">family in&s;truction, coun&s;el and correction, are divinely in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>MOST honorable was the encomium which, the Mo&s;t High was plea&s;ed to give to the pious patri|arch Abraham,&mdash;"I know him, that he will com|mand his children, and his hou&s;ehold after him, that they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, and do ju&s;tice and judgement."</P>
<P>THE morning and the evening &s;acrifice was ap|pointed under the law, and the morality or fitne&s;s of the appointment remains, in full force under the go&s;pel. In the &s;criptures, prayerle&s;s families are cla&s;&s;ed with the heathen, and fall under the &s;ame condemnation with idolatrous pagans. "Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who know thee not, and upon the families, that call not upon thy name." Tho' God pours temporal ble&s;&s;ings into the lap of families, who neither know, nor acknowledge him; they are but providential gifts, they come not in covenant mercy, and if ungratefully received, will eventually prove cur&s;es, in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ings. For the goodne&s;s of God to men is intended to lead them to repentance.</P>
<P>THE wor&s;hip which we are to render to God has its foundation in the heart. It is the wor&s;hip of the &s;pirit. This is a wor&s;hip and &s;ervice &s;uitable to the nature of the great object of our devotion, and for us, as &s;piritual and rational beings, to pay. God is a &s;pirit, from whom our &s;piritual nature is derived, and we mu&s;t wor&s;hip him with our &s;pirits, in truth and &s;incerity. To wor&s;hip God acceptably compre|hends a knowledge of God, a belief in his word, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority, a devotion of all the powers of body and mind to him, and an earne&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="028999_0078_0FDDD0789593D1A8">di&s;po&s;ition to glorify him in our bodies, and our &s;pirits which are his. It implies a &s;upreme love to God&mdash;fidelity in his &s;ervice, and purity of inten|tion; con&s;cious of his pre&s;ence, our obligations, and accountablene&s;s to him.</P>
<P>GOD regards the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart in all our profe&s;&s;ions and &s;ervices, more than our external obedience. That his people may pre&s;ent to him this inward &s;piritual homage, he hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, that he will give them, "a new heart and put his &s;pirit within them; and cau&s;e them to walk in his &s;tatutes, and write his law upon their hearts." The prayer of the heart only is accepted. It is the a&s;pirations of a pious &s;oul. The &s;acrifice, which God accepts, is a &s;incere, contrite &s;pirit. "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." The prayer of Hannah at the temple, met with gracious acceptance, tho' it was only the breath|ings of her &s;ervent mind, for her voice was not heard. The Phari&s;ee at the &s;ame place, had not the &s;pirit of prayer. His prayer aro&s;e not, from a &s;en&s;e of &s;piritual want. But the prayer of the Pub|lican was accepted, becau&s;e it was the &s;incere de&s;ire of a &s;oul, humbled before God, by a &s;en&s;e of un|worthine&s;s, believing in the mercy and ju&s;tice of God. We mu&s;t therefore draw nigh to God with the heart, would we hope for audience and accep|tance. Praying always with all prayer and &s;up|plication, in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance." The&s;e remarks re&s;pecting the temper and &s;tate of the mind, in the exerci&s;es of religion apply to every duty and &s;ervice, which we offer to God. Our prayers, our preaching, and hearing, and attendance on ordinances, mu&s;t be done &s;piritually, would we hope for acceptance, with a holy God, the &s;earcher of hearts. The accepta|ble
<PB N="84" REF="028999_0079_0FDDD07994D5A610">wor&s;hipper, can with humble confidence, with St. Paul, appeal to him, &s;aying, "God is my witne&s;s, whom I &s;erve with my &s;pirit, in the go&s;pel of his &s;on." "He," &s;ays our Lord, "who hear|eth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them," who receives them into his heart and practi&s;es them in his life, "is like a wi&s;e man who built his hou&s;e upon a rock." Our &s;ongs of prai&s;e mu&s;t be &s;pirit|ual as well as vocal. "Singing and making melod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in your heart unto the Lord." The &s;acraments we are to attend upon, and receive with devotion of &s;oul. As bapti&s;m is an outward &s;ign of inward pu|rity, it requires the wor&s;hip of the &s;pirit, the graces of faith, &s;incerity and purity, in him who dedicates him&s;elf, or his offspring to God, in that ordinance. And in our attendance on the Lord's &s;upper, we are to examine our&s;elves, whether our hearts are right with God, and to know our &s;piritual &s;tate, that we may di&s;cern the Lord's body, and &s;piritual|ly feed on him, the bread of life and the water of life.</P>
<P>THUS all parts of public wor&s;hip are to be per|formed with our &s;pirits, as unto the Lord. By what has been &s;aid, on the &s;pirituality of devotion, let none imagine that a per&s;onal attendance and &s;er|vice, are not required. For we are to &s;erve God with our bodies, as well as our &s;pirits. This is evident from the nature of the &s;everal branches of in&s;tituted wor&s;hip, as well as the expre&s;s declara|tion of &s;cripture. From the preaching of the word, &mdash;public prayer and prai&s;e, and the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, and the in&s;titution of the &s;abbath for the public wor&s;hip of God, our per&s;onal atten|dence and homage, are made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028999_0080_0FDDD07B05383650">
OUR wor&s;hip of God, mu&s;t be performed accord|ing to his word, or agreeably to his appointment. As all parts of the &s;acred tabernacle, were to be made after the pattern which was &s;hewn to Mo&s;es on the Mount, &s;o all parts of our religious wor&s;hip, both as to the di&s;po&s;ition of heart, and external ob|&s;ervance, mu&s;t be according to tho&s;e rules and direc|tions, which God hath given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in his word. Any deviation from them is &s;inful and idolatrous. So far as we depart from the perfect rule given for our direction, our wor&s;hip degenerates into human in|vention and idolatry. Per&s;ons are in danger of this &s;in, who di&s;regard the divine directions, in faith, in manners, and modes of wor&s;hip, and follow the dictates of their own fancy and impul&s;es. Having no certain guide, they wander in endle&s;s mazes of error. And altho' &s;uch evil-wor&s;hippers may be &s;incere in their devotions, their &s;incerity will not &s;anctify their errors, or excu&s;e their di&s;obedience to the divine will. And the rea&s;on is, that the truth may be found, if men are di&s;po&s;ed with &s;incere and unprejudiced minds to enquire after it. "If any man," &s;ays our Lord, "will do his will," in truth and &s;incerity, &s;o far as he already knows the will of God, "he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether it be of men." A mind open to conviction, and impartially enquiring after truth, will not be in danger of embracing any e&s;cen|tial errors.</P>
<P>PERSONS are &s;ometimes &s;incere and zealous in great errors; and their &s;incerity and zeal will not excu&s;e them from blame and puni&s;hment. The wor&s;hippers of fal&s;e gods were zealous and &s;incere in their idolatrous practices. How fervent were the wor&s;hippers of Baal in calling upon their imaginary gods? and the people of Ephe&s;us, in the wor&s;hip of
<PB N="86" REF="028999_0081_0FDDD0811D45BA88">their great godde&s;s Diana? But could their &s;ince|rity extenuate the crime of wor&s;hipping and &s;erving a creature, in&s;tead of the Creator? The I&s;raelites were &s;incere, in the wor&s;hip of the golden calf in the wilderne&s;s; but heavy judgments fell upon them for their idolatry. The wor&s;hippers of im|ages, crucifixes, &s;aints and angels, in the church of Rome, are &s;incere and devout, in the adoration of them; but God hath rejected them for this im|pious idolatry. "They &s;ay they are jews, and are not, but are of the &s;ynagogue of Satan." Paul be|fore his conver&s;ion was &s;incere, in his zealous oppo&s;i|tion to Chri&s;t, and per&s;ecution of his di&s;ciples; but when his prejudices were removed and his mind opened to embrace the truth, he condemned him&s;elf as having done mo&s;t wickedly, as a "bla&s;phemer and injurious."</P>
<P>THO' pagan idolaters were &s;incere in their wor&s;hip of fal&s;e gods, yet the divine &s;pirit hath a&s;&s;ured us, that "the things which the gentiles &s;acrifice, they &s;acrifice to devils and not to God." Hence we infer the greatne&s;s of that moral di&s;order, which &s;in hath brought upon mankind, which &s;o awfully dark|ens the rea&s;on, perverts the judgement, and cor|rupts the pa&s;&s;ions, that without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we know not our duty, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a reve|lation to enlighten our darkened minds, and of effectual grace, to overcome the oppo&s;ition of our hearts to the pure knowledge of God, and that &s;piritual wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, which is &s;uitable to his holy perfections and will. We come,</P>
<P N="3">III. To an explanation of the penalty of this divine law, "vi&s;iting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028999_0082_0FDDD08297B077E8">
SOME would be ready to conclude that this &s;anc|tion of the law is an impeachment of ju&s;tice, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the declaration of God by the pro|phet, (Ezekiel xviii, 20.) "The &s;on &s;hall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither &s;hall the father bear the iniquity of the &s;on, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous &s;hall be upon him, and the wick|edne&s;s of the wicked &s;hall be upon him." Tho' there is a &s;eeming oppo&s;ition here, a few con&s;idera|tions may &s;erve to reconcile them.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE evils threatened to the children of idola|ters, are not &s;piritual but temporal calamities or judgements. God would di&s;play this token of anger again&s;t idolatry, in the view of the world, to teach men how great a &s;in it is. But tho' temporal judgements were to fall upon the children of idola|ters, we are,</P>
<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider, they are the merciful means, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, of reforming the children of &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. For judgements are commi&s;&s;i|oned to reform, and turn men to righteou&s;ne&s;s, or,</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD calls to account the children of idolaters, for their own &s;ins; which ju&s;tice in God, is in part cau&s;ed by the &s;ins of their fathers; &s;o that the chil|dren are not puni&s;hed for their fathers' &s;ins, but their own; which however, would not have been &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed with temporal judgements, had not their fathers tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHILDREN being part of the parents in their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, it is proper that they &s;hould feel the effects of their iniquities. As when a rebel again&s;t his country forfeits his life, his children nece&s;&s;arily partake in the puni&s;hment, by the lo&s;s of honor
<PB N="88" REF="028999_0083_0FDDD08480EAC978">and e&s;tate. It is al&s;o agreeable to the law of nature, that the children &s;hould partake of the effects, of the virtues or vices of their parents. Thus the children of temperate and virtuous parents, are commonly healthy, honorable and u&s;eful, in the world, and the children of debauched, intemperate and vicious parents, feel the melancholy effects of their parents' crimes. And thus good or evil de|&s;cends, by a law of our nature, without any im|peachment of the ju&s;tice of providence.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE threatning implies, that the children them|&s;elves practice the evil ways of their fathers, and thus fill up the mea&s;ure of their own, and their fathers' &s;ins, and ripen them&s;elves for judgement. Thus our Lord pronounces the judgements of heaven upon that generation, who walked in the evil ways of their fathers, who had killed the prophets; and &s;ays that of them, &s;hould be required the innocent blood which had been &s;hed, for ages pa&s;t, becau&s;e they inherited the murderous tempers of their fathers. Thus awful denunciations of judgements, are threatened to re&s;train men from &s;in, that fore|&s;eeing the evil con&s;equences to follow, not only on them&s;elves but on their unborn po&s;terity, they may have powerful motives of all kinds to fear God, and keep his commandments. I will add, that there is an exemption from the threatning to tho&s;e children of vicious parents, who &s;nun their fathers' crimes, and ob&s;erve God's law. (Ezeki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> xviii, 14.) "If he begat a &s;on that &s;eeth all his fathers' &s;ins, which he hath done, and con&s;idereth them, and doth not &s;uch like,&mdash;he &s;hall not die for the iniquity of his father, he &s;hall &s;urely live."</P>
<P>THE la&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is, the motives to envite us, to the true and acceptable wor&s;hip of
<PB N="89" REF="028999_0084_0FDDD08970AB07B8">God, contained in the promi&s;e, "&s;hewing mercy to thou&s;ands of them that love me, and keep my commandments." Here we may notice the great extent of the mercy of God, beyond his ju&s;tice. "Vi&s;iting iniquity to the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>fourth</HI> genera|tion,&mdash;but &s;hewing mercy to thou&s;ands, to the late&s;t generations of them that love God and keep his commandments."</P>
<P>THIS gracious promi&s;e gives an inviting motive to parents, to maintain the knowledge and wor&s;hip of their God and &s;aviour in their own hearts, and families, and places where they dwell. God will reward their pious zeal, with ble&s;&s;ings temporal and eternal. From pious families, his providence u&s;ually takes tho&s;e who are honored with di&s;tingui&s;h|ed u&s;efulne&s;s in the world. While the po&s;terity of accur&s;ed Cain peri&s;hed in the flood, and the de|&s;cendents of an undutiful Ham, and of a profane E&s;au, felt the effects of their fathers impieties, the de&s;cendents of pious Abraham, of venerable Jacob, and holy Job, were di&s;tingui&s;hed with the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven. The &s;ame conduct, a ju&s;t and merciful God, appears to manife&s;t towards the people and families of the earth, at the pre&s;ent day. The po&s;|terity of the wicked and idolatrous nations and fam|ilies, &s;till &s;uffer his frowns; and the po&s;terity of the people and families, who maintained his pure wor|&s;hip and laws, in ages pa&s;t, are &s;till ble&s;&s;ed. With gratitude to a promi&s;e-performing-God, &s;uffer me to mention, the apparent fulfilment of this gracious promi&s;e to us, the de&s;cendents of the pious &s;ettlers, of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tates, who loved God, and kept his holy commandments. Has not God &s;hewed mercy, &s;irs, to us, unparalled in the hi&s;tory of the world, even as he &s;hewed mercy to the de&s;cendents of I&s;rael? Like them, our fathers received the law
<PB N="90" REF="028999_0085_0FDDD08AC4322C48">in this wilderne&s;s, (when they were few in number and &s;trangers in the land) not from Mount Sinai, but from Mount Zion, and the uncorrupted word of God. Here they erected the true church accor|ding to the pattern of the go&s;pel, and &s;incerity kept the ordinances and commandments of their God. Let us with unfeigned gratitude, acknowledge the kindne&s;s of God to them, and to us their degener|ate po&s;terity, &s;ince God hath &s;hewed us &s;uch &s;ignal mercies in things temporal and &s;piritual. At the &s;ame time a holy fear becomes us, le&s;t by our in|gratitude and crimes&mdash;our &s;piritual idolatry&mdash;our neglect, and contempt of the word, wor&s;hip, ordi|nances and commandments of God, our Saviour, we forfeit the favorable protection of our God, and the God of our fathers, and ripen our&s;elves for an aggravated condemnation.</P>
<P>THUS having con&s;idered the nature of that wor|&s;hip and homage which God requires of us, and which our duty, our intere&s;t and felicity, invite us to render to him, I &s;hall conclude with a few</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reflections">
<HEAD>REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE learn the great evil and guilt of all kinds of idolatry. Let us guard again&s;t every &s;pecies of this &s;in, which is the greate&s;t of evils, and wor&s;hip and love and &s;erve God in truth and &s;incerity. Let us not, by idolizing our&s;elves, or the deare&s;t earth|ly enjoyments, provoke the dreadful vengeance of a jealous God. He is plea&s;ed to receive his people into the bonds of a marriage covenant, and de|mands that we cleave to him in love, loyalty and obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="028999_0086_0FDDD08C3A9B0188">
THEY provoke God to jealou&s;y and wrath, who di&s;regard his fir&s;t and great command, and love him not with all the heart; but place their be&s;t love and delight, on the peri&s;hable goods and en|joyments of this life, and idolize the creatures. Let us, &s;irs, guard again&s;t this &s;piritual idolatry, nor &s;uffer our &s;ouls to re&s;t in the peri&s;hable goods of this world. In this enlightened age, we may not be in great danger of the <HI>gro&s;s</HI> idolatry of wor&s;hip|ping images; yet are not multitudes really guilty of &s;piritual idolatry, in the &s;ight of God? Let us &s;hun the &s;in of that <HI>covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or love of riches, which is <HI>idolatry.</HI> "For the love of money, for its own &s;ake, is the root of all evil." If that is an idol upon which our love and dependence are placed, then all they are idolaters, who tru&s;t in uncertain riches, and de&s;erve no better trea&s;ure than gold and &s;ilver; "who &s;ay to the gold thou art my hope, and to the fine gold, thou art my confidence." A per&s;on is as guilty of idolatry, in the &s;ight of God, who puts his tru&s;t in bags of gold and &s;ilver, as he would be, &s;hould he ca&s;t them into an image, and wor&s;hip it.</P>
<P>THEY who&s;e chief happine&s;s is in the gratification of animal and &s;en&s;ual appetites and lu&s;ts, "who&s;e God is their belly, who mind earthly things," are criminal idolaters. All they who&s;e &s;upreme happi|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in hou&s;es, and lands, goods and flock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and herds; in children, companions and friends; or in the pur&s;uit and enjoyment of the honors and grandeurs, the amu&s;ements and plea&s;ures of life; fall under the condemnation of this law; and with|out repentance and reformation, mu&s;t &s;uffer the wrath of an offended God.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET our &s;ubject admoni&s;h us, of the nece&s;&s;ity of a daily and &s;erious examination of the principle of
<PB N="92" REF="028999_0087_0FDDD0915BC0A128">our profe&s;&s;ions and obedience. Is the love of God the great and powerful principle of action? Do we love him for his whole revealed character, as a God of holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, as well as goodne&s;s; &s;triving to be conformed to him in the&s;e perfections, to be holy and merciful as our almighty father in heaven? Does our love to God produce its genuine good fruits of loyalty and obedience, a willing, cheerful, per&s;evering and univer&s;al obedience? God has promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to them who <HI>love him</HI> and <HI>keep his commandments.</HI> And to keep his command|ments and do them, is the proof of our love. If we have not this evidence, we have not the love of God reigning in us; but fall under the condemna|tion of idolatrous lovers of this world, of &s;in, and lovers of our&s;elves, more than lovers of God.</P>
<P>BUT happy is the man who&s;e heart condemns him not, in this enquiry. Who knows he loves God with all his heart, and who&s;e hope and tru&s;t and joy the Lord is. Who with the di&s;ciple of Je&s;us, can appeal to the &s;earcher of all hearts, in truth and &s;incerity, &s;aying, "Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee." And with the royal p&s;almi&s;t, "whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is nothing upon earth, that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee? As the heart panteth after the water-brook, &s;o panteth my &s;oul, after thee, O God."</P>
<P N="3">3. WE infer that it is the duty of all men to wor|&s;hip God. It is a dictate of the law of nature, and a precept of revelation. Even wicked men, by at|tendance on the public &s;hor&s;hip of God, may obtain the grace of conver&s;ion. The go&s;pel was fir&s;t preached to unregenerate men, and to tho&s;e of this di&s;cription it is &s;till to be preached, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is their duty to attend and hear, as for their lives. "For

Faith to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." The heathen of Ninevah will ri&s;e up in the judgment, and condemn tho&s;e who, having the means of knowledge and &s;alvation, u&s;e them not.</P>
<P N="4">4. OUR &s;ubject &s;hould &s;erve to excite our thank|fulne&s;s to God, that he hath not &s;uffered us to grope and peri&s;h in the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m; but hath cau&s;ed the light of the go&s;pel to &s;hine upon us. "Let us look to the rock, whence we were hewn, and to the hole of the pit, whence we were digged." Let us open our eyes with gratitude and joy, to the "day-&s;pring from on high which hath vi&s;ited us, who once &s;at in darkne&s;s, and the &s;hadow of death, without God and without hope in the world." O may we bring forth the fruits of prai&s;e and love, to the honor and glory of him who hath redeemed us.</P>
<P>LASTLY, let us cultivate an habitual &s;en&s;e of a pre|&s;ent God; who&s;e pre&s;ence, providence and protec|tion and goodne&s;s continually &s;urround us. And e&s;pecially, in all our &s;olemn approaches to God in ordinances, let no athei&s;tical thoughts intrude upon our devotion. In all our attendance upon the &s;acred in&s;titutions of God's wor&s;hip, in our clo&s;et, in our families, and in the hou&s;e of God, may the life and power of religion, reign in all our hearts, and regu|late our lives. And through the rich grace of our divine Saviour may we obtain that mercy, which is promi&s;ed to them, who love God and keep his commandments.</P>

<P>Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s, that tak|eth his name in vain.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS &s;olemn precept is connected with the two preceding, and teaches us, that we &s;hould ever habituate our&s;elves to think and &s;peak of God, with the profounde&s;t reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: and that we &s;hould feel the &s;ame &s;acred awe on our minds, in receiving the notices of his will, revealed to us by his word, his works, his ordinances and providences, and by his holy &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As the &s;econd precept teaches us the way and manner, in which it is the will of God that we &s;hould wor&s;hip him, <HI>this</HI> &s;hews us, that our wor&s;hip mu&s;t be paid with that profound reverence and love, which are due from creatures to their creator, in all their tran&s;actions with him; and that we al&s;o have a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of obligations to God, and accounta|blene&s;s to him in all our intercour&s;e with mankind. The &s;anction annexed to this precept, re&s;training men from an irreverent u&s;e of the name of God, &s;hould impre&s;s all minds with holy caution and fear,

<P N="1">1. INQUIRE what it is to profane the name of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. SHEW the evil and guilt of this &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE oppo&s;ite virtues.</P>
<P>IN the illu&s;tration of the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of this di&s;|cour&s;e, it will be proper to explain, what is meant by the <HI>name</HI> of God, and what it is to profane his name.</P>
<P>THE <HI>name</HI> of God, is frequently u&s;ed in the &s;criptures for God him&s;elf, and is expre&s;&s;ive of his ab&s;olute exi&s;tence, or his being and perfections. "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; that is, the glory which is due to him as God. O magnify the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. Then began men to call on the name of the Lord. The Lord proclaimed the name of the Lord. I am the Lord, that is my name. I will &s;anctify my name, and make my holy name known in the mid&s;t of my people." Perhaps the general phra&s;e <HI>name,</HI> may be u&s;ed for God, becau&s;e no particular word, can convey an adequate idea, of his glorious and incomprehen&s;ible nature.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to convey to us, the know|ledge of what he is plea&s;ed to reveal of him&s;elf, &s;o far as may be nece&s;&s;ary to regulate our conceptions
<PB N="97" REF="028999_0091_0FDDD09C0BB64E68">of his mo&s;t holy nature and will, and of our duty. At the &s;econd writing of the law, the Mo&s;t High &s;aid, "I will proclaim the name of the Lord,&mdash; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious;&mdash;and the Lord proclaimed his name, the Lord God mer|ciful and gracious, long &s;uffering and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, and forgiving iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, and that will by no means clear the guilty." When God commi&s;&s;ioned Mo&s;es to deliver I&s;rael from the hou&s;e of bondage, he called him&s;elf by the comprehen&s;ive names, <HI>I am,</HI> and <HI>I am, that I am;</HI> which titles are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of his ab&s;olute being and perfec|tions. It is u&s;ed for the infinite greatne&s;s and ma|je&s;ty of God: "In Judah God is known, his name is great in I&s;rael." For his glorious perfections di&s;|played in the works of creation and providence: "O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!" For the purpo&s;es of his grace and mercy towards mankind by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: "I have, &s;ays our Lord, manife&s;ted thy name, to the men, which thou gave&s;t me out of the world." For the go&s;pel; of Saint Paul, it is &s;aid; "he is a cho|&s;en ve&s;&s;el to bear my name among the Gentiles." For the promi&s;es of grace, to believers: "let them that love thy name be joyful in thee." For the wor&s;hip of God, and the divine ordinances: "I purpo&s;e, &s;ays Solomon, to build an hou&s;e unto the name of the Lord my God." And to his father David, God had &s;aid; "thy &s;on, whom I &s;hall &s;et upon thy throne, he &s;hall build an hou&s;e to my name:" or for my wor&s;hip, in prayer and prai&s;e, and in reading and hearing my word.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>name</HI> of the Lord, is u&s;ed for the Lord him&s;elf, and &s;ignifies all that God is, and all tho&s;e things which he is plea&s;ed to reveal to us, concern|ing
<PB N="98" REF="028999_0092_0FDDD09D89BFF8C0">his holy nature, character, ways, laws, and will; and is a phra&s;e mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and compre|hen&s;ive.</P>
<P>To profane, or take in vain the name of God, is to think or &s;peak of God irreverently, or to treat his holy names or titles, his works, his word, his ordinances and providences, with levity. As man|kind are in danger of this &s;in, by rea&s;on of the temptations of a depraved nature, of a profane world, and the great enemy of God and our &s;alva|tion; in danger of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing this holy command|ment, either in our thoughts, our &s;peech or beha|viour; and thereby provoking and meriting the wrath and vengeance of a holy God; we will con|&s;ider in what in&s;tances and circum&s;tances particular|ly, the name of God is profaned. It is profaned,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN God is mentioned with levity, irrev|erence or needle&s;sly in common di&s;cour&s;e. "Holy and reverend is his name." God is to be had in reverence by his creatures, and we &s;hould ever think and &s;peak of him, with utmo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and the profounde&s;t re&s;pect. It is a melancholy evidence of the depravity of human nature, and of the alieanation of the heart from God, that among certain cla&s;&s;es of people, the name of God, is bla&s;|phemiou&s;ly profaned, in their common and idle di&s;cour&s;e. Multitudes impiou&s;ly pre&s;ume to ap|peal to God, and &s;wear by him who liveth forever, to the truth of their incon&s;iderate and pa&s;&s;ionate conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>A reverence of the name of God is not u&s;ually lo&s;t at once: but the vice of profanene&s;s is gradual|ly contracted, until it becomes a confirmed habit. An idea of the maje&s;ty, holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of God,
<PB N="99" REF="028999_0093_0FDDD09EF7423998">received by the works and word of God, and im|pre&s;&s;ed upon the con&s;cience, naturally in&s;pires the mind, with a &s;olemn awe, at the name of God. It is this impre&s;&s;ion of God on the mind, which guards and re&s;trains men from the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which their vicious hearts, would prompt them to commit, could they era&s;e from their thoughts, his awful and glorious being and attributes, and a future &s;tate of retribution. But per&s;ons by indulging them&s;elves to &s;peak of God, and &s;acred in&s;titutions, in a light and airy manner, finally contract a habit, of bold and un|blu&s;hing profanene&s;s. Again&s;t this God-provoking crime, this precept of the law, &s;olemnly cautions men. "Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain." The name of God is profaned when it is needle&s;sly mentioned, as well as when uttered in light and trif&s;ing di&s;cour&s;e, and on common occa&s;ions. It ought never to be mentioned, except when the occa&s;ion is weighty and &s;olemn, and for our own, and the edification of others. To u&s;e the name of God to confirm or atte&s;t our trifling di&s;cour&s;e, is an act of mo&s;t daring familiarity and impudence: but to u&s;e it to atte&s;t a fal&s;ehood, is the mo&s;t criminal profanene&s;s and im|piety; and unle&s;s the mercies of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hrough the ble&s;&s;ed mediator, to penitent profane &s;inners, were infinite, &s;uch bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors could not expect forgivene&s;s, neither in this world, nor in the world to come. How daring and provoking is it, for an in&s;ignificant mortal, and child of the du&s;t, to invoke the God of truth, to witne&s;s to a lie? Again&s;t the temptations to this awful &s;in, the pious prophet Agur prays: "Give me neither poverty, nor rich|es;&mdash;le&s;t I be poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of my God in vain."</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="028999_0094_0FDDD1A0B3B40DB0">
THAT which makes the vice of pro&s;ane &s;wearing, more criminal than other &s;ins, is the remarkable circum&s;tance, that it is commonly committed with|out a temptation. Other vices have each their pe|culiar temptations, to per&s;uade and impel men to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of God, and of &s;ociety. But what advantage does the pro&s;ane per&s;on propo&s;e to him&s;elf, by this crime? There is neither the pro&s;|pect of honor, profit or plea&s;ure, tho&s;e great &s;prings of action, to induce the &s;in. The vice of avarice, has the pro&s;pect of gain and wealth, for its object. Intemperance and lewdne&s;s; the grati|fication of &s;en&s;ual appetite, and fle&s;hly lu&s;ts. Fraud and di&s;hone&s;ty; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the property of others. Slander and fal&s;ehood; the malicious plea|&s;ure of revenge. But what temptation can there be, to profane the name of God, or treat with levi|ty, the character and attributes, of that high and holy being? It is, as one ob&s;erves, to catch at the devil's naked hook: there is not the bait of a temp|tation to invite. It is a vice indicative of the deep depravity of the human heart, and of hatred of God. O dete&s;table and ruinous fruit of &s;in!</P>
<P>IT is an affront to &s;erious men; who are wound|ed and grieved, to hear the name of their God, whom they fear and love, treated with profanity. It is a violation of the laws of decency and good breed|ing; and a vice beneath the character of a gentle|man, and is mo&s;tly to be found among the lower cla&s;&s;es. It would be happy for the peace and com|fort of &s;ociety, and the benefit of the ri&s;ing genera|tion, were this &s;hocking vice univer&s;ally bani&s;hed from conver&s;ation. That per&s;on mu&s;t be very in|different to virtue, who has not re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. It is evident that the profane per&s;on has little regard for God, when the pre&s;ence of any of his fel|low
<PB N="101" REF="028999_0095_0FDD5FE503C3F958">men, whom he regards, or fears to di&s;oblige, will re&s;train him, altho' the knowledge of God's pre&s;ence, will not. But every profane per&s;on is a practical athei&s;t: he does not believe in the being or pre&s;ence of God, nor the threatnings of his word.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD's name is profaned by unlawful oaths, vows and promi&s;es; and al&s;o by the violation of lawful &s;olemn promi&s;es and vows. A lawful oath is a religious act, in which is contained the acknowledg|ment of the exi&s;tence and pre&s;ence of God, as a wit|ne&s;s and judge, and an appeal to him for the truth of what is &s;poken; and an implicit imprecation of his ju&s;tice upon him who &s;hall knowingly utter fal&s;ehood. Before lawful courts, it is u&s;ually accompanied with lifting up the hand towards heaven, in a way of &s;olemn appeal to God. It is the mo&s;t &s;peedy and &s;ure method, which human wi&s;dom can devi&s;e, to come to the knowledge of facts, in which the wel|fare of &s;ociety is concerned. It proceeds upon the principle, that no per&s;on will knowingly utter fal&s;e|hood; but con&s;cienciou&s;ly declare the truth, when he thus &s;olemnly appeals to God. In &s;o &s;erious a tran&s;action, it becomes a per&s;on, to cultivate the deepe&s;t reverence of God, and &s;acred regard to truth, le&s;t by inattention or mi&s;repre&s;entation, he pervert ju&s;tice, and draw down upon him&s;elf, the anger of that dread being, who will not hold him guiltle&s;s, who &s;ins by fal&s;ehood and perjury. Let a &s;olemn caution guard tho&s;e, who are about to appeal to God, by oath, in any matter.</P>
<P>IT is a profanation of the name of God, to &s;wear or promi&s;e ra&s;hly, and without due con&s;ideration: as did Herod when, probably heated with wine, he promi&s;ed with an oath, to give to Herodias, what|ever &s;he &s;hould a&s;k. It is a great &s;in to make a ra&s;h
<PB N="102" REF="028999_0096_0FDDD0A39E3ACCD0">or unlawful vow, but a greater &s;in to keep it. He|rod's oath was fooli&s;h and criminal; but his crime was greater when to accompli&s;h it, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red an innocent and holy man. "And the king was &s;orry; neverthele&s;s for the oath's &s;ake, and them that &s;at at meat with him, he &s;ent and beheaded John in pri&s;on." The oath or promi&s;e was unlaw|ful, and therefore not binding. The obligations of duty to God and man, &s;hould re&s;train men from unlawful vows, or excite them to repentance of them, when made; and to refrain from the performance. The vow of Jephtha al&s;o was ra&s;h and unlawful: He promi&s;ed more than he had a lawful right to do.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e men of the ea&s;t, who came to wor&s;hip the new-born Saviour, did right in their non com|pliance with the promi&s;e, which the bloody minded Hered, had extorted from them; when in&s;tead of returning to Jeru&s;alem, they went into their own country, another way. We have an in&s;tance of unlawful promi&s;es, in the men who bound them|&s;elves by an oath, that they would neither eat, nor drink, until they had killed Paul. All promi&s;es or oaths in things unlawful and injurious to others, are not binding: but are di&s;annuled by a prior and &s;uperior law, which obliges us to promi&s;e and do, only &s;uch things as are lawful, and agreeable to the moral law, or to the expre&s;s will of God. It is the duty of a per&s;on who has made a ra&s;h or &s;inful pro|mi&s;e or vow, &s;incerely to repent thereof before God, and to make re&s;titution to men, &s;o far as he may have thereby injured any.</P>
<P>THE inference from the&s;e remarks is, that unlaw|ful promi&s;es and vows, are not to be made, or kept. But when per&s;ons &s;olemnly vow or promi&s;e, things lawful at the time, and afterwards it appears, that
<PB N="103" REF="028999_0097_0FDDD0A6D4D7A5C8">the performance will be detrimental to the promi&s;er, &s;till his &s;olemn promi&s;e is binding. Thus the right|eous man is de&s;cribed; "tho' he &s;weareth to his own hurt, he changeth not." We may al&s;o infer that unlawful promi&s;es extorted by violence or du|re&s;s, are not obligatory.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion connected with this la&s;t ob&s;ervation, meets this &s;ubject; but which may not be &s;o ea&s;y to re&s;olve, which is; Whether a per&s;on in captivity, may lawfully promi&s;e allegiance, to an enemy, in time of war? The &s;olution of this que&s;tion, depends upon the nature and extent of the promi&s;e, or oath required. If it requires, that he &s;hall behave him|&s;elf as a peaceful and dutiful &s;ubject of the govern|ment, and the civil laws of &s;ociety; he may lawfully promi&s;e &s;o to do; becau&s;e there is no human power &s;uperior to controul him, and becau&s;e his per&s;on is in their hands. To this conduct, the mo&s;t High directs the people of I&s;rael in captivity in Babylon. "Seek the peace of the city, whether I have cau&s;ed you to be carried away captives: and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof ye &s;hall have peace." But if it is required of him to a&s;&s;i&s;t per|&s;onally, in the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of the property or lives, of his countrymen and friends; that he may not law|fully do: becau&s;e his obligations to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> them, are prior and &s;uperior, to his obligations to an ene|my. Neither is it lawful for a per&s;on to utter a known fal&s;ehood, nor to abjure the true religion, for the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects of favor or ad|vantage, or even the &s;aving of life it&s;elf: For the moral law of God to men, has infinitely &s;uperior ob|ligations to any human authority. In &s;uch ca&s;es, men mu&s;t obey God, rather than man: and &s;olemn|ly attend to that declaration of our Lord to his de|&s;ciples, to fear that high and holy being, who is able to de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="028999_0098_0FDDD0A8008C3A70">
LAWFUL promi&s;es and vows are &s;uch as are agree|able to the revealed will of God; and are &s;acredly binding: unlawful promi&s;es and vows, are &s;uch as are contrary thereto, and are not binding.</P>
<P>AN objection, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, is found again&s;t oaths in general, in the declaration of our Saviour, the &s;upreme lawgiver of the chri&s;tian church, in his expo&s;ition of this precept, Mathew fifth. "Again ye have heard, that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf, but &s;halt per|form unto the Lord thine oaths. But I &s;ay unto you &s;wear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth for it is his foot|&s;tool; neither by Jeru&s;alem, for it is the city of the great King.</P>
<P>NEITHER &s;halt thou &s;wear by thy head, becau&s;e thou can&s;t not make one hair white or black.</P>
<P>BUT let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for what&s;oever is more than the&s;e, cometh of evil."</P>
<P>Two things are ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e words: fir&s;t, that profane &s;wearing, was a fa&s;hionable vice among the Jews; and &s;econdly, the &s;wearing here condem|ned, was not &s;olemn oaths, before a lawful judge or court. That the vice of profane &s;wearing, is what our Lord here condemns, appears from the nature and objects of the oaths, it was &s;wearing by heaven, by Jeru&s;alem, by the earth, by the head, and pro|bably by the members of the body, as by the eyes and the like, as is common among the profane lower cla&s;&s;es of people, at this day. And altho' the name of God, was not mentioned in tho&s;e common and vulgar oaths; yet our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that this
<PB N="105" REF="028999_0099_0FDDD0A976826C08">&s;acred precept of the law, is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by them; &s;ince there is implied in them, an appeal to God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, of the bo|dy, and all its limbs and members. By his crea|tures God makes him&s;elf known, and his pre&s;ence is in, and with them. To &s;wear by them, is to &s;wear by the Creator; according to that rule, "when men &s;wear, they &s;wear by the greater."</P>
<P>OUR Lord does not condemn lawful oaths; but condemns the corrupt doctrine of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who taught that it was not unlawful to &s;wear by creatures, provided the name of God was not mentioned. All petty oaths, &s;o called, as when per&s;ons in common di&s;cour&s;e exclaim, Lord, Chri&s;t, by faith, con&s;cience, or &s;alvation; tho' &s;eemingly mode&s;t oaths, yet are condemned, as profaning God's name; &s;ince all creatures and properties of creatures, are his. Again&s;t this &s;inful and indecent cu&s;tom, the command of Chri&s;t is given, "&s;wear not at all." That the oaths condemned, were &s;uch as were mixed in common conver&s;ation, appears from their being mentioned as mingled with their daily communication. "Let your communication be yea, and nay." The affirmation of yes, and no, is &s;ufficient in common conver&s;ation. A &s;acred re|gard to truth and duty makes any &s;tronger declara|tions, or appeals to God, or creatures, unnece&s;&s;ary and &s;inful. The per&s;on who interlards his di&s;cour&s;e, with profane exclamations and oaths, to gain belief, evidences that he has not a regard to truth, in com|mon affirmations; and that he has a &s;u&s;picion in his own brea&s;t, that he ought not to be believed; and by &s;wearing impeaches his own veracity. And indeed you can have no confidence in his regard to truth, &s;ince by profane &s;wearing, he &s;hews that he
<PB N="106" REF="028999_0100_0FDDD0AEEAD32A50">has no regard to the God of truth, and the avenger of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>THIS vice, condemned by our Lord, is al&s;o condemned by the apo&s;tle James: "But above all things, my brethren, &s;wear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay." The&s;e words are nearly a repetition of the &s;entence delivered by our Lord, already mentioned. The apo&s;tle adds, "le&s;t ye &s;all into condemnation." The condemnation alluded to, is the awful penalty of this precept: "the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s."</P>
<P>FROM an erroneous interpretation of the&s;e texts, &s;ome &s;ects of chri&s;tians, have altogether refu&s;ed to take an oath, in civil courts. That oaths are law|ful and &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, appears not incon&s;i&s;|tant with the precepts of the moral law; but are agreeable to the will of God, revealed in both the old and new te&s;tament.</P>
<P>BY the judicial law, which God gave to I&s;rael at Sinai, it was allowed, to a per&s;on, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;u&s;pected of a crime, to clear him&s;elf by a &s;olemn oath. God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onde&s;cended to give a promi&s;e to the patriarch Abraham, and to confirm it by an oath; that by the&s;e two immutable witne&s;&s;es, the promi&s;e and oath, he, and all belivers might have &s;trong con&s;olation, in the certain expectation of the fulfil|ment of the divine promi&s;es. We here &s;ee that the nature and de&s;ign of an oath, is to confirm the truth &s;poken; and as it concerns the Deity, the certainty of the fulfilment of the things promi&s;ed. It was the will of God, that the church of I&s;rael, &s;hould ratify their covenant with him by an oath. "And thou
<PB N="107" REF="028999_0101_0FDDD0B0556059E0">&s;halt &s;wear the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>RESPECTING the chri&s;tian's duty, in this &s;olemn act, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, Hebrews &s;ixth, "For men verily &s;wear by the greater; and an oath for con|firmation, is to them an end of all &s;trife." Such being the nature and &s;alutary effects of a &s;olemn oath,&mdash;to di&s;cover truth,&mdash;to clear the innocent&mdash; to convict the guilty, and to put a &s;top to the pro|gre&s;s of unhappy contentions; the chri&s;tian, who rightly knows his duty, will not refu&s;e it, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n de|manded by lawful authority. But it is to be la|mented, that the frequent repetition of oaths, tends to le&s;&s;en their &s;olemnity, and defeat the good end of their in&s;titution; and that it is but too common to admini&s;ter, and take them, without due con&s;ider|ation.</P>
<P>GOD's name is wickedly profaned, when per&s;ons wi&s;h evil and de&s;truction upon them&s;elves, or others. Profane &s;wearers wi&s;h awful judgments and damna|tion upon them&s;elves; as tho' they accu&s;ed God of inju&s;tice, in delaying to execute vengeance upon them; as tho' their damnation lingered. Dread|ful implety! Per&s;ons are liable to the judgment of this law, who wi&s;h evil in their hearts, to any. "Thou &s;halt not hate thy brother in thy heart. Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf." Were the golden rule of the go&s;pel, of wi&s;hing and doing to others, "as ye would that others &s;hould to you," in univer&s;al practice; all wrath and profanene&s;s would be bani&s;hed, and the ble&s;&s;ings of chri&s;tian love and peace abound.</P>

<P N="1">1. PROFANE &s;inners are expo&s;ed to the wrath and judgments of almighty God, both in this life, and in the life to come. They ca&s;t off the fear and love of God, are rebels again&s;t his holy laws, forfeit the

<P>AGAINST &s;uch proud and impious &s;inners, we mu&s;t rea&s;onably expect, that the dreadful cur&s;es of the law, are pointed, and that "God will not hold them guiltle&s;s."

<P>HUMAN laws cannot reach all the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this law: profanene&s;s, perjury and bla&s;phomy, fre|quently e&s;cape adequate puni&s;hment in this world.

<P N="2">2. PROFANENESS is a vice, ruinous to the morals of a people. It is almo&s;t univer&s;ally attended with other immoralities. The profane &s;wearer, is re|gardle&s;s of promi&s;es and of the truth; he is fal&s;e, proud, heady and contentious.

He &s;peaks evil of dignities, and &s;ets his mouth again&s;t heaven: for having ca&s;t off the fear of God, he regards no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man. And what bond can re&s;train him, who boldly defies the laws of God and of &s;ociety? What principle has he at heart, impeling him to the cultivation of the mo|ral virtues?

As we &s;ee in the in&s;tance of a profane Cain, on whom God &s;et a mark, as the victim of his ju&s;tice, and doomed him to wnader a vagabond on the earth, &s;hunned and dete&s;ted by men.

In a pro|fane E&s;au, a hardened Pharaoh, a proud Nebu|chadnezer, and a bloody Herod; and in the in|&s;tance of the ungodly and profane people of the Jewi&s;h nation, among whom the vice of profanene&s;s reigned; who di&s;pi&s;ed the prophets of the Lord and divine ordinances, and filled up the mea&s;ure of their crimes by the crucifixion of Je&s;us, and impiou&s;ly imprecated the divine vengeance to fall upon them. And upon them, the ju&s;t wrath of God has fallen, from the days of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles. For this cau&s;e, the once favoured and fertile land of Judea, now mourns under the cur&s;e of barrenne&s;s and barbarians; and the people of that nation, have become a "hi&s;&s;ing and bye word in the earth," and outca&s;ts among the nations. They are a living evidence to all the earth, of the wrath and judg|ments of Almighty God, due to all profane per|&s;ons and people.</P>
<P>FOR the crimes condemned by this divine pre|cept, they were once doomed to long captivity in Babylon, and now to a wandering life of anxiety and wretchedne&s;s, over the earth. "Seeing ye de&s;pi&s;ed the oath, by breaking the covenant, ye &s;hall not e&s;cape. Thus &s;aith the Lord, as I live, &s;urely my oath, that he hath de&s;pi&s;ed, and my covenant that he hath broken, will I recompence upon his own head, and I will bring him to Baby|lon and plead with him there, for his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es that he hath tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t me." This life is a &s;tate of trial and retribution to nations. They are pun|i&s;hed or pro&s;pered accordingly as they ob&s;erve the immutable laws of morality and the doctrines of revelation. And the rea&s;on of this economy is,
<PB N="115" REF="028999_0108_0FDDD0C819274520">that nations, as &s;uch, have no future exi&s;tence. The &s;ocial ties, which combine nations, are di&s;&s;olved, by death.

<P>BUT the wi&s;dom of God in his moral govern|ment of the world, has connected a certain degree of reward to virtue in this life, and of puni&s;hment to vice; and thus gives to men, by the light of rea&s;on, a &s;ure argument, that invariable ju&s;tice governs the world, and that men will receive in the future world, a recompence, according to their cha|racters. Thus the vice of fal&s;ehood is followed with the lo&s;s of credit,&mdash;fraud and di&s;hone&s;ty, by infamy, &mdash;intemperence and &s;en&s;uality, by the entailment of di&s;ea&s;es and untimely death,&mdash;and profanene&s;s by the lo&s;s of influence and reputation, and the con|tempt
<PB N="116" REF="028999_0109_0FDDD0CA98462450">of good men. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ens of heaven's di&s;|approbation of vice, are expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ive monitions, of greater puni&s;hments, which a wait hold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, when they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their &s;tate of trial for eternity.</P>
<P>BUT a plea&s;ing reward, the anticipation of future happine&s;s, attends a life of virtue and piety. The righteous man is honored and loved, by the wi&s;e and good: the profane per&s;on is feared and contem|ned. The righteous man has peace of mind, con|fiding in God, tho' his outward condition may be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: the profane per&s;on has perplexity and trouble of con&s;cience, tho' his worldly circum&s;tances may be pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>PROFANE per&s;ons, tho' apparently bold, are in reality great cowards: they are profane in a calm, but devout in a &s;torm,&mdash;they are impious in pro&s;pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity, and mean in adver&s;ity,&mdash;they bla&s;pheme God, but are afraid of men. Their happine&s;s is in ap|pearance, and not real. Unle&s;s hardened beyond reproof, they feel at times the dreadful accu&s;ations of an awakened con&s;cience; and "de&s;truction from God is a terror to them" They are believ|ers in the pro&s;pect of death, but infidels in health. An impious Bel&s;hazzar profanes the &s;acred ve&s;&s;els of the &s;anctuary, in mid-night revelling; but his limbs trembled and &s;mote together, at the di&s;covery of the divine hand, writing his doom. The ways and works of the profane will not eventually pro&s;|per. The mo&s;t high hath &s;aid, "The cur&s;e &s;hall enter into the hou&s;e of the thief, and into the hou&s;e of him, that &s;weareth fal&s;ely by my name." If profane &s;inners e&s;cape temporal judgments, they have rea&s;on to fear the infliction of judgments more dreadful, even &s;piritual judgments, of hardne&s;s of
<PB N="117" REF="028999_0110_0FDDD0CBF81A1B38">heart, and the divine dereliction, placing them even in this life, beyond the calls of mercy and &s;alvation, and dooming them to remedile&s;s de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>THE imprecations of profane &s;inners, and their works are &s;ometimes retaliated upon them. "As they have done, &s;o God hath required them." Or, in the prophetic &s;tile of the p&s;almi&s;t, "As he loved cur&s;ing, &s;o let it come unto him; as he clothed him&s;elf with cur&s;ing, like as a garment, &s;o let it come unto his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones, let it be unto him, as the garment that covereth him."</P>
<P>WITH lively emotions of compa&s;&s;ion and &s;orrow, let us leave the profane tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, to his own con&s;cience and to God, and enquire,</P>
<P>LASTLY, what are tho&s;e virtues and duties, which are oppo&s;ite to the &s;ins prohibited. The oppo&s;ite of the profanation of God's name, is to reverence or &s;anctify it. "Sanctify the Lord of ho&s;ts, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread." Our Lord hath taught us, the du|ties commanded in this precept, in the fir&s;t petition, of the divinely comprehen&s;ive form of prayer, <HI>"hal|lowed be thy name."</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT implies the duty of meditating on God, with reverend and devout exerci&s;es of heart, and looking to him with humble and adoring importu|nity, for all that light and grace which are nece&s;&s;ary, to our forming ju&s;t and true conceptions, of his adorable character, perfections and will. God is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious being in the uni|ver&s;e, and we &s;anctify his name, when we make him the chief object of our thoughts, our &s;tudy, and
<PB N="118" REF="028999_0111_0FDDD0CD7645E3F0">our love. We &s;hould meditate on God, as that glorious being, by who&s;e power and goodne&s;s we, and all creatures enjoy, each moment of exi&s;tence, and on who&s;e favor we are to depend, for its conti|nuance, and for all that good which &s;hall be needful, to make our future exi&s;tence, de&s;irable and happy. It implies that we &s;peak of God, with devout &s;enti|ments, of fear and love. That whenever we ex|pre&s;s his name, his perfections, works and word, that it be always in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, or on &s;olemn occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="2">2. It implies that we readily and cheerfully obey the notices of his will. The will of God, re|lative to our duty, is communicated to us, by rich and plentiful means. The exi&s;tence, the maje&s;ty, the wi&s;dom and beneficence of God, are di&s;played in the works of creation and providence; and many of the virtues of morality and righteou&s;ne&s;s towards men, and of piety and devotion towards God, are di&s;|coverable from the&s;e &s;ources, and from the divine impre&s;&s;ions on the natural con&s;cience; but the &s;acred &s;criptures give us more true and exalted conceptions of God, and ju&s;ter notions of our condition, depen|dence and obligations, than all other means of in|formation, which heaven hath given to mankind.</P>
<P>ALTHO' the works of creation proclaim the ma|je&s;ty and the goodne&s;s of God: yet the &s;un, moon and &s;tars, do not preach the go&s;pel, or teach guilty &s;inners, the way of their acceptance with a holy God; how he will be wor&s;hipped, or how they may be &s;aved from condemnation, and po&s;&s;e&s;s eternal life and fe|licity. For the&s;e luminous and joyful di&s;coveries, for want of which, the wi&s;e&s;t heathen wandered in darkne&s;s, perplexed with errors; for the&s;e di&s;cover|ies we are indebted to divine revelation, emphatical|ly
<PB N="119" REF="028999_0112_0FDDD0D318534F68">called "the word of God, which can make us wi&s;e to &s;alvation." There we have line upon line, and precept upon precept, to guide us in the paths of peace and holine&s;s, unto eternal life. We are to receive the bible as a mo&s;t precious me&s;&s;age from God, containing the whole duty of man; to read, hear and meditate upon its ble&s;&s;ed contents, with that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, love and devotion which it demands from us; and make it the profitable and plea&s;ing &s;ubject of our daily meditation. We &s;anctify God in and by his word, when with praverful hearts, di|ve&s;ted of prejudice, we enquire at tho&s;e holy oracles, what is truth? and conform our faith and practice wholly to its &s;acred precepts. For the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul; and the go&s;|pel of Je&s;us, can make the &s;imple wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE are devoutly to wait on God in all the ways of his appointment, to obtain the &s;aving bene|fits of his grace. The ordinances of the &s;abbath, the mini&s;tration of the go&s;pel, the &s;acraments and prayer, are to be ob&s;erved by us, with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;olemnity, gratitude and prai&s;e; imploring the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon them, to our comfort and &s;alvation: for they are in&s;trumental means, divine|ly ordained, for this end. If our hearts are opened to in&s;truction, they will be &s;anctified to us, to in|crea&s;e our knowledge of God and of duty, to e&s;tab|li&s;h and confirm our faith in the divine promi&s;es, and invigorate our hope, and love and zeal; to purify our hearts from &s;in, and a&s;&s;imulate us to a holy re&s;emblance of him, who hath called us out of the darkne&s;s and guilt of our fallen &s;tate, into the marvellous light of his &s;piritual and everla&s;ting king|dom.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are to &s;anctify God, by meditation upon the glorious works of creation and providence, and
<PB N="120" REF="028999_0113_0FDDD0D511CC3E70">adoring him for all the wonderful di&s;plays of his greatne&s;s, his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s therein. "His works are marvellous, &s;ought out by all them, that have plea&s;ure in them." In the contemplation of the &s;tarry heavens, and tho&s;e works of the almighty which come within the compa&s;s of our knowledge, the &s;erious mind will be filled, with admiration, and the heart warmed with love and reverence of the creator, from whom the ho&s;ts of heaven came, and who&s;e adorable perfections are manife&s;ted in them. We are to reverence God in his providences; by gratitude and prai&s;e for mercies, for protections and deliverences: to acknowledge his hand in all events which happen to us, humbly &s;ubmitting to afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations, as wi&s;e and ju&s;t and good, and committing our&s;elves at all times to his holy keeping.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE &s;anctify the name of God, by &s;incere re|pentence of &s;in, and confe&s;&s;ion to God, and a willing and cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of our &s;ouls to the method of our &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The gift of Chri&s;t to redeem us, is the riche&s;t gift of heaven to men. "This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners." Thanks be to God for this un&s;peakable gift. The Saviour comes to redeem us from &s;in, and all our wo, and to rai&s;e the believ|ing and obedient, to di&s;tingui&s;hed honors and feli|city, in the heavenly world. A proper &s;en&s;e of the mercy of God herein, will excite the pious mind to reverence and adore the divine goodne&s;s, which remembered us in our low e&s;tate, and &s;ent his &s;on to &s;ave us. We are to reverence God, by an en|lightened zeal to maintain his pure wor&s;hip and or|dinances, in oppo&s;ition to errors, from every quar|ter; and "to &s;tand fa&s;t in the light and liberty of

<DIV2 TYPE="reflections">
<HEAD>WE will clo&s;e this &s;ubject, with a few REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is matter of grief to good men to hear or &s;ee the name of God profaned, either in that more re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, to which common &s;peech confines the profanation of the name of God or that more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, to which the latitude of the precept extends. As a &s;ubject honors his &s;overeign, and a child his father; and are offended when their name and character are abu&s;ed, &s;o the faithful &s;ervant of God, is wounded at the profane &s;peeches, and ungodly lives of &s;inners. "I beheld, &s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and was grieved, be|cau&s;e they keep not thy law." Their grief ari&s;es from two cau&s;es, one is their regard for God, and zeal for his glory; and the other, the dreadful guilt which profane &s;inners heap upon them&s;elves, where|by they are preparing for ha&s;tening dreadful puni&s;h|ment. A &s;acred zeal for the honor of God, who&s;e ordinances were profaned by unlawful traffic, exci|ted our Lord, to drive from the inclo&s;ures of the holy temple, tho&s;e mercenary &s;inners, who had pol|luted it. A degree of the like pure zeal for God, and the ordinances of the go&s;pel, in&s;pires every pious mind. They e&s;teem the &s;abbath a delight, and its ordinances holy and honorable; &s;triving to maintain the beauty of holine&s;s, in the &s;ervices of God, and their Saviour. They are edified and plea&s;ed to &s;ee others walking in the ordinances and commandments of the Lord, and honoring their
<PB N="122" REF="028999_0115_0FDDD0D80CED5380">chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, by lives of &s;obriety, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and godline&s;s. They are grieved to &s;ee the hou&s;e and ordinances of God neglected, and his name prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d, by the unhallowed lips and lives of men. This regard to divine ordinances is, &s;irs, a te&s;t of your love and loyalty to God. If you are the friends of God, you will honor his in&s;titutions, and by your good example, will &s;trive to have all men glorify your father in heaven. Oppre&s;&s;ed with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;eige in Jeru&s;alem, a pious Hezekiah, was more grieved at the bla&s;phemous &s;peeches of the enemy, again&s;t God, than any other calamity. The honor of God was dear to him. It is a &s;ure evidence of a child of God, to be troubled at the di&s;honor which &s;in does to God, e&s;pecially the &s;in of profaning his name, his wor&s;hip, his word, his or|dinances, and the bounties of his providence.&mdash; Have you this filial temper? Is the honour of God, your heavenly father, near your heart? When you behold the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, the profane, the intemper|ate, the irreligious and immoral, are you grieved, becau&s;e they tran&s;gre&s;s the good and holy laws of your God? Do you &s;incerely pity them, and by all prudent ways, endeavour to reclaim them to virtue, and to God? Remember for your encou|ragement, that he that converteth a &s;oul, from the error of his ways, &s;hall &s;ave from death, and hide a multitude of &s;ins.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS &s;ubject &s;ounds a dreadful alarm to pro|fane finners. "God will not hold them guiltle&s;s." The wrath of God, is now revealed from heaven, in terrible accents, in the cur&s;es of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w, again&s;t the profane abu&s;ers of his name and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce; but more dreadful will be the terrors of its execution on them. O that they were wi&s;e, to con&s;ider the awful ju&s;tice of that glorious being, who&s;e name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="123" REF="028999_0116_0FDDD0DD6830B240">&s;port, who&s;e authority they now de&s;pi&s;e, and who&s;e incen&s;ed vengeance they mu&s;t endure! That by timely repentance and reformation, they may e&s;cape the wrath to come, upon the finally impenitent.</P>
<P>CURSING and &s;wearing is emphatically called the language of hell. That di&s;mal region re&s;ounds with bla&s;phemies again&s;t God, and mutual horrid accu&s;a|tions and cur&s;es. Let none of you, &s;irs, cheri&s;h this infernal fire. The profane &s;inner carries a hell in miniature in his own brea&s;t; and oaths and cur|&s;es are as the &s;moke of the bottomle&s;s pit, i&s;&s;uing out of his mouth. As he loved cur&s;ing, it will come upon him, and the cur&s;es of this fiery law, will fall upon him, thro' hopele&s;s ages. The profane per&s;on like E&s;au, will be rejected of God. Too late will he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e his rolly: but will find no place for repentence&punc; tho' like him, he &s;hould &s;eek it care|fully, with tears. By the dreadful increa&s;e of this &s;in, the land mourneth. Multitudes of the ri&s;ing generation li&s;p the language of profanity. They take it by imitation from their &s;uperiors in age. How melancholy the thought, that in any in&s;tances, children catch this vice from their parents. That tho&s;e who are in the place of God, to their chil|dren, to teach them to reverence the name and wor|&s;hip of God, yet do by their example, teach them to profane his name. O ye profane parents, will it alleviate your future torments, that you have brought your children, and others to that world of mi&s;ery? The guilt and puni&s;hment of your own &s;ins, and the &s;ins of others, will lie dreadfully upon you, an in&s;upportable weight, &s;inking you down in the gulf of eternal errors. A holy God, provoked by this heaven-daring impiety, has threatened, that he will cau&s;e his fury to come, to take vengeance. Will profane &s;inners provoke the Lord to wrath? Are
<PB N="124" REF="028999_0117_0FDDD0DEB9B3CA20">they &s;tronger than he? An alarming con&s;ideration, attends this vice, which is, that it hardens the heart, and fortifies it again&s;t conviction of the truth, and thus prevents the &s;inners &s;alvation, and &s;eals his dreadful doom.</P>
<P>FINALLY, my brethren, let us habituate our minds to a &s;olemn reverence of God. Let him be in all our thoughts, for on him we continually de|pend, and to him, we mu&s;t give account of all our thoughts, our &s;peech and behaviour; and from his unerring tribunal, we mu&s;t receive a &s;entence for eternity, according to our characters.</P>
<P>MAY the &s;olemn and momentous &s;cenes of eter|nity, on which we &s;hall &s;peedily enter, powerfully re&s;train from all irreverent and profane &s;peech and behaviour, towards our almighty Creator and Judge, whom all creatures are bound to fear, to love and &s;erve, with all their powers, thro' all periods of their exi&s;tence; who is able to &s;ave the &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> who &s;anctify his name, and to de&s;troy profane &s;inners, both body and &s;oul in hell.</P>
<P>WHEN the ungodly and profane, &s;hall be con|founded with con&s;cious guilt, and overwhelmed with wrath divine, tho&s;e who fear God, and keep his commandments, will be joyful in his &s;alvation, and prai&s;e and honor and wor&s;hip him forever.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THE &s;abbath was in&s;tituted by Jehovah, im|mediately upon the fini&s;hing the glorious works of creation. In the &s;econd chapter of Gene&s;is, its original in&s;titution is recorded. "God ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day and &s;anctified it; becau&s;e that in it, he had re&s;ted from all his works, which God created and made."</P>
<P>ADAM and Eve were created on the &s;ixth day, and God appointed the &s;ucceeding &s;eventh day, as a day of holy re&s;t, and religious &s;olemnity and joy. God ble&s;&s;ed and &s;anctitied the &s;abbath. It was made for man's edification and comfort in God. It was fir&s;t kept by our innocent primeval parents in Pari|di&s;e: The holy angels a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and uniting with them, in the celebration of the prai&s;es of the glori|ous Creator. And what a &s;olemn joyful day to them, who but the day before, came from nothing
<PB N="127" REF="028999_0120_0FDDD0E9486B0780">into exi&s;tence, perfect in &s;tature, and in under&s;tand|ing, with hearts that beat re&s;pon&s;ive, in wonder, gratitude and love to God, for all his glory and goodne&s;s, di&s;played around them, and upon them! The &s;un has never ro&s;e upon &s;uch a happy pair. In all the charms of innocence, and blooming youth and beauty, on that &s;acred morning, they beheld for the fir&s;t time, with raptures of holy joy, light dawning in the ea&s;t, and the &s;un ari&s;ing mild and glorious; and their new formed tongues broke forth in exclamations and &s;ongs of prai&s;e to their Creator. All things were new to them, and excited their profounde&s;t, devout admiration and love. They &s;aw and adored the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, in their own creation, and in all his &s;tupen|dous works on the earth and heavens. The mate|rial creation, &s;eemed to them to confe&s;s God, as its author, in &s;ilent, but expre&s;&s;ive language. And the living creatures, birds and bea&s;ts, plea&s;ed with their new exi&s;tence, prai&s;ed God in various harmo|nious notes and &s;ounds. And Adam was as the prie&s;t of creation, to prai&s;e God, for them. The holy angels united with our fir&s;t parents, in the celebration of the high prai&s;es of God, for all his wonderful works of power and goodne&s;s, on that holy day. Then tho&s;e morning &s;tars, the &s;ons of God, &s;ang together, and &s;houted for joy.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t high having &s;anctified the day, as a &s;ea|&s;on of religious &s;olemnity and &s;acred joy, probably on the fir&s;t &s;abbath, conde&s;cended to give to the parents of mankind, &s;ome &s;pecial tokens of his pre|&s;ence in Paradi&s;e, and directions for the ob&s;ervance of the day, for their edification and comfort, and his own glory. Never was a &s;abbath &s;o devoutly and joyfully ob&s;erved: For man was then but lit|tle lower than the angels in intelligence and dignity,

But we have rea&s;on, alas, to conclude that it was the la&s;t, as well as fir&s;t &s;abbath, which has ever been kept in perfect purity, innocency and happine&s;s. O ye highly favored, yet unhappy pa|rents of the human race, how &s;oon, thro' the frailty of your nature, and the &s;ubtle enmity of the foe of God and man, too &s;oon, did ye loo&s;e the crown of innocency, and fall as Lucifer, &s;on of the morning. But if the earthly paradi&s;e was lo&s;t by the fir&s;t Adam, yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, a cele&s;tial paradi&s;e is found, by the &s;econd Adam, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the fallen &s;ons of men are now invited to enter its bli&s;s|ful and immortal bowers.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the tran&s;actions of the fir&s;t ages of the world, are &s;ummarily compri&s;ed in a few pages, by Mo&s;es, the in&s;pired hi&s;torian, &amp; thro' the long pe|riod of two thou&s;and five hundred years, from the cre|ation, to the deliverence from Egypt, there is no ex|pre&s;s mention of the &s;abbath. But we have rea&s;on to conclude that it was ob&s;erved agreeably to the original in&s;titution, by pious patriarchs and the church, with|out much interruption, to that time. Adam, no doubt, taught his children to keep it. There is an intimation that Cain and Abel wor&s;hipped God by &s;acrifice, on that day. It is mentioned that in <HI>pre|ce&s;s of time,</HI> they brought an offering unto the Lord: or as it may be tran&s;lated, <HI>at the end of the days,</HI> that is on the &s;abbath. The ancient &s;aints and patriarchs publicly wor&s;hipped God, and as to the manner and &s;ea&s;on, no doubt, agreeably to the divine direction. And that time was the &s;abbath, which God took care early to ordain, as a ble&s;&s;ed mean of pre&s;erving the knowledge of the true God, and original reve|lations.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="028999_0122_0FDDD0F183B39608">
IT is evident that the &s;abbath was known and ob|&s;erved before the delivery of the law at Sinai. Mon|tion is made of it &s;oon after I&s;rael's leaving Egypt, as a thing known to them. "To-morrow is the re&s;t of the holy &s;abbath unto the Lord,&mdash;&s;o the people re&s;ted on the &s;eventh day." This was pro|bably the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nth day in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from their com|ing out of Egypt, and that day might happen on the &s;abbath, or el&s;e the &s;abbath was re-in&s;tituted, in com|memoration of that great deliverance. Altho' in the text the rea&s;on given for the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath, is God's re&s;ting from his works, the &s;eventh day, yet in Deuteronomy, in which the decalogue is repeated, another rea&s;on is given, which was the won|derful deliverance which God wrought for the people of I&s;rael, in their redemption from Egypt. "Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the &s;abbath day to &s;anctify it,&mdash;and remember that thou wa&s;t a &s;ervant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God, brought thee out thence, thro' a mighty hand, and by a &s;tretched out arm; <HI>therefore</HI> the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the &s;abbath day." The &s;abbath was originally, in&s;titu|ted to commemorate the work of creation; but here to commemorate the redemption of the church of God, from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la|very of Egypt; figurative of our redemption from &s;in: and po&s;&s;ibly the day was changed from the &s;eventh, to the day of that deliverance. "The Lord ble&s;&s;ed the &s;abbath day and &s;anctified it." It is not &s;aid that the &s;eventh, but the <HI>&s;abbath day</HI> was ble&s;&s;ed and &s;anctified. And which day of the week this &s;hall be, depends upon the po&s;itive will of him who is Lord of the &s;abbath. The moral obligation of the law remains unalterable, but the particular day is a po&s;itive in&s;titution, and therefore might be changed, and &s;ome other day in&s;tituted, in comme|moration
<PB N="130" REF="028999_0123_0FDDD0F84D92F5D8">of &s;ome great deliverance, as that of the church of I&s;rael from Egypt.</P>
<P>THIS was &s;o wonderful an event as it re&s;pected the church and the world, that God commanded them to alter the beginning of their civil year in conformi|ty to it. And with equal propriety might the day of the &s;abbath be altered; and that without di&s;annulling the commemoration of the works of creation. It is called <HI>&s;abbath,</HI> which &s;ignifies a holy re&s;t, not only a ce&s;&s;ation from &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s, but a cea&s;ing from the &s;ervitude of &s;in; and &s;pending the day in the active &s;ervice of God, and the duties of religion. It is a day which God has in a &s;pecial manner ble&s;|&s;ed and &s;anctified, for religious purpo&s;es. It is to be &s;anctified by us, or kept holy, becau&s;e it is a fig|ure of the heavenly re&s;t; and is given as a pledge of the holy and everla&s;ting &s;abbath of re&s;t, in the heavenly world. There were other days of religious fe&s;tival appointed to be ob&s;erved by the Jewi&s;h church, which are &s;ometimes called &s;abbaths, as the pa&s;&s;over, in commemoration of their deliverance from Egypt, and typical of our redemption, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the lamb of God, by who&s;e blood we are &s;aved from wrath to come:&mdash;the fea&s;t of taber|nacles, in remembrance of the miraculous pre&s;er|vation of the church in the wilderne&s;s; and the annual days of atonement for &s;in. There was al&s;o the &s;abba|tical year: for every &s;eventh year the land lay un|tilled. There was neither &s;owing, nor harve&s;ting that year. God gave therein, con&s;tant proof of his &s;pecial &s;uperintending providence over his church, and taught them their dependence. The great in|crea&s;e of the ground, during the &s;ix preceeding years, afforded an abundant &s;upply for the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>THE religious ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath, or a
<PB N="131" REF="028999_0124_0FDDD0F9C9A1A320">&s;eventh part of time, is both a moral and po&s;itive law. That it is a moral law, or a law nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things, appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. IN its being given with the other precepts of the law, all of which are of a moral kind. It was given by Jehovah with utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, and in|&s;cribed on &s;tone as a perpetual law. The ceremo|nial laws were repealed on their accompli&s;hment by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They had re&s;pect to him and to the go&s;pel church, and therefore vani&s;hed when they had accompli&s;hed the end of their in&s;titution. But the weekly &s;abbath remains in force, becau&s;e it is ty|pical of the heavenly re&s;t. It was not therefore aboli&s;hed by the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, as the ceremo|nial laws were. As the&s;e laws and ob&s;ervances were &s;hadows of good things to come, and were not &s;et a&s;ide until tho&s;e good things did come: &s;o the week|ly &s;abbath, being a &s;hadow of the heavenly re&s;t, will not be &s;et a&s;ide, until the end of the world, when the everla&s;ting &s;abbati&s;m of the church of the re|deemed, will commence.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the in&s;titution of the &s;abbath is a moral law appears, from the obligations of creatures to wor&s;hip God. And in order to this a certain time or &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t be &s;et apart. As mankind are mutu|ally dependent and united in &s;ociety, and as &s;ocie|ties receive ble&s;&s;ings from God, it is proper that they &s;hould wor&s;hip God together in a &s;ocial &s;tate. As the light of nature, or a principle of gratitude, obliges us, as individuals, to acknowledge our de|pendance and obligations to God, for per&s;onal mer|cies, the &s;ame principles oblige us &s;o to do, in pub|lic or &s;ocial wor&s;hip. Heathen people offer to God, public &s;acrafices of than&s;giving and atonement. Natural gratitude invites to the one, and con&s;cious guilt impels them to the other. The &s;abbath is an in&s;titution calculated and intended, to increa&s;e our
<PB N="132" REF="028999_0125_0FDDD0FB4470D740">knowledge of God and duty, and the promotion of our mutual edification comfort and &s;alvation. And God is more vi&s;ibly glorified by wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;em|blies, than private devotion. As God is glorified, and our knowledge and &s;alvation promoted by the ordinance of public wor&s;hip, on the &s;abbath, we hence infer its obligation, becau&s;e the&s;e are the two principle ends of our exi&s;tence. The law of the &s;abbath is a po&s;itive law, &s;o far as it pre&s;cribes the proportion of time, to be con&s;ecrated to the duties of religion. God was plea&s;ed to ordain a &s;eventh part of our time. We may admire the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God in this. Had it been the eighth or tenth, or twentieth day, we &s;hould have been more liable to lo&s;e a &s;en&s;e of God, and the practi|cal influence of religion; and had it been oftner than one day in &s;even, it would have interfered with the nece&s;&s;ary duties, of our temporal life.</P>
<P>THUS the &s;abbath is a moral law, as it requires the public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip of almighty God, and is nece&s;&s;ary to our knowledge of God and duty, and our &s;piritual and eternal happine&s;s. All that is po&s;itive in its in&s;titution, is the de&s;ignation of the day, or the proportion of time con&s;ecrated to its ob&s;ervance. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the divine autho|rity &s;hould de&s;ignate the time, for were it left to the option of mankind, a diver&s;ity of days would be ob|&s;erved, by different &s;ocieties and people, and the good effects of its in&s;titution lo&s;t in a great degree, and perhaps totally. Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of duty to God, and of the wi&s;dom of the in&s;titution, chri&s;|tian legi&s;latures, have univer&s;ally, by human laws e&s;tabli&s;hed the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath. They have found the great utility of it to &s;ociety, and to the order, peace and happine&s;s of mankind. And its happy influence on &s;ociety, was probably one de&s;ign of our merciful Creator, in its in&s;titution. So we come,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="133" REF="028999_0126_0FDDD10109C367A8">
II. To &s;hew the advantages of the religious ob&s;er|vance of the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>ALL God's ordinances are wi&s;e and merciful, and intended for the be&s;t good and happine&s;s of mankind. This is e&s;pecially the ca&s;e in the ordinance of the &s;abbath. It is happily calculated for the be&s;t inter|i&s;ts of mankind, in this world, and in the world to come. Civil laws, with all the nece&s;&s;ary pains and penalties of di&s;obedience, cannot &s;o effectually pre|&s;erve the order, the harmony and happine&s;s of &s;ocie|ty, or re&s;train from immorality, as the religious ob|&s;ervance of the &s;abbath. And the rea&s;on is, that this divine in&s;titution, as it immediately re&s;pects God, takes hold of the con&s;cience, and regulates the principle of action, the life and conver&s;ation. But it is principally de&s;igned, to train up mankind, by divine in&s;truction, for the pure and perfect &s;ociety of the heavenly world, and for the everla&s;ting, holy and joyful &s;abbath, premi&s;ed to the faithful. A con&s;ideration of a few particulars will explain the wi&s;dom of the in&s;titution and advantages of the ob|&s;ervance of the &s;abbath.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE human frame requires re&s;t from the fa|tigues of labour, one day in &s;even. It is nece&s;&s;a|ry to recruit the exhau&s;ted &s;trength, and &s;pirits of the laborious part of our &s;pecies, that with renewed &s;trength and cheerfulne&s;s, man may go forth to his work and labour, thro' &s;ix days of the week. The I&s;raelites were commanded, not only to cea&s;e from labor, but to exact none from their &s;ervants, or any under their care. They were to recal to remem|brance, their rigorous &s;ervitude in Egypt, which they were compelled to perform on the &s;abbath, and all days, to their extreme grief.</P>
<P>To the humane, it is a plea&s;ing confideration, that this day is favourable to the comfort of the
<PB N="134" REF="028999_0127_0FDDD102C269D410">brutal creatures. They enjoy a re&s;t. They labor in the &s;ervice of mankind, &s;ix days of the week, and many of them meet with hard and cruel u&s;age, from their unmerciful owners. They are &s;ubjected to the vanity and caprice of men, not willingly; and groan for deliverance. It is to them a merciful law. "On the &s;eventh day, thou &s;halt re&s;t, that thine ox, and thine a&s;s may re&s;t, and that thy &s;er|vant, and the &s;tranger, may be refre&s;hed." The re&s;t of the &s;abbath is not a detriment to men's tem|poral intere&s;t: but on the contrary is promotive of it, as it affords renewed vigor to man and bea&s;t, to pur&s;ue the labours of the week. Labor without ce&s;&s;ation would de&s;troy the health and &s;horten the lives of men.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT cheri&s;hes and &s;upports the kind and &s;ocial affections. Tho' men may di&s;agree in all other points, they are united with a few exceptions, in the religious ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath. A whole people meeting together, at the place and &s;ea&s;on ap|pointed, to pay their acknowledgments of duty and obedience to God, &s;en&s;ible of their wants and de|pendence on God, and their mutual dependence al&s;o upon each other, and imploring the divine mercies for them&s;elves, their friends and fellow men; ne|ce&s;&s;arily unites men in bonds of mutual benevolence and love. To a&s;&s;emble, by the command of God, upon his holy day, to receive his ble&s;&s;ing, to con|template the glories of his perfections and works, to hear the &s;olemn and &s;ublime truths and duties re|vealed in his word, and to offer up devout &s;upplica|tions in prayer and prai&s;e, and &s;tanding as in the immediate pre&s;ence of the creator and parent of the univer&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;pirits, and the common benefactor of mankind, upon who&s;e bounty and ble&s;|&s;ing all are equally and forever dedendant: an in|&s;titution
<PB N="135" REF="028999_0128_0FDDD1045265A7E0">like this mu&s;t effect every heart, which is not uncommonly depraved, with noble and elevated &s;entiments, eradicate each low and malevolent thought, and in&s;pire the &s;oul with a benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition, towards his fellow wor&s;hippers, and all mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. PUBLIC wor&s;hip is a public &s;chool of know|ledge and virtue. The doctrines and practical prin|ciples of natural and revealed religion, are explained and enforced upon the con&s;ciences of men, in our wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;embles, on the &s;abbath. Its in&s;titu|tion habituates our minds to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the exi&s;tence, the pre&s;ence and perfections of God, and our accountablene&s;s to him. It impre&s;&s;es upon us the certainty of a &s;tate of final and eternal retribution, of felicity or mi&s;ery, according to our moral charac|ter. The Bible is the &s;acred oracle of the &s;abbath, and in the mini&s;tration of it, we are taught all that the Lord our God requires of us. What are tho&s;e &s;pecial duties which we owe to God, to one another, and to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BY the religious ob&s;ervance of this day, we arrive at the knowledge of the end of our creation, and the at|tainment of virtue and durable happine&s;s. A future &s;tate of exi&s;tence is a natural principle, but almo&s;t ex|tingui&s;hed among the rude nations of the world, by the prevalence of various lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions. The or|dinance of the &s;abbath is nece&s;&s;ary to keep alive this principle, and to call it into exerci&s;e. And where it is ob&s;erved, people &s;hew its happy fruits in the practice of the duties of piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash; The in&s;titution pre&s;erves the morals of a people, di&s;|po&s;ing them to things true, ju&s;t, hone&s;t and of good report. The enemies of revealed religion, tho&s;e wi&s;e philo&s;ophers of this world, have conceded to its
<PB N="136" REF="028999_0129_0FDDD105E2FDD708">advocates, the utility and advantages of the &s;abbath, as it re&s;pects the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath is nece&s;&s;ary to up|hold vi&s;ible religion and morality. This is confirm|ed by rea&s;on and ob&s;ervation. In tho&s;e places in which the &s;abbath is not religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, igno|rance, ill manners and vices abound. The inhabi|tants are generally idle, profane and contentious, and ripen them&s;elves for divine corrections. Tho&s;e who reject divine in&s;titutions, and the wor&s;hip and fear of God, are de&s;titute of an efficient principle of righteou&s;ne&s;s towards men. "For they who fear not God, neither will they regard man." Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, have no re&s;traint from the &s;upreme pur&s;uit of their own intere&s;t or plea&s;ure; and to the accompli&s;hment of their &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, all things are made &s;ub&s;ervient. A &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition ab&s;orbs the judgment and the pa&s;&s;ions, and they are lovers of plea&s;ure, more than lovers of God.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;olemn con&s;ideration, which &s;hould par|ticularly arre&s;t the &s;erious attention of parents; that a vicious and ungodly life u&s;ually commences with the profanation of the &s;abbath. And on the other hand, tho&s;e who have been taught from early life, to attend to the &s;acred duties of this day, have gen|erally retained a regard to virtue and religion, thro' life. Allow me to mention, what has been often ob|&s;erved, that of the &s;mall number of criminals, who have come to untimely deaths, by the hand of public ju&s;|tice in this part of the country, perhaps the greater part, have dated the beginning of the crimes, which brought them there, from their neglect and profa|nation of the &s;abbath, in younger life.</P>
<P>As &s;erious parents would &s;hudder at the thought
<PB N="137" REF="028999_0130_0FDDD10A8D570230">of their children's growing up in ignorance of God, and becoming examples of vice and mi&s;ery in this world, and of perdition in the world to come; as they &s;hould fear le&s;t the guilt of their blood, be re|quired at their hands, to whom God has committed their children as a &s;olemn charge, to be educated to know, to love and &s;erve him forever: as they wi&s;h them to be good, u&s;eful and happy in life, and ble&s;&s;ed beyond the grave; they will not neglect to teach them by precept and example, the &s;olemn and important duty of remembering and keeping the holy &s;abbath.</P>
<P>THE ancient chri&s;tians called the &s;abbath the queen of days, and choice&s;t of the &s;even, becau&s;e God has con&s;ecrated it, as the medium of &s;piritual and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings; becau&s;e the &s;oul is purified and elevated by the &s;tudy and contemplation of the &s;ublime&s;t and be&s;t objects, attains to the knowledge and dignity of its nature, and enjoys the manife&s;|tations of the love and mercies of God, who makes his children joyful in his hou&s;e of prayer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, with a&s;king your &s;erious attention and earne&s;t enquiry, after tho&s;e &s;piritual privileges and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings, which God gives to tho&s;e who with pious believing &s;ouls, &s;anctify his holy day. The ordinances of this day are the &s;pecial mean of communicating to our &s;ouls, the ble&s;&s;ings of eternal &s;alvation. God has &s;anctified and ble&s;&s;ed the day to this end. He honors the ordinances of his appointment. "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the private dwellings of his people." There he meets the &s;inner, with illuminating and convincing influ|ences of his word and &s;pirit, and turns his feet from the path of death and ruin, into the way of holine&s;s and life. The humble &s;oul convinced of &s;in and in|quiring
<PB N="138" REF="028999_0131_0FDDD10C5EF13FD8">for &s;alvation, there hears the voice of par|doning mercy, &s;aying, "Son be of good cheer, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee." There the &s;incere be|liever, finds light and direction in duty, his faith confirmed, his hopes and con&s;olations revived, and his &s;oul filled with a divine peace, and &s;ome happy earne&s;t of the unclouded joys, which are laid up for the ju&s;t, beyond the vale of death.</P>
<P>SINCE God has graciou&s;ly in&s;tituted the holy Sabbath, as a &s;pecial &s;ea&s;on of grace and &s;alvation, and made it our duty to ob&s;erve it; let us, my friends and fellow-wor&s;hippers, mo&s;t gladly and gratefully improve the golden &s;ea&s;on, with humble dependence on heavenly grace, and not neglect the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together, for our edification and comfort in holine&s;s, unto eternal life, thro' Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>

<P>I AM now to &s;hew that the religious ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath, is an ordinance of the go&s;pel&mdash; to explain the &s;pecial duties of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, and the acceptable manner of performing them.</P>
<P>As the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was the glo|rious fini&s;hing act of redemption, and in its miracul|ous nature, its connection with antecedent predic|tions, and &s;ub&s;equent events, more than all things el&s;e, confirmed the divinity of his mi&s;&s;ion, and al|mightine&s;s to &s;ave; the apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples, by divine direction, in&s;tituted the day, on the morning of which, he ro&s;e from the dead, to be ob&s;erved, in honor of their ri&s;en Lord. And altho' there is no expre&s;s precept in the go&s;pel, for the change from the &s;eventh, to the fir&s;t day of the week, <HI>their</HI> exam|ple is a &s;ufficient warrant, and in all re&s;pects tanta|mount to a po&s;itive precept; becau&s;e in all things relative to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the chri&s;tian church and wor&s;hip, they were divinely directed.</P>
<P>FROM the creation, to the redemption of the church of God from Egypt, the &s;eventh day was ob|&s;erved
<PB N="140" REF="028999_0133_0FDDD113CF1D9930">as the &s;abbath: but after that, Mo&s;es the in|&s;pired lawgiver of the Jewi&s;h church, gives another rea&s;on for the &s;abbath, which was the redemption of I&s;rael. And probably its date was e&s;tabli&s;hed at that great event. When our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t had &s;ini&s;hed the work of redemption, a work more glori|ous than the creation of the material univer&s;e, and of which the deliverance of I&s;rael, was a lively type or figure, the apo&s;tles and primitive di&s;ciples chang|ed the &s;abbath, to the day of his re&s;urrection. And that day, the fir&s;t day of the week, has been inva|riably kept by the body of the chri&s;tian church, from the days of the apo&s;tles, to the pre&s;ent time. Several things mentioned in the go&s;pel hi&s;tory &s;hew that the day was changed.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples immediately after our Lord's re&s;urrection, began the cu&s;tom of a&s;&s;embling together, for the purpo&s;es of religious wor&s;hip, upon the fir&s;t day of the week. And with the change of the day, the name was changed from <HI>&s;abbath</HI> to <HI>Lord's day,</HI> in commemoration of the triumphant re&s;urrection of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Chri&s;t him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to &s;anctify it, by his per&s;onal appearance, and meet|ing with his di&s;ciples on that day, repeatedly before his a&s;cen&s;ion. On the day on which he aro&s;e, he appeared to his a&s;&s;embled di&s;ciples and ble&s;&s;ed them. "Then the &s;ame day at evening, being the fir&s;t day of the week, when the doors were &s;hut, where the di&s;ciples were a&s;&s;embled, for fear of the Jews, Je|&s;us came and &s;tood in the mid&s;t, and &s;aid unto them, peace be unto you." Again they a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ucceeding fir&s;t day of the week, and Je&s;us met with them, and ble&s;&s;ed them. During the forty days of his continuance on earth, after his re&s;urrection, he u&s;ually appeared to his di&s;ciples, a&s;&s;embled for reli|gious wor&s;hip, on the fir&s;t day of the week. And
<PB N="141" REF="028999_0134_0FDDD11650525458">no doubt they received his expre&s;s direction, to ob|&s;erve it forever, as the day of the &s;olemn and joyful &s;olemnities of the chri&s;tian church. And when we reflect on the glory and greatne&s;s of the work ac|compli&s;hed, by the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, we &s;ee abundant cau&s;e, why the day &s;hould be made the chri&s;tian &s;abbath. The wonderful nature of this work, the ble&s;&s;ed and exten&s;ive effects and benefits of it, in the redemption of a lo&s;t world, bringing "glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, and good will to men;" and the divine greatne&s;s of the agent, renders it altogether a work exceeding in glory, any thing which has come to our know|ledge. And the day which compleated this work, and "&s;aw the Lord ari&s;e," merits to be honored as the day of our religious &s;olemnities, the holy jubilee of the chri&s;tian church: a day which the Lord hath made, and in which we will be glad, with &s;acred joy and wonder, gratitude and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, the apo&s;tles and the chri&s;tian church kept the fir&s;t day as the &s;abbath. St. Paul on his way to Macedonia, vi&s;ited the chri&s;|tians at Troas, and there abode &s;even days, "and upon the <HI>fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them.</HI>" That they met &s;tatedly, and by divine appointment on that day, further appears from the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. "Now concerning the collection for the &s;aints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even &s;o do ye, upon the <HI>fir&s;t day</HI> of the week, let every one of you lay by him in &s;tore, as God hath pro&s;pered him, that there be no gather|ings when I come." The&s;e examples teach us that the day of our Lord's re&s;urrection, was the &s;abbath of the di&s;ciples and primitive chri&s;tians. It was &s;anctified by the wonderful effu&s;ions of the holy &s;pi|rit
<PB N="142" REF="028999_0135_0FDDD117BA58B8C8">on the di&s;ciples. I was, &s;ays St. John, in the &s;pirit, on the <HI>Lord's day.</HI> The day was named <HI>&s;un|day,</HI> by pagan nations, becau&s;e on that day, they wor&s;hipped the &s;un. And for another rea&s;on it was &s;ometimes called by the &s;ame name by chri&s;tians, even becau&s;e on that day, the glorious &s;un of right|eou&s;ne&s;s aro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the fourth chapter of the Hebrews, the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the change of the &s;abbath from the patriarchal, to the chri&s;tian, by the name of a <HI>re&s;t.</HI> That the prophetic p&s;almi&s;t, in the ninety fifth p&s;alm, &s;peaks of a future re&s;t to be given to the church of God; which re&s;t could not mean the &s;e|venth day of the creation, nor the re&s;t of the earthly Canaan, becau&s;e the&s;e were pa&s;t, ages before, he therefore &s;peaks of a re&s;t to come, which no doubt is intended primarily of the heavenly re&s;t, but inclu|&s;ively, the re&s;t of the chri&s;tian &s;abbath. This will appear by a careful attention to the rea&s;oning of the apo&s;tle. "For if Jo&s;hua had given them re&s;t, then would he, (the p&s;almi&s;t) not have &s;poken afterwards of <HI>another day.</HI> There remaineth therefore, a (&s;ab|bati&s;mos) a &s;abbath, or re&s;t to the people of God." That the weekly &s;abbath is included, and that the day is the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, appears by the words following. "For he that is entered into his re&s;t, he al&s;o hath cea&s;ed from his own works as God did from his." The "certain day, limited" for the future re&s;t of believers, of which the p&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks, by the argument of the apo&s;tle, points out the day on which Je&s;us Chri&s;t fini&s;hed the work of redemption, or the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, typical of the heavenly re&s;t. For then he was relea&s;ed from all the demands which the law had again&s;t him, as the &s;ub&s;titute of offenders, having "fini&s;hed the work, which he came to do." And to celebrate the glo|rious
<PB N="143" REF="028999_0136_0FDDD11D5F266168">work of redemption is now the &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;abbath, not however excluding the celebra|tion of the wonderful works of creation, and the de|liverances wrought for the church, in ancient and later times.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE redeemer of his church claims the pre|rogative of e&s;tabli&s;hing the day, which we are to ob&s;erve. <HI>The &s;on of man is Lord, even of the &s;abbath.</HI> "To him &s;hall every knee bow and every tongue confe&s;s." As the ancient &s;abbath was a &s;ign be|tween Jehovah and the church of I&s;rael, that the Creator of the heavens and the earth was their God. and they his people: &s;o the chri&s;tan &s;abbath, is now al&s;o a &s;ign, or te&s;timonial that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the almighty redeemer of his people, whom they are to wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;abbath is a moral law, and therefore not &s;et a&s;ide by the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation as the ceremonial laws were. To the arguments already adduced in &s;upport of its moral obligation, we may ob&s;erve that it was in&s;tituted in paradi&s;e, before a &s;aviour was promi&s;ed or needed, and therefore was neither mo|&s;aic, nor ceremonial, nor typical of Chri&s;t, in its original in&s;titution. The ends to be an&s;wered by it, are moral; the refre&s;hment of our nature from the burdens of life, and our increa&s;e in knowledge and piety, and the celebration of the wonderful works of God, in creation and redemption. It is a perpetual law. Our Lord addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;ciples on the de&s;truction which was to come on Jeru&s;alem, which happened in about forty years after his a&s;cen|&s;ion, directs them to pray that their flight fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the impending de&s;olation might not be on the &s;abbath day.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="028999_0137_0FDDD1201ADA0DD0">
IT appears by the writings of St. Paul, and of the fathers who lived in or near the age of the apo&s;|tles, that &s;ome jewi&s;h chri&s;tians, ob&s;erved both the jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian &s;abbath.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IGNATIUS, who lived in the apo&s;tolic age, exhorts the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians, to keep the Lord's day, as the &s;abbath of the chri&s;tian church. And Ju&s;tin Martyr, who lived &s;oon after Ignatius, a&s;&s;erts that it was the practice of chri&s;tians univer&s;al|ly, to a&s;&s;emble the fir&s;t, or Lord's day, to pray, to hear the word, receive the &s;acraments and devoutly &s;ing God's prailes.</NOTE> But the jewi&s;h &s;ab|bath came gradually into di&s;u&s;e, and the chri&s;tian was &s;oon univer&s;ally ob&s;erved, by jews and gentiles.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;een that the Lord's day, is di|vinely in&s;tituted as the chri&s;tian &s;abbath; it is an inquiry of great importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT are its &s;pecial duties, and the manner of their acceptable performance. By the mild di&s;|pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, brought to the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the chri&s;tian church, are not obliged to ob&s;erve the &s;abbath with &s;o much &s;trictne&s;s and rigor, as were the ancient church. Some things of &s;mall con&s;equence on other days, if done on the &s;abbath, were capitally puni&s;hed. The &s;trict and rigid di&s;cipline of the &s;abbath, was impo&s;ed upon the jews, becau&s;e of their &s;mall attainments in &s;pi|ritual under&s;tanding, and becau&s;e they were a peo|ple of an untoward and di&s;obedient temper. They were &s;trictly forbidden impo&s;ing any work upon their children, &s;ervants and cattle on the &s;abbath; becau&s;e they were a people eager to accumulate wealth, and would otherwi&s;e have obliged them to unremitting &s;ervitude. The &s;abbath was therefore &s;trictly and mercifully in&s;tituted, that all orders and conditions, might enjoy a re&s;pite from extreme &s;er|vice, and a favorable &s;ea&s;on, for religious know|ledge, contemplation and devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="028999_0138_0FDDD121EC7879C8">
THE chri&s;tian &s;abbath demands a more rational &s;piritual and &s;ublime &s;ervice, and is exempted from the mortifying &s;everity and di&s;cipline of the mo&s;aic. "For the yoke of Chri&s;t is ea&s;y, and his burden light." But to obtain, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the moral and divine purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="1">1. A ce&s;&s;ation from worldly labour and &s;ecular employments is nece&s;&s;ary. It is a day not only of re&s;t from labor, but of active &s;ervice, in the duties of public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip, and of private devo|tion. Tho&s;e worldly thoughts, plans and works, which are lawful on week days, are unlawful on the &s;abbath; becau&s;e an indulgence of them, would defeat the ble&s;&s;ed ends of its in&s;titution, which are principally that God may be vi&s;ibly and publicly glorified on earth, and our knowledge and &s;alvation promoted. Six days are allowed us, for worldly labor, and they are abundantly &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of health and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, but a &s;eventh part of our time, is con&s;ecrated to the Lord, to be employed in his wor&s;hip, and to our &s;piritual edifi|cation and comfort. Chri&s;tians are bound to re|member the &s;abbath day, and keep it holy. "Take heed to your&s;elves that ye bear no (unnece&s;&s;ary) bur|dens on the &s;abbath day&mdash;neither do ye any work, but hallow the &s;abbath, as I commanded your far|thers." We are commanded to re&s;t from our works, as God re&s;ted from his. As that was a holy re&s;t, &s;o &s;hould ours be. It is not a re&s;t of &s;loth or idlene&s;s, as &s;ome profane &s;inners imagine, and u&s;e it accordingly. The brutes ob&s;erve the day better than &s;uch thoughtle&s;s per&s;ons. Tho' the body is excu&s;ed from worldly labour, the mind has much to do, in devout meditation, reading, hearing, prayer and prai&s;e. The bodily exerci&s;e required on the &s;abbath is ea&s;y: to meet and unite with the wor|&s;hippers
<PB N="146" REF="028999_0139_0FDDD122F3A3CD88">of God in the &s;anctuary, and attend the duties of devotion in the family, and in &s;ecret. Works of charity and mercy are to be done on the &s;abbath, as well as other days. Our Lord gave &s;ight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, &s;trength to the decriped, and health to the &s;ick on the &s;abbath. And pa&s;&s;ing thro' a corn field, his di&s;ciples gather|ed the ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands, and eat them, to &s;atisfy hunger. The captious and &s;uper&s;titious phari&s;ees objected, that Chri&s;t profaned the &s;abbath by his works of mercy. Our Lord conde&s;cended to vindicate his good works, by the example of God the father, "&s;aying my father worketh hitherto, and I work." God works by his holy pre&s;erving and &s;u&s;taining providence, &s;up|plying the wants of his creatures, on the &s;abbath, and our Lord imitated the divine example, in works of mercy, on the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>To determine the lawfulne&s;s of doing any work on the &s;abbath, which comes under the name of <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> mu&s;t be taken into con&s;ideration, the expe|diency of the work, the length of time nece&s;&s;ary to do it, and the con&s;cience of the per&s;on, enlightened by the word of God.</P>
<P>WORKS or actions, &s;inful on other days, are more &s;inful committed on the &s;abbath; becau&s;e the day being the Lord's in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, and to be employed in holy duties, the guilt of &s;inful actions, is thereby greatly increa&s;ed. All &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion as well as &s;ins of commi&s;&s;ion, are to be &s;acredly guarded again&s;t on the &s;abbath. That we may meet with acceptance with God, in the a&s;&s;emblies of his wor&s;hippers, and have our hearts prepared to wait upon him, according to the preparation of the &s;anctuary, and wor&s;hip him, in the beauties of holi|ne&s;s; We are,</P>

We &s;hould go to the hou&s;e of God with a praying frame of &s;pirit, humbly imploring the pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing of God, on our purpo&s;es to wor&s;hip and obey him, and to receive the in&s;tructions of his will in all duty,&mdash;that he would pour out upon us, and upon our fellow-wor&s;hippers, the &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication&mdash; afford his &s;pirit and ble&s;&s;ing in the mini&s;tration of the word and ordinances, that they may be attended with light and comfort, and that it may be a good day to our &s;ouls.

<P>THE whole day is to be kept as holy time. A whole day, the &s;eventh part of time, was con&s;ecra|ted
<PB N="148" REF="028999_0141_0FDDD12915F8D8F0">at the creation. And altho' the day was chang|ed, it was not abridged. It is a moral law, and of perpetual obligation. The importance of the pre|cept is taught us, by the emphatical word <HI>remem|ber:</HI> and &s;hews us that the holy and profitable du|ties of the Lord's day, &s;hould be the plea&s;ing &s;ub|ject of our thoughts, thro' the days of the week; that we meditate upon it before it comes, and recal it to mind after it is pa&s;t, that &s;o the good fruits of this ble&s;&s;ed in&s;titution, may abide in our hearts, and appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our lives.

<P>THE &s;abbath is profaned by the neglect of &s;erious con&s;ideration, and preparation for its approach&mdash;by &s;pending the day or any part of it in idlene&s;s in the hou&s;e, or in &s;auntering abroad, or in the fields&mdash;by wa&s;ting its &s;acred morning in &s;leep, on which Je&s;us aro&s;e early for our &s;alvation.&mdash;It is profaned by de|vi&s;ing plans of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;by &s;ettling accounts &mdash;writing letters&mdash;and reading books which have not a relation to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day. It is pro|faned by tho&s;e who ab&s;ent them&s;elves, from the wor|&s;hip and ordinances of the day, for trifling rea&s;ons&mdash; by tho&s;e who excu&s;e them&s;elves with the plea, that they can read good books at home; thus de&s;pi&s;ing the hou&s;e of God, and &s;etting their own wi&s;dom above the wi&s;dom of God, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed his church as the ground and pillar of the truth. Can &s;uch proud and wilful neglecters, expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God? Will their idle pleas avail at the bar of final and eter|nal judgment? It is profaned by tho&s;e who are hypocritical, who externally wor&s;hip, while their heart goeth after their covetou&s;ne&s;s, or their fen&s;ual

To the&s;e de&s;criptions of thoughtle&s;s, irreligi|ous wor&s;hippers, are addre&s;&s;ed the words of Chri&s;t, "Ye hypocrites, well did E&s;aias prophecy of you, &s;aying this people draweth nigh to me, with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."</P>
<P>FOR our encouragement to &s;anctify the &s;abbath there are precious promi&s;es, of ble&s;&s;ings &s;piritual and temporal. God richly recompences the people who honor him on earth, in the con&s;ciencious ob&s;ervance of his &s;acred day. The heathen who wor&s;hip not God, peri&s;h under his frowns; but his vi&s;ible cove|nant people, he builds up and ble&s;&s;es. Then do we improve the &s;abbath mo&s;t profitably, when we devoutly u&s;e its holy ordinances, as the divine chan|nel of communication of &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. On the morning of this day Je&s;us Chri&s;t fini&s;hed the work of our redemption, and on this day we are e&s;pecially encouraged to a&s;k and &s;eek for the &s;av|ing benefits of his grace, in pardon, ju&s;tification, peace and acceptance with God, and a title to the high privileges of adopted children, and heirs of the heavenly inheritance. All tho&s;e happy &s;ouls who a&s;k with humble penitence, and unfeigned faith, have the promi&s;e that they &s;hall obtain; and the almighty father of mercies will make them joyful in his hou&s;e of prayer.

Next to God, our parents claim our reverence, love and obedience. They are in God's &s;tead to children. As parents and children are mutually dependent on God; children are e&s;pecially dependent on their parents.</P>
<P>THIS precept is the mo&s;t important of tho&s;e of the &s;econd table of the law, and therefore placed fir&s;t: for to him, who fulfils the obligations of filial piety, the duties which he owes to mankind, which are enumerated in the &s;ucceeding laws of the decalogue, will be ea&s;y and plea&s;ant. For he who is loving and dutiful to his parents, will be ju&s;t, righteous and merciful to mankind. And on the other hand a di&s;regard of parental authority, and an ungrateful neglect and abu&s;e of parents, is the fulle&s;t proof of a depraved and vicious heart, prepared when op|portunities
<PB N="154" REF="028999_0146_0FDDD1344BBE7840">and temptations invite, for the perpe|tration of all tho&s;e crimes, which the remaining pre|cepts &s;olemnly prohibit, by the &s;evere&s;t penalties.</P>
<P>FILIAL piety is the ba&s;is of all &s;ocial and relative duties and virtues. It forms a habit from youthful days, which tempations to wickedne&s;s cannot ea&s;ily eradicate. As filial obedience begi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in infancy and continues thro' life, the Deity is plea&s;ed to give it a place at the head of all tho&s;e duties which we owe to mankind. Other moral obligations are included in this precept, and grafted on the &s;tock of filial piety. They will be noticed in their order. I &s;hall attempt to &s;hew, the obligations and duties of chil|dren to their parents&mdash;The duties of parents to their children&mdash;The various &s;ocial and relative duties of life&mdash;And the animating motives to filial piety, contained in the promi&s;e which God hath given to them who honor their parents.</P>
<P>"HONOR thy father and thy mother." The word honor, in this place is of exten&s;ive &s;ignifica|tion, and implies that we reverence and love their per&s;ons, obey their lawful commands, and labor to promote their intere&s;ts and happine&s;s, by all &s;uita|ble means. It comprehends all the duties and offi|ces of filial piety. The word is al&s;o u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duties which we owe to our civil rulers, the po|litical fathers of the people. The command "<HI>hon|or</HI> the king," implies all the duties which men owe to the government, which they are under. It is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the mutual duties and obligations of mankind in all &s;ocial relations.&mdash;"Render to all their due, tribute to whom tribute, (is due) <HI>honor</HI> to whom honor."</P>
<P>THE obedience of children to parents, has ob|tained
<PB N="155" REF="028999_0147_0FDDD135B7F11738">the name of <HI>filial piety,</HI> becau&s;e if faithfully done, and from a right principle, it is an important branch of that religion, which is good and accepta|ble to God, and which he will graciou&s;ly and abun|dantly reward.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE duty of children to parents, is to reve|rence and love their per&s;ons. They &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial regard for them and expre&s;s it, by all &s;uit|able words and actions. Altho' their parents may not be &s;o worthy as others, yet are children bound to &s;hew them greater re&s;pect than others. This obligation is not di&s;annulled, altho' the parents might be vicious and profane. For, under God, they are the authors of their exi&s;tence. Had it not been for them, children would never have been. They have tenderly cheri&s;hed and cared for them in their infantile helple&s;s days, and reared them up to youth and manhood. The obligations are &s;till greater to worthy and virtuous parents, becau&s;e chil|dren have received more kindne&s;s and favors from them. In childhood, in youth, and before chil|dren arrive to the age of di&s;cretion, or to act for them&s;elves, they are under the ab&s;olute government of their parents, and are to obey them in all things, except in things immoral or &s;inful. And after they have attained to the age of manhood and are in a capacity to act for them&s;elves, they are &s;till bound to re&s;pect and reverence them, and &s;eek their com|fort and happine&s;s in all re&s;pects. They are obliged to conform them&s;elves to the rules and regulations of their fathers' family; to bear their proportion of labor for the &s;upport of the family: and when the parents become helple&s;s by age or infirmity, they are to provide for them; to &s;trive to make their condition as comfortable as may be, by kind and tender behaviour and dutiful expre&s;&s;ions; to bear
<PB N="156" REF="028999_0148_0FDDD13B37A87578">with their infirmities, and their unfa&s;hionable beha|viour, and ways, tho' contrary to the notions of children. A principle of gratitude to parents for all their former kindne&s;&s;es, and the laws of chri&s;tian|ity, oblige children to this duty. And tho&s;e in|firmities which frequently attend old age, children above all others ought to bear with meekne&s;s and patience; for if parents, broken by age and infirm|ities, do not meet with that indulgence, from their children which their condition requires, they cannot expect to find it from any others. There is in chil|dren a natural affection and gratitude towards their parents, which prompts them to &s;upport and com|fort them in old age. Tho&s;e who treat their help|le&s;s parents with neglect and di&s;re&s;pect, are condem|ned by the world as void of every human and gener|ous principle, as violaters of the moral and chri&s;tian law, in one of its mo&s;t important precepts, and as brutes in human &s;hape.</P>
<P>FILIAL piety is &s;een in the mo&s;t amiable light, when children exert every kind office to rai&s;e and comfort their parents, when by the providence of God they are overwhelmed with poverty, &s;ickne&s;s or other afflictions.</P>
<P>HOW nobly did this virtue appear in the conduct of the pious youth Jo&s;eph in Egypt, towards his venerable and afflicted father Jacob! Tho' exalted to all the honors of earthly grandeur, he was not unmindful of his aged father, &s;uffering the horrors of famine in a di&s;tant land. With child-like love and tenderne&s;s he &s;ent for him, brought him down to Egypt, fed him with bread, and comforted his declining years. It was no doubt the happie&s;t cir|cum&s;tance of his life, that God gave him that op|portunity to comfort his helple&s;s parent, and &s;up|port his tottering &s;teps down the hill of life.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="028999_0149_0FDDD13D62F927D0">
THE dutiful child is not a&s;hamed of the low con|dition of his parent in the world. His re&s;pect and reverence are not le&s;&s;ened. He endeavours by all laudable means to better his condition, and is mo&s;t grieved, when it is not in his power to afford relief. We have an example of dutiful reverence to a pa|rent, in King Solomon, to his aged mother. She came to a&s;k a favor of the King, her &s;on "and the king ro&s;e up to meet her, and bowed him&s;elf to her, and &s;at down on his throne, and cau&s;ed a &s;eat to be &s;et for the king's mother: and &s;he &s;at on his right hand." 1 Kings ii, 19. For his filial piety, and other virtues, heaven remarkably ble&s;&s;ed and pro&s;pered him. The rever&s;e of this we &s;ee in the treatment which aged Noah, in an unguarded hour, received from his profane &s;on Ham. The divine di&s;plea&s;ure followed on the heels of his undutiful|ne&s;s, and the cur&s;e of heaven fell upon him and his remote po&s;terity. God ble&s;&s;ed the two elder bro|thers Shem and Japhet, for their re&s;pect to their un|happy father.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is the duty of children to receive and obey the councils and in&s;tructions, and to &s;ubmit to the reproofs and corrections of parents. Parents have lived longer in the world, and have pa&s;&s;ed thro' tho&s;e trying &s;cenes of life, thro' which their chil|dren have to pa&s;s; they are therefore qualified to guide them. They may have ta&s;ted the bitter fruits of youthful inexperience and folly, and &s;mart|ed under the wounds of the &s;ins of their youth, until they turned their feet into the paths of rectitude and virtue. Or if they have happily, thro' the re&s;train|ing grace and good providence of God, e&s;caped the &s;nares of temptations, they have &s;een the rocks on which others have made &s;hipwreck, and are there|fore &s;kilful pilots, to tho&s;e who have ju&s;t launched
<PB N="158" REF="028999_0150_0FDDD13ED684FFD8">on the &s;ea of life, &s;trangers to the dangers of the ocean over which they are to &s;hape their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>PARENTS who have known by &s;weet experience, the plea&s;ures of early piety, can recommend to the young a life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> religion, as their chief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nament, dignity and &s;ecurity: and their councils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill be re|commended by the efficacy of a good example. Wi&s;dom &s;hould dwell with years; and happy is the youth who profits by the in&s;tructions and virtuous example of his parents. Thus did a wi&s;e and pious Mo&s;es, who&s;e youth had been formed by the max|ims of religion, the only true and durable wi&s;dom. "He harkened to the voice of his father-in-law Je|thro," and found much advantage and comfort in following the advice of his wi&s;er parent.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are meekly to &s;ubmit to parental cor|rection, for their faults. They are to con&s;ider that the ta&s;k is painful to the affectionate parent; and their good and happine&s;s is the motive and the mea&s;ure of correction and the &s;everity of di&s;cipline. "We have had fathers of the fle&s;h, who corrected us, and we did them reverence." Children are carefully to avoid a repetition of tho&s;e faults which de&s;erve correction, and to plea&s;e their parents in all dutiful and virtuous behaviour.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is the duty of children to obey all lawful commands of their parents. As children are de|pendent on their parents, they are &s;ubjected to their lawful authority. This law of nature is enforced by the precepts of chri&s;tianity. "Children obey your parents in all things; for this is well plea&s;ing unto the Lord." While children are under the govern|ment of parents, implicit filial obedience is due, whether they command them to do this, or the
<PB N="159" REF="028999_0151_0FDDD14038115908">other labor or &s;ervice. They are to come or go at the parents bidding. Obedience to all the com|mands of parents, is to be under&s;tood with the re|&s;triction of things lawful. Children are not to obey, if a parent &s;hould be &s;o unnatural as to command any thing unlawful or &s;inful, as to &s;teal, to lie, to prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the name of God, and the like. Neither are they to obey, if commanded to ab&s;tain from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;o&s;e duties or lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs which God has commanded, &s;uch as reading the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rayer, attendance on public wor&s;hip and the like. They are not to obey in the&s;e ca&s;es, becau&s;e the authority of God is above the authority of parents, and we are to obey God rather than man, in all ca&s;es in which tho&s;e authorities interfere. The apo&s;tle qualifies the gen|eral rule of filial duty, "with things which are good and right and well plea&s;ing to God:" and in &s;uch things the parents' authority is ab&s;olute. "Chil|dren obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right." It is right or agreeable to the light of nature. It mu&s;t be "in the Lord," or agreeable to his revealed will.</P>
<P>IN obeying parental authority, all meekne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion are to be &s;hewn; without murmuring, gain&s;aying or contradiction. Children are to pay a willing and cheerful obedience; performing all filial duty, heartily as unto the Lord, con&s;idering their parents as in God's &s;tead to them. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of children's reverencing their parents, even when they correct them. "They corrected us, and we did them reverence." Thus children are taught their obligation to obey with fidelity and cheerful|ne&s;s all lawful commands, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to yield to the reproofs and corrections of their parents.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is their duty to provide for their parents. Gratitude obliges them to make all &s;uitable returns
<PB N="160" REF="028999_0152_0FDDD1465ED12CE8">for the love, the care, the watchfulne&s;s and kindne&s;s which parents have be&s;towed on them. They &s;hould admini&s;ter to their temporal wants whenever their dircum&s;tances call for it. The obligations of child|ren both to their father and their mother, are equal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y binding, and to be fulfiled equally to both. Child|ren can never requite them for their kindne&s;s, either the father's, in providing for them when young, weak and helple&s;s; or the mother's, for all her pains, anxieties and &s;orrows; the &s;leeple&s;s houts, and watchings, the homely offices done for them, and all her cea&s;ele&s;s cares and labors for them thro' all periods of infancy and childhood. To them, under God, they owe their life and health, food, raiment and education: and nature teaches them that when &s;uch friends and benefactors, are reduced either by the accidents of providence, to poverty and dependence, or when di&s;abled by the infirmities of age, to provide for their own comfort, that &s;upport and comfort &s;hould be liberally and cheerfully afforded them by their children. Thus a pious Jo&s;eph nouri&s;hed his aged father in Egypt, in a time of famine. The ancient Jews had a &s;aying, that children ought to work with their hands to provide for their parents, and to beg for them when they have nothing of their own to give.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are to provide for the comfort of par|ents when &s;ick&mdash;when deprived of rea&s;on and help|le&s;s. The con&s;olation of aged people depends much upon the duty and kindne&s;s of children towards them. It is more to them than earthly enjoyments, and next to tho&s;e divine con&s;olations which religion gives, in the hope of a better life beyond the vale of death. We have a remarkable in&s;tance of filial duty and affection, in the two daughters in-law of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, particularly in a virtuous Ruth, towards her afflicted
<PB N="161" REF="028999_0153_0FDDD149F488F980">and di&s;con&s;olate parent. "She &s;aid to her mother, whither thou goe&s;t I will go, and where thou lodge&s;t I will lodge, thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou die&s;t, I will die, and there will I be buried, and nought but death &s;halt part me and thee." The duty of providing for parents extends to children-in-la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and to grand|children. Of the grand&s;on of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mi, it is &s;aid, "he &s;hall be unto thee a re&s;torer of thy life, and a nouri&s;her of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law which loveth thee, who is better to thee, than &s;even &s;ons, hath borne him."</P>
<P>CHILDREN ought to put the mo&s;t favorable con|&s;truction upon the words and actions of parents&mdash;to vindicate their reputation&mdash;defend them from in|juries&mdash;and not willingly &s;ee or hear any thing to their di&s;advantage. The two &s;ons of Noah when their father overtaken with wine, expo&s;ed his naked|ne&s;s, took a garment, and with filial reverence, went backward and covered him. And for this in&s;tance of duty, God ble&s;&s;ed and pro&s;pered them.</P>
<P>OUR Lord reproves and condemns the injurious and vile conduct of the jews in their neglect of their aged helple&s;s parents. The law of Mo&s;es had de|creed that children &s;hould provide for them; but they found means hypocritically to evade the law. By con&s;ecrating a &s;mall part of their intere&s;t to the u&s;e of the temple, their phara&s;aical teachers di&s;&s;olved them from filial obligation. "They tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the commandment of God by their tradition; for God commanded &s;aying, honor thy father and thy mother; and he that cur&s;eth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye &s;ay who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay to his father or mother, it is a gift, by what&s;oever thou mighte&s;t be profited by me, and honor not (does
<PB N="162" REF="028999_0154_0FDDD14B776BCA38">not provide for) his father, or his mother, he &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> free" Thus by the injurious law of their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> they excu&s;ed them&s;elves from this great natural duty. Let us now,</P>
<P N="2">2. INQUIRE what are the duties of parents to their children.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN the helple&s;s &s;tages of infancy, the whole care of children i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> devolved on the parents. They are part of them, and to be loved and cheri&s;hed as their own fle&s;h. God commits them to parents, and plants in their nature the &s;trong ties of affec|tion, and &s;ends the nutricious aliment into the mother's brea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> feed them. To her their tender age is e&s;pecially committed; and the father is bound to provide for the mother and the child. The author of nature has imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted this natural affection in the parents brea&s;t, attaching to them, by indi&s;&s;o|luble bonds, their helple&s;s offspring. "Can a wo|man forget her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucking child, that &s;he &s;hould not have compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;on of her w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mb?" Rare indeed are in&s;tances of &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">natural neglect.</P>
<P N="2">2. At &s;oon as children are capable of being taught, the parents duty is to in&s;til into their open|ing minds, the le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction in knowledge and virtue. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th and duty &s;hould be early taught them, both by precept and example. In plain and familiar language adapted to their under&s;tanding, they are to be in the knowledge of God, the univer|&s;al creator and parent&mdash;the knowledge of them&s;elves &mdash;their unhappy condition by &s;in&mdash;the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of repentence&mdash;prayer and obedience&mdash; the mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ful provi&s;ion made for their &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and other important and plain truths nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation. They are to be in|&s;tructed
<PB N="163" REF="028999_0155_0FDDD15212C03F48">repeatedly, and with patient per&s;everence, that the principles of u&s;eful knowledge, virtue and piety may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in their minds, and produce their good and u&s;eful fruit in their future life. The &s;alutary effects of early in&s;truction are la&s;ting. "Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." The foundation of a virtuous and u&s;eful life is laid in childhood. The ble&s;&s;ing of God, on early in&s;truc|tion, parents are encouraged to hope for: and for that ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould they with pious ardor pray, while they labor to fulfil this duty to their beloved offspring. "Fathers provo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and ad|monition of the Lord."</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is the parents duty to reclaim their children from faults and follies, by reproof and correction. A propen&s;ity to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of duty, and re|&s;i&s;t the &s;alutary re&s;traints of religion and virtue, alas, but too generally appears in our fir&s;t entrance into this depraved world. "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it from him." On the appearance of a vicious in|clination in children, the rod &s;hould accompany re|proof. "The rod and reproof give wi&s;dom; but a child left to him&s;elf, bringeth his mother to &s;hame." Correction &s;hould be tempered with wi&s;dom; and never admini&s;tered ha&s;tily, or to gratify the parent's &s;udden and pa&s;&s;ionate re&s;entment. The child &s;hould fir&s;t be convinced of his fault, and the ju&s;tice of his puni&s;hment, and that it is the effect, not of pa&s;&s;ion, but of rea&s;on and love.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t pious and eminent families on &s;acred record, in&s;truction and government were maintained. Of the illu&s;trious family of Abraham, the Mo&s;t
<PB N="164" REF="028999_0156_0FDDD1530D11C3A0">High gives this commendation, "He will com|mand his children and his hou&s;hold after him, that they &s;hall keep the ways of the Lord and do ju&s;tice and judgment." By too great indulgence at the vices of his &s;ons, the judgments of heaven fell heavily on the hou&s;e of Eli.</P>
<P>AFTER training up their children in knowledge and virtue, and the duties which they owe to God and to mankind; thus qualifying them, by the ble&s;|&s;ing of God to be good and u&s;eful, parents are to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, according to their ability, in &s;ome com|fortable and u&s;eful profe&s;&s;ion or imployment&mdash;in the world. And in doing this they &s;hould con&s;ult the genius and inclinations of children, and put them in|to &s;uch a cour&s;e of life, as &s;hall afford the be&s;t pro&s;|pect of their &s;erving their generation to God's ac|ceptance.</P>
<P>PARENTS who neglect to provide, in the be&s;t man|ner in their power for their children's u&s;efulne&s;s in this life, and for their immortal happine&s;s are con|demned by an in&s;pired apo&s;tle. "If any man pro|vide not for his own, and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own hou&s;e, he hath denied the faith and is wor&s;e than an infidel." The obligations of parents extend to children in law, and to adopted children, equally with their own.</P>
<P>BUT the principal care and labor of parents &s;hould be to &s;ave the &s;ouls of their beloved offspring. To qualify them for the adoption of children into the family of God, and hou&s;hold of faith; that at the la&s;t great day, when parents with their children &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled before the throne of univer&s;al judg|ment, and give up their account to God, they may be able to &s;ay, thro' divine grace attending and &s;uc|ceeding

May it plea&s;e God of his mercy to grant that this may be the happy condition of all of us parents and children, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the almigh|ty lover of the children of men; to whom be honor and glory now and ever.</P>

<P>IN this comprehen&s;ive precept, the duty of chil|dren to their parents is commanded: this is however but one important particular of many duties intended; and is placed at the head of other rela|tive obligations, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t weighty of any, e&s;pecially as it prepares men for the faithful performance of all relative duty to mankind.</P>
<P>HE who loves and honors his parents, is likely to do well in all the relations of life. Having &s;hewn the mutual duties of parents and children, let us now,</P>
<P N="3">3. INQUIRE into the nature and obligations of other important, relative and &s;ocial connections. Allow me to mention,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE mutual duties which combine the mar|riage relation, and exi&s;t between the hu&s;band and the wife. As benevolence or virtuous love is the
<PB N="168" REF="028999_0159_0FDDD1570715A110">principle of all relative duty, and the fulfiling the whole of this table of the law, it appears in no one connection in life, more important and nece&s;&s;ary, than in the intimate and endearing connection of hu&s;band and wife. The tendere&s;t love and kinde&s;t u&s;age, is due from the hu&s;band to the wife. To her &s;hould be given all willing and cheerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to alleviate her troubles and bear her &s;orrows; and by good example and wi&s;e in&s;tructions to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the promotion of her happine&s;s in this life, and her &s;al|vation in the life to come. By the marriage cove|nant they are one, and are to love one another as they love them&s;elves. "Hu&s;bands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the church and gave him|&s;elf for it. So ought men to love their wives even as their own bodies, he that loveth his wife, loveth him&s;elf." Their intere&s;ts and their cares are mu|tually one. By the merciful Creator, the woman was given to the man, as a comfort and relief from the gloom of &s;olitude, when it was found "not good for man to be alone." The wife &s;hould therefore be received and loved by her hu&s;band, as a gift from heaven; and "he who findeth a wife, a virtuous wife, obtaineth a ble&s;&s;ing from God." For&s;aking all others, the hu&s;band is bound to the wife, by the law of the marriage covenant, which is founded in the law of nature, and made a precept of the chri&s;tian religion. "For this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave his father and his mother, and &s;hall be joined to his wife, and they two &s;hall be one fle&s;h." A union of per&s;ons in this relation, &s;hould ever be attended with an union of affection, and with increa&s;ing love and kind|ne&s;s, that the marriage &s;tate may be happy and a ble&s;&s;ing to the parties. "Rejoice with the wife of thy youth, let her be as the loving hind and plea&s;ant roe,&mdash;and be thou always ravi&s;hed with her love." It is the duty of the hu&s;band to take the lead in the
<PB N="169" REF="028999_0160_0FDDD15C980AD4B8">religious exerci&s;es and government of the family. "Likewi&s;e ye hu&s;bands dwell with your wives ac|cording to knowledge, giving honour to the wife, as unto the weaker ve&s;&s;el, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder|ed."</P>
<P>THE duty of the wife is to love and reverence her hu&s;band; and promote his intere&s;t, comfort and happine&s;s. That the happine&s;s of mankind might be increa&s;ed an help meet was given to man, at the creation. Per&s;onal and perpetual love and fidelity are mutually pledged in the marriage covenant, and the wife expre&s;sly promi&s;es obedience to the hu&s;|band. "Nature, &s;ays one, may have made and left the &s;exes of the human &s;pecies, nearly equal, in their faculties and perfectly &s;o in their rights; but to guard again&s;t tho&s;e competitions, which an equali|ty, or a conte&s;ted &s;uperiority, is almo&s;t &s;ure to pro|duce, the chri&s;tian religion enjoins upon the wife that obedience which &s;he promi&s;es, and in terms &s;o peremptory and ab&s;olute, that it &s;eems to extend to every thing not criminal, or not entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with the woman's happine&s;s."</P>
<P>THE mahometan and pagan &s;y&s;tems of religion and morality, give the power of tyrants to hu&s;bands; and place the wife in a degrading &s;tate of &s;ervitude. But the chri&s;tian morality which is founded in love, places the wife in a happy condition, and makes her the companion and friend of the hu&s;band. It de|mands obedience only in all things lawful: and this mild &s;uperiority was originally &s;ignified by <HI>his</HI> priori|ty of creation, and by the woman's being taken out of him, and given to him as a companion and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant, and by his &s;uperior &s;trength of body and forti|tude of mind, &s;itting him for the arduous labors of
<PB N="170" REF="028999_0161_0FDDD15D78BE3EC0">life. The more chri&s;tianized a people are, the hap|pier is the condition of the women. "Wives be in &s;ubjection to your own hu&s;bands, that if any obey not the word, they may be won by the conver&s;ation of the wives, while they behold your cha&s;te conver|&s;ation coupled with fear, who&s;e adorning,&mdash;let it be the hidden man of the heart, even the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price. For after this manner in old time, the holy women al&s;o who tru&s;ted in God, adorned them&s;elves, being in &s;ubjection to their own hu&s;bands, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord; who&s;e daughters ye are, &s;o long as ye do well."</P>
<P>THE character of a virtuous wife is drawn by a ma&s;terly hand, in the book of proverbs. "The heart of her hu&s;band doth &s;afely tru&s;t in her;&mdash;&s;he will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. She &s;eeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hand. She is like the merchant's &s;hips, &s;he bringeth her food from afar.

She is not a|fraid of the &s;now for her hou&s;hold for they are cloth|ed in &s;carlet. Her hu&s;band is known among the elders of the land. Strength and honor are her clothing, and &s;he &s;hall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wi&s;dom, and her tongue is the law of kindne&s;s.

<P N="2">2. The mutual duties of rulers and &s;ubjects.&mdash; The duties of magi&s;trates are the e&s;tabli&s;hment of wi&s;e and &s;alutary laws, and the impartial admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice. Rulers are called God's mini&s;ters, and are appointed to rule and judge in righteou&s;ne&s;s. The magi&s;trate's commi&s;&s;ion is compr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed in the declaration of an ancient king, 2 Chronicles 19. "He &s;et judges in the land, and &s;aid unto them take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment,&mdash; wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re|&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts." The magi&s;|trate's duty is not confined wholly to legi&s;lation, and di&s;tributive ju&s;tice; it comprehends al&s;o all &s;uitable labors for the e&s;tabli&s;hments of morality and religion; for without the &s;anctions of the&s;e civil government and order are not ea&s;ily maintained. A people who are de&s;titute of the practical knowledge of God and accountablene&s;s to him, and of a future retribution, are de&s;titute of an efficient principle of moral conduct in &s;ociety. "They who fear not God, neither will they regard man." Morality founded in the principles of religion, is the be&s;t &s;ecurity of civil government. Good morals are more efficacious than good laws. The &s;upreme ruler of nations honors and pro&s;pers a people who wor&s;hip him and obey his immutable
<PB N="172" REF="028999_0163_0FDDD165B6A34E00">laws, and ea&s;ts down the thrones and governments which reject them. He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed an immu|table connection between public virtue and public happine&s;s, and between public vice and mi&s;ery. "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is the ruin of a people." Magi&s;trates are to defend the people from external enemies, and from dome&s;tic internal factions; to guard the peace and advance the pub|lic pro&s;perity. They are to be examplary in all virtue, going before others in all good works: to deliver the oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;hield the innocent, defend the helple&s;s, and re&s;train and puni&s;h the vicious and rebellious. They are appointed for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and the prai&s;e of them who do well. As civil government is a divine ordinance, magi&s;|trates are called gods in the &s;acred writing, to denote that they act as the vicegerents of the &s;upreme ruler of the world, and that they are to conform them|&s;elves to his revealed will; mindful of their account|ablene&s;s to him, for the high tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them.

<P>THE duties of &s;ubjects or people to rulers are, &s;ubjection to lawful authority, and ready obedience to all good and &s;alutary laws. It is an important precept of the chri&s;tian religion, that "every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers, for the powers that be are ordained of God. Render to all their due: tribute to whom tribute, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. Speak not evil of dignities." In the execution of the arduous duties of their office, people are to afford to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lers all willing a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and concurrence in all things nece&s;&s;ary for the good and welfare of the community; and to offer up &s;ervent prayers to God for them, that they may

"I exhort, &s;ays St. Paul, that prayers and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."

The ble&s;&s;ings pro|mi&s;ed in former ages to the obedient, were princi|pally promi&s;es of temporal ble&s;&s;ings, as health, peace, affluence and longevity: but the go&s;pel pro|mi&s;e&s;s more valuable ble&s;&s;ings; the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace; and yet in that merciful cove|nant temporal ble&s;&s;ings are al&s;o included, and given to the righteous; &s;o far as they &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for their be&s;t good, and the glory of God.

Some read the promi&s;e in the original, "That they, thy parents, may prolong thy days." Parents by their prayers and ble&s;&s;ing on obedient children, are in&s;tru|mental of drawing down ble&s;&s;ings from heaven upon them, as long life, u&s;efulne&s;s, honor and happine&s;s. Tho&s;e who now obey their parents in the Lord, if they do not always enjoy long life, yet the lo&s;s, if it may be called a lo&s;s, &s;hall be made up to them, in ble&s;&s;ings more valuable: and &s;uch per&s;one are com|monly more u&s;eful, re&s;pected and beloved while they live, and lamented when dead.

<P N="1">1. As the obligation of children to parents is placed at the head of all moral and relative duty to men, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfer the great importance of filial obe|dience; that children &s;hould love their parents, cheerfully obey all their lawful commands, and &s;eek their intere&s;t, comfort and happine&s;s in all re&s;pects. Allow me, dear children and youth, to invite and urge you to the con&s;tant ob&s;ervance of the &s;acred duties which are due to your parents. They are of the utmo&s;t importance to your honor and happine&s;s, and to the comfort of your parents. "Hearken ye children to the in&s;tructions of a father, and attend to know under&s;tanding." Experience and wi&s;dom are to be expected from your parents, and you are favored by heaven, in that you have &s;uch affection|ate and faithful guides to direct you in knowledge and virtue. Tho&s;e who&s;e names are mentioned with approbation in the &s;acred pages, were dutiful and affectionate to their parents. Jacob the &s;on of I&s;aac attended to the wi&s;hes of his pious parents, in his &s;et|tlement in the world, and comforted them; as did al&s;o his pious father. The behaviour of E&s;au was the rever&s;e, and procured him the character of a pro|fane per&s;on. Jo&s;eph was a mo&s;t dutiful &s;on, and God highly honored and pro&s;pered him. Above all, let me propo&s;e to your imitation the example of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, who in the days of his childhood and youth, was &s;ubject to his earthly parents.

ALTHO' you can never make an equal return of love and obedience to your parents, for all their care and kindne&s;s towards you, yet let it be your earne&s;t endeavour to recompen&s;e them.

Shun all occa&s;ions of grief to them; and let them have the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the good fruits of their labors and cares for you, in your good and virtuous con|ver&s;ation. For they can have no greater joy in this world, than to &s;ee you walking in the truth.</P>
<P>DISOBEDIENCE to parents is a dreadful evidence of a degenerate and wicked heart, and of a per&s;on's ripening for all manner of evil and ruin. It is cla&s;&s;ed by the apo&s;tle with unthankfulne&s;s and unmerciful|ne&s;s, and other crimes; "and they who do &s;uch things &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God." The cur&s;e of heaven will fall on &s;uch, either in this world, or the world to come. "The eye that mocketh at his father, and de&s;pi&s;eth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley &s;hall pick it out, and the young eagles &s;hall eat it:&mdash;his lamp &s;hall be put out in ob&s;cure darkne&s;s."</P>
<P>IT has been ju&s;t remarked that tho&s;e who have been loving and dutiful to parents, God has u&s;ually pro&s;pered in the world, and them&s;elves al&s;o ble&s;&s;ed, with dutiful children, and with the riches of hea|venly grace. And that tho&s;e on the other hand, who have been di&s;obedient and cruel to parents, have been puni&s;hed with children like them&s;elves.

Follow your in&s;truc|tions until you &s;ee the good fruits, in their virtuous lives. Awful will be the condemnation of tho&s;e parents who have neglected the &s;ouls of their chil|dren, or by their ill example drawn them to wicked|ne&s;s and ruin. "Their blood will be required at their hands." It will appear that altho' they were capable of being taught their obligations to God, you &s;uffered them to grow up in ignorance of him; tho' they had precious &s;ouls to be &s;aved, you &s;uffered them to be lo&s;t.

<P>BUT on the other hand, peaceful is the exit of the pious parent, who has labored to &s;ecure the &s;alvation of his children. His labor is with the Lord, and his reward in heaven. Having done his duty towards them, as a faithful parent, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace, how mu&s;t his happine&s;s in heaven be increa&s;ed, when there he &s;hall find that his labor was not in vain; when his children &s;hall be "his crown of joy, and ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed."&mdash; Impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;olemn belief of a &s;peedy entrance upon one or the other of the&s;e momentous &s;cenes, let us, parents and children, humbly look to God, imploring his efficacious grace, that we may &s;o fulfil the duties of the&s;e relations as to obtain acceptance, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>To conclude: let it, &s;irs, be our daily care and labor, to do, with all good con&s;cience, in the fear of God, the duties of the &s;everal relations which we &s;u&s;|tain towards our fellow men. And may we &s;erve our generation well, by the will and grace of God, whether we are parents, or children,&mdash;brethren or &s;i&s;ters,&mdash;magi&s;trates or &s;ubjects,&mdash;preachers or hear|ers,&mdash;ma&s;ters or &s;ervants,&mdash;rich or poor,&mdash;&s;uperiors, inferiors or equals: remembering that death will &s;peedily di&s;&s;olve the&s;e connexions, when "we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t," to give account how we have done our duty in them: that we may give it with joy, and be accepted as good and faithful &s;ervants, may it plea&s;e God of his mercy to grant, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us our Lord, who hath loved the children of men, and to whom be prai&s;es everla&s;ting.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON XIII. The duty and the means of pre&s;erving life,&mdash;the oppo&s;ite vices.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRECEPT SIXTH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS XX. 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thou &s;halt not kill.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort, but comprehen&s;ive precept, and like the other negative precepts of the law in|volves the duties oppo&s;ed to the &s;in prohibited. It forbids the taking of life, either our own, or the life of others; and comprehends the duty of per&s;uing all lawful and &s;uitable means to pre&s;erve life. It is to be under&s;tood with the re&s;triction of unlawful put|ting to death: for the law of nature ju&s;tifies taking away life in certain ca&s;es, and the precepts of chri&s;|tianity do not di&s;annul that law.</P>
<P>As this precept forbids unju&s;tly putting to death, it nece&s;&s;arily forbids tho&s;e evil pa&s;&s;ions, or actions, which have a direct or remote tendency to the per|petration of this great &s;in. And on the other hand it demands the cultivation of tho&s;e benevolent and friendly affections towards our fellow men, which are nece&s;&s;ary to make life de&s;irable and happy. It re|gulates all our thoughts, words and actions in our intercour&s;e with mankind. It is a law given by the omni&s;cient &s;earcher of hearts, who demands good|ne&s;s and rectitude of principle and thought, as well
<PB N="182" REF="028999_0173_0FDDD17FF99FF018">as propriety and benevolence of behaviour. That it is thus exten&s;ive and &s;piritual as well as external, appears from the expo&s;ition given of it by our Lord, Matthew 6. "Who&s;oever is angry with his brother, without a cau&s;e, &s;hall be in danger of the judgment." And "who&s;oever, &s;ays St. John, hateth his brother is a murderer." For it is un|re&s;trained indulgence of the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of anger, hatred and revenge which impels to the per|petration of this enormous crime. This precept then re&s;pects the due government of our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, as well as our words and actions. As it re&s;trains the ira&s;cible pa&s;&s;ions, it al&s;o condemns all wrathful expre&s;&s;ions and actions, all contentions, wounding, duelling and the like brutal behaviour. As all &s;inful di&s;po&s;itions and actions tending to de&s;|troy life, are forbidden, the practice of the oppo&s;ite virtues are commanded. I &s;hall attempt to explain and illu&s;trate this precept, by con&s;idering,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE duty of u&s;ing all &s;uitable means to pre|&s;erve life.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE unlawfulne&s;s of taking away our own, or the life of others.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE duty of &s;elf government, and of bringing under the &s;ubjection of religion, our &s;pirits, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, and the cultivation of the oppo&s;ite virtues.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are to employ all lawful means to pre&s;erve our own life, by u&s;ing with moderation and tempe|rance, the bounties of providence, in the nouri&s;h|ment and life of the body.</P>
<P>THE gifts of nature are liberally di&s;pen&s;ed for the &s;upport of life. The &s;oil, the &s;ea, the air and the
<PB N="183" REF="028999_0174_0FDDD181834BE710">elements, are all laboring to prepare food and cloath|ing and comforts for mankind. But the exertions of men are nece&s;&s;ary to bring to maturity and per|fection the means of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance: and by the &s;weat of his face, man is to get his bread. A certain proportion of food is nece&s;&s;ary for the life of the body: more than this is exce&s;s and intemper|ence. The wants of nature are few and are ea&s;ily &s;upplied: a luxurious appetite creates many artificial ones, and is not ea&s;ily gratified. Health is pre&s;erved by temperence. It is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to protect our bodies from the extremes of heat and cold and &s;torms, by &s;uitable cloathing; and in &s;ickne&s;s to u&s;e proper means and medicine, for the re&s;toration of health. The bounties of providence de&s;igned for the health and life of the body, are in numerous in|&s;tances by the abu&s;e of them, the means of de&s;troy|ing them. Di&s;ea&s;es and untimely death are com|monly among the unhappy effects of intemperence. Self-pre&s;ervation is a natural principle, and a law of revelation. "No man hateth his own fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it." Man is, by his Creator, in &s;ome degree committed to his own keep|ing, and the means of pre&s;erving life are within his reach. There are many dangers in life, in which the interference of others can afford him no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and under providence, he mu&s;t depend upon his own exertions. And in the u&s;e of the &s;upports of life he cannot make u&s;e of the aid of others.</P>
<P>THERE are however certain exempt ca&s;es in which duty to God obliges to hazard life, and even to re|&s;ign or take it away. The&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-de|&s;ence,&mdash;lawful war,&mdash;and in the cau&s;e of religion, in times of per&s;ecution. When one is attacked and life aimed at, if the per&s;on cannot e&s;cape, he may lawfully take the life of the murderer. The rea&s;on
<PB N="184" REF="028999_0175_0FDDD1830E6086D8">of this is, that the pre&s;ervation of his own life, is committed to him as the fir&s;t object of his care. The chri&s;tian religion teaches us the duty of pre&s;erving our own life, when in danger from an enemy, by all prudent and lawful means. When the enemies of Paul combined to take his life, he u&s;ed proper means to pre&s;erve it. He &s;ought that protection from authority which is the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of government to afford to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN lawful defen&s;ive war, per&s;one are obliged to hazard the lives of others, as well as their own. When men ri&s;e up violently to de&s;troy the lives and properties of others, they may be lawfully re&s;i&s;ted and de&s;troyed. If they act the part of furious bea&s;ts of prey, like bea&s;ts of prey, they are to be de&s;troyed. But this is lawful only in nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-defence, and when all other means of pre&s;ervation have failed.</P>
<P>THERE have been in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have &s;acrificed their own lives to &s;ave the life of others. "Peradventure, for a good man, one would even dare to die."</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o a duty for a per&s;on to re&s;ign his life for the cau&s;e of God, or in defence of the true religion. When a per&s;on is not permitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> live, unle&s;s he will renounce the wor&s;hip of God, or abjure the true religion, it is his duty to &s;ubmit to death. This was the fiery trial to which the ancient worthies, and the martyrs in former and later ages &s;ubmitted. They were tortured not accepting deliverence. They &s;ealed their te&s;timony to the truth with their blood, and e&s;teemed the &s;ufferings of death, of &s;mall account compared with the glory that awaited them in heaven. To &s;uch are addre&s;&s;ed the animating words of Chri&s;t. "Fear not them that kill the
<PB N="185" REF="028999_0176_0FDDD18907F29B60">body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul; but rather fear him who is able to de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell. For he who &s;aveth his life, &s;hall loo&s;e it; and he who loo&s;eth his life for my &s;ake and the go&s;|pel &s;hall find it." As the love of God is a good in|finitely preferable to life, life is to be willingly &s;acri|ficed in the competition, whenever he is plea&s;ed to permit per&s;ecution to rage.</P>
<P N="2">2. MEN may not lawfully take away their own lives by laying violent hands on them&s;elves. The precept, thou &s;halt not kill, which perhaps with greater propriety might be tran&s;lated <HI>thou &s;halt do no murder,</HI> equally prohibits the taking our own life and the life of others. No condition of &s;ufferings can ju&s;tify an impatient wi&s;hing for death, and much le&s;s the putting a period to life. Suicide and what|ever tends to ha&s;ten death, is forbidden by his pre|cept. God has appointed to us our &s;tation in this life, and we are not to di&s;mi&s;s our&s;elves, but wait the appointed time. The &s;uicide is chargable with the aggravated guilt of murder. His fear of pre&s;ent or future &s;ufferings in life, hurry him to the horrid crime, and prove him to be of a da&s;tardly &s;pirit. His deliberately ru&s;hing into eternity for refuge from trouble, argues his great impiety, and bold de|fiance of the authority and ju&s;tice of God. Shall a de&s;erter be puni&s;hed with death by the hands of men? what will then be his condition, who de&s;erts his &s;tation in this world, and appears in the awful pre&s;ence of his maker, un&s;ummoned and unpre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pared: He appears before him in the very act of in&s;ulting him, and without the po&s;&s;ibility of repen|tance. The condition of &s;uch an enormous offen|der we can neither expre&s;s or imagine. From troubles here, and which for ought he knew, might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of &s;hort duration, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ally
<PB N="186" REF="028999_0177_0FDDD18A83D97940">&s;hifting, he plunges into that world of mi&s;ery, to which rebels again&s;t God, and all murderers are doomed. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eri&s;hed king Saul, falling upon his own &s;word, on Mount Gilboa, too cow|ardly to bear a rever&s;e of fortune; and thus fell Judas, that he might go to that place for which his crimes had prepared him.</P>
<P>FROM the charge of the guilt of &s;uicide, we mu&s;t exempt that ancient &s;oldier and &s;ervant of God, Samp&s;on. His ca&s;e was peculiar. His cruel enemies and the enemies of God had him in their hands. They had put out his eyes and in&s;ulted him in his mi&s;ery. From the circum&s;tances of his death, it appears that he was divinely directed as to the manner of it; that by his voluntary death he might prevent the phili&s;|tines from inflicting one more cruel, do valiently in the overthrow of tho&s;e whom God had doomed to de&s;truction, &s;top the triumphs of the daughters of the uncircumci&s;ed, over one of the faithful &s;ervants of God, and expo&s;e the vanity of their Idol deities. God wrought a miracle, to make his death glorious and u&s;eful. He is ranked by the apo&s;tle, among the worthies who died in faith, the circum&s;tances of it, mu&s;t therefore have been by divine direction. In the &s;ame light we are al&s;o to under&s;tand the trying act of the patriarch Abraham, in obedience to the command of God, about to offer up his only &s;on in &s;acrifice. In this my&s;terious affair, the faith and obe|dience of Abraham was mo&s;t marvellous, and &s;o was al&s;o the re&s;ignation of I&s;aac. He voluntarily &s;ubmitted to be &s;lain. His age and &s;trength could have &s;uc|ce&s;sfully re&s;i&s;ted; but per&s;uaded that it was the will of God, he bowed his head, patient as a lamb, upon the alter, waiting the fatal &s;troke: and the father when he drew the knife and was on the point of plunging it into the heart of his &s;on, loved him as his own &s;oul, and gladly would have died for him.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="028999_0178_0FDDD18C16927910">
THIS marvellous action was de&s;igned to &s;hew the patriarch and the ancient church, in a lively fig|ure, the death of Chri&s;t the promi&s;ed Saviour. A|braham's &s;laying his &s;on was to expre&s;s the almighty father giving his beloved &s;on to die, to atone for the fins of men; and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of I&s;aac, the patient re&s;ignation of Je&s;us to death. <HI>Then</HI> the go&s;pel was preached to Abraham,&mdash;<HI>then</HI> he &s;aw in lively vi&s;ion "the day of Chri&s;t, and was glad." He believed in God and in the certain advent of the Me&s;&s;iah, and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. I &s;hall only add here, that the ram miraculou&s;ly caught in the thicket and offered in &s;acrifice, in the room of I&s;aac, was de&s;igned to &s;ignify God's acceptance of the &s;ac|rifices of animals until the advent of the great &s;acri|fice for &s;in, as perpetual memorials to his ancient church of that glorious event.</P>
<P>GOD is the proprietor of the lives of his creatures, and may con&s;i&s;tently with his goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, make u&s;e of one to take away the life of another; as he u&s;es natural means or &s;econd cau&s;es, to bring to a period the lives of his creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are to pre&s;erve the lives of our fellow men, by all &s;uch friendly and benevolent means, as tend to promote their health, their peace and worldly con|dition; by guarding them from injuries and wrongs, by admini&s;tring comfort to the afflicted&mdash;cloathing to the naked&mdash;food to the fami&s;hing&mdash;medicine and nouri&s;hment to the &s;ick, and help to the helple&s;s of all ages and conditions. The obligations of pre&s;er|ving the lives of others appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. IN that mankind are made for &s;ociety. "It is not good for man to be alone." If it was lawful for one man to take the life of another, for any or every
<PB N="188" REF="028999_0179_0FDDD18DC2C899C8">cau&s;e, a general and univer&s;al ma&s;&s;acre would take place; for the right of one &s;o to do, would be the the right of all, and the world would become a &s;laugh|ter hou&s;e of de&s;olation and field of blood. It is evi|dent that &s;ince mankind are placed together, by their creator, on the earth, it is his will that they &s;hould be mutually helpful and beneficial. We therefore find that we are dependent on each other for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;ociety, to our comfortable exi&s;tence here, and defence again&s;t the many accidents and evils of life: the helple&s;s infant is dependent on the parent, and the &s;ick and infirm, on tho&s;e who have ability to re|lieve them.</P>
<P>MANKIND are dependent on each other, not only for the attainment of the means of a comfortable ex|i&s;tence in life, but for that knowledge and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which are requi&s;ite to their &s;piritual and immortal happine&s;s. <HI>This</HI> is the life of the &s;oul, infinitely im|portant, and of more value than this temporary life. Ignorance and vice are the death of the &s;oul: but in the knowledge and love of God, con&s;i&s;ts its &s;pirit|ual and eternal life. The &s;alvation of the &s;oul, is worthy the name of life. This pre&s;ent exi&s;tence will &s;peedily clo&s;e; but the life of the &s;oul, will never cea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE principle which impels us to pre&s;erve the pre|&s;ent life of our&s;elf and others, &s;hould more powerful|ly impel us to &s;ecure and pre&s;erve this better life.&mdash; For what &s;hall it profit a man, if he &s;hould prolong the days of this vain life to its utmo&s;t bounds, and gain the whole world, and lo&s;e an immortal life?&mdash; This life is the one thing needful, and which the &s;ight of nature and the precepts of the go&s;pel, teach us to &s;eek fir&s;t and la&s;t, as our chief duty and felicity. They are chargeable with the guilt of murdering their
<PB N="189" REF="028999_0180_0FDDD1922936E740">own &s;ouls, who continue in ignorance of God, of the Saviour, &amp; the truths &amp; duties of revelation, while the means of knowledge and grace are at hand. They are guilty of de&s;troying the &s;ouls of others, who &s;uf|fer tho&s;e under their care to grow up in ignorance and wickedne&s;s, or hinder their &s;alvation by their per|nicious example. <HI>They</HI> pre&s;erve the life of their pre|cious &s;ouls who &s;trive to know God and their duty; who love God in &s;incerity, and believe in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and do his commandments. <HI>They</HI> pre|&s;erve the life of the &s;ouls of others, who are in&s;tru|mental of reading them in the paths of virtue and religion, to the knowledge of God and our almighty Saviour.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY who neglect to pre&s;erve the lives of oth|ers by all &s;uitable means in their power, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as acce&s;&s;ory to their death: and guilty of a &s;pecies of murder. The principle which inclines us to pre&s;erve our own life, &s;hould compel us to pre|&s;erve the life of others. For the law of nature and revelation has made it our duty to "love our neigh|bor as our&s;elves." This divine law, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord hath illu&s;trated by his own example, as the pattern of our imitation, even that mankind &s;hould love one a|nother with the &s;ame love which they have for them|&s;elves. The love which we bear to our&s;elves, which powerfully excites us to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to pre|&s;erve life,&mdash;to &s;hun things hurtful and dangerous to our own life and happine&s;s, we are to put in exerci&s;e towards our fellow men, in like circum&s;tances. And by the &s;ame principle of benevolence to others, we are al&s;o bound to &s;eek their &s;piritual edification, and e|ternal happine&s;s, by all the means and advantages which God hath put into our hands.</P>
<P>THIS great moral law of univer&s;al love to mankind,
<PB N="190" REF="028999_0181_0FDDD19384F10F78">which was wonderfully di&s;played in the life and death of Chri&s;t, is much in&s;i&s;ted on by numerous precepts and examples in the go&s;pel. Without that charity to our fellow men, which powerfully inclines us in our re&s;pective relative and &s;ocial connections, to do good and &s;eek the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of others, an in&s;pired apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that we are no|thing. "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor. Follow after charity. By love &s;erve one another: for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf." Were this principle of uncorrupted religion, in univer&s;al u&s;e, mankind would do no injury knowingly; but be di&s;po&s;ed to promote the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of others as their own. The mi&s;eries which men &s;uffer from their own follies and crimes, and which are brought upon men by their fellow men, would be no more, and &s;ecurity, quietne&s;s and peace univer&s;ally abound. But as this is not the condition of man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of de|generacy from God and duty; it is nece&s;&s;ary that laws and puni&s;hments &s;hould be the re&s;ort, to re&s;train men from crimes. While the corrupt pa&s;&s;ions of men overcome the dictates of enlightened rea&s;on, and break the laws of God and &s;ociety, ca&s;es will ari&s;e in which it is thought lawful to take away life; &s;ome in&s;tances of which have been already mentioned, on which a few additional ob&s;ervations will be made.&mdash; Such in&s;tances are, ju&s;t &s;elf-defence again&s;t a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &mdash;lawful defen&s;ive war,&mdash;and the execution of civil ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE who &s;uffers him&s;elf to be killed, when there is not a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping death, except by the death of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, is chargeable with the guilt of not pre&s;erving his own life, and in effect al&s;o, of val|uing
<PB N="191" REF="028999_0182_0FDDD195C50464B0">the life of the murderer more than his own, which he is not obliged to do. Such a &s;udden a&s;|&s;ault ju&s;tifying the &s;laying an enemy, is on the &s;up|po&s;ition, that the a&s;&s;aulted has not opportunity to e&s;cape, or appeal to the magi&s;trate, or tho&s;e means of defence which the laws have provided. On the &s;ame principle we are to defend the life of our neigh|bor or fellow men, when attacked by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE law of nature ju&s;tifies &s;laying an enemy in a ju&s;t defen&s;ive war. The law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation which ju&s;tifies an individual, in &s;laying his enemy in the defence of his own life, makes it the duty of people to de&s;troy the lives of public enemies, when their own cannot otherwi&s;e be pre&s;erved. Chri&s;tian rulers have in all ages deemed it a duty to re&s;i&s;t with armed violence, the de&s;troyers of nations. But be|fore this extremity is re&s;orted to, a people ought to be well &s;atisfied that the war is ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, and that all prudent and pacific mea&s;ures have been u&s;ed, and have failed. It is to be lamented that mankind, have &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;covered a prompti|tude for war; and too frequently plunged into the dreadful gulf, to gratify a &s;pirit of unforgiving re|venge, or mean ambition, or avarizious plunder. The precious lives of myriads of the human race have been &s;acrificed upon this all devouring altar.</P>
<Q><L>"O why will kings forget that they are men?</L>
<L>"And men that they are brethren?"</L></Q>
<P>AN in&s;pired apo&s;tle traces this evil to its &s;ource. "From whence come wars and fightings? Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts that war in your members?"</P>
<P>THAT war is ju&s;t, in certain ca&s;es, appears in that the Mo&s;t High him&s;elf, commanded the I&s;raelites to
<PB N="192" REF="028999_0183_0FDDD19B6E238600">war again&s;t the Midianites and de&s;troy them. And a cur&s;e is denounced again&s;t him, that kept back his &s;word from blood. In &s;uch ca&s;es the peaceable re|ligion of the Saviour does not forbid it. To his di&s;ciples he &s;ays, "he that hath no &s;word, let him &s;ell his garment and buy one." Chri&s;tians have a right to &s;elf-defence. His di&s;ciples carried arms to defend them&s;elves from enemies, as appears by one of them drawing his &s;word to defend Chri&s;t at the time of his &s;urrendry of him&s;elf to his per&s;ecutors. The nece&s;&s;ary duty of &s;elf-defence, is con&s;i&s;tent with his declaration, that "they who u&s;e the &s;word, &s;hall al&s;o peri&s;h by the &s;word:" which has, no doubt, re|ference to offen&s;ive wars, or wars as they are com|monly managed.</P>
<P>ITS lawfulne&s;s further appears, from the very pro|per exhortation which his harbinger, John, gave to the &s;oldiers who came to his bapti&s;m, and a&s;ked, "And what &s;hall we do?" that is, that we may be qualified &s;ubjects of the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. Had their profe&s;&s;ion been &s;inful, it was of the la&s;t importance that they &s;hould know it. John an&s;wered them, "do violence to no man,&mdash;accu&s;e no man fa&s;lely,&mdash;and be content with your wages." He cautions them again&s;t the peculiar temptations at|tending the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; but does not con|demn the profe&s;&s;ion lawfully u&s;ed. It is indeed a great oalamity that men are &s;ometimes forced to the dreadful trade of war, in &s;elf-defence; for while they re&s;i&s;t their enemies, they hazard their own life, and the innocent and oppre&s;&s;ed fall in battle, as well as their guilty oppre&s;&s;ors. Happy would it be for in|dividuals as well as nations, did that direction of the apo&s;tle &s;uitably impre&s;s all minds, "As much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men."</P>

<P>To the&s;e exceptions from the text, may be added the lawfulne&s;s of taking away the life of criminals, by the hand of public ju&s;tice. One end of the in&s;titu|tion of civil government, is to be "a terror to evil doers." It is &s;aid to be a dictate of the law of na|ture that murderers &s;hould be put to death. It was a judicial law given to I&s;rael, "Thou &s;halt not &s;uf|fer a murderer to live." Some humane advocates for the mitigation of the &s;everity of capital puni&s;h|ments, have however, doubted of the lawfulne&s;s of taking away the life of a man, even for murder. They a&s;&s;ert that as the <HI>judicial</HI> laws of the Jews were local and temporary, they are not now obligatory: and that as a man has not power over his own life, he cannot convey to &s;ociety a power to take it away. But to this it is replied, that as an individual has a lawful right, (as has been already &s;hewn) to de&s;troy his murderer; on his death, that right devolves to the &s;ociety, and they may lawfully u&s;e it, for the &s;afe|ty of the public. If a puni&s;hment could be devi&s;ed more efficacious to re&s;train from the commi&s;&s;ion of this dreadful crime; it would be the dictate of wi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> to adopt it.

THE commutation of the puni&s;hment of death, for &s;olitary confinement and con&s;tant labor, which &s;ome legi&s;latures have adopted is a dictate of mercy as well as ju&s;tice. And as it gives offenders an oppor|tunity to reflect upon their crimes and to reform; it is to be hoped will be more effectual to re&s;train bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, than even the puni&s;hment of death.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The legi&s;latures of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut have adopted this humane and wi&s;e method of puni&s;hment.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS precept forbids private or per&s;onal revenge for any real or imaginary injury. Whether a per&s;on prompted by a malicious &s;pirit of revenge wi&s;hes mi&s;chief to another, or by &s;ecret arts aims at the de&s;truction of his comfort or life, he is a murder|er, in the &s;ight of God, and falls under the condem|nation of this law. Unre&s;trained anger leads to the commi&s;&s;ion of this greate&s;t crime of man again&s;t man. And as &s;uch, it has annexed to it, the mo&s;t &s;hameful, dreadful puni&s;hment: univer&s;al horror and untimely death, from the hands of men, and the wrath of almighty God, in the world to come. So we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;hew the great and aggrevated guilt of this &s;in. So precious in the &s;ight of God is the life of man, that in the laws delivered to the jews, the ox or other bea&s;t, that had killed a man, was to be put to death, and its fle&s;h to be held in abomination. The rea&s;on given in that law, why one man may not put another to death, is, that in the image of God, made he man. There was &s;omething divine, originally in man, and his life is &s;acred. Man's
<PB N="196" REF="028999_0187_0FDDD1A64F2F5FF8">life here, is the beginning and the preparation of an exi&s;tence, which will probably be commen&s;urate in duration, with the exi&s;tence of the eternal Jehovah. He, who deprives another of life, is guilty of the greate&s;t robbery towards God,&mdash;inju&s;tice and cruel|ty towards a fellow immortal, the highe&s;t offence a|gain&s;t &s;ociety,&mdash;and the greate&s;t folly and madne&s;s towards him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE murderer is guilty of robbery towards God. All creatures are the ab&s;olute property of God. In him they live, and move, and have their being; and God only, has a right to di&s;po&s;e of their lives. He alone may kill or keep alive, and with|out his permi&s;&s;ion and direction, none may lawfully deprive another of life. He who takes the life of another, boldly attempts to take him out of the hands of God, out of who&s;e, hands, none can deliver. It is robbing God of a &s;ubject, a child, a &s;ervant whom he hath &s;ent into this world, and to whom he hath a&s;&s;igned his work and labor, during an appointed time.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is an act of the greate&s;t inju&s;tice and cruel|ty towards a fellow creature: as it deprives him of that life which his creator gave him, and which he only can rightly take away. It is an injury for which the offender can make no &s;atisfaction. It cuts off the &s;ufferer from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life and all his earthly comforts. It is an injury great beyond all calculation, as it deprives him of the time and advantages of pre|paring for death and eternal &s;cenes, and it may be preventing of his eternal &s;alvation. He is &s;uddenly deprived of an opportunity of making his peace with God. It is an irreparable injury to the friends of the decea&s;ed, as it deprives them of a brother, a fath|er, a &s;on, on whom perhaps they depended for &s;up|port.
<PB N="197" REF="028999_0188_0FDDD1A652CFEB00">It is a violation of that law of our nature which obliges us to love our fellow men and to do them good and not evil, and pur&s;ue their peace and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is an high handed offence again&s;t &s;ociety, as it deprives the community of a member; and a|gain&s;t magi&s;tracy and the laws of the community.&mdash; It is to wre&s;t the &s;word of ju&s;tice from the hand of authority, and trample upon human and divine laws.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE murderer is guilty of the greate&s;t folly and madne&s;s towards him&s;elf. He does him&s;elf, event|ually a greater injury, if po&s;&s;ible, than is done to the &s;ufferer. He de&s;troys his own peace and happine&s;s, plants the daggers of &s;elf torment within him, and feels a thou&s;and wounds, for the wound which he hath given: he &s;eeks for death as a refuge, and plunges into hell.</P>
<P>OTHER public crimes again&s;t the laws of God and &s;ociety are puni&s;hed according to their demerit: but the &s;pecial ju&s;tice, and wrath of God and man, are executed upon &s;uch great offenders. The blood of Abel cried to heaven from the ground, demanding vengeance. It has a voice which is heard to heaven, and which al&s;o makes the con&s;cience of the murder|er hear and tremble. Human ju&s;tice u&s;ually over|takes &s;uch dreadful &s;inners in this world. "As they have done to others, &s;o God hath requited them." Such is the horror of mind following the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime, that murderers have &s;ometimes &s;ought relief by a public confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;urrender of them|&s;elves into the hands of ju&s;tice. The la&s;hes of a tormenting con&s;cience have extorted a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt and a wi&s;h for death. "Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and hearken to my &s;peech: for I
<PB N="198" REF="028999_0189_0FDDD1A7ED0540D8">have &s;lain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt." And the fir&s;t murderer Cain, under the pre&s;&s;ure of terrors of con&s;cience, exclaims, "my puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear." Their thoughts are continually di&s;turbed with the recollec|tion of the unnatural deed, and the imaginary gho&s;t of the &s;ufferer, and the terrors of the almighty di&s;|tract them. Thus dreadful is the guilt of taking the life of another, and equally dreadful is the crime of taking away one's own life. The crime of &s;uicide, is loaded with the aggravations ju&s;t mentioned, and with this additional evil to the criminal, that it cuts him off from all opportunity of repentance for that great &s;in; for after death there is no room for re|pentance.</P>
<P>THE laws of God have penalties annexed to them, of puni&s;hments in this world; but as the &s;elf-mur|derer puts him&s;elf beyond the reach of puni&s;hment here, it remains to be taken cognizance of in the o|ther world. This crime therefore is not expre&s;sly mentioned, altho' it is included in the precept under con&s;ideration. And this precept is broken whether a per&s;on deprives him&s;elf, or another of life; and perhaps the fir&s;t is the greate&s;t crime, becau&s;e the mo&s;t unnatural of the two. The guilt of this &s;in de|pends on a per&s;on's being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and ex|erci&s;e of rea&s;on, and wilfully and deliberately com|mitting it. Whether it is done in the heat and in|toxication of pa&s;&s;ion, or as the effect of malice afore|thought, it is murder, in the view of the moral law; altho' it may be con&s;idered very differently, in the view of the civil law. Where a per&s;on is accidental|ly the cau&s;e of the death of another, having not an intention of injury, &s;uch a death, called chance med|ley, comes not under the condemnation of this law. When this however happened under the law of
<PB N="199" REF="028999_0190_0FDDD1A94E3DA140">Mo&s;es, the accidental man-&s;layer, was obliged to fly to the neare&s;t city of refuge, and there continue un|until the death of the High Prie&s;t; de&s;igned perhaps to teach that this &s;in, which might be committed, thro' want of due care and attention, as well as all o|thers &s;ins, were to be atoned for by the death of Je&s;us, our great High Prie&s;t, who was to come into the world. To the que&s;tion whether a murderer can be &s;aved; it may be replied, that we have ground to conclude, that but few of this de&s;cription are &s;aved. For they who&s;e hearts are &s;o hardened again&s;t their fellow men, are al&s;o hardened again&s;t God. Altho' to teach us the greatne&s;s of the divine mercy, and that we are not to limit the pow|er and grace of God, we find on facred record, that there are in&s;tances of murderers to whom the grace of repentence was given, and they obtained mercy: as David and Paul, and &s;ome of the murderers of Je&s;us. But it is al&s;o to be con&s;idered that &s;ome of the&s;e did it ignorantly, and thro' blind zeal for God; or the force of impetuous lu&s;ts and temptations. We come,</P>
<P>LASTLY, to the con&s;ideration of the great duty of &s;elf-government, and bringing our &s;pirits, our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions into &s;ubjection to the princi|ples of religion, that thro' grace we may be guarded from all advances towards the &s;ins prohibited, and cultivate the oppo&s;ite virtues.</P>
<P>WITHOUT the aid of a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace, our depraved hearts, alas, too readily cheri&s;h the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of anger and revenge, again&s;t tho&s;e who in|jure us. If the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions exi&s;t in the heart and are cheri&s;hed there, altho' they do not break out into acts of violence, yet are they a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this law in the &s;ight of God, who demands of us, love
<PB N="200" REF="028999_0191_0FDDD1FA50CABC90">and kindne&s;s towards the per&s;ons of our fellow-men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to our greate&s;t enemies. "Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy; but I &s;ay unto you love your enemies and do good to them that per&s;ecute you." By this meek and forgiving &s;pirit and di&s;po&s;ition, are we to prove our|&s;elves to be the children of God, and that we our|&s;elves have obtained thro' his abounding mercy, the forgivene&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our offences.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN the government of our pa&s;&s;ions in our in|tercour&s;e with mankind, our fir&s;t duty is to &s;uppre&s;s &s;inful anger. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in explaining this precept of the law, Matthew fifth, hath &s;olemnly de|clared that cau&s;ele&s;s anger is a violation of it. "Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not kill:&mdash;but I &s;ay unto you that who&s;oever is angry with his brother without a cau&s;e is in danger of the judgment." It al&s;o forbids all ra&s;h and unguarded expre&s;&s;ions. Anger is &s;inful when it exi&s;ts without cau&s;e; when it boils in the heart and &s;eeks revenge: when it terminates on the per&s;on of the offender, rather than on the &s;in. The Apo&s;tle directs chri&s;tians to govern the pa&s;&s;ion of anger: "be ye angry and &s;in not." This implies that all anger is not &s;in, or that there is &s;ometimes occa|&s;ion for a ju&s;t and &s;inle&s;s anger; and al&s;o the danger which we are in, of permitting ju&s;tifiable anger again&s;t the &s;ins and vices of men, to run to &s;uch an extreme as makes it criminal: "Let not the &s;un go down upon your wrath." For by indulgence it will terminate in revenge. We are carefully to watch and guard but pa&s;&s;ions, le&s;t our lawful anger and dete&s;tation again&s;t the wickedne&s;s of others &s;hould become criminal. Anger is ju&s;tifiable only when &s;in is its object; when it &s;hews a proper re&s;entment at the
<PB N="201" REF="028999_0192_0FDDD1FBB1E5C208">conduct of the wicked and profane, either again&s;t God,&mdash;the honor of religion,&mdash;and their injurous treatment of our&s;elves or others. Sinle&s;s anger in the&s;e ca&s;es is attended with pity to the per&s;on of the offender, and a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eek his be&s;t good. Je&s;us prayed for his murderers, "father forgive them." He reproved his di&s;ciples for their &s;inful anger, when on his pa&s;&s;ing with them, thro' an in|ho&s;pitable village of the Samaritans, the inhabitants offered him an affront, which the di&s;ciples greatly re&s;ented; and a&s;ked his permi&s;&s;ion for fire to fall from heaven and de&s;troy them. Je&s;us reproved them, &s;aying, "ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of."</P>
<P>UNDER the regulation of a religious principle, anger is lawful, as when the honor of God, or of religion; our own, or the reputation, intere&s;ts or lives of others, are injured by the wickedne&s;s of men. It is a religious duty in &s;uch ca&s;es, to manife&s;t a proper re&s;entment; but anger is &s;inful when it cheri&s;hes revenge. Revenge &s;eeks the de&s;truction of the offender, rather than his reformation, and is mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to a religious temper. "For if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your father in heaven forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." Unre|&s;trained anger is furious and hateful; it degrades the dignity of a man to the condition of a wild bea&s;t. See a man in the paroxi&s;m of this infernal pa&s;&s;on: his body &s;wells with inward rage &s;eeking for vent: deathlike palene&s;s or flaming redne&s;s disfigure his face; his eyes dart fire, and &s;eem to &s;tart from their &s;ockets; his teeth gna&s;h; his jaws foam; his &s;ight grows dim, and his hearing deafens; his parched throat utters hoar&s;e and broken &s;entences; his hands clench and &s;trike together with involuntary violence; his feet &s;tamp the ground; his &s;oul is a whirlwind,
<PB N="202" REF="028999_0193_0FDDD200398710E8">agitating his whole frame, and laying wa&s;te his rea|&s;on and &s;en&s;es, and &s;preading de&s;olation and death around him. Such a creature is more fit for a hou&s;e of correction, than the &s;ociety of men. "The re|flection calculated above all others, to allay that haughtine&s;s of temper, which is ever finding out provocations, and which renders anger &s;o impetuous, is that which the go&s;pel propo&s;es; namely, that we our&s;elves are, or &s;hortly &s;hall be, &s;upplicants for mercy and pardon at the judgment &s;eat of God. Imagine our &s;ecret &s;ins di&s;clo&s;ed and brought to light; imagine us thus expo&s;ed, trembling under the hand of God; ca&s;ting our&s;elves on his com|pa&s;&s;ion, crying out for mercy; imagine &s;uch a crea|ture talking of &s;atisfaction and revenge, refu&s;ing to be intreated, di&s;daining to forgive; extreme to mark and to re&s;ent what is done ami&s;s; imagine, &s;ays one this, and you can hardly feign to your&s;elf an in&s;tance of more unnatural and impious arro|gance."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bennet's letters.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE per&s;on who cultivates a peaceable and for|giving di&s;po&s;ition, will cautiou&s;ly &s;hun contentions and litigations: he will recede and give up to his adver&s;ary &s;ome things which he might lawfully claim, rather than contend; and &s;tudy for peace, rather than in&s;i&s;t on extreme right. The compen|&s;ation which a per&s;on commonly receives for the la|bor of contending much at law with his neighbors, are mortifying attendance,&mdash;lo&s;s of precious time,&mdash;the agitation of pa&s;&s;ions, hope and fear, hatred and re|venge,&mdash;his moral &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, truth and fal&s;ehood,&mdash;the lo&s;s of credit,&mdash;the hatred and contempt of good men,&mdash;the waiting of his proper|ty by every fre&s;h law &s;uit which he engages in&mdash;the
<PB N="203" REF="028999_0194_0FDDD204C3DBD2D0">entailment of beggery to his family, and probably endle&s;s ruin to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS precept enjoins the government of the ani|mal appetites; for by the intemperate indulgence of the&s;e, tho&s;e criminal pa&s;&s;ions are inflamed, which impel men to injure others and them&s;elves. It de|mands moderation and temperence in diet, and con|demns gluttony and drunkenne&s;s. Drunkenne&s;s is the &s;ource of innumerable evils. Of all the arts which men have invented to degrade them&s;elves, this is the mo&s;t effectual. Its effects, when it becomes a &s;ettled habit, are fatal. It deprives a per&s;on of his rea&s;on, the perfection and glory of man; re|duces him to a breathing carca&s;e without a &s;oul, and to a level with the brute that peri&s;heth. This &s;in di&s;qualifies a per&s;on for &s;ociety and the nece&s;&s;ary la|bors and duties of life. Some of the ancient philo&s;|ophers, &s;ometimes permitted their &s;laves to get in|toxicated, that their children, by &s;eeing the odious vice, might early learn to dete&s;t it. And what a de&s;picable figure does the drunkard make? his drow&s;y eyes &s;tupidly &s;tare,&mdash;"his tongue faulters&mdash; his lips quiver&mdash;his hands &s;hake,"&mdash;his knees bend under the weight of his wreathing body,&mdash;his &s;tomach heaves,&mdash;but decency forbids the de&s;cripti|on. But the mo&s;t melancholy con&s;ideration, is that as the rational faculties are &s;tupified by a habit of intemperance, the per&s;on cannot be made to &s;ee the evil and ruinous nature and effects of this vice. It is the &s;ource of contention and wounds without cau&s;e, and untimely death. The per&s;on who by in|toxication deprives him&s;elf of rea&s;on, is ju&s;tly puni&s;h|ed for the crimes committed in that condition; be|cau&s;e he had the power of refraining from intoxicat|ing drink. All other fle&s;hly lu&s;ts which de&s;troy the peace, health and life of our&s;elves and others, are
<PB N="204" REF="028999_0195_0FDDD206901003C8">forbidden by this precept; which al&s;o makes it our duty to cultivate and practi&s;e the oppo&s;ite virtues; as benevolence, meekne&s;s, mercy and forgivene&s;s to|wards others, and temperence and &s;obriety towards our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE government of the tongue is an important, moral, and religious duty. It is a little member; but capable of doing much good or harm. It is the outlet of the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;hould ever be under the controul of di&s;cretion. "Speak evil of no man," is a general rule of government for the tongue. All &s;lander and evil &s;peaking are &s;everely prohibited by the moral and divine law. This vice is repeatedly reprobated in the new te&s;tament, and the practi&s;e of a kind and benevolent &s;peech and behaviour forci|bly recommended. The moral &s;ocial and relative duties of life, this precept obliges us to practi&s;e from the threefold con&s;ideration of duty to God, to man|kind, and our&s;elves. "Be patient towards all men; &s;ee that none render evil for evil to any man. Avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay &s;aith the Lord. If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink; for in &s;o doing thou &s;halt heap coals of fire upon his head." The&s;e are coals which will not burn him, but melt him down into kindne&s;s, if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;pirit of a man.</P>
<P>THUS have we con&s;idered the nature and guilt of the &s;ins prohibited by this precept, and our obliga|tions to pre&s;erve the life, the health and happine&s;s of our&s;elves and our fellow-men. Before I conclude, I would remark that the precept, "thou &s;halt not kill," is a general precept, and to be under&s;tood of our fellow-men; yet al&s;o, does it include the prohi|bition
<PB N="205" REF="028999_0196_0FDDD207B8E5C7D8">of killing wantonly and for &s;port, any innocent animal.

Let not the flattering charms of wealth or plea&s;ure hinder our profiting, in the be&s;t manner, by the word and the in&s;trumental means of grace.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS conci&s;e law re&s;pects the virtue and duty of cha&s;tity. By our Saviour's expo&s;ition of it, we are taught that it is a very exten&s;ive law, and given to regulate the emotions and pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, as well as the external behaviour.</P>
<P>THE gro&s;s &s;in of adultery only is mentioned; but the precept infolds all collateral and &s;ubordinate &s;ins of the &s;ame &s;pecies, as fornication, polygamy, un|cleanne&s;s, la&s;civious thoughts and emotions of the heart, ob&s;cene &s;peech and indecent dalliance and fa|miliarity; and all tho&s;e things which are contrary to that purity of mind, and body, mode&s;t &s;peech and innocent behaviour which is the ornament and glory of both &s;exes. This &s;ubject is important as it is delicate; it &s;hall be my endeavour to treat it with a becoming mode&s;t plainne&s;s. And may a di&s;covery of the guilt and danger of the &s;in prohibited in all its branches, excite an abhorrence of it; and the profits and plea&s;ures of the virtue of cha&s;tity of tho't, &s;peech and behaviour, invite to the love and practice of the amiable virtues implicated in this prohibition.

</LIST>
<P>THE obligations of mankind to the virtue of cha&s;|tity, is inforced by a &s;olemn prohibition of the oppo|&s;ite vice. This as well as other moral duties are delivered in negative precepts, forbidding &s;ins, be|cau&s;e of the proclivity of our depraved nature to leap the bounds of duty, rather than to practi&s;e it. Hence our obligations to practi&s;e the po&s;itive du|ties are more forcibly taught and felt, than they would be, by po&s;itive precepts. They are included in the prohibition of evil doing. The &s;in here con|demned is the &s;ource of manifold evils to the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or and to &s;ociety. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in his di|vine expo&s;ition of the decalogue,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matthew</HI> vi.</NOTE> has taught us that this law extends to the thoughts and de&s;ires of the heart, as well as to external behaviour: and as it de|mands purity of thought, it de&s;troys the evil at its &s;ource. "Ye have heard that it was &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not commit adultery. But I &s;ay unto you that who&s;oever looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." In the con&s;ideration of the &s;ins for|bidden by this law, let us pa&s;s by tho&s;e enormous vi|olations of it which brought down the wrath of hea|ven upon the ancient people of the plains, &s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire. The &s;ame bea&s;tly lu&s;ts were al&s;o practi&s;ed by the more poli&s;hed pagans of Greece and Rome; when men and women leaving

<P N="1">1. ADULTERY is forbidden. In the &s;acred &s;crip|tures the terms adultery and fornication are &s;ome|times u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly, in other places a di&s;tinct|ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erved. Adultery is the criminal commerce of the &s;exes, where one or both, are in the marriage &s;tate. This &s;in is a violation of the vow of fidelity and a di&s;&s;olution of the marriage covenant. It is an irreparable damage to the injured party, and attended with exten&s;ive evils to &s;ociety. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;troys e&s;teem and confidence between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;band and wife, and poi&s;ons the &s;ources of dome&s;tic happine&s;s. It fa&s;tens the guilt of perjury on the con&s;cience of the offend|er, and has generally been held in abhorence, even by uncivilized nations. The judicial law of the the|ocracy made the puni&s;hment of this crime capital.&mdash; Both the adulterer and adultere&s;s were to be put to death.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Leviticus</HI> xx.</NOTE> The jews with an in&s;idious de&s;ign brought one convicted of this crime to Je&s;us,
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> viii.</NOTE> &s;aying, "ma&s;|ter, Mo&s;es in the law commanded that &s;uch &s;hould be &s;toned; but what &s;aye&s;t thou?" It may be a&s;k|ed why Je&s;us did not al&s;o condemn her, and approve of her execution? To this it is replied, that the ac|cu&s;ers were the enemies of Chri&s;t, and came with the en&s;naring de&s;ign of engaging him in a contro|ver&s;y with the civil authority, to whom it belonged to take cognizance of the crime. Chri&s;t a&s;&s;umed not the office of a civil magi&s;trate or judge, and there|fore &s;aid to the woman, "neither do I condemn thee;" but adds "go and &s;in no more:" by which, although he neither acquitted or condemned her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> judge in &s;uch matters, yet reminds her of her great &s;in, and the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance and reformation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="212" REF="028999_0202_0FDDD21803C8B060">
2. THIS precept forbids the &s;in of polygamy. As divine providence, hath made the &s;exes nearly equal in number, hence the law of nature, teaches the du|ty and propriety of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> one woman only uniting in the marriage relation. This duty is plain|ly taught by that divine providence, which, at the creation made but one woman for Adam, and united them as one in the marriage covenant. Since the &s;exes are equal, to multipl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wives would be an in|jury to tho&s;e who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be deprived of any,&mdash;degrade the female character, and introduce di&s;cord and divi&s;ions in fami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es.</P>
<P>I am aware that the examples of &s;ome of the pa|triarchs, both before and after the delivery of the law, has been alledged in ju&s;tification of polygamy; Abraham and Jacob, David, Solomon and others, had each a plurality of wives. They were eminent men and favorite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of heaven. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> practice was a violation of the law of nature, why was it permitted, and why not expre&s;sly di&s;allowed? To this it may be replied, that altho' there was no expre&s;s revela|tion in early times relative to this matter, yet that it was wrong, as before ob&s;erved, might have been infered from the creation of the original pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and the equal number of the &s;exes, in all ages; and God might &s;uffer this evil, as he &s;uffered the jews to put away their wives for various inferior cau&s;es, be|cau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of men's hearts, and their incapacity, in tho&s;e ages of infancy in knowledge, to receive a more pure law. When our Saviour condemned the cu&s;tom of the jews in putting away their wives for every cau&s;e, and marrying others, he refers them, for correction of this &s;in, to the original in&s;titution of marriage, &s;aying, "it was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;o from the beginning." Had the in&s;titution of po|lygamy been lawful, it would &s;eem never more
<PB N="213" REF="028999_0203_0FDDD219D26945A8">needed than at the creation, when a world was to be populated: but God then created but one woman for one man. "For this cau&s;e, &s;hall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife." Our duty, in many things, is to be deduced by inference from the ordering of providence, and the conduct of the Deity towards men; although nothing is ex|pre&s;sly revealed.</P>
<P>THE moral evil of this practice was al&s;o to be learned from its unhappy tendency to excite the en|vious and malevolent pa&s;&s;ions and cla&s;hing inter|e&s;ts of various wives and children of one hu&s;band. And they who indulged them&s;elves in this liberty, u&s;ually &s;marted for their libidinous plea&s;ures, in the di&s;cord of their compound families. This we find in the contentions of Sarah and Hagar, I&s;aac and I&s;hmael in the family of Abraham: and the breth|ren of Jo&s;eph, in the family of Jacob. Similar unhappy effects &s;prung from the &s;ame cau&s;e, in the families of David and Solomon. The faults of pious men are recorded in the bible, not for our imitation; but warning. Polygamy was a &s;in which was then winked at; but now would be criminal; becau&s;e, by divine revelation, it is forbidden.</P>
<P N="3">3. INCEST is a &s;in condemned by this law. This trime can be committed only by tho&s;e who are of near affinity or con&s;anguinity; as between parents and children, brothers and &s;i&s;ters. The laws of Mo&s;es particularly prohibit marriage between near blood relatives. One de&s;ign of this law was to guard the cha&s;tity of the members of a family, who being accu&s;tomed to habits of intimacy, might be induced to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of cha&s;tity, did not the divine authority interpo&s;e, and forbid the mar|riage connection. Another rea&s;on of this law may
<PB N="214" REF="028999_0204_0FDDD220B40E5AE0">be to extend and enlarge the benevolence of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> kind by the union of different and di&s;tant families in the marriage relation.</P>
<P>LEGISLATURES of nations have e&s;tabli&s;hed differ|ent laws regulating this important contract. Expo|&s;itors of the judicial law of Mo&s;es, have al&s;o differ|ently under&s;tood the law, relative to the marriage of brother and &s;i&s;ter-in-law; Leviticus eighteenth: "Neither &s;halt thou take a wife to her &s;i&s;ter, to vex her, to uncover her nakedne&s;s, be&s;ides the other in her life time." A degree of ob&s;curity covers this pa&s;&s;age, which has puzzled expo&s;itors. Some &s;up|po&s;e the woman taken is the natural &s;i&s;ter of the wife, and that the hu&s;band is forbidden to marry her, while his wife, her &s;i&s;ter, is &s;till living; and that the law does not forbid him to marry her after the decea&s;e of his wife. Some under&s;tand by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a near or di&s;tant relative, agreeably to the latitude in which the terms &s;i&s;ter and brother are &s;ometimes u&s;ed, and that the precept condemns polygamy, e&s;pecially when a man re&s;orts to it with the malicious de&s;ign to vex and puni&s;h the wife: a different rea|ding of the original is given, "Thou &s;halt not take one wife to another, to vex her." But on the other hand, it is ob&s;erved, that the law condemns mar|riages between relatives le&s;s nearly allied; as between a man and his brother's widow, ver&s;e &s;ixteenth. Altho' we find this law was in one ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;ed with. To marry a half &s;i&s;ter, is al&s;o prohibited.&mdash; Perhaps we &s;hall not be in an error, if we under|&s;tand &s;ome of the precepts of the levitical law relating to the marriage of corelatives, as political rather than moral precepts, and as calculated with peculiar reference to the oeconomy of that di&s;pen&s;ation, until the coming of Chri&s;t. But whether the precept relating to the marriage of the wife's &s;i&s;ter, or the
<PB N="215" REF="028999_0205_0FDDD222F4F80B18">hu&s;band's brother, is of this kind, I will not under|take to determine. The law of nature teaches us that marriages of &s;uch near con&s;anguinity as tend to introduce confu&s;ion in families and &s;ociety, are un|lawful. The glory of God and the happine&s;s of mankind are the great end of the in&s;titution of mar|riage.</P>
<P N="4">4. FORNICATION is a violation of this precept of the law. It is a &s;in committed by two unmarried per|&s;ons of the oppo&s;ite &s;exes. The evils con&s;equent on fornication, are great to &s;ociety, and to the parties.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to &s;ociety. The well being and happine&s;s of &s;ociety depends on the well ordering and education of families. But the promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e of the &s;exes, as it is a di&s;couragement to marria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, defeats the good in&s;titution of family order. A great in|centive to honorable marriage is allayed by a lawle&s;s intercour&s;e, and the community is deprived of tho&s;e advantages which it derives from the lawful marriage of its members and the orderly education of fami|lies. Its evil effects are exten&s;ive and pernicious; as it de&s;troys the moral principle, and throws down the barriers again&s;t other vices. The criminal in|tercour&s;e of the &s;exes, is the beginning of an irregu|lar and abandoned life; for it incapaciates the mind to di&s;cern (in many important ca&s;es) the difference between right and wrong, and good and evil in moral conduct. By habitude in this vice, the mind becomes fle&s;hly, and &s;otti&s;h to the things which are "lovely, ju&s;t, hone&s;t and of good report." He who ca&s;ts off a regard to his own cha&s;tity, and the cha&s;tity of the female, on the pre&s;ervation of which depends her reputation, peace and comfort in the world, contemns the law of nature and order of &s;ocie|ty; and is de&s;titute of the reverence and fear of
<PB N="216" REF="028999_0206_0FDDD22439B23BB0">God. Let the libertine reflect a mornent on the con&s;equences; &s;hould this vicious in egularity be|come common and univer&s;al. What a di&s;ordered world of &s;en&s;uality, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery, would it produce? The enkindled wrath of heaven did once interpo&s;e to purge the earth from this dreadful pol|lution. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, perhaps, deceives him|&s;elf with the imagination, that his example can do but little harm; but it is a fal&s;e and vain imagina|tion; &s;ince it is a vice ruinous to individuals, de|&s;tructive of the order and peace of families, and injurous to &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="2">2. ITS evils are great to the parties. To be &s;e|duced from the paths of cha&s;tity is, e&s;pecially to the female, an irreparable injury. Cha&s;tity is the ornament and dignity of the female character. The lo&s;s of it, is the lo&s;s of reputation and peace. It de|prives them of the pro&s;pect of an advantageous and bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crable marriage, which they once had rea|&s;on to expect. It lowers them in their own, and the e&s;teem of their virtuous acquaintance. And altho' they may obtain on repentance, forgivene&s;s with God, yet a cen&s;orious world will not forgive. The wound rankles in their own brea&s;t, and the rec|ollection is painful. It is a grief and di&s;honor to the family and friends of the unfortunate female, but e&s;pecially to the virtuous parent. The heart bleeds at the lo&s;s of the virtue of a beloved child. It is an injury which wealth cannot repair. Great is the im|portance and dignity of female cha&s;tity, to their honor and u&s;efulne&s;s in life and peace indeath. Let the fair daughters &s;acredly guard this amiable and dignified virtue, by avoiding a needle&s;s di&s;play of real or fictiti|ous charms invi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing loo&s;e de&s;ires, and may they culti|vate a meekne&s;s of &s;pirit and mode&s;ty of deport|ment, which can never fail to recommend them to the de&s;erving, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e and the good.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="028999_0207_0FDDD225E253F6C0">
THE &s;in of the guilty &s;educer, who de&s;troys the innocency and cha&s;tity of the virtuous female, is great. The malignity and hurtful con&s;equences of this &s;in reach to limits beyond calculation; invol|ving the ruin of a virtuous female, depriving the community of a valuable head of a family, and giv|ing a la&s;ting wound to friends. And &s;hould the fe|male under the pre&s;&s;ure of this misfortune, take to abandoned cour&s;es, and peri&s;h eternally, the guilt of her ruin will fall upon the head of the criminal &s;e|ducer. Capital puni&s;hments have been inflicted on crimes le&s;s enormous, than the crime of &s;eduction.&mdash; The number of bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of this cla&s;s, would probably be &s;mall, were they, when known, &s;hunned and di&s;countenanced by the virtuous fair, with that neglect and contempt which crimes again&s;t female cha&s;tity ju&s;tly merit.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE violations of this command are ruinous to the bodies and &s;ouls of men. Some have fallen vic|tims to this &s;in in the mid&s;t of life. "Many &s;trong men have been ca&s;t down by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">" And many females who might have lived virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, u&s;eful and honora|ble in the world, have been outca&s;ts of &s;ociety and peri&s;hed in want and infamy.</P>
<P>THIS crime was awfully common among the an|cient nations of Canaan; for which &s;in, as expre&s;&s;ed by the prophet, the land vomitted out its inhabitants. It was al&s;o the prevailing &s;in of the heathen nations who once inhabited the favored regions where we now dwell, and on account of which the be&s;om of de&s;truction hath &s;wept them away.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle mentions this &s;in as committed a|gain&s;t the body. "Flee fornication. Every &s;in that a man doth is without the body." Other &s;ins again&s;t
<PB N="218" REF="028999_0208_0FDDD227697F9C88">men are external; they reach and terminate upon others; "but he that commiteth fornication, &s;inneth again&s;t his own body." It is a crime committed again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has redeemed our bodies as well as our &s;ouls, &s;hould be to us a mo&s;t per&s;wa&s;ive motive to u&s;e them as holy temples for the re&s;idence of his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit; and the members thereof as in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s, of cha&s;tity and every virtue.</P>
<P>THIS vice is ruinous to the &s;ouls of men. "The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; and to be carnally minded is death." There is no &s;in equal to this to detach the heart from God, and harden it again&s;t the duties of religion. It is in&s;en&s;ible to conviction of the truth, and dead to the duties of piety. "She that liveth in plea&s;ure, is dead while &s;he liveth." "Who&s;o commiteth adultery, lack|eth under&s;tanding: he that doth it de&s;troys his own &s;oul. A wound and di&s;honor &s;hall he get: and his reproach &s;hall not be wiped away. The hou&s;e of this &s;in, is the way to hell, and goeth down to the chambers of death."</P>
<P>IT is a &s;in, perhaps beyond any other &s;in, effica|cious to prevent the good effects of the means of grace, in the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men. In vain do the terrors of God's broken law, &s;ound the dreadful peal of vengeance on the &s;en&s;ual mind. In vain do the mercies of a bleeding Saviour call &s;uch &s;inners to repentance and &s;alvation; for this unclean &s;in indulged, takes away the heart from God, and from an awakened &s;en&s;ibility to future and eternal &s;cenes. From every defiling &s;in, may the mercy of God pre&s;erve us pure and blamele&s;s, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;poken of the nature and con&s;equen|ces of the complicated &s;in, prohibited by this precept, we come</P>
<P N="2">2. To the con&s;ideration of the duty and nece&s;&s;i|ty of watchfulne&s;s again&s;t all enticements and tempt|ations thereto. While in the body, per&s;ons are to expect that the virtue of cha&s;tity will be attacked, either by the emotions of &s;in within, or temptations from without. God has made it our duty, and our own peace and purity of mind require, that, with per&s;evering con&s;tancy, we re&s;i&s;t all temptations to every degree of the &s;in forbidden, and love and prac|tice the oppo&s;ite virtues; and gracious encourage|ment is given, that per&s;everence, in the virtuous conflict, &s;hall be crowned with un&s;peakable profit and plea&s;ure. To this trial of virtue, the young in life are e&s;pecially called. May the minds of blooming youth be fortified with the principles of virtue and religion; with the love and fear of God, and reverence of the divine authority. This princi|ple happily e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heart, will be the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t this and every known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ior of the divine law, and the animating
<PB N="220" REF="028999_0210_0FDDD2310C9DC450">motive to univer&s;al duty. Temptations to this &s;in ari&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM the evil propen&s;ities of the heart. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fountain of all evil. "From within, out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulte|ries, fornication."&mdash;The depraved, unre&s;trained heart, cheri&s;hes this and other defiling lu&s;ts. Chri&s;|tians are directed to mortify their affections that are upon the earth, and which, reign in our earthly &s;en&s;ual nature, and all the propen&s;ities thereto. E|very virtuous mind is enli&s;ted in this warfare, com|bating every fle&s;hly lu&s;t that wars again&s;t its inward purity and peace. In the conflict with the&s;e bo&s;om enemies he will not de&s;i&s;t until victory is obtained, and death relea&s;e him from the field. He who &s;trives with per&s;evering watchfulne&s;s, again&s;t the unholy de&s;ires of the fle&s;h and the mind, will be happily &s;ecure from the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. He keeps under the body, beating down, with the arms of faith and prayer, every fle&s;hly lu&s;t, and bringing all its power under &s;ubjection to the purity of the re|ligion of Je&s;us: he will triumph at the conclu&s;ion, &s;aying, thanks be to God who giveth us the victo|ry, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. TO guard again&s;t the advances of this &s;in, is to avoid all tho&s;e things which affect the &s;en&s;es or imagination with impure images, and throw their lu&s;cious and poi&s;onous effects upon the unguarded pa&s;&s;ions. Of this kind are all wanton &s;ongs, immo|de&s;t pictures, and books of ob&s;cenity. They offend again&s;t the laws of decency; and the young unguar|ded heart is in danger of receiving the impre&s;&s;ion of loo&s;e and vicious thought. Novels, plays and the|atrical exhibitions, which adorn vice in the &s;tolen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttire of vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, are hurtful to morals. They give
<PB N="221" REF="028999_0211_0FDDD232AA277160">the inexperienced fal&s;e notions of real life, and of virtue and vice; and lead to ruin.</P>
<P N="3">3. WANTON dalliance, and indecent familiarity of the &s;exes,&mdash;"chambering and wontonne&s;s," are clo&s;&s;ed by the Apo&s;tle, with the gro&s;s &s;ins of drunk|enne&s;s, envyings and &s;trife, and are to be equally avoided, by every one who would pre&s;erve purity and peace of mind.</P>
<P>THE commonne&s;s of the &s;in of fornication, is perhaps pleaded by &s;ome as an extenuation of its guilt. But the commonne&s;s of a &s;in increa&s;es its guilt, and more &s;peedily brings down the aggravated doom. "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there are who go in thereat." Tho' &s;inners join hand in hand, to keep each other in countenance, in guilt; yet will the judgements of the almighty find them out.&mdash; Tho' the cla&s;s of bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is numerous; yet the place of puni&s;hment is broad and large. A&s;|&s;ociates in guilt will afford to each other no &s;oothing comfort, when the terrors of the almighty &s;hall wound their &s;pirits; or his wrath overwhelm them, in the world to come. The commonne&s;s of the &s;in of un|cleanne&s;s, did not ward off the &s;torms of fiery ven|geance, from the cities of the plains; and compan|ions in guilt will be mutual tormentors in hell.&mdash; There the rich man, in vain, petitioned that his brethren might not come to that place of torment. He dreaded the &s;ociety of the once jovial companions of his &s;ins.</P>
<P>THE tempter of &s;ouls &s;ugge&s;ts that fornication is a &s;ecret &s;in and will not be known. Con&s;cious of guilt, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or &s;eeks to hide this &s;in from the eyes of the world; but per&s;i&s;ting in it, glories in his &s;hame, with unblu&s;hing impudence. But tho' con|cealed
<PB N="222" REF="028999_0212_0FDDD234129A9A90">from men; it cannot be concealed from the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;cient eye of God: to whom the night &s;hineth as the day. Tho' "the eye of the adulterer wait|eth for the twilight, &s;aying no eye &s;hall &s;ee me;" yet cannot the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s hide him from that all &s;eeing eye, which will bring all his works into judgment. This &s;in is a bold defiance of a pre|&s;ent God, who &s;ays to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, "even I know, and am witne&s;s, &s;aith the Lord." A dread|ful witne&s;s, in that day when the unclean tran&s;gre&s;|&s;or's &s;ins &s;hall be brought to light, in the view of ange&s;s and men; "when he &s;hall walk naked, and they &s;ee his &s;hame."</P>
<P>THE abandoned woman is repre&s;ented by Solo|mon, as u&s;ing with &s;hamele&s;s hypocri&s;y, the ma&s;k of religion to draw, to her fatal &s;nares, the un&s;u&s;|picious youth. "I de&s;cerned among the youths, a young man, void of under&s;tanding, pa&s;&s;ing thro' the &s;treets, he went the way to her hou&s;e; in the twilight in the evening of the dark night; and be|hold there met him a woman in the attire of an har|lot, and &s;ubtle of heart. So &s;he caught him and ki&s;&s;ed him, and with an impudent face, &s;aid unto him, I have peace-offerings with me, this day have I paid my vows.&mdash;Come, let us &s;olace our&s;elves with love. He goeth after her as an ox goeth to the &s;laughter, and a fool to the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ection of the &s;tocks: till a dart &s;trike thro' his liver, as a bird ha&s;teth to the &s;nare, and knoweth not that it is for his life."

<P>ANOTHER temptation attending this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that it may be repented of, before death. This a pre|&s;umtuous plea; becau&s;e the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not that God will give him a &s;pace for repentance; it is
<PB N="223" REF="028999_0213_0FDDD2359C82FEF8">a deceitful plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> becau&s;e it is the nature of this &s;in to harden the heart. The mind becomes &s;en&s;ual, and is in danger of toral reprobation; and to reform and live virtuou&s;ly, it has no under&s;tanding. They mourn at the laft, becau&s;e they have hated in&s;truc|tion and ca&s;t off the fear of God. Thus God in righteous judgment hath ca&s;t off &s;inners of this cla&s;s, "even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a repro|bate mind."</P>
<P>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who overcometh the allurements of the fle&s;hly mind, and walks in the &s;pirit, in a pure and unblamable life, is the promi&s;e of the favorable pro|tection and ble&s;&s;ing of God, in this life, and eternal honors in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> world to come: "but the fearful and unbelieveing, and the abominable, and whoremon|gers &s;hall have their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtion in the lake that burneth with fire and brim&s;tone."</P>
<P>THUS the &s;in which this precept condemns, is the &s;ource of complicated and numerous evils; and ought to be &s;huned as a mo&s;t ruinous vice, by all who would prize the favor of almighty God the pu|rity and peace of their own minds, and their eternal happine&s;s. We have &s;een that it is de&s;tructive of the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, that it opens the door to almo&s;t every other tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and is u&s;ual|ly followed with a profane and abandoned life. It is a &s;in which defiles and hardens the con&s;cience, and dooms the impenitent to the incen&s;ed vengeance of almighty God.</P>
<P>As a remedy again&s;t the &s;ins of fornication, and every degree of violation of this divine precept, God has been plea&s;ed to ordain marriage: "marriage is honorable in all, and the bed unde&s;iled." It is al&s;o a divine command.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="028999_0214_0FDDD23C4BFB3320">
THE advantages and comforts of the connubial connections are great and the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven at|tends the in&s;titution; e&s;pecially on tho&s;e "who marry in the Lord," or enter into that &s;tate, with a lively &s;en&s;e of their dependence on God, and accoun|tablene&s;s to him. By this in&s;titution the increa&s;e and happine&s;s of mankind, the order of &s;ociety, the virtuous education of families, the &s;tability of gov|ernment, and encouragements to indu&s;try and every &s;ocial virtue, are promoted. But the mo&s;t impor|tant end of this &s;acred in&s;titution is that the hu&s;band and the wife may mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in honor|ing God on earth, and preparing for that ble&s;&s;ed and holy &s;ociety in heaven, "where they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are equal unto the angels, being the children of God." I am,</P>
<P>LASTLY, to &s;peak of the advantages and plea&s;ures attendant on the virtue of cha&s;tity. The profits and plea&s;ures of a life of cha&s;tity are oppo&s;ed to the lo&s;s and mi&s;eries of a life of lewdne&s;s. Cha&s;tity is the mo&s;t ornamental and amiable virtue of the fair. Purity of mind and mode&s;ty of behaviour, which adorn the &s;emale character, an in&s;pired apo&s;tle earn|e&s;tly recommends: e&s;pecially to women who profe&s;s the pure religion of Je&s;us: "That women al&s;o adorn them&s;elves in mode&s;t apparel with &s;hameface|ne&s;s and &s;obriety." By this virtue, that honorable and un&s;potted reputation is acquired, which, e&s;pecially to the &s;emale, is more valuable than riches, and fairer than rubies. To men of virtue and worth, it is a recommendation preferable to honor|able pedigree or wealth. It has elevated women from cottages to thrones, and to the love and veneration of all. The vicious, them&s;elves, rever|ence female cha&s;tity, and are aba&s;hed in its pre&s;ence. To pre&s;erve this trea&s;ure, every occa&s;ion and incite|ment
<PB N="225" REF="028999_0215_0FDDD23C50F66458">to impure de&s;ires; all a&s;&s;ociation and familiarity with vicious characters, are to be &s;huned; and the pure&s;t principles for regulating the thoughts and be|haviour, imbibed and cultivated.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on who is fearful of offending, and de&s;irous to plea&s;e his maker, and pre&s;erve the peace and dignity of his own mind, will not only totally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tain from the gro&s;&s;er crimes of adultery and fornication; but from every degree of uncleanne&s;s, either with him&s;elf or others; and maintain his body in &s;anctification and honor. And in the conjugal &s;tate, will u&s;e its lawful enjoyments with that moderation and temperance, for which it was in&s;ti|tuted; and not as an incentive, but a remedy to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s. "It re&s;trains &s;ays one, not only from gro&s;&s;er acts; but &s;ets a guard upon the eyes, the hands, the tongue and the imagination." It is a virtue which keeps the pa&s;&s;ions and faculties of the body in due &s;ubjection to rea&s;on and religion, and pre&s;erves purity and peace in the inner man. The thoughts are rai&s;ed above low and inferior plea&s;ures, and the &s;oul enobled by the contemplation of the pure&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t objects, and by daily prayer and communion with the father of &s;pirits. I &s;hall con|clude with &s;ome inferences from this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE learn the importance and amiablene&s;s of the virtue of cha&s;tity; and the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;er|ving and cheri&s;hing purity of thought, &s;peech and behaviour, at all times and on all occa&s;ions. And that to guard again&s;t the violation of this pure virtue, the avenues of the heart mu&s;t be &s;hut and barred again&s;t every impure de&s;ire. "Keep thy heart," is the di|rection given us, "keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of life." Say to every in|truding lu&s;tful thought, "be gone; thou art an of|fence
<PB N="226" REF="028999_0216_0FDDD23DC09D2E48">to me. I cannot allow thee room in my heart and be innocent. Thou come&s;t as a deceitful gue&s;t to betray and ruin me." The mind thus re&s;olute in virtue, humbly depending on the aids of grace, will maintain its integrity, and rejoice in victory, o|ver its mo&s;t &s;ubtle and dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>WHEN expo&s;ed by the enticements of the vicious, the temptations of the world, or the propen&s;ities of a depraved nature; it behoves per&s;ons to be partic|ularly watchful over them&s;elves, and re&s;i&s;t the begin|nings of this &s;in. They &s;hould renew as in the pre|&s;ence of God, their virtuous re&s;olutions, and &s;eek for aid from heaven; as did that pious man Job; &s;ay|ing "I have made a covenant with mine eyes, why then &s;hould I look upon a maid."</P>
<P N="2">2. To guard again&s;t all degrees of this &s;in, per|&s;ons &s;hould &s;hun idlene&s;s. Idlene&s;s is the foe of cha&s;|tity, and every virtue. Diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s, as it finds employment for time and the thoughts, is a preventative of this &s;in. By idlene&s;s, fell the king of I&s;rael into this &s;in; and by the &s;ame fault fell al|&s;o the fair Dinah, the daughter of I&s;rael.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xxxiv.</NOTE></P>
<P>AVOID intemperance in meats and drinks. It fans and kindles unholy de&s;ires. U&s;e the enjoyments of life with moderation and gratitude. "Wo to them that tarry long at the wine, and go to &s;eek mixed drinks, for thine eyes &s;hall look upon &s;trange women, and thine heart &s;hall &s;peak lewd things."</P>
<P>IDLENESS and intemperance are vices nearly allied, they lead to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s; they brought ruin up|on Sodom. "Behold this was the iniquity of thy &s;i&s;ter Sodom, pride, fulne&s;s of bread and abundance
<PB N="227" REF="028999_0217_0FDDD2449A2ACE88">of idlene&s;s was in her, and in her daughters."&mdash; The&s;e were al&s;o the crimes of the old world. They were drowned in intemperance and lu&s;t, and were de&s;troyed with a flood of waters.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS &s;ubject, in the exten&s;ive view which we have taken of it, is intere&s;ting to per&s;ons of all cha|racters and ages, but to none more than tho&s;e who are in blooming days of youth, who&s;e imaginations are ardent in the expectations of the plea&s;ures of life. To you, younger brethren and friends, allow me to addre&s;s a few words of benevolent advice, the dictate of a &s;incere de&s;ire for your temporal welfare and eter|nal happine&s;s. To pre&s;erve your virtue undefiled, and &s;ecure you from every defiling &s;in, let me direct your thoughts to God, your con&s;tant dependence, and obligations to him. Be much in prayer to the God and guide of your youthful days, that his effi|cacious grace and all animating goodne&s;s, may guard you e&s;pecially from the &s;in, in all its branches which this holy law di&s;allows, and enable you to pre|&s;erve a virgin cha&s;tity in all your thoughts and in all your behaviour. By living near to God in youth, you will pre&s;erve a pure mind in a pure body, and keep your garments un&s;potted from the world and the fle&s;h. You will happily know the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of "the pure and undefiled, who walk in the law of the Lord."</P>
<P>BY exerci&s;ing your&s;elves in the duties of piety, in reading, meditation and prayer, you will &s;weetly ex|perience the fulfilment of his gracious promi&s;e, "to keep them in all their way who commit them&s;elves to him." Make the word of God your &s;tudy; and the divine and animating promi&s;es &s;cattered thro' the &s;acred volume, the plea&s;ing &s;ubject of your de|vout and daily meditation. "When wi&s;dom enter|eth into thy heart, and knowledge is plea&s;ant unto
<PB N="228" REF="028999_0218_0FDDD246D1EA5590">thy &s;oul, di&s;cretion &s;hall pre&s;erve thee, under&s;tand|ing &s;hall keep thee, to deliver thee from the way of evil men,&mdash;and from the &s;trange woman that flat|tereth with her words, which for&s;aketh the guide of her youth and forgeteth the covenant of her God, for her hou&s;e inclineth unto death:&mdash;that thou may|e&s;t walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous."</P>
<P>LET a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of God, be deeply and perpetually impre&s;&s;ed upon your minds, as the mo&s;t powerful &s;ecurity again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.&mdash; Thus fortified by a principle of virtue, tho' a&s;&s;ault|ed, as was once a pious Jo&s;eph in the hou&s;e of Pot|ipher; with chri&s;tian heroi&s;m you will overcome; &s;aying, "how can I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?" Thus guarded again&s;t this de&s;iling &s;in, you will readily &s;hun all indecent familiarity and every degree of wantonne&s;s. You will maintain a a mode&s;ty and manline&s;s of deportment, and cha&s;ti|ty in all your thoughts and conver&s;ation. And may it plea&s;e God, who liberally di&s;pen&s;es his grace to them that a&s;k, to &s;trengthen your youthful re&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tions in the ways of innocency and virtue, that &s;o you may be happily qualified for a u&s;eful life, comfort in old age, &s;erenity in death, and felicity immortal be|yond the grave.</P>
<P>WHILE I would faithfully warn the youth, in the language of the apo&s;tle, to "flee fornication," and all degrees of uncha&s;tity; and affectionately invite them to the practice of virtue; I cannot refrain from expre&s;&s;ing a fear, that in too many in&s;tances the guils of the more &s;candalous violations of this divine law, by tho&s;e in younger life, lies at the door of the neg|ligent perents: Who, like indulgent Eli, &s;uffer their children to be vile without reproof. Are there not families in this chri&s;tian land, in which the name of
<PB N="229" REF="028999_0219_0FDDD2485091BEB8">God is rarely mentioned, except in profane di&s;cour&s;e, and his wor&s;hip unknown&mdash;in which children are &s;uf|fered to grow up in ignorance of the duties of reli|gion, and in the practice of vice; in idlene&s;s, in night walking, and other vices which lead on to the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Let parents recollect that chil|dren are committed to them as a &s;olemn charge;&mdash; and that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey loo&s;e &s;alvation by their neglect, their &s;ouls will be required at their hands.</P>
<P>MAY the le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom find welcome acce&s;s to all our minds, and the grace of God pre&s;erve us from evil. May the ri&s;ing generation con&s;ecrate their youthful vigor of body and mind, to the hon|or of him who died for them and hath called them into his holy kingdom: and O mo&s;t divine and af|fectionate Saviour! who will &s;ay at the la&s;t day, to his faithful friends, "He that overcometh, &s;hall in|herit all things, and I will be his God, and he &s;hall be my &s;on." In the hope of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, with humble dependance on his efficacious grace, let us keep his commandments with a pure heart and un|blamable life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our only Lord and Redeemer.</P>

<P>THIS precept of the law immediately re&s;pects the worldly property of mankind. It implies that it is the will of God that men &s;hould have pro|perty, which they may exclu&s;ively call their own.&mdash; It is his gift to men, to po&s;&s;e&s;s, u&s;e and enjoy, in the way and manner which he hath been plea&s;ed to di|rect, which are for his glory, and the good and hap|pine&s;s of our&s;elves and others. "Thou &s;halt not &s;teal." Thou &s;halt not, by fraud or violence deprive another of his lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; or take his prop|erty without his con&s;ent. This law has a primary effect to per&s;onal and private property. The con|&s;ent of the owner, in certain ca&s;es, is di&s;pen&s;ed with, when the public good makes it nece&s;&s;ary to invade per&s;onal property; but the moral law obliges the public to make compen&s;ation. This precept equal|ly enforces the po&s;itive obligations of ju&s;tice and kindne&s;s, in endeavors to &s;ecure and pre&s;erve the goods and property of others. All the good qual|ities included in the terms hone&s;ty, benevolence and kindne&s;s, in all our intercour&s;e with mankind, are contained in the intention of this law. In the ex|planation of the moral duties compri&s;ed in it, I &s;hall &s;peak.</P>

<P N="1">1. MEN have temporal or worldly property, which ought to be &s;acredly guarded from inva&s;ion and plunder. All property or whatever men may call their own, is from God the &s;upreme proprietor of all things; by who&s;e creating power and providence, all things are brought from nothing and pre&s;erved. All things being the ab&s;olute property of God, his right to di&s;po&s;e of them to whom he plea&s;es, is un|controled. He gives earthly goods to men. He hath &s;et the bounds of our habitation and divided to nations and to individuals their inheritance. By expre&s;s revelation, the Mo&s;t High gave to the de|&s;cendents of Abraham the land of Canaan; and mount Seir, to the children of E&s;au. Men do not however, come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of territory or worldly property by revelation; but by the favour of providence, according to the order of nature and the laws of &s;ociety. Men being inve&s;ted with prop|erty, by the ordering of providence, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s; have an exclu&s;ive right thereto, and no one may di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s another of the goods which he has lawfully acquired. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of individual property is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of mankind, and the welfare of &s;ociety. Were all property in common, all things would be in confu&s;ion,&mdash;the &s;trong would every where di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s the weak, and univer&s;al langour and idlene&s;s prevail. That the laborer &s;hould be entitled to the
<PB N="233" REF="028999_0222_0FDDD25305C29C00">fruits of his indu&s;try, is a powerful motive to per&s;on|al exertion and enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are various modes or means of obtaining the rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, as by inheritance, will, gift, purcha&s;e, indu&s;try and enterpri&s;e in &s;ome lawful calling. What a man obtains in the&s;e ways, he holds, under God, as his own. They are to be u&s;ed and employed by him, agreeably to the will of the &s;overeign proprietor, who be&s;tows them. It is robbery in another to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without the con&s;ent of the owner. Every man, however, who enters into or enjoys the advantages of &s;ociety, gives his con&s;ent, either per&s;onally or otherwi&s;e, that his property &s;hall contribute, according to certain rules, e&s;tabli&s;hed to the &s;upport of the civil, moral and re|ligious in&s;titutions of &s;ociety; becau&s;e by the&s;e his property is &s;ecured from inva&s;ion, and his injuries redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE are other properties which men enjoy, and of which they may not be di&s;poiled, &s;uch as, a good name, which is more valuable than riches,&mdash; of their opportunities to do good to mankind,&mdash;of their liberty and peace, and right to wor&s;hip God, according to their own con&s;ciences, &amp; the advantages which providence gives to men for their progre&s;s in u&s;eful knowledge and their eternal &s;alvation. He who abridges or deprives others of the&s;e, is a violator of this law. Men become the rightful owners of goods acquired by lawful means, and the moral law, and the laws of &s;ociety, give them a title to the &s;ole and ab&s;olute u&s;e of them. Every man has a right to do as he plea&s;es with his property, provided he does not counteract the benevolent purpo&s;es of providence in the application of its gifts.</P>

<HI>THEFT</HI> in its gro&s;s &s;en&s;e is taking the goods of a man by violence. By the judicial laws of Mo&s;es the man who killed a thief breaking into his hou&s;e in the night, was not puni&s;hed. This crime is next to murder in guilt. The per&s;on who is attacked in the dark and filent hours devoted to repo&s;e, has not the advantage of defending him&s;elf or his property. An aver&s;ion to labour, or to hone&s;t indu&s;try, is com|monly the motive to the crimes of theft and robbe|ry.

<P>PROPERTY is a tru&s;t which the &s;upreme proprietor has committed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, to be u&s;ed as he has directed, and to be accounted for, with other talents, to him who gave it. No one may lawfully take from another that betru&s;tment. It is an inva&s;ion of the prerogative of the Deity, who gives or takes away. "It is the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord that maketh rich;" and his providence only may rightfully take back the goods committed to men. I &s;hall mention in &s;undry particulars the ways or means by which this divine law is broken.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="235" REF="028999_0224_0FDDD25A966FE198">
1. BY taking advantage of the ignorance, or ne|ce&s;&s;ities of others, to make gain. This is a wicked "oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor and him that hath no help|er." To overreach another in trade or bu&s;ine&s;s, is not only an act of di&s;hone&s;ty and fraud committed a|gain&s;t one who is le&s;s knowing or &s;u&s;picious; but a criminal perver&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;uperior abilities which are given to him, who commits the injury. It is an act of ingratitude to God, and inju&s;tice to man. To make gain of the nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e who are in &s;traits thro' want, is an act of robbery and cruelty.&mdash; It is impiety towards God and unmercifulne&s;s to men. Next to the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion, is that of refu|&s;ing compa&s;&s;ion and aid to tho&s;e, who by the divine providence are in &s;uffering circum&s;tances. "If a brother or a &s;i&s;ter be naked and de&s;titute of daily food, and one of you &s;ay unto them depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled: notwith&s;tanding ye give them not tho&s;e things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?" It is a &s;olemn con&s;ideration, which &s;hould arre&s;t the attention of all men, that our Lord, in his de&s;cription of the final condemnation to be pa&s;&s;ed upon the wicked, makes the withhold|ing of compa&s;&s;ion and alms from our &s;uffering brethren, and e&s;pecially from the poor of the hou&s;hold of faith, the cau&s;e of that condemnation. "Then &s;hall the judge &s;ay unto them on the left hand, de|part from me,&mdash;For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat: I was thir&s;ty and ye gave me no drink: a &s;tranger and ye took me not in: naked and ye clothed me not: &s;ick, and in pri&s;on and ye vi&s;ited me not."</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS precept condemns unlawful u&s;ury. The jews were forbidden to exact u&s;ury of each other, al|tho' they were allowed to take it of other people, who re&s;ided among them, for the purpo&s;e of traffic.
<PB N="236" REF="028999_0225_0FDDD25C8F55B478">The &s;in con&s;i&s;ts not in demanding u&s;ury or intere&s;t, but in exacting more than is ju&s;t and equitable. It al&s;o condemns monopolizing the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;a|ry to the &s;upport of life. This is making an artifi|cial &s;carcity, that the engro&s;&s;er may make great gain. Jo&s;eph in Egypt, being divinely warned of an ap|proaching famine of &s;even years continuance, wi&s;ely expended the trea&s;ures of the kingdom, during &s;even preceeding years of plenty, to purcha&s;e the produce of the land. He was influenced &s;o to do, not by the mean and mercenary motive of enriching him&s;elf, but the generous and noble principle of &s;aving a na|tion from the horrors of famine. In the years of &s;carcity, he liberally dealt out the trea&s;ures which he had accumulated, and made a people joyful in the mid&s;t of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing judgment. Far different from this, is the ca&s;e of that &s;elfi&s;h mortal, who purcha&s;es up the nece&s;&s;aries of life, with a view to make a &s;carcity, which providence never intended, that he may gra&s;p the wealth and &s;ub&s;tance of others.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS law is broken by per&s;ons wa&s;ting their goods by idlene&s;s, intemperance and prodigality. Worldly goods are a trea&s;ure which God commits to men, as &s;tewards, to be u&s;ed for good and u&s;eful purpo&s;es. They are a talent for which men mu&s;t give account. They are not to be expended in the exce&s;&s;ive gratification of the fle&s;h or fancy. No man has an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> right to do as his plea&s;ure may dictate, even with his own. In the u&s;e and improvement of his goods, his duty is to con&s;ult the plea&s;ure of him, from who&s;e providence he received them, that the apo&s;tle &s;ays of chri&s;tians, "ye are not your own;" may be &s;aid of men's wealth and goods, "they are not your's." They are bought by the blood of Chri&s;t, and for his &s;ake, are intru&s;ted to you, to u&s;e and employ, to the glory of the giver,
<PB N="237" REF="028999_0226_0FDDD25E5AA18528">your own and the be&s;t good of others. As men are to glorify God in their bodies and in their &s;pirits which are God's; &s;o al&s;o are they to glorify him in their worldly goods, which are his al&s;o. He then who wa&s;tes his property by idlene&s;s, intemperance and other vices, is chargable with embezzling his Lord's goods, robbing him&s;elf, his family and &s;el|low men. He who created food to &s;atisfy the hun|gry multitude, taught his di&s;ciples oeconomy, &s;ay|ing, "gather up the fragments, that nothing be lo&s;t." The mi&s;improvers of the gifts and bounties of providence, deprive them&s;elves of the comfortable enjoyment of them, and of the means of communi|cating comfort to others, and reduce them&s;elves to wretchedne&s;s. "He that loveth plea&s;ure &s;hall be a poor man. He that loveth &s;trong drink &s;hall not be rich. The drunkard and the glutton &s;hall come to poverty, and drou&s;ine&s;s &s;hall cloth a man with rags."</P>
<P>PERSONS are liable to injure them&s;elves or others by ra&s;hly adventuring in trade,&mdash;by becoming &s;ure|ties for others,&mdash;by lavi&s;hing property in the grati|fitation of the pride of dre&s;s, building, equipage and the o&s;tentatious parade of life. A large propor|tion of precious time and expence are too often be&s;towed on the &s;uperfluities of life. Whatever is beyond the point of decency and convenience, in the mode of living, is a criminal wa&s;te of property. It is be&s;towing on things of &s;mall con&s;equence, that which might be u&s;efully employed. The &s;uperfluities of the rich and gay, would make comfortable the families of want and &s;orrow; and be an offering acceptable to him, who hath commanded us to do good and to communicate; with the a&s;&s;urance that with &s;uch facrifices God is well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, this precept is violated by
<PB N="238" REF="028999_0227_0FDD5FE318E513D0">tho&s;e who rob them&s;elves and families, of tho&s;e enjoyments of life which God hath given them, thro' a penurious and avaricious di&s;po&s;ition. Who, in the mid&s;t of plenty, &s;tarve them&s;elves, le&s;t at &s;ome future time, they &s;hould come to want. This is that &s;in of covetou&s;ne&s;s, which the apo&s;tle calls idol|atry. It is a criminal di&s;tru&s;t of divine providence; and is an evil more often found among the rich than the poor; and mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a cur&s;e attend|ing the inordinate love of money. To pine over plenty, and &s;uffer thro' fear of &s;uffering, is ingrati|tude to heaven, and contrary to pre&s;ent experience of its bountifulne&s;s. This is the de&s;picable condition of the mi&s;er, who broods over his wealth, and fears a thou&s;and wants; who clothes him&s;elf in rags, and denies his body its proper nouri&s;hments, and dies poor in the mid&s;t of opulence. He leaves his hoarded trea&s;ures, when he can hold them no longer, to tho&s;e who feel no gratitude for his memory. "There is, &s;ays Solomon, that &s;cattereth and yet increa&s;eth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty. Bountifulne&s;s is as a fruitful garden and mercifulne&s;s endureth forever." A covetous di&s;po&s;ition is a fource of unhappine&s;s, to the per&s;on who indulges it, and to others. The temptations ari&s;ing from a redundancy of wealth, as well as of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing poverty, were fore&s;een by the wi&s;e and pious prophet Agur, who in prayer to God, &s;ays, <HI>"give me neither poverty, nor riches, le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay who is the Lord? or le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal and take the name of my God in vain."</HI> That exce&s;&s;ive anxiety for the goods of this world, which robs the &s;ons of men of peace and re&s;t, was one of the evils which the royal preacher &s;aw under the &s;un. "There is one alone and there is not a &s;econd; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor, neither is his eye
<PB N="239" REF="028999_0228_0FDDD25F976EEE90">&s;atisfied with riches, neither &s;aith he, for whom do I labor and bereave my &s;oul of good."</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS precept is violated by litigious laws &s;uits. In this way, there is frequently robbery committed on men's goods, reputation and peace. It is lawful for a chri&s;tian to appeal to ju&s;tice and the laws, for protection from the lawle&s;s, and the re&s;titution of right. "For the law is good if a man u&s;e it lawfully." But this nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titution is abu&s;ed when per&s;ons under the &s;helter of law, injure others in unju&s;t pro&s;ecutions, which it may not be in the power of the law to detect: in hara&s;&s;ing the patience of others by appeals and delays, with a view of forcing them to unrea&s;onable terms. This is robbing by legal forms, and is one of the wor&s;t &s;pecies of theft, becau&s;e it is &s;heltered from puni&s;hment or re&s;titution. The apo&s;tle reproves the chri&s;tians at Corinth for their contentions at law; and recommends to them rather to &s;uffer wrong, than contend; or to leave their controver&s;ies to the deci&s;ion of impartial arbi|trators in the church.</P>
<P>ON the chri&s;tian's right to &s;eek a redre&s;s of injuries by appealing to the laws of the country, I would notice an objection which is alledged by &s;ome, founded on the words of Chri&s;t, Matthew 5, and which are thought to forbid going to law in any ca&s;e. "Re&s;i&s;t not evil. But who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o. And if any man &s;hall &s;ue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak al&s;o." Two things are evident here, one is, the duty of chri&s;tians to bear injuries with meekne&s;s; the other, that the&s;e are proverbial phra&s;es, and not to be under&s;tood literally. And it al&s;o appears that the le&s;&s;es were in &s;maller matters. It is better to give a coat for peace, than by contending, to loo&s;e all one's clothes. It is a
<PB N="240" REF="028999_0229_0FDDD265E637EF80">duty to give up things of &s;mall value, rather than contend at law. And it was the duty of chri&s;tians, in tho&s;e times e&s;pecially, with patient meekne&s;s to &s;uffer lo&s;s; for they were the objects of the hatred and per&s;ecutions of Jews and Gentiles; and there was but a &s;lender pro&s;pect of their obtaining ju&s;tice, by appealing to the courts of their per&s;onal enemies. That the phra&s;e of turning the other cheek to him that &s;mites, was proverbial, and de&s;igned to recom|mend in general the virtue of meekne&s;s, is evident from our Lord's example, who when he was unju&s;tly &s;mitten on the cheek, by one of the officers, re|proved him for the injury, &s;aying, "if I have &s;poken evil, bear witne&s;s of the evil, but if well, why &s;mite&s;t thou me." And &s;aint Paul, when un|ju&s;tly &s;mitten by command of the high prie&s;t re&s;en|ted the indignity, and pronounces upon him a pro|phetic judgment. We hence conclude that our Lord forbids a &s;pirit of litigation among chri&s;tians; but does not deprive them of the privileges of &s;o|ciety, in the redre&s;s of in&s;ufferable injuries. This explanation of our Saviour's words may &s;erve as an an&s;wer to a like objection, from a pa&s;&s;age in 1 Cor|inthians v. 7. "Dare any of you having a matter again&s;t another, go to law before the unju&s;t and not before the &s;aints?" This refers to differences which may be accommodated by judicious neighbors. "I &s;peak to your &s;hame. Is it &s;o that there is not a wi&s;e man among you, not one that &s;hall be able to judge between his brethren? This is utterly a fault among you, becau&s;e ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather &s;uffer your&s;elves to be defrauded?" Too much of this, to the &s;candal to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, yet remains among the profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples of the meek and patient Je&s;us. "Who, when he was reviled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eviled not again; when he &s;uffered he threatened
<PB N="241" REF="028999_0230_0FDDD267C34F07D8">not, but committed him&s;elf to him who judgeth righteou&s;ly.</P>
<P N="5">5. ALL the di&s;hone&s;t arts and tricks of jugglers and fortune-tellers, who deceive and defraud; are condemned by this law. They who fear God, will &s;hun their impious ways. They are the works of darkne&s;s. The entrance of true religion into the heart, will detect and expel the&s;e wicked arts. "Many of them which u&s;ed curious arts, brought their books together and burned them before all men." This law al&s;o condemns the non-perform|ance of promi&s;es, where promi&s;es are lawful, and per&s;ons have ability to fulfil;&mdash;running in debt with|out the pro&s;pect of payment; and delays of pay|ment to laborers and creditors. "Owe no man any thing." All bribery in judgment, and partiality in deci&s;ions, between men; all tho&s;e kind of prefe&s;&s;ions which are &s;upported by the vices and follies of men; all gambling and &s;ports of chance, in which property is hazarded, are condemned by this law. It forbids withholding &s;upport from the government under which we live, and from the wor&s;hip of God, and public moral and religious in&s;titutions. It condemns all perjury, forgery and couzenage; all fraudulent alienation of things devoted to charitable and &s;acred u&s;es; concealing lo&s;t goods and embezzling the property of others; partaking of di&s;hone&s;t gains or &s;tolen goods, and all tho&s;e ways which tend to the in|jury of our neighbor, either in his per&s;on, his pro|perty or reputation.</P>
<P>LASTLY: It condemns man-&s;tealing. This is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t criminal &s;pecies of theft. Com|mon theft robs a man of his property; but this robs him of him&s;elf. The thief, takes not only the goods of a man, but the man him&s;elf; and makes gain by
<PB N="242" REF="028999_0231_0FDDD269B16D5200">the barter of human fle&s;h. The &s;lave-trade, &s;o called, comes under this condemnation. To the &s;candal of the chri&s;tian religion, this unnatural and cruel traf|fic, has been practi&s;ed by European nations and their colonies, more than two centuries, and is not yet aboli&s;hed. Thou&s;ands of the unhappy children of Africa, our equals by nature, are draged from their native lands, loaded with irons, and crouded into floating pri&s;ons: and during a long voyage, acro&s;s the Atlantic, are &s;ubjected to all manner of &s;ufferings and death. They are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and bought, and made to &s;ubmit to the &s;evere&s;t toil, and tortur|ed, at the plea&s;ure of their cruel ma&s;ters. They pine away in a foreign land, and their hard bondage is continually imbittered, with the recollection of the liberties and plea&s;ures of their native country, and all the tender &s;ympathies of dome&s;tic life, forever fled from them. Death comes to them, a welcome refuge. Thou&s;ands are annually imported. While the people of this our favored land, double their numbers in a few years, the imported Africans in the colonies decrea&s;e, and the race would &s;oon be extinct, were there not continual acce&s;&s;ions to &s;upply the deficiency. Enlightened people of Europe and America, what injuries have you or your fathers re|ceived, to ju&s;tify your cruel &s;everety to tho&s;e un|fortunate defencele&s;s people? Humanity and re|ligion drop a tear over you, ye degenerate chri&s;tians who deal in the "merchandize of &s;laves and &s;ouls of men."</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al parent of his creatures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who has made of one blood all nations, to dwell in all the earth," and given them equal natural rights, is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. His divine law has cla&s;&s;ed men-&s;tealers, and tho&s;e who participate in this crime, among the mo&s;t enormous offenders. "The law
<PB N="243" REF="028999_0232_0FDDD26E9ADBE290">is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, the ungodly and &s;inners,&mdash;for mur|derers of fathers and murderers of mothers, and for men-&s;tealers."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such is the ardent thir&s;t of wealth in the heart of man, that rea&s;ons drawn from the principles of humanity and religion, make but feeble impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who receive gain from this traffic.

The powerful republic of France have al&s;o aboli&s;hed &s;lavery; and generous efforts have been made in the Briti&s;h parliament to put a &s;top to the African &s;lave-trade.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS xx. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have con&s;idered the nature and guilt of the &s;ins prohibited by this divine precept. Let me now, invite your con&s;ideration,</P>
<P N="3">3. To the po&s;itive duties which it enjoins. Its po&s;itive duties are, to pre&s;erve the properties and promote the intere&s;ts of our fellow men, by all lawful means. The precept, "thou &s;halt not &s;teal," re|quires not only a total ab&s;tinence from the &s;ins for|bidden, and which have been enumerated; but like the other negative precept, it commands the oppo&s;ite duties and virtues: that men &s;hould be, not only negatively virtuous, and do no harm, but that they be po&s;itively good, beneficient and u&s;eful. The property of our fellow men, to which this law pri|marily relates, re&s;pects their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> their <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>reputation.</HI> The&s;e comprehend all the worldly goods of men, and which we are to pre&s;erve and defend, as we would our own.</P>
<P N="1">1. HONESTY is a virtue, which we are &s;acredly to ob&s;erve, in all our dealings with men. It is directly oppo&s;ed to the vice of knavery, which prompts
<PB N="246" REF="028999_0234_0FDDD270C59411F0">per&s;ons to take advantage of others. Let us, &s;ays St. Paul, walk hone&s;tly as in the day. "In all things willing to live none&s;tly." The hone&s;t man is con&s;cientious in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ings with others, and would do them no injury, altho' his pre&s;ent intere&s;t might be increa&s;ed thereby. He is the &s;ame in all his commerce with mankind, whether in &s;ecret or in public. He would rather &s;uffer lo&s;s him&s;elf, then defraud another; even tho' the fraud could be con|cealed from the knowledge of the world. By this principle, the upright man is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the artful and de&s;igning. The latter will not he&s;itate to take an advantage of another, when it can be done without a di&s;covery.

<P N="2">2. THE moral and the chri&s;tian law concur in de|manding of men, that they do to others as they would that others &s;hould do to them. "As ye would that men &s;hould do to you do ye even &s;o to them." This is the golden rule of univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s towards men. It directs us to deal with others, as we are con&s;cious, they ought to deal with us. It is comprehen&s;ive and intelligible and calculated for daily u&s;e. It implies that we allow our&s;elves a moment's con&s;ideration, and imagine our&s;elves in the condition of him, with whom we have to do, and impartially a&s;k our&s;elves, what we ought to expect, and then do accordingly. Were this mo&s;t ju&s;t rule in univer&s;al u&s;e, all fraud, op|pre&s;&s;ion, cruelty and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s would cea&s;e, and the good fruits of ju&s;tice and beneficence abound. Our love to our&s;elves would be the rule and mea|&s;ure of our conduct to others; and men would have no more inclination to injure others, than them&s;elves.

"Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf," is the great commandment of the law.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, by a parable,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 10.</NOTE> has in a lively manner, exemplified the great guilt of the &s;in prohibited by this precept, and the amiablene&s;s of the oppo&s;ite virtue. In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, "Who is my neighbor?" Je&s;us &s;aid, "A certain man went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, and fell among thieves which &s;tripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain prie&s;t that way; and when he &s;aw him he pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. And likewi&s;e a Levite, when he was at the place came and looked on him, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide." The wounded traveller looked up to the&s;e as kind angels from heaven, come to bind up his wounds and recal to life, his departing &s;pirit: for they were his countrymen, and mini&s;ters of peace, and preachers of mercy. But alas, they turned their faces from the piteous &s;pectacle, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. "Compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour! are there any of thy mini&s;ters &s;o lo&s;t to the tenderne&s;s of &s;ympathy and pity! They are unwor|thy the &s;acred office, and di&s;honor thy benevolent religion." But compa&s;&s;ion and kindne&s;s are &s;ome|times found, where they are lea&s;t expected. "But a certain Samaritan," who&s;e nation was ho&s;tile to the jews, "as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he &s;aw him he had compa&s;&s;ion on him; and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and &s;et him on his own bea&s;t and bro't him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A roman penny was about one &s;eventh of a dollar.</NOTE>
<PB N="248" REF="028999_0236_0FDDD273B5C99F70">and gave them to the ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto him, take care of him: and what&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t more, when I come again I will repay thee." The good Samaritan &s;aw in the wounded Jew, a fellow creature, a brother in di&s;tre&s;s. And he ha&s;tened to his relief. He did, as he would that another &s;hould do to him, in like circum&s;tances. By this parable our Lord has taught us, that there is no man, but what is our neighbour: whether he be our country|man or a foreigner. And that when a fellow creature is in di&s;tre&s;s, and lies at our mercy, we are to do our utmo&s;t to relieve him, even tho' an enemy; and one, who&s;e political or religious creed may be altogether oppo&s;ite to our own.</P>
<P>FROM this example, enforced by the &s;hort, but exten&s;ive command of Je&s;us, "go thou and do like|wi&s;e;" may we learn the practice, and imbibe the lovely &s;pirit of his religion, who in his life and death di&s;played the virtues of an unbounded philanthropy. He is him&s;elf the good Samaritan, who came into the wilderne&s;s of this world, to &s;eek and &s;ave them that are lo&s;t. Who finds us on the highway of danger and death, who delivers us out of the hands of our &s;piritual foes, tho&s;e robbers of our peace and murderers of &s;ouls. Who has compa&s;&s;ion on us, and binds up the wounds of &s;in and guilt, pouring into the troubled &s;oul, the oil of grace, and the wine of divine con&s;olation, who gives deliverance to cap|tives and freedom to them that are bound. Who pays for our healing, with his own blood, and rai&s;es us from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s, and carries us in the arms of his redeeming love and mercy, to the cele&s;tial man&s;ions.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS law requires of us fidelity in every tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us. Whatever duty is con&s;ided to us to
<PB N="249" REF="028999_0237_0FDDD27BAC3BFD68">perty fraudulently taken. He who has a ju&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion of his obligation to God, will be di&s;po&s;|ed to make all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction for an injury done to another, of whatever kind the injury may be. When convinced of the &s;in of inju&s;tice, mo&s;t free and cordial was the confe&s;&s;ion of the Publican Zaccheus, &amp; his re&s;olution to make ample &s;atisfac|tion, to all to whom he had been unju&s;t. "He &s;tood and &s;aid, if I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him four fold." It is a dictate of the immutable law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he who wrongs another, either in his per|&s;on, property or character, &s;hould repair the inju|ry, by full confe&s;&s;ion and re&s;titution. If the in|jury is &s;ecret, there are ways which the offender may take to re&s;tore and make re&s;titution, without making it publicly known. Tho' the party who is injured in his property be dead, yet the injuri|ous per&s;on may not keep it, becau&s;e it is not his. He may do well to di&s;tribute it to the poor. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of this law, is fir&s;t to confe&s;s to God, his &s;in, imploring forgivene&s;s, and nextly to make &s;atisfaction to the party injured. In vain will the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or expect peace and comfort, while he retains the goods of others, or refu&s;es to &s;atisfy. Con&s;cious guilt breaks his peace, and the terrors of God's broken law alarm his fears. "Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts," and practi&s;e the pure laws of ju&s;|tice and mercy.</P>
<P>As the material world is kept together, by the laws of attraction, and the heavenly bodies re|volve around each other in admirable order, beauty and u&s;efulne&s;s; &s;o the moral world is to be kept together by the attractive principle of love
<PB N="250" REF="028999_0238_0FDDD27CB69A93A0">and benevolence. Material bodies would di&s;|&s;olve &amp; be &s;cattered &amp; lo&s;t in the boundle&s;s univer&s;e, were a principle of repul&s;ion inherent in every particle of matter. And were univer&s;al inju&s;tice and wrong to prevail, &s;ociety would di&s;&s;olve and the human race no more exi&s;t. The &s;elfi&s;h man, who builds his intere&s;t on the rein of his fel|low men, may hence &s;ee the evil of his conduct, &s;hould inju&s;tice and robbery become univer&s;al. In this deplorable condition of the world all men would arm again&s;t all men, and every man's hand be turned again&s;t his neighbor.</P>
<P>As the evils forbidden by this precept are at|tended with per&s;onal and univer&s;al ruin, we infer the obligations of men to cultivate the oppo&s;ite virtues of hone&s;ty, kindne&s;s, mercifulne&s;s, for|givene&s;s, and every good di&s;po&s;ition and action, which rends to advance the intere&s;ts and happi|ne&s;s of mankind, and the exerci&s;e of that love, that worketh no ill to our neighbour.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the duty of promoting the &s;piritual edification and &s;alvation of our fellow-men, is re|quired by this law. The love of our neighbor as our&s;elves, will di&s;po&s;e us heartily to &s;eek his inter|e&s;ts in all re&s;pects; and as his &s;alvation is the greate&s;t, to promote it, will be an object of the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire and labor of every one, who&s;e heart is rightly affected towards his fellow men. Do we e&s;teem it a moral and &s;acred duty to guard the per&s;on, the property and character of our neighbor, and &s;hall we e&s;teem it a duty of le&s;s importance, to &s;ecure his eternal happine&s;s, by every wi&s;e and benevolent means in our power? By good example, by friendly in&s;truction, warn|ing,
<PB N="251" REF="028999_0239_0FDDD27E6F1423A8">direction and prayer? Earne&s;tly de&s;iring that when he &s;hall leave this world's goods at death, his &s;oul may be happy: that he may po&s;|&s;e&s;s tho&s;e &s;piritual riches, of which death and the grave cannot deprive him, but which will forever increa&s;e in value? And that when his earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions fail him, he may be received into tho&s;e everla&s;ting habitations, which the Almighty and merciful redeemer gives to every believing and obedient di&s;ciple. Unle&s;s we &s;incerely de&s;ire, and labor to promote the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men, we are de&s;titute of that true and exten&s;ive love to them, which the law of God demands from us; becau&s;e this is the be&s;t intere&s;t, &amp; the &s;ublime&s;t happine&s;s, of which they are capable. Compar|ed to which, their temporal pro&s;perity, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of the whole world, are but of trifling importance. "For what &s;hall it profit a man, if he &s;hould gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul?" Having &s;hewn in &s;un|dry particulars, the &s;ins prohibited, and the duties demanded by this general precept, let me invite you to &s;ome Reflections.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;ee the guilt and danger of an inordi|nate love of riches. It is the root of all evil. The &s;ource of inju&s;tice, di&s;hone&s;tly, theft and rob|bery. "Love not the world neither the things of the world." To cheri&s;h an ardent thir&s;t for the goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this life, opens the door for manifold temptations. "He that mak|eth ha&s;te to be rich, hath an evil eye. He &s;hall not be innocent." Through the prevalence of a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, he will be tempted to do his neigh|bor wrong. They who pur&s;ue riches, as the fir&s;t and greate&s;t object of happine&s;s, fall into temp|tation and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h &amp; hurt|ful
<PB N="252" REF="028999_0240_0FDDD283A59FF928">lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE infer the ruinous nature and con&s;equen|ces of the crime of theft. It is a violation of the laws of God and of &s;ociety; of ju&s;tice, truth, hone&s;ty and charity; and mo&s;t di&s;graceful and hurtful to the criminal. The gro&s;&s;er kinds of theft, as public robbery; the more refined kind, as taking advantage of the wants or ignorance of others: and the more &s;ecret theft, which clande&s;|tinely takes or embezzles the goods of others, &amp; every &s;pecies of di&s;hone&s;ty, in our commerce with mankind, are condemned. "Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more." Let him humble him&s;elf before God, and make re&s;titution to tho&s;e he has injured. This &s;in e&s;pecially requires repentance towards God, becau&s;e the thief boldly a&s;&s;umes the divine prerogative, and takes from others the goods which God has committed to them. It is an act of great impiety, as well as inju&s;tice. The dar|ing breakers of this law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, are de&s;titute of the fear of God, and unalarmed at the threatened terrors of his wrath. God hath pro|nounced a wide wa&s;ting cur&s;e on this &s;in. "It &s;hall enter into the hou&s;e of the thief,"&mdash;it &s;hall pur&s;ue him into his mo&s;t &s;ecret retirement&mdash;"It &s;hall remain in the mid&s;t of his hou&s;e and &s;hall con&s;ume it with the timber thereof, &amp; the &s;tones thereof." Shame and lo&s;s u&s;ually attend this vice, in <HI>this</HI> life, and eternal puni&s;hment awaits it in the next. The unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of other men's goods, is deprived of peace and &s;atisfaction in the u&s;e of them. An accu&s;ing con&s;cience &s;poils his enjoyment. Bel&s;hazzer trembled at an impious fea&s;t, while he drank wine in the golden bowls, &s;tolen from the temple of Jehovah. What con|&s;olation
<PB N="253" REF="028999_0241_0FDDD28510D53440">did the thief Judas find, in the thirty pieces of &s;ilver, to obtain which, he robbed his Lord of life? Ill-gotten riches tormented his con&s;cience. He &s;ought to find peace, by re&s;tor|ing them. In vain he threw them at the feet of the partners of his crime. They derided him in his &s;orrows. Horror of con&s;cience will come up|on tho&s;e who live and die in this &s;in.</P>
<P>THIS crime is commonly di&s;covered. It begins in &s;ecret, but is at la&s;t brought to light. The rea&s;on is, that a repetition of this &s;in, hardens and emboldens the &s;inner. If he is once &s;ucce&s;sful, and e&s;capes undetected, he is encouraged to re|peat the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, until it becomes a habit, &amp; &s;o open and frequent, that it is ea&s;ily di&s;covered. Though like Judas, who was a thief, per&s;ons of this character, may for a &s;ea&s;on pa&s;s undi&s;covered, yet will their iniquity find them out. They are hateful to God and men. Mankind readily pur|&s;ue and puni&s;h a thief, becau&s;e he is a common foe. No tru&s;t or confidence can be repo&s;ed in him. He is feared and &s;hunned: and when it is no longer &s;afe to &s;uffer him to go at large, he is &s;ecluded from &s;ociety; or fini&s;hes a mi&s;erable life by an ig|nominious death. The guilt of his crimes follow him, beyond death. Unworthy to live on earth, he will be &s;hut out from the &s;ociety of the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men, and condemned to the pri&s;on of e|ternal darkne&s;s and de&s;pair, where peculiar wrath awaits the enemies of God and man.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET this &s;ubject be improved in a way of examination of our own hearts; whether we have in daily exerci&s;e that benevolent principle, towards our fellow men, which inclines us to &s;eek their good, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, in all re&s;pects.
<PB N="254" REF="028999_0242_0FDDD2867351D140">Have we, &s;irs, &s;uch a love to our neighbor, as di&s;po&s;es us to rejoice in his pro&s;perity, and to pro|mote, as far as it may be in our power, his tempo|ral and eternal intere&s;ts? Altho' we decrea&s;e, do we rejoice at his increa&s;e, &amp; feel not the emotion of envy and &s;orrow? The benevolent &s;pirit of the religion of Je&s;us will di&s;po&s;e you to rejoice with them that rejoice; as well as weep, with them that weep. Does your love to your neighbor extend to the great intere&s;ts of their &s;ouls, and di&s;po&s;e you to u&s;e all proper means to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to &s;ecure their &s;alvation? By &s;orrow for the &s;ins of others, by friendly admonition in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, and by fervent prayer, that God would give them re|pentance unto life? Are you grieved when you behold the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e God is di&s;honor|ed, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors expo&s;ed to awful puni&s;h|ment? Unle&s;s you thus love the &s;ouls of men, &amp; &s;eek their &s;piritual and eternal happine&s;s, you have no true love to their per&s;ons. Suffer not &s;in then upon a brother for whom Chri&s;t died. Strive to bring him to the knowledge of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed God and Saviour. In this way you will promote his be&s;t, his immortal intere&s;ts, and incline him al&s;o to practi&s;e the duties of righteou&s;ne&s;s towards men: for he who loves God will love his neigh|bor al&s;o.</P>
<P N="4">4. OF the &s;in which this &s;ubject condemns, children and youth, are e&s;pecially in danger. A principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and a di&s;po&s;ition to en|gro&s;s the goods of others, are often di&s;covered in early life. A di&s;hone&s;t principle uncontroled in childhood, is in danger of growing into an incon|querable habit. Tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who have been brought to public puni&s;hment and death, for the crimes of theft and robbery, have common|ly
<PB N="255" REF="028999_0243_0FDDD28CEE2DC318">been of that cla&s;s of families, in which di&s;|hone&s;ty in childhood, has met with unre&s;trained indulgence. This vice brings parents to &s;hame, and children to ruin.</P>
<P>Let me affectionately warn children and youth again&s;t taking the &s;malle&s;t property from others. Gro&s;s theft &s;prings from &s;mall beginnings. Tho&s;e who have arrived to the height of this enor|mous vice, began with pilfering &s;mall things. Con&s;cience reproved, but a repetition of the &s;in, hardened the con&s;cience, and they went on to more bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. As the water that finds but a &s;mall opening in the dam, &s;oon wears it away and carries all before it; &s;o this &s;in in|dulged &s;peedily hurries the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or down to ruin. To public &s;hame and untimely death, and to the dreadful wrath of almighty God.</P>
<P>REMEDIES again&s;t temptations to the &s;ins, a|gain&s;t which we are warned by this law, are &s;uch as the following, diligence in profitable and u&s;eful employments, from early life. Idlene&s;s is the nur&s;e of this, and every vice. "Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more: but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth." Some ancient legi&s;latures, obliged parents to have their chil|dren educated, and taught &s;ome u&s;eful mechanic art, to prevent the temptations ari&s;ing from idle|ne&s;s, and to form them to the virtues of hone&s;ty and fidelity in bu&s;ine&s;s. Let temptations to this &s;in be re&s;i&s;ted, by earne&s;t prayer to the author of grace,&mdash;by mortification to the world,&mdash;by the cultivation of a heavenly temper,&mdash;and placing the affections on cele&s;tial riches. "Lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures on earth, where morth &amp;
<PB N="256" REF="028999_0244_0FDDD28DF5C13330">ru&s;t corrupt, and where thieves break thro' and &s;teal; but lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures in hea|ven." Let our minds be filled with a &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of a pre&s;ent God, the witne&s;s and judge of all our ways; and of the &s;upreme tribunal at which we mu&s;t all appear. <HI>And the Lord make you to increa&s;e and abound in love one towards another and towards all men; to the end he may e&s;tabli&s;h your hearts unblameable in holine&s;s, before God, even our father, at the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all his &s;aints.</HI></P>

<P>THIS precept regards principally the peace, &s;atety and happine&s;s of our fellow men, in the pre&s;ervation of their good name. To defame, &s;lander, and fal&s;ely accu&s;e one, are ways mo&s;t ef|fectual to de&s;troy his character and influence, and to wound the heart of an innocent man. Since a per&s;on's peace and u&s;efulne&s;s among men, depend upon the pre&s;ervation of a fair cha|racter, fal&s;ely to accu&s;e or &s;lander him, is doing him an irreparable injury. It is al&s;o an injury to &s;ociety, as it deprives a per&s;on of opportunities and advantages of u&s;efulne&s;s to others. It is a
<PB N="258" REF="028999_0246_0FDDD2958DE27950">crime mo&s;t offen&s;ive to God, who hath mo&s;t &s;olemnly &s;aid, "Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s."</P>
<P>To <HI>witne&s;s,</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give a te&s;timony or declara|tion of the truth of any thing. To bear or give fal&s;e witne&s;s, is to mi&s;repre&s;ent a thing wilfully &amp; knowingly, and with an intention to deceive. The crime is the &s;ame, whether intere&s;t, favor, prejudice or hatred, are the motives. A per&s;on is obliged to &s;peak the truth, even of his greate&s;t enemy. No temptation can ju&s;tify fal&s;ehood.

The reputation and life of a per&s;on would be more un&s;afe, were they to de|pend upon a &s;ingle witne&s;s, by whom truth would be more liable to perver&s;ion, thro' prejudice, mi&s;|conception and the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, than by two or more.

3. THE &s;acred obligations of <HI>truth</HI> in all our con|ver&s;ation and tran&s;actions with men.</P>
<P>THE primary intention of this precept is to prevent the violation of &s;acred truth, e&s;pecially in civil courts; on who&s;e deci&s;ion the intere&s;ts &amp; lives of per&s;ons depend. To the&s;e tribunals, <HI>bearing witne&s;s</HI> particularly re&s;ert. It is witne&s;|&s;ing on oath, to facts, concerning others. Tho&s;e who are e&s;pecially intere&s;ted and cautioned, are the oppo&s;ite parties. It is nece&s;&s;ary, in the adju|dications of cau&s;es in civil courts, and in arbitra|tions of differences between contending parties, that judges and jurors &s;hould be truly and impar|tially informed of the merits of all cau&s;es brought before them for deci&s;ion, that &s;o they may form true judgment. The mo&s;t likely way to obtain this knowledge, is by the &s;olemnity of an oath. In which per&s;ons are adjured as in the pre&s;ence of God, the witne&s;s and judge of thoughts, words and actions, to declare the whole truth. This ordinance, of a &s;olemn oath, is agreeable to the divine will, and the welfare of &s;ociety renders it nece&s;&s;ary. By this act they are brought as into the immediate pre&s;ence of the God of truth, and avenger of perjury, that the mind may be guard|ed again&s;t uttering a fal&s;ehood, or &s;peaking ra&s;h|ly. Such is the good end of bearing witne&s;s on oath. The precept, however, is not confined to <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> only, but is equally a rule and law of con&s;cience, to all concerned. And</P>

2. THAT the advocates for the parties, do not mi&s;repre&s;ent the ca&s;e, or by &s;ophi&s;tical arts hide the truth or blind the court by fal&s;ehood, or dark|en coun&s;el by words without knowledge. It al&s;o requires that judges and jury decide impartially, from the be&s;t light which they can obtain in the ca&s;e, and give true judgment, according to righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, without partiality, bribery or favor, as in the fear of God.</P>
<P>THE nature and obligations of &s;olemn oaths, we have already con&s;idered, under the third pre|cept of the decalogue. <HI>This</HI> condemns fal&s;e oaths or perjury. Perjury is a more heinous crime than lying. Lying is commonly committed without thought of God or accountablene&s;s to him: but in an oath, God is called upon as the witne&s;s and judge of the truth. And the witne&s;s calls upon him&s;elf to &s;peak to God, or as in his pre&s;ence. Perjury is therefore a deliberate &s;in. In addition to the impious guilt of calling upon God to witne&s;s to fal&s;ehood, the crime is great towards men, ina&s;much as an oath is the only &s;ure way of coming at the truth &amp; certainty of things, in many ca&s;es, in which the intere&s;ts and life of individual per&s;ons, are concerned. Perjury de|&s;troys that certainty, and &s;trikes at the foundation of every thing valuable in life. Peculiar wrath awaits this &s;in. Again&s;t it, the divine law points its &s;harpe&s;t arrows. By the laws which the Mo&s;t High gave to the Jews, the perjured per&s;on was condemned to &s;uffer the &s;ame puni&s;hment, which his perjury would have brought upon another. "If a fal&s;e witne&s;s ri&s;e up again&s;t any man, to te&s;tify again&s;t him, that which is wrong; the judg|es &s;hall make diligent inqui&s;ition: and behold, if the witne&s;s, be a fal&s;e witne&s;s, and hath te&s;tified
<PB N="261" REF="028999_0249_0FDDD29F52275AA8">fal&s;ely again&s;t his brother: then &s;hall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done to his bro|ther, &s;o &s;halt thou put away evil from among you. And others &s;hall hear and fear."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deuteronomy</HI> XIX.</NOTE> To &s;uch God hath &s;aid, he will come near to judgment, as one who takes unerring aim at his prey," and I will be a &s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t fal&s;e-&s;weaters, who fear not me, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts. "Perjury is a crime of peculiar aggravation, becau&s;e it is level|led again&s;t both God and man. We come,</P>
<P N="2">2. TO the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e &s;ubordinate crimes, which are violations of this law, as lying, detraction and &s;lander. The&s;e are &s;ins, which altho' they are le&s;s criminal in their nature than perjury, <HI>yet are they</HI> &s;olemnly condemned by the divine law.</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>LIE</HI> is uttering fal&s;ehood, with an inten|tion to deceive. It is a wilful mi&s;repre&s;entation of truth. A declaration by words or actions of a thing, contrary to the mind or intention of him, who makes the declaration. In this fal&s;e com|munication with men, the tongue and the heart, are at variance. To lie to our neighbor, is to do him an injury, proportioned to the magnitude of the object about which he is deceived, and his intere&s;t therein. It may eventually de&s;troy his peace, his property or his life.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on &s;peaks to be believed, he vir|tually promi&s;es to &s;peak the truth. His intention is, that his words &s;hall be received as true; and the hearer has a right to expect the truth. Fal&s;e|hood is then a breach of promi&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS precept al&s;o condemns the violation of a
<PB N="262" REF="028999_0250_0FDDD2A56E561368">promi&s;e. Promi&s;es are &s;acred: To fail of the performance of a promi&s;e, is to be guilty of a &s;pecies of lying. From this guilt the per&s;on is freed, who finds by further knowledge and in|formation, that the promi&s;e was unlawful, which, however, he thought was lawful, at the time. We hence infer the nece&s;&s;ity of due con&s;ideration in promi&s;es. Where a per&s;on is &s;incere in a lawful promi&s;e, and he does all in his power to fulfil it, but by the providence of God, or &s;ome unfore|&s;een occurrences, he is unable to perform; in &s;uch ca&s;e, he is clear of the guilt of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>ONE who conceals or denies the truth, to ex|culpate from blame or to e&s;cape puni&s;hment, is guilty of the &s;in of lying. To re&s;ort to fal&s;ehood, as a &s;ubterfuge from blame, is to increa&s;e the guilt of the offender.
<Q><L>"For he who does one &s;oult at fir&s;t,</L>
<L>"And lies to hide it, makes it two."</L></Q></P>
<P>ALTHOUGH human laws do not oblige an of|fender to accu&s;e or condemp him&s;elf, yet the mo|ral law obliges him not to deny his guilt when ac|cu&s;ed. Sins which are &s;ecret, &amp; by which another is not injured, a per&s;on is not obliged to confe&s;s to men. He may be a true penitent before God, &amp; the world know nothing of his offence. But the ca&s;e is different with one who has injured another. His confe&s;&s;ion to God is his fir&s;t duty, and his &s;a|tisfaction to the per&s;on injured, is in the next place nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT is a vice inherent in the depraved nature of man, to practi&s;e the acts of prevarication &amp; fal&s;e|hood, to &s;hield him&s;elf from blame, for ill doing.
<PB N="263" REF="028999_0251_0FDDD2A6B1D08C58">The tempter of men, who is called emphatically the <HI>father of lies,</HI> early in&s;tilled this principle, in the lap&s;ed parents of the human race. With what violation of truth was not Adam chargeable, when to exculpate him&s;elf, he throw the blame of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion upon the woman; and the woman al&s;o, in ca&s;ting her's upon the &s;erpent? We &s;ee the early buddings of this &s;in, in the arts and &s;tratagems of children, to &s;kreen them&s;elves from blame for evil conduct.</P>
<P>THIS divine law condemns that &s;pecies of lies, which invents fictions and things marvellous, to excite admiration and impo&s;e upon the credu|lous. Per&s;ons of a lively imagination are expo&s;|ed to this temptation. It originates in vanity and pride. It is that fooli&s;h talking which the apo&s;tle condemns, and which tendeth not to edification. Altho' a per&s;on may have no de&s;ign to injure a|nother, by the relation of lying wonders, yet as they are propagated for truths, they are hurtful; becau&s;e they mi&s;lead the credulous, and confound the difference between truth and fal&s;ehood. For every idle word men mu&s;t give account to God, who&s;e laws demand truth in all our conver&s;ation, and awfully condemn tho&s;e who deal fal&s;ely, ei|ther in word or conduct.</P>
<P N="3">3. Di&s;&s;imulation and hypocri&s;y are violations of this divine precept. Di&s;&s;imulation is com|monly under&s;tood as an attempt to deceive others, with fal&s;e appearances in the affairs of life; hy|pocri&s;y is pructi&s;ing the &s;ame art, in religious concerns. One expre&s;&s;es a regard for others, which the actor has not; the other, that regard for religion, which is de&s;titute of &s;incerity. They wear the appearances of what they are not, and
<PB N="264" REF="028999_0252_0FDDD2A83A7E6D20">are an odious &s;pecies of lying. Hypocri&s;y, &s;ig|nifies going beyond the mark, or pretending to more than is real. The&s;e vices are commonly put on to &s;erve a purpo&s;e, and are painful to the ac|tors. The di&s;&s;embler and the hypocrite labor to conceal them&s;elves behind a ma&s;k. The effort be|ing unnatural, di&s;covery and &s;hame mun be the final i&s;&s;ue. Nature will peep out at unguarded moments; and when re&s;traints and temptations are removed, the ma&s;k will be thrown a&s;ide. Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription would &s;ave them&s;elves a world of labor, were they &s;uch in reality, as they wi&s;h to appear to be. To him who is &s;in|cere towards his God and his fellow men, the ap|pearance of his &s;incerity will be natural, and &s;pon|taneous; but without the reality, it is difficult to maintain the appearance of virtue. To put on the &s;emblance of goodne&s;s, to gain e&s;teem with men, &s;hews that there is &s;omething in teal good|ne&s;s, which commands our approbation. And if the appearance is good, much more &s;o is the re|ality. The vicious pay an involuntary reverence to per&s;ons of religious characters. The loveline&s;s virtue commands their veneration. The be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way to appear to be virtuous, is to be real|ly virtuous.</P>
<P>HYPOCRISY and di&s;&s;imulation, wander in artful ways, and thro' much perplexity &s;ometimes ac|compli&s;h their purpo&s;es: but virtue and &s;inceri|ty pur&s;ue their object in the &s;traight road, and will finally pro&s;per: for "truth is mighty and will prevail." Should the deceiver for a while &s;ucceed, in the practice of impo&s;ition upon men, yet he cannot deceive God, who&s;e omni&s;cient eye pervades the darkne&s;s and the thicke&s;t veil, and who requires truth and &s;incerity of heart in all
<PB N="265" REF="028999_0253_0FDDD2AF1847E588">our profe&s;&s;ions of him, and in all our conver&s;a|tion with men He will gloriou&s;ly reward the lovers of &s;incere truth and goodne&s;s, and &s;everely puni&s;h all hypocritical di&s;&s;emblers.</P>
<P N="4">4. ALL malicious lies invented or propogated to the prejudice of others, are utterly condemned by this law. This is to bear fal&s;e witne&s;s before the world, again&s;t our neighbor; and is a crime hateful to God and nijurious to men. Before I proceed to the particular con&s;ideration of the vices of &s;lander and detraction, comprehended in this article, allow me to take notice of the evil nature and ruinous effects of fal&s;ehood in general.</P>
<P N="1">1. A DISPOSITION to utter fal&s;ehood or lies, is a proof of a vicious heart. Per&s;ons given to this odious habit are de&s;titute of any good principle of action. They have lo&s;t the moral &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, and the wide difference of truth and fal&s;ehood. They &s;hew that they have no proper regard for their own intere&s;t or happine&s;s, or of their fellow men, and that they have wholly ca&s;t off a &s;uitable fear of God. The &s;hameful and hurtful nature of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vice, proves the great de|pravity of its &s;ource. From the vicious heart proceed evil thoughts, and every degree of fal&s;e-hood. In the heart of Judas, lying dwelt, as inits proper habitation. He pretended to be grieved for what he called the wall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ointment; (the gratful tribute of a &s;incere penitent to her com|pa&s;&s;ionate &s;aviour) but his declaration was a fal&s;e-hood to conceal his fraudulent intention. The &s;ame principle which inclines a per&s;on to utter fal&s;ehood, and to cheat and deceive by lies, will al&s;o induce him to cheat others of property, when
<PB N="266" REF="028999_0254_0FDDD2B074537260">opportunities pre&s;ent. The liar is therefore di&s;|hone&s;t, and is not to be intru&s;ted with the goods of others. The&s;e vices u&s;ually meet in the &s;ame per&s;on. The precept forbidding theft, preceeds that which forbids fal&s;ehood: For theft is com|monly followed by the &s;in of lying.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE evil and guilt of lying appears from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ob&s;ervance of truth, to the happine&s;s and exi&s;tance of mankind; and al&s;o from the dreadful con&s;equences which would fol|low, &s;hould fal&s;ehood and lies become an univer|fal practice. Without the ob&s;ervance of &s;acred truth, mankind could have no confidence in each other&punc; words, tho&s;e images of the thoughts, would he of no u&s;e. No contracts, promi&s;es or &s;olemn covenants, would bind men. Univer&s;al di&s;tru&s;t would take place, &s;ocial union be di&s;&s;olved, and peace bani&s;hed from the earth. Such are the rui|nous effects of fal&s;ehood, that all men dete&s;t a liar. For he is the enemy of mankind. Other vices are kept in countenance, by finding guilty companions, who practi&s;e and applaud them: but the mo&s;t vicious dete&s;t the liar. The mo&s;t aban|doned clubs expect and demand truth from each other, after they have ca&s;t off every other virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE vice of lying is puni&s;hed in a degree, in this life. The liar lo&s;es the confidence of all who know him. He is de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;huned, and labors under the great inconvenience of not being believed when he &s;peaks the truth. And as by lies he attempts to deceive others, the evil is re|torted upon him, by a di&s;belief of truths, which he may utter. Thus lying is a vice, rewarded with univer&s;al hatred. A heathen poet could &s;ay,
<PB N="267" REF="028999_0255_0FDDD1AABB86C8E8">
<Q><L>"He who'll think one thing, and another tell,</L>
<L>"My &s;oul dete&s;ts him, as the gates of hell."</L></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. AGAINST tho&s;e who practi&s;e this &s;hameful &s;in, the wrath of almighty God, is al&s;o proclaim|ed. Liars are cla&s;&s;ed among the greate&s;t offen|ders; and the &s;evere&s;t doom awaits them. They are excluded the pure abodes of ju&s;t men, and &s;ent to a&s;&s;ociate with the father of lies. "All liars &s;hall have their part in the lake which burn|eth with fire and brim&s;tone." Into the new Je|ru&s;alem, "there &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter any thing that defileth, neither what&s;oever worketh abomi|nation, or maketh a lie,&mdash;For without are dogs (the contentious and unclean) and &s;orcerers, and what&s;oever loveth and maketh a lie."</P>
<P>DETRACTION and &s;lander fall under the con|demnation of the &s;in of bearing fal&s;e witne&s;s. They are a &s;pecies of lying and full of hatred a|gain&s;t our neighbor. Detraction is a vice, which depreciates another's merit. Which does not al|low him the good properties which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and which aggravates his failings. It is the off|&s;pring of envy and hatred. Slander is the in|vention or propagation of fal&s;e reports, to the in|jury of anothers good name. The&s;e are vices condemned by the moral and evangelic law, and are directly oppo&s;ed to that charity and benevo|lence, which mankind ought to exerci&s;e, one to|wards another. The&s;e vices are denominated in the &s;acred writings, by the odious names of back|biting, tale-bearing; and the propagaters of them, bu&s;y bodies. They are blinded to their own fail|ings, but watchful to &s;py the failings of others. They di&s;cern a mote in their neighbor's eye, while they perceive not a beam in their own eye. They
<PB N="268" REF="028999_0256_0FDDD2B852B853F0">put the mo&s;t favorable con&s;truction upon their own faults, and aggravate and blaze abroad the faults of others. Per&s;ons of this character are envious and cruel in their di&s;po&s;itions. De&s;titute of merit them&s;elves, it grieves them to &s;ee others po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Their torment increa&s;es in proportion to the increa&s;e of their neighbor's pro&s;perity. The gall of hatred is &s;pit from their invenomed tongues, to poi&s;on the character of others. They are like the &s;piteful a&s;p, who torments him&s;elf by gnawing, with bloody jaws, upon the impeneta|ble file. It is &s;urely a mo&s;t uncomfortable and hateful temper. It is to act the part of him, who is emphatically the accu&s;er and de&s;troyer of men.</P>
<P>A GOOD name is a mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is what every one wi&s;hes and labors to e&s;tabli&s;h, by meretorious conduct. It is the virtuous poor man's only inheritance here, and the valuable le|gacy which he leaves to his children. It is a trea&s;ure, which the owner would not part with for any earthly reward, becau&s;e upon it depends his peace of mind, his credit and u&s;efulne&s;s on earth. To injure a per&s;ons character is an exten|&s;ive and irreparable injury. It is an act of rob|bery; and the guilt is increa&s;ed, by the con&s;ide|ration, that the robbery does not enrich the &s;lan|derer. He &s;ays one,
<Q><L>"Who &s;teals from me my pur&s;e, takes tra&s;h,</L>
<L>"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been &s;lave to thou&s;ands;</L>
<L>"But he who 'robs' me of my good name</L>
<L>"Robs me of that which not enriches him,</L>
<L>"And makes me poor indeed."</L></Q></P>
<P>To propagate unfavorable reports of others un|nece&s;&s;arily,
<PB N="269" REF="028999_0257_0FDDD2B975276048">even on the &s;uppo&s;ition of their guilt, is a violation of this law. To "&s;peak evil of no man," is an excellent rule of government of the tongue. We ought to conceal the faults of our neighbors, unle&s;s the good of others, or of &s;ocie|ty, makes it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould witne&s;s a|gain&s;t them. And when that nece&s;&s;ity happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, the benevolent per&s;on, will not &s;peak with plea|&s;ure, but with pain of the faults of others. Some|times the reformation of the offender, renders it nece&s;&s;ary that his faults &s;hould be expo&s;ed to public view, that being reproved before all, he may be a&s;hamed, and repent. But the amiable temper of religion will teach us to do this, with a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and love, to the offender. To rai&s;e fal&s;e reports of another, and propagate them is a far greater &s;in than &s;preading abroad tho&s;e, which are true concerning him. It is adding the &s;in of lying, to calumny. It is to do the greate&s;t injury to an innocent per&s;on. To de&s;ame a per|&s;on in his ab&s;ence, is to act the part of the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in, who &s;tabs in the dark, and behind the back. Per&s;ons al&s;o are chargeable with the guilt of this &s;in, who willingly hear the character of others a&s;|per&s;ed; and who do not vindicate the ab&s;ent in|nocent per&s;on, and frown upon the &s;landerer. To &s;lander one to his face, is al&s;o a great indignity, e&s;pecially when done in the intoxication of an|ger. He who be&s;tows prai&s;e upon one for well doing, confers a de&s;erved reward: but he who detracts from another's merit, is guilty of fal&s;e|hood and robbery. Dealers in &s;candal are com|monly the mo&s;t unworthy characters. He wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> knows the value of a fair reputation, will gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> again&s;t this &s;in.

<P>IN the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e was &s;hewn the cri|minal nature, and hurtful con&s;equences of the &s;ins prohibited, by this divine precept. What it condemns, is &s;ummarily comprized in the vices &amp; crimes of perjury, lying, detraction and &s;lander. I &s;hall now point out the po&s;itive duties and vir|tues which it demands. The&s;e are all contained in the &s;acred obligations of <HI>truth,</HI> in all our con|ver&s;ation with mankind. As this law condemns all fal&s;ehood and di&s;&s;imulation, it forcibly de|mands the univer&s;al practice of truth and &s;ince|rity.</P>
<P N="1">1. MANKIND are &s;acredly obliged to &s;peak the truth to, and of each other. The rea&s;on of this
<PB N="272" REF="028999_0260_0FDDD2BCBA894E48">appears, in that the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of man|kind, depend upon the confidence which they re|po&s;e in each other's words and promi&s;es. The chri&s;tian religion forcibly inculcates this du|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the moral law. "Wherefore laying a&s;ide all evil &s;peaking, &s;peak truth every man with his neighbor. Speak not evil one of another. What|&s;oever things are true,&mdash;think on the&s;e things."</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are bound to adhere to the truth, when called to &s;peak of the character of our neighbor, and in our vindication of him. We are com|manded not to hate our brother in our heart; but to love him as our&s;elves. This love is &s;hewn, by giving him all &s;uitable re&s;pect for his virtuous and u&s;eful deeds, and in vindicating his good name from reproach.</P>
<P>A GREAT incitement to calumniators, to propa|gate evil reports of others, is the patience and willingne&s;s with which per&s;ons li&s;ten to &s;lander|ous reports. This di&s;po&s;ition, too natural, alas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the depraved heart, ari&s;es from a wi&s;h to pull down others, to a level with them&s;elves, and to have them&s;elves held in greater e&s;teem. But the per&s;on who fears and loves God, knows his own many failings, and will not take plea&s;ure in the failings of others, nor in fal&s;e and &s;u&s;picious re|ports concerning them. The generous and pious per&s;on will frown upon the take-bearer. "As the north wind driveth away rain, &s;o doth an angry countenance a back-biting tongue." A good man, will be &s;low to believe unfavorable reports of his neighbor. He will rejoice to hear him well &s;po|ken of; he will grieve to hear any thing to his di&s;advantage. He will put the mo&s;t favorable con|&s;truction on his words and conduct. He will not
<PB N="273" REF="028999_0261_0FDDD2B205A1AA68">exaggerate his faults; "for charity is kind, and thinketh no evil, but rejoiceth in the truth." If we cannot &s;peak in commendation of another, it is a good rule to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS law obliges us to bury in oblivion the &s;ins of others, after they have repented of them, and made &s;atisfaction. Their faults &s;hould be forgotten, as tho' they had never been. The di|vine mercy towards us, teaches us &s;o to do, to|wards our fellow men. God is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed on our repentance, to pardon and blot out our &s;ins. He will not &s;uffer them to ri&s;e to &s;hame or condemn us. They are &s;aid to be ca&s;t behind the back, and buried in the depths of the &s;ea. And "except ye in like manner forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your father in heaven forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." If our gracious Lord thus freely forgives us, the debt of ten thou&s;and talents, &s;hall we be unforgiving to our fellow offenders? The for|givene&s;s of injuries from the beart, is that amia|ble temper which the go&s;pel breathes, and that charity which hides a multitude of faults.</P>
<P>WE are obliged to &s;hew our regard to truth, and to our offending neighbor, by &s;uitable endea|vors, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and love, to reclaim him. Thus to deal with an offender is the mo&s;t likely way to bring him to con&s;ideration, and re|pentance; and thus to &s;ave him from the condem|nation of his &s;in. In this way a per&s;on may be mo&s;t &s;erviceable to another, in the concerns of his be&s;t intere&s;ts, and his temporal and eternal happine&s;s. For "he who converteth one from the error of his way, &s;hall &s;ave a &s;oul from death, and hide a multitude of &s;ins."</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS law obliges us to &s;hun pa&s;&s;ing a &s;evere
<PB N="274" REF="028999_0262_0FDDD1B0624D9DC0">judgment upon others, or ra&s;hly condemning any. "Judge not that ye be not judged. Judge no|thing before the time." No per&s;on can be law|fully judged or condemned, without clear evi|dence of guilt. When guilt is evident, and the glory of God and the good of others make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that we expo&s;e his &s;ins, a &s;acred regard to truth obliges us on the one hand, not to en|large upon his faults and crimes, and on the other, not to hide them. We are not to &s;uffer &s;in upon a brother; but our motives in reproving or con|demning him, &s;hould be pure, and the nece&s;&s;ity e|vident. Remembering that we al&s;o are in the body, and that we are chargeable with faults and crimes, again&s;t God and men, for which we need forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS precept obliges us to &s;hew kindne&s;s to all men, and that we take no plea&s;ure in the in|firmities and failings of any. To make others the &s;ubject of ridicule and contempt, on account of any natural infirmity, either mental or bodily, which they may labor under; is cruel and impi|ous. It is an injury to the per&s;on, becau&s;e it is not in his power to remedy the defect; it is impi|ous, as it is a reflection on the creator. "Who maketh thee to differ from another, and what ha&s;t thou, that thou has not received?" The profane youth of Bethel once ridiculed the holy prophet Elijah, on account of this baldne&s;s; and the Mo&s;t High re&s;ented the indignity, and bea&s;ts of prey were commi&s;&s;ioned to tear them in pieces.</P>
<P N="6">6. TRUTH and ju&s;tice al&s;o require that we vin|dicate our own reputation from detraction and &s;lander. A fair character is a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion next in value to life it&s;elf. It is every per&s;on's duty to
<PB N="275" REF="028999_0263_0FDDD1B1A3010388">obtain and po&s;&s;e&s;s this trea&s;ure. It is acquired by a uniform life of virtue; by the &s;acred ob|&s;ervance of truth and &s;incerity; and per&s;ever|ance in benevolent and u&s;eful deeds towards men, and piety towards God.</P>
<P>HE will po&s;&s;e&s;s this trea&s;ure, more precious than rubies, who "&s;peaks the truth in his heart: who does to others, as he would that others &s;hould do to him: who does ju&s;tly, loves mercy, and humbly walks with God."</P>
<P>THERE is among mankind &s;uch a re&s;pect for a truly virtuous character, that altho' &s;ome worth|le&s;s per&s;ons may envy, and others defame, yet the man who is uniformly good, will be e&s;teemed and re&s;pected. While the vicious and profane hate his virtues, they reverence his principles of action. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, every man may attain to a fair reputation. It depends not on greatne&s;s of genius, or learning, or wealth or worldly di&s;tinctions; but on integrity and bene|volence towards men, and piety towards God. The mo&s;t virtuous characters are &s;ometimes found, among the poor of this world, and oftener than a|mong the rich. Poverty is more friendly to vir|tue than opulence. Many of the ancient &s;aints, of whom the world was not worthy, were poor. They were de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented. They took patiently the &s;poiling of their goods, know|ing that in heaven they had enduring &s;ub&s;tance. The only perfect pattern of goodne&s;s, that ever ble&s;&s;ed the dwellings of men, and in whom the perfection of every virtue dwelt, was poor. He voluntarily cho&s;e the condition of virtuous pover|ty. "The &s;on of man had not where to lay his head." Je&s;us is the rich and the poor man's pat|tern,
<PB N="276" REF="028999_0264_0FDDD1B31F714D18">in every amiable and u&s;eful accompli&s;h|ment. His followers, tho' poor in this world, if rich in faith, and the chri&s;tian virtues, are heirs to a kingdom, glorious and unfading. They are ble&s;&s;ed who imitate him; who have the &s;ame mind in them, which was al&s;o in him. Who walk as he walked in truth and &s;incerity, and in all the duties of righteous and piety. Per&s;ons of this character will be re&s;pected and loved, by wi&s;e and good men, and reverenced by the wick|ed, whatever their worldly condition may be.
<Q><L>"Honor and &s;hame from no condition file,</L>
<L>"Act well your part, there all the honor lies."</L></Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the virtuous poor may be hidden from the ob&s;ervation of the world, they are &s;een by that omni&s;cient judge who approves and will re|ward them openly. It is the duty of a good man, by ju&s;t and lawful means to defend and vindicate his reputation, from fal&s;ehood and &s;lander. A &s;acred adherence to truth, is as nece&s;&s;ary in the vindication of his own as of his neighbor's cha|racter. Saint Paul, when fal&s;ely accu&s;ed of the Jews, defended him&s;elf before king Agrippa. "I think my&s;elf happy, king Agrippa, that I may an|&s;wer for my&s;elf, touching the things, whereof I am accu&s;ed of the Jews." And his vindication terminated in his honor, and the confu&s;ion of his accu&s;ers. And when his enemies at Corinth, labored to le&s;&s;en him in the e&s;teem of his brethren there, as a per&s;on of inferior accompli&s;hments; he mode&s;tly commends him&s;elf; but laments that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k. "I am become a fool in glorying but ye have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing am I behind the very chiefe&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="028999_0265_0FDDD1B48946C180">apo&s;tles, tho' I be nothing. But by the grace of God I am what I am."</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it be a &s;mall matter to a virtuous man, to be judged by a cen&s;orious world, yet does his duty to God, and ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, render the vindication of him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the honor of God and of religion, is connected with the unblameable lives of the profe&s;&s;ors of godli|ne&s;s, and becau&s;e a fair character is nece&s;&s;ary to their u&s;efulne&s;s. And that others &s;eeing their good works may glorify their father in heaven. By the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a good name, by worthy deeds, the &s;phere of a man's u&s;efulne&s;s is enlarg|ed, and mankind benefited by his good works and good example.</P>
<P>THUS are per&s;ons obliged to guard again&s;t e|very thing which brings a ju&s;t reproach on their character,&mdash;to be very tender of the reputation of others,&mdash;zealou&s;ly defending the injured,&mdash; frowning upon the &s;landerer, and tho&s;e who are plea&s;ed with malicious reports, and when injured them&s;elves, to u&s;e all &s;uitable means in their own vindication.</P>
<P>LET me add, that it is &s;inful for a per&s;on to bear fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t him&s;elf. This per&s;ons may do, by accu&s;ing them&s;elves of things of which they are not guilty, and by needle&s;sly expo&s;ing their own &s;ecret faults and infirmities, which do not concern their fellow men.</P>
<P N="7">7. THIS precept obliges men to perform all lawful promi&s;es. As men place dependence on the promi&s;es of each other, the nonperformance, is an injury to the party, and a violation of truth.
<PB N="278" REF="028999_0266_0FDDD1B978EEBCD0">They &s;hould no more be broken, than oaths and written contracts. A con&s;cientious per&s;on will perform his promi&s;e, tho' it be to his hurt. The virtuous and generous man will not however, ex|act the fulfilment of a promi&s;e, when it cannot be done without great detriment to the promi&s;er, and e&s;pecially when the good promi&s;ed or an e|quivalent, is not attainable.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome things indifferent in their na|ture, in which a promi&s;e may be made, or pur|po&s;e intended, and in which others cannot be in|jured, by withholding or varying the perform|ance. There are al&s;o conditional promi&s;es be|tween men, in which the performance of the con|dition, by the one party, binds the other to per|form the promi&s;e. And on the other hand, the failure of the condition, liberates the promi&s;er from the obligation of his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is the character of a good man, that tho' he promi&s;es to his hurt, he will perform his promi&s;e. Tho' temptations to violate a promi&s;e, made to one's detriment, are powerful to plead in excu&s;e, for a failure in performance, no temptations, how|ever, can ju&s;tify a failure in things lawfully pro|mi&s;ed. For every failure is a violation of truth.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal in&s;tances, recorded in the &s;acred writings, of virtuous and pious per&s;ons, uttering fal&s;ehood, and practi&s;ing the arts of di&s;&s;i|mulation. The&s;e in&s;tances &s;hew the imperfection of human virtue, amid&s;t the darkne&s;s and tempta|tions of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of guilt and depravity. They are recorded, not for our imitation but for our warning. The &s;acred volume begins, with an account of the fal&s;ehood of the original pa|rents
<PB N="279" REF="028999_0267_0FDDD1BB4FF4DE90">of the human race, immediately on their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; tempted thereto by the malicious arts of the father of lies, who was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.</P>
<P>THE in&s;pired writers of the &s;acred &s;criptures, have recorded the faults and crimes of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons, and their own. This is a proof of great hone&s;ty and impartiality, in tho&s;e wri|ters, and that they were guided in what they wrote, by the divine &s;pirit. They give glory to God, who pardons the &s;ins of his people, and con|fe&s;s their own guilt, that the riches of grace in their forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s, may be magnified. From the charge of fal&s;ehood, the great and good charac|ter of the patriarch Abraham, is not wholly ex|empted. Thro' fear of death in Egypt, on ac|count of his amiable Sarah, he denied her to be his wife, and called her his &s;i&s;ter. The like fault we find in his &s;on I&s;aac. The &s;tratagem of Jacob and his mother Rebecca, to circumvent E&s;au and deceive the aged parent, is a complication of fal&s;ehood. God overruled their conduct therein, to accompli&s;h his own divine purpo&s;es, towards their de&s;cendants. Although God had d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">reed the ble&s;&s;ing to Jacob, yet this did not exculpate him, in the u&s;e of unlawful means to obtain it. The midwives of Egypt, to &s;ave the lives of the male children of I&s;rael, made a fal&s;e report to the king. God ble&s;&s;ed and built up their families, not becau&s;e they had &s;poken fal&s;ely, but for their kindne&s;s to his people. The penitent Rahab of Jericho, who had been an harlot, but who obtaine the grace of forgivene&s;s, is ranked by the apo&s;tle, among the worthies who died in faith. She was guilty of fal&s;ehood, in her attempt to conceal the &s;pies, who fled to her hou&s;e for protection. She
<PB N="280" REF="028999_0268_0FDDD1BCD0F6ED10">is commended for her faith and for receiving the &s;pies; but not for her fal&s;chood, in concealing them. Sam&s;on, another of the ancient worthies, was guilty of fal&s;ehood in an&s;wer to the inqui|ries of his enemies, into the cau&s;e of his great &s;trength. The emba&s;&s;adors of Gibeon, who &s;u|ed for peace, were chargeable with great di&s;&s;imu|lation. To pre&s;erve life, they were tempted to utter fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>WE di&s;cover fal&s;ehood in Jonathan, the amia|ble friend of the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, when his father Saul &s;ought his life. Jonathan excu&s;ed his ab|&s;ence by a fal&s;ehood. The like di&s;&s;imulation and fal&s;ehood we al&s;o find in David, when he fled for his life to Ahimeleck the prie&s;t, and to Achi&s;h king of Gath.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tances of fal&s;chood in good men, re|corded in the bible, were principally in ca&s;es in which life was in danger, and the fear of death over came for a time, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the &s;acred ob|ligations of truth. Some of them afterwards &s;uffered for their falschood, and all repented of the &s;in.</P>
<P>SOME reflections will conclude this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. LET us habitually cultivate in our hearts a principle of love and loyalty to God, as the mo&s;t efficacious motive to the &s;acred ob&s;ervance of truth, and &s;incerity, in all our conver&s;ation with mankind. "Thou, O Lord, de&s;ire&s;t truth in the inner parts. The eyes of the Lord are upon the truth. "Impre&s;&s;ed with a lively &s;en&s;e of the divine omni&s;cience, we &s;hall do no inju&s;tice knowingly to men. Let us not violate &s;acred
<PB N="281" REF="028999_0269_0FDDD1BE4ABF6760">truth, though tempted by the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;|pects of wealth, honor or life. For he who a|po&s;tatizes from truth and a good con&s;cience, to &s;ave life, &s;hall lo&s;e it. Let it be the rule &amp; mea|&s;ure of all our words and actions. Let a con&s;i|deration of the odious nature, and hurtful effects of fal&s;ehood, guard us from this &s;in, and excite to a watchfulne&s;s over the thoughts, that we of|fend not with our tongue.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE impre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s and charity towards our fellow men, will re&s;train the tongue from injury. When duty calls to &s;peak of the ill deeds of others, or to hear them &s;poken of, let us con&s;ider what we &s;hould rea&s;onably wi&s;h, were we in their condition; and practi&s;e upon that ju&s;t and benevolent rule of religion, "as ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them." Let not prejudice, fear or partiality, tempt us, at any time, to deviate from the line of truth and rectitude. Let us ever di&s;counten|ance the vice of &s;lander, and &s;top our ears to the language of detraction; and avoid the company of tho&s;e, who propagate idle tales, to the preju|dice of their neighbor. If any have been guilty of this heinous offence, let them &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the injury, which they have done to others. If by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the father of lies, and the depravity of their own hearts, any have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai&s;ed groundle&s;s reports again&s;t their neighbor, &s;et them take all &s;nitable methods to repair the injury. Let them follow the &s;candal, which they have pro|pagated, through all its windings, and un&s;ay and contradict it, and make reparation. Let the of|fender look forward to that &s;olemn day, when for every idle &amp; fal&s;e word, he mu&s;t give account to God.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="028999_0270_0FDDD1C46CD06980">
As motives preventive of this vice, let me men|tion, 1. That &s;lander is the way to widen the breach of friend&s;hip between men, and increa&s;e contention. "A tale bearer &s;eparateth chiefe&s;t friends." A &s;incere regard for an offending bro|ther will di&s;po&s;e us, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, to endeavour to reform him from his faults; but &s;lander tends to create them. It excites the re|&s;entment and hatred of both the injured, and the offender.</P>
<P>GIVE prai&s;e where it is due; and be as ready to commend another, for his good deeds, as to cen&s;ure him, for tho&s;e which are evil. If the per|&s;on is guilty of the &s;in, of which you accu&s;e him, remember that you al&s;o are an offender: that you have &s;ins lying upon your con&s;cience, perhaps un|repented of, greater than tho&s;e, for which you condemn him. Do you not need mercy and for|givene&s;s from God, as well as your offending brother? And can you per&s;wade your&s;elf, that your offences are le&s;s than his, becau&s;e they are yours? If the &s;in which you charge upon another, is fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, your &s;in is the greater, be|cau&s;e you condemn the innocent.</P>
<P>LET us guard again&s;t that fooli&s;h talking, which &s;ports with the reputation and happine&s;s of others. He who &s;o does, is compared to a mad|man, who ca&s;ts abroad fire-brands, arrows and death. Tho' it is mirth to the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">er, it is the occa&s;ion of grief to the injured. To guard again&s;t the evils condemned by this law, we are to prac|ti&s;e that &s;incerity, openne&s;s and integrity, which is oppo&s;ed to guile, hypocri&s;y and fal&s;ehood. What a worthy commendation does Je&s;us give, of one of his di&s;ciples, "behold an I&s;raelite in|deed,
<PB N="283" REF="028999_0271_0FDDD1C5C2C69628">in whom is no guile." Let us &s;trive, &s;irs, to obtain this worthine&s;s of character.</P>
<P>IF you have de&s;erved reproach, receive and im|prove it as an admonition to repent and reform; and go and &s;in no more. Thus you will make an enemy, the in&s;trument of your &s;piritual advantage and &s;alvation. If you are innocent, pity the offen|der, and let the reproach &s;erve as a guard again&s;t all ju&s;t occa&s;ions of offence.</P>
<P>IF you &s;uffer reproach for doing your duty to God and mankind, dare to be &s;ingular in your adherence to the cau&s;e of religion, and in the mid&s;t of mockery and per&s;ecution, meekly bear the &s;hame. Let your example be the meek and patient Je&s;us, "who when he was reviled, revil|ed not again, when he &s;uffered he threatened not." His &s;uffering followers, he will reward with eter|nal honors. "Ca&s;t not away your confidence in him, for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promi&s;e." If you meet with oppo&s;ition from this quarter in the progre&s;s of your &s;alvation, meet it with fortitude; humbly depending on the grace of Chri&s;t, who for us, &s;uffered without the gate; And go forth, therefore, unto him without the camp, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earing his reproach."</P>
<P>OUR Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is called the faithful and the true witne&s;s, becau&s;e he declared to men the coun&s;el of God, and made known all things nece&s;&s;ary to our faith and practice, with plainne&s;s, faithfulne&s;s and truth. In him was no guile. He witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;ion before Pontius Pilate, &s;aying, "To this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e, came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear

From his ble&s;&s;ed king|dom of truth and holine&s;s, "who&s;oever loveth and maketh a lie," will be forever excluded.</P>
<P>AWFUL will be the final doom of fal&s;e-&s;wear|ers, liars and the perjured. They will be con|demned to the lake of fire and brimdone, kind|led by the breath of incen&s;ed ju&s;tice. But the everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and glories of heaven, will be given to him that &s;peaketh the truth in his heart, who loves God with all the heart, and his neighbor as him&s;elf, and is true and faithful to men. "Lord, who &s;hall abide in thy tabernacle? Who &s;hall dwell in thy holy hill? He that walk|eth uprightly, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;peaketh the truth in his heart."</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Precept tenth.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>EXODUS XX, 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thou &s;halt not covet thy neighbor's hou&s;e, thou &s;halt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man &s;ervant, nor his maid &s;ervant, nor his ox, nor his a&s;s, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t precept of the moral law. The four preceeding, re&s;pect the life, the cha&s;tity, the property and the reputation of our fellow men. There is a &s;triking gradation in the arrangement of the duties and virtues of this &s;econd table of the law. The greater crimes are fir&s;t prohibited, and the obligation of the higher duties implied. And the prohibition of the&s;e crimes, and the obligati|ons of the oppo&s;ite duties and virtues, are wi&s;ely laid on the foundation of &s;ilial obedience; which is the fir&s;t law of duty towards mankind. For the virtue of filial piety, prepares the &s;ubject for the faithful performance of all &s;ocial and relative duties. This tenth and la&s;t precept is added as an appendix to the whole, and is a key to open and explain the &s;pirituality, the latitude and extent of the other precepts of this univer&s;al law. "Thou &s;halt not <HI>covet,</HI> any thing that is thy neighbor's." This precept relates immediately to the heart, and &s;hews that this, and all the re&s;t, are &s;piritual as well as external. It &s;trikes at the root of all evil in conduct towards our fellow men; for all evil originates in a &s;elfi&s;h and covetous principle, che|ci&s;hed in the heart. We are hence taught the
<PB N="286" REF="028999_0274_0FDDD1CFC8126BE8">&s;pirituality, and perfection of the moral law. That it re&s;pects the &s;tate of the mind; the government of the pa&s;&s;ions and affections, and all the faculties and exerci&s;es of the heart, as well as the external con|ver&s;ation. Our text confirms the declaration of the Apo&s;tle, "The law is &s;piritual." And al&s;o of the p&s;almi&s;t, "Thy commandment is exceed|ing broad."</P>
<P>To look back to the precepts of this &s;econd ta|ble, we find, the fifth teaches us, very comprehen|&s;ively, the duties which we owe to &s;uperiors and inferiors; the remaining precepts, our obligati|ons to our equals; the &s;ixth, in the pre&s;ervation of his per&s;on and life; the &s;eventh, his innocency and cha&s;tity; the eighth, his property; the ninth, his reputation. And &s;ince all evil conduct to|wards men, proceeds from a depraved nature, this la&s;t precept gives a rule of government to the heart, forbidding every lu&s;tful or coveting emoti|on towards the goods, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and enjoyments of others, and demanding univer&s;al good will to men, and contentment with our own condition. Thus every degree of injurious conduct towards others, is de&s;troyed at its &s;ource; the fountain is healed, that good and beneficent actions may un|interruptedly flow to men.</P>
<P>THIS precept is added to &s;hew us, that God's law mu&s;t be impre&s;&s;ed upon the heart, would we acceptably keep his commandments.

FOR the mi&s;eries which mankind bring upon them&s;elves and on others, by the crimes of inju&s;|tice, and unmercifulne&s;s; the inva&s;ion of &s;ocial and civil rights, intemperance, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, con|tentions, robbery and war; and the bani&s;hment of the benevolent affections from the human heart, may all be traced to the &s;in of <HI>coveting,</HI> or eagerly thir&s;ting after the goods and enjoyments of this life. Tho' the text condemns coveting any thing that is our neighbor's, it does not con|demn lawfully de&s;iring, or endeavors to obtain, &s;ome things which are the property of others. Mankind are placed in a condition of mutual de|pendance, for many things nece&s;&s;ary to life and happine&s;s. This dependence is the &s;pring of all in|du&s;try and exertion, in every occupation. We lawfully &s;trive to obtain by purcha&s;e, the goods which others po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which we need. What is condemned, is the de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e goods of others, which we cannot lawfully po&s;&s;e&s;s; and which others cannot part with, without injury to them&s;elves. The crime forbidden, appears in &s;triking colors, in a &s;elfi&s;h Ahab, coveting the vineyard of Naboth.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kings</HI> 21.</NOTE> The latter refu&s;ed to part with &s;o valuable a patrimony, the inheritance of his ance&s;tors. But the avaricious monarch, in&s;tigated by the criminal pa&s;&s;ion of covetou&s;ne&s;s, devi&s;ed means to accompli&s;h the death of an in|nocent man, and by force &s;eized the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his neighbour. For this crime, a prophet was divinely commi&s;&s;ioned, to pronounce upon him, an untimely death, and the wrath of God.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> principle is the &s;ource of covetous de|&s;ires. A covetous man views him&s;elf, as the on|ly object in the univer&s;e, who&s;e wi&s;hes are to be
<PB N="289" REF="028999_0277_0FDDD1D7D9784F38">gratified. His &s;oul is contracted and draws all things to it&s;elf. It is a &s;tranger to benevolence, and the tenderne&s;s of &s;ympathy. To correct and eradicate &s;o mean a principle, let the &s;ubject &s;trive to con&s;ider him&s;elf, but as a poor helple&s;s indivi|dual, in the great family of mankind. Let him place him&s;elf, as in the pre&s;ence of his creator, and a&s;k him&s;elf, in what light he appears in the view of the univer&s;al pre&s;erver and judge of his creatures; and whether he has a right to claim greater favors, than myriads of his fellow men? A &s;light di&s;covery of his helple&s;s and dependent condition, and his unworthine&s;s of the lea&s;t of the divine mercies, would re&s;train tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h and unrea&s;onable de&s;ires, which gra&s;p after the goods of others. But this view of him&s;elf, the covetous mortal has not. He imagines the world made for his u&s;e, and &s;trives to ri&s;e on the ruin of others. He cares not who &s;inks into poverty and wretch|edne&s;s, provided he may &s;wim in wealth; nor by what means he gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the goods of o|thers. Covetou&s;ne&s;s is a criminal pa&s;&s;ion,</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE its tendency is de&s;tructive to the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of others. It di&s;po&s;es a per&s;on to deprive another of his goods, without a ju&s;t equivalent, and thus reduce him to penury and wretchedne&s;s. And when power is united with avarice, all within the reach of that power, will feel the effects of this &s;elfi&s;h principle, for it produces inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion &amp; violence. Men have a legal right, by the laws of God and of &s;o|ciety, to their own goods and enjoyments, but to covet, or anxiou&s;ly de&s;ire them, is to be unju&s;t &amp; unmerciful to men.</P>

The thoughts are agitated, like the re&s;tle&s;s &s;ea, and the &s;oul laid open, to invite many fatal temptations. An increa&s;e of wealth increa&s;es anxiety and cares.

<P>WHY &s;hould we augment our burdens, by wi&s;h|ing for more, while travelling the journey of this tran&s;itory life? We brought nothing into the world, and we can carry nothing out of it. The de&s;ire and pur&s;uit of riches are lawful and lauda|ble, only when our governing motive is to do good; or by them, to enlarge the &s;phere of u&s;e|fulne&s;s. It is a low and criminal pa&s;&s;ion which prompts men to acquire wealth, for the &s;ake of wealth; and without the intention to employ it, to good and u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The frowns of heaven are upon the acqui&s;itions of the covetous,
<PB N="291" REF="028999_0279_0FDDD1E010CEF2B0">who pur&s;ue after wealth, for its own &s;ake. "As the &s;corching &s;un withers the gra&s;s, and it peri&s;h|eth, &s;o al&s;o &s;hall the covetous man fade away in his ways." Vain is the defence of riches a|gain&s;t the accidents of life, and the power of death. They avail not in the day of wrath. "Their &s;ilver and their gold &s;hall not be able to deliver them, in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they &s;hall not &s;atisfy their &s;ouls, neither fill their bowels." The covetous per&s;on, is tormented with the malevolent pa&s;&s;ion of envy. He is envi|ous at the pro&s;perity of his neighbor.</P>
<P>LET the experience of the wi&s;e&s;t and wealthie&s;t of the &s;ons of men, &s;atisfy us, of the vanity and vexation, which attends the pur&s;uit of riches, as the object of the &s;oul's felicity. Solomon &s;ought happine&s;s in riches, and earthly goods, and en|joyments. But the pur&s;uit was vain. He re|turned &s;orrowful and di&s;appointed. Each crea|ture &s;aid, happine&s;s is not in me. Let us hear his own account of the matter. "I &s;aid, I will prove thee, with mirth, therefore enjoy plea&s;ure; and behold, this al&s;o is vanity. I gave my&s;elf to wine and merriment.

I withheld not my heart from any joy. Then I looked upon all, and all was vanity and vexation of &s;pirit; and there is no profit under the &s;un. I hated all my labor, becau&s;e I &s;hould leave it to the man that &s;hould be after me, &amp; who know|eth
<PB N="292" REF="028999_0280_0FDDD1E1794A84E8">whether he &s;hall be a wi&s;e man or a fool." The&s;e concluding reflections are the re&s;ult of the large experience, of one, who was under the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantage to make the experiment; and who deliberately went to work, to find all that fe|licity, which this world can give. He in&s;cribes vanity and vexation on all things beneath the &s;un, pur&s;ued as an object, to &s;atisfy the immortal de&s;ires of the &s;oul. And what can he do who cometh after the king? But the object which he &s;o eagerly pur&s;ued, he found, where it is only to be found, in the love and fear of God. "Let us, &s;ays he, hear the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter, fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."</P>
<P>PERSONS are directed to make &s;uitable provi|&s;ion for this life, by diligence and care in &s;ome lawful calling; &s;en&s;ible of dependence on God; and to "u&s;e this world as not abu&s;ing it, for the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away."</P>
<P>THE love of this world is criminal, where it hinders the exerci&s;e of the duties of religion; or makes the heart cold and indifferent towards them.

<PB N="293" REF="028999_0281_0FDDD1E329441640">criminally to this world, and oppo&s;ed to God, and to its own true happine&s;s. Then does the heart go after its own covetou&s;ne&s;s. And he that thus loveth the world &s;upremely, the love of the father is not in him.</P>
<P>ALL the good which the world contains, is comprized by &s;aint John, in three things, <HI>plea&s;ure, wealth</HI> and <HI>honor,</HI> by the name of the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;ts of the eye, and the pride of life.

<P>THE man of this world, when invited to &s;ur|render back his heart, which has wandered from God, as the di&s;&s;ipated prodigal from his father's hou&s;e, forms many excu&s;es. "One goeth to his farm, and another to his merchandize." One to his worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, and another to his &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, and the &s;oul peri&s;hes with its peri&s;hable riches.</P>
<P>LET the conclu&s;ion of this di&s;cour&s;e impre&s;s our minds with this truth, that <HI>the expectation of permanent happine&s;s, in the things of this life, is vain.</HI> The immortal mind mu&s;t look above and beyond this world, for this invaluable pearl.

In the favor of God alone, &s;hall we find that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, of which no accidents, nor life, nor death, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, can deprive us.</P>
<P>THE happine&s;s of worldly men, is rather in appearance than real; and a poor kind of happi|ne&s;s at be&s;t. The crown of royalty is often a

All earthly things are changing, and tending to death. They will &s;oon be to us, as tho' they had never been. The good man, who hopes to &s;ee a kingdom which can never be moved, would not wi&s;h to live here always. To be the &s;port of unfore&s;een accidents, of expectations and di&s;appointments; of pains and plea&s;ures, of pro&s;trate hopes and fa|ding joys; is not that &s;tate of permanent re&s;t and happine&s;s, which our ever active &s;pirits pant after. They re&s;t only in that peace, which ari&s;es from a &s;weet &s;en&s;e of pardon and reconciliation with God; "that peace, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tand|ing, becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in the heart."</P>
<P>THE &s;hifting &s;cenes and &s;orrows of life, are wi&s;ely and mercifully ordered, by our creator, to convince us that this is not our home; and thus detach our minds from all &s;ublunary things, and elevate our noble&s;t ambition, and fix our hopes beyond the &s;kies.</P>
<P>BLESSED is the man, who overcomes, through the grace of the &s;aviour, the &s;ordid love of rich|es, and of this tran&s;itory life; and who minds religion now. To him, the &s;aviour addre&s;&s;es the&s;e comforting words, "He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he &s;hall be my &s;on."</P>
<P>LET the &s;olemn caution which is given us in this precept, be continually impre&s;&s;ed on all our minds, le&s;t at any time our "hearts be over charg|ed with the cares of this life," the flattering pro&s;|pects
<PB N="295" REF="028999_0283_0FDDD1E9BA047A60">of plea&s;ure, or the amu&s;ing charms of the world, and drown the good impre&s;&s;ions of the holy law of God, and the go&s;pel of his &s;on, on our minds.</P>
<P>SHALL we pant after the peri&s;hable goods of this life, and turn our back upon heavenly riches? Shall we fondly hug the phantoms of happine&s;s, which die in our embrace, and fooli&s;hly call them our portion? Shall we build &s;ub&s;tantial dwellings on the moving &s;ands, and &s;tormy &s;eas? Let us rather, with humble &amp; per&s;evering ardor, breathe after that never ending happine&s;s, which flows from the love of God, reconciled thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE &s;hortne&s;s of our time to prepare for hea|ven, ought to excite our mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitude, that we may obtain that eternal world. That you may obtain, let me, &s;irs, invite you to him, who has purcha&s;ed heaven for you, and who with unutterable compa&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;es you, &s;aying, "Come unto me, and I will give you re&s;t.

If &s;al|vation is lo&s;t, through a criminal love of this world, the &s;inner's choice will be without excu&s;e, and his condemnation without remedy.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE virtue of contentment, is oppo&s;ite to the vice of covetou&s;ne&s;s. Let us now attend to the nature and duties of this amiable virtue.</P>
<P>CONTENTMENT has its &s;eat in the mind. It is a &s;atisfaction with our condition, as ordered by God's providence. It is a virtue which re&s;pects principally our circum&s;tances in life. It is a free|dom from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing care and anxiety, to alter our condition; and contains a cheerful re&s;igna|tion, and grateful acquie&s;cence, in the di&s;tribu|tions of divine providence. It is a virtue which depends not on external appendages. Whether we are poor or rich, in ea&s;e or pain, in company or &s;olitude, in elevated &s;tations, or the humble walks of life. It is not in the power of earthly &s;cenes, to give or take it away. For true con|tentment ari&s;es from a higher &s;ource than this world's enjoyments. It &s;prings from a firm tru&s;t in God, and a humble grateful &s;en&s;e of depen|dence, and unworthine&s;s of the divine mercies. Several con&s;iderations may be &s;ugge&s;ted to e&s;tabli&s;h in our &s;ouls the divine virtue of contentment, &amp; to excite us to a daily cultivation of its plea&s;ant and profitable duties. As</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD is the munificent giver of all that we
<PB N="298" REF="028999_0286_0FDDD1F387AFC218">po&s;&s;e&s;s or enjoy. From him we receive the bene|fit of exi&s;tence, and all tho&s;e circum&s;tances which make it de&s;irable and happy. His rich gifts are to be received with gratitude. In his air we breathe, his &s;oil gives us bread, his &s;un warms, the fleeces of his flocks clothe us, and from his fore&s;ts we are provided with convenient dwellings. He continues to us the bounties of his providence, and us in the enjoyment of them. "In God we live and move and have our being." Whether God gives us little or much of this world's good, contentment and gratitude is demanded of us. "Be content with &s;uch things as ye have, for he hath &s;aid I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee." The providence of God is engaged to &s;upply our real wants. "The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou &s;atisfie&s;t the de&s;ire of every living thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are unworthy of the mercies of God, and cannot claim any good things which he be|&s;tows. Our mercies flow from his &s;overan plea|&s;ure. As we are &s;inners we have made our&s;elves unworthy of them. The &s;upreme Jehovah need|ed not creatures, to increa&s;e his own eternal hap|pine&s;s. To communicate happine&s;s to them, he was plea&s;ed to bring them into exi&s;tence. We have ungratefully rebelled again&s;t him, and ren|dered our&s;elves the objects of his righteous judg|ments. But in&s;tead of judgments, mercies are &s;howered down upon us. Every favor man en|joys, is more than he de&s;erves. A &s;en&s;e of un|worthine&s;s, and of the divine goodne&s;s, will ex|cite gratitude, contentment and peace in every ingenuous mind. In this frame was the patriarch Jacob, who, on the recollection of the pa&s;t mer|cies of God, and a lively &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent,
<PB N="299" REF="028999_0287_0FDDD1F8D95D9F30">exclaims, "O Lord, I am not worthy of all the mercies and all the truth which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant."</P>
<P N="3">3. MULTITUDES of our fellow men, as good or better than our&s;elves, are not &s;o well provided for. While we are in health; others are &s;ick: while we are &s;ick and accomodated; others are &s;ick and de&s;titute: while we have food &amp; cloathing; others &s;uffer with hunger and nakedne&s;s: while we are ble&s;&s;ed with rea&s;on, kindred and friends; others are deprived of their under&s;tanding, or have lo&s;t their deare&s;t friends by death: while we en|joy the advantages and comforts of &s;ocial and ci|vil life; others are pining in &s;lavery and bondage: while we enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed light of the go&s;pel, and means of &s;alvation; others are wandering in the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, without God, and hav|ing no hope in the world. When we &s;uffer, we are to con&s;ider that others have al&s;o &s;uffered as great or greater trials: and al&s;o that God can &s;u&s;tain and comfort us, in the greate&s;t. We are to remember that the hand of God, who does all things well, is in every affliction; and that it might have been much wor&s;e with us than it is. Better per&s;ons, the objects of heaven's peculiar care and kindne&s;s, have endured greater trials. Many ancient &s;aints, of whom the world was not worthy, were de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented; yet did contentedly bear the &s;poiling of their goods. Call to recollection the condition of Je&s;us, who was emphatically a man of &s;orrows, and yet per|fectly re&s;igned, and ever contented. Unparalleled &s;ufferings he endured for you; but yours are all merited. As no murmuring or di&s;contentment was found in him, in his great trials, let none be indulged by you. In his &s;uperior &s;orrows forget
<PB N="300" REF="028999_0288_0FDDD318DCB27368">your own; for yours are infinitely le&s;s than your de&s;erts.</P>
<P N="4">4. CONTENTMENT is nece&s;&s;ary to our happi|ne&s;s. It is indeed but another name for happi|ne&s;s. It is attended with peace of mind. Satis|&s;ied with the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, the mind enjoys peace. Serenity reigns within. The &s;oul that is plea&s;ed with the ways of God, all who&s;e ways are right, and di&s;mi&s;&s;es all anxious concerns for the peri&s;hable goods of life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es happine&s;s, which others vainly &s;eek, in the increa&s;e of wealth.</P>
<Q><L>"Content is wealth, the riches of the mind:</L>
<L>"And happy he who can that trea&s;ure find.</L>
<L>"But the bare mi&s;er &s;tarves amid his &s;tore,</L>
<L>"Broods on his gold, and griping &s;till at more,</L>
<L>"Sits &s;adly pining, and believes he's poor."</L></Q>
<P N="5">5. CONTENTMENT is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;efulne&s;s. As the contented per&s;on is prepared to obey God acceptably, he is prepared to &s;erve his generation u&s;efully. The contented man &s;eeks and pur&s;ues lawful and laudable means, to advance his own be&s;t intere&s;ts and happine&s;s; and he will al&s;o pur&s;ue the &s;ame, to promote the good of his neighbor. The di&s;contented per&s;on is a trouble to him&s;elf, and to others: but the contented are plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, and with others. He who would have friends, mu&s;t &s;hew him&s;elf friend|ly. And the example and labors of &s;uch, are mo&s;t likely to be good and u&s;eful to mankind.</P>
<P N="6">6. GREAT pro&s;it and advantage ari&s;es from the practice of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irtue. The contented mind en|joys a fea&s;t which never cloys. It finds arguments for gratitude and prai&s;e to God, in all po&s;&s;ible cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="301" REF="028999_0289_0FDD5FE7F4E0AEA0">and e&s;pecially at every fre&s;h in&s;tance of divine bounty. The chri&s;tian lives in charac|ter, who habitually cultivates this virtue. He will &s;weetly experience the truth of the declaration of the apo&s;tle, that "godline&s;s with contentment, is great gain."</P>
<P N="7">7. THE con&s;ideration of the &s;hortne&s;s of the time that we have to live, &s;hould be a motive to cultivate the virtue of contentment, with our worldly condition. Why &s;hould we be very anx|ious about what we &s;hall leave &s;o &s;oon? While we are in this world, the good providence of God will take care of us. The part which we are to act on the theatre of life is a&s;&s;igned us, and we &s;hall find &s;upport in the way of our duty. And he who confides in God will never be confounded.</P>
<P>THO' our condition in the world may be mean and poor, and our hopes cut off by un&s;een ca&s;ual|ties, let us ever bear in mind, that this is not our re&s;t, and that the &s;cene will &s;oon be changed. God's good providence may give us to &s;ee better days. Let hope and tru&s;t in God, bear up our &s;pirits, and animate our re&s;olutions in duty. Let us remember, that at death, and in the future world, it will not be of any con&s;equence to us, what our worldly condition has been; whether we were once rich or poor, honorable or di&s;ho|norable, the companions of princes or pea&s;ants; for death levels all di&s;tinctions. The only inqui|ry, which will then greatly concern us, will be, whether we have done well, as the children, &s;er|vants and friends of our God and Saviour. Po|verty and afflictions are among the in&s;trumental means of grace, and are oftimes &s;anctified, to the &s;piritual and eternal happine&s;s of tho&s;e who are
<PB N="302" REF="028999_0290_0FDD5FFD1C9AE040">&s;ubjected to them. This con&s;ideration &s;hould excite the earne&s;t de&s;ires of the afflicted and poor of this world, after tho&s;e durable riches, which the &s;aviour gives to the humble and poor in &s;pirit. "The light afflictions of this pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed." An increa&s;e of wealth is attended with temptations; and particularly the dangerous one of withdrawing the heart from God, and the intere&s;ts of eternity. Mankind are inclined to tru&s;t in riches, as their defence and confidence; there|fore we find repeated &s;olemn cautions, in the book of God, again&s;t the ardent pur&s;uit and love of them. "If riches increa&s;e, &s;et not thy heart up|on them." They &s;ometimes part the &s;oul from Chri&s;t; as we &s;ee in the in&s;tance of the young ruler, whom Je&s;us kindly invited to follow him, with the a&s;&s;urance, that he &s;hould have a trea&s;ure in hea|ven. But he went away &s;orrowful, becau&s;e he was rich. Alarming to tho&s;e, who&s;e hearts are ab&s;orbed in the love of this world, is the remark which the divine &s;aviour makes, on that occa&s;ion. "How hardly &s;hall they that have riches enter in|to the kingdom of heaven." For to u&s;e a fami|liar proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b, "it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go thro' the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."</P>
<P>GREAT gain is &s;ecured to tho&s;e in whom are united golline&s;s with contentment. The gain &s;e|cured by the union of the&s;e divine virtues, are &s;pi|ritual and eternal riches. And this is gain &s;uited to the ta&s;te, and worthy of the pur&s;uit, of the im|mortal mind. And of this gain, neither life nor death, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, can deprive the happy &s;ubject. For the favor of God is an eternal inheritance, and the happine&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaven, never fading trea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="028999_0291_0FDDD2C1EFE19950">
A GOOD or ill improvement of wealth, depends upon the di&s;po&s;ition of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. An increa&s;e of riches, alters not the di&s;po&s;ition of the conten|ted man, except, as it gives him opportunity to gratify his benevolent feelings, by enlarging the &s;phere of his u&s;efulne&s;s. For riches are de&s;irable only as a means of doing good. Should they in|crea&s;e or abate, his mind is fitted to his condition, and accommodates it&s;elf to the alteration of his cir|cum&s;tances. His heart is not proudly elevated with pro&s;perity, nor meanly depre&s;&s;ed in adver&s;ity. He makes not gold his confidence; but the lov|ing kindne&s;s of the Lord is his mo&s;t de&s;irable por|tion. But on the other hand the evils of di&s;con|tentment are many. They may be traced up to the &s;ources of pride, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and unbelief.</P>
<P N="1">1. PRIDE is a fruitful &s;ource of di&s;contentment. From this evil principle, originate rebellious murmurings again&s;t adver&s;e providences, and en|vious emotions of &s;oul at the pro&s;perity of others, and covetous de&s;ires to po&s;&s;e&s;s others goods. In&s;tead of rejoicing, it grieves at their happine&s;s. Actu|ated by this malignant principle, the proud &s;pirit &s;trives to ri&s;e and aggrandize it&s;elf, at the expence of the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s, of his neighbor. This haughty &s;pirit of proud di&s;content, is to be &s;ubdued by the cultivation of a meek and humble temper, and a di&s;po&s;ition to comport with the &s;tation, and condition a&s;&s;igned, by a wi&s;e provi|dence.</P>
<P>THE proud per&s;on is forever di&s;contented, and expo&s;ed to many mortifications. He is impelled to live beyond his circum&s;tances, and to draw ad|miration by the vain parade of life. Let pride and vain glory be mortified, by that humblene&s;s
<PB N="304" REF="028999_0292_0FDDD2C38EAC5CE8">of mind, which is amiable in the view of the world, and "in the &s;ight of God, of great price. God exalteth the humble, and aba&s;eth the proud."</P>
<P N="2">2. SELFISHNESS is another &s;ource of di&s;content|ment. It is a principle which engro&s;&s;es every thing to it&s;elf, and like the circling whirlpool, draws all things to its own centre. It gra&s;ps after the goods of others; is not &s;atisfied with compe|tency; but labours to po&s;&s;e&s;s what it cannot en|joy. Like the grave it is never &s;atisfied. How did di&s;content rankle in the felfi&s;h brea&s;t of Ha|man? Tho' elevated to all the honors of a royal court, he was mo&s;t unhappy, becau&s;e Mordecai refu&s;ed him a &s;ervile bow. To what extremes of inju&s;tice and cruelty, did his &s;elfi&s;h di&s;content tran&s;port him, when, to gratify it, he &s;ought to de|&s;troy a whole nation? But the ju&s;tice of heaven &s;ometimes interpo&s;es, to puni&s;h the flagitious crimes of individuals, in this life; that others may hear and fear. The crafty are caught by their own devices, and the ruin which they meditated for others, comes upon their own head.</P>
<P N="3">3. DISBELIEF of God's governing providence, is a &s;ource of di&s;contentment. Unbelief is blind to that liberal hand of the munificent parent of the Univer&s;e, that pours in rich profu&s;ion, his bounties upon his creatures; who cau&s;es the &s;un to ri&s;e, and the rain to de&s;cend, on the evil and on the good, and on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t. To guard again&s;t a &s;inful di&s;tru&s;t of that ever active providence, which protects and provides for us, our Lord called the attention of his di&s;ciples to the lilies of the field, and the birds of the air. A&s;|&s;uring them, that the Almighty hand which clothes the one, in all their gay and blooming colors;
<PB N="305" REF="028999_0293_0FDDD2C847F4BA58">and that feeds the other, will much more take care of men, and e&s;pecially of good men, who are of more value than lilies and &s;parrows.</P>
<P N="4">4. DISCONTENTMENT with our condition, di&s;|qualifies us for duty. It is oppo&s;ed to that pati|ent and re&s;igned temper, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render our offerings and &s;ervices acceptable to God, and our lives a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind. "The meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way."</P>
<P N="5">5. IT di&s;covers a di&s;po&s;ition to take up with a portion in the goods of this life. It is e&s;timating too highly the things of this world, the fa&s;hion of which is &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;ing away. The di&s;contented per&s;on places his chief de&s;ires, and enjoyments in the goods of this world, as tho' his happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in the abundance of temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But rea&s;on would dictate to us, that &s;ince this life is of &s;hort duration, and the time of our death uncertain; and &s;ince the &s;oul will exi&s;t forever, the comforts and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this world, &s;hould be valued and &s;ought after, as &s;ub&s;ervient to our future and immortal exi&s;tance. The folly of placing a dependence on temporal goods and en|joyments, will be &s;trikingly &s;een in the &s;olemn hour of death. What will they then profit a man? It is illu&s;trated by our Lord, in the parable of the rich man, "who &s;aid to his &s;oul, &s;oul thou ha&s;t much goods laid up in &s;tore for many years; take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink and be merry: but God &s;aid, thou fool, this night &s;hall thy &s;oul be requir|ed of thee; then who&s;e &s;hall tho&s;e things be which thou ha&s;t provided? So is he that layeth up trea&s;ures for him&s;elf, and is not rich towards God."</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="028999_0294_0FDDD2CB997E2F20">
THE like folly and madne&s;s appears in him, at who&s;e inho&s;pitable gate, afflicted Lazarus lay. In this world he had his good things, tho' &s;hort in duration, and in the other, his evil things, of end|le&s;s continuance. Tho' he fared delicately here, for this world was all the heaven and happine&s;s he wi&s;hed to know, yet in hell he lift up his eyes in torment, and &s;aw between him, and the &s;eat of the ble&s;&s;ed, &amp; impa&s;&s;able gulf. A deplorable choice of the man of plea&s;ure and of this world, an eter|nity of mi&s;ery, for a few years of plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>THE folly of fixing on the goods of this world for happine&s;s al&s;o appears, in that we &s;hall have no u&s;e for them after death. They will then for|ever flee away. That which we want but for a &s;hort time, we &s;hould &s;eek to obtain with a degree of indifference, compared with that good which we &s;hall want forever.</P>
<P N="6">6. DISCONTENTMENT di&s;covers an unwilling|ne&s;s to be di&s;po&s;ed of, as God &s;hall &s;ee be&s;t; and a contempt al&s;o of pre&s;ent mercies. To be un|ea&s;y with our condition, as it is ordered by God's providence, is to murmur at the divine govern|ment: but is it not &s;afer to &s;ubmit to the di&s;po|&s;als of infinite wi&s;dom, than to follow the dic|tates of our own imperfect and limited under|&s;tanding? If left to our own choice, no doubt our choice would end in ruin. Let us leave the care and di&s;po&s;al of our&s;elves in this, and in all worlds with God; for God is infinitely wi&s;e and good; and let it be our great concern, to conform our&s;elves to all the notices of his will, in all condi|tions of life. The di&s;contented al&s;o ungratefully mi&s;improve pre&s;ent mercies. They overlook them, and wi&s;h for others. The di&s;contented
<PB N="307" REF="028999_0295_0FDDD2CCF7819C28">have ground to fear that they &s;hall be puni&s;hed by the removal of mercies already abu&s;ed, and the cutting off of tho&s;e, which would have been given them. God demands a grateful acknowledge|ment of mercies enjoyed, or hoped for. "For the&s;e things I will be inquired of, to do it for them."</P>
<P>IT is difficult to convince the di&s;contented of the inexcu&s;ablene&s;s and guilt of this &s;in. They per&s;uade them&s;elves that they have ju&s;t cau&s;e. So the peevi&s;h prophet Jonah thought that he did well to be angry, &amp; was hard to be convinced, even when his maker conde&s;cended to expo&s;tulate with him on his unrea&s;onable di&s;contentment. Per&s;ons of this &s;pirit are ready to alledge in their ju&s;tification, that they cannot cure a fretful temper. But this cannot be admited in excu&s;e, becau&s;e this temper is their &s;in. They do not labor to &s;ubdue it. The remedy again&s;t either a fretful, ha&s;ty or di&s;|contented temper, is the cultivation of a deep &s;en&s;e of unworthine&s;s, and accountablene&s;s to God.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons alledge, that they ought to re&s;ent with &s;pirit, injuries brought upon them by men. But no man is qualified to re&s;ent an injury from men, unle&s;s his mind is &s;olemnly impre&s;&s;ed with the belief, that the hand of God is in it, permit|ing it for his be&s;t good. While we lawfully re|&s;i&s;t evil from men, we are meekly to &s;ubmit to the divine correction therein. Tho' they mean it for evil, God intends it for good. We come,</P>
<P>LASTLY, to recommend and urge tho&s;e friend|ly and benevolent affections towards men, which will powerfully incline us to promote their intere&s;ts
<PB N="308" REF="028999_0296_0FDDD2D308FBE188">and happine&s;s in all re&s;pects. The principle that combines in one, all the precepts of duty to man|kind, is <HI>love.</HI> "Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf, for love is the fulfiling of the law." If this great principle of the law and go&s;pel, reigns in our hearts, we &s;hall be happily &s;ecured from all the evils, comprehended in the &s;in of co|veting the goods of others. In all ca&s;es, let that comprehen&s;ive precept given by our Lord, as the daily directory of every chri&s;tian, be in&s;cribed on the heart, "as ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them." And &s;incerely practi&s;ing upon this rule we &s;hall keep his com|mandments of duty to mankind. Let &s;ome prac|tical reflections apply and conclude this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE infer the criminal nature and effects of covetou&s;ne&s;s; or an extreme &s;olicitude for the goods of this world, to the neglect of the &s;oul's immortal intere&s;ts. Short and uncertain is this tran&s;itory life! How &s;oon &s;hall we leave all that the world e&s;teems great and de&s;irable, and about which our thoughts, our hopes and fears, are agitated, enraptured or alarmed. Let our &s;ouls ri&s;e &s;uperior to the world, and make the heavenly inheritance their principal object. And &s;uffer not the affections to be placed on earthly, to the neglect of heavenly riches. The goods of this world will &s;oon be to the owners, as though they had never been. "Make to your&s;elves friends of the mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everla&s;ting ha|bitations." By &s;uch a contented and u&s;eful em|ployment of your earthly riches and advantages, to the glory of God and the happine&s;s of your fellow men, your good works will go before you into heaven, and give a welcome to your admit|tance
<PB N="309" REF="028999_0297_0FDDD2D551841D98">there. But on the other hand, what dread|ful pro&s;pects will the worldly &s;pirit have, on his admi&s;&s;ion to the world of &s;pirits: that world for which he has made no preparation, and where neither peri&s;hable riches, nor &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, will be found? With a &s;oul ab&s;orbed in earthly objects, he will find no objects there &s;uited to his ta&s;te. Though he may have been wi&s;e for this world, he will be condemned as mo&s;t unwi&s;e for eternity, and doomed to dwell with the unholy and unclean.</P>
<P N="2">2. To guard again&s;t the ruinous love of this world, let us, &s;irs, learn the divine art of living above it. Rai&s;e your heaven born &s;oul to riches and joys, worthy the dignity of its immortal na|ture, and open your heart to receive the great &s;alvation.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ouls are in the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s. That happine&s;s which the immortal &s;pirit pants after, can be found only in the friend&s;hip and love of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Intere&s;ted in this &s;alvation, the &s;oul will hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, after happine&s;s in earthly joys.</P>
<P>LASTLY, let us cultivate a mind &s;atisfied with all the allotments of divine providence. Re&s;ig|nation to the will of God is the perfection of du|ty and happine&s;s. Let us learn with the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, in what&s;oever &s;tate we are, therewith to be content. Our life is ha&s;tening to a clo&s;e. Our &s;alvation is the one thing needful, let it be pur&s;ued with all the ardor of our &s;ouls. Labor not for the meat which peri&s;heth, but for that which endureth unto everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>WE have now, my brethren, come to the con|clu&s;ion

<P>THIS comprehen&s;ive &s;entence expre&s;&s;es the purity and perfection of that divine law which God gave to mankind, as the &s;tandard of truth and &s;ummary of duty.

The prohibition of the&s;e, in the tenth commandment, convinced Paul that he was a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law. The other precepts he explained, while depending on his own righteou&s;ne&s;s for &s;alvation, as refering principally or altogether to external duties: but when he examined him&s;elf by that precept which regulates the heart, he found him|&s;elf deficient. <HI>For I had not known lu&s;t, except the law had &s;aid, thou &s;halt not covet.</HI> The whole law is proclaimed holy, and that precept in par|ticular, which condemns the &s;ecret &s;in of coveting.</P>
<P>WHEN it is a&s;&s;erted that the moral law was given to man at his creation, that it was written upon his heart, and the like; it is to be under|&s;tood with &s;ome limitation. Adam in his <HI>&s;olitary</HI> condition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> creation, had no occa&s;ion for the ob&s;ervance of the precepts of the &s;econd table of the law.

<P N="1">1. THE &s;upreme lawgiver is a &s;pirit, and the author of our &s;pirits, and demands the homage and obedience of our &s;pirits. The law demands the perfection of the obedience. It gives up none of its ju&s;t claims, in conde&s;cention to hu|man weakne&s;s. In all the &s;olemn exerci&s;es of
<PB N="313" REF="028999_0301_0FDDD2E137EB8958">religion &amp; devotion, or tho&s;e duties towards God which it demands, he, who&s;e thoughts, in the multitude and endle&s;s variety of them, and all his words and actions, are not in all re&s;pects per|fectly right, and conformed to the divine will, is guilty in the view of the law. A &s;ingle evil thought o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ire de&s;troys that perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s which the law requires, and the per&s;on falls under its condemning &s;entence. No one has kept the perfect law of love and obedience to God, who has ever indulged a &s;ingle &s;inful thought. On the &s;uppo&s;ition that a per&s;on could be found, who is meerly negatively righteous, or who had never po&s;itively tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in thought or beha|viour; yet would he fall under the condemnati|on of the law, becau&s;e the law requires po&s;itive duties; not only an ab&s;tinence from all tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, but the practice of every virtue. And the duties required, are to be performed with our utmo&s;t ability. With the be&s;t judgment, will and affections. It requires that we love God with all the heart, might and mind, con&s;tantly, and forever. If then there is a &s;ingle moment, in which our &s;ouls are not filled with the habit and exerci&s;e of the highe&s;t love to God, of which we are capable, we tran&s;gre&s;s, by a deficiency of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which the law requires. If we could have loved God with a more pure and ar|dent affection at any time, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame.

<P>IN a word, if at any time a vain or idle thought has come into our minds; or if our thoughts are not exerci&s;ed con&s;tantly and intirely about tho&s;e holy, good and u&s;eful objects and duties which its &s;acred precepts demand, we come &s;hort of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, and are condemned.

<P N="2">2. THE &s;ame perfection of duty al&s;o, the mo|ral law requires of us towards our fellow men. It is not &s;atisfied if we are only negatively righte|ous towards men; or that we do no harm and in|jure none. It demands po&s;itive and perfect du|ties. It not only requires that you &s;hould never allow room in your heart, for a &s;ingle evil thought or wi&s;h, to the prejudice of your fellow men; that you feel no emotion of envy at another's pro&s;pe|rity; that you never think ill, much le&s;s &s;peak evil of him; that you feel no di&s;po&s;ition to re|venge any injury he has done you; or that you neither think, or &s;peak or do any thing injurious to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;on, his property or reputation. Not only the&s;e negative virtues are demanded; but po&s;itive duties are to be performed, and that per|fectly. The law demands that you love your neighbor as your&s;elf. That you love him &s;incere|ly,
<PB N="315" REF="028999_0303_0FDDD2E973318F70">con&s;tantly, without interruption or abatement. That you love him with your utmo&s;t ability and do him good with all your power. That you comfort him in affliction, in di&s;tre&s;s relieve him, and in error wi&s;h &amp; &s;trive to reclaim him. That you weep with the &s;orrowful and rejoice with the pro&s;perous. It al&s;o requires that the &s;tandard of your love to him &s;hould be fixed and immutable: and that the love which you have to your&s;elf, &s;hould be the rule and mea&s;ure of your love to him. That the &s;ame kind of love which you have for your&s;elf, for your own per&s;on, intere&s;t and happine&s;s, you &s;hould feel and exerci&s;e for the per&s;on, the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of others. It requires a &s;till harder le&s;&s;on of you, that is, that you &s;hould exerci&s;e this perfect love to your <HI>per|&s;onal enemies;</HI> and that no injuries which they have done you, &s;hould abate your love to them. God's perfect law further requires that this love and the&s;e duties, proceed from a principle of habitual love to God. And that in all your thoughts and conduct towards men, you never entertain any &s;elfi&s;h or &s;ini&s;ter end or mo|tive; but perpetually &s;eek their happine&s;s, in the glory of God. Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may di&s;cover &s;omething of the purity and perfection of the law, as it holds forth the duties and virtues which are requi&s;ite to our own &s;elf government, over our thoughts, affections, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. By our Lord's explana|tion of the &s;ixth, &s;eventh and ninth command|ments, in the go&s;pel, and by his remarks on the obligations of the whole of our duty to men, we &s;ee that our undi&s;&s;embled love &s;hould embrace enemies well as friends; and by the expre&s;s letter of the la&s;t precept of the law, we find, that is required,
<PB N="316" REF="028999_0304_0FDDD2EB06A76E20">that the heart &s;hould be not only intirely free from, and emptied of all &s;inful anger, all lu&s;tful impure de&s;ires, and all envious, malevolent and covetous pa&s;&s;ions; but that the oppo&s;ite virtues of benevo|lence, kindne&s;s, cha&s;tity of thought and beha|viour, and thoughts and de&s;ires rai&s;ed above this world, &s;hould live and reign in the heart, as a liv|ing and perpetual &s;pring and principle of action, in all duty to God and to mankind. And that the&s;e virtues &s;hould be practi&s;ed by us, in the high|e&s;t &amp; mo&s;t perfect degre, of which we are capable.</P>
<P>THUS we are taught that the heart of man is the &s;ubject to which God's perfect law is addre&s;|&s;ed; and that he who&s;e heart is not in perfect &s;ubjection to all and every precept thereof, and that al&s;o in the mo&s;t perfect manner, is de&s;titute of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, and is convinced of the law as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and falls under its condemnation. How broad and exten&s;ive is this perfect law of God! It requires perpetual love and &s;inle&s;s obedience to God, without the lea&s;t interruption, and that in the mo&s;t pure and per|fect manner of which the rational nature of man is capable. And a &s;ingle &s;inful thought or wi&s;h, or the omi&s;&s;ion of one known duty &s;ubjects the offender to a forfeiture of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, and to all its dreadful penalties.</P>
<P>THIS condemnation it proclaims again&s;t him, who fails in one &s;ingle duty of righteou&s;ne&s;s, love and mercy to men. And on him al&s;o, who fails in a &s;ingle in&s;tance of &s;elf government; the virtues of who&s;e mind are not pure and &s;potle&s;s, and wholly conformed the perfect law of God. The law demands the perfection of obedience in the whole of man's three&s;old duty to God, to
<PB N="317" REF="028999_0305_0FDDD2EF7A4B62B8">mankind and our&s;elver. And the rea&s;on of this is, that the law is founded on the immutable prin|ciples of right rea&s;on. It is the revealed will of God, who&s;e will is the fountain of unchangeable rectitude. To man in his pre&s;ent lap&s;ed &amp; guilty condition, the law may &s;eem awfully &s;evere: but to man in innocency, it appeared mo&s;t good, ju&s;t and holy.</P>
<P>SAINT James expre&s;&s;es the perfect rectitude &amp; purity of the law, when he &s;ays,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>James</HI> 2, 10.</NOTE> "Who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The ob&s;ervance of the law in &s;ome of its requirements, will not ex|cu&s;e neglect in others. The wilful omi&s;&s;ion or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle precept, is an act of di&s;o|bedience to God. Our obligation to keep the whole law perfectly ari&s;es from the authority of the &s;upreme lawgiver. "He that &s;aid, do not commit adultery, &s;aid al&s;o do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery; yet if thou kill, thou art become a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law." What|ever is commanded or forbidden in the law, is by the divine authority. To tran&s;gre&s;s a particu|lar precept of the will of God, is an offence to the divine authority. The will of God in the pre&s;cription of laws to his creatures, is rea&s;on &amp; motive &s;ufficient to demand obedience; whether his creatures are able to unable to comprehend the rea&s;onablene&s;s of them, or whether they com|port with their inclination, or not. And di&s;obedi|ence to one &s;ingle precept is di&s;obedience to the whole authority of God. On the &s;uppo&s;ition that a per&s;on &s;hould perfectly keep the whole law, ex|cept in one &s;ingle in&s;tance; would his obedience be acceptable? Could he claim life by his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s?
<PB N="318" REF="028999_0306_0FDDD2F108BC63A0">Would he do the will of God?

Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not only forfeited, but guilt is imputed. As the breaking a &s;ingle link of a chain breaks the chain; and as wounding one member, wounds the body; &s;o the violation of a &s;ingle precept, is a violation of the whole law. And for one offence, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or incurs the penalty which it pronounces again&s;t tho&s;e, who keep it not perfectly. His <HI>one</HI> offence deprives him of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, as effectual|ly, as if he had not kept a &s;ingle precept, or had broken the whole: for it accepts of no righteou&s;|ne&s;s, except a perfect one.

<P>THIS, &s;irs, is that perfect law of love and &s;pot|le&s;s obedience, which God gave to man, &amp; made man capable of obeying. And this law is &s;till in force again&s;t us. Here let us for a moment pau&s;e. And allow me to a&s;k, has not this holy law concluded us all under &s;in and condemna|tion? Will any &s;ay that they are perfect touching

But on the &s;uppo&s;ition that this moment your heart is changed, and you have no more di&s;po&s;ition to &s;in than Adam had in in|nocency, &amp; can keep the law perfectly in thought, word and deed for the time to come; will your future righteou&s;ne&s;s ju&s;tify you? Will you claim &s;alvation by the covenant of works? It is evident that you cannot; becau&s;e that covenant was giv|en to man to keep by virtue of the powers of his own free will, without the aid of <HI>&s;pecial</HI> grace; but if you keep the law by virtue of grace imparted, your righteou&s;ne&s;s is of grace, and con&s;equently your &s;alvation too, will be of grace. And be|cau&s;e al&s;o, in this ca&s;e, you are condemned for pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, for the law of works promi&s;es life only to perfect obedience. Are any &s;o vain as to dream that they are perfect and clean from &s;in? Tho&s;e who are under this delu&s;ion are great|ly ignorant of them&s;elves and of the law. "If we &s;ay we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us."

<P>WHEN we reflect on the &s;potle&s;s purity, &s;piri|rituality and perfection of the law, and the deep depravity and guilt of our nature, and that eve|ry imagination of the thoughts are naturally evil, and contrary to that perfection of purity, love and obedience, which the law demands, we may

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL tho&s;e who embrace the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are convinced of &s;in by the law. A di&s;|covery of the nature and demands of God's perfect law, gives the &s;oul a conviction of &s;in, and the certainty and ju&s;tice of his condemnation. And thus the law leads and compels the &s;inner to the Saviour.</P>
<P><HI>CHRIST is the end of the law,</HI> as the law was fulfilled in all its requirements by him. By his active obedi|ence, he fulfilled all that the law required of man; and by his &s;ufferings &s;atisfied for offences. He is the <HI>end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as he fini&s;hed a righteou&s;ne&s;s perfect in all its parts, and &s;atisfactory to the ju&s;tice, pu|rity and perfection of the law, in all re&s;pects.

<P>BOTH the ceremonial and moral law received their end and accompli&s;hment in him.

<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Galatians</HI> 3.24.</NOTE> In the words cho&s;en for the theme of this di&s;cour&s;e, the apo&s;tle u&s;es the word in this la&s;t &s;en&s;e. Let us then &s;ee <HI>how Chri&s;t is the end of the ce|remonial and the moral law.</HI> Chri&s;t is the end of the ceremonial law, as that law received its fulfilment in him. The ceremonial law was given to the ancient church at Sinai, and con&s;i&s;ted of various typical rites &amp; &s;acrifices, refering to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp; the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace to be introduced into the world by him. The &s;a|cred &s;ervices of the Jewi&s;h tabernacle and temple, were de&s;igned to maintain the knowledge of the true G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and to keep alive the expectation of the Saviour, who had been promi&s;ed at the apo&s;tacy. When Chri&s;t came and fi|ni&s;hed the work of redemption, the &s;pecial care and pro|tection, which God had &s;hewn to the people of I&s;rael, cea&s;ed. Sacrifices were the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and burden|&s;ome part of the ceremonial law: but they were no longer nece&s;&s;ary after the promi&s;ed Saviour had offered up him&s;elf, a &s;acrifice for the fins of men.</P>
<P>SACRIFICES of atonement were common among pa|gan nations; and the cu&s;tom is a confirmation of the divinity of original revelation. They mu&s;t have bor|rowed it from this &s;ource; becau&s;e the principles of na|tural rea&s;on could not have di&s;covered a connection be|tween the death of an animal, and the pardon of &s;in.
<PB N="223" REF="028999_0311_0FDDD3032B564CA0">And it al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the doctrine of human depravity, and the nece&s;&s;ity of atonement for &s;in, was the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of mankind. The &s;acrifices of the law pointed out the certainty and the nece&s;&s;ity of the death of Chri&s;t. It was certain, becau&s;e God had promi&s;ed; and it was nece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e the ju&s;tice of the law demanded an adequate &s;atisfaction. On the certainty of the death of Chri&s;t, the ancient patriarchs and &s;aints were &s;aved. Death and the cur&s;e came by the fir&s;t Adam's eating of the fruit of the interdicted tree; and life and immor|tality are given to believers, &s;ince Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam bore death and the cur&s;e, on the tree of the cro&s;s. This manner of death is called in the law of Mo&s;es, an accur|&s;ed death, probably refering to the death which Chri&s;t &s;hould endure, that he might remove from man, the cur&s;e due to &s;in.</P>
<P>THE epi&s;tle to the Hebrews is a commentary on the ritual of the ceremonial law, and &s;hews how the &s;acri|fices and &s;ervices of that di&s;pen&s;ation, received their full accompli&s;hment in Chri&s;t. It was a figure of good things to come. The &s;elf righteous Jews re&s;ted their hopes of acceptance with God, and of eternal happine&s;s, in their ob&s;ervance of that external law. In&s;tead of at|tending to tho&s;e &s;acrifices and &s;ervices, as the way to lead them to Chri&s;t, they tru&s;ted in them, as the end of their duty. To the &s;en&s;ual &amp; &s;elf righteous, they were as a veil that hid Chri&s;t from them, &s;o that "they could not look &s;tedfa&s;tly to the end;" but righteous men &s;aw Chri&s;t thro' the veil of ceremonies, and to them both the preceptive and ceremonial laws, &s;erved as a &s;choolma&s;ter to lead them to Chri&s;t. They contained the <HI>alphabet</HI> of the go&s;pel, and taught the doctrine of grace thro' a mediator. When Chri&s;t expired upon the cro&s;s, having made atonement for &s;in, the veil of the temple was rent a&s;under, to &s;ignify, that the ceremonial law &amp; the levitical prie&s;thood, were no more. The order of Aaron was at an end, the &s;ceptre then departed from Ju|dah; for Shiloh had come, and to him the people out of all nations, were &s;oon to be gathered. As the ceremo|nial law of the ancient church received its end, de&s;ign and accompli&s;hment in Chri&s;t; let us now enquire how
<PB N="324" REF="028999_0312_0FDDD307F5F0CAC8">Chri&s;t is the <HI>end of the moral law.</HI> Chri&s;t is the end of the moral law in two re&s;pects, fir&s;t, as he perfectly kept it, and &s;econdly as by his obedience and &s;uffering, a righteou&s;ne&s;s is fini&s;hed, by which &s;inners, whom the law condemns, may be &s;aved. He always did tho&s;e things which plea&s;ed God, and &s;o to do was the fulfilment of the law, for the moral law is the revealed will or plea&s;ure of God. He loved God with all his heart, and mankind as him&s;elf, con&s;tantly and perfectly. Each particular precent of the moral law, was perfectly obeyed by aim. He de&s;ghted to do the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of God. His whole life was filled up with obedience to God, and love to mankind. He fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s in his obedience to the po|&s;itive and moral laws of Jehovah. He gave the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious evidence of obedience to God, and love to men, in his life and in his death. He &s;hewed in the view of the intelligent univer&s;e, that the law which man was made to obey, was holy, ju&s;t and good, by the obedience which he rendered to it. He magnified the law and made it honorable. And by obeying and &s;uffering the penalty of the law, he has brought in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s; a righteou&s;ne&s;s by which, on the con&s;titution of grace, the penitent believer in Je&s;us, is delivered from condem|nation, and admitted to eternal life.</P>

<P N="1">1. MANKIND by the guilt of &s;in orfeited life and fell under the condemnation of the covenant of works. The mercy of God has provided for them the milder di&s;pen|&s;ation of grace, by the mediation of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The tenor of the fir&s;t covenant was, <HI>obey and thou &s;halt live.</HI> The tenor of the covenant of grace is <HI>believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> The un&s;earch|able wi&s;dom of the Deity devi&s;ed this plan of grace, by which the law maintains its authority; for its precepts are obeyed, and its ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, by a divine &s;urety, and life is given to the guilty. And God can now be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of the ungodly, and grace reigns, thro' <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> unto eternal life, towards them that believe. It is con&s;i&s;tent with this wonderful grace, that
<PB N="325" REF="028999_0313_0FDDD30A852D2A30">the endle&s;s and ble&s;&s;ed benefits of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be placed to the account of believers in him; and that as to them, the condemning &s;entence of the law &s;hould be repealed. Tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are &s;aid to be ju&s;ti|fied. Let us inquire into the nature of ju&s;tification, and the imputation of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to belie|vers. Ju&s;tification is a term borrowed from the u&s;age of civil courts, in which the per&s;on accu&s;ed is acquitted on the law's being &s;atisfied, either by him&s;elf or his &s;urety. Ju&s;tification is oppo&s;ed to condemnation. Such is the merciful tenor of the covenant of grace, that a &s;urety is accepted on the &s;inner's behalf, and the guilty are de|clared righteous on account of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the divine &s;aviour. To them there is no condemnation. The ju&s;tified per&s;on was once under the condemnation of the law; but on his believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his &s;ins are pardoned, and he is accepted as a righteous per&s;on, on account of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, imputed. He is acquitted from the guilt of pa&s;t &s;ins, and from the de|&s;erved puni&s;hment. The law is &s;atisfied, and the peni|tent believer is ju&s;tified. Ju&s;tification does not imply that a per&s;on is inherently or perfectly freed from all &s;in, or the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;inning; but it is an act of grace, by which he is declared ju&s;t with re&s;pect to the law which he has broken. Pa&s;t &s;ins are remitted, and for the merciful remi&s;&s;ion of all &s;ins to which they are liable, by the force of temptations and depraved nature, for the time to come, believers have an advocate with the fa|ther, who ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them, on their repentance and &s;upplication.</P>
<P N="2">2. JUSTIFICATION is a &s;ovran and gracious act of God in which he does not di&s;pen&s;e with his law, nor acquit the &s;inner without the law receiving honorable &s;atisfaction. It was &s;ovran grace which provided the remedy. In this was manife&s;ted the love of God, that he gave his &s;on to redeem us. As the general plan of the redemption of &s;inners, was an act of &s;ovran grace, &s;o al&s;o is the appli|cation of that redemption to individuals. He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. And God ju&s;tly leaves tho&s;e who reject &s;alvation, to the fatal con&s;equences of
<PB N="326" REF="028999_0314_0FDDD30BF5A63120">their own choice. He will glorify his ju&s;tice on the ve&s;|&s;els of wrath, who by the love and practice of &s;in, have fitted them&s;elves for de&s;truction. Sufficient means of knowledge and conviction are given the impenitent to leave them inexcu&s;able, &s;elf condemned, and proper objects of the awful cur&s;es of the broken law.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE divine &s;pirit is the heavenly agent by who&s;e powerful operation attending the in&s;trumental means of grace, the &s;inner is brought to a &s;tate of ju&s;tification. This he does by convincing of the nature and guilt of &s;in, of the nece&s;&s;ity of a righteou&s;ne&s;s an&s;werable to the law's de|mands, and of the judgment which will be pa&s;&s;ed upon all who fall under its condemning &s;entence. By grace ye are &s;aved, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and the re|newing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE ju&s;tified will not come into condemnation. Their &s;tability is &s;ecured by their union to their &s;piri|tual head, the &s;econd Adam, the Lord from heaven. They are members of his body, and branches in him the living vine. And becau&s;e he lives, they &s;hall live al&s;o. Every &s;incere believer in Je&s;us, may with &s;aint Paul, bid the heroic challenge, "Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died; yea, rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;|&s;ion for us. And who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?"</P>
<P N="5">5. THE believer is ju&s;tified by a righteou&s;ne&s;s impu|ted. Unable to &s;atisfy the demands of the law, it became nece&s;&s;ary to man's &s;alvation, that a &s;urety &s;hould &s;atisfy for him. And help was laid on one mighty to &s;ave. The rea&s;on why man cannot &s;atisfy the demands of the law, is that by his guilty apo&s;tacy, he has lo&s;t both the abi|lity and the inclination to keep it. By nature the &s;ervant of &s;in and enemy of holine&s;s, and when renewed by grace, his be&s;t obedience is weak and imperfect. And there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth, who &s;inneth not. The holy angels could not &s;atisfy the law for man. Their be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect obedience, the law which they are under, demands from them con&s;tantly and &s;orever. They
<PB N="327" REF="028999_0315_0FDDD30D85F84648">have no &s;urplu&s;age of merit to place to man's account. But the ability of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to accompli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which the &s;inner can be ju&s;tified, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manife&s;t, ina&s;much as he is a divine per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the perfections of Deity, uncreated and independent. He was the &s;on of God united to a perfect and innocent man, the &s;econd Adam. His merit is infinite. By his obedience and &s;ufferings in the human nature, he fini&s;hed a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;atisfactory to the ju&s;tice of the law, and &s;uffici|ent al&s;o for the purcha&s;e of eternal life for his di&s;ciples. The righteou&s;ne&s;s which Chri&s;t fini&s;hed on earth was de&s;igned for the u&s;e and advantage of mankind. This, &s;ays the prophet, is the name by which he &s;hall be called, <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which our &s;ins were imputed to Chri&s;t, his righteou&s;ne&s;s is imputed to us. As he felt the dreadful effects of &s;ins which he had not committed, &s;o believers enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed benefits of a righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they them&s;elves have not accom|pli&s;hed. The effects, or the puni&s;hment of &s;in were borne by Chri&s;t; and the rewards of his obedience are given to believers. As our &s;ins de&s;erved death, and death was in|flicted on our &s;urety, &s;o his obedience merits life, and life is given to all who are pardoned and ju&s;tified by his redemption.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ubjects of ju&s;tification are believers in Chri&s;t. Evangelical faith compri&s;es knowledge and love; a knowledge of the divine character, and of the law as holy ju&s;t and good. A knowledge of per&s;onal guilt and un|worthine&s;s, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a holy and almighty Saviour. The&s;e important doctrines the mind receives as divinely true, and embraces them with cordial appro|bation; and with humble gratitude repo&s;es its immortal intere&s;ts in the hands of the ble&s;&s;ed mediator, and pleads his all perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the only ground of hope and acceptance with God. To conclude,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE learn from the nature of the law, and from the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, that man has not a righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own in which he can with &s;afety appear; and that we fall under the dreadful condemnation of that law
<PB N="328" REF="028999_0316_0FDDD31300E67030">which gives us the knowledge of the guilt and de&s;ert of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Since, &s;irs, &s;uch is our unhappy condition, let us never cea&s;e to admire and adore, that wonderful wi&s;dom and grace of God in our redemption, which makes it con&s;i&s;tent with the rectitude and goodne&s;s of the divine government, to receive a &s;atisfaction to ju&s;tice rendered by our divine &s;urety, and not exact it at our hands. Had it been demanded of us, alas, we mu&s;t have been ca&s;t in|to the pri&s;on of eternal de&s;pair, there to have remained thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncea&s;ing ages, &s;ince we could never have paid the uttermo&s;t farthing, of the immen&s;e debt which we owe to the divine ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE learn that &s;alvation is not applied to men ab&s;o|lutely and unconditionally. It is by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we become intitled to the ble&s;&s;ed benefits of a righteou&s;|ne&s;s which &s;atisfies the law's demands, and purcha&s;es for us an eternity of happine&s;s. We hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. INFER the duty of an immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine plan of grace revealed in the go&s;pel. There the great and endle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings of the fini&s;hed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t are freely offered, and given to every penitent be|liver. There is &s;alvation in no other name. Let us, &s;irs come to God thro' him, for who&s;e &s;ake the father mercies heareth and accepteth &s;inners; pardons our num|berle&s;s offences, &s;aves us from the cur&s;es of the broken law and from the wrath to come, and will rai&s;e us to endle&s;s glory and felicity.</P>
<P>MAY we, my brethren, ardently a&s;pire after that ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s which is given to tho&s;e, unto whom a merciful God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s, the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the di|vine Saviour; for ble&s;&s;ed are they who&s;e iniquities are forgiven, who&s;e &s;ins are covered, and unto whom God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s. May we per&s;evere in faith and love and holy obedience, and thro' grace obtain admit|tance into the everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Sa|viour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to whom be all the glory of our &s;al|vation.</P>
<P>AMEN.</P>
