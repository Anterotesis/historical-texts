<HEAD>An Account of the Matter, Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT the earne&s;t reque&s;t of many enquiring minds, I have un|dertaken to pre&s;ent to the public the matter, form and man|ner, of a new and &s;trange Religion, that has lately taken place among many people, in the States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New York; and in pur&s;uing my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take the fol|lowing method.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I will pre&s;ent to view, the leaders and teach|ers, of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. I will &s;hew their manner of addre&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. I will &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evidence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P N="4">4. I will &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;hall &s;hew the directions which they give to the&s;e that come to them, to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P N="6">6. I will &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructions, on their adherents.</P>
<P N="7">7. I &s;hall &s;hew what this new religion is, as pointed out by &s;cripture te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="8">8. I &s;hall give &s;ome rea&s;ons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere &s;peculation, but by &s;orrowful experience.</P>
<P N="9">9. I &s;hall clo&s;e the whole, by a word of advice to mini&s;ters and people.</P>
<P>To return therefore according to my promi&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, to pre&s;ent to public view, the leaders and teachers of this new and &s;trange religion.</P>
<P>The whole number con&s;i&s;ts of five males and &s;even females; three of the males, and two females, profe&s;s to be perfect, or to have attained a &s;tate of perfection; the other &s;even not perfect yet, but very far advanced. This people are Europeans, a part of which came from England to New York in the year 1774, and lived at New York and Albany, and places adjacent, two years; and in the year 1776, the re&s;t came to Philadelphia, and travel|led through Penn&s;ylvania, to New York, where the whole twelve came together, and directly went and made a purcha&s;e of land, in a place called Ni&s;queunia, about nine or ten miles north we&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="017318_0004_103CECC45480B7E0">from Albany, where they immediately &s;ettled, and went to clear|ing their land, and following their &s;everal occupations, of black|&s;mithing, weaving and &s;hoe making, and were unknown and unnoticed, unle&s;s by a few of their neighbours, until the 17th day of April la&s;t; at which time, one Talmage Bi&s;hop brought ridings into New Lebanon, of a number of &s;trange and wonder|ful Chri&s;tians; the people, like the Athenians of old, were filled with de&s;ire to &s;ee new things, and run to &s;ee them. This brings me to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">2. Their manner of addre&s;s.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on goes to &s;ee them, they all meet him with many &s;miles, and &s;eeming great gladne&s;s; they bid him welcome, and directly tell him they knew of his coming ye&s;terday. This &s;ets the per&s;on a wondering at their knowledge, and pre&s;ently they get the per&s;on &s;ome victuals; then they &s;it down and have a &s;pell of &s;inging; they &s;ing odd tunes, and Briti&s;h marches, &s;ometimes without words, and &s;ometimes with a mixture of words, known and unknown. After &s;inging they fall to &s;haking their heads in a very extraordinary manner, with their eyes &s;hut and face up; then a woman about forty years old &s;its and makes a &s;ort of prayer, chiefly in an unknown tongue (if I may &s;o call it) then one of the men comes to the per&s;on, and pretends to interpret the woman's prayer; after which they tell the per&s;on he has come to the right place to be in&s;tructed; they enquire the per&s;on's name, and ever after call him by his Chri&s;tian name; they u&s;e no compliments, but their language is, yea and nay. If the per&s;on have long hair, or a club, they bring the bible, and read to him 1 Cor. xith chapter and 14th ver&s;e, then telling him if he intends to be in&s;tructed, he mu&s;t have his hair cut &s;hort; telling of him that he wears the mark of the bea&s;t. If he con|&s;ents to have his hair cut, after it is done they come round him, and touch him with their fingers here and there, and give him a fly cro&s;s, and in a very loving way, put their hands on his head, and then begin to preach their doctrine to him. But this leads me to enter on the third thing propo&s;ed, viz.</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;hew their doctrine, with the &s;cripture evidence they bring to prove it.</P>
<P>They introduce their doctrine with a multitude of good words; &s;aying we mu&s;t hate &s;in, love God, take up our cro&s;s, &amp;c. Then proceed to &s;ay in the fir&s;t place, that there is a new di&s;pen&s;ation
<PB N="5" REF="017318_0005_103CECC5F7656968">taking place, in which the &s;aints &s;hall reign a thou&s;and years with Chri&s;t, and that in that &s;tate the &s;aints &s;hall be perfect, and that they have entered into it, and that they are the only church in the world; telling the per&s;on or hearer, that they have all the apo&s;tolic gifts that were ever given; then they tell the per&s;on that he has come to the right place for in&s;truction, for they only are able to teach; then they pau&s;e a while to &s;ee how the per&s;on receives it, if they find he li&s;tens, and &s;eems to be coming, they proceed and &s;ay, all the churches now in the world are antichri&s;t, and fal&s;e churches, and that there is not one per&s;on born again among them all, and that there has not one gone to heaven for the&s;e twelve hundred years, no, not &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age. If the per&s;on makes any objections, they tell him he mu&s;t not di&s;|pute, his bu&s;ine&s;s is to hear and receive in&s;truction, and all hands will fall to confirming the truth of what is declared: This puts the per&s;on to &s;ilence, and then they proceed, with a great laugh, and tell him they have many things to &s;ay to him, which he is not yet able to bear; this is to engage the per&s;on to hear. Then, &s;econdly, they proceed to &s;ay, that all external ordinances, e&s;pecially bapti&s;m, and the Lord's &s;upper, cea&s;ed in the apo&s;tolic age; and that God has never &s;ent one man to preach, &s;ince the apo&s;tle's days, until they entered into the new di&s;pen&s;ation, and were &s;ent by God, from Great Britain, to call in God's elect; and to confirm the truth of what the teacher has &s;aid, he, the teacher, falls a trembling, and will &s;ay he feels the blood of Chri&s;t, now running down his thigh and leg. Then they tell the per&s;on he can't bear any more now, but he mu&s;t come again very &s;oon and they will tell him more; and thus they with many fawning embraces, part with him for that time.</P>
<P N="3">3. When he comes again they meet him with great joy, cla&s;p him in their arms, and tell him they have the great love of God; and after things are a little &s;ettled, they begin with him again, telling him that he mu&s;t confe&s;s his &s;ins to them, from his child|hood, that they may take his ca&s;e, and travail for him, that he may be born again. If he be a profe&s;&s;or of godline&s;s, and pleads that he hopes his &s;ins are forgiven, and wa&s;hed away by the blood of Chri&s;t; they tell him nay, they are not forgiven. They tell him, what&s;oever is done in &s;ecret, mu&s;t be revealed on the hou&s;e top: And that they being the church, are the hou&s;e top. Then one takes him alone, and if he confe&s;&s;es his &s;in to him,
<PB N="6" REF="017318_0006_103CECC7EEBC89E0">then he tells it to the re&s;t: But if it be &s;u&s;pected, that he keeps back part of his &s;in, he mu&s;t confe&s;s the whole, all being pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="4">4. They tell him, that they &s;ee angels, and conver&s;e with them, and hear them &s;ing, and &s;ing with them; and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, they al&s;o freely conver&s;e with. They further tell him, the &s;ong that they &s;ing, is the &s;ong of the hun|dred and forty and four thou&s;and, which no man can learn, but only tho&s;e that are redeemed from the earth. Then tell him, they have got a mother; pointing to a woman, one of their company: And that &s;he &s;peaks &s;eventy two tongues, and that when &s;he &s;peaks in unknown tongues, the living people cannot under&s;tand her; yet the dead under&s;tand her, for &s;he talks to them.</P>
<P N="5">5. They proceed and &s;ay, the judgment is &s;et, the books are opened, and the dead are now ri&s;ing, and coming to judgment, and they are &s;et to judge the world: Quoting 1 Cor. vi. chap. 2. ver&s;e. They tell the per&s;on, that the great tribunal is that church, and that the dead are coming before them every day, to be judged. They go on to &s;ay, all that have died in an imperfect &s;tate, have gone to hell, or to a pri&s;on &s;tate; and there to pay the debt to divine ju&s;tice, by &s;uffering; and that there are degrees of puni&s;h|ment, which they are to pa&s;s through; great &s;ins, a great degree of hell, &s;mall &s;ins, a &s;mall hell: And after pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;everal degrees of puni&s;hment, and paying the whole debt, out they come, and &s;tand before us (&s;ay they) and are acquitted, and go home to heaven; they quote for proof, P&s;al. xvi. 10. P&s;al. lxviii. 18. Ezekiel xvi. 44&mdash;61. 1 Peter iii. 18, 19, 20. 1 Peter iv. 6.</P>
<P>They comment on tho&s;e texts thus: Did Chri&s;t go to hell? Yes: When? Why, when he was crucified: What did he go there for? Why, to preach to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on. What did he preach to them? Why, the go&s;pel. Why did he preach the go&s;pel to the old world, or to the dead? Why, that they might be jud|ged, as unconverted &s;inners, but finally live, according to God, in the &s;pirit, after they have paid the debt in &s;uffering.</P>
<P N="6">6. They &s;ay, that the afore-recited woman, about forty years of age, is the woman &s;poken of in the xiith chapter of the Revela|tions of John, who was clothed with the &s;un, having the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve &s;tars; and that &s;he has travail'd and brought forth the man child. Fur|ther,
<PB N="7" REF="017318_0007_103CECC9F82DCA48">that &s;he is the mother of all the elect; and that &s;he travails for the whole world; and that no ble&s;&s;ing can come to any per|&s;on, but only by and through her; and that in the way of her being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;in, by their confe&s;&s;ing of them, and re|penting of the &s;ame, one by one, according to her direction.</P>
<P N="7">7. They hold them&s;elves &s;o far immortal, that they &s;hall never die, but &s;hall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and go from this to the upper regions; and that now, they are above all temptations and &s;ufferings, and can neither be li&s;ted up or ca&s;t down; only as they &s;uffer in travail for the elect. I might &s;till proceed much farther on this head; but as it will nece&s;&s;arily fall into their in&s;tructions to their adherents, I pa&s;s by it for the pre&s;ent, and &s;hall proceed,</P>
<P N="4">4. To &s;hew their manner of wor&s;hip (if it may be &s;o called.)</P>
<P>The manner and form of their wor&s;hip is entirely new, and different from all others: It differs but little on the Sabbath, from any other day: They begin by &s;itting down, and &s;haking their heads, in a violent manner, turning their heads half round, &s;o that their face looks over each &s;houlder, their eyes being &s;hut; while they are thus &s;haking, one will begin to &s;ing &s;ome odd tune, without words or rule; after a while another will &s;trike in; and then another; and after a while they all fall in, and make a &s;trange charm:&mdash;Some &s;inging without words, and &s;ome with an unknown tongue or mutter, and &s;ome with a mixture of En|gli&s;h: The mother, &s;o called, minds to &s;trike &s;uch notes as makes a concord, and &s;o form the charm. When they leave off &s;inging, they drop off, one by one, as oddly as they come on; in the be&s;t part of their wor&s;hip, every one acts for him&s;elf, and al|mo&s;t every one different from the other; one will &s;tand with his arms extended, acting over odd po&s;tures, which they call &s;igns; another will be dancing, and &s;ometimes hopping on one leg about the floor; another will fall to turning round, &s;o &s;wift that if it be a woman, her cloaths will be &s;o filled with the wind, as though they were kept out by a hoop; another will be pro&s;trate on the floor; another will be talking with &s;omebody; and &s;ome &s;itting by, &s;moaking their pipe; groaning mo&s;t di&s;mally; &s;ome trembling ex|tremely; others acting as though all their nerves were convuls'd; others &s;winging their arms, with all vigor, as though they were turn|ing a wheel, &amp;c. Then all break off, and have a &s;pell of &s;moaking, and &s;ometimes great &s;its of laughter. They have &s;everal &s;uch exer|ci&s;es
<PB N="8" REF="017318_0008_103CECCB84B49318">in a day, e&s;pecially on the Sabbath. When they go to eat, they &s;it down, and have a &s;pell of &s;inging and &s;haking the head at the table, before they eat, &s;ome times they kneel down, &s;hake their heads and groan, &s;ay nothing, and then fall to eating, and will be very merry and airy. If one has done eating before the re&s;t, he kneels down, &s;hakes his head a &s;pell, and off he goes and leaves the re&s;t eating; &s;o each one di&s;mi&s;&s;es the table for him&s;elf: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to point out any exact form; for they vary and differ and &s;eldom act the &s;ame form exactly over again. They chu&s;e &s;o to do, to be &s;ingular, le&s;t, as they &s;ay, they &s;hould be connected with Babylon. Every day their wor&s;hip is &s;imilar to what has been ob&s;erved. They have no public prayer, no preaching, and but little reading. Their actions in wor&s;hip is according to the dictates of the &s;pirit that governs them; then they profe&s;s, &s;aying, they are in a &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hown, as far as may be, their manner of wor&s;hip, I proceed, 5thly, to &s;hew the directions which they give to tho&s;e that come to them to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on goes to them to be in&s;tructed they enquire of him, whether he has given his vote and money for the defence of the country, and pre&s;ently tell him, it is contrary to the go&s;pel to bear arms, &s;aying Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world; they labour to convince him, that it is a great error to have any thing to do with war and fighting: They directly tell him, he is not born again, and that he mu&s;t ob&s;erve their in&s;tructions, in order that he may attain to the new birth. Then they tell him, he mu&s;t confe&s;s his &s;in to them; for if he hides his &s;in they can do nothing for him; they further tell him, if he refu&s;es, they can tell him all his &s;in that he ever committed; and pretend that he can keep nothing hid from them; and when they have frighten|ed him to a confe&s;&s;ion, then they tell him, he mu&s;t renounce and refrain from all the works of the fle&s;h; telling him that the fir&s;t fall of our fir&s;t parents, was carnal copulation, and that this ruined the world; and that every one that has any thing to do with man or woman, in the work of generation, is acting Adam and Eve's &s;in over again: They tell the man to ab&s;tain from his wife, and the woman from her hu&s;band; and that if the wife doth not agree to it, the hu&s;band mu&s;t put her away; and if the hu&s;band will not agree to it, the wife mu&s;t leave her hu&s;band; and for example, the mother, &s;o called, will tell how &s;he left her hu&s;|band,
<PB N="9" REF="017318_0009_103CECCD0AEC5F18">in New York, and one of the men, how he left his wife in England. They tell young men and young women, if they mar|ry, and have any thing to do with the works or lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, they can never be born again: They &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of re|ceiving this in&s;truction, by quoting Rev. iii. 3, 4, 5. They dwell more on this part of their in&s;tructions than all the re&s;t: They tell their adherents, if they conform to their in&s;tructions in this point, there is no fear of their being born again; but if they di&s;obey, they certainly will be damned. While they are thus in&s;tructing their adherents, they &s;ometimes u&s;e great &s;eve|rity, and &s;ometimes great flattery, to frighten on the one hand and allure on the other; and while they are thus at work with a per&s;on, they come round him, touch him with their fingers, in different places, cro&s;s him here and there, get their hand on his head, and prophecy, that great ble&s;&s;ings are laid up for him: They pre&s;ently make him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> them, and as &s;oon as they &s;ee the &s;pirit begin to operate on him, then they tell him, that now he has received the Holy Gho&s;t, and now if he di&s;obeys, it is a gone ca&s;e with him: They tell him, if he had never come to &s;ee them, and had died in his ignorance without receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, he would have gone to hell or a pri&s;on &s;tate, and &s;uffered a while, and then come out and gone to heaven; but now, if he turns back, there is no forgivene&s;s, neither in this world, nor that which is to come: They quote for proof, Matt. xii. 32. This is to terrify the per&s;on, and bring him into an ab&s;olute dependence on them: Then they tell him, he mu&s;t come often to them to be in&s;tructed, or he will be in danger of being taken by evil &s;pirits and led wrong; and that he mu&s;t not think he can under&s;tand the Bible. or know in any re&s;pect how to act, but only as he receives in&s;truction from them: They tell him, they have many things for him, which he is not yet able to bear; but as fa&s;t as he is able to receive it, they &s;hall in&s;truct him: Thus the per&s;on is kept in con&s;tant expectation of &s;omething new. If the per&s;on &s;eems to be &s;ober, then one takes him by the hand, and round the flour with him, and make him run and &s;kip about, and laugh heartily at him, and will tell him he mu&s;t not be melancholy; and when they get him merry with them, then let him go: Then they tell the per&s;on for his admiration, that &s;ince he has been pre&s;ent, they have had many of the dead come before them to be judged; and make him believe they
<PB N="10" REF="017318_0010_103CECCEB597D558">know his thoughts, and know future events, and nothing can be hid from them; telling how people are together, and talking about them, and what they &s;ay, &amp;c. Then they tell the per&s;on that they &s;hall never die, and al&s;o all tho&s;e that obey them, and get to be perfect, &s;hall never die, but be changed in a moment, and go home body and &s;oul: But all the bodies of tho&s;e that die in their &s;ins, &s;hall never ri&s;e. They further tell him, that the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which were &s;ealed; twelve thou&s;and out of each tribe, is a work yet to be done; and that they are of the tribe of Benjamin, though the younge&s;t tribe, and la&s;t in the account, yet fir&s;t in the order, of being &s;ealed; and that they are the fir&s;t fruits of that tribe; and that all that are to be brought in, in America, will belong to that tribe: And thus, the la&s;t is to be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t la&s;t.</P>
<P>I might &s;till proceed, on this head; but it would be needle&s;s, to repeat all their in&s;tructions, to their adherents, as they are ever &s;tudying new things, to keep up the dependence, and ad|miration of their di&s;ciples. I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s on,</P>
<P>6thly. To &s;hew the power and effect of their in&s;tructions, on their adherents.</P>
<P>There is a very extraordinary and uncommon power attends their in&s;tructions; in the fir&s;t place a total blindne&s;s, as to all their former views, of religion and the bible, on the in&s;tructed, takes place; and then a &s;trange infatuation of the mind to believe all their teachers &s;ay. Pre&s;ently, a &s;trange power begins to come on, and takes place in the body, or human frame, which &s;ets the per&s;on a gaping and &s;tretching; and &s;oon &s;ets him a twitching, as though his nerves were all in a convul&s;ion. I can compare it to nothing nearer in its feelings, than the operation of an electeri&s;ing machine; the per&s;on believes it is the power of God, and therefore dare not re&s;i&s;t, but wholly gives way to it. Thus the power comes on, more and more; and as the power increa&s;es, &s;o their faith increa&s;es, in their teachers. If any body oppo&s;es them, it brings on the power, quick, &s;trong and violent; and they cry out on the oppo&s;er, that he will be damn'd for oppo&s;ing the power of God; and fall to twitching and trembling, as though they had on extreme fit of the ague. This power as it increa&s;es, it brings on, many times, extreme weakne&s;s of body, &s;o that their limbs fail them, and they fall to the flour, or on the ground, and lie helple&s;s: At other times, it brings on great &s;hakings, and &s;hrug|ing

The power will take their hand, &s;tretch it up, pull the other down, they interpret it, the hand up is a &s;ign of mercy, the hand down of judgment: Sometimes their hand is &s;tretched out forward, then away they run after it; if it leads to &s;ome per|&s;on, they lay their hand on his head, then cro&s;s their arms one acro&s;s the other, then &s;ay he mu&s;t take up his cro&s;s and renounce the works of the fle&s;h, then they &s;tretch both hands behind them, and &s;ay he mu&s;t leave the world behind him; Sometimes their hands will be cramped up, one finger &s;tretched out &s;traight, another down into their hand, and their hand, all out of common &s;hape. Sometimes their hand will &s;tretch out, and after it they run, through woods, cro&s;s lots, over fences, &s;wamps or whatever, till they come to a hou&s;e; perhaps they will be &s;topt, &s;everal times in their cour&s;e, and their head turn them round, as though they had lo&s;t their way; then take a new &s;et off, and run again, per|haps when they get to the hou&s;e, they will lie down on the ground, make a round ring with their finger, among the dirt, pu&s;her about in it, then &s;tart up, double their fi&s;t at it, run away from it, come at it again, &s;how the looks of vengeance at it, threaten it with po&s;tures, then run and jump into it, and &s;tamp it all to pieces. This &s;ign they interpret to be the old heavens, which are to pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e. When he goes into the hou&s;e, he flutters round with his hands flying, and hi&s;&s;ing as if he intended to drive all the flies out of the room. But this, he &s;ays, is to hunt the evil &s;pirits out, which the hou&s;e is full of.</P>
<P>After he has done his errand, he follows his hand off, without a&s;king how they do, or bidding them farewell. When they meet together for their wor&s;hip, they fall a groaning and trembling, and every one acts alone for him&s;elf; one will fall pro&s;trate on the floor, another on his knees and his head in his hands, on the floor; another will be muttering over articulate &s;ounds, which neither they or any body el&s;e under&s;tand. Some will be &s;inging, each one his own tune; &s;ome without words, in an Indian tone, &s;ome &s;ing jigg tunes, &s;ome tunes of their own making, in an un|known mutter, which they call new tongues; &s;ome will be danc|ing,
<PB N="12" REF="017318_0012_103CECD21E2DC4E0">and others &s;tand laughing, heartily and loudly; others will be druming on the floor with their feet, as though a pair of drum-&s;tricks were beating a ruff on a drum head; others will be agoniz|ing, as though they were in great pain; others jumping up and down; others fluttering over &s;ome body, and talking to them; others will be &s;hooing and hi&s;&s;ing evil &s;pirits out of the hou&s;e, till the different tunes, groaning, jumping, dancing, druming, laughing, talking and fluttering, &s;hooting and hi&s;&s;ing, makes a perfect bedlam; this they call the wor&s;hip of God. They &s;peak highly of their teachers, and &s;ay tho&s;e men at Ni&s;queunia are the angels of God, &s;ent forth to gather in God's elect. Some of them &s;ay, that the woman called the mother, has the fullne&s;s of the God Head, bodily dwelling in her, and that &s;he is the queen of heaven, Chri&s;t's wife: And that all God's elect mu&s;t be born through her; yea, that Chri&s;t through her is born the &s;econd time. They &s;ay, that that church (as they call it) has power to &s;hut heaven, that it rain not, and to bring on all manner of plagues, as often as they will. They prophe&s;y that this go&s;pel (as they call it) mu&s;t be preached to all the world, and all tho&s;e that do not fall in with it will be damned. If any body oppo&s;es them, they get round him, threaten him with damnation, &s;torm and &s;tamp at him, &s;tare open their eyes, pucker up their mouths, and cry oh! oh! oh! at him, and act all the po&s;tures of ven|geance, which is enough to frighten a Hercules out of his wits.</P>
<P>Every one, as &s;oon as they fall in with this new religion, im|mediately throw down their arms, and cry out again&s;t the means of defence made u&s;e of again&s;t the common enemy, and appear the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate again&s;t all the proceedings of the country. I have heard &s;ome of them &s;ay, that all our authority, civil and military, is from hell, and would go there again. The effect of this &s;cheme is &s;uch, that men and their wives have parted, children ran away from their parents, and &s;ociety entirely broke up in neighbourhoods; it makes children deny and di&s;own their parents, and &s;ay they are full of devils. They are continually throwing out their cur&s;es on all that do not fall in with them; prophe&s;ying the de&s;truction of the country; declaring they belong to the kingdom of God, and at the &s;ame time, if they are a&s;ked whether they are born again, they will &s;ay nay. If any per&s;on goes to rea&s;on with them, they immediately put their fingers in their ears, or run off out of hearing, or el&s;e drown him with
<PB N="13" REF="017318_0013_103CECD3A38C6720">clamor, noi&s;e and cur&s;es: And as their teaches advi&s;e and order children to run away from parents, and men to &s;hut their doors again&s;t their own brethren, by blood, and refu&s;e them any ad|mi&s;&s;ion into their hou&s;es; all their orders are punctually obeyed.</P>
<P>They make great dependence on their &s;igns, and &s;ay it is the power of God, and God has taken that way to preach to them: One of them had a &s;ign, that a certain man had committed mur|der, and charged him with it, which the man denied; he again had a &s;ign, that a certain man intended to kill two children and their mother, on a certain night; then he had a &s;ign for two of his a&s;&s;ociates to go and lie all night behind the hou&s;e, and watch for him, and when they heard the children cry to ru&s;h in and take the man and bind him, and bring the man to him; the two men obeyed his orders, believing in his &s;ign; about break of day he had a &s;ign that they had catched the man and bound him; however, in the morning, the two men returned, having not &s;een the man. Thus their &s;igns in general, prove fal&s;e; however, they get out this way, that the &s;ign is true, but they made a fal&s;e in|terpretation. I knew another, who under the operation of the &s;pirit prophe&s;ied, that at the end of two weeks, New London would be de&s;troyed, and at the end of four weeks Albany would be burnt, and the next day the world would be at an end; all which proved fal&s;e. Another had a &s;ign, that a certain man, on &s;uch a day, would kill him, and on the third day he &s;hould ri&s;e again into life and action; which likewi&s;e proved fal&s;e. One of their po&s;tures which increa&s;e among them is, turning round, very &s;wift, for an hour, and &s;ometimes for two hours at a time, till they are all wet with &s;weat; this they &s;ay, is to &s;hew the great power of God.</P>
<P>They meet together in the night, and have been heard two miles by people, in the dead of the night; &s;ometimes a company of them will run away to &s;ome hou&s;e, get into it, rai&s;e a bedlam, wake up all in the hou&s;e, and the neighbours round about for a mile; They run about in the woods and el&s;ewhere, hooting and tooting like owls; &s;ome of them have &s;tripped naked in the woods, and thought they were angels, and invi&s;ible, and could go about among men and not be &s;een, and have lo&s;t their cloaths, and never found them again. Sometimes while eating at the table, they &s;ay their dead parents and brethren come on the table and &s;et on a pye and they &s;ee them, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017318_0014_103CECD5754D7E18">
At one of their meetings, they hung a woman by the neck, but took her down before &s;he was dead, to &s;hew as a &s;ign, how they were to be per&s;ecuted; and now while I am writing, I am in|formed, by good authority, that two men in the &s;cheme have mur|dered them&s;elves, one cut his throat, the other &s;tabbed him&s;elf, after he had twice tried to kill his wife, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might proceed much further, but it is as impo&s;&s;ible to fully &s;et forth the power and effects of this new religion, as to trace the airy road of the meteor: I therefore proceed, 7thly, to &s;hew what this new religion is as pointed out by &s;cripture te&s;timony.</P>
<P>In opening this propo&s;ition it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, on the great purpo&s;es of God, which will terminate in two grand events; fir&s;t, the deliverance of his people, and fulfilling his pro|mi&s;es to them: Secondly, the de&s;truction of the man of &s;in. The&s;e events will conclude and fini&s;h the reign of Antichri&s;t: And the work of God, in general, has a &s;pecial re&s;pect, both in his pro|vidence and grace, to the grand conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Every age of the church have had their trials and combats with the great enemy of God and his people; and as God's work and de&s;igns have advanced forward, &s;o the power of the enemy has increa&s;ed; and it is very evident, that the la&s;t &s;truggles of the enemy will be the mo&s;t powerful and dangerous; this God &s;aw, and in his great goodne&s;s has adverti&s;ed his people of the delu&s;ions and errors that would take place in the la&s;t days; knowing that the crafty &s;erpent would act over again, his &s;ubtil wiles, in the highe&s;t preten&s;ions of the greate&s;t good. We are informed by our Lord, in Matt. xxiv. 24. that fal&s;e Chri&s;ts and fal&s;e prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders, in&s;omuch that if it were po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould deceive the very elect.</P>
<P>This matter is more fully opened and illu&s;trated by the great apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, ii. 3&mdash;12. he gives advice, not to be deceived; for the day of Chri&s;t &s;hall not come, before there come fir&s;t a falling away; and that the man of &s;in be revealed, whom he calls the &s;on of perdition, who op|po&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped: So that he as God &s;itteth in the temple of God,&mdash;&s;hewing that he is God;&mdash;he &s;hews in the 7th ver&s;e, that it is the great mi&s;tery of iniquity, who&s;e coming &s;hall be after the working of &s;atan, with all power, and &s;igns and lying wonders,
<PB N="15" REF="017318_0015_103CECD7A1E7D328">with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. As this great delu&s;ion is to take place in the la&s;t days, before the coming of Chri&s;t, we are charged by our Lord to watch, we are therefore to watch the &s;igns of his coming, and to watch the motions of the my&s;tery of iniquity, which if well attended to, it will appear mo&s;t evident, that this is the day in which we may expect to &s;ee &s;atan, in the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t delu&s;ive machinations, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a &s;hort time. Rev. xii. 12. And while men are looking for the great revolution, or change of times to take place, when Chri&s;t &s;hall reign in and with his church a thou&s;and years;&mdash;&s;atan finds it the mo&s;t &s;it &s;ea&s;on to pre&s;ent a counterfeit, dre&s;t in the highe&s;t colours of &s;anctity and holine&s;s; and as many expect to &s;ee new things take place in the millenium &s;tate; &s;o &s;atan improves his advantage on &s;uch, by pre&s;enting new religion, new laws, new modes and forms, new churches, new preaching, new doctrine, new views, new di&s;coveries, new &s;pirit, new bibles, or &s;een in a new light, new heaven and new glory.&mdash;And that all old things are to pa&s;s away, no more old religion, no more old modes and forms, old churches, old preaching and doctrine are to cea&s;e; old views, old experiences and old conver&s;ion to be rejected; old friend&s;hip, old relations, and old love to be known no more. And while the plea&s;ing picture by the arch enemy is pre&s;ented to view, it finds many admirers.</P>
<P>It is very evident, that this is the very day in which this work of &s;atan is on the wheel: And notwith&s;tanding, it may appear unaccountable to every rational mind, that any of the human &s;pecies &s;hould fall in with &s;o diabolical a &s;cheme; yet when we con&s;ider its fine dre&s;s of perfection, and the &s;pirit of infatuation, and witchcraft, that attends it, it may form our minds into a belief, that it can be and really is &s;o.</P>
<P>It is very evident, that Antichri&s;t cannot appear in any other light or path, but only that which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles has marked out for it.&mdash;I will therefore compare the works and cha|racter of Antichri&s;t with this new and &s;trange religion, as it is delineated and &s;et forth.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Paul, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, iii. 1&mdash;9. points out this very people, in this new religion, and &s;hew they were to appear in the la&s;t days, bearing the character of God's enemies. Again, in 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. The Holy
<PB N="16" REF="017318_0016_103CECD9476CF0A0">Gho&s;t points out the doctrines of this new religion, and calls them the doctrines of devils, which are taught them by &s;educing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. Again, 2. Peter, ii. 1, 2, 3. There here&s;ies are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and of their denying the Lord that bought them. No|thing is mere evident, then that the apo&s;tle points out this very people, for they throw away their conver&s;ion and begin to repent of their &s;in which they committed in their childhood; and thus to atone and make &s;atisfaction, and &s;tep up the ladder of their own works, into a &s;tate of perfection; but if death &s;hould over|take them before they get to be perfect, then down to hell they mu&s;t go, to pay the remainder in &s;uffering, and when they have paid the debt and are born again in hell, then to come out and go to heaven; will they thank Chri&s;t, as the great mediator, and adore him, for his atoning blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s? No, not at all; Oh, dreadful &s;cheme, that &s;tands oppo&s;ed to the glorious plan of redemption by Chri&s;t: Well might Peter and Jude &s;ay of them, wells without water, clouds without rain, twice dead, pluckt up by the roots, wandering &s;tars, for whom is re&s;erved the black|ne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever. Again,</P>
<P>I find this new religion differs from the true religion of the go&s;|pel, re&s;pecting faith.</P>
<P>I find go&s;pel religion &s;ays, being ju&s;tified by faith, Rom. v. 1. but this new religion &s;ays by works. To decide this matter, I &s;hall attend to the apo&s;tle, in Rom. iv. 4, 5. where he &s;ays, "to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt; but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s." The true chri&s;tian &s;ees by faith, lives by faith, walks by faith, fights the good fight of faith, and gets the victory by faith: But the people in this new religion, do not &s;o much as talk about faith in Chri&s;t; but they place their whole knowledge in their religion, on their pretended vi&s;ions, prophe&s;ies and &s;igns. Another thing which proves this new religion to be fal&s;e, is what follows: The apo&s;tle James, in his epi&s;tle, i. 5. &s;ays, "If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth liberal|ly." But this people go to Ni&s;queunia, to a&s;k of a number of Europeans, what they &s;hall do, who tell them, agreeable to what I find 2 Peter, ii. 18, 19. They &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity, and allure through their much wantonne&s;s, tho&s;e that were clean e&s;caped, from them who live in error; and while
<PB N="17" REF="017318_0017_103CECDACCD68F60">they promi&s;ed them liberty, they them&s;elves are the &s;ervants of corruption. And further, in&s;tead of attending to the worthy in|&s;tructions of our godly teachers, they are burning all the books of divinity and learning they come at. In this new religion, in the whole magazine of error, trea&s;ured up in the great my&s;tery of iniquity, in which is found all the power of delu&s;ive witch|craft, to blindfold &s;ouls, and lead them to hell. I might cite a multitude of &s;cripture in proof of this point, but &s;hall only &s;ay the whole cannon of God's word, is levelled again&s;t this new re|ligion, and doth and will eternally condemn it, and all its pro|pagators &s;hall not be able to &s;tand the trial; with which I clo&s;e this head, and proceed,</P>
<P>8thly, To give &s;ome rea&s;ons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere &s;peculation, but &s;orrowful experience.</P>
<P>On the 13th day of May la&s;t, I received a reque&s;t from a church at Stillwater, above Albany, to attend on a conference, the 25th day of the &s;ame month: and being di&s;po&s;ed to go, two of my brethren offered to bear me company, provided I would re|turn back by the way of Ni&s;queunia with them, to &s;ee a new and &s;trange people living there. I con&s;ented to their propo&s;ition, in con&s;equence of their company in my journey, and on the 26th day of May la&s;t we arrived at Ni&s;queunia; the Europeans, tho' &s;trangers, received us very kindly, and pre&s;ently told us they knew of our coming the day before; this &s;et me a wondering at their knowledge. After they had got us &s;ome victuals, one of them came and &s;at down by me, and began to &s;peak many good words, &s;aying, I mu&s;t hate &s;in, love God, and take up my cro&s;s, &amp;c. then went on to tell about a new di&s;pen&s;ation, and that they had got into it; his words &s;eemed to be &s;o well placed, that I heard them with attention: Mean while a man, one of their company, &s;tands up before me, and began to &s;tretch and bend, and extend his arms up and down, and to act all manner of po&s;|tures, and turn his eyes almo&s;t in &s;ide out; I had never &s;een or heard of &s;uch actions before, and it &s;et me a wondering what he meant. By this time my mind was much engaged, attending to one that &s;poke good words, and to the other that acted &s;o oddly. Mean while, he that &s;poke drew near to me, and every little while would touch me with his finger; but I thought it was that I might mind well what he &s;aid; he likewi&s;e would give me a &s;ly cro&s;s, and put his hand on my head or about me, which I
<PB N="18" REF="017318_0018_103CECDC9D07E280">took not much notice of. The mother, &s;o called, looked very &s;miling, came and &s;at down, and began to &s;ing a &s;trange tune, with a my&s;tical voice, in a mixture of words, known and un|known, which &s;eemed to be a perfect charm.</P>
<P>After they had been the object of attention for &s;ome time, I turned my thoughts on my former views of religion, and found, to my admiration, my mind was turned wholly up&s;ide down; and began to think I had been all my life in a dream about reli|gion. After a further di&s;covery of their wor&s;hip, I felt greatly &s;hocked and confounded; yet a &s;ecret belief kept prevailing, that they were the people of God. I tarried all night, but &s;at up, hearing and &s;eeing tho&s;e &s;trange things till the break of day, in which time they gave me a hint of their purgatory &s;cheme, which greatly &s;hocked my mind: In this tumult of thought I left them in the morning, about eight o'clock, and returned home.</P>
<P>In a very &s;hort time I found a power come on me, different from whatever I had felt before, and made me feel weak and maugre, and in a little time it &s;o affected my nerves, that they gave a twitch, as &s;udden as a fla&s;h of lightening; at fir&s;t I thought what can that be? But immediately the an&s;wer was ready; it is the power of God: This made me give way to it, daring not to re&s;i&s;t it, and immediately it gave me another twitch; it had this effect on me, to make me attend to the power, and in &s;o doing I thought I attended on God: It never brought me to what they call &s;igns, and to &s;o great a &s;haking as &s;ome have; however, I reconciled my difficulties as well as I could, by concluding, that in the new di&s;pen&s;ation, new things would appear, and greater light would &s;hine, and whatever was wanting in my old experience would now appear; yet &s;o far as they went they might be good; yet many told me, I would ever be weak in the new, till I threw away all the old.</P>
<P>I went again to Ni&s;queunia and received further in&s;truction from the Europeans, and &s;eemed to be more confirmed. Having given them a relation of my life, they made me many large pro|mi&s;es of very great ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;till I remained under the ope|ration of the &s;pirit. But in a little time the effect of this new work in many, appeared &s;o wild, that it troubled me much, and I thought it my duty to &s;ever between the precious and the vile; which when I began to do, they ro&s;e upon me with a di&s;mal hi&s;s, and had a &s;ign to &s;top me; however, I went through again&s;t their
<PB N="19" REF="017318_0019_103CECDECE648260">&s;igns; and as the work went on, more incon&s;i&s;tencies and fal&s;e|hoods appeared, which made me repeat a rejection of &s;uch things, and made mention of &s;ome imperfections I had &s;een in their teachers; this made them ri&s;e in &s;uch a clamour, hi&s;s and uproar, as though the infenal den had broke loo&s;e: This gave me &s;uch a &s;hock, that I could go no further till I had examined the &s;cheme over again. For this purpo&s;e I attended to my bible more care|fully, and my eyes began to be opened, and the power on me began to decrea&s;e; but had great threatnings &s;ent to me from the teachers and others, telling me if I turned back, damnation was my portion. Their prophe&s;ies and their &s;igns appeared more and more fal&s;e, which &s;till opened my eyes, and gave me great jea|lou&s;y, that this new religion was led by a fal&s;e &s;pirit, and in a little time the operation wholly left me; my eyes were wide open, and I was as though I had come out of a dark cellar, into the brighte&s;t beams of the noon day &s;un.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;pirit which leads on this new &s;cheme, is the &s;pirit of witchcraft, and is the mo&s;t powerful of any delu&s;ion I ever heard or read of, except what I find in Acts viii. 9, 10, 11. If I have been in any mea&s;ure a means of leading any per&s;on into this wicked and dreadful delu&s;ion, I am very &s;orry, and as I heartily repent of my folly, I a&s;k the forgive|ne&s;s of all, e&s;pecially tho&s;e, that like my&s;elf, have been attending to creatures in&s;tead of looking to God.</P>
<P>Having thus given a &s;hort, but true relation, of this new reli|gion, in its &s;everal parts, together with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> real and ab&s;olute knowledge of the &s;ame, by &s;orrowful experience, I pa&s;s on to the 9th, and la&s;t propo&s;ition, viz.

<P>THERE never was a day that more loudly called for faith|ful watchmen, than the pre&s;ent time; while we &s;ee Satan trans|forming him&s;elf into an angel of light, and bringing forward his doup laid &s;cheme, to undermine the glorious plan of redemption by Chri&s;t: And as he at fir&s;t deceived the woman, and made u&s;e of her to delude the man; &s;o he is playing his old prank over again, &s;ending one woman from the &s;tate of New York, and ano|ther from the State of Rhode I&s;land (Jemima Wilkin&s;on) who vic with each other, and are as dangerous to the heedle&s;s pa&s;&s;enger, as Scylla and Charybdes are to the un&s;kilful mariner. O then I what need is there of &s;kilful pilo's and experienced helm&s;men, to &s;teer the &s;hip of Zion and keep her in the true channel of faith and love to God.</P>
<P>The battle is now begun, Michael and his angels, and the dra|gon and his angels, are now formed one again&s;t the other, for the grand deci&s;ion. Now we may expect the whole artillery of the in|fernal den, charged with error, delu&s;ion and bla&s;phemy, attended with all the power of helli&s;h fury, in the la&s;t &s;truggle of the enemy.</P>
<P>Now therefore, you are to fight again&s;t all the powers of dark|ne&s;s, and with&s;tand Satan, not only in his malignant rage and envy, but al&s;o in his deceitful flatteries and counterfeit friend&s;hip. For the old enemy of God and his people, like a grand politician, will try every method, by power, fraud and lies, to carry his dia|bolical de&s;igns into execution. You need therefore the whole armour of God, that you may be able to with&s;tand, and having
<PB N="21" REF="017318_0021_103CECE21E52C588">done all to &s;tand; but there is no fear to them that put their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in Chri&s;t, who will again come up from the fields of Edom, glo|rious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength, and will trample his enemies in his fury, and &s;prinkle his gar|ments with the blood of his enemies. You know your leader and where your great &s;trength lies; it is your duty to attend clo&s;ely to his directions, that you may be powerful in your war|fare, to pull down the &s;trong holds of &s;in and &s;atan, and in &s;o doing &s;ave your&s;elves and them that hear you, and at la&s;t receive a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give at that day.</P>
<P>Dear Fathers in Chri&s;t, Lclo&s;e my addre&s;s to you, by wi&s;hing you the ble&s;&s;ings of God in your pious labours to promote religion and virtue, and the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom. I commend you to God, and the power of his grace, who is able to make you &s;ucce&s;sful in building up your churches in the mo&s;t holy faith, and at la&s;t to give you all an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>I now turn my&s;elf to the people in general. My dear country|men, I am deeply affected at the fearful omens of impending de|&s;truction that &s;o loudly threaten our bleeding land. Surely God is angry, and the tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure are plainly di&s;covered; It is a day that calls for lamentation and mourning, repentance and reformation; it is for our &s;in that God has permitted the &s;word to be un&s;heathed upon us; and tyranny to clank its chains and threaten us with &s;lavery. Notwith&s;tanding it was our duty to look to God for help, and in an humble dependence on him, to &s;tand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in our defence, again&s;t a cruel enemy; yet how has our armies degenerated into nur&s;eries of impiety, and the conta|gious di&s;temper that we have been oppo&s;ing, &s;pread it&s;elf in our land? Vice and immorality abounds; &s;tupidity and profanene&s;s prevails; ambition and di&s;cord has been a growing evil; and how many of our countrymen, lo&s;t to the tender feelings of the human heart, been found more cruel than the O&s;trich. How many traiterous plans have been formed for our blood and trea&s;ure, by a banditti of infernal mi&s;creants? And notwith&s;tanding God has prevented, and his good providence bla&s;ted the de&s;igns of tho&s;e Cains and Judas's, that have combined again&s;t us, yet how have we forgot the danger, without being &s;ound in &s;uitable returns to God.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="017318_0022_103CECE3E4DF0A88">
The great enemy of God that has filled the world with uproar, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and death, has ever envied the recovery of man, by a glori|ous Mediator; and has ever been trying to circumvent the mer|ciful de&s;igns of God, through Chri&s;t, for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in addition to all his &s;ubtle wiles, he takes the advantage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> great decay of religion and virtue, and makes it his opportun|ity to play the magic games, attended with the doctrine of pur|gatory, the wor&s;hip of the creature in&s;tead of the Creator, and an earthly and creature tribunal, to bring the whole creation of men to trial. The &s;cheme is &s;o maked and ball'd, with all its &s;plendid &s;hew of perfection, that every rational mind would recoil at the thought of falling in with &s;uch a diabolical plan, was it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> power that attends it, which turns every thing up&s;ide down, and puts darkne&s;s for light, error for truth, bitter for &s;weet, and hell for heaven.</P>
<P>Multitudes have fallen in with this dreadful &s;cheme, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> infatuated in their &s;en&s;es, that they are deprived of their rea&s;on, and pa&s;t recovery, unle&s;s God interpo&s;e for them. While the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of this dreadful cata&s;trophe, like the bowels of Aetna, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> vomiting up their &s;ulpher; like wild fire it flies, and catches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> a di&s;tance, and &s;preads like a plague. For &s;uch a delu&s;ion to take place in the land, loudly proclaims the judgment of God. For a people to be carried away with the power of error, be&s;peaks their great darkne&s;s and ignorance of the truth.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, &s;uffer me to addre&s;s you with a word of advice. One great end and de&s;ign of this piece is to timely adverti&s;e you of the growing evils that are prevailing in our land, e&s;pecially the fatal delu&s;ion &s;et forth in this narrative Con|&s;ider the great and noble end of your creation. You were not made to be the meer play things of time, nor to furni&s;h Satan with materials to carry on his dark de&s;igns and horrid intrigues again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, but to honour and glorify God. There|fore, for this great end and purpo&s;e, break off from &s;in of every kind, encourage religion and virtue in each other; carefully at|tend to the doctrine and advice of your godly teachers; lift up your hearts in your de&s;ires to God, for his holy &s;pirit to enlighten and lead you into the truth; clo&s;ely attend to the word of God; make it the man of your coun&s;el. Let all your conduct &s;peak your belief of the Deity, and judgment to come; and by being a holy we &s;hall be a happy people, and &s;hall &s;ee the return of God's
<PB N="23" REF="017318_0023_103CECE58C44AFA0">ble&s;&s;ings, Satan di&s;appointed and bla&s;ted, and the glorious kings dom of Chri&s;t advancing. I clo&s;e my addre&s;s to you, by heartily recommending to your &s;erious con&s;ideration the great duty of guarding again&s;t tho&s;e dangerous errors, and delu&s;ions, which lead the mi&s;guided &s;oul into the endle&s;s mazes and winding laby|rinths of trouble and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>And may God pre&s;erve you and lead you to him&s;elf, through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; with which I clo&s;e, and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf the public's real friend, and humble &s;ervant,</P>
