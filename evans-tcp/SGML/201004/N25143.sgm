<HEAD>ALTORF.</HEAD>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of July 1796, the French army, in two columns, drew nigh to the Au&s;trian territories in Suabia; and upon the third of Augu&s;t the advanced guard of the right wing of the army of the Rhine and Mo&s;elle, commanded by brigadier gene|ral Abat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cci, appeared before Altorf, the chief town of the Au&s;trian government; whil&s;t the general of divi&s;ion Ferino (who before the revolution had been a &s;ubaltern officer in the Imperial regiment of Bender) advanced at the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the main body to|wards Aulenderf, and the column under the command of the general of divi&s;ion Tarreau, marched towards the lake of Con|&s;tance, and &s;pread it&s;elf over the adjacent country. The num|ber of per&s;ons in the Au&s;trian territory, who con&s;idered the French as a &s;ort of demi-gods, come to deliver them from fanci|ed ills, and from all the duties of a &s;ubject, and to procure them the enjoyment of the mo&s;t unbridled liberty and equality. was far from incon&s;iderable; and the neighbouring towns di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of a di&s;po&s;ition but too favourable to the enemy, and prej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dicial to the imperial army. But the appearance of the French in their own undi&s;gui&s;ed form, and the barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous exce&s;&s;es whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> announced and accompani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d their intentions, by b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">traying thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> real views, cau&s;ed a &s;peedy change in the &s;entiments of the pea&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">try, in which they were &s;oon joined by the inhabitants of the towns.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="033325_0004_0FF6C64D33EAF848">
Upon the 4th of Augu&s;t, Ferino required from the town of Altorf a pre&s;ent of 300 louis for him&s;elf and the officers of his &s;taff, for which he promi&s;ed his future protection to that place and its inhabitants. In like manner Tarreau extorted 125 louis from five &s;mall villages, whil&s;t his worthy colleague Stouhlen, the commi&s;&s;ary at war, at the &s;ame time impo&s;ed the mo&s;t exor|bitant contributions of provi&s;ions and clothing, the greater part of which he &s;old, and then exacted the delivery of &s;imilar arti|cles. Such oppre&s;&s;ive conduct, joined to the ravages of the &s;ol|diery and their inhuman treatment of the inhabitants, &s;o enraged the pea&s;antry, that they took up arms to oppo&s;e force by force, and &s;ome villagers actually attacked a detachment of 30 men be|longing to the brigade of general Rou&s;&s;eau, who had, during their march, committed a variety of exce&s;&s;es, and of whom they killed five, wounded &s;everal, and put the re&s;t to flight. Upon the 8th of Augu&s;t this account was brought to that general, who was then at Altorf, and who ordered the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch to be made for the ringleaders, when &s;ix pea&s;ants were brought before him, and every one trembled for their lives, and the &s;afety of the village. But Rou&s;&s;eau acted with more humanity and ju&s;tice than perhaps any other general in the French army would have done on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; for after confining the pea&s;ants during &s;everal days, he reckoned as part of their puni&s;hment their con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of approaching death, and di&s;charg|ed them, after requiring and receiving an oblation of 200 louis, which were readily given to him, with great admiration of his lenity.</P>
<P>The prudence and activity of the chief magi&s;trate had &s;aved Altorf from much oppre&s;&s;ion, and its &s;uture &s;ecurity was thought to be en&s;ured by the appearance of an Imperial detachment upon the 29th of September, which was received with the greate&s;t joy by the inhabitants, when their hopes were mo&s;t cruelly di&s;ap|pointed by a dreadful engagement upon the following day. For the Au&s;trian general Klingling, at the head of 2400 men, hav|ing taken a po&s;ition in the neighbourhood of Altorf, and his ad|vanced guard having repul&s;ed a patrole of &s;ixty French Hu&s;&s;ars, this &s;kirmi&s;h gave time for the main body of the French under general Ferino to advance, when the engagement &s;oon became &s;erious and general, and the Au&s;trains having planted their artil|lery upon a hill &s;outh of the town, the French in three columns, to the number of 10, 000. pu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed forward in fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of the battery and of a tremendous cannonade with &s;uch vigour, that the Au&s;trians were under the nece&s;&s;ity of retreating. Still
<PB N="7" REF="033325_0004_0FF6C64D33EAF848">however they continued to engage with great bravery in the &s;treets of Altorf, upon the neighboring heights, and within the walls of the Benedict ac abbey of Weingarten, in hopes that they &s;hould be reinforced by general Mercantin according to the plan which had been arranged. But &s;uch were the force and &s;ituation of the French army that general Mercantin was not even able to inform Klingling of the ob&s;tacles which prevented the intended junction; and to this is to be attributed the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>The abbey &s;uffered &s;everely, both during and after the engage|ment; for 500 of the enemy, burning with rage, and greedy of plunder, ru&s;hed into the convent, rifled every coffer and every clo&s;et, ran&s;acked every room from the garret to the cellar, de|&s;troyed the greate&s;t part of the furniture, beat and wounded the prie&s;ts and their attendants, robbed them of the money in their pockets, and carried away all the plate, linen, cloth, leather, and other articles, exclaiming, that it was their lawful booty. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the &s;ame were carrying on in the town of Altorf, and many hou&s;es were pillaged, even during the engagament. But this was only a prelude to greater and conti|nued per&s;ecution; for during five long and &s;orrowful days were the town and convent abandoned to the extortion of the com|mi&s;&s;aries and officers, and to the exce&s;&s;es and rapacity of the &s;ol|diers. It &s;eemed as if hell had opened and di&s;charged upon Al|torf its mo&s;t reprobate and execrable demons; for there is no enormity, however horrible, that was not perpetrated during tho&s;e painfully memorable days.</P>
<P>The troops had no &s;ooner quitted the abbey, than the com|mi&s;&s;aries appeared there for the purpo&s;e of plundering in the name of the French republic, by exacting the mo&s;t unheard of contri|butions, which were extorted by force of arms, and under me|naces of conflagration and the &s;word. The whole &s;tock of corn, of different kinds, all the cattle, all the wine and &s;pirits, and, in &s;hort, all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, were ordered to be delivered, either at the camp or into the hands of tho&s;e privileged locu&s;ts. One loaded waggon &s;ucceded another, conveying away the plun|der; and at la&s;t, the empty ca&s;ks, &s;acks, and common hou&s;e|hold furniture, were carried off, the hor&s;es were &s;tolen out of the fields, many of the articles were &s;old or wantonly de&s;troyed, and others were in&s;i&s;ted upon in their &s;tead. The fury of the&s;e banditti increa&s;ed in proportion as their booty was dimini&s;hed by their numerous thefts; and under pretence of &s;earching for hid|den trea&s;ure and concealed arms, they were guilty of the mo&s;t barbarous exce&s;&s;es. Whoever refu&s;ed to part with the &s;hirt upon
<PB N="8" REF="033325_0005_0FF6C64EED918318">his back was con&s;idered as a con&s;pirator again&s;t the French Re|public, accu&s;ed of not being a good patriot, and cruelly beaten, or maimed with a broad &s;word; and the prelate of the abbey was upon the point of being hanged whil&s;t on his way to intreat the clemency of the commander in chief, and was &s;aved only by the timely interference of an officer, who was more than commonly humane.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t night after the engagement, &s;ome of the &s;oldiers purpo&s;ely and wantonly &s;et fire to two hou&s;es in the town, and would not permit any attempts to be made to quench the flames. Several other hou&s;es were more than half con&s;umed by fire, in con&s;equence of their &s;cattering red hot coals and burning candles about the rooms, under the beds and among&s;t every heap of combu&s;tibles they could di&s;cover, &s;o that nothing but the great vigilance and exertions of the proprietors could have prevented the entire de&s;truction of the town.</P>
<P>When Altorf was reduced to &s;uch poverty as to afford no further temptation to the pillagers, they &s;pread them&s;elves in bands over the &s;urrounding country, attacked the cottages and habitations of the pea&s;antry (to whom they had promi&s;ed liberty, equality and affluence) rifled their pockets, de&s;troyed their fur|niture, tore up the floors of their rooms, cut open the mattre&s;&s;es and feather beds, dug up the ground in the cellars and gardens, turned over even the contents of the privies, in hopes of finding &s;ome concealed trea&s;ure, returned &s;ix or &s;even times to the &s;ame hou&s;es, and never quitted them until they had left nothing behind them but the bare walls. Oxen, cows and &s;wine, were either driven off, cut in pieces upon the &s;pot; or left cruelly mutilated; gee&s;e and poultry were carried away either dead or alive; and &s;uch provi&s;ions as could not either be con&s;umed or conveyed away were trodden under foot, or mixed with &s;and, a&s;hes and ordure; nor did the&s;e ruffians &s;pare even the &s;tores of bread, which it is u&s;ual in that country to keep dried for con&s;umption in the winter. Many cellars were left half full of wine, which had run from the ca&s;ks they had wantonly &s;taved; and the hou&s;es were long after|wards impregnated with the vapour of the brandy which they had poured about the rooms in the mo&s;t wa&s;teful manner. They de&s;troyed even the milk-pails and the appendages of the dairy; and in many dwellings there was not even a bench or a chair un|broken. The pea&s;ants were &s;ometimes threatened with imme|diate death, and &s;ometimes put to extreme torture, in order to procure a di&s;covery of money and other valuables, which they were accu&s;ed of having concealed; and many were &s;everely wound|ed
<PB N="9" REF="033325_0005_0FF6C64EED918318">and crippled, either by mu&s;ket balls, blows with the but ends of the firelocks, or &s;trokes of the broad &s;word. The deepe&s;t and mo&s;t apparent poverty was not even a protection again&s;t them; for beggars were &s;tripped of their rags; and the num|ber of tho&s;e who were left without a &s;hirt upon their back is by no means incon&s;iderable. Grey hairs and li&s;ping infancy, the &s;ick, the dying, and even women in labour, were alike expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t inhuman treatment, and were dragged from their beds, kicked about, and frequently wounded, under pretence that they were the keepers of concealed trea&s;ure. The women and chil|dren, who att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpted to e&s;cape, were pur&s;ued, plundered, and vio|lated: and girls from ten to twelve years of age were deprived of their innocence and health by the&s;e republican barbarians. Nei|ther age nor infirmity, nor yet the mo&s;t offen&s;ive di&s;orders, were able to &s;et bounds to their more than brutal lu&s;t; and ten, twelve, and even twenty of the&s;e depraved wretches are known &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly to have gratified their pa&s;&s;ions with the &s;ame object, whil&s;t their flamele&s;s colleagues either kept guard at the door, or held loaded pi&s;tols and fixed bayonets at the head of the unhappy &s;ufferer. Even in the infirmary near Weingarten did the&s;e cannibals com|mit the &s;ame horrid crimes, and outrage per&s;ons &s;uffering under the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting maladies, and &s;uch as preclude them from communication with the re&s;t of mankind. But delicacy forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o part of the character of the French republican; for at Heiden|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">im they u&s;ed as &s;pits for their meat the iron &s;pikes upon which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey had found the heads of &s;ome lately executed malefactors, and made their fire with the wheels upon which the corp&s;es had been expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. Even the bodies of young women, who had ex|pired under their barbarity, and of women who but a few hours before had been in labour, were made u&s;e of to &s;atiate the infer|nal lu&s;t of the&s;e mon&s;ters in human &s;hape, degraded far beneath the bea&s;ts of the field. With menaces of &s;laughter, with blows, with un&s;heathe &s;abres, and with loaded mu&s;kets, they enforced univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and dreadful was their revenge when their inclinations were re&s;i&s;ted. Whil&s;t they were plundering, de&s;troy|ing, di&s;honouring, and committing &s;uch exce&s;&s;es as humanity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udders to relate, at the village of Ingoldingen, from the &s;econd to the fourth of October, &s;ix or eight volunteers ru&s;hed into the lou&s;e of Jacob Fru&s;t, a farmer, who&s;e wife they ill treated, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">atened with in&s;tant death if &s;he refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to their de&s;ires; but that re&s;olute woman declaring that &s;he had rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eet death than di&s;honour, attacked the ruffians, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er hu&s;band, who fortunately came in, drove them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the
<PB N="10" REF="033325_0006_0FF6C650DDCE91C8">hou&s;e. Determined however to revenge them&s;elves, they &s;et fire to the dwelling, which, with the furniture, granary, and every thing but the cattle, became a prey to the flames. Three other hou&s;es met a &s;imilar fate, and the damages fu&s;tained by this and an adjoining village amounted in contributions and in lo&s;&s;es by plunder and conflagration, to the &s;um of 44, 824 florins, or above &pound;. 4, 000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>Not a trace of decency, not the lea&s;t regard to religion and its cu&s;toms, appeared in the conduct of the French &s;oldiery. In the churches they broke open the pyx, trampled the ho&s;t under foot, carried away the communion plate and the robes of the prie&s;ts, de&s;troyed the crucifixes and other images, and treated with ignominy every thing that is deemed holy by the catholic, and re&s;pected by the well meaning man of every religion.

<P>Upon the &s;econd of Augu&s;t 1796, a divi&s;ion of the column under the orders of general Ferino marched through this village, when &s;ome cha&s;&s;eurs belonging to the advanced guard entered a &s;hop, and forcibly took &s;ilk handkerchiefs and other goods to the value of 100 florins, for which they offered &s;ome a&s;&s;ignats in payment; but upon the &s;hopkeeper refu&s;ing to take &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s paper, they &s;truck at him with their &s;abres, and left the &s;hop with &s;houts of laughter and torrents of abu&s;e. Five others en|tered the hou&s;e of one of the magi&s;trates, loudly a&s;king for wine and victuals, with which they were &s;peedily and amply &s;erved, and for which they te&s;tified their gratitude by robbing their en|tertainer of his watch and money. The &s;ame night they threat|ened an inhabitant with death for telling an officer who wanted to put his carriage into his barn, that there was no room for it; and his life was with difficulty &s;aved by a magi&s;trate, who had him conveyed to the town pri&s;on, (as a place of &s;afety for the enemy) under promi&s;e that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>

<P>If the rough and barbarous manner in which the&s;e armed ruf|fians extorted what they wanted excited terror and dete&s;tation, their intemperance gave ri&s;e to an equal degree of a&s;toni&s;hment; for two Frenchmen would devour at a meal as much as would &s;erve three hard working Germans during three or four days; and between the hours of two and nine, they would frequently have three complete meals, which they generally moi&s;tened with whole rivers of wine, plentifully &s;weetened with &s;ugar, and u&s;ually &s;trengthened with cherry brandy.</P>
<P>Pfullendorf and the adjacent villages, &s;uffered however, but little, in compari&s;on with other places, until the enemy began to retreat, when the French not only carried away or de&s;troyed all the forage and corn they could find, but &s;o entirely demoli&s;hed a &s;mall hamlet in the neighbourhood, by breaking the windows, forcing open the doors, and de&s;troying all the beds and other furniture in the hou&s;es, as to oblige the owners to have recour&s;e to their neighbours for lodging and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

Two labour|ers and a &s;hoemaker were murdered in another place by &s;ome of the &s;traggling &s;oldiers, for endeavouring to prevent &s;ome attro|cious action, and for threatening to ring the alarm bell. A poor woman, 60 years of age, who was gleaning in a field, was forcibly thrown down by one of the Republican barbarians, and menaced with death if &s;he did not yield to his brutal de&s;ires, whil&s;t another &s;tood with his bayonet at the brea&s;t of her aged hu&s;band, and forced him to be a witne&s;s of his wife's di&s;honour. A church was broken open and plundered, and the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e completely rifled, under the eyes of general Moreau him|&s;elf, who to the lamentations of the &s;ufferer, contemptuou&s;ly replied, "I cannot prevent it"&mdash;and quietly betook him&s;elf to his favourite cherry brandy, in which he indulged him&s;elf to exce&s;s, like the meane&s;t of his &s;oldiers.</P>

<P>Before the armies of the French republic overran, vexed, and de&s;olated the Circle of Suabia, the inhabitants of the little town of Wald&s;ee were enabled to form a correct judgment of the cha|racter of the republican troops, from the conduct of the French pri&s;oners who had been originally quartered there between the 21&s;t of December 1795 and 6th of July 1796, &s;o that they heard of the approach of this lawle&s;s horde with more apprehen|&s;ions than the inhabitants of mo&s;t other places. The French behaved more like conquerors than pri&s;oners, not only towards the inhabitants, but towards the Au&s;trian officers and &s;oldiers; and when they heard that the whole French army had cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, their outrageous joy knew no bounds. They in&s;ulted the inhabitants in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, repaid the kindne&s;&s;es they had received with in&s;olence, and even with blows; began to pil|lage the hou&s;es of the pea&s;antry, robbed the gardens round the town, laid wa&s;te the corn fields, endeavoured forcibly to di&s;hon|our women and children, and by numerous exce&s;&s;es abu&s;ed the kind and noble manner in which they had been treated by the Au&s;trians. Several of the officers deceived the vigilance of the garri&s;on, and making excur&s;ions to the neighboring free Impe|rial towns of Raven&s;burg and Biberach, reconnoitred the coun|try, and found many who, either out of intere&s;t or from attach|ment to the emi&s;&s;aries of liberty and equality, degraded them|&s;elves by carrying on a traiterous corre&s;pondence with the enemy,

<P>Upon the 28th of July the Imperial general Frolich, at the head of his corps, quitted Wald&s;ee, where he had arrived upon the preceding day, and being too weak &s;ucce&s;sfully to contend with the &s;uperior numbers under the command of general Ferino, withdrew by Wurzach towards the Danube. He was followed by the emigrant legion amounting to nine or ten thou&s;and men, who upon the &s;econd of Augu&s;t were at &s;o &s;hort a di&s;tance from Wald&s;ee, that Ferino's advanced guard had pu&s;hed within a mile and a half of their rear. Upon the following day a detachment of French infantry entered the town, and whil&s;t their command|ing officer was endeavouring to per&s;uade the magi&s;trates that the inhabitants &s;hould enjoy the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity both in per&s;on and property, his &s;oldiers forcibly entered the &s;hops and carried away what they thought proper. The officer indeed ordered the goods to be re&s;tored, and appointed a non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer to execute his commands; but only a few trifling articles were returned, and the non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer publicly divided the re&s;t of the &s;poil among&s;t his comrades, not failing to take due care of him&s;elf. Reeling with wine, and loaded with plunder, they quitted Wald&s;ee in the evening, and were next morning &s;uc|ceeded by another detachment, five of whom ha&s;tened to a cha|pel, which they broke open and pillaged of the communion plate; after which they proceeded to a neighbouring village, plundered &s;everal hou&s;es, and fired 15 times at one Beckhinger, a miller, who defended his property like a hero, and who, with|out being him&s;elf wounded, &s;hot one of the robbers dead upon the &s;pot, broke the leg of another, and put the re&s;t to flight. In the mean time, tho&s;e in the town revelled in abundance; took the watches from the pockets of the inhabitants, and under pre|tence of paying in &s;pecie for what they wanted, forced the trade&s;men to open their &s;hops, took what articles they cho&s;e, and paid for them in mandats and a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>Upon the 7th of Augu&s;t, the advanced guard of the column commanded by general Ferino, amounting to 4, 000 men, under the orders of general Abbatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci, entered Wald&s;ee, which was now obliged to provide, not only for this army, but al&s;o the nu|merous out-po&s;ts beyond the town.

Not &s;atisfied with the common fare of the country, the&s;e pretended champions of liberty and equality, demanded large &s;uppl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of fi&s;h, butter, chee&s;e and fruit, after every meal, and if they were not in&s;tantly produced, they fell upon the landlord and &s;ervants, beat them, and threatened them with death, and fini&s;hed by plundering the kitchen, pantry and cel|lars, and &s;uch was their wilful wa&s;te of fodder, that in this &s;ingle lay &s;everal farmers were deprived of their whole provi&s;ion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e winter.</P>
<P>Upon the 8th of Augu&s;t, this unbridled horde quitted Wald|&s;ee, and Ferino him&s;elf appeared there at the head of the main body of the army, but was preceded by the adjutant general Berthold, who came to prepare quarters for the &s;taff, and who tendered him&s;elf odious by his unbounded in&s;olence and rapacity.

<P>At length, upon the 28th of September, the advanced guard of Ferino's column again marched into Wald&s;ee, and was quick|ly &s;ucceeded by the main body of the army. The hou&s;es were now crowded with &s;oldiers, who committed every &s;pecies of exce&s;s, and were even more fierce and malicious than before.

<P>It was u&s;ele&s;s to complain to the general officers of the unrea|&s;onable demands of the commi&s;&s;aries and the exce&s;&s;es of the &s;ol|diery, for their an&s;wer was, "Give them what they a&s;k for, and their extortions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate." And thus were they con&s;trained to &s;ee all the provi&s;ion of corn taken from the granary of the infirmary, and many of the inhabitants robbed of their whole &s;tock of fodder for the winter. At midnight the whole army unexpectedly began to move, and commenced their march with burning torches and lighted endles in their hands; their retreat was covered by general Jordis, and the next morn|ing not a Frenchman was to be &s;een in or near the town of Wald|&s;ee; though upon their march a band of cha&s;&s;eurs &s;traggled into an outlying hamlet, and demanded the immediate payment of 12 louis as a contribution; but the pea&s;antry not producing it &s;o &s;peedily as was expected, the banditti ru&s;hed into their hou&s;es, de&s;troyed every thing too bulky to be carried off, and rolling the winter &s;tock of bread in filth and ordure, with malicious and &s;a|tan-like &s;houts of laughter, offered it to the unfortunate and helple&s;s labourers.

<P>When the French appeared upon the banks of the lake of Con&s;tance, their leaders affected to be &s;urpri&s;ed that people &s;hould be afraid of them, and that many &s;hould de&s;ert the coun|try: "For," &s;aid they, "we are only come to offer peace to the Emperor, and not to violate either your religion, your cu&s;|toms, your per&s;ons, or your property, all which &s;hall be mo&s;t carefully re&s;pected and pre&s;erved."

The commi&s;&s;ary Stouhlen, one of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s men in the army, and for that rea&s;on the con|fidential favourite of Tarreau, not only &s;poke in the &s;ame tone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">out immediately i&s;&s;ued a requi&s;ition, by which 18,000 pounds weight of bread were ordered to be baked before nine o'clock at night, under the penalty of the town being given up to be plundered by the &s;oldiers. The chief magi&s;trate not aware that this was only a premiditated &s;cheme to rai&s;e money, was full of anxiety for the town, well knowing that &s;uch a provi&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="033325_0010_0FF6C65D0C8F0AC8">could not po&s;&s;ibly be made in &s;o &s;hort a time; but he was &s;oon relieved from his di&s;tre&s;s by a vi&s;it from Labrou&s;&s;e, one of Tar|reau's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ides-de-camp, and his faithful colleague in the arts of extortion, who advi&s;ed him to pacify the general by a pre&s;ent of two gold watches. "But," added he, "you mu&s;t not hint that I gave you this advice, for the general is a man of the <HI>mo&s;t delicate feelings,</HI> and the <HI>nice&s;t honour.</HI>" Two hand&s;ome gold watches were immediately procured, and offered to Tarreau, who&s;e fury abated, and who&s;e brow was &s;moothed; whil&s;t Stouhlen tore in pieces the requi&s;ition for the 18,000 pounds of bread. and &s;aid, "Let them bake what they can"&mdash;and &s;o ended the farce.</P>
<P>The column &s;oon afterwards proceeded on its march; but two days afterwards Stouhlen &s;ent a demand for 9,000 pounds weight of bread, which were delivered to him, and Markdorf was relieved from farther contributions, until the clo&s;e of September, though it &s;till &s;uffered much from the exactions and thefts committed by the troops, who were continually marching to and fro.</P>
<P>The retreat at length took place, and upon the 22d of Sep|tember the head quarters were fixed at Hofen, in the neighbour|hood of Markdorf, which, with the adjoining villages, now ex|perienced every &s;ort of oppre&s;&s;ion. Two of the commi&s;&s;aries, e&s;tabli&s;hed at different places near Markdorf, at the &s;ame time and with &s;imilar menaces, required from that town the mo&s;t ex|orbitant &s;upplies; &s;o that it was expo&s;ed to the mercile&s;s attacks of tho&s;e harpies, without a po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s, and requi&s;ition &s;ucceeded requi&s;ition. The deputy commi&s;&s;aries al&s;o vi&s;ited the adjacent country with their exactions, and obliged the pea&s;ants either to comply with their demands, or to purcha&s;e their exemp|tion with gold. "We coin requi&s;itions like money," &s;aid the commi&s;&s;ary Nonette, who, like his brethem, readily and public|ly de&s;i&s;ted from levying contributions in return for a pre&s;ent to him&s;elf; and the town of Markdorf was forced to pay him in ca&s;h the value of 20 tons of hay and of 25 &s;acks of oats, in order to prevent the threatened general pillage by the &s;ol|diery; nor could the execution of a &s;imilar menace from ano|ther commi&s;&s;ary be averted but by a well-timed pre&s;ent to his &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Upon, the morning of the fifth of October, Tarreau arrived at Markdorf with his &s;taff, and finding that his head quarters had been e&s;tabli&s;hed at the inn, he galloped up to the Ca&s;tle, and vehemently demanding why it had not been prepared for his

The people of Markdorf pa&s;&s;ed this whole night in the greate&s;t anxiety; for Tarreau had more than ten times threatened to &s;et fire to the town in four different places, and his ungovernable rage gave them good rea&s;on to apprehend the wor&s;t; they were, however, fortunate enough to e&s;cape the conflagration, and the next morn|ing the barbarian marched away with his divi&s;ion, followed by the execrations of the whole country, who upon the &s;ame day joyfully received the Au&s;trians as their deliverers from the iron yoke which had been impo&s;ed by the&s;e champions in the cau&s;e of liberty and equality. Their vi&s;itations co&s;t the inhabitants of Markdorf near 40,000 florins, or about &pound; 3,600 &s;terling; a large &s;um, con&s;idering that the town did not contain more than 350 heads of families, few of whom were in a &s;tate of affluence, and that they had, during &s;ome years, been very un&s;ucce&s;sful in the culture and produce of their vineyards.</P>
<P>It ought not to be forgotten, that in a hamlet near the town, ten brutal French &s;oldiers alternately violated the cha&s;tity of a woman, who hourly expected to be taken in labour, and who&s;e hu&s;band was forcibly made a witne&s;s of their barbarity. An offi|cer too, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been reque&s;ted by the neighbours, upon entering the hou&s;e, was &s;o far from reproving the &s;oldiers, that&mdash;horrible to relate!&mdash;he immediately followed their exam|ple, and added to the injuries already offered to the expiring woman. In another village, a woman who had only borne a child about eight days, was di&s;honoured and treated with &s;uch violence that her recovery was extremely doubtful, and when, in de&s;pair, &s;he fled from them in her &s;hift, and with her infant in her arms, &s;he was pur&s;ued by the loo&s;e jokes and malign &s;houts of the&s;e inhuman &s;ons of Satan, over who&s;e other atrocious actions in this di&s;trict it is now time to throw a veil.</P>

<P>Advice having been received at this town upon the 18th of September, that the divi&s;ion of the French army under general Tarreau, was retreating through that part of Suabia, the gates of the town were ordered to be &s;hut; and, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nor of a French proclamation of the 18th of Augu&s;t, they were not to be opened to any of the officers and &s;oldiers, except to &s;uch as had their route made out and &s;igned by the officers upon the &s;taff.

Three days afterwards, Tarreau, who probably had long wi&s;hed for an oblation from Meer&s;burg, &s;ent the following de&s;potic and alarming note to the magi&s;trates; "I command you to appear at my head-quarters at Y&s;&s;ni, in the cour&s;e of twenty four hours."

Upon examination of the deputies the next morning, and upon their declaration that the gates had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ut by order of the governor, Labrou&s;e ordered two carriages to be prepared, and immediately drove with them, e&s;corted by twenty hu&s;&s;ars, and preceded by a hangman to Meer&s;burg, when &s;uch members of the regency as had not e&s;caped were &s;ummoned and treated with the &s;ame in&s;olence and menances as the deputies had been &s;ubject to upon the preceding evening.

<HEAD>WEHR, A village in Au&s;trian Suabia.</HEAD>
<P>This place was vi&s;ited, upon the 18th of July 1796, by four mounted artillery men in ragged uniforms, who, in the &s;tyle of a requi&s;ition, demanded 66 &s;acks of oats, and three waggon loads of hay, which were no &s;ooner delivered to them, than they conveyed them to a neighbouring town, and there &s;old them for ready money.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month the environs were cur&s;ed with the pre&s;ence of general Tuncq, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho&s;e infamy is recorded in the annals of La Vendee, and who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his crimes by his aid-de-camp Schulz, the &s;on of a petty innkeeper at Huninguen. This general cho&s;e, as articles of plunder, wood and flax, and obliged the Baron de Schonaw, chief proprietor of Wehr, to cut down and deliver, in the cour&s;e of five days 372 oaks and other trees, which he floated down the Rhine into Switzerland, where he had previou&s;ly fixed an agent, who &s;old the wood, and divided the &s;poil with his employer.

The par&s;onage, 15 other hou&s;es, and 18 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arns, were &s;peedily reduced to a&s;hes, with their furniture, and all the produce of their late abundant harve&s;t; and the &s;ignal was already given for burning the remaining hou&s;es, when they received an order from head quarters to de&s;i&s;t, and immediately commence their retreat, the Au&s;trians being in full march again&s;t them. The mini&s;ter's brother had early &s;aved him&s;elf by flight, but the prie&s;t and his clerk were carried, chained together, as far as Muhlheim on the Danube, and there with difficulty re|lea&s;ed; and three of the clerk's children, who remained in the hou&s;e whil&s;t he e&s;caped into the church with the mini&s;ter, were inhumanly &s;uffered to peri&s;h in the flames.</P>
<P>The fate of the village of Barenthal was as &s;hocking as that already related. The perfidy with which the French violated the articles of the convention, and the inhumanity with which they treated the inhabitants of the di&s;tricts through which they pa&s;&s;ed, had determined the pea&s;antry to arm them&s;elves, and drive them out of their dwellings, the protection and &s;ecurity of which had been promi&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;olemn proclamations. So that when, upon the 6th October, a horde of robbers attempt|ed to plunder &s;ome hou&s;es is Barenthal, they were oppo&s;ed by the inhabitants, who, after a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, were defeated
<PB N="28" REF="033325_0015_0FF6C66A5CC57A80">with the lo&s;s of 5 killed, and 3 &s;o de&s;perately wounded that they &s;oon afterwards expired. The rage of the conquerors now vented it&s;elf upon the whole of the unfortunate village, which after being plundered of every thing valuable and portable, was &s;et on fire, and in a few h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, the church, 18 hou&s;es, and as many barns, were reduced to a heap of &s;hapele&s;s ruins. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants lo&s;t the whole of their property, and many years mu&s;t pa&s;s away before they can recover from the &s;tate of poverty into which they were plunged by the everts of that dreadful day.</P>
<P>The village of Durbheim was, upon the 7th of October, com|pletely &s;acked, with the exception of the par&s;onage and two other hou&s;es: and as it was not expected that the French would penetrate into that &s;eque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ered valley, no precautions had been taken, and every thing of value fell into the hands of the &s;ol|diers; notwith&s;tanding which they &s;earched the newly made graves, and broke open the coffins, in hopes of finding &s;ome trea&s;ure interred with the dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">odies.</P>
<P>They not only indulged in drinking to the mo&s;t bea&s;tly ex|ce&s;s, but, taking the cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ks out of the ca&s;ks, they &s;uffered the wine to run out on the cellar flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. They al&s;o led away 31 hor&s;es from this &s;mall village, and made the mini&s;ter exchange a favourite &s;addle hor&s;e, valued at 36 louis, for two half-&s;tarved ponies, which they had &s;tolen from a neighbouring farmer. Upon the 9th of October, the village was again vi&s;ited by &s;ix hu&s;&s;ars, who riding up to the par&s;onag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the mo&s;t terrifying menaces, demanded either a ca&s;k of wine or a pre&s;ent of &s;ix louis, and upon being refu&s;ed, not only &s;wore that they would burn the village, but actually fired into the hou&s;es, and &s;pread univer|&s;al con&s;ternation.

<HEAD>Of DUHEM, the General of Divi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">At Fribourg&punc; in Bri&s;gaw, in the circle of Suabia.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the 12th of October, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, orders were received to prepare quarters, in a gentleman's hou&s;e, for a French general and four officers; &s;oon after which appeared the general of divi&s;ion Duhem, and a &s;uite of 30 or 40 officers, &s;everal privates, and &s;ervants, who were re|ceived with the greate&s;t complai&s;ance. But the general, in a com|manding tone, gave orders that a dinner, fit for a republican ge|neral and twenty-five of his retinue, &s;hould be provided at five o'clock, and he added, that he expected to be in all re&s;pects treat|ed and attended according to his rank and dignity. Six rooms and the &s;aloon were immediately opened; but the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e not being able, in the hurry and confu&s;ion, to find the keys of the other apartments, the general threatened to break open the doors, and his aid-de-camp began to talk about cudgels and hor&s;e|whips. Before I proceed, let me relate an anecdote of this aid-de-camp, highly characteri&s;tic of him and his a&s;&s;ociates: Duhem hav|ing i&s;&s;ued an order that the magi&s;trates of Fribourg &s;hould furni&s;h the in&s;truments u&s;ed in the Turki&s;h mu&s;ic, and they having repre|&s;ented to the aid-de-camp the impo&s;&s;ibility of obeying &s;o unrea|&s;onable a demand, that &s;hamele&s;s reprobate replied, "that if they would procure him a couple of hand&s;ome girls, they might keep the Turki&s;h mu&s;ic for them&s;elves."</P>
<P>The general, officers, and privates pa&s;&s;ed their whole time at the table, and every exertion was made to &s;atisfy their gluttony, but in vain; for upon the 13th of October general Duhem, after bitterly complaining of his ordinary fare, with many threats commanded the delivery of 20 pounds weight of &s;ugar, 16 of coffee, 16 of rice, and 18 lemons, which he had no &s;ooner received, than he made a further demand of 50 bottles of champaigne, and 30 bot|tles of &s;weet wine; and the next morning, before his departure, he i&s;&s;ued a fre&s;h order for 50 more bottles of champaigne, which he received and conveyed away. Neither were his &s;ervants idle; for in the afternoon of the 13th of October, they broke into the &s;addle hou&s;e, and plundered it of all the &s;addles and har|ne&s;s they could find; and though the general and &s;ome of his officers &s;aw them carry away their &s;poil, and were applied to for redre&s;s, they did not chu&s;e to li&s;ten to the complaint, but &s;uffered the booty to be carried off. When Duhem and his followers quitted the hou&s;e, upon the fourteenth of October, it was di&s;covered that they had left in their apartments and
<PB N="31" REF="033325_0016_0FF6C66D1912E260">beds the mo&s;t filthy traces of their exi&s;tence, and that they had &s;tolen &s;everal pairs of &s;heets and a hand&s;ome counterpane, and rifled a portmanteau of its contents. The upper part of this hou&s;e had been previou&s;ly plundered by a commi&s;&s;ary's a&s;&s;i&s;tant in July, and was now again publicly robbed, not by the ungo|vernable &s;oldiery, but by a general, who affected to talk about di&s;cipline, and by his officers and &s;ervants. A French lieutenant had indeed been degraded and &s;ent to the galleys for levying a trifling contribution when the French fir&s;t appeared at Fribourg; but that was done only to deceive the Germans until they had got a firm footing in the country, after which the incendiaries, murderers, and plunderers of all de&s;criptions were &s;uffered to com|mit their ravages with impunity.</P>

<P>To this place of the 8th of October was a day of terror and ca|lamity; and as the report of the French cruelties had already reached the ears of the inhabitants, the women and children fled, with &s;ome of their valuable effects, into an adjoining wood, hop|ing to be there &s;ecure from the attacks of the &s;oldiers, who were now upon their retreat, and entered the village, to the number of 3000. Some of them &s;topped at the par&s;onage, and demanded

When the &s;oldiers had here &s;atisfied their rapacity, and plundered the poor fugitives of nearly all that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they completed the tragedy with outrages the mo&s;t &s;hocking to humanity. Married women were di&s;honoured in the pre&s;ence of their hu&s;bands and children; and young girls were de&s;poiled of their innocence under the eyes of their parents and companions.

<P>When the French entered this place, they te&s;tified &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;pect for the articles of the convention, which had been purcha&s;ed at &s;o great a price; but upon the following day they threw off the ma&s;k, a&s;&s;umed their proper character of plunder|ers, and turned the conte&s;t again&s;t kings into war with the pea|&s;ants and mechanics. But this was only a prelude to greater calamities; for general Vandamme having, either through ig|norance or inattention, e&s;tabli&s;hed his military che&s;t at Stozin|gen, under a &s;mall guard, and an Au&s;trian party, lying only five miles di&s;tant, having in the cour&s;e of their patrole, fallen in with and carried it off, and made the guard pri&s;oners, the inhabitants were accu&s;ed of having given information to the Au&s;trians, and a detachment, under the command of colonel Lavalle, arrived upon the 10th of Augu&s;t, with orders to &s;et fire to the village. Old and young, and women with infants at the brea&s;t, rending the air with their lamentations, ha&s;tily fled into the fields, and at four o'clock the cannons were pointed again&s;t the hou&s;es, whil&s;t the hu&s;&s;ars and cha&s;&s;eurs with cocked pi&s;tols and drawn &s;words, prevented the flight of the few who had remained there.

<HEAD>AYSTETTEN, A village in the neigbourhood of Aug&s;burg, in the Circle of Suabia.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the 22d of Augu&s;t this place was vi&s;ited by a party of the French, who broke open the cellar in the ca&s;tle, drank or carried away a large quantity of foreign wine, &s;tole or de&s;troyed much of the furniture, and conveyed away their &s;poil in a car|riage drawn by two fine hor&s;es, which they took out of the &s;ta|ble. From that period until the middle of September, not a day pa&s;&s;ed but the village was either plundered by &s;oldiers or oppre&s;&s;ed by commi&s;&s;aries armed with requi&s;itions; and as they con&s;tantly rendered u&s;ele&s;s what they could not carry away, the damages &s;u&s;tained by the inhabitants amounted to upwards of 3,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling.

<P>A man happening indi&s;creetly to expre&s;s his joy at the retreat of the French, and the near approach of the Au&s;trians, was &s;hot at and mortally wounded; and another, who had expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;atisfaction, and had attempted to defend his property, was deliberately &s;hot, after tearing his fle&s;h to pieces, and pulling his tongue out by the roots. Married women and girls, mothers and their daughters, who had hoped for &s;afety in the church, were violated at the foot of the altar; and neither the venerable age of &s;eventy or eighty years, nor the mo&s;t loath&s;ome di&s;orders and deformities, could check the pa&s;&s;ions of the invaders, who left behind them traces of di&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e very names had until then been unknown in this &s;eque&s;tered di&s;trict. All the archives in the town-hou&s;e were wantonly de&s;troyed, the churches in eve|ry way profaned and defiled, and even the cro&s;&s;es upon the graves of the dead were objects of their fury and pa&s;&s;ion for de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But it was re&s;erved for Gen.

<HEAD>OF GENERAL TARREAU, At Hofen, a Benedictine convent, in Suabia, near the Lake of Con&s;tance.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the leaders of the French hordes have, by their mi&s;deeds, forever connected their names with infamy; but gene|ral Tarreau united in him&s;elf the &s;everal bad qualities of the re&s;t. and cannot be mentioned without horror and dete&s;tation. The mo&s;t unbounded rapacity, in&s;atiable cruelty, intemperance, thir&s;t of revenge, vulgar in&s;olence, contempt of every thing &s;acred and decent, and the di&s;avowal of all the feelings of humanity, formed the ba&s;is of the character of this man, who in no country but in France, and there only under the au&s;pices of &s;uch a revolution, could ever have been entru&s;ted with the command of an army. Some of his mon&s;trous exce&s;&s;es have already been recorded, and it remains only to be told, that when the French were obliged to give way before the Au&s;trians, this man, raging like a tiger that had lo&s;t its prey, arrived upon the 23d of September at Hofen, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters, and with his worthy a&s;&s;o|ciate Labrou&s;&s;e, and his confidential valet Laguerre, endeavoured to make him&s;elf a &s;mall compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of the &s;poils of Vienna, of which the French had thought them&s;elves &s;ecure. His whole character will be&s;t be known from the following dread|ful declaration, which was continually upon his lips, that "He only repented having at any time acted with humanity, and of not having converted into du&s;t and a&s;hes all the cities, villages, and
<PB N="38" REF="033325_0020_0FF6C677B207A1E8">convents he had &s;een upon his march." His life at Hofen was one continued &s;cene of cruelty, robbery, intemperance, and debauche|ry; and upon the 23d of September he &s;ent a requi&s;ition to Con|&s;tance of 6,000 pints of brandy, to be delivered in 24 hours, under pain of being given up to be plundered by the &s;oldiery. No more than half of the quantity demanded could be found in Con|&s;tance, and was &s;ent off towards head quarters by water, but was detained by contrary winds; upon which Farreau threatened not only to &s;et fire to the town, but to put to death the chief magi&s;|trate, and &s;everal others whom he detained as ho&s;tages, and who, after pa&s;&s;ing the night under the apprehen&s;ions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> approaching death, would probably have fallen a &s;acrifice to the pa&s;&s;ion of this &s;anguinary commander, if the brandy had not arrived in the morn|ing before the hour appointed for their execution. The booty remained three days at head quarters, and was then &s;old by the commi&s;&s;ary Stouhlen to the neighbouring Swi&s;s; nor did the French &s;oldiers ta&s;te one drop of this liquor, which had been ex|torted under pretence that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the army.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTES of various French Generals, Officers, and Com|mi&s;&s;aries.</HEAD>
<P>THAT not only privates, but that even officers of rank, either pillaged or divided the &s;poil, is proved by innumerable in&s;tances, of which we think it nece&s;&s;ary only to notice the following. A carriage laden with plunder, belonging to an officer upon the &s;taff, having broken down during the retreat of the French army, two of the inhabitants of the village of Eyken, where the acci|dent happened, were obliged in&s;tantly to provide another convey|ance, and re-load the booty, which was &s;o &s;peedily and well exe|cuted, that, contrary to their expectation, and to the u&s;ual practice of his comrades, he rewarded them with 16 pounds weight of tal|low, and a complete &s;et of joiners' tools! Another officer of rank &s;old in the &s;ame village a bird cage and a Bohemian drinking gla&s;s for the &s;um of about &s;even pence &s;terling; and at Rheinfel|den, another officer having &s;old a hor&s;e to a Swi&s;s of the Can|ton of Ba&s;le for 9 louis, he no &s;ooner received the money than jumping upon the hor&s;e he gallopped away, and di&s;appeared both with the hor&s;e and money. A &s;oldier having &s;tripped a gentle|man's &s;ervant of the boots he was wearing, was, upon the com|plaint of the &s;ervant to an officer, obliged to re&s;tore them; but the officer drawing them on, and finding that they fitted him, told the &s;ervant, in a jeering tone, that they were much too good
<PB N="39" REF="033325_0020_0FF6C677B207A1E8">for him, and &s;trutted away with them. Whil&s;t the French were at Donauwerth, a general officer, accompanied by two officers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd e&s;corted by &s;ix hu&s;&s;ars, e&s;pying &s;ome ducks and poultry in a farm-yard in a village through which they were riding, the officers di&s;mounted, and whil&s;t the general held their hor&s;es, they &s;tole the ducks and fowls, and returned triumphantly to Donauwerth with their booty. When Tarreau had his head quarters at the im|perial town of Wangen, he made a requi&s;ition of &s;uch a quantity of corn as it was impo&s;&s;ible for the municipality to furni&s;h; but the chief magi&s;trate having received a hint that the general was very fond of cray-fi&s;h, he &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of &s;ome out of an adjoining lake, famous in Suabia for tho&s;e fi&s;h, with which the general was &s;o plea&s;ed that he withdrew the demand for corn, but put in requi&s;ition all the cray-fi&s;h in the lake for the daily &s;upply of his table, as long as he &s;hould remain there. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">panion to the foregoing anecdote, we will mention, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a village near Wi&s;baden, upon the Rhine, one of the commi&s;&s;aries of the army of the Sambre and Meu&s;e put in requi&s;ition not only all the wine belonging to the Mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, but his gla&s;&s;es, bottles, kitchen furniture, table linen, and napkins for twelve per&s;ons, and even his hou&s;e-keeper, to prepare the dinner; and further informed him, that he mu&s;t &s;end to Wi&s;bad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to purcha&s;e what they wanted, and what his hou&s;e did not afford.</P>
<P>Some French &s;oldiers having &s;tolen a very fine hor&s;e out of a farmer's &s;table near Aug&s;burg, he complained to the adjutant-ge|neral Houel, who promi&s;ed him redre&s;s, but upon &s;eeing the hor&s;e, thought proper to retain it for his own u&s;e. But it &s;hould &s;eem as if Providence connived a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this crime, as carrying its pu|ni&s;hment along with it, for Houel was &s;hortly after drowned in cro&s;&s;ing the Leck, whil&s;t riding the &s;tolen hor&s;e, which worked its way through the water, and fortunately found its road back to its old ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>A republican general having upon the retreat taken up his quar|ters at the hou&s;e or a clergyman, went qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tly to bed after demand|ing and receiving &s;ix &s;hirts for him&s;elf and his followers; but his &s;ervants &s;oon afterwards came to the clergyman with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from their ma&s;ter to procure him a hand&s;ome b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ellow, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> refu|&s;ed, and threatened in ca&s;e of ill-u&s;age to alarm the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antry; upon which they de&s;ired that they might be allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">duce one out of the village, to which he &s;o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed that, being few in number, they thought proper to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> from their de|mands.

<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tics of every de&s;cription and every religion, and parti|cularly the profe&s;&s;ed, of both &s;exes, &s;eemed the chief objects of republican malevolence, in morality, and cruelty, in which the &s;ol|diers were led on and encouraged by their officers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pect for decency and for the &s;ufferers forbids us to particularize the num|berle&s;s well authenticated proofs of this a&s;&s;ertion, and to name the places where aged prie&s;ts were forced to the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t indecent and immoral actions, and where nuns were &s;tripped of their garments, and obliged to dance in a &s;tate of nature with the officers and &s;oldiers. At a &s;mall town in Suabia, the friars and nuns belonging to two neighbouring convents were convened by command of the French officers, bound fa&s;t together face to face, with their hands tied behind their backs, and each was obliged to drink a cup full of coffee, containing a &s;trong emetic; and in that po&s;ition did they remain until the medicine had operated, whil&s;t the officers rejoiced and &s;houted as if they performed &s;ome heroic action.</P>
<P>And here let us conclude the detail of crimes, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing in cruelty and variety any exce&s;&s;es ever before committed by the &s;ol|diers of a civilized country, and rendered more hideous, when we con&s;ider that the perpetrators proclaim them&s;elves the mo&s;t hu|mane and enlightened people of the earth, and endeavour to &s;educe the &s;ubjects of other countries from their allegiance by the &s;peci|ous but treacherous offer of a liberty pregnant with mi&s;chief, and of an equality which has been found to be impracticable.</P>

They mu&s;t <HI>receive a con&s;titution from Paris.</HI> They re|fu&s;ed, and collected their army; but, &s;till <HI>indeci&s;ive</HI> (ju&s;t like our Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,) they ordered their army not to act. At la&s;t, while they were &s;till <HI>debating,</HI> comes the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans-cu|lottes and di&s;per&s;es them at the point of the bayonet. The Swi&s;s army was &s;ound; the people were brave and active; but what, with &s;uch governors, were they to do again&s;t ten times their forces &mdash;They ru&s;hed on the enemy's cannon; were blown to pieces by thou&s;ands. The women fought by the &s;ides of their hu&s;bands; no le&s;s than <HI>eight hundred</HI> of them expired under the &s;abres of the
<PB N="44" REF="033325_0023_0FF6C67E69735BD0">bloody French. With the&s;e gallant females the liberty of Swit|zerland groaned out its la&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus, AMERICANS, have <HI>all the republics of Europe,</HI> for their endeavouring to <HI>conciliate</HI> with France; for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <HI>injury</HI> and <HI>in&s;ult;</HI> for their whining, cringing, and crawling for <HI>peace,</HI> been finally rewarded by the &s;ubver&s;ion of their governments, by the lo&s;s of their property, by the ma&s;&s;acre of their people, by being reduced to the la&s;t degree of national wretchedne&s;s and di&s;|grace, and by being rendered the &s;corn and contempt of the Uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>But, the example is not complete without &s;hewing you what would have been the effect of an <HI>oppo&s;ite conduct.</HI> This you mu&s;t al&s;o learn by again turning you: eyes on Europe. There you will perceive, that tho&s;e who have fought the French with bravery, who have ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ted the progre&s;s of their principles, and who have never yielded to their in&s;olent demands, are &s;till &s;ecure in the enjoyment of their commerce, their wealth, their liberty, and their religion.</P>
<P>Viewing the general de&s;olation of Europe, the fallen &s;tate of all the countries that have &s;ubmitted to the &s;courge of the republicans, and the calamitous, the brutal condition of the&s;e republicans them|&s;elves, what a grand and noble figure do the people of Great-Brit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in exhibit to &s;urrounding nations, &s;tanding, as they do, firm and erect amid&s;t the &s;torm, proudly determined not to &s;ubmit to the will of the enemy, bravely re&s;olved to &s;acrifice every comfort in &s;upport of their religion and their liberties, and &s;till enjoying all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, of which other countries have, in &s;o &s;hort a period, been bereaved! Their trade and manufactures &s;till flouri&s;h "thro' the &s;tate," and &s;urpa&s;s the commercial enterprizes and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of all the other nations in the world. Agriculture, far from langui&s;h|ing during the war, has been pur&s;ued with unexampled vigor and pro&s;perity; all their excellent in&s;titutions continue to thrive under the unremitting a&s;&s;iduity of their governors, and the cea&s;ele&s;s ge|nero&s;ity of the public; and the national benevolence has been mo&s;t nobly di&s;played in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and ample &s;ub&s;criptions for the relief of per&s;ecuted foreigners, for that of their own wounded &s;ol|dies and &s;ailors, and for the benefit of the widows and the orphans of tho&s;e who have fallen in fighting the battles of their country. The intercour&s;e between man and man is pre&s;erved unalloyed by &s;u&s;picion; the charms of &s;ociety remain uncontrouled by terror; their wives and daughters &s;leep without apprehen&s;ion of being di&s;|turbed by the violator or the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; and their property is &s;ecured

In naval &s;ame they have made a va&s;t acqui&s;ition. In that part of the war which belongs to Britain, they have obtained &s;ucce&s;&s;es which &s;urpa&s;s the mo&s;t brilliant examples of their ance&s;tors: Hi&s;|tory abounds with the noble deeds of Briti&s;h tars; but it was re|&s;erved for GEORGE THE THIRD, after deci&s;ive and glorious vic|tories &s;ucce&s;&s;ively gained over the fleets of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to &s;ee his navy ride triumphant at the &s;ame moment, at the mouths of <HI>Bre&s;t, Cadiz,</HI> and the <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such,</HI> AMERICANS, <HI>and &s;o &s;ituated, is the nation from whom, generally &s;peaking, you are de&s;cended. Compare her &s;ituation with that of the degraded</HI> peace-&s;eeking <HI>republics of Europe, and then de|termine which example you &s;hall follow.
