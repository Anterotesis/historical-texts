<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN defiance of a doctrine which DESPOTS have taught their <HI>Slaves,</HI> that INGRATITUDE is the vice of a REPUBLIC, WE are a&s;&s;embled my FELLOW CITIZENS at the recommen|dation of our GOVERNMENT, to commemorate the virtues and deplore the lo&s;s of the BENEFACTOR of OUR COUN|TRY&mdash;WASHINGTON is no more! The man to whom under GOD, we are indebted for the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of INDEPENDENCE, <HI>&s;leeps the &s;leep</HI> of DEATH! The ARM, which has protected from <HI>rapine</HI> the <HI>fruits</HI> of our SOIL, and from <HI>violence</HI> the <HI>cha&s;tity</HI> of our FAIR, FOW moulders with its kindred du&s;t! The TONGUE which by its <HI>mildne&s;s</HI> has &s;o often charmed the &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility, and by its <HI>energy</HI> has "&s;poken daggers to a tyrant," is hu&s;hed in eternal &s;ilence! The STAR which guided our watchmen to their political &s;alvation has &s;et in GLORY.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="036800_0004_100B10C1ADC6FA98">
Arrogance would be a mild epithet for the man, who &s;hould attempt by his rhetoric or his eloquence to give ad|ditional lu&s;tre to a character already beyond the voice of eu|logy.&mdash;Ours is the melancholy, yet plea&s;ing duty &s;imply to record the glorious deeds, and to call into recollection the important &s;ervices which were performed by this JOSHUA of our land, for the benefit of OUR FATHERS, OURSELVES and POSTERITY.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of his political career, we find him ap|pointed by the government of Virginia to a tru&s;t honourable and important; and this too at a period of his life when pub|lic HOPE could &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to have ripened into CONFIDENCE.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of our warfare on the frontiers with the FRENCH and the NATIVES introduces us to a &s;econd acquaint|ance with our departed FRIEND and warmly engages our feelings in his intere&s;t, by its recital of the memorable defeat of the brave, but imprudent BRADDOCK. Had this unfor|tunate General been guided by the advice of the man, though
<PB N="5" REF="036800_0005_100B10C3A7B90D58"><HI>young</HI> in ARMS, yet <HI>&s;age</HI> in COUNSEL, in all human probabil|ity the di&s;a&s;ters of that melancholy day had been averted.&mdash; But Heaven allotted a reward to the courage and circum&s;pec|tion of WASHINGTON, to him has ju&s;tly been a&s;cribed the glory of covering the retreat, and &s;aving the remains of that &s;laughtered army. From this period, his talents were di|rected to the more particular &s;ervice of his native &s;tate, until his appointment to the command of our confederated troops. &mdash;At this <HI>epoch,</HI> &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the annals of liberty, the cruel, the unnatural, the damnable arrogation of &s;upreme power by the Briti&s;h government demanded the united and determined oppo&s;ition of our Nation&mdash;the demand was not unheard, nor its efficacy unfelt&mdash;our Congre&s;s had mode&s;tly petitioned, and the petition was di&s;carded, it had manful|ly remon&s;trated, and the remon&s;trance was ridiculed.&mdash;Duti|ful and affectionate as had been the then Colonies to their parent country, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for the human mind to explore a cau&s;e for the conduct of the latter, were it not known, that it was governed by a Parliament dive&s;ted of <HI>principle,</HI> and a Monarch de&s;titute of <HI>intellect.</HI>&mdash;But Ameri|ca was not to be lulled into &s;lavery&mdash;the corruption, which
<PB N="6" REF="036800_0006_100B10C533B78468">originated, and the folly which &s;upported the de&s;ign of invad|ing our liberties, was early penetrated by the centinels of our freedom. To combat the de&s;igns of this unprovoked ene|my, it became nece&s;&s;ary that an army &s;hould be rai&s;ed and of cour&s;e that a leader &s;hould be appointed. The GUARDIAN GENIUS of our county &s;urely pre&s;ided on that au&s;picious hour, which depo&s;ited this all-important tru&s;t in the hands of WASHINGTON.&mdash;My FELLOW CITIZENS, let the FIFTEENTH DAY OF JUNE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE be <HI>hallowed</HI> in our memories. Reflect, that on that day your EARTHLY FATHER un&s;heathed his &s;word in the defence of your RIGHTS and that it never re|turned to its &s;cabbard till your WRONGS were avenged&mdash; guided by his "ruling pa&s;&s;ion" the love of his country, he relinqui&s;hed dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and with a noblene&s;s of mind peculiar to him&s;elf, refu&s;ed the pecuniary emoluments of his &s;tation.&mdash;The acceptance of this important command naturally led him to the &s;eat of war, and on the &s;econd of Ju|ly following, he commenced his official duty at Cambridge&mdash; but a few months &s;ucceeded, and the term for which our lit|tle army had enli&s;ted expired.&mdash;Many of you, my fellow
<PB N="7" REF="036800_0007_100B10C8111CEBA0">citizens, can recollect, and tho&s;e of us who cannot, have been told, that "darkne&s;s, clouds and &s;hadows" then re&s;ted upon our country&mdash;patrioti&s;m had not &s;o far gained an a&s;cendency that a body of naked, unfed, unpaid and undi&s;ciplined troops would patiently &s;ubmit to the hard&s;hips of war, and, far from their homes, encounter the inclemencies of an approaching winter&mdash;liberty, maje&s;tic as is her form, &s;eemed to faulter in her &s;teps at the apparent indifference of her di&s;ciples. Her eye had lo&s;t its lu&s;tre, and her garb was &s;ackcloth.&mdash;This was a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> in our political di&s;ea&s;e, which requited the con|&s;titution of a WASHINGTON to &s;upport. <HI>His</HI> was framed by Heaven to meet the MALADY, to counteract its <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> and to mock its <HI>terrors.</HI> Neither intimidated by the formi|dable appearance of a neighboring and a veteran foe, nor de|pre&s;&s;ed by the di&s;tracted &s;ituation of the army which he com|manded, he philo&s;ophically planned and calmly pur&s;ued tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which re&s;tored the inhabitants of our capital to the enjoyment of their former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be unnece&s;&s;ary to recapitulate the &s;cenes of our revolution, for the purpo&s;e of pourtraying the
<PB N="8" REF="036800_0008_100B10C998C41A68">brilliant features of WASHINGTON.&mdash;Every father knows, and it is pre&s;umed has taught his children, that dur|ing the gloomy periods of the conte&s;t his courage was un|&s;haken and his ardour unabated; that in the &s;plendid and glorious career of his victories, he never forgot that he was the &s;ervant of his country&mdash;dreary mu&s;t have been his pro&s;|pects at Long I&s;land and through the Jer&s;ies, yet his fortitude did not for&s;ake him&mdash;his brilliant &s;ucce&s;s at York Town, tho' noticed with religious gratitude, &s;eemed little to elate that tranquil mind, which adver&s;ity could not depre&s;s. Re|lying on the ju&s;tice of that Being, whom WE &s;acredly in|voked at the commencement of our ho&s;tilities, with fervent hope and humble dependence to him, he entru&s;ted the de|ci&s;ion of that important que&s;tion, whether "ALL MEN" were, or were not, "born FREE AND EQUAL." The decrees of HEAVEN &s;anctioned the declaration of our rights, and the PILOT of our choice having encountered perils and tempe&s;ts, conducted our POLITICAL BARQUE to the haven of INDE|PENDENCE. Crowned with laurels of unfading lu&s;tre, he left the "tented field," and his pathetic farewell and &s;ol|emn addre&s;s to the di&s;banding army evinced that the wi&s;dom
<PB N="9" REF="036800_0009_100B10CC288B41D8">of the SAGE was not inferiour to the valour of the HERO. The commi&s;&s;ion which had been reluctantly accepted was cheerfully re&s;igned, and the MAN who had &s;aved an EMPIRE retired to the &s;hades of private life.&mdash;Had the turbulent &s;pirit of a CAESAR or a CROMWELL been implanted in the brea&s;t of WASHINGTON, what human power could have affixed the limits or pre&s;cribed the terms of his dominion? An army of which he was the Idol, di&s;affected with what they con&s;idered the ingratitude of our government, and irri|tated by the artful &s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;igning incendiaries, was almo&s;t ripened for revolt and ready to point their weapons at the bo&s;om of their country.&mdash;A nod, a &s;mile of approbation from their chief would have been &s;ufficient to have "let loo&s;e the dogs of civil war," and to have placed a fortunate and a favorite commander in any &s;tation to which his ambi|tion might have a&s;pired. Happy is it for America and pro|pitious to the cau&s;e of univer&s;al liberty, that a "re&s;tle&s;s and ungoverned temper" was not WASHINGTON's. As anxious to hu&s;h the murmurs of his fellow-&s;oldiers, as he had been eager to lead them to victory and honor, his per|&s;ua&s;ive
<PB N="10" REF="036800_0010_100B10CDF71B44F0">eloquence and confident a&s;&s;urances effectually &s;ilenced the voice of di&s;content, and di&s;armed the Daemons of in&s;ur|rection.</P>
<P>But a few months of peace and independence had been enjoyed, when experience taught us, that the nerves of our government were too weak for a regular &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;The Con|federation, which had been adopted in the exigency of the moment, was mouldering to decay; its &s;trength was in&s;uffi|cient to &s;upport its own weight, and our young Republic was tottering to its ruin. The elders of our country, the prophets of our land, alarmed at the impending danger, laid the ba&s;is and reared the columns of that glorious Con|&s;titution which WE now enjoy, and which, under a wi&s;e ad|mini&s;tration, will effectually &s;ecure our privilegesi and pro|tect our dignity.</P>
<P>In the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-nine, WASHINGTON was elected PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, and again left the repo&s;e of private life, for the ar|duous and re&s;pon&s;ible duties of that important &s;tation. It
<PB N="11" REF="036800_0011_100B10D0D9E42898">would be an impeachment of the gratitude of my country|men, to remind them, with what devotion he then dedicated his time and his talents to their &s;ervice.&mdash;It mu&s;t be engraven on every heart, and the recollection can never depart but with the departure of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>While our feelings are thus gratefully alive, let us remem|ber the &s;acred legacy which he left his con&s;tituents, at the time of his re&s;ignation of office&mdash;&s;o long as truth &s;hall be believed, and wi&s;dom revered, &s;hall WASHINGTON's "FAREWELL ADDRESS" be cla&s;&s;ed with the fir&s;t of human productions.</P>
<P>Fatigued with the weight of government, he mode&s;tly retires again to private life, and is again called forth to the command of our armies. In conformity to the wi&s;hes of the people whom he loved, he accepted the appointment, and although age had &s;cattered its wrinkles on the MAN, the WARRIOR was yet in bloom.&mdash;Here the curtain mu&s;t drop! The public life of this GREAT man clo&s;es, for he pays the <HI>dept of nature.</HI>&mdash;This day, had Providence permitted, would
<PB N="12" REF="036800_0012_100B10D2D3836068">have completed the <HI>&s;ixty-eighth</HI> year of a life of un&s;ullied vir|tue and unrivalled glory&mdash;but he is gone! His expiring moments witne&s;&s;ed his FORTITUDE and his RELIGION, and ANGELS now &s;mile on their COMPANION.</P>
