<L>WHEN Peace with the Indans was almo&s;t concluded,</L>
<L>And the life-mowing Sword, which was very much blooded,</L>
<L>Tir'd out with hard Labor, and hewing down men,</L>
<L>Was like to be put in its Scabard again;</L>
<L N="5">Some Lads, of who&s;e Courage no Mortal can doubt,</L>
<L>Who's Brav'ry and Valor admits no Di&s;pute,</L>
<L>Having long liv'd in Paxton, and had many Swingings</L>
<L>From mercile&s;s, &s;avage, and barbarous Indians,</L>
<L>Straitway did re&s;olve! 'fore the Land was at ea&s;e,</L>
<L N="5">And all our affairs were in quiet and Peace,</L>
<L>To leave their hou&s;es, their wives, and <HI>Peas-porridge,</HI></L>
<L>And give a remarkable proof of their Courage:</L>
<L>A proof, which without farther har&s;hing or mincing,</L>
<L>Might be to the world mo&s;t full and convincing.</L>
<L N="5">Tho' &s;ome, we confe&s;s, do mo&s;t &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect,</L>
<L>(And they're men of good Sen&s;e and &s;ound Intelect)</L>
<L>That their Revd. S&mdash;d&mdash;n &s;et them to Work,</L>
<L>To promote the advantage and good of the K&mdash;k;</L>
<L>Knowing wi&s;ely that if a thing's well intended,</L>
<L N="5">No matter by what evil means 'tis defended.</L>
<L>But as learn'd Commentators have not yet decided,</L>
<L>Whether K&mdash;k or their <HI>Valor</HI> in Council pre&s;ided;</L>

<L>Their Plan to perform without farther delaying;</L>
<L>In a num'rous A&s;&s;embly they fix'd on and cho&s;e</L>
<L>Two <HI>well-gifted</HI> men, of their <HI>&s;piritual hou&s;e;</HI></L>
<L>Who, fill'd up to the Brim with internal Lights,</L>
<L N="5">Might guide and direct them in dark foggy Nights;</L>
<L>Which Lights, for &s;ome rea&s;ons mo&s;t obvious and plain,</L>
<L>Are apparent to none but their own Bretheren.</L>

The one hight <HI>O'Haro,</HI> the other <HI>O'Rigan,</HI></L>

<L>In their outward behavior, the hard-hearted Laws</L>
<L>Had &s;entenc'd, to &s;eek in the&s;e we&s;tern Plantations</L>
<L>A better reception and kind habitations;</L>
<L>Notwith&s;tanding I &s;ay this cruel rejection,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till for the K&mdash;k they retain'd their affection;</L>
<L>And by her in&s;tructions were mo&s;t fitly train'd</L>
<L>To perform with eclat, &s;uch a <HI>glorious Command.</HI></L>
<L>As hawks that are wont le&s;s birds to infe&s;t,</L>
