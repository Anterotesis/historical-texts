</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADMINISTRATION dare not, as yet (or el&s;e they would) deny the &s;ubjects right of petiti|oning the King; but Bute and Mansfield, will not &s;uffer even the petition of the fir&s;t city in the king|dom, to be received upon the throne. Can their &s;upreme Lord&s;hips give a rea&s;on why? I mean a &s;olid rea&s;on. It is an undoubted, and till now has been an undi&s;puted right, which this grateful city claims, a right, which no Royal tyrant in pa&s;t ages has controuled.</P>
<P>This late political di&s;play of Sovereign in&s;olence, has broken out, to dignify the pre&s;ent reign; our Kings are &s;till ready to receive a petition from the greate&s;t city in the univer&s;e, but they are the judges where&mdash;at their Levee&mdash;or in their water clo&s;e?&mdash; Be it ordained henceforth, that all petitions for re|dre&s;s of national grievances &s;hall be received where
<PB N="214" REF="013992_0002_0F92591A82029278">they may be mo&s;t u&s;eful to the &s;overeign, and lea&s;t likely to ri&s;e in judgement again&s;t the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Is it come to this at la&s;t, that one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject is to be treated with indignity? Is it become a farce that may be acted at a &s;ycophantic Levee, and attended to with as much affected indifference as a birth-day ode? Is the ground and rea&s;on of this invaluable right for|got? Or are the rights of the crown alone to be main|tained, and tho&s;e of the &s;ubject trampled under foot? Let us enquire into the foundation of the &s;ubject's right to addre&s;s the throne; we &s;hall then &s;ee with what propriety, policy, or decency, this &s;atisfaction is refu&s;ed now. Whil&s;t the &s;overeign has a right to allegiance, the &s;ubject has an equal claim to protection.</P>
<P>The&s;e e&s;&s;entials from the bond of union, the re|ciprocal relation, between the governor and the go|verned; that the &s;tate may enjoy the benefits ari|&s;ing from this union, the King becomes the head of the body politic, by the &s;uffrage of a free people; the people remain members of this body politic, giving up their natural rights, by compact with the &s;overeign, for the &s;ake of protection and good go|vernment. The&s;e are the two great ends which every &s;ubject has in view. A King of England, on the other hand has not a &s;ingle prerogative which is not conducive to the&s;e two great ends. This is the true &s;tate of an Engli&s;h Sovereign, and an En|gli&s;h &s;ubject: in con&s;equence, a good Sovereign may well expect to be obeyed without reluctance; a loyal &s;ubject to be heard without contempt; if the Sovereign's dignity mu&s;t be maintained, the &s;ub|jects grievances mu&s;t be redre&s;&s;ed; the one is le&s;|&s;ened
<PB N="215" REF="013992_0003_0F92591B44F38C30">by an in&s;olent deportment, and the other ag|grivated by cold indifference. The Prince who will not hear information, is a fool; he who per|&s;i&s;ts in &s;pite of it, is a Tyrant.</P>
<P>It is a maxim with us, "that the King can do no wrong;" the re&s;ult of every political evil, is im|puted to his mini&s;ters, but the unthinking Prince who checks Petitions to the throne, ra&s;hly takes every impolitic tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion upon him&s;elf. To this injudicious conduct that weak tyrant Charles the fir&s;t, deluded by his mini&s;terial &s;ycophants, owed his ruin, he fore&s;aw the &s;torm approaching, when it was too late to take &s;helter from its fury, his &s;uf|ferings (and ju&s;t they were) &s;hould be a perpetual le&s;&s;on for crowned heads, but alas! they are kept (if po&s;&s;ible) in infancy all their lives, at their hazard their infamous dependants are to rife; a wi&s;e King would not only open his ears, but his arms, to the information of his &s;ubjects, they are his creators, and they ought to be his guides, they are in truth his only friends.</P>
<P>Till &s;ubjects commence &s;laves, neither weak Kings, nor wicked mini&s;ters, can &s;tand before them, no army is &s;ufficient in a free country, to encounter civil indignation and re&s;entment, iniquity never can prevail till men have lo&s;t their rea&s;on, tho&s;e who dare to think, will dare to act. To injured &s;ubjects the &s;harpe&s;t of all incentives is contempt, the hap|pie&s;t expedient is redre&s;s, the &s;ole right of exerci|&s;ing this lenient mea&s;ure, lies in the brea&s;t of the &s;overeign; if mini&s;ters are wicked he can di&s;card them, if venal parliaments, at the back of a mini|&s;ter, attempt to undermine the con&s;titution, he can di&s;&s;olve them; without proceeding to this extremi|ty,
<PB N="216" REF="013992_0004_0F92591C635D3518">he can, and it is his duty to withhold his a&s;&s;ent whenever any act has improvidently pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, which is likely to be pernicious to the na|tion.</P>
<P>In &s;uch times of corruption and iniquity, every member of the body politic has a right to inform head (the King) of the approaching danger, in &s;uch times, &s;hall a great city be repul&s;ed? If they are to be received with unu&s;ual indignity, &s;uch an intend|ed reception is equal to an actual repul&s;e. That Prince wants wi&s;dom, who is not capable of re|flecting that opulent cities are the vital parts of his dominions, yet what treatment has the city of Lon|don lately met with? have they not been charged with encouraging his Maje&s;ty's <HI>rebellious &s;ubjects</HI> (as they are called) in America? Is it not trea&s;on to encourage traitors? Yet my Lord Mansfield knows that the word (encourage) is the word u&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty, in his an&s;wer to the city petition. Now if &s;ubjects have a right, (and who dare deny it?) to petition the &s;overeign, they are entitled to &s;ome degree of decency, when they approach the throne with a remon&s;trance; becau&s;e the&s;e remon&s;trants are a mo&s;t important part of tho&s;e people to whom the &s;overeign owes his exi&s;tence and continuance. The Maje&s;ty of a people re&s;ides in the collective body, not in a packed majority of &s;muggled repre|&s;entatives in a venal hou&s;e of commons, it is not from the luxurious and corrupt, but from the in|du&s;trious and commercial parts of the kingdom, that this collective body will take its tone, they are the &s;inews of the &s;tate. The rotten commons, and and &s;till more rotten peers, are but as &s;traws floating lightly upon the &s;urface of this great community
<PB N="217" REF="013992_0005_0F92591D01E6D4E8">the&s;e are the bees that make the honey, and tho&s;e the idle drones, that rob the public hives; yet the&s;e alone are the per&s;ons whom the "King delighteth to honour," they alone are received with &s;miles.</P>
<P>The incen&s;e of flattery is grateful, the voice of truth an abomination to the throne, the &s;overeign (tho' not to be &s;urfeited with &s;upplies) is grown &s;ick of information; petitions are therefore to be re|ceived at levees, there they will be handed to a Lord in waiting, (one of the corrupt gang) and neither opened nor heard of afterwards, but when petitions are received upon the throne, a King can|not &s;top his ears; their contents, their reception, and the an&s;wer, are notorious, the whole world may then look on, and either applaud the wi&s;dom, or be a&s;toni&s;hed at the ju&s;tice of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Can tyrants who violate the laws of God, fear the &s;entence of this earthly forum? Is it for this pu&s;illanimous rea&s;on, public remon&s;trances are to be treated like private petitions, pre&s;ented by indig|nant individuals? Are the city of London to be re|ceived like paupers in the corner of a levee? Do they come for alms, or for redre&s;s? Do they come to &s;olicit a pen&s;ion, or to claim a right? Do they &s;ue for the performance of a jobbing contract made with a perfidious mini&s;ter, or for an e&s;tabli&s;hment and due ob&s;ervance in futuro, of that compact made between the crown and the &s;ubject, at the revolu|tion? If they come in the latter &s;hape, the import|ance of their &s;uit demands all the dignity and at|tention of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>If petitions of &s;uch a &s;erious nature, can be baf|fled by a carele&s;s, light reception at a levee of idol|atrous placemen, and needy mendicants, every ave|nue
<PB N="218" REF="013992_0006_0F925921C7F867C0">of hone&s;t information is &s;hut up by the fal&s;e friends of deluded Maje&s;ty; the &s;overeign is &s;till kept in a &s;tate of darkne&s;s and dangerous per&s;eve|rance, for the &s;ake of a mini&s;terial gang of public robbers, at the hazard of the property, lives, and liberties of a whole empire.</P>
<P>The iniquitous proceedings of this atrocious gang in the la&s;t, and pre&s;ent parliament, which they packed, fully ju&s;tify me in branding them with the name of public robbers. Let them look into the black journals of their guilty hou&s;es.&mdash;There they will find that individuals, corporations, electing counties in Great Britain, (not to mention the va&s;t continent of America, and the colonies, merchants and manufacturers, dependent on it) have been deprived of their rights, their liberties, and lives, by that Banditti, who call them&s;elves the King's friends, yet act like enemies to him, and to their country.</P>
<P>The&s;e would open the way (&s;hould they at la&s;t meet with due attention) fir&s;t to their removal from the King's pre&s;ence, and then to fatal enquiries&mdash;To the &s;alvation of Great-Britain and America, and to the puni&s;hment of that infernal Gang of national Parricides. They, on the other hand, fearing only for them&s;elves, wi&s;h to &s;top all acce&s;s to the Sovereign's ear, and evrey appeal to his un|der&s;tanding, or his heart. England cannot look with un|concern upon the &s;ufferings of America. Her claims is ju&s;t, &s;he &s;ays, and &s;he &s;ays truly, that taxation (when it is for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of taking money out of her pocket) and repre&s;entation are, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be reciprocal. In every other re&s;pect &s;he &s;ubmits (as a Colony), to the Legi&s;lature of her Mother country; &s;he &s;ubmits to all tho&s;e laws of England, which affect the general &s;y&s;tem of policy throughout the empire of Great-Britain; but &s;he &s;ays wi&s;ely, that the money which &s;he acquires by the
<PB N="219" REF="013992_0007_0F9259233809D728">&s;weat of her own brow, is not the money of the people of England; and therefore cannot be given away by &s;uch per&s;ons as repre&s;ent the people of England only.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the ca&s;e of America, whom admini&s;tration are labouring to bring under the ab&s;olute yoke of their corrupt parliamentary majority: Unle&s;s they can com|pa&s;s this, they know that neither America, nor Great-Britain (whom they keep like an apple in their jaws, as Hamlet &s;ays, fir&s;t mouthed to be la&s;t &s;wallowed) can be effectually en&s;laved. Unle&s;s America can be ma&s;&s;acred, and her refractory numbers reduced, by &s;word and fa|mine, within a po&s;&s;ibility of controul, &s;he will &s;et a ter|rible example of &s;pirit to her mother country, for whom a net is likewi&s;e already &s;pread. Till America is totally &s;ubdued, the liberties of Great Britain cannot be finally extingui&s;hed. The aim of the pre&s;ent de&s;potic admi|ni&s;tration, and their &s;ervile majority is plain: They wi&s;h to bring America not only under the yoke of our legi&s;|lature, but of their &s;tanding army, with which they will keep them under foot for ever, &s;hould they conquer now. Should they fail in this diabolical de&s;ign; America ri&s;ing from her ruins, will erect an empire of her own; an a&s;y|lum for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of her mother country; who, as they &s;eem at pre&s;ent carele&s;s about the rights, will at la&s;t retain the name of Engli&s;hmen. But &s;hould our parricides &s;ucceed, and America be once &s;ubdued, the whole Briti&s;h empire will in due time be &s;laves. Then will the patriotic &s;cheme of our pre&s;ent virtuous admini&s;tration be compleat; their friend&s;hip to their King, their affection for their country; the vain confi|dence of the one, the well grounded di&s;tru&s;t of the other will appear. The &s;ecret machinations of the cabinet, the &s;uperior wi&s;dom of the Great Council of the nation, will be di&s;clo&s;ed, to the eternal &s;hame and infamy of tho&s;e, who mu&s;t neither pre&s;ume to call them&s;elves Britons nor men, if they long con|tinue thus tamely to petition when they ought to act. Then &s;hall we all de&s;erve the ridicule of the
<PB N="220" REF="013992_0008_0F925923837EDDF0">&s;arca&s;tic Mansfield, and be, in very deed, a tame herd of animals, among whom the wor&s;t of all di&s;tempers (&s;lavery) may be &s;aid to rage; whil&s;t we dare not avail our&s;elves either of our Hoofs, or Horns.</P>

<P>&rindx; <HI>The Authors of the CRISIS pre&s;ent their re&s;pectful compliments to CATO, and return him thanks for his &s;pi|rited addre&s;s to the King, which &s;hall be made the &s;ubject of our next number: The authors fear no tyrant, nor the in&s;truments of tyranny, and they will always pay particu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> attention to the future corre&s;pondence of CATO, who breaths the Godlike &s;entiments of freedom. They embrace this op|portunity of contradicting a most infamous report, no le&s;s indu&s;triou&s;ly than fal&s;ely propagated by the emi&s;&s;aries of the pre&s;ent infernal admini&s;tration. "That the CRISIS was &s;et on foot, and is countenanced by the ministry as a pretence for laying a re&s;traint on the Pre&s;s." The authors beg leave to declare in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, before God and Man, that &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions have not the lea&s;t foundation in truth, and that they are circulated by a tribe of pen&s;ioned ra&s;cals, who are employed to write down truth, and e&s;tabli&s;h fal&s;hood, only with a view to deceive and mi&s;lead the people, and to draw their attention from the true channel of faithful in|formation, and from that destruction with which they are now threatened. The CRISIS was &s;et on foot with a de&s;ign to &s;upport and defend the constitutional rights and privi|leges of England and America, which the authors hold equally dear with their lives. It was &s;et on foot at a time when the liberty of the pre&s;s was nearly destroyed, or ren|dered u&s;ele&s;s by mini&s;terial pro&s;ecutions, a Scotch Chief Justice, and the da&s;tardly &s;ouls of narrow minded Printers, who were afraid to give a tyrant his true appellation. The authors are determined to write like Engli&s;hmen, unawed by fear, or pro&s;ecution, to &s;peak bold truths, &s;uch truths as &s;ome would fear to think. Freedom of &s;peech and writing is one of the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t glorious privileges of a free people: this the authors claim as a right, and this they are firmly re&s;olved to u&s;e and defend: for to this privilege we may again stand indebted, for another REVOLUTION.</HI></P>
