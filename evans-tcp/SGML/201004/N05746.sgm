<HEAD><HI>A Plea for the Poor and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, Again&s;t the BILL</HI> For granting an Exci&s;e upon Wines and Spirits di&s;tilled, &s;old by Retail, or con&s;umed within this Province, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;aid of this Act, that it is intended to cau&s;e &s;uch as &s;pend their Money unnece&s;&s;arily in &s;trong Liquors, luxurious living, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pay &s;ome|thing more than others towards the Support of Go|vernment; whether as a Puni&s;hment, or to re&s;train them, if it could be confin'd only to &s;uch Per&s;ons, the End pro|po&s;ed would be good; and no doubt the good Intention of the Legi&s;lators in pa&s;&s;ing this Bill was &s;uch; but to di|&s;tre&s;s the Poor and Needy could not be intended by it; nor do we &s;uppo&s;e it was to prevent the frugal and nece&s;&s;ary U&s;e of Spirituous Liquors, but to tax the Exce&s;s and un|nece&s;&s;ary U&s;e of them. Therefore (as we have Leave) let us examine and find whether this Act will an&s;wer the propo&s;ed End, without doing more Hurt than Good; and this may be done by comparing the different Manner of Living and Circum&s;tances of three &s;everal Sorts of Per&s;ons in the Province.</P>
<P N="1">1. The prudent, frugal, indu&s;trious hone&s;t Farmers and Hu&s;bandmen, who live in Plenty, Peace and Safety, not acquainted with the Way and Manner that others live.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="007296_0003_102B535134F94F50">2. The poor expo&s;ed &s;uffering People in the Frontiers, labouring and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to Danger, and patiently enduring Cold and Hunger, and many other Hard&s;hips in the Woods, endeavouring to make Settlements for them|&s;elves and their Children, in doing of which they are a Wall, Cover and Defence to the Inland Plantations.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Fi&s;hermen, nece&s;&s;ary and profitable to the Coun|try, who&s;e Labour is great, their Profits little, and their Comforts le&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, tho&s;e Farmers and Hu&s;bandmen living in old Towns and Plantations, who have other Towns &s;ettled out&s;ide them, live and enjoy their Families and E&s;tates in Peace and Safety; they can attend their Bu&s;ine&s;s and La|bours without Fear; they have all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Heavens; every Rain and Dew refre&s;hes the Fruits of their Lands, which bring them plenty of the be&s;t Food and good Raiment as the Earth can produce, and great variety of good Liquors (much better than Rum, the principal Thing aim'd at in this Bill to pay Exci&s;e for) they can and do make excellent Beer, Cider, and a variety of Spi|rituous Liquors, all of the Fruits of their Farms, the Lands, Vines, Trees, Bu&s;hes and Herbs, which with only the Care and Labour of the Hu&s;bandman and his own Family, with no other Expence, produce Plenty of rich Food, Raiment and exhilerating Spirits, equal as to its U&s;efulne&s;s to any in the World. They have it not only in plenty for their own U&s;e, but a great deal to &s;pare, which they &s;ell for Money and enrich them&s;elves.&mdash;They &s;leep quietly in their Hou&s;es, their Fields are well &s;ecured from Danger, every one &s;its quietly under his Vines and Fruit Trees, and none can make them afraid. They hear not (or at lea&s;t they fear not) the Alarm of War; their Per&s;ons, Families and E&s;tates are &s;ecure, protected and defended by the be&s;t Government upon Earth, and Laws which are as a Wall or Fence round about them, that none dare to touch them or theirs to their hurt, but may expect to be &s;everely puni&s;hed.&mdash;The good
<PB N="5" REF="007296_0004_102B5352E25D64D0">
Providence of God has made a Hedge about them in &s;uch Manner as their Civil and Religious Liberties and Privileges are &s;o &s;ecured to them, as there is no Place in any Country, in any Nation or Kingdom, in more happy Circum&s;tances than the&s;e are in; it is much better than the Condition their Fore-Fathers were in, for they in Times pa&s;t had War and Trouble. Then &s;urely the&s;e People who now thus enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven to &s;uch a Degree in all Re&s;pects, would take it as a great Injury done them (and it may be &s;o) to &s;ay of them that they are unwilling to bear a due Proportion according to their Ability, of the Charges of the Support of &s;uch a Government under which they en|joy &s;o much Good: They live as they li&s;t, their E&s;tates are their own, ab&s;olutely their own in Fee. No Lords over them, nor Quit Rents to pay, all are free Men and their E&s;tates free, and they like <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Brethren, <HI>each one re&s;embles the Children of a King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The poor expo&s;ed &s;uffering People in the Fron|tiers, tho&s;e who go into the Wilderne&s;s to clear and &s;ubdue the Lands to make Settlements, are generally very poor, and they mu&s;t &s;uffer great Hard&s;hips and Dangers; the Wilderne&s;s produces them no Corn for Bread, they mu&s;t with great Pains clear the Land before they can till it:&mdash; A little Land takes many Years Labour to &s;ubdue and make it profitable, or in any con&s;iderable Mea&s;ure u&s;eful; and while they are doing that, they mu&s;t &s;uffer for want of Victuals.&mdash;If they can have the Lands given them for clearing and &s;ettling it, they mu&s;t fir&s;t cut their Wood and Timber to &s;ell for Food to &s;upport Life. Many of them are not able to buy Oxen to hale their Wood and Timber to a Landing Place for &s;ale, but are obliged to carry Wood and Timber upon their Shoulders to buy Bread and Cloath|ing for them&s;elves and their Children, ready to faint under their Burdens, yet pre&s;&s;ed on by pinching Want, get &s;omething to fell to relieve them; but then they mu&s;t ven|ture it over Sea for Corn and Pork, and other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and wait the return, which is &s;ometimes long com|ing,
<PB N="6" REF="007296_0005_102B5356487F56B8">
&s;ometimes no return at all; but if they do receive the returns of their Labour, that is perhaps a little In|dian Corn for Bread, and a little lean &s;alt Meat, which may help to keep them alive as long as it la&s;ts; but what is their Drink? Generally in the Woods their Drink is Water, not from good and whol&s;om Springs, but from Rivulets i&s;&s;uing from unwhol&s;om Ponds and Mar&s;hes, of|ten poi&s;oned with Spawns of Toads, Frogs, creeping Things, hateful In&s;ects and Vermine, &s;oaking through Heaths and Box and other poi&s;onous Bogs, Roots and Bu&s;hes, which render the Waters very unwhol&s;om, cau&s;|ing many Sickne&s;&s;es and Deaths.&mdash;And when they have clear'd a few Acres of Land, and can keep a Cow or two, this is &s;omething, but will not &s;upport them, their Depen|dance mu&s;t &s;till be chiefly upon their Lumber for their living, their Lands not yet affording half &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of their Families.&mdash;Then comes War, or a Ru|mour of War; Indians do Mi&s;chief, their Hou&s;es are like weak and defencele&s;s Wigwams, they mu&s;t fly or die; &s;ome get together into &s;mall Huts fenced in with Poles, to &s;ave their Lives, and all they had at home laid Wa&s;te and de&s;troyed.&mdash;To keep in their weak Garri&s;ons without Work, is Death; if they venture out, there is nothing but melancholy A&s;pects, De&s;olations and Fear on every Side; they are in continual Di&s;tre&s;s, the Enemy &s;culking to catch them; the Famine is within their Walls; the Sword of the Wilderne&s;s without; difficult which Death to choo&s;e;&mdash;their Living is without any real Comfort:&mdash; Their Food but mean and &s;canty, their Cloathing rent and torn, &s;carcely &s;ufficient to keep them tolerably warm in the Winter; Wool and Flax they have none, or very little, their Wants are &s;uch as cannot be ea&s;ily expre&s;t; none knows their Sufferings, Fears, Dangers and Sorrows, but tho&s;e who have &s;uffered with them; neither can they them&s;elves expre&s;s it.&mdash;Sometimes, when &s;ome of the&s;e poor Wretches have &s;ome Returns for their Wood and Timber, perhaps they may get a Bottle or Gallon of Rum to drink in the Woods, to prevent the evil Effects of tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="007296_0006_102B5357CC8DC690">
Spawns and noxious Waters, and this is all they can have to drink (and this but &s;eldom) be&s;ides &s;uch Waters; have but little Rum in all they can get; Beer they cannot have, Cider is not there, no Fruit Trees in the Woods and new Plantations; if any rai&s;e a Bu&s;hel of Barley, they mu&s;t eat it or &s;tarve; they cannot &s;pare any for Malt; and now if they drink a Dram of Rum they mu&s;t keep account how much, and where and when they had it, and &s;ware to it, and pay Exci&s;e for it too, or pay &pound;. 10 Law|ful Money, as &s;hall plea&s;e the Deputy Exci&s;e Man.</P>
<P>Now compare the&s;e People's living with the former. Would the meane&s;t Farmer or Hu&s;bandman before-men|tioned exchange Conditions or Livings with any of the&s;e? Surely no.&mdash;Yet Money to &s;upport the Government (if this Bill &s;hould pa&s;s) mu&s;t be taken from the&s;e poor half &s;tarved People, much more than their Proportion ac|cording to their E&s;tates, to ea&s;e the other who live at ea&s;e in &s;afety, and were never acquainted with Hunger or Thir&s;t.&mdash;The Country allows Soldiers in Garri&s;on Beer to drink, if marching Men, a certain Allowance of Rum, which they don't pay Exci&s;e for, be&s;ides their daily Allowance of Bread and Meat. Such Allowance many of the&s;e poor Inhabitants gladly would, but cannot get &s;o much to live upon as well as Soldiers, yet tho' as much expo&s;ed as Soldiers, and more too, they mu&s;t pay Exci&s;e for every Bottle of Rum they or their Families drink, without regarding the nece&s;&s;ity they are under, and without allowing them to live like other Men: The Farmer's Slaves In the Country, live abundantly better than mo&s;t Men in the new Plantations can po&s;&s;ibly live.</P>
<P>Farmers and Hu&s;bandmen have no need of Rum, they have better Liquor and better living in all Re&s;pects, and all of their own rai&s;ing.&mdash;And if they knew or could be made &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;erable Condition, Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their poor Brethren and Neighbours who live in the Frontier Towns, they them&s;elves of meer Compa&s;&s;ion would pay all their Taxes and their Exci&s;e too for them, and let the&s;e poor People go free.&mdash;They would
<PB N="8" REF="007296_0007_102B5359541E7F58">
con&s;ider that &s;ome mu&s;t be out&s;ide next to the Indians, and it is impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t &s;uffer and endure many Hard&s;hips.&mdash;And to add weight to their heavy Burthens, by exacting an Exci&s;e upon them for the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life they u&s;e, &s;uch as Rum, and other &s;pirituous Liquors, to them in the Woods, is extreme hard.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The Fi&s;hermen; their Calling is hone&s;t, and a great Benefit to the Country in many re&s;pects.&mdash;The Fi&s;h and Lumber is all that this Country has of its own Produce, to export and trade with in other Parts of the World, to import Commodities from other Countries which are nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed here, and that the Fi&s;hery ought to be encouraged none will deny.&mdash;The Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s is dangerous, hard and difficult. The Men are always expo&s;ed to the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Pirates at Sea, al&s;o in their open Boats to the Storms, Rocks and Tem|pe&s;ts, many Times not having a dry Garment for many Days or Weeks together; the Sea raging and breaking over them, looks as if they &s;hould be immediately &s;wal|lowed up; they &s;uffer Wet and Cold, and Watching in bad Weather, and when the Weather is fair, the unwhol|&s;om Scent which always attends their Bu&s;ine&s;s from which they cannot go, but mu&s;t endure it and work too, all this will try the &s;tronge&s;t Con&s;titution; and in this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s it is nece&s;&s;ary, and they mu&s;t take a little Rum or other Spirits to keep up their Spirits, or they mu&s;t &s;urfeit or faint in their na&s;ty, tho' nece&s;&s;ary Employment. The&s;e Men, &s;o much expo&s;ed every Day and Hour to the Danger of the Seas, and in Perils which way &s;oever they turn, all Men who are acquainted with that Bu&s;ine&s;s allow, that they need and &s;hould u&s;e more Rum than is nece&s;&s;ary in any other Calling what&s;oever: Yet no Far|mer or Hu&s;bandman would care to exchange Conditions with the&s;e for the &s;ake of their Rum.&mdash;Hu&s;bandmen can lay dry in their Beds in &s;tormy Weather, when Fi&s;hermen are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Weather, they mu&s;t endure it or &s;ink, Wet, Cold and Hunger too, or eat raw Meat, as is
<PB N="9" REF="007296_0008_102B535B753F9B68">
&s;ometimes the Ca&s;e; and notwith&s;tanding all the Fi&s;her|man's Labours and Sufferings and great Pains he takes to live, they are generally very poor and in Debt, all they can get in the Year, will &s;carcely pay the Farmers for Corn and Meat to &s;upply their poor Families in their Ab&s;ence. Let them be ever &s;o indu&s;trious, their Living is but mean and low, yet becau&s;e they drink pretty much Rum, &s;even times their Share of the Support of Govern|ment mu&s;t be laid upon them by Way of Exci&s;e. The&s;e have little or no E&s;tates to be &s;aved or lo&s;t, and tho&s;e that have great E&s;tates &s;afe and &s;ecure from Danger, are thereby ea&s;ed of their Taxes, tho' much better able to pay them.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the Fi&s;hery and Lumber Trade is all that this Country has of its own Produce to trade and purcha&s;e Rum, Salt, Mola&s;&s;es, Cotton, Sugar, Wine and other Nece&s;&s;aries, from all parts of the World where we can Trade; and if tho&s;e who labour in Peril of their Lives, and procure tho&s;e very Things nece&s;&s;ary to carry on our Trade and Merchandize, and procure Rum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have no Liberty to make free U&s;e of what comes by their own painful Labour and Care; they are in wor&s;e Con|dition than were the Oxen in old Times, who&s;e Mouths were not to be muzzel'd when they tread out the Corn.&mdash; All their doleful Circum&s;tances claim Pity and Com|pa&s;&s;ion: And if in&s;tead of taking any Exci&s;e of the&s;e poor People in the Frontiers and Fi&s;hery for the Rum they drink, by an Exci&s;e upon Cider and Malt, there &s;hould be a Soldiers Allowance of Rum and &s;ome other Bounty given to each of them, to encourage them and quicken their &s;low Motions towards their Settlements and Fi&s;hery, this would be more profitable for the Country than this &s;trange &s;ort of Exci&s;e. The Frontiers would be &s;ooner &s;ettled &s;trong and defenceable, and be a Wall to all the inland Parts of the Country, and they within &s;afely rai&s;e Supply for the Fi&s;hery, which would be of great Service to all in every State and Condition in the Country, much
<PB N="10" REF="007296_0009_102B535D8E1C6958">
more than this Exci&s;e will ever be.&mdash;</P>
<P>But here I am aware of an Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That Cider and Malt is their own Produce. An&s;wer, &s;o is Rum as much the Fi&s;hermen and Lumber Men's Work and Pro|duce as that is of the others, and is as much the Blood of the&s;e Men who venture their Lives in Jeopardy for it, as the Water of the Well of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> was the Blood of <HI>David</HI>'s three mighty Men, and &s;hould the&s;e now pay Exci&s;e to favour tho&s;e who never knew Danger?</P>
<P>&rindx; Taxes for the Support of Government is the be&s;t Money we lay out, whatever any may think of it; it is nece&s;&s;ary next to Life it&s;elf, for without Government Life would be but a Burthen; it is a ju&s;t Debt due from every one that lives in and hath the Benefit and Pro|tection of the Government, in Proportion to their Sub|&s;tance kept and &s;ecured to them by it; and to take from the poor and needy to ea&s;e tho&s;e who are able and ought to pay it, it is not equal.</P>
<P>&rindx; The Fi&s;h and Lumber cannot be all u&s;ed here, but is &s;ent to the We&s;t India I&s;lands, and part of the Rum purcha&s;ed by the&s;e Commodities is &s;ent to <HI>Virginia, Ca|rolina,</HI> and other Places, to procure Corn and Pork, to enable them to go on with their Labours and Fi&s;hery, or it mu&s;t cea&s;e, for this Country can't &s;upply them with all Things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tern Frontiers, more than a hundred Miles in length by the Sea (is all that the Province has now to defend) not one Town in it but what lies expo&s;ed both to the Sea and Land Rovers, has been the Seat of War in all Times of War ever &s;ince <HI>New-England</HI> was fir&s;t &s;ettled; every Town except three have been &s;everal Times wholly broken up and de&s;troyed, and laid Wa&s;te many Years, and tho&s;e three have had but a mi&s;erable Life; &s;ometimes one part of a Town de&s;troyed by the Indians, and &s;ometimes another part of the &s;ame, and this
<PB N="11" REF="007296_0010_102B535F9A142D90">
was the Ca&s;e with all the three, always in Fear and in Danger; they could not improve their Lands: Never was any Town in the Country able to rai&s;e &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for their own Inhabitants, by rea&s;on of their continual Troubles: Their Dependance has been and &s;till is in almo&s;t every Town in the Country for their Victuals and Cloaths to be procured by their Lumber and Fi&s;hery, both which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t have fail'd and come &s;hort of a &s;ufficiency: They have not had Times of Peace &s;ufficient to rai&s;e Orchards and Fruit Trees: In a few Years of War their de&s;erted Fields are grown over with Bu&s;hes, and upon re&s;ettling requires new fencing and clearing, and Time to bring it fit to till.&mdash;They need &s;ome Cordial to comfort them in their Labours, which their Lands will not produce. They are glad of poor Food, and drink Water without any Thing el&s;e.&mdash;Then is there any Sin in the nece&s;&s;ary and temperate U&s;e of Rum? Mu&s;t the&s;e be denied the u&s;e of a little Rum, the Fruit of their own Labour, or pay Exci&s;e for it, becau&s;e others have no need of it, but live without it bet|ter than the&s;e can with it?&mdash;Does it hurt any Body for the&s;e to have a little &s;uch Spirits, which the Country think nece&s;&s;ary to allow Soldiers in their Service?&mdash;What Injury is it to tho&s;e who u&s;e little or no Rum them&s;elves, if the&s;e at their own Co&s;t do u&s;e &s;ome?</P>
<P>An Exci&s;e upon Cider and Malt would rai&s;e more Money than this, and as I conceive would be a much better way, for tho&s;e be&s;t able would pay it.&mdash;As to the Method of collecting this new Sort of Exci&s;e, &s;everal have written their Thoughts, take mine al&s;o. Concerning the Behaviour of the Deputy Exci&s;e-Man towards &s;everal &s;orts of Per&s;ons, who mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be examined and &s;worn, as the Exci&s;e-Man or his Deputy plea&s;es, he can exact or di&s;pence with the Oath; he is at Liberty, and tho&s;e &s;ub|jected to his Authority are the Honourable Councellors, the Judges and Magi&s;trates of the Land, the Gentleman Yeoman and Trade&s;man, every Degree, Office and Cal|ling
<PB N="12" REF="007296_0011_102B5361B4F6F1D8">
(except a few Clergymen) Women al&s;o mu&s;t endure a &s;trict Examination, and perhaps an&s;wer to very imper|tinent Que&s;tions, or the unmannerly Deputy will be affronted.</P>
<P>May it not be compared to Popi&s;h Auricular Con|fe&s;&s;ion, or perhaps wor&s;e in &s;ome re&s;pects? for whether they confe&s;s their Sins or not, they are like to &s;uffer &s;e|vere Pennance. A poor labouring Man that in the Cour&s;e of the Year has had eight or ten Bottles or Pints of Rum, more or le&s;s, perhaps given to him by his Employers after faithful Service, to make merry, keeps no Account, nor does he know how to keep any, nor think it nece&s;&s;ary, or it may be neglects it, and forgets whether he had half of it from a Per&s;on licenced or not; he com&s;umes it in his Family, don't expect to be call'd to Account for it, but finds him&s;elf mi&s;taken; when the Exci&s;e Man's Deputy comes, if he likes the poor Man's Wife, he will not like his Account, will not agree with him nor acquit him; it may be the Man cannot &s;ware to any Account; his Exci&s;e perhaps might amount to <HI>One Shilling,</HI> Lawful Money, and no more, yet he is threatned with the Penalty of <HI>Ten Pounds,</HI> that is &pound; 75. old Tenor, which is, it may be, more than &s;uch a Man can get in Sil|ver Money for his Labour in &s;even Years, and to pay that Sum would break up and de&s;troy the Man and his Family. <HI>Ten Pounds,</HI> Lawful Money, is the Penalty, no Chancery in the Matter; none can remit the Fine but the Deputy Exci&s;eman; be this Man never &s;o poor or innocent, he don't &s;ware, and it is the Plea&s;ure of the Exci&s;eman's Deputy that he &s;hall be pro&s;ecuted, who is not worth the Money, nor is he ever like to be able to pay it; the Co&s;t of making any Defence will ruin him, to Pri&s;on he mu&s;t go, and feed the Jaylor, tho' he &s;tarves him&s;elf; his Wife and Children have nothing to eat but his daily Earnings, Partners with him in his Sin in con&s;uming the Bottle of Rum.&mdash;Terrified at the Apprehen&s;ion of his being taken from them, they find the Deputy Exci&s;eman
<PB N="13" REF="007296_0012_102B53639AE94C28">
inexorable, and are almo&s;t driven to De&s;pair.&mdash;Tho' the General Court did not know who would be the Man, they have made Law enough for him to manage and triumph (not as they expected) but as he plea&s;es.&mdash;Then if he in his abundant Lenity &s;hall after much threatning, &s;ignify that the poor Man may be excu&s;ed from a Pro|&s;ecution, and from paying the Fine upon Terms he offers, to &s;ave the Man and his Family from ruin, the poor Woman, who always intended Hone&s;ty, and now had rather continue &s;o than otherwi&s;e; yet, to prevent what &s;he feared would be a wor&s;e Evil, con&s;ents or &s;ubmits to &s;acrifice her Virtue to the letcherous Humour of a brawny Deputy-Exci&s;eman.</P>
<P>This is no uncharitable Surmi&s;e, but natural to &s;up|po&s;e; and I am fully of Opinion, that if this Bill pa&s;&s;es the Seal of the Province, there will be many In&s;tances of this Kind in Town and Country, to the great Di&s;tur|bance of both.</P>
<P>This Act as I apprehend it, is big with many arbitrary Powers, Authorities and Advantages unwarily (not de|&s;ignedly) given to Per&s;ons who the Legi&s;lators know not, nor how they will u&s;e their Authority; the vile&s;t of Men may be recommended, and obtain that Office too late to be remedied, and &s;o this Act may eventually put a Sword into the Hand of a Rogue, to de&s;troy the Poor, and he will doubtle&s;s make U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>No Courts of Judicature have any di&s;pencing Power like this of the Exci&s;eman.&mdash;They are bound to do Ju&s;|tice according to the Laws. They may not &s;ay, this innocent Per&s;on &s;hall be puni&s;hed, and that guilty Per&s;on go free: But all this at the ab&s;olute Will and Plea&s;ure of a De|puty Exci&s;eman may be done, perhaps by &s;uch a Fellow as cau&s;ed the In&s;urrection called <HI>Wat Tyler</HI>'s Rebellion, which co&s;t many thou&s;and Per&s;ons Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007296_0013_102B5366E25B5578">The Governour's di&s;cerning Eye, and fatherly Care of the Province, in not pa&s;&s;ing this Act, is very con&s;picuous, and ought never to be forgotten: It is having Compa&s;&s;ion on this People;&mdash;&s;aving them with Fear, pulling them out of the Fire.&mdash;It is to be hoped, as he had Wi&s;dom to fore&s;ee the evil Con&s;equences of it, and Ju&s;tice with Com|pa&s;&s;ion to &s;tay this Act from taking Effect, that he will &s;till continue his good Will and fatherly Kindne&s;s to|wards the Country, and finally to put a &s;top to this Act; in doing of which, he will, as I imagine, prevent many Evils that otherwi&s;e would unavoidably follow.&mdash;</P>
<P>As the Honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives has pub|li&s;hed part of the <HI>Exci&s;e Bill,</HI> on Purpo&s;e that the Minds of the Inhabitants of the Province concerning it may be known; it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they expect and de&s;ire &s;uch Per&s;ons as do not like the Bill, to let them know their Thoughts about it with freedom: Nothing herein is meant or intended to give Offence to the Hou&s;e, or to any par|ticular Per&s;on, but to &s;hew the Opinion of the Writer, which is call'd for, (however differing from others) it is here publi&s;hed, and he hopes will be favourably inter|preted; and that if any Exci&s;e be granted, it may not ex|tend to private Families, and that tho&s;e poor Per&s;ons in the Frontiers and Fi&s;hery may be excu&s;ed from paying any;&mdash;encouraged in their Bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;and &s;ome better Method found for collecting the Exci&s;e that may be granted;&mdash;which is humbly &s;ubmitted by their Ad|vocate.&mdash;</P>
