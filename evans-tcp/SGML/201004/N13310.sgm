<P>AS the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between Britain and America mu&s;t &s;ooner or later come to period, the future harmony of the pre&s;ent belligerant powers, the general good of both Europe and America, and perpetuating peace on each &s;ide of the Atlantic, will in all probabi|lity greatly depend on the footing on which mat|ters may be put at the treaty of peace; and yet among the various topics repeatedly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the public papers, little or nothing has been &s;aid on this head. It certainly cannot be improper to bring the &s;ubject into view, and excite the public

attention, to a matter of &s;o great moment, in|volving in it, not only every individual of the pre&s;ent generation, but the happine&s;s of ages yet unborn. For this purpo&s;e, the following thoughts are &s;ubmitted to public con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Re&s;pecting territory or dominion. The God of nature, by interpo&s;ing the va&s;t Atlantic between Europe and America, &s;eems evidently to have pointed out the true natural connection of the one with the other, to be by trade and com|merce; and to have forbidden both to exerci&s;e rule or authority, except on their own &s;ide of the ocean. As long, indeed, as any European pow|er holding po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America, treats the in|habitants &s;o that they find their intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s be&s;t &s;ecured and promoted by &s;uch con|nection, &s;o long may that connection be expected to continue, and no longer. Whenever this cea&s;es to be the ca&s;e, that people, if able, will certainly revolt, and &s;et up for them&s;elves; or, if not able, will watch for and embrace the fir&s;t favourable opportunity of extricating them&s;elves from the yoke. This is a principle in nature; and to ex|pect the rever&s;e is equally ab&s;urd as to expect rivers to turn backward, or the ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea to cea&s;e. European &s;overeignty, therefore, as long as it exi&s;ts in America, mu&s;t ever be main|tained by gentle mea&s;ures, engaging the affections of the people, and convincing them of their in|tere&s;t in it. The moment the iron &s;ceptre is &s;ub|&s;tituted in the place of the olive wand, that mo|ment the connection begins to di&s;&s;olve; and by continuing to enforce their authority by violence,
<PB N="5" REF="016825_0005_0F9E828D58080210">
it is eternally broken. Thus it has been between Britain and the American &s;tates; in&s;omuch that were both parties de&s;irous to return to their former connections, it would be in the nature of things impo&s;&s;ible for human wi&s;dom to devi&s;e a plan, which the mutual jealou&s;ies and di&s;tru&s;t unavoidable in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would not utterly and inevitably defeat. Were Britain, therefore, to be influenced &s;olely by a regard to her intere&s;t, without the lea&s;t attention to any other motive, &s;he would endea|vour to &s;ettle matters on that plan which is be&s;t calculated to re&s;tore friend&s;hip, and lay a foun|dation for obtaining advantage by an amicable commercial intercour&s;e; which from the very na|ture of things cannot be expected in any other channel. But to obtain this, and to &s;ettle mat|ters on a &s;olid ba&s;is, &s;he mu&s;t not only allow the independence of the thirteen &s;tates, but mu&s;t re|linqui&s;h all claims of dominion over the part &s;he yet holds on the continent, e&s;pecially her northern po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and allow them to legi&s;late for, and govern, them&s;elves in the manner they may think be&s;t, either in union with the other &s;tates, or &s;eparate from them. And whatever Britain or others may think of it, and whatever means may be u&s;ed to prevent it, to this &s;ituation matters mu&s;t and will come, by the natural and nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of human affairs, before they re&s;t in a per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;tate. The rea&s;ons are obvious; her re|linqui&s;hing her claims of dominion over the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;he holds, would appear to the people as an act of genero&s;ity, and tend to unite them to her commercial intere&s;t, more than any re&s;traint or
<PB N="6" REF="016825_0006_0F9E82901AADAA88">
force could po&s;&s;ibly do, and would at the &s;ame time convince the &s;tates, that &s;he had laid a&s;ide all ho&s;tile de&s;igns again&s;t America: and thus remov|ing all ground of jealou&s;y and apprehen&s;ion of danger, would open a door to mutual friendly in|tercour&s;e; and accompli&s;h by the &s;ubtilty of the fox, what &s;he cannot obtain by the force of the lion. Whereas if &s;he re&s;olve to retain them, her fear of lo&s;ing them, by revolt or otherwi&s;e, will nece&s;&s;arily oblige her to a great expence in forti|fying, keeping up troops, &amp;c. &amp;c. which will probably overbalance all the advantage derived from claiming them as hers; beyond what &s;he might have by a free trade, on the foot of their being their own ma&s;ters. Her &s;trengthening the&s;e places will al&s;o naturally alarm the &s;tates, and per|petuate their jealou&s;y of her having &s;till a de&s;ign to attack them in &s;ome quarter, and prevent re|turn of friend&s;hip. It may al&s;o di&s;quiet the minds of the people thus retained, as though kept like va&s;&s;als, when they &s;ee the &s;tates trade freely to all parts of the world, and them&s;elves confined to Britain; and in proce&s;s of time produce a revolt; and the fortifications Britain had made be turned again&s;t her&s;elf: or &s;hould a war again break out between her and the other maritime powers, &s;ome of them might &s;eize perhaps tho&s;e retained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and deprive her intirely of trade to them afterwards; and be&s;ides, the con&s;equence of her retaining the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions will be, either that dif|ferences and di&s;turbances will ri&s;e between tho&s;e Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and the &s;ubjects of the &s;tates neighbouring &s;o near together, as in the ca&s;e from
<PB N="7" REF="016825_0007_0F9E829118135868">
which my motto is taken; or they will attempt to &s;et up for them&s;elves and become inde|pendant; in either of which ca&s;es, a war will pro|bably en&s;ue, and &s;pread the flame through Eu|rope as well as America; which ought there|fore to be guarded again&s;t, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, by every power that would wi&s;h the pre|&s;ervation of peace. France wi&s;ely fore&s;aw the danger, that might ari&s;e from &s;uch a vicinity of different &s;ubjects; and therefore effectually to pre|vent future differences, interwove in the ground work of the alliance with the &s;tates, a quit-claim to act her former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America; and cer|tainly the danger of differences ari&s;ing between Britain and the &s;tates is far greater, than could in that ca&s;e have been &s;uppo&s;ed. In &s;hort, if Bri|tain retains any part of her American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially to the northward, a peace, whenever made, will not be &s;heathing the &s;word, but lay|ing it by for a &s;ea&s;on, to be pre&s;ently employed again, in the horrid &s;cenes of blood&s;hed, ma&s;|&s;acre and war. The ca&s;e with re&s;pect to Spain to the &s;outhward is very different; there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no animo&s;ity or jealou&s;y; and both they and the &s;tates, have &s;uch a va&s;t &s;cope of yet unexplored country lying behind them, that there is not the lea&s;t probability of any differences ari&s;ing between them, from vicinity.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Solomon. Prov. xii. 20.</HI></BIBL></Q>

<P>THE next object of attention is the fi&s;heries by Nova Scotia, the i&s;lands adjacent, New-foundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. and here it is to be ob&s;erved, that as hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy, and individuals ever find their true intere&s;t in uprightne&s;s, and doing to others as they would wi&s;h to be done to them&s;elves; it is &s;o al&s;o with nations, and their true political intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ts not in making power, but ju&s;tice and right, the rule of their conduct. The path of policy, when viewed in this point of light, and indeed the only true one, is plain and ea&s;y, entirely free from tho&s;e crooked turnings and windings, as fal&s;ly as frequently termed &s;tate policy, and which never fails, &s;ooner or later, to lead to de&s;truction, tho&s;e that walk in them.</P>
<P>On this &s;ure and &s;olid principle alone, I there|fore proceed to ob&s;erve, that the God of Nature has wi&s;ely ballanced to all parts of the habitable earth, their advantages and di&s;advantages; and has &s;o ordered matters, that the wants of one nation are &s;upplied by the redundance of tho&s;e articles in another, and &s;o re&s;pectively throughout the whole: For this end, no doubt, to maintain a
<PB N="9" REF="016825_0009_0F9E82929C2D5D18">
mutual intercour&s;e and exchange of benefits, among the various parts of the great family of mankind; and thus to form a univer&s;al cement, by each contributing to the &s;upply of others, as the members of the body, to the general good of the whole.&mdash;What therefore Nova Scotia, I&s;lands, Newfoundland and States adjacent, &amp;c. might want in other re&s;pects, it has plea&s;ed the great Creator to make up to them in numerous &s;hoals of fi&s;h along their coa&s;t; as evidently de&s;igned in the fir&s;t in&s;tance for their benefit, as the pearl fi&s;hery in the gulf of Per&s;ia is for that people, or the &s;alt on the coa&s;ts of Portugal and the I&s;lands, for the advantage of the inhabitants, or the quails in the wilderne&s;s for the children of I&s;rael; and in the &s;econd, to furni&s;h them with a &s;taple for trade and intercour&s;e with their brethren of mankind; that they might mutually benefit, and be benefited by one another: and accordingly all nations have ever agreed, that the &s;ea, lying along the coa&s;t of a country, with the particular advantages derived from it, as really as the land on which they dwell, belongs to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>On this principle, each European power claims their adjoining &s;ea, and would e&s;teem it an in|tru&s;ion and in&s;ult, &s;hould any others pretend to claim an equal right. And on this univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed principle, when Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1578, made a grant to Sir Humphry Gil|bert, confirming to him, his heirs and a&s;&s;igns for ever, all the lands he might di&s;cover in North America, as far northerly as &s;ixty-eight degrees of north latitude, not already occupied or claimed by any Chri&s;tian power; the adjoining &s;eas were
<PB N="10" REF="016825_0010_0F9E82935A7C9808">
equally granted and confirmed to him as the land; and by virtue of this grant, Newfoundland was &s;ettled, and in King James's fir&s;t and &s;econd charters for Virginia, A. D. 1606 and 1600, comprehending the whole country between the latitudes thirty-four and forty-five, from &s;ea to &s;ea, the adjoinining &s;eas, with the i&s;lands, fi&s;h|ings, &amp;c. are equally and as expre&s;sly granted as the land: and in his third charter, A. D. 1611, this &s;ea extent is particularly mentioned, to the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles.</P>
<P>The right of European powers, to grant lands they never owned, is not now the que&s;tion, but it &s;erves to &s;hew the &s;en&s;e of nations on this head; and as a quit claim to America, again&s;t any European preten&s;ions to fi&s;heries on their coa&s;ts; as whatever claim there was by any European power, Britain had it, and whatever right &s;he had or claimed, &s;he &s;olemnly tran&s;ferred and confirmed to the inhabitants of the country. From all which it evidently appears, that the fi&s;heries on the coa&s;ts of Nova Scotia, and i&s;lands belonging thereto, with Newfoundland, &amp;c. &amp;c. properly belong to the people inhabiting the adjacent land, (otherwi&s;e the great Creator could have ea&s;ily ordered the American &s;inny tribes to the European &s;hoars) and that they cannot in ju&s;tice be deprived thereof, by the intervention of others, any more than of the land on which they are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>If, therefore, matters are allowed to re&s;t on this univer&s;ally acknowledged and confirmed principle, inhabitants coming from whatever part
<PB N="11" REF="016825_0011_0F9E82941CDF53B0">
they may, and &s;ettling in the country, will find employment and &s;upport by the fi&s;heries, and commerce and a free trade will afford an ample &s;upply to others; and things being thus con|ducted in a natural ea&s;y channel, all future occa|&s;ion of war or blood&s;hed from this quarter will be effectually prevented, and a fair and plea&s;ing pro&s;pect opened of permanent peace.&mdash;Whereas, &s;hould any European power engro&s;s the fi&s;hery, be&s;ides the manife&s;t violation of ju&s;tice towards the inhabitants of the adjacent lands or &s;tates, that power would po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch undue advantages over others, not only in the article of fi&s;hing, but in a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen, to encrea&s;e their marine and man their fleets, as to render the &s;afety of their neighbours exceedingly precarious, and per|petually endanger the peace of both Europe and America. Suppo&s;e any one European power to have fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and men employed in the fi&s;hery, as might very readily be, and cer|tainly &s;oon would be, if engro&s;&s;ed by any one, how ea&s;y would it be, for &s;uch power to fit out and man a fleet, that would overturn the liberty of both Europe and America, and give law to all the nations around? and &s;till more &s;o, if that nation &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a great extent of adjacent country, to furni&s;h materials for &s;hip building, &amp;c. whil&s;t on the other hand, if the fi&s;hery be carried on by the inhabitants of the adjacent country, to whom it properly belongs, no &s;uch danger can be ap|prehended, as the idea of invading Europe, or attempting to acquire any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there, would be too ab&s;urd and chimerical, ever to enter the
<PB N="12" REF="016825_0012_0F9E8294D6FAB0C0">
minds of a people, at &s;o great a di&s;tance. This is a matter &s;o deeply intere&s;ting to European powers as well as America, that a regard to their own advantages and &s;afety loudly calls for their mo&s;t &s;erious attention, and utmo&s;t exertions to prevent it.&mdash;And to throw the fi&s;heries open to all, would be in effect confirming them to the few, who are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for their knowlege of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the ca&s;e with which they could interrupt their neighbours, by only altering the &s;ize of their fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, and thereby di&s;|couraging adventurers, would, be&s;ides the flagrant inju&s;tice mentioned above, be opening a door to frequent debates and quarrels, among the &s;ubjects of the different powers, which could not fail to involve them in a war more expen&s;ive, than all the advantage they derived from the fi&s;hing could compen&s;ate. Be&s;ides the nations lying mo&s;t conve|nient, and having the greate&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els, would, in &s;uch ca&s;e, have a peculiar advantage over tho&s;e more remote, and who&s;e marine are not &s;o numerous; and might very probably, after a while, entirely exclude them from any &s;hare. For a few European nations to divide it among them&s;elves, would be equally unju&s;t, and equally dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of their neighbours, and even to their own peace among them&s;elves. There remains, therefore, no pro&s;pect of peace and &s;afety, but in re&s;ting the matter on the true principle above; which the intere&s;t of both Europe and America, if duly con&s;idered, on the large &s;cale of mutual advantage and perpetuated peace, will mo&s;t certainly lead them to adopt.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016825_0013_0F9E8297D04FCFD0">It has been alledged, that the affair of the fi&s;hery will be &s;ettled by the powers now at war, when a peace comes to be made: but it ought to be con&s;idered, that it belongs not to any of them to di&s;po&s;e of them, unle&s;s by an act of violence, and confidence in their power to the &s;ubver&s;ion of ju&s;tice and right.</P>
<P>Britain, France, and the &s;tates, may di&s;po&s;e of their own property as they &s;ee meet; but may not in ju&s;tice meddle with that of others. The fi&s;h|eries on the banks of Nova Scotia, i&s;lands adja|cent, Newfoundland, &amp;c. belong to the inhabi|tants there, by the grant of the great creator; and the European claim, &s;uch as it was, transferred and confirmed them to them. If any alledge, the&s;e places belong to Britain, and &s;he may di&s;po&s;e of them as &s;he may think proper; I reply, the char|ter for Newfoundland (as mentioned above) con|firms to the inhabitants there a right to both land and &s;ea, not to be revoked or forfeited; and whatever part that people may act, either towards the &s;ubjects of Britain or others, all that Britain can do, according to the expre&s;s declaration of the charter, is to declare them "out of the allegi|ance and protection of Britain; and to be no lon|ger avowed, maintained or defended by her;" but may not rob them of their ju&s;t natural or acquir|ed rights. And the grant for the &s;ettlement of Nova Scotia was <Q>unconditional, ab&s;olute, and without any exception or re&s;ervation what&s;oever; or where&s;oever, of all rights royalties, privi|ledges, franchi&s;es, &amp;c. both by &s;ea and land, and likewi&s;e the power of goverment, by laws
<PB N="14" REF="016825_0014_0F9E8297DDE73A48">
to be made by their own legi&s;latures,</Q> was given for encouraging the &s;ettlement of the country, which would have been the true intere&s;t of Britain, to have &s;trictly adhered to and fully complied with: and therefore the people con&s;ider them&s;elves, equally entitled to their lands and coa&s;ts, and to as free a government of their own, from under the controul of any other, as any of the American &s;tates; and hope through the ble&s;&s;ing of God to maintain it: and hence it is that though their me|metropolis has been held by the Briti&s;h through the pre&s;ent war; and their &s;trength is not &s;uffici|ent to free them&s;elves as yet of the impo&s;ition, they have notwith&s;tanding taken no active part on that &s;ide, but wait for a favorable &s;ea&s;on of deliver|ance, and to a&s;&s;ert their &s;overeignty, independent freedom and ju&s;t rights in&s;eperably connected there|with. Upon the whole, &s;hould peace be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the above foundation, it will open the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of a long uninterupted &s;eries of tranqui|lity to both Europe and America, all ground of di&s;quiet and di&s;turbance being entirely removed. But if matters be unhappily &s;ettled on the footing of Britain retaining any part of American po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially to the northward, and the fi&s;h|eries to be monopolized by one, or divided among more, or fewer of the European powers, whether the &s;tates have a &s;hare or not, it mu&s;t appear evident on a &s;mall degree of reflection, the i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be, in all probability, another war in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, involving in it the inhabitants on both &s;ides the atlantic, which the true intere&s;t of

To this I reply, that we are at lea&s;t twelve months behind in information on the &s;ubject; and &s;hould the terms on which we ought to &s;heath the &s;word become the topic of occa&s;ional conver&s;ation, for the whole time; we &s;hould not be too well prepared for entering on the bu&s;ine&s;s: and I think the political &s;tate of Eu|rope, make overtures probable by the clo&s;e of the campaign. The object is large and very exten|&s;ive, embracing the intere&s;ts not only of the bel|ligerent powers, but of every principal &s;tate in Europe as well as America. We are young and not over expert in the knowledge of every national concern: all men can &s;ee what fate mu&s;t await us, if we di&s;cover as little &s;kill in negociation as in finance, or many other objects of public attention. It is not uncommon, for a nation to recover, by the terms of pacification, as much as &s;he lo&s;t by the &s;word; and tho' the war be unfortunate, the peace may be advantageous. It requires a man to be well acquainted with the circum&s;tances and intere&s;ts of his own nation, and of tho&s;e powers with whom he may either formally or eventually be connected,
<PB N="17" REF="016825_0017_0F9E829A90E48620">
as well as tho&s;e of the enemy, to be qualified to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a negociation for peace. Whenever that event takes place, if the terms be good and pro|per for America, &s;he may enjoy perpetual tran|quility, and be on terms of amity and friend&s;hip with every nation, which may vi&s;it her coa&s;ts, or enter her ports; and it is plain therefore that the pacification mu&s;t comprehend the general and common intere&s;ts of all. But if the terms be not &s;uch as comprehend all, &s;he &s;tands a very great chance to change enemies; but never to enjoy untroubled &s;ecurity. Dear bought experience has taught us to know, that the &s;calping knife and tomahawk are equally employed, to butcher our innocent back &s;ettlers, while any nation po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es territory either to the ea&s;tward, or in any other quarter, on this &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. Ca|nada, Nova Scotia, and Loui&s;iana, in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of France or Great Britain, are alike ho&s;|tile to America; and &s;he could never be &s;afe in the neighbourhood of either.</P>
<P>France, who&s;e motives will appear the more ju&s;t, and mea&s;ures more generous and di&s;inter|e&s;ted, the more they are examined, has wi&s;ely ceded all her claims on the&s;e countries. Had &s;he di&s;covered any reluctance on this head, &s;he would have &s;own the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;o|lution in the very vitals of the treaty of amity, into which &s;he has entered with the American States. By cheerfully relinqui&s;hing her claim, &s;he has removed all cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s, and de|&s;troyed every apprehen&s;ion of &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns, and united them to her for ever: but as much as it is
<PB N="18" REF="016825_0018_0F9E829AF8D32E20">
her intere&s;t and theirs to be on terms of friend&s;hip with each other, &s;o much it is the intere&s;t of both, that Britain retain no claim to any part of the&s;e countries; and a peace without our inde|pendence and connexion with them, would only be the cau&s;e of new wars, and involve both in the repetition of their pre&s;ent troubles and ex|pence: for Britain to be our neighbour is to have Britain our enemy. No proverb more true than that, "He who injures, can never forgive," and Britain having once injured, can never forgive America. To live at peace, therefore, with each other, Briti&s;h power mu&s;t be as far removed from us as her i&s;lands are: this therefore, though too little thought of, is a point of the la&s;t con&s;e|quence; but there is one other, perhaps le&s;s attended to, which is yet of more importance, and on the right &s;ettlement of which, the free|dom and exten&s;ion of our commerce will greatly, if not principally, depend; and it is a point, which is equally intere&s;ting to every European power, who&s;e &s;ubjects either are, or may become mer|chants, and who wi&s;h to feel the enriching in|fluence of commerce: this is to prevent any European power claiming any &s;hare in our fi&s;h|eries, and to guarantee them only to the inhabitants of the adjacent &s;tates, to whom they properly belong, as may appear more fully from the pre|ceding numbers.&mdash;Britain u&s;urping it, became mi&s;tre&s;s of the ocean, and &s;o would any other European power. America po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, becomes only an object of a more exten&s;ive and lucrative commerce, which mu&s;t appear evident to every
<PB N="19" REF="016825_0019_0F9E829BA5798950">
intelligent per&s;on. Every part of America is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a landed &s;taple commodity; excepting that, on the coa&s;ts of which, fi&s;h are caught in the greate&s;t abundance; to them Nature &s;eems to have allotted this &s;taple, and by means of it to connect them with the di&s;tant nations: fixing peace on the&s;e principles, America becomes the com|mon mart of Europe, where every one will find the article he wants, and the purcha&s;er of what he has to di&s;po&s;e of.&mdash;But divide it between any foreign powers, in whole, or in part, quarrelling, confu&s;ion and animo&s;ity will be the uncea&s;ing con&s;equence. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in common of any pro|perty, which can be improved and enjoyed, is as impo&s;&s;ible among nations, as among individuals. The weaker mu&s;t always &s;uffer, and the advan|tages in trade, which the European powers will po&s;&s;e&s;s, who do not al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s a full &s;hare in the fi&s;hery, will be very &s;mall, and to divide it a|mong&s;t all, would be to &s;ow the &s;eeds of conti|nual contention, and in a great mea&s;ure to defeat their intentions, in wi&s;hing our independence, and often involve us in di&s;agreeable altercations.&mdash; They, who have the land, can alone enjoy and improve the fi&s;hery to general and equal advan|tage: Europe will be their market, and Europe will reap the benefits of their traffic; a general circuitous and very profitable trade will be the con&s;equence, and no one power will po&s;&s;e&s;s any naval advantage over another. The ju&s;tne&s;s and genero&s;ity of the policy of France, in relinqui&s;h|ing all claims to the land, leaves no room to doubt of their acting on the &s;ame principles, with
<PB N="20" REF="016825_0020_0F9E829C5BDB5900">
regard to the fi&s;hery, whenever applied to, on the &s;ubject; and the haughty and imperious conduct of Britain to the mercantile and neutral powers of Europe, &s;hews plainly what they are to expect from her, &s;hould &s;he continue to derive the &s;up|plies of &s;eamen from the fi&s;hery, which &s;he has hitherto done.</P>
<P>It is therefore the intere&s;t of all Europe to turn their eyes to this object, and to oblige Britain to give up every preten&s;ion thereto. On this head, the &s;tipulations ought to be very clear and deci|&s;ive; and that power alone &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it becomes an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of general advantage to all, without proving a bone of contention to any. Let them act wi&s;ely, and they will reap plentifully, but neglecting the pre&s;ent opportunity, they will one day feel the folly of their inattention.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude by ob&s;erving to tho&s;e powers that are in pur&s;uit of imaginary honour, that in a righteous cau&s;e, and the ju&s;t defence of a man's country, all actions of valour are indeed ju&s;t rea&s;ons of prai&s;e; but in all other ca&s;es, victory and conque&s;t are no more than murder and rapine; and every one is to be dete&s;ted as the greate&s;t enemy to mankind, that is mo&s;t active herein. Tho&s;e are only true heroes, who mo&s;t benefit the world, by promoting the peace, wel|fare, and good of mankind: but &s;uch as oppre&s;s it with the &s;laughter of men, de&s;olation of coun|tries, the burning of cities, and the other cala|mities which attend war, are the &s;courges of God, and the greate&s;t plagues and calamities that
<PB N="21" REF="016825_0021_0F9E829D29F74170">
can happen to it; <HI>and</HI> which are never &s;ent into the world but for the puni&s;hment of it; and therefore ought, as &s;uch, to be prayed again&s;t, and dete&s;ted by all mankind.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the great, and Julius Cae&s;ar, were two of the mo&s;t eminent conquerors perhaps to be met with in hi&s;tory, yet their victories and and conque&s;ts were &s;o far from being advantages to them, that on the contrary they terminated in their death and ruin, the whole royal families of Philip king of Macedon, and of Alexander the the great his &s;on, were utterly extirpated within the &s;pace of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> years; (reckoning from the 334th year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Chri&s;t, when Alexander entered upon his exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">tion again&s;t Darius;) and they, their wives, and all that were de&s;cended of them, died violent deaths. Thus the&s;e two kings, who by their oppre&s;&s;ive and de&s;tructive wars had made many tragedies in the families of other prin|ces, and people, had them all at length, by the ju&s;t ordination of providence, brought home to their own.</P>
<P>Julius Cae&s;ar fought fifty battles without mi&s;&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s in any one of them, unle&s;s at Pharus, where he &s;wam for his life; and once at Dyrra|chium, and in the&s;e battles he is &s;aid to have &s;lain one million one hundred and ninety two thou|&s;and men; which proves him to have been the great cut-throat of the age in which he lived. What is the fruit he reaped from the&s;e victories? His own blood is &s;hed in the &s;enate, being &s;lain there, even by &s;ome whom, he had mo&s;t highly obliged: and dying childle&s;s, his nephew Octavius,
<PB N="22" REF="016825_0022_0F9E829E18225070">
whom he had adopted, &s;wam to the empire al&s;o in torrents of blood; and at length left it to the po&s;terity of Authony, whom he had conquered: for none of Octavius's (i. e. Augu&s;tus's) po&s;terity ever enjoyed the empire. The&s;e bloody men were rai&s;ed up, in the holy and righteous provi|dence of God, as &s;courges in his hand, for the puni&s;hment of the wickedne&s;s of the age in which they lived; the work was God's; but it being malice, revenge and ambition, that excited them to be the in&s;truments in the execution of it, they ju&s;tly had for ther reward thereof that de&s;truction by which they fell; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> reputed the greate&s;t pe&s;ts and plagues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> kind. But &s;uch is the folly of men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, that they u&s;ually make the actions of war, blood&s;hed, and conque&s;t, the &s;ubjects of their highe&s;t encomiums; and tho&s;e their mo&s;t celebrated heroes, that mo&s;t excel therein.</P>
<P>I &s;hall further add, that neither Britain nor France, can expect to hold any part in America, but by &s;hedding of innocent blood and lo&s;s of the affection of the people. Let people therefore from every quarter of Europe, come and &s;ettle in America, there can he no cau&s;e of complaint when all people of fair moral characters, from every quarter, will meet with equal encourage|ment. What can Europe have to fear from a num|ber of their own people? Nor will there be any great danger of any one &s;tate, injuring another; as by their &s;everal con&s;titutions, &s;uch a quick rota|tion of their officers of government, will prevent their forming plans or &s;chemes, again&s;t either

<P>Your true intere&s;t, therefore, appears to be only trade and commerce, which can be no other way obtained, but by gaining the good will of the people. By that means millions, may be made annually, which will be vain to expect from any other plan of murder and &s;hedding of inno|cent blood. We will therefore, if you plea&s;e, enter into a treaty with you, and with all man|kind, of la&s;ting friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The many and great advantages in trade and commerce, which European powers in general, and the maritime in particular, will derive from

their adopting &s;uch a plan, are very obvious; which, with the di&s;advantages that will unavoid|ably attend a contrary conduct, &s;hall be the &s;ubject of &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent numbers.</P>
<P><HI>Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witne&s;s between me and thee. That I will not pa&s;s over to thee, and that thou-&s;hall not pa&s;s over unto me for harm,</HI> Gene&s;is xxxi. 44, 52.</P>
