<HEAD>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN circum&s;tances of extraordinary danger or alarm, ex|traordinary mea&s;ures mu&s;t be adopted: for ordinary means are incompetent for extraordinary occa&s;ions. Tho' I may not kill a man, while I am in no danger from him; yet if he be in the act to kill me, or I find him breaking into my hou&s;e, in the night-time to rob me, I may put him to death. This re&s;ults from the general law of &s;elf-defence. The &s;acred right of property will not forbid us, when a hou&s;e is on fire, to pull down the adjacent buildings, to &s;ave the re&s;t of the town.&mdash;Nor will the right of per|&s;onal liberty re&s;train the magi&s;trate from committing to gaol a man who has actually done no mi&s;chief, if another is ju&s;tly afraid of mi&s;chief being done by him. All the&s;e are extraordinary ca&s;es, to which the ordinary rules of pro|perty, or of per&s;onal liberty and &s;afety, are not applicable: and the violation of tho&s;e rules, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is, in true con&s;truction, no violation of them: for they were never meant to be applied to &s;uch ca&s;es, but only to the ordinary and peaceful &s;tate of &s;ociety, and mu&s;t yield to the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and common welfare.</P>
<P>Nations, like individuals, are al&s;o bound, by the law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, in times of danger, to adopt mea&s;ures, which would be altogether unju&s;tifiable in ordinary times. They may de&s;troy an ho&s;tile army. If a ho&s;tile army be &s;uffered to march through a neutral country, to attack a|nother nation, this nation may al&s;o enter that country,
<PB N="2" REF="035077_0003_1000A2B6114BA490">and oppo&s;e its enemy. If fields, gardens, hou&s;es, or towns, &s;helter its enemy from the full force of attack, they may be de&s;troyed. If it be nece&s;&s;ary to weaken the enemy by want, the corn, cattle, and all kinds of provi&s;ion may be carried off, and the frontier made, as it were, a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">art. Such things are, in times of danger, ju&s;tifiable by the law of &s;elf-defence; though, in ordinary times they would be unlawful and inhuman. On the &s;ame principles of &s;elf-defence, to prevent a dangerous communication of intelli|gence, or any mea&s;ure unfavourable to its &s;afety, when a nation is, or is likely to be, engaged in war, it may order any aliens, who may be &s;u&s;pected of promoting or favouring the de&s;igns of its enemy, to depart out of its territory.&mdash; This may be always, and has been generally done. And, unle&s;s where this right is regulated by treaty, this may be done at the di&s;cretion of the government under which the aliens re&s;ide. For every government mu&s;t be &s;ole judge of what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, for its own &s;afety or advan|tage, within its own territory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vattel. L. of N. Prel. &s;ect. <HI>17, 20.</HI> B. <HI>2,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>94.</HI></NOTE>. And, even with re&s;pect to their own &s;ubjects, mo&s;t governments have re&s;erved a right, without being required to &s;hew any cau&s;e, to commit to clo&s;e cu&s;tody any &s;ubject &s;u&s;pected as dangerous to the peace or welfare of the community. In England, this right is re&s;trained by the writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> which gives to every &s;ubject impri&s;oned an opportunity of requiring the cau&s;e of his commitment, and of obtaining, in all proper ca&s;es, his enlargement. When, therefore, the King of Britain's mini&s;ters find it nece&s;&s;ary, for political rea&s;ons, to re&s;train the per&s;onal liberty of any &s;ubject, without &s;hewing any cau&s;e for it, a law mu&s;t be obtained from Parliament, &s;u&s;pending the privilege of the writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus;</HI> and Parliament may, whenever it plea&s;es, pa&s;s &s;uch a law.</P>
<P>Conforming to the principles of liberty inherited from our ance&s;tors, the privilege of the writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as a principle, in the government of this State and of the Union<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">U. S. Cor&s;t. Art <HI>1,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>8.</HI> Penn. Con&s;t. Art. <HI>9,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>14.1</HI> U. S. L. <HI>101.2</HI> St. L. <HI>241.</HI></NOTE>. And, though Congre&s;s or the Gen|eral
<PB N="3" REF="035077_0004_1000A2CA25BF8748">A&s;&s;embly may, re&s;pectively, like the Briti&s;h Parliament, by law, &s;u&s;pend this privilege; yet they cannot, like the Briti&s;h Parliament, pa&s;s &s;uch law whenever they plea&s;e. For the Federal and State Con&s;titutions have declared, that "The privilege of the writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> &s;hall not be &s;u&s;pended unle&s;s when, in ca&s;es of rebellion or in|va&s;ion, the public &s;afety may require it." So that, in this country, no citizen can be deprived of his liberty, with|out an avowed and &s;ufficient cau&s;e, unle&s;s, in ca&s;e of rebellion or inva&s;ion, the legi&s;lature think the public &s;afe|ty requires it, and &s;u&s;pend the privilege of the writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus.</HI> But here the Con&s;titution leaves aliens, as in other countries, to the protection of the general princi|ples of the law of nations, or of the particular provi&s;ions of treaties made between the United States, and the govern|ment who&s;e &s;ubjects or citizens the aliens &s;everally are.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in its la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, found the United States in extraordinary circum&s;tances of peril, unequalled &s;ince their Independence was &s;olemnly acknowledged. France, hav|ing, without any re&s;pect to the principles of liberty, the law of nations, or the rights of individuals, plundered the land to the utmo&s;t reach of her gra&s;p; extended the &s;ame unprincipled rapacity to the ocean, and plundered indi&s;crim|inately friends and foes. Of all nations and governments none had with more affection regarded the revolution of France, none had more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated her friend&s;hip, none had more &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved the rules of neutral|ity, or, con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e rules, partially indulged the views of France; than the nation and government of the United States. And if neutrality, ju&s;tice, affection, and gratitude, could have exempted any government and nation from injury from France, the nation and government of the United States might ju&s;tly have claimed this exemption. But what weight has ju&s;tice, with a government without principle, without religion, and without an intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the people over which it is placed! If the French government had regarded only the intere&s;t of France, it would have cultivated the affections of America. But the French government, like the fal&s;e mother indiffer|ent
<PB N="4" REF="035077_0005_1000A296AF4FADD8">to the life of the child, regarded not the intere&s;t of the French nation, but the indulgence of its own pa&s;&s;ions, and the triumph of its own pride, which, exalted by &s;ucce&s;s, beyond the bounds of moderation, &s;ought to humble all authorities in univer&s;al pro&s;tration at its feet. She commenced and pro&s;ecuted &s;poliations of our trade to an extent that threatened its ruin: and the di&s;mal effects are di&s;played in the bankruptcies of our merchants, and the langui&s;hing &s;tate of our commerce and agriculture. The American government patiently and peacefully &s;ought redre&s;s by negotiation; but the pre&s;umption and rapacity of France ro&s;e in proportion to the patience and peace of America; and, with unexampled in&s;olence, &s;he repeatedly drove away our amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent to claim only an exemp|tion from injury, and apayment of ju&s;t debts; required us, by an ignominious tribute and bribe, to double the damage we had &s;uffered; and threatened us, if we refu&s;ed this, with war and ravage on our coa&s;ts, burning of our towns, and even di&s;&s;olution as a nation.</P>
<P>What could have &s;welled the in&s;olence of France to this pitch of extravagance? Had we done her any injury? She can &s;hew none. Was it her great &s;ucce&s;s, and mighty power? We are at a di&s;tance to defy her power. How then dared &s;he thus to in&s;ult and injure us? She accounted us a divided people, &s;plit into factions, among which &s;he had zealous partizans. In this &s;tate, &s;he knew, we mu&s;t be an ea&s;y prey: in this &s;tate, &s;he knew, we could make no re&s;i&s;tance. And, while we remained in this &s;tate, &s;he might &s;afely per&s;i&s;t in her proud oppre&s;&s;ion: and &s;he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;o. For men, without regard to religion and ju&s;tice, <HI>will</HI> do whatever they <HI>can</HI> do: and nothing but re&s;i&s;tance and force will re&s;train them from injuring others. France had long known and promoted divi&s;ions and factions among us. And had &s;ent &s;pies into all parts of our country, to procure information of our circum&s;tances and opinions.&mdash; The&s;e travelled through America, under various pretexts, of curio&s;ity, of philo&s;ophy, or of avoiding tyranny or per|&s;ecution at home. This Talleyrand, who demanded the bribe and loan from our amba&s;&s;adors, travelled through America as an emigrant; and, after his return to France,
<PB N="5" REF="035077_0006_1000B5838893F410">was appointed mini&s;ter of foreign affairs. From its &s;pies and other agents here, the French government received con&s;tant intelligence of the &s;entiments of the citizens, and the mea&s;ures of the government of America; and was thus prepared to promote its own views, and defeat ours.</P>
<P>If ever there was a time in which it was proper for any government, to order aliens to depart out of its territory, it was proper for the American government to do &s;o at this time. In other countries, this would have been done by a proclamation of the Executive. This was a new ca&s;e under the American Con&s;titution, and proper for the in|terference of the legi&s;lature.&mdash;Congre&s;s, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed a law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>25th</HI> June, <HI>1798&mdash;5</HI> U.S.L. <HI>143.</HI></NOTE>, the &s;ub&s;tance of which, in its own words, I &s;hall here &s;tate,&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>"It &s;hall be lawful for the Pre&s;ident of the United States, to order all &s;uch aliens, as he &s;hall judge dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States, or &s;hall have rea&s;on|able grounds to &s;u&s;pect, are concerned in any trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations against the government thereof, to depart out of the territory of the United States, within &s;uch time, as &s;hall be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch order.&mdash;Which order &s;hall be &s;erved on &s;uch alien, by delivering him a copy thereof, or leav|ing the &s;ame at his u&s;ual abode, and be returned to the office of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, by the mar&s;hal or other per&s;on to whom the &s;ame &s;hall be directed."</HI></P>
<P>But "<HI>if any alien &s;o ordered to depart &s;hall prove, to the &s;atisfaction of the Pre&s;ident, by evidence to be taken before &s;uch per&s;ons as the Pre&s;ident &s;hall direct, that no injury or danger to the United States will ari&s;e, from &s;uffering him to re&s;ide therein, the Pre&s;ident may grant a licence to &s;uch alien to remain within the United States, for &s;uch time as he &s;hall judge proper, and at &s;uch place as he &s;hall de&s;ignate.&mdash; And the Pre&s;ident may al&s;o require of &s;uch alien to enter into bond to the United States, in &s;uch penal &s;um as he may direct, with one or more &s;ufficient &s;ureties, to the &s;atisfaction of the per&s;on authorized by the Pre&s;ident to take the &s;ame, condi|tioned for the good behaviour of &s;uch alien during his re&s;idence in the United States, and for not violating his licence; which
<PB N="6" REF="035077_0007_1000A3A948410D68">licence the Pre&s;ident may revoke whenever he &s;hall think proper.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>And if any alien, &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdered to depart, &s;hall be found at large within the United States, after the time limited in &s;uch order for his departure, and not having a licence from the Pre&s;ident to re&s;ide therein; or having obtained &s;uch licence, &s;hall not have conformed thereto; every &s;uch alien &s;hall, on conviction thereof, be impri&s;oned for a term not exceeding three years, and &s;hall never after be admitted to become a citizen of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>This law further enacts, <HI>"That it &s;hall be lawful for the Pre&s;ident of the United States, whenever be may deem it nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;afety, to order to be removed out of the territory thereof any alien who may be in pri&s;on in pur&s;uance of this act; and to cau&s;e to be arrested, and &s;ent out of the United States, &s;uch of tho&s;e aliens as &s;hall have been ordered to depart therefrom, and &s;hall not have obtained a licence as afore&s;aid, in all ca&s;es, where, in the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, the public &s;afety requires a &s;peedy removal. And if any alien, &s;o removed, or &s;ent out of the United States by the Pre&s;ident &s;hall voluntarily return thereto, unle&s;s by permi&s;&s;ion of the Pre&s;ident of the United States; &s;uch alien, on convic|tion thereof, &s;hall be impri&s;oned as long as, in the opinion of the Pre&s;ident, the public &s;afety may require."</HI></P>
<P>But it is provided, <HI>"That it &s;hall be lawful for any alien, who may be ordered to be removed from the United States, by vritue of this act, to take with him &s;uch part of his goods, chattles, or other property, as he may find conve|nient; and all property left in the United States by any alien who may be removed, as afore&s;aid, &s;hall be &s;ubject to his di&s;po&s;al."</HI></P>
<P>One would have thought, that a law &s;o rea&s;onable in it|&s;elf, &s;o conformable to the law of nations, and the practice of all governments, and, while it is altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;afety and defence of the United States; if it did not obtain all prai&s;e, would, at loa&s;t, have e&s;caped all cen&s;ure. Yet this law was not only vehemently oppo&s;ed in Congre&s;s; but, even &s;ince it was pa&s;&s;ed, has been reprobated by ignorant, or wicked and &s;editious men; and, for their vile and &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="035077_0008_1000B585AE273368">has been held up to dete&s;tation, as uncon&s;titutional and ty|rannical. In many parts of the Union, it has been u&s;ed as a pretext and in&s;trument, to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, di&s;turb the peace of the country, de&s;troy re&s;pect for the laws, and relax the authority of the government; and, in one State, to produce &s;uch a commotion, as threatens an in&s;urrection, if not a &s;eparation from the Union.</P>
<P>It is proper for men in all &s;tations, and peculiarly in my &s;tation, to endeavour to counteract &s;uch mi&s;chievous pa&s;|&s;ions, and mi&s;erable con&s;equences. With this view, I &s;hall examine the objections, which I have ob&s;erved to have been offered again&s;t this law &s;olemnly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the authority of the United States.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is objected to this law, that it is contrary to the expre&s;s words of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We perhaps ought not to wonder, that this objection is made. Added to the want of &s;en&s;e and knowledge in &s;ome or the objectors, of mode&s;ty in mo&s;t of them, and the gen|eral di&s;po&s;ition, from prejudices excited and nouri&s;hed by &s;lander, to believe every act of admini&s;tration wrong; the habit of oppo&s;ition prepares their minds to make and re|ceive it. For a habit of oppo&s;ing every thing makes dreadful havoc, not only on the feelings and con&s;cience, but on the under&s;tanding it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This objection is made on two grounds.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that the Con&s;titution declares, that "the migration or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons, as any of the States now exi&s;ting, &s;hall think proper to admit, &s;hall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be prohibited by Congre&s;s, prior to the year one thou&s;and eight hundred and eight; but a tax or duty may be impo&s;ed on &s;uch importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each per&s;on<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art.</HI> 1. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 9.</NOTE>." From this it is inferred, that, as Congre&s;s can|not yet prohibit &s;uch migration or importation, they canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remove the per&s;ons, who have migrated or been imported for this, it is &s;aid, would be, in effect, prohibiting the mi|gration or importation.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the prohibition in view, re&s;pected only &s;laves. This was univer&s;ally under&s;tood, at the time
<PB N="8" REF="035077_0009_1000A2983321B8C0">of the publication of the Con&s;titution, during its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and ever &s;ince. All the members of the Convention know this. The Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of Congre&s;s, who was a member of the Convention, did, in the argument on this bill, in a committee of that hou&s;e, expre&s;sly declare this to have been the avowed &s;en&s;e of the Convention, on this clau&s;e of the Con&s;titution; and no man, of any knowledge of the &s;ubject, has ever &s;eriou&s;ly entertained a doubt of this. The Convention was &s;o aver&s;e to the traffic in human beings, that they would not directly name &s;laves, &s;lavery, or the &s;lave-trade. The &s;outhern members thought their States not yet prepared for the prohibition of this traffic. The other members agreed to give tho&s;e States twenty years to think of it. In that &s;pace, they would probably aboli&s;h the &s;lave-trade them&s;elves; or, after that, Congre&s;s might do it. In the mean time, the Convention would not give &s;lavery the &s;anction of being expre&s;sly named. In&s;tead of the word <HI>&s;laves,</HI> the word <HI>per&s;ons</HI> was u&s;ed; and, to corre&s;pond with this, the word <HI>migration,</HI> and explanatory of this, the word <HI>importation,</HI> as more properly applicable to &s;laves, or <HI>per|&s;ons</HI> con&s;idered, not as aliens, but as <HI>property.</HI> Or con&s;i|dering this prohibition as re&s;pecting only &s;laves, we find another rea&s;on for this con&s;truction, in the power re&s;erved to Congre&s;s "to impo&s;e a tax on &s;uch <HI>importation;</HI>" while no &s;uch power is expre&s;&s;ed as to migration; and thus for con&s;truing tho&s;e words as meaning a different manner of introducing &s;laves. Congre&s;s is re&s;trained from prohi|biting their <HI>importation</HI> by &s;ea, or their <HI>migration</HI> by land, into any of the States; but may &s;ay a duty on their fir&s;t. importation, not on any &s;ub&s;equent migration; the duty in that ca&s;e being pre&s;umed to have been paid before.&mdash; While the prejudices or nece&s;&s;ities <HI>of the State then exi&s;ting</HI> were thus indulged; the Convention confined this indul|gence to them, and did not re&s;train Congre&s;s from prohi|biting the migration or importation of &s;laves into any State <HI>thereafter to be establi&s;hed;</HI> but left them to the di&s;cretion of Congre&s;s. Whatever rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned for it, this is certain, that it was the plain meaning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Con|vention, and has been the uniform con&s;truction of the
<PB N="9" REF="035077_0010_1000B587E0190698">Con&s;titution, that the re&s;traint laid on Congre&s;s, by this clau&s;e of the Con&s;titution, applies only to the prohibition of introducing &s;laves.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing this not the true con&s;truction of this clau&s;e of the Con&s;titution, and &s;uppo&s;ing that Congre&s;s is thereby re&s;trained from prohibiting the migration or importation of any aliens whatever; it does not follow, as a ju&s;t con|&s;equence from this, that Congre&s;s can make no law to remove &s;uch aliens. A rule will not be extended beyond the &s;trict words, if this exten&s;ion will promote mischief; e&s;pecially if it endanger the &s;afety of the people, which is the &s;upreme law. I would a&s;k whether this re&s;traint, &s;uppo&s;ing it to re&s;pect aliens generally, mu&s;t not be limited to times of peace; and whether it mu&s;t govern in ex|traordinary times of danger, or mu&s;t then give way to the great rule of &s;elf-defence and general welfare? Let us try this con&s;truction by the rules of rea&s;oning. It is a rule, that, if an argument prove too much, it is un&s;ound.&mdash; Suppo&s;e a body of Frenchmen to arrive at Bo&s;ton, with arms and ammunition, which men may carry for their own defence, and tell the people there, that they are <HI>per|&s;ons</HI> who have migrated, to &s;ettle peaceably in the country. Another body of &s;uch emigrants, with the &s;ame tale in their mouths, arrives at New-York; another, at Philadelphia; another, at Norfolk; and another, at Charle&s;ton. Mu&s;t the State Legi&s;latures of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, of New-York, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Penn&s;ylvania, of Virginia, and of S. Carolina, be con|vened, to order tho&s;e &s;everal bodies of emigrants to depart out of their &s;everal States? Well; the Bo&s;ton emigrant march peaceably into Connecticut; and the South Caro|lina emigrants into North Carolina; and &s;o of the others till they all meet peaceably in Maryland; and then declare that they are come, by order of the Directory, to &s;ettle there, and to prevail on the Pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s, to give the tribute demanded by the Directory. All this they may do; and yet, if Congre&s;s had proceeded to make a law to prevent their landing, or effect their rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l, we &s;hould be told, that Congre&s;s cannot prohibit the migration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> importation of aliens! This &s;eems a &s;trange ab&s;urdity. And yet the ab&s;urdity of this ca&s;e is only altered, it is no

The difficulty of obtaining the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the individual States to any mea&s;ure, however &s;alutary, was
<PB N="11" REF="035077_0012_1000A2D13677A638">&s;ufficiently experienced, as the great evil to be remedied by the Con&s;titution. And a con&s;truction of this Con&s;titu|tion, were it admi&s;&s;ible, will not be favoured, which would leave the general defence of the nation at hazard, on the caprice of a &s;ingle State.</P>
<P>But this law is &s;aid to be contrary to the expre&s;s words of the Con&s;titution, becau&s;e the Con&s;titution declares, that "the trial of all crimes &s;hall be by jury."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;t. Art. <HI>3,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>There is one general ob&s;ervation, which applies to all the objections to this law drawn from the Con&s;titution. It is this; that aliens are not pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties to this in&s;trument, and, therefore, can claim no benefit under it, unle&s;s they are expre&s;sly named. The Con&s;titution is made by "the people of the United States."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;t. Preamble.</NOTE> And for who&s;e benefit? For the benefit of the people of the United States &s;urely. It is the charter of the privileges of the citizens of the United States, to which none but citizens of the United States can thereby claim title. The people of the United States therein limit the power of their government over them&s;elves; but lay no re&s;traint on the power of their go|vernment over aliens. This was not in their view at all. Until aliens become citizens, they are in the power of the ordinary legi&s;lature. The legi&s;lature may receive them, and admit them to become citizens; or may reject them, or remove them, before they become citizens. When they come here, they know, that they come at the di&s;cre|tion of the ordinary legi&s;lature, can claim no privileges as citizens, and have no rea&s;on to complain, if this legi&s;|lature remove them, before they become citizens. The legi&s;lature may refu&s;e to admit them to become citizens, by enacting, that citizen&s;hip &s;hall be acquired only by birth. If the legi&s;lature receive them, retain them, and admit them to become citizens; then, and not before, have they a right to claim the benefit of the Con&s;titution made for citizens. This is clear rea&s;oning. The citizens, who made the Con&s;titution, bargained for them&s;elves, and all who, after them, &s;hould become citizens; but did not bargain for aliens. Would an American citizen, removing into France, claim, as a citizen, the benefit of the French
<PB N="12" REF="035077_0013_1000A29E616948A0">Con&s;titution, again&s;t an act of the legi&s;lature? Would a man received, under the laws of ho&s;pitality, into the hou&s;e of another, tell the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, when he orders him to depart, becau&s;e he &s;u&s;pects him of ill de&s;igns; <HI>"I will not go, you have a lea&s;e of this hou&s;e, you have admit|ted me, I will continue in it under your lea&s;e?"</HI> Aliens are tenants at will, and may be removed at the di&s;cretion of the owner. When they become citizens, they become tenants on fixed terms, and cannot be removed, but ac|cording to tho&s;e terms: they are freeholders, and cannot be deprived of their rights, but on a known forfeiture regularly a&s;certained.</P>
<P>If, therefore, aliens have no right to remain, it is no deprivation of right to order them to depart; and, if it be no deprivation of right, it can be no puni&s;hment; and, if it be no puni&s;hment, this order may be made, without any crime, on the mere &s;u&s;picion or arbitrary will of the legi&s;lature, which, with re&s;pect to them, is &s;overeign, as, with re&s;pect to citizens, the Con&s;titution is &s;overeign. Even a citizen may be deprived of his right to per&s;onal liberty, without any actual crime, on the mere &s;u&s;picion of another, on which a magi&s;trate deems it nece&s;&s;ary to require &s;ecurity of the peace. So may an alien be depri|ved of our indulgence to remain among us, on the mere &s;u&s;picion of the legi&s;lature, that his re&s;idence here is dan|gerous to the public peace. This, being no deprivation of right, but a mere denial of a favour; is no puni&s;hment, but a mere exerci&s;e of the right of &s;elf-defence, which the government of the United States, like that of every other na|tion, may exert at di&s;cretion, without any crime or any trial.</P>
<P>All that is &s;aid of a right to trial by jury is out of the que&s;tion. That refers to an inve&s;tigation of offences pre|vious to puni&s;hment, or a deprivation of a right.&mdash;Here there is no offence, but a &s;u&s;picion, alledged: and, as, even in the ca&s;e of a citizen, he may be impri&s;oned, for the &s;ecurity of an individual; &s;o, in the ca&s;e of an alien, he may be removed, for the &s;ecurity of the nation. And, in this, there is no puni&s;hment, becau&s;e there is no depriva|tion of a right. It is neither an injury nor a puni&s;hment; it is a mea&s;ure of &s;elf-defence, inherent in every owner
<PB N="13" REF="035077_0014_1000A2DA51346758">of a hou&s;e, to turn out of his hou&s;e a &s;tranger, whom he does not choo&s;e to entertain longer.</P>
<P>I will again put the ca&s;e of a &s;tranger admitted, under the laws of ho&s;pitality, into a hou&s;e. The owner thinks he has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that this &s;tranger intends to rob or murder him; or to a&s;&s;i&s;t a gang of thieves, whom he &s;u&s;pects of this intention. He tells the &s;tranger, that he has &s;uch &s;u&s;picion; and de&s;ires him to depart. If the &s;tranger &s;ay, <HI>"Your &s;u&s;picions are wrong, you must prove them, carry me before a magistrate, and let me be tried and convicted, before you take upon you to turn me out of your hou&s;e;"</HI> would this be an an&s;wer? Shall the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, in order to give the &s;tranger the privilege of being tried and convicted, give him and his a&s;&s;ociates an opportunity of accompli&s;hing the wicked purpo&s;es &s;u&s;pect|ed? Suppo&s;e the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e reply, <HI>"I am not well acquainted with your character, but, whatever it be. I have a right to turn you out; go to my &s;teward, and, if you can &s;o explain your&s;elf to him, as that he choo&s;e to permit you to re|main, I agree; but, if he order you to depart, you must go;"</HI> would not this be rea&s;onable? Would this be any puni&s;h|ment of the &s;tranger? No; it is the right of &s;elf-defence. But, as a right to exerci&s;e this power will not authori&s;e the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e wantonly to beat the &s;tranger, or violently to take his money from him; &s;o a right, to re|move an alien from our territory, does not authori&s;e a power to puni&s;h him without a trial by jury.</P>
<P>That aliens, before they can be puni&s;hed, or deprived of any right, for an offence, mu&s;t be tried by a jury, re&s;ults not from the expre&s;s words of the Con&s;titution, which refer not to them, but to citizens. It re&s;ults from this, that our Courts know no other mode of trial, and have no authority to adopt any other.</P>
<P N="2">2. But, if this law &s;hould not be contrary to the expre&s;s words, it is objected, that it is contrary to the principles, of the Con&s;titution, which di&s;tributes the legi&s;lative, judi|cial, and executive powers into three departments; while this law confounds them all in the Executive; and this, it is &s;aid, e&s;tabli&s;hes de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035077_0015_1000B56D32738AE8">
I might re&s;t the an&s;wer to this objection, of a confu|&s;ion and accumulation of powers being a violation of the Con&s;titution, on the ob&s;ervation already made, that this law operates upon none, for who&s;e benefit the Con&s;titution was e&s;tabli&s;hed, or whom the Con&s;titution was intended to affect; and cannot, therefore, be a violation of the Con&s;titution. It operates only on aliens. No citizen has any de&s;poti&s;m to fear from this law. Any citizen may, notwith&s;tanding this law, plot as many "trea&s;ons, &s;trata|gems, and &s;poils," as he plea&s;es; and, if he can e&s;cape the judiciary, may bid the Pre&s;ident defiance.</P>
<P>But, the fact is, there is no confu&s;ion of powers in this law, but &s;uch as convenience or nece&s;&s;ity, con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of the Con&s;titution, introduces into many other laws, to which no man would dream of objecting.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution has not e&s;tabli&s;hed, and no human con&s;titution can e&s;tabli&s;h, a perfect, but only a modified, &s;eparation of powers. What work of Man is perfect?&mdash; It is very common, and it is convenient and nece&s;&s;ary, for the legi&s;lature to pa&s;s a law fixing certain principles, and leaving it to &s;ome other part of the admini&s;tration, the ex|ecutive or judiciary, to a&s;certain the ca&s;es to which &s;uch principles &s;hall be applied, to detail the minute modifica|tions, which no fore&s;ight can &s;ugge&s;t, and experience alone can di&s;clo&s;e; or to pa&s;s a law, which &s;hall operate on a certain contingency, leaving it to &s;ome other part of the admini&s;tration, to declare when this contingency occurs, and the law begins to operate. This le&s;&s;ens not the authority of the legi&s;lature; for &s;uch di&s;cretion cannot be exerci&s;ed by any other part of the admini&s;tration, without the authority of the legi&s;lature; may be re&s;trained, correc|ted, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, whenever the legi&s;lature thinks fit; and is, therefore, altogether under the control of the legi&s;lature. The legi&s;lature, therefore, only determines &s;omething, which it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to determine; and leaves it to &s;ome other part of the admini&s;tration, as ca&s;es &s;hall occur, to determine &s;omething el&s;e re&s;pecting this, which the limited powers of man, the principles of ju&s;t di&s;crimi|nation, and public convenience, render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to determine. Were the legi&s;lature to take upon
<PB N="15" REF="035077_0016_1000B58967B29900">them to modify their laws to every ca&s;e, they mu&s;t be con&s;tantly in &s;e&s;&s;ion; and human capacity would render it impo&s;&s;ible for any one body of men, to di&s;charge their ta&s;k. Therefore, the legi&s;lature wi&s;ely contents it&s;elf with e&s;tab|li&s;hing general rules, and leaves, to &s;ome other part of the admini&s;tration, authority to a&s;certain the modifications and exceptions. Thus the legi&s;lative power determines, that certain actions &s;hall be puni&s;hed; but, as there may be degrees of &s;uch actions, more or le&s;s aggravated, leaves it to the judiciary to a&s;certain the degree of puni&s;hment; and, as, in &s;ome ca&s;es, all puni&s;hment may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, leaves it to the executive to pardon, at his di&s;cretion. All this is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of humanity, ju&s;tice, and public convenience; and it &s;eems ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that the principles of the Con&s;titution are thereby violated.</P>
<P>On &s;uch principles this Alien Act is framed. It e&s;tab|li&s;hes an authority in the Pre&s;ident <HI>"To order all &s;uch aliens as he &s;hall judge dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States, or &s;u&s;pect are concerned in any trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations again&s;t the government thereof, to depart out of the territory of the United States."</HI> But, as a general exertion of this authority may not be nece&s;&s;ary, it provides, <HI>"That if any alien, &s;o ordered to depart, &s;hall prove, to the &s;atisfaction of the Pre&s;ident, that no injury or danger to the United States will ari&s;e; from &s;uffering &s;uch alien to re&s;ide therein; the Pre&s;ident may grant a licence to &s;uch alien to remain within the United States."</HI> What more prudent or proper method could the legi&s;la|ture have adopted? While they were in &s;e&s;&s;ion, and a war was in view; mu&s;t they wait, till there was a declared war, or an actual inva&s;ion, before they e&s;tabli&s;hed the prin|ciple, that aliens might be removed, in a certain manner? When they e&s;tabli&s;hed this principle, were they obliged to e&s;tabli&s;h it without any exception? Or mu&s;t they &s;it or be convened, to decide on every ca&s;e proper as an ex|ception? This would &s;eem, if not ab&s;urd and impractica|ble, at lea&s;t, very inconvenient. Surely the legi&s;lature die better. Congre&s;s has, by this law, declared, that aliens are removeable; ju&s;t as that offenders are puni&s;hable; and has &s;aid, that the Pre&s;ident may choo&s;e, out of all, what aliens &s;hall be removed, ju&s;t as he may choo&s;e out of all what offenders &s;hall be puni&s;hed. The Pre&s;ident may tell
<PB N="16" REF="035077_0017_1000B56FCAD94860">any alien, "<HI>I will permit or licen&s;e you to remain;</HI> as he may tell any offender, <HI>"I will pardon you."</HI> And, in doing this, Congre&s;s has violated no principle of the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">3. Le&s;t this law, when' tried by the words, and by the principles, of the Con&s;titution, &s;hould appear unexcep|tionable, and e&s;cape cen&s;ure; it has been endeavoured to excite a clamour again&s;t it, by drawing a melting picture of the di&s;tre&s;s of aliens, who may thus be ordered to de|part out of the country, at the will of one man.</P>
<P>This is all work of imagination. It cannot be denied, that there is a right in the United States, as in every other nation, to remove aliens; and that there may be ca&s;es, in which the &s;afety of the nation will render it nece&s;&s;ary to exert this right.&mdash;And, I think, it cannot be denied, that, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, the United States were, of any nation ever was, in a condition that required it, as it &s;olemn duty, to exert this right. The rights and &s;afety of individuals mu&s;t never be put into competition with the rights and &s;afety of a nation. Aliens have but an <HI>imper|fect</HI> right, the right of ho&s;pitality and civility, to remain in any nation, to which they are not bound to permanent allegiance. And if the rulers of the nation, in which they have a temporary indulgence to re&s;ide, &s;u&s;pect any danger to the nation, from their re&s;idence, and order them to depart, they have <HI>no right</HI> to remain. The United States were threatened with danger from France, and by the &s;ame means which France has uniformly adopted, to bring danger and de&s;truction on other countries; inte&s;tine divi&s;ions. Aliens having the lea&s;t intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of this country, and owing the lea&s;t duty, only a temporary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uty, to it, were the mo&s;t likely to yield them&s;elves the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eadie&s;t agents of France. And the little re&s;pect, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n this country, is paid to the rights of election, gives them, here, an opportunity of mi&s;chief, which they could, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n no other country, enjoy. Though &s;ome of our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itizenamay be ba&s;e enough to yield them&s;elves as in&s;tru|ments of a foreign power, the Government of the United States has no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uthority to remove them. But it has, like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y other government, in time of danger, authority to

The principles profe&s;&s;ed by the govern|ment of France have excited through the world an en|thu&s;ia&s;m, which nothing, but experience of their de&s;tructive con&s;equences, can correct. There is, in all nations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> number of warm &s;peculative men, combined together to promote the diffu&s;ion and prevalence of this theoretic liberty. Many of the&s;e, either expelled or flying from their own country, re&s;ide in the United States; and are here, it &s;eems, &s;y&s;tematically <HI>united,</HI> not in &s;upport of the principles of our government, but, of an imaginary poli|tical <HI>millennium,</HI> a government which never exi&s;ted, and while man remains as he is, never can exi&s;t; in &s;upport of the fanciful principles, which, in the progre&s;s of its revo|lution to anarchy and de&s;poti&s;m, have brought &s;o much mi&s;ery on France, and on every country where the art and arms of France have prevailed. The&s;e dogmati&s;ts invincible by rea&s;on or experience, united in princples however di&s;per&s;ed in place, as a nation of them&s;elves, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enemies to all governments; and, like the preachers of new, religion, think all other rights and duties ought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> yield to the great duty of e&s;tabli&s;hing their principles To this duty, they will &s;acrifice all other con&s;iderations and, nothing, however cruel or de&s;tructive, that can pro|mote this, will, in their eyes, be a crime. Such men will be dangerous to any country, in which they re&s;ide. In&s;ti|gated by the zeal of pro&s;elyti&s;m, the apparent benevolence in their principles will give them an irre&s;i&s;tible influence on the young and unexperienced.

<P>If there may be ca&s;es of humanity, which may make this exertion, where not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, favour of &s;eve|rity; the que&s;tion is, with whom the power of indulgence nay be be&s;t lodged, &s;o as be&s;t to accompli&s;h the great object, public &s;afety, and mo&s;t to favour humanity.</P>

<P>It was never known, that a numerous and complex body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f men had a more tender con&s;cience, than an uptight individual.

<P>It remains, therefore, only to determine, whether the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">haracter of the Pre&s;ident be &s;uch, as to render him a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roper depo&s;itary of this power of indulgence.
