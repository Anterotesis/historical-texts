<P>PERMIT me to lay at the foot of Your Throne this volume, which is an attempt to tran&s;late from Your Native Language, a work de&s;ervedly admired. I am &s;en|&s;ible it is but a faint repre&s;entation of the glowing beauties of the excellent original; yet I flatter my&s;elf I have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, pre&s;erved the ideas, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which fill and warm the heart with the love of Virtue.

Your Maje&s;ty's Pa|tronage will undoubtedly in&s;ure my &s;ucce&s;s: but I am far from hoping that you, Madam, will give Your Royal Sanc|tion to a performance that has no other merit to plead than the ill-judg'd, tho' affectionate indu&s;try of a fond mother. If I have attempted a ta&s;k for which nature never de&s;igned me, it is ju&s;t that di&s;appointment &s;hould teach me humili|ty and wi&s;dom, and I bow without repining to the &s;troke.</P>
<P>Confined as my &s;ituation is, I &s;hared in the univer&s;al joy vi&s;ible in every countenance on your Maje&s;ty's &s;afe arrival. This general &s;atisfaction was a mo&s;t au&s;picious omen in the beginning of your happy reign.

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I NOW venture on a more &s;ublime &s;ubject than has hither|to employed my pen, from a de&s;ire of knowing whe|ther my abilities will bear a farther trial. This is a curio|&s;ity which ought to influence every man. The public are too apt to di&s;courage a young poet who has &s;ucceeded in one branch of poetry, and are for confining him to that on|ly in which he has been once &s;ucce&s;sful, as his <HI>ne plus ultra;</HI> as if that alone was the very thing in which he could &s;how the whole &s;trength of his genius, when, perhaps, &s;ome ex|ternal circum&s;tance, or a mere accident, rather than any particular impul&s;e, determined his choice.</P>
<P>Though a poet who attempts the &s;ublimer parts of po|etry were not entitled to regard from the public, he would find him&s;elf amply rewarded in the happy execution of his voluntary ta&s;k. To revolve a va&s;t variety of things, to trace the motives of actions to their original &s;ource, to draw characters, and through intricate occurrences gradu|ally to open intere&s;ting events, is attended with a thou|&s;and plea&s;ures Nature is to him an inexhau&s;tible maga|nine, whence true genius collects every material that can ornament or embelli&s;h his favourite object: then is the whole mind in action, and talents are awakened which would very probably have otherwi&s;e lain dormant and unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="011667_0005_0F87CC9835FE6B10">
But it will be &s;aid, At this rate, we &s;hall have nothing to read but epic poems and tragedies. They who are ap|prehen&s;ive of &s;uch a misfortune &s;hould know, that when I &s;ay &s;uch compo&s;itions will give greater and more various plea&s;ures than little pieces to the poet, I mean, it will al&s;o be the &s;ame with the reader. However, few have lei&s;ure or inclination for large performances: mo&s;t men are taken up with occupations of a different nature, many will chu&s;e to pay their addre&s;&s;es to a le&s;s coy mi&s;tre&s;s than the epic mu&s;e; and I dare prophecy, we &s;hall never be without ma&s;|ter-pieces in every branch of poetry. Far be it from me to depreciate the light and &s;portive works of fancy: for though I wi&s;h for more Homers, I yet think Ae&s;op and Anacreon cannot be too much admired.</P>
<P>Some will be a&s;toni&s;hed, and others offended, that I have taken for my &s;ubject a Scripture hi&s;tory. The latter, I will &s;uppo&s;e, are &s;omewhat advanced in years, and have, by be|ing immer&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s, and the arduous ta&s;k of grow|ing rich, been prevented from looking into new books: the&s;e have a zeal for the honor of their religion, and re|tain all the prejudices they imbibed in their youth again&s;t poetry, having drawn their knowledge of that divine art from &s;pecimens, which, a very few excepted, were nei|ther worthy to be known or valued. A poet, in the times of their youth, was e&s;teemed, even by &s;en&s;ible Ger|mans, only as a droll fellow, a kind of bu&s;&s;oon. But to tho&s;e who have peru&s;ed the Bible with &s;o little &s;en&s;e of its beauties, as to make a &s;in of this undertaking, I have no|thing to &s;ay. They mu&s;t be void of ta&s;te; and to rea&s;on with them would be as ridiculous as to carry a lantern be|fore the blind. It is to tho&s;e who are capable of reflec|tion, I would now addre&s;s my&s;elf. I would wi&s;h the&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the works which made poets be con&s;idered in a contemptible light, were wrote in an age when poetry was in its wretched declen&s;ion, and far from its original and genuine dignity. It has always been in the retinue of religion, and is of no &s;mall &s;ervice to it, being the mo&s;t energic method of conveying of virtue and devotion. It affords a noble delight to the under&s;tanding, it improves the heart, and excites to whatever is becoming and prai&s;e-worthy. But to an&s;wer the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, even when it relaxes
<PB N="vii" REF="011667_0006_0F87CC98E9D526F8">and &s;ports, its wit mu&s;t be decent and pure, and have a tendency to create a contempt for ribaldry and profane|ne&s;s. Poetry of the loo&s;e kind I de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t from my very &s;oul.</P>
<P>Under the conduct of prudence, virtue and good manners, poetry may be allowed to take its &s;ubject from the great truths of our holy religion. What can be more proper for the exerci&s;e of genius than the &s;acred hi&s;tory? As Chri&s;|tians we a&s;&s;ent to its truths; as Chri&s;tians we are all equal|ly concerned in its important events. The poet if he has the happy art of illu&s;trating the characters he draws from divine hi&s;tory, with what is probable and plea&s;ing, and placing them in an in&s;tructive view, will have an opportuni|ty of conveying in the cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;triking manner, the &s;alutary influences of religion and piety into the hearts of all cla&s;&s;es of men, and will be read with plea&s;ure by people in every &s;ituation. If this be attempted by a head unequal to the ta&s;k, &s;uch compo&s;itions, I allow, may do more harm than good: but is not this equally the ca&s;e, with all injudicious expo&s;itions?</P>
<P>This liberty with the &s;acred hi&s;tory has been u&s;ed in all nations; and among us, even at the time of the reformation, none took umbrage at the dramatic pieces taken from the &s;criptures: the&s;e were publicly allowed, though their prin|cipal merit was the good intention of their authors, the po|etry being far from elegant.</P>
<P>But a new objector &s;tarts up, and cries, at this rate the bible will become a mere &s;able. I would a&s;k him, if this has been the fate of profane hi&s;tory? Homer and Virgil took the &s;ubject of their poems from ancient hi&s;tory; but who ever thought of adju&s;ting tho&s;e hi&s;tories by their po|ems? or who ever in reading their works, imagined them to be hi&s;torians, or con&s;idered them in any other light than as poets?</P>
<P>There is yet another numerous cla&s;s of people to whom I mu&s;t pay my court: the&s;e are they who are too exce&s;&s;ively polite to reli&s;h heroes who have a &s;en&s;e of piety, who talk of religion, who are &s;erious, and affect neither raillery nor wit. Characters drawn from tho&s;e exhibited in the days of thinking, mu&s;t make a &s;trange appearance to the&s;e &s;ons of fa&s;hion. Such manners! &s;uch conver&s;ation! to them my
<PB N="viii" REF="011667_0007_0F87CC99A91AA0F8">heroes will appear as odd creatures, as tho&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omer did to the French, who were offended that they were not Frenchmen. To the&s;e &s;laves of mode I would whi&s;per it as a &s;ecret, that being my&s;elf young, and, like them fond of applau&s;e, I will, in order to obtain their &s;uffrages, which are of mighty importance to my happine&s;s, give this &s;ub|ject a new dre&s;s. I will introduce an amorous intrigue, for what is an epic poem without a love adventure? Abel &s;hall be a langui&s;hing petit maitre; Cain, a rough captain of the Co&s;&s;acks, and nothing &s;hall come from the lips of Adam, that is not in character from an hoary Frenchman, hack|ney'd in the ways of the world.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE work from which this is attempted, is wrote by Mr. Ge&s;&s;ner, of Zurich, in Swi&s;&s;erland. The rapidity of the &s;ale does honour to the ta&s;te of the Swi&s;s and the Germans, it having pa&s;&s;ed through three editions in one year.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is the death of Abel, which is the mo&s;t re|markable event recorded in &s;acred hi&s;tory, from the fall to the deluge. The poet has had the art to augment our in|tere&s;t in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our primaeval parents, and their im|mediate defendants, by the lively and affecting manner in which he manages the pa&s;&s;ions, and by the graces and truth he throws into his paintings, while he de&s;cribes the &s;imple manners of the fir&s;t inhabitants of the earth.</P>
<P>All our author's works, of which this is the fir&s;t that has been tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, are wrote in a kind of loo&s;e poetry, un&s;hackled by the tagging of rhimes, or counting of &s;yllables. This method of writing &s;eems perfectly &s;uit|ed to the German language, and is of a middle &s;pecies between ver&s;e and pro&s;e: it has the beauties of the fir&s;t, with the ea&s;e of the la&s;t. It is not however peculiar to Mr. Ge&s;&s;ner; for in this manner the great Fenelon wrote his Telemachus, of which the public will &s;oon be favoured with an elegant tran&s;lation by the able hand of Dr. Hawke&s;worth.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="011667_0009_0F87CC9E689CB2B0">
Of this attempt I am not qualified to &s;peak; were I to decry it, I &s;hould be deemed guilty of affectation; if &s;in|cere, I &s;hould be certainly arrogant and rude in offering it to the public, and to prai&s;e it would be pre&s;umption. But I will venture to &s;ay, that I flatter my&s;elf my picture has e&s;caped any glaring deformity, though it may want many of the almo&s;t inimitable graces of the charming original. That painter mu&s;t indeed be a dauber who could make a di&s;agreeable picture, while he attempted to copy a Raphael or a Titian. Such as it is I leave it to the candor of the reader, believing, that notwith&s;tanding the loud cry of univer&s;al depravity, no one will, without ju&s;t cau&s;e, and in mere wantonne&s;s of cruelty, condemn the a&s;&s;iduous ef|forts of a female pen.</P>

<P>HENCEFORTH repo&s;e in &s;ilence, thou &s;oft pipe, no more I render thee vocal, no more I chant the &s;imple manners of the ru&s;tic &s;wain. I would rai&s;e my voice to bolder &s;trains, and in harmonious lays rehear&s;e the adventures of our primaeval parents after their dreadful fall. I would ce|lebrate him, who &s;acrific'd by a brother's fury, his du&s;t fir&s;t mingled with the earth. Come thou noble Enthu&s;ia&s;m that warm'&s;t and fille&s;t the mind of the wrapt poet, who during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilent hours of night contemplates in the thick grove, or at the &s;ide of a clear &s;tream, enlighten'd by the moon's pale lamp; &s;eiz'd by a divine tran&s;port, imagina|tion takes her flight, and with bold wing, traver&s;ing the re|gions of created &s;ub&s;tances, penetrates into the di&s;tant em|pire of po&s;&s;ibilities, di&s;covering with clear view the marvel|ous that captivates, and the beautiful that inchants. Loaded with trea&s;ure, &s;he returns to arrange and con&s;truct her various materials. Taught by rea&s;on to chu&s;e and reject, &s;he, with a wi&s;e oeconomy, admits only what forms
<PB N="12" REF="011667_0011_0F87CCA0D5568A28">harmonious relations. Delightful employment! Laudable con&s;tancy! I honour the bard, who, to excite &s;entiments of virtue in the yielding heart, watches the nocturnal &s;ong of the gra&s;shopper, till the ri&s;ing of the morning &s;tar. Po&s;|terity will crown the urn of a poet who con&s;ecrates his ta|lents to virtue and to innocence: his name &s;hall not be for|got: his reputation &s;hall bloom with unfading verdure, while the trophies of the proud conqueror &s;hall moulder in the du&s;t, and the &s;uperb mau&s;oleum of the tyrant &s;hall &s;tand unknown in the mid&s;t of a de&s;art, where human feet have made no path. Few, 'tis true, who have ventur'd on the&s;e noble &s;ubjects have receiv'd from nature the gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;inging well; but the attempt is laudable: to it I con&s;e|crate my moments of lei&s;ure, and all my &s;olitary walks.</P>
<P>The tranquil hours had ju&s;t given to Aurora the tint of the ro&s;e, and di&s;pell'd the vapours of night that had ho|ver'd over the &s;hadowy earth, while the &s;un beginning to dart his fir&s;t rays behind the black cedars of the mountain, ting'd with radiant purple the half-enlighten'd clouds; when Abel and his beloved Thirza left their leafy couch, and repair'd to a neighbouring bower compo&s;ed of interwoven je&s;&s;amine and ro&s;es. The tendere&s;t love and the pure&s;t virtue &s;hone with milde&s;t beams in the fine blue eyes of Thirza, and gave attractive graces to the carnation of her cheeks: while her fair locks waving in ringlets on her &s;nowy neck, and hanging with a becoming negligence down her back, added to the beauty of her fine and deli|cate form. Thus &s;he walked by the &s;ide of Abel, who&s;e high forehead was &s;haded with ringlets of the pale&s;t brown, reaching no lower than his &s;houlders. An air of thought and reflection was agreeably mix'd with the &s;weet &s;erenity of his looks, and he mov'd with the ea&s;y grace of an an|gel, who charged with the gracious behe&s;ts of the Mo&s;t High, becomes vi&s;ible to the raptur'd &s;aint in an human form; but the veil be a&s;&s;umes is of &s;uch ravi&s;hing beauty, that through it &s;hines the angel. Thirza, with a look of affection, and a tender &s;mile, cry'd, O my love now the birds awake, and begin to chant their morning &s;ong, let me hear the hymn thou ye&s;terday &s;ung in the&s;e &s;miling pa&s;|tures, and let me join al&s;o in the rapturous employment of prai&s;ing the Lord. The melody of thy lips in&s;pires my heart
<PB N="13" REF="011667_0012_0F87CCA134BC3A98">with an holy tran&s;port, and nothing can charm me more than to hear thee utter in proper terms the &s;en&s;ations I feel, but am unable to expre&s;s. Abel tenderly embracing her, reply'd, My lovely Thirza, thy reque&s;t &s;hall be immedi|ately granted. I no &s;ooner read thy wi&s;hes in thine eyes, than with a lover's ha&s;te, I &s;trive to fulfil them. They then &s;eated them&s;elves in the fragrant bower, who&s;e entrance was gilded by the morning &s;un, and Abel thus began:</P>
<P>Retire, O &s;leep, from every eye. Fly ye hovering dreams: rea&s;on again re&s;umes her throne; again &s;he illumines the mind, as the morning &s;un enlightens the fertile earth. We hail thee, re&s;plendent &s;un, who darte&s;t thy beams from behind the cedars; thy friendly rays give light and colour to re-animated nature, and every beauty &s;miles with new|born graces.</P>
<P>Retire, O &s;leep, from every eye. Fly ye hovering dreams to the &s;hades of night. Where are now the &s;hades of night? They have fled to the caves of the rocks; they wait us in the thick grove; we &s;hall find them there, and be refre&s;h'd by their coolne&s;s during the &s;ultry heat of noon. See where the new-born day fir&s;t wakes the eagle; where, on the glittering &s;ummits of the rocks and the &s;hining &s;ides of the mountains, the exhalations a&s;cend and mix with the pure air of the morning, as the &s;moke of burnt offerings ari&s;e from the altar. Thus nature cele|brates the returning light, and pays to nature's God the &s;acrifice of grateful prai&s;e. Prai&s;e him all things that ex|i&s;t; prai&s;e him who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s produc'd and pre&s;erves all. Ye &s;pringing flowers exhale the &s;weets he gave you in his prai&s;e. Ye wing'd inhabitants of the grove, pour forth the warbling of your little throats to his prai&s;e, who gave you voice and melody; while the maje&s;|tic lion pays him honor with the terrors of his mouth, and makes the caverns of the rocks re-echo his prai&s;e. Prai&s;e God, O my &s;oul! prai&s;e God, the Creator and Pre&s;erver. Let the voice of man reach thy throne, O Lord, before that of thy other creatures: in the grey twilight, at the dawn of the morning, while the birds and bea&s;ts yet &s;leep, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay my &s;olitary &s;ong find acceptance, and invite the re|viving creation to prai&s;e Thee, the Creator and Pre&s;erver. How magnificent are thy works, O God! wi&s;dom and
<PB N="14" REF="011667_0013_0F87CCA1D8A02748">goodne&s;s are &s;tamp'd on all. Wherever I turn my eyes, I perceive the traces of Thy bounty; each &s;en&s;e is tran&s;ported and conveys their infinite beauties to my ravi&s;h'd mind. O God! weak and frail as I am, fain would I attempt thy prai&s;e. What induc'd Thee, Maker Omnipotent! for ever happy in Thy&s;elf, to call from nothing this gay creation! what induc'd Thee, Thou Self exi&s;tent, to form man out of the du&s;t, and to give him the breath of life? It was Thine in|finite goodne&s;s. Thou gave&s;t him being that Thou mighte&s;t confer on him happine&s;s. O &s;miling Morn! in thee I &s;ee a lively image of the work of the great Creator, when the &s;un di&s;per&s;es the vapours of the earth, and drives night before his &s;teps, all nature revives with renewed lu&s;tre. The Almighty &s;poke! Silence and night heard his voice: he commanded, and miriads of living creatures emerg'd from the teeming earth, flutter'd in the air with variegated plu|mage, and render'd the a&s;toni&s;h'd woods vocal with the prai&s;es of the beneficent Creator. Earth again hears the voice of her Almighty Maker: the heaving clods ri&s;e in in|numerable &s;hapes and bur&s;t into life and motion. The new form'd hor&s;e bounds o'er the verdant turf, and neighing &s;hakes his main, while the &s;trong lion, impatient to free him&s;elf from the cumbrous earth, attempts his fir&s;t roaring. A hill, teeming with life, appears in motion; it bur&s;ts, it &s;inks, and from it &s;talks the huge unweildy elephant.&mdash; The&s;e are thy works, O thou Omnipotent! Each morn thou calle&s;t thy creatures from &s;leep, the image of non-ex|i&s;tence; they awake &s;urrounded by thy bounties, and join unanimous to chant thy prai&s;e. The time will come when thy prai&s;e &s;hall re&s;ound from every corner of the peopled earth; when thine altars &s;hall blaze on every hill, and man &s;hall celebrate thy wonderous works from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting day.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ang Abel, &s;eated by his beloved Thirza. He ceas'd; yet &s;he, fill'd with a divine tran&s;port, &s;eem'd &s;till to hear. At length, encircling him in her &s;nowy arms, while her eyes beam'd tenderne&s;s, &s;he cried, O my love! the mu&s;ic of thy lips rai&s;es my mind to God. Thy en|dearing care not only protects my feebler body; but un|der thy direction my &s;oul it&s;elf takes her flight: thou art her guide amid&s;t ob&s;curity of doubt and darkne&s;s,
<PB N="15" REF="011667_0014_0F87CCA2A231D478">thy wi&s;dom di&s;&s;ipates the clouds, and turns her a&s;toni&s;h|ment into devout exta&s;y. How often have I, in&s;pir'd by gratitude, render'd thanks to God Mo&s;t High for having created me for thee, and thee for me. O my love! una|nimous in every wi&s;h we were form'd to ble&s;s each other.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, conjugal tenderne&s;s diffus'd inexpre&s;&s;ible graces on every word and every ge&s;ture. Abel remain'd &s;ilent; but his &s;often'd look while he &s;natch'd her to his bo&s;om, and the tear ju&s;t &s;tarting from his gli&s;tening eye, &s;poke unutterable love. Thus happy was man, thus pure his delights. The fruitful earth refre&s;h'd and fitted him for action by her bounties. Contented with nece&s;&s;aries, he a&s;ks of Heaven only Virtue and Health. Luxury and Di&s;|content had not yet fill'd him with in&s;atiable de&s;ires, which, inventive of numberle&s;s wants, bury happine&s;s under a load of &s;plendid mi&s;eries. An union of heart then form'd the nuptial tye. No fear of wa&s;ting penury, or the frown of a tyrannic parent; no low ambition, no want of lands or gold, then kept the &s;oft maid from the fond bo&s;om of the youth &s;he lov'd. The&s;e cares are thy gifts, O Luxury!</P>
<P>Abel and Thirza were &s;till &s;eated, when Adam and Eve enter'd the bower. They had li&s;ten'd with delight to the &s;ong of Abel, and had heard Thirza vent the effu&s;ions of her fondne&s;s. They now tenderly embraced their children, while their hearts expanded with parental affection, and a lively joy glow'd on their cheeks.</P>
<P>Mahala, Cain's &s;pou&s;e, had follow'd the foot&s;teps of her mother, and had been witne&s;s to the happine&s;s of her bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter. Her pure mind was free from envy, bale|ful pa&s;&s;ion! yet dejection &s;at on her countenance, a mild languor appear'd in her eyes, &s;orrow had faded the bloom once &s;een on her now palid cheek. She had heard Thirza expre&s;s her gratitude to Heaven, for having been created for Abel, and he for her. Their mutual tenderne&s;s forc'd tears from her eyes, and &s;ighs from her pain'd bo&s;om, while &s;ad remembrance drew the compari&s;on between the two hu&s;bands. But &s;oon &s;he wip'd away the pourly drops, and with a graceful &s;mile enter'd the bower, where with cordial affection &s;he &s;aluted her brother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Cain pa&s;&s;ing by the fragrant &s;hade, had heard Abel's melodious voice, and had beheld his de|lighted
<PB N="16" REF="011667_0015_0F87CCA398EB41D8">father tenderly embrace him. At this &s;ight Envy fix'd her envenom'd &s;ting in his heart, and he, giving a fu|rious look at the bower, cry'd, What &s;igns of joy are here! What fond care&s;&s;es! I too might &s;ing were my days, like his, &s;pent in idly reclining in the &s;hade, while the flocks were &s;porting or cropping the green herbage: but I am not made for &s;inging. Rugged labour is my inheritance: tho' I turn the glebe; tho' I break the &s;tubborn earth, cur&s;t for my father's &s;in with barrenne&s;s, yet my fatigues meet with no &s;uch fond rewards: did my &s;oft brother but toil, like me, one day beneath the &s;corching &s;un, 'twould &s;poil his mu&s;ic; he'd trill no &s;ongs.&mdash;What, more embraces! how I hate this effeminate dalliance; but if that fair youth be plea&s;ed, no matter what I hate.</P>
<P>Cain then with ha&s;ty &s;tep walk'd on. He had been over|heard, and his di&s;content had fill'd the happy family in the bower with deep concern. Mahala became &s;till more pale, and di&s;&s;olving in tears &s;unk down by the &s;ide of Thirza; while Eve, reclining on her hu&s;band, lamented the obdu|racy of her fir&s;t-born. O, my much lov'd parents, cried Abel, I will follow my unhappy brother. I will embrace him, and &s;ay whatever fraternal love can dictate, to en|gage his affection. I'll try every art of per&s;ua&s;ion to make him forget his anger. I will not leave him till he promi&s;es to love me. I have &s;earch'd into the very bottom of my &s;oul, to know by what means I may regain him, and find a way to his heart. Sometimes I have rekindled his ex|tingui&s;h'd love; but alas! too &s;oon the gloom returns, and &s;ullen &s;adne&s;s damps the &s;acred flame.</P>
<P>With troubl'd look Adam an&s;wer'd, I my&s;elf, my be|loved Abel, will go to your brother. Rea&s;on and paternal love &s;hall unite their force to combat his obduracy; he will not, &s;urely, re&s;i&s;t the authority and tenderne&s;s of an af|flicted father. O Cain, Cain, with what torturing cares do&s;t thou fill my heart! The tumult of tyrannic pa&s;&s;ions has chac'd from thy &s;oul every &s;entiment of benevolence and virtue. O &s;in! fatal &s;in! terrible is the de&s;olation thou &s;preade&s;t in the human brea&s;t. What gloomy pre|&s;ages torture my &s;ad bo&s;om, when I look through fu|turity, and behold thy ravages among my unhappy off|&s;pring. Thus &s;poke the father of mankind. Grief &s;at
<PB N="17" REF="011667_0016_0F87CCA4188E54C8">heavy on his venerable brow. He left the bower, and, with ha&s;ty &s;tep, &s;ought his fir&s;t born. Cain beheld him coming, and, cea&s;ing from his labour, thus began: What means this &s;ternne&s;s in my father's look? It was with no &s;uch air of &s;everity thou cam'&s;t to embrace my brother.&mdash; Why do thine eyes reproach me?</P>
<P>Thou would'&s;t not, my &s;on, have read reproach in mine eyes, return'd Adam, wert thou not con&s;cious thou de&s;erv'&s;t it. Yes, Cain, thou de&s;erve&s;t reproach, and thy offended father is come to thee in all the bitterne&s;s of grief.</P>
<P>Without any love, interrupted Cain; that &s;en&s;ation is re&s;erv'd for Abel.</P>
<P>With love al&s;o, re&s;um'd Adam, Heaven is my witne&s;s. I love thee with a father's fondne&s;s. The&s;e tears, the&s;e in|quietudes and anxious cares that agitate me, and no le&s;s her who brought thee forth with pain, have their &s;ource in the mo&s;t affectionate love. 'Tis this tender love and concern for thy happine&s;s, that ca&s;ts a gloom over our days. 'Tis this love that cau&s;es the &s;ilence of the night to be inter|rupted by our &s;ighs and lamentations. O Cain, Cain! did&s;t thou love us, it would be thy mo&s;t earne&s;t care to dry up our tears, and to di&s;pel that cloud of grief which darkens our days and fills them with horror. Ah! if thou &s;till retaine&s;t in thy brea&s;t any re&s;pect for the Omni&s;cient Creator, to whom the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of thine heart are open: if the lea&s;t &s;park of filial love to us, thy parents, &s;till remains in thine obdurate &s;oul, I conjure thee by that re&s;pect, and that love, to re&s;tore us to our lo&s;t peace.&mdash;Re&s;tore, O my &s;on, our extingui&s;h'd joy. Nouri&s;h no longer again&s;t thy brother, who loves thee with a &s;incere affection, this ruth|le&s;s hatred. He longs to embrace thee. Gladly would he clear thy mind from the tares of di&s;content with which it is over-run. O Cain! thou wert my fir&s;t-born, the be|ginning of my &s;trength. When thine infant eyes open'd to the light, I beheld thee with all the father in my heart. Wherefore then is thy &s;oul di&s;quieted? why does Envy dwell in thy bo&s;om, becau&s;e I rejoice too in thy brother? His refin'd and exalted piety drew from us tears of joy, and we in the &s;weet tran&s;port care&s;s'd him. The angels who &s;urround us, applaud every good action; the Almighty him&s;elf looks down from heaven's high arch, and regards
<PB N="18" REF="011667_0017_0F87CCA7D3B29270">with complacency the grateful offerings of a thankful heart. Would&s;t thou change the invariable nature of beauty and goodne&s;s? This is not in our power, and if it were, Cain, how mu&s;t we be deprav'd before we could wi&s;h to with&s;tand the noble joy, the tender, the exqui&s;ite feelings, that high rais'd devotion and exalted virtue create in the enraptur'd &s;oul. Darkne&s;s, &s;torms, and the thunders of heaven call forth no gentle &s;mile on the human countenance; as little do the agitation of boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions cau&s;e joy to &s;pring up in the human heart.</P>
<P>Cain &s;ternly an&s;wer'd: Is reproach then all that I am to hear from a father's lips? If my face does not always wear a plea&s;ing &s;mile; if tears of tenderne&s;s do not follow each other down my cheek, am I for this to be branded with dete&s;table vices? Born with more firmne&s;s, bold enterprizes and &s;e|vere toils have ever been my choice. Nature has &s;tamp'd on my forehead a manly gravity. I cannot weep or &s;mile at every trifle. Does the towering eagle coo like the timerous dove?</P>
<P>Adam, with maje&s;tic gravity, return'd: Thou deceive&s;t thy&s;elf; thou harboure&s;t in thy bo&s;om horrid &s;entiments, that will rankle in thine heart, and render thee wretched if they are not &s;tifled. O Cain! it is not manly gravity that is &s;tamp'd on thy brow; it is envy, &s;orrow, and gloomy di&s;content. The&s;e are &s;een in thine eyes; the di&s;turbance of thy mind is vi&s;ible in thy whole deportment. Thine inward dejection, O my &s;on! has &s;pread a den&s;e cloud over all thy pro&s;pects. Hence ari&s;e thy continual mur|murs, thy peevi&s;hne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion during the labours of the day. Hence thy un&s;ocial aver&s;ion to us: hence the black melancholy to which thou art a prey. Tell, oh tell thine affectionate father, what will give thee ea&s;e. It is his ar|dent wi&s;h that thy days may pa&s;s &s;erene as the vernal morn. What cau&s;e ha&s;t thou, O Cain! to be di&s;quieted? are not all the &s;prings of happine&s;s open to thee? Indulgent nature offers to thee all her beauties. The good, the u&s;eful, the agreeable, are they not thine as well as ours? Why then do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thou leave the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven unta&s;ted, and com|plaine&s;t of wretchedne&s;s? Is it becau&s;e thou art di&s;&s;atisfy'd with the portion of happine&s;s the divine bounty has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on fallen man? Is not every ble&s;&s;ing the
<PB N="19" REF="011667_0018_0F87CCA7E203EA90">unde&s;erved gift of infinite goodne&s;s? Do&s;t thou envy the lot of angels? Know that the angels were &s;u&s;ceptible of di&s;content, and by a&s;piring to become gods, forfeited hea|ven. Would&s;t thou arraign the di&s;pen&s;ations of the Mo&s;t High towards his &s;inful creatures? While the whole crea|tion in univer&s;al concert prai&s;e the Creator, &s;hall guilty man, a worm, &s;prung from the mud, dare to lift up the head, and carp at him who&s;e infinite wi&s;dom regulates the wide expan&s;e of heaven; to whom all futurity is pre&s;ent; and who, by His unerring providence, can cau&s;e evil to be productive of good. Be chearful, O my &s;on; ca&s;t far from thee this &s;adne&s;s and di&s;content: let it no longer di&s;|turb thy thoughts; no longer throw a frightful gloom over the natural &s;erenity of thy countenance. Open thy heart to every &s;ocial affection, and look with a grateful complacency on all innocent plea&s;ures which nature di&s;plays before thee.</P>
<P>What need of all the&s;e exhortations? cried Cain. Do I not know, that was my heart at ea&s;e, every thing around me would give me delight? but can I &s;ilence the &s;torm, or bid the impetuous torrent flow in a placid &s;tream? I am born of woman, and from my nativity &s;entenc'd to mi|&s;ery. On my unhappy head the Almighty has pour'd forth the cup of malediction. It is not for me nature di&s;|plays her beauties, nor do the &s;treams of bli&s;s, of which you take &s;uch plentiful draughts, flow for me.</P>
<P>Alas! my &s;on, &s;aid Adam, with a voice render'd almo&s;t inarticulate by his &s;trong emotions and his tears; 'tis but too true, that the Divine malediction was pronounc'd on all born of woman, but why, Oh why &s;hould&s;t thou believe that God has pour'd on thee, our fir&s;t-born, more of his wrath, than on us the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors? No, this is not, this cannot be the ca&s;e: &s;overeign goodne&s;s contradicts it. No, my dear &s;on, thou wert not born for mi&s;ery; the benefi|cent Creator never call'd any of his creatures into being to render them unhappy. Man may, indeed, by his own folly make him&s;elf wretched. If he &s;uffers his rea&s;on to yield to im|petuous pa&s;&s;ions, ignorant of true felicity, he may render his life a burthen, and convert what is naturally good and &s;a|lutary into a de&s;tructive poi&s;on. Thou can&s;t not &s;ilence the &s;torm, nor &s;top the rapidity of the torrent; but thou cur&s;t di&s;pel the clouds of di&s;content that ob&s;cure thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea|&s;on,
<PB N="20" REF="011667_0019_0F87CAB51B6C9588">and re&s;tore to thy &s;oul its original light. Thou can&s;t force into &s;ubjection every impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, every irre|gular de&s;ire. Gain, O my &s;on, this noble victory over thy&s;elf, and it will refine thy &s;entiments: thy whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oul will be illumin'd: darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s will vani&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the mi&s;t of the dawn before the &s;olar ray. There was a time, my dear &s;on, when I have &s;een even thee &s;hed tears: when from the gratulations of con&s;cience, joy has &s;pread it&s;elf through all thy powers; delightful fruit of virtuous actions! I refer it to thy&s;elf, Cain, wert thou not then happy? was not thy &s;oul like the clear azure of the hea|vens, unclouded, un&s;potted? Recover that beam of the Deity, rea&s;on: let her clear light direct thy &s;teps, and virtue, her in&s;eparable companion, will re&s;tore joy and permanent felicity to thy purify'd heart. Li&s;ten, O Cain! and comply with the advice of thy father. The fir&s;t injunction that rea&s;on lays on thee is, to embrace thy brother. With what joy will he receive thy endearments! with what tenderne&s;s will he return them!</P>
<P>Father, replied Cain, when at the heat of noon I re&s;t from my labour, I will embrace him. I cannot now leave the field. I promi&s;e I will obey thee and embrace my bro|ther: but&mdash;while I breathe, my firm &s;oul will never be di&s;&s;olv'd to that effeminate weakne&s;s, that &s;o endears him to you, and makes your eyes run over with tran&s;port. To a &s;oftne&s;s like this we all owe the cur&s;e denounc'd again&s;t us, when in paradi&s;e you weakly &s;uffer'd your&s;elf to be overcome by a woman's tears.&mdash;But what do I &s;ay? dare I reproach my father? No, my venerable parent, I reve|rence thee, and am &s;ilent. Thus &s;pake Cain, and return'd to his labour.</P>
<P>Adam remain'd motionle&s;s with his hands and eyes rais'd to heaven. At length in a tone of deep di&s;tre&s;s, he cry'd, O Cain! Cain I have de&s;erv'd the&s;e cutting reproaches: but &s;hould&s;t thou not have &s;par'd thy father? Should&s;t thou not have forborne this cruel charge; which, like a clap of thunder, &s;hakes my tortur'd &s;oul? Ah me! thus will my late&s;t po&s;terity, when immers'd in &s;in, they feel the pangs in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">parable from guilt, ri&s;e up again&s;t my du&s;t, and cur&s;e the fir&s;t &s;inner. Having thus &s;poke, Adam with pen|&s;ive eyes fix'd on the earth, &s;lowly withdrew. The groans
<PB N="21" REF="011667_0020_0F87CAB5DB5C7C70">that bur&s;t from the agitated bo&s;om of the afflicted father, now &s;truck even this obdurate &s;on with remor&s;e, and he cry'd, gazing after him, What a wretch am I! How could I reproach &s;o good, &s;o tender a parent? How have I loaded him with grief! I &s;till hear his groans.&mdash;I &s;ee him lift up his &s;upplicating hands to heaven.&mdash;Perhaps, vile as I am, he prays even for me; for me who have torn his heart with keen di&s;tre&s;s! Oh that I too could pray! but I am a mon&s;ter,&mdash;hell is in my bo&s;om, and like a ravaging whirlwind, I de&s;troy the peace of all around me. Return, O Rea&s;on return! Return, O Virtue! chace from my troubled &s;oul the&s;e wild and darkening pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Still&mdash; &s;till he prays. O how his emotions reproach me!&mdash;His cla&s;p'd hands are again rais'd in agony.&mdash;He &s;eems &s;pent.&mdash; I will at his feet implore his pardon.&mdash;O my ra&s;h tongue &mdash;my rebellious heart!</P>
<P>Cain then ran towards Adam, who was leaning again&s;t a tree, with his weeping eyes fix'd on the ground. He threw him&s;elf on the earth, and cry'd, forgive me&mdash;for|give me, O my father! I de&s;erve thou &s;hould&s;t turn from me with abhorrence. I abhor my&s;elf; but while I am thus humbled before thee in the du&s;t&mdash;while I thus gra&s;p thy knees, de&s;pi&s;e not my repentance&mdash;de&s;pi&s;e not my tears. My hard|en'd heart re&s;i&s;ted thine exhortations with a &s;ullen pride: but O my injur'd father! thy di&s;tre&s;s and thy groans have melted my obdurate &s;oul. A beam from heaven has enlighten'd my benighted mind. With unfeign'd &s;orrow and deep contri|tion, I &s;ee my folly&mdash;I &s;ee my guilt&mdash;I know that I am unworthy of thy love. Yet, O my dear and venerable pa|rent! reject not the&s;e penitential tears&mdash;reject not the &s;incere &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of my heart. O my father! I implore pardon of God, of thee, and of my brother.</P>
<P>Ri&s;e, my &s;on, ri&s;e, cry'd Adam, affectionately embrac|ing him, and rai&s;ing him to his bo&s;om; the Mo&s;t High, who dwelleth in the heavens, beholds with complacency the&s;e tears of repentance. Embrace me, my &s;on, and receive thy joyful father's forgivene&s;s and cordial embrace. Ble&s;t time! happy hour! in which my &s;on, my fir&s;t-born, re|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ores our tranquility. O my child! joy, exce&s;s of joy has weaken'd all my powers. Support me my &s;on, and let us

<P>Adam leaning on Cain, walk'd towards the pa&s;tures. Abel with his mother and &s;i&s;ters met them in the grove: they had followed Adam at a di&s;tance; they had &s;een his emotions, and with delight had beheld the repentance and tears of Cain. Abel, the moment he &s;aw his brother, flew to him with open arms: he cla&s;p'd them around him with a &s;trenuous gra&s;p, unable for &s;ome time to give vent, but from his eyes, to the &s;weet effu&s;ions of his heart. At length he cried, O my brother &mdash; my dear brother! thou then lov'&s;t me!&mdash;lov'&s;t me with fondne&s;s! let me hear thy lips pronounce that thou &s;till love&s;t me, and my happine&s;s will be complete. Yes, my brother, an&s;wer'd Cain, while he pre&s;s'd him with a warm embrace, I do, indeed, &s;incerely love thee. May I hope thou wilt for|give my having &s;o long embitter'd thy days by my unkind|ne&s;s, and the fury of my boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions. I too, my brother, was unhappy; but rea&s;on, like the rapid fla&s;h of heaven, broke through the gloom, and has di&s;pers'd the baleful tempe&s;t. Never, Abel, never may'&s;t thou remem|ber my former darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The delighted Abel, with encreas'd rapture reply'd, Never my dear Cain. Be the pa&s;t utterly forgotten: who would dwell on the di&s;tre&s;sful illu&s;ions of a morning dream, when they might, like me, awake to real happine&s;s, &s;ur|rounded by multiply'd delights. O my dear brother! words have not power to expre&s;s my tran&s;ports&mdash;to ex|pre&s;s the &s;weet joy with which my &s;oul is fill'd, while I thus pre&s;s thee, my brother! my friend! to my throbbing heart.</P>
<P>Eve, who had with tender delight beheld this moving &s;cene, &s;prang to her &s;ons, and throwing her maternal arms around them both, while delicious tears of joyful &s;ympathy ran down h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> cheeks, cry'd, O my &s;ons! my dearly be|loved children, never did I, &s;ince I have borne the tender name of mother, feel &s;uch exqui&s;ite, &s;uch rapturous &s;en|&s;ations. The griefs, which like the weight of a cumberous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nountain oppre&s;s'd my &s;oul, are now remov'd.

<P>The angel of the Lord, on who&s;e countenance &s;hone be|nignity and &s;oft compa&s;&s;ion, was commi&s;&s;ion'd to drive us out of paradi&s;e. He &s;ooth'd us with gentle words, cheer'd us with promi&s;es, and bid us hope and put our tru&s;t in the clemency of our All-merciful creator: but the &s;word, in his hand flam'd terrible.

<P>We had a&s;cended an high hill, and now going down the de|clivity, every &s;tep dimini&s;h'd our view of Eden; my heart was rent with agony, and my grief depriv'd me of motion.

<PB N="27" REF="011667_0026_0F87CABD5F783E70">hill, where we found a grove of poplars, which extended to the foot of a rock. Eve then giving her hu&s;band a look of affection, was &s;ilent, and Adam thus continued:</P>
<P>We advanc'd, my children, thro' the grove, and found in the rock a cavity that form'd a grotto. See, deare&s;t Eve, &s;aid I, &s;ee the convenience offer'd us by nature: this grotto will afford us &s;helter, and this pure &s;pring that murmuring flows from its &s;ide, will &s;lake our thir&s;t. We'll here prepare our lodging: but, my deare&s;t wi&s;e, before we &s;leep I mu&s;t &s;ecure the entrance, to keep us from being &s;ur|priz'd by nocturnal enemies: What enemies? return'd Eve, with emotion: What enemies have we to fear? Ha&s;t thou not remark'd, my love, &s;aid I, that the cur&s;e of our &s;in has fallen on the whole creation: the bands of friend&s;hip are broken between the animals, and the weak are now become the prey of the &s;trong. I have &s;een a young lion pur&s;ue with fatal rage a frighted roe. I have beheld a war in the air among the birds. We can no longer claim a right to command the animals: the &s;pot|ted leopard, the brindled lion and fierce tyger no more fawn on us, nor play their wanton gambols in our &s;ight; but ca&s;t again&s;t us frightful roarings, while their blazing eyes threaten de&s;truction.

<P>Eve, with timid looks, keeping me in her &s;ight, went to gather flowers and leaves to form our bed, and fruit for our repa&s;t. In the mean time I &s;ecur'd the entrance of the grotto with entwin'd brambles. My &s;pou&s;e, ha&s;ten'd by fear, quickly perform'd her ta&s;k, and returning, re&s;ted her&s;elf before me on the tender gra&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;oon after enter'd the grotto, and &s;eating our&s;elves on our bed of intermingled leaves and flowers, began our frugal meal; &s;ea&s;on'd, however, with mutual endearments, and grateful conver&s;e; when a gloomy cloud &s;uddenly ob|&s;cur'd the declining &s;un.

Eve &s;truck with terror, threw her&s;elf, &s;carce breathing, into my arms, and clinging to my brea&s;t, cry'd, He comes!&mdash;he comes! in flames he comes to bring the threaten'd death!&mdash;How dread|ful!&mdash;For my &s;in he comes to give death to us and to all nature!&mdash;O Adam!&mdash;O my love!&mdash;Here her voice fail'd, and &s;he remain'd trembling and pale on my bo&s;om.

<P>We then pro&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed our&s;elves at the entrance of the grotto, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e countenances and trembling lips, of|fer'd up our adorations, expecting when our awful Judge would from the clouds, pronounce by his thunders, Die, ye ungrateful! and let the earth that bore you be di&s;&s;olv'd by the fire of my indignation!</P>
<P>The clouds now pour'd forth their torrents: livid flames no longer fla&s;h'd from the heavens, and the thunder roll'd at a di&s;tance. I rais'd my head from the ground, &s;aying, The Almighty, my dear Eve hath pa&s;s'd by. He hath not de&s;troy'd the earth: we are yet permitted to live. He hath remember'd his promi&s;es.

<P>We aro&s;e and were comforted.

Silence reign'd over the moi&s;t fields, the herbage and flowers, &s;till glittering with the drops of heaven, glow'd with more than u&s;ual beauty.

<P><PB N="29" REF="011667_0028_0F87CABF04FBDD18">
Thus pa&s;s'd the fir&s;t day after our leaving Paradi&s;e. The ruddy evening gave place to the grey twilight, and &s;oon the earth was only enlighten'd by the moon's feeble rays. We now for the fir&s;t time were chill'd by the cold of the night, though a few hours before we had almo&s;t faintd un|der the ardent rays of the &s;corching &s;un at noon.

<P>Sleep, the relief of the weary, at length came; but it was unaccompany'd with that &s;oft ea&s;e, that &s;weet delight which ble&s;t our &s;lumbers while innocent: our imagination then pre&s;ented none but &s;miling and agreeable images. In|quietude, fear and remor&s;e, did not then keep us waking the tedious hours of darkne&s;s, nor mingle in our dreams with fanta&s;tic phantoms. The heavens were however calm, and our re&s;t was undi&s;turb'd: but Oh! how different from that delicious night when I led thee, my &s;pou&s;e, for the fir&s;t time, to the nuptial bower! The flowers and odoriferous &s;hrubs charm'd with new &s;weetne&s;s. Never was the war|bling of the nightingale &s;o harmonious; never did the pale moon &s;hine with &s;uch radiance: But why do I dwell on images that awaken my grief, now hu&s;h'd to &s;ilence?</P>
<P>We &s;lept till the morning &s;un had exhal'd the limpid dew. When we awoke we found our&s;elves refre&s;h'd and fitted for labour, and enjoy'd with delight and gratitude the harmo|ny of the birds, who were celebrating with their &s;weete&s;t notes the renewed light: their number yet was but &s;mall: for there were then no other animals on earth but tho&s;e who, in&s;tructed by divine in&s;tinct, had after the fall, fled from Paradi&s;e, that the garden of the Lord might not be defil'd by death.</P>
<P>We offer'd up our adorations at the entrance of the grot|to; after which, I &s;aid to Eve, We will, my love, go farther and view this immen&s;e country: our All-merciful God has given us liberty of choice. We may fix our abode where the earth is mo&s;t fertile; where Nature is mo&s;t profu&s;e of her beauties. See&s;t thou, Eve, that river, which, like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uge &s;erpent, winds in bright &s;lopes through the meadows.
<PB N="30" REF="011667_0029_0F87CAC44C428CC0">The hill on its bank, &s;eems at this di&s;tance like a garden full of trees, and its top is cover'd with verdure.

<P>We were going on when we &s;aw, ju&s;t above our heads, a bird fly with feeble wing: its feathers were rough and di&s;order'd: it ca&s;t forth plaintive cries, and, having fluttered a little in the air, &s;unk down without &s;trength among the bu&s;hes.

<P>We now advanc'd to the eminence. Its gentle a&s;cent was almo&s;t cover'd with bu&s;hes and fertile &s;hrubs. On the &s;ummit, in the mid&s;t of fruit-trees, grew a lofty cedar, who&s;e thick branches form'd an exten&s;ive &s;hade, which was render'd more cool and delightful by a limpid brook, that ran in various windings among the flowers. This &s;pot af|forded a pro&s;pect &s;o immen&s;e, that the &s;ight was only bounded by the du&s;ky air; the &s;ky forming a concave around us, that appear'd, wherever we turn'd, to touch the di&s;tant mountains. Here, &s;aid I, my deare&s;t love, we will fix our abode. This &s;pot is a faint &s;hadow of Paradi&s;e, who&s;e bli&s;sful bowers we mu&s;t never more behold. Receive us, maje&s;tic cedar, under thy &s;hade. Ye trees of various ta&s;te and hue, refre&s;h and &s;u&s;tain us with your delicious fruits: never &s;hall we gather the &s;weet produce without gratitude: It &s;hall be the reward of our attentive care and laborious cultivation. O God Omnipotent, who reigne&s;t in Heaven! look with a propitious eye on this our dwelling. Lend an ear of compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;upplications, receive with favour the prai&s;es and thank&s;givings which we, Thy frail offending creatures, &s;hall never cea&s;e to &s;end up towards thy cele&s;&s;ial throne, through the &s;preading branches of the&s;e trees. Here, my deare&s;t wife, we &s;hall obtain, by the &s;weat of our brows, our &s;upport. Under the&s;e &s;hades, thou &s;halt bring forth with pain. From hence, will our offspring &s;pread them&s;elves over the wide earth. Here too, death &s;hall one day vi&s;it us, and we &s;hall be confounded with our original du&s;t. O Lord God our Maker! &s;hower down Thy ble&s;&s;ings on the profane abode of us &s;inners. While I

<P>I now began to con&s;truct our habitation under the &s;hade of the &s;preading cedar. I fix'd in the earth a circle of &s;trong &s;takes, and interwove them with &s;lexible twigs. While I was thus employ'd, Eve was conveying the &s;tream among the flowers; gathering ripe fruits; &s;upporting, with &s;mall &s;ticks, the bending &s;talks of the variegated &s;hrubs, and pruning their luxuriant branches. Then it was that we be|gan to eat our bread by the &s;weat of our brows.</P>
<P>I went to the river to fetch reeds to cover our cottage: there I &s;aw five ewes, white as the &s;outhern clouds, and with them a young ram, feeding by the &s;ide of the water. I approach'd them without noi&s;e, fearing they would fly me, like the tyger and the lion; who, before our fatal tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, us'd to play with the kid or the lamb at our &s;eet. But, in&s;tead of endeavouring to e&s;cape me, they &s;uf|fer'd me to &s;troke their fleeces, and I drove them before me, with a reed to our hill; where I intended they &s;hould, for the future, feed. Eve was bu&s;ied in erecting a bower, and did not immediately, on my return, ob&s;erve my little &s;tock; but they &s;oon di&s;cover'd them&s;elves by their bleat|ing. She &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and dropp'd the boughs from her hand thro' fear: but &s;oon recovering, &s;he cry'd, with joy in her countenance, O Adam! they are gentle and fond as in Paradi&s;e. Welcome, pretty animals, ye &s;hall live with us. All you want is here. Ye need not &s;tray; for here are flowery pa&s;tures, fragrant herbage, and a clear &s;pring. Your innocent &s;porting will give us delight, while we attend our trees and flowers. Yes, harmle&s;s creatures, &s;he continu'd, patting their woolly backs, ye &s;hall be my flock, and I will be your indulgent mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Our little dwelling was now completed, and we were enjoying the cool breezes at its entrance, and &s;ilently &s;ur|veying the di&s;tant country, when Eve &s;aid, my deare&s;t love, how beautifully is the pro&s;pect before us variegated! How fertile, how full of ble&s;&s;ings is this earth, which we thought &s;o barren! Let us to the fruits and flowers, which
<PB N="33" REF="011667_0032_0F87CAC7E7172038">the hill already yields, add tho&s;e that grow on its borders, and our abode will have a faint re&s;emblance of Eden's delightful &s;hades. Ah! &s;he added with a &s;igh, it will then bear but the &s;ame proportion of likene&s;s to Paradi&s;e, as that does to the bli&s;sful &s;eats of the angels, which the heavenly me&s;&s;engers, who, in our happy days of innocence, conde&s;cended to vi&s;it us, de&s;crib'd in &s;uch glowing colours.

I have &s;een too, that not only animals are the prey of death; he &s;tretches his wide domain, he tyrannizes over the whole earth, and makes rude havock in the world of vegetation. O Adam! what fruits have I beheld drop from their branches, &s;poilt, and full of black rottenne&s;s! What flowers wither on their &s;talks! The trees are di&s;rob'd of their verdure by the di&s;poiler, Death. I have ob&s;erv'd too, that young leaves &s;upply the place of tho&s;e that are fallen, and that the &s;eeds of dead flowers ca&s;t into the earth, produce new ones. We, Adam, mu&s;t thus, one day, wither and die, and our children &s;hall &s;ucce&s;&s;ively grow up and flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>She ceas'd &s;peaking, and I, deeply affected by her words, made an&s;wer. Dear Eve, were our lo&s;s only the gay verdure, the fruits and flowers of Paradi&s;e, it would &s;carce de&s;erve a &s;igh; but, alas! we are expell'd from the &s;acred &s;pot which our Maker ble&s;s'd by his immediate pre&s;ence. There, veiling his in&s;upportable radiance, he walk'd among the groves, while all nature celebrated the approach of the Deity in reverential &s;ilence. Tho' form'd of the du&s;t, my pro&s;trations were accepted. The Almighty conde&s;cended to hear his creature, and vouch&s;af'd to an&s;wer, with be|nignity, a frail worm. Alas! we have, by our di&s;obedi|ence, lo&s;t this privilege; guilty as we are, we can no more
<PB N="34" REF="011667_0033_0F87CAC89C03DC18">hope to conver&s;e with infinite purity. This, this calls for our lamentations and our tears. Will the God of Heaven vi&s;it a land under his cur&s;e? Will the Mo&s;t Holy dwell among &s;inners? He looks down from the &s;eats of bli&s;s: He regards with an eye of compa&s;&s;ion our penitence and tears, and his bounties exceed every hope our wretch|edne&s;s could form. Even the bright &s;pirits of Heaven are his Me&s;&s;engers; they execute his orders on this dark globe; but, alas! our polluted eyes are now unworthy to behold them: They perform the ta&s;k a&s;&s;ign'd, without deigning to become vi&s;ible to &s;inful man, and then &s;oar, with ha&s;ty wing, from this &s;eat of corruption, now fit on|ly to be the re&s;idence of beings under the cur&s;e of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>Thus were we holding conver&s;e, and ca&s;ting our melan|choly eyes on the country before us, when a re&s;plendent cloud de&s;cending, glided towards us, and re&s;ted on our hill; from it &s;tept a radiant form, wearing on his face a maje&s;tic &s;mile. We ha&s;tily aro&s;e; we bow'd our heads, and the cele&s;tial me&s;&s;enger thus &s;poke: He who&s;e throne is in the highe&s;t Heaven, has heard your complaints. Go, &s;aid he, and inform tho&s;e children of a&s;&s;liction, that my pre|&s;ence is not circum&s;cribed by the circuit of Heaven, it extends to all the works of my hands.</P>
<P>Whence has the &s;un its invigorating heat? who teaches the &s;tars to run their cour&s;es? Why does the earth bring forth its fruits, and day and night regularly &s;ucceed each other? Who pre&s;erves the various animals? In Me they live, move, and have their being. What keeps thee, Adam, from &s;inking into corruption? I am near thee: I &s;u&s;tain thee by my power. I guard thee by my provi|dence; and know the &s;ecret breathings of thy &s;oul, and all the purpo&s;es of thine heart.</P>
<P>The luminous &s;phere, that encompa&s;s'd the angel, reach'd even to me. Fill'd with devout exta&s;y, I lifted up to him my dazzl'd eyes. How great beyond conception, &s;aid I, are the favours of the Lord! He beholds our wretchedne&s;s with compa&s;&s;ion: He &s;ends his angels to give us comfort. O effulgent &s;pirit! I &s;tand con&s;ounded and aba&s;h'd before thee. How &s;hall I, &s;inful man that I am, dare to &s;peak to thee, the unoffending me&s;&s;enger of Hea|ven,

That the Mo&s;t High, a being perfect in purity, &s;hould more intimately communi|cate Him&s;elf to a worm defil'd with &s;in, I do not pre&s;ume to expect. What I dread is, that when man &s;hall be mul|tiply'd on the earth, he will be e&s;trang'd from God his Maker. I have fallen, my children may al&s;o fall&mdash; fall into more horrid depths, and thus being more and more debas'd, their wretchedne&s;s will encrea&s;e. The time will come, when I &s;hall be no longer with them, to inform them, and give, in my own per&s;on, evident proofs of the loving-kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of the Lord. 'Tis true, the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect will declare His beneficence: but if God continues to hide His face from man, will not the voice of Nature be too weak to &s;trike his mind? Will not the idea of the Deity be totally lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t, confounded in darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity? This thought gives my fore|boding heart exqui&s;ite angui&s;h.

<P>Father of men, reply'd the angel, with a&s;pect benign, He in whom and by whom all things exi&s;t, will not for|&s;ake thine offspring. Often will they, by their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly affront the Maje&s;ty of Heaven. Often will their &s;ins cry aloud for vengeance. The Al|mighty will gra&s;p his thunder, and di&s;play the terrors of His judgments. The guilty &s;hall tremble in the du&s;t: the &s;inners &s;hall cry out in agony, Dreadful is the wrath of God, who can &s;tand before it? But more often will He make him&s;elf known in kindne&s;s: He will delight to &s;hew favour to the repenting children of men. Mercy and com|pa&s;&s;ion dwell always with him, Judgment is his &s;trange work. He will rai&s;e from among thy po&s;terity men who&s;e minds he will enlighten. They, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spirit of God, &s;hall call their brethren to repentance.

Often will he &s;peak to the &s;ons of men by his angels: frequently in prodigies; and there will be &s;ome righteous per&s;ons to whom he will, with infinite goodne&s;s, more intimately ma|nife&s;t Him&s;elf: to them he will &s;peak face to face; till at length &s;hall be u&s;her'd in the great mi&s;tery of the &s;alvation of mankind, when the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</P>
<P>The angel was &s;ilent, and I, encouraged by the conde|&s;cen&s;ion and &s;weetne&s;s of his look, reply'd, O cele&s;tial friend! if thou wilt yet allow me, frail as I am, to call thee &s;o; and why &s;hould I doubt it? &s;ince thou can&s;t not hate him whom the Eternal does not hate&mdash;him for whom the Divine clemency manife&s;ts it&s;elf with &s;uch &s;plendor as &s;trikes the heavenly ho&s;t with admiration, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es the power of words to expre&s;s, when the adoring &s;oul, humbled in the du&s;t, attempts to pour forth its gratitude: Tell me lucid &s;pirit, if it be permitted thee to draw from the ob&s;curity, with which they are &s;urrounded, tho&s;e augu&s;t my&s;teries; tell me what is the import of the promi&s;e, the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, and what is meant by the cur&s;e denounc'd again&s;t man, thou &s;halt die.

Never did God ma|nife&s;t him&s;elf with &s;uch lu&s;tre and magnificence, only in that memorable in&s;tant when his creative voice called the &s;tars from non-exi&s;tence, and His Almighty fiat went on creating through the immen&s;ity of &s;pace. The adoring angels were in eager expectation of what was to follow this unu&s;ual pomp, when the maje&s;tic voice of God &s;ounded through the arch of heaven, uttering the&s;e words of benigni|ty and grace; I will not withdraw my favour from the &s;inner. To my infinite mercy the earth &s;hall bear witne&s;s. Of the woman &s;hall be born an Avenger, who &s;hall brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent. Hell &s;hall not rejoice in this victo|ry. Death &s;hall lo&s;e its prey. Ye Heavens &s;hew forth your gladne&s;s! Thus &s;pake the Eternal. The blaze of his glory would have been too &s;trong for even the eyes of arch|angels, had not a thin cloud temper'd its in&s;upportable radiance. The ble&s;t inhabitants of Heaven celebrated with joy this great my&s;tery, and attun'd their golden harps to the prai&s;es of the Father of Spirits, who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works. How God will pardon the &s;inner without offending his ju&s;tice, &s;urpa&s;&s;es conprehen&s;ion; but it is enough, Eternal Truth hath &s;aid it. We know, and thou may&s;t al&s;o re&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd, that Death, having lo&s;t his power, can only di&s;engage the &s;oul from its bonds. The body, that ve&s;ture of earth, &s;hall return to the du&s;t, of which it was form'd, while the immortal &s;pirit, refin'd from all defilement, &s;hall be rais'd to Heaven, to partake there with angels, archangels, and all the cele&s;tial ho&s;t, never ending &s;elicity.</P>
<P>Hear, Adam, the order of thy God, I will be gracious to thee and to thy &s;eed. There &s;hall be a &s;ign between me and thee, as the &s;eal of this great promi&s;e: thou &s;halt build an altar on this hill, and offer on it a young lamb. I will, on my part, &s;end down fire to con&s;ume the victim. This &s;acrifice thou &s;halt renew every year, and the flame &s;hall annually de&s;cend to burn thine offering.</P>
<P>I have now told thee, fir&s;t of men, continu'd the angel, all that the Mo&s;t High thinks proper to reveal of his in|&s;crutable decrees. I am al&s;o allow'd to &s;hew thee, that ye are not &s;o &s;olitary on this globe as ye imagine. Cur&s;t as this earth is, ye are &s;till &s;urrounded by pure &s;pirits, who are
<PB N="38" REF="011667_0037_0F87CAD023316E10">commi&s;&s;ion'd to be your guard and defence, and order'd to pre&s;ide with watchful care, over the works of nature. The angel then touching our eyelids, we beheld beauties that I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe. No words could give ideas that would do ju&s;tice to the bright magnificence of the &s;cene. All the country round us was peopled with the children of Heaven, more beautiful than Eve when &s;he fir&s;t came from the hands of her Creator, and with &s;oft reluctance, and mode&s;t grace, receiv'd her welcome in my arms.</P>
<P>Some were employ'd in collecting the light mi&s;ts that i&s;&s;u'd from the moi&s;t earth: they bore them upwards on their expanded wings, and converted them into mild dews, and fertilizing &s;howers. Others lay reclin'd, near purling brooks, watching le&s;t their &s;ources &s;hould fail, and the plants they water'd be depriv'd of their humid aliment. Many were di&s;pers'd through the open country, who pre|&s;ided over the growth of fruits, and &s;pread on the opening flowers azure, green and red, with every vivid hue, and, by breathing on them, impregnated them with fragrance. Some peopled the groves, employ'd in various offices: from the glittering wings of the&s;e were wafted gentle breezes, which, pa&s;&s;ing through the foilage of the trees, hover'd over the flowers, and &s;kimm'd along the &s;urface of the brooks and lakes. Some among the&s;e cele&s;tial la|bourers, having perform'd the ta&s;k a&s;&s;ign'd them, were &s;itting in the &s;hade, joining in harmonious concert: the melody of their voices accompany'd the &s;ounding &s;trings of their golden harps, and they &s;ang, to the prai&s;e of the Mo&s;t High, hymns, not to be heard by mortal ears. Not a few were walking on our hill, and among our bow|ers: in their gentle looks I beheld commi&s;eration of our di&s;|tre&s;s: but now our eyes again became unable to behold the heavenly effulgence, and the rapturous &s;cene di&s;appear'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e, which you have ju&s;t beheld, &s;aid the angel, are &s;pirits commi&s;&s;ion'd to watch over the productions of the earth: they are the appointed a&s;&s;i&s;tants of Nature, and help to promote and complete her various works, according to the invariable and immutable laws of the great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e. The Creator has given exi&s;tence to innumerable orders of beings. Even this earth, tho' under the cur&s;e of the Mo&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="011667_0038_0F87CAD0E2C57188">High, is full of beauty, and the admiring angels behold on this globe, objects too &s;ublime for mortal &s;ight. The delightful employment of &s;ome of the&s;e children of Hea|ven, is to watch over thy &s;afety, O Adam! to avert from thee unfore&s;een misfortune. They accompany thee in all thy ways: they a&s;&s;i&s;t thee in thy labours, and often turn even thy di&s;appointments to thy advantage; bringing from an apparent evil a real good. They, with plea&s;ure, behold thy dome&s;tic happine&s;s. They are witne&s;&s;es of thy mo&s;t &s;ecret actions. A &s;mile of benevolence &s;hews their joy when man, their charge, acts right: the frown of di&s;dain and &s;orrow &s;its on their brow, when he forgets him&s;elf and his happine&s;s. The&s;e, in future ages, the Lord will employ to di&s;tribute plenty through the countries he will delight to ble&s;s, or to carry famine and de&s;olation among rebellious nations, when it &s;hall plea&s;e him to recal them by his cha&s;|ti&s;ements.</P>
<P>The angel ceas'd &s;peaking. He ca&s;t on us a look of mild conde&s;cen&s;ion, and was lo&s;t, to our eyes, in a &s;hining cloud. We pro&s;trated our&s;elves on the earth, with devout exta&s;y, and humbly offer'd up our thank&s;givings to our Beneficent and All-merciful Creator.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;et up the altar, as the Lord had com|manded, on the &s;ummit of the hill; Eve employ'd her&s;elf in con&s;tructing around it a little paradi&s;e. She brought from the neighbouring plain the mo&s;t beautiful and odori|ferous flowers: the&s;e &s;he planted on all &s;ides of the altar, and, with cheerful labour, water'd them, each morning and evening, from the clear &s;tream that flow'd near our dwelling. O tutelar angels! &s;aid &s;he, in the mid&s;t of her labour, complete the work of my hands; for without your aid, in vain &s;hall I plant, in vain &s;hall I water! May your kind cares, bright &s;pirits, give the&s;e flowers more life, more beauty, more fragrance, than they had in their na|tive &s;oil, for to the Lord of All this inclo&s;ure is con&s;ecrated! I planted a &s;pacious circle of trees around the holy altar, and their thick branches &s;pread an awful &s;hade, that di&s;|pos'd the mind to devout contemplation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e occupations we pa&s;s'd the &s;ummer, expos'd each lay to the &s;corching &s;un. Autumn arriv'd, and repaid our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bour with its various fruits. It drew near its clo&s;e; the
<PB N="40" REF="011667_0039_0F87CAD199862E00">loud bla&s;ts of the north began to be heard, and the tops of the mountains were cover'd with an hoar fro&s;t. Not then knowing, that the weak earth, which was exhau&s;ted by the profu&s;e liberality of &s;ummer and autumn, wanted to recover her &s;trength by the Re&s;t of Winter, we &s;aw, with grief, the &s;adden'd face of Nature. In Eden we kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w no change of &s;ea&s;ons: mild &s;pring, gay &s;ummer, and plen|teous Autumn, charm'd there together. As the winter advanc'd, the face of nature wore encrea&s;ing gloom: the flowers wither'd on their &s;talks, and, if any yet &s;urviv'd around the altar, they &s;eem'd, with drooping head, to mourn their approaching fall. The late&s;t fruits fell from the trees, and the &s;aple&s;s branches ca&s;t their leaves. The clouds pour'd down torrents of rain, and the highe&s;t peaks of the mountains were cover'd with &s;now. We beheld this &s;cene of de&s;olation with fear and anxiety. Should this, my deare&s;t Eve, &s;aid I, be only the fir&s;t effects of the cur&s;e pronounc'd again&s;t this earth, and God continues to puni&s;h, &s;he will be &s;tripp'd of the &s;mall remains of utility and beau|ty, which her degradation has left her: &s;mall were they in compari&s;on of the delights of Paradi&s;e; yet they were &s;ufficient to &s;often our toil, and afforded us many of the conveniences and ble&s;&s;ings of life; but if the Divine male|diction continues to &s;pread de&s;truction on this earth, how gloomy will be our days? What will become of our pro|mis'd offspring? Thus we mourn'd our melancholy &s;itua|tion; but, encourag'd by the promi&s;es of our God, we plac'd in him an humble confidence. We endeavour'd to con&s;ole each other, and to drive from our minds every thought of murmuring or di&s;content, and thankfully ador'd the Lord, in the mid&s;t of the dreary horrors, by which we were &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>We laid up for our winter &s;upport tho&s;e fruits that had e&s;cap'd corruption and rottenne&s;s, and, that they might be &s;till pre&s;erv'd, we dry'd them by fire. I cover'd our cot|tage anew, and made a clo&s;er fence around, to keep ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the cold and the rain.

<P>Sad and &s;low pa&s;s'd our days, while the clouded &s;ky pour'd forth rain, and the bleak winds chill'd us with cold. But at length the genial &s;un re-animated the earth, and brighten'd the heavens, while gentle winds chac'd the moi&s;t fogs from the &s;ummits of the mountains. Reviving Na|ture &s;mil'd at the return of youth: the fields were again cloath'd in cheerful green: innumerable flowers deck'd the pa&s;tures, and &s;eem'd to vie with the &s;un in lu&s;tre: the trees again began to &s;hoot out their buds, and all nature was full of new born joy. Thus, crown'd with leaves and flowers, came amiable Spring, that delightful morning of the year.</P>
<P>The trees with which I had &s;urrounded the altar were pre-eminent in beauty. Eve &s;aw, with inexpre&s;&s;ible rapture, the flowers &s;he had planted on the holy &s;pot, recover'd their bloom. In vain, my children, &s;hould I attempt to give you an idea of our joyful exta&s;y. We ran to the con&s;ecrated circle, fill'd with devout gratitude. The &s;un illumin'd the &s;acred &s;pot with his pure&s;t radiance. Every creature &s;eem'd to join in our prai&s;es of the Creator. The flowers exhal'd their &s;weete&s;t odours; the trees extended the &s;hade of their blo&s;&s;oming branches over the holy altar; the wing'd in&s;ects, that inhabited the tender gra&s;s, chirp'd forth their joy: while the birds, on the &s;preading boughs of the trees, enliven'd our devotion by their mellifluous harmony. We ca&s;t our&s;elves on our knees: tears of gratitude and joy bur&s;t from our eyes, fell on the gra&s;&s;y turf, and min|gled with the dew of the morning. Our fervid prayer a&s;cended towards the Lord of Nature, towards the God of Grace and Goodne&s;s, who had mercifully turn'd, even the effects of his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, to our advantage.</P>
<P>I now began to cultivate a little field upon the hill. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t into the fercile earth &s;ome grains which I had pre&s;erv'd from the produce of autumn.

<PB N="42" REF="011667_0041_0F87CAD6C07AA670">and I was di&s;appointed when I had high hopes that I had found the art of contracting my labours. I &s;hould &s;ome|times have been without re&s;ource, had not the gentle &s;pi|rits, who watch'd over my happine&s;s, conde&s;cended to enlighten me.</P>
<P>One morning as I ca&s;t my eyes towards the altar, I be|held, with awe, the flame of the Lord burning over it. The ri&s;ing &s;un gilded with his beams the a&s;cending &s;moke. Enraptur'd, I call'd to my beloved; See, deare&s;t Eve, I cry'd; &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of the promi&s;e. Behold, the &s;acred flame is come down on our altar. Let us go to it immediately. Every labour mu&s;t now cea&s;e. I will, as the Almighty hath commanded, kill a young lamb. Ha&s;te, my love, and chu&s;e the fine&s;t flowers to &s;trew the &s;acrifice. I took the be&s;t of my flock: but, my children, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to give you a de&s;cription of what I felt, when I went to deprive the innocent animal of life. A trembling &s;eiz'd my hand; I was &s;carce able to hold the &s;truggling victim, and never could I have brought my&s;elf to give it death, had not my re&s;olution been animated by the expre&s;s com|mand of the author of Life. The very remembrance of its endeavours to e&s;cape gives me pain. When I beheld its quivering limbs in the la&s;t moments of its exi&s;tence, an univer&s;al tremor &s;hook my own; and when it lay before me, without &s;en&s;e or motion, dreadful forebodings invaded my troubled &s;oul. In obedience to the divine command, I laid the bleeding lamb on the altar, and Eve &s;catter'd on it odoriferous flowers. We then pro&s;trated our&s;elves on the earth before it, with reverence and fear, and offer'd up our humble prai&s;es to the God of Truth, who had thus &s;olemnly verify'd his promi&s;es. An awful &s;ilence reign'd around us, as if Nature celebrated the pre&s;ence of her God. In this perfect calm our ravi&s;h'd ears were charm'd with the min&s;trel&s;y of Heaven. The angels that hover'd over us, join'd in our devout prai&s;es. The flames &s;oon con|&s;um'd the &s;acrifice, and on its extinction, which was &s;ud|den, an aromatic odour diffus'd it&s;elf through the far extended country.</P>
<P>A little after this &s;olemn day of reconciliation, I was going, at &s;un-&s;et, to re&s;t my&s;elf, after the fatigue of the day, near my beloved. I a&s;cended the hill. I &s;ought for her in vain,
<PB N="43" REF="011667_0042_0F87CAD764C9E478">in our cottage. I look'd for her, with anxiety in the &s;hady bower. At length I found her, pale, and without &s;trength, at the &s;ide of the &s;pring, and thee, Cain, my fir&s;t-born, lying on her bo&s;om. The pains of child-birth had &s;eiz'd her, while &s;he was employ'd in her ordinary labours, near the brook. She was bedewing thine infant face with tears of joy. At &s;ight of me &s;he cry'd, with a &s;mile, I &s;alute thee, father of men. The Lord hath a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s: I have brought forth this &s;on, to whom I have given the name of Cain. O thou dear fir&s;t-born! &s;aid &s;he, the Lord hath favourably regarded the hour of thy birth; may all thy days be con&s;ecrated to his prai&s;e! how weak, how helple&s;s is he that is born of woman? May'&s;t thou, dear infant, ri&s;e as a young flower in the &s;pring! May thy life be a &s;weet pre&s;ume offer'd up to hea|ven! I then took thee, my fir&s;t-born, in my arms. I &s;alute thee, &s;aid I to Eve, I &s;alute thee, mother of men. The Lord be prai&s;ed, who hath a&s;&s;i&s;ted thee in thy di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;a|lute thee, Cain, fir&s;t of human beings who gave pain to thy mother: fir&s;t of human race, who entered into life to leave it by death. O God, continued I, look down from thy throne, and regard, with compa&s;&s;ion, this thy feeble creature. Shed thy gracious benediction on the morning of his life. It &s;hall be my delightful ta&s;k to in&s;truct his young mind: I will &s;hew him the miracles of thy grace: I will teach him the wonders of thy love. Morning and evening his infant lips &s;hall be taught to &s;ound forth thy prai&s;e. O deare&s;t Eve, mother of men, I cry'd, in the tran&s;port of my heart, a race, without number, &s;hall flou|ri&s;h around thee. This myrtle was, like thee, &s;olitary, till the tender &s;uccours &s;prang from the maternal root.

<P>Thus, O Cain! did I utter the &s;weet effu&s;&s;ions of my heart. I ki&s;s'd thine infant lips with the mo&s;t tender joy. Thy mother then took thee in her enfeebled arms, when, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to ri&s;e, I led her to our dwelling.</P>
<P>Strength and vigour &s;oon began to animate thy little members. Laughter and gaiety &s;parkled in thine eyes, and mirth play'd upon thy cheeks. Already wert thou able to run, with thy tender feet, on the &s;oft gra&s;s, and among the flowers: already thy little lips began to li&s;p forth thine infant thoughts, when Eve brought into the world Mahala, thy &s;pou&s;e. Full of joy thou &s;kipp'd about the new-born, ki&s;s'd her, and cover'd her with flowers. Eve, at length, brought forth thee, O Abel! and after|wards Thirza, thy companion. With inexpre&s;&s;ible joy we beheld your innocent plea&s;ures. Our delight encreas'd as we &s;aw your young minds unfold them&s;elves, and arrive, by little and little, at maturity. We employ'd our mo&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pttive care to cultivate your mental powers, to direct your thoughts to worthy objects, that your lives might diffu&s;e the agreeable odour of virtue.

<P>I have now, my beloved children, the happine&s;s to &s;ee you arrived at your full growth, as the tender plants are by the hand of time transform'd into lofty and wide &s;pread|ing trees.

<P>Adam here fini&s;h'd his recital. A nymph united by the &s;oft bands of hymen to her favourite &s;wain, wanders with him in the early dawn. They hear the &s;weet notes of the nightingale, while all is &s;ilence around. Her voice &s;eems the echo of their own fond thoughts, and through their &s;ouls is diffus'd a tender tran&s;port. The bird cea&s;es her melody; but they &s;till li&s;ten, with the ear of expectation turn'd towards the branches from whence &s;he chanted her nocturnal &s;ong. Thus, though our general father ceas'd to &s;peak, his children remain'd fix'd in mute attention. The different &s;cenes he had repre&s;ented gave them various emotions: &s;ometimes the gu&s;hing tear dropp'd from their eyes, at others a lively joy &s;pread it&s;elf over their features. They all return'd their thanks to the father of men; Cain rendered his as well as the others; but he alone had neither &s;mil'd nor wept.</P>

<P>Anamelech, one of the inferior &s;pirits of Hell, had ob|&s;erv'd the behaviour and di&s;cour&s;e of Cain. He had &s;een, with malicious joy, the &s;igns of envy and wrath in his ruf|fled features. This malignant daemon, though of the low|e&s;t order among the rebel angels, did not yield in pride and ambition to Satan, the archapo&s;tate. Often while in Hell, he retir'd from his companions, whom he de&s;pis'd: Often he remain'd in &s;olitude among the infected rivers of &s;ulphur that flow'd through the burning land, or &s;tray'd alone on the enormous rocks, who&s;e &s;ummits were hid in &s;tormy clouds. There in &s;ecret he repin'd at his ignoble indolence, while the blue flames, reflected from the tops of the mountains, ca&s;t an ob&s;ure and horrid light on the path made by his wandering feet. But when Hell, with tumul|tuous roar, celebrated the prai&s;es and triumphs of her king, who, on his return from the terre&s;trial globe, elate with pride, recounted how he had &s;educ'd our general ance&s;tors, and boa&s;ted his having forc'd the Eternal to pronounce again&s;t them the decree of death and wretchedne&s;s, then the black venom of Envy &s;well'd the ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ourous brea&s;t of Ana|melech.

No: I feel my&s;elf equally capable of noble daring: I will a&s;toni&s;h my compeers. I will force Hell's fierce monarch to pronounce my name with re&s;pect. Actuated by the pro&s;|pect of ri&s;ing to di&s;tingu&s;h'd greatne&s;s among the infernals, he meditated baleful projects, and nouri&s;hed in &s;olitude in|veterate hatred to the human race.

The mangled limbs of infants, trampled under the feet of their &s;avage murderers, was to him a plea&s;ing &s;ight; and he felt an helli&s;h tran&s;port, when he beheld their fond parents pro&s;trate on the earth, in all the bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h, tearing their hair, and beating their brea&s;ts, di&s;tain'd with the blood of their guiltle&s;s offspring.</P>

The &s;harpe&s;t pains this night have &s;eiz'd your father, and he now &s;truggles with &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e that &s;eems to penetrate even to his bones. He endeavours to conceal his angui&s;h.

But O my children! the mo&s;t poignant grief has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, and my tortur'd heart refu&s;es all con&s;olation. When he repo&s;es in mo&s;t tranquillity, he &s;eems lo&s;t in reflection: an in&s;tant after he groans with agony: a cold &s;weat covers his face, and the tears he had re&s;train'd, bur&s;t, in a torrent, from his eyes.

<P>Fill'd with &s;orrow, they &s;urrounded the bed of the &s;ick. Adam then lay tranquil.

My intrails are torn with angui&s;h: but, prais'd be the Lord, who regulates all by unerring wi&s;dom! perhaps he has ordain'd the&s;e pains to unloo&s;e the bands that unite my &s;oul to this trail body. If it is now to return to the du&s;t of which it is form'd, I &s;ubmit. I adore the di&s;pen&s;ations of my Maker, and wait, with re|&s;ignation and love, the fatal hour. I will prai&s;e Thee, the Sovereign of Life and Death, till this union is di&s;&s;olv'd: my &s;oul &s;hall then, deliver'd from its ve&s;ture of earth, offer Thee more elevated prai&s;e.

<P>He then ca&s;t his languid eyes on our general mother, who was weeping at his &s;ide. And thou Eve, &s;aid he, whom I love as my&s;elf, and you, my dear children, add not to my griefs by your &s;orrow and tears. How cruelly does your affliction di&s;tre&s;s me! Cea&s;e, my beloved, cea&s;e the&s;e &s;ighs, and the&s;e lamentations. Perhaps the Lord may remove the terrors of his hand, and death may yet be at a di&s;tance. Perhaps I may again, even on earth, ta&s;te joy and glad|ne&s;s. I wait the good plea&s;ure of my God, and re&s;ign my|&s;elf to his will. Do you al&s;o, my dear children, and you, my tender &s;pou&s;e, acquie&s;ce with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and devout gratitude, in the Divine appointments. Accu&s;tom your|&s;elves before-hand to reflect with holy re&s;ignation, on the in&s;tant when it &s;hall plea&s;e the Almighty to &s;trip off this garment of earth, and take me from you.

<P>When his agonies were abated, he regarded all about him with &s;ilent attention; but his looks were more particularly fix'd on Eve, who &s;eem'd overwhelm'd by her deep di&s;|tre&s;s: her &s;orrows augmented tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, and, to con&s;ole her, he again re&s;um'd his di&s;cour&s;e: Alas! &s;aid he, the death experienc'd by the fir&s;t &s;inner, will doubtle&s;s have &s;omething frightful in it, to tho&s;e who &s;hall behold it: but it will be more terrible &s;till to him who &s;hall be the victim.

<P>Adam was &s;ilent, his children &s;toop'd to ki&s;s his trembling hand. Yes, my father, they cry'd, we will pro&s;trate our|&s;elves before the Lord.

Great God how terrible! &mdash;Abandon me not, O my Maker! for&s;ake not, in the la&s;t agony, an expiring &s;inner.

<P>Such was the prayer of Abel. He was &s;till pro&s;trate on the earth, from which he was rous'd by a di&s;tant &s;ound. Sweet odours were wafted around, and before him &s;tood a guardian angel, re&s;plendent in beauty. On his &s;erene brow he wore a coronet of ro&s;es, and his &s;mile was gracious as the opening day. He &s;aid, with a voice mild as the breath of the zephyrs, The Lord hath lent a gracious ear, O Abel! to the voice of thy &s;upplications. He hath granted thee the de&s;ires of thine heart. He hath commanded me to a&s;&s;ume a body, and to bring thee con&s;olation and &s;uc|cour. The Eternal, who ince&s;&s;antly watches over his crea|tures; who regards with the eye of beneficence the crawl|ing in&s;ect, as well as the archangel array'd in glory, hath order'd this earth to produce, in its bo&s;om, &s;alutary reme|dies for the di&s;ea&s;es of its inhabitants, who&s;e bodies, by the

<P>The angel, having given him the &s;alutary herbs, di&s;ap|pear'd.

I am but &s;inful du&s;t and a&s;hes. I would prai&s;e, Thee, O my God! but thy bounties exceed all prai&s;e. The triumphant archangel cannot &s;ufficiently exalt thy name, yet thou ha&s;t deign'd to accept the &s;upplications of a worm.</P>
<P>His lively joy lent him wings. He ran to his cottage, and with eager impatience prepar'd the odoriferous dilution. This perform'd, he flew to his father. Eve was &s;till bath'd in tears, and her daughters &s;at pen&s;ive by her &s;ide. They &s;aw with &s;urprize his eagerne&s;s, the joy which &s;parkled in his eyes, and the &s;mile which &s;at on his lips. Dry up your tears, my beloved, &s;aid he, as he enter'd. Weep no more, O my mother! the Lord hath heard our prayers, he hath &s;ent us &s;uccour. An angel hath appear'd to me in the pa&s;|tures.

They heard his words with a&s;toni&s;hment, and render'd thanks to the Lord, with gratitude and humble confidence. The &s;ick drank the healing draught, and &s;oon experienc'd its &s;alutary effects. Adam now rais'd him&s;elf on his bed, and with ardent pie|ty offer'd up his adorations; then taking the hand of Abel, he pre&s;s'd it to his cheek, and wetted it with tears of joy, &s;aying, O my &s;on! ble&s;&s;ed be thou! thou, by whom God hath &s;ent me &s;uccour: thou, who&s;e virtue plea&s;eth the Lord: thou, who&s;e prayer he accepts, and hath vouch&s;af'd to an&s;wer.

<P>Cain left his father's dwelling; but it was to retire into the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of a thick grove, where, oppre&s;s'd with melancholy, he repeated after Adam, Peace and tranquilli|ty&mdash;an uninterrupted repo&s;e&mdash;How can I enjoy this tran|quillity?&mdash;Where &s;hall I find this repo&s;e?

<P>The father of men thus prais'd the Lord, while the whole creation appear'd attentive to his prayer, and &s;eem'd to fe|licitate his return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o life. The glorious orb of the day darted on him in its la&s;t rays. The young zephyrs wafted on their ambro&s;ial wings the aromatic perfumes of the groves and gardens, as if charged by the flowers to exhale their &s;weets to him. The feather'd inhabitants of the woods &s;a|luted him with their &s;ofte&s;t notes, actuated by a lively joy.</P>
<P>Cain and Abel came under the &s;hade, while Adam was yet on his knees. They &s;aw with delight, their father re&s;tor'd to health. The prayer ended, Adam, aro&s;e from the earth, he embrac'd, and receiv'd the embraces of his tran&s;ported children: he ki&s;s'd, with fond affection, the moi&s;ten'd cheek of our general mother; after which, he, Eve and their daughters, return'd to their dwelling. Abel then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Cain, &s;aid, Let us al&s;o, my dear brother, render thanks to God Mo&s;t High, who ha&s;t re|&s;tor'd to our tears our affectionate father. I will, by the light of the moon, which is now ri&s;ing, offer on mine al|tar a young lamb: Wilt not thou al&s;o, on thine altar, make an offering.</P>
<P>Cain, giving him a gloomy and angry look, &s;aid, Yes, I will pre&s;ent an offering to the Lord of what my barren

Abel, with graceful &s;weetne&s;s, reply'd, O my brother! the Lord our God counts as nothing the lamb which burns before him, neither doth he regard the fruits of the field which the fire con&s;umes. 'Tis the ardent piety that flames in the heart of the wor&s;hipper, that gives the offering all its value.</P>
<P>Cain return'd, The fire of Heaven, will perhaps con&s;ume thy victim; for by thee the Lord &s;ent health to our father &mdash;I am di&s;dain'd. However, I will make my offering. I am, as well as thee, penetrated with gratitude. Our father, who is re&s;tor'd to our wi&s;hes, is equally dear to me, as to thee. Let the Lord do with me, mi&s;erable worm! ac|cording to His good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Abel tenderly threw him&s;elf on the neck of Cain, &s;aying, Ah my brother, my dear brother! do&s;t thou make the Lord's having &s;ent by my hand, relief to our father, a new &s;ubject of di&s;content? I was charg'd with this commi&s;&s;ion for us all. All pray'd to the Lord: the prayers of all were an&s;wer'd. Bani&s;h from thy bo&s;om, my dear brother!&mdash; let me intreat thee, to bani&s;h for ever, the&s;e gloomy ideas. The Lord, who &s;ees into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our &s;ouls, can di&s;cover there unju&s;t thoughts, and &s;ecret murmurs. Love me, as I love thee. Offer thine offering; but &s;uffer it not to be defiled by any impure di&s;po&s;itions. May the Lord, O my brother! favourably accept thy prai&s;es, and graci|ou&s;ly &s;hed his ble&s;&s;ings on thee.</P>
<P>Cain an&s;wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not; but walk'd toward his field, and Abel, looking after him with a pitying eye, repair'd to his pa&s;tures. Each advanc'd to his altar. Abel &s;lew a young lamb; laid it on his altar; &s;catter'd on it odoriferous herbs and &s;lowers, and put fire to the offering, then, warm'd with &s;ervent piety, pro&s;trated him&s;elf before it, and with humble gratitude prais'd the Lord. The flame ro&s;e on high through the gloom of night, and enlighten'd the fields and pa&s;tures. The Lord forbad the winds to blow, be|cau&s;e the &s;acrifice was acceptable.</P>
<P>Cain laid on his altar the fruits of the field; put fire to the offering, and al&s;o pro&s;trated him&s;elf before it. In|&s;tantly a terrific &s;ound was heard among the bu&s;hes. A fu|rious whirlwind advanc'd towards the altar; di&s;pers'd the offering of Cain, and cover'd him with flame and &s;moke.

<P>Cain, &s;eiz'd with horror, quitted the place of &s;acrifice, a tempe&s;tuous wind driving after him the infected &s;moke of the offering. Appall'd with terror, he wander'd through the darkne&s;s.

Did the Creator bani&s;h from his pre&s;ence all the offspring of Adam? or did the cur&s;e affect only the children of the fir&s;t-born? too &s;everely it is felt by us, the &s;ons of Cain: our portion is labour and indigence.

<P>Cain was now carry'd, on Imagination's &s;portive wing, to a plain enamell'd with a variety of flowers, water'd by limpid brooks, which, meandring, ran with &s;oft murmurs near aromatic bowers, under the &s;hade of tu&s;ted groves. The banks were decorated with lofty trees, and the clear water, reflecting the vivid colours of their &s;everal fruits, form'd a new land&s;cape.

<P>The&s;e were the imprecations of Cain. When Abel, pale as the &s;culptur'd marble, ventur'd to approach him with flow and un&s;teady &s;tep.

At the &s;ame in&s;tant, with an arm &s;trengthen'd by rage, he &s;wung a ma&s;&s;y club, and &s;mote the head of his brother. The innocent victim of his fury fell at his feet.

<P>She now left her dwelling, and walk'd among the open|ing flowers, who&s;e fir&s;t &s;weets were diffus'd by the morning breeze. My heart &s;till throbs, &s;aid &s;he, &s;till anxiety is lodg'd in my brea&s;t. What mean the&s;e un&s;ual fears! an interior trembling &s;eems to &s;hake my very &s;oul.

Yea, with you I lo&s;e part of the load of woe that Cain's di&s;con|tent heaps on my wretched head. To him unhappy! all the beauties of nature are only &s;ources of melancholy, and he continually regrets the labour which his fertile fields &s;o abundantly repay. But, my deare&s;t Thirza, above all I lament his unkind and cau&s;ele&s;s di&s;like to our gentle bro|ther. Mahala now melted into tears.

Our re&s;ource is in the hand of Heaven.

<P>Mahala, &s;till in tears, an&s;wer'd, This, this is al&s;o the &s;ubject of my ince&s;&s;ant prayer.

My unhappy hu&s;band, this very day, left our dwelling before the dawn. His looks were terrible. Never did I &s;ee &s;o dark a gloom on his coun|tenance.

Froze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with horror, I heard him as he went forth cur&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his birth. This, my &s;i&s;ter, was his &s;alute to &s;o fine a morning. 'Tis true, I have not lo&s;t all hope; for &s;ometimes (and thou thy&s;elf ha&s;t ob&s;erved it) his virtue breaks through the gloom, and his mind is open to the &s;oft &s;en&s;ations of &s;ocial love. Then he acknowledges that he has injur'd us, a&s;ks forgivene&s;s, and &s;eeks recon|ciliation. But alas! too &s;oon the light withdraws: as in the tempe&s;tuous days of winter the &s;un darts a chearing ray, and is in&s;tantly hid from our eyes by the clo&s;ing clouds. Let us hope, Thirza, that as mild &s;pring re&s;tores light and joy to all nature, &s;o the heart of my unhappy hu&s;band may be re&s;tor'd to light and peace. For this we will ince&s;&s;antly petition Heaven. I have always nouri&s;h'd this hope in the bottom of my heart.</P>
<P>Thus &s;pake Mahala, when Thirza, pale and trembling, cry'd, What mounful &s;ound is that, &mdash; it comes from yon|der trees&mdash;it is not the cry of pain&mdash;from yonder trees&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Mahala!&mdash;alas! it comes nearer&mdash;O my God! &mdash;Thirza was now &s;inking to the ground, but her alarm'd &s;i&s;ter &s;upported her in her arms.</P>
<P>Adam, with tottering &s;teps, was coming from behind the trees, bending under the &s;ad load of his &s;on's lifele&s;s body. Eve walk'd by his &s;ide; &s;ometimes &s;he turn'd her face, fad|ed by grief, towards the bloody corp&s;e: then hid it under her hair, dropping with her tears.</P>
<P>Thirza continued pale and motionle&s;s in the trembling arms of Mahala, who was her&s;elf ready to &s;ink under the weight of her &s;he endeavour'd to &s;u&s;tain. Thus three ami|able virgins (but none ever felt &s;uch &s;ond affection) in a &s;ummer's eve walk hand in hand over the variegated fields. Sudden the thunders roars, the rapid lightening tears the earth under their &s;eet: terrify'd they fall: but &s;oon

<P>This was the &s;ituation of the two daughters of Adam, when, a little recovering, they beheld the corp&s;e of him they lov'd. The afflicted father had laid it on the gra&s;s, and was &s;upporting in his arms his fainting wife, who, weaken'd by grief, was near falling to the earth. Where am I, cry'd Thirza. O my God! where am I?&mdash;How he lies!&mdash;Abel&mdash;Why did I awake? Hateful light!&mdash;Ah un|happy that I am!&mdash;Mahala!&mdash;Ah me mi&s;erable!&mdash;See, &s;ee, my &s;i&s;ter, he lies dead!&mdash;Sight horrible!&mdash;Light hateful! &mdash;Why did I awake?</P>
<P>Thirza, cry'd Mahala, in a tremulous voice; let us not give way to vain terrors&mdash;to me&mdash;to me al&s;o the idea is dreadful as the forked lightning&mdash;Ah! &s;he again faints&mdash; Awake, Thirza&mdash;awake&mdash;Let us go to him. He is not dead: Thy voice, thine embraccs will rouze him from &s;leep.</P>
<P>After the&s;e words, the two &s;i&s;ters, leaning on each other, dragg'd their enfeebled limbs towards the body. Oh! my father, O my mother! how they weep!&mdash;What dreadful terrors &s;eize me! cry'd Thirza, as &s;he approach'd near the corp&s;e. Abel!&mdash;Abel!&mdash;my beloved!&mdash;my joy!&mdash;my life! &mdash;my hu&s;band!&mdash;awake. Ah unutterable wo! he wakes not!&mdash;Abel&mdash;hear my plaintive cries, the groans of thy di&s;tre&s;s'd wife!&mdash;She then ca&s;t her&s;elf on the body, to em|brace it with extended arms: but at the &s;ight of the blood, and fatal wound, &s;he, giving a terrifying &s;hriek, fell on the earth without voice, motion, or &s;ign of life; pale and cold as him &s;he mourn'd. De&s;pair was &s;een in her open and fix'd eye. Near her &s;at on the earth Mahala, di&s;&s;olv'd in tears; wringing her hands, &s;he &s;ometimes rais'd her weep|ing eyes to Heaven; &s;ometimes &s;he fix'd them with eager at|tention on the bloody corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Adam, who&s;e deep grief was augmented by the &s;orrows of his daughters, e&s;&s;ay'd to con&s;ole them: O my dear chil|dren! O Thirza! O Mahala! &s;aid he; would to God that my angui&s;h could keep from pain the hearts of tho&s;e I love: but, my beloved, hear me; li&s;ten to the &s;oft &s;ounds of con|&s;olation.

<P>Adam having fini&s;h'd digging the grave. Wake thou, &s;aid he to Thirza: wake my beloved. Let us obey the Divine command, and return the du&s;t to its mother Earth. Wake, my Thirza, he continu'd, and tenderly took her hand to rai&s;e her from the corp&s;e. She had been in a kind of trance on the body of her hu&s;band, and now wak'd from the holy vi&s;ion. Yes, I have &s;een him!&mdash;I have &s;een him! &s;he cry'd as &s;he aro&s;e. He came to me &s;hining in cele&s;tial lu&s;tre. Weep not, he &s;aid; weep not, my deare&s;t Thir|za! I am happy.

He laid it in the pit, and cover'd it with earth, and then &s;aid, Let us, my dear wife! Let us, my beloved chil|dren! adore the Mo&s;t High before this grave of the fir&s;t dead. They now all pro&s;trated them&s;elves before the grave, little Eliel and his brother kneeling on each &s;ide their mother, and the father of men pronounc'd in a loud voice this prayer, with his arms devoutly folded on his brea&s;t.</P>

<P>Adam ceas'd to &s;peak; but continued in &s;ilent exta&s;y, pro&s;trate on the earth: his wife and daughters &s;till kneel|ing at his &s;ide. Nature her&s;elf ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame &s;ilence; all was &s;erene; not a cloud pa&s;s'd over them through the lucid &s;ky.</P>
<P>Now came "on mild evening, clad in &s;ober gray," while every breeze was hu&s;h'd. During this perfect calm, Cain, pur&s;u'd by guilt, was agitated with fear, horror, re|mor&s;e and &s;ad di&s;may. He rov'd from place to place, he wander'd in the de&s;arts, till &s;pent with fatigue, he &s;at down facing the ri&s;ing moon, and thus the voice of his de&s;pair di&s;turb'd the peaceful &s;ilence that reign'd over all nature: There beyond that dark hill, the moon begins her cour&s;e, &s;preading around a faint light. All under the &s;tarry ex|pan&s;e imbibe new life from invigorating &s;leep; man only wakes. My accur&s;ed hand has driven from his dwelling peace and re&s;t. The voice of grief and lamentation a&s;|cends from the cottages. 'Tis I&mdash;'tis I, mi&s;erable! that have brought affliction to their abodes. The cries, the groans of my bewailing parents ri&s;e to Heaven as &s;o many accu&s;ations again&s;t me. This day&mdash;this accur&s;ed day, hear it, O Moon! turn pare and hide thy beams: Hear it, ye Stars! and &s;et in darkne&s;s: This day the earth has drank the blood of the fir&s;t &s;lain, &s;hed by my unnatural hand. Henceforth with-hold from me your precious in|fluences, bright luminaries! Curs'd on the ground I tread, bani&s;h'd from the chearful face of man. Hide me, hide me in gloomy darkne&s;s. I have &s;hed my brother's blood: I have torn the heart of him that begat me: I have fill'd with de&s;pair the brea&s;t of her who brought me forth and nouri&s;h'd my infancy. Hide me from the eyes of Nature, I have trampled on her dictates. I will fly&mdash;fly with my mi&s;ery, &s;ad companion! to &s;ome de&s;art region, where no human foot has mark'd the faded gra&s;s. I will dwell a|mong rocks and precipices, where putred water trickles in tears from the &s;teeps, into the &s;wampy abodes of loath&s;ome reptiles: where birds of prey build their ne&s;ts; where &s;a|vage bea&s;ts devour their bloody carnage: alas! even the&s;e will abhor me, they kill no brothers!

<P>Thus Cain bewail'd his wretchedne&s;s. He ceas'd, and &s;at abandon'd to mute grief. No bird of night di&s;turb'd the awful &s;tillne&s;s; frighted by &s;ounds of human wo, they fled in &s;ilence; a gentle murmur only floated through the air. Again he vents his &s;orrow, and ca&s;ting his melancholy eyes around, he cries, Pity me, ye woods! Weep for me, ye fields! No words can de&s;cribe my mi&s;ery, and pity is due to mi&s;ery. O Nature, array'd in beauty! grieve for me&mdash; for me, lo&s;t to beauty and to happine&s;s. Mourn for me each creature; ye ta&s;te, ye feel the efficacious pre&s;ence of a Gracious God, to me no longer gracious! I feel his wrath, I tremble at his power. He is to me only God the Avenger, the ju&s;t Avenger of my brother's blood. For ever will it cry again&s;t me: my puni&s;hment is endle&s;s.</P>
<P>He was now &s;ilent for &s;ome moments, then, with a deep &s;igh, he &s;aid, I weep! Can &s;uch a wretch as I &s;hed tears! Welcome precious drops, ye atte&s;t to me, that my mi&s;eries are &s;often'd. The de&s;pair which had &s;eiz'd my &s;oul, is chang'd to plaintive grief&mdash;to weeping &s;orrow. Ah flow my tears! receive them, O earth!

I will weep before them, and in the du&s;t deplore my guilt, and then&mdash;yes, then I fly for ever from their reproaching eyes. Fly from thee, Mahala! I fly for ever from my children! Here his agony &s;tifled his
<PB N="98" REF="011667_0097_0F87CB1EE14866A8">words, and he mov'd towards the cottages, watering with his tears the &s;olitary way.</P>
<P>He was now pa&s;&s;ing a little grove, planted by the hand of Abel, near the &s;pring. Cain then remember'd that his brother, when he had compleated his work, had &s;aid with fond affection, Flouri&s;h ye trees! &s;pread wide your branches! may ye for ever bloom, that under your refre&s;hing &s;hade our de&s;cendants may, in affectionate conver&s;e, relate to their offspring, what they will learn from us, &s;aying, Here Eve brought forth her fir&s;t-born. Here &s;he &s;ooth'd with her ca|re&s;&s;es his infant cries, him the fir&s;t &s;olace in her &s;ad exile. Here &s;he view'd him with inexpre&s;&s;ible rapture. She call'd him Cain, &s;aying, from the hand of the Lord have I re|ceiv'd thee. The murderer pa&s;s'd by this monument of his brother's tenderne&s;s with quicken'd &s;tep; a remor&s;eful &s;weat cover'd his averted face: his trembling knees could &s;carce &s;u&s;tain his weight. Thus at the &s;ight of his father's grave trembles the parricide, who with murtherous di&s;&s;i|mulation had invited the good old man, returning from the field, to refre&s;h him&s;elf with impoi&s;on'd viands. When he pa&s;&s;es the tomb, the ru&s;tling of the trees which &s;urround it, the odours of the garlands, with which his dutious &s;i&s;ters have crown'd the urn, rai&s;e a &s;torm in his guilty heart.</P>
<P>Now Cain had pa&s;s'd the terrifying grove, and drew near the cottages. The pale moon &s;hed on them a feeble light through the trees, and melancholy &s;ilence reign'd around. He ca&s;t on the dwellings his weeping eyes; he rais'd his hands to heaven; he wrung them in &s;peechle&s;s agony. Con&s;cious guilt tore his now &s;often'd heart. Trem|bling he &s;tood amid&s;t the dreary &s;tillne&s;s. At length he ut|ter'd in a low voice this impa&s;&s;ion'd &s;oliloquy.

<P>Cain having thus &s;poke, remain'd &s;till near the cottages. He groan'd, he rais'd his eyes to Heaven; when he heard the foot&s;teps of one advancing flowly through the gloom. A cold &s;hivering, like the agonies of death, &s;eiz'd his limbs. He &s;trove to fly; but in vain he &s;trove; he &s;unk down trembling, without &s;trength, among the bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>Thirza, this fir&s;t night of her &s;ad widowhood, unable to &s;leep, had quitted her lonely bed.

<P>Cain now pa&s;s'd at a di&s;tance from the grave, and ad|vanc'd towards his cottage. He frequently &s;topp'd, as ir|re&s;olute.

<P>Mahala was &s;itting on her &s;olitary bed, gazing with weeping eyes at the pale moon, more pale her&s;elf than that &s;tar when invelopp'd in clouds. Her infants were crying round her. At the &s;ight of her hu&s;band, &s;he gave a heart|piercing &s;hriek, and &s;ell on the bed &s;en&s;ele&s;s.

You have work'd a long while. Dear father! comfort our mother. Overcome with the conflict of his various pa&s;&s;ions, Cain could give no an&s;wer to the little innocents. He embrac'd them. He hugg'd them in his arms, while his tears ran on their faces. Then, unable to &s;upport his angui&s;h, he &s;ell on the earth, at the
