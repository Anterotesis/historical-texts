<P>THOUGH the Pamphlet, to which the following <HI>LETTER</HI> is an <HI>ANSWER,</HI> is pre|tended to have been originally de&s;igned only for the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> uncommon Pains have been taken to &s;pread it through this Kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ireland.</NOTE>, and e&s;pecially in the Northern Parts of it, among the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> there. The whole of it is written with &s;o virulent a Spirit, and with &s;o little regard to truth and candor, that it is hard to believe, what is confidently reported, that it has received great countenance from per&s;ons of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed eminence and authority, in the Church. But whether this be &s;o or not, it continues to be indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, and great u&s;e has been, and &s;till is made of it, for expo|&s;ing the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> and their wor&s;hip. It is not therefore to be wondered at, if, af|ter having long borne the&s;e in&s;ults with pa|tience, <HI>One of that Denomination</HI> thinks him&s;elf obliged to take &s;ome notice of a per|formance, which, becau&s;e it has hitherto been neglected, is pretended to be <HI>unan&s;wer|able.</HI> If any thing is &s;aid in a way of ne|ce&s;&s;ary

defence, which may be di&s;agreeable to &s;ome per&s;ons, it mu&s;t be laid to their charge, who, unprovoked, have endeavored to in&s;ult and expo&s;e tho&s;e, who were willing to be at peace with them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>THE editor of this <HI>American</HI> impre&s;&s;ion pre&s;umes that the above apology for troubling the public with an an&s;wer to the Black&s;mith, will now apply to this coun|try with as much propriety, as the author believed it would to Ireland when it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>PRESBYTERIANS have generally lived with Epi&s;co|palians here in peace and good humour. A full equa|lity of liberty with them&s;elves they heartily wi&s;hed the&s;e their brethren to enjoy, unmole&s;ted; and could not but hope for the &s;ame candid di&s;po&s;ition from them. It is with pain they receive the conviction of their di&s;appointment, from the extraordinary zeal with which the di&s;ciples of that communion have la|bored to publi&s;h and to circulate the fal&s;e and &s;curri|lous libel here noticed.</P>
<P>THE mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e of this writer could not de&s;cend to bedaub his antagoni&s;t or his party with colours corre&s;pondent to the dirt thrown by his pen.</P>
<P>SO far, however, as rea&s;on and truth can have any weight with the black&s;mith and his friends, it is not doubted they will find a &s;ufficient an&s;wer in the fol|lowing pages.</P>
<P>IF, indeed, they are plea&s;ed to plume them&s;elves on their author's &s;uperiority in ribaldry and abu&s;e; that is an honor of which we envy them not the unrivalled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But if they &s;hould appear to judge that this is the be&s;t time, for expo&s;ing to public ridicule the &s;uppo&s;ed defects in their neighbouring churches&mdash; M. Twogood and De Launc are not the only writers now ready to an&s;wer a fool according to his folly.</P></NOTE></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THOUGH I do not belong to the <HI>Right Reverend</HI> and <HI>Right Ho|norable</HI> cla&s;s of Men you have ad|dre&s;&s;ed, who &s;eem, by their utter Negligence of your Epi&s;tle, to be far above your in&s;tructions, or ri|dicule; yet, as I am a lover of Truth, and a friend to Liberty, and the Pre&s;s being as free to me as to any <HI>hammer-man</HI> in the <HI>Briti&s;h dominions,</HI> I &s;hall, without further ceremo|ny, &s;et about an&s;wering your letter, &s;o far as it de&s;erves any &s;erious notice; pre&s;erving that &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and decency which will not, I hope, be without its u&s;e, in freeing a very re&s;pectable part of the community from that du&s;t of your manufactory, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> with which you have &s;o liberally be&s;meared them.</P>
<P>THE whole of your charge again&s;t the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and its adherents, may be &s;ummed up in four particulars.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, relates to the public reading of the &s;crip|tures.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd, to p&s;almody.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021967_0005_0FB6596525C163D8">THE third, to the indecencies that attend the admi|ni&s;tration of the Lord's Supper.</P>
<P>AND the fourth, to extemporary prayer.</P>
<P>UPON each of the&s;e heads, you have collected what you think exceptionable, inconvenient, and defective; and I hope with impartiality to follow you in your re|marks, and to obviate your charge.</P>
<P>You fir&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, pages 7th and 8th, Newbury-port Edition.</NOTE> &s;ubmit it to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of the gentlemen of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> "whether a larger portion of the &s;criptures &s;hould not be read, every Lord's day, in their public a&s;&s;emblies," and you are, or pretend to be, "at a lo&s;s whether to a&s;cribe the negligence of this e&s;&s;ential part of their &s;ervice to the pride of the clergy, or the perver&s;ene&s;s of the people," &amp;c.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that according to the con&s;titution of that church, it is provided, that the <HI>canonical</HI> books of the &s;criptures &s;hould be read over in order; but &s;uch as mini&s;ter in holy things, are not tied down to a certain portion of them, in exclu&s;ion to the re&s;t, nor are they obliged to &s;ub&s;titute <HI>apocryphal,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>canonical</HI> wri|tings, in their public &s;ervice; but it is left to their pru|dence and free arbitration what, and how much, of the in&s;pired books &s;hall be read. Upon this account the cu&s;tom varies in almo&s;t every church; &s;ome read whole <HI>chapters</HI> without any comment; others make a few per|tinent remarks, according as pa&s;&s;ages are more or le&s;s difficult; others who are at more pains, proceed in a regular cour&s;e of explaining a certain number of ver|&s;es, 'till in this manner they go through all the &s;acred writings. I am inclinable to pay this compliment, Sir, to your knowledge of antiquity, as to believe you are not ignorant, that this method of in&s;truction took its ri&s;e very early in the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> church;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">We have rea&s;on to believe our Lord him&s;elf u&s;ed it, as is pretty plain from (Luke <HI>iv. 1</HI>&s;.) And in his di&s;cour&s;e with the two Di&s;ciples going to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> Luke <HI>xxiv. 27.</HI> And if we may judge of the manner of teach|ing u&s;ed by &s;ome of the Fathers, (See the works of <HI>Origen, Ba&s;il,</HI> and <HI>Au|gu&s;tin</HI>) by tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es that remain, it was chiefly expounding the Scriptures.</NOTE> and where it

hath been ob&s;erved &s;ince the <HI>reformation,</HI> as pretty ge|nerally it is among that people, and their adherents, who are cen&s;ured &s;o &s;everely by you, it mu&s;t be allow|ed that it hath tended exceedingly to the u&s;e of edify|ing; and it is quite natural that it &s;hould have this effect, as it gives the audience a very clear view of what is read to them, and impre&s;&s;eth &s;acred truths more deep|ly upon the mind.</P>
<P>AND to the honor of the laity of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I &s;hall mention it, as <HI>Paul</HI> commended the <HI>Be|reans;</HI> they are more univer&s;ally acquainted with the &s;criptures, than the laity of any other church what&s;oe|ver. If, therefore, from the methods u&s;ed among them, the happie&s;t con&s;equences have been and are produced; and if they are countenanced likewi&s;e by the be&s;t an|tiquity, what avails your ridicule on the pride of the clergy and Perver&s;ene&s;s of the people?</P>
<P>AS to your manner of rea&s;oning, Sir, again&s;t pulpit expo&s;itions, that by them "the under&s;tandings of the laity are put too much in the power of the clergy, and the &s;imple and ignorant are expo&s;ed to be &s;educed by the party principles and whim&s;ical opinions of the preacher," &amp;c. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that it holds equal|ly good again&s;t &s;ermonizing of every kind, and all comments upon the &s;criptures what&s;oever.</P>
<P>YOUR next charge again&s;t the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> re|&s;pects its p&s;almody<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, page <HI>11,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. "As to prai&s;e, you &s;ay, they &s;eem to &s;tudy to give this part of their wor&s;hip as much the air of ru&s;ticity and contempt of God as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;No|thing to engage or elevate the heart&mdash;the words ob&s;o|lete and low&mdash;the ver&s;ification mean and barbarous&mdash; the mu&s;ic har&s;h and ill performed&mdash;and the po&s;ture mo&s;t indecent."</P>
<P>AS to the fir&s;t part of this &s;evere accu&s;ation, where|in you a&s;&s;ume what belongs only to the Searcher of hearts, and characterize this &s;olemn &s;ervice as a direct

contempt of God, between you and Him who&s;e pro|vince is u&s;urped, let it re&s;t. I hope you will be brought to think more &s;eriou&s;ly and ju&s;tly of this important matter, and to acknowledge that where there is not a word uttered, or a &s;ound heard, there yet may be me|lody harmonious and acceptable.</P>
<P>THE words, &s;ome of them, may be ob&s;olete and low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ver&s;ion this Writer refers to, as commonly made u&s;e of in <HI>Scotland,</HI> has no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lete words, nor indeed &s;o many, as that of <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> which, for a long time, was generally made u&s;e of in the churches both of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;till is u&s;ed in many places: Nor is there any better ver&s;ion yet appointed by the public authority to be univer&s;ally u&s;ed. And if per&s;ons are at Liberty to u&s;e other ver&s;ions in the one Church, they are &s;o in the other: and it ought to be known, that a ver&s;ion again&s;t which this objection will not lie, collected, not only from the P&s;alms, but from ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> other &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages both of the old Te&s;tament and the new, has been compiled by the General A&s;&s;embly for the u&s;e of the church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that of Dr. Watts is generally u&s;ed in America.</NOTE>, but tho&s;e you condemn, are under no nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing the&s;e. Without the lea&s;t cen&s;ure, others may be, and by &s;ome are &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of them; and if we may judge of the elevation of the heart, from the united voices of the performers, the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and its adherents mu&s;t &s;ecure our charitable approbation. As p&s;almody makes up a very con&s;ide|rable part of the chri&s;tians' devotions, there are very few, of that denomination, who think it <HI>beneath them to &s;ing the prai&s;es of the</HI> Almighty; and, excepting in &s;ome remote country congregations, the mu&s;ic is far from being ill performed.</P>
<P>AS to the po&s;ture; where &s;uch a number join in &s;ing|ing, it would perhaps tend more to di&s;cord than to harmony, if they &s;hould all perform &s;tanding. When the po&s;ture is therefore of no importance, what adds to the harmony mu&s;t be principally attended to. But if any of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> communion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or any <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> di&s;&s;enter in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> or wherever this per&s;ua&s;ion is embraced, choo&s;e &s;tanding, or even kneeling in this &s;ervice, he is at his liberty, and may, unreproved, u&s;e the manner mo&s;t agreeable to him&s;elf.

I &s;hall only add, that in the few pa&s;&s;ages where this &s;er|vice is mentioned in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> there is as much countenance given to the &s;itting as to an erect or any other po&s;ture: thus, while our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour <HI>&s;at</HI> with his di&s;ciples admini&s;tring and in&s;tituting the &s;olemn &s;acra|ment of the &s;upper, before they &s;eparated, we are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxvi. 30. <HI>and Mark</HI> xiv. 26.</NOTE> and we have rea&s;on to believe it was before they ro&s;e from the table, (for there is no mention made of their changing their po&s;ture) they <HI>&s;ung an hymn</HI> or <HI>p&s;alm.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If the Black&s;mith's Quintilian were to fall into &s;ome of the e&s;tabli&s;hed churches of <HI>England,</HI> it is pre&s;umed he would not be le&s;s &s;truck with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le|ci&s;ms in ge&s;ture,</HI> if he &s;hould find the whole a&s;&s;embly fitting dumb, till the clerk alone had &s;ung out the P&s;alm; dictating it in the mean time to an un|meaning organ which is his only fellow-&s;inger; and as &s;oon as he has done with the in&s;pired words of the P&s;almi&s;t, the whole congregation &s;tanding up till he &s;ings over the unin&s;pired doxology.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT your principal outcry<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's letter, p. <HI>12,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> is, a|gain&s;t "the indecencies and follies that attend the ad|mini&s;tration of our Lord's &s;upper. You defy <HI>Italy,</HI> with all its &s;uper&s;tition, to produce a &s;cene better fitted to rai&s;e pity and regret in a religious, humane and un|der&s;tanding heart; or to afford an ampler field for ri|dicule to the carele&s;s and profane, than what they call a field-preaching upon one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions."&mdash;And, in which of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es you have ranked your&s;elf, it requires no great &s;agacity to di&s;cover. For here it is that your ridicule puts on its keene&s;t edge; and your wit and invention equally vie with each other.</P>
<P>I WILL not &s;ay that the charge you bring <HI>in every part</HI> is injurious and unju&s;t: but this may confidently be affirmed, that, as it is general and indi&s;criminate, and as far as it &s;trikes at the con&s;titution of the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it mu&s;t come under this cen&s;ure.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The Black&s;mith's low pun on the word <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> &s;eems de&s;igned to in&s;i|nuate that the church of Scotland called the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;upper by that name.

<P><PB N="10" REF="021967_0009_0FB6597779F3FBB8">FOR the benefit of tho&s;e who are in a great mea&s;ure &s;trangers to the u&s;ages of this church, re&s;pecting the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that, ever &s;ince the <HI>reformation,</HI> communicants in it have been very numerous: this, which is neither a fault nor an indecency, nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a labour extraordinary, to which no one man's abilities can be &s;uppo&s;ed equal. The neighbouring mini&s;ters, there|fore, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance is required, &s;ometimes draw after them a number from their re&s;pective churches, who may choo&s;e to put them&s;elves to a little trouble, rather than to enjoy at home a &s;ilent &s;abbath, or perhaps be obliged to attend mini&s;trations from which they could not expect &s;uch profit. But it is worthy of our notice, that if any of the &s;ober part from the neighbouring pa|ri&s;hes attend, with a de&s;ign to join in the participation of the memorials of our Saviour's Pa&s;&s;ion, they cannot be admitted, unle&s;s properly atte&s;ted from the mini&s;ters or officers of the churches to which they belong. This is not indecent, but de&s;ireably regular: if they are &s;pec|tators only, and do not communicate, this can be no detriment, but an incitement rather, to the devotion of tho&s;e who are more &s;olemnly engaged.</P>
<P>AND it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that the whole work, as far as it regards the regular members, is conducted with as much decency and as little &s;hare of confu&s;ion, as could well be expected, where &s;uch numbers have a right to be admitted, and cannot, merely to avoid a lit|tle inconveniency, be excluded.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be allowed, that while &s;ome, from the be&s;t and pure&s;t motives, are led to &s;uch ordinances, o|thers of the meaner cla&s;s, and who &s;eldom act from a|ny worthy principle, a&s;&s;emble with them likewi&s;e; ma|ny of the&s;e are hardened wretches, who in&s;tead of be|ing affected with the &s;olemn gravity around them, &s;eem to rejoice in &s;uch opportunities of &s;hewing them&s;elves <HI>ten times more</HI> the &s;ervants of the Devil.</P>
<P>IF then, Sir, there have been indecencies ob&s;erveable in any particular churches, among tho&s;e you would

cen&s;ure, they were, without doubt, principally occa&s;i|oned by the indi&s;cretions of unworthy &s;pectators, who croud to &s;uch &s;olemnities, and who cannot be re&s;train|ed from doing &s;o, unle&s;s, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> you who &s;eem to have the good of that church <HI>greatly</HI> at heart, would plea&s;e to &s;olicit for letters patent to make bolts and fetters to bind at home the irregular rabble. But while a mixed multitude is permitted, where many con|vene of various denominations, who neither fear God, nor honor the legi&s;lative power, it is not to be expect|ed but that there &s;hould be in&s;tances of folly and impi|ety to ca&s;t a melancholy &s;hade over &s;uch &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>THIS, however, I dare affirm, that of all the reform|ed churches, there are none more careful, with re&s;pect to their regular members, than that which your &s;atire would bring a reproach on. No per&s;ons can be ad|mitted to its privileges, without giving &s;ufficient evi|dence both of their knowledge as to the principles of <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> and of their moral character: if the lea&s;t &s;tain hath invaded this latter, they are obliged to give the fellow members of their community full &s;atisfacti|on, either of their innocence or of their repentance, before they are permitted to receive the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper. And in truth, &s;uch care is taken to pre&s;erve a pure church, by continual in&s;pection and enquiry, as de&s;erves the applau&s;e and imitation of all who lay claim to the character of <HI>reformed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I were di&s;po&s;ed, like this writer, to ca&s;t indi&s;criminate reflections on large churches and bodies of men, how ea&s;y would it be to recriminate, and to produce the te&s;timony of his own church, on many accounts very re&s;|pectable, which yet acknowledges and laments the want of a <HI>Godly Di&s;ci|pline!</HI> But the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;tands in no need of being commended at the expence of any other.

but among all denominations of <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> there is nothing new or &s;ingular in this; and would it not be very wrong to bring an <HI>odium</HI> upon a body of men for the indi&s;cretions of individuals? Ju&s;t as the caviller at our mo&s;t noble con&s;titution would de&s;erve to be de&s;pi|&s;ed, who&s;e malevolence would &s;hade its lu&s;tre, becau&s;e mi&s;creants have attempted to di&s;turb its tranquility.</P>
<P>BUT, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> if all the wicked of the earth &s;hould join together, and be aided with all that your vilifying genius could &s;ugge&s;t, to render a &s;acred &s;olem|nity ridiculous, this mu&s;t not, and with the &s;olid rea|&s;oners and ju&s;t thinkers among our readers, will not, bring any reproach upon the &s;ober and &s;erious part, who form the body, as in truth they are by far the majority, of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> or Prote&s;tant <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> Tho&s;e who have in the lea&s;t incurred your cen&s;ure, will, I hope, be taught by you, (for we may take a hint even from an enemy) for the future to enter into &s;uch prudential &s;chemes as may &s;ecure them from every thing indecent or irregular. And it is the peculiar happine&s;s of the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and its adherents, that this can be effected without the interpo&s;ition of <HI>Synod, A&s;&s;embly,</HI> or <HI>Convocation.</HI></P>

univer&s;al con&s;ent and opinion of mankind is a conclu|&s;ive argument, when applied to the fir&s;t and greate&s;t article of religion, the exi&s;tence of God, it mu&s;t be &s;o too with re&s;pect to the be&s;t and fitte&s;t way of wor&s;hip|ping him."</P>
<P>BEFORE I enter into the merits of this argument, I mu&s;t beg to be heard a little, as to my own private opinion of prayer, and its requi&s;ites. If we under&s;tand the nature of prayer, di&s;putes about the manner of offer|ing up our addre&s;&s;es, will be the more ea&s;ily adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE nature of this &s;olemn duty, I apprehend, may be expre&s;&s;ed in few words. It is a lifting up of the mind towards God, the Fountain of all good, with humble reque&s;ts for &s;uch things as we want or &s;tand in need of, and are agreeable to the will of God; who, by all that profe&s;s them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> is to be ad|dre&s;&s;ed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, with a general or particular confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and thankful acknow|ledgments for the continual and merciful &s;upplies of his providence and grace; &s;hewing the &s;en&s;e of our minds either in the language of the heart, or in the expre&s;&s;ion of this language by proper words.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, is a ju&s;t de&s;cription of prayer; and if we apply the debates about the manner of wor&s;hip to any part of it, I think they mu&s;t appear very frivo|lous. Who dare &s;ay, that &s;tated forms, are &s;o ab&s;o|lutely and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the due performance of this duty, as that without them there can be no acceptance? And on the other hand, would it be le&s;s pre&s;umption, to exclude from the favorable regards of the Deity, all &s;tated forms of devotion? Upon this ac|count we &s;hould be very cautious of condemning tho&s;e of either party, who differ from us in this matter;
<PB N="16" REF="021967_0015_0FB659886F782150">
for it mu&s;t be granted, that though we may di&s;agree in the manner of offering up our addre&s;&s;es, yet the &s;pirit of devotion may not be wanting in which ever way we choo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE experiences of many valuable and &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, prove the truth of this; while they evidently &s;hew the ra&s;hne&s;s and folly of the blind cen&s;urer. What are forms or modes of wor&s;hip, when compared with the graces of faith, love, humility, &s;incerity, contrition, re&s;ignation, and tho&s;e holy de&s;ires, and devout affections, which are the life and &s;oul of prayer? As for tho&s;e, therefore, who join with you, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> in &s;peaking di&s;re&s;pectfully of the manner u&s;ed by the church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it's adherents, calling it cant, jargon, bla&s;phemous effu&s;i|ons, <HI>Pre&s;byterian in&s;piration,</HI> and the like, let all who would de&s;ire to act as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> pity and pray for you; but let them beware of imitating a rudene&s;s, &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with all the rules of religion and charity, as well as good manners.</P>
<P>I SHALL now enter upon this di&s;agreeable argument, but it &s;hall be in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, and &s;o as not, de&s;ignedly, to give offence to any, who in their wor&s;hip, make u&s;e of precompo&s;ed forms; and as what I write is intended to be of general &s;ervice to all who can think or judge of this &s;ubject, my remarks &s;hall be brief, and plain as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>YOUR fir&s;t argument, as already laid down, is taken from the univer&s;al con&s;ent and practice of mankind, which, as you alledge, "If it be fitly applied to the proof of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t article of religion, the exi&s;tence of God, mu&s;t be equally con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;ive, with re&s;pect to the be&s;t and fitte&s;t way of wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ing him." I an&s;wer, that though the univer&s;al con&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> nations, even the mo&s;t barbarous, is a &s;trong pre&s;umptive evidence, in favor of this propo&s;ition, that there is a God, yet their idolatrous or &s;uper&s;titious manner of wor&s;hipping him, can never be brought in as a proper

model for our &s;ervices; who are, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel of his Son, taught to <HI>wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> In this matter, therefore, the practices of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Magi</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> cannot be of the lea&s;t advantage to the arguments for &s;tated forms.</P>
<P>BUT you alledge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter, p. <HI>23.</HI></NOTE> that "God him&s;elf pre&s;cribed this way of wor&s;hip to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that our Saviour ho|nored and &s;anctified it by his pre&s;ence and practice, and authorized it by his command."</P>
<P>IF the&s;e things are &s;o, tho&s;e who pray without &s;tated forms, are wrong indeed; but they mu&s;t be made ap|pear, before we yield up our liberty in the free way of wor&s;hip. With re&s;pect to the <HI>Jews,</HI> it would help &s;peedily to determine the debate, if the <HI>books</HI> or <HI>chap|ters</HI> of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> were pointed out that contain|ed the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Hebrew</HI> liturgy. But though <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> their eminent hi&s;torian, hath given us an account of that which was compo&s;ed by <HI>Ezra,</HI> who was the fir&s;t of the order of the <HI>Scribes,</HI> and though the learned and laborious Doctor <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> hath <HI>happily</HI> retrieved one for us out of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbins;</HI> yet as I do not find them in my <HI>Bible,</HI> nor countenanced by <HI>the &s;ure word of prophecy,</HI> I mu&s;t, as to my own opinion, be greatly influenced by the declaration of him, who par|ticularly addre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who were <HI>more than ordinary zealous for the traditions of the fathers,</HI> &s;aid unto them, <HI>In vain do ye wor&s;hip me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</HI></P>
<P>IT is granted that in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, and un|der certain circum&s;tances, petitions and ackowledg|ments to this or the other purpo&s;e, or perhaps a form of ble&s;&s;ing were pre&s;cribed, which extended to indivi|duals in the&s;e circum&s;tances: but it cannot in the lea&s;t affect our argument, unle&s;s an univer&s;al, invariable form, &s;uch as was to &s;uit per&s;ons of every age, and of every &s;tate; and &s;uch as was u&s;ed by all the great and good

<P>DID the humble <HI>publican,</HI> though in the <HI>temple,</HI> read his prayers? Or where had the proud <HI>phari&s;ee</HI> his vaunt|ing form?</P>
<P>BESIDES, Sir, &s;ince you have &s;o ingeniou&s;ly u&s;ed our Saviour's attendance on Synagogue-Wor&s;hip, as an ar|gument for adopting their manner, why not their mat|ter al&s;o? Or will you pretend to &s;ay that our Saviour, in his attendance upon the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;ervice, paid more defer|ence to the form than to the matter?

<P>IN &s;upport of what you recommend, you further af|firm, that our Saviour &s;anctified forms of prayer by his practice: "for in his agony in the garden, he ro&s;e up,
<PB N="25" REF="021967_0024_0FB659A7E0EA6C10">
awakened and rebuked the di&s;ciples, returned to the &s;ame place, and repeated the &s;ame form of words three times over."</P>
<P>IF the <HI>evangeli&s;ts</HI> had &s;aid that our Saviour exactly repeated the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions three times over, nothing could be concluded from thence for &s;tated invariable forms of prayer in public wor&s;hip. Our Lord's cir|cum&s;tances were then of a peculiar nature, and the petitions he offered, turned upon one point: and he who would argue, that we ought always to repeat the &s;ame words in prayer, becau&s;e <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in the&s;e pe|culiar circum&s;tances did &s;o, would &s;hew him&s;elf a piti|able rea&s;oner; but the truth is, the fact it&s;elf is mi&s;re|pre&s;ented, and the evangeli&s;ts them&s;elves witne&s;s again&s;t you.</P>
<P>THE words of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> are the&s;e, [&s;ee <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 36, <HI>&amp;c.] Then cometh Je&s;us with them, unto a place called Geth&s;emane, and &s;aith unto the di&s;ciples, &s;it ye here, while I go and pray yonder.&mdash;And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, &s;aying, O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this cup pa&s;s from me, neverthele&s;s, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, Sir, is what you are plea&s;ed to call the form, and to a&s;&s;ert that our Saviour repeated it three times over; but in the <HI>evangeli&s;t's</HI> account there is a remark|able variation in our Lord's &s;econd prayer. For he tells us, that after mode&s;tly chiding his di&s;ciples, and at the &s;ame time apologizing for their weakne&s;s, <HI>he went away a|gain the &s;econd time, and prayed, &s;aying, O my Father, if this cup may not pa&s;s from me except I drink it, thy will be done.</HI></P>
<P>IN the account of the evangeli&s;t St. <HI>Mark,</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> xiv. 36.</NOTE> there is &s;till a greater variation.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 44.</NOTE> And St. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, that <HI>being in agony, he prayed more earne&s;tly;</HI> which we may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e the evangeli&s;t relates of his third prayer, for he &s;ays that after returning to, and exhorting his di&s;ciples, <HI>while he yet &s;pake,</HI> a multitude, and <HI>Judas</HI> with them, came to apprehend him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But perhaps becau&s;e it is &s;aid, in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Mark</HI> accord|ing to our tran&s;lation, that <HI>he prayed &s;aying the &s;ame words.</HI> (Matt. <HI>xxvi. 44.</HI> Mark <HI>xiv. 39.</HI>) the meaning mu&s;t be, that he u&s;ed preci&s;ely the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions. A man of learning, as you, Mr. <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> take up|on you to be, ought to know, however, that the pa&s;&s;age in the original, in both Evangeli&s;ts, runs thus, <HI>TON AUTON LOGON EIPOON, LOGOS</HI> is not expre&s;&s;ed in the plural number, and therefore is improperly rendered <HI>Words,</HI> as it might have been, if <HI>REMATA</HI> had been made u&s;e of. It is well known that <HI>LOGOS</HI> admits of various Significations, and is variou&s;ly rendered by our Tran&s;lators. In <HI>Luke xx. 3.</HI> they tran&s;late it <HI>Thing.</HI> In <HI>Acts viii. 21.</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Acts xv. 6</HI> and <HI>Acts xix. 28.</HI> it is tran&s;lated <HI>Matter.</HI> In <HI>Romans ix. 28.</HI> it is rendered <HI>Work.</HI> And in <HI>Act x. 29.</HI> it is rendered <HI>Intent,</HI> and might be rendered <HI>Purpo&s;e.</HI> That pa&s;&s;age, therefore, in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> might have been properly rendered, <HI>&s;peaking the &s;ame Thing</HI> or <HI>Matter.</HI> Or if the original had it that he &s;pake the &s;ame <HI>REMATA,</HI> though this al&s;o is u&s;ed to &s;ignify Things as well as Words, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood thus, that he &s;pake words to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; except we make the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> contra|dict them&s;elves; &s;ince, as hath been already &s;hewed, the Words, as recorded by them, are not preci&s;ely the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions, though to the &s;ame Sen&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021967_0025_0FB659A9A1E87350">THIS then, Sir, makes nothing in your favor: And all that can be gathered from it is, that our Saviour being under a particular pre&s;&s;ure, from the full pro&s;pect of his approaching &s;ufferings, returned thrice to the &s;ame &s;ubject&mdash;not barely <HI>&s;aying the &s;ame words</HI>&mdash;but as his mind dwelt upon this matter, &s;o his devotion ran upon it, and his words were to one effect.</P>
<P>IF, however, we con&s;ider, the &s;ea&s;on of the night, the admonition of our Lord to his Di&s;ciples to <HI>watch and pray,</HI> or his own example&mdash;we mu&s;t conclude, from this pa&s;&s;age, that free prayer is not without the &s;tronge&s;t arguments to enforce it.</P>
<P>AS another recommendation of &s;tated forms, you a&s;&s;ert that our Saviour "Before he expired on the cro&s;s, offered up his devotions in the words of the twenty-&s;econd <HI>P&s;alm.</HI>"</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that, therefore, any man in imitation of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> example, may freely choo&s;e out and apply to his own ca&s;e, or the ca&s;e of others, &s;uch &s;criptural expre&s;&s;ions as &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;uitable to them. For our Lord, upon this mournful occa&s;ion, does not make u&s;e of the prayers he had formerly offered, nor that form or pattern which he had given to his Di&s;ciples; but finding his ca&s;e to be then very &s;ingular, he mov|ingly expo&s;tulates, not in the language of the whole
<PB N="27" REF="021967_0026_0FB659AFC94D31F0">
<HI>P&s;alm,</HI> but in part of the words of the fir&s;t ver&s;e. <HI>My God! my God! why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> I &s;hall be judged by the unprejudiced, if the abettors of free prayer could wi&s;h for a &s;tronger plea in their favor.</P>
<P>YOUR next a&s;&s;ertion is, that the Son of God hath "authorized &s;tated forms of prayer by his command." The place indeed is not mentioned where this com|mand is given, and I mu&s;t own I do not recollect it; but as our Lord's comprehen&s;ive prayer is immediately referred to, it is probable, that it relates to the manner in which one of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> introduceth it.</P>
<P>THIS prayer is indeed the be&s;t, the mo&s;t full and perfect that ever was compo&s;ed in the world; and if ever any form was intended to have been invariably u&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian church, this was it: I will not pre&s;ume to i&s;&s;ue the controver&s;y, whether the Ble&s;&s;ed Author of it intended that we &s;hould, in our devotions, word for word, abide by this <HI>Formula.</HI> I &s;hall only of|fer a few things relating to this que&s;tion, leaving it to the judgment of the reader to determine as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>THAT it was only de&s;igned as a divine rule or mo|del of prayer, not as a preci&s;e form, &s;eems to appear from this con&s;ideration:</P>
<P>THAT our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf, as far as we can find, never &s;o much as once u&s;ed it, upon all tho&s;e various occa&s;ions which he afterwards had of praying, to the Father; though it is very ob&s;ervable, and I have often remarked it with plea&s;ure, that the petitions he offered up, various as they were, are all of them redu|cible, to one or other of tho&s;e, which are contained in his mo&s;t excellent &s;ummary.</P>
<P>AND as our Saviour did not, &s;o we have no account that ever his apo&s;tles joined in the u&s;e of this prayer in their a&s;&s;emblies, or that they &s;o much as once u&s;ed it, though for them&s;elves and the church of God, the pe|titions they offered, were likewi&s;e conformable to this divine pattern, which, in his excellent &s;ermon on the Mount, our Lord had &s;hewed them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021967_0027_0FB659B595EA69A0">BESIDES, had it been the intention of our Saviour, to bind his followers to the u&s;e of the&s;e words invari|ably, is it not probable that the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> would have recorded them without the lea&s;t variation?

<P>FROM which compari&s;on it is a rea&s;onable pre&s;ump|tion, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in this prayer, intended no more than to give his di&s;ciples, and all faithful <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> to the end of the world, a divine directory&mdash;not an invariable form of devotion.

it, <HI>after this manner pray ye.</HI> If we take this as an ex|pre&s;s command of our Lord, whenever we pray, to u&s;e this form, it will prove that we ought never to u&s;e any other expre&s;&s;ions in our addre&s;&s;es to God, than tho&s;e in this prayer.

<P>BESIDES, there are &s;ome men of learning, who hold that this prayer of our Lord was not de&s;igned for the perpetual u&s;e of the church, but only for a temporary form: To this purpo&s;e they ob&s;erve, that the three fir&s;t petitions, <HI>hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done,</HI> &amp;c &s;eem to be calculated chiefly for the dawn of the Chri&s;tian Church; for that period, when according to the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his forerunner, and to the expectation of the pious <HI>Jews, the kingdom of God was at hand.</HI> They ob&s;erve farther, that in the petition for forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, there is not the lea&s;t mention made of the &s;acrifice, the death, or blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in virtue whereof we mu&s;t now &s;ue for pardon; whereas our Saviour, after his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;i|on, is every where propo&s;ed, as our High Prie&s;t, Me|diator, Interce&s;&s;or and Advocate, of which there is no notice taken in this form. And therefore they &s;uppo&s;e that, upon this account, a con&s;iderable time after it's delivery, our Lord tells his di&s;ciples, <HI>hitherto have ye a&s;ked nothing in my name, a&s;k and ye &s;hall receive.</HI> They ob&s;erve likewi&s;e that the <HI>Doxologies</HI> mentioned in Scrip|ture after our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, lead us directly and expre&s;sly, to a&s;cribe our prai&s;es to God by Chri&s;t, or in his name, of which there is not the lea&s;t hint in our Lord's prayer. The&s;e are the ob&s;ervations of men who hold it as a form, &s;uited chiefly to the &s;tate of the Di&s;ciples, while under our Saviour's per&s;onal mi|ni&s;try.

as we can learn, have commanded the very words of this prayer to be u&s;ed, though this may be done with profit; but the original de&s;ign &s;eems to be, that the matter of our prayers, &s;hould be deduced from thence.</P>
<P>I SHALL now, Sir, pur&s;ue the hi&s;tory of prayer through the &s;ub&s;equent periods of the Church, that it may appear how groundle&s;s, how incon&s;i&s;tent with all truth your a&s;&s;ertion is, "that the pre&s;ent extemporary way of wor&s;hip, is contrary to the practice and opini|nion of all mankind in all ages, &amp;c. until it was in|troduced amid&s;t the ferment and confu&s;ion of the fif|teenth century."</P>
<P>IN all the accounts we have of the ardent devotions of the Apo&s;tles and pious Martyrs, whether for them|&s;elves or their fellow-&s;ufferers, none of them are re|corded in the &s;ame words, nor any of them in the ex|pre&s;s phra&s;es of our Lord's prayer, or of the prayers u&s;ed by &s;uch as were before them in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>AFTER our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, it was the con&s;tant and laudable practice of the Church, to a&s;&s;emble for the &s;olemn acts of devotion, and to eat and to drink in remembrance of his pa&s;&s;ion. But where do we find the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> liturgy? In what <HI>book</HI> or <HI>chapter</HI> of the <HI>New Te&s;tament?</HI> The &s;ub&s;tance of many devotional exerci&s;es are recorded, but not a &s;yllable to countenance the opinion that they prayed by a pre&s;cribed form. The mo&s;t eminent names of the three fir&s;t <HI>centuries</HI> might here be mentioned as a perfect illu&s;tration of this truth. The&s;e primitive profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> faith, under the mo&s;t cruel tortures, cea&s;ed not the highe&s;t acts of devotion and charity, offering up their &s;everal prayers for the &s;uffering church, and even for their tormentors and enemies; but never &s;ervilely followed, nor pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly pre&s;cribed to others, in an Exerci&s;e where|in their own hearts, and the particular circum&s;tances of their &s;eparate communities were principally con|cerned.</P>

And as for the liturgies which bear the names of St. <HI>James</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and &s;ome other of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> it is very well known, and acknowledged by the greate&s;t friends of e&s;tabli&s;hed forms, that they are fal&s;e and &s;purious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See <HI>Echard's</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>IF it be &s;aid, that the Apo&s;tles were in&s;pired, and therefore did not &s;tand in need of any form, I an&s;wer, that their qualifications by In&s;piration, rendered them the fitter to pre&s;cribe and impo&s;e a Liturgy for the fu|ture u&s;e of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, if they had thought this nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BUT indu&s;trious as they were, to promote the cau&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> we do not find that ever they attempt|ed to en&s;lave men's minds in any yoke of bondage. We have each of them in his own words offering up his own reque&s;ts, and none of them tied down to any form; as might be in&s;tanced in the prayer that was put up by the Church, after the Di&s;ciples, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> had been impri&s;oned, examined, threatened and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim.</HI> After this we have likewi&s;e an account of <HI>Stephen's</HI> per&s;ecution, of his mo&s;t rational defence, pious and devout behaviour, and patient martyrdom; but his petitions being con|ceived in other words than tho&s;e of the above-men|tioned prayer, and &s;uch as his peculiar circum&s;tan|ces, and truly <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;pirit dictated, we may be fully a&s;&s;ured, that he had no notion of any preconceived form; and if he had thought that even the recital of our Lord's prayer was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, he would not have omitted it, and gone to death, offering up on|ly

<P>THE Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> on his coins and medals, is repre&s;ented in a praying po&s;ture, not as reading, but with eyes lift up to Heaven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He who would &s;ee a full an&s;wer to what has been alledged to &s;hew that public pre&s;cribed Liturgies were of early Antiquity in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church, may con&s;ult the learned Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on's</HI> di&s;cour&s;e concerning <HI>Litur|gies:</HI> And Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on's</HI> Review of Liturgies in an&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Bennet.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I have traced the hi&s;tory of prayer, from the earlie&s;t account of time, which we certainly have in the records of the bible; and I flatter my&s;elf that from the days of <HI>Adam,</HI> 'till the commencement of <HI>chri&s;tia|nity,</HI> and from that during the apo&s;tolic and pure&s;t ages of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church, it will appear, that we have ma|ny examples of free prayer; but not one in&s;tance of a liturgy acknowledged as authentic, or warranted by di|vine authority, can be produced. And I would hope, Sir, that were not your countenance too deeply &s;ooted over, it would betray at this di&s;covery of your &s;hameful partiality, &s;ome &s;ymptoms of mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>INDEED every hone&s;t enquirer after truth mu&s;t be fully &s;atisfied, that the method of addre&s;&s;ing the Su|preme Being, u&s;ed by the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and its ad|herents, had an earlier and &s;urer foundation than what you are plea&s;ed to a&s;cribe it to, "the ferment and con|fu&s;ion of the fifteenth century."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="021967_0033_0FB659CB1CBE5A48">BUT pray, Sir, what was this ferment and confu&s;ion? Where was it? And how did it &s;erve to introduce the pre&s;ent extemporary way of wor&s;hip? This, Sir, is gratifying your remarkable genius; for I am per&s;uaded that the hi&s;torians of that age will leave it &s;olely to your own invention, to make out proper an&s;wers to the&s;e que&s;tions. And, if we may judge from your pa&s;t la|bors, it is not to be doubted, but you will yet convince the world, that the <HI>Black&s;mith</HI> can never be at a lo&s;s for <HI>forgeries.</HI></P>
<P>IT is plain, Sir, that in talking of "the ferment and confu&s;ion of the fifteenth century," you intend to ca&s;t a &s;lur upon the reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;o far you &s;erve the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> cau&s;e; though you are out in your <HI>chronology;</HI> for it was not 'till about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century that the reformation took place there. And if there was any ferment or confu&s;ion at that time, which was principally owing to the oppo&s;ition of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> faction, and the cruel and perfidious methods they made u&s;e of, as this did not hinder the church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from throwing off the errors and corruptions of <HI>Popery,</HI> &s;o it did not hinder them from &s;ettling their doctrine and wor&s;hip in that manner which they judg|ed mo&s;t conformable to the fir&s;t and pure&s;t times of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church.</P>
<P>IT appears from what has been offered, that the mo&s;t primitive and &s;criptural method of addre&s;s, when we approach the Supreme Being, is by what is commonly called <HI>extempore</HI> or free prayer.</P>
<P>IF it is duly con&s;idered, this al&s;o will be found the mo&s;t natural way. All divine acceptable prayer, it is allow|ed, &s;hould take its ri&s;e from the heart, and &s;hould re|ceive its fir&s;t formation there. But when words are pre&s;cribed, the natural order is inverted; the affections are brought to the words, in&s;tead of the words flowing from the affections. Something of this is experienced by per&s;ons truly devout: they are often pro&s;trate before God, pouring forth their hearts with an overflowing
<PB N="35" REF="021967_0034_0FB659CEC80613C0">
and indulgence of expre&s;&s;ion, which exceeds all the or|naments of oratory. The&s;e are not "rude and &s;hock|ing &s;cenes, bla&s;phemous petitions," as you, Sir,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, p. <HI>46.</HI></NOTE> are plea&s;ed overha&s;tily to call them, when you tell us, that you have "often trembled to &s;ee the ignorant, proud Enthu&s;ia&s;t approach his Maker, with as great familiarity as he would his neighbour, and kneel down with his family to his extemporary wor&s;hip." There is no doubt, but that the ignorance and weakne&s;s of &s;ome, may need the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;et forms; e&s;pecially when they pray with others; and therefore &s;uch helps are al|lowed and recommended to them. But after all, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the rules of grammar and oratory, are none of the e&s;&s;ential parts of prayer. The &s;pirit of God may be &s;ent forth to help the infirmities of his children, and to enable them to pray; it may &s;often the heart, warm the affections, and teach them to cry, <HI>Abba Father!</HI> But we do not &s;ay, that it will teach them the beauties of rhetoric, or an ea&s;y flowing &s;tyle; for as the&s;e are too mean to have any &s;tre&s;s laid upon them by wi&s;e or good men, much le&s;s by the Almighty. <HI>Out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings,</HI> of weak and illi|terate <HI>Chri&s;tians, he can perfect</HI> his own <HI>prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>GOD <HI>&s;ees not as man &s;ees;</HI> he has not tho&s;e views of what entertains our &s;en&s;es, nor tho&s;e affections and de&s;ires towards them which we have. We may be de|lighted with the elegancy of a form; with devotion pompous and magnificent; with curious &s;culptures, nice paintings, and the melody of &s;ounds; but to think thus of Him, <HI>who dwells not in temples made with hands,</HI> is no le&s;s &s;en&s;ual, gro&s;s and irrational in us, than un|worthy of Him who is an infinitely pure &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE language in which he is addre&s;&s;ed, may be bro|ken and uncouth, but <HI>&s;uch pity as a father &s;heweth unto his children, &s;uch pity &s;heweth the Lord to them that fear Him;</HI> and he that <HI>uttereth the truth in his heart,</HI> though his words are not the mo&s;t accurate, yet they
<PB N="36" REF="021967_0035_0FB659DB0F06A248">
are not the lea&s;t acceptable. Even among men, an af|fectionate tender parent, will not de&s;pi&s;e the ju&s;t and dutiful reque&s;ts of his child, though the words are but half pronounced. And <HI>if we that are evil, know how to</HI> treat our offspring in this manner; who dare &s;ay what that addre&s;s is, which &s;hall be rejected by the Almighty? But e&s;pecially, who dare &s;ay, that the prayer which proceeds from upright intentions, and a broken &s;en&s;ible heart, though it be but lamely uttered, &s;hall not find acceptance?</P>
<P>I ALLOW that it is nece&s;&s;ary and commendable in us to endeavour that our wants and de&s;ires &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed by &s;uitable words: Sometimes the mo&s;t im|proved <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> may labor under a pre&s;ent deadne&s;s of &s;pirit, and indi&s;po&s;edne&s;s for any exerci&s;e, that may re|quire much attention. In &s;uch di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances, that they may aptly and pertinently expre&s;s them&s;elves, it is very nece&s;&s;ary that the matter, as well as the order of their addre&s;&s;es, &s;hould for &s;ome time before they engage in this duty, be much thought upon. Then, he who hath made any tolerable pro|ficiency in religion, who hath been conver&s;ant with the holy &s;criptures, and with divine &s;ubjects; but e&s;|pecially who hath &s;tudied his own heart, and its various frames; will, through that grace which is ever con|ferred upon him who a&s;keth it aright, ea&s;ily &s;urmount all pre&s;ent languor, and gain divine enlargement in this duty.</P>
<P>OTHERS who have their minds furni&s;hed very poor|ly with ideas, or who through di&s;u&s;e may have con|tracted an utter inability for this &s;ervice, may perhaps find their thoughts better expre&s;&s;ed in precompo&s;ed forms, and may receive con&s;iderable benefits from them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That this is agreeable to the &s;entiments of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be &s;een, if the reader will give him&s;elf the trouble of con&s;ulting the <HI>A&s;|&s;embly's</HI> Directory&mdash;page <HI>9.</HI> Direct. <HI>9.

<P>THOSE who cannot go without them, may make u&s;e of them; but a little a&s;&s;iduity in the exerci&s;e of prayer, and &s;ome farther acquaintance with God and their own hearts, will, in time, furni&s;h, even weak <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> both with matter and words, without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE occurrences, for in&s;tance, of every day, as the mercies, trials, temptations, and deliverances of it, will furni&s;h matter for prayer. In the morning, the view and pro&s;pect of what is before us, or may befall us, will lead our addre&s;&s;es; and in the evening, if we have received &s;ignal favors, or have e&s;caped imminent dan|gers, or have felt the prevalency of temptations, our devotion will favor of the&s;e things. In a word, as our hearts are u&s;ually formed according to our occa&s;ions and circum&s;tances, the&s;e are &s;o very variable, that our prayers cannot be always the &s;ame, without being, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, le&s;s natural and pertinent.</P>
<P>WHEN we are reduced to great extremity, and know not where to flee for relief, how natural is it to &s;eek &s;helter under the &s;hadow of the Divine wings? When, with the di&s;ciples, we are in danger of &s;hipwreck; or, with <HI>Paul</HI> for our rebelliou&s;ne&s;s, to be <HI>&s;truck down to the earth;</HI> how apt are we to be in&s;tant and earne&s;t in our applications for mercy and &s;alvation? It cannot be &s;aid of the former, that their earne&s;t addre&s;s, <HI>help, Lord, el&s;e we peri&s;h;</HI> or of the latter, who&s;e fir&s;t petition was, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> I &s;ay, it can|not be affirmed, that the&s;e were the re&s;ult of &s;tudy or premeditation; or that they were parts of precompo&s;ed collects: Yet the prayer-hearing God did not reject the&s;e "<HI>extempore</HI> effu&s;ions;" hereby inviting us always to con&s;ider his providences, and to &s;uit our petitions accordingly."</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e extraordinary occurrences, there may be other ca&s;es, wherein it would be very improper <PB N="38" REF="021967_0037_0FB659DDE292C0F8">
that our devotion &s;hould be fettered with form. A well-prepared mind, that hath a perfect comprehen&s;ion of its own &s;tate, as well as of what relates to the church of God, or to the civil community, of which he is a member; and hath been long exerci&s;ed, &s;ometimes with much enlargement and &s;ucce&s;s, in this duty of prayer, cannot be diverted from it, 'till he is authori&s;ed by law and form to begin it. Though all men &s;hould be &s;ilent, he will take with him words, and, as the ca&s;e requireth, &s;upplicate the &s;upreme Over-ruler.</P>
<P>I CANNOT better expre&s;s my &s;entiments upon this point, than in the language of the excellent Prelate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins'</HI> Gift of Prayer, p. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE>, before referred to.

<P>IN an&s;wer to which, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the de|fenders of free prayer always di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;pirit and the gift of prayer. By the &s;pirit of prayer, they under&s;tand tho&s;e inward holy de&s;ires and devout affections which the Holy Spirit forms and excites in the minds of good men, and which are the Life and &s;oul of our external &s;ervices. By the gift of prayer, they under&s;tand, an ability of chu&s;ing &s;uitable matter, and offering it up to God, in expre&s;&s;ions fit to repre&s;ent our inward pious de&s;ires on all emergen|cies. The gift may be the effect of pains, applicati|on, and frequent exerci&s;e in this duty; and may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of the Spirit of Prayer. Where the Gift is wanting, which, in any <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> is a very great defect, Forms are allowable, and the Holy Spirit may be a&s;&s;i&s;ting, in &s;uch ca&s;es, as well as where &s;uch helps are not u&s;ed. But tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with the Gift, may have, al&s;o, the a&s;&s;i&s;tan|ces of the Spirit, exciting their devout affections, en|lightening their minds to under&s;tand their &s;piritual ne|ce&s;&s;ities, and directing them in the matter of their prayers, by bringing the promi&s;es of God to their re|membrance; &s;trengthening and elevating their natural powers to a more vigorous exerci&s;e, and helping them again&s;t their manifold infirmities.</P>
<P>THIS much &s;eemeth to be included in what the &s;criptures declare concerning the Spirit's agency in this duty. Thus <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 26.&mdash;<HI>Likewi&s;e the Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infirmities; for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us, with groanings which cannot be utter|ed.</HI> "The Spirit of God," &s;aith Dr. <HI>Whitly,</HI> "is &s;aid to intercede for us, not as an Advocate or Media|tor betwixt God and us, that being the office of our Great High Prie&s;t; but as an <HI>Exciter</HI> or <HI>Director</HI> of us in our addre&s;&s;es to God, to render them, for matter, according to the will of God; and, for <HI>manner,</HI>

<P>THIS is all that, on this head, is maintained by the reformed churches, who plead for free prayer.</P>
<P>YOU alledge, Sir<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, p. <HI>53.</HI></NOTE>, that "the only in&s;piration pro|mi&s;ed in &s;cripture, that is nece&s;&s;ary, or that can be u&s;e|ful, is, that the Holy Spirit will in&s;pire the hearts of the faithful with <HI>affections</HI> proper for this important duty; &s;uch as &s;hame and &s;orrow in confe&s;&s;ion, an humble Chri&s;tian hope of obtaining what we a&s;k in our petiti|ons, gratitude and love in our Thank&s;givings, and &s;uch other affections as are &s;uitable to the &s;everal parts of Prayer." And I would only ob&s;erve upon it, that he who is ble&s;&s;ed with the frame for praying, and who&s;e affections are, in this manner, enlivened and quicken|ed, will not want a form. Upon this account (as <HI>a Spirit of Grace and Supplication</HI>) the Holy Gho&s;t is promi&s;ed to the Church.</P>
<P>So <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 6.&mdash;<HI>Becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the &s;pirit of his Son into your hearts, crying</HI> abba, <HI>Father.</HI> And <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 18.&mdash;<HI>Be filled with the &s;pirit, &s;peaking to your&s;elves in p&s;alms and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs, &s;inging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And Chap. vi. 18. &mdash;<HI>Praying always, with all prayer and &s;upplication, in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;everance, and &s;upplication for all &s;aints.</HI> So the Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude,</HI> in his general epi&s;tle, at the 20th <HI>ver&s;e.

<P>I WOULD not be thought to in&s;inuate that the Divine Spirit doth never afford his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the u&s;e of forms; I am only accounting for that di&s;re&s;pect which men are apt to &s;hew at the doctrine of the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the &s;pirit; and what I would be under&s;tood to mean is, that the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, with re&s;pect to the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, may be hoped for and experienced by all true <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to the end of the world.</P>
<P>AND here, let it be further ob&s;erved, that among all the extraordinary gifts of the &s;pirit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 28.</NOTE> prophe&s;ied by <HI>Jo|el,</HI> prayer is not mentioned; the words are, <HI>I will pour out my &s;pirit upon all fle&s;h, and your &s;ons and daughters &s;hall prophe&s;y, your old men &s;hall dream dreams, your young men &s;hall &s;ee vi&s;ions; and al&s;o upon the &s;ervants, and upon the handmaids, in the&s;e days will I pour out my Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. And in the &s;econd chapter of the <HI>Acts of the apo&s;tles,</HI> where this prophe&s;y is recited, as having its accompli&s;h|ment, prayer is not mentioned as any of tho&s;e extraor|dinary or miraculous powers which were then &s;hed
<PB N="42" REF="021967_0041_0FB659EB5B73FFF8">
forth by the influences of the &s;pirit. Neither is it &s;o mentioned in any part of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> except in one place<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Enumeration, <HI>1</HI> Cor. <HI>xii.</HI></NOTE>, where the gift of tongues, in that they were able to expre&s;s them&s;elves in languages they had never learned, &s;eems to be referred to, rather than the gift of prayer. If, then, it is not to be found among the extraordinary or miraculous, it mu&s;t belong to the ordinary or more common influences or operations of the &s;pirit; which were to extend to all the periods of the church, and to all the individuals which compo&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> my&s;tical body to the end of the world.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e &s;acred powers which are communicated to all &s;incere <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> though there is nothing <HI>new</HI> re|vealed to them, or what might amount to in&s;piration; yet the truths, the laws, and rules which were formerly revealed, are brought to their remembrance. And to this purpo&s;e are &s;everal of the promi&s;es relating to this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>paraclete,</HI> which we read of in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>IF, then, the continuance of the ordinary operations of the &s;pirit, is a thing promi&s;ed to, and to be expected by, the body of believing <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> to the end of time; the ridicule of in&s;piration mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tupid; perhaps it may be, in &s;ome degree, impious.</P>
<P>HAVING thus collected and faithfully repre&s;ented what the abettors of free prayer maintain, re&s;pecting the Holy Spirit and its influences, I &s;hall now proceed to obviate &s;uch other complaints as you have offered again&s;t this manner of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>"IN our congregations, you &s;ay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, p. <HI>24.</HI></NOTE>, the mouth runs before the mind, and &s;peaks, without giving us any op|portunity of thinking what we ought to &s;peak, and of|ten &s;ays things that we &s;hould certainly reject, and &s;ometimes offers petitions that we &s;hould ab&s;olutely abhor, had we time calmly to examine them: Our mouth leads us into the gro&s;s blunder of pre&s;enting our addre&s;&s;es to the Deity fir&s;t, and next judging whe|ther
<PB N="43" REF="021967_0042_0FB659EE90466990">
they be proper addre&s;&s;es, after they are offered, when we cannot mend what is wrong, or alter what is improper." You even make it a que&s;tion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, p. <HI>33</HI> and <HI>56.</HI></NOTE>, "Whether the laity can join at all in our public prayers; for we mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e that they go along with the mini&s;ter, of|fering every word as he utters it, or wait until he has fini&s;hed the &s;entence, and then examine it, and give their a&s;&s;ent."</P>
<P>To call this cavilling, rather than rea&s;oning, is not improper. If a mini&s;ter hath been regularly and duly called and appointed to his office, it is not doubted, except with the athei&s;tical herd, that he has a right, among other of his &s;acred mini&s;trations, to offer up prayers and &s;upplications, with thank&s;givings, in behalf of tho&s;e among whom he officiates. If this is the ca&s;e, then, that which is the mo&s;t natural and &s;criptu|ral manner of addre&s;s, hath been already &s;hewed.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that in this kind of publick wor&s;hip, "The mouth runs before the mind, and offers petitions which &s;hould be rejected," is, at the be&s;t, but a reflection, both on the laity and clergy, equally impolite and un|ju&s;t. To the laity, it denies that privilege in the wor|&s;hip of God, which is allowed them in all other affairs, relative to rea&s;onable beings. In our mutual conver|&s;ation and commerce, we find very few, except among tho&s;e who are void of under&s;tanding, but know per|fectly well where to yield their a&s;&s;ent, or di&s;&s;ent. Even the mo&s;t untutored ear can di&s;tingui&s;h between harmo|ny and di&s;cord; and it needs no proof, that the action of the mind is equally quick, whatever it be that de|mands its attention.</P>
<P>HOW would it hamper all conver&s;ation, and how &s;hould we be &s;traitened in the common offices of life, if we mu&s;t fir&s;t critically examine and nicely weigh every &s;en|tence that is &s;poken to us, before we could give a &s;uit|able an&s;wer? And how altogether vain and imperti|nent would all the labor of the pulpit, or &s;enate, or
<PB N="44" REF="021967_0043_0FB659EFE2B0DC00">
bar be, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition? If you do not under|&s;tand what is &s;poken to you, it is indeed to no pur|po&s;e to addre&s;s you: And this di&s;tingui&s;hing preroga|tive of &s;peech, whereby man is capable of communi|cating his thoughts, for the improvement or enter|tainment of his fellow creatures, is no more than an empty name. Nay, it is wor&s;e, if we admit your man|ner of rea&s;oning, Sir; for it would tend more to per|plex and to confound, than to enlighten and improve.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay, that I cannot join in public &s;ervice, or in offering up my prayers; with the &s;peaker, to the Almigh|ty, becau&s;e I mu&s;t either, in doing &s;o, go along with him in every word that he utters, or wait till he hath fini&s;hed, and then give my a&s;&s;ent to the whole; is rea|&s;oning much of the &s;ame &s;trength with that of the phi|lo&s;opher, who ridiculou&s;ly argued again&s;t motion, nearly in the &s;ame &s;tyle&mdash;For, &s;ays he, "If I move, it mu&s;t be either in the place where I am, or where I am not, but no body can move in the place where it is; for if it is there, it does not come out of it; nor in the place where it is not; for where it is not, it cannot act." A certain <HI>Cynic,</HI> gravely an&s;wered, by turning upon his heel, and walking to and fro through the apartment. The evidence of common &s;en&s;e, Sir, is again&s;t your argument.</P>
<P>SHOULD a mini&s;ter be told by one of his pari&s;hioners, "Sir, it is to no purpo&s;e for me to attend your public mini&s;trations; I am in no capacity to improve by them; you &s;peak, it is true, and it may be rationally enough; but if I am to receive benefit by your di&s;cour&s;es, my mind mu&s;t either go along with every word; or I mu&s;t examine every &s;entence after it is &s;poken. The fir&s;t would be acting too implicitly; the latter is not in my power; for before I have one &s;entence half exa|mined, you have well nigh fini&s;hed another, and the mind of man is not able to attend to &s;o many things at once."&mdash;Would this rea&s;oning be admitted? and can the Preacher plead to be heard, and in&s;i&s;t upon it that he may be under&s;tood, when delivering a me&s;&s;age
<PB N="45" REF="021967_0044_0FB659F75314C400">
from God to men, and not when offering up prayers for men to God? Or &s;hall the Laity be treated as rea|&s;onable beings in the one ca&s;e, and dive&s;ted of all ex|erci&s;e of rea&s;on and judgment, in the other? This mu&s;t be looked upon, by the unprejudiced, as very unfair.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to ob&s;erve further, upon this argument, that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in rea&s;oning again&s;t prayers in an unknown tongue, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv.) goes up|on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that when a man prays in a known tongue, in the public A&s;&s;embly, it may be to the edi|fication of the hearers. But according to your way of arguing, Sir, it would be to no purpo&s;e for him to pray in public at all, though in a known tongue, if it were not in a &s;tated pre&s;cribed form; &s;ince people could not be edified, or receive any benefit from it. And yet I believe the greate&s;t admirer of precompo&s;ed, pre&s;cribed forms, will &s;carce take upon him to affirm, that the prayers, the apo&s;tle there &s;peaks of, were of that kind.</P>
<P>AS for reflections upon tho&s;e who offer up our prayers, that their performances are "corrupted by the contrary petitions of contending parties; mixed with the whim&s;ical opinions and pernicious principles of libertines and enthu&s;ia&s;ts; rendered ob&s;cure and contemptible by the pedantry and affected learning of the younger, or by the weakne&s;&s;es of the mind and body of the older mini&s;ters; interlaid with ill-timed compliments to the great, with politicks and private piques and quarrels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, page <HI>39, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>"</P>
<P>I WILL venture to affirm, Sir, that tho&s;e who at|tend con&s;tantly upon public wor&s;hip, either in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> or among prote&s;tant <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> el&s;ewhere, know that the accu&s;ation advanced by you, as if the abu&s;es you mention were very frequent and even general, is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. And I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, you have &s;hewn too little regard to truth or decency to be be|lieved

upon your own word. But I &s;uppo&s;e you have been conver&s;ant in &s;uch authors as the <HI>Scotch Pre&s;byte|rian Eloquence,</HI> who&s;e calumnies and mi&s;repre&s;entations have been long &s;ince detected and expo&s;ed. There are thou&s;ands of witne&s;&s;es that the prayers offered up in the public a&s;&s;emblies are generally &s;uch as all <HI>chri&s;|tians</HI> may join in, &s;criptural, grave, and decent. But there is this remarkable difference between tho&s;e con|fined to Liturgies, and tho&s;e that are not &s;o; that, if a|ny thing be wrong in a free, unpre&s;cribed prayer, it is ea&s;ily amended, and the mi&s;chief cannot go very far, or be long continued; but in a public pre&s;cribed li|turgy, if either improper expre&s;&s;ions, or fal&s;e doctrines, or &s;uper&s;titious and idolatrous ways of wor&s;hip be in|troduced, they are bound down both upon Mini&s;ters and People, and continue perhaps, to future ages.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I think it proper to give the reader the following quotation from Doctor <HI>Bright,</HI> Dean of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> his treati&s;e on prayer.

And all the inconveniences that have ever ari&s;en from the abu&s;e of what you call <HI>extempore</HI> effu&s;ions, have not done the thou&s;andth part of the mi&s;chief in the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church, that the&s;e pre&s;cribed <HI>Liturgies</HI> have done.

<PB N="47" REF="021967_0046_0FB659FB3AEE3A38">
as well acquainted with this controver&s;y, as I pre&s;ume you would be thought to be, you would know that &s;e|veral improprieties have been ob&s;erved even in that public liturgy, which probably you mo&s;t admire. But I &s;pare the mention of them; for they that &s;o freely cen&s;ure others, have often very tender ears when it comes to their own ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary further to add, that there are various gifts and men of different parts, in all <HI>chri&s;ti|an</HI> communities; but it would be very cruel to load the &s;houlders of the innocent, with the faults or fail|ings of the guilty. Should this unrighteous manner of cen&s;uring and condemning <HI>all,</HI> for the weakne&s;&s;es of a <HI>few,</HI> take place, what church upon earth could &s;tand ac|quitted?</P>
<P>PETITIONS un&s;ea&s;onable or improper may by &s;ome be offered up; but it gives all the real friends of true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> liberty no &s;mall con&s;olation, that they are nei|ther nece&s;&s;itated by any pre&s;cribed form to addre&s;s them|&s;elves with impropriety, nor to prefer petitions quite contrary to the real &s;entiments of their hearts. They are neither hindered from what they &s;hould &s;ay, nor obliged, by the u&s;e of a defective form, to &s;peak what they &s;hould not &s;ay.</P>
<P>YOU alledge, Sir, that "all dangers might be pre|vented, and all deficiencies &s;upplied, by compo&s;ing and e&s;tabli&s;hing a pious form of prayer."&mdash;But if it be true, what hath been proved, that uncon&s;trained free prayer, is the mo&s;t natural, primitive and &s;criptural manner of addre&s;s to our Maker; then to pray by form, to avoid improprieties, is the greate&s;t blunder we could commit.</P>
<P>BESIDES, an unexceptionable form of human com|po&s;ure, hath never yet appeared in the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> church; and if any &s;uch thing &s;hould appear, it would be no &s;ecurity again&s;t blunders.

<P>BUT what is &s;till more con&s;iderable, the compo&s;ing, e&s;tabli&s;hing and impo&s;ing of a Form of Prayer, though more unexceptionable than hath hitherto appeared, would yet be an unju&s;tifiable infringement on the li|berty of <HI>chri&s;tians.</HI> There is not one text in all the Bible which impowers any man, or &s;et of men, to pre&s;cribe to me the very words which at all times, and in all circum&s;tances, I am to offer up to God. The apo&s;tles, though under the conduct of the Divine Spirit, never attempted &s;uch a thing, as hath been al|ready proved. They offered up their addre&s;&s;es, &s;uita|ble to their own conceptions. And &s;ince they have not pre&s;cribed to the church, in this in&s;tance, for un|in&s;pired men to do it, mu&s;t, I think, border upon pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, there neither is, nor can in truth be, any &s;uch thing as a perfect, invariable form of human compo&s;ure; if &s;uch a form, could it be devi&s;ed, would not prevent mi&s;takes; but above all, if the impo&s;ing of it, would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights of <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> there is no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be complied with: And the remedy you propo&s;e, Sir, would be of more dan|gerous con&s;equence than the evil complained of.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="021967_0048_0FB65A01DFAE88E0">IF it is alledged that, in the natural order of things, the congregation &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;atisfied, that the prayers to be offered in their name are proper and ju&s;t, and &s;uch as they can with freedom join in; otherwi&s;e they cannot pray in faith.&mdash;I an&s;wer, that we are required to hear, as well as to pray <HI>in faith;</HI> but according to this way of rea&s;oning, before a Sermon is delivered, it &s;hould always undergo the previous examination of tho&s;e that are to hear it, otherwi&s;e it cannot be profi|table.

<P>IN &s;upport of your argument you &s;ay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, page <HI>25.</HI></NOTE>, that "&s;hould the able&s;t member of the Hou&s;e of Commons propo&s;e to offer an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, in the name of the hou&s;e, without communicating it to the members, the impropriety would be immediately perceived."

<P>BUT I &s;hall put the ca&s;e a little &s;tronger, and more to the purpo&s;e: &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;et of men, who&s;e &s;kill in politics was very deep, &s;hould (without any authority from the &s;overeign for &s;o doing) take upon them to draw up a form or forms of addre&s;s, which &s;hould always be pre&s;ented to him in the &s;ame words, let the nature of government, or the exigencies of corporations and kingdoms vary as they plea&s;e; would not the impro|priety then be very &s;triking?

<P><PB N="50" REF="021967_0049_0FB65A05119B2808">YOU allow, Sir<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, page <HI>60.</HI></NOTE>, that in extraordinary ca&s;es, as <HI>in war, famine</HI> or <HI>pe&s;tilence,</HI> you might have added, in peace, health, and plenty, <HI>proper forms may be provided.</HI> And we &s;ee that in the church where forms are authorized, they are in &s;uch ca&s;es provided. Now, Sir, I be&s;eech you, be a righteous judge in this matter: What do the people in general, who, upon public Fa&s;t or Thank&s;|giving days, offer up their prayers or prai&s;es by form, know before-hand of what &s;hall be pre&s;cribed them? Some few perhaps in the <HI>Metropolis,</HI> where they are publi&s;hed, may have examined and con&s;idered, before they joined in them; but in country places, very few, but the mini&s;ters of pari&s;hes, know any thing of them, 'till they hear them when they are offered. Yet would it not be very uncharitable to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who are not previou&s;ly acquainted with them, or who have not maturely examined them, cannot with propriety join in &s;uch addre&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>IN &s;cripture we have frequent in&s;tances of public prayer; but that the people were unacquainted with them, was not, neither can it be, a prejudice to true de|votion. I mu&s;t beg leave once more to refer to the opi|nion of the worthy prelate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wilkins'</HI> Gift of Prayer, page <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> before mentioned, upon this head; "whereas 'tis commonly objected by &s;ome, that they cannot &s;o well join in an unknown form <HI>(&s;o he calls free prayer in re&s;pect of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e that hear it)</HI> with which they are not beforehand acquainted; I an&s;wer, that's an incon&s;iderable objection, and does oppo&s;e all kind of forms that are not publicly pre&s;cribed. As a man may, in his judgment, a&s;&s;ent unto any divine truth delivered in a &s;ermon which he never heard before, &s;o may he join in his affections to a holy de&s;ire in a pray|er he never heard before. If he, who is the mouth of the re&s;t, deliver, through imprudence, what we cannot approve of, God does not look upon it as our prayer,
<PB N="51" REF="021967_0050_0FB65A0EF18BAF70">
if our de&s;ires do not &s;ay AMEN to it."&mdash;The &s;en&s;e of this good man thus expre&s;&s;ed, if &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider|ed, Sir, will appear a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to many of your cavils.</P>
<P>I SHALL ob&s;erve further, that the matter of prayer is &s;o very plain, as not to &s;tand in need of that nice mi|nute enquiry which you &s;peak of. The humble <HI>Chri&s;|tian</HI> who has made it the bu&s;ine&s;s and delight of his &s;oul to attend public wor&s;hip, is not unacquainted with the proper order and method, as well as with the mat|ter of prayer. He knoweth, for in&s;tance, his &s;ins, wants, and mercies, as &s;oon as they are named; and though the&s;e things are put into words that he has not been accu&s;tomed to hear, yet this does not require any time to deliberate whether the confe&s;&s;ions, petitions, or thank&s;givings &s;uited to the common infirmities, de|&s;ires, and enjoyments of all, are proper to be offered up to the Almighty; he heartily joins in them, and reaps the benefit.</P>
<P>BUT his comfort and benefit are doubled, if he is &s;o happy as to hear his own particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e laid before the Almighty, which, perhaps, he had in confidence un|folded to his mini&s;ter, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting his prayers and tho&s;e of the church upon it; or which he, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to watch over the flock, had by &s;ome other means attained to the knowledge of. A privilege and plea&s;ure this, from which, by &s;tated forms, he mu&s;t have been for ever excluded.</P>
<P>YOUR argument is &s;till further urged by alledging<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, pages <HI>63, 64.</HI></NOTE>, that "if forms are unlawful, we are unlawfully bapti|zed, for that is done by a form.&mdash;We admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper in an unlawful manner, for we do it by a form, I mean the words of the fir&s;t in&s;titution: We are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed every Lord's day with an unlawful ble&s;|&s;ing; for one of the &s;olemn forms with which the a|po&s;tles conclude their epi&s;tles, is always u&s;ed upon that
<PB N="52" REF="021967_0051_0FB65A126A98FFB0">
occa&s;ion. Further, if forms of prayer be not accept|able to God, and an u&s;eful way of wor&s;hip for our&s;elves, we gro&s;sly offend every time we meet in church; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ing eighteen or twenty lines of a p&s;alm, but we offer &s;ome important petition by a form."</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that for all the&s;e matters we have divine authority and example. And no conclu&s;ion can be drawn from tho&s;e parts of our &s;olemn public &s;ervices, thus warranted, to enforce forms which are de&s;titute of &s;uch warrant or authority. Otherwi&s;e all the <HI>Ave Ma|rias,</HI> beads, and trumpery of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> may plead for admi&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ame footing, and with equal &s;hew of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>YOU alledge further<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;mith's Letter, page <HI>65.</HI></NOTE>, that "if our laity pray in the &s;ame words of the mini&s;ter, they are as much confined to a form, as any other people; for if the mini&s;ter &s;ays, <HI>Mo&s;t gracious God, forgive us our &s;ins, pre&s;erve us from danger, and provide for our nece&s;&s;ities:</HI> if the people re|peat the&s;e words, either in their minds, or with their mouths, or both; it is evident that they pray as much by a form, as if the prayer had been compo&s;ed a thou|&s;and years ago."&mdash;But, Sir, can that be a form to any, which is not &s;o in it&s;elf, nor to him that pronounces it? Let any man of common &s;en&s;e a&s;k him&s;elf, what is meant by a form? Whether it does not include in it the con&s;tant u&s;e of the &s;ame method, manner and words; and then this quibble of your's, will appear very vain and frivolous.</P>
<P>IF it be found that any mini&s;ter, as far as your cen|&s;ure reaches, &s;atisfies him&s;elf with a form, let it be re|membered that this form is not impo&s;ed upon other churches; and even, among tho&s;e where it is u&s;ed, it is &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;gu&s;t which tho&s;e human compo|&s;ures give, that are over and over repeated. This would not be endured at the Theatre, or at the Bar; and we have as good a right to look for variety, and to expect
<PB N="53" REF="021967_0052_0FB65A13F3EA40B0">
to meet with men of parts, among tho&s;e that are of &s;a|cred character. For my own part, I &s;hall hone&s;tly de|clare it as my private opinion, that &s;uch as are incapa|ble of u&s;ing free prayer, without apparent hazard of rendering it contemptible by their indecent manner of performing it, &s;hould not be admitted to the mini&s;try.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In this la&s;t part of his piece, the Black&s;mith has raved like his friend in Bedlam, and with equal phrenzy too, for <HI>50</HI> pages together without a pau&s;e, again&s;t the duty of prayer and all who attempt to perform it in public, or private; unle&s;s by a pre&s;cribed form. His invectives are avowedly pointed at the mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but they are really no le&s;s appli|cable to all <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters</HI> from the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and the whole body of the <HI>Reformed Church</HI> in all parts of the globe: for they all are guilty of the &s;ame unpardonable crime of praying to <HI>GOD extempore.</HI> In this an&s;wer it was thought proper to e&s;tabli&s;h the divine warrant for that kind of prayer. And it is now pre&s;umed that it is done in a manner that none of its opponents will ever be able to refute. All the tinkling din<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which our author makes upon this &s;ubject, is, therefore, to be con&s;idered only as idle &s;trokes of his hammer on his own anvil.

<P>His <HI>hue and cry</HI> about the dangers to which the people are expo&s;ed from public prayers offered without &s;ome pre&s;cribed form&mdash;&s;eeks all its &s;upport from the mean and malicious arts of &s;lander and abu&s;e:&mdash;by which he &s;truggles, with all his might, to hold up the whole body of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Clergy,</HI> as a banditti of abandoned and unprincipled known:&mdash;who&s;e chief qualifications are gro&s;s ignorance&mdash;impudent effrontry &mdash;over-weening pride&mdash;unhallowed pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;low malice&mdash;party rage&mdash;and mad enthu&s;ia&s;m. The poor man has been very unhappy in the choice of his &s;ubject: The character of that body of men is too long, and too publickly known, to be hurt by the impotent weapons of the Black&s;mith:&mdash;And to tho&s;e, who may yet be &s;trangers to the men, it will be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to his calumnies, to know, that in no church on earth, are greater pains taken to prepare man for the office of the Mini&s;try, than in the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> Be&s;ides the u&s;ual time &s;pent in the cour&s;e of philo&s;ophical Studies, &amp;c. in the Univer&s;ity,&mdash;the public rule requires &s;ix years to be employed in the <HI>Divinity-hall;</HI> under the in&s;truction of an approved public <HI>Profe&s;&s;or:</HI>&mdash;af|ter this, their cour&s;e of trials before the <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> can rarely be fini&s;hed in &s;ix months, before they can be licenced to preach.&mdash;Then do they continue to exerci&s;e their talents, only at the direction of the Pre&s;bytery, until they have received calls to &s;ettle in particular charges:&mdash;when that takes place, they have to pa&s;s as many trials before the Pre&s;bytery, as at their being fir&s;t licenced,&mdash;and after their ordination, they are &s;till liable to be called to ac|count for every thing complained of, either in their public performances, or private walk in life:&mdash;and a &s;ingle Pre&s;bytery can depo&s;e them from office, whenever found unworthy of it.</P>
<P>This is the church-government under which the Black&s;mith thinks the peo|ple are in more danger, than under that of <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf! with all the&s;e guards of the pulpit-door, he is &s;ure no man enters it, who is fit to be entru&s;ted to make one prayer in public! If he does, it is at the hazard of their &s;ouls for the people to join him! Nor can they be &s;afe by withholding their con&s;ent when they hear a wrong petition offered&mdash;&s;ince the Deity will be likely to mi&s;take it &s;till for theirs, and charge it to their account!
