<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pamphlet was publi&s;hed in London about four months ago. The infamous Letter of Paine &s;eems to have produced, in Great-Bri|tain, that degree of indignation and abhorrence, which the complica|ted crime of calumny, ingratitude, and perfidy, is calculated to ex|cite in every ju&s;t and generous mind. This &s;entiment of the Briti&s;h public, MR. KENNEDY has mo&s;t forcibly expre&s;&s;ed. He has traced the malignant traitor through the labyrinth of his nefarious career, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of his publications: he has brought forward many facts not generally known; has proved Paine to have been a hireling of France, <HI>from the clo&s;e of the American revolution;</HI> and has ex|hibited, in glaring colours, his abominable ingratitude to GENERAL WASHINGTON, who&s;e character, if it &s;tood in need of defence, has here &s;ound a zealous and able defender.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be a plea&s;ure to every good man, and particularly to every good American, to &s;ee that all men of talents, honour and hone&s;ty, even in foreign countries, feel them&s;elves intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving un|tarni&s;hed, the &s;ame of the MAN who is the pride of America; and, proportioned to this plea&s;ure, mu&s;t be the pain, the &s;hame, and the confu&s;ion of his unprincipled and viperous enemies.</P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO TOM PAINE's <HI>LETTER</HI> TO <HI>GENERAL</HI> WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>AMID the convul&s;ions, which have for &s;ome years unhappily agitated the European world&mdash; Amid the horrors of a Revolution, founded on animo&s;ities, hatreds, ma&s;&s;acres, and blood, in which the human character has been exhibited in all its deformity, no man has laboured more un|cea&s;ingly to unhinge the links of &s;ocial order&mdash;and to overturn Religion, Morality and Government, than the enthu&s;ia&s;tic, the depraved, the ungrateful Tom Paine.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having developed the inveterate malice, the &s;ub|tle cruelty of his character in a &s;eries of wild di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions and dangerous theories, all tending to the overthrow of general pro&s;perity and individual happine&s;s in every country, he has now con&s;um|mated his guilt, and given the mo&s;t evident proofs of the foulne&s;s of his heart, by &s;acrificing the la&s;t little remnant of imputed patrioti&s;m, to a faithle&s;s and cowardly attack on his early benefactor and friend.</P>
<P>We are not &s;urpri&s;ed, becau&s;e we di&s;cover plain|ly the immediate cau&s;e of the violent change that has dictated the declarations of di&s;content, and threats of ho&s;tility, which continue to fill the co|lumns
<PB N="4" REF="033947_0004_0FF9D090F6ECBEC8">of the French Journals, again&s;t the firm and prudent conduct of the American Congre&s;s, aided by their re&s;pectable Pre&s;ident.&mdash;It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the de&s;igning, ill-intentioned, ambitious leaders of faction in France, under the cloak of liberty, to practi&s;e all the arts of calumny, to mi&s;lead the peo|ple, and hurry them into the wilde&s;t mea&s;ures. That Tom Paine &s;hould &s;eize with avidity and with an activity, unfortunately in him combined with a mo&s;t malignant di&s;po&s;ition, every channel of in|vective, and abu&s;e and injury again&s;t the Briti&s;h Government, we cannot wonder at.&mdash;But that he &s;hould add to the black catalogue of his crimes, that of deep ingratitude, by aiming to &s;tab the &s;ame, to murder the character of the man that cheri&s;hed his political infancy, and brought him forward into public life, proves that the a&s;&s;umed garb of modern philo&s;ophy is but a &s;afer covering for the dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. An enemy of Britain by principles of rebellion, by habits of abu&s;e, by circum&s;tances of political elevation and private intere&s;t, we have &s;een him direct the whole force of his impo&s;ing talents, the &s;pecious trick of &s;mooth phra&s;eology, the cant of popular prejudices, to di&s;colour, to traduce, the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of government and to overthrow the con&s;titution of tho&s;e kingdoms.&mdash;But in his la&s;t performance, he far out-does his u&s;ual out-doings&mdash; he out-&s;trips depravity&mdash;and high o'er-leaping over|leaps all bounds,&mdash;faithful to his avowed princi|ples of anarchy and commotion, he boldly &s;oars to the la&s;t and greate&s;t of crimes, ingratitude, and
<PB N="5" REF="033947_0005_0FF9D02CDE0CD348">arraigns the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington for his per&s;ever|ing and virtuous attachment to the order, the pro&s;|perity of the American States.</P>
<P>In the phrenzy of Gallic zeal, he forgets that he fell a victim in his turn to the fury of faction; and that in de&s;pite of his labours for a &s;eries of years in the cau&s;e of revolutionary government, he was con&s;igned to a dungeon; and eventually re&s;cued from the guillotine, which carried off his fellow-actors on the great revolutionary theatre, after &s;trutting their hour on the bloody &s;tage, only by the generous interference of tho&s;e peaceful and humane Americans, whom he now loads with re|proach and obloquy, becau&s;e they will not &s;acrifice individual virtue, and rational wi&s;dom, to the in&s;o|lent dictation of French partizans, and dome&s;tic anarchi&s;ts.</P>
<P>One would have thought that the &s;ituation of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uffering, into which Paine was hur|ried, among the other revolutionary heroes of his day, and his narrow e&s;cape from the gripe of the guillotine, &s;hould have checked the <HI>cacoethos &s;cri|bendi,</HI> and awed him from meddling further in political affairs. But it &s;eems that confinement tended only to &s;harpen the edge of calumny, and to point more keenly the &s;hafts of &s;lander again&s;t all that men are taught to re&s;pect in &s;ociety&mdash;Mo|rality and Religion. The moment of his delive|rance from pri&s;on, was like the opening of Pan|dora's box, marked by the i&s;&s;uing forth of a more pe&s;tilential vapour than what he had before &s;ent
<PB N="6" REF="033947_0006_0FF9D095E0FB2D20">into the world. Religion, that great cement and bond of public order&mdash;the gracious harbinger of peace and happine&s;s to mankind, became the ob|ject of his &s;currillity and ridicule. Maxims, arrayed in all the fal&s;e colourings and tin&s;el glare of &s;ubtle attraction, were propagated and diligently &s;pread abroad, to catch the prejudices of the unthinking and ignorant, as well as to gratify the conceits and vanity of the di&s;&s;olute and profane.</P>
<P>Happily, in this bloated publication, his views have failed; his itch of &s;cribbling, his mania of innovation, outran di&s;cretion; and the mo&s;t zea|lous advocates after reform, the mo&s;t furious zea|lots for his Rights of Man, were &s;orely chagrined, vexed, di&s;gu&s;ted, and irritated, that he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon di&s;cover the latitude of their intentions, and expo&s;e a &s;y&s;tem, menacing with ab&s;olute de&s;truc|tion, the true ba&s;is of liberty and good govern|ment. They confe&s;&s;ed that Mr. Paine mi&s;took the Briti&s;h character, when he u&s;hered in, with all the pomp of laboured talent and detailed &s;ubtlety, tho&s;e athei&s;tical tenets which make the Chri&s;tian revolt from the book and from the man, with hone&s;t in|dignation: The political reformers, who looked upon him before as their &s;ure&s;t champion, felt how much the public opinion would in&s;tantly turn again&s;t the author of tho&s;e atrocious &s;y&s;tems which fill the humane and Chri&s;tian heart with terror and di&s;may.</P>
<P>Every man attached to the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation &s;aw clearly that there was &s;ome latent de&s;ign, &s;ome
<PB N="7" REF="033947_0007_0FF9D033D472DD00">&s;ecret purpo&s;e, &s;ome &s;oul intention of public mi&s;|chief, in an open attack upon religion; becau&s;e every thinking man is fully convinced that an at|tempt to overthrow religious principles, evinces a di&s;po&s;ition ho&s;tile to all re&s;traints of law and &s;ocial order, and inimical to that &s;alutary doctrine, which inculcates peace on earth, and good-will among men.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine, in the full career of vanity, and ela|ted by the &s;upport his former o&s;tentatious produc|tions had met with, from the agitators of &s;edition, proudly imagined that public opinion would be al|ways at his command; that a people deluded for a while by the &s;ophi&s;try, the &s;pecious embelli&s;h|ments of fanta&s;tic novelty, and prepared by the in|trigue of itinerant declaimers and active partizans, would embrace, with ardour, any &s;y&s;tem promul|gated by him, however incon&s;i&s;tent or di&s;ea&s;ed.&mdash; He flattered him&s;elf that the momentary celebrity of the Rights of Man, would e&s;tabli&s;h his Age of Rea&s;on; and the name of Tom Paine triumph over the mild doctrines of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>In his &s;trenuous efforts to promote irreligion and immorality, and to inculcate a contempt of the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, he takes care to call up the pre|judices of the vulgar, by levelling the artillery of his &s;lander again&s;t the Clergy: Judging with acute cunning, that to relax and undermine the ob&s;er|vances and ties of religion, the be&s;t method is to begin by le&s;&s;ening that awe and re&s;pect, which we
<PB N="8" REF="033947_0008_0FF9D036E9200F98">ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">tertain for a body of men, who are paticularly appointed to in&s;truct us in the ways of true piety and virtue, and who, in general, de|&s;erve from us the utmo&s;t regard.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that men often pervert ta|lents to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Ingeniis male u&s;i&mdash;</L>
<L>et facundi malo publico.</L>

<P>They labour to darken and corrupt the minds of others, with unremitting earne&s;tne&s;s; they &s;educe the multitude to their views by &s;hattering their pa&s;|&s;ions &mdash;by dre&s;&s;ing up fal&s;ehood in the colours of truth, and vice in the garb of virtue. The wi&s;e and good may look with contempt and indigna|tion on the endeavours of &s;uch men; but, unhap|pily, they are too apt to gain credit and e&s;tima|tion with the greater number.</P>
<P>Happily for mankind, the Age of Rea&s;on be|came the antidote to the poi&s;on of the Rights of Man. Paine's mo&s;t zealous advocates were cover|ed with &s;hame and mortification at the total di&s;re|gard of religious character and public opinion, in their favourite hero of liberty.&mdash;The democratic &s;cribes were obliged to abandon his defence for the time, and even to confe&s;s the folly, the wick|edne&s;s of his attack upon religion.&mdash;While, on the other hand, all men of &s;ober reflexion &s;aw in that publication the extreme licention&s;ne&s;s over atten|dant on the extreme freedom of the pre&s;s; where opinions are hazarded, and doctrines introduced,
<PB N="9" REF="033947_0009_0FF9CFC252A4E360">&s;ubver&s;ive of all tho&s;e relative duties, which unite Men in Society.</P>
<P>It is a maxim, founded on truth, that Religion is the firme&s;t foundation of honour and true hap|pine&s;s in every &s;tate; and the mo&s;t permanent pil|lar and &s;tronge&s;t &s;upport in every form of govern|ment. A cur&s;ory view of the annals of former ages will &s;ufficiently convince us, that every State and Kingdom flouri&s;hed or decayed, were happy or convul&s;ed, in proportion as they were more or le&s;s religious. The rea&s;on is plain. Individuals will certainly be puni&s;hed or rewarded in another life according to their actions here&mdash;but public communities and &s;tates, as &s;uch, can only be re|warded or puni&s;hed in this world; and, therefore, national wickedne&s;s mu&s;t ever expect public and national puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This &s;hould be a le&s;&s;on to all who are placed in high &s;tations, and fill the feat of power, to exhibit the brighte&s;t examples of truth and ju&s;tice, of ho|nour and religion. The examples of the great will induce more to tread the paths of virtue than the in&s;tructions of the mo&s;t eloquent preacher, or the mo&s;t fini&s;hed e&s;&s;ays of the fine&s;t writer.</P>
<P>In our own mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, and in his Royal Confort, we behold bright cramples of moral excellence and virtuous life. We glory in a monarch who&s;e &s;ole aim and &s;tudy is to e&s;tabli&s;h law and religion, in their full and offential force, again&s;t a tide of innovadon and danger to public happine&s;s. And &s;urely, we may truly pronounce
<PB N="10" REF="033947_0010_0FF9D040B28BB668">that for &s;uch gracious purpo&s;es, "the powers that be, are ordained of God."&mdash;When power and virtue are thus united for the public good, what can be more ju&s;t and beneficial?</P>
<P>The conduct, the &s;peeches, the letters of Gene|ral Wa&s;hington, have ever manife&s;ted a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of religion and virtue.&mdash;That great Man has ever evinced his conviction of this truth&mdash;viz.</P>
<P>We may pain the beauties of virtue and reli|gion in the mo&s;t alluring colours; but it is exam|ple alone that mu&s;t prevail over the multitude, and teach the ignorant and thoughtle&s;s, wi&s;dom. We mu&s;t practically adore our Creator, love our fel|low-creatures, and obey the dictates of con&s;cience, that faithful monitor, placed by Omnipotence in the human brea&s;t. We profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity&mdash;be|cau&s;e in it we find every precept nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e and elevate human nature to perfection; and, at the &s;ame time, the plea&s;ing a&s;&s;urance of an atone|ment and propitiation for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and imperfections of the human race. The more this religion is examined, the more we are convinced of its divine original: Time, the unerring touch|&s;tone of truth, confirms its verity and proclaims its power.</P>
<P>If there is any foundation in the above ob&s;erva|tions,</P>
<P>"And that there is, all Nature &s;peaks aloud"&mdash; How dreadful mu&s;t be the terrors of Tom Paine, if con&s;cience is ever awakened in &s;uch brea&s;ts? How fearful the repre&s;entation of the wide and
<PB N="11" REF="033947_0011_0FF9D04BE6EAC8A8">horrible wa&s;te, which his guilty mind would &s;pread among mankind&mdash;as the immediate con&s;equence of his infernal Gallic creed&mdash;<HI>Death is an eternal &s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>While we reprobate and dete&s;t the impious &s;y&s;|tems promulgated in the Age of Rea&s;on; while we con&s;ign to merited contempt its daring author, we mu&s;t not omit paying the ju&s;t tribute of acknow|ledgement to the abilities of a prelate, who has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> well de&s;erved of mankind by his clear argu|mentative and highly impre&s;&s;ive refutation of the impious doctrines of the maniac Paine. With great per&s;picuity, preci&s;ion, and an eminent di&s;play of learning, the right reverend divine improves the under&s;tanding of the reader, corrects the aber|rations of di&s;ordered imagination, and in the mo&s;t convincing manner unfolds the &s;acred truths of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation. With an even flow of &s;trong rea&s;oning and good humour, he tempers &s;everity of reprehen&s;ion, by an animated earne&s;t|ne&s;s to recal the Athei&s;t from the impiety of his ways; and leads the reader &s;miling and plea&s;ed over the rocks and &s;ands of irreligion, into the paths of knowledge, virtue, law and government.</P>
<P>But to return to the immediate &s;ubject of his let|ter. Mr. Paine, with the u&s;ual good intention towards the Briti&s;h government and Briti&s;h admi|ni&s;tration, recurs in many pages to his old habits of abu&s;e of our con&s;titution&mdash;he vomits up his gall
<PB N="12" REF="033947_0012_0FF9D09C80E704A0">on that &s;ubject with drunken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a matter of fact, that for many months pa&s;t, Tom Paine has totally given him&s;elf up to habits of drunkenne&s;s and bla&s;phemy&mdash;like all lawle&s;s and profligate &s;pirits, to blunt the avenging &s;tings of remor&s;e, he has delivered him&s;elf over to &s;trong libations of pure cogniac, and is daily plunged in intoxi|cation and &s;tupor&mdash;Such is ever the end of the di&s;&s;olute and wicked &s;coffers of God and his holy laws.</NOTE> eructation, and gives us large do&s;es of his former libellous animadver|&s;ions on our happy combination of king, lords, and commons&mdash;while writing profe&s;&s;edly to Gene|ral Wa&s;hington, he allows him&s;elf to be tran&s;por|ted into a long &s;train of invective, and re-a&s;&s;erts, with his u&s;ual vehemence of aggravating &s;tile, that every thing is &s;lavery which re&s;trains men in any part of their freedom: but we &s;ee, by too near an in&s;tance, what is to be gained by this doctrine&mdash;by an intemperate uncontroulable lu&s;t of domi|nion, the French have depopulated their own once-fertile and happy provinces, &s;pread deva&s;ta|tion over the neighbouring countries; and their pre&s;ent attempts aim to impart to our pro&s;perous country the fraternizing law of de&s;olation and ma&s;&s;acre. Nor does the melancholy experience they have had in attempting an inva&s;ion of Ire|land, deter them from holding out &s;imilar threats again&s;t the &s;hores of Britain, throughout our whole line of coa&s;t.</P>
<P>May I a&s;k, what are the cau&s;es that thus give the temptation to our furious Gallic neighbours to
<PB N="13" REF="033947_0013_0FF9D0536215BD10">attempt to de&s;troy us?&mdash;It is in them then a vile jealou&s;y of our national pro&s;perity, of our dome&s;|tic comforts, of our commercial enterpri&s;e, of our con&s;titution, and of our laws. Without a regula|ted &s;y&s;tem of government, men cannot enjoy what belongs to each in particular; nor can a nation be &s;ecure, or pre&s;erve it&s;elf in general. While &s;ubjects live in a competent &s;hare of freedom, it is &s;urely unnatural to have public harmony and &s;ymmetry of law interrupted by means that were originally made u&s;e of to attain it. In de&s;pite of the male|dictory comments of maddened Paine, while our cities are populous, thriving and great, our com|merce exten&s;ive and flouri&s;hing, our con&s;titution envied and admired, I am not a&s;hamed to own my low-&s;pirited frailty in preferring &s;uch a model of government as affords rea&s;onable enjoyment to a free people, before that by which empire is to be founded at home in blood, and extended abroad by a profu&s;ion of millions of lives.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, however, men may differ on various political que&s;tions, there is an argument in this ca&s;e which precludes any an&s;wer&mdash;it is this&mdash;we could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t under the de&s;poti&s;m of one, or the tyranny of many. As a great writer ob&s;erves, we are to con&s;ider that we are a very little &s;pot in the map of the world, and make a very great figure only by trade, which is the creature of li|berty. One de&s;troyed, the other falls to the ground
<PB N="14" REF="033947_0014_0FF9B983BB36B100">by a natural con&s;equence that will not admit a di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>If we would be mea&s;ured &s;olely by our acres, we are a poor incon&s;iderable people: we are exalted above our natural bounds by our good government and excellent laws.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be no more a people, nor could England longer keep its name, commerce and wealth, from the moment that the revolutionary movements of innovation and anarchy took place. The vital &s;trength that &s;upports us being with|drawn, we &s;hould be no more than the carca&s;e of a nation, with no better &s;ecurity than that of pil|lage and murder: and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon no other terms than the unbridled ferocity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fac|tions, alternately rioting in blood. In the judgment, therefore, of moderate men, there is &s;uch a &s;hort deci&s;ion to be made on
this &s;ubject, that in rela|tion to tho&s;e kingdoms, and the &s;ame will hold good of the American States, any reform of Gal|lic complexion is as dangerous a thing to be wi&s;hed, as I hope is will be impo&s;&s;ible to be attained&mdash;Eng|land is the natural ally of America.</P>
<P>The animo&s;ities of the American revolution having long &s;ince &s;ub&s;ided, and melted into a cur|rent of philanthropy, mutual good will and com|mercial intercour&s;e; the bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> of old attachment, I will &s;ay, of old relation&s;hip living happily reno|vated by the late commercial treaty, and cemented

<P>The rattle&s;nake, compared with Tom Paine, is an innocent animal. The rattle&s;nake will ba&s;k in &s;un&s;hine of its native fields&mdash;&s;pread its volumi|nous body out at length to the genial heat&mdash;and man, woman and child may pa&s;s uninjured by. It is only when trodden upon or attacked by &s;cythe, &s;ickle or &s;tick, that it is rou&s;ed to rage, to coil up its variety of folds, to hi&s;s horror, and &s;ound its multitudinuous rattles, and to prepare for defence, in con&s;equence of offence&mdash;the bite is poi&s;on, the poi&s;on is death. Follow up the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Tom Paine is a pe&s;t in &s;ociety. His fir&s;t political efforts were directed again&s;t the country that gave him birth. With more acrimony of invective, with more eagerne&s;s of fiery zeal than the public men in America approved, he attacked the monarchy, the con&s;titution of England; and reviled the pru|dent caution of tho&s;e &s;tates, that wi&s;hed to open a channel of accommodation and reconciliation with Britain, before a formal and final &s;eparation was proclaimed. After the declaration of indepen|dence, I forbear to comment on his writings; he avowed him&s;elf a renegado from Briti&s;h govern|ment, 
<PB N="16" REF="033947_0016_0FF9D0A54DC3B650">and boa&s;ted his citizen&s;hip in America. But why, after the peace; why, after a full acknow|ledgment of the independence of America&mdash;after a commencement was made of mutual confidence, harmony, and commerce, why &s;till cheri&s;h a latent poi&s;on, an unforgiving enmity towards the country that gave him birth? Nay, more; why relinqui&s;h the adopted &s;oil of liberty, and return to Europe to di&s;turb the peace, the government of a country he had abjured? Why &s;it down, in &s;ullen &s;ilent di&s;affection, to &s;pread his pe&s;tilential vapours throughout Britain; and to &s;ap the foundation of all law, human and divine? Why continue the de&s;tructive tenor of his evil ways, to point the dagger of malevolence at the brea&s;t of his former patron, benefactor, and friend, and aim to wound the un&s;ullied, unruffled bo&s;om of a Wa&s;hington?

<P>Here I beg leave to call the reader's attention to a circum&s;tance that tends &s;trongly to elucidate and explain this &s;ettled, &s;ubtle, enthu&s;ia&s;tic ran|cour in this man-&s;nake, again&s;t general Wa&s;hing|ton, and the other elevated characters of America, again&s;t whom he largely deals out his frothy pages of abu&s;e.

<PB N="17" REF="033947_0017_0FF9B92D88527670">time, le&s;s worthy of elucidation. I appeal to the recollection of the American gentlemen now in London; I appeal to the people of Philadelphia, and New-York, who particularly witne&s;&s;ed the tran&s;action; I appeal to Tom Paine him&s;elf; be|cau&s;e the retro&s;pect mu&s;t harrow up his &s;oul to a horrific &s;en&s;e of his re&s;tle&s;s, uncea&s;ing animo&s;ity, to all that is Briti&s;h, to all that borders on modera|tion, loyalty, humanity, and honour.</P>
<P>After the ratification of the treaty of indepen|dence and peace with America; after the evacua|tion of the American States by the Briti&s;h troops, in the lap&s;e of a few months, the memory of the pa&s;t di&s;a&s;ters and calamities of war began to &s;often down. Men of the fir&s;t abilities, both in the Ame|rican field and in the American cabinet, &s;oon de&s;|cried the crooked policy, the haughty intent of France, by a magi&s;terial boa&s;t of their aid and con|&s;equence, to bow down the American &s;pirit to a &s;ervile dependence on French councils and French friend&s;hip, by fettering the intercour&s;e with Great Britain. For this purpo&s;e, French adventurers poured in on all quarters: Tom Paine was em|ployed by French agents to brandi&s;h his goo&s;e|quill, in order to cheri&s;h the memory of pa&s;t &s;cenes of battle and deva&s;tation, and to plant an incura|ble hatred between the two countries. With his u&s;ual alacrity in the cau&s;e of di&s;cord and di&s;union, this dark con&s;pirator again&s;t the peace of mankind,
<PB N="18" REF="033947_0018_0FF9D0AD4537D4A8">began his virulent attacks in the public papers, un|der an <HI>old</HI> Roman name: ob&s;tinate and vain of his pen, he began by loading with foul reproach of dangerous de&s;igns, tho&s;e who had remained at their homes, and who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be at|tached, during the war, to the Briti&s;h cau&s;e.

<P>But where was the man to be found to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t this popular writer? It required a prudent &s;kill to wield the pen at &s;uch a cri&s;is; to re&s;cue, from reproach and prejudices, an indu&s;tri|ous body of men, who had remained quietly at their homes to e&s;cape the &s;torm of war,&mdash;to undertake the cau&s;e of injured innocence, it required the mo&s;t delicate expre&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t benevolent exertion of philanthropy. That man appeared; and, un|der a Roman &s;ignature, with manly firmne&s;s, but, in temperate language and &s;ound argument, con|troverted the violent invectives of Mr. Paine, re|butted the foul accu&s;ations of intrigue and danger from Briti&s;h loyali&s;ts, or Briti&s;h intercour&s;e; and, by pointing out the community of commercial in|tere&s;ts, &s;hewing the utility of an exten&s;ive trade with Briti&s;h merchants, who&s;e &s;olid capitals, good faith, and exten&s;ive manufactures, were the &s;u|re&s;t earne&s;t of future and permanent pro&s;perity to young America, he gradually &s;moothed and har|monized the public mind, and levelled to the ground the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of prejudice and hatred, conjured up by the emi&s;&s;aries of France&mdash;with Tom Paine at their head.</P>

<P>It is needle&s;s to mention the name of this great man&mdash;the picture I have drawn points him out &s;uf|ficiently&mdash;he &s;erved in the field by the &s;ide of Wa&s;hington&mdash;He has lent his a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand and coun&s;el to the virtuous Pre&s;ident of the States from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent enviable Con&s;titu|tion:

<P>May I here be allowed a few words on our re|lative condition.</P>
<P>When we contemplate our real &s;ituation, the fertility of our &s;oil, the con&s;titution of our go|vernment, and the many other ble&s;&s;ings peculiar to our&s;elves, we have rea&s;on to thank Heaven that we were born in &s;o happy a country. But, un|happily, the re&s;tle&s;s mind of man always wanders abroad, &s;eeking &s;ome fanciful of di&s;tant &s;cene of
<PB N="22" REF="033947_0022_0FF9D0C8524830E8">felicity, while the happine&s;s in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is faint|ly enjoyed or lo&s;t in in&s;en&s;ibility, or di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>In de&s;pite of the high colourings, and fal&s;e im|po&s;ing lu&s;tre of our modern reformers, who&s;e de|clamatory pages are hurried through the chemical laboratory of multitudinous editions, to catch the gape, and &s;tare of the vulgar, when we &s;it down di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to compare our condition with that of mo&s;t other countries of Europe, the compari&s;on ought to in&s;ire us with gratitude to our rulers, with fortitude and re&s;olute union to meet the nece&s;&s;ary burdens, for the more firm enjoyment of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity and family com|forts. In mo&s;t parts of France, and throughout the countries they have invaded, we &s;ee numerous provinces groaning under the weight of French tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; and, as an increa&s;e of re|volutionary wretchedne&s;s, we behold the capital expo&s;ed to all the calamities of latent con&s;piracies:&mdash;We &s;ee the inhabitants of the different great ci|ties plundered by alternate depredators, or &s;laugh|tered with wanton cruelty.

<P>Let me offer a word of advice to tho&s;e &s;plendid reformers, the mendacious treachery of who&s;e la|boured writings is but too &s;ucce&s;sful a bait to an unthinking and too credulous multitude. They know well that the pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart hold clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with each other; and the progre&s;s from one violent affection to another is often rapid and involuntary. If we give way to habits of approbation&mdash;to expre&s;&s;ions of admira|tion of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of pro&s;cription and murder, which follow Revolutionary Government, our ap|plau&s;e will operate gradually, &s;o forcibly on our minds, that we imbibe the &s;ame cruel and unrelent|ing &s;entiments: while we are palliating the profli|gate
<PB N="24" REF="033947_0024_0FF9D0D9C6FE7760">vices, the wicked intrigues, the bloody plots of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive factions in France, and urging &s;imi|lar horrors among our&s;elves, under the &s;oft <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Reform, we are hardening our minds to the &s;ame &s;avage and barbarous &s;y&s;tems; and proving to the world, that for the accompli&s;hment of pri|vate ambition and power, we would hazard the perils of in&s;urrection, rebellion, and their acco|mitant horrors.</P>
<P>But, however ob&s;tinately a band of pretended patriots may attempt to palliate the motives of hor|rid a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and to per&s;uade the world, that the perpetrators of &s;uch foul crimes were moved by ju&s;t principles of liberty, to take tho&s;e bloody methods of avenging their wrongs:&mdash;However perver&s;ely our p&mdash;y declaimers may endeavour, under colour of reform, to ju&s;tify their unnatural predilection and propen&s;ity for Gallic Revolution, I tru&s;t they never will be able &s;o far to impo&s;e upon the under&s;tanding and virtue of &s;en&s;ible and re|flecting Britons.</P>
<P>The la&s;t revolutionary writer, who&s;e editions have been largely multiplied by magic proce&s;s, to dazzle the public eye, is the grand &s;upporter of the chief of his party, and contends, by a mocke|ry of argument, as in&s;ulting to the good &s;en&s;e of Engli&s;hmen, as it is injurious to truth and fact, that Mr. Fox alone can admini&s;ter the Govern|ment at this time with effect. That is, the doc|trine of faction &s;upports it&s;elf now, as it has always done, on the &s;uppo&s;ed incapacity of the pre&s;ent

<P>However enormous and de&s;tructive the publica|tions, ru&s;hing from the pen of Tom Paine, one would imagine, that he wanted to out-do him&s;elf in this atrocious Letter&mdash;It would in fact &s;eem, that after many years labours happily un&s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t Britain, he thought he &s;hould more ea&s;ily obtain the palm, the apex of infamy, by means equally &s;hocking to honour and gratitude, as in|con&s;i&s;tent with truth and decency. What mu&s;t be our opinion of the pre&s;umption of an individual, known only by his crimes, who arrogantly arraigns the man to whom Europe has long &s;ince conceded the merit of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, the wreathe of mi|litary merit, obtained by the exertion of abilities, and by the noble&s;t in&s;tances of prudential caution and firmne&s;s. With petulant affection of military &s;kill and critici&s;m, this little <HI>Ingrate</HI> dares to mea|&s;ure the campaigns of the American war, and to controvert tho&s;e brilliant and di&s;tingui&s;hed traits of heroi&s;m, which Briti&s;h generals of long experi|ence,
<PB N="32" REF="033947_0032_0FF9D11514AB2728">acknowledged with a kind of terri&s;ic appro|bation, and which the great <HI>Frederic,</HI> who knew how to appreciate military exploits, confe&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize and admiration&mdash;If the old hero of Pru&s;|&s;ia expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch e&s;timation for the commander, and glowed with love to the man;&mdash;If all Europe confe&s;&s;ed the &s;uperiority of American enterprize and exertion, amid a thou&s;and difficulties: If Wa&s;hington e&s;tabli&s;hed a character that can ne|ver die, or be ob&s;cured by the vapour of &s;lander; If, by the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate endearments and ten|derne&s;s for his troops, in want of nece&s;&s;ary cloath|ing, &s;tockings, and &s;hoes, he was able to reconcile them to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to animate them in a virtu|ous per&s;everance in the cau&s;e of their country: if his comprehen&s;ive mind was able to defeat the be&s;t con&s;erted plans of his adver&s;aries in the field: If his wi&s;dom, fertile in expedients, was capable of forming the va&s;t project of capturing a whole ar|my: If, by a variety of &s;kilful manoeuvres, invio|lable &s;ecrecy, he concealed the magnitude of the undertaking, till the various combinations of ar|tillery, of ve&s;&s;els, and provi&s;ions, were prepared to carry his plan into execution, by the mo&s;t rapid and unexpected movements:&mdash;If &s;uch military operations place a general in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed point of view, &s;urely all men mu&s;t admire the cou|rage and conduct of the American commander in chief.</P>
<P>Who, that reads the valedictory addre&s;&s;es of Gen. Wa&s;hington to the people of America, can doubt the probity and excellence of the heart that dictated
<PB N="33" REF="033947_0033_0FF9D11CAD430558">&s;uch humane and benevolent &s;entiments? Every Briton that in the war felt the courage of the hand that wrote it; every man that heard of the at|chievements of a Wa&s;hington, mu&s;t read, with a generous concern and regret, the farewel addre&s;s of an illu&s;trious chief magi&s;trate; who, after the labours of a difficult and &s;ucce&s;sful war; after the &s;everities of long and dangerous campaigns, for|&s;ook the bed of ea&s;e and dome&s;tic comfort, of whom the Americans may, with exultation, pronounce, in the words of Seneca&mdash;
<Q>Unus cunctando, nobis re&s;tituit rem,</Q>
to &s;ecure to his country the happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and permanency of an e&s;tabli&s;hed government of com|merce, internal harmony, and federal union.&mdash; Thus great and glorious to the end of his political career, how much mu&s;t the grateful citizens of America, how much mu&s;t po&s;terity, admire his long laborious &s;ervices, and un&s;ullied virtue; and, to crown all, the &s;teady attachment of his &s;oul to his country's welfare, by his manly oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e factious demagogues, who would ri&s;k nation|al happine&s;s for the accompli&s;hment of their de&s;|tructive and flagitious de&s;igns in favour of Gallic re|publicani&s;m. The valedictory addre&s;s of the imma|culate Wa&s;hington, has made a &s;erious and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the public mind in this country, as in America. In that hone&s;t plain production, we di&s;|cover the abilities of the con&s;ummate &s;tate&s;man, the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t legi&s;lator, the affectionate advice of the parent, anxious for the welfare of his
<PB N="34" REF="033947_0034_0FF9B9BC27E87610">children, and concerned for the aberrations and indi&s;cretions of a part of his family.&mdash;We di&s;cover the tender &s;ympathy of a mind anxious and ea|ger at an eventful cri&s;is, to perform the utmo&s;t po&s;|&s;ible &s;ervice to his country.&mdash;We admire that emi|nent di&s;play of political knowledge, in which he offers, with energy and freedom, his la&s;t advice towards pre&s;erving that vigorous union and form of government, under which the country had pro&s;|pered in wealth and commerce, the reins of which he was about to re&s;ign into other hands.&mdash;He takes an ample &s;urvey of the relative &s;ituation of America and Europe, and delineates the beauties and defects of the &s;everal component parts of the &s;everal go|vernments.&mdash;He points out, with hone&s;t zeal and firmne&s;s, the &s;helves and rocks of di&s;union, on which tho&s;e who have been at the helm of a neigh|bouring revolution have ran; and, with glowing pencil, paints the advantages of a political and commercial connection with England, as the palla|dium of peace, liberty, and pro&s;perity to America.</P>
<P>It is an agreeable entertainment and con&s;olation for the great and comprehen&s;ive mind of a Wa&s;h|ington, to look to the work of his hands.&mdash;He has rai&s;ed an infant empire; he has brought numerous and di&s;cordant colonial intere&s;ts into union and foederal harmony;&mdash;he has &s;tood at the helm, till their defence has been compleated again&s;t all the inclemencies and &s;torms which agitate the Europe|an continent;&mdash;he has witne&s;&s;ed the rapid progre&s;s of improvement and &s;een the empire great in agri|culture,
<PB N="35" REF="033947_0035_0FF9D124B7D8B508">flouri&s;hing in commerce, and directed by the well-regulated policy of peace with all the world. It is &s;urely a rich repa&s;t for the mind of the wi&s;e and good to contemplate &s;uch a picture&mdash;here we can furni&s;h our minds with true ideas of beau|ty and deformity, when we &s;ee one man thus great|ly contributing to the happine&s;s of the whole, by a conduct formed on prineiples of wi&s;dom and virtue, which never fail to render individuals, as well as communities, happy and pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>And why is it that Mr. Paine emits his bile in &s;uch quantity, and labours to a&s;&s;ail the character and conduct of one of the worthie&s;t and be&s;t of men?</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e the great and revered Wa&s;hington wi&s;hes to avert the pernicious and pe&s;tilential in|fluence of Gallic incendiaries from the peaceful &s;hores of America.&mdash;It is, becau&s;e he has had di&s;|cernment to di&s;cover that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and violence in the Councils of France, which would e&s;tabli&s;h its power on the ruins, and at the expen&s;e of others; that would &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of its neare&s;t allies to public plunder and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e he &s;ees in the conduct of the French leaders, an encouragement of anarchy in other &s;tates, and a de&s;ire of revolutionizing other Gover|ments, as ambition and avarice point the way.&mdash; It is becau&s;e, in&s;tead of con&s;titutional harmony and union for the public good, mutual hatred and mutual di&s;tru&s;t &s;till agitate their councils; faction
<PB N="36" REF="033947_0036_0FF9B9C2932D39B8">is plotting again&s;t faction: and party-marks and party names point the dagger of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in night|ly in the public &s;treets.</P>
<P>It is becau&s;e the enlightened State&s;man have reprobated, in forcible terms, the multitude of European ruffians and agitators, who have &s;pread them&s;elves throughout the &s;tates, poi&s;oning the public mind with foul calumnies, and preaching the doctrines of commotion and di&s;cord.&mdash;</P>
<P>Away, then, vile Paine! hide thy infamous head in merited ob&s;curity! nor attempt again to &s;ully the virgin paper with they corrupt gall. Thy writings &s;mell &s;trongly of the eructations of drun|kenne&s;s; and like &s;tinkpots, are &s;olely remarka|ble for their pe&s;tiferous odours.</P>
<P>But it is reported the abu&s;ive letter to General Wa&s;hington is the work of dire nece&s;&s;ity, to gain a pittance of favour from the Directory, even on the ground of hunger, and pecuniary di&s;tre&s;s: how low and degraded mu&s;t that man's feelings be, who would &s;toop to &s;uch &s;ervile adulation, and Judas-like, &s;ell his benefactor for a few pieces of &s;ilver?</P>
<Q><L>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis</L>
<L>Auri &s;acra fames!</L></Q>
<P>The late &s;trange behaviour and threats of the French, point out more clearly the true princi|ples and policy of that nation.&mdash;It is plainly conformable to their general views, of inter|meddling in every government, and engro&s;&s;ing an influence in every country; and as this cannot
<PB N="37" REF="033947_0037_0FF9BAC335A9A7D8">be done on principles of trade or equity, they regard not the method, provided they can &s;ucceed in their darling &s;chemes. The in&s;olence of the French Envoy in America,&mdash;his bu&s;y, re&s;tle&s;s, nay, factious interference, is not di&s;owned, but defended by the Directory; in&s;tead of calling him back in di&s;grace to Europe, to &s;uffer for his atrocious offence again&s;t the laws of America, and of nations, they countenance his intrigues, and vindicate his arrogance, again&s;t all principles of political ju&s;tice and plomatic faith.</P>
<P>Happily, indeed, the&s;e intriguing manoeuvres have given to the Americans no favourable idea of their pretended friends: the French have been long developing their true character even in America,&mdash;but never before dared to &s;peak in &s;o outrageous a manner with regard to the Con|gre&s;s: and Tom Paine has the daring to echo their vengeful animadver&s;ions on the public coun|&s;els of America.&mdash;The bold cant of Paine, the common topic of the Paris coffee-hou&s;e politicians is daily this&mdash;"Did not France purcha&s;e with the blood of her &s;ubjects the independence of America, and the &s;ecurity &s;he enjoys? Did not France &s;natch them from the trammels of Britain, by coming to their aid, when they were at the alternative of unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? Did not France do all this for America?"&mdash;I deny the pre|mi&s;es. France fought not for America,&mdash;&s;he fought in America, and with the aid and provi|&s;ions of America, again&s;t Great-Britain, &s;he little
<PB N="38" REF="033947_0038_0FF9D12FD0298708">regarded America,&mdash;the depre&s;&s;ion of England was the object.&mdash;She &s;ought from America a mo|nopoly of the mo&s;t advantageous branches of her commerce, in order to deprive the Engli&s;h of all intercour&s;e and &s;hare in the trade of that great Continent.&mdash;She fettered America with re&s;tric|tive clau&s;es re&s;pecting a Navy, and pre&s;cribed regulations in the We&s;t-India trade, totally in|con&s;i&s;tent with friend&s;hip and protection. She now proceeds to criminate the public act and terms of a treaty made by two independent na|tions, with a reciprocal relation to their great commercial intere&s;ts, and encourages to in&s;urrec|tion the enthu&s;ia&s;tic rancour of a little Gallic fac|tion in a few towns of the Continent.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e the tran&s;actions of friend&s;hip? Are the&s;e the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ound policy? I will only remark on this &s;ubject, that the honour of Great-Britain and America, as powerful independent States, is concerned in procuring full and ample ju&s;tice for &s;uch ho&s;tile intrigues&mdash;otherwi&s;e Ame|rica may expect, the fir&s;t opportunity, to &s;ee the &s;equel, to the overthrow of the Netherlands, and to the &s;ubjugation of Holland.</P>
<P>Let France then con&s;ider what &s;he has to ex|pect from &s;uch a friend as Paine? Let French|men judge whether &s;uch a man, in ca&s;e he could accompli&s;h the ruin of his native country, and an in&s;urrection in America would not extend his nox|ious views further, and in order to con&s;ummate the character of infamy, &s;eek to continue and to
<PB N="39" REF="033947_0039_0FF9B9D2525B8238">multiply tho&s;e calamities into which France has been plunged for years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But Providence, which hath lately &s;o eminently defeated the projects of this in&s;idious pamphleteer, and which has recently humbled the pride of our open enemy, by defeating their boa&s;ted inva&s;ion, will &s;till manife&s;t its goodne&s;s by throwing &s;hame on the evil doing of the arch-fiend Paine. We mu&s;t hope, that by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, England and America, now combined in mutual relations of commerce and pro&s;perity, will defend them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t the league formed for their injury and ruin, by the in&s;inuations and intrigues of French emi&s;&s;aries. All the efforts of a &s;uborned Paine, cannot prevent the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity from acknowledging General Wa&s;hington to have been the defender of the liberties of America again&s;t the &s;ecret agency of French coun&s;els and French gold.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid, that Mr. Paine has, by &s;ome &s;oul means or other, got into his hands a ring belonging to the unfortunate Queen of France, the motto is, <HI>En Dien mon e&s;perance</HI>&mdash;After his liberation from pri&s;on, &s;ome friend a&s;ked him, if he had &s;aved his ring? oh yes; here it is, he ex|claimed&mdash; "Mais au Diable l'e&s;perance en Dieu&mdash;The mi&s;creant was then pregnant with tho&s;e pages of impiety and profanation, to which he afterwards gave a hideous birth.</NOTE></P>
<P>But while we offer the merited tribute of prai&s;e to the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington, let us rejoice in making a ju&s;t application at home&mdash;Let us &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider the duty we owe to our beloved Monarch, who is the in&s;trument in the hands of Providence to pre&s;erve us from the horrors of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="40" REF="033947_0040_0FF9D136AEED1B78">and revolutionary equality. While irreligion and pernicious doctrines are abroad, con&s;cience, gratitude, and even &s;elf-love &s;hould prompt us to &s;upport the dignity of the Crown, and to co-operate, by every means in our power, to maintain the cau&s;e of pure religion and virtue; of ju&s;t government and regulated liberty, in op|po&s;ition to tho&s;e fanciful &s;chemes, and innovating &s;y&s;tems, which ravage and de&s;olate a once-flou|ri&s;hing and civilized country.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;and happily the argument is ap|plicable to the Government of tho&s;e kingdoms, as to America&mdash;The merit of a wi&s;e and pro&s;perous Admini&s;tration mu&s;t certainly redound to the ho|nour of the per&s;onage, who is placed at the head of affairs. The divine prerogative of communi|cating happine&s;s and glory to a great and numerous people, of nouri&s;hing them "with a true and faithful heart, and ruling them prudently with all his powers," mu&s;t &s;urely fill the mind of the chief magi&s;trate with con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, be|cau&s;e the general utility is to the people; and, however he may partake of their felicity, the difficulty, the di&s;quietude, the con&s;tant care lie upon the per&s;on, who admini&s;ters the Govern|ment.</P>
<P>Every con&s;iderate man mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the weight of the reins of Government, and every hone&s;t man, far from oppo&s;ing, will endeavour to &s;upport the hand that bears it. To be acquain|ted with the connexions and dependencies of pow|er;
