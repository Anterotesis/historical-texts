<P>THE Fir&s;t Edition of <HI>The Political Progre&s;s of Britain</HI> was publi&s;hed at Edinburgh and London, in Autumn, 1792. The &s;ale was lively, and the pro&s;pect of future &s;ucce&s;s flatter|ing. The plan was, to give an impartial hi&s;tory of the abu&s;es in government, in a &s;eries of pamphlets. But while the au|thor was preparing for the pre&s;s, a &s;econd number, along with a new edition of the fir&s;t, he was, on the 2d of January, 1793, apprehended, and with &s;ome difficulty made his e&s;cape. Two book&s;ellers, who acted as his editors, were pro&s;ecuted; and after a very arbitrary trial, they were condemned, the one to three months, and the other to &s;ix months of impri&s;onment. A revolution will take place in Scotland before the lap&s;e of ten years at farthe&s;t, and mo&s;t likely much &s;ooner. The Scots nation will then certainly think it&s;elf bound, by every tie of wi&s;dom, of gratitude, and of ju&s;tice, to make reparation to the&s;e two hone&s;t men, for the tyranny which they have en|countered in the cau&s;e of truth. In Britain, authors and editors of pamphlets have long conducted the van of every revolution. They compo&s;e a kind of forlorn hope on the &s;kirts of battle: and though they may often want experi|ence, or influence, to mar&s;hal the main body, they yet enjoy the honour and the danger of the fir&s;t rank, in &s;torming the ramparts of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A copy of the fir&s;t edition was handed to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, late American Secretary of State. He &s;poke of it, on diffe|rent occa&s;ions, in re&s;pectful terms. <Q>He &s;aid that it contained the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing concentration of abu&s;es that he had ever heard of in any government.</Q> He inquired, why it was not printed in America? and &s;aid, that he, for one, would gladly become a purcha&s;er. Other gentlemen have delivered their opinions to the &s;ame effect; and their encou|ragement was one cau&s;e for the appearance of this Ameri|can edition.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028380_0003_0FD8BE750EFE2A50">The work is intended for that cla&s;s of people who has not much time to &s;pend in reading, and who wants a plain but &s;ub&s;tantial meal of political information. The facts are, therefore, crowded together as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible. All the co|quetry of author&s;hip has been avoided. The ambition of the writer was to be candid, unaffected, and intelligible; be|cau&s;e truth is the ba&s;is of &s;ound argument, &s;implicity the &s;oul of elegance, and per&s;picuity the &s;upreme touch-&s;tone of accu|rate compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>A report was circulated, and believed, in Scotland, that this production came, in reality, from the pen of one of the judges of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The charge was unju&s;t.

<P>For the extreme ra&s;hne&s;s of his plan, the writer can|not offer an apology that prudence will accept. A &s;hort &s;tory may, perhaps, convey the motives of his conduct.

The Engli&s;h a&s;ked him, whether he expected that his two mu&s;kets were to &s;ilence the fire of their fleet?

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WITHIN the la&s;t hundred years of our hi&s;tory, Britain has been five times at war with France, and &s;ix times at war with Spain. During the &s;ame period, &s;he has been engaged in two rebellions at home, be&s;ides an endle&s;s catalogue of ma&s;&s;a|cres in A&s;ia and America. In Europe, the common price which we advance for a war, has extended from one to three hundred thou&s;and lives, and from &s;ixty to an hundred and fifty millions &s;terling. From Africa, we import annually between thirty and forty thou&s;and &s;laves, which ri&s;es in the cour&s;e of a century to at lea&s;t three millions of murthers. In Bengal only, we de|&s;troyed or expelled, within the &s;hort period of &s;ix years, no le&s;s than five millions of indu&s;trious and harmle&s;s people <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Infra, chap. 1.</NOTE>; and as we have been &s;overeigns in that country, for above thirty-five years, it may be rea&s;onably computed that we have &s;trewed the plains of Indo&s;tan with fifteen or twenty millions of carca&s;es. If we combine the diver&s;ified ravages of famine, pe&s;tilence, and the &s;word, it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in the&s;e tran&s;actions le&s;s than fifteen hundred thou&s;and of our countrymen have pe|ri&s;hed; a number equal to that of the whole inhabitants of Bri|tain who are at pre&s;ent able to bear arms. In Europe, the ha|vock of our antagoni&s;ts has been at lea&s;t not inferior to our own, &s;o that this quarter of the world alone has lo&s;t by our quarrels, three millions of men in the flower of life; who&s;e de&s;cendants, in the progre&s;s of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, would have &s;welled into multitudes beyond calculation. The per&s;ons po&s;itively de&s;troyed mu&s;t, in the whole, have exceeded twenty millions, or two hun|dred thou&s;and acts of homicide <HI>per annum.</HI> The&s;e victims have been &s;acrificed to the balance of power, and the balance of trade, the honour of the Briti&s;h flag, the univer&s;al &s;upremacy of par|liament,
<PB N="4" REF="028380_0005_0FD8DE48DFC5B290">
and the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. If we are to proceed at this rate for another century, we may, which is natural to mankind, admire our&s;elves, and our atchievements, but every other nation in the world mu&s;t have a right to wi&s;h that an earthquake or a volcano may fir&s;t bury both i&s;lands to|gether in the centre of the globe; that a &s;ingle, but deci&s;ive ex|ortion of Almighty vengeance may terminate the progre&s;s and the remembrance of our crimes.</P>
<P>In the &s;cale of ju&s;t calculation, the mo&s;t valuable commodity, next to human blood, is money. Having made a gro&s;s e&s;timate of the de&s;truction of the former, let us endeavour to compute the con&s;umption of the latter. The war of 1689 co&s;t &s;ixty mil|lions of public money, and at the end of it, the public debts amounted to twenty millions, or by another account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Britain and Ireland, vol. ii.</NOTE>, to be &s;eventeen millions and a half; &s;o that not more than one third part of the expences were <HI>borrowed.</HI> In Queen Anne's war, forty or fifty millions &s;terling were al&s;o &s;unk in the &s;ame man|ner, be&s;ides about thirty millions, which were added to the former public debt. Very large &s;ums have &s;ince been ab&s;orbed in other wars, over and above tho&s;e which were placed to the national credit. In 1783, by the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners of public accounts, the total debts of Britain extended to two hundred and &s;eventy-nine millions, &s;ix hundred and ninety-eight thou&s;and pounds, though many millions have been paid off in time of peace, by what is called the &s;inking fund. Hence we &s;ee, that this &s;um of <HI>two hundred and &s;eventy-nine millions</HI> is much inferior to the actual charges of the&s;e wars. The total amount may be fixed &s;omewhere perhaps between four and &s;ix hundred millions. To this we mu&s;t &s;ubjoin the value of &s;ix|teen or twenty thou&s;and merchant &s;hips taken by the enemy. This diminutive article of &s;ixty or an hundred millions would have been &s;ufficient for tran&s;porting and &s;ettling eight or twelve hundred thou&s;and farmers, with their families, on the banks of the Potowmack or the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi. By the report above quoted, we learn, that in 1789, the intere&s;t of our public debts ex|tended
<PB N="5" REF="028380_0006_0FD8DE4A9ABD0050">
to nine millions, and five hundred thou&s;and pounds, which is equivalent to an annual tax of twenty &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> head, on every inhabitant of Britain. The friends of our intel|ligent and re&s;pectable mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, make an infinite bu&s;tle about the nine millions of debt which his ingenuity has di&s;|charged. They ought to arrange, in an oppo&s;ite column, a li&s;t of the additional taxes which have been impo&s;ed, and of the myriads of families, whom &s;uch taxes have ruined. At be&s;t, we are but as a per&s;on transferring his money from the right pocket to the left. Perhaps a Chancellor of the Exchequer might as well propo&s;e to empty the Baltick with a tobacco-pipe. Had the war with America la&s;ted for two years longer, Britain would not at this day have owed a &s;hilling; and if we &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in ru&s;hing into carnage, with our former contempt of all feeling and reflection, it may &s;till be expected that, ac|cording to the practice of other nations, a &s;ponge or a bonfire will fini&s;h the game of funding.</P>
<P>What advantage has re&s;ulted to Britain from &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant &s;cenes of prodigality and of blood&s;hed? In the wars of 1689, and 1702, this country was neither more nor le&s;s than an hobby hor&s;e for the Emperor and the Dutch. The rebellion in 1715 was excited by the de&s;potic in&s;olence of the Whigs. The pur|cha&s;e of Bremen and Verden produced the Spani&s;h war of 1718, and a &s;quadron di&s;patched for &s;ix different years to the Baltick. Such exertions co&s;t us an hundred times more than tho&s;e quag|mire Dutchies are worth, even to the Elector of Hanover; a di&s;tinction which on this bu&s;ine&s;s becomes nece&s;&s;ary, for as to Britain, it was never pretended, that we could gain a farthing by &s;uch an acqui&s;ition. In 1727, the nation forced George the Fir&s;t into a war with Spain, which ended as u&s;ual with much mi&s;chief on both &s;ides. The Spani&s;h war of the people in 1739, and the Au&s;trian &s;ub&s;idy war of the crown, which com|menced in 1741, were ab&s;urd in their principles, and ruinous in their con&s;equences. At &s;ea, we met with nothing but hard blows. On the continent, we began by hiring the Queen of Hungary to fight her own battles again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; and ten years after the war ended, we hired the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
<PB N="6" REF="028380_0007_0FD8DE4EDF171758">
with &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-one thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> to fight his own battles again&s;t her. If this be not folly, what are we to call it? As to the quarrel of 1754, <Q>It was re|marked by all Europe, &s;ays Frederick, that in her di&s;pute with France, <HI>every wrong &s;tep was on the &s;ide of England.</HI></Q> By nine years of butchery, and an additional debt of &s;eventy millions &s;terling, we &s;ecured Canada; but had Wolfe and his army been driven from the heights of Abraham, our grand&s;ons might have come too early to hear of an American revolution. As to this event, the circum&s;tances are too &s;hocking for reflec|tion. At that time an Engli&s;h woman had di&s;covered a remedy for the canine madne&s;s, and Frederick advi&s;es a French cor|re&s;pondent <HI>to recommend this medicine to the u&s;e of the Parliament of England, as they mu&s;t certainly have been bitten by a mad dog.</HI></P>
<P>In the quarrels of the Continent we &s;hould concern our&s;elves but little; for in a defen&s;ive war, we may &s;afely defy all the nations of Europe. When the whole civilized world was em|bodied under the banners of Rome, her Dictator, at the head of thirty thou&s;and veterans, di&s;embarked for a &s;econd time on the coa&s;t of Britain. The face of the country was covered with a fore&s;t, and the &s;olitary tribes were divided upon the old que&s;|tion, <HI>Who &s;hall be king?</HI> The i&s;land could hardly have attained to a twentieth part of its pre&s;ent population, yet by his own account, the invader found a retreat prudent, or perhaps nece&s;|&s;ary. South Britain was afterwards &s;ubjected, but this acqui&s;i|tion was the ta&s;k of centuries. Every village was bought with the blood of the legions. We may confide in the moderation of a Roman Hi&s;torian, when he is to de&s;cribe the di&s;a&s;ters of his countrymen. In a &s;ingle revolt, eighty thou&s;and of the u&s;urpers were extirpated; and fifty, or, as others affirm, &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;oldiers peri&s;hed in the cour&s;e of a Caledonian cam|paign. Do the ma&s;ters of modern Europe under&s;tand the art of war better than Severus, and Agricola, and Julius Cae&s;ar? Is any combination of human power to be compared with the ta|lents and re&s;ources of the Roman empire? If our naked an|ce&s;tors re&s;i&s;ted and vanqui&s;hed the conquerors of the &s;pecies, what have we to fear from any antagoni&s;t of this day? On &s;ix
<PB N="7" REF="028380_0008_0FD8DE5129D211E8">
months warning we could mu&s;ter ten or twelve hundred thou|&s;and militia. Yet, while the de&s;pots of Germany were fight|ing about a &s;uburb, the nation has conde&s;cended to tremble for its exi&s;tence, and the blo&s;&s;oms of dome&s;tic happine&s;s have been bla&s;ted by &s;ub&s;idies, and tide-waiters, and pre&s;s-gangs, and ex|ci&s;emen. Our political and commercial &s;y&s;tems are evidently non&s;en&s;e. We po&s;&s;e&s;s within this &s;ingle i&s;land, every produc|tion, both of art and nature, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the mo&s;t comfortable enjoyment of life; yet for the &s;ake of tea, and &s;u|gar, and tobacco, and a few other de&s;picable luxuries, we have ru&s;hed into an aby&s;s of blood and taxes. The boa&s;ted extent of our trade, and the quarrels and public debts which attend it, have rai&s;ed the price of bread, and even of gra&s;s, at lea&s;t three hundred <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>This pamphlet con&s;i&s;ts not of fluent declamation, but of curious authenticated and important facts, with a few &s;hort ob&s;ervations inter&s;per&s;ed, which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to explain them. The reader will meet with no mournful periods to the memory of <HI>annual</HI> or <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments; for while the members are men &s;uch as their predece&s;&s;ors have almo&s;t always been, it is but of &s;mall concern whether they hold their places for life, or but for a &s;ingle day. Some of our projectors are of opinion, that to &s;horten the duration of parliament would be an ample remedy for all our grievances. The advantages of a popular election have likewi&s;e been much extolled. Yet an acquaintance with Thucydides, or Plutarch, or Guicciardini, or Machiavel, may tend to calm the raptures of a republican apo&s;tle. The plan of univer&s;al &s;uffrages has been loudly recommended by the Duke of Richmond; and, on the 16th of May 1782, that nobleman, &s;econded by Mr. Horne Tooke, and Mr. Pitt, was &s;itting in a tavern, compo&s;ing adverti&s;ements of reformation for the new&s;|papers. MUTANTUR TEMPORA. But had his plan been adopted, it is po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould at this day, have looked back with regret, on the humiliating yet tranquil de&s;poti&s;m of a Scots, or a Corni&s;h borough.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of this work is conci&s;e and plain; and it is hoped that it will be found &s;ufficiently re&s;pectful to all parties. The
<PB N="8" REF="028380_0009_0FD8DE529C990F68">
que&s;tion to be decided is, are we to proceed with the war &s;y&s;tem? Are we, in the progre&s;s of the nineteenth century, to embrace five thou&s;and fre&s;h taxes, to &s;quander a &s;econd five hundred millions &s;terling, and to extirpate twenty millions of people?</P>

<P>It &s;eems to have been long a maxim of the monopolizing di|rectors of our &s;outhern ma&s;ters, to extirpate, as quickly as po&s;|&s;ible, every manufacture in this country, that interferes with their own.

Has not the manufacture of &s;tarch al&s;o been driven, by every engine of judicial torture, to the la&s;t pang of its exi&s;tence? Have not the manufacturers of paper, printed callicoes, malt liquors and gla&s;s, been harra&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t vexatious methods of exacting the revenue? methods equivalent to an addition of ten, or &s;ometimes an hundred <HI>per cent.</HI> of the duty payable.

Nor was it becau&s;e Walpole had pilfered five hundred guineas that he was expelled and &s;ent to the Tower.

<P>The writer has here committed a &s;light inaccuracy; for, in the debate about Walpole, the&s;e two hundred and fifty-four members, who are not, in fact, elected by a two hundredth part of the nation, would have &s;eemed an actual majority of &s;ix votes again&s;t the whole other repre&s;entatives in the Hou&s;e. In the year 1770, the Engli&s;h nation became jealous that their liberties were in danger, becau&s;e Government had interfered in the election of Mr. Wilkes, as a member for the county of Mid|dle&s;ex. The letters of Junius are chiefly employed upon this
<PB N="18" REF="028380_0019_0FD8DE6A9C73BCB8">
topic. Junius, with all his merit, re&s;embled a barber, who plucks out a &s;ingle hair, when he ought to be &s;having your beard. It could not be of the lea&s;t con&s;equence to the county of Middle&s;ex, nor is it of any concern to any other county in England, who are their repre&s;entatives, &s;ince the two hundred and fifty-four members who are elected by A TWO HUN|DREDTH PART of the nation, and the forty-five make-weight Scotch members, are alone &s;ufficient to in&s;ure a majority. The &s;ubject is too ab&s;urd to admit of an argument, and too dete&s;ta|ble for declamation. If Government were candidly to &s;end two hundred and fifty-four exci&s;emen, or clerks from the Bank of England, into parliament, in place of the&s;e two hundred and fifty-four members, it would &s;ave the expence of election, and a great part of the nece&s;&s;ary expence of corruption. It is true, that the ma&s;ters of rotten boroughs are often inrolled in the ranks of oppo&s;ition; and among others, the Earl of Chatham began his progre&s;s as a member for Old Sarum. But an oppo|&s;ition always con&s;i&s;ts, in part, of adventures, who, as Dr. John|&s;on ob&s;erves, <Q>having e&s;timated them&s;elves at two high a price, are only angry that they are not <HI>bought</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Fal&s;e Alarm.</NOTE>.</Q> There is a cant expre&s;&s;ion in this country, that our Government is de&s;ervedly <HI>the wonder and envy of the world.</HI> With better rea&s;on it may be &s;aid, that Parliament is a mere outwork of the court, a pha|lanx of mercenaries embattled again&s;t the rea&s;on, the happine&s;s, and the liberty of mankind.

<P>IT is now eighty-eight years &s;ince <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1704.</NOTE> we &s;urpri&s;ed Gibraltar. We have retained this barren, u&s;ele&s;s rock, under the pre|tence of protecting our trade in the Mediterranean; and it is even a &s;orry conceit in Britain that we are thus ma&s;ters of a kind of toll-bar to the entrance of that &s;ea. Had the pa&s;&s;age been only five hundred yards wide, this fancy would have had &s;ome foundation. But, unfortunately, the <HI>Strait,</HI> as we call it, is <HI>twenty miles</HI> in breadth; &s;o that all the &s;hips in the world may pa&s;s it every day, in contempt of all our batteries. As to the protection of our merchants, it is equally &s;uperfluous, for our commerce to that part of Europe was far more exten&s;ive, long before we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Gibraltar, than it is at this moment <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance has been fully explained by Dr. Adam Smith, in his Inquiry, book 4, chap. 7.</NOTE>; and this unque&s;tionable fact proves the ab&s;olute impertinence of the whole &s;cheme. A plain compari&s;on from dome&s;tic life will il|lu&s;trate what I &s;ay. Let us put the ca&s;e, that a private gentle|man is like Britain, overwhelmed with debt. He builds and furni&s;hes a hand&s;ome inn on the road to his country &s;eat, and he gives the premi&s;es to his butler, with a pen&s;ion of five hun|dred pounds, on condition, that in dirty weather, he &s;hall be &s;uffered to pull off his boots in the kitchen. But were even the port of Gibraltar &s;unk to the centre of the earth, we can have no want of &s;helter at the &s;horte&s;t di&s;tance. There are three ports on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Strait. Be&s;ides, we cannot re|tain this fortre&s;s, unle&s;s we pre&s;erve a &s;uperiority at &s;ea, and as
<PB N="20" REF="028380_0021_0FD8DE6F1B1194A8">
long as we pre&s;erve that &s;uperiority, Gibraltar is of no con&s;e|quence. For the memorable progre&s;s of Admiral Blake on the coa&s;t of Barbary proves, that while we can launch a victorious navy, manned as it is by a race of veterans beyond all prai&s;e, we can always command a free navigation in every harbour of the globe. So much for the importance of this boa&s;ted acqui|&s;ition. Let us now con&s;ider its expence; and on this head the reader may, if he thinks proper, prepare him&s;elf for a&s;toni&s;h|ment. The fortre&s;s, for a long period pa&s;t, has co&s;t us five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year, be&s;ides the extraordinary advances in time of war, and the &s;ums which the garri&s;on, by &s;ober in|du&s;try, might have earned at home in time of peace. For the &s;ake of moderation, let us compute that Gibraltar, during the whole &s;pace of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, has required, upon an average, only two hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> on multiplying this &s;um by eighty-eight, we are pre&s;ented with an amount of &s;eventeen millions and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Could the premi&s;es be di&s;puted, the total expence would ex|ceed credibility; for at the rate of five <HI>per cent.</HI> of compound intere&s;t, a &s;um doubles it&s;elf in fourteen years; and, con&s;e|quently, in the cour&s;e of eighty-four years, from 1704, to 1788, the fir&s;t payment of two hundred thou&s;and pounds will increa&s;e to twelve millions and eight hundred thou&s;and. The &s;imple intere&s;t of this &s;um, for the four additional years, from 1788 to 1792 inclu&s;ive, amounts to two millions five hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, and the whole ari&s;es to <HI>fifteen millions three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds.</HI> This, however, concerns only <HI>one</HI> year of our conque&s;t. The fir&s;t four years extend in the whole to <HI>fifty-&s;even millions and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</HI> Another lo&s;s al&s;o mu&s;t be taken into this unfathom|able accompt. The garri&s;on of this fortre&s;s con&s;i&s;ts always of at lea&s;t four thou&s;and men, and &s;ometimes of more than twice that number. An ordinary workman can earn ten &s;hillings a week, and the labour of four thou&s;and &s;uch workmen is worth to the public above an hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum.</HI> This adds one third part more of additional lo&s;s. The total expence therefore, which this acqui&s;ition exhau&s;ted in the fir&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="028380_0022_0FD8DE71ED0ADA70">
four years only, including the legal intere&s;t of our money down to this day, cannot have been le&s;s than <HI>eighty-&s;ix millions four hundred thou&s;and pounds.</HI> We are likewi&s;e entitled to compute not only what we have po&s;itively lo&s;t, but what we might with equal certainty have gained. Britain and Ireland contain about an hundred and four thou&s;and &s;quare miles, and if this &s;um of eighty-&s;ix millions four hundred thou&s;and pounds had been expended on the purpo&s;es of agriculture, it would have &s;upplied a fund of eight hundred and thirty pounds &s;ter|ling for every &s;quare mile. Hence, in&s;tead of an intere&s;t of <HI>five</HI> per cent. the funds thus employed would have returned a profit of <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twenty,</HI> or perhaps of <HI>fifty</HI> per cent.</P>
<P>The reader may pro&s;ecute, and contemplate the &s;equel of this calculation. All the current ca&s;h in Europe, or in the world, would come infinitely &s;hort of di&s;charging &s;uch a reck|oning. Britain may be &s;uppo&s;ed at this time to contain about fifteen hundred thou&s;and families, be&s;ides tho&s;e who are &s;up|ported upon charity. Now, dividing the pre&s;ent annual ex|pence of five hundred thou&s;and pounds equally among them, it amounts to a &s;hare of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence <HI>per</HI> family. The money ought to be rai&s;ed under a di&s;tinct title, &s;uch as the Gibraltar <HI>additional &s;hilling of land tax,</HI> the Gibraltar <HI>malt tax,</HI> the Gibraltar <HI>exci&s;e on tobacco,</HI> the Gibraltar <HI>game licence,</HI> the Gibraltar <HI>hor&s;e licence,</HI> the Gibraltar <HI>attorney licence,</HI> or the Gib|raltar <HI>&s;tamp duty on legacies.</HI> In that ca&s;e, the nation would in&s;tantly con&s;ider what they are about, and ca&s;t off &s;uch a prepo&s;terous burden. The payment of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence is frequently the &s;malle&s;t part of the grievance. By the expence of exci&s;emen, of pro&s;ecutions, and of penalties, five &s;hillings of revenue may often co&s;t a Briti&s;h <HI>freeman</HI> ten times as many pounds &s;terling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall mention an example in point, which occurs while I am now writing.

<P><PB N="22" REF="028380_0023_0FD8DE72DD42CC88">Before the acqui&s;ition of Gibraltar, England, in the whole cour&s;e of her hi&s;tory, had only three wars with Spain. The fir&s;t in 1588, was produced by the piracies of Drake and others, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Elizabeth afforded to the Dutch re|volters. The &s;econd war was likewi&s;e unprovoked on the part of Spain. Cromwell found it nece&s;&s;ary to vent the turbulence of his &s;ubjects in a foreign quarrel, and Jamaica was invaded and &s;eized without even a pretence of ju&s;tice. On this conque&s;t chiefly has England founded that hopeful branch of her com|merce, the Slave-Trade, while the climate has annually extir|pated, by thou&s;ands, the vagrants from Europe. The third Spa|ni&s;h war had an origin worthy of its predece&s;&s;ors. The King of Spain, by his will, transferred his dominions to a Prince of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. His &s;ubjects con&s;ented or &s;ubmitted to the choice, and England, with a degree of in&s;olence unmatched in hi&s;tory, interfered in favour of an Au&s;trian candidate. The conte&s;t ended with our acqui&s;ition of Minorca, and Gibraltar; an injury to Spain of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive nature. Since that period her court has always been forward to contend with us; and five wars <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz.</HI> in 1718, in 1727, in 1739, in 1762, and in 1779.</NOTE>, begun and terminated in the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;ixty-five years, a&s;&s;ures us of their indelible indignation. Nor can we be &s;urpri&s;ed at their animo&s;ity; for what would an Eng|li&s;hman &s;ay or feel, were Plymouth and Dover fortified by a French garri&s;on? Happily for the &s;pecies, our countrymen at Gibraltar have been but &s;eldom attacked. Hence, in a time of war, they have commonly inflicted and &s;uffered far le&s;s mi&s;chief than mu&s;t have been committed on both &s;ides in a piratical ex|pedition

<P>In 1708, we captured Minorca, and after what has been &s;aid as to Gibraltar, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on the mon|&s;terous expences which it mu&s;t have co&s;t us during half a cen|tury, till it was in 1756 &s;urrendered to the French. On this event the whole Engli&s;h nation &s;eemed to have run out of their &s;en&s;es. Yet to the lo&s;s of this fortre&s;s, we may in &s;ome mea|&s;ure attribute our <HI>&s;ucce&s;s,</HI> as it was called, in that war; for the charge of &s;upporting Minorca mu&s;t have been felt as a dead weight upon our other operations. It was re&s;tored in 1763, and in 1781, it was a &s;econd time, and I hope for ever, &s;eparated from the Briti&s;h dominions. By the lo&s;s of this fortre&s;s we &s;ave an ince&s;&s;ant and extravagant expence. With me it is an object of regret, that the brave Elliot and his garri&s;on had not been forced to capitulate by the fir&s;t bomb di&s;charged again&s;t them. The individuals, acting as they did, from the mo&s;t ge|nerous and honourable principles, have acquired and de&s;erved our warme&s;t gratitude; and, as it may be expected that &s;uch events will hereafter become le&s;s frequent, their glory will de|&s;cend with increa&s;ing lu&s;tre to the la&s;t generations of mankind. But their efforts were fatal to this country; for it is &s;elf-evident that we had much better have wanted this mock appendage of empire. The &s;iege it&s;elf produced &s;cenes of &s;uch &s;tupenduous de&s;truction, that they cannot be peru&s;ed without horror. Nine years of peace have &s;ince elap&s;ed, and, in that time, including the endle&s;s expence of fortifications, it is probable that Gib|raltar has co&s;t us at lea&s;t five millions &s;terling; be&s;ides, we have been again on the verge of a war with Spain, which has added a comfortable <HI>item</HI> of four millions to the debts of the nation. If the annual expence of Gibraltar amounts to five hundred thou&s;and pounds, this is about one thirty-&s;econd part of our
<PB N="24" REF="028380_0025_0FD8DE7CAACD88E8">
public revenue. Nothing but the power of its di&s;po&s;al can ob|tain for a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter a majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons.

In the regency que&s;tion, Mr. Pitt, with the whole nation at his back, mu&s;tered only two hundred and &s;ixty-nine members.</NOTE>; and therefore the patronage of Gib|raltar may be conjectured to purcha&s;e ten votes in the market of St. Stephen's chapel <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Spani&s;h negociation in 1757, the Earl of Chatham (then Mr. Pitt) propo&s;ed to cede Gibraltar to Spain, and again, in 1761, he offered it as <HI>the price of the Family Compact.</HI> Vide <HI>His Life,</HI> in two large volumes ju&s;t publi&s;hed. This propo&s;al evinces, that the fortre&s;s was not, in Mr. Pitt's opinion, of much importance to Britain.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though writers have pre&s;umed to &s;pecify the annual charge of Gibraltar, an exact e&s;timate cannot po&s;&s;ibly be obtained. The public accounts are pre&s;ented to parliament in a &s;tate of in|extricable confu&s;ion. Indeed, their immen&s;e bulk would alone be &s;ufficient to place them far beyond the reach of any human comprehen&s;ion. A &s;ingle circum&s;tance may &s;erve to &s;how the way in which parliamentary bu&s;ine&s;s is commonly performed. A &s;tatute was pa&s;&s;ed and printed &s;ome years ago, containing three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive references to the <HI>thirty</HI>-FIRST day of November.</P>
<P>For a foreign conte&s;t, our government is mo&s;t wretchedly adapted. In the war of 1756, Frederick, that Shake&s;peare of kings, fought and conquered five different nations. In the cour&s;e of his miraculous campaigns, he neither added a &s;ingle impo&s;t, nor attempted to borrow a &s;ingle &s;hilling. At the &s;ame time our boa&s;ted Earl of Chatham was overwhelming this coun|try with taxes, and contracting an annual debt of fifteen or twenty millions &s;terling. With a more de&s;tructive mini&s;ter no nation was ever cur&s;ed. Yet this man we prefer to Sir Robert Walpole, a &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e maxim it was to keep us, if po&s;|&s;ible, at peace with all the world.</P>
<P>In 1662, Dunkirk, then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by England, co&s;t an annual
<PB N="25" REF="028380_0026_0FD8DE7CAEA3C9F0">
expence of an hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds. At the &s;ame period the whole revenues of the nation did not amount to eleven hundred thou&s;and pounds. The retention of the town mu&s;t have proved a hot-bed of future wars with France. Charles the Second, at this time &s;old it to Lewis the Fourteenth, for the &s;um of four hundred thou&s;and pounds. This was, I believe, the only wi&s;e, laudable, or even innocent action of his reign. It had almo&s;t produced a rebellion; and, as Mr. Hume ob&s;erves, <Q>has not had the good fortune, to be ju&s;tified by any party.</Q></P>
<P>Dome&s;tic improvement is, in all ca&s;es, more advantageous than military acqui&s;ition. Yet in the great outlines of our hi&s;tory, we have ince&s;&s;antly for&s;aken the former, to pur&s;ue the latter. James the Fir&s;t, though in private, and even in public life, univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, was one of the be&s;t &s;overeigns that ever &s;at on the Briti&s;h throne. Without a &s;ingle quality which could recommend him to our e&s;teem, he pre&s;erved the Engli&s;h nation, though much again&s;t their will, in peace, during his en|tire reign of twenty-two years. Hence both i&s;lands made ra|pid advances in wealth and pro&s;perity. "Never," &s;ays Stowe, <Q>was there any people, le&s;s con&s;iderate, and le&s;s thank|ful than at this time, <HI>being not willing to endure the memory of their pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</HI></Q> On the &s;ame principles of rapine, which dictated the retention of Dunkirk, James has been &s;e|verely blamed for delivering back to the Dutch three of their for|tified towns, which had been put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Eliza|beth. Mr. Hume has, with much propriety, vindicated his con|duct. Had it been po&s;&s;ible that the life of &s;uch a prince, and the tranquillity of this country, could have been prolonged to the pre|&s;ent day, it is beyond the power of Briti&s;h vanity to conceive the accumulated progre&s;s of Briti&s;h opulence. Both i&s;lands would, long before this time, have advanced to a &s;tate of cultivation, not inferior to that of China. The productions of the &s;oil, and the number of inhabitants, might have exceeded, by tenfold, their pre&s;ent amount. Public roads, canals, bridges, and buildings of every de&s;cription, mu&s;t have multiplied far beyond what our mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes are capable of conceiving.

<P>This account does not give us much encouragement to &s;end for a &s;econd &s;overeign from Holland. Dutch genero&s;ity ap|pears to have proved a very mi&s;erable bargain.

the&s;e mini&s;ters to drive the King of England into tho&s;e very mea&s;ures which forced a Revolution.

Yet all the bi&s;hops, except eight, as well as many temporal peers, refu&s;ed to take the oaths to the new government; and Sancroft, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had been at the head of the oppo&s;ition to James, was, along with five other bi&s;hops, depo&s;ed for his re|fu&s;al. The convention parliament who made William King of England, were <HI>elected by him&s;elf,</HI> and contained, be&s;ides other extraordinary materials, <HI>fifty members of the Common Council of London.</HI> With this very parliament he was immediately on the wor&s;t terms; and Sutherland, Marlborough, and Admiral Ru&s;|&s;el, with many other chiefs of his party, entered into a con&s;pi|racy for his expul&s;ion. The Iri&s;h rebels had forfeited lands to the value of three millions three hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds. This immen&s;e property William divided almo&s;t alto|gether among his Dutch favourites, and the Counte&s;s of Ork|ney, an Engli&s;h concubine, who&s;e &s;ervices were rewarded with an e&s;tate of twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year; while, at the &s;ame time, with the mo&s;t &s;ordid ingratitude, he turned his back on the family of Monmouth, who had been his tool and his vic|tim.

To the queen he never paid a farthing, and to the Duke only fifteen thou&s;and pounds a year. This prince died on the 24th of July 1700, and in 1701 the Commons, after a violent debate with the adherents of the court, compelled William to refund the fifty thou&s;and pounds, which he had engaged to pay to the exiled queen; and above twenty thou&s;and pounds, which the Duke of Glouce&s;ter had left behind him <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 3 and 4.

But &s;ince we know this to be true, why are we di&s;turbed with rhap&s;odies on one of the mo&s;t que&s;tionable com|binations that ever deformed hi&s;tory? Does any body compare the packed convention parliaments of the two kingdoms, in 1689, with the democratical members of the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;em|bly of France? As well might we parallel Charles Jenkin&s;on with the Duke of Sully, or the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of Culloden with the conqueror at Bannockburn. Did the philo&s;ophical and conci&s;e decrees of the French patriots grovel in the feudal jargon of &s;ubjecting a people and their po&s;terity forever to the a&s;&s;ignees of a Dutchman who was univer&s;ally dete&s;ted? As well might we fancy a re&s;emblance between the daubing of a &s;ign-po&s;t, and the pencil of Reynolds, or the exerci&s;e of a &s;chool-boy and the &s;tanzas of Buchanan.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as William betrayed James into &s;everal of tho&s;e crimes by which a revolution became nece&s;&s;ary, his me|mory is an object not of re&s;pect but abhorrence. His conduct was like that of an incendiary who fir&s;t &s;ets fire to your hou&s;e, and then claims ten times the worth of the whole building for his &s;ervice in quenching it. To prai&s;e him and his revolution, di&s;covers an ignorance of hi&s;tory, or a contempt of common hone&s;ty. It is as much a burle&s;que upon rea&s;on, as when a King of England calls him&s;elf King of France; or as when a

per&s;on, like Henry the Eighth, who&s;e word is tru&s;ted by no|body, a&s;&s;umes for his title <HI>Defender of the Faith.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince the authors of the revolution did not &s;urpa&s;s the di|minutive &s;tandard of Court integrity, why has our temple of venality <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Anecdotes of Lord Chatham, we are told that Mr. Pelham was intru&s;ted with <HI>what is u&s;ally called</HI> THE POCKET LIST OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS; and Mr. Pitt &s;ometimes &s;aid to his friends, "I was obliged to BORROW the Duke of Newca&s;tle's "<HI>majority,</HI> to carry on the public bu&s;ine&s;s."</NOTE> for &s;o long a time re&s;ounded with the wretched laram of whig families and whig virtues?

This &s;um is equal to the di&s;charge of our national debts forty-eight times over, and is five hun|dred and &s;eventy-five times greater than the whole gold and &s;ilver coin at pre&s;ent in the three kingdoms.

<P>An objection may be advanced to this &s;tatement, that a great part of the &s;ixty millions thus expended by government was <HI>em|bezzled among our&s;elves,</HI> and that as it never actually went out of the country, <HI>we are not at this day a farthing poorer than if the money had never been rai&s;ed.</HI> If we might oppo&s;e the language of common &s;en&s;e to the jargon of political &s;ophi&s;try, I would an&s;wer, that when a grazier in York&s;hire has been knocked down and robbed, he cares but little whether his guineas are to be &s;taked at the gaming tables of Paris or of London.

This is not very fea&s;ible, for what is won in a bad way is com|monly
<PB N="35" REF="028380_0036_0FD8DE965BCD85F0">
&s;pent in a wor&s;e one; but let us proceed. In e&s;timating the expences of the war, there was <HI>omitted</HI> an article of lo&s;s at lea&s;t equivalent to the&s;e thirty millions. It has been ob&s;erved, that a workman can, upon an average, earn about ten &s;hillings a-week, which in London is at pre&s;ent about half the common wages of a journeyman taylor. Reduce this to twenty-five pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> and his life may be e&s;timated at twelve years purcha&s;e, or three hundred pounds in value to the public. In the war in que&s;tion, we lo&s;t an hundred thou&s;and men, and by this moderate and &s;imple computation, the price of their blood to Britain was not worth le&s;s than thirty millions Sterling. Even this number of an hundred thou&s;and lives is mo&s;t likely far le&s;s than the actual de&s;truction. Four thou&s;and merchant &s;hips were taken by the French privateers, and the&s;e alone mu&s;t have re|quired, one with another, twelve or thirteen mariners, which gives us an amount of fifty thou&s;and pri&s;oners; of whom, be|&s;ides the numbers killed, at lea&s;t ten or fifteen thou&s;and would peri&s;h of jail di&s;tempers, of their wounds, of cold or hunger, and above all, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>As the pillage of public money is one of the wor&s;t con&s;e|quences of war, I &s;hall here &s;ay &s;omething farther on that &s;ub|ject. In 1695, Knight and Duncombe, two members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, were expelled for having forged indor&s;e|ments on Exchequer bills. Duncombe confe&s;&s;ed the charge, and his &s;hare of the booty had extended to <HI>four hundred thou|&s;and pounds.</HI> I am not informed what was the amount of Knight's plunder; or that of &s;everal others who were concerned. The Commons, in a fit of purity, pa&s;&s;ed a bill to fine Duncombe in half his e&s;tate. By the &s;tatute laws of England, he &s;hould have &s;uffered death. The bill for his fine was rejected in the hou&s;e of Lords <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, part iii. book 4.</NOTE>, by the ca&s;ting vote of the Duke of Leeds, who was him&s;elf a &s;windler of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. The Earl of Che&s;terfield had &s;ome rea&s;on for terming that hou&s;e an ho&s;|pital of <HI>Incurables.</HI> Salmon tells us, that the mini&s;try gave whatever intere&s;t and premiums were demanded for the loan of
<PB N="36" REF="028380_0037_0FD8DE979EAA9600">
money, and that provi&s;ions and naval &s;tores were taken up at an advance of thirty, forty, and &s;ometimes fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> above their proper price. But, indeed, after the dimi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Duncombe, <HI>with his four hundred thou&s;and pounds in his pocket,</HI> every charge of this kind becomes perfectly credible.</P>
<P>Whether in the pre&s;ent age, matters have been much mended, there was nobody better able to inform us than the late Earl of Chatham. <Q>There is a &s;et of men, &s;ays he, in the city of London, who are known to live in riot and luxury, upon the plunder of the ignorant, the innocent, and the helple&s;s, upon that part of the community, which &s;tands mo&s;t in need of, and be&s;t de&s;erves the care and protection of the legi&s;lature. To me, my Lords, whether they be mi&s;erable jobbers of Change Alley, or the lofty A&s;iatic plunderers of Leadenhall Street, they are all equally dete&s;table. I care but little whether a man walks on foot, or is drawn by eight hor&s;es, or by &s;ix hor&s;es; if his luxury be &s;upported by the plunder of his country, I de&s;pi&s;e and abhor him. My Lords, while I had the honour of &s;erving his Maje&s;ty, <HI>I never ventured to look at</HI> THE TREASURY, <HI>but from a di&s;tance;</HI> it is a bu&s;ine&s;s I am unfit for, and to which I never could have &s;ubmitted.

<P>This quarrel ended like others, in our di&s;appointment, and perhaps di&s;grace. Be&s;ides much expence and trouble to indi|viduals, the nation &s;quandered between three and four millions &s;terling. <HI>Quid vis in&s;ane?</HI></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The war of 1689 is at this day almo&s;t forgotten, in the blaze of more recent and &s;tupendous follies. Yet the pre&s;ent &s;hort &s;ketch of tho&s;e calamities which it produced, cannot fail of
<PB N="37" REF="028380_0038_0FD8DE991D24A1E0">
leading us into &s;ome melancholy reflections on the general ten|dency of the military &s;y&s;tem. War may produce advantage to a race of barbarians, who have nothing to do, and nothing to lo&s;e; but for a commercial nation, it can be no better than an alderman de&s;erting his ledger, to bet in a cock-pit. Of this &s;y&s;tem there is no part more injurious than that which enjoins the capture of merchant &s;hips. An hone&s;t mariner has by the labour of half his life earned a thou&s;and pounds, and embarks his whole property in a ve&s;&s;el freighted from Leith or Dunkirk. He is boarded by an enemy's privateer; his effects are for|feited; and he him&s;elf is to rot for &s;ix, or twelve, or eighteen months in a French or Engli&s;h jail; while his wife, his chil|dren, or perhaps his father&mdash;but this part of the picture becomes too &s;hocking for the contemplation of humanity. Of the&s;e matters, kings or courtiers almo&s;t never think. At a certain elevation, the human heart &s;eems to contract a <HI>fro&s;t</HI> more impe|netrable than the &s;ummit of the Alps or the Andes. It would be an au&s;picous event for mankind, if all the &s;hips of war in the world could be reduced to a&s;hes in one day.</P>
<P>We have adopted a fancy, that frequent ho&s;tilities are una|voidable. Yet the Swi&s;s, a nation of &s;oldiers, and placed in the mid&s;t of contending tyrants, have hardly been thrice at war in the cour&s;e of three centuries. The rea&s;on is, that their go|vernments are founded on wi&s;dom, benevolence, and integrity; while ours breathe only maxims of a le&s;s amiable nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The republics of Europe are all, and we may &s;ay always in peace.

<PB N="38" REF="028380_0039_0FD8DE9AA39CD628">
becomes the more remarkable, becau&s;e, at that time our an|ce&s;tors were fit for almo&s;t nothing el&s;e but fighting. The fatal conte&s;t that began in the end of the thirteenth century, &s;prung from the ambition of Edward the Fir&s;t. The re&s;pective na|tions lived in a profound peace, and were alike &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>From the year 1403, to the battle of Flodden, in 1513, be|ing a &s;pace of <HI>an hundred and ten years,</HI> peace was maintained between the two kingdoms, with very little interruption; though &s;ometimes there was a war which hardly la&s;ted above a &s;ingle campaign. During the long and bloody &s;truggle between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, the Scots interfered only once or twice at mo&s;t, and that was at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the Engli&s;h exiles; but they formed no ungenerous and im|practicable plans of conque&s;t. Even to Flodden they were driven by the temerity of their &s;overeign; and his fortunate death put an in&s;tant end to ho&s;tilities. Our ance&s;tors, whom we con&s;ider as barbarians, were unacquainted with the deliberate &s;y&s;tematic thir&s;t of blood which marks a modern politician; and what quarrels they had, aro&s;e from the folly of their &s;everal monarchs. We have not enjoyed ten years of peace together &s;ince the Revolution. Even when we cea&s;e to fight in Europe, a war mu&s;t immediately commence in A&s;ia, or Africa, or Ame|rica, and in the face of all this work, we call our&s;elves the hap|pie&s;t people in the world.</P>
<P>Peace may be con&s;idered as the univer&s;al parent of human happine&s;s. Indu&s;try cannot long thrive without it, and to this we are indebted for a great part of our comforts, our enjoy|ments, and our re&s;ources. Spain has long been envied for her gold and &s;ilver mines, which, by Dr. Robert&s;on's account, have in two centuries and a half, produced above two thou&s;and mil|lions &s;terling. But &s;ober indu&s;try is va&s;tly more valuable than all the mines in the world. If we can forbear butchery, we need not de&s;pair of di&s;charging every penny of our public debt, with ea&s;e, in le&s;s than a century; or if we &s;hould not, &s;till the property of the nation would increa&s;e with &s;uch rapidity, that the debt it&s;elf mu&s;t be hardly felt. To make this truth evi|dent,
<PB N="39" REF="028380_0040_0FD8DEBAE31D70E0">
let us attend to what follows. As a counterpart to the bubble of Falkland's I&s;lands, four millions &s;terling have lately been expended on a Spani&s;h convention. Had they been placed out at five <HI>per cent.</HI> of compound intere&s;t, they would in ninety-eight years have produced five hundred and twelve millions &s;terling, and at pre&s;ent one half of this latter &s;um would be more than &s;ufficient to di&s;charge all our incumbrances, and make us as free of debts as our grandfathers were when the Prince of Orange landed. It is true, that the job government of Britain cannot, like that of a Swi&s;s canton, place money at intere&s;t, but from calculations of this &s;ort, we may form a con|jecture, as to what we are capable of &s;aving, by con&s;idering what we have &s;pent. The American war alone added about one hundred and fifty millions to our public debt, and yet we are in reality a richer nation than when that war began <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ubject of national improvement, the reader may con&s;ult with advantage Dr. Campbell's Political Survey of Bri|tain; an E&s;timate of the Comparative Strength of Britain, dur|ing the pre&s;ent and two preceding reigns, by George Chalmers, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> and a continuation of this latter work, by the &s;ame ele|gant and profound writer, publi&s;hed about &s;ix months ago. Our pre&s;&s;es are groaning under controver&s;ial divinity, heraldy, blank ver&s;e, commentaries on Shake&s;peare, and every other imagin|able &s;pecies of non&s;en&s;e, while the books here referred to, have not in this country been honoured, as I am informed, with even a &s;econd edition.</NOTE>. Our funds, as we call them, have not hitherto recovered the &s;hock, but that is, in &s;pite of common prejudice, a happy circum&s;tance. Had THE YOUNG MAN been able to borrow money with equal facility as his father, we &s;hould certainly have been &s;courged into a Spani&s;h war. Now, though the country has recovered, and though our commerce is greatly &s;uperior to what it had ever before been, it is evident, that if we had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible vital principle of reproduction and accumu|lation, &s;o great a havock of property as an hundred and fifty, or even an hundred millions &s;terling, mu&s;t have reduced whole provinces of this i&s;land to a de&s;art. Such a complete recovery from the lo&s;s of more than an hundred millions in le&s;s than ten years, pre&s;ents us with a regular annual overplus of at lea&s;t &s;ix
<PB N="40" REF="028380_0041_0FD8DEA0F36F6390">
or eight millions. But that we may not over&s;hoot the mark, let us rate the clear annual profits of Briti&s;h commerce and agri|culture at only five millions. We &s;hall find that this yearly accumulation of &s;tocks with the legal compound intere&s;t only, amounts, in twenty-eight years, to three hundred millions. So that by a peace of twenty-eight years, we &s;hall become a more opulent nation, than we would be at this moment were all our debts paid off to the la&s;t farthing.</P>
<P>Before we call this pro&s;pect extravagant, let us con&s;ider what has actually happened. The mo&s;t &s;anguine projector, thirty years ago, would not have pre&s;umed to believe that four mil|lions &s;terling were by this time to be employed in extending and adorning a &s;ingle city in Scotland. Yet this progre&s;s of elegance continues to ri&s;e upon us like enchantment. Who in the la&s;t century would have &s;u&s;pected that by this time our North American colonies were to contain four millions of in|habitants? It mu&s;t be owned, that be&s;ides other evils, Gib|raltar, Canada, Nova Scotia, Botany Bay, the Ea&s;t India Com|pany, and the civil li&s;t, are a &s;ort of political mill&s;tones hang|ing at the neck of Briti&s;h pro&s;perity. Yet &s;uch are our re|&s;ources, that if we chu&s;e to de&s;i&s;t from the war &s;y&s;tem, our wealth mu&s;t in the cour&s;e of fifty years extend beyond all cal|culation. Mr. Fox, if providence &s;hall continue to ble&s;s us with his abilities till that period, will not then have the &s;malle&s;t difficulty in obtaining a pen&s;ion of forty thou&s;and pounds a year for every de&s;cendant of the royal family. Three ungrateful nations will then cea&s;e to affirm, that for his conduct in a cer|tain debate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Vide</HI> his &s;peeches in parliament on the &s;ettlement of the Duke of York. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the clerk of a counting-hou&s;e were to lo&s;e at the gaming-table a thou&s;and pounds of his ma&s;ter's money, or even of his own, he would be di&s;charged as unworthy of tru&s;t. There is a man, who is &s;aid to have lo&s;t five hundred thou&s;and pounds in that way, and when he had thus reduced him&s;elf to bankruptcy, we have &s;een him pre&s;erved to the management of an annual revenue of &s;ixteen millions &s;terling. It is difficult to conceive a more gigantic in&s;tance of &s;tupidity and depravity than &s;uch a choice. That a Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould adopt a mi|ni&s;ter of this &s;ort, is quite <HI>in character;</HI> but that individuals, who have the happine&s;s of their country at heart, &s;hould applaud &s;uch a &s;election, mu&s;t fill every &s;ober man with a&s;toni&s;hment.

<P>CHARLES the Second King of Spain had no children; he was of declining years, and a feeble con&s;titution. There were three candidates for the inheritance of his dominions, the Emperor, the Dauphin of France, and the Electoral Prince of Bavaria. The Emperor claimed right as male repre&s;entative

to the family of Au&s;tria. Philip the Fourth, predece&s;&s;or and father to Charles, had left behind him two daughters by dif|ferent marriages. The elde&s;t was mother to the Dauphin; the younge&s;t had e&s;pou&s;ed the Emperor, and their daughter, an only &s;urviving child, had been married to the Elector of Bavaria, to whom &s;he had born that Prince who was at pre&s;ent a candidate. It &s;eems that the Dauphin of France, as de&s;cending from the elde&s;t daughter of Phillip the Fourth, had the neare&s;t right; but as the other nations of Europe were extremly jealous of France, it was early fore&s;een that the Dauphin's claim would meet with a dangerous oppo&s;ition. On the 1&s;t of October 1698, the King of France, the King of England, and the Republic of Holland, engaged in a contract as to this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Their bargain was, that the Dauphin &s;hould &s;ucceed to the kingdoms of Naples and Sicilly, and a certain portion of the provinces of Spain it&s;elf. The other two candidates were to &s;hare the re&s;t of the domi|nions, and this agreement hath &s;ince been called the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> treaty of partition. So va&s;t an acce&s;&s;ion of territory would have ren|dered France a mo&s;t formidable neighbour to the Dutch, and on their part the treaty &s;eems to have been an act of imprudence. The &s;ecret of this combination having come to light, Charles in a rage in&s;tantly made a te&s;tament, by which he transferred the whole dominions of Spain, to the young Prince of Bavaria. But as the latter died &s;oon after, he made a &s;econd will, by which he bequeathed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, al&s;o entire, to the Arch|duke Charles, the Emperor's &s;econd &s;on, by a marriage which he had entered into after the death of his Spani&s;h empre&s;s. The former parties, on the 14th March 1700, engaged in a <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> treaty of partition, by which the Dauphin was to receive a large addition to his &s;hare, and the remainder was re&s;erved for the Emperor. This tran&s;action al&s;o reached Charles, before it was clo&s;ed; and in Augu&s;t 1699, his amba&s;&s;ador at London de|livered to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try an intere&s;ting appeal on the con|duct of William. He remarked, that if &s;uch proceedings were allowed, no people, no dominion could be &s;afe again&s;t the am|bition of the &s;tronge&s;t, and the deceits of the mo&s;t malicious; that &s;hould &s;trangers be &s;uffered to put their hands into the lines

of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings, no &s;tatutes, no municipal laws would be ob&s;erved; that no crown could be free from the attempts of aliens; and the crown of England le&s;s than any crown; and that were men to lie watching for the &s;ickne&s;s of &s;overeigns, no health could be con&s;tant, and no life &s;ecure. He al&s;o reminded them, that the expences of a war, and the de&s;truction of com|merce, mu&s;t be the certain con&s;equence of &s;uch adventures.</P>
<P>For this hone&s;t production, the amba&s;&s;ador was forced to leave England. On the 2d of October 1700, the King of Spain, by the advice of the Pope, made a third te&s;tament. To put an end to all projects of a partition, he left the whole em|pire, undivided, to the Duke of Anjou, the &s;econd &s;on of the Dauphin of France, and grand&s;on to Lewis the Fourteenth. By this choice, he attempted to avert the calamities of a di&s;|puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. For as the Duke of Anjou was not heir to the crown of France, that circum&s;tance removed the objection of making a hazardous augmentation to the French domini|ons. This mea&s;ure was more &s;imble, ju&s;t, and practicable, than that adopted by William and the Dutch. On the 25th No|vember 1700, Charles died; and though he bequeathed &s;uch a &s;plendid legacy to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, he had been one of William's allies in his la&s;t long and bloody war again&s;t France; a fact which evinces the mutability of the political world.</P>
<P>On the death of their &s;overeign, the Spani&s;h nation deter|mined that a con&s;piracy of foreigners &s;hould not be &s;uffered to partition their provinces. They di&s;patched a courier to the court of France with the te&s;tament of their late &s;overeign, and if Lewis &s;hould refu&s;e to accept the monarchy for his grand|&s;on, they gave him orders to proceed to Vienna, and make an offer of the univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Archduke. Thus Lewis had his choice of two mea&s;ures. If he accepted the te&s;tament of Charles, his grand&s;on was at once, and without oppo&s;ition, put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h dominions, at the hazard of a quarrel with the Dutch and England. If he refu&s;ed this offer, the Au&s;trian Archduke was with equal certainty to a&s;cend the throne, and Lewis was to depend on the very doubtful friend|&s;hip of his old enemies, the Dutch and England, for their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> conquer a &s;hare of Spain, in oppo&s;ition to the Emperor and that nation. But as Lewis him&s;elf was feared and hated both in Holland and England, there is not the lea&s;t probability, that he would have obtained any &s;erious aid in his preten&s;ions, from the&s;e two countries. We cannot therefore with rea&s;on condemn him, when he accepted for the Duke of Anjou the offer of the Spani&s;h crown. The reader is reque&s;ted to pay par|ticular attention to this conci&s;e and candid &s;tate of the ca&s;e; for even at pre&s;ent, it is the vulgar opinion that Lewis acted upon this occa&s;ion with treachery. It would be more proper to &s;ay, that William engaged in an enterpri&s;e far above his power, and that he &s;hewed an utter indifference to the intere&s;t of his kingdoms. The preference which the Spani&s;h nation be|&s;towed upon the Duke of Anjou, was in the moral &s;en&s;e an am|ple vindication of the acceptance of Lewis. If there be &s;uch a thing as equity upon earth, it mu&s;t begin with this maxim, that a people are at all times entitled to their choice of a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the 17th of April 1701, William acknowledged the Duke of Anjou, as the lawful &s;overeign of Spain, by a letter under his own hand. The Dutch al&s;o recognized his right. On the 7th of September thereafter, William, with his wonted con&s;i&s;t|ency, entered into an alliance with the Emperor and Holland to attack the young monarch. The de&s;ign avowed in the ar|ticles was, to obtain the Dutchy of Milan from the crown of Spain, as a compen&s;ation to the Emperor; and Flanders, or part of it, as a barrier for Holland. What England was to ob|tain, we are not informed. On the 6th of September 1701, James the Second expired, and Lewis, on his death, acknow|ledged his &s;on as King of England. Though this was but an empty form, William employed it as a pretence to &s;educe the nation into a &s;econd war. His project was embraced with exul|tation by all parties.</P>
<P>Yet though Lewis was to blame, we our&s;elves had behaved but little better. Our a&s;&s;umed title as <HI>King of France,</HI> is not only a di&s;honourable untruth, but a wanton in&s;ult to a re&s;pectable people. William prepared for a campaign, but happily both

In this la&s;t work, William is every where repre&s;ented as a virtuous and &s;ublime character. The &s;tory of the Counte&s;s of Orkney, and the trite cata&s;trophe of Darien, with many others of the &s;ame &s;ort, are completely explained away. The partition treaties are de|fended, as pregnant with future ble&s;&s;ings to England; for the hi&s;torian &s;eems to fancy that the Allies could have divided the provinces of Spain, with the exactne&s;s and tranquillity of a grocer cutting a pound of chee&s;e.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to publi&s;h from more honourable motives, or to atte&s;t a more important truth.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before we enter into the events of this war, it may not be improper to illu&s;trate, by an exact and intere&s;ting parallel, what Dr. Swift calls "our <HI>infamous</HI> treaty of partition." Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that for &s;ome years before the death of Queen Eliza|beth, all Europe had fore&s;een that &s;he was to die childle&s;s, that James the Sixth of Scotland was to be her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and that by &s;uch an increa&s;e of dominion, England was to en&s;ure a deci&s;ive addition of power and importance. "No," exclaimed the Dutch, the French, and the Au&s;trians, <Q>WE cannot, Elizabeth, permit you and your people to chu&s;e a &s;overeign for Eng|land. We all know that <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Henry the Fourth of France u&s;ed to call him &s;o.</NOTE> James is a fool. He has married a daughter of the King of Denmark; and hence the Briti&s;h Empire would become but a province to the court of Copenhagen. We have formed a much better plan, and you mu&s;t adopt it. Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, and Plymouth, Dover ca&s;tle, and the county of Kent, are to compo&s;e a frontier in the hands of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. The

To Ireland you never had any title but that of a robber, and as you are dete&s;ted by the whole nation, to the very la&s;t man, it is nece&s;&s;ary, for pre&s;erving <HI>the balance of power,</HI> to declare them independent. As for the re&s;t of your dominions, we have brought you a GERMAN ma&s;ter, born at the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles, a &s;tranger to your country, your laws, your manners, and your language. In defence of <HI>his</HI> RIGHT, we have di&s;em|barked on the coa&s;t of York&s;hire two hundred thou&s;and armed ru&s;&s;ians; and unle&s;s you in&s;tantly acknowledge him as &s;ucce&s;&s;or, we &s;hall &s;pread de&s;olation from Caithne&s;s to the land's end. If his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty declines to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in overwhelming his &s;on-in-law, our admirals have orders to beat Copenhagen about his ears.

<P>On the 4th of May 1702, ho&s;tilities were declared again&s;t Spain. "We ha&s;tily engaged in a war," &s;ays Swift, <Q>which hath co&s;t us SIXTY MILLIONS, and after repeated, as well as <HI>unexpected</HI> &s;ucce&s;s in arms, hath put us and our po&s;terity in a wor&s;e condition, not only than any of our allies, but than even <HI>our conquered enemies them&s;elves</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Conduct of the Allies.

Yet had he outlived Anne, twenty thou&s;and nece&s;&s;itous families mu&s;t each have paid five pounds a year of their pittance to &s;upport him. And this &s;ingle impo&s;ition would, while it la&s;ted, have comprehended more &s;ub&s;tantial inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion than all the other thefts and robberies in the country.</P>
<P>In September 1703, Charles, the &s;econd &s;on of the Emperor Leopold, was declared King of Spain, and as &s;uch, was acknow|ledged by all the Allies, including the Dutch and England, who had both formerly recognized the title of the French Prince. It is needle&s;s to expatiate on the ju&s;tice or decency of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. In Augu&s;t 1704, Marlborough won the battle of Blenheim. In October 1706 Lewis offered better terms of pacification <HI>than were afterwards excepted.</HI> With what pro|priety then are we to blame <HI>his</HI> ambition? "The Whigs," &s;ays Mr. Macpher&s;on, <Q>who were now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole power of government in England, <HI>in&s;ulted common &s;en&s;e,</HI> in the rea&s;on which they gave for rejecting the propo&s;ed peace. They &s;aid, that the terms offered by France were TOO GOOD, to be the foundation for a la&s;ting tranquillity, and therefore they ought not be admitted.</Q>&mdash;Had Lewis engaged to re&s;tore Normandy to England, that, upon <HI>Whig</HI> principles, would have been a &s;till better rea&s;on for refu&s;ing an agreement. Such were the political heroes who&s;e <HI>virtues</HI> we vaunt of adopt|ing, and by whom Europe was condemned to remain for &s;ix years and five months longer, a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, di&s;tre&s;s, and carnage! This in&s;olence very &s;oon met with its reward. On the 25th of April 1707, an entire <HI>Whig</HI> army was di&s;per&s;ed, taken, or extirpated, at Almanza, by the Duke of Berwick. Sixteen thou&s;and of the vanqui&s;hed were killed or made pri|&s;oners. In this campaign, the Duke of Marlborough atchieved nothing worthy of his former fame. Prince Eugene, with forty

thou&s;and men, invaded Provence, and inve&s;ted Toulon. His forces were in danger of being &s;urrounded, and his e&s;cape or flight was marked with the u&s;ual and heroic circum&s;tances of &s;laughter and deva&s;tation. Four Engli&s;h men of war, with Ad|miral Shovel, a per&s;on who&s;e abilities had rai&s;ed him from the rank of a common &s;ailor, foundered on the rocks of Scilly. In &s;hort, the di&s;a&s;ters of the Allies were &s;o numerous and &s;evere, that Lewis might at this time have turned the cha&s;e, if his coun&s;els had not been governed by an old woman. The Scots, by a bargain &s;ufficiently que&s;tionable had been <HI>united</HI> with England. The whole nation were inflamed into a degree of madne&s;s. The Pretender's birth day was publicly celebrated at Edinburgh; and a memorial was tran&s;mitted to France by a number of nobility and gentry, who promi&s;ed to embody in his favour five thou&s;and hor&s;e and twenty-five thou&s;and foot. The propo&s;al was rejected. In 1708, the Allies were more &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and among other ble&s;&s;ed events, they gained Li&s;le, with the lo&s;s of eighteen or twenty thou&s;and men. For what no|table purpo&s;es have we dragged the &s;mith from his anvil, and the farmer from his plow! In 1709, the Government bor|rowed from the Bank of England four hundred thou&s;and pounds, at &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> be&s;ides granting them &s;everal advantages, which may have rai&s;ed the real intere&s;t to ten or twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> and all this for the plea&s;ure of making a German King of Spain. The practice of advancing money to the public was at that time, and has been ever &s;ince, a very profitable traffick to tho&s;e gentlemen of whom Lord Chatham has made &s;uch honourable mention. Lewis, in the beginning of this year, had renewed his offers of peace. He attempted, as Torcy relates, to bribe the Duke of Marlborough, by a condi|tional pre&s;ent of four millions of livres; but his Grace, after due con&s;ideration, declined the propo&s;al.

On the 10th of September 1709, the&s;e conferences were &s;ucceeded by the victory of Malplaquet, which Marlborough purcha&s;ed with the lives of twenty thou&s;and men, while the French, though <HI>defeated;</HI> left but eight thou&s;and dead on the field.</P>
<P>In 1710, Lewis made fre&s;h offers of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. <Q>He pro|mi&s;ed even a &s;ub&s;idy of a million of livres monthly to the Allies, till King Philip <HI>&s;hould be driven out of Spain</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 7.</NOTE>.</Q> But mark what follows:&mdash;They required that Lewis &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t them <HI>with all his forces,</HI> to expel his grand&s;on from the throne of that kingdom.

A ring of chairmen would be a&s;hamed of &s;uch con&s;ummate barbarity. Whether Lewis would have &s;ubmitted to this la&s;t act of degra|dation is doubtful, for Eugene and Marlborough ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of explanation, and commenced the campaign.&mdash; <Q>They gained three places of importance, and conquered twelve leagues of a fine country.

A circum&s;tance in it&s;elf trifling contributed to this event; and the friends of mankind mu&s;t acknowledge, that for once at lea&s;t, public happine&s;s has been promoted by public &s;uper&s;tition.

Harley, the new mini&s;ter, and his a&s;&s;ociates, had too much &s;en&s;e to di&s;cover abruptly their de&s;igns to the people. The &s;um of fourteen mil|lions five hundred and &s;eventy-three thou&s;and, three hundred and nineteen pounds, nineteen &s;hillings and eight pence half-penny, was voted to di&s;charge the arrears in the navy and other offices, and the &s;ervices of the current year. At this critical moment, a &s;econd &s;troke of fortune advanced the pacific views of the Tories.

<P>The campaign of 1711, elap&s;ed without effort on either &s;ide. The &s;urrender of Bouchain on the 13th of September, clo&s;ed the military exploits of the Duke of Marlborough. The new mini&s;ter of England had been engaged in attempting to re|concile the demands of the contending powers. But the States of Holland were &s;o much exa&s;perated by the conduct of Queen Anne, that they were at no pains in concealing their de&s;ign to treat her as they had treated her father. They propo&s;ed <Q>to fit out a fleet to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Elector of Hanover to &s;trike the &s;ceptre from her hand <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> On the 7th of December, parlia|ment met. Harley had &s;ecured a Tory majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons; but his party was &s;omewhat inferior in the Hou&s;e of Peers. Affairs had now come to a cri&s;is. The leaders of the Whigs were &s;u&s;pected of intending an immediate appeal to arms. It became therefore nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s the Duke of Marlborough from his military command; and on the la&s;t day of December, Harley produced what is now called <HI>a batch of peers.</HI> Twelve gentlemen devoted to the court were created members of the Upper Hou&s;e. Anne had the very &s;ame right to have created twelve thou&s;and. The con&s;titution of Britain, like the &s;word of Diony&s;ius, hangs by a &s;ingle hair.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January 1712, Mr. Walpole was committed to the Tower. He had received five hundred guineas, and a note for five hundred more, for two contracts when &s;ecretary at war, for &s;upplying the forces in Scotland with forage. <Q>A member, &s;ays Burnet, who was a Whig, was expelled the Hou&s;e; and a pro&s;ecution was ordered again&s;t him:&mdash;but <HI>the abu&s;e goes on &s;till, as avowedly as ever.</HI></Q> The Duke of Marlborough's conduct underwent a &s;evere cen&s;ure, and Car|donnel,
<PB N="53" REF="028380_0054_0FD8DEC91CE4D1F0">
his &s;ecretary, was expelled by the Commons. The campaign of 1712 was unfortunate on the part of the Allies. The Briti&s;h forces under the command of the Duke of Ormond remained inactive; and even the ab&s;ence of the abilities of Marl|borough &s;eems to have been &s;everely felt. The peace was not finally &s;ettled till March 1713. The Whig faction, to their eternal infamy, &s;trained every nerve to prevent it. By this peace, be&s;ides the i&s;lands of Minorca and St. Chri&s;topher's, and the fortre&s;s of Gibraltar, for our&s;elves, we obtained the i&s;land of Sicily for the Duke of Savoy, which produced the Spani&s;h war in 1718, a partial right for our merchants of trading to South America, which began the Spani&s;h war of 1739, and Nova Scotia, which gave ri&s;e to the French war in 1756. This war was more de&s;tructive than that of 1689, as it la&s;ted for eleven campaigns. Dr. Swift computes that each of them co&s;t us &s;ix or &s;even millions &s;terling. The lo&s;s of lives and of &s;hipping could be hardly, if at all inferior to that of the former war, as our battles were numerous, and as the protection of our commerce was altogether neglected. In a word, the nation &s;quandered &s;eventy or eighty millions, that Marlborough might pilfer <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>To Dr. Swift we are much indebted for the termination of this war. His pamphlet on <HI>The Conduct of the Allies,</HI> excited a &s;ort of political earthquake, and more than all his admirable ver&s;es mu&s;t endear him to di&s;tant po&s;terity. A few pa&s;&s;ages may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t. "It will appear," &s;ays he, <Q>by plain matters of fact, that no nation was ever &s;o long, or &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly abu&s;ed, by the folly, the temerity, the corruption, and the ambition of its dome&s;tic enemies; or treated with &s;o much in&s;olence, inju&s;tice, and ingratitude, by its foreign friends.&mdash;We are de&s;troying many thou&s;and lives, and exhau&s;ting our &s;ub&s;tance, not for our own intere&s;t, which would be but common prudence; not for a thing indifferent, which would be &s;ufficient folly; but perhaps to our own de|&s;truction, which is perfect madne&s;s.&mdash;The common que&s;tion is, if we mu&s;t now &s;urrender Spain, what have we been fight|ing for all this while? The an&s;wer is ready. We have been fighting for the ruin of the public intere&s;t, and the advance|ment

of a private. We have been fighting to rai&s;e the wealth and grandeur of a particular family;</Q> (that of Marl|borough,) <Q>to enrich u&s;urers and &s;tockjobbers, and to culti|vate the pernicious de&s;igns of a faction, by de&s;troying the landed intere&s;t.&mdash;Since the monied men are &s;o fond of war, I &s;hould be glad if they would furni&s;h out one campaign <HI>at their own charge.</HI> It is not above &s;ix or &s;even millions; and I dare engage to make it out, that, <HI>when they have done this,</HI> in&s;tead of contributing equal to the landed men, they will have their full principal and intere&s;t at &s;ix <HI>per cent.</HI> remaining of all the money they ever lent to the government.</Q></P>
<P>Even at this day, we are deafened about the glorious victories of the Duke of Marlborough, and though by the death of the Emperor Jo&s;eph, the object of di&s;pute was utterly extingui&s;hed, a crowd of authors per&s;i&s;t in lamenting that our commander was checked in the career of pillage and butchery. Happy might it have been for this country, had Marlborough, with all his forces, peri&s;hed on the field of Blenheim; &s;ince it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch a &s;troke would at once have bla&s;ted our cru&s;ades upon the continent. As if his Grace had not enjoyed &s;ufficient opportunities of plundering the trea&s;ury of the nation, as if the manor of Wood&s;tock, the palace of Blenheim <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Swift e&s;timates Wood&s;tock at forty thou&s;and pounds, and adds, that Blenheim Hou&s;e had co&s;t two hundred thou&s;and pounds, and was at the time of his writing <HI>unfini&s;hed.</HI> There can be no wonder, that we mu&s;t now pay nine-pence per pound of importation duty for Peruvian bark, and three guineas for leave to &s;hoot a partriage worth two-pence.</NOTE>, and an hundred thou&s;and pounds a year <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;um has been &s;tated higher, but &s;uch computations are always in part random.</NOTE>, had not been adequate to the &s;ervices of him&s;elf and his Duche&s;s, we are &s;addled with as annual payment of five thou&s;and pounds to his family for ever. When a con&s;titution, de&s;erving that name, &s;hall &s;ucceed our pre&s;ent political anarchy, it is not difficult to fore&s;ee &s;ome of the fir&s;t objects of reformation. The Earl of Chatham en|joys four thou&s;and pounds a year, becau&s;e his father added &s;e|venty millions to the national debt. The Duke of Richmond rai&s;es from the city of London an annual revenue, &s;aid to be

twenty thou&s;and pounds, becau&s;e he is de&s;cended from the &s;on of a criminal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles II.</NOTE>, who de&s;erved an hundred times over to have been &s;togged out of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As a commentary on the preceding narrative, we may con|&s;ult a quotation from Dr. John&s;on's pamphlet on Falkland's i&s;lands. The reflections which it contains have more than once extorted, in my hearing, the admiration of the late Dr. Adam Smith, who was far from being a general advocate for this Au|thor.</P>
<P><Q>It is wonderful, with what coolne&s;s and indifference the greater part of mankind &s;ee war commenced. Tho&s;e who hear of it at a di&s;tance, or read of it in books, but have never pre&s;ented its evils to their minds, con&s;ider it as little more than a &s;plendid gaine, a proclamation, an army, a battle, and a triumph. Some indeed mu&s;t peri&s;h in the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful field, but they die upon the bed of honour, <HI>re&s;ign their lives amid&s;t the joys of conque&s;t, and, filled with England's glory, &s;mile in death.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The life of a modern &s;oldier is ill repre&s;ented by heroic fiction. War has means of de&s;truction more formidable than the cannon and the &s;word. Of the thou&s;ands and ten thou|&s;ands who peri&s;hed in our late conte&s;ts with France and Spain, a very &s;mall part ever felt the &s;troke of an enemy; the re&s;t langui&s;hed in tents and &s;hips, amid&s;t damps and putrefaction; pale, torpid, &s;piritle&s;s, and helple&s;s; ga&s;ping and groaning, unpitied among men, made obdurate by a long continuance of hopele&s;s mi&s;ery; and were at la&s;t whelmed in pits, or heaved into the ocean, without notice, and without remem|brance. By incommodious encampments, and unwhole&s;ome &s;tations, where courage is u&s;ele&s;s, and enterpri&s;e impractica|ble, fleets are &s;ilently di&s;peopled <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The manning of a fleet has often produced almo&s;t as much mi&s;chief as its <HI>depopulation.</HI> On this &s;ubject there is here &s;ubjoin|ed a &s;hort but &s;hocking &s;tory, which happened about the time when Dr. John&s;on's pamphlet was fir&s;t printed, and which can harbly be regarded as a digre&s;&s;ion, &s;ince it reflects additional hor|ror on the war &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>A workman, in London, was apprehended by a pre&s;s gang. His wife and child were turned to the door by their landlord. Within a few days after &s;he was delivered of a &s;econd child in a garret. On her recovery, &s;he was driven to the &s;treets as a common beggar. She went into a &s;hop, and attempted to carry off a &s;mall piece of linen. She was &s;eized, tried, and condemned to be hanged. In her defence &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he had lived creditably and happy, till a pre&s;s gang robbed her of her hu&s;band, and in him, of all means to &s;upport her&s;elf and her family; and that in attempting to clothe her new born infant, &s;he perhaps did wrong, as &s;he did not, at that time, know what &s;he did. The pari&s;h officers, and other witne&s;&s;es, bore te&s;ti|mony to the truth of her averment, but all to no purpo&s;e. &s;he was ordered for Tyburn. <HI>The hangman dragged her &s;ucking in|fant from her brea&s;t, when he &s;trained the cord about her neck.</HI> On the 13th May 1777, Sir William Meredith mentioned this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in the Hou&s;e of Commons. <Q>Never, &s;aid he, was there a fouler murder committed again&s;t the law, than that of this woman by the law.</Q>&mdash;Such were the fruits of what Engli&s;hmen call <HI>their ine&s;timable privilege of a trial by jury.</HI></P>
<P>It would not be difficult to fill a large volume with deci&s;ions of this &s;tamp, though there is not perhaps any &s;ingle ca&s;e, which is in all its circum&s;tances &s;o ab&s;olutely infernal. The reader may compare the <HI>guilt,</HI> as it was termed, of Mary Jones, with the progre&s;s of tho&s;e <HI>noble patriots,</HI> who&s;e hi&s;tory is recorded in the next chapter, and who are at this day held up as the &s;a|viours of Britain, and then &s;ay which of the two parties be&s;t de|&s;erved a halter.</P>
<P>General Gunning, a man who is not worth a &s;hilling, was lately fined in five thou&s;and pounds for &s;educing a doxy who was as forward as him&s;elf; and Mr. Tatter&s;al, the editor of a London new&s;paper his ju&s;t now been fined in four thou&s;and pounds for a paragraph which a&s;&s;erted, that a lady had an amour with her footman. It was proved that Mr. Tatter&s;al was at a great di&s;tance from London, when this &s;tory was print|ed; and con&s;equently, that had it been even a forgery on the Bank of England, the law could not have touched a hair of his head. There can be no doubt that the lady will accept the la&s;t farthing a&s;&s;igned by this verdict, and &s;uch an acceptance can leave no &s;triking impre&s;&s;ion of female genero&s;ity.

<P>Some years ago, Mr. Cooper, of London, was accu&s;ed of being the printer and publi&s;her of a performance deemed a libel.

Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e circum&s;tances, a Middle&s;ex jury found him guilty; and, as &s;oon as he had recovered from his &s;ickne&s;s, he was placed on the pillory, and, no doubt, would have been pelted by mini&s;terial hirlings, had not a number of re&s;pectable gentlemen prevented it by their per&s;onal attendance.&mdash;So much for the liberty of the pre&s;s, when protected by a Middle&s;ex jury.</P></NOTE>, and armies &s;luggi&s;hly melted away.</Q></P>

<P>THERE is not in hi&s;tory a more &s;ignal example of ingrati|tude, than the conduct of the Emperor, the Dutch, and Marlborough, to the Queen of England. She had fought for ten years the battles of her Allies. She had advanced her ge|neral to be the fir&s;t &s;ubject in Europe. When &s;he refu&s;ed to complete the ruin of her country for the caprice of the former, when the in&s;olence of the latter compelled her to di&s;mi&s;s him, loaded with the plunder of nations, from her pre&s;ence, the&s;e worthy a&s;&s;ociates con&s;pired for the de&s;truction of their bene|factre&s;s. It is not certain that William him&s;elf had ever pro|ceeded into &s;uch a climax of ba&s;ene&s;s. Though his partition treaties were ab&s;urd in a Briti&s;h &s;overeign, we may forgive, in his ho&s;tilities with Lewis, the re&s;entment of a Dutchman. When we peru&s;e the plan of Eugene for &s;etting fire to the &s;treets of London, and the palace of St. James's <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. 2, chap. 9.</NOTE>, even his tran&s;cendant behaviour at the Revolution almo&s;t fades before it.</P>
<P>By the prudence and firmne&s;s of Harley, the plots of Eugene were di&s;covered and di&s;appointed; and on the 17th of March 1712, he was obliged to embark with &s;ome precipitation for the Continent. The neutrality of the Engli&s;h forces in the next campaign, with the final termination of the war, has al|ready been mentioned. It does not appear that the Elector of Hanover was engaged in the &s;cheme of dethroning Anne. His

beggarly condition may have contributed to the moderation of his &s;entiments. In 1713, he &s;olicited from the Engli&s;h Crown a pen&s;ion for his mother the Prince&s;s Sophia. <Q>In the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of his affairs, a fre&s;h &s;upply of revenue was much wanted.

But the facts which he has advanced are unque&s;tionably true. The original corre&s;pondence of the parties is &s;till extant in their own hand writing. Let us proceed, therefore, with a few far|ther extracts from this authentic and in&s;tructive author. <Q>A propo&s;al made by the Baron de Bern&s;torff, Pre&s;ident of the Elector's Council, was received by Marlborough and Cado|gan with eagerne&s;s and joy. He in&s;inuated, that his Electoral Highne&s;s might be induced to borrow to the extent of <HI>twenty thou&s;and pounds</HI> from his friends in Britain. This &s;um was to be laid out on the <HI>poor Lords,</HI> and <HI>the Common Council of London,</HI> during the three years the parliament was to &s;it. The fir&s;t would be thus enabled to vote according to their <HI>principles;</HI> the latter might ply the Government, and hara&s;s the Queen and her mini&s;ters with remon&s;trances in favour of civil liberty and <HI>the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HI> Marlborough and Cadogan undertook to furni&s;h the money on the obligation of his Electoral Highne&s;s, provided the intere&s;t of five <HI>per cent. &s;hould be regularly paid.</HI> But his Highne&s;s would give no obligation either for the principal or intere&s;t. He how|ever &s;ignified to his agents, that his friends &s;hould advance the money, as they might be certain of being reimbur&s;ed as &s;oon as his Highne&s;s, or the Electre&s;s his mother, &s;hould come to the throne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 10.</NOTE>." It does not appear that his friends cho&s;e to advance their money on this promi&s;e.</Q> On the 20th of March 1714, George made an&s;wer to &s;ome fre&s;h demands <Q>of money for poor Lords, Common Councils, bribery of members, and private pen&s;ions, that <HI>he would hear</HI> NO MORE OF THAT AFFAIR. That, from the narrowne&s;s of his own income, he could not enter upon the&s;e heads, into any com|petition with his antagoni&s;t, the Lord Trea&s;urer. But that, <HI>except in the article of expences,</HI> he was willing to &s;upport, to the utmo&s;t, their party <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q> It would be idle to &s;uppo&s;e that one part of the i&s;land was le&s;s corrupted than another. In July 1713, <Q>the Duke of Argyle told Halifax, that <HI>with twenty thou&s;and pounds,</HI> he would an&s;wer for all the elections in

<P>Nothing is more &s;urpri&s;ing, than the inaccuracy which abounds in many, even of our be&s;t hi&s;torians. There cannot be &s;tronger proofs imagined of the corruption of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, than what have been ju&s;t now produced. Yet, with this blaze of evidence before his eyes, the writer of the Memoirs of Britain has advanced a very &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash; When &s;peaking of Mr. Duncombe's acquittal in the Hou&s;e of Peers, in 1695, he adds, <Q>For the honour of the Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>this is the only in&s;tance in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory,</HI> in which the di&s;tribution of private money was &s;u&s;pected to have had influence with a number of Peers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Britain, vol. ii. part 3d, Book iv.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;uch a &s;pecimen of the hone&s;ty of the Whigs it would be unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate all the other methods which they fell upon to embara&s;s their unfortunate Queen. One of their &s;chemes was, to bring over the Elector Prince, under the title of the Duke of Cambridge, as a head to their party. But un|luckily this project was equally di&s;agreeable to the Elector of Hanover and to the Queen. In a letter to George, dated 30th May 1714, <Q>I am determined," &s;ays Anne, "to oppo&s;e a project &s;o contrary to my royal authority, however fatal the con&s;equences may be <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">State Papers, vol. ii. p. 621.</NOTE>.</Q> And George him&s;elf ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed every propo&s;al of this kind. <Q>His refu&s;al was &s;o peremp|tory, that the Whigs, and even his &s;ervants, made no &s;cruple of a&s;cribing his conduct to <HI>a jealou&s;y of his own &s;on</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 10.</NOTE>.</Q> It has been &s;aid, a thou&s;and times over, that George the Fir&s;t en|tertained the mo&s;t violent &s;u&s;picion as to the legitimacy of his
<PB N="64" REF="028380_0065_0FD8DEE95E93FCD8">
&s;on; and that his jealou&s;y was fatal to the life of a Swedi&s;h no|bleman. His wife, the Prince&s;s of Zell, was at this very time in confinement for her amours; and in this &s;ituation the unhappy woman died, after a melancholy captivity of thirty-&s;ix years.</P>
<P>Another mode&s;t contrivance to hara&s;s the Queen, de&s;erves peculiar notice. On the 8th of April 1714, <Q>it was propo&s;ed to reque&s;t her Maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, &s;etting a price <HI>on her brother's head.</HI> The Tory Lords repre&s;ented, that the motion was as incon&s;i&s;tent with common humanity, as it was repugnant to the Chri&s;tian religion; that to &s;et a price on any man's head, was to encourage a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination by public au|thority; and that &s;hould ever the ca&s;e come before them, as peers and judges, they would think them&s;elves bound, in ju&s;tice, honour, and con&s;cience, to condemn &s;uch an action as murther. The Whigs <HI>argued upon the ground of</HI> EXPEDI|ENCY <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on, vol. ii. chap. 10.</NOTE>.</Q> The motion was rejected.</P>
<P>The Whigs did not always confine their operations to bribery. We may comprehend from what follows, the genuine character of &s;ome of their principal leaders. In 1694, William planned an expedition again&s;t Bre&s;t. The particulars were betrayed to James the Second, in a letter from Marlborough, where he com|plains that Admiral Ru&s;&s;el was not &s;ufficiently hearty in the cau&s;e of the exiled. In con&s;equence of this act of treachery, the Engli&s;h forces were repul&s;ed on their landing at Bre&s;t. Six hundred were &s;lain, and many wounded; one Dutch frigate was &s;unk after lo&s;ing almo&s;t her whole crew. Another example may &s;erve to &s;how the character of there leaders in a proper light. In 1695, Sir John Fenwick, a Major-General, had been engaged with Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, and others, in a project for a rebellion in England, and had, on its di&s;|covery, fled. Some time after he returned, was found out, and arre&s;ted. To &s;ave his life, he tran&s;mitted to the King an ac|count of the trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence of Godolphin, Marl|borough, Ru&s;&s;el, and many other <HI>Whigs of di&s;tinction</HI> with James. His accu&s;ation <Q>is now known to have been in all

points true;</Q> and as there was only one evidence again&s;t him, <Q>he could not be convicted in <HI>a court of law,</HI> which re|quired two." But the per&s;ons whom he had accu&s;ed, "be|lieved that they could not be &s;afe <HI>as long as he lived.</HI></Q> A bill of attainder was therefore brought in again&s;t him, and Ru&s;&s;el appeared at the head of the pro&s;ecution. The &s;equel produced a crowd of proceedings <Q>which exceeded the inju&s;|tice of the wor&s;t precedents in the wor&s;t times of Charles the Second and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or;</Q> and the whole were vindicated by Burnet, in a long &s;peech. The bill pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es by a nar|row majority; and on the 28th of January 1696, Fenwick was beheaded on Tower-hill, <HI>"without evidence or law."</HI> Lady Fenwick attempted to bribe a per&s;on who&s;e te&s;timony &s;he dreaded, to fly the kingdom. The accu&s;ers prevailed on this wretch to place people behind a curtain to overhear the offer; <Q>and this attempt of a wife to &s;ave her hu&s;band's life from dan|ger, <HI>was turned into an evidence of his guilt</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Britain, vol. ii. part 3. book 7.</NOTE>.</Q> The&s;e are the words of a hi&s;torian, who is him&s;elf a profe&s;&s;ed Whig, who has been a lawer, and is now a Judge. It is difficult to &s;ay, whe|ther the conduct of the parliament, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;entence, or of his Maje&s;ty who &s;igned it, was mo&s;t completely inde|&s;encible.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t 1714, Queen Anne died; and as much has been &s;aid in prai&s;e of her virtues, a &s;hort account of a tran&s;|action conducted by her Tory parliament is here in&s;erted, which in part is abridged from the Anecdotes of the Earl of Chatham.</P>
<P>It has been told by many hi&s;torians, that for four years, Queen Anne gave an hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum</HI> out of her civil li&s;t, to &s;upport the war again&s;t France; and hence they deduce an argument of the oeconomy and patrioti&s;m of that Prince&s;s.&mdash;But, on the 25th of june 1713, her Maje&s;ty ac|quainted the Commons that &s;he had contracted a very large debt upon the revenues of the civil li&s;t; and &s;he &s;pecified that this deficiency amounted in Augu&s;t 1710, to four hundred thou|&s;and pounds.&mdash;Mr. Smith, one of the tellers in the Exchequer,
<PB N="66" REF="028380_0067_0FD8DEEF31907230">
who &s;eems to have been too hone&s;t a man for his office, aro&s;e and informed the Hou&s;e, that the e&s;timate of this debt was to him a&s;toni&s;hing; as at the time pointed out, he could affirm, that the debt amounted to little more than an hundred thou&s;and pounds. Other members undertook to prove, that the funds a&s;&s;igned to her Maje&s;ty for &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> had produced <HI>eight</HI> hundred thou&s;and pounds, &s;o that in the cour&s;e of eleven years, her Maje&s;ty had received eleven hun|dred thou&s;and pounds of an <HI>overplus,</HI> and after deducing the pretended <HI>gift</HI> of four hundred thou&s;and pounds, &s;he had &s;till <HI>&s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling</HI> of the public money in her pocket. Though this was the &s;ame virtuous a&s;&s;embly which had expelled Walpole from bribery, the&s;e ob&s;ervations could not obtain attention; &s;ince the very next day the Hou&s;e voted five hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds for payment of this debt. <Q>This, adds the hi&s;torian, is the truth, and the whole truth of that generous exploit of the daughter of James the Se|cond.

<P>It is entertaining to remark the &s;tyle in which a courtier &s;ometimes talks of his &s;overeign. When William, in a fit of de&s;pondency, had once threatened to re&s;ign the crown of Eng|land, <Q>Does he &s;o?" &s;aid Sunderland, "there is Tom of Pembroke, (meaning Lord Pembroke) who is as good a block of wood <HI>as a king can be cut out of.</HI> We will &s;end for him, and make <HI>him</HI> our KING <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoire of Great Britain, vol. ii. part 3. book 7.</NOTE>.</Q> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e the Prince&s;s of Wales, in 1753, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as to George the Second, in a conver&s;ation with Mr. Dodington. <Q>She &s;aid, with great warmth, that when they talked to her of the King, &s;he lo&s;t all patience, for &s;he knew <HI>it was nothing:</HI> that in the&s;e great points &s;he reckoned the King no more <HI>than one of the trees we walked by,</HI> or &s;omething more incon&s;iderable which &s;he named, but that it was their pu&s;illanimity <HI>which

tell <HI>what has become of it,</HI> or <HI>how it has been employed,</HI> but we know that no part of it has been applied to the &s;ervice of the nation. We have &s;ince paid &s;everal large arrears into which the civil li&s;t had fallen, and an hundred thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> have been added to the royal &s;alary. At the &s;ame time, the nation has been borrowing money to pay that &s;alary, the expences of Gibraltar and Canada, for the &s;upport of the war-&s;y&s;tem, and other matters, nominally at three and a half, or four <HI>per cent.</HI> but in reality, as &s;hall be explained hereafter, at &s;ix or eight <HI>per cent.</HI> Hence, by the way, the calculations as to Gib|raltar are one third part lower in point of compound intere&s;t <HI>than they &s;hould have been,</HI> and the fifteen millions of George the Second, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing to ninety-one millions and a half, would, at &s;even and an half <HI>per cent.</HI> have extended to about <HI>an hundred and thirty millions, &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds;</HI> which would a pre&s;ent buy out more than one half of our national debt, and &s;ave the country from an annual burden of perhaps <HI>four millions and an half &s;terling.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t mi&s;erable part of the &s;tory &s;till remains to be told; but the particulars mu&s;t be deferred to &s;ome future opportunity. The civil li&s;t is a gulf yawing to ab&s;orb the whole property of the Briti&s;h empire. We look back without &s;atisfaction, and forward without hope.</P>
<P>Lord Che&s;terfield informs us, that George the Fir&s;t was exceedingly hurt even by the weak oppo&s;ition which he met in parliament, on account of &s;ub&s;idies; and could not help com|plaining to his mo&s;t intimate friends, that he had come over to England to be <HI>a begging King.</HI> His vexation was, that he could not command money without the farce of a&s;king it; for in his reign, as at pre&s;ent, the debates of parliament were but a farce. Such were the liberal &s;entiments of the fir&s;t &s;overeign of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
