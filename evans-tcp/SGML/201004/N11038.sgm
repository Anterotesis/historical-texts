<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends, and Fellow-Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me conjure you by all you hold dear, here and hereafter, by all the ties of nature and ju&s;tice, to rou&s;e in defence of your per&s;ecu|ted brethern and fellow &s;ubjects in America, who daily fall innocent victims to lawle&s;s power: let me intreat you to rou&s;e in defence of your rights and liberties; tho&s;e rights and liberties which heaven gave, and for which your fathers bravely fought, and gloriou&s;ly fell, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves and their po&s;terity free; be a&s;&s;ured if bleeding America can be reduced to &s;lavery, all the boa&s;ted privileges of Engli&s;hmen mu&s;t fall with her: let me therefore be&s;eech you to oppo&s;e with uplifted hands, and &s;treatched out arms, the cruel, bloody, &amp; unnatural Tyranny of George the third, and his diabolical Tory minions: Perdition, de&s;truction, and all the mi&s;eries of a tortured death, attend the wretch, who calls
<PB N="182" REF="013988_0002_0F9258099E8EB160">him&s;elf an Engli&s;hman, and yet can tamely &s;ee his brother, or fellow &s;ubject, peri&s;h through wanton cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion or the &s;word.</P>
<P>No tyrant was ever more de&s;potic and cruel than the pre&s;ent Sovereign, who di&s;graces the &s;eat of royalty in the Briti&s;h empire; no Court ever more corrupt than his, and yet, O my countrymen, to this mercile&s;s and de&s;potic tyrant, and to his wicked and corrupt mini&s;try, you &s;acrifice your rights, and yield a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the gloomy, the dreadful pro&s;pect before you, the plains of America are running with the blood of the inhabitants, her e&s;&s;ence of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution de&s;troyed, and nothing but the form, the mere &s;hadow of it remains; all the dear bought liberties, purcha&s;ed and &s;ealed with the blood of your forefathers, wre&s;ted from you by the polluted hands of an abandoned &s;et of mi&s;creants, &s;upported and defended by a royal tyrant; and a dark cloud of &s;lavery, like a ri&s;ing tempe&s;t; over&s;preads the land, it approaches &s;wiftly, and at this moment threatens our de&s;truction; it is therefore high time you &s;hould be rou&s;ed and awakened to a &s;en&s;e of your danger, and by an appeal to heaven, by a glorious re&s;i&s;tance, provide for your common &s;afety.</P>
<P>This is the only way, we have no other, to pre|vent the ruin that threatens us, if we are inattentive or inactive at this time, our chains will be fa&s;t ri|vetted, and liberty mu&s;t expire; your petitions and remon&s;trances have been &s;purned by the King, and you have now no remedy left but that of entering
<PB N="183" REF="013988_0003_0F92580A50A26C40">into an ASSOCIATION in defence of your com|mon rights, and the rights of America. They have &s;et you a noble example, an example worthy of Britons, an example which you are bound by all the principles of ju&s;tice and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation to follow: he mu&s;t be blind that is not convinced of this, and he is an abandoned wretch, an enemy to mankind, who will not per&s;ue the road.</P>
<P>Upon your virtue and re&s;olution at this juncture, depends the &s;alvation of England and America; it is now in your power to prevent the farther pro|gre&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m, the butchery of your fellow|countrymen, and your&s;elves from &s;lavery and ruin.</P>
<P>When the humble &s;upplications of an oppre&s;&s;ed people are treated with contempt, and a deaf ear turned to their complaints, when their rights are daily invaded, their property unlawfully wre&s;ted from them, and their blood inhumanly &s;hed, it is incumbent on them, it is a duty they owe to God and their country, to take the field and re&s;i&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, to &s;hew them&s;elves brave, when bra|very is required, and dare to be re&s;olute in the hour of danger. Remember, my fellow countrymen, our predece&s;&s;ors led the way, the Americans have followed their noble example, and we are bound to follow them. Where would have been Liberty and Property, if it had not been for the virtue, bravery, and re&s;olution of our ance&s;tors? They &s;tood forth in the glorious cau&s;e, and many of them &s;ecured it to po&s;terity with their blood. Shall we then, tamely &s;ubmit to have tho&s;e privileges for which they fought and fell, ravi&s;hed from us by a
<PB N="184" REF="013988_0004_0F9258F58CDF49C0">lawle&s;s tribe of men, who call them&s;elves Senators or Mini&s;ters, and who taking advantage of their Prince, are laying wa&s;te their country, and &s;pread|ing de&s;olation through the land? Shall it be &s;aid in after times, that the year One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Seventy Five, was le&s;s glorious than that of Sixteen Hundred and Eighty Eight; and that as the age grew more and more enlightened, it become more and more pu&s;illanimous. Forbid it Heaven!</P>
<P>Let me intreat you O! Engli&s;hmen, to rou&s;e from that &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s in which you have &s;o long lain; open your eyes to the danger that &s;ur|rounds you, and &s;tand forth the defenders of Ame|rican virtue and public liberty. Havoc is now the cry at St. James's, and the dogs of war are let loo&s;e to tear out the vitals of our brethern; Ameri|ca through the abandoned cruelty of an accur&s;ed admini&s;tration, and an unrelenting King, is become a field of blood, over&s;pread with de&s;olation and &s;laughter. It is in your power to put an end to this horrid, unnatural civil war, it mu&s;t owe its extinction or continuance to you, if you are virtuous, brave, and re&s;olute, the lives, liberties, and properties of your fellow &s;ubjects, may be pre&s;erved, and your country &s;aved from de&s;truction; if on the contrary, you &s;hould be irre&s;olute and pu&s;illanimous at this time, (unworthy the name of Engli&s;hmen) thou|&s;ands, many thou&s;and lives mu&s;t be lo&s;t; the liber|ties of England will be no more, and your proper|ty taken from you at the will and plea&s;ure of the King and his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It can only be from the virtue and united efforts of
<PB N="185" REF="013988_0005_0F9258F5C26330D8">England and America, that the con&s;titution of Great-Britain, and all our invaluable privileges can be pre&s;erved; &s;hould you remain quiet &s;pectators of the pre&s;ent inhuman Ma&s;&s;acrees, and de&s;tructive mea&s;ures, you will de&s;erve the wor&s;t of &s;lavery, and the cruele&s;t puni&s;hment ever inflicted on a people.</P>
<P>If you have any honour, if you have any virtue, or any bravery, you will now &s;tand forth and re&s;i&s;t the tyrants, you will demand the heads of tho&s;e men, who advi&s;ed tho&s;e &s;anguinary, fatal, and ruinous mea&s;ures; you will declare to the world, you will not con&s;ent to arbitrary inva&s;ions of your liberties, arbitrary di&s;pen&s;ing with the laws, and ar|bitrary governing by an army; that you owe no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a King, beyond the bounds of law; that your lives, liberties, and e&s;tates, &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed of at his plea&s;ure, and that you are bound by the laws of God and man, to re&s;i&s;t a tyrant; that you will oppo&s;e all unju&s;t violence, and tho&s;e who attempt the life of the con&s;titution, as the great enemies of their country; this has been prac|ti&s;ed in all ages, and all nations determine, that when Kings invade the lives, liberties, or properties of their &s;ubjects, that tear up the foundation of public freedom, and the &s;acred con&s;titution of their coun|try, may be re&s;i&s;ted, either by calling in and join|ing with foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or by taking arms in defence of the law and common liberty; this is what was declared at the Revolution, and this is the foundation upon which the people took arms in the time of Charles the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The axe is now at the root of the tree; the
<PB N="186" REF="013988_0006_0F9258F6803A8860">overthrow of the Con&s;titution is the great de&s;ign of the King and his mini&s;ters, the open and avowed enemies to the rights of mankind, who have already &s;ufficiently proved to the world, that they mean the &s;ubver&s;ion of the univer&s;al right of Chri&s;tians and &s;ubjects. Let tho&s;e, my countrymen, who plead for tyrants, &s;ubmit to their power; but let us e&s;teem liberty, religion, and property, equally with our lives, every man's birthright by nature; no go|vernment ever received a legal authority to abridge or take it away; nor has God ve&s;ted any &s;ingle or confederated power in any hands to de&s;troy it; and it is in defence of the&s;e glorious priviledges, the&s;e common rights, I have written this paper, and to pre&s;erve them unviolated by the polluted hands of lawle&s;s tyrants, I would lay down my life, for life is a burthen in any other &s;tate but that of freedom.</P>
<P>It is notoriou&s;ly known, notwith&s;tanding all the royal and mini&s;terial fal&s;hoods which have been, and are daily advanced, to our di&s;grace, it is known that we do not enjoy, undimini&s;hed, one &s;ingle priviledge purcha&s;ed by the blood of our ance&s;tors, and confirmed to us by Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. Every man then, who remains pa&s;&s;ive at this time, is an enemy and a traitor to his coun|try. I loo&s;e all kind of patience when I reflect up|on the melancholy &s;ituation of England and Ameri|ca, and the villainous principles of tho&s;e men, in|tru&s;ted by the &s;overeign with the management of the affairs of this once great, free, and powerful kingdom, I am fired with a ju&s;t indignation again&s;t the authors of our misfortunes; and if I appear too warm, I hope it will be imputed to my zeal in the
<PB N="187" REF="013988_0007_0F9258FB1F1EFAE0">public cau&s;e, and not to any malice or re&s;entment, again&s;t individuals, for I here declare to have none, but I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;top the further effu&s;ion of human blood, and would willingly &s;acrifice my life, could I re&s;cue my country from the hands of particides and traitors, and from that de&s;truction which now threatens it.</P>

<P><HI>The nece&s;&s;ity, utility, and national advantage of a political paper in defence of the natural rights of man|kind at this important aera, mu&s;t appear greater than at the la&s;t glorious Revolution, We now &s;ee, and with infinite concern, the King and Mini&s;try, the Lords and Commons, all united, and firmly re&s;olved, on per|&s;uing mea&s;ures, which (without a noble oppo&s;ition from the people) mu&s;t end in the de&s;truction of the laws, rights, and liberties, of the whole Briti&s;h empire, in England and America. It is therefore only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, this paper will be carried on by two gentlemen of literary abilities, alike enemies to the arbitrary ef|forts of ONE, or a purcha&s;ed majority of FIVE HUNDRED and FIFTY EIGHT TYRANTS, to whom they, and they hope, their fellow &s;ubjects, never will &s;ubmit.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The CRISIS will be continued with &s;pirit, in defiance of every exertion of lawle&s;s power, upon the true principles of the con&s;titution, again&s;t the &s;ecret na|chinations, and de&s;potic de&s;igns, of the pre&s;ent corrupt
<PB N="188" REF="013988_0008_0F9258FC84875CE0">court and mini&s;try. The authors being determined, even at the ri&s;k of every thing that is dear to man, to re&s;cue the liberty of the pre&s;s, the natural rights of mankind, and the con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, in England and America, from that ruin, with which they are now threatened. In order with more ea&s;e to accompli&s;h the&s;e great ends, they earne&s;tly beg the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of tho&s;e, who are real friends to the laws, liber|ties, and con&s;titution of their country.</HI></P>
