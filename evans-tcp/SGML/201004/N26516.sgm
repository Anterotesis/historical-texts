<HEAD>THE ART OF EXCELLING; AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>EMULATION is commmon to all our race. Competition pervades every age of life, and every grade of character. From the child who li&s;ps his alphabet, to the grand&s;ire who tells the &s;tory of his better days; from the boy whirling his ball, to the hero commanding his army; we find all influenced by a &s;imilar &s;pirit of emulation. The object of emulation is excellence. All competitors wi&s;h for excellence, whatever may be the object of pur&s;uit; whether gold or glory, amu&s;ement or virtue. Per|haps we have never known the man who could wil|lingly &s;ee all men excel him&s;elf in all things. He might, in many re&s;pects, yield the palm of excellence to many; but he would have &s;ome favourite com|petition in which he would willingly be equalled by none.</P>
<P>WITH all this ardour for excellence, we com|mence life with no native pre-eminence. Our real character is the production of our own exertion. God has wi&s;ely given to man merely e&s;&s;ence; he has left the formation of his character to the effort of his own energies. He has &s;aid, that unle&s;s he mark him&s;elf with deeds of &s;plendour, which may give him to &s;hine along the current of duration, even im|mortality
<PB N="6" REF="035254_0005_1001CEBAAF305E38">
it&s;elf &s;hall but perpetuate his in&s;ignificance, and continue him an undi&s;tingui&s;hed particle in the great ocean of being.</P>
<P>THUS de&s;titute of &s;uperiority, and thus de&s;irous of di&s;tingui&s;hing merit, each young mortal awakes from the &s;lumbers of nihility; and, &s;tarting off in the career of exi&s;tence, eagerly enquires how he mu&s;t run, to obtain the prize of excellence. The art of excelling, therefore, is univer&s;ally important. It intere&s;ts every individual of man. It cannot then be improperly cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of a few ob&s;er|vations before a Society which has no views &s;eparate from the common intere&s;t of humanity.</P>
<P>EXCELLENCE may be obtained, fir&s;t, by an e&s;tima|tion of our powers; and &s;econdly, by calling up be|fore our minds the motives naturally urging the&s;e powers into exertion.</P>
<P>AFTER a perfect review of all the energies of his nature, man mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that every atchieve|ment which can augment human merit, lies within the reach of human acqui&s;ition. The fir&s;t rule, therefore, in the art of excelling, is to convince our|&s;elves that we can excel.</P>
<P>FOR want of this conviction, many things are fru&s;|trated. All imperfect actions are the offspring of undecided efforts. If any thing be done weakly or partially; if any enterprize be feebly attempted and fail in the execution, it is becau&s;e he who attempted the performance doubted his &s;kill, his energy, or his &s;ucce&s;s. This doubtfulne&s;s generates that timidity which forever unnerves the arm of exertion. On the contrary, all noble deeds have been done by tho&s;e who greatly believed God had rendered them capable of the atchievement. This generous per&s;ua&s;ion of mind gives courage, fortitude, per&s;everance; and thus dimini&s;hes danger, removes difficulty, and &s;ur|mounts ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035254_0006_1001CEC599617F60">THESE truths will be &s;till more illu&s;trated and evinced, if we advert to a few examples. Many a midnight taper has &s;hed its la&s;t glimmering ray on the &s;ons of contemplation, who, but for this per&s;ua&s;ion, had repo&s;ed them&s;elves with the children of thought|le&s;s ignorance, or rioted amid&s;t the votaries of di&s;&s;i|pation.</P>
<P>DEMOSTHENES, from a timid, li&s;ping, he&s;itating, &s;tammering &s;chool-boy, formed him&s;elf into an Ora|tor, &s;o perfect&mdash;&s;o per&s;ua&s;ive&mdash;&s;o commanding&mdash;that for years he baffled all the intrigues of Macedonian u&s;urpation; pu&s;hed back the torrent of popular li|centiou&s;ne&s;s; and, while all Greece was falling into the iron hands of &s;lavery, he, by the mere charms of his eloquence, allured liberty to hover over his na|tive city, and give at lea&s;t a momentary lu&s;tre to the fading glory of Athens. How did he perform this? He believed he could perform it. This belief gave him re&s;olution, gave him per&s;everance, gave him &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>SOCRATES, the pride of Pagan morality, by con|&s;titution was prone to every vice. He was deceit|ful, intemperate, voluptuous, addicted to revenge, a betrayer of men, a bla&s;phemer of the Gods. All the&s;e vices were &s;o congenial to his nature, that they were marked in the very features of his face. But, in reality, he was the very rever&s;e of all the&s;e. He was &s;incere, moderate, above the allurements of plea|&s;ure, patient of injuries to a proverb, of a fidelity ne|ver to be corrupted, and influenced by an habitual reverence for the gods, and a devotion to their pro|vidence. How was this? How did Socrates thus oppo&s;e the united current of all his propen&s;ities, ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions? How did he thus change, and in a manner re-create him&s;elf? It was becau&s;e he felt a certain divine conviction of &s;oul, that all this mighty revolution lay within the reach of his power.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035254_0007_1001CECFCB4B8A60">THE di&s;coverer of the new world affords us ano|ther illu&s;trious example. All the avarice, envy, ig|norance and &s;uper&s;tition of the fifteenth century, ro&s;e up again&s;t him. An ocean lay between him and the object of his enterprize. He could &s;tand on the hills of Europe, and view the wave, ri&s;ing at his foot, and rolling until it wa&s;hed again&s;t the di&s;tant hori|zon; but all beyond was uncertainty. It might be a continent of inacce&s;&s;ible rocks; it might be a world of waters, by whirlpools and &s;hallows impa&s;&s;able, and vexed with everla&s;ting &s;torms. What but this un|doubting per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, could have given him a &s;uperiority to all the&s;e ob&s;tacles?</P>
<P>IT was the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion which, in the Ameri|can revolution, carried the volunteers of New-Eng|land through the pathle&s;s, &s;avage-haunted, winter wil|derne&s;s of Maine. It was this which tore the laurel of conque&s;t from the brow of Albian glory, and wrote the names of COLUMBIA and WASHINGTON among the &s;tars. If, indeed, any thing good or great, any thing worthy to be heard by nations, to be told to po&s;terity, and had in perpetual remembrance, has ever been done, it has been done by tho&s;e alone who nobly believed &s;ucce&s;s was within their power. Let, therefore, him who would excel, fir&s;t be per&s;uad|ed that he is capable of excellence. Let him believe he can do all things within the reach of human at|chievement; that his mind may progre&s;s in improve|ment, until nothing but infinity remains incompre|hen&s;ible, nothing but boundle&s;s benevolence unprac|ti&s;ed.</P>
<P>THOUGH we may have &s;urveyed the powers of our nature, and feel the certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, yet we &s;hall never attempt any enterprize, until we are a&s;&s;ur|ed the completion of it will in &s;ome re&s;pect augment our felicity. All our actions are the offspring of motives; and our own felicity is the great motive
<PB N="9" REF="035254_0008_1001CEDA78124750">
of all our actions. We have three great &s;ources of felicity with which every other &s;tream of delight ul|timately mingles it&s;elf. The fir&s;t is &s;elf-approbation; the next the prai&s;e of other beings; and the la&s;t the eternal duration of all tho&s;e acquirements, by which the two others are obtained.</P>
<P>LET us then, as another rule in the art of excel|ling, contemplate the&s;e three primary &s;prings of our felicity as the great motives of excellence.</P>
<P>IF the mind be not vitiated, &s;elf approbation can be acquired by nothing le&s;s than excellence. For if emulation be one of our &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, if the ob|ject of emulation be excellence, if we are convinced that whatever con&s;titutes excellence lies within the reach of our po&s;&s;ible acqui&s;ition, then it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for the mind entirely to approve it&s;elf, until it has obtained excellence.</P>
<P>PERHAPS nothing more augments our felicity than &s;elf approbation. The approbation of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to us, &s;preads over the heart the fine&s;t touches of delight. The parent in who&s;e bo&s;om we have been nurtured, and the country where we fir&s;t be|held this plea&s;ant light of heaven, are forever dear to us. It is becau&s;e their idea, woven into the very texture of our exi&s;tence, forms a part of our&s;elves; and we have it not in our power to rend them away from us, and not lacerate the fibres of that heart with which they are thus incorporated. Yet our&s;elves are more dear; and all the love which we feel for any part of &s;en&s;itive creation, is but the offspring of that love which we feel for our&s;elves. God has wi&s;ely given each man to con&s;ider him&s;elf the centre of that moral hemi&s;phere in which he has placed him. Things intere&s;t him le&s;s and le&s;s, as they re|cede from him; until, by di&s;tance, they fade into undi&s;tingui&s;hed indifference, and &s;ink below the far-off horizon. If becau&s;e our fellow men, our coun|try
<PB N="10" REF="035254_0009_1001CEE7C5BBB660">
and our friends are dear to us, we are delighted with their approbation, what mu&s;t we feel when our bo&s;oms warm with con&s;cious integrity, and expand with the exhilirating &s;miles of our own &s;ouls?</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is not all. A plea&s;ure attends the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e acquirements, which purcha&s;e &s;elf approbation. When our minds are not vitiated, what perfects our nature we approve; what depraves it we condemn. The man, therefore, who thoroughly approves him&s;elf, has acquired every perfection of which his nature is already capable. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue, knowledge, &s;cience, ta&s;te, refinement. The &s;erenity of temperance, the firmne&s;s of forti|tude, the magnanimity of benevolence, are among the habits of his heart. He has contemplated moral and material nature, until his expanded mind &s;eems a region embo&s;oming the univer&s;e; and &s;plendidly ornamented with all the rich garniture of phy&s;ical and intellectual &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>THE value of &s;elf approbation is enhanced by its independence. It mu&s;t be to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or certain and permanent, becau&s;e it lies within him&s;elf. That vortex of contingency which whirls in its du&s;ty at|mo&s;phere all things el&s;e of man, reaches not the &s;till retreat of a &s;elf approving heart. Envy, malevo|lence and calumny, have no power over it. They gna&s;h their iron fangs, and rai&s;e their nocturnal howls in vain.</P>
<P>SELF approbation is a &s;ource of plea&s;ure in&s;epara|ble from us. Wherever we may be called by in|clination, or driven by nece&s;&s;ity; whether in the retreats of rural &s;olitude, or the noi&s;y tumults of the clamorous city; place us on the winter-beaten plains of Labrador, or the &s;erpent-haunted &s;hores of &s;tormy Huron, or in the rocky bo&s;om of the frowning Al|leghanies, none of the&s;e peregrinations will ever remove us from a &s;elf approving heart. It &s;miles
<PB N="11" REF="035254_0010_1001CEF580D8A108">
with a kind of omnipotent beneficence, will forever &s;trew the vernal glories of paradi&s;e before us. Nay, let the&s;e bodies become the &s;port of accident; let the corroding current of time wear them away; let their particles, unlocked from each others' embrace, be driven by whirlwinds round the globe, or &s;ub|tilized to aether, and &s;cattered through immen|&s;ity; &s;till &s;elf approbation will be with us while our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or our &s;ouls remain, be they ten|ants of no matter what department of duration, whe|ther on this or t'other &s;ide the billowy wa&s;te of ages.</P>
<P>IF therefore &s;elf approbation give &s;en&s;ations &s;o delightful; if it comprehend all the improvements of our nature; if it lie above the reach of contin|gency, and be forever in&s;eparable from us, does it not contain much of that which makes us ble&s;&s;ed? If &s;elf approbation can be obtained by no mean acqui&s;ition; if the &s;oul never &s;mile on it&s;elf &s;o long as it has tarni&s;hed one deed with a malevolent de&s;ign, or left one meritorious action unperformed; if nothing but excellence can purcha&s;e &s;elf approba|tion, then &s;urely as much as each man de&s;ires a &s;ource of felicity exqui&s;ite, comprehen&s;ive, independent and durable, &s;o much will he labour for that excellence, by which alone it can be obtained.</P>
<P>THE prai&s;e of that Being, to whom we are all amenable, is a &s;ubject too &s;olemn for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, too hallowed for the pre&s;ent &s;peaker. With what, and how many other beings we &s;tand related, is now, perhaps, &s;omewhat doubtful. In &s;peaking, therefore, of the prai&s;e of other beings, as a &s;ource of happine&s;s, and a motive of excellence, the prai&s;e of our fellow men only will be mentioned.</P>
<P>For this prai&s;e perhaps all have a fondne&s;s: It may with ju&s;tice be &s;aid, that man loves the applau&s;e of man. The wi&s;e ancients were of this opinion. They regarded a love of glory as the &s;tronge&s;t proof
<PB N="12" REF="035254_0011_1001CEFFE3567688">
of man's divine original; and ever con&s;idered tho&s;e minds the mo&s;t exalted, which had the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e. Men &s;eem prepared by their na|ture, not only to admire and applaud whatever is magnificent in the atchievements of others, but al&s;o to feel a peculiar delight in the merit and fruition of that applau&s;e which is the ju&s;t reward of noble actions. The &s;ame men who have readily re&s;ign|ed ea&s;e, plea&s;ure and tranquility; a&s;&s;umed care, en|dured fatigue, and &s;miled amid&s;t perilous enter|prizes, have yet trembled at the fir&s;t approach of in|famy. None are &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o worthle&s;s, &s;o entirely in&s;ignificant, &s;o contaminated with crimes or &s;carred with ignominy, but they &s;till fancy them&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome &s;hade, &s;ome faded tint of excellency. Place them on the lowe&s;t grade of human infamy, and even there the cold dank breath of univer&s;al neglect cannot entirely extingui&s;h this god-like pa&s;|&s;ion. From that aby&s;s of depre&s;&s;ion, they lift their eyes towards the &s;un of glory, and vainly &s;olace them&s;elves with recollection of their blighted ho|nours.</P>
<P>THAT the acqui&s;ition of this glory and applau&s;e, which men &s;o ardently de&s;ire, will greatly augment the felicity of tho&s;e who obtain them, cannot be doubted. It is no le&s;s certain, that this applau&s;e can be obtained by excellence alone. In the unvitiated &s;tate of public opinion, there &s;eems to be a tacit agreement among mankind, to be&s;tow ex|traordinary prai&s;e on nothing but extraordinary merit. This originates from the very con&s;titution of our nature. We never &s;et a high value on ea&s;y acqui&s;itions. Rational men &s;eldom arrogate to them&s;elves any merit on account of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of accidental honour or emolument. But acquire|ments made by toil, care, vigilance and long per&s;e|verance, are highly prized. Their value &s;eems en|hanced
<PB N="13" REF="035254_0012_1001CF086EB2C5E0">
by all the anxiety of pur&s;uit, and all the diffi|culty of acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE emergencies of &s;ociety render this con&s;titu|tion nece&s;&s;ary. Some &s;ocial duties would never be performed, if any thing le&s;s than their performance could purcha&s;e the &s;ame applau&s;e and glory. We are &s;ometimes called to defend our country. It is true our country involves objects endeared to us by &s;o many relations, that, without any hope of glory for it, we might be induced to &s;tretch out our arm in its defence. But this is not enough. Men would fight with a caution little le&s;s than pu&s;illanimous, if they fought merely on the defen&s;ive. More than this mu&s;t be done in the day of battle. Men mu&s;t then make aggre&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t fight for acqui&s;ition, ru&s;h on danger, and be in a manner prodigal of life. When this is done, it is only becau&s;e no other atchievements purcha&s;e &s;o much glory as deeds of valour. It is the expectation of this glory which plucks from the brow of battle all its terrors, &s;oftens the field of &s;laughter into the bed of honour, and renders dying for our country delightful.</P>
<P>A DIFFERENT con&s;titution would, perhaps, &s;ub|vert &s;ociety. If applau&s;e were be&s;towed on ba&s;e|ne&s;s, indolence and cowardice; if the wreath of glo|ry were unbound from the brow of the valiant de|fender of his country, and held out to him who &s;hrunk from the point of danger, or betrayed the armies of his nation to their enemies, would not that virtue, "which &s;eeks no intere&s;t, no reward but prai&s;e," indignant retire from an ungrateful world? Would not vice, thus countenanced, encouraged and applauded, ride through the nations triumphant? Yes, the hero of Mount-Vernon would have &s;unk into contempt and oblivion, while the traitor of We&s;t-Point had not only re&s;cued his name from the
<PB N="14" REF="035254_0013_1001CF1585981D18">
gibbet of infamy, but ri&s;en glorious amid&s;t the ruins of his country. God hath therefore &s;aid to man, be&s;tow prai&s;e and applau&s;e on tho&s;e only, who have de&s;erved fame and glory by excellence.</P>
<P>IF then nature has given us &s;uch a de&s;ire for prai&s;e; if this pa&s;&s;ion be inextingui&s;hable by time or accident; if our feelings, the emergencies of &s;o|ciety, and in a manner the voice of God him&s;elf, command us to be&s;tow prai&s;e on tho&s;e only who have earned it by extraordinary merit, what motive can more loudly call up all the energies of our &s;ouls, and give us a warmer ardour in pur&s;uit of excel|lence, than a per&s;ua&s;ion, that by it alone, we can ob|tain that prai&s;e of our fellow men, which the human heart forever &s;o anxiou&s;ly de&s;ires?</P>
<P>THE eternal duration of tho&s;e acqui&s;itions by which we purcha&s;e our own approbation, and the prai&s;e of other beings, is another &s;ource of felicity, and another motive to excellence. All our mental improvements will be ours forever. The &s;oul's immortality is implied in this con&s;ideration. The truth of this doctrine is denied by the new &s;ect of phi|lo&s;ophers. In an a&s;&s;embly like this, compo&s;ed of enlightened Americans, we &s;hall not find one of that &s;ect; one who is delighted with the degradation of his nature; who prefers annihilation to exi&s;tence; who di&s;believes doctrines becau&s;e all men believe them, and becau&s;e God him&s;elf has declared them to be true. If there &s;hould be, now li&s;tening to the &s;peaker, one &s;uch mon&s;ter of ab&s;urdity, to him no argument can be addre&s;&s;ed. Pity may be extended to him, though his character mu&s;t be abhorred. He mu&s;t have de&s;igned or perpetrated iniquity, until he has travelled down all the grades of wickedne&s;s; until, by the la&s;h of remor&s;e, he is driven from the dominion of rea&s;on; and, to e&s;cape the &s;courgings
<PB N="15" REF="035254_0014_1001CCFA7A417B90">
of his own con&s;cience, he throws him&s;elf headlong into the aby&s;s of annihilation.</P>
<P>MEN of rationality can ea&s;ily perceive that every thing of man evinces his immortality. He de&s;ires it; he believes in it; he hopes for it. His toil, his exertion, his ambition, all ultimate on things be|yond the region of time. If man be immortal, all nature is con&s;i&s;tent; if not, all we know of God or his creation, is ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>MEN, therefore, &s;tarting off in the career of pur|&s;uit, warmed with emulation, and eager for the ac|qui&s;ition of excellence, ought to con&s;ider this life as the commencement of their exi&s;tence. It will continue forever; and he who, by &s;uperior exer|tion, advances forward of his fellow beings, may retain that advantage through an eternal progre&s;|&s;ion. We &s;hall make no improvement in vain; for when we die in this &s;tate of exi&s;tence, we &s;hall live in another. Tho&s;e who have mo&s;t knowledge, ex|cellence and virtue in this world, will have mo&s;t knowledge, excellence and virtue in that. Tho&s;e who in this world have toiled for the improvement of their nature; who have refrained from plea&s;ure; endured &s;elf denial; earned their own approbation, and purcha&s;ed applau&s;e and glory, &s;hall &s;tand bright|ened by all the&s;e excellencies on the &s;hores of eter|nity.</P>
<P>IMMORTALITY gives importance to all our acqui|&s;itions. Write eternity on the mo&s;t trivial con&s;e|quences of our mo&s;t trivial actions, and they expand them&s;elves into a magnitude, who&s;e dimen&s;ions can|not be reached by finite conception. The thread, though attenuated down almo&s;t to imperceptibility, yet, if it be infinitely extended, will comprehend the material univer&s;e.</P>
<P>INDEED, without immortality, nothing would be worth pur&s;uit. If death be the termination of our
<PB N="16" REF="035254_0015_1001B299D9A2CE20">
exi&s;tence, the grave will de&s;troy all acqui&s;itions, and equalize all characters. The &s;age and the fool, the philo&s;opher and the child of ignorance, the virtuous and the debauchee, the hero and the coward, the honourable and the infamous, the excellent and the contemptible, will crumble together into one com|mon indi&s;criminate in&s;ignificancy. If this be &s;o, who will toil to improve his nature, or brighten the path of his exi&s;tence with deeds of &s;plendour? Even glory it&s;elf would not be worth pur&s;uit. And in|deed what is the glory attainable by one who lives but three &s;core years? A moment's reflection will di&s;cover. Survey the many kingdoms, countries and regions of the earth, together with the millions who inhabit them; look back over the numberle&s;s generations of men, who&s;e names are blotted out of time; turn your eye forward to the myriads of their po&s;terity, ri&s;ing in long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to follow them down the &s;ame du&s;ky road of oblivion; walk abroad into the univer&s;e, beholding the multitude of worlds &s;warming with population, and then turn and in&s;pect this earth, and mark out the &s;pot of which we are tenants, and the number of beings to which we are known, and in this view of "the amazing whole," mu&s;t not a &s;mall part of a &s;mall country on this little earth be the &s;cene of our mo&s;t mighty deeds? And in &s;o &s;hort a period, to how few of the countle&s;s myriads of intelligences &s;ucce&s;&s;ively tenanting all &s;pace, and exi&s;ting through all duration, can we po&s;&s;ibly render our&s;elves known!</P>
<P>NAY, were the fame of our actions to be carried to the remote&s;t corner of the earth; were po&s;terity to gaze on the &s;plendour of our glory, and even our buried forefathers to pau&s;e amid&s;t their iron &s;lum|bers, and li&s;ten to the renown of their &s;ons; yet, how &s;hort and how very worthle&s;s is that reputation, to which we mu&s;t become in&s;en&s;ible at the clo&s;e of
<PB N="17" REF="035254_0016_1001CF354C293860">
this life! If, therefore, the &s;oul does not live for an everla&s;ting fruition of its acqui&s;itions, nothing can be more important to man, than the few tran&s;itory objects that come in contact with his &s;en&s;es. "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," might ju&s;tly be his wi&s;e&s;t rule of life.</P>
<P>BUT when we mea&s;ure our exi&s;tence by the line of eternity; when we know our pre&s;ent actions will give a colour to the whole current of our being; that each virtue, which in this life blo&s;&s;oms in our &s;ouls, &s;hall exhale immortal fragrance, and blu&s;h with beauty forever renovating; that each of our no|ble deeds, brightened by the conflagration of mate|rial nature, &s;hall with us ri&s;e re&s;plendent from the wide ruins of mortality; we &s;hall feel our&s;elves warmed, and elevated, and energized with de&s;ires which can be &s;atisfied with nothing le&s;s than im|mortal excellence.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE FEDERAL ADELPHI,</P>
<P>THOUGH we &s;hroud our&s;elves in my&s;tery, and conceal the arcana of our Society from the world by unviolated &s;ilence, yet improvement was the de&s;ign of our in&s;titution. As men, and as philo&s;ophers, hu|man actions are the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubjects of our re&s;earch. The philo&s;ophy of them is not more &s;ubtle and curious, than u&s;eful and important. A &s;ketch of this philo&s;ophy has ju&s;t been attempted. If the principles adduced exi&s;t in our nature, they give birth to a train of con&s;equences which ought exceed|ingly to influence our conduct.</P>
<P>If a conviction that we can excel be the fir&s;t &s;tep towards excellence, then, as friends to human im|provement, we ought to exalt human nature. We may not depre&s;s even a child, in its own e&s;timation;
<PB N="18" REF="035254_0017_1001CF3F9AF6FC10">
and he who does it, may remember that he quenches an immortal ardour, "and cru&s;hes in the birth a pow|er etherial."</P>
<P>I KNOW there is a gloomy-minded philo&s;ophy con|&s;tantly employed in decrying human nature; "the la&s;t and be&s;t of all God's works" on earth. Men who have been long lectured by the profe&s;&s;ors of this philo&s;ophy, have at length doubted their ability to perform even the common vocations of life; and become degraded in their own e&s;timation, until they were prepared for the mo&s;t benighted ignor|ance, and the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive &s;lavery. Let their doctrine once he univer&s;ally credited, and we &s;hall all adopt the maxims of Indo&s;tan philo&s;ophy. We &s;hall &s;ay, to &s;it &s;till is better than to walk; to &s;leep than to wake; and to die is be&s;t of all. Perhaps there are few me|thods by which we could more advance human im|provement, than by rea&s;oning or ridiculing from the catalogue of human opinion, this gloomy, heart-&s;ink|ing, foul deba&s;ing doctrine.</P>
<P>IF &s;elf approbation be a motive of action, then our moral ta&s;te &s;hould be carefully formed on the prin|ciples of rectitude. Though in the healthy &s;tate of the mind, when all its &s;en&s;es are correct and delicate, it approves of excellence only; yet our mental, like our corporeal &s;en&s;es, may be greatly vitiated. I know not but our moral &s;en&s;e may be &s;o vitiated, that we may approve our&s;elves for actions which we now condemn as vicious. If from infancy, fal&s;hood and treachery have been recommended to us, may we not finally feel our&s;elves more excellent in the prac|tice of the&s;e vices, than in the practice of the mo&s;t perfect &s;incerity and faithfulne&s;s? If from the birth of rea&s;on to its maturity, we have been taught, by the precepts and examples of all around us, to con|temn &s;cience, its in&s;titutions, di&s;ciples and inculca|tors,
<PB N="19" REF="035254_0018_1001CF4A2D162510">
&s;hall we not look on the preachers of philo&s;o|phy, and knowledge, and morals, and religion, as the pilferers and pe&s;ts of &s;ociety? Shall we not &s;ay to evil, "be thou our good;" ignorance, be thou our excellency? So far, therefore, as &s;elf approbation is a motive of excellence, we &s;hall aim to excel in what we mo&s;t approve. If this be what is good and wi&s;e, we &s;hall aim to excel in goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom; if it be what is wicked and fooli&s;h, we &s;hall aim to excel in wickedne&s;s and folly.</P>
<P>How important, then, is a correct and delicate moral ta&s;te; a ta&s;te approbating our&s;elves for no ac|tion which does not produce felicity!</P>
<P>MAY we not ju&s;tly doubt that creed, which char|acterizes actions <HI>entirely</HI> by their motives; which teaches means may be &s;anctified by their end? This je&s;uitical ca&s;ui&s;try has been modernized in the poli|tical laboratories of Europe. From thence it comes forth an all purifying e&s;&s;ence. It gives its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to wade through &s;eas of horrors with garments un|contaminated; or bleaches his &s;carlet abominations white as the robes of innocence. Let us &s;tand afar from its dreadful influence.</P>
<P>IF the prai&s;e of our fellow men be a motive of action, then it is important that the public ta&s;te be correct. Though the world will be ju&s;t, though a thou&s;and erroneous opinions will fade away, and no|thing but uncontaminated truth finally appear; yet public ta&s;te may be at times as much vitiated as that of individuals. Like a river, it is formed from many &s;treams; and like that, from all the&s;e &s;treams it may be rendered impure. Individual wickedne&s;s viti|ates public ta&s;te. Voltaire, and his cotemporary tribe of philo&s;ophi&s;ts, by con&s;tantly, &s;ilently and art|fully infu&s;ing into the minds of the French people their pernicious principles, finally corrupted the
<PB N="20" REF="035254_0019_1001B2BECEDEBB70">
whole ma&s;s of public opinion, and entirely vitiated the ta&s;te of the nation. How far this will extend, or how long it will endure, are que&s;tions too nice for human calculation. It may &s;pread round half the globe; it may be a century before the public mind can be re&s;tored to rationality. During this peri|od, and among the&s;e nations, &s;cience and virtue mu&s;t be retrogre&s;&s;ive; becau&s;e public patronage will &s;anctify and encourage private wickedne&s;s. For, if we perform actions becau&s;e men prai&s;e them, then, if virtue and &s;cience be prai&s;ed, we &s;hall be virtuous and &s;cientific; but, if vice and ignorance be prai&s;ed, we &s;hall be vicious and ignorant. National ta&s;te de|pends on national in&s;truction. Vicious writers, vi|cious preachers, and vicious teachers of children, will form a nation to reli&s;h and applaud vice. What mu&s;t be the ta&s;te of a people where &s;chools are &s;chools of athei&s;m, pulpits the pulpits of immorali|ty, and the pre&s;s groans with licen&s;ed bla&s;phemies? The &s;y&s;tem of national in&s;truction, therefore, claims the primary attention of the patriotic philo&s;opher. If, my brothers, we have any influence, hither let us direct it. A good deed here, is not a &s;olitary, unre|lated benefaction; it extends it&s;elf to millions, and pa&s;&s;es down through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations. He who &s;natches a poi&s;onous dreg from a fountain who&s;e &s;treams water a kingdom, &s;aves a nation from the deleterious ruin.</P>
<P>IF the durability of acqui&s;ition give its greate&s;t va|lue; if a belief in the &s;oul's immortality be the &s;tronge&s;t incitement to great and good actions; if this alone involves the idea of accountability, of re|wards and puni&s;hments, of hopes and fears, who&s;e ob|jects are unbounded and eternal; if the de&s;truction of this demoli&s;h the la&s;t barrier again&s;t vice, the la&s;t a&s;ylum of virtue, with what indignation ought

we to regard the modern moral revolutioni&s;ts, who explode this doctrine? The &s;oul's mortality is the fir&s;t article of their creed. They wi&s;hed to pre|pare men for deeds of enormity. This could not be done while they felt them&s;elves morally account|able. They have, therefore, laboured to convince their votaries that the clo&s;e of life is the termination of exi&s;tence. What have been the con&s;equences? Behold them in only one dreadful aggregation of facts. From this cau&s;e have originated mo&s;t of the extravagances, vices, crimes and atrocities of the French revolution. Here have been hatched, and nur|tured, and &s;ledged for &s;light, all their full grown ini|quities; &s;acrilege, bla&s;phemy and parricidal a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination, throw them&s;elves out from this foul ne&s;t of newly generated abominations, hover over Europe like flights of demons, and darken and contaminate the moral hemi&s;phere of the world.</P>
<P>WHILE, therefore, we view the extent of nature and the difficulty of excelling; while we give vigour to our energies and animate our per&s;everance with the hope of &s;elf approbation, the pro&s;pect of applau&s;e, and the certain immortality of all our mental acquire|ments, let us exalt our conceptions of human nature, correct our ta&s;te for moral beauty, purify the public mind into approbation of none but elevated actions, and repel from credibility whatever might le&s;&s;en a belief in our eternal exi&s;tence and future retribution. As mere &s;earchers after truth, we ought to do this; as friends of our&s;elves, of our nation, of humanity, we ought to do it. Deception and fanciful theory have a&s;&s;umed the robes of truth and philo&s;ophy. An all-transforming &s;pirit of innovation has &s;talked forth among the nations. He lays hold of the ma&s;&s;y ba&s;is of all philo&s;ophy, and is even now labouring to over|throw all civil, moral and religious in&s;titutions. Let

us not fall whelmed beneath their ruins; let us ri&s;e up again&s;t this dreadful demon, and triumphantly defend whatever wi&s;dom has devi&s;ed, or experience improved, or time con&s;ecrated by long hallowed and unviolated veneration.</P>
