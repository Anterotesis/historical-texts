</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the month of September 1789 a reque&s;t was forwarded through Mr. Matra, the Briti&s;h con&s;ul general at TANGIER, to his excellency General O'Hara at Gibraltar, from Muley Ab|&s;ulem, the late emperor of Morocco's favourite &s;on, the purport of which was, to intreat his ex|cellency to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end a medical gentleman from the garri&s;on to attend the prince, who&s;e health was at that time in a dangerous and declining &s;tate.</P>
<P>As the term MULEY will frequently occur in the &s;ucceeding pages, it may not be improper to &s;tate in this place, that it is a title of honour, which is confined to the <HI>royal family</HI> of Morocco, and is equivalent to that of lord, or rather <HI>prince,</HI> in our language.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="027216_0010_0FD3DFC756310F90">The promi&s;es of Muley Ab&s;ulem to the con|&s;ul were &s;plendid and encouraging. The per&s;on who was to be &s;ent on this expedition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s to be protected from every indignity, and to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">treated with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. He was to receive a liberal reward for his profe&s;&s;ional exertion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; his expences during his journey, and while he &s;taid in the country were to be punctually defrayed; and he was to be &s;ent back without delay, when|ever his pre&s;ence &s;hould be required at the gar|ri&s;on. But the mo&s;t flattering circum&s;tance which attended this requi&s;ition of the Moori&s;h prince was, the relea&s;e of certain Chri&s;tian captives who were at that period detained in &s;lavery. The&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons con&s;i&s;ted of the ma&s;ter of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el trading to Africa, and nine &s;eamen, who had been wrecked upon that part of the coa&s;t which is inhabited by the wild Arabs, and were carried into &s;lavery by that &s;avage and mercile&s;s people.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e brilliant a&s;&s;urances were fulfilled, will appear in the cour&s;e of the following narra|tive. It is &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve, that, influenced by the faith which the inhabitants of Europe are accu&s;tomed to place in the profe&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons of rank and dignity, and &s;till more im|pelled by that impetuous curio&s;ity which is natural to youth, I was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to embrace the opportunity of vi&s;iting a region &s;o little known to European travellers, and to undertake this &s;ingu|lar, and (as it was generally regarded) extremely hazardous &s;ervice.</P>
<P>However di&s;appointed I may have been in my hopes of pecuniary advantage and emolument, &s;till
<PB N="3" REF="027216_0011_0FD3DFC8D72F39F8">
I cannot at this moment regret my ra&s;hne&s;s, as it was con&s;idered by many. In the cour&s;e of my vi&s;it L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad opportunities which no European had ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">oyed of becoming acquainted with the man|ners, policy, cu&s;toms, and character of this &s;ingu|lar people. The &s;anctity of the royal harem it&s;elf was laid open to my in&s;pection. Even the dangers which I encountered, and the anxious apprehen|&s;ions which I occa&s;ionally experienced, I can now reflect upon with a degree of emotion which is not unplea&s;ant. The notes which I made upon the &s;pot I had the plea&s;ure to find proved intere&s;ting and entertaining to a number of my friends. By their per&s;ua&s;ions I have been encouraged to lay them be|fore the public; and my only and earne&s;t wi&s;h is, that the reader may not find his curio&s;ity di&s;ap|pointed, his attention wearied, or his judgment di&s;gu&s;ted, by the adventures and ob&s;ervations, which, with the mo&s;t perfect con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own inability as a writer, I &s;ubmit to his in&s;pec|tion.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preliminaries being &s;ettled, and the baggage of a &s;oldier requiring no great pre|paration, I embarked at Gibraltar the 14th Septem|ber 1789, on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and in &s;ix hours arrived at Tangier, where I immediately waited on Mr. Matra, who&s;e polite reception and kind offices during the &s;ix months that I &s;pent in Bar|bary, claim, and ever will command, my warme&s;t acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I &s;oon learned that my intended patient was, by his father's command, at the time of my arrival, at the head of an army in the mountains between Morocco and Tarudant, which obliged me to re|main
<PB N="4" REF="027216_0012_0FD3DFCA11B416D8">
at Tangier, till we received certain intel|ligence of the prince's return to Tarudant, his u&s;ual place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to determine whether &s;ur|prize o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> regret was mo&s;t predominant in my mind upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in this country. The di&s;tance is &s;o trifling, and the tran&s;ition &s;o &s;udden, that I at fir&s;t could &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that I was out of Europe, till I was convinced to the contrary by the wonderful difference of people and manners which immediately pre&s;ented it&s;elf on my entering Tangier. Civilization in mo&s;t other countries owes its origin to a commercial intercour&s;e with foreign nations; and there are few parts of the world, however di&s;tant or uninformed, who&s;e inhabitants have not, in &s;ome way or other fallen into the manners of tho&s;e foreigners by whom they are vi&s;ited. But here this circum&s;tance &s;eems to have had not the &s;malle&s;t effect; for though &s;ituated only eight leagues from Europe, in the habit of a con&s;tant communication with its inhabitants, and enjoying the advantage of a number of foreigners re&s;iding in the place, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e people of Tangier &s;till retain the &s;ame uncultivated manners, the &s;ame aver&s;ion to every kind of mental improvement by which the Moors have for ages pa&s;t been &s;o ju&s;tly characterized.</P>
<P>It is well known that the the town and fortre&s;s of TANGIER formerly con&s;tituted a part of the foreign dominions of Great Britain. While in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h it was a place of con&s;ider|able &s;trength, but when it was evacuated by the orders of Charles II. the fortifications were de|moli&s;hed, and only the ve&s;tiges of them are now
<PB N="5" REF="027216_0013_0FD3DFCF16B752A8">
vi&s;ible. There is at pre&s;ent only a &s;mall fort in tolerable repair, which is &s;ituated at the northern extremity of the town, and a battery of a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> guns which fronts the bay. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it is evident that it could make only a very weak re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t any powerful attack.</P>
<P>The town, which occupies a very &s;mall &s;pace of ground, and affords nothing remarkable, is built upon an eminence which appears to ri&s;e out of the &s;ea, and is &s;urrounded with a wall. The land for a &s;mall di&s;tance round it is laid out into vineyards, orchards, and corn-fields, beyond which are tracts of &s;and, with lofty and barren hills. The &s;itua|tion is therefore far from beautiful or agreeable. The hou&s;es are in general mean and ill furni&s;hed, the roofs are quite flat, and both the&s;e and the walls are entirely whitened over; the apartments are all on the ground floor, as there is no &s;econd &s;tory.</P>
<P>Contrary to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom in Barbary, the Moors and Jews live intermixed at TANGIER, and maintain a more friendly intercour&s;e than el&s;ewhere in this quarter of the globe. The Jews al&s;o, in&s;tead of going bare-footed by compul&s;ion, as at Morocco, Tarudant, and many other places, are only required to do it when pa&s;&s;ing a &s;treet where there is a mo&s;que or a &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>The foreign con&s;uls (except the French who has a hou&s;e at Sallee) re&s;ide at Tangier. Be|fore the reign of the late emperor Sidi Mahomet, they were allowed to live at Tetuan, a town greatly preferable to Tangier, as well on account of the inhabitants being more civiziled, as of the beauty of the adjacent country. A &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="6" REF="027216_0014_0FD3DFD1034547C0">
occa&s;ioned the expul&s;ion of the Chri|&s;tians from that plea&s;ant retreat:&mdash;An European gentleman was amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;hooting at &s;ome birds in the vicinity of the town, and acci|dentally wounded an old Moori&s;h woman, who unfortunately happened to be within reach of the &s;hot. Upon this accident the late emperor &s;wore by his beard that no Chri&s;tian &s;hould ever again enter the town of Tetuan. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader that this oath (by the beard) is held by the Moors in &s;uch &s;olemn e&s;timation, that they are rarely ob&s;erved to violate it, nor was the late emperor ever known to di&s;regard it in a &s;ingle in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of con&s;uls, indeed, in this di&s;tant and uncivilized country, is by no means to be en|vied; and the recompence which &s;hould induce men of liberal education to &s;acrifice their native comforts and advantages to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of life as is required here, ought not to be trifling. They can form no &s;ociety but among them&s;elves; and even the univer&s;ally allowed law of nations is frequent-in&s;ufficient to protect their per&s;ons from in&s;ult. Subject to the caprice of an emperor who&s;e conduct is regulated by no law, and who&s;e mind is govern|ed by no fixed principle, they are often ordered up to court, and after experiencing a very tedious, fatiguing and expen&s;ive journey, they are frequent|ly &s;ent back again without having effected the &s;malle&s;t point to the advantage of their own coun|try, &s;ometimes indeed without even being informed of the purpo&s;e of their journey.</P>

country hou&s;es at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Tangier, where they occa&s;ionally retire, and enjoy tho&s;e amu&s;ements which the country affords. The&s;e are chiefly gardening, fi&s;hing, and hunting. From the plenty of game of every kind with which the country abounds, and and a total freedom from any re&s;triction with re&s;pect to it (for there are no game laws in this empire) they give a full &s;cope to the plea&s;ures of the field, and endeavour by tho&s;e means to procure a &s;ub&s;titute for the want of friend|ly and cheerful &s;ociety.</P>
<P>On the northern &s;ide of Tangier is the ca&s;tle, which though very exten&s;ive, lies half in ruins. It has a royal trea&s;ury, and is the re&s;idence of the governor. Near the water-&s;ide are &s;torehou&s;es for the refitting of ve&s;&s;els, and at this port many of the emperor's row-gallies are built. A number of them al&s;o are generally laid up here, when not engaged in actual &s;ervice. Indeed, from its con|venient &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the Straits, this is the be&s;t &s;ea-port that he has for employing to ad|vantage the&s;e &s;mall ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The bay is &s;ufficiently &s;pacious, but it is dange|rous for &s;hipping in a &s;trong ea&s;terly wind. The mo&s;t &s;ecure place for anchorage is on the ea&s;tern part of the bay, about half a mile from &s;hore, in a line with the round tower and the Spani&s;h con&s;ul's hou&s;e, which makes a very con&s;picuous ap|pearance from the bay.</P>
<P>On the &s;outhern &s;ide of the bay is the river, where, before it was choaked up with &s;and-banks, the emperor u&s;ed to winter his large &s;hips, which he is now obliged to &s;end to Larache. Mo&s;t of the rivers in the emperor's dominions, which were
<PB N="8" REF="027216_0016_0FD3DFD2522923B0">
formerly navigable, and well calculated for the the fitting out of ve&s;&s;els, and for the laying of them up in &s;afety, have now their mouths &s;o con|tinually filling with &s;and, that in a cour&s;e of years &s;mall fi&s;hing boats only will be able to enter them. It has often occurred to me, that an enquiry into the &s;tate of the emperor's navy, and in particular into the inconvenience of his harbours, might be an object of &s;ome con&s;equence to the different Eu|ropean powers, who now conde&s;cend to pay a mo&s;t di&s;graceful tribute to this &s;hadow of imperial dig|nity.</P>
<P>Over the river of Tangier are the ruins of an ancient bridge, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erected by the Romans. The centre of it only is de&s;troyed, and that does not &s;eem to be the effect of time. It more probably was pulled down by the Moors, for the purpo&s;e of permitting their ve&s;&s;els to enter the river. The remainder of it is entire, and by its thickne&s;s and &s;olidity it evinces the excellence of the ancient architects, and &s;hews that &s;trength, as well as beauty, made a con&s;iderable part of their &s;tudy.</P>
<P>As I propo&s;e in a future part of this Narrative to de&s;cribe very particularly the architecture, hou&s;es, furniture, &amp;c. in this country, I &s;hall conclude my account of Tangier by ob&s;erving, that in time of peace it carries on a &s;mall trade with Gibraltar and the neighbouring coa&s;t of Spain, by &s;upplying tho&s;e places with provi&s;ions, and receiving in return European commodities of almo&s;t every kind.</P>
<P>In a fortnight after my arrival at Tangier the con&s;ul received a letter from the prince, infor|ming him of his return to Tarudant, and of his

<P>Two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;emen of the Black or Negro cavalry, armed with long mu&s;kets and &s;abres, were di&s;|patched by the prince to e&s;cort me, and had been waiting for that purpo&s;e for &s;ome time. The go|vernor of the town had orders to &s;upply me with a tent, mules, and an interpreter. But it was not without much difficulty that a per&s;on could be found in Tangier who could &s;peak the English and Arabic languages &s;ufficiently well to perform that office; and it was owing to an accident that I at length was enabled to obtain one.</P>
<P>After &s;earching the whole town in vain, the go|vernor ordered, during the Jewi&s;h hour of prayer, that enquiries &s;hould be made among all the &s;yna|gogues for a per&s;on who under&s;tood both lan|guages. An unfortunate Jew, who&s;e occupation was that of &s;elling fruit about the &s;treets at Gib|raltar, and who had come to Tangier merely to &s;pend a few days with his wife and family during a Jewi&s;h fe&s;tival, being unacquainted with the in|tent of the enquiry, unguardedly an&s;wered in the affirmative. Without further ceremony the poor man was dragged away from his friends and home, and con&s;trained by force to accompany me.</P>
<P>Of the mode in this de&s;potic government of &s;eizing per&s;ons at the arbitrary plea&s;ure of a go|vernor, an Engli&s;hman can &s;carcely form an idea. Three or four lu&s;ty Moors, with large clubs in their hands, gra&s;p the wretched and defencele&s;s

<P>From the &s;udden and abrupt manner in which he was hurried away, in the mid&s;t of his devotions, the women immediately took the alarm, flew in a body to the hou&s;e of the con&s;ul, and with &s;hrieks and lamentations endeavoured to prevail on him to get the man excu&s;ed from his journey. The immen&s;e di&s;tance, and the ill treatment which they knew was offered to Jews by the Moors, when not under &s;ome civilized controul, were certainly &s;ufficient motives for this alarm on the part of the women. Upon the con&s;ul's a&s;&s;uring them, how|ever, that the wife &s;hould be taken care of, and the hu&s;band &s;ent back without any expence to him on our arrival at Mogodore, where I was to be furni&s;hed with another interpreter, and upon my promi&s;ing to protect the Jew from in&s;ult, and, if he behaved well, to reward him for his trouble, the women immediately di&s;per&s;ed, and returned home apparently &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>When this bu&s;ine&s;s was completed, the con&s;ul furni&s;hed me with a proper quantity of liquors, two days provi&s;ions, a bead&s;tead formed by three folding &s;tools, for the conveniency of packing it on the mules, with proper cooking uten&s;ils, and an oil-&s;kin ca&s;e to carry my bedding.

The country through which we pa&s;&s;ed, after quitting the neighbourhood of Tangier, was barren and mountainous, with &s;carcely any inhabitants; and it countinued &s;o the whole way to Larache, only a few mi&s;erable hamlets pre&s;enting them&s;elves occa&s;ionally to our view. The villages throughout this empire con|&s;i&s;t of huts rudely con&s;tructed of &s;tones, earth, and canes, covered with thatch, and enclo&s;ed with thick and high hedges. This de&s;cription exactly applies to that which received us on the fir&s;t even|ing of our expedition.</P>
<P>So careful had the governor of Tangier been in executing his commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o attentive to the accommodation of the per&s;on who was to re&s;tore health to his royal ma&s;ter's favourite &s;on, that upon examining my tent, it was found &s;o full of holes, and in every re&s;pect &s;o out of order, that I was obliged to place my bed under a hedge, and make u&s;e of my tattered tent as a &s;ide cover|ing.</P>
<P>After &s;pending the night in this &s;ingular &s;itua|tion, we proceeded on our journey at half pa&s;t &s;even in the morning, and in an hour after cro&s;&s;ed the river Marha, which was nearly dry; though I was informed that after the heavy rains it is deep and dangerous to be forded. In a wet &s;ea&s;on,

the rivers are &s;welled, travellers are frequently detained for &s;everal days upon their banks. There are in fact but very few bridges in this country, so that, except at the &s;ea-ports, where they have boats, there is no method of pa&s;&s;ing &s;treams which are too deep to be forded, except by &s;wimming, or by the u&s;e of rafts.</P>
<P>At ten we entered a thick and exten&s;ive fore&s;t, named Rabe a Clow. From its &s;ituation on a high mountain, from the rocky and difficult a&s;cent, and from the di&s;tant view of the ocean through the openings of the trees, this fore&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">refe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o us an uncommonly wild, romantic, and, I may with truth &s;ay, a &s;ublime appearance. From this pro&s;pect, however, our attention was in a great mea&s;ure diverted by the mi&s;erable road over which we now found we were to pa&s;s, extending for the mo&s;t part over &s;teep mountains and craggy rocks. On this account we were obliged to ride very &s;low, and with the greate&s;t caution.</P>
<P>At eleven we cro&s;&s;ed another river, called Ma|chira la chef, running at the bottom of this ele|vated fore&s;t, which, though the &s;ea&s;on was dry, was rather deep. Here the eye was agreeably refre&s;hed, by a fine champaigne country, and a good road before us. On this we continued until we arrived at a rivulet with &s;ome trees growing at a &s;mall di&s;tance from its margin. At noon I fixed upon the mo&s;t &s;hady &s;pot I could find, and, agreeably to the Moori&s;h fa&s;hion, &s;at down cro&s;s-legged on the gra&s;s and dined.</P>

to eat cold the following day. Such repa&s;ts in fre&s;co were agreeable enough, when whole&s;ome and palatable water could be procured; but very frequently that was far from being the ca&s;e. In many places it was &s;o muddy and offen&s;ive, that, though extremely thir&s;ty, I could not drink it un|le&s;s corrected with wine.</P>
<P>Except in the large towns, no provi&s;ions could be procured but fowls and eggs; with the&s;e, which I had been before accu&s;tomed to e&s;teem as delicacies, I now began to be &s;atiated and di&s;|gu&s;ted. My u&s;ual &s;upper upon my rout was a cup of &s;trong coffee and a toa&s;t, which I found much more refre&s;hing than animal food. Every morn|ing I breakfa&s;ted upon the &s;ame, and experienced the invigorating effects of this beverage, by its enabling me to &s;upport the fatigues of the day.</P>
<P>After pur&s;uing our cour&s;e for about two hours, we arrived at the river Lorifa, where we were detained an hour by the height of the tide. The uncertainty and unevenne&s;s of the bottom, and the number of large &s;tones which lie in the channel of this river, render it at all times un&s;afe to be pa&s;&s;ed. This circum&s;tance we very &s;en&s;ibly ex|perienced; for when the tide permitted us to make the attempt, though we had men on foot for the purpo&s;e of guiding our bea&s;ts, &s;till by their &s;triking again&s;t the &s;tones, and by their &s;udden plunges into deep holes, we were continually thrown for|ward upon their necks.</P>
<P>Hardine&s;s and dexterity are, perhaps, the fir&s;t among the few advantages which uncivilized na|tions enjoy. It was amu&s;ing in this place to ob|&s;erve a number of Moors, who were travelling

on foot, pull off their cloaths, place them com|modiou&s;ly on their heads, and immediately &s;wim acro&s;s the &s;tream.</P>
<P>In the evening we reached Arzilla, where, in con&s;equence of the &s;ervice in which I was engaged, application was made by the &s;oldiers to the Al|caide, or governor of the town, to procure me a lodging. Arzilla is eleven hours journey, or about thirty miles di&s;tant from Tangier: for the Moors compute di&s;tances by hours; and as the pace of their mules is at the rate of three miles an hour, the length of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> journey is generally calcu|lated in this way with &s;ufficient accuracy.</P>
<P>The apartment a&s;&s;igned me was a mi&s;erable room in the ca&s;tle, without any windows, and re|ceiving light from a door-way (for there was no door) and from three holes in the wall about &s;ix inches &s;quare. This ca&s;tle covers a large &s;pace of ground; and though it is now in a very ruinous condition, appears to have been a building erect|ed formerly in a &s;uperior &s;tile of Moori&s;h gran|deur.</P>
<P>The town is a &s;mall &s;ea-port upon the Atlantic ocean. It was once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Por|tugueze, and was at that time a place of &s;trength; but through the indolence and caprice of the Moori&s;h princes its fortifications have been &s;ince neglected, and its walls are rapidly decaying in almo&s;t every part. The hou&s;es have a mi&s;erable appearance, and the inhabitants, who con&s;i&s;t of a few Moors and Jews, live in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t perfect poverty.</P>
<P>The reader may form &s;ome idea of the manners of this country, by imagining me and my interpre|ter
<PB N="15" REF="027216_0023_0FD3DFDE5CD7D1D0">
at one end of the room, as above de&s;cribed, drinking coffee; and at the other, the muleteer and the &s;oldiers enjoying them&s;elves over a large bowl of Cu&s;ca&s;ou, which they were devouring with all the fervour of an excellent appetite, and in the primitive fa&s;hion, that is with their fingers. This &s;pecies of food is very common among the Moors, who have a tradition that it was invented by their prophet Mahomet, at a time when he could ob|tain neither &s;leep nor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. It is their prin|cipal treat to all foreign mini&s;ters, and travellers of di&s;tinction who vi&s;it the country. It con&s;i&s;ts of bits of pa&s;te about the &s;ize of rice, crumbled in|to an earthen colander, and cooked by the &s;team of boiled meat and vegetables. The whole is then put into an earthen di&s;h, and butter and &s;pices added to it. The di&s;h is &s;erved up in a wooden tray, with a cover of palmetto leaves plaited to|gether.</P>
<P>About an hour after my arrival the governor, and &s;everal of the principal Moors, paid me a vi&s;it, and brought me, in compliment to my royal patient, a pre&s;ent of fruit, eggs, and fowls. After a con|ver&s;ation of about half an hour, during which many compliments pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides, my vi&s;itors took their leave, and we all retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>As the report was rapidly and exten&s;ively cir|culated that a Chri&s;tian &s;urgeon was arrived in the town, I found my&s;elf vi&s;ited very early in the morning by a number of patients, who&s;e ca&s;es were in general truly deplorable. Many of the&s;e objects were afflicted with total blindne&s;s, white &s;wellings, inveterate chronical rheumati&s;ms, and
<PB N="16" REF="027216_0024_0FD3DFDFD0EAB428">
drop&s;ies. It was in vain to a&s;&s;ure the&s;e unfortu|nate and ignorant people that their complaints were beyond the reach of medicine. All I could allege gained not the &s;malle&s;t credit; a Chri&s;tian doctor, they a&s;&s;erted, could cure every malady, and repeatedly offered me their hands to feel their pul&s;e; for di&s;ea&s;es of every kind in this country, it &s;eems, are to be di&s;covered merely by an applica|tion to the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>From the urgent importunities of my patients, who all wi&s;hed to be attended to at the &s;ame time, I was at fir&s;t at a lo&s;s how to proceed; however, I found my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering my guards to keep off the crowd, and permit one only to con&s;ult me at a time. It was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to ob&s;erve &s;o many objects of real mi&s;ery before me, without having it in my power to admini&s;ter that relief for which they appeared &s;o anxious, and which they were &s;o confident of obtaining. Though mo&s;t of their complaints appeared to be incurable, yet had my time permitted I &s;hould have expe|rienced the mo&s;t heart-felt plea&s;ure in exerting every means in my power to alleviate their &s;uffer|ings. Circum&s;tanced as I was, I could only re|commend them medicines which could have but a temporary effect, and which &s;erved rather to &s;end them away &s;atisfied than to afford a perma|nent relief.</P>
<P>In the mean time the governor had been paying attention to the bad condition of my tent, and by ordering the wor&s;t parts to be cut out, and the re&s;t to be patched, had reduced it &s;o much in &s;ize that he had &s;carcely left room for my&s;elf and interpreter with difficulty to creep into it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on my arrival at Larache I was introduced to the Alcaide or governor, whom I found to be a very hand&s;ome black. He &s;hewed me great attention, and placed me in a very decent apartment in the ca&s;tle, which is in a &s;tate totally different from that of Arzilla.</P>
<P>Larache formerly belonged to the Spaniards; it has tolerably neat buildings, and is of a mode|rate extent. This city is &s;ituated at the mouth of the river Luccos, upon an ea&s;y de&s;cent to the &s;ea. The agreeable windings of the river, the clu&s;ters of date and various other trees irregularly di&s;po&s;ed, and the gentle ri&s;ings of the ground, have a mo&s;t picture&s;que effect; which, aided by the reflection that your are contemplating the pure works of nature, una&s;&s;i&s;ted or undeformed by art, cannot fail to in&s;pire the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The town, though not regularly fortified, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es one fort and two batteries in good repair. The &s;treets are paved, and there is a decent market|place with &s;tone piazzas. This city indeed on the whole exhibits a much cleaner and neater appear|ance
<PB N="19" REF="027216_0027_0FD3DFE4CA4E7550">
than any town which I vi&s;ited in Barbary, Mogodore excepted.</P>
<P>At the port ve&s;&s;els are refitted and &s;upplied with &s;tores, though there are no docks nor con|veniencies for building large &s;hips. From the depth and &s;ecurity of the river the emperor is in|duced to lay up his large ve&s;&s;els at Larache during the winter &s;ea&s;on. It indeed is the only port which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that can an&s;wer that purpo&s;e. It is however probable, that this river in proce&s;s of time will be &s;ubject to the &s;ame inconvenience as that of Tangier, owing to the accumulation of &s;and, which already has produced a bar at its en|trance, of which the annual increa&s;e is very per|ceptible.</P>
<P>As one of my mules had fallen lame, I con|tinued the whole of the following day at LARACHE, with a view of exchanging him; but to my great mortification was not able to &s;ucceed in the at|tempt. During a great part of the day my room was &s;o filled with patients that it might with great propriety be compared to an infirmary, and that not one of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es that I ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t prevalent, were the hydrocele; violent inflammmations in the eyes, very frequently terminating in blind|ne&s;s; the itch, combined with inveterate leprous affections; drop&s;ies, and white &s;wellings. I al&s;o ob&s;erved a few intermittent and billious fevers, and frequently complaints of the &s;tomach, ari&s;ing from indige&s;tion. Though this country has in a few in&s;tances been vi&s;ited by the plague, yet that di&s;ea&s;e by no means is &s;o prevalent here as in the Ea&s;tern parts of Barbary, which are more con|tiguous
<PB N="20" REF="027216_0028_0FD3DFE9D039C730">
to Turkey, whence it is &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;ually to proceed.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the hydrocele &s;o frequently occur|ring in this country &s;eems to be in a great mea&s;ure the loo&s;e dre&s;s of the Moors, and the great relaxa|tion which is induced by the warmth of the cli|mate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The medical reader will probably &s;ee a further cau&s;e for the frequency of this complaint, in the great indulgence which the Moors allow them&s;elves in certain plea&s;ures, and the application of the warm bath immediately after.</NOTE> The ophthalmy, or inflammation of the eyes, is evidently occa&s;ioned by their being expo&s;ed to the reflection of the &s;un from the hou&s;es, which are univer&s;ally whitened over. To this inconveni|ence the Moors are more particularly &s;ubject, from their dre&s;s not being calculated to keep off the rays of the &s;un, and from no per&s;on being allowed the u&s;e of an umbrella except the emperor.</P>
<P>The leprous affection appears to be hereditary, for I was informed that it has been frequently traced back from one family to another for &s;everal generations, and it has all the appearance of being the true lepro&s;y of the antients. It breaks out in great blotches over the whole body, in &s;ome few forming one continual &s;ore, which frequently heals up, and at &s;tated times breaks out afre&s;h, but is never thoroughly cured. During my re&s;idence at Morocco, I had frequent opportunities of trying a variety of remedies for this complaint, but I never &s;ucceeded further than a temporary cure, for upon di&s;continuing the medicines the di&s;ea&s;e was certain to return. The white &s;wellings and drop&s;ies probably ari&s;e from poor living; three

parts of the people &s;eldom having any other kind of provi&s;ion than coar&s;e bread, fruit, and vegeta|bles.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;tate of medical and chirur|gical knowledge in this country, it is very limited indeed. They have, however, their practitioners in phy&s;ic, both Moors and Jews, who have gone through the form of fitting them&s;elves for the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in &s;electing from the antient Arabic manu&s;cripts that remain in the coun|try &s;ome &s;imple remedies, which they afterwards apply, as well as they are able, to various di&s;tem|pers.</P>
<P>Their methods of treating di&s;orders are, bleed|ing, cupping, &s;carifying, fomentations, and giving internally decoctions of herbs. Some are bold enough in the hydrocele to let out the water with a lancet; and there are tho&s;e who even couch for the cataract. I never had an opportunity of &s;eeing the operation of couching performed in Barbary, but I was introduced to a Moor at the city of Mo|rocco, who told me that he had performed it, and &s;hewed me the in&s;trument which he u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. This was a piece of thick bra&s;s wire, terminating gradually at one end in a point not very &s;harp.</P>
<P>The Moors chiefly depend upon topical reme|dies, and &s;eldom make u&s;e of internal medicines. Being &s;trangers to the manner in which they are to operate, they &s;eem to entertain no favourable opinion of their efficacy. It is indeed almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade them that a medicine received into the &s;tomach can relieve complaints in the head or extremities. It is but ju&s;tice, however, to add,
<PB N="22" REF="027216_0030_0FD3DFED55151458">
that I never knew them object to any thing that I admini&s;tered, provided I clearly explained to them the manner in which they were to be benefited by it. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and from the frequent recour&s;e which the Mahometans have to charms and amulets, it appears that, notwith|&s;tanding their belief in prede&s;tination, they are not aver&s;e to the u&s;e of means for the removal of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Of the number who applied to me for relief at Larache, none appeared to exhibit the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude except one; the re&s;t behaved as if they thought they did me a greater favour by a&s;king my advice, than I conferred on them by giving it. The per&s;on to whom I allude, as being &s;o different in his conduct from the re&s;t, was an old Moor of &s;ome di&s;tinction in the place, who de&s;ired me to come to his hou&s;e and vi&s;it a &s;ick friend, with which reque&s;t I immediately complied. The ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for this trifling attention was &s;o uncommonly gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ful, that reflecting on the place where I was, and on the treatment I had already experienced, I was a&s;toni&s;hed and gratified beyound expre&s;&s;ion. After &s;ending to my apartment a large &s;upply of poultry and fruit, the u&s;ual pre&s;ent of the country, he waited on me him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ured me, that while he lived he &s;hould never forget the favour which I had done him; at the &s;ame time in&s;i&s;ting upon my making u&s;e of his hou&s;e as my own upon my return. As this was the principal in&s;tance of this very &s;ingular virtue among the Moors, which I expe|rienced during my whole tour in Barbary, I have thought it my duty to be particular in mentioning the circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="027216_0031_0FD3DFF0A2EE4E78">On the 4th of October, at &s;ix in the morning, we left Larache, and at ten pa&s;&s;ed the river Clough, a &s;mall &s;tream. At four in the afternoon we came to the ruins of a large ca&s;tle, &s;aid to have been built &s;ome hundred years ago, by a Moor of di&s;tinction, named Dar Core&s;y, who was put to death by the then reigning emperor, and his ca&s;tle de&s;troyed. Mo&s;t of the ca&s;tles and other public buildings in|deed, which I &s;aw in this empire, afforded &s;trong marks of having &s;uffered more from the hands of the tyrant, than from the injuries of time.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the beautiful pro&s;pects in the country adjacent to Larache: tho&s;e in the road from that city to Mamora were not le&s;s de|lightful. We travelled among trees of various kinds, &s;o agreeably arranged that the place had more the appearance of a park than of an unculti|vated country. We cro&s;&s;ed over plains which, without the aid of the hu&s;bandman, were rich in verdure; and we had a view of lakes which ex|tended many miles in length, the &s;ides of which were lined with Arab encampments, and their &s;ur|faces covered with innumerable water-fowl. The finene&s;s of the day greatly added to the plea&s;ure I received from the&s;e variegated &s;cenes, which are not unworthy the pencil of the able&s;t arti&s;t.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t four in the aftenoon we arrived at the fir&s;t of the&s;e lakes, and pitched our tent in the centre of one of the encampments.</P>
<P>The&s;e encampments are generally at a very con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the cities and towns; the villages, on the other hand, are commonly quite in the vicinity of &s;ome town. The encampment con&s;i&s;ts of broad tents, con&s;tructed either of the
<PB N="24" REF="027216_0032_0FD3DFF1D95C10C0">
leaves of the palmetto, or of camels hair. Some of them are &s;upported by canes, and others are fixed by pegs. The form of an Arab tent is in &s;ome degree &s;imilar to a tomb, or the keel of a &s;hip rever&s;ed. They are dyed black, are broad, and very low. The tent of the Shaik or governor is con&s;iderably larger than any of the others, and is placed in a con&s;picuous part of the camp. The&s;e camps are named by the Arabs Douhars, and the number of tents in them vary according to the pro|portion of people in the tribe or family. Some of the Douhars contain only four or five, while others con&s;i&s;t of near a hundred. The camp forms either a complete circle or an oblong &s;quare, but the fir&s;t is more common. The cattle, which are left to graze at large in the day, are carefully &s;ecured within the boundaries at night.</P>
<P>In all the camps the tents are clo&s;ed on the North &s;ide, and are quite open on the South, by which means they e&s;cape the cold Northerly winds, &s;o prevalent in this country during the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Arabs who inhabit the&s;e encampments are in many re&s;pects a very different race of people from the Moors who inhabit the towns. The latter, from being in general more affluent, from their intercour&s;e with Europeans, and from their different education, have introduced luxuries, and imbibed ideas, of which the others are entirely ignorant. From their &s;trong family attachments indeed, as well as from their inveterate prejudices in favour of antient cu&s;toms, the&s;e tribes of Arabs appear to be at a va&s;t di&s;tance from a &s;tate of civi|lization. As this &s;ingular people a&s;&s;ociate con|tinually
<PB N="25" REF="027216_0033_0FD3DFF5771F0DB0">
in tribes, their marriages are confined to their own family; and &s;o &s;trict are they in the ob|&s;ervance of this attachment, that they will not per|mit a per&s;on who is not is &s;ome degree related to them to inhabit the &s;ame camp with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band, wife, and children all &s;leep in the &s;ame tent, commonly on a pallet of &s;heep-&s;kins, but &s;ometimes on the bare ground. The children remain with their parents till they marry, when the friends of each party are obliged to provide them with a tent, a &s;tone hand-mill to grind their corn, a ba&s;ket, a wooden bowl, and two earthen di&s;hes, which con&s;titute the whole of their furni|ture. Be&s;ides the&s;e they have, however, a mar|riage portion, which con&s;i&s;ts of a certain number of camels, hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep, and goats, with a proportionable quantity of wheat and barley: and by grazing and cultivating the neighbouring ground they gradually increa&s;e their &s;tock. The Arabs have &s;eldom more than one wife. Their women, who are in general the very oppo&s;ite to every idea of beauty, do not, like tho&s;e who in|habit the towns, conceal their faces in the pre|&s;ence of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>Each camp is under the direction of a SHAIK, to whom the re&s;t apply for redre&s;s whenever they feel them&s;elves aggrieved. This governor is in|ve&s;ted with the power of inflicting any puni&s;h|ment which he may think proper, &s;hort of death. He is appointed by the emperor, and is in general the Arab who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t property.</P>
<P>As they are generally at a di&s;tance from any mo&s;que where they can exerci&s;e their religion, an empty tent is allotted for the purpo&s;es of wor&s;hip,
<PB N="26" REF="027216_0034_0FD3DFF96970F688">
which is placed in the centre of the camp, and which at the &s;ame time &s;erves for the nightly a|bode of any traveller who may pa&s;s tnat way; and tho&s;e who take &s;helter in it are provided with a good &s;upper, at the expence of the whole a&s;&s;ocia|tion. Within this tent all the children a&s;&s;emble every morning an hour before day-break, before a large wood fire, which is made on the out&s;ide, and learn their prayers, which are written in Ara|bic characters on boards, and are always hanging up in the tent. The learning to read the few pray|ers which are on the&s;e boards, and to commit them to memory, is the only education to which the Arabs in general ever attain.</P>
<P>The un&s;ettled turn of the&s;e people has con|ferred upon them the appellation of wandering Arabs. As &s;oon as the land which &s;urrounds them becomes le&s;s productive, and their cattle have de|voured all the pa&s;ture, they &s;trike their tents, and move on to &s;ome more fertile &s;pot, till nece&s;&s;ity again compels them to retire. I met one of the&s;e tribes upon their march, and ob&s;erved that not only their camels, hor&s;es, and mules, but al&s;o their bulls and cows, were laden with their tents, im|plements o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> agriculture, wives and children, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the empire of Morocco all landed property, except what is immediately connected with towns, belongs to the emperor. The Arabs, therefore, when they wi&s;h to change their &s;ituation, are obli|ged to procure a licence from him, or at lea&s;t from the ba&s;haw of the province, allowing them to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any particular &s;pot of ground; and in con&s;ideration of this indulgence they pay the emperor a proportion of its produce.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="027216_0035_0FD3DFF96E42F4E0">The treatment which I experienced from the&s;e people was kind and ho&s;pitable, betraying no &s;igns of that inclination to impo&s;e upon &s;trangers, which &s;o &s;trongly mark the character of the inhabitants of the towns. As &s;oon as my tent was pitched, numbers flocked round it, but apparently more from curio&s;ity than from any intention of offend|ing. On the contrary, they appeared exceedingly de&s;irous to do every thing in their power for my accommodation.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men con&s;i&s;ts of a long coar&s;e frock, made of undyed wool, which is girt about the wai&s;t, and is called a Ca&s;hove. In addition to this they wear the Haick, which is a piece of &s;tuff &s;everal yards in length, made either of wool, or wool and cotton. This, when they go abroad, they u&s;e as a cloak, throwing it over the whole of the under-dre&s;s in a carele&s;s manner, the up|per part &s;erving to cover their head. They wear their hair cut quite clo&s;e, u&s;e no turban, cap, nor &s;tockings, and &s;eldom even wear &s;lippers.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women is nearly the &s;ame, dif|fering only in the mode of putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Ca&s;|hove, which is &s;o contrived as to form a bag on their backs, for the purpo&s;e of carrying their chil|dren; and this they are able to do, and perform all the drudgery of the family at the &s;ame time. Their hair, which is black, is worn in different plaits, and is covered with a handkerchief tied close to their head. They are very fond of gold and &s;ilver trinkets when they can obtain them, and none of them are without a number of bead necklaces. Their children go quite naked till the
<PB N="28" REF="027216_0036_0FD3DFFB0A6A0BD0">
age of nine or ten, when they are initiated in the drudgery of their parents.</P>
<P>The mode of living among&s;t the&s;e people is much the &s;ame as that of the Moors in towns, cu&s;co&s;ou being their principal diet. Be&s;ides this, however, they eat camels and foxes fle&s;h, and &s;ometimes even cats have fallen victims to their voracity. They u&s;e barley bread, which is pre|pared without yea&s;t or leaven, and baken in an earthen di&s;h in the &s;hape of a cake.</P>
<P>The complexion of the Arabs is a dark brown, or rather olive-colour. Their features, from their mere active life, have &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion and few|er marks of effeminacy than tho&s;e of the Moors in towns. Their eyes are black, and their teeth in general white and regular.</P>
<P>The ill effects of &s;trong family prejudices, and of that narrow and exclu&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition which ac|companies them, is &s;trongly marked in the&s;e little &s;ocieties. Every camp beholds its neighbour with dete&s;tation or contempt. Perpetual feuds ari&s;e be|tween the inhabitants of each, and too commonly are productive of blood&s;hed, and the mo&s;t extra|vagant outrages. When one of the&s;e unfortunate conte&s;ts proceeds to open acts of violence, it &s;el|dom terminates till the emperor has taken a &s;hare in the di&s;pute. Whoever is the author, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e at lea&s;t generally derives advantage from the&s;e di&s;|&s;en&s;ions; for, independent of the corporal puni&s;h|ment which he inflicts, he al&s;o impo&s;es heavy fines upon the contending tribes, which proves the mo&s;t effectual mode of pacifying the combatants.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what the emperor gains in this way, which is frequently con&s;iderable, he likewi&s;e re|ceives
<PB N="29" REF="027216_0037_0FD3DFFC56173A48">
annually the tenth of every article of con|&s;umption which is the produce of the country; he al&s;o &s;ometimes exacts an extraordinary impo&s;t, an|&s;wering in value to about the fortieth part of eve|ry article they po&s;&s;e&s;s, which is levied for the pur|po&s;e of &s;upporting his troops. Be&s;ides the&s;e levies, the&s;e unfortunate people are liable to any other ex|action which his caprice may direct him to impo&s;e upon them, from a plea of pretended or real ne|ce&s;&s;ity. The fir&s;t tax (the tenth) is paid either in corn and cattle, or in money. The other is al|ways paid in corn and cattle.</P>
<P>The mode practi&s;ed by the emperor for extort|ing money from his &s;ubjects is very &s;imple and ex|peditions. He &s;ends orders to the ba&s;haw or go|vernor of the province to pay him the &s;um he wants within a limited time. The ba&s;haw immediately collects it, and &s;ometimes double the &s;um, as a re|ward to his own indu&s;try, from the Alcaides of the towns and Shaiks of the encampments in the province which he commands. The example of the ba&s;haw is not lo&s;t upon the&s;e officers, who take care to compen&s;ate their own trouble with equal liberality from the pockets of the &s;ubjects; &s;o that by means of this chain of de&s;poti&s;m, which de&s;cends from the emperor to the meane&s;t officer, the wretched people generally pay about four times the taxes which the emperor receives&mdash;&s;o little gainers are arbitrary monarchs by the oppre&s;|&s;ion of the public! The exactions indeed have been &s;ometimes &s;o &s;evere, that the Arabs have po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;atisfy the emperor's demands, and have obliged him to &s;end a party of &s;oldiers to enforce them. Whenever he is forced to this extremity,
<PB N="30" REF="027216_0038_0FD3DFFDCFE68E80">
the &s;oldiers never fail to give full &s;cope to their love of plunder.</P>
<P>When a &s;tranger &s;leeps in one of the&s;e camps, he re&s;ts in the mo&s;t perfect &s;afety; for if he lo&s;es the lea&s;t article, or is in any re&s;pect injured, all the Arabs of the camp become an&s;werable for it. So that a foreigner travels with much greater &s;ecuri|ty under the protection of government in this em|pire, than among the nations of Europe which are more civilized.</P>
<P>The lakes in this part of the world furni&s;h great plenty of water-fowl and eels. The manner of catching the latter being in &s;ome degree curi|ous, I &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's patience while I endeavour to give &s;ome account of it.</P>
<P>A &s;ort of &s;kiff, about &s;ix feet long and two broad, is formed of bundles of reeds and ru&s;hes, rudely joined together, leaving only &s;ufficient room to contain one man. The &s;kiff gradually narrows off towards the head, where it terminates in a point, which is bent upwards in a manner &s;imilar to the turn of a &s;cate. It is guided and managed entirely by one long pole, and from its lightne&s;s is capable of very quick motion. For the imme|diate purpo&s;e of taking the eels, a number of &s;trong canes are fixed together, with a barbed iron in each, and with this in&s;trument, as &s;oon as the eels are ob&s;erved in the water, the man im|mediately &s;trikes at them with great dexterity, and generally with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole employment of the Arabs con|&s;i&s;ts in the tillage of the ground adjacent to their camps, and in the grazing of their cattle. The grounds at a di&s;tance from the lakes, by the burn|ing
<PB N="31" REF="027216_0039_0FD3DFFF9F9BD7B8">
of the &s;tubble in the autumn, and a &s;light turn|ing up of the earth with a wooden plough-&s;hare, produce good crops of barley and wheat; and by the&s;e means the Arabs procure not only &s;ufficient for their con&s;umption, but are even enabled to bring a part for &s;ale to the neighbouring markets. Near the mar&s;hes and lakes their flocks and herds find a very rich pa&s;ture, which from the number of every &s;pecies which I ob&s;erved, added in no &s;mall degree to the beauty of the romantic &s;cene.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their markets, they have &s;pots of ground fixed upon for that purpo&s;e within a few hours ride of their habitations, where once a week all the neighbouring Arabs tran&s;port their cattle, poultry, fruit, and corn, to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and &s;ometimes meet with a good &s;ale from the Moori&s;h merchants, who come from the town to purcha&s;e cattle and grain.</P>
<P>Were the emperor to allow a free exportation of corn, with moderate duties, and to permit the people to enjoy what they earn, exacting only the tax allowed him by the Koran, of a tenth on each article, his &s;ubjects would &s;oon become very rich, and his own revenue would be trebly increa&s;ed. The &s;oil is &s;o fertile, that every grain is computed to produce an hundred fold; but, owing to the want of a greater demand for this article, the Arabs &s;ow little more than is nece&s;&s;ary for their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>The only guards of the&s;e rude habitations, both again&s;t thieves and wild bea&s;ts, are dogs of a very large and fierce &s;pecies. If the&s;e animals perceive a &s;tranger approach the camp, they furiou&s;ly i&s;&s;ue in a body again&s;t him, and probably would tear him to
<PB N="32" REF="027216_0040_0FD3E0018ABF7700">
pieces, were they not re&s;trained, and called off by their owners. Through the whole of the night they keep up an ince&s;&s;ant and melancholy barking and howling, which, though doubtle&s;s very u&s;e|ful, in keeping their ma&s;ters upon the watch, and frightening away wild bea&s;ts, yet, when united to the lowing of the herds and neighing of the hor&s;es which occupy the vacant &s;paces of the camp, cer|tainly tends to depre&s;s the &s;pirits, and impede that re&s;t which the fatigue attending tho&s;e journeys naturally requires.</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, between five and &s;ix in the morning, we quitted the habitations of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e ho&s;pitable Arabs, and travelled on to Mamora, where we arrived about &s;ix the &s;ame evening. The greater part of this day's journey afforded us a continuation of nearly the &s;ame appearances with that of the preceding day.</P>
<P>As we approached the town, we ob&s;erved on each &s;ide of the lakes &s;everal &s;anctuaries of Moor|i&s;h &s;aints. The&s;e &s;anctuaries are &s;tone buildings of about ten yards &s;quare, whitened over, with a cupola at the top, containing in them the body of the &s;aint.</P>
<P>A veneration for per&s;ons of eminent &s;anctity has pervaded all nations and all religions of the world. The Mahometan religion appears as little favour|able to this &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition as mo&s;t with which we are acquainted, as it &s;o tenaciou&s;ly in|&s;i&s;ts on the unity of God, and &s;o &s;trictly inhibits all creatures whatever from participating in the honours which are due only to the Deity. Some degree of idolatry, however, will prevail in every rude nation. When, therefore, a Mahometan
<PB N="33" REF="027216_0041_0FD3E004FB5B57D0">
&s;aint dies, he is buried with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, and a chapel is erected over his grave, which place afterwards becomes more &s;acred than even the mo&s;ques them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If the mo&s;t atrocious criminal takes refuge in one of the&s;e chapels, or &s;anctuaries, his per&s;on is &s;ecure. The emperor him&s;elf, who rarely &s;cruples to employ any means whatever that may &s;erve to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, &s;eldom violates the privi|lege of the&s;e places. When a Moor is oppre&s;&s;ed by any mental or bodily affliction, he applies to the neare&s;t &s;anctuary, and afterwards returns home with his mind calm and comforted, expecting to derive &s;ome con&s;iderable benefit from the prayers which he has offered there: and in all de&s;perate ca&s;es the &s;anctuary is the la&s;t re&s;ort.</P>
<P>Saints in Barbary are of two kinds. The fir&s;t are tho&s;e who by frequent ablutions, prayers, and other acts of devotion, have acquired an extraor|dinary reputation for piety. Too many of the&s;e are artful hypocrites, who under the ma&s;k of religion practi&s;e the mo&s;t flagrant immoralities. There are, however, in&s;tances of &s;ome among them, who&s;e practices accord in general with their profe&s;&s;ion, and who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to attend upon the &s;ick, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the nece&s;&s;itous and un|happy. From &s;uch as the&s;e the &s;evere &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy it&s;elf will &s;carcely withhold re&s;pect and veneration.</P>
<P>Idiots and madmen form the &s;econd cla&s;s of &s;aints. In every &s;tate of &s;ociety, indeed, an opi|nion has been prevalent, that per&s;ons afflicted with the&s;e mental complaints were under the in|fluence of &s;uperior powers. The oracles and pro|phets
<PB N="34" REF="027216_0042_0FD3E0060BB39B00">
of the heathen world derived their celebrity from this circum&s;tance; and even among the lower cla&s;&s;es in our own country we frequently have to encounter a &s;imilar prejudice. In conformity, therefore, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e notions, &s;o natural to uncu|ltivated man, the Moors con&s;ider the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons as being under the &s;pecial protection of Heaven, and divinely in&s;pired. Super&s;tition here, as perhaps in &s;ome other in&s;tances, becomes ad|mirably &s;ub&s;ervient to humanity and charity. In con&s;equence of this prejudice, the mo&s;t friendle&s;s and unprotected race of mortals find friends and protectors in the populace them&s;elves. They are fed and cloathed gratis wherever they wander, and are &s;ometimes loaded with pre&s;ents. A Moor might with as much &s;afety offer an in&s;ult to the emperor him&s;elf, as attempt by any &s;everity to re&s;train even the irregularities of the&s;e reputed prophets.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not, however, be di&s;&s;embled, that opi|nions which have not their ba&s;is in rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy are &s;eldom found to operate uniformly for the advantage of &s;ociety. Independent of the wide &s;cope which the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious notions afford to hypocri&s;y, numberle&s;s are the evils with which they are attended, &s;ince whatever mi&s;chief the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed mini&s;ters of heaven may perpetrate, their per&s;ons are always &s;acred. It is not long &s;ince there was a &s;aint at Morocco, who&s;e con&s;tant amu&s;e|ment was to wound and kill whatever per&s;ons un|fortunately fell his in way; yet, in &s;pite of the many fatal con&s;equences from his in&s;anity, he was &s;till &s;uffered to go at large.

While I re&s;ided at Morocco, I &s;en&s;ibly ex|perienced the inconvenience of coming within the vicinity of the&s;e &s;aints, as they &s;eemed to take a particular plea&s;ure in in&s;ulting and annoying Chri&s;|tians.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, I may mention under the head of &s;aints or prophets, the Marabouts, a cla&s;s of im|po&s;tors who pretend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kill in magic, and are highly e&s;teemed by the natives. They lead an in|dolent life, are the venders of &s;pells and charms, and live by the credulity of the populace.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o among the&s;e people a &s;et of itiner|ant mountaineers, who pretend to be the favourites of the prophet Mahomet, and that no kind of ve|nomous creatures can hurt them. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular of this cla&s;s are the Sidi Na&s;ir, or &s;nake-eaters, who exhibit in public upon market-days, and entertain the crowd by eating live &s;nakes, and per|forming juggling deceptions. I was once pre&s;ent at this &s;trange &s;pecies of amu&s;ement, and &s;aw a man, in the cour&s;e of two hours, eat a living &s;er|pent of four feet in length. He danced to the &s;ound of wild mu&s;ic, vocal and in&s;trumental, with a variety of odd ge&s;tures and contortions, &s;everal times round the circle formed by the &s;pectators. He then began his attack upon the tail, after he had recited a &s;hort prayer, in which he was joined by the multitude. This ceremony was repeated at intervals, till he had entirely devoured the &s;nake.</P>

Early in the even|ing of the fifth, we arrived at Mamora, which is di&s;tant about &s;ixty-four miles from Larache. It is &s;ituated upon a hill near the mouth of the river Saboe, the waters of which, gradually widening in their cour&s;e, fall into the Atlantic at this place, and form a harbour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Mamora, like the generality of the Moori&s;h towns through which I pa&s;&s;ed, contains little worthy of ob&s;ervation. While it was in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Portugueze it was encompa&s;&s;ed by a double wall, which &s;till remains; it had al&s;o other fortifications which are de&s;troyed.

<P>The fertile pa&s;tures, the exten&s;ive waters and plantations, which we pa&s;&s;ed on our way hither, have already been remarked. The vicinity of Mamora is equally enchanting.

<P>In the morning, between eight and nine, we mounted our mules, leaving Mamora, and direct|ing our cour&s;e towards Sallee; where we arrived between one and two at noon, after having tra|velled over a &s;pace of about fifteen miles.

Its walls, which are remarkably thick and high, extend in length for about half a mile, and have three &s;tupendous arch-ways opening to the road, through one of which we pa&s;&s;ed on our way to Sallee.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE name of Sallee is famous in hi&s;tory, and has decorated many a well-told tale. Tho&s;e piratical ve&s;&s;els which were fitted out from this port, and which were known by the name of Sal|lee-rovers; were long the terror of the mercantile world. Equally dreaded for their valour and their cruelty, the adventurers who navigated the&s;e &s;wift and formidable ve&s;&s;els, depopulated the ocean, and even dared &s;ometimes to extend their deva&s;ta|tions to the Chri&s;tian coa&s;ts. As plunder was their &s;ole aim, in the acqui&s;ition of it nothing im|peded their career. Human life was of no value in their e&s;timation, or if it was &s;ometimes &s;pared, it was not through any &s;entiment of ju&s;tice or compa&s;|&s;ion, but only that it might be protracted in the mo&s;t wretched of &s;ituations, as the hopele&s;s &s;lave to the luxury and caprice of a fellow mortal. The town of Sallee in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, though large, pre|&s;ents nothing worthy the ob&s;ervation of the tra|veller, except a battery of twenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the &s;ea, and a redoubt at the en|trance

of the river, which is about a quarter of a mile broad, and penetrates &s;everal miles into the interior country.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to Sallee is &s;ituated the town of Rabat, which formerly partook equally with Sallee in its piratical depredations, and was generally confounded with it. While Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Rabat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were thus formidable, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> might be termed independent &s;tates, pay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a very &s;mall tribute to the emperor, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acknowledging him for their &s;overeign. This &s;tate of independence undoubtedly gave uncom|mon vigour to their piratical exertions. Few will take much pains, or encounter great ri&s;ks for the acqui&s;ition of wealth, without the certainty of enjoying it unmole&s;ted.

This is not to in&s;truct, for I know I &s;peak to one of a more clear and quick &s;ight than my&s;elf; but I &s;peak this, becau&s;e God hath plea&s;ed to grant me a happy victory over &s;ome part of tho&s;e rebellious pirates, that &s;o long have mole&s;ted the peaceable trade of Europe; and hath pre|&s;ented further occa&s;ion to root out the generation of tho&s;e, who have been &s;o pernicious to the good of our nations: I mean, &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed God to be &s;o au&s;picious in our beginnings, in the conque&s;t of Sallee, that we might join and proceed in hope of like &s;ucce&s;s in the war of Tunis, Al|giers, and other places; dens and receptacles for the in|human villanies of tho&s;e who abhor rule and government. Herein while we interupt the corruption of malignant &s;pirits of the world, we &s;hall glorify the great God, and perform a duty that will &s;hine as glorious as the &s;un and moon, which all the earth may &s;ee and reverence: a work that &s;hall a&s;cend as &s;weet as the perfume of the mo&s;t precious odours, in the no&s;trils of the Lord: a work who&s;e memory &s;hall be reverenced &s;o long as there &s;hall be any remaining among men: a work grateful and happy to men who love and honour the piety and virtue of noble minds. This action I here willingly pre&s;ent to you, who&s;e piety and vir|tues equal the greatne&s;s of your power; that we, who are vicegerents to the great and mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the glory which the action pre&s;ents unto us.&mdash;Now, becau&s;e the i&s;lands which you govern, have been ever famous for the unconquered &s;trength of their &s;hipping, I have &s;ent this my tru&s;ty &s;ervant and amba&s;&s;ador, to know whether, in your princely wi&s;dom, you &s;hall think fit to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with &s;uch forces by &s;ea, as &s;hall be an&s;werable to tho&s;e I provide by land; which if you plea&s;e to grant, I doubt not but the Lord of Ho&s;ts will protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e that fight in &s;o glorious a cau&s;e.

a mortal blow to their piracies; for when tho&s;e de&s;perate mariners felt the uncertainty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any length of time their captures, they no longer be|came &s;olicitous to acquire them; and at length, when the man who had deprived them of their privileges became emperor, he put a total &s;top to their depredations, by declaring him&s;elf at peace with all Europe. Since that period the entrance of the river has been &s;o gradually filling up with &s;and wa&s;hed in by the &s;ea, that was it po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e people to recover their independence, it would incapacitate them for carrying on their piracies to their former extent.</P>

from an intention of revenging the cau&s;e of the Jew, for I could not find out which of the di&s;pu|tants was in the wrong; but as my attendants had on two or three former occa&s;ions &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to be trouble&s;ome, and as &s;o glaring an indignity was offered to the per&s;on who looked up to me for protection, I was determined to avail my&s;elf of this opportunity of convincing them that it was their duty to pay me every attention.</P>
<P>Mr. De Rocher, who re&s;ides in an excellent hou&s;e built at the expence of his court, and who is the only European in the place, has happily blended original Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality with that ea&s;y politene&s;s which characterizes his own nation. He gave me &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an invitation to &s;pend an|other day with him, that though anxious to make an end of my journey, I could not re&s;i&s;t his urg|ent &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>The town of Rabat, who&s;e walls enclo&s;e a large &s;pace of ground, is defended on the &s;ea-&s;ide by three forts tolerably well fini&s;hed, which were erected &s;ome little time ago by an Engli&s;h rene|gado, and furni&s;hed with guns from Gibraltar. The hou&s;es in general are good, and many of the inhabitants are wealthy. The Jews, who are very numerous in this place, are generally in better circum&s;tances than tho&s;e of Larache or Tangier, and their women are by far more beautiful than at any other town which I &s;aw in this empire. I was introduced to one family in particular, where, out of eight &s;i&s;ters, nature had been &s;o lavi&s;h to them all, that I felt my&s;elf at a lo&s;s to determine which was the hand&s;ome&s;t. A combination of regular features, clearne&s;s of complexion, and expre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="44" REF="027216_0052_0FD3E01E28DC53C0">
black eyes, gave them a di&s;tingui&s;hed pre-eminence over their nation in general; and their per&s;ons, though not improved by the advantages which the European ladies derive from dre&s;s, were &s;till replete with grace and elegance.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle, which is very exten&s;ive, contains a &s;trong building, formerly u&s;ed by the late empe|ror as his principal trea&s;ury, and a noble terrace, which commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the town of Sallee, the ocean, and all the neighbour|ing country. There are al&s;o the ruins of another ca&s;tle, which is &s;aid to have been built by Jacob Almonzor, one of their former emperors, and of which at pre&s;ent very little remains but its walls, containing within them &s;ome very &s;trong maga|zines for powder and naval &s;tores. On the out|&s;ide of the&s;e walls is a very high and &s;quare tower, hand&s;omely built <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut &s;tone, and called the tower of Ha&s;&s;en. From the workman&s;hip of this tower, contra&s;ted with the other buildings, a very accu|rate idea may be formed how greatly the Moors have degenerated from their former &s;plendour and ta&s;te for architecture.</P>
<P>In the evening the con&s;ul introduced me to Sidi Mahomet Effendi, the emperor's prime mini&s;ter, who was at Rabat, on his way to Tangier. I found him a well-bred man, and he received me very graciou&s;ly. After &s;ome conver&s;ation on the purpo&s;e of my journey, he de&s;ired I would feel his pul&s;e, and acquaint him whether or not he was in health. Upon a&s;&s;uring him that he was perfectly well, he expre&s;&s;ed in &s;trong terms the obligation I had conferred on him by &s;uch agree|able information; and having wi&s;hed me &s;ucce&s;s

<P>I availed my&s;elf of my delay at Rabat to get the lame mule changed, and directed my Negro &s;oldiers to arrange our affairs in &s;uch a manner that we might leave the place early the next morn|ing. Mr De Rocher, in addition to the kindne&s;s I had already experienced, ordered a quantity of bread, which at this place is remarkably good, to be packed up for my u&s;e, as well as a proportion|able &s;hare of cold meat, and as much wine as we could conveniently carry with us. This &s;ea&s;on|able &s;upply la&s;ted me three days, and gave me time to recover in &s;ome degree my former reli&s;h for fowls and eggs.</P>
<P>Though I mu&s;t acknowledge that the attention and comforts which I experienced during my &s;hort &s;tay at Rabat proved a great relief, after the in|conveniences I had undergone in travelling thither, yet on the whole, I perhaps &s;uffered more from the idea of having &s;imilar inconveniences to tho&s;e I had already experienced &s;till to encounter, with|out a pro&s;pect of a &s;imilar alleviation, than if I had continued the whole journey in an uninter|rupted &s;tate.

Never has the convenience of our highways &s;truck me &s;o much, as when I have been obliged to travel through thick woods and deep mar&s;hes. How much would a peregrination of eight days, in the manner I have travelled for &s;ome time pa&s;t, change the ideas of tho&s;e delicate Europeans who are continually complaining of bad inns, and of the fatigues they endure in their journeys!

<P>Again, in another letter, "How often mu&s;t you depart in the morning, without knowing where you will arrive in the evening! How often lo&s;ing your&s;elf in the&s;e de&s;erts, mu&s;t you &s;earch out your way amid&s;t thorny brakes, thick fore&s;ts, and &s;teep rocks; &s;ometimes &s;topped by a river which you mu&s;t wade through, by a lake which you mu&s;t walk round, or by a mar&s;h which you cannot cro&s;s without danger! &s;ometimes &s;corched by the &s;un, or drenched by the rain, and at others dying with thir&s;t, without being able to find the &s;malle&s;t &s;pring to quench it!

The&s;e fruits grow common in the open ground, and we only paid two blanquils, or three-pence Engli&s;h a-piece, for wa|ter-melons, which were &s;ufficiently large to &s;erve
<PB N="48" REF="027216_0056_0FD3E0241C1BB1A8">
half a dozen people. I could not help ob&s;erving how provident nature has been, in granting in &s;uch plenty, fruits &s;o well calculated for the na|tives of warm climates. Indeed, many of the poor in this country have &s;carcely any other pro|vi&s;ions than fruit and bread.</P>
<P>At the time of our departure the appearance in the atmo&s;phere promi&s;ed us a continuance of the &s;ame fine weather we had hitherto experienced; and it continued &s;o till we had pa&s;&s;ed three &s;mall &s;treams which the Moors name the Hitcumb, Sher|rat, and Bornica. The&s;e, after the heavy rains have fallen, &s;well out into deep and rapid rivers, and are frequently rendered totally impa&s;&s;able, ex|cept in boats or on rafts. About five in the eve|ning, however, very heavy and black clouds be|gan to a&s;&s;emble, and very &s;hortly after followed a mo&s;t &s;evere &s;torm. It was a dreadful union of wind, hail, rain, thunder, and lightning. From darkne&s;s approaching fa&s;t upon us, we be|came very anxious to find out a place of &s;afety where we might pitch our tent, and for that pur|po&s;e &s;purred our bea&s;ts; but no excitement from the &s;pur or whip could induce them to face the &s;torm, and we were obliged to wait a full hour in a &s;tate of inactivity, till its violence was over. We then pu&s;hed on till we arrived at a couple of Arab tents, pitched in an open country: bad as this &s;ituation was, we however rejoiced in be|ing able to fix our tent for the night, even in this un&s;ociable &s;pot.</P>
<P>On the 9th of October, it having rained the whole night, we were detained till between ten and eleven in the morning in drying the tent,
<PB N="49" REF="027216_0057_0FD3E027204B41F8">
which from its being quite wet, was become too heavy for the mules to carry with the other bag|gage; we then pur&s;ued our journey, and at twelve, arrived at the ruins of Men&s;ooria. There was formerly a ca&s;tle on this &s;pot, which from the ex|tent of its walls, and a &s;quare tower which form the whole of the ruins, appears to have been a very large building. My &s;oldiers informed me, that it had been the re&s;idence of a prince who was in oppo&s;ition to his &s;overeign; and who was obli|ged to de&s;ert it. The building was de&s;troyed by the then reigning emperor, and the intermediate ground is now inhabited by a few Negroes, living in &s;mall huts, who were bani&s;hed thither for having on &s;ome occa&s;ion incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the emperor. In an arbitrary country, where the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne depends more on the will of the &s;oldiers than on the rights of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, the de&s;pot con&s;iders that ca&s;tles may prove rather places of &s;ecurity for his opponents, than of any great utility to him&s;elf; he therefore either &s;uffers them to decay, or de&s;troys them entirely, according to the dictates of his caprice. Indeed every town through which I pa&s;&s;ed in the empire affords &s;triking marks of the truth of this a&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>Soon after our leaving Men&s;ooria we came up to Fadala, having forded in our way the river In|fe&s;ic. Fadala whil&s;t its ruins exi&s;t, will be a la&s;t|ing monument of Sidi Mahomet's caprice. It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;hell of a town, began by him in the early part of his reign, but never fini&s;hed. It is enclo&s;ed within a &s;quare wall, and is furni&s;hed with a mo&s;que (the only building that was com|pleated)
<PB N="50" REF="027216_0058_0FD3E027B27217D0">
for the u&s;e of the inhabitants, who, like tho&s;e of Men&s;ooria, live in huts in the intermedi|ate ground. To the right of Fadala we ob&s;erved a &s;mall but apparently neat palace, which my at|tendants informed me was built by the late em|peror for his occa&s;ional u&s;e, when bu&s;ine&s;s led him to travel that way.</P>
<P>The remainder of our journey to Dar Beyda, where we arrived about &s;ix in the evening, af|forded nothing remarkable, excepting that we pa&s;&s;ed over a double bridge, which is the only piece of architecture of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind that I &s;aw in the country. It is the work of Sidi Mahomet, and is built of &s;tone. The country between Rabat and Dar Beyda, a di&s;tance of about forty-four miles, is one continuation of barrenne&s;s and rock.</P>
<P>Dar Beyda is a &s;mall &s;ea-port of very little im|portance; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, however, a bay which ad|mits ve&s;&s;els of pretty con&s;iderable burthen to anchor in it with tolerable &s;afety, except when the wind blows hard at north-we&s;t, and then they are liable to be driven on &s;hore. Upon my arri|val, I was immediately introduced to the gover|nor, who was then in the audience-chamber, at|tending to the complaints of the inhabitants. Af|ter offering me his &s;ervices, and begging my acceptance of a few fowls, he &s;oon left us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the room where we &s;lept that night.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October we departed for Aza|more, about fifty-&s;ix miles di&s;tant, between &s;even and eight in the morning; and after a journey of two days came up to the Morbeya, at the mouth and &s;outhern &s;ide of which is &s;ituated Azamore.
<PB N="51" REF="027216_0059_0FD3E02DF0FFFDB8">
The river is &s;o wide and deep here, that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be ferried over, and a large boat is con|tinually employed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner got all our baggage, our mules, and our&s;elves into the boat, and were ready to row off, than a mo&s;t violent di&s;pute aro&s;e between my Negro &s;oldiers and the ferry|men. As it was no new circum&s;tance to me to be a witne&s;s to the&s;e altercations, I remained very quietly in the boat till I ob&s;erved that one of the ferry-men was putting every thing on &s;hore again, whil&s;t another was collaring one of the &s;oldiers. In fact, matters were proceeding to &s;uch extre|mities, that I thought it was full time to interfere.</P>
<P>Upon inquiry, I was informed that the propri|etor of the ferry farmed the river from the empe|ror, and that in con&s;equence of it he was allowed all the perqui&s;ites of the ferry; that my &s;oldiers in&s;i&s;ted that as I was in the emperor's &s;ervice, it was the duty of the people to ferry me, my bag|gage, &amp;c. without receiving any reward for their trouble. Which of the two were in the right I could not pretend to determine; but I was very glad to end the di&s;pute, by paying the u&s;ual de|mand. After a few cur&s;es on both &s;ides, the bag|gage and mules were replaced in the boat, and we were ferried over to Azamore.</P>
<P>In a country where arts and &s;ciences are totally neglected, and where the hand of de&s;poti&s;m has de&s;troyed public &s;pirit, and depre&s;&s;ed all private exertion, it is obvious, that con&s;iderable tracts mu&s;t occur which are productive of nothing de|&s;erving of notice. This was preci&s;ely the ca&s;e in my journey from Dar Beyda to Azamore, which
<PB N="52" REF="027216_0060_0FD3E031A3F6C980">
pre&s;ented to our view one continued chain of rocks and barrenne&s;s, unplea&s;ant and fatiguing roads, without any one object to vary the &s;cene, or to intere&s;t curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Azamore is a &s;ea-port town on the Atlantic ocean, &s;ituated at the mouth of the Morbeya; and though a large place, is neither ornamented with public buildings, nor has any thing remark|able in its hi&s;tory or &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In compliance with the particular reque&s;t of one of my &s;oldiers who&s;e near relations re&s;ide at Aza|more, I continued here the remainder of the day, and was lodged in a room of a Moori&s;h hou&s;e, which was &s;ecluded from the family. Soon after my arrival I was vi&s;ited by a Jew in an European dre&s;s, who had formerly lived with one of the Engli&s;h con&s;uls, and who &s;poke the Engli&s;h lan|guage with tolerable fluency. He took me to his hou&s;e, and there received me with great ho&s;pi|tality, in&s;i&s;ting on my dining with him, and mak|ing u&s;e of his hou&s;e as my own. After dinner he &s;hewed me the different parts of the town; and in the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation reque&s;ted me to be particularly cautious how I conducted my&s;elf with the prince whom I was going to attend; ob&s;erving, that the Moors were extremely fickle, and their conduct governed merely by the caprice of the moment. To enforce this caution, he related to me a &s;tory, from which I learned that an Euro|pean &s;urgeon had at &s;ome former period, attended a prince of Morocco, who, neglecting his advice when under his care, had increa&s;ed his malady; that this circum&s;tance &s;o alarmed the prince that he &s;ent for the &s;urgeon, and upon his appearance
<PB N="53" REF="027216_0061_0FD3E032A0BFCDE8">
produced a pi&s;tol. The unfortunate man, alarmed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch unworthy treatment, ha&s;tily withdraw, and in a &s;hort time put an end to his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>On the 13th of October, having taken leave of my Jewi&s;h acquaintance, and my &s;oldiers of their friends, we &s;et off at eight in the morning for the town of Saffi, where we arrived on the evening of the 15th, after a journey of about fifty-&s;even miles. The country we pa&s;&s;ed through was rocky and barren, producing &s;carcely a tree, or indeed any verdure whatever.</P>
<P>Soon after leaving Azamore, the town of Maza|gan pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view to our right. This place was taken a few years &s;ince by Sidi Mahomet from the Portugueze; a conque&s;t of which his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty made a very pompous boa&s;t, though it is well known that the Portu|gueze, from the great inconvenience and expence of keeping up the garri&s;on, without deriving any material advantage from it, had come to a re&s;o|lution to evacuate it before the emperor's attack, and for that purpo&s;e had actually begun to em|bark their goods and property. As, however, the emperor was determined to exhibit &s;ome &s;pe|cimen of his military prowe&s;s and addre&s;s, this circum&s;tance did not deter him from commencing a regular &s;iege. A magazine for military &s;tores (which may be &s;een from the road) was rai&s;ed with the utmo&s;t expedition, and the attack was carried on with all the vigour and ability which his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty was capable of exerting. The Portugueze defended the town no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary to allow time to carry away
<PB N="54" REF="027216_0062_0FD3E033D2D5D2B8">
their effects and valuables; it was then &s;ur|rendered, or more properly, abandoned, to the Moors.</P>
<P>On the day of our arrival at Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> we pa&s;&s;ed by the ruins of a town, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> large and con&s;iderable. It was built by a former emperor, named Muley Ocom Mon&s;or, and is now called by the name of Dyn Medina Rabaea. Its only remains at pre&s;ent are remarkably thick and ex|ten&s;ive walls, which inclo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rdens and huts, inhabited by di&s;banded Negro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oldiers.</P>
<P>Saffi is a &s;ea-port town, &s;ituated at the bottom of a &s;teep and high mountain. It is a &s;mall place, and is only remarkable for a neat palace, which is the occa&s;ional re&s;idence of the emperor's &s;ons, and a &s;mall fort at a little di&s;tance to the north of the town. Its vicinity is a mixture of moun|tains and woods, which gives it a wild and truly romantic appearance. Saffi carried on a con&s;ider|able commerce with Europe, before Sidi Mahomet obliged the European merchants to re&s;ide at Mogodore. It affords a &s;afe road for &s;hipping, except when the wind blows hard at We&s;t, and then they are &s;ubject to be driven on &s;hore.</P>
<P>During my re&s;idence in this town, I took up my quarters at a Jewi&s;h hou&s;e, and was vi&s;ited by two Moors who had been in London, and could &s;peak a little of the Engli&s;h language. Among other marks of attention, they contrived to procure, unknown to me, a chair and a &s;mall table; articles which I had not &s;een &s;ince I left Tangier, except at the French con&s;ul's hou&s;e, as the Moors never make u&s;e of either.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="027216_0063_0FD3E035E9E8B2E0">At eight in the morning of the &s;ixteenth, we &s;et off for Mogodore, a journey of about &s;ixty miles, which we performed in two days.</P>
<P>Soon after leaving Saffi we pa&s;&s;ed over a very high and dangerous mountain. The rocky, &s;teep, and rugged path, which was only broad enough to allow one mule to pa&s;s at a time, and the per|pendicular precipice which hung over the &s;ea, filled our minds with a &s;en&s;e of terror and awe, which no pen can de&s;cribe. Our mules, however, accu&s;|tomed to this mode of travelling, carried us with the mo&s;t perfect &s;afety, over parts where, with European hor&s;es, we &s;hould probably have been da&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>From this mountain we in a &s;hort time entered a fore&s;t of dwarf oaks, which is about &s;ix miles in length, and the &s;outhern extremity of which reaches to the river Tan&s;if. This is a very broad river, which after the heavy rains have fallen, or when &s;welled by the tide, is always pa&s;&s;ed upon rafts. Tho&s;e difficulties not pre&s;enting them&s;elves to us now, we forded the river with great ea&s;e, and on approaching its &s;outhern &s;ide, ob&s;erved in the mid&s;t of a thick fore&s;t a large &s;quare ca&s;tle, which my &s;oldies informed me was built by Muley I&s;hmael, who is immortalized by the pen of Mr. Addi&s;on, in one of the numbers of the Free|holder. Sidi Mahomet neglected it, and it is now falling to ruin. The breadth and windings of the Tan&s;if, its high and woody banks, and the ca&s;tle ju&s;t di&s;coverable through the trees, afforded al|together a &s;cene, which though &s;omewhat gloomy, yet was truly romantic and picture&s;que.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="027216_0064_0FD3E036D7BBC288">The directions which I had received from Mr. Matra were, to continue at Mogodore, till the return of a me&s;&s;enger, who was to be di&s;patched thence to Tarudant, informing the prince of my arrival.</P>
<P>The very ho&s;pitable treatment I experienced from Mr. Hutchi&s;on, Briti&s;h vice-con&s;ul at Mogo|dore, during my &s;tay at his hou&s;e, with the &s;ym|pathi&s;ing letters and friendly advice with which he afterwards favoured me, whil&s;t under the many embarra&s;&s;ments and inconveniencies which I under|went at Morocco, have made the mo&s;t forcible impre&s;&s;ion on my memory; and I &s;hould feel utter|ly di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf if I omitted thus public|ly to acknowledge my gratitude to that gentleman.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to de&s;cribe Mogodore it may not be improper to take a &s;hort review of the gene|ral appearance of the country through which I pa&s;&s;ed in my journey from Tangier.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the journey, as far as Larache, pre&s;ented to us, as I before ob&s;erved, a rocky, mountainous, and barren country, and, if we ex|cept the fore&s;t of Rabe a Clow, but few trees or &s;hrubs. From Larache to Sallee the eye was a|greeably relieved by the variety of objects which offered them&s;elves to its view. The evenne&s;s of the ground, the numerous lakes, and the verdure which &s;urrounded them, indicated fully the ferti|lity of the &s;oil; and the&s;e, joined to the inter&s;ected clumps of trees, would lead the contemplative mind to conceive that nature had intended this &s;pot for the re&s;idence of a more civilized people than its pre&s;ent inhabitants. From Sallee to Mo|godore, and thence to Santa Cruz, we again meet
<PB N="57" REF="027216_0065_0FD3E0384C3A2080">
with the &s;ame barren, mountainous, and rocky country, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf at the fir&s;t part of the journey.</P>
<P>Though I occa&s;ionally met with fore&s;ts of &s;mall treeks, &s;uch as the arga, the dwarf oak, the palm|tree, &amp;c. yet the country produces no u&s;eful tim|ber whatever. The Moors are therefore obliged to import that article from Europe; and it may be on this account that the emperor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o few ve&s;&s;els, and is obliged to &s;end tho&s;e to be repaired in foreign ports. As vegetation does not take place in this climate till &s;ome time after the heavy rains have fallen, I had not an oportunity of ob&s;erving in this journey what plants were peculiar to the cli|mate. The variety which di&s;tingui&s;hes the more im|proved countries of Europe, and particularlar Eng|land, probably ari&s;es as much from the land being di&s;tributed into inclo&s;ures, as from local &s;ituation. This advantage the emperor of Morocco does not enjoy; &s;ince, excepting in the immediate vicinity of towns, no divi&s;ions of land are to be ob&s;erved; the Arabs indi&s;criminately chu&s;ing pieces of ground, without fences, for the purpo&s;es of agri|culture, which, as I before noticed, they change as occa&s;ion requires. The &s;amene&s;s of &s;cene which ari&s;es from this circum&s;tance, is in &s;ome degree le&s;&s;ened by the numerous &s;anctuaries which are diffu&s;ed over the whole country; but otherways the&s;e chapels prove trouble&s;ome to an European traveller, &s;ince the Moors, upon pa&s;&s;ing them, always &s;top a con&s;iderable time to pay their devo|tions to the remains of the &s;aints who are buried there. There is likewi&s;e a cu&s;tom in this country, which is al&s;o prevalent in Portugal, of con&s;ecrating
<PB N="58" REF="027216_0066_0FD3E03A363EEEB0">
the &s;pot on which any per&s;on has been murdered, by heaping a large proportion of &s;tones on the place, where it is u&s;ual for tho&s;e who pa&s;s that way to add another &s;tone to the number, and to recite a &s;hort prayer, adapted to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the towns through which I pa&s;&s;ed in my way hither, were &s;urrounded with high walls of Tabby, flanked with &s;quare forts, generally with|out any artillery, and having ca&s;tles, which &s;eemed to be in a very ruinous &s;tate, &s;ituated upon the mo&s;t eminent &s;pot, for their defence or attack. The hou&s;es, from having no windows and but very few doors, had more the appearance of dead walls than inhabited places; and their &s;treets were univer&s;ally narrow, filthy to a degree, irregular, and badly paved. With all the&s;e inconveniencies, the inhabitatants enjoy an advantage of which many of the more civilized capitals of Europe can|not boa&s;t, I mean that of good police. The &s;treets are &s;o well watched at night, that robberies or even hou&s;ebreaking are but &s;eldom heard of; and the general quietne&s;s which reigns through their towns after the gates are &s;hut, is a convincing proof of the attention of their patroles to their duty. Their detection, and &s;peedy bringing to ju&s;tice the criminals, likewi&s;e de&s;erves our attention. From having no publick hou&s;es or other places to har|bour thieves, and from no per&s;on being permitted to quit the country without leave, it is utterly im|po&s;&s;ible for a culprit to e&s;cape the hand of ju&s;tice, except by taking refuge in a &s;anctuary, by which he bani&s;hes him&s;elf for ever from &s;ociety. On the other hand, the vigilance of the governors and other officers of ju&s;tice is &s;o great, and conducted
<PB N="59" REF="027216_0067_0FD3E03B4C1798A8">
with &s;o much addre&s;s, that unle&s;s the means of &s;afety which his religion points out are quickly adopted, the criminal in a very &s;hort time is de|tected, and as quickly puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>According to the opinion of &s;ome travellers, much danger is to be apprehended in traver&s;ing this country, from the attacks of wild bea&s;ts; but it is only ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that during the whole of my progre&s;s to Mogodore, and indeed I may add afterwards in pa&s;&s;ing over the Atlas, I met with no ob&s;truction or mole&s;tation whatever from the&s;e animals; and I was al&s;o informed, that a cir|cum&s;tance of the kind was very rarely known to have happened. The fact is, the wild animals confine them&s;elves principally to the interior parts of the country, and to tho&s;e retreats in the moun|tains which are beyond the track of men.</P>
<P>Mogodore, &s;o named by Europeans, and Suera by the Moors, is a large, uniform, and well-built town, &s;ituated about three hundred and fifty miles from Tangier, on the Atlantic ocean, and &s;ur|rounded on the land &s;ide by deep and heavy &s;ands. It was raised under the au&s;pices of Sidi Mahomet, who upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne ordered all the European merchants who were &s;ettled in his dominions to re&s;ide at Mogodore, where, by lower|ing the duties, he promi&s;ed to afford every en|couragement to commerce. The Europeans, thus obliged to de&s;ert their former e&s;tabli&s;hments, con|&s;idering this fir&s;t &s;tep of the emperor to be a mark of his attachment to trade and commerce, and having re&s;ided long in the country without any better views at home, univer&s;ally &s;ettled at Mogo|dore, where they erected hou&s;es, and other con|veniencies
<PB N="60" REF="027216_0068_0FD3E03F4D52D3E0">
for the purpo&s;es of trade. The hopes, however, with which they had changed their &s;itua|tion, were con&s;iderably fru&s;trated by the perfidy of the emperor, who indeed fulfilled his promi&s;e, till he ob&s;erved the merchants &s;o fixed as not to be likely to remove; but he then began to increa&s;e the duties, and by that means to damp the &s;pirit of commerce which he had promi&s;ed to promote. His caprice, however, or, what had &s;till more influence, valuable pre&s;ents, induced him at times to relax the&s;e &s;everities. In con&s;equence of this circum&s;tance the duties have been &s;o frequently varied, that it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;tate, with any degree of certainty, the u&s;ual burthens laid upon articles of commerce in this port.</P>
<P>The factory at Mogodore con&s;i&s;ts of about a dozen mercantile hou&s;es of different nations, who&s;e owners, from the protection granted them by the emperor, live in full &s;ecurity from the Moors, whom indeed they keep at a rigid di&s;tance. They export to America, mules. To Europe, Morocco leather, hides, gum arabic, gum &s;andarac, o&s;trich feathers, copper, wax, wool, elephants' teeth, fine mats, beautiful carpeting, dates, figs, rai&s;ms, olives, almonds, oil, &amp;c. In return they import timber, artillery of all kinds, gunpowder, woollen cloths, linens, lead, iron in bars, all kinds of hardware and trinkets, &s;uch as looking-gla&s;&s;es, &s;nuff-boxes, watches, &s;mall knives, &amp;c. tea, &s;ugar, &s;pices, and mo&s;t of the u&s;eful articles which are not otherwi&s;e to be procured in this empire.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the commerce carried on between this empire and Europe, the Moors have al&s;o a trade with Guinea, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Grand
<PB N="61" REF="027216_0069_0FD3E040F23D6B70">
Cairo, and Mecca, by means of their caravans, of which I &s;oon &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly.</P>
<P>Mogodore is regularly fortified on the &s;ea &s;ide; and on the land, batteries are &s;o placed as to pre|vent any incur&s;ions from the Southern Arabs, who are of a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, and who, from the great wealth which is known to be always in Mogodore, would gladly avail them|&s;elves of any opportunity that offered to pil|lage the town. The entrance, both by &s;ea and land, con&s;i&s;ts of elegant &s;tone arch-ways, with double gates. The market-place is hand&s;omely built, with piazzas of the &s;ame materials, and at the water port there is a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and pow|der magazine, both of which are neat &s;tone build|ings. Be&s;ide the&s;e public edifices, the emperor has a &s;mall but hand&s;ome palace for his occa&s;ional re&s;idence. The &s;treets of the town, though very narrow, are all in &s;trait lines, and the hou&s;es, contrary to what we meet with in the other towns of the empire, are lofty and regular. The bay, which is little better than a road, and is very much expo&s;ed when the wind is at North-We&s;t, is formed by a curve in the land, and a &s;mall i&s;land about a quarter of a mile from the &s;hore. Its en|trance is defended by a fort well mounted with guns.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I had a better opportunity of being inform|ed of the &s;tate of the country, and its pro|ductions, from the European merchants at Mogo|dore, than occurred at any &s;ub&s;equent period during my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, I &s;hall now avail my&s;elf of that information, and to this I feel my&s;elf induced by a further motive, namely, that it will enable the reader to peru&s;e with more &s;atisfaction and advan|tage the &s;ucceeding pages of this Narrative.</P>
<P>The empire of Morocco is &s;ituated between the 29th and 36th degree of North latitude. It is about five hundred and fifty miles in length from North to South, and about two hundred in breadth. It is bounded to the North by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Gibral|tar and the Mediterranean &s;ea; to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t, by the kingdoms of Tremecen and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&punc; to the South, by the river Suz, and the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ry to the South of Tafile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and to the We&s;t, by the Atlantic ocean. The empire is formed of &s;everal provinces and nominal kingdoms, which, as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> coun|tries, before their union were di&s;tinct and petty &s;overeignties.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="027216_0071_0FD3E044A7B21FE8">The climate, though in the Southern pro|vinces very hot in the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, yet is in general friendly to the con&s;titu|tions of its inhabitants, as well as to tho&s;e of Europeans. To the North the climate is nearly the &s;ame as that of Spain and Portugal, with the autumnal and vernal rains peculiar to to tho&s;e countries; but to the Southward, the rains are le&s;s general and certain, and of cour&s;e the heat is more exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the towns which Europeans are allowed to enter, being &s;ea-ports, have the advantage of being frequently refre&s;hed with &s;ea breezes; and Mogodore, though &s;o far to the Southward, from being &s;ubject in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on to have the wind regularly at North We&s;t, is quite as cool as the more temperate climates of Europe. Morocco and Tarudant are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nland, and therefore, though nearly in the &s;ame degree of Latitude as Mogodore, are much hotter; their great heats, however, are con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened by their vicinity to the Atlas, the higher parts of which are the whole year covered with &s;now, and often favour them with cool and refre&s;hing breezes.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of the empire of Morocco is naturally very fertile, and with proper cultivation and at|tention is capable of producing all the luxuries of the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern worlds. It mu&s;t, how|ever, be confe&s;&s;ed, that on &s;ome parts of the &s;ea|coast, particularly where it is mountainous, like every other country under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the &s;oil is &s;andy and barren; but wherever there is the lea&s;t appearance of a plain, &s;uch as that between Larache and Mamora, and in the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="64" REF="027216_0072_0FD3E045D655E540">
of Morocco and Tarudant, the &s;oil is black and rich. Indeed I am informed from the be&s;t authority, that at Ta&s;ilet, and throughout mo&s;t of the interior parts of the empire, its fer|tility is beyond imagination.</P>
<P>From the &s;light cultivation it at pre&s;ent receives, which is merely the burning of the &s;tabble before the autumnal rains come on, and ploughing it about &s;ix inches deep, the earth produces, at a very early &s;ea&s;on, excellent wheat and barley (though no oats) Indian corn, alderoy, beans, pea&s;e, hemp, and flax; oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, melons, water-melons, olives, figs, almonds, grapes, da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, and in fact all the fruits to be found in the South|ern provinces of Spain and Portugal. The people here pre&s;erve their grain in Matamores, holes made in the earth, lined and covered with &s;traw, on which earth is placed in a pyramidal form, to pre|vent the rain from &s;oaking in. In the&s;e &s;tores corn has been kept five or &s;ix years, without under|going any very material change.</P>
<P>As little encouragement, however, is extended to indu&s;try in this country, many of their fruits which require attention, particularly their grapes, apples, pears, plumbs, &amp;c. do not arrive at that perfection to which they are brought in Europe. Could, indeed, a proper &s;pirit for agriculture and foreign commerce be introduced in the country, or, in other words, could the &s;overeign be per|&s;uaded, that by &s;uffering his &s;ubjects to be enriched he would improve his own trea&s;ury, this empire, from its convenient &s;ituation with re&s;pect to Eu|rope, and from the natural luxuriance and fertility
<PB N="65" REF="027216_0073_0FD3E0482563C700">
of its &s;oil, might become of the highe&s;t political and commercial importance. The only material impediment to commerce is the inconvenience and in&s;ecurity of the ports. I am well informed, how|ever, that at Valedia there is a ba&s;on formed by nature, capable of containing with &s;afety any number of &s;hipping; and the other ports might mo&s;t probably be improved.</P>
<P>It is melancholy, in traver&s;ing the immen&s;e tract of &s;o fine a country, to ob&s;erve &s;o much land lying wa&s;te and uncultivated, which by a very little attention would be capable of producing an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure to its inhabitants. From this repre&s;entation it would &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed credible, that Spain, which is al&s;o a fine country, and a civilized nation &s;hould be obliged to remit to the emperor, very large pre&s;ents of money, to induce him to allow his &s;ubjects to export corn, as well as mo&s;t other kinds of provi&s;ions and fruits, from Tangier and Tetuan. Indeed the Southern provinces of Spain can hardly exi&s;t without this &s;upply. To what are we to attribute this circum&s;tance? Is it that Morocco is &s;o much more fertile than Spain, that it producees a re|dundance with &s;carcely any cultivation; or is the indolence of the Spaniards &s;uperior to that of the Moors them&s;elves?</P>
<P>The Jews in mo&s;t of the towns of the empire make wine; but, either owing to the grapes not being in &s;uch perfection as tho&s;e of Europe, or to an improper mode of preparing it, its flavour proves but very indifferent. They al&s;o di&s;til a &s;pecies; of brandy from figs and rai&s;ins, well known in that country by the name of aquadent.
<PB N="66" REF="027216_0074_0FD3E048A844D298">
This liquor has a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, but in point of &s;trength is little inferior to &s;pirits of wine. It is drank without dilution very freely by the Jews on all their fea&s;ts or days of rejoicing, and there are very few of the Moors who are di&s;po&s;ed to forego any private opportunity of taking their &s;hare of it al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Moors cultivate tobacco; there is a &s;pecies of it near Mequinez, which affords &s;nuff, the flavour of which is very little inferior to Maccaba. In my progre&s;s through the country I have no|ticed fore&s;ts of oak trees of a dwarf kind, which bear acorns of a remarkable &s;ize and &s;weet ta&s;te. To the Southward we meet with the palm or date tree, the arga, bearing a nut of the almond &s;pecies, with the olive, from both of which the inhabitants extract great quantities of oil, which con&s;titutes a con&s;iderable part of their exports to foreign countries. There is al&s;o an infinite variety of &s;hrubs and plants, &s;uch as the prickly pear, the aloe, &amp;c. all in &s;hort that are to be found in Spain and Portugal. Cotton, wax, honey, &s;alt, tran|&s;parent gum, and gum &s;andarac, are all pro|ductions of this empire.</P>
<P>In the mountains of Atlas there are numerous iron mines; but as the Moors do not under&s;tand the mode of working iron, tho&s;e mines prove of no u&s;e to them, and they are therefore obliged to procure that article from Europe. The neigh|bourhood of Tarudant produces mines of copper; and the Moors a&s;&s;ert, that in the Atlas there are al|&s;o &s;ome of gold and &s;ilver, which the emperor will not allow to be touched. But I am inclined to imagine that if the a&s;&s;ertion had any foundation in
<PB N="67" REF="027216_0075_0FD3E04CB117A468">
truth, the Brebes, who inhabit the&s;e mountains, and who are mere nominal &s;ubjects, and pay but little re&s;pect to the government of Morocco, would long before this time have di&s;covered them. It is, however, probable that this va&s;t chain of mountains may contain productions which might be converted to very valuable purpo&s;es; but, owing to a want of emulation on the part of the inhabitants, and Europeans not being al|lowed to attempt any new di&s;coveries, a know|ledge of them is not to be attained.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic animals of Morocco are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Europe, excepting the camel, which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful animal in this quarter of the globe, both on account of the great fatigue which it is capable of undergoing, and the little &s;ub&s;i&s;tance it requires. Camels are employed here for all the purpo&s;es of agriculture and commerce, and are very numerous. It has been a&s;&s;erted that dromedaries are indigenous to this country; but in the cour&s;e of my whole tour I could hear of none, except tho&s;e which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the emperor; and he, as I di&s;covered, procures them from the coa&s;t of Guinea. The&s;e are the fleete&s;t animals for travelling that are known, and are only u&s;ed by the emperor on urgent occa&s;ions. I was informed that their pace is &s;ometimes &s;o ex|ceedingly &s;wift, that their riders are obliged to tie a &s;a&s;h round their wai&s;ts to pre&s;erve the power of re&s;piration, and cover the whole of the face ex|cept the eyes, to prevent their &s;uffering from the &s;trong current of air occa&s;ioned by the rapid motion of the animal. It is computed that, in an
<PB N="68" REF="027216_0076_0FD3E04D8FAF3688">
ordinary way, a dromedary will perform a jour|ney of five hundred miles in four days.</P>
<P>The oxen and &s;heep of this country are &s;mall; but their fle&s;h is well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The hides of the former, and the wool of the latter, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth articles of exportation. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with large tails, di&s;tingui&s;hed in England by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> name of Barbary &s;heep, are here very &s;carce, and are more indigenous to the Ea&s;tern parts of Barbary. The hor&s;es, for want of attention in keeping up the breed, are much le&s;s valuable than they formerly were; there are &s;till however &s;ome few that are good in the country, and tho&s;e are generally &s;trong, and have great &s;pirit. The mules are numerous and u&s;eful, though I do not think them equal to tho&s;e of Spain, either in &s;ize or beauty.</P>
<P>Fowls and pigeons are remarkably plentiful and good in the empire of Morocco; but ducks are &s;carce, and gee&s;e and turkies I never &s;aw there. The country abounds with the red-legged partridge. In the proper &s;ea&s;on the frankolin, a bird of the partridge &s;pecies, of a delicious flavour, and beautiful pumage, is found here; al&s;o a few woodcocks, &s;nipes in great numbers, all kinds of water-fowl, and a variety of &s;mall &s;inging-birds. Storks are are very plentiful, and as they are never mole&s;ted by the Moors, who are taught to believe it &s;inful to de&s;troy them, they become quite dome&s;tic and tame. They are generally to be &s;een feeding among ruinous walls and ca&s;tles, where they pick up in&s;ects and &s;nakes. Hares, rabbits, antelopes, porcupines, apes, foxes, wild cats, &amp;c. are all natives of this empire.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="027216_0077_0FD3E050000399E0">Among the ferocious animals may be enumer|ated wolves and wild boars, which are &s;pread over the whole empire; and in the &s;outhern pro|vinces, there are lions, tygers, and mon&s;trous &s;erpents.</P>
<P>During my re&s;idence in the country, I had frequent opportunities of examining that mo&s;t &s;ingular of the animal productions, the cameleon. Though it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to adduce any proof to the philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent day again&s;t the vulgar error that it feeds only upon air, yet it may afford &s;ome &s;atisfaction to my readers to be told that I had an opportunity of &s;eeing a com|plete refutation of this opinion at Mogodore. A gentleman of my acquaintance there had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a cameleon, the dexterity of which in procuring its food I had ample means of ob&s;erv|ing. The fact is, its principal &s;upport is flies, which it catches by darting at them an exceed|ingly long tongue covered with a matter &s;o very glutinous, that if it but touches an in&s;ect it is impo&s;&s;ible for it to e&s;cape. The mo&s;t &s;ingular part of its conformation however, (if, perhaps, we except the power of varying its colours) is the eye, the mu&s;cles of which are &s;o con&s;tructed that it can move the ball quite round; and I believe it exi&s;ts the only known in&s;tance in all animated nature of a creature which is able to direct its vi&s;ion to two different objects at the &s;ame time, however tho&s;e objects may be &s;ituated. Except in the act of darting out its tongue to pro|cure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, its motions are remarkably &s;low.</P>
<P>Although it mu&s;t be allowed that the climate of Morocco is delightful to a degree, yet it is
<PB N="70" REF="027216_0078_0FD3E051220A3FA8">
occa&s;ionally &s;ubject to great droughts, which na|turally produce immen&s;e &s;warms of locu&s;ts, the mo&s;t de&s;tructive enemy to vegetation that exi&s;ts. In the year 1778 the&s;e in&s;ects came in &s;uch num|bers from the South, that they perfectly darkened the air, and, by de&s;troying all the corn, produced a general famine. This calamity was increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree in the year 1780, that &s;everal unfortunate per&s;ons actually died in the &s;treets for want of food; many were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of digging in the earth for roots to &s;upply the ur|gent calls of nature; while others were happy to find &s;ome undige&s;ted corn in the dung of animals, which they mo&s;t eagerly devoured. Upon this occa&s;ion of public di&s;tre&s;s the emperor generou&s;ly opened his &s;tore of corn, and di&s;tributed it, as well as money, among his &s;ubjects; and every per&s;on who was known to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;tores was obliged to follow his example. Th&s;e melancholy facts are &s;o recent in the memory of the people, that they &s;till repeat them to the Europeans who vi&s;it the country.</P>
<P>The manufactures of the empire are the haick, which, as was before ob&s;erved, is a long garment compo&s;ed of white wool and cotton, or cotton and &s;ilk woven together, and is u&s;ed by the Moors for the purpo&s;e of covering their under dre&s;s when they go abroad, which they do by totally wrapping them&s;elves in it in a carele&s;s but ea&s;y manner; &s;ilk handkerchiefs of a particular kind, prepared only at Fez; &s;ilks checquered with cot|ton; carpeting little inferior to that of Turkey; beautiful matting, made of the palmetto or wild palm tree; paper of a coar&s;e kind; Cordovan,
<PB N="71" REF="027216_0079_0FD3E052A0564648">
commonly called Morocco leather, gun-powder of an inferior nature; and long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;|quets, made of Bi&s;cay iron. The Moors are un|acquainted with the mode of ca&s;ting cannon, and therefore tho&s;e few which are now in the country are pre&s;ents from Europeans. The manufacture of gla&s;s is likewi&s;e unknown to them; as indeed they make great u&s;e of earthen ware, and have few or no windows to their hou&s;es, this commo|dity may be of le&s;s importance to them than many others. They make butter, by putting the milk into a goat-&s;kin with its outward coat turned in|wards, and &s;haking it till the butter collects on the &s;ides, when it is taken out for u&s;e. From this operation it proves always full of hairs, and has an in&s;ipid flavour. Their chee&s;e con&s;i&s;ts merely of curds hardened and dried, and has uniformly a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. The bread in &s;ome of the principal towns particularly at Tangier and Sallee, is remarkably good, but in many other places, it is coar&s;e, black, and heavy.</P>
<P>Their markets are under more &s;trict regulations than might be expected from a people who are &s;o deficient in mo&s;t other in&s;tances. A proper of|ficer, entitled Almota&s;on, or Mayor, is appointed to in&s;pect all kinds of provi&s;ions and corn, and, according to their plenty or &s;carcity, to fix the price on each article: it is al&s;o the duty of this officer to attend con&s;tantly the markets, and to &s;ee that no per&s;on is guilty of overcharging what he &s;ells, for which, upon detection, the offender is puni&s;hed, by having his hands tied behind him, and being publicly &s;logged through all the &s;treets, the executioner occa&s;ionally exclaiming, "Thus
<PB N="72" REF="027216_0080_0FD3E054CDE00080">
do we treat th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who impo&s;e upon the poor." Provi&s;ions both of the animal and vegetable kind are &s;old by the Rtab, or large pound, con&s;i&s;ting of the weight of twenty hard dollars, or Spani&s;h ounces; corn, by the Almood, four of which are equal to a Faneg Spani&s;h, or &s;ack; and articles of merchandize, by the &s;mall pound of &s;ixteen Spani&s;h ounces, when &s;old by weight; and by the Code, which is about two thirds of an En|gli&s;h yard, when by mea&s;urement.</P>
<P>The Moors, agreeably to the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom, cut the throats of all the animals they eat, at the &s;ame time turning their heads towards Mecca, in adoration of their prophet. After &s;uffering them to bleed freely, they carefully wa&s;h all the remain|ing blood away, and divide the meat into &s;mall pieces of about one or two pounds in weight. As they are unacquainted with the invention of pumps, and have but few &s;prings, it affords em|ployment to a number of indigent people, who would probably be idle otherwi&s;e, to carry water in &s;kins from the neare&s;t river or re&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ir, and &s;ell it to the inhabitants. From their being obliged to tar the &s;kins to prevent them from leaking, the water is frequently rendered very unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Their looms, forges, ploughs, carpenter's tools, &amp;c. are much upon the &s;ame con&s;truction with the unimproved in&s;truments of the &s;ame kind which are u&s;ed at this time in &s;ome parts of Europe, only &s;till more clum&s;ily fini&s;hed. In their work they attend more to &s;trength than neat|ne&s;s or convenience, and, like all other ignorant people they have no idea that what they do is capable of improvement. It is probable, indeed,
<PB N="73" REF="027216_0081_0FD3E058A7E2C508">
that the Moors have undergone no very material change &s;ince the revolution in their arts and &s;ci|ences which took place &s;oon after their expul&s;ion from Spain. Previous to that period it is well known they were an enlightened people, at a time when the greater part of Europe was involved in ignorance and barbari&s;m; but owing to the weak|ne&s;s and tyranny of their princes, they gradually &s;unk into the very oppo&s;ite extreme, and may now be con&s;idered as but a few degrees removed from a &s;avage &s;tate.</P>
<P>They u&s;e no kind of wheel-carriage, and there|fore all their articles of burden are tran&s;ported from one place to another on camels, mules, or a&s;&s;es. Their buildings though by no means con|&s;tructed on any fixed principle of architecture, have at lea&s;t the merit of being very &s;trong and durable. The manner of preparing tabby, of which all their be&s;t edifices are formed, is, I be|lieve, the only remains of their ancient knowledge at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting. It con&s;i&s;ts of a mixture of mortar and very &s;mall &s;tones, beaten tight in a wooden ca&s;e, and then &s;uffered to dry, when it forms a cement equal to the &s;olid rock. There are always unaccountable di&s;crepancies and incon|&s;i&s;tencies in the arts of uncivilized nations. The apartments are if po&s;&s;ible even more inconvenient than tho&s;e of their neighbours the Spaniards; but the carved wood-work with which many of them are ornamented is really equal to any I have ever &s;een in Europe.</P>
<P>The Moors have no idea of making high roads, or repairing tho&s;e which have been formed by the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the country, or perhaps by
<PB N="74" REF="027216_0082_0FD3E05AD00E9C68">
the mere re&s;ort of pa&s;&s;engers, but are content to leave them in the &s;ame &s;tate in which they found them. Indeed, they are even incapable of com|prehending the &s;imple fact&mdash;that by improving the roads travelling would become more expedi|tious, and le&s;s expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>If we look for any of the elegant appendages of luxury and refinement in this country, we &s;hall be grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed. Their gardens are mere tracts of inclo&s;ed ground, over-run with weeds, inter&s;per&s;ed with vines, figs, oranges, and lemons, without ta&s;te or di&s;po&s;ition, and having perhaps one &s;trait walk through the whole. They &s;ometimes &s;ow corn in the intermediate ground; but their gardens are rarely productive of e&s;cu|lent vegetables, and &s;eldom or never ornamented with flowers.</P>
<P>As there are few or no bridges in the country. I am inclined to believe the Moors are not tho|roughly acquainted with the mode of con&s;tructing large arches; and it is only at their &s;ea-ports where they even u&s;e boats. The&s;e circum&s;tances, united to the bad roads, render this part of Bar|bary very inconvenient and dangerous to be tra|velled through.</P>
<P>The country throughout is ill-watered. Mo&s;t of the rivers, which, however, are very few in proportion to the extent of ground, except ju&s;t at their &s;ea-ports, de&s;erve only the name of rivu|lets, and in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on are many of them dried up. From all the&s;e circum&s;tances it may be conjectured that the population is not extraordi|nary. When on my return, in my journey from Morocco to Sallee, which required &s;even days to
<PB N="75" REF="027216_0083_0FD3E05D1480CB68">
accompli&s;h, I met with no habitations but a few Arab tents &s;cattered in different parts; and I had rea&s;on to believe that a great part of the interior country is nearly in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. The towns are very few in proportion to the extent of coun|try, and tho&s;e are but thinly inhabited, Indeed Morocco, which is a metropolis, has many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;es in ruins and uninhabited.</P>
<P>The want of population in the empire of Morocco, at this period may have been occa&s;ioned, in &s;ome degree by the enormous cruelties exer|ci&s;ed by its former &s;overeigns, who have been known, not unfrequently, through a &s;light di&s;|gu&s;t to abandon a whole town or province to the &s;word. In the character of Muley I&s;hmael, grand|father to Sidi Mahomet, we find the mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar incon&s;i&s;tencies; for it is certain, that although a tyrant of the cla&s;s which I have been de&s;cribing, yet in other re&s;pects, as if to repair the mi&s;chief which he committed, he left nothing undone for the encouragement of population. He introduced large colonies of Negroes from Guinea, built towns for them, many of which are &s;till remain|ing, a&s;&s;igned them portions of land, and encou|raged their encrea&s;e by every po&s;&s;ible means. He &s;oon initiated them in the Mahometan faith, and, had his plan been followed, the country by this time would have been populous, and probably flouri&s;hing. As the Negroes are of a more lively, active, and enterprizing di&s;po&s;ition than the Moors, they might &s;oon have been taught the arts of agriculture, and their &s;ingular inge|nuity might have been directed to other u&s;eful purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="027216_0084_0FD3E05E91A22130">It is true Muley I&s;hmael, when he adopted this plan, had more objects in view than that of mere|ly peopling his dominions: he &s;aw plainly that his own &s;ubjects were of too capricious a di&s;po|&s;ition to form &s;oldiers calculated for his tyranni|cal purpo&s;es. They had uniformly manife&s;ted an inclination to change their &s;overeigns, though more from the love of variety than to reform the government, or re&s;train the abu&s;es of tyran|ny. In &s;hort, whatever revolutions took place in the country con&s;i&s;ted merely in a change of one tyrant for another. Muley I&s;hmael had di&s;cernment enough to &s;ee, therefore, that by forming an army of &s;laves who&s;e &s;ole depend|ence &s;hould re&s;t upon their ma&s;ter, he could ea&s;ily train them in &s;uch a manner as to act in the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to his wi&s;hes. He &s;oon learnt that the great object with the Ne|groes was plenty of money, and liberty of plun|der; in the&s;e he liberally indulged them, and the plan fully an&s;wered his expectations.</P>
<P>Though, however, Muley I&s;hmael had no great merit in introducing &s;ubjects for the purpo&s;es of tyranny, yet the good effects of this new coloniza|tion were very generally experienced. By inter|marrying among them&s;elves, and intermixing among the Moors (for the Moors will keep Ne|gro women as concubines, though they &s;eldom marry them) a new race of people &s;tarted up, who became as u&s;eful &s;ubjects as the native inhabitants, and brought the empire into a much more flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate than it had ever been in &s;ince their great revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="027216_0085_0FD3E0604FFE2D60">Sidi Mahomet had different views, and was actuated by different motives. From his inordinate avarice, he cea&s;ed to act towards his black troops in the generous manner which had di&s;tingui&s;hed his predece&s;&s;or Muley I&s;hmael; and they &s;oon &s;hewed them&s;elves di&s;contented with his conduct. They frequently threatened to revolt, and &s;upport tho&s;e of his &s;ons who were in oppo&s;ition, and who promi&s;ed them the mo&s;t liberal rewards. They offered to place his elde&s;t &s;on Muley Ali, who is &s;ince dead, on the throne; but this prince, not unmindful of the duty which he owed his father and &s;overeign, declined their offer. They next applied to Muley Yazid, the late emperor, who at fir&s;t accepted of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they tendered, but in a &s;hort time relinqui&s;hed the plan.</P>
<P>Sidi Mahomet, di&s;gu&s;ted with this conduct of the Negroes, determined to curb their growing power, by di&s;banding a con&s;iderable part of the&s;e troops, and bani&s;hing them to di&s;tant parts of the empire. This important mode of population has therefore been of late years neglected, while no better &s;y&s;tem has been &s;ub&s;tituted in its room; for though the late emperor indulged in cruelty much le&s;s frequently than his predece&s;&s;ors, yet popula|tion has, perhaps, been more completely impeded by the general poverty which he has introduced into the country by his &s;evere exactions, than if he had made a liberal u&s;e of the &s;word or of the bow-&s;tring. To acquaint Sidi Mahomet that any of his &s;ubjects were rich, was equivalent to telling him that he had &s;o many ambitious opponents, who by their wealth would &s;upport his &s;ons in rebellion, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent, by depriving them of tho&s;e riches.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="027216_0086_0FD3E061930B5DC0">The only maxim of government therefore a|dopted by this monarch was to keep his &s;ubjects as nearly as po&s;&s;ible upon a level; that is, in a &s;tate of poverty. This he mo&s;t effectually accompli&s;h|ed. No man who had property one day could with certainty call it his own the next. The mo&s;t devoted mi&s;ers, with their utmo&s;t ingenuity, were unable to evade the di&s;covery of their trea&s;ure. If the victim of tyranny manife&s;ted any reluctance to reveal to his inqui&s;itors the &s;acred depo&s;itory of his hoarded wealth, the emperor &s;eldom he&s;ita|ted about the means of compul&s;ion. The forti|tude of &s;everal enabled them to re&s;i&s;t every tor|ture &s;hort of death; but the love of life was al|ways found to prevail over even avarice it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But this perhaps was not the wor&s;t; the heavy taxes and duties impo&s;ed by this impolitic monarch impeded commerce, and di&s;couraged manufac|tures; and on the whole I am inclined to believe that the country was never in a greater &s;tate of poverty than during his reign.</P>
<P>Power and weakne&s;s, rank and meanne&s;s, opu|lence and indigence, are here equally dependent, equally uncertain. There are in&s;tances of the &s;ul|tan elevating at once a common &s;oldier to the rank of a ba&s;haw, or making him a confidential friend; the following day he would perhaps impri&s;on him, or reduce him again to the &s;tation of a private &s;oldier. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that men under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances &s;hould be ambitious of rank, or de&s;i|rous of riches and power. Yet &s;uch is the di&s;|po&s;ition of the&s;e people, that they have an un|bounded thir&s;t for rank and power with all their uncertainties; and, what is more extraordinary, when they have obtained a high &s;tation they &s;el|dom

fail to afford their &s;overeign a plea for ill-treating them, by abu&s;ing, in &s;ome way or other, their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The only independent people in the country, if it be at all lawful to make u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion when &s;peaking of Morocco, are to be found among the merchants who re&s;ide in towns at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government. The neatne&s;s of their hou&s;es and gardens, the furniture of their apartments, their rich di&s;play of china and gla&s;s, and their liberal treatment of &s;trangers, their bet|ter education, and more enlightened ideas, all &s;erve to point them out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cla&s;s of beings diffe|rent from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h this de&s;cription would apply generally to all the people in trade; but I am &s;orry to add it does not: it is confined to a particular cla&s;s of merchants, who tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s upon a very large &s;cale. Even the&s;e, however, though di&s;tant from the &s;eat of government, be&s;ides, rigorou&s;ly paying their quota of every &s;evere tax which the emperor chu&s;es to impo&s;e upon them, are not always exempt from plunder. If the ba&s;haw or Alcaide of the town can di&s;cover a plea for impri&s;oning them, which he sometimes does without much regard to ju&s;tice, he &s;eldom fails to turn it to his own advantage; and not unfrequently di&s;graces his ma&s;ter's royal name, by u&s;ing it as a pretext for &s;eizing their property.&mdash;Thus the empire of Morocco, in all its parts, pre&s;ents a &s;triking picture of the wretched policy and mi&s;erable con&s;equences of de&s;potic government.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Had not re&s;ted from the fatigues of my journey above &s;ix days at Mogodore, before a new &s;cene was opened, by the return of the me&s;&s;enger from Tarudant, with orders for my immediate attendance on my royal patient. In addition to my former party, I was allowed by the governor three Negro foot-&s;oldiers, armed with mu&s;kets and &s;abres, an elegant tent, and a Jewi&s;h inter|preter, who was perfect ma&s;ter of both Arabic and Engli&s;h, and from whom in the end I derived the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ervices. The Jew who had been pre&s;&s;ed in &s;o &s;ingular a manner into my &s;ervice at Tangier was immediately, and doubtle&s;s much to his own &s;atisfaction, &s;ent home.</P>
<P>We performed a journey of &s;eventy-&s;ix miles, from Mogodore to Santa Cruz, in about thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

days, which from the former part of this Narrative the reader will perceive is not remarkably &s;low travelling, in Morocco, however &s;ingular &s;uch a progre&s;s would appear on the level turnpikes of England. Our journey, which was on the &s;ea|coa&s;t, pre&s;ented to our view one continued expan&s;e of wild, mountainous, and rocky country, and we had con&s;equently very bad roads. Our pro|gre&s;s indeed could be compared to nothing but the continual a&s;cending and de&s;cending of a &s;eries of rough and uneven &s;tone &s;teps. At one place in particular the de&s;cent was &s;o &s;teep, and the road &s;o choaked up with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arge pieces of &s;tone, that we were all obliged to di&s;mount, and walk a full mile and a half with the utmo&s;t caution and difficulty, before we could mount again.</P>
<P>Santa Cruz is a &s;ea-port, &s;ituated on the decli|vity of a high and &s;teep mountain, forming the We&s;tern termination of that chain of mountains, which nearly divides the emperor's dominions into two parts, &s;o well known by the name of the Atlas. It formerly belonged to the Portugueze, and till the acce&s;&s;ion of Sidi Mahomet was the prin|cipal place whence Europeans were allowed to trade. It is at pre&s;ent a de&s;erted town, with only a few hou&s;es, wich are almo&s;t hourly mouldering to decay. The port appears to be much more &s;ecure than that of Mogodore; and from the vicinity of Santa Cruz to the Southern provinces, it appears to me to be the part of the empire which is be&s;t adapted to all the purpo&s;es of commerce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As Santa Cruz, before the reign of Sidi Mahomet, was, and is &s;till capable of being made of great commercial im|portance to Europe; and as its origin will afford &s;ome idea how the Portugueze came to &s;ettle upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;t; I mu&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s upon the reader's patience, while I rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, from an eminent Spani&s;h author, in what manner it was fir&s;t rai&s;ed; as well as its &s;ub&s;equent &s;tate while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Moors, in the year 1737, from the manu&s;cript of an Engli&s;h gentle|man who was re&s;ident in the country at that period.</P>
<P>"Agader Aguer, which the Europeans call Santa Cruz, is a town of modern fabric; nor can I any where find that the &s;pot of ground on which it &s;tands was ever actual|ly inhabited, till the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century. Then, or very &s;oon before, in the reign of Don Manuel, King of Portugal, a certain Portugueze adventurer under|took to &s;ettle there, on account of the quantity of excellent fi&s;h with which its bay abounded; and found means to build him&s;elf a timber fort or ca&s;tle, which he garri&s;oned with his followers, naming his &s;ettlement Santa Cruz, or Holy Cro&s;s; his African neighbours calling it Dar al R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or the Chri&s;tian Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>"Don Manuel &s;oon after fore&s;eeing the great importance of this place to the navigation of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;eas, and to his pro|jected conque&s;t of the we&s;tern parts of Barbary, took it into his own hands, reimbur&s;ing the adventurer who had founded it, all his expences, and making him other gratui|ties. Santa Cruz being thus annexed to the kingdom of Portugal, it was &s;oon enlarged, fortified, and well inha|bited; and as this part of the world was at that time divided among &s;everal petty &s;overeigns, generally at variance with each other, it afforded the new colony, as well as many others upon the &s;ame coa&s;t, an opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a firm foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the country, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a number of di&s;|contented Arabs and Moors, with a view of revenging them&s;elves on their various adventures, to &s;wear allegiance to his Portugueze Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>"The a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rded by the&s;e people to the Chri&s;tian garri&s;ons, enabled them to make frequent incur&s;ions a con&s;iderable way up the country, plundering and &s;eizing upon a great number of the inhabitants, whom they &s;ent over to Europe as &s;laves. At this period, the Portugueze had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves &s;o firmly on the African coa&s;t, that had not the family of Sharifs &s;tarted up, and the attention of the&s;e Chri&s;tian adventurers been diverted to their new acqui&s;itions in America, the greate&s;t part of the country would in a &s;hort time have been com|pletely depopulated, and the Portugueze would have e&s;tabli&s;hed in it a permanent &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>"The&s;e Sharifs, from whom the pre&s;ent royal family of Morocco are immediately de&s;cended, ob&s;erving the va|riance between the people and their different &s;overeigns, and taking advantage of their credulity, pretended that they were lineally de&s;cended from Mahomet, and that they were &s;ent by him to protect his followers from the oppre&s;|&s;ions of their &s;overeigns. They &s;oon made converts to their &s;tandard, and in a &s;hort time e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the &s;overeignty of all the &s;outhern parts of Barbary. In order to add importance to their government, and know|ing that it would flatter the prejudices of their &s;ubjects, who had been &s;o continually hara&s;&s;ed by their Chri&s;tian neighbours, they determined upon expelling the Portu|gueze from Santa Cruz, and if &s;ucce&s;sful, to carry on their attacks again&s;t the other Chri&s;tian garri&s;ons upon the Bar|bary coa&s;t.</P>
<P>"For this purpo&s;e, in the year 1536, an army of 50,000 men, hor&s;e and foot, was rai&s;ed with all expedition, and put under the command of Muley Hamed al Ha&s;&s;an, who with this force completely inve&s;ted the garri&s;on. After many un&s;ucce&s;sful attacks on the part of the Moors, Santa Cruz at la&s;t owed its de&s;truction to the negligence of one of its own people; who carrying a lighted match into the powder-magazine, it unfortunately blew up, and by its concu&s;&s;ion made a large breach in the wall; of which the Moors availing them&s;elves, they immediately recovered their &s;pirits, and, headed by their commander, ha&s;tened in force up to the breach, before the a&s;toni&s;hed Portugueze had time to apply a proper remedy to this unfore&s;een ac|cident. They now attacked their enemy with &s;o much energy, and with &s;uch &s;uperior numbers, that they &s;oon reduced the garri&s;on, and put every per&s;on in it to the &s;word.</P>
<P>"Thus did Santa Cruz fall into the hands of the Moors, by whom it has ever &s;ince been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The lo&s;s of this important place proved extremely injurious to the Portu|gueze navigation to Guinea and India, by affording a har|bour to their European enemies, who&s;e &s;hips were accu&s;|tomed to &s;lip out from this port, and to plunder and take the Portugueze as they pa&s;&s;ed by; while they &s;upplied tho&s;e barbarians with powder, cannon, and other warlike &s;tores, enabling the Moors by that means, in the cour&s;e of time, to attack the other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Portugueze in Africa."</P>
<P>My Engli&s;h author, who dates his manu&s;cript in January 1737, gives the following account of Santa Cruz:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Santa Cruz is a city of Africa, in the kingdom of Suz, &s;ubject to the Emperor of Fez and Morocco, &s;ituated in a temperate air, on a mountain di&s;tant about half a league from the &s;ea, in the latitude 30 deg. 35 min. North, &s;even leagues from Cape de Guerra, &s;ixty from Morocco, one hundred and forty from Fez, and one hundred and fifty from Mequinez. It is in circumference about three quar|ters of a mile, of a &s;quare form, the four &s;ides fronting the four quarters of the world. On the ea&s;t, it has a &s;pacious plan of &s;and; on the we&s;t, the &s;ea; to the north, about the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile, is a &s;mall village, con|taining about twenty inhabitants; and on the &s;outh is its entrance, oppo&s;ite to the mount of Tylde.</P>
<P>"The town is encompa&s;&s;ed with walls defended by &s;even ba&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, having artillery mounted on them which carry between four and &s;ix pound balls; there are al&s;o &s;ome &s;ix|teen and twenty-four pounders, but, owing to their not having proper per&s;ons to work them, tho&s;e pieces of ord|nance are &s;uffered to lie on the ground half buried, render|ing them by that means entirely u&s;ele&s;s. The walls indeed are only of &s;ufficient &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t an attack from their neighbouring enemies, the Arabs, who have no ordnance to oppo&s;e them with, but they could by no means with|&s;tand even a weak cannonade from a regular appointed artillery.</P>
<P>"Santa Cruz is a place of con&s;iderable trade, owing to the great quantities of copper which they procure from mines in the neighbourhood of Tafilet. It is al&s;o plentiful|ly &s;tored with various other merchandizes, &s;uch as wax pro|cured from Heja Saxit and Morocco, the be&s;t in the country, Morocco leather, yellow leather of Tafilet, almonds, gum arabic, gum &s;andarac, o&s;trich feathers, elephants teeth, gold du&s;t, and &s;alt petre, which is exported with &s;ome difficulty owing to its being contraband. There are al&s;o other merchandizes of European Manufacture, &s;uch as iron, leather from Buenos Ayres, mu&s;quets, &s;words, and all kinds of hard-ware, &amp;c. as well as tho&s;e of A&s;ia and the ea&s;tern parts of Africa, brought thither by caravans. The people are for the mo&s;t part of a tawny, &s;un-burnt complexion, &s;pare and lean in body, but active, &s;trong, and capable of undergoing any labour or hard&s;hip, pretty good oeconomi&s;ts, not much addicted to prodigality or vanity, and are dexterous and active in their trade and bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Santa Cruz before Sidi Mahomet ordered it to be evacuated by the European merchants: and it is impo&s;&s;ible to read this account without being con|vinced that what I have advanced, with re&s;pect to its im|portance in a commercial view, is not beyond the truth.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>There is not much of magnificence, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in this introduction, nor did any thing occur to counteract the unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion, previous to our entering the apartment of the prince. The chamber into which I was conducted, I found a &s;mall room with &s;eats in the walls; and there it is cu&s;tomany for all per&s;ons to wait till their names are announced. I ob&s;erved a number of &s;ingular looking per&s;ons attending here; and as I was not much di&s;po&s;ed to make one of their company, in&s;tead of &s;itting, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf, as Europeans do, with walking about the room.

<P>After being detained in this di&s;agreeable &s;itua|tion for about an hour, orders were brought from the prince for my immediate introduction with my

interpreter. From the chamber where we had been waiting, we pa&s;&s;ed through a long and dark entry, which at its termination introduced us to a &s;quare court-yard, floored with checquered tiling, into which the prince's room opened, by means of large folding-doors. The&s;e were curi|ou&s;ly painted with various colours, in the form of checquers. The immediate entrance to the room was neat; it was a very large arched door|way, curiou&s;ly ornamented with checquered tile|ing, and forming a &s;mall porch, or antichamber. The room was lofty, &s;quare, and floored with checquered tiling; the walls &s;tuccoed, and the cieling painted of various colours. Much of the beauty of the room was lo&s;t for want of win|dows, which is a defect ob&s;ervable in mo&s;t Moori&s;h hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I found the prince &s;itting cro&s;s-legged, on a matra&s;s covered with fine white linen, and placed on the floor; this, with a narrow and long piece of carpeting that fronted him on which were &s;eated his Moori&s;h friends, was the only furniture in the room. Upon my fir&s;t entrance, and delivering the con&s;ul's letter of introduction, which acccording to the cu&s;tom of the country, was pre&s;ented in a &s;ilk handkercief, I was ad|dre&s;&s;ed by the prince with the &s;alutation <HI>Bono <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibib, bono Anglai&s;e;</HI> which is a mixture of Arabic and Spani&s;h, meaning, "You are a good doctor, the Engli&s;h are good;" and was ordered with my interpreter to &s;it down on the floor, between the prince and his vi&s;itors; when I was immediately interrogated by every one pre&s;ent, each having a

<P>The prince expre&s;&s;ed great plea&s;ure at my arri|val, wi&s;hed to know whether I came voluntarily or not, and whether the Engli&s;h phy&s;icians were in high repute. To the fir&s;t que&s;tion I replied, that I was &s;ent by order of the governor of Gib|raltar: to the &s;econd, I felt it a duty which I owed to truth and to my country, to an&s;wer in the affirmative. He then de&s;ired me immediately to feel his pul&s;e and to examine his eyes, one of which was darkened by a cataract, and the other affected with a paralytic complaint; and reque&s;ted me to inform him, whether I would undertake to cure him, and how &s;oon? My an&s;wer was, that I wi&s;hed to con&s;ider his ca&s;e maturely before I gave my opinion; and in a day or two I &s;hould be a better judge.</P>
<P>One of his particular friends ob&s;erved to him, from &s;eeing me without a beard, for I had &s;haved in the morning, I was too young to be an able phy&s;ician. Another remarked, that I had put powder in my hair on purpo&s;e to di&s;gui&s;e my age; and a third in&s;i&s;ted, that it was not my own hair. But what &s;eemed to produce the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ment among them, was my dre&s;s, which from its clo&s;ene&s;s, the Moori&s;h dre&s;s being quite loo&s;e, they were certain mu&s;t occa&s;ion pain, and be di&s;|agreeably warm.</P>
<P>The reader may be a&s;&s;ured, that a part of this conver&s;ation was not very entertaining to me; and indeed after the great fatigue which I had undergone, I could well have di&s;pen&s;ed with mo&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="027216_0097_0FD3CBA9CE190240">
of their interrogatories; but in&s;tead of the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion and repo&s;e which I wi&s;hed and expected, my patience was exhau&s;ted by the ab&s;urd curi|o&s;ity of the whole court, who one after another intreated me to favour them with my opinion, and inform them of the &s;tate of their health, merely by feeling the pul&s;e. Having acquitted my&s;elf to the be&s;t of my ability in this curious en|quiry, the prince informed me, he had prepared for my reception a good hou&s;e, whither he de&s;ired me to retire, and vi&s;it him the following morning early, when I was to examine his ca&s;e more particularly.</P>
<P>The good hou&s;e promi&s;ed me by the prince, proved to be a mi&s;erable room in the Jew|dry, that is, the part of the &s;uburb inhabited by the Jews, &s;ituated about a quarter of a mile from the town. It was however, the habitation of the prince's principal Jew, and the be&s;t in the place. This apartment which was on the ground floor, was narrow and dirty, having no windows, to it, but opening by means of large folding-doors into a court, where three Jewi&s;h families, who lived all in the &s;ame hou&s;e, threw the whole of their rubbi&s;h and dirt. I &s;uppo&s;e my feelings might be rendered more acute by the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">appoint|ment, for on being introduced into this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> hovel, I was &s;o &s;truck with horror and di&s;gu&s;t that I was on the point of mounting my hor&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of a&s;king the prince for another agree|ment; but upon being told it was the be&s;t in the town, and reflecting that I had voluntarily enter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> upon the&s;e difficulties, I determined to strugg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through them as well as I could, and con&s;ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the pre&s;ent to acquie&s;ce in this indifferent fare.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="027216_0098_0FD3CBAAEA966B88">I took, however, the fir&s;t opportunity of repre|&s;enting my di&s;agreeable &s;ituation to be prince, who gave orders for apartments to be fitted up for me in his garden; but from the &s;lowne&s;s of the ma|&s;ons, they were not fini&s;hed in time for me to oc|cupy them before I left Tarudant. The prince's Jew had directions to &s;upply me with every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary; and while at Tarudant I had no rea&s;on whatever to complain of any inattention on the part of the prince.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my baggage was unpacked, the fir&s;t object that occurred to me was to endeavour, un|der tho&s;e circum&s;tances, to make my &s;ituation as comfortable as the nature of it would admit. At one end of my room I placed my three folding &s;tools, which I had u&s;ed as a bed on the road, and &s;creened it off as well as I could with mats, which I fixed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;s the apartment as a partition. One of my boxes were &s;ub&s;tituted for a table, and another for a chair, not being able to procure either of tho&s;e articles in Tarudant. At the other end of the room my interpreter placed his bed|ding on the floor, where he &s;lept during the whole of our &s;tay.</P>
<P>Having furni&s;hed our room, our next object was to con&s;ider in what manner our cookery was to be performed. The whole of our kitchen fur|niture con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;mall iron &s;auce-pan, one pewter di&s;h, two pewter plates, a horn to drink out of, and two knives and forks. As the Moors are many of them accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of tea, breakfa&s;ting articles we were not at a lo&s;s for. On the road the iron &s;auce-pan had &s;erved very well to boil our eggs and fowls, which, as I be|fore
<PB N="91" REF="027216_0099_0FD3CBAC700CFEB0">
ob&s;erved, were the only food we could pro|cure. But at Tarudant we found our&s;elves in a a land of plenty, without having it in our power to avail our&s;elves of &s;uch an advantage. After a few days inconvenience on this account, I found out a Jew, who contrived to dre&s;s me a few ha&s;hes and &s;tews &s;omething in the Spani&s;h &s;tile, with which fare I was obliged to be &s;atisfied du|ring my re&s;idence at Tarudant.</P>
<P>Two hours before my arrival, the whole of the Engli&s;h people who had been &s;hipwrecked, except the captain and a Negro, pa&s;&s;ed through the town in their way to the Metropolis. They had been re|deemed from the wild Arabs, by Muley Ab&s;ulem, with an intent, I pre&s;ume, of complying with his promi&s;e, but by the emperor's orders were &s;ent up to Morocco.</P>
<P>Upon my vi&s;iting the prince the following day, and examining into the nature of his complaint, I found it to be of the mo&s;t de&s;perate kind; but as I had travelled near five hundred miles to &s;ee him, I could not be &s;atisfied to return back with|out attempting &s;omething; I therefore gave a formal opinion to the prince in writing, &s;tating, that I could by no means ab&s;olutely undertake to cure him; that I could not even flatter him with very great hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; but that if he cho&s;e to give my plan of treatment a trial for a couple or months, we could them judge whether the di&s;|ea&s;e was likely to be removed. This plan was approved of, and he immediately began his cour&s;e of medicines.</P>
<P>I have already intimated, that the prince had totally lo&s;t the u&s;e of one eye by a cataract; and
<PB N="92" REF="027216_0100_0FD3CBADFA4E3948">
I may add, that he had nearly lo&s;t that of the other by a paralytic affection, which threatened to end in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tta &s;erena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this di&s;ea&s;e is to be under&s;tood, &s;uch a &s;tate of the optic nerve as renders it in&s;en&s;ible to the rays of light.</NOTE>, and which had drawn the eye &s;o much towards the no&s;e, as &s;ometimes entirely to exclude the appearance of the pupil. The only remains of &s;ight left, were merely &s;uf|ficient to enable him to &s;ee large bodies without di&s;tingui&s;hing any of them particularly. The &s;pa&s;m was the di&s;ea&s;e which I was ordered to cure.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were by no means the limits of the prince's complaints. For in truth, his whole frame was &s;o enervated by a cour&s;e of debauchery, that I found it nece&s;&s;ary to put him under a &s;trict regimen; to enforce the ob&s;ervance of which, I committed from time to time my directions to writing. They were tran&s;lated into Arabic, and one copy delivered to the prince, and the other to his confidential friend, who undertook, at my reque&s;t, to &s;ee them carried into execution.</P>
<P>As I admini&s;tered internal as well as topical remedies, I made a point of giving them to my patient with my own hand. The prince made no difficulty of &s;wallowing the medicine, however nau&s;eous; but it was a long time before I could make him comprehend, how a medicine intro|duced into the &s;tomach could afford any relief to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t, however, do him the ju&s;tice to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, that I found him a more apt di&s;ciple than any of his attendants. Many of them could not be made at all to under&s;tand the action of medicines,
<PB N="93" REF="027216_0101_0FD3E074828D9468">
and of con&s;equence were full of prejudices again&s;t my mode of treatment.</P>
<P>In a few days after my fir&s;t attendance on the prince, one of his prejudiced friends per&s;uaded his highne&s;s, that I had admini&s;tered medicines to him intended to produce a certain effect upon his con&s;titution, of which I had never entertained &s;o much as an idea before it was mentioned to me. What this effect was I cannot with decency ex|plain. Suffice it to &s;ay that the&s;e malignant in&s;i|nuations had too powerful an effect on the mind of my patient, and he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me upon the &s;ubject in terms which I could not hear without the mo&s;t poignant indignation and un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I vindicated my conduct as well as I was able, under the di&s;advantages of an interpretation by explaining to him how impo&s;&s;ible for the medi|dicines to have the effect he &s;u&s;pected; and how much more to my credit, as well as advantage, it would be to e-e&s;tabli&s;h his health than to do him a prejudice; that a profe&s;&s;ional man had a cha|racter; which when once lo&s;t was irrecoverable; and that therefore I tru&s;ted he would reflect on my &s;ituation, and con&s;ider me in a more favour|able light than his re&s;entment at fir&s;t had led him to &s;ugge&s;t. The prince began now to retract his calumny, by &s;aying that he believed the medicines had produced an effect different from what I in|tended, but that it was the duty of the patient to inform his phy&s;ician of every circum&s;tance which related to his health. In &s;hort, after a variety of explanations, I at la&s;t brought him to con&s;ent to give my plan a few days longer trial, and if then
<PB N="94" REF="027216_0102_0FD3E075D66AF3E0">
there appeared any objections to the pur&s;uing of it, I would willingly con&s;ent to give it up en|tirely. Tho&s;e days being elap&s;ed, and none of the &s;u&s;pected effects appearing, the prince pro|ceeded regularly in the cour&s;e agreeably to my directions.</P>
<P>The intermediate time between my attendance on the prince whom I vi&s;ited twice a-day, was employed in reading a few books which I brought with me from Mogodore, making little excur|&s;ions into the country, and vi&s;iting patients at Tarudant.</P>
<P>Among the latter was the Cadi, or judge of the town. This I found to be a venerable old man, of about &s;eventy years of age, who&s;e beard was become perfectly white, and who&s;e coun|tenance, though doubtle&s;s altered by time, yet &s;till retained a great expre&s;&s;ion of vivacity and &s;en&s;e, mixed with more apparent goodne&s;s of heart than any I had &s;een in the country. He received me with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed his gratitude for my vi&s;it in a manner that appeared &s;trongly marked with &s;incerity. He &s;eemed fully aware that his complaint was merely a decay of nature, and only wi&s;hed me to admi|ni&s;ter &s;omething to him which might palliate his mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms. With a great &s;hare of feeling he expatiated on the inconveniences I mu&s;t undergo, from being at &s;o great a di&s;tance from my friends, and in a part of the world where the manners of the people were &s;o different from what I had been accu&s;tomed to, expre&s;&s;ing his wi&s;h at the &s;ame time to render me every &s;ervice that a per&s;on in his &s;ituation could offer. Such
<PB N="95" REF="027216_0103_0FD3E0774ED39FB0">
an uncommon &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility and reflection, from one who&s;e countrymen are in general in a very &s;mall degree removed from the &s;avage &s;tate, excited in me a warm de&s;ire of rendering my pa|tient a &s;ervice; among the many que&s;tions he put to me, he a&s;ked what was cu&s;tomary for our judges in England to receive as a reward for their &s;ervices. Upon my informing him, the Cadi was in perfect a&s;toni&s;hment: "Good God!" he ex|claimed, <Q>the emperor allows me only fifty ducats (about twelve pounds &s;terling) a year!</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could have it in my power to give as favourable an account of my other patients at Tarudant, as of this re&s;pectable old man. The generality of them proved in&s;olent, ungrateful, and many, who vi&s;ited my habitation, notorious thieves. From my apartment being in the hou&s;e of a Jew, none of whom dare venture to prevent a Moor from entering, I was from morning to night pe&s;tered with Arabs, mountaineers and the wor&s;t de&s;cription of towns-people, who were &s;el|dom &s;atisfied with my advice, but in&s;i&s;ted on my either giving them money, or &s;omething el&s;e equal in value. Many I turned out of my room by force, while with difficulty they re&s;trained their re&s;entment at my conduct, and every moment threatened to draw their knives upon me; to others, who behaved a little better, I gave &s;ome|thing to get rid of them; and to a third who, were real objects of di&s;tre&s;s, I with plea&s;ure ex|tended my utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On the whole, my &s;ituation was &s;uch as to oblige me to complain of it to the prince, who afterwards allowed me a &s;ol|dier to mount guard con&s;tantly at my door, who
<PB N="96" REF="027216_0104_0FD3E079053CE970">
had directions to permit no per&s;on to enter my room without my particular permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure that in about a fortnight after my fir&s;t attendance on the prince, I ob&s;erved an amendment in his complaint. His eye now evinced a di&s;po&s;ition to recover its for|mer po&s;ition; at fir&s;t he was able only to di&s;cern light from darkne&s;s, but he could now di&s;tingui&s;h an apple at about ten yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The&s;e flattering appearances entirely removed every prejudice which at fir&s;t aro&s;e in the minds of the prince's attendants; and his highne&s;s him|&s;elf acknowledged that he had been too ha&s;ty in forming his opinion of me. The confidence which this &s;ucce&s;s occa&s;ioned, induced the prince to ad|mit me into his Harem, where there were &s;everal ladies who had occa&s;ion for my &s;ervices.</P>
<P>Though this afforded me an opportunity of &s;eeing the Harem, I &s;hall wave a particular de|&s;cription of it, as it only differed from that of the the emperor (which I &s;hall hereafter very particu|larly de&s;cribe) by being on a &s;maller &s;cale.</P>
<P>Upon receiving the prince's orders to attend his ladies, one of his friends was immediately di&s;patched with me to the gate of the Harem; with directions to the Alcaide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An officer in the general idea of the word.</NOTE> of the eunuchs to admit my&s;elf and interpreter whenever I thought it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The eunuchs, who have the entire charge of the women, and who in fact live always among them, are the children of Negro &s;laves. They are generally either very &s;hort and fat; or el&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="027216_0105_0FD3E07A816E0EF0">
tall, deformed, and lame. Their voices have that particular tone which is ob&s;ervable in youths who are ju&s;t arriving at manhood; and their per&s;ons al|together afford a di&s;gu&s;ting image of weakne&s;s and effeminacy. From the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their ma&s;ters, and the con&s;equence which it gives them, the eunuchs exceed in in&s;olence and pride every other cla&s;s of people in the country. They di&s;played indeed &s;o much of it towards me, that I was obliged, in my own defence, to com|plain of them once or twice, and to have them puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Attended by one of the&s;e people, after pa&s;&s;ing the gate of the Harem, which is always locked, and under the care of a guard of eunuchs, we entered a narrow and dark pa&s;&s;age, which &s;oon brought us to the court, into which the wo|men's chambers open. We here &s;aw numbers of both black and white women and children; &s;ome concubines, &s;ome &s;laves, and others hired do|me&s;tics.</P>
<P>Upon their ob&s;erving the unu&s;ual figure of an European, the whole multitude in a body &s;ur|rounded me, and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ment at my dre&s;s and appearance. Some &s;tood motionle&s;s with their hands lifted up, their eyes fixed, and their mouths open, in the u&s;ual atti|tude of wonder and &s;urprize. Some bur&s;t into immoderate fits of laughter; while others again came up, and, with uncommon attention, eyed me from head to foot. The parts of my dre&s;s which &s;eemed mo&s;t to attract their notice were my buckles, buttons, and &s;tockings; for neither men nor women in this country wear any thing of the
<PB N="98" REF="027216_0106_0FD3E07BE581D268">
kind. With re&s;pect to the club of my hair, they &s;eemed utterly at a lo&s;s in what view to con&s;ider it; but the powder which I wore they conceived to be employed for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying ver|min. Mo&s;t of the children when they &s;aw me, ran away in the mo&s;t perfect con&s;ternation; and on the whole I appeared as &s;ingular an animal, and I dare &s;ay had the honour of exciting as much curio&s;ity and attention, as a lion, or a man-tiger ju&s;t imported from abroad, and introduced into a country town in England on a market-day. Every time I vi&s;ited the Harem I was &s;urrounded and laughed at by this curious mob, who, on my entering the gate, followed me clo&s;e to the very chamber to which I was proceeding, and on my return univer&s;ally e&s;corted me out.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the women were uncom|monly fat and unwieldy; had black and full eyes, round faces, with &s;mall no&s;es. They were of different complexions; &s;ome very fair, &s;ome &s;allow, and others again perfect Negroes.</P>
<P>One of my new patients being ready to re|ceive me, I was de&s;ired to walk into her room; where, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aw nothing but a curtain drawn quite acro&s;s the apartment, &s;imilar to that of a theatre which &s;eparates the &s;tage from the audience. A female dome&s;tic brought a very low &s;tool, placed it near the cur|tain, and told me I was to &s;it down there, and feel her mi&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s pul&s;e.</P>
<P>The lady, who had by this time &s;ummoned up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">age to &s;peak, introduced her hand from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ottom of the curtain, and de&s;ired me to inform her of all her complaints, which &s;he conceived I
<PB N="99" REF="027216_0107_0FD3E07D720A3610">
might perfectly perceive by merely feeling the pul&s;e. It was in vain to a&s;k her where her pain was &s;eated, whether in her &s;tomach, head, or back; the only an&s;wer I could procure was a re|que&s;t to feel the pul&s;e of the other hand, and then point out the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the nature of the pain.</P>
<P>Having neither &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity by exhibit|ing her face, nor made me acquainted with the nature of her complaint, I was under the nece&s;&s;i|ty of informing her in po&s;itive terms, that to un|der&s;tand the di&s;ea&s;e it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee the tongue, as well as to feel the pul&s;e; and that without it I could do nothing for her. My eloquence, or rather that of my Jewi&s;h interpreter, was, however, for a long time exerted in vain; and I am per&s;uaded &s;he would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me without any further enquiry, had not her invention &s;upplied her with a happy expedient to remove her embarra&s;&s;ment. She contrived at la&s;t to cut a hole through the curtain, through which &s;he extruded her tongue, and thus complied with my injunction as far as it was nece&s;&s;ary in a medical view, but mo&s;t effectually di&s;appointed my cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I was afterwards ordered to look at another of the prince's wives, who was affected with a &s;cro|phulus &s;welling in her neck. This lady was, in the &s;ame manner as the other, at fir&s;t excluded from my &s;ight; but as &s;he was obliged to &s;hew me her complaint, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing her face, and ob&s;erved it to be very hand&s;ome. I was informed that &s;he had been at one period the favourite of the prince, but owing to this defect
<PB N="100" REF="027216_0108_0FD3E07ED097D550">
he had in a great mea&s;ure de&s;erted her; and this circum&s;tance accounts for the extreme anxiety which &s;he &s;eemed to expre&s;s to get rid of this di&s;|agreeable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had examined her neck, &s;he took off from her dre&s;s the whole of her gold trinkets, which were very numerous, and of con&s;iderable value, put them into my hand, and de&s;ired me to cure her; promi&s;ing a &s;till greater reward if I &s;ucceeded. Con&s;cious of the uncertainty of render|ing her any material &s;ervice, I immediately re|turned the pre&s;ent, and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he might depend on my giving all proper remedies a fair trial, but that I could not be an&s;werable for their &s;ucce&s;s. There is nothing more unplea&s;ant than the inability of giving rea&s;onable ground for hope, when it promi&s;es to be productive of &s;o much hap|pine&s;s to a fellow-creature. It was with pain I ob&s;erved that this poor lady, though &s;omewhat cheered, was yet di&s;&s;atisfied with my reply; &s;he could not refrain from &s;howing evident marks of di&s;appointment, and even di&s;plea&s;ure, at my he&s;ita|tion, by &s;aying, &s;he always under&s;tood that a Chri&s;tian phy&s;ician could cure every di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of my attendance in the Ha|rem, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing mo&s;t of the prince's women, who, exclu&s;ive of the four wives allowed him by his religion, were about twenty in number, and who did not, like his wives, di&s;|cover that invincible reluctance to the di&s;play of their beauty. They at fir&s;t proved very trouble|&s;ome patients; for upon my not telling them all their complaints immediately upon feeling the pul&s;e, they con&s;idered me as an ignorant empiric,
<PB N="101" REF="027216_0109_0FD3E0804C2CED98">
who knew nothing of my profe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides this, I found that each of them flattered them&s;elves with almo&s;t an in&s;tantaneous cure. In &s;hort, after many fruitle&s;s efforts to teach tho&s;e to rea&s;on who had hitherto never made the &s;malle&s;t u&s;e of their under&s;tandings, I was at la&s;t obliged to adapt my deportment to the capacities of my patients, and &s;oon acquired among them as much unde&s;erved commendation as I had incurred unmerited re|proach.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the women in the Harem were under thirty years of age, of a corpulent habit, and of a very aukward gait. Their knowledge of cour&s;e, from having led a life of total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, was entirely confined to the occurrences in their Harem; where, as they were allowed a free acce&s;s to each other, they conver&s;ed upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as their uninformed under&s;tandings &s;erved to furni&s;h them with. They are never &s;uffered to go out, but by an expre&s;s order from the prince; and then only when removing from one place of re&s;idence to another. I in general found them extremely ignorant, proud, and vain of their per&s;ons, even to a degree which bordered up|on childi&s;hne&s;s. Among many ridiculous que&s;|tions, they a&s;ked my interpreter if I could read and write; upon being an&s;wered in the affirmative, they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e and admiration at the abilities of the Chri&s;tians. There was not one among them who could do either; the&s;e rudi|ments of learning are indeed only the lot of a few of their men, who on that account are named Talbs, or explainers of the Mahometan law.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027216_0110_0FD3E0858AE4E120">Among the concubines of the prince there were &s;ix female &s;laves of the age of fifteen, who were pre&s;ented to him by a Moor of di&s;tinction. One of the&s;e was de&s;cended from an Engli&s;h renegado, another from a Spani&s;h, and the other four were of Moori&s;h extraction.</P>
<P>Where the more &s;olid and u&s;eful accompli&s;h|ments are lea&s;t cultivated, a ta&s;te is often found to prevail for tho&s;e which are purely ornamental and frivolous. The&s;e devoted victims of libidnous plea&s;ure received a daily le&s;&s;on of mu&s;ic, by order of the prince, from a Moor who had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome little time in London and Italy, where he had ac|quired a &s;light knowledge of that &s;cience. I had an opportunity of being pre&s;ent at one of the&s;e per|formances, but cannot &s;ay I received much amu&s;e|ment, in a mu&s;ical view, from my vi&s;it. It was a concert vocal and in&s;trumental: the in&s;truments u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion were the mandoline, a kind of violin with only two strings, and the tabor. The principal object in their performance &s;eemed to be noi&s;e; it was without the lea&s;t attention to melody, variety, or ta&s;te, and was merely draw|ing out a wild and melancholy &s;train.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ation, however, forms the principal en|tertainment in the&s;e gloomy retirements. When I vi&s;ited the Harem, I never found the women en|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed in any other employment than that of con|ver&s;ing on the ground in circles. In fact, as all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eedle-work is performed by Jewe&s;&s;es, and their cookery, and the management of their cham|bers, by their &s;laves and dome&s;tics, of which they have a proportionable number, according to the favour they are in with the prince, it is not ea&s;y
<PB N="103" REF="027216_0111_0FD3E0858FC89A88">
for them to find means of occupying their time, and particularly &s;ince none of them are able to read or write. It is impo&s;&s;ible, indeed, to reflect on the &s;ituation of the&s;e unfortunate women without the mo&s;t lively &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion. Excluded from the enjoyment of fre&s;h air and exerci&s;e, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of health and life; de|prived of all &s;ociety but that of their fellow-&s;uf|ferers, a &s;ociety to which mo&s;t of them would pre|fer &s;olitude it&s;elf; they are only to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t abject of &s;laves&mdash;&s;laves to the vices and caprice of a licentious tyrant, who exacts even from his wives them&s;elves a degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect which borders upon idolatry, and which God and nature never meant &s;hould be paid to a mortal.</P>
<P>After the lap&s;e of a third week, there was a con&s;iderable amendment in the prince's complaint. He began to di&s;tingui&s;h very large writing; and he a&s;&s;ured me that he had written with his own hand a letter to the emperor, wherein he informed him of the relief my attendance had afforded him; a&s;&s;uring me, that his father would reward me very hand&s;omely if I effected a cure.</P>
<P>Our intercour&s;e was at this time improved into intimacy. He u&s;ed to &s;ee me without re&s;erve, and often at a time when he had his women with him, which, I was informed, was a mark of con|fidence with which no other man had ever before been honoured. He made me feel their pul&s;es, and obliged one of them, who was remarkably fat and unwieldy, to be held on the floor by two of the others, while I dropped into her eye &s;ome of the &s;ame medicine which I had occa&s;ion to ap|ply
<PB N="104" REF="027216_0112_0FD3E087D0175E98">
to his. The violent but temporary pain brought on by this application produced an im|moderate &s;it of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the prince, as well as in the other ladies; and the object of it, though in mo&s;t violent pain, to evince her re&s;pect to his royal highne&s;s, declared it to be a very plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Upon other occa&s;ions he would detain me for two, and &s;ometimes three hours, enquiring con|cerning European cu&s;toms, and particularly tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, their religion, laws, and govern|ment. He made &s;ome comments upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat I told him, manife&s;ted an earne&s;t de&s;ire of informa|tion, and appeared greatly intere&s;ted in the con|ver&s;ation. At other times, when he had been put out of humour, after I had felt his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e, and admini&s;tered to him the medicines, he would di&s;|mi&s;s me without a&s;king me to &s;it down or even allowing me to a&s;k any further que&s;tions.&mdash;But the curio&s;ity of the reader is probably by this time excited re&s;pecting the per&s;on and character of this prince; and perhaps it cannot be gratified at a more convenient part of the Narrative.</P>
<P>Muley Ab&s;ulem is of the middle &s;ize, of rather a corpulent habit, and about thirty-five years of age. His features are very much disfigured by the great defect in his eyes; the cataract having entirely ob&s;cured one of them, and the other being drawn quite on one &s;ide by the violence of the paralytic affection. The&s;e circum&s;tances, joined to the great natural &s;ize and prominency of both eyes, a bad &s;et of teeth, and a &s;allow complexion, will not allow me to &s;ay that the prince has the smalle&s;t preten&s;ions to the character of hand&s;ome.
<PB N="105" REF="027216_0113_0FD3E0898D9C38F0">
His dre&s;s was the &s;ame as that of other Moors, which I &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe, except a &s;ilk ta&s;&s;el to his turban, which is in this country a di&s;tinctive mark of royalty. When I fir&s;t &s;aw him, he was covered with a loo&s;e &s;urtout, made of red woollen cloth, and edged with fur-&s;kin, which the Moors term a Caftan. Indeed the only di&s;tinction of dre&s;s in this country is in the good or bad qualities of the materials. I have &s;een in&s;tances of private Moors, who&s;e dre&s;s was much richer than that of any of the princes, or even of the emperor him|&s;elf. The attendants of the prince con&s;i&s;ted prin|cipally of &s;oldiers, of which he has an unlimited number, pages, who are generally about his per|&s;on, black eunuchs, and a few black &s;laves.</P>
<P>The character of Muley Ab&s;ulem is marked with le&s;s of &s;everity and cruelty than that of the greater part of the Moori&s;h princes; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es however, at the &s;ame time, le&s;s of that &s;agacity, acutene&s;s, and activity, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the government of &s;o uncivilized a people as the Moors. To be explicit, this prince is naturally of a mild and indolent di&s;po&s;ition; immoderately indulgent to his pa&s;&s;ions, when he can enjoy them without much trouble; and very little ambitious of fame.</P>
<P>Till very lately he had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to drink, to a very great exce&s;s, &s;trong brandy; that he has now entirely relinqui&s;hed, and his principal pa&s;&s;ion &s;ince has been the love of women, which engro&s;&s;es the whole of his attention and time. I ob&s;erved, however, that he allowed his ladies much more indulgence than is in general cu&s;tomary among the Moors; and I found that even in his
<PB N="106" REF="027216_0114_0FD3E08AD1A58C30">
pre&s;ence they conver&s;ed among each other with as much freedom as if they had been by them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>From the &s;ketch which I have given of the prince's character, it will be no difficult matter to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons why his father's wi&s;hes for appointing him his succe&s;&s;or were di&s;appointed. He was rich, it is true, but a great part of his wealth was &s;quandered on &s;en&s;ual gratifications; and the total want of energy in his character prevented his &s;ecuring friends in a country, where cruelty and great activity are con&s;idered as the only characteri&s;tics of &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The advantages of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion can only be &s;een by contemplating the &s;tate of tho&s;e monarchs where it does not exi&s;t. In Morocco, where there is no regular fixed order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, though the emperor is indulged in the formality of nominating his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, yet the &s;word &s;upplies the place of right; and that prince who can acquire the greate&s;t number of friends, and con&s;equently the &s;tronge&s;t army, &s;ucceeds to the throne. This circum&s;tance is often at|tended with the mo&s;t fatal effects, and has given ri&s;e to tho&s;e bloody revolutions which from one period to another have &s;haken and depopulated the empire of Morocco. The emperor Sidi Ma|homet, from having no competitors, enjoyed a much more peaceful reign than any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. How far his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who has &s;everal brothers, each feeling an equal claim to the throne, will be equally &s;ucce&s;sful, time only mu&s;t deter|mine.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS it is quite unfa&s;hionable in this country to go even to the next &s;treet on foot, and as any &s;ituation was at &s;ome di&s;tance from that of the prince, his highne&s;s made me a pre&s;ent of an hor&s;e, which, however, I could not &s;ay was one of the be&s;t in the country. But as I had once engaged in his &s;ervice, I conceived it my intere&s;t to make the be&s;t of every &s;ituation. In the hours, therefore, when my per&s;onal attendance oh my patient was not demanded, I frequently made u&s;e of my Ro&s;inante, both for the purpo&s;e of exerci&s;e, and for the gratification of my curio&s;ity in vi&s;iting every thing which appeared worthy of in&s;pection. The following are the principal ob&s;ervations which I was able to collect in the cour&s;e of my excur|&s;ions; and I flatter my&s;elf they will &s;erve at lea&s;t to give a general idea of the city where I re&s;ided, and its environs.</P>
<P>Tarudant, now the capital of the province of Suz, was formerly, while the empire was divi|ded into petty &s;tates, the metropolis of a kingdom. It lies in a fine but uncultivated plain, about twenty miles to the South of the Atlas, and may be con|&s;idered
<PB N="108" REF="027216_0116_0FD3E08F35A830D8">
as the frontier town of that part of the emperor's dominions. The emperor, it is true, claims the &s;overeignty of the de&s;ert of Zahara, and the territory of Vled de Non. But his autho|rity over that part of the country is almo&s;t nominal; as it entirely depends on the caprice and inclination of the Arabs who inhabit it; and who, from their di&s;tant &s;ituation from the &s;eat of government, are more properly under the dominion of their own chiefs. They acknowledge the emperor to be their &s;overeign, and the head of their church, and occa&s;ionally pay him tribute as &s;uch; but they pay no attention whatever to his particular orders, and over their interior government he has not the lea&s;t controul.</P>
<P>The&s;e people con&s;i&s;t of different tribes of Arabs, who live in tents without any fixed places of re|&s;idence. They wander over the country in &s;earch of plunder, and are &s;uppo&s;ed, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to extend their depredations as far as Nigritia, whence they carry off Negroes. They profe&s;s the Mahometan religion, though they intermix it with a great portion of idolatry; and in the de&s;erts, where no water can be procured for the purpo&s;e of ablution, they &s;ub&s;titute &s;and. Their manner of treating tho&s;e unfortunate mariners who have the misfortune to be &s;hipwrecked on their coa&s;t, I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to repre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>The walls of Tarudant, now half in ruins, are very exten&s;ive, and enclo&s;e a much larger &s;pace of ground than is occupied by the buildings. The hou&s;es, which are compo&s;ed of earth and mud, beaten very tight in a wooden ca&s;e, and
<PB N="109" REF="027216_0117_0FD3E095652FDDF0">
left to be dried by the &s;un, have only appartments on the ground floor; and as each hou&s;e is &s;ur|rounded by a garden and wall, the place alto|gether bears a greater re&s;emblance to a well-peo|pled &s;pot of country, or a collection of hamlets, than a town. This idea is much increased by the number of lofty palm, or date trees, which are intermixed with, and overlook the hou&s;es, af|fording altogether a very rural appearance. The apartments are in general mean and inconvenient, and principally inhabited by the lower cla&s;s of mechanics, as there are very few Moors of di&s;|tinction re&s;iding at Tarudant. It is true, when the prince is there, he brings with him all his attendants and friends, but they generally live in the castle, and are by no means to be con&s;idered as the inhabitants of the town.</P>
<P>From the irregular and &s;traggling manner in which the town is built, it is impo&s;&s;ible to form a conjecture concerning the number of hou&s;es and inhabitants it contains. As its extent, however, is con&s;iderable, it may be accounted an important and populous city, when compared with mo&s;t of the others in the emperor's dominions.</P>
<P>The principal manufactures at Tarudant are making of fine Haicks, and the working of cop|per, which is procured in great plenty from a neighbouring mine. They have a regular market twice a week, where all kinds of cattle and pro|vi&s;ions are brought to be di&s;po&s;ed of. For the &s;ale of hor&s;es and mules, the proprietor of the mar|ket employs men on purpo&s;e to ride, and exhibit the bea&s;ts to the be&s;t advantage, and afterwards to put them up to public auction. In the&s;e &s;ales,
<PB N="110" REF="027216_0118_0FD3E095E152D2A0">
if the highe&s;t bidder does not offer a price agree|able to the owners, they are at liberty to refu&s;e &s;elling them. This cu&s;tom prevents many of tho&s;e impo&s;itions in the &s;ale of cattle, which too fre|quently prevail in European fairs and markets. By this putting the cattle up to public auction, tho&s;e per&s;ons who have really good ones will in general get their full price for them; and tho&s;e buyers, who from their ignorance might be liable to be impo&s;ed upon, can without much difficulty form a tolerable idea of the real value of the animal by the price which others bid.</P>
<P>The Jewdry is a mi&s;erable place, &s;ituated about a quarter of a mile from the town. The inhabitants are in the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of poverty and &s;ub|jection, and when they enter the Moori&s;h town are obliged to go barefooted. The ca&s;tle, which is very exten&s;ive, and &s;ituated halfway between the town and Dar Beyda, the re&s;idence of the prince, is inclo&s;ed in a tolerably neat garden, which was planned by a Frenchman. It is di|vided into three parts; one for the prince, which he occa&s;ionally u&s;es, the other for his women, named the Harem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Europeans have in general an idea, that the place al|lotted for the women to live in is named the Seraglio, This is quite erroneous. Seraglio means properly a palace, and the women's place of re&s;idence is the Harem.</NOTE>, and the third for all those who are in the service of the prince.</P>
<P>As the prince's recovery became daily ob&s;erv|able, I thought I might venture to try him with a large watch which I had with me, to &s;ee whe|ther he could point out the time of the day. In this he &s;ucceeded very well, and had di&s;cern|ment
<PB N="111" REF="027216_0119_0FD3E09794DC1680">
enough to ob&s;erve, that it was an old watch, and in part broken. He therefore begged my acceptance of a very elegant gold one, re|que&s;ting of me to wear it in&s;tead of the other. The hand&s;ome manner in which his highne&s;s made this pre&s;ent gave me a much more flattering idea of his character than his conduct afterwards warranted. But we are to recollect, that he was then in the act of receiving a benefit from me; that the journey which he was afterwards obliged to undertake, put it out of my power to render him any further &s;ervice; and therefore, to an illi|beral and uncultivated mind, the motive for con|tinuing any acts of genero&s;ity or kindne&s;s no longer exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my vi&s;its to the prince, I occa|&s;ionally met with two Moors, one of whom had been in Italy for some time, and the other in England, who could &s;peak a little of the Engli&s;h language. I mention the&s;e men not only from motives of gratitude, but al&s;o to evince, that it is by improving the mind and conver&s;ing with re|fined and civilized people only, that we are able to conquer illiberal prejudices. From an impul&s;e of benevolence, for it could proceed from no other motive, &s;ince they had not received the &s;malle&s;t favour from me, they in a &s;hort time con|tracted &s;o warm a friend&s;hip for me, that had I been their neare&s;t relation, they could not have &s;hewn it in a &s;tronger manner than I experienced.</P>
<P>They not only expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;tre&s;s at &s;eeing me in a country where I mu&s;t be continually &s;ub|ject to in&s;ult, and where the manner of living mu&s;t be &s;o very different from that to which they knew by their own experience I had been accu&s;|tomed,
<PB N="112" REF="027216_0120_0FD3E09913399D98">
but they al&s;o took me to their hou&s;es, in|troduced me to their wives, and de&s;ired them to take the &s;ame care of me as of their own fa|mily.</P>
<P>This was not all; they urged me to allow one of them to go into &s;ome other apartments, which they could obtain from the prince, and almo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon my accepting of theirs. To this friendly propo&s;al, however, I could not ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. Indeed I was in daily expectation of taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the apartments promi&s;ed me by the prince; and had it been otherwi&s;e I could never have intruded &s;o much upon their friend&s;hip as to have con&s;ented to this reque&s;t. They continually, however, obliged me to accept of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;ugar, and many other articles, which from their &s;car|city at Tarudant were very valuable. Of money they knew I was not in want, as I drew upon Mr. Hutchi&s;on's agent for that article; but of tho&s;e little rarities which they frequently &s;ent to the prince, I was always kindly compelled to take my &s;hare. Had the&s;e two e&s;timable per&s;ons received all the advantages of a liberal education, what an ornament would they have proved to &s;ociety, and of what exten&s;ive utility to their nation!</P>
<P>On returning home from one of my vi&s;its to the prince, and having pa&s;&s;ed the gate-way, which is very lofty, and leads to the town, I was &s;ur|prized at hearing a number of voices, from above calling out very loudly, "Tibib, Tibib!" (Doctor, doctor!)&mdash;On looking back I ob&s;erved Muley Omar, one of Sidi Mahomet's &s;ons, and half-brother to Muley Ab&s;ulem, &s;itting in great &s;tate on the centre of the wall over the gate-way, with a number of his attendants on each &s;ide of
<PB N="113" REF="027216_0121_0FD3E09BC914E7C8">
him. I immediately rode up to the prince, and found him a tolerably good looking young man, of about two-and-twenty. He was rather of a dark complexion, and his features were &s;trongly marked with good-nature. After the u&s;ual &s;alu|tation, and having an&s;wered his que&s;tion, whe|ther I approved of the hor&s;e his brother had given me, I took my leave; but could not po&s;&s;ibly conceive the rea&s;on why a per&s;on of his con&s;e|quence &s;hould be &s;eated in &s;o &s;trange a place. I had not ridden far before I ob&s;erved about an hundred Moors on hor&s;eback, who were upon the full gallop, and firing at each other in a &s;trange and irregular manner. I was now in|formed that this was a &s;ham fight, performed for the amu&s;ement of the prince, who had cho&s;en the top of the gate-way for his place of ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>As I found it an ea&s;ier matter to keep my mind employed in the day-time than in the evening, I accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to go to bed, as well as to ri&s;e, very early. One evening I had not retired to re&s;t more than three hours, when I was alarmed by a noi&s;e which I at fir&s;t imagined was occa|&s;ioned by thieves getting into the hou&s;e. There had been lately a great number of robberies at Tarudant committed by the Arabs, who, as the hou&s;es in general were con&s;tructed of nothing but mud, had a cu&s;tom of making a hole in the wall large enough to admit them&s;elves through, with|out occa&s;ioning the lea&s;t alarm to any of the fa|mily. This I conceived to be the ca&s;e, and &s;up|po&s;ed that the noi&s;e I heard aro&s;e from the acci|dental falling down of part of the wall.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="027216_0122_0FD3E09CE017FCF8">I immediately got up and flew to the door, which was already opened by my interpreter, who had ri&s;en before me, and there I ob&s;erved the whole of my neighbours with lights in their hands, and in their &s;hirts and &s;hifts, in a perfect &s;tate of con&s;ternation. They were &s;tanding as if totally uncon&s;cious where they were, and without the power of &s;peech. Indeed the alarm had oc|ca&s;ioned the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions in them that it had in me, and they had ju&s;t advanced as far as the &s;pot where I fir&s;t &s;aw them, without having the re&s;olution to examine any further into the cau&s;e of the noi&s;e.</P>
<P>My interpreter, though but little better than the others, had &s;ummoned up courage enough to approach the &s;pot whence the noi&s;e aro&s;e; he there found that one fourth of the hou&s;e, which was built in a &s;quare, with a court in the centre, had entirely fallen down, and buried in its ruins two Jews, who were &s;leeping in the fallen apart|ment. I immediately a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and we &s;oon brought the two men into my room, where I examined them very particularly, and found them &s;peech|le&s;s&mdash;but &s;peechle&s;s only from fright. I mu&s;t confe&s;s this accident, which had occa&s;ioned a crack in my apartment increa&s;ed my anxiety to change it, as it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how &s;oon I might be in the &s;ame predicament with the two Jews whom I and my interpreter had extricated from the ruins; but notwith&s;tanding all my im|portunities, I could not per&s;uade the prince's ma|&s;ons to work fa&s;t enough to prove of any utility.</P>
<P>Among the many inconveniences which I ex|perienced at Tarudant, were the frequent in&s;ults I
<PB N="115" REF="027216_0123_0FD3E0A04223B6D8">
received in the &s;treets, for which I could certainly have received redre&s;s, but the number of new faces which were daily appearing, made applica|tions for it entirely u&s;ele&s;s. One day in my way to the prince, I was in&s;ulted by an ill-looking Moor, who, under the &s;anction of a Sharif<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sharifs are men who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be the de&s;cendants of Mahomet, and on that account are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in great e&s;teem.</NOTE>, thought him&s;elf ju&s;tified in &s;o doing; and there|fore in a very rude manner, ran his mule directly upon me, with an intention of either giving me a &s;evere blow, or of frighting my hor&s;e. I imme|diately expo&s;tulated with him upon the impro|priety of &s;uch brutal behaviour; upon which he told me I might go to the devil, for he was a Sharif. Upon this I found it nece&s;&s;ary to explain to him that I was &s;urgeon to his prince, who from being governor of the province, and having me under his immediate protection, would pay very little attention to his being a Sharif, but would puni&s;h him as his conduct merited; that I was then going to his highne&s;s, and as I was well ac|quainted with his name, &s;hould make my com|plaint of him. With a meanne&s;s proportioned to his pride, this haughty Sharif turned back his mule, and offered any atonement I could point out, even that of going down upon his knees, if I would forgive this offence, for he dreaded the idea of his in&s;olence being made known to the prince. I immediately con&s;ented to accept his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, but admoni&s;hed him, though a Sharif, to be cautious in future how he committed &s;uch a breach of ho&s;pitality as to in&s;ult a &s;tranger.</P>

<P>At the expiration of five weeks, during which time the prince expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect &s;atis|faction at the relief which I afforded him, an or|der came down from the emperor, commanding my immediate pre&s;ence at Morocco.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 30th of November, between &s;even and eight in the morning, I took my leave of the prince, having previou&s;ly intreated him to conti|nue his cour&s;e of medicines, and left Tarudant, under the charge of an Alcaide, and two &s;oldiers of the Negro cavalry, who carried up the annual pre&s;ent from the prince to the emperor, of &s;ix hor&s;es and three boxes of money. The&s;e, with my interpreter, a Jew, who &s;erved both as cook and groom, and a muleteer, who had the charge of my baggage, were my party for the journey.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one at noon we arrived at the foot of Mount Atlas, about twenty miles from Tarudant, where we pitched a very elegant tent, which the prince had procured for me, adjoining to &s;ome Moori&s;h huts. We found the country in our way hither a woody and uncultivated plain.</P>
<P>On the following day at &s;ix in the morning we &s;truck the tent, and immediately began to a&s;cend Mount Atlas. For near four hours we had one continued, difficult, and fatiguing a&s;cent, owing to the road being narrow, rocky, and &s;teep. From its abrupt and angular turnings the Moors di&s;tingui&s;h it by an Arabic name, which &s;ignifies the camel's neck.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="027216_0128_0FD3E0A8123BBD68">In many places and particularly on the higher parts of the mountain, be&s;ides the inconvenience of a rocky road which was only broad enough to allow one mule with difficulty to pa&s;s, we had a tremendous perpendicular precipice on one &s;ide, and even in &s;ome places, where the mountain con&s;i&s;ted only of a narrow ridge of rock, on both. It was a&s;toni&s;hing to ob&s;erve with what ea&s;e and &s;afety our mules a&s;cended and de&s;cend|ed the rough and uneven paths over the moun|tains without putting us to the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|mounting. By two in the afternoon we began to de&s;cend, and arrived at a &s;mall village, in the centre of which we pitched the tent.</P>
<P>On the following morning, at a little before &s;ix, we proceeded on our journey, and at five in the evening arrived at the termination of the mountains, where we &s;lept that night. The fir&s;t part of this day's journey was a de&s;cent on a mo&s;t dreadfully &s;teep and rocky road, which at la&s;t brought us into a beautiful vale, between two very high mountains, which immediately opens into the plains of Morocco, in a manner that is truly picture&s;que and &s;ublime.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it would have gratified me to have prolonged my &s;tay for a little while in the&s;e moun|tains, &s;o fertile in objects intere&s;ting to curio&s;ity. The few ob&s;ervations which I was able to collect in my pa&s;&s;age over them I &s;hall, however, pre&s;ent to my readers, without any further apology.</P>
<P>The Atlas are a chain of high mountains, in|ter&s;ected with deep vallies, which extend from the Ea&s;tern to the We&s;tern parts of Barbary, di|viding it into two parts or &s;ections. Tho&s;e to the
<PB N="121" REF="027216_0129_0FD3E0AF44A49558">
We&s;tward, from their height, are named the Greater Atlas, and tho&s;e to the Ea&s;tward the Le&s;&s;er. So immen&s;e is the height of the&s;e moun|tains, and particularly of tho&s;e in the neighbour|hood of Morocco, that though &s;o far to the Southward, their &s;ummits are perpetually covered with &s;now. When Muley Ab&s;ulem, the follow|ing January, pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ame track which I had pa&s;&s;ed in December, it &s;nowed the whole way; and from Morocco we at that time could not di&s;cover any part of the mountains which was not completely white.</P>
<P>The atmo&s;phere near their &s;ummits is inten&s;ely cold, to a degree indeed which is frequently found to be de&s;tructive to animal life. I was well in|formed that &s;ome Brebes, who had attempted to a&s;cend the highe&s;t part of the mountain, died im|mediately on the &s;pot, while others who were engaged in the &s;ame attempt were obliged to re|turn with the utmo&s;t precipitancy.</P>
<P>As December was not the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea|&s;on for botanical re&s;earches, I &s;aw little vegeta|tion on the mountains, except the agra-tree, on which I have already made &s;ome remarks when &s;peaking of the natural productions of the coun|try in general; but I am informed from the be&s;t authority, that in the &s;pring the&s;e mountains abound with an innumerable variety of curious plants. Indeed I have great rea&s;on to believe the natural philo&s;opher would find a nobler &s;cope in this country for his enquiries than in almo&s;t any part of the globe; and that the knowledge of medicine, as well as of botany, would be im|proved by a philo&s;ophical tour over the Atlas.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="027216_0130_0FD3E0B0727ADDE8">In the interior parts of the mountans there are, as I have before ob&s;erved, numerous iron-mines, and the Moors have an opinion that there are gold ones al&s;o; but the truth of this has not been a&s;|certained. I was informed of &s;everal volcanoes which exi&s;ted in different parts, but as I did not &s;ee them, I only give this as a mere report; though from the nature of things I cannot help repeating, that I think it highly probable many curious and valuable articles are concealed in the bowels of the&s;e unknown mountains, which indolence and want of emulation, &s;o &s;trongly interwoven in the di&s;po&s;ition and character of the Moors, will not &s;uffer them to explore.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to animal productions, Mount Atlas abounds with lions, tigers, wolves, wild boars, and mon&s;trous &s;erpents. But except when the nece&s;&s;ity produced by an extremely &s;evere winter drives the animals into the&s;e vales or tracks of men, they generally confine them&s;elves to the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the mountains. This remark, however, is not to be under&s;tood without exceptions; for when I was at Tarudant a ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was killed quite clo&s;e to the town; and there have been many in&s;tances of their ranging far beyond limits of the Mountains. The means made u&s;e of by the inhabitants to &s;ecure them&s;elves from their attacks at night are, by making large and numerous wood-fires, which the wild bea&s;ts &s;el|dom venture to approach. When I pa&s;&s;ed over the mountains, I met with no animals of prey, except &s;ome remarkably large eagles.</P>
<P>On the upper parts, in &s;ome places, there was nothing to be &s;een but an huge ma&s;s of barren

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> however, pre&s;ented us with a very different &s;cene. Here we ob&s;erved numerous vil|lages, gardens, and inclo&s;ures, which, though in December, were beautifully covered with verdure, and filed with fruit-trees of every de&s;cription. Corn grew at this &s;ea&s;on in the greate&s;t abundance, intermixed with plantations of olives and oranges, and &s;erved as the re&s;ort of a variety of &s;inging birds of every de&s;cription. In &s;ome places &s;mall ca&s;cades of water i&s;&s;ued from the rocks and moun|tains above, uniting and forming one continued &s;tream, which plentifully watered the plain. In fact, this &s;cene afforded the mo&s;t plea&s;ing relief to the mind, after the fatigues and dangers we had experienced in the higher parts of the mountains.</P>
<P>The villages con&s;i&s;ted of huts, rudely con|&s;tructed of earth and mud, and walled in. They are very numerous, and are inhabited by a &s;et of people who are named Brebes. The&s;e people dif|fer entirely from the Arabs and Moors. They are the original inhabitants of the country, who at the time of the conque&s;t by the Arabs fled into the&s;e mountains, where they have ever &s;ince con|tinued, and in a great mea&s;ure maintained their independence. Each village is under the direction of a Shaik, who, contrary to to the practice in the
<PB N="124" REF="027216_0132_0FD3E0B4107F86A8">
encampments of the Arabs, is an officer of their own choice.</P>
<P>The Brebes are a very athletic and &s;trong-fea|tured people, patient, and accu&s;tomed to hard|&s;hips and fatigue, and &s;eldom remove far from the &s;pot where they re&s;ide. They &s;have the fore part of the head, but &s;uffer their hair to grow from the crown as far behind as the neck. They wear no &s;hirt or drawers; they are only covered by one woollen garment without &s;leeves, and belted round the middle, though I have &s;een &s;ome few cover it with the haick. Their principal amu&s;e|ment is in the u&s;e of their mu&s;kets; they are in|deed excellent mark&s;men, and are very dexterous in twirling their mu&s;kets round, throwing them very high in the air, and afterwards catching them. So attached are they to the&s;e in&s;truments, that they frequently go to the expence of &s;ixty or even eighty ducats, to ornament them with &s;ilver and ivory.</P>
<P>Their employment con&s;i&s;ts principally in cul|tivating the vallies, looking after their cattle, and hunting wild bea&s;ts, the &s;kins of which become a very valuable article for &s;ale. Like the Arabs they have their regular markets for the di&s;po&s;al of cattle, &amp;c. where they either receive money or &s;ome other article in exchange. They have fallen, in a great mea&s;ure, into the cu&s;toms and religion of the Moors, but they &s;till retain their original language; and a Moor is frequently obliged to u&s;e an interpreter to enable him to conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ide in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s in the vallies, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there are al&s;o others who
<PB N="125" REF="027216_0133_0FD3E0B975BF5E70">
live in caves in the upper parts of the mountains; &s;o that the number of the whole mu&s;t be very con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>From their &s;ecure &s;ituation, the Brebes, although inhabiting a con&s;iderable tract within the bounds of the empire, have frequently proved very trouble|&s;ome to the Moori&s;h monarchs, &s;ometimes paying them tribute, and at others refu&s;ing it, according to the dictates of their inclination. It is not long &s;ince a general revolt took place among the Brebes, which obliged the emperor to &s;end a large army to &s;ubdue them; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">eeded no farther than to oblige them to di&s;per&s;e, with|out either conquering them, or gaining the point at which he aimed, which was to compel them to the payment of the tribute he demanded. The &s;ituation indeed of the&s;e mountains does not admit of the operations of a large army; for the moun|taineers, accu&s;tomed to climb up into the almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible rece&s;&s;es, &s;oon get beyond the reach of enemies who never before had made the at|tempt.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Brebes, many Jews re&s;ide in the vallies, and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;eparate habitations or villages. The&s;e people are employed in the trifling mecha|nical occupations which the Brebes require. In|deed I believe, there is no part of the world where the Jews are &s;o completely diffu&s;ed over the face of the country, or where they are &s;o &s;everely op|pre&s;&s;ed, as in Barbary.</P>
<P>In one of the places where I &s;lept in the&s;e val|lies, &s;oon after I got under my tent, I was amu&s;ed with the &s;ound of an in&s;trument very much re|&s;embling the bagpipe, and producing a wild and
<PB N="126" REF="027216_0134_0FD3E0BBDF7E2628">
melancholy &s;train. Curious to know the nature of the in&s;trument, I &s;ent for the per&s;on who was playing upon it, and immediately purcha&s;ed it. It proved to be made of a common cane, about eight inches in length, perfectly hollow, without any cork or &s;top to it, with &s;ix holes before, and one behind for the thumb, between which was a narrow bra&s;s plate by way of ornament; it had a common cord fixed to it, for the purpo&s;e of hanging it round the neck. It in fact altogether &s;o well corre&s;ponded with the de&s;cription of the pipe which was u&s;ed by the antient &s;hepherds, that I have little doubt of this de&s;cription reviving a few cla&s;&s;ical and romantic ideas in the minds of &s;ome readers.</P>
<P>It is by no means a very ea&s;y matter to de&s;cribe the different &s;en&s;ations which are experienced in pa&s;&s;ing over the&s;e wonderful mountains. Their immen&s;e height, the dangerous precipices, the vales, which form their depth appeared like &s;o many aby<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, in&s;pired altogether an emotion of awe and terror, which may be better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed. On the other hand, the unlimited and great variety of pro&s;pects di&s;coverable from their &s;umm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, the numerous herd of goats and &s;heep which were &s;crambling over the almo&s;t per|pendicular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and the univer&s;al barrenne&s;s of the mountain, contra&s;ted with the beautiful ver|dure of the vallies immediately below, formed on the whole a &s;cene &s;ufficiently beautiful and pic|ture&s;que, to counterbalance the inconveniences we otherwi&s;e &s;uffered.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the 3d of December, between five and &s;ix in the morning, we proceeded on our jour|ney, and &s;oon reached a fine plain, on which we continued the whole way to Morocco, where we arrived on the following day about noon, having performed altogether a journey of about one hun|dred and twenty-five miles.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t object on my arrival was to &s;ecure my|&s;elf a convenient place of re&s;idence in the Jewdry; and having accompli&s;hed that to my &s;atisfaction, I immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, expecting anxi|ou&s;ly every hour to be &s;ummoned before the em|peror. Though, however, his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty was, repeatedly informed of my arrival, yet to my great a&s;toni&s;hment I continued a whole month in a &s;tate of uncertainty and expectation, without having it in my power to obtain an audience, or to be informed of the cau&s;e which removed me from Tarudant.</P>
<P>The number of anecdotes in circulation through the town to my prejudice, excited in me continual unea&s;ine&s;s, which even increa&s;ed in proportion to
<PB N="128" REF="027216_0136_0FD3E0BF4FAC6F98">
the length of time that had elap&s;ed &s;ince my ar|rival. By one of the emperors confidential friends it was in&s;inuated to me, that his imperial maje&s;ty had heard I was young; that I was admini&s;tering internal medicines for di&s;ea&s;es of the eye, which was a practice totally new and unaccountable to them; that European medicines were always pow|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul and violent, and that if I had been &s;uffered to attend the prince much longer, his con&s;titution would have been ruined for ever. Another even went &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the emperor &s;u&s;pected me of having been employed by my countrymen with a view to poi&s;on his &s;on.</P>
<P>After much perplexing inve&s;tigation into the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, I now di&s;covered that my journey to Tarudant was a private affair, &s;ettled between the con&s;ul and the prince; that the em|peror, who at that time was not upon the be&s;t terms with the Engli&s;h court, and who had already &s;topped all communication between his dominions and the garri&s;on of Gibraltar, was highly di&s;plea&s;ed that an Engli&s;hman &s;hould be introduced, unknown to him, for the purpo&s;e of attending his &s;on in a medical capacity; that his Moori&s;h phy&s;ician, out of pique, had per&s;uaded the emperor, that Eu|ropean medicines were too potent for the prince's con&s;titution, and that in reality his &s;on was in ex|treme danger while under my care;&mdash;that in fine, all the&s;e arguments weighed &s;o powerfully with the emperor, that he not only determined on im|mediately removing me from the prince, but at the &s;ame time ordered &s;ome of my medicines to be privately &s;ent up to Morocco, where they were to undergo a &s;trict examination by his phy|&s;ician.
<PB N="129" REF="027216_0137_0FD3E0C1099FE5D0">
The cau&s;e of my not being honoured with an audience, I found to ari&s;e from a de&s;ire in the emperor, to be thoroughly informed of the &s;tate of the prince's health before he &s;aw me, that ac|cording to circum&s;tances he might give me a favourable or a cool reception.</P>
<P>As &s;ome alleviation to the unea&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ion|ed by this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, I was now much more comfortably &s;ituated than I had been before at Tarudant. The apartment which I had pro|cured was one &s;tory high, in the hou&s;e of a very re&s;pectable family, and was &s;pacious, clean, and retired. From a Genoe&s;e gentleman in the &s;er|vice of the emperor, I was enabled to procure a table, two chairs, two di&s;hes, a few plates, &s;ome knives and forks, and a couple of tumblers. In addition to this, a Jew offered his &s;ervices as cook, who had lived &s;ome time with an European, and who proved an adroit and u&s;eful per&s;on. Provi&s;ions of every kind were remarkably plentiful, good, and cheap. For beef and mutton I paid only about two pence Engli&s;h a pound, for fine fowls about &s;ix pence each, and pigeons were frequently &s;old at the rate of three halfpence a pair. Had I, in addition to all the&s;e comforts, been able to have procured a little agreeable &s;ociety, my &s;ituation would have been very &s;upportable; but in that particular I &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more advantages than I had during my re&s;idence at Tarudant.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e gentleman, from who&s;e hou&s;e I had borrowed a part of my furniture, was at Mogodore, and the only Europeans who were at that time at Morocco, if we except a few

Spani&s;h artificers in the emperor's &s;ervice, were part of the English &s;eamen who had been &s;hip|wrecked, a French officer, with &s;ome French &s;ea|men, who were al&s;o captives from a &s;imilar ac|cident, and three Spani&s;h friars. Out of the&s;e I could only chu&s;e for my &s;ociety the French officer and the friars.</P>
<P>With the fir&s;t, as I was acquainted with the French language, I could conver&s;e pretty fluently, and I really found him a mo&s;t agreeable companion: he had taken this pa&s;&s;age on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for the French &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guinea, whether he was proceeding to join his regiment, and was &s;hipwrecked on that part of the coa&s;t of Africa which lies in the direction of the Canary I&s;lands. This misfortune, united to the hard&s;hips which followed it on his being carried into &s;lavery by the wild Arabs, and the little pro&s;pect which then appeared of his redemption, had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon his &s;pirits, and &s;ubjected him to occa&s;ional attacks of hypochondria. The em|peror, it is true, could not be accu&s;ed of ill treating any of the captives; on the contrary, he allowed them daily a &s;mall &s;um of money, and permitted them to walk about at liberty. His detention of them, however, in the country, without any im|mediate pro&s;pect of returning home, was a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for them &s;till to con&s;ider them&s;elves in no other light than that of &s;laves.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h friars, who have a &s;mall convent in the Jewdry, and who were originally placed there for the purpo&s;e of redeeming captives, as they di&s;tributed medicines to the poor gratis, con|&s;idered them&s;elves as being engaged in the &s;ame
<PB N="131" REF="027216_0139_0FD3E0C4C1B3F190">
profe&s;&s;ion with my&s;elf, and received me very ho&s;|pitably; but as, from my not under&s;tanding their language, I was obliged to conver&s;e with them by means of my interpreter, who &s;poke Spani&s;h, the &s;ociety enjoyed with them was very limited in|deed. I cannot avoid expre&s;&s;ing my concern for the fate of the&s;e worthy men, who are di&s;tined to &s;pend the whole of their lives on a &s;pot de&s;titute of all civilized &s;ociety, where they are continually &s;ubjected to the caprice and in&s;olence of the em|peror, as well as of the wor&s;t part of his &s;ubjects. They appeared to me to be men who had received much information from reading, as well as from ob&s;ervation, and they very properly employed their times in the duties of their profe&s;&s;ion, in the offices of devotion, and admini&s;tering medicines to the poor, in &s;tudy, and in &s;uch innocent re|creations as the limited &s;ociety of Morocco af|fords.</P>
<P>To divert my thoughts from the great unea&s;ine&s;s which my &s;ituation naturally in&s;pired, during &s;o long a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, I made daily excur&s;ions through different parts of Morocco; though, from the continual in&s;ults which I experienced when in the &s;treets, even this amu&s;ement was attended with con&s;iderable inconvenience.</P>
<P>The city of Morocco; which lies about one hundred and twenty miles to the North of Taru|dant, ninety to the ea&s;t of Mogodore, and three hundred and fifty to the South of Tangier, is &s;ituated in a beautiful valley, formed by a chain of mountains on the Northern &s;ide, and tho&s;e of the Atlas, from which it is di&s;tant about twenty miles, on the South and Ea&s;t. The country which
<PB N="132" REF="027216_0140_0FD3E0C671F93A68">
immediately &s;urrounds it is a fertile plain, beauti|fully diver&s;ified with clumps of palm trees and &s;hrubs, and watered by &s;mall and numerous &s;treams, which de&s;cend from Mount Atlas. The emperor's out-gardens, which are &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of about five miles to the South of the city, and are large plantations of olives walled in, add con&s;iderably to the beauty of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Morocco, though one of the capitals of the empire&mdash;for there are three, Morocco, Mequinez, and Fez&mdash;has nothing to recommend it but its great extent, and the royal palace. It is inclo&s;ed by remarkably &s;trong walls, built of tabby, the circumference of which is about eight miles. On the&s;e walls there are no guns mounted, but they are flanked with &s;quare towers, and &s;ur|rounded by a wide and deep ditch. The city has a number of entrances, con&s;i&s;ting of large double porches of tabby, in the Gothic &s;tyle, the gates of which are regularly &s;hut every night at certain hours. As polygamy is allowed by the Maho|metan religion, and is &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;ome degree to affect population, it would be difficult to form any computation near the truth with re&s;pect to the number of inhabitants which this city may contain.</P>
<P>The mo&s;ques, which are the only public build|ings except the palace, worth noticing at Moroc|co, are more numerous than magnificent; one of them is ornamented with a very high and &s;quare tower, built of cut &s;tone, which is vi&s;ible at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the city.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are very narrow, dirty, and irregu|lar, and many of the hou&s;es are uninhabited, and
<PB N="133" REF="027216_0141_0FD3E0C7A4C44AE0">
falling to ruin. Tho&s;e which are decent and re&s;pectable in their appearance are built of tabby, and enclo&s;ed in gardens. That of the Effendi, or prime mini&s;ter, was among the be&s;t which I vi&s;ited in Morocco. This hou&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ted of two &s;tories, had elegant apartments both above and below, furni&s;hed in a &s;tile far &s;uperior to any thing I ever &s;aw in that country. The court, into which the lower apartments opened, was very neatly paved with glazed blue and white tiling, and had in its centre a beautiful fountain. The upper apartments were connected together. by a broad gallery, the ballu&s;tres of which were painted of different colours. The hot and cold baths were very large, and had every convenience which art could afford. Into the garden, which was laid out in a tolerably neat &s;tile, opened a room adjoining to the hou&s;e, which had a broad arched entrance, but no door, beautifully orna|mented with checquered tiling; and at both ends of the apartment the walls were entirely covered with looking-gla&s;s. The flooring of all the rooms was covered with beautiful carpeting, the walls ornamented with large and valuable looking-gla&s;&s;es, intermixed with watches and clocks in gla&s;s ca&s;es. The ceiling was carved wood-work, painted of different colours, and the whole was in a &s;uperior &s;tile of Moori&s;h grandeur. This and a few others are the only decent habitations in Morocco. The generality of them &s;erve only to impre&s;s the traveller with the idea of a mi&s;er|able and de&s;erted city.</P>
<P>The Elcai&s;&s;eria is a particular part of the town where &s;tuffs and other valuable articles are ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="027216_0142_0FD3E0C9187DF178">
to &s;ale. It con&s;i&s;ts of a number of &s;mall &s;hops, formed in the walls of the hou&s;es, about a yard from the ground, of &s;uch a height within as ju&s;t to admit a man to &s;it in one of them cro&s;s-legged. The goods and drawers are &s;o arranged round him, that when he &s;erves his cu&s;tomers, who are &s;tanding all the time out in the &s;treet, he can reach down any article he wants, without being under the nece&s;&s;ity of moving. The&s;e &s;hops, which are found in all the other towns of the empire, are &s;ufficient to afford a &s;triking example of the indolence of the Moors.</P>
<P>There are three daily markets in different parts of the town at Morocco, where provi&s;ions are &s;old, and two weekly fairs or markets for the di&s;|posal of cattle, where the &s;ame cu&s;tom is ob&s;erved as at Tarudant.</P>
<P>The city is &s;upplied with water by means of wooden pipes connected with the neighbouring &s;treams, which empty them&s;elves into re&s;ervoirs placed for the purpo&s;e in the &s;uburbs, and &s;ome few in the centre of the town.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle is a large and ruinous building, the outer walls of which enclo&s;e a &s;pace of ground about three miles in circumference. It has a mo&s;que built by Muley Abdallah, father to Sidi Mahomet, on the top of which are three large balls; the&s;e, the Moors allege, are formed of &s;olid gold, but as no per&s;on is permitted to a&s;cend to them, we mu&s;t tru&s;t to their word for the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. The ca&s;tle is almo&s;t a town of it&s;elf; it contains a number of inhabitants, who in &s;ome department or other are in the &s;ervice of the emperor, and all under the direction of a par|ticular
<PB N="135" REF="027216_0143_0FD3E0CBA4886EA8">
Alcaide, who is quite independent of the governor of the town.</P>
<P>On the out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle, between the Moori&s;h town and the Jewdry, are &s;everal &s;mall, di&s;tinct pavilions, enclo&s;ed in gardens of orange-trees, which are intended as occa&s;ional places of re&s;idence for &s;uch of the emperor's &s;ons or bro|thers as happen to be at Morocco. As they are covered with coloured tiling, they have at a &s;mall di&s;tance rather a neat appearance, but upon ap|proaching or entering them, that effect in a great mea&s;ure cea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that in the imme|diate vicinity of Morocco, for &s;ome di&s;tance round the city, the ground is totally occupied by a great number of rats, of a larger &s;pecies than any I had ever before &s;een, which burrow under ground, and like rabbits, allow &s;trangers to approach very near before they retire to their holes. They indeed gave me every idea of a rabbit-warren in miniature.</P>
<P>The Jews, who are at this place pretty numer|ous, have a &s;eparate town to them&s;elves, walled in, and under the charge of an Alcaide, appointed by the emperor. It has two large gates, which are regularly &s;hut every evening about nine o'clock, after which time no per&s;on whatever is permitted to enter or go out of the Jewdry, till they are opened again the following morning. The Jews have a market of their own, and, as at Tarudant, when they enter the Moori&s;h town, ca&s;tle, or palace, they are always compelled to be bare|footed.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="027216_0144_0FD3E0CCCD23C8E8">The Jews in general are obliged to pay to the emperor a certain annual income, in proportion to their numbers, which is a con&s;iderable income, in|dependent of his arbitrary exactions. Tho&s;e of Mo|rocco were exempted by Sidi Mahomet from this tax, and in its room he compelled them to take goods of him, of which they were to di&s;po&s;e in the be&s;t manner they could, and pay him five times their value; by which means they were far greater &s;ufferers than if they paid the annual tax.</P>
<P>Every part of the empire more or le&s;t abounds with Jews, who orignally were expelled from Spain and Portugal and who fled into Barbary as a place of refuge. The&s;e people are not confined to towns but are &s;pread over the whole face of the country, Mount Atlas it&s;elf, as was before mentioned, not excepted.</P>
<P>In every country where they re&s;ide, the&s;e un|fortunate people are treated as another cla&s;s of beings; but in no part of the world are they &s;o &s;everely and unde&s;ervedly oppre&s;&s;ed as in Barbary, where the whole country depends upon their in|du&s;try and ingenuity, and could &s;carcely &s;ub&s;i&s;t as a nation without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They are the only mechanics in this part of the world, and have the whole management of all pecuniary and commercial matters, except the collecting of the cu&s;toms. They are, however, intru&s;ted in the coinage of money, as I my&s;elf have witne&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doubloons and hard dollars are current in this country: but the coins peculiar to it are, gold <HI>ducats,</HI> of the value of ten hard dollars, &s;ome of five, of one and a half, and others of only one; ounces, of the value of about five pence En|gli&s;h; and blanquils, of five farthings, both &s;ilver coins; fluces, which are of copper, twenty-four being equal to a blanquil; but ounces are the money in which bills are u&s;ually drawn in the country. All the emperor's coins have his name in Arabic &s;tamped on one &s;ide, and on the other the date, and place at which they were coined.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="027216_0145_0FD3E0D106000A90">The Moors di&s;play more humanity to their bea&s;ts than to the Jews. I have &s;een frequent in&s;tances where individuals of this unhappy people were beaten &s;o &s;everely, as to be left almo&s;t life|le&s;s on the ground, and that without being able to obtain the lea&s;t redre&s;s whatever, as the ma|gi&s;trates always act with the mo&s;t culpable par|tiality when a Moor and a Jew are the parties in a &s;uit. What they lo&s;e by oppre&s;&s;ion, however, they in a great mea&s;ure make up by their &s;uperior addre&s;s and &s;agacity, which frequently enables them to over-reach the Moors&mdash;as I cannot com|pliment the Jews of Barbary in general upon their probity and principle.</P>
<P>Jacob Attal, the emperor's Jewi&s;h and favour|ite &s;ecretary, had more influence with his royal ma&s;ter, and did more mi&s;chief by his intrigues and addre&s;s, than all the other mini&s;ters put to|gether. This young man who was a native of Tunis, and who was tolerably well acquainted with the Engli&s;h, Spani&s;h, Italian, French, and Arabic languages, was of an active and enterpriz|ing mind, and had &s;o well informed him&s;elf of the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the Moors, and particu|larly of that of Sidi Mahomet, that he had gained an entire a&s;cendency over the emperor. As he knew that an unbounded love of money was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his royal ma&s;ter, he not only
<PB N="138" REF="027216_0146_0FD3E0D2DD8743E0">
&s;urrendered to him half of his own gains, but al&s;o furni&s;hed the emperor with the earlie&s;t and be&s;t information concerning tho&s;e who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, as well as with a project for extracting it from them. By thus attacking the emperor on the weake&s;t &s;ide, he &s;ecured his friend&s;hip; but he &s;ecured it by means which ex|po&s;ed him to the re&s;entment and revenge of thou|&s;ands as &s;oon as the emperor died, which has been &s;ince too fatally proved. I mu&s;t, however, do this young man the ju&s;tice to add, that throughout the whole of his admini&s;tration, though in &s;ome in&s;tances perhaps, contrary to his own intere&s;t he &s;hewed an exclu&s;ive preference to the Engli&s;h; and of this the Moors in general were &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that they gave him the appellation of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>The Jews in mo&s;t parts of this empire live en-entirely &s;eparate from the Moors; and though in other re&s;pects oppre&s;&s;ed, are allowed the free exerci&s;e of their religion. Many of them, how|ever, to avoid the arbitrary treatment which they con&s;tantly experience, have become converts to the Mahometan faith; upon which they are ad|mitted to all the privileges of Moors, though they lo&s;e their real e&s;timation in the opinion of both &s;ects.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the &s;ea-port towns, and particularly at Tetuan and Tangier, the Jews have a tolerable &s;mattering of Spani&s;h; but at Morocco, Taru|dant, and all the inland towns, they can only &s;peak Arabic and a little Hebrew. They nearly follow the cu&s;toms of the Moors, except in their religious ceremonies; and in that particular they
<PB N="139" REF="027216_0147_0FD3E0D44F35EFA8">
are by far more &s;uper&s;titious than the European Jews.</P>
<P>The Jews of Barbary &s;have their heads clo&s;e, and wear their beards long; their dre&s;s indeed, altogether, differs very little from that of the Moors (which I &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe) except in their being obliged to appear externally in black. For which purpo&s;e they wear a black cap, black &s;lippers, and in&s;tead of the haick worn by the Moors, &s;ub&s;titute the Alberoce, a cloak made of black wool, which covers the whole of the under dre&s;s. The Jews are not permitted to go out of the country, but by an expre&s;s order from the emperor; nor are they allowed to wear a &s;word, or ride a hor&s;e, though they are indulged in the u&s;e of mules. This ari&s;es from an opinion pre|valent among the Moors, that the hor&s;e is too noble an animal to be employed in the &s;ervice of &s;uch infidels as Jews.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Jewi&s;h women con&s;i&s;ts of a fine linen &s;hirt with large and loo&s;e &s;leeves, which hang almo&s;t to the ground; over the &s;hirt is worn a caftan, a loo&s;e dre&s;s made of woollen cloth, or velvet, of any colour reaching as low as the hips, and covering the whole of the body, except the neck and brea&s;t which are left open, and the edges of the Caftan as worn by the Jewe&s;&s;es of Morocco, are embroidered with gold. In addition to the&s;e is the Geraldito, or petticoats, made of fine green woollen cloth, the edges and corners of which are &s;ometimes embroidered with gold. They are fa&s;tened by a broad &s;a&s;h of &s;ilk and gold, which &s;urrounds the wai&s;t, and the ends of it are &s;uffered to hang down behind, in an ea&s;y manner.
<PB N="140" REF="027216_0148_0FD3E0D616F2A628">
This is the dre&s;&s; they wear in the hou&s;e, but when they go abroad, they throw over it the haick. The unmarried women wear their hair plaited in different folds, and hanging down be|hind. They have a very graceful and becoming method of putting a wreath of wrought &s;ilk round the head, and tying it behind in a bow. This dre&s;s &s;ets off their features to great advan|tage, and di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the married women, who cover their heads with a red &s;ilk handkerchief, which they tie behind, and over it put a &s;ilk &s;a&s;h leaving the ends to hang loo&s;e on their backs. None of the Jewi&s;h women u&s;e &s;tockings, but wear red &s;lippers, curiou&s;ly em|broidered with gold. They wear very large gold ear-rings, at the lower part of their ears, and at the upper three &s;mall ones &s;et with pearls or pre|cious &s;tones. Their necks are loaded with beads, and their fingers with &s;mall gold or &s;ilver rings. Round each wri&s;t and ankle they wear large &s;olid &s;ilver bracelets; and the rich have gold and silver chairs &s;u&s;pended from the &s;a&s;h behind.</P>
<P>Their marriages are celebrated with much fe&s;|tivity for &s;ome time previous to the ceremony, and the intended bride with all her female relations, go through the form of having their faces painted red and white, and their hands and feet &s;tained yellow, with an herb named henna. A variety of figures are marked out on them with a needle, and then this herb, which is powdered and mixed with water into a pa&s;te, is worked into the holes made by the needle, and the&s;e marks continue on the hands and feet for a long &s;pace of time. Upon the death of a Jew (before and after burial) all

the female relations, with other women hired for the purpo&s;e, a&s;&s;emble in the room of the decea&s;ed, and for &s;everal days lament his lo&s;s by mo&s;t dreadful &s;hrieks and howlings, and tearing their cheeks and hair.</P>
<P>The Jewe&s;&s;es of this empire in general are very beautiful and remarkably fair.&mdash;They marry very young, and when married, though they are not obliged to hide their faces in the &s;treet, yet at home they are frequently treated with the &s;ame &s;everity as the Moori&s;h women. Like the Moors, the Jewi&s;h men and women at Morocco eat &s;epa|rate; and the unmarried women are not permitted to go out except on particular occa&s;ions, and then always with their faces covered.</P>
<P>A di&s;po&s;ition for intrigue in the female &s;ex is always found to accompany tyrannical conduct and undue re&s;traint on the part of ours; and this di&s;po&s;ition is again made the excu&s;e for the con|tinuance of the&s;e re&s;traints. Thus the effect be|comes a cau&s;e, and when the women cea&s;e to be the guardians of their, own honour, they derive no credit from the pre&s;ervation of it, and incur in their own e&s;timation but little di&s;grace by its lo&s;s. The Jews allege, in extenuation of their &s;e|verity, the licentious inclinations and artful di&s;po|&s;itions of their women, and that a &s;ingle act of criminality in a daughter would be an effectual bar to her ever forming a legal connection. The &s;ame objection not being &s;o applicable to their married women, they are permitted to go out without re&s;traint. Indeed many of their hu&s;bands, from intere&s;ted motives, are too apt to connive at a conduct, which, in other countries would in|fallibly

<P>The habitable part of the palace con&s;i&s;ts of &s;e|veral irregular &s;quare pavilions, built of tabby, and whitened over; &s;ome of which communicate with each other, others are di&s;tinct and mo&s;t of them receive their names from the different towns of the empire. The principal pavilion is named by the Moors the Douhar, and is more properly the palace or &s;eraglio than any of the others. It con&s;i&s;ts of the emperor's place of re&s;idence, and the Harem, forming altogether a building of con|&s;iderable extent. The other pavilions are merely for the purpo&s;es of plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, and are quite di&s;tinct from the Douhar.</P>
<P>The Mogodore pavilion, &s;o named from the emperor's partiality to that town, has by far the faire&s;t claim to grandeur and magnificence. This apartment was the work of Sidi Mahomet, and is lofty and &s;quare.

<P>The apartments of the emperor have in general a much &s;maller complement of furniture than tho&s;e of the Moors in the inferior walks of life. Hand&s;ome carpetting, a matra&s;s on the ground, covered with fine linen, a couch, and a couple of European bed&s;teads, are the principal articles they contain. The gardens within the walls of the palace, of which he has &s;everal, are very neat; they contain orange and olive trees, variou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y di&s;|po&s;ed and arranged, and inter&s;ected with &s;treams of water, fountains and re&s;ervoirs.

<P>In introducing the de&s;cription of the palace in this place, I have rather deviated from the chro|nological &s;eries of my narrative, as the events which brought me acquainted with this &s;acred re&s;idence of the Moori&s;h princes were po&s;terior to my vi&s;iting all the other quarters of the metro|polis.</P>

<P>AFTER the lap&s;e of a month without a pro&s;|pect of obtaining an audience, my anxiety was increa&s;ed to a degree which in the end proved extremely injurious to my health. From the at|tention which I had paid to mo&s;t of the emperor's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ters, who all of them in their turn had oc|ca&s;ion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay &s;ervices, I thought I had a right to expect &s;ome little return. With all that deceit which has characterized the inhabitants of Bar|bary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Punica &s;ides.</NOTE> from the earlie&s;t periods, they profe&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t friend&s;hip for me, and a&s;&s;ured me that they would exert their influence upon the empe|ror to per&s;uade him to &s;ee me. Among the num|ber was a Moor named Sidi Brahim, to whom
<PB N="145" REF="027216_0153_0FD3E0E050B77EC8">
the prince had given me &s;trong letters of recommen|dation, and who, during a tedious &s;ickne&s;s which had prevailed in his family, had received from me the mo&s;t con&s;tant attention. This Moor had directions from the prince to introduce me im|mediately upon my arrival to the emperor, and to &s;hew me every civility that was due to &s;uch recommendation. All the&s;e circum&s;tances I con|ceived gave me a &s;ufficient right to expect that Sidi Brahim, both from motives of duty to his prince, and gratitude to me, would have exerted him&s;elf in a manner corre&s;pondent to &s;uch obliga|tions. But that was far from being the ca&s;e. When his family was under my care, he certainly did receive me with attention, and treated me with kindne&s;s; but when my advice became no longer nece&s;&s;ary, his friend&s;hip cooled in propor|tion; and latterly, when we happened to meet, he &s;carcely &s;eemed to recollect me. Upon reflec|tion, what was I to expect from a man, who for his notorious crimes, though at that time in great favour, had been puni&s;hed by his &s;overeign, having had the greate&s;t part of his beard pulled up by the roots?</P>
<P>Un&s;ucce&s;sful nd di&s;appointed through this chan|nel, I had recour&s;e to &s;ome others of the emperor's attendants, on whom I had conferred favours, and who had perhaps &s;till greater influence with the emperor than even Sidi Brahim. Among this number were the prime mini&s;ter, and one of the emperor's principal talbs. From the&s;e officers I experienced, however, much the &s;ame treatment as from Sidi Brahim; and had I not accidentally been called in to attend the wife of one of the em|peror's
<PB N="146" REF="027216_0154_0FD3E0E1F4A81E28">
principal Jews, it is probable I might have continued in the &s;ame &s;ame &s;tate of anxious un|certainty for &s;ome weeks longer. As a return for my attendance, the hu&s;band of this patient, agreeably to my reque&s;t, had addre&s;s and influence enough to per&s;uade the emperor to appoint an audience for me the very day after the ap|plication.</P>
<P>On the day appointed for my reception at court, about twelve at noon, three negro &s;oldiers, with large clubs in their hands, came to my apart|ments to e&s;cort me to the palace; telling me, that they had directions to return with me in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, and that they mu&s;t an&s;wer it with their heads, if they delayed a moment in the exe|cution of their orders. Not &s;u&s;pecting that my Jewi&s;h friend, for &s;uch I mu&s;t certainly denomi|nate him, could have effected my wi&s;hes &s;o im|mediately, I was by no means prepared for the audience; and I reque&s;ted them to wait a few moments, till I could enable my&s;elf to appear in a decent dre&s;s before the emperor. Far, however, from acceding to my reque&s;t, the &s;oldiers became impatient, and acquainted me, that I mu&s;t either proceed with them immediately, or they would return and inform the &s;ultan, that I had refu&s;ed to comply with his orders. I now found my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting off, and we all ac|tually <HI>ran</HI> together to the palace with the utmo&s;t expedition. When we arrived there, I was intro|duced to one of the ma&s;ters of the audience, who de&s;ired me to wait on the out&s;ide of the palace till I was called for.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="027216_0155_0FD3E0E3593D9028">From the abrupt and &s;udden manner in which I was forced away by the &s;oldiers, I expected to be u&s;hered immediately into the imperial pre&s;ence; but &s;o far was I &s;till from the con&s;ummation of this expectation, that I remained on the &s;pot where they fir&s;t placed me, from twelve o'clock at noon till five in the evening, revolving in my mind, what kind of a per&s;on I &s;hould find the emperor, what reception I &s;hould meet with, and the an&s;wers which I ought to make to any que&s;tions he might propo&s;e. Situated as I was with re&s;pect to the prince whom I had been attending, and con&s;idering the malicious reports re&s;pecting my conduct which had been circulated about Morocco, the reader may well &s;uppo&s;e that I was led to form a variety of conjectures, concerning what was likely to be the re&s;ult of the audience. I however placed my whole confidence in the prince's re|covery, which was a circum&s;tance, when clearly known to the emperor, that mu&s;t undoubtedly operate in my favour. This idea at la&s;t entirely removed a number of unea&s;y and anxious reflec|tions, which had occured to me when I fir&s;t en|tered the palace; and by the time the me&s;&s;enger came to introduce me to the emperor I had brought my&s;elf to be as calm and recollected as if my mind had been perfectly at ea&s;e, and had no rea&s;on to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>From the court-yard into which I was fir&s;t in|troduced, I was hurried with the greate&s;t precipi|tancy through two or three others, till I arrived at the gate which opened to the court where the emperor was waiting to receive me. I was there
<PB N="148" REF="027216_0156_0FD3E0E5B56E11F0">
detained for &s;ome time by the ma&s;ter of the au|dience, owing to my refu&s;al of the pre&s;ent which Europeans are accu&s;tomed to make to the em|peror upon being honoured with an audience. I had been previou&s;ly acquainted that no per&s;on was ever permitted to appear in his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, unle&s;s accompanied by a hand&s;ome pre|&s;ent; but I conceived my &s;ituation to be in every re&s;pect &s;o totally different from that of other &s;trangers who vi&s;ited the court, that I told the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, if he per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing me entrance, I would immediately return home again.</P>
<P>The Moor, finding that I was determined not comply with his reque&s;t, and knowing that the emperor was purpo&s;ely waiting to &s;ee me, was afraid to defer my introduction any longer; I was therefore u&s;hered into his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence very expeditiou&s;ly, and directed to place my&s;elf and my interpreter in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be &s;een with|out approaching too near his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Moor who introduced me, upon appearing in &s;ight of the emperor, pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the earth, ki&s;&s;ed it, and in a very humble manner exclaimed in Arabic, "May God pre&s;erve the king!" The emperor then ordered him to ap|proach, and deliver what he had to &s;ay. He inform|ed his maje&s;ty, that in compliance with his order, he had brought before him the Engli&s;h doctor; after which, having made a very low bow, he retired, and the emperor immediately de&s;ired me and my interpreter to advance towards him; but as &s;oon as we had got within ten yards of the emperor,
<PB N="149" REF="027216_0157_0FD3E0E6B59B6B50">
two &s;oldiers came up, pulled us by the coat, and acquainted us that we mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to ap|proach any further.</P>
<P>I found the &s;overeign &s;eated in an European po&s;t-chai&s;e, placed in one of his open courts, and drawn by one mule in &s;hafts, having a man on each &s;ide to guide it. Behind the carriage were foot &s;oldiers, &s;ome Negroes and others Moors, in two divi&s;ions, forming together a half-moon. Some of the&s;e &s;oldiers were only armed with large clubs, while others had mu&s;kets which they held clo&s;e to their bodies, and pointed perpendicularly.</P>
<P>The emperor, after &s;urveying me minutely and with the greate&s;t attention, accompanied with no &s;mall &s;hare of <HI>hauteur,</HI> demanded from my in|terpreter, in a very &s;tern manner, if I was the Chri&s;tian doctor who had been attending Muley Ab&s;ulem? I de&s;ired him to an&s;wer, that I was.&mdash;<Q>How came you into the country; and were you &s;ent by order of your own king, or by whom?</Q> To render my vi&s;it of more importance, I an&s;wered, "By order of government."&mdash;<Q>Where did you learn your profe&s;&s;ion, and what is the name of the per&s;on who taught it you?</Q> I in|formed his maje&s;ty.&mdash;<Q>What is the rea&s;on that the French &s;urgeons are better than the Engli&s;h; and which do you think are be&s;t?" I an&s;wered, The French &s;urgeons are very good, but it mu&s;t certainly be allowed that the Engli&s;h are in general &s;uperior, being more &s;cientifically educated.</Q>&mdash;The emperor then ob&s;erved, that a French &s;urgeon had come into the country, and in the cour&s;e of his practice had killed &s;everal per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="027216_0158_0FD3E0E9D8908360">His maje&s;ty next a&s;ked, in a very au&s;tere man|ner, "What was the rea&s;on I had forbidden Muley Ab&s;ulem the u&s;e of tea?" My reply was, "Mu|ley Ab&s;ulem has very weak nerves, and tea is injurious to the nervous &s;y&s;tem."&mdash;"If tea is &s;o unwhole&s;ome," replied his maje&s;ty, "why do the Engli&s;h drink &s;o much?" I an&s;wered, "It is true, they drink it twice a day; but then they do not make it &s;o &s;trong as the Moors, and they generally u&s;e milk with it, which le&s;&s;ens its pernicious effects. But the Moors, when once they begin to u&s;e it, make it very &s;trong, drink a great deal, and very frequently with|out milk."&mdash;"You are right," &s;aid the emperor; and I know it &s;ometimes makes their hands &s;hake." After this conver&s;ation, about a dozen di&s;tilled waters, prepared from different herbs, were frought for me to ta&s;te, and inform the em|peror what they were; which were hot, and which were cold, &amp;c.</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty now conde&s;cended to become more familiar and ea&s;y in his remarks, and de&s;ired me to ob&s;erve the &s;now on Mount Atlas, which his carriage immediately fronted, wi&s;hing to know if we had the &s;ame in my country. I an&s;wered, that we frequently had a great deal in the winter &s;ea&s;on, and that England was a much colder climate than Morocco. The emperor ob&s;erved, that if any per&s;on attempted to go to the top of the mountain, he would die from exce&s;s of cold. He then in|formed me, that on the other &s;ide of the mountain was a very fine, plain, and fertile country, which was named Tafilet.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="027216_0159_0FD3E0EC8A999B98">Ob&s;erving that the emperor was now in a good humour, I embraced the oportunity of mention|ing to him, how much my feelings had been hurt by the malicious reports which had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t circulating to my prejudice; that they were of &s;uch a nature as to make me very de&s;irous of having my character cleared up, by a proper examination into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the prince's health, as well as into the nature of the medicines which I had been admini&s;tering to him. The emperor in reply &s;aid, that he had already ordered his Moori&s;h phy&s;ician to examine very particularly my medicines; who had declared that he could find nothing improper in them. It is very clear, however, that &s;ome &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t have taken place in the brea&s;t of the emperor, to have induced him to &s;end privately for the&s;e medicines, for the purpo&s;e of having them &s;o nicely examined; from which circum&s;tance I could not help feeling it as a very fortunate event for my&s;elf, that the prince's health was in &s;o favourable a &s;tate.</P>
<P>After a conver&s;ation of &s;ome length, the heads of which I have endeavoured briefly to &s;tate, the evening being far advanced, the emperor com|manded one of his attendants to conduct me home to his Jew, and de&s;ire him to take great care of me; adding, that I was a good man, I was Muley Ab&s;ulem's phy&s;ician, and that he would &s;end me home to my entire &s;atisfaction. He then ordered his carriage to drive on.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering my&s;elf as now acquitted of the charges which had been in&s;inuated again&s;t me, and elevated by the emperor's promi&s;es at the audience, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I returned home with a much
<PB N="152" REF="027216_0160_0FD3E0EDCE8383E0">
lighter heart than I could boa&s;t of when I went. I now only waited for the arrival of the prince at Morocco, which I conceived would confirm the emperor's good wi&s;hes towards me, and make my &s;ituation as agreeable as I could expect. Such are the &s;anguine hopes with which we are apt to flatter our&s;elves, after having encountered dif|ficulties, when the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect opens of relief.</P>
<P>In the evening my room was filled with a num|ber of the attendants of the emperor, who came to congratulate me on the honour I had received by a &s;ight of their royal ma&s;ter; at the &s;ame time to demand pre&s;ents, which on &s;uch occa&s;ions, they alleged was a cu&s;tom to which all Europeans &s;ub|mitted. As therefore I &s;aw there were no other means of relieving my&s;elf from their impertinent importunities, I was obliged in &s;ome degree to, comply with their demands.</P>
<P>I found the emperor Sidi Mahomet to be a tall thin old man, of near eighty years of age, and of a &s;allow complexion. From a vi&s;age naturally long, and a di&s;tortion of one eye, united with an acquired habit of au&s;terity, his appearance at fir&s;t was rather di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;trangers; but that im|pre&s;&s;ion was &s;oon worn off by the affability of his conver&s;ation, which he generally confined to tho&s;e &s;ubjects he thought mo&s;t adapted to the per&s;on with whom he conver&s;ed. At the &s;ame time he di&s;played a great de&s;ire to acquire information, as well as to di&s;cover the abilities of others. Some years ago he &s;o far lo&s;t the u&s;e of his feet as to di&s;able him from walking. This di&s;agreeable effect was probably owing to want of u&s;e, and to his
<PB N="153" REF="027216_0161_0FD3E0EF4DE6B740">
accu&s;toming him&s;elf con&s;tantly to be either in his carriage or on hor&s;eback. When I &s;aw him, his beard and eye-brows, though before, as I was informed, very dark, had acquired a perfect white|ne&s;s, and his voice was much impaired. His dre&s;s was exactly &s;imilar to that of other Moors, differ|ing only in the finene&s;s of the materials, and he was only di&s;tingui&s;hed from his &s;ubjects by a lar|ger retinue, riding in a carriage, or when on hor&s;eback having an umbrella carried before him.</P>
<P>From the general tenour of his conduct through|out his reign, and from his conver&s;ation, Sidi Mahomet appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trong natural talents, to which had a good education been united, he might have proved a great monarch. But the want of education, and the illiberality and &s;u|per&s;tition of his religion, betrayed him frequently into cruelty; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of arbitrary power tinged his character with that intolerable caprice which has ever di&s;tingui&s;hed and di&s;graced the Moori&s;h princes.</P>
<P>Avaricious from his youth, he gave his whole attention to the accumulation of wealth; and it was from that motive only that he appeared to give more encouragement to European merchants than any of his predece&s;&s;ors. It is at the &s;ame time well known, that he occa&s;ionally oppre&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch heavy duties, that they have been obliged to &s;end home their ve&s;&s;els empty. In hopes of adding &s;till more to his trea&s;ures, Sidi Mahomet became him&s;elf a merchant, took up goods from Europeans, and obliged the Jews to pay him five times their value for them; &s;o that there was not
<PB N="154" REF="027216_0162_0FD3E0F0DB298978">
a &s;ingle re&s;ource for becoming rich of which he did not avail him&s;elf. Avaricious to this exce&s;s, and naturally of a very timid di&s;po&s;ition, his great object has been peace: well aware that war could neither enrich him, nor contribute to his enjoy|ments in any re&s;pect.</P>
<P>His reign, it is true, has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by fewer in&s;tances of cruelty than that of any of his predece&s;&s;ors, but he has certainly exceeded them all in the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his attacks upon private property. He was always &s;urrounded by people, who, for the &s;ake of ri&s;ing into favour, were at all times ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> give him information concern|ing any of his &s;ubjects who were rich. It was then his u&s;ual cour&s;e of proceeding, to invent &s;ome plea for confining them in pri&s;on; and if that did not &s;ucceed, he put them in irons, chain|ed them down, and proceeded in a cour&s;e of &s;everity and cruelty, till at la&s;t, wearied out with puni&s;hments and di&s;graces, the unfortunate vic|tims &s;urrendered the whole of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; which alone procured them the enjoyment of liberty, an oportunity of again obtaining &s;u&s;i&s;tence, or perhaps of once more becoming the prey of the rapacious monarch. Such of his &s;ons as were in friend&s;hip with him, were continually making him pre&s;ents, as if apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame fate; and &s;ince I left the country it has been &s;trongly reported that my patient Muley Ab&s;u|lem, who was the only &s;on for whom the empe|ror profe&s;&s;ed much affection, was plundered by his father of the greate&s;t part of his riches; which indeed were reputed to be very con&s;ider|able.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="027216_0163_0FD3E0F61E1C4080">Vices are never &s;olitary; and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t naturally connected with an avaricious and timid di&s;po&s;ition, are jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion. Con|&s;cious how little he de&s;erved the affection of his people, and latterly &s;en&s;ible of having totally lo&s;t it, Sidi Mahomet was in con&s;tant fear of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion and poi&s;on. In this &s;tate he dragged on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence; an example to arbitrary kings, and a living proof that the picture exhibited of the Roman tyrant, by the &s;arca&s;tic hi&s;torian, was not overcharged. He &s;eldom &s;tirred out of his palace, unle&s;s accompanied by a numerous band of &s;oldiers, and even of the&s;e he had always his &s;u&s;picions. At night he had con&s;tantly &s;ix blood|hounds in his chamber, and relying more on the fidelity of the irrational creation than on man, he thought the&s;e a more certain guard than his &s;oldiers. His victuals were dre&s;&s;ed and ta&s;ted in his pre&s;ence; and at dinner, though no per&s;on was per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itted to eat immediately with him, yet he always had &s;ome of his &s;ons and mini&s;ters in the &s;ame apartment, who were helped out of his di&s;h. To complete the mi&s;ery of this unfortunate old man, he lived under the continual apprehen&s;ion of being conquered by his elde&s;t &s;on Muley Yazid, the late emperor, who, in con&s;equence of &s;ome ill treatment received from his father, retired &s;ecretly from court, and took refuge in a &s;anctuary near Tetuan.</P>
<P>This prince, who&s;e grandmother was an Engli&s;h woman, had acquired the univer&s;al e&s;teem of the whole country by his generous conduct and his great abilities; and though at that time in a &s;tate of poverty, and with only four attendants about
<PB N="156" REF="027216_0164_0FD3E0F947B8AB58">
him, &s;uch was his influence that he had only to &s;tep forward, and &s;ay he wanted money and troops, and he would &s;hortly have been at the head of an army, that mu&s;t at any time have entirely overwhelmed the late government of Morocco. From motives of duty, and perhaps of policy, this however was a &s;tep he did not wi&s;h to take, con&s;cious that his father could not long &s;urvive, and that upon his death he was certain of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The emperor, notwith|&s;tanding, was &s;till unable to &s;ubdue his appre|hen&s;ions; and when I was at Morocco &s;ent an army of five thou&s;and blacks, with an order to violate the &s;anctuary, and carry off the prince. This order was not obeyed, for the chief could not place &s;ufficient confidence in his troops; and the prince continued quiet in the &s;actuary till his father's decea&s;e.</P>
<P>To evince the policy, as well as the &s;agacity of Muley Yazid, I mu&s;t beg leave to relate an anecdote, which occurred a &s;hort time previous to that period. The people who have the care of the &s;anctuary received po&s;itive orders from the emperor to expel the prince by force; which, if they failed in doing, he a&s;&s;ured them he would &s;end and put every man, woman, and child in the neighbourhood of the &s;anctuary to the &s;word. The people, though well di&s;po&s;ed to the prince, intimidated by the&s;e orders, related faithfully to him the emperor's intentions, and informed him that, as their lives were at &s;take, they expected him to remove, at the &s;ame time recommending him to another &s;anctuary at no great di&s;tance, where he could equally take refuge. The prince,
<PB N="157" REF="027216_0165_0FD3E0F9C9F2B8F0">
who is one of the be&s;t hor&s;emen in the country, and who had a hor&s;e of which he had the en|tire command, immediately promi&s;ed them to depart, and mounted his hor&s;e for the purpo&s;e. But what was their &s;urpri&s;e, when they found the hor&s;e would not &s;tir from the &s;pot, notwith|&s;tanding the apparently free u&s;e of whip and &s;pur? Upon this the prince exclaimed, <Q>You &s;ee plain|ly that it is God's will I &s;hould continue here, and therefore no other power &s;hall ever drive me out.</Q> This had &s;uch an effect upon the &s;uper&s;titious multitude, that they preferred ri&s;king the re&s;entment of the emperor, to the violation of what, in their e&s;timation, was &s;o apparently the will of God.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other features of the em|peror's character, his principal vices appear to have re&s;ulted from that great corrupter of the human heart, arbitrary power: for he was the mo&s;t arbitrary of monarchs, having at his ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al the lives and properties of all his &s;ubjects. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, what man can be tru&s;ted, nay, who would tru&s;t him&s;elf? In &s;uch circum|&s;tances, can we wonder, when we ob&s;erve the occa&s;ional indulgence of intemperate revenge? Among the&s;e we are to account his treatment of an unfortunate Jew who had imprudently written &s;omething to his prejudice, and for this &s;light of|fence was quartered alive, cut to pieces, and his flesh afterwards given to the dogs.</P>
<P>Upon another occa&s;ion, a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition was manife&s;ted by Sidi Mahomet. A Moor of &s;ome con&s;equence, and very opulent, gave a grand entertainment on the marriage of one of his &s;ons.
<PB N="158" REF="027216_0166_0FD3E0FB9015EF68">
The emperor, who happened to be in the neigh|bourhood, and who well knew that magnificence was a &s;triking proof of wealth, was determined to be pre&s;ent at the fe&s;tival, in order that he might more fully inform him&s;elf of the circum|&s;tances of the Moor. For this purpo&s;e he di&s;|gui&s;ed him&s;elf in a common dre&s;s, and entered the hou&s;e in the mid&s;t of all the jollity, and perhaps the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the entertainment. The ma&s;ter of the ceremonies ob&s;erving a per&s;on of mean ap|pearance intrude him&s;elf into the room &s;o abrupt|ly, ordered him out; and upon the refu&s;al of the &s;tranger, he gave him a kick, and pu&s;hed him by violence out of the hou&s;e. For a &s;hort &s;pace of time after this occurrence the whole affair pa&s;&s;ed with|out notice, and probably had e&s;caped the memory of mo&s;t; and it was a matter of the utmo&s;t &s;urprize to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, to receive an order com|manding him immediately to repair to Morocco. Upon being introduced to the emperor, he was a&s;ked if he recollected the circum&s;tances which have ju&s;t been related, to which he replied in the affirmative. "Know then," &s;ays the emperor, <Q>I was that Moor whom you treated thus con|tumeliou&s;ly; and to convince you that I have not forgot it, that foot and that hand which in&s;ulted me &s;hall peri&s;h.</Q>&mdash;I have &s;een this un|fortunate victim of tyranny walking about the &s;treets with one leg and an arm.</P>
<P>The emperor was as ready to revenge the ima|ginary or the real injuries of his &s;ubjects. To elucidate this a&s;&s;ertion; an Engli&s;h and French gentleman were amu&s;ing them&s;elves by the diver|&s;ion of cour&s;ing, in the vicinity of Mogodore,
<PB N="159" REF="027216_0167_0FD3E0FD9F4E1190">
when one of their dogs unfortunately attacked the calf of a Moor. This accident &s;oon brought out the villagers, who immediately &s;hot the dog, and entered into a very &s;erious quarrel with the Chri&s;tians, which terminated in a general conte&s;t. The women of the village now thought it a pro|per occa&s;ion for their interference; and among their number was one, who from old age had lo&s;t all her teeth except two, and the&s;e were &s;o loo&s;e that they could be with difficulty retained; and another, who had upon a former occa&s;ion frac|tured her arm, the bone of which had never been reduced or united. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;pute, the&s;e two women were unintentionally thrown down, and by this accident the old lady lo&s;t both her teeth, while the other in&s;i&s;ted that the Chri&s;|tians had been the occa&s;ion of fracturing her arm. To be brief, the Chri&s;tians were overpowered by numbers, and were obliged to retire to Mogodore, where they immediately made a complaint to the governor of the in&s;ults they had received from the Moors, who in their turn al&s;o appeared before him with a complaint again&s;t the Chri&s;tians. The whole being referred to the emperor, both parties were ordered up to court, with the view of giving the matter an impartial hearing, and of admini&s;|tering ju&s;tice accordingly. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to intimate, that in this uncivilized country, and with a man of Sidi Mahomet's prejudices, the Moori&s;h evidence would be certain of a favour|able hearing. The circum&s;tances indeed of one woman lo&s;ing her teeth, and another having her arm fractured, appeared in the eyes of the empe|ror &s;o plau&s;ible, that upon their being made known
<PB N="160" REF="027216_0168_0FD3E0FF38184678">
to him, without he&s;itation he ordered the Chri&s;|tians to be put in irons, and confined till he &s;hould determine upon the puni&s;hment which &s;uch appa|rent crimes merited. For this purpo&s;e, the Mufti, or high prie&s;t was de&s;ired to refer the matter to the Koran, with a view of puni&s;hing the delin|quents according to its dictates. The prie&s;t &s;oon found out a pa&s;&s;age, where it &s;pecies an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. The Engli&s;h gen|tleman, whom the old lady fixed upon for the per&s;on who had been the occa&s;ion of her misfor|tune, was therefore directed to lo&s;e two of his teeth, which puni&s;hment was immediately put in execution in the pre&s;ence of the emperor; while his French companion, as they could not find out a puni&s;hment in the Koran for breaking an arm, received the ba&s;tinado in a manner which di&s;|graced humanity and the law of nations; the pri|&s;oners were then &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance brings to my mind how nar|rowly I e&s;caped falling into a &s;imilar predicament in the cour&s;e of my detention at Morocco. One day, within the walls of the palace, I was gro&s;sly in&s;ulted by a Moor, at a time when, from the great anxiety I was under, my temper was much di&s;turbed, and which &s;o far had put me off my guard as to induce me to give the offender a blow on the face. Upon this a Moori&s;h &s;oldier, who, unob&s;erved by my&s;elf, was &s;itting behind me in a corner of the wall, exclaimed in Arabic in a very au&s;tere tone, "Chri&s;tian, how dare you &s;trike that Moor?" A full con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted imprudently, and a recollection of the emperor's former treatment of Chri&s;tians under &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="161" REF="027216_0169_0FD3E100950341D8">
now pre&s;&s;ed upon my mind with &s;uch force, that at fir&s;t I was at a lo&s;s what part I &s;hould take to extricate my&s;elf from this difficul|ty. To walk away, would be an acknowledg|ment of guilt, and would afford the Moor a greater plea for making a complaint; I therefore determined upon returning back and expo&s;tulating with the man, by telling him that I had been gro&s;sly in&s;ulted, and mu&s;t therefore be under the nece&s;&s;ity of making immediate application to the governor of the town to have the offender &s;everely puni&s;hed for attacking one, who, from the nature of his employment, was in the emperor's &s;ervice, and con&s;equently under his particular protection. In reply, the Moor &s;aid, that had I kicked him, hor&s;ewhipped him, or puni&s;hed him in any other way but that of &s;lapping his face, he &s;hould have over-looked it; but a blow on the face was in their law a crime of &s;o &s;erious a nature, that he thought it his duty to acquaint the emperor of it, who had hitherto never pardoned any per&s;on convicted of &s;o heinous an offence, but had always cut off that hand of the Moor which had offered the in|&s;ult; what then could a Chri&s;tian expect from him? From the knowledge I had already learn|ed of the Moori&s;h character, I &s;till thought it nece&s;&s;ary to continue in the &s;ame &s;train, by in|forming the Moor, that he might act as he thought proper, but that I &s;hould &s;till fulfil my re&s;olution, and had no doubt but it would have its proper effect. The man now began to &s;often, and &s;aid, that as I was in the emperor's &s;ervice, he would for this time look over the offence, but cautioned me to be careful how I acted in future.
<PB N="162" REF="027216_0170_0FD3E10283108008">
Upon con&s;idering every circum&s;tance I thought it mo&s;t prudent to let the matter drop here; and I acknowledge that this affair proved a &s;ufficient le&s;&s;on to me to avoid in future entering into &s;imi|lar conte&s;ts with the Moors.</P>
<P>Sidi Mahomet was &s;ufficiently con&s;cious of his own power and dignity, and kept every per&s;on at the mo&s;t abject di&s;tance; no per&s;on daring to approach or &s;peak to him without his permi&s;&s;ion. Sen&s;ible al&s;o of the exce&s;&s;es into which he might be betrayed by ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion, if at any time he found his temper di&s;compo&s;ed, he indi&s;crimi|nately ordered every per&s;on out of his &s;ight. It may ea&s;ily be conceived that the monarch had no difficulty in &s;ecuring obedience to this mandate, &s;ince all were &s;en&s;ible that to have continued in his pre&s;ence would have been highly dangerous, if not fatal.</P>
<P>The only per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any con&s;ider|able influence over the emperor were his women; and it was through that channel that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted with him.</P>
<P>Thus far for the vices of arbitrary power. But deceit, hypocri&s;y and fal&s;ehood were qualities which could not be immediately a&s;cribed to that &s;ource, unle&s;s we con&s;ider them as the nece&s;&s;ary effects of an education in a de&s;potic court. As a cloak to actions which he knew mu&s;t excite di&s;ap|probation and di&s;gu&s;t, Sidi Mahomet attempted to per&s;uade his &s;ubjects that they proceeded from motives of religion and ju&s;tice; and to give them a greater &s;anction he enrolled him&s;elf in the frater|nity of &s;aints, and paid a &s;trict attention to all the &s;uper&s;titions and form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> peculiar to his religion.
<PB N="163" REF="027216_0171_0FD3E1048933CDF0">
This conduct an&s;wered well with the ignorant part of the community, but the more enlightened could not but ob&s;erve that he attended more to the ceremonial of his religion than to its principles, which he made no &s;cruple of violating whenever it &s;uited his convenience. What he promi&s;ed one day he would refu&s;e the next, &s;o that no depen|dance was ever placed upon his word. Ad|ded to the&s;e, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large portion of that low cunning which is common to per&s;ons who&s;e minds and &s;entiments have not been elevated or refined by literature or &s;cience. He perhaps, in|deed, found this quality not without its u&s;es in governing &s;uch a people as the Moors; and no man under&s;tood their character and di&s;po&s;ition better than he did. He was aware that re&s;pect is frequently de&s;troyed by un&s;ea&s;onable familiari|ties, and therefore kept at a mo&s;t &s;tately di&s;tance from his &s;ubjects, and but &s;eldom appeared among them. By the&s;e means his con&s;equence was pre&s;erved, and his conduct, and his talents were involved in that impenetrable and awful mi&s;t that &s;urrounds the &s;eraglios of Ea&s;tern mo|narchs.</P>
<P>The few rebellions which occurred during his long reign, proved deci&s;ively that he knew how to govern his &s;ubjects. Whenever a di&s;po&s;ition for revolt prevailed in any of the provinces, a body of troops was immediately di&s;patched to plunder the whole of the di&s;contented province, and to &s;eize the in&s;urgents, who were immediate|ly conducted to court, and puni&s;hed according to the magnitude of their re&s;pective offences. Some were put to death, others were deprived
<PB N="164" REF="027216_0172_0FD3E105CD587548">
of their hands and legs; and for le&s;&s;er crimes the di&s;contented parties underwent the ba&s;tinado. This monarch employed per&s;ons in different di&s;|tricts to watch the motions of his &s;ubjects, and to inform him of every &s;ymptom of revolt; and thus, by a well-timed interference, he was enabled to cru&s;h rebellion in the bud.</P>
<P>In his conduct towards foreign powers, Sidi Mahomet di&s;covered the &s;ame di&s;regard to truth and ju&s;tice, the &s;ame adroitne&s;s and cunning. He readily promi&s;ed to grant every demand, provided he was to be well paid for the conce&s;&s;ion. But it mu&s;t have been valuable pre&s;ents indeed which would induce him to perform his promi&s;e. He protracted negociations in order that he and his mini&s;ters might be enriched by them; but al|ways as much as po&s;&s;ible avoided bringing them to a final deternination, by either granting or re|fu&s;ing a favour.</P>
<P>If foreign powers omitted to pay him the tri|bute he demanded, he immediately threatened in the &s;evere&s;t manner to commence ho&s;tilities; yet in this he was never in earne&s;t, for he was more afraid of his enemies than they had rea&s;on to be of him. When he found they were not di&s;|po&s;ed to contend the matter with him, he increa&s;ed his demands accordingly.</P>
<P>In order to enhance his con&s;equence, he en|deavoured to per&s;uade his &s;ubjects that he was remarkably &s;killed in matters of which they were entirely ignorant. To pre&s;erve an appearance of ability, when he was vi&s;ited by Europeans, if the &s;tranger was a merchant, the &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation was on manufactures, foreign commerce,
<PB N="165" REF="027216_0173_0FD3E10831F6AA28">
&amp;c. If he was a military officer, fortifications, attacks, &amp;c. were the topics; and if a &s;eafaring per&s;on, he would then &s;cratch on a piece of paper a plan of his coa&s;ts and harbours. Though he rarely advanced any thing to the purpo&s;e on the&s;e &s;ubjects; yet as foreigners who vi&s;ited the court generally appeared there with a view of obtaining &s;ome favour, and as it was never cu&s;tomary for any per&s;on to contradict the emperor, they al|ways coincided with his opinions, and pretended at lea&s;t to admire his exten&s;ive abilities. This fully an&s;wered the intention of the emperor; it induced his &s;ubjects to form a good opinion of his under&s;tanding, and he often collected &s;ome real information from the an&s;wers which his vi&s;itors returned to his que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Sidi Mahomet paid more attention to military affairs than to his navy, though if any power re|fu&s;ed to repair a frigate, it was a &s;ufficient induce|ment for him to threaten a war. He thought him&s;elf perfectly acquainted with the art of for|tification, but his knowledge of it extended no farther than a few loo&s;e hints which he had re|ceived upon the &s;ubject from tho&s;e Europeans who had vi&s;ited the court.</P>
<P>In his court and per&s;onal appearance, Sidi Ma|homet affected great &s;implicity of manners, not allowing even his own &s;ons to appear in his pre|&s;ence except in a plain Moori&s;h dre&s;s. They then were obliged to uncover their cap or turban (for a Moor never pulls off either except when going to bed) and to wear in&s;tead of the Haick the Sulam, which is a cloak made of white or blue woollen cloth, the front parts of which they were obliged to throw over their &s;houlders, and as obliged
<PB N="166" REF="027216_0174_0FD3E10B3843A7F0">
&s;oon as they &s;aw the emperor, to pro&s;trate their heads to the ground, and ki&s;s it, exclaiming, <Q>God &s;ave the king!</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then ordered them to ap|proach, and &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>Though in general of a &s;tately demeanour, he was &s;ometimes known to unbend, and occa&s;ion|ally took plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with his courtiers on various &s;ubjects; but they were permitted to advance no opinion of their own, but merely to approve of what he &s;aid. He frequently talked upon the &s;ubject of religion, and con&s;idered him|&s;elf as well informed in that particular. He &s;ometimes endeavoured to explain to them dif|ferent parts of the Koran, pointing out its beau|ties, and impre&s;&s;ing on the minds of his auditors the mo&s;t intolerant prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The mixture of good and evil &s;o incident to all human characters, was al&s;o to be found in Sidi Mahomet. Notwith&s;tanding what has been remarked of his avarice, his duplicity, and ab&s;urd preten&s;ions to religion, there are &s;ome circum|&s;tances which &s;erve to le&s;&s;en our indignation, and the&s;e it is only con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and candour to &s;tate. It is generally allowed, that though he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer in a compari&s;on with the princes of free and civilized nations, yet when compared with his de&s;potic predece&s;&s;ors, his cha|racter greatly ri&s;es in the &s;cale of humanity. He was &s;eldom or never wontonly cruel. He was certainly &s;ometimes too ha&s;ty in pronouncing &s;en|tence on criminals, for which he has been often known to expre&s;s the &s;tronge&s;t &s;entiments of re|mor&s;e; and his de&s;ire to prevent any ill effects from his pa&s;&s;ions has been already remarked.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="027216_0175_0FD3E10C79335368">In his admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice he generally acted very impartially, except indeed when his own intere&s;t was immediately concerned, and then every other feeling gave way. It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledged, that though him|&s;elf a mo&s;t notorious violator of the laws, he &s;o far re&s;pected them that he never would permit others to follow his example. Though &s;o ex|tremely avaricious, it has been already &s;tated that in &s;ome &s;evere in&s;tances of public di&s;tre&s;s, he gene|rou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ed his trea&s;ures to admini&s;ter relief to the &s;ufferers; and the number of poor peo|ple who were daily fed at his palace, of which I was an eye-witne&s;s, plainly evinced that he was not de&s;titute of charity. Europeans met with greater encouragement, and the wheels of com|merce were le&s;s clogged, during the reign of Sidi Mahomet than at any preceding period.</P>
<P>Thus was this monarch a &s;ingular compound of liberality and intolerance, of avarice and benevo|lence, of cruelty and compa&s;&s;ion. It is perhaps only a &s;tate of de&s;poti&s;m that we behold this con|fu&s;ion of character. The legal re&s;traints of civi|lized life, form them&s;elves into habits; and the eccentricities and caprices to which circum&s;tances, &s;ituation, the &s;tate of the health, or perhaps the variations of the climate, di&s;po&s;e the human mind, are no longer found to exi&s;t in European countries, or to exi&s;t in an inferior degree. Happy it is, when any re&s;traints are impo&s;ed upon us, to prevent us from doing evil. Man is a creature not formed for arbitrary power. So limited are his views, &s;o variable his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o violent
<PB N="168" REF="027216_0176_0FD3E11058A21B48">
and tyrannical his pa&s;&s;ions, that the wi&s;e&s;t of men would certainly not wi&s;h for ab&s;olute authority, and the be&s;t, if entru&s;ted with it, would pro|bably abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>The conduct of the emperor towards foreign courts has already been noticed. His means of extracting money from them by threatining a war, which perhaps in reality he dreaded, has been likewi&s;e &s;tated. It will probably not be un&s;ea&s;on|able in this place to introduce a few remarks on their conduct towards him.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t and mo&s;t naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion is&mdash;that nothing but gro&s;s neglect or inexcu&s;able ignorance could induce the European princes in general to remain in a kind of tributary &s;tate to a prince, who had neither an army nor a fleet which de&s;erved the name, and a a people who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition is le&s;s &s;uited to enterprize than perhaps any other.</P>
<P>What had they to fear from him? His whole fleet con&s;i&s;ted only of a few &s;mall frigates and row|boats, ill managed and wor&s;e manned, the whole of which might have been de&s;troyed in one day by two or three well-appointed European frigates. The entrances of tho&s;e ports where he laid up his &s;hipping, if we except Tangier and Larache, are, as I before ob&s;erved, &s;o continually choaking up with &s;and, that in a &s;hort time they will only admit fi&s;hing-boats, or the very &s;malle&s;t craft. The towns are none of them regularly fortified, except Mogodore, and that hardly produces half a dozen men who under&s;tand the lea&s;t of working the guns. And yet this contemptible power gives
<PB N="169" REF="027216_0177_0FD3E112D2713CB8">
laws to all the coa&s;ts of Portugal and Spain, and may be &s;aid in &s;ome mea&s;ure to command the en|trance of the Mediterranean!</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, he was too trifling a power to notice; if &s;o, why lavi&s;h immen&s;e pre&s;ents for the purpo&s;e of keeping him in temper? Tho&s;e who imagined they &s;ecured his friend&s;hip by the&s;e means were much mi&s;taken; on the contrary, they only added fuel to that flame of avarice which was not to be extingui&s;hed, if he was one day pre&s;ented with a frigate, he a&s;ked for two the next; and the more his reque&s;ts were indul|ged, the more his inordinate de&s;ires were in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is well known to tho&s;e who have been con|ver&s;ant with the Moors, that to &s;ecure their friend&s;hip you mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;&s;ert your own &s;uperiori|ty, and then if you make them a trifling pre&s;ent, its value is trebled in their e&s;timation. The &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition would have been found in Sidi Ma|homet, as in the common Moor. So far from courting an alliance, it would rather have been good policy at once to quarrel with him; the lo&s;s of a few towns and particularly Mogodore, to which he was much attached, from its being rai&s;ed under his own au&s;pices, would &s;oon have reduced him to good humour and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The emperor's title is, <Q>Emperor of Africa; Emperor of Morocco; king of Fez, Suz, and Gago; lord of Dara and Guinea; and great Sharif of Mahomet.</Q></P>
<P>The principal amu&s;ement of the emperor was latterly ob&s;erving his &s;oldiers fire with mu&s;quets at targets, and rewarding tho&s;e who were &s;uc|ce&s;sful with &s;mall pieces of money. He al&s;o occa|&s;ionally
<PB N="170" REF="027216_0178_0FD3E1141E75AF08">
entertained him&s;elf with falcons; but in general he &s;pent the greater part of his time with his women.</P>
<P>The emperor received foreigners, and tran&s;acted all public bu&s;ine&s;s, either in his carriage or on hor&s;eback, in &s;ome of the open &s;paces within the palace. Formerly, indeed, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, it was &s;ometimes cu&s;tomary to admit &s;trangers in|to one of the rooms; and then he obliged them to conform to the cu&s;tom of the country, by pulling off their &s;hoes when in his pre&s;ence: but &s;ome &s;pirited Europeans a few years ago having refu&s;ed to pay that homage, he ever afterwards gave them audience in one of his court-yards. The Spani&s;h friars at Morocco only were an exception to this rule, for upon their informing him that they never pulled off their &s;hoes to any power under God, he always permitted them to enter his room with them on.</P>
<P>Previous to a &s;tranger, whether an European or Moor, obtaining and audience of his Moori&s;h Maje&s;ty, a pre&s;ent was always made to one of his mini&s;ters, as an inducement to him to acquaint his &s;overeign that a &s;tranger &s;olicited that honour. The fir&s;t pre&s;ent, unle&s;s it was &s;omething very hand&s;ome, did not always &s;ucceed; and it was frequently nece&s;&s;ary to apply to two or three mini|&s;ters to procure a &s;peedy audience, or even to &s;end in a pre&s;ent to one of the Sultanas, none of whom entertained any very unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations about ac|cepting the compliment. The latter was indeed the mo&s;t certain mode of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>After having &s;o far accompli&s;hed his wi&s;hes, the &s;tranger was next liable to be detained a longer or a &s;horter time before the capricious monarch
<PB N="171" REF="027216_0179_0FD3E1159027CDA0">
would fix on a day for receiving him. Even after this he would frequently &s;end for him in a violent hurry to the palace, and when there keep him &s;tand|ing in one of the open courts &s;everal hours; he would then &s;end an excu&s;e for not admitting him on that day; and this agreeable proce&s;s was in many in&s;tances repeated three or four times. The tar|dine&s;s, in&s;olence, and irregularity, of the court of Morocco, is indeed beyond conception; and tho&s;e who have bu&s;ine&s;s there, ought to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the philo&s;ophy and patience of a Stoic, if they would avoid the deprivation of their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>No per&s;on whatever, whether Moor or Chri&s;|tian, was admitted into the pre&s;ence of the &s;ove|reign, but when accompanied with a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, more or le&s;s valuable, in proportion to the favour to be reque&s;ted. Even the emperor's own &s;ons were not exempted from this cu&s;tom, upon paying their fir&s;t vi&s;it after a previous ab|&s;ence. The genero&s;ity of the &s;uitor mu&s;t not even &s;top here; for when the audience is over, the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies with his &s;ervants, and the porters of all the gates of the palace, which are rather numerous, have a claim for their per|qui&s;ites, and are not to be got rid of till they ob|tain &s;omething. Indeed, as they receive no pay from their royal ma&s;ter, the&s;e perqui&s;ites were the only means they had of obtaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For the &s;ati&s;faction of tho&s;e who may have occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the court of Morocco upon bu&s;ine&s;s, I have with difficulty obtained an account of the fees which are u&s;ual|ly paid by European merchants to the emperor's attend|ants.

only naturally very forgetful, but &s;ometimes, from political motives, intentionally &s;o. He was very well aware that the longer &s;trangers were detained at Morocco, the more his mini&s;ters would be en|riched by them; and as the money came at la&s;t, though by a circuitous cour&s;e, into his own pocket, he u&s;ed frequently to forget that &s;trangers were waiting for their di&s;patches. The mini&s;ters, on the other hand, unle&s;s &s;timulated by &s;ub&s;tantial pre&s;ents, were generally extremely dilatory in re|minding him of them; and there have been many in&s;tances of foreigners being detained at Morocco five or &s;ix weeks, entirely owing to this circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the court of Morocco, it lat|terly hardly de&s;erved that appellation. When the emperor was young, his faculties clear, and his abilities in their prime, he entru&s;ted to his mi|ni&s;ters a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the public bu&s;ine&s;s; but within the few la&s;t years of his life, when his &s;trength of body as well as of mind were worn out by hard &s;ervices and old age, either from &s;u&s;picion or dotage, he took the reins of govern|ment entirely into his own hands. The mini&s;ters and &s;ecretaries not daring to notice the mi&s;takes of the &s;overeign, were obliged to write out letters and &s;end orders, which were contradicted almo&s;t every hour, and which occa&s;ioned the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion. The court of Morocco, indeed, under the mo&s;t advantageous circum&s;tances, was always notorious for its irregularity and contradiction; but a &s;hort time previous to the emperor's death, the government could &s;carcely be &s;aid to exi&s;t at all.</P>

<P><PB N="176" REF="027216_0184_0FD3CBA6143CB5B8">Upon taking a retro&s;pective view of the em|ployments under the emperor of Morocco, we &s;hall not find that they differ &s;o much from tho&s;e of other &s;tates, as might have been imagined, from the ignorance of the European cu&s;toms ob&s;ervable in this people in other re&s;pects. The places of Ef|fendi and principal &s;ecretary to the trea&s;ury being united in one per&s;on, bears con&s;iderable analogy to the union of the office of prime mini&s;ter with tho&s;e of chancellor of the exchequer and fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury. The appointments of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, grand chamberlain, keeper of the great &s;eal, and grand fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oner, are all places which are well known in European courts; and many others have nearly the &s;ame corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>The principal difference between the court of Morocco and tho&s;e of Europe is, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e appointments in European courts enjoy very lucrative incomes from their re&s;pective &s;tates, while tho&s;e of Morocco receive none at all from the court. They depend &s;olely on the perqui&s;ites which are paid them by tho&s;e who have bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act with the court&punc; Even this, however, &s;ometimes forms a very incon&s;i|derable income, though always &s;ubject to defal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion from the rapacious hand of their &s;overeign, who &s;eizes upon every thing with which he comes in contact.</P>
<P>The Effendi to the emperor had a degree of addre&s;s, and an elegance of manners which would have done honour to an European courtier. He received a &s;tranger with a plea&s;ing &s;mile and a re&s;pectful bow; &s;hook him warmly by the hand,
<PB N="177" REF="027216_0185_0FD3E122025682C0">
enquired after his health, invited him to his hou&s;e, and offered him his &s;ervices. As he was rich, he was always extremely timid in the pre&s;ence of the emperor, notwith&s;tanding he annually made him a large pre&s;ent to keep him in temper. Some of the princes, and many others, followed his ex|ample in this re&s;pect, judiciou&s;ly preferring the enjoyment of a little with a certainty, to the run|ning a ri&s;k of the whole.</P>
<P>The emperor of late had no regular court days, but fixed upon them as inclination or convenience dictated. On tho&s;e days all the princes who were at Morocco, and every per&s;on in the imm|ediate &s;ervice of the emperor, were obliged to at|tend at the Machoire, an open part of the palace &s;o named, where they, with the &s;oldiers, were arranged in the form of a cre&s;cent; the mini&s;ters and &s;trangers in front, and the &s;overeign, either on hor&s;eback or in his carriage, in the centre. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions the public bu&s;ine&s;s in general was tran&s;acted, foreigners were received, grievances were &s;tated, complaints heard (every per&s;on being at liberty to apply to the emperor for redre&s;s) and malefactors were puni&s;hed in the pre&s;ence of the &s;overeign, and the whole court.</P>
<P>The revenues of the emperor of Morocco con|&s;i&s;t of a tenth on every article of con&s;umption, being the natural production of the country, as allowed him by the Koran; an annual tax upon the Jews; his cu&s;tom hou&s;e and exci&s;e duties; and the tributes which he exacts from his &s;ub|jects, foreign &s;tates, and European merchants, in the form of pre&s;ents. From the mo&s;t articles he derives the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of his income.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="027216_0186_0FD3E12421E11C68">The want of &s;ystem, and the caprice of Sidi Mahomet, was &s;uch that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what was the annual amount of all the&s;e branches of revenue. The duties were frequently changed three or four times in the cour&s;e of a year, and the tributes were &s;ubject to an equal degree of uncertainty. After all it has been a matter of great doubt and &s;peculation whether Sidi Mahomet was wealthy. From the greater encou|ragement to commerce during his reign, the trifling expence of his court, every per&s;on engaged about it, receiving little or no pay from the emperor, the uncommonly &s;evere exactions he enforced, and the numerous voluntary pre&s;ents he received, the na|tural conclu&s;ion was, that he mu&s;t have been very rich. On the other hand, however, his expences at the &s;ieges of Melilla and Mazagan are known to have been very con&s;iderable; and the&s;e, united to the valuable pre&s;ents he annually tran&s;mitted to the grand Seignior, and to the Sharifs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 115.</NOTE> of Mecca, are to be placed in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale; and when this is done, it will perhaps appear that his wealth was far from con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The land forces of the emperor of Morocco, con&s;i&s;t principally of black troops, the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e Negroes which Muley I&s;hmael imported from Guinea, and &s;ome few white, amounting al|together to an army of about thirty-fix thou|&s;and men upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment, two thirds of which are cavalry. This e&s;tabli&s;hment, however, upon occa&s;ion admits of a con&s;iderable in|crea&s;e, as every man is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;oldier,
<PB N="179" REF="027216_0187_0FD3E12524BFFD50">
and when called upon, is obliged to act in that capacity. About &s;ix thou&s;and of the &s;tanding forces form the emperor's body guard, and are always kept near his per&s;on; the remainder are quartered in the different towns of the empire, and are under the charge of the ba&s;haws of the provinces. They are all clothed by the emperor, and receive a trifling pay; but their chief depend|ance is on plunder, which they have frequent op|portunities of acquiring.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers have no di&s;tinction in dre&s;s from the other Moors, and are only marked by their accoutrements, which con&s;i&s;t of a &s;abre, a very long mu&s;quet, a &s;mall red leather box to hold their balls, which is fixed in front by means of a belt, and a powder-horn &s;lung over their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The army is under the direction of a com|mander in chief, four principal Ba&s;haws, and Al|caides who command di&s;tinct divi&s;ions. With re&s;pect to the Alcaides it is proper to remark, that there are three de&s;criptions of per&s;ons who bear this appellation: but tho&s;e to whom I at pre&s;ent allude are military officers, who command &s;oldiers from a thou&s;and to five hundred, twenty-five, or even four men in a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The black troops which I have been de&s;cribing are naturally of a very fiery di&s;po&s;ition, capable of enduring great fatigue, hunger, thir&s;t, and every difficulty to which a military life is ex|po&s;ed. They appear well calculated for &s;kirmi&s;h|ing parties, or for the purpo&s;e of harra&s;&s;ing an enemy; but were they obliged to undergo a re|gular attack, from their total want of di&s;cipline, they would &s;oon be routed. In all their man|oeuvres,
<PB N="180" REF="027216_0188_0FD3E128A1949A78">
they have no notion whatever of order and regularity, but have altogether more the ap|pearance of a rabble than of an army.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e troops are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upport of de&s;poti&s;m, yet from their avarice and love of variety, they frequently prove the mo&s;t dangerous enemies to their monarchs; they are often known to excite &s;edition and rebel|lion; and their in&s;olence has &s;ometimes proceeded to &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, as nearly to overturn the go|vernment. Their conduct is governed only by their pa&s;&s;ions. Tho&s;e who pay them be&s;t, and treat them with the greate&s;t attention, they will always be the mo&s;t ready to &s;upport. This cir|cum&s;tance, independent of every other, makes it the intere&s;t of the monarch to keep his &s;ubjects in as complete a &s;tate of poverty as po&s;&s;ible. The Moors are, indeed, remarkable for in&s;incerity in their attachments, and for their love of variety; a military force, in this kingdom e&s;pecially, is there|fore the only means which a de&s;potic monarch can employ for &s;ecuring him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. Ignorant of every principle of rational liberty, whatever conte&s;ts this devoted people may engage in with their tyrants, are merely con|te&s;ts for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the &s;ole object for which they &s;pend their lives and their pro|perty, is to exchange one mercile&s;s de&s;pot for an|other.</P>
<P>The emperor's navy con&s;i&s;ts of about fifteen &s;mall frigates, a few xebecks, and between twenty and thirty row-gallies. The whole is commanded&punc; by one admiral; but as the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are princi|pally u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of piracy, they &s;eldom

unite in a fleet. The number of &s;eaman in the &s;ervice, are computed at &s;ix thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I hare already noted the bad &s;tate of the ports of Morocco, and the probability of their becoming &s;till wor&s;e; it is therefore evident, that very little is to be apprehended from the emperor as a naval power; and indeed I am apt to believe, that though a con&s;iderable part of his dominions is apparently maritime, he will in the cour&s;e of &s;ome years be de&s;titute both of fleets and harbours.</P>
<P>When de&s;cribing the emperor's character, I ob|&s;erved, that there cannot exi&s;t a more ab&s;olute go|vernment than that of Morocco; the lives and properties of the &s;ubjects depending entirely on the will or caprice of the monarch. The forms of order and ju&s;tice are, however, &s;till pre&s;erved, though but very little of the &s;ub&s;tance remains.</P>
<P>An officer is appointed by the emperor for the government of every province, who, as I have already &s;tated, is named a Ba&s;haw; he is gener|ally a Moor of &s;ome di&s;tinction, and frequently one of the emperor's &s;ons. This officer, who is appointed or removed at the will of the &s;overeign, has almo&s;t an unlimited power throughout the province which he commands; he can inflict every puni&s;hment but death; can levy taxes, im|po&s;e fines, and in &s;hort can plunder any individual he plea&s;es; and indeed, if the reader will not &s;mile at the abu&s;e of words, the plundering of the public and of individuals may be con&s;idered as a part of his office. When by every &s;pecies of ra|pacity he has ama&s;&s;ed a large property, then it be|comes the bu&s;ine&s;s of the emperor to divert this trea&s;ure into his own coffers. Some frivolous
<PB N="182" REF="027216_0190_0FD3E12DA3D1A1C8">
plea is therefore invented for the impri&s;oning of the ba&s;haw, which is immediately put into execu|tion. The emperor then &s;eizes upon all his pro|perty, and afterwards rein&s;tates him in his govern|ment, in order that the &s;ame game may be played over again. So perfectly acquainted with man|kind in every &s;tate and &s;ituation, was our inimit|able Shake&s;peare:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ro&s;encrantz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take you me for a spunge, my lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hamlet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Sir; that &s;oaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But &s;uch officers do the king be&s;t &s;ervice in the end; he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; fir&s;t mouthed, to be at la&s;t &s;wallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but &s;queezing you, and &s;punge, you &s;hall be dry again.</P>
</SP>
<P>Subordinate to the ba&s;haw, the emperor ap|points governors to each town, named Alcaides, and officers with a &s;imilar authority in every Dou|har or encampment, who are called Shaiks; the&s;e officers have the &s;ame power inve&s;ted in them over their &s;everal di&s;tricts as the ba&s;haws have in their provinces. But in other re&s;pects their &s;itua|tion is wor&s;e, as they are not only &s;ubject to the tyranny of the emperor, but al&s;o of the ba&s;haw.</P>
<P>The Alcaide, or governor, is inve&s;ted with both the military and civil authority in the town where he re&s;ides. As a military officer, he com|mands a number of &s;oldiers, whom he employs for the public defence and tranquility, and al&s;o for enforcing the payment of taxes, for the puni&s;hing of delinquents, and to convey his orders and me&s;|&s;ages
<PB N="183" REF="027216_0191_0FD3E12DA95BC0D8">
to court, or into the country. As a civil officer, he has the entire cognizance of all criminal matters, for which he di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cretionally inflicts any puni&s;hment &s;hort of death.</P>
<P>If we only reflect on the dangerous extent of this almo&s;t unlimited power, it is ea&s;y to anticipate the abu&s;es of it in a country where &s;o little atten|tion is paid to ju&s;tice or honour. For the mo&s;t trifling offences the Alcaide condemns the delin|quent not only to be ba&s;tinadoed very &s;everely, and impri&s;oned, but al&s;o to pay him a &s;um of money, or pre&s;ent him with &s;ome other article equal in value, which probably the pri&s;oner has been half his life in acquiring. It frequently happens, indeed, that fal&s;e accu&s;ations are invented purpo&s;ely again&s;t individuals to plunder them of their property. This is not the only inconvenience ari&s;ing from an abu&s;e of power;&mdash;for let a per&s;on commit the mo&s;t notorious crime, if he can carry up a pre&s;ent to the governor of greater value than what was pre&s;ented by his accu&s;er, he is not only forgiven, but if he has the lea&s;t ingenuity, he will find very little difficulty in throwing the whole of the crime upon his antagoni&s;t. Indeed, in this country, ju&s;tice, or rather judgment, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily procured by purcha&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Under the Alcaide is an officer named Ell-hac|kum, or deputy governor, who&s;e office bears &s;ome analogy to our principal bailiff or con&s;table.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e officers, there is in every town a Cadi, who is both a civil judge and the chief prie&s;t; for it is well known that the civil and re|ligious in&s;titutions are united in the Koran. When any di&s;pute happens between individuals, re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="184" REF="027216_0192_0FD3E12F6650E620">
matters of right or property, debts, in&s;ults, &amp;c. the per&s;on who &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf injured may apply for redre&s;s to the Cadi, who is to determine the matter agreeably to the principles of the Koran. In the ab&s;ence of the Cadi, any of the Talbs, who are common prie&s;ts, are equally authori&s;ed to act for him. If the parties chu&s;e to employ lawyers, the pleadings mu&s;t be carried on in writing, otherwi&s;e they plead orally their own cau&s;es. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions the Cadi or Talbs cannot openly receive any payment, but it is well known that they are too frequently influenced by private pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The chief of the Cadis is the Mufti, who is al|&s;o the &s;upreme head of the church.</P>
<P>When any party in a &s;uit conceives that he has rea&s;on to complain of the juri&s;diction of the&s;e of|ficers, he has a right to appeal to the emperor, who gives public audiences for the purpo&s;e of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice. This cu&s;tom would be a great alleviation to the evils of de&s;poti&s;m, were the em|peror always to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice impartially; but valuable pre&s;ents have &s;ometimes too powerful an influence even over the &s;overeign him&s;elf. On this account, as well as on that of the great di&s;|tance of many of the provinces from the &s;eat of government, the people &s;eldom embrace this la&s;t re&s;ource in applying for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The mode of puni&s;hing criminals in this country depends entirely upon the will of the &s;overeign. Trifling offences are u&s;ually puni&s;hed by impri&s;on|ment and the ba&s;tinado, which is inflicting a certain number of &s;tripes on the back and legs by leather &s;traps, and which is &s;ometimes executed with
<PB N="185" REF="027216_0193_0FD3E1316614F660">
great &s;everity. For crimes of a more &s;erious na|ture, in &s;ome ca&s;es the hands are cut off, parti|cularly for &s;tealing, in others a leg and a hand. When I was at Morocco four men who had com|mitted murder had both their hands and legs cut off, and were afterwards &s;hot. Other criminals are run through with &s;words, knocked down with clubs, or are beheaded. Another mode of puni&s;hment is to&s;&s;ing, which is &s;o contrived that the victim falls immediately upon his head.&mdash;There were &s;everal per&s;ons about Sidi Mahomet, who from practice had acquired an habit of throwing per&s;ons up, &s;o as at plea&s;ure either to break the head, di&s;locate the neck, fracture an arm, leg, or both, or to let them fall without re|ceiving any material injury. When I was at Mo|rocco a man received the latter puni&s;hment in the morning, and in the afternoon the emperor made him a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent as a recompence for what he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>To &s;um up all in a few words, there is no mode of cruelty known which has not been practi&s;ed at Morocco.

The contrary of this I am afraid is too often the ca&s;e at Morocco.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT ten days after my interview with the emperor, Muley Ab&s;ulem arrived from Taru|dant, in his way to Mecca. As this prince was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a favourite with the emperor, his public entrance into Morocco was conducted in a much more magnificent &s;tile than any other part of the royal family would perhaps have ventured upon. As &s;oon as intelligence arrived that the prince was approaching the city, two of his bro|thers, Muley Slemma and Muley Ou&s;&s;ine, who happened to be at Morocco at the time, the Ba&s;haw, and all the principal per&s;ons in the city, received orders to proceed on hor&s;eback to meet him, which they did in great form, and found him encamped at the di&s;tance of about four miles. As &s;oon as he had dined, the cavalcade commenced, con&s;i&s;ting fir&s;t, of all the prince's Alcaides, about twelve in number, in front, flanked on each &s;ide by one &s;tandard-bearer, who carried each a red flag, and one lance-bearer, carrying a lance of an uncom|mon length. Behind them was Muley Ab&s;ulem in the centre; on the right of him Muley Slemma, and on the left Muley Ou&s;&s;ine. The next in order
<PB N="188" REF="027216_0196_0FD3CBC6A9CC60E0">
was the Ba&s;haw, with the principal per&s;ons of the city; and the rear was brought up by a troop of one hundred cavalry, all abrea&s;t, partly Negroes and partly Moors, who had the butt end of their mu&s;kets re&s;ting on their &s;addles, with the muzzles pointed perpendicularly. In this manner the prince advanced till he approached the walls of the town, where he received orders to halt till the emperor came to him; an honour which had never been paid by Sidi Mahomet to any per&s;on before. The emperor &s;hortly after advanced on hor&s;eback, with his &s;uite, con&s;i&s;ting of about fifty &s;oldiers. Upon his approach Muley Ab&s;ulem di&s;mounted and ki&s;&s;ed the earth; upon which the emperor commanded him to ri&s;e, and approach clo&s;e to his per&s;on. He then ble&s;&s;ed him, laying his hand on the prince's head, and afterwards embraced him with all the affection of a fond father. Having made many enquiries concerning his &s;on's health, the emperor took his leave, and each retired to their re&s;pective places of re&s;idence. As &s;oon as the prince had got within the walls of his garden, his troops fired three vollies of mu&s;|quetry in an irregular manner, as is cu&s;tomary on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and there the ceremony con|cluded.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be imagined, that I lo&s;t no time in waiting on his highne&s;s, and I received from him as flattering a reception as I could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h. The prince informed me that he had continued recovering his &s;ight gradually, and that he found him&s;elf in every other re&s;pect in good health. I took this opportunity of repre&s;enting to him how di&s;agreeably I was &s;ituated with re&s;pect to the
<PB N="189" REF="027216_0197_0FD3CBC9730003D8">
emperor, and tru&s;ted that he would now clear up every doubt that might have ari&s;en on my account; and with this reque&s;t he promi&s;ed to comply. On paying my &s;econd vi&s;it, the prince informed me that he had obtained the emperor's permi&s;&s;ion to have again recour&s;e to his medi|cines, and that he was certain he &s;hould have in|fluence &s;ufficient with his father to per&s;uade him to give me up the Engli&s;h captives, as a compli|ment for my &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The prince had brought along with him to Mo|rocco the Engli&s;h captain, the only Engli&s;hman that had been left in &s;lavery, the black having died &s;ome time before. My reader will ea&s;ily con|ceive the plea&s;ure I felt at &s;eeing my unfortunate countryman, who had been left alone in the hands of &s;avages, now out of immediate &s;lavery, and with the chearful pro&s;pect, according to the pro|mi&s;es of the prince, of being immediately &s;ent home to his friends and country. My &s;en&s;ations indeed on the occa&s;ion may be much more ea&s;ily felt than de&s;cribed. But if this circum&s;tance had &s;uch an effect upon me, what mu&s;t it have had upon this unfortunate officer, who for &s;ome months pa&s;t had been &s;eparated from his people, one of whom was a near relation, and without knowing whether they were dead or alive; who with the evils of &s;lavery had experienced that of a &s;evere fever, without having any per&s;on to con|&s;ole him, or afford him that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary upon &s;uch occa&s;ions? To be redeemed under &s;uch circum&s;tances from his inho&s;pitable &s;ituation, to recover from his illne&s;s, and to meet with all his companions at Morocco, well taken

<P>The captain was a well-informed young man, and an agreeable companion. He had been brought up, as I before intimated, to the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine and &s;urgery, in both of which he had received a good education. His fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in the world was as &s;urgeon to a Guinea-man; after having made &s;everal voyages in this capacity, how|ever, finding it a di&s;advantageous employment, he obtained the command of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el in the &s;ame trade, and this was his fir&s;t voyage as com|mander.</P>
<P>Contrary to his inclination he was ordered by his owners to &s;ail between the canaries and the coa&s;t of Africa, which is at all times con&s;idered as a dangerous navigation. As he approached towards the &s;pot where his misfortune happened, which is inhabited by wild Arabs, he got into a &s;trong current, which drives directly towards the &s;hore, and a perfect calm &s;ucceeding, the ve&s;&s;el unavoidably ran aground. The crew immediately took to their boat, carried off all the money on board, which was about five hundred dollars, with a good &s;hare of provi&s;ions and water, and got &s;afe to &s;hore.</P>
<P>The part of the country were they were wreck|ed con&s;i&s;ted of deep and heavy &s;ands. As upon their fir&s;t landing they &s;aw nothing to mole&s;t them, it was their intention to proceed on foot, along the coa&s;t to the northward, till they could reach Santa Cruz or Mogodore, where they could make their &s;ituation known. For this purpo&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="027216_0199_0FD3CBCBEB820BD8">
they &s;et off with their money, provi&s;ions and water, and met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;turbance till the end of two days. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erved a party of wild Arabs, armed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> large clubs and knives, and rapidly advancing towards them: their fir&s;t object was to bury their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oney in the &s;ands. Over|powered by numbers, they &s;aw no chance of making a &s;ucce&s;sful defence, and therefore every moment expected in&s;tantaneous death. The &s;a|vages, however, had a different object in view. They knew very well that what property the un|fortunate people had about them was &s;ufficiently &s;ecure, without being under the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;|troying their lives in order to obtain it, and they were not ignorant of the value of their per&s;ons when offered for &s;ale; their ultimate object there|fore was, to bring them to market as &s;laves.</P>
<P>As each of their conquerors conceived him&s;elf equally intere&s;ted in the capture, they were &s;ome time before they could agree among them|&s;elves how they &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of their pri&s;oners; in the mean time &s;ome of the people were knocked down, others had their pockets cut out, and the buttons torn from off their coats. They were at la&s;t &s;eized on by different per&s;ons, and carried away to different places of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>As I had an oportunity of &s;eeing &s;ome of the&s;e &s;avages at Morocco, and as they appeared to be in &s;ome re&s;pects different from tho&s;e Arabs whom I had met with in my travels, I &s;hall beg leave to de&s;cribe them. Contrary to the cu&s;tom of the Moors, they wear the hair long, which is a dark black, and &s;tarting from their heads like porcu|pine's quills. Their complexions are off a very
<PB N="192" REF="027216_0200_0FD3CBCD6BBD3078">
dark brown, their no&s;es very pointed, their eyes dark and &s;taring, their beards long, and their features altogether &s;ugge&s;t the idea of lunacy or raving madne&s;s. In their per&s;ons they are very &s;trong and mu&s;cular; and many of them go quite naked; others wear only a &s;mall garment round their wai&s;ts.&mdash;But to return to my narrative.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;ailors were put into mi&s;erable huts or tents, where for &s;everal days they could procure no &s;u&s;tenance, but juniper-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rries, braki&s;h water, and now and then a &s;mall quantity of milk.</P>
<P>From the&s;e people they were &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed of to others, who put them into the immediate em|ployments of &s;lavery; the&s;e employments were the carrying of water in &s;kins, and performing various other kinds of drudgery, which was at all times accompanied with &s;tripes.</P>
<P>After continuing in this &s;tate between two and three months, they contrived to get a letter con|veyed to the Engli&s;h vice con&s;ul at Mogodore, expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;ituation, who forwarded it to the con&s;ul general at Tangier, and at the &s;ame time wrote to Muley Ab&s;ulem upon the &s;ubject. This prince, who commanded the province ad|joining to that where Captain Irving and his people were detained, at the expiration of eight months from the time this accident happened, obtained the emperor's permi&s;&s;ion to redeem them out of &s;lavery, with orders to &s;end them up to Moroc|co, where his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty thought proper to keep them, till they were expre&s;sly &s;ent for by our &s;overeign; or, in other words, till he received an hand&s;ome pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="027216_0201_0FD3CBCF0F2BF8E0">About four days after the prince's arrival, the flattering a&s;&s;urances which he had at fir&s;t given me re&s;pecting the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons were ap|parently confirmed, by his informing me, that he had &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes with the emperor, in what he had promi&s;ed relative to the Engli&s;h captives; that in two or three days he was to &s;et off for Fez, in his way to Mecca, and that he was to take us all with him as far as Sallee, whence a party was to be di&s;patched to conduct us to Tangier.</P>
<P>Such agreeable intelligence, and from &s;uch authority, afforded me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes that my journey would yet end to my &s;atisfaction. I eagerly flew to the captain to acquaint him with it; but he &s;eemed too much accu&s;tomed to di&s;|appointments, to entertain any very &s;anguine ex|pectations from my information. I think, how|ever, his &s;pirits appeared &s;omewhat revived upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The day before the prince's departure I was de|&s;ired to &s;tate the number of mules which would be nece&s;&s;ary to convey my baggage; at the &s;ame time I was told, that in two days we were all to &s;et off. To my very great &s;urprize, however, on the &s;ame evening, I was for the fir&s;t time re|fu&s;ed permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the prince; an excu&s;e being made that he was then bu&s;y, and therefore wi&s;hed me to call in the morning. At the &s;ame time I &s;aw every preparation making for the journey, and was po&s;itively told that the prince was to de|part from Morocco the very next day.</P>
<P>As I could not help feeling unea&s;y and alarmed at this circum&s;tance, I repaired early in the morn|ing
<PB N="194" REF="027216_0202_0FD3CBD06743B260">
to the prince's habitation, to know the truth of what I had heard the day before; little enquiry, however, was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf was the baggage mules ready loaded; and, in addition to this circum&s;tance, I was informed, that the prince was to &s;et off in an hour's time.</P>
<P>It was in vain that I &s;ent in repeated me&s;&s;ages to the prince, reque&s;ting that he would permit me to &s;ee him. The only an&s;wer I could obtain was, that he was then engaged, and that I mu&s;t wait a little. Wearied out at length by the urgency of my &s;olicitations, a particular friend of his highne&s;s came out and told me, that the prince had &s;ent me ten hard dollars, with order to leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he garden immediately, as no per&s;on but the em|peror could &s;end me home.</P>
<P>Enraged at this unworthy treatment, I de&s;ired the Moor to acquaint the prince, that it was not money I wanted; I wi&s;hed him only to fulfil his engagement, and that till I had &s;ome pro&s;pect of that being accompli&s;hed, I would not &s;tir from the garden, unle&s;s compelled by force. The re|&s;ult of this me&s;&s;age was, that the &s;ame man re|turned with two dollars more, and &s;aid that the prince had done all he could for me. If I cho&s;e to go to one of the emperors &s;ecretaries, who&s;e name he mentioned, he would give me the em|peror's letter of di&s;patch, and then I might pro|ceed home in what manner I plea&s;ed, but that the prince had no further bu&s;ine&s;s with me Find|ing that me&s;&s;ages were fruitle&s;s, I determined to watch the oportunity of the prince's coming out of his hou&s;e, and as &s;oon as he had mounted his
<PB N="195" REF="027216_0203_0FD3CBEE289C06D0">
hor&s;e, I placed my&s;elf directly before him. In this la&s;t re&s;ource, however, I found my&s;elf equally un&s;ucce&s;sful as before, and experienced the la&s;t extreme of rudene&s;s and ingratitude; for before my interpreter could pronounce a &s;ingle &s;entence, the prince pu&s;hed on, and rode ha&s;tily by me, leaving me in as di&s;agreeable a &s;ituation as can well be conceived.</P>
<P>To whatever point I directed my view, there appeared nothing comfortable in the pro&s;pect. I had come purpo&s;ely into the country to attend the prince, with his mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances that I &s;hould be &s;ent back again, when he had no further occa&s;ion for my &s;ervices. How great then mu&s;t be my mortification to find my&s;elf in a wor&s;e &s;itua|tion than the crane in the fable? &s;ince in&s;tead of obtaining from him this negative favour, in return for all the fatigues and inconveniences which I had experienced on his account, I found my&s;elf de&s;erted entirely, and left in the charge of a haugh|ty and perfidious emperor! Doubt after doubt took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind; and this, joined with the reflection of having &s;o completely di&s;appointed the hopes of the unfortunate &s;eamen, as well as the favourable accounts I had written to the con|&s;ul on the prince's recovery, pre&s;&s;ed &s;o forcibly on my feelings, that for the &s;pace of two or three hours I was in a &s;tate little better than that of in|&s;anity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf in &s;ome degree re|covered, I went to the per&s;on to whom I was di|rected for my letter of di&s;patch, and was inform|ed that he had &s;et off early that morning for Fez, and had the further &s;ati&s;faction of di&s;covering that the prince had availed him&s;elf of this excu&s;e,
<PB N="196" REF="027216_0204_0FD3CBF0A76962D0">
in order to avoid my importunity. As no &s;tran|ger who is &s;ent for by the emperor can &s;tir from the court till he gets his di&s;patches, I now con|&s;idered my&s;elf in every re&s;pect a pri&s;oner. Di&s;ap|pointed in every hope of emancipation, I returned home, and immediately di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to the con&s;uls at Tangier and Mogodore, informing them of my &s;ituation, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ting their immediate interference. In the mean time I omit|ted no other means which occurred to procure my di&s;patches, but all without &s;ucce&s;s. The mo&s;t probable &s;tep which I could devi&s;e, or at lea&s;t which I could carry into effect, was to convey to the emperor's hands the following memorial, by means of one of his &s;ons.</P>

<P><PB N="197" REF="027216_0205_0FD3E1392288FCF8">I got the above letter tran&s;lated into Arabic, worded in the u&s;ual compliments of the country, and having inclo&s;ed it in a &s;ilk handkerchief, the mode in which all letters are pre&s;ented to royal per&s;onages in Barbary, and carried to Muley Omar, whom I had &s;een at Tarudant, with a pre|&s;ent of Iri&s;h linen, in value about &s;ix dollars, wrapped up al&s;o in a &s;ilk handkerchief; and re|que&s;ted him to deliver it into his father's hands the fir&s;t opportunity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN a fortnight after the prince's departure all the Engli&s;h captives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re ordered to Mogodore, to remain under the care of a gentleman of that place till our court &s;hould think proper to &s;end for them. Deprived by this circum&s;tance of the &s;ociety of the captain, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and agree|able conver&s;ation le&s;&s;ened in a great degree the unea&s;ine&s;s I experienced from the irk&s;omene&s;s of my &s;ituation, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;pirits did not receive much benefit from the change. My only re&s;ource at pre&s;ent for &s;ociety was the French of|ficer whom I formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>Limited as our &s;ociety was to that of each other, there exi&s;ted a further impediment to amu&s;ement; for we could not leave the jewdry without being &s;aluted with repeated &s;howers of &s;tones, oppro|brious names, and every in&s;ult that bigotry and brutality could devi&s;e. The ignorant of every nation are intolerant; and there can &s;carcely exi&s;t a more de&s;perate or &s;avage de&s;cription of people than the Lazzaroni of Morocco: they are a mixed
<PB N="199" REF="027216_0207_0FD3E13B188A1EA8">
race, con&s;i&s;ting of the ba&s;e&s;t of the citizens, with a number of ferocious mountaineers and wild Arabs, who have wandered thither in hopes of acquiring a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence either by labour or by theft.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription indeed of a mingled race will &s;till more exten&s;ively apply even to the more civi|lized inhabitants of this country. In the towns particularly, the de&s;cendants of the different tribes from which they are &s;prung may &s;till be traced, viz. tho&s;e of the native Moors, of their Turki&s;h conquerors, and of the negroes who have been in|troduced in the manner already related.</P>
<P>The complexion of the two fir&s;t is a &s;allow white, and from this circum&s;tance, and from their intermarrying with each other, it is not po&s;&s;ible always to determine the origin of each individual; I &s;hall therefore cla&s;s them both under the general appellation of Moors. But the negroes, though they form a large proportion of the emperor's &s;ub|jects, are now by no means &s;o numerous as in the reign of Muley I&s;hmael, who fir&s;t introduced them into the country. They are better formed than the Moors, and as they are more lively, daring, and active, they are intru&s;ted with an important &s;hare in the executive part of government. They con|&s;titute in fact the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the emperor's army, and are generally appointed to the command of provinces and towns.

<P>Be&s;ides the negroes which form the emperor's army, there are a great many others in the coun|try, who either are or have been &s;laves to private Moors: every Moor of con&s;equence, indeed, has his proportion of them in his &s;ervice. To the di&s;grace of Europe, the Moors treat their &s;laves with humanity, employing them in looking after their gardens, and in the dome&s;tic duties of their hou&s;es. They allow them to marry among them|&s;elves, and after a certain number of years &s;pon|taneou&s;ly pre&s;ent them with the invaluable boon of liberty.

<P>To think ju&s;tly and with candour of the Moori&s;h character we mu&s;t take into our con&s;ideration the natural effects of a total want of education, a mo&s;t rigidly arbitrary government, and a climate calculated, as far as climate has influence, to &s;ti|mulate and excite the vicious pa&s;&s;ions, as well as by its debilitating and relaxing influence to wea|ken and depre&s;s the nobler energies of the mind.

To the&s;e we may add the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from the want of a free intercour&s;e with other nations, and the influence of an ab&s;urd and un|charitable religion.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of things the traveller is not to be &s;urpri&s;ed if he finds mo&s;t of the vices of &s;a|vage nations grafted upon tho&s;e of luxury and indolence; if he ob&s;erves &s;uper&s;tition, avarice, and lu&s;t the leading features of character, with their natural concomitants, deceit and jealou&s;y; he is not to be &s;urprized if he finds but little of the amiable attachments and propen&s;ities, little of friend&s;hip or &s;ocial union with each other, &s;ince the nature of the government, and the habits of his private life, are calculated to in&s;pire each man with a di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion of his neighbour.</P>
<P>I will not a&s;&s;ert, however, that this character will univer&s;ally apply.&mdash;However the cu&s;toms and government of a nation may militate again&s;t virtue and excellence, there are always &s;plendid excep|tions to the prevalent vices of every &s;ociety. There are certainly among the Moors many who&s;e pri|vate virtues would do honour to any civilized na|tion; but I am &s;orry to add, that tho&s;e characters are not numerous. Groaning under the &s;evere&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions of de&s;poti&s;m, they lo&s;e all &s;pirit for indu&s;try and improvements, and &s;uffer indolence and ignorance to reign without controul. Sen|&s;ible of the uncertainty of enjoying the fruits of labour and ingenuity, the great majority of the people remain content with the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life, or when in power endeavour to enrich them&s;elves by the &s;ame means which had before kept them in a &s;tate of poverty.</P>

<P>Fearful of having it di&s;covered that they are rich, &s;ooner than part with money, which, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is of little or no u&s;e to them, they deprive them&s;elves of the luxuries and even comforts of life; they hoard up and conceal their trea&s;ures, though &s;eldom &s;o artfully but they are at length detected, and con&s;equently plundered by the ba&s;haw, the prince, or the emperor.

<P>The Moors are naturally of a grave and pen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition, fervid in profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, but very in&s;incere in their attachments. They have no curio&s;ity, no ambition of knowledge; an indolent habit, united to the want of mental culti|vation, renders them perhaps even more callous than other unenlightened people to every delicate &s;en&s;ation, and they require more than ordinary

excitement to render them &s;en&s;ible of plea&s;ure or of pain. It is to this circum&s;tance, and to their religion, which teaches them to impute every thing to a blind prede&s;tination, that we may attri|bute that pa&s;&s;ive obedience which the Moors di&s;|cover under all their misfortunes and oppre&s;&s;ions. This langour of &s;entiment is, however, unaccom|panied with the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of courage or for|titude. When in adver&s;ity they manife&s;t the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;uperiors, and in pro&s;|perity their tyranny and pride is in&s;upportable. They frequently &s;mile, but are &s;eldom heard to laugh loud.

<P>It has been &s;omewhere remarked, that whatever deba&s;es the human &s;pirit, corrupts and at the &s;ame time depraves the heart. That abjectne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which a &s;tate of &s;lavery induces, eradicates every noble, every generous &s;entiment. The Moors are di&s;honourable and unfair in all their dealings; nor are the greate&s;t among them exempt from propen&s;ities which would di&s;grace the meane&s;t of the civilized inhabitants of Europe. When the emperor's army was at Tangier, one of the con&s;uls invited the Moori&s;h general and his particular friend to tea. Soon after their depar|ture

<P>When we treat of national genius and charac|ter, it were to be wi&s;hed that language &s;upplied us with &s;ome term which might &s;erve to indicate that habit and cu&s;tom is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> framer of the characters of nations. Of this truth there can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;tronger evidence than Morocco affords. Torpid and in&s;en&s;ible as I have repre&s;ented the Moors in general to be, this character is by no means appli|cable to them in early life. In the &s;tate of child|hood they po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon &s;hare of vivacity and acutene&s;s, but they &s;ink gradually into indo|lence and &s;tupidity as they advance in life. It is evident, therefore, that to the want of education only this circum&s;tance is to be attributed. While at &s;chool they are &s;carcely le&s;s remarkable for at|tention than ability; and as they commit their le&s;|&s;ons to memory, no &s;mall &s;hare of application is required. This cour&s;e is, however, extremely limited, and continues for a very &s;hort period; it con&s;i&s;ts at mo&s;t of being in&s;tructed in certain parts of the Koran, and perhaps learning to write. After this all attention to learning cea&s;es; and though their parents never indulge them, yet they are rarely cha&s;ti&s;ed, and are left to them&s;elves in general almo&s;t in a &s;tate of nature.</P>

is that engine.</Q>&mdash;and to the want of it may fairly be attributed the ignorance, the &s;tupidity, the &s;lavery of the African nations. The art of printing is entirely prohibited and unknown in Barbary; and, from &s;ome inexplicable cau&s;e, mo&s;t of the manu&s;cripts which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their Saracen ance&s;tors are lo&s;t to the pre&s;ent genera|tion of Moors. A few indeed are &s;till in being, which treat of a&s;tronomy, a&s;trology, and phy&s;ic; but tho&s;e on a&s;trology only are are at pre&s;ent &s;tudied.</P>
<P>If any thing could effect an important and be|neficial change in the&s;e people, it would be the example of &s;ome great and magnanimous mo|narch, who by &s;ome &s;ingular revolution might be rai&s;ed to the throne of Morocco. In &s;o de&s;potic a government, where religion con&s;pires with ha|bit in teaching the &s;ubject to con&s;ider his prince as &s;omething more than man, much more might be effected by example, than in a free country; where the &s;overeign is merely con&s;idered as an in|dividual placed on the throne for the public good, &s;ubject to all the imperfections and frailties inci|dent to human nature, and where the mind, by being allowed a free &s;cope for reflection, di&s;dains all authority but that of rea&s;on and truth.</P>
<P>The plan adopted, however, for the education of the princes of Morocco, &s;o far from tending to the improvement of their minds, or the en|largement of their ideas, &s;erves on the contrary, too frequently to render them &s;till more remark|able for vice and bru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ity than even the wor&s;t of their &s;ubjects.

within the walls of the harem, they are taken out, and put under the care of one of their father's confidential Negroes, with whom they &s;oon form a clo&s;e intimacy, from whom they imbibe all the bad qualities which are in&s;eparable from a &s;tate of &s;lavery, and by whom they are al&s;o initiated in vices of every kind, in debauchery, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Their education extends no fur|ther than to read and write; and their knowledge of the world is confined to what they can ob|&s;erve and learn in the cour&s;e of a pilgrimage to Mecca. They are totally unacquainted with the political hi&s;tory of every foreign power; and their knowledge of their own government is confined principally to its wor&s;t parts. To acquaint them|&s;elves with the re&s;ources of the country, and the improvements which from its &s;ituation it would ad|mit of, or to direct any part of their attention to tho&s;e regulations in their government which might tend to the advantage and ea&s;e of their &s;ubjects, or to their own real aggrandizement, is as much out of the line of their education, as the Princi|pia of Newton. Thus they a&s;cend the throne with all the prejudices of ignorance, with all the vices of barbari&s;m, with a pride that teaches them to look upon their fellow creatures as inferior be|ings, and without any &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion, or true policy, to re&s;train the arm of de&s;poti&s;m from its mo&s;t cruel and fatal exce&s;&s;es. Thus ill-qualified in general are the &s;overeigns of Morocco for effecting a reformation in the man|ners and character of their people.</P>
<P>The ignorance of the Moors is, however, no bar to their loquacity. They &s;peak very loud,
<PB N="207" REF="027216_0215_0FD3E14F6BCD45A8">
and generally two or three at a time, as they are not very exact in waiting for a reply. U&s;ele&s;s as the forms of politene&s;s may appear in the eye of the philo&s;opher, there are &s;ome of them which probably conduce in no trifling degree to even our intellectual excellence and improvement.</P>
<P>Per&s;onal cleanline&s;s has been pointed out by modern philo&s;ophers as one of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which &s;erve to mark and determine the civilization of a people. It was in vain that Ma|homet enjoined the frequency of ablution as a re|ligious duty to the Moors. Their dre&s;s, which &s;hould be white, is but &s;eldom wa&s;hed, and their whole appearance evinces that they perform this branch of their religious ceremonies in but a &s;lovenly manner. With this degree of negligence as to their per&s;ons, we may be ju&s;tly &s;urpri&s;ed to find united a mo&s;t &s;crupulous nicety in their habi|tations and apartments. They enter their cham|bers barefooted, and cannot bear the &s;lighte&s;t de|gree of contamination near the place where they are &s;eated. This delicacy again is much confined to the in&s;ides of their hou&s;es. The &s;treets receive the whole of their rubbi&s;h and filth, and by the&s;e means the ground is &s;o rai&s;ed in mo&s;t parts of the city of Morocco, that the new buildings always &s;tand con&s;iderably higher than the old.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons of the Moori&s;h men are &s;o di&s;|gui&s;ed by their dre&s;s, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to ac|quire any good idea of their form or proportion. In height they are commonly above the middle &s;ize, and they are rather meagre than fat. Their complexions in general are &s;allow in the Northern parts of the empire, but are darker in proportion

to their &s;ituation towards the South. Their fea|tures have univer&s;ally a great &s;amene&s;s. Their eyes are black and full, they have an aquiline no&s;e, and in general a good &s;et of teeth.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dre&s;s, and general remarks on the Moori&s;h wo|men will be introduced hereafter, when we &s;peak of the emperor's harem.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hort linen &s;hirt, with large and loo&s;e &s;leeves hanging half|way down to the ground. A pair of loo&s;e linen drawers, reaching almo&s;t to the ankle; over which they wear another loo&s;e pair, made of woollen cloth. Over the &s;hirt they wear two or three woollen cloth wai&s;tcoats of different co|lours, and of European manufacture; the&s;e gar|ments are made full as loo&s;e as our great coats; they are connected before by very &s;mall buttons, and are fa&s;tened tight round the wai&s;t by a &s;ilk belt. Over the&s;e wai&s;tcoats they throw a velvet cord, which cro&s;&s;es the right &s;houlder, and &s;u&s;|pends on the left &s;ide a curved dagger or knife, &s;heathed in a bra&s;s ca&s;e. This is the dre&s;s the Moors wear when in their hou&s;es; but when they go abroad they cover it with the haick, a part of dre&s;s which has been already noticed. It is thrown over the whole of their other clothing in a care|le&s;s but ea&s;y manner, &s;omething &s;imilar to the Scotch plaid. When the weather is wet or cold, in&s;tead of the haick, the Moors &s;ub&s;titute the &s;ulam; which is a large hooded cloak, reaching to the heels, all of one piece, and made of blue or white woollen cloth of European manufacture, without &s;eams, clo&s;e before, and ornamented with
<PB N="209" REF="027216_0217_0FD3E152687285D0">
&s;ilk fringes at the extremities, on the brea&s;t, and the ends of the hood, terminating with a &s;ilk ta&s;|&s;el. The latter part of the dre&s;s is fixed on the head by means of a &s;trong cord of camel's hair; and among the common people it often &s;upplies the place of a cap or turban.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Moors who have performed a pilgrimage to Mecca are entitled to wear a turban, and are named El-hatch. They are always treated with peculiar re&s;pect. Even tho&s;e bea&s;ts of burden indeed which have performed this journey are held in great veneration, and upon their return are exempted from labour. The other cla&s;s of Moors wear only plain red caps. The Moors in general &s;have their heads clo&s;e, leaving on the upper part a &s;ingle lock, and wear their beards long. They u&s;e no &s;tockings or &s;hoes, but &s;ub&s;titute in the place of the latter, yellow &s;lippers. They are very fond of beads, of which the better order always carry a ro&s;ary in their hands; but they u&s;e them more as a matter of amu&s;ement than for any religi|ous purpo&s;e. Many al&s;o wear plain gold rings on their fingers and tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances will allow them to go to that expence, po&s;&s;e&s;s likewi&s;e watches, which, like the ro&s;ary they con&s;ider rather as an ornament than an article from which any great utility can be derived. Very few, in fact, are properly acquainted with their u&s;e.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve to give &s;ome idea of the dre&s;s of the rich; but among the poorer cla&s;s of peo|ple &s;ome wear the linen drawers, &s;hirt, and one woollen wai&s;tcoat, and over it the haick; and others have merely a coar&s;e woollen frock, belted round the wai&s;t, and covered with the haick.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="027216_0218_0FD3E154E9D7B350">The hou&s;es in mo&s;t of the towns in this empire appear at a little di&s;tance like vaulted tombs in a church-yard; and the entrance into the be&s;t of them has but a mean appearance. They are of a &s;quare form, their apartments are &s;eldom built higher than the ground floor, and their outer walls are univer&s;ally white-wa&s;hed, which, in the &s;treets and particularly when the &s;un is out, pro|duce a very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation to the eyes. All the&s;e circum&s;tances, united to the want of win|dows, the filthine&s;s and irregularity of the &s;treets, the dirty appearance and rude behaviour of the inhabitants, and their total ignorance of every art and &s;cience, leaves at fir&s;t &s;ight an unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the traveller, which perhaps while he continues in the country he can never do away. As the roofs of the hou&s;es are all terraces, they &s;erve as <HI>verandos,</HI> where the Moori&s;h woman commonly &s;it for the benefit of the air, and in &s;ome places it is po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s nearly over the whole town, without having oc|ca&s;ion to de&s;cend into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>As the be&s;t apartments are all backwards, a &s;table, or perhaps &s;omething wor&s;e, is the place to which vi&s;itors are fir&s;t introduced. Upon en|tering the hou&s;e the &s;tranger is either detained in this place, or in the &s;treet, till all the women are di&s;patched out of the way; he is then allowed to enter a &s;quare court, into which four narrow and long rooms open by means of large folding doors, which, as they have no windows, &s;erve likewi&s;e to introduce light into the apartments. The court has generally in its cente a fountain, and if it is the hou&s;e of a Moor of property, it is floored
<PB N="211" REF="027216_0219_0FD3E15616E11DE0">
with blue and white checquered tiling. The doors are u&s;ually painted of various colours in a checquered form, and the upper parts of them are frequently ornamented with very curious car|ved work.&mdash;None of the chambers have fire|places, and their victuals are always dre&s;&s;ed in the court-yard, in an earthen &s;tove, heated with charcoal.</P>
<P>When the vi&s;itor enters the room where he is received by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, he finds him &s;itting cro&s;s-legged and barefooted on a mattre&s;s, covered with fine white linen, and placed on the floor, or el&s;e on a common mat. This, with a narrow piece of carpetting, is in general the only furniture he will meet with in Moori&s;h hou&s;es; though they are not de&s;titute of other ornaments. In &s;ome, for in&s;tance, he will find the walls deco|rated with looking-gla&s;&s;es of different &s;izes. In others, watches and clocks in gla&s;s ca&s;es; and in &s;ome the apartments are hung with the &s;kins of lions or tigers&punc; or adorned with a di&s;play of mu&s;|kets and &s;abres. In the hou&s;es of tho&s;e who live in the very fir&s;t &s;tyle, an European mahogany bed|&s;tead, with one or two mattrr&s;&s;es, covered with fine white linen, is &s;ometimes placed at each end of the room. The&s;e, however, are only con&s;i|dered as ornaments, as the Moors always &s;leep on a matre&s;s, or a mat placed upon the floor and covered only with their haick, or perhaps a quilt.</P>
<P>As the law of Mahomet &s;trictly pro&s;cribes the u&s;e of pictures of every de&s;cription, this delightful &s;pecies of ornament finds no place in the hou&s;es of the Moors. I was however, acquainted with
<PB N="212" REF="027216_0220_0FD3E158A3374240">
a Moor at Morocco, who u&s;ed to exhibit a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aree-&s;how to his friends and acquaintance, all of whom appeared to expre&s;s infinite &s;urprize and admiration at his exhibition. This, indeed, was not the only in&s;tance in which he was guilty of violating the Mahometan law. He &s;crupled not to drink very freely his bottle of port or claret, which, as it was manufactured by Chri&s;tians, was from that circum&s;tance an aggravated offence. He employed me to procure for him from Mogodore three dozen of claret, which appeared to admini&s;ter to him infinite comfort and &s;atisfaction. This affection indeed for the productions of Europe made him perhaps more than u&s;ually favourable to its natives. However this may be, he was the only man who &s;howed me much attention during my re&s;idence at Morocco. He repeatedly took me to his hou&s;e, and made me little pre&s;ents of various kinds, which at that place proved very accept|able.</P>
<P>When a Moor receives his gue&s;ts he never ri&s;es from his &s;eat, but &s;hakes hands, enquires after their health, and de&s;ires them to &s;it down, either on a carpet or a cu&s;hion placed on the floor for that purpo&s;e. Whatever be the time of day, tea is then brought in on a tea-board with &s;hort feet. This is the highe&s;t compliment that can be offered by a Moor; for tea is a very expen&s;ive and &s;carce article in Barbary, and is only drank by the rich and luxurious. Their manner of pre|paring it is by putting &s;ome green tea, a &s;mall quantity of tan&s;ey, the &s;ame portion of mint, and a large portion of &s;ugar (for the Moors drink their tea very &s;weet) into the tea-pot at the &s;ame
<PB N="213" REF="027216_0221_0FD3E1592926D5F8">
time, and filling it up with boiling water. When the&s;e articles are infu&s;ed a proper time, the fluid is then poured into remarkably &s;mall cups of the be&s;t India china, the &s;maller the more genteel, without any milk, and, accompanied with &s;ome cakes or &s;weatmeats, it is handed round to the company. From the great e&s;teem in which this beverage is held by the Moors, it is generally drank by very &s;mall and &s;low &s;ips, that is flavour may be the longer enjoyed; and as they u&s;ually drink a con|&s;iderable quantity whenever it is introduced, this entertainment is &s;eldom fini&s;hed in le&s;s time than two hours.</P>
<P>The other luxuries of the Moors are &s;nuff, of which they are uncommonly fond, and &s;moaking tobacco, for which the greater part u&s;e wooden pipes about four feet in length, with an earthen bowl; but the princes or emperor generally have the bowls made of &s;olid gold. In&s;tead of the in|dulgence of opium, which, from the heavy duty impo&s;ed upon that article by the emperor, is too expen&s;ive to be u&s;ed by the Moors, they &s;ub&s;titute the Achicha, a &s;pecies of flax. This they powder and infu&s;e in water in &s;mall quantities. The Moors a&s;&s;ert, that it produces agreeable ideas, but own that when it is taken to exce&s;s it mo&s;t powerfully intoxicates. In order to produce this effect, they likewi&s;e mix with their tobacco an herb, named in this country Khaf, which by &s;moak|ing, occa&s;ions all the inebriating effects of the Achicha.

joyfully embrace every private opportunity of drinking both to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the hours for eating, the peo|ple of this country are remarkably regular. Very &s;oon after day-break they take their breakfa&s;t, which is generally a compo&s;ition of flour and water boiled thin, together with an herb which gives it a yellow tinge. The male part of the family eat in one apartment and the female in another. The children are not permitted to eat with their parents, but take their meals afterwards with the &s;ervants; indeed in mo&s;t other re&s;pects they are treated ex|actly as &s;ervants or &s;laves by their parents. The me&s;s is put into an earthen bowl, and brought in upon a round wooden tray. It is placed in the centre of the gue&s;ts, who &s;it cro&s;s-legged either on a mat or on the floor, and who form a circle for the purpo&s;e. Having previou&s;ly wa&s;hed them|&s;elves, a ceremony always performed before and after meals, each per&s;on with his &s;poon attacks vigorou&s;ly the bowl, while they diver&s;ify the en|tertainment by eating with it fruit or bread. At twelve o'clock they dine, performing the &s;ame ceremonies as at breakfa&s;t. For dinner, from the emperor down to the pea&s;ant, their di&s;h is univer|&s;ally Cu&s;co&s;oo, the mode of preparing which has been already de&s;cribed. I believe I have intimated more than once that neither chairs, tables, knives or forks, are made u&s;e of in this country. The di&s;h is therefore brought in upon a round tray and placed on the floor, round which the family &s;it as at breakfa&s;t, and with their fingers commit a violent a&s;&s;ault on its contents; they are at the
<PB N="215" REF="027216_0223_0FD3E16221C510B8">
&s;ame time, however, attended by a &s;lave or do|me&s;tic, who pre&s;ents them with water and a towel occa&s;ionally to wa&s;h their hands. From the want of the &s;imple and convenient invention of knives and forks, it is not uncommon in this country to three or four people pulling to pieces the &s;ame piece of meat, and afterwards with their fingers &s;tirring up the pa&s;te or Cu&s;co&s;oo, of which the of|ten take a whole handful at once into their mouth. Their manner of eating indeed was to me &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ting, that though Cu&s;co&s;oo is in reality a very good di&s;h, yet it required &s;ome time to get rid of my prejudice &s;o far as to be induced to reli&s;h it. At &s;un-&s;et they &s;up upon the &s;ame di&s;h, and indeed &s;upper is their principal meal.</P>
<P>Such is the general mode of living among the principal people in towns. There are con&s;ider|able multitudes, however, who do not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;o well, but are obliged to content them&s;elves with a little bread and fruit in&s;tead of animal food, and to &s;leep in the open &s;treets. This kind of exi&s;tence &s;eems ill calculated to endure even in an inactive &s;tate; far more &s;evere mu&s;t it therefore be to tho&s;e who exerci&s;e the laborious employment of couriers in this country, who travel on foot a journey of three or four hundred miles, at the rate of between thirty and forty miles a day, without taking any other nouri&s;hment than a little bread, a few figs, and &s;ome water, and who have no better &s;helter at night than a tree. It is wonderful with what alacrity and per&s;everance the&s;e people perform the mo&s;t fatiguing journies at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. There is a regular company of them in every town, who are ready to be di&s;patched at a mo|ment's

warning to any part of the country their employers may have occa&s;ion to &s;end them. They con&s;titute in this empire the only mode of con|veyance for all public and private di&s;patches; and as they are well known in the place to which they belong, they are very punctual in delivering every thing that is put into their hands. From their &s;teady pace in travelling, at the rate of about four miles an hour, and from their being able to pa&s;s over parts which from the mountainous &s;tate of the country, and from the want of good roads, per&s;ons on hor&s;eback would find inacce&s;&s;ible, they are indeed by far the mo&s;t expeditious me&s;&s;engers that could be employed. As a proof of the a|mazing exertions of which they are capable, I need only mention, that there have been repeated in&s;tances of a courier proceeding from Morocco to Tangier, which is a journey of about three hundred and thirty miles, in &s;ix days.</P>
<P>As none but the very vulgar go on foot in this country; for the purpo&s;e of vi&s;iting, mules are con&s;idered as more genteel than hor&s;es; and the greate&s;t pride of a Moor is to have &s;uch as walk remarkably fa&s;t, and keep his footmen, of which the number is proportionable to the rank and con|&s;equence of the ma&s;ter, on a continued run.</P>
<P>As the Moors are not fond of admitting men into their hou&s;es, except upon particular occa&s;ions, if the weather is fine they place a mat, and &s;ome|times a carpet, on the ground before their door, &s;eat them&s;elves upon it cro&s;s-legged, and receive their friends, who form a circle, &s;itting in the &s;ame manner, with their attendants on the out|&s;ide of the groupe. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions they
<PB N="217" REF="027216_0225_0FD3E16450253590">
either drink tea, or &s;moke and conver&s;e. The &s;treets are &s;ometimes crowded with parties of this kind; &s;ome engaged at playing at an inferior kind of che&s;s or drafts, at which they are very expert; but the majority in conver&s;ation. The people of this country, indeed, are &s;o decidedly aver&s;e to &s;tanding up, or walking about, that if only two or three people meet, they &s;quat them&s;elves down in the fir&s;t clean place they can find, if the con|ver&s;ation is to hold but for a few minutes.</P>
<P>At Morocco, when I vi&s;ited Muley Ou&s;&s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, one of Sidi Mahomet's &s;ons, I was always received in the mainner which I have now de&s;cribed. I found him &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a common mat, in the &s;ame open place where his hor&s;es were kept, and his friends forming a &s;emicircle round him. I was immediately de&s;ired to form one of the groupe, and was helped to tea upon the occa&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, the prince told me, that the Chri&s;tians and Moors were brothers; that the Engli&s;h were very good men; but that he had a particular aver&s;ion to the friars, for they were a determined &s;et of knaves, and were neither friends to Chri&s;tians or Moors.</P>
<P>I found this prince a hand&s;ome young man, of about the age of &s;ix-and-twenty, of rather a dark complexion, but accompanied with an open and generous countenance. He had been a few years ago appointed to the government of Tafilet, where he &s;o far gained the affections of the people under his government, that they proclaimed him king; and he for &s;ome time governed with all the independent authority of a &s;overeign. This cir|cum&s;tance obliged the emperor to di&s;patch an army

again&s;t him, upon the arrival of which he im|mediately &s;urrendered, and was brought to Mo|rocco, where he was deprived of all his property, as well as his power; and when I was in the country, he lived in a very retired manner indeed. When at Tafilet, he had the character of acting very liberally towards every per&s;on with whom he was connected; at Morocco he manife&s;ted &s;ome proofs of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition towards me: merely for a trifling attention which I &s;hewed to his favourite black, he pre&s;ented me with a hor&s;e, that proved as good as any of which I had po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion while in the country.</P>
<P>The only vice to which this young man was ad|dicted was that of drinking to a very great exce&s;s. In this re&s;pect, however, he was not more cul|pable than all the re&s;t of his royal brothers. He told me, that if he did not daily take before dinner &s;ix tumblers of aquadent, a &s;pecies of brandy &s;omething weaker than &s;pirits of wine, he would not be able to hold up his head the remainder of the day. He wi&s;hed to know if this cu&s;tom was bad for his health; and if &s;o, what I would advi&s;e him to do. I recommended to him the di&s;|u&s;e of &s;pirits, and to &s;upply their place with wine; which he might either procure from the European merchants at Mogodore, or he might u&s;e the wine which was made by the Jews. This advice, however, the prince ob&s;erved he could not follow, &s;ince the Mahometan law more par|ticularly forbade the u&s;e of wine, than that of &s;pirits. This, I replied, might be true, in the &s;trict letter of the law; but when wine was u&s;ed as a medicine, it became no longer wine. This

idea I found &s;atisfied the &s;cruples of the prince, and he promi&s;ed to follow my advice.</P>
<P>I was afterwards &s;ent for to Muley Slemma, another of the emperor's &s;ons, who with the late emperor Muley Yazid, were the offspring of a woman who&s;e parents were Engli&s;h. This prince, who is about thirty-eight years of age, and of a tall and maje&s;tic appearance, with a very expre&s;|&s;ive and lively countenance, &s;hewed me uncom|mon attention the whole time I was at Morocco. His pavillion, where he received &s;trangers, and tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s, was &s;ituated at the extremity of a long walk, in a garden of orange-trees. It con&s;i&s;ted of one large room on the ground floor, fitted up in the &s;ame &s;tile as that of Muley Ab&s;ulem at Tarudant. The prince was &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a large mattre&s;s, covered with fine white linen, and placed on the floor fronting the door-way, with his Moori&s;h vi&s;itors on each &s;ide of him, forming a &s;emicircle. Upon my fir&s;t introduction he expre&s;&s;ed uncommon plea&s;ure at &s;eeing me, exclaiming, <HI>Bono, Bono, Anglai&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!</HI> and added, that the Engli&s;h were his brothers and be&s;t friends. I was then directed to feel his pul&s;e, and to inform him whether or not he was in health; as &s;oon as I a&s;&s;ured him he was perfectly well, he de&s;ired me to be &s;eated on a narrow carpet, which was placed on the floor for the purpo&s;e, and he then ordered one of his pages to bring in tea, though &s;o late as twelve o'clock at noon. Out of compliment to me, for the Moors &s;eldom u&s;e it, the prince &s;ent for milk, and &s;aid, as he knew the Engli&s;h always drank it with their tea, he would pre&s;ent me with a milch cow, that I might enjoy the cu&s;tom of
<PB N="220" REF="027216_0228_0FD3E169EC3BD270">
my own country. This promi&s;e, however, en|tirely e&s;caped his royal highne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s memory, and the cow never made her appearance.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, the prince manife&s;ted many indications of good-nature and addre&s;s; told me, that whil&s;t he was on his travels in Turkey, he had been conducted from one port to another in the Mediterranean by an Engli&s;h frigate, the captain of which &s;howed him &s;o much attention, that he &s;hould always bear it in re|membrance. As &s;oon as the ceremony of tea was concluded, the prince ordered out his hor&s;e, which was a very beautiful young animal, with a &s;addle ornamented with a rich velvet cover, and gold &s;tir|rups. He then mounted him, and went through all the manoeuvers of managing a hor&s;e with which the moors are acquainted, &s;uch as putting him upon the full &s;peed, and &s;topping him in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly, ri&s;ing up on the &s;addle and firing a mu&s;ket when the hor&s;e is on the full gallop, &amp;c. in the performance of all which exerci&s;es he &s;eem|ed very dexterous. The prince then a&s;ked me if we could do &s;uch things in England; and with|out waiting for a reply, ordered one of his at|tendants to catch a &s;heep out of his grounds, and take it home to my lodgings. He &s;aid, that as he always was fond of &s;eeing his brothers the Engli&s;h, he wi&s;hed I would vi&s;it him twice a day during my continuance at Morocco, and then gallopped off.&mdash;But to return to my ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>The manner of &s;alutation among the Moors is, when two equals meet, by a quick motion they &s;hake hands, and afterwards ki&s;s each each
<PB N="221" REF="027216_0229_0FD3E16CF91DAC70">
other's hand. When an inferior meets a &s;uperior, &s;uch as an officer of rank, a judge, or a governor, he ki&s;&s;es that part of his Haick which covers the arm, and &s;ometimes, as a higher mark of re&s;pect, he will ki&s;s his feet. But the compliment due to the emperor, or any of the princes of the blood, is to take off the cap or turban, and to pro&s;trate the head to the ground. When two particular friends or relations meet, they anxiou&s;ly embrace and ki&s;s each other's faces and beards for a few minutes, make a number of enquiries about the health of each party, as well as that of their families, but &s;eldom allow time for a reply.</P>
<P>The common topics for conver&s;ation among the&s;e people, are the occurrences of the place, religion, their women, and their hor&s;es. As curio&s;ity is a quality which naturally attaches to all indolent people, it may ea&s;ily be conjectured that the Moors are not deficient in this re&s;pect. It is incredible with what avidity they lay hold of any trifling circum&s;tance which may occur in the neighbourhood; what plea&s;ure and what pride they &s;een to take in communicating it, nor are they deficient in the arts of magnifying or adorn|ing the tale with every addition which may &s;erve to render it more palatable, or give it a greater appearance of plau&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Religion is al&s;o a favourite topic; but this &s;ubject is confined principally to tho&s;e &s;ocieties which are frequented by their Talbs, or men of letters. As the&s;e gentlemen, however, are not a litter proud of their acquirements in reading and writing, they do not fail to embrace every opportunity of manife&s;ting their &s;uperiority over
<PB N="222" REF="027216_0230_0FD3E16E14F5AD48">
tho&s;e who are not &s;o happy as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Decency of manners and delicacy in conver&s;a|tion are among the mo&s;t certain marks of refine|ment and civilization, and the contrary vices are equally univer&s;al characteri&s;tics of ignorance and barbari&s;m. The conver&s;ation of the Moors con|cerning their women is of the mo&s;t trifling and di&s;gu&s;ting de&s;cription, and con&s;i&s;ts of ab&s;urd and vulgar ob&s;ervations, equally repugnant to decency and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject, however, on which, like our young men of fa&s;hion in England, they appear mo&s;t calculated to &s;hine, is their hor&s;es. It would indeed be truly di&s;graceful not to be accompli&s;hed upon this topic, &s;ince it appears to occupy, both day and night, by far the greate&s;t portion of their attention. I have formerly intimated that the&s;e animals are &s;eldom kept in &s;tables in Morocco. They are watered and fed only once a day, the former at one o'clock at noon, and the latter at &s;un-&s;et; and the only mode which they u&s;e to clean them, is by wa&s;hing then all over in a river two or three times a week, and &s;uffering them to dry them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the attachment which the Moors manife&s;t to their hor&s;es, they mo&s;t certain|ly u&s;e them with great cruelty. Their highe&s;t plea&s;ure, and one of their fir&s;t accompli&s;hments, is, by means of long and &s;harp &s;purs to make the hor&s;e go full &s;peed, and then to &s;top him in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly; and in this they certainly manife&s;t uncommon dexterity. The iron-work of their bridles is &s;o con&s;tructed that by its pre&s;&s;ure on the
<PB N="223" REF="027216_0231_0FD3E16E1FE96348">
hor&s;e's tongue and lower jaw, with the lea&s;t exer|tion of the rider it fills his mouth full of blood, and if not u&s;ed with the utmo&s;t caution throws him inevitably on his back. The bridle has only a &s;ingle rein, which is &s;o very long that it &s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the purpo&s;e of both whip and bridle. The Moori&s;h &s;addle is in &s;ome degree &s;imilar to the Spani&s;h, but the pummel is &s;till higher and more peaked. Their &s;tirrups, in which they ride very &s;hort, are &s;o formed as to cover the whole of the foot. They either plate or gild them, according to the dignity, opulence, or fancy of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or. Their &s;addles, which are covered with red woollen cloth, or, if belonging to a per&s;on of con&s;equence, with red &s;atin or dama&s;k, are fa&s;tened with one &s;trong girth round the body, in the European &s;tyle, and another round the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The Moors frequently amu&s;e them&s;elves by riding with the utmo&s;t apparent violence again&s;t a wall; and a &s;tranger would conceive it impo&s;&s;ible for them to avoid being da&s;hed to pieces, when ju&s;t as the hor&s;e's head touches the wall, they &s;top him with the utmo&s;t accuracy. To &s;trangers on hor&s;eback or on foot it is al&s;o a common &s;pecies of compliment to ride violently up to them, as if intending to trample them to pieces, and then to &s;top their hor&s;es &s;hort and fire a mu&s;quet in their faces. This compliment I have experienced, and could very well have di&s;pen&s;ed with their polite|ne&s;s. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, they are very proud in di&s;covering their dexterity in hor&s;eman&s;hip, by making the animal rear up, &s;o as almo&s;t to throw him on his back, putting him immediately
<PB N="224" REF="027216_0232_0FD3E16E2DA5AF28">
after on the full &s;peed for a few yards, then &s;top|ping him in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and all this is accom|panied by loud and hollow cries.</P>
<P>There is another favourite amu&s;ement, which di&s;plays perhaps &s;uperior agility:&mdash;A number of per&s;ons on hor&s;eback &s;tart at the &s;ame moment, and accompanied with loud &s;houts, gallop at full &s;peed to an appointed &s;pot, when they &s;tand up &s;traight in the &s;tirrups, put the rein, which I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved is very long, in their mouths, level their pieces and fire them off; throw their fire-locks immediately over their right &s;houlders, and &s;top their hor&s;es nearly at the &s;ame in&s;tant. This I am told, is their manner of engaging in an action.</P>
<P>Though I am willing to allow the Moors the merit of &s;itting a hor&s;e well, and, as far as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the above-mentioned exerci&s;e, of having a great command over him, yet their hor&s;es are ill-bred, and they entirely neglect to teach them tho&s;e paces which in Europe are con&s;idered as the mo&s;t agreeable for the common purpo&s;es of riding. As none of the&s;e animals in Morocco are geldings, and as the Moors are unacquainted with the u&s;e of the ring, they are obliged to break them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> when very young, by taking them long and fatiguing journies, particularly over the moun|tainous and rocky part of the country, where they &s;oon reduce their &s;pirit; they then take the opportunity of teaching them to rear up, &s;tand fire, gallop, and &s;top &s;hort in the manner already related; and having accompli&s;hed this they are &s;atisfied without any farther qualification. For this rea&s;on a Barbary hor&s;e &s;eldom can perform
<PB N="225" REF="027216_0233_0FD3E17213CCF458">
any other pace than a full gallop or a walk; and from being broken in and worked hard before they have acquired their full &s;trength, the&s;e hor&s;es in a very few years become unfit for &s;ervice. The Moors &s;eldom ride the mares, but keep them in the country for breeding; and, contrary to the general opinion in Europe, they con&s;ider them &s;o much more valuable than hor&s;es, that they are never permitted to be exported.</P>
<P>Like all barbarous nations, the Moors are pa&s;|&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, and &s;ome few have a ta&s;te for poetry. Their &s;low airs, for want of that va|riety which is introduced when the &s;cience has at|tained a degree of perfection, have a very melan|choly &s;amene&s;s; but &s;ome of their quick tunes are beautiful and &s;imple, and partake in &s;ome degree of the characteri&s;tic melody of the Scotch airs. The poetry of their &s;ongs, the con&s;tant &s;ubject of which is love, though there are few nations per|haps who are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of that pa&s;&s;ion, has cer|tainly le&s;s merit than the mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Their in&s;truments are a kind of hautboy which differs from ours only in having no keys; the mand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">line, which they have learnt to play upon from their neighbours the Spaniards; another in&s;trument bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to a violin, and played upon in a &s;imilar manner, but with only two &s;trings; the large drum, the common pipe, and the tabor. The&s;e united and accompa|nied with a certain number of voices, upon many occa&s;ions form a band, though &s;olo mu&s;ic is more common in this un&s;ocial country.</P>
<P>Upon all days of rejoicing, this kind of mu&s;ic, repeated vollies of mu&s;quetry, either by men on hor&s;eback or on foot, and in the evening a grand
<PB N="226" REF="027216_0234_0FD3E1729380DFC8">
attack upon the Cu&s;co&s;oo, con&s;titute the principal part of the public entertainments. Mountebanks and jugglers al&s;o of every de&s;cription meet with great encouragement from the Moors.</P>
<P>There are no other places of reception for the accommodation of travellers in this country ex|cept in their Fondaks, which are only to be met with in large towns. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of a certain num|ber of dirty apartments, with no other accommoda|tion whatever, but the walls and roof, to protect the &s;tranger from the inclemency of the weather; and he mu&s;t furni&s;h him&s;elf with every article of which he may be in want, both in re&s;pect to pro|vi&s;ions and bedding. There is at the &s;ame time, an open court, where the hor&s;es of all travellers are intermixed.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the towns there are regular &s;chools, where tho&s;e children who&s;e parents have the means of doing it, and have &s;en&s;e enough to &s;end them (which indeed are but few in proportion to the whole) are in&s;tructed by the Talbs in reading and writing, and &s;ometimes in the fir&s;t rules of arithmetic&punc; The greater part of the people, how|ever, learn very little more than to read a few prayers &s;elected from the Koran, which are in common u&s;e, and are written in Arabic characters&punc; on paper which is pa&s;ted on a board.</P>
<P>To &s;peak particularly on the religion of the Moors would require a volume, and &s;uch a vo|lume as would certainly be more exten&s;ive than entertaining. It is well known they profe&s;s the Mahometan faith, and I may add, that they attend very rigidly to all the bigotry and &s;uper&s;tion which is peculiar to that religion.</P>

If they are near a mo&s;que they perform their devo|tions within it, otherwi&s;e immediately on the &s;pot where they happen to be, and always with their faces towards the Ea&s;t, in honour of the prophet Mahomet, who, it is well known was buried at Medina. The prayer which is generally repeated on the&s;e occa&s;ions is a chapter from the Koran, acknowledging the goodne&s;s of God and Maho|met, and it is accompanied with various ge&s;tures, &s;uch as lifting the hands above the head, bowing twice, performing two genuflexions, bowing again twice, and ki&s;&s;ing the ground. The whole of this ceremony they repeat three times.</P>
<P>Their &s;abbath is on our Friday, and commences from &s;ix o'clock the preceding evening. On this day they u&s;e a blue flag in&s;tead of the white one. As it has been prophe&s;ied that they are to be con|quered by the Chri&s;tians on the &s;abbath day, the gates of all the towns and of the emperor's palaces are &s;hut when at divine &s;ervice on that day, in order to avoid being &s;urpri&s;ed during that period.

The fir&s;t, which is named Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Cabier, is held in commemoration of the birth of Mahomet.

Although this fea&s;t only la&s;ts a &s;ingle day, yet it is celebrated with far greater magni|ficence than either of the others.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom among the Moors, when any thing of moment is to be undertaken, &s;uch as going on a dangerous journey or voyage, the di&s;po&s;al of their children in mar|riage, &amp;c. for &s;ome grave per&s;on to make an har|rangue to the multitude, upon which his auditors call for the key of direction. By this is meant the performance of joining the hands, looking &s;teadfa&s;tly on the palms during the admonition,

The due performance of this ceremony, they conceive will en&s;ure them certain &s;ucce&s;s in all their undertakings.</P>
<P>The Moors compute time by lunar months, and count the days of the week by the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, &amp;c. beginning from our Sunday. They u&s;e a common reed for writing, and begin their manu&s;cripts from right to left.</P>
<P>The Moors marry very young, many of their females not being more than twelve years of age at their nuptials. As Mahometans, it is well known that their religion admits of polygamy to the extent of four wives, and as many concubines as they plea&s;e; but if we except the very opulent, the people &s;eldom avail them&s;elves of this indul|gence, &s;ince it entails on them a va&s;t additional expence in hou&s;e-keeping and in providing for a large family. Whatever in&s;titution is contrary to truth and &s;ound morality will in practice refute it&s;elf; nor is any further argument than this &s;ingle ob&s;ervation wanting to an&s;wer all the ab&s;urdities which have been advanced in favour of a plurality of wives. In contracting marriage the parents of both parties are the only agents, and the intended bride and bridegroom never &s;ee each other till the ceremony is performed. The marriage &s;ettlements are made before the Cadi, and then the friends of the bride produce her portion, or if not, the hu&s;|band agrees to &s;ettle a certain &s;um upon her, in in ca&s;e he &s;hould die, or divorce her on account of
<PB N="231" REF="027216_0239_0FD3E17C0DD3EEA8">
barrenne&s;s, or any other cau&s;e. The children of the wives have all an equal claim to the effects of the father and mother, but tho&s;e of the concubines can each only claim half a &s;hare.</P>
<P>When the marriage is finally agreed upon, the bride is kept at home eight days, to receive her female friends, who pay congratulatory vi&s;its every day. At the &s;ame time a Talb attends upon her, to conver&s;e with her relative to the &s;olemn engage|ment on which &s;he is about to enter; on the&s;e occa&s;ions he commonly accompanies his admoni|tions with &s;inging a pious hymn, which is adapted to the &s;olemnity. The bride also with her near relations go through the ceremony of being paint|ed afre&s;h; the nature of which cu&s;tom I &s;hall de&s;cribe when I &s;peak of the harem.</P>
<P>During this proce&s;s the bridegroom on the other hand receives vi&s;its from his male friends in the morning, and in the evening rides through the town accompanied by them, &s;ome playing on hautboys and drums, while others are employed in firing volleys of mu&s;quetry&punc; In all their fe&s;ti|vals the di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry indeed forms a principal part of the entertainment. Contrary to the European mode, which particularly aims at firing with exactne&s;s, the Moors di&s;charge their pieces as irregularly as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to have a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of reports for a few minutes.</P>
<P>On the day of marriage, the bride in the evening is put into a square or octagonal cage, about twelve feet in circumference, which is covered with fine white linen, and &s;ometimes with gauzes and &s;ilks of various colours. In this ve|hicle which is placed on a mule, &s;he is paraded

He is then at liberty to marry again in two months.</P>
<P>At the birth of a child, it is cu&s;tomary for the parents to grieve eight days, at the expiration of which they &s;acrifice a goat or a &s;heep, and in|vite their friends and acquaintance to partake of the fea&s;t. Women &s;uffer but little inconvenience in this country from child-bearing; they are fre|quently up the next day, and go through all the duties of the hou&s;e with the infant on their backs. They do not adopt the method of teaching their children to walk which is cu&s;tomary in Europe, but when they are twelve months old they put them on the floor, where from fir&s;t crawling they naturally in a &s;hort time acquire the habit of walk|ing, and as &s;oon as they can be made in the lea&s;t degree u&s;eful, they are put to the various kinds of labour adapted to their age and &s;trength. Others, who&s;e parents are in better circum&s;tances, are, as I before ob&s;erved, &s;ometimes &s;ent to &s;chool; and tho&s;e who are intended for the church u&s;ual|ly continue their &s;tudies till they have nearly
<PB N="234" REF="027216_0242_0FD3E17FDA1F1E58">
learnt the Koran by rote. In that ca&s;e they are enrolled among the Talbs or learned men of the law; and upon leaving &s;chool are paraded round the &s;treets on a hor&s;e, accompanied by mu&s;ic and a large concour&s;e of people. The proce&s;&s;ion is conducted in the following manner. Upon the day appointed, one of the mo&s;t &s;hewy hor&s;es in the place is procured for the youth to ride on, who if he is a per&s;on of con&s;equence, is dre&s;t in all the gaiety which &s;ilks and brocades can afford, wearing a turban richly ornamented with gold and jewels, and inter&s;per&s;ed with flowers. Thus ar|rayed, he mounts his hor&s;e, which al&s;o is not with|out its decorations, carrying in his hand his pray|ers pa&s;ted on a board, on which he looks with &s;tedfa&s;t attention; and he proceeds with all the &s;edatene&s;s and compo&s;ed gravity of old age to the different places appointed for the purpo&s;e, ac|companied by mu&s;ic, and all his &s;chool-fellows on hor&s;eback, dre&s;&s;ed according to their circum|&s;tances. At la&s;t they meet at the hou&s;e of the head boy of the &s;chool, where they are treated with a collection of &s;weatmeats. This cu&s;tom, which is evidently adopted with a view of pro|moting an emulation in their youths, is one of the very few good in&s;titutions which are ob&s;ervable among the&s;e people.</P>
<P>In celebrating the rite of circumci&s;ion, the child is dre&s;&s;ed very &s;umptuou&s;ly and carried on a mule, or, if the parents are in poor circum&s;tances, on an a&s;s, accompanied with flags flying and mu&s;icians playing on hautboys and beating drums. In this manner they proceed to the mo&s;que, where the ceremony is performed.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="027216_0243_0FD3E180D118B198">When any per&s;on dies, a certain number of women are hired for the purpo&s;e of lamentation (for the men are &s;eldom ob&s;erved to weep for the lo&s;s of a friend) in the performance of which no|thing can be more grating to the ear, or more unplea&s;ant, than their frightful moans or rather howlings: at the &s;ame time the&s;e mercenary mourn|ers beat their heads and brea&s;ts, and tear their checks with their nails. The bodies are u&s;ually buried a few hours after death. Previous to in|terment the corp&s;e is wa&s;hed very clean, and &s;ew|ed up in a &s;hroud compo&s;ed of &s;even pieces of fine linen united together, with the right hand under the head, which is pointed towards Mecca; it is carried on a bier &s;upported upon men's &s;houlders to the burying-place, which is always, with great propriety, on the out&s;ide of the town, for they never bury their dead in the mo&s;ques or within the bounds of an inhabited place. The bier is accompanied by numbers of people, two a|brea&s;t, who walk very fa&s;t, calling upon God and Mahomet, and &s;inging hymns adapted to the occa&s;ion. The grave is made very wide at the bottom, and narrow at the top, and the body is depo&s;ited without any other ceremony than &s;inging and praying in the &s;ame manner as on their way to the grave.</P>
<P>They have no tombs in this country, but long and plain &s;tones; and it is frequently cu&s;tomary for the female friends of the departed to weep over their graves for &s;everal days after the funeral. The Moors will not allow Chri&s;tians or Jews to pa&s;s over their places of interment; as they have a &s;uper&s;titious idea, which is perhaps more pre|valent

among the lower cla&s;s of people, than tho&s;e who are better informed, that the dead &s;uffer pain from having their graves trodden upon by infidels; and I recollect when at Tangier, I re|ceceived a very &s;evere rebuke from a Moor, for accidentally having pa&s;&s;ed through one of their burying grounds.</P>
<P>When a women lo&s;es her hu&s;band &s;he mourns four months and eight days, during which period &s;he is to wear no &s;ilver or gold; and if &s;he hap|pens to be pregnant, &s;he is to mourn till &s;he is brought to bed. For the above time the relations of her late hu&s;band are obliged to &s;upport her. I could not learn that any mourning was due from the hu&s;band for the lo&s;s of his wife; but it is cu&s;tomary, particularly among the great people, for a &s;on to mourn for his father by not &s;having his head or any part of his beard, and by not cutting his nails for a certain period.</P>
<P>When a Jew or a Chri&s;tian is converted to the Mahometan faith, he is immediately dre&s;&s;ed in a Moori&s;h habit, and paraded round the &s;treets on hor&s;eback, accompanied with mu&s;ic and a great concour&s;e of people. He then chu&s;es him&s;elf a Moori&s;h name, and fixes on a per&s;on who adopts him as a child, and is ever afterwards called his father. This adoption, however, is only nominal, for he is by no means bound to &s;upport him. The new convert is not allowed to marry any other woman than a negro, or the daughter of a renegado; and his de&s;cendants are not con|&s;idered as genuine Moors till the fourth genera|tion.</P>

<P>Seven Months before the fea&s;t Aid de Cabier, or the commemoration of the birth of Mahomet, pilgrims from every quarter a&s;&s;emble at Fez, in order to join the caravan which at that &s;ea&s;on proceeds for Mecca.

Thus religion and intere&s;t con&s;pire to draw together a large and motely groupe, and to induce them to undertake a journey which is as fatiguing and dangerous as it is expen&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="027216_0246_0FD3E1E2E70885F0">The fir&s;t cla&s;s are not required to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to join the caravan. The &s;econd are obliged to pre&s;ent them&s;elves to their re&s;pective governors, as well to avoid the inconveniences of debts on their own account, as on that of their families, who might be &s;ubject to be mole&s;ted by credi|tors during their ab&s;ence. If a merchant has the lea&s;t connection with the court, it is expected that he will al&s;o pre&s;ent to the emperor, who, as he feels him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed, grants or refu&s;es him permi&s;&s;ion to enter upon the journey.

<P>As there are two modes of performing this pilgrimage, by &s;ea and by land, tho&s;e who prefer the former are &s;ubjected to an examination by the governor of the port whence they embark, to &s;ee that they pay the freight of the ve&s;&s;el, and to inform him&s;elf whether they have &s;ufficient means to go and return from this &s;acred object of Mahometan devotion, without being under the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing, or being &s;u&s;pected of u&s;ing any ba&s;e and di&s;honourable means of obtaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

<P>The place whence the caravan &s;ets out by land, is from Teza, a town in the province of Tedla, &s;ome di&s;tance to the La&s;t of the city of Fez, the

latter being the fir&s;t place of rendezvous.

<P>This grand caravan is always accompanied by many others, of which one goes to Algiers, another to Tunis, and a third to grand Cairo, &amp;c. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who go to Algiers and Tunis are not under the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king permi&s;&s;ion, as they are per&s;ons who are accu&s;tomed to carry on a trade with tho&s;e two places; whence they return with a quantity of their re&s;pective manufactures. The caps of Tunis are of great u&s;e in the empire of Morocco, and their &s;ilks al&s;o &s;ell at a very good price, though upon the whole tho&s;e of Al|giers are preferable for the girdles u&s;ed by the Moors, curtains, women's dre&s;s, and furniture for beds and rooms. The manufactures indeed of both Algiers and Tunis are brought to a greater perfec|tion than tho&s;e of Morocco. The merchants who go upon the&s;e expeditions carry with them ready money, Haicks and &s;lippers, which are the manu|factures of Morocco, and di&s;po&s;e of the two la&s;t articles to the Arabs and inhabitants of the towns in the neighbourhood of Algiers and Tunis, who, though they do not wear the Haick as a part of their dre&s;s, yet make u&s;e of them for a variety of other purpo&s;es.</P>

from Teza in the following order:&mdash;After having invoked the true and &s;ole God and his prophet Mahomet, to give every benediction to this &s;acred journey, they al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> meet near the tent of the chief conductor, who is named in Arabic Scheck Re|beck, and commence their devotions to the &s;ound of clarinets, tabors, &amp;c.

Next to this party follow tho&s;e who travel on foot, either from devo|tion or nece&s;&s;ity; to the&s;e is entru&s;ted the care of the loaded mules and camels. And the rear is brought up by tho&s;e who are mounted either on hor&s;es or mules. The caravan is put in motion at &s;un-ri&s;e, &s;tops at twelve o'clock at noon to dine, and about four in the afternoon the people encamp in the &s;ame manner as they did at Teza.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e which they take is through the in|terior parts of the country, leaving Tremecen, Algiers, and Tunis to their left. Some of them, indeed, make excu&s;ions to the two latter places, and afterwards join the caravan. By the&s;e means they are enabled both to obtain a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions for them&s;elves and bea&s;ts, and to &s;ell to the Arabs Haicks, &s;lippers, and old caps, for which they u&s;ually receive a very good price: and the profits enable them frequently to make advan|tageous purcha&s;es at Mecca, Alexandria, and Cairo.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival, after a journey of two months and a half, at that part of the &s;ea-coa&s;t where the tower of Salines is &s;ituated, and which is about half a days ride from the city of Tripoli, they re&s;t them&s;elves ten days. At this place all

the pilgrims &s;upply them&s;elves with forty or fifty days provi&s;ions, which is generally &s;ufficient to &s;upport them to Alexandria or Grand Cairo; and on their return they purcha&s;e in the neighbour|hood of Tunis and Tripoli a large &s;upply of mules, frequently giving only twenty-five hard dollars for what they afterwards &s;ell in Morocco for eighty or an hundred.</P>
<P>From the tower of Salines they continue their route as far as Alexandria and Grand Cairo, where they furni&s;h them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner as at Tripoli, with &s;ufficient provi&s;ions for the remainder of the journey, which requires al|together near &s;even months to accompli&s;h. To tho&s;e who undertake this journey for the purpo&s;e of trade, it generally an&s;wers extremely well.

<P>The Arabs from Fez as far as Alexandria and Grand Cairo, though a rude cla&s;s of people, are very warmly attached to their religion, and on that account give the pilgrims a friendly reception, furni&s;hing them with barley, butter, eggs, mutton, beef, &amp;c. From that place, however, to Mecca the route is not &s;o ea&s;y, as the Arabs, in&s;tead of the benefactors, frequently become the plunderers of the&s;e holy travellers. On the&s;e occa&s;ions they &s;pare nothing, and leave them not &s;o much as the nece&s;&s;aries of life; particularly if they refu&s;e the contributions which they u&s;ually demand for per|mitting the caravan to pa&s;s peaceably through the country.

banditti now a&s;&s;emble in very con&s;iderable bodies in the&s;e de&s;erts, and at certain pa&s;&s;es the travel|lers may be a&s;&s;ailed with great advantage. In pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;thmus of Suez, for in&s;tance, above Alexandia, the caravan may be defeated by an hundred men. The&s;e robbers, therefore, generally endeavour to po&s;t them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to attack it in this place.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e people who carry on a petty trade en|deavour to convert their little &s;tock into ready money upon their arrival at Mecca; where, with the remainder of the caravan, and other Maho|metan pilgrims, they commemorate by a fea&s;t the nativity of the great prophet Mahomet, when every per&s;on is obliged to &s;acrifice at lea&s;t one &s;heep. It is computed that on this day, which is the tenth of the moon Dalaja, above two millions of &s;heep are &s;laughtered at Mecca.</P>
<P>After the performance of this &s;olemn rite the majority of the travellers employ them&s;elves in laying out their money to the be&s;t advantage. Some purcha&s;e mu&s;lins Levant &s;ilks, &amp;c.; others e&s;&s;ence of ro&s;es, amber, mu&s;k, Per&s;ian &s;ilks, &amp;c. while another part of them &s;ave their money to lay it out at Grand Cairo, where they purcha&s;e a good &s;tock of raw &s;ilk, cottons, and manufactured &s;ilks of different kinds. In this city, indeed, every article may be had at nearly the &s;ame price as at, Mt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> whole, we may a&s;&s;ert, at a mo|derate computation, that the value of the articles contained in one of the&s;e caravans, joined with the ready money, amounts to two millions of hard dollars.</P>

<P>It would be no very difficult matter for a Chri&s;tian to join one of the&s;e caravans, provided he obtained the recommendation and expre&s;s per|mi&s;&s;ion of his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty, or the Shaik of the caravan, who would take him under his pro|tection. This ob&s;tacle would be &s;till further re|moved, if the Chri&s;tian would con&s;ent to wear the Turki&s;h habit or dre&s;s him&s;elf in the manner they are obliged to adopt at Grand Cairo. By the&s;e means he would obviate every inconvenience to which the European dre&s;s &s;ubjects a traveller, both with re&s;pect to the wild Arabs, and to the weak and illiberal people of the caravan. As the caravan, however, does not go far into the inte|rior parts of the country, the object of di&s;covery would hardly be &s;ufficient to counterbalance the fatigues and dangers of the expedition.</P>
<P>There are no caravans which go directly into the interior parts of the country. It would, in fact, be as dangerous for a Mahometan as for a Chri&s;tian to penetrate an hundred leagues beyond
<PB N="244" REF="027216_0252_0FD3E1906B7E6A28">
the inhabitants of the&s;e parts are &s;avage, avaricious, and capable of committing any crime for a very trifling emolument. A fatal proof the cruelty of the&s;e Arabs occurred in 1786, when forty pil|grims on their return from Mecca, were ma&s;&s;acred. The&s;e people demanded ho&s;pitality from the moun|taineers of Zamor near Mequinez, for only one night; but as they brought &s;ome valuable goods with them, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that it was owing to that circum&s;tance, that they were all put to death.</P>
<P>The country beyond the mountains of Atlas, about &s;ix days journey to the Ea&s;t of Morocco, is not even known though it is probable it might be penetrated with &s;afety, provided the &s;ame means were u&s;ed as are employed by the caravans which go to the South; that is, a &s;mall proportion of force, and a &s;mall proportion of genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>There is no particular caravan &s;o con&s;iderable for the South as that which goes to Mecca. As the&s;e indeed are intended merely for the purpo&s;es of commerce, they &s;eldom con&s;i&s;t of more than one hundred and fifty, or perhaps two, or at mo&s;t three hundred per&s;ons, including the mule|teers, camel-drivers, and other &s;ervants. Some of the&s;e caravans &s;et out from Morocco, while others go from Tarudant, Fez, and Tetuan. The fir&s;t pa&s;s by way of Domnet, while the others meet at Tafilet, and thence pur&s;ue their journey towards the de&s;ert. The&s;e caravans go no further than Tombut, where there are &s;ome merchants of Morocco, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the purpo&s;e of carrying on a trade with the inland parts of Guinea, where they traffick for &s;laves, ivory, gold du&s;t, &amp;c. The merchandizes which the caravans carry from
<PB N="245" REF="027216_0253_0FD3E19468C418A0">
Morocco, Tarudant, &amp;c. con&s;i&s;t of Haicks and blue cloths for which they find a good &s;ale throughout the country of the Mohafres and at Thouat.</P>
<P>The city of Thouat is in the interior parts of the country, about thirty days journey from Ta|filet. From Thouat the caravans proceed directly to Tombut. There is much greater danger in pa&s;&s;ing the two de&s;erts between Tafilet and Thouat, than between the latter place and Tombut. As the Arabs of the de&s;erts are much addicted to rapine, the caravans are obliged to make them trifling pre&s;ents, to enable them to travel without being mole&s;ted. The other Arabs, who purcha&s;e merchandize, &s;uch as blue cloths, &s;mall daggers, looking-gla&s;&s;es, &amp;c. pay generally in return o&s;trich-feathers; and this traffick is attended with very tolerable profits.</P>
<P>The articles which the caravans carry immedi|ately to Tombut are tobacco and &s;alt. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pay attention to what camels may be wanted for the purpo&s;es of carrying water through the de&s;erts, as in &s;ome parts they travel four, and in others nine days, without meeting with a drop of water. It is in a great mea&s;ure on this account that the camel becomes &s;o u&s;eful an animal in hot climates. Their &s;tomachs, it is well known, are &s;o con&s;tructed as to allow them to pa&s;s many days without food or drink. In the inner coats of their &s;tomachs there are a number of little cells, in which they retain a large proportion of water for a length of time, nature having provided the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with a method of regurgitating it when thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> From the &s;ize of the &s;tomach it al&s;o admits of a
<PB N="246" REF="027216_0254_0FD3E1946C6A4CE0">
large portion of food to be taken in at a time, to which they have recour&s;e by rumination when their appetite calls for a &s;upply of nouri&s;hment. Their owners, therefore, have only to give them plenty of barley and water at the entrance of the de&s;erts, and that proves &s;ufficient to la&s;t them till a fre&s;h &s;upply can be conveniently procured.</P>
<P>The&s;e extraordinary animals are able to carry a very great weight in proportion to their &s;ize, and to perform very long journeys without much ap|parent fatigue. They are u&s;ed both for the pur|po&s;es of riding and carrying burdens. Their &s;teps are very long and &s;low, and they are tract|able and ea&s;ily managed. They are taught to kneel down when they are loaded; and when u&s;ed for the &s;addle are entirely managed by a &s;hort and thick &s;tick, which both &s;erves the purpo&s;es of bridle and whip. It is not uncommon in Barbary to &s;ee three per&s;ons, with furniture in proportion, mounted upon one camel.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the caravans at Tombut, they exchange their tobacco and &s;alt for &s;laves, gold du&s;t, and ivory, which are brought thither from Guinea. Four thou&s;and &s;laves are &s;uppo&s;ed to be annually carried from Tombut, great part of whom are &s;ent to Ma&s;car, Algiers, and Tunis.&mdash;It but &s;eldom happens that any eunuchs are brought away, unle&s;s by a particular commi&s;&s;ion from the emperor or &s;ome of the princes, no other per&s;on in the country being permitted to keep them. It is indeed extremely difficult to procure them at all. The place whence they are u&s;ually brought is the kingdom of Bambara. In Muley I&s;hmael's reign the number of eunuch's in the em|pire

of Morocco was &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to &s;even hundred; but they are now &s;o reduced, that one hundred is the utmo&s;t that could be mu&s;tered in the whole empire.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been concerned in the trade to Tombut for the la&s;t twenty years, com|pute the value of the merchandizes tran&s;ported annually thither from the empire of Morocco to amount to at lea&s;t a million of hard dollars; and the commodities received in return, &s;uch as o&s;trich-feathers, ivory, gold du&s;t, amber, and Guinea &s;laves, to ten millions; two thirds of which are carried to Algiers, Tunis, &amp;c. The &s;laves are purcha&s;ed near Tombut, at a very cheap rate, there having been in&s;tances of a fine Negro boy being bought for &s;ix pounds of &s;alt.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM the un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts which I had made for the purpo&s;e of procuring my di&s;|patches, I had begun to reconcile my&s;elf to the idea of remaining a pri&s;oner at Morocco, when, to my great &s;urprize, at the expiration of a month from the time of the prince's departure, his Moori&s;h maje&s;ty &s;ent to me in particular ha&s;te to repair to the palace.</P>
<P>Upon receiving this me&s;&s;age my be&s;t hopes were excited. I naturally expected an immediate eman|cipation, as it is nece&s;&s;ary that every &s;tranger &s;hould &s;ee the emperor previous to his departure; and I flew to the palace with all the alacrity which &s;uch an expectation was certain to in&s;pire. What then was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when, upon my arrival at the palace, a me&s;&s;enger brought orders from the emperor, the purport of which was, that I &s;hould immediately examine one of his &s;ultanas who was indi&s;po&s;ed, and in the afternnoon return
<PB N="249" REF="027216_0257_0FD3E1990487DDC8">
with proper medicines, and at the &s;ame time report my opinion of her ca&s;e to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay whether di&s;appointment or &s;urprize were the predominant emotion in my mind on receiving this order. After the prejudices which from his di&s;like to the Engli&s;h, and his ignorance of the effects of internal medicines, the emperor was known to have entertained again&s;t me, and after having detained me at Morocco for &s;uch a length of time, with no apparent view but that of manife&s;ting his contempt of me as an En|gli&s;hman, it appeared unaccountable that he &s;hould give orders for my admi&s;&s;ion into the Harem, where in addition to the former objections, there were al&s;o &s;ome &s;till &s;tronger in the eyes of the Moors; as the admi&s;&s;ion of one of our &s;ex into that &s;acred depo&s;itory of female charms, was almo&s;t unprecedented, and I believe totally &s;o with re&s;pect to the Harem of the emperor.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the motives with his impe|rial maje&s;ty for the violation of Moori&s;h decorum in this in&s;tance, I did not conceive I had much rea&s;on to rejoice at the event. I had already expe|rienced too much ingratitude from the prince, as well as too much ungenerous treatment from the emperor, to encourage me to undertake any future engagement of the kind in this country; and the difficulties and prejudices which from experience I knew I had to encounter, when employed in my profe&s;&s;ional line by the Moors, united to the uncer|tainty of removing the lady's complaint, rendered it altogether not very &s;afe to admini&s;ter my advice under &s;uch di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances; and even that curio&s;ity which would naturally be ex|cited
<PB N="250" REF="027216_0258_0FD3E19B2A93BC08">
in mo&s;t per&s;ons on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, was not &s;ufficient to reconcile me to this new employment.</P>
<P>Unfortunately in this dilemma I had very little time allowed me to determine, &s;ince the me&s;&s;enger was waiting to conduct me to the gate of the Harem. My embarra&s;&s;ment, however, continued only for a &s;hort period; for I &s;oon recollected that it was in vain to oppo&s;e the emperor's order. I therefore deferred giving a deci&s;ive an&s;wer till I had &s;een my patient, and made my&s;elf fully ac|quainted with the nature of her complaint.</P>
<P>The public and u&s;ual entrance to the Harem is through a very large arched door-way, guarded on the out&s;ide by ten body guards, which leads to a lofty hall, where the captain or Alcaide, with a guard of &s;eventeen eunuchs, are po&s;ted. No per&s;on is admitted into this hall, but tho&s;e who are known to have bu&s;ine&s;s in the Harem.</P>
<P>The emperor's order being delivered on the out&s;ide of the door to the Alcaide, I was imme|diately, with my interpreter, conducted into the Harem by one of the Negro eunuchs. Upon en|tering the court into which the women's apart|ments open, I di&s;covered a motley group of con|cubines, dome&s;tics, and negro &s;laves, who were variou&s;ly employed. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t de&s;cription had formed them&s;elves into circles, &s;eated on the ground in the open court, and were apparently engaged in conve&s;ation.&mdash;The dome&s;tics and &s;laves were partly employed in needle-work, and partly in preparing their cu&s;co&s;oo. My appearance in the court, however, &s;oon attracted their attention, and a con&s;iderable number of them upon ob&s;erving me, unacquainted with the means by which I had
<PB N="251" REF="027216_0259_0FD3E19B2EFBA620">
been admitted into the Harem, retreated with the utmo&s;t precipitancy into their apartments; while others more courageous approached, and enquired of my black attendant who I was, and by who&s;e orders he had brought me thither.</P>
<P>The moment it was known that I was of the medical profe&s;&s;ion, parties of them were detached to inform tho&s;e who had fled, that I was &s;ent in by order of the emperor to attend Lalla Zara, my intended patient's name, and reque&s;ting of them to come back and look at the Chri&s;tian. Seranio Tibib! Chri&s;tian Doctor! re&s;ounded from one end of the Harem to the other; and in the cour&s;e of a few minutes I was &s;o completely &s;urrounded by women and children, that I was unable to move a &s;ingle &s;tep.</P>
<P>Every one of them appeared &s;olicitous to find out &s;ome complaint on which &s;he might con&s;ult me, and tho&s;e who had not ingenuity enough to invent one, obliged me to feel their pul&s;e; and were highly di&s;plea&s;ed if I did not evince my ex|cellence in my profe&s;&s;ion by the di&s;covery of &s;ome ailment or other. All of them &s;eemed &s;o urgent to be attended to at the &s;ame time, that while I was feeling the pul&s;e of one, others were behind, pulling my coat and entreating me to examine their complaints, while a third party were upbraid|ing me for not paying them the &s;ame attention. Their ideas of delicacy did not at all corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of our European ladies, for they exhi|bited the beauties of their limbs and form with a degree of freedom that in any other country would have been thought indecent; and their conver&s;ation was equally unre&s;trained.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="027216_0260_0FD3E19E96FD0280">This apparent laxity of conduct in the Moori&s;h ladies does not proceed from a depravity in prin|ciple. As the female &s;ex in this country are not entru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of their own honour, there is no virtue in re&s;erve. A depraved education even &s;erves to corrupt in&s;tead of to re&s;train them. They are not regarded as rational or moral agents; they are only con&s;idered as be|ings created entirely to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the plea&s;ure of man. To excite the pa&s;&s;ions, and to do and &s;ay every thing which may inflame a licentious ima|gination, become therefore nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;h|ments in the female &s;ex, and their manners and conduct naturally a&s;&s;ume a ca&s;t totally different from tho&s;e women in a more refined and more liberal &s;tate of &s;ociety. In tho&s;e in&s;tances to which I refer, they were not con&s;cious of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the limits of decency; and in others they manife&s;ted a &s;ingular attention to what they conceived to be decorum. When I reque&s;ted to &s;ee the tongues of &s;ome patients who complained of feveri&s;h &s;ymp|toms, they refu&s;ed to comply, con&s;idering it as incon&s;i&s;tent with their mode&s;ty and virtue; &s;ome of them indeed laughed at the &s;ingularity of the reque&s;t, and attributed it either to an impertinent curio&s;ity, or an inclination to impo&s;e on their un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P>As the number of my patients continued to in|crea&s;e rather than to dimini&s;h, there appeared but little pro&s;pect of an introduction to the &s;ultana Lalla Zara, whom I was fir&s;t directed to attend, in any rea&s;onable time. The eunuch, however, wearied out with waiting, exerted all the vigour of authority which his natural effeminacy would
<PB N="253" REF="027216_0261_0FD3E1A0774C6710">
admit of in obliging them to di&s;per&s;e, and which was &s;o far effectual at lea&s;t as to allow me room to pa&s;s, though this female croud &s;till followed me till I had nearly reached the lady's apart|ment.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t court into which I had been in|troduced, I pa&s;&s;ed through two or three &s;imilar, till I at length arrived at the chamber of my intended patient. I was here detained a little time in the court, till my patient and her apartment were ready to receive me.&mdash;Upon my entrance I found the lady &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a mattre&s;s placed upon the floor, and covered with fine linen, with twelve white and negro attendants, &s;eated on the floor al&s;o, in different parts of the chamber. A round cu&s;hion was placed for me next to the lady, on which I was de&s;ired to be &s;eated. I &s;hould have remarked, that, contrary to my expectations, I found that none of the emperor's women di&s;|gui&s;ed their faces in the manner which I had ex|perienced in the prince's Harem, but I &s;aw them all with the &s;ame familiarity as if I had been intro|duced into the hou&s;e of an European.</P>
<P>Lalla Zara*, who was of Moori&s;h parents, was about eight years ago remarkable for her beauty and accompli&s;hments; on which account &s;he was then in every re&s;pect the favourite wife of the emperor. So dangerous a pre-eminence could not be enjoyed, without exciting the jealou&s;y of tho&s;e females who&s;e charms were le&s;s con&s;picuous; and who, be&s;ides the mortification of having a le&s;s<NOTE PLACE="foot">Lalla, &s;ignifies lady or mi&s;tre&s;s, but is only applied in this country to the &s;ultanas.</NOTE>

<P>Determined to effect her ruin, they contrived to mix &s;ome poi&s;on (mo&s;t probably ar&s;enic) in her food, and conducted the dete&s;table plot with &s;uch art and addre&s;s, that it was not perceived until the deleterious drug had began its baneful operations. She was &s;eized with mo&s;t violent &s;pa&s;ms, and a continual vomiting; and had &s;he not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncommonly &s;trong con&s;titution, &s;he mu&s;t immediately have fallen a victim to the machina|tions of her rivals. After a &s;evere &s;truggle, how|ever, between life and death, the effects of the poi&s;on in &s;ome degree abated; but it left the un|happy lady in a &s;tate of dreadful debility and ir|ritation, and particularly in the &s;tomach, from which it was not perhaps in the power of medi|cine to extricate her. Her beauty too, the fatal cau&s;e of her misfortune, was completely de&s;troyed, and her enemies, though di&s;appointed in their aim of de&s;troying her life, yet enjoyed the malignant triumph of &s;eeing tho&s;e charms which had excited their unea&s;ine&s;s, reduced below the &s;tandard of ordinary women.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw her, &s;he had &s;uch a weakne&s;s of dige&s;tion, that every &s;pecies of food which &s;he took, after remaining a few hours on her &s;tomach, was returned perfectly crude and undige&s;ted. As &s;he did not receive proper nouri&s;hment, her body had wa&s;ted away to a &s;hadow, and her frame was in &s;o a weak a &s;tate, as not to allow her to walk without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Her complexion was entirely altered. Her &s;kin, from being naturally clear and fair, as I was informed, was changed to a
<PB N="255" REF="027216_0263_0FD3E1A1D0B97A98">
&s;ickly brown, which, joined to a ruined &s;et of teeth, and a gha&s;tly countenance, had effaced every trace of that beauty, which &s;he before might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Upon my fir&s;t enter|ing her apartment, though from my profe&s;&s;ion accu&s;tomed to behold objects of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery yet I was &s;o forcibly &s;truck with her unhappy &s;itu|ation and wretched appearance, that I was obliged to exert all the fortitude of which I was ma&s;ter, to avoid the di&s;covery of my feelings.</P>
<P>Lalla Zara was at this time about &s;ix-and-thirty years of age, and though in &s;o weak a &s;tate, had two beautiful young children; the fir&s;t was in its &s;ixth year, and the younge&s;t, which was then under the care of a wet-nur&s;e, was very little more than a twelve-month old. I was quite a&s;to|ni&s;hed to ob&s;erve &s;uch &s;trong and apparently heal|thy children, the offspring of a mother who&s;e con|&s;titution was &s;o dreadfully impaired. It was cer|tainly, however, a very fortunate circum&s;tance for Lalla Zara that &s;he had the&s;e children; &s;ince by the Mahometan law a man cannot divorce his wife provided &s;he bear him children; &s;o that though the emperor took very little notice of this poor lady, yet he was, for the above rea&s;on, obliged to maintain both her&s;elf and her offspring.</P>
<P>From the wretched &s;ituation in which I have de&s;cribed this unfortunate female, it is ea&s;y to con|ceive that her &s;pirits mu&s;t revive at the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of procuring relief in her di&s;agreeable complaint. Such, indeed was the the ca&s;e. She received me with all that &s;atisfaction which hope, united with &s;ome degree of confidence, mo&s;t natu|rally in&s;pires.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="027216_0264_0FD3E1A34B1C19D8">Under the&s;e circum&s;tances the predicament in which I felt my&s;elf was, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, mo&s;t truly embarra&s;&s;ing.

Both the&s;e &s;entiments for &s;ome time pre&s;&s;ed equally on my mind, and left m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at a lo&s;s how to determine. I at length, however, fixed on a middle plan of conduct, which appeared likely to affect the &s;afety of the lady, without endangering my own. This was, to give a proper cour&s;e of medicines a fair trial for a fortnight; and then, if the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of amendment &s;hould appear in con&s;equence of them, I could leave her more, with &s;uch directions as might enable her to u&s;e them without medical attendance.</P>
<P>This plan I conceived it mo&s;t prudent not to communicate immediately to my patient: I there|fore, without affording her any v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y flattering hopes of a cure, a&s;&s;ured her, that I would u&s;e every means with which I was acquainted for the re&s;to|ration of her con&s;titution. Contrary to mo&s;t other Moori&s;h females, I found Lalla Zara in every re&s;pect affable and polite; though deprived of her health, &s;he retained her natural vivacity, and with the ravages of her inveterate malady, &s;he &s;till re|mained a plea&s;ing and an intere&s;ting character.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="027216_0265_0FD3E1AA6C6CE4F0">I was upon the point of taking my leave of Lalla Zara, when a female me&s;&s;enger appeared to re|que&s;t my attendance upon Lalla Batoom, who, from the priority of her marriage, is called the fir&s;t wife of the emperor, and is more properly en|titled to the denomination of &s;ultana than any of the others.</P>
<P>As the emperor had given directions for my ad|mi&s;&s;ion to Lalla Zara only, and as I &s;oon perceived that the eunuch regarded me with the mo&s;t jealous eye, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that, however my curio&s;ity might be excited, yet when &s;olicited to vi&s;it the other ladies, I could not help feeling &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ions of the danger which I incurred by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the emperor's order. On the other hand, I reflected, that both the eunuch and the women would be equally involved in the con&s;e|quences of a di&s;covery; the fir&s;t for conducting me, and the others for admitting me into their apartments; and therefore that it was as much their intere&s;t as mine to be cautious, as well in pre|venting the circum&s;tance from reaching the empe|ror's ears, as in not receiving me in their apart|ments at a time when he was likely to enter the Harem. All the&s;e arguments, united to the de&s;ire which I felt to avail my&s;elf of &s;o favourable an opportunity of &s;eeing a place where no European had ever before been admitted, had &s;o much weight, that my objections were &s;peedily removed.</P>
<P>I found Lalla Batoom to be a perfect Moori&s;h beauty; &s;he was mo&s;t immoderately fat, about forty years of age, with round and prominent cheeks, which were painted a deep red, &s;mall black eyes, and a vi&s;age completely guiltle&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion.

She was &s;itting upon a mattra&s;s on the floor, which, as u&s;ual, was covered with fine white linen, and &s;he was &s;urrounded with a large party of concubines, whom I was informed &s;he had in|vited to be her vi&s;itors on the occa&s;ion. Her room bore a much greater appearance of grandeur than that of Lalla Zara, and &s;he was indulged with a whole &s;quare to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I entered her apartment, Lalla Batoom reque&s;ted of me to be &s;eated clo&s;e by her &s;ide, and to feel her pul&s;e. Her complaint was a &s;light cold, of which an unconquerable de&s;ire of &s;eeing me had mo&s;t probably been the occa&s;ion. As &s;oon as I had felt her pul&s;e, and pronounced my opinion, I was employed in going through the &s;ame ceremony with all the other ladies in the room, who de&s;ired I would acquaint them with all their complaints without any farther enquiries. From the great experience which I had acquired in this kind of practice while at Tarudant, and from the knowledge which I had attained of their complaints, which in general proceeded from too violent an attack upon the cu&s;co&s;oo, I was enabled to make no de&s;picable figure in this my&s;terious art, and was very &s;ucce&s;sful in my opinions.</P>
<P>From the &s;ubject of their own health, the con|ver&s;ation pre&s;ently changed to critici&s;ms upon my dre&s;s. There was not a &s;ingle part of it which was not examined, and commented on with their u&s;ual loquacity. My interpreter was then a&s;ked if I was a married man, and if &s;o, whether I had brought my wife with me, with a variety of equally important que&s;tions. In the mid&s;t of this conver&s;ation, tea was introduced, though at eleven
<PB N="259" REF="027216_0267_0FD3E1E62738BDB0">
o'clock in the morning. A &s;mall tea-board with four very &s;hort feet, &s;upplied the place of a table, and held the tea equipage. The cups were about the &s;ize of large walnut-&s;hells, of the very be&s;t Indian china, and of which a very con&s;iderable number was drank.</P>
<P>After I had concluded my vi&s;it to the queen of the Harem, I was next conducted to Lalla Douyaw, the favourite wife of the emperor, whom I found to be what would be termed in Europe a very fine and beautiful woman. She is a native of Genoa, and was, with her mother &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t of Barbary, whence they became the em|peror's captives. At that period, though but eight years of age, her per&s;onal charms were &s;o very promi&s;ing and attractive, that they induced the emperor to order her to be taken forcibly from her mother, and placed in his Harem, where, though at &s;o early a period of life every means were in vain employed to entice her to change her religion, till at length the emperor threatened to pull up every hair of her head by the roots, if &s;he de&s;i&s;ted any longer; and &s;he then found her&s;elf obliged to &s;ubmit to his inclinations.</P>
<P>After remaining &s;ome time in the character of a concubine, the emperor married her; and from her great great beauty, addre&s;s, and &s;uperior men|tal accompli&s;hments, &s;he &s;oon gained his be&s;t affec|tions, which &s;he ever after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. She had, indeed, &s;o much influence over him, that though he was naturally of a very &s;tubborn di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he was never known to fail in any favour &s;he &s;olicited, provided &s;he per&s;evered in her reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="027216_0268_0FD3E1AC51C1D660">When I &s;aw her &s;he was about thirty years of age; in her per&s;on rather corpulent, and her face was di&s;tingui&s;hed by that expre&s;&s;ive beauty which is almo&s;t peculiar to the Italian women. Her ad|dre&s;s was plea&s;ing, and her behaviour polite and attentive. In the Harem, from her accompli&s;h|ments in reading and writing well the Arabic lan|guage, &s;he was con&s;idered by the other females as a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tance of being taken &s;o young into the Harem, &s;he had nearly forgotten her na|tive language, and could only conver&s;e fluently in Arabic, having but a di&s;tant recollection of the events which fir&s;t brought her into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. She, however, informed me that we were brother and &s;i&s;ter (a common phra&s;e u&s;ed by the Moors to expre&s;s the affinity which Chri&s;tians bear to each other in a religious &s;en&s;e) and had di&s;|cernment enough to ob&s;erve that &s;he was among a very uncouth and ignorant people. She added, that her mother, whom I had afterwards an op|portunity of &s;eeing at a Venetian merchant's hou&s;e at Mamora, was &s;till a Chri&s;tian, though &s;he her|&s;elf was no longer &s;uch, and that &s;he hoped I would vi&s;it her every time I came to the Harem.</P>
<P>Her complaint was a &s;corbutic affection of the gums, which threatened the lo&s;s of &s;ome of her front teeth. This circum&s;tance gave her the great|e&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, as &s;he was fearful it might disfigure her other features, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that means cau&s;e an abatement in the affection of the emperor. On this account &s;he was extremely anxious to have my advice, though when I was in her apartment &s;he always experienced the &s;tronge&s;t apprehen&s;ions

le&s;t my attendance on her &s;hould come to the em|peror's knowledge, which might be attended with the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences to us both.</P>
<P>Lalla Zara, owing to her bad &s;tate of health, and the con&s;equent ruin of her per&s;onal charms, had long been neglected by the emperor, who, mo&s;t probably, admitted of my attendance on her more for the &s;ake of exonerating him&s;elf from her con&s;tant importunities to &s;ee me (for it was a con|&s;iderable time before &s;he could gain his con&s;ent) than from any great anxiety on his part for her recovery. With re&s;pect to a per&s;on of &s;uch a de&s;cription, it was perhaps a matter of indifference to the emperor by whom &s;he was &s;een or known, and therefore there was no ground for that jea|lou&s;y to which the Moors in general are &s;o noto|riou&s;ly addicted.</P>
<P>Lalla Douyaw was very differently &s;ituated. She was in the bloom of health and beauty, with all tho&s;e exterior accompli&s;hments which were likely to excite the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion; and indeed the emperor's attachment to her was unexampled.&mdash;Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, when we con&s;ider with what caution the Moors in general endeavour to prevent any foreign intercour&s;e with their wo|men, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the emperor would reli&s;h the idea of an European in particular admitted frequently, and almo&s;t alone, to this fir&s;t object of his deare&s;t affections.</P>
<P>Lalla Douyaw, however, to prevent the po&s;&s;i|bility of detection, enjoined her female &s;laves to be particularly a&s;&s;iduous to inform her when there was the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on for an alarm; while, on the other hand &s;he was continually making pre|&s;ents

to the eunuch who attended me, cautioning him at the &s;ame time not to intimate to any per&s;on out of the Harem that I had been admitted into her apartment. She &s;o far gained an a&s;cendancy over him, that I frequently remained with her for an hour at a time, conver&s;ing upon European cu&s;toms; and though &s;he knew but little of them, yet the &s;ubject always &s;eemed to afford her the highe&s;t plea&s;ure. As &s;oon as &s;he thought it would be imprudent for me to remain any longer, &s;he re|que&s;ted of me to go, but with a promi&s;e to call upon her the next time I vi&s;ited the Harem. Her apprehen&s;ion of a di&s;covery was not confined to the chance of an alarm from the emperor, or from the perfidy of the eunuch; it was likewi&s;e extend|ed to the jealou&s;y of the other women in the Ha|rem, who might probably rejoice in an opportu|nity of effecting her ruin. It was, however, per|haps a fortunate circum&s;tance for us both, that by mo&s;t of them admitting me into their apartments, it was equally their intere&s;t to be &s;ilent, &s;ince a di&s;covery of the one would inevitably lead to the detection of the others.</P>
<P>The fourth wife, who is daughter to an Engli&s;h renegado, and mother to the reigning emperor, being at Fez at the time when I vi&s;ited the Harem, I had not an opportunity of &s;eeing.</P>
<P>When I waited on the emperor in con&s;equence of my vi&s;it to the Harem, I was honoured with quite a private audience; for he received me in the court clo&s;e to his hou&s;e where no per&s;on is permitted to be pre&s;ent while the emperor is there, but a few pages, and the people who immediately belong to his carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="027216_0271_0FD3E1B35DDD8200">The &s;overeign was in an open four-wheeled carriage, hung very low, of a &s;ize ju&s;t large enough to admit one per&s;on, and drawn by the &s;ons of four Spani&s;h renegadoes. As &s;oon as I was ob|&s;erved by him, his maje&s;ty ordered me with my interpreter to approach, and carry him the medi|cines, de&s;iring me to ta&s;te them before him, to convince him, I imagine, that there was nothing in them that was improper. He then examined them with great attention, and ordered me to explain to him what they were, and in what man|ner they were expected to act. When required to give my opinion concerning the ca&s;e of my patient, I informed his maje&s;ty, that the &s;ultana's complaint was of &s;uch a nature as to require a very long cour&s;e of medicines, but which I appre|hended it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to change; that therefore I propo&s;ed to attend her for a fortnight, and then leave her a proper &s;upply, with &s;uch directions as might enable her to take them almo&s;t with the &s;ame advantage as if I was pre&s;ent. I added, that I had received orders from the go|vernor of Gibraltar to return to the garri&s;on im|mediately, which if I di&s;obeyed I &s;hould certainly lo&s;e a very good employment; and that, as I was convinced of the emperor's kind intentions to|wards me, by the promi&s;es which he had made at my fir&s;t audience, I was per&s;uaded his maje&s;ty would not detain me a day longer than the period I mentioned. In reply, the emperor &s;aid, that he only wi&s;hed me to attend the &s;ultana for about ten days, at the expiration of which, if the me|dicines proved likely to be u&s;eful, I &s;hould then leave her a proper &s;upply, and he would &s;end me

home (to u&s;e his expre&s;&s;ion) upon a fine hor&s;e. He then gave orders to his prime mini&s;ter to pay me ten hard dollars as a pre&s;ent; and commanded that free admittance &s;hould be granted me into the royal Harem, whenever I thought it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Harem, as I before ob&s;erved, forms a part of the palace or &s;eraglio, without any other imme|diate communication with it than a private door, u&s;ed only by the emperor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The apartments, which are all on the ground floor, are &s;quare, very lofty, and four of them enclo&s;e a &s;pacious &s;quare court into which they open by means of large folding-doors. The&s;e, as in other Moori&s;h hou&s;es, which in general have no windows, &s;erve the purpo&s;e of admitting light into the apartments. In the centre of the&s;e courts, which are floored with blue and white checquered tiling, is a fountain, &s;upplied by pipes from a large re&s;ervoir on the out&s;ide of the palace, which &s;erves for the frequent ablutions recommended by the Mahometan religion, as well as for other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The whole of the Harem con&s;i&s;ts of about twelve of the&s;e &s;quare courts communicating with each other by narrow pa&s;&s;ages, which afford a free acce&s;s from one part of it to another, and of which all the women are allowed to avail them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The apartments are ornamented externally with beautiful carved wood, much &s;uperior to any I have ever &s;een in Europe, as well for the difficulty of the workman&s;hip, as for the ta&s;te with which it is fini&s;hed. In the in&s;ide mo&s;t of the rooms are hung with rich dama&s;k of various colours; the floors are covered with beautiful carpets, and there
<PB N="265" REF="027216_0273_0FD3E1B859F09060">
are mattre&s;&s;es di&s;po&s;ed at different di&s;tances for the purpo&s;es of &s;itting and &s;leeping.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the apartments are furni&s;hed at each extremity with an elegant European mahogany bead&s;ted, hung with dama&s;k, having on it &s;everal mattre&s;&s;es placed one over the other, which are covered with various coloured &s;ilks; but the&s;e beds are merely placed there to ornament the room. In all the apartments without exception, the ceiling is wood, carved and painted. The principal or|naments in &s;ome, were large and valuable looking-gla&s;&s;es, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different &s;izes, in gla&s;s ca&s;es, were di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. In &s;ome of the apartments I ob&s;erved a projection from the wall, which reached about half way to the ceiling, on which were placed &s;everal mattre&s;&s;es over each other, and each covered with &s;ilks of different colours. Above and below this projection the wall was hung with pieces of &s;attin, velvet, and dama&s;k, of different colours, orna|mented on each edge with a broad &s;tripe of black velvet, which was embroidered in its centre with gold.</P>
<P>The whole Harem was under the management of the principal &s;ultana, Lalla Batoom: that is in general, &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of mi&s;tre&s;s of the Harem, without having any particular con|troul over the women. This lady and Lalla Douyaw, the favourite, were indulged with a whole &s;quare to them&s;elves; but Lalla Zara, and all the concubines, were only allowed each a &s;ingle room.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="027216_0274_0FD3E1B9C9925910">Each female had a &s;eparate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the e&s;timation in which they were held by him. Out of this they were expected to furni&s;h them&s;elves with every article of which they might be in want; the Harem is therefore to be con&s;idered as a place where &s;o many di&s;tinct lodgers have apartments without paying for them, and the principal &s;ultana is the mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole.</P>
<P>The daily allowance which each woman re|ceived from the emperor for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was very trifling indeed. Lalla Douyaw, the favourite &s;ultana, had very little more than half-a-crown Engli&s;h <HI>per diem,</HI> and the others le&s;s in proportion. It mu&s;t be allowed, that the emperor made them occa&s;ional pre&s;ents of money, dre&s;s, and trinkets; but this could never be &s;ufficient to &s;upport the number of dome&s;tics and other expences they mu&s;t incur. Their greate&s;t dependence, therefore, was on the pre&s;ents they received from tho&s;e Europeans and Moors who vi&s;ited the court, and who em|ployed their influence in obtaining &s;ome particular favour from the emperor. Nor had the monarch &s;ufficient delicacy to di&s;courage this mode of nego|ciation. He well knew that if his women had not obtained &s;upplies by other means, they mu&s;t have had recour&s;e to his pur&s;e; and as he had taken too good precautions to allow any mi&s;chief to ari&s;e from this cu&s;tom, he was always well plea&s;ed to have bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted through that channel. Amba&s;&s;adors, con&s;uls, and merchants indeed, who were acquainted with the nature of the court, per|fectly knew that this was always the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful mode that could be adopted. As an illu&s;tration

of this a&s;&s;ertion, when I was at Morocco, a Jew, de&s;irous of obtaining a very advantageous favour from the emperor, for which he had been a long time un&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;oliciting, &s;ent to all the prin|cipal ladies of the Harem pre&s;ents of pearls to a very con&s;iderable amount; the con&s;equence was, that they all went in a body to the emperor, and immediately obtained the wi&s;hed-for conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ladies &s;eparately furni&s;h their own rooms, hire their own dome&s;tics, and, in fact, do what they plea&s;e in the Harem, but are not permitted to go out without an expre&s;s order from the em|peror, who very &s;eldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one palace to another. In that ca&s;e a party of &s;oldiers is di&s;patched a little di&s;tance before them, to di&s;|per&s;e the male pa&s;&s;engers in particular, and to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of their being &s;een. This previous &s;tep being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and after|wards the&s;e mi&s;erable females cover them&s;elves entirely with their Haicks, and either mount mules which they ride like men, or, what is more u&s;ual, are put into a &s;quare carriage or litter, con&s;tructed for this purpo&s;e, which by its lattice-work allows them to &s;ee without being &s;een. In this manner they &s;et off under the charge of a guard of black eunuchs. This journey, and &s;ometimes a walk within the bounds of the palace, with which they are, however, &s;eldom indulged, is the only ex|erci&s;e they are permitted to take.</P>
<P>The emperor's Harem con&s;i&s;ted of between &s;ixty and a hundred females, be&s;ides their dome&s;tics and &s;laves, which were very numerous. The four

<P>Many of the concubines were Moori&s;h women, who had been pre&s;ented to the emperor, as the Moors con&s;ider it an honour to have their daughters in the Harem; &s;everal were European &s;laves, who had been either made captives or purcha&s;ed by the emperor, and &s;ome were Negroes.</P>
<P>In this groupe the Europeans, or their de|&s;cendants, had by far the greate&s;t claim to the character of hand&s;ome. There was one in par|ticular, who was a native of Spain, and taken into the Harem at about the &s;ame age as Lalla Douyaw, who was indeed a perfect beauty. Nor was this lady quite &s;ingular in that re&s;pect, for many others were almo&s;t equally hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Moori&s;h women have in general an inex|pre&s;&s;ive countenance, and a ru&s;tic &s;implicity of manners. Their per&s;ons are below the middle &s;tature, of a remarkably fat and &s;quare make, with very large hands and feet. Their com|plexions are either a clear brown, or, what is more u&s;ual, of a &s;allow ca&s;t. Their faces are round, and their eyes in general black; the no&s;e and mouth very &s;mall, and the latter is u&s;ually ac|companied with a good &s;et of teeth.</P>

I was de&s;ired to admini&s;ter to her a remedy for a &s;light complaint of the &s;tomach, with which &s;he had been affected for a few days.

As it was im|po&s;&s;ible that I could be plea&s;ed with the&s;e igno|rant and unmerited reproaches, and as I was well aware that &s;ince I had no directions to attend any per&s;on but Lalla Zara, it was entirely a matter of favour in me to comply at all with their reque&s;t, I embraced the opportunity of at once &s;ilencing her ill-timed loquacity, and effectually putting a &s;top to &s;imilar impertinence from any other quarter. I explained to her, in the fir&s;t place, that &s;o far from the medicines having the tendency of which &s;he accu&s;ed them, that they in reality were of much too mild a nature for a per&s;on of her con|&s;titution. I added, that &s;ince &s;he entertained &s;uch &s;u&s;picions of them from the fir&s;t, how could &s;he be &s;o de&s;titute of affection and feeling as to compel her &s;i&s;ter to take what &s;he would not venture upon her&s;elf, without regard to the difference of her age, or to the &s;tate of the health? That her un|grateful behaviour would operate as a di&s;courage|ment to me, and would perhaps prevent my af|fording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to many of the other ladies, who&s;e complaints might require much more at|tention than hers did; and that in future &s;he could not expect to receive from me, if it &s;hould even be nece&s;&s;ary, the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She now began to relent, and acknowledged that &s;he had been rather too warm, adding many apologies, and concluded with wi&s;hing me a happy return to my country and friends.</P>
<P>I could adduce many other anecdotes to illu&s;|trate the ignorance and pride of the&s;e unfortunate women; but this I think will be &s;ufficiently con|vincing to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. It may not be im|proper
<PB N="271" REF="027216_0279_0FD3E1C3B12D7658">
to add, that this little altercation proved afterwards of great &s;ervice to me in the Harem, by convincing the ignorant part of it that I paid very little attention to their caprice.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that the eunuchs kept a very clo&s;e and watchful eye over me when I vi&s;ited the Harem, I always took care that my deportment in their pre&s;ence &s;hould be &s;uch as to give them no rea&s;on for any complaint again&s;t me. When in the apartments of my patients I &s;ometimes &s;o far for|got my&s;elf, as to enter into a pretty long conver|&s;ation; but I found that the eunuch was always di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt our entertainment, by hint|ing that I had already &s;taid too long, and mu&s;t therefore depart. With Lalla Douyaw, however, they &s;eemed to have le&s;s influence; and though &s;he thought it prudent to make them occa&s;ional pre|&s;ents, yet &s;he never would &s;uffer me to leave the room till by her own reque&s;t.</P>
<P>In one of my vi&s;its I ob&s;erved a proce&s;&s;ion, which upon inquiry I found was intended as an invocation to God and Mahomet for rain, of which there had been a &s;carcity for &s;everal pre|ceeding months. The proce&s;&s;ion was commenced by the younge&s;t children in the Harem, who were barely able to walk, two a-brea&s;t, and the&s;e were followed by the next in age, till at length a great part of the women fell into the groupe, making altogether upwards of a hundred per&s;ons. They carried on their heads their prayers written on paper, pa&s;ted on a &s;quare board, and proceeded through all the courts &s;inging hymns, the purport of which was adapted to the &s;olemn occa&s;ion. I was informed that they had continued this cere|money
<PB N="272" REF="027216_0280_0FD3E1C51E16D1E0">
every day during the whole of the dry weather, and were to repeat it till their prayers were attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the emperor occa&s;ionally came into the Harem, yet it was more u&s;ual for him to give notice to tho&s;e ladies who&s;e company he wi&s;hed, to attend in his apartment; when they made a point of &s;etting off their charms to the be&s;t advantage. When in his pre&s;ence they paid him every atten|tion which a common &s;lave would &s;hew to his ma&s;ter, and never ventured to offer their opinion, except by his approbation.&mdash;But to return to the Moori&s;h ladies.</P>
<P>From the idea which is &s;o prevalent with this people, that corpulency is the mo&s;t infallible mark of beauty, the women u&s;e a grain which they name Ellhouba, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring that degree of per&s;onal excellence at which they a&s;pire: this they powder and eat with their Cu&s;co&s;oo. They likewi&s;e take, with the &s;ame intention, large quantities of pa&s;te, heated by the &s;team of boiling water, which they &s;wallow in the form of bo|lu&s;es. It is certainly true, that the number of corpulent women in this country is very con&s;ider|able, but it is probable that this circum&s;tance ari&s;es as much from their very confined and inac|tive mode of life, as from any of the particular means which they employ to produce that effect.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the ladies con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hirt, with remarkably full and loo&s;e &s;leeves, hanging almo&s;t to the ground, the neck and brea&s;t of which are left open, and their edges are neatly embroidered with gold. They wear linen drawers, and over the &s;hirt a Caftan, which is a dre&s;s &s;omething
<PB N="273" REF="027216_0281_0FD3E1C6E1A480C8">
&s;imilar in form to a loo&s;e great coat without &s;leeves, hanging nearly to the feet, and is made either of &s;ilk and cotton or gold ti&s;&s;ue. A &s;a&s;h of fine linen or cotton folded is tied gracefully round the wai&s;t and its extremities fall below the knees. To this &s;a&s;h two broad &s;traps are annexed, and pa&s;&s;ing over each arm over the &s;houlders form a cro&s;s on the brea&s;t, and to that part of it which pa&s;&s;es between the brea&s;t and &s;houlder of each arm is fixed a gold tortoi&s;e, carele&s;sly &s;u&s;pending in front a gold chain. Over the whole dre&s;s is extended a broad &s;ilk band of the Fez manufacture, which &s;urrounds the wai&s;t, and completes the dre&s;s, ex|cept when they go abroad, and then they inve&s;t them&s;elves in a carele&s;s manner with the Haick.</P>
<P>The hair is plaited from the front of the head backwards in different folds, which hang loo&s;e behind, and at the bottom are all fixed together with twi&s;ted &s;ilk. Over the heads they wear a long piece of &s;ilk about half a yard wide, which they tie clo&s;e to their head, and &s;uffer the long ends, which are edged with twi&s;ted &s;ilk, to hang behind in an ea&s;y manner nearly to the ground. The remainder of the head-dre&s;s is completed by a common &s;ilk handkerchief which &s;urrounds the head like a woman's clo&s;e cap, differing from it only by being fixed in a full bow behind in&s;tead of in front. At the upper part of each ear hangs a &s;mall gold ring half open, which has at one end a clu&s;ter of precious &s;tones, &s;ufficient nearly to fill up the vacancy occa&s;ioned by the opening of the ring. At the tip, or lower part of the ear, is likewi&s;e &s;u&s;pended a broad and &s;olid gold ring, which is &s;o large that it reaches as low as the
<PB N="274" REF="027216_0282_0FD3E1C810E3D270">
neck, and which, as well as the other, has a clu&s;|ter of precious &s;tones, in proportion to the &s;ize of the ring. The ladies wear on their fingers &s;everal &s;mall gold rings, &s;et with diamonds or other pre|cious &s;tones, and on the wri&s;ts broad and &s;olid gold bracelets, &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;et with precious &s;tones. Their necks are ornamented with a great variety of bead and pearl necklaces. Below the&s;e a gold chain &s;urrounds the neck, and &s;u&s;pends in front a gold ornament.</P>
<P>Like the men, the Moori&s;h women wear no &s;tockings, but u&s;e red &s;lippers, curiou&s;ly embroi|dered with gold which they take off when they enter their rooms. Immediately above the ankle, each leg is &s;urrounded with a large &s;olid gold ring, which is narrow in front, but very broad behind.</P>
<P>The ladies paint their cheeks of a deep red, and &s;tain their eye-lids and eye-brows with a black powder which I apprehend to be antimony. It is a branch of artificial beauty in this country, to produce a long black mark on the forehead, another on the tip of the no&s;e, and &s;everal others on each cheek. The chin is &s;tained of a deep red, and thence down to the throat runs a long black &s;tripe. The in&s;ide of the hands, and the nails, are &s;tained of a deep red, &s;o deep indeed, that in mo&s;t lights it borders on black; and the back of the hands have &s;everal fancy marks of the &s;ame colour. The feet are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainted in a &s;imilar manner with the hands.</P>
<P>I &s;eldom ob&s;erved in the Harem the women at any employment but that of forming them&s;elves into different circles for the purpo&s;e of conver&s;a|tion,
<PB N="275" REF="027216_0283_0FD3E1C9A114EEE0">
&s;ometimes in the open courts, at others in the different apartments. As they are not permit|ted to enter the mo&s;ques, they pray at the ap|pointed times in their own chambers. The Moors, indeed, entertain the prejudice which is commonly attributed to the Mu&s;&s;ulmen in general, that the female &s;ex are altogether an inferior &s;pecies of ani|mals, merely formed to be &s;laves to the plea&s;ures of men, who&s;e &s;alvation is con&s;equently not of &s;o much importance; and with this &s;entiment the conduct of the men towards them in every in&s;tance corre&s;ponds. The Moors likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ign other rea&s;ons for not permitting their females to enter their places of wor&s;hip: they a&s;&s;ert that it would be not only contrary to the cu&s;tom which prevails in the country, of not allowing the &s;exes to meet together in any particular &s;pot, but it might al&s;o, by creating loo&s;e and improper ideas, draw off the attention from their devotion.</P>
<P>The women have their Talbas as well as the men their Talbs. The&s;e per&s;ons who are either wives or concubines, ju&s;t as it happens, and who&s;e principal qualifications appear to be reading or writing, teach the younger part of the Harem to repeat their prayers, and the older females they in&s;truct in the laws and principles of their religion.</P>
<P>All the emperor's daughters, and the children of his concubines, as &s;oon as they were of a pro|per age, were &s;ent to Tafilet, where they fini&s;hed their education, and by intermarrying with the de&s;cendants of his ance&s;tors they &s;erved to people that extraordinary city&mdash;extraordinary on this ac|count, that the inhabitants of it are all Sharifs, or the &s;uppo&s;ed lineal de&s;cendants of Mahomet, and
<PB N="276" REF="027216_0284_0FD3E1CD54094D90">
are mo&s;t of them collaterally or otherwi&s;e related to the pre&s;ent royal family of Morocco. Muley I&s;hmael, who, as I before ob&s;erved, was grand|father to the late emperor, had three hundred chil|dren at Tafilet, and their de&s;cendants are now &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to nine thou&s;and who all live in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of the emperor's wive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are con&s;idered as princes, who have each an equal claim to the empire, and as &s;uch are always re&s;pected. If they have not di&s;obliged their father, they are generally appointed to the government of &s;ome of the pro|vinces, where, in the capacity of Ba&s;haws, their principal object is the accumulation of riches.</P>
<P>The reader will have ob&s;erved, that I re&s;erved my ob&s;ervations on the female part of &s;ociety in this country, till I had given &s;uch a general ac|count of the Harem as might &s;erve for a proper introduction to that part of my &s;ubject. By this arrangement I have relieved my&s;elf from the tedi|ou&s;ne&s;s of repetition, and my readers from that ob&s;curity which naturally en&s;ues when information is imparted in a disjointed &s;tate. A few ob&s;erva|tions will &s;erve to complete the de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Moori&s;h women may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es; the black or negro women, and the white.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t are either &s;laves or have been &s;o for|merly; and from their &s;ervices, or through the favour of their proprietors have obtained their freedom. The&s;e women have all the characters, both with re&s;pect to di&s;po&s;ition, features, and complexion, peculiar to the country from which they are brought. Many of them are in the &s;itu|ation of concubines, and others in that of dome&s;|tics. Their male children are all brought up to
<PB N="277" REF="027216_0285_0FD3E1CD58621890">
&s;erve in the army of the emperor.&mdash;To this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;s may be added the mulattoes, both male and fe|male, who are the production of a Moor and a Negro woman, and are con&s;equently very nume|rous in this empire; but as they differ but little in character from the Negroes, and are only di&s;|tingui&s;hed from them being indulged with their freedom, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over without any fur|ther ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the female &s;ex who may be properly con&s;idered as natives of the country, are of a white, or rather a &s;allow complexion. From the very limited &s;phere in which they are allowed to act, and the contempt in which they are held as members of &s;ociety, their characters admit of very little of that variety which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Eu|ropean women. Happy, perhaps, it is for them, that the &s;un of knowledge has never beamed upon their gloomy pri&s;ons, &s;ince it could only &s;erve to enlighten them to a &s;en&s;e of their own mi&s;ery, di&s;grace, and &s;ervitude! Happy is that accommo|dating power, which providence has vouch&s;afed to human-kind, which adapts them to their &s;everal &s;ituations! and happy it is that the information of mankind is generally &s;uch as &s;uits the &s;phere in which they are de&s;tined to act!</P>
<P>Educated with no other view than for the &s;en|&s;ual purpo&s;es of their ma&s;ter, or hu&s;band, the chief object of the female &s;ex of this country is to ad|mini&s;ter to his plea&s;ure, and by the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to alleviate the rigours of that &s;ervitude to which they are doomed. When in the pre&s;ence of their de&s;pot, both wives and concubines are obliged to manife&s;t the &s;ame re&s;pect as his com|mon
<PB N="278" REF="027216_0286_0FD3E1CF8C541CD8">
&s;laves; and though all are not confined clo&s;ely to their hou&s;es as is cu&s;tomary in the emperor's Harem, yet when they do go out they are obliged to be extremely circum&s;pect in concealing their faces, and cautious in every part of their de|meanour. Women of di&s;tinction, however, are very &s;eldom allowed to go abroad; it is only tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s which are u&s;ually &s;een in the &s;treets, and even the&s;e are &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed and wrap|ped up in their Haicks, that they appear more like a bale of cloth put in motion, than a human form.</P>
<P>If they happen to meet an European in the country, at a time when no Moor is in &s;ight, they &s;eldom mi&s;s the opportunity of di&s;playing their features, by throwing the Haick on one &s;ide, and even to laugh and conver&s;e with him, though al|ways with the utmo&s;t ri&s;k, as the eye of jealou&s;y, it is well known, never &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>If an European or a Jew &s;hould be caught in a clande&s;tine connection with a Moori&s;h woman, he is obliged to become a convert to the Mahometan faith, or his life would be forfeit; and the wo|man, I was informed, is puni&s;hed either by burn|ing or drowning, though I cannot &s;ay I ever knew an in&s;tance of that dreadful &s;entence being put in execution. A man indeed mu&s;t have uncommon addre&s;s, and no &s;mall &s;hare of caution, to carry on an intrigue of that kind, though on the part of the women of this country he will &s;eldom want for encouragement.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that the means which the Moors employ for the prevention of intrigues, very often tend to the encouragement of
<PB N="279" REF="027216_0287_0FD3E1D125018E78">
them. By dre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in the female habit, men may very ea&s;ily pa&s;s the &s;treets unob&s;erved, as they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured they will not be addre&s;&s;ed or even looked at by the Moors; and if they con|trive to call at the hou&s;e when the ma&s;ter is from home, they need be under no apprehen&s;ions of being detected when he returns. If he &s;ees a &s;trange woman's &s;lippers at the doors of his Ha|rem, he concludes it is a female neighbour, and never approaches the room till the &s;lippers are removed.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the opulent females among the Moors, is &s;imilar to that of the emperor's ladies, differing only in the value of the materials. Tho&s;e of the inferior cla&s;s wear linen drawers, and over them a coar&s;e woollen frock, tied round the wai&s;t with a band. They plait the hair in two folds, from the upper part of the head all the way down behind, wearing over it a common handkerchief tied clo&s;e to the head, and when they go out they wear the Haick.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>TEN days having elap&s;ed &s;ince my fir&s;t attend|ance on Lalla Zara, the emperor de&s;ired my patient to acquaint him what effect the medicines had produced; and being informed that &s;he was apparently in a &s;tate of recovery, he &s;ent into the Harem a doubloon piece, wrapped up in one cor|ner of a &s;ilk handkerchief, and ordered the lady to pre&s;ent me with it as a compliment for the &s;er|vice I had already rendered her, accompanied with &s;plendid promi&s;es, if I &s;ucceeded in re&s;toring her to perfect health.</P>
<P>Little reflection was nece&s;&s;ary to convince me, that the&s;e manoeuvres had an aim and tendency very different from that of fulfilling the emperor's engagements relative to my return. It required, therefore, &s;ome con&s;ideration to determine, whe|ther it would be mo&s;t prudent to continue my at|tendance, or exert my&s;elf immediately with re|doubled vigour to accompli&s;h my emancipation.
<PB N="281" REF="027216_0289_0FD3E1D486EF8B10">
The latter mode of conduct I re&s;olved upon, for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I had been ab&s;ent from the garri&s;on much longer than was originally intended by government; it was, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far the protraction of my re&s;idence in in Morocco might interfere with the arrangements of my &s;uperiors, or affect the &s;ervice. Secondly, every European with whom I conver&s;ed, or cor|re&s;ponded, advi&s;ed me by all means to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of returning; &s;ince, though my patient was for the pre&s;ent in a recovering &s;tate, yet, from the caprice and ignorance of the Moors, there was &s;ome rea&s;on to apprehend that &s;he might tire of her medicines; and con&s;idering the matter in the mo&s;t favourable point of view, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he could be relieved entirely from her complaint, it was not improbable that the women, who had been the original occa&s;ion of her illne&s;s, upon ob&s;erving her recovery, might with the &s;ame diabolical malignity which induced them to ad|mini&s;ter the fir&s;t do&s;e of poi&s;on, be inclined to avail them&s;elves of my attendance, and injure her con&s;titution a &s;econd time; while all the ill con&s;e|quences would infallibly be attributed to my treat|ment. The age and infirmities of the emperor al&s;o rendering my &s;ituation very precarious, deter|mined me to employ the earlie&s;t opportunity in effecting my e&s;cape; and the following was the plan which appeared to promi&s;e the mo&s;t probable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I told my patient that I had brought with me very little more medicine than was &s;ufficient for the cure of Muley Ab&s;ulem; and that tho&s;e which
<PB N="282" REF="027216_0290_0FD3CBC4C7FFC290">
I had admini&s;tered to her were the few which had not been u&s;ed; that as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;oon be exhau&s;ted, and as my attendance on her with|out medicines could an&s;wer no purpo&s;e whatever, I would recommend her for her own &s;ake, to ad|vi&s;e the emperor to &s;end me to Gibraltar for a fre&s;h &s;upply. "Ah!" exclaimed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lady, <Q>there is no occa&s;ion for your going, the emperor can write to the con&s;ul for them.</Q> For a reply of this kind I was not wholly unprepared; and as I had found it nece&s;&s;ary to act a part on this occa&s;ion, I determined to go through with it, and reluctantly to play the empiric, by informing my patient that the compo&s;ition of the&s;e medicines was known to no per&s;on but my&s;elf; and therefore to write for them would be totally u&s;ele&s;s. This &s;tatement ap|peared unan&s;werable, and my plan was &s;o far crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. An application, on my account, was immediately made to the emperor by all the principal women, whom Lalla Zara had engaged in her &s;ervice for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The emperor, however, who&s;e di&s;cernment had been excellent in his youth, and who&s;e intellect was at intervals as vigorous as ever, was not to be impo&s;ed on. He promi&s;ed the women more than he ever intended to perform, and ten days more elap&s;ed, when I found my&s;elf as near return|ing as on my fir&s;t arrival at Morocco.</P>
<P>Thus baffled in my attempt, though my inde|fatigable female agents repeated their application not &s;eldomer than twice every day, I applied to a German renegado, who &s;poke the Engli&s;h lan|guage, and who, from his &s;ituation at court, had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing the emperor pri|vately,
<PB N="283" REF="027216_0291_0FD3E1DA115A1F98">
and intreated of him to procure me a licence to depart. But all that he was able to ob|tain in my favour, was a renewal of the &s;ame fair promi&s;es which had been &s;o frequently made, and made with the &s;ame &s;incerity. I mu&s;t not omit, however, to relate, that in a few days after this application, I received from the emperor a pre&s;ent of two hor&s;es, accompanied with a po&s;itive a&s;|&s;urance of being di&s;patched immediately home.</P>
<P>One of the hor&s;es was young, but was in &s;o wretched and emaciated a &s;tate, that he appeared better calculated to afford food for the canine race, than to prove of any utility to a traveller. The other, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was not in &s;o &s;tarved and mi&s;erable a condition, but then he was completely &s;uperannuated, and con&s;equently quite as u&s;ele&s;s as his companion. He had been pre&s;ented to the emperor in the morning by a poor man, who, for &s;ome trifling di&s;grace which he had in|curred, had brought this hor&s;e as an atonement; the man, however, was committed to pri&s;on, and and in the afternoon the hor&s;e was pre&s;ented to me.</P>
<P>Before I could get the&s;e unparalleled cour&s;ers out of the walls of the palace, I was &s;topped by the porters of four gates, who each demanded a hard dollar as a perqui&s;ite annexed to their places. On my arrival at home, two deputy ma&s;ters of hor&s;e al&s;o came to my apartment for a pre&s;ent for them&s;elves, and for their chief; &s;o that the reader may ea&s;ily judge how far I was a gainer by the emperor's munificence!</P>
<P>After this circum&s;tance, &s;everal days having elap&s;ed without any pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing

my wi&s;hes, I was advi&s;ed by an European, who had come from Mogodore to Morocco upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as the &s;ure&s;t means of &s;ucceeding, to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity that offered of the emperor's appearing in public, which he &s;eldom did &s;o as to be &s;een by &s;trangers, and, tru&s;ting no longer to other agents, at once a&s;k his maje&s;ty for my di&s;|patches. Fortunately, as I thought, the emperor afforded me an opportunity of &s;eeing him the fol|lowing day; and, though the &s;oldiers would not allow me to approach him &s;o near as to enable me to &s;peak to him, yet I took care to place my&s;elf in a con&s;picuous &s;ituation; but after continuing about half an hour, he retired without taking the lea&s;t notice of me, or even appearing to ob&s;erve me.</P>
<P>The emperor, upon this occa&s;ion, was in one of his open courts on hor&s;eback, with a large umbrella &s;u&s;pended over his head by a &s;oldier of the negro infantry, who was &s;tanding in front of the hor&s;e; while two other attendants were on each &s;ide, and with pieces of &s;ilk fixed to a cane, were, by an ea&s;y but con&s;tant motion, guarding off the flies from the emperor's face. The mini&s;|ters of &s;tate were placed in front, and behind them were about a hundred foot &s;oldiers in dif|ferent divi&s;ions, forming altogether a kind of cre&s;cent. Some of the&s;e troops were armed with mu&s;quets, which they held in a &s;tiff manner clo&s;e to their bodies, with the muzzles pointed perpen|dicularly, while others had no weapon of defence but thick clubs.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign being at this moment in a good humour, was conver&s;ing with his mini&s;ters; and,
<PB N="285" REF="027216_0293_0FD3E1DDD89BBA78">
as my interpreter informed me, he was boa&s;ting to them of the mighty actions which the Moors had performed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians; remarking, that his predece&s;&s;ors had deprived them of nearly all the places they had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Bar|bary, and that he had the &s;atisfaction of having taken Mazagan from the Portugueze. The mini&s;|ters entered very little further into the conver&s;ation than to repeat at the conclu&s;ion of each &s;entence, Alla Cormus Sidi! in Engli&s;h, May God pre&s;erve the king! which was communicated to the neare&s;t party of &s;oldiers, and from tho&s;e to the next, till they made the palace echo with their voices.</P>
<P>My ill &s;ucce&s;s upon this occa&s;ion did not deter me from making an experiment upon another favourable opportunity which offered, after the lap&s;e of a few days. I then had influence enough with the &s;oldiers to allow me to approach &s;o very near the emperor's per&s;on, as rendered it utterly impo&s;&s;ible for him to avoid ob&s;erving me, though not &s;ufficiently clo&s;e to enable me to &s;peak to him. A me&s;&s;enger was con&s;equently di&s;patched by the &s;overeign to know (u&s;ing his own expre&s;&s;ion) what the the Chri&s;tian wanted. I returned for an&s;wer, that I came to thank his maje&s;ty for the honour he had conferred on me, by pre&s;enting me with the two hor&s;es, at the &s;ame time to re|mind him of his royal promi&s;e to &s;end me im|mediately home. In con&s;equence of his attention on fir&s;t &s;eeing me, I expected every moment to be ordered into his immediate pre&s;ence, but in that re&s;pect I was di&s;appointed; for, after con|ver&s;ing near half an hour with his mini&s;ters, he
<PB N="286" REF="027216_0294_0FD3E1DF4EC0A068">
retired, and left me in the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e which I had a few days before experienced. The emperor was on hor&s;eback, and was endeavouring to explain to his auditors the beauties of various parts of the Koran, and laid a particular &s;tre&s;s on tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which teach the followers of Ma|homet to dete&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Such repeated di&s;appointments, after having ex|erted my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in every mode I could devi&s;e, it mu&s;t be allowed were &s;ufficient to induce me to con&s;ider my &s;ituation as de&s;perate; and I felt my&s;elf totally at a lo&s;s what further &s;teps could be adopted in this very critical &s;ituation. The un|ea&s;ine&s;s I experienced at this moment was happily not of long continuance, for the day following the German renegado brought me the emperor's letter of di&s;patch, con&s;i&s;ting merely of a few lines addre&s;&s;ed to the governor of Tangier, ordering him to permit me to embark, with my two hor&s;es, for Gibraltar.</P>
<P>The reader will too ea&s;ily anticipate the extreme plea&s;ure I felt at the idea of &s;hortly leaving a country where I had experienced &s;uch a continued &s;eries of ingratitude, di&s;appointment, and unea&s;i|ne&s;s, to render it at all nece&s;&s;ary for me to enlarge upon that topic. It will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that I lo&s;t no time in making the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the journey, and in availing my&s;elf of the earlie&s;t opportunity to take my leave of the ladies in the Harem, mo&s;t carefully avoiding to com|municate to them the contents of the emperor's letter. Had they known, indeed, that I was not to return, it is probable they would have employed
<PB N="287" REF="027216_0295_0FD3E1E25BFC5E20">
the &s;ame influence for my detention, which they had before exerted before in favour of my libera|tion, and mo&s;t likely with greater &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is humiliating and unplea&s;ant in the highe&s;t degree to &s;toop to deception upon any occa&s;ion; to be obliged, therefore, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, and for my own per&s;onal &s;afety, to carry on a &s;y&s;te|matical plan of duplicity, was not the lea&s;t of the hard&s;hips to which I was compelled to &s;ubmit in this country. I could not, however, now retreat; and, as I knew that Gibraltar furni&s;hed many ar|ticles which were not to be procured in Barbary, I made an offer of my &s;ervices to the ladies; and received the follow commi&s;&s;ions, for the faithful execution of which, on my return from Gibraltar, I was obliged to pledge my&s;elf.</P>
<P>For Lalla Batoom, the queen of the Harem, a &s;et of elegant, but very &s;mall cups and &s;aucers.</P>
<P>For Lalla Douyaw, the emperor's favourite wife, a neat mahogany tea-board, with four &s;hort feet, to have two drawers, and to be elegantly ornamented with gla&s;&s;es; a &s;et of very &s;mall Indian cups and &s;aucers; a &s;et of different kinds of per|fumed waters.</P>
<P>For Lalla Zara, my patient, nine yards of yellow, the &s;ame of crim&s;on, and the &s;ame of cochi|neal coloured dama&s;k; the &s;ame quantities and colours in &s;atins; one dozen of Indian cups and &s;au|cers; one hundred large red beads<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one che&s;t of tea and &s;ugar; a large quantity of coffee and nut|megs.</P>
<P>For one of the concubines, a large portion of different coloured &s;attins and &s;ilks; a variety of hand&s;ome pearls; a &s;et of Indian cups and &s;aucers;
<PB N="288" REF="027216_0296_0FD3E2252C878940">
two &s;mall mahogany boxes for cloaths; two japanned tea-boards, the one to be white and the other yellow.</P>
<P>For another concubine, &s;ome perfumed waters; a mahogany bead&s;tead and po&s;ts; a green Dutch box.</P>
<P>For Lalla Talba, a prie&s;te&s;s, a hand&s;ome pre|&s;ent, which &s;he leaves to my ta&s;te and choice.</P>
<P>For the daughter of Muley Ha&s;em, a ma|hogany che&s;t with two drawers; a fla&s;k of laven|der water.</P>
<P>For Lalla Zara's nur&s;e, twelve large red beads.</P>
<P>For two of the eunuchs, each a &s;ilver watch.</P>
<P>The&s;e commi&s;&s;ions may perhaps appear too tri|fling to de&s;erve in&s;ertion; but I have brought them forward to the reader only becau&s;e the&s;e little circum&s;tances frequently di&s;play the peculiar ta&s;te, the manners, the genius of a country, much bet|ter than tho&s;e weighty and important tran&s;actions in which the pa&s;&s;ions common to human nature mu&s;t be intere&s;ted, and in which, of con&s;equence, all people in &s;imilar circum&s;tances mu&s;t act and feel alike.</P>
<P>It would have required no trifling &s;um of money to purcha&s;e all the&s;e articles; and even when that ob&s;tacle was removed, there would ari&s;e one &s;till greater from the difficulty of tran&s;portation in this country. As Morocco is an inland city, I was entirely precluded from the &s;afe&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t of carriages; and by land, many of the articles were &s;o cumber&s;ome and weighty, that in the bad roads it would have been impracticable to employ mules. I &s;hould therefore have been reduced to the nece&s;|&s;ity of hiring camels, the expence of which,
<PB N="289" REF="027216_0297_0FD3CBD74FBEE240">
joined to that of the commi&s;&s;ions, would con|&s;equently have been enormous.</P>
<P>Having &s;upplied Lalla Zara with the few me|dicines which remained, and taken my final leave of the Harem, my next object was to find out a new interpreter, &s;ince the per&s;on whom I had procured at Mogodore, had it not in his power to accompany me to to Tangier. In his place I fixed upon a mulatto, who was born a Chri&s;tian in one of the Engli&s;h We&s;t India I&s;lands, and up|on coming to Mogodore as a &s;eaman in an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, was immediately on account of his com|plexion, claimed by the Moors as a countryman. They committed him immediately to pri&s;on, and, by the influence of hard u&s;age, at length compelled him to become a convert to their religion. This man, who is between &s;ixty and &s;eventy years of age, has been in the country about &s;even years, and was occa&s;ionally employed in the public works by the late emperor. He can &s;peak the Engli&s;h, French, Spani&s;h, Italian, and Arabic languages, but the Engli&s;h is mo&s;t familiar to him.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e pre&s;ented to me by Muley Ab&s;ulem I mounted my&s;elf, and made my interpreter ride tho&s;e of the emperor alternately, that I might give them every po&s;&s;ible chance of reaching Tangier alive, in ca&s;e I could not di&s;po&s;e of them on the road. The&s;e, with three hor&s;e &s;oldiers allowed by the emperor, two mules for my baggage, and a muleteer to take charge of them, formed the whole of my &s;uite on the journey.</P>
<P>We departed from Morocco on the 12th of February 1790, and in three days arrived at the ca&s;tle of Bul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, which is a journey of about
<PB N="290" REF="027216_0298_0FD3CBD95121B248">
eighty miles, con&s;i&s;ting of an uninterrupted &s;eries of wild uncultivated heath. This ca&s;tle was the fir&s;t piece of architecture which offered it&s;elf to our view &s;ince we left Morocco; the country be|ing very thinly inhabited by only a few Arabs, who live in tents. In the&s;e Douhars or encamp|ments, I endeavoured, on the &s;core of &s;afety, nightly to pitch my tent.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle is &s;ituated on the &s;ummit of a very high and rugged hill, forming on its Northern &s;ide a &s;teep precipice, at the bottom of which runs a deep and rapid river, named the Morbeya, which I had previou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed at its termination in the ocean at Azamore. As a piece of architecture, this ca&s;tle has no recommendation but the &s;trength of its walls: it is inhabited by &s;ome Negroes who were bani&s;hed to this place, at the time when Sidi Mahomet thought proper to di&s;band a con&s;ider|able portion of his black troops; intending, by that means, to prevent their rai&s;ing a mutiny or rebellion in the country, to which, as I have inti|mated, they are always inclined. To di&s;po&s;e of them in this manner, therefore, was &s;ound policy, as, though they were out of the way of mi&s;chief for the pre&s;ent, they might ea&s;ily be embodied upon any pre&s;&s;ing emergency.</P>
<P>The eminent &s;ituation of this fortre&s;s, the &s;teep and rugged precipice, the depth and rapidity of the river below, with the wildne&s;s of the neigh|bouring country, fill the mind with a mixture of admiration and &s;ublime horror. But what attrac|ted my attention more than any other circum|&s;tance, was the mode in which they pa&s;s this dan|gerous river. At Azamere, Sallee, Mamora,
<PB N="291" REF="027216_0299_0FD3CBE3EFF98E20">
Larache, &amp;c. where the rivers are too deep to be forded, the traveller is ferried over; and yet at this part, though at no very great di&s;tance from any of the above places, the people are totally ignorant what kind of a machine a boat is. What is &s;till more remarkable, the fir&s;t people of the country who are obliged to pa&s;s this river in their way from Morocco to all the Northern provinces, and who are as well acquainted with the u&s;e of boats as the Europeans, are content to &s;ubmit to the crazy &s;ub&s;titute which they find here, rather than impart to the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle this ea&s;y piece of information.</P>
<P>The mode in which the&s;e people cro&s;s the river, &s;erved to remind me of a puerile amu&s;ement, in which mo&s;t boys at one period or other have taken delight. A raft is formed of eight &s;heep-&s;kins, filled with air, and tied together with &s;mall cords; a few &s;lender poles are laid over them, to which they are fa&s;tened, and this is the only means u&s;ed at Buluane to conduct travellers with their baggage over the river.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the raft is loaded, in other words, as &s;oon as it is charged with as much weight as it will bear without &s;inking, a man &s;trips, jumps in|to the water, and &s;wims with one hand, while he pulls the raft after him with the other; and in the mean time, a &s;econd places him&s;elf behind, pu&s;hing and &s;wimming in a &s;imilar manner. The current at fir&s;t carries the apparatus a con&s;iderable way down the river, but by the activity of the &s;wimmers it is &s;peedily extricated, and its contents as quickly landed. The hor&s;es, mules, &amp;c. having every article removed from their backs, are driven
<PB N="292" REF="027216_0300_0FD3CBE597FDB558">
in a body to the water &s;ide, where the Moors im|mediately get behind them, and by the violence of their &s;houts &s;o completely terrify the animals, that one or two of them &s;peedily take to flight, and &s;et the example, by &s;wimming, to the re&s;t, when they immediately follow.</P>
<P>Four days after leaving this river, we arrived at Sallee, which is about a hundred and ten miles from Buluane, and one hundred and ninety from Morocco, without the occurrence of a circum&s;tance worth relating; the country proving a continuance of the &s;ame uncultivated heath as far as Men&s;ooria, which has been de&s;cribed in a former part of this Tour.</P>
<P>Sallee being the fir&s;t town I had &s;een &s;ince my departure from Morocco, which was &s;even days, I was happy to avail my&s;elf of my former intro|duction to the French con&s;ul, and remain with him a couple of nights. After this agreeable re|laxation, I departed for Tangier, where I arrived on the 26th of February.</P>
<P>As it was evident that the hor&s;es which had been pre&s;ented to me by the emperor, were not worth the expence of exportation, and indeed &s;eemed &s;carcely able to encounter the journey, I took every oportunity that offered on the road to di&s;po&s;e of them, but my efforts were not attended with &s;ucce&s;s; and by the time I arrived at M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">a, they were &s;o completely tired, that they would certain|ly have died had I u&s;ed them another day. I there|fore found it nece&s;&s;ary to leave them in the care of a Venetian gentleman who re&s;ided at Mamora, with a reque&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of them in the be&s;t man|ner he could; and, as I did not like to lo&s;e the
<PB N="293" REF="027216_0301_0FD3CBE6F37FF1D8">
advantage of the order for embarkation, which is always to be con&s;idered as very valuable, &s;ince no hor&s;es are exported but by an expre&s;s order of the emperor, under his &s;ign manual, I reque&s;ted this gentleman to purcha&s;e for me two of the be&s;t that were to be procured in the province, and to &s;end them after me to Tangier; but they unfortu|nately did not arrive in time.</P>
<P>In about a fortnight after my arrival at Tangier, an order came down from the emperor, de&s;iring the governor to purcha&s;e at the expence of his royal trea&s;ury, two oxen, ten &s;heep, ten milch goats with their kids, a hundred fowls, and a large proportion of fruit and vegetables of every de&s;crip|tion. The&s;e articles were to be pre&s;ented to me as from the emperor, in return for my attendance on Lalla Zara; and I was to be allowed per|mi&s;&s;ion to embark them free of all duty, for Gibraltar. The &s;ame order brought likewi&s;e a reque&s;t from the emperor, that I would en|gage to &s;end my patient a fre&s;h &s;upply of me|dicines.</P>
<P>On the 27th of March I arrived at Gibraltar. It would be trifling with the reader to de&s;cribe my feelings on the fir&s;t view of a &s;pot, protected by Engli&s;h laws, and decorated by Engli&s;h manners. My &s;en&s;ations, indeed, may be more ea&s;ily con|ceived than they can be expre&s;&s;ed. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that no wretch, e&s;caped from the gloomy horrors of a dungeon, could experience more lively plea&s;ure on fir&s;t contemplating the light of day, than I felt on the fir&s;t view of an Engli&s;h garri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="027216_0302_0FD3CBE8EE1CA830">As the communication between the garri&s;on and Barbary was not open at the time of my arrival, the pre&s;ent of the emperor proved more valuable than I at fir&s;t conceived it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SOON after my arrival at Gibraltar, I was pre|vailed upon to dige&s;t and arrange the notes and ob&s;ervations which I had made during my re&s;idence in Barbary, and to publi&s;h propo&s;als for a nar|rative of my Tour. In the&s;e propo&s;als, having engaged to relate the particulars of the emperor's death, and of his &s;ons &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and being de&s;irous of procuring every information that could &s;erve to complete my account of the empire of Morocco, I obtained leave of ab&s;ence for a &s;hort time from the garri&s;on for the purpo&s;e, and was induced from that motive to pay a &s;econd vi&s;it to Tangier. It would be u&s;ele&s;s to detain the reader with any further de&s;cription of that place, I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that after diligently collecting all the information political or otherwi&s;e, that I could
<PB N="296" REF="027216_0304_0FD3E1E7F76BF148">
procure, I availed my&s;elf of the opportunity of vi&s;iting Tetuan, which the new emperor had once more opened to the re&s;ort of Chri&s;tians; and which I had long, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, de&s;ired to &s;ee.</P>
<P>The city of Tetuan is very plea&s;antly &s;ituated at the opening of the Straits into the Mediter|ranean; it is built on a ri&s;ing ground between two ranges of high mountains, one of them forming a part of the le&s;&s;er Atlas. It lies about ten leagues to the Ea&s;t of Tangier, and commands a very beautiful pro&s;pect of the Mediterranean, from which it is di&s;tant about five miles; and the valley near which it is &s;ituated is variegated with gardens, plantations of olives, and vineyards, and is orna|mented with a river, which takes its cour&s;e di|rectly through its centre.</P>
<P>The barren and gloomy appearance of the lofty mountains, which &s;eem almo&s;t to project over each &s;ide of the town, contra&s;ted with the beautiful verdure with which it is immediately &s;urrounded, the di&s;tant view of the &s;ea, and the &s;erpentine direction of the river, which is navigable for &s;mall craft as far as Marteen, afford altogether a &s;cene in the highe&s;t degree picture&s;que and romantic.</P>
<P>The town it&s;elf is of very con&s;iderable extent, and its walls are flanked in different parts with &s;quare forts, on which a few &s;mall pieces of ordnance are mounted. This fortification, how|ever, is merely calculated to defend the place again&s;t an attack from the Arabs, who, when di&s;contented, are ready to plunder every thing which is expo&s;ed to their depredations; but it
<PB N="297" REF="027216_0305_0FD3E1EA8BCCF730">
could by no means re&s;i&s;t the exertions of a regular army. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;mall forts, there is a &s;quare ca&s;tle on the &s;ummit of the hill, on which twenty-four pieces of cannon are mounted; though this is al&s;o but a weak and ill-con&s;tructed piece of for|tification, yet from its elevated &s;ituation it com|mands the town in every direction.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Tetuan are very narrow, filthy, and many of them are nearly arched over by the hou&s;es. Of the intention of the&s;e projections I could form no conception, unle&s;s they are meant, by keeping off the rays of the &s;un, to render the &s;treets cooler in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. If &s;o, it mu&s;t on the other hand be allowed, that they al&s;o prevent a free circulation of air, which, in a hot climate, and in &s;treets &s;o narrow and filthy, mu&s;t be greatly injurious to the health of the in|habitants.</P>
<P>Though the hou&s;es have a very mean appearance from the &s;treets, yet their apartments in general are roomy, tolerably convenient, and well fur|ni&s;hed; and, contrary to tho&s;e of Tangier, are built two &s;tories high. The Elcai&s;&s;eria, or fair for the di&s;po&s;al of goods, is filled with &s;hops, con|taining a great variety of very valuable articles, both of European and their own manufacture. From Fez they procure the articles of that place, as well as tho&s;e of Tunis, Algiers, Alexandria, and Guinea. From Spain and Gibraltar they im|port tho&s;e of Europe, for which they give in re|turn provi&s;ions and fruit of every de&s;cription; of all the towns in the empire, therefore, Tetuan may now be con&s;idered as next to Fez in commer|cial importance.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="027216_0306_0FD3E1EC098495A0">As the Moori&s;h inhabitants are principally mer|chants on a large &s;cale, they are opulent, much more poli&s;hed and acce&s;&s;ible to &s;trangers than tho&s;e of mo&s;t of the other towns in this empire. Their complexions are generally fair, and they are alto|gether a well-looking people. On our fir&s;t arrival, from the novelty of &s;eeing Chri&s;tians in the town after an exclu&s;ion of nearly twenty years, when we walked the &s;treets the people univer&s;ally ran out of their hou&s;es to look at us; and a very con|&s;iderable body of them for &s;ome time followed us wherever we went. They, however, by no means offered us any kind of in&s;ult; on the contrary, in|deed, being informed that we were Engli&s;h, they expre&s;&s;ed every mark of &s;atisfaction, and many of them invited us to their gardens. The Moors were always partial to the Engli&s;h in preference to every other European nation; they even pro|fe&s;&s;ed their attachment at the very time when Sidi Mahomet was upon &s;uch ill terms with our court; and &s;ince Muley Yazid's acce&s;&s;ion, they have given the mo&s;t unlimited &s;cope to the expre&s;&s;ion of their partiality.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;ques of Tetuan are very large, nume|rous, and appear to have by far a greater claim to magnificence, than tho&s;e in the other towns of the empire.</P>
<P>The Jews in this place, previous to the late plunder by order of the new emperor, were weal|thy; they live by them&s;elves in a &s;eparate part of the town, where they are &s;hut out every night from the Moors; their women are remarkable for their clearne&s;s of complexion, and the beauty of their features.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="027216_0307_0FD3E1EDB8D84EA0">The port of Tetuan, is &s;ituated at about two miles di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and is named Marteen; at this place there is, however, only a &s;ingle hou&s;e, which is u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of collecting the cu&s;toms. As the mouth of the river on which it is &s;ituated, is now nearly choaked up with &s;and, it only admits of &s;mall craft; and even the&s;e can proceed no further than Marteen, where there are u&s;ually a few of the emperor's row-gallies laid up to winter.</P>
<P>The entrance of the river is defended by a high and &s;quare tower, on which are mounted twelve pieces of cannon. This fortification might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of preventing the approach of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, but it is by no means calculated to oppo&s;e any con&s;iderable force. The bay, or more proper|ly the road, of Tetuan, is formed by a high point of land which runs out into the &s;ea a con&s;iderable di&s;tance to the We&s;t of the river, and will only &s;helter ve&s;&s;els in a we&s;terly wind; when it veers round to the Ea&s;tward, they are obliged to leave the bay, and retire to &s;ome &s;afer port.</P>
<P>During my continuance at Tetuan, I was not inattentive to the main object of this expedition: but, as the information which I could collect there, was not materially different from what I learned at Tangier, I &s;hall blend the different accounts to|gether, and ha&s;ten to gratify the reader's curio&s;ity, as far as it lies in my power, concerning the &s;uc|ceeding events which took place in the empire, from the time of my leaving Morocco to the ac|ce&s;&s;ion and death of the late emperor. The infor|mation which I obtained in con&s;equence of my &s;econd vi&s;it to Barbary, concerning the events that
<PB N="300" REF="027216_0308_0FD3E1EF18CD78D8">
took place in the empire &s;ub&s;equent to the death of Sidi Mahomet, and which I communicated in my fir&s;t edition, were the mo&s;t authentic and be&s;t I could, in the &s;hort time I was in the country, procure; &s;ince my return to Gibraltar, however, &s;everal new circum&s;tances have ari&s;en, which have obliged me to alter both my original plan and &s;en|timents, and to carry on my narrative up to the death of Muley Yazid, who&s;e conduct will now appear in a very different light to what it did at the fir&s;t view. The difficulty of obtaining an im|partial account of the politics of a country in which individuals are cautious to a degree how they expre&s;s their &s;entiments, will be deemed, I hope, a &s;ufficient apology for my conci&s;ene&s;s on this &s;ubject, as well as for any errors into which I inadvertently may have fallen.</P>
<P>Muley Yazid, who&s;e mother is the offspring of an Engli&s;h renegado, having incurred, a few years ago, his father's di&s;plea&s;ure, was &s;ent on a pilgrimage to Mecca; the old emperor hoping, that by &s;eeing the world he would, in a maturer age, reform, and be brought to a &s;en&s;e of his duty.</P>
<P>Upon his approaching the frontiers, about four years ago, very &s;trong and &s;eemingly authentic reports were circulated, that he was on his march with a large army to dethrone his father. The&s;e rumours could not fail to affect the old man with con&s;iderable anxiety, which, however, was after|wards removed by the retreat of Muley Yazid to Tunis, without having made any ho&s;tile exertions whatever.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1789 the prince privately entered the country, and took refuge, as has al|ready
<PB N="301" REF="027216_0309_0FD3E1F3EB5A3888">
been intimated, in a &s;anctuary named Muley Ab&s;ulem. To this &s;acred &s;pot, which is held in great veneration by the Moors, he retired as a place of &s;afety, without any intention of attacking his father, but merely to remain there in readine&s;s to declare him&s;elf, when the emperors death &s;hould take place, which, from his great age and infirmi|ties, was evidently an event which could not be very di&s;tant. Here he had no people about him, but three or four faithful attendants, and lived a &s;trictly retired life, as far removed as can well be conceived from that &s;tate and con&s;equence which are u&s;ually affected by princes.</P>
<P>The old emperor, however, con&s;idered his &s;on's intentions in a far different point of view, and u&s;ed every &s;tratagem he could invent to draw him out of the &s;anctuary, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At one time he wrote him word, that if he would come to court, he would rein&s;tate him in his affections, and acquie&s;ce in every demand he would make, or, if he cho&s;e to leave the country, he would allow him &s;ufficient to live in Turkey, or at Mecca, re&s;pected as a prince. On another occa&s;ion he threatened to attack him, pull down the &s;anctuary, and take him away by force. To all the&s;e letters, the prince, by the prudent advice of his mother, with whom he kept up a private corre&s;pondence, always evaded giving a po&s;itive an&s;wer. He a&s;&s;ured his father of his affection, duty, and the purity of his intentions; and, with|out refu&s;ing to acquie&s;ce in his wi&s;hes, &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome excu&s;e or other, explaining why he could not for the pre&s;ent comply, but promi&s;ing that he would &s;oon.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="027216_0310_0FD3E1F46B4554E0">It is difficult to conjecture, whether the emperor would have u&s;ed any violence towards his &s;on, in ca&s;e he had repaired to court. But it is well known, that the old monarch wi&s;hed particularly, that Muley Ab&s;ulem might be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and that he had a private di&s;like to Muley Yazid; which were &s;ufficient motives for the prudent conduct of the latter.</P>
<P>The various reports that were circulated through the country, and particularly by the people at court, that Muley Yazid's intentions were ho&s;tile to his father, and the great e&s;teem in which he knew he was held by every individual in the country, made the emperor con&s;ider this &s;on as a very dangerous rival.</P>
<P>I have already &s;o fully repre&s;ented the &s;tate in which the emperor was at that period, that it would be only a repetition to expatiate on it at pre|&s;ent. It will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that after three or four months un&s;ucce&s;sful negociations, the em|peror &s;ent down his &s;on Muley Ha&s;em to Tangier, with an army of &s;ix thou&s;and Negroes, which were to be reinforced by men drawn from the neighbouring provinces. The prince's directions were, to offer a con&s;iderable reward from the emperor to the per&s;ons who had the care of the &s;anctuary, if they would &s;urrender or expel Muley Yazid; but if they refu&s;ed to comply with this reque&s;t, he was to pull down the &s;anctuary, to &s;eize Muley Yazid; and put every man, woman, and child, in the neighbourhood, to the &s;word. This &s;anguinary edict, however, the Sharifs had &s;pirit or enthu&s;ia&s;m enough to re&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pag 156, where this order of the emperor re&s;pect|ing Muley Yazid, and the Sharifs rea&s;ons for not obeying it, are fully explained.</NOTE>, and Muley

Ha&s;em, not having &s;ecured the confidence of his troops, was afraid to attack his brother. When they were encamped at Tangier, he did not even venture to &s;leep among them, but at night always retired to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted with this fruitle&s;s attempt, the em|peror called his &s;on a coward and a trifler; and immediately ordered Alcaide Abbas, the com|mander in chief of the black army, and the be&s;t officer in his &s;ervice, to &s;upercede Muley Ha&s;em in the command. Abbas carried a con&s;iderable reinforcement to the army already at Tangier, and was &s;oon after joined by Muley Slemma, the late emperors full brother. The&s;e two officers were directed to encamp near the &s;anctuary, and wait there till joined by the emperor him&s;elf, with a con|&s;iderable army from the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the emperor left Morocco on the 29th March 1790, and travelled on hor&s;e|back. At the time he was pa&s;&s;ing out at the gate of the city, the umbrella, which is always carried before the emperor, and in that country is the di&s;tinctive mark of royalty, &s;uddenly broke in two, and the head was carried up in the air to a con|&s;iderable height before it fell.</P>
<P>That the en&s;ign of royalty &s;hould be in &s;o un|accountable a manner broken, at the very moment of his departure on a journey, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of which the fate of his empire &s;eemed to de|pend, was an accident which the emperor, who was remarkably &s;uper&s;titious, con&s;idered as a
<PB N="304" REF="027216_0312_0FD3E1F80E5DDB40">
bad omen, and he was certain portended &s;ome calamity which was to befal him on the road.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions he became remarkably unea&s;y, pen&s;ive, and indi&s;po&s;ed; and it is not improbable that this trifling circum&s;tance, united to a previous weak &s;tate of body and mind, contributed materially to ha&s;ten his death.</P>
<P>From the time of his departure till the &s;econd of April he made unu&s;ually &s;hort &s;tages; and on that day he ordered letters to be written to Muley Slemma and Alcaide Abbas, in very &s;trong terms arraigning the conduct of Muley Yazid, and directing them to encamp at the bottom of the mountain on which the &s;anctuary was &s;ituated, and to block it up in &s;uch a manner, that the prince &s;hould not find it po&s;&s;ible to make his e&s;cape. Soon after the &s;igning of the&s;e letters, he complained of a pain in his head and &s;tomach, and was &s;eized with vomiting. He contined, there|fore, for the &s;pace of two days, without being able to proceed on his journey. On the 5th of April, as he found him&s;elf unable to ride on hor&s;e|back, he ordered his people to place him in his litter, and commanded his own phy&s;ician to ac|company him. When he halted on his journey, in the evening, he was vi&s;ited by a large body of people, who came to pay their re&s;pects to him. For the&s;e adventitious vi&s;itors the &s;overeign ordered a great fea&s;t to be prepared; he ta&s;ted of every di&s;h that was &s;ent to them, and &s;oon after complained of a pain in his bowels.</P>
<P>On the following day he proceeded on his journey, and in the evening the pains of his head and &s;tomach were con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, and were
<PB N="305" REF="027216_0313_0FD3E1F996754480">
&s;oon after followed by a vomiting of blood. He now began to expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of his approaching di&s;&s;olution; and, it is &s;aid, ordered a letter to be written to Muley Yazid, telling him, that he hoped God would forgive him, and ble&s;s him; but, as the truth of this circum&s;tance is di&s;puted, I give it as a mere report.</P>
<P>His unea&s;ine&s;s concerning his &s;ituation did not prevent him from regularly and devoutly perform|ing every part of his ablutions and prayers, and fulfilling every ceremony of his religion. On the two &s;ucceeding days the emperor took very &s;hort journies, and, finding he had no pro&s;pect of a recovery, he de&s;ired that his women would have him carried to Rabat, and buried in a vault which he had built in his palace for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 11th of April, upon entering the town of Rabat, he expired in his carriage, without &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. The news of his death was not made public till the following day, when he was buried in his palace, agreeably to his orders, with all the honours u&s;ually paid to &s;uch per|&s;onages.</P>
<P>The death of Sidi Mahomet was certainly a mo&s;t fortunate event for the people of the Northern provinces, and particularly for tho&s;e who had manife&s;ted any attachment to Muley Yazid. His intention, indeed, was no le&s;s than the total ex|tirpation of all the inhabitants; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee where his cruelties might have termi|nated. On the other hand, it was not the intention of Muley Yazid to come to any engagement with his father; therefore, as the emperor approached,
<PB N="306" REF="027216_0314_0FD3E1FBEC221C68">
he would have retired, till he had got beyond the boundaries of his fathers dominions.</P>
<P>Sidi Mahomet, when he died, was in the 81&s;t year of his age, and the 33d of his reign. His character has already occupied &s;o large a portion of the&s;e pages, that it would be entirely &s;uperfluous to make any additions.</P>
<P>It is well known that, a few months previous to his death, he was thoroughly convinced how greatly he had fallen a dupe to Spani&s;h intrigues. By bribing the mini&s;ters, and ob&s;curing the mental eye of the &s;overeign by large and repeated pre|&s;ents, the court of Spain procured leave to export great quantities of corn free of duty, the cu&s;toms of which, at a moderate computation, would have brought him in five times the value of the pre&s;ents he received. This indeed was not the only incon|venience which the country &s;uffered through this imprudent conce&s;&s;ion; for the drought had been &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, the preceding year, that a &s;carcity of corn had already taken place, and occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al murmur among the people: &s;o that had the exportation of that article been allowed a little time longer, a general famine, and con|&s;equently an univer&s;al rebellion, mu&s;t have taken place. Be&s;ides this, out of pique to the Engli&s;h, the Spaniards engaged the emperor to refu&s;e the &s;upplying of Gibraltar with provi&s;ions, by which another con&s;iderable defalcation was made in his revenue. Latterly, however, the monarch was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e impo&s;itions, that he rai&s;ed the duties upon tho&s;e provi&s;ions and corn which the Spaniards exported, to &s;o immoderate a height,
<PB N="307" REF="027216_0315_0FD3E1FC39E3D300">
that they were obliged to &s;end home their ve&s;&s;els empty.</P>
<P>Had he lived to this time, it is a matter of doubt, whether affairs with Spain would have ended only by increa&s;ing the duties; for he was &s;o entirely irritated by their conduct, that it is not improbable that a rupture between the two courts would have been the con&s;equence. On the other hand, his differences with England, from the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, would have been mo&s;t probably adju&s;ted and &s;ettled, perfectly to the &s;atisfaction of our court. Indeed he had given directions for that purpo&s;e two days previous to his death.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned that in this country the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the empire, though re&s;tricted to the &s;ame family, is not limited to any particular branch, but depends on the influence each of the princes may have in the country, and particularly on the army. The government may therefore be con&s;idered as partly hereditary, and partly elec|tive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mahometan law particularly directs, and it is well under&s;tood by the more enlightened part of the Moors, that the elde&s;t &s;on, is the next heir to the throne; but owing to the influence of the black army, and the ignorance of the majority of the people, this circum&s;tance in the em|pire of Morocco is but &s;eldom attended to.</NOTE>. Wealth, however, is not the only means of obtaining this influence; for Muley Yazid, the late emperor, was the poore&s;t of the royal brothers.</P>
<P>When the news of the emperor's death reached Muley Slemma and Alcaide Abbas, they certainly fell back with the army towards Sallee; but what|ever they might have in view by &s;o doing, they
<PB N="308" REF="027216_0316_0FD3E1FD4DF1D300">
could meet with no &s;upport. At Morocco, the old emperor left his two &s;ons Muley Ha&s;em and Muley Ou&s;&s;ine entru&s;ted with the joint government of that city, ordering the inhabitants to pay to the fir&s;t prince the &s;um of ten thou&s;and hard dollars, and the latter five. The partiality, however of the monarch, &s;o greatly irritated Muley Ou&s;&s;ine, that he di&s;charged a mu&s;quet at his brother upon &s;ome ca&s;ual di&s;pute, but mi&s;&s;ed him. Muley Ha&s;em, who at Tangier had manife&s;ted a want of re&s;olu|tion, intimidated by this conduct of his brother, retired, &s;hut him&s;elf up in the palace, and left Muley Ou&s;&s;ine in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole of the money.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Muley Ha&s;em received intelligence of his father's death, he publi&s;hed it to the people of Morocco, at the &s;ame time pre&s;enting him&s;elf as the immediate heir of the crown. He was &s;oon after proclaimed by a few mountaineers; but the principal people of the city declaring in favour of Muley Yazid, Muley Ha&s;em was obliged to give up his pretentions, and retire to his late father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Muley Ou&s;&s;ine took the fir&s;t opportunity of leaving Morocco, and repaired to Muley Abdra|haman, who re&s;ided among the Arabs in the mo&s;t &s;outhern part of Suz. His motives for this &s;tep are differently acccounted for. It is by &s;ome attributed to an apprehen&s;ion of the new empe|ror's re&s;entment, on account of the robbery he had committed on Muley Ha&s;em; while others allege it was on the &s;core of having formerly killed one of Muley Yazid's children.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="027216_0317_0FD3E2036CFB9C18">Muley Abdrahaman had, during his father's life, ama&s;&s;ed a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money, by his indu&s;try and attention to commercial affairs, and was at one time in great favour with his father. The old man, however, of who&s;e immoderate love of riches I have already had occa&s;ion to &s;peak, &s;oon became jealous of his &s;on's wealth, and con|&s;equently de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it. To effect his purpo&s;e without oppo&s;ition, he di&s;&s;embled his in|tentions &s;o far as to appoint his &s;on governor of Sallee, a place of no incon&s;iderable importance; and, in con&s;equence of this appointment, Muley Abdrahaman, having packed up all his money and valuables on mules, in the mo&s;t affectionate man|ner took leave of his father, and proceeded on his journey. He had not, however, long pro|ceeded in peace, before the emperor &s;ent a large detachment of troops after him, with orders to &s;trip him of every article in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; which they &s;o effectually accompli&s;hed, that they left him ma&s;ter only of an old ru&s;ty pi&s;tol. While the prince, naturally irritated by &s;uch unworthy treat|ment, made a ra&s;h but mo&s;t &s;olemn vow, that he would never &s;ee his father's face again; and he immediately retired to the mountains in Suz, where he has continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The emperor endeavoured to per&s;uade his &s;on to return to court, by offering him large pre&s;ents of money, and by the mo&s;t &s;plended promi&s;es; but the prince always an&s;wered, that he never could comply with his father's reque&s;t, as he was convinced his word was not to be tru&s;ted. Upon which the old monarch included him in the cur&s;e he had uttered again&s;t Muley Yazid.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="027216_0318_0FD3E2048F8F13F8">When the emperor's death came to be known in Suz, forty thou&s;and Arabs immediately tendered their &s;pontaneous &s;ervices to a&s;&s;i&s;t Muley Abdraha|man in a&s;cending the throne, and in re&s;i&s;ting the preten&s;ions of Muley Yazid; and it was general|ly expected that he would have made the attempt, as the following letter was received from him by the new emperor while he re&s;ided at Fez. I in&s;ert it as a &s;pecimen of Moori&s;h compo&s;ition, and at Moori&s;h politene&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>I have heard of my father's death, and that you have left the &s;anctuary, and call your&s;elf emperor.&mdash;Go to your hole, you rat, or meet me at Morocco; where I will convince you, that Fez is not a place for an emperor.</Q></P>
<P>Though this was the only prince, in who&s;e power it was to make any &s;erious oppo&s;ition to Muley Yazid; yet he &s;ince gave up that intention, wrote a letter of congratulation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his brother, and made an offer of his &s;ervices. Thus amid&s;t &s;o many difficulties, and with &s;o many competitors, all of them con&s;idering them|&s;elves as equally entitled to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was Muley Yazid &s;eated on the throne without the &s;hedding of a drop of blood, and almo&s;t as peace|ably as in the be&s;t-regulated &s;tate in Europe.</P>
<P>If we look back on the changes of ma&s;ters which this empire had previou&s;ly experienced, I believe we &s;hall &s;carcely find an in&s;tance where affairs have been &s;ettled &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully and happily as on this occa&s;ion. The only di&s;turbances that took place after the old emperor's death, were &s;ome predatory incur&s;ions of the Arabs into the &s;ourthern provinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who, under a pretence of &s;upporting

Muley Ha&s;em, plundered Morocco, and obliged the Chri&s;tians and Jews to take &s;helter in the ca&s;tle. Mogodore was &s;aved by being &s;o well fortified, and by the great exertions of the governor and inhabitants. The country, however, adjacent to tho&s;e places, even as far as Sallee, was in &s;uch a &s;tate of confu&s;ion that travelling became totally impracticable for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>The town of Dar Beyda, which is garri&s;oned by about an hundred and fifty Negroes, who on &s;everal occa&s;ions had made them&s;elves di&s;agreeable to the &s;urrounding Arabs, nearly &s;hared the &s;ame fate as Morocco. As &s;oon as the emperor's death was made known there, the Arabs bought up all the powder and ball that was in the town, before the inhabitants were aware of their intentions. For balls, which were u&s;ually &s;old at the price of eight or nine for a blanquil, the Arabs now con&s;ented to purcha&s;e at the rate of two blanquils each, and at la&s;t they completely &s;tripped the town of all its &s;mall ammunition. Having effected this fir&s;t &s;tep, they a&s;&s;embled in great numbers in the neigh|bourhood of the town, armed with mu&s;quets.</P>
<P>The governor, alarmed at the appearance of &s;o con&s;iderable a body of Arabs, went out with fifty &s;oldiers, and demanded of them their intentions in thus tumultuou&s;ly a&s;&s;embling together. They re|plied, that as the country and town people were both equally &s;ubjects of the empire, it became nece&s;|&s;ary that deputations from each party &s;hould meet in the town, to determine upon the per&s;on proper to be elected their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>In return, the governor an&s;wered, that he had no objection whatever to a few of their principal
<PB N="312" REF="027216_0320_0FD3E2089DBFB518">
people coming into the town, for the purpo&s;e they mentioned; but that he could not &s;ee any rea&s;on who &s;o many per&s;ons &s;hould on &s;uch an occa&s;ion be collected together, and pre&s;ent them|&s;elve in a ho&s;tile &s;tate again&s;t a city of the empire. To this ob&s;ervation the Arabs did not conde&s;cend to reply, bet in&s;i&s;ted upon being admitted into the town; and were as ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed. After &s;ome parlying, however, they promi&s;ed to di&s;per&s;e, if the governor would pay them two thou&s;and dollars. This he refu&s;ed, ob&s;erving, that in making this demand they were treating the inhabitants of the town like Jews; and that they mu&s;t di&s;per&s;e, or take the con&s;equence. A reply of this nature was calculated to enrage in&s;tead of conciliating the Arabs, and they began to &s;et the huts on fire, and at the &s;ame time continued to advance towards the town.</P>
<P>Their force at this period was increa&s;ing almo&s;t every moment, by numbers who came down from the mountains; and the governor, apprehending immediate danger to the town, privately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the inhabitants, cautioning them to be on their guard again&s;t the Arabs, and at the &s;ame time announcing that he had no opportunity of retiring him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As the town had been previou&s;ly cleared of its flints, powder, and ball, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe the con&s;ternation of the people. To add to their di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, which had am|munition on board, had the day before before been unfortunately driven, by bad weather, out of the bay, and the town appeared de&s;titute of every re|&s;ource. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spani&s;h hou&s;e, however, which was
<PB N="313" REF="027216_0321_0FD3E20A11A1CF28">
&s;ettled at Dar Beyda, and had very con&s;iderable property in the place, advi&s;ed the inhabitants to clo&s;e the gates immediately, and to mount on the wall fronting the enemy an old twelve pounder, which was without a carriage, and was the only piece of ordnance in the place. At the &s;ame time they offered three dollars to every man, who would a&s;&s;i&s;t in defending the ramparts. Having mounted the gun on the wall, they were &s;till at a lo&s;s for one of the mo&s;t material articles, viz. pow|der; there was &s;ome in the magazine, but the gover|nor was on the out&s;ide, and had the key in his cu&s;|tody. The Spaniards advi&s;ed them by all means, upon &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing emergency, to break open the door of the magazine, which they immediately did, and with powder only fired off their piece of cannon among the Arabs.</P>
<P>An attack &s;o unexpected upon the Arabs, who had flattered them&s;elves that there was neither a gun or powder in the place, put them for &s;ome time into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and they be|gan to di&s;per&s;e. But upon finding that no per&s;on was wounded, they &s;oon a&s;&s;embled again, with a full determination to attack the town. The Spaniards now advi&s;ed the people to load the piece with a ball, which they by accident found, and fire it directly among them. This manoeuvre was attended with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. The Arabs immediately di&s;per&s;ed, and gave the gover|nor time to re-enter the town with his troops; and at length, being &s;en&s;ible that they could effect nothing by a regular attack, they next attempted to take the place by &s;tratagem. For this purpo&s;e, they divided them&s;elves into two parties; one was
<PB N="314" REF="027216_0322_0FD3E20E98EC5348">
po&s;ted on the right &s;ide of the town, and the other on the left. The party on the right &s;ide &s;ent in a deputation to the governor, informing him that they were friends, and reque&s;ting that they might be let into the town, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in conquering tho&s;e on the left, who were enemies, from whom they had de&s;erted. This propo&s;al, however, was ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed on the part of the governor, who de&s;ired them to keep at a di&s;tance, or take the con&s;equence; upon this the two parties again united, and endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e the town on the water &s;ide.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els, which had been driven out the day before, returning about this time, powder, balls, and a few &s;mall pieces of cannon were taken out of them; and when the Arabs made their la&s;t attack, by night, the town took the alarm, fired on them, and obliged them to retire. The following day the pieces of cannon were mounted in different parts on the walls of the town, which had the de&s;ired effect; for the Arabs, finding they had no chance of &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;per&s;ed totally, and went to their different homes. For &s;ome time after this circum&s;tance, not one of them was permitted to enter the town, but upon condition that he &s;hould fir&s;t leave his mu&s;quet and &s;word on the out&s;ide of the gate.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h hou&s;e, during this petty &s;iege, &s;upplied the late emperor's women, who happened to be in the town, on this occa&s;ion, with money and other nece&s;&s;aries, and out of their own &s;tores furni&s;hed corn to the inhabitants. The new &s;overeign was &s;o plea&s;ed with the conduct of the Spaniards, that he &s;ent them a letter of thanks,
<PB N="315" REF="027216_0323_0FD3E2120D76EE10">
as well for their zeal in defending the town, as for the &s;upport they afforded to his father's women. Not &s;ati&s;fied, however, with the barren return of thanks, he ordered them al&s;o to be repaid the whole of their expences, and &s;ent them a pre&s;ent of two lions.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal di&s;turbances which took place, in con&s;equence of the emperor's death. By degrees the &s;pirit for plunder, on the part of the Arabs, was le&s;s general, and the country became in a &s;tate of perfect peace and tranquility.</P>
<P>The news of the emperor's death reached Tan|gier on the 15th of April; upon which the gover|nor repaired to the great mo&s;que, made a &s;hort prayer for Sidi Mahomet, and proclaimed Muley Yazid his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. After this ceremony, the public crier was placed in a con&s;picuous &s;ituation, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> publicly proclaimed Muley Yazid; in his name denouncing the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment again&s;t any per&s;on, who &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e the new &s;overeign.</P>
<P>As Muley Yazid had been proclaimed both in the church and in the town, the con&s;uls all agreed to write him a letter, condoling with him on his father's decea&s;e, and congratulating him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that the only ceremony attending a new emperor's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, is a public proclamation in the &s;treets and mo&s;ques. When the proclama|tion takes place in the pre&s;ence of the emperor, which by the law ought to be performed publicly, at lea&s;t in the three capitals of the empire, it is cu&s;tomary for all the chief prie&s;ts and doctors of
<PB N="316" REF="027216_0324_0FD3E213160563E0">
law to a&s;&s;emble, with the other great people of the town, and for the Mufti or Cadi to read aloud to the emperor, a &s;hort recapitulation of &s;ome of the laws of the Koran; which direct, that he &s;hall pre&s;erve the empire, admini&s;ter &s;peedy ju&s;tice, protect the innocent, de&s;troy the wicked, and &s;o far from countenancing and keeping near his &s;acred per&s;on any adulterer, that he &s;hall puni&s;h adultery, prevent the exportation of corn and pro|vi&s;ions to the prejudice of the people, tax provi&s;ions according to their plenty or &s;carcity, and forbid u&s;ury to be exerci&s;ed towards the poor, which is an abomination before God. He is told, that if he breaks the&s;e articles, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed, as he ought to puni&s;h others under a &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ceremony is performed before all Ba&s;haws, Alcaides, and Shaiks, upon their fir&s;t receiving their appointment. How far the&s;e few but excellent admonitions are attended to, either by the emperor or the officers under his command, I have already &s;ufficiently explained in a former part of the narrative.</P>
<P>On the &s;ucceeding day, which was the Moori&s;h &s;abbath, all the great people of the town a&s;&s;embled at the mo&s;ques, and, with greater ceremony than the day before; prayed for the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed &s;overeign, and proclaimed Muley Yazid his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. On the &s;ame day all the Jewe&s;&s;es of Tan|gier were ordered by the governor to repair to the ca&s;tle, and lament Sidi Mahomet's death; which they performed by loud &s;hrieks and la|mentations.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="027216_0325_0FD3E214AC5F5060">On the 17th, the ba&s;haw communicated to the con&s;uls a letter, which he had received from Muley Yazid at the &s;anctuary, wherein he ordered the ba&s;haw to conduct all the con&s;uls to him with their pre&s;ents, under a guard of fifteen &s;oldiers. On the &s;ame day a &s;alute of twenty-one guns was fired from the battery, in con&s;equence of an order having arrived for a general relea&s;e and pardon to all pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Seven poor &s;harifs or petty princes, who brought this order, delivered at the &s;ame time directions to the con&s;uls to clothe them from head to foot at their own expence. In con&s;equence of this, the con&s;uls furni&s;hed each of them with cloth for a caftan, with two britannias, and twenty dollars; to this, as it was not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy them, they were obliged to add a &s;till further &s;upply of money. On the following day the con&s;uls &s;et off on their journey with the ba&s;haw, and the principal people of the town both, Moors and Jews. In the even|ing, Reis Mu&s;ti Galli, with two other &s;ea cap|tains, arrived at the con&s;ul's camp with a letter from the new emperor, inviting them to repair to him at Tetuan, and promi&s;ing to renew the ancient treaties of peace and commerce with their nations. The captains related, that Muley Yazid had left the &s;anctuary, and had made his public entrance into Tetuan the day before.</P>
<P>On the 19th of April the con&s;uls arrived in the evening at Tetuan, where upon entering the gates, they were met by a me&s;&s;enger, who informed them that the emperor would give them audience im|mediately, whil&s;t upon their hor&s;es; upon which their baggage was all &s;ent away, and the con&s;uls
<PB N="318" REF="027216_0326_0FD3E2160B3BD2F0">
all ranged them&s;elves in a regular form. After waiting, however, a &s;hort time, another me&s;&s;enger came to acquaint them, that the emperor would &s;ee them the next day. On the following day, at twelve o'clock at noon, the con&s;uls were &s;ent for to the emperor's camp, where they found the &s;overeign on hor&s;eback, in a very rich Turki&s;h dre&s;s, and his hor&s;e ornamented with Turki&s;h furniture.</P>
<P>After having a&s;ked their re&s;pective names and titles, the emperor told the con&s;uls he was at peace with the Engli&s;h and Ragou&s;i, but at war with all the other nations; who&s;e con&s;uls he allowed only four months to retire from his dominions with their property, and ordered them to &s;end him back every thing which belonged to his &s;ubjects. On the 22d of April, the con&s;uls had their &s;econd audience, at which each of them brought their &s;eparate pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The emperor now told them, he would remain at peace with all their nations on the &s;ame footing as before, requiring of the Spaniards only an amba&s;&s;ador within four months. At this audience he promi&s;ed the con&s;uls letters to their re&s;pective courts, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame &s;entiments; and a&s;&s;ured them that the ba&s;haw at Tangier &s;hould make them out, in terms mo&s;t agreeable to the con&s;uls. The &s;ucceding day the con&s;uls received orders to return to Tangier, at which place the emperor was to deliver to them the papers he had promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 25th of the &s;ame month, the emperor arrived at Tangier, and the day following was waited upon by all the con&s;uls, to congratulate
<PB N="319" REF="027216_0327_0FD3E21731B5B158">
him on his &s;afe arrival. The emperor continued at Tangier till the 29th, during which time he gave private audiences to tho&s;e con&s;uls who a&s;ked them. He was every day fully employed by people who came from the different provinces to pay their homage to him. The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and. The ba&s;haw of Tangier, who had the commi&s;&s;ion to write out the letters which the con&s;uls were to &s;end home to their re&s;pective courts, behaved in the mo&s;t arbi|trary and in&s;olent manner towards tho&s;e gentlemen. He demanded of &s;ome no le&s;s than two thou&s;and, of others fifteen hundred dollars, for the trouble he had taken, by interfering in their favour with the new &s;overeign; at the &s;ame time po&s;itively re|fu&s;ing to make out or deliver the letters till they had either paid the &s;um he exacted, or given him &s;ecurity for it.</P>
<P>After the con&s;uls had endeavoured to &s;atisfy the ba&s;haw in the be&s;t manner they were able, they at la&s;t did not receive the letters till the day after the emperor's departure from Tangier, when they were brought to them by the ba&s;haw's &s;ecretary, and another of his attendants, who not only de|manded a pre&s;ent for them&s;elves, but al&s;o obliged them to pay an exorbitant price for the &s;eal on each paper, which the ba&s;haw pretended he had paid to the keeper of the &s;eals.</P>
<P>The emperor arrived on the 10th of May at Mequinez, whence, after &s;ome little &s;tay, he went to Fez, and there kept the fea&s;t of the Ramadam. About this period, in con&s;equence of the emperor's not having appeared in public for &s;everal days, a fal&s;e report was circulated, that he had been killed
<PB N="320" REF="027216_0328_0FD3E21D14C36248">
by his brother Muley Ha&s;&s;em, who had ju&s;t be|fore arrived at Fez from Morocco.</P>
<P>Having conducted the emperor to Mequinez, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;hort general view of his &s;ub&s;equent conduct, during the &s;hort time that elap&s;ed between his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and arrival at that city; and thence go on to tho&s;e circum&s;tances which led to the cau&s;e of his death. After the caprice, pu&s;illanimity, and avarice which had di&s;tingui&s;hed the reign of his predece&s;&s;or, Muley Yazid appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s many qualities well calculated to render him a very popular prince in the eyes of the Moors. To a tall, ele|gant, and maje&s;tic per&s;on, were united a hand&s;ome and expre&s;&s;ive countenance, which, with a &s;pecious and per&s;ua&s;ive addre&s;s, a generous and di&s;intere&s;ted but determined conduct, a great activity of body, and an uncommon agility in hor&s;eman&s;hip, were requi&s;ites which were certain of impre&s;&s;ing on the minds of his &s;ubjects a very favourable opinion of their new &s;overeign; and it is certain that Muley Yazid &s;ucceeded to the throne by the voluntary choice of the majority of the people. Happy it had been, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient virtue or policy to have pre&s;erved this good opinion which they had formed; but his ungovernable propen&s;ity to cruelty and drunkenne&s;s, which he had art|fully concealed in his minority, he had not re&s;olu|tion &s;ufficient to command when he &s;ucceeded to the throne; and in the whole hi&s;tory of Mo|rocco, we do not meet with a tyrant who exer|ci&s;ed greater barbarities than this mon&s;ter was guilty of.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="027216_0329_0FD3E21FF4D2C038">His fir&s;t &s;tep after leaving the &s;anctuary, was to repair to Tetuan, where he immediately ordered a general plunder of the Jews to be put in execu|tion by his black troops, in con&s;equence of an in|&s;ult he had received from that people upon a for|mer occa&s;ion. In pur&s;uance of this edict, their hou&s;es were in&s;tantly ran&s;acked, the furniture which could not be carried off, was de&s;troyed and thrown into the &s;treets, &s;ome of the owners were put to death, and others were &s;everely beaten; and the per&s;ons of the wives and daughters violated by the outrageous &s;oldiery, who indi&s;criminately &s;tripped them even of their clothes, and turned them naked into the &s;treets. It is not po&s;&s;ible to paint in ju&s;t colours, the di&s;tre&s;s and hard&s;hip that unfortunate race experienced for &s;everal days, till a conclu&s;ion was put to their per&s;ecutions by an order from the emperor, who, in con&s;equence of a pardon to the Jews, threatened death to every per&s;on who &s;hould in any degree further mole&s;t them.</P>
<P>There were two per&s;ons of this nation, of &s;ome con&s;equence, whom Muley Yazid marked out as particular objects of his revenge. The fir&s;t was a Jew, who, in the character of Spani&s;h vice con&s;ul, had committed &s;ome act during the reign of Sidi Mahomet, which the new emperor con&s;idered as having been inimical to his intere&s;ts. For this real or imaginary crime, the culprit was &s;u&s;pended by a cord pa&s;&s;ed through the tendons of the lower part of the legs, with his head downwards; in which &s;ituation, without any &s;u&s;tenance, he con|tinued alive for near four days, when the emperor ordered his head to be taken off, by way of re|lieving
<PB N="322" REF="027216_0330_0FD3E22151D70FF8">
him from his mi&s;ery. The other per&s;on was Jacob Attal, who in a former part of the work has already been noticed as the favourite of Sidi Mahomet. There is great rea&s;on to believe that this young man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable abili|ties, was acce&s;&s;ary to his own unhappy fate, by his too bu&s;y interference in politics, which occa&s;ion|ed him many enemies at court, who were now glad of &s;eizing the oportunity of gratifying their re|venge, by per&s;uading the emperor that he was one of tho&s;e who, in the court of Sidi Mahomet, had been particularly inimical to him. Attal con|&s;cious of his danger, put him&s;elf under the pro|tection of the Engli&s;h con&s;ul, with an intention of accompanying that gentleman to Tetuan, in hopes that a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent of money, might in|duce the emperor to treat him with &s;ome lenity. Unfortunately, before this plan could be put in execution, an order for &s;eizing Attal met the party on the road, upon which the unfortunate Jew was forced off his mule, &s;tripped of his dre&s;s, and in an old Moori&s;h frock, and with a cord about his neck, was driven on foot with whips to Tetuan. Upon his arrival, he was immediately conducted to the emperor, who ordered both his hands to be cut off, in which &s;tate he continued three days in the greate&s;t mi&s;ery, and then he was de|capitated.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e by no means the only in&s;tances of cruelty that were exerci&s;ed upon the Jews. Tho&s;e of mo&s;t of the towns of the empire, were either plundered or obliged to pay the emperor a very heavy fine; and at Mequinez, and &s;ome other places, &s;everal were put to cruel deaths; and
<PB N="323" REF="027216_0331_0FD3E22305746490">
their wives and daughter left to the mercy of the black troops, who treated them with the greate&s;t indecencies.</P>
<P>A third object of the emperor's per&s;onal revenge was Alcaide Abbas, his father's black general: with re&s;pect to this officer, the emperor had two motives for puni&s;hing him. In the fir&s;t place, he was the commander of that very army which was intended for his own de&s;truction; and, in the &s;econd, upon his father's decea&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;ur|rendering the army to Muley Yazid, he with|drew it to the Southward, and, it was &s;uppo&s;ed with an intention of &s;upporting Muley Slemma.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, this conduct on the part of Abbas, the emperor certainly would not have put him to death, had it not been at the par|ticular reque&s;t of his black army, whom at that time he did not wi&s;h to offend. Abbas, fully con|&s;cious how much he was di&s;liked by his troops, attempted to make his e&s;cape to a &s;anctuary upon a very &s;wift hor&s;e; but his hor&s;e falling he was unluckily &s;eized, and immediately carried before the emperor, with very heavy charges on the part of his &s;oldiers. After a hearing of the charges, the emperor &s;ignified to the culprit that he might yet partake of his royal mercy, provided he would confine him&s;elf for two months to the &s;anctuary of Muley Ab&s;ulem. For this purpo&s;e he &s;et off; but he was again &s;eized by the &s;oldiers, who brought him back to the emperor with &s;till heavier charges; and the emperor, finding that the &s;oliers were determined on his de&s;truction, with his own hands, by one blow of his &s;abre, divided his head in two, and he immediately expired.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="027216_0332_0FD3CBD4D4108920">Abbas was the be&s;t officer in the emperor's &s;ervice, and never manife&s;ted the &s;lighte&s;t token of timidity, or conde&s;cended to a&s;k his life; on the contrary, when the emperor lifted up his &s;abre, he in a &s;tern and undaunted manner looked his &s;overeign in the face, and died with the countenance and the tranquility of a hero. As his body had not received the emperor's pardon, it remained on the ground unburied, to the great nui&s;ance of every per&s;on who pa&s;&s;ed that way. For &s;uch is the bar|barous cu&s;tom of the country, that when a man is put to death by the emperor, or his order, his body cannot be buried without its fir&s;t receiving a for|mal pardon from the emperor.</P>
<P>Muley Yazid, long before his father's death, had threatened the life of the Effendi. He had been a principal agent in exciting the father's hatred and prejudice again&s;t his &s;on. A further cau&s;e of the emperor's re&s;entment, was the great impo&s;ition practi&s;ed on his father by the Effendi re&s;pecting the corn bu&s;ine&s;s with the Spaniards, by which he had ama&s;&s;ed a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money in bribes and pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>Upon the emperor's death, the Effendi took refuge in a &s;anctuary, and, had he been wi&s;e, he would not have ventured abroad; but Muley Yazid having po&s;itively promi&s;ed to pardon him, he was induced to for&s;ake his a&s;ylum. For &s;ome time the new &s;overeign di&s;&s;embled his intentions, and waited for a favourable oportunity to &s;eize him. As &s;oon as he was taken, he offered the emperor two hundred thou&s;and dollars to &s;pare his life; but the monarch haughtily replied, that he wanted not his money, and that he would not conde&s;cend to
<PB N="325" REF="027216_0333_0FD3E22B80B676F0">
accept a bribe from a traitor. He then ordered his two hands to be cut off, in which &s;tate he &s;uf|fered him to remain for &s;ome days, and then commanded him to be beheaded. One of his hands was placed on the walls of Fez, and the other &s;ent down to Tangier, and ordered to be nailed on the door of the Spani&s;h con&s;ul, to con|vince that nation in what manner the emperor was di&s;po&s;ed to treat all the friends of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>The emperor always, indeed, manife&s;ted an exclu&s;ive preference to the Engli&s;h beyond all European nations, and on many other occa&s;ions, evinced an inveterate di&s;like to the Spaniards. From the moment of his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, he expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;approbation of the Spani&s;h mea|&s;ures, during his father's reign; and threatened to revenge him&s;elf very &s;hortly on that country. The Spaniards, who have more rea&s;on to wi&s;h for peace, from their ports being &s;o contiguous to the emperor's, as well as from the immen&s;e &s;up|plies which they procure from his dominions, than any other nation, endeavoured to ward off the threatening &s;torm, by very large and repeated pre&s;ents of money, and other valuable articles, to the emperor and his mini&s;ters. But this plan, which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the former reign, effected nothing in the pre&s;ent. Muley Yazid had, from his youth, been di&s;regardful of money; and, indeed, in his contempt of wealth, had even ex|ceeded the boundaries of prudence; he had al&s;o conceived a very &s;trong and very early predilection in favour of the Engli&s;h. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Spaniards &s;till continued to en|tertain
<PB N="326" REF="027216_0334_0FD3E22D9268FF58">
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in their negociations, till they heard of the death of the Effendi, their great friend and patron, and of the in&s;ult offered to their court, by the Effendi's hand being nailed on their con&s;ul's door. Such an affront was &s;ufficient to convince them, that war was inevitable; but they e&s;teemed it mo&s;t prudent to get their con&s;ul, and friars, out of the country, before they commenced ho&s;tilities; and a frigate for this purpo&s;e was di&s;|patched to Tangier. When they arrived there, they informed the governor, that they had on board a very valuable pre&s;ent for the emperor, and de&s;ired that he would &s;end proper per&s;ons to receive it. The con&s;ul and friars took this op|portunity of coming on board; and the frigate, having &s;ent off the Moors with the pre&s;ent, &s;et &s;ail, and the next day captured two Moori&s;h gallies off Larache, in &s;ight of the emperor, who was walking upon his terrace at the very moment. The valuable pre&s;ent which they carried, proved nothing more than huge bales of rags.</P>
<P>The&s;e repeated in&s;ults were not calculated to conciliate the emperor; he con&s;equently made im|mediate preparations for the attack on Ceuta, and &s;oon after be&s;ieged it. But this garri&s;on proved too &s;trongly fortified, both by nature and art, to render it po&s;&s;ible for the Moors to be &s;ucce&s;sful, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a naval power, and the emperor, after a fruitle&s;s &s;iege for &s;everal months with a very con&s;iderable army, was obliged to retire. The in&s;ults offered by the Spaniards in the decep|tion they employed to procure the relea&s;e of their con&s;ul and friars, and afterwads in the capture of the two Moori&s;h ve&s;&s;els, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion

on the emperor, that he threatened to put the town of Tangier to the &s;word, for &s;o flagrant a piece of neglect. In their ju&s;tification, the peo|ple informed their &s;overeign, that the error mu&s;t be imputed to the governor, who alone was re|&s;pon&s;ible for every circum&s;tance which happened within his di&s;trict. This officer, who at the ri&s;k of his life had &s;upported Muley Yazid in his minority with money, and afterwards placed him on the throne, for which the emperor took a &s;olemn oath that he would never do him or his family the &s;malle&s;t injury, was now thrown into irons, and immediately ordered into the royal pre&s;ence. The unfortunate man, fore&s;eeing his fate, reque&s;ted the emperor would do ju&s;tice to God and Ma|homet; to which he replied, "I mean to do ju&s;tice to my country by puni&s;hing a traitor;" and he im|mediately di&s;patched him with a mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>The numberle&s;s cruelties which were perpetrated by Muley Yazid, I have not &s;ufficient authentic information to authori&s;e me to detail, nor am I &s;ufficiently informed of the actual circum&s;tances of his reign, to be able to offer to the public a perfect narrative of it. Thus far I can ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert with truth, that he in a &s;hort time devoted him&s;elf entirely to the drinking of &s;trong <HI>liquors,</HI> which for the greate&s;t part of the day rendered him unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s, and excited him to the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelties; and, what was mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, where they were the lea&s;t de&s;erved; with &s;ome he amu&s;ed him&s;elf by galloping up with great violence and &s;pearing them, others were buried alive, while a third party were cut to pieces with &s;words.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="027216_0336_0FD3E230A0CDB098">It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that the neglect of public bu&s;ine&s;s, and the total in&s;ecurity of their per&s;ons from the tyranny of the monarch, de|&s;troyed in time intirely the confidence which the people had at fir&s;t placed in their &s;overeign, and encouraged Muley Ha&s;em, towards the latter part of the year 1791, to put him&s;elf at the head of an army in oppo&s;ition to his brother. This prince, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the bad, without any of the good qualities of the emperor, and who com|manded again&s;t him during the life of Sidi Mahomet, was further induced to this mea&s;ure in con&s;equence of a &s;upply of &s;tores, and con&s;ider|able &s;ums of money, which he received from the Spaniards, who had great rea&s;on to wi&s;h a change of government. The emperor, who &s;till had many friends, &s;oon collected a con&s;iderable army, with which he marched to the Southward to di&s;|lodge his brother, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Morocco and its vicinity. Muley Ha&s;em, upon this occa&s;ion, di&s;covered his u&s;ual pu&s;il|lanimity, by re&s;igning his command to one of his generals; who, however, was an active and enter|prizing officer. When the two armies met, a dreadful engagement en&s;ued. The emperor di&s;|covered an unco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on &s;hare of per&s;onal courage, intermixing with the enemy and fighting like a private &s;oldier. After a &s;evere conflict, he to|tally routed the enemy and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Morocco; but not before he had received &s;everal wounds which in a few days proved mortal. During the &s;hort period of life which remained to him, his whole attention was occupied in puni&s;hing the people of Morocco for their attach|ment

to his brother. Between two and three thou&s;and of the inhabitants, without regard to age or &s;ex, were ma&s;&s;acred in cold blood; while &s;ome of them he ordered to be nailed alive to the walls, he tore out the eyes of others with his own &s;purs, and, in his dying moments, pa&s;&s;ed an edict that &s;ixty people of Mogodore, among whom were mo&s;t of the European merchants, &s;hould be decapitated for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he &s;uppo&s;ed they had afforded to his brother. Fortunately for them, he died &s;oon after i&s;&s;uing the order, and it was not forwarded.</P>
<P>Muley Yazid, who only reigned two years, and at his death was in the forty-third year of his age, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many qualities, which, if they had been properly improved, would have rendered him a very u&s;eful monarch in a country where the &s;overeign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o much influence over his &s;ubjects; naturally quick of apprehen&s;ion, determined in his conduct, and not ea&s;ily bia&s;&s;ed by the per&s;ua&s;ion of others, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a great &s;hare of per&s;onal courage, and a total contempt of wealth; had the&s;e endowments of nature been meliorated by an enlightened education, they might have enabled him to have accompli&s;hed &s;ome reformation in his &s;ubjects, and perhaps led the way to &s;ome further impovement. Unfor|tunately this prince too ea&s;ily gave way to the dictate of his pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;oon totally inca|pacitated him from carrying on even the com|mon bu&s;ine&s;s of government; and rendered him as great a mon&s;ter as ever filled the throne of Morocco.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="027216_0338_0FD3E23673E45CE0">Since the death of Muley Yazid, the country has been in a very un&s;ettled &s;tate; the people be|ing now rendered extremely cautious how they elect another monarch. To the Southward of Sallee, Muley Ha&s;em, from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the army, is obeyed as the &s;overeign; while on the Northern &s;ide of the empire, Muley Solyman, who from his exemplary condu&s;t has gained the e&s;teem of the people, is con&s;idered as emperor. It now re&s;ts for time to determine which is to be the &s;uc|ce&s;sful candidate.</P>
