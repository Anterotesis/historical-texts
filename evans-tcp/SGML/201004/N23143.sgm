<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I MUST inform the reader, that the following pages, offered to his peru&s;al, have not been undertaken with a view of being made public. They are no more than the re&s;ult of &s;ome private le&s;&s;ons, dictated from memory, to a worthy and re&s;pectable family of this city, who&s;e education has been entru&s;ted to me. As I have had the &s;atisfaction of ob&s;erving that it has produced the happie&s;t effects in the minds of the children, for whom only I de&s;igned it, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve, that it will be equally u&s;eful and in&s;tructive to all tho&s;e who &s;hall care|fully peru&s;e it. The moral it contains is really good and excellent; and Oh! what finer moral than that, which tends to form the mind, the judgment, and the heart of young people! What finer mo|ral than that which makes them di&s;co|ver the advantages and nece&s;&s;ity of a
<PB N="iv" REF="030594_0003_0FE7F438140818F8">good education; which brings before their eyes tho&s;e ideas which, in all ages and in the be&s;t governments, have been entertained on this &s;ubject! What finer moral than that, which manife&s;ts and explains to them their duties; not only the duties which are impo&s;ed on them in youth, but even tho&s;e which they &s;hall have afterwards to di&s;charge at the different periods of life; not only the per&s;onal duties which concern them|&s;elves, but even the relative with re&s;pect to God, &s;ociety, and the different cla&s;&s;es of men with whom they have connec|tions, and are obliged to live! What finer moral than that, which teaches them to think, to reflect, to know them&s;elves and others; which gives them a ju&s;t conception of the intrin&s;ic value of things, and demon&s;trates to them in what real merit con&s;i&s;ts! What finer moral, in &s;hort, than that, which repre|&s;ents virtue as it really is, that is to &s;ay, amiable and de&s;irable in its very nature; which makes their attachment to their duties, even their intere&s;t and happine&s;s, by evincing, that to be happy, we mu&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="030594_0004_0FE7F43EC2373708">be religious, prudent, wi&s;e, humane, gentle, moderate, patient, ju&s;t, di&s;inte|re&s;ted, temperate, magnanimous, &amp;c. and rendering this <HI>great truth</HI> obvious to them, <HI>that virtue is the only road to felicity.</HI></P>
<P>Such, in few words, is the idea which the reader may form of this production; and &s;uch is the &s;ubject of it. It is nei|ther a plan, nor a &s;y&s;tem of public or private education. Nothing &s;y&s;tematic can be di&s;covered in its compo&s;ition. It is a &s;imple, conci&s;e explanation of the fundamental truths, and evident princi|ples, which &s;hould be at all times the great &s;pring of the actions and conduct of every good man, and which, con&s;e|quently, it is extremely important to inculcate and engrave on the hearts of youth. It is, as the Title de&s;cribes it, A compendious Tract of Morality, the &s;cope of which is, to teach the noble&s;t of all arts, that of becoming a good man, or a virtuous woman.</P>
<P>Finally, It is not &s;o entirely confined to the in&s;truction of young per&s;ons, as to become unprofitable to tho&s;e more
<PB N="vi" REF="030594_0005_0FE7F4405E78B478">advanced in years; e&s;pecially to fathers and mothers, who can never be &s;uffici|ently convinced of the great obligations they have contracted, as to the educa|tion of their children.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire of being u&s;eful to the public, is the motive which &s;timulates me, in pre&s;enting them the&s;e pages. My wi&s;hes will be accompli&s;hed, if I can obtain this end.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>TREATISE</HI> ON MORALITY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is the chief advantage which children may receive from their parents?</P>
<P>A good education.</P>
<P>Is not education the ba&s;is on which de|pends the fate of their whole life?</P>
<P>It is &s;o &s;aid, and with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Is not the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of human life entirely owing to education? that is to &s;ay, to the principles we receive in youth?</P>
<P>It ab&s;olutely is.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030594_0007_0FE7F448B11E7680">
Does not the &s;trength and &s;olidity of a building totally re&s;t on the firmne&s;s of the foundation which &s;u&s;tains it?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t undoubtedly.</P>
<P>Can an edifice, built on a weak founda|tion, long exi&s;t? Is it not threatened with approaching ruin?</P>
<P>Such an edifice cannot long exi&s;t; it mu&s;t certainly fall in a little time.</P>
<P>Is it not the &s;ame with re&s;pect to educa|tion? If it is vicious, if it does not tend to impre&s;s our minds with good, generous, and virtuous &s;entiments, can we ever hope to become prudent, di&s;creet, re&s;pectable, and capable of fulfilling with dignity the duties of that &s;tation in life which Provi|dence has allotted us?</P>
<P>Without a good education a child can &s;carcely afterwards acquire the qualities which render man good and virtuous.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030594_0008_0FE7F44F480567E0">
An ancient has ob&s;erved, that youth is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the different &s;tages of life: Is the ob&s;ervation ju&s;t? and, In what &s;en&s;e &s;hould we comprehend it?</P>
<P>The remark is ju&s;t; becau&s;e that age commonly decides the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of future life.</P>
<P>Do we not frequently compare a child to a young plant?</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;we are accu&s;tomed to make that compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Is not a young plant, newly received into the bo&s;om of the earth, &s;u&s;ceptible of every form we wi&s;h to give it?</P>
<P>That it is, without the lea&s;t difficulty.</P>
<P>If it is not &s;traight; if it is bent and crooked, or inclined downward; can we not ea&s;ily make it erect, in the fir&s;t &s;tages of its growth, and remove all its imperfections?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030594_0009_0FE7F450DDBF47B8">
This is done with facility, and continually practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>If we wait till it has grown up, and ga|thered &s;trength with its growth, will it then be as pliant, as manageable, and as fit to receive a new form?</P>
<P>By no means&mdash;we &s;hould then have more difficulty in making it receive new impre&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Will not the ta&s;k become more difficult in proportion as it is delayed, and as the plant increa&s;es and grows larger?</P>
<P>That mu&s;t naturally be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Should we wait till it becomes a great tree, would it then be po&s;&s;ible to change its &s;tubborn inclination? Would it not, on the contrary, always pre&s;erve it, whatever pains we may take, or de&s;ires we may have, to &s;ubdue it into new habits?</P>
<P>It is certain the plant we treat of will ever remain in this defective &s;tate, from
<PB N="11" REF="030594_0010_0FE7F4575EACC0B0">which no human exertions will be capable of altering it.</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e different conditions of the plant give us a lively idea of the different &s;tages of human life, namely, infancy, youth, and mature years?</P>
<P>Perfectly well&mdash;and it is ea&s;y to make the application.</P>
<P>Do not the defective forms ob&s;erved in &s;ome plants repre&s;ent to us the defects per|ceived in &s;ome children?</P>
<P>The compari&s;on is &s;imple and natural.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame mode of rea&s;oning, as we may ea&s;ily remedy the defects in tender plants in the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of their growth, is it not likely that we may, with the &s;ame fa|cility, remedy the imperfections of youth, when rea&s;on begins to dawn on the infant &s;oul?</P>
<P>To me it &s;eems &s;o&mdash;and I believe that ear|ly youth is the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on to amend the defects which then begin to appear.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030594_0011_0FE7F458F5ACC0D0">
Do you not imagine, that if, at &s;uch a period, young people are neglected, their imperfections will increa&s;e, &s;trengthen, and take a new and wayward turn, like the plant in its &s;econd &s;tate; and that after|wards it will be infinitely more difficult to reform them, &s;hould &s;uch an arduous ta&s;k be undertaken?</P>
<P>It is true, no doubt, and daily experience confirms it.</P>
<P>What would you think if tho&s;e very young people con&s;tantly practi&s;ed the errors of youth, and per&s;evered in them to an ad|vanced age?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t think they would certainly be|come habitual; and habit to man is a kind of &s;econd nature.</P>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e that a tree can produce good fruit, if neglected and left to it&s;elf?</P>
<P>In order that a tree &s;hould yield good fruit, it is very nece&s;&s;ary to attend to it, e&s;pecially when it is young.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030594_0012_0FE7F45FC580DFE0">
Do we ever &s;ee good &s;eed &s;own in the ground till it is fir&s;t ploughed and tilled?</P>
<P>No&mdash;the earth mu&s;t be tilled if the wi&s;h to reap the harve&s;t in the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>What does the be&s;t &s;oil produce, when it is not prepared by the labour of man?</P>
<P>Soil thus neglected, yields nothing but brambles, thorns, and noxious herbs.</P>
<P>What does the brighte&s;t genius produce when it is not cultivated with diligence, and enriched by the advantages of a good edu|cation?</P>
<P>The brighte&s;t genius without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a good education, can hardly ever yield any good, noble, great, or generous &s;entiment.</P>
<P>To what &s;hould a young per&s;on apply, who has received the benefit of a good edu|cation?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030594_0013_0FE7F4615FC12298">
To the &s;tudy of virtue, &s;cience, and good manners.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e two advantages, virtue or &s;cience, merits the preference?</P>
<P>Virtue is preferable to all things.</P>
<P>Is not the man to whom virtue is al|lotted, to be e&s;teemed at all times, and in the eyes of the whole world?</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;virtue alone is &s;ufficient to render a man each moment valuable, and in every age.</P>
<P>Does not &s;cience, unaccompanied by vir|tue, de&s;erve our e&s;teem?</P>
<P>Not at all&mdash;&s;cience has no intrin&s;ic worth, but when combined with merit and virtue.</P>
<P>Are there not &s;ome literary characters, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much erudition, who are at the &s;ame time, dangerous, obnoxious, and con|temptible?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030594_0014_0FE7F4682561A808">
We di&s;cover &s;ome of that tribe in every country, age, and government.</P>
<P>Does the good and virtuous man &s;ome|times &s;eek to do harm?</P>
<P>No&mdash;he endeavours only to do good; and the in&s;tant he begins to do hurt, he cea&s;es to be good.</P>
<P>Have we always the &s;ame ideas of good|ne&s;s and virtue?</P>
<P>We have.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e ideas common to all nations of the globe?</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas are generally diffu&s;ed, and are common to the inhabitants of Europe, as well as to tho&s;e of A&s;ia, Africa, and America.</P>
<P>Upon what are the&s;e notions of good and virtue founded?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030594_0015_0FE7F469C0FDE030">
Upon the eternal and unchangeable prin|ciples which God has engraven on the heart of man.</P>
<P>By what means are we to become good in mature years, and during the whole cour&s;e of life?</P>
<P>By beginning in time, or in early youth.</P>
<P>Can we learn the principles and art of virtue, as we do the other arts, for in|&s;tance, that of medicine?</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;there is a method and art of teach|ing the rules of virtue, as well as of ac|quiring the other &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Was this art known to the ancients, and practi&s;ed by them?</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory informs us, that the ancients well knew and practi&s;ed this art.</P>
<P>Could you quote &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from hi&s;|tory on this &s;ubject, to &s;hew us by exam|ple,
<PB N="17" REF="030594_0016_0FE7F4706317EEB8">how they formerly in&s;tructed the youth of Per&s;ia, Lacedemonia, Athens, and Rome?&mdash;begin with Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Formerly in Per&s;ia, the education of youth was con&s;idered the mo&s;t important duty, and e&s;&s;ential province of government: it did not depend on the attention of pa|rents, whom a blind and partial tenderne&s;s often rendered incapable of this care: the &s;tate was entru&s;ted with it: the youth were educated in common, after an uniform man|ner by which all were regulated: the &s;cene and continuance of their recreations; the time of their meals; the quality of their meat and drink; the number of their ma&s;|ters; the different modes of cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>In Per&s;ia the youth went to &s;chool to learn ju&s;tice, as el&s;ewhere they go there to acquire literature and the &s;ciences. The crime they puni&s;hed mo&s;t, was that of ingratitude.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome in a cla&s;s from child|hood till they were &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years old, at which period they entered the
<PB N="18" REF="030594_0017_0FE7F471F7291FD0">cla&s;s of young men; and then the &s;tricte&s;t authority was exerci&s;ed over them, be|cau&s;e that age, above any other, has need of the guardian eye of vigilance to watch over it. They remained ten years in this cla&s;s, under the direction of four different ma&s;ters, di&s;tingui&s;hed for their &s;cience, but much more for their merit. It was the pro|vince of each of the&s;e to in&s;truct them in a particular virtue: one taught religion; an|other ju&s;tice; the third pointed out the un|ruffled &s;erenity proceeding from temper|ance; and the fourth in&s;tilled the principles of courage.</P>
<P>The third cla&s;s was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e arrived at the &s;tate of manhood. Places and preferments were granted in the &s;tate to tho&s;e only who had pa&s;&s;ed through the different cla&s;&s;es, and given proofs of their application, merit, and abilities.</P>
<P>Fal&s;ehood was &s;everely puni&s;hed, and any one inclined to this vice was con&s;idered as infamous.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030594_0018_0FE7F4786C45EC60">
The object of the Per&s;ians in their whole|&s;ome laws re&s;pecting education was, to pre|vent evil, per&s;uaded that it was better to do &s;o than to puni&s;h it: And whil&s;t in other &s;tates, puni&s;hments were decreed to be in|flicted on criminals, they endeavoured to act in &s;uch a manner, as that among them, there &s;hould be no guilty per&s;ons.</P>
<P>What was the authority of parents over their children?</P>
<P>It was very great&mdash;they had the power of life and death over them.</P>
<P>How did they educate their children at Lacedemon?</P>
<P>Much the &s;ame way as at Per&s;ia: they did not commit to parents the education of their children; the &s;tate took charge of them, and cau&s;ed them all to be brought up in the &s;ame manner. The great princi|ple of the legi&s;lature of Lacedemon was, that as children belonged to the common|wealth,
<PB N="20" REF="030594_0019_0FE7F47A0AD7F870">they &s;hould be educated by the commonwealth, and for the public weal.</P>
<P>The grand &s;cience which they taught them, above all other things, was, an en|tire and implicit obedience to the laws, to magi&s;trates, to their parents, and in gene|ral, to all tho&s;e who were older than them|&s;elves. In fact, their obedience was not confined to their own parents alone, but all others had equally a right of commanding them; &s;o that if any parent had detected a child in error, he was obliged to reprove, correct, and cha&s;ti&s;e him: if the child hap|pened to complain to his own parent, it would have been con&s;idered &s;hameful in him, did he not inflict the &s;ame puni&s;hment which was already felt from the hands of the &s;tranger, who was the &s;ubject of com|plaint.</P>
<P>They inured them early to hard&s;hip, to enable them to &s;upport all &s;orts of fatigue and labour: from the age of &s;even years, they were &s;et to work in order to invigo|rate
<PB N="21" REF="030594_0020_0FE7F480C03F5EA8">their bodies: they were accu&s;tomed to different exerci&s;es &s;uitable to their years and growth: they always had &s;ome elderly per|&s;on among them, who pre&s;ided at their ex|erci&s;es; and in his ab&s;ence the mo&s;t prudent youth was made guardian over the re&s;t, who were &s;ubject to him.</P>
<P>They were obliged to &s;leep on hard beds, compo&s;ed of a kind of reeds, which they collected with their own hands, without the help of any implement: their apparel was always of the &s;ame &s;tuff, and they had not the liberty of changing it according to the &s;ea&s;ons: they were not &s;uffered to u&s;e nightly lamps to light them through the &s;treets.</P>
<P>They were admitted to public fea&s;ts, which, it is known, took place in this re|public. Thither they daily went to dine with their fathers. When they entered the hall, the elde&s;t pointing to the door de|livered to them the&s;e words, "Let no|thing that is mentioned here be conveyed hence through that gateway." This was
<PB N="22" REF="030594_0021_0FE7F48259301EC0">done in order to accu&s;tom them to keep &s;ecrets. Tho&s;e fea&s;ts were to them an excellent &s;chool of in&s;truction, for &s;obriety, temper|ance, wi&s;dom, and mode&s;ty. Here they heard &s;erious di&s;cour&s;es on politics, govern|ment, and morals; eulogiums on good and virtuous actions; and &s;evere &s;trictures on tho&s;e which were unworthy. Hence they became acquainted with the characters of great men, and tho&s;e virtues which had endeared them to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>In order to form the heart and judgment, &s;everal que&s;tions were propo&s;ed to them, &s;uch as follow: Who was the mo&s;t hone&s;t man in the republic? Which were the ne|ce&s;&s;ary virtues to form a good magi&s;trate, a good general, &amp;c.? they had to reply im|mediately to the&s;e interrogatories; and he who failed to do &s;o was in&s;tantly puni&s;hed. Their an&s;wers were conci&s;e and pertinent; for they were accu&s;tomed to &s;ay little, but to convey much in few words, becau&s;e their language was lively, &s;hort, and comprehen|&s;ive; and on this account the Lacedemonian language is termed <HI>laconic;</HI> &s;o that we &s;till
<PB N="23" REF="030594_0022_0FE7F48913EBABA0">&s;ay, when we &s;peak of a per&s;on who ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with brevity, that his &s;tyle is <HI>laconic.</HI></P>
<P>Could you quote &s;ome examples of this brevity of &s;tyle?</P>
<P>Among others the two following are re|lated: Philip, king of Macedon, being at war with the Lacedemonians, informed them by letter, that if he entered their ter|ritories with his army, he would lay all wa&s;te before him. They an&s;wered him by this &s;ingle mono&s;yllable, <HI>if.</HI>&mdash;The &s;ame mo|narch having addre&s;&s;ed them in a long let|ter, in which he required to know of them, whether he &s;hould enter Laconia as a friend or enemy? They replied, <HI>neither.</HI></P>
<P>Could you introduce here any in&s;tances of the courage and patience of the Lacede|monian children, in &s;upporting their ills?</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory offers us the two following: A Lacedemonian child being employed in a religious ceremony, it happened that a
<PB N="24" REF="030594_0023_0FE7F48AAC907280">burning coal fell on his &s;leeve which took fire and burned his hand: he endured the pain without &s;hedding a tear, or making any attempt to extingui&s;h the fire; and all this not to interrupt the order of the &s;a|crifice.</P>
<P>They report that another child, having &s;tolen a fox, concealed it in&s;ide his &s;hirt: the ferocious animal tore out his bowels, without the child's complaining, who dread|ed his theft might be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>In what manner did the philo&s;ophers, particularly Socrates, in&s;truct and form the youth at Athens?</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of the ancient philo&s;ophers at Athens was to a&s;&s;emble, at &s;tated times, and collect their di&s;ciples; to di&s;cour&s;e fa|miliarly in their pre&s;ence on the different branches of philo&s;ophy; to examine them often on the mo&s;t important points in mo|rals, politics, and government, and minute|ly expound the&s;e different &s;ubjects. Thus Socrates, Plato, Ari&s;totle, and many others,
<PB N="25" REF="030594_0024_0FE7F4916ED92230">educated their followers. Plato held his &s;chool in a garden at Athens, called aca|demy; from thence we derive the &s;ame name which we u&s;e in the pre&s;ent day to denote the different &s;ocieties of learned men.</P>
<P>When any of their &s;cholars had a lively de&s;ire to pur&s;ue the &s;ciences and an ar|dent ambition to become a philo&s;opher, he cho&s;e one who was mo&s;t eminent in that part of literature which he was &s;o emulous to acquire; he became attached to him in a particular manner; he con&s;tantly followed him for whole years, and applied him&s;elf the entire time to learn his le&s;&s;ons, to &s;tudy his principles, and to form his conduct after his example.</P>
<P>In &s;uch manner was Archelaus the di&s;ci|ple of Anaxagoras; Socrates of Archelaus; Xenophon and Plato of Socrates; Xende|rates and Ari&s;totle of Plato; be&s;ides many others. There were &s;ome even who un|dertook long voyages, in order to find out &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed literary character, under whom they &s;tudied many years. Among tho&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="030594_0025_0FE7F4930B86A348">different philo&s;ophers, there is one who me|rits our particular attention, and who&s;e name is highly worthy to be made known to you here; I mean Socrates, who may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered one of the greate&s;t &s;ages among the heathens. This great man de|voted his chief labours, and almo&s;t his whole life, to the in&s;truction of youth. We can|not expre&s;s what important &s;ervices he ren|dered the &s;tate by his in&s;truction, and the great number of pupils he had formed. Never had ma&s;ter &s;o many, nor any more illu&s;trious. It &s;eems, &s;ays Libanius, that he was the common father of the republic, he was &s;o watchful over the welfare and intere&s;ts of all.</P>
<P>Before his time, the philo&s;ophers &s;tudied natural objects; they had warm di&s;putes about matters which they could not fa|thom; on the manner in which the world has been formed; on the cau&s;e of pheno|mena which happen in the heavens and on the earth. Socrates deemed &s;uch re&s;earches of no utility, and con&s;idered tho&s;e who in|troduced them deficient in true wi&s;dom and
<PB N="27" REF="030594_0026_0FE7F49995820EC8">&s;olid under&s;tanding. What gave him a great di&s;gu&s;t to the different &s;ects who lived in his time was, particularly the infinite diver|&s;ity and incon&s;i&s;tency of the opinions which they taught. For, &s;aid he, even among&s;t madmen, we find &s;ome who are not intimi|dated at the appearance of things which are really terrifying, and others who are &s;cared at the &s;ight of the mo&s;t common and well-known objects: even among the phi|lo&s;ophers of our days, there are &s;ome who blu&s;h not publicly to indulge their di&s;ciples in principles the mo&s;t repugnant to the common ideas of rea&s;on and decorum; while others, who fall into oppo&s;ite errors, &s;carce|ly &s;uffer them to leave their dwellings, or to do the mo&s;t &s;imple and innocent ac|tions: we ob&s;erve &s;ome who ridicule tem|ples, altars, and the Divinity him&s;elf; others who give into the mo&s;t extravagant &s;uper|&s;tition, and go &s;o far as to adore &s;tatues of, wood, and even tho&s;e of brutes.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e &s;ects who &s;tudy the nature of the univer&s;e; one party a&s;&s;erts that there is but one world; another pretends that
<PB N="28" REF="030594_0027_0FE7F49B2AE093E8">there are an infinity. Tho&s;e would main|tain that all the parts of the world are in perpetual motion; the&s;e that it remains in a &s;tate of perfect and unchangeable repo&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From his ob&s;ervations on &s;uch contradic|tions and incon&s;i&s;tencies in the &s;chools, he was e&s;tranged from them, and &s;ought a more certain and u&s;eful method. He pur|&s;ued a track of philo&s;ophy comprehending more generally received and e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, of &s;ome advantage to his &s;cho|lars, and infinitely more valuable, &s;olid, and permanent; a moral and practical philo&s;o|phy, which tends to make man better.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t, &s;ays Cicero, who made wi&s;dom de&s;cend from above, to dwell in the habitations and in the mid&s;t of families. He kept no open &s;chool, like the other philo&s;ophers, not &s;et hours for his le&s;&s;ons. He was a philo&s;opher of all &s;ea&s;ons and all hours: he taught in every place, and on every occa&s;ion: on his walks, in conver&s;a|tion, at meals, in the army, the mid&s;t of the camp, in public a&s;&s;emblies of the peo|ple
<PB N="29" REF="030594_0028_0FE7F4A25C7E9610">or the &s;enate, even in the pri&s;on, and when taking a draught of hemlock, he phi|lo&s;ophized, &s;ays Plutarch, and in&s;tructed mankind.</P>
<P>At Athens, his cu&s;tom was, to go every day into the &s;treets, &s;quares, and a&s;&s;emblies; he there familiarly and &s;imply treated on &s;ub|jects relating to government and the con|duct of life: he &s;poke of piety, impiety; hone&s;ty, di&s;hone&s;ty; ju&s;tice, inju&s;tice; wi&s;|dom and folly; courage and cowardice; on government, the republic, politics, magi&s;|tracy, and all things of which the know|ledge is nece&s;&s;ary to man.</P>
<P>His method of teaching was to make many interrogatories; hence it was remark|ed, that he was him&s;elf ignorant of things he profe&s;&s;ed to teach others, and that he thereby &s;ought to improve him&s;elf. There was, however, &s;uch exqui&s;ite art in his que&s;|tions, and he propo&s;ed them in &s;uch a man|ner, as to render the truths &s;o clear and preci&s;e, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for his hearers not to con&s;ent to them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030594_0029_0FE7F4A3F7D18918">
He accompanied his in&s;tructions with a great number of compari&s;ons, which were very plain, and drawn from the mo&s;t com|mon and &s;imple &s;ubjects. He knew ex|tremely well how to adapt him&s;elf to the capacity and wants of his hearers, pointing out to each the duties of his &s;tation and years: he began, by impre&s;&s;ing on their minds the principles of religion; above all things recommending to them, never to un|dertake any thing without con&s;ulting the will of the gods, and endeavouring to ren|der them propitious, by offering up the &s;a|crifices u&s;ed in his time. From thence he entered into a detail of the obligations of civil life, admoni&s;hing the men to be good hu&s;bands; the women to be di&s;creet, mo|de&s;t, wi&s;e, and virtuous; both to be good fathers and mothers; to give their children a turn for labour; to teach them the prac|tice of virtue, and in&s;pire them with a love of their country: directing the children al&s;o to be re&s;pectful to their parents, docile and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their &s;uperiors. He &s;trenu|ou&s;ly recommended to all his fellow-citi|zens a zealous attachment to the common|wealth,
<PB N="31" REF="030594_0030_0FE7F4AA822A3EB8">an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the orders of magi&s;tracy, and the laws of the &s;tate. He expatiated much on the&s;e different &s;ub|jects, pointing every &s;entiment to the feel|ings of the heart, more forcibly than to the under&s;tanding; di&s;playing truth with that &s;imple, natural eloquence, at the &s;ame time animated and pathetic, which renders vir|tue truly amiable, and could not fail to pro|duce the mo&s;t happy impre&s;&s;ions on his hearers. It is not then a&s;toni&s;hing, that he &s;o happily &s;ucceeded in luring from the paths of vice &s;uch a va&s;t number of youth.</P>
<P>Socrates never in&s;tructed his pupils in the precepts of eloquence, till he had fir&s;t given them a ta&s;te of the moral and politi|cal virtues: he &s;aw plainly that virtue &s;hould be the foundation of eloquence; and that we &s;hould be good and virtuous be|fore we are eloquent. As to eloquence, his opinion was, that whoever conceives a thing ju&s;tly, can ea&s;ily explain it, and give an account of it to others. On the&s;e prin|ciples he was a&s;&s;iduous in giving his &s;cho|lars clear, ju&s;t, and di&s;tinct notions of
<PB N="32" REF="030594_0031_0FE7F4AC197D1DB0">things; which he did by explaining them in the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial manner. The better to accompli&s;h his views, he made u&s;e of dialogue, and propo&s;ed que&s;tions, which threw light on the &s;ubject, and rendered it obvious to every capacity. If he entered on any di&s;cour&s;e, he began by laying down &s;ure and evident principles, deeming it the be&s;t mode of convincing. Likewi&s;e, &s;ays Xenophon, he was of all I ever knew, the man, who, without contradiction, had the happie&s;t knack at per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>The following examples, which Xeno|phon has offered us, may give us an idea of the manner in which Socrates taught the virtues he &s;o diligently recommended to his di&s;ciples; and abhorred the vices, for which he implanted in their minds the utmo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked them, Whether liberty was not one of the mo&s;t invaluable ble&s;&s;ings which man could enjoy? Yes, undoubtedly, replied they. Do you think him free who &s;uffers him&s;elf to be hurried away by &s;en|&s;ual
<PB N="33" REF="030594_0032_0FE7F4B2D737C190">gratifications, inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, and their de&s;potic &s;way, that iron bar to the practice of virtue? No&mdash;he cannot be free. What opinion have you of tho&s;e ma&s;ters who divert us from good, and lead us into evil? They are, in our judgment, the mo&s;t wicked of all mankind. Do not all the world agree, that the pa&s;&s;ions, and e&s;peci|ally that of intemperance, hinder man from the exerci&s;e of virtue, and urge him to evil? It is an unque&s;tionable truth. What would you think of a prince, who would deprive his &s;ubjects of their property, the &s;tate of its citizens, &s;ociety of its members, and fa|milies of their &s;upport? of a prince, who, having no law but his tyrannical will, would condemn to mi&s;ery, to torture, to di&s;ea&s;e, to violent and &s;udden death, tho&s;e who would acknowledge his authority? of a prince, in &s;hort, who&s;e laws would be much more injurious to his &s;ubjects, than &s;alutary or advantageous? What idea mu&s;t you en|tertain of &s;uch a prince? He would truly appear, in our eyes, the mo&s;t cruel of all tyrants. This barbarous tyrant, returns Socrates, is intemperance, who &s;uddenly
<PB N="34" REF="030594_0033_0FE7F4B46F7A01C8">whelms, in every calamity, tho&s;e who &s;ub|mit to his laws. He &s;trips them of their rights, in order to en&s;lave them to cu&s;toms which religion, honour, and rea&s;on unani|mou&s;ly reject. He deprives the &s;tate of ci|tizens, by rendering them incapable of be|coming u&s;eful to it; &s;ociety of its members, to which they are a plague, by the conta|gion of their bad examples; and families of their hopes, to which they prove, by the ba&s;ene&s;s of their conduct, a &s;candal and in|famy. This frantic tyrant plunges his vic|tims into a &s;ea of troubles. He never cea&s;es to level his empoi&s;oned arrows in or|der to wound them in every part; in their per&s;on, property, mind, con&s;cience, honour, and reputation. This vice is the &s;ource of &s;ufferings and di&s;ea&s;es; the cau&s;e of &s;hame|ful and untimely deaths; the ruin of fami|lies, children, and friends.</P>
<P>What we &s;ay here of intemperance, we can equally &s;ay of the other vices and inor|dinate pa&s;&s;ions, of anger, pride, gluttony, avarice, and ambition. The&s;e cruel ma&s;ters command, with &s;uch authority, the &s;laves,
<PB N="35" REF="030594_0034_0FE7F4BB065E9998">which are once &s;ubject to them, that du|ring the labours of their youth and age, they compel them to devote their whole time to their &s;ervice; to yield them the en|tire produce of tho&s;e labours; to undergo many hard&s;hips and difficulties; and at la&s;t, even to &s;ink into poverty and wretchedne&s;s, for the gratification of their de&s;ires. But at length, when they are worn out in the &s;ervice, and incapable of being any longer u&s;eful to them, their ma&s;ters for&s;ake them, &s;uffering them to langui&s;h in old age, and drag on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, in de&s;pair and unavailing pen&s;ive reflections on the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>He thus makes them perceive that they are blindfolded by this vice, and prevented from di&s;tingui&s;hing what is good and profit|able; that the heart is vitiated by it, and drawn from the love of virtue; that it pol|lutes all the powers of the &s;oul, and gives it an evil tendency in all things. To this pa&s;&s;ion he contra&s;ts the virtue of temper|ance, which he paints in beautiful colours: he proves to them that it procures infinite advantages; that it is the &s;ource of true
<PB N="36" REF="030594_0035_0FE7E92091770220">plea&s;ure, and the parent of real happine&s;s; that it alone gives liberty to the &s;oul, and lei&s;ure to indulge in the practice of good morals; that it always pre&s;erves the body in health and the mind in tranquillity; that it makes union and pro&s;perity reign in fa|milies; that it procures the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of all worthy people; that it places man in a condition of becoming u&s;e|ful to his friends and his country; and that, in &s;hort, it renders youth healthful and vi|gorous, and old age plea&s;ant and re&s;pecta|ble. He concludes, that we &s;hould then be attached to this virtue, love and prac|ti&s;e it, and, on the contrary, that we ought to combat the oppo&s;ite vice with the &s;ame zeal and courage with which we attack an unju&s;t enemy, who attempts to rob us of liberty.</P>
<P>Is it not true, ob&s;erved he at times, that in order to &s;ucceed and improve in any &s;cience whatever, we mu&s;t &s;tudy a long time its principles and rules; learn from the be&s;t ma&s;ters, and be formed in their &s;chools? Could we be &s;o weak as to be|lieve
<PB N="37" REF="030594_0036_0FE7F4BC9F28DE20">that we mu&s;t not follow the &s;ame plan in acquiring the mo&s;t u&s;eful, great, and no|ble of all profe&s;&s;ions, that of knowing how to live well? Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing to remark, that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to become phy&s;icians, or to learn any other &s;cience, apply to the be&s;t ma&s;ters re&s;pectively, and that the ge|nerality of mankind neglect to have re|cour&s;e to tho&s;e ma&s;ters which they have mo&s;t occa&s;ion for; &s;uch as could teach them the rules of life, the principles of good mo|rals, the knowledge of their duties, the &s;cience of virtues, and the good qualities of the &s;oul, which alone con&s;titute the dignity and happine&s;s of man?</P>
<P>It is not, &s;till continued he, gold nor &s;ilver, which makes &s;ome men better or greater than others; it is the precepts of philo&s;o|phy, the le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom, that enrich the mind, and put it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trea&s;ures of virtue, which are far prefera|ble to the wealth of worlds.</P>
<P>Socrates took particular care to give his &s;cholars a high idea of the power and good|ne&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="030594_0037_0FE7F4C337611020">of the gods: you may judge of it by the admirable conver&s;ation which he held with Euthydeme, on Providence. Xeno|phon has pre&s;erved it for us, and Mr. Rol|lin relates it in his Ancient Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Have you never reflected, &s;ays Socrates to Euthydeme, how the gods have taken care to give mankind all that is nece&s;&s;ary? Never, I a&s;&s;ure you, replies he. Do you &s;ee, returns Socrates, how u&s;eful light is to us, and how precious that gift be&s;towed us by the gods? Indeed, replies Euthy|deme, we &s;hould be like blind men without it, and all nature would be lifele&s;s. But becau&s;e we have need of re&s;t, they have given us night for repo&s;e. They have de|creed that the &s;un, that brilliant and lumi|nous planet, &s;hould pre&s;ide by day, to di&s;|tingui&s;h the different parts thereof; and that it &s;erve, not only to unfold the won|ders of nature, but to bear life and heat throughout the univer&s;e. They have al&s;o ordained, that the &s;tars and the moon illu|minate the night, which is in it&s;elf ob&s;cure and gloomy. Can there be any thing &s;o
<PB N="39" REF="030594_0038_0FE7F4C4D4F53C00">admirable as this variety, this alternate change of night and day, of light and dark|ne&s;s, of labour and re&s;t; and all de&s;igned for the good of man?</P>
<P>Socrates, in like manner, related the infi|nite advantages we receive from fire and wa|ter, in &s;upplying the wants of life. Continuing his ob&s;ervations on the wonderful attention of Providence to all that regards us, What &s;ay you, enquired he, on perceiving that after winter the &s;un returns to us; and that as the fruits of one &s;ea&s;on decay, he ripens tho&s;e that &s;ucceed? that having rendered this &s;ervice to man, he retires, as it would &s;eem, from an apprehen&s;ion of incommo|ding us with his heat? Afterwards, when he withdraws to a certain boundary, which he cannot exceed without putting us in danger of peri&s;hing with cold, he returns back again, to take up his quarters in that region of the heavens where his pre&s;ence proves mo&s;t beneficial to us; and as we cannot &s;uffer exce&s;&s;ive cold on heat, &s;hould the tran&s;ition be &s;udden from one to the other, is it not worthy of admiration, that
<PB N="40" REF="030594_0039_0FE7F4CB72450C90">this luminary approaches and retires from us &s;o &s;lowly that we arrive at either extreme, in a manner almo&s;t imperceptible? Would it be po&s;&s;ible not to acknowledge, in this regularity of the annual &s;ea&s;ons, an over|ruling Providence, not only attentive to our wants, but even to our comforts?</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;ays Euthydeme, make me doubt whether the gods have heaped &s;uch benefits on man only? One point alone &s;taggers my credulity, which is, that inferior animals participate in all the good things of this life as well as we. Yes, replies Socrates, but do you not &s;ee that the&s;e animals &s;olely exi&s;t for the u&s;e of man? He &s;ubdues the mo&s;t powerful and unwieldy of them, tames them, and employs them, with the utmo&s;t advantage, for war, labour, and other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t we think, if we &s;urvey man on the &s;cale of being? Here Socrates ex|amined the different &s;en&s;es, by the exerci&s;e of which man enjoys all that is noble and excellent in nature; the vivacity of his wit,
<PB N="41" REF="030594_0040_0FE7F4CD0E46E458">and the &s;trength of his rea&s;on, which rai&s;e him infinitely above all other animals; the wonderful gift of &s;peech, by means of which, we mutually communicate our thoughts, publi&s;h our laws, and regulate the common|wealth.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, &s;ays So|crates, it is ea&s;y to infer the exi&s;tence of the gods, and that they &s;helter man under the wings of their protection, though he cannot di&s;cover them through the medium of his &s;en&s;es. Do we perceive the thun|der-bolt cru&s;h all before it? Do we di&s;tin|gui&s;h the winds which, before our eyes, make &s;uch dreadful ravages? Do we ever &s;ee our &s;oul, which is &s;o intimately blended with our exi&s;tence, which actuates and ani|mates us? Is it not the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the gods, none of whom become vi&s;ible in order to di&s;tribute their favours. Even the Great God [the&s;e words are remark|able], this Great God, I &s;ay, who has cre|ated the univer&s;e, and who &s;u&s;tains the great work, who&s;e parts are perfected in excellence and beauty; who decreed that
<PB N="42" REF="030594_0041_0FE7F4D3CCA2FC40">they &s;hould not grow old with time, but ever flouri&s;h in immortal youth; who al&s;o ordained, that they obey him with a cele|rity of motion which imagination cannot trace; this God is vi&s;ible enough in the wondrous works of the creation, of which he is the author; but always invi&s;ible as to his per&s;on. Let us not then with-hold our belief from what we do not &s;ee; but in&s;tead of our corporeal eyes, let us u&s;e tho&s;e of the &s;oul; and above all, let us en|deavour to render proper homage to the Divinity, who wi&s;hes to be known but by his beneficence. This homage, this wor|&s;hip, con&s;i&s;ts in plea&s;ing him; and we can|not plea&s;e him but by performing his will.</P>
<P>After this manner Socrates in&s;tructed youth; and &s;uch were the principles and &s;entiments with which he in&s;pired them.</P>
<P>He frequently repeated in his di&s;cour&s;es, that the gods watched all our words and actions; pierced the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the &s;oul; were pre&s;ent at our deliberations, and in&s;pired us in all our affairs. Dead or living,
<PB N="43" REF="030594_0042_0FE7F4D56E77A910">&s;aid he, the good man is never forgotten by the gods.</P>
<P>Socrates al&s;o taught his di&s;ciples the mode of pre&s;erving health. He held it as a maxim, that man &s;hould become acquaint|ed with his own con&s;titution, and with tho&s;e things which either agree or di&s;a|gree with it; that he &s;hould make u&s;e of the one and avoid the other, and become his own phy&s;ician. He particularly recom|mended &s;obriety to them, advi&s;ing them carefully to &s;hun tho&s;e luxurious di&s;hes and agreeable draughts, which only tend to provoke a fal&s;e appetite, un&s;olicited by the calls of nature, in the pre&s;&s;ing demands of hunger and thir&s;t; and added, that no|thing, &s;o much as exce&s;s in eating and drinking, contributes to di&s;order, all at once, the &s;tomach, the head, and the un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The ardour of the young Athenians, in following his philo&s;ophical principles, was incredible. They quitted father and mo|ther, and renounced all parties of plea&s;ure,
<PB N="44" REF="030594_0043_0FE7F4DD2D37A730">to adhere to him, and li&s;ten to his doctrine. We may judge of it by Alcibiades, one of the mo&s;t lively and impetuous young men of his time. The means, Socrates u&s;ed, to check his pride, merits a place here. This young man was boa&s;ting one day of the va&s;t riches and property he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, when So|crates laid a map before him, and a&s;ked him where Greece was &s;ituated? The &s;pace which this country occupied was too &s;mall to be readily di&s;cerned: he at length, how|ever, di&s;covered a glimp&s;e of it, and point|ed it out; but on being reque&s;ted to &s;hew his own territories therein, It is a matter of too little importance, &s;aid he, to be &s;et down in &s;o narrow a &s;pace. This, then, replied Socrates, an imperceptible point of the globe, is what turns your brain.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;ons which Socrates gave, made the greater impre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he him|&s;elf practi&s;ed the virtues which he incul|cated.</P>
<P>The limit of this production do not per|mit me to give his hi&s;tory; I beg leave to
<PB N="45" REF="030594_0044_0FE7F4DECC4A1288">refer tho&s;e who wi&s;h to become acquainted with it, to Rollin's Works, or Xenophon's Memoirs.</P>
<P>How were children educated at Rome?</P>
<P>In turning over the pages of Roman hi&s;|tory, we have had frequent opportunities of remarking the care taken at Rome in the education of youth; we have ob&s;erved it particularly in the per&s;on of Paulus Emi|lius. This illu&s;trious Roman, who had a perfect knowledge of the art of forming the mind, procured for his children the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters of the age he lived in. Notwith&s;tanding the important duties of his &s;tation, he often a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their different exerci&s;es, in order to encourage them by his pre&s;ence. You may recollect that his children &s;trove, by a noble emulation, to fulfil the de&s;ires and expectation of &s;o good a father, by their application to &s;tudy and their progre&s;s in the &s;ciences. Their ta&s;te for literature was &s;o great, that when he conquered the kingdom of Macedon, they would not deign to be&s;tow a glance on the
<PB N="46" REF="030594_0045_0FE7F4E57796A2F8">immen&s;e trea&s;ures of the king; they were only tempted by a view of the library in his palace, to reque&s;t it of Pauius Emilius, who granted their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>You have al&s;o &s;een how refined was the education of Scipio Africanus; how it ten|ded to form his mind and heart; what ad|vantages he derived from it in the execu|tion of tho&s;e great enterprizes which he af|terwards undertook; how much it contri|buted to render him famous in war and in peace; to in&s;pire him, not only with poli|tical and military virtues, but even with moral and private. The happy &s;entiments which he di&s;covered in the hi&s;torian Poly|bius, attached this great man to him in a particular manner, and powerfully &s;timula|ted him to acquire that high reputation which has rendered his name immortal.</P>
<P>In Rome, the province of education was not confined to the men only; the women took a part in it, as we may judge from the following pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="030594_0046_0FE7F4E7141EE4E8">
A Roman lady having gone to pay a vi|&s;it to one of her friends and neighbours, the toilet was the topic of their conver&s;a|tion. The &s;trange lady &s;aid a great deal on the &s;ubject, and entered into a minute detail of the various jewels &s;he had in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o of tho&s;e ornaments which &s;erved to embelli&s;h the &s;ex. Her friend let her go on, without interruption, until her children, who were at &s;chool, came home: when &s;he &s;aw them enter the door, &s;he re|&s;umed the conver&s;ation, and introducing them, &s;aid, I have not &s;hewn you my jewels, becau&s;e I had them not; here they are now, and I may &s;peak to you about them: The&s;e children you &s;ee are my dia|monds, and the ornaments mo&s;t dear to my heart: my delight and my glory con&s;i&s;t in poli&s;hing and adorning their minds, by a &s;olid and virtuous education: the joy I feel in ob&s;erving their progre&s;s in &s;cience and virtue, is to me preferable to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t rare and precious jewels.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t we infer from the premi&s;es, re&s;pecting the attention paid to the educa|tion
<PB N="48" REF="030594_0047_0FE7F4EDB7734060">of youth in the various ountrie have mentioned?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t conclude, that at all times, and in every poli&s;hed nation, the education of youth was e&s;teemed an e&s;&s;ential and indi&s;|pen&s;able duty; and that the ancients were always per&s;uaded that the pro&s;perity of &s;tates, the happine&s;s of families, and the public as well as private welfare entirely depended on it. They were ever of opi|nion, that what made a di&s;tinction between men, and rendered them truly worthy, did not re&s;ult from riches, honours, rank, and dignity, but from piety, merit, and virtue.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;entiments cannot be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed and impre&s;&s;ed on the hearts of youth, without the advantages of a culti|vated and virtuous education, pur&s;ued with unremitting application; of an education which makes us fill with honour the &s;tation to which we are called, the &s;phere of ac|tion we are de&s;tined by Providence to move in; of an education, in &s;hort, which brings us early acquainted with the duties we have
<PB N="49" REF="030594_0048_0FE7E91CC6ED8770">to practi&s;e, and which form the whole eco|nomy of human life; which induces us to love and cheri&s;h tho&s;e duties, by inculca|ting this truth, that we cannot be happy or de&s;erving in the &s;ight of God or man, unle&s;s we faithfully di&s;charge them.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me what tho&s;e duties are, and you de&s;ire that I &s;hould expound, at lea&s;t, the fundamental ones, which &s;erve as a ba&s;is to all the re&s;t. Nothing more lau|dable than &s;uch a de&s;ire, and I con&s;ider it my duty to gratify it. Reflection and the following particulars will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your pur&s;uit. The duties impo&s;ed on man, and which we have to fulfil at all times, in all ages, and in every condition of life, are of three kinds: the fir&s;t relate to God; the &s;e|cond to &s;ociety and private life; the third to our&s;elves, and are per&s;onal.</P>
<P>That we have to perform certain duties to God, is an indi&s;putable and generally receive truth.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030594_0049_0FE7F60D1420AA08">
In fact, if God has created heaven and earth; if he has formed the world out of nothing; if he has made man, and endued him with rea&s;on to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil; if he has moulded him after his own image, by animating him with a &s;oul capable of knowing, loving, &s;erving, and adoring him; if he de&s;tines him for immortality; he cannot then leave him to chance in this world: He mu&s;t therefore have manife&s;ted his will; pre&s;cribed duties; appointed a mode of wor&s;hip; and ordained a religion for man to regulate his actions; to put him in con&s;tant mind of the author of his exi&s;tence; and the end of his crea|tion; to give him a &s;en&s;e of his obligations to the Deity; and keep him in a &s;tate of per&s;evering &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and dependence on that Great Being.</P>
<P>This religion then is divine, &s;ince it has God for its author; it exi&s;ted at all times, &s;ince, by its nature, it can be traced back to the beginning of things: it is al&s;o as an|cient as the world: it is practi&s;ed in all
<PB N="51" REF="030594_0050_0FE7F4F66BAB1B90">countries, and for all men, &s;ince it is the work of the Sovereign Ma&s;ter of the whole world: it is the only true one, as God who founded it is the only true God: it is holy, as it flows from him who is holi|ne&s;s it&s;elf: it is nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able, &s;ince its end is to direct us on earth, and make us happy hereafter.</P>
<P>This truth, that religion is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able, has been acknow|ledged in all ages, and even by the hea|thens them&s;elves. You will find in the cour&s;e of human affairs, &s;ays Plutarch, &s;ome cities without walls, without &s;chools, without a king, without a theatre, and without any of the amu&s;ements u&s;ual in our republics; but you will not find any which do not acknowledge a God, call upon him as a witne&s;s, addre&s;s him in prayer and &s;a|crifices to obtain &s;ome ble&s;&s;ings, or avert &s;ome calamities: &s;uch cities man has never &s;een, nor ever will. It appears to me more po&s;&s;ible to build a town without a foundation and ground to &s;upport it, than to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="52" REF="030594_0051_0FE7F4F8082E5470">a government without religion; it is that which &s;u&s;tains, and makes human &s;ociety flouri&s;h; it is the ba&s;is and the very &s;inews of the laws.</P>
<P>This would be a proper place to treat the pre&s;ent &s;ubject more fully; to de&s;cribe to you the different religions; to make you di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e invented by man, and that which has God for its authors; to point out the novelty or recent date of the former, and the antiquity of the latter; and to explain to you, in an ample man|ner, the motives which &s;hould determine our choice, and induce us to embrace that only true religion in preference to all others: but as we have already a number of excellent authors on this &s;ubject, which you can procure, I mu&s;t refer you to their works, and reque&s;t of you to read them with an impartial judgment, and a &s;incere de&s;ire of coming at the truth. If it be the part of candour and rectitude of &s;oul to &s;eek it, and make it the rule of conduct, it &s;hould certainly be our province, in a more
<PB N="53" REF="030594_0052_0FE7F4FEAC066E78">exalted point of view, where our deare&s;t intere&s;t, tho&s;e of time and eternity, are concerned.</P>
<P>After the&s;e reflections on our duties to|wards God, we &s;hall next di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e we have to perform in &s;ociety towards mankind and our&s;elves.</P>
<P>After our duties towards God an reli|gion, what others have we to fulfil?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e naturally follow which we owe our parents: to know the nature and ex|tent of &s;uch duties, it is &s;ufficient to call to mind the obligations we are under to them. The following reflections will &s;erve to pre|&s;ent them to the mind.</P>
<P>We are fir&s;t indebted to them for our birth; &s;hould they have no other claim to our gratitude, the voice of nature cries aloud that we &s;hould te&s;tify it in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner during our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="030594_0053_0FE7F50048E45248">
But this favour, however great it may be con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is nothing, when compared to tho&s;e for which we are indebt|ed to them &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>Were we to trace back the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of life, and the time which has elap&s;ed &s;ince our birth, What were we then capable of, and what cares and anxieties have we not occa&s;ioned? Weakne&s;s and ignorance were our portion. De&s;titute of every thing except numerous wants, and unable of our|&s;elves to &s;upply them; deprived of the means of making our&s;elves under&s;tood; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no language but that of tears and cries; incapable of u&s;ing our limbs; apparently &s;uffering in our helple&s;s &s;itua|tion; and finding no repo&s;e but in the arms and on the bo&s;om of our mothers; what anxiety they then endured, what unea&s;ine&s;s, toil, and trouble they underwent?</P>
<P>Among the numerous nece&s;&s;ities in&s;epa|rable from our condition, how mu&s;t it be with tho&s;e children who &s;eem repugnant to
<PB N="55" REF="030594_0054_0FE7F506CC366378">nature, and the general aver&s;ion for whom can only be &s;ubdued by the love and ten|derne&s;s of fond mothers, who&s;e &s;ufferings on this occa&s;ion are the more poignant, as they are not limited to a &s;hort time, to a few weeks or months, but protracted for whole years; each hour, each moment of the day is not only devoted to mi&s;ery, but the night, that calm &s;ea&s;on of repo&s;e, is con&s;umed in weeping vigils over their fro|ward offspring, who&s;e cea&s;ele&s;s cries can &s;carcely be lulled to re&s;t even by the nou|ri&s;hment they &s;eem to demand.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay of the trouble and &s;o|licitude we have occa&s;ioned during the lin|gering hours of &s;ickne&s;s, to which infancy is &s;o frequently expo&s;ed? And really in proportion as our tender limbs expand, as we advance in growth, we appear in more danger of dropping out of exi&s;tence; for every effort which nature makes in unfold|ing our corporeal faculties, &s;eems as if &s;he would deprive us of the little life which feebly animates us. What unea&s;ine&s;s we give them, when our teeth (the &s;malle&s;t ap|pendages
<PB N="56" REF="030594_0055_0FE7F50865568090">of the body) begin to pierce through the gums, and collect con&s;i&s;tence: At this cri&s;is we are reduced to a &s;tate of rapid decline and weakne&s;s, which awaken every apprehen&s;ion for our &s;afety. While we were thus &s;u&s;pended between life and death, what could equal the &s;orrows of our parents, or what lively pencil could have even &s;ketched their feelings? Overwhelmed with grief, bereft of every con&s;olation, they had only power to wring their hands; to rai&s;e their dim eyes towards heaven; to im|plore the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and offer up the mo&s;t ardent and &s;incere petitions for our &s;afety.</P>
<P>After having miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped the numberle&s;s dangers which attend our in|fancy, we arrive at an age in which the fa|culties of mind and body demand new vigi|lance, and cares of a more elevated and no|ble nature; I mean tho&s;e which relate to the &s;oul, to the under&s;tanding, and which have for their main object our future edu|cation. What new and infinite obligations we contract at this period with our parents?
<PB N="57" REF="030594_0056_0FE7F50F1D518DE0">e&s;pecially if Providence has given us pa|rents truly worthy of this name: Parents, who, be&s;ides &s;upplying us with food, and be&s;towing that attention we &s;tood in need of in our helple&s;s years, con&s;ider the&s;e as no more than a &s;mall part of their duty, &s;hould they neglect to improve our minds with nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction in youth: Pa|rents, who, convinced of our real intere&s;t, embrace betimes the means of making us happy: Parents, who, per&s;uaded that all the wealth they may leave their children is, by no means, to be compared to virtue and a good education, have nothing &s;o much at heart as forming their principles: Parents who continually inculcate the&s;e im|portant truths, viz. that not all the advan|tages of fortune, per&s;on, or figure, an ren|der us truly happy and meritorious, with|out the virtues of the heart and good qualities of the mind: Parents, in fine, who, imitating the example of the Ro|man lady, whom we had occa&s;ion to men|tion, look upon their children as their ornament, their pride, and their glory: If, I &s;ay, Providence has given us &s;uch
<PB N="58" REF="030594_0057_0FE7F510B2A299C8">parents, then we &s;hould e&s;teem our&s;elves happy indeed, and return perpetual ble&s;&s;|ings for our highly favoured condition: it is then we &s;hould acknowledge the ex|tent and magnitude of the benefits for which we are indebted to them: it is then they e&s;tabli&s;h the ba&s;is and motives of a gratitude which our whole life is not capable of repaying them. This gra|titude, in fact, &s;hould ari&s;e from the &s;er|vices they render us: the more noble and generous the&s;e &s;ervices are, the greater and more exten&s;ive &s;hould be our acknowledg|ments. But as the &s;oul, the rea&s;on, and under&s;tanding are infinitely &s;uperior to the body, it follows, that our gratitude for be|nefits which relate to them, &s;hould be as much more eminent, as they are exalted above the body.</P>
<P>And truly our parents, in giving us life, in taking care of our infancy, in &s;upplying us with the nece&s;&s;ary food for the main|tenance and pre&s;ervation of exi&s;tence, have only acquitted them&s;elves of the duties which are common to all parents re&s;pecting
<PB N="59" REF="030594_0058_0FE7F51744D71708">their children; but by mini&s;tering to our rea&s;on and judgment the proper food of the mind; by pre&s;enting us with the means of in&s;truction; by laying within our hearts, foundations which only can &s;upport the edi|fice, and cement the happine&s;s of our lives, I mean the valuable advantages of a &s;olid and virtuous education, they gain an a&s;cendancy over our feelings, and claim a right to our acknowledgments, which, under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, we cannot with-hold; a right as ju&s;t and indi&s;putable, as the motives upon which it is founded are pure and unchangeable. The care they take to cul|tivate our under&s;tanding, and form our rea|&s;on, is a kind of &s;econd birth, for which we are infinitely more indebted than for the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident then, from every rea&s;on which we are about to explain, that we are under great obligations to our parents, and that we have certain duties towards them to fulfil. Before we enter into a detail of the&s;e duties, in order to give them more efficacy, it is expedient to treat on the power of parents over their children,
<PB N="60" REF="030594_0059_0FE7F518DE0F4060">and point out the foundation and extent of their authority, with re&s;pect to us. Let us begin by con&s;ulting the hi&s;toric page, and &s;ee if at all times, and in all governments, the &s;ame ideas have been conceived on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Lacedemonians, we have ob&s;erved, gave, according to their laws, the greate&s;t authority to parents, not only over their own children, but, in general, over all others what&s;oever; &s;o that, in this repub|lic, the children were under the juri&s;dic|tion of all fathers, who had the privilege of reproving, correcting, and cha&s;ti&s;ing them, without making any complaint to their real parents.</P>
<P>We read in Per&s;ian hi&s;tory, that fathers had the power of life and death over their children. At Rome, the law granted them the &s;ame right; and al&s;o that of &s;elling and di&s;po&s;ing of them as they judged proper.</P>
<P>If in our modern governments, the laws do not grant &s;uch an unlimited authority to
<PB N="61" REF="030594_0060_0FE7F51F52AACB18">parents, it is not therefore to be imagined that they aim at dimini&s;hing a tittle of that authority which is proper and e&s;&s;ential to them. They are granted &s;uch &s;ufficient powers and privileges as intitle them to in|&s;truct, to command, to reprove and correct us by every means which they may deem fit and nece&s;&s;ary. Such an authority ju&s;tly belongs to them: nothing can deprive them of it, or prevail on them to give it up: they hold it from God, who has entru&s;ted them with it, and ordained that they &s;hould exerci&s;e it over us. Hence it follows, that the duty of children towards their parents is, to love, honour, and obey them; to &s;hew them, on all occa&s;ions, every mark of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect; to repay their cares; to te&s;tify to them their gratitude; to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;uccour, and procure them every comfort and con&s;olation in their power.</P>
<P>The duty of re&s;pect towards parents is not only impo&s;ed on us by man, but God him&s;elf hands it down to us as an ab&s;olute command; &s;o that we cannot fail therein without offending, at the &s;ame time, again&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="030594_0061_0FE7F520E9DD1E08">both divine and human laws. If we open the Scriptures, we &s;hall there &s;ee that of all the precepts which God has laid down for man, there is none &s;o particularly re|commended to him as filial duty; nor is there any of &s;uch importance if attended to, nor of &s;uch fatal con&s;equences if neglect|ed. It is the only one to the ob&s;ervance of which even temporal happine&s;s is an|nexed: <HI>Honour your father and mother,</HI> de|clares he, <HI>that your days may be long in the land;</HI> &s;o that a long and happy life is pro|mi&s;ed us, as the fruit and reward of the honour and re&s;pect rendered our parents. The &s;ame principle generally prevails in the Holy Scripture: this duty, throughout that &s;acred volume, is enjoined us, and ab&s;o|lutely commanded: we every where ob|&s;erve there the mo&s;t copious ble&s;&s;ings pro|mi&s;ed to children who are dutiful, and the mo&s;t dreadful cur&s;es pronounced again&s;t tho&s;e who are di&s;obedient to their parents. Even in this life we often &s;ee the&s;e male|dictions fall on the guilty head, for we &s;el|dom ob&s;erve youth thrive or pro&s;per, who have given &s;orrow and affliction to their pa|rents
<PB N="63" REF="030594_0062_0FE7F52755318980">by a &s;pirit of ob&s;tinacy, want of &s;ub|ordination, and indocility. It is com|monly remarked, that this froward di&s;po&s;i|tion is a &s;ource of bitterne&s;s and misfortune which make them unhappy during their lives, unhappy in their marriages, unhap|py in their wives, unhappy in their hu&s;|bands, and particularly unhappy in their children, who pur&s;ue, with re&s;pect to them, the &s;ame line of conduct which they pur|&s;ued by former perver&s;ene&s;s and irreverence to their parents; and who al&s;o, like them, are untractable, di&s;obedient, undutiful, un|grateful, enemies to labour and application, and addicted to the company of libertines and &s;pendthrifts.</P>
<P>To be convinced of the truth of the &s;ubject we here treat on, let us reflect on the manner we may be di&s;po&s;ed, when we enter the habitation of a family.&mdash; What ideas do we naturally conceive on the occa&s;ion, and what objects occupy our attention? We fir&s;t ca&s;t a glance on the parents and children; examine their &s;itu|ation; &s;ee if order and duty are ob&s;erved
<PB N="64" REF="030594_0063_0FE7F5291260BE10">by them; if the father and mother are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that authority which be|longs to them; if they are re&s;pected, be|loved, and obeyed; if the children keep within the bounds pre&s;cribed them; if they keep their conduct equally remote from &s;er|vile fear, and that freedom which degene|rates into licentiou&s;ne&s;s; if they pre&s;erve a demeanour which at once declares both re|&s;pect and filial love; if, in the whole tenor of their behaviour they are influenced by duty, and dread nothing &s;o much as giving them the lea&s;t cau&s;e of umbrage or di&s;|plea&s;ure; if they e&s;tabli&s;h the empire of or|der, peace, harmony, and reciprocal love; if they &s;hew good example, excite an emu|lation to labour, and the &s;tudy of virtue; if they pur&s;ue the paths of decency, ho|ne&s;ty, and rectitude of manners, which are the effects of a good education; if all this is pre&s;ented to my view, the delightful &s;cene awakens my &s;en&s;ibility, flatters my fine&s;t feelings, and charms the pure&s;t &s;en|&s;ations of my &s;oul; I enjoy it with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, and dwell on it with ineffable delight.

<P>If, on the contrary, the rever&s;e of the above, unhappily meets my view; if the pa|rents are without authority; if the children have thrown off obedience, and di&s;regard the parental voice; if each wi&s;hes to be|come his own ma&s;ter, and follow the dic|tates of his own will and caprice; if peace, union, and friend&s;hip do not reign among them; if the voice of di&s;cord and anarchy is only heard in the hou&s;e; if they become inattentive to the admonitions they receive; if they manife&s;t an aver&s;ion to &s;tudy, em|ployment, and application; if they have no ta&s;te but for plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation; if they take no pains to reform their lives and mend their manners; if, I &s;ay, &s;uch a &s;cene &s;trikes my view, it in&s;tantly di&s;gu&s;ts me; I find my&s;elf in a &s;ituation that wounds my feelings, and I ha&s;ten to quit a hou&s;e in
<PB N="66" REF="030594_0065_0FE7F531422BC940">which I &s;ee nothing but the gloomy reign of di&s;order and di&s;traction.</P>
<P>All concur to e&s;tabli&s;h the noble and great precept of re&s;pect and obedience to parents: there is no difference on this &s;ub|ject between one nation and another, or between the poli&s;hed and &s;avage; all men have the &s;ame ideas on this head; it is na|ture that &s;peaks to the human heart; and if we find &s;ome individuals who refu&s;e to li&s;ten to, and acknowledge her voice, they are mon&s;ters in human &s;hape.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the duties we owe our parents, we may proceed to examine tho&s;e of brothers and &s;i&s;ters, to one ano|ther.&mdash;We may recollect here, that So|crates had been accu&s;tomed to compare brothers and &s;i&s;ters to the twin members of the human body; that is to &s;ay, to the eyes, to the hands, and to the feet. This compari&s;on is well adapted to the &s;ubject under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and gives us a ju&s;t and natural idea of the manner in which the
<PB N="67" REF="030594_0066_0FE7F537DBFBA2A0">children of a well-regulated family &s;hould conduct them&s;elves to one another. The meaning of Socrates is clearly expre&s;&s;ed by this compari&s;on. He gives us to un|der&s;tand, that the &s;ame harmony, depend|ence, and agreement which nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed between our members, &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between brothers and &s;i&s;ters; as we cannot conceive a greater union than that of the hands or the feet; &s;o nature, religion, and rea&s;on al&s;o combine to impo&s;e on bro|thers and &s;i&s;ters the duty of a &s;trict, &s;incere, and indi&s;&s;oluble union. As there is but one ma&s;ter or head in a family to direct and conduct it, &s;o in like manner the members of our body are &s;ubject to one and the &s;ame head to regulate and govern the whole: they &s;hould, therefore, like the hands and feet, have but one and the &s;ame inclina|tion, concord, object, and manner of acting.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip as pure, as unchangeable as the ties of kindred which bind them to one another, &s;hould reign among&s;t them. Look around, and you may ob&s;erve this union kept up throughout all nature. If we are
<PB N="68" REF="030594_0067_0FE7F539749CCFA0">naturally di&s;po&s;ed to form connections with per&s;ons with whom perchance we have pa&s;&s;ed our juvenile days; if the recollec|tion of them pre&s;ents to our minds &s;ome plea&s;ing ideas; and we are overjoyed and tran&s;ported at &s;eeing them, when oppor|tunity offers; How much more fond and endearing mu&s;t be the connection between brothers and &s;i&s;ters! Children of the &s;ame parents; reared on the &s;ame bo&s;om; fed at the &s;ame table; and lodged under the &s;ame roof: they have pa&s;&s;ed their happie&s;t days together, the days of innocence and &s;impli|city: the fir&s;t office of their tender limbs was to embrace one another: they commu|nicated their dawning &s;entiments of joy and friend&s;hip at an early &s;ea&s;on: they pa&s;&s;ed entire days in &s;ports and pa&s;times &s;uitable to their age: they mutually felt the &s;ame plea&s;ure, pain, joy, and melancholy: their &s;orrows were dimini&s;hed from the con&s;ola|tion they admini&s;tered to one another, and their joys increa&s;ed from the &s;atisfaction they felt in &s;haring them: they had the &s;ame friends and the &s;ame enemies: they united with the former, and defended them|&s;elves
<PB N="69" REF="030594_0068_0FE7F5402D897498">again&s;t the latter, to whom their union rendered them formidable. They have been educated in the &s;ame principles, in the &s;ame religion, in the &s;ame precepts, in the &s;ame &s;chools, and under the &s;ame ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>What more powerful motives could com|bine to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;olid and permanent union among mankind! From this friend&s;hip, which &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between brothers and &s;i&s;ters, naturally proceed other duties; for in&s;tance, they &s;hould &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another by their reciprocal kind offices and good coun&s;el, with candour, charity, and tenderne&s;s. This conduct will at once en|&s;ure them &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;trengthen their powers. The following relation proves the ju&s;tne&s;s of the a&s;&s;ertion. "A king, at the point of death, &s;ent for his children, who were very numerous: he pre&s;ented to them, in turn, a bundle of &s;mall &s;ticks, de&s;iring each to break them all together: it was at|tempted by every one of them individually, but could not be done. The father took the bundle in his hand, untied it, and ea|&s;ily
<PB N="70" REF="030594_0069_0FE7F541C73CDFF0">broke the &s;ticks one by one. He then embraced the opportunity of telling them their &s;ituation might be compared to the bundle of &s;ticks: while they were united they would be &s;trong and invincible; but the moment they were di&s;united, they would become feeble, and the mere butt of their enemies."</P>
<P>In fact, there is nothing equal to unani|mity, and a good under&s;tanding between brothers and &s;i&s;ters. By that bond, one of them acts with the vigour of all; for if there be two or &s;even united, each of them is no more than one individual; and in the&s;e &s;even you will find but one, and in one you will find &s;even. Should one be in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he is not therefore in di&s;tre&s;s; he is powerful in the greater par|ty, namely, the &s;ix others; and the party that falls, is in&s;tantly &s;upported, the weaker by the &s;tronger. Each of them &s;ees, not only with his own eyes, but even with tho&s;e of others; he not only walks on his own feet, but al&s;o on tho&s;e of others; he not only works with his own hands, but
<PB N="71" REF="030594_0070_0FE7F54875633898">with tho&s;e of others; he is not alone the guardian of his own affairs, others al&s;o at|tend to them. It is thus that union cements &s;ociety, and that one individual becomes many.</P>
<P>Such is the beauty of this virtue, that it renders happy and pro&s;perous tho&s;e fami|lies which po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and that it contributes infinitely more to their felicity than their wealth and riches. Wherever it exi&s;ts, there is order, peace, and harmony; where it is not, there is trouble, confu&s;ion, and di&s;order. The e&s;&s;ential duty of brothers and &s;i&s;ters is, to e&s;tabli&s;h union and frater|nal happine&s;s among them&s;elves, and care|fully to avoid every thing that may di&s;turb or overturn them. In a family, every mem|ber &s;hould con&s;ider him&s;elf as a part of the whole, to which he belongs; and the beau|ty and &s;trength of the whole e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t in the union and agreement of the parts which compo&s;e it, and which &s;hould all tend to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that of peace, utility, and public pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="030594_0071_0FE7F54A12CC9B58">
One of the mo&s;t effectual means to pre|&s;erve this union, is to &s;uppre&s;s, in time, di&s;|putes, controver&s;y, and bickering in a fa|mily, which, from trifles in the beginning, might end badly, and terminate even in open and &s;candalous ruptures. We &s;hould recollect that as great rivers flow from &s;mall &s;ources, in like manner mighty affairs ari&s;e from trivial cau&s;es. If the&s;e &s;trifes and di|vi&s;ions which are rai&s;ed in certain families, and which appear to have been always a wall of &s;eparation between them, be traced back to their fir&s;t origin, we &s;hould be ju&s;tly a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;uch weak motives produce &s;uch dire effects. As tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es of the body which communicate, and gradually approach its neighbouring parts, attack and corrupt them, are the mo&s;t danger|ous, and in&s;tantly demand the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the phy&s;ician, in order to pre&s;erve the &s;ound members; &s;o, in like manner, when any offence is given, or mi&s;under&s;tanding takes place between families, they &s;hould &s;uppre&s;s it in time, by checking its pro|gre&s;s, and &s;tifling it in its birth, to prevent

<P>What we advance here concerning bro|thers and &s;i&s;ters, may be equally applied to others, as we &s;hall find it to be the ca&s;e, in pointing out the duties we are obliged to perform as members of &s;ociety, and accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of the world. The&s;e du|ties are compri&s;ed in two plain precepts, which are the foundation and &s;ummary of all morality: <HI>Do unto others as you would they &s;hould do unto you; and Do not unto them what you would not they &s;hould do unto you.</HI> The&s;e two maxims, well con&s;idered, give us an idea and knowledge of the obligations we have to fulfil in the commerce of civil life. One is in the affirmative, and com|mands; the other is negative, and forbids. By the fir&s;t, we are enjoined <HI>to do unto others what we would they &s;hould do unto us;</HI> that is to &s;ay, we &s;hould procure for others every good which we wi&s;h they &s;hould render us; treat them as we de|&s;ire they &s;hould treat us; act on the &s;ame
<PB N="74" REF="030594_0073_0FE7F550B316DB80">principles towards them, as we expect they &s;hould act to us; and have the &s;ame regards, cares, officiou&s;ne&s;s, and attentions for them, which we require they &s;hould have for us. By the &s;econd, we are forbid <HI>to do to others what we would not they &s;hould do unto us;</HI> that is to &s;ay, by putting our&s;elves in the &s;ituation of others, and judging of them by our&s;elves, we &s;hould avoid doing them any injury which we would not have done to our&s;elves; or committing the &s;ame offences, and doing the &s;ame wrongs to them, which we would not wi&s;h them to do unto us. The&s;e principles are certain, &s;imple, and na|tural; they are the foundation and cement of all human &s;ociety; they &s;hould then be a rule of conduct to govern us in our in|tercour&s;e with mankind in general, and par|ticularly tho&s;e with whom we live and have the mo&s;t intimate connection.</P>
<P>Before we proceed further in the expla|nation of the&s;e precepts, it would be pro|per to examine here the nature of &s;ociety, and what is &s;ignified by the term.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="030594_0074_0FE7F5525BE6C2E0">
Society is an union of many individuals, who pre&s;erve their exi&s;tence by the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance they lend one another, and the connections which unite them together. God, the great author of our nature, having formed it in &s;uch a manner, that it is in&s;uffici|ent in it&s;elf, or in a &s;olitary &s;tate, he has or|dained, that it &s;hould be &s;upported by other aid. He has &s;o wi&s;ely di&s;po&s;ed all things, that the mutual helps derived from &s;ociety make ample amends for all our wants and in&s;ufficiency. He has therefore given us this one world &s;olely for our habitation: he has created one &s;un to give light to the world: he has extended the heavens as one &s;pacious canopy to cover us. Wherefore do we build cities, hou&s;es, and public &s;quares, but to be united together, not only by the &s;ame habitation, but &s;till more by the ties of fra|ternity, and like the con&s;tituent parts of one and the &s;ame body. The moral is ju&s;tly a&s;&s;imilated to the natural body of each individual, which is compo&s;ed of many members that aid and &s;upport one ano|ther, by the faithful di&s;charge of that duty which Providence has a&s;&s;igned to
<PB N="76" REF="030594_0075_0FE7F5590266EDE0">each: the feet &s;u&s;tain; the hands act; the eyes &s;ee; the ears hear; and &s;o on. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e different mem|bers deny the &s;ervices which nature re|quires; that the feet remain in a &s;tate of inaction; the hands without motion; the teeth without di&s;charging their function; What would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch di&s;order, if not certain death and a total de&s;truction of the&s;e different parts? Thus it would be with the body of &s;ociety, if all the individuals, who are its members, &s;hould refu&s;e their reciprocal aid, and interrupt the mutual communication. They would remain in a &s;tate of torpor and inaction. Such a derangement would nece&s;&s;arily oc|ca&s;ion the di&s;&s;olution of the whole body. As edifices are built with &s;tones fa&s;tened by the cement which unites them; and as the moment a cha&s;m is made by the failure of the &s;tones, the whole &s;tructure tum|bles into ruins; in like manner, the pre|&s;ervation of the human &s;pecies entirely de|pends on the union, agreement, and a&s;&s;em|blage of the parts. Without union and good order, no government can be well ad|mini&s;tered,
<PB N="77" REF="030594_0076_0FE7F55A992D01E0">no city can be well governed, no hou&s;es well arranged, and no family well reguated. The &s;pirit of union and peace is then the fir&s;t duty impo&s;ed on us in &s;ociety. This &s;pirit is the more nece&s;&s;ary to us, as our intere&s;ts are connected with tho&s;e of the public, and &s;o blended with them, that when the&s;e are injured, ours &s;uffer in the &s;ame proportion; &s;o that our private advantages and welfare oblige us to be peaceable, humane, gentle, patient, gene|rous, moderate, friendly, ju&s;t, benevolent, and, in &s;hort, to po&s;&s;e&s;s every quality which contributes to good order, and maintains the union of &s;ociety; that is to &s;ay, <HI>we ought to do unto others as we would they &s;hould do unto us; and we ought not to do unto others what we do not wi&s;h they &s;hould do unto us.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e general principles, we now enter into a detail, which will render the&s;e truths more obvious, and give us a more particular and practical knowledge of the duties which we have to perform to others. Let us begin by acknowledging here what
<PB N="78" REF="030594_0077_0FE7F560ED3DF478">is unhappily too true, that we all have our foibles. Of the&s;e, humanity, in its neare&s;t approaches to perfection, is by no means dive&s;ted. The great and low, the rich and poor, the young and old, have, all, their imperfections. Notwith&s;tanding any en|comiums that may be be&s;towed on us; any adulation we may &s;wallow; any pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions we may have concerning our pretended merit; and the favourable opi|nion we may entertain in our own behalf; notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e we really have vices and imperfections. Perhaps we may not be thoroughly acquainted with them; we may not perceive them, as they really are, becau&s;e &s;elf-love and pride, of which we have an abundant &s;tock, prevent us from knowing our&s;elves. But tho&s;e with whom we have connections in the commerce of life, and with whom we live, are perfect judges of our foibles, errors, and evil pro|pen&s;ities.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that we have all to reproach our&s;elves with certain faults and imperfec|tions; that we are &s;ubject to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="79" REF="030594_0078_0FE7F56284F27AC0">either of pride or anger, envy or fa &s;lander, calumny, or any other imperfection whatever: What follows, and what thence &s;hould we conclude for our conduct in life? It follows thence that human indulgence has every right to make an allowance for human failings: We &s;hould all mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t, par|don, and excu&s;e one another. The glimmer|ings of rea&s;on are &s;ufficient to convince us of the nece&s;&s;ity of this rule. There is nothing indeed more natural than to believe we &s;hould be treated as we treat others. If we judge without mercy, we will be judged with &s;e|verity: if we make the faults of others the &s;ubject of our cen&s;ures, they will not &s;pare us in their animadver&s;ions: if we are not in|clined to render them any kindne&s;&s;es, they will be ill di&s;po&s;ed to &s;how any to us: if we are bitter to them, can we expect they will be plea&s;ant to us? The &s;pirit of &s;weetne&s;s, moderation, prudence, di&s;cretion, charity, patience, goodne&s;s, and humanity, is nece&s;|&s;arily the &s;pirit which &s;hould actuate us in &s;ociety; we mu&s;t therefore make it our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to acquire it.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="030594_0079_0FE7F569302800C0">
Nothing can contribute to in&s;pire us with this &s;pirit &s;o much, as the knowledge of the human heart, and e&s;pecially that of our own. Becau&s;e when we perceive in others tho&s;e errors, of which we can trace the &s;ource in our&s;elves, we &s;hould therefore feel di&s;po&s;ed to grant them that indulgence which we, on our part, require, and thereby conduct our|&s;elves towards them with a &s;weet, affable, gentle, mode&s;t, and &s;ocial temper.</P>
<P>As this knowledge of the human heart is the con&s;equence of reflection and experi|ence, of which youth is not capable, it is of &s;ome moment to a&s;&s;i&s;t you here in a pur|&s;uit &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the cour&s;e of life. You will a&s;k perhaps, Is every one unacquaint|ed with him&s;elf? Have we occa&s;ion to &s;tudy the knowledge of our&s;elves? You believe not; but you are mi&s;taken; for the propo|&s;ition is exactly true, that the generality of mankind to not know them&s;elves. In fact, there are few who direct their attention in|wardly, who &s;tudy them&s;elves, who examine their inclinations, characters, feelings, and pa&s;&s;ions of the heart, which are the chief
<PB N="81" REF="030594_0080_0FE7F56ACBD31D68">rulers of their actions and their entire con|duct. We have eyes to &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es abroad, and &s;eldom con&s;ider what pa&s;&s;es within us. Hence it has been wittily remark|ed by a certain philo&s;opher, that we carry a &s;ack on our &s;houlders, in which are con|tained our own faults, and tho&s;e of others: the latter are in that part of the &s;ack which is expo&s;ed to view; the former are behind, and concealed in &s;uch a manner that we cannot perceive them.</P>
<P>Self-love, which domineers over us, con|ceals from us the &s;ecret avenues to the &s;oul; makes us blind to our own failings; and pre|vents us from &s;eeing our&s;elves as we are, or di&s;covering the faults which are really exi&s;ting in us. It is &s;ometimes carried to &s;uch an extreme, and gives the mind &s;uch a bias, that &s;ome of our pa&s;&s;ions, which are really vicious, and deemed &s;o by all tho&s;e who know us intimately, derive the name of virtues from our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Interrogate the avaricious man on the &s;ub|ject of avarice: a&s;k him what he thinks of

<P>Interrogate the prodigal, who ruins him|&s;elf and family by &s;illy, thoughtle&s;s, and ex|travagant expences, and you will be &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find that he aggrandizes his pa&s;|&s;ion with the elevated names of genero&s;ity, liberality, and greatne&s;s of &s;oul.</P>
<P>Interrogate the choleric and pa&s;&s;ionate man, who, in the height of his phrenzy, &s;pares neither women, children, relations, nor friends, and he will tell you that in him

<P>Interrogate the rich man, who affects haughty, proud, di&s;dainful, and arrogant manners, and you will find that he imagines the&s;e manners corre&s;pond with his rank, fortune, and con&s;equence; and that they give him an air of grandeur in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>Interrogate a young lady upon her im|mode&s;t behaviour; her de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, by &s;tudied and affected cares; by the finery of her toilet, where the rules of decency and virtue are laid a&s;ide; and by proceedings and conduct which breathe too much free|dom and licentiou&s;ne&s;s: &s;he will tell you, that it is thus they live in the world; that what is fa&s;hionable cannot &s;eem offen&s;ive; and, fi|nally, that too much rea&s;on and wi&s;dom are not adapted to her years, which prove the &s;ea&s;on of plea&s;ure.

<P>Continue to examine this &s;ame young per&s;on on her different defects; for in&s;tance, on her aver&s;ion for &s;tudy and application.

Tell her that nothing can be com|pared to the advantages which a &s;olid and well-&s;upported education procures; that it tends at once to form the heart and judgment; that it enriches the under&s;tand|ing, and furni&s;hes us with u&s;eful and agree|able information, which remains with us during life, and accompanies us through every vici&s;&s;itude; that it is the ornament of

Tell her that reading e&s;&s;entially contributes to &s;often our manners, and give us a &s;weet, gentle, poli&s;hed turn of beha|viour, which endears us to &s;ociety; that there is no better companion than a good book, which conveys the language of truth, makes u acquainted with our imperfec|tions and lays down rules of conduct and good morals. Repre&s;ent all the&s;e to the young per&s;on of whom we &s;peak; examine her &s;ituation; enquire into he cau&s;e of her indifference to tho&s;e objects &s;o worthy of fixing her attention; and you will di&s;cover that the &s;ource of evil is derived from her ignorance of her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he does not judge of her&s;elf from the truths which you dictate to her, but rather from the fal&s;e|hoods of &s;ome &s;oul-deceiving flatterer who in&s;inuates, and ince&s;&s;antly repeats to her,

She &s;wallows this gro&s;s adulation; betrays her&s;elf into an idea of virtues &s;he has not; grows con|firmed in the vices &s;he has; and thus com|mences the career of her future misfortunes.</P>
<P>Judge your&s;elf, and you will agree to the truth of the&s;e remarks. Though they were not pre&s;ented to your mind before the pre&s;ent times, they will become more intel|ligible to you as you advance in years and experience.</P>
<P>In order to facilitate the means of your becoming acquainted with your&s;elf, it re|mains for me to give you a few remarks relative to the rea&s;ons, why the bulk of mankind do not know them&s;elves.</P>
<P>By reflecting a moment on the cau&s;e of &s;uch an effect, we &s;hall perceive that it de|rives its &s;ource from that inexhau&s;tible fund of &s;elf-love which we feel within us; from

A prudent and experienced mother, a wi&s;e and virtuous friend, &s;trive in vain to expo&s;tulate with her, and explain her duties: in vain they tell her what renders a young per&s;on amia|ble and de&s;erving; not exterior advantages, nor the graces of form and per&s;on, but in|terior qualities, tho&s;e of the heart and un|der&s;tanding; &s;weet, open, innocent, and natural manners.

It is thus that &s;elf-love mi&s;leads her; deprives her of the knowledge of her imperfections; and prevents her from embracing the means of correcting them. It would not be a diffi|cult ta&s;k to prove that it produces the &s;ame effects in a more advanced age, and that mankind in general are, in a great degree, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it.</P>
<P>From what has been premi&s;ed, follows this truth, that the knowledge of our&s;elves is of the highe&s;t importance to us, in order that we &s;hould &s;et about the work of re|form and regulation of our conduct and mo|rals. In fact, it is with the maladies of the &s;oul as with tho&s;e of the body. Why is a phy&s;ician called to a &s;ick per&s;on, and how does he begin to exerci&s;e his art? His fir&s;t care is to &s;tudy the di&s;ea&s;e which he wi&s;hes to conquer; to di&s;cover the origin, cau&s;e, and progre&s;s of it; afterwards, by means of this preliminary information, he applies tho&s;e remedies which he deems fit and ne|ce&s;&s;ary. This mode of treatment is much
<PB N="90" REF="030594_0089_0FE7F593A60DF568">the &s;ame as that which we &s;hould ob&s;erve with re&s;pect to the di&s;tempered &s;oul, who&s;e maladies are the vices and pa&s;&s;ions which govern us inwardly; be&s;et the under&s;tand|ing; and hold it in a &s;ort of captivity and infirmity. Now, I &s;ay, if we wi&s;h to un|dertake their cure, the fir&s;t thing we have to do is, to di&s;cover the nature of them. But how &s;hall we come at this knowledge? By examining what pa&s;&s;es within us; by &s;tudy|ing the propen&s;ities, inclinations, and di&s;po&s;itions of the heart; by judging our&s;elves without the partiality and illu&s;ions of &s;elf-love; by erecting a tribunal within, to de|termine on all our actions; by finding out, in particular, our ruling pa&s;&s;ion, or the chief and main &s;pring of all the re&s;t. When once we have made this inve&s;tigation, and come to the knowledge of our&s;elves, it will be ea&s;y to make u&s;e of them towards the re|gulation of our conduct, and correct what we find imperfect, defective, and vicious in our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This &s;tudy of our&s;elves has been judged &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in all ages, that the only in|&s;cription

<P>Among the&s;e advantages, there is one I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you here, and which de|mands, on your part, a particular attention. It is, that the knowledge of our&s;elves con|tributes e&s;&s;entially to that of others: it ren|ders us capable of judging their actions, and valuing them according to their worth. In fact, we have all nearly the &s;ame incli|nations, and the &s;ame mixture of good and evil. The different good and bad qualities are modified more or le&s;s in every indivi|dual, according to circum&s;tances; but the feelings, the rece&s;&s;es of the heart are the &s;ame; &s;o that the knowledge of our own pa&s;&s;ions &s;ummarily repre&s;ents to us tho&s;e of others, and makes us capable of judging them. Ob&s;erve that I do not &s;peak here of a certain de&s;cription of men, who &s;eem born for the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, and are
<PB N="92" REF="030594_0091_0FE7F59BCB79F148">a &s;candal and di&s;grace to humanity. Such beings are mon&s;ters in nature; and it is not by mon&s;ters that we are to judge of a whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>I repeat to you, that the &s;ubject which is here offered to you, namely, the know|ledge of mankind, merits your attention; and the ob&s;ervations you are about to re|ceive, may be of great utility in the prac|tice of life; in forming your judgment; enabling you to di&s;tingui&s;h real merit from appearances; and giving you a ju&s;t idea of virtue.</P>
<P>Let us begin by advancing, that we are not to con&s;ider man in the &s;ame point of view we do a picture. The beauty of the latter, the proportion, the judicious blend|ing of light and &s;hade, are almo&s;t di&s;cover|ed at the fir&s;t glance: We &s;hould be gro&s;sly mi&s;taken to judge thus of man, on our fir&s;t interview.

<P><PB N="93" REF="030594_0092_0FE7F5A29BF48A38">
We may con&s;ider man here in a twofold capacity: in one, as confined to private life, in the company of his wife, children, and dome&s;tics: in the other, as mingling with &s;ociety, for bu&s;ine&s;s, for plea&s;ure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> ful|filling the exterior obligations of his office, or di&s;charging the duties of decorum. The premi&s;es being admitted, in order to come to a knowledge of him, in which of the&s;e two conditions is he to be examined? Is it in the latter, that is to &s;ay, when he ap|pears in public? No&mdash;not at all: That is not the proper time for forming an idea of his character. Why &s;o? Becau&s;e it often happens, that we only then &s;ee his exterior or out&s;ide. He is, as it were, out of his &s;phere, and &s;o little like him&s;elf, that if you compare him in the&s;e two &s;ituations, you will rather &s;uppo&s;e that there are two di&s;tinct individuals in que&s;tion, than one and the &s;ame man placed in different points of view. Let us explain our meaning, and endeavour to render this truth obvious. Man, when expo&s;ed to the public eye, puts on the ap|pearance of virtues he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s. He &s;tudies his manners, frames his di&s;|cour&s;e,
<PB N="94" REF="030594_0093_0FE7F5A435263F38">culls his words, and acts in &s;uch a manner as to give his whole exterior an air of virtue: he practi&s;es every art on him|&s;elf: he ma&s;ks and conceals his real cha|racter: &s;he impo&s;es &s;ilence on his pa&s;&s;ions; affects a countenance which prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and di&s;po&s;es the mind to judge favour|ably of him: &s;o that if you examine him only in this point of view, and without going further, you cannot help forming of man in general, the mo&s;t advantageous ideas. You will confound, in your own opinion, the good man with the wicked, becau&s;e both &s;peak the &s;ame language, that of virtue; both expre&s;s the &s;ame &s;entiments of piety, gentlene&s;s goodne&s;s, benevolence, humanity, ju&s;tice, mode&s;ty, temperance, and love of the public good; and both re&s;emble each other in words. No compari&s;on, how|ever, can be made between them; and the di&s;tance which &s;eparates them is as im|men&s;e as that between heaven and earth; becau&s;e the one acts the hypocrite, and plays a part which is not his own; the other acts naturally and from principle, and proves that his exterior corre&s;ponds with
<PB N="95" REF="030594_0094_0FE7F5AABA89A820">his interior, by the agreement of his and &s;entiments. But this difference, how|ever great, will not become &s;en&s;ible to you, if you con&s;ider them only under certain cir|cum&s;tances, and by their di&s;cour&s;e; as in reality all men are nearly &s;imilar to each other in the&s;e particulars. But in what are they unlike each other, and in what do they e&s;&s;entially differ? In their actions, their conduct, and their morals.</P>
<P>It is only in this point of view we &s;hould judge of a man, in order to know him, and e&s;timate his real merit. Hence we have but to examine him, when he is re&s;tored to him&s;elf, and moves in his natural &s;phere; for in&s;tance, when he is at home, in his hou&s;e, in the centre of his family, conver|&s;ing, eating, and drinking with his wife and children, and ordering his dome&s;tics. It is there, as Plato remarks, that he acts either well or ill: it is there the ma&s;k falls off, the heart and inclinations appear without di&s;gui&s;e, and the man as he really is. Why &s;o? you will &s;ay. Becau&s;e a man, when at
<PB N="96" REF="030594_0095_0FE7F5AC56BA7370">home, has nothing to check, re&s;train him, or alter the features of his character. He practi&s;es every art in the pre&s;ence of &s;tran|gers; but that re&s;traint cea&s;es in the &s;o|ciety of tho&s;e with whom he re&s;ides, and who are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee him, to hear him, and ob&s;erve his daily actions.</P>
<P>This method of proceeding, in order to become acquainted with the human heart, is the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and experience, which point it out as the one mo&s;t certain, and lea&s;t &s;ubject to error. Yet it is not the mode which is commonly followed. The generality of mankind judge from exterior, deceitful, and fal&s;e appearances. Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed as we are in favour of honour and riches, we are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to con|ceive advantageous ideas of tho&s;e who en|joy them. We are apt to believe that a man's merit is in proportion to his fortune; and that the opulent have claims to our e&s;teem, to which the lower orders have no preten&s;ions. When your mind takes &s;uch a wrong bias it concerns you to be unde|ceived,
<PB N="97" REF="030594_0096_0FE7F5920BF23270">and to acquire ju&s;t ideas of the in|trin&s;ic value of things. A little reflection is &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Is it not truly a&s;toni&s;hing, that in the e&s;ti|mation of men we follow a cour&s;e quite dif|ferent from that which &s;erves as a &s;tandard, by which we value all other things exi&s;ting in nature, and that man is the only being we judge of from fal&s;e principles? When we have occa&s;ion to buy any thing for our own u&s;e, what qualities do we require in the &s;ort we want? Are the&s;e qualities merely exterior? Do we con&s;ider interior excellence as nothing? If, for example, we have oc|ca&s;ion for a hor&s;e, how do we proceed in our choice? Do we examine only the finery of the bridle, &s;addle, and trappings? On the contrary, do we not &s;trip him of all the&s;e, in order to &s;ee him naked, and &s;uch as he really is? Do we not make trial of him? Do we not ob&s;erve his gait in walk|ing, trotting, pacing, &amp;c. in order to be a&s;&s;ured of his qualities, and to find out tho&s;e which con&s;titute a good hor&s;e? Take a view of every object which occurs in the
<PB N="98" REF="030594_0097_0FE7F5B2CE9DCE58">commerce of life, and you may ob&s;erve, that we con&s;tantly pur&s;ue this mode of pro|ceeding which is dictated by the mo&s;t com|mon &s;entiments of wi&s;dom, prudence, and good &s;en&s;e. We never &s;ay that a &s;word is good, becau&s;e it has a fine &s;cabbard; nor that a hou&s;e is &s;olid, becau&s;e it has a hand|&s;ome out&s;ide. We do not buy, as they &s;ay, a pig in a bag. Why do we not fol|low the &s;ame rule with re&s;pect to man? He is rich, you &s;ay; he is powerful; he has high birth and dignity. Agreed: but all the&s;e do not con&s;titute him&s;elf: they are merely exterior. In order to know him, I &s;hould &s;trip him of all the&s;e; examine him&s;elf only, and &s;uch as he is, exclu&s;ive of all that &s;urrounds him, his pomp and titles. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the virtues of his condition; if he fulfils the duties of his &s;tation; if he fills it with ho|nour and intregity; if he is a good hu&s;|band, a good father, a good friend; if pro&s;perity does not render him proud and in&s;olent; adver&s;ity, creeping and &s;ervile; if he is religious, good, friendly, mode&s;t, pru|dent, patient, and moderate. If he has, in
<PB N="99" REF="030594_0098_0FE7F5B46468D8B8">&s;hort, the qualities of a meritorious man. If I find that his &s;oul is endued with the&s;e virtues, he is then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of real riches; riches which are preferable to the world's wealth. If, on the contrary, I per|ceive in him a &s;oul plunged in vice, and de|ba&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ions, low &s;entiments, and a continual oppo&s;ition to the principles of vir|tue, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and moderation, then he appears to me poor indeed, and truly contemptible, if he had all the opulence, grandeur, and trea&s;ures of Croe&s;us.</P>
<P>Were I to &s;peak of the conduct of a fe|male, I would canva&s;s it in the &s;ame manner. I do not a&s;k if &s;he is fond of appearing in &s;ociety and in polite circles; of &s;hewing away in public; of di&s;playing her pomp, luxury, and expence; if the cares of the toilet take up a part of her time; or, if &s;he is rich in jewels and exterior ornaments? I do not a&s;k the&s;e things, nor any other que&s;|tion of this nature. I only enquire if &s;he has the virtues of her condition? If, &s;in|cerely attached to her hu&s;band, &s;he limits all her de&s;ires to plea&s;e him? If, attentive
<PB N="100" REF="030594_0099_0FE7F5BAE7D81E78">to the employments which nature a&s;&s;igned her, &s;he orders and governs her dome&s;tic affairs, at the &s;ame time that &s;he attends to tho&s;e abroad? If, in her family, &s;he has an eye to every thing becoming her &s;ex, and acts in &s;uch a manner as to produce order, union and pro&s;perity, and that the different members which con&s;titute it, perform their re&s;pective duties, and contribute to the har|mony and beauty of the whole? If, confi|ned within the dome&s;tic circle, &s;he knows how to in&s;pire her children with awe, re|verence, and filial live? If &s;he devotes her mo&s;t precious moments to the care of their education? If &s;he con&s;iders this care as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able of all duties? If &s;he makes her happine&s;s, glory, and highe&s;t con&s;olation con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e? The&s;e are the points upon which I &s;hould examine her; the&s;e her obligations, and the virtues which form the merit of her character.</P>
<P>I &s;hall treat a young lady in the &s;ame manner. I &s;hall not con&s;ider if &s;he is hand|&s;ome, or in what degree &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the charms of per&s;on; if &s;he is a coquette, and
<PB N="101" REF="030594_0100_0FE7F5BC872B3480">only employed in the vanity of dre&s;s, and the arts of plea&s;ing; or, if &s;he attends every a&s;&s;embly and party of plea&s;ure? but I &s;hall con&s;ider, if &s;he has qualities becoming her years; if &s;he receives a good education; if &s;he profits thereby; and, if cha&s;tity, mo|de&s;ty, evenne&s;s of temper, &s;olid under&s;tand|ing, reflection, and application fall to her lot?</P>
<P>Such is the rule which leads me to the knowledge of any per&s;on whatever, high or low, rich or poor, young or old. I will judge and value him according to his pecu|liar and per&s;onal qualities, and not by ap|parent and &s;uppo&s;ed virtues. I &s;hall there|fore examine, if he properly di&s;charges the duties of his &s;tation; the obligations which relate to his age, &s;ituation, talents, and rank; for in this line of conduct con&s;i&s;ts the dig|nity of man. It con&s;titutes his merit; di&s;|tingui&s;hes him from others; and renders him truly e&s;timable. And what is virtue, but the accompli&s;hment of the duties of that &s;tate in which Providence has placed us.</P>

We all wi&s;h to be happy: it is the fir&s;t de&s;ire of every rea&s;onable creature: it is the common ambition of all men: it is the end of their labours, and the main object of their pur&s;uits. Yes: Mankind &s;igh after what they call happine&s;s, and &s;trive to ob|tain it. But do they di&s;cover this happi|ne&s;s they are in que&s;t of, and do they all equally enjoy it? By no means. And why not? Becau&s;e few &s;eek it where it is; but many pur&s;ue it where it is not. Some indeed imagine that it &s;olely con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, and u&s;e every means to obtain riches. Some placing it in the plea&s;ure of the &s;en&s;es, give them&s;elves up entirely to the gratification of their pa&s;|&s;ions. Others, in fine, per&s;uaded that vir|tue alone can make them happy, are en|tirely devoted to it, and make it the rule of their conduct. I now a&s;k you, Which are they who appear to you the mo&s;t wi&s;e and prudent in their pur&s;uits? Are they tho&s;e votaries of fortune, or the&s;e &s;laves of their plea&s;ures and pa&s;&s;ions? Not at all; they are neither the one nor the other, though you might have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o &s;ome|times.
<PB N="105" REF="030594_0104_0FE7F5CCC1AED8E0">But it is time to undeceiv give you &s;ome ju&s;t conceptions of the&s;e mat|ters.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I mu&s;t remark, that riches can|not of them&s;elves con&s;titute real happine&s;s. In fact, whatever prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions we may have for wealth and honours, they are, notwith&s;tanding, no more than a vapour that vani&s;hes, a mere &s;hadow, that attracts but to mock us in its &s;udden flight. Riches are not centred in us; neither are they the whole, nor a part of us. They are outward appendages, merely accidental to us. We may be men of integrity and virtue with|out po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. Wealth may fall to the lot of the wicked; and too frequently they purcha&s;e it at a dear price, the price of in|nocence and probity. It cannot communi|cate to us tho&s;e qualities which alone are e&s;&s;ential to man, I mean, piety, ju&s;tice, pru|dence, goodne&s;s, &amp;c. The&s;e virtues are independent of riches: they may be met with in the cottage of the poor, as well as in the palace of the great. To render the
<PB N="106" REF="030594_0105_0FE7F5D3448BD950">truth of the&s;e principles more obvious to you, let us make this &s;imple and natural &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e two youths, the one the child of wealthy, the other of indigent parents; conceive the former, a haughty, arrogant, untractable, ignorant, idle young man, without piety towards God; without re&s;pect to his parents; addicted to &s;wearing, lying, and every vice which &s;prings from a bad heart and corrupt &s;oul. Suppo&s;e the latter a virtuous youth, who fears God; is &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to his parents; docile to his &s;upe|riors; mode&s;t in his conver&s;ation; regular in his morals; fond of indu&s;try, &s;tudy, and application; endued with every virtue adapted to his age; and worthy to be con|&s;idered as a model to all his acquaintance. The compari&s;on admitted, I now a&s;k you, which of the two would you wi&s;h to imi|tate? Does the condition of the fortunate youth, with his vices and imperfections, ap|pear to you preferable to that of the poor lad, with his virtues? Does the one, on ac|count
<PB N="107" REF="030594_0106_0FE7F5D4DD82B3E8">of his riches, &s;eem to you more e&s;ti|mable, more happy, or a greater object of envy than the other, on account of his po|verty? In &s;hort, were you to be one of them, and the freedom of choice to be given you, in who&s;e favour would you determine? In favour of the poor young man, you reply, without he&s;itation. I thought &s;o beforehand, and you are in the right of it; becau&s;e he enjoys the only true riches, tho&s;e alone which e&s;tabli&s;h the merit of a man; tho&s;e alone which are worthy of our prai&s;e and e&s;teem. In&s;tead of the&s;e, the other, with all his wealth and preten&s;ions, is no more than a coxcomb, who only claims our contempt and indignation. It is evident, you &s;ee, that riches do not make us happy.</P>
<P>I do not, however, mean to &s;ay, that riches are intrin&s;ically evil. This is by no means the idea I wi&s;h to convey. But I would give you to under&s;tand, that they are in them&s;elves of no moment. Like beauty or bodily &s;trength, they are the in|&s;truments either of good or evil: they are not &s;ufficient to make us happy and re&s;pect|able;

<P>If riches cannot procure happine&s;s for man, the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es are &s;till le&s;s capable. In fact, God, in creating us, has mingled in our very exi&s;tence the princi|ples of equity, mode&s;ty, and the differ|ent virtues nece&s;&s;ary to conduct us to that end for which we were intended. We were born with a ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition for order and virtue: hence it happens, that when we abandon our&s;elves to our unrea|&s;onable and unruly pa&s;&s;ions, we overturn that order e&s;tabli&s;hed by nature and God him&s;elf; we act in contradiction to our|&s;elves, and con&s;equently we become un|happy. This is truly the ca&s;e, and it is confirmed by daily experience. The di&s;|orderly pa&s;&s;ions, far from contributing to our felicity, are even the &s;ource of our &s;orrows. Vice is attended with trouble, anxiety, and unea&s;ine&s;s. It &s;ubdues the &s;oul but to bani&s;h peace and repo&s;e. It is like a running ulcer, which corrodes the heart. The guilty are puni&s;hed in the very com|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="109" REF="030594_0108_0FE7F5DD1AD28BF0">of their crimes, by the pangs of end|le&s;s remor&s;e, which wring the tortured &s;oul. Man, in a criminal &s;tate, is his own execu|tioner; and in proportion as he indulges in lawle&s;s plea&s;ures, he creates within his own bo&s;om, as it were, an oppo&s;ite chagrin, which da&s;hes the cup of joy with bitter|ne&s;s, and torments him in a thou&s;and &s;hapes.</P>
<P>But if it be thus as you tell me, that nei|ther plea&s;ures nor riches can make us hap|py, where then mu&s;t we &s;eek felicity?</P>
<P>Where &s;eek it? In piety, virtue, and the practice and performance of your du|ties. This is the great &s;ecret of happine&s;s; learn it then here; engrave it deeply on your hearts; and never forget, that our happine&s;s is placed in virtue only, and that a pure con&s;cience is the &s;ource of true plea|&s;ures, the parent of real felicity, and the remedy for all troubles; becau&s;e it puts us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;olid and permanent advan|tages. Riches delude us with ideas of ap|parent good, and at be&s;t are peri&s;hable. The malice of man may deprive us of them;
<PB N="110" REF="030594_0109_0FE7F5E3A6C91F78">the pa&s;&s;ions may &s;wallow them up; the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of fortune may turn them into other hands; and death at lea&s;t, &s;ooner or later, will compel us to part with them. But piety, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, charity, mo|de&s;ty, &amp;c. are the only riches which truly belong to us; the only wealth we can ac|quire and pre&s;erve; our only &s;hield again&s;t misfortunes and the malice of man; and our only companions through every change of life, in adver&s;ity, in pro&s;perity, in &s;ick|ne&s;s, in health, in old age, in youth, in death, and even beyond the grave. O happy &s;tate of virtue, why not better known to man!</P>
<P>O youth, of every denomination, in riches or poverty, if you wi&s;h to be happy, become virtuous; and you will then be as completely &s;o as it is po&s;&s;ible in this life. But then remember, you mu&s;t begin your career on the pre&s;ent moment. Con&s;ider (I cannot too often repeat it to you) that youth is the period which determines our &s;ucce&s;s in life, and the &s;ea&s;on in which we &s;hould lay the foundation of futurity: that
<PB N="111" REF="030594_0110_0FE7F5E537DF8720">it is in vain to pretend we mean to become good hereafter, if we do not now give &s;ome proofs of our intention. Begin then in time to &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue in your hearts, if you would wi&s;h to reap their fruits in &s;ea&s;on. Reflect that you have to conduct your whole life; a lingering &s;pace, perhaps, to travel over. Imitate then the wi&s;e and prudent man, who has a long voy|age to make. He ponders thereon, and employs a con&s;iderable time in providing every thing nece&s;&s;ary to render his voyage comfortable. Do you al&s;o make your pre|parations, and di&s;po&s;e of every thing in &s;uch a manner, as to enable you to &s;hape that unerring cour&s;e which you have to &s;teer through the ocean of life. You will meet with rocks and &s;hoals in your pa&s;&s;age, but you mu&s;t take care not to &s;plit on them. Imitate the wi&s;dom of the pilot: he does not wait till his ve&s;&s;el is battered by the &s;torm, to provide what is nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t it: he takes advantage of the calm, and makes his preparations in time. My chil|dren, the youth which you enjoy is pre|ci&s;ely the calm: it concerns you much to
<PB N="112" REF="030594_0111_0FE7F5EBEB3C09F8">benefit by it. Shortly indeed the tempe&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions will rife in your &s;ouls, and rage through all your &s;en&s;es. The ap|proaching hurricanes will &s;ink you, and re|duce you to a melancholy wreck, if you have not the precaution to prepare in time again&s;t the violence of their attacks.</P>
<P>If you already feel the fir&s;t approaches of the pa&s;&s;ions; if your heart begins to feel their fir&s;t emotions; what mu&s;t it be when they pre&s;ent them&s;elves? Labour then to bar their pa&s;&s;age to your &s;oul; or de&s;troy them in embryo, if they are near their birth. Do not wait therefore till they have taken root, and collected vigour; for then you would have much difficulty to di&s;|lodge them; and, almo&s;t in &s;pite of your efforts, they would domineer and tyrannize over you.</P>
<P>This moral you have conveyed to us, you will probably &s;ay, is good and excel|lent; we agree to it. The picture you have drawn of virtue renders it lovely, and removes the prejudices which might disfi|gure
<PB N="113" REF="030594_0112_0FE7F5ED86FA5C98">it in our eyes. We now paint it in the mo&s;t lively colours. We are per&s;uaded, with you, that virtue alone makes man a prai&s;e-worthy being, and greatly contri|butes to his happine&s;s. The explanation you have given of the different duties we have to perform towards God, mankind, and our&s;elves, is &s;en&s;ible and ju&s;t: it has made an impre&s;&s;ion on our minds: it has in&s;tructed us, and may be of infinite &s;ervice to us for the pre&s;ent, and the time to come. We have been particularly &s;truck with the force of your rea&s;oning, on the influence which youth has on future life, and the con&s;equences of the principles we receive in youth. Coinciding with you, we are entirely convinced that the&s;e principles cannot be in&s;pired or impre&s;&s;ed but by edu|tion. Hence we conclude, that a good education is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; that it is every thing; that on it depends the fate of life; and that nothing in the world can be compared to the advantages re&s;ulting from it. We con&s;ent to all the&s;e; and we con|fe&s;s that children, who have the opportu|nity
<PB N="114" REF="030594_0113_0FE7F5F437C84DD0">of receiving a good education, &s;hould embrace every means of benefiting by it. But here is one ob&s;tacle in our way; a bug|bear which terrifies us, di&s;courages, and checks our ardour: we mean the painful cares of education, which demand, on our part, labour, a&s;&s;iduity, &s;tudy, application, and a thou&s;and things which are repugnant and unplea&s;ant to youth. We mu&s;t labour, you &s;ay, to be formed by a good education and virtue.</P>
<P>You certainly mu&s;t; I agree with you in that a&s;&s;ertion; and I expre&s;sly declare to you, that labour is the duty impo&s;ed on you, as the condition, without which you cannot derive any &s;olid benefit from your education, were you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fine&s;t natural abilities, and the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;|ters. But permit me to a&s;k you, in my turn, what could you do or accompli&s;h in life without labour and application? Is not the whole cour&s;e of human life, from the cradle to the grave, one continued &s;cene of labour, cares, and fatigue?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="030594_0114_0FE7F5F5D5989080">
Let us con&s;ider man in his infancy at the very period in which his ideas begin to dawn, his rea&s;on to expand. Does it not co&s;t him &s;ome pains to know the u&s;e he &s;hould make of this rea&s;on. Wrapt in the deep gloom of ignorance, &s;urrounded on every &s;ide by objects he is unacquainted with, does it not co&s;t him infinite trouble to learn the name of each, its u&s;e, connection, convenience, and properties? All nature is a&s;toni&s;hing and my&s;terious to his view. He is to him&s;elf an impenetrable enigma. He has only language to enquire, and to a&s;k que&s;tions. The &s;en&s;es, tho&s;e admira|ble vehicles of information, di&s;cover and manife&s;t them&s;elves to him but at his own expence, and by the dint of repeated di&s;a|greeable and painful experiments. Arrived at the &s;ea&s;on of youth, is it not irk&s;ome to him to acquire that profe&s;&s;ion which he made his choice? Is he not obliged to devote a part of his time to &s;tudy at tho&s;e &s;chools which have been appointed him? Mu&s;t he obey them in every thing, and give him|&s;elf up diligently to all the exerci&s;es and
<PB N="116" REF="030594_0115_0FE7F5FC8E1AD700">different kinds of &s;tudy which they pre&s;cribe and a&s;&s;ign him? If he refu&s;es to li&s;ten to them, if he &s;hews him&s;elf an enemy to labour, can he ever advance or make any progre&s;s in the knowledge of their art? Is it not by con&s;tant imitation, by long and painful efforts, by daily a&s;&s;iduity, that he cea&s;es to be a &s;cholar, and commences a ma&s;ter? In a riper age, if he wi&s;hes to de|rive any advantage from the employment he follows, to exerci&s;e it with honour, and merit e&s;teem and confidence, &s;hould he not per&s;evere and double his labours; give proofs of his talents, capacity, emulation, patience, fidelity, and probity; and &s;urmount every difficulty annexed to his &s;ituation? If he is &s;ettled in life; if he is married; if he has a family; what new cares and endle&s;s trou|bles is he involved in? To pay the &s;ame at|tention to his children, which he him&s;elf has experienced from his parents; to feed them in their infancy; to protect them from a thou&s;and dangers which encompa&s;s and threaten them; to be attentive to all their nece&s;&s;aries; to procure them education;
<PB N="117" REF="030594_0116_0FE7F5FE2254E120">and to &s;ettle them in the world; all the&s;e are but a part of the duties which he has to perform on their account.</P>
<P>You are now going to mention what prevents you from following the practice of virtue, and attending to the care of your edu|cation; becau&s;e it is too painful and trouble|&s;ome a pur&s;uit. It is, you &s;ay, too laborious to acquire education? But do you not know, that &s;uch is the order of Providence in the di&s;pen&s;ation of all his gifts, that he does not grant us any of them without re|quiring a portion of labour from us in re|turn? The very bread we eat, ob&s;erve what a tedious proce&s;s it mu&s;t go through, to bring it to the &s;tate in which it becomes our food? Have you con&s;idered, that it is the fruit of the toils, the watchings, the pa|tience, and &s;weat of the labourer? Have you reflected on the changes and alterations it has undergone? This gold, this &s;ilver, which mankind in general are &s;o enamour|ed with, do you know rightly what it is? Have you pondered on it? Do you know that we mu&s;t enter the very bowels of the
<PB N="118" REF="030594_0117_0FE7F604AD387638">earth, and pierce into its deep and gloomy rece&s;&s;es, to &s;eek it? That thou&s;ands of our fellow-beings are deprived of the light of day, and in a manner buried alive, in the very womb of the earth, there to procure the&s;e metals, for which our exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t parches and con&s;umes us? Tho&s;e delicate di&s;hes, tho&s;e choice viands, which &s;ometimes crown the fe&s;tive board, do you know, that to obtain them, we mu&s;t traver&s;e the &s;eas to remote di&s;tances, in the mid&s;t of rocks and dangers the mo&s;t imminent? Tho&s;e &s;ilks with which we are &s;o fond of clothing and adorning our per&s;ons, are they not the &s;poil of worms, the mo&s;t contemptible in|fects?</P>
<P>I &s;hould exceed the limits of the&s;e pages, were I to analy&s;e all the wants of man, and the pains it co&s;ts him to &s;atisfy them. La|bour is the condition and appendage of our nature; and without this condition, you could not obtain any enjoyment. If you wi&s;h to have friends, you mu&s;t be in|tere&s;ted in their welfare, love them, and render them &s;ervice. If you mean to di&s;|tingui&s;h
<PB N="119" REF="030594_0118_0FE7F6064514CFD0">your&s;elf in the city you re&s;ide in, you mu&s;t become u&s;eful to your fellow-citi|zens. If you have an ambition to excel in your profe&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t give proofs of capacity, talents, and merit. If you are de&s;irous that the earth produce fruits, you mu&s;t cultivate it. If you propo&s;e to en|rich your&s;elf by commerce, you mu&s;t be ac|quainted with your bu&s;ine&s;s, be attentive, active, and per&s;evering. In &s;hort, any pro|fe&s;&s;ion you embrace, you cannot practice without trouble, toil, and difficulty. Would you &s;uppo&s;e, then, that virtue is the only good on earth to be acquired without ex|ertions? Virtue, which is the mo&s;t precious of all gifts, and infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es all other things? Could you then henceforth love it as much as it is amiable, by making it the object of your addre&s;&s;es, the end of your education, and your whole conduct!</P>
<P>Plutarch, in the portrait he draws of the true philo&s;opher, repre&s;ents him practi&s;ing virtue for its own &s;ake; and from the con|viction of his rea&s;on, placing it above the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all other advantages; &s;hewing
<PB N="120" REF="030594_0119_0FE7E927274636E8">his firm attachment to its principles, even in the &s;uppo&s;ition that he had lived in a country without prince or magi&s;trate to watch over the actions of men, or without laws to direct their conduct, and teach them to be ju&s;t, moderate, good, and tem|perate. Would to God that this picture were realized in you! That you would fol|low no other philo&s;ophy than that of a man truly religious, and truly virtuous! You would then, by practi&s;ing the works of vir|tue, enjoy that happine&s;s and tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings which are its fruit and its reward.</P>
