<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Each Briti&s;h Gho&s;t by thee depriv'd of Breath,</L>
<L>Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy Death.</L>
<BIBL>POPE's Homer.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>REFORM thy conduct, Monarch, or attend,</L>
<L>The doom denounc'd, by virtue's con&s;tant friend,</L>
<L>Heav'ns awful God, his mandate 'tis I bear,</L>
<L>And call on George's callous &s;oul to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reform thy conduct, or expect that Heav'n,</L>
<L>By whom thy delegated pow'r is giv'n,</L>
<L>Will rou&s;e in wrath, and hurl thee from the throne,</L>
<L>Unworthy Prince, whom Britons blu&s;h to own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See civil rage torment the bleeding land,</L>
<L>Rais'd and &s;upported by a Monarch's hand;</L>
<L>Permit me Prince, t'unfold the dreadful &s;cene,</L>
<L>And actions that di&s;grace the name of men,</L>
<L>See Briti&s;h legions reeking from the &s;word</L>
<L>Of worthle&s;s Britons, and their mi&s;led Lord,</L>
<L><PB N="222" REF="013993_0002_0F925926A9D6B568">
The orphan'd &s;on, the helple&s;s mother &s;ee,</L>
<L>Plung'd in the depths of awful mi&s;ery.</L>
<L>Youth and hoary age lie whelt'ring on the plains,</L>
<L>And de&s;olation and de&s;truction reigns:</L>
<L>Such &s;cenes as the&s;e mu&s;t &s;ure your &s;oul appall,</L>
<L>Thou art th' occa&s;ion, thou the cau&s;e of all;</L>
<L>What e'er thy cur&s;ed minions can de&s;ign,</L>
<L>Thou giv'&s;t a&s;&s;ent, and the whole guilt is thine;</L>
<L>See Britain wa&s;ted by her father's &s;word,</L>
<L>And France and ev'ry foreign aid implor'd;</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e they &s;hou'd be conquer'd, what remains,</L>
<L>What can be had from captives and from chains;</L>
<L>What large revenues can your coffers boa&s;t,</L>
<L>From ruin'd cities, and a wa&s;ted coa&s;t,</L>
<L>From nations &s;laughter'd, and from &s;eas of blood,</L>
<L>What gain to make the mighty mi&s;chief good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Remember Prince on what precarious ties,</L>
<L>The uncertain &s;afety of a tyrant lies;</L>
<L>What poor defence will guards and armies yield,</L>
<L>When long in&s;ulted &s;ubjects take the field;</L>
<L>What &s;afety then can para&s;ites be&s;tow,</L>
<L>Or how elude the long de&s;erved blow;</L>
<L>When ju&s;tice ri&s;es and demands the blood</L>
<L>Of haughty tyrants, and their fawning crowd;</L>
<L>Ah, blu&s;h, deluded Prince, with comcious &s;hame</L>
<L>That George &s;hould merit that dete&s;ted name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search Briti&s;h annals, and let them declare,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e truths too har&s;h to wound the royal ear;</L>
<L>See brave Fitzwalter lead the Barons on,</L>
<L>And force the unwilling deed from coward John;</L>
<L>With iron &s;way the blu&s;t'ring da&s;tard rules,</L>
<L>The con&s;tant dupe of &s;warming knaves and fools.</L>
<L>"The weake&s;t Athie&s;t wretch all Heav'n defies,</L>
<L>Who &s;hrinks and &s;hudders when the thunder flies."</L>
<L><PB N="223" REF="013993_0003_0F925927D0A45870">
So &s;hrunk the tyrant, when Fitzwalter led,</L>
<L>His warlike cohorts on to Runny Mead,</L>
<L>Then ancient Wind&s;or's lofty towr's beheld,</L>
<L>The blazing &s;tandards waving o'er the field,</L>
<L>The &s;hining jav'lins glittering from afar,</L>
<L>The moony &s;hields and all the pomp of war;</L>
<L>Sheath'd in bright &s;teel then Britains &s;aviours &s;tood,</L>
<L>Undaunted, firm, and re&s;olutely good;</L>
<L>Forth in the mid&s;t the frowning tyrant came,</L>
<L>And viewed with fear and rage each godlike name.</L>
<L>The coward &s;hrunk at Britain's brave array,</L>
<L>And Magna Charta crown'd the glorious day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search further yet how Edward's minions fell,</L>
<L>That galling truth, to Bute and Mansfield tell.</L>
<L>May every cur&s;e, vindictive heaven can pour,</L>
<L>De&s;cend on them, in one de&s;tructive &s;hower,</L>
<L>Peri&s;h their names O! let the traitors bleed;</L>
<L>Ju&s;tice demands, the realm approves the deed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceed and be by faithful hi&s;t'ry taught,</L>
<L>How E&s;&s;ex labour'd, and great Cromwell fought;</L>
<L>When haughty Charles di&s;grac'd the Briti&s;h throne,</L>
<L>And trod our freedom and religion down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That dreadful Cri&s;is big with loud alarms,</L>
<L>Call'd every Briton to a&s;&s;ert in arms</L>
<L>The dear bought rights, the violated cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Of their dear country and its &s;acred laws;</L>
<L>They came obedient to the glorious call,</L>
<L>One generous &s;pirit animated all:</L>
<L>Such generous &s;ouls may Britain yet afford,</L>
<L>And own again a Cromwell's &s;aving &s;word;</L>
<L>An Hampden yet, an E&s;&s;ex yet may ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And tyrants yet may fall a &s;acrifice.</L>
<L>Illu&s;trious &s;hades the faithful mu&s;e &s;hall crown,</L>
<L>Your glorious names, with honour and renown,</L>
<L><PB N="224" REF="013993_0004_0F92592824AF01A8">
Long as this world with all its &s;plendor &s;tands,</L>
<L>Stupendeous frame, rais'd by immortal hands.</L>
<L>Long as the annals of eternal fame,</L>
<L>Record each hero's and each patriot's name,</L>
<L>Long as a Briton lives t' a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Of heaven, of freedom, and the Briti&s;h laws;</L>
<L>So long &s;hall Cromwell's, Hampden's name remain</L>
<L>And times era&s;ing vengeance prove in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In&s;pire your children, O ye patriot band,</L>
<L>To ru&s;h on death, and &s;ave a &s;inking land;</L>
<L>You who could haughty tyranny repel,</L>
<L>Protect the cau&s;e, in which you nobly fell,</L>
<L>That glorious cau&s;e, which heaven eternal owns,</L>
<L>And fires to vengeance your too tardy &s;ons:</L>
<L>They ri&s;e at length, t' a&s;&s;ert the freedom given,</L>
<L>T' a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e of liberty and heaven;</L>
<L>Tremble thou tyrant at the awful day,</L>
<L>When injur'd Britons give their vengeance way;</L>
<L>Tremble ye minions who your Prince mi&s;led,</L>
<L>Uncommon wrath remains for you to dread,</L>
<L>The traytors who your &s;overeign's heart have &s;teel&punc;</L>
<L>And cur'&s;t him with a &s;oul that cannot yield,</L>
<L>Eternal vengeance mu&s;t your crimes pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Ju&s;tice demands you, as the public due.</L>
<L>Un&s;eeling man, if e'er thy &s;oul can know,</L>
<L>Steel'd as it is, the touch of human woe;</L>
<L>If generous pity can a thought impart,</L>
<L>To &s;hake the horrid purpo&s;e of your heart,</L>
<L>If pity harbours in that iron brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Call back your cut-throats, give your people re&s;t;</L>
<L>Withdraw your fleets, &s;end no more armies o'er,</L>
<L>But bid the martial thunders cea&s;e to roar.</L>
<L>Do this, and Britain may again forgive,</L>
<L>Again con&s;ent to let a tyrant live.</L>

<L>But dare not trifle with a moment given,</L>
<L>Pre&s;umptous Prince, nor &s;purn with awful heaven,</L>
<L>Think not that Britons pa&s;&s;ive will remain,</L>
<L>Hug the vile yoke, and &s;mile upon the chain;</L>
<L>They have not learnt the faith which cowards own,</L>
<L>"The enormous faith of many made for one,"</L>
<L>Far nobler precepts fire the Briti&s;h brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Then yielding freedom for inglorious re&s;t;</L>
<L>Far nobler ends their freeborn &s;pirits own,</L>
<L>Then ba&s;ely crouching to a tyrants throne;</L>
<L>Such ba&s;e conce&s;&s;ions &s;tain'd not Britain's fame,</L>
<L>When Charles's death immortaliz'd their name&punc;</L>
<L>Or guilty James his injur'd &s;ubjects fled,</L>
