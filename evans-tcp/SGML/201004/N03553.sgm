<HEAD>To the Honourable <HI>William Coddington,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is not barely to give you a publick Te&s;timony of my Gratitude for ma|ny per&s;onal Favours, nor yet of that E&s;teem and Re|&s;pect which all Men bear you, for your &s;ingular Equi|ty and Benevolence, not on|ly
<PB N="2" REF="004347_0003_1004420649E36328">in private Life, but in all the various Offices, in which you have &s;erved and adorned your Country; that I prefix your Name to the&s;e Papers: But becau&s;e an Attempt to re|cover &s;ome Account of this happy I&s;land, and to make a re|ligious Improvement of the merciful Providences of God towards it, is ju&s;tly due to the lineal Repre&s;entative of that worthy Gentleman, who was the great In&s;trument of it's original Settlement.</P>
<P>Your honoured Grandfa|ther <HI>William Coddington,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was cho&s;en in <HI>England</HI> to be
<PB N="3" REF="004347_0004_10044A2F8800A908">an <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tant</HI> of the Colony of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, A. D.</HI> 1629, and in 1630 came o|ver to <HI>New-England</HI> with the Governour and the Charter, &amp;c. after which he was &s;eve|ral Times recho&s;en to that honourable and important Office. He was for &s;ome Time Trea&s;urer of the Colo|ny. He was with the Chief|e&s;t in all publick Charges, 'and a principal Merchant in <HI>Bo&s;ton',</HI> where he built the fir&s;t Brick Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Year 1637, when the Contentions ran &s;o high in the Country, he was grieved
<PB N="4" REF="004347_0005_1004425899650D88">at the Proceedings of the Court, again&s;t Mr. <HI>Wheel|wright</HI> and Others. And when he found that his Op|po&s;itions to tho&s;e Mea&s;ures was ineffectual, he entred his Prote&s;t, 'that his Di&s;&s;ent might appear to &s;ucceeding Times'; and though he was in the faire&s;t Way to be Great, in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> as to outward Things, yet he voluntarily quitted his Ad|vantageous Situation at <HI>Boston,</HI> his large Propriety and Im|provements at <HI>Braintree,</HI> for Peace &s;ake, and that he might befriend, protect, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the pious People, who were
<PB N="5" REF="004347_0006_10044A33F2809E90">meditating a Removal from that Colony, on account of their religious Differences.</P>
<P>Here when the People fir&s;t incorporated them|&s;elves a Body politick on this I&s;land, they cho&s;e him to be their Judge or chief Ruler, and continued to elect him annually to be their Gover|nour for &s;even Years toge|ther, 'till the Patent took Place, and the I&s;land was in|corporated with <HI>Providence-Plantations.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1647, he a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in forming the Body
<PB N="6" REF="004347_0007_100449C9675B5140">of Laws, which has been the Ba&s;is of our Con&s;titution and Government ever &s;ince; and the next Year being cho&s;en Governour of the Colony, declined the Of|fice.</P>
<P>In 1651, he had a Com|mi&s;&s;ion from the &s;upream Authority then in <HI>England,</HI> to be Governour of the I&s;|land, pur&s;uant to a Power re&s;erved in the <HI>Patent:</HI> But the People being jealous 'the Commi&s;&s;ion might af|fect their Lands and Liber|ties as &s;eemed to them by the Patent', he readily laid
<PB N="7" REF="004347_0008_10044A3B12BCBCD8">it down on the fir&s;t Notice from <HI>England</HI> that he might do &s;o; &amp; for their further Sa|tisfaction and Contentment, he, by a Writing under his Hand, obliged him&s;elf to make a formal Surrender of all Right and Title to any of the Lands, more than his Pro|portion in common with the other Inhabitants, whenever it &s;hould be demanded.</P>
<P>After that he &s;eems to have retired much from publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, till toward the latter End of his Days, when he was again divers Times prevailed with to take the Government upon him; as he did particu|larly
<PB N="8" REF="004347_0009_10044204C4762E70">1678, when he died <HI>Nov.</HI> 1. in the 78th Year of his Age, <HI>a good Man full of Days.</HI> Thus after he had the Honour to be the fir&s;t Judge and Governour of this I&s;land, 'after he had &s;pent much of his E&s;tate and the Prime of his Life in propa|gating Plantations', he died Governour of the Colony&mdash; in promoting the Welfare and the Pro&s;perity of the lit|tle Common-Wealth, which he had in a manner founded.</P>
<P>If there was any Oppo&s;ition at any Time to any of his Mea|&s;ures, or if he met with any in grateful Returns from any he had &s;erved, it was no more
<PB N="9" REF="004347_0010_10044A40A02E3478">than what &s;everal of the other fir&s;t excellent Governours of the other <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lonies met with, from a People made froward by the Circum|&s;tances of a Wilderne&s;s, and over jealous of their Privi|ledges. A free People will always be jealous of their Priviledges, and Hi&s;tory a|bounds with Examples of the Mi&s;takes and Ingratitude oc|ca&s;ioned by that Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>If the following Di&s;cour&s;e has done any Ju&s;tice to the Memory and Character of the pious People who fir&s;t &s;etled this Colony, or if it has any Tendency to promote
<PB N="10" REF="004347_0011_100449D05265DE90">the true original Ends of this Plantation, I am &s;ure of your Patronage. And as to what relates to &s;ome Articles, dif|ferent from your Judgment and Practice in religious Mat|ters, the Genero&s;ity and Can|dour you inherit from your great Ance&s;tors, will ea&s;ily bear with me, endeavouring to vindicate my own Opini|ons on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I hope there are few or no Errors in the Matters of Fact related, or the Dates that are a&s;&s;igned; to prevent any Mi&s;takes, I have carefully re|viewed the publick Records, and my other Materials; this
<PB N="11" REF="004347_0012_1004427562CAC0E8">Review has bro't to my Know|ledge or Remembrance many Things, that were not menti|oned in the Pulpit, which however it &s;eemed ought not to be omitted.</P>
<P>I de&s;igned to have put all the Additions and Enlarge|ments, in the Form of Notes for my own Ea&s;e, but have been per&s;waded to weave as many of them as were pro|per into the Body of the Di&s;cour&s;e, as what is general|ly mo&s;t plea&s;ing to the Rea|der. I am very &s;en&s;ible, &s;e|veral Things will be tho't too minute or per&s;onal by Stran|gers, but the De&s;cendents of
<PB N="12" REF="004347_0013_1004420F18A284C0">the Per&s;ons concerned, and the Inhabitants of the Colony, will readily pardon me. And &s;ome other Things which are familiarly known among our &s;elves, will be nece&s;&s;ary to Others.</P>
<P>It is much to be lamented that many valuable Manu|&s;cripts of &s;ome of the fir&s;t Set|lers here, are &s;o &s;oon embez|led and lo&s;t. And it is much to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome Gen|tlemen of Ingenuity and Lei|&s;ure, would take Pains to col|lect as many of the&s;e old Papers as can be found di&s;per&s;ed a|bout. I am apt to think, that the&s;e, with the publick
<PB N="13" REF="004347_0014_10044A4511F56980">Records, would furni&s;h Ma|terials for a <HI>just Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Colony.</HI></P>
<P>What is here pre&s;ented to your View, will by no Means &s;uper&s;ede &s;uch a De&s;ign; I rather hope it will &s;timulate Gentlemen in every Part of the Colony, to make a Search after &s;uch Papers, and more e&s;pecially <HI>now,</HI> while the <HI>New-England Chronology</HI> is in Hand, compo&s;ing by a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> above all Exceptions univer|&s;ally acknowledged the be&s;t ver&s;ed in the Hi&s;tory of the Country, and the mo&s;t ca|pable to give the World a ju&s;t and clear Idea of all our

The <HI>Pope</HI> &s;oon after, generou&s;ly be&s;towed the <HI>new World,</HI> on the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they made many <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;sful Voyages,</HI> and many great <HI>Conque&s;ts and Settlements in the &s;outhern Parts of the new found World.</HI> Their Succe&s;s, and the immen&s;e Riches,
<PB N="4" REF="004347_0019_100449E16750BE38">they carried home to <HI>Europe,</HI> did in Proce&s;s of Time, excite other Nations, to put in for a Share with them. Among the re&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (who had narrowly mi&s;t the Advantages of the <HI>fir&s;t Di&s;covery</HI>) be&s;ides their Enterprizes on the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> made many &s;ucce&s;s&s;ive Attempts, to di&s;|cover and &s;ettle in <HI>North-America.</HI></P>
<P>In 1578 or 1579, there was a Patent granted by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for &s;ix Years to Sir <HI>H. Gil|bert,</HI> to plant, and inhabit &s;ome northern Parts of <HI>America,</HI> unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any Prince, with whom &s;he had any Alliance.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 25. 1584, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted to Sir <HI>W. Raleigh</HI> a Patent for foreign Parts not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tian Prince. And the &s;ame Year, he took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country, to the we&s;tward of <HI>Roanoke,</HI> and called it <HI>Virginia,</HI> in Honour of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. He &s;ent three &s;everal Colonies, to &s;ettle in tho&s;e Parts, who all failed. As did Capt. <HI>Go&s;nold</HI> in a like Attempt, to &s;et|tle, in what, is &s;ince called <HI>New-England,</HI> which he fir&s;t di&s;covered in 1602. And &s;everal other Attempts met with the like ill Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 10 1606, King <HI>James</HI> divided <HI>Virginia</HI> into two Colonies, which were called South and North, the fir&s;t between 34 and 41 Degrees North, and the la&s;t between 38 and 45, and they were
<PB N="5" REF="004347_0020_10044A50CE3FCBF0">not to &s;ettle, within an hundred Miles of one another. By 1611 the <HI>&s;outhern or</HI> London <HI>Com|pany,</HI> had made an effectual Settlement; while the <HI>northern or</HI> Plymouth <HI>Company</HI> were almo&s;t di&s;couraged at their repeated Di&s;appointments. However Judge <HI>Popham,</HI> Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> and others, continued their Attempts, and their De&s;igns, till <HI>divine Providence</HI> began a Settlement, within their Juri&s;diction, without their Know|ledge or Contrivance.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged on all Hands, the <HI>fir&s;t Set|tlements of New-England,</HI> were a Con&s;equence of the Di&s;putes, which attended the Reformation in <HI>England;</HI> and therefore we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that during this Time, <HI>viz.</HI> 1517, Learning ha|ving revived all over <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Reformation</HI> was begun by <HI>Luther,</HI> and others in <HI>Germany,</HI> and carried on in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> particularly in <HI>England,</HI> where, after a long Struggle, it was finally e&s;tabli&s;hed, by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> under Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who began to reign <HI>November</HI> 17. 1558.</P>
<P>As the <HI>whole Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> had been cor|rupted, and disfigured by the Inventions and Im|po&s;itions of Popery, in a long Cour&s;e of Time, it is &s;o far from being to be wondered at, that it could not, but be expected, that many, who were ju&s;tly and equally offended, at the horrid
<PB N="6" REF="004347_0021_100449E71F954808">Corruptions of Popery, &s;hould yet be unable, entirely to agree in their Sentiments, of what Things were to be reformed, or how far, they &s;hould carry the Reformation at the fir&s;t. And yet this, was every where, a great and unhappy <HI>Remora</HI> to that glorious Work, and gave their Enemies, a very con&s;iderable Advantage, which they well knew how, and failed not to im|prove to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Effects of the&s;e Divi&s;ions, and the Ani|mo&s;ities with which they were maintained, were felt in <HI>England,</HI> not only, in the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> but after it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and even ever &s;ince to this Day. Among the Re|formers in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign (many of whom had been Exiles in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Per&s;e|cution, and &s;o had more Opportunity, to &s;ee and conver&s;e with the foreign Prote&s;tants) there were many, who &s;ought to carry the Reformati|on, farther in &s;ome Points, than had been done in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Time. They &s;ought to take away every Thing, they imagined, had the Co|lour of Super&s;tition, and to make the Bible their real Rule in Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline, as well as in Faith. The&s;e were pre&s;ently called <HI>Puritans,</HI> as pretending to &s;eek a purer Church State, and a farther Reformation, than the other Party, tho't was nece&s;&s;ary or expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004347_0022_10044A54F9FA73F8">
<HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> had not the &s;ame Exceptions, to many Things the <HI>Puritans</HI> &s;crupled; and be&s;ide, tho't it was but good Policy, to make as few, and as little Changes and Alterations, as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;peci|ally in the Ceremonies, which mo&s;t powerfully affect the Vulgar, in order to draw in the Bulk of the Clergy, and the Nation, to favour the o|ther Alterations, which all of them e&s;teemed to be, of the mo&s;t Importance. And the <HI>Queen</HI> zealou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ing this Party, turned the Bal|lance in their Favour, and accordingly for &s;ome Years, the whole Nation, in Effect, came to Church, tho' the Times were far from being &s;etled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Puritans,</HI> it &s;eems, had few or no Ob|jections, to <HI>the Articles of Faith,</HI> but they chief|ly, objected again&s;t the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> the <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI> But however, they were not perfectly agreed among them|&s;elves; while the much larger Part of them, Fa|thers of tho&s;e &s;ince called <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> generally &s;trove to keep their Places in the Church, without <HI>conforming</HI> to &s;ome of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive Ceremo|nies, and by voluntary Agreement among them|&s;elves, &s;ought to remedy, and &s;upply what they tho't, was ami&s;s or wanting, in the <HI>parliamentary E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> others of them, Fathers of tho&s;e &s;ince called <HI>Independents</HI> and <HI>Congregationali&s;ts,</HI> &s;eparated wholly from the publick Wor&s;hip, in
<PB N="8" REF="004347_0023_100449EC6C98AFE0">the Pari&s;h Churches, and &s;ought a thorough Al|teration, in the whole Form and Con&s;titution of the <HI>Church,</HI> and to lay a&s;ide the Liturgy, and all the Ceremonies together.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> kept a watchful and jealous Eye over them all, as fearing, and being deter|mined again&s;t all farther Alterations in religious Matters. And Sub&s;cription and Conformity, being at Times pre&s;&s;ed harder, as the Friends to the Puritans were out of Power, &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e called <HI>Seperati&s;ts,</HI> had been driven out of <HI>England,</HI> and at Length there was a Church of the <HI>Independent Scheme,</HI> formed at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> In the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> (whom the <HI>Puritans</HI> expected, to be a Patron to them, as he had been educated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had openly cen&s;ured the <HI>Church of England</HI>) tho&s;e Things which offended them, were carried with an higher Hand. In the Years 1608 and 1609, &s;everal more of them in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> removed to <HI>Holland,</HI> and a Number of them &s;ettled at <HI>Leyden</HI> under the <HI>pa&s;toral Care of</HI> Mr. <HI>John Robin&s;on</HI> (afterwards <HI>the Father of</HI> Plymouth <HI>Colony</HI>) in hopes, to enjoy that <HI>Liber|ty of their Con&s;ciences,</HI> in a &s;trange Land, they were denied at Home.</P>
<P>Here they continued <HI>eleven or twelve Years,</HI> 'till, for many Rea&s;ons, they began to meditate
<PB N="9" REF="004347_0024_1004427F9749BB20">a Removal, and cho&s;e to &s;eek an <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> &s;ome|where in <HI>North-America</HI> near <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River. They had a long and tedious Treaty, with the Sou|thern or <HI>Virginia Company,</HI> who might rea&s;onably expect, greater Sobriety, Patience, and Indu&s;try, from a People of &s;uch a Character, and in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, and who had &s;uch Views and De&s;igns of their own, than they had found, in &s;uch other People, as they could prevail on, to tran&s;port them|&s;elves into a Wilderne&s;s. However the Factions and Di&s;turbances in the Company, and other Cau&s;es, delay'd the Affairs for &s;ome Time, 'till 1619, in the <HI>Fall,</HI> they obtain'd a Patent for the Land, but they could not obtain a legal A&s;&s;u|rance of the Liberty of their Con&s;ciences. How|ever they determin'd at length to remove, de|pending on &s;ome general Promi&s;es of Connivance, if they behaved them&s;elves peaceably, and hoping that the Di&s;tance, and remotene&s;s of the Place, as well as the <HI>publick Service,</HI> they &s;hould do the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom,</HI> would prevent their being di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>After encountring many Difficulties, and Di&s;|couragements, from the Nature and Circum&s;tan|ces of their Voyage, and from the Treachery of &s;ome of the Undertakers, they arrived at <HI>Cape Cod</HI> on the 9th of <HI>November</HI> 1620. Here they found their <HI>Patent u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> this Place being within
<PB N="10" REF="004347_0025_100442215612DD18">the Bounds of the <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>Plymouth Com|pany;</HI> and yet Nece&s;&s;ity obliged them to &s;et down thereabout. They did therefore two Days after <HI>incorporate them&s;elves a Body politick,</HI> and having made &s;uch a Search of the adjacent Country, as their Circum&s;tances would allow, at that Time of the Year, they began their Settle|ment, about Chri&s;tma&s;s, at a Place, called by the <HI>Indians, Patuxet,</HI> by them named <HI>New-Ply|mouth.</HI> Infinite almo&s;t were the Hard&s;hips, and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the en&s;uing Winter, in which near half the Company died, for want of Nece&s;&s;aries. However through <HI>the merciful Providence of GOD</HI> they maintained their Ground, and through many Difficulties, which they overcame by Patience and the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, they encrea&s;ed to <HI>three hundred Souls</HI> in <HI>nine</HI> Years after, when they ob|tained a <HI>Patent,</HI> from the <HI>New-England Company</HI> the 13th of <HI>January,</HI> 1629, 30.</P>
<P>In that Period, there had been many &s;ucce&s;s|le&s;s Attempts, to make Settlements in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> for the &s;ake of <HI>Trade and Husbandry only,</HI> as if divine Providence had re&s;erved the Place for tho&s;e who &s;oon after took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The Succe&s;s of the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Planters began to excite the <HI>Puritans,</HI> all over <HI>England,</HI> to medi|tate a Removal, to tho&s;e Parts of the World, in order to enjoy the Liberty of wor&s;hipping GOD according to their Con&s;ciences.

This is certain, the &s;ame Principles in &s;ome Per&s;ons, which had rendred their Stay, unea&s;y at Home, and which refu&s;ed them a legal Toleration, in the Wilds of <HI>America,</HI> made their leaving the Kingdom, as difficult as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>In Reality the <HI>true Grounds of Liberty of Con|&s;cience,</HI> were not then known, or embraced by a|ny Sect or Party of Chri&s;tians; all Parties &s;eem|ed to think, that as <HI>they only</HI> were in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the Truth, &s;o <HI>they alone</HI> had a Right to re&s;train, and cru&s;h all other Opinions, which they re&s;pectively called Error, and Here&s;y, where they were the mo&s;t numerous, and powerful; and in other Places <HI>they</HI> pleaded a Title, to Liberty and Freedom of their Con&s;ciences.

I take it to have been no Di&s;honour to the Co|lony, that Chri&s;tians, of every Denomination, were &s;uffered to lead quiet and peaceable Lives, without any Fines, or Puni&s;hments for their &s;pe|culative Opinions, or for u&s;ing tho&s;e external Forms of Wor&s;hip, they believed GOD had ap|pointed, and would accept. Bigots may call this Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;order, and it may be &s;o, according to their poor worldly Notions of Re|ligion, and the Kingdom of Chri&s;t. But the pre|tended Order of humane Authority, a&s;&s;uming the Place and Prerogatives of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and tram|pling on the Con&s;ciences of his Subjects, is, as Mr. <HI>R.

<P>Tho' it be very certain, that a publick Wor&s;hip of GOD, is very nece&s;&s;ary even to civilize Mankind, who would be likely to loo&s;e all Sen&s;e of Religi|on without it; yet it will not follow, that the ci|vil Magi&s;trate, as &s;uch, has Authority to appoint the Rites of Wor&s;hip, and con&s;train all his Sub|jects to u&s;e them, much le&s;s to puni&s;h them for u&s;ing any other. What has been forever the Con&s;equences, of his pretending to &s;uch Authori|ty, and u&s;ing his Power to &s;upport it? What Glory doth it bring to GOD, and what Good can it do to Men, to force them to attend a Wor|&s;hip they di&s;approve? It can only make them Hypocrites, and GOD abhors &s;uch Wor&s;hippers.</P>

<P>It is no ways unlikely, &s;ome odd, and whim&s;i|cal Opinions may have been broached, the Li|berty enjoyed here, would tempt Per&s;ons di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed for their Opinions in the neighbouring Go|vernments, to retire to this Colony as an A&s;ylum.

<P>I do not pretend to defend all the Opinions, that were entertained by any of them; much le&s;s all the extravagant Notions, that were un|ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to &s;ome of them; nor yet to ju&s;|tify every Word, or Action, that might be the Effect of heated Zeal, or rai&s;ed Indignation and Re&s;entment.

If there were any of them, who made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con|&s;cience, perhaps it would be as ea&s;y, as it would be invidious, to find Parallels enough in other Places, to &s;hew there are other dangerous Rocks, be&s;ides Liberty of Con&s;cience. It is an unac|countable Humour, that has prevailed among too many chri&s;tian Sects, to make Religion, and the Go&s;pel con&s;i&s;t, in their own peculiar and di&s;|tingui&s;hing Tenets, which would almo&s;t tempt an impartial Man, to think it ought rather to con&s;i&s;t, in tho&s;e Things, wherein they are mo&s;t generally agreed, and conclude in the Words of the excellent Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> <Q>The Period ha&s;tens for <HI>a new Reformation,</HI> wherein 'tis likely none of <HI>our very be&s;t Parties,</HI> will be in all Things, the Standard of what &s;hall prevail in the World, but our holy Lord will form a new People, of tho&s;e good Men that &s;hall u|nite

<P>It mu&s;t be a mean contracted Way of thinking, to confine the Favour of GOD, and the Power of Godline&s;s, to one Set of &s;peculative Opinions, or any particular external Forms of Wor&s;hip.

It would be hard to &s;hew, why Liberty of Con&s;cience, mutual For|bearance, and Good Will, why brotherly Kind|ne&s;s and Charity, is not as good a Center of Uni|ty, as a con&s;train'd Uniformity in external Ce|remonies, or a forced Sub&s;cription to ambiguous Articles.

<P>But to return, about the Year 1653 or 54, there was a Divi&s;ion in the <HI>Bapti&s;t Church,</HI> at <HI>Providence, about the Rite of laying on of Hands,</HI> which &s;ome pleaded for as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to Church-Communion, and the others would leave indiffe|rent.

<P>It is remarkable, that the Principles <HI>of a too rigid Separation,</HI> planted by Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> have taken a deep Root, while &s;ome other of his dar|ling Opinions are almo&s;t withered away.

<P>This Church &s;hot out into divers Branches, as the Members increa&s;ed, and the Di&s;tance of their Habitations made it inconvenient to attend the publick Wor&s;hip in the Town; &s;everal Meetings
<PB N="62" REF="004347_0077_10044B5895E88D10">were thereupon fixed at different Places, for their Ea&s;e and Accommodation; and about this Time the large Town&s;hip of <HI>Providence</HI> became divided into <HI>four Towns:</HI> their <HI>Chapels of Ea&s;e,</HI> began to be con&s;idered as di&s;tinct Churches, tho' all are yet in a Union of Councils and Intere&s;ts: And there is a &s;trict A&s;&s;ociation, of all the Bapti&s;t Churches in <HI>New England,</HI> that hold the Doctrine of <HI>laying on of Hands, in that Sen&s;e,</HI> maintained, by yearly Meetings of the Elders and Brethren, at &s;everal Places, from time to time, where the Affairs of all the Churches are con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The People who came to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> who were Puritans of the highe&s;t Form, had de&s;ired and depended on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> a famous Congregational Mini&s;ter aforementioned.

<P>It is &s;aid, that in 1644, Mr. <HI>John Clark,</HI> and &s;ome others, formed a Church, on the Scheme and Principles of <HI>the Bapti&s;ts.</HI> It is certain that in 1648 there were fifteen Members in full Commu|nion<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Names of the Males were <HI>John Clark, Mark Lukar, Nathanael We&s;t, Wm.

In the Year 1637, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with united Forces &s;ubdued the <HI>Pequots,</HI> who had attacked their Brethren in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> the <HI>Narragan&s;etts,</HI> who bordered on the <HI>Pequot</HI>'s Land, con&s;ented and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their De&s;truction, thro' a De&s;ire of Revenge, which is remarkable in all the Sa|vages, tho' their <HI>old Sachems</HI> de&s;ired to have pre&s;erved Peace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nantyggan&s;iks,</HI> or <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> inhabited the Lands, or governed over all the <HI>Indians</HI> within the Bounds of this Colony.

The Indians in this Part of <HI>America,</HI> appear to have been &s;ome of the lea&s;t improved, of the <HI>humane Species,</HI> without any Learning, or Know|ledge in any of the politer Arts of Life, even without <HI>Iron</HI> and the Improvements which depend on that. The &s;trange De&s;truction of this People, now &s;ince the Wars cea&s;ed, and within Memory, is very remarkable. Their in&s;uperable Aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h indu&s;try, and Way of Life, the Alteration from the <HI>Indian</HI> Method of living, their <HI>Lazine&s;s,</HI> and their <HI>univer&s;al Love of Strong Drink,</HI> have &s;wept them away, in a wonderful Manner.

<P>And this brings me now at la&s;t, to the RE|MARKS I promi&s;ed at the Beginning. And</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, <HI>The wonderful and un&s;earchable Providence of GOD, in the whole Affair,</HI> of <HI>driving out the Natives, and planting Colonies of Europeans, and Churches of Chri&s;tians, in the Place of Heathe|ni&s;m and Barbarity.</HI></P>
<P>I pretend not to have known the Mind of the LORD, or to have been his Coun&s;eller, or to be able to comprehend, the Ways of divine Provi|dence. GOD's Judgments are a great Deep;
<PB N="89" REF="004347_0104_1004435B8C5691C0">but we mu&s;t be wilfully blind, if we cannot &s;ee, <HI>that the Hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;covery, and the Conque&s;t of AMERICA, with the amazing De&s;olations wrought therein, appear a more remarkable Event, than a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> other in all prophane Hi&s;tory, &s;ince the univer&s;al De|luge.

If we believe a Pro|vidence (and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible we can believe none) we mu&s;t needs think it concerned, in the Pre&s;er|vation, and the Puni&s;hment of Kingdoms, and Nations; and that the&s;e Parts of the World, tho' &s;eperated, hid, and unknown to the re&s;t, are yet as near the Omnipre&s;ence of GOD, and as much under his Government, as any other. And there|fore we &s;hould take Notice of the wonderful Provi|dence of GOD, in this great Affair. How &s;hould we learn to &s;ubmit our little per&s;onal Affairs, to the divine Providence, when we &s;ee that Nations, before Him, are but as the &s;mall Du&s;t of the Ballance? And how ju&s;tly may we &s;ay, <HI>Great and marvellous

The mo&s;t High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, and giveth them to whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>the Settlement of New England in parti|cular,</HI> was evidently providential, in <HI>many Re&s;pects.</HI> I have mentioned often the prevailing Mo|tive with the People, who came fir&s;t to plant and inhabit in this Wilderne&s;s; but the Difficulties and Di&s;couragements in their Way, were really many and very great; &s;o that who|ever reflects the lea&s;t upon them, <Q>mu&s;t wonder &s;o many were carried out from a flouri&s;hing State, to a Wilderne&s;s &s;o far di&s;tant; for (as One of them, Mr. <HI>Shepherd</HI> of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> his Life in the <HI>Magnalia;</HI> &s;ays) "they were not all of them ra&s;h and weak &s;pirited Per&s;ons, incon|&s;iderate of what they left behind, and were going to. It was not Gain, or Riches they aimed at. When we look back (&s;ays he) and con&s;ider, what a &s;trange Poi&s;e of Spirit, God had laid on many of our Hearts, we cannot but wonder at our &s;elves, that &s;o many, and &s;ome &s;o weak and tender, with &s;uch Chearfulne&s;s, and con&s;tant Re&s;olution, again&s;t &s;o many Per|&s;wa&s;ions of Friends, &amp; Di&s;couragements from

<P>Moreover, as the&s;e People came not here, for Plunder, which drew over the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the Southward, neither did they &s;ettle them&s;elves <HI>by Force or by their own Might;</HI> but GOD was plea&s;ed to make ready a Place prepared as an A&s;ylum for them: And &s;ince he has wonderfully driven out and con&s;umed <HI>the Natives</HI> by his de|vouring Judgments, their Sins have proved their Puni&s;hment; and their dete&s;table Vices, have drawn on tho&s;e mortal Sickne&s;&s;es, which have wa&s;ted away all within the Engli&s;h Pale, but a few embraced <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> or who by &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Engli&s;h Power,</HI> remains the Memorials of the&s;e wonderful Events.

<P>Again, 'tis remarkable how divine Providence was plea&s;ed to &s;upply their Wants in a Wilder|ne&s;s, among a People that never took care for the Morrow; and to &s;upport them under the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es they were tried with.

<P>It is no Plea&s;ure to any real Chri&s;tian, to &s;ee his Brethren, the Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST, &s;o divided as they are thro' the World, in their Opinions of various Articles, of his Religion; and much le&s;s, to &s;ee them &s;o divided in their Affections.

Let us pray the Father of Lights, and the Lord of the Harve&s;t, to revive and pro&s;per his Work in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Years.
