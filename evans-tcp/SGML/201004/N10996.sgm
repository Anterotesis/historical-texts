<P>THE &s;teady and uniform per&s;everance in a regular plan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">e&s;poti&s;m, &s;ince the commencement of this reign, makes it evident to the meane&s;t capacity, that a de&s;ign was formed (and it has with too much &s;ucce&s;s been carried into execution) for &s;ubverting the religion, laws, and con&s;titution of this kingdom, and to e&s;tabli&s;h, upon the ruins of public liberty, an arbitrary &s;y&s;tem of government. In a word, the de&s;truction of this kingdom will &s;oon be effected by a Prince of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>The bloody re&s;olution has pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Hou&s;e of Lords to ad|dre&s;s our pre&s;ent humane, gentle Sovereign, to give directions for enforcing the cruel and unju&s;t edicts of the la&s;t Parliament again&s;t the
<PB N="26" REF="013927_0002_0F925772C13B3F20">Americans. His Maje&s;ty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing prin|ciples which nothing can equal but the good|ne&s;s of his heart, will, no doubt, give imme|diate orders for carrying effectually into exe|cution the ma&s;&s;acre in America; e&s;pecially as he is to be &s;upported in polluting the earth with blood, with the lives and fortunes of his faithful butchers, the Lords and Commons; would to God they only were to fall a &s;acri|fice in this unnatural civil war.</P>
<P>The day of trial is at hand; it is time to prove the virtue, and rou&s;e the &s;pirit of the people of England; the pro&s;pect is too dread|ful, it is too melancholy to admit of farther delay.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of London ought imme|diately to call a common hall for the purpo&s;e of taking the &s;en&s;e of his fellow citizens, at this alarming cri&s;is, upon pre&s;enting a re|mon&s;trance to the throne, couched in terms that might do honor to the city, as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful in the world, and to them as men determined to be free; in terms that might &s;trike conviction into his Maje&s;ty's brea&s;t, and terror into the &s;ouls of his mi|nions. This is not a time for compliments, nor &s;hould tyrants, or the in&s;truments of ty|ranny, ever be complimented.</P>
<P>The merchants of London, it is to be hoped, and the whole commercial intere&s;t of England, will exert them&s;elves upon this great occa&s;ion, by &s;ending to the throne &s;pirit|ed and pointed remon&s;trances, worthy of Eng|li&s;hmen;
<PB N="27" REF="013927_0003_0F92577389CC3978">by noble and generous &s;ub&s;criptions, and in every other manner give all the relief, and all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, to their oppre&s;&s;ed and injured fellow &s;ubjects in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>Let them heartily join the Americans, and &s;ee whether tyranny and lawle&s;s power, or rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, heaven, truth, and liberty, will prevail.</P>
<P>Let them, together with the gentlemen of landed property, who mu&s;t greatly &s;uffer by this unnatural war, make a glorious &s;tand again&s;t the enemies of public freedom, and the con&s;titutional rights of the colonies; for, with the ruin of America, mu&s;t be involved that of England.</P>
<P>Let them, in plain terms, declare their own &s;trength, and the power of the people, a power that has hitherto with&s;tood the united efforts of fraud and tyranny; a power to which all Kings have ever owed their crowns; a power which rai&s;es them to a throne, and, when unworthy of their delegated tru&s;t, can pull them down.</P>
<P>Let them declare to the world, they will never be &s;o ba&s;e and cowardly as quietly to &s;ee any part of their fellow &s;ubjects butchered, or en&s;laved, either in England or America, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of exalted villany; and by that means become the dete&s;ted in&s;truments of their own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Let them declare to the world, they are not yet ripe for &s;lavery, that their forefathers
<PB N="28" REF="013927_0004_0F925774424131B8">made a noble re&s;i&s;tance, and obtained a deci|&s;ive victory over tyranny and lawle&s;s power, when the Stuarts reigned; that they are deter|mined to do them&s;elves ju&s;tice, and not to &s;uffer any farther attacks upon their freedom, from the pre&s;ent Sovereign, who is exceed|ingly de&s;irous, as well as ambitious, to de&s;troy the liberties of mankind; but that they do in&s;i&s;t upon a re&s;toration of their own violated rights, and the rights of Briti&s;h America.</P>
<P>Let them enter into an a&s;&s;ociation for the pre&s;ervation of their lives, rights, liberties, and privileges; and re&s;olve at once to bring the whole legion of public traitors, who have wickedly entered into a con&s;piracy to de&s;troy the dear bought rights of this free nation to condign puni&s;hment, for their pa&s;t and pre|&s;ent diabolical proceedings, which have al|ready &s;tained the land with blood, and theaten de&s;truction to the human race.</P>
<P>A few &s;pirited re&s;olutions from the city of London, and the whole body of merchants of England, would &s;trike terror into the &s;ouls of tho&s;e mi&s;creants, the authors of the&s;e dread|ful public mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>The grand principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, which is the fir&s;t and fundamental law of na|ture, calls aloud for &s;uch exertions of public &s;pirit; the &s;ecurity of the nation depends upon it? Ju&s;tice and the pre&s;ervation of our own, and the lives of our fellow &s;ubjects in America, demand it. The very being of the con&s;titution makes it nece&s;&s;ary, and whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety mu&s;t be ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="013927_0005_0F92577503D41E28">
The pre&s;ent con&s;pirators again&s;t the peace and happine&s;s of mankind ought to know, that no &s;ubterfuges, no knavi&s;h &s;ubtilities, no eva&s;ions, no combinations, nor pretended com|mi&s;&s;ions, &s;hall be able to &s;creen or protect them from public ju&s;tice. They ought to know that the people can follow them through all their labyrinths and doubling meanders; a power confined by no limitations but of pub|lic ju&s;tice, and the public good; a power that does not always follow precedents, but makes them; a power which has this for its prin|ciple, that extraordinary and unprecedented villanies ought to have extraordinary and un|precedented puni&s;hments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>To the</HI> Officers, Soldiers, <HI>and</HI> Seamen, <HI>who may be employed to</HI> butcher <HI>their relations, friends, and fellow &s;ubjects in America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>You can neither be ignorant of, or unac|quainted with the arbitrary &s;teps that the pre|&s;ent King, &s;upported by an abandoned mini|&s;try, and a venal &s;et of pro&s;tituted Lords and Commons, is now pur&s;uing to overturn the &s;acred con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, which he had &s;worn to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>You are not, or will not long be ignorant that the King, the Lords and Commons, have (to &s;atiate their revenge again&s;t a few in|dividuals) declared the whole people of Ame|rica to be in a &s;tate of rebellion, only becau&s;e they have openly avowed their re&s;olution to &s;upport their charters, rights and liberties,
<PB N="30" REF="013927_0006_0F92577613BBF4C8">again&s;t the &s;ecret machinations of de&s;igning men, who would de&s;troy them, and you are fixed upon as the in&s;truments of their de|&s;truction. However, I entertain too good an opinion of you to believe there is ONE TRUE ENGLISHMAN, who will under|take the BLOODY work. Men without fortunes, principles or connexions, may in|deed handle their arms in any de&s;perate cau&s;e, to oblige a tyrant, or mon&s;ter in human &s;hape; but men of family and fortune, or of hone&s;t principles, I hope could never be pre|vailed upon to &s;heath their &s;words in the bow|els of their countrymen. Engli&s;hmen &s;urely cannot be found to execute &s;o diabolical a deed, to embrue their hands in innocent blood, and fight again&s;t their friends and country; actions which mu&s;t brand them with perpetual marks of reproach and infamy.</P>
<P>O! my countrymen, let neither private in|tere&s;t, nor friend&s;hip, neither relations nor connexions, prevail with, or induce you to obey (as you mu&s;t an&s;wer at the la&s;t day, be|fore the awful judge of the world, for the blood that will be wantonly and cruelly &s;pilt) the murderous orders of an inhuman tyrant; who, to gratify his lu&s;t of power, would lay wa&s;te the world. No, rather enter into a &s;o|lemn league, and join with the re&s;t of your countrymen, to oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures of government planned for our ruin.</P>
<P>When your country calls, then &s;tand forth and defend the cau&s;e of liberty, de&s;pi&s;e the
<PB N="31" REF="013927_0007_0F92577B070FA5D0">degeneracy of the age, the venality of the times, and hand freedom down to po&s;terity: that your children may &s;miling ble&s;s, not cur&s;e, your warlike re&s;olution. To die glo|riou&s;ly fighting for the laws and liberties of your country, is honorable, and would de|&s;erve a crown of martyrdom; to die fighting again&s;t it is infamy, and you would for ever de&s;erve the heavie&s;t cur&s;es and execrations.</P>
<P>I hope neither you nor the Iri&s;h have forgot the &s;hameful in&s;ults you have received from the King ever &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war. You have been de&s;pi&s;ed, neglected, and treated with contempt, while a parcel of beggarly Scotchmen only have been put into every place of profit and tru&s;t, in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, in England and America, and the preference has, of honor and promo|tions, been con&s;tantly given to tho&s;e people, nay even to rebels, and &s;ome who have &s;erved in the French &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, if you can be prevailed upon to butcher, or en&s;lave your fellow &s;ubjects, and to &s;et up an arbitrary power on the ruins of public liberty, that your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence would &s;oon be reduced to the mi&s;erable pittance of foreign troops; and you, with the &s;urviving &s;ubjects of England and America, be re|duced to the mi&s;erable condition of being ruled by an army of Scotch janizaries, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>Let every Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h officer, &s;oldier, and &s;eaman, &s;eriou&s;ly weigh the&s;e things; and
<PB N="32" REF="013927_0008_0F92577CA23BA048">then if they are valiant, courageous, magna|nimous and free, like their forefathers; if they are true to their King and their country; if they value their religion, laws, lives, liber|ties, families and po&s;terity, no con&s;ideration can prevail with them to engage again&s;t the Americans in an inhuman bloody civil war.</P>
<P>Let every man then, who is really and truly a Prote&s;tant, who wi&s;hes well to his country and the rights of mankind, lay a&s;ide his prejudices, and con&s;ider the cau&s;e of Ame|rica, and her &s;ucce&s;s in this &s;truggle for free|dom, as a thing of the la&s;t con&s;equence to England, upon which our &s;alvation depends, for the pre&s;ent plan of royal de&s;poti&s;m is a plan of general ruin. I &s;ay, let us all &s;pee|dily unite, and endeavour to defend them from their open, and our&s;elves from our own &s;ecret and dome&s;tic enemies, and if any are lukewarm in this great public cau&s;e, and at this time of imminent danger, let them be made an example of treachery and cowardice, that the pre&s;ent generation may dete&s;t and abhor them, and po&s;terity declaim again&s;t and cur&s;e them, as unnatural mon&s;ters, who would de&s;troy the human race.</P>
