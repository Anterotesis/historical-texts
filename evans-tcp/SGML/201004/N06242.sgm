<HEAD>AN ADDRESS. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY De&s;ign in this Addre&s;s is to repre&s;ent, to the People in this Country, the very great Importance of treating the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> who live among us, and upon our Borders, in a ju&s;t, kind and charitable Manner; and that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endea|vour to attach them to us, and to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. This, I apprehend, is a Subject that has been too much neglected, and that greatly wants to be &s;et in a clear and ju&s;t Light. And I &s;incerely wi&s;h that &s;ome Gentleman of greater Abilities and Addre&s;s than I can pretend to, would take it in Hand: Tho' if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of mov|ing others to do Ju&s;tice to a Subject of &s;uch Weight, I &s;hall heartily rejoice in it.</P>
<P>That I may offer what I have to &s;ay in the clear|e&s;t and mo&s;t conci&s;e Manner I can, I &s;hall go into the following Method.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that it is of va&s;t Importance to the <HI>Briti&s;h Provinces</HI> and <HI>Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> e&s;pecially to the <HI>Provinces</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, New-York,</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> that they be in good Terms with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and attach them to their Intere&s;t. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, by what <HI>Means</HI> this may be effected: Or what are the mo&s;t likely Methods to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="007917_0003_102E00F54AFBFB30">
1. I am to &s;hew, that it is of va&s;t Importance, that we be in good Terms with the <HI>Natives;</HI> and that we engage them in our Intere&s;t. I freely grant, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;imply con&s;idered, are not of &s;uch great Con&s;equence to us. We can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. But yet, their Trade is a con&s;iderable Ar|ticle, worthy the Care of any politick People, and managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield us great Profit. But if we con&s;ider them with Re|lation to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> as attached to us, or to our <HI>Enemies,</HI> they are of the la&s;t Importance to us; for they certainly have the Ballance of Power in their Hands, and are able to turn it for or again&s;t us, ac|cording as they &s;tand affected to us. <HI>Canada,</HI> in|con&s;iderable as it is, and from which, &s;eparate from the <HI>Indians,</HI> we have little or nothing to fear, in Time of War; <HI>Canada,</HI> I &s;ay, would be more than a Match for us, in ca&s;e they join with them again&s;t us. He mu&s;t be a great Stranger to, and very ig|norant of, the Circum&s;tances both of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who is not &s;en&s;ible of this. Our Circum|&s;tances are &s;uch, that we cannot guard our&s;elves again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of &s;uch Enemies in Time of War; for our <HI>Frontiers</HI> are of va&s;t Extent, and border upon the adjacent Wilderne&s;s; which, tho' almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to us, yet is the very Element in which they delight to live. They are at Home in it. The People therefore who inhabit our Frontiers, while they follow their nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s, are expo&s;ed to be an ea&s;y Prey to them; and many of them have been &s;urpriz'd in their Fields and Hou&s;es, and in a mo&s;t barbarous Manner put to Death. A &s;mall Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> encouraged and &s;upported by the <HI>French</HI> (which they are ready enough to do) can ea&s;ily keep us in a con&s;tant Alarm, put us to an immen&s;e Charge, de&s;troy many, and impoveri&s;h more, in our expo&s;ed Places, and not put them&s;elves
<PB N="5" REF="007917_0004_102E00F8A0E259A8">at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account in it; for as they live by Hunting, &s;o where Game is mo&s;t plenty they are be&s;t off: And where can they find a better Supply, than among our Cattle, Sheep, and Corn-Fields? There they live at Ea&s;e, di&s;tre&s;s and impoveri&s;h us, and the adjacent Wilderne&s;s is their Refuge. By retiring into it, they are &s;oon out of our Reach; and long Experience has taught us how ineffectual the Mea&s;ures we have taken for our Safety and Defence have proved.</P>
<P>Some, I am &s;en&s;ible, will &s;ay, let us not be at any Co&s;t and Pains to gain the Friend&s;hip of &s;uch a perfidious Crew, but let us de&s;troy them all. Quickly &s;aid indeed, but not &s;o &s;oon nor &s;o ea&s;ily effected. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are for de&s;troying them would doubtle&s;s &s;oon do it, were they fir&s;t bound and delivered up to them. But one Que|&s;tion here is, how we &s;hall get them into our Pow|er? And another is, Whether it would be &s;o hu|mane, generous and Chri&s;tian-like, to take away their Lives, were that in our Power, as it would be to cultivate Friend&s;hip with them, and to &s;eek their be&s;t Good? If we &s;hould be &s;o &s;anguine as to en|deavour to de&s;troy them, it would doubtle&s;s prove a vain Attempt; and &s;erve only to drive them to the <HI>French,</HI> who would be very ready to receive and protect them. If we neglect them, and take no Mea&s;ures to engage them in our Intere&s;t, or to cul|tivate Friend&s;hip with them, this will probably ren|der them indifferent to us, and di&s;po&s;e them to hearken to the enticing In&s;inuations of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;|&s;aries; and our Situation mu&s;t be very unhappy, when they become engaged in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that the <HI>French</HI> have already gained a large Number of <HI>Indians</HI> to their Intere&s;t, and therefore if we u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours to gain others, it will avail nothing; for tho&s;e who are
<PB N="6" REF="007917_0005_102E00FA3B0709C8">devoted to the <HI>French,</HI> will neverthele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s us in Time of War. I reply,</P>
<P>It is very true, that the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> thro' their Policy and Vigilance, have taken the Advan|tage of our Neglect, and gained a large Number of the <HI>Natives</HI> to their Intere&s;t, and are gaining more and more every Year; and &s;ome even from among our own <HI>Indians.</HI> They &s;pare neither Co&s;t nor Pains to accompli&s;h their De&s;igns of this Na|ture, being &s;en&s;ible enough how advantageous it is to them, and how injurious to us; and if they con|tinue to be active, and we negligent, as in Times pa&s;t, is it not too probable that they will, in a lit|tle Time, attach to them&s;elves all the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>North-America?</HI> Does it not then concern us to u&s;e proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this apparent Mi&s;chief, by counter-working the <HI>French?</HI> who are, I &s;uppo&s;e, tampering with all the Tribes of <HI>North-America,</HI> to engage them in their Intere&s;t. And &s;hould we &s;ucceed in our Endeavours (as it is highly probable we might, if proper Steps were taken) &s;o as to engage the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and &s;ome other Tribes, in hearty Friend&s;hip with us; and e&s;pecially if we &s;hould be&s;tow &s;uch Favours upon them, as would induce them to &s;ettle upon our Frontiers; it would in all Probability prevent the Evil &s;poken of in the Objection; for the <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada</HI> would not mole&s;t us, if a Number of the Natives, in hearty Friend&s;hip with us, were placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a very plain Proof the la&s;t War, in the Safety of <HI>Stock|bridge,</HI> and the adjacent Places, from any Attempts of the Enemy from <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stockbridge</HI> is in the very Road of, and more ex|po&s;ed to, the <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> than any other Place whatever; and yet we &s;ee that the Enemy turned off Ea&s;t to <HI>Connecticut-River,</HI> and We&s;t to
<PB N="7" REF="007917_0006_102E00FC70B3BE30">the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> they did much Mi&s;|chief; while <HI>Stoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="7 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ffield, New-Marlborough,</HI> and <HI>Number One,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> more expo&s;ed, were not mo|le&s;ted. This, &s;o far as we can di&s;cern, was owing to a &s;mall Number of <HI>Indians</HI> dwelling at <HI>Stock|bridge,</HI> who are our hearty and fa&s;t Friends; which the Enemy being &s;en&s;ible of, cared not to come within their Reach, le&s;t they &s;hould be taken in their own Snare. And if we &s;hould encourage the Settlement of other <HI>Indian</HI> Towns upon our Frontiers, where Hunting is mo&s;t handy to them, as <HI>Stockbridge</HI> has been encouraged; &s;hould we give them Town&s;hips of Land &s;uitable for their Improve|ment, build a Meeting-Hou&s;e and School-Hou&s;e in each Town, and &s;upport Mini&s;ters and School-Ma|&s;ters in them; would not this convince them that we are their true Friends, and &s;eek their Good? Would it not induce them to &s;ettle in our Borders? e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them who are de&s;irous that they them&s;elves and their Children &s;hould be in&s;tructed? Would they not be a Guard to us in Time of War? And if, after all, we &s;hould meet with &s;ome Trou|ble from the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> might it not be ef|fectually prevented, by playing our <HI>Indians</HI> upon them, as they do theirs upon us? And would not the Charge of all this be a Tri&s;le, compared with that of defending our&s;elves in Time of War? But if we neglect them, and take no Mea&s;ures to culti|vate Friend&s;hip with them, and e&s;pecially if we deal injuriou&s;ly by them, &s;hall we not put an Advantage into the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> (which they will not fail of improving) to engage them in their Intere&s;t, and to employ them again&s;t us in Time of War? which would prove a very great Calamity to us, if not our utter Ruin. The&s;e Things con&s;idered, is it not of very great Importance, that we be at good Terms with the neighbouring <HI>Natives?</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="007917_0007_102E00FF8713C868">
2. I will, in the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">eavour to &s;hew what are the likely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> this to pa&s;s: Or what Mea&s;ures we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> with the <HI>Indians,</HI> if we would engage them in hearty Friend&s;hip with us.</P>
<P>And here, in general, our Conduct towards them mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;hall make them &s;en&s;ible that we are indeed their hearty Friends; and &s;uch al&s;o as &s;hall convince them that it is their Intere&s;t and Advan|tage to be in Friend&s;hip with us. Nothing &s;hort of this, I apprehend, will attach them to us, &s;o as to an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed. If we often treat with them, renew the Friend&s;hip, and be&s;tow upon them large Pre&s;ents: Or, as they phra&s;e it, Smoke to|gether, brighten the Chain, or put the Brands to|gether, to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave Room for them to &s;uppo&s;e that this proceeds nor from true Friend&s;hip, but rather from Fear of them, or from Su&s;picion that they will join with our Enemies, &amp;c. this will never be &s;ufficient to engage them; the utmo&s;t we can rationally expect from it is, that they will not openly break with us, but keep up a Shew of Friend&s;hip, that they may have the Benefit of future Pre&s;ents at our Hands.</P>
<P>Again, if we &s;hould by any Means convince them that we are their true Friends, and yet not go into &s;uch Mea&s;ures with them as &s;hould turn to their <HI>Ad|vantage,</HI> they would hardly be engaged for us. As all other People are governed by <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;o are they. And the principal Handle we can take hold of, to attach them to us by, is their <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and that would not fail of doing it. If a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> can &s;ell their Skins to us for <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> and buy their Blankets for <HI>Ten Shillings;</HI> they will never go to <HI>Canada</HI> where they mu&s;t &s;ell their Skins for <HI>Ten Shillings,</HI> and give <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> for a Blan|ket. Convince them that it is much for their Intere&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="007917_0008_102E01011F8922A8">and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we need not fear but that they will be &s;o. Now, in or|der to convince them that we are truly their Friends, and that it is their Intere&s;t to be ours, we mu&s;t,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, treat them according to the Rules of Equity and Ju&s;tice. We mu&s;t not de|fraud and oppre&s;s them, but be hone&s;t and ju&s;t in our Dealings with them.</P>
<P>The Natives, with whom we have to do, are Per|&s;ons of &s;o much Sagacity, that they can di&s;tingui&s;h between ju&s;t and injurious Treatment, as well as other Men. They are al&s;o as ready to re&s;ent, and perhaps more forward to revenge Injuries, than any other People under Heaven. If therefore we treat them in an unju&s;t Manner, we may rationally expect that they will be &s;o far from being our Friends, that they will join with our Enemies, and &s;eek Oppor|tunities of Revenge.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the <HI>Indians</HI> are generally addicted to Drunkenne&s;s, and that when they have ta&s;ted a little Liquor, they have a &s;trong Thir&s;t for more, and will part with any Thing they have, for a &s;ufficient Quantity to make them drunk.&mdash;And is it not as well known, that we have taken the Ad|vantage of this their vicious Appetite, and for a few Quarts of Rum have purcha&s;ed valuable Effects of them? Have not private Per&s;ons thus made their Gains of them, notwith&s;tanding the good Laws that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not this the Manner of all private Traders, who go among their &s;everal Tribes for Gain?</P>
<P>In our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Hou&s;es, where Rum has been freely &s;old them, Care has been taken that they &s;hould not be cheated, but that they &s;hould have the full Value of what they had to &s;ell: An Indian therefore, who was Owner of a Pack of Beaver, Deer&s;kins, or any o|ther
<PB N="10" REF="007917_0009_102E0103AEACC2D0">valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity of Rum, and might get drunk perhaps ten times, or more; whereas, if he had fallen into private Hands, he mu&s;t have contented him&s;elf with being drunk but once or twice. Which of the&s;e proves mo&s;t in|jurious to the <HI>Indians</HI> in the End, I &s;hall not pre|tend to determine.</P>
<P>When they are thus intoxicated, they fall out a|mong them&s;elves, fight; and &s;ometimes kill one another, and &s;ome have drunk them&s;elves dead on the Spot. An In&s;tance of each of the&s;e there has been, if I am rightly informed, at <HI>Fort Dummer,</HI> &s;ince that has been improved as a Truck-Hou&s;e. And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie upon us, I leave others to judge.</P>
<P>Now, if we treat the <HI>Natives</HI> in this Form, will they, can they, live with us? Will not the Law of Self-Pre&s;ervation oblige them to leave us, and to go where they may be better u&s;ed? Some of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> plainly &s;peak it out, and &s;ay, "We cannot live with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> they bring us &s;o much Rum, that it de&s;troys us; we mu&s;t go to the <HI>French,</HI> who will let us have but little &s;trong Drink." Thus we alienate the <HI>Indians</HI> from us, and as it were oblige them to go over to the <HI>French,</HI> who are often our Enemies, and fail not to employ them a|gain&s;t us in Time of War. And if we proceed to deal thus injuriou&s;ly with them, what can we expect but that they will leave us, and be a &s;evere Scourge to us?</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Indians,</HI> are &s;unk below the Dignity of human Nature, and their Lu&s;t after Drink expo&s;es them to be cheated out of what little they have; yet this gives us no Right to deal unju&s;tly by them. They have a natural Right to Ju&s;tice, and may, with great Propriety, challenge it at our Hands, &s;ee|ing we profe&s;s to be &s;ubject to the Laws of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="007917_0010_102E010741A1A5F8">which teach us to do <HI>that which is altogether ju&s;t.</HI> And we &s;hould be &s;o far from taking the Advantage of their Ignorance, Vice and Poverty, to defraud them of what is their ju&s;t Right, that we &s;hould ra|ther be moved to Pity, and compa&s;&s;ionate their de|plorable State, and be <HI>Eyes to the Blind,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am fully per&s;uaded, that if we were upright and ju&s;t in all our Tran&s;actions with them; if our Trade with them was put into the Hands of faithful Men, who would deal ju&s;tly by them; and if they were &s;up|plied with all Nece&s;&s;aries for them&s;elves and Families at a moderate Price, it would not be in the Power of all the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada</HI> (&s;ubtle as they are) to alienate them from us. The <HI>French</HI> are not upon equal Ground with us in this Affair. For their Northern Climate is much more inho&s;pitable and &s;evere than ours is: Their Country is not &s;o productive of tho&s;e Fruits, which the <HI>Indians</HI> very much live upon, as ours: Nor can they afford Goods which are proper and nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>Indians</HI> at &s;o cheap a Lay as we can: Therefore we can give them tho&s;e Advantages which <HI>Canada</HI> cannot. We can, without Damage to our&s;elves, make it their Intere&s;t to adhere to us: And when Experience has once taught them, that their Intere&s;t lies with us, they will want no other Inducement to engage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach tho&s;e of them to us, who are not yet gone to <HI>Canada,</HI> but it will induce tho&s;e who are, to return to their Brethren, for the Sake of the Profit they might reap by it; e&s;pecially if we give them all the Advantage we can, con&s;i&s;tent with our own.</P>
<P>As unju&s;t and abu&s;ive Treatment of the <HI>Indians</HI> tends naturally to alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o a Series of ju&s;t and faithful Dealing with them would be likely to attach them to us, and to make them our fa&s;t Friends.
<PB N="12" REF="007917_0011_102E0108E10166E0">This again appears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the <HI>Tribe</HI> of the <HI>River Indians</HI> who live at <HI>Stockbridge.</HI> For tho' they were, for a con|&s;iderable Time, extremely jealous, that we had &s;ome ill De&s;ign upon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands (a Jealou&s;y founded, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon the ill U&s;age the <HI>Natives</HI> have too often been the Subjects of) yet by the ju&s;t Treat|ment they, for a Cour&s;e of Years, have met with from the <HI>Government,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Sergeant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing to live or die with us, whether in Peace or War.</P>
<P>It is very true, that in order to obtain the End propo&s;ed, our Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> mu&s;t not be in private Hands. It mu&s;t not be in the Power of every private Per&s;on to treat them as he plea&s;es. We may upon good Grounds de&s;pair of their be|ing treated with Equity and Ju&s;tice, if every one may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with them. Our trade therefore mu&s;t be of a publick Nature, and mu&s;t be committed to the Care and Management of faithful Men: Not to &s;uch as will &s;eek the Service, and make Friends to procure the Po&s;t for them; (certain Indications of a Self-&s;eeker) but Men of Uprightne&s;s and Integrity mu&s;t be &s;ought out; &s;uch, and &s;uch only, mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of &s;uch Importance: Good In&s;tructions mu&s;t be given them, which mu&s;t be carefully adhered to.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade at <HI>Canada</HI> was in private Hands; if every private Per&s;on there might deal with the <HI>Indians</HI> at Plea&s;ure, we might then hope that tho&s;e who are gone from us would &s;oon return; for, in that Ca&s;e, it is &s;uppo&s;able enough that they would not meet with much better U&s;age there than they do here; tho' it is &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;able that they
<PB N="13" REF="007917_0012_102E010A84792FF8">would meet with much wor&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> is wholly in the Hands of publick Officers, (if I am rightly informed) and a private Man, if he wants a Dear-&s;kin, a Beaver-&s;kin, &amp;c. is not allowed to purcha&s;e of an <HI>Indian,</HI> but mu&s;t go to the publick Stores. Upon the Suppo&s;ition that tho&s;e Officers are faithful, and deal ju&s;tly by the <HI>Indians,</HI> it is &s;urely a wi&s;e and politick Method to engage them in their Favour. And &s;o long as every private Per&s;on in the Engli&s;h Government is at Li|berty to trade with them, when, and where, he plea|&s;es, and to cheat them out of what they have, what can we expect but that they will repair to <HI>Canada,</HI> where they may be better u&s;ed? Is it not owing to the ill Treatment they have met with from the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that &s;o many of them are gone already? And if no proper Mea&s;ures are taken to prevent their being ill u&s;ed, will not tho&s;e who are yet behind &s;oon follow their Brethren? Yea, if we furni&s;h them with large Quantities of Rum, make them drunk, and then defraud them of what they have, do we not reduce them to a Nece&s;&s;ity, either of living low and mi&s;erable with us, or of going from us, that they may fare better? How low, how di&s;pirited, how mi&s;erable and bruti&s;h the&s;e few are, who live within our Borders, is too manife&s;t. And whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not contributed to their Mi&s;ery, is worthy of our &s;erious Enquiry. Yea, would it not be proper for us to enquire, Whether we have not, by our Neglect and Abu&s;e of them, provoked Heaven to let loo&s;e the Natives upon us, who have been one of the &s;ore&s;t Scourges that we were ever cha&s;ti&s;ed with? What Multitudes have they, in a mo&s;t cruel Manner, murdered in our Borders? How many of our Neigh|bours have they led into Captivity? Some of whom have been redeemed at a very great Expence, and
<PB N="14" REF="007917_0013_102E010CC2DF5618">others are become either Pagans or Papi&s;ts, and con|tinue &s;till in a foreign Land. And who can count the Co&s;t we have been at, to defend our&s;elves again&s;t their Incur&s;ions?</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h Government &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed, in Time to come, to &s;et up and maintain a publick, hone&s;t and ju&s;t Trade with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> or any other Tribes, thereby to attach them to us, to pro|mote their true Intere&s;t, with other valuable Ends, that might thereby be an&s;wered; this Objection perhaps would ari&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch a Proceeding will be a very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade cannot be &s;afe, unle&s;s it be protected by a con&s;iderable Force. A Fort mu&s;t be built, and a Garri&s;on of 50, 60, or perhaps 100 Men, with their proper Officers, mu&s;t be maintained at each Place where the Trade is &s;et up; therefore the Advantage would not countervail the Co&s;t. To this I reply,</P>
<P>If &s;uch Garri&s;ons &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary in the Places where a Trade is &s;et up, to be a Guard to it, the Charge would nothing like equal that of an Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.</P>
<P>But further, I apprehend that the Charge of &s;uch Garri&s;ons might be &s;pared; and that, in&s;tead of be|ing nece&s;&s;ary, they would prove very injurious to the De&s;ign; and that it would be a very wrong Step to be taken in that Affair.</P>
<P>All who are in any good Mea&s;ure acquainted with the <HI>Indians</HI> know, that they are extreamly jealous, le&s;t any Incroachments &s;hould be made upon them; and it is not &s;trange it &s;hould be &s;o, con&s;idering what has pa&s;t over them. And if a Number of armed Men were placed among them, and Forts built for the Defence of our Trade, they would be &s;u&s;|picious that &s;omething ho&s;tile was intended, and we &s;hould not be able to remove the Su&s;picion. They
<PB N="15" REF="007917_0014_102E010E5D88E9C0">would behold us with a jealous Eye, and perhaps take Mea&s;ures to fru&s;trate the whole De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual Way to induce them to tru&s;t us, is to tru&s;t them; and they will be ready enough to protect our Trade if we de&s;ire it, and &s;hew that we confide in them to do it. And when a little Ex|perience has taught them how advantageous &s;uch a Trade would be to them, they would be ready e|nough to do it, for their own Advantage. If there|fore we &s;hould de&s;ire them to admit a Trader into one of their own Forts, or to build a Fort at our Charge in &s;ome convenient Place for &s;uch a De&s;ign, and to take Care that our Trade be &s;afe; this would tend to convince them, both of our Friend|&s;hip to, and of our Confidence in, them; and they would not only be plea&s;ed with it, but al&s;o ambi|tious to &s;hew us that we may &s;afely tru&s;t them: And were I to be the Truck-Ma&s;ter, I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf much &s;afer in their Protection, than in a Garri&s;on of 100 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men: For if &s;uch a Gar|ri&s;on &s;hould be placed among them, they them|&s;elves would &s;u&s;pect &s;ome ill De&s;ign carrying on a|gain&s;t them; and the <HI>French</HI> would infallibly tell them, that tho' we pretended Peace and Friend|&s;hip, yet our De&s;ign in the End is to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>If indeed a Truck-Ma&s;ter &s;hould prove an un|faithful Servant, and enrich him&s;elf by defrauding them, he might have Occa&s;ion for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldi|ers to protect him and his Stores; but if they found him faithful, friendly and ju&s;t in his Dealings with them, they would be as careful of him as of their own Eyes, and venture their own Lives for him. What would not the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Stockbridge</HI> have done for Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> in his Day, whom they had found to be their true and hearty Friend? And what would they not now do for Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> of
<PB N="16" REF="007917_0015_102E0111F89828C0">whom they have had the like Experience? <HI>Indi|ans</HI> will be as ready as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and perhaps much more &s;o, to &s;erve and protect, if there be Occa&s;ion, tho&s;e whom they have found to be their faithful and real Friends.</P>
<P>In a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in Times pa&s;t treated the Natives according to the Rules of Equity and Ju&s;tice, it would have been quite &s;ufficient to have engaged them in our Intere&s;t, and to have kept them in Amity and Friend&s;hip with us; and that, even now, they might in a little Time be attached to us, by &s;uch Treatment: But this, I confe&s;s, I de&s;pair of, if every private Per&s;on mu&s;t be left at his Liberty to treat them as he plea&s;es, and to defraud them of all they have; which I take to be the Ca&s;e in <HI>New-York</HI> Government, who lie next to the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and have their Trade; tho' in this <HI>Province</HI> we have good Laws in Force to re&s;train private Per&s;ons from &s;elling them &s;trong Drink.</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hould al&s;o exerci&s;e that Kindne&s;s and Ge|nero&s;ity towards them, that &s;hall convince them that it is for their Intere&s;t to be in Friend&s;hip with us. We &s;hould not, in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Importance, con|tent our&s;elves with being barely ju&s;t in our Treat|ment of them, but we &s;hould al&s;o be kind and ge|nerous, as a proper Expedient to obtain the End propo&s;ed: I am aware, I &s;hall here be quickly inter|rupted with this Exclamation;</P>
<P>What! <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> to &s;uch an ungrateful evil Crew! To which I &s;hall only an&s;wer, We have good Authority for being <HI>kind to the Unthankful, and to the Evil.</HI> And if that good Being who recom|mends it to us, had not given an Example of it, in his Dealings with us, how deplorable had our State been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is recom|mended to us in the Go&s;pel, not only becau&s;e it is the Will of our heavenly Father that we &s;hould be
<PB N="17" REF="007917_0016_102E011399894EC8">kind, but al&s;o becau&s;e the Exerci&s;e of it an&s;wers ex|cellent Ends; produces very good and de&s;irable Effects; &s;uch as Love, Friend&s;hip, Peace, &amp;c. And while we make a Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, it is Pity the Practice of it, in &s;o material an Article, &s;hould be objected again&s;t. And is it not very pro|per that we &s;hould exerci&s;e Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity to the poor Natives, when there is a &s;trong Probabi|lity of its being of very happy Con&s;equence both to them and us?</P>
<P>A great deal of Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity has been exerci&s;ed towards the River <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> by this <HI>Government,</HI> by the honourable <HI>Corporation</HI> at Home, by their honourable and reverend <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ioners</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hollis,</HI> by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sergeant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and others; and the Con&s;equence has been very happy as to them; they are brought to the Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, and to a Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; and many of them, we hope, to the &s;aving Knowledge of God. We al&s;o have found the Benefit of this kind U&s;age of them; for thereby they are become our hearty Friends, are united to us in their Affections, and were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of co|vering our mo&s;t We&s;tern Frontiers the la&s;t War. And were the like Kindne&s;s &s;hewn by us to other Tribes, is there not Room to hope that the Effects might be alike happy? If Town&s;hips, &s;uitable for <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;ettle in, were provided in our Frontiers, and it were propo&s;ed to them, that if they would come and &s;ettle in them, they &s;hould not only enjoy the Land as their own, but al&s;o have a Mini&s;ter &s;upport|ed among them to in&s;truct them in the Chri&s;tian Religion; and al&s;o a School-Ma&s;ter to teach their Children to read and write; would not this induce many of them, e&s;pecially of the better Sort, to come and &s;ettle in our Borders? And would they
<PB N="18" REF="007917_0017_102E0116066CFD30">not cover our Frontiers in ca&s;e of a War with <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>What has been done for the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> has doubtle&s;s been much ob&s;erved and approved of by the <HI>Natives</HI> far and near. That there is a School &s;et up at <HI>Canada,</HI> in Imitation of Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI>'s School at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> and a large Number of Scho|lars in it, we have heard and receive for Truth. That the <HI>French,</HI> who e&s;teem Ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion, and do not de&s;ire to teach the <HI>Indians</HI> any Thing more than to &s;ay their Beads, and to cro&s;s them&s;elves, have done this out of Choice, is not at all likely. They do not de&s;ire that their <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould become a knowing People. But yet, being &s;en&s;ible that the Report of Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI>'s School had &s;pread it&s;elf far and wide, and that their <HI>Indians</HI> were plea&s;ed with the Method the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had taken to furni&s;h the <HI>Natives</HI> with Knowledge, they apprehended, that unle&s;s &s;omething like it were done among among them, there would be Danger of the <HI>Indians</HI> repairing to us for In&s;truction, and to prevent this, and to engage them to them&s;elves, they &s;et up their School. This, I conjecture, is the Truth of the Ca&s;e. And if &s;o, it is manife&s;t that the <HI>Indians</HI> are inclined to &s;eek after Knowledge; and therefore would be di&s;po&s;ed to hearken to &s;uch kind and generous Propo&s;als, if they were made to them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the other Tribe, would gladly &s;ettle &s;uch Towns, if they were invited to it in a proper Manner?</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Step, and perhaps the mo&s;t promi&s;ing one we can take, to engage the <HI>Indians</HI> in Friend|&s;hip with us is, to &s;end Mi&s;&s;ionaries among their re&s;pective Tribes, Mini&s;ters and Schoolma&s;ters, to in&s;truct them in the Principles, and to per&s;uade them to the Practice of Chri&s;tianity. Tho' they have &s;o long lived near us, and been conver&s;ant with us, yet
<PB N="19" REF="007917_0018_102E0118E047A048">they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation, Strangers to the Go&s;pel, and are peri&s;hing for lack of Knowledge: A Ca&s;e that might well move our Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion towards them, and put us up|on doing what we can for their Relief. And whe|ther our former Neglect of Things of this Nature has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy of our &s;erious Enquiry.</P>
<P>The Intere&s;t the Rev. Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> had in the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> while he was with them, the Reforma|tion of Manners he wrought among them, their Willingne&s;s to receive In&s;truction, and their En|gagedne&s;s to pro&s;ecute Learning, are a plain Indi|cation that faithful Mi&s;&s;ionaries would be welcome to them. And the <HI>Five Nations</HI> being neare&s;t us, and their Friend&s;hip of very great Con&s;equence, it might be proper to begin with them: And what has been done among them by Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> and others, might be no &s;mall Help in the Ca&s;e. If we &s;hould &s;end Per&s;ons well qualified for the Bu&s;ine&s;s to re&s;ide among them, and &s;upport them well, there would be no Foundation for any Jealou&s;y that we have an ill De&s;ign upon them, and if at any time &s;uch Jealou&s;ies &s;hould ari&s;e, they would &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide, upon the <HI>In|dians</HI> having a little Experience of our Kindne&s;s and Friend&s;hip to them. The prudent Conduct and faithful Labours of &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ionaries might, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;erve to remove their Barbarity, correct their Manners, reform their Lives, promote in them virtuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form them to true Religion. This we may hope would be the happy Event, with Re&s;pect to many of them, tho' not to all; and if, by much Labour and Ex|pence, it might be brought to pa&s;s, &s;hould we not find our Account in it; for what would be the Charge of &s;upporting a few Mi&s;&s;ionaries, compared with that of an <HI>Indian</HI> War? And is there not great
<PB N="20" REF="007917_0019_102E011C00E0C310">Probability that &s;uch Mea&s;ures would in a few Years Time attach them to us in a hearty Friend&s;hip? And if the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> who are a Terror to, and have in great Mea&s;ure the Command of, other Tribes, were indeed our Friends, and made &s;o by &s;uch Obligations laid upon them, would it not be an effectual Means of re&s;training other <HI>Indians</HI> from giving us Trouble in ca&s;e of a War?</P>
<P>The general Objection here, I am &s;en&s;ible, will be;&mdash;There is no Likelihood of &s;ucceeding, and therefore it is not worth While to make any Trial; it would only be to &s;pend Labour and Money to no good Purpo&s;e. To which I reply,</P>
<P>How can we draw the Conclu&s;ion before we have made the Experiment? Have we ever made any pro|per Trial, and found our&s;elves di&s;appointed? And can it be looked upon ju&s;t to draw &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion, in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Importance, unle&s;s we had better Grounds for it?</P>
<P>It is true, Mr. <HI>Sergeant</HI> made a Vi&s;it to the <HI>Su&s;|quehanna Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Brainard</HI> al&s;o, in his Day, did the &s;ame, without Succe&s;s; but we know that the Excu&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> made was, that they held their Lands of the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and therefore could not comply with &s;uch a Motion, till their Con&s;ent was fir&s;t obtained. And be&s;ides, &s;hall we e&s;teem two or three Vi&s;its made by private Per&s;ons a &s;uffi|cient Trial in this Ca&s;e? Sufficient indeed it was to &s;hew that tho&s;e good Gentlemen were po&s;&s;e&s;t of an excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal for the Good of the poor Natives; but yet I apprehend not &s;uf|ficient to di&s;courage further Attempts. If tho&s;e Gentlemen, who went in a private Capacity, had &s;u&s;tained a publick Character, perhaps they had been more regarded. But however, when we have u&s;ed our be&s;t Endeavours, and they indeed prove un|&s;ucce&s;sful, we may be excu&s;able; but can we look
<PB N="21" REF="007917_0020_102E011D9C490720">upon our&s;elves &s;o, if we fit &s;till, and u&s;e no Endea|vours for the Help of tho&s;e poor benighted People?</P>
<P>If proper Attempts &s;hould be made for Chri|&s;tianizing the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> there would, I am &s;en|&s;ible, &s;ome notable Difficulties lie in the Way, but yet perhaps none but what might be &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>One Difficulty that would doubtle&s;s attend &s;uch a laudable Undertaking, would ari&s;e from tho&s;e who maintain a private Trade among them, from which they reap great Gain; e&s;pecially by the Article of Rum, too much of which they convey to them; and by the Influence of which the <HI>Indians</HI> are ea&s;ily defrauded.</P>
<P>The&s;e Traders would be very &s;en&s;ible, that if Chri|&s;tianity &s;hould prevail among tho&s;e <HI>Nations,</HI> the <HI>Hope of their Gain</HI> would be <HI>gone,</HI> and <HI>&s;eeing by this Craft they have their Wealth,</HI> they would u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to di&s;&s;uade the <HI>Indians</HI> from embracing the Ways of Religion. They in Fact did &s;o at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> where the Number of <HI>Indians</HI> was &s;mall, and their Trade not &s;o con&s;iderable. How much more then will they do it, if Endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed to convert the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> who&s;e Trade is va&s;tly more advantageous? But as the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hou&s;atunnuk,</HI> by Mr <HI>Sergeant</HI>'s Help, &s;aw thro' the Artifice they u&s;ed, and were made &s;en&s;ible of the &s;elfi&s;h Views of the Traders, &s;o doubtle&s;s the <HI>Five Nations</HI> may ea&s;ily be informed, and the Ob|&s;truction &s;oon removed.</P>
<P>Another Difficulty will ari&s;e from the fal&s;e In&s;inua|tions of <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, who will not fail to tell them, that we are about to teach them a fal&s;e Reli|gion, and if they hearken to us, they will all cer|tainly be damned. But when tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are pro|perly informed of the Conduct of the <HI>French,</HI> and other Roman Catholicks, how they deny the U&s;e of the Bible to the common People among them&s;elves,
<PB N="22" REF="007917_0021_102E011FD49D30F0">and that they have no De&s;ign to acquaint the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> with the Word of God: And on the other Hand, that our De&s;ign is not to impo&s;e upon them, but to open the Bible to them, to enable them to read it, and to judge for them&s;elves; will not this &s;atisfy them of our hone&s;t Intentions towards them, and of the Safety and Propriety of their examining Things, that they may form a Judgment for them|&s;elves?</P>
<P>A third, and perhaps much the greate&s;t Difficul|ty that would attend this good De&s;ign is, that tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> e&s;teem them&s;elves Chri&s;tians already, and value them&s;elves upon their being as good Chri&s;tians as their Neighbours. Mr. <HI>Sergeant,</HI> in his Journal of <HI>November</HI> 25, 1734, &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>The <HI>Mohawks</HI> are generally Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tanity, but for want of In&s;truction have but little of it in Reality.&mdash;</Q> They are &s;o ignorant of the Principles of Religion, that they know not the Difference between one who is baptized, and calls him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and one who lives agreeably to the Rules Chri&s;t has given us to walk by. They are not &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being conformed to tho&s;e Rules of Virtue and Holi|ne&s;s which Chri&s;t has pre&s;cribed. <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries have baptized &s;ome of them, others (as I have been informed) have been baptized by <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters; and they e&s;teem it a Privilege belonging to them to have their Children baptized, whenever they pre&s;ent them, without any Regard being had, either to the Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Edu|cation of the Child. When the Rev. Mr. <HI>Spen|cer</HI> was among them a few Years ago, they were much di&s;plea&s;ed that he declined baptizing &s;ome Children, who&s;e Parents were notoriou&s;ly ignorant, vicious and wicked. Some <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> who had an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman to their Mother, came a few Years pa&s;t to <HI>We&s;tfield</HI> to vi&s;it their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="007917_0022_102E0122EDB32860">Relations there, and while they &s;taid at that Place, they had a Child born, and were much offended with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Balantine,</HI> who declined bap|tizing of it, as they de&s;ired. Since the Rev. Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has been at <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> one of the <HI>Mo|hawks</HI> re&s;iding there had a Child born, and was highly affronted becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> did not bap|tize it upon his De&s;ire. From the&s;e In&s;tances it is evident, that they account their Children have Right to Bapti&s;m, whenever they de&s;ire it. And being baptized, they e&s;teem them good Chri&s;tians, what|ever their Conver&s;ation may be; for they derive their Notions of Chri&s;tianity, not from the Bible (to which they are Strangers) but from the Example of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> with whom they are conver|&s;ant, and who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>And &s;o far forth as being baptized, in the fore-mentioned Manner, and calling them&s;elves Chri&s;tians will make them &s;o, they are &s;o to be e&s;teemed. Now the&s;e Things being &s;o, it may prove a difficult Thing to make them &s;en&s;ible, that Drunkenne&s;s, and other vicious Practices, are incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;ti|anity; becau&s;e the&s;e Chri&s;tians, who fall under their Ob&s;ervation, give them an Example of Vice, and go &s;uch Lengths therein.</P>
<P>But yet I apprehend this Difficulty might al&s;o be removed, by giving them a ju&s;t and true Account of the Nature and Extent of the Chri&s;tian Religion, by informing them what the Will of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is; how he expects that we &s;hould be conformed to his Like|ne&s;s, and to his Laws. The <HI>Indians</HI> are as capable of hearing Rea&s;ons, and giving them their Weight, as other Men; and it is becau&s;e they know not what Chri&s;tianity is, that they e&s;teem them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, in their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. When they are made acquainted with the Terms of Salva|tion, propo&s;ed in the Go&s;pel, and what they mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="007917_0023_102E012521B86E58">do that they may inherit eternal Life; when they are well in&s;tructed in the Doctrines of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they will be &s;en&s;ible that the Religion which they now have, is little or nothing like that which is taught by the Go&s;pel. When Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> refu&s;ed to bap|tize a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Child born at <HI>Stockbridge</HI> (which I have before mentioned) and they were very much di&s;|plea&s;ed with him on that Account, he went to them, gave them the Rea&s;ons of his Conduct, and inform|ed them as clearly as he was able, of the Nature and End of Bapti&s;m: Tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> received the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">orce of his Rea&s;ons, and appeared to be &s;atisfied and contented, when he had taken Pains to inform them. And I doubt not but proper In&s;truction and Information would remove the Difficulty I have been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Tho' Chri&s;tianizing tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> may prove a difficult Work, yet if our Endeavours might, by the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, be &s;ucceeded, would not the Advantage thence ari&s;ing to them, and us, more than compen&s;ate the Pains and Expence we &s;hould be at? And is there not &s;o much Ground to hope for Succe&s;s, as &s;hould induce us to make the Ex|periment?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude, by briefly &s;ugge&s;ting a few Things, not yet mentioned, the &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion of which may excite us to u&s;e our be&s;t Endea|vours for the Conver&s;ion of the neighbouring <HI>Indi|ans</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. And in the fir&s;t Place, &s;hould not the Con|&s;ideration of the divine Bounty and Goodne&s;s, be|&s;towed upon us, excite us to employ Part of that unde&s;erved Goodne&s;s to promote the Knowledge of God, our bountiful Benefactor, among tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of it? Thro' the unde&s;erved Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing of God, we have been pro&s;perous in our &s;ecular Affairs, &s;ucceeded in our Hu&s;bandry,
<PB N="25" REF="007917_0024_102E0128425DBE50">Trade, &amp;c. and are become a wealthy People. And, were we as willing as we are able, might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> not &s;pare large Sums for the Propagation of the Go&s;|pel among the Heathen?

Is it not fit that we &s;hould thus <HI>honour the Lord with our Sub|&s;tance?</HI> Does it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Reproach upon us, who make an high Profe&s;&s;ion, that we expend &s;o little to promote the Knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> among the <HI>Na|tives,</HI> and &s;o much to ill Purpo&s;es? Were what we employ in unnece&s;&s;ary Expences, by which Pride and Luxury are indulged and nouri&s;hed, employed in the laudable Method I am recommending; would it not be &s;ufficient well to &s;upport a Multitude of Mi&s;&s;ionaries among the neighbouring Tribes? Would it not probably be a Means of turning many of them <HI>from the Power of Satan to God?</HI> And would it not be <HI>an Odour of a &s;weet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well plea&s;ing to God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. iv 18</NOTE>? And &s;eeing God, by his Ble&s;&s;ings, has enabled us to contribute to &s;uch a good De&s;ign, &s;hould we not chearfully give of our Sub&s;tance, for the &s;piritual Benefit of the peri&s;hing Heathen?</P>
<P N="2">2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Go&s;|pel, which we, thro' divine Goodne&s;s enjoy, by a &s;tronger Argument &s;till to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">te us to endeavour the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen?</P>
<P>A few Generations back we were in a State of Heatheni&s;m, as they now are: <HI>Aliens from the Com|monwealth of I&s;rael&mdash;and without God in the World</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. ii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>. But, thro' divine Goodne&s;s, <HI>the Day &s;pring from on High has vi&s;ited us,</HI> and we enjoy the Light and Privileges of the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation. Seeing then God has had Compa&s;&s;ion on us, and be&s;towed upon us tho&s;e riche&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, ought we not to have
<PB N="26" REF="007917_0025_102E0129DC9DBEA0">Compa&s;&s;ion on the neighbouring Heathen, and u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours that they al&s;o may be made Partakers of the Light and Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P N="3">3. Should we not be moved to &s;uch charitable Endeavours from the Con&s;ideration of the wretch|ed and forlorn Circum&s;tances, in which the poor <HI>Na|tives</HI> appear before our Eyes? We often behold tho&s;e piteous Objects, appearing half naked, and almo&s;t &s;tarved; which is the Effect of their vicious Way of Living. We &s;ee them al&s;o in the Depths of Ig|norance and Barbarity; wholly unacquainted with the Way of Salvation, and quite unconcerned for their eternal Good: And yet their Powers, both of Body and Mind, are not inferior to our own. Were they brought to Civility and Indu&s;try, they might &s;tand upon equal Ground with us, re&s;pecting the Comforts of Life; and were they in&s;tructed in di|vine Things, made acquainted with the great and important Truths of the Go&s;pel, they might &s;tand as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do. Should not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we behold them in &s;uch mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances? And &s;hould we not exert our&s;elves in all proper Ways for their Help? Did the Wounds of the poor Man <HI>half dead,</HI> who <HI>fell among Thieves,</HI> plead with &s;o much Eloquence for human Compa&s;&s;ion, as the unhappy State of the poor <HI>Natives</HI> does for Chri&s;tian Chari|ty? And if the Compa&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Samaritan</HI> was mo|ved by the former, how much more &s;hould the Bowels of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> be moved by the latter?</P>
<P N="4">4. The noble Example of &s;ome generous and pi|ous Per&s;ons, at Home, may well excite us to liberal Contributions for the Benefit of the poor Heathen.</P>
<P>Not only publick Societies, but al&s;o private Per|&s;ons, in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> have generou&s;ly and liberal|ly contributed for the Benefit of the <HI>Natives,</HI> in this di&s;tant Part of the World. Tho' they are at 3000 Miles Di&s;tance, and never beheld, as we do, tho&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="007917_0026_102E012C44E7EBA0">mi&s;erable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and ge|nerous Spirit, they have &s;ent over their liberal Con|tributions, that the Heathen, by their Means, may be informed in the Way of Life. <HI>Verily, they &s;hall not lo&s;e their Reward.</HI> A noble Example they &s;et before us, mo&s;t worthy our Imitation: And how can we excu&s;e our&s;elves, if we neglect to copy after it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this is not the Ca&s;e of all. Are there not among us ma|ny wealthy Merchants and Traders? Are there not al&s;o many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon the Lands which were, a few Years ago, the Pro|perty of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who now &s;tand in Need of their Charity? Should not &s;uch Per&s;ons be moved, by the generous Examples of others, to help for|ward the noble De&s;ign of converting the Heathen? Yea, are not the People in general able to do &s;ome|thing to help forward &s;o good a De&s;ign? And will it not lie as a Reproach upon us, if we, who make a high Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, prove void of Charity, when we are &s;o loudly called to the Exerci&s;e of it, not only by the laudable Example of generous Be|nefactors at Home; but al&s;o by the peri&s;hing Cir|cum&s;tances of the neighbouring <HI>Indians?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only add my hearty Wi&s;hes, that this <HI>A|merican</HI> Continent, which, for Ages unknown, has been a Seat of Darkne&s;s, and <HI>full of the Habita|tions of Cruelty,</HI> may become a Scene of Light and Love; that the Heathen in it, who have been wont to thir&s;t after Blood, may <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; That the Wilderne&s;s and &s;olitary Place may be glad for them, the De&s;art rejoice and blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e;&mdash;That the Glory of</HI> Lebanon <HI>may be given unto it, the Excellency of</HI> Carmel <HI>and</HI> Sharon; <HI>That they may &s;ee the Glory of the Lord, and the Ex|cellency of our God</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxv. 1, 2.</NOTE>.</P>
