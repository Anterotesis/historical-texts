<HEAD>AN ORATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE honour of being called to addre&s;s you on this occa|&s;ion is &s;omewhat qualified by the con&s;ideration, that the &s;ubject to which our thoughts are naturally directed, has been &s;o often di&s;cu&s;sed, that no new argument can be advanced to gratify the ear of curio&s;ity, and no additional lu&s;tre given to tho&s;e which are already known, to render them more accep|table to hearers of a refined ta&s;te. But, di&s;advantageous as this may be to the &s;peaker, it affords no &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we &s;hould di&s;continue the celebration of this anniver&s;ary. In the cour&s;e of a year, many things occur, to wear away the impre&s;&s;ions which former di&s;cour&s;es may have produced. The zeal which you felt at the commencement of the in&s;titu|tion will gradually cool, unle&s;s renewed and revived by fre|quently pre&s;enting to your view the objects by which it was at fir&s;t excited. It is a circum&s;tance, too, highly encoura|ging, that I am not &s;ent to you with heavy tidings, or de&s;ired to make unwelcome demands upon your charity; but rather to thank you for your former liberality, to congratulate you on the &s;ucce&s;s with which your exertions have been attended, and to point out this in&s;titution as an object of the fir&s;t im|portance to the community, and as highly de&s;erving of your future patronage.</P>
<P>Had I no other purpo&s;e in view but to intere&s;t your affec|tions in behalf of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, I need go no farther than the objects before you. You now behold one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and affecting &s;ights which can be exhibited to the benevolent eye&mdash;the mo&s;t magnificent edifice of the kind
<PB N="6" REF="028369_0004_0FD8A5A16E413790">
of which the new world can boa&s;t, erected on a &s;pot formerly barren and unprofitable, to &s;helter and protect tho&s;e tender plants whom misfortune and adver&s;ity had left expo&s;ed to every rude and noxious bla&s;t&mdash;more than one hundred of your fellow creatures, lately &s;ubject to poverty and want, and ready to fall victims to vice and ruin, happily re&s;cued by your generous interpo&s;ition, and decently clothed, &s;upported and educated by your bounty. <Q>Deprived of every parental aid, you became their guardians; de&s;titute of any abode, you provided for them a habitation; hungry and thir&s;ty, you fed them and gave them drink; expo&s;ed continually to the wiles of the de&s;troyer, you &s;natched them, with an angel's hand, from de&s;truction; in danger of every evil to which idlene&s;s and ignorance could render them liable you employed and in&s;tructed them.</Q> If the recollection of beneficent actions, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of good inten|tions, though defeated by the perver&s;ene&s;s of men, or by tho&s;e untoward accidents to which all human &s;chemes are liable, are a &s;ource of pure and exqui&s;ite enjoyment&mdash;your &s;atisfac|tion mu&s;t be greatly increa&s;ed, when you behold your in|tentions carried into execution, and your labours crowned with complete &s;ucce&s;s. But how mu&s;t the imagination ex|pand with hope, and the heart dilate with joy, when you look forward and behold tho&s;e whom you now protect, enter|ing into life; acting for them&s;elves; filling u&s;eful and honor|able &s;tations in &s;ociety; adorning and improving their country by their ingenuity and indu&s;try, or defending it by their valour; becoming, them&s;elves, the fathers and mothers of families, and tran&s;mitting to their children's children, a portion of that happine&s;s which they have derived from this in&s;titution. In this point of view, you will no longer con&s;ider this hou&s;e as merely an a&s;ylum from pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, but as a nur&s;ery of u&s;eful characters, as a &s;eminary of religion and virtue, as the &s;ource of an incalculable addition to the happine&s;s and improvement of the human race.</P>
<P>It is the nature of charity not to <HI>boa&s;t</HI> or to <HI>envy:</HI> but it is no le&s;s a property of it to li&s;ten with delight to the voice of &s;incere prai&s;e. Without, therefore, &s;ubjecting my&s;elf to the charge of boa&s;ting, or of making invidious compari&s;ons, I
<PB N="7" REF="028369_0005_0FD8A5A7701B5A78">
may affirm, that of all charitable in&s;titutions, tho&s;e which re|gard the education and maintenance of orphan and de&s;titute children, may ju&s;tly claim the preference. God forbid that I &s;hould &s;eek to withdraw your compa&s;&s;ion and &s;upport from the aged and infirm, who&s;e arm is now un&s;trung, and who, declining into the winter of life, no longer di&s;play the blo&s;|&s;oms of &s;pring, or the fruit of autumn! God forbid that I &s;hould endeavour to dry up the &s;ympathetic tear which flows for the &s;orrows of others; to make you deaf to the &s;igh of the afflicted, or render you le&s;s anxious to relieve the &s;ick, and, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice, to &s;mooth the bed of death! God forbid that what is meant to excite charity, &s;hould create a jealou&s;y of intere&s;t, or an interference of claims among in&s;titutions which have one common object in view, the relief of di&s;tre&s;s, the alleviation of human mi&s;ery, in whatever &s;hape it appears! My intention here is to congratulate you on the proper application of your charity; to encourage you to proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e; and to &s;hew that, while other charitable e&s;tabli&s;hments ought not to be neglected, this re|quires and de&s;erves a more than common &s;hare of your atten|tion and &s;upport. <HI>Many of the fair daughters of Charity have done virtuou&s;ly&mdash;but this excelleth them all.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;titutions of this nature may ju&s;tly be &s;tiled more <HI>chari|table</HI> than any other, becau&s;e they relieve greater wretchedne&s;s. There is not, in nature, a more &s;triking picture of weakne&s;s and helple&s;sne&s;s than man in the fir&s;t &s;tage of his exi&s;tence. Some animals are capable of providing for their defence and nouri&s;hment from the moment of their birth: and all, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, are independent of foreign &s;upport. But man, like a tender and delicate flower, mu&s;t be reared with infinite care and attention; and requires, for many years, the fo&s;tering hand of the parent. Happily the natural love of offspring, and the dictates of rea&s;on, combine to call forth the parental a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But when this &s;upport is, by the de|cree of heaven, removed&mdash;when they to whom they were accu&s;tomed to look for bread, are laid in the du&s;t&mdash;when the unconcerned &s;tranger, immer&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, pa&s;ses by regardle&s;s of their di&s;tre&s;s; can imagination figure to it&s;elf a &s;tate more helple&s;s and wretched? The very
<PB N="8" REF="028369_0006_0FD8A5A90C31FE78">
cries and tears, by which alone they can expre&s;s their mi&s;ery, &s;peak more forcibly in the ears of the compa&s;&s;ionate, than the mo&s;t pathetic orator can in their behalf.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;uch has been the &s;ituation of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have been received into this hou&s;e. Some of them have been found wandering in the &s;treets, without father or mother; without friend, except the compa&s;&s;ion of the charitable, and the benevolent providence of Him who is the father of the fatherle&s;s, the &s;hield of the &s;tranger and the &s;upport of the orphan; &s;carcely acquainted with their own names; and truly able to &s;ay, <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but we have not where to lay our heads.</HI> Others have been u&s;hered into the acquaintance of the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers by the di&s;con&s;olate mother, who&s;e tears &s;till flowed for the head and &s;upporter of her&s;elf and her children, and who had addre&s;sed them in the piteous language of the widow of I&s;rael to the prophet of old: <HI>Thy &s;ervant my hu&s;band is dead, and thou knowe&s;t that thy &s;ervant did fear the Lord. Thine handmaid hath nothing in the hou&s;e &s;ave one pot of oil, and behold! the creditor is come to take my two &s;ons to be bond men.</HI> In other ca&s;es, the children have been taken from the bed|&s;ide of their aged, &s;ick or infirm parents, who have thus been &s;pared the heart-rending nece&s;&s;ity of hearing them call for bread, while they had none to be&s;tow; and who have then yielded with le&s;s reluctance to the irrever&s;ible &s;entence of heaven, when they knew that tho&s;e whom they loved, and who would be the greate&s;t lo&s;ers by their death, were not left to wander in the wide world, friendle&s;s and forlorn, but were provided for in this hou&s;e, where there is bread enough and to &s;pare. In &s;hort, others have been found in &s;ituations &s;till more wretched and deplorable: the offspring of an illicit connection, ready to be &s;acrificed to that &s;hame which natural feeling, as well as human opinion, have attached to every deviation from in|nocence; or breathing that noxious atmo&s;phere which infects the haunts of profligacy and impurity, and which infallibly leads tho&s;e who are contaminated with it, fir&s;t, to the lo&s;s of virtue and honour, next, to idlene&s;s and intemperance, and la&s;t of all, to a &s;hameful and untimely end.</P>
<P>In&s;titutions of this nature are not only more charitable in
<PB N="9" REF="028369_0007_0FD8A5AA811661A0">
their origin, but al&s;o more varied and exten&s;ive in their ob|jects. In common with others they have it in view to pro|vide food and raiment, a place of habitation, health and comfort, for tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of them. And &s;o far they de&s;erve an equal &s;hare of prai&s;e and encouragement. But the plan of this in&s;titution extends farther, and pene|trates deeper into the con&s;titution of human nature. It is not &s;atisfied with the removal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of pre&s;ent mi|&s;ery, but provides again&s;t its return, and lays the foundation of future comfort and happine&s;s, by accu&s;toming tho&s;e whom it protects to habits of indu&s;try and application, and by teach|ing them &s;ome art or profe&s;&s;ion, in the pro&s;ecution of which they may acquire a decent and honourable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This in&s;titution, while it relieves outward indigence, likewi&s;e re|moves inward mi&s;ery. It &s;ees the immortal inhabitant of this earthly tabernacle &s;tript and naked; mangled by vice, and bleeding at every pore; bound in fetters by ignorance, and &s;truggling in vain for relief. Like the good Samaritan, it ha&s;tens to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, breaks his chains, and removes his intellectual di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. It pours the oil and wine of con&s;olation into the wounded &s;pirit. It cau&s;es the light of knowledge and in&s;truction to &s;hine into the dark and benighted mind. It feeds the hungry &s;oul with that meat which endu|reth for ever. It gives to the thir&s;ty the water &s;pringing up unto eternal life. It &s;ows tho&s;e &s;eeds of virtue which will bring forth a rich harve&s;t in future life, and will flouri&s;h when all human &s;chemes and in&s;titutions &s;hall have pa&s;sed away.</P>
<P>In&s;titutions of this kind are al&s;o more la&s;ting in their ef|fects. Other charities are confined to the individuals who are the objects of them. This, which regards the young and ri&s;ing generation, extends farther than the imagination can reach: it ble&s;ses ages and races of men which are yet unborn: in the revolutionary cour&s;e of human affairs it may even prove the means of obtaining relief to the children and de|&s;cendants of tho&s;e who are its pre&s;ent &s;upporters, and who wi&s;ely lay up, by practi&s;ing pious and generous deeds, a good foundation again&s;t the time to come.</P>
<P>But the beneficial effects of &s;uch an in&s;titution are by no means to be con&s;idered as doubtful and remote. They are cer|tain
<PB N="10" REF="028369_0008_0FD8A5ABE9A214C0">
and immediate. By promoting the happine&s;s of the&s;e or|phans, you are in fact promoting your own intere&s;t. By &s;aving them from want and temptation, you are depriving the &s;caffold of its victims; you are defending your lives from the dagger of the a&s;sa&s;&s;in; you are &s;ecuring your hou&s;e and property from the in&s;i|dious attempts of the midnight robber. By a religious &s;y&s;tem of education, you improve the national character, and retard the progre&s;s of infidelity and impiety, which are the certain fore|runners of the downfall of that &s;tate in which they prevail. By enuring the&s;e your adopted children to habits of activity, indu&s;try and virtue, you lay the &s;ure&s;t foundation of national pro&s;perity; which con&s;i&s;ts not in any local advantages of &s;oil and climate, or in the abundance of gold and &s;ilver; but in the u&s;eful labour and active indu&s;try of the inhabitants. Na|tural advantages are u&s;ele&s;s when unimproved. Gold and &s;ilver may be con&s;umed and di&s;&s;ipated. But active and in|du&s;trious citizens are a never-failing and permanent national re&s;ource. In &s;hort, by this public mode of education, you form a ho&s;t of patriots and warriors, who know no parent but their country, and owe no debt of gratitude but the ad|vancement of the general weal. <HI>The&s;e are our ramparts,</HI> &s;aid an ancient &s;tate&s;man to one who enquired concerning the for|tifications of his city, and pointing to a band of young men who were educated at the public expence. And I have no doubt every &s;kilful politician will agree with me in thinking, that this hou&s;e, appropriated as it is, to the maintenance and education of orphan boys and girls, is a more effectual de|fence to the &s;tate, than the bulwarks and loud-toned in&s;tru|ments of de&s;truction which formerly re&s;ted on the &s;ame foundation. Of the final &s;ucce&s;s of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, and of the future de&s;tinies and fortunes of the&s;e orphans, we &s;hall predict nothing. But we know that in other countries, where &s;uch in&s;titutions have been of longer &s;tanding, &s;ome who were educated and &s;upported at charity &s;chools, have afterwards become commanders of fleets and armies, have ri&s;en to the higher departments of &s;tate, occupied a &s;eat on the bench, or mini&s;tered at the altar of the Lord. The object of this in&s;titution, it is confe&s;sed, is of a humbler, though not le&s;s u&s;eful kind; being confined chiefly to the
<PB N="11" REF="028369_0009_0FD8A5AD71E43B68">
mechanical walks of life: and I am happy to &s;ay, that the trade&s;men and arti&s;ans of this city, by their numerous appli|cations for apprentices, &s;hew a decided preference for &s;uch as have been educated here, above tho&s;e who&s;e temper, morals and habits of application, have been de&s;troyed by maternal indulgence.</P>
<P>Such being the excellent tendency and beneficial effects of in&s;titutions of this nature, it may not be improper to enquire, for a moment, into the principle from which they originate. It cannot, I think, be denied, that there exi&s;ts in the original con&s;titution of human nature, a principle or feeling of com|pa&s;&s;ion which is excited by the fight of di&s;tre&s;s, and which prompts us to relieve the object thereof. Whether the per|formance of beneficent actions is wholly di&s;intere&s;ted, or is founded on a de&s;ire to e&s;cape from that pain which we feel at the &s;ight of mi&s;ery, or to obtain that happine&s;s which flows from the relief of di&s;tre&s;s, is of no importance in the pre&s;ent enquiry. It is of more con&s;equence to ob&s;erve that this feeling, unle&s;s when &s;trengthened by &s;uperior motives, is but a ca&s;ual and precarious in&s;trument of good. It cea&s;es to ope|rate except in the immediate pre&s;ence, and within the audible cry of mi&s;ery. The inferences and conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on give additional energy and &s;tability to this principle. But after all, it remained an imperfect provi&s;ion for human mi&s;ery, till improved and &s;trengthened by the benevolent &s;y&s;tem of religion publi&s;hed to the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Of this it formed the mo&s;t e&s;sential part, being inculcated as the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing mark of di&s;ciple&s;hip; being &s;upported by motives the mo&s;t powerful and &s;ublime; and being recommended to us by a perfect model of philanthropy and compa&s;&s;ion. In re|lieving the di&s;tre&s;ses of others, we only copy the example of our Great Ma&s;ter, who <Q>found the &s;ons of men as fatherle&s;s children, outca&s;ts from paradi&s;e, in a &s;tate of utter de&s;ti|tution; who opened for them a hou&s;e of refuge, fed them with cele&s;tial food, gave them the water of life to drink, clothed them with the garments of &s;alvation,</Q> and then in|culcated on his followers, this commandment&mdash;<HI>As I have loved you, &s;o ought you to love one another.</HI></P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is &s;upported by fact. In the hi&s;tory of
<PB N="12" REF="028369_0010_0FD8A5AF35D05A18">
ancient times, a few &s;olitary in&s;tances of individual benevo|lence may be met with; but it is from the introduction of Chri&s;tianity that we date the origin of charitable e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. Then benevolence began to operate upon a regular and &s;y&s;tematic plan. Then the rich learnt to part with their goods for the relief of the poor. Hou&s;es were built for &s;uch as had none. Ho&s;pitals were prepared for tho&s;e who wanted a phy&s;ician. And the naked and hungry brethren of Je&s;us were clothed and fed at the common expence of that &s;ociety of which they were members.</P>
<P>The benevolent and compa&s;&s;ionate genius of the go&s;pel is fully apparent in its effects. It has di&s;pelled former ignorance and barbarity; &s;oftened and civilized human &s;ociety; refined and humanized the manners of men; re&s;trained the ravages and cruelties of war; mitigated the &s;everity of puni&s;hment; diffu&s;ed more exten&s;ively civil liberty and &s;ocial rights; and elevated the lower orders of men to a rank and importance in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But in nothing is the humane &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity more con&s;picuous than in improving the &s;tate of children. In the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations of antiquity we ob&s;erve on this &s;ubject laws the mo&s;t ridiculous, and cu&s;toms the mo&s;t &s;hocking to hu|manity. Their legi&s;lators had too much wi&s;dom not to perceive that the youth were an important part of the community; and that, if they did not &s;ow in &s;pring, they could not reap in har|ve&s;t. But war and conque&s;t con&s;tituted the policy of every &s;tate previous to the chri&s;tian aera; their in&s;titutions were all calculated for this end; and barbarous laws counteracted, and often triumphed over, the feelings of nature. At Sparta, the new-born infant was expo&s;ed to the examination of a council of men, the mo&s;t inflexible in their di&s;po&s;itions, and the mo&s;t &s;evere in their manners; and if it had the appearance of being weak and &s;ickly, it was deemed unworthy to live. At Athens, it depended on the will of a capricious and di&s;|&s;ipated father, whether any of his children &s;hould be allowed to live; and as the &s;tate made provi&s;ion for the mainte|nance only of tho&s;e who&s;e parents had fallen in battle, the children of the poor, or unhappy orphans, were for the mo&s;t part con&s;igned to de&s;truction; expo&s;ed in the de&s;ert, to the
<PB N="13" REF="028369_0011_0FD8A5B06BBE93F0">
uncertain affection of the wild bea&s;t, or left in the high way to the mercy of the accidental pa&s;&s;enger. At Rome, the fa|ther's authority over his children was ab&s;olute and unlimited. They could be &s;old into &s;lavery, or put to death at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But Chri&s;tianity has re&s;tored to nature its rights, and to virtue its reign. With the &s;evere legi&s;lators of antiquity compare the mild and merciful Lawgiver of the univer&s;e; who&s;e meekne&s;s of temper and &s;uavity of manners were ac|knowledged even by his enemies; who, in all his actions, di&s;played the utmo&s;t affability and conde&s;cen&s;ion; who, on many occa&s;ions, &s;hewed a peculiar affection and attachment to children; who delighted to have them about his per&s;on; and who frequently exhibited them to his di&s;ciples, as fit em|blems of that innocence, &s;implicity and docility, which ought to characteri&s;e the &s;ubjects of his moral government. <HI>Suffer, little children,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Hear then the &s;um and conclu&s;ion of the whole matter. You, who are the generous patrons and &s;upporters of the Orphan-hou&s;e, have, by your attention to this in&s;titution, &s;hewn your&s;elves to be <HI>charitable men, enlightened patriots</HI> and <HI>good Chri&s;tians.</HI> The catalogue of human virtues fur|ni&s;hes no additional encomium.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of every in&s;titution depends on the wi&s;dom and fidelity with which it is conducted. Upon this principle the Orphan-hou&s;e may rea&s;onably expect all that &s;ucce&s;s of which the nature of human affairs will admit. The ge|neral management and &s;uperintendance of this in&s;titution has wi&s;ely been committed to tho&s;e whom their fellow-citizens have entru&s;ted with the &s;ecurity of their lives and properties, I mean the INTENDANT and WARDENS of this city. To you,</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to addre&s;s my&s;elf with that deference and re&s;pect which are due to tho&s;e whom the voice of their country has inve&s;ted with authority. Our religion teaches us, that they who rule are entitled to double honour; but at the &s;ame time it exhorts rulers to rule with diligence. Re&s;pon&s;ibility is in|variably attached to &s;tations of honour and tru&s;t. If nobler
<PB N="14" REF="028369_0012_0FD8A5B7A641EE18">
laurels are to be gained, greater toil is to be undergone and more danger is to be encountered. By accepting the office which you now hold, you have pledged your&s;elves to the community, that you will di&s;charge the duties thereof with diligence and fidelity.</P>
<P>Among the many duties attached to your &s;tation, none ap|pears more important than a due regard to the proper manage|ment of this in&s;titution. Here you mu&s;t lay the foundation of almo&s;t every other improvement in the admini&s;tration of the police. The education of youth is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting object which can occupy the attention of the rulers of the community. This age is the &s;eed-time of life, and if this is neglected, the con&s;equences will be as injurious, as if the &s;eed-time were left out of the year. As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined. The habits and manners of the youth de|termine the character and conduct of the man. The in&s;truc|tions and exhortations of the mini&s;ters of religion will be delivered in vain, unle&s;s the mind has been previou&s;ly pre|pared for receiving them, by a virtuous education. To no purpo&s;e will you enact laws and regulations for the mainte|nance of good order and &s;obriety, unle&s;s you encourage in the youth, habits of indu&s;try and virtue. In vain do you employ your time and money in cleaning and repairing the &s;treets, if you do not free them from the impurities of vice, and from tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ights which &s;qualid poverty pre|&s;ents. You will have done but half your work, if you con|tent your&s;elves with lighting the nightly pa&s;senger on his way, and &s;till leave the minds of the lower orders of people in the darkne&s;s of ignorance. You cannot beautify and adorn the city in any way &s;o effectually, as by introducing purity of man|ners, and training up the&s;e children to indu&s;try and virtue. The encouragement of this in&s;titution is not only a &s;ublime in&s;tance of charity&mdash;but al&s;o the true&s;t economy, the be&s;t way of hu&s;banding the public money. The more of it that is expended here, the le&s;s will be con&s;umed in the poor-hou&s;e. In proportion as the number of tho&s;e who are benefited by this in&s;titution is increa&s;ed, the expence of guarding your lives and properties will be dimini&s;hed. The patriotic re|publicans of antiquity, lived them&s;elves in mean and incon|venient

dwellings: they di&s;played their &s;plendor and magni|ficence in their public works, and in the temples of their gods. Shew your&s;elves imitators worthy of them; and by your attention to in&s;titutions of public utility, manife&s;t your zeal for the public good.</P>
<P>But while, as far as your funds will permit, you encou|rage and extend this in&s;titution, let it not be forgotten that you will more effectually promote the de&s;ign thereof, if you can find lei&s;ure for per&s;onal attendance and in&s;pection. This will rai&s;e in the children, a &s;pirit of emulation, and a laudable de&s;ire to excel; becau&s;e they will perceive that you take an intere&s;t in their welfare and improvement, and will find them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;hed according to their progre&s;s and good behaviour. This will tend, al&s;o, to excite the diligence and exertions of tho&s;e &s;ervants and dependents whom you employ under you in this hou&s;e. For though the exhibition of this day affords ample te&s;timony of the fidelity and prudence of all concerned in this e&s;tabli&s;hment, it cannot be denied that the pre&s;ent zeal can be kept up only by your con&s;tant and regular &s;uperintendence.</P>
<P>Above all, let it be your chief care to make a wife and di&s;creet choice of commi&s;&s;ioners&mdash;to elect to this important and honourable &s;tation, none but men of known integrity and prudence; men fearing God, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Happily the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances leave no room here, but for prai&s;e and congratulation. Were I not afraid to wound that mode&s;ty and humility which are in&s;eparably attached to great and good characters, I would de&s;cribe minutely, and you would hear with plea&s;ure, the unwearied diligence with which the COMMISSIONERS, without fee or reward, attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of this in&s;titution; frequently to their own detriment, and the interruption of their private affairs. I would call upon the di&s;tre&s;sed parents to declare, how ea&s;y of acce&s;s they have ever found them, and how ready to li&s;ten to their tale of woe. I would teach the&s;e chil|dren to rehear&s;e the many in&s;tances of paternal affection, anxiety and care which they have experienced, and the many proofs of zeal for their intere&s;ts, and of their readine&s;s to give them advice, and even pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their
<PB N="16" REF="028369_0014_0FD8A5BAE868A290">
private fortune after they had left the hou&s;e. In their book of laws, which is open to the in&s;pection of every one; I would point out the &s;alutary regulations which they have e&s;tabli&s;hed for the management of their important charge. I would lead you through the different apartments of this building, and direct your attention to the plenty which reigns there, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> economy which is practi&s;ed, and to the good order which prevails among the children. I would then re|que&s;t you to follow me into the place of their education, and mark the proficiency many of them have made; a proficiency that might well put to the blu&s;h &s;ome who have enjoyed all the advantages which the good fortune of being de&s;cended from rich and re&s;pectable parents confers. In &s;hort, you &s;hould be pre&s;ent at their hours of devotion, and hear with what fervour and zeal, they, every morning and evening, offer thanks to heaven, who has rai&s;ed them up in you &s;uch generous patrons and &s;upporters. There is but one fact, however, which I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h with a particu|lar notice, as a proof of the great attention which is paid to the health, diet and comfort of the children. Out of 183, who have been received upon this e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;ince its foundation, in five years (the term of its duration) only &s;ix have died; making one in 152 annually: a circum&s;tance, which, con&s;idering the precarious period of life, is almo&s;t incredible, and is not to be equalled in any other climate, even the mo&s;t favourable to the health and longevity of the human race.</P>
<P>I have only to be&s;eech you, GENTLEMEN, as you have hitherto de&s;erved well of the community, not to relax in your exertions. Con&s;ider the important tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you. A higher compliment could not have been paid to the vir|tues either of your head or heart, than to commit to you the management of an in&s;titution which requires &s;o much of both. I need &s;carcely remind you of that plea&s;ure which you have &s;o often felt, the plea&s;ure of doing good, the de|light of relieving the wretched. At times, indeed, you will be called to witne&s;s afflicting &s;cenes; but it is con&s;oling to think, that even the&s;e have the happie&s;t tendency to &s;often and improve the heart. In general, you will find in this hou&s;e a
<PB N="17" REF="028369_0015_0FD8A5BC9855EF48">
plea&s;ing retreat from the rougher labours of bu&s;ine&s;s and the more di&s;agreeable duties of your &s;tation. A &s;eminary of children, engaged in the little toils and labours &s;uited to their years; indulging their playful and &s;portive di&s;po&s;itions, and di&s;playing without di&s;&s;imulation or re&s;erve, their hopes and their fears, their loves and their hatreds, their joys and their griefs, is a delightful &s;ubject of contemplation. It is the picture of man's primeval &s;tate, and reminds us of tho&s;e happy days of innocence and peace, which were &s;pent in quietne&s;s under the paternal roof, before we were acquainted with the cares and &s;orrows and vices of the world. Here, &s;eated on an eminence, you enjoy a delightful calm and &s;erenity, while you behold the world beneath you vexed with the din of politics, and wearied with the noi&s;e of folly. Other patriotic deeds may gain applau&s;e, but &s;cenes like the&s;e admini&s;ter comfort. Nay, the applau&s;e which &s;uch works acquire to their performers, though not &s;o loud and noi&s;y, is far more la&s;ting and &s;atisfactory. In the eye of rea&s;on, goodne&s;s ranks before greatne&s;s, and benevolent deeds before the mo&s;t heroic exploits. They confer laurels which never fade, and be&s;tow honours which no breath can bla&s;t. The erection of this edifice will be remembered to the immortal honour of its founders, when the proud monuments of human ambition and folly &s;hall have mouldered into du&s;t; and when the heroes and conquerors and de&s;troyers of the human race, who have filled the earth with widows and with or|phans, &s;hall have &s;unk into oblivion, or are remembered with abhorrence. But this is the &s;malle&s;t part of your reward. Your's are the joys of &s;elf approbation. Upon you &s;hall come the ble&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e who were ready to peri&s;h. When tho&s;e years arrive, wherein the idle, who have wa&s;ted their time unprofitably, and the &s;elfi&s;h, who have employed it &s;olely for their own private advantage, &s;hall &s;ay they have no plea&s;ure, you will be able to recollect with &s;atisfaction the &s;everal events of a life &s;pent in promoting the glory of God, and the good of your fellow creatures. In that hour, when human &s;trength is nought but weakne&s;s, and all the glory of man withers away as the flower of the field, your labours of love in behalf of this hou&s;e, will be to you a &s;ource of &s;up|port
<PB N="18" REF="028369_0016_0FD8A5BDEC78DF58">
and con&s;olation. And in that day of retribution, when the merciful &s;hall obtain mercy, and all the frivolous and hard hearted &s;ons of mirth &s;hall be &s;wept away, as the chaff before the wind, you &s;hall hear with delight this &s;entence of approbation and reward: <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed! inherit the king|dom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink; I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in; Naked and ye cloathed me; I was &s;ick and ye vi&s;ited me; I was in pri&s;on and ye came unto me. For in as much as ye have done it unto the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me. For who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little ones, a cup of cold water only, &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward.</HI></P>
<P>I am la&s;t of all, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you for who&s;e benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;titution is intended. And here much might be &s;aid, were it po&s;&s;ible to clothe my &s;entiments in language which your tender and uninformed minds could ea&s;ily under&s;tand. But, as this is not the ca&s;e with the greater part of you, I &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;ubject with more brevity than perhaps its importance requires.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of you who are capable of judging and feeling at all, mu&s;t, on this occa&s;ion, at the &s;ight of your benefactors, be filled with &s;entiments of joy, gratitude and love. Once were you orphans and fatherle&s;s, but now the&s;e are your mothers and your fathers, your &s;i&s;ters and your brethren. To them ought to be transferred that affection which would have been due to your own parents, had you been fortunate enough to have experienced their kindne&s;s. Perhaps their claim is &s;tronger than that of any natural parent, becau&s;e they were bound by no tie of affection, and they expect no recompence but a proper improvement, on your part, of the opportunities which they have put in your power. The wretchedne&s;s of your former condition, which was not at all dimini&s;hed by the inability of many of you to perceive its full extent, compared with your pre&s;ent comfortable &s;ituation, clearly points out to you how much you owe to the genero&s;ity of the public. Every meal you eat, every time you look to this &s;tately building, de&s;tined for your dwelling, &s;hould call up to your view your kind &s;upporters, and bring the tear
<PB N="19" REF="028369_0017_0FD8A5C4DC6597A0">
of gratitude into your eye. You ought farther to con&s;ider, that even had you been able to &s;truggle through the various ills of poverty, want and di&s;ea&s;e, incident to your former condition, you would &s;till have laboured under the mo&s;t &s;erious di&s;advantages in your progre&s;s through life. Igno|rant and vicious, you could not have ri&s;en to eminence in any &s;ituation. Without friends to patroni&s;e and advi&s;e you, or to introduce you into the world, di&s;couragement and di&s;|appointment would have attended you in every pur&s;uit. But, by being received into this hou&s;e, you have been adopted, as it were, into an honourable family. You are now the im|mediate children of your country, who will not fail to pro|vide for you, if you are not wanting to your&s;elves. You have now friends and patrons, to whom you may look up for coun&s;el and protection. Reflections like the&s;e are &s;uffi|cient to melt the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible heart, and have been often found to reform the mo&s;t &s;tubborn and untractable, with whom puni&s;hment and re&s;traint were of no avail. But how &s;hall you evince your gratitude, and your &s;en&s;e of our kind|ne&s;s? You cannot, in per&s;on, thank every individual of your &s;upporters: and it may never be in your power to make any return. The only way, then, in which you can &s;hew your gratitude, is by a proper behaviour, a diligent attention to your improvement while you are in this hou&s;e; and a grate|ful recollection, after you have left it, of the kindne&s;s you have here experienced, together with a faithful di&s;charge of the duties which may belong to your future &s;tation in life. Thus your benefactors will have the &s;atisfaction to know, that their money and pains have not been be&s;towed in vain; and thus you will confute an ancient objection to &s;uch in&s;titutions, that they who have been educated in them, have generally become vicious and abandoned, when they entered into life, becau&s;e they had no parents and friends to whom they were re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct. In this way you will more effectually benefit your &s;ucce&s;sors, and promote the intere&s;t of the Orphan-Hou&s;e, than by the mo&s;t liberal contribution which &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s might enable you to make.</P>
<P>Upon you, my young friends, are incumbent all the duties which belong to others of the &s;ame age and &s;ex. But I only
<PB N="20" REF="028369_0018_0FD8A5C85E778B98">
mean to mention &s;uch as are peculiar to your &s;ituation. The fir&s;t is diligence and application in whatever you are appointed to perform. Now you mu&s;t lay the foundation of your &s;uc|ce&s;s in future life. While the heart is yet tender, habits are &s;oon formed, impre&s;&s;ions are ea&s;ily made, and le&s;sons of wi&s;dom &s;ink deep into the mind. Tho&s;e golden days, which you now enjoy, will &s;oon pa&s;s away, but they will never return; and whether well or ill employed, they will leave la&s;ting memorials behind them. As you now &s;ow, you will hereafter reap. Remember then that every thing depends upon your own exertions. You have no inheritance but your talents, and no friends but &s;uch as your fidelity and diligence may procure you. The child of pro&s;perity who wa&s;tes the precious &s;ea&s;on of youth in idlene&s;s, only expo&s;es him&s;elf to future contempt and di&s;grace; you thereby expo&s;e your&s;elves to utter ruin and mi&s;ery. Remember al&s;o, that your time is not your own&mdash;that you eat the bread of others&mdash;and that you are, in a &s;en&s;e, the property of the public, to whom you are re&s;pon&s;ible for every moment of your life.</P>
<P>To diligence you mu&s;t add humility, docility and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to your &s;uperiors. The&s;e are qualifications highly be|coming in men of all ages; in youth they are peculiarly ami|able and graceful: but in you, who derive every thing from the charity of others, and who, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would have been outca&s;ts and pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, they are indi&s;pen|&s;ibly requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>Endeavour, likewi&s;e, while your minds are yet &s;u&s;ceptible of tender impre&s;&s;ions, to cultivate generous and charitable di&s;po|&s;itions. <HI>Remember, that ye were bondmen in the land of Egypt,</HI> is an argument frequently addre&s;sed by the Almighty to the people of I&s;rael, when he inculcates humanity and com|pa&s;&s;ion in their dealings with the poor, or with their bond &s;er|vants. And mo&s;t certainly no con&s;ideration is more powerful to excite &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion than the actual feeling of pre&s;ent, or the recollection of pa&s;t &s;ufferings. Remember then, that you were once helple&s;s, friendle&s;s and forlorn; and, though you cannot relieve, be ever ready to com|pa&s;&s;ionate others who may be in the &s;ame &s;ituation&mdash;to weep with tho&s;e who weep, and to rejoice with tho&s;e who rejoice.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028369_0019_0FD8A5C92BAA44B8">The choice of companions is an object of the fir&s;t impor|tance to youth; but this your &s;ituation has not left in your power. On this &s;ubject, therefore, I have only to recom|mend, that you be careful to maintain harmony and concord with one another. It is comely for brethren to dwell together in unity; and brethren, in many &s;en&s;es, you are&mdash;brethren in affliction, as well as by adoption into the &s;ame family. Let all wrath, contention and &s;trife, be put away far from this hou&s;e; and let it be the man&s;ion of peace and brotherly love. Is not the number of your friends &s;ufficiently &s;mall already, that you &s;eek, by unnece&s;sary feuds and conte&s;ts, to make enemies of tho&s;e whom a community of wants and &s;orrows, and habits of familiarity and intercour&s;e ought to have knit to you for ever, and to have rendered through life in&s;truments of mutual happine&s;s and &s;upport.</P>
<P>On a day &s;acred to fe&s;tivity and joy, I wi&s;hed to have &s;aid nothing which might throw a cloud over the fair pro&s;pect which I have held forth to this audience. But I am particu|larly charged to inform you, that repeated, and I am afraid, well founded complaints have been made to the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, of the improper behaviour of &s;ome of you, not only in the &s;treets, but even in the hou&s;e of God; and thus publicly to warn the offenders, that unle&s;s reformed by the ordinary modes of correction, they will be made an awful example to the re&s;t, will be finally expelled from this hou&s;e, and their place &s;upplied by others who &s;hall prove more de&s;erving of the kind &s;upport which they here receive.</P>
<P>In a word, my young friends, while you are careful to expre&s;s your gratitude to your benefactors; to prove by your conduct, that you are not unworthy of their favour; and to &s;hew to each other that kindne&s;s and humanity which your mutual wants and weakne&s;s require, forget not to lift up your minds to the Supreme Being, the author of your exi&s;tence, <Q>the in&s;pirer of all the love and friend&s;hip which have ever been &s;hewn you by others, the &s;upporter of your infancy, the guide of your childhood, the guardian of your youth, and the hope of your coming years.</Q> Let it be the fir&s;t object of all your wi&s;hes and endeavours to obtain his favour; and know, for your encouragement, that they who &s;eek him
<PB N="22" REF="028369_0020_0FD8A5CAD1F2CD88">
early &s;hall find him. Without the ble&s;&s;ing and protection of the Almighty, all hope of happine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s in life were vain: po&s;se&s;sed of the&s;e, you have the be&s;t rea&s;on for tru&s;t and confidence. His arm can give &s;trength to the weak. His grace will enable you to re&s;i&s;t every temptation. His comforts will delight your &s;ouls in the day of adver&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, unite, with one heart and with one voice, in offering thanks and prai&s;e to him who hath hitherto helped us; and in imploring his future ble&s;&s;ing and protection to this in&s;titution, without which all our endeavours will be inef|fectual.</P>

Do thou, who ha&s;t &s;et thy glory above the heavens, and who out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings ha&s;t ordained &s;trength, hear with acceptance the prayer and prai&s;e which are addre&s;sed to thee from this place.</P>
<P>While Angels and Archangels, and the Spirits of the Ju&s;t, behold thy perfections and glory unveiled, we contemplate thee only in thy works.

When we con&s;ider our own nature and &s;tate, we lament our degraded condition; but when we open that &s;acred volume which thou ha&s;t given to guide us into the way of truth, we contemplate with a&s;toni&s;h|ment

Enable us to co-operate with thee in that great plan, which thou art carrying on from age to age, for counteracting the fatal effects of that di&s;order which &s;in has introduced into the moral &s;y&s;tem.

Breathe into our &s;ouls that &s;pirit of charity which is the bond of perfection. May we feel that generous &s;ympathy, which weeps with tho&s;e who weep, and rejoices with tho&s;e who rejoice. Teach us that candour which think|eth no evil. As we expect mercy from thee, may we forgive our neighbour the wrongs which he has done us.
