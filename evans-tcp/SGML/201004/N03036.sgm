<P>_I Had the Favour of your obliging Letter, which was the more welcome, for the Pre&s;ent that accompany'd it.

<P><Q>He begins his Attack with an endeavour to pre|judice his unwary Reader, by branding a Church remarkable for her Indulgence, to Di&s;&s;enters of all Denominations, with the hateful Name of Per&s;ecu|tion.&mdash; Is it not however, a&s;toni&s;hing, that any con|&s;iderate Man, &s;hould furni&s;h his Adver&s;ary with a Weapon, wherewith to di&s;patch him&s;elf? This our Author has effectually done: For has not <HI>New-England</HI> been notorious, for her Barbarities and cruel Per&s;ecutions? Does&punc; &s;he not &s;till continue to per&s;ecute hone&s;t and well meaning Chri&s;tians, Mem|bers of the true Church, by robbing them of their E&s;tates, towards the &s;upport of Schi&s;matical Tea|chers; and does &s;he not yearly impri&s;on their Bo|dies, for refu&s;ing to comply with her wicked and unju&s;t Demands? Again, it will not (I hope) be impertinent, to ask (&s;uppo&s;ing the Truth of the a|fore&s;aid Allegation) if the Di&s;&s;enters ever did &s;uf|fer &s;uch Per&s;ecution from the Church of England, as &s;he has &s;uffered from them? &amp;c. &mdash; Epi&s;copacy they aboli&s;hed, murdered two Arch-Bi&s;hops, defaced, abu&s;ed, demoli&s;hed Churches.

<P><PB N="4" REF="003651_0005_10023C2969DA8210">
Here we have the <HI>Church of England</HI> repre&s;ented in the brighte&s;t Colours, for her remarkable Indul|gence to Di&s;&s;enters of all Denominations. The <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> are painted as the mo&s;t black and barbarous Per&s;ecutors; and <HI>New England</HI> e&s;pecially, as being notorious for her Barbarities, and cruel Per&s;ecutions; and the <HI>Church of England</HI> by her unheard of Suffer|ings, entitled to the Character of the true Church. But what Proofs does he give us of all this? What Evidence have we of any one of the&s;e Facts, be&s;ides the bare Word of a Gentleman, which he may think it unmannerly, for any one to call into Que&s;tion? But I think it would not have been ami&s;s for him, to have con&s;idered his own Rule in this Ca&s;e, that "unauthorized A&s;&s;ertions de&s;erve no Confuta|tion"</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution is &s;uch an unmerciful Violation of all the Laws of Humanity and &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, that nothing can be ju&s;t|ly &s;aid in its favour, who&s;oever are chargeable with it. It cannot be painted in too black colours, nor rendred too odious to the World. It may therefore be worth the while, to inquire into the Ju&s;tice of this Gentleman's Declamation again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, and to con&s;ider how much his Cau&s;e will gain, by the Com|pari&s;on which he provokes us to make.</P>
<P>You can't expect, that I &s;hould give a particular relation of all the Per&s;ecutions we have &s;uffered from the epi&s;copal Party. This would require &s;everal Vo|lumes in Folio. Some brief Hints may be &s;ufficient, to di&s;cover the Mode&s;ty of this Gentleman, in the confident A&s;&s;ertions under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remarkable <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> in this Cau&s;e, fell upon that famous Martyr Dr. <HI>Hooper,</HI> who with &s;eve|ral other eminent Reformers, and afterwards Martyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e, as <HI>Rogers, Latimer, Coverdale, Taylor, Philpot, Bradford,</HI> &amp;c que&s;tioned the lawful|ne&s;s of the Habits, then and ever &s;ince, impo&s;ed upon the Clergy of the Church of England; and was

<P>We hear but little more of <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> in this Cau&s;e, during the &s;hort remainder of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Reign; and one would think 'twere impo&s;&s;ible, that it &s;hould enter into the Hearts of <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> to worry one another, in the bloody <HI>Marian</HI> Reign, when they were all pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Furnace of papal Rage and Fury. But how improbable &s;oever, we have an In|&s;tance of it in this Reign al&s;o.

<PB N="6" REF="003651_0006_10023C2C30EBD1A8">affords a more tragical Story; and gives us an odd Idea of the <HI>remarkable Indulgence to Di&s;&s;enters of all Denominations,</HI> which our Author boa&s;ts of.</P>
<P>Upon the Acce&s;&s;ion of that <HI>Queen</HI> to the Throne, all our Divines that truly hated <HI>Popery,</HI> were for a further Reformation, as Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> proves by many Authorities.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> of the Di&s;&s;enters, p. 43.</NOTE> But the Queen &s;o loved State and Magnificence in Religion, and was &s;o fond of the Rites and Ceremonies, in which &s;he had been educated, that &s;he would hear nothing of it. But in the fir&s;t year of her Reign, procured the fatal <HI>Act of Unifor|mity,</HI> which proved &s;o de&s;tructive to the Peace of the Church, and &s;uch an Engine of Torture, to &s;o many of the be&s;t Prote&s;tants in the Nation. Many that were gaping for Promotions, fell in with the Court; but yet &s;uch was the general Aver&s;ion again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Rem|nants of Popery,</HI> as they were then ju&s;tly called, that four Years after this, Propo&s;als for a further Reforma|tion were brought into Convocation; and voted by the majority of the Clergy pre&s;ent: but rejected by the majority of one &s;ingle Voice of a Proxy.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's</HI> Annals. p. 337. <HI>Neal</HI>'s Hi&s;t. or the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, p. 18<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> From this Time, we are to expect nothing but <HI>Impo&s;itions</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ecutions,</HI> on account of the&s;e &s;crupled and debated Points.</P>
<P>About a Year after this, Anno 1564, &s;undry of the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> meet in London, the London-Mini&s;ters are convented before them, and required upon pain of Deprivation, <HI>to promi&s;e and &s;ub&s;cribe Conformity to the Habits, and likewi&s;e to the Rites of the Common-Prayer, the XXXIX Articles; and the Queen's Injunctions.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype's</HI> An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 419.</NOTE> Many were for Non-conformity &s;u&s;pended and de|prived; and them&s;elves and Families brought to ex|treme Poverty.

<P>The next Year <HI>(1565)</HI> was there a new Citation of the London Clergy, who were po&s;itively required to &s;ub&s;cribe to an ab&s;olute Conformity, upon pain of Contempt. The&s;e Mini&s;ters cried out for Compa&s;&s;ion to them&s;elves and Families, &s;aying, <HI>We &s;hall be killed in our Souls, for this Pollution of ours:</HI> but there could be no Compa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch Criminals; thirty &s;even of them are at once deprived of their Mini&s;try, and ma|ny of them reduced to Beggary, tho' the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> him&s;elf acknowledged them to be &s;ome of the be&s;t Preachers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 211.&mdash;<HI>Strype</HI>'s Annals, p. 463.</NOTE> Thus are the poor People deprived of the Bread of Life; and a great Part of the Churches &s;hut up, for want of Preachers.</P>
<P>Two Years after (Anno 1567) a Congregation of about a hundred Per&s;ons was broken up, the mo&s;t of them taken and committed to the <HI>Compter,</HI> from thence brought before the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> examined, and a great part of them &s;ent to <HI>Bridewel;</HI> where they were kept in &s;trict Durance above a Year, for ab&s;enting from their Pari&s;h Churches, and for maintaining &s;eparate A&s;&s;em|blies for Prayer and Preaching, and Admini&s;tring the Sacraments.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neal</HI>'s Hi&s;t. of the Purit. p. 242.&mdash; <HI>Cotton's</HI> Congreg. Way cleared, p. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>The two following Years, the Eyes of the Court, and of the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> were turned another way. They were alarmed with the Confederacy of the <HI>Popi&s;h Princes,</HI> to root the Reformation out of Europe; and &s;eem &s;omething to overlook the poor <HI>Non-conformi&s;ts.</HI> But in the Year 1570, the penal Laws were executed to purpo&s;e, upon many that were cited to the Spiri|tual Courts; and after long Attendance and great Charges, &s;u&s;pended or deprived; among whom was the famous Mr. <HI>Axton,</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Morton Cobbet,</HI> who
<PB N="8" REF="003651_0007_10023C2F967B3408">was deprived of his Living; and driven to &s;eek his Bread in another Country: And the memorable Mr. <HI>Thomas Cartwright,</HI> B.

<P>In the two following Years (1571, 1572.) notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everal &s;trong Attempts in <HI>Parliament,</HI> for a further Reformation, and for putting an End to the&s;e Per&s;ecutions, they were continued with a Wit|ne&s;s. In <HI>June</HI> 1571, the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> &s;ummoned about a dozen of the chief remaining Mini&s;ters, about Lon|don, that &s;crupled the Habits and Ceremonies; and &s;u&s;pended them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 280.</NOTE> And not long after, were about a hundred other Mini&s;ters deprived, for the &s;ame pre|tended Crime; and two of them were impri&s;oned a Year and four Months in <HI>Newgate,</HI> for pre&s;enting a Petition to the <HI>Parliament</HI> for Relief; and &s;everal others deprived, for &s;peaking favourably of the impri&s;oned Mini&s;ters.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strype</HI>'s Ann. p. 187. <HI>Neal,</HI> from p. 284, to 296.</NOTE></P>
<P>The very next Year (1573) there was a &s;evere <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> of the <HI>Puritans</HI> (as the Non-conformi&s;ts were then called) throughout the Kingdom. The <HI>Queen</HI> publi&s;hes a Proclamation, that all Offenders a|gain&s;t the Act of Uniformity, &s;hould be &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed. In the &s;ingle Dioce&s;e of <HI>Norwich,</HI> were three hundred&punc; Mini&s;ters &s;u&s;pended: by which we may con|jecture what Work was made, in the re&s;t of the King|dom. A Number of Mini&s;ters were deprived; and four of the mo&s;t noted, committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> for re|fu&s;ing to declare, that the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book is, every Part of it, grounded on the Scripture.</HI> New Te&s;ts were devi&s;ed, to en&s;nare the Con&s;ciences both of the Clergy and Laity; by which means, Numbers of each were committed to Pri&s;on, Spies were &s;et upon all that came to vi&s;it the Pri&s;oners, and bring them Relief; and one eminent Mini&s;ter (Mr. <HI>Robert John|&s;on</HI>) died in Pri&s;on, in great Poverty and Want.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> fr. p. 304, to 324.</NOTE></P>

<P>In the two following Years (1577, 1578) it appears, that the <HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> had made &s;uch a &s;carcity of <HI>Prea|chers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that in the large and populous Town of <HI>Northampton,</HI> there was not &s;o much as one <HI>Preacher</HI> left.

And &s;ince that Time &s;everal Laws have been made for the Ea&s;e of <HI>Quakers, Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> with Relation to the publick Taxes. So that I know of nothing, that can free our Author (as to the &s;ub&s;tance of his Crimination) from the guilt of groundle&s;s Slander and Calumny.</P>
<P>It is true, that &s;ome former Laws of <HI>New-England,</HI> which have had the royal Approbation, and are there|fore the <HI>King's</HI> Laws, do intitle the Mini&s;ter, elected by the Majority of the Inhabitants within his Pari&s;h, to the Salary agreed upon by them, to be levied by Rate upon 'em all. If the Majority of the Pari&s;h be <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> their Mini&s;ter has a legal claim to the Salary: but if the Majority be of our Per&s;wa&s;ion, their Mini&s;ter in like manner has the Claim. And what Grounds then can there be for this tragical Outcry? Certainly it is not over-mode&s;t, for a Clergyman of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to exclaim after this manner, when it's notorious, that not only the <HI>Tenths</HI> of their Income are paid by all Profe&s;&s;ions in <HI>England,</HI> to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy: but that the epi&s;copal Clergy <HI>e|very where</HI> exact their <HI>Salary,</HI> from tho&s;e of other Per&s;ua&s;ions, where they can legally do it. This is exemplified in <HI>New-York;</HI> and on the We&s;t End of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> where the Epi&s;copalians are not above a
<PB N="30" REF="003651_0018_10023C0FA4907D28">tenth Part of the People. And thus it is al&s;o in <HI>Mary|land, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>But what makes this Crimination the more extra|vagant is, that &s;uch Regard has been had to the epi&s;|copal Clergy among&s;t us, that in <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Governments, wherever there is an epi&s;|copal Incumbent &s;etled, he is intitled by <HI>Laws</HI> not long &s;ince made, to <HI>that Part</HI> of the Tax for the Support of the Mini&s;try, which is paid by the Mem|bers of <HI>his own</HI> Congregation. And each epi&s;copal Congregation hath power to rai&s;e what Tax they plea&s;e among them&s;elves, for the Support of their Mi|ni&s;ter.</P>
<P>And all mu&s;t acknowlege, that <HI>from the Beginning</HI> our Treatment of <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> coming into the&s;e Parts, has been with an exemplary <HI>Candour, Charity</HI> and <HI>Civility.</HI> Many Years pa&s;&s;ed indeed before the <HI>Church of England</HI> Service or Common Prayer was publickly us'd in the Country: But what was the <HI>Rea&s;on?</HI> Becau&s;e there never was all that while a &s;ufficient Number to form a Congregation, or el&s;e they cou'd never find Clergymen to undertake the Cure of their Souls One or other of the&s;e was the true Rea&s;on. Not, becau&s;e the <HI>Government</HI> forbad or hin|der'd their Setting up the <HI>Epi&s;copal Way.</HI> No; <HI>They</HI> have always had that Regard to the Law of chri&s;tian Forbearance, that they never (as I can learn) gave the lea&s;t mole&s;tation to that Way: altho', it's well known that <HI>New-England</HI> was &s;ought by the fir&s;t Planters as a Retreat from the Impo&s;ition of &s;ome Ceremonies in the Church Service. All along, if any appearing to be Men fearing, God, have offer'd to joyn in Wor&s;hip with the Churches here, they have readily been re|ceiv'd to Communion in &s;pecial Ordinances, notwith|&s;tanding their being in Judgment Epi&s;copal. And in later Times, wherever a number in any Place have been de&s;irous to &s;et up the Way of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> no Interruption has been given to their At|tempts: &s;ave what is common to their Neighbours

<P>Our Author's Endeavours to prove, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Matthias</HI> was not cho&s;en by the <HI>Suffrages</HI> of the Lai|ty, are altogether impertinent; for who ever pretend|ed it?

Tho' the Character of an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> made it nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould have an immediate Call to his Office; yet the whole Chri&s;tian Church, being concerned and inte|re&s;ted in the Qualifications of this publick Officer, they are all con&s;ulted in the Ca&s;e, and have &s;uch a Voice in it, that the Per&s;on when appointed, cannot be di&s;|agreable to 'em.

We grant indeed, that their <HI>Ordinations</HI> are lawful, if he intends no more by their being <HI>lawful,</HI> than that they are <HI>not a Nullity;</HI> and that their Clergy are thereby authorized to admini&s;ter &s;acred Ordi|nances.

I grant, that the Duties and Qualifications of tho&s;e called <HI>Bi|&s;hops</HI> in the New-Te&s;tament and of tho&s;e called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are the &s;ame, becau&s;e they are the Duties and Qualifications of the &s;ame Church-Officer, called by both the&s;e Names.</Q>&mdash;One would think, here are conce&s;&s;ions enough, to put a perpetual End to this Controver&s;y: and I might take the Advantage now to turn his own Argument, from the <HI>&s;afer Side,</HI> a|gain&s;t him. &mdash; Surely he might with as much &s;ecurity to his Cau&s;e, have made <HI>one</HI> Conce&s;&s;ion more, and <HI>granted</HI> that <HI>all</HI> their Pretences to a <HI>Prelacy</HI> in the Church, and for the Superiority of <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> to <HI>Pres|bytery,</HI> are un&s;criptural and groundle&s;s. However, whether he will make this Conce&s;&s;ion, or no, we need not I think be in much Pain about the I&s;&s;ue of the Controver&s;y, after he has granted, that the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> makes no Difference between <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters.</HI> However, he is re&s;olved to hold fa&s;t the Conclu&s;ion, tho' he has given up the Premi&s;es.</P>
<P><Q>But tho' I have grante all this (&s;ays he) yet I hope may, and will maintain, that the Powers of tho&s;e called <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in the New-Te&s;tament, were not the &s;ame, with the Powers of tho&s;e who were

<P>He fir&s;t takes for granted, that the Apo&s;tles found the&s;e Churches &s;ettled with <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> when they con&s;tituted a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try among them, which is &s;o far from evident, that it is not &s;o much as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;The only Account we have of the Apo&s;tles con&s;tituting <HI>Elders,</HI> in any of the Gertlle Churches, was at <HI>Ly&s;tra, Iconium, An|tioch</HI> in <HI>Pi&s;idia,</HI> and (it &s;eems) <HI>Derbe.</HI> Acts xiv. 21, 23.

There could therefore be no <HI>Chergy</HI> &s;ettled, when they ordained <HI>Elders</HI> there.

<P>He again takes it for granted, that the chief or only Errand of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> to the&s;e Churches, was for <HI>or|daining Mini&s;ters</HI> there.&mdash;But was there ever a more chimerical Suppo&s;al, when in all their Peregrinati|ons, we find but one Account of their <HI>Ordaining El|ders,</HI> in any particular Churches; and tho' it be there &s;aid, that they did this in every <HI>Church,</HI> yet it's plain, that it relates only to every Church <HI>there</HI> mentioned, viz <HI>Derbe, Ly&s;tra, Iconium</HI> and <HI>Antioch.</HI> As the Apo&s;tle tells us, 1 Cor. i 17 that <HI>Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to baptize, but to preach the Go&s;pel;</HI> &s;o may it be likewi&s;e &s;aid, that Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to ordain, but to preach the Go&s;pel: that is, <HI>Preaching</HI> was his <HI>principal</HI> Work It appears to have been the u&s;ual cu&s;tom of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> to tarry long enough in a particular Place, to convince them of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and to initiate them in the Faith and Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel; and leave behind them, or &s;end after them the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h them in the Faith, to baptize the new Converts, and to &s;ettle the Mini&s;try among them. For the&s;e Purpo&s;es was <HI>Titus</HI> left at <HI>Crete,</HI> (Titus i. 5.) and <HI>Timothy</HI> &s;ent to mo&s;t of the Churches where the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> had been, as appears by the &s;everal Epi&s;tles of that Apo&s;tle. To imagine therefore, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> vi&s;iting the Churches was peculiarly on the Account of <HI>Ordaining Elders,</HI> is &s;uch a groundle&s;s &s;urmi&s;e as de&s;erves no particular Animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>He further takes for granted, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were properly <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and &s;uch, had the
<PB N="68" REF="003651_0037_10023BE0DE023870">Powers of Ordination and Juri&s;diction committed to them. But does he bring one Word from <HI>Scripture</HI> to prove it?

<P>He tells us indeed (p. 18) <Q>that the&s;e were then commonly called <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> as <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Philippi</HI> is called by St.<HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 25. <GAP DESC="foreign">, your Apo&s;tle</Q> &mdash; But what is this to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> are they any where called <HI>Apo&s;tles?</HI> If not, how came they by their ordaining Power, which our Author makes peculiar to the <HI>Apo&s;tles?</HI></P>
<P>But was <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> really <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Philippi?</HI> How then came the Apo&s;tle to write an Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Bi|&s;hops</HI> of that Church by <HI>Epaphroditus?</HI> It's manife&s;t if he was their <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> he had a Number of others, that were Partners with him, in the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Care of that Church, as appears, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &mdash; Does St. <HI>Paul</HI> him &s;elf call him an <HI>Apo&s;tle?</HI> What is this but trifling with the Word <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> which in its natural and genuine Signification implies any <HI>Me&s;&s;enger</HI> what&s;o|ever; and in this Sen&s;e was applied to <HI>Epaphroditus</HI> in the Text before us, who was the Philippians. <HI>Me&s;|&s;enger</HI> to carry their Bounty to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> as appears <HI>Chap.</HI> iv. <HI>ver.</HI> 18.

<P>The Gentleman has yet a further An&s;wer to give: <Q>Suppo&s;e (&s;ays he, p 25.) that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were now ordained, what Advantage can the Di&s;|&s;enters reap thereby?

<P>He fir&s;t attempts to help out his Cau&s;e by explain|ing the <HI>Que&s;tion;</HI> and tells us (p. 33.) <Q>In order to give a clear An&s;wer to this <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> I will &s;uppo&s;e, that by <HI>E&s;&s;ential,</HI> this Gentleman under&s;tands &s;omething that was <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office;</HI> and what di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others</Q>&mdash; But I mu&s;t tell him, he has quite <HI>Mi&s;taken</HI> my Meaning; and given a very <HI>wrong</HI> Explication of the Word <HI>E&s;&s;ential.</HI> It is <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> to a <HI>Brute,</HI> to have a &s;en|&s;itive Soul; but then it is not <HI>peculiar</HI> to a Brute, nor what di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others: For I think this Gentleman has one too.

The like
<PB N="95" REF="003651_0050_10023BFB1FC7DD40">may be &s;aid of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> being <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t.</HI> For tho' many others as well as they, were capable of witne&s;&s;ing to this Fact, yet they were not peculiarly commi&s;&s;ioned, and &s;ent a|bout the World to be <HI>Evidences</HI> of it: and therefore are not (I think) in the New Te&s;tament denominated WITNESSES of the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> in &s;uch a pecu|liar Manner as the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> are. But it can't be &s;aid of all the extraordinary Qualifications, that were <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tle&s;hip,</HI> that they were thus <HI>pe|culiar</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> It was <HI>E&s;&s;ential,</HI> for In&s;tance, to the very Being of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> that he had a certain Knowledge of that great Fact, upon which Chri&s;ti|anity &s;o much depends; that Chri&s;t ri&s;en was <HI>what</HI> he <HI>had heard, what he had &s;een with his Eyes, what he had looked upon; and his Hands had handled,</HI> 1 John i. 8. Wherefore it was a nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tion, when an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> was cho&s;en in the Place of <HI>Judas,</HI> that he &s;hould be one, <HI>that had companied with the eleven Apo&s;tles, all the Time that the Lord Je&s;us went in and out among&s;t them, beginning from the Bapti&s;m of John, to the &s;ame Day, that he was taken up from them, in order to his being a Witne&s;s with them of his Re&s;urrection.</HI> Acts. i. 21, 22. And in like manner, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> is caught up to the third Heavens, that he might by a &s;ight of Chri&s;t be furni&s;hed for a <HI>Witne&s;s</HI> of his <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 2. compared with <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 17. and <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 17, 18. But then there were <HI>five hundred</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e, that had &s;een Chri&s;t after his Re&s;urrection. 1 Cor. xv. 6.

<PB N="96" REF="003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0">miraculous Gifts, as well as they, tho' not in &s;o great a Degree.</P>
<P>It is fully &s;ufficient to my Purpo&s;e, that the&s;e Qua|lifications were <HI>E&s;&s;entially</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> whether they were <HI>peculiar</HI> to them or not. It is enough, that they could not be <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> without them. Let us but &s;ee their <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> endued with the&s;e Qua|lifications, and thus furni&s;hed to be &s;ent about the World, to be <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,</HI> and I will allow them to be properly <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> in the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office.</HI> But in the mean Time, in vain does this Author plead, that it's evident, <Q>that the&s;e extraordinary Gifts we are &s;peaking of, were &s;o far from being <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> that many Men were endued with them, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad no &s;hare at all in the Mini&s;try.</Q> In vain does he urge, that <Q>if the <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in their being <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,</HI> and the extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Holy Gho&s;t, then the <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples,</HI> who had the extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Holy Gho&s;t and were <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection,</HI> were Apo&s;tles; and the five hundred Brethren, by whom he was &s;een at one Time, were <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI></Q> For who ever pretended, that the&s;e Things were <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> or that they were <HI>the E&s;&s;entials</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Apo&s;tolick Office? It &s;uffices that they were <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tle&s;hip,</HI> which is a quite different Thing.

Thus has he &s;tumbled at the Thre|&s;hold. Thus has he left the Arguments as he found them, untouch't by any Thing he has &s;aid. And thus al&s;o would I leave his fir&s;t <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> were it not for one or two Things that occur under it, that may
<PB N="97" REF="003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0">po&s;&s;ibly be thought worthy of Notice. Particularly</P>
<P>He quotes <HI>Matth.</HI> xxviii. 20. to prove, that the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office</HI> was to continue for ever in the Church.&mdash;But does that Text &s;ay any Thing about the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office?</HI> That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were, in their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> to continue to the End of the World, is indeed manife&s;t from that Text. But then the Que&s;tion is, <HI>how</HI> are they &s;ucceeded? In their <HI>ex|traordinary,</HI> or in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity? If the former, let their imaginary <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> &s;hew us tho&s;e extraordinary Qualifications, that were E&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and we will acknowledge their <HI>Apo&s;tolick</HI> Character. If the latter, I have al|ready proved, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are their proper <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ors;</HI> and he has not &s;hewn us, nor can be &s;hew us, that any but <HI>Presbyters,</HI> are by divine Appointment to &s;ucceed them, in either Capacity.</P>
<P>Another Thing that I could not lightly pa&s;s over, is his evading my An&s;wer to the Arguments, brought from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii 28. and <HI>Eph</HI> iv. 11. <Q>This Gentle|man (&s;ays he) would fain know, how it appears, that <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> are permanently &s;et in the Church, and to continue till Chri&s;t comes: when <HI>Prophets, Evangeli&s;ts, Miracles, Gifts of Healing,</HI> and <HI>Di|ver&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ongues,</HI> are confe&s;&s;edly temporary &mdash;I an&s;wer, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e were not &s;o many di&s;tinct Offices, they are only &s;everal Denominations, conferred on tho&s;e Officers, that were in the Church before.</Q> Now, were this granted, what is it to the Purpo&s;e?

Was not the fame Permanence predicated of the&s;e Offices and Gifts, or (if he plea&s;e) Denominations; as of the <HI>Apo&s;tles?</HI> Let him therefore &s;hew us <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evangeli&s;ts;</HI> let him &s;hew us <HI>Miracles, Gifts of Heal|ing,</HI> and <HI>Diver&s;ity of Tongues,</HI> in their <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and I'll allow 'em to be <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI>&mdash;But I mu&s;t neverthe|le&s;s
<PB N="98" REF="003651_0052_10023CB0C00C0A08">tell him, that this Notion of his, that the&s;e Gifts and Offices re&s;ided in the &s;ame Per&s;on, and that (as he too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oldly a&s;&s;erts) <Q>the Work of an <HI>Evangeli&s;t, Prophet</HI> &amp;c. was common to every Mini&s;ter,</Q> is as fal&s;e as it is impertinent; and is expre&s;ly contra|dicted by the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> him&s;elf, in the very following Words to tho&s;e now con&s;idered, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 29, 30. <HI>Are all Apo&s;tles? Are all Prophets? Are all Work|ers of Miracles? Have all the Gifts of Healing? Do all &s;peak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</HI> No! if we may believe the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in the 27th ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chapter, tho' the&s;e all belong <HI>to the Body of Chri&s;t, they are all Members in particular.</HI> So that either the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> or this Gentleman is cer|tainly in a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Thus I have particularly con&s;idered his fir&s;t <HI>Pro|po&s;ition,</HI> upon which lies all the Stre&s;s of his whole Fabrick; and &s;hewn that it is neither pertinent to his Purpo&s;e, nor true in Fact: and the re&s;t of his Per|formance mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily be a Ca&s;tle in the Air, his Foundation being wholly taken away.</P>
<P>I might indeed have taken a &s;horter Method with this Gentleman; and put him upon the utter Sub|ver&s;ion of this <HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> with his own Hand. For if it be (as he tells us it is, in <HI>p.</HI> 24) <Q>a di&s;tingui&s;hing Part of an <HI>Apo&s;tle's</HI> Character, that he be immedi|ately called and ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf,</Q> it is evident to Demon&s;tration, that none can be ve&s;ted with that Character, but what have that immediate Call and Ordination. And what then becomes of his <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in the <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Office?</HI> unle&s;s he pretends, that their <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are thus <HI>imme|diately called,</HI> and ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. It might be worthy of this Gentleman's Pains, to make Peace between the&s;e two jarring Propo&s;itions, That <HI>it's a di&s;tingui&s;hing Part of an Apo&s;tle's Character, that he be immediately called and ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf:</HI> and yet that <HI>the Apo&s;tles have properly Suc|ce&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="99" REF="003651_0052_10023CB0C00C0A08">in the E&s;&s;entials of the Apo&s;tolick Office.</HI> This certainly de&s;erves Re-con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>Upon the whole, I'll tran&s;cribe for this Gentle|man's Satisfaction, and leave him to apply, Part of an An&s;wer made to the&s;e Demands from the Roman Catholicks. <Q>When <HI>Arius, Ne&s;torius,</HI> and &s;uch like Hereticks aro&s;e, they violently broke out of the Church; and for&s;ook all Communion.

I Am now again called upon to con&s;ider his Argu|ments from <HI>Antiquity.</HI> "Had this Gentleman (&s;ays he, <HI>p.</HI> 45.) <Q>been a little more inqui&s;itive, and not (depending upon the Authority of others) neglected examining the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> an <HI>Apo&s;tolick Father,</HI> he might have met with one a&s;&s;erting the <HI>Superiority</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> by divine Right. To omit the plain and manife&s;t Di&s;tinction he makes between them in every one of his Epi&s;tles, hear what he &s;ays, in that to the <HI>Philadelphians</HI> "For as many as are of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are al&s;o with their <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> Again, There is but one Fle&s;h of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and but one Cup in the Unity of his Blood, one Altar, as al&s;o there is one <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> He compares the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> to the Father, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Trallians.</HI> In his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Magne&s;ians,</HI> he exhorts them to reverence the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> according to the Power of God the Father.</Q>&mdash;Our Author is &s;o quick Sighted, it &s;eems, as to find <HI>Ignatius</HI> here a&s;&s;erting the <HI>Superiority</HI> of Bi&s;hops to Presbyters, by <HI>Divine Right.</HI> But I think there is nothing more plainly di&s;coverable than the direct contrary to this, even from tho&s;e very Pa&s;&s;ages, now in view For,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

<P>I have all along con&s;idered the&s;e Epi&s;tles of <HI>Igna|tius,</HI> as genuine; (which we have Rea&s;on to wi&s;h they were;) becau&s;e I was willing to allow the utmo&s;t Force of this Gentleman's Arguments. Tho', it has been abundantly proved by many learned Men, that they are all &s;purious, or vilely interpolated: The Evi|dence of this is at our Author's Service, when he'll be plea&s;ed to call for it. And thus I have pa&s;&s;ed the Pikes of <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Epi&s;tles; and have given a &s;uffi|cient An&s;wer to all this Gentleman's fine Flouri&s;hes, about the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of depending upon the Fathers, is a &s;imple Matter of Fact:</HI> For it would have been &s;oon enough for his pathetical Harangue, when he had fir&s;t proved from the truly <HI>primitive Fathers,</HI> not that there were then <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in the Church (this is acknowledged on both Sides) But that the&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>&s;uperiour</HI> to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> upon the foot of a <HI>Divine Right,</HI> univer&s;ally profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>However, he has here one Thing more, I will be&s;tow &s;ome Ob&s;ervations upon. I had adduc'd &s;everal <HI>Canons,</HI> agreed on at the 4th, Council of <HI>Carthage;</HI> Upon which the Gentleman ob&s;erves (<HI>p.</HI> 47.) <Q>And what then? therefore Prebyters can ordain! no &s;uch thing.</Q> If he had ca&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t glance on that part of the <HI>Dialogue,</HI> he might have &s;een, that tho&s;e <HI>Canons</HI> were bro't, not to prove Ordination by Presbyters, but that there was not in that day "&s;o great a di&s;tance between Bi&s;hops and Presbyters, as there is now; and that nothing was done without the mutual concurrence of the Presby|ters with their Pre&s;ident": which &s;tands validly col|lected from tho&s;e Canons, notwith&s;tanding his remark. But perhaps my Opponent wanted an Opportunity to introduce that Apo&s;tolical Canon (as 'tis call'd) <HI>"Let a Bi&s;hop be ordained by two or three Bi&s;hops, a Prie&s;t by one Bi&s;hop, and &s;o likewi&s;e a Deacon";</HI> and to let us know

<P>I &s;hall take leave upon this occa&s;ion to de&s;ire this Gentleman's Re&s;olution of one or two Que&s;tions, viz.

And if the <HI>thirteenth</HI> and <HI>nineteenth</HI> Canons are of any validity, whether mo&s;t of the Clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,

<P>I &s;hall only add, 'tis a &s;hameful piece of Conduct in tho&s;e of the <HI>Church,</HI> who call upon us to expre&s;s our Regards to &s;uch of tho&s;e Canons, as they think favour their Cau&s;e; while at the &s;ame time they treat mo&s;t of the&s;e very Canons with the utmo&s;t practical Contempt. Let them lead in a punctual ob&s;ervance of them all, and then we may po&s;&s;ibly think them &s;erious, when they recommend &s;ome of them to our Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>WE now come to his la&s;t <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 48.) <Q>That, &s;uppo&s;ing all the Arguments urged in De|fence of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination,</HI> were inconte&s;ta|bly true; yet modern <HI>Presbyterian Ordination</HI> mu&s;t be null and void."

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;ome time after the foregoing Piece was in the Printer's hand, that we were &s;aluted with <HI>another An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Dia|logue</HI> between <HI>Prelaticus</HI> and <HI>Elutherius,</HI> bearing the Title of <HI>ELEUTHERIUS ENERVATUS</HI> &amp;c. Now indeed I can't b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be of Opinion, that impartial Judges will apprehend, that <HI>Eluthe|rius</HI> in the preceeding <HI>Vindication</HI> has anticipated the greate&s;t part of what is nece&s;&s;ary to be offer'd in Defence of his Dialogue again&s;t this new A&s;&s;ault. However, that the Gentlemen concern'd therein, might not complain of any Neglect, nor have the Oppor|tunity of glorying (as their manner is) "in a Book <HI>never an&s;wer'd,</HI>" a little Pains have been be&s;tow'd in &s;ome Remarks on their Perfor|mance, which are exhibited to the Publick in the following Pages.</P>
<P>It was thought convenient, that the Replications to both the Epi&s;|copal An&s;wers &s;hould be publi&s;h'd under one Cover. But by rea&s;on of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Di&s;tance from the Pre&s;s, we could not expect &s;ea|&s;onably to receive his Reply to this other An&s;wer. Therefore T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e taken the Liberty to &s;tand his <HI>Second</HI> in this Polemick Engage|ment: tho' con&s;cious, I've need to make an Apology for my Offici|ou&s;ne&s;s, in appearing (unask'd) in the Defence of <HI>ONE,</HI> who needs no A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>I hope, the Gentlemen I oppo&s;e, will not be offended at the Free|dom and Warmth of Expre&s;&s;ion I've &s;ometimes us'd; &s;ince it is but in <HI>Imitation</HI> of their own Language. I've in that Re&s;pect cho&s;en to deal with them in <HI>their own</HI> Way, to the End they may more readily be convinc'd of the Abu&s;es and Follies of <HI>their</HI> Way of handling the Controver&s;y, and learn to &s;et a better Example for the future. For if the&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Advocates ever &s;erve Religion, or their Cau&s;e, by the Method and Manner of Writing they've gone into, I &s;hall be one among ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y that evill be very greatly mi&s;taken.</P>

<P><HI>Sect. I.</HI>_THE Compiler (&s;hall I call him?) or the Publi&s;her of this new Work, is pleas'd to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf by the &s;pecious Name of PHILALETHES, <HI>a Friend to Truth:</HI> and if that be his <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Character, we may not be allow'd to doubt but that, when he feels the force of <HI>Truth,</HI> he will &s;hew him&s;elf open to Conviction. Tho' if we &s;hould critically examine the <HI>hectoring Preface</HI> to his Performance, I fear whether there wou'd not be found &s;ome dark Omens of a <HI>contrary</HI> Complexion upon him, in &s;everal invidious Turns he has on the <HI>Editor</HI> of the Dialogue between <HI>Prelaticus</HI> and <HI>Elutherius,</HI> and in the <HI>&s;ecret Hi&s;tory</HI> he gives us of the LAY|MAN'S <HI>Letters</HI> to the &s;uppos'd Rev. <HI>Author.</HI> They &s;erve to give us a Specimen of his Veracity, and a Ta&s;te of his Kindne&s;s to his <HI>Quondam Friends.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman (<HI>pag.</HI> 4.) makes a mighty Stir about an innocent Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s, that one woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a'tho't lay much out of his Way at pre&s;ent: and like a zealous Lover of Truth, very decently taxes him of <HI>a notorious Fal&s;|hood;</HI> appealing to the <HI>Layman's</HI> Letters for Evidence; which are to be con&s;ider'd in the Sequel. Ob&s;erve in the mean time, <HI>Elutherius's</HI> Words are ea&s;ily capable of being
<PB N="2" REF="003651_0068_10023CA4CABE07D0">reconcil'd to Truth, by an obvious Di&s;tinction. The Pa&s;|&s;age is in the 54th page of his <HI>Dialogue;</HI> <Q>I'm &s;ure (&s;ays he) I have no Eyes, if the truly <HI>primitive Fathers</HI> are not all with one Voice in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Scheme. And I de&s;ire any of your Party to bring &s;o much as one of them, that declares <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> to be of <HI>Divine Right</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> &s;upe|riour to Presbytery; within the fir&s;t three hundred Years after Chri&s;t. <HI>This Demand</HI> has been often repeated; but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an&s;wered.</HI></Q> Now the force of the Objection lies again&s;t the&s;e <HI>la&s;t Words:</HI> By which, no Per&s;on of Candour and Capacity cou'd under&s;tand him to mean any other than that this <HI>Demand</HI> was never an&s;wered <HI>really</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfactorily;</HI> whatever has been attempted or <HI>"pretended in An&s;wer to it."</HI> And, as it happen'd, <HI>Elutherius's</HI> Ob&s;ervation was back'd with the Judgment of two very learned <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> Di|vines of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> who&s;e Words this Gentle|man here artfully pa&s;&s;es over in Silence; doubtle&s;s that he might <HI>"blu&s;ter with the greater A&s;&s;urance,"</HI> and cry out of <HI>" notorious Fal&s;hood</HI> and <HI>amazing Confidence"</HI> with the more Advantage. Verily I &s;u&s;pect this was <HI>"de&s;ign'd for Amu&s;ing the Vulgar: "</HI> and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems as if he was re&s;olv'd to begin, as well as <Q><HI>wind up, with Triumph, tho' at the Expence of his Integrity</HI></Q> and Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>This Gentleman here brings in Mr. SAGE'S <HI>Vindication</HI> of the Principles <HI>of the Cyprian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck Age,</HI> as a wonderful Perform|ance; which gives me a fair Occa&s;ion to refer the Rea|der to the &s;everal <HI>An&s;wers,</HI> made to that Author, by Mr. <HI>Jame&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lauder</HI> &amp;c, and I will take the Opportunity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">peat the ju&s;t Cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed on that Book, by an eminent Divine of the Epi&s;copal Communion. <Q>It were not a diffi|cult Task (&s;ays he) to &s;hew, that there are in <HI>the Vindi|cation of the Principles of the Cyprianick Age</HI> a great many FORCED and DISTORTED Quorations out of ancient and modern Authors, for Epi&s;copacy in his Acception of it.</Q> Dr. EDWARDS; <HI>Remains,</HI> p. 275.</P>
<P>In the next place, I ob&s;erve, <HI>Philalethes</HI> (<HI>p.</HI> 5.) brings in Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> as a Champion for <HI>Epi&s;copacy.</HI> To which it were An&s;wer Enough, to &s;ay, if he has a <HI>Richard Hooker</HI> to boa&s;t of, we have a <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> to match him. <HI>The Survey of Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> wears, for ought I &s;ee, as <HI>venerable</HI> a hoary Head, as the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity.</HI> But what I wou'd e&s;pecially remark is, That it appears to me a very <HI>odd</HI> point of conduct in this Gentleman to alledge his Epi&s;copal HOOKER'S <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
<PB N="3" REF="003651_0068_10023CA4CABE07D0">Polity,</HI> and glory in it as a Book "<HI>above an hundred Years</HI> old, <HI>yet never an&s;wered;</HI>" when, if he has ever red it with any Care, he cou'd not but be &s;en&s;ible, that this his applauded Author never declares him&s;elf for the <HI>unalterable Divine In&s;titution</HI> of any one particular Form of Church-Go|vernment: but holds that all our Forms of Government are equally practicable; no one being of Divine Right, in that nature as to <HI>exclude</HI> another. I acknowledge him a Friend to Epi&s;copacy: but far from being a Patron of <HI>this Gentleman</HI>'s Cau&s;e, the <HI>immutable Divine Right</HI> and indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Prelacy, as a <HI>di&s;tinct Order</HI> &s;uperiour to Presbytery, and over a Plurality of Cities and Churches. Here's &s;urely a &s;tumble at the very Thre&s;hold. An unlucky Accident!&mdash;But that it mayn't be &s;aid I impo&s;e on the credulous Reader, I'll give him the &s;en&s;e of two Epi&s;copal Divines upon the Politi|cian: The one is Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> who &s;ays (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 394.) <Q>They who will plea&s;e but to con&s;ult the <HI>third</HI> Book of learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker's</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, may &s;ee the MUTABILITY of the Form of Church Go|vernment largely a&s;&s;erted, and <HI>fully proved.</HI></Q>&mdash;My other Witne&s;s is Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> who&s;e words are (<HI>Remains,</HI> p. 257.) <Q>The judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> holds, that <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> may be ABROGATED: and con&s;equently is not of Divine and A|po&s;tolical Right, but is the Political In&s;titution of the Church.</Q>&mdash;Now, if the&s;e be the Principles, that Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> defends (as our Adver&s;ary &s;ays) <Q><HI>with &s;uch &s;trength of Rea&s;on and clear Evidence, that nothing but Ob&s;tinacy can with&s;tand;</HI></Q> I mu&s;t have Leave very much to wonder what &s;ort of Metal tho&s;e Gentleman's Forheads are made of, that dare in Contradiction to their admired <HI>judicious</HI> HOOKER, a&s;&s;ert <HI>Dioce&s;an Prelacy</HI> as the <HI>invariable</HI> Form of Church Go|vernment by <HI>Divine</HI> In&s;titution. "<HI>On this Account</HI> (to allude to this Writer's own Remark) <Q><HI>it is ju&s;tly thought, by &s;ome in|genious Men, a needle&s;s Wa&s;te of Time and Labour, to give new An&s;wers and Replies to &s;uch Objections, as have been &s;o fully an&s;wered</HI></Q>&mdash; by Presbyterians, and &s;o effectually &s;u|per&s;eded even by that learned Epi&s;coparian. <Q><HI>But yet for the Satisfaction of &s;ome, that may be &s;tumbled, upon reading this doughty Performance</HI></Q> of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> it may be of Ser|vice to be&s;tow a few Remarks upon the principal Contents of the <HI>Dialogue</HI> he has fram'd between <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &amp; <HI>Eleutherius.</HI></P>

<P>I think now the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s in&s;tructive Apologue tallies very well with <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s diverting Fable of the <HI>Blood-Pudding</HI> (VINDIC. p. 43.) and &s;erves to give Countenance to it; how|ever ludicrous an A&s;pect it may have in &s;o &s;erious an Argu|ment.

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VII. A &s;hort Interlude happens next. The Debate between <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> and <HI>Elutherius</HI> being now interrupted, we have <HI>Philalethes</HI> taking a Turn in the controver&s;ial Conver&s;a|tion (<HI>p.</HI> 22, 23.) But I mu&s;t beg this Gentleman's Pardon, if I ob&s;erve, his Head &s;eems, like <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s, to have grown <HI>giddy,</HI> upon their Voyage for Epi&s;copal Orders: <HI>which</HI> makes him &s;tumble too on plain Ground; he al&s;o forgets what Part of the World he's now in, and that all Arguments don't alike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute every Climate.</P>
<P>We'll for once allow him his Plea, <Q><HI>That the Church of Chri&s;t has Power to make Orders and Rules, for Regulating its Di&s;cipline, and pre&s;cribing how her Clergy &s;hall be admitted</HI> &amp;c.</Q> But what's this to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e? Or what Advantage will he get by it? I beg this <HI>Gentleman</HI> to inform me, <HI>what</HI> Church of Chri&s;t it is, that has interpos'd her Authority to make <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> for us in <HI>New England.</HI> He well knows, that the <HI>Act of Uniformity</HI> is limited, and do's not extend to the <HI>Plantations:</HI> So that we lie <HI>without</HI> the Pale of the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd</HI> national Church. He well knows al&s;o, that in &s;everal of the&s;e Charter-Government, the Civil Powers have given their highe&s;t Countenance, by rea&s;onable Laws and Orders, to the Mini&s;try and Di&s;cipline of the <HI>New England</HI> Churches: and have not our Province-Laws receiv'd the <HI>Royal</HI> Sanction! If there be any thing then in <HI>his Plea,</HI> that affects the Controver&s;y before us, it will turn out in <HI>our</HI> favour: and he mu&s;t be oblig'd to relinqui&s;h the Pretence. I may borrow &s;ome of the Words of Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> and apply them to the Occa&s;ion: <Q>This Argument therefore mu&s;t be quitted; and they who will defend the <HI>pre&s;ent Se|paration,</HI> mu&s;t return to the <HI>old Principles</HI> of the <HI>Separati&s;ts,</HI> if they will ju&s;tifie their own <HI>Practices.</HI> And &s;o I find Mr. <HI>Philalethes</HI> is forced to do: for di&s;cerning that the Pretence of" Church-Power and E&s;tabli&s;hments "wou'd not hold of it &s;elf, he adds more Weight to it,</Q> and calls in the Help of <HI>Jus Divinum,</HI> which <Q>comes home to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and brings us to the old Point of defending the <HI>Calling of our Mini&s;try.</HI></Q> [Unrea&s;. of <HI>Sep.</HI> p. 118.] &mdash; The

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VIII. Here (p. 24.) we find <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> undertaking to <Q><HI>examine the mo&s;t weighty Arguments of</HI> Elutherius in his Dia|logue, <HI>again&s;t the Epi&s;copal Con&s;titution, and in Ju&s;tification of of the Presbyterian Scheme.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument he pitches on, is what <HI>Elutherius</HI> occa|&s;ionally &s;ugge&s;ted (<HI>Dial.</HI> p. 5.) That <Q><HI>a Prelate at be&s;t is but a human Creature, and not of Chri&s;t's Appointing.</HI></Q> This indeed was de&s;ign'd more immediately again&s;t the <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> and Juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hops. But <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> (p. 26.) &s;ays <Q><HI>Tis certain it was de&s;ign'd for a Slur upon Epi&s;copal</HI> ORDINATION;</Q> and makes a mighty Improvement of the harmle&s;s Pa&s;&s;age, in&s;inuating, as if <HI>Elutherius</HI> intended to argue, that <Q><HI>a Bi&s;hop or Prelate can have no Power to</HI> Ordain; <HI>becau&s;e being a mere</HI> humane <HI>Creature him&s;elf, he can't make a</HI> Divine <HI>one,</HI> i. e. <HI>a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Upon which he exclaims, <HI>If</HI> Eleu|therius <HI>&s;trikes thus high, he will</HI> UNDO <HI>us all,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Now in An&s;wer to the&s;e Remarks, I'll attempt two Things&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. To point out &s;everal <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> in which <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Propo|&s;ition may be &s;afely under&s;tood, and in which it mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd to be <HI>true.</HI></P>
<P>Here let it be ob&s;erv'd, the Prelate &s;poken of is of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stamp, a <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hop; and now I &s;ay, <HI>this</HI> Prelate at be&s;t is but a human Creature, as deriving his whole Power from <HI>human</HI> Con&s;titutions, having no external Juri&s;diction but what he derives from the <HI>State,</HI> &amp; dependent upon the <HI>Crown</HI> for his very Being. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World:</HI> So I may &s;ay of Prelacy, <HI>We know</HI> it <HI>is nothing in the World,</HI> in point of Divine Right. Ju&s;t as our Author (I hope) would &s;ay of the Romi&s;h <HI>Papacy,</HI> it is at be&s;t a mere human Creature; &s;o &s;ay we of Engli&s;h <HI>Prelacy:</HI> which is ma|nife&s;tly founded upon, and directed and limited by the Laws of the Nation. Some of the be&s;t Defenders of Epi&s;copacy have
<PB N="22" REF="003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038">acknowledg'd, there's no &s;uch Thing as a &s;trictly <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Pre|late to be found in <HI>Scripture:</HI> and if this Prelatical Power be not from the Laws of God, it mu&s;t derive from the Civil Magi&s;trate and Laws of the State. <Q>And indeed what is it (as one ob&s;erves) that the Civil Magi&s;trate may not do in the making of a Prelate in the Church of <HI>England?</HI> He may <HI>elect</HI> the Per&s;on, and does &s;o in Reality; for he nominates authoritatively. He may <HI>multiply</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>ad libitum;</HI> and if he plea&s;es, may appoint one in every Pari&s;h. He may al&s;o <HI>delegate</HI> the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> to whom he plea&s;es: for the <HI>Lay-Chancellors,</HI> who judicially excom|municate or ab&s;olve, have their Commi&s;&s;ion to do it from the <HI>King,</HI> not from the Bi&s;hop; and in &s;ome places the E|pi&s;copal Juri&s;diction is re&s;erved to a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> as in the <HI>Peculiars,</HI> they have in divers Parts of <HI>England:</HI> A certain Proof, that the Bi&s;hop's Juri&s;diction is only by human Right. La&s;tly, the Civil Magi&s;trate may al&s;o <HI>depo&s;e</HI> and deprive Bi&s;hops, when they &s;ee ju&s;t Cau&s;e: and this Power has been &s;o lately exerted, that it needs no further Proof. I would fain know whether the <HI>deprived Bi&s;hops</HI> were not dive&s;ted of <HI>all</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction. That which induces me to mention this is, I find the Defenders of the Hierarchy confidently a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>there can be but one Bi&s;hop</HI> in one Church at the &s;ame time: therefore if the former were <HI>not dive&s;ted of their Power,</HI> I &s;ee not how the &s;ucceeding Incumbents <HI>could have any</HI> by their own Rule; and &s;o <HI>their Ordinations</HI> would be <HI>null,</HI> if the <HI>others</HI> be <HI>valid.</HI> To &s;ay, that the depriv'd Prelates had the <HI>Power</HI> &s;till, but were re|&s;trained from the Exerci&s;e of it, would be to confront the Act of <HI>Parliament</HI> [in the Ca&s;e of the Bi&s;hops depos'd at the Revolution] which &s;ays expre&s;ly, they are deprived of <HI>their Office,</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hes betwixt being <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> from the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of their Office, and being <HI>deprived</HI> of the <HI>Office</HI> it &s;elf.&mdash;Upon the whole matter I think it is clear enough, that the Engli&s;h Prelacy is a <HI>meer Creature</HI> of the <HI>Civil Ma|gi&s;trate,</HI> who may make every <HI>Par&s;on</HI> of a Pari&s;h a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> if he plea&s;es; their whole Power (as di&s;tinct from Presbyters) being founded upon the Laws of the Land.</Q> &mdash; Thus the learned Mr. <HI>Tong,</HI> in his ingenious Defence of Mr. <HI>H's En|quiry</HI> (p. 53, to 60.) where this grand Point is largely argu'd, and Objections an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will tend more to <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Conviction, if I produce one of his <HI>own Authors.</HI> This therefore I will do,
<PB N="23" REF="003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038">and I pitch upon Bp. <HI>Hoadly;</HI> who in his elaborate. Argu|ment on the Ca&s;e of the <HI>depriv'd Bi&s;hops,</HI> upon the glorious Revolution (&s;ee Bp. of <HI>Bang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI>'s PRESERVATIVE, p. 9. &amp;c. p. 33, &amp;c.) furni&s;hes us with a fair Key (very nigh the &s;ame with that of Mr. <HI>Tong</HI>) to that my&s;tical Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Elutherius.</HI> He has learnedly demon&s;trated, that the Bi&s;hops <HI>Right</HI> of executing their Office ari&s;eth from an <HI>human</HI> Original, i. e. the <HI>Nomination</HI> of the Civil Magi&s;trate. <Q>This Nomination (&s;ays he) is ve&s;ted in the <HI>Crown</HI> by the <HI>Laws:</HI> and is ultimately re&s;olv'd into the &s;upreme Authority of the <HI>Nation:</HI> Con&s;equently, therefore, what is <HI>given,</HI> may be <HI>taken away,</HI> by the <HI>&s;ame Authority</HI> &amp;c." And it's remarkable "The words of the <HI>Act</HI> (&s;ays he) declare them [i. e. the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> deprived] to be <HI>depriv'd</HI> from their OFFICES, as well as their Dignities" &amp;c.&mdash; And therefore it was "A <HI>total</HI> Deprivation, and made them <HI>cea&s;e to be Bi&s;hops,</HI> as to any RIGHT (properly &s;o called) of executing their Offices.</Q> Now my Remark upon it is, That this plainly argues an <HI>Engli&s;h Prelate</HI> in Effect to be (in <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s terrible Lan|guage) <HI>at be&s;t but a human Creature;</HI> It &s;hows, that Prelacy is in the Eye of the Civil Magi&s;trate, and in Fact and Practice, but an accidental human Creation only. This is a Conclu&s;ion, that &s;eems to me to follow from the Premi&s;es, as naturally and clearly as Light from the Sun. However at lea&s;t it ap|pears evident "beyond the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Reply"(to u&s;e a High Church Phra&s;e) that an Engli&s;h Prelate at the <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> that is, a <HI>depriv'd Bi&s;hop,</HI> is even at the be&s;t but a human Crea|ture; unable, if he has any <HI>latent</HI> Power, to put it in Ex|erci&s;e, or perform any regular and (and in the Eye of the Law) valid Act of Authority, in point of Ordination or Juri&s;diction. And <HI>if &s;o,</HI> I fear me, this STRIKES HIGH indeed, and ca&s;ts an odious Reflection &s;omewhere, even upon <HI>Ordi|nations.</HI> Now let <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> turn the Fury of his &s;evere Re&s;ent|ments from <HI>Elutherius,</HI> and fall foul on his own Advocate the Bi&s;hop, for "<HI>de&s;igning to ca&s;t a</HI> SLUR <HI>upon Ordinations,</HI> upon <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Ordinations" too (which it verily &s;eems he has done in fact) and that the blacke&s;t of Slurs, upon &s;ome of 'em; even "the infamous Blot of <HI>U&s;urpation</HI> without a true Right."</P>
<P>But further I will lay before <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> one Con&s;ideration, that may &s;erve as an <HI>Argumentum ad hominem,</HI> upon the Point we have in hand. I conclude, this Gentleman him&s;elf will confe&s;s, that an Engli&s;h <HI>Prelate</HI> is at be&s;t but a mere <HI>human Creature,</HI> if it can be prov'd he has no authentick <HI>Epi&s;copal

Now that there was in fact &s;uch a <HI>Breach,</HI> even at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> I vouch in an <HI>Epi&s;copal Author</HI> for my Witne&s;s; who&s;e Authority, Argument and Advice may have &s;ome Weight with this Gentleman.

<Q><P><HI>God</HI> is ju&s;t, and equal, and good: and, as &s;ure as He is &s;o, He cannot put the Salvation and Happine&s;s of <HI>any Man,</HI> upon what He him&s;elf hath put it out of the Power of <HI>any Man</HI> upon Earth, to be intirely &s;atisfied in.</P>
<P>It hath not plea&s;ed God, in his <HI>Providence,</HI> to keep up any Proof of the <HI>lea&s;t Probability,</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> POSSIBILITY, of a <HI>Regular Uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> But there is a great Appear|ance, and humanely &s;peaking, a <HI>Certainty</HI> of the Contrary; that this <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> hath been often <HI>interrupted:</HI> e&s;pecially in the Opinion of THOSE, who maintain all <HI>Lay-Bapti&s;ms,</HI> and all Offices performed by Per&s;ons, that either have been <HI>irregularly ordained,</HI> or have <HI>forged</HI> their Preten&s;ions to Ordi|nation, to be more NULLITIES: there having been cer|tainly a <HI>great Number</HI> of &s;uch like In&s;tances.</P>
<P>Among&s;t <HI>our &s;elves</HI> particularly, the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> will admit of another <HI>Argument;</HI>&mdash;It is very well known that, ever &s;ince the <HI>Reformation,</HI> there hath been a Regular <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> kept up, certainly in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and probably in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, by the Church of ROME.&mdash;It is as well known, that &s;everal of the fir&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hops</HI> were named by the <HI>Lay-Power,</HI> as <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who were deprived &s;olely
<PB N="40" REF="003651_0087_10023C65878ED850">by that <HI>Lay-Power.</HI> Nor can there be any <HI>Regular Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ion</HI> in the <HI>Prote&s;tant Churches,</HI> but what mu&s;t come down from <HI>tho&s;e</HI> Bi&s;hops; whom yet our <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> mu&s;t <HI>deny</HI> to have been <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> upon the Account of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <HI>Lay Deprivations.</HI></P>
<P>Ask our <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> therefore, fir&s;t, What &s;hou'd we have done, upon <HI>their</HI> Principles, for any Degree of <HI>Reformation?</HI> &mdash; To have it from any <HI>Hands</HI> but theirs [the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Bi|&s;hops and Clergy] will, I fear, upon <HI>their</HI> [High Church] Principles, give a <HI>Nullity</HI> to the whole: As this cannot be done, without &s;etting up <HI>Altar</HI> again&s;t <HI>Altar,</HI> and one <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> again&s;t <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>Ask them, how we &s;hall decide the Matter (not between <HI>our &s;elves</HI> and <HI>them,</HI> but) between their MUCH DEARER Friends, the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> and <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</HI> &mdash; I have never heard yet, that this <HI>pre&s;ent Popi&s;h</HI> Church, in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> hath been condemn'd by our <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> as NO <HI>Church,</HI> and all its <HI>Ordinances</HI> declared NULL; and its <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> irregular or in&s;ignificant. And yet, upon <HI>their</HI> Prin|ciples, if the Appointment of <HI>Romi&s;h Bi&s;hops</HI> here be <HI>Regular;</HI> there cannot be <HI>Another,</HI> in <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to it, <HI>Regular</HI> like|wi&s;e. If the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Church here, be a <HI>Church;</HI> then, the&s;e new Prote&s;tant <HI>Churches</HI> cannot be truly &s;o, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Advocates</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> therefore, are &s;o wi&s;e, as to turn the&s;e Principles of &s;ome <HI>profe&s;s'd Prote&s;tants</HI> to their own Account; and delude many weak Minds, of &s;uch as have been fir&s;t deluded by our <HI>Nonjurors.</HI>&mdash;All this may, methinks (as he goes on, <HI>p.</HI> 87, 88.) &s;erve to alarm our <HI>Ad|ver&s;aries,</HI> upon <HI>their own Principles,</HI> about the Danger, <HI>their own Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is in, by <HI>their way of Proceeding.</HI> And perhaps <HI>They,</HI> who &s;eem to have but a very <HI>faint Notion</HI> of the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> any farther than they &s;uppo&s;e them to go, hand in hand, with <HI>their own</HI> particular <HI>Sect,</HI> and Church, may receive the fir&s;t.

<P>And as I am &s;ure (&s;ays he, <HI>p.</HI> 98.) that it is <HI>upright</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> to &s;peak thus plainly; and to inculcate this upon <HI>You:</HI> So I am as &s;ure, it is the only certain Method of preventing, or expelling the POISON of <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who are <HI>gone out from us, becau&s;e they were not of us.</HI></P></Q>

Thus the very Bi&s;hop, that <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> ju&s;t now made his <HI>Ap+peal</HI> to, has turn'd all his own Artillery again&s;t him and his Party: and verily they had need have Backs of Steel, as well as Faces of Bra&s;s, to bear &s;uch a &s;courge, and &s;tand it out after &s;o &s;evere a whipping. The Bi&s;hop, you &s;ee, has laid down <HI>Premi&s;es,</HI> and drawn <HI>Conclu&s;ions,</HI> which <HI>&s;trike</HI> as <HI>high,</HI> and as deep too, as that hated Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s; at which this Gentleman &s;tarted, &amp; made the fearful Exclamation, "<HI>Eluthe|rius</HI> will UNDO US ALL." I may &s;urely return him his own words (<HI>p.</HI> 27.) and let him &s;ee how he likes them, coming from <HI>my</HI> hand: <Q><HI>You have</HI> NULL'D <HI>all</HI> LAY-<HI>Ordinations, and &s;uch as</HI> DERIVE <HI>from them; and pray look into that Affair a little critically, and &s;ee if this be not your</HI> OWN <HI>Ca&s;e.&mdash; You &s;ee what mu&s;t be your own Fate;</HI></Q> upon &s;ubmitting the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute to the Deci&s;ion of your cho&s;en Epi&s;copal Umpire.

<P>In the Language of this celebrated <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (who, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve by the way, &s;eems to have alter'd his Judgment in the&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, &s;ince he manag'd his Controver&s;y with Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters) I go on, and under his Authority, I venture to accu&s;e <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> and his Party, <Q>Not merely of a <HI>Here&s;y</HI> again&s;t <HI>Charity,</HI> as they do the DONA|TISTS, who had only ju&s;t the SAME <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s,</HI> of adhe|ring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Con&s;equences of their own Principles; But, of a <HI>Here&s;y</HI> even again&s;t the very <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; or of holding that, which throws Men out of the Favour of God, which way &s;oever they act.</Q> But I mu&s;t re&s;ign the&s;e anomalous Epi&s;copalians to the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> him&s;elf, for the <HI>making out</HI> this Accu&s;ation; which he does at large, in too many Pages to be here recited.

<P>I have dwelt the longer on this Part of <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Argument; becau&s;e if he be &s;poil'd of the <HI>main</HI> piece of his Armour, we may &s;afely leave him to work all his other Engines, as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>I might fairly now withdraw my hand from the Table, and venture the Re&s;t of our Author's Dialogue, with his Friend's Letters annex'd, to try their Fortune.

<P><HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Con&s;truction of that Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>He that is chief</HI> &amp;c. is again&s;t the whole Stream of Prote&s;tant Writers; who con|&s;tantly apply this Text in Oppo&s;ition to the u&s;urped Supre|macy of <HI>Rome:</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> do's &s;o in particular.

In which Remarks, <Q><HI>my Aim is to di&s;cover</HI> this Gentleman's <HI>Mi&s;take by what is call'd</HI> REDUCTIO <HI>ad</HI> AB|SURDUM;</Q> and to caution him, that he be not found at la&s;t in the Tents of <HI>Rome,</HI> whither his Argument has &s;o pal|pable and direct a Tendency.&mdash; It puts me in Mind of a remarkable admonitory Pa&s;&s;age in a Letter of Bi&s;hop HALL'S to (Archbi&s;hop) LAUD: <Q>God crieth (&s;ays he) with <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">;</HI> WHO <HI>is on my Side?

<P>It's hardly worth while to make any Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Eu|&s;ebius</HI>'s learned Management of the Argument (<HI>page</HI> 50, 51.) where he is <HI>"trying the matter in another Light."</HI> For as to the Doctrine a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Elutherius</HI> (Dial. <HI>p.</HI> 38.) <Q>That the Chri&s;tian Church being founded on Chri&s;t'. <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> there cou'd be no <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> nor indeed <HI>Members</HI> of this Church, before it had a Being;</Q> He has the Happine&s;s to be able <HI>to</HI> produce good Epi&s;copal Authorities for it. Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> is fully in the Opinion: See <HI>Irenicum,</HI> p. 210,&mdash;218&mdash;So Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> (Serm. on <HI>Act.</HI> 2.42.) tells us, <Q>That the Di&s;ciples, when Chri&s;t admini&s;tred the Supper to them, were not then in Orders, but were <HI>Laymen;</HI> for (&s;ays he) it was before our Lord's <HI>Death,</HI> and he did not <HI>ordain</HI> them till after his <HI>Re&s;urrection.</HI></Q>&mdash;This is enough to &s;hew that Elutherius's Doctrine is no peculiar <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Tenet: and therefore whatever Conclu&s;ions <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> pretends to draw from it, they can no more be turn'd to the Prejudice of our Cau&s;e, than of his own.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone thro' the <HI>Dialogue</HI> betwen <HI>Eu&s;ebius &amp; Elu|therius;</HI> be&s;towing all the Remarks, that cou'd be tho't needful: and mu&s;t &s;ay upon the whole, I believe, every judicious and un|prejudic'd Reader will ea&s;ily concur with me in this Reflection, That <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Conference has very little an&s;wer'd the <HI>Title</HI> given it; for ELUTHERIUS appears as yet in &s;ound Health and Vigour, free from all perceivable Symptoms of ENERVATION: and need be in no <HI>Ha&s;te</HI> to fly this redoubted Champion.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XIV. I ob&s;erve, <HI>Philalethes</HI> is &s;en&s;ible (by what he &s;ays in the <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> p. 53.) that <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> had made many <HI>Omi&s;&s;ions</HI> in his Examination of <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Dialogue (only <HI>nibbling</HI> at a few Pa&s;&s;ages here and there) and therefore for a further An|&s;wer to it, refers his Friend <HI>Attalus</HI> to the LETTERS <HI>he had lent him.</HI>&mdash;But what need of tho&s;e Letters to &s;atisfy <HI>Attalus,</HI> when <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Arguments in the Conference had &s;o &s;atisfactorily &s;olv'd all his Scruples, and pour'd in upon him &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible Conviction; as to engage him in&s;tantly in the Re&s;olution of <HI>"returning to his Pari&s;h-Church"</HI> without any more Adoe, and to tran&s;port him &s;uddenly into the Height of Bigotry!&mdash;Truly it looks, I mu&s;t profe&s;s, very <HI>odd</HI> and ridiculous, to make the Conference &s;hut up with &s;o &s;urprizing an <HI>Epilogue.</HI> Nor wou'd I give a Fig for a Thou&s;and &s;uch

<P>I find but one Thing further, that de&s;erves any Notice; and that is an OBSERVATION <HI>Philalethes</HI> merrily &s;ugge&s;ts by way of Banter (<HI>p</HI> 54) which yet &s;ome may think is in <HI>part</HI> too true to make a Je&s;t of. The Gentleman here &s;eems indeed to have &s;truck upon one of the cardinal Di&s;tempers of his Church's Con&s;titution; namely, SIMPLE <HI>Presbyters,</HI> &s;tript of the u&s;eful mini&s;terial Powers of Ordination and Government, to furni&s;h <HI>dignify'd Officers</HI> with an <HI>overgrown</HI> Power, of little Significance to the main Ends of the Mini&s;try, and comparatively <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> as being &s;tretcht to an extravagant Extent, "beyond the Sphere of human Activity," and in|cumber'd too with Abundance of civil Avocations. Verily we look on this part of the Con&s;titution, SIMPLE <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as exceptionable almo&s;t as any Thing in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> For, as to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> i. e. &s;uch in whom tho&s;e Powers of ordain|ing Mini&s;ters, and governing the Church, are united; let us but have <HI>Plenty</HI> enough of 'em (a Bi&s;hop to every Pari&s;h, if they will) and we are content: Or if they mu&s;t be more <HI>general</HI> Officers, we cou'd yet &s;ubmit to them upon Occa&s;ion; provided their Epi&s;copacy be duly limited, &s;o as to be a mere <HI>Pre&s;idency of Order,</HI> and to leave the other Presbyters in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Powers inherent in their Pa&s;toral Office.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Prelates,</HI> our Adver&s;aries plead for, are quite of a different Ca&s;t; inviron'd with &s;uch peculiar Cir|cum&s;tances, as make them obnoxious to great Exceptions: and truly the <HI>whole Model</HI> of their beloved Hierarchy appears to me in &s;uch an unproportion'd and disjoynted Condition, as expo&s;es it to ju&s;t and in&s;uperable Objections.

<P>Again, here <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are doctrinally held to be two <HI>different</HI> Orders: and yet are practically <HI>blended</HI> toge|er in &s;everal Re&s;pects.

Yet neither of the&s;e is of the <HI>Order,</HI> to which <HI>that kind</HI> of Government (I mean the Government of the <HI>Clergy</HI>) is pretended to be appropri|ated. &mdash; I omit &s;ubordinate <HI>Officials, Commi&s;&s;aries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yea, here are Some of the very LAITY exerci&s;ing <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Powers over the inferior <HI>&s;acred Orders;</HI> and even the <HI>Rectors</HI> of Pari&s;hes, tho' claiming &s;omething of <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Authority, mu&s;t with an implicit Faith obey the &s;piritual <HI>Courts,</HI> under the Con|duct of tho&s;e irregular Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks: who were never heard of in <HI>Antiquity,</HI> about which our Adver&s;aries &s;o loudly din us in the Ear continually, but are of <HI>novel</HI> Invention.</P>

<P>In fine, the KING is according to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution the &s;ole Fountain of all Juri&s;diction Eccle&s;ia&s;tical: and <HI>Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Archdeacons, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, have</HI> NO MANNER <HI>of Juri&s;diction, but</HI> BY <HI>and under the King</HI>'s <HI>Maje&s;ty;</HI> who is &s;upreme Head of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in Contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is final Judge of Controver&s;ies <HI>in all Things and Cau&s;es &s;piritual.</HI></P>
<P>This is a &s;ummary, and I think true State of Matters of Fact in the e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>National</HI> Church.

I cou'd not help admiring at the Conduct of <HI>Philalethes,</HI> in palming them on the World, as "<HI>written by a</HI> LAYMAN": Unle&s;s by a Figure, he intended to transfer this Character to <HI>a dear Friend of his,</HI> who doubtle&s;s was mightily pleas'd with that &s;hrewd OBSERVATION in the Clo&s;e of the <HI>Dialogue</HI> (offer'd as a Con&s;equence upon <HI>Elutherius</HI>'s Argument) That the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church mu&s;t be <HI>mere human Creatures,</HI> if their <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> at be&s;t be but &s;uch. (<HI>p.</HI> 54) &mdash; I take Occa&s;ion to &s;ay here, That <HI>his Flirt</HI> at the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> (as I take it) in the following Words, <Q><HI>Since all their Power is derived from &s;uch Creatures, it mu&s;t be merely human &s;till, and not of Chri&s;t's appointing;</HI></Q> This, I &s;ay, being but ob&s;cure as to the Reference, and not expre&s;ly level'd at <HI>us,</HI> it e&s;cap'd my Notice at fir&s;t; and I now forgive it, &s;ince he makes &s;o light of a <HI>Lay</HI>-Character, and appears &s;o willing to &s;hare with us in the <HI>Odium</HI> of a Lay-Derivation.</P>
<P>I find little of &s;olid Argument, in the&s;e Letters, that's new, and not already obviated in the foregoing Papers. However, that my Rev. Brother <HI>Layman</HI> may have no Colour for Complaint of being treated as <HI>"too contemptible a Per&s;on to be our Adver|&s;ary in this Controver&s;y,"</HI> I will con&s;ider the principal Contents of his Letters; which being made publick without any particu|lar Direction, every one may claim a Right to make what Return he thinks fit unto them.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Letter, we perceive, had an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> made unto it by the Gentleman it was &s;ent to in <HI>Manu&s;cript;</HI> which, I'm humbly of Opinion, it wou'd have been but a piece of

Neverthele&s;s, we will follow him in his own Path, and e'en take Things as we find them.</P>

<P>His <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Rule, i. e. <HI>"Comparing one Pa&s;&s;age with another"</HI> &amp;c. is not only a very <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> one (as he &s;ays) but the mo&s;t effectual and &s;atisfactory. This is the Rule with all true <HI>Prote&s;tants:</HI> by this Method the Reformers confounded the Papi&s;ts, and in this Way the primitive Fathers were wont to confute Hereticks. And if in this way the Cau&s;e of the <HI>New England</HI> Churches cannot be &s;upported, we are willing to lo&s;e it.

<P>In the fir&s;t place, let it be ob&s;erv'd: If we are in <HI>doubtful</HI> Ca&s;es to form our Judgment by the Sen&s;e and Practice of the Church <HI>from the Beginning,</HI> this <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rule appears to me <HI>coincident</HI> with the fir&s;t: for <HI>the Beginning</HI> mu&s;t take in the Times of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> which the <HI>Scriptures</HI> only give us an authen|tick and &s;ufficient Account of.

<PB N="61" REF="003651_0097_10023C7FCD9CAA38">giving us the genuine Sen&s;e of Scripture. If the <HI>Beginning</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t be taken into the Account, we may well &s;top at the <HI>Scrip|tures;</HI> which deliver to us the fulle&s;t and true&s;t Reports of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at.</HI> Yet if there be any <HI>Tradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> Interpretations of Scrip|ture, let 'em be produc'd, and prov'd to be of <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> De|rivation: We are ready to receive the Sen&s;e of Scrip|ture, upon the Authority of true <HI>Original</HI> Tradition. But where is this to be found, &s;ave in the <HI>Bible</HI> it &s;elf! If then we mu&s;t recur to the <HI>Beginning</HI> (without which indeed it were ab&s;urd, to pretend to the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Sen&s;e of the Church) by Con&s;equence we mu&s;t content our &s;elves with the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> as the ONLY Rule to judge by in all Controver&s;ies of Religion, ari&s;ing among &s;uch as believe the Scriptures: <Q>and tho&s;e that cannot <HI>thus</HI> be ended (i. e. by Scripture, without the Help of Fathers and Traditions) are not nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, one way or other.</Q> So determines the learned <HI>Chillingworth.</HI> (Relig. of Prot. <HI>p.</HI> 102.) <Q>And our Rea&s;on hereof <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> is convincing; Becau&s;e nothing can challenge our Belief, but what hath de&s;cended to us from CHRIST by <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> Tradition: Now NOTHING but <HI>Scripture</HI> hath <HI>thus</HI> de&s;cended to us; Therefore nothing but Scrip|ture can challenge our Belief.</Q></P>
<P>This now de&s;troys Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s &s;pecious Pretence of <Q><HI>the primitive Church</HI>'s being <HI>a</HI> SAFE WITNESS, <HI>in what Sen&s;e the Apo&s;tles wou'd have them&s;elves to be under&s;tood.</HI></Q> For here|in He goes upon the Suppo&s;ition of two Things, neither of which are to be granted as undoubtedly true.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it &s;uppo&s;es that the <HI>primitive</HI> Church <HI>certainly know,</HI> and <HI>unanimou&s;ly agreed,</HI> in what Sen&s;e the Apo&s;tles wou'd have the ob&s;cure places in their Writings to be under&s;tood. Where|as in fact there appears no &s;uch <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Judgment among the <HI>Ancients,</HI> as to the Meaning of Scripture in doubtful places, nor <HI>Harmony</HI> of Sen&s;e and Practice in many Matters relating to the Church, it's Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Government.

<P>Thus I have exactly follow'd the Gentleman's Train of Rea&s;oning: and now, whether it be thought Logick, or So|phi&s;try, I'm &s;ure the Argument is as pertinent to my Ca&s;e, and as good in my Application of it, as in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s.

<P>After all, it may be, our <HI>Lay-Adver&s;ary</HI> will tell me, I have been arguing only in the <HI>Eva&s;ive</HI> Way, and that he expected I wou'd &s;peak more directly to the Point, in refuting his grand Charge again&s;t us, as <HI>joyning with</HI> DEISTS <HI>and</HI> INFI|DELS, <HI>de&s;troying all hi&s;torical Faith, and &s;hocking even the Scrip|tures them&s;elves,</HI> while we reject the Te&s;timony of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in favour of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> which (as he &s;ays) hath as good Evi|dence from human Te&s;timony, as the CANON OF SCRIPTURE.

<P>This is the Argument, that embolden'd the Gentleman to <HI>fall foul of</HI> his <HI>good old</HI> Friends and <HI>Fathers,</HI> as <HI>joyning with all the Dei&s;ts and Infidels in the Kingdom, to bring the Bible into Di&s;grace, by treating the primitive Fathers with &s;o much Con|tempt.</HI> But, upon the calme&s;t Con&s;ideration it appears to me

The following Re|marks may &s;uffice to guard our Cau&s;e again&s;t &s;o weak an Attack.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, The Gentleman argues upon an <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> which he knows we cannot grant him; That the primitive <HI>Fathers</HI> do, in fact, bear their <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> to <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> in his Acceptation of it. We don't deny (as we judge) the primi|tive Epi&s;copacy; but only that of the modern Stamp, which we think a Stranger to the be&s;t and pure&s;t Antiquity. Here then Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> is guilty of the Sophi&s;m, call'd <HI>Petitio Prin|tipii.</HI> He charges us as being in a Confederacy with <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> (to bring the Scriptures into Di&s;grace, which have no other ex|ternal Evidence (&s;ays he) but the Te&s;timony of the Fathers) <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> we reject the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> which the Fathers bear to <HI>Dio|ce&s;an</HI> Epi&s;copacy: Whereas it is one great Point in Conte&s;t, whether the Fathers <HI>do</HI> give their Atte&s;tation to <HI>this Species</HI> of Epi&s;copacy. We di&s;pute it: but do's our rejecting <HI>his</HI> Con|&s;truction of the Fathers, prove our <HI>treating them with Con|tempt!</HI> It's true, we cannot but have a hearty Contempt for the <HI>Pretended</HI> Te&s;timonies from the Fathers, alledg'd in the Cau&s;e of Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy, as wholly <HI>impertinent:</HI> and yet at the &s;ame time we may highly honour their <HI>Real</HI> Te&s;timo|nies to the Canon of Scripture.</P>
<P>But then, admitting the Fathers probably &s;peak of <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Acceptation of it, will he (dare he!) pretend,
<PB N="86" REF="003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00">that the Te&s;timonies in that Ca&s;e are as <HI>full</HI> and <HI>unanimous, clear</HI> and <HI>&s;trong,</HI> as for the Canon of Scripture? Is the Tradi|tion &s;ufficiently te&s;tify'd to be univer&s;al, original and un|interrupted, in one Ca&s;e, as well as the other? If not, 'tis no criminal Partiality, nor any Contempt of the Fathers, to reject a <HI>defective</HI> Te&s;timony, while we accept their fuller and clearer Suffrage in another Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But then again, &s;uppo&s;ing that the <HI>Fathers</HI> had given the <HI>fulle&s;t</HI> and <HI>plaine&s;t</HI> Te&s;timonies to Epi&s;copacy, as to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> in their Day; yet what Evidence would that afford of an un|interrupted <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Bi&s;hops to this Day? Without which, I doubt, our Author's Cau&s;e will finally mi&s;carry, and his Argument &s;ignify ju&s;t nothing. According to the common Doctrine of our Adver&s;aries, all that are not in the true <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> of Succe&s;&s;ion from the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> are but <HI>Lay-Impo&s;tors:</HI> And now will he pretend, that there is as good Evidence of an <HI>unbroken Line</HI> of Bi&s;hops, and Presbyters Epi&s;copally ordain'd, as we have of genuine and true Scriptures! How ea&s;y a mat|ter were it, for particular Churches to be impos'd upon with forged Orders, or uncanonical Con&s;ecrations; whereby the Line would certainly be violated! But how impo&s;&s;ible were it, to obtrude a fal&s;e Bible on the whole Church of God! And when &s;ome have attempted to forge Books of Scripture and father 'em on &s;ome Apo&s;tle, how ea&s;ily has the Cheat been detected! Now, that in Fact there have been repeated Brea|ches of regular Succe&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to be pa&s;t all Controver&s;y. Bi&s;hop HOADLY (<HI>Pre&s;erv.</HI> p. 78.) ob&s;erves; <Q>This <HI>regular uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Per&s;ons qualified and regularly or|dained, is a matter <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to be proved: Nay, the <HI>Con|trary</HI> is more than probable, upon all <HI>hi&s;torical Evidence.</HI></Q> But that we have the true Canon of Scripture, I hope, Mr <HI>Lay|man</HI> will allow to be capable of Demon&s;tration by the be&s;t hi&s;torical and rational Evidence A Succe&s;&s;ion of true Bibles is a thou&s;and times more evident, than a Succe&s;&s;ion of true Bi&s;hops. And to in&s;inuate, that we have no &s;urer Evidence of genuine Scriptures, than can be produced for a right Line of Epi&s;copacy, verily it is one of the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye&s;t Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is</HI> upon Chri&s;tianity, that can ea&s;ily be imagined.</P>
<P>But then further, &s;uppo&s;ing this Line of Succe&s;&s;ion demon|&s;trable, even up to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and that they are full and clear in their Te&s;timonies for Epi&s;copacy, as <HI>univer&s;al matter of Fact</HI> in their Times; yet he that argues from Fact to <HI>Right</HI> in this Ca&s;e, is a mere Sophi&s;ter: For this is to &s;uppo&s;e an Im|po&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="87" REF="003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00">of <HI>Innovations</HI> in the primitive Church, or at lea&s;t a Certainty of their Freedom from <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Corruptions,</HI> which is contrary to all Accounts of tho&s;e Times, and will appear highly improbable, if we reflect on the u&s;ual Tempers and Prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions of Mankind. But then it will be &s;aid, The Fathers te&s;tify to the <HI>Right,</HI> as well as Fact. I reply, This is as ea&s;ily deny'd, as affirm'd; and we think, no &s;ufficient Proof has yet appear'd. However, upon Suppo&s;ition of Proof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l it remains a Doubt, whether mere human Te&s;timony to the Divine Right of Epi&s;copacy is &s;ufficient to bind it on the Con&s;cience, as a matter of Nece&s;&s;ity to be believ'd &amp; practis'd. The <HI>Divine Right</HI> can be infer'd only from <HI>Scripture:</HI> if it be not <HI>evident</HI> from thence, it can never be made evident. And if the Divine In&s;titution of <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> mu&s;t be fetcht from Scripture, then it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, to prove the Apo&s;tolick Original of the <HI>Scriptures:</HI> without which it will be intirely out of our Power to prove the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy. But then, when we are &s;ati&s;fy'd of the Truth in this great Point, it follows in the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, that we mu&s;t now take the <HI>Divine Book</HI> for our <HI>only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of Faith. The univer&s;al uncontroul'd Tradition, in the Ca&s;e of the &s;acred Canon, carries a rational Probability, that may ju&s;tly beget in us an E&s;teem for the Bible, and put us upon examining its Contents: and when by viewing the inter|nal Evidences of its Divine Original, we become &s;o &s;atisfy'd of that, as to take it for the Word of God; we are now of Con&s;equence to judge and try all other <HI>Traditions,</HI> of a religi|ous Reference, <HI>by this Rule,</HI> and not the Rule <HI>by them.</HI> And we mu&s;t &s;ay, when we judge of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Tradition, by the Rule of <HI>Scripture,</HI> we can di&s;cern no evident <HI>Characters of Divinity</HI> upon it, to indicate an <HI>Apo&s;tolick Original;</HI> and there|fore cannot but vote the Pretence of Divine Right, a mere Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>In fine, allowing the Divine Right of Bi&s;hops to be held by &s;ome of the Fathers, yet (to return Mr <HI>Layman</HI> a Que&s;tion or two of his own) "<HI>Do any of them a&s;&s;ert this to be the</HI> UNIVERSAL <HI>Doctrine of the Church in tho&s;e Days?

For ought I &s;ee then we may renounce Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s ESSENTIAL Doctrine; and yet retain a &s;ufficient Re&s;pect for the primitive Church, and <HI>pay a</HI> ju&s;t <HI>Deference to the univer&s;al Suffrage of tho&s;e venerable Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors, who are Witne&s;&s;es to the Divine Original of the holy Oracles.</HI> It is therefore an intolerable In&s;ult, and abu&s;ive Sophi&s;try in this Gentleman, to repre&s;ent us (fir&s;t) as <HI>treating the primitive Fathers with Contempt,</HI> merely becau&s;e we &s;light his pretend|ed Te&s;timonies from Antiquity in relation to Dioce&s;an <HI>Epi&s;co|pacy:</HI> and (then) as <HI>joyning with</HI> DEISTS and ATHEISTS, in undermining Chri&s;tianity; becau&s;e there is <HI>no external Evi|dence of the Canon of the &s;everal Books of Scripture, that he knows of, be&s;ides the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e good Men, whom</HI> (as he will have it) <HI>we treat with &s;o much Contempt.</HI> This is the mighty Argument, he urges in Support of his Charge: but there's as little Rea&s;on in his Plea, as of Charity in his Accu&s;ation.

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> VI. I proceed now to di&s;charge my Debt with rela|tion to our <HI>Author</HI>'s POSTULATA, which I promis'd to con&s;ider.

<P>His FIRST <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> is, <Q><HI>That the &s;ame Word may be u&s;ed in different Sen&s;es, in different Ages: As for In&s;tance, the Word</HI> Imperator</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This, I declare, is an unlucky Example: the Change of the Sen&s;e of that Name, he inti|mates, came in with <HI>the Alteration of the State;</HI> and if Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will allow the like Rea&s;on or Occa&s;ion for changing the Sen&s;e of the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> viz. an <HI>Alteration</HI> of the Con|&s;titution of the <HI>Church,</HI> much good may do him with his <HI>Po&s;tula|tum!</HI> I will give him full Liberty to make the be&s;t u&s;e he can of it, to &s;erve his Cau&s;e.

<P>His SECOND <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> is, <Q><HI>That therefore the promi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous U&s;e of two Words in one Age, does not hinder, but that they may be fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the next Age, to &s;ignifie two different Things, which were really different in the former Age, tho' under other Denominations; as for In&s;tance, the words</HI> KNAVE, <HI>and</HI> SERVANT &amp;c. <HI>And &s;o it may po&s;&s;ibly have been with the words</HI> BISHOP <HI>and</HI> PRESBYTER</Q> &amp;c. I can't but ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="96" REF="003651_0116_10023CF061AF94B8">again, if the Gentleman will have the Ca&s;e he mentions, pa&s;s for a <HI>Parallel,</HI> it's certainly a very unlucky one. The word <HI>Servant,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, retains its ancient <HI>hone&s;t</HI> meaning; but <HI>Knave</HI> is become a Term of <HI>Reproach,</HI> an ignominious Cha|racter: Now I'm &s;omething at a Lo&s;s how to apply this part of the Parallel, whether to his <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> or his <HI>Presbyter;</HI> being both degenerated from their original and innocent Mean|ing: which makes me inclin'd to think his In&s;tance <HI>not</HI> a fit <HI>Parallel.</HI> And I think &s;o for another Rea&s;on; Becau&s;e the words <HI>Knave</HI> and <HI>Servant</HI> were never, that I know of, pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly as'd (as he pretends the words <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are in Scripture) in an indifferent Application to two different Sorts of Per&s;ons at the &s;ame time.&mdash; I ob&s;erve further, This his &s;econd Po&s;tularum is founded in an <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> which do's not appear evidently true, That the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> chang'd its Sen&s;e in the <HI>Next Age.</HI> However I &s;hall not &s;tand at pre&s;ent on a <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chroni&s;m</HI> here; but will for Argument's &s;ake &s;uppo&s;e it a ju&s;t &s;tate of Fact. Neverthele&s;s, the Que&s;tion ri&s;es, Whether the Fathers held their <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the <HI>new</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word, to be of <HI>Divine Right?</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> I doubt not, will be of Opinion, They did &s;o. But then unhappily for him it falls out, &s;ince Words may <HI>vary</HI> their Sen&s;e in different Ages, we are con&s;equently left at an <HI>Uncertainty</HI> what they meant by a <HI>Divine Right.</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, will under&s;tand by it a Right of <HI>Duty</HI> or Obligation, by virtue of a po&s;itive <HI>In&s;titu|tion</HI> of Chri&s;t: But the <HI>Fathers</HI> might mean by it only a Right of lawful <HI>Liberty,</HI> by virtue of the Divine <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> (they apprehending no expre&s;s Prohibition in the Ca&s;e) and by virtue of the generall Rules of pur&s;uing <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity,</HI> to which Ends they might think their invented <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> a Means adapted: and it's well known, they were wont to &s;tamp any thing with the Names of <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tolical,</HI> that they thought had a Tendency to tho&s;e excellent Ends. So that the&s;e Phra&s;es, <HI>Divine Right</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tolical Tradition,</HI> as u&s;ed by the Fathers, do manife&s;tly carry as much <HI>Ambiguity</HI> with them, as the word <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in Scripture.</P>
<P>And then another Difficulty is&punc; <HI>what</HI> was the <HI>new Sen&s;e,</HI> in which the Fathers apply'd the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> after the appro|priating of the Name to &s;ome &s;pecial Per&s;ons in the Mini&s;try; whether it denoted at fir&s;t a different <HI>Order,</HI> or only a different <HI>Degree</HI> in the &s;ame Order; whether it denoted a <HI>Superiority of Power</HI> over the Presbyters, and an Exclu&s;ion of them from the Government of the Church, or only a mere <HI>Pre&s;idency,</HI> a
<PB N="97" REF="003651_0116_10023CF061AF94B8">Priority of one for Order's &s;ake above the re&s;t, &s;till pre&s;erving an Equality of Power. I think the latter is more probably the true State of the Ca&s;e. But Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> looking thro' the fal&s;e Pro&s;pective of modern U&s;age, thinks the Name <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> meant the &s;ame Thing in the primitive Church, as now in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Ju&s;t as the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> whenever the Word <HI>Mi&s;&s;a</HI> occurs in ancient Fathers, pre&s;ently imagine it intends the &s;ame Thing, as it now thro' Cu&s;tom &s;ignifies, &s;ince it has been ap|propriated to that which they call the <HI>Sacrifice of the Altar.</HI> <Q>Whereas the Name at fir&s;t (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 238) was taken only for the publick Service of the Church, &s;o called from the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the People after it with an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, Mi&s;&s;a e&s;t:</HI> but in proce&s;s of Time the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> engro&s;s'd the Name <HI>Mi&s;&s;a</HI> to its &s;elf; and when the Sacrifice of the Altar came up among the Papi&s;ts, it was appropriated to that: For though they innovated <HI>Things</HI> never &s;o much, yet it hath been alwaies the Policy of that Church not to innovate <HI>Names,</HI> that &s;o the Incaute|lous might be better deceived with a Pretence of <HI>Antiquity;</HI> and thus under the anciently &s;imple name of <HI>Mi&s;&s;a,</HI> lies at this day couched <HI>a Ma&s;s</HI> of Errours.</Q>&mdash;And I find Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> (p. 261.) making that Ob&s;ervation; <Q>They (i. e. among Prote&s;tants) that confe&s;s &s;ome of your (the <HI>Papal</HI>) Doctrins to have been the Doctrin of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> may be mi&s;taken, being <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> by many Words and Phra&s;|es of the Fathers, which may have the <HI>Roman</HI> Sound, when they are farr from the Sen&s;e. Some of them I am &s;ure are &s;o</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash;Of the &s;ame Stamp is the Argument for modern Engli&s;h Epi&s;copacy, from the U&s;e of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign"> or Bi&s;hop in Antiquity: for tho' the Name we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay allow to bear a &s;omewhat <HI>different</HI> Sen&s;e in early <HI>Antiquity,</HI> from what it does in <HI>Scripture,</HI> yet its ancient Sen&s;e among the Fathers might differ &s;till <HI>more</HI> from the modern Acceptation of it. Tho' the Name be retain'd, yet the Nature of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Epi&s;copacy may va&s;tly differ from, if not be quite re|pugnant to, the <HI>ancient</HI> Epi&s;copacy.&mdash; I don't therefore at pre&s;ent &s;ee how my Cau&s;e will be hurt, tho' I &s;hou'd grant Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> his two fir&s;t <HI>Po&s;tulata.</HI></P>
<P>His THIRD and la&s;t <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> is, <Q><HI>That we can no more conclude, becau&s;e the &s;ame Per&s;ons in Scripture, were called</HI> Bi|&s;hops <HI>and</HI> Presbyters, <HI>that there was no &s;uch Subordination of Officers, as we contend for; Than we can conclude, becau&s;e the &s;ame Per&s;ons in Scripture were called</HI> Apo&s;tles, Presbyters, <HI>and</HI>

<P N="1">1. It &s;uppo&s;es, That there was the <HI>&s;ame Subordination</HI> of <HI>Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">byters</HI> to <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> as of <HI>Deacons</HI> to <HI>Presbyters:</HI> Whereas in the latter Ca&s;e there was manife&s;tly a Difference of <HI>Order;</HI> but whether &s;o in the former, is not clear, and out of que&s;tion.

<P N="2">2.

Whereas in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> there was a mutual Interchange: the Application of the Names was <HI>reciprocal.</HI> This makes a va&s;t Difference, and I think quite de&s;troys Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Argument</P>
<P N="3">3. It is here &s;uppo&s;ed, That tho&s;e whom after-times appro|priated the Name <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> to, were in fact and right <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> as an Order di&s;tinct from tho&s;e call'd <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in Scripture, and having a Superiority of Power and Government over them. This Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> affirms: but I deny; and mu&s;t wait for his Proofs.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg Leave in my Turn to lay down a few <HI>Po&s;tu|latums;</HI> which I de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> to grant me, or el&s;e give &s;ome Rea&s;on why they may not be admitted.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the <HI>&s;ame Name</HI> may happen to &s;ignify <HI>different Officers</HI> in &s;everal Ages As for In&s;tance, the name <HI>Governour,</HI> in the former times of <HI>New England</HI> imported an Officer, acting as <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> or Moderator, with the power only of a CASTING <HI>Vote,</HI> in the General Court: Whereas, &s;ince the Change of the Con&s;titution by a new Charter, the &s;ame Name <HI>Governour</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="003651_0117_10023CEE401001A8">denotes a Per&s;on repre&s;enting the King's Maje&s;ty, and having a NEGATIVE Voice in all Acts of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P N="2">II. That therefore the <HI>Contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce</HI> of the Application of a <HI>Name,</HI> does not hinder but that the Officer, to whom it is apply'd (tho' in appearance the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> having always been at the head of Affairs) may in Reality be <HI>very different</HI> (in regard of an Accumulation of new and e&s;&s;entially diver&s;e Powers) from what the Officer, going under that Name, was in former Ages. So it may probably have been with the Name <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> in the Chri&s;tian Church, which is chang'd from its ancient Significa|tion, and carries with it a quite different Idea now, from what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had in early Antiquity: as much, it &s;eems, as the word <HI>Mi&s;&s;a, Prie&s;t,</HI> and other Names u&s;ed by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ffer in Sen&s;e now, from their original Meaning, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t introduc'd in the primitive Church.

For when in the primitive Church, the Name of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> came to be attributed to Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters from a fair Compliance (as was thought then) of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> only to the <HI>Name</HI> u&s;ed both among <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> in proce&s;s of time, Corruptions increa&s;ing in the Church, tho&s;e <HI>Names</HI> that were u&s;ed by the Chri&s;tians by way of <HI>Analogy</HI> and Accomodation, brought in the <HI>Things</HI> them&s;elves primarily intended by tho&s;e Names: So by the metaphorical names of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Alt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs,</HI> at la&s;t came up the <HI>Sacrifice of the Ma&s;s;</HI> without which, they thought the names of <HI>Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t</HI> and <HI>Altar</HI> were in&s;ignificant. &mdash; It is ea&s;ie to ob&s;erve (&s;ays he, <HI>p</HI> 237.) that nothing hath been a more fruitful Mother of <HI>Mi&s;takes</HI> and Errours, than the looking upon the Practice of the primitive Church through the Gla&s;s of <HI>our own</HI> Cu&s;toms: E&s;pecially when under the <HI>&s;ame Name</HI> (as it is very often &s;een) &s;omething very <HI>different</HI> from what was primarily intended by the u&s;e of the Word, is &s;et forth to us.

Thus, when he &s;peaks of the <HI>Apo&s;tles appointing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> CHURCH, it's a Que&s;tion that enters into the Heart of the Controver&s;y, <HI>What</HI> CHURCH <HI>is here to be under&s;tood?</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> knows, this Word has various Significations, and is of as uncertain a Sound, as the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> I inquire then, what Notion he has of the primitive Churches, in each of which he &s;ays the Apo&s;tles ap|pointed a Pre&s;ident <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were they of the <HI>Dioce&s;an,</HI> or the <HI>Pa|rochial</HI> Form?

Now I de&s;ire the favour of Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> to &s;ay <HI>which</HI> of the&s;e different <HI>Species,</HI> he intended in the Que&s;tion before us: or if neither, then to give a <HI>Third.</HI> If he &s;peaks of the <HI>Parochial</HI> Church, we &s;hall not be fond of contending with him; provided he do's not make it <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to a Church, to have &s;ubordinate Presbyters in it. But if he &s;peaks of a <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Church, I de&s;ire to be re&s;olv'd in the&s;e Inquiries, Whether it was <HI>limited</HI> originally by the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> to a particu|lar <HI>City;</HI> or took a wider Compa&s;s, and extended to a <HI>Multi|tude</HI> of Cities and Towns, according to the Model of the&s;e Times?

<P>An other Expre&s;&s;ion I mu&s;t remark upon, is that, wherein he <HI>characterizes</HI> the <HI>Officer,</HI> in Que&s;tion: <Q><HI>Whether the Apo&s;tles did not appoint in each Church a</HI> PRESIDENT, <HI>or</HI> GOVERNOR <HI>&s;uperior to, and with</HI> JURISDICTION <HI>over the Presbyters</HI> &amp;c.</Q> The word <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> is equivocal, &s;erving for very different Notions; and tho', for any thing in the Notation of the Word, it may have the &s;ame Idea with the Term <HI>Governor,</HI> yet in modern U&s;e it &s;ignifies only a <HI>chief Manager</HI> or <HI>Director,</HI> as the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Council,</HI> who&s;e Office is to propo&s;e Bu&s;i|ne&s;s at the Council-Table, &amp; report &mdash; Now had Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> u&s;ed but this &s;ingle Term, I &s;hould have thought he meant nothing more than a <HI>Moderator</HI> in the Council of Presbyters:
<PB N="103" REF="003651_0119_10023D199EC1C398">And indeed he tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 101.) <Q><HI>That this is</HI> ALL <HI>he contends for,</HI> in behalf of Bi&s;hops, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing them fixed in that Office, and no publick Acts of Government be done by the Presbytery without them at the head of Affairs.</HI></Q> But this &s;eems to me, to appear all <HI>Je&s;t,</HI> when I con&s;ider what follows in the Que&s;tion, by way of Explanation; &mdash; "<HI>a Pre&s;ident, or</HI> GOVERNOR (&s;ays he) <HI>&s;uperiour to, and having</HI> JURISDICTION, <HI>over the Presby|ters</HI>" &amp;c.

<P>In fine, I ob&s;erve, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> in the Que&s;tion having men+tion'd the <HI>Presbyters or Bi&s;hops and Deacons,</HI> brings in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Phra&s;e, "<HI>the People</HI> UNDER <HI>them.</HI>" Now I de&s;ire to know, in what Sen&s;e and how far he will allow the <HI>People</HI> to be UNDER the <HI>Presbyters or Bi&s;hops,</HI> by Apo&s;tolical Appoint|ment.

<PB N="104" REF="003651_0120_10023D1CA4566610">in Terms: I &s;hall wi&s;h to &s;ee how the Gentleman will recon+cile the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages, in appearance &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent.

<P>But after all this, perhaps we've been talking only of a mere <HI>Phanta&s;m;</HI> a <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> that exi&s;ts but in Imagination: for we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, in <HI>England</HI> it is not one <HI>Prelate,</HI> but one <HI>Lay-man,</HI> a <HI>Chancellor</HI> that is eminently this <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> who has in his hand the Power of the Keys, and manages the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Court-trials; the <HI>Prelate</HI> &s;eldom or not at all medling with it, and the <HI>Parochial</HI> Bi&s;hops intirely excluded from it, being but as <HI>Criers</HI> to publi&s;h the Sentences of the <HI>Lay-Chancellor.</HI></P>
<P>And truly I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, the Gentleman leaves us at a lo&s;s, whether by his <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> or Governor over the Presbyters, he does not actually mean this <HI>Lay-Chancellor:</HI> for in his Definiti|on he omits telling us, whether the Officer appointed by the Apo&s;tles to exerci&s;e Juri&s;diction over the Presbyters, was one &s;o much as in <HI>&s;acred Orders.</HI> But if it &s;eem too captions, to except at his Definition on this Account, and tho' we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e he meant &s;uch a Pre&s;ident as is in Orders; yet there's another Exception, which I can't &s;ee how he will avoid the force of: and this is, That he has left us at Uncertainty whe|ther his <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> mu&s;t be of a &s;uperior <HI>Order</HI> to the Presby|ters; and may not be an Officer in the Nature of an <HI>Arch|bi&s;hop,</HI> of the &s;ame Order with the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> tho' above them in <HI>Degree:</HI> for I hope the Gentleman will allow an <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> in the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be "<HI>a Pre&s;ident or Governor &s;uperior to and with Juri&s;diction</HI> (in &s;ome Sen&s;e) <HI>over the Presbyters or Bi&s;hops,</HI>" &s;ince he has &s;o many tran&s;cendent <HI>Prerogatives,</HI> and the <HI>Prelates</HI> are oblig'd at their Con&s;ecration to take an <HI>Oath of due</HI> OBEDIENCE <HI>to him.</HI> Or perhaps Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Pre&s;ident may be the <HI>Archdeacon</HI> (an acknowledg'd mere Presbyter) or the <HI>Dean</HI> (&s;till a Presbyter;) either of which (and the latter e&s;pecially, in the <HI>Peculiars</HI>) is an Officer to whom his De&s;cription, &s;aid down in the Que&s;tion, agrees ex|actly;

<P>Thus the Gentleman has put us to &s;ome Trouble, by his floating &s;o in Ambiguities, to &s;earch out his Meaning.

The Gentleman tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 62.) <Q><HI>As to</HI> PRESBYTERS, <HI>We find, that when the</HI> Apo&s;tles <HI>had converted any con&s;iderable Number in a City, they left 'em under the Guidance of Them;</HI> Ordaining ELDERS in every City (<HI>Church,</HI> it &s;hould be) <HI>Act</HI> 14.23.</Q>&mdash;What do's the Gentleman mean by <HI>Guidance?</HI> It &s;hould &s;eem, he intends <HI>Pa&s;toral Care.</HI> Hence he has that Phra&s;e (<HI>p</HI> 63.) <HI>"They were at fir&s;t taken</HI> CARE <HI>of by Presby|ters:"</HI> and alledges in Proof <Q><HI>that Exhortation to the Elders of</HI> Ephe&s;us, Act. 20.17. <HI>Take Heed to the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you Over&s;eers, or Bi&s;hops.</HI></Q> Now, when the Churches had attain'd to this State of Things, methinks they were &s;ufficiently <HI>ripen'd,</HI> and <HI>grown into Form;</HI> a Form very happy, and which the Churches of <HI>New England</HI> by long Experience find as effectual to the good and holy Ends of Church Societies, as the <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Form ever was, in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing State.&mdash;And by the way, we have here a very notable <HI>Conce&s;&s;ion</HI> from our Lay-Adver&s;ary; That the <HI>A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tles</HI> con&s;tituted <HI>Presbyters,</HI> with an Epi&s;copal <HI>Care</HI> of the

<P>But, to go on,</P>
<P N="2">2. I ob&s;erve, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 63.) <Q><HI>It &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e every where, That the Chri&s;tians of a</HI> CITY <HI>were called a</HI> CHURCH, <HI>how many Congregations &s;oever they made</HI>:</Q> and of this he appears to be grown to an A&s;&s;urance, by that time he had got to <HI>pag.</HI> 94.&mdash;Thus, it &s;eems, we have an An&s;wer already to one of the Que&s;tions, I ju&s;t now put to him. But the other Que&s;tion waits to be re&s;olv'd: and agreable to it, I will here indulge my inqui&s;itive Humour &s;o far as to ask Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> Whether when the Chri&s;tians of a <HI>City</HI> were multiply'd &s;o as to make &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies under the Care of &s;tated <HI>Rectors,</HI> we are now to look on the Church as <HI>ripen'd</HI> and <HI>grown into Form?</HI> Cou'd it be a <HI>proper Church,</HI> while un|der the Guidance of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> without a <HI>fixed Pre&s;ident</HI> at the head of Affairs? <HI>If &s;o,</HI> I think the <HI>Presbyte|rian</HI> Cau&s;e (as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn) will receive no &s;mall Advantage from this Conce&s;&s;ion.

<P>And, by the way, if <HI>the word</HI> Church <HI>in Scripture was gene|rally u&s;ed to &s;ignify the Chri&s;tians of a</HI> CITY; <HI>if it was in Scripture-times the Ca&s;e every where</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> &s;ays) <HI>That the Chri&s;tians of a</HI> CITY <HI>were called a</HI> CHURCH; Then, I mu&s;t be&s;eech him to let me know, how he can reconcile the Form and Practice of <HI>his own</HI> Church to this Principle. It &s;eems an uncon&s;cionable Stretch of the Line, beyond all Scripture-Bounds, to draw it round a <HI>Multitude</HI> of Cities and Towns, as in <HI>England;</HI> and much more to extend it from thence to the very <HI>Ends</HI> of the Earth. In this Re&s;pect <HI>London,</HI> I think, may almo&s;t vie with <HI>Rome:</HI> and truly it &s;eems to me as con&s;i&s;tent with Scripture-In&s;titution, to unite the univer&s;al Church under one Oecumenical Patriarch as to attempt the Coalition of innume|rable Chri&s;tians in widely di&s;tant Countries under one Prelate or Primate. What Di&s;tinction is there, to make this lawful and the other not? &mdash; But I pray, <HI>when, how,</HI> and by what <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> was the ALTERATION from the approv'd Cu&s;tom in Scripture-Times bro't about? This mighty Change, from the Church and Bi&s;hop of a <HI>City,</HI> to the Church and Bi&s;hop of a <HI>Province,</HI> a <HI>County,</HI> or large Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Ground, contain|ing <HI>many</HI> Cities and Towns, and Hundreds of Congregations, mu&s;t needs (I conclude) pa&s;s with Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> if he abide by his avow'd Principles, for an <HI>Anti-Scriptural,</HI> and therefore an <HI>Anti-Chri&s;tian</HI> Innovation: And &s;urely he mu&s;t be able from Hi&s;tory to give us &s;ome Account of its Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s: for, can it be imagin'd, there &s;hou'd be no vi&s;ible Traces left of this Innovation? Could it po&s;&s;ibly be introduced (according to the Epi&s;copal way of rea&s;oning) <HI>without much Oppo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>Complaint,</HI> e&s;pecially from the <HI>degraded</HI> City-Bi&s;hops? Can this be thought, when Government is &s;o nice and tender a Point with Men? And What! did <HI>no Tongue or Pen ri&s;e up in Defence</HI> of the City-Churches? Is it to be dream'd, that this Encroach|ment upon their fundamental Rights, this Inva&s;ion of their undoubted Privileges, &s;hou'd be tamely &s;ubmitted to, without any Noi&s;e or Contradiction? And however it came on, it &s;hou'd &s;eem, it mu&s;t be a comparatively <HI>modern</HI> Innovation. For do you judge, it cou'd po&s;&s;ibly come up in the Days of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> or even <HI>Cyprian;</HI> who mu&s;t needs have had a clear Knowledge of the original Con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Churches, and cou'd not be mi&s;taken about it, &s;ince

They cou'd never have a Hand in pulling down the <HI>City-Pre&s;idents,</HI> &s;et up by the Apo&s;tles for Con&s;ervators of Peace, Unity, and Order in the City-Churches; when the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Congregations under them mu&s;t certainly be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to fall a Sacrifice to Strife, Debate, and Di&s;order, without the Pre&s;ence of their re&s;pective <HI>Governor:</HI> at the head of Affairs among them; and when indeed the&s;e <HI>Pre&s;idents</HI> them&s;elves, having once got the humour of U&s;urpation, wou'd under Colour of prudential Rea&s;ons for enlarging their Bi&s;hop|rick, be apt to indulge the Lu&s;t of Dominion, and Monopoly, which is ever in&s;atiable and knows no Bounds: And by this unhappy Means the Chri&s;tian World wou'd be fill'd with con|tinual Animo&s;ities and Emulations, the fruit which is Confu|&s;ion, mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the grand profe&s;&s;ed End of Prelacy.

<P N="3">3. Our Author (<HI>p</HI> 63.) &s;ays, <Q><HI>The Churches were at fir&s;t taken Care of by Presbyters, &s;till under the Government of the Apo&s;tles, as appears from the Epi&s;tles to the</HI> Corinthians</Q></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="003651_0123_10023D051D727F78">
Since he has mentioned the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> it leads me to make one Ob&s;ervation, which may perhaps be of &s;ome Direction to us in forming a Judgment, as to the Truth of Mr. <HI>Layman's</HI> Maxim, That in Scripture-times a Church con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>all</HI> the Chri&s;tians of a <HI>City,</HI> how many Congregations &s;oever they made. Now, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there was a Plurality of Chri&s;tian Congregations in the City of <HI>Corinth,</HI> then we may naturally be led to apply to them that Pa&s;&s;age in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.34. where the Apo&s;tle prohibits <HI>their Women's &s;peaking in the</HI> CHURCHES. It &s;eems to intimate a <HI>Number</HI> of Churches in that City, if there be any Weight in that Ob&s;ervation, <Q>That it is not to be thought, he would <HI>particularly</HI> have mention|ed <HI>their</HI> Women, <GAP DESC="foreign">, if he had not meant the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> where they were like&s;t to u&s;urp that Authority.</Q> It has been often a&s;&s;erted by our Adver&s;aries with Confidence, that it doth not once fail, That where Churches are mention'd in the <HI>Plural,</HI> they are the Churches of a <HI>Province;</HI> not of a <HI>City:</HI> But it &s;eems, here it fails for once.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e then, that there were <HI>Pari&s;h-Churches</HI> in the City of <HI>Corinth:</HI> and I have Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Authority for it, That when the Epi&s;tles to them were written, they were under <HI>the Care of Presbyters,</HI> without a fixed Pre&s;ident. But, &s;ays he, "<HI>&s;till under the Government of the</HI> APOSTLES" 'Tis granted, the Apo&s;tles might &s;uperintend the Churches every where. The Direction and Influence of in&s;pired Apo&s;tles &s;eem'd very needful in the Infant-State of the Church; and they continu|ally travel'd about, doing Good, confirming the Souls of the Di&s;ciples, planting and e&s;tabli&s;hing of Churches. But yet, were the Churches, that had only <HI>Presbyters</HI> or Bi&s;hops, without a fix'd Governor, any MORE <HI>under the Government of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> than other Churches, where the&s;e fix'd Governors are pre|tended to be in place? Were not the&s;e fix'd <HI>Pre&s;idents</HI> as much under their &s;uperintendency, as the Presbyters? Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> &s;ays (<HI>p.</HI> 65.) <Q><HI>I am &s;ure no Bi&s;hop in</HI> England <HI>pre|tends to more Authority over the Clergy and People of his Dioce&s;s, than the Epi&s;tles of St.</HI> Paul <HI>give to</HI> Timothy <HI>&amp;</HI> Titus:</Q> what Truth there may be in this, I will not &s;tay to examine; tho' I believe, the Gentleman would be hard put to it to make it out: However, I mu&s;t return him this Ob&s;ervation. That I am &s;ure many a <HI>Presbyter</HI> in <HI>England</HI> has no greater Marks upon him of Subjection to his Bi&s;hop, than do appear on <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> at lea&s;t the&s;e Prelates appear in as
<PB N="111" REF="003651_0123_10023D051D727F78">much Subordination to and Dependency upon this Apo&s;tle, as the Presbyters of <HI>Corinth;</HI> which may ea&s;ily be made evident, by comparing the &s;everal Epi&s;tles to them re&s;pectively. But whether they were <HI>equally</HI> &s;o, or not; yet if <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> notwith&s;tanding their prelatical Character, were at all <HI>"&s;till under the Government of the Apo&s;tles,"</HI> it &s;uffices to my Purpo&s;e, and proves the Vanity of this Objection in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I ob&s;erve, Mr. Layman adds a Limitation, <Q><HI>They were at fir&s;t taken Care of by Presbyters,</HI> TILL <HI>&s;uch Time as they</HI> (i. e. the Apo&s;tles) <HI>finding their Work too great, and their Charges too exten&s;ive for them&s;elves, appointed fixed Governors, or Pre&s;idents over both Clergy and People of each City, as St.</HI> Jerom <HI>&s;ays, to prevent Schi&s;ms,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Here the Gentleman &s;eems to intimate, that the Apo&s;tles kept the Government of the Churches in their own hands, and manag'd it them&s;elves, as long as they cou'd; but at la&s;t thro' the Exigence of the Ca&s;e, and as a Remedy to Schi&s;ms, not &s;o well prevented by <HI>their own</HI> Government, they at length threw it up, and out of Nece&s;&s;ity appointed <HI>fixed Governors</HI> over the Clergy &amp; People in <HI>their own Room.</HI> I wi&s;h he wou'd give as the Scripture-Account of this Fact; for I can't let it pa&s;s for <HI>a notorious, univer&s;al, glaring matter of Fact.</HI> Nor can I let <HI>Jerom</HI> &s;tand for a Witne&s;s to it; methinks he liv'd too <HI>late</HI> to be an Evidence in the Ca&s;e: neither indeed do I know, that he has pretended to be one. The Pa&s;&s;age out of this Father, alledg'd by our Author, I'm of Opinion (notwith&s;tanding what he has offer'd, <HI>p.</HI> 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 7.) had no Reference to the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Times: and I think I have very good Rea&s;on on my &s;ide, when I con&s;ider Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Arguments on this head (<HI>Irenic.</HI> p. 279, 80.) to which I refer Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> for a Solution of the main Difficul|ty he has &s;tarted.</P>
<P>And as to the Notion of the Apo&s;tles appointing <HI>fixed Pre|&s;idents</HI> over the Clergy, in their <HI>own Time,</HI> will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> plea&s;e to accept Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Judgment in the Ca&s;e, after he had <HI>ripen'd his Studies</HI> in Antiquity (<HI>Unrea&s;. of Sep.</HI> p. 269.) where he ob&s;erves; <Q>In the <HI>Preface</HI> before <HI>the Book</HI> of <HI>Ordination,</HI> it is &s;aid, That <HI>it is evident&mdash; that from the A|po&s;tles Time there have been the&s;e Orders</HI> &amp;c. What is the Rea&s;on that they expre&s;s it thus, FROM <HI>the Apo&s;tles Time,</HI> rather than IN <HI>the Apo&s;tles Time,</HI> but that they believed, while the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> LIVED, <HI>They</HI> managed the Affairs of Go|vernment <HI>them&s;elves:</HI> &mdash; While the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> lived, it is
<PB N="112" REF="003651_0124_10023D2966988228">probable there were no <HI>fixed Bi&s;hops,</HI> or but few: But as they went off, &s;o they came to be &s;etled in the &s;everal Churches.</Q>&mdash;The Dr. indeed appears for <HI>un&s;etl'd</HI> Governors be&s;ides the Apo&s;tles in their Life-time; &s;uch as <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus:</HI> But thinks there were no <HI>fixed</HI> Bi&s;hops, or but few. So then, it &s;eems, 'tis doubtful whether during the Apo&s;tolic Age the Churches had any &s;uch fixed Governors at all; but continu'd all that while under the <HI>Guidance</HI> of the <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Pari&s;h-Bi&s;hops;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s fixed <HI>Pre&s;idents</HI> came in <HI>after</HI> the Apo&s;tles time. The Pre&s;idency then in Scripture-times, for ought I can learn, was an <HI>unfixed Itinerant</HI> Thing; this is the be&s;t, that Scripture-Example can be pleaded for: and over this, it &s;hou'd &s;eem, there was the Pre&s;idency of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves. Surely, whether it was a fixed or unfixed Pre&s;i|dency, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will allow, that the Apo&s;tles re&s;erv'd to them&s;elves the &s;ame Power of Superintendency they had, while the Churches were under the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only. I ask this Gentleman to tell me plainly, whether his &s;uppos'd <HI>fixed Go|vernors</HI> were the Apo&s;tles <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors, in codem Gradu,</HI> upon an exact <HI>Par</HI> with them: or were they their <HI>Sub&s;titutes,</HI> Delegates, and Repre&s;entatives? In &s;hort, were they <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Governors, or only <HI>Sub</HI>-Governors? A direct An&s;wer to this plain &s;hort Que&s;tion will perhaps go a great way towards deciding the pre|&s;ent Controver&s;y. If he &s;ays, they were the <HI>former,</HI> I think it will be incon&s;i&s;tent with all the Accounts of Fact we have in Scripture: and if he &s;ays, they were the <HI>latter,</HI> then I doubt no Argument can be drawn to his Purpo&s;e; for the <HI>Deputies,</HI> we may rationally think&punc; cea&s;ed with their <HI>Principals,</HI> and cou'd have no <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, &s;hou'd we allow there were actually <HI>fixed</HI> Pre&s;i|dents in the Apo&s;tles times, yet it mu&s;t be remembred, They were but <HI>City</HI>-Pre&s;idents, and <HI>fixed</HI> within tho&s;e narrow Bounds; and where it happen'd there was but one Congregation in a City, there cou'd be but a <HI>Pari&s;h</HI> Pre&s;ident. And I can't de|vi&s;e at pre&s;ent, how any Argument can be drawn from either of the&s;e Pre&s;idents, in favour of modern Epi&s;copacy; which, whether it be con&s;ider'd as <HI>National, Provincial,</HI> or only <HI>Dioce&s;an,</HI> is a va&s;t Remove from the <HI>ancient</HI> Epi&s;copacy. If we &s;hou'd own Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Pre&s;idents, as appointed by the Apo&s;tles; yet a <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> over <HI>many</HI> Cities, an <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> over a whole <HI>Province,</HI> and a <HI>Primate</HI> over all <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t be ac|knowledg'd to be be&s;ide Scripture-In&s;titution &amp; Example; un|le&s;s <HI>Peter's</HI> Supremacy among the Apo&s;tles be pleaded. Here
<PB N="113" REF="003651_0124_10023D2966988228">is one U&s;urpation upon the back of another; the <HI>Dioce&s;ans</HI> u&s;urp the Rights of the <HI>City</HI>-Bi&s;hops; and the <HI>Archbi&s;hops</HI> u&s;urp again from them; and for ought I know, the fir&s;t <HI>Pri|mate</HI> u&s;urps upon the other; and in many Epi&s;copal Countries the <HI>Pope</HI> u&s;urps from <HI>Metropolitans</HI> and <HI>Patriarchs:</HI> and for ought appears, the <HI>Pope</HI> may watch over his exten&s;ive Charge, as ea&s;ily as an engli&s;h Primate or Prelate over his.

But it &s;eems to me, to lie as an in&s;uperable Prejudice again&s;t this Opinion, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> did for a great number of Years (if Antiquity gives us a true Report) make <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> the place of their u&s;ual <HI>Re&s;idence,</HI> after their Travels re&s;orting thither as their head-quarters; one or other of them gene|rally being on the Spot: So that the Apo&s;tles having that Church almo&s;t continually under their own Eye, it &s;uper&s;eded all Occa&s;ion for a fixed Pre&s;ident, and defeats all Pretences therefore of <HI>James</HI>'s being the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop there. However, I will con&s;ider what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has to &s;ay upon the head.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, to put a Colour on this Notion, he quotes &s;everal Scriptures, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.19. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.18. Yet he <Q><HI>pretends not an undoubted Conclu&s;ion from Scripture for it</HI> (as he ob|&s;erves to us, <HI>p.</HI> 98.) <HI>but only this, That &s;eeing the mo&s;t ancient Writers from the beginning have con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted him to be the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, &mdash;<HI>tho&s;e Texts &s;hould be under|&s;tood in that Sen&s;e.</HI></Q> And the Gentleman appears very angry at <HI>Elutherius</HI> for calling this a <HI>Whim&s;ical Plea,</HI> as hereby re|flecting upon "<HI>all Antiquity,</HI> which <HI>with one Voice &s;ays, that St.</HI> James <HI>was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of</HI> Jeru&s;alem". But I take leave on this Occa&s;ion to remind Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> of his own <HI>Po&s;tulate:</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="003651_0125_10023CD5A8D5FEA8">for if the <HI>&s;ame Word may be us'd in different Sen&s;es, in different Ages,</HI> he &s;hould fir&s;t have &s;hewn us, that the Word <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> was u&s;ed in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Sen&s;e by the <HI>Fathers</HI> from the Begin|ning, as it bears in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Age: But the Gentleman has with his own kind hand confounded any Pretence of this nature. For he him&s;elf has told us (<HI>p.</HI> 68.) That <Q><HI>the Word</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>was</HI> but <HI>by</HI> DEGREES <HI>appropriated to the fir&s;t Order</HI>:</Q> and he has fix'd the Date of this Fact after the Time of the fir&s;t Writer among the Chri&s;tian Fathers, if I under&s;tand him right; for having quoted <HI>Clemens,</HI> he &s;ays (<HI>p.</HI> 106.) <Q><HI>The Words,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>and</HI> Presbyter, <HI>were</HI> NOT YET <HI>fixed to &s;ignifie the different Orders.</HI></Q> I'm aware indeed, the Gen|tleman may reply, That this refers only to the Time of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ment</HI>'s writing his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians;</HI> which he has, per|haps with &s;ome artful De&s;ign, placed <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 67. But I am of Opinion, it may as well be apply'd to the Period of his Life; and that for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e if the be&s;t Accounts may be credited, that <HI>Father</HI> died within about &s;even, eight, or nine years after his writing this Epi&s;tle: For <HI>Chronolo|gi&s;ts,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e generally, place his <HI>Death</HI> about the begin|ning of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Century; &s;ome in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Year thereof; tho' others place it in the la&s;t Year of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Century: And &s;ome of the be&s;t Chronological Authors date his <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> Anno 93, which was but <HI>two</HI> years after his being cho&s;en Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI> (Compare <HI>Calvi&s;ius</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac&s;on.</HI>) We may then very rationally conclude, that the <HI>Synonimous U&s;e of the Words</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>and</HI> Presbyter continu'd at lea&s;t to the End of the fir&s;t Age.</P>
<P>And from hence I draw this Inference, in Contradiction to Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> That if <HI>James</HI> was <HI>from the Beginning</HI> call'd Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> yet here's a Cour&s;e of fifty years (the fa|mous Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in which he is repre&s;ented by our Author <HI>acting as a Governor or Superintendent,</HI> being <HI>A. D.</HI> 52&punc;) in all which Time <HI>James</HI> certainly was not called <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in the <HI>modern</HI> Sen&s;e of the Word (which Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> mu&s;t intend, when he &s;ays, St. <HI>James</HI> was call'd Bi&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> or el&s;e he's guilty of the gro&s;se&s;t Fallacy) and therefore it is an abu&s;ive Impo&s;ition (&s;ince the <HI>U&s;us loquendi</HI> is of &s;uch material Con&s;ideration, in the Con&s;truction of <HI>Words,</HI> which by Tract of Time often lo&s;e their original Sen&s;e, that an Argument can't &s;afely be built merely upon a perpetual Harmony of Lan|guage) I &s;ay, it's therefore an Impo&s;ition on the Reader, to tell him, <Q><HI>That the mo&s;t ancient Writers from the</HI> BEGINNING <HI>have</HI> CONSTANTLY <HI>a&s;&s;erted St.</HI> James <HI>to be the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="003651_0125_10023CD5A8D5FEA8">Jeru&s;alem.</Q> So that, for ought I &s;ee, if <HI>Elutherius</HI> call'd this a <HI>chimerical Notion,</HI> he did not <HI>mi&s;call</HI> it; and if he <HI>made him&s;elf merry with it,</HI> it was far from being (as Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> wou'd have it) <HI>with every little Rea&s;on.</HI> I would ask the Gen|tleman, whether this St. <HI>James</HI> was an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> or not?

And if he <HI>denies;</HI> then it will follow, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who was <HI>not</HI> an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> pre&s;ided in the grand Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem, "giving Sentence</HI> (according to Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> p. 64.) <HI>and therein acting as a Governor or Superintendent,</HI>" over an A&s;|&s;embly of <HI>Apo&s;tles:</HI> and if this be not a <HI>Chimerical Notion,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf a Stranger to common Sen&s;e, and to the meaning of common Language. &mdash; Further, I ob&s;erve, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> makes St. <HI>James</HI> a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> with a <HI>Presbytery</HI> about him. <Q><HI>The Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul (&s;ays he, <HI>ibid.</HI>) <HI>returning to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.18. <HI>is &s;aid,</HI> to go in unto <HI>James</HI> and the Elders, i. e. <HI>his Presbytery being pre&s;ent.</HI></Q> It &s;eems then, even after the Church there was <HI>grown into Form,</HI> the <HI>Presbyters</HI> were not ex|cluded from all Intere&s;t in con&s;iliary and judicial Proceedings, but were at lea&s;t what <HI>Ignatius</HI> (Ep. ad <HI>Trall.</HI>) calls <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <HI>Jerom</HI> calls <HI>Senatus Eccle&s;iae,</HI> a Bench of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and in a Sort A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with the Bi&s;hop, a&s;&s;umed <HI>in partem So|licitudinis &amp; Regiminis.</HI> It appears too, the Bi&s;hop's Dioce&s;s was not &s;o big, but that ALL <HI>the Elders,</HI> or &s;tated Presbyters (tho' there were even &s;everal Congregations) might conveni|ently meet in a Body, for Con&s;ultation, and Management of Affairs of common Concernment, together with their Pre&s;ident. Surely one might be tempted by this Reflection to think, St. <HI>James</HI> was not really (however nominally) a Bi&s;hop in the <HI>hierarchick</HI>-Sen&s;e, but rather a <HI>Congregational</HI> Bi&s;hop; or at mo&s;t but a Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Cla&s;&s;ical</HI> Stamp, the <HI>Moderator</HI> of an A&s;&s;embly of Elders: The Presbyterians will con&s;ent with one Voice, I doubt not, to an Epi&s;copacy of this kind. But &s;o much for the fir&s;t In&s;tance of Epi&s;copal Government.

<P>The next In&s;tance is CRETE. <Q><HI>The Epi&s;tle of St.</HI> Paul <HI>to</HI> Titus (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> p. 64.) <HI>&s;eems</HI> plainly <HI>to fix him there with governing Powers,</HI></Q>&mdash;over <HI>the People of that Church.</HI> So again, p. 99. <Q><HI>There are very plain Intimations in the Epi&s;tle to</HI>

<P>But further, I have a different kind of Argument to offer. Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has made a Conce&s;&s;ion (<HI>p.</HI> 63.) <Q><HI>That in the Church at</HI> Ephe&s;us <HI>there were many Elders or Bi&s;hops; and that at fir&s;t it was taken Care of by</HI> Presbyters (as the Ca&s;e &s;eems to be every where el&s;e) <HI>&s;till under the Government of the</HI> A|po&s;tles, <HI>till &s;uch Time as they</HI> &s;aw fit to <HI>appoint fixed Governors</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Now, by all that I can find in Scripture, the <HI>Ephe|&s;ian</HI> Church was never taken out of that fir&s;t State; but re|main'd thro' Scripture-times taken Care of by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> &s;till under the In&s;pection of the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> in particular. There's
<PB N="119" REF="003651_0127_100202A6D1C92960">a general Con&s;ent of Hi&s;tory, that this Apo&s;tle had his proper Home at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> &amp; that there he died ju&s;t before the Clo&s;e of the fir&s;t, or upon the Commencement of the &s;econd Century, when he was about 90 years old; tho' &s;ome &s;ay, he liv'd to 120, which mu&s;t bring him nigh 30 years into the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> Century.

Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 63.) gives this as the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the Apo&s;tles appointing fixed Governors in any place, <Q><HI>They finding their Work too great, and their Charger too exten&s;ive for them&s;elves.</HI></Q> But this is a Rea&s;on, that cou'd very little af|fect the Ca&s;e of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> cou'd ea&s;ily &s;uperintend, it being his Home. I find an Epi&s;copal Author ob&s;erving; <Q>When the APOSTLES <HI>departed</HI> from any Church, which they had planted, in that <HI>then</HI> they appointed a <HI>Bi|&s;hop.</HI> For while <HI>They</HI> remain'd <HI>in</HI> or <HI>near</HI> the Place, there was no &s;uch <HI>Need;</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> &s;upplying the Wants of tho&s;e Churches with their Pre&s;ence, Letters and Me&s;&s;engers. But when they were <HI>finally</HI> to forgo <HI>tho&s;e Parts,</HI> then they <HI>began</HI> to provide for the Nece&s;&s;ity and Security of that Church by &s;ettling <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Power.</Q> (<HI>Nicol&s;.</HI> Apol. <HI>p.</HI> 57, 8.) Indeed the <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI> makes this Remark in relation to the Ca&s;e of <HI>Timothy;</HI> who, he thinks it probable, was made Bi&s;hop, when <HI>Paul</HI> was at <HI>Miletum.</HI> Therefore it follows; <Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> at this time was to take his Leave of the Churches at <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> he &s;aith it plainly (<HI>Acts</HI> 20.25.) That <HI>they &s;hou'd &s;ee his face no more:</HI> mo&s;t probable then it is, that at this time he left <HI>Timothy</HI> to &s;upply his place a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI></Q> Nay, but verily it &s;eems much more probable, in my humble Opinion, that he did <HI>not</HI> leave <HI>Timothy</HI> to &s;upply his place; there being manife&s;tly <HI>no Occa&s;ion</HI> for it, in as much as they had the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;o much among them, and <HI>&s;aw his Face</HI> very frequently, who was certainly &s;ufficient to &s;upply the place of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> If it be Fact, that St. <HI>John</HI> had his Re&s;idence chiefly at <HI>Ephe|&s;us,</HI> then I pre&s;ume to turn that Remark of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> (for &s;o I take him to have been) I &s;ay, to turn the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s own Ob|&s;ervation again&s;t him&s;elf; <HI>For</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>while they</HI> (i. e. any of the Apo&s;tles) <HI>remain'd in or near any place, where a Church was planted, there was no &s;uch Need for appointing a Bi&s;hop; the Apo&s;tles &s;upplying the Wants of tho&s;e Churches with their Pre&s;ence</HI> &amp;c. Now according to this, how improbable is it, that <HI>Timo|thy</HI> &s;hou'd be made <HI>&s;tated Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> when there was <HI>no &s;uch Need</HI> for one there, and &s;uch abundant Occa&s;ion for
<PB N="120" REF="003651_0128_10023CDF0E2F6C88">him at the &s;ame time in other places, in or nigh which there was no <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> remaining! And if the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI>'s re&s;iding there be a Con&s;ideration that argues the Improbability of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being fixed Bi&s;hop there, during <HI>his</HI> Life; then it nece&s;&s;arily infers, that probably he <HI>never</HI> was &s;o at all, if it be true, what Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> (p. 103.) in&s;inuates, That St <HI>John</HI> outlived <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P>I will now briefly compare &s;ome of the <HI>Probabilities,</HI> on either Side of the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion. As to <HI>Timothy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lay|man</HI> ob&s;erves (p. 65.) <Q><HI>The Apo&s;tle's writing to him once and again, as concerned chiefly at</HI> Ephe&s;us, <HI>plainly intimates, that there was a fixed Relation between him and that Church.</HI></Q> This is the be&s;t he has to &s;ay, for <HI>Timothy.</HI> But there's much more of Probability in the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI>'s Ca&s;e. Chronologi&s;ts tell us, St. <HI>John</HI> wrote and publi&s;h'd his Go&s;pel at <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> &s;ome dat|ing it <HI>A. D.</HI> 69. tho' others much later. Between the years <HI>Eighty</HI> and <HI>Nin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y</HI> he was bani&s;h'd into <HI>Patmos,</HI> where (&s;ome &s;ay, <HI>Anno</HI> 95&punc;) he pen'd his <HI>Revelation,</HI> in which he writes to the Seven Churches of <HI>A&s;ia minor,</HI> among whom <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> has the Honour of the <HI>fir&s;t Place.</HI> They tell us that after his Re|turn from Exile, he dwelt at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> again, to the Day of his Death; and that this was the Place of his Sepulchre. The&s;e are much <HI>plainer Intimations</HI> of <HI>John</HI>'s u&s;ual Abode at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and &s;pecial Affection and Care for the Church there, than any appearing in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P>I'm aware, it will be objected, that St. <HI>John</HI> in&s;crib'd his Letter for the <HI>Ephe&s;ine</HI> Church, <HI>Unto the</HI> ANGEL <HI>of the Church of Ephe&s;us.</HI> But &s;urely this cou'd not intend <HI>Timothy;</HI> if Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation be ju&s;t (<HI>p.</HI> 103.) <Q><HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>&s;hou'd be living, when the Epi&s;tles of St.</HI> John <HI>were written &s;eems to be a groundle&s;s Gue&s;s.</HI></Q> Nor need this <HI>Angel</HI> intend any one of Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s fixed Pre&s;idents; as it were ea&s;y to make appear, were it worth while to enter into the Argument.&mdash;I think, the Gentleman has &s;et him&s;elf in a very odd Light, by fir&s;t intro|ducing his Plea, from the&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> of the Churches, with that Remark (<HI>p.</HI> 66.) <Q><HI>Who in the</HI> Revelations <HI>are called</HI> Angels, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccording to the</HI> PROPHETICAL <HI>Style of that</HI> MYSTERIOUS <HI>Book;</HI></Q> and then after a warm Debate upon the Subject, clo&s;ing up his Rea&s;onings with that &s;anguine Reflection <HI>(p. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.)</HI> <Q><HI>It &s;eems to me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, unaccountable, that any &s;hou'd go about to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lude &s;o</HI> PLAIN <HI>a Ca&s;e,</HI></Q> &amp;c.

<P>I'm aware of another Objection again&s;t what I have advanc|ed, relating to the <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> Church's remaining thro' Scrip|ture-times in the Care of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> under the In&s;pection of the Apo&s;tle <HI>John;</HI> It may be &s;aid, that St. <HI>John</HI> as an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> being oblig'd to be much in <HI>travelling,</HI> for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be often <HI>ab&s;ent;</HI> which made a <HI>fixed Governor</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite.

Indeed it's a common, and I think, a material Objection, brought again&s;t <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> That he was an EVANGELIST: But Mr. Layman <HI>(ubi &s;upra)</HI> an&s;wers, <HI><Q>To &s;ay this, is to &s;ay nothing to the Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e that Office might be exerci&s;ed by any Order of Officers,</Q></HI> even Deacons: "<HI>One of the 7 Deacons</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>being an Evangeli&s;t.</HI>" But to &s;ay <HI>this,</HI> I'm &s;ure, is to &s;ay nothing to the Purpo&s;e: he him|&s;elf has given us a <HI>Key</HI> to that Ca&s;e, and has taught us by a following Pa&s;&s;age (compar'd with what he has &s;aid, <HI>p.</HI> 62.) to argue upon it; <HI>What if</HI> PHILIP were a <HI>Deacon</HI> (fixed in that Relation to a particular Church) this do's <HI>not at all hinder but that, having &s;tood &s;ome time a Candidate for further Preferment in the Church, and by behaving well in inferior Affairs purcha&s;ed to him&s;elf a good Degree, he might</HI> AT LENGTH <HI>be ordered by the Apo&s;tles, to do the Work of an</HI> EVANGELIST, and become an <HI>iti|nerant Officer.</HI></P>
<P>But were <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> (as this Gentleman affirms) <HI>indeed itine|rant Officers?</HI> How then cou'd <HI>Timothy</HI> be the <HI>fixed Governor</HI> of a City-Church?

Further I ob&s;erve, the Gentleman &s;ays, They were ORDERED &amp;c. Now it's uncer|tain whether he do's not u&s;e this Word in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, as <HI>his Church</HI> do's in the Book of <HI>Ordination,</HI> where the Ordaining of Mini&s;ters is call'd the ORDERING of them. If &s;o, then I perceive, the <HI>Work of an</HI> EVANGELIST is by <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Ap|pointment a Work that <HI>Prelates</HI> are ordered or ordained to.

And therefore, though we wi&s;h heartily that all Controver&s;ies were ended, as we do that all Sin were aboli&s;ht, yet we have little Hope of the one, or the other, till the World be ended: And in the mean while, think it be&s;t to content our &s;elves with, and to per&s;uade others unto an <HI>Unity of Charity,</HI> and <HI>mutual Toleration;</HI> &s;eeing God hath au|thorized no Man to force all Men to <HI>Unity of Opinion.</HI></Q>&mdash; Words worthy to be engraven in <HI>Letters of</HI> GOLD!</P>
<P>If it be thus, why will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> talk &s;o much of the <HI>Authority</HI> of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and go about to <HI>force all Men to Unity of Opinion,</HI> by &s;etting up the <HI>unanimous Suffrage of the primitive Church,</HI> for a deci&s;ive Rule in doubtful Ca&s;es!

And what this Expre&s;&s;ion may couch in it, he has re&s;ign'd to our own Conjectures. Nay, and when Epi&s;copal Government is &s;tript of <HI>all Accidentals,</HI> the up&s;hot of Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Demon|&s;tration, is, <Q>That it is not REPUGNANT <HI>to the Government left in the Churches by the Apo&s;tles; that it is</HI> not FORBID|DEN, that it is not AGAINST <HI>the Apo&s;tles Doctrine and the Will of Chri&s;t:</HI></Q> All which are very lean and diminutive Ex|pre&s;&s;ions; and only import, that he thought <HI>&s;ome kind</HI> of Epi&s;|copacy <HI>lawful:</HI> which is little (if any thing) more than even <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have granted; &s;ome of whom have been for <HI>Bi|&s;hops,</HI> taken <HI>&s;ano Sen&s;u,</HI> as well as he. What an unaccoun|table Folly then was it, to alledge Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s <HI>Demon|&s;tration,</HI> which makes little or nothing for Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Cau&s;e!</P>
<P>It's ob&s;ervable, Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> might perhaps con&s;i&s;tently enough improve the Fathers in arguing for <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI> becau&s;e this was not a <HI>Fundamental</HI> or a matter of <HI>Faith</HI> with him, but merely a matter of <HI>Opinion,</HI> and <HI>extrin&s;ecal</HI> to the Covenant of Grace; as he &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hes. Whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> makes U&s;e of the <HI>Fathers</HI> to prove a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion; in which the <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> can be of no po&s;&s;ible Service to him.</P>
<P>And now whereas Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> boa&s;ts, <HI>It never yet was an&s;wer'd, nor never will be;</HI> I believe <HI>we</HI> cou'd crack too of Books on our &s;ide, that never were an&s;wer'd, and (to

It falls out, I have two of 'em by me; &s;ome Strictures by Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> and a more labour'd Reply by Mr. <HI>Lander,</HI> who has taken the Pains to go through the <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> Paragraph by Paragraph, remarking upon every Line and Word of it, and giving a compleat Con|futation to it.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd now to vindicate Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> and <HI>Elutheri|us,</HI> from a Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the one, and an Accu&s;ation of the other, which Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> advances in the Words following the forequoted Pa&s;&s;age (<HI>p.</HI> 86, 7.) <Q><HI>What you cite from</HI> Mr. Chil|lingworth <HI>about &s;ome Fathers and Councils contradicting others, is evidently &s;poken concerning the latter &amp; corrupt Times of Popery, and not of the fir&s;t &amp; pure&s;t Ages: and therefore is nothing to your Pur|po&s;e, but is fallaciou&s;ly introduced</HI></Q> Sure I am, our Lay-Au|thor never read Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Religion of Prote&s;tants, or el&s;e has a very bold Forhead, thus to play the old <HI>Je&s;uitical</HI> Game, by &s;hifting off his Words with a feigned <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> of Traditions.

<PB N="144" REF="003651_0140_10023D23ABCD2668">the <HI>Dr.</HI> at lea&s;t has <HI>&s;aid nothing to the Purpo&s;e</HI> effectual again&s;t us. And I cannot but look upon it, as reflecting a Lu&s;tre on the <HI>Presbyterial</HI> Cau&s;e, That &s;o great a Man, as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> fir&s;t wrote very much in <HI>favour</HI> of it, when <HI>young;</HI> and then <HI>a long time after,</HI> when he had <HI>ripen'd his Studies in Antiquity,</HI> cou'd find <HI>Nothing</HI> to write in <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to it, that a zealous and pene|trating <HI>Epi&s;copalian</HI> wou'd reckon effectual <HI>to the purpo&s;e.</HI> Be|&s;ure Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> had more Wit, than to go our <HI>Layman</HI>'s Lengths: nor indeed has he gone much (if any thing) further, in the point of Epi&s;copacy, than Mr. <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> who founds his whole Demon&s;tration on a mere Pre&s;umption, and who&s;e Epi&s;copacy &s;tript of <HI>all Accidentals</HI> wou'd be little more than <HI>Titular,</HI> or a <HI>Pre&s;idency</HI> of Order.</P>
<P>And now I ob&s;erve, That if what Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> has ad|vanced, might truly be &s;aid to be <HI>to no Purpo&s;e,</HI> then I'm &s;ure, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Quotations from Antiquity may mode&s;tly enough be call'd <HI>Impertinent:</HI> while it appears, they &s;ay nothing de|terminately of the <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Epi&s;copacy, pleaded for; nor of an <HI>original inviolable</HI> Right; much le&s;s of a <HI>fundamental Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> in order to <HI>Salvation.</HI> As for my own part, I frankly confe&s;s, it wou'd have made but very little Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, if every one of his <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> had expre&s;ly and fully vouch'd for &s;uch an <HI>Epi&s;copacy;</HI> &s;ince he has been &s;o far from proving from <HI>Scripture</HI> its <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> or even its <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> in Scrip|ture-times. The mere Sen&s;e or Practice of the primitive Church, without evident <HI>Scripture-Authority</HI> to back it, I can never per&s;uade my &s;elf, has Weight &s;ufficient to determine my Belief or Practice of any Thing, as of unalterable <HI>Divine In&s;ti|tion,</HI> much le&s;s as one of the <HI>great E&s;&s;entials of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing, Antiquity were an adequate Rule; yet nothing &s;hort of the <HI>unanimous</HI> or at lea&s;t <HI>general</HI> Suffrage of Antiquity is &s;ufficient (even according to Mr <HI>Layman</HI>) to &s;atisfy a ratio|nal Inquirer: but which Way can we come at this, with any <HI>Certainty!</HI> Can we &s;afely tru&s;t to the Opinion and Report of 4 or 5 <HI>Fathers</HI> living in &s;everal di&s;tant Ages, be they ever &s;o pious and learned, concerning <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> far remote from them, when we are left ignorant of their <HI>Veuchers,</HI> upon the Credit of which the Validity of their Te&s;timonies depends!</P>
<P>However, &s;uppo&s;ing that in this Way we cou'd have the univer&s;al Sen&s;e and Practice of the primitive Church fully a&s;cer|tained to us, &s;o as to <HI>&s;atisfy every wi&s;e and good Man;</HI> yet of what Service will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Witne&s;&s;es be to his Cau&s;e, if after all it be found, <HI>they</HI> &s;ay nothing to give Light into the

And I am free to declare, that according to my be&s;t Appre|hen&s;ion there is not a <HI>&s;ingle Hint,</HI> in all his Train of Te&s;timo|nies, clearly a&s;&s;erting <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Epi&s;copacy, as of <HI>Divine</HI> Right, an <HI>Order</HI> &s;uperior to Presbyters, of <HI>perpetual</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Obli|gation, a <HI>great E&s;&s;ential</HI> of Religion, and of <HI>fundamental</HI> Nece&s;|&s;ity; much le&s;s proving the Doctrine he advances, to be the genuine <HI>Interpretation</HI> of Scripture, in this di&s;puted Ca&s;e, by the <HI>unanimous Suffrage</HI> of the primitive Church: all which really belongs to the <HI>The&s;is,</HI> Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has attempted to defend, tho' he was pleas'd very artfully to <HI>leave out</HI> a great part of it in his &s;tating of the <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI>&mdash;I cannot but wonder how the Gen|tleman cou'd be <HI>&s;o vain as to pretend</HI> DEMONSTRATION, to boa&s;t of <HI>inconte&s;tible Evidences,</HI> and <HI>duro Ore</HI> to talk of a <HI>notorious univer&s;al and glaring matter of Fact;</HI> when his Evidences (all laid together) do not amount to &s;o much as a <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>&s;trong</HI> PROBABILITY! Upon a careful Examination of the&s;e <HI>Te&s;ti|monies</HI> from the Fathers, I find them either <HI>aliene</HI> to the Point in hand, or <HI>contrary</HI> to Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Side of the Que&s;tion, or at lea&s;t <HI>unequal</HI> to the De&s;ign he produces them upon.</P>
<P>No one of his Witne&s;&s;es &s;ingly, nor all of 'em collectively, do &s;o much as make it appear probable, That Epi&s;copacy of the modern <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Kind <HI>(de facto) univer&s;ally</HI> prevail'd in the pri|mitive Church from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> or even in <HI>their</HI> Day; much le&s;s, that <HI>(de jure)</HI> in their Opinion <HI>this</HI> Form of Government, and <HI>no other,</HI> was for ever to be us'd in the Church; and &s;till much le&s;s, that Epi&s;copacy was e&s;teem'd a <HI>Fundamental of Reli|gion</HI> by every Church and Age of tho&s;e primitive Times. I might ea&s;ily demon&s;trate this, but that it &s;eems needle&s;s; and I think, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> has handed to us his Quotations &s;o <HI>naked,</HI> with little or nothing of Comment or Improvement upon 'em, I may &s;afely venture to let 'em &s;tand ju&s;t as they are, without any Remarks of mine upon 'em Indeed I had taken the Pains to go thro' a di&s;tinct and particular Examination of them: but upon &s;econd Thoughts, for the Rea&s;on ju&s;t hinted, and becau&s;e I wou'd not unnece&s;&s;arily add to the Lenth of this Work (which has run out to an Extent already very much ex|ceeding my fir&s;t Intentions) I chu&s;e almo&s;t wholly to drop that part of my Performance, as well as the Remarks I've made on a Variety of incidental Pa&s;&s;ages in Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Letters.</P>
<P>Only I will in &s;hort ob&s;erve thus much: That whereas this Gentleman acknowledges, under his fir&s;t head of Te&s;timonies, from <HI>Glemens</HI> (p. 106.) "<HI>The words</HI> Bi&s;hop &amp; Presbyter <HI>were</HI> NOT

D. 101.</Q> Whether he means, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> were then fini&s;h'd, or that <HI>Ignatius</HI> then wrote, is uncertain. If the latter be his Meaning, it &s;erves to &s;horten the Space be|tween <HI>Clement</HI>'s writing, and <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s: or if the former, &s;till we know, that <HI>Ignatius</HI> died within a very few Years after Scrip|ture-times, and therefore the Date of his writing can't vary much, nor be very di&s;tant from that of <HI>Clement</HI>'s. We read in <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s Hi&s;tory (<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 14.) That <HI>Clemens</HI> wrote his E|pi&s;tle from <HI>Rome,</HI> of which he became Bi&s;hop in the <HI>12th</HI> Year of <HI>Domitian</HI>'s Reign: who, as &s;ome Chronologi&s;ts tell us, was created Emperor <HI>A. D.</HI> 81; tho' others &s;ay, <HI>Anno</HI> 83. So that we mu&s;t conclude, <HI>Clemens</HI> wrote his Epi&s;tle in or after the Year 93. if not after 95. at which time the words <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> it's confe&s;s'd <HI>were not yet fixed to &s;ignifie the different Or|ders.</HI> And if this Change was effected at the time of <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s writing, then it mu&s;t have been effected either in <HI>Clement</HI>'s Time, or <HI>pre&s;ently after.</HI> But now (to make u&s;e of Mr. <HI>Chil|lingworth</HI>'s way of arguing, in his <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI>) between <HI>Cle|mens</HI> and <HI>this pre&s;ently after, there was not Time enough for &s;o great an Alteration: and therefore there was no &s;uch Alteration, as is pre|tended,</HI> in <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Time. And therefore the words <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> being confe&s;&s;ed to remain &s;ynonimou&s;ly us'd &s;o long in the Church, mu&s;t be granted al&s;o <HI>not</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>different Or|ders</HI> in the Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ignatius: Quod erat demon&s;trandum</HI>&mdash; However, &s;ince this Gentleman declares his Opinion (<HI>p.</HI> 70.) <Q>That <HI>St.</HI> Ignatius <HI>is as</HI> CLEAR <HI>and</HI> FULL <HI>for the Epi&s;copal Go|vernment, as Words</HI> CAN <HI>expre&s;s,</HI></Q> then doubtle&s;s he'll ea&s;i|ly he able to prove from <HI>Ignatius,</HI> that Bi&s;hops, when ad|vanc'd above the Order of Presbyters, had a <HI>new Con&s;ecration;</HI> That they had the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Power of <HI>Ordination;</HI> and that they had <HI>&s;uch</HI> kind of <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> over Presbyters, as is attributed to our <HI>Engli&s;h Prelacy.</HI> Sure I am, It is of great Importance to his Cau&s;e, that he inform us how the <HI>"Ca&s;e &s;tood as to the&s;e matters of Fact,"</HI> in that Father's day, being <HI>"immediately after Scrip|ture-Tines:"</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="003651_0141_10023D26BB994B30">and that he give us &s;ome Evidence, that <HI>Igna|tius</HI> held this Epi&s;copacy a <HI>Fundamental</HI> of Religion. I hope therefore, and I demand of him, that in his next he will fa|vour us with &s;ome of his <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>full</HI> Proofs, under each of the&s;e heads.

<P>Truly, I believe, Mr. <HI>Lyman</HI> will find it hard to prove, that his fixed Pre&s;idents or Bi&s;hops at fir&s;t had any more Power over Presbyters, than modern <HI>Par&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> of Pari&s;hes in <HI>England</HI> have over their <HI>Curates,</HI> who yet are not of a di&s;tinct Order.

And I can't but ob&s;erve here, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> tells us (<HI>p.</HI> 112.) <HI>"Epi&s;copacy was truly appointed a Remedy again&s;t Schi&s;m":</HI> which is a Conce&s;&s;ion, that &s;eems to me to give a fatal Wound to his Cau&s;e. For if that was the Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that as the <HI>End</HI> of the Appointment certainly &s;pecifies the <HI>Na|ture</HI> of the Epi&s;copacy, by Con&s;equence this makes the ancient Bi&s;hop a mere Pre&s;ident for Order's &s;ake; not an Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal <HI>Monarch,</HI> but a <HI>Moderator,</HI> only <HI>Primus inter pares:</HI> Such as <HI>Peter</HI> is &s;uppos'd to have been among the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> And if it can be prov'd, that even <HI>Cyprian,</HI> the late&s;t of his 5 Witne&s;&s;es, meant nothing more by Epi&s;copacy, than this <HI>Primacy of Order,</HI> I tru&s;t Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will freely excu&s;e me from offering any particular Reflections on his other Te&s;timonies of a prior Date, as being indeed altogether needle&s;s.</P>

<P>The Occa&s;ion of <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s writing his Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>of the Unity of the Church,</HI> was the Schi&s;ms made by &s;etting up of <HI>Anti-Bi&s;hops,</HI> or one Bi&s;hop in Oppo&s;ition to another, which Ca&s;e happen'd both in <HI>Rome</HI> &amp; <HI>Carthage.</HI> The main Drift hereof (as an <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Author repre&s;ents it) is <Q>to &s;hew the horrid Impiety of rebelling again&s;t the duely and canonically E|lected and Ordain'd and Orthodox Bi&s;hop of any particular Church, or &s;eparating from him, or &s;etting up as an Anti|bi&s;hop in Oppo&s;ition to him: and his fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t Ar|gument is, That our Lord founded his Church on St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and thereby in&s;tituted Epi&s;copal Government.</Q>&mdash;The Truth is, <HI>Cyprian</HI> in his Writings very frequently alledges <HI>Peter</HI> as the fir&s;t and great Example of the Epi&s;copal Dignity, and founds the Subjection of the Presbytery to one Bi&s;hop chiefly, if not only, on that Scripture, <HI>Tu es</HI> Petrus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He do's &s;o par|ticularly in the Pa&s;&s;age cited by Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> from <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 33. and the Quotation I have made, &s;erves for a Commentary on that: but I'm confident, neither of'em affords any Te&s;timony to the Cau&s;e this Gentleman is defending.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, if <HI>Cyprian</HI> had believ'd Epi&s;copacy to be by Divine In&s;titution a Superior <HI>Order</HI> to Presbytery, he would never have contented him&s;elf with alledging this Scripture, <HI>Tu es Petrus;</HI> when he was &s;o warmly engag'd in Defence of the Epi&s;copal Honour, again&s;t &s;ome <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who he thought had made a bold Inva&s;ion upon it.</P>
<P>In the Pa&s;&s;age I've quoted, we have the&s;e Things ob&s;erv'd to us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cyprian</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Our Lord &s;peaks to Peter, <HI>I &s;ay unto</HI> THEE, <HI>That thou art</HI> Peter, <HI>and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.

<P>This is <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s great Argument for <HI>one Bi&s;hop</HI> to a Church.

<P>This Language of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> Epi&s;copal <HI>Honour,</HI> puts me in mind of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Hock|er</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>That the Worke of <HI>external Mini&s;terie</HI> in Bap|ti&s;m is onely a <HI>Preeminence of</HI> HONOUR; and that it is onely for ORDER's &s;ake in his Church, that God hath committed the <HI>Mini&s;terie</HI> of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI></Q> [he might by parity of Rea&s;on have added all other external Mini&s;teries] "to <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Men &amp;c. And if the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour</HI> did commence in <HI>Peter,</HI> as we know; none but <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> that allow <HI>him</HI> any thing more than a Priority of <HI>Order</HI> among the Apo&s;tles; &s;o con&s;equently it mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pi&s;copal Honour</HI> that <HI>Cyprian</HI> pleads for, can mean nothing different, nothing tran&s;cendent to that. Surely M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Layman</HI> can't with any face plead <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Authority for any other epi&s;copal Honour, than what corre&s;ponds to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Prima|cy among the Apo&s;tles. Plainly, according to this Father, the Bi&s;hop is to his Presbytery, what <HI>Peter</HI> was to the Apo&s;tles; who is by <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> called <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Prolocutor</HI> among the Apo&s;tles; and by other Fathers the Name <GAP DESC="foreign"> is frequently given him, which (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Irenic. <HI>p.</HI> 214.) imports no more than <HI>Prae&s;ultor in Chorea,</HI> he that led the Dance among the Di&s;ciples. The Bi|&s;hops then, who&s;e Honour <HI>Cyprian</HI> holds to be founded in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> were but <HI>Coryplai,</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hops, or leading Pres|byters, having a Priority or Precedency to the re&s;t. This is the utmo&s;t we can rationally &s;uppo&s;e intended by <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Epi&s;co|pal Honour. Some Re&s;emblances of it there may be in the Church of <HI>England:</HI> as in the Dignity of the <HI>Par&s;on</HI> above his Curates; in that of the <HI>Dean,</HI> who is Head of the Chapter in Cathedral Churches; in that of other <HI>Dignitaries,</HI> above the inferior Clergy; or in that of the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> who is Ordinary to all the Bi&s;hops of his Province. I doubt not, one or other of
<PB N="151" REF="003651_0143_10023D10AA43F240">the&s;e Ca&s;es reaches the whole meaning of the <HI>Cyprianic</HI> Epi&s;co|pal Honour; which mo&s;t certainly was &s;uch as that Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eld not de&s;tructive of Parity. For we mu&s;t ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. It follows in my Quotation from <HI>Cyprian;</HI> <Q>Altho' to all the Apo&s;tles Chri&s;t gave EQUAL POWER, when he &s;aid, <HI>As the Father hath &s;ent Me, &s;o &s;end I You, Receive ye the holy Gho&s;t: If ye remit to any one his Sins, they &s;hall be remitted,</HI> &amp;c. The SAME as <HI>Peter</HI> was, were even the other Apo&s;tles al&s;o, being EQUAL Partners both in <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You &s;ee, <HI>Cyprian</HI> puts all the Apo&s;tles on a Level, as of one Order and Office; and allows no one a Superiority of Power, or e&s;&s;entially diver&s;e Dignity, above the re&s;t. What &s;hall we make then of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour,</HI> he &s;uppo&s;es <HI>con&s;tituted, when Chri&s;t &s;aid,</HI> Thou art <HI>Peter; from whence by the Turns of Times and Succe&s;&s;ions the Appointment of Bi&s;hops hath run on?</HI> It's mo&s;t evident, <HI>Cyprian</HI> holds the Apo&s;tles to be all <HI>Pares Apo&s;to|latu,</HI> equal in Apo&s;tolic Honour and Power; and therefore by the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour</HI> in&s;tituted in <HI>Peter,</HI> he mu&s;t intend &s;omething con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Parity</HI> he a&s;&s;erts: and therefore he mu&s;t intend a mere Priority, Precedency, or Pre&s;idency of Order; &s;uch as is commonly practis'd in a Society of Equals, where <HI>One</HI> has &s;omething of Preeminence allow'd him, for the better Re|gulation of Proceedings, and avoiding of Confu&s;ion I know, <HI>Cyprian</HI> &s;ays, "The Bi&s;hop has the <HI>&s;ublime Top</HI> of the Prie&s;thood": But this means no more than the Fathers intended, when they call'd <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Top,</HI> the <HI>high Honour,</HI> and <HI>Head</HI> of the Apo&s;tles: &s;till a&s;&s;erting an Equality in Power, and Identity of Order; and therefore holding <HI>Peter</HI>'s Primacy to be but a Pre&s;idency, for Unity and Concord's &s;ake. Of this Nature, by Con&s;equence, very apparently and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour,</HI> which <HI>Cyprian</HI> pleads for as <HI>de&s;cending</HI> to future Times. For <HI>Pe|ter</HI> being the <HI>Example</HI> and fir&s;t In&s;tance of Epi&s;copal Honour, what Prerogative <HI>he</HI> had above the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, THIS and <HI>no more</HI> may the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> claim above the other Presbyters in his Church. Hence it appears to me demon&s;trated, beyond the power of Contradiction, That <HI>Cyprian</HI> believ'd the <HI>Parity</HI> of Bi&s;hops and Presbyters, as alike &s;ucceeding to the Apo&s;tles; Knowing nothing of a di&s;tinct Order of <HI>&s;imple</HI> Presbyters (as in the Church of <HI>England</HI>) &s;ubordinate to Bi&s;hops by Divine In|&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is the mo&s;t glaring Ab&s;urdity, to &s;uppo&s;e that our Lord tho&s;e Words, <HI>Tu es Petrus,</HI> in&s;tituted an Imparity of Order mong the Apo&s;tles; and if not among the Apo&s;tles, then a

I'm as much mi&s;taken, as po&s;&s;ible in any thing, if the very Quotation he has bro't again&s;t us from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> taken in a comparative View together with that I've produc'd, do's not give as dangerous a Blow to the <HI>Prelacy</HI> he defends, as almo&s;t any thing that can be fetcht from Antiquity, or Scripture.

<P>This Father urges it as an Argument again&s;t <HI>Anti-Bi&s;hops,</HI> That the Church was at fir&s;t built on ONE, <HI>Tu es Petrus.</HI> It's a celebrated Maxim of his in this Tract, <HI>Epi&s;copatus e&s;t unus enjus a &s;ingulis in &s;olidum pars tenetur.</HI> This one Epi&s;copate he makes to begin in <HI>Peter,</HI> and from him (it &s;eems) communicated, and branched forth. He &s;ays (<HI>Ep</HI> 43. p. 229.) <HI>Deus unus, &amp; Chri&s;tus unus, &amp; una Eccle|&s;ia, &amp; Cathedra una &s;uper</HI> Petrum <HI>Domini voce fundata.</HI> <Q>God is one, and Chri&s;t is one, and there is one Church, &amp; <HI>one Chair</HI> founded on <HI>Peter</HI> by the Voice of the Lord.</Q> From hence he collects, there ought to be but <HI>our Bi&s;bop</HI> in a Church. <HI>The Beginning ari&s;es from Unity, to declare the Church is one:</HI> And by the Tenor of his Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>De Unitate Eccle&s;iae, Cyprian</HI> thought that <HI>one Epi&s;copate</HI> was not only de&s;ign'd as an Emblem of <HI>one Church,</HI> but al&s;o as a <HI>Means</HI> to promote Unity, Order and Con|cord in the Church. His main Scope is, That for the avoid|ing of Schi&s;ms and Confu&s;ions there mu&s;t be one Bi&s;hop in a Church. With that View, as <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;et over the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, &s;o in every Church there ought to be one Bi&s;hop, ac|cording to <HI>Cyprian.</HI> But now to <HI>that End</HI> it is &s;ufficient, if the Bi&s;hop be only a <HI>Moderator,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> was: and therefore at mo&s;t <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Bi&s;hop can mean no more than a <HI>fixed</HI> Moderator; which is reconcilable with Mini&s;terial Parity, and far di&s;tant from Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Monarchy. This is clearly evident from the <HI>Analogy of Difference,</HI> between <HI>Peter</HI> and the Apo&s;tles, and the <HI>Bi&s;bop</HI> and his Presbyters.</P>
<P>I might now illu&s;trate and confirm <HI>Cyprian</HI>'s Te&s;timony, by
<PB N="153" REF="003651_0144_10023D02A2A4A318">many &s;imilar Pa&s;&s;ages in other of the Fathers.

<P>His Words are the&s;e; <HI>At dices,</HI> Super PETRUM fundatur Eccle&s;ia: <HI>Licet id ip&s;um in alio loco &s;uper</HI> OMNES <HI>Apo&s;tolos fiat, &amp; cuncti Claves Regni Coclorum accipiant, &amp; ex aquo &s;uper eos Eccle&s;ia fortitudo &s;o|lidetur: Tamen propterea inter Duodecim</HI> UNUS <HI>cligitur, ut</HI> CA|PITE <HI>con&s;tituto,</HI> SCHISMATIS <HI>tellatur Occa&s;io,</HI> &amp;c. (Hieron adv. <HI>Jovin.</HI> l. 1.) He is in that place hotly contending for the Ho|nour of the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> and commends him above the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Peter</HI> was a marry'd Man, but <HI>John</HI> a Virgin. In the Warmth of Debate, <HI>Jerom</HI> rai&s;es this Objection again&s;t him&s;elf; "But you will &s;ay, <HI>The Church is founded upon</HI> Peter": to which he replies; <Q>Albeit in another place the very <HI>&s;ame</HI> is done upon ALL the Apo&s;tles, and all receive the <HI>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and on them EQUALLY the Firmne&s;s of the Church is e&s;tabli&s;hed: Neverthele&s;s among the <HI>Twelve</HI> ONE is cho&s;en out, for this End, That a HEAD be|ing con&s;tituted, Occa&s;ion of SCHISM may be taken away. <HI>But why was not</HI> John, <HI>being a Virgin, cho&s;en?</HI> Seniority had the Preeminence given to it; becau&s;e <HI>Peter</HI> was a Man in Years: that a mere Youth, and one but a Boy almo&s;t, &s;hou'd not be preferred above Men advanc'd in Life</Q> Up|on which I remark, in the words of Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel</HI> (Reply, <HI>p.</HI> 190.) <Q>St. <HI>Hierome</HI> agreeth thorowly with St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> That <HI>for avoiding of Schi&s;ms, one high Prie&s;t, that is to &s;ay, one Bi&s;hop, was by good Policie appointed</HI> &amp;c&mdash; To the like purpo&s;e St. <HI>Hierome</HI> writeth upon the Epi&s;tle unto <HI>Titus</HI> (cap. 1.) <HI>The&s;e Things have I &s;poken, to the Intent to &s;hew, That in old time</HI> Prie&s;ts <HI>and</HI> Bi&s;hops <HI>were all one: but that in Proce&s;&s;e and by De|grees the whole Charge was brought unto one Man, that the Oc|ca&s;ions of Di&s;&s;en&s;ions might be rooted out.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus, in the Judgment of Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel,</HI> there was an Agree|ment of Thoughts, between <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Jerom,</HI> as to the Ri&s;e,
<PB N="154" REF="003651_0145_10023D2B1A271568">Nature, and End of the ancient Epi&s;copacy. They both make it <HI>de&s;ign'd</HI> as a <HI>politick</HI> means for the Prevention of <HI>Schi&s;ms</HI> and Di&s;ten&s;ions: they both make <HI>one</HI> &s;ingle Per&s;on the Subject or Recipient of it: They both make <HI>Peter</HI>'s Preeminence among the Apo&s;tles the <HI>Exemplar,</HI> which after-ages took Copy from: <HI>Cyprian</HI> makes the Bi&s;hop but <HI>&s;ummus Sacerdos,</HI> the <HI>Chief</HI> of the Order of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> or Presbyters, and <HI>Jerom</HI> a&s;&s;erts the actual <HI>E|quality</HI> of Bi&s;hops and Presbyters in <HI>old time.</HI> And therefore, it is a rational and nece&s;&s;ary Inference upon the whole, That the ancient Epi&s;copacy was at fir&s;t, both in Intention and Fact, but a <HI>Moderator&s;hip,</HI> or Pre&s;idency of Order: and tho' by <HI>Degrees</HI> almo&s;t the <HI>whole</HI> Pa&s;toral <HI>Charge</HI> might come at Length to be devolv'd on the Prie&s;t, call'd <HI>Epi&s;copus,</HI> or Bi&s;hop, by way of Eminence; Yet this was con&s;ider'd only as a lawful Expe|dient for the Good of the Church, and never pretended to be founded on a <HI>Divine Right</HI> in the <HI>Bi&s;bop,</HI> by virtue of any <HI>di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> to a Superiority of <HI>Power</HI> over the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as an <HI>inferior Order</HI> by Chri&s;t's In&s;titution: the <HI>Presbyters</HI> being only under a prudential <HI>Re&s;triction</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Powers, which <HI>Jure originali</HI> they &s;tood intitled to in common with the Bi&s;hop. Con&s;ider the Ca&s;e of <HI>Peter,</HI> as Head of the Apo&s;tles, and it gives you an exact Idea of the <HI>Cyprianic</HI> Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Now, to &s;um up my Argument: If the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour</HI> was in&s;tituted in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter;</HI> and Bi&s;hops have no Right to any more Power over Presbyters, than <HI>he</HI> had over the re&s;t of his Brethren: And if the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles were the <HI>&s;ame that</HI> Peter <HI>was, endued all with equal Fellow&s;hip, both of Honour and Power;</HI> but <HI>he</HI> cho&s;en out, as a <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> and appointed the Fir&s;t and Chief, for <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Order</HI>'s &s;ake; Then it is clearly the Judgment of <HI>Cyprian,</HI> that the Difference between Bi&s;hops and Presbyters is not <HI>&s;pecifick,</HI> but only <HI>gradual,</HI> and con&s;i&s;tent with the Samene&s;s of Order. And by Con&s;equence Mr. <HI>Lay|man</HI> is guilty of a gro&s;s Impo&s;ition upon the unlearned Reader, and an equal Abu&s;e of that good Father; when he vouches him as a <HI>Witne&s;s</HI> in the Cau&s;e of <HI>modern</HI> Prelacy, which differs from the <HI>ancient</HI> Epi&s;copacy <HI>toto Coelo,</HI> the whole Heavens over.&mdash;Will Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> pretend to know what was the primitive Epi&s;copa|cy, better than <HI>Cyprian!</HI> who (as him&s;elf ob&s;erves, <HI>p.</HI> 108.) <Q><HI>lived within</HI> 150 <HI>Years after the Apo&s;tles,</HI> A.

<PB N="155" REF="003651_0145_10023D2B1A271568">to &s;upport his Tenet with numerous Arguments from <HI>Scripture,</HI> and Citations even from <HI>Cyprian</HI> him&s;elf! when yet that learn|ed Father knew no better Scripture-Argument for Epi&s;copacy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han <HI>Tu es Petrus,</HI> and evidently makes the <HI>Epi&s;copal Honour</HI> nothing more than <HI>Peter</HI>'s Primacy, and therefore only a Pre|sidency, not &s;ubver&s;ive of Parity: in which he has the Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urrence of <HI>Jerom,</HI> and I doubt not the <HI>general Suffrage of An|tiquity.</HI> I will then pre&s;ume to retort on Mr. <HI>Layman,</HI> in his own words (<HI>p.</HI> 98, 9.) which I may repeat with as much Truth the deliver'd them, and they carry as good force of Argument in my Application of 'em, as in his: <Q><HI>All Antiquity with one Voice &s;ay, it was &s;o; You do but &s;ay, and not prove, that it was not &s;o: Their Authority is, I think, as good as yours; and in|deed at lea&s;t as much better, as they lived nearer tho&s;e Times than you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having thus di&s;armed our <HI>Lay-Adver&s;ary</HI> of all Pleas from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> the Witne&s;s he &s;o loudly boa&s;ted of, I think I have done enough to abate his Confidence in <HI>Antiquity,</HI> and to vin|dicate my Friend <HI>Elutherius</HI> from the abu&s;ive Charge of <HI>noto|rious Fal&s;hood</HI> bro't again&s;t him, in relation thereto, as hinted in the beginning of the&s;e Papers. <HI>Cyprian</HI> being remov'd out of the way, Mr. <HI>Layman</HI>'s Specimen of Collections lo&s;es its Strength and Terror: his whole <HI>Nubes Te&s;tium,</HI> exhal'd from Antiquity, di&s;&s;olves and vani&s;hes, without &s;hooting out any Lightnings or Arrows to do us Harm.</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd have proceeded now to vindicate the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Allegations from <HI>Antiquity,</HI> again&s;t the Exceptions and Cavils of Mr. <HI>Layman.</HI> (p. 109, &amp; <HI>alibi.</HI>) But after the foregoing Re|flections, I think it needle&s;s, and am willing to let them have their Fate: Becau&s;e, tho' <HI>we</HI> had not &s;o much as one con|clu&s;ive Argument from Antiquity, &s;till if <HI>be</HI> can advance none on <HI>his</HI> &s;ide better, than what he has offer'd in his <HI>&s;mall Specimen,</HI> out Cau&s;e will be in no great Hazard. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Onus prohandi</HI> lies on the affirmative Side.</P>
<P>I hope Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will no more object to us (as in <HI>p.</HI> 109.) <HI>"You produce</HI> Jerom, <HI>a comparatively modern Father";</HI> &s;ince what I have alledg'd from him, is but a parallel Pa&s;&s;age to that from <HI>Cyprian,</HI> which I tru&s;t Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will enumerate among <HI>"the Te&s;timonies of genuine Antiquity."</HI></P>
<P>I hope too, that Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> will no more object to us (as in <HI>p.</HI> 97.) That they are only <HI>"&s;ome warm unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> wherein <HI>Jerom</HI> may <HI>&s;eem to degrade Bi&s;hops into a Parity with Pres|byters";</HI> &s;ince it appears, there was &s;uch a Harmony between that
<PB N="156" REF="003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878">Father and the &s;o much magnify'd <HI>Cyprian,</HI> in their Sentiments about the ancient Epi&s;copacy. It is not <HI>Jerom</HI> alone, who tells us that Presbyters are <HI>loco Apo&s;tolorum,</HI> in the Apo&s;tles &s;tead: but as Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> ob&s;erves (<HI>Ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nic</HI> p. 308.) <Q>Even <HI>Cyprian</HI> who pleads &s;o much for Obedience to the Bi&s;hops as they were then con&s;tituted in the Church, yet &s;peaks often of his <HI>Compresbyteri</HI> (Fellow-Presbyters) and in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Florentius Pupianus</HI> who had reproached him, &s;peaking of tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, <HI>He that heareth you, heareth me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Qui dicit ad Apo&s;tolos, ac per hoe ad omnes Praepo&s;itos qui A|po&s;tolis vicaria Ordinatione &s;uccedunt</HI> (Ep. 69. <HI>Ed.</HI> Pamel. <HI>&s;.</HI> 4.) where he attributes Apo&s;tolical Succe&s;&s;ion to all that were <HI>Praepo&s;iti,</HI></Q> which Name [tho' Mr. <HI>Layman</HI> citing the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age, p. 108. appropriates it to <HI>Bi&s;bots,</HI> yet Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> ob&s;erves, it) <Q>implies not the Relation to <HI>Presbyters</HI> as over them, but to the <HI>People,</HI> and is therefore common both to <HI>Bi&s;bops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters;</HI> for &s;o afterwards he &s;peaks, <HI>Nec Fra|ternitas habuerit Epi&s;copum, nec Plebs Praepo&s;itum,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole I ob&s;erve, The Te&s;timony of one &s;ingle Bi|&s;hop again&s;t the Imparity of Order between Bi&s;hops and Pres|byters, by Divine In&s;titution, is of more Importance and Va|lidity than Ten for it; in as much as it is rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that none will object again&s;t the Authority they are in, or de|tract from it, but &s;uch as make more Con&s;cience of the Truth, than of their own Honour and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And (in Mr. <HI>Tong</HI>'s words) <Q>I wou'd lay down this, as a ju&s;t Remark upon the&s;e Proofs out of Antiquity, That <HI>one</HI> Pa&s;&s;age which expre&s;ly tell us, <HI>what kind of Superiority</HI> Bi|&s;hops had in primitive times over Presbyters, and <HI>how they came by it,</HI> is of <HI>more Value</HI> in this Controver&s;y, than a <HI>Score</HI> that barely mention that Superiority: the one &s;peaks di|rectly to the Que&s;tion, the other not. We acknowledge tho&s;e whom the Fathers call Bi&s;hops, had &s;ome kind of Su|periority, over tho&s;e called Presbyters; and it is a vain thing for Per&s;ons to &s;weat and toil, in proving that which we never deny, but will grant them at the fir&s;t Demand, but the Controver&s;y turning upon this very Hinge, whether it was a Superiority of <HI>Order</HI> by <HI>Divine</HI> In&s;titution, tho&s;e An|cients that &s;peak purpo&s;ely to this Point, are the mo&s;t proper Evidences in this Cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> XI. I &s;hall now fini&s;h with &s;ome Remarks on Mr. <HI>Lay|man</HI>'s Manner of <HI>concluding</HI> his LETTERS; that is, with an
<PB N="157" REF="003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878">Exhortation to <HI>Charity,</HI> a <HI>Vying</HI> with us on that head, and a Te&s;timony again&s;t the <HI>unrea&s;onably &s;evere and hot Expre&s;&s;ions</HI> of uncharitable Writers, on either &s;ide. (<HI>p.</HI> 76. and 114.)</P>
<P>I heartily joyn with him in the Recommendation of <HI>Charity, Meekne&s;s, and Moderation, which &s;o become Chri&s;tians.</HI> But I wi&s;h the Gentleman had been more <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with him&s;elf: for in the very &s;ame Breath, while he applauds and urges Charity and Moderation, he expo&s;es him&s;elf as mi&s;erably defective in the&s;e Chri&s;tian Virtues: and while he pretends to be <HI>"&s;orry if any of the Church &s;hou'd, at any time, treat any of us with Indecency,"</HI> he at the &s;ame time falls &s;oul of us, in a mo&s;t indecent manner, taxing our <HI>"Mini&s;try &amp; Sacraments</HI> as <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> EXTREMELY <HI>irre|gular"</HI> (p. 114.) and implicitly pronouncing us "HERETICKS and SCHISMATICKS, worthy to be <HI>ca&s;t out of the univer&s;al Church"</HI> (p. 71.) yet he has the face to boa&s;t (p. 76.) <Q><HI>We have at lea&s;t as much Charity for you, as you have for us; for you think us to be as much out of the Way, as we think you are:</HI></Q> But this the Gentleman him&s;elf confutes, by his own Plea from the <HI>&s;afer Side</HI> (p. 115.) where he ob&s;erves, <Q><HI>You allow our Orders to be good, our Bi&s;hops being at lea&s;t Presbyters; whereas we di&s;pute yours&mdash;: and if your Presbyters are not Bi&s;bops, it is certain they are but</HI> LAYMEN, <HI>and therefore cannot ordain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I leave every one to judge, who it is that errs mo&s;t on the cen&s;orious &amp; damning &s;ide. I think truly this Gentleman &s;eems to breath very much the Spirit of the old <HI>Donati&s;ts,</HI> &s;o infamous in the primitive Church for their <HI>&s;tingy narrow</HI> Principles, and the <HI>edious</HI> Practices of <HI>Re-baptizing</HI> the Pro&s;elytes to their Party, as being no Chri&s;tians before, and <HI>Re-ordaining</HI> of Mini&s;ters that came over to them, as being no Mini&s;ters before; <HI>Confining</HI> the true Church to their <HI>own Communion,</HI> and <HI>unchurching</HI> all the other Churches of the Chri&s;tian World. If St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> cou'd lift up his Voice from the Grave, how wou'd he thunder at the&s;e Epi&s;copal <HI>Donati&s;ts!</HI> Yet it may be <HI>they wou'd not be per|&s;uaded, tho' one &s;hou'd</HI> even <HI>ri&s;e from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with tho&s;e excellent Remarks of the catholick and charitable Mr. <HI>Chilling worth.</HI> <Q>The <HI>over-valuing</HI> of the Dif|ferences among Chri&s;tians (&s;ays he, <HI>Relig. Prot.</HI> p. 175.) is one of the greate&s;t Maintainers of the SCHISMS of Chri&s;ten|dom.</Q> Again (<HI>p.</HI> 177.) <Q>Certainly, if <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> be faul|ty in this matter (i. e. <HI>playing the</HI> POPE) it's for doing it <HI>too much,</HI> and not too little. This pre&s;umptuous <HI>Impo&s;ing</HI> of the Sen&s;es of <HI>Men</HI> upon the Words of <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Sen&s;es of Men upon the <HI>general</HI> Words of <HI>God,</HI> and laying them up|on
