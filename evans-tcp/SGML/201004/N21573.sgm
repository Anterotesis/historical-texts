<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and ha&s;ty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally u&s;ed, has been the means of not only introducing, without de&s;ign, into the Hebrew Bible, an in&s;ertion of &s;ome new words, but likewi&s;e an expul&s;ion of &s;ome of the old, which produces a di&s;agreement in &s;ome few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian cap|tivity: &s;ome parts of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation are con&s;equently erroneous; but they are &s;o immate|rial as not to affect, in the lea&s;t, the truth of its &s;acred <HI>Records,</HI> or the tendency of its divine in|&s;truction. The few parts of the Engli&s;h tran&s;la|tion, which I am in&s;tructed to alter in my wri|tings, the propriety will be allowed by every per&s;on that has di&s;cernment to perceive, or con|viction to believe:&mdash;beyond the limits of my au|thority, for it is pre&s;cribed, I am not &s;uffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</P>
<P>The following are the words which the Lord God &s;poke to me in a vi&s;ion, &s;oon after I was
<PB N="4" REF="028359_0003_0FD8C521CCECCAC8">
commanded to write and make known his judg|ments, for the good of London and general bene|fit of all nations:&mdash;There is no other man under the whole heaven that I di&s;cover the errors of the Bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, &s;o that they may be re&s;tored as they were in the beginning, but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it nece&s;&s;ary to adopt the &s;ame language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words&mdash;ye, thee, and thou; but God &s;poke to me in a vi&s;ion of the night, and &s;aid&mdash;Write in the &s;ame manner as I always &s;peak to you; write as other men do; write according to the cu&s;tom of the country you live in; you will then be bet|ter attended to, and what you write will be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood.</P>
<P>A man that has been an officer in the navy, who&s;e immediate ance&s;tors have been &s;eparated from the Jews &s;uch a con&s;iderable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name, &s;uch a man declaring him&s;elf openly to the world a Prophet of God, the revealed Prince allotted to order the &s;udden return of the He|brews from all nations, and govern them in the land of I&s;rael, will, with &s;ome rea&s;on, I allow, excite both a&s;toni&s;hment and doubt; but from the multiplied recorded te&s;tiomonies I produce, which no other on earth can, it ought not to prevail with any per&s;on as a ju&s;t objection again&s;t believing what I write.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028359_0004_0FD8C56814674828">For ob&s;erve, &s;ome ho&s;tile profe&s;&s;ion was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the re|corded judgment on the family I am de&s;igned to repre&s;ent in the &s;eat of government; therefore, with all the certain proofs I have and will con|&s;tantly bring forward, with all the ju&s;t rea&s;ons I advance, the &s;urpri&s;e and doubt, entertained at the beginning, ought to vani&s;h in as little time as would be requi&s;ite to read again the book which contains the account.</P>
<P>But remember likewi&s;e, from the records of Scripture, that Mo&s;es was taken away in his in|fancy, and remained &s;eparated from his brethren for eighty years: the fir&s;t forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and cu&s;toms of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the I&s;raelites as the prophet of God, to order their ha&s;ty departure from Pha|raoh's bondage, and afterwards to conduct them to the promi&s;ed land.</P>
<P>Saul, the &s;on of Ki&s;h, after being anointed king, prophe&s;ied in company with other men, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of all that &s;aw him.</P>
<P>David, king of I&s;rael, the greate&s;t favourite that ever God had on earth, who&s;e wars, though many, originated at that time from nece&s;&s;ity and ju&s;tice, never undertook, but to prevent the in|troduction of idolatry, and pre&s;erve in the land of I&s;rael a true uninterrupted wor&s;hip of God,

was a prophet; and for who&s;e &s;ake, in remem|brance of his name, be&s;ieging armies were de|&s;troyed, and Jeru&s;alem &s;afely delivered. Yet this great monarch, this unequalled favourite, this pattern of mercy to all kings, and who alone, of all men under heaven, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed promi&s;e of everla&s;ting national government, could not, (but the objection did not proceed from any charge of inju&s;tice or &s;in,) for, being a man of war, and having &s;hed much blood on the earth, although done by the expre&s;s concurrence of the Mo&s;t High, be permitted to build at Jeru|&s;alem a temple of wor&s;hip for him: The great honour was given to Solomon, a king of peace, his &s;on and immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or; &s;o aver&s;e, though nece&s;&s;itated to order it, was the Creator of the world to the effu&s;ion of blood and the de&s;tructi|on of man.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="quotation">
<HEAD><HI>The Prophet Daniel,</HI> Chap. vii.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t year of Bel&s;hazzar, king of Baby|lon, Daniel had a dream, and vi&s;ions in the night on his bed; then he wrote the vi&s;ions, to &s;hew the &s;ub&s;tance of what they contained.</P>
<P N="2">2. Daniel &s;pake and &s;aid; I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion by night, and behold the four winds of the hea|ven &s;trove on the great &s;ea.</P>
<P N="3">3. And <HI>four great bea&s;ts</HI> came from the &s;ea, different one from another.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="10" REF="028359_0009_0FD8C5278154D9D0">4. The fir&s;t was like a lion, and it had ea|gle's wings: I beheld until the wings were pluck|ed, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made &s;tand on the feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</P>
<P>The lion means George the Third, the pre|&s;ent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king; made &s;tand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the condition of other men, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;imilar thoughts.</P>
<P>It is more than twenty months &s;ince I fir&s;t wrote to the king, queen, and mini&s;ter of &s;tate, to inform them of many things that would come to pa&s;s; that the time was nearly accompli&s;hed for &s;ome of the judgments of God to be made manife&s;t, and al&s;o that this prophecy was fulfil|ling: I be&s;eeched them in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and re&s;pectful language, not to join in the war on any account whatever, or even encourage it; for the death of Louis the &s;ixteenth would be im|po&s;&s;ible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its con&s;equences, proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and pre&s;erve the monarchy by force, was oppo|&s;ing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth &s;hould mo&s;t certainly take place.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the war was delu&s;ive, the en|couragements of &s;ucce&s;s that it held out to prin|ces
<PB N="11" REF="028359_0010_0FD8C56F645715D8">
were deceitful; but tho&s;e encouragements of delu&s;ion were permitted, to bring many nations under the judgment of God, and puni&s;h them for the heavy guilt of oppo&s;ing his decrees.</P>
<P>If many had no more to &s;ight again&s;t than a few men alone, or nations but one divided nation to &s;ubdue, then it might with rea&s;on be expected that the greate&s;t number would &s;oon overcome the lea&s;t, and that many &s;trong nations would &s;oon conquer a weak one: but it is many men fight|ing again&s;t the Spirit of God, and &s;trong nations labouring in vain with their blood and trea&s;ure to overthrow his judgment.</P>
<P>The Lord God permits this oppo&s;ition for three years and a half, to fulfil the determined part of this prophecy on all that oppo&s;e it; that done, his judgments will take place, to puni&s;h man and lay wa&s;te kingdoms.</P>
<P>St. John the Apo&s;tle, in the nineteenth chap|ter of the Revelation, alludes to the pre&s;ent time of the world, and means the &s;ame things, though differently de&s;cribed, as the Prophet Daniel does in the &s;eventh chapter; for which I am com|manded to in&s;ert a part, that all princes and governments may be publicly warned, that they may know the con&s;equences of this war, from the judgment of God, will be&mdash;death to millions, and everla&s;ting di&s;tre&s;s to all nations.</P>
<P N="10">10. And I fell at his feet to wor&s;hip him, and he &s;aid to me, &s;ee thou do it not; I am thy fellow
<PB N="12" REF="028359_0011_0FD8C52BC68E6010">
&s;ervant, and of thy brethren that have the te&s;ti|mony of Je&s;us; wor&s;hip God: for the te&s;timony of Je&s;us is the &s;pirit of prophecy.</P>
<P N="11">11. And I &s;aw heaven opened; and behold a white hor&s;e; and he that &s;at on him was called Faithful and True: and in righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth judge and make war.</P>
<P N="12">12. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="13">13. And he was cloathed with a ve&s;ture dip|ped in blood: and his name is called, The word of God.</P>
<P N="14">14. And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white hor&s;es, cloathed in fine linen, white and clean.</P>
<P>The armies are an allu&s;ion to the powerful judg|ments of God, under what&mdash;or how many differ|ent forms their vi&s;itation of death is made on the world.</P>
<P N="15">15. And out of his mouth goes a &s;harp &s;word, that with it he &s;hould &s;mite the nations: and he will rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine pre&s;s of the fiercene&s;s and wrath of Al|mighty God.</P>
<P N="16">16 And he has on his ve&s;ture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</P>
<P N="17">17. And I &s;aw an angel &s;tanding in the &s;un; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ried with a loud voice, (meaning thunder, which is explained in the fir&s;t book of Revealed
<PB N="13" REF="028359_0012_0FD8C570E6DB24C0">
Knowledge) &s;aying to all the fowls that fly in the mid&s;t of heaven, come and gather your&s;elves toge|ther to the &s;upper of the Great God.</P>
<P N="18">18. That ye may eat the fle&s;h of kings, and the fle&s;h of captains, and the fle&s;h of mighty men, and the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, and of them that &s;it on them; and the fle&s;h of all men, both free and bond, both &s;mall and great.</P>
<P N="19">19. And I &s;aw the bea&s;t, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war again&s;t him that &s;at on the hor&s;e, and again&s;t his army.</P>
<P N="20">20. And the bea&s;t was taken, and with him the fal&s;e prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had receiv|ed the mark of the bea&s;t, and them that wor|&s;hipped his image. The&s;e both were ca&s;t alive into a lake of fire burning with brim&s;tone.</P>
<P N="21">21. And the remnant were &s;lain with the &s;word of him that &s;at on the hor&s;e, which &s;word pro|ceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> vii. <HI>continued.</HI> 5. And behold, another bea&s;t; a &s;econd, like a bear: and it rai&s;ed it&s;elf up on one &s;ide, with three ribs in its mouth be|tween its teeth; and they &s;aid thus to it, Ari&s;e, devour much fle&s;h.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e means the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia: She is according to the judgment of God in this prophecy, decreed to &s;uffer death: and by
<PB N="14" REF="028359_0013_0FD8C52D07DD61C8">
revelation I am informed it will be done by the hands of man.</P>
<P N="6">6. After this, I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard: which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the bea&s;t had al&s;o four heads, and dominion was given to it.</P>
<P>The leopard, means Louis the &s;ixteenth king of France: the wings of a fowl on its back, is, like the eagle's on the lion, an allu&s;ion to the king's great moveable power.</P>
<P>The fall of this monarch from a throne, and afterwards &s;uffering death, to fulfil the judgment of God by his prophet Daniel, was impo&s;&s;ible for all the armies of Europe to prevent; equally &s;o as the decreed death of Charles the fir&s;t, king of England, which is mentioned by St. John in the thirteenth chapter and third ver&s;e of the Revela|tion: <HI>the deadly wound being healed,</HI> in the &s;ame ver&s;e; means the <HI>recovery</HI> of monarchy <HI>by the re|&s;toration</HI> of Charles the &s;econd.</P>
<P N="7">7. After this I &s;aw in the night vi&s;ions a fourth bea&s;t; and behold, it was dreadful, and terrible, and &s;trong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured, broke in pieces, and &s;tamped on the re&s;idue (meaning the electors) with its feet; it was different from all the bea&s;ts that were &s;een before, and it had ten horns.</P>
<P>This great bea&s;t, &s;o different from the others, means the pre&s;ent Emperor of Germany; the ten horns, mean the electors, or princes of the em|pire.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028359_0014_0FD8C57694C86B58">In one part of this chapter the horns are deno|minated kings; the rea&s;on is, they rai&s;e armies, go to war, and govern with ab&s;olute power, like them; but notwith&s;tanding, they all acknowledge the Emperor as their chief, and under that ac|knowledgment of &s;ubjection are &s;olemnly en|gaged to defend his empire when called on. For which, to conceal the meaning of the prophe|&s;y, until the fulne&s;s of time comes and the appoint|ed per&s;on for it to be revealed to, the vi&s;ion repre|&s;ents the German princes as horns of defence be|longing to the Emperor's head.</P>
<P>It devoured, broke in pieces, and &s;tamped on the re&s;idue with its feet&mdash;means the entire de|&s;truction of the German electors; and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their territories by the Emperor: he will de&s;troy them, and al&s;o &s;pread his dominion over Italy; threatening at the &s;ame time all Europe, and de&s;pi&s;ing its kings with their feeble efforts to oppo&s;e him. Rome will fall under his power, and &s;o will Venice likewi&s;e; the former will be retaken by the French republic, but the latter will be plundered and almo&s;t de&s;troyed. After this, to fulfil the prophecy and the judgment of God, he will &s;uffer death from the hands of man.</P>
<P>The orders of the Emperor, in the Netherlands are, that if the Au&s;trian army &s;hould be defeated, <HI>and it mo&s;t &s;urely will,</HI> for I am commanded to re|peat, as an example and warning, what the pro|phet
<PB N="16" REF="028359_0015_0FD8C531BA800748">
Jeremiah was commanded to &s;ay to the me&s;&s;engers of Zedekiah, king of Judah.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xxxvii. 9. Thus &s;ays the Lord; Deceive not your&s;elves, &s;aying, the Chaldeans will &s;urely depart from us: for they &s;hall not depart.</P>
<P N="10">10. For though he had &s;mitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight again&s;t you, and there remained but wounded men, yet they &s;hould ri&s;e up, every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame example, if the French army was to be defeated, even again, and again it &s;hould re|cover and conquer likewi&s;e; (that all the judg|ments of God, in the &s;eventh chapter of the pro|phecy of Daniel, may take their cour&s;e, and be ful|filled,) to acknowledge the French republic, and make an immediate peace on the be&s;t terms that can be obtained, the intere&s;ts of other nations will not be much con&s;ulted: time, the threats of a victorious enemy, and the perilous condition of the German army, will not admit the lea&s;t delay.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h will &s;harply remon&s;trate again&s;t this conduct; for which their army, however in|credible it may appear to the Government now, will be &s;urrounded, di&s;armed, and commanded to depart: but their General will be detained by the Au&s;trian; and by revelation from the Lord God to me, he falls to the ground.</P>
<P>The Emperor being exhau&s;ted of money by the war, but having a large army at his command,
<PB N="17" REF="028359_0016_0FD8C577A3F48378">
determines, now he has made peace with the French, and quarrelled with the Engli&s;h, to ex|ecute the plan he has for &s;ome time conceived the hopes of being one day able to accompli&s;h&mdash; his father and uncle, &s;trange as it may appear, yet it is mo&s;t certainly true, for I am informed, by re|velation, conceived the &s;ame de&s;ign, and believed the attempt ea&s;ily practicable when the opportuni|ty offered, which is&mdash;<HI>the reduction of all Germany, under the &s;ole government of him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>He begins with &s;eizing on the electorate of Hanover, and plundering it quite bare: after this &s;ucce&s;s, his ambition for more exten&s;ive dominion will ri&s;e; it will now lead him boldly forward to &s;ubject and devour them all. For God, to ful|fil his judgments, and this prophecy of Daniel, in chapter vii. will deliver him over, to be go|verned by the &s;ecret, but powerful workings of an evil &s;pirit; becau&s;e his inclinations are bad: according to all that I informed the King and Queen of in May and June 1792; as he did Ahab, king of I&s;rael, to accompli&s;h his fall, and the en|tire de&s;truction of his family.</P>

<P N="8">8. And the king of I&s;rael &s;aid to Jeho&s;haphat, There is one man yet, Micaiah, the &s;on of Im|lah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him, for he does not prophecy good of me, but evil. And Jeho&s;haphat &s;aid, Let not the king &s;ay &s;o.</P>

good to the king: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and &s;peak that which is good al&s;o.</P>

<P N="18">18. And the king of I&s;rael &s;aid to Jeho&s;ha|phat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecy no good for me, but evil?</P>

<P>The Emperor's council will be filled with the &s;ame delu&s;ive evil &s;pirit, that they may concur with him, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame violent inclinati|on for war and human de&s;truction as him&s;elf. At this time a fre&s;h decree will be i&s;&s;ued from Vienna, commanding all Germany, and all the people under his government, as he conquers them by fire and &s;word, to offer &s;olemn prayers up to the Lord God, for the further &s;ucce&s;s of his imperial maje&s;ty's arms, the entire de&s;tructi|on of his enemies, and the pre&s;ervation of him|&s;elf; &s;tyling him, <HI>in bla&s;phemy again&s;t God,</HI> then mo&s;t gracious, ju&s;t, and merciful &s;overeign Lord.</P>
<P>The other nations of Europe, afraid and trem|bling, will as &s;olemnly implore the &s;ame Lord God for peace and &s;afety, again&s;t &s;uch a cruel ene|my, forgetting, that it was but a little time before, they were praying in the &s;ame &s;train of bla&s;phe|my as him&s;elf&mdash;<HI>to de&s;troy their enemies, and give &s;ucce&s;s to their arms;</HI> to that very gracious a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> compa&s;&s;ionate God, who &s;ealed the redemption of man with his own blood, and &s;trictly com|manded all nations, as his children and people, to live in peace and brotherly love.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition is in vain; he goes through the principalities like a flood, and collects in his pro|gre&s;s a mighty army. The cour&s;e of the pro|phecy
<PB N="21" REF="028359_0020_0FD8C57DED7659F8">
is, That he &s;hall conquer and de&s;troy all before him: therefore he certainly will; and take away the trea&s;ure of many wealthy cities like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>After this, to fini&s;h oppre&s;&s;ion, and fulfil the decreed judgment of God, the French republic will be rai&s;ed again&s;t him; his army will be en|tirely overthrown in Italy, and him&s;elf will be com|pelled to &s;eek &s;helter among the very people who&s;e relations he de&s;troyed, who&s;e towns he plun|dered and burnt but a little time before. This is Francis, the pre&s;ent reigning Emperor of Ger|many, who is de&s;cribed, in chap. vii. ver. 7. of the prophecy of Daniel, as great, &s;trong, and ter|rible; &s;tamping under his feet with contempt, and de&s;troying all the princes round him. His ambition will encrea&s;e with his dominion, and his conque&s;ts will be &s;o wonderful, for a &s;hort time, as to make all Europe tremble; his end is mi&s;erable; and as he treated others without mer|cy, no mercy will be &s;hewn to him. His death, by the hands of man is certain, becau&s;e decreed; and his puni&s;hment everla&s;ting, becau&s;e recorded. To be related to him now, will be con&s;idered hereafter as a capital crime.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> vii. <HI>continued.</HI> 8. I con&s;idered the horns, and behold there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the fir&s;t horns plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth &s;peaking great things.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028359_0021_0FD8C53ABA3B3DE8">This little horn, that grows great, and becomes &s;o ambitious as to pluck up three of the other horns, to extend his own dominion, is the pre|&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia. He is one of the imperial electors, and to fulfil exactly what the vi&s;ions of God de&s;cribe him to be, he confidently calls him|&s;elf, in great words,&mdash;The preponderating mem|ber of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia will acknowledge the French republic, and al&s;o make peace with it: he will oppo&s;e the Emperor, and likewi&s;e follow his ex|ample; by which his dominions, to fulfil the pro|phecy, will be enlarged (comparatively for a mo|ment only) by the addition of three electorates, when the Bear, (meaning Ru&s;&s;ia,) watching for the opportunity, <HI>will ri&s;e</HI> and devour Pru&s;&s;ia at one &s;ide, while the Emperor de&s;troys him at the other. His armies will be defeated, and his ca|pitol &s;et on fire by the Bear: his life will be taken away from the earth, and his monarchy, to fulfil the everla&s;ting decrees of the Lord God, in the prophecy of Daniel, will be de&s;troyed; never, never, to be re&s;tored any more.</P>
<P>Ru&s;&s;ia will a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor in the beginning to promote her favourite de&s;ign of de&s;troying the Turki&s;h empire; &s;he will al&s;o quarrel with the Poles, and devour great numbers of them; War|&s;aw will be &s;et on fire, and the government en|tirely changed. At this time the Ru&s;&s;ian army, (or Bear,) as if impatient for its food, <HI>to ri&s;e and
<PB N="23" REF="028359_0022_0FD8C57F24DFF4E8">
devour much fle&s;h,</HI> will enter Turkey, and compara|tively run over the land; treading down, and de|vouring with great fury, all oppo&s;ition in its way. At the capitol it &s;tops; here are its decreed bounds; no farther it mu&s;t go. Here the Ru&s;&s;ian general divides the &s;poils of many cities with his army, and the rich provinces of Turkey between his offi|cers. Here he de&s;pi&s;es the oath of fidelity, and throws away the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject&mdash;pro|claiming him&s;elf Emperor of Greece.</P>
<P>After this the Swedes will enter Ru&s;&s;ia, and de|&s;troy with great fury; even the &s;hips of war and capitol will not e&s;cape. The Ru&s;&s;ian empire will be convul&s;ed in many parts by its general and go|vernors, each ri&s;ing up in his place, and claiming an authority to command the other: they will fight until great multitudes are de&s;troyed, and the country made de&s;olate. The imperial family will all be cut off, and no &s;ucce&s;&s;or will for ever after ari&s;e; the government, at the &s;ame time, will be broke to pieces, and utterly di&s;&s;olved; never, ne|ver, to be re&s;tored any more.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Monarchy will cea&s;e by this war, and the Stadholder&s;hip of Holland will be cut off clo&s;e to the ground; according to the vi&s;ions of God to me, in 1792, and which I communicated at that time by his &s;acred command to the king and queen of England.</P>
<P>The king of Sardinia will be dethroned, and the Popedom de&s;troyed for ever! according to
<PB N="24" REF="028359_0023_0FD8C53E4587B5E0">
the revelation of God to me, and which I com|municated to the Engli&s;h prime mini&s;ter before the war with France was entered into; concluding what I wrote to him with the&s;e words&mdash;It is not all the navy of England, nor the armies of Europe united, can prevent the king of Sardinia from be|ing dethroned.</P>
<P>The <HI>death of the French king,</HI> as one of the particular number mentioned in the &s;eventh chap|ter of Daniel, decreed to die, took place, to ful|fil the pre-determined judgment of God by this prophet; the monarchy of France is likewi&s;e by the &s;ame judgment, aboli&s;hed for ever, and the pre&s;ent form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed. There|fore marvel no more that it cannot be conquered by all the armies without, nor de&s;troyed by all the commotions within; if it could, by human power, the <HI>Horn</HI> (meaning the king of Pru&s;&s;ia) would be the alloted man to accompli&s;h it: for the meaning of the prophecy is, that he &s;hall pre|vail again&s;t France for three years and a half, but not to conquer the whole: he would have faith|fully kept with his army in France the promi&s;es he made with his mouth on entering it; which were, to deliver over the towns for plunder, and the people for death, if he was oppo&s;ed. It is for this that he is de&s;cribed by Daniel, to have a <HI>mouth &s;peaking great things and bla&s;phemies.</HI> All this would have been permitted, becau&s;e record|ed, to fulfil the prophecy; to ha&s;ten his own de|&s;truction,
<PB N="25" REF="028359_0024_0FD8C585EAC24618">
and the general fall of <HI>European mo|narchy.</HI></P>

both you and him in certain death? What I ac|quainted you with in 1792, and often &s;ince, was made known to me by <HI>vi&s;ions and revelations</HI> from the Lord God. The <HI>death of Louis</HI> XVI. and the removal of the Engli&s;h crown from the king's head, to a level with the ground, according to the &s;eventh chapter of Daniel; the fall of the queen's palace, and the de&s;truction of the tower; your own removal from admini&s;tration, and af|terwards death, was among the things which I informed you of, would mo&s;t certainly come to pa&s;s as the evil con&s;equences of this delu&s;ive war.

<P>When I informed you that England would en|ter into this war, and the con&s;equences which would, in de&s;pite of all your efforts, flow from it, <HI>you de&s;pi&s;ed me;</HI> for, at that time, the war was not intended; and to tell of evils that would mo&s;t certainly en&s;ue from a thing, when the thing they were to proceed from was not de&s;ign|ed, were to you the effects of folly and deceit.</P>
<P>My knowledge of future things is given me from God; therefore what I wrote was true: A little time longer, and England will be &s;o much entangled as not to be able to go forward without feeling the pains of that <HI>colonial conque&s;t</HI> which is to be the cau&s;e of her death; nor to retire, with|out falling under that foreign blow, which will

<P>Neither evil can be prevented, and both will take place, to fulfil the <HI>judgment of God,</HI> accord|ing to the prophecy of Daniel and revelation of St. John; <HI>unle&s;s what I write is believed to be tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the advice I give is &s;trictly followed.</HI> Fleets and armies are great things to talk of, becau&s;e terrible to de&s;troy mankind; but, when oppo&s;ed by the power of Heaven, they become weak, they lo&s;e their force and terror; for mo&s;t of tho&s;e in Europe are de&s;tined for the rocks and the flames&punc; They are permitted to conquer a little for a &s;hort time now; but it is, like Ru&s;&s;ia and Germany, to ha&s;ten that dreadful fall of human government which will &s;oon take place in the world: for they ever have been, in the hand of God, the very in|&s;truments to effect what princes de&s;igned to pre|vent.</P>

<P>The Lord God commands me to acknowledge the kindne&s;s of a poor woman, that brought me a three-penny loaf each week, every Monday morning, when I was in pri&s;on Her name is I&s;abella Wake. The pri&s;on is Newgate.</P>
<P>A man that died the day before, of a bad fever, and from neglect, for the want of proper nouri&s;h|ment, as I was told, made a vacancy in a room, with fourteen poor men, little air, and much crouded, for me to come into his place.</P>
<P>The &s;mall, very &s;mall pennyworth of bread, with water only, except one day in the week, when there are a few ounces of beef, for twen|ty-four hours, is barely &s;ufficient to keep life and body together. The pri&s;on is very clo&s;e; there is not room enough to promote health, by the ne|ce&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e of walking: there are no coals al|lowed
<PB N="66" REF="028359_0065_0FD8C5CF22B93C88">
for fire, nor candles for light. There is no bed to lie on, nor blanket to cover one; The poor are entirely de&s;titute here.</P>
<P>When the condition of pri&s;ons, and the treat|ment of pri&s;oners, is required for public informa|tion, it is from the poor man, who&s;e health is in|jured by confinement, who has to draw his little air through a &s;mall iron-barred window, who has but a &s;mall pennyworth of bread allowed for the whole day to live on, that a true account is to be received; but certainly not from the officers, keepers, and contractors, who live in plenty, who&s;e emoluments &s;well in proportion as the pri|&s;ons grow crouded.</P>
<P>Therefore be no longer a&s;toni&s;hed that Lon|don, in one part of the Revelation is called un|der the name of the great city, <HI>for &s;he is the great|e&s;t city in Europe, and the riche&s;t in the world;</HI> in another part &s;he is called Sodom; and in a third, &s;he is, as well as Rome, <HI>&s;piritually called</HI> Babylon the Great.</P>
<P>No man, who has any knowledge of God, can ju&s;tly &s;ay, that London is without guilt, and her people are without &s;in; when her &s;treets are full of vice, and her pri&s;ons are full of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>All this has been told me by revelation, from the Lord God, in vi&s;ions of the night.</P>
<P>There are many of my family, which have heard of me, and with which the Spirit of God has given me favour, that do not want either in|clination or ability to demon&s;trate their friend&s;hip; but they are deterred, from a fear of offending government, and from a fear of incurring the im|putation of guilt, by being generous.</P>
<P>The pre-ordained and de&s;igned &s;ignet of peace for all nations, cannot do any thing that will ulti|mately tend to injure any prince, government, or individual: if they view his words in a contrary light, it is becau&s;e they calculate the future by the pa&s;t; they know the things which were la&s;t month, but have no knowledge of tho&s;e things which are to be the next.

<P>The Elijah, mentioned in this chapter, and the me&s;&s;enger, mentioned in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the third chapter, mean two di&s;tinct per&s;ons. The one was the immediate me&s;&s;enger of Chri&s;t, when he came for the &s;alvation of mankind; the other, his recorded prophet, to pronounce his judgments, and warn the world, before he comes to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>This is that great prophet, alluded to in the chapter, under the name of Elijah, and not St. John the Bapti&s;t: he will po&s;&s;e&s;s the Spirit of God equal to Elijah, and have the power of his fire in the &s;ame manner.

<P>The appointment of this prophet, being to in|vite fir&s;t, and compel after, all nations to come into the kingdom of peace, as a nece&s;&s;ary prepa|ration to meet Chri&s;t, when he comes to vi&s;it and judge the world: St. John the Bapti&s;t, for being appointed to prepare for Chri&s;t, preaching the &s;ame kingdom of peace, and promi&s;ing, by bap|ti&s;m, mercy to all that would believe, is the real and very rea&s;on, that Chri&s;t, in the &s;eventeenth chapter of St. Matthew, calls him Elias.</P>
<P>At a former time, when I was entreating God to &s;pare London, I mentioned no man by his ti|tle: but when I was writing an account of it for public information, he &s;aid to me, "unle&s;s you write their titles, they them&s;elves wont know who you mean." It will appear &s;trange, becau&s;e I am not acquainted with any of the di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons alluded to; but I knew every one by &s;ome particular act that caught my approbation, and made me remember them then. It &s;eemed as if God had done this on purpo&s;e, for he has often &s;aid to me &s;ince, in vi&s;ions and revelations at night, You mu&s;t be a wall of defence and &s;afe|ty to many a great man;&mdash;yes, even to &s;ome that de&s;pi&s;e you now.

the name of William Pitt, I pa&s;&s;ed by that of his brother; immediately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great &s;oftne&s;s and good nature, &s;aid, There is <HI>John Pitt,</HI> won't you mention him? You don't know who he is <HI>I forgave.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun fir&s;t, (although I always had a pre&s;entiment of being &s;ometime or other very great) to enlighten my under&s;tanding, and teach me to di&s;tingui&s;h right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and con&s;idering that voluntary &s;wear|ing, which I was obliged to comply with, every &s;ix months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unnece&s;&s;ary, unju&s;t, and wicked, I reque&s;t|ed to be indulged with permi&s;&s;ion to receive it without; &s;tating at the &s;ame time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own rea&s;ons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in an&s;wer to my reque&s;t, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to di&s;pen&s;e with it.</P>
<P>Soon after this I made another reque&s;t, &s;up|porting my objections to voluntary &s;wearing, with ob&s;erving, That if the <HI>order of council</HI> en|forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, &s;wore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act&mdash;<HI>the re|&s;ult
<PB N="72" REF="028359_0071_0FD8C5E549F66270">
of his own free will</HI>&mdash;would it not in the &s;ight of God in heaven, and every <HI>man</HI> of di&s;cernment under him on earth, amount to a fal&s;e oath?</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons with the&s;e objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, &s;tating their in&s;ufficient power to di&s;pen&s;e with the u&s;ual form of &s;wearing, I publi&s;hed at that time in the new&s;|paper called the <HI>Public Adverti&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>During the time of my writing officially to the admiralty, I had occa&s;ion to write al&s;o to the pre&s;ident, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;wearing which led me to make an application, I remarked to him; that as men, whether few in number, or the encrea&s;ed multitude of a &s;enate were not infalli|ble, they mu&s;t con&s;equently be &s;ubject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this a&s;&s;ertion, and likewi&s;e to impre&s;s a conviction of its ju&s;tice, I mentioned among other things a deci&s;ion of the privy coun&s;el relative to a native of Gla&s;gow, who had his &s;hip &s;eized in the We&s;t Indies for an <HI>unde&s;igned</HI> infringement of the Navigation act.</P>
<P>After a legal inve&s;tigation in that country, it was clearly proved and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the regi&s;ter might authorize the &s;eizure, it could not ju&s;tify a condemnation; becau&s;e the commander, <HI>like an hone&s;t man,</HI> &s;hewed it at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</P>
<P>An appeal was lodged again&s;t this acquittal by
<PB N="73" REF="028359_0072_0FD8C5E8E4BE76B0">
the &s;eizing officer in the We&s;t Indies, and brought before the privy council in England!&mdash;the &s;hip was condemned.</P>
<P>To con&s;titute a high court of equity, its mem|bers, to pronounce their judgment agreeable to that very name their exi&s;tence as a court is de|rived from, mu&s;t be governed more by the <HI>inten|tion</HI> than the pre&s;umptive proof. But to con&s;ti|tute a court of law, its judges mu&s;t be directed by the expre&s;s letter of the act of parliament un|der which they officiate.</P>
<P>For example, two men go into a fore&s;t; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a pre&s;umptive proof of murder, and the law very ju&s;tly brings the &s;urvivor to trial. But <HI>equity,</HI> viewing this circum&s;tance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Another, and more relevant to the &s;eizure. A man buys a &s;tamp, to legali&s;e a bond for the bet|ter &s;ecurity of trading with his money, <HI>or in plainer language, lending it on intere&s;t;</HI> to be cer|tain that this &s;tamp is warrantably ju&s;t, accord|ing to the pre&s;cribed forms of law, he &s;hews it at the &s;tamp-office, where it is acknowledged to be good and &s;afe: after this, in con&s;equence of &s;ome defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder &s;ubjected to a penalty.</P>
<P>I believe every man on earth, that has the com|mon
<PB N="74" REF="028359_0073_0FD8C5EA6ED71AA8">
faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing white from black, will agree with me in &s;aying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that he had no knowledge of as &s;uch, and for what was authorized by the very office of go|vernment that always i&s;&s;ued the &s;tamps.</P>
<P>The law &s;uppo&s;es criminality from the appear|ance; but equity mea&s;ures it from the de&s;ign. The one is external and vi&s;ible, provided many years before it may be wanted: the one is inter|nal and &s;piritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es prudence, learning, and penetration.</P>
<P>When I was writing of the&s;e things to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees I made a &s;olemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be plea&s;ed to enable me, I would mo&s;t &s;urely procure an indemnification for the poor man that lo&s;t his &s;hip. Since that time the Lord God has told me, by revelation at night, That he would mo&s;t truly enable me: for if I liked, I &s;hould be Pre&s;ident of the Council, and Chancellor of the Exchequer: I &s;hould have any thing that I re|quired. Immediately after this, I heard another voice from heaven, &s;ay, The Lord have mercy on them, if they had not you for their friend and coun&s;ellor; for England is the Spiritual Egypt mentioned in the eleventh chapter of the Reve|lation to St. John.</P>
<P>After making the numerous repre&s;entations I
<PB N="75" REF="028359_0074_0FD8C5EF055130D8">
have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their ju&s;tice &s;o far as to era&s;e the word <HI>Voluntary</HI> from the pre&s;crib|ed form of &s;wearing: but I was then reminded of the words of Chri&s;t in the 5th chapter, 34th ver&s;e of St. Matthew, and &s;trictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I reque&s;ted from the admiralty, and often repeated it, a di&s;pen&s;ing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</P>
<P>If the Earl of Chatham had &s;hewn me the &s;mall favour I a&s;ked for, and certainly it would have been but a very &s;mall one to him, he &s;hould be held up to the world, as my friend, to be ad|mired and regarded; he &s;hould wear &s;uch a du|rable coronet as would make him the envy of princes; it &s;hould be a coronet that no human power would ever be able to remove.</P>
<P>As the admiralty would not give me that rea|&s;onable indulgence I reque&s;ted, as they would not &s;hew me that kindne&s;s which, as men living by the navy, they might have done with ea&s;e, and without prejudice to their dignity; I wanted for a bit of bread to eat: I was be&s;ides treated &s;o ill, as to be dragged to a work hou&s;e without any legal authority, again&s;t every remon&s;trance I could make, and again&s;t every threat I could make u&s;e of to call them to a &s;trict account for the inju&s;tice. The admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by ordering what was
<PB N="76" REF="028359_0075_0FD8C5F1EC391738">
due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the payment of what was due, until open fal&s;ehood was made u&s;e of to &s;ay I was out of my &s;en&s;es. It &s;eemed as if they were under &s;ome private apprehen&s;ion, though plea&s;ed with my di&s;tre&s;s, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and wanted &s;ome kind of co|lourable evidence to ju&s;tify the proceeding.</P>
<P>Hear, therefore, all nations, and be warned by it, what the Lord God has told me by reve|lation, and now commands me to write, that the injuries I received, becau&s;e done for obeying his word in the ble&s;&s;ed, Go&s;pel, the remem|brance of them &s;hould never be blotted out from the throne of heaven. Moreover, he &s;aid, like|wi&s;e, that he would &s;hake the Engli&s;h admiralty as a man would violently bread in a ba&s;ket, un|til he loo&s;ed the foundations of the earth, and &s;hook the place in pieces.</P>
<P>If I am out of my &s;en&s;es, in the opinion of the admiralty, for refu&s;ing, fir&s;t to take an idle oath, &s;econdly, a fal&s;e one, and thirdly, to take any: Chri&s;t, the Saviour of the world, and him that I&s;aiah the prophet calls Wonderful Coun|&s;ellor, who prohibits by his Go&s;pel in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms all kind of &s;wearing, mu&s;t, by the &s;ame rule of knowledge for giving &s;uch a com|mand, be out of his.</P>

<HEAD>The following are &s;ome more of the <HI>VISIONS,</HI> which God &s;hewed me, and which I am com|manded to publi&s;h here.</HEAD>
<P>In the month called July, 1791, I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God to the &s;ea coa&s;t, in the Engli&s;h channel&mdash;a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an in|&s;tant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quick|ne&s;s, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the &s;ame time,
<Q>SWEDE! SWEDE!</Q></P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spi|rit of God to Sweden, when I was made look

through a window in a room; I did, and &s;aw a man walk from the &s;ide of a great chair, leaving it empty. I could not &s;ee his face as he went away, and although I could perceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with my&s;elf that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the an|gel that &s;tood by me &s;aid, The chair means the chair of &s;tate; and that man you &s;aw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <HI>delivered over for death,</HI> and that is the very man that will &s;hoot him.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is clo&s;ely pur&s;ued like|wi&s;e, but he is not delivered over yet.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion, and &s;aw the Pru&s;|&s;ian eagle perched on a chair of &s;tate? &s;oon after, on a &s;udden, I &s;aw the chair, the hou&s;e, and the whole city where the chair &s;tood, in flames. The angel that was near me, &s;aid, he is likewi&s;e pur|&s;ued now.</P>
<P>After this I was in a vi&s;ion, and the Lord God talked with me, and &s;aid, I give you the life of the Swede: but know this for certain, that if yov prevent his death, the man him&s;elf will not be|lieve there was any danger of it. And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an impo&s;ter, a fool, and a liar: you will be impri&s;oned, and treated very ill. When I &s;ee this it will make me angry; I will then be|gin to kill the people, and I will &s;urely de&s;troy this city.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028359_0084_0FD8C6086F3FA078">For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevented his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army again&s;t France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, clo&s;e by the &s;ea coa&s;t, to be &s;upplied the ea&s;ier with provi&s;ions from England, and endeavour by all po&s;&s;ible means, to take the harbour of Bre&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;aid to him&s;elf, in his own clo&s;et, this is the plan I will pur&s;ue; It will be giving a mor|tal blow to the French navy, and getting a &s;afe harbour for our own &s;hips.</P>
<P>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and mini&s;ter of &s;tate in 1792, &s;ome time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor|mandy, &s;hewed any open appearance of ho&s;ti|lity again&s;t the pre&s;ent government of France.</P>
<P>In the month of April 1793, I was in a vi&s;ion, and was carried away in the &s;pirit of God to Ru&s;&s;ia, where I &s;aw a bear &s;top to re&s;t it&s;elf un|der a large tree; &s;oon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches drop down &s;oftly, and with a &s;harp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, &s;tab the bear; pronouncing, as he did &s;o, I have watched a long time for you, but now, I have caught you at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I know, by revelation from the Lord God, that this vi&s;ion means the pre&s;ent empre&s;s of
<PB N="86" REF="028359_0085_0FD8C60D85BBE928">
Ru&s;&s;ia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</P>
<P>Let the death of the king of Sweden and France which is but a little time pa&s;t; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will &s;oon take place, for they are pur&s;ued; convince the princes and the people of Europe, that the &s;eventh chap|ter of Daniel and the &s;econd of Haggai are now fulfilling.</P>
<P>At a former time, when, the Lord God was in|&s;tructing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am appointed to govern, he &s;aid, in a vi&s;ion of the night, when I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above kings of the earth&mdash;Be &s;ober, be mode&s;t, be rea|&s;onable. And immediately after he added, you may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a vi&s;ion, and &s;aw the &s;un in its full &s;trength, clear and high up in the firmament: &s;oon after I &s;aw another &s;un ri&s;e on a &s;udden, equally large as the former, and &s;tand clo&s;e by it; both &s;hone with equal brightne&s;s, and the la&s;t as well as the fir&s;t enlight|ened the world.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of this copy was &s;ent to be printed, and even &s;ome of it done, the printer was advi&s;ed not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, pro&s;ecution, impri&s;onment, and
<PB N="87" REF="028359_0086_0FD8C60E6429CC18">
perhaps hanging, would be the con&s;equence to him. For which the Lord God commands me to keep back the additional information that otherways would be given, and terminate the book.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid already that the &s;ixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <HI>four fir&s;t &s;eals</HI> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound &s;ecret un|til the pre&s;ent time, is removed: <HI>recorded</HI> decrees are held up, and God him&s;elf commands a know|ledge of their contents to be publi&s;hed for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judg|ments, printed exactly as I write, how is this ex|ten&s;ion of mercy to be known over Europe, and the people of London informed of any danger that is pa&s;t or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given by men: the Ninevites were warned through one.</P>
<P>How is the king to &s;ave him&s;elf from that <HI>re|corded,</HI> determined, unavoidable death, which all the powers of armies cannot prevent? How is Lon|don and the parliament to be &s;aved, when they are recorded in the &s;cripture of truth to be de&s;troyed? How is England, Europe, and mo&s;t parts of the world to be &s;aved, when they are recorded to be fil|led with blood by war, and to be made de&s;olate for ever by earthquakes, if the per&s;on I employ is de|trered
<PB N="88" REF="028359_0087_0FD8BD6CC07E4050">
by the fears of per&s;ecution and evil, from printing the full copy, exactly as I give it?</P>
<P>The king of Egypt and his people were de|&s;troyed, becau&s;e they would not believe Mo&s;es; but the king of Nineveh and his people were &s;aved, becau&s;e they did believe Jonah and re|form.</P>
<P>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, other members of admini&s;tration, and as many members of both hou&s;es of parliament, as my ability will allow; the bi&s;hops, judges, and all the foreign amba&s;|&s;adors in London; will have a book &s;ent to each.</P>
<P>On account of my being in&s;ulted, becau&s;e the Jews do not believe in the fir&s;t book, by a public acknowledgment of it, the Lord God commands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to &s;ay, that as the Jews do not be|lieve in Chri&s;t, it cannot he expected that they will in me; <HI>neither are they,</HI> until I am revealed in a &s;imilar manner to Mo&s;es in Egypt, but with the additional power of fire as his &s;ign, to make them.</P>
<P>The night before I had fini&s;hed this book for the pre&s;s, the Lord God &s;hewed it to me in a vi|&s;ion, ready printed, holding it up at the &s;ame time by one leaf, and &s;haking all the others open, while he pronounced, in &s;trong clear words, and commanded me to writ them down exactly as he &s;poke, for univer&s;al information:</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="028359_0088_0FD8C616A72AB008">There is nothing in this book that the Engli&s;h law can take hold of:&mdash;So &s;ays him that I&s;aiah the prophet calls Wonderful Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t every body, in all nations, to read this book with attention, and receive it favoura|bly; for although the information and warning it contains is through me, yet it is not mine, but God's.</P>

<P N="46">46. Then &s;aid I to the angel, what young per|&s;on is that which crowns them, and gives them palms in their hands.

<P>The Son of God, alluded to here, is not the Saviour, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as has been al|ways erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed; but a human being, of fle&s;h and blood, like any other. It is a man, and but a man; though recorded, and honoured with being called the Son of God.

As a believer in God, <HI>by, and through Chri&s;t, the divine Spirit of Truth,</HI> and an obeyer of his commands, he is a &s;on, an adopted &s;on: &s;o is every man under heaven an acknowledged &s;on, whether rich or poor, that does the &s;ame; and &s;o is every woman likewi&s;e, an adopted, an acknowledged daughter.</P>
<P>Remember the words of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel, where he &s;ays, after this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father which art in hea|ven, &amp;c. As God then is our father, we, that acknowledge and pray to him as &s;uch, are &s;urely his &s;ons and daughters.</P>
<P>All that believe in the te&s;timony of God by me, which he now commands me to make known, are his people, a part <HI>(becau&s;e the vi&s;ible Jews are the great body)</HI> of that innumerable multitude, &s;hewn by the angel to E&s;dras, crowned, and re|ceiving palms.</P>
<P>The Lord God commands me to remind all people of the loud thunder that was on the 7th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, and to &s;ay, it was a threat from him to de&s;troy London, &s;ooner than &s;uffer me to be hurt: take it for a warning, and beware of the dreadful con&s;equences that will mo&s;t certain|ly en&s;ue, if a &s;imilar injury is intended again&s;t me: for if you, the Engli&s;h Government, is de|termined to mole&s;t me, the Lord God is al&s;o de|termined

<HEAD>Other Parts of the Revelation to St. John which are to be fulfilled, and which the Lord God com|mands me now to publi&s;h.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xiii. 1. And I &s;tood upon the &s;and of the &s;ea, and &s;aw a bea&s;t ri&s;e up out of the &s;ea, having &s;even heads and ten horns; and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of Bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>This bea&s;t means the Engli&s;h monarchy; and it is by &s;hips and commerce that it has ro&s;e from the &s;ea to &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing grandeur and magni|tude. The heads, horns, and crowns, allude to the many departments of government, and their &s;plendid di&s;tinctions. The Bla&s;phemy means the titles given to, and a&s;&s;umed by the king of England; &s;uch as, Our mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign Lord, &s;acred Per&s;on, Maje&s;ty, defender of the Faith, and &s;upreme head of the Church; all which names belong to God, he only can be what they expre&s;s, and when they are applied to any other, the &s;in is bla&s;phemy in his &s;ight.</P>
<P N="2">2 And the bea&s;t which I &s;aw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his &s;eat, and great authority.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h monarchy, for being &s;upreme head of the Church, and over the many religious &s;ects tolerated in the country, is the rea&s;on that it is,
<PB N="130" REF="028359_0129_0FD8C69EDD864210">
for their great number, compared to a leopard full of &s;pots.</P>
<P>As a bear is very &s;trong on his feet, &s;o is the Engli&s;h monarchy: and as a lion roars with his mouth the loude&s;t of any bea&s;t, &s;o does the En|gli&s;h monarchy proclaim its greatne&s;s more than any other.</P>
<P N="3">3. And I &s;aw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the bea&s;t.</P>
<P>The beginning of this ver&s;e means the death of Charles the fir&s;t, king of England: and the dead|ly wound being healed, means the recovery of monarchy by the re&s;toration of Charles the &s;econd. During the interval of time between the death and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, all the world wondered if the Engli&s;h monarchy would ever be re&s;tored again.</P>
<P N="9">9. If any man have an ear let him hear. He that leads into captivity, &s;hall go into captivity: he that kills with the &s;word mu&s;t be killed with the &s;word. Here is the patience and the faith of the &s;aints.</P>
<P>The leading into captivity means impri&s;onment and &s;lavery: and killing with the &s;word, means violence and war. The patience of the &s;aints is, to bear quietly with tho&s;e evils, and to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of wealth to do them: All that have faith in God will not do &s;uch things, from a be|lief that they are offen&s;ive, becau&s;e he commands them not.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="131" REF="028359_0130_0FD8C6808E9A4030">11. And I beheld another bea&s;t coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake as a dragon.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e means the Elector of Hanover. Coming up out of the earth, is to &s;ignify that his country or government is &s;ituated inland. The horns of a lamb, and the voice of a dragon, means that although he is weak in power like a lamb, yet by his voice he can threaten in great and mighty words like a dragon.</P>
<P N="12">12. And he exerci&s;eth all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t before him, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It means the elector of Hanover's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, place, and power of the former king of England. To fulfil this part of the pro|phecy given by revelation to St. John, the utter expul&s;ion of the Stuart family mu&s;t again&s;t all human oppo&s;ition have taken place to admit the elector of Hanover.</P>
<P>A great part of this chapter is taken up in de&s;cribing the king and parliament. I am com|manded to inform both of the recorded judg|ments of God, the dangers which threaten them, and their certainty of taking place, unle&s;s they implore him for mercy, and obtain it.</P>
<P>They have individually promi&s;ed, by their god|fathers and godmothers, in the &s;acred covenant of bapti&s;m, and acknowledge a confirmation of it by receiving the &s;acrament, (for both were in|&s;tituted by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) to believe in
<PB N="132" REF="028359_0131_0FD8C6A01C54A7B0">
him and obey his commands; yet, notwith&s;tand|ing this heavie&s;t of all obligations which a hu|man being can enter into, (for it is with his God,) and on the performance of which his &s;al|vation depends, the laws they make a part of the Thirty nine Articles, and &s;ome of the forms of prayer, u&s;ed in public wor&s;hip, goes more to break the covenant of bapti&s;m, to di&s;honour God, and oppo&s;e an obedience to his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, than was ever authori&s;ed in any other nation.</P>
<P>Without &s;ubmitting to the forms of law pre|&s;cribed by act of parliament, which are in direct oppo&s;ition to the commands of Chri&s;t, and very &s;inful to do, no man can hold any place of profit or tru&s;t, enjoy the privilege of freedom, and comparatively to buy or &s;ell.</P>
<P N="17">17. And that no man might buy or &s;ell, &s;ave he that had the mark, or the name of the bea&s;t, or the number of his name.</P>
<P N="18">18. Here is wi&s;dom. Let him that has un|der&s;tanding count the number of the bea&s;t: for it is the number of a man; and his number is &s;ix hundred three&s;core and &s;ix.</P>
<P>This ver&s;e means the the Engli&s;h parliament; and although it exceeds the number mentioned here, yet notwith&s;tanding, it is the real and very a&s;&s;embly of men alluded to in the Revelation, by the number of 666.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the parliament acknowledge and ad|dre&s;s the king by the divine names which belong
<PB N="133" REF="028359_0132_0FD8C682AA1C70F8">
only to God; &s;uch as, our mo&s;t gracious Sove|reign Lord, Sire, Maje&s;ty, and honour him with equal humility in &s;upplication, when they require any thing, as if he really was the Lord of heaven and earth; &s;uch as, Humbly praying that your Maje&s;ty would be mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, &amp;c. Therefore God, in his great anger, being jea|lous of his name and honour, calls the king a bea&s;t, and the parliament his image and number.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xiv. 1. And I looked, and lo, a lamb &s;tood on Mount Sion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thou&s;and, having his father's name written in their fore-heads</P>
<P>The lamb, mentioned here, means my&s;elf as Prince of the Hebrews; and Mount Sion, Jeru|&s;alem: the hundred and forty-four thou&s;and with me, having the name of my father wrote in their foreheads, means not only the vi&s;ible Jews of the twelve tribe, but likewi&s;e the invi&s;ible&mdash;it com|prehends all of Hebrew extraction that will be|lieve in the te&s;timony of God by me.</P>
<P N="6">6.

<P N="2">2. And the fir&s;t went, and poured out his vi|al upon the earth; and there fell a noi&s;ome and grievous &s;ore upon the men which had the mark of the bea&s;t, and on them which wor&s;hipped his image. And the &s;econd angel poured out his vial upon the &s;ea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living &s;oul died in the &s;ea.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="135" REF="028359_0134_0FD8C684341EBA48">4. And the third angel poured out his vial up|on the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.

<P N="10">10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the &s;eat of the bea&s;t, and his kingdom was full of darkne&s;s, and they gnawed their tongues for pain; and bla&s;phemed the God of heaven, becau&s;e of their pains and their &s;ores, and repent|ed not of their deeds.</P>
<P><HI>Chap.</HI> xxi. 6. And he &s;aid to me, it is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: I will give to him that is a-thir&s;t of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he &s;hall be my &s;on.</P>
