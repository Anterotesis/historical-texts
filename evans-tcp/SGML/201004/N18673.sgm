<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Rights <HI>of</HI> Animals: An <HI>ORATION,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of my appearing in public, at this time, is to &s;ay a few things in favor of a cer|tain cla&s;s of beings, who&s;e rights have &s;el|dom been advocated, either from the pulpit, from the &s;tage, or from the pre&s;s. I mean the INFERIOR ANIMALS.</P>
<P>THE cruelty, and inju&s;tice, with which this cla&s;s of beings has been treated, by their boa&s;ted &s;uperi|ors of the human race, is too notorious to need a particular recital. In general, their welfare and hap|pine&s;s has been looked upon as a matter of very little importance, in the &s;y&s;tem; and in our treat|ment of them, hardly to be regarded. And one &s;pe|cies, in particular, has, by almo&s;t univer&s;al con&s;ent, been totally excluded from any place in the benevo|lent regards of mankind: So that now, "who&s;o|ever killeth them, thinketh that he doth God &s;er|vice." Yea, and many are &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that this is a fulfilment of that antient prophecy, "That the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;er|pent's head."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024242_0004_0FC57A76B6C78F40">
AS every &s;inful indulgence, and every act of inju&s;|tice, ari&s;es from the blind and criminal &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the human heart; to this mu&s;t we look, as the cau&s;e of that unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition, together with all tho&s;e acts of inju&s;tice and cruelty, which are &s;pent upon the inferior animals. It is the nature of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, to exclude all beings but our&s;elves, and tho&s;e whom we con&s;ider as being related to our&s;elves, from any friendly, benevolent attention. If WE are exer|ci&s;ed with any pain, or are the &s;ubjects of any mi&s;|fortune: or, if this be the ca&s;e with any of tho&s;e, who belong to our FAMILY, or the circle of our FRIENDS, we immediately become affected by it: And always in proportion to the nearne&s;s of the re|lation. Whereas, if any calamity befall tho&s;e, who are no way related to us, but who belong to a differ|ent cla&s;s, or circle in &s;ociety, our feelings are not wont to be intere&s;ted. This will account, at once, for that di&s;po&s;ition and conduct in men, which we are now cen&s;uring. For the lower order of &s;ensible beings, are con&s;idered as moving in a very different &s;phere, and belonging to a community of a far dif|ferent nature from that of ours; &s;o far different, that the feelings of benevolence, are, commonly, not at all intere&s;ted in their favor.</P>
<P>A well known circum&s;tance, which attends &s;ome of the&s;e animals, contributes, not a little, to confirm us in the truth of this ob&s;ervation. For tho&s;e of them which are tamed, and dome&s;ticated by us, im|mediately become the objects of our kind regards,
<PB N="5" REF="024242_0005_0FC57A79F00B7040">and our &s;en&s;ibility is deeply wounded, when they are abu&s;ed. But where there is no &s;uch relation, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to u&s;e a phra&s;e denoting cruelty, they are treated LIKE BRUTES. Without the lea&s;t regard to ju&s;|tice, we commonly treat them in that manner, which we &s;uppo&s;e, will make them conduce the mo&s;t to our own advantage; and &s;ubject them, in all things, to what happens to be our plea&s;ure. Though &s;ome|times, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that our malevo|lence towards them, is of a di&s;intere&s;ted nature, and they are tormented only for the &s;ake of the unna|tural plea&s;ure, which is taken in doing it.</P>
<P>NOW, in order to determine, in what light, the&s;e animals ought to be con&s;idered, and how they ought to be treated, let us carefully attend to a few things, of known and acknowledged truth, with regard to the objects of our benevolence. And here, I think, it is pa&s;t di&s;pute, that all beings, capable of happine&s;s belong to the number. Let their circum&s;tances or characters, di&s;po&s;itions or abilities, color or &s;hape, be what they may; if they are &s;en&s;ible beings, and capable of happine&s;s, they ought to be the objects of our benevolent regards. If the moral character of any being has become hateful, and incon&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice, we cannot, tis true, as &s;uch, have any compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cency in it: But, we ob&s;erve, that the Bring it&s;elf, may, neverthele&s;s, be as proper an ob|ject of our benevolence, as any being whatever: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ought to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, and actually endeavor, to pro|mote
<PB N="6" REF="024242_0006_0FC57A7AEF3870A0">the welfare, and real happine&s;s of &s;uch a being, as much as we po&s;&s;ibly can, con&s;i&s;tently with the rights and claims of other beings. This is the na|true of true benevolence. True benevolence is uni|ver&s;al, and uniform. The good man, like his mer|ciful Creator, wi&s;hes to promote the highe&s;t happi|ne&s;s of that &s;y&s;tem to which his influence extends: And feels devoted to PARTIES in &s;ociety, no far|ther than the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and his limited capacities render it nece&s;&s;ary. We may, and ought to have a true regard for all beings, according to their real worth, and to wi&s;h them well, according to their capacity for enjoyment&punc; although, in this life, we are nece&s;&s;arily limited in the execution of &s;uch bene|volent wi&s;hes. The ca&s;e is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h with us, at pre&s;ent, that we canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to all beings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to whom, neverthele&s;s, we may wi&s;h well, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;incerity, and with equal a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r.

<P>THESE ob&s;ervations, it is hoped, will help us to determine, in what light, we ought to confider the INFERIOR ANIMALS. That they are &s;en&s;ible be|ings, and capable of happine&s;s, none can doubt: That their &s;en&s;ibility of corporeal plea&s;ure and pain, is le&s;s than ours, none can prove<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Millepedes rolls it&s;elf round upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighte&s;t touch; and the Snail draws in her horns upon the fir&s;t approach of the hand.

<P>BUT le&s;t this mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of rea&s;oning &s;hould be thought too ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, let us call into view a rule of judging, in|&s;tituted by a divine Philanthropi&s;t, and oracle of wi&s;dom, in the days of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Cae&s;ar. "That we do to others as we would have them do unto us;" i. e. in a change of circum&s;tances. This is a maxim which approves it&s;elf to the rea&s;on and con&s;cience of every man. Whatever ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urity may involve other rules of judging, this is always clear, and un|exceptionable. And it mu&s;t extend to all &s;en&s;ible beings, with whom we have any dealings, and in who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tuation we are capable of imagining our&s;elves to be. Suppo&s;ing therefore, (as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed,) that the doctrine of tran&s;migration is true, and that, after this life, we &s;hall pa&s;s into the forms of &s;ome of the inferior animals, and move in their &s;phere; how &s;hould we wi&s;h to be con&s;idered, and treated, by tho&s;e above us? Here, there is left not the lea&s;t room to doubt, what our feelings would be. Let this rule, therefore, be faithfully applied, in every ca&s;e, and cruelty to animals would no longer be in|dulged.</P>

<P>THUS &s;aith the Poet. And I know of nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nature, in rea&s;on, or in revelation, which obliges us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the UNALIENATED rights of a bea&s;t, are not as &s;acred, and inviolable, as tho&s;e of a man: or that the per&s;on, who wantonly commits an outrage upon the life, happine&s;s, or &s;ecurity of a BIRD, is not as really amenable, at the tribunal of eternal ju&s;tice, as he, who wantonly de&s;troys the rights and privileges, or injuriou&s;ly takes away the life of one of his fellow creatures of the HUMAN race. Here, perhaps, &s;ome of my auditory will feel &s;hocked: and will recur, in their minds, to that horror, and de&s;paration, which ari&s;es in the brea&s;ts of murderers: Whereas, there is no &s;uch con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of guilt, when one of the inferior animals only has been the &s;ubject of human cruelty. But this dif|ference, I would ob&s;erve, is owing to education, and to certain contracted habits of thinking and acting. Only let a per&s;on be taught, from his earlie&s;t years, that it is criminal to torment, and unnece&s;&s;arily to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;troy, the&s;e innocent animals, and he will feel a guilty con&s;cience, in con&s;equence of any injury, which he &s;hall do them, in this way, no le&s;s really,
<PB N="10" REF="024242_0010_0FC57A84D8BD4080">than if the injury were offered to human beings.

Witne&s;s the cruelties, and the deaths, which are inflicted upon them, in the We&s;t-Indies, and in the Southern States; and witne&s;s the indifference, with which, in &s;ome countries, they kill their children, when they become too nu|merous, and their parents, when they become too old.

<P>AND now, let rea&s;on judge-does not the idle, and mi&s;chievous boy, who, to gratif, him&s;elf, climbs the tree, and wantonly de&s;troys the habitation, and murders the family, of an innocent Sparrow, as re|ally tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of ju&s;tice, and is he not as really guilty of incompa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion, as the unfeeling wretch, who, to make him&s;elf the &s;ecure and un&s;u&s;|pected owner of a little trea&s;ure, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h he has &s;e|cretly removed, &s;ets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re to his neighbour's hou&s;e?

And all this is for no other rea&s;on, in the univer&s;e, but to gratify them|&s;elves with the terror and di&s;may, the labor and fa|tigue, the &s;creams and death, of this unfortunate creature!</P>

<P>WHAT ideas &s;hould we form of Superior beings, who&s;e employment, or rather, who&s;e AMUSE|MENT, it was, by certain invi&s;ible means, to en|&s;nare, worry, fatigue, and de&s;troy, the human race?

How then can we ju&s;tify our own con|duct, which is of the &s;ame complexion? But, to &s;how that &s;uch treatment of animals is wrong in it|&s;elf, enough has been &s;aid.

<P>THERE was a time, (it is &s;aid,) when, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the laws of England, all BUTCHERS were di&s;qualified from fitting, as jurymen, in any capital cau&s;e: Becau&s;e, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that being accu&s;tomed to &s;hed the blood, and take away the lives, of other animals, they would not have the feelings, common to the re&s;t of mankind, about the life of a man. Now, if this be the ca&s;e, where per&s;ons are accu&s;tomed to take away the lives of the&s;e animals, with decency, and humanity; what effect mu&s;t it have upon tho&s;e, with whom, allowed and voluntary acts of cruelty, have, through long indulgence, become habitual, and plea&s;ing?
