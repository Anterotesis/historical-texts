<P>IT is the great unhappine&s;s of our Age, that the greate&s;t part of men bu&s;ie them&s;elves mo&s;t in that which concerns them lea&s;t; look into the World, among&s;t rich end poor, high and low, young and old, and &s;ee whether it appear not by the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le &s;cope of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Conver&s;ations, that they &s;et more by &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mething el&s;e than Chri&s;t and Sal|vation &s;o they may have but &s;ome of the Earth in their Hands, they ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e for nothing of Heaven in their Hearts, though Gold can no more fill their Hearts than Grace their Pur&s;es.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Men are like the &s;illy Woman, that when her H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e was on fire, &s;o minded the &s;aving of her G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds, that &s;he left her Child ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting in the flames: at la&s;t being put in remembrance of it &s;he cries out, Oh my Child, my Child!

<P>There are many that are temporally Mi&s;era|ble, that are eternally Happy; and there are many that are temporally Happy, that &s;hall be eternally Mi&s;erable. Oh there is a great vanity in all worldly Excellencies; the Earth is big in Hopes, but little in our Hands; it cannot &s;atis|fie the Sen&s;es of Men, much le&s;s can it &s;atisfie the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>Dear Chri&s;tians, according to my Talent re|ceived, I have endeavoured to &s;et forth the Rich|es, the Loveline&s;s, the Preciou&s;ne&s;s and Excel|lencies

Why, <HI>Beloved,</HI> do you think he did not know it? yea, he knew it before he came into the World, how he &s;hould be u&s;ed in the World, that the <HI>Jews</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ld Crucifie him, and that <HI>Judas</HI> would be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.46.

And therefore, Sirs, 'tis your duty to live upon Pro|mi&s;es, while Providence &s;eems to run cro&s;s to Promi&s;es. Chri&s;t's love to you 'tis free love. All that he hath given you 'tis free, his grace is free, his love is free, his &s;alvation is free, his peace is free, and him&s;elf is free.

<P>Secondly, I &s;hall lay down this Argument to prove the <HI>Deity</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; con&s;ider the work of <HI>Creation;</HI> &s;urely he that made <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> mu&s;t needs be a God, you will yield to this, for &s;ays the Lord him&s;elf, <HI>All the Gods that have not made heaven and earth, &s;hall peri&s;h from the earth, and from under hea|ven,</HI> Jer. 10.11. But now, Beloved, Je&s;us Chri&s;t made the <HI>Heavens</HI> and the <HI>Earth,</HI> and all things therein, and therefore he is God:

<P N="3">3.

The&s;e are the things that make a Chri&s;tian &s;o excel|lent a per&s;on, and he hath none of tho&s;e but by Chri&s;t, and he hath all this alone by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This is the excellency of a Chri&s;tian, that he is a living man; there's no man on earth can in a &s;piritual &s;ence be called a liv|ing man, but a Believer; all men be dead men, but they that believe. You know 'twas &s;aid of the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> while he lived in his &s;in, he was dead: <HI>This my &s;on that was dead, &amp; is now alive.</HI> When he believed, then he was alive. Now, Sirs, as it is in the things of Nature, life is the mo&s;t valuable thing which we have, <HI>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</HI> a man will rather part with his liveli|hood than with his life, becau&s;e his life is &s;o dear to him. Now, Beloved, if natural life be &s;o de&s;irable a thing, what is &s;piritual life, that which is Scripture is call'd <HI>the life of God?</HI> Now the Believer is the only living man, every o|ther man is &s;piritually dead: but now how comes the Believer to live? by whom doth he live? why, <HI>'Tis Christ Je&s;us,</HI> Gal. 2.20. <HI>I am crucified with Chri&s;t, notwithstanding I live:</HI> What crucified, and yet live?

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The excellency of a Believer lies in this, That he is a &s;eeing man: 'tis &s;ight which puts the difference between per&s;on and per&s;on; it is a &s;ad thing to be born blind, or to be blind after a man is born.

Now in a &s;piritual fence, there's no man a &s;eeing man, but a Belie|ver; no man &s;aw Chri&s;t &s;avingly, but they who &s;aw him believingly; every man but a Believer walks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n darkne&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, he is darkne&s;s.

<ITEM>2. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;uffered by him&s;elf, but not for him&s;elf; he was alone in his &s;ufferings, neither Angles nor Saints bore any part with Chri&s;t in his &s;ufferings; no, he drank the bitter cup alone, <HI>He alone purged our &s;ins,</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>He alone by him&s;elf,</HI> &s;ays the Text, <HI>purg|ed ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ins.</HI> No, Chri&s;t had none to help to bear his heavy burden with him, he bare it him&s;elf alon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

This is the &s;econd Inference.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. My third is this, That it is more for Chri&s;t to &s;uffer any thing, than for all Men and Angles to &s;uffer all things. Pray mark <HI>Sirs,</HI> if all the Kings and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rours in the Earth &s;hould have left their T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rones, their Crowns, their Kingdoms, their Scepters, their Glory, their Honours, and Princely Robes, and have come and took upon them a poor <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s condition, to go poorly, &amp; fare

Now I &s;ay, it would not have been half &s;uch a won|der, if all the Angels in Heaven, and Men on Earth, had come and &s;uffered, as it was for the Son of God. Oh this is a wonder of won|ders, his &s;ufferings were wonderful, his humi|lity was wonderful, his patience was wonder|ful, his love was wonderful, greater love could none &s;hew; he loved us &s;o that he died for love. Now I be&s;eech you con&s;ider this Infe|rence, which was this, <HI>That it is more for Je&s;us Chri&s;t to &s;uffer any thing, than for all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n and An|gels to &s;uffer all things.</HI> And indeed Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, let me tell you, I want words to expre&s;s it, or &s;et it forth; for there is both want of words, and want in words to expre&s;s this matter.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. It robs us of our communion and fellow&s;hip with the Father, Son, and Spirit, &amp; makes us &s;trangers and aliens.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5. A fifth Inference is this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> brought life to us, but we brought death to him; a life of grace, a life of comfort, a life of glory: Chri&s;t brought glory to us, but we brought &s;hame to him: Chri&s;t brought riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to us, but we brought poverty to him; he brought joy to us, but we brought &s;orrow to him, &s;orrow upon &s;orrow: we put a Crown of Thorns upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s head, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> put the Crown of Glory upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heads.

The heart &s;hould be the fir&s;t that comes into duty, and the la&s;t that goes out of duty. Good words without the heart are but flattery, and good works without the heart are but hypocri&s;ie.

A heart without words, is better than words without a heart. A little done with the heart, is better than a great deal done without the heart.

<P>I &s;hall begin fir&s;t with the <HI>Barr of Ignorance,</HI> and in that I &s;hall &s;hew you the&s;e <HI>three things:</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What <HI>Ignorance</HI> is:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What <HI>Sinners</HI> are ignorant of:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of this <HI>Sin of Ignorance.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, What Ignorance is: Ignorance is the want of knowledge, or darkne&s;s of the un|der&s;tanding; for &s;o &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having the under&s;tanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, thro' the ig|norance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their heart.</HI> Here you may &s;ee what Igno|rance is; the Apo&s;tle calls it darkne&s;s and blindne&s;s: So likewi&s;e in 2 Cor. 3.4. <HI>But if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them, which believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</HI> So that Ignorance is darkne&s;s of mind, blindne&s;s of heart, and want of knowledge and &s;piritual under&s;tand|ing in the Soul.</P>
<P>Secondly, What are Sinners ignorant of?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer</HI> 1. They are ignorant of God, they are ignorant of Chri&s;t, they are ignorant of the Spirit, they are ignorant of the Word, they are ignorant of their own Mi&s;ery, they are ignorant of the nece&s;&s;ity of a Change, of being born again, of being new <HI>Creatures,</HI> of being converted and turned from darkne&s;s to light, from death to life, and from the power
<PB N="278" REF="001244_0143_0FB1862C2575D800">of Satan to the living God; &s;uch things as the&s;e, I &s;ay, they are ignorant of; and this is that which keeps poor &s;ouls from going to Chri&s;t. O Beloved! we have many of tho&s;e a|mong&s;t us, who are thus ignorant. It was &s;aid of the Prie&s;ts the Sons of <HI>Eli,</HI> that they were Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> and knew not the Lord, 1 <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI> 2.8. So in the Prophe&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Jeremiah, chap.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. It is &s;aid, the Prie&s;ts &s;aid not, where is the Lord? and they that handle the Law, know me not. So the Phari&s;ees were blind leaders of the blind, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14. Would to God there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch among&s;t us this day: May not that charge be drawn up again&s;t us now, as was again&s;t <HI>I&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">el? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;.</HI> 4.1. Becau&s;e there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; by &s;wearing, and lying, and killing, and &s;tealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood; therefore the land mourneth, and my people are de&s;troyed for lack of knowledge; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t rejected knowledge, I will al&s;o reject thee; &s;eeing thou ha&s;t forgotten the law of thy God, I will al&s;o forget thy children: they eat up the &s;ins of my people, and &s;et their hearts on their iniquity. Thus men err, not knowing the Scriptures, <HI>nor the power of God,</HI> Mat. 22.29.</P>

</LIST>
O cur&s;ed &amp; mi&s;|chievous Ignorance! What &s;in like unto this? This is that which darkens, which hardens, which blinds and barrs the door of Sinners hearts again&s;t Chri&s;t. O that thou had&s;t known (&s;aith our dear Lord) the things that belong to thy peace, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19 42. But becau&s;e they are a people of no under&s;tanding; therefore he that made them, will have no mercy on them: &amp; he that formed them, will &s;hew them no fa|vour, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 27.11.

<P>Secondly, The &s;econd Bar is Unbelief, which bars and bolts Chri&s;t out of the Heart: this is that which makes men.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P>O Friends! how much doth it concern you and me, to examine our &s;tanding, that we may be able to &s;tand in the day of Gods Wrath, which is coming &s;o fa&s;t upon us. O you &s;ee how that his Wrath is but a little kindled, &amp; yet how hard a matter is it for men to &s;tand, &amp; to abide it; Thou&s;ands have been &s;ent to their Graves by it, and many hundreds have left their Habitations, becau&s;e of it, and are fled out of the City, into &s;everal parts of this Kingdom for refuge. O what a &s;ad and doleful place hath this City been for &s;everal weeks pa&s;t! The greate&s;t Trade which bath been here among&s;t us, was to bury the dead, and tend the &s;ick. O now my Brethren, if this little be &s;o much, what will it be when the great day of his wrath is come! Who will then be able to &s;tand? O therefore examine your &s;elves, &amp; try your faith, examine your faith, whether it be true; your knowledge, whether it be &s;anctified; your hope, whether it be purified; your love, whe|ther it be &s;incere; your evidences, whether they be &s;ound; your hearts, whether they be gracious; your de&s;ires, whether they be ho|ly; your ends, whether they be right; &amp; your conver&s;ations, whether they be heavenly, that you may be able to &s;tand in the day of Wrath, in the day of Death, and in the day of Judg|ment, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5.</P>

<HI>U&s;e</HI> 3. By way of Exhortation. And I &s;hall be brief, le&s;t I &s;hould intrude too much upon your patience; but I hope you will not think the time long, for it may be the la&s;t Sermon that I may preach, or you hear. Well (Belov|ed) is it &s;o, that the greate&s;t part of men and women will not be able to &s;tand in the day of God's wrath? Give me leave therefore to ex|hort you to the&s;e three things:

O &s;inners, you have grievou&s;ly &s;inned again&s;t God, you have de&s;er|ved as many Hells, as you have committed Sins; you have &s;inned again&s;t his Mercies, you have abu&s;ed his Patience, you have re&s;i&s;ted his Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, you have not obeyed his Go&s;pel, you have made light of his Mini&s;ters, &amp; you have hated his Members.

O therefore, for God's &s;ake, and Chri&s;t's &s;ake, be ye prevailed withal; why will you die, &s;eeing God would have you live? why will you damn your &s;elves? why will you go to Hell, &s;eeing God would have you go to Heaven?

<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, The more it is in direct oppo&s;ition to God in his Commands, or the like, we may be the more &s;ure it is of Satan's framing; for the heart, and its lu&s;ts, &s;eek for &s;atisfaction, &amp; then are &s;till, (if Satan joi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> not) tho' God be not &s;o directly oppo&s;ite: But the Devil &s;trikes always at God in his temptations; or if not always, yet mo&s;t frequently.</P>
<P>Thus much for the Tempter; now for the Temptation it &s;elf There are &s;everal &s;orts of temptations; but to reduce them all to the&s;e three Heads, they do concern, and &s;trike at. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of all, God; this being Satans great aim, to oppo&s;e God; as two enemies, always in di|rect oppo&s;ition to one another; and thus he tempts either: 1. As to the Being of God, call|ing in que&s;tion the very truth of the E&s;&s;ence of the great God, cau&s;ing the &s;oul to doubt whe|ther there be a God or no, like <HI>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord,</HI> &amp;c <HI>Exod.</HI> 1.5.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> Some Temptations touch upon the nature of God, as to the manner of his Be|ing, the My&s;tery of three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons, as to their Offices &amp; Operations, in the individual God-head, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit; and yet all but one God ble&s;|&s;ed for ever.

I &s;ay, &s;ometimes as doubting of the&s;e things is our temptation; yea, &amp; could Satan prevail, we &s;hould flatly deny his Being, Nature, Pro|perties &amp; all.

And, if I mi&s;take not, a great device of Satan's in this &s;tratagem, is, to per&s;wade the Creature from all dependency up|on a Creator, that &s;o being left to her &s;elf, and &s;tanding upon its own &s;trength, he may more de&s;troy it. For what's the Creature without the Creator's power?</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome Temptations touch our Spiritu|al Being. Such as are an evil heart of unbelief, mi&s;tru&s;ting the grace of God, de&s;pairing of the goodne&s;s of our Condition. Satan would fain raze the very Fountain of Spiritual Exi&s;tence, Adoption, Ju&s;tification, &amp; hopes of Salvation; it is his great de&s;ign to &s;hake the very ground|work of this Building, &amp; to per&s;wade, that all's fal&s;e.

<P N="3">3. La&s;tly, Satan by his fiery Darts &s;trikes at our well-being to di&s;turb our Peace by the o|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>Duty,</HI> or <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Sin;</HI> when he finds he cannot prevail to de&s;troy out <HI>being,</HI> then he would deprive us of <HI>well-being,</HI> our <HI>joy</HI> &amp; <HI>comfort.</HI> But know, tho' the&s;e Temp|tations may trouble us, yet &s;hall they never de|&s;troy us. Now for the manner of the&s;e Temp|tations, how they work.</P>
<P N="1">1. When we fall under any want, &s;trait, change of Providence, or the like; then is a time for temptation to work; as when Chri&s;t had fa&s;ted &amp; was an hungred, then comes the
<PB N="333" REF="001244_0170_0FB1865B5E27BDE8">Tempter, <HI>If thou be the Son of God, command that the&s;e &s;tones may be made bread,</HI> Mat. 4.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. When we are fir&s;t turning from &s;in to God, then we are &s;ure to meet with a <HI>Tempter,</HI> Satan will be bu&s;ie.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we are troubled, dejected, di&s;con|&s;olated, either to the outward or inward e&s;tate, then beware of Satan's temptation, he will be furthering our di&s;quietments.</P>
<P N="4">4. When we are arrived to &s;ome good hopes, thro' Grace, to &s;ome Confidence in the Mercy of God the Father, thro' his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; then al&s;o &s;hall we find the battering A&s;&s;aults of Satan to &s;hake our Confidence: but be &s;ure al|ways, that the grounds of your Confidence be good, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon that Everla&s;ting Rock, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For, if I mi&s;take not in my ob&s;er|vation, there are two great Rocks, which Satan &s;trives to &s;plit a Soul upon, <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> and <HI>De|&s;pair:</HI> Sometimes endeavouring to cau&s;e Souls to flatter up them&s;elves, &amp; think Grace is theirs, Chri&s;t is theirs, and all is theirs, when it is no|thing &s;o, but by this he might carry them blind to Hell, hood-winking their Souls &s;o, that they never come to &s;ee throughly, that they are in a bad condition, but think always their condi|tion good. The other Rock is <HI>De&s;pair;</HI> Satan &s;triving, if he cannot blind them, as he doth the other pre&s;umptuous Souls, yet to make them go &s;orrowing all their days, thinking they &s;hall never obtain that Mercy which o|thers think they always had.</P>
<P N="5">5. Satan &s;uits his Temptations to our Di&s;po|&s;itions; he hath various Objects for divers Spi|rits; for the proud haughty Soul, for the lu&s;tful
<PB N="334" REF="001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0">Heart, for the covetous Worldling, for the Prodigal Son, for the ra&s;h giddy Brain, for the &s;luggi&s;h Drone, for the melancholly Per&s;on, for the light chearful Spirit; e&s;pecially the&s;e two, either &s;inking the one in the terrible Waves of black and dreadful Thoughts, or to&s;&s;ing and li&s;ting up the other with the Wind of fooli&s;h Fancy. Oh! what black Apprehen&s;ions &s;hall the one have of it &s;elf &amp; God? and what light and &s;light Thoughts the other, of the pre&s;ent State, and of Eternity.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Satan aims to lull the Soul a&s;leep in carnal &s;ecurity: And to this end, pre&s;ents great &s;ins as &s;mall, &amp; little &s;ins, (if any there be) as none at all: But &s;ometimes he will add by temptation, as it were a multiplying-gla&s;s, to the &s;oul, &s;o that then every &s;in looks with a gha&s;tly countenance, is thought to be the &s;in a|gain&s;t the Holy Spirit, an unpardonable Sin.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn how, and upon what oc|ca&s;ion Satan works; I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to en|quire, why they have &s;o much power, as many times to prevail.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e of the Tempters Power, he is per|haps too &s;trong for the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e of the Tempters Policy; if he can|not prevail by open force, the &s;oul being well &amp; &s;trongly grounded; then he invades by &s;ub|til devices, &amp; &s;ecret &s;tratagems, &s;o that the &s;oul cannot e&s;cape by &s;trength only; and therefore (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wanting wi&s;dom to evade his cunningly fra|med Arguments) is baffled by him, &amp; overthrown.</P>
<P N="3">3. The enticing Nature of the Tempter's Baits; As, to in&s;tance in one ca&s;e, Oh how ma|ny poor &s;incere &s;ouls, yet guilty of too much
<PB N="335" REF="001244_0171_0FB1865C2E938DB0">curio&s;ity, have been intangled by curiou&s;ly glorious, &amp; gloriou&s;ly curious Tenets, which were no better than the devili&s;h temptation of that Helli&s;h Tempter! How many, (which yet is &s;trange to think, tho' there is no rea&s;on to fear it) nay, after their &s;eemingly comfortable, really, comfortle&s;s, wandring walkings in thought-ways of truth, have cau&s;e to fit down, &amp; &s;et down their &s;teps, marking for every &s;tep a &s;in; &amp; for every &s;in, letting fall a tear of blood.</P>
<P N="4">4. Temptations often prevail by rea&s;on of the &s;trength of Corruptions, which the Temp|ter works upon. Were there no Corruptions, there would be few or no Temptations; I am &s;ure, they &s;hould not prevail.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, The Tempter's prevalency pro|ceeds from the weakne&s;s and low e&s;tate of the inward man: Sin is never at a higher flood, than when Grace is at a low ebb: It is a hard matter (believe Experience) to keep the Soul from &s;inking at &s;uch a time. Nothing more ea|&s;ie than to thru&s;t one under water, when the depth of the water is more than the heighth of the man.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But now to make &s;ure the Doctrinal part, I &s;hall lay down &s;ome Rea&s;ons, why the People of God are thus attended with Temptations: for it is a na|tural Objection again&s;t this Point, Why will the Lord, who is &s;o mere. ful of his People, &s;uffer them to be thus u&s;ed and buffeted by Temptation?</HI></P>

<P>Now I come to the proof of this point: <HI>That the only way to avoid the evil of Temptation, as to, watch &amp; pray.</HI> This is clearly &s;tated in the Text; &s;o that it &s;carce needs more confirmation; only take that of <HI>Paul,</HI> when buffetted by Temptation: <HI>For this,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>I be&s;ought the Lord thrice,</HI> 2.

<PB N="343" REF="001244_0175_0FB18662E30F43F8">12.8 There is great need of <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Praying:</HI> 1. Before we fall into Temptation. 2. When we are under Temptation. How <HI>Watching</HI> &amp; <HI>Pray|ing</HI> conduceth to the anticipating the A&s;&s;aults of <HI>Satan,</HI> fru&s;trating Temptation. Fir&s;t of all, for <HI>Watching.</HI>

<ITEM>3. It is a countermine to all <HI>Satan's</HI> &s;tratagems: It will deceive the Deceiver, to find us watching with &s;piritual diligence, when he would have us &s;leeping in carnal &s;ecu|rity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Watching &s;ecures us from much evil that might be added, in ca&s;e we were drawn to the Temptation: for &s;ecurity is no better than a temptation, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time. Secondly, for <HI>Prayer:</HI> This conduceth to avoid the evil of Temptation, becau&s;e it fetcheth help from God, in whom is all our &s;trength: for it is Gods pro|mi&s;e, <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, &amp; thou &s;halt glorifie me,</HI> P&s;al. 50 15. It is a great comfort, under temptation, to have a God to go to, e&s;pecially one that is able &amp; willing to help.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This may in&s;truct us. 1. Then there is great need of watching. It is certainly a univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ary duty for all Saints, at whatever time, to watch: So &s;aith <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> our Saviour, <HI>What I &s;ay un|to you, I &s;ay unto all, Watch,</HI> Mar. 13.27. The great end of this duty, is the coming of the <HI>Lord Je&s;us. Watch,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>for you know not what hour your Lord doth come,</HI> Mat. 24.42, 44. There are three Con|&s;iderations may move us to watch. 1. Let us con|&s;ider whom we offend &amp; di&s;honour by our neg|lect in watching, no le&s;s than God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would we

Let as &s;eriou&s;ly weigh how great an offence, how great a di&s;honour to God, our unwatchfulne&s;s is; and this will engage us to watch. 2. Let us con|&s;ider whom we gratifie &amp; advantage by our neg|lect; no le&s;s an enemy than Satan, the enemy of our Souls: And &s;hall we plea&s;ure our grand Ad|ver&s;ary?
