<P>Dearly beloved, I be&s;eech you &mdash; ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts which war again&s;t the Soul.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Words now read, are a general Exhortation, the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> gives to tho&s;e, to whom he di|rects this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> and it is made to them in the utmo&s;t compa&s;|&s;ion and tenderne&s;s, with the greate&s;t humility &amp; meekne&s;s&punc; <HI>Dearly beloved, I be&s;eech you,</HI> &amp;c. He does it that the exhortation might the more agreably &s;lide into, and be the more likely to fix on the
<PB N="2" REF="003408_0004_10034DE5C610D758">
Mind. This may be the grand de&s;ign of this tenderne&s;s, and of his friendly Language: A good Example to be followed by the Go&s;pel <HI>Mini&s;ter.</HI> And having laid &s;o good a founda|tion by his &s;oft and tender addre&s;s, for the en|tertainment of his Exhortation, he proceeds di|rectly to the Matter of it; and that is the mo&s;t weighty and important. He per&s;wades them to <HI>ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts.</HI> By fle&s;hly lu&s;ts I would under&s;tand in general, all <HI>inordinate cravings</HI> and de&s;ires of the Soul after <HI>&s;en&s;ual Objects,</HI> after the gro&s;s enjoyments of the pre|&s;ent Life &amp; World. This is the light &amp; view I purpo&s;e to con&s;ider the&s;e <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> in, and no doubt is the true meaning of them in the <HI>Text.</HI> I know they are frequently el&s;ewhere taken in a different &amp; more re&s;trained &s;en&s;e. Sometimes they intend &s;ome particular <HI>gro&s;s acts</HI> of Vice which flow from Lu&s;t in the Heart, as the Streams do from the Fountain; and &s;o tho&s;e Sins menti|oned <HI>Chap.</HI> 4. <HI>v.</HI> 4. of this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI> are called the <HI>Lu&s;ts of the Gentiles.</HI> Sometimes they intend the general Corruption of the Nature; &s;ome|times the de&s;ires after, and the gro&s;s <HI>acts of Un|cleane&s;s.</HI> But I would take them here in the <HI>large&s;t &s;en&s;e,</HI> to mean all <HI>worldly Lu&s;ts,</HI> the &s;ame with that, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.12. And as all the&s;e in particular, &s;o all other kinds in general of the&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts are to be avoided, and ab&s;tained from, and not to be indulged. And this weigh|ty advice, the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> backs and enforces with
<PB N="3" REF="003408_0005_10034DE8E7568E80">
<HI>two</HI> of the mo&s;t important <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> in the World, with two of the mo&s;t moving Argu|ments; the <HI>one</HI> is drawn from our un&s;etled State and Condition in the pre&s;ent World. As <HI>Pil|grims and Strangers.</HI> We all know with what carele&s;ne&s;s and indifference <HI>Travellers</HI> abroad in the World are wont to treat the Objects they meet with: The&s;e they are not wont to be much affected with, looking upon them&s;elves as ab&s;ent from and quickly to return home. And &s;uch &s;hould our carriage be towards the enjoyments of the pre&s;ent World, we &s;hould carry it with the like coldne&s;s and in|difference towards them. The <HI>other Argu|ment</HI> is taken from the great danger of indulg|ing the&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, and the <HI>great wrong and injury they will mo&s;t certainly do the Soul:</HI> they <HI>war again&s;t it,</HI> and if indulged, will be likely to gain the victory and conque&s;t over it, and finally will ruin &amp; de&s;troy it. And altho' both the&s;e Arguments are very weighty and forceable to per&s;wade Men to ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts; it is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of them only, even as they will be exceeding hurtful and <HI>injurious to the Soul,</HI> that I purpo&s;e in the <HI>pre&s;ent Di&s;|cour&s;e</HI> to confine my &s;elf to; tho' the other may have &s;ome place in the Di&s;cour&s;e. And the general <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> I &s;hall make as the ground and foundation of the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be this <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003408_0006_10034CF72EEFBF40"><HI>OBSER.</HI> That we &s;hould ab&s;tain from the inordinate indulgence of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, as they are very hurtful and injurious to the Soul.</P>
<P>I &s;ay &s;inful or inordinate Indulgence of <HI>fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts,</HI> becau&s;e taking of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts in <HI>one &s;en&s;e,</HI> the indulgence of them is lawful, and &s;o cannot be hurtful or injurious to the Soul. Man in his two Con&s;tituent parts is <HI>Body</HI> &amp; <HI>Soul.</HI> And there are the Lu&s;ts or de&s;ires of the Body after the&s;e and tho&s;e <HI>&s;en&s;ible Objects,</HI> after tho&s;e things that are nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport and comfort of it. And the&s;e de&s;ires are im|planted on purpo&s;e to move Mankind to pur|&s;ue tho&s;e things that are in &s;uch re&s;pects nece&s;|&s;ary for the Body, to render it ea&s;y and happy. And it would mo&s;t certainly carry in it a gro&s;s reflection upon the great <HI>Creator</HI> and wi&s;e Au|thor of our Being, to &s;uppo&s;e that He had made us with the&s;e de&s;ires, and all in vain; yea, and when it mu&s;t needs be a Crime in us to &s;eek af|ter the gratification, or the &s;atisfaction of them. But it is &s;o far from this, that GOD Him&s;elf is plea&s;ed to propound the&s;e &s;en&s;ible things to us as &s;o many motives or arguments, to per&s;wade us to the practice of Religion. How often is He plea&s;ed to make the promi&s;es of <HI>Temporal Rewards</HI> to Mankind, to encourage them to Obedience. The arguments like that, in <HI>Job</HI> 36.11.
<PB N="5" REF="003408_0007_10034DEADCAD79F8">
are frequent, <HI>if they obey and &s;erve him, They &s;hall &s;pend their Days in pro&s;perity, and their Years in plea&s;ures.</HI> Now, can it be tho't rea|&s;onable, that GOD &s;hould thus propound the&s;e things to us, as arguments to Obedience; when at the &s;ame time it would be unlawful for us to love &amp; e&s;teem them in &s;ome degree &amp; mea&s;ure; and in the &s;ame proportion to look upon our &s;elves favoured, and &s;o far happy, when we are arrived at the enjoyment of them. There are then the&s;e <HI>De&s;ires</HI> that may be termed <HI>Fle&s;h|ly,</HI> &s;uch as are to the&s;e &amp; tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible Objects, that are adapted to the &s;upport &amp; comfort of the Body, and without which Mankind could not po&s;&s;ibly Sub&s;i&s;t, much le&s;s be happy, that are lawful; and when the&s;e de&s;ires are confined within their <HI>proper bounds</HI> &amp; limits, extend no further than the Nature and the Nece&s;&s;ity of them do in rea&s;on allow, tho' they are &s;till <HI>Fle&s;h|ly,</HI> they are not injurious to the Soul; not hurt|ful but &s;ub&s;ervient to the vigour of it, and the exerci&s;e of its Powers in this imbodied State, wherein the Soul &amp; the Body bear &s;o intimate a relation to one another. It is then the <HI>inor|dinate indulgence</HI> of the&s;e <HI>De&s;ires,</HI> that now falls under Con&s;ideration, and is &s;o injurious to the Soul: And how hurtful and injurious they are in <HI>all re&s;pects</HI> to the Soul, is exceeding hard to declare. There is no one re&s;pect that can be tho't on, wherein the&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts inordinate|ly indulged, are not <HI>warring again&s;t the Soul.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003408_0008_10034DEF529FA788">
I would mention a <HI>few</HI> of the mo&s;t obvious, important and comprehen&s;ive In&s;tances wherein they are <HI>injurious to the Soul;</HI> which is all that can be allowed me, in the limits of a &s;hort Di&s;|cour&s;e: which will abundantly di&s;cover to us of how great weight the Argument is, to per|&s;wade us to <HI>ab&s;tain from them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The inordinate indulgence of the&s;e Lu&s;ts, is <HI>Degrading and Deba&s;ing to the Soul;</HI> and in this re&s;pect injurious to it. As the two Con|&s;tituant parts of Man are <HI>Body and Soul,</HI> and make the humane Compound, &s;o the Soul is by far our mo&s;t <HI>&s;uperiour Part,</HI> and from this we are principally &amp; chiefly to draw our Character. This Soul is truly and &s;trictly Heaven-born: is the immediate <HI>Offspring of GOD;</HI> without &s;o much as the Agency and In&s;trumentality of any &s;econd Cau&s;es at all; and on this account claims kindred with the <HI>Supreme</HI> of the works of GOD, with the <HI>Angels,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Morning Stars,</HI> tho&s;e bright Intelligences. By this we &s;tand nearly related to the World above. While the other part of us, the Body was <HI>formed out of the Du&s;t,</HI> made of the &s;ame vile Materials, that the inferiour Creation was made of; and on the ac|count of this, we very much re&s;emble and &s;tand nearly related to the World below: and while this Body is thus gro&s;s and earthy, the Soul is Spiritual and Immortal, endowed with the exal|ted Powers of <HI>Under&s;tanding, Willing,</HI> Chu&s;ing, Refu&s;ing, and the like: is capable of more ra|tional,
<PB N="7" REF="003408_0009_10034DF0D760B208" MS="y">
manly and &s;uperiour Plea&s;ures, than what can po&s;&s;ibly flow from the gratification of the &s;en&s;es, from any bodily &s;atisfactions. And mu&s;t it not then be a great di&s;honour to the Soul, an Eclip&s;ing of the Glory and Dignity of it, to make it a Servant, a Slave to the <HI>Body?</HI> That while it is &s;o excellent and &s;uperiour in it &s;elf, capable of a far greater happine&s;s than can po&s;|&s;ibly flow from the indulgence of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, the Soul &s;hould be made to lie groveling <HI>in the Du&s;t,</HI> and conver&s;e with nothing but Fle&s;h and Sen&s;e. It is mo&s;t certainly a horrid Degradation to the Soul, and it brings Mankind upon a level with <HI>the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI> Upon the account of this Soul it is that we (e&s;pecially) excel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> World; and if we en&s;lave this to our <HI>Lu&s;ts,</HI> where is the mighty difference between the Man and the Bruit? A <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> happine&s;s, is the highe&s;t they both aim at, and that both are pur&s;uing after. Where then is the difference? To make the Soul thus to truckle to the Body, and to bring it down to &s;erve only the mean purpo&s;es of it, and to conver&s;e with nothing but Fle&s;h &amp; Sen&s;e, while it is capable of, and &s;hould be employed in the <HI>&s;ervice of GOD,</HI> and be <HI>conver&s;ing with things Heavenly &amp; Divine,</HI> mo&s;t certainly is a &s;hame to us; a horrid &s;tain to our Nature; the greate&s;t di&s;honour to us: and &s;o far the de&s;toying of our Character, is injurious to us.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="003408_0010_10034CF8B6C4D408">2. The indulgence of the&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, tend <HI>greatly to darken &amp; ob&s;cure the Under&s;tand|ing of the Soul,</HI> and in this regard is very hurt|ful and injurious. There is nothing that tends more directly to render the Soul cloudy &amp; dark, than the &s;teams of &s;en&s;ual Lu&s;ts: as the&s;e tend directly to quench the Motions of the <HI>Holy SPIRIT,</HI> &s;o they do to put out the Light of Under&s;tanding in the Soul. The &s;ubduing and mortifying the&s;e &s;en&s;ual Lu&s;ts, has a ten|dency to improve and brighten the Under&s;tand|ing; and upon this account the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> tells us, P&s;al. 19.7, 8. <HI>The Te&s;timony of the Lord is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple, the Command|ment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the Eyes. And a good Under&s;tanding have all they what keep his Commandments.</HI> And on this account he was wi&s;er &amp; excelled his <HI>Teachers;</HI> while the in|dulging the&s;e &amp; tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual Lu&s;ts tends directly to render the Soul, unactive, dull &amp; &s;otti&s;h. How does <HI>Intemperance, Uncha&s;tity</HI> and the like fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, not only exhau&s;t &amp; drink up the very Spirits of the Man that indulges him&s;elf in the Practice of them, but al&s;o ca&s;t a Mi&s;t and a Cloud over his Under&s;tanding, and render him in&s;en&s;ible, and keep him in a con&s;tant Doze, as tho'tle&s;s and inadvertent as the very <HI>Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI> We &s;ee this in many a Sen&s;uali&s;t; not only that his Body becomes a walking Ho&s;pital, full of all kinds of loath&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es, but his Soul full of <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion;</HI> and the
<PB N="9" REF="003408_0011_10034DF5440B00F0">
Light of Under&s;tanding by GOD light up in the Soul, almo&s;t totally ob&s;cured and put out. And is not this a great Injury to the Soul, to have any Mi&s;ts and Clouds hang upon the Un|der&s;tanding, upon which we ab&s;olutely depend to direct our way for us, and in all ca&s;es to make it plain before us? We are un&s;peakably Unhap|py (yea it is one of our greate&s;t Mi&s;eries) on the account of that Darkne&s;s that has wrapped up the Under&s;tanding by our fir&s;t parents Fall; and yet every &s;inful Lu&s;t indulged tends to ren|der that Darkne&s;s thicker and more total &s;till; &s;o injurious is it to the Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. The indulgence of the&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts is <HI>De&s;tructive of the Peace &amp; Quietne&s;s of the Soul.</HI> The happine&s;s of Man on Earth con&s;i&s;ts in the quietne&s;s and ea&s;ine&s;s of his Mind; and the only way to attain and enjoy this happine&s;s is to mortify our Lu&s;ts and Corruptions, and to be &s;teady in the Practice of <HI>Religion;</HI> and the indulging &s;inful Lu&s;ts tends directly to ren|der the Soul <HI>re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y</HI> both while Men live, and very commonly when they come to die.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Peace of the Soul is de&s;troyed</HI> by the indulgence of &s;inful Lu&s;ts <HI>for the pre&s;ent, even while the Man Lives.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible but Vice &s;hould make the Soul unea&s;y; for Sin is the Sickne&s;s and Di&s;temper of it; and the Soul can no more be ea&s;y &amp; calm, while it is infe&s;ted with it, than the Body can be ea&s;y, with a di&s;|located
<PB N="10" REF="003408_0012_10034DF8A6ACE100">
Bone or a raging Fever. If the Sen&s;uali&s;t has not &s;tupified &amp; &s;inned away his Con&s;cience, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that he &s;hould be always unea&s;y and di&s;contented, and his Soul like the <HI>troubled Sea.</HI> What can the lively apprehen&s;ions of the Wrath of GOD produce in the Soul, but up|roar and confu&s;ion! And this is every where repre&s;ented to be the true State of a Sinner, that he enjoys no true Peace. He may &s;eem out|wardly Ea&s;y and Merry; but alas! it is only from the Teeth outward: Could we but retire into the Brea&s;t of &s;uch a Man, we &s;hould find a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;orrow. The Ob|&s;ervation of the wi&s;e Man concerning them is, <HI>That in the mid&s;t of laughter their Heart is &s;orrowful, and the end of their Mirth is hea|vine&s;s.</HI> And the Prophet in the mo&s;t lively manner repre&s;ents their re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, by the Sea when ruffled by a Storm or Tempe&s;t, who&s;e Waters <HI>cannot re&s;t,</HI> but are continually <HI>ca&s;ting up Mire &amp; Dirt.</HI> There is <HI>no Peace &s;aith my God to the Wicked,</HI> I&s;a. 57.21. The Foun|dation of pre&s;ent Peace mu&s;t be laid in Holine&s;s. <HI>Great Peace have they</HI> (&s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t) <HI>that love thy Law, and nothing &s;hall offend them.</HI> The <HI>work of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be Peace, and the effect of Righteou&s;ne&s;s Quietne&s;s and A&s;&s;urance forever.</HI> Religion tends to allay tho&s;e guilty Fears that commonly ari&s;e in the Sinner's Soul, and to create that Peace &amp; Joy, that the Sinner never intermeddles with, and
<PB N="11" REF="003408_0013_10034E01D8078510">
mu&s;t forever be a &s;tranger to, let him be in what Place, in what Employment, in what Company &s;oever. This is generally the Sinner's Ca&s;e; except by the repeated Acts of Vice, and the fre|quent indulgence of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, his Con&s;ci|ence is grown callous &amp; &s;tupid; which is a Con|dition next to de&s;perate; for while he that is awake and in danger, is like to u&s;e Means for his &s;afety, he that is a&s;leep peri&s;hes without Tho't or Care. And as the indulgence of the&s;e tends to de&s;troy the Peace of the Soul, while the Man Lives; &s;o,</P>
<P N="2">2. They <HI>have the &s;ame tendency</HI> when <HI>Men come to Die.</HI> And truly, however Men for the pre&s;ent may amu&s;e and &s;tifle their guilty Fears, <HI>then</HI> they will be boi&s;terous and break forth; and if they are not prevented by the vi|olence and &s;tupefaction of the bodily Di&s;ea&s;e, they will then fill the Soul with uproar and confu&s;ion. And indeed what can be the con&s;e|quence of a &s;en&s;ual Life, but this unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content? If the Man that has led &s;uch a Life when he comes to Die be awake there is nothing mo&s;t certainly in that gloomy Hour, that can po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;olid Foundation of Peace and Comfort to him, let him ca&s;t his Tho'ts which way he will. Suppo&s;e he then runs back in his Tho'ts upon the pa&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages of his Life, he finds them all fill'd up in the gratification of his Lu&s;ts; finds his whole Life to have been &s;pent in pampering the Body, and in &s;erving
<PB N="12" REF="003408_0014_10034E0F16732970">
the Intere&s;ts and the De&s;ires of it. And all the while his Soul has been never once tho't on to any purpo&s;e, but left &s;tarving and dying; no|thing done for the Safety and Happine&s;s of it. Can there be any ground of Peace in this, thus to run back in his Tho'ts for Years pa&s;t, be it <HI>Twenty, Thirty,</HI> or <HI>Forty</HI> Years together, and find not one Action that he can re&s;t &s;atisfied in? none but mu&s;t needs admini&s;ter unea&s;ine&s;s &amp; terror to him. And if he looks <HI>inward,</HI> turns in upon the Tho'ts of his Soul, will the pro&s;pect be more comfortable than to reflect upon the Actions of his Life pa&s;t? Verily No! There he finds the <HI>imaginations of the tho'ts</HI> of his Soul to have been <HI>evil only evil and that continually.</HI> There he finds all the Powers of his Soul di&s;ordered and defiled by tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual Lu&s;ts, that his whole Life has been &s;pent in the gratification of. He finds his Under&s;tanding de&s;titude of the Knowledge of things Spiritual &amp; Divine; &s;uch gro&s;s Ig|norance that the things of the Spirit of GOD are counted fooli&s;hne&s;s; the <HI>Will</HI> fixed on &s;en&s;ual Objects, chu&s;ing them, and full of enmity again&s;t GOD, and refu&s;ing any &s;ubjection to Him and His Law. And from a lively &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things, there we &s;hall find <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> rouzing like an angry Lion, and arraigning &amp; condemning the Sinner for all his &s;inful Indulgences and worldly Lu&s;ts, that his Memory in a fre&s;h and very lively manner brings now before him, and &s;ets in the light of His Countenance, as they
<PB N="13" REF="003408_0015_10034E181114AE40">
have always been in the light of GOD's. And can there be any Ea&s;e of Comfort in this pro&s;|pect? No verily, nothing but di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h! And &s;uppo&s;e he ca&s;ts his Eyes around him, there he beholds no ground of Com|fort or Relief neither. He beholds, it may be, his old <HI>Companions</HI> in Sin and Wickedne&s;s, tho&s;e that have tempted <HI>him,</HI> and tho&s;e that <HI>he</HI> has tempted into the&s;e and tho&s;e Vices! But all the&s;e are only &s;o many Remembrancers of his Sin and Guilt unto him, and &s;o many additions to his pre&s;ent Mi&s;ery and Torment. And he may behold others al&s;o, that may drop a Tear to behold his Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h, and in ten|der Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion will pour out a Prayer for his poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul: and that is all they can do; for when they would gradly &s;peak Peace to him, they dare not in faithfulne&s;s to GOD and his Soul; they &s;ee no &s;olid Foundation for it.

And therefore tho' he would now gladly be looking up to GOD, who before has been in none of his tho'ts, he dare not: he is now afraid to look unto Him, whom he has &s;o often and &s;o greatly affront'd; and yet he dare not ca&s;t an eye any other way,

every pro&s;pect is &s;o full of horror. He &s;ees no|thing before him but Legions of Devils, waiting for, &s;tanding ready to catch, and greedily to &s;eize on his guilty Soul, and to drag it away with them, to their uncomfortable abodes; to be its unhappy convoy to the Place of Torments, even to Hell, which he beholds gaping to receive it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>There is a</HI> po&s;&s;ibility, <HI>and if you engage in the Warfare</HI> while in Youth, <HI>a</HI> probability <HI>of obtaining the Victory and the Conque&s;t.</HI> Now you have a greater and more hopeful Pro&s;pect of it, than you will have hereafter. Indeed it is a Warfare that mu&s;t be maintained, and will continue as long as we remain in the Body. We mu&s;t wage a con&s;tant War with the&s;e Lu&s;ts: we mu&s;t be always mortifying and &s;ubduing of them; but the greate&s;t &s;truggle &amp; conflict is <HI>at fir&s;t:</HI> Then is the oppo&s;ition greater, and the conque&s;t the more difficult to obtain. The after conflicts will be more ea&s;y. And multitudes by the help of the <HI>SPIRIT of CHRIST,</HI> have conquered them; and by the help of the &s;ame SPIRIT are going on <HI>conquering &amp; to conquer.</HI> And the &s;ame SPIRIT and Grace are ready al|&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t your &s;incere Endeavours: Yea, if you now early engage in this Warfare, you of all others, have the mo&s;t hopeful pro&s;pect of the Victory.

<P>I have now a few general &amp; plain <HI>Directions</HI> to leave with you; and I have done.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Beg of GOD to give you a ju&s;t notion of the World, a right view of it's Enjoyments.</HI> The wrong apprehen&s;ions and the fal&s;e notions that Mankind entertain of the pre&s;ent World and it's Enjoyments, is one of their greate&s;t Mi|&s;eries here on Earth: for from mi&s;taken appre|hen&s;ions of the&s;e things; from looking upon the&s;e things as mo&s;t excellent, ea&s;ily and very naturally follows the mi&s;take of exerci&s;ing our greate&s;t Care about them. And none are more prone than Per&s;ons in <HI>Youth</HI> to entertain an <HI>unju&s;t Thought</HI> of the&s;e things. They look gay and tempting to them, and commonly make a fair &s;how of <HI>Happine&s;s;</HI> and they above all others, are in the utmo&s;t danger of pur&s;uing them under that notion. They cannot &s;ee that the <HI>Riches</HI> of this World are <HI>uncertain,</HI> that the <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI> are all <HI>&s;hort-liv'd, fla&s;hy &amp; un|&s;atisfactory;</HI> and that worldly <HI>Honours</HI> are more <HI>empty</HI> than either of them: They cannot be per&s;waded, but that Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the Enjoyment of the&s;e. They &s;ee not the&s;e things in their true <HI>Colours;</HI> they view them in a fal&s;e Light, and no wonder they make a fal&s;e Judg|ment
<PB N="22" REF="003408_0024_10034E78390CE390">
of them. And as thro' the darkne&s;s and blindne&s;s of their Minds, they do not &s;ee thro' the deceit of the&s;e things; &s;o they may be im|po&s;ed more ea&s;ily upon, having not met with &s;o many <HI>Di&s;appointments</HI> in their Expectations from them, and in their pur&s;uits after them. And therefore, one of the fir&s;t things you &s;hould beg for and labour after, is, that you may have a <HI>true &s;ight of the Vanity of the World,</HI> and of the in&s;ufficiency of all it's Enjoyments to make you &s;ub&s;tantially Happy, that you may not be impo&s;ed upon and cheated by the &s;eeming and tran&s;itory Glory of the&s;e things. In this lies your greate&s;t hazard as you fir&s;t appear in the World and on the Stage of Action. And here then &s;hould be your greate&s;t Guard. Un|til your Tho'ts are corrected, and your Views &s;et right about the pre&s;ent World, it is not po&s;&s;i|ble that any Con&s;iderations &s;hould prevail upon you, to di&s;&s;wade you from indulging &s;en&s;ual Lu&s;ts; from pur&s;uing the Riches, Honours and Plea&s;ures of this World to make you Happy. As the Foundation of all then, Cry to GOD, as you are &s;etting forth into the World, That He would open your Eyes, and effectually con|vince you, that Happine&s;s lies not below the Skies, and that He would <HI>turn away your Eyes from beholding Vanity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Seek earne&s;tly for the Divine SPIRIT to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the conquering &amp; &s;ub|duing your fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts.</HI> Tho' it be upon all

accounts rea&s;onable in you now to wage open War with the&s;e Lu&s;ts, yet engage not in it tru&s;ting and depending on your &s;elves. You are not &s;trong enough, nor &s;ufficient to conquer and overcome the lea&s;t Corruption, that your &s;en&s;ual part calls upon you to gratify &amp; indulge, entirely of your &s;elves; but will fall down an ea&s;y Conque&s;t before the lea&s;t A&s;&s;ault. You ab&s;olutely need the SPIRIT &amp; Grace of CHRIST to aid &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;t you; and the&s;e you have the &s;tronge&s;t ground to &s;eek for, from that encou|ragement or Promi&s;e our <HI>Saviour</HI> gives to move you to plead for them, Mat. 7.7. <HI>Ask, and ye &s;hall receive; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find, knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you.</HI> And in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> words, He there tells you, that He is more willing to <HI>give His HOLY SPIRIT</HI> to you, than ever you can find the mo&s;t indulgent of your <HI>earthly Parents</HI> to be&s;tow <HI>the&s;e things</HI> upon you. And will you not then, under a deep &s;en&s;e of the <HI>need you have of the SPIRIT,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t you to mortify your Lu&s;ts &amp; Corrup|tions; and under a &s;en&s;e of our <HI>Saviour's</HI> wil|lingne&s;s to afford Him to you, be per&s;waded to go earne&s;tly to our <HI>Saviour</HI> by Prayer, that you may obtain tho&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances from His SPIRIT that may be &s;ufficient for you? Tho' you cannot of your &s;elves conquer your Lu&s;ts, you can do it by the SPIRIT of GOD: And GOD never de|nied His SPIRIT to tho&s;e that &s;incerely &amp; ear|ne&s;tly cry'd to Him that they might obtain Him.
<PB N="24" REF="003408_0026_10034E949C609A48">
Go then to GOD, and plead His readine&s;s to be&s;tow, and your need to obtain the SPIRIT; and you will be &s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;o gain the vic|tory and conque&s;t over all your Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Watch and Guard again&s;t the fir&s;t Mo|tions and Inclinations of your Soul towards &s;inful Lu&s;ts, and reject them with Abhorrence.</HI> Dally and parley with no <HI>Temptation:</HI> This proves the fall &amp; ruin of multitudes of Man|kind. When they are fir&s;t moved by their own corrupt Hearts, or a&s;&s;aulted with any Tempta|tion from without, to indulge this or the other &s;inful Lu&s;t, they &s;tand &s;till to argue &amp; to rea&s;on the Ca&s;e; and every moment they are debating, the Temptation gains ground upon them, and they in&s;en&s;ibly and &s;uddenly fall by it. There is no trifling in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. To he&s;itate is to be undone. Whenever then you are Tempted, <HI>reject the fir&s;t Motion</HI> that is made, with Ab|horrence, if you would be &s;afe and come off a Conqueror. You all know how dangerous it is to let down the Watch, and to enter into a Par|ley with an Enemy that is waiting for an Op|portunity to &s;urprize us. The Apo&s;tle declares, Jam. 1.15. <HI>Then when Lu&s;t hath conceiv'd, it bringeth forth Sin.</HI> The fir&s;t approaches of Sin are u&s;ually Mode&s;t; but afterwards it maketh bolder Attempts.

the <HI>Thought,</HI> to mortify it in the <HI>Heart,</HI> before it breaks forth in the <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>And then finally,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Be frequent in your Contemplations on the Frailty and Mortality of the Body.</HI> You <HI>of late</HI> in &s;pecial, have had by the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD the <HI>fulle&s;t Convictions</HI> and the plain|e&s;t Demon&s;trations of it that can be. The <HI>re|peated Deaths of late,</HI> and the removal of tho&s;e of the &s;ame Rank, Order and Society with you, are clear Di&s;coveries of <HI>your Frailty</HI> al&s;o, as well as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Mortality that you car|ry about with you in your own Bodies.

Don't &s;tifle them, nor &s;uppre&s;s them: for no|thing is a better Pre&s;ervative, a more effectual Motive to di&s;&s;wade you from indulging fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts. View the Body in the Grave; there behold the State and Condition of it; and then judge, and &s;ay, whether it be worth the while to &s;pend the whole Life in the pre&s;ent World to indulge it, and to gratify the Lu&s;ts of it.</P>
<P>Look upon your &s;elves as <HI>Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth,</HI> and upon your Body as mouldering apace into Du&s;t, and it will mo&s;t certainly tend greatly to the mortification of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts. This is one Argument u&s;ed by
