<P>For all People will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</P></Q>
<P>_IT is my part in this Lecture, according to the cour&s;e appoint|ed by the Honorable Founder, <Q>to prove, explain, or &s;hew the proper u&s;e and improve|ment of the principles of <HI>na|tural Religion,</HI> as it is com|monly called by Divines and Learned Men.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ubject has been again and again managed with great accuracy, by a number of learned and ju|dicious Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who have gone before me in the&s;e anniver&s;ary labors. But if I can add nothing to what they have already delivered, it will not be wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of the in|&s;titution, to bring again into view the main princi|ples on which natural religion is built, and &s;hew how far all mankind are bound by them, what co-inci|dence they have with revealed religion, and in what re&s;pects they tend to confirm Chri&s;tianity, and per|fect that practical obedience which the Go&s;pel re|quires.</P>
<P>The text now read mentions it as a well known fact, confirmed by a general view of the world, that <HI>all people,</HI> all nations and per&s;ons, have &s;ome God or Gods in whom they place their confidence, and to
<PB N="6" REF="014822_0004_0F95B3620B6C3990">whom they pay religious honors: This univer&s;al practice is &s;uppo&s;ed to have it's foundation in the very nature of man as a rational creature, who, by the lea&s;t reflexion on the univer&s;e around him, will be led to entertain general apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome &s;uperior Power or Powers, pre&s;iding over the whole and every part. And from this ob&s;ervation is de|duced a &s;trong argument in favor of that religion which has the one living and true God for it's Object: for the wor&s;hipers of Jehovah have rea&s;on to glory in their re&s;olute adherence to him, and regulate their whole conduct in life by the deepe&s;t reverence of his name, and a con&s;ciencious de&s;ire to honor and obey him, &s;ince <HI>nature</HI> it&s;elf dictates the wor&s;hip of a God, and all mankind feel the obligation, however erro|neous and gro&s;s their notions of a Deity may be. The Prophet introduces God's faithful people, who in the latter days &s;hould enjoy the privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel, as ri&s;ing &s;uperior to all the reproaches ca&s;t upon them for their unremitting zeal in the wor&s;hip of their God and Savior; and ex|pre&s;&s;ing, in one &s;hort &s;entence, their determination to per&s;evere in the religion they had embraced, and the full conviction of their minds that this determi|nation was ju&s;tifiable by the principles of rea&s;on, and the univer&s;al zeal of mankind in the &s;ervice of tho&s;e Deities which they had &s;et up according to their own imaginations, through ignorance of the true God,&mdash; <Q>For all people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</Q></P>
<P>Let us then begin with &s;ome inquiry into the Religion of nature, and con&s;ider what it is; what are the main principles on which it is built; to what perfection it may be, or has been in fact carried; and how far all mankind are held under the obli|gations of it.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of <HI>religion,</HI> we ought to include
<PB N="7" REF="014822_0005_0F95B362FA693770">more in the idea than merely a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of morality,</HI> adapted to the &s;ituation of mankind in the pre&s;ent world, &s;eparate from the con&s;ideration of divine Government, and proper rewards and puni&s;hments. If men had no knowledge at all of the Deity, or no manner of regard to him; if they had neither hopes nor fears beyond the injoyments of the pre&s;ent life in the natural cour&s;e of things, and con&s;ulted only temporal &s;ecurity and comfort, they would find it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve tho&s;e natural laws which regu|late the conduct of rational creatures for their good, both in &s;ocial connexions, and as individuals; but there would be impropriety in calling &s;uch morality by the name of religion, unle&s;s in a much laxer &s;en&s;e than is now commonly affixed to the word: for by religion is meant, not only an obligation on con|&s;cience by a conviction of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and beneficial tendency of morality in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, but that more powerful obligation which binds us, by the love and fear of God, to conform to his will, and labor to be accepted in his &s;ight in all our actions, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that our highe&s;t felicity is derived from his favor.</P>
<P>Religion begins in the acknowledgement of a Deity, and tho&s;e acts of devotion which immediately appear nece&s;&s;ary as &s;oon as God is known. Devotion is maintained by a con&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion of our depen|dence on the Deity for all things. And as he is Lord of all, and mankind are under his moral go|vernment, we become con&s;cious of guilt before him when we act contrary to the dictates of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and enjoy the higher &s;atisfaction in right conduct as we hope to be approved and rewarded by him. Thus every branch or morality is connect|ed with religion, and becomes an important part of it; becau&s;e in regulating our behaviour, we feel the bond of duty to God on our con&s;cience, without which morality might be con&s;idered as a good &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem, but intirely di&s;tinct from religion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014822_0006_0F95B3632EC7DC50">
However; &s;ince the apprehen&s;ions of a Deity, and the obligations of con&s;cience thence arising, are as univer&s;al among mankind as the knowledge of tho&s;e natural laws, which are e&s;&s;ential to good order and comfort in the pre&s;ent world; we may con&s;ider the <HI>religion</HI> and the <HI>law of nature</HI> as the &s;ame thing. For it is as plainly a law of nature, that we &s;hould honor and obey God, and behave in all re&s;pects as creatures dependent on him, and accountable to him, as that we &s;hould be ju&s;t, merciful and kind to our fellow men, and govern our&s;elves by rules of com|mon wi&s;dom and prudence.</P>
<P><HI>The religion of nature,</HI> con&s;idered in the mo&s;t per|fect view, is that which we &s;uppo&s;e inve&s;tigable by the natural powers of the human mind, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any revelation from heaven. If there|fore the que&s;tion is &s;tated in this view, and the in|quiry is,&mdash;What Sy&s;tem of religion <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> alone would trace out when exerci&s;ed on this grand &s;ubject, &mdash;we mu&s;t proceed on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the rati|onal powers are exerci&s;ed in full &s;trength, without the lea&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or wrong bia&s;s, to blind the mind, or pervert the judgment. By &s;uch a perfect exerci&s;e of the rational faculties, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential characters of God might perhaps be learned, from the &s;ignatures of them marked on all parts of the creation. By ju&s;t ob&s;ervations on the grandeur, or|der, and beauty of the univer&s;e; the natures, pur|po&s;es, and powers of the various ranks of Beings, animate and inanimate; together with the many in|dications of the con&s;tant agency of &s;ome &s;upreme Intelligence, in continuing the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things, providing for all po&s;&s;ible changes of circum|&s;tances, and exerci&s;ing a more immediate government over mankind, agreable to their rational faculties and moral &s;tate; we may &s;uppo&s;e the mind would na|turally be led to &s;uch reflexions as the&s;e&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>Surely this &s;tupendous univer&s;e is the work of
<PB N="9" REF="014822_0007_0F95B3640CB65D30">&s;ome invi&s;ible Agent, beyond all compari&s;on and conception &s;uperior to man: for &s;uch a grand complete Sy&s;tem, &s;o infinitely complicate, and yet &s;o exactly adju&s;ted in all it's parts, the mo&s;t mi|nute as well as the grande&s;t, that all kinds of &s;ym|metry and perfection concur to complete the whole, could never be the effect of chance, or the product of endle&s;s e&s;&s;ays and mutations of matter. This Agent mu&s;t have an unlimited mind, to compre|hend the&s;e va&s;t innumerable works in one perfect Idea, before they were made. His <HI>power,</HI> al&s;o, mu&s;t be equal to his unlimited under&s;tanding. And He is evidently as <HI>good</HI> as he is wi&s;e and powerful; otherwi&s;e malignity again&s;t his creatures would appear in univer&s;al di&s;cords through nature, per|petually generating all manner of evils.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>moral characters</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary to ren|der man honorable and amiable, the &s;ame ought to be attributed to the glorious unknown Author of all things in unbounded perfection; e&s;pecially as the government of all worlds, and every crea|ture that exi&s;ts mu&s;t be in his hands. To imagine him capable of committing any error, or having any moral evil imputed to him, would be to de|grade him at once, in theory, from all his honor as God, and judge him di&s;qualified either to be the maker or governor of the univer&s;e. If he is acknowledged as <HI>King and Judge</HI> of all the earth, he mu&s;t be worthy the highe&s;t confidence of man|kind,&mdash;as impartially <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> determined to puni&s;h all wickedne&s;s, according to the demerit of every crime committed by rational creatures again&s;t the law they are under, whatever honorable di&s;tinc|tions they may claim in other re&s;pects, and to &s;hew &s;pecial favor only to the righteous;&mdash;and as per|fectly <HI>benevolent;</HI> making it the grand de&s;ign of his univer&s;al dominion, to &s;ecure to every living creature all the happine&s;s &s;uitable to it's nature,
<PB N="10" REF="014822_0008_0F95B366973C1EC0">and con&s;i&s;tent with the general order of the world, and the moral government of rational beings, and manife&s;ting his tender mercies towards all in cir|cum&s;tances of mi&s;ery. All the good mankind in|joy mu&s;t come from his hands;&mdash;all the evils they fear mu&s;t be under his direction;&mdash;and according to their knowledge of his glorious perfections, they mu&s;t be bound to pay him homage, make their prayer to him, give thanks for his goodne&s;s, love, fear, tru&s;t in him, and obey his Will.</P>
<P>If God is a Being of perfect moral rectitude (certainly he mu&s;t be &s;uch) and if he takes any notice at all of mankind, every immorality practi&s;ed among men mu&s;t be highly offen&s;ive to his nature. <HI>Rea&s;on is his Law</HI> given to man, indelibly imprint|ed on his mind: but to prevent the labor and error of long ab&s;tract rea&s;onings in order to a&s;certain the nece&s;&s;ary duties of life in their various branches and changeable circum&s;tances, He has furni&s;hed man with a kind of in&s;tinctive knowledge, by which he is capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt right and wrong action, almo&s;t as immediately and nece&s;&s;a|rily as the inferior creatures know their proper food, or &s;hun their enemies. <HI>Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience</HI> therefore co-incide in the government of human actions, and to di&s;regard them mu&s;t be a crime in the view of that Deity who gave mankind their rational powers: and He that made us under this law of nature doubtle&s;s will inforce the ob&s;ervance of it by the proper exerci&s;e of his authority, in be&s;towing &s;uitable rewards on the obedient, and puni&s;hing &s;uch as di&s;regard it. Therefore the prac|tice of every thing good and virtuous is to be con|&s;idered as <HI>duty to God,</HI> as well as nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of Society, and the welfare of indivi|duals; it mu&s;t render men amiable to that perfect Being who is above all, to act in the mo&s;t perfect manner of which their nature is capable; and on
<PB N="11" REF="014822_0009_0F95B367821D32E0">the contrary, they mu&s;t appear odious, and be ex|po&s;ed to his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, when every maxim of wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice is counteracted; and from the favor of the great God, the greate&s;t good which can be de&s;ired may be expected; but mi&s;ery and death mu&s;t be the effect of his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P></Q>
<P>In &s;ome &s;uch manner as this <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in it's perfect &s;tate might be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of arriving at the knowledge of the <HI>One true God,</HI> and deducing from thence a compleat &s;y&s;tem of natural religion. Yet it can hardly be conceived, according to our expe|rience of the labor of &s;earching out truth, that the human mind, in its utmo&s;t &s;trength, could by one glance of thought di&s;cover all the e&s;&s;ential characters of the Deity, or the proper acts of wor&s;hip and obe|dience which he requires. We might as well affirm, that unimpaired rea&s;on mu&s;t naturally, at the fir&s;t view of the heavenly bodies, have a clear knowledge of their magnitudes, di&s;tances, and revolutions: or by looking round on the earth, immediately be ac|quainted with the innumerable gradations of animal life, and vegetable productions and Fo&s;&s;ils of all forms and u&s;es. In &s;uch limited Beings as man, there cannot be an in&s;tantaneous knowledge of things, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are &s;ublime and ren ote from &s;en&s;e; the di&s;covery of one truth leads on to another, and by con&s;tant progre&s;s we perfect every theory.</P>
<P>Therefore it may ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned whether, if man at his fir&s;t creation, furni&s;hed with the &s;tronge&s;t mental powers, and continuing innocent and free from every bia&s;s again&s;t the knowledge of God, had been left to him&s;elf intirely, to form his notions of a Deity, merely by his own reflections, without any &s;upernatural revelation, it would not have co&s;t the labor of Ages to demon&s;trate a true Sy&s;tem of reli|gion, as it has really taken near &s;ix thou&s;and years to &s;earch out the laws of the material &s;y&s;tem, and bring natural philo&s;ophy to it's pre&s;ent perfect on.
<PB N="12" REF="014822_0010_0F95B367AF01B100">Indeed it may be doubted whether religion could ever have been delineated, with &s;uch preci&s;ion, and a&s;&s;urance of truth, as now it has been, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of immediate revelation.</P>
<P>No &s;ufficient experiment ever has been made to determine this que&s;tion; there never was a time when mankind were ab&s;olutely le&s;t without revela|tion, though &s;ome nations have approached very near to &s;uch a &s;tate, and have, for wi&s;e ends of providence, to &s;hew the great imbecility of human rea&s;on, been &s;uffered (as the Apo&s;tle &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>to &s;eek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</HI> Notwith|&s;tanding any hypothe&s;is confidently advanced to the contrary, Adam, who came into exi&s;tence in perfect &s;tature of body immediately, and not by &s;low ad|vances, was at once as perfect in his mind, capable of exerci&s;ing all the faculties with which his Creator endowed him in the be&s;t manner; but it does not appear that he was left to find out, merely by the force of rea&s;on, who was the author of his Being. His Maker immediately di&s;covered him&s;elf by an open corre&s;pondence, and &s;ettled the terms of per|petual communion and friend&s;hip; otherwi&s;e the fir&s;t man, &s;tarting &s;uddenly into Being, and filled with amazement at the infinite variety of Objects pre|&s;ented before him in the new world, might long have wondered what power created him, and wearied him|&s;elf in his inquiries concerning the Author of nature, before he could have gained full &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A revelation once made may have in &s;ome degree a perpetual effect. A point of knowlege of the fir&s;t importance, given from above in a &s;upernatural way, would be handed down to po&s;terity with peculiar care. But when revelations are from time to time renewed, and at &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, and in &s;uch methods as are mo&s;t likely to &s;pread the report of them through the world, and continue their remembrance, the knowledge
<PB N="13" REF="014822_0011_0F95B3687796E948">communicated imperceptibly mixes with the natural notions of mankind, &s;o that it is difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the one and the other.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on it is not ea&s;y to determine where any &s;y&s;tem of mere natural religion is to be found; much le&s;s what nations have practi&s;ed on &s;uch a &s;y&s;|tem. As to the moral philo&s;ophy of the moderns, it is far from being the production of &s;imple nature. It has borrowed great light from the la&s;t and cleare&s;t revelation of the grace of God to men, though pride forbids the &s;everal Authors to give credit for what they have received, and they bend all their force to de&s;troy the reputation of tho&s;e &s;acred Oracles of wi&s;|dom, to which they owe every improvement they have made beyond the heathen Sages. Nor can we allow that <HI>Plato, Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Cicero,</HI> collected their theology intirely from nature. The fame of <HI>Jeho|vah,</HI> the God of the Jews, had long been &s;pread abroad in the world by the miracles wrought for his people, the great judgments manife&s;ted in the &s;ight of all nations on their account, and the many won|derful deliverances granted them. By all the&s;e the divine perfections were clearly demon&s;trated; nor were the &s;acred Oracles wholly unknown to the king|doms bordering on Canaan, or the countries where the Jews were di&s;per&s;ed by wars or for the &s;ake of commerce. E&s;pecially after the jewi&s;h &s;criptures were tran&s;lated into the greek language, great num|bers in all parts became acquainted with them, many were pro&s;elyted to the true God, and doubtle&s;s Phi|lo&s;ophers had the curio&s;ity to read them, and did not neglect to make &s;ome advantage of the knowlege they gained for the farther improvement of their own &s;chemes, however they might de&s;pi&s;e the pecu|liarities of the jewi&s;h religion.</P>
<P>The agreement of all nations in acknowleging &s;ome heavenly Powers, &s;hows that rea&s;on naturally admits the notion of a God, as far as he is di&s;cover'd
<PB N="14" REF="014822_0012_0F95B36973CBFAB0">to minds now greatly darkned. Their erroneous conceptions of him originate from the evil di&s;po&s;i|tions of nature corrupted: for the love of &s;inful gra|tifications directly militates again&s;t the love of truth, and that knowlege of God which binds men to a wife, virtuous and pious conduct.</P>
<P>When the world was peopled after the <HI>Flood,</HI> all mankind were acquainted with the one true God, and that rational and &s;piritual wor&s;hip which he requires; but as vice increa&s;ed, they grew more aver&s;e to the purity of religion, though natural rea&s;on would not &s;uffer them ab&s;olutely to renounce the form; and &s;o they gradually lo&s;t what they knew of God, changed his wor&s;hip into gro&s;s &s;uper&s;titions, and &s;tep by &s;tep introduced the mo&s;t abominable idolatries. In Abraham's day Idolatry began generally to obtain; and that heaven might bear public te&s;timony again&s;t it, and prevent it's becoming ab&s;olutely univer&s;al, that Patriarch was called out of his own Country, and his &s;eed &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the nations and &s;ettled in Canaan, which became a cho&s;en Theatre for new di&s;plays of the divine glory in the view of the whole world. Notwith&s;tanding which, Idolatry prevailed; and in&s;tead of being checked and eradi|cated by the refinements of &s;cience, and politene&s;s of manners among the Greeks and Romans, the infa|tuation of their minds was continually increa&s;ing, and &s;uper&s;tition appeared dre&s;&s;ed up in a multitude of additional ornaments; for the <HI>world by</HI> all its <HI>wi&s;dom knew not God.</HI> This well agrees with what St. Paul &s;ays of the &s;tate of the Gentiles in the fir&s;t chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Romans&mdash;<HI>"They are without excu&s;e; becau&s;e that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but be|came vain in their imaginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkned. Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e they be|came fools &amp;c.&mdash;And even as they did not like to re|tain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a
<PB N="15" REF="014822_0013_0F95B36C66ED2A08">reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not conve|nient; being filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s &amp;c."</HI></P>
<P>Did <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> naturally lead mankind into all the&s;e &s;hameful &s;uper&s;titions and vices?&mdash;This would be the mo&s;t reproachful reflexion on Rea&s;on, and give us the mo&s;t contemptible idea of natural religion.&mdash; No &s;urely; but by all this we have full evidence of the weakne&s;s and great corruption of human nature, that rea&s;on no longer maintains its proper empire in the &s;oul, but fle&s;h and &s;en&s;e have u&s;urped an un|controuled authority.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t we can know of natural religion by any experiments among tho&s;e that have, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t that knowlege which was originally communicated to mankind by revelation, is by the writings of their mo&s;t eminent <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> But in the very be&s;t of them we find great errors and defi|ciencies, both in theology and morals. Some of them, indeed, have done wonders, con&s;idering the vulgar prejudices they had to combat, in a&s;&s;erting the unity of the Deity and tracing out his perfections, as well as drawing a &s;y&s;tem of morals: but it was not in their power to avoid &s;ome capital errors in both, while rea&s;on was making efforts again&s;t the univer&s;al corruption; &s;o that we cannot from them gain an idea of the religion of nature altogether ju&s;t.</P>
<P>We are not to expect to find the <HI>religion of nature</HI> exemplified in any &s;y&s;tems of theology or forms of devotion, <HI>generally receiv'd</HI> and ob&s;erved among na|tions unenlightened by revelation, though we abate much from the perfection even of that to which their Philo&s;ophers attained, on account of the unavoidable weakne&s;s of human nature as it now appears. The philo&s;ophic religion of the antient Sages came near|e&s;t to the dictates of mere rea&s;on, however chargea|ble with many deviations and deficiencies; but it never generally obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014822_0014_0F95B36D669EDF10">
But now, after &s;o many di&s;couragements in our endeavours to find the theory of natural religion ve|rified in the practice of mankind, &s;hall we wholly give up the point, and &s;ay &s;uch religion is intirely imaginary?&mdash;By no means:&mdash;Let us look more intimately into human nature, and &s;ee whether it is not &s;o con&s;tituted, that every man finds him&s;elf ready to admit the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles of religion, a&s;|&s;oon as they are offered to the mind, whether &s;ug|ge&s;ted by his own reflexions, or otherwi&s;e commu|nicated. Though we &s;hould allow almo&s;t in&s;upera|ble difficulty in arriving at the certain knowlege of one &s;upreme Being, the Creator and Lord of all; yet when by any means this primary truth is in ge|neral declared, it &s;trikes the mind with great power, every thing around us &s;erves to confirm it; <HI>the hea|vens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work, day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowlege.</HI> And when the unity and &s;pirituality of the Deity are clearly &s;ettled in the mind, his e&s;&s;ential attributes may be di&s;covered with|out any long laborious deductions. His <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>power</HI> in all his works &s;trike us with irre&s;i&s;tible con|viction; his <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> every where appears; and as <HI>King</HI> of the univer&s;e we are led to acknowlege him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the glorious qualifications for &s;uch boundle&s;s dominion. If we &s;hould meet with any great impediment in rea&s;oning more ab&s;tractly, in order to inve&s;tigate any of the divine attributes, an attentive view of the creation will lead us at once to di&s;cover what perfoctions, both natural and moral, nece&s;&s;arily belong to his nature: "<HI>for the vi&s;ible things of God are clearly &s;een, being known by the things which are made, even his eternal power and godhead.</HI> But if, in any re&s;pect, we &s;hould be liable to fail and err from the truth, when left merely to our own rea|&s;onings, if &s;ome friendly in&s;tructor gives better infor|mation, rea&s;on in&s;tantly feels the force of truth, with|out
<PB N="17" REF="014822_0015_0F95B36F133C58D0">the nece&s;&s;ity of a miraculous confirmation, unle&s;s &s;ome vicious bia&s;s intercepts the light.</P>
<P>And upon &s;uch a di&s;covery of the divine perfec|tions the mo&s;t important duties, which men owe their Creator and King, immediately appear &s;elf evi|dent; &s;uch as adoration, prayer, thank&s;giving, love, fear, confidence in his goodne&s;s, mercy and ju&s;tice, earne&s;t endeavors to plea&s;e him, and joy in the hope of his favor. And though we fir&s;t may be informed of the&s;e duties by revelation, yet rea&s;on unites with it in bearing te&s;timony, that the&s;e duties plainly re|&s;ult from the knowlege of God.</P>
<P>As to the morality of our conduct, with re&s;pect to our&s;elves and one another, it is &s;o evidently the <HI>Law of nature</HI> that we regulate our actions by rea&s;on and con&s;cience, that it will not admit any controver|&s;y: and as far as this makes a part of religion, the religion of nature appears to be univer&s;al. For they who are mo&s;t remote from all the advantages of an expre&s;s Law given from heaven in writing, are ne|verthele&s;s con&s;cious of a law written on their hearts, and <HI>"do by nature the things contained in the law."</HI> This is the ba&s;is of all the penal laws of civil &s;ociety. This is the foundation of all the charges which men bring, one again&s;t another, for any injuries receiv'd, the reproaches ca&s;t on men of bad morals, and the high commendations of men of exemplary virtue. In this part of religion men are mo&s;t univer&s;ally agreed in judgment, however vicious their practice may be: for all condemn murder, inju&s;tice, theft, adultery, lying, perjury, di&s;&s;imulation, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and every thing manife&s;tly fooli&s;h, irregular, and di&s;&s;olute in any man's per&s;onal behavior; and on the contrary, prai&s;e men for wi&s;dom, integrity, pa|trioti&s;m, liberality, moderation, temperance, and the like. Without any revelation, nature it&s;elf will teach the&s;e and all the larger branches of virtue and vice which cannot ea&s;ily be concealed: and when
<PB N="18" REF="014822_0016_0F95B36F37D843C0"><HI>revelation</HI> gives a more perfect di&s;covery of the&s;e things in their mo&s;t &s;ecret principles in the heart, <HI>rea&s;on and con&s;cience</HI> at once join in te&s;tifying the truth and peculiar excellency of the morals it teaches.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, we properly call that the <HI>Religion of nature,</HI> which may either be di&s;covered by the proper exerci&s;e of our rational faculties in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human nature, or which the rea&s;on of mankind cannot but approve as &s;oon as it is made known, without the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uperna|tural evidence: and what has been &s;aid may afford &s;ufficient evidence, that a general &s;en&s;e of religion is in&s;eparable from human nature; that though, in theory, we may imagine religion capable of being carried to great perfection by rea&s;on alone, yet in fact it needs the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine revelation to revive it's original &s;trength, and regain it's influence.</P>
<P>One thing more remains to be considered under this fir&s;t head, viz&mdash;How far all mankind are held under the obligations of natural religion.</P>
<P>Now the obligations of natural religion are of two kinds, viz. tho&s;e which are in&s;eparable from the power of rea&s;on and con&s;cience over men, even though they have no dread of a Supreme Being; and tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the con&s;ideration of the na|ture and univer&s;al government of the Deity. The&s;e obligations are of a moral nature, not implying irre|&s;i&s;tible compul&s;ion, but the criminality of di&s;obedi|ence, and the danger of &s;uffering &s;ome puni&s;hment for it, according to the very constitution of things, or by the ju&s;t re&s;entments of the Sovereign of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Reason and Con&s;cience,</HI> by the power they naturally have over men, oblige them to ob&s;erve the laws of nature, even though they have no dread of the Su|preme Being. For who dares to be guilty of &s;o great an ab&s;urdity, as to attempt to prove by rea&s;on. that he is no ways obliged to govern him&s;elf by the dic|tates
<PB N="19" REF="014822_0017_0F95B36FEC51A078">of natural rea&s;on? How is it po&s;&s;ible for a man to ju&s;tify to him&s;elf his own conduct, when he plainly &s;ees he is not ju&s;tifiable, but is acting contrary to truth and right, to wi&s;dom and prudence, and even the genuine principle of &s;elf-love? Can he blame, and feel re&s;entment again&s;t others, for doing wrong, and having no regard to their own or their neighbors welfare, and yet look on him&s;elf free from all re|&s;traint, and feel no unea&s;ine&s;s in his own mind, when he does the &s;ame things? To think our&s;elves at li|berty to act irrationally, is to renounce all the dig|nity of rational creatures, and &s;ink human nature even below the brutes, who uniformly act according to their &s;everal capacities and in&s;tincts. <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> making an in&s;tantaneous judgment of what is our duty, as a kind of in&s;tinct implanted in human na|ture to &s;erve the mo&s;t &s;udden occa&s;ions, cannot but have tender feelings, and give unea&s;ine&s;s whenever we neglect what we know ought to be done, or do what we cannot but condemn. The mind can have no &s;ettled peace, when our conduct is manife&s;tly con|trary to the principles we acknowlege; when we are quite regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences of our behavior, and are governed by no rules. If we live without any care of our morals, we mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to end|le&s;s vexatious reflexions on our &s;elves, as often as we feel the innumerable ill effects of our irregularities.</P>
<P>But when men likewi&s;e are per&s;uaded there is a God who governs the world, &s;o far as they acknow|lege the perfections of his nature, and his regard to the conduct of mankind as their Lawgiver and Judge, they confe&s;s their obligations to honor him, and obey that law which is in&s;eparable from their rational nature. The dread of his power and anger&punc; the de&s;ire of his favor, oblige us to comply with his will; and we are &s;o con&s;cious of this obligation, that we can by no means injoy peace and &s;atisfaction of mind, when we are guilty of tho&s;e things which are
<PB N="20" REF="014822_0018_0F95B370AC592E10">offen&s;ive to him! Every truth concerning the Deity which men di&s;cover, immediately produces a propor|tionate conviction of the importance of tho&s;e duties which re&s;ult from this knowlege; and the cleare&s;t knowlege brings us under the &s;tronge&s;t bonds: &s;o that no man, unle&s;s he is totally ignorant of God, can be in&s;en&s;ible of the obligations of religion. And &s;urely the advantage of a full revelation of God and his Will, mu&s;t be &s;o far from relaxing the bonds we are naturally under, that it rather becomes mo&s;t in|excu&s;ably criminal not to obey the truth &s;o perfectly made known; for revelation confirms every thing which the law of nature teaches, and requires the mo&s;t complete ob&s;ervance of the duties of it, in or|der to our highe&s;t advances in religion.</P>
<P>This reminds us of another general Head which may require &s;ome attention before we fini&s;h the Sub|ject.&mdash;It is comprehended in the following que&s;tion, viz.</P>
<P>II. How far do the Principles of <HI>natural religion</HI> coincide with <HI>Revelation;</HI> and in what re&s;pects do they tend to confirm Chri&s;tianity, and perfect that obedience which the Go&s;pel requires?</P>
<P>Now if Chri&s;tianity did not coincide with natu|ral religion, all the &s;upernatural evidences which ever were or might be adduced to prove the truth of it, would be utterly in&s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h it's credit; for no evidence can po&s;&s;ibly prevail again&s;t the con|&s;tant te&s;timony of Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, or the primary principles of truth implanted in human na|ture. For in&s;tance;&mdash;If Chri&s;tianity required us to believe the Supreme Being to be defective in Wi&s;|dom, of limited power, capable of fal&s;ifying his word, unrighteous and cruel in his government, or &s;o weakly mild and merciful as never to execute his threatnings again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of his laws, and the like, mankind could not be bound to receive &s;uch a religion: for by contradicting all the natural docu|ments
<PB N="21" REF="014822_0019_0F95B3719283F1C8">of Rea&s;on, it would intirely de&s;troy it's own authority. So it a &s;uppo&s;ed revelation &s;hould teach us, that men may live as they plea&s;e, bite and devour, murder and de&s;troy, rob and plunder, without crime or danger; and that God will &s;hew as much love and kindne&s;s to &s;uch per&s;ons, and make them as happy, as if they &s;hould give the mo&s;t &s;olemn attention to his voice, and di&s;cover the utmo&s;t concern to comply with the laws of nature and the expre&s;s commands of heaven; if it &s;hould pretend to a&s;&s;ure men, that there is no manner of difference between pur&s;uing a cour&s;e of abandoned wickedne&s;s, or hearkening to the dictates of con&s;cience, and improving every ad|vantage of gaining wi&s;dom, and finding the way to eternal happine&s;s; but they are more likely to be inlighened, and obtain all the blessings of the divine fa|vor in the former way than in the latter: &s;uch doctrines would be &s;o &s;hocking to common &s;en&s;e, &s;o de&s;tructive of all religion and morality, that rea&s;on and con'cience would <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> us in rejecting&mdash;yes, they would <HI>con|&s;train</HI> us to reject &s;uch a revelation, with the greate&s;t abhorrence.</P>
<P>But Chri&s;tianity is far from contradicting the prin|ciples of natural religion in the lea&s;t degree. It re|veals, indeed, &s;urprizing things which the light of nature never could have di&s;cover'd,&mdash;the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God perfectly reconcilable with the <HI>&s;evere&s;t Ju&s;tice</HI> and re&s;entment again&s;t &s;in; <HI>Mercy and Truth meeting together, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace ki&s;&s;ing each other!</HI>&mdash;the Law executed and fulfilled in every part, and the divine government honor'd, though the greate&s;t criminals may e&s;cape puni&s;hment and obtain heavenly glory!&mdash;the reconciliation of a rebellious condemned world to God, by the obedience and &s;ufferings of the Mediator! The Go&s;pel a&s;&s;ures us of a <HI>new ground</HI> of the ju&s;tification and &s;alvation of &s;inners, not by their own works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but on account of that perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us the Son of God,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="014822_0020_0F95B3749D6C64F8">which is well plea&s;ing to the Father; and a new way of our admittance to the injoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of God's love, viz. by our <HI>believing</HI> the te&s;timony of the Go&s;pel concerning the glorious characters and work of Chri&s;t;&mdash;<HI>believing effectually</HI> &s;o as to tru&s;t in him with all the heart to render us accepted in the &s;ight of his Father, and to di&s;cipline us for heavenly happine&s;s, and love and &s;erve him with fidelity. Where the light of nature fails the Go&s;pel offers it|&s;elf as an infallible guide, di&s;covering the things of God which could not be di&s;cerned by the naked eye or the human intellect, and correcting the errors of mi&s;guided rea&s;on; but it does not contradict any fir&s;t principles of rea&s;on, or any clear di&s;coveries it has ever made: No, they happily co-incide, and it confirms them all. Revelation teaches the &s;ame things with natural religion, but it teaches more; and rea&s;on and con&s;cience, if they judge impartially, mu&s;t allow the excellency of it's doctrines, and the &s;uperior advantages received from the light it com|municates. The attributes of the great Author of all things are placed in the mo&s;t glorious a&s;toni&s;hing point of view, and not only &s;o, but the mo&s;t refined branches of morality are laid open, the grande&s;t ar|guments for a &s;ober, righteous, and godly life are pre&s;ented, and in&s;tead of rectifying &s;ome particular irregularities of behavior, it aims at nothing le&s;s than &s;uch an intire change of the man, in his inmo&s;t prin|ciples, temper and affections, as well as outward con|duct, that he may well be denominated a new man, as if he were created over again, and had gained a new kind of life. Revelation aims to re&s;tore the &s;oul, to liberty from a &s;tate of ba&s;e &s;ervitude to the fle&s;h, to &s;piritualize or bring it to live agreeable to its own &s;pi|ritual nature, under the government of the Spirit of God,&mdash;to bring it to live as a citizen of heaven, by the cleare&s;t di&s;covery of &s;piritual and heavenly things, in hopes of being &s;hortly united with the &s;ociety of
<PB N="23" REF="014822_0021_0F95B375A39F4728">angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, and dwelling in the pre&s;ence of God forever.</P>
<P>Tho' Faith and Love are the capital graces of Chri&s;tianity, and the &s;um of all it's precepts, and we are taught not to claim the &s;pecial favor of God and eternal life on account of any virtues to which we have, or imagine we have, attained, or any labors we have performed; yet the Go&s;pel a&s;&s;ures us, that without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord, and re|quires believers to be perfect even as their Father in heaven is perfect: it does not allow them to &s;top &s;hort in their holy cour&s;e, but urges their ince&s;&s;ant progre&s;s from grace to grace, from virtue to virtue; and accordingly it delivers a great variety of parti|cular precepts for a godly and virtuous life.</P>
<P>But precepts can never be framed to &s;uit every action and every circum&s;tance in the practice of morality; therefore be&s;ides more particular rules of life, not to be equalled by the mo&s;t celebrated pre|cepts of boa&s;ting philo&s;ophy, our Divine Lord and Ma&s;ter has added new force to that capital Law of Nature, <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even the &s;ame unto them,</Q> by commanding his di&s;ciples to ob&s;erve it as the com|prehen&s;ive rule of Chri&s;tian morals. So St. Paul gives this &s;ummary direction&mdash;<HI>What&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t</HI> (i.e. honorable), <HI>what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, if there be any virtue and if there be any prai&s;e, think on the&s;e things:</HI> and in the apo&s;tolic epi&s;tles Chri&s;tians are excited both by exhortations and example to make it their con&s;tant care, and look upon it as a general rule of holy living, to keep a <HI>good con&s;cience</HI> in all things, &s;o that even their greate&s;t enemies might not be able to find any ju&s;t grounds of accu&s;ation again&s;t them. Now what can all this amount to, but a full confirmation of the Law of
<PB N="24" REF="014822_0022_0F95B377585D1F20">nature, and an implicit adoption of it into the &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o far as it toaches perfect morals? For, as to the practice of every thing which could not be enumerated in particular precepts, we are plainly referred to our own natural judgment and ob&s;ervation to determine what is ju&s;t and right, lovely and honorable: this is to be our guide in all circum&s;tances not ea&s;ily reducible to any &s;pecial rules, and we are required to conform our&s;elves to what common rea&s;on and natural con&s;cience will readily point out as our duty. And unle&s;s we thus attend to the law of nature for our direction in a multitude of ca&s;es, we &s;hall be in&s;en&s;ible of many defects in our temper and conduct, and cannot carry the practice of Chri&s;tian morality to the utmo&s;t per|fection de&s;igned.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay any thing more to &s;how how far natural religion and Chri&s;tianity co-incide, and how far they mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t and corroborate each other.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with a very few words of application.</P>
<P>Let us take heed of &s;etting up natural religion too high, &s;o as to vie with the honor of divine revelation: for none can tell whether the rea&s;on of man, ab&s;o|lutely left to it's own natural &s;trength, in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate, would ever have arrived at &s;uch a cer|tainty in the knowledge of the invi&s;ible things of God, as is nece&s;&s;ary in order to pure wor&s;hip and unre&s;erved obedience. While we pay due re&s;pect to the wi&s;dom of the heathen Sages, let us remember, that the &s;im|plicity of the Go&s;pel incomparably &s;urpa&s;&s;es all their labored philo&s;ophy. May the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t never exchange the glorious doctrines of the New-Te&s;tament for the deficient &s;chemes which men have invented, or magnify rea&s;on in any re&s;pect above the revelation of God by his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord! But let us humbly and thankfully &s;ubmit to the au|thority of the divine word, and make it our care to
<PB N="25" REF="014822_0023_0F95B377846F0668">teach the way of God in truth, and manife&s;t the favour of Chri&s;t's name in every place.</P>
<P>May all that are educated in this Seminary of Learning, con&s;ider the excellency of the holy Scriptures above all the Wi&s;dom of this world; and as they de&s;ire the true knowledge of God, and to find the way to peace and &s;atisfaction in this life, and happine&s;s in the world to come, may they never treat the &s;acred Oracles with bold contempt, or carele&s;s neglect! My dear Pupils, let me intreat you to read the Scriptures with the mo&s;t &s;erious and earne&s;t attention; make them your delightful &s;tudy; remember they teach divine <HI>&s;cience</HI> communicated from heaven to mankind,&mdash;<HI>&s;cience</HI> which tends to elevate the &s;oul, inlarge its views, fortify it again&s;t all fears in this world, and direct it in the way to heavenly glory. Prefer the word of God to the be&s;t productions of human genius, that you may grow in wi&s;dom every day, and not only be acquainted with the duties which nature teaches, and that Literature which may conduce to your credit and u&s;efulne&s;s in this world, but al&s;o may know Je&s;us Chri&s;t the divine Savior of mi&s;erable men, rejoice in his in&s;truction and government, yield to the power of religion, live a life of true godline&s;s and virtue, and having done eminent &s;ervice in your generation, may in the world to come obtain that glorious im|mortality which is the great promi&s;e of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Finally; let all Chri&s;tians glorify God, according to the peculiar advantages of knowing him with which they are favored. Let none of us be a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, or of tho&s;e religious affections and exerci&s;es which are nece&s;&s;ary for the honor of our God and Savior, and our advancement in a life of true holine&s;s. Rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and revelation, join in obliging us to pay our con&s;tant devotions to our Maker and Redeemer; and if we neglect to wor&s;hip and glorify the Eternal Father thro' his
<PB N="26" REF="014822_0024_0F95B3784967BAE8">Son Je&s;us, agreable to the revelation of his nature and Will, even the &s;uper&s;titious heathen will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t us. But while we attend to all the devotional duties of religion, let us not forget the great importance of morality, as it makes an e&s;&s;ential part of that holine&s;s which the Go&s;pel requires. If we de&s;ire to pre&s;s forward towards the perfection of the Chri&s;tian character, we mu&s;t not content our&s;elves with an apparent obedience to &s;ome of the primary precepts of the Go&s;pel, but continually judge within our own &s;elves what is right,&mdash;make the mo&s;t criti|cal ob&s;ervations on our&s;elves and others, that we may &s;ee what rea&s;on and con&s;cience approve or condemn, &mdash;and never allow our&s;elves in any temper or practice which may not be ju&s;tified both by the law of nature and the revealed rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s. We are re|quired to be <HI>holy</HI> as <HI>God is holy,</HI>&mdash;to be followers of him as dear children&mdash;and to be blamele&s;s and harm|le&s;s, as the Sons of God, without rebuke, &s;hining as lights in the world by the wi&s;dom and rectitude of every part of our conduct. Labour therefore, my Chri&s;tian brethren, to keep a good con&s;cience in all things; think and judge well what is right in the &s;ight of God and man in all circum&s;tances; adorn your Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion by adding to your faith all the virtues required both by natural and revealed re|ligion&mdash;And may the God of all grace, who hath called us into his kingdom and glory, make you perfect in every good work, and work in every one of us that which is well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord and Savior, in who&s;e name we will walk, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</P>
