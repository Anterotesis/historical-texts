<P>DISPASSIONATE enquiries concerning the public intere&s;ts, are attended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith &s;alutary effects, in every time and in every nation. In a country like that, which we inhabit, &s;uch examinations are unu&s;ually intere&s;ting, and may be rendered, it is believed, peculiarly beneficial.</P>
<P>To create the di&s;po&s;ition requi&s;ite to the proper acceptation of &s;uch di&s;qui|&s;itions, it is nece&s;&s;ary to call to the public mind the variant characters of the &s;everal &s;tates when they were provinces of a more extended empire&mdash;the cau&s;es which produced that difference of character&mdash;the means which were devi&s;ed to increa&s;e and perpetuate that variation and the ends to which tho&s;e characteri&s;tic differences were intended to be in&s;trumental. Reflexions duly &s;erious upon the&s;e circum&s;tances will remind the people of the &s;everal &s;tates, that they are natural friends, who&s;e amity and union have been too often viewed with jealou&s;y by rival eyes. They will perceive the wi&s;dom and the high duty of cultivating a &s;pirit of mutual allowance and conce&s;&s;ion; and a careful examination of their actual &s;itua|tion will convince them, that greater ble&s;&s;ings will re&s;ult from a perfect under|&s;tanding, and &s;edulous cultivation of their intere&s;ts at home, than from almo&s;t any arrangements, which the conceptions of foreign nations will probably lead them to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation and of &s;ome intere&s;ting circum|&s;tances which have grown out of it, is the object of this inve&s;tigation, in which the benefits to be derived from a liberal intercour&s;e with foreign na|tions will not be undervalued. As no apology is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an endea|vour, a mi&s;cellaneous enquiry into &s;everal matters, which are always deeply inte|re&s;ting to nations, and into others which have re&s;ulted from our public operations, will be pro&s;ecuted without further introduction.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning the exports of the united &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P>It has been apprehended by per&s;ons of ob&s;ervation, at home, and the idea has prevailed in the councils of a foreign nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the report of a committee of the lords of the Briti&s;h privy council, pub|i&s;hed in the gazettes (of March) in Charle&s;ton, South Carolina.</NOTE>, that the exports of the united &s;tates for the year preceding October, 1790, were greater in value than could be expected again, by rea&s;on of the prices for grain which were con&s;equent on
<PB N="4" REF="024230_0003_0FC57E23A7438380">the &s;carcity in France. The exports of the &s;ub&s;equent year will aid us in te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing this opinion, which attracts the more attention, becau&s;e it is &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;ted that agriculture and trade have been injured by the mea&s;ures of the government in regard to the public debt. The fir&s;t return of exports, on which this conjecture was founded, includes a term of thirteen months and a half, and amounted to 20,415,966 dollars. From this aggregate value a ninth part is to be deducted, to equalize it with one year's exportation, which reduces the &s;um to 18,147,526 dollars. It is very well known, that the prices of our produce through the year lately returned, and which ended with September 1791, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llen to their an|tecedent rates, and it will be perceived on a compari&s;on, that our exports ex|ceeded in their aggregate value tho&s;e of the former year. The la&s;t return, ex|clu&s;ively of two quarters of Charle&s;ton, was

<P>There remains not, therefore, the lea&s;t cau&s;e to doubt, that our total expor|tations were eighteen millions and a quarter, and con&s;equently more than in the antecedent year. It is to be ob&s;erved, too, that the high prices which were current through the time of the fir&s;t return, mu&s;t have produced an exportation of all the grain, that could be got to market, and none of the old crop could have been left as u&s;ual, to &s;ell with the new. The obvious effect of this mu&s;t have been an unu&s;ual deduction from the exports in the la&s;t year. The valuation of the exports of the&s;e &s;tates immediately before the revolution is not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ly a&s;certained: but the whole exportations from N. America, including the remain|ing colonies, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and the Bahamas, were computed to have been in 1771&punc; dollars, 15,280,000. In the&s;e were compri&s;ed the &s;hipments between tho&s;e i&s;lands and the main, and from province to province, as every ve&s;&s;el, which departed from one American port for another, was obliged to clear out her cargo, as if de&s;tined for a foreign country. It will appear to be &s;afe to &s;ub|tract for the difference produced by the&s;e two circum&s;tances, one half of the former exports, when it is remembered that two-thirds of the quantity of tonnage is em|ployed in the intercour&s;e between the various parts of the pre&s;ent union, which is engaged in that with foreign nations; and that the Briti&s;h Newfoundland fi&s;hery alone, was e&s;timated at more than 2,200,000 dollars in 1775. The increa&s;e of the tonnage employed in the foreign trade affords another proof of the increment of our exports. About 330,000 tons were laden in the pre&s;ent united &s;tates in the year 1770, part of which were de&s;tined for ports now within the union. About 600,000 tons have been loaded in each of the two la&s;t years for foreign ports, though our exports being in a much greater degree manufactured, are now contained in a &s;maller compa&s;s: and boards, &s;cantling, and &s;taves, which are our mo&s;t bulky commodities, have not increa&s;ed in half the ratio of the tonnage employed.</P>
<P>An addition may be al&s;o made to the amount of the return for the increa&s;ed &s;upplies in provi&s;ions, cordage, and other materials, for the u&s;e and outfit of foreign &s;hips. Since the prices of &s;alt provi&s;ions have been reduced below tho&s;e of Ireland, and many articles applicable to &s;hips' u&s;e, have been manufactured here, this item has become very con&s;iderable; and &s;o far as the articles are &s;old to foreigners, they are e&s;&s;entially exports.</P>
<P>Under this head, the increa&s;ed number of &s;hips &s;old to foreign nations, may be fairly mentioned, and although much has been &s;aid of the number formerly di&s;po&s;ed of abroad, it is not doubted that a greater value was &s;old in that way in the time of the la&s;t return. Of this fact &s;ome further illu&s;tration will probably be given in the &s;equel. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that the whole quantity
<PB N="5" REF="024230_0004_0FC57E298F112998" MS="y">of tonnage built, and native ve&s;&s;els repaired the la&s;t year, exceed in value one million of dollars.</P>
<P>The enlarged con&s;umption made within our country by foreign per&s;ons of every de&s;cription, who are certainly much more numerous than they formerly were, is as profitable to the country, as the &s;ame value in exports would have been. This item will appear to be very con&s;iderable, when the expenditures of foreign mini&s;ters, con&s;uls, tran&s;ient and re&s;ident foreigners, fleets and &s;eamen, mind.</P>
<P>The export trade of the united &s;tates and the great increa&s;e of the home con|&s;umption have placed the American producers on a very advantageous footing. The competition which exi&s;ts in our markets, between the purcha&s;ers for the ac|count of foreigner, of various nations, for our own merchants, for the great con|&s;umption in the &s;eaports and parts adjacent to the coa&s;ts, and for the u&s;e of the ma|nufacturers, together with the occa&s;ional &s;hipments made on their own accounts by the &s;outhern planters, by the millers of the middle &s;tates, and by the owners of the ea&s;tern fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, afford the cultivators and fi&s;hermen &s;o many alter|natives, that they can always obtain the be&s;t prices which circum&s;tances will ju&s;tify. In &s;hort, the&s;e &s;everal demands, at once various, &s;teady, and exten&s;ive, efficiently &s;upport our agriculture: and though peculiar enterprize and faculties in commerce and manufactures, the power of capital, and an intimate know|ledge of our trade and interior &s;y&s;tem, enable a particular nation to participate largely in the exports of the united &s;tates, the remainder of the world receive from us a very con&s;iderable value, and the variety of demand which the de&s;ti|nation of our exports proves to exi&s;t, affords us certain relief from the con&s;e|quences of the commercial errors of any of tho&s;e countries, who&s;e citizens are our con&s;umers. Whenever &s;uch errors &s;hall occur&mdash;or &s;o far as they may have already taken place, to diffu&s;e a knowledge of our re&s;ources among all nations, to in&s;pire them with confidence in our laws and modes of dealing, and to con|vert our commodities by manufactures, into every &s;hape which their occa&s;ions may require, will prove the efficacious corrective, by enabling us to obtain from wi&s;e nations a favourable market for our productions.</P>
<P>It is &s;atisfactory to ob&s;erve the regular increa&s;e of manufactured goods in our returns of exported commodities. The number in each of the two la&s;t years is upwards of one third, in a li&s;t which amounts to near three hundred article. Hence we may infer, that <HI>the time is really arrived, when foreign trade is increa&s;ed and enlivened by home manufactures.</HI> This idea, together with the dome&s;tic commerce produced by them, will be more particularly no|ticed in another place.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning the manufactures of the united &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;idering this &s;ubject it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to adduce any arguments to influence the judgment of the ea&s;tern parts of the union. Many of our citizens near the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the middle &s;tates are equally convinced of the beneficial effects of manufactures. The cultivators in the &s;outhern and we&s;tern country, and a re&s;pectable proportion of our mercantile citizens are apprehen&s;ive of in|jury to them&s;elves and to their country from the pur&s;uit of this object. The&s;e are two de&s;criptions of per&s;ons whom it is in every view our duty to &s;atisfy, if the truth and rea&s;on will permit; and it is principally from a due attention to them, that the &s;ubject i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> propo&s;ed to be examined here.</P>
<P>An opinion has prevailed that the &s;outhern &s;tates will be &s;acrificed to the ea&s;tern, and in &s;ome degree to the middle &s;tates, by the plan of manufactures. It is plain, however, that as the &s;oil of the ea&s;tern &s;tates is not equal to the production of a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ions and raw materials for their own u&s;e, they mu&s;t re&s;ort to the more &s;outhern &s;tates for &s;everal raw materials and for new &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. It is known, too, that &s;ome valuable articles for ma|nufactures
<PB N="6" REF="024230_0005_0FC57E2B251C59D8">cannot be produced but in the &s;outhern &s;tates, &s;uch as cotton, and indigo, and that tobacco is almo&s;t confined to them. The &s;outhern &s;tates and we&s;tern country will have con&s;iderable advantages in the &s;upport which the home market of the manufacturers will give at all times, and e&s;pecially in time of war, (when freights will be high, and &s;hipping &s;carce) to their agricultural and land|ed productions. Even now, in profound peace, it is the ca&s;e. Hemp was deli|vered in the ports of the middle &s;tates, from the lands of the &s;outhern &s;tates, at le&s;s than five cents per <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> in 1791. Nothing would have kept it up to that rate, but the rope and twine manufactories of the middle and ea&s;tern &s;tates. The breweries of Philadelphia draw nearly as much of their barley from the Che&s;a|peak as they derive from the lands of Penn&s;ylvania. The&s;e and other facts &s;how the beneficial beginning of things. The manufacturers of &s;hips and cordage throughout the unio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> procure from the &s;outhern &s;tates all their tar, pitch, tur|pentine, oil of turpentine, and ro&s;in. The ports of Philadelphia and New York, take three-fourths of their &s;hip timber from them, ju&s;tly preferring ve&s;&s;els of live oak and red cedar to all others. The owners of the coal mines of Virginia, enjoy the monopoly of all the &s;upplies for the manufacturers of the more northern &s;tates, who live in the &s;ea ports: a demand which is increa&s;ing rapidly. No lead mine of any con&s;equence is yet worked, except one near the &s;uperior waters of James river. The &s;outhern &s;tates abound with iron, and have much more fuel of all kinds than the northern &s;tates, and they have &s;treams for the mo&s;t power|ful water works. Few or no very abundant depo&s;its of coal have been yet di&s;co|vered further north or ea&s;t than the waters of the Ohio and Che&s;apeak, even in internal &s;ituations. The iron manufactures of the united &s;tates are already im|portant in value, and immen&s;ely &s;o in point of utility, or rather of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> Farms, manufactories, &s;hipping, fi&s;heries, fleets, and armies, all demand them. In &s;hort, the all-important landed intere&s;t would langui&s;h, and its progre&s;s in pro&s;perity would be retarded in the counties of the &s;outhern &s;tates, even near the &s;ea, if our pre&s;ent manufactures were to be aboli&s;hed, and all future e&s;ta|bli&s;hments of that kind were to be given up. <HI>But their inland and we&s;tern coun|ties cannot be &s;upported, unle&s;s manufactures &s;hall be promoted and introduced a|mong them.</HI> In the counties of Penn&s;ylvania beyond the Allegany mountain, are 63,000 inhabitants, and probably 10,000 of the&s;e are farmers. The <HI>wool</HI> of that country is yet very incon&s;iderable&mdash;their furs are more abundant. From the&s;e two raw materials, no le&s;s than 10,140 wool hats, and 2,200 fur hats are manufactured yearly in thirty-three hatters' &s;hops. Sail cloth, (which, when manufactured, would be worth 30 cents per <ABBR>lb.</ABBR>) could be made at Pitt&s;burg, Winche&s;ter in Virginia, Hill&s;borough, and Sali&s;bury in North Carolina, Camden in South Carolina, and Augu&s;ta in Georgia, out of hemp, the value of which, there, does not exceed 4 or 5 cents. To bring a ton of hemp to the &s;ea ports from tho&s;e towns, except Augu&s;ta, co&s;ts from 35 to 40 per cent. of its va|lue. To bring a ten weight of &s;ail cloth from the &s;ame places to the &s;ame ports would not co&s;t above 6 or 8 per cent. and the manufacturers' provi&s;ions and fuel are attended with &s;imilar &s;avings. Deduct for a moment the demand of fo|reign commerce from both Alexandria and Winche&s;ter, and the latter would appear to be mo&s;t vigorous and flouri&s;hing; becau&s;e it manufactures more, having not &s;o high a market for its provi&s;ions and raw materials. The&s;e ob&s;er|vations apply with equal force to the whole &s;tate of Vermont and to all our interior country. The nation that &s;upplies us with hempen, flaxen, and iron ma|nufactures, takes immen&s;e quantities of hemp, flax, and iron from Ru&s;&s;ia. The&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian raw materials are purcha&s;ed at the ea&s;tern extremity of the Baltic, are tran&s;ported to another country and manufactured there, are brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ther, and haled through bad roads, 50, 10, 200, and 300 miles into our mo&s;t pro|ductive counties, which yield the requi&s;ite raw materials. The&s;e facts power|fully
<PB N="7" REF="024230_0006_0FC57E2CA3ADD1D0">incite us to fo&s;ter manufactures of the &s;ame kinds, there and el&s;ewhere. Till that &s;hall be the ca&s;e, we &s;hall continue to drag tho&s;e raw materials through the &s;ame bad roads, and &s;hip them under charges of carting and freight equal to a third, an half, and two thirds of their value, according to the di&s;tance. The pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of neglecting and repelling the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures, ap|pears to occa&s;ion immen&s;e deductions from the profits of our lands; and due con&s;ideration, it is believed, would convince us, that the be&s;t intere&s;ts, nay the nece&s;&s;ities of our landholders require the introduction of &s;ome kind of manu|factory in almo&s;t every vicinity.</P>
<P>The countries &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania are remarkably rich in fo&s;&s;ils. Coal, cop|per, iron, lead, and other minerals are found in either Maryland, Virginia, North or South Carolina, or Georgia, or all of them. Mineral appearances occur every|where. The promotion of manufactures is nece&s;&s;ary to draw the&s;e forth; and as they have immen&s;e fore&s;ts of wood, and the mo&s;t powerful mill-&s;treams, there can be no doubt, that they will be brought into u&s;e, as &s;oon as tho&s;e means &s;hall be adopted.</P>
<P>The family manufactures of the middle and interior counties of Virginia, North Carolina, and the interior counties of Georgia, South Carolina, and Ma|ryland are &s;aid to be greater in value, than the articles of foreign manufactures, which they u&s;e; and were they univer&s;ally awake to the facility, profits, and national importance of this mode of manufacturing, they might extend it much further, without impeding their farming operations, while, at the &s;ame time, they would provide a new u&s;e for their agricultural productions.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle &s;tate, Penn&s;ylvania, has upwards of fifty paper mills, which work up materials of no value. The manufactures from tho&s;e mills are computed at two hundred and fifty thou&s;and dollars&mdash;the hands employed in them do not exceed one hundred and fifty, or two hundred. That &s;tate contains about one ninth of the people of the united &s;tates, and their contributions to the expen&s;es of the government and the intere&s;t of the public debt, are con&s;equently about 400,000 dollars. Their paper-mills, therefore, indemnify them for five-eights of their quota! It is the duty of government to encourage the other &s;tates to do the &s;ame, e&s;pecially as it can be done by <HI>water-means,</HI> and not by <HI>men</HI> diverted from their farms. The &s;outhern &s;tates do not want a capacity for this manufac|ture, which has acquired an e&s;tabli&s;hment in Maryland, and has appeared as far to the &s;outhward as North Carolina.</P>
<P>It may be &s;afely affirmed, that the manufactures of <HI>leather</HI> in the united &s;tates exceed in value <HI>all our annual burdens.</HI> We import few or no &s;hoes. In each of the two la&s;t years we have procured from abroad no more than 70,000 pair of &s;hoes and boots for 4,000,000 of people. If we u&s;e only one pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and a half per annum per per&s;on, at &s;eventy-five cents, they will amount to 4,500,000 dollars, which exceeds every demand of the general and &s;tate governments. The hides, &s;kins, bark, lime, thread, bri&s;tles, and wax, nay, the very heel-pegs, are all drawn from our lands and farms. Recollecting this, and &s;imilar facts, we cannot que&s;tion the utility of manufactures to the farmers, planters, and landed intere&s;t. If the manufacture of &s;hoes in this country, were aboli&s;hed, our annual debt to foreign countries would be increa&s;ed to an amount equal to all our public contributions. Similar ob&s;ervations might be made on &s;everal other articles, though on none to &s;o great an extent. Cattle thrive with little attention in the mild winters of the &s;outh, and being more woody, they have a greater quantity of bark than mo&s;t of the other &s;tates.</P>
<P>The manufactures of wool in Great Britain have been &s;tated by their mini&s;ters at &pound;. 16,800,000 &s;terling&mdash;and the &s;imple manufactures of liquors in that country are &s;aid to con&s;ume twenty-five millions of bu&s;hels of grain. Were there no other proofs, we could not doubt the importance of manufacture, to
<PB N="8" REF="024230_0007_0FC57E30648741E0">the agriculture of that country. They nouri&s;h and &s;upport it. We make up all our wool&mdash;our lands produce cotton with great facility; and we manufacture liquors as ea&s;ily as Britain. There is no doubt, that the latter branch already affords to our farmers an <HI>annual market</HI> for 1,0,000 bu&s;hels of grain. This manufacture is well under&s;tood and carried on in all the &s;outhern &s;tates.</P>
<P>The objection, that manufactures take the people from agriculture, is not &s;o|lid, as el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved; &s;ince women, children, hor&s;es, water, and fire, all work at manufactures, and perform four-fifths of the labour; and as many manufacturers migrate to the united &s;tates, it may be fairly que&s;tioned, whe|ther the <HI>quantity</HI> of agricultural indu&s;try is not <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> by the impul&s;e and demand a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ing from manufactures, though a few cultivators &s;hould follow them. And it may be a&s;ked, whether a farmer does not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e <HI>the more</HI> cotton, flax, hemp, and wool, becau&s;e his wife and daughters <HI>&s;pin</HI> and weave them, or becau&s;e a water-work &s;pins for them?</P>
<P>The employment of the new medium, the public certificates (which may be taken at &pound;. 15,000,000 &s;terling) in a country that formerly had no. &pound; 3,000,000 &s;terling of medium, renders manufactures nece&s;&s;ary at the time. It may be &s;aid, lands will employ it. But farms &s;old well at the time when &pound;. 3,000,000 &s;terling was probably the utmo&s;t ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of our medium, and cannot therefore give employment to the additional <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ve millions, though they might to a part of it.

<HEAD><HI>NUMBER II.</HI> Concerning the manufactures of the united &s;tates.</HEAD>
<P>IN pur&s;uing the con&s;ideration of American manufactures as beneficial and nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;outhern &s;tates, it will be u&s;eful to take a cur&s;ory view of the indications of attachment and di&s;po&s;ition to them, which are di&s;covera|ble in that quarter.</P>
<P>Virginia appears to be making a greater <HI>progre&s;s</HI> in merchant mills than any &s;tate in the union, though &s;ome are yet far before her in tho&s;e beneficial works. Maryland and Delaware which are in the &s;outhern moiety, are &s;econd only to Penn&s;ylvania in this branch. There is little doubt that more <HI>pig and bar iron</HI> is made to the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylania, than to the northward of it. A lead mine has been opened in Virginia which is extending its &s;upplies through the union, and promi&s;es fair to be commen&s;urate with the pre&s;ent demand: and there is one, which is now worked, in the territory &s;outh of the Ohio. But no lead mines are in con&s;iderable operation in the &s;tates north or ea&s;t of Virginia, though a &s;mall beginning upon one in the we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania is made. An a&s;&s;ociation in Virginia, another in the territory &s;outh of the Ohio, and a company in the we&s;tern di&s;trict of South Carolina, have provided them&s;elves with carding and &s;pinning machinery on the Briti&s;h plan, to manufacture their <HI>native</HI> cotton. The planters in the &s;outhern &s;tates rai&s;e quantities of this raw material, unthought of before the war, and until the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the &s;ubject of manufactures, which took place after the treaty of peace. The family manufactures in <HI>cotton</HI> are much greater in the four &s;outhernmo&s;t &s;tates, than in the four ea&s;tern &s;tates. There are not wanting con&s;iderable numbers of <HI>&s;heep</HI> in the five &s;outhern &s;tates, yet by the two re|turns of exports, it appears that no <HI>wool</HI> has been &s;ent <HI>from thence</HI> to foreign markets. It has been common to receive wool in Penn&s;ylvania from the ea&s;tern &s;tates, though they manufacture &s;o much, but it is not known that any is ever received there for &s;ale from the &s;outhern &s;tates. Wool has been tran&s;ported to Salem in North Carolina, and to Winche&s;ter in Virginia, from the city of Phi|ladelphia, for the hat manufactory.</P>
<P>There has been full as great a current of emigration of <HI>flour millers, black|&s;miths, tanners, hatters, cabinet-makers, di&s;tillers, coopers, &amp;c.</HI> to the &s;outhern &s;tates from tho&s;e north of them, in proportion to numbers as of farmers; &s;o that the work&s;hops of the middle and northern &s;tates yield a double benefit to their fellow citizens in the &s;outh, in &s;upplying them with manufactures, and artizans.</P>
<P>There is greater <HI>variety</HI> in di&s;tillation in the four &s;outhern &s;tates than in the four ea&s;tern&mdash;that is, <HI>the manufactory is e&s;tabli&s;hed on a broader ba&s;is.</HI> It is al&s;o more <HI>certain</HI> in the &s;outh than in the north. In the latter, mela&s;&s;es is the principal ingredient and being from an external &s;ource, may be lo&s;t to the ea&s;tern di&s;tillers. Their manufactory is even now at hazard, unle&s;s they re|&s;ort to the grain of the country to the &s;outhward of them. But in the &s;outh|ern &s;tates they manufacture &s;pirits from melai&s;es, peaches, apples, &s;everal kinds of grain, and probably will, as their country is cleared, extend it to <HI>the grape.</HI> This has been tried with &s;ucce&s;s in the experimental way, at Galliopolis, near the Scioto.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature of North Carolina made a loan of money &s;ince the late war to a&s;&s;i&s;t introduction of the paper manufactory.</P>
<P>An a&s;&s;ociation, containing forty of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable planters and far|mers, in the we&s;tern di&s;trict of South Carolina, has been e&s;tabli&s;hed within a
<PB N="10" REF="024230_0009_0FC57E33638E7A60">few years for the promotion of manufactures, and agriculture. A &s;ub&s;cription to the amount of about 25,000 dollars has been made in the territory &s;outh of the Ohio for the purpo&s;e of carrying on the cotton manufactory. An indication of zeal not equalled in any middle or northern &s;tate, con&s;idering that the whole population of the government is 30,000 whites, and 5,000 blacks.</P>
<P>The preparation of tar, pitch, turpentine, &s;pirits of turpentine, and ro&s;in, in North Carolina and its vicinity, may be deemed a manufacture as ju&s;tly as the making of lin&s;eed oil, pota&s;h, or ordinary tanning. A very &s;mall quan|tity indeed, of the&s;e articles, will be made in the &s;tates north of Virginia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;e nature forbals; but they will, from obvious rea&s;ons, increa&s;e in the &s;outh.</P>
<P>During the exi&s;tance of the &s;tate impo&s;t laws, two of the &s;outhern &s;tates (Maryland and Virginia) impo&s;ed extra tonnage, not only upon foreign &s;hips, put upon tho&s;e of the other &s;tates, by which they evinced a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to encourage the <HI>manufacture of &s;hips.</HI> The &s;ame two &s;tates laid duties on the importation of &s;pirits manufactured in the other parts of the union.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Maryland impo&s;ed con&s;iderable protecting duties to encourage their own manufactures. The legi&s;lature of Maryland have encouraged the gla&s;s manufactory in that &s;tate by a con&s;iderable loan. That of Virginia pa&s;&s;ed a &s;pecial act &s;ince the peace, to encourage the manufactory of &s;nuff and tobacco.</P>
<P>There are more factories of <HI>cordage and cables</HI> in two of the &s;outhern &s;tates, Maryland and Virginia, than in any two of the &s;tates of New Jer&s;ey, New York, Connecticut, and New Hamp&s;hire. Virginia laid a duty of two-thirds of a dollar on cordage by her &s;tate impo&s;t law.</P>
<P>The important manufactory of &s;hips has become greater in each of the three &s;tates of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, than it now is in New Hamp&s;hire. The &s;outhern &s;tate of Maryland manufactured in 1790 as many ve&s;&s;els as any two of the northern &s;tates of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode I&s;land.</P>
<P>The paper-mill in the united &s;tates, which is mo&s;t remote from the &s;ea, is to be found in the town of Salem, in North Carolina, three hundred miles from the &s;ea. No &s;uch manufactu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es as tho&s;e of that vill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge (a Moravian &s;ettlement) in the &s;outhern &s;tate of North Carolina, exi&s;t in any part of the union north of Maryland, equally remote from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>There is one &s;cene only, in the Atlantic counties, in which coal, iron, and waterfalls are found together in abundance. That &s;cene, is therefore, peculiarly qualified for the iron branch of manufactures. The city of Richmond on the banks of James river, in Virginia, which is the place contemplated, may be con&s;idered in a permanent view as having an inconte&s;table natural advantage over any more northern &s;eaport in this intere&s;ting branch. How profitable would it be to Virginia, were all her pig and bar iron pa&s;&s;ed under the tilt hammers or through the rolling and &s;litting mills which might be erected at that place.</P>
<P>Some of the produce of the fi&s;heries, as before ob&s;erved, are to be deemed manufactures. The he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing and &s;had (or river and bay) fi&s;heries, &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania are very con&s;iderable. A barrel of herrings is worth, on a me|dium at the fi&s;hing places, 250 cents. The manufactu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the ca&s;k, the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck|ing, curing, making pickle, and trimming, amount to more than one fourth of the &s;um or twenty five per centum.

A barrel of <HI>pickled fi&s;h</HI> of the &s;outhern &s;tates may be therefore as ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> deemed a manufacture, as a ca&s;t of country rum. A &s;imilar compari&s;on might be made between this article and &s;everal other &s;im|ple
<PB N="11" REF="024230_0010_0FC57E3A4E97A820">manufactures of the middle and ea&s;tern parts of the union. It is not intend|ed to di&s;cu&s;s the propriety of granting bounties, but if they were deemed pro|per grants, there are points of view in which the &s;outhern &s;tates would ap|pear to have a greater intere&s;t in them, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the ea&s;tern &s;tates.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As the &s;outhern &s;tates cultivate <HI>a greater variety of raw articles</HI>&mdash;and are capable of producing <HI>a much larger quantity</HI> of them, all that exten&s;ive cla&s;s of bounties, which are re&s;olvable into an encouragement to the growth of the raw material, will be much more beneficial to them, than to the ea&s;tern &s;tates, which are more limited both in the kinds and quantities they can bring forward for the bounty.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The &s;outhern &s;tates having exten&s;ive and very rich interior and we&s;|tern counti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, far from navigable rivers, (which the ea&s;tern have not) and the productions of tho&s;e &s;cenes being liable to a long and expen&s;ive land carriage, the bounty would &s;oon be found to enable them to bring the &s;imple manufactures and raw materials to the markets on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, which they would not, without the bounty, attempt to tran&s;port. This will not be deemed a mere &s;ug|ge&s;tion of ingenuity, when it is remembered that the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h give bounties on their fabrics, and even on the bulky articles of flour, grain, and bi&s;cuit, to <HI>enable the exporter to deliver them with advantage in foreign mar|kets.</HI></P>
<P>It is an obvious truth, that every thing is more valuable in proportion to the number and extent of its <HI>u&s;es,</HI> or the purpo&s;es to which it can be advantageou&s;|ly applied. Flax, hemp, wool, &s;ilk, cotton, indigo, tobacco, hides, iron, wood, grain, and cattle, are valuable, where they are wanted merely as exports; but they manife&s;tly acquire a new value, when wanted to employ, accommodate or nouri&s;h man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">facturers. In places from whence tho&s;e articles cannot be export|ed, without a great expen&s;e of tran&s;portation, it is very de&s;irable to give them this <HI>&s;econd u&s;e</HI> but in &s;ituations too interior to be affected by the demand for exportation, and where of cour&s;e they are not required for the purpo&s;es of ex|ternal commerce, this new u&s;e mu&s;t be created for them, or <HI>they will not be pro|duced,</HI> and agriculture will con&s;equently langui&s;h. This view of the &s;ubject &s;ug|ge&s;ts the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of manufactures to the pro&s;perity of the interior and we&s;tern country as before intimated. Nor will the&s;e ideas appear, on examina|tion, to be merely plau&s;ible conjectures. They are no le&s;s &s;upported by the &s;tate of things, than by probability and rea&s;on. The towns of Wa&s;hington, Pitts|burg, Bedford, and Huntingdon, in Penn&s;ylvania, (the neare&s;t of which is 150 miles from a &s;ea port, exhibit the &s;tronge&s;t proofs, that manufactures are the be&s;t &s;upport of the interior landed intere&s;t, and are nece&s;&s;ary at once to the ac|commodation and pro&s;perity of the cultivators of the middle and we&s;tern coun|try. The following table contains an account of the population of tho&s;e vil|lages, which is not exagerated.</P>

<P>It appears from this table, that in tho&s;e county towns (or &s;eats of ju&s;tice) in the interior and we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania, the nece&s;&s;ity for manufactures has occa&s;ioned a little congregation of artizans, in the proportion of twenty-&s;e|ven parts in one hundred, of the whole village in the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance, and in the proportion of thirty-&s;even parts in one hundred, in the large&s;t. The town of Wa&s;hington, which is the mo&s;t remote, and is beyond the Ohio, has been created &s;ince the late war. Its di&s;tance is about 300 miles we&s;t of Philadelphia. The variety of its manufactures is &s;triking, and it may he &s;afely affirmed, that at the &s;eats of ju&s;tice, in the counties of Delaware, Bucks, Che&s;ter, and Mont|gomery, which are neare&s;t to Philadelphia, as great a number of manufacturers, in proportion to their re&s;pective population, does not exi&s;t, though the family manufactures are more con&s;iderable in the&s;e, and though they have numerous tanneries, iron works, powder mills, paper mills, black&s;miths, hatters, &s;hoema|kers, weavers, and other valuable workmen, in their villages and &s;cattered throughout their populous town&s;hips. This, however, is the ca&s;e, in &s;ome de|gree, likewi&s;e in the town&s;hips of the we&s;tern &s;cene above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the midland counties of Penn&s;ylvania, manufactures have re&s;ulted from <HI>a flouri&s;hing agriculture,</HI> and, immediately on their birth, have contributed to the pro&s;perity of the cultivators. The borough of Lanca&s;ter, which is the large&s;t inland town in the united &s;tates, is &s;ixty-&s;ix miles from a &s;eaport, and ten from any practi&s;ed boat navigation. The number of families was in 1786, about 700, of whom 234 were manufacturers. The following is the li&s;t of them. Fourteen hatters, thirty-&s;ix &s;hoemakers, four tanners, &s;eventeen &s;addlers, twen|ty-five tailors, twenty-five weavers of woolen, linen, and cotton cloth, three &s;tocking weavers, twenty-five white and black &s;miths, &s;ix wheelwrights, eleven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pers, &s;ix clock and watchmakers, &s;ix tobacco and &s;nuff manufacturers, four
<PB N="13" REF="024230_0012_0FC57E3D2509C020">dyers, &s;even gun &s;miths, five rope makers, four tinners, two bra&s;s founders, three &s;kin dre&s;&s;ers, one bru&s;h maker, &s;even turners, &s;even nail makers, five &s;il|ver &s;miths, three potters, three brewers, three copper&s;miths, and two printers in Engli&s;h and German. There were in 1786, al&s;o within thirty-nine miles of the town, &s;eventeen furnaces, forges, rolling mills and &s;litting mills, and within ten miles of it eighteen corn mills, &s;ixteen &s;aw mills, one fulling mill, four oil mills, five hemp mills, two boreing and grinding mills for gun barrels, and eight tanneries. The increa&s;e &s;ince 1786, mu&s;t have been very con&s;iderable; for the attention of the united &s;tates has been very much turned to manufactures &s;ince the year 1787. It may be &s;afely affirmed, that the counties of Lanca&s;ter (in which the borough is) York and Berks are the mo&s;t vigorous in Penn&s;ylvania, perhaps in the union, and that there are none in the &s;tate in which there are more manufactures, is beyond all que&s;tion. They are all fifty miles or more, from the neare&s;t &s;eaport. Information through &s;everal channels, affords the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that the interior of Frederick and Elizabeth towns in Maryland, Stanton in Vir|ginia, Lexington in Kentucky and other towns in the &s;outhern &s;tates, would prove on examination, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania, and that the improvements in nece&s;&s;ary manufactures are as vi&s;ible and as rapid, as tho&s;e in agriculture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following account of the &s;ize and of the manufactures of Winche&s;ter, in Virginia, is furni&s;hed by a per&s;on lately a re&s;ident in that place.

<P><HI>Concerning the manufactures of the united &s;tates, as they affect the mercantile in|tere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Many of the &s;hip holders and merchants trading with foreign countries, &s;uppo&s;e, but it is believed erroneou&s;ly, that they have no intere&s;t in the promotion of ma|nufactures. It is known that Great Britain with &s;eventy millions of acrea of cultivated land, &s;hips fourteen millions (her whole exports being near twenty millions, in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r own manufactures. The foreign trade of that kingdom, without manufactures, would manife&s;tly be neither &s;o great nor &s;o various&mdash;for the va|lue of the produce manufactured is increa&s;ed from one hundred to ten hundred per cent, as is al&s;o that of the imported raw materials, which con&s;titute a great portion of their trade. The foreign commerce of the united &s;tates, is already enli|vened by manufactures. Ships, boats, oars, and hand&s;pikes, bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, &s;teel, nailrods, carriages of all kinds, hats, &s;hoes, cordage, candles, &s;oap, oils of &s;everal kinds, &s;tarch, hair powder, di&s;tilled &s;pir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, malt liquors, cabinet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, plate, puncheon packs, gunpowder, pota&s;hes, brick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, chocolate, mu&s;tard, tow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inens, &s;ail cloth, potter's ware, &s;adlery and harn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, wool and cotton cards, paper and paper hang|ings, tanned leather, books, &s;nuff, manufactured tobacco, and iron manofactures are now frequently exported to foreign countries. Coa&s;twi&s;e there is al&s;o a great trade in the&s;e and many other manufactured articles, and in raw materials and provi&s;ions for the manufacturers within the united &s;tates.</P>
<P>An argument of great importance to the &s;hipholders, exporters, and under|writers, and, indeed to the cultivators of the earth, in &s;upport of manufac|tures is to be drawn from their tendency to promote in an ea&s;y, certain, &s;afe, and cheap way, the naval capacities and &s;trength of the united &s;tates. The tran&s;portation of provi&s;ions, coal, raw materials, and other articles from the &s;outhern and middle &s;tates to the northern, and the diffu&s;ion of the manufac|tures, of the towns on the coa&s;t, throughout the union, already employs many ve&s;&s;els. The rice, indigo, cotton, hemp, flax, iron, hides, furs, tar, pitch, tur|pentine, rozin, wax, tobacco, wood and timber, flour and grain, &s;hipped from the &s;tates, on, and to the &s;outhward of the Che&s;apeak, for the manufacturers in the middle and northern &s;tates, give employment at this time to a very re&s;pecta|ble portion of our tonnage. This cannot be doubted, when it is remembered that our coa&s;ters are 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 tons, though our ve&s;&s;els in <HI>all</HI> the foreign trades pro|bably do not much exceed 150,000 tons; and the former are entirely out of the reach of foreign re&s;triction, con&s;equently (with the fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els) are our mo&s;t c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tain dependence. The weight of this circum&s;tance, will be not a little in|crea&s;ed by the recollection that the coa&s;ting trade is uncommonly intere&s;ting to a nation without tran&s;marine colonies or dominions.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the fi&s;heries as one of the modes of creating the powers of offence and defence at &s;ea, and that our agriculture and commerce, mu&s;t there|fore be &s;upported and defended by our fi&s;hermen, and fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, among other means, it will be &s;atisfactory to the cultivators, and merchants, that they will be promoted by the &s;ucce&s;s of our manufactures.

<P>It appears from this table, that in tho&s;e county towns (or &s;eats of ju&s;tice) in the interior and we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania, the nece&s;&s;ity for manufactures has occa&s;ioned a little congregation of artizans, in the proportion of twenty-&s;e|ven parts in one hundred, of the whole village in the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance, and in the proportion of thirty-&s;even parts in one hundred, in the large&s;t. The town of Wa&s;hington, which is the mo&s;t remote, and is beyond the Ohio, has been created &s;ince the late war. Its di&s;tance is about 300 miles we&s;t of Philadelphia. The variety of its manufactures is &s;triking, and it may he &s;afely affirmed, that at the &s;eats of ju&s;tice, in the counties of Delaware, Bucks, Che&s;ter, and Mont|gomery, which are neare&s;t to Philadelphia, as great a number of manufacturers, in proportion to their re&s;pective population, does not exi&s;t, though the family manufactures are more con&s;iderable in the&s;e, and though they have numerous tanneries, iron works, powder mills, paper mills, black&s;miths, hatters, &s;hoema|kers, weavers, and other valuable workmen, in their villages and &s;cattered throughout their populous town&s;hips.

<P>There is al&s;o a con&s;iderable portion of foreign trade created by the importa|tion of raw materials and other nece&s;&s;aries for the employment and con&s;ump|tion of the manufacturers: cotton hemp, bar iron, &s;heet iron, copper and bra&s;s in pigs and &s;heets, lapis calaminaris, lead, pewter, wire of every metal, woolen, cotton, and linen yarn, hempen yarns, hides, &s;kins, and furs, wool, paper for books and hangings, dyers colours, and &s;ome others, varni&s;h, print|ing types, bullion for gold and &s;ilver &s;miths, gold and &s;ilver leaf, glue, mahog+any, and other cabinet woods, mela&s;&s;es, and crude &s;ugars for di&s;tillers and re|finers, manufacturers tools and implements, &s;uch as vizes, &s;crewplates, an|vils, hammers, axes, hatchets, knives, awls, pincers, grind&s;tones, hatters bow|&s;trings, &amp;c. gla&s;s plates for looking gla&s;s makers and coach makers, callicoes and linens for printing, morocco &s;kins, and many other commodities which are expended in the work&s;hops or families of our manufacturers, including foreign articles of apparel, furniture, food, and drink.</P>

<P>SOME of the benefits to the coa&s;ting trade and other parts of the dome&s;tic commerce re&s;ulting from manufactures, have already been intimated in treating of the manufacture of liquors. Be&s;ides the&s;e, bark and hides for the tanneries, iron, lead, &s;teel, copper, hemp, flax, wool, cotton, &s;ilk, wood, timber, furs, tobacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, flax&s;eed, and gram, for the manufacturers of tho&s;e articles, and pro|vi&s;ions, fuel, indigo, and other objects of their con&s;umption and u&s;e, together with the goods made by them, are, and con&s;tantly will be purcha&s;ed, tran&s;ported from place to place, and &s;old, creating a great part of the employment for 110,000 tons of coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els, exerci&s;ing a large portion of commercial indu&s;try and &s;kill, and affording a return of profits, on a very con&s;iderable &s;um of mercantile capital, employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s. This branch of our trade is of <HI>peculiar</HI> importance; becau&s;e we have no tran&s;marine colonies, and while the redundancy of &s;hipping owned by mo&s;t nations, will leave us but little chance of materially increa&s;ing our ve&s;&s;els in the foreign trades, the exten&s;ion we may give, in the cour&s;e of ten years, to our home trade and navigation, will probably be very great. We have brought cotton, &s;ugar, and &s;altpetre, to manufacture from India, &s;ulphur from the Adriatic, hemp, flax, and iron, from Ru&s;&s;ia, copper from Sweden, furs, in|digo, and mahogany, from the gulph of Mexico, and coal for our workmen from England: and we cannot doubt, therefore, that we &s;hall tran&s;port the&s;e commodities and others, from &s;uch of the &s;tates as produce them, to tho&s;e which &s;hall create, or have already e&s;tabli&s;hed, a manufacturing demand.</P>
<P>Foreign commerce being limited by the combined value of our imports, and exports, any mercantile capital, which accumulates beyond the &s;um requi&s;ite for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, would want employment of a commercial nature, if the merchant were not able to have recour&s;e to manufactures. This is not a mere &s;peculation in po&s;&s;ible events; for con&s;iderable trading hou&s;es, and others of re&s;pectable &s;tanding, have actually entered into &s;uch pur&s;uits.

Ve&s;&s;els, which depart and return fully la|den, cannot fail to enrich their owners.</P>
<P>No arguments will be nece&s;&s;ary to convince the judicious and reflecting mind, that the employment of large capitals and of many merchants and traders is mo&s;t certain and ea&s;y, where there is the greate&s;t number and variety of objects to buy and &s;ell. As our commercial towns, therefore, have offered manufac|tured commodities to tho&s;e who come thither to trade, they have increa&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s. Pot a&s;h, pearl a&s;h, country rum, dome&s;tic liquors, loaf &s;ugar, &amp;c. have already contributed to &s;well their exports, by attracting foreign demand, or in|crea&s;ing the number of profitable objects of &s;hipment. The&s;e will naturally multiply under the hands of our manufacturers, and in&s;tead of markets, in which nothing but lumber, tobacco, &s;tock, provi&s;ions, and raw materials were for|merly to be obtained, our &s;eaports will be converted into magazines, in which all tho&s;e articles will be purcha&s;eable, and the various commodities manufac|tured from them. For the&s;e goods in whatever &s;hape, purcha&s;ers will never be wanting: <HI>cheap merchandi&s;e as certainly attracts buyers, as water finds its level.</HI> Nor is this mere &s;anguine hope, or ingenious &s;ugge&s;tion; for it is an obvious truth, that the greate&s;t manufacturing nations in the old world, are the greate&s;t traders to foreign parts. Holland, when mo&s;t remarkable for manufac|tures, traded to the amount of eighty millions of dollars per annum in the commodities of other countries.</P>
<P><HI>A few general reflexions on American manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>The political concord and attachments, which grow out of mutual benefits, are the mo&s;t rational and permanent. In this view, the cement, which will be given to the national union, by the interchanges of raw materials, provi&s;ions, fuel, and manufactures among the &s;everal &s;tates, is of ine&s;timable value. If European nations have &s;hown di&s;po&s;itions of amity and mutual forbearance, on the&s;e con&s;iderations, it cannot be doubted that &s;i&s;ter &s;tates will evince equal wi&s;dom and virtue. If many parts of our union, from policy or tem|porary nece&s;&s;ity for manufactured &s;upplies, have been willing to exhibit the greate&s;t liberality towards tho&s;e foreigners, with whom they have been recently at the wide&s;t variance, it mu&s;t appear very de&s;irable, that the capacity at once to accommodate them and engage their regard, &s;hould be transferred from di&s;tant &s;trangers, to their own continent, and their own kindred. If the merchants and manufacturers of the opulent nation with whom the united &s;tates &s;o long waged war, influenced by the hope of our con&s;umption, cried aloud for peace, and, on the moment of its return, pre&s;&s;ed with all the cour|te&s;ies of commerce to our &s;hores, the exi&s;ting friend&s;hip of the &s;everal parts of the union for each other mu&s;t be &s;trengthened by &s;imilar influences, as they &s;hall be progre&s;&s;ively created.</P>
<P>The animated pro&s;ecution and liberal encouragement of manufactures, is at this moment a great political duty. The national legi&s;lature has increa&s;ed the impo&s;t on foreign merchandi&s;e, to defray the expen&s;es of the Indian war. The continuance of a great part of the duties is to be no longer than that of the ho&s;tilities which occa&s;ioned them to be laid. If the interval &s;hould be dili|gently employed in the promotion of manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctures, which the&s;e duties are calculated to create and to protect, the temporary injuries of the Indian war will be accompanied and followed by great &s;olid, and permanent benefits. The military expen&s;e is rendered le&s;s burden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eme, by the employment given to our

The &s;hoes, boots, hor&s;emen's caps, hats, buckles, buttons, &s;adlery, &s;pears, rifles, gunpowder, and other articles for the u&s;e of the army, are made by American manufacturers. It is perceived, that war, which often interrupts foreign commerce and generally dimini&s;hes the prices of agricultu|ral productions for exportation, has in this in&s;tance no effects of that nature; but by judicious arrangements, may be rendered in&s;trumental to the greate&s;t &s;upport of the landed intere&s;t&mdash;<HI>the national manufactures.</HI> The lamentable ha|voc of the field mu&s;t inevitably dimini&s;h the number of our cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zens; but there is every rea&s;on to beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, that tho&s;e, who, in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent war, may fall under the banners of their country, will prove inferior in number to tho&s;e who will be drawn, by the influence of the new duties, from foreign countries, to the &s;tandard of American manufactures: and although the mo&s;t u&s;eful arts are no compen&s;ation for the lives of our compatriots, the acqui&s;ition of a greater number of new citizens will counterbalance the <HI>political evil</HI> re|&s;ulting from &s;uch a lo&s;s, &s;o far as it may unhappily occur.</P>
<P>It is detrimental to the united &s;tates that the manufactures they con&s;ume are drawn from nations who&s;e citizens pay much greater contributions to their government than our manufacturers, and con&s;equently that we &s;o far forth are &s;ubject to their taxes, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es. In Great Britain, for example, their national taxes are &s;even times as large as ours, in proportion to the numbers of people in the two countries; and their poor rates and church rate are <HI>each</HI> more than double our whole national contributions. The monopolies of tho&s;e countries fall heavily upon the con&s;umers, among their citizens; and tho&s;e, who purcha&s;e their fabries, bear a part of this burden, which lies on their manufacturers. The commercial charges paid by the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India company <HI>abroad,</HI> amount to one million of dollars per annum; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght and charges in England are about two millions and two thirds more, exclu|&s;ively of duties. The company's civil and military charges would, in two years like the pre&s;ent, pay all the expen&s;es of our government, and di&s;charge our national debt. The re&s;trictions on navigation and trade in the European nations al&s;o enhance the price of raw materials and articles of con&s;umption required by their manufacturers, all which falls ultimately upon the people of the united &s;tates, &s;o far as their fabries are con&s;umed here. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e con&s;idera|tions &s;hould induce our mo&s;t &s;trenuous exertions, to dimini&s;h tho&s;e indirect burdens, and at the &s;ame time they hold out &s;trong promi&s;es of a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to our efforts.</P>
<P>In taking a view of the aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irs of the united &s;tates, and comparing them with the &s;ituation of mo&s;t of the great commercial nations of Europe, the mind is immediately impre&s;&s;ed with the peculiarity of their being without tran&s;marine colonies. Though &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culative politicians have entertained doubts in regard to favourable effects from &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, taking into view the ex|pen&s;es of their improvement, defence, and government, no que&s;tion has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n made but that the monopoly of their trade greatly increa&s;es the commerce of the nations to which they are appertenant. Of &s;uch an advantage the united &s;tates do not enjoy the benefit; and con&s;idering this circum&s;tance, and the prevailing di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;trict their commerce, the fi&s;heries, the coa&s;ting trade, and <HI>manufactures</HI> appear to merit extraordinary attention.</P>

<P>The pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject will be terminated by remarking, that although this great &s;ubdivi&s;ion of our political economy has been copi|ou&s;ly and freely treated in every mode, it has not only pre&s;erved its origi|nal importance in the public judgment, but has ri&s;en in the e&s;timation of the people in every part of the union&mdash;<HI>a fate that rarely attends unimportant truths or dangerous errors in an enlightened country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Concerning the imports of the united &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P>This part of the national bu&s;ine&s;s has given ri&s;e to doubts, whether the united &s;tates are really in a pro&s;perous &s;ituation. The apprehen&s;ion is believed, howe|ver, to have proceeded from &s;everal errors. The e&s;timation of the imports has probably been made at the prices current in America, which is more than the united &s;tates pay for them, by the total value of the following particulars. 1&s;t, Such part of the &s;hipping charges abroad, as accrue to the benefit of the citi|zens of the united &s;tates, who may be on the &s;pot to make the &s;hipment: 2dly, that part of the freight upon them, which is paid to our own ve&s;&s;els: 3dly, that part of the premium of in&s;urance upon them, which is paid to American un|derwriters or in&s;urers: 4thly, the whole amount of the duties, and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;ees, on the goods, which amount to &s;everal millions of dollars. 5thly, the amount of the tonnage and fees on foreign ve&s;&s;els, which are deductions in &s;a|vour of the country, from the value of the goods imported in them: 6thly, the porterage, &s;torage, cooperage, weighing, guaging, mea&s;uring, commi&s;&s;ions on &s;ales here and other incidental expen&s;es on that part of the imports which be|longs to foreigners: 7thly, the profits of our merchants on that part of the im|ports which belongs to them: 8thly, the wa&s;teage of goods belonging to for|eigners between their arrival or time of valuation and the time of &s;ale: 9thly the benefit of credit, which is not le&s;s than two and an half per cent. on the whole value of our imports: and 10thly, the value of tho&s;e importal goods which remain in the country, being the property of per&s;ons intending to become, or who will ultimately become citizens of the united &s;tates. But the apparent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conjectural di&s;proportion between the exports and imports of the united &s;tates, will be con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the &s;ales of ve&s;&s;els to foreigners at home and abroad&mdash;the &s;ales of lands to them&mdash;the expen&s;es of foreigners here &mdash;the expen&s;es of foreign ve&s;&s;els here, and the co&s;t of their &s;ea &s;tores&mdash;the com|mi&s;&s;ions on the &s;hipments of their cargoes, and on the di&s;bur&s;ement of their ve&s;&s;els, as already ob&s;erved in treating of our exports. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the freight of goods &s;hips to foreign countries in our own ve&s;&s;els, (not le&s;s, probably, than three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ns o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dollars) and the profits upon all the goods exported on the accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our own citizens, contribute very much to increa&s;e the fund, where|with ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imports are purcha&s;ed or paid for.

<P>An opinion &s;omewhat &s;ingular and of con&s;iderable importance will be hazard|ed upon this &s;ubject. <HI>The united &s;tates, to make the utmo&s;t advantage of things in their pre&s;ent improveable &s;ituation, &s;hould have little or no balance in their fa|vour on their general commerce.</HI> If their exports, outward freights, &s;ales of ve&s;|&s;els and lands, &amp;c. amount to twenty-four millions of dollars per annum, they will find their true intere&s;t in importing the whole value in well-&s;elected com|modities. It is better, for example, that they import mela&s;&s;es, hemp, cotton, wool, bar iron, hides, &s;kins, furs, &s;altpetre, &s;ulphur, copper, tin, bra&s;s, paper, mahogany, &amp;c. to manufacture; tools for artizans, and materials and uten&s;ils for con&s;tructing works, improving wa&s;te lands, and cultivating farms, and breeding cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep; than that they &s;hould bring back the equivalent in gold or &s;ilver. The &s;um we annually import in articles of that nature, more precious to us than the mo&s;t precious metals, would con&s;titute an immen&s;e balance in our favour: &s;uch, indeed, as would, in a few years, oppre&s;s our country with too copious a circulating medium, or compel us to export it.</P>
<P>That the exports and other means of paying for our imports are much more adequate to the occa&s;ion, than they were during &s;everal years &s;ub&s;equent to the peace, is manife&s;t from the &s;tate of our private credit in Europe.</P>
<P>A di&s;tinction, and, it is conceived, a very important one, has been already intimated in favour of &s;uch of our imports as are of a nature adapted to en|lance the value of our lands, or to employ or a&s;&s;i&s;t our citizens: and in regard to tho&s;e which are for immediate con&s;umption, the quantity cannot be in pro|portion to our former imports, con&s;idering the increa&s;e of population. We have almo&s;t ab&s;olutely cea&s;ed to import &s;hoes, boots, &s;adlery, coar&s;e hats, plate, &s;nuff, manufactured tobacco, cabinet wares, carriages, wool and cotton cards, hanging paper, gunpowder, and other articles; and we have exceedingly di|mini&s;hed our impertation of coar&s;e linen and woolen goods, cordage, copper uten|&s;ils, tin uten&s;ils, malt liquors, loaf &s;ugar, &s;teel, paper, playing cards, glue, wa&s;ers, fine hats, braziery, watches and clocks, chee&s;e, &amp;c: and we either make the&s;e articles from native productions, by which the whole value is &s;truck off from our imports, or we manufacture them of foreign raw materials, which co&s;t lo&s;s than the goods u&s;ed to do, e&s;pecially as they often yield a great freight to our own ve&s;&s;els. Thus the freight of the mela&s;&s;es to make rum, imported in one year, at two dollars per hhd. was not le&s;s than 140,000 dollars. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation occurs as to hemp, cotton, iron, copper, bra&s;s, tin, &s;altpetre, &s;ulphur, mahogany, hides, dye woods, and other raw materials.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tantial evidences, there would appear to be little danger of mi&s;take, in concluding, that our imports, on a medium of two or three years, have not been di&s;proportionate to our exports, and other &s;afe and regular means of balancing the amount of our &s;upplies. But though the documents for a compari&s;on between the pre&s;ent imports, and tho&s;e antecedent to the revolu|tion, are le&s;s perfect than is to be de&s;ired, &s;ome which offer are worthy of atten|tion. Our imports from Great Britain in 1770, making &s;ome addition for tho&s;e from Ireland and adding 20 per cent. to bring them to their market value, were worth <HI>here</HI> above &pound;. 2,400,000 &s;terling. In this item, the information ob|tained from a report of the lords of the Briti&s;h privy council, is principally re|lied on, though a part of it is &s;upplementary e&s;timation. To this &s;um is to be added, a proportion of the imports into all the American colonies in 1770, from all the re&s;t of the would but Great Britain, which, after deducting therefrom &pound;. 73,000 &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l. for the value imported into Bermuda, the Bahamas, the northern Briti&s;h colonies, and Newfoundland, leaves &pound;. 1,050,000 &s;terling, at the value here. The total value
<PB N="22" REF="024230_0021_0FC57E53ABEDF4D8">of our imports in 1770, would then appear to have been more than &pound;. 3,450,000 or about 15,000,000 dollars, as they would have &s;old in the American market; exclu&s;ive of the contraband trade, which was con&s;iderable. This will be &s;een by a reference to the fir&s;t number of the&s;e reflexions, to be full &s;even millions of dollars more than our exports at the &s;ame time. If then our imports were to bear the &s;ame proportion to 18,250,000 dollars (our pre&s;ent exports) the form|er might be above 34,000,000 dollars, without creating more alarm than we had then rea&s;on to feel. This view of the &s;ubject may convince us, that our im|ports were too copious, at lea&s;t in &s;ome quarters, for &s;everal years before the war; and hence we find a heavy load of private debt was created and remains upon the citizens of &s;ome of the &s;tates at this day. Happily for the united &s;tates, the reduction of the priers of &s;upplies, by the pre&s;ent freedom of their com|merce, by the agency of &s;kilful merchants in&s;tead of planters inexperienced in trade, by the introduction of machinery in Europe, and by their own manufac|turing indu&s;try, has kept down their imports many millions of dollars below that &s;um, although the import and tonnage have directly or indirectly contribu|ted to enhance the nominal amount, without increa&s;ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um to be paid for them abroad.</P>
<P><HI>A &s;ketch of the general trade of the united &s;tates.</HI></P>
<P>In taking a &s;urvey of the American commerce, the attention is plea&s;ingly at|tracted to the increa&s;e of &s;hip-building, the new manufactories of articles ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the equipment of ve&s;&s;els, and the improvement in the art of &s;hip|building, as well as the &s;uperior quality of the materials now u&s;ed in their con&s;truction. The large&s;t number of ve&s;&s;els built in any one year before the late war, as far as it can be a&s;certained, was equal to 24,358 tons; and at lea&s;t 32,000 tons of &s;uperior quality were built in 1791. The timber and plark are more cho&s;en, and iron is more copiou&s;ly u&s;ed at this time, becau&s;e the ve&s;&s;els are not intended for &s;ale, and the &s;en&s;ible practice of &s;alting them, is becoming very frequent. It is important, too, that the art of &s;hip-building is diffu&s;ed more generally than any other equally important one, which is carried on within the united &s;tates.</P>
<P>The export trade in our produce is more beneficial than heretofore to the landed intere&s;t, becau&s;e the cultivators do not, as formerly, anticipate upon their crops abroad, by ordering out &s;upplies at the di&s;cretion of the European merchant; to be paid for in &s;hipments of their crops upon their own account and ri&s;que. The pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs in Maryland and Virginia, particularly the tobacco planters, &s;uffered extremely from an incon&s;iderate pur&s;uit of that practice before the re&s;olution. The American merchant is now more frequently their importer; and as he under&s;tands the mode of procuring goods cheap, the real profits of the import and export trade of the country, are in a greater degree divided be|tween the planter and the trader.</P>
<P>The reduction of the prices of Ea&s;t India and China goods, of every &s;pe|cies of manufactures in which labour &s;aving machmery and &s;light apply, and of wines, occa&s;ion our imports to be obtained on more favourable terms. This beneficial effect is increa&s;ed by the freedom of our import trade, which lets in the productions and manufactures of all countries by a direct intercour&s;e with them, which was formerly forbidden. From the &s;ame cau&s;e, &s;uperior prices for our produce and manufactured artic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s have been obtained. If tobacco is be|coming an exception, it is to be remembered, that great prices were obtained for it till lately, and that the extraordinary quantity rai&s;ed is &s;ufficient to account for its f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</P>
<P>The coa&s;ting trade has become very great, and the derangement of the We&s;t India trade mu&s;t extend it exceedingly, during the current year, from the failure of mela&s;&s;es. The increa&s;e of manufactures, and foreign re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ctions
<PB N="23" REF="024230_0022_0FC57E56520CAE88">on other branches, have contributed to elevate this valuable part of our com|merce; and the former (manufactures) will continue &s;teadily to increa&s;e its importance. The ve&s;&s;els, which take &s;upplies of flour, and many other arti|cles from the middle and northern &s;tates to South Carolina and Georgia, make very frequent voyages, and they return lets than half laden: but if the planters &s;hould pur&s;ue the cultivation of hemp, flax, hops, and cotton, they may come trick with full cargoes. A &s;imilar remark may be ju&s;tly made in regard to other &s;tates.</P>
<P>The fi&s;heries do not appear to have recovered their former value; but it is plain, they have increa&s;ed yearly &s;ince 1789: and they are even now more valuable than they appear to be. The con&s;umption of oil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">debone, &s;kins of &s;ea animals, &s;permaceti, and pickled and dried fi&s;h, is much greater in the united &s;tates at this time, than it was twenty years ago. The outfits of the fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, too, are more from the indu&s;try and re&s;ources of the country than was formerly the ca&s;e. Wherefore the general benefits re&s;ulting from the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;heries, are probably little le&s;s than before the revolution.</P>
<P>Remote as the united &s;tates are from all foreign nations, totally unconnected with their po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itics, and having no temptation to wage war for territory, they cannot but advance in commercial and agricultural pro&s;perity, if they pre&s;erve <HI>order</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> at home. Foreign re&s;trictions will be nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s rigid, as occa&s;ions for &s;upplies and pacific &s;ervices from the united &s;tates &s;hall ari&s;e: and the&s;e occa&s;ions mu&s;t inevitably exi&s;t in every maritime nation, which &s;hall en|gage in war, even with a country, which is not it&s;elf maritime.</P>
<P>The profecution of manufactures has created &s;ome increa&s;e of our foreign trade, and will extend it. If we did not pur&s;ue that branch of indu&s;try, we &s;hould not import copper, iron, and hemp, from the Baltic; cotton, &s;altpetre, and white callicoes from India; and cocoa, dye-woods, mahogany, cotton, and hides from the We&s;t Indies, and the &s;outhern parts of the American continent. Some of the&s;e importations are regularly and exten&s;ively made; others are in|crea&s;ing. Without them we &s;hould have no intercour&s;e with &s;ome of the&s;e coun|tries, and much le&s;s than we now have with others. In like manner, our in|tercour&s;e with reveral countries is increa&s;ed by manufactured exports. The demand for our pota&s;h, di&s;tilled &s;pirits, &s;hips and boats, &s;teel, malt liquors, chee&s;e, bar iron, &s;lit iron, &s;teel, gunpowder, carriages, and other articles, occa|&s;ions a greater and more beneficial trade with many foreign ports. It is impo&s;|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how rapid and how con&s;iderable the progre&s;s of this part of our commerce will be. The exported manufactures of Great Britain, in 1791, were greater than tho&s;e of fifty years ago, by twice the value of our pre&s;ent ex|ports.</P>
<P>It is extremely favourable to American commerce, internal and foreign, that a variety of changes have taken place in the affairs of the would, which have opened branches of trade formerly withhold from us by monopoly, or other circum&s;tances. The act of &s;eparation from Great Britain enabled us to trade to China, Bombay, and Surat; and the enterpri&s;e of our citizens &s;oon di&s;covered the way.

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>NUMBER IV.</HI> Concerning the banks e&s;tabli&s;hed in the united &s;tates.</HEAD>
<P>THESE valuable in&s;titutions were unknown to us before the re|volution, being added to the political economy in the latter part of the war. The paper emi&s;&s;ions in the times of the provinces, had yielded &s;ome of the advantages of bank notes, though with le&s;s &s;afety to tho&s;e who received them. But the degree in which they were unavoidably recurred to, in the cour&s;e of the war, had com|pletely de&s;troyed the utility of paper money in 1781. The &s;tate of public credit, and indeed of the public affairs in general, as well as the exigencies of the cultivators, merchants, and manufacturers, required an efficient &s;ub&s;titute for an in&s;trument of negociation and dealing, of &s;o great compa&s;s. The &s;cheme of a bank pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the manner, which is univer&s;ally known, as the mo&s;t probable mean of accommodating the general nece&s;&s;ities, political, agricultu|ral, and commercial. The promi&s;es, which the plan made, were abundantly fulfilled; and at the &s;ame time a &s;tandard of public con|duct and action in regard to the rights of property, was unob&s;ervedly erected, at a moment when the recent cour&s;e of events had render|ed it very de&s;irable, as well from political as moral con&s;iderations. It has been found, accordingly, that the laws which concern pro|perty, in the places where banks have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, have quick|ly acquired a &s;tability, if they were good, and have meliorated, if they were before exceptionable, notwith&s;tanding any &s;uppo&s;ed or real errors in the plans or admini&s;tration of the in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>In re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ecting upon the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, one cannot but call to mind a &s;ugge&s;tion, which frequently occurs, that too large a por|tion of the capital of the united &s;tates, has been applied to them. Few pecuniary operations are of as much importance. In e&s;timat|ing the extent to which we might have gone with prudence, an ex|amination of the &s;tate of that bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;ucce&s;sful and at the &s;ame time the be&s;t known &s;cene of trade in Europe, may be of &s;ome u&s;e. In the city of London, the bank of <HI>England</HI> (exclu&s;ively of that of Scotland) has operated with a capital of more than fifty millions of dollars about forty-&s;ix years. The population of <HI>England,</HI> on a medium, during that term, has been le&s;s than double that of the united &s;tates at pre&s;ent, yet the capital of its bank has been above five times the capital of our national bank, and near five times the a|mount of all the &s;ub&s;criptions which are yet paid into all the banks in the united &s;tates. There are, moreover, a great number of private banks in the &s;ame city, probably not le&s;s than &s;ixty in number, &s;ome of which have more capital &s;tock, than any bank in this coun|try, except that of the united &s;tates. The aggregate amount of their capitals is probably equal to that of the bank of England. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are very many con&s;iderable private banks &s;cat|tered through the kingdom. In addition to the&s;e, there are the public and the private banks of Scotland. If the banks of England
<PB N="26" REF="024230_0025_0FC57E5F4A1C0B10">and Scotland, public and private, out of London, be equal to the private banks of London alone, then the capital of tho&s;e in&s;titu|tions in Great Britain, will be 150,000,000 dollars, or above fourteen times as many dollars as there are per&s;ons in that kingdom, though the whole of the &s;tocks of the banks in the united &s;tates, which are paid in, are not equal to three times the number of their inhabi|tants. Again. If the banks of Great Britain be mea&s;ured by the exports of that i&s;land, it will be found, that the latter, at their highe&s;t value (ninety millions of dollars) are only three fifths of their aggregate bank capital, and that our exports, at 18,250,000 dollars, are above two thirds more than all our bank capital, which is actually paid in. Taking the Briti&s;h imports at 80,000,000 of dollars, and tho&s;e of the united &s;tates at 24,000,000, the compari&s;on will be &s;till more in favour of the di&s;cretion, which has been ob&s;er|ved in the united &s;tates. But a very important mea&s;ure of the&s;e in|&s;titutions yet remains to be applied, by which prudent men will be di&s;po&s;ed to te&s;t the &s;ubject&mdash;<HI>the quantity of &s;pecie.</HI> The bank capital of Great Britain being, as above &s;tated, about 150 millions of dol|lars, and the quantum of &s;pecie being never e&s;timated at more than 22,000,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, or 97,700,000 dollars, the aggregate bank ca|pitals of the united &s;tates, as now paid in (ten and one half millions of dollars) would be as prudently, and &s;olidly founded on a quantity of &s;pecie a little le&s;s than &s;even millions of dollars. Al|though it would be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the preci&s;e amount of the &s;pecie of the united &s;tates, e&s;timates carefully made, appear to war|rant a belief, that it is equal to that &s;um. But while examinations like the&s;e &s;eem to abate and even entirely to de&s;troy, the apprehen|&s;ion that we may have pur&s;ued the bu&s;ine&s;s of banking to the injury of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, &s;ome circum&s;tances of a prudential nature are not to be overlooked. When forming the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, we may commit errors, perhaps, in carrying into one &s;cene too great a proportion of the capital appropriated to their creation. Hence the &s;ound policy of &s;ubtracting from the ma&s;s of the bank of the united &s;tates, to e&s;tabli&s;h branches at New-York, Bo&s;ton, Baltimore, Charle&s;ton and (as is &s;aid to be intended) in Vir|ginia, mini&s;tering to the convenience, the nece&s;&s;ities, and the in|tere&s;ts of government, the planter, the farmer, the merchant, the navigator, the fi&s;herman, the &s;hipbuilder, the manufacturer and the mechanic, in &s;ix &s;everal and variant &s;cenes, in&s;tead of accumu|lating in one great ma&s;s, a &s;uperabundant capital&mdash;A political magnet attracting through devious cour&s;es and attaching all things to its own vicinity.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible to err, too, in the di&s;po&s;ition of banking e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, by &s;uperadding to tho&s;e which already accommodate a par|ticular &s;cene, rather than introducing the new in&s;titutions into places hitherto without them. The united &s;tates contain five or &s;ix great local &s;ubdivi&s;ions of trade, re&s;ulting principally from the im|perious dictates of <HI>the nature of things.</HI> In mo&s;t of tho&s;e great &s;pheres, there is more than one con&s;iderable and flouri&s;hing trading town, though there is in each, one which has an acknowledged pre-emi|nence. When a rea&s;onable portion of bank capital has been intro|duced into one of the&s;e commercial <HI>metropoles,</HI> the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new bank would &s;eem to be mo&s;t expedient in the trading town of the next degree of con&s;ideration. It is true, that &s;o far as the operation
<PB N="27" REF="024230_0026_0FC57E61422C9460">is an employment, or application of the property of individuals, it mu&s;t be left, (within the laws) to their own will; but as the act of in|corporation places the &s;ubject within the power of the legi&s;latures, and within the &s;phere of their cares and duties, &s;o it is highly im|portant that the&s;e in&s;titutions be modified in their original formation, upon prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciples of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, in regard to the rea&s;onable accommodation of the marts of commerce within their &s;phere of le|gi&s;lation, and of all the landed citizens, who re&s;ort to them for the &s;ales of their &s;urplus produce, or the purcha&s;e of their &s;upplies.</P>
<P>A precious con&s;equence has re&s;ulted from the di&s;tribution of banks through different parts of the united &s;tates. Like all great objects, the&s;e in&s;titutions, while operating very beneficially in re|gard to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a country, are liable to be rendered in&s;tru|mental to local party views. Being committed, as in the united &s;tates, to ten &s;everal boards of directors, &s;elected for the &s;ervice on account of their property, integrity, talents, and attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and who&s;e primary duties are the legal, di&s;creet, and beneficial ex|ecution of their tru&s;t, it is not probable, nor, indeed, is it in their power, to deviate from their proper walk, into the ground of po|litical combination and intrigue.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance ob&s;ervable in the bank of the united &s;tates, will not fail to attract the at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of cautious men. The portion of public debt, which enters into the compo&s;ition of their &s;tock, is the particular contemplated. In this re&s;pect, the bank of England, and the bank of Ireland (which are among the be&s;t accredited of tho&s;e in&s;titutions in Europe) exceed that of the united &s;tates in the proportion of one third. It is very favourable to our in&s;ti|tution, that the national debt, and ordinary and extraordinary expen&s;es of both Great Britain and Ireland are much greater in pro|portion to wealth and numbers, than tho&s;e of the united &s;tates, and that our government is not le&s;s free from error, nor more like to be di&s;turbed than theirs. It cannot, therefore, be more un&s;afe to con|&s;ide in our in&s;titution, which contains three fourths, than in theirs which is wholly compo&s;ed of public debt. It is, moreover, true, and worthy of ob&s;ervation, that mo&s;t of the other banks in the united &s;tates (and particularly the three large&s;t) have voluntarily and by their own operations placed con&s;iderable portions of their &s;tock up|on the credit of the united &s;tates, by purcha&s;ing largely of the public debt, and by giving at this time exten&s;ive credits founded upon its &s;ecurity. The market value of the public debt, which is generally greater in &s;pecie than its nominal amount, renders that part of the bank &s;tock, which is compo&s;ed of it, intrin&s;ically more valuable than that which is in coin.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning the national indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>An enquiry into the knowledge or &s;kill, a&s;&s;iduity, economy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> frugality, and good management with which the &s;everal de&s;criptions of citizens in the united &s;tates pur&s;ue their employments, has never been made. The &s;ubject is copious, and would require much previ|ous enquiry and detail. It is not intended, therefore, in this place to attempt a developement of it: yet it may be &s;erviceable to be|&s;tow upon it a few brief reflexions. The learned profe&s;&s;ions will not be brought into view, as they are not &s;trictly of the nature of
<PB N="28" REF="024230_0027_0FC57E62A54D2DD8">the object contemplated. The planters, the farmers, the merchants, the navigators, the fi&s;hermen, the &s;hipbuilders, the manufacturers and the mechanic, with the per&s;ons immediately employed by them, are all which are conceived to be comprehended in the &s;ubject. The body of the planters, that is, tho&s;e who cultivate tobacco, rice, indigo, and cotton, are, as a general de&s;cription of cultivators, the be&s;t inform|ed in regard to the object of their particular pur&s;uit, though it is manife&s;t that they have abundant matter for increa&s;ed attention in perfecting their cultivation, in a&s;certaining tho&s;e &s;pecies of their va|luable plants, which are mo&s;t excellent, mo&s;t certain, and mo&s;t pro|ductive, in the improvement of their implements of hu&s;bandry, in the acqui&s;ition of auxiliary implements and machinery, in perfect|ing the modes of curing their produce, and preparing it for market and particularly in the attainment of an adequate &s;ub&s;titute for the ordinary &s;pecies of labourers, a &s;upply of which has become precari|ous. It appears to be worth their con&s;idering, too, as well with an eye to profit, as humanity, whether an advantageous variation in the employment of &s;ome of the blacks might not be made, by introduc|ing upon every e&s;tate &s;ome of the &s;impler manufactures to employ children, old and invalid per&s;ons of both &s;exes, and particularly the females during that term when two lives depend upon their health.</P>
<P>The merchants, navigators, fi&s;hermen, and &s;hipbuilders of the united &s;tates may be &s;afely affirmed to be four de&s;criptions of our citizens, who&s;e indu&s;try is as uniformly energetic and well directed, as tho&s;e of any country in the world, though it is certain that a much &s;tricter economy prevails among per&s;ons of &s;ome foreign na|tions engaged in tho&s;e pur&s;uits&mdash;an example demanding &s;erious at|tention.</P>
<P>The manufacturers in &s;ome branches pur&s;ue their occupations under the di&s;advantages of very few errors; yet tho&s;e citizens would be &s;en&s;ibly benefited, were they able to relieve them&s;elves of certain parts of their labour by the attainment of the auxiliary machinery, which are the purcha&s;e of larger capitals than are yet engaged in their line. Circum&s;tances, however, of various kinds are daily contributing to remove this inconvenience. The bulk of the manufacturers do not want indu&s;try, nor &s;kill enough to &s;ucceed in tho&s;e &s;imple manufactures, to which it is mo&s;t their intere&s;t to ap|ply them&s;elves. It may be rather &s;aid, that they manufacture ordi|nary kinds of fabries, from the nature of the demand, than that they manufacture badly. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is, moreover, progre&s;&s;ively advancing, and has felt, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, &s;ome of them recent, the fo&s;tering hand of goverument.</P>
<P>The mechanic branches have been, till this time, on nearly as good a footing; but tho&s;e employed in the erection of buildings ought now to &s;eek the and of &s;uch parts of &s;cience as have relation to their calling. Architecture has been little &s;tudied. It ought not to be forgotten, that a competent knowledge of it is no le&s;s conducive to economy and convenience, than to elegance and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important of all the employments of our citizens, that of <HI>the farmer,</HI> remains to be noticed. It is very much to be feared, that in point of execution, a candid examination would prove that
<PB N="29" REF="024230_0028_0FC57E652E0DF678">this be&s;t of pur&s;uits is mo&s;t imperfectly conducted. The proofs are, innumerable in&s;tances of impoveri&s;hed lands, bodies of mea|dow lands, in the old &s;ettlements, which remain in a &s;tate of nature, an almo&s;t univer&s;al inattention to the making or pre&s;erving of ma|nure, the frequent inattention to the condition of the feed grain, evidenced by the growth of inferior grain in fields of wheat, and by the complexion of the flour in &s;ome quarters, the bad condition of barns, &s;tables and fences, and in &s;ome places the total want of the former, the deficiency of &s;pring-hou&s;es or other cool dairies in exten&s;ive tracts of country, the want, or a trifling &s;tock of bees, the frequent want of orchards, and the neglect of tho&s;e which have been planted by preceding occupants, the neglect of the &s;ugar tree, the neglect of fallen timber and fuel, accompanied with the wanton felling of timber trees for fuel, the neglect of hou&s;ehold manufactures in many families, the neglect of making pot-a&s;h, the non-u&s;e of oxen, and above all, the growth in &s;ub&s;tance, of large bodies of farmers on lands of ordinary quality, while the inhabi|tants of exten&s;ive &s;cenes, hardly extract from much &s;uperior lands, a mi&s;erable &s;u&s;tenance and more mi&s;erable clothing.</P>
<P>It is a fact very painful to ob&s;erve, and unplea&s;ant to repre&s;ent, but it is indubitably true, that <HI>farming</HI> in the grain &s;tates, their great be&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, the employment mo&s;t precious in free govern|ments, is, too generally &s;peaking, the lea&s;t under&s;tood, or the lea&s;t economically and attentively pur&s;ued, of any of the occupa|tions which engage the citizens of the united &s;tates. It is acknow|ledged, however, with &s;atisfaction, that great changes have been lately made, and that the energy, &s;pirit of improvement, and eco|nomy, which have been recently di&s;played, promi&s;e the regular and rapid melioration of the agricultural &s;y&s;tem. All other things have taken a cour&s;e of great improvement&mdash;and it cannot be apprehend|ed that the yeomanry of the united &s;tates will permit them&s;elves to be excelled by any of their brethren, in the mo&s;t precious cha|racteri&s;tic of a good citizen&mdash;<HI>u&s;efulne&s;s in their proper &s;phere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Concerning the laws which intrench upon the rights of property.</HI></P>
<P>It is not remembered that the acts of the national legi&s;lature have been deemed by any of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of any de&s;cription of property, unfavourable to their rights, except the proceedings in regard to the public debt. It is no le&s;s curious than true, that a part of the community affirm that the government have injured the country by too much liberality, while another part charge the legi&s;lature with impairing the contract.</P>
<P>In taking a view of this &s;ubject, it &s;hould be remembered, that the &s;tate of things when it was taken up, was in every re&s;pect critical and uncertain. It was difficult to &s;ay what the country could perform, and more &s;o to tell what they would comply with. It was perceived, on the one hand, that as &s;uch a &s;tate of <HI>public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> as preceded the year 1789, would ruin a government more energetic than that of the united &s;tates, &s;o its immediate melioration was a matter of the mo&s;t imperious nece&s;&s;ity. On the other hand, the non-exi&s;tence of one &s;ingle efficient funding &s;y&s;tem, <HI>yielding a full &s;pecie intere&s;t,</HI> in any one &s;tate, and a number of painful facts in the financial operations of &s;ome of the legi&s;latures, created a conviction, that there was either an inability or di&s;inclination in all to render a &s;pecie pay|ment
<PB N="30" REF="024230_0029_0FC57E682A689910">in the full extent of the <HI>explicit</HI> contracts. Some of the con|tracts were found not to be explicit containing promi&s;es of large &s;ums under the name &s;pecie, which it could not have been the expectation of the government at their date to di&s;charge, or of the creditor to receive in coin; becau&s;e they promi&s;ed to pay as &s;pe|cie, what was notoriou&s;ly much le&s;s valuable than contracts previ|ou&s;ly liquidated at forty nominal dollars for one in coin. The claims of the original creditors al&s;o were &s;trongly repre&s;ented, while the conduct of every &s;tate in the union, in its particular finances, had di&s;countenanced a di&s;crimination in their favour; and the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of property were urged again&s;t a reduction of the owners prin|cipal: que&s;tions were al&s;o rai&s;ed about the original intrin&s;ic value of the money and property received by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nired &s;tates, leading to the devi&s;ing of a new &s;cale of depreciation. By infu&s;ing into the propo&s;i|tions for a &s;ettlement of the debt, two qualities&mdash;<HI>a reduction of the intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>a temporary irredeemability of the principal,</HI> which have co&s;t the debtor nothing, and the creditor very little; by vigerous and well devi&s;ed efforts to recover credit at home and abroad, an arrange|ment was formed, and executed, which has given better payment to the creditor than could rea&s;onably have been hoped. It is plain to every ob&s;erver, that, but for the indi&s;cretions of &s;ome of the pub|lic creditors, who &s;uperadded to the trials and fluctuations of a convale&s;cent &s;tate of credit the late unparalleled difficulties of the holders of the &s;tock, the three &s;pecies of the public poper, taken at a medium, would have been worth the nominal value in the market. <HI>Hitherto it never has been.</HI></P>
<P>There yet remain, however, in the united &s;tates &s;ome laws which affect the rights of property. The operation of in&s;talment and va|luation laws is not terminated in two or three of the &s;tates. In two or three others, paper money is a tender in all or in particular ca&s;es. In &s;ome quarters, real e&s;tate is protected from execution for debt; and in others, the judgments of the courts are &s;u&s;pended, if the income of the e&s;tate bears a certain proportion to the credi|tors' demand. In &s;ome of the &s;tates, preferences are given to the claims of citizens, before tho&s;e of citizens of the other &s;tates, or of foreigners; and a variety of ill exi&s;ts in many quarters, in the form of in&s;olvent laws. The &s;ederal con&s;titution, and tho&s;e of &s;e|veral of the &s;tates, have barred the introduction of the&s;e evils in regard to new tran&s;actions; and the &s;tates which are not chargea|ble with them, in regard to pa&s;t affairs, have reaped, in the la&s;t three years an ample reward for their wi&s;dom and virtue. Proper|ty may almo&s;t be called <HI>the palladium of communities.</HI> Their <HI>moral</HI> &s;afety at lea&s;t is always at hazard, when that is unwarrantably in|vaded. In every ca&s;e wherein difficulties to obtain his own are in|terpo&s;ed in the way of the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious citizen, his lo&s;s is not all the public injury. A fellow-citizen&mdash;perhaps a member of a legi&s;lature (and through him a legi&s;lature it&s;elf) is corrupted in his principles.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning the public debts.</HI></P>
<P>When it is remembered, that the terms upon which the debts of the &s;tates were a&s;&s;umed by cougre&s;s, are not more favourable than tho&s;e on which the &s;edral debt was funded, and when it is called to mind, that the una&s;&s;umed debts of all the &s;tates are le&s;s valuable

The relief of &s;ome of the &s;tates from their burdens, has been ano|ther beneficial con&s;equence of the funding of the debt. It is but a few years &s;ince one of the mo&s;t frugal, vigorous, and productive counties in Penn&s;ylvania ro&s;e again&s;t the collectors of the taxes. The appreciation and &s;ale of the immen&s;e ma&s;s of &s;ederal &s;ecurities, owned by that &s;tate, has enabled her to di&s;charge all her obliga|tions, though &s;he has aboli&s;hed her general land tax, and di&s;conti|nued her exci&s;e, both of which &s;he has collected for forty years.</P>
<P>Some anxiety has been created by the &s;hare of our debt, which for|eigners have obtained. But this was a powerful means of bringing the whole into its pre&s;ent beneficial action, by elevating its actual to its nominal value. It is not at all probable, that it will be drawn from the country. It has been ob&s;erved, in the mo&s;t tranquil and pro&s;perous &s;tate of Europe, that a great proportion of the families of tho&s;e foreigners, who have made large inve&s;tments in the united &s;tates, either in the times of the provinces, or &s;ince the revolution, have become inhabitants of this country, even when in its rude&s;t infant &s;tate. At this &s;erious moment, when almo&s;t every tran&s;at|lantic country &s;eels or apprehends di&s;orders, our chances are in|finitely increa&s;ed. The united &s;tates, advanced in the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence comfort, and of elegance, now pre&s;ent to them an object of greater de&s;ire in a tranquil liberty, which they are &s;truggling to obtain, a teeming agriculture, and a pro&s;perous commerce, both foreign and internal. Conformably with the&s;e reflexions, we may affirm, that no great object in our affairs has failed to attract the notice of the foreigners, who have engaged in our funds. The in|ternal navigation of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey and New-York, are among the witne&s;&s;es of this truth. The banks, both national and &s;tate, the turnpike roads, and toll bridges, the &s;ales of city e&s;tates, of cultivated farms, and particularly of unimproved lands, commerce, &s;hip-build|ing, manuta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tures, confirm the fact. Let us continue to exhibit an hone&s;t &s;pirit in our laws and con&s;titutions, an efficient execution of them, and due ab&s;tinence from unnece&s;&s;ary wars, and there cannot exi&s;t a doubt, that we &s;hall draw much more copiou&s;ly from the po|pulation, the arts, and the funds of Europe, than they will draw from tho&s;e of the united &s;tates.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts in the united &s;tates one de&s;cription of private diffi|culties and incumbrances, which mu&s;t engage the &s;olicitude of eve|ry feeling mind, which, by an examination into the detail and in|terior of our affairs, has been led to ob&s;erve them. The ca&s;es allud|ed to are tho&s;e of the citizens of two or three of the &s;tates, who are burdened with heavy debts or claims, which originated before the revolution. Whatever they may be finally adjudged to pay, the &s;um mu&s;t be &s;o great, and due from &s;o many per&s;ons, as to give it the re&s;emblance of a public debt: and as in one of tho&s;e &s;tates i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">as already occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;acrifices of their principal landed e&s;tates, very far below their value, &s;o it will probably operate in the others, unle&s;s &s;ome exten&s;ive means, abundantly adequate to the occa&s;ion, can be brought to operate, before or at lea&s;t at the time of executing the judgments of courts, which may be obtained. No re&s;ource, competent to the purpo&s;e, appears at all likely to pre|&s;ent it&s;elf, unle&s;s it be the funded debt or &s;tock of the united &s;tates and of the &s;everal &s;tates. The method by which this de&s;cription of
<PB N="33" REF="024230_0032_0FC57E7041081190">property can be rendered mo&s;t immediately and effectually &s;ub&s;er|vient to the intere&s;ting purpo&s;e of preventing the de&s;truction of many families, would &s;eem to be the fixture of it at a &s;table unfluctu|ating rate, adequate to its proper value, under the exi&s;ting circum|&s;tances of the united &s;tates. It is manife&s;t, that in &s;uch a &s;tate of the market, the dealers in the debt and others would &s;ell out, and would not buy in again, and that they would &s;eek objects for their money in the trade, the manufactures, the buildings, and the lands of the coun|try, which might promi&s;e them more advantage. A tenth part of the value of the public debts, applied to the lands of the united &s;tates, would rai&s;e them every where to their real value, &s;o that the debtor who might be under a nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ell an e&s;tate, could di&s;po&s;e of his property not only without a ruinous &s;acrifice, but probably to uncommon advantage. The proprietors of lands and buildings which might be under this probability of &s;ale, would &s;u&s;tain no ri&s;que or injury in &s;elling their e&s;tates for the public &s;tock.</P>
<P>It may be alleged, that the holders of the debt will not go into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cenes &s;o remote to make inve&s;tments: but there are facts, which appear to warrant a different opinion. The funds of New-England have been brought into Penn&s;ylvania, for inve&s;tment in lands of &s;everal kinds&mdash;the money of Penn&s;ylvania and Delaware has been inve&s;ted in mills and lands in Virginia&mdash;the greater part of the iron|works of Maryland (the mo&s;t co&s;tly e&s;tates in our country,) were bought and worked by the capitals of re&s;idents in Great Britain be|fore the revolution. The &s;ame fact exi&s;ted in one great in&s;tance in New Jer&s;ey. The greate&s;t cedar &s;wamp, on the waters of the Delaware, that &s;upplies the Philadelphia market, is owned in New England; and people and ve&s;&s;els from that quarter, are annually &s;ent to perform the bu&s;ine&s;s of it. The American public creditors, citizens of the unit|ed Netherlands, have recently purcha&s;ed eight hundred tracts of land in a part of Penn&s;ylvania, further from Philadelphia than the banks of James's River, York, or Rappahannock. In &s;hort, if the hi&s;tory of this country were examined, as it regards this &s;ubject, it would de|mon&s;trate, that the landed property of it has been con&s;tantly ani|mated by the application of the monies of di&s;tant capitali&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.</HI> Reflexions on the &s;tate of the union.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>NUMBER V.</HI> Concerning the foreign debts of the united &s;tates.</HEAD>
<P>AT the commencement of the pre&s;ent government in 1789, the united &s;tates were indebted to France, Holland and Spain, and to the foreign officers of the late army, in a &s;um amounting to near twelve millions of dollars. Near a million and two thirds of this &s;um, was due for arrears of intere&s;t, inattention to which, would have been too di&s;graceful to have admitted of a hope of public credit, until mea&s;ures were taken for its di&s;charge. Above a million and one third of the principal &s;um had become due, and the time of other in&s;tallments was coming round. The re&s;ources of the country had been examined and con&s;idered, but not tried. The claims of the&s;e foreign creditors, were, originally, the mo&s;t delicate in them&s;elves; and in the ca&s;e of France, the &s;tate of her revolution in the &s;ummer of 1790, placed her demand in a &s;ituation peculiarly intere&s;ting. It was perceived that the adoption of the fe|deral con&s;titution and the mea&s;ures taken to re&s;tore public credit, had made &s;trong and favourable impre&s;&s;ions on the European money lenders: and it was not doubted, that the arrears of intere&s;t and the principal due, might be di&s;charged by loans, upon terms which would produce very little lo&s;s. The requi&s;ite authorities were given by the legi&s;lature, which re&s;ulted in the borrowing of a &s;um equal to the di&s;charge of all the exigible debt. But as the occa|&s;ions of the French were likely to be emergent, and there was rea|&s;on to con&s;ide, that a firm and &s;teady pur&s;uit of the financial &s;y&s;|tem, which had by that time been adopted, and an adherence to the upright &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, would rapidly meliorate the cre|dit of the united &s;tates, it was deemed expedient to extend the au|thorities to borrow, to a &s;um equal to the whole of the foreign debt, provided the in&s;tallments not due could be di&s;charged by means of loans advantageous to the united &s;tates. The intere&s;t of above &s;even millions of the foreign debt, being at the rate of five per cent per annum, it was not doubted, that the money might be obtained &s;o as to render the di&s;charge of the part, not exigible, re|ally advantageous. It has accordingly happened, that a &s;um adequate to the principal and intere&s;t due, has been borrowed within the terms of the law, &s;o as to &s;upport the credit and good faith of the united &s;tates, and critically to accommodate the people of France. The further expectations of congre&s;s have al&s;o been fulfilled; a con&s;iderable loan at four and on half, and two loans at four per cent, having been effected, &s;o as to realize an advantage in the di&s;charge of a large part of the principal, which was at an intere&s;t of five per cent. The united &s;tates having thus com|muted their foreign debt, further than is due, with honour, and, on a medium of the whole, with advantage, are relieved by the&s;e operations from any po&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;&s;ure to perform the re|mainder of their European engagements. The friends of our pub|lic credit, of our national &s;afety and re&s;pectability, and of the re|volution
<PB N="36" REF="024230_0034_0FC57E7539FEB1E8">of France, among the citizens of the united &s;tates, will reflect upon this actual cour&s;e of events with cordial &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>The conclu&s;ion: being mi&s;cellaneous thoughts on the government.</HI></P>
<P>The people of the united &s;tates enjoy a peculiar felicity in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of principles of government and of civil and re|ligious liberty, more &s;ound, more accurately defined, and more exten&s;ively reduced to practice, than any preceding republicans. There is not one iota of delegating or delegated power, which is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or may not be acquired by every citizen. It is true, that there are in practice, &s;everal deviations in the di&s;tribu|tion of powers to the various &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the country, and to the proprietors of certain de&s;criptions of property; but the&s;e are acknowledged departures from principle, and are known to have ari&s;en out of the antecedent &s;tate of things. They could not be immediately corrected without violent &s;truggles and di&s;orders, and without injury to the property of de&s;criptions of citizens, too great for the country at any former period to compen&s;ate. Mild remedies are, however, daily applied to the&s;e partial di&s;ea&s;es; and it is manife&s;t, that the cour&s;e of time is dimini&s;hing, and will finally remove them. The right of legi&s;lative interpo&s;ition, on the part of the chief magi&s;trate, which, in the practice of another country, has been commuted for an unlawful and inju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous influ|ence, is here wrought into the e&s;&s;ence of the con&s;titution, and is not only exerci&s;ed in the independent and uncontrouled con&s;idera|tion of every re&s;olution and bill, but by the practical application of the negative.</P>
<P>The execution of the office of the chief magi&s;trate has been at|tended through a term of almo&s;t four years with a circum&s;tance, which to this nation and to the &s;urrounding world requires no commentary&mdash;<HI>a native citizen of the united &s;tates, elevated from private life to that &s;tation, has not, during &s;o long a term, appointed a &s;ingle re|lation to any office of honour or emolument.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;enatorial branch of the government has been created and continued in a mode preferable to that which is pur&s;ued in any other nation.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entative branch is equally well con&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The military code, for the government of &s;uch troops as are oc|ca&s;ionally rai&s;ed and employed, is well calculated to produce di&s;|cipline and efficiency, when time is allowed for the purpo&s;e, and con&s;equently to render the united &s;tates re&s;pectable in the eyes of foreign nations.</P>
<P>All chri&s;tian churches are &s;o truly upon an equal footing, as well in practice as in theory, that there are and have been in the legi&s;|lative, executive, and judicial branches of the general government, per&s;ons of the following denominations&mdash;epi&s;copalian, pre&s;byte|rian, independent or congregational, quaker, Lutheran, reformed, Roman, and probably others, which do not occur. There have been, and indeed yet are, a few eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;tinctions in the &s;tate governments, which rea&s;on and time are rapidly de&s;troying. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that religious liberty, &s;upported by the national con&s;titution, and a great majority of the &s;tate con&s;titutions, cannot but attain, in a very &s;hort time, the &s;ame theoretical and practical perfection in the remainder, which it has acquired in them.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="024230_0035_0FC57E76E7E31710">
The independency of the judiciary, as well in the tenure of their &s;tations as in the permanency of their compen&s;ations under the fede|ral con&s;titution, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e of the &s;tates, is an advantage over the ancient republics and the generality of modern governments, of ine&s;timable value in regard to liberty and property.</P>
<P>The united &s;tates, being without tran&s;marine or &s;eparated domi|nions, are exempted from two inconveniencies, which have re&s;ult|ed from them. An immen&s;e naval force has been found nece&s;&s;ary to defend &s;uch territories, and protect the trade with them in time of war, and the difficulty of devi&s;ing for them a free legi&s;lation, has hitherto proved in&s;urmountable. The Briti&s;h nation declared, that they had a right to legi&s;late for their colonies and dominions in A|merica, A&s;ia, and Africa, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, and the revolution of the united &s;tates, turned upon that cardinal point. When we ob&s;erve, that the French nation, devoted as they are to the pur&s;uit of liberty, have not yet been able to devi&s;e any &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment for their colonies without a <HI>dernier re&s;ort</HI> to the legi&s;lature of France, it will be a &s;ource of comfortable reflexion to the friends of free and efficient government in the&s;e &s;tates, that we are not per|plexed by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o delicate, important, and difficult an operation.</P>
<P>It has been unfortunate for mo&s;t nations, as well ancient as mo|dern, that they have had no &s;ettled pre-exi&s;ting mode of altering, amending, or renovating their political &s;y&s;tem, to which they could re&s;ort without a deviation from the legal cour&s;e of things, hazard|ing the public tranquillity, and often freedom it&s;elf.&mdash;It is equally happy for the people of the united &s;tates, that in their federal go|vernment, and in mo&s;t of tho&s;e of the &s;tates, there exi&s;ts a provi|&s;ion, by which tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and de&s;irable ends may be obtained, with whatever zeal, without recurring to irregularity or violence. Fundamental principles being already &s;ettled by common con&s;ent, and being duly recorded in the con&s;tituions, the people cannot long mi&s;take the nature of a mea&s;ure, a law, or a political maxim, which is really oppo&s;ed to them; and when their judgment is decided upon any one or more derelictions of tho&s;e principles, of magnitude &s;ufficient to induce an effort for reform, their will can|not be &s;ucce&s;sfully re&s;i&s;ted. The con&s;equence of this &s;tate of things will be, that the ma&s;s of error will not ea&s;ily accumulate &s;o as to become in&s;upportable, being kept down by the&s;e orderly natural exertions of the community to relieve them&s;elves at an earlier &s;tage of inconvenience. Too great a facility to change would, however, be likely to produce fluctuations, injurious to order, peace, proper|ty, and indu&s;try, if not to liberty it&s;elf: but as the mode of per|forming the amendatory or alterative operations is &s;low, and con&s;e|quently deliberate, light or dangerous changes would be very dif|ficult to accompli&s;h. In this view there appears to be very little probability, that changes from free or repre&s;entative government, will take place, or that any modification of hereditary power will be introduced into the governments either of the &s;tates or of the union. The people will never deliberately con&s;ent to the abroga|tion of tho&s;e clau&s;es in the &s;everal con&s;titutions, which explicitly provide both in general terms, and in particular detail, for free or republican government: nor does it &s;eem ea&s;y, con&s;idering the de|gree
<PB N="38" REF="024230_0036_0FC57E7923E846A8">of perfection we have obtained and the con&s;tant and mode|rate operations of the amendatory clau&s;es, to accumulate &s;ufficient public evil or grievance to produce one of tho&s;e convul&s;ions, which the ambitous are wont to &s;eize as the moment to introduce by force, a de&s;potic government. Even local circum&s;tances con&s;pire to favour the permanency of liberty in the&s;e &s;tates. Being too remote from any foreign nation, to render a war, requiring a great army, at all nece&s;&s;ary, that in&s;trument, &s;o often u&s;ed by ambitious leaders, is not likely to be placed within the reach of the enemies of free|dom, <HI>while the union remains entire.</HI> It is worthy of the mo&s;t parti|cular ob&s;ervation and remembrance, that a di&s;&s;olution of our go|vernment would immediately open a door to this danger, as the &s;e|veral &s;tates or little confederacies, would each deem it prudent to maintain a larger army than is now requi&s;ite for the whole. The hi&s;tory of Greece will in&s;truct us that by this, more than by any other po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure, we &s;hould be prepared for the military do|mination of &s;ome modern PHILIP, or &s;ome new ALEXANDER. <HI>A &s;trong union</HI> and <HI>a tranquil liberty</HI> would be mi&s;erably exchanged for &s;uch a &s;tate of things</P>
<P>It is an evident truth that the penal laws of the&s;e &s;tates, have been gradually mitigated &s;ince the epocha of their independence; and it is no le&s;s true, that the number of crimes does not bear &s;o great a proportion to the population, as was formerly the ca&s;e, though an univer&s;al relaxation of the police took place in the late war. It is, perhaps, an ill &s;ymptom of the &s;tate of things, in a &s;ociety, when <HI>mild laws, &s;trictly executed,</HI> are incompetent to the pre|&s;ervation of order and public happine&s;s. Our penal codes are, upon the whole, among the lea&s;t &s;anguinary; and it is believed, they are not cruel, even in tho&s;e unhappy ca&s;es, which impel the commu|nity to extremities. The con&s;titution of the united &s;tates has ex|tracted all the gall from the puni&s;hment of offences again&s;t the na|tional &s;afety, by correcting the power of legi&s;lating concerning them with a mildne&s;s unknown to the &s;y&s;tems of mo&s;t countries. It is honourable to the humanity and magnanimity of the Ameri|can people, that this proceeding flowed from them, almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly, four years after the revolution war. Future ages will do ju&s;|tice to a nation capable of &s;uch an effort at a moment &s;o particular.</P>
<P>Taking the united &s;tates at large, there are few or no coun|tries in which, at this time, the ju&s;t demands of private creditors can be obtained by a more certain, a more expeditions, or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expen&s;ive cour&s;e of legal proce&s;s. There are &s;ome local, and a very few general defects yet exi&s;ting; but they are vani&s;hing before the &s;pirit of the general and mo&s;t of the &s;tate con&s;titutions. There is no part of the public conduct of this country more &s;triking than the firmne&s;s with which they have applied the cau&s;tic to &s;ome inve|terate cancers, which had been derived to their pecuniary &s;y&s;tem, principally from adventitious cau&s;es. It proves the exi&s;tence of that virtue and fortitude, which qualify a nation for republican go|vernment. There are &s;ome exceptionable circum&s;tances, yet to be done away; but the &s;ucce&s;sful efforts, which have been made, ju&s;tify a confident expectation, that they will yield ere long to the powers and influences which have eradicated much greater evils of the &s;ame kind.</P>
