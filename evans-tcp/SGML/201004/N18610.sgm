<P>HAD there been any book in our language on the &s;ubject of the following letters, they never &s;hould have &s;een the light. The Author wrote them for the amu&s;ement of his friends, and as an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his memory; and if it will in any degree apologize for their imperfections, he can with truth declare that they never were intended for publication: Nor indeed was that idea &s;ugge&s;ted to him, 'till long after they were written. One principal motive he will own, was the de&s;ire of giving to the world, and perhaps of tran&s;mit|ting to po&s;terity, a monument of his friend&s;hip with the gentleman to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHEN Mr For&s;ter's tran&s;lation of Baron Reide&s;el's book fir&s;t appeared, the&s;e letters were already in the pre&s;s, and the Author apprehended an anticipation of his &s;ubject; however, on peru&s;al he had the &s;atisfaction to find, that the two works did not much interfere.</P>
<P>IN tran&s;cribing them for the pre&s;s, he found it nece&s;&s;ary both to retrench and to amplify; by which the ea&s;e of the epi&s;tolary &s;tyle has probably &s;uffered, and &s;ome of the letters have been extended much beyond their original length.</P>
<P>HE now pre&s;ents them to the Public with the great|e&s;t diffidence; hoping that &s;ome allowance will be made for the very inconvenient circum&s;tances, little favour|able to order or preci&s;ion, in which &s;ome of them were written: But he would not venture to new-model them; apprehending, that what they might gain in form and expre&s;&s;ion, they would probably lo&s;e in ea&s;e and &s;implicity; and well knowing that the original impre&s;&s;ions are better de&s;cribed at the moment they are felt, than from the mo&s;t exact recollection.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Naples,</HI> <DATE><HI>May</HI> 14, 1770.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Beckford,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Remember to have heard you re|gret, that in all your peregrinations through Europe, you had ever neg|lected the i&s;land of Sicily; and had &s;pent much of your time in running over the old beaten track, and in examining the threadbare &s;ubjects of Italy and France; when probably there were a variety of objects, not le&s;s intere&s;ting, that &s;till lay buried in oblivion in that cele|brated i&s;land. We intend to profit from this hint of yours. Fullarton has been urging me to it with all that ardour, which a new pro&s;pect of acquiring know|ledge ever in&s;pires in him; and Glover, your old acquaintance, has promi&s;ed to accompany us.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="024150_0012_0FC3C2ED33B4C930">The Italians repre&s;ent it as impo&s;&s;ible: as there are no inns in the i&s;land, and many of the roads are over dangerous precipices, or through bogs and fore&s;ts, in|fe&s;ted with the mo&s;t re&s;olute and daring banditti in Europe. However, all the&s;e con&s;iderations, formidable as they may appear, did not deter Mr. Hamilton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now knight of the Bath.</NOTE>, his lady, and Lord Fortro&s;e. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Now earl of Seaforth.</NOTE> They made this expedition la&s;t &s;ummer; and returned &s;o much delighted with it, that they have animated us with the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of enjoying &s;ame plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t plan was to go by land to Regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and from thence, cro&s;s over to Me&s;&s;ina; but on making exact inquiry, with regard to the &s;tate of the country, and method of traveling, we find that the danger from the banditti in Calabria and Apulia is &s;o great, the accom|modations &s;o wretched, and inconveniencies of every kind &s;o numerous, without any con&s;ideration whatever to throw into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, that we &s;oon relinqui&s;h|ed that &s;cheme; and in &s;pite of all the terrors of Scylla and Charybdis, and the more real terrors of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s (the mo&s;t formidable mon&s;ter of the three) we have determined to go by water: And, that no time may be lo&s;t we have already taken our pa&s;&s;age onboard an En|gli&s;h &s;hip, which is ready to &s;ail with the fir&s;t fair wind.</P>
<P>Now, as this little expedition has never been con|&s;idered as any part of the grand tour; and as it will probably pre&s;ent many objects worthy of your attention, not mentioned in any of our books of travels; I flatter my&s;elf that a &s;hort account of the&s;e will not be unac|ceptable to you; and may in &s;ome degree make up for your having neglected to vi&s;it them. You may therefore expect to hear of me, from every town where we &s;top; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd when I meet with any thing de&s;erving of notice, I
<PB N="3" REF="024150_0013_0FC3C2F5CAA00438">
&s;hall attempt to de&s;cribe it in as few words as po&s;&s;ible. We have been waiting with impatience for a fair wind, but at pre&s;ent there is little pro&s;pect of it. The weather is exceedingly rough, and not a &s;hip has been able to get out of the harbour for upwards of three weeks pa&s;t. This climate is by no means what we expected to find it; and the &s;erene &s;ky of Italy, &s;o much boa&s;ted of by our travelled gentlemen, does not altogether de&s;erve the great eulogiums be&s;towed upon it. It is now the middle of May, and we have not as yet had any continuance of what may be called fine weather. It has, indeed, been abundantly warm, but &s;eldom a day has pa&s;&s;ed without &s;udden &s;torms of wind and rain, which render walking out here to the full as dangerous to our invalids, as it is in England.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that our phy&s;icians are under &s;ome mi&s;take with regard to this climate. It is certainly one of the warme&s;t in Italy; but it is as certainly one of the mo&s;t incon&s;tant; and from what we have ob&s;erved, di&s;agrees with the greate&s;t part of our vale|tudinarians; but more particularly with the gouty people, who have all found them&s;elves better at Rome; which, though much colder in winter, is, I believe, a healthier climate. Naples to be &s;ure is more eligible in &s;ummer, as the air is con&s;tantly refre&s;hed by the &s;ea breeze, when Rome is often &s;corched by the mo&s;t in&s;upportable heat. La&s;t &s;ummer, Fahrenheit's ther|mometer never ro&s;e higher at Naples than 76. At Rome it was at 89. The difference is often &s;till more con&s;iderable. In winter it is not le&s;s remarkable. Here, our greate&s;t degree of cold was in the end of January; the thermometer &s;tood at 36; at Rome it fell to 27; &s;o that the di&s;tance between the two extremes of heat and cold la&s;t year at Naples, was only 40 degrees: whereas at Rome it was no le&s;s than 62. Yet, by all
<PB N="4" REF="024150_0014_0FC3C2F7E73965A8">
accounts, their winter was much more agreeable and healthy than ours. For they had clear fro&s;ty weather, whil&s;t we were deluged with rains, accompanied with very high wind. The people here a&s;&s;ure us, that in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons it has rained every day for &s;ix or &s;even weeks. But the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of the Neapoli|tan climate is the &s;irocc or &s;outh-ea&s;t wind, which is very common at this &s;ea&s;on. It is infinitely more relaxing, and gives the vapours in a much higher degree, than the wor&s;t of our rainy Novembers. It has now blown for the&s;e &s;even days without intermi&s;|&s;ion; and has indeed blown away all our gaiety and &s;pirits; and if it continues much longer, I do not know what may be the con&s;equence. It gives a degree of la&s;&s;itude, both to the body and mind, that renders them ab&s;olutely incapable of performing their u&s;ual functions. It is not perhaps &s;urpri&s;ing, that it &s;hould produce the&s;e effects on a phlegmatic Engli&s;h con&s;titution; but we have ju&s;t now an in&s;tance, that all the mercury of France mu&s;t &s;ink under the load of this horrid leaden atmo&s;phere. A &s;mart Pari&s;ian marquis came here about ten days ago; he was &s;o full of animal &s;pirits that the people thought him mad. He never remained a moment in the &s;ame place; but, at their grave conver|&s;ations, u&s;ed to &s;kip from room to room with &s;uch amazing ela&s;ticity, that the Italians &s;wore he had got &s;prings in his &s;hoes. I met him this morning, walk|ing with the &s;tep of a philo&s;opher; a &s;melling bottle in his hand, and all his vivacity extingui&s;hed. I a&s;ked what was the matter? "Ah; mon ami," &s;aid he, <Q>je m'ennui &agrave; la mort;&mdash;moi, qui n'ai jamais &s;&ccedil;e l'ennui. Mais cet execrable vent m'accable; et deux jours de plus, et je me pend.</Q></P>
<P>The natives them&s;elves do not &s;uffer le&s;s than &s;trangers; and all nature &s;eems to langui&s;h during this
<PB N="5" REF="024150_0015_0FC3C2F91F290148">
abominable wind. A Neapolitan lover avoids his mi&s;tre&s;s with the utmo&s;t care in the time of the &s;irocc, and the indolence it in&s;pires, is almo&s;t &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h every pa&s;&s;ion. All works of genius are laid a&s;ide, during its continuance; and when any thing very flat or in&s;ipid is produced, the &s;tronge&s;t phra&s;e of di&s;approbation they can be&s;tow is, <Q>Era &s;critto in tempo del &s;irocco;</Q> that it was writ in the time of the &s;irocc. I &s;hall make no other apology for this letter; and whenever I happen to tire you, be kind enough to remember (pray do) that it is not me you are to blame, but the &s;irocc wind. This will put me much at my ea&s;e, and will &s;ave us a world of time in apologies.</P>
<P>I have been endeavouring to get &s;ome account of the cau&s;e of this very &s;ingular quality of the &s;irocc; but the people here &s;eldom think of accounting for any thing, and I do not find, notwith&s;tanding its remarkable effects, that it has ever yet been an object of enquiry among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I have not ob&s;erved that the &s;irocc makes any re|markable change in the barometer. When it fir&s;t &s;et in, the mercury fell about a line and a half; and has continued much about the &s;ame height ever &s;ince; but the thermometer was at 43 the morning it began, and and ro&s;e almo&s;t immediately to 65; and for the&s;e two days pa&s;t it has been at 70 and 71. However, it is certainly not the warmth of this wind, that renders it &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;pirits; it is rather the want of the genial quality, which is &s;o enlivening; and which ever renders the we&s;tern breeze &s;o agreeable: The &s;pring and ela&s;ticity of the air &s;eems to be lo&s;t; and that active principle which animates all nature, appears to be dead. This principle we have &s;ometimes &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="024150_0016_0FC3C2FAF037AC78">
to be nothing el&s;e than the &s;ubtle electric fluid that the air u&s;ually contains; and indeed, we have found, that during this wind, it appears to be almo&s;t annihilated, or at lea&s;t, its activity exceedingly reduced. Ye&s;terday, and to-day, we have been attempting to make &s;ome electrical experiments; but I never before found the air &s;o unfavourable for them.</P>
<P>Sea-bathing we have found to be the be&s;t antidote again&s;t the effects of the &s;irocc; and this we certainly enjoy in great perfection. Lord Fortro&s;e, who is the &s;oul of our colony here, has provided a large commo|dious boat for this purpo&s;e. We meet every morning at eight o'clock, and row about half a mile out to &s;ea, where we &s;trip and plunge into the water: Were it not for this, we &s;hould all of us have been as bad as the French marquis. My lord has ten watermen, who are in reality a &s;ort of amphibious animals, as they live one half the &s;ummer in the &s;ea. Three or four of the&s;e generally go in with us, to pick up &s;tragglers, and &s;ecure us from all accidents. They dive with ea&s;e to the depth of forty, and &s;ometimes of fifty feet; and bring up quantities of excellent &s;hell-fi&s;h during the &s;ummer months; but &s;o great is their devotion, that every time they go down they make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and mutter an Ave Maria, without which they think &s;hould certainly be drowned; and were not a little &s;candalized at us for omitting this ceremony. To accu&s;tom us to &s;wimming in all circum&s;tances, my lord has provided a &s;uit of clothes, which we wear by turns; and from a very &s;hort practice, we have found it almo&s;t as commodious to &s;wim with as without them; we have likewi&s;e learned to &s;trip in the water, and find it no very difficult matter: And I am fully per&s;uaded, from being accu&s;tomed to this kind of exer|ci&s;e, that in ca&s;e of &s;hipwreck we &s;hould have greatly
<PB N="7" REF="024150_0017_0FC3C2FC26DCE210">
the advantage over tho&s;e who had never practi&s;ed it; for it is by the embarra&s;&s;ment from the clothes, and the agitation that people are throw into, from finding them&s;elves in a &s;ituation they had never experienced before, that &s;o many lives are lo&s;t in the water.</P>
<P>After bathing, we have an Engli&s;h breakfa&s;t at his lord&s;hip's and after breakfa&s;t, delightful little con|cert, which la&s;ts for an hour and a half. Barbella, the &s;weete&s;t fiddle in Italy, leads our little band. This party, I think, con&s;titutes one principal part of the plea&s;ure we enjoy at Naples. We have likewi&s;e &s;ome very agreeable &s;ociety among&s;t our&s;elves, though we cannot boa&s;t much of that with the inhabitants. There are to be &s;ure many good people among&s;t them; but in general, there is &s;o very little analogy betwixt an Engli&s;h and a Neapolitan mind, that the true &s;ocial harmony, that great &s;weetener of human life, can &s;eldom be produced. In lieu of this, (the exchange you will &s;ay is but a bad one) the country round Naples abounds &s;o much in every thing that is curious, both in art and nature, and affords &s;o ample a field of &s;peculation for the naturali&s;t and antiquary, that a per&s;on of any curi|o&s;ity may &s;pend &s;ome months here very agreeably, and not without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">fit.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the di&s;coveries of Herculaneum and Pompeia which, of themselves, afford a great fund of entertain|ment, the whole coa&s;t that &s;urrounds this beautiful bay, particularly that near Puzzoli, Cuma Micenum, and Baia, is covered with innumerable monuments of Roman magnificence&punc; But, alas! how are the mighty fallen! This delightful coa&s;t, once the garden of all Italy, and inhabited only by the rich, the gay, and lux|urious, is now abandoned to the poore&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable of mortals. Perhaps, there is no &s;pot on the

globe, that has undergone &s;o thorough a change; or that can exhibit &s;o &s;triking a picture of the vanity of human grandeur. Tho&s;e very walls that once lodged a Cae&s;ar, a Lucullus, an Anthony, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t voluptuous of mankind; are now occupied by the very meane&s;t and mo&s;t indigent wretches on earth, who are actually &s;tarving for want in tho&s;e very apartments that were the &s;cenes of the greate&s;t luxury. There we are told that &s;uppers were frequently given, that co&s;t fifty thou&s;and pounds; and &s;ome, that even amounted to double that &s;um.</P>
<P>The luxury indeed of Baia was &s;o great, that it became a proverb, even among&s;t the luxurious Ro|mans them&s;elves; and, at Rome, we often find them upbraiding with effeminacy and epicuri&s;m, tho&s;e who &s;pent much of their time in this &s;cene of delights; Clodius throws it in Cicero's teeth more than once: And that orator's having purcha&s;ed a villa here, hurt him not a little in the opinion of the graver and more au&s;tere part of the &s;enate. The walls of the&s;e palaces &s;till remain, and the poor pea&s;ants, in &s;ome places, have built up their mi&s;erable huts within them; but, at pre&s;ent, there is not one gentleman or man of fa&s;hion re&s;iding in any part of this country; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> former &s;tate of which, compared with the pre&s;ent, certainly makes the mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;t imaginable.

<P>WE have now begun our expedition with every au&s;picious omen. This morning the melancholy force left us; and in place of it we have gotton a fine bri&s;k tramontane (or northwind) which in a few hours blew away all our vapours, and made us wonder how much the happine&s;s of mankind depends on a bla&s;t of wind. After eating a hearty dinner with many of our friends at Mr. Walter's, and drinking plentifully of his excellent burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, we took leave in the highe&s;t &s;pirits. Had the &s;irocc blown as ye&s;terday, we &s;hould probably have been in tears; and not one of us would have &s;u&s;pected that we were crying, only becau&s;e the wind was in the &s;outh. We are not apt to &s;uppo&s;e it; but probably a great part of our plea&s;ures and pains depend upon &s;uch trivial cau&s;es, though always a&s;cribed to &s;omething el&s;e; few people being willing to own them|&s;elves like a weathercock, affected by every bla&s;t. Indeed we &s;hould have naturally imputed it to the grief of parting with that excellent family whom you know &s;o well; which no per&s;on could ever leave without
<PB N="10" REF="024150_0020_0FC3C300A38B2EA0">
regret, or &s;ee without plea&s;ure; but the agreeable pro&s;|pect of &s;oon meeting again, (probably better qualified to amu&s;e and entertain them) ab&s;orbed all melancholy thoughts; and even added to that alacrity, which the delightful tour before us had already in&s;pired.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed at five; and after firing our farewell &s;ignals to our friends on &s;hore, (whom we di&s;covered with our gla&s;&s;es at &s;ome miles di&s;tance) we &s;oon found our|&s;elves in the middle of the bay of Naples, &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery in the world. It fell calm for an hour, on purpo&s;e to give us time to contemplate all its beauties.</P>
<P>The bay is of a circular figure; in mo&s;t places up|wards of 20 miles in diameter; &s;o that including all its breaks and inequalities, the circumference is con&s;ider|ably more than 60 miles. The whole of this &s;pace is &s;o wonderfully diver&s;ified, by all the riches both of art and nature, that there is &s;carce an object wanting to render the &s;cene complete; and it is hard to &s;ay, whether the view is more plea&s;ing from the &s;ingularity of many of the&s;e objects, or from the incredible variety of the whole. You &s;ee an amazing mixture of the ancient and modern; &s;ome ri&s;ing to fame, and &s;ome &s;inking to ruin. Palaces reared over the tops of other palaces, and ancient magnificence trampled under foot&mdash;by modern folly&mdash;Mountains and i&s;lands, that were celebrated for their fertility, changed into barren wa&s;tes; and barren wa&s;tes into fertile fields and rich vineyards. Mountains &s;unk into plains, and plains &s;welled into mountains. Lakes drunk up by volcanos, and extingui&s;hed volcanos turned into lakes. The earth &s;till &s;moking in many places; and in others

throwing out flame.&mdash;In &s;hort, nature &s;eems to have formed this in her mo&s;t capricious mood; for every object is a lu&s;us naturae. She never &s;eems to have gone &s;eriou&s;ly to work; but to have devoted this &s;pot to the mo&s;t unlimited indulgence of caprice and frolic.</P>
<P>The bay is &s;hut out from the Mediterranean by the i&s;land of Capr&egrave;, &s;o famous for the abode of Augu&s;tus; and afterwards &s;o infamous for that of Tiberius. A little to the we&s;t lie tho&s;e of I&s;chia, Procida, and Ni&s;ida; the celebrated promontory of Micaenum, where Aeneas landed; the cla&s;&s;ic fields of Baia, Cuma, and Puzzoli; with all the variety of &s;cenery that formed both the Tartarus and Ely&s;ium of the ancients; the Campi Phlegr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i, or burning plains where Jupiter overcame the giants; the Monte Novo, formed of late years by fire, the Monte Barbaro; the picture&s;que city of Puz|zoli, with the Solfaterra &s;moaking above it; the beau|tiful promontory of Pau&s;illippe, exhibiting the fine&s;t &s;cenery that can be imagined; the great and opulent city of Naples, with its three ca&s;tles, its harbour full of &s;hips from every nation, its palaces, churches, and convents innumerable. The rich country from thence to Portici, covered with noble hou&s;es and gardens, and appearing only a continuation of the city. The palace of the king, with many others &s;urrounding it, all built over the roofs of tho&s;e of Herculaneum, buried near a hundred feet, by the eruptions of Ve&s;uvius. The black fields of lava that have run from that mountain, in|termixed with gardens, vineyards, and orchards. Ve&s;u|vius it&s;elf, in the back ground of the &s;cene, di&s;charging volumes of fire and &s;moak, and forming a broad track in the air over our heads, extending without being broken or di&s;&s;ipated to the utmo&s;t verge of the horizon.
<PB N="12" REF="024150_0022_0FC3C303F54465F8">
A variety of beautiful towns and villages, round the ba&s;e of the mountain, thoughtle&s;s of the impending ruin that daily threatens them. Some of the&s;e are reared over the very roofs of Pompeia and Stabia, where Pliny peri&s;hed; and with their foundations have pierced through the &s;acred abodes of the ancient Romans; thou&s;ands of whom lie buried here, the victims of this inexorable mountain. Next follows the exten&s;ive and romantic coa&s;t of Ca&s;tello Mare, Sorrentum, and Mo|la; diver&s;ified with every picture&s;que object in nature. It was the &s;tudy of this wild and beautiful country that formed our greate&s;t land&s;cape-painters. This was the &s;chool of Pou&s;&s;in and Salvator Ro&s;a, but more partic|ularly of the la&s;t, who compo&s;ed many of his mo&s;t celebrated pieces from the bold craggy rocks that &s;urround this coa&s;t; and no doubt it was from the daily contemplation of the&s;e romantic objects, that they &s;tored their minds with that variety of ideas they have communicated to the world with &s;uch elegance in their works.</P>
<P>Now, &s;hould I tell you that this exten&s;ive coa&s;t, this prodigious variety of mountains, vallies, promontories and i&s;lands, covered with an everla&s;ting verdure, and loaded with the riche&s;t fruits, is all the produce of &s;ubterraneous fire; it would require, I am afraid, too great a &s;tretch of faith to believe me; yet the fact is certain, and can only be doubted by tho&s;e who have wanted time or curio&s;ity to examine it. It is &s;trange, you will &s;ay, that nature &s;hould make u&s;e of the &s;ame agent to create as to de&s;troy; and that what has only been looked upon as the con&s;umer of countries, is in fact the very power that produces them. Indeed, this part of our earth &s;eems already to have undergone the &s;entence pronounced upon the whole of it: But like the phoenix, has ri&s;en again from its own a&s;hes, in much
<PB N="13" REF="024150_0023_0FC3C305204AB940">
greater beauty and &s;plendour than before it was con&s;u|med. The traces of the&s;e dreadful conflagrations are &s;till con&s;picuous in every corner; they have been vio|lent in their operations, but in the end have proved &s;alutary in their effects. The fire in many places is not yet extingui&s;hed, but Ve&s;uvius is now the only &s;pot where it rages with any degree of activity.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton, our mini&s;ter here, who is no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed in the learned, than in the polite world, has lately examined it with a truly philo&s;ophic eye, and this is the re&s;ult of all his ob&s;ervations; however, at pre&s;ent, I only &s;it down to give you an account of the pro&s;pect of this &s;ingular country, and not to write its natural hi&s;tory; which would lead me into too va&s;t a field: I &s;hall re&s;erve that curious &s;ubject 'till our return, when I &s;hall have more lei&s;ure to make you acquainted with it.&mdash;I beg therefore you would at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend your judgment for the pre&s;ent, and do not condemn me before I am heard.</P>
<P>After contemplating this delightful pro&s;pect, 'till &s;un|&s;et, the wind &s;prung up again, and we have now almo&s;t reached Capr&egrave;, 30 miles di&s;tant from Naples. We have ju&s;t &s;poken with an Engli&s;h &s;hip. They tell us, that the Marquis of Carmarthen, Lord Fortro&s;e, and Mr. Hamilton ob&s;erving the calm, took a boat to make us a vi&s;it; but unfortunately mi&s;taking their ve&s;&s;el for ours, we have had the mortification to mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>The night is very dark, and mount Ve&s;uvius is flaming at a dreadful rate: We can ob&s;erve the red|hot &s;tones thrown to a va&s;t height in the air; and, after their fall rolling down the &s;ide of the mountain. Our &s;hip is going &s;o &s;mooth, that we are &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of the motion; and if this wind continues, before to-morrow

<P>16th. All wrong&mdash;Sick to death&mdash;Execrable &s;irocc wind, and directly contrary&mdash;Vile heaving waves&mdash;A plague of all &s;ea voyages.&mdash;That author was &s;urely right, who &s;aid, that <HI>land voyages</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Tour to the Ea&s;t.</NOTE> were much to be preferred.</P>
<P>17th in the morning. For the&s;e 24 hours pa&s;t we have been groaning to one another from our beds; execrating the waves, and wi&s;hing that we had rather been at the mercy of all the banditti of Calabria. We are now beginning to change our tune. The &s;irocc is gone, and the wind is con&s;iderably fallen; however, we are &s;till three woful figures. Our &s;ervants too are as &s;ick and as helple&s;s as we. The captain &s;ays, that Philip, our Sicilian man, was frightened out of his wits; and has been praying to St. Januarius with all his might. He now thinks he has heard him, and imputes the change of the weather entirely to his intere&s;t with his &s;aint.</P>
<P>17th. Three o'clock. Weather plea&s;ant and favourable&mdash;A fine breeze &s;ince ten;&mdash;have ju&s;t come in &s;ight of Strombolo.&mdash;Our pilot &s;ays it is near 20 leagues off.

<P>Eleven at night. The weather is now fine, and we are all well. After &s;pying Strombolo, by degrees we came in &s;ight of the re&s;t of the Lipari i&s;lands, and part
<PB N="15" REF="024150_0025_0FC3C3082A5762D0">
of the coa&s;t of Sicily. The&s;e i&s;lands are very pictur|e&s;que, and &s;everal of them &s;till emit &s;moak, particularly Volcano and Volcanello; but none of them, for &s;ome ages pa&s;t, except Strombolo, have made any eruptions of fire. We are ju&s;t now lying within about three miles of that curious i&s;land, and can &s;ee its operations di&s;tinct|ly. It appears to be a volcano of a very different nature from Ve&s;uvius, the explo&s;ions of which &s;ucceed one another with &s;ome degree of regularity, and have no great variety of duration. Now I have been ob&s;erving Strombolo, ever &s;ince it fell dark, with a good deal of plea&s;ure, but not without &s;ome degree of perplexity, as I cannot account for its variety. Sometimes its explo&s;ions re&s;emble tho&s;e of Ve&s;uvius, and the light &s;eems only to be occa&s;ioned by the quantity of fiery &s;tones thrown into the air; and as &s;oon as the&s;e have fallen down, it appears to be extingui&s;hed, 'till another explo&s;ion cau&s;es a fre&s;h illumination: This I have ob&s;erved always to be the ca&s;e with Ve&s;uvius; except when the lava has ri&s;en to the &s;ummit of the mountain, &amp; continued without variety to illuminate the air around it.&mdash;The light from Strombolo evidently depends on &s;ome other cau&s;e. Sometimes a clear red flame i&s;&s;ues from the crater of the mountain, and continues to blaze without interruption, for near the &s;pace of half an hour. The fire is of a different colour from the explo&s;ions of &s;tones, and is evidently produced from a different cau&s;e. It would &s;eem as if &s;ome inflammable &s;ub&s;tance were &s;uddenly kindled up in the bowels of the mountain. It is attended with no noi&s;e, nor explo&s;ion that we are &s;en&s;ible of. It has now fallen calm, and we &s;hall probably have an opportunity of examining this volcano more minutely to-morrow. We are told at Naples that it had lately made a violent eruption, and had begun to form a new i&s;land at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the old; which piece of intelligence was one of our great
<PB N="16" REF="024150_0026_0FC3C30E9D39EB18">
inducements to this expedition. We think we have di&s;covered this i&s;land, as we have ob&s;erved &s;everal times the appearance of a &s;mall flame ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, a little to the &s;outhwe&s;t of Strombolo; and &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued from this new i&s;land; but it is po&s;&s;ible this light may come from the lower part of the i&s;land of Strombolo it&s;elf. We &s;hall &s;ee to-morrow.</P>
<P>18th. We are &s;till off Strombolo, but unfortunately at pre&s;ent it intercepts the view of that &s;pot from whence we ob&s;erved the flame to ari&s;e, and we can &s;ee no appearance of any new i&s;land, nor indeed of any lava that has of late &s;prung from the old one. We have a di&s;tinct view of the crater of Strombolo, which &s;eems to be different from Ve&s;uvius, and all the old volcanos that &s;urround Naples. Of the&s;e, the craters are without exception in the center, and form the highe&s;t part of the mountain. That of Strombolo is on its &s;ide, and not within 200 yards of its &s;ummit. From the crater to the &s;ea, the i&s;land is entirely compo&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;ort of a&s;hes and burnt matter as the conical part of Ve&s;uvius; and the quantity of this matter is perpetually increa&s;ing from the uninterrupted di&s;charge from the mountain; for of all the volcanos we read of, Strombolo &s;ems to be the only one that burns without cea&s;ing. Aetna and Ve&s;uvius often lie quiet for many months, even years, without the lea&s;t appearance of fire, but Strom|bolo is ever at work, and for ages pa&s;t has been looked upon as the great light-hou&s;e of the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>It is truly wonderful, how &s;uch a con&s;tant and im|men&s;e fire is maintained for thou&s;ands of years, in the mid&s;t of the ocean! that of the other Lipari i&s;lands &s;eems now almo&s;t extinct, and the force of the whole to be concentered in Strombolo, which acts as one great vent to them all. We &s;till ob&s;erve Volcano and
<PB N="17" REF="024150_0027_0FC3C30FBB4EE450">
Volcanello throwing out volumes of &s;moak, but during the whole night we could not perceive the lea&s;t &s;park of fire from either of them.</P>
<P>It is probable, that Strombolo, as well as all the re&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, is originally the work of &s;ubterraneous fire. The matter of which they are compo&s;ed, in a manner demon&s;trates this; and many of the Sicilian authors confirm it. There are now eleven of them in all; and none of the ancients mention more than &s;even. Fazzello, one of the be&s;t Sicilian authors, gives an account of the production of Volcano, now one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e i&s;lands. He &s;ays it happened in the early time of the republic, and is recorded by Eu&s;ebius, Pliny, and others. He adds, that even in his time, in the beginning of the 16th century, it &s;till di&s;|charged quantities of fire and of pumice &s;tones; but that in the preceding century, in the year 1444, on the 5th of February, there had been a very great eruption of this i&s;land, which &s;hook all Sicily, and alarmed the coa&s;t of Italy as far as Naples. He &s;ays the &s;ea boiled all around the i&s;land, and rocks of a va&s;t &s;ize were di&s;|charged from the crater; that fire and &s;moak in many places pierced through the waves, and that the naviga|tion among&s;t the&s;e i&s;lands was totally changed; rocks appearing where it was formerly deep water; and many of the &s;traits and &s;hallows were entirely filled up.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves, that Ari&s;totle, in his book on meteors, takes notice of a very early eruption of this i&s;land, by which not only the coa&s;t of Sicily, but likewi&s;e many cities in Italy were covered with a&s;hes. It has prob|ably been that very eruption which formed the i&s;land.

the ca&s;e. The greate&s;t part of it appears to be bar|ren. On the north &s;ide there are a few vineyards; but they are very meagre: Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, there is a rock at &s;ome di&s;tance from land; it &s;eems to be en|tirely of lava, and is not le&s;s than 50 or 60 feet above the water.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land of Strombolo is a mountain that ri&s;es &s;uddenly from the &s;ea; it is about ten miles round, and is not of the exact conical form, &s;uppo&s;ed common to all volcanos. We were determined to have landed on the i&s;land, and to have attempted to examine the volcano; but our Sicilian pilot a&s;&s;ures us, that the crater is not only inacce&s;&s;ible (which indeed I own it appears to be) but that we &s;hall likewi&s;e be obliged to perform a quarantine of 48 hours at Me&s;&s;ina; and that be&s;ides, we &s;hould run a great ri&s;k of being attacked by the natives, who are little better than &s;avages, and always on the alarm again&s;t the Turks.&mdash;On weighing the&s;e rea&s;ons, and putting the que&s;tion, it was carried, to proceed on our voyage.</P>
<P>I own it is with much regret that I leave this curious i&s;land, without being better acquainted with it. I have been looking with a good gla&s;s all round, but can &s;ee no marks of the eruption we heard &s;o much of at Nap|les; indeed, the &s;outh-we&s;t part, where we &s;aw the appearance of fire, is &s;till hid from us by the interpo|&s;ition of the i&s;land; and if there has been an eruption, it was certainly on that &s;ide: It is probable we &s;hall never be able to learn whether there has been one or not; or, at lea&s;t, to make our&s;elves ma&s;ters of any of the particulars relating to it; for events of that kind do not make &s;uch a noi&s;e in this ignorant and indolent country, as the blowing of an aloe, or a goo&s;eberry bu&s;h at Chri&s;tmas, does in England. Strombolo ri&s;es

to a great height; our pilot &s;ays, higher than Ve&s;uvi|us; but I think he is mi&s;taken. Both the captain and he agree, that in clear weather it is di&s;coverable at the di&s;tance of 25 leagues; and that at night its flames are to be &s;een &s;till much farther; &s;o that its vi&s;ible hori|zon cannot be le&s;s than 500 miles, which will require a very con&s;iderable elevation.</P>
<P>The revenue the&s;e i&s;lands bring to the king of Nap|les is by no means incon&s;iderable. They produce great quantities of alum, &s;ulphur, nitre, cinnabar, and mo&s;t &s;orts of fruits, particularly rai&s;ins, currants, and figs in great perfection; &s;ome of their wines are like|wi&s;e much e&s;teemed; particularly the Malva&s;ia, well known all over Europe.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Lipari (from which all the re&s;t take the name) is by much the large&s;t, as well as the mo&s;t fertile. By the de&s;cription of Ari&s;totle, it appears that it was in his time, what Strombolo is in ours, con&s;id|ered by &s;ailors as a light-hou&s;e, as its fires were never extingui&s;hed. It has not &s;uffered from &s;ubterraneous fires for many ages pa&s;t, though it every where bears tho marks of its former &s;tate. This is the i&s;land &s;uppo&s;ed by Virgil (who is one of our traveling com|panions) to be the habitation Aeolus; but indeed all of them were formerly called Aeolian. As they were full of va&s;t caverns, roaring with internal fires, the poets feigned that Aeolus kept the winds pri&s;oners here, and let them out at his plea&s;ure. This allegorical fiction is of great u&s;e both to Virgil and Homer, when they want to make a &s;torm, and forms no incon&s;iderable part of their machinery. A godde&s;s has nothing to do but take a flight to the Lipari i&s;lands, and Aeolus, who was the very pink of courte&s;y, has always a &s;torm ready at her command.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="024150_0030_0FC3C3141676DAC0">Homer indeed, departing &s;adly from his u&s;ual dignity, &s;uppo&s;es that Aeolus kept the winds here, each tied up in their re&s;pective bags; and when any particular wind was demanded, he made them a pre&s;ent of a bag full of it, to u&s;e at di&s;cretion. Some of the ancient hi&s;to|rians (Diodorus I think) &s;ays that this fable took its ri&s;e from a wi&s;e king named Aeolus; who, from ob&s;erving the &s;moke of the&s;e burning i&s;lands, and other phaenomena attending them, had learned to foretel the weather; and from thence was &s;aid to have the command of the winds.</P>
<P>The forge of Vulcan too has been &s;uppo&s;ed by the poets to be placed in Hiera, one of the&s;e i&s;lands.

the time of the Republic. So that Virgil commits here a very great anachroni&s;m, in &s;ending Vulcan to a place which at that time did not exi&s;t, nor for many ages after. But this bold poetical licence he amply repays us for, by the fine de&s;cription he gives of it. The&s;e i&s;lands, he &s;ays, were called Volcanian as well as Aeolian:
<Q>"Volcani domus, et Volcania nomine tellus."</Q>
So that the change of the name from Hiera to Volcano was a very natural one. This is the i&s;land that Pliny calls Tera&s;ia; and both Strabo and he gave an account of its production.</P>
<P>19th. Found our&s;elves within half a mile of the coa&s;t of Sicily, which is low, but finely variegated. The oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Calabria is very high and the mountains are covered with the fine&s;t verdure. It was almo&s;t a dead calm, our &s;hip &s;carce moving half a mile in an hour, &s;o that we had time to get a complete view of the famous rock of Scylla, on the Calabrian &s;ide, Cape Pylorus on the Sicilian, and the celebrated Straits of the Faro that runs between them. Whil&s;t we were &s;till &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iles di&s;tant from the entry of the Straits, we heard the roaring of the current, like the noi&s;e of &s;ome large impetuous river confined between narrow banks. This encrea&s;ed in proportion as we advanced, 'till we &s;aw the water in many places rai&s;ed to a con&s;iderable height, and forming large eddies or whirlpools. The &s;ea in every other place was as &s;mooth as gla&s;s. Our old pilot told us, that he had often &s;een &s;hips caught in the&s;e eddies, and whirled about with great rapidity, without obeying the helm in the &s;malle&s;t degree. When the weather is calm, there is little danger; but when the waves meet with this violent current, it makes a dreadful &s;ea. He &s;ays, there were five &s;hips wrecked in this &s;pot la&s;t winter.
<PB N="22" REF="024150_0032_0FC3C3172D5EF1C8">
We ob&s;erved that the current &s;et exactly for the rock of Scylla, and would infallibly have carried any thing thrown into it again&s;t that point; &s;o that it was not without rea&s;on the ancients have painted it as an ob|ject of &s;uch terror. It is about a mile from the entry of the Faro, and forms a &s;mall promontory, which runs a little out to &s;ea, and meets the whole force of the waters, as they come out of the narrowe&s;t part of the Straits. The head of this promontory is the famous Scylla. It mu&s;t be owned that it does not altogether come up to the formidable de&s;cription that Homer gives of it: the reading of which (like that of Shake|&s;peare's cliff) almo&s;t makes one's head giddy. Nei|ther is the pa&s;&s;age &s;o wondrous narrow and difficult as he makes it. Indeed it is probable that the breadth of it is greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince his time, by the violent impetuo&s;ity of the current. And this violence too mu&s;t have always dimini&s;hed, in proportion as the breadth of the channel increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our pilot &s;ays, there are many &s;mall rocks that &s;hew their heads near the ba&s;e of the large ones. The&s;e are probably the dogs that are de&s;cribed as howling round the mon&s;ter Scylla. There are likewi&s;e many caverns that add greatly to the noi&s;e of the water, and tend &s;till to increa&s;e the horror of the &s;cene. The rock is near 200 feet high. There is a kind of ca&s;tle or fort built on its &s;ummit; and the town of Scylla or Sciglio, con|taining three or four hundred inhabitants, &s;tands on its &s;outh &s;ide, and gives the title of prince to a Calabre&s;e family.</P>
<P>As the current was directly again&s;t us, we were obliged to lie to, for &s;ome hours, 'till it turned. The motion of the water cea&s;ed for &s;ome time, but in a few minutes it began in the oppo&s;ite direction, though not

with &s;uch violence. We lay ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to Cape Pylorus (where the light-hou&s;e is now built.) It is &s;aid to have been thus named by Hannibal, in recom|pen&s;e to Pelorus his pilot, for having put him to death on this &s;pot, on a fal&s;e &s;u&s;picion of his wanting to be|tray him: For &s;eeing him&s;elf land-locked on all &s;ides, he thought there was no e&s;caping, and that Pelorus had been bribed to deliver him up; but as &s;oon he di&s;cov|ered the Straits, he repented of his ra&s;hne&s;s, and &s;ome years afterwards erected a &s;tatue here, in atonement to the manes of Pelorus. Pomponius Mela tells this &s;tory; from whence he draws two very wi&s;e inferences: That Hannibal mu&s;t have been extremely pa&s;&s;ionate: and that he knew nothing at all of geography. Others deny this authority, and &s;ay it was named Pelorus from Uly&s;&s;es's pilot, who was drowned near to this place; but there can be no &s;ort of foundation for this conjecture; for Uly&s;&s;es's whole crew were drowned at the &s;ame time, and he him&s;elf was driven through the&s;e Straits; mounted on the broken ma&s;t of his &s;hip. It is like mo&s;t di&s;putes among&s;t antiquaries, a matter of mighty little con&s;equence; and I leave you at full liberty to chu&s;e which of the two accounts you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From hence we had an opportunity of ob&s;erving a pretty large portion of Calabria, which formerly con|&s;tituted a con&s;iderable part of that celebrated country, known by the name of Great Greece, and looked upon as one of the mo&s;t fertile in the empire. The&s;e beau|tiful hills and mountains are covered with trees and bru&s;hwood to the very &s;ummit; and appear pretty much in the &s;ame &s;tate as &s;ome of the wilds of Ameri|ca, that are ju&s;t beginning to be cultivated. Some little &s;pots where the woods are cleared away, ju&s;t &s;erve to &s;hew the natural fertility of the &s;oil, and what this country might &s;oon be brought to, were indu&s;try and
<PB N="24" REF="024150_0034_0FC3C31BE1047BF0">
population encouraged; but it &s;till remains a good deal in the &s;ame &s;ituation as when the barbarous na|tions left it; and I believe it is hard to &s;ay, whether their tyranny or that of Spain has been the mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ive. After the inva&s;ion of tho&s;e nations, and during the time of the dark and barbarous ages, this country (like many others) from the highe&s;t &s;tate of culture and civilization, became a wild and barren wilderne&s;s, overgrown with thickets and fore&s;ts; and, indeed, &s;ince the revival of arts and agriculture, perhaps of all Europe this is the country that has profited the lea&s;t; retaining &s;till, both in the wildne&s;s of its fields and ferocity of its inhabitants more of the Gothic bar|barity than is to be met with any where el&s;e. Some of the&s;e fore&s;ts are of a va&s;t extent, and ab&s;olutely im|penetrable; and no doubt conceal in their thickets many valuable monuments of its ancient magnifi|cence. Of this indeed we have a very recent proof in the di&s;covery of Pe&s;tum, a Grecian city, that had not been heard of for many ages; 'till of late, &s;ome of its lofty temples were &s;een, peeping over the tops of the woods; upbraiding mankind for their &s;hameful neglect; and calling upon them to bring it once more to light. Accordingly curio&s;ity, and the hopes of gain, a &s;till more powerful motive, &s;oon opened a pa&s;|&s;age, and expo&s;ed to view the&s;e valuable and re&s;pectable relics. But here it would be out of place to give you an account of them; I &s;hall re&s;erve that 'till my return.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our &s;hip entered the current, we were carried along with great velocity towards Me&s;&s;ina, which is twelve miles from the entry of the Straits. However, as the pa&s;&s;age widens in proportion as you advance, the current of con&s;equence becomes le&s;s rapid. At Me&s;&s;ina it is four miles broad. At the mouth

of the &s;traits, betwixt the promontories of Pelorus in Sicily, and the Coda de Volpe (or the Fox's tail) in Calabria, it appears &s;carcely to be a mile. Mo&s;t of the ancient writers are of opinion that Sicily was for|merly joined to the continent in this &s;pot, and that the &s;eparation mu&s;t have been made by &s;ome violent con|vul&s;ion of the earth. If this is true, which indeed does not appear improbable, it mu&s;t have happened far beyond the reach of all hi&s;torians, as none of them, at lea&s;t that I have &s;een, pretend any thing but conjecture for the foundation of their opinion. Indeed Claudian (were credit to be given to poets) &s;ays po&s;itively,
<Q>"Trinacria quondam Italiae pars una fuit."</Q>
And Virgil too, in his third Aeneid, tells the &s;ame &s;tory:
<Q>"Haec loca vi quondam, et va&s;ta convul&s;a ruina, &amp;c."</Q>
Pliny, Strabo, Diodorus, and many others, both hi&s;to|rians and philo&s;ophers, are of the &s;ame &s;entiments, and pretend that the &s;trata in the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Strait perfectly corre&s;pond: Like the white rocks near Do|ver and Bologne, which have given ri&s;e to an opinion of the &s;ame kind. However, the &s;imilarity in that ca&s;e, is much more &s;triking to the eye at lea&s;t than in this.</P>
<P>The approach to Me&s;&s;ina is the fine&s;t that can be imagined; it is not &s;o grand as that of Naples, but it is much more beautiful, and the key exceeds any thing I have ever yet &s;een, even in Holland. It is built in the form of a cre&s;cent, and is &s;urrounded by a range of magnificent buildings, four &s;tories high, and exactly uniform, for the &s;pace of an Italian mile. The &s;treet betwixt the&s;e and the &s;ea is about an hun|dred feet wide, and forms one of the mo&s;t delightful

walks in the world. It enjoys the free&s;t air, and com|mands the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect: It is only expo&s;ed to the morning &s;un, being &s;haded all the re&s;t of the day by the&s;e buildings. It is be&s;ides con&s;tantly re|fre&s;hed by the cooling breeze from the Straits; for the current of the water produces likewi&s;e a current in the air, that renders this one of the coole&s;t habitations in Sicily.</P>
<P>We ca&s;t anchor about four this afternoon, near the center of this enchanted &s;emi-circle, the beauty of which greatly delighted us; but our plea&s;ure was &s;oon inter|rupted by a di&s;covery that the name of one of our &s;er|vants had been omitted in our bills of health; and an a&s;&s;urance from the captain, that if he was di&s;covered we &s;hould certainly be obliged to perform a long quaran|tine. Whil&s;t we were deliberating upon this weighty matter, we ob&s;erved a boat with the people of the health-office approaching us. We had ju&s;t time to get him wrapped up in a hammock, and &s;hut down below the hatches; with orders not to &s;tir in ca&s;e of a &s;earch, and not to appear again above deck 'till he &s;hould be called. The poor fellow was obliged to keep in his hole 'till it was dark, as our con&s;ul and &s;ome people of the health-office &s;tayed on board much longer than we could have wi&s;hed, and we are &s;till obliged to conceal him; for if he be di&s;covered, we &s;hall probably get into a very bad &s;crape. They are particularly &s;trict here in this re&s;pect: and indeed they have great rea&s;on to be &s;o; &s;ince this beautiful city was almo&s;t annihilated by the plague in the year 1743, when upwards of 70,000 people are &s;aid to have died in it and its di&s;trict in the &s;pace of a few months.</P>
<P>We have now got on &s;hore, and are lodged in the mo&s;t wretched of inns; although &s;aid to be a fir&s;t-rate one for Sicily: but we are contented; for &s;urely after

<P>THE harbour of Me&s;&s;ina is formed by a &s;mall promontory or neck of land that runs off from the ea&s;t end of the city, and &s;eparates that beautiful ba&s;on from the re&s;t of the Straits. The &s;hape of this promontory is that of a reaping hook, the curvature of which forms the harbour, and &s;ecures it from all winds. From the &s;triking re&s;emblance of its form, the Greeks who never gave a name that did not either de&s;cribe the object or expre&s;s &s;ome of its mo&s;t remarkable properties, called this place Zancle or the Sickle, and feigned that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">kle of Saturn fell on this &s;pot, and gave it its form. But the Latins, who were not quite &s;o fond of fable, changed its name to Me&s;&s;ina (from <HI>me&s;&s;is,</HI> a harve&s;t) becau&s;e of the great fertility of its fields. It is certainly one of the &s;afe&s;t harbours in the world after &s;hips have got in; but it is likewi&s;e one of the mo&s;t difficult acce&s;s. The celebrated gulf or whirlpool of Charybdis lies near to its entry, and often occa&s;ions &s;uch an inte&s;tine and irregular motion in the water, that the helm lo&s;es

mo&s;t of its power, and &s;hips have great difficulty to get in, even with the faire&s;t wind that can blow. This whirlpool, I think, is probably formed by the &s;mall promontory I have mentioned; which contracting the Straits in this &s;pot, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the velocity of the current; but no doubt other cau&s;es, of which we are ignorant, concur, for this will by no means account for all the appearances which it has produced. The great noi&s;e occa&s;ioned by the tumultuous motion of the waters in this place, made the ancients liken it to a voracious &s;ea-mon&s;ter perpetually roaring for its prey; and it has been repre&s;ented by their authors as the mo&s;t tremendous pa&s;&s;age in the world. Ari&s;totle gives a long and a formidable de&s;cription of it in his 125th chapter De Admirandis, which I find tran&s;lated in an old Sicilian book I have got here.

Lucretius, Ovid, Sallu&s;t, Seneca, as al&s;o by many of the old Italian and Sicilian poets, who all &s;peak of it in terms of horror; and repre&s;ent it as an object that in&s;pired terror, even when looked on at a di&s;tance. It certainly is not now &s;o formidable: and very probably, the violence of this motion, continued for &s;o many ages, has by degrees worn &s;mooth the rugged rocks, and jutting &s;helves, that may have intercepted and confined the waters. The breadth of the Straits too, in this place, I make no doubt is con&s;iderably enlarged. Indeed, from the nature of things it mu&s;t be &s;o; the perpetual friction occa&s;ioned by the current mu&s;t wear away the bank on each &s;ide, and enlarge the bed of water.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els in this pa&s;&s;age were obliged to go as near as po&s;&s;ible to the coa&s;t of Calabria, in order to avoid the &s;uction occa&s;ioned by the whirling of the waters in this vortex; by which means when they came to the narrowe&s;t and mo&s;t rapid part of the Straits, betwixt Cape Pelorus and Scylla, they were in great danger of being carried upon that rock.

<P>The little neck of land, forming the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina, is &s;trongly fortified. The citadel, which is indeed a very fine work, is built on that part which connects it with the main land. The farthermo&s;t point, which runs out to &s;ea, is defended by four &s;mall forts, which command the entry into the harbour. Betwixt the&s;e lie the lazaret, and a light-hou&s;e to warn &s;ailors of their approach to Charybdis, as that other on Cape Pelorus is intended to give them notice of Scylla.</P>
<P>It is probably from the&s;e light-hou&s;es (by the Greeks called Pharoi) that the whole of this celebrated Strait has been denominated the Faro of Me&s;&s;ina.</P>
<P>There are a number of gallies and galliots in this beautiful harbour, which &s;till add greatly to its beauty. Three of the&s;e &s;ailed this morning, in order to cruize round the i&s;land and to protect it from the &s;udden inva&s;ions of the Barbarians, who are often very trouble&s;ome on the &s;outh-coa&s;t. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els made a very picture&s;que appearance as they went out of the harbour; their oars moving all together, with the greate&s;t regularity. I think there are nine or ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en to each oar; and indeed it appears to be the harde&s;t work you can imagine. They all ri&s;e, every &s;troke of the oar, and when they pull, they almo&s;t throw
<PB N="31" REF="024150_0041_0FC3C32D38F9E448">
them&s;elves on their backs, and &s;eem to exert their utmo&s;t force. The&s;e wretches are chained to their oars, and &s;leep every night on the bare benches, without any thing to throw over them. Yet, what is &s;trange, notwith&s;tanding all the mi&s;ery they &s;uffer, I am told there was never known an in&s;tance of any of them putting them&s;elves to death. They often, indeed, confer that favour upon one another, but it is only in their quarrels, and by no means out of kindne&s;s. In a company of Engli&s;h in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, promotion would probably go on much fa&s;ter, as there would be no want of vacancies, provided only ropes and knives were to be had.</P>
<P>We intended this morning to have paid our re&s;pects to the prince of Villa Franca, the governor, and to have delivered our letters; but he is gone to his coun|try hou&s;e, and as there are no carriages to be had, we are obliged to wait his arrival in town, which, will probably be to-morrow or next day.</P>
<P>We are &s;till under a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s about our &s;ervant, and are obliged to conceal him carefully from the people of the health-office, who &s;eem to haunt us, as we have met them this morning in all our walks. Were he to be di&s;covered, perhaps &s;ome of us might have the plea&s;ure of making a little voyage, on board one of tho&s;e gallies, for our amu&s;ement. Indeed the captain of the &s;hip, poor fellow, would run the greate&s;t ri&s;k, who is obliged to an&s;wer for every per&s;on on board.&mdash;We &s;hall leave this place as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for I do not believe there is much more to be &s;een about it.</P>
<P>20th at night. After dinner our depute-con&s;ul (a Sicilian) carried us to &s;everal convents, where we were
<PB N="32" REF="024150_0042_0FC3C32E64AE9448">
received by the nuns with great politene&s;s and affability. We conver&s;ed with them for &s;ome hours through the grate, and found &s;ome of them by no means deficient, either in point of knowledge or &s;prightline&s;s; but none of them had &s;incerity enough (which we met with in Portugal more than once) to acknowledge the unhappi|ne&s;s of their &s;ituation. All pretended to be happy and contented, and declared they would not change their pri&s;on for the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ituation in life. However, &s;ome of them had a &s;oft melancholy in their countenances, that gave the lie to their words; and I am per&s;uaded, in a t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te, and on a more intimate acquaintance, they would have told a very different &s;tory. Several of them are extremely hand&s;ome; but, indeed, I think, they always appear &s;o; and am very certain, from frequent experience, that there is no artificial ornament, or &s;tudied embelli&s;hment whatever, that can produce half &s;o &s;trong an effect, as the mode&s;t and &s;imple attire of a pretty young nun, placed behind a double iron grate. To &s;ee an amiable, unaffected, and unadorned per&s;on, that might have been an honour and an ornament to &s;ociety, make a voluntary re&s;igna|tion of her charms, and give up the world and all its plea&s;ures, for a life of fa&s;ting and mortification, it cannot fail to move our pity;
<Q>"And pity melts the mind to love."</Q>
There is another con&s;ideration which tends much to increa&s;e the&s;e feelings; that is, our total incapacity ever to alter her &s;ituation. The plea&s;ure of relieving an object in di&s;tre&s;s, is the only refuge we have again&s;t the pain which the &s;eeing of that object occa&s;ions; but here, this is utterly denied us, and we feel with &s;orrow, that pity is all we can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and the like reflections, a man gener|ally
<PB N="33" REF="024150_0043_0FC3C330271A44E8">
feels him&s;elf in bad &s;pirits after conver&s;ing with amiable nuns. Indeed, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, without a heavy heart, to leave the grate; that inexorable and impenetrable barrier.&mdash;At la&s;t we took our leave, expre&s;&s;ing our happine&s;s, in being admitted &s;o near them; but at the &s;ame time deploring our mi&s;ery, in &s;eeing them for ever removed at &s;o unmea&s;urable a di&s;tance from us. They were much plea&s;ed with our vi&s;it, and begged we would repeat it every day during our &s;tay at Me&s;&s;ina; but this might prove dangerous.</P>
<P>On leaving the convent, we ob&s;erved a great con|cour&s;e of people on the top of a high hill, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city. The con&s;ul told us, it was the celebration of a great fe&s;tival in honour of St. Francis, and was worth our going to &s;ee. Accordingly, we arrived ju&s;t as the &s;aint made his appearance. He was carried through the crowd with va&s;t ceremony, and received the homage of the people with a becoming dignity; after which he was again lodged in his chapel, where he performs a number of miracles every day, to all tho&s;e who have abundance of money and abundance of faith. His mini&s;ters, however, are only a &s;et of poor grea&s;y capuchins; who indeed do not &s;eem to have enriched them&s;elves in his &s;ervice. In general, he is but a &s;habby ma&s;ter if one may judge by the tattered cloaths of his &s;ervants; and St. Benedict, who does not pretend to half his &s;anctity, beats him all to nothing. The people continued to dance, in &s;oft Sicilian mea&s;ures, 'till after &s;un-&s;et, when they retired. Many of the country girls are extremely hand&s;ome, and dance with a good grace. The young fellows were all in their &s;unday's cloaths, and made a good appearance. The a&s;&s;embly room was a fine green plain on the top of the hill. It plea&s;ed us very much, and put us in mind of &s;ome of Theocritus's de&s;criptions of the Sicilian
<PB N="34" REF="024150_0044_0FC3C3369BC5F470">
plea&s;ures. But Theocritus, if he could have rai&s;ed up his head, would probably have been a good deal puzzled what to make of the &s;habby figure of St. Francis, marching through among&s;t them with &s;uch maje&s;ty and &s;olemnity. Another part of the ceremony too would have greatly alarmed him, as indeed it did us. The whole court before the church was &s;urrounded with a triple row of &s;mall iron cannon, about &s;ix inch|es long; the&s;e were charged to the muzzle, and ram|med very hard; after which they were &s;et clo&s;e to each other, and a train laid, that completed the commu|nication through the whole number, which mu&s;t have exceeded 2000. Fire was &s;et to the train, and in two or three minutes, the whole was di&s;charged, by a run|ning fire; the reports following one another &s;o quick, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the ear to &s;eparate them. The effect was very grand; but it would have been nothing without the fine echo from the high mountains on each &s;ide of the Straits, which prolonged the &s;ound for &s;ome con&s;iderable time after the firing was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The view from the top of this hill, is beautiful be|yond de&s;cription. The Straits appear like a va&s;t ma|je&s;tic river, flowing &s;lowly betwixt two ridges of mountains, and opening by degrees from its narrowe&s;t point, 'till it &s;wells to the &s;ize of an ocean. Its banks, at the &s;ame time, adorned with rich corn-fields, vine|yards, orchards, towns, villages, and churches. The pro&s;pect is terminated on each &s;ide by the tops of high mountains covered with wood.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved in our walks to-day, many of the flow|ers that are much e&s;teemed in our gardens, and others too that we are not acquainted with. Lark&s;pur, flos Adonis, Venus' looking-gla&s;s, hawk&s;weed, and very fine lupins grow wild over all the&s;e mountains. They
<PB N="35" REF="024150_0045_0FC3C3385CDDA600">
have likewi&s;e a variety of flowering &s;hrubs; particu|larly one in great plenty, which I do not recollect ever to have &s;een before: It appears a beautiful round fruit, of a bright &s;hining yellow. They call it, Il pomo d'oro, or golden apple. All the fields about Me&s;&s;ina are covered with the riche&s;t white clover, intermixed with a variety of aromatic plants, which perfume the air, and render their walks exceedingly delightful. But what is remarkable, we were mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of this per|fume, when walking on the harbour which is at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the&s;e fields. I mentioned this peculiarity to a Me&s;&s;ine&s;e gentleman, who tells me, that the &s;alt produced here by the heat of the &s;un, emits a grateful odour, &s;omething like violets; and it is that, probably, which perfumes the &s;ea-&s;hore. On con&s;ult|ing Fazzello De rebus Siculis, I find he takes notice of the &s;ame &s;ingularity; and likewi&s;e ob&s;erves, that the water of the Straits has a vi&s;cous or glutinous quality, which by degrees cements the &s;and and gravel togeth|er, and at la&s;t con&s;olidates them to the &s;olidity of rock.</P>
<P>There are fine &s;hady walks on all &s;ides of Me&s;&s;ina; &s;ome of the&s;e run along the &s;ea-&s;hore, and are for ever fanned by the cooling breeze from the Straits. The hou&s;es are large, and mo&s;t of the articles of life are cheap and in plenty; particularly fi&s;h which are reckoned better here, than any where el&s;e in the Mediterranean. The hire of lodgings is next to nothing; almo&s;t one half of that noble range of build|ings I have de&s;cribed, being ab&s;olutely uninhabited &s;ince the de&s;olation of 1743; &s;o that the proprietors are glad to get tenants on any terms. It now occurs to me, that from all the&s;e con&s;iderations, there is no place I have &s;een, &s;o admirably calculated for the re&s;i|dence of that flock of valetudinarians, which every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utumn leave our country with the &s;wallows, in &s;earch
<PB N="36" REF="024150_0046_0FC3C3398F4531E8">
of warm climates. I have been inquiring with regard to their winter &s;ea&s;on, and find all agree, that, in gen|eral, it is much preferable to that of Naples. They allow they have &s;ometimes heavy rain for two or three weeks; but it never la&s;ts longer: And be&s;ides, they have always &s;ome fair hours every day, when people can go out for exerci&s;e; for the moment the rain is over, the walks are dry, the &s;oil being a light gravel.</P>
<P>The advantages of Me&s;&s;ina over Naples in other re&s;pects, I think, are con&s;iderable. At Naples there are no walks; and, the truth is, they have no occa&s;ion for them, no more indeed than they have for legs; for you know as well as I, that walking there, is little le&s;s infamous than &s;tealing; and any per&s;on that makes u&s;e of his limbs is looked upon as a blackguard, and de&s;pi|&s;ed by all-good company. The rides too are all at a great di&s;tance; and you are obliged to go &s;ome miles on &s;treets and pavement before you get into the coun|try; be&s;ides pa&s;&s;ing the vile grotto of Pau&s;illipe, where you are in danger of being blinded, and &s;tifled with du&s;t. There are &s;eldom any public diver&s;ions here; the attending of which at Naples, and complying with their bad hours, does often more than counteract all the benefit obtained from the climate. That dete&s;table practice of gaming too, is by no means &s;o prevalent here; which from the anxiety it occa&s;ions to the mind, and la&s;&s;itude to the body, mu&s;t be death to all hectic people, weak brea&s;ts, or delicate nerves. I could &s;ay much more on this &s;ubject, but as I have many of the&s;e circum&s;tances only from the report of the inhabi|tants, it makes me more diffident, than if I had known them from my own experience.</P>
<P>We found our banker, Mr. M&mdash;, a very &s;en&s;ible man, and &s;pent &s;ome hours with him, both this morning
<PB N="37" REF="024150_0047_0FC3C33B24D42578">
and evening, very agreeably. He has given us &s;ome account of the police of the country, the mo&s;t &s;ingular, perhaps, of any in the world, to &s;uch a degree, indeed, that I &s;hall not venture to tell it you, 'till I have talked it over with &s;ome other people, to &s;ee if the accounts agree;&mdash;though from the character that gentleman bears, both here and at Naples, he is as good authority as any in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The prince of Villa Franca is arrived: &s;o that we &s;hall probably have our audience to-morrow morning. Adieu&mdash;We are ju&s;t going to &s;up upon &s;teaks made of the pe&s;ce &s;pada or &s;word-fi&s;h, which are caught in great plenty in the&s;e &s;eas. The &s;word of this one, is upwards of four feet long; and a formidable weapon it is;&mdash;not unlike a Highland bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;word. This fi&s;h, when cut, bears a perfect re&s;emblance to fle&s;h; &s;o much, that none of us doubted it was beef-&s;teaks they were dre&s;&s;ing for us, and expre&s;&s;ed our &s;urpri&s;e at finding that di&s;h in Sicily.&mdash;Good night.</P>

<P>WE are ju&s;t returned from the prince's. He received us politely, but with a good deal of &s;tate. He offered us the u&s;e of his carriages, as there are none to be hired; and, in the u&s;ual &s;tile, de&s;ired to know in what he could be of &s;ervice to us.. We told him (with an apology for our abrupt departure) that we were obliged to &s;et off to-morrow, and begged his pro|tection on our journey. He replied, that he would give orders for guards to attend us, that &s;hould be an&s;werable for every thing; that we need give our&s;elves no farther trouble; that whatever number of mules we had occa&s;ion for, &s;hould be ready at the door of the inn,
<PB N="38" REF="024150_0048_0FC3C33CE2E10038">
at any hour we &s;hould think proper to appoint: He added, that we might entirely rely on tho&s;e guards, who were people of the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution, as well as of the mo&s;t approved fidelity, and would not fail to cha&s;ti&s;e on the &s;pot, any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e upon us.</P>
<P>Now, who do you think the&s;e tru&s;ty guards are compo&s;ed of? Why, of the mo&s;t daring, and mo&s;t hardened villains, perhaps, that are to be met with upon earth, who, in any other country, would have been broken upon the wheel, or hung in chains; but are here publicly protected, and univer&s;ally feared and re&s;pected. It was this part of the police of Sicily, that I was afraid to give you an account of: But I have now conver&s;ed with the prince's people on the &s;ubject, and they have confirmed every circum&s;tance Mr. M&mdash;made me acquainted with.</P>
<P>He told me, that in this ea&s;t part of the i&s;land called Val Demoni, (from the devils that are &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit mount Aetna) it has ever been found impracti|cable to extirpate the banditti; there being numberle&s;s caverns and &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages in that mountain, where no troops could po&s;&s;ibly pur&s;ue them: that be&s;ides, as they are known to be perfectly determined and re&s;olute, never failing to take a dreadful revenge on all who have offended them, the prince of Villa Franca has embraced it, not only as the &s;afe&s;t, but likewi&s;e as the wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t political &s;cheme, to become their declared patron and protector. And &s;uch of them as think proper to leave their mountains and fore&s;ts, though perhaps only for a time, are &s;ure to meet with good encouragement, and &s;ecurity in his &s;ervice; they enjoy the mo&s;t unbounded confidence, which, in no in&s;tance, they have ever yet been found to make an improper or a
<PB N="39" REF="024150_0049_0FC3C33E2C2B6F20">
di&s;hone&s;t u&s;e of. They are clothed in the prince's livery, yellow and green, with &s;ilver lace; and wear likewi&s;e a badge of their honourable order, which entitles them to univer&s;al fear and re&s;pect from the people.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t been interrupted by an upper &s;ervant of the prince's, who both by his looks and language, &s;eems to be of the &s;ame worthy fraternity. He tells us, that he has ordered our muleteers, at their peril, to be ready by day-break; but that we need not go 'till we think proper; for it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to attend on <HI>no&s;tri eccellenzi.</HI> He &s;ays he has likewi&s;e ordered two of the mo&s;t de&s;perate fellows in the whole i&s;land to accom|pany us; adding, in a &s;ort of whi&s;per, that we need be under no apprehen&s;ion; for if any per&s;on &s;hould pre|&s;ume to impo&s;e upon us to the value of a &s;ingle baiocc, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall coin.</NOTE> they would certainly put them to death. I gave him an ounce, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">About eleven &s;hillings.</NOTE> which I knew was what he expected; on which he redoubled his bows and his eccellenzis, and declared we were the mo&s;t <HI>honorabili Signori</HI> he had ever met with, and that if we plea&s;ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf &s;hould have the honour of attending us, and would cha&s;ti&s;e any per&s;on that &s;hould dare take the wall of us, or injure us in the &s;malle&s;t trifle. We thanked him for his zeal, &s;hewing him we had &s;words of our own. On which, bowing re&s;pectfully, he retired.</P>
<P>I can now, with more a&s;&s;urance, give you &s;ome account of the conver&s;ation I had with Seignior M&mdash;, who as I &s;aid appears to be a very intelligent man, and has re&s;ided here, for the&s;e many years.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, that in &s;ome circum&s;tances the&s;e banditti are the mo&s;t re&s;pectable people of the i&s;land; and have
<PB N="40" REF="024150_0050_0FC3C33FC1009B68">
by much the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t romantic notions of what they call their point of honour. That however criminal they may be with regard to &s;ociety in general, yet, with re&s;pect to one another, and to every per&s;on to whom they have once profe&s;&s;ed it, they have ever maintained the mo&s;t un&s;haken fidelity. The magi|&s;trates have often been obliged to protect them, and even pay them court, as they are known to be perfectly determined, and de&s;perate; and &s;o extremely vindictive, that they will certainly put any per&s;on to death, who has ever given them ju&s;t cau&s;e of provocation. On the other hand, it never was known that any per&s;on who had put him&s;elf under their protection, and &s;hewed that he had confidence in them, had cau&s;e to repent of it, or was injured by any of them, in the mo&s;t minute trifle; but on the contrary, they will protect him from impo&s;itions of every kind, and &s;corn to go halves with the landlord, like mo&s;t other conductors and traveling &s;ervants; and will defend him with their lives, if there is occa&s;ion. That tho&s;e of their number, who have thus enli&s;ted them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of &s;ociety, are known and re&s;pected by the other banditti all over the i&s;land; and the per&s;ons of tho&s;e they accompany are ever held &s;acred. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, mo&s;t travellers chu&s;e to hire a couple of them from town to town; and may thus travel over the whole i&s;land in &s;afety. To illu&s;trate their character the more, he added two &s;tories, which happened but a few days ago, and are &s;till in every body's mouth:</P>
<P>A number of people were found digging in a place where &s;ome trea&s;ure was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been hid during the plague: As this had been forbid under the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties, they were immediately carried to pri&s;on, and expected to have been treated without mercy; but, luckily for the others, one of the&s;e heroes
<PB N="41" REF="024150_0051_0FC3C34153AD5E68">
happened to be of the number. He wrote to the Prince of Villa Franca, and made u&s;e of &s;uch powerful arguments in their favour, that they were all immedi|ately &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>This will &s;erve to &s;hew their con&s;equence with the civil power; the other &s;tory will give you a &s;trong idea of their barbarous ferocity, and the horrid mixture of &s;tubborn vice and virtue (if I may call it by that name) that &s;eems to direct their actions. I &s;hould have mentioned, that they have a practice of borrowing money from the country people, who never dare refu&s;e them; and if they promi&s;e to pay it, they have ever been found punctual and exact, both as to the time and the &s;um; and would much rather rob and murder an innocent per&s;on, than fail of payment at the day appoint|ed: And this they have often been obliged to do, only in order (as they &s;ay) to fulfil their engagements, and to &s;ave their honour.</P>
<P>It happened within this fortnight, that the brother of one of the&s;e heroic banditti having occa&s;ion for money, and not knowing how to procure it, determined to make u&s;e of his brother's name and authority, an artifice which he thought could not ea&s;ily be di&s;covered; accordingly he went to a country prie&s;t, and told him his brother had occa&s;ion for twenty ducats which he de&s;ired he would immediately lend him. The prie&s;t a&s;&s;ured him that he had not then &s;o large a &s;um, but that if he would return in a few days it &s;hould be ready for him. The other replied, that he was afraid to return to his brother with this an&s;wer; and de&s;ired, that he would by all means take care to keep out of his way, at lea&s;t 'till &s;uch time as he had pacified him; other|wi&s;e he could not be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences. As bad fortune would have it, the very next day the
<PB N="42" REF="024150_0052_0FC3C342CDDB41A8">
prie&s;t and the robber met in a narrow road: the former fell a trembling, as the latter approached, and at la&s;t dropped on his knees to beg for mercy. The robber, a&s;toni&s;hed at his behaviour, de&s;ired to know the cau&s;e of it. The trembling prie&s;t an&s;wered, "Il denaro, il denaro," the money, the money&mdash;but &s;end your brother to-morrow, and you &s;hall have it. The haughty robber a&s;&s;ured him, that he di&s;dained taking money of a poor prie&s;t; adding, that if any of his brothers had been low enough to make &s;uch a demand, he him&s;elf was ready to advance the &s;um. The prie&s;t then acquainted him with the vi&s;it he had received the preceding night from his brother, by his order; a&s;&s;uring him, that if he had been ma&s;ter of the &s;um, he &s;hould immediately have &s;upplied it. Well, &s;ays the robber, I will now convince you whether my brother or I are mo&s;t to be believed; you &s;hall go with me to his hou&s;e, which is but a few miles di&s;tant. On their arrival before the door, the robber called on his brother, who never &s;u&s;pecting the di&s;covery, immediately came to the balcony; but on perceiving the prie&s;t he began to make excu&s;es for his conduct. The robber told him, there was no excu&s;e to be made; that he only de&s;ired to know the fact, Whether he had gone to borrow money of that prie&s;t in his name or not?

account of our journey. In the mean time, adieu. We are going to take a look of the churches and public buildings; but with the&s;e I &s;hall trouble you very little.</P>
<P>21&s;t at night. We have been very well entertained, both from what we have &s;een and heard. We u&s;ed to admire the dexterity of &s;ome of the divers at Naples, when they went to the depth of forty eight or fifty feet, and could not conceive how a man could remain three minutes under water without drawing breath; but the&s;e are nothing to the feats of one Colas, a native of this place, who is &s;aid to have lived for &s;everal days in the &s;ea, without coming to land; and from thence got the &s;irname of Pe&s;ce, or the fi&s;h. Some of the Sicilian authors affirm, that he caught fi&s;h merely by his agility in the water; and the credulous Kircher a&s;&s;erts, that he could walk acro&s;s the Straits at the bottom of the &s;ea. Be that as it will, he was &s;o much celebrated for &s;wim|ming and diving, that one of their kings (Frederick) came on purpo&s;e to &s;ee him perform: which royal vi&s;it proved fatal to poor Pe&s;ce; for the king, after admiring his wonderful force and agility, had the cruelty to propo&s;e his diving near the gulph of Charybdis; and to tempt him the more, threw in a large golden cup, which was to be his prize &s;hould he bring it up. Pe&s;ce made two attempts, and a&s;toni&s;hed the &s;pectators by the time he remained under water; but in the third, it is thought he was caught by the whirlpool, as he never appeared more; and his body is &s;aid to have been found &s;ome time afterwards near Taurominum (about thirty miles di&s;tant) it having been ob&s;erved, that what is &s;wallowed up by Charybdis is carried &s;outh by the current, and thrown out upon that coa&s;t. On the contrary nothing wrecked here was ever carried through the Straits, or thrown out on the north &s;ide of Sicily,
<PB N="44" REF="024150_0054_0FC3C3458EF99670">
unle&s;s we believe what Homer &s;ays of the &s;hip of Uly&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We have been again to take a view of the Straits at this famous whirlpool, and are more and more con|vinced, that it mu&s;t be infinitely dimini&s;hed; indeed, in compari&s;on of what it was, almo&s;t reduced to nothing. The &s;ea appeared to have no extraordinary motion there, and &s;hips and boats &s;eemed to pa&s;s it with ea&s;e. When we compare this its pre&s;ent &s;tate, with the formidable de&s;cription of &s;o many ancient authors, poets, hi&s;torians, and philo&s;ophers, it appears indeed not improbable that this i&s;land has been torn from the continent by &s;ome violent convul&s;ion, and that near to this &s;pot, huge caverns have been opened, which, drink|ing in the waters in one cour&s;e of the current, and throwing them out in the other, may perhaps in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the phaenomena of Charybdis. I find it is de&s;cribed both by Homer and Virgil, as alter|natively &s;wallowed up, and throwing out every object that approached it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Dextrum Scylla latus, laevum implacata Charybdis</L>

I own I am not quite &s;atisfied with this &s;olution, but at pre&s;ent I cannot think of a better: The fact, however, is certain, that it mu&s;t have been a dreadful object even in Virgil's time, el&s;e he never would have made Aeneas and his fleet perceive its effects at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and immediately run out to &s;ea to avoid it; nor would he have made Helenus

at &s;uch pains to caution him again&s;t that dangerous gulf, and advi&s;e him rather to make the whole tour of Sicily than attempt to pa&s;s it.

Some of the churches are hand&s;ome, and there are a few tolerable paintings. One ceremony, from the account they give of it, I &s;hould like much to have &s;een: The celebration of the fea&s;t of the Vara. It appears, indeed, to be a very &s;ingular exhibition, and I am heartily &s;orry it does not happen at this &s;eason. In order to the more dignified appearance of the Virgin Mary on this occa&s;ion, they have invented a very curi|ous machine, which I am told repre&s;ents heaven, or at lea&s;t a part of it. It is of a huge &s;ize, and move thro' the &s;treet with va&s;t pomp and ceremony. In the centre is the principal figure, which repre&s;ents the Virgin; and, a little higher, there are three others to denote the Trinity. Round the&s;e, are a number of wheels, &s;aid to be of a very curious con&s;truction. Ev|ery wheel contains a legion of angels, according to their different degrees of precedency; &s;eraphims, che|rubims, and powers. The&s;e are repre&s;ented by a great number of beautiful little children, all glittering in clothes of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue; with wings of painted feathers fixed to their &s;houlders. When the machine is &s;et in motion, all the&s;e wheels move round, and the different choirs of angels continue in a con&s;tant flutter, &s;inging hallelujahs round the Trinity and the Virgin during the whole of the proce&s;&s;ion, and are &s;aid to make a mo&s;t beautiful appearance. This is all I could learn of this &s;ingular &s;hew, neither were we admitted to &s;ee the machine; con&s;cious, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the ridicule of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible, they did not chu&s;e to unveil &s;o &s;acred an object to the eyes of heretics.&mdash;This i&s;land has ever been famous for the celebration of its fea&s;ts, even in ancient as well as modern times. They &s;pare no expen&s;e; and as they have a large &s;hare both of &s;uper&s;tition and invention, they never fail to produce &s;omething either very fine, or very ridiculous. The fea&s;t of St. Ro&s;olia at Palermo is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t &s;hew in Europe, and
<PB N="47" REF="024150_0057_0FC3C34B9BF0C178">
co&s;ts that city every year a large &s;um. They a&s;&s;ure us there is more ta&s;te and magnificence di&s;played in it, than in any thing of the kind in Italy; and advi&s;e us by all means to attend it, as it happens &s;ome time near the middle of &s;ummer, when we &s;hall probably be in that end of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e we &s;hall now take leave of Me&s;&s;ina;&mdash;I did not expect to make &s;o much out of it. But it would not be fair neither; without at lea&s;t putting you in mind of the great veneration it has ever been held in by the re&s;t of Sicily, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it gave to Count Rugiero in freeing the i&s;land from the yoke of the Saracens; in con&s;ideration of which, great privile|ges were granted it by the &s;ucceeding kings; &s;ome of which are &s;aid &s;till to remain. It was here that the Normans landed; and this city, by the policy of &s;ome of its own inhabitants, was the fir&s;t conque&s;t they made; after which their victorious arms were &s;oon ex|tended over the whole i&s;land; and a final period put to the Saracen tyranny. Count Rugiero fixed the &s;eat of government at Palermo; and put the political &s;y&s;tem of the i&s;land upon a &s;olid ba&s;is; of which the form (and the form alone) &s;till remains to this day. He divided the whole i&s;land into three parts: one he gave to his officers, another to the church, and a third he re|&s;erved for him&s;elf. Of the&s;e three branches he com|po&s;ed his parliament, that re&s;pectable body, of which the &s;keleton only now exi&s;ts; for it has long ago lo&s;t all its blood, nerves, and animal &s;pirits; and for many ages pa&s;t has been reduced to a perfect caput mortuum. The &s;uper&s;titious tyranny of Spain has not only de&s;troy|ed the national &s;pirit of its own inhabitants, but likewi&s;e that of every other country which has fallen under its power. Adieu.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Apropos! There is one thing I had almo&s;t forgot, and I never &s;hould have forgiven my&s;elf. Do you know, the mo&s;t extraordinary phaenomenon in the world is often ob&s;erved near to this place? I laughed at it at fir&s;t, as you will do; but I am now convinced of its reality; and am per&s;uaded too, that if ever it had been thoroughly examined by a philo&s;ophi|cal eye, the natural cau&s;e mu&s;t long ago have been a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, both by the ancients and moderns, that in the heat of &s;ummer, after the &s;ea and air have been much agitated by winds, and a perfect calm &s;ucceeds, there appears, about the time of dawn, in that part of the heavens over the Straits, a great variety of &s;ingular forms, &s;ome at re&s;t and &s;ome mov|ing about with great velocity. The&s;e forms, in proportion as the light increa&s;es, &s;eem to become more aerial; 'till at la&s;t, &s;ome time before &s;un-ri&s;e, they entirely di&s;ap|pear.</P>
<P>The Sicilians repre&s;ent this as the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ight in nature; Leanti, one of their late&s;t and be&s;t writers, came here on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it: He &s;ays, the heavens appear crowned with a variety of objects: He mentions palaces, woods, gardens, &amp;c. be&s;ides the figures of men, and other animals, that appear in mo|tion among&s;t them. No doubt the imagination mu&s;t be greatly aiding, in forming this aerial creation; but as &s;o many of their authors, both ancient and mod|ern, agree in the fact, and give an account of it from their own ob&s;ervation, there certainly mu&s;t be &s;ome foundation for the &s;tory. There is one Giardina, a Je&s;uit, who has lately written a treati&s;e on this phae|nomenon, but I have not been able to find it. The celebrated Me&s;&s;ine&s;e Gallo has likewi&s;e publi&s;hed
<PB N="49" REF="024150_0059_0FC3C356C5D31E90">
&s;omething on this &s;ingular &s;ubject; if I can procure either of them in the i&s;land, you &s;hall have a more perfect account of it. The common people, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, give the whole merit to the devil; and indeed it is by much the &s;horte&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way of ac|counting for it: Tho&s;e who pretend to be philo&s;ophers, and refu&s;e him this honour, are greatly puzzled what to make of it. They think it may be owing to &s;ome uncommon refraction, or reflection of the rays, from the water of the Straits; which, as it is at that time carried about in a variety of eddies and vortexes, mu&s;t con&s;e|quently, &s;ay they, make a variety of appearances on any medium where it is reflected. This, I think, is non|&s;en&s;e; or at lea&s;t very near it; and 'till they can &s;ay more to the purpo&s;e, I think they had much better have left it in the hands of the old gentleman. I &s;u&s;pect it is &s;omething in the nature of our Aurora Borealis; and like many of the great phaenomena of nature, de|pends upon electrical cau&s;es; which, in future ages, I have little doubt, will be found to be as powerful an agent in regulating the univer&s;e, as gravity is in this age, or as the &s;ubtle fluid was in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The electrical fluid, in this country of volcanos, is probably produced in much greater quantity than in any other. The air &s;trongly impregnated with his matter, and confined betwixt two ridges of mountains; at the &s;ame time exceedingly agitated from below, by the violence of the current, and the impetuous whirling of the waters; may it not be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce a variety of appearances? And may not the lively Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> imaginations, animated by a belief in daemons, and all the wild offspring of &s;uper&s;tition, give the&s;e appearances as great a variety of forms? Remember, I do not &s;ay it is &s;o; and hope yet to have it in my power to give you a better account of this matter. However, if you

&s;hould &s;uppo&s;e me in this &s;tory, or in any future one I may tell you, to be inclined to the fabulous, you will plea&s;e to remember, that I am now in the country of fable; this i&s;land having given ri&s;e to more perhaps, except Greece, than all the world be&s;ide. You have, therefore, only to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e regions are &s;till contagious; and call to mind that mount Aetna has ever been the great mother of mon&s;ters and chimeras both in the ancient and the modern world. However, I &s;hall, if po&s;&s;ible, keep free of the infection, and entertain you only with &s;uch &s;ubjects as fall under my own ob&s;ervation. But indeed, from what I have already heard of that wonderful mountain, the mo&s;t moderate account of it would appear highly fabulous to all &s;uch as are unacquainted with objects of this kind. Adieu. We think of &s;etting off to-morrow by day-break. I am &s;orry it has not been a &s;torm, that we might have had a chance of &s;eeing Pandemonium reared over heads, and all the devils at work around it.</P>

<P>WE have had a delightful journey, and if all Sicily be but as agreeable, we &s;hall not repent of our expedition. We left Me&s;&s;ina early this morning, with &s;ix mules for our&s;elves and &s;ervants, and two for our baggage. This train, I a&s;&s;ure you, makes no con|temptible

appearance; particularly when you call to mind our front and rear guard; by much the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of it. The&s;e are two great draw-can&s;ir figures, armed cap-a-pie, with a broad hanger, two enormous pi&s;tols, and a long arq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ebu&s;e: This they kept cocked and ready for action in all &s;u&s;picious places; where they recounted abundances of wonderful &s;tories of robberies and murders; &s;ome of them with &s;uch very minute circum&s;tances, that I am fully per|&s;uaded they them&s;elves were the principal actors. However, I look upon our &s;ituation as perfectly &s;ecure; they pay us great re&s;pect, and take the utmo&s;t pains that we &s;hall not be impo&s;ed upon. Indeed, I think they impo&s;e upon every body except us; for they tax the bills according to their plea&s;ure; and &s;uch cheap ones I never paid before. To-day's dinner for eleven men (our three muleteers included) and feeding for ten mules and hor&s;es, did not amount to half a guinea. And, although we pay them high, (an ounce a day each) yet I am per&s;uaded they &s;ave us at lea&s;t one half of it on our bills. They entertained us with &s;ome of their &s;eats, and make no &s;cruple of owning their having put &s;everal people to death; but add, <Q>Mas tutti tutti honorabilmente,</Q>&mdash;That is to &s;ay, they did not do it in a da&s;tardly manner, nor without ju&s;t provocation.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-coa&s;t of Sicily is very rich; the &s;ides of &s;ome of the mountains are highly cultivated, and pre&s;ent the mo&s;t agreeable a&s;pect that can be imagined; corn, wine, oil, and &s;ilk, all mixed together, and in the great|e&s;t abundance: However, the cultivated part is but &s;mall in proportion to what is lying wa&s;te, and only &s;erves to &s;hew the great fertility of this i&s;land, were it peopled, and in indu&s;trious hands. The &s;ides of the road are covered with a variety of flowers and of flowering &s;hrubs; &s;ome of them exceedingly beautiful.
<PB N="52" REF="024150_0062_0FC3C35B6A82ACD8">
The inclo&s;ures are many of them fenced with hedges of the Indian fig, or prickly pear, as in Spain and Por|tugal; and our guides a&s;&s;ure us, that in many of the parched ravines round Aetna, there are plenty of trees which produce both cinnamon and pepper; not &s;o &s;trong, they allow, as tho&s;e of the &s;pice i&s;lands, but which are &s;old to the merchants at a low price, by a &s;et of banditti, who dre&s;s them&s;elves like hermits: The&s;e &s;pices are mixed with the true pepper and cinnamon from the Indies, and &s;ent over all Europe.</P>
<P>The road from Me&s;&s;ina to this place is extremely romantic. It lies the whole way along the coa&s;t, and commands the view of Calabria, and the &s;outh part of the Straits; covered with chebecks, galleys, galliots, and a quantity of fi&s;hing boats. The view on the right hand is confined by high mountains, on the very &s;ummits of which they have built &s;everal con&s;iderable towns and villages, which with their churches &amp; &s;teeples, make a very picture&s;que appearance. They have cho&s;en this elevated &s;ituation, I &s;uppo&s;e, with a double view; to protect them both from their enemies, and from the violent heat of the climate. This forenoon we found it exce&s;&s;ive, but had the fine&s;t &s;wimming in the world before dinner; which kept us cool and fre&s;h for all the re&s;t of the day. We have be&s;ides provided our&s;elves with umbrellas, without which, at this &s;ea&s;on, traveling would be impracticable.</P>
<P>Betwixt this place and Me&s;&s;ina, a little to the right, lie the mountains, formerly called the Nebrodes; and likewi&s;e the mountain of Neptune, which is reckoned the highe&s;t of that chain. It is celebrated for a gulph or crater on its &s;ummit, from whence, at particular times, there i&s;&s;ues an exceeding cold wind, with &s;uch violence that it is difficult to approach it. I was &s;or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y
<PB N="53" REF="024150_0063_0FC3C35D0A644B28">
to pa&s;s this &s;ingular mountain, but it would have delay|ed us a day or two to vi&s;it it; and we are ha&s;tening with impatience to a much greater object; It is now named Il monte Scuderio, and is &s;aid to be &s;o high that the Adriatic can be &s;een from its &s;ummit. From the de&s;cription they give of it, it appears evidently to be an old volcano. The Ni&s;&s;o takes its ri&s;e from this mountain; a river renowned in antiquity for the gold found in its channel; for which rea&s;on, it was by the Greeks called Chry&s;othoas. It is &s;aid, the remains of the ancient gold mines are &s;till to be &s;oen near the &s;ource of this river; but the modern ma&s;ters of Sicily have never been enterpri&s;ing enough to explore them. It was on this charming coa&s;t, where the flocks of Apollo were kept by his daughters, Phaethu&s;a and Lampetie; the &s;eizing of which by Uly&s;&s;es' compan|ions, proved the cau&s;e of their deaths, and of all his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes. The mountain of Tauromina is very high and &s;teep, and the road up to it is exceed|ingly rugged.</P>
<P>This once famous city is now reduced to an in&s;ig|nificant burgh; yet even the&s;e &s;mall remains give a high idea of its former magnificence. The theatre, I think, is accounted the large&s;t in the world. It appears to me greatly &s;uperior to that of Adrian's villa, near Rome. It is entire enough, to give a very toler|able idea of the Roman theatre, and indeed a&s;toni&s;hes by its va&s;tne&s;s; nor can I conceive how any voice could extend through the prodigious number of people it mu&s;t have contained. I paced about one quarter of it; over the boxes that were intended for the women, which is not near the outward circle of all; the re&s;t is &s;o broken, that I could get no farther. It mea&s;ured about 120 ordinary &s;teps, &s;o that you may conceive the greatne&s;s of the whole. The &s;eats front mount Aetna,
<PB N="54" REF="024150_0064_0FC3C35E8B6ACE48">
which makes a glorious appearance from this place; and no doubt has often diverted their attention from the &s;cene. It ari&s;es from an immen&s;e ba&s;e, and mounts equally on all &s;ides to its &s;ummit: It is ju&s;t now throw|ing out volumes of white &s;moak, which do not ri&s;e in the air, but &s;eem to roll down the &s;ide of the mountain like a va&s;t torrent. The a&s;cent of Aetna on each &s;ide is computed at about 30 miles, and the circumference of its ba&s;e at 150: I think it does not appear to be &s;o much; but I &s;hall probably be enabled to give you a fuller account of it afterwards.</P>
<P>After admiring the great theatre of Taurominum, we went to examine the Naumachia, and the re&s;ervoirs for &s;upplying it with water. About 150 paces of one &s;ide of the wall of the Naumachia remains; but as this is not complete, there is no judging of its original dimen&s;ions. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a large &s;quare, inclo&s;ed with &s;trong walls, and capable of being filled with water on occa&s;ion; intended for the exhibi|tion of &s;ea-fights, and all naval exerci&s;es: There were four re&s;ervoirs for &s;upplying this with water. All are upon the &s;ame grand &s;cale. One of the&s;e is almo&s;t entire; it is &s;upported by a great number of &s;trong pillars, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of Titus' baths at Rome, and &s;everal others you may have &s;een in Italy. I would dwell longer on objects of this kind, but I am per&s;uaded de&s;criptions can give but a very imperfect idea of them; and to mark out the preci&s;e dimen&s;ions with a mathematical exactne&s;s, where there is nothing very remarkable, mu&s;t &s;urely be but a dry work, both to the writer and reader. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf (I hope it will content you too) with endeavour|ing to communicate, as entire as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion I my&s;elf &s;hall receive, without de&s;cending too much to particulars, or fatiguing my&s;elf or you

<P>I own I de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s: Few things I believe in writing being more difficult than thus <Q>s'emparer de l'imagination,</Q> to &s;eize&mdash;to make our&s;elves ma&s;ters of the reader's imagination, to carry it along with us through every &s;cene, and make it in a manner congenial with our own; every pro&s;pect opening upon him with the &s;ame light, and ari&s;ing in the &s;ame colours, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant too, as upon us: For where de&s;cription fail in this, the plea&s;ure of reading them mu&s;t be very trivial. Now, perhaps, this &s;ame journal &s;tyle is the mo&s;t favourable of any to produce the&s;e effects. It is at lea&s;t the mo&s;t agreeable to the writer; who never has his &s;ubject to &s;eek, but needs only recollect what has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he la&s;t laid down the pen, and travel the day over again; and if he travels it to good purpo&s;e, it ought to be equally agreeable to the reader too, who thereby becomes one of the party, and bears a &s;hare in all the plea&s;ures of the journey without &s;uffering from the fatigues of it.</P>
<P>One of my greate&s;t difficulties, I &s;ee, will be the finding proper places to write in, for the inns are alto|gether execrable, and there is no &s;uch thing as getting a room to one's &s;elf: I am ju&s;t now writing on the end of a barrel, which I cho&s;e rather than the table, as it is further removed from noi&s;e. I mu&s;t therefore intreat you, once for all, to excu&s;e incorrectne&s;s and want of method. How can one be methodical upon a barrel! It has ever been the mo&s;t declared enemy to method. You might as well expect a &s;ermon from Bacchus or a coherent &s;peech from our friend lord&mdash;after he has

fini&s;hed the third bottle. You will be plea&s;ed than ju&s;t to take things as they occur. Were I obliged to be &s;trictly methodical, I &s;hould have no plea&s;ure in writing you the&s;e letters; and then, if my po&s;ition is ju&s;t, you could have no plea&s;ure in reading them.</P>
<P>Our guards have procured us beds; though not in the town of Taurominum, but in Giardini, a village at the foot of the mountain on &s;tands. The people are extremely attentive, and have produced us an excellent &s;upper and good wine, which now waits&mdash;but &s;hall wait no longer. Adieu. To-morrow we intend to climb mount Aetna on this (its ea&s;t) &s;ide, if we find it practicable.</P>

<P>I AM already almo&s;t two days in arrears. Ye&s;terday we were &s;o much fatigued with the abominable roads of mount Aetna, that I was not able to wield a pen; and to-day, I a&s;&s;ure you, has by no means been a day of re&s;t; however, I mu&s;t not delay any longer, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall never be able to make up my lee-way. I am afraid you will &s;uffer more from the fatigues of the journey than I at fir&s;t apprehended.</P>
<P>We left Giardini at five o'clock. About half a mile farther the fir&s;t region of mount Aetna begins, and here they have &s;et up the &s;tatue of a &s;aint, for having prevented the lava from running up the moun|tain of Taurominum, and de&s;troying the adjacent coun|try;

which the people think it certainly mu&s;t have done, had it not been for this kind interpo&s;ition, but he very wi&s;ely, as well as humanely, conducted it down a low valley to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>We left the Catania road on the left, and began to a&s;cend the mountain, in order to vi&s;it the celebrated tree, known by the name of <HI>Il Ca&s;tagno de Cento Cavalli</HI> (The che&s;nut-tree of a hundred hor&s;e;) which for &s;ome centuries pa&s;t has been looked upon as one of the greate&s;t wonders of Aetna. We had likewi&s;e propo&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain the &s;ummit of the moun|tain by this &s;ide, and to de&s;cend by the &s;ide of Catania; but we were &s;oon convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of this, and obliged, with a good deal of reluctance, to relinqui&s;h that part of our &s;cheme.</P>
<P>As we advanced in the fir&s;t region of Aetna, we ob&s;erved that there had been eruptions of fire all over this country at a great di&s;tance from the &s;ummit, or principal crater of the mountain. On our road to the village of Piedmonte, I took notice of &s;everal very con&s;iderable craters; and &s;tones of a large &s;ize, &s;cattered all around, that had been di&s;charged from them. The&s;e &s;tones are preci&s;ely &s;uch as are thrown out of the crater of mount Ve&s;uvius; and indeed the lava too &s;eems to be of the &s;ame nature, though rather more porous.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Giardini to Piedmonte is only ten miles, but as the road is exceedingly rough and difficult, we took near four hours to travel it. The barometer, which at Giardini (on the &s;ea-&s;ide) &s;tood at 29 inches ten lines, had now fallen to 27: 3. Fahrenheit's thermometer made by Mr. Adams in London, 73 degrees. We found the people extremely
<PB N="58" REF="024150_0068_0FC3C369968935F8">
curious and inqui&s;itive to know our errand, which when we told, many of them offered to accompany us. Of the&s;e we cho&s;e two; and after drinking our tea, which was matter of great &s;peculation to the inhabitants, who had never before &s;een a breakfa&s;t of this kind, we began to climb the mountain.</P>
<P>We were directed for five or &s;ix miles of our road by an aqueduct, which the prince of Palagonia has made at a great expen&s;e, to &s;upply Piedmonte with water. After we left the aqueduct, the a&s;cent become a good deal more rapid, 'till we arrived at the begin|ning of the &s;econd region, called by the natives <HI>la Re|gione Sylvo&s;a,</HI> or the woody region; becau&s;e it is com|po&s;ed of one va&s;t fore&s;t, that extends all around the mountain. Part of this was de&s;troyed by a very &s;in|gular event, not later than the year 1755.&mdash;During an eruption of the volcano, an immen&s;e torrent of boiling water i&s;&s;ued, as is imagined, from the great crater of the mountain, and in an in&s;tant poured down to its ba&s;e: overwhelming and ruining every thing it met with in its cour&s;e. Our conductors &s;hewed us the traces of this torrent, which are &s;till very vi&s;ible; but are now beginning to recover verdure and vegeta|tion, which for &s;ome time appeared to have been lo&s;t. The track it has left, &s;eems to be about a mile and a half broad; and in &s;ome places &s;till more.</P>
<P>The common opinion, I find, is, that this water was rai&s;ed by the power of &s;uction, through &s;ome com|munication betwixt the volcano and the &s;ea; the ab|&s;urdity of which is too glaring to need a refutation. The power of &s;uction alone, even &s;uppo&s;ing a perfect vacuum, could never rai&s;e water to more than thirty-three or thirty-four feet, which is equal to the weight of a column of air the whole height of the atmo&s;phere.
<PB N="59" REF="024150_0069_0FC3C36B76CF3C18">
But this circum&s;tance, I &s;hould imagine, might be ea&s;ily enough accounted for; either by a &s;tream of lava falling &s;uddenly into one of the vallies of &s;now, that occupy the higher regions of the mountain, and melting it down: Or, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think is &s;till more probable, that the melted &s;now, finding va&s;t caverns and re&s;ervoirs in the mountain, where it is lodged for &s;ome time, 'till the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the lava below bur&s;ts the &s;ides of the&s;e caverns, produces this phaenomenon, which has been matter of great &s;peculation to the Sicilian philo&s;|ophers, and has employed the pens of &s;everal of them. The &s;ame thing happened in an eruption of Ve&s;uvius la&s;t century, and in an in&s;tant &s;wept away about 500 people, who were marching in proce&s;&s;ion at the foot of the mountain, to implore the meditation of St. Janu|arius.</P>
<P>Near to this place we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome beautiful woods of cork and ever-green oak, growing ab&s;olutely out of the lava, the &s;oil having as yet hardly filled the crevices of that porous &s;ub&s;tance; and not a great way farther, I ob&s;erved &s;everal little mountains that &s;eemed to have been formed by a late eruption. I di&s;mounted from my mule, and climbed to the top of them all. They are &s;even in number; every one of them with a regular cup or crater on the top, and in &s;ome the great gulph or (as they call it) <HI>Voragine,</HI> that had di&s;charged the burnt matter of which the&s;e little moun|tains are formed, is &s;till open. I tumbled &s;tones down into the&s;e gulphs, and heard the noi&s;e for a long time after. All the fields round to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, are covered with large burnt &s;tones di&s;charged from the&s;e little volcanos.</P>
<P>From this place, it is not le&s;s than five or &s;ix miles to the great che&s;nut-trees, through fore&s;ts growing out of
<PB N="60" REF="024150_0070_0FC3C36CD4DA4D78">
the lava, in &s;everal places almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. Of the&s;e there are many of an enormous &s;ize; but the Ca&s;tag|no de Cento Cavalli is by much the mo&s;t celebrated. I have even found it marked in an old map of Sicily, publi&s;hed near a hundred years ago; and in all the maps of Aetna, and its environs, it makes a very con&s;picuous figure. I own I was by no means &s;truck with its appearance, as it does not &s;eem to be one tree, but a bu&s;h of five large trees growing together. We complained to our guides of the impo&s;ition; when they unanimou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured us, that by the univer&s;al tradition and even te&s;timony of the country, all the&s;e were once united in one &s;tem; that their grandfathers remembered this, when it was looked upon as the glory of the fore&s;t, and vi&s;ited from all quarters; that for many years pa&s;t it had been reduced to the venerable ruin we beheld. We began to examine it with more attention, and found that there was indeed an appearance as if the&s;e five trees, had really been once united in one. The open|ing in the middle is at pre&s;ent prodigious; and it does indeed require faith to believe, that &s;o va&s;t a &s;pace was once occupied by &s;olid timber. But there is no appear|ance of bark on the in&s;ide of any of the &s;tumps, nor on the &s;ides that are oppo&s;ite to one another. Mr. Glover and I mea&s;ured it &s;eparately, and brought it exactly to the &s;ame &s;ize; viz. 204 feet round. If this was once united in one &s;olid &s;tem, it mu&s;t with ju&s;tice indeed have been looked upon as a very wonderful phaenom|enon in the vegetable world, and was de&s;ervedly &s;tiled the glory of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince been told by the Canonico Recupero, an ingenious eccle&s;ia&s;tic of this place, that he was at the expen&s;e of carrying up pea&s;ants with tools to dig round the Ca&s;tagno de Cento Cavalli, and he a&s;&s;ures me, upon his honour, that he found all the&s;e &s;tems united

below ground in one root. I alledged that &s;o extraor|dinary an object mu&s;t have been mentioned by many of their writers. He told me that it had, and produced &s;everal examples; Philateo, Carrera, and &s;ome others. Carrera begs to be excu&s;ed from telling its dimen&s;ions, but &s;ays, he is &s;ure there was wood enough in that one tree to build a large palace. Their poet Bagolini too has celebrated a tree of the &s;ame kind, perhaps the &s;ame tree;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Supremos inter montes mon&s;tro&s;ior omni</L>

I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay, that this is the &s;ame tree he means; or whether it was ever one tree or not. There are many others that are well de&s;erving the curio&s;ity of travelers. One of the&s;e about a mile and a half higher on the mountain, is called <HI>Il Ca&s;tagno del Galea;</HI> it ri&s;es from one &s;olid &s;tem to a con&s;iderable height, after which it branches out, and is a much finer object than the other. I mea&s;ured it about two feet from the ground and found it 76 feet round. There is a third called <HI>Il C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agno del Nave,</HI> that is pretty nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize. All the&s;e grow on a thick rich &s;oil, formed originally, I believe, of a&s;hes thrown out by the mountain.</P>
<P>The climate here is much more temperate than in the fir&s;t region of Aetna, where the exce&s;&s;ive heats mu&s;t ever prevent a very luxuriant vegetation. I
<PB N="62" REF="024150_0072_0FC3C36FC88ACC50">
found the barometer had now fallen to 26: 5&frac12;; which announces an elevation of very near four thou&s;and feet: equivalent in the opinion of &s;ome of the French academicians, to 18 or 20 degrees of latitude in the formation of a climate.</P>
<P>The va&s;t quantity of nitre contained in the a&s;hes of Aetna, probably contributes greatly to increa&s;e the luxuriance of this vegetation; and the air too, &s;trongly impregnated with it from the &s;moke of the volcano, mu&s;t create a con&s;tant &s;upply of this &s;alt, termed by &s;ome, not without rea&s;on, the food of vegetables.</P>
<P>There is the ruins of a hou&s;e in the in&s;ide of the great che&s;nut-tree which had been built for holding the fruit it bears, which is &s;till con&s;iderable: here we dined with excellent appetite, and being convinced, that it was in vain to attempt getting to the top of the mountain on that &s;ide, we began to de&s;cend; and after a very fatiguing journey over old lavas, now become fertile fields and rich vineyards, we arrived about &s;un|&s;et at <HI>Jaci Reale,</HI> where, with no &s;mall difficulty, we at la&s;t got lodging in a convent of Dominicans.</P>
<P>The la&s;t lava we cro&s;&s;ed before our arrival there, is of a va&s;t extent, I thought we never &s;hould have had done with it; it certainly is not le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even miles broad, and appears in many places to be of an enormous depth.</P>
<P>When we came near the &s;ea, I was de&s;irous to &s;ee what form it had a&s;&s;umed in meeting with the water. I went to examine it and found it had driven back the waves for upwards of a mile, and had formed a large black high promontory, where before it was deep water. This lava, I imagined, from its barrenne&s;s, for it is as yet covered with a very &s;canty &s;oil, had run from
<PB N="63" REF="024150_0073_0FC3C37133D29A00">
the mountain only a few ages ago; but was &s;urpri&s;ed to be informed by Signor Recupero, the hi&s;toriogra|pher of Aetna, that this very lava is mentioned by Dio|dorus Siculus to have bur&s;t from Aetna in the time of the &s;econd Punic war, when Syracu&s;e was be&s;ieged by the Romans. A detachment was &s;ent from Taurom|inum to the relief of the be&s;ieged. They were &s;topp|ed on their march by this &s;tream of lava, which having reached the &s;ea before their arrival at the foot of the mountain, had cut off their pa&s;&s;age; and obliged them to return by the back of Aetna, upwards of 100 miles about. His authority for this, he tells me was taken from in&s;criptions on Roman monuments found on this lava, and that it was likewi&s;e well a&s;certained by many of the old Sicilian authors. Now as this is about 2000 years ago, one would have imagined, if lavas have a regular progre&s;s in becoming fertile fields, that this mu&s;t long ago have become at lea&s;t arable; this how|ever is not the ca&s;e, and it is as yet only covered with a very &s;canty vegetation, and incapable of producing either corn or vines. There are indeed pretty large trees growing in the crevices, which are full of a rich earth; but in all probability it will be &s;ome hundred years yet, before there is enough of it to render this land of any u&s;e to the proprietors.</P>
<P>It is curious to con&s;ider, that the &s;urface of this black and barren matter, in proce&s;s of time, becomes one of the mo&s;t fertile &s;oils upon earth: But what mu&s;t be the time to bring it to its utmo&s;t perfection, when after 2000 years it is &s;till in mo&s;t places but a barren rock?&mdash;Its progre&s;s is po&s;&s;ibly as follows. The lava being a very porous &s;ub&s;tance, ea&s;ily catches the du&s;t that is car|ried about by the wind; which at fir&s;t, I ob&s;erve only yields a kind of mo&s;s; this rotting, and by degrees increa&s;ing the &s;oil, &s;ome &s;mall meagre vegetables are next produ|ced;
<PB N="64" REF="024150_0074_0FC3C372B62AB300">
which rotting in their turn, are likewi&s;e converted into &s;oil. But this progre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, is often greatly accelerated by &s;howers of a&s;hes from the mountain, as I have ob&s;erved in &s;ome places the riche&s;t &s;oil, to the depth of 5 or 6 feet and upwards; and &s;till below that nothing but rocks of lava. It is in the&s;e &s;pots that the trees arrive at &s;uch an immen&s;e &s;ize. Their roots &s;hoot into the crevices of the lava, and lay &s;uch hold of it, that there is no in&s;tance of the winds tearing them up; though there are many, of its breaking off their large&s;t branches. A branch of one of the great che&s;nut-trees, where we pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday, has fallen acro&s;s a deep gully, and formed a very commodious bridge over the rivulet below. The people &s;ay it was done by St. Agatha, the guardian &s;aint of the mountain, who has the &s;uperintendence of all its operations.</P>
<P>In the lowe&s;t part of the fir&s;t region of Aetna, the harve&s;t is almo&s;t over; but in the upper parts of the &s;ame region, near the confines of the Regione Sylvo&s;a, it will not begin for &s;everal weeks.</P>
<P>The reapers, as we went along, abu&s;ed us from all quarters, and more excellent blackguards I have never met with; but indeed, our guides were a full match for them. They began as &s;oon as we were within hearing, and did not fini&s;h till we were got quite with|out reach of their voices; which they extended as much as they could. As it was all in Sicilian, we could make very little of it, but by the interpretation of our guides; however we could not help admiring the volubility and natural elocution with which they &s;poke. This cu&s;tom is as old as the time of the Romans, and probably much older, as it is mentioned by Horace, and others, of their authors. It is &s;till in vogue here as much as ever; the ma&s;ters encourage

it; they think it gives them &s;pirits, and makes the work go on more cheerfully; and I believe they are right, for it is amazing what plea&s;ure they &s;eemed to take in it, and what laughing and merriment it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ource of the famous cold river <HI>(il fium<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Freddo.)</HI> This is the river &s;o celebrated by the poets in the fable of Acis and Galatea. It was here that Acis was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been killed by Poliphemus, and the gods out of com|pa&s;&s;ion converted him into this river; which, as &s;till retaining the terror in&s;pired by the dreadful voice of the Cyclops, runs with great rapidity, and about a mile from its &s;ource throws it&s;elf into the &s;ea. It ri&s;es at once out of the earth a large &s;tream. Its water is remarkably pure, and &s;o extremely cold, that it is rec|koned dangerous to drink it; but I am told it has likewi&s;e a poi&s;onous quality, which proceeds from its being impregnated with vitriol; to &s;uch a degree, that cattle have often been killed by it. It never freezes; but, what is remarkable, it is &s;aid often to contract a degree of cold greater than that of ice.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars I was informed of by the prie&s;ts at Aci; which place, anciently called Aci Aquileia, and &s;everal others near it, Aci Ca&s;tello, Aci Terra, &amp;c. take their names from the unfortunate &s;hepherd Acis.</P>
<P>A little to the ea&s;t of the river Acis, is the mouth of the river Alcantara, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the i&s;land. It takes its ri&s;e on the north &s;ide of mount Aetna, and marks out the boundary of the mountain for about 60 miles. Its cour&s;e has been &s;topped in many places, by the eruptions of the volcano; &s;o that &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, the &s;kirts of Aetna extend much beyond it; though it has generally been con&s;idered as the boundary.
<PB N="66" REF="024150_0076_0FC3C375A7A7C778">
We pa&s;&s;ed it on our way to Piedmonte, over a large bridge built entirely of lava; and near to this the bed of the river is continued for a great way, through one of the mo&s;t remarkable, and probably one of the mo&s;t ancient lavas that ever run from Aetna. In many places the current of the river, which is extremely rapid, has worn down the &s;olid lava to the depth of 50 or 60 feet. Recupero, the gentleman I have men|tioned, who is engaged in writing the natural hi&s;tory of Aetna, tells me, he had examined this lava with great attention, and he thinks that its cour&s;e, including all its windings, is not le&s;s than 40 miles. It i&s;&s;ued from a mountain in the north &s;ide of Aetna, and finding &s;ome vallies that lay to the ea&s;t, it took its cour&s;e that way; interrupting the Alcantara in many places, and at la&s;t arrived at the &s;ea not far from the mouth of that river.</P>
<P>The city of Jaci or Aci, and indeed all the towns on this coa&s;t, are founded on immen&s;e rocks of lava, heaped one above another, in &s;ome places to an ama|zing height; for it appears that the&s;e flaming torrents, as &s;oon they arrived at the &s;ea, were hardened into rock, which not yielding any longer to the pre&s;&s;ure of the liquid fire behind, the melted matter continuing to accumulate, formed a dam of fire, which, in a &s;hort time, run over the &s;olid front, pouring a &s;econd torrent into the ocean: this was immediately con&s;olidated, and &s;ucceeded by a third, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>Many of the places on this coa&s;t &s;till retain their ancient names; but the properties a&s;cribed to them by the ancients are now no more. The river Acis, which is now &s;o poi&s;onous, was of old celebrated for the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;alubrity of its waters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Quique per Aetnaeos Acis petit aequora fines,</L>

<P>We were &s;urpri&s;ed to find that &s;o many places re|tained the name of this &s;wain, who I imagined had never exi&s;ted, but in the imagination of the poets: But the Sicilian author &s;ay, that Acis was the name of a king who reigned in this part of the i&s;land, in the time of the mo&s;t remote antiquity; in confirmation of which, Ma&s;&s;a gives the tran&s;lation of an in&s;cription found near Aci Ca&s;tello. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DIAE OGNIAE, SATURNIAE, AETNAEAE DEORUM, MARTI, FILIAE, UXORI, IN PORTU SEPULCHRUM, TEMPLUM, ET ARCEM ACIS, FAUNI FILIUS, PICI NEPOS, SATURNI PRONEPOS, LATINI FRATER.</NOTE> He is &s;aid to have been &s;lain in a fit of jealou&s;y by Poliphemus, one of the giants of Aetna; which gave ri&s;e to the fable. Anguillara, a Sicilian poet, in relating this &s;tory gives a tremendous idea of the voice of Poliphemus; the pa&s;&s;age has been greatly admired.

<P>THE road from Jaci to this city is entirely over lava, and con&s;equently very fatiguing and trouble&s;ome. Within a few miles of that place, we counted eight mountains formed by eruption, with every one its
<PB N="69" REF="024150_0079_0FC3C37A15F96D60">
crater, from whence the burnt matter was di&s;charged. Some of the&s;e are very high, and of a great compa&s;s. It appears evidently, that the eruptions of mount Aetna have formed the whole of this coa&s;t, and in many places have driven back the &s;ea for &s;everal miles from its ancient boundary. The account the Sicilian authors give betwixt the&s;e two aver&s;e elements is truly tremendous; and in relating it, they &s;eem to have been &s;haken with horror. Conceive the front of a torrent of fire, ten miles in breadth, and heaped up to an enormous height, rolling down the mountain; and pouring its flames into the ocean! The noi&s;e, they a&s;&s;ure us, is infinitely more dreadful than the loude&s;t thunder; and is heard through the whole country to an immen&s;e di&s;tance. The water &s;eemed to retire and dimini&s;h before the fire, and to confe&s;s its &s;uperiority; yielding up its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and contracting its banks, to make room for its imperious ma&s;ter, who commands it: "Thus far &s;halt thou come, and no farther."&mdash;The clouds of &s;alt vapour darken the face of the &s;un, covering up this &s;cene, under a veil of horror and of night; and laying wa&s;te every field and vineyard in tho&s;e regions of the i&s;land. The whole fi&s;h on the coa&s;t are de&s;troyed, the colour of the &s;ea it&s;elf is chang|ed, and the tran&s;parency of its waters lo&s;t for many months.</P>
<P>There are three rocks of lava at &s;ome little di&s;tance from &s;hore, which Pliny takes frequent notice of, and calls them the Three Cyclops. It is pretty &s;ingular, that they are &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>The fate of Catania has been very remarkable, and will ever appear fabulous. It is &s;ituated immediately at the foot of this great volcano, and has been &s;everal times de&s;troyed by it: That indeed is not extraordina|ry;
<PB N="70" REF="024150_0080_0FC3C37DE7103A98">
it would have been much more &s;o had it e&s;caped: But what I am going to relate, is a &s;ingularity that probably never happened to any city but it&s;elf. It was always in great want of a port, 'till by an eruption in the 16th century; and no doubt, by the interpo&s;ition of St. Agatha, what was denied them by nature, they received from the genero&s;ity of the mountain. A &s;tream of lava, running into the &s;ea, formed a mole which no expen&s;e could have furni&s;hed them. This la&s;ted for &s;ome time a &s;afe and commodious harbour, 'till at la&s;t, by &s;ub&s;equent eruption, it was entirely filled up and demoli&s;hed; &s;o that probably the poor &s;aint had &s;unk much in her credit. For at this unfor|tunate period, her miraculous veil, looked upon as the greate&s;t trea&s;ure of Catania, and e&s;teemed an infallible remedy again&s;t earthquakes and volcanos, &s;eems to have lo&s;t its virtue. The torrent bur&s;t over the walls, &s;weeping away the images of every &s;aint that were placed there to oppo&s;e it; and laying wa&s;te great part of this beautiful city, poured into the &s;ea. However, the people &s;ay, that at that time they had given their &s;aint very ju&s;t provocation, but that &s;he has long ago been reconciled to them; and has promi&s;ed never to &s;uffer the mountain to get the better of them for the future. Many of them are &s;o thoroughly convinced of this (for they are extremely &s;uper&s;titious) that I really believe if the lava were at their walls, they would not be at the pains to remove their effects. Neither is it the veil of St. Agatha alone, that they think po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of this wonderful dominion over he mountain; but every thing has touched that piece of &s;acred attire, they &s;uppo&s;e is impregnated in a le&s;&s;er degree with the &s;ame miraculous properties. Thus there are a number of little bits of cotton and linen fixed to the veil; which, after being ble&s;&s;ed by the bi&s;hop, are &s;uppo&s;ed to acquire power enough to &s;ave any per&s;on's
<PB N="71" REF="024150_0081_0FC3C3879EEAB7F8">
hou&s;e or garden; and wherever this expedient has failed, it is always a&s;cribed to the want of faith of the per&s;on, not any want of efficacy in the veil. How|ever, they tell you many &s;tories of the&s;e bits of cotton being fixed to the walls of hou&s;es and vineyards, and pre&s;erving them entirely from the conflagration.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Catania, we were amazed to find, that in &s;o noble and beautiful a city, there was no &s;uch thing as an inn. Our guides, indeed, conducted us to a hou&s;e they called &s;uch; but it was &s;o wretchedly mean and dirty, that we were obliged to look out for other lodgings; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Canonico Recu|pero, for whom we had letters, we &s;oon found our&s;elves comfortably lodged in a convent. The prince of Bi&s;caris (the governour of the place) a per&s;on of very great merit and di&s;tinction, returned our vi&s;it this fore|noon, and made us the mo&s;t obliging offers.</P>
<P>Signor Recupero, who obligingly engages to be our Cicerone, has &s;hewn us &s;ome curious remains of antiquity; but they have been all &s;o &s;haken and &s;hatter|ed by the mountain, that hardly any thing is to be found entire.</P>
<P>Near to a vault, which is now thirty feet below ground, and has probably been a burial place, there is a draw-well, where there are &s;everal &s;trata of lavas, with earth to a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s over the &s;urface of each &s;tratum Recupero has made u&s;e of this as an argu|ment to prove the great antiquity of the eruptions of his mountain. For if it requires two thou&s;and years or upwards, to from but a &s;canty &s;oil on the &s;urface of a lava, there mu&s;t have been more than that &s;pace of time betwixt each of the eruptions which have formed the&s;e &s;trata. But what &s;hall we &s;ay of a pit they &s;unk
<PB N="72" REF="024150_0082_0FC3C3894B42DFA0">
near to Jaci of a great depth. They pierced through &s;even di&s;tinct lavas one under the other, the &s;urfaces of which were parrellel, and mo&s;t of them covered with a thick bed of rich earth. Now, &s;ays he, the eruption which formed the lowe&s;t of the&s;e lavas, if we may be allowed to rea&s;on from analogy, mu&s;t have flowed from the mountain at lea&s;t 14000 years ago.</P>
<P>Recupero tells me he is exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed, by the&s;e di&s;coveries, in writing the hi&s;tory of the moun|tain. That Mo&s;es hangs like a dead weight upon him, and blunts all his zeal for inquiry; for that really he has not the con&s;cience to make his mountain &s;o young, as that prophet makes the world.&mdash;What do you think of the&s;e &s;entiments from a Roman Catholic divine?&mdash;The bi&s;hop, who is &s;trenuou&s;ly orthodox, for it is an excellent &s;ee, has already warned him to be upon his guard: and not to pretend to be a better nat|ural hi&s;torian than Mo&s;es: nor to pre&s;ume to urge any thing that may in the &s;malle&s;t degree be deemed contradictory to his &s;acred authority.

<P>THIS morning we went to &s;ee the hou&s;e and mu&s;eum of the prince of Bi&s;caris; which, in antiques, is inferior to none I have ever &s;een, except that of the king of Naples at Portici. What adds greatly to the value of the&s;e is, that the prince him&s;elf has had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing mo&s;t of them brought to light. He has dug them out of the ruins of the ancient thea|tre of Catania, at an incredible expence; but happily
<PB N="73" REF="024150_0083_0FC3C38AC2D3B588">
his pains have been amply repaid, by the number and variety of curious objects he has di&s;covered. It would be endle&s;s to enter into an enumeration of them; even during our &s;hort &s;tay. We had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing part of a rich Corinthian cornice and &s;everal pieces of &s;tatues, produced again to the light, after lying for &s;o many ages in darkne&s;s and oblivion. His collection of medals, cameos, and intaglios is likewi&s;e very princely, and &s;o are the articles in natural hi&s;tory: But the polite and amiable behaviour of the owner, gives more plea&s;ure than all his curio&s;ities. He did not, o&s;tentatiou&s;ly, like the prince of Villa Franca, tell us, that his hou&s;e and carriages were at our command; but without any hint being given of it, we found his coach waiting at our door; and we &s;hall probably be obliged to make u&s;e of it during our &s;tay. His family con&s;i&s;ts of the prince&s;s his wife, a &s;on, and a daughter, who &s;eem to emulate each other in benignity. They put me in mind of &s;ome happy families I have &s;een in our own country, but re&s;emble nothing we have yet met with on the continent. He is ju&s;t now building a curious villa on a promontory formed by the lava of 1669. The &s;pot where the hou&s;e &s;tands was formerly at lea&s;t 50 feet deep of water; and the height of the lava above the pre&s;ent level of the &s;ea, is not le&s;s than 50 more.</P>
<P>This afternoon I walked out alone to examine the capricious forms and &s;ingular appearances that this de&s;tructive branch has a&s;&s;umed in laying wa&s;te the coun|try. I had not gone far when I &s;pied a magnificent building at &s;ome di&s;tance, which &s;eemed to &s;tand on the highe&s;t part of it. My curio&s;ity led me on, as I had heard no mention of any palace on this &s;ide of the city. On entering the great gate, my &s;urpri&s;e was a good deal increa&s;ed on ob&s;erving a fa&ccedil;ade almo&s;t equal to that of Ver&s;ailles; a noble &s;tairca&s;e of white
<PB N="74" REF="024150_0084_0FC3C38C3810F378">
marble, and every thing that announced a royal magnificence. I had never heard that the kings of Sicily had a palace at Catania, and yet I could not ac|count for what I &s;aw in any other way. I thought the va&s;t front before me had been the whole of the pal|ace; but conceive my amazement, which on turning the corner, I found another front of equal greatne&s;s; and di&s;covered that what I had &s;een was only one &s;ide of a &s;quare.</P>
<P>I was no longer in doubt, well knowing that the church alone could be mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch magnificence. I ha&s;tened home to communicate this di&s;covery to my friends; when I found the Canonico Recupero already with them. He abu&s;ed me exceedingly for pre&s;uming to go out without our Cicerone, and declared he had never been &s;o much di&s;appointed in his life; as he had come on purpo&s;e to carry us there, and to enjoy our &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment. He then told us, that it was no other than a convent of fat Benedictine monks; who were determined to make &s;ure of a paradi&s;e, at lea&s;t in this world, if not in the other. He added, that they were worth about 15,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year; an im|men&s;e &s;um indeed for this country.</P>
<P>We went with Recupero to pay our re&s;pects to the&s;e &s;ons of humility, temperance, and mortification; and we mu&s;t own, they received and entertained us with great civility and politene&s;s, and even without o&s;tenta|tion. Their mu&s;eum is little inferior to that of the prince of Bi&s;caris, and the apartments that contain it are much more magnificent. But their garden is the greate&s;t curio&s;ity: Although it be formed on the rugged and barren &s;urface of the lava, it has a variety and a neatne&s;s &s;eldom to be met with. The walks are broad, and paved with flints; and the trees and hedges
<PB N="75" REF="024150_0085_0FC3C392AA9853D0">
(which by the bye are in a bad ta&s;te, and cut into a number of ridiculous &s;hapes) thrive exceedingly. The whole &s;oil mu&s;t have been brought from a great di&s;tance, as the &s;urface of this lava (only 150 years old) is as hard and bare as a piece of iron. The church belonging to this convent, if fini&s;hed, would be one of the fine&s;t in Europe; but as it is founded on the &s;ur|face of the porous and brittle lava, part of the foundation has given way to the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o huge a fabric; and &s;everal of the large arches that were intended to form the different chapels, have already fallen down. Only the we&s;t limb of the cro&s;s (not a fifth of the whole) is fini&s;hed; and even this alone makes a very fine church. Here they have the fine&s;t organ I ever heard, even &s;uperior, I think, to that at Harlem.</P>
<P>We went next to examine where the lava had &s;caled the Walls of Catania. It mu&s;t have been a noble fight. The walls are 64 palms high, (near 60 feet) and of a great &s;trength; otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have been borne down by the force of the flaming matter which ro&s;e over this height, and &s;eems to have mounted con&s;iderably above the top of the wall before it made its entry; at la&s;t it came down, were &s;weeping before it every &s;aint in the calendar, who were drawn up in order of battle on purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e its pa&s;&s;age and marching on in triumph, annihilated, in a manner, every object that dared to oppo&s;e it. Among other things, it covered up &s;ome fine fountains; one of which was &s;o much e&s;teemed, that they have at a great expence pierced through the lava, and have now recovered their favourite &s;pring. This excavation is a very curious work, and worthy of the attention of travellers.</P>
<P>Catania is looked upon as one of the mo&s;t ancient cities in the i&s;land, or indeed in the world. Their
<PB N="76" REF="024150_0086_0FC3C39395E963E8">
legends bear, that it was founded by the Cyclops, or giants of Aetna, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the fir&s;t inhabi|tants of Sicily after the deluge; and &s;ome of the Sicilian writers pretend that it was built by Deucalion and Pyrrha, as &s;oon as the waters &s;ub&s;ided, and they had got down again to the foot of the mountain. Its antient name was Catetna, or the city of Aetna.</P>
<P>It is now reckoned the third city in the kingdom; though &s;ince Me&s;&s;ina was de&s;troyed by the plague, it may well be con&s;idered as the &s;econd. It contains upwards of 30,000 inhabitants; has a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Univer&s;ity, the only one in the i&s;land; and a bi&s;hopric. The bi&s;hop's revenues are con&s;iderable, and ari&s;e principally from the &s;ale of the &s;now on mount Aetna. One &s;mall portion of which, lying on the north of the mountain, is &s;aid to bring him in upwards of 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year; for Aetna furni&s;hes &s;now and ice, not only to the whole i&s;land of Sicily, but likewi&s;e to Malta and a great part of Italy, and makes a very con&s;iderable branch of com|merce; for even the pea&s;ants in the&s;e hot countries, regale them&s;elves with ices during the &s;ummer heats; and there is no entertainment given by the nobility, of which the&s;e do not always make a principal part: a famine of &s;now they them&s;elves &s;ay, would be more grievous, than a famine of either corn or wine. It is a common ob&s;ervation among&s;t them, that without the &s;nows of mount Aetna, their i&s;land could not be inhab|ited; &s;o e&s;&s;ential has this article of luxury become to them. But Aetna not only keeps them cool in &s;ummer, but likewi&s;e keeps them warm in winter; the fuel for the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land being carried from the immen&s;e and inexhau&s;tible fore&s;ts of this volcano, and con&s;titutes too, a very large branch of commerce. But this amazing mountain perpetually carries me away from my &s;ubject: I was &s;peaking of this city.
<PB N="77" REF="024150_0087_0FC3C395527F0FC8">
What of it was &s;pared by the eruption 1669, was totally ruined by the fatal earthquake 1693; when the greate&s;t part of its inhabitants were buried under the walls of their hou&s;es and churches. Yet, after &s;uch repeated, and &s;uch di&s;mal di&s;a&s;ters, &s;o &s;trange is their infatuation, that they never could be prevailed upon to change their &s;ituation. The whole city was &s;oon rebuilt, after a new and an elegant plan, and is now much hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">omer than ever. There is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any doubt, that in &s;ome future commotion of the mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it will be again laid in a&s;hes. But at pre&s;ent they are in perfect &s;ecurity: The Virgin and St. Agatha have both engaged to protect them; and under their banner they hold Aetna with all the devil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it contains, at defiance.</P>
<P>There are many remains of antiquity in this city, but indeed mo&s;t of them are in a very ruinous &s;tate. One of the mo&s;t remarkable is an elephant of lava, with an obeli&s;k of Egyptian granite on his back. There are likewi&s;e con&s;iderable remains of a great theatre, be&s;ides the one belonging to the prince of Bi&s;caris; a large bath almo&s;t entire; the ruins of the great aqueduct, 18 miles long; the ruins of &s;everal temples, one of Ceres, another of Vulcan: The church called <HI>Bocca <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> was likewi&s;e a temple. But the mo&s;t entire of all, is a &s;mall rotundo, which, as well as the pantheon at Rome, and &s;ome others to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with in Italy, in my opinion; demon&s;trates that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be the mo&s;t durable of any.</P>
<P>It has now been purged and purified from all the infection contracted from the heathen rites, and is become a chri&s;tian church, dedicated to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; who has long been con&s;tituted univer&s;al legatee, and executrix to all the antient godde&s;&s;es, cele&s;tial,
<PB N="78" REF="024150_0088_0FC3C396C171EB38">
terre&s;trial, and infernal: and indeed, little more than the names are changed, the things continuing pretty much the &s;ame as ever.&mdash;The Catholics them&s;elves do not attend to it: but it is not a little curious to con&s;id|er how &s;mall is the deviation in almo&s;t every article of their pre&s;ent rites from tho&s;e of the ancients. I have &s;omewhere &s;een an ob&s;ervation, which &s;eems to be a ju&s;t one: That during the long reign of heatheni&s;m, super&s;tition had altogether exhau&s;ted her talent for invention; &s;o that when a &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit &s;eized chri&s;tians, they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing from their predece&s;&s;ors, and imitating &s;ome part of their idolatry. This appears to be &s;trictly the ca&s;e. I took notice of it to Signor R&mdash;, who is not the mo&s;t zealous &s;ectary in the world, and who frankly owned the truth of the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places the very &s;ame images &s;till remain: They have only chri&s;tened them; and what was Venus or Pro&s;erpine, is now Mary Magdalene, or the Virgin. The &s;ame ceremonies are daily performed before the&s;e images; in the &s;ame language, and nearly in the &s;ame manner. The &s;aints are perpetually com|ing down in per&s;on, and working miracles, as the heathen gods did of old. The walls of the temples are covered with the vows of pilgrims, as they were formerly. The holy water, which was held in &s;uch dete&s;tation by the fir&s;t chri&s;tians, is again revered, and &s;prinkled about with the &s;ame devotion as in the time of pagani&s;m. The &s;ame incen&s;e is burnt, by prie&s;ts arrayed in the &s;ame manner, with the &s;ame grimaces and genuflec|tions, before the &s;ame images, and in the &s;ame temples too. In &s;hort, &s;o nearly do the rites coincide, that were the pagan high-prie&s;t to come back, and re-a&s;&s;ume his functions, he would only have to learn a few new names; to get the Ma&s;s, the Paters, and the Aves by

heart; which would be much ea&s;ier to him, as they are in a language he under&s;tands, but which his modern &s;ucce&s;&s;ors are often ignorant of. Some things, to be &s;ure, would puzzle him; and he would &s;wear that all the my&s;teries of Eleu&s;is were nothing to the amazing my&s;tery of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; the only one that ever attempted to &s;et both our under&s;tanding and our &s;en&s;es at defiance, and baffles equally all the faculties both of the &s;oul and body. He would, likewi&s;e, be a good deal at a lo&s;s to account for the &s;trange metamorpho&s;is of &s;ome of his old friends. That (he would &s;ay) I can well remember, was the &s;tatue of Venus Meretrix, and was only wor&s;hipped by the loo&s;e and voluptuous. She &s;eems to be wonderfully improved &s;ince you made her a chri&s;tian; for I find &s;he is now become the great protectre&s;s of cha&s;tity and of virtue.&mdash;Juno too, who was &s;o implacable and &s;o revengeful, you have &s;oftened down into a very moderate &s;ort of deity; for I ob&s;erve you addre&s;s her with as little fear or ceremony as any of the re&s;t of them; I wi&s;h you would make the Furies chri&s;tians too, for &s;urely they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much the bet|ter for it. But ob&s;erving the figure of St. Anthony, he would exclaim with a&s;toni&s;hment. But what do I behold! Jupiter, the &s;overeign of gods and men, with a ragged cloak over his &s;houlders! What a humilia|ting &s;pectacle! Well do I remember, with what awe we bent before that once re&s;pectable image. But what is become of the thunderbolt, which he held in his hand to cha&s;ti&s;e the world; and what is that he has got in its place? His conductor would tell him, that it was only a piece of rope, with knots upon it to cha&s;ti&s;e him&s;elf; adding, that he was now doing penance for his long u&s;urpation; and that the thunder had long ago been put into better hands. However, he would &s;oon find, that even the&s;e &s;aints &s;ometimes change their names, according to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic caprice of the

One day, as he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatue of Jupiter in the capitol, he pulled off his hat, and made him a bow.&mdash;A jacobite gentleman, who ob&s;erved it, a&s;ked him why he paid &s;o much re&s;pect to that old gentleman.&mdash;For the &s;ame rea&s;on, replied Huet, that you pay &s;o much to the Pretender. Be&s;ides, added he, I think there is rather a greater probability that his turn will come round again, than that of your hero; I &s;hall therefore endeavour to keep well with him, and hope he will never forget that I took notice of him in the time of his adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Indeed, within the cour&s;e of my own ob&s;ervation, I can recollect &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital &s;aints in the cal|endar, who have been di&s;graced by the people, and new names given to their &s;tatues. When we were in Portugal la&s;t war, the people of Ca&s;tel Branc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were &s;o enraged at St. Antonio, for following the Spaniards to plunder the town, contrary, as they affirmed, to his ex|pre&s;s agreement with them, that they broke many of his &s;tatues to pieces; and one that had been more rev|ered than the re&s;t, they took the head off, and clapped on one of St. Francis in its place; who&s;e name the &s;tatue ever after retained. Even the great St. Janua|rius him&s;elf, I am told, was in imminent danger during the la&s;t famine at Naples. A Swi&s;s gentleman a&s;&s;ured me, that he had heard them load him with abu&s;e and invective; and declared point-blank, that if he did not procure them corn by &s;uch a time, he &s;hould no longer be their &s;aint. However, &s;uch in&s;tances are but rare; and in general the poor catholics are fully indemnified

for the&s;e &s;udden fits of pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment, from the full per&s;ua&s;ion of the immediate pre&s;ence and pro|tection of their beloved patrons.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, with plea&s;ure, that glow of gratitude and affection that has animated their countenances; and am per&s;uaded that the warmth of enthu&s;ia&s;tic devo|tion they often feel before their favourite &s;aints, particularly their female ones, mu&s;t have &s;omething extremely delightful in it; re&s;embling; perhaps, the pure and delicate &s;en&s;ations of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful love. I own I have &s;ometimes envied them their feelings; and in my heart cur&s;ed the pride of rea&s;on and philo&s;o|phy, with all its cool and ta&s;tele&s;s triumphs, that lulls into a kind of &s;toical apathy the&s;e mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ations of the &s;oul. Who would not chu&s;e to be deceived, when the deception rai&s;es in him the&s;e delicious pa&s;&s;ions, that are &s;o worthy of the human heart; and for which, of all others, it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t fitted? But if once you have &s;teeled it over with the hard and impenetrable temper of philo&s;ophy; the&s;e fine-&s;pun threads of weakne&s;s and affection, that were &s;o pliable, and &s;o ea&s;ily tied, become hard and inflexible; and for ever lo&s;e that delicate tone of &s;en&s;ibility that put them into a kind of uni&s;on and vibration with every object around us: For it is certainly true, what has been &s;aid of one part of our &s;pecies, and may almo&s;t with equal ju&s;tice be applied to the whole,
<Q>"That to their weakne&s;s half their charms we owe."</Q></P>
<P>I remember Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot told me, he had a patient that actually died of love for Chri&s;t and when in the la&s;t extremity, &s;eemed &s;till to enjoy the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s; calling upon him with all the fondne&s;s of the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion. And from what I have

<P>Now, pray don't you think too, that this per&s;onal kind of wor&s;hip is much better adapted to the capaci|ties of the vulgar, than the more pure and &s;ublime modes of it; which would only di&s;tract and confound their &s;imple under&s;tandings, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;pecu|lation; and that certainly require &s;omething gro&s;s and material, &s;ome object of &s;en&s;e to fix their attention? This even &s;eems to have been the opinion of &s;ome of the &s;acred writers, who often repre&s;ent God under &s;ome material form.</P>
<P>Were you to attempt to give a country fellow an idea of the Deity; were you to tell him of a being that is immaterial, and yet who&s;e e&s;&s;ence penetrates all mat|ter; who has exi&s;ted from all eternity, and who&s;e exten&s;ion is equally boundle&s;s with his duration; who fills and pervades millions of worlds, and animates every object they contain; and who, in the &s;ublime language of our poet,
<Q><L>"Tho' chang'd thro' all, is yet in all the &s;ame,</L>
<L>"Great in the earth, as in th' aetherial frame:</L>

Now, what do you imagine he would think of &s;uch a being? I am afraid his under&s;tanding would be &s;o be|wildered, that he could not think at all. But, &s;et up

<P>Adieu. We are going to be very bu&s;y; and are preparing every thing for one of the greate&s;t objects of our expedition: the examination of mount Aetna. Indeed, we have received but bad encouragement; and are beginning to doubt of the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s. Recupero tells us, that the &s;ea&s;on is not far enough advanced yet, by &s;ome months; and that he does not think it will be po&s;&s;ible to get near the &s;ummit of the mountain. The la&s;t winter, he &s;ays, was &s;o uncom|monly &s;evere, that the circle of &s;now extended much nearer the foot of the mountain than u&s;ual; that although this circle is now greatly contracted, it &s;till extends nine or ten miles below the crater. He advi&s;es us to return this way in the month of Augu&s;t; and, if po&s;&s;ible, make Aetna the la&s;t part of our expe|dition. If we do not &s;ucceed to-morrow, we &s;hall probably follow his advice; but we are all determined to make a bold pu&s;h for it. The weather is the mo&s;t favourable that can be imagined: Here is a delightful evening; and by the &s;tar-light we can ob&s;erve the &s;moak rolling down the &s;ide of the mountain like a va&s;t torrent. Recupero &s;ays, this is a &s;ure indication of the violence of the cold in the&s;e exalted regions of the atmo&s;phere, which conden&s;es the vapour, and makes it fall down the moment it i&s;&s;ues out of the crater. He advi&s;es us, by all means, to provide plenty of <HI>liqueurs,</HI> warm fur cloaks, and hatchets to cut wood; as we &s;hall probably be obliged to pa&s;s the night in the open air, in a climate, he a&s;&s;ures us, as cold as that of

<P>ON the 27th, by day-break, we &s;et off to vi&s;it mount Aetna, that venerable and re&s;pectable father of mountains. His ba&s;e, and his immen&s;e declivities, are covered over with a numerous progeny of his own: For every great eruption produces a new mountain: and perhaps, by the number of the&s;e, better than by any other method, the number of eruptions, and the age of Aetna it&s;elf, might be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The whole mountain is divided into three di&s;tinct regions, called <HI>La Regione Culta,</HI> or <HI>Piedmonte&s;e,</HI> The fertile Region; <HI>la Regione Sylvo&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Nemoro&s;a,</HI> The woody Region; and <HI>la Regione De&s;erta,</HI> or <HI>Scoperta,</HI> The Barren Region.</P>
<P>The&s;e three are as different, both in climate and productions, as the three zones of the earth; and per|haps, with equal propriety, might have been &s;tiled the Torrid, the Temperate, and the Frigid zone. The fir&s;t region &s;urrounds the foot of the mountain, and con&s;titutes the mo&s;t fertile country in the world on all &s;ides of it, to the extent of about fourteen or fifteen
<PB N="85" REF="024150_0095_0FC3C3A11BD25850">
miles, where the woody region begins. It is compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of lava, which, after a number of ages, is at la&s;t converted into the mo&s;t fertile of all &s;oils.</P>
<P>At Nicolo&s;i, which is twelve miles up the mountain, we found the barometer at 27: 1&frac12;; at Catania it &s;tood at 29: 8&frac12;; although the former elevation is not very great, probably not exceeding 3000 feet, yet the climate was totally changed. At Catania the harve&s;t was entirely over, and the beats were in&s;upportable; here they were moderate, and in many places the corn is as yet green. The road for the&s;e twelve miles is the wor&s;t I ever travelled; entirely over old lavas and the mouths of extingui&s;hed volcanos, now converted into corn-fields, vineyards and orchards.</P>
<P>The fruit of this region is reckoned the fine&s;t in Sicily, particularly the figs, of which they have a great variety. One of the&s;e of a very large &s;ize, e&s;teemed &s;uperior in flavour to all the re&s;t, they pretend is peculiar to Aetna.</P>
<P>The lavas, which as I have already &s;aid form this region of the mountain, take their ri&s;e from an infinite number of the mo&s;t beautiful little mountains on earth, which are every where &s;cattered on the immen&s;e decliv|ity of Aetna. The&s;e are all of a regular figure; either that of a cone, or a &s;emi&s;phere; and all, but a very few, are covered with beautiful trees, and the riche&s;t verdure: Every eruption generally forms one of the&s;e mountains. As the great crater of Aetna it&s;elf is rai&s;ed to &s;uch an enormous height above the lower regions of the mountain, it is not po&s;&s;ible, that the internal fire raging for a vent, even round the ba&s;e, and no doubt va&s;tly below it, &s;hould be carried to the height of twelve or thirteen thou&s;and feet, for probably &s;o high is the
<PB N="86" REF="024150_0096_0FC3C3A29E2EBEE0">
&s;ummit of Aetna. It has therefore generally happened, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t after &s;haking the mountain and its neighbourhood for &s;ome time, it at la&s;t bur&s;ts open its &s;ide, and this is called an eruption. At fir&s;t it only &s;ends forth a thick &s;moke and &s;howers of a&s;hes that lay wa&s;te the adjacent country: The&s;e are &s;oon followed by red-hot &s;tones, and rocks of a great &s;ize, thrown to an immen&s;e height in the air. The fall of the&s;e &s;tones, together with quantities of a&s;hes di&s;charged at the &s;ame time, at la&s;t from the &s;pherical and conical mountains I have mentioned. Sometimes this proce&s;s is fini&s;hed in the cour&s;e of a few days, &s;ometimes it la&s;ts for months, which was the ca&s;e in the great eruption 1669. In that ca&s;e, the mountain formed is of a great &s;ize; &s;ome of them are not le&s;s than &s;even or eight miles round, and upwards of one thou&s;and feet in perpendic|ular height; others are not more than two or three miles round, and three or four hundred feet high.</P>
<P>After the new mountain is formed, the lava gener|ally bur&s;ts out from its lower &s;ide; and bearing every thing before it, is for the mo&s;t part terminated by the &s;ea. This is the common progre&s;s of an eruption; however, it &s;ometimes happens, though rarely, that the lava bur&s;ts at once from the &s;ide of the mountain, without all the&s;e attending circum&s;tances; and this is commonly the ca&s;e with the eruptions of Ve&s;uvius, where the elevation being &s;o much &s;maller, the melted matter is generally carried up into the crater of the mountain, which then exhibits the phaenomena I have de&s;cribed; di&s;charging &s;howers of &s;tones and a&s;hes from the mouth of the volcano without forming any new mountain but only adding con&s;iderably to the height of the old one; 'till at la&s;t the lava, ri&s;ing near the &s;ummit, bur&s;ts the &s;ide of the crater, and the eruption is declared. This has literally been the ca&s;e with two eruptions I
<PB N="87" REF="024150_0097_0FC3C3A4322F5DC8">
have been an attentive witne&s;s of in that mountain; but Aetna is upon a much larger &s;cale, and one crater is not enough to give vent to &s;uch oceans of liquid fire.</P>
<P>Rucupero a&s;&s;ures me, he &s;aw in an eruption of that mountain large rocks of fire di&s;charged to the height of &s;ome thou&s;and feet, with a noi&s;e much more terrible than that of thunder. He mea&s;ured from the time of their greate&s;t elevation 'till they reached the ground, and found they took twenty-one &s;econds to de&s;cend; which, according to the rule of the &s;paces, being as the squares of the times, amounts, I think, to upwards of 7000 feet. A mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing height &s;urely, and requiring a force of projection beyond what we have any conception of. I mea&s;ured the height of the explo&s;ions of Ve&s;uvius by the &s;ame rule, and never ob&s;erved any of the &s;tones thrown from it to take more than nine &s;econds to de&s;cend, which &s;hews they had ri&s;en to little more than 1200 feet.</P>
<P>Our landlord at Nicolo&s;i gave us an account of the &s;ingular fate of the beautiful country near Hybla, at no great di&s;tance from hence. It was &s;o celebrated for its fertility, and particularly for its honey, that it was called Mel Pa&s;&s;i, 'till it was overwhelmed by the lava of Aetna; and having then become totally barren, by a kind of pun its name was changed to Mal Pa&s;&s;i. In a &s;econd eruption, by a &s;hower of a&s;hes from the moun|tain, it &s;oon re-a&s;&s;umed its antient beauty and fertility; and for many years was called Bell Pa&s;&s;i. La&s;t of all, in the unfortunate aera of 1669, it was again laid under an ocean of fire, and reduced to the mo&s;t wretch|ed &s;terility, &s;ince which time it is known again by its &s;econd appellation of Mal Pa&s;&s;i. However, the lava, in its cour&s;e over this beautiful country, his left &s;everal little i&s;lands or hillocks; ju&s;t enough to shew what it
<PB N="88" REF="024150_0098_0FC3C008F8EB9438">
formerly was. The&s;e make a &s;ingular appearance, in all the bloom of the mo&s;t luxuriant vegetation, &s;urround|ed and rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by large fields of black and rugged lava. The mountain from whence the fir&s;t eruption i&s;&s;ued, that covered the Mel Pa&s;&s;i, is known by the name of Monpelieri; I was &s;truck with its beautiful appearance at a di&s;tance, and could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire I had of examining it minutely, as well as of ob&s;erving the effects of the two eruptions that overwhelmed this celebrated country.</P>
<P>Monpelieri is rather of a &s;pherical than a conical &s;hape, and does not ri&s;e in perpendicular height above 300 feet, but it is &s;o perfectly regular on every &s;ide, and &s;o richly over&s;pread with fruits and flowers, that I could not leave &s;o heavenly a &s;pot, without the greate&s;t regret. Its cup or crater is large in proportion to the mountain, and is as exactly hollowed out as the be&s;t made bowl. I walked quite round its outward edge, and think the circumference mu&s;t be &s;omewhat more than a mile.</P>
<P>This mountain was formed by the fir&s;t eruption that de&s;troyed the country of Mel Pa&s;&s;i, and is of a very old date. It buried a great number of villages and country hou&s;es; and particularly two noble churches, which are more regreted than all the re&s;t, on account of three &s;tatues, reckoned at that time the mo&s;t perfect in the i&s;land. They have attempted, but in vain, to recover them; as the &s;pot where the churches &s;tood could never be ju&s;tly a&s;certained. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;i|ble it &s;hould; for the&s;e churches were built of lava, which it is well known is immediately melted, when it comes into contact with a torrent of new, erupted matter: And Ma&s;&s;a, &s;ays, that in &s;ome eruptions of Aetna, the lava has poured down with &s;uch a &s;udden
<PB N="89" REF="024150_0099_0FC3C00AAAE5D790">
impetuo&s;ity, that in the cour&s;e of a few hours, churches, palaces, and villages, have been entirely melted down, and the whole run off in fu&s;ion without leaving the lea&s;t mark of their former exi&s;tence. But if the lava has had any con&s;iderable time to cool, this &s;ingular effect never happens.</P>
<P>The great eruption of 1669, after &s;haking the whole country around for four months, and forming a very large mountain of &s;tones and a&s;hes, bur&s;t out about a mile above Monpelieri, and de&s;cending like a torrent, bore directly again&s;t the middle of that mountain, and (they pretend) perforated it from &s;ide to &s;ide; this however I doubt, as it mu&s;t have broken the regular-form of the mountain, which is not the ca&s;e. But certain it is, that it pierced it to a great depth. The lava then divided into two branches; and &s;urrounding this mountain, joined again on its &s;outh &s;ide; and &s;aying wa&s;te the whole country betwixt that and Catania, &s;caled the walls of that city, and poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In its way, it is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of near 30,000 people, and reduced them to beggary. It formed &s;everal hills where there were formerly vallies, and filled up a large like, of which there is not now the least ve&s;tige to be &s;een.</P>
<P>As the events of this eruption are better known than any other, they tell a great many &s;ingular &s;tories of it; one of which, however incredible it may appear, is well a&s;certained. A vineyard, belonging to a convent of Je&s;uits, lay directly in its way. This vineyard was for; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> an ancient lava, probably a thin one, with a number of cavern and crevices under it. The liquid lava <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ring into the&s;e cavern, &s;oon filled them up, and by degrees bore up the vineyard, and the Je&s;uits,
<PB N="90" REF="024150_0100_0FC3C00BFB8E71D8">
who every moment expected to &s;ee it buried, beheld with amazement the whole field begin to move off. It was carried on the &s;urface of the lava to a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance; and though the greate&s;t part was de&s;troyed, yet &s;ome of it remains to this day.</P>
<P>We went to examine the mouth from whence this dreadful torrent i&s;&s;ued; and were &s;urpri&s;ed to find it only a &s;mall hole, of about three or four yards diameter. The mountain from whence it &s;prung, I think, is little le&s;s than the conical part of Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t cavern on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of it, where people go to &s;hoot wild pigeons, which breed there in great abundance. The innermo&s;t parts of this cavern are &s;o very di&s;mal and gloomy, that our landlord told us &s;ome people had lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es from having advanced too far, imagining they &s;aw devils and the &s;pirits of the damned; for it is &s;till very gener|ally believed here, that Aetna is the mouth of hell.</P>
<P>We found a degree of wildne&s;s and ferocity in the inhabitants of this mountain, that I have not ob&s;erved any where el&s;e. It put me in mind of an ob&s;ervation the Padre della Torre (the hi&s;toriographer of mount Ve&s;uvius) told me he had often made in the confines of Naples; that in the places where the air is mo&s;t impregnated with &s;ulphur and hot exhalations, the peo|ple were always mo&s;t wicked and vicious. Whatever truth there may be in the ob&s;ervation, the people about Nicolo&s;i at lea&s;t &s;eem to confirm it. The whole village flocked round us, and the women in particular abu&s;ed us exceedingly; the cau&s;e of which we at la&s;t found was that F&mdash;'s blooming complexion and white &s;kin had made them take him for one of their own &s;ex. They made a great clamour, and it was
<PB N="91" REF="024150_0101_0FC3C00D99653C68">
with difficulty we could appea&s;e them. The per&s;on whom Recupero had appointed to accompany us, known by the name of the Cyclops, (the man in the i&s;land that is be&s;t acquainted with mount Aetna) was ordered by them not to go with us; and if we had not at la&s;t obtained their con&s;ent by &s;oothing and flattery, the be&s;t method with women, he dur&s;t not have di&s;o|beyed them. At fir&s;t we had been obliged to &s;hut the gate of the court, they were &s;o very noi&s;y and tumultu|ous; but when our landlord (a prie&s;t) for whom we had letters from Catania, a&s;&s;ured them that we were Chri&s;t|ians, and came with no bad intentions, they became more moderate, &amp; we ventured out among&s;t them. This confidence &s;oon acquired theirs, and in a &s;hort time we became good friends, and had a great deal of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>It was with much difficulty I could per&s;uade them that we were not come to &s;earch for hidden trea&s;ures, a great quantity of which they believe is to be found in Monpelieri; and when I went to that mountain they were then fully convinced that this was our intention. Two of the men followed me, and kept a clo&s;e eye on every &s;tep that I took; and when I lifted any bit of lava or pumice, they came running up, thinking it was &s;omething very precious; but when they ob&s;erved they were only bits of &s;tone, and that I put them into my pocket, they laughed heartily, talking to one another in their mountain jargon, which is unintelligible even to Italians. However, as mo&s;t of them &s;peak Italian &s;o as to be under&s;tood, they a&s;ked me what I was going to make of tho&s;e bits of &s;tone? I told them they were of great value in our country; that the people there had a way of making gold of them: At this they both &s;eemed exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;poke again in their own tongue. However, I found they did not believe me; one of them told me, if that had been true, I
<PB N="92" REF="024150_0102_0FC3C00F139179C8">
certainly would not have been &s;o ready in telling it: But, &s;aid he, if it is &s;o, we will &s;erve you for ever, if you will teach us that art; for then we &s;hall be the riche&s;t people on earth. I a&s;&s;ured them that I had not yet learned it my&s;elf, and that it was a &s;ecret known only to a very few. They were likewi&s;e a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me pull out of my pocket a magnetical needle and a &s;mall electrometer, which I had prepared at Catania to examine the electrical &s;tate of the air; and I was at fir&s;t afraid they &s;hould have taken me for a conjurer (which you know already happened among&s;t the Appenines) but luckily that idea did not &s;trike them.</P>
<P>On our way back to Nicolo&s;i we were joined by three or four more, with their wives. I began to be a little afraid of my&s;elf, le&s;t they &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on know|ing the &s;ecret. However, I took out my bits of lava, and told them they were at their &s;ervice, if they had any occa&s;ion for them. But they refu&s;ed them, &s;aying, they wi&s;hed to the Virgin, and St. Agatha, that I could take away the whole of it; as it had ruined the fine&s;t country in all Sicily.</P>
<P>One fellow, who a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;uperior wi&s;dom and dignity to the re&s;t, made them form a circle round him, and began to interrogate me with great gravity and compo&s;ure. It was with difficulty I could keep my countenance; but as I was alone with them, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the village, I was afraid of offend|ing. He de&s;ired me to an&s;wer him with truth and preci&s;ion, what were the real motives of our coming &s;o fatiguing and di&s;agreeable a journey? I told him, on my word, that we had no other motive but curio&s;ity to examine mount Aetna. On which, laughing to one another with great contempt; <HI>Un bel ragione que&s;ta,
<PB N="93" REF="024150_0103_0FC3C0105E3732F0">
non &eacute; vero,</HI> &s;aid they (a very pretty rea&s;on, truly.) The old fellow then a&s;ked me what country we were of. I told him, we were <HI>Ingle&s;e. E dove loro pae&s;e?</HI> &s;aid he; whereabouts does their country lie? I told him it was a great way off, on the other &s;ide of the world. <HI>Da vero,</HI> &s;aid the fellow, <HI>e credono in Chri&s;to quelli Ingle&s;e?</HI> I told him (laughing) that they did. Ah, &s;aid he, &s;haking his head, <HI>mi pare che non credono troppo.</HI> One of the company then ob&s;erved, that he remember|ed &s;everal of the&s;e Ingle&s;e, that, at different times, bad paid vi&s;its to mount Aetna, and that they never yet could find out their motive; but that he recollected very well, to have heard many of their old people &s;ay, that the Ingle&s;e had a queen that had burnt in the mountain for many years pa&s;t; and that they &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e vi&s;its were made from &s;ome devotion or re&s;pect to her memory. I a&s;&s;ured them that the Ingle&s;e had but too little re&s;pect for their queens when they were alive, but that they never troubled them&s;elves about them after they were dead; however, as all the others confirmed this te&s;timony, I thought it was be&s;t to &s;ay little again&s;t it; but I was extremely curious to know who this queen might be. They alledged that I knew much better than they; but added, that her name was Anna.</P>
<P>I could not conceive what queen Anne had done to bring her there; and was puzzling my&s;elf to find it out; when one of them &s;oon cleared up the matter; he told me &s;he was wife to a king that had been a Chri&s;tian, and that &s;he had made him an Heretic, and was in con&s;equence condemned to burn for ever in mount Aetna. In &s;hort, I found it was no other than poor Anne Bolo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne. As &s;oon as I mentioned the name, <HI>Si &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or,</HI> &s;aid the fellow, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;le&s;&s;a, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;le&s;&s;a, la conno&s;ee meglio che noi.</HI> I a&s;ked, if her hu&s;band was

I thanked him, and went to join our company, not a little amu&s;ed with the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>We &s;oon after left Nicolo&s;i, and in an hour and a half's travelling, over barren a&s;hes and lava, we arri|ved on the confines of the Regione Sylvo&s;a, or the Temperate Zone. As &s;oon as we entered the&s;e delightful fore&s;ts, we &s;eemed to have got into another world. The air, which before was &s;ultry and hot, was now cool and refre&s;hing; and every breeze was loaded with a thou&s;and perfumes, the whole ground being covered over with the riche&s;t aromatic plants. Many parts of this region are &s;urely the mo&s;t heavenly &s;pots upon earth; and if Aetna re&s;embles hell within, it may with equal ju&s;tice be &s;aid to re&s;emble paradi&s;e without.</P>
<P>It is indeed a curious con&s;ideration, that this moun|tain &s;hould reunite every beauty and every horror; and in &s;hort, all the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite, and di&s;&s;imilar objects in nature. Here you ob&s;erve a gulph that formerly threw out torrents of fire, now covered with the mo&s;t luxuriant vegetation; and from an object of terror, become one of delight. Here you gather the mo&s;t delicious fruits, ri&s;ing from what was but lately a black and barren rock. Here the ground is covered with every flower; and we wander over th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e beauties, and con|template this wilderne&s;s of &s;weets, without con&s;idering that hell, with all its terrors, is immediately under our feet; and that but a few yards &s;eparate us from lakes of liquid fire and brimstone.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="024150_0105_0FC3C0135C7B5DD8">
But our a&s;toni&s;hment &s;till increa&s;es, on calling our eyes on the higher regions of the mountain. There we behold, in perpetual union, the two elements that are at perpetual war; an immen&s;e gulph of fire, for ever exi&s;ting in the mid&s;t of &s;nows, which it has not power to melt; and immen&s;e fields of &s;now and ice for ever &s;urrounding this gulph of fire, which they have not power to extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>The woody region of Aetna a&s;cends for about eight or nine miles and forms a zone or girdle, of the bright|e&s;t green, all around the mountain. This night we pa&s;&s;ed through little more than the half of it; arriving &s;ome time before &s;un-&s;et at our lodgings, which was no other than a large cave, formed by one of the mo&s;t ancient and venerable lavas. It is called <HI>La Spelonca del Capriole,</HI> or the goat's cavern, becau&s;e frequented by tho&s;e animals; who takes refuge there in bad weather.</P>
<P>Here we were delighted with the contemplation of many grave and beautiful objects; the pro&s;pect on all &s;ides is immen&s;e; and we already &s;eem to be lifted up from the earth, and to have got into a new world.</P>
<P>Our cavern is &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t &s;tately and maje&s;tic oaks; of the dry leaves of which, we made very comfortable beds; and with our hatchets, which we had brought on purpo&s;e, we had cut down great branches, and, in a &s;hort time, had a fire large enough to roa&s;t an ox. I ob&s;erved my thermometer, and found, from 71 at Nicolo&s;i, it had now fallen below 60. The barometer &s;tood at 24: 2. In one end of our cave we &s;till found a great quantity of &s;now, which &s;eemed to be &s;ent there on purpo&s;e for us, as there was no water to be found. With this we filled our tea-kettle, as tea and bread and butter was the only &s;upper
<PB N="96" REF="024150_0106_0FC3C014F8F78EA0">
we had provided; and probably the be&s;t one to prevent us from being overcome by &s;leep or fatigue.</P>
<P>Not a great way from this cavern, are two of the mo&s;t beautiful mountains of all that number that &s;pring from Aetna. I mounted one of our be&s;t mules, and with a good deal of difficulty arrived at the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t of them, ju&s;t a little before &s;un-&s;et. The pro&s;pect Sicily, with the &s;urrounding &s;ea and all its i&s;lands, was wonderfully noble. The whole cour&s;e of the river Semetus, the ruins of Hybla, and &s;everal other ancient towns; the rich corn-fields and vineyards on the lower region of the mountain, and the amazing number of beautiful mountains below, made a delight|ful &s;cene. The hollow craters of the&s;e two mountains are each of them con&s;iderably larger than that of Ve&s;uvius. They are now filled with &s;tately oaks, and covered to a great depth with the riche&s;t &s;oil. I ob&s;erved that this region of Aetna, like the former, is compo&s;ed of lava; but this is now covered &s;o deep with earth, that it is no where to be &s;een, but in the beds of the torrents. In many of the&s;e it is worn down by the water to the depth of fifty or &s;ixty feet, and in one of them &s;till con&s;iderably more.&mdash;What an idea does not this give of the amazing antiquity of the eruptions of this mountain!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was dark we retired to our cave, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our bed of leaves. Our re&s;t, how|ever, was &s;omewhat di&s;turbed by the noi&s;e of a moun|tain that lay a good way off on our right. It di&s;charged quantities of &s;moke, and made &s;everal explo&s;ions like heavy cannon at a di&s;tance; but what is &s;ingular, we could ob&s;erve no appearance of fire. This mountain was formed by an eruption 1766, now upwards of four years ago; the fire of which is not yet extingui&s;hed,
<PB N="97" REF="024150_0107_0FC3C01693E82548">
neither is the lava by any means cold. This lava &s;pent its fury on a delightful fore&s;t, which it laid wa&s;te to the extent of a good many miles. In many places it has run into gullies of a great depth, which it has filled up to the height, we are told, of 200 feet. It is in the&s;e places where it retains the greate&s;t heat. On our road to-day we &s;crambled up this lava, and went a con&s;iderable way over its &s;urface, which appeared per|fectly cold; but it is certain, that in many places it &s;till emits volumes of &s;moke, particularly after rain; and the people &s;ay, what lean readily believe, that this will continue to be the ca&s;e for &s;ome years where the lava is thicke&s;t. A &s;olid body of fire &s;ome hundreds of feet thick, and of &s;o great an extent, mu&s;t certainly retain its heat for many years. The &s;urface indeed &s;oon be|comes black and hard, and inclo&s;es the liquid fire with|in, in a kind of &s;olid box, excluding all impre&s;&s;ions from the external air or from the weather. Thus I have &s;een, many months after eruptions of mount Ve&s;u|vius, a bed of lava, though only of a few feet thick, has continued red hot in the center long after the &s;urface was cold; and a &s;tick thru&s;t into its crevices, in&s;tantly took fire, although there was no perceptible heat without.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;a, a Sicilian author of credit, &s;ays, he was at at Catania eight years after the great eruption in 1669, and that he &s;till found the lava in many places was not cold: But there is an ea&s;y method of calculating the time that bodies take to cool. Sir I&s;aac Newton, I think, in his account of the comet of 1680, &s;uppo&s;es the times to be as the &s;quares of their diameters: and finding that a &s;olid ball of metal of two inches, made red hot, required upwards of an hour to become perfectly cold, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le the calculation from that to a body of the diame|ter of the earth, and found it would require upwards of
<PB N="98" REF="024150_0108_0FC3C017F28307C0">
twenty thou&s;and years. If this rule be ju&s;t, you may ea&s;ily compute the time that the lava will take to become thoroughly cold; and that you may have time to do &s;o, I &s;hall here break off my letter, which I am obliged to write in bed, in a very aukward and di&s;a|greeable po&s;ture; the cau&s;e of which &s;hall be explained to you in my next.

<P>AFTER getting a comfortable nap on our bed of leaves in the Spelonca del Capriole, we awoke about eleven o'clock; and melting down a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;now<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we boiled our tea-kettle, and made a hearty meal, to prepare us for the remaining part of our expe|dition. We were nine in number; for we had our three &s;ervants, the Cyclops (our conductor) and two men to take care of our mules. The Cyclops now bagan to di&s;play his great knowledge of the mountain, and we followed him with implicit confidence. He conducted us "Antres va&s;t, and De&s;arts wild," where &s;carce human foot had ever trod. Sometimes through gloomy fore&s;ts, which by day-light were delightful; but now, from the univer&s;al darkne&s;s, the ru&s;tling of the trees, the heavy, dull, bellowing of the mountain, the va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean &s;tretched at an immen&s;e di&s;tance below us, in&s;pired a kind of awful horror. Sometimes we found our&s;elves a&s;cending great rocks of lava, where if our mules &s;hould make but a
<PB N="99" REF="024150_0109_0FC3C02112A97358">
fal&s;e &s;tep, we might be thrown headlong over the pre|cipice. However, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Cyclops, we overcame all the&s;e difficulties; and he managed matters &s;o well, that in the &s;pace of two hours, we found we had got above the regions of vegetation; and had left the fore&s;ts of Aetna far behind. The&s;e appear|ed now like a dark and gloomy gulph below us, that &s;urrounded the mountain.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect before us was of a very different nature; we beheld an expan&s;e of &s;now and ice that alarmed us exceedingly, and almo&s;t &s;taggered our re&s;o|lution. In the center of this, but &s;till at a great di&s;tance, we de&s;cried the high &s;ummit of the mountain, rearing its tremendous head, and vomiting out torrents of &s;moke. It indeed appeared altogether inacce&s;&s;ible, form the va&s;t extent of the fields of &s;now and ice that &s;urrounded it. Our diffidence was &s;till increa&s;ed by the &s;entiments of the Cyclops. He told us, it often happened, that the &s;urface of the mountain being hot below, melted the &s;now in particular &s;pots, and formed pools of water, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee our danger; that it likewi&s;e happened, that the &s;urface of the water, as well as the &s;now, was &s;ometimes covered with black a&s;hes, that rendered it exceedingly deceit|ful; that however, if we thought proper, he would lead us on with as much caution as po&s;&s;ible. Accord|ingly, after holding a council of war, which you know people generally do when they are very much afraid, we detached our cavalry to the fore&s;t below, and pre|pared to climb the &s;nows. The Cyclops, after taking a great draught of brandy, de&s;ired us to be of good cheer; that we had plenty of time, and might take as many re&s;ts as we plea&s;ed. That the &s;now could be little more than &s;even miles, and that we certainly &s;hould be able to pa&s;s it before &s;un-ri&s;e. Accordingly, taking
<PB N="100" REF="024150_0110_0FC3C021E5552100">
each of us a dram of liqueur, which &s;oon removed every objection, we began our march.</P>
<P>The a&s;cent for &s;ome time was not &s;teep; and as the &s;urface of the &s;now &s;unk a little, we had tolerable good footing; but as it &s;oon began to grow &s;teeper, we found our labour greatly increa&s;e: However, we determined to per&s;ever, calling to mind in the mid&s;t of our labour, that the emperor Adrian and the philo&s;opher Plato had undergone that &s;ame; and from the &s;ame motive too, to &s;ee the ri&s;ing &s;un from the top of Aetna. After in|credible labour and fatigue, but at the &s;ame time mixed with a great deal of plea&s;ure, we arrived before dawn at the ruins of an ancient &s;tructure, called <HI>Il Torre del Filo&s;ofo,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the philo&s;opher Empedocles, who took up his habitation here the better to &s;tudy the nature of mount Aetna. By others it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ruins of a temple of Vulcan, who&s;e &s;hop, all the world knows (where he u&s;ed to make excellent thunderbolts and cele&s;tial armour, as well as nets to catch his wife when &s;he went a&s;tray) was ever kept in mount Aetna. Here we re&s;ted our|&s;elves for &s;ome time, and made a fre&s;h application to our liqueur bottle, which I am per&s;uaded, both Vulcan and Empedocles, had they been here, would have greatly approved of after &s;uch a march.</P>
<P>I found the mercury had fallen to 20: 6. We had now time to pay our adorations in a &s;ilent contempla|tion of the &s;ublime objects of nature. The &s;ky was clear, and the immen&s;e vault of the heavens appeared in awful maje&s;ty and &s;plendor. We found our&s;elves more &s;truck with veneration than below, and at fir&s;t were at a lo&s;s to know the cau&s;e; 'till we ob&s;erved with a&s;toni&s;hment, that the number of &s;tars &s;eemed to be infinitely increa&s;ed; and the light of each of them ap|peared brighter than u&s;ual. The whitene&s;s of the milky way was like a pure flame that &s;hot acro&s;s the heavens;
<PB N="101" REF="024150_0111_0FC3C02351F4FC20">
and with the naked eye we could ob&s;erve clu&s;ters of &s;tars that were invi&s;ible in the regions below. We did not at fir&s;t attend to the cau&s;e, nor recollect that we had now pa&s;&s;ed through ten or twelve thou&s;and feet of gro&s;s vapour, that blunts and confu&s;es every ray, before it reaches the &s;urface of the earth. We were amazed at the di&s;tinctne&s;s of vi&s;ion, and exclaim|ed together, What a glorious &s;ituation for an ob&s;erva|tory! Had Empedocles had the eyes of Gallileo what di&s;coveries mu&s;t he not have made! We regretted that Jupiter was not vi&s;ible, as I am per&s;uaded we might have di&s;covered &s;ome of his &s;atellites with the naked eye, or at lea&s;t with a &s;mall gla&s;s which I had in my pocket. We ob&s;erved a light a great way below us on the mountain, which &s;eemed to move among&s;t the fore&s;ts, but whether an Ignus Fatuus, or what it was, I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay. We likewi&s;e took notice of &s;everal of tho&s;e meteors called Falling-Stars, which &s;till appeared to be as much elevated above us, as when &s;een from the plain; &s;o that in all probability; tho&s;e bodies move in regions much beyond the bounds that &s;ome philo&s;ophers have a&s;&s;igned to our atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>After cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mplating the&s;e objects for &s;ome time, we &s;et off, and &s;oon after arrived at the foot of the great crater of the mountain&punc; This is of an exact conical figure, and ri&s;es equally on all &s;ides. It is compo&s;ed &s;olely of a&s;hes and other burnt materials, di&s;charged from the mouth of the volcano, which is in its centre. This conical mountain is of a very great &s;ize; its circumference cannot be le&s;s than ten miles. Here we took a &s;econd re&s;t, as the greate&s;t part of our fatigue &s;till remained. The mercury had fallen to 20: 4&frac12;. &mdash;We found this mountain exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep; and although it had appeared black, yet it was likewi&s;e covered with &s;now, but the &s;urface (luckily for us) was
<PB N="102" REF="024150_0112_0FC3C024B5A3B080">
&s;pread over with a pretty think layer of a&s;hes, thrown out from the crater. Had it not been for this, we never &s;hould have been able to get to the top; as the &s;now was every where frozen hard and &s;olid, from the piercing cold of the air.</P>
<P>In about an hour's climbing, we arrived at a place where there was no &s;now; and where a warm and comfortable vapour i&s;&s;ued from the mountain, which induced us to make another halt. Here I found the mercury at 19: 6&frac12;. The thermometer was fallen three degrees below the point of congelation; and before we left the &s;ummit of Aetna, it fell two degrees more, viz. to 27.&mdash;From this &s;pot it was only about 300 yards to the highe&s;t &s;ummit of the mountain, where we arrived in full time, to &s;ee the mo&s;t wonderful and mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;ight in nature.</P>
<P>But here de&s;cription mu&s;t ever fall &s;hort; for no imagination has dared to from an idea of &s;o glorious and &s;o magnificent a &s;cene. Neither is three on the &s;urface of this globe, any one point that unites &s;o many awful and &s;ublime objects.&mdash;The immen&s;e elevation from the &s;urface of the earth, drawn as it were to a &s;ingle point, without any neighbouring mountain for the &s;en&s;es and imagination to re&s;t upon; and recover from their a&s;toni&s;hment in their way down to the world. This point or pinnacle, rai&s;ed on the brink of bottom|le&s;s gulph, as old as the world, often di&s;charging rivers of fire, and throwing out burning rocks, with a noi&s;e that &s;hakes the whole i&s;land. Add to this, the unbounded extent of the pro&s;pect, comprehending the greate&s;t diver&s;ity and mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery in nature; with the ri&s;ing &s;un, advancing in the ea&s;t, to illuminate the wondrous &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="024150_0113_0FC3C02CD7D1B3B8">
The whole atmo&s;phere by degrees kindled up, and &s;hewed dimly and faintly the boundle&s;s pro&s;pect around. Both &s;ea and land looked dark and confu&s;ed, as if only emerging from their original chaos; and light and darkne&s;s &s;eemed &s;till undivided; till the morning by degrees advancing, completed the &s;eparation. The &s;tars are extingui&s;hed, and the &s;hades di&s;appear. The fore&s;ts, which but now &s;eemed black and bottomle&s;s gulphs, from whence no ray was reflected to &s;hew their form or colours, appear a new creation ri&s;ing to the &s;ight; catching life and beauty from every increa&s;ing beam. The &s;cene &s;till enlarges, and the horizon &s;eems to widen and expand it&s;elf on all &s;ides: 'till the &s;un, like the great Creator, appears in the ea&s;t, and with his pla&s;tic ray completes the mighty &s;cene.

The body of the &s;un is &s;een ri&s;ing from the ocean, immen&s;e tracts both of &s;ea and land intervening; the i&s;lands of Lipari, Panari, Alicudi, Strombolo, and Volcano, with their &s;moaking &s;ummits, appear under your feet; and you look down on the whole of Sicily as on a map; and can trace every river through all its windings, from its &s;ource to its mouth. The view is ab&s;olutely boundle&s;s on every &s;ide; nor is there any one object, within the circle of vi&s;ion, to in|terrupt it; &s;o that the &s;ight is every where lo&s;t in the immen&s;ity: And I am per&s;uaded it is only from the imperfection of our organs, that the coa&s;ts of Africa, and even of Greece, are not di&s;covered, as they are certainly above the horizon on the top of Aetna cannot be le&s;s than 2000 miles: At Malta, which is near 200 miles

It is marked out by a circle of &s;now and ice, which extends on all &s;ides to the di&s;tance of about eight miles. In the center of this circle, the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rater of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he contain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears its burning head, and the regions of inten&s;e cold and

and of inten&s;e heat &s;eem for ever to be united in the &s;ame point.&mdash;On the north &s;ide of the &s;nowy region, they a&s;&s;ure us, there are &s;everal &s;mall lakes that are never thawed; and that in many places, the &s;now, mixed with the a&s;hes and &s;alts of the mountain, is accumulated to a va&s;t depth: And indeed I &s;uppo&s;e the quantity of &s;alts contained in this mountain, is one great rea&s;on of the pre&s;ervation of its &s;nows. The <HI>Regione De&s;erta</HI> is immediately &s;ucceeded by the <HI>Sylvo&s;a,</HI> or the woody region; which forms a circle or girdle of the mo&s;t beautiful green, which &s;urrounds the mountain on all &s;ides, and is certainly one of the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots on earth. This pre&s;ents a remarkable contra&s;t with the de&s;ert region. It is not &s;mooth and even like the greate&s;t part of the latter; but it is finely variegated by an infinite number of tho&s;e beautiful little mountains that have been formed by the different eruptions of Aetna. All the&s;e have now acquired a wonderful degree of fertility, except a very few that are but newly formed; that is, within the&s;e five or &s;ix hundred years: For it certainly requires &s;ome thou&s;ands to bring them to their greate&s;t degree of perfection. We looked down into the craters of the&s;e, and attempted, but in vain, to number them.</P>
<P>The circumference of this zone or great circle on Aetna is not lets than 70 or 80 miles. It is every where &s;ucceeded by the vineyards, orchards, and corn|fields that compo&s;e the <HI>Regione Cult&agrave;,</HI> or the fertile region. This la&s;t zone is much broader than the others, and extends on all &s;ides to the foot of the mountain. Its whole circumference, according to Recupero, is 183 miles. It is likewise covered with a number of little conical and &s;pherical mountains, and exhibits a wonderful variety of forms and colours, and makes a delightful contra&s;t with the other two regions.
<PB N="106" REF="024150_0116_0FC3C03F22577D18">
It is bounded by the &s;ea to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, and on all its other &s;ides by the rivers Semetus and Alcantara, which run almo&s;t round it. The whole cour&s;e of the&s;e rivers is &s;een at once, and all their beautiful windings through the&s;e fertile vallies, looked upon as the favourite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ceres her&s;elf, and the very &s;cene of the rape of her daughter Pro&s;erpine.</P>
<P>Ca&s;t your eyes a little farther, and you embrace the whole i&s;land, and &s;ee all its cities, rivers and mountains, deleinated in the great chart of nature: All the adjacent i&s;lands, the whole coa&s;t of Italy, as far as your eye can reach; for it is no where bounded, but every where lo&s;t in the &s;pace. On the &s;un's fir&s;t ri&s;ing, the &s;hadow of the mountain extends acro&s;s the whole i&s;land, and makes a large tract vi&s;ible even in the &s;ea and in the air. By degrees this is &s;hortened, and, in a little time, is confined only to the neighbourhood of Aetna.</P>
<P>We now had time to examine a fourth region of this wonderful mountain, very different, indeed, from the others, and productive of very different &s;en&s;ations; but which has, undoubtedly, given being to all the re&s;t; I mean the region of fire.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent crater of this immen&s;e volcana is a circle of about three miles and a half in circumference. It goes &s;helving down on each &s;ide, and forms a regular hollow like a va&s;t amphitheatre. From many places of this &s;pace, i&s;&s;ue volumes of &s;ulphureous &s;moke, which, being much heavier than the circuma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bient air, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing in it, as &s;moke generally does, imme|diately on its getting out of the crater, rolls down the &s;ide of the mountain like a torrent, 'till coming to that part of the atmo&s;phere of the &s;ame &s;pecific gravity
<PB N="107" REF="024150_0117_0FC3C04084E41728">
with it&s;elf, it &s;hoots off horizontally, and forms a large tract in the air, according to the direction of the wind; which, happily for us, carried it exactly to the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to that where we were placed. The crater is &s;o hot, that it is very dangerous, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to go down into it; be&s;ides, the &s;moke is very incom|modious, and, in many places, the &s;urface is &s;o &s;oft, there have been in&s;tances of people &s;inking down in it, and paying for their temerity with their lives. Near the center of the crater is the great mouth of the volcano. That tremendous gulph &s;o celebrated in all ages, looked upon as the terror and &s;courge both of this and another life; and equally u&s;eful to ancient poets, or to modern divines, when the mu&s;e or when the Spirit in&s;pires. We beheld with awe and with horror, and were not &s;urpri&s;ed that it had been con&s;idered as the place of the damned. When we reflect on the immen&s;ity of its depth, the va&s;t cells and caverns whence &s;o many lavas have i&s;&s;ued; the force of its internal fire, to rai&s;e up tho&s;e lavas to &s;o va&s;t a height, to &s;upport it as it were in the air, and even force it over the very &s;ummit of the crater, with all the dreadful accompaniments; the boiling of the matter, the &s;ha|king of the mountain, the explo&s;ions of &s;laming rocks, &amp;c. we mu&s;t allow, that the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagi|nation, in the mid&s;t of all its terrors, hardly ever form|ed an idea of a hell more dreadful.</P>
<P>It was with a mixture both of plea&s;ure and pain, that we quitted this awful &s;cene. But the wind had ri&s;en very high, and clouds began to gather round the mountain: In a &s;hort time they formed like another heaven below us, and we were in hopes of &s;eeing a thunder-&s;torm under our feet: A &s;cene that is not uncommon in the&s;e exalted regions, and which I have already &s;een on the top of the high Alps. But the
<PB N="108" REF="024150_0118_0FC3C041F3425C38">
clouds were &s;oon di&s;pelled again by the force of the wind, and we were di&s;appointed in our expectations.</P>
<P>I had often been told of the great effect produced by di&s;charging a gun on the top of high mountains. I tried it here, when we were a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the &s;ound, it was almo&s;t reduced to nothing. The report was not equal to that of a pocket-pi&s;tol: We compared it to the &s;troke of a &s;tick on a door; and &s;urely it is con&s;i&s;tent with rea|&s;on, that the thinner the air is, the le&s;s its impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be on the ear; for in a vacuum, there can be no noi&s;e, or no impre&s;&s;ion can be made; and the nearer the approach to a vacuum, the impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t always be the &s;maller. Where tho&s;e great effects have been produced, it mu&s;t have been among&s;t a number of mountains, where the &s;ound is reverberated from one to the other.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the foot of the cone, we ob&s;erv|ed &s;ome rocks of an incredible &s;ize, that have been di&s;|charged from the crater. The large&s;t that has been ob&s;erved from Ve&s;uvius, is a round one of about twelve feet diameter. The&s;e are much greater; indeed almo&s;t in proportion of the mountains to each other.</P>
<P>On our arrival at the Torre del Filo&s;ofo, we could not help admiring, that the ruins of this &s;tructure have remained uncovered for &s;o many ages, &s;o near the top of Aetna, when thou&s;ands of places at a great di&s;tance from it, have been repeatedly buried by its lavas in a much &s;horter time. A proof that few eruptions have ri&s;en &s;o high in the mountain.</P>
<P>Empedocles was a native of Agrigentum, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died 400 years before the Chri&s;tian

aera. Perhaps his vanity more than his philo&s;ophy led him to this elevated &s;ituation; nay, it is &s;aid to have carried him &s;till much farther: That he might be looked upon as a god, and that the people might &s;up|po&s;e he was taken up to heaven, he is recorded to have thrown him&s;elf headlong into the great gulph of mount Aetna, never &s;uppo&s;ing that his death could be di&s;cov|ered to mankind; but the treacherous mountain threw out his &s;lippers, which were of bra&s;s, and announced to the world the fate of the philo&s;opher, who, by his death, as well as life, wanted only to impo&s;e upon mankind, and make them believe that he was greater than they.</P>
<P>However, if there is &s;uch a thing as philo&s;ophy on earth, this &s;urely ought to be its &s;eat. The pro&s;pect is little inferior to that from the &s;ummit; and the mind enjoys a degree of &s;erenity here, that even few philo&s;o|phers, I believe, could ever boa&s;t of on that tremendous point.&mdash;All nature lies expanded below your feet, in her gaye&s;t and mo&s;t luxuriant dre&s;s, and you &s;till behold united under one point of view, all the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and all the climates of the earth. The meditations are ever elevated in proportion to the grandeur and &s;ublimity of the objects that &s;urround us: and here, where you have all nature to arou&s;e your admiration, what mind can remain inactive?</P>
<P>It has likewi&s;e been ob&s;erved, and from experience I can &s;ay with truth; that on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, where the air is &s;o pure and refined; and where there is not that immen&s;e weight of gro&s;s vapours pre&s;&s;ing upon the body; the mind acts with greater freedom, and all the functions both of &s;oul and body are performed in a &s;uperior manner. It would appear, that in proportion as we are rai&s;ed above the habitations of men, all low and vulgar &s;entiments are
<PB N="110" REF="024150_0120_0FC3C044D6DA7E90">
left behind; and that the &s;oul, in approaching the aetheral regions, &s;hakes off its earthly affections, and already acquires &s;omething of their cele&s;tial purity.&mdash;Here, where you &s;tand under a &s;erene &s;ky, and behold, with equal &s;erenity, the tempe&s;t and &s;torm forming below your feet: The lightning, darting from cloud to cloud, and the thunder rolling round the mountain, and threatning with de&s;truction the poor wretches below; the mind con&s;iders the little &s;torms of the human pa&s;&s;ions as equally below her notice.&mdash;Surely the &s;ituation alone, is enough to in&s;pire philo&s;o|phy, and Empedocles had good rea&s;on for chu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>But, alas! How vain are all our rea&s;onings; in the very mid&s;t of the&s;e meditations, my philo&s;ophy was at once over&s;et, and in a moment I found my&s;elf relap&s;ed into a poor mi&s;erable mortal; was obliged to own, that pain was the greate&s;t of evils; and would have given the world to have been once more arrived at tho&s;e humble habitations, which but a moment before, I had looked down upon with &s;uch contempt.&mdash;In running over the ice, my leg folded under me, and I received &s;o violent a &s;prain, that in a few minutes it &s;welled to a great degree, and I found my&s;elf unable to put my foot to the ground. Every mu&s;cle and fibre was at the time chilled and froze by the extreme cold, the thermometer continuing &s;till below the point of congelation. It was this circum&s;tance, I &s;uppose, that made the pain &s;o violent; for I lay a con&s;iderable time on the ice in great agony: However, in the&s;e exalted regions, it was impo&s;&s;ible to have a hor&s;e, or a carriage of any kind; and your poor philo&s;opher was obliged to hop on one leg, with two men &s;upporting him for &s;everal miles over the &s;now; and our wags here alledge, that he left the greate&s;t part of his philo&s;ophy behind him, for the u&s;e of Empedocles's heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="024150_0121_0FC3C0468359AE68">
I was happy to get to my mule, but when I once more found my&s;elf on our bed of leaves in the Spelonca del Capriole, I thought I was in paradi&s;e: So true it is, that a removal of pain is the greate&s;t of plea&s;ures. The agony I &s;uffered, had thrown me into a profu&s;e &s;w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t and fever; however, in an in&s;tant I fell fa&s;t a&s;leep, and in an hour and a half, awaked in perfect health. We had an excellent di&s;h of tea, the mo&s;t refre&s;hing and agreeable I ever drank in all my life.</P>
<P>We left the &s;ummit of the mountain about 6 o'clock, and it was eight at night before we reached Catania. We ob&s;erved, both with plea&s;ure and pain, the change of the climate as we de&s;cended.&mdash;From the regions of the mo&s;t rigid winter, we &s;oon arrived at tho&s;e of the mo&s;t delightful &s;pring. On fir&s;t entering the for|e&s;ts, the trees were &s;till bare as in December, not a &s;ingle leaf to be &s;een; but after we had de&s;cended a few miles, we found our&s;elves in the milde&s;t, and the &s;oftest of climates; the trees in full verdure, and the fields covered with all the flowers of the &s;ummer; but as &s;oon as we got out of the woods, and entered the torrid zone, we found the heats altogether in&s;upportable, and city. On the road I &s;aw many mountains which I Intended to have vi&s;ited, but my &s;prain put it out of my power. One of the mo&s;t remarkable is called the <HI>Monte Pellu&s;e,</HI> the lava of which de&s;troyed the great aqueduct of Catania for eighteen miles. It has here and there left a few arches; but nothing of any con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>Not far from this mountain &s;tands the <HI>Monte Victo|ria,</HI> one of the mo&s;t beautiful of all the numerous family of Aetna. It is of a pretty large &s;ize, and per|fectly regular, and &s;eems to be in the gaye&s;t dre&s;s of any.
<PB N="112" REF="024150_0122_0FC3C048AFA474F8">
Many of its trees, which, at a di&s;tance, we took to be oranges and citrons, appeared to be in full blow. It was the lava of this mountain that is &s;aid to have cov|ered up the port of Uly&s;&s;es, which is now three miles di&s;tant from the &s;ea; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this eruption to have been much older than either Uly&s;&s;es or Troy.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Catania, we went immediately to bed, being exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ed by the fatigue of our expedition; but &s;till more by the violent heat of the day: A day, in which, I think, I have enjoyed a great|er degree of plea&s;ure, and &s;uffered a greater degree of pain, than any other day of my life.</P>
<P>As my leg continues very much &s;welled, I am &s;till confined to my room, and mo&s;tly, indeed, to my bed, from whence I have written you the greate&s;t part of the&s;e two epi&s;tles, the enormous length of which I am a&s;hamed of. However, as I have &s;till omitted &s;eve|ral articles, that I intended to take notice of, I &s;hall add a &s;equel to-morrow; and &s;o conclude my account of mount Aetna.

<P>WE took care to regulate two barometers at the foot of the mountain. One of which was left with the Canonico Recupero, and the other we carried along

with us. The former our friend a&s;&s;ures us, had no &s;ensible variation during our ab&s;ence. We both left it and found it at 29 inches 8 lines and a half, Engli&s;h mea&s;ure. On our arrival at Catania, the one we carri|ed up with us had ri&s;en again exactly to the &s;ame point.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e a good quick&s;ilver thermometer, which I borrowed from the Neapolitan Philo&s;opher, the Padre della Torre, who furni&s;hed us with letters for this place, and would have accompanied us, could he have obtained leave of the king. It is made by Adams at London, and (as I my&s;elf proved) exactly graduated from the two points of freezing and boiling water. It is upon Fahrenheit's &s;cale. I &s;hall mark the heights in the different regions of Aetna, with the rules for e&s;timating the elevation of mountains by the barometer, which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, have been hitherto &s;o very ill a&s;certained. Ca&s;&s;ini, Boguer, and the others who have written on the &s;ubject, to the reproach of &s;cience, differing &s;o much among&s;t them&s;elves, that it is with difficulty we can come near the truth.</P>
<P>Aetna has been often mea&s;ured, but I believe never with any degree of accuracy; and it is really a &s;hame; to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ciety e&s;tabli&s;hed in this place, called the Aetnean Academy, who&s;e original in&s;titution was to &s;tudy the nature and operations of this wonderful mountain. It was my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ull intention to have mea&s;ured it geometrically; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay; although this is both the &s;ent of an Academy and Univer&s;ity, yet there was no quadran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be had. Of all the mountains I have ever &s;een, Aetna would be the ea&s;ie&s;t to mea&s;ure, and with the greate&s;t certainty, and perhaps the proper|e&s;t place on the globe to e&s;tabli&s;h an exact rule of me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tion b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the barometer. There is a beach of a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t extent that begins exactly at the foot of the moun|tain,
<PB N="114" REF="024150_0124_0FC3C04B8AEEA520">
and runs for a great many miles along the coa&s;t&punc; The &s;ea-mark of this beach forms the meridian to the &s;ummit of the mountain. Here you are &s;ure of a perfect level, and may make the ba&s;e of your triangle of what length you plea&s;e. But unfortunately this men&s;uration has never been executed, at lea&s;t with any tolerable degree of preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Kircher pretends to have mea&s;ured it, and to have found it 4000 French toi&s;es in height; which is more than any of the Andes, or indeed than any mountain upon earth. The Italian mathematicians are &s;till more ab&s;urd. Some of them make it eight miles, &s;ome &s;ix, and &s;ome four. Amici, the la&s;t, and I believe the be&s;t who has made the attempt, reduces it to three miles, 264 paces; but even this mu&s;t be exceedingly errone|ous; and probably the perpendicular height of Aetna does not exceed 12000 feet, or little more than two miles. I &s;hall mark the different methods of determin|ing heights by the barometer; and you may chu&s;e which you plea&s;e. I believe the allowance in all of them, particularly in great elevations, where the air is &s;o exceedingly thin and light, is much too &s;mall. Mikeli, who&s;e men&s;urations are e&s;teemed more exact, has ever found it &s;o. Ca&s;&s;ini allows, I think, ten French toi&s;es of elevation, for every line of mercury, adding one foot to the fir&s;t ten, two to the &s;econd, three to the third, and &s;o on: But &s;urely the weight of the air dimini&s;hes in a much greater proportion.</P>
<P>Boguer takes the difference of the logarithms of the height of the barometer in lines (&s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e loga|rithms to con&s;i&s;t only of five figures;) from this dif|ference he takes away a 30th part, and what remains he &s;uppo&s;es to be the difference of elevation. I do not recollect his rea&s;on for this &s;uppo&s;ition; but the rule
<PB N="115" REF="024150_0125_0FC3C04CCE398E48">
&s;eems to be &s;till more erroneous than the other, and has been entirely laid a&s;ide. I am told, that accurate experiments have been made at Geneva, to e&s;tabli&s;h the men&s;uration with barometer; but I have not yet been able to procure them. Mr. de la Hire allows twelve toi&s;es, four feet, for the line of mercury: And Picart, one of the mo&s;t extract of the French academi|cians, fourteen toi&s;es, or about ninety Engli&s;h feet.</P>

<P>I own I did not believe we &s;hould find Aetna &s;o high. I had heard indeed that it was higher than any of the Alps, but I never gave credit to it: How great then was my a&s;toni&s;hment to find that the mercury fell almo&s;t two inches lower than I had ever ob&s;erved it on the very highe&s;t of the acce&s;&s;ible Alps; at the &s;ame time I am per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed there are many inacce&s;&s;ible points of the Alps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">cularly (Mont.

<P>I found the magnetical needle greatly agitated near the &s;ummit of the mountain; (the Padre dello Torre told me, he had made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation on Ve&s;uvi|us) however, it always fixed at the north point, tho' it took longer time in fixing than below. But what Recupero told me happened to him, was very was very &s;ingular. Soon after the eruption 1775, he placed his compa&s;s on the lava.

The wind, and my unfortunate &s;prain together, in a great mea&s;ure prevented our electrical experiments, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n which we had built not a little; however, I found that round Nicolo&s;i, and particularly on the top of Nonpelieri, the air was in a very favourable &s;tate for electrical operations. Here the little pith-balls, when in&s;olated, were &s;en&s;ibly affected, and repelled each other above an inch. I expected this electrical &s;tate of the air would have increa&s;ed as we advanced on the mountain; but at the cave where we &s;lept, I could ob&s;erve no &s;uch effect. Perhaps, it was owing to the exhalations from the trees and vegetables, which are there exceedingly luxuriant; whereas about Nicolo&s;i, and round Monpelieri, there is hardly any thing but lava and dry hot &s;and.&mdash;Or perhaps it might be owing to the evening being farther advanced, and the dews beginning to fall. However, I have no doubt, that upon the&s;e mountains formed by eruption, where the air is &s;trongly impregnated with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bureous efflu|via, great electrical di&s;coveries might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ade. And perhaps, of all the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for the wonderful vegetation that is performed on this mountain, there is none that contributes &s;o much towards it, as this con&s;tant electrical &s;tate of the air: For from a variety of experiments it has been found, that an increa&s;e of the electrical matter adds much to the progre&s;s of vegetation. It probably acts there in the &s;ame man|ner as on the animal body; the circulation we know is performed quicker; and the juices are driven through the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els with more ea&s;e and celerity. This has often been proved from the immediate removal of ob&s;tructions by electricity; and probably the rubbing with dry and warm flannel, e&s;teemed &s;o efficacious in &s;uch ca&s;es, is doing nothing more than exciting a greater degree of electricity in the part; but it has likewi&s;e been demon&s;trated, by the common experi|ment

of making water drop through a &s;mall capillary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yphon, which the moment it is electrified runs in a full &s;tream.

<P>Electricity will probably &s;oon be con&s;idered as the great vivifying principle of nature, by which &s;he car|ries on mo&s;t of her operations. It is a fifth element, di&s;tinct from, and of a superior nature to the other four, which only compo&s;e the corporeal parts of matter: But this &s;ubtle and active fluid is a kind of a &s;oul that pervades and quickens every particle of it. When an equal quantity of this is diffu&s;ed through the air, and over the face of the earth, every thing continues calm and quiet; but if by any accident one part of matter has acquired a greater quantity than another, the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences often en&s;ue before the equilibri|um, can be re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed.

And again, if we look down from the &s;ublime of nature to its minutiae, we &s;hall &s;till find the &s;ame power acting; though perhaps in le&s;&s; legible characters; for as the knowledge of its operations is &s;till in its infancy, they are generally mi&s;under&s;tood, or a&s;cribed to &s;ome other cau&s;e. However, I have no doubt, that in proce&s;s of time the&s;e will be properly inve&s;tigated; when mankind will wonder how much they have been in the dark. It will then po&s;&s;ibly be found, that what we call &s;en&s;ibility of nerves, and many of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es that the faculty have as yet only invented names for, are owing to the body's being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too large or too &s;mall a quantity of this

&s;ubtle and active fluid; that very fluid, perhaps, that is the vehicle of all our feelings; and which they have &s;o long &s;earched for in vain in the nerves: For I have &s;ometimes been led to think, that this &s;en&s;e was nothing el&s;e than a &s;lighter kind of electric effect, to which the nerves &s;erve as conductors; and that it is by the rapid circulation of this penetrating and animating fire that our &s;en&s;ations are performed. We all know, that in damp and hazy weather, when it &s;eems to be blunted and ab&s;orbed by the humidity; when its activity is lo&s;t, and little or none of it can be collected; we ever find our &s;pirits more languid, and our &s;en&s;ibility le&s;s acute: but in the &s;irocc wind at Naples, when the air &s;eems totally deprived of it, the whole &s;y&s;tem is un&s;trung, and the nerves &s;eem to lo&s;e both their ten&s;ion and ela&s;ticity, 'till the north or we&s;t wind awakens the activity of this animating power, which &s;oon re&s;tores the tone, and enlivens all nature, which &s;eemed to droop and langui&s;h during its ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e well known, that ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have been in&s;tances of the human body becoming electric without the mediation of any electric &s;ub&s;tance, and even emitting &s;parks of fire with a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and an extreme degree of nervous &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>About &s;even or eight years ago, a lady in Switzerland was affected in this manner, and though I was not able to learn all the particulars of her ca&s;e, yet &s;everal Swi&s;s gentlemen have confirmed to me the truth of the &s;tory.&mdash;She was uncommonly &s;en&s;ible of every change of weather, and had her electrical feelings &s;tronge&s;t in a clear day, or during the pa&s;&s;age of thunder-clouds, when the air is known to be replete with that fluid. Her ca&s;e like most others which the doctors can make nothing of, was decided to be a <HI>nervous</HI> one, for the

real meaning of that term I take to be only, that the phy&s;ician does not under&s;tand what it is.</P>
<P>Two gentlemen of Geneva had a &s;hort experience of the &s;ame &s;ort of complaint, though &s;till in a much &s;upe|rior degree. Profe&s;&s;or Sau&s;&s;ure and young Mr. Jala|bert, when travelling over one of the high Alps, were caught among&s;t thunder-clouds; and to their utter a&s;toni&s;hment, found their bodies &s;o full of electrical fire, that &s;pontaneous fla&s;hes darted from their fingers with a crackling noi&s;e, and the &s;ame kind of &s;en&s;ation as when &s;trongly electrified by art. This was communi|cated by Mr. Jalabert to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, I think, in the year 1763; and you will find it recorded in their memoirs.</P>
<P>It &s;eems pretty evident, I think, that the&s;e feelings were owing to the bodies being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too great a &s;hare of electric fire. This is an uncommon ca&s;e; but I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it at all improbable, that many of our invalids, particularly the hypochondriac, and tho&s;e we call <HI>Malades Imaginaires,</HI> owe their di&s;agreeable feelings to the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e, or the bodies being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of too &s;mall a quantity of this fire; for we find that a diminution of it in the air &s;eldom fails to increa&s;e their unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it might be of &s;ervice to the&s;e people to wear &s;ome electric &s;ub&s;tance next to their &s;kin, to defend the nerves and fibres from the damp, or non-electric air. I would propo&s;e a wai&s;tcoat of the fine&s;t flannel, which &s;hould be kept perfectly clean and dry; for the effluvia of the body, in ca&s;e of any violent per&s;piration, will &s;oon de&s;troy its electric quality: This &s;hould be covered by another of the &s;ame &s;ize of &s;ilk.

<P>As for our Swi&s;s lady, I have little doubt that her complaints were owing in great part, perhaps entirely, to her dre&s;s; and that a very &s;mall alteration, almo&s;t in any part of it, would effectually have cured her. A lady who has her head &s;urrounded with wires, and her hair &s;tuck full of metal pins, and who at the &s;ame time &s;tands upon dry &s;ilk, is to all intents and purpo&s;es an electrical conductor in&s;olated, and prepared for collec|ting the fire from the atmo&s;phere: And it is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, that during thunder-&s;torms, or when the air is extremely replete with electrical matter, &s;he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mit &s;parks, and exhibit other appearances of electricity.&mdash;I imagine a very trifling change of dre&s;s, which from the con&s;tant ver&s;atility of their modes may &s;ome day take place, would render this lady's di&s;ea&s;e alto|gether epidemical among&s;t the &s;ex. Only let the &s;oles of their &s;hoes be made of an electric &s;ub&s;tance, and let the wires of their caps, and pins of their hair, be &s;ome|what lengthened and pointed outward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and I think there is little doubt, that they will often find them&s;elves in an electrified &s;tate: But, indeed, if they only wear &s;ilk or even wor&s;ted &s;tockings, it may &s;ometimes prove &s;ufficient; for I have often in&s;olated electrome|ters as perfectly by placing them on a piece of dry &s;ilk or flannel, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n gla&s;s.</P>
<P>How little do our ladies imagine, when they &s;ur|round their heads with wire, the mo&s;t powerful of all conductors; and at the &s;ame time wear &s;tockings, &s;hoes, and gowns of &s;ilk, one of the mo&s;t powerful re|pellents,
<PB N="122" REF="024150_0132_0FC3C05DB6DEA568">
that they prepare their bodies in the &s;ame manner, and according to the &s;ame principles as elec|tricians prepare their conductors for attracting the fire of lightning! if they cannot be brought to relinqui&s;h their wire caps and their pins, might they not fall up|on &s;ome &s;uch pre&s;ervative as tho&s;e which of late years have been applied to objects of le&s;s con&s;equence?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that every lady &s;hould provide her&s;elf with a &s;mall chain or wire, to be hooked on at plea&s;ure during thunder-&s;torms. This &s;hould pa&s;s from her cap over the thicke&s;t part of her hair, which will prevent the fire from being communicated to her head; and &s;o down to the ground. It is plain this will act in the &s;ame manner as the conductors on the tops of &s;teeples, which from the metal &s;pires that are commonly placed there, analogous to the pins and wires, were &s;o liable to accidents. You may laugh at all this, but I a&s;&s;ure you I never was more &s;erious in my life. A very amiable lady of my acquaintance, Mrs. Douglas, of Kel&s;o, had almo&s;t lo&s;t her life by one of tho&s;e caps mounted on wire. She was &s;tanding at an open window during a thunder-&s;torm: The lightning was attracted by the wire, and the cap was burnt to a&s;hes; happily her hair was in its natural &s;tate, without pow|der, pomatum, or pins; and prevented the fire from being conducted to her head; for as &s;he felt no kind of &s;hock, it is probable that it went off from the wires of the cap to the wall, clo&s;e to which &s;he then &s;tood. If it had found any conductor to carry it to her head or body, in all probability &s;he mu&s;t have been killed.&mdash;A good &s;trong head of hair, if it is kept perfectly clean and dry is probably one of the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the fire of lightning. But &s;o &s;oon as it is &s;tuffed full of powder and pomatum, and bound together with pins,
<PB N="123" REF="024150_0133_0FC3C05F3480D390">
its repellent force is lo&s;t, and it becomes a conductor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the writing of the&s;e letters, the author has made &s;ome experiments on the electricity of hair; which tend &s;till to convince him the more of what he has advan|ced. A lady had told him, that on combing her hair in fro&s;ty weather, in the dark &s;he had &s;ometimes ob&s;erved &s;parks of fire to i&s;&s;ue from it. This made him think of attempting to collect the electrical fire from hair alone, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other electrical apparatus. To this end, he de&s;ired a young lady to &s;tand on a cake of bees-wax, and to comb her &s;i&s;ter's hair, who was &s;itting on a chair before her. Soon after &s;he began to comb, the young lady on the wax was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed to find her whole body electrified; darting out &s;parks of fire again&s;t every object that approached her. The hair was extremely electrical, and affected an electrometer at a very great di&s;tance: He charged a metal conductor from it with great ca&s;e; and in the &s;pace of a few min|utes collected as much fire immediately from the hair, or to kindle common &s;pirits; and by means of a &s;mall phial gave many &s;mart &s;hocks to all the company. A full ac|count of the&s;e experiments was lately read before the Royal Society. They were made during the time of a very hard fro&s;t and on a &s;trong head of hair, where no powder or pomatum had been u&s;ed for many months.</NOTE> But I beg pardon for the&s;e &s;urmi&s;es: I throw them in your way only for you to improve upon at your lei&s;ure: For we have it ever in our power to be making experi|ments in electricity: And although this fluid is the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and active of any we know, we can command it on all occa&s;ions; and I am now &s;o accu&s;tomed to its operations, that I &s;eldom comb my hair, or pull off a &s;tocking, without ob&s;erving them under &s;ome form or other. How &s;urpri&s;ing is it then, that mankind &s;hould have lived and breathed in it for &s;o many thou&s;and

years, without almo&s;t ever &s;uppo&s;ing that it exi&s;ted! but to return to our mountain.</P>
<P>Recupero told me he had ob&s;erved the &s;ame phae|nomenon here that is common in the eruptions of mount Ve&s;uvius, viz. red forked lightning darting from the &s;moke, without being followed by noi&s;e of thunder. The rea&s;on po&s;&s;ibly is, that the crater and &s;moke is at that time &s;o highly electrical, that, like a cylinder or globe, heated by friction, it throws off &s;pontaneous fla&s;hes into the air, without being brought into the attraction of any conductor, or body le&s;s elec|tric than it&s;elf; (indeed the &s;pontaneous di&s;charges from a good electrical globe, often bear a perfect re|&s;emblance to this kind of lightning:) however, if a non-electric cloud were to pa&s;s near the crater at that time, the cra&s;h of thunder would probably be very violent, which indeed is often the ca&s;e when the air is full of wet clouds in the time of an eruption; but when this does not happen, the equilibrium is probably re&s;tored by degrees, and without any &s;hock, from the &s;urplus of electrical matter being gradually communi|cated to the earth and &s;ea all around the mountain; the immen&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avas that have run from it, &s;erving as conductors.</P>
<P>So highly electric is the vapour of volcanos, that it has been ob&s;erved in &s;ome eruptions both of Aetna and Ve&s;uvius, that the whole tract of &s;moke, which &s;ome|times extended above 100 miles, produced the mo&s;t dreadful effects; killing &s;hepherds and flocks on the mountains; bla&s;ting trees, and &s;etting fire to hou&s;es; wherever it met with them on an elevated &s;ituation. Now probably the flying of a kite, with a wire round its &s;tring, would &s;oon have di&s;armed this formidable cloud. The&s;e effects, however, only happen when
<PB N="125" REF="024150_0135_0FC3C06215FA05B8">
the air is dry and little agitated, but when it is full of moi&s;t vapour, the great rarefaction from the heat of the lava generally brings it down in violent torrents of rain, which &s;oon convey the electrical matter from the clouds to the earth, and re&s;tores the equilibrium.</P>
<P>As Recupero, who is a facetious and an agreeable companion was kind enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it a good deal with me during my confinement, I have gathered many remarks from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> conver&s;ation, that may perhaps be worthy of your attention.</P>
<P>The variety of waters about Aetna, he tells me, is &s;urpri&s;ing. I have already mentioned the Flume Freddo, or the river of Acis: Recupero confirms what I had been told of it. There is a lake on the north of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, of about three miles in circumference, which receives &s;everal con&s;iderable rivers; yet, altho' there is no apparent outlet, it never overflows its banks. I &s;ugge&s;ted the probability of a &s;ubter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aneous communication betwixt this and the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ume Freddo. He &s;aid there was no re&s;emblance in the quality of their waters; however, I think it is probable that in a cour&s;e of &s;o many miles, through the caverns of Aetna, full of &s;alts and minerals, it may acquire both its cold and its vitriolic qualities.</P>
<P>There is another lake on the top of a mountain to the we&s;t of Aetna, the bottom of which could never be found. It is ob&s;erved never either to ri&s;e or fall, but always to pre&s;erve the &s;ame level. It is undoubted|ly the crater of that mountain (which is all of burnt matter) converted into a lake. The river which &s;up|plies the baths of Catania is of a very different nature: It never continues the &s;ame, but is perpetually chang|ing. Its current is for the mo&s;t part confined under
<PB N="126" REF="024150_0136_0FC3C063B3624FE8">
ground by the lavas; but &s;ometimes it bur&s;ts out with &s;uch violence that the city has &s;uffered greatly from it; and what is &s;till more unfortunate, the&s;e eruptions are generally followed by &s;ome epidemical di&s;temper. It has now been con&s;tantly dimini&s;hing for the&s;e two years pa&s;t, and is at pre&s;ent almo&s;t reduced to nothing. They are in perpetual dread of its breaking out, and laying wa&s;te their fields, as it has &s;o often done before. What is &s;ingular, it generally bur&s;ts out after a long tract of the drie&s;t and warme&s;t weather. The Aetnean academy have never been able to account for this circum|&s;tance think it is mo&s;t probable, that it ari&s;es from the melting of the &s;now on Aetna, but I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay how. The&s;e, perhaps, overfilling the caverns that u&s;ually receive their water, the &s;urplus is carried off into this river.</P>
<P>The river of Alcantara certainly takes its ri&s;e from the melting of the&s;e &s;nows. Its waters, I ob&s;erved, are of the &s;ame whiti&s;h colour as all the rivers are, that run from the Glacieres among&s;t the Alps. There are &s;everal periodical &s;prings on Aetna, that flow only during the day, and &s;top during the night. The&s;e are naturally and ea&s;ily accounted for from the melting of the &s;now; for it melts only during the day, being hard frozen every night, even in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on. There are likewi&s;e a variety of poi&s;onous &s;prings, &s;ome of &s;o deadly a quality, that birds and bea&s;ts have been found lying dead on their banks, from having drunk of their water. But (what is perhaps &s;till more &s;ingular) Re|cupero told me, that about twenty years ago, a rent opened in the mountain, that for a con&s;iderable time &s;ent forth &s;o mephitic a vapour, that like the Avernus, birds were &s;uffocated in flying over it.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="024150_0137_0FC3C065324D5990">There are many caverns where the air is &s;o ex|tremely cold, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport it for any time. The&s;e the pea&s;ants make u&s;e of as re&s;ervoirs for the &s;now; and indeed they make the fine&s;t ice-hou&s;es in the world, pre&s;erving it hard frozen during the hotte&s;t &s;ummers. It would be endle&s;s to give an account of all the caverns, and other curious appear|ances about Aetna. Kircher &s;peaks of a cave which he &s;aw, capable, he &s;ays, of containing 30,000 men. Here, he adds, numbers of people have been lo&s;t from their temerity in going too far. One of the&s;e caverns &s;till retains the name of Pro&s;erpine, from its being &s;uppo&s;ed by the ancients, the pa&s;&s;age by which Pluto conveyed her into his dominions; on this occa&s;ion Ovid de&s;cribes Ceres, as &s;earching for the daughter, with two trees which &s;he had plucked from the mountain, and lighted by way of torches. The&s;e he calls Teda, which is &s;till the name of a tree, I have &s;een no where but on mount Aetna. It produces a great quantity of ro&s;in, and was &s;urely the mo&s;t proper tree Ceres could have pitched upon for her purpo&s;e.

<P>I have mentioned the great variety of flowers, trees, &amp;c. on mount Aetna. I have found a long li&s;t of them in Ma&s;&s;a; but as I am not acquainted with their Si|cilian names, I can make little out of it. I have enga|ged a per&s;on here to procure me a collection of their &s;eeds in the &s;ea&s;on. I find of the number, the cinna|mon, &s;ar&s;aparilla, &s;a&s;&s;afras, rhubarb, and many others that I thought had not been natives of Europe. The Palma Chri&s;ti too, that plant &s;o much celebrated of la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, from the &s;eed of which the ca&s;tor-oil is made, grows both here and in many other places of Sicily, in the greate&s;t abundance.

You may believe we &s;hall not leave Sicily without providing our&s;elves with a quantity of this precious &s;eed.</P>
<P>Mount Aetna, I find, is as much celebrated by the ancients as the moderns, for the variety of its odor fer|ous productions. Plutarch &s;ays, their &s;mell was &s;o &s;trong, that on many places of the mountain it was impo&s;&s;ible to hunt. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the pa&s;&s;age as it is before me in an old tran&s;lation I have borrowed: <Q>Circum Aetnam in Sicilia nemin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n ferunt cum cani|bus venatum iri; quia enim multos perpetuo illic ut in viridario prata&punc; colle&s;que flores mittunt a fragran|tia, q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae eam oram occupat, obfu&s;care ferarum anhelationes,</Q> &amp;c.

<P>There were formerly a variety of wild bea&s;ts in the woody regions of Aetna; but notwith&s;tanding this advantage they had over the dogs and hunters, the number of the&s;e is now greatly reduced. They have &s;till however the wild boar, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oebuck, and a kind of wild goat; but the race of &s;tags, which was much celebrated, as well as that of bears, is thought to be extinct. Several places of the mountain are &s;till named from tho&s;e animals.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es and cattle of mount Aetna were e&s;teemed the be&s;t in Sicily. The cattle are &s;till of a large &s;ize, and have horns of &s;uch a length, that they are pre&s;erved as curio&s;ities in &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;eum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P><PB N="129" REF="024150_0139_0FC3C071EC302240">There are &s;aid to be quantities of porcupines and land tortoi&s;es on &s;ome parts of Aetna, but we had not the good fortune to meet with any of them. Neither did we fee any eagles or vultures, which are likewi&s;e &s;aid to be inhabitants of this mountain.</P>
<P>The accounts given of mount Aetna by the old Sicilian authors (&s;everal of whom I have borrowed from Recupero) are very various. Some of them de&s;cribe the hollow of the crater at being &s;even or eight miles in circumference, &s;ome make it fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and others only three. And probably all of them are right; far I find, by all their accounts that generally once in about 100 years, the whole crater has fallen down into the bowels of the mountain: That in proce&s;s of time, a now crater is &s;een peeping out of the gulph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which, perpetually increa&s;ing by the matter thrown up, is by degrees rai&s;ed again to its ancient height, '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill at last becoming too heavy for its hollow foundations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again gives way, and at once &s;inks down into the mountain. This happened about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00 years ago, in the year 1669, as recorded by Borelli, who&s;e account of it I have before me. <Q>Univer&s;um cacumen, quod ad in&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;peculae, &s;eu tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ris, ad ingentem altitud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nem elevaba|tur, quod una cum va&s;ta planitie areno&s;a depre&s;&s;a, atque ab&s;orpta e&s;t in profundum vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ginem,</Q> &amp;c. The &s;ame likewi&s;e happened in the year 1536, as recorded by Fazzello and Filotoo; and in the years 1444, 1329, and 1157. Of all the&s;e I have read an account; but probably betwixt the two la&s;t mentioned, there has been another, that is not recorded, as the intervals betwixt all the re&s;t are pretty nearly equal.</P>
<P>Some of them give a dreadful account of it. Fol|cando, one of their hi&s;torians, tells us, it &s;hook the whole i&s;land, and re&s;ounded through all its &s;hores.
<PB N="130" REF="024150_0140_0FC3C07D630A7198">
And their poet Errico &s;ays, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion:
<Q><L><HI>"S'ode il &s;uo gran mugito</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Per mille piagge e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i."</HI></L>
<L>"The bellowing dire a thou&s;and lands re&s;ound,</L>
<L>"Who&s;e trembling &s;hores return the dreadful &s;ound."</L></Q>
In all probability, this event will very &s;oon happen, as the circumference of the crater is no where recorded to have been reduced to le&s;s than three miles; and Recu|pero &s;ays, it is at pre&s;ent only three miles and a half; be&s;ides, 100 years, the common period, has now elap&s;|ed &s;ince its la&s;t fall.</P>
<P>There are many &s;tories of people peri&s;hing by their temerity, in being too curious &s;pectators of the erup|tions of this mountain; but there are &s;till many more, of tho&s;e that have been miraculou&s;ly &s;aved by the inter|position of &s;ome &s;aint or the virgin, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a perpetual &s;tate of warfare with the devils in mount Aetna. That part of the i&s;land where Aetna &s;tands, has ever been named <HI>il Val Demoni,</HI> from the frequent apparitions of the&s;e devils. It makes one third of the i&s;land. The other two are named the <HI>Val di Not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and the <HI>Val di Mazzara.</HI></P>
<P>There is one &s;tory, though a very old one, that is &s;till related at Catania; it is taken notice of by Seneca, Ari&s;totle, Strabo, and others. In the time of a great eruption, when the fire was pouring down upon the city, and every one was carrying off his mo&s;t valuable effects; two rich brothers, named <HI>Anfinomus</HI> and <HI>Ana|pias,</HI> neglecting all their wealth, e&s;caped from the conflagration with their aged parents on their backs. The&s;e authors add, that the fire, re&s;pecting &s;uch filial
<PB N="131" REF="024150_0141_0FC3C07F8A2F9EC8">
piety, &s;pared them, whil&s;t many others that took the &s;ame road were con&s;umed.</P>
<P>This action has been wonderfully extolled, and proves, I think, that &s;eats of this kind were by no means common in tho&s;e days.&mdash;Now, pray, don't you think, in the world at pre&s;ent, bad as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, there are few &s;ons, who would not have acted in the &s;ame manner? And &s;ure I am, the re&s;t of man|kind would not have made &s;uch a fu&s;s about it. Hu|manity and natural affection, I believe, in tho&s;e ages we are inclined to extol &s;o much, were not by many de|grees &s;o powerful as they are at pre&s;ent. Even the pious Aeneas him&s;elf, one of the mo&s;t renowned of all their heroes, was in effect but a &s;avage, notwith&s;tand|ing all that Virgil &s;ays to per&s;uade us of the contrary; for you find him &s;acrificing his weak and captive ene|mies, at the &s;ame time that he is canting and preaching up piety and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e two brothers were &s;o celebrated for this ac|tion, that there was a di&s;pute betwixt Syracu&s;e and Catania, which of the&s;e cities had given them birth; and temples were erected in both of them, dedicated to Filial Piety, in memory of the event.</P>
<P>In the accounts of the more recent de&s;tructions of Catania, there occurs no in&s;tance of this &s;ort. We find them only lamenting the lo&s;s of prie&s;ts and nuns, and very much out of humour at their &s;aints, for allow|ing the devils to get the better of them. I have been a good deal entertained with &s;ome of tho&s;e authors. Selvaggio, one of their poets, &s;peaking of the terrible earthquake in the year 1169, that de&s;troyed Catania, and buried multitudes of people in the ruins, de&s;cribes it in the following manner, which may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the poetry of that time:

But another, Gu&s;tanavilla, one of their hi&s;torians, gives a very different account of this affair; as it is likewi&s;e &s;omewhat curious in its way, I &s;hall copy it for your amu&s;ement: <Q>In omnem terram, et in fines orbis t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrae jam exiit plaga illa, qua nuper in Sicilia percu&s;&s;i &s;unt Catanen&s;es in vigilia B.

<P>He adds, that if St. Agatha's veil had not been pro|duced, the angel of the Lord was in &s;uch a fury, that he would not have left one &s;oul alive.</P>
<P>There is a curious painting of the great eruption in 1669, in the cathedral of this place. It is but indiffer|ently painted, but gives a dreadful idea of that event. Borrelli, who was upon the &s;pot, de&s;cribes it.&mdash;He

&s;ays, on the 11th of March, &s;ometime before the lava bur&s;t out, after violent earthquakes and dreadful &s;ub|terraneous bellowing, a rent was opened in the moun|tain twelve miles long: in &s;ome places of which, when they threw down &s;tones, they could not hear them &s;trike the bottom.

<P>He &s;ays, this deluge of fire, after de&s;troying the fine&s;t country in Sicily, and &s;weeping away churches, villages, and convents, broke over the lofty walls of Catania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and covered up five of its ba&s;tions with the intervening curtains. From thence pouring down on the city, it de&s;troyed every object it met with, overwhelming and burying all in one promi&s;euous ruin.</P>
<P>What he regrets mo&s;t, was &s;ome precious remains of antiquity; the names, the &s;ituation, and even the memory of who&s;e exi&s;tence, is now lo&s;t in the place. He mentions an amphitheatre, which he calls <HI>Golli&s;eo,</HI>

the <HI>Circus Maximus,</HI> the <HI>Naumachia,</HI> and &s;everal temples.</P>
<P>An account of this great eruption was &s;ent to Charles II. by Lord Winchel&s;ea, who was then returning from his emba&s;&s;y at Con&s;tantinople, and &s;topped here on purpo&s;e to &s;ee &s;o remarkable an event. But his lord|&s;hip has not been at that pains to examine it as we could have wi&s;hed. His curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied in one day; and he &s;eems to have been contented only to look at the lava at a great di&s;tance; but did not think of examining its &s;ource, or a&s;cending the mountain, altho' at that time all the mo&s;t formidable circum&s;tances of the eruption were already over.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not fini&s;h this account of mount Aetna, without &s;aying &s;omething of the various fables and allegories to which it has given ri&s;e; but it would probably lead me into too va&s;t a field, and give this more the air of a di&s;&s;ertation than a letter or a journal. The&s;e you will ea&s;ily recollect: They have afforded ample employment for the mu&s;e, in all ages, and in all languages; and indeed the philo&s;opher and natur|al hi&s;torian, have found, in the real properties of this mountain, as ample a fund of &s;peculation, as the poets have done in the fictitious. It is &s;o often mentioned by the ancient writers, that it has been &s;aid of Aetna, as well as of Greece:
<Q>"Nullum e&s;t &s;ine nomine &s;axum."</Q>
Indeed, I am afraid this &s;aying was much more applica|ble to it formerly than it is at pre&s;ent; for we even found &s;everal large mountains that had no name; and it does not at all appear, that the number of philo&s;o|phers in Sicily have by any means increa&s;ed in the later ages. Their ambition is now changed; and if they
<PB N="135" REF="024150_0145_0FC3C08577AF3020">
can get a &s;aint to keep the devils of Aetna in order, they trouble them&s;elves very little about the cause of its operations, and do not value their i&s;land half &s;o much for having given birth to Archimedes or Empe|docles, as to St. Agatha and St. Ro&s;olia.</P>
<P>The ancients, as well as the moderns, &s;eem ever to have con&s;idered Aetna as one of the highe&s;t moun|tains on the globe. There are many ma&s;&s;ages in their authors that &s;hew this; tho' perhaps, none more &s;trong|ly than their making Deucalion and Pyrrha take refuge on the top of it, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the univer&s;al deluge.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Catacly&s;mus, quod nos diluvium dicimus, cum factus e&s;t, omne genus bumanum interiit praeter Deucalionem et Pyrrham, qui in inontem Aetnam qui alti&s;&s;imus in Sicilia e&s;&s;e dicitur fugerunt, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;hall now concluded this long account of mount Aetna with Virgil's celebrated de&s;cription of it in the third Aeneid, which has been &s;o much admired. You may compare it with the following de&s;cription of the famous poet Raitano, held, I a&s;&s;ure you, in full as high e&s;timation by the Sicilians.</P>

<P>So &s;ings the Sicilian mu&s;e; yon will not however he&s;itate to give the preference to the Roman one; although the former is evidently &s;tolen from her.
<Q><L>"&mdash;Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis,</L>

<P>But both the&s;e have been greatly out-done by the wonderful imagination of our great countryman Sir Richard Blackmore; who accounts at once for the whole phaenomena of Aetna, by the &s;imple idea of giving; the mountain a fit of the colic: A thought that had e&s;caped all the poets and philo&s;ophers of antiquity, and &s;eems for ever to have been re&s;erved for the pro|found genius of this great ma&s;ter and father of the Bathes. I have forgot the pa&s;&s;age; but you will find it, I think, in prince Arthur.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophical poet Lucretius, has likewi&s;e men|tioned the eruptions of mount Aetna; but Pindar is the olde&s;t poet we know of, that has taken any notice of them. His de&s;cription is, I think, the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory of all, and conveys a clearer idea both of the mountain it&s;elf, and an eruption of the mountain, than either the Roman o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sicilian poet, though it is not near &s;o much laboured, nor worked up with all that variety of cir|cum&s;tances, they have found means to introduce. Its greate&s;t fault is, that Pindar had &s;till kept in view that
<PB N="137" REF="024150_0147_0FC3C0885B53F0F0">
ab&s;urd idea of the ancients, that Jupiter had buried the giants under mount Aetna; and that their &s;truggling to get loo&s;e, was the cau&s;e of its eruptions: But even this he touches but &s;lightly, as if a&s;hamed to give &s;uch a rea&s;on. The pa&s;&s;age is tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h by Mr. We&s;t.

<P>This passage decides what has been much di&s;puted, that Aetna, was in the&s;e early ages, of as great an eleva|tion as at pre&s;ent. It has been alledged, that volcanos always increa&s;e in height 'till they are extingui&s;hed, when they are &s;uppo&s;ed to moulder down, and by de|grees &s;ink into the caverns that are below them, like the a&s;truni, and the &s;olfaterra at Naples: However we find that Aetna was at that time as now, covered with eternal &s;nows, and was &s;uppo&s;ed, like Atlas, to be one of the great props of heaven. But what plea&s;es me the mo&s;t in this de&s;cription is, that it proves beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that in the&s;e very remote erup|tions, it was common for the lavas of Aetna to run a great way out to &s;ea. The conclu&s;ion, I think, is ful|ly as ju&s;t, and perhaps not le&s;s &s;ublime, than the "avol|&s;aque vi&s;cera montis erigit eructans" of Virgil, which, I mu&s;t own, I think rather comes too near Sir Rich|ard's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="024150_0148_0FC3C08A051329F0">Thucydides &s;peaks of three eruptions of this moun|tain; but is not &s;o particular as we could have wi&s;hed. He does not mention the date of the fir&s;t; but &s;ays, it was the earlie&s;t after the arrival of the Greeks in Sicily. The &s;econd happened about the time of the 77th Olympiad, and the la&s;t in that of the 88th, which was nearly about the period when Pindar wrote; &s;o that we cannot doubt that his de&s;cription is taken from the ac|counts he had heard of &s;ome of tho&s;e eruptions, the circum&s;tances of which, no doubt, at that time, had afforded matter of conver&s;ation all over Greece.</P>

<P>ON the 31&s;t of May we embarked on board a felucca, and &s;et &s;ail for the mighty Syracu&s;e. The wind was favourable, and for &s;ome time we went at a great rate. The view of mount Aetna, for the whole of this little voyage, is wonderfully fine, and the bold black coa&s;t formed for near thirty miles, of the lava of that immen&s;e volcano, gives the mo&s;t awful idea of its eruptions. There is no part of this coa&s;t nearer than
<PB N="139" REF="024150_0149_0FC3C08BC82F13D8">thirty miles to its &s;ummit; and yet there has hardly been any great eruption, where the lava has not reach|ed the &s;ea, and driven back its waters to a great di&s;tance, leaving high rocks and promontories, that for ever &s;et its waves at defiance, and pre&s;cribe their utmo&s;t limits. What a tremendous &s;cene must the meeting betwixt the&s;e adver&s;e elements have formed!</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily conceive the variety of changes this coa&s;t has undergone in the &s;pace of &s;ome thou&s;ands of years, as every great eruption must have made a con|&s;iderable difference. Virgil is wonderfully minute and exact in his geography of Sicily; and this is the only part of the i&s;land that &s;eems to be materially altered &s;ince his time. He &s;ays there was a very large port at the foot of Aetna, were &s;hips were &s;ecure from every wind;
<Q>"Portus ab acce&s;&s;u ventorum immotus et ingens;"</Q>
of which, at pre&s;ent, there are not the lea&s;t remains. It is probably the &s;ame that was called by the Sicilians the port of Uly&s;&s;es; which is often mentioned by their writers. The place of its exi&s;tence is &s;till &s;hewn betwixt three and four miles up the country, among&s;t the lavas of Aetna. However, I can &s;ee no &s;ort of rea&s;on why they have called this the port of Uly&s;&s;es: For &s;urely Homer does not bring his hero near the precincts of mount Aetna. Indeed I think it is evident, that this volcano did not burn during the time of Ho|mer, nor for &s;ome ages preceeding it, otherwi&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible, that he would have &s;aid &s;o much of Sicily, without taking any notice of &s;o great and capital an object, which, of all others, the daring and &s;ublime imagination of Homer would have been the mo&s;t eager to gra&s;p at. It is evident, from his account, that Uly&s;|&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at the we&s;t end of Sicily, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;land
<PB N="140" REF="024150_0150_0FC3C08CF1933920">
of Lachaea, now Favignana, almo&s;t two hundred miles di&s;tant from this port.</P>
<P>Virgil, with more judgment, lands his hero at the foot of Aetna, which gives him an opportunity of in|troducing &s;ome of the fine&s;t de&s;criptions in the Aeneid. But it is &s;omewhat odd, that here he makes Aeneas find one of Uly&s;&s;es's companions, who had e&s;caped the rage of Polyphemus, and had lived for &s;everal months in the woods and caverns of this mountain. Virgil mu&s;t have been aware of this impropriety, as he well knew that Homer had landed Uly&s;&s;es, and placed the cave of Polyphemus at the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of the i&s;land. But he could not prevail on him&s;elf to pa&s;s mount Aetna. He was &s;o thoroughly convinced, that this was the mo&s;t proper landing-place for an epic hero, as well as the mo&s;t proper habitation for the Cyclops, that, by a bold poetical licence, he has fairly taken it for granted, that Homer really made it &s;o. Indeed, in this pa&s;&s;age, the plea&s;ure he affords to the imagination of his reader, makes an ample amends for his having impo|&s;ed on his judgment. But to return to our voyage.</P>
<P>The view of the mountain from the &s;ea is more complete and &s;atisfactory than any where on the i&s;land.

The different regions of the mountain are di&s;tinctly marked out, by their different colours, and different productions; expo&s;ing at once to the ravi&s;hed eye every climate, and every &s;ea&s;on, with all their variety;

<P>The circumference of the great ba&s;e of Aetna, Re|cupero told me, he had been at a good deal of pains to a&s;certain; as it had generally been computed only at a hundred miles, or little more, although the radii of that circle had ever been e&s;teemed at thirty of tho&s;e miles; an ab&s;urdity in computation that had put him upon making this inquiry. The re&s;ult was, that taking the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tances of one place from anoth|er, all the way round, the &s;um of the whole amount|ed to one hundred and eighty three miles: An immen&s;e circle &s;urely, and which is &s;till enlarged by every con|&s;iderable eruption. The whole of this circle is form|ed of lava and burnt matter; and I have ob&s;erved, that near the very outermo&s;t borders of it, there have been many little eruptions that have pierced through &s;ome of the thicke&s;t lavas of Aetna. The&s;e &s;mall eruptions, at &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance from the great furnace of the mountain, are probably occa&s;ioned by the inten&s;e heat of the lava, which continues for many years rarefying the air, in the caverns it has run over, which bur&s;ting forth from its pri&s;on, the lava &s;inks down, and kindling the &s;ulphur and nitre with which the&s;e caverns are fill|ed, exhibits in miniature the phaenomena of a great eruption.</P>
<P>There is a large &s;andy beach that extends from the mouth of the river Simetus, a great way to the &s;outh
<PB N="142" REF="024150_0152_0FC3C08FE77856F0">
of Catania, and was probably continued the whole way to the foot of the mountain of Taurominum, (where there are &s;till &s;ome remains of the ea&s;t end of it) 'till it was broken in upon many thou&s;and years ago by the lavas of Aetna; which, from a flat &s;andy &s;hore, have now converted it into a high, bold, black iron coa&s;t. What is a &s;trong proof of this, in many places where they have &s;unk deep wells, after piercing through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e lava, they have at la&s;t come to beds of &s;hells, and &s;ea &s;and.</P>
<P>There is nothing el&s;e very intere&s;ting in the voyage from Catania to Syracu&s;e. If you will read the con|clu&s;ion of the third book of the Aeneid, you will find a much better de&s;cription of it than any I can give you. The coa&s;t lies low, and, except Aetna, there are no very &s;triking objects.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the mouths of several rivers: The fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the Giarretta, or river of St. Paul, formerly the Simetus; and under that name celebrated by the poets. The nymph, Thalia, after her amour with Jupiter, is &s;upposed to have been changed into this &s;tream; and, to avoid the re&s;entment of Juno, &s;unk under ground near mount Aetna, and continued her &s;ubterraneous cour&s;e to the &s;ea. This river was navigable in the time of the Romans, and Ma&s;&s;a &s;ays, the only one in the i&s;land that was &s;o. It takes its ri&s;e on the north &s;ide of Aetna, and &s;urrounding the we&s;t &s;kirts of the mountain, falls into the &s;ea near the ruins of the ancient Morgantio. It no longer &s;inks under ground as it did formerly; but it is now celebrated for a quality it does not appear to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the times of antiquity, as none of the old writers take notice of it. It throws up near its mouth great quantities of fine amber: This is carefully
<PB N="143" REF="024150_0153_0FC3C091A23C2518">
gathered by the pea&s;ants in the neighbourhood, and brought to Catania, where it is manufactured into the form of cro&s;&s;es, beads, &s;aints, &amp;c. and is &s;old at high prices to the &s;uper&s;titious people on the continent. We bought &s;everal of the&s;e re&s;pectable figures, and found them electrical in a high degree, powerfully attracting feathers, &s;traws, and other light bodies; &s;omewhat emblematical, you will &s;ay, of what they repre&s;ent. Some pieces of this amber contain flies and other in&s;ects curiou&s;ly pre&s;erved in its &s;ub&s;tance; and we were not a little entertained with the ingenuity of one of the arti&s;ts, who has left a large blue-bottle fly, with its wings expanded, exactly over the head of a &s;aint, to repre&s;ent, he told us, <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirito &s;anto</HI> de&s;cending upon him. I have got &s;ome fine pieces of this amber, more electric, I think, and emitting a &s;tronger &s;mell, than that which comes from the Baltic. The genera|tion of this &s;ub&s;tance has long been a controverted point among&s;t naturali&s;ts; nor do I believe it is as yet a&s;certained, whether it is a &s;ea or a land production. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a kind of gum or bitumen, that i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ues from the earth in a liquid &s;tate, at which time the flies and other in&s;ects that light upon it are caught, and by their &s;truggles to get loo&s;e, &s;oon work them&s;elves into its &s;ub&s;tance, which hardening round them, they are for ever pre&s;erved in the greate&s;t per|fection. Large fine pieces are con&s;tantly found at the mouth of the Simetus, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought down by the river; but it is &s;ingular, that none of it is ever found any where but on the &s;ea-&s;hore: They have likewi&s;e here a kind of artificial amber, made I am told, from copal; but it is very different from the natural.</P>
<P>Not far from the mouth of this river there are two of the large&s;t lakes in Sicily; the Beviere, and the
<PB N="144" REF="024150_0154_0FC3C093122FB748">
Pantana; the fir&s;t of which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made by Hercules; in con&s;equence of which it was held &s;acred by the ancients. They are full of a vari|ety of fi&s;h; one &s;pecies of which, called Molletti, is much e&s;teemed: The &s;alting and exportation of the&s;e makes a con&s;iderable branch of commerce at Leontini, which is in that neighbourhood: That city is one of the mo&s;t antient in the i&s;land, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the habitation of the Le&s;trigons.</P>
<P>The Leontine fields have been much famed for their fertility: Both Diodorus and Pliny a&s;&s;ert that they yielded wheat an hundred-fold, and that grain grew &s;pontaneou&s;ly here without culture: But this was only during the reign of Ceres, and is not now the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In a few hours &s;ailing we came in &s;ight of the city of Augu&s;ta, which is beautifully &s;ituated in a &s;mall i&s;land that was formerly a penin&s;ula: It was therefore called by the Greeks Cher&s;one&s;us. Both the city and forti|fications &s;eem con&s;iderable, and are &s;aid to contain about 9000 inhabitants. The ruins of the Little Hybla, &s;o celebrated for its honey, lie within a few miles of this place.</P>
<P>Some time before our arrival at Syracu&s;e, it fell a dead calm, and we &s;pied a fine turtle fa&s;t a&s;leep on the &s;urface of the water. Our pilot ordered a profound &s;ilence, and only two oars to row very gently, that if po&s;&s;ible we might &s;urpri&s;e him. Every thing was put in order, and two men were placed ready at the prow to &s;ecure the prize. We were all attention and ex|pectation, and dur&s;t hardly breathe for fear of di&s;turb|ing him.</P>
<P>We moved &s;lowly on, and the turtle lay &s;tone-&s;till;
<PB N="145" REF="024150_0155_0FC3C094818B3BB0">
the two men bent down their bodies, and had their arms already in the water to &s;eize him. No alderman, with all deference be it &s;poken, ever beheld his turtle with more plea&s;ure and &s;ecurity; nor fea&s;ted his imagination more lu&s;ciou&s;ly upon the banquet.&mdash;He was already our own in idea, and we were only thinking of the various ways in which he &s;hould be dre&s;&s;ed: When, how vain and tran&s;itory all human po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions! the turtle made a plunge, &s;lipped through their fingers, and di&s;appeared in a moment, and with him all our hopes. We looked very fooli&s;h at each other, without uttering a word, 'till Fullarton a&s;ked me in the mo&s;t provoking manner in the world, whether I would chu&s;e a little of the callipa&s;h or the callipee. The two men &s;hrugged up their &s;houlders, and &s;aid <HI>Pazienza;</HI> but Glover told them in a rage, that all the pazienza on earth was not equal to a good turtle.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the remains of the great Syracu&s;e appeared; the remembrance of who&s;e glory, magnifi|cence, and illu&s;trious deeds both in arts and arms, made us for &s;ome time even forget our turtle. But, alas! how are the mighty fallen! this proud city, that vied with Rome it&s;elf, is now reduced to a heap of rubbi&s;h; for what remains of it de&s;erves not the name of a city. We rowed round the greate&s;t part of its walls without &s;eeing a human creature; tho&s;e very walls that were the terror of the Roman arms; from whence Archimedos battered their fleets, and with his engines lifted their ve&s;&s;els out of the &s;ea, and da&s;hed them again&s;t the rocks. We found the interior part of the city agreed but too well with its external appearance. There was not an inn to be found; and after vi&s;iting all the mona&s;teries and religious fraterni|ties in &s;earch of beds, we found the whole of them &s;o wretchedly mean dirty, that we preferred at la&s;t to
<PB N="146" REF="024150_0156_0FC3C09CC0E7C020">
&s;leep on &s;traw; but even that we could not have clean, but are eat up with vermin of every kind.</P>
<P>We had letters for the Count Gaetano, who made an apology that he could not lodge us, but in other re&s;pects &s;hewed us many civilities; particularly in giv|ing us the u&s;e of his carriage, in explaining the ruins, in pointing out every thing that was worthy of our attention; and likewi&s;e in giving us letters of recom|mendation for Malta. He is a gentleman of good &s;en&s;e, and has written &s;everal treati&s;es on the antiquities of Sicily.</P>
<P>Of the four cities that compo&s;ed the ancient Syracu&s;e, there remains only Ortigia, by much the &s;malle&s;t, &s;ituated in the i&s;land of that name. It is about two miles round, and &s;uppo&s;ed to contain about 14,000 inhabitants. The ruins of the other three, Tycha, Acradina, and Neapoli, are computed at twenty-two miles in circumference, but almo&s;t the whole of this &s;pace is now converted into rich vineyards, orchards, and corn-fields; the walls of the&s;e are indeed every where built with broken marbles full of engravings and in&s;criptions, but mo&s;t of them defaced and &s;poiled. The principal remains of antiquity are a theatre and amphitheatre; many &s;epulchres, the Latomie, the Cat|acombs, and the famous ear of Diony&s;ius, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy. The Latomie now makes a noble &s;ubterraneous garden, and is indeed one of the mo&s;t beautiful and romantic &s;pots I ever beheld. Mo&s;t of it is about one hundred feet below the level of the earth, and of an incredible extent. The whole is hewn out of a rock as hard as marble, compo&s;ed of a concretion of &s;hells, gravel, and other marine bodies. The bottom of this immen&s;e quarry, from whence probably the greate&s;t part of Syracu&s;e was built, is now
<PB N="147" REF="024150_0157_0FC3C09E446F5488">
covered with an exceeding rich &s;oil; and as no wind from any point of the compa&s;s can touch it, it is filled with a great variety of the fine&s;t &s;hrubs and fruit-trees, which bear with va&s;t luxuriance, and are never bla&s;ted. The oranges, citrons, bergamots, pomegranates, figs, &amp;c. are all of a remarkable &s;ize and fine quality. Some of the&s;e trees, but more particularly the olives, grow out of the hard rock; where there is no vi&s;ible &s;oil; and exhibit a very uncommon and plea&s;ing appearance.</P>
<P>There is a variety of wild and romantic &s;cenes in this curious garden; in the mid&s;t of which we were &s;urpri&s;ed by the appearance of a figure under one of the caverns, that added greatly to the dignity and &s;olemni|ty of the place.&mdash;It was that of an aged man, with a long flowing white beard that reached down to his middle. His old wrinkled face and &s;canty grey locks pronounced him a member of &s;ome former age as well as of this. His hands, which were &s;hook by the pal&s;y, held a &s;ort of pilgrim's &s;taff; and about his neck there was a &s;tring of large beads with a crucifix hanging to its end. Had it not been for the&s;e marks of his later exi&s;tence, I don't know but I &s;hould have a&s;ked him, whether in his youth, he had not been acquainted with Theocritus and Archimedes, and if he did not remem|ber the reign of Diony&s;ius the tyrant. But he &s;aved us the trouble, by telling us he was the hermit of the place, and belonged to a convent of Capuchins on the rock above; that he had now bid adieu to the upper world, and was determined to &s;pend the re&s;t of his life in this &s;olitude, in prayer for the wretched mortals that inhabit it.</P>
<P>This figure, together with the &s;cene in which it appears, are indeed admirably well adapted, and reflect
<PB N="148" REF="024150_0158_0FC3C09FA7E954B8">
a mutual dignity upon each other. We left &s;ome money upon the rock: For the Capuchins, who are the greate&s;t beggars on earth, never touch money, but &s;ave their too tender con&s;ciences, and pre&s;erve their vows unbroken, by the &s;imple device of lifting it with a pair of pincers, and carrying it to market in their &s;ack or cowl. This I have &s;een more than once. We were much delighted with the Latomie, and left it with regret: It is the very &s;ame that has been &s;o much cel|ebrated by Cicero about 1800 years ago; <Q>Opus e&s;t ingens (&s;ays he) magnificum regum, ac tyrannorum, Totum ex &s;axo in mirandam altitudinem depre&s;&s;o,</Q> &amp;c. A little to the we&s;t of it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood the country-hou&s;e, the &s;ale of which you will remem|ber he gives &s;o lively and plea&s;ant an account of; by which a gold&s;mith (I have forgot his name) cheated a Roman nobleman in a very ingenious manner.</P>
<P>The ear of Diony&s;ius is no le&s;s a monument of the ingenuity and magnificence, than of the cruelty of that tyrant. It is a huge cavern cut out of the hard rock; in the form of the human ear. The perpendicular height of it is about 80 feet, and the length of this enor|mous ear is not le&s;s than 250. The cavern was &s;aid to be &s;o contrived, that every &s;ound made in it, was collected and united into one point, as into a focus; this was called the Tympanum; and exactly oppo&s;ite to it the tyrant had made a &s;mall hole, which commu|nicated with a little apartment where he u&s;ed to conceal him&s;elf. He applied his own ear to this hole, and is &s;aid to have heard di&s;tinctly every word that was &s;poken in the cavern below. This apartment was no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, and a proof of it made, than he put to death all the workmen that had been employed in it. He then confined in it all that he &s;u&s;pected were his enemies; and by over-hearing their conver&s;ation, judged of their
<PB N="149" REF="024150_0159_0FC3C0A3045F6668">
guilt, and condemned and acquitted accordingly.</P>
<P>As this chamber of Diony&s;ius is very high in the rock, and now totally inacce&s;&s;ible, we had it not in our power to make proof of this curious experiment, which our guides told us had been done &s;ome years ago by the captain of an Engli&s;h &s;hip.</P>
<P>The echo in the ear is prodigious; much &s;uperior to any other cavern I have &s;een. The hole in the rock, to which the pri&s;oners were chained, &s;till remain, and even the lead and iron in &s;everal of them. We &s;urpri|&s;ed a poor young porcupine who had come here to drink, of whom our guides made lawful prize. Near to this there are caverns of a great extent, where they carry on a manufactory of nine, which is found in va&s;t abundance on the &s;ides of the&s;e; caves.</P>
<P>The amphitheatre is in the form of a very eccentric ellip&s;e, and is much ruined; but the theatre is &s;o entire, that mo&s;t of the gradini or &s;eats &s;till remain. Both the&s;e are in that part of the city that was called Nea|poli, or the New City. <Q>Quarta autem e&s;t urbs (&s;ays Cicero) quae quia po&s;trema aedificata e&s;t, Nea|polis nominatur, quam ad &s;ummam theatrum e&s;t maximum,</Q> &amp;c. However, it is but a &s;mall theatre in compari&s;on of that Taurominum. We &s;earched among&s;t the &s;epulchres, &s;everal of which are very ele|gant, for that of Archimedes; but could &s;ee nothing re&s;embling it. At his own de&s;ire it was adorned with the figure of a &s;phere in&s;cribed in a cylinder, but had not been lo&s;t by his ungrateful countrymen, even before the time that Cicero was quae&s;tor of Sicily. It is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, with what eagerne&s;s this great man undertakes the &s;earch of it, and with what exultation he de&s;cribes his triumph on the di&s;covery. <Q>Ego autem

<P>The Catacombs are a great work; little inferior either to tho&s;e of Rome or Naples, and in the &s;ame &s;tile. There are many remains of temples. The Duke of Montalbano, who has written on the antiquities of Syracu&s;e, reckons near twenty; but there is hardly any of the&s;e that are now di&s;tingui&s;hable. A few fine columns of that of Jupiter Olympus &s;till remain; and the temple of Minerva (now converted into the cathedral of the city, and dedicated to the Virgin) is almo&s;t entire. They have lately built a new fa&ccedil;cade to it; but I am afraid they have not improved on the &s;implicity of the antique. It is full of broken pedi|ments, and I think in a bad &s;tile.</P>
<P>Ortigia, the only remaining part of Syracu&s;e, was anciently an i&s;land; it is often denominated &s;uch by Virgil, Cicero, and many of the Greek and Latin hi&s;torians. In latter ages, and probably by the ruins of this mighty city, the &s;trait that &s;eparated it from the continent, was filled up; and it had now been a pen|in&s;ula for many ages; 'till the pre&s;ent king of Spain,
<PB N="151" REF="024150_0161_0FC3C0ABA544E0D8">
at a va&s;t expence, cut through the neck of land that joined it to Sicily, and has again reduced it to its prim|itive &s;tate.</P>
<P>Here he has rai&s;ed a noble fortification, which ap|pears to be almo&s;t impregnable. There are four &s;trong gates, one within the other, with each a glacis, covered way, &s;carp and counter&s;carp, and a broad deep ditch filled with &s;ea-water, and defended by an im|men&s;e number of embra&s;ures; but not &s;o much as one &s;ingle piece of artillery. This you will no doubt think ridiculous enough, but the ridicule is &s;till height|ened, when I a&s;&s;ure you there is not a cannon of any kind belonging to this noble fortre&s;s, but one &s;mall battery of &s;ix pounders for &s;aluting &s;hips that go in and out of the port. If you are at a lo&s;s to account for this, you will plea&s;e remember that it is a work of the king of Spain. However, the ditches are very u&s;eful; they are perpetually covered with fi&s;hing boats; and they can u&s;e their nets and lines here with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, even in the mo&s;t &s;tormy weather; though I dare &s;ay this was none of the motives that induced his maje&s;ty to make them. The nobility of the place have likewi&s;e barges here, for their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>As the celebrated fountain of Arethu&s;a has ever been looked upon as one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities of Syracu&s;e, you may believe we were not a little impatient to examine it: And indeed only by ob&s;erving Cicero's account of it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In hoc in&s;ula extrema e&s;t fons aquae dulcis, cui nomen Arethu&s;a e&s;t, incredibili magnitudine pleni&s;&s;imus pi&s;cium, qui fluctu totus operiretur, ni&s;i munitione, ac mole lapi|dum a mari disjunctus e&s;&s;et, &amp;c.</NOTE> we &s;oon found it out, It &s;till exactly

an&s;wers the de&s;cription he gives, except with regard to the great quantities of fi&s;h it contained, which &s;eem now to have abandoned it.</P>
<P>The fountain of Arethu&s;a was dedicated to Diana, who had a magnificent temple near it, where great fe&s;tivals were annually celebrated in honour of the godde&s;s. We found a number of nymphs, up to the knees in the fountain, bu&s;y wa&s;hing their garments, and we dreaded the fate of Actaeon and Alpheus: But if the&s;e were of Diana's train, they are by no means &s;o coy as they were of old; and a man would hardly chu&s;e to run the ri&s;k of being changed either into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ag or a river for the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>It is indeed an a&s;toni&s;hing fountain; and ri&s;es at once out of the earth, to the &s;ize of a river. The poetical fictions concerning it are too well known to require that I &s;hould enumerate them. Many of the people here believe to this day, that it is the identical river Arethu&s;a, that &s;inks under ground near Olympia in Greece, and continuing its cour&s;e for five or &s;ix hundred miles below the ocean, ri&s;es again in this &s;pot.</P>
<P>It is truly a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;uch a &s;tory as this &s;hould have gained &s;uch credit among&s;t the ancients, for it is not only their poets, but natural hi&s;torians and philo&s;o|phers too, that take notice of it. Pliny mentions it more than once; and there are few or none of the Latin poets that it has e&s;caped.</P>
<P>This &s;trange belief has been communicated to the Sicilian authors, and, what is amazing, there is hardly any of them that doubts of it. Pomponius Mela, Pau&s;anias, Ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, and Fazzello, are all of the &s;ame &s;entiments; to &s;upport which they tell you the old
<PB N="153" REF="024150_0163_0FC3C0B1CA83E8E8">
&s;tory of the golden cup won at the Olympic games, which was thrown into the Grecian Arethu&s;a, and was &s;oon after ca&s;t up again by the Sicilian one.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e add, that it had always been ob&s;erved that after the great &s;acrifices at Olympia, the blood of which fell into that river, the waters of Arethu&s;a ro&s;e for &s;everal days, tinged with blood.</P>
<P>This, like many modern miracles, was probably a trick of the prie&s;ts. Tho&s;e of Diana had the charge of the fountain of Arethu&s;a, and no doubt were much intere&s;ted to &s;upport the credit of the &s;tory; for it was that godde&s;s that converted the nymph Arethu&s;a into a river, and conducted her &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages from Greece to Sicily, to avoid the pur&s;uit of Alphe|us, who underwent the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from the fountain of Arethu&s;a, there is a very large &s;pring of fre&s;h water, that boils up in the &s;ea. It is called <HI>Occhi di Zilica,</HI> and by &s;ome Alpheus, who is &s;uppo&s;ed by the poets to have pur&s;ued Arethu&s;a below the &s;ea all the way to Sicily.</P>
<P>As this &s;pring is not taken notice of by any of the great number of the ancients that &s;peak of Arethu&s;a, it is mo&s;t probable that it did not then exi&s;t; and is a part of that fountain that has &s;ince bur&s;t out before its arrival at the i&s;land of Ortigia. Had it been vi&s;ible in the time of the Greeks, there is no doubt that they would have made u&s;e of this, as a &s;trong argument to prove the &s;ubmarine journey of Arethu&s;a; as it in fact ri&s;es at &s;ome di&s;tance in the &s;ea, and pretty much in the &s;ame direction that Greece lies from Ortigia. It &s;ome|times boils up &s;o &s;trongly, that after piercing the &s;alt-water, I am told it can be taken up very little affected by it.</P>
<P>Syracu&s;e has two harbours; the large&s;t of which,
<PB N="154" REF="024150_0164_0FC3C0B36D896110">
on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of Ortigia, is reckoned &s;ix miles round, and was e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t in the Medi|terranean. It is &s;aid by Diodorus to have run almo&s;t into the heart of the city, and was called Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, becau&s;e entirely &s;urrounded with buildings of marble; the entry into this harbour was &s;trongly fortified, and the Roman fleets could never penetrate into it.</P>
<P>The &s;mall port is on the north-ea&s;t of Ortigia, and is likewi&s;e recorded to have been highly ornamented. Fazzello &s;ays, there is &s;till the remains of a &s;ubmarine aqueduct, that runs through the middle of it, which was intended to convey the water from the fountain of Arethu&s;a to the other parts of the city.</P>
<P>Near this port, they &s;hew the &s;pot where Archime|des' hou&s;e &s;tood; and likewi&s;e the tower from whence he is &s;aid to have &s;et fire to the Roman galleys with his burning-gla&s;&s;es; a &s;tory which is related by &s;everal authors, but which is now almo&s;t univer&s;ally exploded, from the difficulty to conceive a burning-gla&s;s or a concave &s;peculum, with a focus of &s;uch an immen&s;e length as this mu&s;t have required.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hould be apt to imagine if this be not entirely a fiction (of which there is &s;ome probability) that it was neither performed by refracting burning-gla&s;&s;es nor &s;peculums, but only by means of common looking-gla&s;&s;es, or very clear plates of metal. Indeed, from the &s;ituation of the place it mu&s;t have been done by reflection; for Archimedes' tower &s;tood on the north of the little port where the Roman fleet are &s;aid to have been moored; &s;o that their ve&s;&s;els lay in a right line betwixt him and the &s;un at noon; and at a very, &s;mall di&s;tance from the wall of the city where this tower &s;tood. But if you will &s;uppo&s;e this to have been performed by common burning-gla&s;&s;es, or by tho&s;e of
<PB N="155" REF="024150_0165_0FC3C0B4A55DF2D0">
the parabolical kind, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a tower of a mo&s;t enormous height on the i&s;land of Ortigia, in order to interpo&s;e the&s;e gla&s;&s;es betwixt the &s;un and the Roman galleys; and even this could not have been done 'till late in the afternoon, when his rays are exceedingly weak. But I have very little doubt that common looking-gla&s;&s;es would be found all-suf|ficient to perform the&s;e effects.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that a thou&s;and of the&s;e were made to reflect the rays to the &s;ame point: The heat, in all probability, mu&s;t be increa&s;ed to a greater degree than in the focus of mo&s;t burning-gla&s;&s;es; and abundantly capable of &s;etting fire to every combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tance. This experiment might be ea&s;ily made by means of a battalion of men, arming each with a looking-gla&s;s in&s;tead of a firelock; and &s;etting up a board at two or three hundred yards di&s;tance for them to fire at. I &s;uppo&s;e it would take a con&s;iderable time before they were expert at this exerci&s;e; but, by practice, I have no doubt that they might all be brought to hit the mark in&s;tantaneou&s;ly at the word of command; like the lark-catchers in &s;ome countries, who are &s;o dextrous at this manoeuvre, that with a &s;mall mirror they throw the rays of light on the lark, let her be ever &s;o high in the air; which, by a kind of fa&s;cination, brings down the poor animal to the &s;nare.</P>
<P>You may laugh at all this; but I don't think it is impo&s;&s;ible that a looking-gla&s;s may one day be thought as nece&s;&s;ary an implement for a &s;oldier as at pre&s;ent it is for a beau. I am very apprehen&s;ive the French will get the &s;tart of us in this &s;ignal invention; as I have been a&s;&s;ured long ago, that few of their men ever go to the field, without fir&s;t providing them&s;elves with one of the&s;e little warlike engines, the true u&s;e of

which, happily for us, they are as yet unacquainted with. You will ea&s;ily perceive, that if this experiment &s;ucceeds, it mu&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the whole &s;y&s;tem of fortification, as well as of attack and defence; for every part of the city that is expo&s;ed to the view of the be&s;iegers, may be ea&s;ily &s;et in a flame; and the be&s;ieged would have the &s;ame advantage over the camp of the be&s;ieging army.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the writing of the&s;e letters, the author has been informed, that Mr. Buffoon actually made this expe|riment.&mdash;He con&s;tructed a kind of frame, in which were fixed four hundred &s;mall mirrors, di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the rays reflected from each of them fell exactly on the &s;ame point. By means of this he melted lead at the di&s;tance of 120 feet, and &s;et fire to a hay&s;tack at a much greater di&s;tance.</NOTE></P>
<P>We are already completely tired of Syracu&s;e, which of all the wretched places we have yet met with, is by many degrees the mo&s;t wretched: For be&s;ides that its inhabitants are &s;o extremely poor and beggarly, many of them are &s;o over-run with the itch, that we are un|der perpetual apprehen&s;ions, and begin to be extremely well &s;atisfied that we could not procure beds.&mdash;It is truly melancholy to think of the di&s;mal contra&s;t that its former magnificence makes with its pre&s;ent meanne&s;s. The mighty Syracu&s;e, the mo&s;t opulent and powerful of all the Grecian cities, which, by its own proper &s;trength alone, was able, at different times, to contend again&s;t all the power of Carthage and of Rome: which is recorded (what the force of united nations is now incapable of) to have repul&s;ed fleets of two thou&s;and &s;ail, and armies of two hundred thou&s;and men; and contained within its own walls, what no city ever did before or &s;ince, fleets and armies that were the terror of the world. This haughty and magnificent city,

reduced even below the conference of the mo&s;t in&s;ig|nificant burgh! "Sic tran&s;it gloria mundi."&mdash;I have not even been able to procure a table to write upon, but by way of &s;uccedanoum am obliged to lay a form over the back of two chairs. We have got in|to the mo&s;t wretched hovel you can conceive, and the mo&s;t dirty; but what is &s;till wor&s;t of all, we can find nothing to eat; and if we had not brought &s;ome cold fowls along with us, we might have &s;tarved.</P>
<P>The heat has been con&s;iderably greater here than at Catania. The thermometer is ju&s;t now at 78.

<P>AS we found the mighty city of Syracu&s;e &s;o redu|ced, that it could not afford beds and lodging to three weary travellers, we agreed to abridge our &s;tay in it; and accordingly hired a Malte&s;e Sparonaro to carry us to that i&s;land: This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">all &s;ix-oar'd boat, made entirely for &s;peed, to avoid the African pirates, and
<PB N="158" REF="024150_0168_0FC3C0B942FDCEE0">
other Barbare&s;que ve&s;&s;els, with which the&s;e &s;eas are infe&s;ted, but &s;o flat and &s;o narrow, that they are not able to bear any &s;ea, and of con&s;equence keep always as near the coa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the 2d of June, by day-break, we left the Marmoreo, or great port of Syracu&s;e, and although the wind was exactly contrary and pretty &s;trong, by the force of their oars, which they manage with great dex|terity, we got on at the rate of four miles an hour. They do not pull their oars as we do, but pu&s;h them like the Venetian Gondoliers; always fronting the prow of the boat, and &s;eldom or never &s;it down while they row; allowing the whole weight of their bodies to be exerted every &s;troke of the ear. This gives a prodigious momentum, and is certainty much more forcible than a &s;imple exertion of the mu&s;cles of the arm.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock the wind became favorable, when we went indeed at an immen&s;e rate. At twelve it blew a hurricane, and with &s;ome difficulty we got under &s;hore, but the wind was &s;o exceedingly violent, that even there we had like to have been over&s;et, and we were obliged to run aground to &s;ave us from that di&s;a&s;ter. Here we were a good deal annoyed by the &s;and carried about by the wind; however, the hurricane was &s;oon over, and we again put to &s;ea with a favor|able gale, which in a few hours carried us to Capo Pa&s;&s;ero.</P>
<P>In this little &s;torm we were a good deal amu&s;ed with the behaviour of our Sicilian &s;ervant, who at land is a fellow of undaunted courage, of which we have had many proofs; but here (I don't know why) it entirely for&s;ook him, although there was in fact no real danger,
<PB N="159" REF="024150_0169_0FC3C0BB031A7AB8">
for we never were more than 100 yards from the &s;hore. He gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and called upon all his &s;aints for protection: And never again recovered his confidence all the re&s;t of this little voyage; perpetually wi&s;hing him&s;elf back at Naples, and &s;wearing that no earthy temptation &s;hould ever induce him to go to &s;ea again. The &s;ame fellow, but a few days ago, mounted a mo&s;t vicious hou&s;e, and without the lea&s;t fear or concern galloped along the &s;ide of a precipice, where every moment we expected to &s;ee him da&s;hed to pieces; &s;o &s;ingular and various are the different modes of fear and of courage.</P>
<P>Capo Pa&s;&s;ero, anciently called Pachinus, is the re|mote&s;t and mo&s;t &s;outherly point of Sicily. It is not a penin&s;ula, as repre&s;ented in all the maps, but a wretch|ed barren i&s;land, of about a mile round; with a fort and a &s;mall garri&s;on to protect the neighbouring country, often very trouble&s;ome on this part of the coa&s;t. This little i&s;land and fort lie about a mile and a half di&s;tant from the &s;mall creek of which we have taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and are &s;eparated from the re&s;t of Sicily by a &s;trait of about half a mile board.</P>
<P>Our pilot told us that we mu&s;t not think of Malta, which is almo&s;t 100 miles off, 'till there were more &s;ettled appearances of good weather.</P>
<P>As there is no habitation here of any kind, we &s;earch|ed about, 'till at la&s;t we found a &s;mall cavern, where we made a very comfortable dinner. We then &s;allied forth to examine the face of the country, as well as to try if we could &s;hoot &s;omething for our &s;upper. We found that we had now got into a very different world from any thing we had yet &s;een. The country here
<PB N="160" REF="024150_0170_0FC3C0BC2F40AE00">
is exceedingly barren, and to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance produces neither corn nor wine: But the fields are adorned with an infinite variety of flowers and of flow|ering &s;hrubs, and the rocks are every where entirely covered with capers, which are ju&s;t now fit for gather|ing. If we had vinegar, we could &s;oon have pickled hog&s;heads of them.</P>
<P>We found here, in the greate&s;t perfection, that beautiful &s;hrub called the Palmeta, re&s;embling a &s;mall palm-tree, with an elegant fine flower: But to our great mortification, the &s;eed is not yet ripe. We like|wi&s;e found great quantities of a blue everla&s;ting flower, which I don't remember to have &s;een in Miller, or any of our botanical books. The &s;tem ri&s;es about a foot high, and is crowned with a large clu&s;ter of &s;mall blue flowers, the leaves of which are of a dry &s;ub&s;tance like the Elychry&s;um, or globe Amaranthus. Some of the&s;e are of a purple colour, but, mo&s;t of them blue. I have gathered a pretty large quantity for the &s;peculation of the botani&s;ts on our return.</P>
<P>We found a good &s;wimming-place, which is always one of the fir&s;t things we look out for, as this exerci&s;e con&s;titutes one of the principal plea&s;ures of our expedi|tion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was dark, we got on board our little boat, and rowed about a hundred yards out to &s;ea, where we ca&s;t anchor; our pilot a&s;&s;uring us that this was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as the people in this part of the country are little better than &s;avages; and, were we to &s;tay at land, might very po&s;&s;ibly come down during the night, and rob and murder us.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e told us, that the Turks had made fre|quent
<PB N="161" REF="024150_0171_0FC3C0BDD1A56138">
inva&s;ions upon this point of the i&s;land which, of all others, lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed to their depredations; that lately three of their chebecks ran into a &s;mall harbour a few miles from this, and carried off &s;ix merchant|&s;hips; and that very often, &s;ome of their light ve&s;&s;els were &s;een hovering off the coa&s;t; that the only way to be in perfect &s;ecurity from the&s;e two enimies by &s;ea and land, was to chu&s;e a place on the coa&s;t &s;o deep, that the banditti by land could not wade in to us; and at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;hallow, as to be equally inacce&s;&s;ible to the banditti by &s;ea.</P>
<P>When we found our&s;elves thus in &s;ecurity on both hands, we wrapt our&s;elves up in our cloaks and fell a&s;leep: However, we had but a very uncomfortable night; the wind ro&s;e, and the motion of our little bark was exceedingly di&s;agreeable, and made us heartily &s;ick. As &s;oon as day began to appear, we made them pull in to &s;hore; when we were immediately cured of our &s;ickne&s;s; and as the weather continues &s;till unfa|vourable, we have fallen upon a variety of amu&s;ements to pa&s;s the time.</P>
<P>We have been thrice in the water, which is warm and plea&s;ant; and in the intervals, I have written you this letter on the top of a large ba&s;ket, in which we carry our &s;ea-&s;tore. We have likewi&s;e gathered &s;hells, pieces of coral, of &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nge, and &s;everal beautiful kinds of &s;ea-weed. The rocks here are all of &s;and and gravel run together, and become as hard as granite. There are many &s;hells and other marine &s;ub&s;tances mixed in their compo&s;ition, which renders them objects of curio&s;ity in the eye of a naturali&s;t.</P>
<P>This morning we made a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of a &s;ail, drawn over the point of a rock, and fixed with an oar,
<PB N="162" REF="024150_0172_0FC3C0BF22DB10B0">
by way of pole. Here we breakfa&s;ted mo&s;t luxuriou&s;ly on excellent tea and honey of Hybla.</P>
<P>I was interrupted in this part of my letter, by an officer from the fort of Capo Pa&s;&s;ero. He tells us, that we may give over all thoughts of getting farther for the&s;e &s;ix days. What do you think is his rea&s;on? I own I was in &s;ome pain 'till he mentioned it. This wind &s;et in exactly as the moon entered her &s;econd quarter, and it will certainly continue 'till &s;he is full. There is a ra&s;cal for you! if he be telling truth, I &s;hall certainly &s;tudy a&s;trology. He likewi&s;e told us, that two galliots had been &s;een off the coa&s;t; and de&s;ired us to be upon our guard; but I own, the moon, together with other circum&s;tances, has con&s;iderably weakened his evidence with me.</P>
<P>We have learned from his conver&s;ation, that the fort of Capo Pa&s;&s;ero is made u&s;e of as a place of exile for the delinquents in the army; of which number I have not the lea&s;t doubt that he is one. He told us there were two near relations of the viceroy, that had been lately &s;ent there for mi&s;demeanors; that for his part, he belonged to a very agreeable garri&s;on; but as he loved retirement, he cho&s;e to accompany them. However, his countenance told a very different &s;tory; and &s;aid, in &s;trong language, that he was a <HI>tres mauvais &s;ujet.</HI> Be&s;ides, he is a &s;tupid fellow, and has tired me. I could learn nothing from him.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, this is an excellent place of exile for a young rake, who wants to &s;how away in the beau monde. It is not within many miles of any town or village; &s;o that the gentlemen may enjoy retirement in its utmo&s;t perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="024150_0173_0FC3C0C0CA5DC730">We were &s;urpri&s;ed to find on this coa&s;t quantities of the true pumice-&s;tone, which at fir&s;t we &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought by the &s;ea from Aetna, 'till we like|wi&s;e di&s;covered many large pieces of lava, which makes us imagine there mu&s;t have been &s;ome eruption of fire in this part of the i&s;land; yet I &s;ee no conical moun|tain, or any other indication of it.</P>
<P>If our officer's progno&s;tications prove true, and we are detained here any longer, I &s;hall examine the country to a much greater di&s;tance. The wind con|tinues directly contrary; the &s;ea is very high in the canal of Malta, and our Sicilian &s;ervant is in a &s;ad trepidation. But I &s;ee Glover and Fullarton coming for their dinner; &s;o I &s;hall be obliged to give up the ba&s;ket.&mdash;This &s;ea air gives one a mon&s;trous appe|tite; and, it is with grief I mention it, we are already brought to &s;hort allowance:&mdash;Only one cold fowl among three of us; all three pretty &s;harp &s;et, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;Tho&s;e infamous ra&s;cals to lo&s;e our turtle! They have &s;pied a fi&s;hing-boat, and are haling her as loud as they can roar, but, alas! &s;he is too far off to hear them.&mdash;They have ju&s;t fired a gun to bring her to, and happily &s;he obeys the &s;ignal, &s;o there are &s;till hopes; otherwi&s;e we &s;hall &s;oon be reduced to bread and water. Our tea and &s;ugar too are ju&s;t upon a clo&s;e, which is the cruele&s;t article of all; but we have plenty of good bread and Hybla honey; &s;o we are in no danger of &s;tarving.</P>
<P>We have likewi&s;e made an admirable and a very comfortable di&s;po&s;ition for our night's lodging. The Sparonaro is &s;o very narrow, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us all to lie in it; be&s;ides, we are eat up with vermin, and have nothing but the hard boards to lie on: All the&s;e con&s;iderations, added to the cur&s;ed &s;winging of

the boat, and the horrid &s;ickne&s;s it occa&s;ions, have determined us rather to tru&s;t our&s;elves to the mercy of the banditti, than to lie another night at &s;ea: Be&s;ides, we have made the happie&s;t di&s;covery in the world; a great quantity of fine, &s;oft, dry &s;ea-weed, lying under the &s;helter of a rock, and &s;eems intended by Providence for our bed: Over this we are going to &s;tretch a &s;ail, and expect to &s;leep mo&s;t luxuriou&s;ly; but to prevent all danger from a &s;urpri&s;e, we have agreed to &s;tand &s;entry by turns, with Fullarton's double-barrelled gun, well primed and loaded for the reception of the enemy; at the fir&s;t di&s;charge of which, and not before, the whole guard is to turn out, with all the remaining part of our artillery and &s;mall arms; and as our &s;ituation is a very advantageous one, I think we &s;hall be able to make a &s;tout defence.</P>
<P>As we are &s;ix in number, three ma&s;ters and three &s;ervants, the duty, you &s;ee, will be but trifling; and five of us will always &s;leep in &s;ecurity. Our guard, to be &s;ure, might have been &s;tronger: But our Spa|ronaro-men have ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to be of the party; having much more confidence in their own element; however, they have promi&s;ed, in ca&s;e of an attack, immediately to come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I think the di&s;po&s;ition is far from being bad one, and we are not a little vain of our general&s;hip.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hing-boat is now arrived, and they have bought &s;ome excellent little fi&s;hes, which are already on the fire. Adieu. The&s;e fellows are roaring for their cold fowl, and I can command the ba&s;ket no longer.</P>

<P>IN &s;pite of appearance, and our officer's wi&s;e prog|no&s;tications, the wind changed in the afternoon, and we got under &s;ail by &s;ix o'clock: We pa&s;&s;ed the Straits, and coa&s;ted along 'till eight, when landed to cook &s;ome macaroni we had purcha&s;ed of our &s;ailors, and try if we could &s;hoot &s;omething for &s;ea-&s;tore, as we have &s;till a long voyage before us.</P>
<P>We came to the &s;ide of a &s;ulphureous lake, the &s;mell of which was &s;o &s;trong, that we perceived it upwards of a mile di&s;tant. We found the water boil|ing up with violence in many places, though the heat at the banks of the lake is very incon&s;iderable. How|ever, this, added to the pumice and lava we found near Capo Pa&s;&s;ero, tends greatly to confirm us in the opin|ion, that this part of the i&s;land, as well as about Aetna, has, in former ages, been &s;ubject to eruptions of fire.</P>
<P>I think it is more than probable, that this is the celebrated Carmerina, which Aeneas &s;aw immediately after his pa&s;&s;ing Pachynus (or Capo Pa&s;&s;ero) which, Virgil &s;ays, the fates had decreed &s;hould never be drained:

<P>It is &s;urrounded with a variety of fine ever-greens, and flowering &s;hrubs, of which the palmeta, and the arbutus or &s;trawberry-tree, are the mo&s;t beautiful. We &s;aw a great many wild-fowls; but, what &s;urpri|&s;ed me, in &s;o unfrequented a place, they were &s;o &s;hy, that there was no getting near them: There was one kind, in particular, that attracted our attention; it was of the &s;ize and form of a grey plover, and flew in the &s;ame manner; but had a tail of a great length, which &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed only of two &s;mall flexi|ble feathers, that made a very uncommon appearance in the air. After u&s;ing all our art to &s;hoot one of them, we were obliged to give up the attempt.</P>
<P>Here we killed a &s;mall black &s;nake, which, I think, an&s;wers the de&s;cription I have &s;een of the a&s;p. We di&s;&s;ected out its tongue, the end of which appears &s;harp like a &s;ting, and I &s;uppo&s;e is one, as it darted out with violence again&s;t our &s;ticks, when we pre&s;ented them to it. Now as all animals, when attacked, make u&s;e of tho&s;e weapons that nature has armed them with for their defence, it appeared evident to us (&s;up|po&s;ing this rule a ju&s;t one) that this animal was con|&s;cious of a power of hurting in its tongue; and we have been more fully convinced of it from di&s;&s;ection. The &s;ting appears con&s;iderably larger than that of a bee. We found a little bag at the other end of the tongue, and probably, if we had had a micro&s;cope, &s;hould have found the tongue perforated. This &s;nake had no teeth; but very hard gums. I have taken care to pre&s;erve the tongue for your in&s;pection.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="024150_0177_0FC3C0C719A61210">As I think it has always been &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;erpents hurt only with their teeth, I thought this might be worthy of your notice. It is true, that the darting out of the tongue is a trick of the whole &s;erpent tribe; but this animal &s;eemed to do it with peculiar ferocity, and to &s;trike it with violence again&s;t our &s;ticks. It was this that put us upon the examination.</P>
<P>I don't recollect that this &s;ingularity is mentioned in any book of natural hi&s;tory, but po&s;&s;ibly I may be mi&s;taken; nor indeed do I remember either to have &s;een or heard of any animal armed in this manner. Unle&s;s you will &s;uppo&s;e me to adopt the &s;entiments of poor Mr. S&mdash;, who, ever &s;ince his marriage, alledg|es that the tongues of many females, are formed after this &s;ingular manner; and remarks one peculiarity, that the &s;ting &s;eldom or never appears 'till after mat|rimony.&mdash;He is very learned on this &s;ubject, and thinks it may po&s;&s;ibly have proceeded from their origi|nal connection with the &s;erpent. Let this be as it may, I &s;incerely hope that you and I &s;hall never have &s;uch good rea&s;on for adopting that opinion.</P>
<P>A little after nine we embarked. The night was delightful; but the wind had died away about &s;un-&s;et, and we were obliged to ply our oars to get into the canal of Malta. The coa&s;t of Sicily began to recede; and in a &s;hort time, we found our&s;elves in the ocean. There was a profound &s;ilence, except the noi&s;e of the waves breaking on the di&s;tant &s;hore, which only &s;erv|ed to render it more &s;olemn. It was a dead calm, and the moon &s;hone bright on the waters: The waves, from the late &s;torm, were &s;till high; but &s;mooth and even, and followed one another with a &s;low and equal pace. The &s;cene had naturally &s;unk us into medita|tion; we had remained near an hour without &s;peaking
<PB N="168" REF="024150_0178_0FC3C0C8434BB830">
a word, when our &s;ailors began their midnight hymn to the Virgin. The mu&s;ic was &s;imple, &s;olemn, and melancholy, and in perfect harmony with the &s;cene, and with all our feelings. They beat exact time with their oars, and ob&s;erved the harmony and the cadence with the almo&s;t preci&s;ion. We li&s;tened with infinite plea&s;ure to this melancholy concert, and felt the vanity of operas and oratorios. There is often a &s;olemnity and a pathetic in the modulation of the&s;e &s;imple pro|ductions, that cau&s;es a much &s;tronger effect, than the compo&s;ition of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the boa&s;ted rules of counter-point.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they &s;ung us a&s;leep, and we awoke forty miles di&s;tant from Sicily. We were now on the main ocean, and &s;aw no land but mount Aetna; which is the perpetual polar-&s;tar of the&s;e &s;eas. We had a fine breeze, and about two o'clock we di&s;covered the i&s;land of Malta; and in le&s;s than three hours more, we reached the city of Valetta. The approach of the i&s;land is very fine, although the &s;hore is rather low and rocky. It is every where made inacce&s;&s;ible to an enemy, by an infinite number of fortifications. The rock, in many places, has been &s;loped into the form of a glacis, with &s;trong parapets and intrenchments running behind it.</P>
<P>The entry into the port is very narrow, and is commanded by a &s;trong ca&s;tle on either &s;ide. We were hailed from each of the&s;e, and obliged to give a &s;trict account of our&s;elves; and on our arrival at the &s;ide of the key, we were vi&s;ited by an officer from the health-office, and obliged to give oath with regard to the circum&s;tances of our voyage.&mdash;He behaved in the civile&s;t manner, and immediately &s;ent us Mr. Rutter, the Engli&s;h con&s;ul, for whom we had letters of rec|ommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="024150_0179_0FC3C0C9B67C3248">On getting on &s;hore, we found our&s;elves in a new world indeed.&mdash;The &s;treets crowded with well-dre&s;&s;ed people, who have all the appearance of health and affluence; whereas at Syracu&s;e, there was &s;carce a creature to be &s;een; and even tho&s;e few had the appearance of di&s;ea&s;e and wretchedne&s;s.&mdash;Mr. Rutter immediately conducted us to an inn, which had more the appearance of a palace. We have had an excellent &s;upper, and good Burgundy; and as this is the king's birth-day, we have almo&s;t got tip&s;y to his health. We are now going into clean, comfortable beds, in expec|tation of the &s;weete&s;t &s;lumbers. Think of the luxury of this, after being five long days without throwing off our cloaths. Good night. I would not lo&s;e a mo|ment of it for the world. People may &s;ay what they plea&s;e, but there is no enjoyment in living in perpetual ea&s;e and affluence, and the true luxury is only to be attained by undergoing a few hard&s;hips. But this is no time to philo&s;ophi&s;e. So adieu.</P>

<P>OUR banker, Mr. Pou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ach, was here before we were up, inviting us to dine with him at his coun|try-hou&s;e, from whence we are ju&s;t now returned. He gave us a noble entertainment, &s;erved on plate, with an elegant de&s;ert, and a great variety of wines.</P>
<P>After dinner we went to vi&s;it the principal villas of the i&s;land; particularly tho&s;e of the grand ma&s;ter, and the general of the gallies, which lie con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igious to each

other. The&s;e are nothing great or magnificent; but they are admirably contrived for a hot climate, where, of all things, &s;hade is the mo&s;t de&s;irable. The orange groves are indeed very fine, and the fruit they bear is &s;uperior to any thing you have &s;een either in Spain or Portugal.</P>
<P>The a&s;pect of the country is far from being plea&s;ing: The whole i&s;land is a great rock of very white free &s;tone, and the &s;oil that covers this rock, in mo&s;t pla|ces, is not more than five or &s;ix inches deep; yet, what is &s;ingular, we found their crop in general was exceedingly abundant. They account for it from the copious dews that fall during the &s;pring and &s;ummer months; and pretend likewi&s;e, that there is a moi&s;ture in the rock below the &s;oil, that is of great advantage to the corn and cotton, keeping its roots perpetually moi&s;t and cool; without which &s;ingular quality, they &s;ay, they could have no crops at all, the heat of the &s;un is &s;o exceedingly violent.</P>
<P>Their barley harve&s;t has been over &s;ome time ago; and they are ju&s;t now fini&s;hing that of the wheat. The whole i&s;land produces corn only &s;ufficient to &s;upport its inhabitants for five months, or little more; but the crop they mo&s;t depend upon is the cotton. They began &s;owing it about three weeks ago, and it will be fini&s;hed in a week more. The time of reaping it is in the month of October, and beginning of November.</P>
<P>They pretend that the cotton produced from this plant, which is &s;own and reaped in four months, is of a much &s;uperior quality to that of the cotton-tree. I compared them, but I cannot &s;ay I found it &s;o; this is indeed the fine&s;t, but that of the cotton-tree is by much the &s;tronge&s;t texture. The plant ri&s;es to the height
<PB N="171" REF="024150_0181_0FC3C0D67B416F00">
of a foot and a half, and is covered with a number of nuts or pods full of cotton: The&s;e, when ripe, they are at great pains to cut off, every morning before &s;un-ri&s;e; for the heat of the &s;un immediately turns the cotton yellow; which, indeed, we &s;aw from tho&s;e pods they &s;ave for &s;eed.</P>
<P>They manufacture their cotton into a great variety of &s;tuffs. Their &s;tockings are exceedingly fine. Some of them, they a&s;&s;ured us, had beed &s;old for ten &s;equins a pair. Their coverlids and blankets are e&s;teemed all over Europe. Of the&s;e the principal manufactures are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the little i&s;land of Goz|zo, where the people are &s;aid to be more indu&s;trious than tho&s;e of Malta, as they are more excluded from the world, and have fewer inducements to idlene&s;s. Here the &s;ugar-cane is &s;till cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s though not in any con&s;iderable quantity.</P>
<P>The Malt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e oranges certainly de&s;erve the character they have, of being the fine&s;t in the world. The &s;ea&s;on continues for upwards of &s;even months; from November 'till the middle of June; during which time, tho&s;e beautiful trees are always covered with abundance of this delicious fruit. Many of them are of the red kind, much &s;uperior, in my opinion, to the other, which are rather too lu&s;cious. They are pro|duced, I am told, from the common orange-bud, en|grafted on the pomegranate &s;tock. The juice of this fruit is red as blood, and of a fine flavour. The great|e&s;t part of their crop is &s;ent in pre&s;ents to the different courts of Europe, and to the relations of the chevaliers. It was not without a good deal of difficulty that we procured a few che&s;ts for our friends at Naples.</P>
<P>The indu&s;try of the Malte&s;e in cultivating their
<PB N="172" REF="024150_0182_0FC3C0E21B9A6418">
little i&s;land is inconceivable. There is not an inch of ground lo&s;t in any part of it; and where there was not &s;oil enough, they have brought over &s;hips and boats loaded with it from Sicily, where there is plenty and to &s;pare. The whole i&s;land is full of inclo&s;ures of free-&s;tone, which gives the country a very uncouth and a very barren a&s;pect; and, in &s;ummer, reflects &s;uch a light and heat, that it is exceedingly di&s;agreeable and offen&s;ive to the eyes. The inclo&s;ures are very &s;mall and irregular, according to the inclination of the ground. This, they &s;ay, they are obliged to ob&s;erve, notwith&s;tanding the deformity it occa&s;ions; otherwi&s;e the floods, to which they are &s;ubject, would &s;oon carry off their &s;oil.</P>
<P>The i&s;land is covered over with country hou&s;es and villages, be&s;ides &s;even cities, for &s;o they term them; but there are only two, the Valetta and the Citta Vecchia, that by any means de&s;erve that appellation. Every little village has a noble church, elegantly fini&s;hed and adorned with &s;tatues of marble, rich tape&s;try, and a large quantity of &s;ilver plate. They are by much the hand&s;ome&s;t country churches I have ever &s;een.&mdash;But I am interrupted in my writing by the beginning (I am told) of a very fine &s;how. If it be &s;o, I &s;hall give you &s;ome account of it by and by.</P>
<P>Eleven at night. The &s;how is now fini&s;hed and has afforded us great entertainment. It was the departure of a Malte&s;e &s;quadron to a&s;&s;i&s;t the French again&s;t the Boy of Tunis, who, it &s;eems, has fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the grand monarque, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to deliver up without ran&s;om, the Cor&s;ican &s;laves that were taken before the French were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land. The &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted of three gallies; the large&s;t with nine hundred men, each
<PB N="173" REF="024150_0183_0FC3C0E3A6A3EFF0">
of the others with &s;even hundred; three galliots, and &s;everal <HI>&s;campavias,</HI> &s;o called from their exceeding &s;wift|ne&s;s. The&s;e immen&s;e bodies were all worked by oars, and moved with great regularity. The admiral went fir&s;t, and the re&s;t in order, according to their dignity. The &s;ea was crowded with boats, and the ramparts and fortifications were filled with company. The port re&s;ounded on all &s;ides with the di&s;charge of heavy artillery, which was an&s;wered by the gallies and galliots as they left the harbour. As the echo is here uncommonly great, it produced a very noble effect.</P>
<P>There were about thirty knights in each galley, making &s;ignals all the way to their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were weeping for their departure upon the ba&s;tions; for the&s;e gentlemen pay almo&s;t as little regard to their vows of cha&s;tity, as the prie&s;ts and confe&s;&s;ors do. After view|ing the &s;how from the ramparts, we took a boat and followed the &s;quadron for &s;ome time, and did not return till long after &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>We have been admiring the wonderful &s;trength of this place, both by nature and art. It is certainly the happie&s;t &s;ituation that can be imagined. The city &s;tands upon a penin&s;ula, betwixt two of the fine&s;t ports in the world, which are defended by almo&s;t impregnable fortifications. That on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the city is the large&s;t. It runs about two miles into the heart of the i&s;land, and is &s;o very deep, and &s;urrounded by &s;uch high grounds and fortifications, that they a&s;&s;ured us, the large&s;t &s;hips of war might ride here in the mo&s;t &s;tor|my weather, almo&s;t without a cable.</P>
<P>This beautiful ba&s;on is divided into five di&s;tinct har|bours, all equally &s;afe, and each capable of containing an immen&s;e number of &s;hipping. The mouth of the
<PB N="174" REF="024150_0184_0FC3C0E4B3E51C48">
harbour is &s;carcely a quarter of a mile broad, and is commanded on each &s;ide by batteries that would tear the &s;tronge&s;t &s;hip to pieces before &s;he could enter. Be&s;ides this, it is fronted by a quadruple battery, one above the other, the large&s;t of which is a <HI>fleur d'eau,</HI> or on a level with the water. The&s;e are mounted with about 80 of their heavie&s;t artillery; &s;o that this harbour, I think, may really be con&s;idered as impreg|nable; and indeed the Turks have ever found it &s;o, and I believe ever will.</P>
<P>The harbour on the north &s;ide of the city, although they only u&s;e it for fi&s;hing, and as a place of quaran|tine, would, in any other part of the world, be con|&s;idered as ine&s;timable. It is likewi&s;e defended by very &s;trong works; and in the cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of the ba&s;on there is an i&s;land on which they have built a ca&s;tle and a lazaret.</P>
<P>The fortifications of Malta are indeed a mo&s;t &s;tu|pendous work. All the boa&s;ted catacombs of Rome and Naples are a trifle to the immen&s;e excavations that have been made in this little i&s;land. The ditches, of a va&s;t &s;ize, are all cut out of the &s;olid rock. The&s;e extend for a great many miles; and rai&s;e our a&s;toni&s;h|ment to think that &s;o &s;mall a &s;tate has ever been able to make them.</P>
<P>One &s;ide of the i&s;land is &s;o completely fortified by nature, that there was nothing left for art. The rock is of a great height, and ab&s;olutely perpendicular from the &s;ea for &s;everal miles. It is very &s;ingular, that on this &s;ide there are &s;till the ve&s;tiges of &s;everal ancient roads, with the tracks of carriages worn deep into the rocks: The&s;e roads are now terminated by the preci|pice, with the &s;ea beneath; and &s;hew to a demon&s;tra|tion,
<PB N="175" REF="024150_0185_0FC3C0E62DC2B0F0">
that this i&s;land has in former ages been of a much larger &s;ize than it is at pre&s;ent; but the convul&s;ion that occa&s;ioned its diminution is probably much beyond the reach of any hi&s;tory or tradition. It has often been ob&s;erved, notwith&s;tanding the very great di&s;tance of mount Aetna, that this i&s;land has generally been more or le&s;s affected by its eruptions, and they think it probable, that on &s;ome of tho&s;e occa&s;ions a part of it may have been &s;haken into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>We have now an opportunity of ob&s;erving that one half of mount Aetna is clearly di&s;covered from Malta. They reckon the di&s;tance near 200 Italian miles. And the people here a&s;&s;ure us, that in the great erup|tions of that mountain, their whole i&s;land is illumina|ted; and from the reflection in the water, there appears a great track of fire in the &s;ea all the way from Malta to Sicily. The thundering of the mountain is like|wi&s;e di&s;tinctly heard. Good night. I am fatigued with this day's expedition, and &s;hall fini&s;h my letter to-morrow.</P>
<P>June 6th. As the city of Valetta is built upon a hill, none of the &s;treets except the key are level. They are all paved with white free-&s;tone, which not only cre|ates a great du&s;t, but from its colour is likewi&s;e &s;o offen&s;ive to the eyes, that mo&s;t of the people here are remarkably weak-&s;ighted. The principal buildings are the palace of the grand ma&s;ter&punc; the infirmary, the ar&s;enal, the inns or hotels of the &s;even Tongues, and the great church of St. John. The palace is a noble though a plain &s;tructure, and the grand ma&s;ter (who &s;tudies convenience more than magnificence) is more comfortably and Commodiou&s;ly lodged than any prince in Europe, the king of Sardinia perhaps only excepted. The great &s;tair is the ea&s;ie&s;t and the be&s;t I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="024150_0186_0FC3C0E7E6223CD0">St. John's is a magnificent church. The pave|ment, in particular, is reckoned the riche&s;t in the world. It is entirely compo&s;ed of &s;epulchral monuments of the fine&s;t marbles, prophyry, lapis lazuli, and a variety of other valuable &s;tones, admirably joined together, and at an incredible expen&s;e; repre&s;enting in a kind of Mo&s;aic, the arms, in&s;ignia, &amp;c. of the per&s;ons who&s;e names they are intended to commemorate. In the magnificence of the&s;e monuments, the heirs of the grand ma&s;ters and commanders have long vied with each other.</P>
<P>We went this day to &s;ee the celebration of their church &s;ervice. It &s;eems to be more overcharged with parade and ceremony than what I have ever ob|&s;erved even in any other catholic country. The number of genuflections before the altar, the ki&s;&s;ing of the prior's hand, the holding up of his robes by the &s;ubaltern prie&s;ts, the ceremony of throwing incen&s;e upon all the knights of the great cro&s;s, and neglecting the poorer knights, with many other articles, appeared to us highly ridiculous; and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially different indeed from that purity and &s;implicity of wor&s;hip that con&s;titutes the very e&s;&s;ence of true chri&s;tianity; and of which the great pattern they pretend to copy, &s;et &s;o very noble an example.</P>
<P>This day (the 6th of June) is held as a thank&s;giv|ing for their deliverance from a terrible con&s;piracy that was formed about twenty-one years ago, by the Turk|i&s;h &s;laves; at one &s;troke to put an end to the whole order of Malta. All the fountains of the place were to be poi&s;oned; and every &s;lave had taken a &s;olemn oath to put his ma&s;ter to death.</P>
<P>It was di&s;covered by a Jew, who kept a coffee-hou&s;e.
<PB N="177" REF="024150_0187_0FC3C0E956069878">
He under&s;tood the Turki&s;h language, and overheard &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e that he thought &s;u&s;picious. He went immediately and informed the grand ma&s;ter. The &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were in&s;tantly &s;eized and put to the torture, and &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed the whole plot. The executions were &s;hocking. One hundred and twenty-five were put to death by various torments. Some were burned alive, &s;ome were broken on the wheel, and &s;ome were torn to pieces by the four galleys rowing different ways, and each bringing off its limb. Since that time, the &s;laves have been much more &s;trictly watched, and have le&s;s liberty than formerly. Adieu. I &s;hall write to you again before we leave Malta.</P>

<P>THIS day we made an expedition through the i&s;land in coaches drawn by one mule each; the only kind of vehicle the place affords. Our conductors could &s;peak nothing but Arabic, which is &s;till the lan|guage of the common people of Malta; &s;o that you may believe we did not reap much benefit from their conver&s;ation. We went fir&s;t to the ancient city of Melita, which is near the center of the i&s;land, and commands a view of the whole; and in clear weather, they pretend, of part of Barbary, and of Sicily. The city is &s;trongly fortified, and is governed by an officer called the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om. He received us very politely, and &s;hewed us the old palace, which is not indeed much
<PB N="178" REF="024150_0188_0FC3C0EAC3756FE0">
worth the &s;eeing. The cathedral is a very fine church; and although of an exceeding large &s;ize, is at pre&s;ent entirely hung with crim&s;on dama&s;k richly laced with gold.</P>
<P>The catacombs, not far from this city, are a great work. They are &s;aid to extend for fifteen miles under ground; however, this you are obliged to take on the credit of your guides, as it would ratner be ri&s;king too much to put it to the trial. Many people, they a&s;&s;ure us, have been lo&s;t from advancing too far in them; the prodigious number of branches making it next to impo&s;&s;ible to find the way out again.</P>
<P>From this we went to &s;ee the Bo&s;quetta, where the grand ma&s;ter has his country-palace; by the accounts we had of it at Valetta, we expected to find a fore&s;t &s;tored with deer and every kind of game, as they talked much of the great hunts that were made every year in the&s;e woods. We were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find only a few &s;cattered trees, and about half a dozen deer: But as this is the only thing like a wood in the i&s;land, it is e&s;teemed a very great curio&s;ity. The palace is as little worth &s;eeing as the fore&s;t; though indeed the pro&s;pect from the top of it is very fine. The furniture is three or four hundred years old, and in the mo&s;t Gothic ta&s;te that can be imag|ined: But indeed the grand ma&s;ter &s;eldom or never re&s;ides here.</P>
<P>The great &s;ource of water that &s;upplies the city of Valetta, takes its ri&s;e near to this place; and there is an aqueduct compo&s;ed of &s;ome thou&s;and arches, that con|veys it from thence to the city. The whole of this immen&s;e work was fini&s;hed at the private expence of one of the grand ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="024150_0189_0FC3C0ECB3CE3118">Not far from the old city there is a &s;mall church, dedicated to St. Paul; and ju&s;t by the church, a miraculous &s;tatue of the &s;aint with a viper on his hand; &s;uppo&s;ed to be placed on the very &s;pot on which the hou&s;e &s;tood where he was received after his &s;hipwreck on this i&s;land, and where he &s;hook the viper off his hand into the fire without being hurt by it: At which time the Malte&s;e a&s;&s;ure us the &s;aint cur&s;ed all the venomous animals of the i&s;land, and bani&s;hed them for ever; ju&s;t as St. Patrick treated tho&s;e of his favourite i&s;le. Whether this be the cau&s;e of it or not, we &s;hall leave to divines to determine, (though if it had, I think St. Luke would have mentioned it in the acts of the Apo&s;tles) but the fact is certain, that there are no venomous animals in Malta. They a&s;&s;ured us that vipers had been brought from Sicily, and died almo&s;t immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the church there is the celebrated grotto in which the &s;aint was impri&s;oned. It is look|ed upon with the utmo&s;t reverence and veneration; and if the &s;tories they tell of it be true, it is well inti|tled to it all. It is exceedingly damp, and produces (I believe by a kind of petrifaction from the water) a whiti&s;h kind of &s;tone, which they a&s;&s;ure us, when reduced to powder, is a &s;overeign remedy in many di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;aves the lives of thou&s;ands every year. There is not a hou&s;e in the i&s;land that is not provided with it: And they tell us there are many boxes of it &s;ent annually not only to Sicily and Italy, but likewi&s;e to the Levant and the Ea&s;t-Indies: And (what is con&s;idered as a daily &s;tanding miracle) notwith&s;tanding this perpetual con&s;umption, it has never been exhau&s;ted, nor even &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; the &s;aint always taking care to &s;upply them with a fre&s;h quantity the day following.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="024150_0190_0FC3C0EDEDFDA2C8">You may be &s;ure we did not fail to &s;tuff our pockets with this wonderful &s;tone; I &s;u&s;pected they would have prevented us, as I did not &s;uppo&s;e the &s;aint, would have worked for heretics: However, neither he nor the prie&s;ts had any objection, and we gave them a few Pauls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall &s;ilver coin.</NOTE> more for their civility. I ta&s;ted &s;ome of it, and believe it is a very harmle&s;s thing. It ta&s;tes like exceeding bad Magne&s;ia, and I believe has pretty much the &s;ame effects. They give about a tea-&s;poonful of it to children in the &s;mall-pox and in fevers. It pro|duces a copious &s;weat about an hour after, and, they &s;ay, never fails to be of &s;ervice. It is likewi&s;e e&s;teem|ed a certain remedy again&s;t the bite of all venomous animals. There is a very fine &s;tatue ot St. Paul in the middle of this grotto, to which they a&s;cribe great powers.</P>
<P>We were delighted, on our way back to the city, with the beauty of the &s;etting &s;un; much &s;uperior, I think, to what have ever ob&s;erved it in Italy. The whole of the ea&s;tern part or the heavens, for half an hour after &s;un-&s;et, was of a fine deep purple, and made a beautiful appearance: This the Malte&s;e tell us is generally the ca&s;e every evening, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>I forgot to &s;ay any thing of our pre&s;entation to the grand ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, for which I a&s;k pardon both of you and him. His name is Pinto, and of a Portugue&s;e family. He has now been at the head of this &s;ingular little &s;tate for upwards of thirty years. He received us with great politene&s;s, and was highly plea&s;ed to find that &s;ome of us had been in Portugal. He mentioned the intimate commercial connections that had &s;o long
<PB N="181" REF="024150_0191_0FC3C0EF5350FA10">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt our nations, and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of being of &s;ervice to us, and of rendering our &s;tay in his i&s;land as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. He is a clear-headed, &s;en&s;ible, little old man; which, at &s;o advanced a period of life, is very uncommon. Although he is con&s;ider|ably upwards of ninety, he retains all the faculties of his mind in perfection. He has no mini&s;ter, but manages every thing himself; and has immediate information of the mo&s;t minute occurrences. He walks up and down &s;tairs, and even to church, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and has the appearance as if he would &s;till live for many years. His hou&s;hold attendance and court are all very princely; and as grand ma&s;ter of Malta, he is more ab&s;olute, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more power, than mo&s;t &s;overeign princes. His titles are Serene Highne&s;s and Eminence; and as he has the di&s;po&s;al of all lucrative offices, he makes of his councils what he plea&s;es; be&s;ides, in all the councils that compo&s;e the juri&s;diction of this little nation, he him&s;elf pre&s;ides, and has two votes. Since he was cho&s;en grand ma&s;ter, he has already given away 126 commenderies, &s;ome of them worth upwards of 2000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year; be&s;ides priories and other offices of profit. He has the di&s;po&s;al of twenty-one commenderies and one priory every five years; and as there are always a number of expectants, he is very much courted.</P>
<P>He is cho&s;en by a committee of twenty-one; which committee is nominated by the &s;even nations, three out of each nation. The election mu&s;t be over within three days after the death of the former grand ma&s;ter; and during the&s;e three days, there is &s;carce a &s;oul that &s;leeps at Malta: All is cabal and intrigue; and mo&s;t of the knights are ma&s;ked, to prevent their particular attachments and connections from being known: The moment the election is over, every thing returns again to its former channel.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="024150_0192_0FC3C0F0DE2EC2C8">The land-force of Malta is equal to the number of men in the i&s;land fit to bear arms. They have about 500 regulars belonging to the &s;hips of war; and 150 compo&s;e the guard of the prince. The two i&s;lands of Malta and Gozzo contain about 150,000 inhabitants. The men are exceeding robu&s;t and hardy. I have &s;een them row for terror twelve hours without intermi&s;&s;ion, and without even appearing to be fatigued.</P>
<P>Their &s;ea force con&s;i&s;ts of four galleys, three galliots, four &s;hips of &s;ixty guns, and a frigate of thirty-&s;ix, be|&s;ides a number of the quick &s;ailing little ve&s;&s;els called Scampavias (literally, Runaways.) Their &s;hips, gal|leys, and fortifications, are not only well &s;upplied with excellent artillery, but they have likewi&s;e invented a kind of ordnance of their own, unknown to all the world be&s;ides. For we found, to our no &s;mall amazement, that the rocks were not only cut into fortifications, but likewi&s;e into artillery to defend the&s;e fortifications; being hollowed out in many places into the form of immen&s;e mortars. The charge is &s;aid to be about a a barrel of gunpowder, over which they place a large piece of wood, made exactly to fit the mouth of the chamber. On this they heap a great quantity of can|non balls, &s;hells, or other deadly materials; and when an enemy's &s;hip approaches the harbour, they fire the whole into the air; and they pretend it produces a very great effect, making a &s;hower for two or three hun|dred yards round, that would &s;ink any ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;uppo&s;ed bigotry of the Malte&s;e, the &s;pirit of toleration is &s;o &s;trong, that a mo&s;que, has lately been built for their &s;worn enemies the Turks. Here the poor &s;laves are allowed to enjoy their religion in peace. It happened lately that &s;ome idle boys di&s;turbed them during their &s;ervice; they were im|mediately

&s;ent to pri&s;on, and &s;everely puni&s;hed. The police indeed is much better regulated than in the neighbouring countries, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and robberies are very uncommon; the la&s;t of which crimes the grand ma&s;ter puni&s;hes with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. But he is &s;aid, perhaps in compliance with the prejudice of his nation, to be much more relax with regard to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps Malta is the only country in the world where duelling is permitted by law.&mdash;As their whole e&s;tabli&s;hment is originally founded on the wild and romantic principles of chivalry, they have ever found it too incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e principles to aboli&s;h duel|ling; but they have laid it under &s;uch re&s;trictions as greatly to le&s;&s;en its danger. The&s;e are curious enough. The duelli&s;ts are obliged to decide their quarrel in one particular &s;treet of the city; and if they pre&s;ume to fight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny where el&s;e, they are liable to the rigour of the law. But what is not le&s;s &s;ingular, and much more in their favour, they are obliged under the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties to put up their &s;word, when ordered &s;o to do, by a <HI>woman,</HI> a <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> or a <HI>knight.</HI></P>
<P>Under the&s;e limitations, in the mid&s;t of a great city, one would imagine it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that a duel could ever end in blood; however, this is not the ca&s;e. A cro&s;s is always painted on the wall oppo&s;ite to the &s;pot where a knight has been killed, in commemoration of his fall. We counted about twenty of the&s;e cro&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>About three months ago, two knights had a di&s;pute at a billiard table.&mdash;One of them, after giving a great deal of abu&s;ive language, added a blow; but to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Malta (in who&s;e annals there is not a &s;imilar in&s;tance) after &s;o great a provocation, he
<PB N="184" REF="024150_0194_0FC3C0F3A69931F0">
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to fight his antagoni&s;t. The chal|lenge was repeated, and he had time to reflect on the con&s;equences, but &s;till he refu&s;ed to enter the li&s;ts.&mdash; He was condemned to make <HI>amende honorable</HI> in the great church of St. John for forty-five days &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly; then to be confined in a dungeon without light for five years, after which he is to remain a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle for life. The unfortunate young man who received the blow is likewi&s;e in di&s;grace, as he has not had an opportunity of wiping it out in the blood of his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>This has been looked upon as a very &s;ingular affair, and is &s;till one of the principal topics of conver&s;ation. The fir&s;t part of the &s;entence has already been executed, and the poor wretch is now in his dungeon. Nor is it thought, that any abatement will be made in what remains.</P>
<P>If the legi&s;lature in other countries puni&s;hed with equal rigour tho&s;e that do fight, as it does in this tho&s;e that do not; I believe we &s;hould &s;oon have an end of dueling: But I &s;hould imagine the puni&s;hment for righting ought never to be a capital one, (but rather &s;omething ignominious;) and the puni&s;hment for not fighting &s;hould always be &s;o, or at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;evere corporal puni&s;hment; for ignominy will have as little effect on the per&s;on who is willing to &s;ubmit to the appellation of a coward, as the fear of death on one who makes it his glory to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P>The Malte&s;e &s;till talk with horror of a &s;torm that happened here on the 29th of October, 1757, of which as it was of a very &s;ingular nature, I &s;hall tran&s;late you &s;ome account from a little book they have given me, written on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="024150_0195_0FC3C0FCEC166468">About three quarters of an hour after midnight, there appeared to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the city a great black cloud, which, as it approached, changed its colour, 'till at la&s;t it became like a flame of fire mixed with black &s;moke. A dreadful noi&s;e was heard on its approach, that alarmed the whole city. It pa&s;&s;ed over part of the port, and came fir&s;t upon an Engli&s;h &s;hip, which in an in&s;tant was torn to pieces, and nothing left but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulk; part of the ma&s;ts, &s;ails, and cordage were carried along with the cloud to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The &s;mall boats and felloques that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in its way were all broken to pieces, and &s;unk. The noi&s;e increa&s;ed and became more frightful. A centi|nel, terrified at its approach, run into his box: Both he and it were lifted up and carried into the &s;ea, where he peri&s;hed. It then traver&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of the city, and laid in ruins almo&s;t every thing that &s;tood in its way. Several hou&s;es were laid level with the ground, and it did not leave one &s;teeple in its pa&s;&s;age. The b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls of &s;ome of them, together with the &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, were carried to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The roofs of the churches were demoli&s;hed and beat down, which, if it had happened in the day-time, mu&s;t have had dreadful con&s;equences, as all the world would imme|diately have run to the churches.</P>
<P>It went off at the north-ea&s;t point of the city; and demoli&s;hing the light-hou&s;e, is &s;aid to have mounted up into the air with a frightful noi&s;e; and pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ea to Sicily, where it tore up &s;ome trees, and did other damage, but nothing con&s;iderable; as its fury had been mo&s;tly &s;pent upon Malta, The number of killed and wounded amounted to near 200; and the lo&s;s of &s;hip|ping, hou&s;es, and churches, was very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Several treati&s;es have been written to account for
<PB N="186" REF="024150_0196_0FC3C0FE4B609130">
this &s;ingular hurricane, but I have found nothing at all &s;atisfactory. The &s;entiments of the people are conci&s;e and po&s;itive. They declare, with one voice that it was a legion of devils let loo&s;e to puni&s;h them for their &s;ins. There are a thou&s;and people in Malta that will take their oath they &s;aw them within the cloud, all as black as pitch, and breathing out fire and brim&s;tone. They add, that if there had not been a few godly per&s;ons among&s;t them, their whole city would certainly have been involved in one univer&s;al de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e-races of Malta are of a very uncommon kind. They are performed without either &s;addle, bridle, whip, or &s;pur; and yet the hor&s;es are &s;aid to run full &s;peed, and to afford a great deal of diver&s;ion. They are accu&s;tomed to the ground for &s;ome weeks before; and although it is entirely over rock and pave|ment, there are very &s;eldom any accidents. They have races of a&s;&s;es and mules performed in the &s;ame manner, four times every year. The rider is only furni&s;hed with a machine like a &s;hoe-maker's awl, to prick on his cour&s;er if he is lazy.</P>
<P>As Malta is an epitome of all Europe, and an a&s;&s;em|blage of the younger brothers, who are commonly the be&s;t, of its fir&s;t families, it is probably one of the be&s;t Academies for politene&s;s in this part of the globe; be&s;ides, where every one is intitled by law as well as cu&s;tom, to demand &s;atisfaction for the lea&s;t breach of it, people are under a nece&s;&s;ity of being very exact and circum&s;pect, both with regard to their words and actions.</P>
<P>All the knights and commanders have much the appearance of gentlemen, and men of the world. We met with no character in extreme. The ridicules and
<PB N="187" REF="024150_0197_0FC3C0FFE33BE9A8">
prejudices of every particular nation, are by degrees &s;oftened and wore off, by the familiar intercour&s;e and colli&s;ion with each other. It is curious to ob&s;erve the effect it produces upon the various people that compo&s;e this little medley. The French &s;kip, the German &s;trut, and the Spani&s;h &s;talk, are all mingled together in &s;uch &s;mall proportions, that none of them are &s;triking; yet every one of the&s;e nations &s;till retain &s;omething of their original characteri&s;tic: It is only the exuberance of it that is wore off; and it is &s;till ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the inhabitants of the &s;outh and north &s;ide of the Pyrenees, as well as tho&s;e of the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine; for though the Pari&s;ian has, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t his a&s;&s;uming air, the Spaniard his taci|turnity and &s;olemnity, the German his formality and his pride; yet &s;till you &s;ee the German, the Frenchman, and the Spaniard: It is only the caricature, that form|erly made them ridiculous, that has di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>This in&s;titution, which is a &s;trange compound of the military and eccle&s;ia&s;tic, has now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for near &s;even hundred years; and though, I believe, one of the fir&s;t-born, has long &s;urvived every other child of chivalry. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great riches in mo&s;t of the Catholic countries of Europe; and did &s;o in England too, before the time of Henry VIII. but that capricious tyrant did not chu&s;e that any in&s;titution, however ancient or re&s;pected, &s;hould remain in his dominions, that had any doubt of his &s;upremacy and infallibility; he therefore &s;eized on all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, at the &s;ame time that he enriched him&s;elf by the plund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the church.

<P>Malta, as well as Sicily, was long under the tyranny of the Saracens; from which they were both delivered about the middle of the eleventh century, by the valour of the Normans: After which time, the fate of Malta commonly depended on that of Sicily, 'till the emperor Charles V. about the year 1530, gave it, together with the i&s;land of Gozzo, to the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, who at that time had lo&s;t the i&s;land of Rhodes. In te&s;timony of this conce&s;&s;ion, the grand ma&s;ter is &s;till obliged, every year, to &s;end a falcon to the king of Sicily, or his viceroy; and on every new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to &s;wear allegiance, and to re|ceive, from the hands of the Sicilian monarch, the inve&s;titure of the&s;e two i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince our arrival here, the weather has been perfectly clear and &s;erene, without a cloud in the &s;ky; and for &s;ome time after &s;un-&s;et, the heavens exhibit a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, which I don't recollect to have ob&s;erved any where el&s;e. The ea&s;tern part of the hemi&s;phere appears of a rich deep purple, and the we&s;tern is the true yellow glow of Claud Lorrain, that you u&s;ed to admire &s;o much. The weather, however, is not intolerably hot; thermometer &s;tands commonly betwixt 75 and 76. Adieu.

<SALUTE>Dear Beckford,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE left the port of Malta in a &s;paronaro which we hired to convey us to this city.</P>
<P>We coa&s;ted along the i&s;land, and went to take a view of the north-port, its fortifications and lazaretto. All the&s;e are very great, and more like the works of a mighty and powerful people, than of &s;o &s;mall a &s;tate. The mortars cut out of the rock are a tremendous invention. There are about fifty of them, near the different creeks and landing places round the i&s;land. They are directed at the mo&s;t probable &s;pots where
<PB N="190" REF="024150_0200_0FC3D3FACDDE8D68">
boats would attempt a landing. The mouths of &s;ome of the&s;e mortars are about &s;ix feet wide, and they are &s;aid to throw a hundred cantars of cannon-ball or &s;tones. A cantar is, I think, about a hundred pound weight; &s;o that if they do take place, they mu&s;t make a dreadful havock among&s;t a debarkation of boats.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance of Malta from Gozzo is not above four or five miles, and the &s;mall i&s;land of Commino lies betwixt them. The coa&s;ts of all the three are bare and barren, but covered over with towers, redoubts, and fortifications of various kinds.</P>
<P>As Gozzo is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the celebrated i&s;land of Calyp&s;o, you may believe we expected &s;omething very fine; but we were di&s;appointed. It mu&s;t either be greatly fallen off &s;ince the time &s;he inhabited it, or the archbi&s;hop of Cambray, as well as Homer, mu&s;t have flattered greatly in their painting. We looked as we went along the coa&s;t, for the grotto of the godde&s;s, but could &s;ee nothing that re&s;embled it. Neither could we ob&s;erve tho&s;e verdant banks eternally covered with flowers; nor tho&s;e lofty trees for ever in blo&s;&s;om, that lo&s;t their heads in the clouds, and afforded a &s;hade to the &s;acred baths of her and her nymphs. We &s;aw, indeed, &s;ome nymphs; but as neither Calyp&s;o nor Eucharis &s;eemed to be of the number, we paid little attention to them, and I was in no apprehen&s;ion about my Telemachus: Indeed, it would have required an imagination as &s;trong as Don Quixote's, to have brought about the metamorpho&s;is.</P>
<P>Finding our hopes fru&s;trated, we ordered our &s;ailors to pull out to &s;ea, and bid adieu to the i&s;land of Calyp|&s;o, concluding, either that our intelligence was fal&s;e, or that both the i&s;land and its inhabitants were greatly
<PB N="191" REF="024150_0201_0FC3D3FC49E57668">
changed. We &s;oon found our&s;elves once more at the mercy of the waves: Night came on, and our rowers began their evening &s;ong to the Virgin, and beat time with their oars. Their offering was acceptable; for we had the mo&s;t delightful weather. We rapt our|&s;elves up in our cloaks, and &s;lept mo&s;t comfortably, having provided mattre&s;&s;es at Malta. By a little after day-break, we found we had got without &s;ight of all the i&s;lands, and &s;aw only a part of mount Aetna &s;moak|ing above the waters. The wind &s;prung up fair, and by ten o'clock we had &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Sicily.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering the &s;mallne&s;s of our boat, and the great breadth of this pa&s;&s;age, we could not help admi|ring the temerity of the&s;e people, who, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, venture to Sicily in the&s;e diminutive ve&s;&s;els; yet it is very &s;eldom that any accident happens; they are &s;o perfectly acquainted with the weather, foretelling, almo&s;t to a certainty, every &s;torm, many hours before it comes on. The &s;ailors look upon this pa&s;&s;age as one of the mo&s;t &s;tormy and dangerous in the Mediter|ranean. It is called the canal of Malta, and is much dreaded by the Levant &s;hips; but indeed, at this &s;ea&s;on, there is no danger.</P>
<P>We arrived at Sicily a little before &s;un-&s;et, and land|ed oppo&s;ite to Ragu&s;a, and not far from the ruins of the little Hybla; the third town of that name in the i&s;land, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithets of the Great (near mount Aetna) the Le&s;&s;er (near Augu&s;ta) and the Little (ju&s;t by Ragu&s;a.) Here we found a fine &s;andy beach, and whil&s;t the &s;ervants were employed in dre&s;|&s;ing &s;upper, we amu&s;ed our&s;elves with bathing and gathering &s;hells, of which there is a con&s;iderable va|riety. We were in expectation of finding the nautilus, for which this i&s;land is famous; but in this we did not
<PB N="192" REF="024150_0202_0FC3D3FE581CD618">
&s;ucceed. However, we picked up &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;hells, though not equal to tho&s;e that are brought from the Indies.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, we again launched our bark, and went to &s;ea. The wind was favourable as we could wi&s;h. We had our nightly &s;erenade as u&s;ual, and the next day, by twelve o'clock, we reached the celebrated port of Agrigentum.</P>
<P>The captain of the port gave us a polite reception, and in&s;i&s;ted on accompanying us to the city, which &s;tands near the top of a mountain, four miles di&s;tant from the harbour, and about eleven hundred feet above the level of the &s;ea. The road on each &s;ide is border|ed by a row of exceeding large American aloes; up|wards of one third of them being at pre&s;ent in full blow, and making the mo&s;t beautiful appearance that can be imagined. The flower-&s;tems of this noble plant are in general betwixt twenty and thirty feet high, (&s;ome of them more) and are covered with flowers from top to bottom; which taper regularly, and form a beautiful kind of pyramid, the ba&s;e or pede&s;tal of which is the fine &s;preading leaves of the plant. As this is e&s;teemed in northern countries, one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities of the vegetable tribe, we were happy at &s;eeing it in &s;o great perfection; much greater, I think, than I had ever &s;een it before.</P>
<P>With us, I think, it is vulgarly reckoned, (though I believe fal&s;ely) that they only flower once in a hun|dred years. Here I was informed, that, at the late&s;t, they always blow the &s;ixth year; but for the mo&s;t part the fifth. As the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the plant is car|ried into the &s;tem and the flowers, the leaves begin to decay as &s;oon as the blow is completed, and a numer|ous
<PB N="193" REF="024150_0203_0FC3D403CCEBFBC0">
offspring of young plants are produced round the root of the old one; the&s;e are &s;lipped off, and formed into new plantations, either for hedges or for avenues to their country-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The city of Agrigentum, now called <HI>Girgenti,</HI> is irregular and ugly; though from a few miles di&s;tance at &s;ea, it makes a noble appearance, little inferior to that of Genoa.&mdash;As it lies on the &s;lope of the moun|tain, the hou&s;es do not hide one another; but every part of the city is &s;een.</P>
<P>On our arrival, we found a great falling off indeed; the hou&s;es are mean, the &s;treets dirty, crooked, and narrow. It &s;till contains near twenty thou&s;and people; a &s;ad reduction from its ancient grandeur, when it was &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of no le&s;s than eight hundred thou&s;and, being the next city to Syracu&s;e for numbers.</P>
<P>The Canonico Spoto, from Mr. Hamilton's letter, and from our former acquaintance with him at Naples, gave us a kind, and a ho&s;pitable reception. He in&s;i&s;ted on our being his gue&s;ts; and we are now in his hou&s;e, comfortably lodged, and elegantly entertained, which, after our crowded little apartment in the &s;paronaro, is by no means a di&s;agreeable change. Farewell. I &s;hall write to you again &s;oon.</P>

<P>WE are ju&s;t now returned from examining the antiquities of Agrigentum, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, perhaps, of any in Sicily.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="024150_0204_0FC3D4091D078C90">The ruins of the ancient city lie about a &s;hort mile from the modern one. The&s;e, like the ruins of Syra|cu&s;e, are mo&s;tly converted into corn-fields, vineyards, and orchards; but the remains of the temples here, are much more con&s;picuous than tho&s;e of Syracu&s;e. Four of the&s;e have &s;tood pretty much in a right line, near the &s;outh wall of the city. The fir&s;t they call the temple of Venus; almo&s;t one half of which &s;till re|mains. The &s;econd is that of Concord: It may be con&s;idered as entire, not one column having as yet fallen. It is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions and &s;ame architecture as that of Venus, which had probably &s;erv|ed as the model for it. By the following in&s;cription, found on a large piece of marble, it appears to have been built at the expen&s;e of the Lilibitani; probably after having been defeated by the people of Agrigentum.</P>
<P>CONCORDIAE AGRIGENTINORUM SACRUM, RESPUBLICA LILIBITANORUM, DEDICANTIBUS M. ATTERIO CANDIDO PROCOS. ET L. CORNELIO MAR. CELLO. Q. P. R. P. R.</P>
<P>The&s;e temples are &s;upported by thirteen large fluted Doric columns on each &s;ide; and &s;ix at each end. All their ba&s;es, capitals, entablatures, &amp;c. &s;till remain entire; and as the architecture is perfectly &s;imple, without any thing affected or &s;tudied, the whole &s;trikes the eye at once, and plea&s;es very much. The columns are, indeed, &s;horter than the common Doric propor|tions; and they certainly are not &s;o elegant as &s;ome of the ancient temples near Rome, and in other places in Italy.</P>
<P>The third temple is that of Hercules, altogether in ruins; but appears to have been of a much greater &s;ize
<PB N="195" REF="024150_0205_0FC3D40A89591100">
than the former two. We mea&s;ured &s;ome of the bro|ken columns, near &s;even feet in diameter. It was here that the famous &s;tatue of Hercules &s;tood, &s;o much celebrated by Cicero; which the people of Agrigen|tum defended with &s;uch bravery, again&s;t Verres, who attempted to &s;eize it. You will find the whole &s;tory in his pleadings again&s;t that infamous praetor.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e in this temple a famous picture by Zeuxis. Hercules was repre&s;ented in his cradle killing the two &s;erpents: Alcmena and Amphitrion having ju&s;t entered the apartment, were painted with every mark of terror and a&s;toni&s;hment. Pliny &s;ays, the painter looked upon this piece as invaluable; and therefore could never be prevailed on to put a price upon it, but gave it as a pre&s;ent to Agrigentum, to be placed in the temple of Hercules. The&s;e two great ma&s;ter-pieces have been lo&s;t. We thought of them with regret, whil&s;t we trod on the&s;e venerable ruins.</P>
<P>Near to this lie the ruins of the temple of Jupiter Olympus, &s;uppo&s;ed by the Sicilian authors to have been the large&s;t in the heathen world. It is now called <HI>il tempio de' giganti,</HI> or the Giants Temple, as the people cannot conceive that &s;uch ma&s;&s;es of rock could ever be put together by the hands of ordinary men. The fragments of columns are indeed enor|mous, and give us a va&s;t idea of this fabric. It is &s;aid to have &s;tood 'till the year 1100; but it is now a perfect ruin. Our Cicerones a&s;&s;ured us, it was exactly the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with the church of St. Peter at Rome: But in this they are egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. St. Peter's being much greater than any thing that ever the hea|then world produced.</P>
<P>There are the remains of many more temples, and other great works; but the&s;e, I think, are the more con&s;picu|ous.
<PB N="196" REF="024150_0206_0FC3D40C15A85F60">
They &s;hew you that of Vulcan, of Pro&s;erpine, of Ca&s;tor and Pollux, and a very remarkable one of Juno. This too was enriched by one of the mo&s;t famous pictures of antiquity; which is celebrated by many of the ancient writers. Zeuxis was determined to excel every thing that had gone before him, and to form a model of human perfection. To this end he pre|vailed on all the fine&s;t women of Agrigentum, who were even ambitious of the honour, to appear naked before him. Of the&s;e he cho&s;e five for his models, and mould|ing all the perfections of the&s;e beauties into one, he compo&s;ed the picture of the godde&s;s. This was ever looked upon as his ma&s;ter-piece; but was unfortu|nately burnt when the Carthagenians took Agrigen|tum. Many of the citizens retired into this temple as to a place of &s;afety; but as &s;oon as they found the gates attacked by the enemy, they agreed to &s;et fire to it, and cho&s;e rather to peri&s;h in the flames, than &s;ub|mit to the power of the conquerors. However, nei|ther the de&s;truction of the temple, nor the lo&s;s of their lives, has been &s;o much regretted by po&s;terity, as the lo&s;s of this picture.</P>
<P>The temple of Ae&s;culapius (the ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een) was not le&s;s celebrated for a &s;tatue of Apollo. It was taken from them by the Carthageni|ans, at the &s;ame time that the temple of Juno was burnt. It was carried off by the conquerors, and continued the greate&s;t ornament of Carthage for many years, and was at la&s;t re&s;tored by Scipio, at the final de&s;truction of that city. Some of the Sicilians alledge, I believe without any ground, that it was afterwards carried to Rome, and &s;till remains there, the wonder of all ages; known to the whole world under the name of the Apollo of Belvidere; and allowed to be the perfection of human art.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="024150_0207_0FC3D40D888E3750">I &s;hould be very tedious, were I to give you a minute de&s;cription of every piece of antiquity. In|deed, little or nothing is to be learned from the greate&s;t part of them. The ancient walls of the city are mo&s;tly cut out of the rock; the catacombs and &s;epulchres are all very great: One of the&s;e is worthy of particular notice, becau&s;e it is mentioned by Polybius, as being oppo&s;ite to the temple of Hercules, and to have been &s;truck by lightning even in his time. It remains almo&s;t entire, and an&s;wers the de&s;cription he gives of it: The in&s;criptions are &s;o defaced, that we could make nothing of them.</P>
<P>This is the monument of Tero king of Agrigent|um, one of the fir&s;t of the Sicilian tyrants. The great antiquity of it may be gathered from this, that Tero is not only mentioned by Diodorus, Polybius, and the later of the ancient hi&s;torians; but likewi&s;e by Herodo|tus, and Pindar, who dedicates two of his Olympic odes to him: So that this monument mu&s;t be more than two thou&s;and years old. It is a kind of pyramid, probably one of the mo&s;t durable forms.</P>
<P>All the&s;e mighty ruins of Agrigentum, and the whole mountain on which it &s;tands, are compo&s;ed of a concretion of &s;ea &s;hells, run together, and cemented by a kind of &s;and or gravel, and now become as hard, and perhaps more durable than even marble it&s;elf. This &s;tone is white before it has been expo&s;ed to the air; but in the temples and other ruins, it is become of a dark brown. I &s;hall bring home &s;ome pieces of it for the in&s;pection of the curious. I found the&s;e &s;hells on the very &s;ummit of the mountain, at lea&s;t fourteen or fifteen hundred feet above the level of the &s;ea. They are of the commone&s;t kinds, cockles, mu&s;cles, oy&s;ters, &amp;c.</P>

<P>By what means they have been lifted up to this va&s;t height, and &s;o intimately mixed with the &s;ub&s;tance of the rock, I leave to you and your philo&s;ophical friend to determine. This old battered globe of ours has probably &s;uffered many convul&s;ions not recorded in any hi&s;tory. You have heard of the va&s;t Stratum of bones lately di&s;covered in I&s;tria and O&s;&s;ero; part of it runs below rocks of marble, upwards of forty feet in thick|ne&s;s, and they have not yet been able to a&s;certain its extent: Something of the &s;ame kind has been found in Dalmatia, in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago; and, lately, I am told, in the rock of Gibraltar. Now, the deluge recorded in Scripture, will hardly account for all the appearances of this &s;ort to be met with, almo&s;t in every country in the world. But I am interrupted by vi&s;itors; which is a lucky circum&s;tance, both for you and me; for I was ju&s;t going to be very philo&s;o|phical, and con&s;equently very dull. Adieu.</P>

<P>THE interruption in my la&s;t, was a deputation from the bi&s;hop, to invite us to a great dinner to-mor|row at the port; &s;o that we &s;hall know whether this place &s;till de&s;erves the character of luxury, it always held among&s;t the ancients: We have great rea&s;on to think, from the politene&s;s and attention we have met
<PB N="199" REF="024150_0209_0FC3D4139295ACD8">
with, that it has never lo&s;t its ancient ho&s;pitality, for which it was likewi&s;e &s;o much celebrated.</P>
<P>Plato, when he vi&s;ited Sicily, was &s;o much &s;truck with the luxury of Agrigentum, both in their hou&s;es and their tables, that a &s;aying of his is &s;till recorded: that they built as if they were never to die, and eat as if they had not an hour to live. It is pre&s;erved by Aelian, and is ju&s;t now before me.</P>
<P>He tells a &s;tory by way of illu&s;tration, which &s;hews a much greater conformity of manners than one could have expected, betwixt the young nobility among&s;t the antients, and our own at this day.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, that after a great fea&s;t, where there was a number of young people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, they got all &s;o much intoxicated, that from their reeling and tumbling upon one another, they imagined they were at &s;ea in a &s;torm, and began to think them&s;elves in the mo&s;t imminent danger; at la&s;t they agreed, that the only way to &s;ave their lives was to lighten the &s;hip and with one accord began to throw the rich furni|ture out of the windows, to the great edification of the mob below; and did not &s;top 'till they had entirely cleared the hou&s;e of it, which, from this exploit, was ever after denominated the <HI>triremes,</HI> or the &s;hip. He &s;ays it was one of the principal palaces of the city, and retained this name for ever after. In Dublin, I have been told, there are more than one triremes; and that this frolic, which they call throwing the hou&s;e out of the window, is by no means uncommon.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that Agrigentum is abu&s;ed by the ancient authors for its drunkenne&s;s, it is as much cel|ebrated for its ho&s;pitality; and I believe, it will be
<PB N="200" REF="024150_0210_0FC3D41510C42128">
found, that this virtue, and this vice, have ever had a &s;ort of &s;neaking kindne&s;s for each other, and have gen|erally gone hand in hand, both in ancient and in mod|ern times. The Swi&s;s, the Scotch, and the Iri&s;h, who are at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t drunken people in Europe, are likewi&s;e, in all probability, the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable; whereas, in the very &s;ober countries, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, ho&s;pitality is a virtue very little known, or indeed any other virtue, except &s;obriety; which has been produced, probably a good deal from the tyranny of their government, and their dread of the inqui&s;ition; for where every per&s;on is in fear, le&s;t his real &s;enti|ments &s;hould appear, it would be very dangerous to unlock his heart; but in countries where there are nei|ther civil nor eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyrants to lay an embargo on our thoughts, people are under no apprehen&s;ion le&s;t they &s;hould be known.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e are not the only rea&s;ons. The mor|al virtues and vices may &s;ometimes depend on natural cau&s;es. The very elevated &s;ituation of this city, where the air is exceedingly thin and cold, has perhaps been one rea&s;on why its inhabitants are &s;onder of wine than their neighbours in the vallies.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the three nations I have mentioned; the greate&s;t part of their countries lying among&s;t hills and mountains, where the climate renders &s;trong liquors more nece&s;&s;ary; or, at lea&s;t, le&s;s perni|cious, than in low places. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that this practice, probably begun among&s;t the mountains, where the air is &s;o keen, has by degrees crept down into the vallies, and has at la&s;t become almo&s;t epidem|ical in tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>Fazzello, after railing at Agrigentum for its drunk|enne&s;s, adds, that there was no town in the i&s;land &s;o
<PB N="201" REF="024150_0211_0FC3D416A9FE07D0">
celebrated for its ho&s;pitality. He &s;ays that many of the nobles had &s;ervants placed at the gates of the city, to invite all &s;trangers to their hou&s;es. It is in refer|ence to this probably, that Empedocles &s;ays, that even the gates of the city proclaimed a welcome to every &s;tranger. From our experience we are well entitled to &s;ay, that the people of Agrigentum &s;till retain this antiquated virtue, &s;o little known in polite countries. To-morrow we &s;hall have a better opportunity of judging whether it is &s;till accompanied by its &s;i&s;ter vice.</P>
<P>The accounts that the old authors give of the mag|nificence of Agrigentum are amazing; though indeed there are none of them that proclaim it in &s;tronger terms than the monuments that &s;till remain. Diodo|rus &s;ays, the great ve&s;&s;els for holding water were com|monly of &s;ilver, and the litters and carriages for the mo&s;t part were of ivory richly adorned. He mentions a pond made at an immen&s;e expence, full of fi&s;h and of water-fowl, that in his time was the great re&s;ort of the inhabitants, on their fe&s;tivals; but he &s;ays, that even then (in the age of Augu&s;tus) it was going to ruin, requiring too great an expence to keep it up. There is not now the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of it: But there is &s;till to be &s;een a curious &s;pring of water that throws up a kind of oil on its &s;urface, which is made u&s;e of by the poor people in many di&s;ea&s;es. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to mark out the place of the celebrated pond; which is recorded by Pliny and Solinus to have abounded with this oil.</P>
<P>Diodorus, &s;peaking of the riches of Agrigentum, mentions one of its citizens returning victorious from the Olympic games, and entering his city, attended by three hundred chariots, each drawn by four white hor&s;es, richly capari&s;oned; and gives many other in&s;tances of their va&s;t profu&s;ion and luxury.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="024150_0212_0FC3D41BC0D4A198">Tho&s;e hor&s;es, according to that author, were e&s;teem|ed all over Greece, for their beauty and &s;wiftne&s;s; and their race is celebrated by many of the ancient writers.
<Q><L>"Ardous inde Agragas o&s;tentat maxima longe</L>
<L>"Moenia, magnanimum quondam generator equorum,"</L></Q>
&s;ays Virgil in the third Aeneid; and Pliny acquaints us, that tho&s;e which had been often victorious at the games were not only honoured with burial rites, but had magnificent monuments erected to eternize their memory. This Time us confirms: He tells us, that he &s;aw at Agrigentum &s;everal pyramids built as &s;epul|chral monuments to celebrated hor&s;es; he adds, that when tho&s;e animals became old and unfit for &s;ervice, they were always taken care of, and &s;pent the remain|der of their lives in ea&s;e and plenty. I could wi&s;h that our countrymen would imitate the gratitude and hu|manity of the Sicilians in this article; at lea&s;t, the lat|ter part of it. I don't know that our nation can &s;o ju&s;tly be taxed with cruelty or ingratitude in any other article as in their treatment of hor&s;es, the animal that of all others is the mo&s;t entitled to our care. How piteous a thing it is, on many of your great roads, to &s;ee the fine&s;t old hunters, that were once the glory of the chace, condemned, in the decline of life, to the ty|ranny of the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;&s;ors; in who&s;e hands they &s;uffer the mo&s;t extreme mi&s;ery, 'till they at la&s;t &s;ink under the ta&s;k that is a&s;&s;igned them. I am called away to &s;ee &s;ome more antiques, but &s;hall fini&s;h this letter to night, as the po&s;t goes off for Italy to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>13th; Afternoon. We have &s;een a great many old walls and vaults that little or nothing can be made of. They give them names, and pretend to tell you
<PB N="203" REF="024150_0213_0FC3D41D39929620">
what they were, but as they bear no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e things now, it would be no le&s;s idle to trouble you with their non&s;en&s;e than to believe it. We have indeed &s;een one thing that has amply repaid us for the trouble we have taken. It is the repre&s;entation of a boar-hunting in alto relievo, on white marble; and is at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;uperior, to any thing of the kind I have ever met with in Italy. It con&s;i&s;ts of four dif|ferent parts; which form the the hi&s;tory of this remark|able chace and its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the preparation for the hunt. There are twelve hunters, with each his lance, and a &s;hort hanger under his left arm of a very &s;ingular form. The dogs re&s;emble tho&s;e we call lurchers. The hor&s;es are done with great fire and &s;pirit, and are per|haps a better proof of the excellence of the race, than even the te&s;timony of their authors; for the arti&s;t that formed the&s;e mu&s;t certainly have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee very fine hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;econd piece repre&s;ents the chace. The third, the death of the king, by a fall from his hor&s;e. And the fourth, the de&s;pair of the queen and her attendants, on receiving the news. She is repre&s;ented as falling down in a &s;woon, and &s;upported by her women, who are all in tears.</P>
<P>It is executed in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;tile, and is in|deed one of the fine&s;t remains of antiquity. It is pre|&s;erved in the great church, which is noted through all Sicily for a remarkable echo; &s;omething in the man|ner of our whi&s;pering gallery at St. Paul's though more difficult to be accounted for.</P>
<P>If one per&s;on &s;tands at the we&s;t gate, and another places him&s;elf on the cornice, at the mo&s;t di&s;tant point
<PB N="204" REF="024150_0214_0FC3D41EC49829A8">
of the church, exactly behind the great altar, they can hold a conver&s;ation in very low whi&s;pers.</P>
<P>For many years this &s;ingularity was little known; and &s;everal of the confe&s;&s;ing chairs being placed near the great altar, the wags, who were in the &s;ecret, u&s;ed to take their &s;tation at the door of the cathedral; and by this means heard di&s;tinctly every word that pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the confe&s;&s;or and his penitent; of which, you may believe, they did not fail to make their own u&s;e when occa&s;ion offered. The mo&s;t &s;ecret intrigues were di&s;covered; and every woman in Agrigentum changed either her gallant, or her confe&s;&s;or. Yet &s;till it was the &s;ame. At la&s;t, however, the cau&s;e was found out; the chairs were removed, and other precau|tions were taken, to prevent the di&s;covery of the&s;e &s;a|cred my&s;teries, and a mutual amne&s;ty pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t all the offended parties.</P>
<P>Agrigentum, like Syracu&s;e, was long &s;ubject to the yoke of tyrants. Fazzello gives &s;ome account of their cruelty, but I have no intention of repeating it: One &s;tory, however, plea&s;ed me; it is a well known one, but as it is &s;hort, you &s;hall have it.</P>
<P>Perillo, a gold&s;mith, by way of paying court to Phalaris the tyrant, made him a pre&s;ent of a brazen bull, of admirable workman&s;hip; hollow within, and &s;o contrived that the voice of a per&s;on &s;hut up in it, &s;ounded exactly like the bellowing of a real bull. The arti&s;t pointed out to the tyrant what an admirable effect this mu&s;t produce, were he only to &s;hut up a few criminals in it, and make a fire under them.</P>
<P>Phalaris, &s;truck with &s;o horrid an idea, and perhaps curious to try the experiment, told the gold&s;mith that

he him&s;elf was the only per&s;on worthy of animating his bull: that he mu&s;t have &s;tudied the note that made it roar to the greate&s;t advantage, and that it would be unju&s;t to deprive him of any part of the honour of his invention. Upon which he ordered the gold&s;mith to be &s;hut up, and made a great fire around the bull; which immediately began to roar, to the admiration and delight of all Agrigentum. Cicero &s;ays this bull was carried to Carthage at the taking of Agrigentum; and was re&s;tored again by Scipio, after the de&s;truction of that city.</P>
<P>Fazzello adds another story, which is &s;till more to the honour of Phalaris. Two friends, Melanippus and Cariton, had con&s;pired his death. Cariton, in hopes of &s;aving his friend from the danger of the enter|pri&s;e, determined to execute it alone. However&punc; in his attempt to poignard the tyrant, he was &s;eized by the guards, and immediately put to the torture, to make him confe&s;s his accomplice; this he bore with the utmo&s;t fortitude, refu&s;ing to make the di&s;covery; 'till Melanippus, informed of the &s;ituation of his friend, ran to the tyrant, a&s;&s;uring him that he alone was the guilty per&s;on; that it was entirely by his in&s;tigation that Cariton had acted; and begged that he might be put on the rack in the place of his friend. Phalaris, &s;truck with &s;uch heroi&s;m, pardoned them both.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this generous action, he was in many re&s;pects a barbarous tyrant. Fezzello gives the following account of his death, with which I &s;hall conclude this letter, for I am mon&s;trou&s;ly tired, and I dare &s;ay, &s;o are you. Zeno, the philo&s;opher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Agrigentum, and being admitted into the pre&s;ence of the tyrant, advi&s;ed him, for his own comfort, as well as that of his &s;ubject to re&s;ign his power, and to lead a
<PB N="206" REF="024150_0216_0FC3D4257767EA08">
private life. Phalaris did not reli&s;h the&s;e philo&s;ophical &s;entiments; and &s;u&s;pecting Zeno to be in a con&s;piracy with &s;ome of his &s;ubjects, ordered him to be put to the torture in pre&s;ence of the citizens of Agrigentum.</P>
<P>Zeno immediately began to reproach them with cowardice and pu&s;illanimity in &s;ubmitting tamely to the yoke of &s;o worthle&s;s a tyrant; and in a &s;hort time rai&s;ed &s;uch a flame that they defeated the guards, and &s;toned Phalaris to death. I dare &s;ay you are glad they did it &s;o quickly. Well, I &s;hall not write &s;uch long letters for the future; for I a&s;&s;ure you it is at lea&s;t as trouble&s;ome to the writer as the reader. Adieu. We &s;hall &s;ail to-morrow or next morning for Trapani, from whence you may expect to hear from me. We are now going out to examine more antique walls, but I &s;hall not trouble you with them.</P>

<P>WHEN I have nothing el&s;e to do, I generally take up the pen. We are now on the top of a high mountain, about half way betwixt Agrigentum and Palermo. Our &s;ea expedition by Trapani has failed, and we are determined to put no more confidence in that element, happy beyond mea&s;ure to find our&s;elves at a di&s;tance from it, though in the mo&s;t wretched of villages. We have travelled all night on mules; and arrived here about ten o'clock, overcome with &s;leep
<PB N="207" REF="024150_0217_0FC3D42922291E00">
and fatigue. We have ju&s;t had an excellent di&s;h of tea, which never fails to cure me of both; and I am now as fre&s;h as when we &s;et out. It has not had the &s;ame effect on my companions: they have thrown them&s;elves down on a vile &s;traw-bed in the corner of the hovel; and in &s;pite of a parcel of &s;tarved chickens, that are fluttering about and picking the &s;traws all round them, they are already fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;eize that time to recapitulate what has hap|pened &s;ince my la&s;t.</P>
<P>The day after I wrote to you, we made &s;ome little ex|cur&s;ions round Agrigentum. The country is delight|ful, producing corn, wine, and oil, in the greate&s;t abun|dance: The fields are, at the &s;ame time, covered with a variety of the fine&s;t fruits; oranges, lemons pomegran|ates, almonds, pi&s;tachio-nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e afforded us almo&s;t as agreeable an entertainment as the con&s;ider|ation of the ruins from whence they &s;pring.</P>
<P>We dined with the bi&s;hop, according to agreement, and ro&s;e from table, convinced that the ancient Agri|gentini could not po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand the true luxury of eating, better than their de&s;cendants, to whom they have tran&s;mitted a very competent portion both of their &s;ocial virtues and vices. I beg their pardon for calling them vices, I wi&s;h I had a &s;ofter name for it; it looks like ingratitude for their ho&s;pitality, for which we owe them &s;o much.</P>
<P>We were ju&s;t thirty at table, but, upon my word, I do not think we had le&s;s than an hundred di&s;hes of meat. The&s;e were dre&s;&s;ed with the riche&s;t and mo&s;t delicate &s;auces; and convinced us that the old Roman proverb of "Siculus coquus et Sicula men&s;a," was not more
<PB N="208" REF="024150_0218_0FC3D429EC6CBDE0">
applicable in their time, than it is at pre&s;ent. Nothing was wanting that could be invented to &s;timulate and to flatter the palate; and to create a fal&s;e appetite as well as to &s;atisfy it. Some of the very di&s;hes &s;o much rel|i&s;hed by the Roman epicures made a part of the fea&s;t; particularly the morene, which is &s;o often mentioned by their authors: It is a &s;pecies of eel, found only in this part of the Mediterranean, and &s;ent from hence to &s;everal of the courts of Europe. It is not &s;o fat and lu&s;cious as other eels, &s;o that you can eat a good deal more of it: Its fle&s;h is as white as &s;now, and is indeed a very great delicacy. But a modern refinement in luxury has, I think, &s;till produced a greater: By a particular kind of management they make the livers of their fowls grow to a large &s;ize, and at the &s;ame time acquire a high and rich flavour. It is indeed a mo&s;t incom|parable di&s;h; but the means of procuring it is &s;o cruel, that I will not even tru&s;t it with you. Perhaps, with|out any bad intention, you might mention it to &s;ome of your friends, they to others, 'till at la&s;t it might come into the hands of tho&s;e that would be glad to try the experiment; and the whole race of poultry might ever have rea&s;on to cur&s;e me: let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that it occa&s;ions a painful and lingering death to the poor ani|mal: that I know is enough to make you wi&s;h never to ta&s;te of it, whatever effect it may have upon others.</P>
<P>The Sicilians eat of every thing, and attempted to make us do the &s;ame. The company was remarkably merry, and did by no means belie their ancient cha|racter, for mo&s;t of them were more than half &s;eas over, long before we ro&s;e from table; and I was &s;omewhat apprehen&s;ive of a &s;econd edition of the Triremes &s;cene, as they were beginning to reel exceedingly. By the bye, I do not doubt but that phra&s;e of <HI>half &s;eas over,</HI> may have taken its origin from &s;ome &s;uch &s;tory. They
<PB N="209" REF="024150_0219_0FC3D432E9A97378">
begged us to make a bowl of punch, a liquor they had often heard of, but had never &s;een. The materials were immediately found, and we &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that they preferred it to all the wines on the table, of which they had a great variety. We were obliged to replen|i&s;h the bowl &s;o often, that I really expected to &s;ee mo&s;t of them under the table. They called it Pontio, and &s;poke loudly in its prai&s;e; declaring that Pontio (alluding to Pontius Pilate) was a much better fellow than they had ever taken him for. However, after dinner, one of them, a reverend canon, grew exce&s;&s;ive|ly &s;ick, and while he was throwing up, he turned to me with a rueful countenance, and &s;haking his head, he groaned out, "Ah, Signor Capitano, &s;apeva &s;em|pre che Pontio era un grande traditore." "I always knew that Pontius was a great traitor." Another of them overhearing him, exclaimed, "A&s;pettatevi Signor Canonico."&mdash;"Not &s;o fa&s;t (&s;aid he) my good Canon." "Niente al pregiudizio di Signor Pontio, vi prego&punc; Recordate, che Pontio v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha fatto un canonico; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pon|tio ha fatto &s;ua eccellenza uno Ve&s;covo; Non &s;corda|tevi mai di vo&s;tri amici."</P>
<P>Now what do you think of the&s;e reverend fathers of the church? Their merit, you will ea&s;ily perceive, does not con&s;i&s;t in fa&s;ting and prayer. Their creed, they &s;ay, they have a good deal modernized, and is much &s;impler than that of Athana&s;ius. One of them told me, that if we would but &s;tay with them for &s;ome little time, we &s;hould &s;oon be convinced that they were the happiest fellows on earth. "We have exploded (&s;aid he) from our &s;y&s;tem every thing that is di&s;mal or melancholy&punc; and are per&s;uaded, that of all the roads in the univer&s;e, the road to heaven mu&s;t be the plea&s;ante&s;t and lea&s;t gloomy: If it be not &s;o, (added he) God have mercy upon us, for I am afraid we &s;hall never get there." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="210" REF="024150_0220_0FC3D433BB2AD1F0">
told him I could not flatter him; "That if laughing was really a &s;in, as &s;ome people taught, they were certainly the greate&s;t of all &s;inners," " Well (&s;aid he) we &s;hall at lea&s;t endeavour to be happy here; and that, I am per&s;uaded, is the be&s;t of all preparations for happi|ne&s;s hereafter. Ab&s;tinence (continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) from all innocent and lawful plea&s;ures, we reckon one of the greate&s;t &s;ins, and guard again&s;t it with the utmo&s;t care: and I am pretty &s;ure it is a &s;in that none of us here will ever be damned for." He concluded by repeating two lines, which he told me was their favourite maxim: The meaning of which was exactly tho&s;e of Mr. Pope,
<Q><L>"For God is paid when man receives,</L>
<L>"To enjoy is to obey."</L></Q></P>
<P>This is not the fir&s;t time I have met with this liber|tine &s;pirit among&s;t the Roman Catholic clergy. There is &s;o much non&s;en&s;e and mummery in their wor&s;hip, that they are afraid le&s;t &s;trangers &s;hould believe they are &s;erious; and perhaps too often fly to the oppo&s;ite ex|treme.</P>
<P>We were, however, much plea&s;ed with the bi&s;hop; he is greatly and de&s;ervedly re&s;pected, yet his pre&s;ence did no wi&s;e dimini&s;h, but rather increa&s;ed, the jollity of the company. He entered into every joke, joined in the repartee, at which he is a great proficient, and entirely laid a&s;ide his epi&s;copal dignity; which, however, I am told, he knows very well how to a&s;&s;ume when it is nece&s;&s;ary. He placed us next to him&s;elf, and behaved indeed, in every re&s;pect, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and politene&s;s. He is of one of the fir&s;t families of the i&s;land, and brother to the Prince of&mdash;. I had his whole pedigree pat, but now I have lo&s;t it; no matter: He is an hone&s;t, plea&s;ant, little fellow, and that is of much
<PB N="211" REF="024150_0221_0FC3D4358566C830">
more con&s;equence. He is not yet forty; and &s;o high a promotion in &s;o early a period of life, is reckoned very extraordinary, this being the riche&s;t bi&s;hopric in the kingdom. He is a good &s;cholar, and very deeply read, both in ancient and modern learning; and his genius is in no degree inferior to his erudition. The &s;imilar|ity of character and circum&s;tances &s;truck me &s;o &s;trongly, that I could &s;carce help thinking I had got be&s;ide our worthy and re&s;pectable friend, the b&mdash;p of D&mdash;y, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;till added greatly to the plea&s;ure I had in his company. I told the bi&s;hop of this; adding that he was brother to I&mdash;d B&mdash;I: he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, he had often heard of the family, both when lord B&mdash; was amba&s;&s;ador in Spain, and his other brother commander in the Medi|terranean.</P>
<P>We found in this company a number of Free Ma&s;ons, who were delighted beyond mea&s;ure, when they di&s;covered that we were their brethren. They pre&s;&s;ed us to &s;pend a few more days among&s;t them, and offered us letters to Palermo, and every other town we &s;hould think of vi&s;iting; but the heats are increasing &s;o violently, that we were afraid of prolonging our expe|dition, le&s;t we &s;hould be caught by the &s;irocc winds, &s;uppo&s;ed to blow from the burning de&s;arts of Africa, and &s;ometimes attended with dangerous con&s;equences to tho&s;e that travel over Sicily.</P>
<P>But I find I have omitted &s;everal circum&s;tances of our dinner. I &s;hould have told you, that it was an annual fea&s;t given by the nobility of Agrigentum to the bi&s;hop. It was &s;erved in an immen&s;e granary, half full of wheat, on the &s;ea &s;hore, cho&s;en on purpo&s;e to avoid the heat. The whole was on plate; and what appeared &s;ingular to us, but I believe is a much better

method than ours; great part of the fruit was &s;erved up with the &s;econd cour&s;e, the fir&s;t di&s;h of which that went round was &s;trawberries. The Sicilians were a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us eat them with cream &amp; &s;ugar, yet upon trial they did not at all di&s;like the compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The de&s;ert con&s;i&s;ted of a great variety of fruits, and &s;till a greater of ices; the&s;e were &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed in the &s;hapes of peaches, figs, oranges, nuts, &amp;c. that a per|&s;on unaccu&s;tomed to ices might very ea&s;ily have been taken in, as an hone&s;t &s;ea officer was lately at the hou&s;e of a certain mini&s;ter of your acquaintance, not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for the elegance of his table, than the exact formality and &s;ubordination to be ob&s;erved at it. After the &s;econd cour&s;e was removed; and the ices, in the &s;hape of various fruits and &s;weetmeats, advanced by way of rear-guard; one of the &s;ervants carried the figure of a fine large peach to the captain, who, unac|quainted with deceit of any kind, never doubted that it was a real one; and cutting it through the middle, in a moment he had one large half of it in his mouth; at fir&s;t he only looked grave, and blew up his cheeks to give it more room; but the violence of the cold &s;oon getting the better of his patience, he began to tumble it about from &s;ide to &s;ide in his mouth, his eyes ru&s;hing out of water, 'till at la&s;t able to hold no longer, he &s;pit it out upon his plate, ex|claiming with an horrid oath, "A painted &s;nowball, by G&mdash;!" and wiping away his tears with his napkin, he turned in a rage to the Italian &s;ervant that had helped him, with a "d&mdash;n your maccaroni eyes, you &s;on of a b&mdash;, what did you mean by that?" The fellow, who did not under&s;tand a word of it, could not forbear &s;miling, which &s;till convinced the captain the more that it was a trick; and he was ju&s;t going to throw the re&s;t of the &s;how-ball in his face, but was prevented by one of the company; when recovering
<PB N="213" REF="024150_0223_0FC3D43CE966ADB8">
from his pa&s;&s;ion, and thinking the object unworthy of it, he only added in a &s;ofter tone, "Very well, neigh|bour, I only wi&s;h I had you on board &s;hip for half an hour, you &s;hould have a dozen before you could &s;ay Jack Robin&s;on, for all your painted cheeks."</P>
<P>I a&s;k pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion, but as it is a good laughable &s;tory, I know you will excu&s;e it. About &s;ix o'clock we took a cordial leave of our jolly friends at Agrigentum; and embarked on board our Sparonaro at the new port. I &s;hould have told you, that this harbour has lately been made at a very great expence; this city having always been one of the principal ports of the i&s;land, for the exportation of grain. The bi&s;hop and his company went into a large barge, and &s;ailed round the harbour, we &s;aluted them as we went out; they returned the compliment, and we took a &s;econd leave. The evening was fine, and we coa&s;ted along for a good many miles; we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal points and little promontories, that were exceedingly beautiful and picture&s;que, many of them were covered with noble large aloes in full blow. In one place, I count|ed upwards of 200 of tho&s;e fine maje&s;tic plants all in flower; a &s;ight which I imagined was hardly to be met with in the world. After &s;un-&s;et, alas, fain would I conceal what happened after &s;un-&s;et! but life you know is chequered with good and evil, and it would have been great pre&s;umption to receive &s;o much of the one, without expecting a little da&s;h of the other too. Be&s;ides, a &s;ea expedition is nothing without a &s;torm. Our journal would never have been readable, had it not been for this.&mdash;Well, I a&s;&s;ure you, we had it. It was not indeed &s;o violent as the great one off Loui&s;burgh, or perhaps even that de&s;cribed by Virgil; the reading of which is &s;aid to have made people &s;ea-&s;ick; but it was rather too much for our little bark.
<PB N="214" REF="024150_0224_0FC3D43E8A4902C8">
I was going to tell you that after &s;un-&s;et the &s;ky began to overca&s;t, and in a &s;hort time, the whole atmo&s;phere appeared fiery and threatning. We attempted to get into &s;ome creek, but could find none. The wind grew loud, and we found it was in vain to proceed: but as the night was dark and hazy, we were dubious about the po&s;&s;ibility of reaching the port of Agrigent|um. However, this was all we had for it, as there were none other within many miles. Accordingly we tacked about, and plying both oars and &s;ail, with great care not to come among&s;t the rocks and breakers, in about two hours we &s;pied the light-hou&s;e; by which we directed our cour&s;e, and got &s;afely into port, betwixt one and two in the morning: We lay down on our mattre&s;s, and &s;lept &s;ound 'till ten when finding the fal&s;ity of our hypothe&s;is, that there could be no bad weather in the mediterranean at this &s;ea&s;on, we unani|mou&s;ly agreed to have nothing more to do with Sparonaros, and &s;ent immediately to engage mules to carry us over the mountains to Palermo. The &s;torm continued with violence the whole day, and made us often thank heaven that we had got &s;afely back. It was not 'till five in the afternoon that we had mules, guides, and guards provided us; when we &s;et off, pretty much in the &s;ame order, and in the &s;ame equip|age as we had done about three weeks ago from Me&s;&s;ina. Our guards attempted to fill us with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions of this road, &s;hewing us every mile, where &s;uch a one was robbed, &s;uch another was murdered; and entertained us with &s;uch melan|choly ditties the greate&s;t part of the way. Indeed, if one half of their &s;tories be true, it is certainly the mo&s;t dangerous road in the world; but I looked upon mo&s;t of them as fictions, invented only to increa&s;e their own con&s;equence, and to procure a little more money. There is, indeed, &s;ome foundation for the&s;e &s;tories; as
<PB N="215" REF="024150_0225_0FC3D43FD35C7778">
there are numbers of gibbets erected on the road <HI>in terrorem;</HI> and every little baron has the power of life and death in his own domain. Our bi&s;hop's brother, who&s;e name I have forgot, &s;eized lately four and twenty of tho&s;e de&s;perate banditti, after a &s;tout re&s;i&s;t|ance, where &s;everal were killed on both &s;ides; and notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome of them were under the protection of the nobility, and in their &s;ervice, they were all hanged. However, this has by no means rooted them out. Our guard in the &s;u&s;picious places went with their pieces cock'd, and kept a clo&s;e look-out to either &s;ide of them; but we &s;aw nothing to alarm us, except the mo&s;t dreadful roads in the world; in many places wor&s;e than any thing I ever met with among the Alps.</P>
<P>After travelling about twenty miles, we arrived by two in the morning at the mo&s;t wretched, I don't know what to call it, there was not any one thing to be had but a little &s;traw for the mules. However, after a good deal of difficulty, we at la&s;t got fire enough to boil our tea-kettle, and having brought bread from Agrigentum, we made an excellent meal. Our tea-table was a round &s;tone in the field, and as the moon &s;hone bright, we had no occa&s;ion for any other lumi|nary. You may believe our &s;tay here was as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible; the hou&s;e was too dreadfully na&s;ty to enter it, and the &s;table was full of poor wretches &s;leeping on the bare ground. In &s;hort, I never &s;aw in any country &s;o mi&s;erable an Inn, for &s;o it is &s;tiled. We mounted our cavalry with all expedition, and in a very &s;hort time got into the woods, where we were &s;erenaded by the nightingales as we went along, who made us a full apology and atonement for the bad cheer we had met with. In a &s;hort time it was day, and then we had entertainment enough from the varied &s;cenes of the
<PB N="216" REF="024150_0226_0FC3D4450D54B458">
mo&s;t beautiful, wild and romantic country in the world. The fertility of many of the plains is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, without inclo&s;ures, without manure, and almo&s;t without culture. It is with rea&s;on, that this i&s;land was &s;tiled "Romeni imperii horreum," the granary of the Roman empire. Were it cultivated, it would &s;till be the great granary of Europe. Pliny &s;ays it yielded a hundred after one; and Diodorus, who was a native of the i&s;land, and wrote on the &s;pot, a&s;&s;ures us that it produced wheat and other grain &s;pon|taneou&s;ly; and Homer advances the &s;ame fact in the Ody&s;&s;ey:
<Q><L>The &s;oil untill'd, a ready harve&s;t yields,</L>
<L>With wheat and barley wave the golden fields;</L>
<L>Spontaneous wines from weighty clu&s;ters pour,</L>

<P>Many of the mountains &s;eemed to be formed by &s;ub|terraneous fire; &s;everal of them retain their conical figure and their craters, but not &s;o exact as tho&s;e on mount Aetna, as they are probably much older. I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved many pieces of lava on the road, and in the beds of the torrents; and a good deal of the &s;tone called tufa, which is certainly the production of a volcano; &s;o that I have no doubt, that a great part of this i&s;land, as well as the neighbouring ones of Lipa|ri, &amp;c. has been originally formed by &s;ubterraneous fire; we likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome quarries of a kind of talc; and al&s;o of a cour&s;e alaba&s;ter; of this they make a &s;ort of &s;tucco or plai&s;ter, re&s;embling that of Paris; but what I much regretted, we mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing the famous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alt of Agrigentum; found in the earth, about four or five miles from that city.

melts; but in the water it cracks and &s;plits, but never di&s;&s;olves. It is celebrated by Pliny, Ari&s;totle, and others of the ancient, as well as modern naturali&s;ts. Fazzello, whom I have brought along with me to read on the road, &s;ays, he has often experienced this; he adds from the authority of the&s;e ancient authors, that they formerly had mines of this &s;alt, &s;o pure and &s;olid, that the &s;tatuaries and &s;culptures preferred it to marble, and made various works of it.</P>
<P>The poor people of the village have found us out, and with looks full of mi&s;ery have &s;urrounded our door.

<P>WE are now arrived at the great capital of Sicily, which in our opinion in beauty and elegance is great|ly &s;uperior to Naples. It is not, indeed, &s;o large, but the regularity, the uniformity and neatne&s;s of its &s;treets and buildings, render it much more plea&s;ing; it is full of people, who have mo&s;tly an air of affluence and gaiety. And indeed we &s;eem to have got into a new world.&mdash; But &s;top, not &s;o fa&s;t:&mdash;I had forgot that you have &s;till 50 miles to travel on a cur&s;ed &s;tubborn mule, over rocks and precipices; for I can &s;ee no rea&s;on, why we &s;hould bring you at once into all the &s;weets of Paler|mo, without bearing at lea&s;t &s;ome little part in the fatigues of the journey. Come, we &s;hall make them as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We left you, I think, in a little village on the top of a high mountain. We &s;hould indeed u&s;e you very ill, were we to leave you there any longer; for I own it is the very wor&s;t country quarter, that ever fell to my

lot. However, we got a good comfortable &s;leep in it, the only one thing it afforded us; and the fleas, the bugs, and chickens, did all that lay in their power even to deprive us of that, but we defied them. Our two leaders came to awake us before five, apo&s;trophying their entry with a detail of the horrid robberies and murders that had been committed in the neighbour|hood; all of them, you may be &s;ure, on the very road that we were to go.</P>
<P>Our whole &s;quadron was drawn out, and we were ranged in order of battle, by five o'clock, when we began our march, attended by the whole village, man, woman, and child. We &s;oon got down among&s;t the woods, and endeavoured to forget the objects of mi&s;ery we had left behind us. The beauty and richne&s;s of the country increa&s;ed in proportion as we advanced. The mountains, although of a great height (that we have le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is near 4000 feet, the mercury &s;tanding at 26 inches 2 lines) are covered to the very &s;ummit with the riche&s;t pa&s;ture. The gra&s;s in the vallies is already burnt up, &s;o that the flocks are all upon the mountains. The gradual &s;eparation of heat and cold, is very vi&s;ible in taking a view of them. The vallies are brown and &s;corched, and &s;o are the mountains to a con&s;iderable height; they then begin to take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">de of green, which grows deeper and deeper, and covers the whole upper region; however, on the &s;ummit, the gra&s;s and corn are by no means &s;o luxuriant as about the middle. We were amazed at the richne&s;s of the crops, far &s;uperior to any thing I had ever &s;een either in England or Flanders, where the happy &s;oil is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the arts of cultivation; whil&s;t here, the wretched hu&s;bandman can hardly afford to give it a furrow; and gathers in with a heavy heart, the mo&s;t luxuriant harve&s;t. To what purpo&s;e is it given him? Only to lie a dead

weight upon his hand, &s;ometimes 'till it is entirely lo&s;t; exportation being prohibited to all &s;uch as cannot pay exorbitantly for it to the &s;overeign. What a contra&s;t is there betwixt this, and the little uncouth country of Switzerland! to be &s;ure, the dreadful con&s;equences of oppre&s;&s;ion can never be &s;et in a more &s;triking oppo|&s;ition to the ble&s;&s;ings and charms of liberty. Switzer|land, the very excre&s;cence of Europe, where nature &s;eems to have thrown out all her cold and &s;tagnating humours; full of lakes, mar&s;hes, and woods, and &s;urrounded by immen&s;e rocks, and everla&s;ting moun|tains of ice, the barren, but &s;acred, ramparts of liberty. Switzerland, enjoying every ble&s;&s;ing, where every ble&s;&s;ing &s;eems to have been denied; whil&s;t Sicily, cov|ered by the mo&s;t luxuriant hand of nature; where Heaven &s;eems to have &s;howered down its riche&s;t ble&s;&s;|ings with the utmo&s;t prodigality; groans under the mo&s;t abject poverty, and with a pale and wan vi&s;age, &s;tarves in the mid&s;t of plenty. It is liberty alone that works this &s;tanding miracle. Under her pla&s;tic hands the mountains &s;ink, the lakes are drained; and the&s;e rocks, the&s;e mar&s;hes, the&s;e woods, become &s;o many &s;ources of wealth and of plea&s;ure.

nor did I believe any one of the nine fooli&s;h enough to inhabit them, except Melpomene perhaps, as &s;he is fo fond of tragical faces: However, I &s;hall now get you out of them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and bring you once more into the gay world. I a&s;&s;ure you, I have often wi&s;hed that you could have lent me your mu&s;e, on this expedition; my letters would then have been more worth the reading; but you mu&s;t take the will for the deed.</P>
<P>After travelling 'till about midnight, we arrived at another mi&s;erable village, where we &s;lept for &s;ome hours on &s;traw, and continued our journey again by day-break. We had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the ri&s;ing &s;un from the top of a pretty high mountain, and were delighted with the pro&s;pect of Strombolo, and the other Lipari i&s;lands, at a great di&s;tance from us. On our de&s;cent from this mountain, we found our&s;elves on the banks of the &s;ea, and took that road, preferable to an inland one, although &s;everal miles nearer. We &s;oon lighted from our mules, and plunged into the water, which has ever made one of our greate&s;t plea&s;ures in this expedition: Nobody that has not tried it, can conceive the delight of this; after the fatigue of &s;uch a journey, and pa&s;&s;ing three days without undre&s;&s;ing. Your friend Fullarton, though only &s;eventeen, but who&s;e mind and body now equally de&s;pi&s;e every fatigue, found him&s;elf &s;trong as a lion, and fit to begin &s;uch another march. We boiled our tea-kettle under a fig-tree, and eat a breakfa&s;t that might have &s;erved a company of &s;trolling players.</P>
<P>The approach to Palermo is fine. The allies are planted with fruit trees, and large American aloes in full blow. Near the city we pa&s;&s;ed a place of execu|tion, where the quarters of a number of robbers were
<PB N="222" REF="024150_0232_0FC3D451C1BE5D88">
hung up upon hooks, like &s;o many hams; &s;ome of them appeared newly executed, and made a very un&s;ightly figure. On our arrival, we learned that a prie&s;t and three others had been taken a few days ago, after an ob&s;tinate defence, in which &s;everal were killed on both &s;ides; the prie&s;t, rather than &s;ubmit to his conquerors, plunged his hanger into his brea&s;t, and died on the &s;pot: The re&s;t &s;ubmitted and were executed.</P>
<P>As there is but one inn in Palermo, we were obli|ged to agree to their own terms (five ducats a day.) We are but indifferently lodged; however, it is the only inn we have yet &s;een in Sicily, and indeed, may be &s;aid to be the only one in the i&s;land. It is kept by a noi&s;y trouble&s;ome French-woman, who I find will plague us; there is no keeping her out of our rooms, and &s;he never comes in without telling us of &s;uch a prince and &s;uch a duke, that were &s;o &s;uperlatively happy at being lodged in her hou&s;e: We can ea&s;ily learn that they were all de&s;perately in love with her; and indeed &s;he &s;eems to take it very much ami&s;s, that we are not inclined to be of the &s;ame &s;entiments. I have already been obliged to tell her, that we are very retired &s;ort of people, and do not like company; I find &s;he does not e&s;teem us the better for it; and this morning (as I pa&s;&s;ed through the kitchen, without &s;peaking to her) I overheard her exclaim, <Q>Ah mon Dieu! comme ces Anglois &s;ont &s;auvages!</Q> I believe we mu&s;t take more notice of her, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall certainly have our rent rai&s;ed; but &s;he is as fat as a pig, and as ugly as the devil, and lays on a quantity of paint on each of her &s;welled cheeks that looks like a great plai&s;ter of red Morocco. Her picture is hanging in the room where I am now writing, as well as that of her hu&s;band, who, by the bye, is a ninny: They are no le&s;s vile curio&s;ities than the originals, He is drawn with his &s;nuff-box

open in one hand, and a di&s;h of coffee in the other; and at the &s;ame time, <HI>fait l'amiable &agrave; Madame.</HI> I took notice of this triple occupation, which &s;eemed to imply &s;omething particular. She told me that the thought was hers: That her hu&s;band was exceedingly fond of &s;nuff and of coffee, and wanted by this to &s;hew that he was &s;till more occupied with her than with either of them. I could not help applauding the ingenuity of the conceit. Madame is painted with an immen&s;e bouquet in her brea&s;t, and an orange in her right-hand, emblematic of her &s;weetne&s;s and purity; and has the prettie&s;t little &s;mirk on her face you can imagine. She told me that &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on the painter drawing her <HI>avec le &s;ouris &s;ur le vi&s;age,</HI> but as he had not <HI>e&s;prit</HI> enough to make her &s;mile naturally, &s;he was obliged to force one, <Q>qui n'etoit pas tout a fait &s;i jolie que le naturel, mais qui vaudroit toujours mieux que de paroitre &s;ombre;</Q> I agreed with her perfectly; and a&s;&s;ured her it became her very much, <Q>parceque les dames gra&s;&s;es &s;ont toujours de bonne humeur.</Q> I found, however, that &s;he would willingly have excu|&s;ed me the latter part of the compliment, which more than lo&s;t all that I had gained by the former. <Q>Il e&s;t vrai</Q> (&s;aid &s;he, a good deal piqued) <Q>j'ai un peu de l'embonpoint, mais pas tant gra&s;&s;e pourtant.</Q> I pretended to excu&s;e my&s;elf, from not under&s;tanding all the fine&s;&s;e of the language; and a&s;&s;ured her, that <HI>de l'embonpoint</HI> was the very phra&s;e I meant to make u&s;e of. She accepted the apology, and we are again reconciled; for, to give the devil his due, they are good-humoured. She made me a curt&s;ey, and repeat|ed, <Q>Oui, Mon&s;ieur, pour parler comme il faut, il faut dire <HI>de l'embonpoint</HI> On ne dit pas gra&s;&s;e.</Q> I a&s;&s;ured her, bowing to the ground, that the word &s;hould for ever be razed from my vocabulary. She left me with a gracious &s;mile, and a curt&s;ey much

This woman made me recollect (what I have always ob&s;erved) how little the manners of the French are to be changed by their connection with other nations; allowing none to be in any degree worthy of imitation but their own. Although &s;he has now been here the&s;e twenty years, &s;he is &s;till as perfectly French, as if &s;he had never been without the gates of Paris; and looks upon every woman in Palermo with the utmo&s;t contempt, becau&s;e they have never &s;een that capital, nor heard the &s;ublime mu&s;ic of its opera. She is like|wi&s;e (allowing for the difference of rank) an admirable epitome of all French women, who&s;e univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion has ever been the de&s;ire of admiration, and of appear|ing young; and ever would be, I believe, were they to live to the age of a thou&s;and. Any per&s;on that will take a look at the withered death's he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds in their pub|lic places, covered over with a thick ma&s;k of paint, will be convinced of this. Now, our old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dies, when they get to the wrong &s;ide of &s;ixty, generally take a jump up to the borders of four&s;core, and appear no le&s;s vain of their years, than ever they were of their youth.

I do not know whether a cheerful old woman, who is willing to appear &s;o, is more re&s;pecta|ble, or more e&s;timable; or a withered witch, who fills up every wrinkle with varni&s;h, and at four&s;core attempts to give her&s;elf the bloom of four-and-twenty, is ridiculous and contemptible: But as dinner is on the table, I &s;hall leave it to you to determine.

<P>I SHALL have a great deal to write you about this city; we are every day more delighted with it, and &s;hall leave it with much regret. We have now deliv|ered our letters, in con&s;equence of which we are loaded with civilities, and have got into a very agree|able &s;et of acquaintance. But I &s;hall fir&s;t attempt to give you &s;ome little idea of the town, and then &s;peak of its inhabitants. It is by much the mo&s;t regular I have &s;een, and is built upon that plan, which I think all large cities ought to follow. The two great &s;treets inter&s;ect each other in the centre of the city, where they form a hand&s;ome &s;quare, called the Ottangolo, adorned with elegant uniform buildings. From the centre of this &s;quare, you &s;ee the whole of the&s;e noble &s;treets, and the four great gates of the city which ter|minate them; the &s;ymmetry and beauty of which produce a fine effect. The whole of the&s;e are to be magnificently illuminated &s;ome time next month, and mu&s;t certainly be the fine&s;t &s;ight in the world. The four gates are each at the di&s;tance of about half a mile, (the diameter of the city being no more than a mile:) the&s;e are elegant pieces of architecture richly adorned; particularly the <HI>Porta Nova</HI> and <HI>Porta Felice,</HI> termi|nating the great &s;treet called the <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> that runs &s;outh-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t. The le&s;&s;er &s;treets in general run parallel to the&s;e great ones; &s;o that from every part of the city, in a few minutes walking, you are &s;ure to arrive at one of the capital &s;treets. The <HI>Porta Felice</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="024150_0236_0FC3D45B7A831488">
(by much the hand&s;ome&s;t of the&s;e gates) opens to the <HI>Marino,</HI> a delightful walk which con&s;titutes one of the great plea&s;ures of the nobility of Palermo. It is bounded on one &s;ide by the wall of the city, and on the other by the &s;ea, from whence, even at this &s;corching &s;ea&s;on there is always an agreeable breeze. In the centre of the Marino they have lately erected an elegant kind of temple, which, during the &s;ummer month, is made u&s;e of as an orche&s;tra for mu&s;ic; and as in this &s;ea&s;on they are obliged to convert the night into day, the concert does not begin 'till the clock &s;trikes mid|night, which is the &s;ignal for the &s;ymphony to &s;trike up; at that time the walk is crowded with carriages and people on foot; and the better to favour plea&s;ure and intrigue, there is an order, that no per&s;on, of what|ever quality, &s;hall pre&s;ume to carry a light with him. The flambeaux are extingui&s;hed at the Porta Felice, where the &s;ervants wait for the return of the carriages; and the company generally continue an hour or two together in utter darkne&s;s, except when the intruding moon, with her horns and her cha&s;tity, comes to di&s;turb them. The concert fini&s;hes about two in the morning, when, for the mo&s;t part, every hu&s;band goes home to his own wife. This is an admirable in&s;titu|tion, and never produces any &s;candal: No hu&s;band is &s;uch a brute as to deny his wife the Marino; and the ladies are &s;o cautious and circum&s;pect on their &s;ide, that the more to avoid giving offence, they very often put on ma&s;ques.</P>
<P>Their other amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;t chiefly in their <HI>Conver&s;aziones,</HI> of which they have a variety every night. There is one general one, &s;upported by the &s;ub&s;cription of the nobility, which is open every even|ing at &s;un-&s;et, and continues 'till midnight, when the Marino begins. It better de&s;erves the name of a

conver&s;ation than any I have &s;een it Italy; for here the people really come to conver&s;e, whereas in Italy, they only go to play at cards and eat ices. I have ob&s;erved, that &s;eldom or never one half of the company is enga|ged in play, nor do they either play long or deep. There are a number of apartments belonging to this conver&s;ation, illuminated with wax lights, and kept ex|ceedingly cool and agreeable; and it is indeed altogether one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and comfortable in&s;titutions I have &s;een: Be&s;ides this, there are generally a number of particular conver&s;ations every night, and what will a good deal &s;urpri&s;e you, the&s;e are always held in the apartments of the lying-in ladies; for in this happy, climate, child-bearing is dive&s;ted of all its terrors, and is only con&s;idered as a party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ure. This circum|&s;tance we were ignorant of 'till t'other morning. The duke of Verdura, who does us the honors of the place, with great attention and politene&s;s, came to tell us, we had a vi&s;it to make that was indi&s;pen&s;ible. <Q>The Prince&s;s Paterno (&s;aid he) was brought to bed la&s;t night; and it is ab&s;olutely incumbent on you to pay your re&s;pects to her this evening.</Q> At fir&s;t I thought he was in joke, but he a&s;&s;ured me he was &s;e|rious, and that it would be looked upon as a great un|politene&s;s to neglect it. Accordingly we went about &s;un-&s;et, and found the prince&s;s &s;itting up in her bed, in an elegant undre&s;s, with a number of her friends around her. She talked as u&s;ual, and &s;eemed to be perfectly well. This conver&s;ation is repeated every night dur|ing her conval &s;cence, which generally la&s;ts for about eleven or twelve days. This cu&s;tom is univer&s;al, and as the ladies here are very prolific, there are for the mo&s;t part three or four of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies going on in the city at the &s;ame time; po&s;&s;ibly the Marino may not a little contribute towards them.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="024150_0238_0FC3D462366AC558">The Sicilian ladies marry at thirteen or fourteen, and are &s;ometimes grandmothers before they are thirty. The Count Stetela pre&s;ented us a few days ago to his cou&s;in, the Prince&s;s Partana, who he told us had a great number of children, the elde&s;t of which was a very fine girl of fifteen. We talked to the prince&s;s for half an hour, not in the lea&s;t doubting all the time that &s;he was the daughter, 'till at last the young lady came in; and even then, it was not ea&s;y to &s;ay which appeared the hand&s;ome&s;t or the youngest. This lady has had twelve children, and is &s;till in her bloom; &s;he a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he never enjoyed more perfect health than when &s;he was in child-bed; that during the time of her pregnancy &s;he was often indi&s;po&s;ed, but that imme|diately on delivery &s;he was cured of all her complaints, and was capable of enjoying the company of her friends even more than at any other time. I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at this very &s;ingular happine&s;s of their cli|mate or con&s;titution; but appeared &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed when I told her that we lo&s;t many of our fine&s;t wo|men in child-bed, and that even the mo&s;t fortunate and ea&s;y deliveries were attended with violent pain and angui&s;h. She lamented the fate of our ladies, and thanked Heaven that &s;he was born a Sicilian.</P>
<P>What this &s;ingularity is owing to, let the learned determine; but it is &s;urely one of the capital ble&s;&s;ings of the&s;e climates, where the cur&s;e that was laid upon mother Eve &s;eems to be entirely taken off: I don't know how the ladies here have de&s;erved this exemption, as they have at lea&s;t as much both of Eve and the &s;er|pent as ours have, and &s;till retain their appetite, as &s;trong as ever, for forbidden fruit. It &s;eems hard, that in our own country, and in Switzerland, where the women in general are the cha&s;te&s;t in Europe, that this cur&s;e &s;hould fall the heavie&s;t; it is probably ow|ing

Thus, people with the &s;ame complaints are &s;ent to Aix and to Mar&s;eilles, although the air in the&s;e two places mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially different.

<P>OUR fondne&s;s for Palermo increa&s;es every day, and we are beginning to look forward with regret to the time of our leaving it, which is now fa&s;t approach|ing. We have made acquaintance with many &s;en&s;ible and agreeable people. The Sicilians appear frank and &s;incere; and their politene&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in &s;hew and grimace, like &s;ome of the polite nations of the continent. The viceroy &s;ets the pattern of ho&s;pitality, and he is followed by the re&s;t of the nobles. He is an amiable, agreeable man, and I believe is as much belov|ed and e&s;teemed as a viceroy to an ab&s;olute monarch can be. He was in England in his youth, and is &s;till fond of many of our authors, with whom he &s;eems to be intimately acquainted; he &s;peaks the language tolera|bly well, and encourages the learning of it among&s;t his people. He may be con&s;idered with regard to Naples as what the lord lieutenant of Ireland is with regard to England, with this trifling difference, that, like his ma&s;ter, he is inve&s;ted with an ab&s;olute author|ity;
<PB N="231" REF="024150_0241_0FC3D46E6029CF78">
and keeps his parliament (for he has one too) in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubjection. The patriots here, altho' a very numerous body, have never been able to gain one point, no nor a place, nor even a pen&s;ion for a needy friend. Had lord Town&s;hend the power of the marquis Fog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iano, I &s;uppo&s;e your Hibernian &s;quabbles (of which we hear &s;o much, even at this di&s;tant corner) would &s;oon have an end. Notwith&s;tanding this great authority, he is affable and familiar, and makes his hou&s;e agreeable to every body. We go very often to his a&s;&s;emblies, and have dined with him &s;everal times; his table is &s;erved with elegance and magnificence, much &s;uperior indeed to that of his Sicilian maje&s;ty, who eats off a &s;ervice of plate, at lea&s;t 300 years old, very black and ru&s;ty indeed: I heard a gentleman a&s;k one day, whil&s;t we were &s;tanding round the table, if it had not been dug out of Herculaneum. That of the viceroy is very elegant, and indeed die whole of his entertainments corre&s;pond with it; though we have as yet &s;een nothing here, to be compared to the luxury of our fea&s;t in the granary at Agrigentum.</P>
<P>The Sicilian cookery is a mixture of the French and Spani&s;h; and the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">io &s;till pre&s;erves its rank and dignity in the centre of the table, &s;urrounded by a numerous train of fricaffees, fricandeaus, ragouts, and pet de loups; like a grave Spani&s;h Don, amid&s;t a number of little &s;mart marquis. The other nobility whom we have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee, are likewi&s;e very magnificent in their entertainments; but mo&s;t particu|larly in their de&s;erts and ices, of which there is a greater variety than I have &s;een in my other country. They are very temperate with regard to wine; though, &s;ince we have taught them our method of toa&s;ting ladies they are fond of, and of hob and nobbing with their friends, ringing the two gla&s;&s;es together; this
<PB N="232" REF="024150_0242_0FC3D4739CBC4320">
&s;ocial practice has animated them &s;o much, that they have been &s;ometimes led to drink a greater quantity than they are accu&s;tomed to; and they often reproach us with having made them drunkards. In their ordi|nary living they are very frugal and temperate; and from the &s;obriety we have &s;een here, we are now more per&s;uaded that the elevated &s;ituation of Agrigentum mu&s;t be one great cau&s;e of its great drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Sicilians have always had the character of being very amorous, and &s;urely not without rea&s;on. The whole nation are poets, even the pea&s;ants; and a man &s;tands a poor chance for a mi&s;tre&s;s, that is not capable of celebrating her prai&s;es. I believe it is generally allowed that the pa&s;toral poetry had its origin in this i&s;land; and Theocritus, after whom they &s;till copy, will ever be looked upon as the prince of pa&s;toral poets. And indeed in mu&s;ic too, as well as poetry, the &s;oft amorous pieces are generally &s;tiled <HI>Sicilians;</HI> the&s;e they u&s;ed to play all night under their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es' windows, to expre&s;s the delicacy of their pa&s;&s;ion; but &s;erenading is not now &s;o much in fa&s;hion, as it was during the time of their more intimate connection with Spain, when it was faid by one of their authors, that no per&s;on could pa&s;s for a man of gallantry that had not got a cold; and was &s;ure never to &s;ucceed it in making love unle&s;s he made it in a hoar&s;e voice. The ladies are not now &s;o rigid, and will &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to hear a man, even although he &s;hould &s;peak in a clear tone. Nei|ther do they any longer require the prodigious martial &s;eats, that were then nece&s;&s;ary to win them. The attacking of a mad bull, or a wild boar, was reckoned the hand&s;ome&s;t compliment a lover could pay to his mi&s;tre&s;s; and the putting the&s;e animals to death &s;oftened her heart much more than all the &s;ighing love-&s;ick tales that could be invented. This has been humor|ou&s;ly
<PB N="233" REF="024150_0243_0FC3D474F8D1CE90">
ridiculed by one of their poets. He &s;ays that Cupid's little golden dart was now changed into a ma&s;&s;y &s;pent, which an&s;wered a double purpo&s;e; for at the &s;ame time that it pierced the tough bull's hide, it likewi&s;e pierced the tender lady's heart. But the&s;e Gothic cu&s;toms are now confined to Spain, and the gentle Sicilians have re-a&s;&s;umed their &s;oftne&s;s. To tell you the truth, gallantry is pretty much upon the &s;ame footing here as in Italy, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ci&s;bees is pretty general, though not quite &s;o univer&s;al as on the continent. However, a breach of the mar|riage-vow is no longer looked upon as one of the deadly &s;ins; and the confe&s;&s;or falls upon ea&s;y and plea&s;ant enough methods of making them atone for it. The hu&s;bands are content; and like able generals, make up for the lo&s;s of one fortte&s;s, by the taking of another. However, female licentiou&s;ne&s;s has by no means come to &s;uch a height as in Italy. We have &s;een a great deal of dome&s;tic happine&s;s; hu&s;bands and wives that truly love one another, and who&s;e mutual care and plea&s;ure is the education of their children. I could name a number: The Duke of Verdu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, the Prince Partana, the Count Bu&s;cemi, and many others who live in the mo&s;t &s;acred union. Such &s;ights are very rare on the continent. But indeed the &s;tile that young people are brought up in here, &s;eems to lay a much more &s;olid foundation for matrimonial happine&s;s, than either in France or Italy. The young ladies are not &s;hut up in convents 'till the day of their marriage, but for the mo&s;t part live in the hou&s;e with their parents, where they receive their education, and are every day in company with their friends and relations. From what I can ob&s;erve, I think they are allowed almo&s;t as much liberty as with us. In their great a&s;&s;emblies, we often &s;ee a club of young people (of both &s;exes) get together in a corner, and amu&s;e them&s;elves
<PB N="234" REF="024150_0244_0FC3D4768C1A7ED8">
for hours, at cro&s;s purpo&s;es, or &s;uch like games, without the mothers being under the lea&s;t anxiety; indeed, we &s;ometimes join in the&s;e little parties, and find them extremely entertaining. In general, they are quick and lively, and have a number of tho&s;e <HI>jeux d'e&s;prit,</HI> which I think mu&s;t ever be a proof, in all countries, of the familiar intercour&s;e betwixt the young people of the two &s;exes; for all the&s;e games are in&s;ipid, if they are not &s;ea&s;oned by &s;ometing of that invi&s;ible and &s;ubtle agency, which renders every thing more intere&s;t|ing in the&s;e mixed &s;ocieties, than in the lifele&s;s ones, compo&s;ed of only one part of the &s;pecies. Thus, in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, I have never &s;een any of the&s;e games; in France &s;eldom, but in Switzerland, (where the greate&s;t liberty and familiarity are enjoyed among&s;t the young people) they are numberle&s;s.&mdash;But the conver&s;ation hour is arrived, and our carriage is waiting.</P>

<P>THERE are two &s;mall countries, one to the ea&s;t, the other to the we&s;t of this city, where the principal nobility have their country palaces. Both the&s;e we have vi&s;ited; there are many noble hou&s;es in each of them. That to the ea&s;t is called La Bagaria, that to the we&s;t Il Colle. We are this in&s;tant returned from La Bagaria, and I ha&s;ten to give you an account of the ridiculous things we have &s;een, though perhaps you will not thank me for it.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="024150_0245_0FC3D47BD18411E0">The palace of the Prince of Valguanera is, I think, by much the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of all the hou&s;es of the Bagaria; but it is far from being the mo&s;t extra|ordinary: Were I to de&s;cribe it, I &s;hould only tell you of things you have often &s;een and heard of in other countries, &s;o I &s;hall only &s;peak of one, which, for its &s;ingularity, certainly is not to be paralleled on the face of the earth; it belongs to the prince of P&mdash;, a man of immen&s;e fortune, who has devoted his whole life to the &s;tudy of mon&s;ters and chimeras, greater and more ridiculous than ever entred into the imagination of the wilde&s;t writers of romance or knight-errantry.</P>
<P>The amazing crowd of &s;tatues that &s;urround his hou&s;e, appear at a di&s;tance like a little army drawn up for its defence; but when you get among&s;t them, and every one a&s;&s;umes his true likene&s;s, you imagine you have got into the regions of delu&s;ion and enchantment; for of all that immen&s;e group, there is not one made to repre&s;ent any object in nature; nor is the ab&s;urdity of the wretched imagination that created them le&s;s a&s;ton|i&s;hing than its wonderful fertility. It would require a volume to de&s;cribe the whole, and a &s;ad volume indeed it would make. He has put the heads of men to the bodies of every &s;ort of animal, and the heads of every other animal to the bodies of men. Sometimes he makes a compound of five or &s;ix animals that have no &s;ort of re&s;emblance in nature. He puts the head of a lion to the neck of a goo&s;e, the body of a lizard, the legs of a goat, the tail of a fox. On the back of this mon&s;ter, he puts another if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more hideous, with five or &s;ix heads, and a bu&s;h of horns, that beats the bea&s;t in the Revelations all to nothing. There is no kind of horn in the world that he has not collected; and his plea&s;ure is, to &s;ee them all flouri&s;hing upon the &s;ame head. This is a &s;trange &s;pecies of madne&s;s; and
<PB N="236" REF="024150_0246_0FC3D47FB7FF5B90">
it is truly unaccountable that he has not been &s;hut up many years ago; but he is perfectly innocent, and troubles nobody by the indulgence of his phrenzy; on the contrary, he gives bread to a number of &s;tatuaries and other workmen, whom he rewards in proportion as they can bring their imaginations to coincide with his own; or, in other words, according to the hideou&s;ne&s;s of the mon&s;ters they produce. It would be idle and tire&s;ome to be particular in an account of the&s;e ab&s;ur|dities. The &s;tatues that adorn, or rather deform the great avenue, and &s;urround the court of the palace, amount already to 600, notwith&s;tanding which, it may be truly &s;aid, that he has not broke the &s;econd command|ment; for of all that number, there is not the likene&s;s of any thing in heaven above, in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. The old ornaments which were put up by his father, who was a &s;en&s;ible man, appear to have been in a good ta&s;te. They have all been knocked to pieces, and laid together in a heap, to make room for this new creation.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of this inchanted ca&s;tle corre&s;ponds exact|ly with the out; it is in every re&s;pect as whim&s;ical and fanta&s;tical, and you cannot turn your&s;elf to any &s;ide, where you are not &s;tated in the face by &s;ome hideous figure or other. Some of the apartments are &s;pacious and magnificent, with high arched roofs; which in&s;tead of plai&s;ter or &s;tucco, are compo&s;ed entirely of large mirrors, nicely joined together. The effect that the&s;e produce (as each of them make a small angle with the other) is exactly that of a multiplying gla&s;s; &s;o that when three or four people are walking below, there is always the appearance of three or four hun|dred walking above. The whole of the doors are likewi&s;e covered over with &s;mall pieces of mirror, cut into the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;hapes, and intermixed with a
<PB N="237" REF="024150_0247_0FC3D48BF5515E48">
great variety of cry&s;tal and gla&s;s of different colours. All the chimney-pieces, windows, and &s;ide-boards are crowded with pyramids and pillars of tea-pots, caudle-cups, bowls, cups, &s;aucers, &amp;c. &s;trongly cemented together; &s;ome of the&s;e columns are not without their beauty: one of them has a large china chamber-pot for its ba&s;e, and a circle of pretty little flower-pots for its capital: the &s;haft of the column, upwards of four feet long, is compo&s;ed entirely of tea-pots of different &s;izes, dimini&s;hing gradually from the ba&s;e to the capital. The profu&s;ion of china that has been employed in form|ing the&s;e columns is incredible; I dare &s;ay there is not le&s;s than forty pillars and pyramids formed in this &s;trange fanta&s;tic manner.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the rooms are paved with fine marble tables of different colours, that look like &s;o many tomb-&s;tones. Some of the&s;e are richly wrought with lapis lazuli, porphyry, and other valuable &s;tones; their fine poli&s;h is now gone, and they only appear like common marble; the place of the&s;e beautiful tables he has &s;upplied by a new &s;et of his own invention, &s;ome of which are not without their merit. The&s;e are made of the fine&s;t tortoi&s;e-&s;hell mixed with mother of pearl, ivory, and a variety of metals; and are mounted on fine &s;tands of &s;olid bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The windows of this enchanted ca&s;tle are compo&s;ed of a variety of gla&s;s of every different colour, mixed without any &s;ort of order or regularity. Blue, red, green, yellow, purple, violet. So that at each window, you may have the heavens and earth of whatever col|our you chu&s;e, only by looking through the pane that plea&s;es you.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-clock is ca&s;ed in the body of a &s;tatue;

the eyes of the figure move with the pendulum, turn|ing up their white and black alternately, and make a hideous appearance.</P>
<P>His bed-chamber and dre&s;&s;ing-room are like two apartments in Noah's ark; there is &s;carce a bea&s;t, how|ever vile, that he has not placed there; toads, frogs, &s;erpents, lizards, &s;corpions, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut out in marble, of their re&s;pective colours. There are a good many bu&s;ts too, that are not le&s;s &s;ingularly imagined. Some of the&s;e make a very hand&s;ome profile on one &s;ide; turn to the other, and you have a &s;keleton; here you &s;ee a nur&s;e with a child in her arms; its back is exactly that of an infant; its face is that of a wrinkled old woman of ninety.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes one can laugh at the&s;e follies, but indignation and contempt &s;oon get the better of your mirth, and the laugh is turned into a &s;neer. I own I was &s;oon tired of them; though &s;ome things are &s;o &s;trangely fancied, that it may well excu&s;e a little mirth, even from the mo&s;t rigid cynic.</P>
<P>The family &s;tatues are charming; they have been done from &s;ome old pictures, and make a mo&s;t venera|ble appearance; he has dre&s;&s;ed them out from head to foot, in new and elegant &s;uits of marble; and indeed the effect it produces is more ridiculous than any thing you can conceive. Their &s;hoes are all of black marble, their &s;tockings generally of red; their clothes are of different colours, blue, green, and variegated with a rich lace of <HI>giall antique.</HI> The periwigs of the men and head-dre&s;&s;es of the ladies are of fine white; &s;o are their &s;hirts, with long flowing ruffles of alaba&s;ter. The walls of the hou&s;e are covered with &s;ome fine ba&s;&s;o relievos of white marble, in a good ta&s;te; the&s;e

he could not well take out, or alter, &s;o he has only added immen&s;e frames to them. Each frame is com|po&s;ed of four large marble tables.</P>
<P>The author and owner of this &s;ingular collection is a poor mi&s;erable lean figure, &s;hivering at a breeze, and &s;eems to be afraid of every body he &s;peaks to; but (what &s;urpri&s;ed me) I have heard him talk &s;peciou&s;ly enough on &s;everal occa&s;ions. He is one of the riche&s;t &s;ubjects in the i&s;land, and it is thought he has not laid out le&s;s than 20,000 pounds in the creation of this world of mon&s;ters and chimeras. He certainly might have fallen upon &s;ome way to prove him&s;elf a fool at a cheaper rate. However it gives bread to a number of poor people, to whom he is an excellent ma&s;ter. His hou&s;e at Palermo is a good deal in the &s;ame &s;tile: His carriages are covered with plates of bra&s;s, &s;o that I really believe &s;ome of them are mu&s;ket proof.</P>
<P>The government have had &s;erious thoughts of demoli&s;hing the regiment of mon&s;ters he has placed round his hou&s;e, but as he is humane and inoffen&s;ive, and as this would certainly break his heart, they have as yet forborne. However, the &s;eeing of them by women with child is &s;aid to have been already attended with very unfortunate circum&s;tances; &s;everal living mon&s;ters having been brought forth in the neighbour|hood. The ladies complain that they dare no longer take an airing in the Bagaria; that &s;ome hideous form always haunts their imagination for &s;ome time after: Their hu&s;bands too, it is &s;aid, are as little &s;atisfied with the great variety of horns.

<P>THE account the people here give of the &s;irocc, or &s;outh-ea&s;t wind, is truly wonderful; to-day, at the vice|roy's we were complaining of the violence of the heat, the thermometer being at 79. They a&s;&s;ured us, that if we &s;taid till the end of next month, we &s;hould probably look on this at plea&s;ant cool weather; adding, that if we had once experienced the &s;irocc, all other weather will appear temperate. I a&s;ked to what degree the thermometer commonly ro&s;e during this wind; but found to my &s;urpri&s;e, that there was no &s;uch in&s;trument in u&s;e among&s;t them: However, the violence of it, they a&s;&s;ure us, is incredible; and that tho&s;e who had remained many years in Spain and Malta, had never felt any heat in tho&s;e countries to compare to it. How it happens to be more violent in Palermo than in any other part of Sicily, is a my&s;tery that &s;till remains to be unfolded. Several treati&s;es have been written on this &s;ubject, but none that give any tolerable degree of &s;atisfaction. As we &s;hall &s;tay for &s;ome time longer, it is po&s;&s;ible we may have an opportunity of giving you &s;ome account of it.</P>
<P>They have begun &s;ome weeks ago to make prepara|tions for the great fea&s;t of St. Ro&s;olia; and our friends here &s;ay they are determined that we &s;hall not leave them 'till after it is over; but this I am afraid will not be in our power. The warm &s;ea&s;on advances, and the time we appointed for our return to Naples is already elap&s;ed; but indeed, return when we will, we
<PB N="241" REF="024150_0251_0FC3D491E0707950">
&s;hall make but a bad exchange; and were it not for tho&s;e of our own country whom we have left behind us, we certainly &s;hould have determined on a much longer &s;tay. But although the &s;ociety here is &s;uperior to that of Naples, yet, call it prejudice, or call it what you will, there is a <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi,</HI> a certain confidence in the character, the worth, and friend&s;hip of our own people, that I have &s;eldom felt any where on the conti|nent, except in Switzerland. This &s;en&s;ation, which con&s;titutes the charm of &s;ociety, and can alone render it &s;upportable for any time, is only in&s;pired by &s;ome|thing analogous, and &s;ympathetic, in our feelings and &s;entiments; like two in&s;truments that are in uni&s;on, and vibrate to each other's touch: For &s;ociety is a concert, and if the in&s;truments are not in tune, there never can be harmony; and (to carry on the metaphor) this harmony too mu&s;t &s;ometimes be heightened and &s;up|ported by the introduction of a di&s;cord; but where di&s;cords predominate, which is often the ca&s;e between an En|gli&s;h and an Italian mind, the mu&s;ic mu&s;t be wretched indeed. Had we but a little mixture of our own &s;ocie|ty, how gladly &s;hould we &s;pend the winter in Sicily; but we often think with regret on Mr. Hamilton's and Mr. Walter's families; and wi&s;h again to be on the continent. Indeed, even the plea&s;ures we enjoy here, we owe principally to Mr. Hamilton: His recommen|dations we have ever found to be the be&s;t pa&s;&s;port and in|troduction; and the zeal and cordiality with which the&s;e are always received, proceeds evidently not from motives of deference and re&s;pect to the mini&s;ter, but of love and affection to the man.</P>
<P>This morning we went to &s;ee a celebrated convent of Capuchins, about a mile without the city; it contains nothing very remarkable but the burial-place, which indeed is a great curio&s;ity. This is a va&s;t &s;ubterraneous

apartment, divided into large commodious galleries, the walls on each &s;ide of which are hollowed into a va|riety of niches, as if intended for a great collection of &s;tatues; the&s;e niches, in&s;tead of &s;tatues, are all filled with dead bodies, &s;et upright upon their legs, and fixed by the back to the in&s;ide of the nich: Their number is about three hundred; they are all dre&s;&s;ed in the clothes they u&s;ually wore, and form a mo&s;t re&s;pectable and venerable a&s;&s;embly. The &s;kin and mu&s;cles, by a certain preparation, be|come as dry and hard as a piece of &s;tock-fi&s;h; and although many of them have been here upwards of two hundred and fifty years, yet none are reduced to &s;kele|tons; the mu&s;cles, indeed, in &s;ome appear to be a good deal more &s;hrunk than in others; probably becau&s;e the&s;e per&s;ons had been more extenuated at the time of their death.</P>
<P>Here the people of Palermo pay daily vi&s;its to their decea&s;ed friends, and recal with plea&s;ure and regret the &s;cenes of their pa&s;t life: Here they familiarize them|&s;elves with their future &s;tate, and chu&s;e the company they would wi&s;h to keep in the other world. It is a common thing to make choice of their nich, and to try if their body fits it, that no alterations may be nece&s;&s;ary after they are dead; and &s;ometimes, by way of a volun|tary penance, they accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;tand for hours in the&s;e niches.</P>
<P>The bodies of the princes and fir&s;t nobility are lodg|ed in hand&s;ome che&s;ts or trunks, &s;ome of them richly adorned: The&s;e are not in the &s;hape of coffins, but all of one width, and about a foot and a half, or two feet deep. The keys are kept by the neare&s;t relations of the family, who &s;ometimes come and drop a tear over their departed friends.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="024150_0253_0FC3D49845802848">I am not &s;ure if this is not a better method of di&s;po|&s;ing of the dead than ours. The&s;e vi&s;its mu&s;t prove admirable le&s;&s;ons of humility; and I a&s;&s;ure you, they are not &s;uch objects of horror as you would imagine: They are &s;aid, even for ages after death, to retain a &s;trong likene&s;s to what they were when alive; &s;o that, as &s;oon as you have conquered the fir&s;t feelings excited by the&s;e venerable figures, you only con&s;ider this as a va&s;t gallery of original portraits, drawn after the life, by the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t unprejudiced hand. It mu&s;t be owned that the colours are rather faded; and the pencil does not appear to have been the mo&s;t flattering in the world; but no matter, it is the pencil of truth, and not of a mercenary, who only wants to plea&s;e. We were alledging too, that it might be made of very con&s;iderable utility to &s;ociety; and that the&s;e dumb ora|tors could give the mo&s;t pathetic lectures upon pride and vanity. Whenever a fellow began to &s;trut, like Mr. B. or to affect the haughty &s;upercilious air, he &s;hould be &s;ent to conver&s;e with his friends in the galle|ry; and if their arguments did not bring him to a prop|er way of thinking, I would give him up as incorrigi|ble.</P>
<P>At Bologna they &s;hewed us the &s;keleton of a celebra|ted beauty, who died at a period of life when &s;he was &s;till the object of univer&s;al admiration. By way of making a|tonement for her own vanity, &s;he bequeathed her&s;elf as a monument to curb the vanity of others. Recollecting on her death-bed the great adulation that had been paid to her charms, and the fatal change they were &s;oon to undergo, &s;he ordered that her body &s;hould be di&s;&s;ected, and her bones hung up for the in&s;pection of all young maidens who are inclined to be vain of their beauty. However, if &s;he had been pre&s;erved in this moral gallery, the le&s;&s;on would have been &s;tronger; for tho&s;e very

features that had rai&s;ed her vanity would &s;till have repainted, only dive&s;ted of all their power, and di&s;arm|ed of every charm.</P>
<P>Some of the Capuchins &s;leep in the&s;e galleries every night, and pretend to have many wonderful vi&s;ions and revelations; but the truth is, that very few people believe them.</P>
<P>No woman is ever admitted into this convent either dead or alive; and this interdiction is written in large characters over the gate. The poor indolent Capu|chins, the fraile&s;t of all fle&s;h, have great need of &s;uch precautions: They have no occupation from without, and they have no re&s;ources within them&s;elves, &s;o that they mu&s;t be an ea&s;y prey to every temptation: Bocac|cio, and all the books of that kind, are filled with &s;tories of their frailty. Ye&s;terday, dining at the Prince of Sperlinga's, and talking on this &s;ubject, the Abb&eacute; T&mdash;gave us an anecdote of a friend of his, who was formerly a brother of this convent. He is known by the name of Fra Pa&s;qual, and has pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;ingular &s;cenes of life, which it would be too long to recount. His la&s;t migration, or, if you will, tran&s;migration, was from one of the banditti of this kingdom, in which capacity he had been enrolled for &s;ome time; but, tired of the danger and fatigue to which he was perpetually expo&s;ed, he at la&s;t determin|ed to exchange the character of the hero, for that of the &s;aint, and try if it was not both &s;afer and &s;urer, to rely on the weakne&s;s of others, than on our own &s;trength.</P>
<P>Fra Pa&s;qual pretended a &s;trong compunction for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his pa&s;t life, and made a promi&s;e to the Virgin, that the remainder of it &s;hould be &s;pent
<PB N="245" REF="024150_0255_0FC3D49E3737C1E8">
in mortification and penance, to atone for them. To this end, Pa&s;qual took the vows of poverty and of cha&s;tity, and entered into all the rigours of the mona&s;tic life. For &s;ome weeks he behaved in a mo&s;t exemplary man|ner; he went barefooted, wore a large ro&s;ary, and a thicker cord of di&s;cipline than any monk in the con|vent; and his whole deportment gave te&s;timony of the mo&s;t unfeigned repentance; however, the devil was &s;till at work in the heart of Pa&s;qual, and all the&s;e ex|ternal mortifications only made him work the harder; in &s;hort, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to drive him out: Pa&s;qual was &s;en&s;ible of this; and afraid le&s;t the enemy &s;hould at la&s;t get the better of him, he thought it advi&s;eable to leave at Palermo the character of &s;anctity he had acquired, and begin &s;omewhere el&s;e upon a new &s;core. He embarked for Naples, where he was &s;oon admitted into a Capuchin convent.</P>
<P>As Pa&s;qual knew from experience that the dull uni|formity of the mona&s;tic life required &s;ome little amu&s;e|ments to render it &s;upportable, the fir&s;t thing he &s;et about was to find a mi&s;tre&s;s. He made love to a lady of ea&s;y virtue, who &s;oon admitted his addre&s;&s;es, but at the &s;ame time informed him, that he had a formidable rival, who was jealous as a tiger, and would not fail to put them both to death, &s;hould he di&s;cover the intrigue. This was no other than a lifeguard-man, a fellow of &s;ix feet two inches, with a va&s;t &s;pada, like that of Goliath, and a mon&s;trous pair of curled whi&s;kers, that would have ca&s;t a damp on the heart of any man but Fra Pa&s;qual; but the mona&s;tic life had not yet ener|vated him; he was accu&s;tomed to danger, and loved a few difficulties: however, as in his pre&s;ent character he could not be on a footing with his rival, he thought it be&s;t only to make u&s;e of prudence and &s;tratagem to &s;upplant him: The&s;e are the eccle&s;ia&s;tical arms, and
<PB N="246" REF="024150_0256_0FC3D4A0420DFC58">
they have generally been found too hard for the military.</P>
<P>The lady promi&s;ed him an interview as &s;oon as the court &s;hould go to Portici, where the lifeguard-man's duty obliged him to attend the king. Pa&s;qual waited with impatience for &s;ome time; at la&s;t the wi&s;hed-for night arrived; the king &s;et off, after the opera, with all his guards. Pa&s;qual flew like lightning to the arms of his mi&s;tre&s;s; the preliminaries were &s;oon &s;et|tled; and the happy lovers had ju&s;t fallen a&s;leep, when they were &s;uddenly alarmed by a rap and a well known voice at the door. The lady &s;tarted up in an agony of de&s;pair, a&s;&s;uring Pa&s;qual that they were both undone; that this was her lover; and if &s;ome expedient was not fallen upon, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his fury, he would certainly put them both to death. There was no time for reflection; the lifeguard-man demanded entrance in the mo&s;t peremptory manner, and the lady was obli|ged to in&s;tant compliance. Pa&s;qual had ju&s;t time to gather his rags together, and cram him&s;elf in below the bed; at that in&s;tant the door opened, and the giant came in, rattling his arms and &s;torming at his mi&s;tre&s;s, for having made him wait &s;o long; however, &s;he &s;oon pacified him. He then ordered her to &s;trike a light, that he might &s;ee to undre&s;s: This &s;truck Pa&s;qual to the &s;oul, and he gave him&s;elf up for lo&s;t; however, the lady's addre&s;s &s;aved him, when he lea&s;t expected it. In bringing the tinder, &s;he took care to let fall &s;ome water into the box; and all the beating &s;he and her lover could beat, they could not produce one &s;park. Every &s;troke of the flint &s;ounded in Pa&s;qual's ears like his death-knell; but when he heard the lifeguard-man &s;wearing at the tinder for not kindling, he began to conceive &s;ome hopes, and ble&s;&s;ed the fertile invention of woman. The lady told him he might ea&s;ily get a light at the guard, which was at no great di&s;tance.
<PB N="247" REF="024150_0257_0FC3D4A5EBB521F8">
Pa&s;qual's heart leaped with joy; but when the &s;oldier an&s;wered that he was ab&s;ent without leave, and dur&s;t not be &s;een, it again began to flag; but on his ordering <HI>her</HI> to go, it died within him, and he now found him|&s;elf in greater danger than ever. The lady her&s;elf was di&s;concerted; but quickly recovering, &s;he told him, it would be too long before &s;he could get dre&s;&s;ed; but advi&s;ed him to go to the corner of a neighbouring &s;treet, where there was a lamp burning before the Vir|gin Mary, who could have no objection to his lighting a candle at it. Pa&s;qual revived; but the &s;oldier decla|red he was too much fatigued with his walk, and would rather undre&s;s in the dark; he at the &s;ame time began to grope below the bed for a bottle of liqueurs, which he knew &s;tood there. Pa&s;qual &s;hook like a quaker, however, &s;till he e&s;caped. The lady ob&s;erving what he was about, made a &s;pring, and got him the bot|tle, at the very in&s;tant he was within an inch of &s;eiz|ing Pa&s;qual's head. The lady then went to bed, and told her lover, as it was a cold night, &s;he would warm his place for him. Pa&s;qual admired her addre&s;s, and began to conceive &s;ome hopes of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation was the mo&s;t irk&s;ome in the world; the bed was &s;o low, that he had no room to move; and when the great heavy lifeguard-man entered it, he found him&s;elf &s;queezed down to the ground. He lay trembling and &s;tifling his breath for &s;ome time, but found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport his &s;ituation 'till morning; and indeed, if it had, his clothes, which were &s;cattered about, mu&s;t infallibly di&s;cover him: He therefore began to think of making his e&s;cape; but he could not move without alarming his rival, who was now lying above him. At fir&s;t he thought of ru&s;hing &s;uddenly out, and throwing him&s;elf into the &s;treet; but this he di&s;dained, and, on &s;econd thoughts,
<PB N="248" REF="024150_0258_0FC3D4AB2A0850A0">
determined to &s;eize the lifeguard-man's &s;word, and either put him to death, or make an honorable capitu|lation both for him&s;elf and the lady. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections, his rival began to &s;nore, and Pa&s;qual declares that no mu&s;ic was ever &s;o grateful to his &s;oul. He tried to &s;tir a little, and finding that did not awake the enemy, he by degrees worked him&s;elf out of his pri&s;on. He immediately laid hold of the great &s;pada; when all his fears for&s;ook him, and he felt as bold as a lion. He now relinqui&s;hed the da&s;tardly &s;cheme of e&s;caping, and only thought how he could be&s;t retaliate on his rival, for all that he had made him &s;uffer.</P>
<P>As Pa&s;qual was &s;tark naked, it was no more trouble to him to put on the &s;oldier's clothes than his own; and as both his cloak and his cappouch together were not worth a &s;ixpence, he thought it mo&s;t eligible to equip him&s;elf &agrave; la militaire, and to leave his &s;acerdotal robes to the &s;oldier. In a &s;hort time he was dre&s;&s;ed cap-a-pie. His grea&s;y cowl, his cloak, his &s;andals, his ro&s;ary, and his rope of di&s;cipline, he gathered together, and placed on a chair before the bed; and girded him|&s;elf with a great buff belt, in&s;tead of the cordon of St. Francis, and gra&s;ping his tru&s;ty Toledo in&s;tead of the crucifix, he &s;allied forth into the &s;treet. He pondered for &s;ome time what &s;cheme to fall upon; and at fir&s;t thought of returning in the character of another life-guard-man, pretending to have been &s;ent by the officer with a guard in que&s;t of his companion, who not being found in his quarters, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;erted: And thus, after having made him pay heartily for all that he had &s;uffered under the bed, to leave him to the enjoyment of his panic, and the elegant &s;uit of clothes he had provided him. However, he was not &s;atisfied with this revenge, and determined on one &s;till
<PB N="249" REF="024150_0259_0FC3D4ACB481C5C0">
more &s;olid. He went to the guard, and told the offi|cer that he had met a Capuchin friar, with all the en&s;igns of his &s;anctity about him, &s;culking through the &s;treets, in the dead of night, when they pretend to be em|ployed in prayer for the &s;ins of mankind. That prompt|ed by curio&s;ity to follow him, the holy friar as he expected went &s;trait to the hou&s;e of a celebrated courtezan; that he &s;aw him admitted, and li&s;tened at the window 'till he heard them go to bed together: That if he did not find this information to be true, he &s;hould re&s;ign him&s;elf his pri&s;oner, and &s;ubmit to whatever puni&s;h|ment he &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>The officer and his guard delighted to have much a hold of a Capuchin (who pretended to be the very models of &s;anctity, and who revile in a particular man|ner the licentious life of the military) turned out with the utmo&s;t alacrity, and, under the conduct of Pa&s;qual, &s;urrounded the lady's hou&s;e. Pa&s;qual began thunder|ing at the door; and demanded entrance for the officer and his guard. The unhappy &s;oldier waking with the noi&s;e, and not doubting that it was a detachment &s;ent to &s;eize him, gave him&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and in&s;tantly took &s;helter in the very place that Pa&s;qual had &s;o lately occupied; at the &s;ame time laying hold of all the things he found on the chair, never doubting that they were his own clothes. As the lady was &s;omewhat dilatory in opening the door, Pa&s;qual pretended to put his foot to it, when up it flew, and entering with the officer and his guard, demanded the body of a Capuchin friar, who they were informed, lodged with her that night. The lady had heard Pa&s;qual go out, and having no &s;u&s;picion that he would inform again&s;t him&s;elf, &s;he prote&s;ted her innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, taking all the &s;aints to witne&s;s that &s;he knew no &s;uch per&s;on: But Pa&s;qual &s;u&s;pecting the retreat of the lover,
<PB N="250" REF="024150_0260_0FC3D4AE1AAA6698">
began groping below the bed, and &s;oon pulled out his own grea&s;y cowl and cloak; "Here &s;aid he to the officer) <Q>here are proofs enough: I'll an&s;wer for it, <HI>Signor Padre</HI> him&s;elf is at no great di&s;tance.</Q> And putting his no&s;e below the bed; <Q>Fogh (&s;ays he) I &s;mell him; he &s;tinks like a fox. The &s;ure&s;t way of finding a Capuchin, is by the no&s;e; you may wind him a mile off.</Q> Then lowering their lanthorn, they beheld the unfortunate lover &s;queezed in betwixt the bed and the ground, and almo&s;t &s;tifled. <Q><HI>Ecco <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (&s;aid Pa&s;qual) here he is, with all the en&s;igns of his holine&s;s;</Q> and pulling them out one by one, the crucifix, the ro&s;ary, and me cord of di&s;cipline. <Q>You may &s;ee (&s;aid he) that the reverend father came here to do penance;</Q> and taking up the cord, <Q>Sup|po&s;e now we &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this meritorious work. <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, Signor Padre, andiam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> We will &s;ave you the trouble of inflicting it your&s;elf; and whether you came here to &s;in, or to repent, by your own maxims, you know, a little &s;ound di&s;ci|pline is healthful to the &s;oul.</Q> The guard were lying round the bed in convul&s;ions of laughter; and began breaking the mo&s;t galling and mo&s;t in&s;olent jokes upon the &s;uppo&s;ed padre. The lifeguard-man thought him&s;elf enchanted. He at la&s;t ventured to &s;peak, and declared they were all in a mi&s;take; that he was no Capuchin: Upon which the laugh redoub|led, and the coar&s;e&s;t jokes were repeated. The lady, in the mean time, with the be&s;t di&s;&s;embled marks of fear and a&s;toni&s;hment, ran about the room, exclaiming, <Q><HI>Oime! &s;iamo perduti&mdash;Siamo incantati&mdash;Siamo in&s;orce|lati.</HI></Q> Pa&s;qual delighted to &s;ee that his plan had taken its full effect, thought it now time to make his retreat, before the unfortunate lover could have an op|portunity of examining his clothes, and perhaps detect|ing him: He therefore pretended regimental bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="251" REF="024150_0261_0FC3D4AFC135E7F0">
and regretting much that he was obliged to join his corps, took leave of the officer and his guard; at the &s;ame time recommending by all means, to treat the holy father with all that reverence and re&s;pect that was due to &s;o &s;acred a per&s;on.</P>
<P>The lifeguard-man, when he got out from below the bed, began to look about for his clothes; but ob|&s;erving nothing but the grea&s;y weeds of a Capuchin friar, he was now perfectly convinced, that Heaven had delivered him over, for his offences, to the power of &s;ome daemon (for of all mortals, the Neapolitan &s;oldiers are the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious.) The lady too, acted her part &s;o well, that he had no longer any doubt of it. <Q>Thus it is (&s;aid he in a penitential voice) to offend heaven! I own my &s;in. I knew it was Friday, and yet, O, fle&s;h, fle&s;h! Had it been any other day, I &s;till &s;hould have remained what I was. O St. Gennaro!

Gentlemen, do with me what you plea&s;e; I am not what I &s;eem to be." "No, no, (&s;aid the officer) we are &s;en&s;ible of that. But, come, Signor Padre, on with your garments, and march; we have no time to trifle. Here, Corporal, (giving him the cordon) tie his hands, and let him feel the weight of St. Francis. The &s;aint owes him that, for having &s;o impudently denied him for his ma&s;ter.</Q> The poor &s;oldier was perfectly pa&s;&s;ive; they arrayed him in the &s;andals, the cowl, and the cloak of Fra Pa&s;qual, and put the great ro&s;ary about his neck; and a mo&s;t woeful figure he made. The officer made him look in the gla&s;s, to try if he could recollect him&s;elf, and a&s;ked if he was a

Capuchin now or not. He was &s;hocked at his own appearance; but bore every thing with meekne&s;s and re&s;ignation. They then conducted him to the guard, belabouring him all the way with the cord of St. Fran|cis, and a&s;king him every &s;troke, if he knew his ma&s;ter now?</P>
<P>In the mean time, Pa&s;qual was &s;nug in his convent, enjoying the &s;weets of his adventure. He had a &s;pare cloak and cowl, and was &s;oon equipped again like one of the holy fathers; he then took the clothes and accoutrements of the lifeguard-man, and laid them in a heap, near the gate of another convent of Capuchins, but at a great di&s;tance from his own, re&s;erving only to him&s;elf a trifle of money which he found in the breeches pocket, ju&s;t to indemnify him for the lo&s;s of his cloak and his cowl; and even this, he &s;ays, he &s;hould have held &s;acred, but he knew whoever &s;hould find the clothes, would make lawful prize of it.</P>
<P>The poor &s;oldier remained next day a &s;pectacle of ridicule to all the world; at la&s;t his companions heard of his &s;trange metamorpho&s;is, and came in troops to &s;ee him: Their jokes were perhaps &s;till more galling than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of the guard, but as he thought him&s;elf under the finger of God, or at lea&s;t of St. Januarius, he bore all with meekne&s;s and patience; at la&s;t his clothes were found, and he was &s;et at liberty; but he be|lieves to this day that the whole was the work of the devil, &s;ent to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his &s;ins; and has never &s;ince &s;een his mi&s;tre&s;s on a Friday, nor pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tat|ue of St. Januarius without muttering a prayer. Fra Pa&s;qual has told the &s;tory to &s;everal of his mo&s;t intimate friends, whom he can depend on, among&s;t whom is the Abb&eacute; T-t-i, who has often had it from his own mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="024150_0263_0FC3D4B28920AF68">I beg pardon for this long &s;tory; had I &s;u&s;pected that it would have run out to half this length, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould not have troubled you with it. Perhaps, however, you will think this apology preci&s;ely the mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary, and mo&s;t impertinent part of it all. This is often the fate of apologies, particularly for long letters; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it always makes them longer; Secondly, Hey-day! where are we going now? To return then to our &s;ubject. We had no &s;ooner left the Capuchin convent, than our carriage, broke down, long before we reached the city: And as walking (at Palermo as well as Naples) is of all things the mo&s;t di&s;graceful, we ri&s;ked by this unfortunate accident to have our characters bla&s;ted for ever. However, Philip, our Sicilian &s;ervant, took care to make &s;uch a noi&s;e about it, that our dignity did not much &s;uffer. He kept a little di&s;tance before us, pe&s;ting and bla&s;ting all the way at their cur&s;ed crazy carriages; and &s;wearing that there never was any thing in the world &s;o infa|mous: That in a city like Palermo, the capital of all Sicily, Signori of our rank and dignity &s;hould be obli|ged to walk on walk; that it mu&s;t be an eternal reflec|tion again&s;t the place, and bawled out to every per&s;on he met, if there was no coaches to be had; no carri|ages of any kind, either for love or money. In &s;hort, we had not got half through the &s;treet, before we had &s;everal offers from gentlemen of our acquaintance, who lamented exceedingly the indignity we had &s;uffer|ed, and wondered much, that we did not rather &s;ond forward a &s;ervant for another coach, and wait (in the heat of the &s;un) 'till it arrived.</P>
<P>This is not the only time that Philip's wits have been of &s;ervice to us on &s;uch occa&s;ions. A few nights ago, we had a di&s;pute with out coachman; turned him off, and had not provided another. We were unfor|tunately

engaged to go to the great conver&s;ation. What was to be done? No &s;uch thing as walking. Should we be caught in the fact, we are di&s;graced for ever. It would be wor&s;e than to be caught in that of adultery. No alternative, however. There was not a coach to be had, and our old coachman would not &s;erve us for one night only. Philip made &s;ad wry fa|ces, and &s;wore the coachman ought to be crucified; but when he &s;aw us bent on walking, he was &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and I really believe, if we had been di&s;cover|ed, that he would not have &s;erved us any longer. He therefore &s;et his wits to work, how he &s;hould pre&s;erve both his ma&s;ter's honour and his own place. He at fir&s;t he&s;itated, before he would take up the flambeau; but he would by no means be prevailed on to light it. <Q>What, (&s;aid Philip) do you think I have no more regard for you, than to expo&s;e you to the eyes of the whole world? No, no, Gentlemen; if you will bring your&s;elves to di&s;grace, you &s;hall at lea&s;t make me the agent of &s;hewing it: But remember, if you are ob&s;erved walking, no mortal will believe you keep a coach; and do you expect after that to be receiv|ed into company?" "Well, well, Philip, do as you plea&s;e, but we mu&s;t go to the conver&s;ation.</Q> Philip &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders. <Q><HI>Diabolo, che faremo! Andiamo dunque Signori, andiamo.</HI></Q> So &s;aying, he led the way, and we followed.</P>
<P>Philip had &s;tudied the geography of the town; he conducted us through lanes only known to him&s;elf, and carefully avoided the great &s;treet; 'till at la&s;t we ar|rived at a little entry, which leads to the conver&s;ation-rooms; here the carriages u&s;ually &s;top. We &s;lipped up the entry in the dark; when Philip, darting into a &s;hop, lighted his flambeau in an in&s;tant, and came ru&s;hing before us, bawling out, <HI>"Piazza per gli Signori for|re&s;tieri;"</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="024150_0265_0FC3D4B947D77DF8">
when all the world immediately made way for us. After we had got into the rooms, he called &s;o loud after us, a&s;king at what time he &s;hould order the coach to return; that, overcome partly by ri&s;i|bility, and partly by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the deceit, not one of us had power to an&s;wer him. Philip, however, followed us, and repeated the que&s;tion &s;o often, that we were obliged to give him a reply, <HI>"a mezzo notte."</HI> At midnight he came to tell us that the coach was ready. We were curious to &s;ee how he would behave on this occa&s;ion; for it was not half &s;o difficult to get in unob&s;erved, as to get out: However, Philip's genius was equal to both. As &s;oon as we got into the entry, he ran to the door, bawling out Antonio as hard as he could roar. No Antonio an&s;wered; and unfortunately, there was a number of gentlemen and ladies going away at the &s;ame time. They begged of us, as stran|gers, to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p fir&s;t into our carriage, and ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed to go out before us. Philip was &s;adly puzzled. He fir&s;t ran up the &s;treet, then he ran down, and came back all out of breath, cur&s;ing Antonio. <Q>That ra&s;|cal (&s;aid he) is never in the way, and you mu&s;t turn him off. He pretends that he could not get up his coach to the door, for the great croud of carriages; and is waiting about fifty yards below.

However, he a&s;&s;ures us, he will not venture it again for his place.</P>

<P>OUR comet is now gone; we fir&s;t ob&s;erved it on the 24th. It had no tail, but was &s;urrounded with a fainti&s;h ill defined light, that made it look like a bright &s;tar &s;hining through a thin cloud. This &s;mall proba|bility, is owing to an atmo&s;phere, around the body of the comet, that cau&s;es a refraction of the rays, and pre|vents them from reaching us with that di&s;tinctne&s;s we ob&s;erve in bodies that have no atmo&s;phere. We were &s;till the more per&s;uaded of this two nights ago, when we had the good fortune to catch the comet ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ing clo&s;e by a &s;mall fixed &s;tar, who&s;e light was not only con|&s;iderably dimmed, but we thought we ob&s;erved a &s;en&s;i|ble change of place in the &s;tar, as &s;oon as its rays felt into the atmo&s;phere of the comet; owing no doubt to the refraction in pa&s;&s;ing through that atmo&s;phere. We at|tempted to trace the line of the comet's cour&s;e, but as we could find no globe, it was not po&s;&s;ible to do it with any degree of preci&s;ion. Its direction was almo&s;t due
<PB N="258" REF="024150_0268_0FC3D4C3690DAC90">
north, and its velocity altogether amazing. We did not ob&s;erve it &s;o minutely the two or three fir&s;t nights of its appearance, but on the 30th it was at our zenith here, (latitude 3&deg; 10&prime;; longitude from Lond. 13&deg;) about five minutes after midnight, and la&s;t night, the fir&s;t of July, it pa&s;&s;ed four degrees to the ea&s;t of the polar &s;tar, nearly at 40 minutes after eight. So that, in le&s;s than 24 hours, it has de&s;cribed a great arch in the heavens; upwards of 50 degrees; which gives an idea of the mo&s;t amazing velocity. Suppo&s;ing it at the di&s;tance of the &s;un, at this rate of travelling, it would go round the earth's orbit in le&s;s than a week. Which makes, I think, con&s;iderably more than &s;ixty millions of miles in a day; a motion that va&s;tly &s;urpa&s;&s;es all human comprehen&s;ion. And as this motion continues to be greatly accelerated, what mu&s;t it be, when the comet approaches &s;till nearer to the body of the &s;un! La&s;t night a change of place was ob&s;ervable in the &s;pace of a few minutes, particularly when it pa&s;&s;ed near any of the fixed &s;tars. We attempted to find if it had any ob&s;ervable parallax, but the va&s;t rapidity of its motion always prevented us; for whatever fixed &s;tars it was in the horizon, it had got &s;o far to the north of them, long before it reached the meridian, that the parallax, if there was any, entirely e&s;caped us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long much to &s;ee the ob&s;ervations that have been made with you, and in other di&s;tant countries, on this comet; as from the&s;e, we &s;hall probably be ena|bled to form &s;ome judgment of its di&s;tance from the earth; which, although we could ob&s;erve no parallax, I am apt to believe was not very great, as its motion was &s;o very perceptible. We could procure no in&s;tru|ments to mea&s;ure its apparent di&s;tance from any of the fixed &s;tars, &s;o that the only two ob&s;ervations any thing can be made of, are, the time of its pa&s;&s;ing the polar &s;tar
<PB N="259" REF="024150_0269_0FC3D4CADA9509D8">
la&s;t night, its di&s;tance from it, and the time of its arri|val at our zenith on the 30th; this we found by apply|ing the eye to a &s;traight rod, hung perpendicularly from a &s;mall thread. The comet was not in the exact point of the zenith, but to the be&s;t of our ob&s;ervation, about &s;ix or &s;even minutes to the north of it. La&s;t night it was vi&s;ible almo&s;t immediately after &s;un&s;et; long before any of the fixed &s;tars appeared. It is now immer&s;ed in the rays of the &s;un, and has certainly got very near his body. If it returns again to the regions of &s;pace, it will probably be vi&s;ible in a few days, but I own I &s;hould much doubt of any &s;uch return, if it is rearlly by the attractive force of the &s;un, that it is at pre&s;ent carried with &s;uch amazing celerity towards him. This is the third comet of this kind, who&s;e return I have had an opportunity of watching; but never was fortunate enough to find any of them after they had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;un; though tho&s;e that do really return, ap|pear at that time much more luminous than before they approached him.</P>
<P>The a&s;tronomy of comets, from what I can remem|ber of it, appears to be clogged with very great diffi|culties, and even &s;ome &s;eeming ab&s;urdities. It is difficult to conceive, that the&s;e immen&s;e bodies, after being drawn to the &s;un with the velocity of a million of miles in an hour; when they have at la&s;t come almo&s;t to touch him, &s;hould then fly off from his body, with the &s;ame velocity they approach it; and that too, by the power of this very motion that this attraction has occa&s;ioned. The demon&s;tration of this I remember is very curious and ingenious; but I wi&s;h it may be entirely free from &s;ophi&s;try. No doubt, in bodies moving in curves round a fixed centre, as the centripe|tal motion increa&s;es, the centrifugal one increa&s;es like|wi&s;e; but how this motion, which is only generated by
<PB N="260" REF="024150_0270_0FC3D4D102EF6F30">
the former, &s;hould at la&s;t get the better of the power that produces it; and that too, at the very time this power has acquired its utmo&s;t force and energy; &s;eems &s;omewhat difficult to conceive. It is the only in&s;tance I know, wherein the effect increa&s;ing regularly with the cau&s;e; at la&s;t, whil&s;t the cau&s;e is &s;till acting with full vigour; the effect entirely gets the better of the cau&s;e, and leaves it in the lurch. For, the body at|tracted, is at la&s;t carried away with infinite velocity from the attracting body. By what power is it carried away? Why, &s;ay our philo&s;ophers, by the very power of this attraction, which has now produced a new pow|er &s;uperior to it&s;elf, to wit, the centrifugal force. However, perhaps, all this may be reconcilable to rea|&s;on; far be it from me to pre&s;ume attacking &s;o glori|ous a &s;y&s;tem as that of attraction. The law that the heavenly bodies are &s;aid to ob&s;erve, in de&s;cribing equal areas in equal times, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be demon&s;trated, and by this it would appear, that the centripetal and centrifugal forces alternately get the ma&s;tery of one another.</P>
<P>However, I cannot help thinking it &s;omewhat hard to conceive, that gravity &s;hould always get the better of the centrifugal force, at the very time that its action is the &s;malle&s;t, when the comet is at its greate&s;t di&s;|tance from the &s;un; and that the centrifugal force &s;hould get the better of gravity, at the very time that its action is the greate&s;t, when the comet is at its near|e&s;t point to the &s;un.</P>
<P>To a common ob&s;erver it would rather appear, that the &s;un, like an electric body, after it had once charged the objects that it attracted with its own effluvia or atmo&s;phere, by degrees lo&s;es its attraction, and at la&s;t even repels them; and, that the attracting power, like
<PB N="261" REF="024150_0271_0FC3D4D206E3C370">
what we likewi&s;e ob&s;erve in electricity, does not re|turn again 'till the effluvia imbibed from the attracting body is di&s;pelled or di&s;&s;ipated; when it is again attract|ed, and &s;o on alternately. For it appears (at lea&s;t to an unphilo&s;ophical ob&s;erver) &s;omewhat repugnant to rea&s;on, to &s;ay that a body flying off from another body &s;ome thou&s;ands of miles in a minute, &s;hould all the time be violently attracted by that body, and that it is even by virtue of this very attraction that it is flying off from it. He would probably a&s;k, What more could it do, pray, were it really to be repelled?</P>
<P>Had the &s;y&s;tem of electricity, and of repul&s;ion as well as attraction, been known and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the la&s;t age, I have little doubt that the profound genius of Newton would have called it to his aid; and perhaps accounted in a more &s;atisfactory manner, for many of the great phaenomena of the heavens. To the be&s;t of my remembrance, we know of no body that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in any con&s;iderable degree, the power of attraction, that in certain circum&s;tances does not likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of repul&s;ion. The magnet, the tourmalin, amber, gla&s;s, and every electrical &s;ub&s;tance. Now from analogy, as we find the &s;un &s;o powerfully endow|ed with attraction, why may we not likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e him to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of repul&s;ion? Indeed, this very power &s;eems to be confe&s;&s;ed by the Newtonians to re&s;ide in the &s;un in a mo&s;t wonderful degree; for they a&s;&s;ure us he repels the rays of light with &s;uch amazing force, that they fly upwards of 80 milions of miles in &s;even minutes. Now why &s;hould we con|fine this repul&s;ion to the rays of light only? As they are material, may not other matter brought near his body, be affected in the &s;ame manner? Indeed one would imagine, that their motion alone would create the mo&s;t violent repul&s;ion; and that the force, with
<PB N="262" REF="024150_0272_0FC3D4D370C2F8A0">
which they are perpetually flowing from the &s;un, would mo&s;t effectually prevent every other body from approaching him; for this we find is the con&s;tant effect of a rapid &s;tream of any other matter.&mdash;But let us examine a little more his effects on comets. The tails of the&s;e bodies, are probably their atom&s;pheres rendered highly electrical, either from the violence of their motion, or from their proximity to the &s;un.&mdash;Of all the bodies we know, there is none in &s;o con&s;tant and &s;o violent an electrical &s;tate, as the higher regions of our own atom&s;phere. Of this I have long been convinced; for, &s;end up a kite with a &s;mall wire about its &s;tring, only to the height of 12 or 1300 feet, and at all times it will produce fire, as I have found by frequent experience; &s;ometimes when the air was perfectly clear, without a cloud in the hemi&s;phere; at other times, when it was thick and hazy, and total|ly unfit for electrical operations below. Now, as this is the ca&s;e at &s;o &s;mall a height, and as we find the effect &s;till grows &s;tronger, in proportion as the kite advances (for I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, that a little bla&s;t of wind, &s;uddenly rai&s;ing the kite about an hundred feet, has more than doubled the effect) what mu&s;t it be in very great elevations?&mdash;Indeed we may often judge of it from the violence with which the clouds are agi|tated, from the meteors formed above the region of the clouds, and particularly from the aurora borealis, which has been ob&s;erved to have much the &s;ame colour and appearance as the matter that forms the tails of comets.</P>
<P>Now what mu&s;t be the effect of &s;o va&s;t a body as our atom&s;phere, made &s;trongly electrical, when it hap|pens to approach any other body? It mu&s;t always be either violently attracted or repelled, according to the po&s;itive or negative quality (in the language of the electricians) of the body that it approaches.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="024150_0273_0FC3D4D509D8EB78">It has ever been ob&s;erved that the tails of comets (ju&s;t as we &s;hould expect, from a very light fluid body, attached to a &s;olid heavy one) are drawn after the com|ets, as long as they are at a di&s;tance from the &s;un; but as &s;oon as the comets get near his body, the tail veers about to that &s;ide of the comet that is in the oppo&s;ite direction from the &s;un, and no longer follows the com|et, but continues its motion &s;ideways, oppo&s;ing its whole length to the medium through which it pa&s;&s;es, rather than allow it in any degree to approach the &s;un. Indeed, its tendency to follow the body of the comet is &s;till ob&s;ervable, were it not prevented by &s;ome force &s;uperior to that tendency; for the tail is always ob&s;er|ved to bend a little to that &s;ide from whence the comet is flying. This perhaps is &s;ome proof too, that it does not move in an ab&s;olute vacuum.</P>
<P>When the comet reaches its perihelion, the tail is generally very much lengthened, perhaps by the rare|faction from the heat; perhaps by the increa&s;e of the &s;un's repul&s;ion, or that of his atom&s;phere. It &s;till con|tinues projected, exactly in the oppo&s;ite direction from the &s;un; and when the comet moves off again to the regions of &s;pace, the tail, in&s;tead of following it, as it did on its approach, is projected a va&s;t way before it, and &s;till keeps the body of the comet exactly oppo&s;ed betwixt it and the &s;un; 'till by degrees, as the di&s;tance increa&s;es, the length of the tail is dimini&s;hed; the repul&s;ion probably becoming weaker and weaker.</P>
<P>It has likewi&s;e been ob&s;erved, that the length of the&s;e tails are commonly in proportion to the proxim|ity of the comet to the &s;un. That of 1680 threw out a train that would almo&s;t have reached from the &s;un to the earth. If this had been attracted by the &s;un, would it not have fallen upon his body? When the
<PB N="264" REF="024150_0274_0FC3D4DA484779F0">
comet at that time was not one-fourth of his diameter di&s;tant from him; but in&s;tead of this, it was darted away to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the heavens, even with a greater velocity than that of the comet it&s;elf.&mdash;Now what can this be owing to, if not to a repul&s;ive power in the &s;un, or his atmo&s;phere?</P>
<P>And, indeed, it would at fir&s;t appear but little le&s;s ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that the tail of the comet is all this time violently attracted by the &s;un, although it be driven away in an oppo&s;ite direction from him, as to &s;ay the &s;ame of the comet it&s;elf. It is true, this repul&s;ion &s;eems to begin much &s;ooner to affect the tail, than the body of the comet; which is &s;uppo&s;ed always to pa&s;s the &s;un before it begins to fly away from him, which is by no means the ca&s;e with the tail. The repul&s;ive force, therefore (if there is any &s;uch) is in a much le&s;s propor|tion than the attractive one, and probably ju&s;t only enough to counterbalance the latter, when the&s;e bodies are in their perihelions, and to turn them &s;o much a&s;ide, as to prevent their falling into the body of the &s;un. The projectile force they have acquired will then carry them out to the heavens, and repul&s;ion prob|ably dimini&s;hing as they recede from the &s;un's atmo|&s;phere, his attraction will again take place, and retard their motion regularly, 'till they arrive at their aphelia, when they once more begin to return to him.</P>
<P>I don't know how you will like all this:&mdash;Our comet has led me a dance I very little thought of; and I believe I &s;hould have done better to &s;end it at once into the &s;un, and had done with it: And that, indeed, I am apt to believe, will be its fate. For as this comet has no tail, there is, of con&s;equence, no ap|parent repul&s;ion. If it was repelled, its atmo&s;phere, like the others, would be driven away in the oppo&s;ite
<PB N="265" REF="024150_0275_0FC3D4DBEB44E398">
direction from the &s;un; I therefore do not &s;ee any po&s;|&s;ible method it has of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>The&s;e comets are certainly bodies of a very differ|ent nature from tho&s;e with tails, to which indeed they appear even to bear a much le&s;s re&s;emblance than they do to planets: And it is no &s;mall proof of the little progre&s;s we have made in the knowledge of the univer&s;e, that they have not as yet been di&s;tingui&s;hed by a different name.</P>
<P>This is the third kind of body that has been di&s;cov|ered in our &s;y&s;tem, that all appear e&s;&s;entially different from each other, that are probably regulated by differ|ent laws, and intended for very different purpo&s;es. How much will po&s;terity be a&s;toni&s;hed at our ignorance, and wonder that this &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould have exi&s;ted for &s;o many thou&s;and years, before we were in the lea&s;t acquainted with one half of it, or had even invented names to di&s;tingui&s;h its different members!</P>
<P>I have do doubt, that in future ages, the number of the comets, the form of their orbits, and time of their revolutions, will be as clearly demon&s;trated as that of the planets. It is our countryman, Dr. Halley, who has begun this great work, which may be con&s;id|ered ju&s;t now as in its earlie&s;t infancy. The&s;e bodies too, with thick atmo&s;pheres, but without tails, will likewi&s;e have their proper places a&s;certained, and will no longer be confounded with bodies to which they bear no re&s;emblance or connection.</P>
<P>Comets with tails have &s;eldom been vi&s;ible, but on their rece&s;s from the &s;un. It is he that kindles them up, and gives them that alarming appearance in the heavens. On the contrary, tho&s;e without tails have &s;eldom, perhaps never, been ob&s;erved, but on their ap|proach

to him. I don't recollect any who&s;e return has been tolerably well a&s;certained. I remember, in|deed, a few years ago, a &s;mall one, that was &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by a tele&s;cope, after it had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;un, but never more became vi&s;ible to the naked eye. This a&s;&s;ertion is ea&s;ily made, and nobody can contradict it; but it does not at all appear probable, that it &s;hould have been &s;o much le&s;s luminous after it had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;un, than before it approached him; and I will own to you, when I have heard that the return of the&s;e comets had e&s;caped the eyes of the mo&s;t acute a&s;tronomers, I have been tempted to think, that they did not return at all, but were ab&s;orbed in the body of the &s;un, which their violent motion towards him &s;eem|ed to indicate. Indeed, I have often wi&s;hed that this di&s;covery might be made, as it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for what has as yet been looked upon as unac|countable: That the &s;un, notwith&s;tanding his daily wa&s;te, from enlightening the univer&s;e, never appears dimini&s;hed either in &s;ize or light. Surely this wa&s;te mu&s;t be immen&s;e, and were there not in nature &s;ome hidden provi&s;on for &s;upplying it, in the &s;pace of &s;ix thou&s;and years, &s;uppo&s;ing the world to be no older, the planets mu&s;t have got to a much greater di&s;tance from his body, by the va&s;t diminution of his attraction; they mu&s;t likewi&s;e have moved much flower, and con|&s;equently the length of our year mu&s;t have been great|ly increa&s;ed. Nothing of all this &s;eems to be the ca&s;e: The diameter of the &s;un is the &s;ame that ever it was: He neither appears dimini&s;hed, nor our di&s;tance from him increa&s;ed: His light, heat, and attraction &s;eem to be the &s;ame as ever; and the motion of the planets round him is performed in the &s;ame time; of con&s;e|quence, his quantity of matter &s;till continues the &s;ame. How then is this va&s;t wa&s;te &s;upplied? May there not be millions of bodies attracted by him, from the bound|le&s;s
<PB N="267" REF="024150_0277_0FC3D4E2CC5DA258">
regions of &s;pace, that are never perceived by us? Comets, on their road to him, have &s;everal times been accidentally di&s;covered by tele&s;copes, that were never &s;een by the naked eye. Indeed the number of black &s;pots on the &s;un &s;eem to indicate that there is always a quantity of matter there, only in a preparation to give light, but not yet refined and pure enough to throw off rays like the re&s;t of his body. For I think we can hardly conceive, that any matter can remain long on the body of the &s;un without becoming luminous; and &s;o we find the&s;e &s;pots often di&s;appear, that is to &s;ay, the matter of which they are compo&s;ed is then perfectly melted, and has acquired the &s;ame degree of heat and light as the re&s;t of his body. Even in our gla&s;s-hou&s;es, and other very hot furnaces, mo&s;t &s;orts of matter very &s;oon acquire the &s;ame colour and appearance as the matter in fu&s;ion, and emit rays of light like it. But how much more mu&s;t this be the ca&s;e at the &s;urface of the &s;un! when Newton computes, that even at many thou&s;and miles di&s;tance from it, a body would acquire a degree of heat two thou&s;and times greater than that of red hot iron. It has generally been under&s;tood, that he &s;aid the great comet really did acquire this degree of heat; but this is certainly a mi&s;take: Sir I&s;aac's ex|pre&s;&s;ion, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, is, that it might have acquired it. And if we con&s;ider the very great &s;ize of that body, and the &s;hort time of its peri|helion, the thing will appear impo&s;&s;ible: Nor indeed do I think we can conceive, that a body only as large as our earth, and the &s;pots on the &s;un are often much larger, could be reduced to fu&s;ion, even on his &s;urface, but after a very con&s;iderable &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>Now as it &s;eems to be univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the rays of light are really particles of matter, proceed|ing from the body of the &s;un, I think it is ab&s;olutely
<PB N="268" REF="024150_0278_0FC3D4E3F67F33D0">
nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould fall upon &s;ome &s;uch method of &s;ending him back a &s;upply of tho&s;e rays, otherwi&s;e, let his &s;tock be ever &s;o great, it mu&s;t at la&s;t be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h a&s;tronomers would ob&s;erve whether the &s;pots on the &s;un are not increa&s;ed after the appearing of the&s;e comets; and whether the&s;e &s;pots do not di&s;appear again by degrees, like a body that is gradually melted down in a furnace. But there is another con&s;ideration too, which naturally occurs: Pray what becomes of all this va&s;t quantity of matter after it is reduced to light? Is it ever collected again into &s;olid bodies; or is it for ever lo&s;t and di&s;&s;ipated, after it has made its journey from the &s;un to the object it illuminates? It is &s;ome|what &s;trange, that of all that immen&s;e quantity of matter poured down on us during the day, that pervades and fills the whole univer&s;e; the moment we are deprived of the luminous body, the whole of it, in an in&s;tant, &s;eems to be annihilated: In &s;hort, there are a number of difficulties attending the common received doctrine of light; nor do I think there is any point in natural philo&s;ophy the &s;olution of which is le&s;s &s;atisfacto|ry. If we &s;uppo&s;e every ray to be a &s;tream of particles of matter; darting from the luminous body, how can we conceive that the&s;e &s;treams may be inter&s;ected and pierced by other &s;treams of the &s;ame matter ten thou&s;and different ways, without cau&s;ing the lea&s;t con|fu&s;ion either to the one or the other? For in a clear night we &s;ee di&s;tinctly any particular &s;tar that we look at, although the rays coming from that &s;tar to our eye is pierced for millions of miles before it reaches us by millions of &s;treams of the &s;ame rays, from every other &s;un and &s;tar in the univer&s;e. Now &s;uppo&s;e, in any other matter that we know of, and one would imagine there ought at lea&s;t to be &s;ome &s;ort of analogy; &s;uppose, I &s;ay, we &s;hould only attempt to make two &s;treams pa&s;s
<PB N="269" REF="024150_0279_0FC3D4E9B50E0800">
one another; water, for in&s;tance, or air, one of the pure&s;t and the mo&s;t fluid sub&s;tances we are acquainted with, we find it totally impo&s;&s;ible. The two &s;treams will mutually interrupt and incommode one another, and the &s;tronge&s;t will ever carry off the weake&s;t into its own direction; but if a &s;tream of light is hit by ten thou&s;and other &s;treams, moving at the rate of ten millions of miles in a minute, it is not even bent by the impre&s;&s;ion, nor in the &s;malle&s;t degree diverted from its cour&s;e; but reaches us with the &s;ame preci&s;ion and regularity, as if nothing had interfered with it. Be|&s;ides, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that light is real particles of matter moving from the &s;un to the earth, in the &s;pace of &s;even minutes, how comes it to pa&s;s, that with all this wonderful velocity, there &s;eems to be no momen|tum! for it communicates motion to no body that ob&s;tructs its pa&s;&s;age, and no body whatever is removed by the percu&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;ing we had never heard of this di&s;covery, and were at once to be told of a current of matter flying at the rate of ten millions of miles in a minute, and &s;o large as to cover one half of our globe, would we not imagine that the earth mu&s;t in&s;tantly be torn to pieces by it, or carried off with the mo&s;t incred|ible velocity! it will be objected, that the extreme minutene&s;s of the particles of light prevents it from having any &s;uch effect; but as the&s;e particles are in &s;uch quantity, and &s;o clo&s;e to each other as to cover the &s;urface of every body that is oppo&s;ed to them, and entirely to fill up that va&s;t &s;pace betwixt the earth and the &s;un, this objection I &s;hould think in a great mea|&s;ure falls to the ground. The particles of air and of water are likewi&s;e extremely minute, and a &s;mall quantity of the&s;e will produce little or no effect, but increase their number, and only give them the millionth part of the velocity that is a&s;cribed to a ray of light, and no force whatever could be able to with&s;tand them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Palermo,</HI> <DATE><HI>July 6th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MANY of the churches here are extremely rich and magnificent. The cathedral (or, as they call it, <HI>Madre Chie&s;a</HI>) is a venerable Gothic building, and of a large &s;ize; it is &s;upported within by eighty columns of Oriental granite, and divided into a great number of chapels, &s;ome of which are extremely rich, particular|ly that of St. Ro&s;olia, the patrone&s;s of Palermo, who is held in greater veneration here, than all the per&s;ons of the Trinity; and, which is &s;till much more than even the Virgin Mary her&s;elf. The relics of the &s;aint are pre|&s;erved in a large box of &s;ilver, curiou&s;ly wrought, and enriched with precious &s;tones. They perform many miracles, and are looked upon as the greate&s;t trea&s;ure of the city. They are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t effectual remedy again&s;t the plague, and have often pre&s;erved them from that fatal di&s;temper. The &s;aint gained &s;o much credit, in &s;aving them from the la&s;t plague of Me&s;&s;ina, although it was at two hundred miles di&s;tance, that they have, out of gratitude, erected a noble monu|ment to her.&mdash;St. Agatha did as much for Catania, but that city has not been &s;o generous to her. The other riches of this church con&s;i&s;t principally in &s;ome bones of St. Peter, and a whole arm of St. John the Bapti&s;t. There is likewi&s;e a jaw-bone of prodigious efficacy; and &s;ome other bones of left note. It contains &s;ome things of &s;maller con&s;equence, which, however, are not altogether without their merit. The monuments of their Norman kings, &s;everal of whom lie buried here, are of the fine&s;t porphyry, &s;ome of
<PB N="272" REF="024150_0282_0FC3D4EDC187BD28">
them near &s;even hundred years old, and yet of very tolerable workman&s;hip. Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e, there is a tabernacle of lapis lazuli. It is about fifteen feet high, and finely ornamented. Some of the pre&s;ents made to St. Ro&s;olia, are by no means contemptible. A cro&s;s of very large brilliants, from the king of Spain, is, I think, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Sachri&s;tie too is very rich: there are &s;ome robes embroidered with Oriental pearl, that are near four hundred years old, and yet look as fre&s;h as if done ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits church is equal in magnificence to any thing I have &s;een in Italy. The genius of tho&s;e fathers appears &s;trong in all their works; one is never at a lo&s;s to find then out. They have been gro&s;sly calumnia|ted; for they certainly had le&s;s hypocri&s;y than any other order of monks.</P>
<P>The Chie&s;a del Pallazzo is entirely encru&s;ted over with ancient mo&s;aic; and the vaulted roof too is all of the &s;ame. But it is endle&s;s to talk of churches. Here are upwards of three hundred. That of Monreale, about five miles di&s;tant from this city, is the next in dig|nity in the i&s;land, after the cathedral of Palermo. It is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, and the whole is encru&s;ted with mo&s;aic, at an incredible expen&s;e. Here are like|wi&s;e &s;everal porphyry and marble monuments of the fir&s;t kings of Sicily. This cathedral was built by King William the Good, who&s;e memory is &s;till held in great veneration among&s;t the Sicilians.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop of Monreale, is already looked upon as a &s;aint, and indeed he de&s;erves beatification better, I believe, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e in the calendar. His in|come
<PB N="273" REF="024150_0283_0FC3D4F3171170F8">
is very great, of which he re&s;erves to him&s;elf as much as procures him clothes, and the &s;imple&s;t kind of food; all the re&s;t he devotes to charitable, pious, and public u&s;es. He even &s;eems to carry this too far, and denies him&s;elf the common gratifications of life; &s;uch as &s;leeping on a bed; a piece of luxury he is &s;aid never to indulge him&s;elf in, but lies every night on &s;traw. He is, as you may believe, adored by the people, who crowd in his way as he pa&s;&s;es, to receive his benedic|tion; which they alledge is even of more &s;overeign efficacy than that of the pope. And indeed &s;o it is, for he never &s;ees an object in di&s;tre&s;s, but he is &s;ure to relieve him; not tru&s;ting alone to the &s;piritual efficacy of the ble&s;&s;ing, but always accompanying it with &s;ome|thing &s;olid and temporal; and perhaps this accompani|ment is not e&s;teemed the wor&s;t part of it. The town and country round Monreale are greatly indebted to his liberality; and in every corner exhibit marks of his munificence. He has just now made a pre&s;ent to the cathedral of a magnificent altar; only about one half of which is fini&s;hed. It is of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver, ex|qui&s;itely wrought, repre&s;enting in high relief, &s;ome of the principal &s;tories in the Bible, and, I think, will be one of the fine&s;t in the world. But what is of much greater utility, he has at his own expence made a no|ble walk the whole way from this city to Monreale, which was formerly of very difficult acce&s;s, as it &s;tands near the top of a pretty high mountain. The walk is cut with a great deal of judgment on the &s;ide of this mountain, and winds by ea&s;y zig-zags to the top of it. It is adorned with &s;everal elegant fountains of water, and is bordered on each &s;ide with a variety of flowering &s;hrubs. The valley at the foot of the mountain is rich and beautiful. It appears one continued orange gar|den for many miles, and exhibits an elegant piece of &s;cenery; perfuming the air at the &s;ame time with the
<PB N="274" REF="024150_0284_0FC3D4F48847B0A0">
mo&s;t delicious odours. We were &s;o plea&s;ed with this little expedition, that notwith&s;tanding the heat of the &s;ea&s;on, we could not keep in our carriage, but walked almo&s;t the whole of it.</P>
<P>The city of Palermo for the&s;e ten days pa&s;t has been wholly occupied in preparing for the great fea&s;t of St. Ro&s;olia. And if the &s;how is in any degree ade|quate to the expence and trouble it co&s;ts them, it mu&s;t indeed be a very noble one. They are erecting an incredible number of arches and pyramids for the illu|minations. They are of wood; painted, and adorned with artificial flowers. The&s;e, they tell us, are to be entirely covered over with &s;mall lamps; &s;o that when &s;een at a little di&s;tance, they appear like &s;o many pyra|mids and arches of flame. The whole Marino, and the two great &s;treets that divide the city, are to be illuminated in this magnificent manner. The number of pyramids and arches prepared for the&s;e illuminations, we are told, exceeds two thou&s;and. They are erected on each &s;ide of the &s;treet, betwixt the foot-path and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and run in two right lines exactly parallel from end to end. Each of the&s;e lines is a mile in length, which makes four miles for the whole. The four gates are the vi&s;tas to the&s;e four &s;treets, and are to be highly decorated and illuminated. From the &s;quare in the centre of the city, the whole of this va&s;t illumin|ation can be &s;een at once; and they a&s;&s;ure us the gran|deur of it exceeds all belief. The whole of the Mari|no is to be dre&s;&s;ed out in the &s;ame manner; and for the&s;e three weeks pa&s;t, they have been employed in erecting two great theatres for fireworks. One of the&s;e fronts the viceroy's palace, and is almo&s;t equal to it in &s;ize. The other is laid on piles driven in the &s;ea, exactly oppo&s;ite to the great orche&s;tra in the cen|tre of the Marino. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they are building
<PB N="275" REF="024150_0285_0FC3D4F5F5CC81B8">
an enormous engine, which they call St. Ro&s;olia's triumphal car. From the &s;ize of it, one would imag|ine it were for ever to remain in the &s;pot where it is erected; but they a&s;&s;ure us, it is to be drawn in triumph through the city. It is indeed mounted upon wheels, but it does not appear that any force whatever can be able to turn them.</P>
<P>I own my curio&s;ity increa&s;es every day to &s;ee this &s;ingular exhibition. The car is already higher than mo&s;t hou&s;es in Palermo, and they are &s;till adding to its height. But the part of the &s;how they value them|&s;elves the mo&s;t on, is the illumination of the great church; this they affirm is &s;uperior to any thing in the world; the illumination of St. Peter's it&s;elf not excep|ted. The preparations for it, are indeed amazing. The&s;e were begun about a month ago, and will not be fini&s;hed 'till towards the la&s;t days of the fea&s;t. The whole of the cathedral, both roof and walls, is entirely covered over with mirrour, intermixed with gold and &s;ilver paper, and an infinite variety of artificial flowers. All the&s;e are arranged and di&s;po&s;ed, in my opinion, with great ta&s;te and elegance; none of them predominate, but they are intermingled every where in a ju&s;t pro|portion.</P>
<P>Every altar, chapel, and column are fini&s;hed in the &s;ame manner, which takes off from the littlene&s;s of the particular ornaments, and gives an air of grandeur and uniformity to the whole. The roof is hung with innumerable lu&s;tres filled with wax candles, and I am per&s;uaded, when the whole is lighted up, it mu&s;t be equal to any palace either in the Fairy Tales or the Arabian Nights Entertainment. Indeed it &s;eems pretty much in the &s;ame &s;tile too, for all is gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones. The &s;aints are dre&s;&s;ed out in all
<PB N="276" REF="024150_0286_0FC3D4F772366E60">
their glory, and die fairy queen her&s;elf was never finer than is St. Ro&s;olia. The people are lying yonder in crowds before her, praying with all their might. I dare &s;ay, for one petition offered to God Almighty, &s;he has at lea&s;t an hundred.</P>
<P>We were ju&s;t now remarking, with how little re&s;|pect they pa&s;s the chapels dedicated to God; they hardly deign to give a little inclination of the head; but when they come near tho&s;e of their favourite &s;aints, they bow down to the very ground: Ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition have ever been in&s;eparable: I believe in their hearts they think he has already reigned long enough; and would be glad to have a change in the government: And every one of them (like the poor Welchman who thought he &s;hould be &s;ucceeded by Sir Watkin Williams) is fully per&s;uaded, that his own favour|ite &s;aint is the true heir apparent. Indeed they already give them the precedency on mo&s;t occa&s;ions; not in proce&s;&s;ions and affairs of etiquette; there they think it would not be decent; but, in their more private affairs, they generally pay the compliment to the &s;aint: Yet in their in&s;criptions on churches and chapels, (which one would think are public enough) when they are dedicated to God and any particular &s;aint, they have often ventured to put the name of the &s;aint fir&s;t. Sanc|to Januario, et Deo Opt. Max. taking every opportu|nity of rai&s;ing their dignity, though at the expence of that of God him&s;elf.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Palermo,</HI> <DATE><HI>July 7th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been enquiring who this fame St. Ro&s;olia may be, who has become &s;o very capital a per&s;onage
<PB N="277" REF="024150_0287_0FC3D4FCCC37DE60">
in this part of the world; but, notwith&s;tanding their adoring her with &s;uch fervency, I have found none that can give any tolerable account of her &s;aint&s;hip. They refer you to the mo&s;t fabulous legends, that even differ widely in their accounts of her. And, after all the offerings they have made, the churches they have built, and monuments they have rai&s;ed to her memory, I think it is far from being improbable, that there really never did exi&s;t &s;uch a per&s;on. I went through all the book|&s;ellers &s;hops, but could find nothing relative to her, except an epic poem, of which &s;he is the heroine. It is in the Sicilian language; and is indeed one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities I have met with. The poet &s;ets her at once above all other &s;aints except the Virgin, and it &s;eems to be with the greate&s;t reluctance, that he can prevail upon him&s;elf to yield the pas even to her. I find, from this curious compo&s;ition, and the notes upon it, that St. Ro&s;olia was niece to King William the Good. That &s;he began very early to di&s;play &s;ymp|toms of her &s;anctity. That at fifteen &s;he de&s;erted the world and di&s;claimed all human &s;ociety. She retired to the mountains on the we&s;t of this city&punc; and was never heard of for about five hundred years. She di&s;|appeared in the year 1159. The people thought &s;he had been taken up to heaven; 'till in the year 1624, during the time of a dreadful plague, a holy man had a vi&s;ion, that the &s;aint's bones were lying in a ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e near the top of the Monte Pelegrino. That if they were taken up with due reverence, and carried in proce&s;&s;ion thrice round the walls of the city, they &s;hould imme|diately be delivered from the plague. At fir&s;t little attention was paid to the holy man, and he was looked upon as little better than a dreamer; however, he per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;tory, grew noi&s;y, and got adherents. The magi&s;trates, to pacify them, &s;ent to the Monte Pelegrino; when lo the mighty di&s;covery was made!
<PB N="278" REF="024150_0288_0FC3D501F065F808">
the &s;acred bones were found, the city was freed from the plague, and St. Ro&s;olia became the greate&s;t &s;aint in the calendar. Churches were reared, altars were dedica|ted, and mini&s;ters appointed to this new divinity, who&s;e dignity and con&s;equence have ever &s;ince been &s;upported at an incredible expence. Now I think it is more than probable that the&s;e bones, that are now &s;o much reverenced, and about which this great city is at pre&s;|ent in &s;uch a bu&s;tle, belong to &s;ome poor wretch that perhaps was murdered, or died for want in the moun|tains. The holy man probably could have given a very good account of them.</P>
<P>It is really a&s;toni&s;hing to think, what animals &s;uper|&s;tition makes of mankind. I dare &s;ay, the bones of St. Ro&s;olia are ju&s;t as little entitled to the honours they receive, as tho&s;e of poor <HI>St. Viar,</HI> which were found &s;omewhere in Spain under a broken tomb-&s;tone, where the&s;e were the only legible letters. The &s;tory I think, is told by Dr. Middleton. The prie&s;ts found that the bones had an excellent knack at working mir|acles, and were of opinion that this, together with the <HI>S. Viar</HI> on the &s;tone, was proof &s;ufficient of his &s;anc|tity. He continued long in high e&s;timation, and they drew no incon&s;iderable revenue from his abilities; 'till unfortunately they petitioned the pope to grant him &s;ome immunities. The pope (Leo the tenth, I think,) not entirely &s;atisfied with regard to his &s;aint&s;hip, de|&s;ired to be informed of his preten&s;ions. A li&s;t of his miracles was &s;ent over, accompanied by the &s;tone with <HI>S. Viar</HI> upon it. The fir&s;t part of the proof was &s;u&s;|tained; but the antiquaries di&s;covered the fragment to be part of the tomb-&s;tone of a (Roman) <HI>praefectus viarum,</HI> or over&s;eer of the high road; to who&s;e bones they had been &s;o much indebted: and poor St. Vair, though probably an hone&s;ter man than mo&s;t of them, was ordered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;truck out of the calendar.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="024150_0289_0FC3D502B45041F8">The people of fa&s;hion here hold the &s;uper&s;tition of the vulgar in great contempt; and perhaps that very &s;uper&s;tition is one principal cau&s;e of their infidelity. Indeed I have ever found, that dei&s;m is mo&s;t prevalent in tho&s;e countries where the people are the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t bigotted. A refined and cultivated under&s;tand|ing, &s;hocked at their folly, thinks it cannot po&s;&s;ibly recede too far from it, and is often tempted to fly to the very oppo&s;ite extreme. When rea&s;on is much offended by any particular dogma of faith or act of wor&s;hip, &s;he is but too apt, in the mid&s;t of her di&s;gu&s;t, to reject the whole. The great misfortune is, that, in the&s;e countries, the mo&s;t violent champions for religion are commonly the mo&s;t weak and ignorant; and cer|tainly, one weak advocate in any cau&s;e, but more par|ticularly in a my&s;terious one, that requires to be han|dled with delicacy and addre&s;s, is capable of hurting it more, than fifty of its warme&s;t opponents. Silly books, that have been written by weak well-meaning men, in defence of religion, I am confident have made more infidels than all the works of Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;bury, or even Voltaire him&s;elf: They only want to make people believe that there are &s;ome ludicrous things to be &s;aid again&s;t it; but the&s;e grave plodding blockheads do all they can to per&s;uade us that there is little to be &s;aid for it. The univer&s;al error of the&s;e gentry, is that they ever attempt to explain, and reconcile to &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on tho&s;e very my&s;teries that the fir&s;t principles of our religion teach us are incomprehen&s;ible; and of con&s;equence neither objects of &s;en&s;e nor rea&s;on. I once heard an ignorant prie&s;t declare, that he did not find the lea&s;t difficulty, in conceiving the my&s;tery of the Trinity, or that of incarnation; and that he would undertake to make them plain to the meane&s;t capacities. A gentlemen pre&s;ent told him, he had no doubt he could, to all &s;uch capacities as his

own. The prie&s;t took it as a compliment, and made him a bow. Now, don't you think, that a few &s;uch teachers as this, mu&s;t hurt religion more by their zeal, than all its opponents can by their wit? Had the&s;e heroes &s;till kept behind the bulwarks of faith and of my&s;|tery, their adver&s;aries never could have touched them; but they have been fooli&s;h enough to abandon the&s;e &s;trong holds; and dared them forth to combat on the plain fields of rea&s;on and of &s;en&s;e. A &s;ad piece of general&s;hip indeed: Such defenders mu&s;t ever ruin the be&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But although the people of education here de&s;pi&s;e the wild &s;uper&s;tition of the vulgar, yet they regularly go to ma&s;s, and attend die ordinances with great re&s;pect and decency; and they are much plea&s;ed with us for our conformity to their cu&s;toms, and for not appearing openly to de&s;pi&s;e their rites and ceremonies. I own, this attention of theirs, not to offend weak minds, tends much to give us a favourable opinion both of their hearts and under&s;tandings. They don't make any boa&s;t of their infidelity; neither do they pe&s;ter you with it as in France, where it is perpetually buzz'd in your ears; and where, although they pretend to believe le&s;s, they do in fact believe more than any nation on the continent.</P>
<P>I know of nothing that gives one a wor&s;e opinion of a man, than to &s;ee him make a &s;hew and parade of his contempt for things held &s;acred: It is an open in&s;ult to the judgment of the public.

<P>ON &s;unday, the 8th, we had the long expected &s;irocc wind, which, although our expectations, had been rai&s;ed pretty high, yet I own it greatly exceed|ed them. Ever &s;ince we came to our new lodging, the thermometer has &s;tood betwixt 72 and 74; at our old one, it was often at 79 and 80; &s;o great is the difference betwixt the heart of the city and the &s;ea-&s;hore. At pre&s;ent, our windows not only front to the north,
<PB N="282" REF="024150_0292_0FC3D508F98B00B8">
but the &s;ea is immediately under them, from whence we are con&s;tantly refre&s;hed by a delightful cooling breeze. Friday and Saturday were uncommonly cool, the mercury never being higher than 72&frac12;; and although the &s;irocc is &s;aid to have &s;et in early on Sun|day morning, the air in our apartments, which are very large, with high cielings, was not in the lea&s;t affected by it at eight o'clock, when I ro&s;e. I opened the door without having any &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch a change; and indeed I never was more a&s;toni&s;hed in my life. The fir&s;t bla&s;t of it on my face felt like the burning &s;team from the mouth of an oven. I drew back my head and &s;hut the door, calling out to Fullarton, that the whole atmo&s;phere was in a flame. However, we ventured to open another door that leads leads to a cool platform where we u&s;ually walk; this was not expo&s;ed to the wind; and here I found the heat much more &s;upporta|ble than I could have expected from from the fir&s;t &s;peci|men I had of it at the other door. It felt &s;omewhat like the &s;ubterraneous &s;weating &s;toves at Naples; but &s;till much hotter. In a few minutes we found every fibre greatly relaxed, and the pores opened to &s;uch a degree, that we expected &s;oon to be thrown into a profu&s;e &s;weat. I went to examine the thermometer, and found the air in the room as yet &s;o little affected, that it &s;tood only at 73. The preceding night it was at 72&frac12;. I took it out to the open air, when it imme|diately ro&s;e to 110, and &s;oon after to 112; and I am confident, that in our old lodgings, or any where within the city, it mu&s;t have ri&s;en &s;everal degrees higher. The air was thick and heavy, but the barometer was little affected; it had fallen only about a line. The &s;un did not once appear the whole day, otherwi&s;e I am per|&s;uaded the heat mu&s;t have been in&s;upportable; on that &s;ide of our platform which is expo&s;ed to the wind, it was with difficulty we could bear it for a few minutes.
<PB N="283" REF="024150_0293_0FC3D514CE8502B0">
Here I expo&s;ed a little pomatum which was melted down, as if I had laid it before the fire. I attempted to take a walk in the &s;treet, to &s;ee if any creature was &s;tirring, but I found it too much for me, and was glad to get up &s;tairs again.</P>
<P>This extraordinary heat continued till 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind changed at once, almo&s;t to the oppo&s;ite point of the compa&s;s, and all the re&s;t of the day it blew &s;trong from the &s;ea. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the different feeling of the air. Indeed, the &s;udden change from heat to cold is almo&s;t as inconceiv|able as that from cold to heat. The current of this hot air had been flying for many hours from &s;outh to north; and I had no doubt, that the atmo&s;phere, many for miles round, was entirely compo&s;ed of it; however, the wind no &s;ooner changed to the North, than it felt extremely cold, and we were &s;oon obliged to put on our clothes, for 'till then we had been almo&s;t naked. In a &s;hort time the thermometer &s;unk to 82, a degree of heat that in England would be thought almo&s;t in&s;upportable, and yet all that night we were obliged, merely from the cold, to keep up the gla&s;&s;es of our coach; &s;o much were the pores opened and the fibres relaxed by the&s;e few hours of the &s;irocc. Indeed, I had expo&s;ed my&s;elf a good deal to the open air, as I was determined to feel what effect it would produce on the human body. At fir&s;t I thought it mu&s;t have been impo&s;&s;ible to bear it; but I &s;oon di&s;covered my mi&s;take, and found, that where I was &s;heltered from the wind, I could walk about without any great inconveniency; neither did it pro|duce that copious &s;weat expected; it occa&s;ioned in|deed a violent per&s;piration, which was only attended with a &s;light moi&s;ture on the &s;kin; but I &s;uppo&s;e, if I had put on my clothes, or taken the lea&s;t exerci&s;e, it &s;oon would have brought it on.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="024150_0294_0FC3D51AF4B360F8">I own to you my curio&s;ity with regard to the &s;irocc is now thoroughly &s;ati&s;fied; nor do I at all wi&s;h for another vi&s;it of it during our &s;tay in Sicily. Many of our acquaintance who had been promi&s;ing us this <HI>regalo,</HI> as they call it, came crowding about us as &s;oon as it was over, to know what we thought of it. They own it has been pretty violent for the time it la&s;ted; but a&s;&s;ure us they have felt it more &s;o, and likewi&s;e of a much longer duration; however, it &s;eldom la&s;ts more than thirty-&s;ix or forty hours, &s;o that the walls of the hou&s;es have not time to be heated throughout, otherwi&s;e they think there could be no &s;uch thing as living: However, from what I felt of it, I believe they are mi&s;taken. Indeed, had I been &s;atisfied with the fir&s;t bla&s;t (which is generally the ca&s;e with them) and never more ventured out in it, I certainly &s;hould have been of their opinion. They laughed at us for expo|&s;ing our&s;elves &s;o long to it; and were &s;urpri&s;ed that our curio&s;ity &s;hould lead us to make experiments at the expen&s;e of our per&s;ons. They a&s;&s;ure us, that du|ring the time it la&s;ts, there is not a mortal to be &s;een without doors, but tho&s;e whom nece&s;&s;ity obliges. All their doors and windows are &s;hut clo&s;e, to prevent the external air from entering; and where there are no window-&s;hutters, they hang up wet blankets on the in&s;ide of the window. The &s;ervants are con&s;tantly employed in &s;prinkling water through their apartments, to pre&s;erve the air in as temperate a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible; and this is no difficult matter here, as I am told there is not a hou&s;e in the city that has not a fountain within it. By the&s;e means the people of fa&s;hion &s;uffer very little from the &s;irocc, except the &s;trict confinement to which it obliges them.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;corching heat of this wind it has never been known
<PB N="285" REF="024150_0295_0FC3D51C2EEEA218">
to produce any epidemical di&s;tempers, nor indeed bad con&s;equences of any kind to the health of the people. It is true, they feel extremely weak and relaxed during the time it blows, but a few hours of the Tramontane, or North wind, which generally &s;ucceeds it, &s;oon bra|ces them up, and &s;ets them to rights again. Now, in Naples, and in many other places in Italy, where its vio|lence is not to be compared to this, it is often attended with putrid di&s;orders, and &s;eldom fails to produce a general dejection of &s;pirits. It is true, indeed, that there the &s;irocc la&s;ts for many days, nay, even for weeks; &s;o that, as its effects are different, it probably proceeds likewi&s;e from a different cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I have not been able to procure any good account of this very &s;ingular object in the climate of Palermo. The caufes they a&s;&s;ign for it are various, though none of them, I think, altogether &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>I have &s;een an old fellow here, who has written upon it. He &s;ays it is the &s;ame wind that is &s;o dreadful in the &s;andy de&s;arts of Africa, where it &s;ometimes proves mortal in the &s;pace of half an hour. He alledges that it is cooled by its pa&s;&s;age over the &s;ea, which entirely di&s;arms it of the&s;e tremendous effects, before it reaches Sicily. But if this were true, we &s;hould expect to find it most violent on that &s;ide of the i&s;land that lies near|e&s;t to Africa, which is not the ca&s;e: Though indeed it is po&s;&s;ible, that its heat may be again increa&s;ed by its pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the i&s;land; for it has ever been found much more violent at Palermo, which is near the mo&s;t northern point, than any where el&s;e in Sicily. Indeed, I begin to be more reconciled to this rea&s;on, when I con&s;ider that this city is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by high mountains, the ravines and vallies betwixt which are parched up and burning hot at this &s;ea&s;on. The&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="024150_0296_0FC3D522382BC6A8">
likewi&s;e contain innumerable &s;prings of warm water, the &s;teams of which mu&s;t tend greatly to increa&s;e the heat, and perhaps likewi&s;e to &s;often the air, and di&s;arm it of its noxious qualities. It is a practice too, at this &s;ea&s;on, to burn heath and bru&s;hwood on the moun|tains, which mu&s;t &s;till add to the heat of the air.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen who were in the country told me, that they walked out immediately after the &s;irocc, and found the gra&s;s and plants that had been green the day before, were become quite brown, and crackled under their feet as if dried in an oven.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add for your amu&s;ement, a journal of the weather &s;ince we came to Palermo. The barometer has continued con&s;tantly within a line or two of the &s;ame point, 29&frac12;; and the &s;ky has been always clear, except the day of the &s;irocc and the 26th of June, when we had a pretty &s;mart &s;hower of rain for two hours; &s;o that I think I have nothing farther to do, but to mark the heights of the thermometer.</P>

<P>The more I con&s;ider the extreme violence of this heat, the more I am &s;urpri&s;ed that we were able to bear it with &s;o little inconvenience. We did not even feel that depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits that commonly attends very great heats with us. The thermometer ro&s;e 40 degrees, or very near it; and it happens &s;ingularly enough, that before the &s;irocc began, it &s;tood ju&s;t about 40 degrees above the point of congelation; &s;o that in the morning of the 8th of July, the heat increa&s;ed as much, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, as it generally does dur|ing the whole time that the &s;un moves from tropic to tropic; for the difference of 72 and 112 is the &s;ame as between the freezing point and 72; or between a cold day in winter, and a warm one in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we had a great entertainment in the palace of the Prince Partana, from the balcony of which the viceroy reviewed a regiment of Swi&s;s, the be&s;t I have yet &s;een in the Neapolitan &s;ervice. They are really a fine body of men, and, notwith&s;tanding the violence of the heat, went through their motions with great
<PB N="288" REF="024150_0298_0FC3D1227833E4C8">
&s;pirit. They had two field pieces on each flank, which were extremely well &s;erved; and the evolutions were performed with more preci&s;ion and &s;teadine&s;s than one generally meets with, except in England or Germany. The grenadiers were furni&s;hed with fal&s;e grenades, which produced every effect of real ones, except that of doing mi&s;chief. The throwing of the&s;e was the part of the entertainment that &s;eemed to plea&s;e the mo&s;t; and the grenadiers took care to direct them &s;o, that their effect &s;hould not be lo&s;t. When a number of them fell together among&s;t a thick crowd of the mo|bility, which was commonly the ca&s;e, it afforded an entertaining &s;cene enough, for they defended them&s;elves with their hats, and threw them very dexterou&s;ly upon their neighbours. However, we &s;aw no damage done, except the &s;ingeing of a few wigs and caps; for the ladies were there in as great numbers as the gentlemen.</P>
<P>The company at the Prince Partana's was brilliant, and the entertainment noble. It con&s;i&s;ted principally of ices, creams, chocolate, &s;weetmeats, and fruits, of which there was a great variety. Not one half of the company played at cards; the re&s;t amu&s;ed them&s;elves in conver&s;ation and walking on the terrace. We found the young prince and prince&s;s who are very amiable, with &s;everal of their companions playing at cross-pur|po&s;es, and other games of that kind. We were joy|fully admitted of this cheerful little circle, where we amu&s;ed our&s;elves very well for &s;everal hours. I only mention this, to &s;hew you the different &s;y&s;tem of beha|viour here and in Italy, where no &s;uch familiar inter|cour&s;e is allowed among&s;t young people before mar|riage. The young ladies here are ea&s;y, affable, and unaffected; and, not (as on the continent) perpetually &s;tuck up by the &s;ides of their mothers, who bring them into company, not for their amu&s;ement, but rather to
<PB N="289" REF="024150_0299_0FC3D123F863A370">
offer them for &s;ale; and &s;eem mightily afraid le&s;t every one &s;hould &s;teal them, or that they them&s;elves &s;hould make an elopement; which indeed I &s;hould think there was &s;ome danger of, con&s;idering the re&s;traint under which they are kept: For &s;urely there is no &s;uch &s;trong incitement to vice, as the making a puni&s;hment of virtue.</P>
<P>Here the mothers &s;hew a proper confidence in their daughters, and allow their real characters to form and to ripen. In the other ca&s;e they have either no cha|racter at all, or an affected one, which they take care to throw off the moment they have got a hu&s;band; when they think it impo&s;&s;ible to recede too far from tho&s;e rigorous maxims of decorum and circum&s;pection, the practice of which they had ever found &s;o extremely di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Were they allowed fir&s;t to &s;hew what they really are, I am per&s;uaded they would not be half &s;o bad; but their parents, by the manner they treat them, &s;hew that they have no confidence in their principles; and &s;eem to have adopted the ungenerous maxim of our countryman,
<Q>"That every woman is at heart a rake."</Q></P>
<P>Now in countries where this maxim becomes of general belief, there is no doubt, that it likewi&s;e becomes true; for the women having no longer any character to &s;upport, they will even avoid the pretences to virtue, well knowing that tho&s;e pretences are only looked upon as hypocri&s;y and affectation. I dare &s;ay, you will agree with me, that the better method to make them virtuous, is fir&s;t to make them believe that we think them &s;o; for where virtue is really e&s;teemed, there are none
<PB N="290" REF="024150_0300_0FC3D125965D8278">
that would willingly relinqui&s;h the character; but where it requires a guard, (as par&s;on Adams &s;ays) it certainly is not worth the centinel.</P>
<P>Some of the families here put me in mind of our dome&s;tic &s;y&s;tem. The prince of Re&s;uttana, his wife and daughter, are always together; but it is becau&s;e they chu&s;e to be &s;o, and there appears the &s;tronge&s;t affection, without the lea&s;t diffidence on the one &s;ide, or re&s;traint on the other. The young prince&s;s Donna Ro&s;olia is one of the mo&s;t amiable young ladies I have &s;een; &s;he was of our little party la&s;t night, and indeed made one of its greate&s;t ornaments. It would appear vain and partial after this to &s;ay that in countenance, &s;entiment, and behaviour, &s;he &s;eems altogether Eng|li&s;h; but it is true: And this perhaps may have con|tributed to advance her &s;till higher in our e&s;teem; for in &s;pite of all our philo&s;ophy the&s;e unphilo&s;ophical prejudices will &s;till exi&s;t, and no man, I believe, has entirely dive&s;ted him&s;elf of them. We had lately a noble entertainment at her father's country hou&s;e, and had rea&s;on to be much plea&s;ed with the unaffected ho&s;pitality and ea&s;y politene&s;s of the whole family. This palace is reckoned the mo&s;t magnificent in the neighbourhood of Palermo. It lies about &s;ix or &s;even miles to the we&s;t of the city, in the country called Il Colle; in the oppo&s;ite direction from the Bagaria, which I have already mentioned. The viceroy and his family, with the greate&s;t part of the nobility, were of this party, which la&s;ted till about two in the morning. At midnight a curious &s;et of fire-works were played off, from the leads of the palace, which had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine effect from the garden below.</P>
<P>Farewell. I had no time to write ye&s;terday, and though we did not break up till near three this morning,

I have got up at eight, I was &s;o eager to give you &s;ome account of the &s;irocc wind.</P>

<P>ABOUT five in the afternoon, the fe&s;tival began by the triumph of St. Ro&s;olia, who was drawn with great pomp through the centre of the city, from the Marino to the Porto Nuovo. The triumphal car was preceeded by a troop of hor&s;e, with trumpets and kettle-drums; and all the city officers in their gala uniforms. It is indeed a mo&s;t enormous machine: It mea&s;ures &s;eventy feet long, thirty wide, and upwards
<PB N="292" REF="024150_0302_0FC3D12D6CCD6FC8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eighty high; and, as it pa&s;&s;ed along, over-topped the loftie&s;t hou&s;es of Palermo. The form of its under-part is like that of the Roman gallies, but it &s;wells as it advances in height; and the front a&s;&s;umes an oval &s;hape like an amphitheatre, with &s;eats placed in the theatrical manner. This is the great orche&s;tra, which was filled with a numerous band of mu&s;icians placed in rows, one above the other: Over this orche&s;tra and a little be|hind it, there is a large dome &s;upported by &s;ix Corin|thian columns, and adorned with a number of figures of &s;aints and angels; and on the &s;ummit of the dome there is a gigantic &s;ilver &s;tatue of St. Ro&s;olia. The whole machine is dre&s;&s;ed out with orange-trees, flower-pots, and trees of artificial coral. The car &s;topped every fifty or &s;ixty yards, when the orche&s;tra perform|ed a piece of mu&s;ic, with &s;ongs in honor of the &s;aint. It appeared a moving ca&s;tle, and completely filled the great &s;treet from &s;ide to &s;ide. This indeed was its greate&s;t di&s;advantage, for the &s;pace it had to move in was in no wi&s;e proportioned to its &s;ize, and the hou&s;es &s;eemed to dwindle away to nothing as it pa&s;&s;ed along. This va&s;t fabric was drawn by fifty-&s;ix huge mules, in two rows, curiou&s;ly capari&s;oned, and mounted by twenty-eight po&s;tillions, dre&s;&s;ed in gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, with great plumes of o&s;trich feathers in their hats. Every window and balcony, on both &s;ides of the &s;treet, were full of well-dre&s;&s;ed people, and the car was fol|lowed by many thou&s;ands of the lower &s;ort. The triumph was fini&s;hed in about three hours; and was &s;ucceeded by the beautiful illumination of the Marino.</P>
<P>I believe I have already mentioned, that there is a range of arches and pyramids extending from end to end of this noble walk: The&s;e are painted and adorned with artificial flowers, and are entirely covered with lamps, placed &s;o very thick, that at a little di&s;tance the
<PB N="293" REF="024150_0303_0FC3D12DDDEB2248">
whole appears &s;o many pyramids and arches of flame. The whole chain of this illumination was about a mile in length, and indeed you can hardly conceive any thing more &s;plendid. There was no break or imperfection any where; the night being &s;o &s;till that not a &s;ingle lamp was extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the centre of this great line of light, there was a magnificent pavilion erected for the viceroy and his company, which con&s;i&s;ted of the whole nobility of Palermo: And on the front of this, at &s;ome little di&s;|tance in the &s;ea, &s;tood the great fire-works, repre&s;ent|ing the front of a palace, adorned with columns, arch|es, trophies, and every ornament of architecture. All the chebecks, galleys, galliots and other &s;hipping, were ranged around this palace, and formed a kind of amphi|theatre in the &s;ea, inclo&s;ing in it the centre. The&s;e began the &s;how by a di&s;charge of the whole of their artillery, the &s;ound of which re-echoed from the moun|tains, produced a very noble effect; they then played off a variety of water rockets, and bombs of a curious con&s;truction, that often bur&s;t below water. This con|tinued for half an hour, when, in an in&s;tant, the whole of the palace was beautifully illuminated. This was the &s;ignal for the &s;hipping to cea&s;e, &amp; appeared indeed like a piece of enchantment, as it was done altogether in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, and without the appearance of any agent. At the &s;ame time the fountains that were repre|&s;ented in the court before the palace, began to &s;pout up fire, and made a repre&s;entation of &s;ome of the great <HI>jet d'eaus</HI> of Ver&s;ailles and Marly. As &s;oon as the&s;e were extingui&s;hed, the court a&s;&s;umed the form of a great parterre; adorned with a variety of palm-trees of fire, inter&s;per&s;ed with orange-trees, flower-pots, va&s;es, and other ornaments. On the extingui&s;h|ing of the&s;e the illumination of the palace was like|wi&s;e
<PB N="294" REF="024150_0304_0FC3D12F43C45B00">
extingui&s;hed; and the front broke out into the appearance of a variety of &s;uns, &s;tars, and wheels of fire, which in a &s;hort time reduced it to a perfect ruin. And when all appeared fini&s;hed, there bur&s;t from the centre of the pile, a va&s;t explo&s;ion of two thou&s;and rockets, bombs, &s;erpents, &s;quibs, and devils, which &s;eemed to fill the whole atmo&s;phere; the fall of the&s;e made terrible havock among&s;t the clothes of the poor people who were not under cover, but afforded admi|rable entertainment to the nobility who were. Dur|ing this exhibition we had a hand&s;ome entertainment of coffee, ices and &s;weatmeats, with a variety of excellent wines, in the great pavilion in the centre of the Mari|no; this was at the expen&s;e of the Duke of Ca&s;tella|no, the praetor (or mayor) of the city. The principal nobility give the&s;e entertainments by turns every night during the fe&s;tival, and vie with each other in their magnificence.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fireworks were fini&s;hed, the viceroy went out to &s;ea in a galley richly illuminated. We cho&s;e to &s;tay on &s;hore, to &s;ee the appearance it made at a di&s;tance. It was rowed by &s;eventy-two oars, and indeed made one of mo&s;t beautiful objects you can im|agine; flying with va&s;t velocity over the waters, as &s;mooth and as clear as gla&s;s, which &s;hone round it like a flame, and reflected its &s;plendour on all &s;ides. The oars beat time to the French-horns, clarionets, and trumpets, of which there was a numerous band on the prow.</P>
<P>The day's entertainment was concluded by the Cor&s;o, which began exactly at midnight, and la&s;ted 'till two in the morning.</P>
<P>The great &s;treet was illuminated in the &s;ame magnif|icent
<PB N="295" REF="024150_0305_0FC3D13107B61348">
manner as the Marino. The arches and pyra|mids were erected at little di&s;tances from each other, on both &s;ides of the &s;treet, betwixt the foot-path and the &s;pace for carriages; and when &s;een from either of the gates, appeared to be two continued lines of the brighte&s;t flame. Indeed, the&s;e illuminations are &s;o very different, and &s;o much &s;uperior, to any I have ever &s;een, that I find it difficult to give any tolerable idea of them. Two lines of coaches occupied the &s;pace be|twixt the&s;e two lines of illumination. They were in the greate&s;t gala; and as they open from the middle, and let down on each &s;ide, the beauty of the ladies, the richne&s;s of their dre&s;s, and brilliance of their jewels, were di&s;played in the mo&s;t advantageous manner.</P>
<P>This beautiful train moved &s;lowly round and round for the &s;pace of two hours; and every member of it &s;eemed animated with a de&s;ire to plea&s;e. The compa|ny appeared all joy and exultation: Scarce two coach|es pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome mutual acknowledgement of affection or re&s;pect; and the plea&s;ure that &s;parkled from every eye &s;eemed to be reflected and communi|cated by a kind of &s;ympathy through the whole.</P>
<P>In &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the heart not to dilate and expand it&s;elf; I own mine was often &s;o full, that I could hardly find utterance; and I have &s;een a tragedy with le&s;s emotion than I did this &s;cene of joy. I always thought the&s;e affections had been &s;trangers to pomp and parade; but here the univer&s;al joy &s;eemed really to &s;pring from the heart; it brightened up every countenance, and &s;poke affection and friend|&s;hip from every face. No &s;tately air, no &s;upercilious look; all appeared friends and equals. And &s;ure I am, that the beauty of the ladies was not half &s;o much heightened either by their dre&s;s or their jewels, as by
<PB N="296" REF="024150_0306_0FC3D13624E83A18">
that air of complacency and good humour with which it was animated.</P>
<P>We were di&s;tributed in different coaches among&s;t the nobility, which gave us a better opportunity of making the&s;e ob&s;ervations. I will own to you, that I have never beheld a more delightful &s;ight; and if &s;u|per&s;tition often produces &s;uch effects, I &s;incerely wi&s;h we had a little more of it among&s;t us. I could have thrown my&s;elf down before St. Ro&s;olia, and ble&s;&s;ed her for making &s;o many people happy.</P>
<P>We retired about two o'clock, but the variety of glittering &s;cenes and gaudy objects &s;till vibrated before my eyes, and prevented me from &s;leeping; however, I am almo&s;t as much refre&s;hed as if I had; but I really believe four more &s;uch days will be too much for any of us. Indeed, I am &s;ure that it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep it up, and it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily flag. I think, from what I can ob&s;erve, they have already exhau&s;ted almo&s;t one half of their preparations; how they are to &s;upport the other four days, I own, I do not comprehend; how|ever, we &s;hall &s;ee.</P>
<P>I thought to have given you an account of every thing at night, after it was over, but I find it impo&s;&s;ible; the &s;pirits are too much di&s;&s;ipated, and exhau&s;ted, and the imagination is too full of objects to be able to &s;ep|arate them with any degree of regularity. I &s;hall write you therefore regularly the morning following, when this fever of the fancy has had time to cool, and when things appear as they really are. Adieu then 'till to|morrow. Here is a fine &s;hower, which will cool the air, and &s;ave the trouble of watering the Marino and the great &s;treet, which is done regularly every morning when there is no rain. The thermometer is at 73.</P>

13th. I thought there would be a falling off. Ye&s;|terday's entertainments were not &s;o &s;plendid as tho&s;e of the day before. They began by the hor&s;e-races. There were three races, and &s;ix hor&s;es &s;tarted each race. The&s;e were mounted by boys of about twelve years old, without either &s;addle or bridle, but only a &s;mall piece of cord, by way of bit, in the hor&s;e's mouth, which it &s;eems is &s;ufficient to &s;top them. The great &s;treet was the cour&s;e; and to this end it was covered with earth to the depth of five or &s;ix inches. The firing of a cannon at the Porto Felice was the &s;ignal for &s;tarting; and the hor&s;es &s;eemed to under&s;tand this, for they all &s;et off at once, full &s;peed, and continued at their utmo&s;t &s;tretch to the Porto Nuovo, which was the winning po&s;t. It is exactly a mile, and they per|formed it in a minute and thirty-five &s;econds, which, con&s;idering the &s;ize of the hor&s;es, (&s;carce fourteen hands) we thought was very great. The&s;e are gen|erally Barbs, or a mixed breed, betwixt a Sicilian and Barb. The boys were gaudily dre&s;&s;ed, and made a pretty appearance. We were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee how well they &s;tuck on; but indeed, I ob&s;erved they had generally laid fa&s;t hold of the mane.</P>
<P>The moment before &s;tarting, the &s;treet appeared full of people; nor did we conceive how the race could po&s;&s;ibly be performed. Our &s;urpri&s;e was increa&s;ed when we &s;aw the hor&s;es run full &s;peed at the very thicke&s;t of this crowd, which did not begin to open, 'till they were almo&s;t clo&s;e upon it. The people then opened, and fell back on each &s;ide, by a regular uniform motion, from one end of the &s;treet to the other. This &s;ingular manoeuvre &s;eemed to be performed without any bu&s;tle or confu&s;ion, and the moment the hor&s;es were pa&s;t, they clo&s;ed again behind them. However, it de&s;troys great part of the plea&s;ure of the race; for
<PB N="298" REF="024150_0308_0FC3D13D21584528">
you cannot help being under apprehen&s;ions for &s;uch a number of people, whom you every moment &s;ee in im|minent danger of being trod to death; for this mu&s;t inevitably be their fate, were they only a &s;econd or two later in retiring. The&s;e accidents, they allow, have often happened; however, ye&s;terday every body e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The victor was conducted along the &s;treet in tri|umph, with his prize di&s;played before him. This was a piece of white &s;ilk embroidered and worked with gold.</P>
<P>The&s;e races I think are much &s;uperior to the com|mon &s;tile of races in Italy, which are performed by hor&s;es alone without riders; but they are by no means to be compared to tho&s;e in England.</P>
<P>The great &s;treet was illuminated in the &s;ame man|ner as on the preceding night; and the grand conver|&s;ation of the nobles was held at the archbi&s;hop's palace, which was richly fitted up for the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The gardens were finely illuminated; and put me in mind of our Vauxhall. There were two orche&s;tras (one at each end) and two very good bands of mu&s;ic. The entertainment was &s;plendid, and the archbi&s;hop &s;hewed attention and politene&s;s to every per&s;on of the company.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock the great triumphal car marched back again in proce&s;&s;ion to the Marino. It was rich|ly illuminated with large wax tapers, and made a mo&s;t formidable figure. Don Quixote would have been very excu&s;able in taking it for an inchanted ca&s;tle, moving through the air. We did not leave the arch|bi&s;hop's 'till midnight, when the Cor&s;o began, which was preci&s;ely the &s;ame in every re&s;pect as the night before, and afforded us a delightful &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="024150_0309_0FC3D13E3B5679B8">14th. La&s;t night the two great &s;treets and the four gates of the city that terminate them, were illuminated in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner. The&s;e &s;treets cro&s;s each other in the centre of the city, where they form a beau|tiful &s;quare, called <HI>La Piazza Ottangolare,</HI> from the eight angles they form. This &s;quare was richly or|namented with tape&s;try, &s;tatues, and artificial flowers; and as the buildings which form its four &s;ides are uni|form, and of a beautiful architecture, and at the &s;ame time highly illuminated, it made a fine appearance.</P>
<P>There are four orche&s;tras erected in it; and the four bands of mu&s;ic are greater than I had any concep|tion this city could have produced.</P>
<P>From the centre of this &s;quare you have a view of the whole city of Palermo thus dre&s;&s;ed out in its glory; and indeed, the effect it produces &s;urpa&s;&s;es belief. The four gates that form the vi&s;tas to this &s;plendid &s;cene are highly decorated, and lighted up in an elegant ta&s;te; the illuminations repre&s;enting a variety of trophies, the arms of Spain, tho&s;e of Naples, Sicily, and the city of Palermo, with their guardian geniu&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of the nobles was held in the vice|roy's palace; and the entertainment was &s;till more magnificent than any of the former. The great fire|works oppo&s;ite to the front of the palace began at ten o'clock, and ended at midnight; after which we went to the Cor&s;o, which la&s;ted, as u&s;ual, 'till two in the morning. This part of the entertainment &s;till plea&s;es us mo&s;t; it is indeed the only part of it that reaches the heart; and where this is not the ca&s;e, a puppet-&s;how is ju&s;t as good as a coronation. We have now got ac|quainted almo&s;t with every countenance; and from that air of goodne&s;s and benignity that animates them,
<PB N="300" REF="024150_0310_0FC3D13FC2075D08">
and which &s;eems to be mutually reflected from one to the other, we are inclined to form the mo&s;t favourable opinion of the people.</P>
<P>Our fireworks la&s;t night were greater than tho&s;e of the Marino, but their effect did not plea&s;e me &s;o much; the want of the &s;ea and the &s;hipping were two capital wants. They likewi&s;e repre&s;ented the front of a pal|ace, but of a greater extent. It was illuminated too as the former, and the whole conducted pretty much in the &s;ame manner. We &s;aw it to the greate&s;t ad|vantage from the balconies of the &s;tate apartments, in the viceroy's palace, where we had an elegant concert; but to the no &s;mall di&s;appointment of the company, Gabrieli, the fine&s;t &s;inger, but the mo&s;t capricious mortal upon earth, did not chu&s;e to perform.</P>
<P>15th. Three races, &s;ix hor&s;es each, as formerly. They called it very good &s;port. I cannot &s;ay that I admired it. A poor creature was rode down, and I believe killed; and one of the boys had likewi&s;e a fall.</P>
<P>The great a&s;&s;embly of the nobility was held at the Judice Monarchia's an officer of high tru&s;t and dignity. Here we had an entertainment in the &s;ame &s;tile as the others, and a good concert. At eleven o'clock the viceroy, attended by the whole company, went on foot to vi&s;it the &s;quare and the great church. We made a prodigious train; for though the city was all a lamp of light, the &s;ervants of the viceroy and nobility attend|ed with wax flambeaux, to &s;hew us the way. As &s;oon as the viceroy entered the &s;quare, the four orche&s;tras &s;truck up a &s;ymphony, and continued playing 'till he left it.</P>
<P>The crowd around the church was very great,
<PB N="301" REF="024150_0311_0FC3D1414497D7A0">
and without pre&s;ence of the viceroy, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for us to get in; but his attendants &s;oon cleared the pa&s;&s;ages; and at once entering the great gate, we beheld the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;cene in the world. The whole church appeared a flame of light; which, reflected from ten thou&s;and bright and &s;hining &s;urfaces of different colours and of different angles, produced an effect, which, I think, exceeds all the de&s;criptions of enchantment I have ever read. Indeed, I did not think that human art could have devi&s;ed any thing &s;o &s;plendid. I believe I have already mentioned that the whole church, walls, roof, pillars, and pila&s;ters were entirely covered over with mirror, inter&s;per&s;ed with gold and &s;ilver paper, artificial flowers, &amp;c. done up with great ta&s;te and elegance, &s;o that not one inch either of &s;tone or pla&s;ter was to be &s;een. Now, form an idea, if you can, of our great ca|thedrals dre&s;&s;ed out in this maner, and illuminated with twenty thou&s;and wax-tapers, and you will have &s;ome faint notion of this &s;plendid &s;cene. I own it did greatly exceed my expectations, although, from the de&s;crip|tions we had of it, they were rai&s;ed very high. When we recovered from our fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, which had produced, unknown to our&s;elves, many exclamations of a&s;toni&s;h|ment, I ob&s;erved that all the eyes of the nobility were fixed upon us; and that they enjoyed exceedingly the a|mazement into which we were thrown. Indeed this &s;cene, in my opinion, greatly exceeds all the re&s;t of the &s;how.</P>
<P>I have often heard the illumination of St. Peter's &s;poken of as a wonderful fine thing: So indeed it is; but it is certainly no more to be compared to this, than the planet Venus is to the &s;un. The effects indeed are of a different kind, and cannot well be compared together.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="024150_0312_0FC3D14752BE7258">This &s;cene was too glaring to bear any con&s;iderable time; and the heat occa&s;ioned by the immen&s;e number of lights, &s;oon became intolerable. I attempted to rec|kon the number of lu&s;tres, and counted upwards of five hundred; but my head became giddy, and I was obliged to give it up. They a&s;&s;ure us that the number of wax-tapers is not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and. There are eight-and-twenty altars, fourteen on each &s;ide; the&s;e are dre&s;&s;ed out with the utmo&s;t magnificence; and the great altar is &s;till the mo&s;t &s;plendid of all.</P>
<P>When you think of the gaudy materials that compo&s;e the lining of this church, it will be difficult to annex an idea of grandeur and maje&s;ty to it: At lea&s;t, &s;o it &s;truck me, when I was fir&s;t told of it; yet, I a&s;&s;ure you, the elegant &s;implicity and unity of the de&s;ign prevents this effect, and gives an air of dignity to the whole.</P>
<P>It is on this part of the &s;how the people of Palermo value them&s;elves mo&s;t; they talk of all the re&s;t as tri|fling in compari&s;on of this; and indeed, I think it is probable, that there is nothing of the kind in the world that is equal to it. It is &s;trange they &s;hould chu&s;e to be at &s;o great an expen&s;e and trouble, for a &s;how of a few hours only; for they have already begun this morning, to &s;trip the church of its gaudy dre&s;s, and I am told it will not be fini&s;hed for many weeks.</P>
<P>From the church we went immediately to the Cor&s;o, which concluded, as u&s;ual, the entertainments of the day.</P>
<P>16th. La&s;t night we had the full illumination of all the &s;treets. The a&s;&s;embly was held at the praetor's where there was an elegant entertainment and a concert. Pacherotti, the fir&s;t man of the opera, di&s;|tingui&s;hed
<PB N="303" REF="024150_0313_0FC3D149058D3038">
him&s;elf very much. I think he is one of the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ingers I ever heard; and am per|&s;uaded, that in a few years, he will be very celebrated. Campanucci, the &s;econd &s;oprano, is, I think, prefer|able to mo&s;t that I have heard in Italy; and you will the more ea&s;ily believe this, when I inform you, that he is engaged for next winter, to be the fir&s;t &s;inger in the great opera at Rome. Is it not &s;trange, that the capital of all Italy; and, for the fine arts, (as it form|erly was for arms) the capital of the world, &s;hould conde&s;cend to chu&s;e its fir&s;t opera performer from among&s;t the &s;ubalterns of a remote Sicilian &s;tage?</P>
<P>You will believe, that with two &s;uch &s;opranos as the&s;e, and Gabrieli for the fir&s;t woman, the opera here will not be a de&s;picable one. It is to begin in a few days notwith&s;tanding the extreme heat of the &s;ea&s;on; &s;o fond are the people here of the&s;e entertainments.</P>
<P>Their opera dancers are tho&s;e you had la&s;t year at London; they are ju&s;t arrived, and the people are by no means plea&s;ed with them. We &s;aw them this morning at the rehear&s;al; and, to their great &s;urpri&s;e, addre&s;&s;ed them in Engli&s;h. You cannot imagine how happy they were to &s;ee us. Poor &s;ouls! I was delighted to hear with what warmth of gratitude and affection they &s;poke of England. There is a mother and two daughters; the younge&s;t pretty, but the elde&s;t, the fir&s;t dancer, appears a &s;en&s;ible, mode&s;t, well-behaved girl; more &s;o than is common with the&s;e &s;ort of people. Speaking of England, &s;he &s;aid, with a degree of warmth, that her good treatment in general could hardly in&s;pire, that in her life &s;he never left any country with &s;o &s;ore a heart; and had &s;he only enjoyed her health, all the world &s;hould never have torn her away from it.

the Engli&s;h nation; but alledged that the &s;enti|ments, and the manner in which they were uttered could &s;carcely proceed from a <HI>general love</HI> of the country. She an&s;wered me with a &s;mile, but at the &s;ame time I could ob&s;erve the tear in her eye. At that in&s;tant we were interrupted; however, I &s;hall endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to learn her &s;tory; for I am per&s;uaded there is one: Perhaps you may know it, as I dare &s;ay it is no &s;ecret in London.</P>
<P>But I have got quite away from my &s;ubject, and had forgot that I &s;at down to give you an account of the fea&s;t. Indeed I will own, it is a kind of &s;ubject I by no means like to write upon; I almo&s;t repent that I had undertaken it, and am heartily glad it is now over. It does very well to &s;ee &s;hows; but their de&s;cription is of all things on earth the mo&s;t in&s;ipid: For words and writing convey ideas only by a &s;low and regular kind of progre&s;s; and while we gain one, we generally lo&s;e another, &s;o that the fancy &s;eldom embraces the whole; but when a thou&s;and objects &s;trike you at once, the imagination is filled and &s;atis|fied.</P>
<P>The great proce&s;&s;ion that clo&s;es the fe&s;tival began at ten o'clock. It only differed from other proce&s;|&s;ions in this, that be&s;ides all the prie&s;ts, friars, and religious orders of the city, there were placed an equal di&s;tances from each other ten lo&s;ty machines made of wood and pa&s;teboard, ornamented in an elegant man|ner, repre&s;enting temples, tabernacles, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a variety of beautiful pieces of architecture. The&s;e are furn|i&s;hed by the different convents and religious fraterni|ties, who vie with each other in the richne&s;s and ele|gance of the work. Some of them are not le&s;s than &s;ixty feet high. They are filled with figures of &s;aints and of angels, made of wax, &s;o natural and &s;o admirably

well painted, that many of them &s;eemed really to be alive. All the&s;e figures are prepared by the nuns, and by them dre&s;&s;ed out in rich robes of gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>We were a good deal amu&s;ed this morning to &s;ee them returning home in coaches to their re&s;pective nunneries. At fir&s;t we took them for ladies in their gala dre&s;s, going out to vi&s;it the churches, which we were told was the cu&s;tom, and began to pull off our hats as they went pa&s;t. Indeed, we were led into this blun|der by &s;ome of our friends, who carried us out on purpo&s;e; and as they &s;aw the coaches approach, told us, This is the Prince&s;s of &s;uch a thing; there is the Dutch|e&s;s of &s;uch another thing; and, in &s;hort, we had made half a dozen of our be&s;t bows, (to the no &s;mall entertain|ment of the&s;e wags) before we di&s;covered the trick. They now in&s;i&s;t upon it, that we are good Catholics, for all this morning we had been bowing to &s;aints and angels.</P>
<P>A great &s;ilver box, containing the bones of St. Ro&s;olia, clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion. It was carried by thirty-&s;ix of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable burge&s;&s;es of the city, who look upon this as the greate&s;t honour. The archbi&s;hop walked behind it, giving his benediction to the people as he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the proce&s;&s;ion fini&s;hed the tour of the great &s;quare before the praetor's palace, than the fountain in the centre, one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t in Europe, was converted into a fountain of fire; throw|ing it up on all &s;ides, and making a beautiful appear|ance. It only la&s;ted for a few minutes, and was extingui&s;hed by a va&s;t explo&s;ion, which concluded the whole. As this was altogether unexpected, it produ|ced
<PB N="306" REF="024150_0316_0FC3D15C57FCF9D8">
a fine effect, and &s;urpri&s;ed the &s;pectators more than any of the great fireworks had done.</P>
<P>There was a mutual and friendly congratulation ran through the whole a&s;&s;embly, which &s;oon after parted; and this morning every thing has once more rea&s;&s;umed its natural form and order; and I a&s;&s;ure you, we were not more happy at the opening of the fe&s;tival, than we are now at its conclu&s;ion. Every body was fatigued and exhau&s;ted by the perpetual fea&s;ting, watching, and di&s;&s;ipation of the&s;e five days. However, upon the whole, we have been much delighted with it, and may with truth pronounce, that the entertainments of the fea&s;t of St. Ro&s;olia are much beyond tho&s;e of the holy week at Rome; of the A&s;cen&s;ion, at Venice; or, indeed, any other fe&s;tival we have ever been witne&s;s of.</P>
<P>I believe I did not tell you, that about ten or twelve days ago, as the time we had appointed for our return to Naples was elap&s;ed, we had hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and provided every thing for our departure: We had even taken leave of the viceroy, and received our pa&s;&s;ports. Our baggage and &s;ea-&s;tore was already on board, when we were &s;et upon by our friends, and &s;olicited with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s and cordiality, to give them another fortnight, that we found it impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e it; and in con&s;equence di&s;charged our ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ent for our trunks. I &s;hould not have mentioned this, were it not to &s;hew you how much more attention is paid to &s;tran|gers here than in mo&s;t places on the continent.</P>
<P>We reckon our&s;elves much indebted to them for having obliged us to prolong our &s;tay; as, independent of the amu&s;ements of the fe&s;tival, we have met with &s;o much ho&s;pitality and urbanity, that there it is now with the mo&s;t &s;incere regret we find our&s;elves obliged to

leave them. Indeed, had we brought our clothes and books from Naples, it is hard to &s;ay how long we might have &s;tayed.</P>
<P>We have &s;ent to engage a ve&s;&s;el, but probably &s;hall not &s;ail for five or &s;ix days. Adieu.</P>

<P>WE have now had time to enquire a little into &s;ome of the antiquities of this i&s;land, and have found &s;everal people, particularly the prince of Torremuzzo, who have made this the great object of their &s;tudy. However, I find we mu&s;t wade through oceans of fiction, before we can arrive at any thing certain or &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Sicilian authors agree in deriving their origin from Ham, or, as they call him, Cham, the &s;on of Noah, who, they pretend, is the &s;ame with Saturn. They tell you that he built a great city, which from him was named Came&s;ena. There have been violent di&s;putes about the &s;ituation of this city: Bero&s;o &s;uppo&s;es it to have &s;tood, where Camari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a was afterwards founded&punc; and that this was only a cor|ruption of its primitive name. But Guarneri, Carrera, and others, combat this opinion, and affirm, that Came&s;ena &s;tood near the foot of Aetna, betwixt Aci and Catania, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the three rocks that &s;till bear the name of the Cyclops. Indeed Carrera mentions an in&s;cription that he had &s;een in a ruin near
<PB N="308" REF="024150_0318_0FC3D15F8BA8F088">
Aci, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the &s;epulchre of Acis, which he thinks puts his matter out of doubt. The&s;e are his words: <Q>Haec e&s;t in&s;criptio vetu&s;tae cuju&s;dam tabellae repertae in pyramide &s;epulchri Acis, ex fragmentis vetu&s;ti&s;&s;imae Chame&s;enae, urbis hodie Acis, conditae a Cham, gigantum principe, etiam noncupato Saturno, Chame&s;eno, in promon|torio Xiphonio, ubi adhuc hodie vi&s;untur &s;olo aequata antiqua ve&s;tigia, et ruinae dictae urbis et arcis in in&s;ula prope Scopulos Cyclopum, et retinet adhuc &s;incopatum nomen La Gazzena.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ame Cham they tell you was a very great &s;coundrel, and that <HI>e&s;enus</HI> which &s;ignified infamous, was added to his name, only to denote his character. Fazzello &s;ays, he married his own &s;i&s;ter, who was called Rhea; that Ceres was the fruit of his marri|age; that &s;he did not inherit the vices of her father, but reigned over Sicily with great wi&s;dom and mod|eration. That &s;he taught her &s;ubjects the method of making bread and wine, the materials for which their i&s;land produced &s;pontaneou&s;ly in great abundance. That her daughter Pro&s;erpine was of equal beauty and virtue with her&s;elf: Orius king of Epirus had demanded her in marriage, and on a refu&s;al, carried off by force; which gave occa&s;ion to the wild imagination of Greece to in|vent the fable of the rape of Pro&s;erpine by Pluto, king of hell, this Orius being of a moro&s;e and gloomy di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Ceres has ever been the favourite deity of the Sicil|ians. She cho&s;e her &s;eat of empire in the centre of the i&s;land, on the top of a high hill called Enna, where &s;he founded the city of that name. It is &s;till a con&s;iderable place, and is now called Ca&s;tragiovan|ni; but little or nothing remain of the ruins of Enna.</P>
<P>Cicero gives a particular account of this place. He &s;ays, from its &s;ituation in the centre of the i&s;land, it
<PB N="309" REF="024150_0319_0FC3D16486C6FC40">
was called <HI>Umbilicus Siciliae,</HI> and de&s;cribes it as one of the mo&s;t beautiful and fertile &s;pots in the world, The temple of Ceres, at Enna was renowned all over the heathen world, and pilgrimages were made to it, as they are at pre&s;ent to Loretto. Fazzello &s;ays, it was held in &s;uch veneration, that when the city was &s;ur|pri&s;ed and pillaged by the &s;laves and barbarians, they did not pre&s;ume to touch this &s;acred temple, although it contained more riches than all the city be&s;ides.</P>
<P>There have been violent di&s;putes among&s;t the Sicil|ian authors, whether Pro&s;erpine was carried off near the city of Enna, or that of Aetna, which &s;tood at the foot of that mountain, but it is of mighty little con&s;e|quence, and more re&s;pect, I think, is to be paid to the &s;entiments of Cicero, who gives it in favour of Enna, than the whole of them. Diodorus too is of the &s;ame opinion, and his de&s;cription of this place is almo&s;t in the very words as tho&s;e of Cicero. They both paint it as a perfect paradi&s;e; abounding in beau|tiful groves, clear &s;prings and rivulets, and like Aetna, covered with a variety of flowers at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. To the&s;e authorities, if you plea&s;e, you may add that of Milton, who compares it to paradi&s;e it&s;elf.
<Q><L>&mdash;Nor that fair field</L>
<L>Of Enna, where Pro&s;erpine gathering flowers,</L>
<L>Her&s;elf a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis</L>
<L>Was gathered.</L></Q></P>
<P>If you want to have a fuller account of this place you will find it in Cicero's pleadings again&s;t Verres, and in the fifth book of Diodorus. I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal gentlemen who have been there; they a&s;&s;ure me that it &s;till an&s;wers in a great mea&s;ure to the de|&s;cription
<PB N="310" REF="024150_0320_0FC3D1661706B2F8">
of the&s;e authors. Medals I am told, are &s;till found, with an elegant figure of Ceres, and an ear of wheat for the rever&s;e; but I have not been able to procure any of them.</P>
<P>There was another temple in Sicily not le&s;s cele|brated than this one of Ceres. It was dedicated to Venus Erecina, and, like the other too, was built on the &s;ummit of a high mountain. The ancient name of this mountain was Eryx, or as the Sicilians call it Erice, but it is now called St. Juliano. Both moun|tain and temple are often mentioned by the Greek and Latin hi&s;torians, and happily the Sicilian ones have no di&s;pute about its &s;ituation or origin, which they make to be almo&s;t as ancient as that of Ceres. Diodorus &s;ays that Dedalus, after his flight from Crete, was ho&s;|pitably received here, and by his wonderful &s;kill in architecture added greatly to the beauty of this temple. He enriched it with many fine pieces of &s;culpture, but particularly with the figure of a ram of &s;uch exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip that it appeared to be alive. This, I think, is likewi&s;e mentioned by Cicero.</P>
<P>Aeneas too in his voyage from Troy to Italy, land|ed in this part of the i&s;land, and according to Diodoras and Thucydides, made rich pre&s;ents to this temple; but Virgil is not &s;atisfied with this; he mu&s;t rai&s;e the piety of his hero &s;till higher, and, in oppo&s;ition to all the hi&s;torians, makes Aeneas the founder of the temple. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Tum vicina a&s;tris Erycino in vertice &s;ede.</L>

&s;ays, and quotes the authority of Strabo, that &s;eventeen cities of Sicily were laid under tribute, to rai&s;e a &s;uffi|cient revenue to &s;upport the dignity, and enormous expences of this temple. Two hundred &s;oldiers were appointed for its guard, and the number of its prie&s;ts, prie&s;te&s;&s;es, and mini&s;ters male and female, were incred|ible.</P>
<P>At certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, great numbers of pigeons, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the attendants of Venus, u&s;ed to pa&s;s betwixt Africa and Italy; and re&s;t|ing for &s;ome days on mount Eryx, and round this tem|ple, it was then imagined by the people that the god|de&s;s her&s;elf was there in per&s;on; and on the&s;e occa&s;ions, he &s;ays, they wor&s;hipped her with all their might. Fe&s;tivals were in&s;tituted in honour of the deity, and the mo&s;t mode&s;t woman was looked upon as a prude, that refu&s;ed to comply with the rites. However, there wore not many complaints of this kind; and it has been alledged, that the ladies of Eryx were &s;ome|times &s;een looking out for the pigeons long before they arrived; and that they u&s;ed to &s;catter peas about the temple to make them &s;tay as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Venus was &s;ucceeded in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Eryx by St. Juliano, who now gives his name both to the city and mountain; and indeed he has a very good title, for when the place was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged, the Sicilians tell you, he appeared on the walls armed cap-a-pie, and frightened the enemy to &s;uch a degree, that they in|&s;tantly took to their heels, and left him ever &s;ince in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. It would have been long before Venus and her pigeons could have done as much for them.</P>
<P>Many medals are found in the neighbourhood, but
<PB N="312" REF="024150_0322_0FC3D16CE6377280">
there is not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of this celebrated temple. Some marbles with in&s;criptions and engravings that have been found deep below ground are almo&s;t the only remaining monuments of its exi&s;tence. Suetonius &s;ays, that it had even fallen to ruins before the time of Tiberius; but as Venus was the favourite divinity of that emperor, he had ordered it to be magnificently repaired; however, it is &s;omewhat difficult to reconcile this with Strabo's account; who tells u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that even before his time it had been totally abandoned; and indeed this &s;eems mo&s;t probable, as every ve&s;tige of it has now di&s;appeared, which is not commonly the ca&s;e with the great works of the age of Tiberius.</P>
<P>Aeneas landed at the port of Drepanum, at the foot of this mountain. Here he lo&s;t his father An|chi&s;es; in honour of whom, on his return from Car|thage about a year after, he celebrated the games that make &s;o great a figure in the Aeneid, which Virgil in|troduces with a good deal of addre&s;s as a compliment to the piety of Augu&s;tus, who had in&s;tituted games of the &s;ame kind in honour of Julius Cae&s;ar, his father by adoption.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that Virgil's account of this part of Sicily &s;hould be &s;o very different from that of Homer, when there was &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, only a few months, between the times that their two heroes vi&s;ited it. Indeed, Virgil &s;eems to have followed the hi&s;torians, in his conduct of this part of his poem, more than the &s;entiments of Homer; who makes this very country where Aeneas was &s;o ho&s;pitably received, the habitation of Polyphemus and the Cyclops, where Uly&s;&s;es lo&s;t &s;o many of his companions, and him&s;elf made &s;o very nar|row an e&s;cape. The i&s;land of Lico&s;ia where he moored his fleet, lay very near the port of Drepanum,
<PB N="313" REF="024150_0323_0FC3D1725660BAB0">
and Homer de&s;cribes the adventure of Polyphemus to have happened on the &s;hore of Sicily, oppo&s;ite to that i&s;land. Virgil has taken the liberty to change the &s;cene of action, as he was better acquainted both with the geography and hi&s;tory of the country than Homer; and perhaps with a good deal of propriety places it at the foot of mount Aetna. I am afraid there is not &s;o much propriety in changing the action it&s;elf, and con|tradicting the account that Homer gives of it. For Uly&s;&s;es &s;ays that Polyphemus devoured four of his com|panions; but that he, by his addre&s;s, &s;aved all the re&s;t, and was him&s;elf the la&s;t that e&s;caped out of the cave. Now Virgil makes Uly&s;&s;es to have told a lie, for he affirms that he left Achemenides behind him; and Achemenides too gives a different account of this affair from Uly&s;&s;es: He a&s;&s;ures Aeneas, that Polyphe|mus devoured only two of his companions; after which they put out his eye, <HI>(acuto telo)</HI> with a &s;harp weapon; which rather gives the idea of a &s;pear or jave|lin, than that of a great beam of wood made red hot in the fire, as Homer de&s;cribes it. But there are many &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages. Don't you think they &s;eem either to indicate a negligence in Virgil, or a want of deference for his ma&s;ter? Neither of which, I believe, he has ever been accu&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The Sicilian authors are by no means plea&s;ed with Virgil for making Aeneas the founder of this temple of Venus Erecina. They will only allow that the colony which he was obliged to leave there, after the burning of his &s;hips, did, in honour of his mother Venus, build the city of Eryx around her temple: But they all in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the temple was built by Eryx, or as they call him Erice, another &s;on of Venus, but much older than Aeneas; the &s;ame that was found to be &s;o equal a match for Hercules, but was at la&s;t killed by him at a box|ing
<PB N="314" REF="024150_0324_0FC3D17389FA2F18">
match near the foot of this mountain. The &s;pot where this is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened, &s;till retains the name of <HI>(il campodi Hercole)</HI> the fields of Hercules. Through the whole fifth book of the Aeneid, this Eryx is &s;tiled the brother of Aeneas; and, in his account of the games, Virgil introduces tho&s;e very gauntlets with which he fought with Hercules, <HI>(in hoc ip&s;o littore)</HI> in this very field. The &s;ight of which, from their enor|mous &s;ize, a&s;toni&s;hes the whole ho&s;t, and frightens the champion Dares &s;o much that he refu&s;es to fight.</P>
<P>Adieu. The opera begins in two days; after which, I think, we &s;hall &s;oon take leave of Sicily.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY we walked up to the Monte Pelegrino to pay our re&s;pects to St. Ro&s;olia, and thank her for the variety of entertainment &s;he afforded us. It is one of the mo&s;t fatiguing expeditions I ever made in my life. The mountain is extremely high, and &s;o uncommonly &s;teep, that the road up to it is very properly termed <HI>la Scala,</HI> or the Stair: Before the di&s;|covery of St. Ro&s;olia, it was looked upon as almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, but they have now at a va&s;t expence cut out a road, over precipices that were almo&s;t perpendic|ular. We found the &s;aint lying in her grotto, in the very &s;ame attitude in which &s;he is &s;aid to have been di&s;covered; her head reclining gently upon her hand,
<PB N="315" REF="024150_0325_0FC3D1789A610958">
and a crucifix before her. This is a &s;tatue of the fine&s;t white marble, and of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. It is placed in the inner part of the cavern, on the very &s;ame &s;pot where St. Ro&s;olia expired. It is the figure of a lovely young girl of about fifteen, in an act of devotion. The arti&s;t has found means to throw &s;omething that is extremely touching, into the countenance and air of this beautiful &s;tatue. I never in my life &s;aw one that affected me &s;o much, and am not &s;urpri&s;ed that it &s;hould have captivated the hearts of the people. It is covered with a robe of beaten gold, and is adorned with &s;ome valuable jewels. The cave is of a con&s;iderable extent, and extremely damp, &s;o that the poor little &s;aint mu&s;t have had very cold uncomfortable quarters. They have built a church around it; and appointed prie&s;ts to watch over the&s;e precious relics, and receive the offer|ings of pilgrims that vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>An in&s;cription graved by the hand of St. Ro&s;olia her&s;elf, was found in a cave in mount Que&s;quina, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from this mountain. It is &s;aid that &s;he was di&s;turbed in her retreat there, and had wandered from thence to mount Pelegrino, as a more retired and inacce&s;&s;ible place. I &s;hall copy it exactly, as it is pre&s;erved in the poor little &s;aint's own Latin.</P>
<Q>EGO ROSOLIA SINIBALDI QUISQUI|NE ET ROSARUM DOMINI FILIA AMORE DEI MEI JESU CHRISTI IN HOC ANTRO HABITA|RI DECREVI.</Q>
<P><PB N="316" REF="024150_0326_0FC3D17982AF5120">After St. Ro&s;olia was &s;cared from the cave where this in&s;cription was found, &s;he was never more heard of, 'till her bones were found about five hundred years after, in this &s;pot.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from the top of mount Pelegrino is beautiful and exten&s;ive. Mo&s;t of the Lipari i&s;lands are di&s;covered in a very clear day, and likewi&s;e a large portion of mount Aetna, although at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t the whole length of Sicily. The Bagaria too, and the Colle, covered over with a number of fine country hou&s;es and gardens, make a beautiful appear|ance. The city of Palermo &s;tands within le&s;s than two miles of the foot of the mountain, and is &s;een to great advantage. Many people went to this moun|tain during the time of the great illumination, from whence they pretend it has a fine effect; but this unfortunately we neglected.</P>
<P>Near the middle of the mountain, and not far from its &s;ummit, there &s;till appears &s;ome remains of a cel|ebrated ca&s;tle, the origin of which the Sicilian authors carry back to the mo&s;t remote antiquity. Ma&s;&s;a &s;ays, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built in the reign of Saturn immediately after the flood; for in the time of the earlie&s;t Carthaginian wars, it was already much re&s;|pected on account of its venerable antiquity. It was then a place of &s;trength, and is often mentioned by the Greek hi&s;torians. Diodorus &s;ays, in his twenty-third book, that Hamilcar kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for three years, again&s;t all the power of the Romans; who, with an army of forty thou&s;and men, attempted in vain to di&s;lodge him.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Palermo is &s;een, I think, to more advantage from the Monte Pelegrino than from any

where el&s;e. This beautiful city &s;tands near the ex|tremity of a kind of natural amphitheatre, formed by high and rocky mountains; but the country that lies betwixt the city and the&s;e mountains is one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful &s;pots in the world. The whole appears a magnificent garden, filled with fruit-trees of every &s;pecies, and watered by clear fountains and rivulets, that form a variety of windings through this delightful plain. From the &s;ingularity of this &s;ituation, as well as from the richne&s;s of the &s;oil, Palermo has had many flattering epithets be&s;towed upon it; particularly by the poets, who have denom|inated it <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a d' Oro,</HI> The Golden Shell, which is at once expre&s;&s;ive both of its &s;ituation and richne&s;s. It has likewi&s;e been &s;tiled <HI>Aurea Valle, Hortus Siciliae, &amp;c.</HI> and to include all the&s;e together, the la&s;ting term of <HI>Felix</HI> has been added to its name, by which you will find it di&s;tingui&s;hed even in the maps.</P>
<P>Many of the etymologi&s;ts alledge, that it is from the richne&s;s of this valley that it had its original name of <HI>Panormus,</HI> which, in the old Greek language, they pretend, &s;ignified All a garden: But others &s;ay there is no occa&s;ion for &s;training &s;ignifications, and a&s;&s;ert, with more appearance of plau&s;ibility, that it was called <HI>Pan-ormus,</HI> from the &s;ize and conveniency of its har|bours; one of which is recorded anciently to have extended into the very center of the city. And this is the account Diodorus gives of it; it was called Panormus, &s;ays he, becau&s;e its harbour even penetrated to the very innermo&s;t parts of the city. Panormus in the Greek language &s;ignifying All a port: And Procopius, in his hi&s;tory of the wars of the Goths, a&s;&s;ures us, that in the time of Beli&s;arius, the port was deep enough for that general to run his &s;hips up to the very walls of the city, and give the a&s;&s;ault from them. It is not now &s;o well

intitled to this name as it was formerly. The&s;e har|bours have been almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed and filled up; mo&s;t probably I think by the violent torrents from the mountains that &s;urround it; which are recorded &s;ometimes to have laid wa&s;te great part of the city. Fazzello &s;peaks of an inundation of which he was an eye-witne&s;s, that came down from the mountains with &s;uch fury, that they thought the city would have been entire|ly &s;wept away. He &s;ays, it bur&s;t down the wall near to the royal palace, and bore away every thing that oppo&s;ed its pa&s;&s;age; churches, convents, hou&s;es, to the number of two thou&s;and, and drowned upwards of three thou&s;and people. Now the fragments and ruins car|ried to the &s;ea by &s;uch a torrent alone would be &s;uffi|cient to fill up a little harbour, &s;o that we are not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that the&s;e capacious ports, for which it had been &s;o much celebrated, no longer exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to Chame&s;eno, Palermo is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t ancient city in the i&s;land. Indeed, there &s;till remain &s;ome monuments that carry back its origin to the times of the mo&s;t remote antiquity. A bi&s;hop of Lucera has wrote on this &s;ubject. He is clearly of opinion, that Palermo was founded in the days of the fir&s;t patriarchs. You will laugh at this; &s;o did I; but the bi&s;hop does not go to work upon con|jecture only; he &s;upports his opinion with &s;uch proofs, as I own to you, &s;taggered me a good deal. A Chal|dean in&s;cription was di&s;covered about &s;ix hundred years ago, on a block of white marble; it was in the reign of William II. who ordered it to be tran&s;lated into Latin and Italian. The bi&s;hop &s;ays, there are many fragments in Palermo with broken in&s;criptions in this language; and &s;eems to think it beyond a doubt, that the city was founded by the Chaldeans, in the very early ages of the world. This is the literal tran&s;lation:
<PB N="319" REF="024150_0329_0FC3D17E32260EF8">
&mdash;<Q>During the time that I&s;aac, the &s;on of Abraham, reigned in the valley of Dama&s;cus, and E&s;au, the &s;on of I&s;aac, in Idumea, a great multitude of He|brews, accompanied by many of the people of Da|ma&s;cus, and many Phoenicians, coming into this tri|angular i&s;land, took up their habitation in this mo&s;t beautiful place, to which they gave the name of Panormus.</Q></P>
<P>The bi&s;hop tran&s;lates another Chaldean in&s;cription, which is indeed a great curio&s;ity. It is &s;till pre&s;erved, though not with that care that &s;o valuable a monument of antiquity de&s;erves. It is placed over one of the old gates of the city, and when that gate falls to ruin, it will probably be for ever lo&s;t. The tran&s;lation is in Latin, but I &s;hall give it you in Engli&s;h:&mdash;<Q>There is no other God but one God. There is no other power but this &s;ame God. There is no other con|queror but this God whom we adore. The com|mander of this tower is Saphu, the &s;on of Eliphar, &s;on of E&s;au, brother of Jacob, &s;on of I&s;aac, &s;on of Abra|ham. The name of the tower is Baych, and the name of the neighbouring tower is Pharat.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e two in&s;criptions &s;eem to reflect a mutual light upon each other. Fazzello has pre&s;erved them both, and remarks upon this la&s;t, that it appears evidently from it, that the tower of Baych wat built antecedent to the time of Saphu, (or, as we tran&s;late it, Zephu) who is only mentioned as commander of the tower, but not as its founder.</P>
<P>Part of the ruins of this tower &s;till remain, and ma|ny more Chaldean in&s;criptions have been found among&s;t them, but &s;o broken and mangled, that little could be made of them. Fazzello is in great indig|nation at &s;ome ma&s;ons he found demoli&s;hing the&s;e pre|cious relics, and complains bitterly of it to the &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e,
<PB N="320" REF="024150_0330_0FC3D1837007E600">
whom he with ju&s;tice upbraids for their negligence and indifference.</P>
<P>Conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject t'other night with a gen|tleman who is well ver&s;ed in the antiquities of this place, I took the liberty of objecting to the Greek etymology, Pan-ormus, it appearing extremely ab&s;urd to give a Greek name to the city long before the exi&s;|tence of the Greek nation: I added, that I was a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed Fazzello had not attempted to account for this &s;eeming ab&s;urdity. He allowed the apparent validity of the objection, and blamed Fazzello for his negligence; but a&s;&s;ured me, that Pan-ormus, or &s;ome|thing very nearly of the &s;ame &s;ound, &s;ignified in the Chaldean language, and likewi&s;e in the Hebrew, a par|adi&s;e, or delicious garden; and that the Greeks proba|bly finding it &s;o applicable, never thought of changing its name. This I was in no capacity to contradict. He added too, that Panormus was likewi&s;e an Arabic word, and &s;ignified <HI>This water;</HI> which probably was the rea&s;on that the Saracens did not change its name, as they have done that of almo&s;t every thing el&s;e; as this is as applicable and as expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ituation of Palermo, as any of the other etymologies; it being &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with beautiful fountains of the pure&s;t water, the natural con&s;equence of the vicinity of the mountains.</P>
<P>Pray &s;hew this letter to our friend Mr. Crofts, and de&s;ire his &s;entiments on the&s;e etymologies and antiqui|ties. Tell him I have not forgot his commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall procure him all the olde&s;t and mo&s;t unintelligible books in Palermo; but I mu&s;t beg, for the repo&s;e and tranquility of mankind, that he will not republi&s;h them. On the&s;e conditions, I &s;end him a mo&s;t valuable frag|ment; It is part of a Chaldean in&s;cription that has
<PB N="321" REF="024150_0331_0FC3D1852AB4D898">
been exactly copied from a block of white marble found in the ruins of the tower Baych. I own I &s;hould like much to &s;ee it tran&s;lated: The people here have as yet made nothing of it: And we were in no capacity to a&s;&s;ist them.</P>

<P><PB N="322" REF="024150_0332_0FC3D1864DC6FA40"><GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P>On con&s;ulting the Bible, I find, that in our tran&s;|lation, this &s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is called Eliphaz, and Eliphaz's &s;on, who was captain of this tower, Zepho. The variation of the names you &s;ee is but trifling. It is not improbable that the other tower, Pharat, by a &s;mall variation of the &s;ame kind, has been named from their cou&s;in, Pharez, the &s;on of Judah, who got the &s;tart of his brother Zarah. You will find the &s;tory at the end of the thirty-eighth chapter of Gene&s;is. The thirty-&s;eventh chapter will give you &s;ome account of Eliphar and Saphu: But I can find no etymology for the name of the tower Baych. I dare &s;ay Mr. Crofts can tell you what it means. Pharez &s;ignifies a breach; a very inau&s;picious name one would think for a tower.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Palermo,</HI> <DATE><HI>July 24th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of our acquaintance with &s;ome gen|tlemen of &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation in this place, we have learned many things concerning the i&s;land, that perhaps may be worthy of your attention; and as this day is &s;o hot that I cannot go out, I &s;hall endeavour to recollect &s;ome of them, both for your amu&s;ement and my own. The thermometer is up at 81&frac12;. So you may judge of the &s;ituation of our northern con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>There is one thing, however, that I have always ob&s;erved in the&s;e &s;outhern climates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that although the degree of heat is much greater than with us, yet it is not commonly attended with that weight and oppre&s;|&s;ion of &s;pirits that generally accompany our &s;ultry days in &s;ummer. I am &s;ure, that in &s;uch a day as this, in England, we &s;hould be panting for breath; and no mor|tal would think either of reading or writing. That is not the ca&s;e here; I never was in better &s;pirits in my life: Indeed I believe the quantities of ice we eat may contribute a good deal towards it; for I find, that in a very violent heat, there is no &s;uch cordial to the &s;pirits as ice, or a draught of ice-water: It is not only from the cold it communicates but, like the cold bath, from the &s;uddenne&s;s of that communication, it braces the
<PB N="324" REF="024150_0334_0FC3D18988D4DD40">
&s;tomach, and gives a new tone to the fibers. It it &s;trange that this piece of luxury (in my opinion the greate&s;t of all, and perhaps the only healthy one) &s;hould &s;till be &s;o much neglected with us.</P>
<P>I knew an Engli&s;h lady at Nice, who in a &s;hort time was cured of a threatening con&s;umption, only by a free indulgence in the u&s;e of ices; and I am per&s;uaded, that in &s;kilful hands, few remedies would be more effectu|al in many of our &s;tomach and inflammatory complaints, as hardly any thing has a &s;tronger or more immediate effect upon the whole frame; and &s;urely our admini&s;|tering of warm drinks and potions in the&s;e complaints tend often to nouri&s;h the di&s;ea&s;e. It is the common practice here, in inflammatory fevers, to give quantities of ice-water to drink; nay, &s;o far have they carried it, that Dr. Sanghes, a celebrated Sicilian phy&s;ician, cov|ered over the brea&s;t and belly of his patients with &s;now or ice; and they a&s;&s;ure us, in many ca&s;es, with great &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;But, indeed, I ought in ju&s;tice to add, that this phy&s;ician's practice has not been generally adopted.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is from the pre&s;ent benefit I find from ice, that I have &s;aid &s;o much in favour of it; for I am fully per&s;uaded, that if I had not a quantity of it &s;tanding here below the table, I &s;hould very &s;oon be obliged to give up writing, and go to bed; but whenever I begin to flag, another gla&s;s is &s;ure to &s;et me to rights again.</P>
<P>I was going to give you &s;ome account of the fi&s;heries of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The catching of the tunny-fi&s;h con&s;titutes one of the principal Sicilian amu&s;ements during the &s;ummer months; and the caring and &s;ending them to foreign markets makes one of the greate&s;t branches of their
<PB N="325" REF="024150_0335_0FC3D18EA93A2360">
commerce. We were invited ye&s;terday by the Prince Sperlinga to a party of tunny-fi&s;hing; but the violence of the heat prevented it.</P>
<P>The&s;e fi&s;h do not make their appearance in the Sicilian &s;eas 'till towards the latter end of May; at which time the <HI>Tonnaros,</HI> as they call them, are prepared for their reception. This is a kind of aquatic ca&s;tle, formed, at a great expence, of &s;trong nets, fa&s;tened to the bottom of the &s;ea by anchors and heavy leaden weights.</P>
<P>The&s;e tonnaros are erected in the pa&s;&s;ages among&s;t the rocks and i&s;lands that are mo&s;t frequented by the tunny-fi&s;h. They take care to &s;hut up with nets the entry into the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, all but one little opening, which is called the outward gate of the tonnaro. This leads into the fir&s;t apartment, or, as they call it, the hall. As &s;oon as the fi&s;h have got into the hall, the fi&s;hermen, who &s;tand century in their boats during the &s;ea&s;on, &s;hut the outer door, which is no more than letting down a &s;mall piece of net, which effectually prevents the tunny from returning by the way they came. They then open the inner door of the hall, which leads to the &s;econd apartment, which they call the anti-chamber, and, by making a noi&s;e on the &s;urface of the water, they &s;oon drive the tunny-fi&s;h into it. As &s;oon as the whole have got into the anti-chamber, the inner door of the hall is again &s;hut, and the outer door is opened for the reception of more company.</P>
<P>Some tonnaros have a great number of apartments, with different names to them all; the &s;aloon, the par|lour, the dining-room, &amp;c. but the la&s;t apartment is always &s;tiled <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a Camera della Morte,</HI> The chamber of Death: This is compo&s;ed of &s;tronger nets and heavier anchors than the others.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="024150_0336_0FC3D19009DAB098">As &s;oon as they have collected a &s;ufficient number of tunny-fi&s;h, they are driven from all the other apart|ments into the chamber of death; where the &s;laughter begins. The fi&s;hermen, and often the gentlemen too, armed with a kind of &s;pear or harpoon, attack the poor defencele&s;s animals on all &s;ides; which now giv|ing them&s;elves up to de&s;pair, da&s;h about with great force and agility, throwing the water over all the boats; and tearing the nets to pieces, they often knock out their brains again&s;t the rocks or anchors. and &s;ometimes even again&s;t the boats of their enemies.</P>
<P>You &s;ee there is nothing very generous or manly in this &s;port. The taking of the <HI>Pe&s;ce Spada,</HI> or &s;word-fi&s;h, is a much more noble diver&s;ion: No art is made u&s;e of to en&s;nare him; but with a &s;mall harpoon, fixed to a long line, they attack him in the open &s;eas, and will often &s;trike him at a very con&s;iderable di&s;|tance. It is exactly the whale-fi&s;hing in miniature. The Sicilian fi&s;hermen (who are abundantly &s;uper&s;ti|tious) have a Greek &s;entence which they make u&s;e of as a charm to bring him near their boats. This is the only bait they u&s;e, and they pretend that it is of won|derful efficacy, and ab&s;olutely obliges him to follow them; but if unfortunately he &s;hould overhear them &s;peak a word of Italian, he plunges under water im|mediately, and will appear no more.</P>
<P>As the&s;e fi&s;h are commonly of a great &s;ize and &s;trength, they will &s;ometimes run for hours after they are &s;truck, and afford excellent &s;port. I have &s;een them with a &s;word four or five feet long, which gives them a formidable appearance in the water, particularly after they are wounded. The fle&s;h of the&s;e animals is excellent; it is more like beef than fi&s;h, and the com|mon way of dre&s;&s;ing it is in &s;teaks.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="024150_0337_0FC3D19180D93960">The fi&s;hing of the <HI>Pe&s;ce Spada</HI> is mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the &s;ea of Me&s;&s;ina, where they have likewi&s;e great quantities of eels, particularly the <HI>Morena,</HI> &s;o much e&s;teemed among&s;t the Romans, which I think is in|deed the fine&s;t fi&s;h I ever eat.</P>
<P>But it is not only their large fi&s;h that they &s;trike with harpoons; they have the &s;ame method of taking mullet, dories, a kind of mackarel, and many other &s;pecies; but this is always performed in the night. As &s;oon as it is dark, two men get into a &s;mall boat; one of them holds a lighted torch over the &s;urface of the water, the other &s;tands with his harpoon ready poi&s;ed in his hand. The light of the torch &s;oon brings the fi&s;h to the &s;urface, when the harpooner immediately &s;trikes them. I have &s;een great quanti|ties killed in this manner, both here and at Naples. A large fleet of boats employed in this kind of fi&s;h|ing make a beautiful appearance on the water, in a fine &s;ummer night.</P>
<P>The coral fi&s;hery is chiefly practi&s;ed at Trapani: They have invented a machine there, which an&s;wers the purpo&s;e much beyond their expectations. This is only a great cro&s;s of wood, to the centre of which is fixed a heavy hard &s;tone, capable of carrying the cro&s;s to the bottom. Pieces of &s;mall net are tied to each limb of the cro&s;s, which is poi&s;ed horizontally by a rope, and let down into the water. As &s;oon as they feel it touch the bottom, the rope is made fa&s;t to the boat. They then row about, all over the coral beds: The con&s;equence of which is, the great &s;tone breaks off the coral from the rocks, and it is immedi|ately entangled in the nets. Since this invention the coral fi&s;hery has turned out to con&s;iderable ac|count.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="024150_0338_0FC3D196AE7BE700">The people of Trapani are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t ingenious of the i&s;land; they are the authors of many u&s;eful and ornamental inventions. An arti&s;t there, has lately di&s;covered a method of making Cameios, which are a perfect imitation of the ancient ones engraved on the onyx. They are done on a kind of hard &s;hell from pa&s;tes of the be&s;t antiques, and &s;o admirably executed, that it is often difficult to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the ancient from the modern. The&s;e &s;et in gold, are generally worn as bracelets, and are at pre&s;ent in high e&s;timatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> among&s;t the ladies of quality here. Mrs. Hamilton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Lady Hamilton.</NOTE> procured a pair of them la&s;t year, and carried them to Naples, where they have been much admired. Commi&s;&s;ions were immediately &s;ent over, and the man has now more bu&s;ine&s;s than he can manage; however, we have been fortunate enough to procure a few pairs of them for our friends. I have &s;een Cameios that have co&s;t two hundred guineas that could &s;carce be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one of the&s;e.</P>
<P>The difficulties under which the poor Sicilians labour, from the extreme oppre&s;&s;ion of their govern|ment, obliges them &s;ometimes to invent branches of commerce that nature &s;eems to have denied them, as they are not allowed to enjoy tho&s;e &s;he has be&s;towed. The &s;ugar-cane was very much cultivated in this i&s;land, but the duties impo&s;ed were &s;o enormous, that it has been almo&s;t abandoned. But their crops of wheat alone, were they under a free government, would &s;oon be &s;ufficient to render this little nation one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in the world; for even in the wretched &s;tate of cultivation it is in at pre&s;ent, one good crop, I am told, is &s;ufficient to main|tain
<PB N="329" REF="024150_0339_0FC3D1977B6A4BF0">
the i&s;land for &s;even years. You will be a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, after this, to hear that the exportation of this commodity has been prohibited for the&s;e &s;everal years pa&s;t; at lea&s;t to all &s;uch as are not able to pay mo&s;t exorbitantly for that privilege. The con&s;equence is, that corn has become a drug. The common price of the &s;alma, which is two loads, was about thirty-one &s;hillings; at pre&s;ent it is reduced to five &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, and there is a probability that it will &s;till fall lower.</P>
<P>This crop, which has been very abundant, I am told, in many places they have hardly been at the pains to gather in, as there is little probability of this cruel prohibition being removed. The farmers are already ruined, and the ruin of their ma&s;ters mu&s;t in|evitably follow. This is the method the mini&s;try of Naples, or rather that of Spain, has taken to humble the pride of the Sicilian barons, who&s;e power they pretend is &s;till very exten&s;ive, and their juri&s;diction ab&s;olute; mo&s;t of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a right of life and death in their own domain. However, there is a probability that they will &s;oon be obliged to relinqui&s;h their privileges. The complaint is univer&s;al, and if the mini&s;try per&s;evere in the&s;e rigorous mea&s;ures, there mu&s;t be either a revolt, or they mu&s;t &s;oon be re|duced to a &s;tate of poverty as well as of &s;ervitude. I believe indeed mo&s;t of them would readily embrace any plau&s;ible &s;cheme, to &s;hake off their yoke; as in general they appear to be people of great &s;en&s;ibility, with high notions of honour and liberty.</P>
<P>Talking of the natural riches of their i&s;land; Yes, &s;ay they, if the&s;e were di&s;played, you would have rea|&s;on indeed to &s;peak of them. Take a look at the&s;e mountains, they contain rich veins of every metal, and
<PB N="330" REF="024150_0340_0FC3D19CA9AD8A58">
many Roman mines &s;till remain; but to what end &s;hould we explore them? It is not we that &s;hould reap the profit. Nay, a di&s;covery of any thing very rich might po&s;&s;ibly prove the ruin of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. No, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation the hidden trea&s;ures of the i&s;land mu&s;t ever remain a profound &s;ecret. Were we happy enough to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of your con|&s;titution, you might call us rich indeed. Many hidden doors of opulence would then be opened, which now are not even thought of, and we &s;hould &s;oon re-a&s;&s;ume our ancient name and con&s;equence; but at pre&s;ent we are nothing.</P>
<P>This is the language that &s;ome of the fir&s;t people among&s;t them hold with us. However, they &s;till boa&s;t that they retain more of the feudal government than any nation in Europe. The &s;hadow indeed re|mains, but the &s;ub&s;tance is gone long ago. It has long been the object of the Bourbon mini&s;try to re|duce the power of the barons in every kingdom. Richlieu began the &s;y&s;tem in France, and it has ever &s;ince been pro&s;ecuted by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; its influence has now &s;pread over the whole of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Europe; of which as this is the mo&s;t remote, it has likewi&s;e been the longe&s;t in reaching it.</P>
<P>The foundation of the feudal &s;y&s;tem was fir&s;t laid here by the count Rugeiro, about the middle of the eleventh century, immediately after he had driven the Saracens out of the i&s;land. He divided Sicily into three parts; the fir&s;t, by con&s;ent of his army, was giv|en to the church; the &s;econd he be&s;towed upon his officers, and the third he re&s;erved for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e three branches, or as they call them <HI>Brac|cios,</HI> (arms) he compo&s;ed his parliament, the form of

The three archbi&s;hops, all the bi&s;hops, abbes, priors, and dignified clergy, amounting to near &s;eventy, form the <HI>Braccio Eccle&s;ia&s;tico:</HI> The archbi&s;hop of Palermo is their chief. The <HI>Braccio Demaniale</HI> is formed by election, like our hou&s;e of commons: There are forty-three royal cities, &s;tiled <HI>Demaniale,</HI> that have a right to elect members. Every hou&s;eholder had a vote in this election. Their chief is the member for Palermo; who is likewi&s;e praetor (or mayor of the city.) He is an officer of the highe&s;t rank, and his power is very exten&s;ive; inferior only to that of the viceroy; in who&s;e ab&s;ence, the greate&s;t part of the authority de|volves upon him. He has a company of grenadiers for his body guard; and receives the title of excellency.</P>
<P>The praetor, together with &s;ix &s;enators, who are &s;tiled patricians, have the management of the civil gov|ernment of the city. He is appointed every year, by the king, or by the viceroy, which is the &s;ame thing; for I don't find that the people any longer exerci&s;e even the form of giving their votes: So that the very &s;hadow of liberty has now di&s;appeared as well as the &s;ub&s;tance.&mdash;You may judge of the &s;ituation of lib|erty in a kingdom, where all courts civil and criminal are appointed by regal authority, and where all offices are conferred only by the will of the &s;overeign, and depend entirely upon his caprice.</P>
<P>I own I feel mo&s;t &s;incerely for the Sicilians, who,
<PB N="332" REF="024150_0342_0FC3D19EFA3A5770">
I think, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many admirable qualities. But the &s;pirit of every nation mu&s;t infallibly &s;ink, under an oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical government.&mdash;Their &s;pirit however has in a great mea&s;ure kept them free from one branch of tyranny, the mo&s;t dreadful of all, that of the inqui&s;ition. The kings of Spain wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h it in its full force; but the barons, accu&s;|tomed to exerci&s;e de&s;potic government them&s;elves, could not bear the thoughts of becoming &s;laves to a &s;et of ignorant Spani&s;h prie&s;ts: And, I believe, they took the only way that was left to avoid it. Every inqui&s;itor that pretended to more zeal than they thought became him, was immediately a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; particularly if he pre&s;umed to interfere with the con|duct or &s;entiments of the nobility. This &s;oon took off the edge of their zeal, and reduced the holy office to a becoming moderation. However, they are ex|tremely circum&s;pect in their conver&s;ation about reli|gious matters; and generally advi&s;e &s;trangers to be on their guard, as the power of the inqui&s;ition, although con&s;iderably reduced, is by no means annihilated.</P>
<P>The laws of Sicily are &s;cattered in a great number of volumes; the&s;e the king of Sardinia intended to abridge, and collect into one code, but unfortunately he was not long enough in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, to accompli&s;h this u&s;eful work.&mdash;But where there is an authority above all laws, laws can be but of little &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The power of the viceroy is very ab&s;olute; he has not only the command of all the military force in the kingdom, but likewi&s;e pre&s;ides with unbounded author|ity in all civil tribunals; and as he is al&s;o inve&s;ted with the legantine power, his &s;way is equally great in religious matters.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="024150_0343_0FC3D1A6CFFB52E8">He has the right of nominating to all the great offices in the kingdom; and confirming of all dignities, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P>In vi&s;iting the pri&s;ons, a ceremony which be per|forms with great pomp twice a year, he has the power of liberating whatever pri&s;oners he plea&s;es; of reducing or altering their &s;entences, their comes and accu&s;ations having fir&s;t been read over to him. Indeed, that there may be &s;ome appearance of a regard to law and ju&s;tice, his coun&s;ellor always attends him on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to mark out the limits of the law.&mdash;This is an officer of very high rank, appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the viceroy in his deci&s;ions, where the ca&s;e may appear intricate or dubi|ous; and always is, or ought to be, one of the able&s;t lawyers in the i&s;land. For the mo&s;t part, this office has been given to &s;trangers, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have no kindred or particular connection here, that in giving their judgment they may be free from all prejudice and partiality. He has free admittance into all courts and tribunals, that he may be the better enabled to give the viceroy an account of their proceedings.</P>
<P>The whole military force of Sicily, amounts at pre&s;|ent, from what I can learn, to 9500 men, about 1200 of which are cavalry. Many of their cities and for|tre&s;&s;es would require a very numerous garri&s;on to de|fend them: Particularly Me&s;&s;ina, Syracu&s;e, and Paler|mo: But indeed the &s;tate of their fortifications, as well as that of their artillery, is &s;uch, that (even if they were inclined) they could make but a &s;mall defence.</P>
<P>If this i&s;land were in the hands of a naval power, I think it is evident, that it mu&s;t command the whole Levant trade: There are &s;everal little ports at each end of it, be&s;ides the great ones of Trapani, Syracu&s;e,
<PB N="334" REF="024150_0344_0FC3D1AFAF35B950">
and Me&s;&s;ina, which lie pretty near the three angles of the triangle. Whatever &s;hips had pa&s;&s;ed either of the&s;e, the others could be appri&s;ed of in the &s;pace of half an hour, by means of &s;ignal towers, which the Sicilians have erected all around their i&s;land to warn them again&s;t &s;udden inva&s;ions from the Barbary &s;ide. The&s;e towers are built on every little promontory, within &s;ight of each other. Fires are always kept ready for lighting, and a per&s;on is appointed to watch at each of them, &s;o that the whole i&s;land can be alarmed, they a&s;&s;ure us, in the &s;pace of an hour.</P>
<P>By the bye, we have been witne&s;s here of a practice, that appears to be a very iniquitous one, and in the end, I &s;hould think, mu&s;t prove the de&s;truction of our Mediterranean trade. Several &s;hips have put in at this port with Engli&s;h colours, but to our &s;urpri&s;e, not one Engli&s;hman on board. The&s;e, I find, they call Bandiere men: Perhaps it is a known practice, al|though, I own, I was an utter &s;tranger to it. They are very numerous in the&s;e &s;eas, and carry on a con|&s;iderable trade through the whole of the Mediterranean, to the great detriment of our own &s;hips. Mo&s;t of them belong to Genoa and Sicily, though they pa&s;s under the name of Minorquins. They purcha&s;e Medi|terranean pa&s;&s;ports, I am told, from &s;ome of the gov|enors of our garri&s;ons, which entitles them, during the term &s;pecified in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ports, to trade under Engli&s;h colours. I am a&s;&s;ured that the number of the&s;e Bandi|ere men amounts to &s;ome hundreds. They have often one or two Engli&s;h &s;ailors on board; or at lea&s;t &s;ome per&s;on that &s;peaks the language, to an&s;wer when they are challenged. Pray can you tell me if this practice is known in England?</P>

<P>WE have now got every thing ready for our departure, and if the wind continues favourable, this is probably the la&s;t letter I &s;hall write you from Sicily. However, I had &s;till a great deal more to &s;ay, both of the Sicilians and their i&s;land, and &s;hall leave them, I a&s;&s;ure you with a good deal of regret.</P>
<P>Two chebecks &s;ailed this morning for Naples. We had the offer of a pa&s;&s;age; but had already enga|ged a little ve&s;&s;el for our&s;elves. A young nobleman, the marquis of &mdash;, was &s;hipped off in one of them, with orders never more to &s;et his foot in Palermo. Indeed we are much &s;urpri&s;ed that his &s;entence is &s;o mild, as he has been guilty of a crime which in catho|lic countries is generally puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t rigour; no le&s;s than the debauching a nun. He met with the young lady at a bathing-place, about thirty
<PB N="336" REF="024150_0346_0FC3D1B7EC7560D0">
miles from this, where &s;he had been &s;ent from her convent for the recovery of her health; her mother was along with her, but as the two young people were fir&s;t cou&s;ins, and had lived together like brother and &s;i&s;ter, the old lady thought there could be no ri&s;k in allowing them their wonted familiarity.</P>
<P>The nun &s;oon recovered her health, grew fat, and returned to her convent. This is about &s;ix or &s;even months ago; and it is only a few days &s;ince the fatal di&s;covery was made; but alas, it would conceal no longer. He is bani&s;hed Sicily for life; and his e&s;tate, or the greate&s;t part of it, is confi&s;cated. He may think him&s;elf happy they have treated him with &s;o much lenity: Had his jury been compo&s;ed of prie&s;ts and confe&s;&s;ors, he mu&s;t have died, without benefit of clergy; for this is the fir&s;t mortal &s;in, for which there is neither atonement nor ab&s;olution; <Q>to lie with a nun, and yet not be in orders.</Q></P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of the poor unfortunate girl is not yet determined: However, I am told, it will be a terrible one: Probably confinement in a dungeon for &s;even or eight years, without any company but a &s;kull and a crucifix; and to live all that time upon bread and water. I &s;aw a nun, at Portallegre in Portugal, that had &s;uffered this very puni&s;hment for the &s;ame crime.</P>
<P>This &s;tory has been kept a profound &s;ecret, and if we had not been on a very intimate footing with &s;ome people here, we never &s;hould have heard of it.</P>
<P>The Sicilians &s;till retain &s;ome of the Spani&s;h cu&s;|toms, though nothing of their gravity or taciturnity: The younger &s;ons of the nobility are &s;tiled Don by
<PB N="337" REF="024150_0347_0FC3D1BD867FD180">
their chri&s;tened names, and the daughters Donna; like our appellation of lord and lady to the &s;ons and daugh|ters of dukes. The elde&s;t &s;on has commonly the title of count or marquis, but they are not all counts as in France and Germany, where I have &s;een &s;ix counts in one hou&s;e, and very nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> twice the number of barons in another.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t common titles here, as well as at Naples, is that of Prince; and although the&s;e were only created by Philip II. of Spain, they take rank of all the other nobility, &s;ome of whom, particularly the counts, carry their origin as far back as the time of the Normans, and look with great contempt on the&s;e up&s;tart Princes. The dukes and marqui&s;&s;es are not &s;o old: The fir&s;t were created by Charles V. and the &s;econd, though an inferior title, by king Alphon&s;o, in the fifteenth century. So that the dignity of the Sicil|ian titles may be &s;aid to be in the inver&s;e ratio of their antiquities.</P>
<P>The luxury of the people here, like that of the Nea|politans, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in their equipages and hor&s;es; but by a wi&s;e law of the king of Sardinia, which I am &s;urpri&s;ed &s;hould &s;till remain in force, the viceroy alone is allowed to drive in the city with &s;ix hor&s;es; the prae|tor, the archbi&s;hop and pre&s;ident of the parliament with four; all the re&s;t of the nobility are re&s;tricted to two. But this is only within the gates of Palermo; and when they go to the country, there is none of them that drive with le&s;s than four: Be&s;ides, every family of di&s;|tinction has at lea&s;t two or three carriages in daily u&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for no man of fa&s;hion is &s;o unpolite as to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a chariot of her own, of which &s;he has the entire com|mand; (without this the Marino could never &s;ub&s;i&s;t;) and the upper &s;ervants of the fir&s;t families would be ju&s;t as much a&s;hamed to be &s;een on foot as their ma&s;ters.
<PB N="338" REF="024150_0348_0FC3D1BE99339960">
We took the liberty to ridicule the folly of this prac|tice: They allow of its ab&s;urdity, and wi&s;h to break through it; but who is to lead the way? We even prevailed with &s;ome of the young nobility, which I a&s;&s;ure you was no &s;mall conde&s;cen&s;ion, to walk the &s;treets with us during the illuminations; but even this conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;hewed the folly of the prejudice in a &s;tronger light than if they had refu&s;ed us; for they would not be prevailed on to &s;tir out, 'till they had &s;ent their &s;ervants about ten yards before them, with large wax flambeaux, although the whole city was in a flame of light. You may believe we did not &s;pare them upon this occa&s;ion; but it was all to no purpo&s;e. However, it is po&s;&s;ible that we may overlook many cu&s;toms of our own, that are not le&s;s ridiculous; for ridicule for the mo&s;t part is relative, and depends only on time and place. Perhaps you may remember the Prince of Anamaboo; I &s;hould like to hear the account he would give of the Engli&s;h nation in his own country; for &s;ome of our cu&s;toms &s;truck him in a &s;till more ridiculous light. Walking out in St. James's Park, in the afternoon, he ob&s;erved one of his acquaintance driving in a phaeton with four hor&s;es. The Prince bur&s;t into a violent fit of laughing: When they a&s;ked him what was the matter? "Vat the devil (&s;aid the Prince in his bad Engli&s;h) <Q>has that fellow eat &s;o much dinner that now it takes four hor&s;es to carry him? I rode out with him this morning, and he was then &s;o light, than van little hor&s;e ran away with him. He mu&s;t either be a great fool or a great glutton.</Q> Another time they in&s;i&s;ted on the Prince going to the play. He went; but he &s;oon tired of it, and returned to his Companions. <Q>Well, Prince, (&s;aid they) what did you &s;ee?</Q> "Vat did I &s;ee," (replied he with the utmo&s;t contempt) <Q>I did &s;ee &s;ome men playing de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and &s;ome men playing de fool.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="024150_0349_0FC3D1C014FA6838">I only infer from this, that it is with &s;ome degree of caution we &s;hould ridicule the cu&s;toms of other na|tions: A Sicilian, perhaps, would laugh with as much ju&s;tice at many of our cu&s;toms; that, for in&s;tance, of obliging people to drink when they have no inclination to it; that in the north of eating Soland gee&s;e before dinner, to give them an appetite; that of phy&s;icians and lawyers wearing enormous wigs, and many others that will naturally occur to you, none of which appear in the lea&s;t ridiculous to the people that practi&s;e them; who would no doubt defend them as &s;trenuou&s;ly as the Sicilians do the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying flambeaux before them during the great illumination. Indeed, they have ju&s;t now given us an admirable &s;pecimen of &s;ome of our ridicules, in one of their opera-dances, with which we have been a good deal entertained.</P>
<P>I believe I told you that the dancers are lately come from England: They have brought upon the &s;tage many of the capital London characters: The bucks, the maccaronies, the prigs, the cits, and &s;ome others &s;till more re&s;pectable: The&s;e are well &s;upported, and afford a good deal of laughing. But I am interrupted, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have given you a more particular account of them. Adieu. The heat is intolerable; and there is no po&s;&s;ibility of walking out. We com|plain without rea&s;on of our own climate; and king Charles's ob&s;ervation I am per&s;uaded was ju&s;t; "That there is hardly any climate, where, throughout the year, we can have &s;o much exerci&s;e in the open air."</P>

<P>THE Sicilians are animated in conver&s;ation, and their action for the mo&s;t part is &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o expre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="340" REF="024150_0350_0FC3D1C63A061C58">
of their &s;entiments, that without hearing what is &s;aid, one may comprehend the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e. We u&s;ed to think the French and Neapolitans great adepts in this art; but they are much outdone by the Sicilians, both in the variety and ju&s;tne&s;s of their ge&s;ticulation.</P>
<P>The origin of this cu&s;tom they carry &s;o far back as the time of the earlie&s;t tyrants of Syracu&s;e, who, to pre|vent con&s;piracies, had forbid their &s;ubjects, under the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties, to be &s;een in parties talking to|gether. This obliged them to invent a method of communicating their &s;entiments by dumb &s;how, which they pretend has been tran&s;mitted from generation to generation ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I think it is not at all improbable that this cu&s;tom too may have given the fir&s;t idea of comedy; as we find, that &s;ome &s;hort time after, Epicarmus, a native of that city, was the author of this invention.</P>
<P>The Sicilians 'till lately retained a great many fooli&s;h and &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms; but particularly in their marriage and funeral ceremonies; it would be tedious to give you an account of all the&s;e; &s;ome of them are &s;till practi&s;ed in the wild and mountainous parts of the i&s;land. As &s;oon as the marriage ceremony is perform|ed, two of the attendants are ready to cram a &s;poonful of honey into the mouths of the bride and bridegroom; pronouncing it emblematical of their love and union, which they hope will ever continue as &s;weet to their &s;ouls, as that honey is to their palates. They then begin to throw handfuls of wheat upon them, which is continued all the way to the hou&s;e of the bridegroom. This is probably the remains of &s;ome ancient rite to Ceres, their favourite divinity, and they think i cannot
<PB N="341" REF="024150_0351_0FC3D1CC4013E5C0">
fail of procuring them a numerous progeny: How|ever, the Sicilian women have no occa&s;ion for any charm to promote this, as, in general, they are abun|dantly prolific even without it: Fazzello gives an account of women having frequently upwards of forty children; and Carrera mentions one who had forty-&s;even.</P>
<P>The young couple are not allowed to ta&s;te of the marriage-fea&s;t; this they pretend is to teach them pa|tience and temperance; but when dinner is fini&s;hed, a great bone is pre&s;ented to the bridegroom by the bride's father, or one of her neare&s;t relations, who pronounces the&s;e words: <Q><HI>Rodi tu que&s;t' o&s;&s;o,</HI> &amp;c. Pick you this bone, for you have now taken in hand to pick one, which you will find much harder and of more difficult dige&s;tion.</Q> Perhaps this may have given ri&s;e to the common &s;aying, when one has under|taken any thing arduous or difficult, that <Q>He has got a bone to pick.</Q></P>
<P>The Sicilians, like mo&s;t other nations in Europe, carefully avoid marrying in the month of May, and look upon &s;uch marriages as extremely inau&s;picious. This piece of &s;uper&s;tition is as old, perhaps older than the time of the Romans, by who&s;e authors it is fre|quently mentioned; and by whom it has been tran&s;|mitted to almo&s;t every nation in Europe, It is &s;ome|what unaccountable, that &s;o ridiculous an idea, which can have no foundation in nature, &s;hould have &s;tood its ground for &s;o many ages. There are indeed other cu&s;toms &s;till more trivial, that are not le&s;s univer&s;al. That of making April fools on the fir&s;t day of that month; the ceremony of the cake on Twelfth-night; and &s;ome others that will occur to you, of which, no more than this, I have ever been able to learn the origins.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="024150_0352_0FC3D1CDF827AFC8">The marriages of the Sicilian nobility are celeba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted with great magnificence; and the number of elegant carriages produced on the&s;e occa&s;ions is a&s;toni&s;hing. I wanted to di&s;cover when this great luxury in car|riages had taken its ri&s;e; and have found an account of the marriage of the daughter of one of their viceroys to the duke of Bivona, in the year 1551. It is de|&s;cribed by one Elenco, who was a &s;pectator of the ceremony. He &s;ays the ladies as well as gentlemen were all mounted on fine hor&s;es, &s;umptuou&s;ly capari&s;|oned, and preceded by pages: That there were only three carriages in the city, which were u&s;ed by invalids who were not able to ride on hor&s;eback. The&s;e he calls <HI>Carette,</HI> which word now &s;ignifies a little cart.</P>
<P>The Sicilian ladies marry very young, and frequently live to &s;ee the fifth or &s;ixth generation. You will expect, no doubt, that I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething of their beauty. In general, they are &s;prightly and agreeable; and in mo&s;t parts of Italy they would be e&s;teemed hand&s;ome. A Neapolitan or a Roman would &s;urely pronounce them &s;o. But a Piedmonte&s;e would de|clare them very ordinary; &s;o indeed would mo&s;t Engli&s;hmen. Nothing &s;o vague as our ideas of female beauty: They change in every climate; and the criterion is no where to be found.
<Q><L>"A&s;k where's the North?&mdash;At York, 'tis on the Tweed,</L>
<L>"In Scotland at the Orcades, and there,</L>
<L>"At Nova Zembla, or the Lord knows where."</L></Q></P>
<P>No two nations, perhaps no two men, have affixed preci&s;ely the &s;ame characteri&s;tics; and every one ex|alts his idea of it, according to the beauty of the women he is accu&s;tomed to &s;ee; &s;o that even the &s;ame per&s;on may &s;ometimes appear beautiful, &s;ometimes ugly ju&s;t
<PB N="343" REF="024150_0353_0FC3D1D003454F90">
in proportion as we have &s;een others that are more or le&s;s &s;o. I remember, after making the tour of Savoy and the Lower Valais, every woman we met in Switzer|land appeared an angel. The &s;ame thing happens in travelling through &s;ome parts of Germany; and you will ea&s;ily recollect the &s;urpri&s;ing difference betwixt a beauty at Milan and one at Turin, altho' the&s;e places lie adja|cent to each other. It is pity a that the Juno of Zeuxis has been lo&s;t, if it were no more than to have &s;hewn us the notion the ancients had of a perfect beauty. Indeed, the Venus of Medicis has been con&s;idered as a model of perfection, but it is &s;urely ab&s;urd; for who ever heard of a perfect beauty of five feet high! the very idea is ridiculous; and whatever figure her god|de&s;s&s;hip might make among&s;t the ancient divinities, in the pantheon at Rome, I am afraid &s;he would cut but a &s;orry one among&s;t the modern ones, in that of Lon|don. In &s;hort, I believe we may &s;afely conclude, that beauty is a relative quality, and the <HI>to kalon</HI> is no longer the &s;ame, no more in a phy&s;ical than a moral &s;en&s;e, in any two places on the globe.</P>
<P>The ladies here have remarkable fine hair, and they under&s;tand how to dre&s;s and adorn it to the greate&s;t advantage. It is now only u&s;ed as an embelli&s;hment; but in former times we are told, that, like that of Samp&s;on, it was found to be the &s;trength and protec|tion of their country. There is a paradox for you, that all the wi&s;e men of the Ea&s;t could hardly &s;olve. Their hi&s;torians relate, (in who&s;e reign I believe is rather dubious) that this city had &s;uffered a long &s;iege from the Saracens and was greatly reduced by famine; but, what di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them &s;till more, there were no materials to be found for making bow&s;trings, and they were on the point of &s;urrendering. In this dilemma, a patriotic dame &s;tepped forth, and propo&s;ed to the wo|men,
<PB N="344" REF="024150_0354_0FC3D1D14EC520C0">
that the whole of them &s;hould cut off their hair, and twi&s;t it into bow-&s;trings: This was immediately complied with. The heroi&s;m of the women, you know, mu&s;t ever excite that of the men. The be&s;ieged, animated by this gallant &s;acrifice of the fair, renewed their defence with &s;uch vigour, that the a&s;&s;ailants were beat off; and a reinforcement &s;oon after arriving, the city was &s;aved. The ladies &s;till value them&s;elves on this &s;tory, which you may believe has not been forgot|ten by their bards. <Q>The hair of our ladies (&s;ays one of their quaint poets) is &s;till employed in the &s;ame office; but now it di&s;charges no other &s;hafts but tho&s;e of Cupid; and the only cords it forms are the cords of love.</Q></P>
<P>The Sicilians are much fonder of &s;tudy than their neighbours on the continent; and their education is much more attended to. We were a good deal &s;urpri|&s;ed to find, that in&s;tead of that frivolity and nothingne&s;s, which &s;o often con&s;titute the conver&s;ation of the Italian nobility, here their delight was to talk on &s;ubjects of literature, of hi&s;tory, of politics, but chiefly of poetry; for the other branches of knowledge and &s;cience are only general: This is the only one that may be &s;aid to be univer&s;al. Every per&s;on, in &s;ome period of his life is &s;ure to be in&s;pired; and a lover is never believed &s;o long as he can &s;peak of his pa&s;&s;ion in pro&s;e; and, contra|ry to our way of rea&s;oning, is only reckoned true in proportion as he is poetical. Thus, in&s;piration, you &s;ee, has here become the te&s;t of truth.</P>
<P>We were a&s;toni&s;hed on our fir&s;t arrival at Palermo, to hear our&s;elves addre&s;&s;ed in Engli&s;h by &s;ome of the young nobility; but &s;till more &s;o, to find them inti|mately acquainted with many of our celebrated poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and philo&s;ophers.

Pope, Bacon, Bolingbroke, we found in &s;everal libra|ries, not in the tran&s;lation, but generally in the be&s;t editions of the original.</P>
<P>Our language, indeed, has become &s;o much in vogue, that it is now looked upon as no immaterial part of a polite education: The viceroy, the Marquis Fogliano, a man of great merit and humanity, has made &s;ome of our authors his favourite &s;tudy, and greatly encourages the progre&s;s it is making in his kingdom. Many of the nobility &s;peak it a little; and &s;ome of them even with ea&s;e and fluency, although they have never been out of their i&s;land. The Marquis Natali, the Counts Statela and Bu&s;chemi, the Duke of St. Micheli, &amp;c. in who&s;e company we have enjoyed a great deal of plea&s;ure, and who&s;e knowledge and eru|dition is the lea&s;t part of their prai&s;e.

<P>I HAD almo&s;t forgot to &s;ay any thing of the opera: It would have been very ungrateful, for we have been much delighted with it. The fir&s;t and &s;econd man, are both admirable &s;ingers, and I make no doubt you will have them in London in a few years; neither of them are as yet known, and I dare &s;ay at pre&s;ent they might be engaged for a very moderate price; but in Italy they will &s;oon be taught to e&s;timate their value. The name of the fir&s;t is Pacherotti; he is very young,
<PB N="346" REF="024150_0356_0FC3D1D448873A40">
and an entire &s;tranger in the mu&s;ical world; yet I am per&s;uaded, that after he has been heard on the different theatres in Italy, he will be e&s;teemed one of their cap|ital performers. His excellence is the pathetic, at pre&s;ent too much neglected on mo&s;t theatres; and in|deed. I think, he gives more expre&s;&s;ion to his <HI>cantabile</HI> airs, and makes his hearers feel more, becau&s;e he feels more him&s;elf, than any that I have &s;een in Italy. He indeed addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the heart, while mo&s;t of the modern performers &s;ing only to the fancy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t woman is Gabrieli; who is certainly the greate&s;t &s;inger in the world: And tho&s;e that &s;ing on the &s;ame theatre with her, mu&s;t be capital, otherwi&s;e they can never be attended to. This indeed has been the fate of all the other performers, except Pacherotti; and he too gave him&s;elf up for lo&s;t, on hearing her fir&s;t performance. It happened to be an air of execution, exactly adapted to her voice, which &s;he exerted in &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a manner, that before it was half done, poor Pacherotti bur&s;t out a crying, and ran in behind the &s;cenes; lamenting that he had dared to appear on the &s;ame &s;tage with &s;o wonderful a &s;inger; where his &s;mall talents mu&s;t not only be lo&s;t, but where he mu&s;t ever be accu&s;ed of a pre&s;umption, which he hoped was foreign to his character.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome difficulty they could prevail on him to appear again, but from an applau&s;e well merited, both from his talents and his mode&s;ty, he &s;oon began to pluck up a little courage; and in the &s;inging of a tender air, addre&s;&s;ed to Gabrieli in the character of a lover, even &s;he her&s;elf, as well as the audience is &s;aid to have been moved.</P>
<P>Indeed, in the&s;e very pathetic pieces, I am &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="347" REF="024150_0357_0FC3D1D5CB857298">
that the power of the mu&s;ic does not &s;ometimes alto|gether overcome the delu&s;ion of character; for when you are ma&s;ter of the language, and allow the united power of the poetry, the action, and the mu&s;ic, to have its full force on the mind, the effect is wonderfully great. However, I have never heard that this happen|ed completely but once, and it was no le&s;s a &s;inger than Farinelli that produced it. He appeared in the cha|racter of a young captive hero, and in a tender air was &s;oliciting mercy for his mi&s;tre&s;s and him&s;elf, of a &s;tern and cruel tyrant who had made them his pri&s;oners. The per&s;on that acted the tyrant was &s;o perfectly overcome by the melting &s;trains of Farinelli, that in&s;tead of refu|&s;ing his reque&s;t as he ought to have done, he entirely forgot his character, bur&s;t into tears, and caught him in his arms.</P>
<P>The performance of Gabrieli is &s;o generally known and admired, that it is needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing to you on that &s;ubject. Her wonderful execution and volu|bility of voice have long been the admiration of Italy, and has even obliged them to invent a new term to expre&s;s it; and would &s;he exert her&s;elf as much to plea&s;e as to a&s;toni&s;h, &s;he might almo&s;t perform the wonders that have been a&s;cribed to Orpheus and Tim|otheus; but it happens, luckily perhaps for the repo&s;e of mankind, that her caprice is, if po&s;&s;ible, even greater than her talents, and has made her &s;till more contempt|ible than the&s;e have made her celebrated. By this means, her character has often proved a &s;ufficient anti|dote, both to the charms of her voice and tho&s;e of her per&s;on, which are indeed almo&s;t equally powerful; but if the&s;e had been united to the qualities of a mode&s;t and an amiable mind, &s;he mu&s;t have made dreadful hav|ock in the world. However, with all her faults, &s;he is certainly the mo&s;t dangerous &s;yren of modern times,
<PB N="348" REF="024150_0358_0FC3D1DC34D94048">
and has made more conque&s;ts, I &s;uppo&s;e, than any one woman breathing.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to add, that contrary to the gener|ality of her profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he is by no means &s;elfi&s;h or mercenary; but, on the contrary, has given many &s;in|gular proofs of genero&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. She is very rich; from the bounty, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of the la&s;t emperor, who was fond of having her at Vienna; but &s;he was at la&s;t bani&s;hed that city, as &s;he has like|wi&s;e been mo&s;t of tho&s;e in Italy, from the broils and &s;quabbles that her intriguing &s;pirit, perhaps &s;till more than her beauty, had excited. There are a great ma|ny anecdotes concerning her, that would not make an unentertaining volume; and, I am told, either are, or will &s;oon be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Although &s;he is con&s;iderably upwards of thirty, on the &s;tage &s;he &s;carcely appears to be eighteen, and this art of appearing young, is none of the mo&s;t contempt|ible that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. When &s;he is in good humour, and really chu&s;es to exert her&s;elf, there is nothing in mu&s;ic that I have ever heard, to be compared to her performance; for &s;he &s;ings to the heart as well as the fancy, when &s;he plea&s;es; and &s;he commands every pa&s;&s;ion with unbounded &s;way. But &s;he is capable of exerci&s;ing the&s;e wonderful powers; and her caprice and her talents exerting them&s;elves by turns, have giv|en her, all her life, the &s;ingular fate of becoming alter|nately an object of admiration and of contempt.</P>
<P>Her powers in acting and reciting, are &s;carcely in|ferior to tho&s;e of her &s;inging; &s;ometimes, a few words in the recitative, with a &s;imple accompaniment only, produces an effect, that I have never been &s;en&s;ible of from any other performer; and inclines me to believe
<PB N="349" REF="024150_0359_0FC3D1DD8300AD40">
what Rou&s;&s;eau advances on this branch of mu&s;ic, which with us is &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed. She owes much of her merit to the in&s;tructions &s;he received from Mete&s;ta&s;io, particularly in acting and reciting; and he allows that &s;he does more ju&s;tice to his operas than any other actre&s;s that ever attempted them.</P>
<P>Her caprice is &s;o fixed and &s;o &s;tubborn, that neither intere&s;t, nor flattery, nor threats, nor puni&s;hments, have the lea&s;t power over it; and it appears, that treat|ing her with re&s;pect or contempt, have an equal ten|dency to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom that &s;he conde&s;cends to exert the&s;e wonder|ful talents; but mo&s;t particularly if &s;he imagines that &s;uch an exertion is expected. And in&s;tead of &s;inging her airs as other actre&s;&s;es do, for the mo&s;t part &s;he only hums them over, <HI>a mezza voce.</HI> And no art whatever is capable of making her &s;ing, when &s;he does not chu&s;e it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful expedient has ever been found, to prevail on her favourite lover, for &s;he always has one, to place him&s;elf in the centre of the pit, or the front box; and if they are on good terms, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, &s;he will addre&s;s her tender airs to him, and exert her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t. Her pre&s;ent enamorato prom|i&s;ed to give us this &s;pecimen of his power over her; he took his place accordingly; but Gabrieli, probably &s;u&s;|pecting the connivance, would take no notice of him; &s;o that even this expedient does not always &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The viceroy, who is fond of mu&s;ic, has tried every method with her to no purpo&s;e. Sometime ago he gave a great dinner to the principal nobility of Palermo, and &s;ent an invitation to Gabrieli to be of the party.
<PB N="350" REF="024150_0360_0FC3D1DED2565DD0">
Every other per&s;on arrived at the hour of invitation. The viceroy ordered dinner to be kept back, and &s;ent to let her know that the company waited her. The me&s;&s;en|ger found her reading in bed; &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry for having made the company wait, and begged he would make her apology, but that really &s;he had entirely forgot her engagement.</P>
<P>The viceroy would have forgiven this piece of in|&s;olence, but, when the company came to the opera, Gabrieli repeated her part with the mo&s;t perfect neg|ligence and indifference, and &s;ung all her airs in what they call <HI>&s;otto voce,</HI> that is, &s;o low, that they can &s;carcely be heard. The viceroy was offended; but as he is a good-tempered man, he was loth to make u&s;e of au|thority; but at la&s;t, by a per&s;everance in this in&s;olent &s;tubbornne&s;s, &s;he obliged him to threaten her with puni&s;hment in ca&s;e &s;he any longer refu&s;ed to &s;ing.</P>
<P>On this &s;he grew more ob&s;tinate than ever, declar|ing that force and authority would never &s;ucceed her; that he might make her cry, but that he never could make her &s;ing. The viceroy then &s;ent her to pri&s;on, where &s;he remained twelve days. During which time, &s;he gave magnificent entertainments every day; paid the debts of all the poor pri&s;oners, and di&s;tributed large &s;ums in charity. The viceroy was obliged to give up &s;truggling with her, and &s;he was at la&s;t &s;et at liber|ty amid&s;t the acclamations of the poor. Luckily for us, &s;he is at pre&s;ent in good humour, and &s;ometimes exerts her&s;elf to the utmo&s;t of her power.</P>
<P>She &s;ays &s;he has &s;everal times been on terms with the managers of our opera, but thinks &s;he &s;hall never be able to pluck up re&s;olution enough to go to England. What do you think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her rea&s;on? It is by no means
<PB N="351" REF="024150_0361_0FC3D1E04A97F1D0">
a bad one. She &s;ays &s;he cannot command her caprice; but, for the mo&s;t part, that it commands her; and that there, &s;he could have no opportunity of indulging it: For, &s;ays &s;he, were I to take it into my head not to &s;ing, I am told the people there would certainly mob me, and perhaps break my bones; now I like to &s;leep in a &s;ound &s;kin, although it &s;hould even be in a pri&s;on. She alledges too that it is not always caprice that pre|vents her from &s;inging; but that it often depends upon phy&s;ical cau&s;es; and this indeed I can readily believe: For that wonderful flexibility of voice that runs with &s;uch rapidity and neatne&s;s through the mo&s;t minute divi&s;ions, and produces almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;o great a variety of modulation, mu&s;t &s;urely depend on the very nice&s;t tone of the fibres. And if the&s;e are in the &s;mall|e&s;t degree relaxed, or their ela&s;ticity dimini&s;hed; how is it po&s;&s;ible that their contractions and expan&s;ions can &s;o readily obey the will, as to produce the&s;e effects? The opening of the glottis which forms the voice, is extremely &s;mall, and in every variety of tone, its diam|eter mu&s;t &s;uffer a &s;en&s;ible change; for the &s;ame diame|ter mu&s;t ever produce the &s;ame tone: So wonderfully minute are its contractions and dilatations, that Dr. Keil, I think, computes, that in &s;ome voices, its open|ing, not more than the tenth of an inch, is divided into upwards of 1200 parts, the different &s;ound of every one of which is perceptible to an exact ear. Now, what a nice ten&s;ion of fibres mu&s;t this require! I &s;hould imagine every the mo&s;t minute change in the air, mu&s;t cau&s;e a &s;en&s;ible difference, and that in our foggy climate the fibres would be in danger of lo&s;ing this wonderful &s;en&s;ibility; or at lea&s;t, that they would very often be put out of tune. It is not the &s;ame ca&s;e with an ordinary voice; where the variety of divi&s;ions run through, and the volubility with which they are executed, bear no proportion to tho&s;e of a Gabrieli.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="024150_0362_0FC3D1E5E0D1FA40">One of the ballets of our opera, is a repre&s;entation of Vauxhall gardens, and this is the third time that I have &s;een Vauxhall brought upon the Italian theatre; at Turin, at Naples, and here. The gardens are well repre&s;ented, and the idea mu&s;t have been given by &s;ome per&s;on that had been on the &s;pot. A variety of good Engli&s;h figures are brought in: Some with large frizzled wigs &s;ticking half a yard out behind their necks; &s;ome with lit|tle cut &s;cratches, that look extremely ridiculous. Some come in cracking their whips, with buck&s;kin breeches and jockey caps. Some are armed with great oaken-&s;ticks; their hair tied up in enormous clubs, and &s;tocks that &s;well their necks to double the natural &s;ize. But what affords the principal part of the entertainment is, three quakers who are duped by three ladies of the town, in concert with three jack-tars, their lovers. The&s;e characters, as you may believe, are much exag|gerated, though, upon the whole, they are &s;upported with humour, and have afforded us a good deal of laughing; however, we were hurt to &s;ee the re&s;pecta|ble character of quakers turned into &s;uch ridicule; and as the people here were altogether unacquainted with it, we have been at &s;ome pains to explain to them the &s;implicity and purity of their manners, and the incor|ruptible integrity of their principles.</P>
<P>Although the Sicilians in general are a good &s;ort of people, and &s;eem to be endowed with a large &s;hare of philanthropy and urbanity; yet it mu&s;t be owned they have no great affection for their neighbours on the continent; and indeed the di&s;like is altogether recip|rocal. It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular; I am afraid not much for the honor of human nature; that through all Europe, the two neighbouring nations have a per|petual jarring with each other. I could heartily wi&s;h that we had been an exception from this rule; but am
<PB N="353" REF="024150_0363_0FC3D1E6FAA4D910">
&s;orry to &s;ee from our new&s;papers, which are &s;ent to the nobility of this city, that at pre&s;ent we are rather the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for it; at lea&s;t our animo&s;ities, if there really are any, make by much the greate&s;t noi&s;e of all. We have often been a&s;ked by foreign|ers what was the ground of the mighty quarrel, that &s;uch torrents of the mo&s;t illiberal abu&s;e have been poured out by a people &s;o celebrated for liberality of &s;entiment; and it is with difficulty we can per&s;uade them, that although from the papers, this &s;ometimes appears to be the voice of the nation, yet in fact, it is only confined to a &s;et of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and de&s;|picable incendiaries; like him who &s;et the hou&s;e in a flame, on purpo&s;e to pilfer during the conflagration. But the abu&s;e that is levelled at the king, &s;urpri&s;es them more than all the re&s;t; and you cannot conceive their amazement and indignation when we a&s;&s;ured them, that notwith&s;tanding all this, he was the mo&s;t virtuous and benevolent prince on earth. Then, exclaimed a Sicilian nobleman, you mu&s;t certainly be the mo&s;t damnable people on the globe. I was a good deal &s;truck with the &s;uddenne&s;s of the charge; and it was not without many explanations of the liberty of our con&s;titution, and particularly that of the pre&s;s, that I could prevail with him to retract his &s;entiments; and think more favourably of us. Still he in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;o egregious an abu&s;e of this liberty, was only a farther proof of his po&s;ition; and that there mu&s;t be &s;omething e&s;&s;entially wrong, in a nation that could allow of &s;uch abu&s;e levelled at the mo&s;t &s;acred of all characters: The highe&s;t virtue united to the highe&s;t &s;tation. We a&s;&s;ured him that what he heard, was only the voice of the mo&s;t abandoned and profligate wretches in the nation; who, taking advan|tage of the great freedom of the pre&s;s, had often made the&s;e new&s;papers the vehicles of the mo&s;t dete&s;|table

&s;edition. That both the king and queen were beloved by all their &s;ubjects, at lea&s;t by all tho&s;e of worth;&mdash;that they never were &s;poken of, but as the mo&s;t perfect model of conjugal union and happine&s;s, as well as of every &s;ocial endowment; and that they could have no enemies, but the enemies of virtue.</P>
<P>However, after all, we could but patch up a peace with him. He could not comprehend (he &s;aid) how the voice of a few incendiaries &s;hould be louder than the general voice of the nation. We told him, that people who were plea&s;ed commonly held their tongue; and that &s;edition and libel ever made a greater noi&s;e than panegyric; ju&s;t as the fire-bell is rung louder, and is more li&s;tened to than the bell for rejoicing.</P>
<P>Adieu. Our pilot &s;ays the wind is not fair, &s;o that po&s;&s;ibly we may &s;till &s;tay a day or two longer.</P>

<P>WERE I to enter upon the natural hi&s;tory of this i&s;land, it would lead me into a va&s;t field of &s;pecu|lation, for which I have neither time nor abilities: However, a variety of objects &s;truck us as we travelled along, that it may not be ami&s;s to give you &s;ome account of. There are a variety of mineral waters, almo&s;t through the whole of Sicily. Many of the&s;e are boiling hot; others &s;till more &s;ingular, are of a degree of cold &s;uperior to that of ice, and yet never freeze.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="024150_0365_0FC3D1ED37EB3B38">In &s;everal places, they have fountains that throw up a kind of oil on their &s;urface, which is of great u&s;e to the pea&s;ants, who burn it in their lamps, and u&s;e it to many other purpo&s;es; but there is &s;till a more remark|able one near Nico&s;ia which is called <HI>Il Fonte Canalotto.</HI> It is covered with a thick &s;cum of a kind of pitch, which among&s;t the country people is e&s;teemed a &s;ove|reign remedy in rheumatic, and many other com|plaints.</P>
<P>The water of a &s;mall lake near Na&s;o is celebrated for dying black every thing that is put into it; and this it is &s;aid to perform without the mixture of any other ingredient, although the water it&s;elf is remarkably pure and tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>They have a variety of &s;ulphureous baths, like tho&s;e near Naples, where the patient is thrown into a pro|fu&s;e &s;weat, only from the heat of the vapour. The mo&s;t celebrated are tho&s;e of Sciaccia, and on the mountain of St. Cologero; not in the neighbourhood of Aetna, as I expected, but at a great di&s;tance from that mountain. But indeed I am much inclined to believe, that not only mount Aetna, but the greate&s;t part of Sicily, and almo&s;t the whole of the circumja|cent i&s;lands, have been originally formed by &s;ubterra|neous fire; but I &s;hall have an opportunity of &s;peaking more largely on this &s;ubject, when I give you an account of the country round Naples.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved lava, pumice, and tu&s;a in many parts of Sicily, at a great di&s;tance from Aetna; and there are a variety both of mountains and vallies that &s;till emit a hot vapour, and produce &s;prings of boiling water.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="024150_0366_0FC3D1EE899016F0">About a mile and a half to the we&s;t of this city, at a &s;mall beach where we often go a &s;wimming, there are many &s;prings of warm water, that ri&s;e even within the &s;ea, at the depth of five or &s;ix feet. We were at fir&s;t a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to find our&s;elves almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly both in the hot and cold bath; for at one &s;troke we commonly pa&s;&s;ed through the hot water, which only extends for a few feet around the &s;pring. It gave us a momentary glow, and produced a very odd, uncouth &s;en&s;ation, by no means an agreeable one. I mentioned this &s;ingularity to &s;everal gentlemen here, who tell me they have ob&s;erved the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>Not a great way from this is a celebrated fountain, called <HI>Il Mar Dolce,</HI> where there are &s;ome remains of an ancient naumachia; and in the mountain above it, they &s;hew you a cavern, where a gigantic &s;keleton is &s;aid to have been found; however, it fell to du&s;t when they attempted to remove it; Fazzello &s;ays, its teeth were the only part that re&s;i&s;ted the impre&s;&s;ion of the air; that he procured two of them, and that they weighed near two ounces. There are many &s;uch &s;tories to be met with in the Sicilian legends, as it &s;eems to be an univer&s;al belief, that this i&s;land was once inhabited by giants; but although we have made diligent inquiry, we have never yet been able to procure a &s;ight of any of the&s;e gigantic bones which are &s;aid to be &s;till pre&s;erved in many parts of the i&s;land. Had there been any foundation for this, I think it is probable, they mu&s;t have found their way into &s;ome of the mu&s;eums; but this is not the ca&s;e; nor indeed have we met with any per&s;on of &s;en&s;e and credibility that could &s;ay they had &s;een any of them. We had been a&s;&s;ured at Naples, that an entire &s;kelet|on, upwards of ten feet high, was pre&s;erved in the mu&s;eum of Palermo; but there is no &s;uch thing there,
<PB N="357" REF="024150_0367_0FC3D1F3C28D1380">
nor I believe any where el&s;e in the i&s;land. This mu|&s;eum is well furni&s;hed both with antiques and articles of natural hi&s;tory, but is not &s;uperior to what we have &s;een in many other places.</P>
<P>The number of &s;ouls in Palermo are computed at about 150,000. Tho&s;e of the whole i&s;land, by the la&s;t numeration, amounted to 1,123,163; of which number there are about 50,000 that belong to the dif|ferent mona&s;teries and religious orders. The number of hou&s;es are computed at 268,120, which makes betwixt five and &s;ix to a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The great &s;tanding commodity of Sicily, which has ever con&s;tituted the riches of the i&s;land, was their crops of wheat; but they cultivate many other branches of commerce, though none that could bear any propor|tion to this, were it under a free government, and exportation allowed. Their method of pre&s;erving their grain will appear &s;omewhat &s;ingular to our farmers: In&s;tead of expo&s;ing it as we do, to the open air, they are at the greate&s;t pains to exclude it entirely from it. In many places, where the &s;oil is dry, par|ticularly near Agrigentum, they have dug large pits or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the rock. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> open by a &s;mall hole at top, and &s;well to a great width below; here they pour down their grain, after it has been made exceedingly dry; and ramming it hard, they cover up the hole, to protect it from rain; and they a&s;&s;ure us it will pre&s;erve in this manner for many years.</P>
<P>The Soda is a plant that is much cultivated, and turns out to con&s;iderable account. This is the veget|able, that by the action of fire, is afterwards converted into mirrors and cry&s;tals. Great quantities of it are &s;ent every year to &s;upply the gla&s;s-hou&s;es at Venice.
<PB N="358" REF="024150_0368_0FC3D1F54B0C6A38">
They have likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable trade in liquorice, rice, figs, rai&s;ins, and currants, the be&s;t of which grow among&s;t the extingui&s;hed volcanoes of the Lipari I&s;lands. Their honey is I think, the highe&s;t flavoured I have ever &s;een; in &s;ome parts of the i&s;land even &s;uperi|or to that of Minorca: This is owing, no doubt to the quantity of aromatic plants, with which this beautiful country is every where over&s;pread. This honey is gathered three months in the year; July, Augu&s;t, and October. It is found by the pea&s;ants in the hollows of trees and rocks; and is e&s;teemed of a &s;uperior quality to that produced under the tyranny of man. The country of the Le&s;&s;er Hybla is &s;till, as formerly, the part of the i&s;land that is mo&s;t celebrated for honey. The Count Statela made us a pre&s;ent of &s;ome of it, gathered on his brother the prince of Spaccaforno's e&s;tate, which lies near the ruins of that city.</P>
<P>Sugar is now no article of the Sicilian commerce, though a &s;mall quantity of it is &s;till manufactured for home con&s;umption; but the plantations of the &s;ugar|cane, I am told, thrive well in &s;everal parts of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The juice of liquori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prepared both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Calabria, and is &s;ent to the northern countries of Eu|rope, where it is u&s;ed for colds. The juice is &s;queezed out of the roots; after which it is boiled to a con&s;i&s;ten|cy, and formed into cakes, which are packed up with bay-leaves in the &s;ame order that we receive them.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the northern parts of the i&s;land, I am told, they find the &s;hell-fi&s;h that produces a kind of flax, of which gloves and &s;tockings are made; but the&s;e two are found in greater quantities in Calabria.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="024150_0369_0FC3D1FA614793B8">Their plantations of oranges, lemons, bergamots, almonds, &amp;c. produce no incon&s;iderable branch of commerce. The pi&s;tachio-nut too is much cultiva|ted in many parts of the i&s;land, and with great &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e trees, like many others, are male and female: The male is called <HI>Scornobecco,</HI> and is always barren; but unle&s;s a quantity of the&s;e are mixed in every plan|tation, the pi&s;tachio-tree never bears a nut. But of all the variety that is cultivated in Sicily, the manna-tree is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t profitable; it re&s;embles the a&s;h, and is I believe of that &s;pecies. About the be|ginning of Augu&s;t, during the &s;ea&s;on of the greate&s;t heat, they make an inci&s;ion in the bark, near to the root of the tree; a thick whiti&s;h liquor is immediately di&s;charged from the wound, which &s;oon hardens in the &s;un, when it is carefully taken off and gathered into boxes. They renew the&s;e inci&s;ions every day during the &s;ea&s;on, ob&s;erving, however, only to wound one &s;ide of the tree; the other &s;ide they re&s;erve for the &s;ummer following.</P>
<P>The cantharides-fly is a Sicilian commodity: It is found on &s;everal trees of Aetna, who&s;e juice is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a corro&s;ive or ab&s;ter&s;ive quality, particularly the pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and the fig-tree; and I am told the cantha|rides of Mount Aetna are reckoned preferable to tho&s;e of Spain.</P>
<P>The marbles of Sicily would afford a great &s;ource of opulence, were there any encouragement to work the quarries: Of the&s;e they have an infinite variety, and of the fine&s;t &s;orts. I have &s;een &s;ome of them little infe|rior to the giall and verd antiqua, that is now &s;o pre|cious. The beautiful yellow columns you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved in the royal chapel of Ca&s;&s;erto are of the fir&s;t kind. They have likewi&s;e &s;ome that very much re&s;em|ble lapis lazuli and porphyry.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="024150_0370_0FC3D1FB77886670">At Centorbi they find a kind of &s;oft &s;tone that di&s;|&s;olves in water, and is u&s;ed in wa&s;hing in&s;tead of &s;oap, from which property it is called <HI>Pietra Saponaro.</HI> They likewi&s;e find here, as well as in Calabria, the celebrated &s;tone, which, upon being watered and expo&s;ed to a pretty violent degree of heat, produces a plentiful crop of mu&s;hrooms: But it would be endle&s;s to give you an account, of all the various commodities and curious productions of this i&s;land; Aetna alone affords a greater number than many of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive kingdoms, and is no le&s;s an epitome of the whole earth in its &s;oil and climate, than in the variety of its productions. Be&s;ides the corn, the wine, the oil, the &s;ilk, the &s;pice, and delicious fruits of its lower region; the beautiful fore&s;ts, the flocks, the game, the tar, the cork, the honey, of its &s;econd; the &s;now and ice of its third; it affords from its caverns a variety of mineral and other productions; cinnabar, mercury, &s;ulphur, alum, nitre, and vitriol; &s;o that this wonderful mountain at the &s;ame time produces every nece&s;&s;ary, and every luxury of life.</P>
<P>Its fir&s;t region covers their tables with all the delica|cies that the earth produces; its &s;econd &s;upplies them with game, chee&s;e, butter, honey; and not only fur|ni&s;hes wood of every kind for building their &s;hips and hou&s;es, but likewi&s;e an inexhau&s;tible &s;tore of excellent fewel; and as the third region, with its ice and &s;now, keeps them fre&s;h and cool during the heat of &s;ummer, &s;o this contributes equally to keep them warm and comfortable during the cold of winter.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, the variety of climates is not confined to Aetna it&s;elf; but, in obedience to the voice of man, de&s;cends from that mountain; and, mingling the vio|lence of their extremes, diffu&s;es the mo&s;t benign influ|ences
<PB N="361" REF="024150_0371_0FC3D1FCB421BBD0">
all over the i&s;land, tempering each other to moderation, and &s;oftening the rigours of every &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>We are not then to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the ob&s;tinate at|tachment of the people to this mountain, and that all his terrors have not been able to drive them away from him: For although he &s;ometimes cha&s;ti&s;es; yet, like an indulgent parent, he mixes &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings along with his cha&s;ti&s;ements, that their affections can never be e&s;tranged; for at the &s;ame time that he threatens with a rod of iron, be pours down upon them all the ble&s;|&s;ings of the age of gold.</P>
<P>Adieu. We are now going to pay our re&s;pects to the viceroy, and make our farewell vi&s;its. This cere|mony never fails to throw a damp on my &s;pirits; but I have &s;eldom found it &s;o &s;trong as at pre&s;ent, there being little or no probability that we &s;hall ever &s;ee again a number of worthy people we are ju&s;t now going to take leave of, or that we &s;hall never have it in our power to make any return for the many civilities we have received from them.</P>
<P>Farewell. The wind we are told is fair, and I &s;hall probably be the bearer of this to the continent, from whence you may &s;oon expect to hear from, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Naples <DATE>Augu&s;t 1&s;t.</DATE></HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER two days delightful &s;ailing, we have again arrived in this city; where, to our infinite joy; we have
<PB N="362" REF="024150_0372_0FC3D1FE50538120">
found all the worthy friends we had left behind us. This indeed was nece&s;&s;ary, to wipe out the impre&s;&s;ions which the leaving of Sicily had occa&s;ioned. We &s;hall &s;till remain here, at lea&s;t for three months, 'till the &s;ea|&s;on of the <HI>Mal Aria</HI> is entirely over. You know the danger of travelling through the Campania during that &s;ea&s;on; which although it is looked upon by many of our learned doctors as a vulgar error, yet we cer|tainly &s;hall not &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the experiment.</P>
<P>We propo&s;e to pa&s;s the winter at Rome, where we &s;hall probably find occupation enough for four or five months. From thence by Loretto, Bologna, &amp;c. to Venice; the old beaten track. We &s;hall then leave the parched fields of Italy, for the delightful cool mountains of Switzerland; where liberty and &s;im|plicity, long &s;ince bani&s;hed from poli&s;hed nations, &s;till flouri&s;h in their original purity; where the tempera|ture and moderation of the climate, and that of the inhabitants are mutually emblematical of each other. For whil&s;t other nations are &s;corched by the heat of the &s;un, and the &s;till more &s;corching heats of tyran|ny and &s;uper&s;tition; here the genial breezes for ever fan the air, and heighten that alacrity and joy which liberty and innocence alone can in&s;pire; here the genial flow of the &s;oul has never yet been checked by the idle and u&s;ele&s;s refinement of art; but opens and expands it&s;elf to all the calls of affection and be|nevolence. But I mu&s;t &s;top. You know my old attachment to that primitive country. It never fails to run away with me. We propo&s;e then, to make this the &s;cene of our &s;ummer plea&s;ures; and by that time, I can fore&s;ee, we &s;hall be heartily tired of Art, and &s;hall begin again to langui&s;h after Nature. It is &s;he alone that can give any real or la&s;ting plea&s;ure, and in all our pur&s;uits of happine&s;s if &s;he is not our guide, we never can attain our end.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="024150_0373_0FC3D202C7BD23E0">Adieu, my dear friend. You have been our faith|ful companion during this Tour, and have not con|tributed a little to its plea&s;ure.

A man mu&s;t have a mi&s;erable imagination indeed, that can be in &s;olitude, whil&s;t he has &s;uch friends to conver&s;e with; the con&s;ideration of it &s;oon removes the moun|tains and the &s;eas that &s;eparate us, and produces tho&s;e &s;ympathetic feelings, which are the only equivalent for the real ab&s;ence of a friend; for I never &s;it down to write, but I &s;ee you placed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the table, and &s;uppo&s;e that we are ju&s;t talking over the tran&s;actions of the day.
