<HEAD>DEDICATION TO THE YOUNG MEN OF THE FIRST PARISH IN FALMOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fit and rea&s;onable that I devote and dedi|cate the following Sermons to you; becau&s;e they are already your own, in &s;everal re&s;pects. And though I wi&s;h them to &s;erve the be&s;t intere&s;ts of other &s;orts of per&s;ons, as well as other per&s;ons of your &s;tanding, it is confe&s;&s;ed you have by far the greate&s;t intere&s;t in them.</P>
<P>THOUGH it is po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ubject of them might have been handled, even by me, in a man|ner le&s;s exceptionable to the learned, if I had expect|ed they would ever have had the opportunity to critici&s;e on them: yet as all who are candid, when they perceive the de&s;ign to be evidently laudable, will be di&s;po&s;ed to overlook &s;mall faults, and to &s;peak as favourably as po&s;&s;ible of greater ones; I have, after &s;erious deliberation, determined to give them to you and to the publick, without any mate|rial alterations, additions or amendments: becau&s;e
<PB N="iv" REF="013238_0003_0F90452960C413A8">I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have given you an opportunity to charge me with unfairne&s;s, in not granting in fact the thing you reque&s;ted of me, a copy of the &s;ermons I preached to young men.</P>
<P>THE method and &s;entiments are as entirely my own, as it is po&s;&s;ible for you to conceive: and yet it is highly probable I may have &s;aid the &s;ame things, in my poor manner, which many excellent writers have favoured the world with, in a mo&s;t elegant and plea&s;ing dre&s;s. For I &s;uppo&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to treat this &s;ubject with any tolerable propriety, or &s;o as to be any ways u&s;eful, without &s;aying many things that have often been &s;aid before; and next to impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay any thing very pertinent that is new. I have neither followed, nor knowingly &s;hunned, in any degree, tho&s;e who have gone before me; nor could I have done either, if I had been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as I had no book of this &s;ort by me; nor near me that I knew of. But very &s;eriou&s;ly and in the fear of God, I delivered to you, without any &s;trict regard to method, what was prompted by an heart anxiou&s;ly concerned to promote your happi|ne&s;s, and much devoted to your &s;ervice. And this not with any de&s;ign or view of recommending my|&s;elf to the publick, as I had not any expectation, when I compo&s;ed the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, of their becoming more publick than once preaching would make them: but with a pure intent, I hope I may &s;ay, to &s;erve your &s;piritual and eternal intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="013238_0004_0F90452987EA2750">
I AM aware that many will be ready to call me ra&s;h and unadvi&s;ed, for venturing this imperfect performance abroad in the world, after the many excellent publications upon &s;ubjects nearly the &s;ame: and e&s;pecially, after an extraordinary genius, of our own country, has publi&s;hed a great number of &s;ermons upon the very &s;ame text. But as the books I &s;peak of are not in your hands, and perhaps never will be; this is, at once, a rea&s;on why you have reque&s;ted it, and an apology to the publick for my con&s;enting to yield to your reque&s;t of the pub|lication of this work; e&s;pecially as none can blame me for my di&s;po&s;ition to gratify you in every thing that is rea&s;onable. The zeal you have &s;hewn in this matter, makes me entertain a plea&s;ing hope, that you will &s;eriou&s;ly attend to the very important re|ligious truths, which are here laid before you; and thereby, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, gain &s;ome real and la&s;ting benefit from them. If this end can but be an&s;wered, I am the le&s;s concerned for my repu|tation as a writer.</P>
<P>IT is often &s;aid, and perhaps not without rea&s;on, that the world is already too much filled with books of divinity. But this &s;aying chiefly refers, I &s;up|po&s;e, to tho&s;e which are &s;peculative and polemical; of a nature and tendency very different from this; in which di&s;puted principles and theological niceties are avoided. But if the multiplication of books upon practical &s;ubjects will be a probable means of
<PB N="vi" REF="013238_0005_0F90452ADC00E648">increa&s;ing practical religion, which is &s;o much wanted among us, who will be again&s;t multiplying them? And if the oftener young men are exhorted to attend to the important affairs of their &s;ouls and eternity, the more ground of hope there is that they will do &s;o, who can think any mini&s;ter's endeavours to this purpo&s;e needle&s;s? And that this little book will be diligently peru&s;ed by you, becau&s;e of the unmerited regard I find many of you have for the author, I have doubtle&s;s good rea&s;on to expect.&mdash; As al&s;o, that you will be di&s;po&s;ed to do all in your power, to cau&s;e others to give &s;ome attention to it. And it is &s;trange, if even an unprejudiced attention to the matters herein contained will do you no good. If the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es may, among the other means of grace that you enjoy, contribute any thing towards making &s;erious and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on you, and other young per&s;ons into who&s;e hands they may come, I &s;hall think my labour well &s;pent. For no man has a deeper &s;en&s;e than I of the nece&s;&s;ity of early piety, and of the importance of the ri&s;ing generation. And with regard to you, my dear friends, in particular, I may &s;ay as the Apo&s;tle Paul did to the Philippian Chri&s;tians, <Q>God is my record, how greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> And that none of you may "fail of the grace of God," is the fervent prayer of</P>

<HEAD>SERMONS to YOUNG MEN. SERMON I.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>TITUS II. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Young men likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Epi&s;tle was &s;ent by the apo&s;tle Paul, to Titus, a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel and evangeli&s;t, then in Crete, to direct him, not only how to conduct him&s;elf towards the Judaizing teachers; but more e&s;pecially how to behave in his mini&s;try; both in ordaining church-officers, and in preaching the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IN the paragraph where our text is in&s;erted, di|rections are given to Titus, in what manner to ex|hort &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons; that &s;o he might <Q>rightly divide the word of truth, and give to every one his portion in due &s;ea&s;on.</Q> In the fir&s;t place, he is directed how to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the aged men; then to the aged women; and nextly, in our text, how to exhort the young men.</P>
<P>BY young men, I make no &s;cruple, the apo&s;tle meant all men under middle age. For it is mo&s;t likely, as he mentions old and young men near to|gether, that he meant to include all the men under
<PB N="2" REF="013238_0008_0F90452C93C87018">the&s;e two kinds. If otherwi&s;e, it would follow, that &s;ome of the men Titus is not directed here to exhort at all; which appears highly improbable, when we con&s;ider how many different &s;orts of people are mentioned as the &s;ubjects of his particular addre&s;&s;es. Therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf, in the following &s;ermons, as &s;peaking to all the males of the congre|gation, who are arrived to manhood, and are not yet come to what is commonly e&s;teemed the middle of life. But I &s;hall have, all along, a more &s;pecial regard to tho&s;e who are yet in their youth; and who are, in common &s;peech, denominated young men.</P>
<P>THE Cretan young men, you &s;ee, were to be ex|horted by their mini&s;ter to be &s;ober-minded.&mdash; Doubtle&s;s then it is the duty of every mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, in like manner, to exhort all the young men, who are under their pa&s;toral care. And it is equally the duty of young men, in every Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, candidly and &s;eriou&s;ly to hearken to &s;uch exhorta|tions. The former infers the latter; for to what end are mini&s;ters to exhort, if they are not to be attended to? While they exhort according as they are directed in God's word, their exhortations ought to be received, "not as the word of man, but as the word of God."</P>
<P>BUT I hope none of my readers will think them|&s;elves unintere&s;ted in the en&s;uing exhortations. For religion is &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame in all per&s;ons; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to teach young men their duty as Chri&s;tians, without teaching, at the &s;ame time, the duty of all per&s;ons. I mu&s;t e&s;pecially be allowed to hope for the &s;erious attention of young women;
<PB N="3" REF="013238_0009_0F90452D441E90C0">for I know of no argument I can u&s;e, to per&s;wade young men to be &s;ober-minded, that does not hold good why young women &s;hould be &s;o too.</P>
<P>THE method I propo&s;e in di&s;cour&s;ing on this &s;ubject is,</P>
<P>FIRST. To &s;hew what is to be under&s;tood by being &s;ober-minded.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To exhort and per&s;wade young men to be &s;o, by &s;everal arguments and motives. And</P>
<P>THIRDLY. To direct tho&s;e what methods to take, who de&s;ire to obtain and cultivate inward &s;obriety.</P>
<P>FIRST. I am to &s;hew what is to be under&s;tood by being &s;ober-minded.</P>
<P>THE original word, which is here rendered &s;ober|minded, is &s;ophronein. The meaning of which is, to be &s;ober, or to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> mind. But</P>
<P>SOBRIETY, according to the u&s;e of the word in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, means the oppo&s;ite to all &s;inful lu&s;t, of which, by the way, it is likely young men are, upon the whole, in greater danger than other &s;orts of per&s;ons. Appetite in them is very &s;trong; and rea&s;on, wherewith they &s;hould curb and re&s;train their appetites, is not yet arrived to its highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>To be &s;ober, as the word is u&s;ed in the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the context, means, at mo&s;t, to avoid all tho&s;e &s;ins, irregularities and exce&s;&s;es, into which our &s;en&s;es and natural appetites are apt to hurry us; or it is avoiding gluttony, drunkenne&s;s, concupi&s;cent un|cleanne&s;s, luxury, and the like. And this is the mo&s;t common and familiar &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="013238_0010_0F90452E0C579F48">
BUT avoiding the&s;e, and all other outward acts of &s;en&s;uality, is not alone &s;ufficient to denominate a man "&s;ober minded." They who would de&s;erve this character, mu&s;t have a frame and temper of mind habitually corre&s;pondent to external &s;obriety. They mu&s;t not only avoid all outward debauchery; but they mu&s;t be cha&s;te and moderate in their tho'ts and meditations. The man who cheri&s;hes unclean and &s;en&s;ual de&s;ires, de&s;igns and affections in his heart, &s;ins again&s;t the laws of &s;obriety, as really, though it may be, not &s;o gro&s;sly and heinou&s;ly, as if he had committed the outward acts. For our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has told us, <Q>who&s;oever looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed adul|tery with her already in his heart.</Q> And we are thus cautioned by the wi&s;e king Solomon, <Q>look not thou on the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it&s;elf aright;</Q> that is, avoid tho&s;e things, which tend to excite an inordinate appetite in you, for wine or any other &s;trong drink. A mind that dwells much upon forbidden plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, is not a &s;ound mind; but a mind &s;adly di&s;ordered, and full of corruption; and &s;o it is directly the rever&s;e of what is required of young men in the text.</P>
<P>AND if the heart mu&s;t be regulated, &s;urely the tongue mu&s;t al&s;o, which is the index of the heart. If the tongue is full of "filthine&s;s, fooli&s;h talking and je&s;ting," which the apo&s;tle cautions us again&s;t; or even taken up with inquiring "what we &s;hall eat and drink," or how the &s;en&s;es are to be immo|derately indulged, in any re&s;pect; it will but too
<PB N="5" REF="013238_0011_0F90452EE2B52D78">&s;urely prove that the heart is debauched, and that we are de&s;titute of internal &s;obriety; for <Q>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh.</Q> All this, at lea&s;t, is comprehended in the duty of internal &s;obriety.</P>
<P>BUT &s;obriety is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture, in a more large and exten&s;ive meaning. To "think &s;oberly," Rom. xii. 3. is to think di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately and impar|tially. To "be &s;ober," 1 Pet. v. 8. is to have not only our appetites, but our pa&s;&s;ions under &s;ub|jection. To "live &s;oberly," Titus ii. 12. certainly means more than barely re&s;training the &s;en&s;ual ap|petites and inclinations; even the due regulation of all our appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and affections. And I am much inclined to think the word &s;ober, in our text, ought to be taken in this latitude; for, as I &s;aid before, the original word is con&s;trued, to be of a &s;ound mind. And I &s;ee not how barely avoid|ing &s;en&s;uality can intitle a man to this character; for it &s;eems to me, that pride, anger, malice, covet|ou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;content, which vices are di&s;tinct from &s;en&s;uality, are as incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;oundne&s;s of mind as any of the &s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts are. For what is &s;ound|ne&s;s of mind, unle&s;s it be the healthy and regular &s;tate of the &s;oul? Or, in other words, the due re|gularity of all the lower faculties, appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and affections?</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, that makes it appear probable that the word is to be under&s;tood in this large &s;en&s;e, is that this is all the apo&s;tle directed Titus to ex|hort young men unto. Therefore it is more likely that this one word is a word of large and compre|hen&s;ive
<PB N="6" REF="013238_0012_0F90452F804C5EC8">meaning, containing a great number of du|ties in it. Other &s;orts of per&s;ons, Titus is directed to exhort to &s;everal things, in &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions; it &s;eems therefore the more unlikely, that young men were only to be exhorted to avoid &s;en&s;uality. For though this is a &s;in that more "ea&s;ily be&s;ets" them than others, they are al&s;o as liable to commit other &s;ins, as other per&s;ons are.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, I &s;hall treat the &s;ubject in the large&s;t latitude; as if young men were to be ex|horted to get and keep all their appetites and incli|nations, pa&s;&s;ions and affections under the govern|ment of rea&s;on and religion. This is a duty of va&s;t extent, comprehending in it all the internal part of true Chri&s;tianity. For to be &s;ober-minded, with re&s;pect to the &s;en&s;es, includes an aver&s;ion to glut|tony, drunkenne&s;s, and uncleanne&s;s; as well as to extravagance in garb and furniture, and whatever other exce&s;s the &s;en&s;es are apt to lead men into:&mdash; And on the other hand, an habitual di&s;po&s;edne&s;s to u&s;e a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable moderation, in all the&s;e things. They who have attained to this virtue have &s;ubdued and mortified tho&s;e evil propen&s;ities, which are called in &s;cripture, <Q>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h and the lu&s;t of the eye.</Q> And</P>
<P>To be &s;ober-minded, with re&s;pect to the pa&s;&s;ions and affections, is to have our ira&s;cible pa&s;&s;ions ex|cited at nothing, but at what ought to excite them; and to have them rai&s;ed, when occa&s;ion offers, only to &s;uch degrees as rea&s;on and religion allow and ju&s;tify. And al&s;o to have our concupi&s;cible affect|ions placed on none but &s;uitable objects; and on
<PB N="7" REF="013238_0013_0F90453097538EC0">them, only in due and warrantable mea&s;ures. So that this kind of &s;obriety includes in it a &s;upreme love to God and Chri&s;t; the greate&s;t delight in the &s;ervice of God; hating nothing but &s;in; an humble, an aba&s;ed opinion of our&s;elves on account of our &s;ins; grieving more for our &s;ins, than for our &s;uf|ferings; de&s;iring grace and glory more than worldly good things; loving our &s;ouls more than our bo|dies; e&s;teeming and loving our fellow-creatures, in proportion as the moral image of God appears in them, and according as they &s;tand in need of our love; rejoicing in nothing &s;o much as in &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings; hoping for nothing &s;o much as for the favour of God; fearing nothing &s;o much as to offend him; acquie&s;cing in all the allotments of the divine providence; walking by faith, rather than by &s;ight; looking at eternal, with greater emotions of heart than tho&s;e, with which we look at temporal things; and having an anxious concern, de&s;ire and endeavour to avoid all &s;in and tempta|tion, and to walk "in all the ordinances and com|mandments of the Lord blamele&s;s."</P>
<P>THESE are the principal things included in the good regulation of the appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and af|fections. And it is ea&s;y to demon&s;trate that this regulation contains in it the whole vital part of re|ligion. In&s;omuch that he who has this &s;oundne&s;s of mind, this healthy &s;tate of the &s;oul, cannot live in the commi&s;&s;ion of any known &s;in, nor in the omi&s;&s;ion of any known duty. He cannot be covet|ous, unju&s;t, uncharitable, wrathful, cruel, or re|vengeful. He cannot be habitually intemperate in
<PB N="8" REF="013238_0014_0F90453203764AA0">any &s;en&s;itive, animal plea&s;ures. He cannot be profane, un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the divine will, regard|le&s;s of the favour of God, nor carele&s;s and neg|ligent of eternal things: Becau&s;e his heart is right with God; the corrupt bias of his mind is taken away; his &s;oul is renewed after the divine image: &s;o that his "good heart," like "a good tree," cannot but "bring forth good fruit."</P>
<P>IT is this religion of the heart that young men are to be exhorted to, by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; for this it is to be &s;ober-minded. It is the &s;ame, in one word, as to be inwardly and heartily religious; or under the prevailing influence of right and holy principles.&mdash;Let me therefore, as I propo&s;ed, hav|ing &s;ufficiently, though briefly, explained this duty, proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To exhort and per&s;uade the young men of this flock to be &s;ober-minded, or heartily religious.</P>
<P>I COME to you this day, my young friends, on no other errand than that, on which I am &s;ent of God. Con&s;ider me therefore as the me&s;&s;enger of God to you, however unworthy of this high employment. I am going to lay before you &s;everal unan&s;werable arguments and rea&s;ons why you &s;hould now receive religion into your hearts, and become wholly de|voted to the fear and &s;ervice of God. My errand is chiefly to tho&s;e of you, who are not yet &s;ober-minded; but place your happine&s;s in "&s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures." And to tho&s;e, who, though they have had &s;ome &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions, have not yet heartily given them&s;elves to God, but have
<PB N="9" REF="013238_0015_0F9045327B9A7028">prevailing irregularities in their affections. I have the more confidence and hope of &s;ucce&s;s in addre&s;s|ing my&s;elf to you, becau&s;e you are yet young, as it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed your hearts have yet &s;ome natural tenderne&s;s. You have not had &s;o much time as other &s;inners, to &s;in away all your &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience; &s;o that it may be hoped that none of you are hardened in &s;in beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of recovery.</P>
<P>As to &s;ome of you, I would fain hope you have already received this divine gue&s;t, religion, into your hearts. But if you have, I am &s;ure you &s;till need exhortation and in&s;truction. And it may be good for you to hear an exhortation adapted to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who are of a wor&s;e character: for, alas! I know of none of you who appear to have made &s;o great proficiency in the divine life, as you might, and ought to have done. I might well addre&s;s you all, therefore, with the exhortation to be &s;ober-minded; for every one of you need it, more or le&s;s; becau&s;e you all need, either to become &s;o, or to be|come more &s;o. I &s;hall endeavour to per&s;wade you all, by a variety of arguments, and</P>
<P N="1">I. BY this con&s;ideration, that God has &s;ent you into this world, not to take your plea&s;ure, and give a full &s;wing to your appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e inferior principles of your nature; but, by hearty religion and holine&s;s of life, to prepare for happine&s;s in the approaching eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P>CAN you entertain any doubt, whether the pre|&s;ent &s;tate is a &s;tate of probation for another and a better world? Your innate de&s;ire of immortality, together with your experience of the un&s;atisfactory
<PB N="10" REF="013238_0016_0F90453339CF29F0">nature of all pre&s;ent enjoyments, &s;ufficiently evidence, that the pre&s;ent life is only a preface or introduction to another life, which is to be happy and eternal.&mdash; And if you read your bibles, every page almo&s;t will &s;hew you that you are, at pre&s;ent, candidates for glory and immortality. If this is not the ca&s;e, why are the means of grace in&s;tituted? Why are the holy &s;criptures given you? which are profe&s;&s;edly de|&s;igned to &s;hew you the way to eternal happine&s;s, and make you "wi&s;e unto &s;alvation." Why are mini&s;ters ordained and commi&s;&s;ionated to preach faith and repentance, and univer&s;al holine&s;s? Why does the holy &s;pirit of God &s;trive with you? And why does con&s;cience demand it of you, that you &s;eek and &s;erve God continually? You are a&s;&s;ured in &s;cripture, that you &s;hall receive in the eternal world, "the things done here in the body." Surely then, the work God allots for you to do here, is to prepare for an happy futurity. And he has &s;hewed you, in his word, what preparation is nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash; "Without holine&s;s," you are told, "no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." And you are required to <Q>clean&s;e your&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God</Q>&mdash;It is not external holine&s;s only, or principally, but heart-holine&s;s that is here meant; even the &s;ame that is required of you, in the text. External holine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary; but you mu&s;t not be all out&s;ide in reli|gion, and content your&s;elves with making <Q>a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h.</Q> You mu&s;t not be like painted &s;epulchres, which appear beautiful to the eye, while they are within full of bones and rottenne&s;s.

<P>ATTEND therefore, my friends, to your proper work and bu&s;ine&s;s; and let it not be &s;aid of you, that you live in vain, and do not an&s;wer the end of your pre&s;ent exi&s;tence. It is never too early to be|gin upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of life. Let not your oppor|tunity of preparing for eternity, be like <Q>a price in the hand of a fool to get wi&s;dom;</Q> who has "no heart" to improve it. As you &s;ee all other creatures live up to the de&s;ign of their creation, and an&s;wer the end of their being, be a&s;hamed to do otherwi&s;e your&s;elves; for why &s;hould birds and bea&s;ts, why &s;hould &s;tocks and &s;tones <Q>ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t you?</Q>&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="2">II. ANOTHER argument, which I mu&s;t be allowed to in&s;i&s;t much upon is, that now is the be&s;t time for you to endeavour to become truly and heartily religious. The younge&s;t of you are &s;o arrived to maturity of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, that you may well be ex|pected to avoid childi&s;hne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, in your religion. So that it is full time for you to begin in good earne&s;t; and if you neglect it any longer, it will be the wor&s;e for you upon many accounts.&mdash; You have all the real advantages for becoming holy now, that ever you can rea&s;onably expect; and if you let &s;lip the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, it will be attended with &s;o many di&s;advantages, that it will, mo&s;t pro|probably,
<PB N="12" REF="013238_0018_0F904534BAF70438">be the means of your everla&s;ting damnation. Be per&s;waded now therefore, to <Q>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate</Q> of holine&s;s, without any longer delay.&mdash;For</P>
<P N="1">1. YOUR affections, which mu&s;t be engaged in religion, have now &s;ome tenderne&s;s. You have not yet, it is to be hoped, hardened your&s;elves in evil cour&s;es. You can feel &s;ome good motions within you, when you hear or read an awakening and &s;e|rious di&s;cour&s;e. But if you go further on, in the "paths of the de&s;troyer," your hearts will gradually grow harder and harder, your minds blinder and blinder, and your con&s;ciences more &s;eared and &s;tu|pified. For &s;inners do not remain at one certain pitch of wickedne&s;s. The word of God a&s;&s;ures us that "evil men &s;hall wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e;" and this is confirmed by our ob&s;ervation. If you go on to "fill up the mea&s;ure of your iniquities," you will arrive to &s;uch a pitch of wickedne&s;s, and hard-heartedne&s;s, that the terrors of the Lord will no more affright you; the thunders of the law will not terrify you, and the grace of the go&s;pel will not melt and &s;often you. And is it not ea&s;ier, think you, for you to become holy now, than it will be then? At this time of life, you would find it ea&s;y indeed, if you had but a will to endeavour after it, with the &s;ame zeal and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ne&s;s, with which you &s;trive to gain this world's advantages. But <HI>then</HI> it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible. <Q>Can the Ethi|opian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? Then may ye al&s;o do good, who are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</Q> Jer. xiii. 23. At your time of life,
<PB N="13" REF="013238_0019_0F90453870D46978">you can hardly commit any great &s;in, without &s;ome reluctance: but if you are &s;uffered to grow old in iniquity, you will come to commit it with greedine&s;s, and without blu&s;hing or remor&s;e. If you &s;hould live to old age, in your &s;ins, it is much to be doubted whether you would then have any inclinations to repent: But if you &s;hould, you will not find in your hearts to go about it. Men are not wont, at that period of life, to engage in any new under|taking; e&s;pecially in any thing &s;o oppo&s;ite to their own long continued practice. It is to be feared therefore, on this account, that your delaying to be|come holy in youth, will be the means of the irre|trievable perdition of your precious &s;ouls.&mdash; For it is &s;aid, and not without rea&s;on, that by far the greate&s;t part, that ever are &s;avingly converted, are converted before they have got beyond your age.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;criptures give greater encouragement to you, than to older &s;inners, that your endeavours to return to God &s;hall be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash; David &s;aid to his &s;on Solomon, when he was a youth, <Q>if thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake thee.</Q> And the words of wi&s;dom to this purpo&s;e, in the Proverbs, are the&s;e, "they that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me." How precious, O young men, &s;hould the&s;e promi&s;es appear to you? You may depend on it that it is now a finding time. If you now <Q>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate,</Q> with all po&s;&s;ible zeal and ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, you will a&s;&s;uredly enter. And will you not be prevailed with, to enter while you may? The bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s is enough, in all
<PB N="14" REF="013238_0020_0F904539D2977DB0">rea&s;on, to put you upon all po&s;&s;ible endeavours after things which are of eternal con&s;equence to you; how much more the abundant encouragement that is given you, equal, to all valuable intents and purpo&s;es, to a full a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s. Will you not a&s;k, when it is but a&s;k and have? But choo&s;e to di&s;regard and &s;light &s;o important a ble&s;&s;ing till hereafter, when God gives you little encouragement to hope that the mo&s;t &s;trenuous endeavours will prove &s;ucce&s;sful? If this is not folly and madne&s;s, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what is &s;o. As long as life continues, indeed, it is thought there is &s;ome ground of hope; at lea&s;t in common ca&s;es. For the whole of life is a time of probation, with the generality of &s;inners. But how many in&s;tances can you find in &s;cripture, of the efficacy of late endeavours?&mdash;Will you mention the penitent thief, who had the ho|nour to die with Chri&s;t, as an in&s;tance? His re|pentance, though late in his life, does not appear to have been in old age. And you &s;hould con&s;ider that he took, for ought that you know, the fir&s;t opportunity he had of embracing Chri&s;t and his re|ligion; and that he gave him&s;elf to Chri&s;t on a cro&s;s, whereas you reject him on his throne. So, there were probably &s;ome aged &s;inners among the multitudes, converted by the fir&s;t preaching of the Apo&s;tles; but then you &s;hould remember, that they had not become &s;o, under the light of the go&s;pel.&mdash; How &s;lender grounds of dependance then have you, if you neglect your &s;ouls concerns till old age, and then begin to &s;eek, that ever you &s;hall find mercy? Seize therefore, I pray you, if you love your &s;ouls,
<PB N="15" REF="013238_0021_0F90453B1179CCF8">the happy moments of your youth: employ and u&s;e them to the important purpo&s;es of religion; le&s;t you hereafter go down to your graves, and to hell, &s;eeking and crying out in vain, for that mercy and grace, which you now di&s;regard, or put away from you. <Q>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near,</Q> I&s;ai. lv. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. As you have no a&s;&s;urance given you that late &s;eekers &s;hall find grace, &s;o the rea&s;on of the thing renders it doubtful; and therefore it is dreadfully hazardous for you to po&s;tpone your &s;eeking to a late &s;ea&s;on. As grace is very freely offered, in God's word, to all who will accept of it, it &s;eems to follow as a ju&s;t inference, that there is &s;ome time of life, in which men, if they are not &s;lack in their endeavours, may find grace. Youth is pointed out to be &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on; is it not therefore very doubtful, whether age is a &s;ea&s;on to become holy? Be&s;ides, God, you know, de&s;erves to be &s;erved with your be&s;t; that is, with the flower and bloom of life. Your be&s;t vigour and activity are mo&s;t ju&s;tly his due.&mdash; Dare you then entertain one thought of putting him off with the dregs of life, after you &s;hall have &s;pent all the be&s;t of your days in vanity and &s;in? Can you flatter your&s;elves that he will &s;tand ready to accept &s;o mi&s;erable and worthle&s;s a &s;acrifice at your hands? If you will &s;erve &s;in and &s;atan, 'till you can &s;erve them vigorou&s;ly no longer, what virtue will it be in you afterwards, to con&s;ent to &s;erve God? This may well be thought to be offering a gro&s;s affront to your Creator, who commands you to "remember" him "in the days of your youth."&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="013238_0022_0F90453B9866D768">Do you think he will take up with the world's leavings, and with the Devil's leavings? If you depend upon this, you are madly pre&s;umptuous.&mdash; Be per&s;uaded then to mind religion now, before it is too late; before you &s;hall have &s;quandered away that time and &s;trength, which God has given you for no other end, than to be employed in his &s;ervice; and before you &s;hall have provoked him to <Q>&s;wear in his wrath, that you &s;hall not enter into his re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. THE pre&s;ent time is be&s;t, as it is the only time you are &s;ure of. Time pre&s;ent you may call your own; but not &s;o that which is future. A certain opportunity is better than a precarious one, in which to tran&s;act any propo&s;ed bu&s;ine&s;s of indi&s;|pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity. Let this then be another weighty motive with you, to be &s;peedy in admitting religion into your hearts. That which you know you mu&s;t do, you had better do at pre&s;ent, while you may, than leave to the mercy of future contingences. I &s;uppo&s;e you have, at lea&s;t re&s;olved, or promi&s;ed your&s;elves that you will become truly holy and heavenly, before you leave the world. You could not have kept your con&s;ciences &s;o ea&s;y as you have kept them, without making &s;ome &s;uch re&s;olves and promi&s;es, from time to time. But are you not aware of the dreadful fallacy of this? Will you not &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, that time and opportunity may fail you? And that if it &s;hould &s;o happen, you are as much lo&s;t and undone forever, as if you had never had one &s;erious thought of ever returning to God.</P>
<P>O that I could once convince you how impru|dent, how pre&s;umptuous and dangerous it is, to
<PB N="17" REF="013238_0023_0F90453C398EECA0">procra&s;tinate the va&s;t work of preparing for eter|nity! Millions of &s;inners have been da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t this rock; and yet, oh the &s;tupidity! it makes but little impre&s;&s;ion on the re&s;t. Thou&s;ands are going to hell every day, who promi&s;ed them|&s;elves, as you do, that they would repent and live to God, &s;ome time hence.

They have rea&s;on enough, if they would but u&s;e rea&s;on, to &s;hew them the madne&s;s and folly of delaying the great, and infinitely important work of religion.&mdash; But &s;inners wilfully &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the cleare&s;t light; they will not be &s;o wi&s;e as to <Q>number their days,</Q> and "con&s;ider their latter end."</P>
<P>YOU can &s;ee, my dear friends, the danger and folly of procra&s;tination in others. Alas! why can you not be &s;en&s;ible of it in your&s;elves? If you hap|pen to &s;ee a fellow-creature labouring under a mor|tal di&s;temper, or even in the late&s;t decay of age, thoughtle&s;s of eternity and profane, doubtle&s;s it &s;hocks you.

<P>THE mo&s;t florid youth, the highe&s;t health and vigour, you may ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, are no &s;e|curity again&s;t the &s;troke of death.

How often are they flattered with the hopes of recovery, by their phy&s;icians and friends, in the beginning of their di&s;ea&s;e, that their &s;pirits may not &s;ink; 'till at once, all comes to be too late, and nothing can be done for &s;oul or body, to keep the one from the grave,

Upon the whole, the hazard of your tru&s;t|ing to a death-bed preparation is &s;o great, that it is next to taking up a re&s;olution, that you will never take any care of your &s;oul at all.

<P>THUS I have &s;hewed you, O young men, two of the many powerful motives there are, to per|&s;wade you to become &s;ober-minded, or heartily re|ligious, while you remain young men.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="013238_0030_0F90454186FF4668">
THESE arguments, if they had their due weight with you, would be &s;ufficient to over balance all your pre&s;ent aver&s;ion to holine&s;s.&mdash;But I &s;hall fur|ther pur&s;ue my pre&s;ent de&s;ign of exhorting you to internal &s;obriety, as &s;oon as it &s;hall plea&s;e God to give me another opportunity.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>TITUS 11.6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Young men likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MINISTERS are concerned to comply with this exhortation: for in it Titus, and through him all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are directed to exhort young men to be &s;ober-minded, or heartily religious. As this flock contains many young men, I hope I &s;hall not be thought tedious, if in a long addre&s;s to them, I urge them by a variety of motives, rational and &s;criptural, to do the work and bu&s;ine&s;s they are &s;ent into the world to do, while the be&s;t, and I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the only &s;ea&s;on for their doing it con|tinues.</P>
<P>IN the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, after I had explain|ed the nature of the duty to which young men are to be exhorted, I endeavoured to per&s;uade them to get and cultivate internal &s;obriety, by &s;hewing them,</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT God &s;ent them into the world, that by hearty religion and holine&s;s of life, they &s;hould prepare for happine&s;s in the approaching eternal &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="013238_0033_0F904543E3149B28">
II. THAT now is the be&s;t time, upon many ac|counts, to &s;et them&s;elves about the great work of religion.</P>
<P>I AM now to go on farther with the &s;ame gene|ral exhortation, by urging &s;everal other motives upon them; that if po&s;&s;ible, they may feel the weight of &s;ome or other of them; or at lea&s;t, that by the force of them all in conjunction, with the concurrence of the &s;pirit of grace, they may be made willing to part with all their lu&s;ts, and be|come &s;ober-minded. To proceed then,</P>
<P N="3">III. CONSIDER farther, my beloved young friends, that your becoming religious in your youth will render you greatly u&s;eful in the world, and make you ble&s;&s;ings to mankind.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t that can be &s;aid of an irreligious and wicked life is, that it is u&s;ele&s;s, in compari&s;on with an holy and virtuous one. All the wicked are ei|ther nui&s;ances and pe&s;ts in &s;ociety, or el&s;e they &s;tand almo&s;t like ciphers, and an&s;wer few valuable purpo&s;es; unle&s;s it be accidentally and unde&s;igned|ly. This may well be expected to be the ca&s;e, when we con&s;ider that worldly &s;elf-love is their predominant principle. I will not &s;uppo&s;e you at pre&s;ent to be &s;o far gone in wickedne&s;s as to be &s;courges to mankind; though if you will not be per&s;uaded to be religious, you may &s;oon become &s;o: for the way of &s;in is down-hill. But you are to be con&s;idered as almo&s;t void of u&s;efulne&s;s, in com|pari&s;on with what you might be, and as an&s;wering not many valuable purpo&s;es, by your exi&s;tence. Con&s;ider this, I be&s;eech you, that you may awak|en
<PB N="29" REF="013238_0034_0F90454485E041D8">an holy ambition in your&s;elves, and &s;o engage in the &s;ervice of God, that you may become great ble&s;&s;ings to your fellow-men. Even the younge&s;t of you are now arrived to tho&s;e years, in which you might be very u&s;eful, if God's grace had ad|mittance into your hearts. And &s;ince God has put it in your power to be rich ble&s;&s;ings to man|kind, this is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why you &s;hould be &s;o. If you have any philanthropy, any true benevo|lence in you, you will think it is time to exert your&s;elves, according to the dictates of religion, in doing good to all around you. To what purpo&s;e are all the noble powers and faculties of body and mind, with which God has endowed you? unle&s;s you u&s;e them as he directs you. Why has he &s;uffered you to e&s;cape all tho&s;e fatal accidents, to which childhood and early youth are obnoxious, and help|ed you thus to ripen into manhood? It is not that you &s;hould live wholly unto your&s;elves; but partly that you &s;hould an&s;wer valuable purpo&s;es to the community, with which you are connected. God has a&s;&s;igned each one of you your &s;tation; and no|thing like Chri&s;tian &s;obriety will enable you to act your parts well.</P>
<P>THE religious and virtuous man is a benefit to all around him, by his governing his own appetites, pa&s;&s;ions and affections according to the will of God, and the dictates of con&s;cience. For the&s;e lower principles are not &s;uffered to &s;tand in the way of his doing tho&s;e duties to his fellow-creatures, which God requires him to do. He is charitable to the indigent and mi&s;erable; ju&s;t and righteous
<PB N="30" REF="013238_0035_0F904548E0339B48">towards all men; unkind and injurious to none; extending his benevolence to his enemies, and the whole human race. He allures his ob&s;ervers to virtue and piety, by his good example. He ob|tains ble&s;&s;ings on the community by his prayers. His righteou&s;ne&s;s prevents impending judgments falling upon a &s;inful people. So that he is, on &s;e|veral accounts, an important advantage to the publick.</P>
<P>HAVE you no ambition, my young friends, thus to become publick benefactors? It is glorious to love your country. It is fa&s;hionable to profe&s;s this love. It is nece&s;&s;ary that you abound in it, in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and alarming &s;tate of our pub|lick affairs. You can no way &s;o much befriend your country, I am &s;ure, as by your being truly religious. It is "righteou&s;ne&s;s that exalteth a nation." Your goodne&s;s may extend to more coun|tries than that of your nativity. You may thus be|come like gods on earth, without any expen&s;e, or trouble, only by being and doing what is be&s;t for your&s;elves. You cannot rea&s;onably refu&s;e, or withhold &s;o cheap a &s;acrifice to the publick welfare.</P>
<P>This leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">IV. A religious life is more plea&s;ant and happy, than a life of &s;in and vanity: and this I would urge upon young men as a motive to per&s;uade them to be &s;ober-minded.</P>
<P>If I could convince you, my young friends, of the plea&s;antne&s;s of religion, I am per&s;uaded you would &s;oon embrace it; for you are no way defi|cient in loving plea&s;ure. You have a quick ta&s;te
<PB N="31" REF="013238_0036_0F90454A4AF1E528">for plea&s;ure; and you would be glad to feel hap|py, every remaining day of your lives. Let me then put you into the mo&s;t likely way to obtain the thing you de&s;ire. That I may do this, you mu&s;t permit me to convince you of the truth of the roy|al preacher's ob&s;ervation, that religious <Q>wi&s;dom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth dark|ne&s;s;</Q> and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is &s;o much greater a &s;ource of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>YOU cannot be happy, &s;o long as con&s;cience is vexing, galling and &s;tinging you. Con&s;cious guilt is enough to keep you continually unea&s;y; and it really robs of their repo&s;e all who are going on in the ways of wickedne&s;s. But an approving con&s;cience is a con&s;tant &s;pring of peace. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <Q>great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing &s;hall offend them.</Q> Yea, it is a foundation of continual rejoicing. <Q>Our rejoicing is this,</Q> &s;ays the apo&s;tle Paul, <Q>the te&s;timony of our con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver|&s;ation in the world.</Q></P>
<P>THE wicked and licentious endeavour to put on the appearance of happine&s;s; and &s;ome of them are often boa&s;ting that they enjoy them&s;elves better than the &s;ober and preci&s;e. But this is always fal&s;e, and often feigned. They are certainly unea&s;y in their own company, though they would have it thought they are men of plea&s;ure. Therefore it is that they cannot abide &s;olitude, nor be ea&s;y with|out frequent diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements. They
<PB N="32" REF="013238_0037_0F90454B95DC3100">find they mu&s;t do &s;omething to drown thought, and &s;ilence the clamours of con&s;cience; therefore they ru&s;h into &s;cenes of gaiety, or into revelling and de|bauchery.&mdash;But the &s;ober-minded can be happy, without the help of &s;uch violent amu&s;ements. They cannot only bear to conver&s;e with them&s;elves; but they can enjoy great plea&s;ure in &s;olitary meditations, and in &s;elf-recollection and reflection. While the minds of the <Q>wicked are like the troubled &s;ea, who&s;e waves ca&s;t up mire and dirt;</Q> the &s;ouls of the righteous are like pure and healing foun|tains, or rivers of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WICKED men, I confe&s;s, have joys: but they are impure, &s;udden, too violent to la&s;t, and leave &s;tings behind them. Even <Q>in the mid&s;t of laughter, their hearts are often &s;ad.</Q> But the godly and virtuous enjoy plea&s;ures &s;incere and refined: &s;uited to the nature of the &s;oul. They are of an even tenour, and &s;uch as can be reflected on with plea|&s;ure. What is the plea&s;ure of a riot or debauch, to compare with the plea&s;ure of communion with God, or with the plea&s;ure of re&s;embling him in temper and conduct? The former is ba&s;er than the happine&s;s of a &s;wine; the latter re&s;embles that of the ble&s;&s;ed angels. If the ble&s;&s;ed are happier than the damned, it follows that the virtuous are more happy than the vicious, in this life; for the happi|ne&s;s of heaven is the natural fruit of holine&s;s, and the torments of hell are created by &s;in.</P>
<P>MEN cannot but think of God &s;ome times; for all things around us declare his being, perfections and providence. But the wicked cannot &s;eriou&s;ly
<PB N="33" REF="013238_0038_0F90454C18200E50">think of God, without horror and dread; whereas the righteous have great plea&s;ure in meditating on his nature, attributes and works. The former cannot be quiet within, until they bani&s;h him out of their minds; the latter have ineffable plea&s;ure in retaining the idea of him. The former can take no plea&s;ure in addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to him; the latter have heavenly joys, in their hours of com|munion with him.</P>
<P>ETERNITY will &s;ome times force it&s;elf into the minds of &s;inners, in &s;pite of all their endeavours to prevent it; and as often as it does &s;o, it fills them with a panick; as well it may. But the godly look forward to that &s;tate with plea&s;ure; for it is there that they place their happine&s;s. It is there that they expect to enjoy God fully, after all their tem|poral joys and &s;orrows are ended. The former, when they look forward to that &s;tate, &s;ee nought but trouble and darkne&s;s; an horrible and amazing pro&s;pect, which robs them of their pre&s;ent repo&s;e and plea&s;ure: The latter &s;olace their minds with an anticipation and fore-ta&s;te of tho&s;e joys, which are prepared for them in the upper world. And this &s;ooths all their cares, abates their griefs, and enables them patiently, and therefore more ea&s;ily than others, to bear the unavoidable evils of life.</P>
<P>THE righteous are more happy than the wicked in their temporal enjoyments. They are more con|tented with that portion of worldly good things, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and hereby they become more happy; for our pre&s;ent happine&s;s does not bear proportion to the degrees of our wealth, but to the
<PB N="34" REF="013238_0039_0F90454CC963E670">degrees of our contentment. So that <Q>the little that a righteous man hath is better,</Q> more con|ducive to happine&s;s, <Q>than the trea&s;ures of many wicked.</Q></P>
<P>ALSO, whatever good things they enjoy, it is a &s;atisfaction to them that they have rea&s;on to believe God &s;ends them in love, and that the divine ble&s;&s;ing attends them. But the wicked, amid&s;t all their worldly good things, have rea&s;on to apprehend that the cur&s;e of God attends them; that they are like bullocks fatting for the &s;laughter, and that their "pro&s;perity" will contribute to "de&s;troy them" eternally. The righteous have the promi&s;e of tem|poral pro&s;perity, &s;o far as &s;hall be for the glory of God, and their own everla&s;ting good; and more than this they cannot, in rea&s;on, de&s;ire. <Q>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,</Q> &s;ays David, <Q>and he &s;hall exalt thee to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off thou &s;halt &s;ee it.</Q> And the apo&s;tle Paul a&s;&s;ures us, that <Q>godline&s;s is pro|fitable unto all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is.</Q>&mdash;But the ungodly have no &s;uch promi&s;es to rely upon.</P>
<P>So that you may &s;ee, religion is every way pro|ductive of pre&s;ent happine&s;s. As you love happi|ne&s;s then, my young friends, be per&s;uaded to admit religion into your hearts and live by its dictates.</P>
<P>YOU have &s;uffered your&s;elves to be prejudiced again&s;t a religious life, by &s;ugge&s;tions that it will be contrary to your pre&s;ent ea&s;e and happine&s;s.&mdash; You have abu&s;ed your&s;elves with &s;uch an opinion, which is as fal&s;e as any of Satan's &s;ugge&s;tions can
<PB N="35" REF="013238_0040_0F90454D99F11918">be.&mdash;Religion does not require you to part with any manly and rational plea&s;ures and enjoyments. It only requires you to refrain from tho&s;e indul|gences and exce&s;&s;es, which are contrary, and a &s;candal to your rational nature; and in return gives you the noble&s;t intellectual plea&s;ures: and the&s;e latter are as much above the former, as heaven is above the earth. If you mu&s;t give up the plea|&s;ure you enjoy in the &s;ociety of your wicked com|panions, you will obtain the &s;ociety of the wi&s;e and good, which is more than a balance. If you deny your&s;elves the gains of wickedne&s;s, you will find "godline&s;s is gain," as the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures you, and an incomparably more beneficial kind of gain.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible there is no making you realize, that the plea&s;ures of religion exceed tho&s;e of &s;in, 'till you learn it from your own experience. But let me prevail with you to pay &s;ome regard to the authority of God, who declares this to you. And I be&s;eech you, give &s;ome credit to that which expe|rienced Chri&s;tians tell you they have found, by long trial. Be &s;o far influenced by the&s;e things, at lea&s;t, as to make the experiment whether it is not as I tell you. If you were once to ta&s;te the &s;weets of holine&s;s, I am per&s;uaded nothing could induce you afterwards, to abandon them for the plea&s;ures of &s;in. For you would find that <Q>in keeping the com|mandments of God there is a great reward;</Q> as well as an infinite reward in rever&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS life is not &s;o happy, at be&s;t, that you need to deny your&s;elves the highe&s;t plea&s;ures that are to be enjoyed in it; as indeed you will, if you neglect
<PB N="36" REF="013238_0041_0F90454E51EC0340">the plea&s;ures of religion. If you de&s;ire to enjoy all the plea&s;ures that is po&s;&s;ible here, you mu&s;t become holy in early life. You have lo&s;t &s;ome of your time already, in &s;in and vanity. Many of you have gone &s;o far in the ways of &s;in, that you cannot but have ob&s;erved its plea&s;ures are un&s;atisfactory and vexatious. Squander away no more of your pre|cious moments, I be&s;eech you, <Q>le&s;t you mourn at the la&s;t;</Q> for the time is coming, when you will think all the time lo&s;t, and wor&s;e than lo&s;t, which you have not &s;pent in the &s;ervice of God. You are yet &s;o young that you have a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity for enjoying much of the plea&s;ure of religion: for accord|ing to the cour&s;e of nature, you have more time be|fore you to exerci&s;e your&s;elves in holine&s;s, than many others. And be&s;ides, your affections have not yet lo&s;t their &s;pring; &s;o that you are capable of the mo&s;t lively and &s;en&s;ible joys of religion. The&s;e are advantages for happine&s;s, that are peculiar to per|&s;ons of your age: but they will abate and dimini&s;h, as you advance in years. Seize this golden &s;ea&s;on therefore; and &s;o &s;ecure the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t dur|able plea&s;ures you are capable of, on this &s;ide heaven.</P>
<P>O THAT you could have &s;uch a view of the&s;e things, as they have, who begin to be religious in the afternoon of life! Could you but know the re|gret they feel, on account of their having mi&s;&s;ed the delights of religion in their youth, you would now &s;pring forward without delay, and &s;erve God with all your might. You would give your lu&s;ts and corruptions quarter, not a moment longer.&mdash; Believe me, my friends, you will, one time or other,
<PB N="37" REF="013238_0042_0F90454F0FFBFEC8">lament it bitterly, if you devote not your early days to God. There is a dreadful probability that you will have to lament it forever, when it is too late to do you any good.&mdash;Not only will religion promote your pre&s;ent happine&s;s, but,</P>
<P N="5">V. NOTHING el&s;e can be &s;o much for your ho|nour and reputation in the world, as to be &s;ober|minded, or heartily religious in your youth.</P>
<P>YOU are doubtle&s;s de&s;irous of honour, and would be glad to be much re&s;pected, and highly prai&s;ed by your fellow-creatures. For the love of fame is truly &s;aid to be an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion. Youth is the time of life when ambition commonly ri&s;es highe&s;t; and it is a laudable ambition, to de&s;ire to be in ho|nour and repute for piety and virtue. You may be allowed to indulge this de&s;ire, to a certain de|gree; only you mu&s;t take care that you love not "the prai&s;e of men, &s;o much as the prai&s;e of God;" and that, whenever they come into competition, you are governed by the latter.</P>
<P>SUFFER me to take hold of your ambition, as a handle to lead you into the paths of holine&s;s. Con|&s;ider how much eminently holy men are reverenced and celebrated, by all who have any ta&s;te for moral beauty. Ob&s;erve how re&s;pectfully they are &s;poken of, in almo&s;t every company. See the veneration &s;hewed them, where they are pre&s;ent. Hear the encomiums that are pa&s;&s;ed upon them, in their ab|&s;ence. Then a&s;k your&s;elves if you would not gladly &s;hare in their honours.</P>
<P>IT is true, that &s;ome few of the mo&s;t profane and abandoned love to &s;peak again&s;t holy men, and
<PB N="38" REF="013238_0043_0F90454FB708C690">endeavour to de&s;pi&s;e them in their hearts. But there are very few, even of the wicked, who do not venerate them in their minds, and even wi&s;h, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, to be like them. But all who&s;e prai&s;e is any honour, are unanimous in prai&s;ing all who appear to be truly religious and virtuous. And they will prai&s;e them the more in proportion as they approach nearer to perfection, in all the amia|ble graces of Chri&s;tianity. If you are truly reli|gious, all the good will e&s;teem and &s;peak highly of you; yea, and the greater part of the wicked will do the &s;ame. For but few are &s;o abandoned as not to perceive and approve what is good.&mdash;And even tho&s;e of the wicked who hate you for your good|ne&s;s, will hardly dare to do otherwi&s;e than &s;peak well of you; becau&s;e it will be unpopular, and apt to hurt their own credit.</P>
<P>THE eminently holy and virtuous, of every age and &s;tanding in life, are honourable: but eminent|ly pious and &s;ober youths commonly receive dou|ble honour. It is &s;o rare a thing to &s;ee young men abound with grace, that tho&s;e who evidently do &s;o are &s;ingularly celebrated. Mo&s;t per&s;ons are often &s;peaking in their prai&s;es and mentioning their at|tainments with admiration. They &s;eldom fail to become famous, not only in their own times, but in &s;ucceeding ages. Yea, &s;ome &s;uch obtain an in|delible and everla&s;ting reputation. Tho&s;e holy young men, Samuel and Jo&s;iah, Shadrach, Me|&s;hech and Abed-nego, Daniel and Timothy have their extraordinary piety recorded in deathle&s;s re|gi&s;ters; and their &s;ame &s;hall be handed down,
<PB N="39" REF="013238_0044_0F904550CF980120">through all the remaining generations of the world. Will not a con&s;ideration of the fame of the&s;e pious youths in&s;pire you with an ardent zeal to follow their bright examples? Imitate their virtues, and you may obtain &s;imilar honours. Many will <Q>ri&s;e up and call you ble&s;&s;ed,</Q> while you live, and your names &s;hall be had <Q>in everla&s;ting remem|brance.</Q></P>
<P N="6">VI. IF you love to excel and &s;hine in any bu&s;ine&s;s that you undertake, enter upon a religious cour&s;e now, that &s;o in that mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s, you may make great proficiency.</P>
<P>YOU will never, it is probable, arrive to great attainments in religion, unle&s;s you begin betimes. Can you be willing to grovel as long as you live, and never attain to any extraordinary degrees of holine&s;s? It is likely you intend to get, &s;ome time or other, religion enough to fit you for heaven.&mdash; But is it not de&s;irable to exceed the lower forms of Chri&s;tians? Is it not worthy your ambition to aim at the highe&s;t improvements in the divine life? I would fain &s;uppo&s;e that you think &s;o. It is high time, therefore, for you to begin your journey heaven-wards. For the way to do extra|ordinary &s;ervice for God, is not to &s;pend the fir&s;t, and be&s;t of your time in idlene&s;s. If you would be before others, you mu&s;t &s;tart earlier than others; becau&s;e religion is a progre&s;&s;ive work. I never knew any very improved Chri&s;tians, who were not religious from their youth. But if you begin in youth, you will have all po&s;&s;ible advantage for do|ing more than others. Thus you may come to be
<PB N="40" REF="013238_0045_0F9045522CB39698">grown men and &s;trong, while many of your &s;eniors are but babes in Chri&s;t. You may arrive to the full a&s;&s;urance of faith, while they are &s;truggling in the narrows of regeneration. You may come to be filled with <Q>joy and peace in believing, while they remain in bondage, through fear of death.</Q> If you did but realize one half of the advantages of high attainments in grace, you would devote your early days to God, le&s;t you &s;hould never arrive thereunto.</P>
<P N="7">VII. CONSIDER whether you are not bound by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able ties of grati|tude to God to devote your youthful days to him.</P>
<P>GOD is your creator. His almighty fiat bro't you out of nothing into being, and furni&s;hed you with all your powers of action, both corporal and mental. And who &s;hould you &s;erve, but him who made you? You owe him all that you are and have; and you cannot be too early in giving him his own, e&s;pecially as he demands it of you. If you do not &s;peedily devote all your powers to his &s;ervice, where is your gratitude. Is it not a &s;hameful thing to deny him any of your time? Refu&s;e him not then your youth, in which you can &s;erve him be&s;t.</P>
<P>HE has al&s;o fed and cloathed you, <Q>nouri&s;hed and brought you up as children.</Q> Yea, he has been doing this, while you have been forgetting and for&s;aking him; or el&s;e affronting and provok|ing him, with horrid rebellion again&s;t his &s;acred authority. In&s;tead of de&s;troying you, according to your de&s;erts, he has been loading you <Q>with his benefits.</Q> Will you then per&s;i&s;t any longer in
<PB N="41" REF="013238_0046_0F9045530B2754D8">making &s;o vile a return for his goodne&s;s, as to de|ny him your &s;ervice? He ob&s;erves your conduct; he takes notice how you requite him, and highly re&s;ents your ingratitude. He calls heaven and earth to witne&s;s to the ingratitude of &s;uch as you have hitherto been. "Hear, O heavens," &s;aith he, <Q>and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath &s;poken: I have nouri&s;hed and brought up chil|dren, but they have rebelled again&s;t me.</Q></P>
<P>WHERE then can words be found to expre&s;s your ingratitude, if you continue in &s;in, when you know that Chri&s;t died an ignominious and mo&s;t painful death, to <Q>redeem you from all iniquity, and pu|rify you unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works?</Q> Titus ii. 14. Has he died on the cro&s;s to obtain pardon for all true penitents, and will you not repent? Has he &s;uffered the cur&s;e, that he might &s;end you the &s;anctifying Spirit, and will you not improve his a&s;&s;i&s;tance? If this is your ca&s;e, no other kind of ingratitude is fit to be com|pared with your's.</P>
<P>YOUR glorious Prince has died in your &s;tead; becau&s;e his infinite compa&s;&s;ion towards you would not permit him to &s;ee you &s;uffer the de&s;truction to which you were obnoxious. And will not this pre|vail with you, to make you throw down the arms you have taken up again&s;t him? If not, your guilt will ri&s;e beyond all parallel. You will be ranked with tho&s;e, who are &s;aid to <Q>crucify the Son of God afre&s;h:&mdash;no more &s;acrifice</Q> will be admitted for your unmea&s;urably aggravated &s;in; <Q>but there remaineth a certain fearful looking for
<PB N="42" REF="013238_0047_0F9044800C451530">of judgment and fiery indignation, which &s;hall devour</Q> you. You mu&s;t expect a far <Q>&s;orer puni&s;hment,</Q> than the de&s;pi&s;ers of the law of Mo&s;es underwent, who were put to death <Q>without mercy,</Q> without redemption or reprieve.</P>
<P>THE more means God has u&s;ed, and the greater expen&s;e he has been at to bring you to him&s;elf, the more atrocious is the guilt of your unthankfulne&s;s. If you had never heard of Chri&s;t, the ingratitude of your &s;ins would have been really inexcu&s;able; for the heathen nations are truly &s;aid to be <Q>with|out excu&s;e,</Q> Rom. i. 20. But how much more &s;o are you, who have the free offer of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, and live under the cleare&s;t light of the go&s;|pel? You have, in this land, all po&s;&s;ible advan|tages of grace. You enjoy a degree of religious liberty, which is denied to far the greater part of Chri&s;tendom. You are generally taught, in your childhood, the principles of religion; and your mini&s;ters are continually wooing and be&s;eeching you to "be reconciled to God." Let not all the la|bour that is laid out on you be lo&s;t; for if you will not after all be per&s;uaded, you mu&s;t expect a mo&s;t aggravated damnation. For Chri&s;t has &s;aid, <Q>that &s;ervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes.</Q> The people of Sodom and Gomorrah, though their crimes were &s;uch as you abhor, will have a lighter doom than you in the day of judgment, unle&s;s you re|pent. O let the&s;e alarming con&s;iderations prevail with you to make a &s;peedy &s;urrender of your&s;elves to God.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="43" REF="013238_0048_0F9044811F508A60">
VIII. You mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, that early piety is the means of advancing the glory of God mo&s;t effectually; therefore that you &s;hould now become &s;ober-minded.</P>
<P>IT was for the manife&s;tation of his glory that you, and all other creatures and things were cre|ated. Surely you &s;hould make that a de&s;ign of your actions, which was God's de&s;ign in giving you power to act. The promoting his glory, there|fore, &s;hould be an abiding and powerful motive to duty with you. If, by early religion, you can be&s;t promote this de&s;ign; let the de&s;ire of this engage you to be religious, while your youth continues. And that this is really true, I hope to convince you.</P>
<P>"HEREIN is my Father glorified," &s;ays Chri&s;t, "that ye bear much fruit." But you cannot ex|pect to bear much, if you remain barren trees in God's vineyard, until you begin to wither away. Let the fruits of internal &s;obriety and holine&s;s, then, be found upon you in youth, as ever you hope to be <Q>filled with the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s and ho|line&s;s, which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the glory and prai&s;e of God.</Q></P>
<P>BY early piety you will not only glorify God in your own per&s;ons, but be the means of its being done by others. "Your light" will <Q>&s;o &s;hine be|fore men, that they may &s;ee your good works;</Q> and this will excite them to endeavour to follow your bright example, and thereby <Q>glorify your Father which is in heaven.</Q></P>
<P>YOUR truly religious conduct will be &s;uch a con|tinual reproof of the carele&s;s and irreligious lives of
<PB N="44" REF="013238_0049_0F904481960DC468">your &s;eniors, that it will be one of the mo&s;t effectual means to awaken their con&s;ciences, and bring them into the way of holine&s;s. It is highly probable they will be hereby led to reflect, and con&s;ider how &s;hameful it is, that they are &s;o backward in their preparation for eternity, when they &s;ee young per|&s;ons &s;o forward; and that the nece&s;&s;ity is great that they begin the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life, without any longer delay, as they are probably &s;o much nearer than you to the end of their probation &s;tate.&mdash;But you will not be apt to leave them wholly to their own reflections. You will mode&s;tly remind them, as you have opportunity, of the evil of &s;in, and of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s and danger of neglecting their mo&s;t important concerns, and of living as "with|out God in the world." And the idea of your youth, if you reprove and exhort wi&s;ely, will give a peculiar force to &s;uch applications.</P>
<P>ALSO, you will be likely to become the in&s;tru|ments of reclaiming your equals to religion and virtue Your good examples will have an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;table influence upon them; and you can hardly fail of doing them much good. You will do much to &s;hame them out of their vices, and to allure them into the way, in which they &s;hould walk. For young per&s;ons are much influenced by examples, and &s;eldom fail to become like their companions. Therefore if you de&s;ire that God &s;hould be glorified in the conver&s;ion of your acquaintances, begin to &s;erve the Lord betimes. If the young men who are here pre&s;ent would become as exemplarily religious as they ought, I &s;hould expect it would be the
<PB N="45" REF="013238_0050_0F904485C70AA490">means of a general revival of religion among us.&mdash; You have it in your power to do much in this way for the honour of God. Do it then, becau&s;e you can do it. This is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on; for you are obliged to do all you can for the honour of him, who is the owner of your bodies and &s;pirits, and the giver of all your time and talents.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, they who have the honour of God and the welfare of religion at heart, will be &s;o re|joiced to ob&s;erve your early piety, that they will not cea&s;e to give thanks, to prai&s;e and glorify the name of God, for his grace appearing in you. As the churches of Judea "glorified God in" the apo&s;tle Paul, when they heard of his conver&s;ion to Chri&s;ti|anity; &s;o will Chri&s;tians glorify God in you, or on your account, when they perceive your conver&s;ion to holine&s;s.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANS will ble&s;s God, not only for what you are, but for the pro&s;pect he gives them in you, of much good to the ri&s;ing generation. Our at|tention is turned upon you, my young friends; for we cannot but look upon you, as upon per&s;ons that are to be of great importance in years to come, when our own day is over. It lies much with you, whether the cau&s;e of religion is to revive and flouri&s;h, or farther to &s;ink and decay. The younge&s;t of you, if God &s;pares your lives, are &s;oon to be heads and governors of families. And how thankful &s;hall we be, if we can &s;ee rea&s;on to believe that you and your hou&s;es "will &s;erve the Lord?"&mdash;But on the other hand, it will depre&s;s our &s;pirits to &s;ee you ri&s;ing up to be the chiefs and leaders of a carele&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="013238_0051_0F9044870C0B2CF8">and ungodly generation.&mdash;How do you think your aged Chri&s;tian friends can die in peace, &s;o long as they have too much rea&s;on to think their places will be &s;upplied with young men who <Q>ca&s;t off the fear of God?</Q> Be religious therefore in mercy to them, le&s;t you <Q>bring down their grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave.</Q> You cannot think how tho&s;e of you who are mo&s;t evidently ungodly, wring the hearts of your good parents, and other pious Chri&s;tians. As you know not what high plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction you would give them, by an early walking in the ways of God: &s;o you can|not conceive how you pain them by your contrary practices.</P>
<P N="9">IX. As you would lay a foundation for an happy clo&s;e of life, be per&s;uaded to mind your main con|cern in your early days.</P>
<P>THAT is a true &s;aying, <Q>a well-&s;pent life makes a plea&s;ant old age.</Q> Be real Chri&s;tians from this time forwards; and if you &s;hould live to the other|wi&s;e cheerle&s;s days of age, you will then have the be&s;t comfort, when other comforts lo&s;e their reli&s;h; the delights of virtue and communion with God, exerci&s;es of the &s;oul a-kin to heavenly bli&s;s, and a comfortable retro&s;pect on a life well-&s;pent. The&s;e will be mo&s;t important &s;upports to your &s;pirits, which you cannot well be without, when your "fle&s;h and heart" is failing, and you feel your&s;elves tottering on the brink of a fathomle&s;s eternity.&mdash; You canot conceive what a relief it will be to you, if you are able then, like Hezekiah, to look up to God &s;aying, <Q>remember now, O Lord, I be&s;eech
<PB N="47" REF="013238_0052_0F9044878D651B90">thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P>IN your &s;erious moments, you are doubtle&s;s ready to pray like Balaam, <Q>let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his.</Q> Let me remind you, that in order to obtain this favour of God, you mu&s;t live a life of evangelical holine&s;s. The oracles of God point out no other way. Live like the righteous, and then you may hope, thro' the mercy of God in Chri&s;t, that you &s;hall die like them. &mdash;You may die &s;afely indeed, if you &s;hould enter late upon an holy life; but it will be &s;trange if you &s;hould die cheerfully. You cannot die comfortably, unle&s;s you attain to a full a&s;&s;urance of your gracious &s;tate: and this is not to be expected, becau&s;e not ordinarily obtained, but as the fruit and reward of a long cour&s;e of holy living. How inexpre&s;&s;ibly dreadful mu&s;t it be, to be forced away to the tribu|nal of God, without any firm a&s;&s;urance of the &s;afety of your &s;tate? This may be called dying the death of the wicked, whether you are the children of God, or not. As you would &s;hun &s;uch an exit, let me prevail with you to embrace your pre&s;ent happy opportunity of beginning a godly life. For the &s;ooner you begin, the more likely it is that you may obtain "the full a&s;&s;urance of hope," which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to enable you to face "the king of terrors."</P>
<P N="10">X. AND la&s;tly, I &s;hall propo&s;e to you, my young friends, one motive more, to per&s;uade you to mor|tify your lu&s;ts and be &s;ober-minded. It is the pro&s;|pect of higher degrees of glory in heaven, which
<PB N="48" REF="013238_0053_0F9044885F901400">the more eminent and improved &s;ervants of God &s;hall obtain.</P>
<P>IT is very plain from &s;cripture, that the greater our degrees of grace are here, the greater will be our rewards in the upper world. And, as I have &s;aid before, the earlier you begin to &s;erve God, the greater improvements it is likely you will make in religion, and the greater meetne&s;s for glory will you obtain. It follows, that by early piety you may hope to be laying up extraordinary trea&s;ure for your&s;elves in heaven. Each day you &s;pend in your warfare again&s;t lu&s;t and &s;in, will &s;erve to enhance your glorious reward. Every hour you &s;pend in &s;erving God, you will find the benefit of to all eter|nity. All that you do more than others will add, proportionably, to your "eternal weight of glory." For though you are not to be rewarded for your work, as you can merit nothing of god; &s;till you are to be rewarded, <Q>according as your work &s;hall be,</Q> Rev. xxii. 12. Each degree of increa&s;ed glory is to be con&s;idered as an eternal benefit: who will then be &s;o fooli&s;h as to refu&s;e to begin early in his Lord's work, when the reward annexed, thro' grace, to every part &amp; portion of his work, is eternal?</P>
<P>PERHAPS you will &s;ay, the lowe&s;t place in heaven is the utmo&s;t of your de&s;ire. I grant that the lowe&s;t &s;aint in heaven will be completely happy, as all his de&s;ires will be &s;atisfied. But &s;ince there are dif|ferent degrees of glory, why &s;hould you not a&s;pire after the highe&s;t? And why is this made known to you, in the word of God, unle&s;s it be his will to excite an holy emulation in you. I am &s;ure you
<PB N="49" REF="013238_0054_0F90448924D31BD8">are not capable of a more glorious piece of ambi|tion, than to aim at obtaining the highe&s;t rewards of grace; though you &s;hould always remember they are "of grace," and that you will always be unworthy of the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT, by what was &s;aid in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, it appears to be very doubtful whether you obtain any place at all in heaven, unle&s;s you &s;eek it in your youth. I may therefore exhort you to &s;eek the highe&s;t, that &s;o you may be &s;ure of &s;ome place in the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed. God's children think they cannot &s;tand too high in his favour, nor receive too many marks of it. As it is their temper, to pre&s;s forward to the highe&s;t improvements in grace, can it be thought they have no de&s;ire of the greate&s;t tokens in heaven of God's love &amp; kindne&s;s to them?</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, my young friends, what a long exhor|tation I have given you, in a cheerful compliance with the requirement in my text. An exhortation chiefly adapted, as the text is, to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e of you who are yet unregenerate; but not impro|per to be attended to by every one of you. I might have u&s;ed &s;everal other motives with you; particu|larly, I might have repre&s;ented to you all that the &s;cripture teaches of the joys of the ble&s;&s;ed, and the torments of the damned. But as the&s;e motives are often pre&s;ented to you in addre&s;&s;es to people in general; and as they are not &s;o peculiar to per&s;ons of your age as the mo&s;t that I have u&s;ed, I have not di&s;tinctly urged them. But enough has been &s;aid to leave you without excu&s;e, if you remain un|reclaimed. If you reject this exhortation, I &s;hall
<PB N="50" REF="013238_0055_0F904489F97EE710">have too much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that you will ne|ver be reclaimed. Let me not, I be&s;eech you, lo&s;e this labour upon you, as I have rea&s;on to fear I have lo&s;t much heretofore. Mu&s;t I return and &s;ay, "Lord, who hath belived our report?" Mu&s;t I leave you with the melancholy pro&s;pect that this earne&s;t addre&s;s will not move, but harden you? And dare you run the venture of its ri&s;ing up in judgment again&s;t you at the la&s;t day, and aggravating your condemnation? This, alas! will be the event, if you cannot be per&s;uaded to <Q>turn and live.</Q></P>
<P>BUT I hope better things concerning &s;ome of you. I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that &s;ome of you &s;eem to be endowed with very amiable, and I hope truly gracious qualities. Several of you have un|que&s;tionably begun to be &s;ober-minded: I would hope others are now re&s;olving that they will be|come &s;o. The&s;e have need of direction and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, that they may keep what they have gotten and go forward.&mdash;On this head you may have op|portunity to hear me &s;oon. In the mean time think of the &s;erious truths you have now heard, "and the Lord give you under&s;tanding."</P>

<P>Young men likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the two preceeding di&s;cour&s;es, I explained what it is to be &s;ober-minded; and then ex|horted our young men to become &s;o, with a variety of arguments and motives, which were chiefly adapted to per&s;ons of their &s;tanding, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are not yet in a &s;anctified &s;tate. I flatter my&s;elf that &s;ome of them have &s;o felt the weight of the&s;e arguments, either before or at this hearing of them, as to be inclined to give up them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God, and begin a warfare again&s;t their lu&s;ts and corruptions.&mdash;But as young per&s;ons are commonly much at a lo&s;s how to demean them&s;elves, when they begin to be &s;eriou&s;ly affected with the things of religion, it was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>THIRDLY. To give young men directions what methods to take, if they de&s;ire to obtain and culti|vate inward &s;obriety.&mdash;This therefore is what I &s;hall, depending upon divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, apply my|&s;elf to at this time.&mdash;And,</P>
<P N="1">I. LET me direct you, my young friends, to
<PB N="54" REF="013238_0058_0F90448C4649B208">avoid evil company, and a&s;&s;ociate as much as po&s;|&s;ible with good and virtuous per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I MENTION this fir&s;t, becau&s;e it appears to me to be of the greate&s;t importance. A young man will not only be e&s;teemed to be much the &s;ame as tho&s;e he is mo&s;t familiarly acquainted with; but it is mo&s;t likely, if he is not &s;o at pre&s;ent, he will &s;oon really be &s;o. Young men are pliable; tho&s;e of the be&s;t natures not le&s;s &s;o than others, but often more; &s;o that they will ea&s;ily take the impre&s;&s;ion that is given them, by tho&s;e with whom they mo&s;t frequently conver&s;e. In&s;omuch that, as good com|pany will be likely to do them the greate&s;t good, &s;o evil company will probably do them the greate&s;t hurt. Solomon was fully convinced of this, which made him &s;ay, in general terms, <Q>he that walketh with wi&s;e men &s;hall be wi&s;e; but a companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</Q> Take notice how tho&s;e improve in goodne&s;s, who con&s;ort with holy men; and how fa&s;t tho&s;e "wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e," who are familiar with &s;inners; and you will be con|vinced of the truth of this &s;aying, from your own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>LET me in&s;i&s;t upon it therefore, that you im|mediately break off all unnece&s;&s;ary familiar ac|quaintance with tho&s;e who have not the fear of God before their eyes; unle&s;s they will now turn with you into the right ways of the Lord. Your pre|cious &s;ouls will be in the greate&s;t danger from &s;uch connexions. Therefore your all-merciful God, who de&s;ires not your de&s;truction but your &s;alvati|on, has repeatedly warned you in his word, again&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="013238_0059_0F90448CD8ADF288">keeping &s;uch company. The divine cautions are &s;uch as the&s;e; <Q>walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path, Prov. i. 15.</Q> Go from the pre&s;ence of a "fooli&s;h," that is, a wicked <Q>man, when thou perceive&s;t not in him the lips of knowledge,</Q> Ch. xiv. ver. 7. <Q>Make no friend&s;hip with an angry man, and with the furious thou &s;halt not go, le&s;t thou learn his ways, and get a &s;nare to thy &s;oul,</Q> Ch. xxii. ver. 24, 25. <Q>Be not thou envious again&s;t evil men; neither de&s;ire to be with them,</Q> Ch. xxii. ver. 1.</P>
<P>ATTEND, I be&s;eech you, not only to the&s;e cau|tions, but al&s;o to the conduct of holy David; who &s;ays, <Q>I have not &s;at with vain per&s;ons, neither will I go in with di&s;&s;emblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and I will not &s;it with the wicked.</Q> Take notice al&s;o of his promi&s;es and re&s;olutions, in this re&s;pect. "I will not know," &s;ays he, <Q>a wicked per&s;on;&mdash;he that worketh deceit &s;hall not dwell in my hou&s;e; he that telleth lies &s;hall not tarry in my &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P>YOU had better be quite &s;olitary, than have none but wicked companions. You had better dwell alone in a wilderne&s;s, than a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who fear not God. But, thanks be to the grace of God, this is not the doleful alternative; either to conver&s;e with wicked companions, or abandon &s;ociety.&mdash; There are &s;ome, I hope a good number, even in this wicked place, who are fit companions for &s;e|rious Chri&s;tians, and who&s;e intimate acquaintance will not hurt you, but do you good. Since men are made &s;ociable creatures, and you find &s;omething
<PB N="56" REF="013238_0060_0F90448D8E0A8738">in you &s;trongly demanding a friendly and familiar intercour&s;e with your fellow-creatures, the refu&s;ing to gratify which will be attended with great morti|fication, and real di&s;advantage, be per&s;uaded to &s;eek the acquaintance of tho&s;e who are truly religious. The example of David it is be&s;t you &s;hould follow; who &s;ays, <Q>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</Q></P>
<P>CHANGING of old acquaintance for new will doubtle&s;s be attended with &s;ome difficulty; but this can be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for your paying &s;o little regard to your own &s;piritual intere&s;t, and the ex|pre&s;s commands of God, as to neglect doing it.</P>
<P>YOU may be even ready to think it impracticable, in many ca&s;es, becau&s;e of your nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s and connexions. But I am &s;ure you had better let any temporal bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uffer, if one or the other mu&s;t be, than ri&s;k an intimacy with the profligate and ungodly. This duty however, is not &s;o to be under&s;tood, as if you mu&s;t have no &s;ort of dealing and communication with &s;uch per&s;ons. For it is ob&s;ervable, that where the apo&s;tle warns the Co|rinthians <Q>not to company with fornicators,&mdash;of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters,</Q> he makes this exception, <Q>yet not altogether;&mdash;for then ye mu&s;t needs go out of the world.</Q> He did not require them &s;o entirely to &s;hun &s;uch wicked company, as not to do needful bu&s;ine&s;s with them, and interchange common civi|lities. You may be friendly and courteous to the wor&s;t of men, and even religion requires you to be &s;o, without holding any intimacy with them, and choo&s;ing them for your bo&s;om-companions.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="013238_0061_0F90448E8FBDD4B8">
THE greate&s;t difficulty in this ca&s;e will probably ari&s;e from relation&s;hip: for the want of intimacy with relatives, e&s;pecially with tho&s;e of the &s;ame hou&s;ehold, will be apt to breed unea&s;ine&s;s and jea|lou&s;y. But you &s;hould quit the hou&s;es of wicked relatives, and even of wicked parents, if you are not in your minority, and under their lawful command; unle&s;s you can prevail with them to for&s;ake their practices; excepting in &s;uch ca&s;es, where their need of your help renders it a work of piety to abide with them.</P>
<P>LET me &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;e tho&s;e of you, who are at liberty to choo&s;e your places of abode, to enter, if po&s;&s;ible, into families where religious orders are ob|&s;erved; and where the morning, and evening &s;acri|fices are not neglected. This will be a means of keeping up in your &s;ouls a wakeful &s;en&s;e of divine things. Avoid prayerle&s;s hou&s;es as you would in|fected ones: for &s;uch families, it is to be feared, are not in the way of God's ble&s;&s;ing. You may well fear God's judgments, if you dwell in &s;uch places: for divine fury, you may ju&s;tly expect, will be pour|ed out, &s;ooner or later, <Q>on the families that call not on his name.</Q></P>
<P>YOU can hardly conceive how much depends up|on your making a wi&s;e choice of your mo&s;t intimate companions. Religious friends will be continually guarding you again&s;t temptations; reminding you of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s, vilene&s;s, and odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in; prompting and quickening you to the practice of every holy duty, and Chri&s;tian virtue.</P>
<P>AND of all companions, choo&s;ing a bo&s;om friend
<PB N="58" REF="013238_0062_0F90448F1E5B83D0">of the other &s;ex for life, is a matter of more &s;erious importance than mo&s;t young men &s;eem to imagine. Let tho&s;e of you who have this yet to do, be care|ful to do it con&s;iderately, and prayerfully, in the fear of God, and with an eye to the welfare of your &s;ouls. For if you &s;hould form this dear connexion with &s;uch as are not governed by religious principles; with &s;uch as affect every thing in fa&s;hion, let it be never &s;o unrea&s;onable and &s;inful; with &s;uch as have no command over their appetites, and pa&s;&s;ions, fare|well to all your &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions. Whatever pi|ous re&s;olutions you have formed, they will be likely to vani&s;h as the morning cloud. But if you choo&s;e tho&s;e who are actuated by the love and fear of God, and who&s;e ornament is "a meek and quiet &s;pirit," they will help you forward in religion, guard you again&s;t &s;in and temptation, and &s;weetly attract you to the love and practice of univer&s;al holine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE great apo&s;tle Paul did not think it beneath him, to direct and exhort men on this head. <Q>Be not unequally yoked, &s;ays he, with unbelievers:</Q> and el&s;ewhere, <Q>let him that marrieth marry in the Lord.</Q>&mdash;And I &s;hould think it advi&s;able for you to choo&s;e to match, other things being equal, with tho&s;e who are, by education or choice, of the &s;ame denomination of Chri&s;tians with your&s;elves: becau&s;e doing otherwi&s;e has often proved to be the means of great inconveniences, if not of the alienation of affections.</P>
<P>THOSE of you, my young friends, who have been left to lead apparently wicked lives, may be in &s;ome doubt, whether religious per&s;ons will
<PB N="59" REF="013238_0063_0F90448FD9FE8A80">&s;uffer you to become their intimates; becau&s;e they are warned again&s;t an intimacy with the wicked. But they are obliged to avoid you no longer than you remain wicked. If you repent, and acknow|ledge your &s;orrow for your &s;ins, they are welcome, yea, they are obliged to "re&s;tore" you to their af|fections, "in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s." And they will be &s;o rejoiced, when they &s;ee you <Q>bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</Q> that they will love and care&s;s you as much as if you had been &s;erious from your cradles: perhaps more; for a remark|able change in your conduct, and that humility which appears in your condemning your own form|er cour&s;es, will be con&s;idered as additional proofs of your &s;anctification, beyond what tho&s;e who are &s;anctified from infancy can produce. So that you need not doubt being able to form as large, and as intimate an acquaintance with religious per&s;ons, as will be advantageous to you.</P>
<P>I MUST not clo&s;e this direction, without recom|mending to you a practice which young men &s;ome times go into, of a&s;&s;embling in &s;ome private place, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and edify one another with exerci&s;es of de|votion. I cannot but think that an evening &s;pent, now and then, in this manner, would be of &s;ome &s;piritual advantage to you. It would, at lea&s;t, help to wear off that &s;hyne&s;s and ba&s;hfulne&s;s concerning religious matters, which is &s;o common among you, and hurtful to you. You would be likely to en|courage and &s;trengthen one another to per&s;i&s;t in your good re&s;olutions; and it would &s;erve as a &s;chool to prepare you to carry on the wor&s;hip of God in
<PB N="60" REF="013238_0064_0F904490ACD8CA08">your own families. On this la&s;t account, I have known &s;ome, from their own experience, give a frank and full te&s;timony in favour of this practice; who were per&s;uaded they never &s;hould have been brought to perform family prayers, had they not been members of &s;uch a religious &s;ociety. It would rejoice the hearts of many, if &s;ome of our young men would engage them&s;elves in &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE next piece of advice I would give you, in order to your obtaining and cultivating hearty &s;o|briety, is, that you be con&s;tant and fervent in your &s;ecret devotions.</P>
<P>SECRET prayer is &s;o &s;trictly in&s;tituted, or plainly commanded, by the divine per&s;on who died for you, that you can have no rea&s;on in the world to think your&s;elves true Chri&s;tians, &s;o long as you live in the neglect of it. He bids you <Q>enter into your clo&s;et, and when you have &s;hut the door, pray to your father which is in &s;ecret.</Q> And the motive he adds, to encourage you to this duty, is &s;o full of grace and goodne&s;s, that it &s;eems &s;trange that &s;uch needy, impotent creatures as men are, can ever choo&s;e to neglect it. <Q>Pray to thy father which is in &s;ecret, and thy father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret &s;hall reward thee openly.</Q> Matth. vi. 6. Such a pro|mi&s;e of God's hearing your prayers will render your neglect of praying in &s;ecret a fooli&s;h, and inexcu&s;a|ble piece of di&s;obedience. You cannot but know that you want to receive of God many good things, both for &s;oul and body: and yet, when you can have them for a&s;king, will you neglect to a&s;k? Can you de&s;ire to have your wants &s;upplied, upon any ea&s;ier terms?</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="013238_0065_0F9044914C7BC918">
Is not this the highe&s;t honour and privilege that can be vouch&s;afed you? If you might have a &s;ecret interview with your earthly &s;overeign, as often as you plea&s;ed, and were a&s;&s;ured that he would grant you any thing you &s;hould reque&s;t of him, would you not value your&s;elves upon it? Would you need any other motives to make you accept of &s;uch a fa|vour? You would be thought madmen, if you did. How much wor&s;e than mad are you then, if you &s;light, and neglect &s;uch an intercour&s;e with the King of kings? e&s;pecially as he will puni&s;h you with eter|nal de&s;truction, if you neglect it.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE few, or none, of you wholly neglect &s;ecret prayer: but I would have you con&s;tant, and fervent in it. You &s;hould have your daily, &s;tated times for this duty, and let no &s;mall thing ever put you by: and you &s;hould be as much in earne&s;t, and as affectionate as po&s;&s;ible in your addre&s;s to God. This is the right way of praying: the only &s;ure way to obtain what you a&s;k. You mu&s;t <Q>continue in prayer, and watch in the &s;ame,</Q> Col. iv. 2.</P>
<P>As it is not in your own power to become hear|tily religious, you mu&s;t go to God to make you &s;o. Fervent and per&s;evering prayer is the mo&s;t impor|tant and likely means to obtain this nece&s;&s;ary favour of God. There is a good old &s;aying that you ought to con&s;ider, <Q>praying will make thee leave &s;inning, or &s;inning will make thee leave praying.</Q> This is doubtle&s;s true, if we under&s;tand fervent and im|portunate praying. So that you mu&s;t not abate the frequency, nor the fervency of your prayers, if God does not immediately, or if he does not for a long
<PB N="62" REF="013238_0066_0F904492064DB560">time, grant the things you pray for. God will &s;end an an&s;wer in the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and that &s;ea&s;on may not be at hand. Sometimes God &s;ees it is fit that your patience and per&s;everance &s;hould be tried, before your reque&s;ts are granted. Chri&s;t <Q>&s;pake a parable to the end that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</Q> in which he gives you rea&s;on to expect that uncea&s;ing importunity will finally prevail. Take heed then that you do not faint in this duty; but let God's delaying to ble&s;s you make you more and more importunate For if you give over, your good beginnings will end in de&s;truction: but if you per&s;i&s;t, the work of grace will doubtle&s;s be wrought.</P>
<P>CRY mightily to God then, and do not de&s;pond. Re&s;olve as Jacob, that you will not let him go till he ble&s;&s;es you. Cry as David did, <Q>create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right &s;pirit in me. Ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence; and take not thy holy &s;pirit from me.</Q> Say un|to him, Lord, &s;ubdue the lu&s;ts and corruptions that are in me. Take away that bias to evil that has hitherto governed me; and make me a partaker of the divine nature; that &s;o, for the future, I may live &s;uch a life as becomes a rational creature.&mdash;The greater variety of expre&s;&s;ions you u&s;e, in your ad|dre&s;&s;es to God for renewing grace, the more likely you will be to affect your&s;elves with your need of it, and the higher will your de&s;ires after it ari&s;e: and, in proportion, you will be the more likely &s;oon to obtain it.</P>
<P>Is there any need of my adding this caution, that
<PB N="63" REF="013238_0067_0F904492F65CF630">when you find God has changed your hearts, you are not to lay a&s;ide prayer? It is to be expected that you will then have your hearts &s;o engaged in the exer|ci&s;e, that you will continue in it of your own ac|cord. Prayer is the very breath of the regenerate. Saul was no &s;ooner converted, than it was &s;aid of him, "behold he prayeth."</P>
<P>BUT the regenerate have their dull frames, when prayer appears burden&s;ome: they are therefore to be reminded of their con&s;tant need of this holy ex|erci&s;e. It is as nece&s;&s;ary for their improvement, and per&s;everance in holine&s;s, as for their beginning in it. As long as you are needy and dependent, &s;o long will prayer be nece&s;&s;ary for you: and that will be as long as you live. As you will always need &s;upplies of grace, you mu&s;t always go to the foun|tain-head for them. Religion is a continued war|fare; and you are not to expect you &s;hall conquer your &s;piritual enemies, unle&s;s you repair to the Cap|tain of your &s;alvation, that you may <Q>receive of his fullne&s;s.</Q> You mu&s;t go to him for daily a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in your daily conflicts with Satan, the world, and lu&s;t.</P>
<P>ONE thing is to be remembered in your &s;ecret conver&s;e with God; which is, whenever you pray, to make confe&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins to God, a part of your addre&s;&s;es to him. This is the way to make you mode&s;t and humble in your reque&s;ts for mer|cies: it is agreeable to &s;cripture-examples of pray|ing; and it will make you &s;en&s;ible of the propriety, and nece&s;&s;ity of putting up all your petitions in the name of our glorious Mediator.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="013238_0068_0F90449759F60AB8">
YOU &s;hould al&s;o, in your prayers, give thanks for mercies received. This is the more effectual method of begging. You will always have abun|dant rea&s;on for thank&s;giving, before, as well as after your real conver&s;ion to holine&s;s. And if you appear ungrateful, or forgetful of pa&s;t mercies, how can you expect to obtain new ones? The apo&s;tle Paul directs men to join thank&s;giving to petition in their prayers. "In every thing," &s;ays he, <Q>by prayer, and &s;upplication, together with thank&s;giving, let your reque&s;t be made known to God.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. IF you de&s;ire to attain to true &s;obriety, guard, as much as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t fa&s;hionable vices. When vices become fa&s;hionable, they cea&s;e to appear fright|ful and alarming to inexperienced and un&s;u&s;pecting youth. If you hear of a crime in any, that is but &s;eldom committed within your knowledge, you are immediately &s;hocked; and your hearts ri&s;e with &s;uch dete&s;tation of it, that you are in little or no danger of following the example. But vices that are commonly practi&s;ed before your faces, gradu|ally appear le&s;s and le&s;s di&s;gu&s;tful, 'till you lo&s;e &s;ight of the deformity of them: and then you are in immediate danger of falling into the practice of them. Or el&s;e, if you have &s;een them practi&s;ed from your infancy, they never &s;hocked you at all. Here it is that your greate&s;t danger lies; here then you have need of the greate&s;t caution.</P>
<P>NOTHING can &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of your keeping a con&s;tant guard again&s;t vices of this kind; unle&s;s no vice were become fa&s;hionable. But this
<PB N="65" REF="013238_0069_0F904498D12C31C8">is &s;o far from the truth, that it is not to be que&s;ti|oned. It is lamentably true, that &s;ome vices are practi&s;ed by &s;o many, that they mu&s;t be called fa|&s;hionable, though there are many who avoid them: ju&s;t as &s;ome modes of dre&s;s are fa&s;hionable, though there are many who will not run into them.&mdash; Under this head, I mu&s;t caution you,</P>
<P N="1">1. To be upon your guard again&s;t all profane &s;wearing and cur&s;ing; u&s;ing the &s;acred name of your Maker with irreverence, and other ways of &s;peaking that are evidently contrary to that &s;impli|city of &s;peech, which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour enjoins. The tongue is &s;o active a member, that it will be apt to run into profanity, with very little temptati|on, if it is not &s;trictly guarded. And indeed, it &s;eems there is as little temptation to commit this &s;in, as any that is practi&s;ed. It is &s;hocking to think how much of this horrid language is to be heard in our &s;treets; and how many of our dear young peo|ple have learnt to profane the holy and awful name of the great God, without remor&s;e. As you would guard your&s;elves again&s;t this, remember tho&s;e aw|ful words delivered by God upon mount Sinai, <Q>Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain.</Q> Profane per&s;ons are ab&s;olutely &s;hut out from mercy, while they remain unreclaimed; &s;hut out both by law and go&s;pel. God "will not hold them guiltle&s;s:" even the blood of Chri&s;t, through which penitent &s;inners are held guiltle&s;s, will not avert the wrath
<PB N="66" REF="013238_0070_0F904499150CA818">of God from profane per&s;ons, nor remove their guilt, till they cea&s;e to be what they are. God will not con&s;ider it as a &s;in of infirmity, which is com|patible with a &s;tate of grace.&mdash;Con&s;ider al&s;o how your ble&s;&s;ed Lord has explained this command, in his &s;ermon on the Mount: where he makes it pro|hibit &s;wearing either by God, or any of his crea|tures, in common conver&s;ation, as well as fal&s;e &s;wearing and breach of vows: and how he guards this commandment, by &s;aying, <Q>Let your com|munication be, yea, yea; any, nay: for what|&s;oever is more than the&s;e, cometh of evil:</Q> that is, content your&s;elves with u&s;ing a repeated arfirm|ation, or negation, in your common intercour&s;e with one another; for all beyond this is wrong. The due con&s;ideration of this will make you careful, not only to avoid fal&s;e and profane &s;wearing; but all profane interjections and exclamations; all need|le&s;s and irreverent mention of the names and titles of the &s;upreme being, or what relates to him; all light &s;peaking of &s;acred things; all pawning of your faith, &s;ouls, &s;alvation, word, or honour; and whatever other ways of &s;peaking evidently bor|dering upon profanene&s;s, and tending to lead to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER &s;in I would here warn you again&s;t, is that deceit which is too commonly practi&s;ed in conver&s;ation: particularly, again&s;t backbiting, on the one hand, and flattery, on the other; which are &s;ome of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;ins of the tongue. A &s;ort of per&s;ons that are very numerous, are &s;uch as will be &s;o fair and bland to your faces, that you
<PB N="67" REF="013238_0071_0F90449993356778">are ready to think them your be&s;t friends; but &s;ay &s;o much again&s;t you, behind your backs, that others take them to be your wor&s;t enemies. I mention the&s;e two vices in conjunction, becau&s;e they are commonly found in the &s;ame per&s;ons, and both are founded in deceit. Flattery is a dete&s;table vice, not only as it &s;hews a bad mind, and com|monly &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h, ba&s;e de&s;ign, but as it produces baneful effects. We are not &s;o apt to dete&s;t our flatterers as our &s;landerers; though the former will probably do us as much mi&s;chief as the latter. But both are evil workers, and both are condemned in God's word. Pro. xvii. 15. <Q>He that ju&s;tifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the ju&s;t, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</Q>&mdash; As you would keep clear of flattery and detraction, make it your rule to prai&s;e the good in their ab|&s;ence, rather than in their pre&s;ence; and to con|demn the bad, rather in their pre&s;ence than when they are ab&s;ent. Or, to &s;ay no evil of any per&s;on behind his back, that you would not more willingly &s;ay to his face: and to &s;ay no good of any to his face, that you would not rather &s;ay behind his back.</P>
<P N="3">3. EXCESSIVE drinking is another too fa&s;hion|able vice, of which I would here warn you, my young friends, to beware. For this is &s;o much practi&s;ed, that you will be often in the way of its temptation.</P>
<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure to think, that but few of you have been gro&s;sly faulty in this matter hitherto. It is not common, for tho&s;e who are very young, to go any great length in this wickedne&s;s. But as you
<PB N="68" REF="013238_0072_0F90449A42BB8DF0">grow older, your danger from this quarter will in|crea&s;e. Cultivate then, I be&s;eech you, &s;uch an early abhorrence of it, and keep at &s;o great a di&s;tance from all temptations to it, that, as you grow older, its allurements may not be likely to endanger your virtue. Believe me, this is one of the mo&s;t com|prehen&s;ively de&s;tructive of all vices: as well as mo&s;t directly contrary to that Chri&s;tian &s;obriety, to which I have been exhorting you. If you once get into this way, you will &s;ee an end of all your religious impre&s;&s;ions, and good re&s;olutions: it will transform you into the mo&s;t vile of all irrational creatures: it will deaden all the &s;en&s;ibility of your con&s;ciences: it will unfit you to &s;erve God, your brethren, or your|&s;elves: it will lay you open to a multitude of temp|tations; and it will be de&s;tructive to your e&s;tates, reputations, health, families, bodies and &s;ouls. This, as well as all other &s;ins, may be forgiven up|on repentance: but it renders repentance more hopele&s;s than almo&s;t any other &s;ins; for but very few, who have gone far in this way, are ever re|claimed. They are generally, <Q>led captive by Sa|tan at his will,</Q> till they are plunged into reme|dile&s;s ruin.&mdash;As you love your &s;ouls then, let me per&s;uade you to keep at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance from this &s;in, and fly all occa&s;ions and temptations there|unto: for you are a&s;&s;ured in God's word, that "drunkards &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God."</P>
<P>I WILL proceed no further with this head of di&s;|cour&s;e, le&s;t &s;ome may be tempted to think me cen|&s;orious, in repre&s;enting too many vices as fa&s;hion|able.
<PB N="69" REF="013238_0073_0F90449B0CD85480">I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, There are no others nearly as much &s;o, as the&s;e which I have mentioned: but from the&s;e, and all the re&s;t, I would hope my young hearers will keep them&s;elves, through the re|&s;training and a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace of God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I WOULD advi&s;e you, my dear youths, e&s;pe|cially to beware of tho&s;e vices, to which youth is e&s;pecially prone. Men are mo&s;t inclined to &s;ome particular &s;ins in one &s;tage of life, and to others in another. Youth, middle age, and old age have their peculiar vices. It is incumbent upon you to be mo&s;t upon your guard where your danger is greate&s;t: that is, again&s;t tho&s;e enormities, into which it may be feared your youthful blood will be apt to hurry you. Whatever you do, you mu&s;t &s;ee that you "flee youthful lu&s;ts:" the apo&s;tle Paul thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give this exhortation to young Timothy, tho' he was an eminently religious youth. You will not therefore be offended, if I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to urge the &s;ame upon you. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;ins of uncleanne&s;s may be allowed to &s;tand foremo&s;t in the catalogue of youthful lu&s;ts. Again&s;t the&s;e therefore, in every kind and degree, too abominable to bear a di&s;tinct mention, I mu&s;t be allowed, with the greate&s;t zeal and concern, to warn you. Flatter not your&s;elves that you are in no danger: for many who have thought them&s;elves as &s;ecure as the be&s;t of you can think your&s;elves, have been overcome and de&s;troyed by lu&s;t.</P>
<P>REMEMBER that the&s;e &s;ins are dangerous ene|mies to your &s;ouls. You are therefore commanded
<PB N="70" REF="013238_0074_0F90449D289D85A0">to <Q>ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the &s;oul.</Q> Numberle&s;s young men have fell down wounded and &s;lam by them.</P>
<P>CONSIDER that your bodies, as well as your &s;ouls, are redeemed by the blood of Chri&s;t: and that your bodies are de&s;igned for "temples of the Holy Gho&s;t." &mdash;You are therefore exhorted to <Q>po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els in &s;anctification and honour. Know ye not,</Q> &s;aith the apo&s;tle Paul, <Q>that your bodies are the members of Chri&s;t? Shall I then take the mem|bers of Chri&s;t, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</Q></P>
<P>IF you burn in the fire of lu&s;t here, you &s;hall burn in the fire of Hell hereafter, unle&s;s a deep and thorough repentance intervenes. God's word a&s;|&s;ures you <Q>that no whoremonger, nor unclean per|&s;on&mdash;hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God:</Q> and that <Q>for the&s;e things &s;ake, cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di&s;obedience.</Q></P>
<P>As you would &s;hun all gro&s;s acts of uncleanne&s;s, be upon your guard again&s;t every thing that leads thereunto. Avoid that "filthine&s;s" of conver&s;ati|on, "fooli&s;h talking," and ob&s;cene <Q>je&s;ting, which is not convenient;</Q> and which is condemned by the apo&s;tle as unfit, becau&s;e it kindles the fire of lu&s;t, and leads per&s;ons to acts of uncleanne&s;s.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY avoid, as you would avoid the wor&s;t contagion, the company of per&s;ons of light conver&s;ation, and ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected virtue. Fly from the lap of Delilah. <Q>Her feet go down to the
<PB N="71" REF="013238_0075_0F90449D5BF253D0">dead,</Q> as the wi&s;e king Solomon tells you, <Q>and her &s;teps take hold on hell:&mdash;her hou&s;e is the way to hell, leading down to the chambers of death:&mdash;the dead are there, and her gue&s;ts are in the depths of hell.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. LET me intreat you to guard again&s;t that ir|reverence towards parents, and other &s;uperiours, which young men are too apt to fall into. Youth is commonly a great deal too forward, a&s;&s;uming, &s;elf-conceited, and ready to de&s;pi&s;e their &s;uperiours in age and &s;tation; and accordingly to treat them with di&s;re&s;pect. You are not to imagine irreve|rence towards &s;uperiours a venial fault: for it is a downright piece of immorality, and rebellion again&s;t God. It is contrary to rea&s;on, and nature. The fifth commandment forbids it, &s;aying, <Q>Honour thy father and thy mother.</Q> Only parents are in&s;tanced in the command; but, as the decalogue comprehends the whole &s;y&s;tem of morality, &s;o this command mu&s;t be under&s;tood to require all that re|verence, honour, and re&s;pect which we owe to our &s;uperiours, whether parents or others. If you would do your duty in this re&s;pect, con&s;ider the rea|&s;on God has annexed to the command; namely, <Q>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</Q> So that you &s;ee, if you honour your &s;uperiours, you may hope for long life, and pro&s;perity in the world, &s;o far as it &s;hall be for the glory of God and your own good. But in ca&s;e you do contrary to this duty, you are under&s;tood to be threatened with the contrary of
<PB N="72" REF="013238_0076_0F90449E558E8A18">this promi&s;e; namely, to be cut off by an untimely death. And this you are the rather to fear, be|cau&s;e of a remarkable in&s;tance of it, that you find on &s;acred record; of a company of children who were devoured by wild bea&s;ts, becau&s;e they mock|ed a prophet of the Lord, &s;aying, <Q>Go up thou bald-head, go up thou bald-head.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. As the volatility of youth often makes them aver&s;e to clo&s;e application; to diligent employment, either of the head or hands; you &s;hould be &s;ure to be upon your guard again&s;t idlene&s;s. Idlene&s;s will not only hurt your temporal intere&s;t; but it will be the greate&s;t enemy of your &s;ouls. If you do not keep out of idlene&s;s, you will not keep clear of &s;in: for the bare wa&s;ting of your precious time is a &s;in that you mu&s;t give a &s;trict account of in the day of judgment. And idlene&s;s will expo&s;e you to num|berle&s;s temptations. He that is idle has nothing to do, but to &s;erve Satan: and if you are idle, he will &s;oon employ you in his bu&s;ine&s;s. Keep your&s;elves therefore diligently employed, in doing &s;omething or other for your &s;ouls or bodies; for the good of your&s;elves, or your fellow-creatures. This will be for your honour and your intere&s;t; and it will be an hopeful means of making you &s;ober and religious.</P>
<P N="4">4. BEWARE of angry re&s;entments, and revenge. Youthful blood is generally too apt to be thrown into a ferment, on receiving an affront, or any real or &s;uppo&s;ed injury. You cannot be &s;ober-minded &s;o long as your angry pa&s;&s;ions have the dominion over you, and the guidance of your conduct. This
<PB N="73" REF="013238_0077_0F90449ED37771B8">is as oppo&s;ite to it as any thing can be. True Chri&s;|tian &s;obriety very much con&s;i&s;ts in the government of the pa&s;&s;ions, not only the concupi&s;cible, but the ira&s;cible.</P>
<P>TO indulge anger again&s;t your fellow-creatures, is the way to make your&s;elves very unhappy at pre|&s;ent: not only as it is an unea&s;y and painful agita|tion of the &s;pirits, but as it is apt to hurry men in|to the perpetration of ra&s;h and violent deeds, which make work for a bitter repentance.</P>
<P>INDULGED anger gratifies your grand adver&s;ary, and gives him great advantage again&s;t you. There|fore you are thus exhorted, <Q>Let not the &s;un go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the Devil.</Q> In&s;tead of &s;uffering anger to rankle in|to hatred, you &s;hould take care to make up all dif|ferences &s;peedily. To per&s;wade you hereunto, you &s;hould often con&s;ider how contrary anger and re|venge are to the example of your Saviour, which you are bound to follow; <Q>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again, but &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly;</Q> and who poured out his dying breath, in apologizing and praying for the forgivene&s;s of his blood-thir&s;ty per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hould al&s;o remember how contrary the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are to the &s;pirit, and genius of Chri&s;t's Go&s;|pel; in which you are commanded <Q>not to re&s;i&s;t evil; but to overcome evil with good,</Q> with kind and charitable deeds: to "love your enemies" to &s;uch a degree as to "feed" them, when they are
<PB N="74" REF="013238_0078_0F90449F89C05E50">"hungry," and to "clothe" them, when they are "naked;" to &s;tand ready to do good, at all times, "to them that hate you;" and to "pray" for the be&s;t of heaven's ble&s;&s;ings, even pardon, grace and glory, to be be&s;towed upon <Q>them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you, and per&s;ecute you.</Q></P>
<P>LET me remind you, that <Q>a meek and quiet &s;pirit is, in the &s;ight of God, of &s;o great price,</Q> that he will not di&s;pen&s;e with the want of it. If you do not &s;hew "mercy" to your fellow-creatures, you will "have judgment without mercy" from God. <Q>If you forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your father which is in heaven for|give your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>LASTLY, Avoid &s;inful ambition: for it is one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive things to your pre&s;ent happine&s;s, as well as an effectual bar in the way of your be|coming &s;ober-minded. I &s;ay &s;inful ambition, be|cau&s;e there are kinds and degrees of ambition, that are laudable and beneficial. But a&s;piring after too high things in the world will make you continually di&s;contented with your &s;tation, let it be what it will: it will make &s;laves of you: it will prevent your u&s;ing the means of grace with proper attention and di|ligence: it will draw you into an imitation of the vices of the great; and it will make you &s;tick at no kind of &s;ecret wickedne&s;s to advance your&s;elves. If you love either pre&s;ent or future happine&s;s, avoid this lu&s;t, and be &s;atisfied with the &s;tations, which God has allotted you in the world. Your ambiti|ous &s;chemes, with which you are apt to amu&s;e your|&s;elves
<PB N="75" REF="013238_0079_0F8FB552B11EBCD0">in your youth, will mo&s;t probably be fru&s;|trated: but if you &s;hould attain to the height of your wi&s;hes, you would not increa&s;e your happi|ne&s;s by it. For he that is not contented with a middling &s;tation, will not be &s;atisfied with the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>FOLLOW the&s;e directions, my young friends, if you de&s;ire to attain to, and improve in Chri&s;tian &s;obriety. Several more I propo&s;ed to give you; but they mu&s;t be left till another opportunity.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>TITUS II. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Young men likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e I delivered upon this &s;ub|ject, I began to give the young men of this congregation directions what methods to take, if they de&s;ire to become &s;ober-minded, or heartily religious. I &s;hewed them,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT they mu&s;t avoid evil company, and a&s;&s;ociate with the virtuous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT they mu&s;t be con&s;tant and fervent in &s;ecret devotions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT they mu&s;t guard, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, again&s;t fa&s;hionable vices. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. That they mu&s;t e&s;pecially beware of tho&s;e vices, to which youth is mo&s;t prone.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THESE directions were given them, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition that they were almo&s;t per&s;waded to be Chri&s;|tians; or at lea&s;t, that they had begun to have &s;ome inclination to give them&s;elves up to the &s;ervice of God. If I may now have their &s;erious attention, I &s;hall cheerfully go on to give them &s;ome further directions, the ob&s;ervance of which will be of great advantage to their &s;piritual intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The next thing is,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="80" REF="013238_0082_0F9044A1126E5688">
V. To direct you to beware of enthu&s;ia&s;m. By enthu&s;ia&s;m I would be under&s;tood to mean, the fervour of an over-heated and extravagant imagi|nation, mi&s;taken, either for divine revelation, or an extraordinary intercour&s;e with the &s;pirit of God. Enthu&s;ia&s;m, in this &s;en&s;e, will be allowed by all, to be an enemy to religion. And I am &s;ure, no|thing can be more incon&s;i&s;tent with internal &s;o|briety. As it con&s;i&s;ts in the irregularity of the pa&s;|&s;ions, it is intemperance; and as it is mi&s;taken for miraculous communications from heaven, it is of a very dangerous tendency. For per&s;ons of an en|thu&s;ia&s;tick turn are in danger of placing religion, almo&s;t entirely, in extacies and rapturous feelings, in high flights of the imagination and ebullitions of the pa&s;&s;ions. The con&s;equences of which are, that they overlook and neglect the e&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity, which mainly con&s;i&s;t in uniform, prac|tical godline&s;s, or evangelical obedience; are ready to fall into de&s;pair, when they are mo&s;t calm and compo&s;ed, becau&s;e they cannot find tho&s;e agitati|ons of &s;pirit in them&s;elves, in which they imagine religion con&s;i&s;ts: and are apt to condemn all per|&s;ons as carnal and unconverted, who have not ex|perienced their irregular flights; and &s;o become wanting in that charity, which it is the principle de&s;ign of religion to promote.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;temper of mind is oftentimes mi&s;taken for holy zeal: and the mo&s;t zealous per&s;ons, other things being equal, perhaps are the mo&s;t likely to run into it. True zeal is an important virtue;
<PB N="81" REF="013238_0083_0F9044A22050FAD0">and it is impo&s;&s;ible to be too zealou&s;ly engaged in religion, &s;o long as our zeal is guided and tempered with prudence. But enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;o hurtful an excre&s;cence of religion, that you have need to be upon your guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P>YOUNG per&s;ons, under their fir&s;t religious awaken|ings, are more in danger of this, than any other &s;ort of per&s;ons: for they have not much religious knowledge to balla&s;t their minds; and they have &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, which like too much &s;ail, hurry them into this vortex, and into many extravagances and dangers. If any of you, my young friends, are now ju&s;t beginning to be religious, be watch|ful even over tho&s;e motions of your hearts, which &s;eem to be religious ones; le&s;t through the artifice of Satan, who can transform him&s;elf <Q>into an angel of light,</Q> you fall into wild and vi&s;ionary frames; which may make your ca&s;e wor&s;e than it was before. You &s;hould bring all your opinions, your impre&s;&s;ions and &s;ugge&s;tions to the touch&s;tone, "to the law and to the te&s;timony;" and not ra&s;hly take it for granted, that you are &s;o guided by the Holy Gho&s;t that you cannot err.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THE next error I would warn you again&s;t, is &s;piritual pride: which is nearly related to enthu|&s;ia&s;m, and often attends it.</P>
<P>WHEN you have formed &s;ome good re&s;olutions; and in any mea&s;ure, have reformed your carele&s;s and vitious lives; the next thing that Satan will endeavour to tempt you to, will be to draw up an ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion that you are &s;avingly converted: That &s;o you may give over your endeavours, con|cluding
<PB N="82" REF="013238_0084_0F9044A29F5DB578">that all is well with you; &s;o much better than the &s;tate of others, that you may be puffed up with pride. Spiritual pride is oppo&s;ed in holy writ, to &s;obriety; therefore I may pertinently here warn you again&s;t it, in the language of Paul to the Ro|mans; <Q>not to think more highly of your&s;elves, than you ought to think; but to think &s;oberly.</Q></P>
<P>WHILE you are in an unrenewed &s;tate, I &s;uppo&s;e it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for you to have too low an opi|nion of your own goodne&s;s. For you are odious and dete&s;table in the &s;ight of God, and more vile than the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. God compares &s;inners to the mo&s;t loath&s;ome and dete&s;ted things in nature; and the more conformable your opinion is to his, the more ju&s;t it is. Therefore you &s;hould "abhor" your&s;elves, "and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes;" con|fe&s;&s;ing that you de&s;erve no good, but every evil at the hand of God.</P>
<P>AND after you find that you are renewed, you mu&s;t &s;till "put on humblene&s;s, of mind." For you may then well &s;ay "what have we that we did not receive? Surely it is no rea&s;on why you &s;hould value your&s;elves highly, that you have received more unde&s;erved mercy than others; but on the contrary, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch gifts is, in rea&s;on, a con&s;tant call to humility and &s;elf-aba&s;ement. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays to &s;ome who were too much elated, on account of &s;ome &s;piritual advantages, <Q>who maketh thee to differ from another? And what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not received it.</Q> Since it is <Q>by the
<PB N="83" REF="013238_0085_0F9044A6C15602B0">grace of God,</Q> that his children are what they are, they are &s;hut out from all boa&s;ting, and ought to entertain a low opinion of their own worthine&s;s, even although they had got nearer to perfection, than ever any did before.</P>
<P>BUT another rea&s;on for humility is, that notwith|&s;tanding the grace of God that may appear in you, you are far from a total conformity to the will and law of God. Your falls into &s;in are &s;o frequent, after the great change is wrought, and your defects in duty &s;o many and great, that you may well &s;ay with David, <Q>if thou Lord &s;houlde&s;t mark iniquities; O Lord, who &s;hall &s;tand?</Q> A &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things &s;hould keep you &s;o low in your &s;elf-e&s;tima|tion, as to direct the eye of your faith in Chri&s;t, and make you tru&s;t in his merit and worthine&s;s, for acceptance with God.</P>
<P>YOU are chargeable with &s;piritual pride, when you are in&s;en&s;ible of, and unhumbled for your de|fects in duty; when you a&s;&s;ume to your&s;elves the honour of what is gracious in you; and when you think you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more goodne&s;s than you really are. Again&s;t all which you cannot be too much upon your guard; for pride is a &s;in that ea|&s;ily be&s;ets mo&s;t men; and none are more in danger of it than young per&s;ons, who have ju&s;t begun to be religious. This made the apo&s;tle give that di|rection to Timothy, concerning the appointment of a bi&s;hop, <Q>not a novice, le&s;t being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</Q></P>
<P>LET your &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and religious improve|ments be what they may, in early youth, it would
<PB N="84" REF="013238_0086_0F9044A81A8D41A8">be be&s;t for you to con&s;ider your&s;elves as but babes in Chri&s;t; that &s;o you may not grow indolent and inactive in the work of God, being &s;wollen with a fond conceit of your high attainments: But <Q>for|getting tho&s;e things that are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e things which are before, pre&s;s</Q> forward, as the apo&s;tle did, <Q>toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q></P>
<P N="12">VII. IF you would obtain and cultivate true &s;o|berne&s;s of mind, let me advi&s;e you to give your|&s;elves much to reading.</P>
<P>READING is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the improve|ment of young minds; and e&s;pecially to &s;tore them with a nece&s;&s;ary fund of religious knowledge. The apo&s;tolick advice to young Timothy was to give him&s;elf, among other things, "to reading." It is not only needful for a young mini&s;ter as Timothy was; but more or le&s;s &s;o for every young Chri&s;tian, let him be in ever &s;o private a &s;tation. For they who wholly neglect it are found to be deplorably ignorant of things that concern their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THERE are none of you, my young friends, but have &s;ome lei&s;ure for this profitable exerci&s;e: at lea&s;t upon the Lords's days, and during &s;ome other intermi&s;&s;ions of bu&s;ine&s;s and labour.</P>
<P>I DO not mean to encourage you to read all man|ner of books that come to hand, whether good or bad. There are many extant, con&s;i&s;ting of profane and ob&s;cene plays and romances, or loo&s;e poems and &s;ongs; the reading of which tend to corrupt, vitiate and de&s;troy young per&s;ons; and the publica|tion of them has done infinite mi&s;chief in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="013238_0087_0F9044A881F41F40">
IT may be well for tho&s;e of you who have much lei&s;ure, to read hi&s;tory, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and &s;ome books that treat on the various arts and &s;cien|ces; e&s;pecially on tho&s;e which will be mo&s;t likely to be beneficial to you, and fit you to &s;erve your ge|neration the better, in your particular &s;tations of life.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e of you who have little lei&s;ure, had better confine your reading chiefly to books on di|vine and religious &s;ubjects. And among the&s;e, it will not be be&s;t to &s;pend much of your time on tho&s;e which are controver&s;ial; unle&s;s you had time to read, and judgment to canva&s;s all that is &s;aid on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. I accept only tho&s;e controverted points immediately relating to practice, of which you &s;hall not be ignorant, and concerning which you mu&s;t be determined.</P>
<P>BOOKS of practical divinity &s;hould chiefly take up your attention, which teach you how to demean your&s;elves towards God and man, and which in|&s;truct, a&s;&s;i&s;t and excite you to the performance of your duty as Chri&s;tians. Among the&s;e I would heartily recommend to you the writings of Baxter, Doddridge and Watts, which &s;eem to me to breathe the true &s;pirit of primitive Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>BUT after all, the holy bible mu&s;t be your prin|cipal book of devotion. Other books may po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;lead you, as all unin&s;pired writers are infallible.&mdash; The bible is, by way of eminence, the book of knowledge. It is able to in&s;truct you to the be&s;t purpo&s;es. Be obedient therefore to your Saviour's command, who bids you <Q>&s;earch the &s;criptures daily.</Q> If you neglect it, you will be inexcu&s;ably
<PB N="86" REF="013238_0088_0F9044AA6C339510">guilty. God has been at great expen&s;e, if I may &s;peak &s;o, to give and confirm to you the holy &s;crip|tures. Will you then be &s;o ingrateful, as not to &s;tudy them diligently? Unle&s;s St. Paul was mi&s;|taken, <Q>they are able to make you wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation, through faith in Chri&s;t.</Q> They &s;hew you how you may obtain everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; &s;o that I may &s;ay, God is infinitely merciful in giving them to you, and they are of inconceivably great impor|tance to you. How unwi&s;e for your&s;elves will you be, if you will not carefully peru&s;e the &s;acred vo|lume? The bible will be lo&s;t upon you, if you neglect the peru&s;al of it: for what good can it do you, until you find out what it contains? And how can you be acquainted with the contents of it, with|out frequent reading it. Your attendance on the preaching of the word, and your &s;piritual conver|&s;ation with Chri&s;tians, will not be enough to make you knowing in the &s;criptures, unle&s;s reading be added. All the&s;e ways are no more than is nece&s;|&s;ary. Let no day then pa&s;s over you, without your &s;eriou&s;ly and carefully reading &s;ome portion of God's word, with a view to the benefit of your precious &s;ouls.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;o much contained in the bible, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give it your attention, for a long time, before you can be &s;ufficiently acquainted with it. You can hardly be expected to be <Q>mighty in the &s;criptures,</Q> in your youth; but you may be like Timothy, who <Q>from a child knew the holy &s;criptures.</Q> Though you cannot be expected to be thoroughly acquainted with the &s;acred writ|ings,
<PB N="87" REF="013238_0089_0F9044AACCEDFB78">while you are very young, yet you may know as much of them as is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;alvation.</P>
<P>AND now is the time that you ought, above all others, to abound in this &s;tudy. The knowledge of your duty mu&s;t be prior to the practice of it; for you cannot change the natural order of things. How can you know in what manner to employ your&s;elves in God's &s;ervice, before you have learned from his word what it is that he requires of you? You are not to expect you &s;hall be immediately in|&s;pired with religious knowledge, without any care or labour of your own. If God had de&s;igned to do this for you, he never would have in&s;pired holy men to write his will in the &s;acred oracles. It is in the u&s;e of the &s;criptures that you are to look for &s;upernatural illumination.</P>
<P>BESIDES, youth is the happie&s;t and be&s;t time to &s;tore your minds with all &s;orts of u&s;eful knowledge. More e&s;pecially with religious knowledge, which mu&s;t by no means be delayed; becau&s;e you know not how &s;hort your time is. Your memories are more tenacious now, than they will be when you are advanced in years; and your minds are le&s;s taken up with the cares of the world, than it is pro|bable they will be, in the future &s;tages of your lives. Upon the&s;e accounts, you have now the happie&s;t opportunity that ever you are likely to have, to pu&s;h your enquiries in religious matters.</P>
<P>BE per&s;uaded then to be con&s;tant and zealous in the &s;tudy of your bibles. Attend to the &s;en&s;e of what you read, as if it were for your life. It is
<PB N="88" REF="013238_0090_0F9044AB9BEB3398">more than for your life; it is for the life of your pre|cious &s;ouls. Your daily bread is not of half the im|portance to you, that it is to have your &s;ouls <Q>nou|ri&s;hed up,</Q> as the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, <Q>in the words of faith and good doctrine.</Q></P>
<P N="8">VIII. YOU mu&s;t be moderate, and bounded by religion, in your recreations.</P>
<P>IF you are not &s;o, you will not appear to be &s;o|ber-minded. And to be much addicted to plea&s;ur|ing; and to fill up your lives with &s;porting and gaiety, &s;eems to be as diametrically contrary to &s;o|briety as any thing can be.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome kinds of pa&s;time and recreati|on in u&s;e, which as Chri&s;tians, and indeed as rea|&s;onable creatures, you ought wholly to avoid. Such as are hurtful or dangerous to life, limbs, or health; and &s;uch as are di&s;gu&s;tful to the religious and de|vout: together with &s;uch, the lawfulne&s;s of which appears to be doubtful, you &s;hould keep your&s;elves from intirely. You had better appear &s;ingular, and incur the reproaches and emnity of the gay part of the world, than u&s;e tho&s;e recreations which will be apt to offend weak con&s;ciences; or give good men an ill opinion of you; or lay a foundation for doubt|ing in your own hands, whether you have been do|ing what God approves.</P>
<P>As to what is called gaming, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your &s;hunning it, in every kind and degree. For I cannot think it is agreeable to the mind of God, that men &s;hould &s;o trifle with the &s;ub&s;tance which he has given them, and intru&s;ted them with as his &s;tewards, to do good withal, as to ri&s;k it, or any
<PB N="89" REF="013238_0091_0F9044AC48DEFF00">part of it, in a meer bet, or game. The time that is thrown away; the unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions that are often, and almo&s;t unavoidably excited by gaming, and other evils attending it, if duly con&s;idered by you, will be enough to convince you of the unlawful|ne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>SOME game&s;ters comfort them&s;elves, that tho' deep gaming is unju&s;tifiable, they never &s;take more than a trifle. But if this diver&s;ion is &s;inful in kind, as appears evident from what has been already hinted; it will follow, that it is as really wrong to play for &s;hillings and &s;ix-pences as for farms and hou&s;es. For both are trifling with the &s;ub&s;tance which God has given us, and both may be likely to excite unea&s;y, wicked and dangerous fermentations of the &s;pirits. Though the one is more wrong than the other, both are really &s;o; and the lowe&s;t degree of gaming tends to lead men on to the highe&s;t. If we once begin the practice, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to know where we &s;hall end.</P>
<P>I HAVE not been warning you, my young friends, again&s;t this kind of diver&s;ion, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e you to be much guilty of it. I am thankful I know of none of you who are addicted hereunto; and I hope once warning will be &s;ufficient to guard you again&s;t all the temptations and enticements to gaming, that you may meet with hereafter.</P>
<P>THERE is a plenty of other recreations for you, which are confe&s;&s;edly harmle&s;s: and far be it from me to debar you, if I could, from all of every kind. But even in the mo&s;t innocent, you mu&s;t be cau|tioned again&s;t exce&s;s; becau&s;e in the mo&s;t innocent
<PB N="90" REF="013238_0092_0F9044AD2549B720">exce&s;s is criminal. Your recreations will be ex|ce&s;&s;ive, when you &s;pend too much precious time in them; when they indi&s;po&s;e you for the duties of religion; when they are &s;o expen&s;ive, as per&s;ons of your &s;tation cannot well afford; when they di&s;able you to pay your ju&s;t debts, and hinder your doing good to the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and when they engage too much of your attention and zeal, and keep out good meditations. They will al&s;o be exce&s;&s;ive, if you u&s;e them any farther than is bene|ficial to refre&s;h and invigorate your powers, and fit you to do the mo&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice for God and your generation. If you pretend to be &s;erious Chri&s;tians, you mu&s;t <Q>rejoice as though you re|joiced not;</Q> be very moderate in your diver&s;ions; not abounding much in them, nor &s;etting your hearts upon them; but making them &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of God, and your own mo&s;t important intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THAT you may per&s;uade your&s;elves to u&s;e a rea|&s;onable moderation in your recreations, you &s;hould con&s;ider, that you mu&s;t &s;hortly give an account, at the bar of Chri&s;t, how you have &s;pent every hour of your time; what unlawful recreations you have u&s;ed, and how you have exceeded your limits in all the re&s;t. Tho&s;e words of in&s;piration &s;hould be al|ways fre&s;h in your memories, to regulate your con|duct in the&s;e re&s;pects; <Q>rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all the&s;e things God will bring thee into judgment.</Q> You &s;hould indulge to plea&s;ure no
<PB N="91" REF="013238_0093_0F9044ADC7F7A088">farther, than your con&s;ciences tell you that you &s;hall be able to ju&s;tify, at the tribunal of God.&mdash;God allows you to rejoice and be cheerful, in the enjoy|ment of worldly good things. He allows young men, who&s;e volatile minds cannot bear too long and clo&s;e an attention to &s;evere duties and labours, a variety of plea&s;ures &s;uited to their various ta&s;tes; and in the&s;e they may indulge them&s;elves, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of religion, and with that awful &s;crutiny which &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed upon all their actions, in the approaching day of judgment. But farther than this they are not permitted to go.&mdash;Be careful, then, O young men, to take your plea&s;ure no farther than con&s;i&s;ts with the &s;tricte&s;t regard to religion, and with an affecting view of the &s;olem|nity of future and eternal things. If you do this, I am &s;ure you will be very &s;paring and moderate in your recreations. You will not, like too many of your &s;tanding, live a life of plea&s;uring and di&s;&s;ipa|tion; but your chief amu&s;ements will be to go from one work and duty to another.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I WOULD earne&s;tly exhort you to &s;anctify the Chri&s;tian Sabbath.</P>
<P>IT is very ob&s;ervable, that wherever the Lord's day is not &s;trictly ob&s;erved, religion declines, and wick|edne&s;s gains ground. And where will you find a very &s;ober-minded per&s;on, who allows him&s;elf in profaning this day? Or where will you find one of a contrary character, that pays any great regard to this holy time?</P>
<P>I DO not mean to in&s;inuate that you ought to be tied up to Jewi&s;h &s;trictne&s;s, in the ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="92" REF="013238_0094_0F9044AE98734318">the&s;e days: among which people God made it a crime, puni&s;hable with death, to do &s;ome things on the Sabbath, which we call works of nece&s;&s;ity; &s;uch as picking up &s;ticks to kindle a fire, and the like. The Jewi&s;h &s;eventh-day Sabbath is aboli&s;hed, and the Chri&s;tian fir&s;t-day Sabbath introduced in its &s;tead, by the founders of Chri&s;tianity; who &s;et apart this day of the week, for holy and devout ex|erci&s;es; and by their example, have taught us there|on to exerci&s;e our&s;elves in tho&s;e duties, which are immediately beneficial to our &s;ouls. As the former was to celebrate the creation of the world; &s;o the latter is to celebrate the redemption of mankind, by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a no le&s;s wonderful work of God; a proof of the completion of which was, on this day of the week, exhibited to us in the re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead. So that if it was fit and proper to keep the Jewi&s;h Sabbath holy, there can be no rea&s;on given, why the Chri&s;tian Sabbath &s;hould not be kept holy al&s;o. The apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians were wont to a&s;&s;emble on the fir&s;t day of the week, for religious exerci&s;es.&mdash; It is therefore a day to be &s;o &s;pent in holy exerci&s;es, as is mo&s;t beneficial to us upon &s;piritual accounts.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not therefore allow your&s;elves in any worldly meditations, or di&s;cour&s;e, on this &s;olemn and con&s;ecrated day; unle&s;s it be in ca&s;es of nece&s;|&s;ity and mercy. Much le&s;s is it allowable for you to walk the &s;treets, or vi&s;it your friends for recre|ation, or amu&s;ement. Lea&s;t of all is it lawful to ride in a journey, or to do any other of your ordi|nary work, and worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, in this holy time,
<PB N="93" REF="013238_0095_0F9044AF5100D820">excepting in &s;uch ca&s;es as the before-mentioned.&mdash; Our Lord reminded the Jews, that mercy was be|fore &s;acrifice, when he would abate their &s;everity, and over &s;trict regard to the Sabbath. But where this rule cannot be pertinently applied, you mu&s;t keep your&s;elves from all &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>AND, on the other hand, you mu&s;t fill up the whole time with publick and private exerci&s;es of religion. For though it is a day of re&s;t, it is not a day for idlene&s;s. You are to re&s;t from temporal bu&s;ine&s;s, that you may be employed in &s;piritual. While you are at home, your time &s;hould be taken up with reading, religious meditation and prayer. And while you are at the hou&s;e of God, your whole &s;ouls &s;hould be engaged in the publick exerci&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> devotion. Eccl. v. 1. <Q>Keep thy foot, when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the &s;acrifice of fools.</Q> If you are inattentive, or indevout, you <Q>offer the &s;acri|fice of fools,</Q> that is, "of the wicked," which you have rea&s;on to fear will be <Q>abomination to the Lord.</Q> You mu&s;t neither dare to <Q>for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves;</Q> nor let your hearts wander, like "the eyes of a fool," to <Q>the ends of the earth,</Q> when you are pre&s;ent before the Lord.</P>
<P>IF your friends and neighbours tempt you to profane the Sabbath, and though your &s;eniors and &s;uperiours &s;hould &s;et you the example, dare to be &s;ingular in this re&s;pect. Rather follow apo&s;tolick example, than "follow a multitude to do evil." Keep the laws of the land re&s;pecting the Sabbath, rather than follow a thoughtle&s;s multitude in pro|faning
<PB N="94" REF="013238_0096_0F9044B06DC861F8">it; for you are commanded to <Q>&s;ubmit to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake.</Q> Tread in the &s;teps of your pious ance&s;tors, in keep|ing the Sabbath, and not in tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent apo&s;tatizing generation.</P>
<P>THOUGH it may not be ea&s;y to determine exactly, with what degree of &s;trictne&s;s the Chri&s;tian Sabbath ought to be &s;anctified; it is certain that ordinary labour and recreations are to be laid a&s;ide, and the time employed in religious exerci&s;es; becau&s;e it is a day &s;et apart for the wor&s;hip of God, and the edi|fication of our &s;ouls. It is &s;afer for you to deviate, in this ca&s;e, towards &s;uper&s;tition, than towards li|centiou&s;ne&s;s. For the more &s;trictly you ob&s;erve and keep the day to holy purpo&s;es, the more u&s;eful it will be to you, and the more you will honour God in it. You never knew any upon a death-bed re|pent of keeping the Sabbath too &s;trictly; but many have been heard to lament their profanation of it, and cry out again&s;t them&s;elves, for the mi&s;pen&s;e of holy time.</P>
<P>ALL the truly godly and &s;erious lament to &s;ee how frequently the Lord's day is profaned among us. It lies much with you, my dear young friends, whether this day &s;hall be le&s;s and le&s;s honoured, until it comes to be con&s;idered as common time; or whether the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of it &s;hall be re|vived. Do that which, in your &s;erious moments, you judge to be mo&s;t for the advantage of religion, and the benefit of your own &s;ouls: this is all I a&s;k of you. If you will be per&s;uaded to do this, the Sabbath will be better &s;pent for the future; and with
<PB N="95" REF="013238_0097_0F9044B0EC6E4868">the revival of Sabbath-keeping, you may expect to &s;ee a revival of religion and virtue among us.</P>
<P N="10">X. IF you live wicked and carele&s;s lives, I mu&s;t exhort you forthwith to break off all your &s;ins and vices, and engage in the practice of every duty re|quired of you, from &s;uch motives as you are at pre|&s;ent able to be influenced by.</P>
<P>IT is not doubted but you are able to do this, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of common grace. And though this is not holy, evangelical obedience, it is evident to common &s;en&s;e, that it is greatly preferable to neg|lect of duty and vitiou&s;ne&s;s: and it is one of the means, in the u&s;e of which you may hope to attain to true holine&s;s of heart. Con&s;cience, as well as God's word requires this of you. <Q>Cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well,</Q> I&s;a. i. 16. You &s;hould al|ways remember, it is better to do well, even from the lowe&s;t principles, than to do evil from principles as low. If you do the former you will be le&s;s odious in the &s;ight of God, or more lovely, than if you do the latter. When a young man came to our Saviour, who was able to &s;ay he had kept all the command|ments, though it is certain he was de&s;titute of &s;av|ing grace, it is &s;aid, <Q>Je&s;us beholding him, loved him,</Q> Mark x. 21. Though he could not love him with &s;uch complacency as he had in his true di&s;ciples, yet he loved him more than he did profli|gate &s;inners. In like manner, you may hope God will love you, when he &s;ees you engaged in reform|ing your lives, and keeping his commandments: And you will not then be &s;o far from the kingdom of God, as you are at pre&s;ent. But you mu&s;t take
<PB N="96" REF="013238_0098_0F9044B5D8004598">care, that you mi&s;take not this reformation for a &s;aving change.</P>
<P N="11">XI. BUT if you de&s;ire to be heartily religious, you mu&s;t make a &s;olemn dedication of your&s;elves to God, and lay hold on his covenant. You mu&s;t become his indented &s;ervants, if you mean to be faithful &s;ervants.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t of you were born of profe&s;&s;edly Chri&s;tian parents, which gave you a right to the covenant of grace. You had a federal holine&s;s by your birth, 1 Cor. vii. 14. Accordingly, you were publickly and &s;olemnly devoted to God by bapti&s;m, in your infancy. This lays an obligation upon you to renounce the fle&s;h, the world and the Devil: and you ought early to recognize this obligation, by explicitly and openly devoting your&s;elves to God, and engaging to live as your bapti&s;m obliges you, or as becomes the di&s;ciples of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>CONSIDER how Chri&s;t requires you to "confe&s;s" him "before men;" and how he cautions you not to "deny" him, on pain of exclu&s;ion from heaven, Matth. x. 32, 33. Remember how the churches of Macedonia "gave them&s;elves fir&s;t to the Lord," and then "unto" his people, "by the will of God." Think of St. Paul's words, <Q>with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation.</Q> Con&s;ider the&s;e things, and how all adults were required to profe&s;s their faith in Chri&s;t, before the apo&s;tles would initiate them into the church of Chri&s;t, and you will be convinced that God requires you to make an open profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. The
<PB N="97" REF="013238_0099_0F9044B7C342ABC8">churches of this land have been convinced of it; and their practice is founded upon this conviction.</P>
<P>THIS requi&s;ition is not only &s;criptural, but evi|dently rea&s;onable; for how can you expect that your bapti&s;m will avail to entitle you to the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace, when you was not con|&s;enting to your own bapti&s;m, and will not declare that you take the obligation of it upon your&s;elves. You are to fear that your bapti&s;m will become as no bapti&s;m to you, if you neglect, or refu&s;e to take the bonds of the covenant upon your&s;elves, by your own voluntary act. If no adults are to be admitted into the vi&s;ible church, without an open confe&s;&s;ion, as appears to be the ca&s;e, from the acts of the apo&s;tles; does it not follow, that tho&s;e who are baptized in infancy ought to make this confe&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as they are able to choo&s;e the religion of Chri&s;t, in order to their being con|&s;idered as regular members of his church?</P>
<P>A PUBLICK profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity is not only &s;criptural and rational, but it will be greatly helpful to you, in promoting the intere&s;t of religion in your &s;ouls. When you &s;hall have thus publickly and explicitly bound your&s;elves, it may be expected that you will not dare to <Q>go back, or alter the thing that is gone out of your lips.</Q> It will help you to re&s;i&s;t temptations; for you will be able to &s;ay, when they be&s;et you, how can I comply con&s;i&s;tently with my &s;olemn engagements to God, and to the church? You will al&s;o be more under the watch of your Chri&s;tian neighbours; and this will afford you a farther advantage for holine&s;s of life.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="013238_0100_0F9044B91FC68968">
LET me entreat you, my young friends, as you have any de&s;ire to &s;erve God, thus to give up your|&s;elves to God in covenant, now in your youth; whe|ther you can find in your hearts to come to the Lord's table at pre&s;ent, or not. If you are con|vinced of this duty, comply with it pre&s;ently, or give up your preten&s;ions to holine&s;s. For the ha|bitual neglect of any one known duty will be fatal to your &s;ouls. Either renounce all hopes of advan|tage from your bapti&s;m, or el&s;e own the obligations of the covenant which it &s;eals.</P>
<P>IT may be, that &s;everal of you are now &s;aying within your&s;elves, we would comply with this duty, if it were fa&s;hionable for per&s;ons of our &s;tanding, and if we did not fear we &s;hould be tho't &s;ingular. Is this then your ca&s;e, that you fear men more than God? the wor&s;t &s;ort of men, their bla&s;phemous banter and profane ridicule, more than the wrath of the King of kings? If &s;o, you have need to con|&s;ider what your Saviour and Judge has told you, Matth. viii. 38. <Q>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and &s;in|ful generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of man be a&s;hamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</Q> This threatening &s;hould come with the greater weight upon the pre|&s;ent generation, becau&s;e we can profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, without hazarding our lives, or e&s;tates, or liberties. For if Chri&s;t will reject tho&s;e who did not dare to profe&s;s his name, in a time of per&s;ecution, how much more will he reject tho&s;e who will not do it, when they can with &s;afety? Will you then be able, in the
<PB N="99" REF="013238_0101_0F9044BB385E7B20">day of God, to hold up your heads, and &s;ay, <Q>we would have confe&s;&s;ed thee before men; but we were young and ba&s;hful, and afraid of what the wickede&s;t part of the world might think, or &s;ay of us?</Q> If not, confe&s;s your faith in him now, in the mo&s;t publick and explicit manner, while you have opportunity. The unfa&s;hionablene&s;s of it is no better rea&s;on for your neglecting it, than there being few to be &s;aved is, why you &s;hould refu&s;e to belong to that little flock.</P>
<P>MISTAKE me not here, as though I were urging you to make a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, whether you can do it with &s;incerity, or not. I would not be guilty of per&s;uading you to act &s;uch a piece of hypocri&s;y, as to profe&s;s a religion you have not embraced in your hearts.&mdash;But what I would urge upon you is, to covenant with God fir&s;t in private, and then nextly in publick. Con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly how your duty and intere&s;t oblige you to make a &s;olemn &s;urrender of your&s;elves to God in Chri&s;t. Revolve the&s;e things in your minds, until you find your&s;elves inclined to renounce all your &s;ins, and to enter in earne&s;t, upon a cour&s;e of piety and ho|ly obedience. Then in your clo&s;ets, with all po&s;|&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;olemnity, addre&s;s your&s;elves to God, in &s;ome &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e.&mdash;<Q>I am heartily &s;orry for all the &s;ins I have committed again&s;t thee, my be&s;t friend and benefactor; and for my carele&s;s and wicked neglect of my duty towards thee. Therefore I now devote my&s;elf to thy will and plea&s;ure, in all things. I heartily re&s;olve that I will love thee, and live to thee, by
<PB N="100" REF="013238_0102_0F9044BB6A8CAF58">the help of thy grace, as long as I live in the world. I choo&s;e thee as my eternal portion, and place my happine&s;s in the enjoyment of thee. I tru&s;t in the merits of thy Son for pardon and ac|ceptance with thee. I promi&s;e to walk in all thine ordinances blamele&s;s; and that I will give up my&s;elf henceforth to the guidance of thy ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit; re&s;olving that it &s;hall be my mo&s;t delight|ful work to &s;erve and glorify thee here below; and that it &s;hall be my highe&s;t hope to enjoy thee forever hereafter.</Q>&mdash;When you have thus devoted your&s;elves to God in Chri&s;t, as I hope many of you have done already, you may &s;afely make that public profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian religion, which is required of you.

<P N="12">XII. AND la&s;tly, I mu&s;t add one important piece of advice more to all young men who de&s;ire to be &s;ober-minded: which is, that you forthwith

<P>How do "the ways of Zion mourn," that &s;o few "come to the &s;olemn fea&s;t?" Is it not the &s;hame of a Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, who pretend to be governed by go&s;pel-rules, that by far the greater part of them turn their backs upon this in&s;titution, and neglect &s;o ea&s;y a duty and &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a privilege, as to eat and drink in a devout and thankful remembrance of Chri&s;t? Shall it be &s;aid, that they who are un|der indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to remember the dy|ing love of their Redeemer, &s;eem to choo&s;e to for|get him, by avoiding an action which he has com|manded them to perform, on purpo&s;e to revive and continue the affecting remembrance of him? Shall creatures who owe all they have, are, and hope for to Chri&s;t, refu&s;e to obey a command of his, which is &s;o plain and indi&s;putable?</P>
<P>THE heavie&s;t part of this reproach falls upon you, our dear young men: for you, more generally than any other &s;ort of per&s;ons among us, live in the neg|lect of this duty. What a di&s;grace is it, that not &s;o much as one in ten of you has ever yet obeyed this kind, and rea&s;onable command of your dear Saviour? And how &s;ad a thing is it to con&s;ider, that tho&s;e of you who have any inclination to do it are deterred from it, by the idea of its being an uncommon thing, in per&s;ons of your age?</P>
<P>LET me per&s;uade you to a compliance with this
<PB N="102" REF="013238_0104_0F9044BCD54AA730">duty, and an acceptance of this privilege, by a con|&s;ideration of the great utility of it, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting you to cultivate holine&s;s of life; as it is only in this view that my &s;ubject leads me to con&s;ider it. It is wi&s;ely adapted to beget and promote &s;everal of the mo&s;t important and nece&s;&s;ary graces in you. As you have here the Lord <Q>Je&s;us evidently &s;et forth as crucified</Q> before your eyes; the bread repre|&s;enting his body brui&s;ed and broken, and the wine his blood poured out for your redemption; you mu&s;t be dreadfully &s;tupid, if it does not warm you with love and gratitude towards him. So, if any thing can give you a lively &s;en&s;e of the inexpre&s;&s;ible evil of &s;in, it mu&s;t be to &s;ee, as it were, the Creator of the world enduring the tortures of a mo&s;t cruel execution, to make atonement for it. And, if any thing can make you &s;orry for your own &s;ins, give you an hatred of them, and make you abhor your|&s;elves on account of them, it mu&s;t be the &s;ight you may behold at the celebration of this ordinance.&mdash; Al&s;o, if any thing will induce you to renew your holy re&s;olutions, and put you upon the &s;tricte&s;t watchfulne&s;s again&s;t all manner of temptations, it mu&s;t be, one would think, your partaking of the &s;ymbols of the body and blood of Chri&s;t. If any thing, moreover, will &s;erve to &s;trengthen your faith, it mu&s;t be to have the principal object of it thus made familiar to you, by the help of &s;en&s;ible objects. Upon the&s;e and other accounts, an attendance on this ordinance will, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be greatly helpful to your &s;piritual welfare. And are not the&s;e mo&s;t weighty motives, to per&s;uade you to this duty?</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="013238_0105_0F9044BDA984F7A0">
YOU often &s;ay, and &s;ome of you &s;ay it with too little concern, you are not prepared to come to &s;o &s;olemn an ordinance. If this is true, I mu&s;t tell you that you are certainly unprepared for death, judgment and eternity. And how dare you to live a day longer in &s;uch a condition, when you know not but you drop to-day into everla&s;ting burnings? &mdash;But there is no ab&s;olute need of a full a&s;&s;urance of your good e&s;tate, in order to your &s;afely coming to the Lord's table. Examine your&s;elves whether you live outwardly blamele&s;s and exemplary lives; whether you have gained a competent knowledge of the nature and de&s;ign of this ordinance; and whether you have &s;incerely and without any wilful re&s;erve, devoted your&s;elves to the fear and &s;ervice of God, and have re&s;olved to accept of Chri&s;t, as the prophet, prie&s;t and king of your &s;alvation. If you find that you have done, or do the&s;e things, you may &s;afely approach the holy table; and you &s;hould not dare to &s;tay away any longer. In the u&s;e of this, and other means of grace, you may hope to obtain that a&s;&s;urance, which the be&s;t of you are now ready to complain of.</P>
<P>THUS have I cautioned and directed tho&s;e of our young men who de&s;ire to obtain, and improve in Chri&s;tian &s;obriety, what cour&s;es they mu&s;t take.&mdash; The whole of which amounts to this, that they mu&s;t u&s;e all the means of grace, and &s;eek to God for his ble&s;&s;ing upon them. The&s;e are the only methods pointed out in &s;cripture; and they are &s;o hopeful methods, that men have need of no greater encou|ragement, to put them upon &s;triving after grace, than tho&s;e which God has annexed to them.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="013238_0106_0F9044BE5FA3CAE0">
AND may "the God of all grace" &s;o open the hearts of my young friends, that they may attend diligently to the&s;e "things of their peace."&mdash;Other|wi&s;e even "Paul may plant, and Apollos water" in vain; how much more may I teach and exhort to no purpo&s;e? May he &s;o di&s;po&s;e them to u&s;e the&s;e in&s;trumental duties, or means of holine&s;s; and &s;o follow them with the effectual influences of his &s;pirit, that they may not only obtain the renewal of their minds; but grow and increa&s;e in holine&s;s, until they &s;hall receive the <Q>end of their conver|&s;ation;</Q> even the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls with eternal glory.</P>
