<P>A Fooli&s;h King gra&s;ps at wealth and power, as the ends, a wi&s;e King u&s;es them as the means of government. With the one they are gorgeous, vain appendages of royalty; with the other, they are happy in&s;tru|ments of benevolence. A fooli&s;h King eyes liberty a&s;kaunt, and execrates it as the bane of greatne&s;s; a wi&s;e King knows that neither kingdom nor Sovereign can be great without it. The fool endeavours to root up what the patriot King mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivates. A weak Prince is jealous of liberty in its lowe&s;t branches. Hence it is, that he not only &s;trikes at the rights and privileges of his people, but is mean enough to envy the immunities of a corporation. He &s;tarts at &s;hadows. In &s;uch
<PB N="114" REF="013981_0002_0F92597DAD78DA98">a reign even commercial meetings are odious, becau&s;e they are compo&s;ed of freemen. Even Common-halls are an unlawful Congre&s;s; like that in America, they are deemed rebellious a&s;&s;ociations. How &s;ophi&s;tically do mini|&s;terial &s;cribblers labor to draw an artful veil over &s;uch political tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as Sovereigns without a blu&s;h avow? Can the &s;agacious Doctor John&s;on (that mini&s;terial hackney) any longer rally the well grounded jealou&s;ies of England and America? Can he now a&s;k the&s;e croakers of calamity, how &s;lavery can be brought from America into England? If he dares. I refer him for his an&s;wer to Lord Hert|ford (one of the &s;tate nur&s;erymen) who &s;owed a &s;ubtle feed or two of &s;lavery, even in our metropolis the other day. I hope, however, that the&s;e feeds will be &s;everely choked by the rank and &s;tubborn weed of liberty. A weed it is now deemed in the cabinet, and in the legi&s;lature, and in both condemned to be rooted up. A crop far more promi&s;ing is expected. The experiment of rai&s;ing it by &s;low degrees has ju&s;t been made. His Ma|je&s;ty, &s;ick of all addre&s;&s;es but tho&s;e of his faith|ful Parliament, has ju&s;t declared, "that he will not receive, on the Throne, any addre&s;s remon&s;trance or petition of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the city of London, but in their corporate capacity." Thus is the notice worded by Lord Mansfield, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice (not of the ceremonies) but of England.
<PB N="115" REF="013981_0003_0F92597E4FA6E988">The rea&s;on, or rather the de&s;ign of this is plain. For all acts done in their corporate capa|city, the city of London is re&s;pon&s;ible as a corporation. Neither the proceedings, the re&s;olves, nor the Congre&s;s of a Common|hall, can forfeit the charter of the city; the offences (&s;uch as petitions) of the city, as a corporation, may. In the one ca&s;e they act in their political capacity, in the other they do not. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Liverymen, are individuals, but the Cor|poration has but one neck. This mini&s;terial mou&s;etrap is baited by a Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England, who&s;e duty it mo&s;t clearly is, for I will teach it him, to carry the balance with an even and an equal hand, between the ju&s;t prerogatives of the crown, and the un|doubted privileges of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but a Mansfield and a Thurloe will conduct the intended &s;cheme as well as a Jefferies or a Sawyer. The me|morable ca&s;e of the &s;even Bi&s;hops in James the Second's time, is now forgot at court, and petitions are once more degenerated into crimes.</P>
<P>Though the actual annihilation of the city charter may not be intended, as it cannot be the intere&s;t of the crown to check any &s;ource of wealth, yet the menaces, and intimidating pro&s;ecutions of a rapacious mini&s;try, may be expected to have the &s;ame happy effects as threatening letters &s;ometimes have among
<PB N="116" REF="013981_0004_0F92597F01B79340">thieves. They found it &s;o lately, in the ca&s;e of the Ea&s;t-India Company, and it is not im|probable that their audacity may &s;trengthen with their hopes.</P>
<P>Toys and baubles mu&s;t be bought, and ba|byhou&s;es mu&s;t be crowded to amu&s;e and divert vacant Sovereigns, and ravens mu&s;t have food. The numerous mouths of corruption mu&s;t be &s;topped. Too many &s;tratagems, for the &s;ake of wealth and arbitrary power, cannot be tried. For gold every coffer, for power every vein mu&s;t bleed. The predictions of America, in re&s;pect to England her&s;elf, are now verifying. They are coming forward, by &s;low degrees, at this in&s;tant. Our mini&s;ters of late have had a &s;trange appetite for charters. In Wilkes's ca&s;e they had the daring impudence to attack the great charter of England for the &s;ake of power. They have &s;ince been nibbling at the Ea&s;t-India Company's, for the &s;ake of wealth and power both; the company com|pounded and acquie&s;ced. They are &s;triking again at charters in America (as their retained and pen&s;ioned advocate Dr. John&s;on &s;ays) for the &s;ake of power, and they now have their eye upon the charters of London for a royal rea&s;on,&mdash; for the &s;ake of pur&s;uing the com|mercial intere&s;ts of this kingdom.</P>
<P>But are the petitions of Common-halls, or Common-halls them&s;elves &s;o dreadful? Are the meetings, or more properly the great
<PB N="117" REF="013981_0005_0F92597FF5690110">Councils, of this metropolis &s;o terrible? Are they not the meetings of meritorious citizens and loyal &s;ubjects? In both the&s;e capacities they have addre&s;&s;ed, and in both they have offended.</P>
<P>How har&s;h and grating is the voice of truth! How unhallowed are the lips that dare to utter it before the throne! Approach it, ye Briti&s;h &s;laves, upon the knee; adore it with pro&s;tration, but profane it not with a petition! Upon this mercy &s;eat, alas, the So|vereign will no more receive petitions from his faithful citizens and friends, from tho&s;e who &s;upply his wants, his &s;uperfluities, his extravagancies, and his plenteous coffers. Upon this &s;acred &s;eat he can only li&s;ten to the &s;ycophantic addre&s;&s;es of a corrupt and de|&s;tructive Parliament; tho&s;e leeches of the realm who &s;o largely drain, for their own abandoned u&s;es, tho&s;e coffers which his re|pul&s;ed citizens &s;o largely fill.</P>
<P>How like a God does a Monarch look en|circled by treacherous minions and rapacious flatterers! How like a mere mortal &s;urround|ed by &s;ubjects mo&s;t affectionate and &s;incere, who &s;hower down at once both &s;upplies and ble&s;&s;ings upon a Prince whom they honor, e&s;teem and love!</P>
<P>But Kings &s;hould quit the tract of mortals, they &s;hould di&s;dain the little virtues of hu|manity! The &s;pirit of a Monarch &s;hould a&s;|pire
<PB N="118" REF="013981_0006_0F92598091AD5078">at an excentric character beyond the reach of man. This will nobly lead him not to endure, but to repel the humble &s;uits of his aggrieved &s;ubjects; not to care&s;s, but to dete&s;t his people; not to &s;ooth, conciliate and appea&s;e, but to menace, in&s;ult and exter|minate; not to human errors, but inhuman crimes; not to reformation, but to murder. Not to ju&s;tice, but to tyranny. Not to peace and honor, but to remor&s;e, hatred, calamity, re&s;i&s;tance and the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch Princes, like that unhappy tyrant Charles the Fir&s;t, &s;eek in vain for &s;helter a|mong&s;t the fawning herds that idolize their vices, for the &s;ake of &s;haring their prodiga|lity and profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let them try their faithful Scots, who, as they have often received the wages of cor|ruption, will a &s;econd time receive the price of blood.</P>
<P>Let them fly to the arms of tho&s;e tender tyrants their preceptors, who have thus care|fully trained them to their ignominy and ruin from their cradle.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they repul&s;e a &s;uffering and an in|jured &s;ubject, let them fall, for con&s;olation, upon the friendly bo&s;om of a Mansfield or a Bute.&mdash;Let them, in their frenzy, fly for &s;uc|cour to their Chancellor,&mdash;not a York, alas, but an Ap&s;ley, the poor &s;hadow of a Mansfield! Let them mo&s;t de&s;ervedly ta&s;te all the bitter|ne&s;s of de&s;pair and find relief (though late)
<PB N="119" REF="013981_0007_0F92598606D30648">at la&s;t, in the generous conde&s;cen&s;ion and for|givene&s;s of a de&s;pi&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and oppre&s;&s;ed people.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed then, my Lord Mansfield, not at the humble, ju&s;t petitions, but at the lenity of their patient &s;ubjects, let them deliver up their minions to the block, with &s;hame and contrition re&s;ign the crown, and &s;leep ignobly with their fathers; but let their infamy be recorded, that &s;ucceeding Princes may pro|fit largely from &s;uch weak and guilty annals.</P>
