<P>O<HI>Ur</HI> LORD <HI>in His last and must hea|venly Prayer for His</HI> Disciples, <HI>Has said, that</HI> this is life eternal to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. <HI>I have therefore in the Course of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Mi|ninstry among you (you know) pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ched concerning</HI> Christ <HI>more than on any other Subject.

Yea, the Disbelief of the Mysteryes of the Trinity and the Incarnation of the Son of God, the sole Foundation of the Christian Religion, is so diffused in the world, as that it has al|most devoured the Power and vitals of it.&mdash;Of all the evils which I have seen in the dayes of my pilgimage now drawing to their close, there is none so grievous as the pub|lique Contempt of the principal Mysteries of the Gospel. <HI>Thus</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Owen <HI>of the glory of Christ. p.</HI> 4. 5. &amp; <HI>p.</HI> 87.</NOTE><HI>that excellent man.

is the Son of God,</HI> but not that he is the <HI>eternal</HI> Son of God, (as others were wont to instruct their Children) for he supposed that he was not God's Son before his <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arnation. I did from the</HI> Scriptures <HI>reason with him, and endea|vour'd to</HI> convince <HI>him how</HI> great <HI>an</HI> Error <HI>he was in: He seem'd to receive some Satisfaction, and did with many tears declare unto me, that</HI> he had for some time been afraid lest his Error in Judgment should be <HI>fundamental</HI> and so his soul perish. <HI>I shall conceal the Persons Name; he was not only a</HI> Church-Member, <HI>and an aged Pro|fessor, but of special</HI> Note <HI>and</HI> Improvement <HI>in the Town where he lived.

<P>IT hath been observed by some, That of all the Prophets <HI>Isaiah</HI> is the most Evan|gelical.

<P>DOCT. 3. That <HI>Jesus Christ by His death hath merited the Conversion and Salvation of his Elect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 1. That there is a Covenant of Re|demption.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000416_0012_0FA5A9CC2E41D3D0">We have formerly spoken of the Covenant of <HI>Grace</HI> made with Believers.

<P>Propos. 1. <HI>There have been eternal Foede|ral Transactions between God the Father and the Son concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he</HI> Redemption <HI>of the Elect.</HI> This Proposition is expressive of the Nature

of the Covenant of Redemption, shewing what it is.</P>
<P>And there are <HI>three</HI> things contained there|in. 1. That there hath been a Transaction between the Father and the Son concerning the Redemption of the Elect. 2. That this Transaction was from Eternity. 3. That it is Foederal.</P>
<P N="1">1. There hath bin a Transaction between the Father and the Son concerning the Redemption of the Elect. It is true, that there were Transactions and Consultations concer|ning Mankind, before Man was made. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 26. <HI>God said, let us make man in our I|mage after our likeness.</HI> Who are the Per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ns here spoken of, as creating Man? Even the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI> For none but the LORD alone <HI>did</HI> or <HI>could</HI> Create man. So then the Sacred Trinity did as it were <HI>sit in council</HI> concerning the Creation of Man, but besides that, There have been glorious Transactions between the Father and the Son concerning the work of Redemption. Thus some interpret that Scripture in <HI>Zech.</HI> 6. 13. <HI>The counsel of peace shall be between them both.</HI> h. e. between the <HI>LORD JEHOVAH,</HI> and Him that is called <HI>the BRANCH:</HI> God and Christ did (as it were) consult together

<P N="2">2. This Transaction was from <HI>Eternity.</HI> For God from Eternity knew that Man would fall, and though it be true, that neither the <HI>Di|vine Pras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ence,</HI> nor any thing else <HI>is</HI> or <HI>can</HI> be a Cause of GOD's Will (which is Himself) either <HI>Electing</HI> or <HI>Reprobating,</HI> ne|vertheless, we may from that Consideration argue and conclude, that He did from E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er|nity contrive a way for man's Recovery. It is true, that the Revelation of this Contriv|anc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was not before Time: it was first dis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ered presently after the Fall, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 15. and it was not put in Execution untill the <HI>Fulness of time</HI> came (<HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 4.) that is to say, when the Son of God became incarnate; Nevertheless, the thing was agreed upon, by the Father and the Son, before the world be|gan, we may see by those Scriptures, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR> 2. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im.</HI> 1. 9. &amp; <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 2.</P>

Thus the Father and the Son are two distinct Persons, although essentially One, yet personally Two. Again, Covenants are <HI>voluntary</HI> Transactions; so it is here, God the Father was voluntary therein, for He might have chose whether He would have accepted of satisfaction for sin from any but the Sinner himself. It was not any necessity of nature, but an Act of His ho|ly Will and Pleasure, to propound terms of Reconciliation. The <HI>Son</HI> was likewise vo|luntary in this matter; for He might have refused to have <HI>accepted</HI> of the Terms of this Covenant, but it pleased Him to accept there|of. Moreover, where there are Terms and Articles of Agreement accepted of, on both parts, there is a proper Covenant: So it is here (as afterwards will appear.)

These Solemn Provi|dences were so convictive as that the <HI>Cap|tain</HI> who commanded the Souldiers the day that Christ was crucified, cryed out, <HI>Truly, this was the</HI> Son of GOD. Oh the <HI>Jews</HI> have killed the <HI>Son of God.</HI> Mat. 27. 45,&mdash;51, 52, 54,</P>

<P>Let me conclude this Doctrine with a word of <HI>Exhortation.</HI> And there is a <HI>three-fold</HI> Ex|hortation before us,</P>
<P N="1">1. To endeavour after Knowledge &amp; good Understanding in this glorious Mystery, con|cerning the <HI>Sonship of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>believe</HI> this Truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. To <HI>Practise accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Exhort. 1. <HI>Endeavour we after</HI> Knowledge <HI>and</HI> good Understanding <HI>in this glorious Myst|ery.</HI> Therefore,</P>
<P>Consider. 1. <HI>That there are but</HI> few <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have this Knowledge.</HI> At leastwise not in that degree and measure which ought to be; yea &amp; which <HI>might</HI> be, considering the means which are plentifully afforded. As the Apostle speak|eth
<PB N="38" REF="000416_0046_0FA5B5A91B43B4B0">
speakes to the Hebrewes, <HI>When for the time you ought to be Teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God.</HI> Cap. 5. 12. It is marvellous to con|sider what Ignorance is in many that call themselves Christians. As an holy man once complained, (not without too much Cause) that <HI>Christ is but little known amongst Christians.</HI> Yea, some that are very knowing in <HI>other</HI> mat|ters of Religion, yet if they be examined a|bout <HI>Christ,</HI> they are found exceeding igno|rant.</P>
<P>Consid. 2. <HI>The surpassing Excellency of this Knowledge.</HI> Hence the Apostle saith, Yea doubtless I count all things but loss, for the <HI>Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</HI> Phil. 3. 8. Knowledge is an excel|lent and desireable thing. Knowledge of the <HI>Creature</HI> is so; which caused <HI>Solomon</HI> to say, that Wisdom excels Folly, as far as Light ex|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ls Darkness. Much more is the Knowledg of <HI>Christ</HI> excellent and desirable, whereby all other Knowledge is <HI>sanctified,</HI> and without <HI>which</HI> all other Knowledge will never save a man's soul. Hence the holy Prophets of old were very diligent in end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avouring after this Knowledge; as we see 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10, 11. <HI>of which salvation the</HI> prophets <HI>have enquired, and

searched</HI> diligently, <HI>searching what, or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie, when it testifyed before hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should be revealed.</HI> Nay the blessed <HI>Angels</HI> admire and seek after this Knowledge. The things of Christ are <HI>things which the</HI> Angels <HI>desire to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook into.</HI> And if <HI>Prophets,</HI> if <HI>Angels</HI> have desired to search into the Mystery of the In|carnation of the Son of God, much more in|to that of His eternal <HI>Generation.</HI> The truth is, that this Knowledge is not had but by Divine Revelation. Christ is not known by the Light of Nature, but by the special Re|velation of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> held forth in the Gospel. Wherefore the Apostle saith, <HI>It pleased God to reveal his son in me.</HI> Gal. 1. 15. And when <HI>Peter</HI> made that glorious Con|fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion, <HI>Thou art Christ, the</HI> Son <HI>of the living</HI> GOD, it was said unto him, <HI>Flesh and bloud hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Mat. 16. 16, 17. Hence the whole Doctrine concerning Christ is called a <HI>Mystery,</HI> Eph. 3. 4. <HI>Ye may understand my knowledge in the</HI> Mystery <HI>of Christ.</HI> A M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ste|ry is a Divine <HI>Secret</HI> which is not known but by Revelation: So is the Truth concerning <HI>Christ.</HI> And as all Truths which reveal Christ

are excellent; so there is a <HI>special</HI> Excellen|cy in those which concern the <HI>Person</HI> of Christ.</P>

So the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> they had great know|ledge in the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Scripture, and yet because they knew not <HI>Christ</HI> they perished to Eternity.

<P>By way of <HI>Direction</HI> here observe these Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we would have a right understanding in those Truths which concern the Person of Christ the Son of God, We must <HI>Attend the Mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s which the Lord hath appointed in order to the attaining that Knowledge.</HI> e. g. Searching the blessed <HI>Scriptures:</HI> therefore Christ said, <HI>Search the</HI> Scriptures <HI>for</HI> they <HI>testify of me.</HI> Joh.
<PB N="43" REF="000416_0051_0FA5B5ADC184E2B0">
5. 39. And <HI>Solomon</HI> sheweth, that the way to know Wisdome is to seek and search after it, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 4. h. e. We must <HI>digg</HI> and <HI>dive</HI> into the rich Mines of Scripture. In things of this nature, we must take heed of our own Conceits, but be sure to keep close to the Scriptures. And Attendance to the Word preached is also the way to gain and grow in the Knowledge of Christ. For it is the great work of the Ministry to preach Christ, to op|en the Mysteryes of Christ. We read in <HI>Gen.</HI> 29. 3. How the Shepherds rolled the Stone from the Wells mouth, and watered the Sheep; So Ministers are to open the My|steries of Christ and Salvation by Him. The Lord doth bestow gifts of Knowledge upon <HI>some</HI> above others for this end in special, that so they might be fitted for the work of the Ministry and might bring to the Knowledge of the Son of God, <HI>Eph.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 13. Prayer also is a meanes to attain this knowledge: <HI>If thou</HI> criest <HI>after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding, then shalt thou find the knowledge of God,</HI> Prov. 2. 3, 5. We should pray for the illumination of the Spirit, and the rather because the Lord Jesus hath pro|mised to send His Spirit to guide us into all Truth, Joh. 16. 13. Let us be earnest in
<PB N="44" REF="000416_0052_0FA5B5AE494AB538">
Prayer that we may receive that Unction from the Holy One that shall make us know all things, that are necessary to be known in or|der to our Salvation and Consolation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Beware of Presumption &amp; Curiosity.</HI> We must not be wise above what is written. It is good to enquire into these divine and holy Mysteries, so far as God hath <HI>revealed,</HI> but no further: If we do, not <HI>Knowledge</HI> but <HI>Blind|ness</HI> will be the effect of those Enquiries. A Vehement Object we say destroyeth the sense: If men come too near the Sun, their eyes are dazled that they cannot see. A <HI>Moth</HI> by a|proaching too near the Light destroyeth it self; so many a proud Presumer by too bold prying into these glorious Mysteryes hath de|stroyed his own soul.</P>
<P>Exhort. 2. <HI>Believe this Truth, that</HI> Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD. It is not so easy a matter to believe this as many think for <HI>Reason</HI> cannot comprehend this Mystery, and <HI>thence</HI> it is not ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> after a right manner, with the heart to believe it. Yet It is necessary to be believed, as being a fundamental Princi|ple in Religion. Therefore when <HI>Peter</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Disciples professed that <HI>Christ is
<PB N="45" REF="000416_0053_0FA5B5B1E167A6A8">
the Son of God,</HI> the Lord replyed, <HI>upon this rock I will build my Church,</HI> Mat. 16. 18. so then they that believe not this, do not belong to Christ, nor to the Church of Christ. All Re|ligion, yea <HI>whole Christianity</HI> would fall to the ground if <HI>this</HI> Principle should be plucked up. The Summe of the Gospel is contained in this great Truth. Hence <HI>Paul's</HI> Preaching is summarily expressed by saying, <HI>He preached Christ that He is the Son of God.</HI> Act. 9. 20. There are many Truths of lesser Concern, which through Ignorance may be disbelieved or denyed, and yet a mans Salvation not haz|zarded thereby: But it is not so as to <HI>this</HI> Truth respecting the Sonship of Jesus Christ; whosoever disowneth <HI>it,</HI> will miss of eternal Salvation, 1. Joh. 2. 23. <HI>Whosoever denieth the</HI> Son, <HI>the same hath not the Father.</HI> Hence Satan hath made it his great design to oppose this Truth. The Devil said to Christ, (<HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 3.) IF <HI>thou be the son of God.</HI> The wicked Devil would feign have that questioned. Wherefore in the dayes of the Apostles, he stirred up <HI>Ebion</HI> and <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> and other He|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eticks who denyed the <HI>Deity,</HI> and so the <HI>eter|nal Sonship</HI> of Christ, which is thought to be the occasion of <HI>John's</HI> writing his <HI>Gospel</HI> where|in he doth most plainly and abundantly assert
<PB N="46" REF="000416_0054_0FA5B5B213ED8448">
the Godhead of Christ. Afterwards, Satan stirred up <HI>Arius,</HI> who maintained that Christ was only a <HI>Creature</HI> and not the eternally be|gotten Son of the Father; and the Church was in danger of being carried away with that flood of <HI>Arian Heresy</HI> which over-whelmed the world Rev. 12. 15. <HI>The whole christian world</HI> (as one of the Ancients speaketh) <HI>sigh|ed and wondered to see it self become an</HI> Arian. Thus we see Satan layeth Battery against this Truth, because he knowes the souls and Sal|vation of men are concern'd in the Belief of it. Therefore let us firmly believe it.</P>
<P>By way of Direction, here remember these two Rules.</P>
<P N="1">1. We must set this down for a <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>we are to believe beyond Reason.</HI> Albeit the great Truths of the Christian Religion are not contrary <HI>unto,</HI> yet they are <HI>above</HI> Reason. Therefore must we believe what we are not a|ble to comprehend. <HI>Pagans</HI> of old, were wont scoffingly to call the Christians <HI>Credentes,</HI> that is <HI>believing</HI> persons, because they were such as would believe beyond the comprehension of <HI>Reason.</HI> And one reason why <HI>Socinians</HI> in these late dayes have had such gross and dam|nable mistakes about the <HI>Person of Christ,</HI> hath been because they would not believe beyond
<PB N="47" REF="000416_0055_0FA5B5B3A079FED0">
Reason; whenas the great and glorious My|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eries respecting the Son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hip and the eter|nal Generation of Christ's Person are be|yond what any mans Reason can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">athom&punc; Therefore we must set Faith on work, and though we cannot conceive how <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> should be, yet we are to take Divine Testi|mony for it. Take the Word of God for it that it is so, and there rest satisfied.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us not content our selves with a meer</HI> notional <HI>Belief about this matter; but see that our Faith be sincere and cordial.</HI> Let us see that this Truth be not only in our heads but in our hearts also. If men have only a notional Belief concerning this, that's no more than what the Devils have. Jam. 2. 19. <HI>Thou believest that there is one God, thou dost well, the</HI> Devils <HI>also believe and tremble.</HI> So do the Devils believe, that JESUS is the SON of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and tremble at the Apprehension of His Infinite MAJESTY. A whole Legion of Devils fell a roaring at the presence of the Lord Jesus, Crying, <HI>Jesus, thou Son of God, art thou come to torment us before the time?</HI> Mat. 8. 29.
<PB N="48" REF="000416_0056_0FA5B5B464554500">
But hearty Belief <HI>of,</HI> and Closure <HI>with</HI> this Truth is another thing. <HI>Philip</HI> said, <HI>If thou believest with all thine heart,</HI> unto him that pro|fessed, <HI>I believe that</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>is the Son of God Act.</HI> 8. 37. That's necessary in order to Sal|vation: <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 18. <HI>With the heart man be|leeveth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto</HI> SALVATION. When a man doth <HI>so</HI> believe this Truth, as that he could gladly lay down his life for Con|fessing and Bearing witness to it, that's hearty Believing. As in the primitive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it was as much as a man's Life was wort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Confess this Truth. The Infidel <HI>Jews</HI> and Heathen of those dayes would be ready to kill any one that should profess such a Belief. In which respect the Apostle might well say as the 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 15. <HI>Whosoever confesseth that</HI> Jesus Christ is the SON of God, <HI>God is in him, and he in God.</HI> This is to be understood, not of a meer <HI>notional</HI> but of a <HI>cordial,</HI> yea and a <HI>Practical</HI> Believing.</P>
<P>We proceed therefore to</P>
<P>Exhor. 3. <HI>Practise according to this Truth.</HI> Let every one look to it, that they carry towards Christ as becometh towards the Son of God.</P>

<P>Answ. 1. <HI>Attend to whatever He shall say.</HI> That may be the special Reason why Christ in the Preface of his Epistle to the Church in <HI>Thyatira,</HI> mentions His being the Son of God, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that so He might stirr up <HI>Attention.</HI> And if Christ hath any thing to say to us, we may be sure that it is well worth the hearkning to, because He is the Son of God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 6, 7, <HI>Hear, for I will speak of</HI> excellent <HI>things, and the opening of my mouth shall be right things, for my mouth shall speak the Truth.</HI> O then hearken to the Son of God!

<P N="3">3. Honour <HI>Jesus Christ the Son of GOD.</HI> When God sent His Son into the world, He said, <HI>They will</HI> reverence <HI>my Son,</HI> Matth. 21. 37. Sure it is, that upon <HI>that</HI> account <HI>Re|verence</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> is due unto Him.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Apostle having in the preceding Chapters of this Epistle, handled the Doctrine of Justification, he proceeds in this (with several other Chapters following) to discourse concerning the Mystery of <HI>Pre|destination.</HI> He had before asserted, that the Elect of God could not perish; against which Assertion it might have been objected, That the <HI>Jews</HI> who were an elect Nation perish in their Infidelity: To this he Answers, That not <HI>Elect</HI> but <HI>Reprobate</HI> (whether amongst
<PB N="56" REF="000416_0063_0FA5B5BDEADFE038">
Jews or Gentiles) are the persons that shall fall short of Salvation.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Chapter, <HI>Paul</HI> ex|presseth his exceeding great Sorrow, for the Unbelief of the Jews, and for their being thereupon rejected of God: And he mentions several things which were the springs and Ag|gravations of his sorrow. One thing that made him grieve the more, was, In that the Jews were his <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Kinsmen,</HI> and therefore their misery could not but go the more near to his heart. Another thing which aggrava|ted his grief, was, the Consideration of those peculiar Priviledges and Glories which are to be affirmed of the Jewish Nation. Two of which are mentioned in this verse:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Theirs are the Fathers.</HI> h. e. They were descended from those blessed Patriarchs, <HI>Abra|ham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob.</HI> Now it is a very sad thing to consider, that the Children and Post|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rity of those blessed Ancestors, should become the subjects of so great Misery and Ruin as is now come upon the Jews.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Of them, as concerning the flesh, Christ came.</HI> Christ was as to His humane nature an <HI>Israel|ite:</HI> which is the greatest glory the Jewish Nation can speak of; and therefore that's
<PB N="57" REF="000416_0064_0FA5B5BE1B374900">
mentioned in the last place. Christ came of them only in respect of <HI>His flesh,</HI> i. e. His body or human Nature. He has another Na|ture which did not come of them, but is eter|nal.</P>
<P>Words cannot be expressed which do more clearly and fully declare the God head of Christ than these do. And therefore let the Doctrine from them be in the words of the Apostle,</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> That <HI>Jesus Christ is over all, GOD blessed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>It will be good for us to be <HI>established</HI> in this great Truth, the firm Belief whereof is neces|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ary in order to Salvation.

<P N="1">1. <HI>The</HI> Names <HI>and</HI> Titles <HI>which are peculiar unto</HI> God, <HI>are in the Scripture given to Jesus Christ.</HI> e. g. He is expresly and frequently called <HI>GOD,</HI> and that not only in the <HI>New Testament</HI> but in the <HI>Old.</HI> It is said that <HI>the Angel spake unto</HI> Jacob, <HI>saying, I am the</HI> God <HI>of Bethel,</HI> Gen. 31. 11, 13. Now God the
<PB N="58" REF="000416_0065_0FA5B5BED37650A8">
<HI>Father</HI> is no where styled an Angel, wherefore that Angel who is the <HI>God of Bethel</HI> was none else but <HI>Christ</HI> the increated Angel of the ever|lasting Covenant. Again, when <HI>Jacob</HI> blessed <HI>Joseph'</HI>s Children, he thus expressed himself, <HI>God before whom my fathers</HI> Abraham <HI>and</HI> Isa|ac <HI>did walk, the God which led me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which Redeemed me from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, bless the lads,</HI> Gen. 48. 15. 16. This Angel is called <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> which is God's Title, <HI>Isa.</HI> 47. 4. The words cannot be applyed unto any <HI>created</HI> Angel, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acob prayeth for a blessing from Him, as the Authour of Redemption from all Evil. This then clearly proves that Christ is <HI>God,</HI> and that <HI>Jacob</HI> did so believe.

styled John the <HI>Divine.</HI> And that is in a special manner the Scope of this Chapter, which does contain a Description of the <HI>Per|son of Jesus Christ,</HI> in respect of <HI>both</HI> his Natures <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Humane.</HI> The <HI>Divini|ty</HI> of Christ is asserted and proved from <HI>ver.</HI> 1. to 14.

<P N="1">1. The Person <HI>Assuming,</HI> called the <HI>Word.</HI> h. e. the Son of God, or second Person in the Trinity, who is called <HI>the Word.</HI> In the <HI>Old-Testament</HI> Christ is called the word When <HI>David</HI> said before God, <HI>For thy</HI> Words <HI>sake thou hast done all these great things.</HI> 2. Sam. 7. 21. his meaning may be, that all was done for the sake of <HI>Christ.</HI> And the Jews of Old were wont to term the <HI>Messiah</HI> the <HI>Word of God.</HI> So the <HI>Chaldee Paraphrase</HI> frequently calleth the <HI>Messiah</HI> [MIDBAR] i. e. <HI>the Word.</HI> Now the <HI>Messiah</HI> being commonly styled the <HI>Word</HI> of God, the Apostle speaking of him giveth him that Name.

The <HI>Patriachs</HI> of old did long for nothing so much as the fulfilling of that <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>Promise,</HI> that the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come into the world and redeem his people.

Flesh. It is not only the Word <HI>was</HI> Flesh but that he was <HI>made</HI> so. <HI>[Egeneto]</HI> i. e. he took the Nature into personal Union with himself.

<P>Accordingly there are two <HI>Doctrines</HI> to be insisted on.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. That <HI>Jesus Christ the Son of God is</HI> man <HI>as well as God.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. II. That <HI>There is a</HI> personal Uni|on <HI>between the two natures of Christ.</HI></P>

<P>In the doctrinal handling of this great Truth, <HI>two</HI> things may be enquired into. (1) How it does appear that the Son of God became <HI>Man.</HI> (2) The Reason why he did so.</P>
<P>QUEST. I. <HI>How does it appear that the Son of God is</HI> Man, <HI>and not God</HI> only?</P>
<P>ANSW. 1. <HI>The</HI> Scripture <HI>does expresly and abundantly bear witness to this Truth.</HI> Christ is
<PB N="79" REF="000416_0086_0FA5B5D2B6A4FF98">
expresly called <HI>the MAN Christ Jesus,</HI> 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. He said to to the Jews, <HI>ye seek to kill a</HI> Man <HI>that</HI> has <HI>told you the truth.</HI> Joh. 8. 40. And he is styled <HI>the Son of</HI> Man. <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 13. He is set forth by that Name about fourty times in the <HI>New-Testament.</HI> And he is said to be the son of <HI>David,</HI> Mat. 1. 1. And the son of the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> Christ as <HI>God</HI> had no Mother. As <HI>man</HI> He was without <HI>Fatuher,</HI> as <HI>God</HI> without <HI>Mother.</HI> Inasmuch therefore, as the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> is said to be his <HI>mother,</HI> he is <HI>man</HI> as well as God. And the Scripture saith that he was born of a <HI>woman</HI> Gal. 4. 4. And he is called the <HI>seed</HI> of the <HI>Woman,</HI> Gen. 3. 15, And he is called by the name of <HI>Adam:</HI> He is the <HI>last Adam,</HI> 1. Cor. 15. 45. And it is said, <HI>the second</HI> Man <HI>was the Lord from Heaven,</HI> ver. 47. Therefore he is as truly <HI>man</HI> as the <HI>first</HI> Adam was. The Scriptures affirm of him, that He became <HI>Flesh.</HI> Without Controversy, <HI>great</HI> is the <HI>mystery</HI> of Godliness, <HI>God manifest in the flesh,</HI> 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16. Christ is God <HI>incornate.</HI> When the eternal Son of God did assume the hu|mane nature, then was God manifest in the flesh.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The</HI> Essential <HI>parts of a</HI> man <HI>are affirmed of Christ, therefore it is most true that he hath an</HI> humane <HI>nature belonging to Him. A</HI> man does consist of two essential parts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> An
<PB N="80" REF="000416_0087_0FA5B5D34DD7D6A8">
<HI>humane Body,</HI> and <HI>a rational Soul;</HI> both which do belong to Christ. <HI>He</HI> has an humane Bo|dy; <HI>We are sanctified by the offering of the</HI> Bo|dy <HI>of Jesus Christ,</HI> Heb. 10. 10. <HI>His own self bare our sins in his</HI> own body <HI>on the tree,</HI> 1. Pet. 2. 24. When Christ had blessed the bread at the Lords Supper, He brake it and said this is my <HI>Body,</HI> Mat. 26. 26. The <HI>Members</HI> of an humane Body belong to him, Hence we read of His <HI>Eyes,</HI> Joh. 17. 1. And of his <HI>Hands</HI> and his <HI>Feet,</HI> Psal. 22. 16. And that too after his Resurrection, because Jesus Christ has hands and feet now in his State of <HI>Exal|tation.</HI> He has his humane nature <HI>still,</HI> and will have so to all Eternity: which humane nature of His shall be seen by every Eye at the <HI>last day.</HI> Luc. 23. 39, 40. Rev. 1. 7. And he has a <HI>rational Soul,</HI> which is the other <HI>essential</HI> part of humane Nature. <HI>His</HI> SOUL <HI>was made an Offering for sin.</HI> Isa. 53. 10. He complained that his <HI>SOUL was sorrowful un|to death,</HI> Mat. 26. 38. And when he was dy|ing he said, <HI>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</HI> Luc. 23. 46. The proper <HI>Facultyes</HI> of a reasonable soul are ascribed unto Christ. e. g. That of <HI>Understanding.</HI> When he was about 12 years old, he did so reason with the learned Doctors, as all that heard him were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">to|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ht

at his <HI>Understanding,</HI> and he increased in Wisdom, <HI>Luc.</HI> 2. 46, 52. Another Facul|ty of the Soul, is that of the <HI>Will:</HI> which is also affirmed of Christ. <HI>Luc.</HI> 22. 42. <HI>Not my</HI> Will <HI>but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Humane</HI> Actions <HI>are affirmed of Christ.</HI> e. g. Natural and common Actions performed by men in common with other creatures: such as <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking.</HI> These actions did Christ doe when in this lower world. <HI>Luc.</HI> 22. 15. 16. 18.

Joh. 8. 6. 7, 8.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Humane (sinless)</HI> Infirmities <HI>are affirmed of Christ.</HI> Therefore he is <HI>man</HI> as well as God. Indeed, as for those <HI>sinful Infirmities</HI> which we are so miserably subject unto, Christ had none of them; but other Infirmities he once had,

<HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 15. <HI>We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our</HI> infirmi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, <HI>but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin.</HI> It is therefore also said, that <HI>God sent his own son in the likeness of sinful fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h,</HI> Rom. 8. 4. The Son of God is not only in the <HI>likeness</HI> of flesh, for he is made <HI>real</HI> flesh but only <HI>like sinful</HI> flesh: As the <HI>Brazen</HI> Serpent was like a Serpent, but had no poison in it; so Christ was like unto sinful flesh, but never had the least degree of sin in his holy nature. Only as to <HI>other</HI> Infirmities he was as all other men are. Its true, that there are many perso|nal infirmityes of men which Christ had not experience of: there are many <HI>Diseases</HI> which particular persons are afflicted with, that Christ was never subject to, but the <HI>general</HI> infirmities of humane nature, he did subject unto. e. g. To <HI>Hunger, Thirst, Weariness,</HI> &amp;c. which are the general Infirmities of our nature. And so it was with Christ when in this world. <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 2. Indeed now he is entred into his <HI>glory,</HI> he is not subject to <HI>any</HI> infirmity; but during his state of humiliation he was so. Hence that state is expressed by <HI>the dayes of his fllesh.</HI> Heb. 5. 7. i. e. the time when he was subject to humane sinless infirmities. And Christ hath not laid aside the essential propertyes of his
<PB N="83" REF="000416_0090_0FA5B5D747796FD8">
humane nature. Tho' such in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rmityes as were accidental thereunto and necessary for his state of Humiliation are not consistent with his glo|rified estate; yet he carried to the right hand of God in Heaven his humane nature, even a soul and body, the very same that once suffered for the Sins of his people. He hath flesh and bones, (<HI>glorified</HI> flesh) now in heaven: And therefore a <HI>glorious</HI> body; for so does the Scripture declare and teach us to believe. We have a Saviour in heaven, <HI>who shall change our vile bodyes&punc; that they be fashioned like unto his glo|rious body.</HI> Phil. 3. 21.</P>
<P N="5">5. We may for the further Confirmation of this Truth, <HI>take notice how it has been mysteri|ously signify.</HI> In the dayes of the Old Testa|ment, the Son of God did sometimes appear in the form of a man to the Patriarchs; So he did to <HI>Abraham;</HI> and so to, <HI>Jacob</HI> and to <HI>Jo|shua</HI> and others (and some think that he ap|peared in the likeness that he was to take) we do not read that God the <HI>Father</HI> or that God the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> did ever appear in a <HI>humane shape</HI> to the Fathers, only <HI>God the Son</HI> did so: thereby to signify his future <HI>Incarnation;</HI> that in due time he would <HI>really</HI> be, as then he <HI>seem'd</HI> to be.</P>
<P>Moreover, The <HI>Tabernacle</HI> was a Type of Christ's humane nature, which is therefore

<PB N="85" REF="000416_0092_0FA5B5D91AB4D678">
Tabernacles</HI> which the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> kept in the seventh moneth, did signify that God would appear and dwell in our nature. The <HI>Temple</HI> was also a Type of Christ's body. Joh. 2. 19. Jesus said, <HI>destroy this</HI> Temple (pro|bably Christ did with his hand point at his own body as he spake these words:) in <HI>ver.</HI> 21. 'tis said, <HI>He spake of the Temple of his body.</HI> The Temple was the most costly, excellent, glorious, House in the world; thereby figure|ing the humane nature of Christ, which was adorned with graces and spiritual excellencies beyond any other man or creature. Particu|larly the <HI>Veil</HI> of the Temple typified the hu|mane nature of Christ. <HI>He has consecrated a new</HI> (Christ was then newly slain, and there is no other way after this, and therefore it is still and alwayes new) <HI>and living way for us, thro' the</HI> veil, <HI>that is to say his flesh.</HI> Heb. 20. As there was no entring into the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> but by the <HI>Veil;</HI> so there is no entring into Heaven but through that Sacrifice of the <HI>flesh,</HI> i. e. the <HI>humane nature</HI> of Christ. And this Truth is still mysteriously signifyed by that Ordinance of the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> The bread signifies the <HI>Body</HI> and the Wine the <HI>Bloud</HI> of Christ: And that Sacramental Action of <HI>Taking</HI> the Bread in order to the <HI>Consecration</HI> thereof, puts us in mind of Christ's taking our nature. That's a
<PB N="86" REF="000416_0093_0FA5B5DA05BA6670">
Meditation which should be in our hearts, as we see the Minister take the bread in or|der to the <HI>Blessing</HI> &amp; <HI>Breaking</HI> of it, we should then think of Christ's <HI>Incarnation,</HI> that the Son of God has assumed our nature, that so he might <HI>dye</HI> for our sakes</P>
<P>We come therefore to enquire into the <HI>Rea|sons</HI> of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>The Word was made flesh, because it was the Will of the Father to have it so.</HI> We have for|merly treated of the Covenant of <HI>Redemption,</HI> &amp; then was shewed that this was one Article i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Covenant, that the <HI>Son of God</HI> should take unto him the nature of Man. The Father said to Him, If thou willt be a Redeemer for sinful Man, thou must <HI>thy self</HI> become a man, and in that nature do what concerns a Re|deemer to perform. In Compliance with this Will of the Father, <HI>the Son of God was mani|fest in the flesh,</HI> Heb. 10. 5, 7. Joh. 14. <HI>ult&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Reason 2. <HI>That so he might be a fit</HI> Mediator <HI>between GOD and the children of</HI> men. <HI>There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</HI> 1. Tim. 2. 5. Hence Christ was fit to be a <HI>dayes man</HI> (as <HI>Job</HI> speaketh) Between them both. It was altogether ne|cessary
<PB N="87" REF="000416_0094_0FA5B5DB9CCEB5C8">
that the Mediator should be <HI>God|man.</HI> If Christ had been man <HI>only</HI> he could not have been a Mediator; He could not have saved one sinner, nor satisfyed for one sin. And if he had not been a <HI>man,</HI> but God <HI>only,</HI> He could not have been a <HI>Mediator.</HI> He that sanctifyeth and they that are sancctify<HI>ed,</HI> are <HI>all one,</HI> i. e. <HI>of one &amp; the same nature</HI> Heb. 2. 11. Since the <HI>Elect</HI> are partakers of flesh &amp; blood, He Himself took part of the same: Otherwise he could not have dyed, nor have made Recon|ciliation for the sins of his people. Except he had been made <HI>Flesh,</HI> He could not have shed His <HI>blood</HI> to make attonement for sinners.</P>
<P>USE. 1. <HI>We must conclude that Ignorance or Error about this great</HI> Truth; <HI>is of dangerous Consequence to the souls of men.</HI> It is indeed a Fundamental Article in our Christian Faith, the Knowledge whereof is necessary to Salvati|on. It is strange to consider, that any who live under the Gospel, should be ignorant of such a plain, easy, common principle of Re|ligion: nevertheless there are such. I have discoursed with some that goe under the name of Christians, that yet could not tell whether Christ were God or man, but when asked the question, have replyed that he was only
<PB N="88" REF="000416_0095_0FA5B5DC1E2F43B0">
<HI>God,</HI> as supposing that a man could not save them. But such dark and horrid Ignorance will be destructive to the souls of men. There are also, who tho' they do in words acknow|ledge it to be a great Truth, that <HI>the Son of God became a man;</HI> Nevertheless they hold such, errors as are not well consistent with the Truth which they profess. So do they who maintain the <HI>real Presence</HI> of the Body of Christ in the <HI>Sacrament:</HI> which is to say that Christ's Body hath not the true nature of a Body, and in effect to say, that He has only a <HI>divine</HI> na|ture. He that takes away the <HI>Propertyes</HI> of an humane nature denies that nature. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if Christ has no other nature but that which is in <HI>all</HI> places, then He hath only a <HI>divine</HI> nature. There are also a sort of men in the world, who hold that there is no Christ but what is <HI>within;</HI> and that Salvation is to be had, not from a <HI>Christ without,</HI> but from at Christ <HI>within.</HI> My Brethren, take heed of such errors, they that maintain them, let them pretend what they will, they deny the <HI>Humanity</HI> of Christ, and so overthrow the Faith, and subvert the <HI>souls</HI> of them that shall be so miserable as to give any Credit to their <HI>strong Delusions.</HI></P>

<P>THe Apostle having in the <HI>fourteenth</HI> verse of this Chapter exhorted the Beleeving <HI>Hebrews</HI> to follow Holi|ness, he does urge that Exhortation by an Ar|gument taken from the Consideration of that <HI>better state,</HI> which Believers under the <HI>New</HI>-Testament are in, compared with those of the <HI>Old.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Negatively,</HI> in the 18, 19, 20, and 21. verses of this Chapter; the Scope and Sum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> whereof amounts to thus much: We are not now under the sad, severe &amp; servile Dispen|sations of the <HI>Law,</HI> but under one more <HI>gra|cious,</HI> and therefore we ought to be more <HI>ho|ly.</HI> Holiness was required under the Law.

<P>This great Gospel Truth may be Explained and Confirmed in several Propositions,</P>
<P>Prop. 1.

<P>Propos.

He was in that a Type of Christ who has not only <HI>attempted,</HI> but gloriously <HI>accomplished</HI> a Reconciliation be|tween Heaven and earth, God and the world. When the First Covenant was broken, and thereby God and man set at variance; the question was, Who shall make up this breach? The Son of God steps in and undertakes to do it. Therefore He is said to be <HI>the Media|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or of the</HI> New <HI>Covenant.</HI> Hence he is in the Scripture styled <HI>the Prince of</HI> Peace. <HI>Isai.</HI> 9. 6.

Mediator of the <HI>New</HI>-Covenant, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3. 1.

He took not on him the</HI> nature <HI>of Angels.</HI> Therefore he is said to be an Angel, to <HI>denote</HI> his <HI>Office.</HI> Hence he is styled an <HI>Apostle,</HI> Heb. 3. 1. A <HI>Bishop,</HI> 1. Pet. 2. <HI>ult,</HI> A <HI>Minister,</HI> Heb. 8. 1, 6. A <HI>Priest,</HI> a <HI>Prophet,</HI> a <HI>King.</HI> (as af|terwards may more fully be declared.) Now all these Names are of <HI>Office.</HI> Moreover, those things which are required to constitute an Of|ficer, are hereby truly affirmed concerning <HI>Christ.</HI> Three Things have been observed as <HI>Requisites</HI> in one that is invested into Sa|cred Office.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Qualifications.</HI> God does first <HI>Fit</HI> men for their Work before he puts them upon it, He never sent any man upon an Errand, but gave him legs to go upon. Now thus it is true, concerning the man Christ Jesus. He, (and he only) is wonderfully qualifyed for the Work of Mediation which my Text speak|eth of. In the Temple (which was a Type of Christ) there were Utensils for every Ser|vice required therein. This signifying, that Christ. (the True Temple) was <HI>every</HI> way furnished for all that work, which as a
<PB N="122" REF="000416_0129_0FA5B53F6677FDF0">
Mediator is incumbent on Him. Hence he is said to be <HI>Anoynted,</HI> Psal 45 2. The Signifi|cation of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Messiah,</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> word, <HI>Christ,</HI> is <HI>Anointed.</HI> How? not <HI>materially</HI> but Spiritually; <HI>h. e.</HI> in respect of spiritual Qualifications and endowments fit|ting him for his Work. The gifts of the Holy Spirit were most plentifully poured on Him. <HI>Isai.</HI> 11. 1, 2, 3. There never was man or Angel, that had such gifts of the Spirit as Christ (considered as man) hath. And as to <HI>Grace and Holiness,</HI> he is admirably en|dowed and qualifyed, <HI>He is full of Grace, so as that of his fullness we have all received, and that grace for grace: for God giveth not the Spi|rit by measure unto him.</HI> Joh. 1. 14, 16. and 3. 34.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing required to Constitute an Officer is an <HI>outward Call.</HI> Inward Qualifica|tion without <HI>external Vocation</HI> is not enough to make an Officer. No man ought to take that Honour to himself except he be called of God, as was <HI>Aaron.</HI> Heb. 5. 4. Or|dinary Officers have their Call from God by <HI>man:</HI> and <HI>Extra</HI>ordinary Officers have their Call <HI>immediately</HI> from <HI>God:</HI> as the Apostle does distinguish, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 1. Christ had his Call from God, who did (to speak after the
<PB N="123" REF="000416_0130_0FA5B5402CEAF278">
manner of Men) give Him a Commission, as it were under hand and Seal, to undertake the Work of a Redeemer. <HI>Joh.</HI> 6. 22. <HI>for him has God the Father Sealed.</HI> And of him does God say, <HI>I the Lord have called thee in Righ|teousness, and will give thee for a Covenant to the people.</HI> Isai. 42. 6. Therefore he may be <HI>well</HI> called the <HI>Mediator of the new Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In order to Consummating sacred Office|Relation, <HI>Consecration,</HI> and solemn <HI>Separation</HI> is necessary. <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons were to be <HI>consecrated to the Lord, that they might minister in the</HI> Priests Office. <HI>Exod.</HI> 30. 30. And the Holy Ghost said, <HI>separate</HI> me <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> for the work whereunto I have <HI>called</HI> them. <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 2. God Himself hath Consecrated his Son Jesus Christ to the work of a Media|tor. <HI>The Son is consecrated for ever more.</HI> Heb. 7. 28. <HI>Him the Father hath Sanctified and sent into the world.</HI> Joh. 10. 31. Yea, and Jesus has set <HI>Himself</HI> apart for the Work of a Medi|ator between God and the Elect. Therefore he saith, <HI>For your sakes I sanctify my self,</HI> Joh. 17. 19. There is a Sanctification in respect of Consecration and Separation to the Service of God: which glorious Mystery is indeed de|clared in the Administration of the Lord's

Supper. For when the Elements are separa|ted and solemnly consecrated, we are there|by taught that Christ hath been set apart as <HI>the Mediator of the new-Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>But this will appear further by speaking to the next Proposition.</P>
<P>Propos. IV. <HI>The Father has committed the Work of Redemption to the Son of God: who hath accordingly undertaken that Charge.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) I say the, Father has <HI>committed</HI> that work of Christ. God has said to his Son, As for the work of <HI>Redemption,</HI> I leave <HI>that</HI> to <HI>thee</HI> do <HI>thou</HI> take care of that matter. Upon this account it is, that Christ is said to receive a Commandment and Charge from God the Fa|ther. Joh. 14. 21. <HI>As the Father gave me Commandment</HI> (said Christ when he was going to dy for the Redemption of his Elect) <HI>even so do I.</HI> He neither <HI>Did</HI> nor <HI>Suffered</HI> any thing in order to the Salvation of his people but what God <HI>bid</HI> him do. Hence all the work which Christ did in the world, is said to be, the work which the <HI>Father gave him to do.</HI> Joh. 17. 4. On this account he is said to be infe|rior to the Father; not in respect of <HI>nature,</HI> as he is the <HI>Son</HI> of God, but as he is the <HI>Me|diator.</HI> Joh. 10. 29. Yea, he is God's
<PB N="125" REF="000416_0132_0FA5B54325D69988">
<HI>Commissioner.</HI> (To express heavenly Mysteries by earthly Similitudes) He hath the <HI>great Seal of Heaven</HI> to Authorize him to act as MEDIATOR. Hence he is called the Lord's <HI>Messenger,</HI> Mal. 3. 1. And in <HI>John'</HI>s <HI>Gospel</HI> Christ is said to be <HI>sent of God,</HI> no less than twenty times over.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Jesus Christ has <HI>accepted</HI> this Charge. Tho it be the greatest Work, and weighty|est Charge that ever was, yet Christ (who alone was able) hath undertaken it. This might serve for a Description of Christ's me|diatorial Office, <HI>It is that</HI> Charge <HI>which He hath undertaken in order to the Salvation of the Elect.</HI> Tho he be in respect of nature, <HI>equal</HI> with God, he took upon him the form of a <HI>Servant.</HI> And being found in fashion as a man, he became obedient unto Death, Hence Christ is styled a <HI>Surety. Jesus is made</HI> a Surety <HI>of a better Testament.</HI> Heb. 7. 22. which implyes the same thing with this of his being <HI>the Mediator of the new Covenant.</HI> God saith, My Law must be fulfilled, and my Justice must be satisfied: now Christ the Son of GOD comes in, and sayes, As for those things, I'le undertake to see them alone. He engageth to do that for them, which they are never able to do for <HI>themselves.</HI>

man or <HI>Angel</HI> could go through with it: But since it is in the hand of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the Son of GOD, there's no fear of miscarriage.

Now this is a great Comfort. Suppose a man to be miserably in <HI>Debt;</HI> If a Surety interpose that is able to pay the Debt, that's a Comfort to him: even so is the Case here.</P>
<P>Consid. 2. <HI>Jesus Christ is a</HI> Willing <HI>Mediator,</HI> Poor souls are apt to be discouraged, not so much in respect of the power of Christ, which they doubt not of, as from his <HI>Will</HI> to save them. They are ready to say as the <HI>Leper</HI> did, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8. 3. <HI>Lord, if thou</HI> wilt <HI>thou canst make me clean.</HI> But know, Christ is <HI>willing</HI> to reconcile thee to God, if thou art will|ing to <HI>be</HI> reconciled to him.

He began the work of Media|tion at first most Willingly: He hath gone through the greatest and heaviest part of his Work with much Willingness. He laid down his life of <HI>Himself,</HI> there was none took it from him against his will. That work of
<PB N="150" REF="000416_0157_0FA5B5607AFE9D88">
Suffering for Sin, and Satisfying divine Justice is done: and therefore we may besure, he is willing to attend what remaines respecting the work of <HI>Intercession.</HI> If thou are a <HI>comer</HI> to him, He is willing to intercede for thee. He is ready to put in a good word for thee in heaven before the Father of Glory. He <HI>liveth</HI> for that end. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 25.</P>
<P>Consid. 3. <HI>Now there is a</HI> Mediator <HI>for poor Sinners whose Mediation is</HI> Meritorious. It is so because, <HI>Jesus</HI> is the Mediator. There's Merit in the Bloud of Christ, for he is the Son of GOD. Had we none but saints or Angels to Mediate for us, we were in a said case, because <HI>they</HI> can't <HI>merit.</HI> But <HI>Christ</HI> has merited all saving good for all his. He is a Redeemer by <HI>Price.</HI> As for the Elect, He has bought every one of them, body and soul, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 20. Yea, and he hath bought <HI>Heaven</HI> for them too, which is therefore called the <HI>purchased</HI> Possession, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 14. And Christ is now <HI>Interceding</HI> in Heaven through the Me|rit of his blood. Hence his Blood is said to <HI>speak;</HI> so sayes the Apostle here, It speaketh <HI>better things than the bloud of Abel.</HI> It hath a loud Cry with it; a louder than that of <HI>A|bel's</HI> bloud; and yet <HI>that</HI> cryed so as that it

<P>Consid. 4. That <HI>Both the</HI> Person <HI>and the</HI> Prayers <HI>of the Comer to</HI> Christ, <HI>shall find Ac|ceptance through him who is the</HI> MEDIATOR.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, there are <HI>two</HI> Things con|tained.</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Sermon</HI> preached by <HI>John Baptist:</HI> whereby he doth prepare his Auditors for Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Christ's Baptism:</HI> and un|der that the Evangelist has recorded <HI>three</HI> mi|raculous Providences, which did at that time come to pass.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="158" REF="000416_0164_0FA5B565AFB2E448">1. The Opening of the Heavens, <HI>ver.</HI> 15. No doubt but the Heavens were really opened, by the infinite power of the Almighty: where|by may be signifyed, that <HI>Heaven</HI> which was shutt against all the Children of fallen man is opened to them now, <HI>in</HI> and <HI>by</HI> Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another miraculous Thing which did attend the Baptism of Christ was, that the Holy Ghost did visibly descend upon them like a Dove. <HI>(ibid.)</HI> And this might be, that so the Prophesy of <HI>Isaiah</HI> might be fulfilled <HI>li|terally</HI> as well as spiritually, <HI>Cap.</HI> 61. 1. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is come upon me.</HI> Also there by to Intimate, how Christ was filled was the Spirit of Innocency and Meekness.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was a miraculous <HI>Voice</HI> which came from God out of Heaven; and that is expressed in this verse, wherein we have a most glorious, Divine Testimony concern|ing Christ: GOD from Heaven does here testify <HI>two</HI> things of Him:</P>
<P N="1">1. That He is <HI>His Son,</HI> yea, His <HI>Beloved</HI> Son. <HI>He</HI> is so His <HI>Son,</HI> as none else is; so <HI>Beloved,</HI> as none else is. Angels are the sons of God, but they only in respect of <HI>Cre|ation. Believers</HI> are the Sons of God, but in respect of Adoption: Whereas <HI>Christ</HI> is
<PB N="159" REF=" 000416_0165_0FA5B56676820A60">
not the son of God on those accounts, but in respect of nature. And therefore Jesus Christ is more dear to God than all Saints and An|gels.</P>
<P N="2">2. God does here testi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ie concerning his Son Jesus Christ, that he is <HI>well pleased</HI> In <HI>Him:</HI> Now this pleasure of the Father in Christ, doth intimate not only, that GOD taketh infinite <HI>Delight</HI> in Christ, (though <HI>that</HI> be part of what is intended, these words alluding to <HI>Isa.</HI> 42. 1. and 62. 4.) but also that the Father hath received <HI>Sa|tisfaction</HI> in <HI>and</HI> by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Hence, It is not said <HI>I am well pleased</HI> with <HI>him,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him: That is to say God is paci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yed <HI>in</HI> and <HI>by</HI> Jesus Christ.

Three Things may be attended.</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew that there is a <HI>Necessity</HI> of this thing, that God should be satisfyed for the Wrong done to him by the sins of his peo|ple. 2. That Jesus Christ has satisfyed the Father. 3. The Reasons of this <HI>Doctrine;</HI> whence it is, that the Obedience of Je|sus Christ is Satisfactory.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="1">1. It is evident in that God hath <HI>decreed</HI> &amp; <HI>declared</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> shall be <HI>punished.</HI> There is an Eternal Decree concerning this Thing. Now upon a suppositi|on of the Decree of God, that Sin shall be <HI>punished,</HI> it necessa|rily followes that the Event will be accordingly. For the De|crees of God are <HI>unchangeable:</HI> Hence are they <HI>fitly</HI> compared
<PB N="161" REF="000416_0167_0FA5B56898D0DC08">
<HI>to mountains of brass.</HI> Zech. 6. 1. Also this Decree is <HI>published,</HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> In the written Law, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10. Yea, When God made man at at first, He did peremptorily declare that <HI>Sin</HI> should be punished with <HI>Death.</HI> Gen. 2. 17. Wherefore the Apostle saith, that <HI>It is appointed unto men once to</HI> dye, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 27. There is a <HI>Statute law</HI> which must take place, <HI>sc.</HI> that in Gen. 2. 17. So that it cannot stand with the Wisedom nor with the Veracity of God to pardon sin without Satisfaction; He having decreed and declared otherwise.</P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Demonstration is, <HI>that God's pu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ishing Sin does proceed not only from his</HI> Will, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut from his</HI> Nature. Hence there was a ne|cessity of Satisfaction, If God punish sin only <HI>voluntarily,</HI> there would not be such a necessi|ty of Satisfaction as indeed there is. Where|fore it is from the Nature &amp; essential Justice of God that Sin is punished, as appears</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that when the Scripture speaketh of God's Punishing Sin, it is ascribed not only to his</HI> Will, <HI>but to his</HI> just Nature. <HI>Psal.</HI> 11. 6. 7. The <HI>Psalmist</HI> giveth it as the Reason why God does punish the Wicked, even because he is <HI>righteous.</HI> The Nature of God is such, as that he cannot but love Righteousness, and so hate &amp; punish Wickedness. <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 5. 2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 6.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="162" REF="000416_0168_0FA5B56B29E910A0">2. It is Evident in that <HI>God is the</HI> SU|PREAM <HI>Governour and Judge of All.</HI> Gen. 18. 25. Rom. 3. 5, 6. God hath not only an absolute Soveraignty over his creatures, in respect whereof He may punish or spare, kill or keep alive; but He is moreover a <HI>Judge,</HI> in respect whereof it is necessary he should pu|nish the guilty. It is necessary to a Judge to punish where the Law requires him so to do. Now what <HI>Law</HI> is to <HI>another</HI> Judge who is to proceed by it, that is the infinite <HI>Rectitude</HI> of God's own <HI>Nature</HI> to <HI>Him.</HI> Tho' the Lord's Dominion be absolute, yet he does not <HI>rule</HI> (as it were) arbitrarily, without Respect to any <HI>Rule</HI> or <HI>Law.</HI> But that God should have any <HI>external</HI> Law prescribed to him in the Govern|ment of the world is infinitely impossible; therefore His <HI>Law</HI> is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of his <HI>own Nature.</HI> Hence it is necessary, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with his <HI>Creatures,</HI> He should act ac|cording to that, and therefore manifest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> against Sin.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The Infinite</HI> Holiness <HI>of the blessed GOD
<PB N="163" REF="000416_0169_0FA5B56CB2C55C38">
does punish sin not only from his</HI> Will <HI>but His</HI> Na|ture. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 2. Rev. 15. 4. Hence God is said to <HI>hate</HI> Sin. <HI>Psal.</HI> 5. 4. Yea, and this <HI>Displicency</HI> against sin is <HI>natural</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nto the Blessed God. He cannot but <HI>hate</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. It is inconsistent with the holy Nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, to love any sin, or not to <HI>hate</HI> every sin. <HI>Hab.</HI> 1. 13. It is not said that God <HI>will</HI> not, but that <HI>He</HI> can<HI>not took upon iniquity.</HI> He cannot ap|prove of it; which evinceth that sin is con|trary to the Nature of God, and that the pu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity of His Nature does require that Sin should be duly punished. And on the account of the infinite <HI>Holiness</HI> of God it is that He is com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ared to a <HI>consuming fire</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isai.</HI> 33. 15. be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ause it is <HI>natural</HI> to God (acting nevertheless as a free and intellectual Agent) to hate and punish sin.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The common</HI> Suffrage <HI>of Man-kind doth give in Evidence to this Truth, That such is the Nature of God, that</HI> sin <HI>must of necessity be sa|tisfied for.</HI> There is such an innate principle as this engraven upon the very Conscience of men, that God will punish sin. Hence the Apostle speaking concerning the Generality of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> saith as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 32. <HI>Who know|ing the judgement of God, that they which commit
<PB N="164" REF="000416_0170_0FA5B56E6C64DE40">
such things are worthy of death.</HI> They <HI>knew-</HI> that God judged this meet to be done, even that <HI>Sin</HI> should be punished with death. Hence even those <HI>Barbarians</HI> could say, (as in <HI>Act.</HI> 28. 4.) <HI>Vengeance will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him to live.</HI> They look'd upon <HI>Vengeance [<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">]</HI> us a Deity that would surely find out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that deserved Death, but escaped it from the hands of men. Such a notion was implanted in their minds, that, there is a GOD who will take Vengeance for Sin. From this it came to pass that the Gentiles had so many Sacrifices, thinking that this would pacify a provoked God. And from this principle it is, that the Consciencies of sin|ners do secretly sting them &amp; condemn them, when they do evil in the sight of God, <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 2. 15. Now Conscience is a man's Judging of himself, as God will judge him forever. Yea, and from this principle it is, that when men do apprehend themselves any wayes injured, they appeal to <HI>God</HI> to right them. Surely, there would not be such a presumption in the minds of <HI>all</HI> men that God will punish sin, if his punishing thereof did proceed meerly from an Act of his Will, and not from an essential property of His Nature. For the Acts of God's <HI>Will</HI> which are meerly such) are not known but by <HI>Revelation;</HI> whenas this, That God will punish sin, is known by the Light of <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="000416_0171_0FA5B56EA0AAD6B8">
without any special Revelation, which shows that it proceeds <HI>not</HI> meerly from the <HI>Will,</HI> but from the righteous <HI>Nature</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>If God's Punishing Sin be meerly from his</HI> Will, <HI>then it would follow, that he is as free to</HI> reward <HI>sin as to</HI> punish <HI>it.</HI> That Sin or <HI>no</HI> Sin is all one him: for all the meerly-free Acts of God's Will <HI>might</HI> have been <HI>otherwise.</HI> And then whereas he doth will men to <HI>love</HI> &amp; <HI>serve</HI> him, He <HI>might</HI> have will'd them to <HI>hate</HI> &amp; <HI>oppose</HI> him, and that no punishment should have been due to them on the account of any Disobedience: but this cannot stand with the nature of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>God would not have caused</HI> Christ <HI>to have suffered such bitter things, if there had not been a</HI> necessity <HI>of Satisfaction.</HI> Would God have caused his only begotten <HI>Son</HI> to come into the world &amp; to dye such an accursed death to save sinners, if there had bin a possibility of pardon and Salvation without Satisfaction. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 32. These things then make it appear that God does <HI>naturally</HI> &amp; <HI>necessarily</HI> punish sin. Only we must know, that when God is said <HI>naturally</HI> to <HI>punish</HI> sin, <HI>natural</HI> is not to be taken in <HI>every</HI> re|spect in that sense as when it is said, that it's <HI>na|tural</HI> for the <HI>Fire to burn,</HI> or the like: as if God should <HI>necessarily</HI> punish sin as soon as it's <HI>com|mitted</HI> or to the utmost of His Power <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
<PB N="166" REF="000416_0172_0FA5B56F78FACAC0">
natural is taken in that sense as when we say it is natural to a man to <HI>speak,</HI> or <HI>laugh,</HI> or <HI>weep;</HI> but the <HI>exercise</HI> of these properties which are natural is subject to <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Liberty.</HI> Also, One may be said to act <HI>freely,</HI> that yet upon supposition of this or that doth act <HI>ne|cessarily.</HI> God alwaies acts freely in what|ever he doth. It is free to Him to speak to his Creatures or <HI>not</HI> to speak to them, but up|on Supposition that he will do so, it is necessa|ry that he should speak <HI>Truth,</HI> nor <HI>can</HI> he speak otherwise. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 13. Tit. 1. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 18.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>second</HI> Thing propound|ed in order to the Doctrine before us, That is to shew,</P>
<P>That <HI>Christ hath satisfyed the Father for the Wrong that hath been done by the</HI> Sins <HI>of his People.</HI> This is a great Mystery of the Gos|pel&punc; all the Knowledge we have about it is su|pernatural.

the death of a <HI>man. Only</HI> the Scriptures do most clearly &amp; abundantly reveal this Truth: we shall therefore keep close to the Scripture in producing Arugments for the Confirmati|on of the Doctrine before us.</P>
<P>Arg. I. <HI>All those Sriptures which speak of God being pacified by Christ, prove that he hath satis|fyed the Father.</HI> For that is intended by the Satisfaction of Christ, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That He hath done that whereby God is <HI>pacified</HI> towards His people; all their sins and Injuries offered to him thereby, notwithstanding. But this the Scripture speaketh abundantly of. Hence God is said to be <HI>pleased</HI> in <HI>and</HI> by <HI>Him,</HI> as as we have heard the Text before us express|ing. Hence we read of <HI>Reconciliation</HI> by <HI>Christ,</HI> 2. Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 5. 10. And of <HI>Peace</HI> with God through <HI>Christ.</HI> Cap. 5. 1. Col. 1. 20. And of <HI>Attonement</HI> by Christ. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 11. And of Christ's being a <HI>Propitiation,</HI> Cap. 3. 25. 1. Joh. 2. 2.

<PB N="168" REF="000416_0174_0FA5B570D8A70130">
therefore we are said to be reconciled and at peace with God by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Arg. II. <HI>All those Scriptures which speake of Jesus Christ's being offered on the account of the sins of his people, evince the Truth of this Doctrine of Christ's</HI> SATISFACTION. For that was the end of Christs being made an Offering for Sin, that Satisfaction to divine Justice might thereby be accomplished. In the Scriptures Christ is said to be an <HI>Oblation,</HI> Heb. 10. 10 &amp; 9. 28. And <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> ver. 26. 1. Cor&punc; 5. 7. On the same account Christ is called a <HI>Lamb,</HI> Joh. 1. 29. And an <HI>Altar,</HI> Heb. 13. 10. And this was the great intendment of all Sa|crifices under the Law, even to hold forth the Satisfaction of Christ. When they were offered God was pacifyed towards his Sinning people: see 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 26. 19. <HI>If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offer|ing.</HI> q. d. Let Him be <HI>appeased</HI> or <HI>satisfyed</HI> therewith: see also 2. Sam. 24. 25. <HI>Gen.</HI> 8. 20. 26. <HI>The Lord smelled a sweet savour.</HI> The Expression intimates that God was well pleas|ed with that Offering. Now those Sacrifices could not of themselves satisfy or appease the the wrath of God, it was not possible that they should, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 4. only as they were Types of
<PB N="169" REF="000416_0175_0FA5B571E74859C8">
Christ, and did put the Lord in mind of the Sacrifices of the <HI>New</HI> Testament in due time to be offered. God was pacified towards Believ|ers under the Old Testament on the account of <HI>this</HI> Sacrifice which was to take place when the <HI>Fulness of time</HI> should come, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 15.</P>
<P>Arg. III. <HI>All those Scriptures which speak of Christ's bring a</HI> Redeemer, <HI>do evince the Doctrine of His Satisfaction to Divine Justice.</HI> Tit. 2. 14. For Christ is a Redeemer, not only by <HI>Power</HI> but by <HI>Price.</HI> Hence his people are said to be <HI>bought</HI> by him, yea, <HI>bought with a</HI> Price. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 20. &amp; 7. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

The <HI>Greek</HI> word <HI>[antilutron]</HI> there used, signifi|eth the laying down of a just valuable price, even as much as the Thing is worth.

<P>We come in the <HI>Third</HI> place to enquire in|to the <HI>Reasons</HI> of this Doctrine: We shall mention but Two. The <HI>First</HI> shall be ta|ken from the Dignity of Christ's Person; the <HI>Second</HI> from the perfection of His Obe|dience.</P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>From the Dignity of Christ's</HI> Person. He is the <HI>SON of GOD,</HI> as the Text, expresseth; and thence a Person of Infinite Worth and Dignity, which doth add value to His Sufferings and Satisfaction. It is true that the <HI>Humane</HI> nature only suffered, (if we speak <HI>strictly</HI>) all Passion being incom|patible to the <HI>Divine</HI> Nature, nevertheless by Reason of the <HI>personal Union</HI> between the two Natures of Christ, that which does pro|perly belong to <HI>one</HI> nature is truly affirmed of the <HI>Person.</HI> It is therefore most true that the Second Person of the Trinity, even the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> Himself, became subject to the poenalty of the Law, in order to the appeas|ing of the wrath and satisfying the Justice of

the Father, who was the Person directly offend|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> sin. What Christ hath done in order to Salvation, He did as <HI>Mediator;</HI> and therefore not as <HI>God only</HI> nor as <HI>man only</HI> but as <HI>God-man.</HI> Now for <HI>such</HI> a Person to become sub|ject to the poenalty of the Law, and to the Wrath of God, is (as I have else-where ex|pressed) more than if all Men and Angels had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay'n under His Wrath, through out the dayes of Eternity: therefore well might the Lord say that He was <HI>pleased in,</HI> or <HI>pacifyed by</HI> his Son Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>From the perfection of Christ's Obedi|enc.</HI> His <HI>active</HI> obedience was <HI>perfect,</HI> He did fulfill all that the Law <HI>required</HI> to be done, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 15.

the behalf of those for whom he dyed. We must not under pretence of exalting <HI>free-Grace,</HI> rob God of the Glory of his Justice and Righ|teousness. When men say that <HI>God is merci|ful,</HI> and therefore they may be sayed though they should not repent and believe, they do under pretence of magnifying <HI>Mercy</HI> robb <HI>God</HI> of the glory of his Truth and Holiness. So it is when men deny the satisfaction of Christ, under pretence of being saved by Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> Let it be a Word of Exhortation.</P>
<P><HI>Let us make sure of an interest in the Glorious Satisfaction which Christ hath made.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P>Consider 1. <HI>That an Interest herein is abso|lutely necessary.</HI> For <HI>GOD</HI> is Displeased and his Wrath incensed by the sins of men. That Wrath which burneth to the Bottom of Hell is kindled against thy soul, and nothing but the bloud of Christ can quench that infinite Flame. God has said <HI>The soul that sinneth shall dye.</HI> There never was one sin commited since the world began (nor ever shall be) which shall escape un-punished. But it hath been

punished either in Him who is the Surety for Beleeving sinners, or in the sinner <HI>himself</HI> to Eternity. Satisfaction is necessary, nor is there any other way of Satisfaction to the Just|ice of God, but only <HI>this.</HI> All a mans <HI>own</HI> Righteousness will avail nothing as to Sa|tisfaction for Transgressions that are past. Prayers and Duties can do nothing as to this matter.

<P>Hence it comes to pass that the misery of the damned is <HI>ETERNAL,</HI> because they are never able to make full satisfaction to the

<P>COncerning the Pen-men of this <HI>Psalm</HI> there is nothing certain to be deter|mined.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ as man has a larger measure of the</HI> Holy Spirit <HI>than ever was communicated to any Creature.</HI> In that respect He is said to be <HI>an|ointed with oyl</HI> above <HI>his follows:</HI> as in the Scrip|ture but now mentioned.

It is written concerning <HI>Solomon,</HI> That he was wiser than all men, and that GOD gave him Understanding <HI>exceeding much,</HI> and Largeness of heart even as the Sand that is on the Sea-Shore. (1. King. 4. 29.) Intimating

that his enlarged Understanding did compre|hend a multitude of Notions and Concepti|ons in number like the sand of the Sea. In <HI>that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Solomon</HI> was a Type of Christ. Yet let me say, Solomon had a very shallow understanding and Comprehension of things, if compared with the man Christ Jesus. Christ's Wis|dome is a thousand times greater than ever <HI>Solomons</HI> was, or than ever any other man attain'd unto. And the <HI>Soul</HI> of Christ is en|dowed and adorned with all spiritual Graces, in the Highest degree that can be. The pro|phet <HI>Isaiah</HI> saw the Lord sitting upon a Throne, and his train filled the Temple: There are a train of glorious <HI>Graces</HI> which fill the Temple of Christ's humane Nature. There is no other man on earth or in heaven hath so much grace but it is possible for him to have yet more; but the man <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is so full of Grace, as that it is impossible for him to have more. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 14. <HI>The Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us</HI> full of Grace <HI>and truth.</HI> Yea, and <HI>of his Fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</HI> ver. 16. What aglorious and in|expressible fulness of Grace is that! To have so much fulness of Grace, as to be able to im|part thereof to <HI>all</HI> the Elect of God.

Yea, as full of <HI>Grace,</HI> as the Sun is full of <HI>Light:</HI> for which cause He is styled the <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> Mal. 4. 2. And he said of him|self, <HI>I am the</HI> Light <HI>of the world.</HI> Joh. 8. 12. There are some Believers who have received a large measure of spiritual gifts &amp; graces, but have it all from <HI>Christ.</HI> How full is <HI>He</HI> then! We read in <HI>Zech.</HI> 4. 11, 12.

Then what an unmeasureable Fulness of the Grace of the Spirit has the Lord Jesus received! There is in Christ an inexhaustible Ocean of Grace.

A man's Soul is not more truly united to his <HI>Body,</HI> than the <HI>Godhead</HI> is united to the <HI>humane nature</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> which is more than can be said of any creature excepting only the sin|gular <HI>humane nature</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> Now by virtue of the <HI>Hypostatical union,</HI> that Man becometh the Son of GOD. And because He <HI>is</HI> the Son of GOD, all the Glory that possibly can be, becometh His Due: That indeed, when the Man Christ Jesus ascended into heaven, and there sat down at the Right hand of God,
<PB N="206" REF="000416_0210_0FA5A9F3F4547818">
He did but take his place according to the Dignity of his person. And because of this it is but meet that all the Angels in heaven should be made subject to that Man: Yea, and that all creatures in the whole world should be put under his Feet.</P>

<P><HI>Let it affect all our hearts, to Consider of the Glory of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Something by way of Motive, and by way of Counsel: Let me briefly speak to you.</P>
<P>Consider 1. <HI>It is not possible for any of us to set our hearts upon a more glorious Object than</HI> Christ is. The most glorious Persons and Things that ever have been in the world, were only <HI>Types</HI> of him, and did but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hew a faint Resemblance of his Glory. Was not <HI>Joseph</HI> a <HI>Glorious</HI> Person when he said to his Brethren, <HI>you shall tell my father of all my glory,</HI> Gen. 45. 13. He was but a Type of Christ. When the <HI>High-Priest</HI> appeared with glorious holy Gar|ments upon him, how glorious was he! yet but a <HI>type</HI> of Christ. Behold King <HI>Solomon</HI> upon his Throne, the most excellent person
<PB N="207" REF="000416_0211_0FA5A9F4B18988A8">
in the whole world, only a <HI>Type</HI> of Christ. As the Lord speakes concerning the <HI>Lilly,</HI> Mat. 6. 29. Solomon <HI>in all his</HI> glory <HI>was not arayed like one of these.</HI> So I say, <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory was not ara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed like <HI>this Man:</HI> He was not aray'd with MAJESTY and bedeck't with GLORY as the Man <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is. His humane nature is now so <HI>glorious</HI> as that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mortal eye is able to look upon it. The Apo|stle <HI>Joh,</HI> whilst Christ was in his state of Hu|miliation lay in His Bosome, being admit|ted into the greatest Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iarityes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Love; yet this Apostle when he had a <HI>miraculous,</HI> sight of Christ in <HI>Glory,</HI> he saith, <HI>when I saw Him, I fell down at his feet as dead.</HI> Rev. 1. 17. If Christ as he is now in Glory, should appear to any of us, we should fall down dead be|fore him. But <HI>what</HI> then is the Glory of Christ consider'd as <HI>GOD!</HI> So he is the <HI>Lord</HI> of Glory. What a glorious Person is Jesus Christ, in whom created glory in the highest degree, and <HI>increated</HI> GLORY meet together! All the Angels in heaven are amazed at His Glo|ry. The <HI>Seraphims</HI> when they behold his Glo|ry cover their Faces as acknowledging their unworthiness and their inability to look upon that Glory: <HI>and one cryed unto another and said, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts, the

whole earth is full of his Glory.</HI> Isai. 6. 2, 3 So there are Thousands of Angels and ten thou|sand times ten Thousand of those ministring Spirits, who are all saying to Christ, O Thou <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy</HI> Son of God, the whole hea|ven is full of thy Glory.</P>
<P>Consid. 2. <HI>It is the property of a true believ|er to be</HI> much affected with <HI>the Glory of Christ.</HI> The Spouse in the Canticles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, My <HI>Beloved</HI> (i. e. Christ) is the Chief of Ten Thousand. When some said, <HI>What is thy beloved, more than</HI> another <HI>Beloved?</HI> The Reply is, <HI>He is alto|gether lovely.</HI> Chapt. 5. 10. 6. As for Un|believers, they never had real visions of the Glory of Christ. The very Language of their hearts is, <HI>He hath no form nor comeliness: and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</HI> Isai. 53. 2. But <HI>Believers</HI> (who know best) are of another mind. God has opened their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to see that <HI>Beauty</HI> in the Person of Christ that their souls are e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amour'd with him. 1. Pet. 2. 7. <HI>To you that</HI> believe <HI>He is precious.</HI> This is the Chief Reason why believers are willing to dye and to leave this world, it is because they would fain see the Glory of Christ. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>I desire to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">epart and to be with Christ.</HI> Ay, <HI>that'</HI>s the Reason
<PB N="210" REF="000416_0213_0FA5B4E2A02A7B58">
their <HI>eyes</HI> behold the Glory of Jesus Christ. With those very eyes which have behold the Tokens and Signs of his body, in that Ordi|nance of the Lords Supper, they shall look upon him <HI>in all his Glory</HI> for ever. And their souls will be Satisfied with that <HI>Blessed Sight.</HI> As <HI>Jacob</HI> said, <HI>It is enough,</HI> Joseph <HI>my son is yet alive, I will go and see him before I dy.</HI> Gen. 45. <HI>ult.</HI> So the Believer when he cometh to hea|ven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, Now I have enough: I see the Glory of Jesus Christ, and now I have enough. That blessed Glory is a soul-<HI>satisfying</HI> object. Hence <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>When I awake,</HI> i. e. at the Resurrection, <HI>I shall be</HI> satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed <HI>with thy like|ness.</HI> h. e. with beholding the Glory of Christ; for He alone is the Likeness of God. <HI>Psal.</HI> 17. 15. And yet glorifyed Saints will never be weary with looking upon the Glory of Christ in Heaven.</P>
<P>By way of Counsel.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Think often upon Christ and his Glory.</HI> The more a man thinks of it, the more will he be affected <HI>with it.</HI> Occasional thoughts of this should very often come into our hearts. If a Christian have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> any time lived many hours in a day and had no thoughts in his heart, concerning <HI>Christ</HI> and His <HI>Glory,</HI> he has cause to be humbled. But besides that, It is good
<PB N="211" REF="000416_0214_0FA5B4E34F20E4F0">
and exceeding profitable to set time apart, solemnly to meditate on the glory of Christ. A Christian shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by experience that such meditations will wonderfully take his heart off from things here below. What is all the world, when a man by Faith looketh upon the Glory of Christ, in comparison of whom Ten Thousand worlds are all as nothing. What are Riches? What are Honours? What are Friends? What are Relations? One View of the Glory of <HI>Christ</HI> drowns them <HI>all,</HI> and makes them to vanish into nothing.</P>
<P>And such Meditations tend to make the heart more <HI>Holy.</HI> Beholding the glory of the Lord we are changed into the same image, from Glory to Glory 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 18. He that useth himself to such Meditations will cer|tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly be a very holy man. Remember the Apostles Exhortation, 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 18. <HI>Grow in grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> He that groweth in the Know|ledge of Christ, will grow in grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Prize those things which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Glory of Christ.</HI> If we are duly affected with His glory we shall do so. The <HI>Gospel</HI> and the <HI>Ordinan|ces</HI> of it reveal Christ. We behold <HI>as in a glass</HI> the glory of the Lord. The Gospel is a <HI>Per|spective glass,</HI> and if we have an ey of Faith we
<PB N="212" REF="000416_0215_0FA5B4E3E9A64EC8">
shall see the glory of <HI>Christ</HI> therein. And in special manner in that blessed Ordinance of the Lord's Supper: There we see His glorious <HI>Love.</HI> That the eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> GOD should become a <HI>man,</HI> and in our nature make him|self a Sacrifice to divine Justice, Suffering in his Body and in his soul the pains of the first and of the <HI>Second death,</HI> that so he might rede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> us from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Death, What glorious Love was this! Here's a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Loves</HI> indeed. Let's sing this new Song both now, and in Heaven for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Goe to</HI> God <HI>for His Spirit.</HI> There is much of the Spirit of God in those Truths which concern the glory of Christ. 'Tis the Holy Spirit that does reveal them. It is the Holy Spirit that does affect the heart <HI>with</HI> them. Hence Christ said, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. 14. <HI>The Spirit of truth shall</HI> glorify <HI>me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</HI> And if the Holy Spirit make a saving Revelation of Christ's glory to our souls <HI>now</HI> through <HI>faith,</HI> it will not be long before we shall <HI>see him as he is,</HI> and for ever <HI>behold his glory.</HI> In the mean time, Let every true Believer, to his everlasting com|fort remember that Scripture with which I shall conclude <HI>Isa.</HI> 33. 17. <HI>Thine eyes shall see the KING in His Beauty.</HI> Amen! Even so Come LORD JESUS!</P>
