<P>I AM glad to see you at this House,&mdash;here a Council Fire is alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> burn|ing&punc;&mdash;here a Tree of Shelter is planted, not only for the <HI>Six-Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> but for all <HI>Indians</HI> who are, or desire to be in Peace and Friendship with the <HI>English,</HI> and will acknowledge the Great King of <HI>England,</HI> my Master, for their Father. He hath ordered and impowered me to take care of all his dutiful and good Children the <HI>Indians,</HI> in these Parts. I do on my Side, keep this Council Room free from all Defilement. There is nothing allowed to come here which will hurt any good and honest <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I consider the Distance you are come, the severe Season of the Year, and the extream Badness of the Roads, and also, that there is a great Meeting of the <HI>Susquehanna Indians</HI> now holding under my Direction, with Mr. <HI>Creghan,</HI> my Deputy, at <HI>Harris</HI>'s-<HI>Ferry,</HI> on the <HI>Susqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hanna</HI> River, so much nearer than this to your Habitations; I could, from Brotherly Ten|derness, have wished you had deferred your Journey here, till that Meeting had been over. You would then have had a more pleasant Time, and com|fortable Roads for travelling&mdash;Besides, the Result of that Meeting would have afforded you more Matter for this: However, I take your coming now, as a strong Proof of your Brotherly Love and Friendly Dispositions towards your Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> To this Council Room, I now heartily bid you welcome. <HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Last Summer I held a Meeting, and entered into a Treaty in this Coun|cil Room, with the <HI>Shawanese</HI> King, now present; and with the King of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> settled at <HI>Tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">go.</HI> This Treaty I sent Home to the Great King, your Father; here it is printed, that all your <HI>Brethren,</HI> the <HI>English,</HI> on this Continent, may know what past; and what Agreements we have
<PB N="6" REF="007925_0005_1030152EEA603888">
entered into. The Great GOD above is a Lover of Truth and Sincerity, he will send his Vengeance down on that People or Nation who deceive each other with Words of Peace and Friendship, when their Hearts speak War, and their Tongues utter Lies. You will find that the <HI>English</HI> will faithfully observe their Parts of this Treaty; and I hope, and doubt not, but your People will strictly observe the Engagements they solemnly bound themselves to. By this Belt I expect all you who are now present, will do the same on your Parts. <HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Some of you <HI>Mohickanders</HI> were present at this Treaty, and as I make no Doubt but all of you are acquainted with the Particulars of it, I shall therefore only put you in Mind, that it was their promised to send and invite all the <HI>Shawanese</HI> who live on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and all the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mohickan|ders</HI> who are scattered round about Fort <HI>Du Quesne,</HI> and those Parts, to come and put their Hands into the same Covenant Chain.</P>
<P>I desire to know what has been done in this Affair.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Listen, and I will tell you the Difference between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> desire and labour to unite all <HI>Indians</HI> into one general Bond of brotherly Love, and national Interest. The <HI>French</HI> endeavour to divide the <HI>Indians,</HI> and stir up War and Contention amongst them. Those who intend to destroy or enslave any People or Nation, will first endeavour to divide them.&mdash;This you and all the <HI>Indians</HI> upon this Continent, know, has always been, and continues to be, the Endeavours of the <HI>French.</HI> But thoug this is a Fact which I think all the <HI>Indians</HI> must certainly see, yet the <HI>French</HI> have found Means some how or other, so to bewitch their Un|derstandings, as to make many of them believe they love the <HI>Indians,</HI> and mean well towards them. 'Tis very strange, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that any one Man, much more any Number of Men, who are not either mad or drunk, can be|lieve that stirring up Brethren to spill each others Blood, dividing them from one another, and making Parties amongst them, are Proofs of Love, and Marks of friendly Designs towards them.</P>
<P>Not less unaccountable is it, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> should be able to persuade the <HI>Indians,</HI> that building Forts in the Middle of their Country and Hunting Grounds, is for their Interest and Protection. I tell you, <HI>Brethren,</HI> and I warn you, that whatever good Words the <HI>French</HI> may give you&mdash; how much soever they may now smile on you&mdash;whatever Presents they may now make you, your Chains are in their Pockets, and when their De|signs are ripe for Execution, they will take the Axe out of their Bosom and strike it into your Heads&mdash;But this they know they cannot do until you have broken the Covenant Chain with your Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and taken up the Axe against them. 'Tis for this Reason the <HI>French</HI> are always endea|vouring, by Lies, by Presents, by Promises, to stir up all <HI>Indians</HI> to fall upon the <HI>English</HI> Settlements, to destroy their best Friends and faithful Bre|thren; and many <HI>Indians</HI> have been so wicked and foolish, as in Spight of Treaties and ancient Friendship, to become the Dogs of the <HI>French,</HI> and come and go as they commanded them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Indians</HI> do not return to their Senses, they will see and feel when it is too late, that they have ruined themselves, enslaved their Posterity, and lost their Country&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007925_0006_103015306C5146A0">They will find their Country fortified by the <HI>French,</HI> not against the <HI>English,</HI> but against the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>What I have said, and am going to say, I say not to you only, but to all <HI>Indians</HI>; and I desire you will with this Belt, make it known amongst all the Nations you have any Acquaintance or Connections with. Tell them from me, to look at the <HI>French</HI> Forts built and building through the Middle of their Country, and on their best hunting Lands&mdash;Let them look at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ags flying in their Forts at all the great Lakes, along all the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Rivers, in order to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge them to trade with the <HI>French</HI> only, sell their Skins, and take Goods for them at what Prices the <HI>French</HI> please to put on them&mdash;And it is a Thing well known to all <HI>Indians,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> cannot sell them Goods near as cheap as the <HI>English</HI> can, nor in such Assort|ments and Plenty. <HI>Gave a large Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Let a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> know, that the Great King of <HI>England,</HI> my Master, is their Friend; that he desires all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> may unite to|gether, be as one Body and one Blood&mdash;He offers them his Alliance and Protection, which all Princes and People over the great Lake, are proud and glad of. He is ready to forgiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all that has past, and receive them with the open and tender Arms of a forgiving Father, and a sincere Friend &mdash;He exho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts them by me, to take off the Bandage from their Eyes, where|with the <HI>French</HI> hath blindfolded them, that they may see the true State of their Country, and avoid the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ins which the <HI>French</HI> are preparing for them and their Posterity&mdash;Let them rise up as one Man, and assist His Majesty's Arms, in driving the <HI>French</HI> out of their Country.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Great King of <HI>England</HI> will then take Care that His People shall not invade your Lands, that His Traders shall supply you with Goods, and deal honestly by you.&mdash;</P>
<P>If the <HI>Indians</HI> will do their Parts herein, they and the <HI>English</HI> will be as one Flesh and one Blood, and every <HI>Indian</HI> on this Continent may then fit under his Tree in Peace, praise him that ruleth above,&mdash;smoke his Pipe, and dread no Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Let what I have now said to you, sink into your Hearts&mdash;publish it Word for Word to all your People at Home, and through all the Nations; make no Delay, for now is the Time for the <HI>Indians</HI> to chuse, whether they and their Children after them, will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will not be, a Free, a Great, and a Happy People.</P>
<P>By this Belt I fasten all the Words I have said to you on your Hearts. <HI>Gave a great Belt of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I would be glad to have the Opinion of you who are present, upon what I have said with these two Belts, and the Proposal I have made of its being published through the Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I must inform you of an Accident which happened some Days ago, be|tween <HI>Albany</HI> and <HI>Schen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctady.</HI> A <HI>River,</HI> or <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ckander Indian,</HI> was shot by a Soldier; who says the <HI>Indian</HI> first laid hold of him, abused and threatened him. The Soldier is in Confinement, will be tried, and if found guilty, will suffer. I am very sorry for this Misfortune, but there is no re|calling the Dead. All therefore that I can do, is to condole with you on
<PB N="8" REF="007925_0007_102E02E81947C188">
this Occasion according to your Customs, and cover his Grave with these Blankets, Strouds and Stockings; and with these Handkerchiefs to dry up the Tears of his Friends and Relations. And I hope, that after this, as the Soldier is confined, you will rest easy and satisfied in your Minds, as no|thing more could be done if the same Accident had happened to me.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As I was co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing this Way, I called at <HI>Aughguaga.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> of that Place understanding I was to pass by your House, told me that they had a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssage to send by me to you, which was this: That the <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Mohickander Indians</HI> now here, called upon the <HI>Aughguages,</HI> and invited them to accom|pany them down hither, which the <HI>Aughguages</HI> agreed to, and were pack|ing up in order to follow those <HI>Indians,</HI> but the Weather grew so bad, and raised the Creeks so high, that they became impassable; besides which, a Sickness came among their People These Accidents put a Stop to their Intentions They desired me to tell you, <HI>Brother,</HI> that howsoever these <HI>Indians</HI> may be disposed, the <HI>Aughguages</HI> are steady and firm in their At|tachments towards their Brethren the <HI>English</HI>&mdash;they added further, that though they have not yet given you an Answer upon several Belts you have sent them, they desire you will not be displeased or uneasy on this Account, for they will take Care, that their Actions shall always prove they are worthy of your Friendship and Confidence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aughguages</HI> gave me another Reason for their not coming to this Meeting&mdash;that they have lately received a Message from two of the <HI>Oneida</HI> Chiefs, named <HI>Conoghguiesa,</HI> and <HI>Teughsaniunt,</HI> acquainting them that their Country was now in Danger, as the <HI>French</HI> threatened to come that Way as soon as the Lakes were navigable; wherefore they desired all their Friends living at <HI>Aughguaga,</HI> to be ready to come to their Assistance when called upon. This they say they are ready to do, and after that is over, they will be ready to come to the Council Fire here.</P>
<P>Thus, Brother, I have acquitted myself of the Message delivered to me, for you.</P>

<P>The <HI>Shawanese, Nanticoke</HI> and <HI>Mohikander Indians,</HI> being assembled in the Meeting Room, sent Sir <HI>William</HI> Word they were come to give their An|swer to his Speech to them the <HI>Nineteenth</HI> Instant. Upon his taking his Seat, <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the <HI>Mohickander,</HI> spoke in <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>If you are prepared to hear us, please to listen to what we have to say:</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007925_0008_102E02EA4FF61328">Sir <HI>William</HI> said he was ready, and would be attentive.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are very much obliged to you for your kind Reception of us, and your Concern for the bad Journey we have had; we were not discouraged thereby, having our Hearts cheared with the Peace and Friendship our People made here with you last Summer. <HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You asked us what was done about sending your Belt to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and the <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> about Fort <HI>Du Quesne.</HI> We acknowledge that Belt was received, and it was given to <HI>Teediuscunt,</HI> the Chief Man at <HI>Tiaogo,</HI> (who is acquainted with all our Friends and Allies) what he hath done there|in, we do not really know. <HI>Gave three Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You put us in Mind of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship entered into in this Council Room last Summer, between you and our Brothers th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Delawares,</HI> at <HI>Tiaogo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>All the Nations here present for themselves, and all belonging to them, lay hold of the said Covenant Chain, and are determined to keep fast the same as long as the Sun Shines, and GOD gives us Breath.</P>
<P>You have told us, Brother, that GOD knows all Things, and the Heart of every one of US. Brother, 'tis true, and we call GOD to Witness the Sincerity of our Resolutions, to keep unbroken, the Covenant Chain, with our Brethren the <HI>English</HI>: We will not tell you any Lies, and we assure you, that when our People at Home, shall hear of our entering into this Agree|ment of Peace and Friendship, they will, we are sure, be exceedingly re|joiced; and we will not only faithfully observe it ourselves, but teach the same to our Children yet unborn. <HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>All you said to us concerning the Difference of Conduct between the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> and every Thing you desired us to publish amongst our People, and all the Nations, gave us great Satisfaction; and we think it to be the Truth. Be assured, we will not do as was done last Year, refer it to another, but we will deliver your Words, and send your Belt, with our own Mouths and Hands; and when we have done this, we will not fail to let you know what Effects it has had, and what Nations you can depend upon as Brethren; and what are your Enemies. <HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told us the Day before Yesterday, that the <HI>French</HI> had put a Bandage over our Eyes, which you told us to remove, that we might look about and see clearly the State of our Country, and our true Interest</P>
<P>All you said to us on this Subject, was extreamly agreeable, and we thank you for it from the Bottom of our Hearts; it was acting like a Friend and Brother: But for our Parts, we have cast off the Bandage, and can see clearly round us, and which Way soever we look, we can see no Friends so true, no Brothers so affectionate to us as the <HI>English</HI>; they have ever been so to us, and our Fore-fathers also.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have also told us, that the Great King, our Father, over the Sea, offered us, by you, his Hand of Favour and Protection; we lay fast hold of it, and will not quit it so long as the World endures.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007925_0009_102E02EBEBA28840">
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made us very joyful, by assuring us, that our Father, the Great King, is ready to forgive and forget all past Faults and Misdoing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash; this makes our Hearts happy and easy, for there have been some <HI>Indians</HI> who have done am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o thought He would never forgive them.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We beg Leave to add a few Words; we have not perhaps been so particu|lar as we ought,&mdash;but we assure you, that what we have said, comes from the Bottom of our Hearts; and that we mean more and better than we are capable of expressing&mdash;In these Matters we are but as Children to you white People.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have forgot something, that is, to tell you where we now live; it is at <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingo</HI>; and if you have at any Time, Occasion for us, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Messages to send us, there you will always find us.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told us two Days ago, that when a Man is dead, there is no bring|ing him to Life again. <HI>Brother,</HI> We understand there are two <HI>Indians</HI> in jail at <HI>Albany,</HI> accused of killing a Man; they are alive, and may live to be of Service, and we beg you, in the Name of the Great King, our Fa|ther, that they may be released.

<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> told them, that as it was now late, he proposed To-morrow to say something more to them; and give an Answer upon some Things they had now said.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FORT-JOHNSON, 22</HI>d April, <HI>1757.</HI> PRESENT, as Yesterday. Sir <HI>WILLIAM JOHNSON</HI>'s Second <HI>SPEECH</HI> to the aforesaid INDIANS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT you said to me Yesterday, in Answer to my former Speech to you, was very agreeable and pleasing to me; I look upon your Words as a Tree in full Blossom, which I hope and expect will produce Fruit suitable to its Appearance.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Let me again put you in Mind of the Belt I have given you, and which you have promised to show to all those Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> with whom you have any Acquaintance or Friendship; and to repeat what I have told you. As I think those Things are of great Consequence to the Welfare of all <HI>In|dians,</HI> I will again mention the Heads of what I said upon my second and third Belts, in my former Speech. [Which he did, and then added three particular Instances, in which their Friendship and Alliance with the <HI>English,</HI> was greatly more for their Interest, than with the <HI>French.</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> That in Case their Crops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed, and they were destitute of Provisions, that they could be easily relieved by their Neighbourhood to the <HI>English</HI>; whereas they were at such a Distance from <HI>Canada,</HI> that they might starve before they could get Relief from the <HI>French.</HI> 2<HI>dly.</HI> That in Case they were in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of Ammunition or Assistance against an Enemy, they might be all de|stroyed before they could obtain the needful Assistance from the <HI>French.</HI> 3<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly.</HI> the same Consequences with Regard to Trade.]</P>
<P>With this Bunch of Wampum I fix firmer upon your Hearts and Memories, my Talk and Advice to you. <HI>Gave a large Bunch of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Last Night I wrote to the Earl of LO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">DOUN, who commands all the King's Soldiers in this Country, and to Sir CHARLES HARDY, Governor of this Province, concerning the Request you made of having your People discharged, who are now in <HI>Alba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Jail: It is not in my Power to give them free, but I dare say those great Men will comply with your Desire, if the Circumstances of the Affair appear to be such, as Reason and Justice will permit it to be done. <HI>Gave a Bunch of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you have now, in Behalf of yourselves and all your People, laid hold of the Covenant Chain of Peace and Friendship with the Great King of <HI>England,</HI> my Master, and called the Great GOD above to witness, that you do sincerely intend, and firmly resolve&punc; that you will hereafter behave to all his Subjects as fast Friends and loving Brethren; into which Covenant Chain I have taken you all, your Wives and Children&mdash;Therefore, lest you may have forgot what was meant by the Covenant Chain, in old Times, I will briefly remind you of its Obligations.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Indians,</HI> your Fore-fathers, first made this Covenant Chain with the <HI>English</HI>&mdash;both Parties engaged to keep the Ends of it fast in their Hands&mdash;that they would take great Care to keep it from breaking, or from getting any Rust or Filth upon it&mdash;that they would be as one Flesh and one Blood, so that if any Enemy should intend to hurt or strike one Party,
<PB N="12" REF="007925_0011_103014F959A72768">
the other should immediately give him Notice, rise up and help him; and that a good Road should always be kept open between their Habitations, that when they might call for each other's Assistance, they could easily and speedily come.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the Road between us hath been open last Year, by which Means all Logs and Stones which were in the Way, hath been removed, and made broad, safe and pleasant: We shall on our Parts keep it so, and I expect you'll do the same on yours.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have informed me, that you three Nations are settled at <HI>Otsiningo,</HI> and that there I may always find you. You have lived in too dispersed a Manner; which must naturally weaken a People, and make them of little Consequence; whereas if you keep together in one Body, you may be strong and respectable.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this Belt I girt your Loins round, after the Manner of Warriors, that whenever you are called upon, you may be ready to run along this good Road, to assist us your <HI>Brethren,</HI> if any Enemy may be coming to hurt them; and we shall do the same by you, when you have any Occasion to call upon us: By this Means we shall become a strong Body, and nothing will be able to hurt us. <HI>Gave a very large Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have but a few Words more to say to you, and then I shall conclude: If you hear of any News, which concerns the Safety or Welfare of us your <HI>Brethren,</HI> I expect you will give us immediate Notice; and we shall do the same by you. <HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Time of the Year, the Severity of the Season, and my having of late been obliged to be so much from Home, and that I did not expect you so soon, has prevented my having as great a Plenty of Goods as I usually have; however, I shall look about, and when all Business is finished, I hope to find a small Present for you. So ended this Meeting.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FORT-JOHNSON, 23</HI>d April, <HI>1757.</HI> A. M. The <HI>REPLY</HI> of the aforesaid <HI>Indians,</HI> to Sir <HI>WILLIAM JOHNSON</HI>'S SPEECH to them Yesterday. PRESENT, as before.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>If you are ready to hear us, we shall make some Reply to what you Yesterday said to us.</P>
<P>Sir WILLIAM answered, he was ready; when the Speaker proceeded:</P>
<P>BROTHER,</P>
<P>YOU told us Yesterday, that you looked on what we had said, and the Assurances we had given you, as a Tree in Blossom, and that you hoped it would yield good Fruit.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We like the Comparison&mdash;we have spoke to you from our Hearts, and
<PB N="13" REF="007925_0012_1030153F0BF8F4E8">
we hope good Fruit will come from thence. On our Parts, we truly mean what our Tongue hath spoken, and we doubt not, but you will, on your Side, be as a fruitful Tree to us. <HI>Gave two Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have repeated to us, and we shall not forget it, the different Behavi|our of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> towards the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ians</HI>; and you gave us Instan|ces, to prove, that it was greatly mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e our Interest to keep Friends with the Former than the Latter. <HI>Brother,</HI> what you have said hereon, we are convinced is the Truth; and we thank you heartily for pointing out to us our true Interest and Welfare: What you have said, has made our Hearts light within us, and we will not forget it. <HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told us that last Year you had opened the Road between our Habi|tations and the <HI>English,</HI> and that you believed we had found nothing bad in this Road. (<HI>The Speaker here repeated what Sir</HI> William <HI>had said to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m Yesterday with the large Belt.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have now renewed the Covenant Chain, with all its Obligations agreed on between our respective Fore-fathers.</P>
<P>We are extreamly glad that you have made the Road open between us, and it is a very pleasant one.</P>
<P>We are thankful to you for tying up our Blankets, and whenever you call upon us, we shall be ready to stand up and come without Delay; and we shall from this Day forward, consider the <HI>English</HI> and Ourselves as one Body, one Head, and one Mind. <HI>Gave a belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have desired, that whenever we hear any Thing which may concern the Interest or Welfare of our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> we should without Delay communicate it. You may depend that we will do this; and if we get any Intelligence, though it should be in the Middle of the Night, we will send off an Express to you. Some of our young People are generally on the Hunt, and are very likely to make Discoveries.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are very thankful for your Promise to do the same by us, and to be ready to come to our Assistance in Case of Need. <HI>Gave three Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>What you have told us concerning your writing to the Great Men about our Friends in <HI>Albany</HI> Jail, we have put into our Hearts, and when we see our said Brothers safe in Freedom, it will be a convincing Proof to us, that we are indeed <HI>Brethren</HI> and one People with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is all we have to say, and from this Time forth, we are as one Body.</P>
<P>Then the Sachems and Chiefs of the three Nations, with the Speaker, came and shook Hands with Sir <HI>William,</HI> and the several Gentlemen present, with great Appearance of Joy and Sincerity.</P>
<P>The Speaker rose up again, and said,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have forgot something of Consequence, which we desire may be wrote down.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007925_0013_103015430EC0BFA8">
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are now become, as was said, One-People: Whenever, therefore, your People and ours may meet in the Woods or elsewhere, we expect they shall shake Hands and smoke together as loving <HI>Brethren</HI>: And as we shall on our Parts, publish all that hath past here, to all our absent People and Friends, we hope, and desire you will do the same to yours, that none may be ignorant, that from this Day forward, and forever, we are Brothers, Friends and Allies; and engaged on all Occasions, to love and assist each other.</P>
<P>A few Words more we beg Leave to say, and then we have done.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI> (holding up a Belt)</P>
<P>Last Spring with this Belt, the <HI>Nanticokes</HI> took us by the Hand, and bid us set down by them; They said to us,
<Q>You <HI>Mohickanders</HI> and we <HI>Nanti|cokes</HI> will be one People, and take you <HI>Mohickanders</HI> by the Hand as Bre|thren, and fix you here at <HI>Otsiningo,</HI> where the <HI>Six-Nations</HI> have lighted a Council Fire, and the <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecas</HI> appointed Land for you to cultivate; call all your dispersed Brethren together, and sit down here with them as their Habitation; and we <HI>Nanticokes</HI> assure you, that whoever shall pinch or hurt you, we will feel it, and the <HI>Six-Nations</HI> will do the same.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This Belt we propose to send amongst all our dispersed People. We have acquainted you herewith, that whenever you see any of our scattered People passing up the River, you may know that they are removing to <HI>Otsiningo.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> said, <HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am quite pleased with the Conduct of the <HI>Nanticokes,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> think it a very prudent Measure; it will strengthen them: And you three Nations together, may be a considerable and flourishing People.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As I expect all that has past here between us, will be printed; by that Means it will be known throughout this, and the neighbouring Govern|ments.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>William</HI> had done, the Kings or Chiefs of each Nation, rose up and made a strong Exhortation to all their People present, to remember every Thing which had past at this Meeting; and to consider it as done in the Presence of Him who sitteth above, and seeth all Things.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> recommended it to them, to make such an equal and upright Division of the Presents intended for them, (which he proposed to deliver to them in the Afternoon) as none might have just Cause to murmur, or be dis|satisfied.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> present at <HI>Fort-Johnson,</HI> during the above Meet|ing, were given in by the <HI>Interpreter,</HI> as follows:
