<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Ecclesiastes 11. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Rejoyce O Young man in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the dayes of thy Youth, and walk in the Wayes of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes; but know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these words we have (1.) An <HI>Ironical Concession.</HI> Do thou (faith So|lomon) who art a young man live as Merry as heart can with: Indulge thy self in the most Vicious Courses and see what will come of it, or on thee for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. He had just before intimated that lise in this world is but short, and then a long Eternity fol|loweth. <HI>If a man live many years and re|joyce in them all, yet let him remember the dayes of darkness for they shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> The long|est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon Earth, is here but a very short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> compared with the days which his

Body must be in the dark Grave, and if he continueth walking in the way of his Heart and in the sight of his Eyes) his Soul in a darker Hell. The use which an <HI>Atheist</HI> on an <HI>Epicure</HI> would make of this Doctrine concerning the brevity of mans life, is, Then let us live a short life and a merry, let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall dy. Do so (saith Solomon) do so Young man, and see what you will bring your self unto at last. He doth not speak in earnest, but in an holy disdain. His words are like those of the Prophet unto Ahab, whose heart was set upon going to fight against the Syrians hoping to come off a Conquerer, <HI>Go and prosper</HI> (saith he) <HI>for the Lord shall deliver thy enemies into thy hands;</HI> when as he in|tended the contrary. Thus doth Solomon by way of Irony and Derision permit young men to do that which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> most willingly and commonly practise. Therefore (2.) The Latter part of the words read, contain a sad and serious Admonition unto Young men. <HI>Know</HI> young man <HI>that for all these things, h. e.</HI> for all the Sins, Vanities, and Extravaganes of thy youth, <HI>God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> Thou shalt one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brought before the Tribunal of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God, there to have thy <HI>Trial;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

in thy sinful Courses, a dismal day will it be unto thee: Thou shalt be Condemned and Punished for all that thou hast done in Compliance with the ways of thy heart, and the sight of thy eyes. So then the <HI>Doctrine</HI> now before us, is,
<Q><HI>That Young Men who Continue to Walk in the Wayes of their Heart, and in the Sight of their Eyes, will have a sad account to give to God, at the day of Judgment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Particulars contained in this Doctrine may be set before us in several <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<P><HI>Propos.</HI> I. <HI>Men ought not to walk in the wayes of their Heart, &amp; in the sight of their Eyes.</HI> There is in the Scripture an express Prohi|bition to the contrary; which is (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Learned Interpreter has well and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Observed) a cleer demonstration that Solo|mon doth not speak in earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Ironically,</HI> when he bids young men walk in the ways of their heart and in the sight of their eyes. Otherwise Solomon would contradict Moses, who saith; <HI>seek ye not after your own Heart, and your own Eyes, after which you use to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">?</HI> Numb. 15. 39. Nor are these ex|pressions ever used in the Scripture in a good sense. The way of the heart and sight, of 
<PB N="8" REF="000728_0008_0FAA45476BC181F0">
the eyes of men, is always evil. But the Truth of the Proposition before us is further evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that Original sin hath depraved the whole man. It is a woful Leprosy whereby every member of the body, and all the powers of the soul are tainted and disorder|ed. The heart is put for the most excel|lent faculties wherewith the Souls of men are adorned. Sometimes for the mind or understanding. Now sin has defiled and depraved that power of the rational Soul. <HI>The mind and Conscience</HI> (which is the practi|cal understanding, or the Soul reflecting upon it self and judging of a mans own ways) these are <HI>defiled,</HI> Tit. 1. 15. Therefore men are apt to Judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be Truth, and evil to be good, the light in them is darkness, and how great is that darkness? So that if they walk after the blind dictates of their own dark and deluded understand|ing, they may miserably perish. Sometimes <HI>the heart</HI> is put for the <HI>will and affections,</HI> which are also corrupted and perverted by Adams fall and original sin. Hence men do naturally chuse and delight in those things which the Lord abhors. Zech. 8. 17. <HI>Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against your neighbours, and love no false Oath, for all these 
<PB N="9" REF="000728_0009_0FAA454820190A80">
things I hate, saith the Lord.</HI> So then the things which God hates, the vile and car|nal hearts of men love and embrace. And as the chief powers of the Soul, so the most excellent members of the Body are vitiated by sin. The eye is the most excellent mem|ber of the body, but it is now a very sinfull member. The Scripture does therefore speak of <HI>Eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot cease from sin.</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. The natural Inclinations of the hearts of men are corrupt and evil inclinations. The hearts of men are naturally averse from and indisposed unto that which is good. They have neither wit nor will for a good matter. Jer. 4 22. <HI>They are sottish Children, they have none understanding, they are wise to do e|vil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</HI> That which the Prophet there speaks, concerning the Jews, is no less true of all men considered as what they are by nature. Heart does answer Heart, as in the water, Face does ans|wer Face. The Jews spoke what was in their hearts, when they said unto the Pro|phet, as for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, <HI>We will not hearken to thee.</HI> Jer. 44. 16. Let a good moti|on be presented, and the carnal heart can find an hundred Excuses, Evasions, and Ob|jections 
<PB N="10" REF="000728_0010_0FAA454C9394EC98">
against it; but let an evil motion present it self, and the heart is ready to close with it immediately. Sinners are not only <HI>uninclined</HI>to that which is good, but woful|ly inclined unto that which is evil. Eccles. 8. 11. Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore <HI>the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</HI> The heart of a sinner is wickedly bent. 'Tis set for evil, nay <HI>fully</HI> set to do evil. The truth is (and a sad truth it is) there is no e|vil so bad, no sin so abominable, but there is a natural propensity in the Unregenerate heart to close with it. Well does the Scrip|ture say, that the heart of man (and what worse could be said of the heart of a Devil) is <HI>deceitful above all things, and desperately wick|ed.</HI> Jer. 17. 9. 'Tis not only false, but deceit|full above all things; not only a subject of sin, but wicked and desperately so. There is not an Unregenerate man in the world, but if the Holy God should wholly remove from him the restraints of His Grace and Providence, and give him up to the natural inclinations of his own heart; there is no wickedness so great, no sin so bloody, but he would soon become guilty of it. Therefore the Apostle speaking concerning what men are by nature; he saith, <HI>their feet are swift 
<PB N="11" REF="000728_0011_0FAA454D3AF44130">
to shed blood,</HI> Rom. 3. 15. Every man has by nature the heart of a Murderer in him. Is he not subject to rash and undue anger? That's a degree of Murder, and would end there, did not special or common Grace prevent it. From this consideration it was that an holy man when he heard of any prodigious wickedness done by the vilest sons of Beli|al (suppose Blasphemy, Sorcery, Adultery, Murder) would strike upon his breast and say, In this Heart of mine is that which would have caused me to have been guilty of the same evil, if the Grace of God had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> made a difference. Yea, such is the depravation of mens nature, as that their hearts are set upon an evil the rather and the more because God has forbidden it. The Heathen could observe that there is such a perverse Temper and Inclination in men. They could say, <HI>Nitimur in vetitum semper,</HI> men are always desiring forbidden fruit. Truly since the sin of Adam, it has ever been so. The holy Apostle was very sensible of this; we hear him bewailing it sadly. Rom. 7. 8. <HI>Sin taking Occasion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">piscence.</HI> So it was with him before his Conversion, be|cause the Commandment said, ye shall not do such a thing, he was the more set upon 
<PB N="12" REF="000728_0012_0FAA454ECC826098">
doing it. There is many an Unregenerate man that would not do such and such things, did not God in His Word say, ye shall not do them. I remember <HI>Austin</HI> in his Con|fession, mourns over the Corruption of his nature in this respect. He saith, that when he was an ungodly Youth, he did sometimes Steal Apples out of his Neighbours Orchard, when he might take as many as he desired of the very same sort of Apples in his fathers Orchard, but where he might have them without sin he cared not for them, only in a place where he could not come by them without transgressing the eighth Command|ment; his eyes and heart were set upon the forbidden fruit. The truth is, that no in|clinations besides what have sin attending them are natural to the carnal hearts of men. If there be good Inclinations, they are Su|penatural. <HI>For I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.</HI> Rom. 7. 18. Since it is thus, men ought not to walk after the inclinations of their own hearts.</P>
<P N="3">3. The thoughts and Imaginations of the heart of a sinner are vain and vile. Job 11. 12. <HI>Vain man would be wise, though man is born like a wild Asses Colt.</HI> Men bring hearts into the world with them that are full of Vanity. They are born foolish Creatures. 
<PB N="13" REF="000728_0013_0FAA454EE6317F10">
Therefore has the wise man said, that <HI>Fool|ishness is bound in the heart of a Child,</HI> Prov. 22. 15. A Child carries a bundle up and down with him wherever he goes, and this bundle in his heart. But a bundle of what? Truly, a bundle of folly. Children can no sooner exercise their thoughts about any matter, but there are a world of foolish Imaginati|ons naturally springing up in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. And as they grow up from child hood unto youth, and from youth unto man-hood, their Imaginations are vain still, yea, as vain as Vanity it self; the Lord knoweth that it is so. Psal. 94. 11. <HI>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are Vanity.</HI> The thoughts of young men in a peculiar manner are very vain. Gen. 8. 21. <HI>The Imaginations of mans heart is evil from his youth.</HI> It cannot be ex|pressed what an Infinite number of vain thoughts and imaginations are in the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of poor Unconverted youth: his heart i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> like a Mint which is always framing and coyning vain Imaginations. Atheistica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thoughts are the foolishest that can be Imagi|ned. Yet his vain heart is full of them. He Imagineth that God does not observe him so as to bring him into Judgment, that those he sinneth he shall escape Punishment. Deu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 29. 19. <HI>It shall come to pass if when he heareth 
<PB N="14" REF="000728_0014_0FAA454FA056EA58">
the words of this Curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the Imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst; the Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his Iea|lousy shall smoke against that man.</HI> Thus are sinners apt vainly to Imagine that they shall have peace though they walk in the ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hearts, notwithstanding God has said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> He will make His anger to smoke against them. Not only <HI>Vain</HI> but <HI>Vile</HI> thoughts are natural to the sinful hearts of men. Unclean thoughts, Revengful thoughts. Bloody and Blasphemous thoughts; if there were no Devil to Tempt them or to cast such thoughts into their minds, their hearts would naturally of themselves produce them. <HI>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False Witness, Blasphemies.</HI> Math. 15. 19.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Byes of men are oftentimes an Occasion, and an inlet to very much sin. David was very Sensible of this, and it had been well for him if he had alwayes remem|bred it. The knowledge and sense of this truth in his heart, made him pray as in Psal. 119. 37. <HI>Turn away mine eyes from behold|ing Vanity.</HI> The eyes are the windows through which many sins creep into the heart. 
<PB N="15" REF="000728_0015_0FAA4550895C7FE8">
No sooner do's a sinful eye behold any thing which is vain, but the corrupt heart is stirred up to lust after it. Holy Job made a covenant with his eyes, and he would not suffer <HI>his heart to walk after his eyes.</HI> Job 31. 1, 7. But the heart of an Unregenerate un|holy man does walk after his eyes. He is led by sense and not by right reason, or by Religion. Where sin bears rule (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the hearts of all that are in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> estate) sense bears rule too, and does Cap|tivate the Will, Affections, Understanding and all, so as that which way soever the eye goeth the heart walks after it. Though sin is Originally in the heart, 'tis there before it is in the eye; nevertheless, the eye allures the heart, and occasions the stirrings of that Corruption which is there as the fountain of sin. There are very pernicious evils which get into the heart by the eye: when once the eye le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s them in, the heart is like tinder to sparks of fire presently inflamed, The eye does occasion the heart to become guilty of Uncleannesses in the sight of God. Josephs Mistress <HI>Cast her eyes upon him,</HI> and then her ungodly heart was inflamed with wicked desires. Gen. 39. 7. When Achan <HI>saw</HI> a goodly Babylonish Garment, and two hundred shekels of Silver, and a wedge of 
<PB N="16" REF="000728_0016_0FAA45512227AED0">
Gold, <HI>then he Coveted them,</HI> Josh. 7. 21. Co|veteous desires after Silver or Gold or Goods, or any thing which is another mans, are ac|casioned by the sight of the eyes. Hence Coveteousness is called <HI>The Lust of the Eye.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 16. because the sight of the eyes blowes up Covetous desires. Wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> (and in particular young men) ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> careful not to walk after the sight of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> This notwithstanding, The Second <HI>Proposition</HI> before us, is,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<P>Propos. II <HI>That Young Men whose na|tures are not changed by the Regenerating Grace of God, Walk in the ways of their Heart and in the sight of their Eyes.</HI> It is true that a|mongst Unconverted young men there is a great difference: All are not alike as to Vi|ciousness. There are young men that have been kept from Scandalous sins all their days, who are nevertheless in their natural estate, strangers to a work of Regeneration. Such a young man do we read of in the Gospel, who came to Christ desiring to know what good thing he should do that he might have Eternal Life: when the Lord said to him, keep the Commandments, thou shalt do no Murthen thou shalt not Commit Adultery, thou shalt not Steal, thou shalt not bear false 
<PB N="17" REF="000728_0017_0FAA4551E32C0B28">
Witness, Honour thy Father and thy Mo|ther, <HI>the young man said unto him, all these things have I kept from my youth up,</HI> Math. 19. 20. And yet that Young man had not saving Grace in his soul: he wanted that one thing ne|cessary unto Salvation: he loved the world more then he loved Christ: he had not Faith, and therefore could not overcome the World: he would rather part with Christ; and loose eternal life, than part with his e|state when the Lord called for it. And such a Young man was Paul whilest he was yet in his natural estate: No man could accuse him with any Scandalous sin; nor could he accuse himself: he had lived honestly ac|cording to the Religion in the which he had been Educated: he could say to the Coun|cil, <HI>I have lived in all good Conscience before God until this day,</HI> Acts 23. 1. And he tells the Philippians that touching the Righteousness which is in the Law he was blameless: This notwithstanding, had he dyed in that estate he must have perished Eternally. But al|though an Unconverted Person may be free from Scandalous Immoralities in the sight of men, yet he does indulge himself in some lust or other, some way of his own heart; some sin or other does not only at Times prevaile over him (as it may be with a true 
<PB N="18" REF="000728_0018_0FAA4552B406E0D0">
believer) but has a <HI>standing power</HI> and do|minion over him. And there are evils which Youth is in a peculiar manner subject unto. Hence is that caution, 2 Tim. 2. 22. <HI>Flee youthful Lusts.</HI> h. e. those Lusts which Young men more than others are generally addicted unto. We see this also in that ex|pression of the Psalmist, <HI>Wherewith shall a Young man cleanse his way.</HI> Psal. 119. 9. Intimating that the ways of Young men are commonly Unclean, Unholy ways, <HI>wayes of their own heart,</HI> very impure in the sight of God who will bring them into Judgment. The Con|fessions and Supplications made by holy men long after their Conversion do likewise ma|nifest this. Job bitterly Complains of <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his Youth.</HI> Chap. 13. v. 26. And Da|vid prayeth, that the Lord would not re|member <HI>the sins of his Youth,</HI> nor his trans|gressions. Psal. 25. 7.</P>
<P>The Enquiry here may be, 
<Q><HI>What are those Ways of their own Heart which Unregenerate Young Men use to Walk in?</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. The way of Pride is the way of a mans own heart. Man is naturally e|ver since Adam sinned a proud Creature. The Devil who is made up of Pride, infused that poyson into Adams heart. When once 
<PB N="19" REF="000728_0019_0FAA4554D1DB8C68">
the Serpent of hell had bitten him, his heart was swollen with Pride: and Adam did propagate that poyson to his children: he was in the day that God Created him in the likeness of God; but when once he had sin|ned he did not beget a son in the likeness of God, but <HI>in his own likeness and after his I|mage,</HI> that is to say, he begat a Son with a proud heart like his Father. Gen. 5. 3. Nor is there any Unregenerate man, but he is under the dominion of that sin of Pride. It may be other sins may have dominion over him. Men are <HI>serving divers lusts:</HI> but whatever lust besides there may be, Pride reigns in the Unregenerate Soul. Hence such persons are in the Scripture called <HI>the Proud,</HI> Mal. 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. There is no sin more na|tural then that of Pride: We see it in chil|dren who discover that Corruption to be in them before they can speak. And this is the sin which useth to reign in Young men: if they are descended of better parents then others, they are proud of their birth and pa|rantage: if they have good natural parts, wit and memory; or acquired parts above others, they are on these accounts lifted up with pride. The Apostle faith that <HI>know|ledge puffeth up,</HI> 1 Cor. 8. 1. Where there is not Grace to keep the heart humble it does 
<PB N="20" REF="000728_0020_0FAA468EB039CB70">
so. And vain Young men do often times conceit their knowledge to be much greater then it is, not being sensible of that <HI>Abyss</HI> of Ignorance which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in their dark minds. It is from Pride that Young men do not shew that respect to their Superiours, or unto Aged ones, which God Commandeth them to do. <HI>The child will behave himself Proudly against the Ancient,</HI> Isa 3. 5. Such especially whose parts and abilities are through age de|cayed: Proud Youth dispi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth them. And hence it is that Young men regard not the Counsils and Instructions which are admini|stred to them Jer. 22. 21. I spake unto thee in thy prosperity, but thou saidst, I will not hear, <HI>this has been thy manner from thy youth,</HI> that thou obeyest not my voice. Young men are usually impatient of Advice and Re|proof; let the Reprover have never so much Authority with him, they regard it not. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> gravely reprove and admonish his Sons, he told them that he had been informed of their evil do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs, and <HI>why do you such things?</HI> But it is noted concerning those haughty young men, that <HI>they hearkned not to the voice of their father,</HI> 1 Sam 2. 25. It is from Pride that young men are not willing to be under Government: Children will not be ruled by their Parents, nor Servants by their Masters; 
<PB N="21" REF="000728_0021_0FAA468F372A40E0">
and the reason is because they are ruled by the Pride of their own hearts. An inordi|nate affectation of liberty, is the sin which reigns in Youth commonly. Whats said concerning the Young Prodigal is a discrip|tion of the spirit which useth to prevail in Unconverted Young men. He was not will|ing to continue in his Fathers Family, nor to be under his Fathers inspection and go|vernment, but would be gone into far Coun|tries. Luke 15. 12, 13. Do we not see it just so in many Young men amongst our selves? Nothing will serve them, but to be going far from their fathers house, that so they may without control walk in the way of their heart, and after the sight of their eyes. An humble and dutiful respect to their Pa|rents would make them think themselves happy in being near them Again, the Scrip|ture speaks of <HI>the Pride of Life,</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 18 Vanity in Apparel is one particular intended by that expression: for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of life dis|covers it self very much in the outward garb which persons appear in. We see daily that young people are very much addicted unto such Vanities. They are ready to follow every Proud Fashion as soon as it cometh into the Land, and it may be regard neither God nor man that shall testify against them. 
<PB N="22" REF="000728_0022_0FAA469252763A10">
Because of the bravery of their tinkling Or|naments, the Chains, and Bracelets, and chan|geable suits of Apparel, the daughters of Zion are haughty. Isa. 3. 16. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They that walk in Pride, walk in the way of their own hearts, and in the sight of their eyes. This Young People too generally do.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unruly Unmortified Passions, are the ways of a mans own heart. As for those Graces of Meekness, and Patience, and a for|bearing forgiving spirit, they do not grow in natures garden: They are Supernatural fruits produced and planted in the heart by the holy Spirit of God: but for men to be Passionate and Revengful is natural: We see it in little Children who if any one cross them, will presently strike again and revenge themselves. The carnal Unregenerate hearts of men esteem those holy Commandments which require the Mortification of Passions to be severe and unreasonable. <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate would scoff and deride the Christi|an Religion because of those holy precepts which our Saviour Christ ha's taughts His Disciples, in Math. 5. 39, 40. <HI>Resist ye not evil, but whosoever shall smite you on the right cheek, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> to him the other also. &amp;c.</HI> The Philoso|phers amongst the Gentiles have taught that in great injuries men ought to revenge them|selves, 
<PB N="23" REF="000728_0023_0FAA4693374575B8">
which is directly contrary to the ex|press word of God. Prov. 24. 29. <HI>Say not I will do to him as he has done to me, I will ren|der to him according to his work.</HI> Nothing is more natural for men then to say so, and to do so. I'le be even with him (saith the Unregenerate heart) I'le give him as good as he brings. They think it a disgrace for them to put up an afront, or to pass by an injury without revenge or satisfaction, not|withstanding the Lord chargeth them to forgive those that have done them wrong as ever they desire pardoning mercy at the hands of God. And thus it is with Young men until the Grace of God ha's made a mighty change in them: they are ruled not by the word of God, but by their own pas|sions; when once they are provoked because they have not Grace in their hearts, they cannot command their own spirits. Hence it is usual with Young men in their anger to speak rashly and wickedly. There are Young men so devoid of all fear of God and the Judgment to come, as that in their mad wrath and rage, they will Curse and Swear, and wish Damnation to themselves and others. Ungodly Young men are apt to proceed from wrathful words to revengful blows: in their passion they'l make bloody work of it.

There were a number of Young men (above Twenty of them) that every one thrust his Sword in his fellows side until they fell down together. 2 Sam. 2. 16. Sometimes their sinful anger doth degenerate into hatred and revenge: So it was with <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Absolom,</HI> wicked Young men both of them. And <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> were Young men that in their passion and revenge did a bloody fact, concerning whom their Father on his death bed said, <HI>in their anger they slew a man, Cursed be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel.</HI> Gen 49. 6, 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. When men indulge themselves in sen|sual pleasures, they walk in the way of their own hearts. The Scripture fortels (and we see it verified) that in the latter days of the world, some will be <HI>Lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God,</HI> 2 Tim. 3. 4. This is that which men do naturally: they study more how to gratify their senses than how to please a holy God. Hence the Apostle describing the natural estate of the Ephesi|ans, and so of all other men, saith, they did walk after the course of this world, <HI>fulfilling the desires of the flesh.</HI> And this is that which Young men are in a peculiar manner addict|ed unto, and their souls endangered by. <HI>Walk in the wayes of thy heart,</HI> h. e.

fill of those sensual pleasures which thy heart is set upon: this is that which Young men would have not considering that when Death and Judgement comes, those will prove bitter pleasures to them. We see that Young men for the most part are Servants, yea Slaves to some sensual lust or other: Drink and vain Company is dearer to them than the Salvation of their own Souls: And many times there is some unclean lust or other which they live in; <HI>Elibu</HI> observed concern|ing the <HI>Youth</HI> in former ages, <HI>that their life was amongst the Unclean.</HI> There are ma|ny sad instances which stand upon Record in the Book of God concerning this. <HI>Onan</HI> a Young man but abominably unclean in the sight of God, for which his wickedness the Lord flew him and sent him to hell in his youth. The sons of <HI>Eli</HI> were guilty of vile uncleanness to the great dishonour of God and of their Father also; of them it is said, that <HI>the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord,</HI> 1 Sam 2. 17. <HI>Amnon</HI> a Young man was (though the son of a very holy father) a monster of uncleanness; he set his eyes on his own Sister, and then did wickedly after the sight of his eyes, by which means he made himself one of the fools in Israel, and come to an unhappy and untimely

Thats it which Young men would be at; they are for their play and sports. As for lawful Recreations which moderately and seasonably used are good and in some cases a duty; they too often spend more time therein, then God alloweth of. And too many of them indulge themselves in sin|full sports and pastimes; and when once they have tasted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that forbidden fruit, they are inchanted and intoxicated with it so as that they can know no bounds therein. <HI>Austin</HI> relates concerning <HI>Alipius</HI> who was his Com|panion and Comrade when they were both Young men, that he was by some <HI>Vain</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to go to behold a <HI>Sword play,</HI> and he sayes, that (though he was before a very hopefull Young man) when once he had been made a Spectator in that bloody sport, he was with very much adoe recovered out of that snare.

Indeed Young men are commonly unwilling to dy, and so to come into Judg|ment: he Terrors of Death are amazing to them.

You read in the Gospel of one that said to his Soul, <HI>Soul take thine ease, eat, drink,</HI> just as if he had no more then the Soul of a Swine in him: That was a man that walk|ed in the ways of his own heart; but there is a terrible thunder clap a coming, <HI>God said unto him, thou fool, this night thy Soul shall be required of thee,</HI> Luk. 12. 19, 20.

<HI>Ecclesiastes, be not overmuch wicked, neither be you foolish, for why shouldest thou dy before thy time,</HI> Eccles. 7 17. Many years since there was a sad Occasion for me to insist on that Scripture, and to shew that excess in wick|edness brings untimely death: We have with our eyes seen woful examples of it. Especially if the Children of Godly Parents exceed in wickedness, they make hast into Hell. This we see in several of Davids Children, and in the Sons of Eli: Inasmuch as they had been brought up in such Fami|lies, but sinned heinously against the Religi|ous Education God had favoured them with, while they were Young men they became ripe for Everlasting destruction. And most of all it is so as to such as live under the Gospel: God useth to make quick work with such sinners. That Scripture relates to Gospel times, Mal. 3. 5. Where the Lord saith, He will <HI>Come near to Judgment, and that He will be a swift witness against the A|dulterers, and against the false Swearers &amp;c.</HI> If Young men that have the Gospel shall be Profane Swearers, and Unclean debauch|ed wretches, the Lord will be a swift witness against them, He will not suffer them to be long out of Hell. How rare is it to see a profane Young man that has enjoyed the

means of Grace powerfully dispensed to live unto old age? No; but God brings them to death, and when they are brought to death they are brought unto Judgment also. For Judgement follows at the heels of death. Heb. 9. 27. <HI>It is appointed unto men once to dy, and after this the Judgment.</HI> At the hour of death there is a particular Judgement passed on the Soul: The Soul of a sinner is no sooner out of his body, but the next mo|ment he knoweth most certainly where he must be, and what will become of him throughout eternal ages. Young men (as well as others) that shall dy in their sins will then be judged and condemned to per|petual Imprisonment: To lie in a <HI>Dungeon</HI> amongst hellish Serpents, where is <HI>blackness of darkness for ever.</HI> Then will the days of darkness which are many come upon them. It is said concerning the sinners of the old World (amongst whom there were many Young men) that <HI>their Spirits,</HI> their Souls are <HI>in Prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 19. Miserable Souls! they have been in Prison now near upon Four Thousand Years: and Prisoners they must be another thousand years untill they shall be brought unto their Trial before all the World at the last day; and after that to a worse Prison, there to abide for ever and

ever. Before the dead body of a man or woman, that dieth in a state of sin is put into the Prison of the Grave, their Souls are in a worse Grave, in an Eternal Prison, in an everlasting Hell of Misery.</P>
<P N="2">2. Young men (as well as others) shall be brought into Judgment at the Great day. This is that which is cheefly intended in the Text before us. It is a truth which has been known and believed in all ages, that there will a day come, when He that made the World, will bring all the men that ever have been, are, or ever shall be, before His Tri|bunal. The <HI>Jews</HI> have a tradition amongst them, that this was the Controversy be|tween Cain and Abel: It is said <HI>that Can talked with Abel.</HI> Gen. 4. 8. The Scripture mentions not what the discourse was that passed between them, onely in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> there is an Extraordinary pause, intimating that they had more talk than is there ex|pressed. The <HI>Jews</HI> have it traditionally a|mongst them, that the thing which <HI>Cain</HI> said, was, that there is no other World but this, that there it no Immortal Soul, and that men shall not after this World is come to its end, be brought before God to Judg|ment, but that <HI>Abel</HI> contradicted him, say|ing, there is an Immortal Soul in every man, 
<PB N="33" REF="000728_0033_0FAA469C5D2AB0A8">
and there will be a great day of Judgment, when every man must give an account to God, of all that he ha's done in this life. Whether the Jews say true or no concerning such discourse between <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> the thing it self is most certainly true: A day of Judgment will come, and the beginning of it is now very near; not one man in all the World shall escape the Trial of that dread|full day. 2 Cor. 5. 10. <HI>We must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he ha's done whether it be good or bad.</HI> And in particular Young men who have walked in the ways of their own hearts, must hold up their guilty hands before the Barr of Di|vine Justice in that day. Rev. 20. 12. <HI>I saw the dead Small and Great stand before God, and the Dead were Judged according to their works&punc;</HI> So then the Small as well as the Great, Young ones as well as Elder ones, must stand before God, they must and shall appear before JE|SUS CHRIST the Son of God, who is God and not Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and be Judged either to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 words"> Everlasting death, according as their way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orkes shall in that day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 words"> And in the mean while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 words"> Young men who walk in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 words"> hearts arrest them

with sad Convictions at Times, that there is such a day approaching: When they have Committed a great Sin, suppose Uncleanness or Lying, or the like, Sins against the light of nature, there is that in their breasts which faith to each one of them, <HI>God will bring them into Judgment for that Sin.</HI> Where is there a Young man, that can say he never at all found it so?

To the Righteous it will be the most happy day that ever was, but unto them that have walked in the way of their hearts, and in the sight of their eyes, a bitter and a miserable day. A day of wrath: A day of Perdition. That it will be a sad day unto all (be they Young or Old) that shall be found in their sins and out of Christ, ap|pears from several things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that they have not improved their Talents committed unto them as they might and ought to have done. There is no man but some Talent or other is committed to him, which he ought to make a good use of.

He who is the Lord of us all, ha's given <HI>to Every man his Work,</HI> Mar. 13. 34. One man ha's this Work, and another man ha's that Work, in the doing of which he must im|prove his Talent. Young men are favoured with several peculiar Talents: Time is a precious Talent: Health, and Strength, and those Vigorous Affections which are com|monly in Young men, are great Talents which they must be accountable for. A day of Reckoning will come. It is said in the Parable concerning the Talents, <HI>After a Long Time the Lord of those Servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</HI> Math. 25. 19. It is now a long time since our Lord ascended into Hea|ven, but He will come quickly to Judge the Earth, and then will reckon with His Ser|vants: He will know of them how they have lived, and what they done in the World. A Servant that ha's been set to work, but spends his time in Idleness all the day, will have a miserable account to give unto his Master when night cometh. A Servant that ha's been trusted with Money or Goods to improve for his Masters use, if he shall Embezel or mispend them can expect no|thing but severity. Thus when God shall say to a Young man at the day of Judg|ment, I gave thee space to repent in, I suffered

What will thy Judgment! What thy Sentence be then? God in His Word ha's told all unprofitable Servants, what their Doom shall be. Math 25. 30. <HI>Cast ye the Un|profitable Servant into utter Darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</HI> Though a Young man, if he ha's been an unprofita|ble Servant, he must be cast into utter dark|ness, and the sad remembrance of lost op|portunities never to be recovered again will cause Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth.</P>
<P N="2">2. When God shall bring them into Judg|ment, all the Secret Sins of men will be re|vealed before the whole World.

Therefore the day of Judgment must needs be a day of horror and confusion to them. Where is there an ungodly Young man, but if all his secret sins (yea, the sins of his heart and all) should be revealed be|fore the World, he would be ready to say as <HI>Thamar</HI> when sollicited by a wicked Young man to commit folly with him, <HI>Whither shall I cause my shame to go,</HI> 2 Sam. 13. 13. The day of Judgment will be to them that dy in their sins a day of the greatest shame that ever was or that can be: then will God fulfill that threatning against sinners, Jer. 23. 40. <HI>I will bring an Everlasting reproach upon you, &amp; a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten.</HI> Now they seek to cover their sins by denials, fictions, and false-hoods, but it will be in vain for them to think to do so then. Witnesses to their conviction will appear against them in that day. The Judge Himself will be a witness 
<PB N="38" REF="000728_0038_0FAA469FAE3F5EE8">
against them: He will then say, My eyes saw what you did, and My ears heard every Word that was spoken by you. Jer. 29. 23. <HI>They have committed villany in Israel, they have com|mitted Adultery&mdash;even I know and am a wit|ness saith the Lord.</HI> And Angels will come in as witnesses against them. The devils who now Tempt them to do wickedly will then be their accusers: Yea, and holy An|gels whose eyes have been upon them, and whose Testimony will be received, shall be witnesses against them. And so will Con|science which is more than a thousand wit|nesses. For the remembrance of their sins remains in their Consciences for ever. Jer. 17. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>The sin of Judah is written with a pen of I|ron, and with the point of a Diamon:</HI> Where is it written? <HI>It is graven upon the Table of their heart.</HI> It ha's made such Impressions upon Conscience as cannot be gotten out. A sin which a Young man commits now, he will remember it after he is dead, and at the day of Judgment, and throughout the days of E|ternity. We see that men of an hundred years old will remember what they did four|score years ago more perfectly than what they did but four weeks since; a clear de|monstration that the Immortal Souls of men will never forget what was done by them

whilest in their bodys, though never so long ago since. Therefore in the Parable con|cerning the Rich man and Lazarus, it was said to him, <HI>Remember that in thy life time thou receivedst thy good things,</HI> Luk. 16. 25. Sinners in the World to come have a perfect remem|brance of all that they did whilest in this World: When therefore they shall be told of their secret sins, they will remember them all, and a dreadfull remembrance it will be.</P>
<P N="3">3. A sentence which will be exceeding terrible, and the execution thereof certain and unavoidable, will in the day of Judg|ment be pronounced on such as shall dy in their sins. They will then suffer a sentence of banishment, never to see the face of God any more, never to come within the Glorious Palace of the great King, which is a sad sen|tence indeed, Considering that in Gods fa|vour there is life, and His loving kindness is better than life it self. <HI>Wo unto them</HI> (saith God) <HI>when I depart from them,</HI> Hos. 9. 12. This wo will come upon every sinner at the day of Judgment. Sinners must then <HI>Go away</HI> from the Glorious and Gracious presence of God for ever: He will say to them <HI>depart.</HI> And the place which they shall be banished into will be the most dismal that can be i|magined: Into a place where they must ne|ver

see the light of the Sun; even into <HI>Out|er darkness,</HI> where there is nothing but a perpetual night. Psal. 49. 19. <HI>They shall never see light.</HI> And in that place they must dy. It was said unto <HI>Shebna,</HI> that with a mighty Captivity he should be carried into <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>there thou shalt dy,</HI> Isa. 22. 18. So at the day of Judgment, the Chaldeans of Hell will carry sinners with them into an Everlasting Captivity, and there they must dy. They shall then suffer not only a sentence of ba|nishment but of death too, and that the most dreadfull that can be thought of: They shall be sentenced to be burnt to death; to be cast into a Lake of fire and brimstone. The Scripture expresseth the Punishment of sin|ners in the World to come by such Metaphors because it will be more intolerable than those things really and literally done would be; as one in horror of Conscience looking on the fire, said, <HI>To burn in that fire is nothing to what I feel.</HI> And as certainly as the sentence shall be pronounced, execution will follow. For it is a Judgment never to be reversed, a sentence never to be repealed. In this life sinners may by Repentance towards God, and Faith in Jesus Christ obtain a Pardon, so as that the sentence of Condemnation which they are under shall not be executed upon

them, but at the day of Judgment it is other|wise: For the day of Grace is then at an end; there will not be one offer of Grace more then: Christ the Judge that now offers to obtain a Pardon from God His Father for those that will humble themselves and repent of their iniquity, will than be inexorable. No Cries, no Tears, no Prayers, no Entrea|ties will prevail with Him for mercy. Let sinners hear what He saith and tremble: for His words are these, <HI>Because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut my hand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man regarded, but ye have set at nought all my Counsil,</HI> and would none of my reproof, I will Laugh at your Calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a Whirel wind, when distress and anguish cometh upon you, <HI>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer, they shall then seek me early, but they shall not find me,</HI> for that they hated knowledge, and would not choose the fear of the Lord, they would none of my Counsil, they dispised all my reproof, there|fore they shall eat of the fruit of <HI>their own way,</HI> and be filled with their own devices <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. 24. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How should sinners escape in that day?

<P N="4">4. The misery of Sinners at the day of Judgment will be Eternal. It is called <HI>Eter|nal Judgment,</HI> Heb. 6. 2. because men are then adjudged to an eternal estate either of hap|piness or of misery. Whoever shall be found in their sins <HI>at that day</HI> must die not only by a Tormenting but an Everlasting Death. To be long in dying is a dismal thing. The pangs and Agonies of <HI>the Second Death</HI> will never be over. Rev. 14 11. <HI>The smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night.</HI> The pleasures of sin will then prove dear bought pleasures in|deed. It was a sad word which a man that had lived an ungodly life uttered on a death bed, <HI>I</HI> (said he) <HI>have enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a few years, and now I must be in tor|ment for it, more than a thousand Million of A|ges.</HI> Sin ha's a short pleasure attending it, but a long, an everlasting pain. It were well if Young men who walk in the wayes of 
<PB N="43" REF="000728_0043_0FAA46A6738A9868">
their own heart would think of this. A man that is in great pain and misery, suppose by some Tormenting disease, as by the Stone, Gout, Cancer or the like, is comforted with thinking this will not last alwayes; but when misery is endless as well as easeless, when there is Eternity added to extremity of do|lours, most wofull is the condition of such forlorn Creatures. Yet all this will Young men that continue to walk in the wayes of their own heart, bring themselves unto at the day of Judgment. Hell fire is a fire that never can be quenched: The breath of the Lord which is like a stream of Brim|stone kindleth that fire, and makes it to burn for ever.</P>

<P>INFOR. I. <HI>Hence we may assuredly Conclude that God will certainly Bless those Young men that do not walk in the way of their own hearts.</HI> Isaac said concerning his Son Jacob, <HI>I have Blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed.</HI> Thus may we say of Young men whose hearts are changed and mortified to sin, self, and

the World, <HI>God ha's Blessed them, yea, and they shall be Blessed.</HI> Indeed such a Young man is a rare sight. The Philosopher of old laid it down for a Maxim, that <HI>Wisdom was in|compatible to Youth,</HI> That a Young man could not be a Wise man, because Wisdom requires experience and experience requires time and age. This notwithstanding, the Grace of God may and it will make a Young man Wise. The Scripture speaks of <HI>a wise Child.</HI> Eccl. 4. 13. And of <HI>a Child that is an hundred years old,</HI> Isai. 65. 20. And of Young men that have the <HI>Spirit of God poured on them</HI> Joel 2. 28. The Young man that ha's saving Grace in his Soul will attend diligently to the Word of God; and whoever do's so will be blessed with that Wisdom, which will make him Eternally happy. <HI>David</HI> was a Young man when he wrote the 119 <HI>Psalm.</HI> But hear how he speaks in <HI>Verse 98, 99.

full of fruit they are pleased with it; so the Lord when He seeth Young Plants in His Church abounding in Works of Piety and Righteousness: When He beholds Young men a part, and Young Women a part Fast|ing and Praying, and mourning together be|cause of the sins of the Times and Places where they live; Oh how exceeding dear are such Young gracious Souls unto God and unto the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>JOHN</HI> was the Youngest of all the Apostles, scarce Twenty years old (as Ecclesiastical Writers report when he began his Publick Ministry, and he was the Disciple whom Jesus loved in a pe|culiar manner. They that honour God in their Youth, He is wont to honour them many times He maketh them blessed Instru|ments of much good in their Generations which is the greatest happiness that men on earth are capable of. How many instance are there in the Scripture concerning this that so Young men might be encouraged to seek and serve the Lord. <HI>Joseph</HI> a Godly Young man, and what a blessing vvas he no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> only to his Fathers Family, but to a who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> nation besides? <HI>Joshua</HI> vvas a pious Young man, and the Lord magnified him in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> sight of all Israel. <HI>Samuel, David, Solom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Obediah, Josiah, Timothy,</HI> were all of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

What a Crown of Glory shall such Young men receive at the day of Judgment? <HI>I write unto you Young men, because ye have overcome the Wicked one.</HI> 1 Joh. 2. 13. Ordinarily it is so, that Young men are singled out to be Souldiers: As for those Young men that have approved them|selves faithful Souldiers of Jesus Christ in fighting against, and <HI>Overcoming</HI> the flesh, the World, and the Devil, the Lord Jesus will reward them <HI>in that day.</HI> Christ will then say to them, I know all your Works, I know that when others did serve their lusts, and promote the Devils interest, you did serve God, and promote His Interest in the World.

<P>INFOR. II. <HI>Hence such Young men as conti|nue to walk in the wayes of their Heart, and in the sight of their Eyes, are very foolish Creatures.</HI> The Scripture calls them Fools, and there|fore they are so. Prov. 17. 21. <HI>He that begets a fool does it to his sorrow; and the father of fool ha's no joy.</HI> A profane Young man is that fool, whose father ha's sorrow and no

joy in him; one such son is enough to damp the joy which he may have in his other Children, who are not such Wicked Fools as that son is. Such <HI>Youngsters</HI> are <HI>Simple ones</HI> indeed. Hear what the Wisest of men faith Prov. 7. 7. <HI>I beheld amongst the simple ones, I discerned amongst the Youths, a Young man void of understanding.</HI> Consider a little if it be not so. Fools are easily deceived, and so are Young men that have not Grace in their hearts; sin deceiveth them; the Devil de|ceiveth them; vain Companions deceive them. They are easily drawn into the snares of Temptation: like silly birds they hasten to the snare not knowing that it is for their life. Persons are known to be ei|ther Wise or Foolish by the choice which they make. One that does preferr pebbles to Pearles, Trifles to the richest Treasure, is judged to be a fool. Thus it is vvith Young men that vvalk in the vvayes of their own heart, especially if they do so under the light of the Gospel, like fools as they are they re|fuse a good offer; with the Young man in the Gospel, they refuse the Treasures vvhich are in Heaven: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do they chuse instead thereof? but the Vanities of this present World, nay, sin vvhich is the vilest thing that can be chosen. They that ex|change 
<PB N="48" REF="000728_0048_0FAA46AA6756D4D0">
change things of the greatest valew, for those that are worth nothing are accounted fools. What folly was that of profane <HI>Esau</HI> to sell his birth right to gratify his carnal appetite. Thus do profane Young men do: They have Immortal Souls which are more worth than all the World, these do they exchange for sensual and brutish Lusts. To part with pleasures for-ever-more, to enjoy those that are but for a season, is infinite folly. He that runs into the fire is either a fool or a mad man: What Fools then are they, that will cast their own bodies and Souls into the fire that never shall be quenched? If it should be said unto a man, you shall enjoy all the pleasures which your heart can desire for a year together, on condition that after that you shall be in most inexpressible Tor|ment for an hundred years; no one but a Fool or a mad man would accept of the proposal. Are not they then, the greatest Fools who to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a few Years will go into everlasting punish|ment. I remember one of the Ancients speaks of a Chast Woman who being solli|cited by a profane vile Wretch to sin against God, desired him for her sake, to hold his hand in the fire but one quarter of an hour: That (said he) is an unreasonable desire, but 
<PB N="49" REF="000728_0049_0FAA46AADFF6C128">
ask any thing of me that is reasonable and He do it for your sake: To whom she re|plyed, <HI>Is it unreasonable for you to hold your finger in the fire one quarter of an hour for my sake, and do you think that it is reasonable for me for your sake to consent unto that, for which my Body and Soul must burn for ever in the fire that cannot be quenched.</HI> Therefore Young men that continue to walk in the ways of their own hearts, and so bring themselves to this at last, are Foolish Creatures.</P>

III. <HI>What a sad account will they have to give unto God at the day of Judgment, who have out lived their Youth, and yet shall dy in their Sins.</HI> If a Young man that ha's not lived Thirty years dying in his sins must be Eternally miserable, what must they be that have lived Forty, it may be Fifty years or more, and shall at last go out of the World in an Unconverted estate?

The Scripture speaks of those that are <HI>Old in Adulteries,</HI> Ezek. 23. 43. An old Wanton, an old Drunkard must needs fall under an heavy sentence in the day when God shall bring them into judgment. The 
<PB N="50" REF="000728_0050_0FAA46ACFB14CD38">
longer men continue in sin, the heavier will their Judgment be at last. There are moun|tains of Guilt on their sinfull Souls, and there|fore mountains of Wrath will break upon them in the great and terrible day of the Lord. What have such sinners been doing all their lives long? They have been trea|suring up Wrath against the day of Wrath; such a treasure as will never be spent through|out the days of Eternity. What an Infinite number of sins have they to answer for? And that not only as to Commissions of e|vil, but as to Omissions of duty?

I remember I knew a man that was Executed for an horrid Crime; and he did to me in private Con|fess his Guilt in other Capital offences which the World knew nothing of, acknowledging that God was righteous in bringing him to such a death; that poor Wretch when he

came to dy, declared unto all the Spectators that nothing troubled him so much, as that of his having disregarded the many Sermons which he heard Preached in the Name of the Lord: These were his sentiments when his Immortal Soul was going to appear be|fore God the Judge of all. So will it be with sinners at the last day. Suppose a man had heard but one Sermon in all his life in which he was called upon to repent and be|lieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, but shall neglect so great Salvation; this will make his account dreadfull <HI>in that day.</HI> But what then will become of those that have heard a thousand Sermons, and yet live and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their sins?

<HEAD>Some Considerations and Councils Let me set before you.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="consideration">
<P>Consider. I. <HI>The way which the generality of Young men walk in is a Wofull way.</HI> It will be found so at the Judgment day. It is the 
<PB N="52" REF="000728_0052_0FAA46AEB1E58B58">
way of their own heart which is the broad way that leadeth to destruction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> that it might not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 words"> of the Young men who have been born in <HI>New England.</HI> Many of them are profane Are there no profane Swearers to be found amongst Young men? It is a sad thing that there are any such. I knew the time when in <HI>New England</HI> Young men knew not what it is to Swear. A man might live Twenty years (some have done so, I my self did so when in my Youth) and never hear a pro|fane Oath in <HI>New-England.</HI> Is it so now? And are there not Young men who are lovers of Strong Drink? I wish I could say, that we had not <HI>Given the Nazarites wine to drink.</HI> Are there not Young men who are Sabbeth breakers, notwithstanding they have been put in mind of a Young man Ex|ecuted for Murder, who when dying Cryed out, Let Young men take Warning by me, <HI>and let them know that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> breaking will prove a dangerous and a costly sin unto them.</HI> Are there not Young men who are disobe|dient to their Parents, or to their Masters whom God has set over them, and that are like the Children of the Devil, given to Lying? Are there not Young men whose life is amongst the Unclean? Are there 
<PB N="53" REF="000728_0053_0FAA46AF6F479788">
not Young men that will Steal and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that will rob their Parents or Masters and say it is no Transgression. Nay, Young men born in <HI>New-England,</HI> that have turned bloody Pyrates, that to get Silver and Gold have embrewed their hands in blood. God will bring them into Judgment, and than they will wish that they had never been born, and most of all that they had never been born in <HI>New-England.</HI> There are others that are not profane, but like the Young man in the Gospel, they have Externally <HI>kept the Commandments in their Youth,</HI> who never|theless, are strangers unto Faith in Christ, and strangers to the new birth. Is it not so with the Youth throughout this Land generally? There are some and blessed be God that are so many Young men in <HI>New|England</HI> that the Grace of God is manifest in them. Nevertheless, do we not see that the Young Generation as to the greatest part of them, is a poor Unconverted, Perish|ing Generation? On that account it is not to be wondered at, that God from Heaven ha's Testifyed His displeasure against the present Generation. He ha's <HI>poured it out upon the Children abroad, and on the Assembly of Young men together.</HI> Jer 6. 11. It is a sad Word which is spoken in Isa. 9. 17. <HI>The Lord 
<PB N="54" REF="000728_0054_0FAA46B0540E0880">
shall have no joy in their Young men.</HI> And a|gain, Amos 4. 10. <HI>Your Young men have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the Sword.</HI> How many Young men in <HI>New-England</HI> have in these late years been numbred for the Sword? Many ha's a French Sword or an Indian Sword slain&punc; but more have been slain by the Sword of the Lord in respect of mortal diseases, which He ha's visited them with. We may say after the Prophet, <HI>Death is come up into our windows, to out of the Children from without, and the Young men from the Streets,</HI> Jer. 9. 21. And have not many Young Persons gone into Captivity. We may say with the La|menting Church, <HI>My Virgins and my Young men are gone into Captivity,</HI> Lam. 1. 18. Now then the Lord calls from Heaven unto Young ones that yet remain, saying, Oh! do not you continue to walk in the ways of your heart, left Captivity, left Death come upon you also: Do you think that the Young Persons whom God ha's thus dealt with, were greater sinners than any in <HI>New-Eng|land?</HI> I tell you nay, but repent left you like-wise Perish.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="consideration">
<P>Consider. II. <HI>There are some Young men who if they dy in their Sins, the day of Judg|ment will in a peculiar manner be a dreadfull day unto them.</HI> To instance, it will be so 
<PB N="55" REF="000728_0055_0FAA46B113882EE0">
unto such Young men as have been more wicked than ordinary; who have above others indulged themselves in walking after the lusts of their own hearts. It was said of Babylon, <HI>how much she ha's lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her.</HI> The more pleasure any have had in sin, the greater will their Torment be in the Judgment day. All ungodly ones will be punished in that day, but not all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The Lord ha's reserved the unjust unto the day of Judgment to be punished,<HI>but chiefly them</HI> that walk after the flesh in the lust of Uncleanness 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 10. A Young man that ha's committed but one act of Uncleanness, or that ha's been Drunk but one time in all his life, must perish for ever without Repentance, much more one that ha's been so an hundred times over. Again, they that have been favoured with means of Grace above others, and yet shall neglect the great Salvation, will have the sadder account to give unto God at the day of Judgment. The Son of God ha's declar|ed it, Math. 11. 23, 24. <HI>Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which art Exalted unto Heaven; shall be brought down to Hell, it shall be more tolerable for the Land of Sodom in the day of Judgment than for thee.</HI> There are some Young men who as they have singular advantages to gain knowledge, 
<PB N="56" REF="000728_0056_0FAA46B1B76EA898">
so they do know more than others: Now if such miss of Heaven, their knowledge will be as an aggravation of their sin, so of their punishment at the last day. He that know|eth his Lords will, but doth it not shall be beaten with many Stripes; unto whom much is given, of him shall be much required. <HI>Luk 12. 48.</HI> Again, a Young man that ha's had Godly Relations, and yet shall continue in his sins, will on that account come under the sadder Condemnation when God shall bring him into Judgment. When those of the same Family with him have set before him good Examples: It may be he ha's seen his own Brother or Sister turning from sin unto God; and yet continues to walk in the way of his heart and the sight of his eyes: This will render him inexcusable in the day of Judgment. <HI>Esau</HI> will be Damned the deep|er in Hell because he had such a Brother as <HI>Jacob;</HI> whose Piety he saw but did not imi|tate. But especially such as have been born of Godly Parents, if they continue to walk in the way of their own hearts, will have a sad account to give at the day of Judgment. Inasmuch as they have broken the everlasting Covenant, the Waters of Baptism will be turned into fire at that day: The Tears and Prayers of their pious Parents will be as oyl 
<PB N="57" REF="000728_0057_0FAA46B2932E9D30">
to the flames of Hell. There Examples and all their Instructions and Admonitions will rise up in Judgment against the Children of their own bowels. How dreadfull will it be when a Godly Father and Mother shall joyn with the Lord Jesus Christ in passing a Sentence of Death on the Children whom themselves have begotten. As his said Zach. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 3. <HI>His father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, thou shalt not live.</HI> So will they say, when they hear the Son of God saying it before them. It is reported of the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI> that when he saw his Children slain before his eyes, he used that Expression, <HI>Thou art Righteous O Lord because thou hast Judged thus.</HI> So will it be at the day of Judgment. As the Elders said when the great Whore was Judged, <HI>Amen; Halle|lujah,</HI> Rev. 19. 4. So when a Godly Father shall hear the Son of God pass the Sentence of Eternal Condemnation on the Child which was exceeding dear to him, he will say, Amen! Amen! Thou Righteous Judge; I Praise thy Glorious Justice: I have nothing to say, why this Child of mind should not be sent into Everlasting burnings. Thou knowest that I Prayed for him; Thou knowest I Instructed him; Thou knowest I Endeavoured to set an holy Example before 
<PB N="58" REF="000728_0058_0FAA46B37144A3F0">
him, but he would go on in the way of his heart and in the sight of his eyes: Therefore do I Justify and Joyn with Thee in the Righteous Sentence which is passed upon him. You that are the Children of Godly Praying Parents, think sadly of this.</P>

<P><HI>Consider.</HI> III. <HI>They that turn from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ayes of their own heart unto God in Christ, shall not come into a Judgment of Condemnation.</HI> Indeed, all must be brought into Judgment, but as for them that repent and believe it will be a Judgment of Absolution, and not of Condemnation. He that believes ha's Everlasting life, and <HI>shall not come into Con|demnation,</HI> but is passed from Death unto Life. Joh. 5. 24. If Young men repent and turn from all their transgressions, and betake them|selves unto Jesus Christ for Salvation, all their sins will be pardoned. <HI>I write unto you little Children, because your sins are forgiven you for his Names sake.</HI> 1 Joh 2. 12. The sins of Child-hood and Youth are many, and some|times very great. How many Wicked Words have they spoken? What Sabbath breaking? What disobedience to Parents have Children and Young men been guilty of? How ma|ny Lyes have they told, for which they must be Damned in Hell fire without Re|pentance. 
<PB N="59" REF="000728_0059_0FAA46B3E2823698">

<HEAD>Some Counsils let me leave with you.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Do nothing which you are unwilling that ever the World should know that you have done that thing.</HI> For it is certain that at the day of Judgment all will be known: Even <HI>Every Work whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</HI> All the passages of your lives where|ver you have been, will be called over. They are all Written down in a Book. <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12. The <HI>Jews</HI> have an apprehension that the An|gels write down all the Works of men, and will produce them at the day of Judgment&punc; To be sure, God Writes them down, and Conscience will remember them, and the World will hear of them. This is a Good Rule for every man to remember; It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would not have it known that such a thing ha's been done by me, then never let me do it If Young men would remember this, it would keep them from commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ting many a sin. Remember therefore the Words of the Lord Jesus Christ, who ha's said. 
<PB N="60" REF="000728_0060_0FAA46B4F4AA2D80">
<HI>There is nothing Covered that shall not be Re|vealed, neither hid that shall not be known</HI> Luk. 12. 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Beware of those sins in a special manner which do often times prove the Ruin of Young Men.</HI> To Instance, Breaches of the Seventh Commandment are evils which Young men are often found guilty of, and by indulging themselves therein they provoke God in a way of Judicial dispensation to give them up unto that and unto other lusts of their own heart also. The Lord in his forest Wrath saith, <HI>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</HI> Again, those sins of Drinking and Company keeping prove fatal to the Souls of many Young Persons. A Father once hearing that a Son of his was become a Drunkard, gave him up for lost and gone. I shall never forget with what anguish a Young man that dyed in this place above Twenty years ago, on his dead bed laid the ruin of his Soul to his vain drinking Companions. Beware of that sin of Idleness, or mispence of precious Time: there are many Young men who have much to answer for in this respect. They have not been deligent in their Call|ings. They have enticed one another to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Ale-house, or to the Coffee-house or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Tavern; when they have no call to 
<PB N="61" REF="000728_0061_0FAA46B789AAD698">
be there; and there do they spend a World of precious time in Drinking, or in unprofi|table Discourse, or it may be in Gaming; for which they will have a fearfull account to give to God at the hour of Death, and at the Judgment to come.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Title</HI> of the Psalm sheweth that it was Written by <HI>David the Servant of the Lord.</HI> There are but two Psalmes in which he is so Stiled, and both of them were Written after his being Anointed King. 
<PB N="66" REF="000728_0065_0FAA46BAAB8ACA20">

<P>As for the Time when this portion of Scripture was Penned, that is not particu|larly expressed. A Judicious Expositor ha's Conjectured that David wrote it when <HI>Abi|ather</HI> came to him, and acquainted him with what <HI>Saul</HI> had done in Murdering <HI>A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">imeleck,</HI> and all the Priests at <HI>Nob.</HI> Hence a wicked man is described and charecteris|ed from the Example of <HI>Saul,</HI> in the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of this Psalm: <HI>The Transgression of the Wicked saith within my heart, there is no fear of God before his Eyes:</HI> He seems to intimate that once he had too great a Charity for <HI>Saul,</HI> supposing that he might sin out of In|firmity, Melancholy, or Passion, rather than out of Malice; but now he was convinced in his Heart and Conscience, that <HI>Saul</HI> was a very wicked man: That he was wholly destitute of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fear of God; his Mur|dering the Priests of the Lord was an evi|dence of it. Such actions were done by 
<PB N="67" REF="000728_0066_0FAA46BB83A09AA8">
him as were inconsistent with the fear of God.</P>
<P>As for the Words at present to be insist|ed on, there have been various Translations, and so various Interpretations of them, which (as not being much to Edification) I shall not trouble you with. But as they are before us, two things are affirmed con|cerning the Wicked man. (1.) That <HI>he Flattereth himself in his iniquity:</HI> He is secure notwithstanding the sin he has been guilty of: He pleaseth himself with vain Imagi|nations concerning his present and future happiness. (2.) The Psalmist affirms that sin will at last appear in other colours before the wicked man than at present it does. <HI>It will be found to be hatefull.</HI> Now iniquity is sweet, but the time shall come when it will be bitter: Though at present it appears in false colours, as if sin were a desirable thing, it will in the end of all ap|pear to be a most detestable thing. The <HI>DOCTRINE</HI> therefore from the words, is, 
<Q><HI>That although Sinners may Flatter and please themselves with vain Imaginations to the Contrary, it is certain that Sin will at last appear to be a most Odious thing.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="000728_0067_0FAA46BC20F82F80">
The particulars contained in this Doctrine may be expressed in three <HI>PROPOSITIONS,</HI> all which are implyed in it.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition. I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Persons who indulge themselves in sin, are not apprehensive of the Evil and Danger which is therein.</HI> They flatter themselves. They please themselves with vain Imaginations. Otherwise they would be afraid to sin, and much more to go on in their trespasses. There are several vain Imaginations which sinners flatter themselves with.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They please themselves with thinking that sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no sin.</HI> That when they sin fear|fully they have not sinned at all. How com|mon is it for men, if they intend well in what they do, to think all is well. Like <HI>Saul</HI> who excused his transgressing a positive Com|mand of God, with saying, he did it for Sacrifice. Sin and Satan do wonderfully blind the eyes of sinners. Hence they sometimes take damning Errors to be rare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as the deluded Christians in <HI>Thyati|ra</HI> did, Rev. 2. 24. <HI>The depths of Satan as they Speak.</HI> They said that the things which they did believe were <HI>deep</HI> rare Mysteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> so did <HI>they speak</HI> concerning those Errors which at last they found to be no better than Satanical delusions. When men have

shut their eyes against the clear light, their light does become darkness, and how great is that darkness? A spirit of strong de|lusion is sent upon them, so that <HI>they believe a Ly.</HI> 2. Thes. 2. 11. And because men err in their Judgments, they are guilty of such practices as will prove the ruin of their Souls, and yet flatter themselves that their is no sin nor evil in what they do. Idolatry is a Soul-ruining iniquity, yet the <HI>Jews</HI> of old who lived in that sin, would not believe they were guilty of any such crime. The Prophets by all their Sermons could not convince them of it. Jer. 2. 35. <HI>Thou sayest, because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me, behold, I will plead with thee because thou sayest I have not sinned.</HI> Men may be under the power of Sin and Satan so far as not only to believe that a damning sin is no sin at all, but that it is a duty. To per|secute the faithfull Ambassadors of Christ to death is a crime of an high nature: Yet did the Lord say to his Apostles, <HI>The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think he does God Good Service.</HI> Joh. 16. 2. Thus it was with <HI>Paul</HI> before his Convertion. <HI>He verily thought with himself that he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Na|zareth,</HI> Acts 28. 9. This indeed was not <HI>Sauls</HI> 
<PB N="70" REF="000728_0069_0FAA46BDDA6A1D90">
case when he killed the Priest at <HI>Nob.</HI> He sinned Maliciously against his Conscience, at the very time when he commanded bloody <HI>Doeg</HI> to Murder them; he called them <HI>the Priests of the Lord:</HI> Some have there|fore thought that he did at that time Com|mit the sin against the Holy Ghost, because his knowledge and his malice was very great. But many of those that kill and burn them whom they call Hereticks, do it more out of Ignorance than Malice, thinking they do well in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Imagination which sinners please themselves with, is, <HI>That is what they do is a sin, yet that it is no great or dangerous sin.</HI> They say of the iniquity which they indulge themselves in, as <HI>Lot</HI> said of <HI>Zoar, Is it not a little one.</HI> Gen. 19. 20. Thus <HI>Ephraim Loved to oppress,</HI> and yet he said, <HI>they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin,</HI> Hos. 12. 7, 8. The Hebrew word there translated Sin, is ma|ny times used to denote a great Sin: <HI>Epha|rim</HI> pleased himself that they should find in him no iniquity that was of an hanious or criminal nature, notwithstanding his being guilty of great oppression, he esteemed that to be no sin, that is to say <HI>no great sin.</HI> There are great Oppressiors in the World, who justify themselves in their Oppression They 
<PB N="71" REF="000728_0070_0FAA46BE67EFD8B0">
that are guilty of biting and oppressing usury commonly do so. Sinners remem|ber not what Christ has said, Math. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 19. <HI>Whosoever shall break one of these least Com|mandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;</HI> he shall be of no account there, he shall never come there, if he do's allow himself in the willfull breach of the least Command|ment. Men are apt to please themselves that none on the earth are without sin; the best have their failings: and that their iniquities are only sins of Infirmity, such as Gods Children whilest in the World are Subject unto; and that therefore they shall have a pardon in course for them: they cannot think that the merciful God will be so severe as to punish them Eter|nally for such small matters; not believ|ing that the least sin is in its own nature deadly and damning. And it is possible for men to be so blinded as to think that great sins are little ones. The Gentiles thought that Fornication and Drunkenness were no great sins: and therefore they had no Laws to punish such iniquities But the Lord in his Word declares that they which do such things shall not Inherit the Kingdom of God, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 21.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="000728_0071_0FAA46BF391E19D0">
Hence 3. Sinners are apt to flatter them|selves, <HI>That though they do iniquity they shall escape Punishment.</HI> Notwithstanding the awfull threatnings of God in His word, the Sinner thinks he shall do as well as others. When he heareth the words of the Curse, <HI>He blesseth himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace though I walk in the Imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.</HI> Deut. 29. 20. There are many such sinners, who after they have made themselves a thirst with strong drink, will make them|selves drunk again, and yet say they shall have Peace. They promise themselves Impunity in sinning against the Holy God. Hence the Psalmist speaketh, as in Psal. 10. 13. <HI>Wherefore doth the wicked Contemn God? he hath said in his heart thou shalt not require it.</HI> Every <HI>Sinner</HI> so far forth as he is a sin|ner, is an <HI>Atheist:</HI> he faith in his heart that there is no such God as the Lord is. Either he is such an Athest as to Imagine that God does not take notice of the sins of men, Psal. 94. 7. <HI>They say the Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</HI> A vile wretch when he is about to commit a sin, suppose The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t or Uncleanness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the like odious wickedness, if he believed that any man, nay, that a Child of Seven years

No, he is an <HI>Athei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> Or, he sayeth in his heart, that the Lord is not so Holy a God as his Word declare, Him to be. That He is not so much offended with sin as His Ministers say He is. They imagine a God made up all of mercy, with|out any justice or Holiness. They Judge of God by themselves; because they do not hate sin, they think the Lord hates it not. They flatter themselves that because God bears with them for a time, that He will never call them to an account, Psal. 50. 21.<HI> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughest that I was altogether such an one as thy self; but I will reprove thee, and set them in Order before thee.</HI> Or, they flat|ter themselves that because of some exter|nal show of Religion, or some good works done by them, all their sins will be for|given. They vainly suppose that by some Righteousness of their own they shall make amends for all their transgressions. They think the Lord will be pacified with Rivers of oyl, and that the fruit of their bodies will Compensate for the sin of their Souls. The Jews would <HI>Steal, Commit Adultery, and Swear falsly,</HI> and yet trust in Lying 
<PB N="74" REF="000728_0073_0FAA46C2345260F0">
words, saying, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</HI> Jer. 74. They would go to the Temple and there offer Sacrifice and then say, <HI>we are delivered;</HI> we are purged from our past transgressions; and now having cleared the old Score, we may safely venture to sin again, and by going to the Temple we shall be delivered, and never punished for these abominations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not men in these days <HI>Flatter themselves, af|ter</HI> the like manner? If they go to the Temple, if they go to Church, if they offer Sacrifice, if they say their Prayers there, they promise themselves impunity though they live in sin. Thus are they who in|dulge themselves in the wayes of sin secure and not aware of the Infinite danger their Souls are in.</P>

Thought but the Divine Law Condemns it. A sinner and a transgressor of the Law are the same. A sinner does practically declare that the Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f God is no good Law: He trampleth it under foot, he casts it behind his back. Sin is therefore an hate|full and a horrible thing. Jer. 5. 30. <HI>An hor|rible thing ha's been Committed in the land</HI> Did men know what an evil sin is, the thoughts of it, would strike them with horror and dread.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sin makes those that love and live in it to become Odious.</HI> Therefore it must needs be the hatefullest evil that can be thought of. It ha's caused some of the most Ex|cellent Creatures that ever were made, to become hatefull and abhorred. This is true concerning the Angels that sinned: They were once among <HI>the Sons of God, the morning Stars shouting for joy.</HI> Job 38. 7. The morning Star is a lovely Creature Sin ha's turned Angels of light into Devils of darkness; morning Stars into the Darkness of Hell.

<PB N="77" REF="000728_0076_0FAA46C46BB116D0">
sin ha's made them to be the most hate|full Creatures in the World; and next un|to sin we ought to hate the Devil, and to have no communion with him. But how Odious an evil is sin then! It makes men also to become the objects of hatred, Tit. 3. 3. <HI>We were sometimes hatefull,</HI> that is wor|thy to be hated of God and man.

Ungodly wretches out of whose mouths proceed corrupt Commu|nications, that delight in filthy obscene dis|course, that will revile the Saints of God, Scoff at Religion, Curse and Swear, and Profane the blessed Name of God, a good man hates to be in their Company.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Sin makes men Miserable.</HI> And it is therefore an hatefull thing. Men hate to be miserable, but then let them hate sin the procuring cause of all their Miseries.

throughout a wholeLand which suffers under the weight of them; such as Wars, Famines, Pestilential and wasting diseases which leave great desolations behind them. These are procured by sin, Mic. 1. 8. <HI>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.</HI> There are Judgments which fall upon particular Fa|milies; sometimes a great Family is brought to ruin: Thus it was with the house of <HI>Jeroboam, Ahab</HI> and others whom we read of in Scripture; and it was sin that pro|voked the Lord to destroy them all. As for the man that shall do very wickedly, the Lord saith, <HI>I will set my face against that man, and against his Family and will cut him off,</HI> Lev. 20. 5. Nay, which is awfull to con|sider, if a Godly man shall through the power of Temptation become guilty of a Scandalous sin, it may be God to testify his holy displeasure at the sin of that good man will destroy all his Family: What came on <HI>Gideons</HI> numerous Family after he was dead and his Soul in Heaven? because of their Fathers sin, threescore and ten per|sons of them were Murthered in one day. <HI>Gideon</HI> made an Ephod, and that became a ruining snare to his house.

This was fullfilled in the days of <HI>Saul,</HI> unto whose bloody Malice <HI>David</HI> (as I told you but now) seems to allude in the Text and Context before us. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> being Commissioned by <HI>Saul, Fell upon the Priests, and slew in that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen Ephod: And Nob the City of the Priests smote he with the Edge of the Sword, both men and women, chil|dren and suckling,</HI> 1 Sam. 22. 18, 19. Thus did God perform against <HI>Eli</HI> the thing which He had spoken concerning his Fa|mily: And doubtless when this was first done, it made the Ears of them that heard of it to tingle. Again, there are personal Judgments, which sin is wont to bring with it. Men are exposed unto sufferings in Bodies, Names, Estates, none of which would ever have been, if they had not sin|ned. Isa 42. 24. <HI>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers, did not the Lord, He against whom we have sinned.</HI> Though Afflictions are sent for other causes, and

not for sin only, as we see in that instance of the man that was born blind, <HI>Job.</HI> 9 3. Nevertheless, it is certain, that Sin is the Parent of all Sorrow: If men had never sinned, they would never have known Sor|row: Nor did ever any man in the World suffer any thing, but either his own on o|ther mens sins were the procuring cause of it. Temporal death is also the bitter fruit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> sin.

Joh. 9. 39. <HI>Jesus said, for Judgment am I come into this world, that they which see might be made blind.</HI> Natural blindness is a sore Calamity, but Spiritual blindness is incomparably a greater evil.

Therefore it is that <HI>The Man Christ Jesus,</HI> ha's more of God in Him than any Man or Creature, because He is fuller of Grace then can be said of any other man or Angel. It pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell in him: Of his full|ness we all receive, and grace for grace. God giveth not the Spirit of Holiness by measure unto him, as He does to all others. More of Gods Glory is to be seen shining in that Man, then in all the World besides. He is <HI>the Image of the Invisible God,</HI> Col. 1. 19. In respect of His Eternal Person, He is the Essential Image of God, the bright|ness of the Fathers Glory, and the express Image of His Person. And as Man He is the <HI>Manifestative</HI> Image of God; there is more of God to be seen in <HI>That Holy Thing,</HI> the Humane Nature of Jesus Christ the Son of God, than in all Angels and men. It is said of God that He is <HI>Glorious in Ho|liness.</HI> Exod. 15. 11. His Holiness is His chief Glory. Yea, it is His Life. The Apostle saith of the ungodly Gentiles, that they were <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the life of God,</HI> Eph. 4. 18. because they were Strangers and Ene|mies to Holiness.

If thou art one that shall be saved, every one of thy sins ha's had a stab at Christ: not one of thy sins but the Soul of the Son of God ha's had a stab for it. He felt that for thy sins which made Him to swear Blood. If you should see the knife that had Murdered your dearest friend, would you not be filled with indignation at the sight of it? Sin is the Sword that ha's Pierced the heart of the best friend that ever thou hadst in the World. <HI>He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities,</HI> Isa. 53. 5.
