<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<PB REF="018996_0003_0FA9156101350948">
<P>AS this poem is the first of the kind, which has been published in this country, the writer begs leave to introduce it with several observations, which that circum|stance alone may perhaps render necessary.</P>
<P>He has taken to himself the liberty of altering the real order of the two last battles, because he imagined the illus|trious events, which attended the battle of Gibeon, would make it appear to be the catastrophe of the poem, where|ever inserted.</P>
<P>He has varied the story of the embassy from Gibeon, for reasons, which he thinks will be obvious to every read|er, and which he hopes will be esteemed his sufficient justification.</P>
<P>To give entire Unity to the Action, he has made Jabin the Can&auml;anitish hero through the whole poem; and has transferred the scene of the battle, between Hazor and Israel, from the shores of the lake Merom to the neigh|bourhood of Ai.</P>
<P>In the Manners, he has studied a medium between ab|solute barbarism and modern refinement. In the best cha|racters, he has endeavoured to represent such manners, as are removed from the peculiarities of any age, or country, and might belong to the amiable and virtuous, of every age: such as are elevated without design, refined with|out ceremony, elegant without fashion, and agreeable, be|cause they are ornamented with sincerity, dignity, and religion, not because they are polished by art and edu|cation. Of such manners, he hopes he may observe, without impropriety, that they possess the highest advan|tages for universal application.</P>
<P>He has made use of Rhyme, because he believed it would be more generally relished than blank verse, even amongst those who are esteemed persons of tas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be thought the result of inattention or ignorance, that he chose a subject, in which his coun|trymen had no national interest. But he remarked that the Iliad and Eneid were as agreeable to modern nations, as to the Greeks and Romans. The reason he suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to be obvious&mdash;the subjects of those poem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> furnish the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> opportunities of exhibiting the agreeable&punc; the novel&punc; the moral, the pathetic, and the sublime. If he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not deceiv|ed,
<PB REF="018996_0004_0FA91561CBC79448">
the subject he has chosen possesses, in a degree, the same advantages.</P>
<P>It will be observed that he has introduced some new words, and annexed to some old ones, a new signification. This liberty, allowed to others, he hopes will not be refused to him: especially as from this source the copi|ousness and refinement of language have been principal|ly derived.</P>
<P>That he wishes to please he frankly confesses. If he fails in the design, it will be a satisfaction that he shall have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">jured no person but himself. As the poem is uniform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y friendly to delicacy, and virtue, he hopes his countrymen will so far regard him with candour, as not to impute it to him as a fault, that he has endea|voured to please them, and has thrown in his mite, for the advancement of the refined arts, on this side of the Atlantic.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Subject proposed. Invocation. After the battle, mentioned in the beginning of the seventh chapter of Joshua, the Israelites, in correspondence with the sacred history&punc; are represented in circumstances of extreme distress. With this event the poem opens, in the evening. Morning. Scene of war. Story of Zimri, and Aram. Zimri returns to the assembly of Israel, and brings an account of the death of Aram, and of an army, sent by Jabin, king of Hazor, to assist Ai. Distress of the Israelites. Char|acter and oration of Hanniel. After a pathetic address, and rehearsal of their miseries, he attempts to prove the impossibility of succeeding in their present design, because of the strength, skill, and numerous allies of their enemies; foretels their approaching ruin, asserts that <HI>GOD</HI> is op|posed to them, that they were led out of Egypt to silence their murmurs, and, the end being accomplished, ought to re|turn. Panegyric on that country; obviates objections to a return, and informs them that, if they should conquer Can&auml;an, they will be ruined, during the war, by the necessary neglect of arts and agriculture, difficulty of di|viding the land, of settling a form of government, and of avoiding tyranny; and concludes with a new exhortation to return to Egypt. Applause. Joshua replies, and be|ginning to explain the dispensations of Providence, is interrupted by Hanniel, who first obliquely, and then open|ly accuses him of aiming at the usurpation of kingly autho|rity; and asserts the return to be easy. Joshua vindicates his innocence with severity upon Hanniel; and allowing they can return, paints to them the miseri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, they will ex|perience from the Egyptian king, lords, people, and man|ners, and from providential dispensations terminating in their ruin. He appeals to them to judge of the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ehood of Hanniel's ideas of the purposes of Heaven, in leading them out of Egypt; and declares the certainty of their success from their union, with a few exceptions, their previous prosperity, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour and revealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esigns of Heaven, and exalts in their future glory.

<P>Characters of Hezron, Irad, and Selima. Morning. Irad and Selima walk out on the plain, northward of the camp, and hold a conversation on the justice of the War. As they are returning to the camp, they overhear two Israel|ites conversing on a design of returning into Egypt. Irad communicates the discovery to Joshua. The alarm is gi|ven, and an army percieved, coming from Ai to attack the camp. Joshua goes out to the place of rendezvous, marshals a body of troops, and sends them, under the com|mand of Zimri, to meet the army of Ai. In the mean time the camp is in a general uproar, and a large body of the Israelites assembled, westward of the camp, for the purpose of returning into Egypt&punc; After the confusion is in a degree allayed, Tadmor harangues the insurgents, with a list of grievances, and stimulates them to perseverance. Caleb who, with Hezron, had been sent by Joshua, upon Irad's information, to watch the motions of the camp, re|plies to him. Ardan answers him, with impudence, and Hezron him, with severity. Insurgents march. As they are quitting the plain, Joshua comes out, with a body of troops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attack them. The chieftains set thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forces in array. Joshua orders them to disperse. Ardan affronts him, and is killed. The insurgents disperse, and the chiefs return to the camp. Irad goes out to view the battle. Armies engage with violence, and equal success; until the chiefs of Ai, influenced by superstitious fears, excited by the ap|pearance of a thunder storm, order a retreat. Zimri also retires.

<L>OF Judah's thousands Hezron held the sway;</L>
<L>And love, and reverence, bade them all obey.</L>
<L>The chief, of simple manners, knew no art;</L>
<L>Truth was his language; honesty his heart:</L>
<L>To bless mankind his life's unvaried end; <MILESTONE N="5"></L>
<L>His guest the stranger, and the poor his friend.</L>
<L>So fair his strong, and stubborn virtue shone,</L>
<L>Heaven crown'd his wishes with a lovely son.</L>
<L>To mould young Irad was his darling care;</L>
<L>To form for peace, to animate for war; <MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>His limbs t' innerve; his vices to controul,</L>
<L>And lead to wisdom's fount his thirsty soul.</L>
<L>In earliest years, the favourite Youth began</L>
<L>To shew those charms, which rarely grace the man.</L>
<L>To rashness brave, his bosom burn'd for fame; <MILESTONE N="15"></L>
<L>Yet knew a milder, and a nobler flame:</L>
<L>Love's gentle fire his passions could controul,</L>
<L>And pure Religion warm'd his manly soul.</L>
<L>Not that, which broods upon the surly brow.</L>
<L>Or walks on frozen joints, demure, and slow; <MILESTONE N="20"></L>
<L>At truth, and virtue, points the fatal wound,</L>

<L>O'ER the wide world immeasurably spread,</L>
<L>Night, still and gloomy, cast a solemn shade.</L>
<L>In heavens half-clouded stars unfrequent hung;</L>
<L>Scarce heard, the blast with mournful murmurs rung;</L>
<L>Above tall, eastern hills, the moon's pale eye <MILESTONE N="5"></L>
<L>Look'd sad, and dreadful, from the cheerless sky:</L>

<L>And edg'd her vapoury robes with dismal stains.<MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>All, but the savage race, to sleep retir'd,</L>
<L>And the last gleams of western skies expir'd.</L>
<L>Stretch'd in his tent, unhappy Irad lay,</L>
<L>And sad oblivion bore his toils away.</L>
<L>In that still hour, when rapt on eagle-wings,<MILESTONE N="15"></L>

<HEAD>THE CONQUEST OF CAN&Auml;AN. BOOK IX.</HEAD>
<L>NOW sober evening hung her curtains round,</L>
<L>And gloomy sadness brooded o'er the ground.</L>
<L>All pale, and solemn, rose the languid moon,</L>
<L>And shed a feeble twilight from her throne.</L>
<L>Sad in her tent, the feeling maiden sate,<MILESTONE N="5"></L>
<L>Fed on her woes, and sigh'd her hapless fate.</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in tears, her render parents came,</L>
<L>To share her grief, and stay life's parting flame.</L>
<L>Like dull, cold lights, that hover o'er the tomb,</L>
<L>A lone lamp languish'd round the silent room:<MILESTONE N="10"></L>
<L>Beside her couch, two lorn attendants stay'd,</L>
<L>And drooping, lingering, eyed th' unconscious maid.</L>
<L>O'er the sad scene the pair attentive hung;</L>
<L>Then round the favourite form all-anxious clung:</L>
<L>Her tearless eye-balls scarce the virgin turn'd,<MILESTONE N="15"></L>
<L>But, fix'd in blank despair, her slumbering Irad mourn'd.</L>
<L>Awake! oh wake! the tender mother cry'd&mdash;</L>
<L>My child! my darling! nature's loveliest pride!</L>
<L>Awake, and hear! oh hear thy mother's call!</L>
<L>Behold these tears for thee in anguish fall!<MILESTONE N="20"></L>
<L>Ah see thy sire, with mighty woes oppress'd!</L>
<L>His sighs hard-bursting from his heaving breast!</L>
<L><PB N="214" REF="018996_0215_0FA913E689511DD8">Turn, turn thine eye! thy hapless parents save!</L>
<L>Nor speed our footsteps to the dreary grave!</L>
<L>She spoke. O'erwhelm'd in bitterness of fate,<MILESTONE N="25"></L>
<L>Still the sweet maiden unregardful sate:</L>
<L>Fix'd on the parent, droop'd her failing eyes&punc;</L>
<L>And deep, and heavy, heav'd her long-drawn sighs.</L>
<L>Again the mother, lost in sad amaze,</L>

<L>Thus spoke the parent. Struggling rose the fair,</L>
<L>And look'd unmeasur'd woe, and blank despair:</L>
<L>Again she languish'd; to the couch she fell,</L>
<L>And life sad-lingering seem'd to bid farewell.</L>
<L>Pierc'd to the soul, the tender father stood,<MILESTONE N="45"></L>
<L>And, lost in woes like her's, the darling view'd,</L>
<L>He saw the mild reproof her sense recall,</L>
<L>Her strength reviv'd her tears in silence fall;</L>
<L>A beam of glimmering hope his grief allay'd,</L>
<L>And thus, with grave, but gentle voice, he said&mdash; <MILESTONE N="50"></L>

<L>Let not that death-like gaze our souls affright.</L>
<L>Arise to thought I to sense, and reason, rise!</L>
