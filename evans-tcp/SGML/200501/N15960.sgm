<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Map, which the following sheets are intended to explain, comprehends almost the whole of the country, lying between the 34th and 44th degrees of lati|tude, and the 79th and 93d degrees of longitude, and de|scribes an extent of territory, of about 850 miles in length, and 700 miles in breadth; and one, which, for health|fulness, fertility of soil, and variety of productions, is not, prehaps, surpassed by any on the habitable globe.</P>
<P>Those parts of the country lying <HI>westward</HI> of the Al|legheny mountain, and upon the rivers <HI>Ohio</HI> and <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and upon most of the other rivers; and the lakes (laid down in my Map) were done from my own surveys, and corrected by my own Observations of latitudes, made at different periods preceding, and during all the campaigns of the <HI>last</HI> war (in several of which I acted as an Engineer) and <HI>since</HI> in many reconnoitring tours. which I made through various parts of the country, between the years 1764 and 1775.</P>
<P>I have compared my own Observations, and Surveys, respecting the lakes, with those made by Captain Brehm, of the 60th Regiment of Foot (who was for many years employed as an Engineer in North America) and I find, that they correspond with more exactness than Surveys usually do, which are made by different persons, at dif|ferent times;&mdash;and I am happy in this opportunity, of expressing my obligations to this Gentleman, for the cheerfulness with which he furnished me with his Surveys and Remarks.</P>
<P>It is fit also, that I should take notice, that in the ac|count which I have given of several of the <HI>branches</HI> of the Ohio, and Alleghany rivers, I have adopted the words of the late ingenious Mr. Lewis Evans, as I found he had properly described them in the Analysis to his Map of the Middle Colonies.&mdash;And as to that portion of my Map, which represents the country lying on the <HI>eastern</HI> side of the Alleghony mountain,&mdash;I take the liberty of informing my

<HEAD>A TOPOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE lands lying on the westerdly line, between the <HI>Laurel</HI> Mountain and the <HI>Allegheny</HI> River, and thence northerly up that River for 150 miles, on both sides of the same, tho' not much broken with high mountains, are not of the same excellent quality with the lands to the southward of Fort Pitt. They consist chiefly of <HI>White Oak,</HI> and <HI>Chesnut</HI> ridges; and in many places of poor <HI>Pitch Pines,</HI> inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">persed with tracts of good land; and low mea|dow grounds.</P>
<P>The lands comprehended between the River <HI>Ohio,</HI> at Fort Pitt, and the <HI>Laurel</HI> mountain, and thence continu|ing the same breadth from Fort Pitt to the Great Kan|hawa River, may, according to my own observations, and those of the late Mr. Gist, of Virginia, be generally, and justly described as follows.</P>
<P>The vallies adjoining to the branches of springs of the middle forks of <HI>Youghiogeny,</HI> are narrow towards its source, but there is a considerable quantity of good farming grounds on the hills, near the largest branch of that River. The lands within a small distance of the <HI>Laurel</HI> Mountain (through which the <HI>Youghiogeny</HI> runs) are in many places broken and stony, but <HI>rich</HI> and well timbered; and in some places, and particularly on <HI>Laurel</HI> Creek, they are rocky and mountainous.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Laurel</HI> Mountain, to <HI>Monongahela,</HI> the first seven miles are good, level farming grounds, with fine meadows; the timber, white Oak, Chesnut, Hickory, &amp;c. The same kind of land continues southerly (12 miles) to the upper branches or forks of this River, and about 15 miles notherly to the place where the <HI>Youghiogeny</HI> falls into the <HI>Monongahela</HI> &mdash;The lands, for about 18 miles in the same Course of the last mentioned River, on each side of it&punc; tho' hilly, are <HI>rich</HI> and well timbered &mdash;The trees are Walnut, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cust&punc; Chesnut, Poplar, and Sugar or sweet Maple.&mdash;The low lands, near the River, are about a mile,
<PB N="2" REF="020424_0006_0FAF104830B38398">
and in several places two miles wide.&mdash;For a considerable way down the River, on the eastern side of it, the intervals are extremely <HI>rich,</HI> and about a mile wide. The Upland for about 12 miles eastwardly, are uncommonly fertile, and well timbered;&mdash;the low lands, on the western side, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> narrow; but the Uplands, on the eastern side of the River, both up and down, are excellent, and covered with Sugar trees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such parts of the country which lie on some of the branches of the <HI>Monongabela,</HI> and across the heads of seve|ral Rivers, that run into the <HI>Ohio,</HI> tho' in general hilly, are exceedingly fruitful and well watered &mdash;The timber is Walnut, Chesnut, Ash, Oak, Sugar trees, &amp;c.&mdash;and the interval or meadow lands are from 250 yards to a quarter of a mile wide.</P>
<P>The lands lying nearly in a <HI>north-westerdly direction</HI> from the <HI>Great Kanbawa River</HI> to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and thence north-easterdly, and also upon <HI>Le Tort</HI>'s Creek, <HI>Little Kanhawa River, Buffaloe, Fishing, Weeling,</HI> and <HI>the two upper</HI> and <HI>two lower,</HI> and several other very considerable <HI>Creeks</HI> (or what, in Europe would be called large Rivers,) and thence east, and south east to the <HI>River Monongabela,</HI> are, in point of quality, as follows.</P>
<P>The borders or meadow lands, are a mile, and in some places near two miles wide; and the Uplands are in com|mon of a most fertil soil, capable of abundantly producing <HI>Wheat, Hemp, F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The lands which lie upon the <HI>Ohio,</HI> at the mouths of, and between the above <HI>Creeks,</HI> also consist of rich intervals and very fine farming grounds.&mdash;The whole country a|bounds in <HI>Bears, Elks, Buffaloe, Deer, Turkies,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;An unquestionable proof of the extraordinary goodness of its soil! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>India<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> as may be seen in my Map&punc; lies within the teritory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t contains about three millions and an half of Acres, and was granted to Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Warton, William Trent and George M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgan Esquires, and a few other persons, in the year 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Fort Pitt</HI> stands at the confluence of the <HI>Allegheny</HI> and <HI>Mon&oacute;ngabela</HI> Rivers; in latitude 40 31 44; and about five degrees <HI>westward</HI> of Philadelphia. In the year 1760, a small town, called <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilt near <HI>Fort Pitt,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="020424_0007_0FAF104AA2E92DF8">
and about 200 families resided in it; but upon the Indian war breaking out (in the month of May 1763.) They abandoned their houses, and retired into the fort.</P>
<P>In the year 1765 the present town of <HI>Pittsburgh</HI> was laid out. It is built on the eastern bank of the River <HI>Mononga|hela,</HI> about 200 yards from <HI>Fort Pitt.</HI></P>
<P>The junction of the <HI>Allegheny</HI> and <HI>Monongahela</HI> rivers, form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the River <HI>Ohio,</HI> and this discharges itself into the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> (in latitude 36 43) about 1188 computed miles from <HI>Fort Pitt.</HI> The <HI>Ohio</HI> in its passage to the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> glides thro' a pleasant, fruitful and healthy country;&mdash; and carries a great uniformity of breadth, from 400 to 600 yards, except at its confluence with the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and for 100 miles above it, where it is 1000 yards wide. The <HI>Ohi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> for the greater part of the way to the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> has many meanders, or windings, and rising grounds upon both sides of it.</P>
<P>The reaches in the <HI>Ohio</HI> are in some parts from two to four miles in length, and one of them, above the <HI>Muskingum</HI> River, called the <HI>Long Reach,</HI> is sixteen miles and a half long. The <HI>Ohio,</HI> about 100 miles <HI>above,</HI> or notherly of the <HI>Rapids,</HI> (formerly called the <HI>Falls</HI>) is in many places 700 yards wide; and as it approaches them, the <HI>high</HI> grounds on its borders gradually diminish, and the coun|try becomes more level. Some of the banks, or heights of this River, are at times overflowed by great freshes, yet there is scarce a place between <HI>Fort Pitt</HI> and the <HI>Rapids</HI> (a distance of 705 computed miles) where a good road may not be made; and horses employed in drawing up large barges (as is done on the margin of the River <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Seine</HI> in <HI>France</HI>) against a stream remark|ably gentle, except in high freshes. The heights of the banks of the <HI>Ohio</HI> admit them every where to be settled, as they are not liable to crumble away. And to these Re|marks, it may be proper to add the following observations of the ingenio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Mr. <HI>Lewis Evans,</HI> as published in the Analysis to his Map of the Middle Colonies of <HI>North Ame|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ica,</HI> in the year 1755.&mdash;He says, that the
<Q><HI>Ohio</HI> River, as the winter snows are thawed, by the warmth or rains in the spring, rises in vast floods, in some places. exceed|ing 20 feet in height, but <HI>scarce any where</HI> overflowing
<PB N="4" REF="020424_0008_0FAF104B94AF0758">
its <HI>high and upright banks.</HI> These floods, Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> adds, continue of some heigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for at least a month or two, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate or early breaking up of the winter. &mdash;Vessels from 100 to 200 tons burthen, by taking the advantage of these floods, may go from Pittsburg <HI>to the Sea</HI> with <HI>safety,</HI> as then the Falls, Rifts, and Shoals are covered to an equality with the rest of the River;</Q> &mdash;and tho' the distance is upwards of 2000 miles from <HI>Fort Pitt</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he sea, yet as there are no obstruc|tions, to prevent vessels from proceeding both day and night,&mdash; I am persuaded, that this extraordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Voyage may be performed, during the season of the floods, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owing, in sixteen or seventeen days.</P>
<P>The Navigation of the <HI>Ohio</HI> in a dry season, is rather troublesome <HI>from Fort Pitt to the Mingo town,</HI> (about seven|ty five miles) but from <HI>thence to the Missisippi,</HI> there is al|ways a sufficient depth of water for barges, carrying from 100 to 200 tons burthen, built in the manner as those are which are used on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Oxford</HI>;&mdash;to wit, from 100 to 120 feet in keel, sixteen to eighteen feet in breadth, and four feet in depth, and when loaded, drawing about three feet water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rapids</HI> in a <HI>dry</HI> season, are difficult to descend with <HI>loaded</HI> boats or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rges, without a good Pilot;&mdash;it would be adviseable therefore for the Bargemen, in such season, ra|ther than run any risk in passing them, to unload part of their cargoes, and reship it <HI>when the barges have got through the Rapids.</HI> It may, however&punc; be proper to observe, that loaded boats <HI>in freshes,</HI> have been easily rowed <HI>against</HI> the stream, (<HI>up the Rapids</HI>) and that others, by means, only, of a large sail, have ascended them.</P>
<P>In a <HI>dry</HI> season, the descent of the Rapids, in the distance of a mile, is about 12, or 15 feet, and the passage <HI>down,</HI> would not be difficult, except, prehaps, for the following reasons. Two miles above them, the River is deep, and three quarters of a mile broad;&mdash;but the <HI>channel</HI> is much contracted, and does not exceed 250 yards in breadth; (near three-fourths of the bed of the River, on the south eastern side of it&mdash;being filled with a flat Limestone rock, so that in a dry season, there is seldom more than 6 or 8 inches water) it is upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">thern side of the River and
<PB N="5" REF="020424_0009_0FAF104C0CF95D88">
being confined, as above mentioned; the descending wa|ters tumble over the <HI>Rapids</HI> with a considerable degree of celerity and force. The channel is of different depths, but no where, I think, less than 5 feet;&mdash;It is clear, and upon each side of it are large broken rocks, a few inches under water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Colonel GORDON, in his Journal <HI>down</HI> the Ohio mentions,
<Q>that these Falls do not deserve that Name as the Stream on the north side, has no sudden pitch, but only runs rapid over the ledge of a flat rock;&mdash;several boats, he says, passed it in the <HI>dryest season of the year</HI>; unloading one third of their freight. They passed on the north side, where the carrying-place is three quarters of a mile long. On the south-east side, it is about half that distance, and is reckoned the safest passage for those, who are unacquainted with it, but it is the most tedious, as during part of the summer, and Fall, the Bat|tomen drag their boats over the flat rock. The Fall is about half a mile rapid water, which however is passible, by wading and draging the boat against the stream, <HI>when lowest,</HI> and with still greater ease, when the water is raised a little.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>See the annexed Plan. It is a <HI>correct</HI> Description of these Rapids, made by the Editor, on the spot in the year 1766.</P></NOTE>. The <HI>Rapids</HI> are nearly in Latitude 38 8;&mdash;and the only Indian village (1766) on the banks of the <HI>Ohio</HI> River between them and <HI>Fort Pitt,</HI> was on the north-west side, 75 miles below <HI>Pittsburgh,</HI> called the <HI>Mingo</HI> town; it contained 60 families.</P>
<P>Most of the Hills on both sides of the <HI>Ohio</HI> are filled with excellent coal, and a coal mine was in the year 1760 open|ed opposite to <HI>Fort Pitt</HI> on the River <HI>Monongahela,</HI> for the use of that Garrison. <HI>Salt springs,</HI> as well as <HI>Iron Ore,</HI> and rich <HI>Lead Mines,</HI> are found bordering upon the River <HI>Ohio.</HI> One of the latter, is opened upon a branch of the <HI>Sioto,</HI> River, and there, the <HI>Indian</HI> natives supply themselves with a considerable part of the lead, which they use in their wars, and hunting.</P>
<P>About 584 miles below <HI>Fort Pitt,</HI> and on the eastern side of the <HI>Ohio</HI> River, about three miles from it, at the head of a small Creek or Run, where are several large and miry Salt Springs, are found numbers of large bones, teeth and tusk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, commonly supposed to be those of Elephants:&mdash; but the celebrated Doctor <HI>Hunter</HI> of London, in his inge|nious and curious Observations on these bones, &amp;c. has supposed them to belong to some Carnivorous animal, larg|er than an ordinary Elephant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Philosophical Transactions,</HI> 1768</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020424_0010_0FAF104CA8E9F7F0">On the North-Western side of <HI>Ohio,</HI> about 11 miles below the <HI>Cherokee</HI> River, on a high bank, are the remains of <HI>Fort Massac,</HI> built by the <HI>French,</HI> and intended as a check to the Southern Indians.

with more navigable rivers and branches communicating with the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> by the rivers <HI>Potowmack, Jamas, Rappahannock, Missisippi,</HI> and <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> or capable of producing with less labour and expence <HI>Wheat, Indian Corn, Buck-wheat, Rye, Oats, Barley, Flax, Hemp, Tobacco, Rice, Silk, Pot-ash,</HI> &amp;c. than the country under consideration. And although there are considerable quantities of high lands for about 250 miles (on both sides of the river <HI>Ohio) southwardly</HI> from <HI>Fort Pitt,</HI> yet even the summits of most of the Hills are covered with a deep rich soil, fit for the culture of Flax and Hemp, and it may also be added, that no soil can possibly yield larger crops of red and white Clover, and other useful grass, than this does.</P>
<P>On the <HI>North-west</HI> and <HI>South-east</HI> sides of the <HI>Ohio,</HI> be|low the <HI>Great Kanhawa</HI> River, at a little distance from it, are extensive natural meadows, or Savannahs. These meadows are from 20 to 50 miles in circuit. They have many beautiful groves of trees interspersed, as if by art in them, and which serve as a shelter for the innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erds of Buffaloe, Deer, &amp;c. with which they abound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am obliged to a worthy Friend, and Countryman, for the follow|ing just, and judicious observations. They were addressed to the Earl of Hillsborough, in the year 1770,&mdash;When Secretary of State for the North-American department.</P>
<Q><P>No part of North-America, he says, will require less encourage|ment for the production of naval stores, and raw materials for ma|nufactories in Europe; and for supplying the West-India island<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with <HI>Lumber, Provisions,</HI> &amp;c. than the country of the Ohio;&mdash;and for the following reasons:</P>
<P>First, The lands are excellent, the climate temperate, the native grapes, silk worms, and mulberry trees, abound every where: hemp, hops, and rye, grow spontaneously in the valleys and low lands, lead, and iron ore are plenty in the hills, salt springs are innumerable; and no Soil is better adapted to the culture of Tobacco, Flax and Cotton, than that of the Ohio.</P>
<P>Second, The country is well watered by several navigable Rivers, communicating with each other; by which, and a short land car|riage, the produce of the Lands of the Ohio can, even now, (in the year 1772) be sent cheaper to the Sea-port Town of Alexandria, on the River Potoma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k in Virginia (where General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raddock's Trans|ports landed his troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) than any kind of Merchandise, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sent from Northampton to London.</P>
<P>Third, The River Ohio is, at <HI>all seasons</HI> of the year, navigable with large boats, like the <HI>West Country Barges,</HI> rowed only by four or five men; and from the month of February to April large Ships may be built on the Ohio, and sent to <HI>Sea</HI> laden with Hemp, Iron, Flax, Silk, Tobacco, Cotton, Pot-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh, &amp;c.</P>

<P>By the <HI>Cherokee</HI> River, the emigrants from the frontier counties of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>North Carolina,</HI> pass to the settle|ments in <HI>West Florida</HI> upon the River <HI>Missisippi.</HI> They embark at <HI>Long Island.</HI></P>
<P>I now proceed to give a Description of that part of my Map called the <HI>Illinois country,</HI> lying between the <HI>Mssisippi</HI> westerly, the <HI>Illinois River</HI> northerly, the <HI>Wabash</HI> easter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and the <HI>Ohio</HI> southerly.</P>
<P>The land at the confluence, or <HI>Fork</HI> of the Rivers <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssi|sippi</HI> and <HI>Ohio,</HI> is above 20 feet higher than the common surface of these Rivers; yet so considerable are the <HI>Spring</HI> floods, that it is generally overflowed for about a week, as are the lands for several miles back in the country.&mdash;The soil at the <HI>Fork</HI> is composed of Mud, Earth and Sand, ac|cumulated from the <HI>Ohio</HI> and <HI>Missisippi</HI> Rivers. It is ex|ceedingly fertile, and in its natural state, yields Hemp, Pea-Vines, Grass, &amp;c. and a great variety of trees, and in particular, the Aspen Tree of an unusual height and thickness.</P>
<P>For 25 miles up the <HI>Missisippi</HI> (from the <HI>Ohio</HI>) the coun|try is rich, level and well timbered;&mdash;and then several gentle rising grounds appear, which gradually diminish at the distance of between four or five miles eastward from the River. From thence to the <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> River is 65 miles. The country is a mixture of hills and vallies; some of the former are rocky and steep;&mdash;but they, as well as the vallies, are shaded with fine Oaks, Hickory, Walnut, Ash and Mulberry trees, &amp;c. Some of the high grounds afford the most pleasant situations for settlements. Their elevated, and airy positions, together with the great luxuriance of the Soil, every where yielding plenty of Grass, and useful plants, promise health, and ample re|turns to industrious settlers.</P>
<P>Many quarries of <HI>Lime, Freestone,</HI> and <HI>Marble</HI> have been discovered in this part of the country.</P>
<P>Several Creeks, and Riv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs fall into the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> in the above distance (of 65 mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es) but no remarkable ones, ex|cept the Rivers <HI>a V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se</HI> and <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">skaskias</HI>;&mdash;the former is navigable for Battoes of about 60, and the latter for about

<P>The high grounds, just mentioned, continue along the eastern side of the <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> River at a small distance from it, for the space of five miles and a half, to the <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">skaskias</HI>
village; then they incline more towards that river, and run nearly parallel with the eastern bank of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssisippi,</HI> at the distance of about three miles in some parts, and four miles in other parts from it. These principally composed of Lime and Free stone, and are from 100 to 130 feet high, divided in several places by deep cavities, through which many small rivulets pass before they fall into the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> The sides of these hills fronting this River, are in many places perpendicular,&mdash;and appear like solid pieces of stone Masonry, of various colours, figures and sizes.</P>
<P>The low land between the Hills and the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> be|gins on the north side of the <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> River, and con|tinues for three miles above the River, <HI>Misouri,</HI> where a high ridge terminates it, and forms the eastern bank of the <HI>Missisippi.</HI>&mdash;This interval land is level, has few trees, and is of a very rich soil, yielding shrubs and most fragrant flowers, which added to the number and extent of meadows and ponds dispersed thro' this charming valey, render it exceedingly beautiful and agreeable.</P>
<P>In this vale stand the following villages, viz. <HI>Kaskaskias,</HI> which, as already mentioned, is five miles and a half up a River of the same name, running northerly and southerly. This village contains 80 houses, many of them well built; several of stone, with gardens, and large lots adjoining. It consists of about 500 white inhabitants, and between four and five hundred negroes. The former have large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ocks of Black Cattle, Swine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Three miles northerly of <HI>Kaskaskias,</HI> is a village of <HI>Illi|nois Indians,</HI> (of the <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> tribe) containing about 210 persons and 60 warriors. They were formerly brave and warlike, but are degenerated into a drunken, and de|bauched tribe, and so indolent, as scarcely to procure a suf|ficiency of Skins and Furrs to barter for cloathing.</P>
<P>Nine miles further northward, than the last mentioned
<PB N="18" REF="020424_0023_0FAF1058B3158F78">
village, is another, called <HI>La prairie du Rocher,</HI> or (the <HI>Rock meadows.</HI>) It consists of 100 white inhabitants and 80 negroes.</P>
<P>Three miles northerly of this place, on the banks of the <HI>Missisippi</HI> stood <HI>Fort Chartres.</HI> It was abandoned in the year 1772, as it was rendered untenable by the constant wash|ings of the River <HI>Missisippi</HI> in high floods.&mdash;The village of <HI>Fort Chartres,</HI> a little southward of the Fort,&mdash;contained so few inhabitants, as not to deserve my notice.</P>
<P>One mile higher up the <HI>Missisippi</HI> than <HI>Fort Chartres,</HI> is a village settled by 170 warriors of the <HI>Piorias</HI> and <HI>Mitchi|gamias</HI> (two other tribes of the <HI>Illinois Indians.</HI>) They are as idle and debauched, as the tribe of <HI>Kaskaskias,</HI> which I have just described.</P>
<P>Four miles higher than the preceding village, is <HI>St. Philips.</HI> It was formerly inhabited by about a dozen fa|milies, but at present, is possessed only by two or three.&mdash;The others have retired to the western side of the <HI>Missisippi.</HI>&mdash; Forty-five miles further northward, than <HI>St. Philips</HI> (and one mile up a small River, on the southern side of it) stands the village of <HI>Cahokia.</HI> It has 50 houses&punc; many of them well built, and 300 inhabitants, possessing 80 negroes, and large stocks of black Cattle, Swine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Four miles above <HI>Cahokia,</HI> on the western, or <HI>Spanish</HI> side of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> stands the village of St. <HI>Louis</HI> on a high piece of ground. It is the most healthy and pleasur|able situation of any known in this part of the country. Here the <HI>Spanish</HI> Commandant, and the principal <HI>Indian</HI> Traders reside; who by concilating the affections of the natives, have drawn all the <HI>Indian</HI> trade of the <HI>Misouri,</HI> part of that of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> and of the tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> residing near the <HI>Ouisconsing,</HI> and <HI>Illinoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rivers,</HI> to this village.

The <HI>Ridge</HI> which form, the eastern bank of the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> above the <HI>Misouri</HI> River, continues northerly to the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, and then directs its course along the eastern side of that River, for about 220 miles, when it declines, in gentle slopes, and ends in extensive rich savannahs. On the top of this <HI>Ridge,</HI> at the mouth of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, is an a|greeable and commanding situation, for a fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and tho' the <HI>Ridge</HI> is high and steep (about 130 feet high) and ra|ther difficult to ascend; yet when ascended, it affords a most delightful prospect. The <HI>Missisippi</HI> is distinctly seen from its summit for more than twenty miles, as are the beautiful meanderings of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, for many leagues; next a level, fruitful meadow presents itself, of at least one hundred miles in circuit on the western side of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssisippi,</HI> watered by several lakes, and shaded by small groves of copses of trees, scattered in different parts of it, and then the eye, with rapture, surveys, as well the high lands bordering upon the River <HI>Misouri,</HI> as those at a great|er distance up the <HI>Missisippi,</HI>&mdash;In fine, this charming ridge is covered with excellent Grass, large Oak, Walnut trees, &amp;c. and at the distance of about nine miles from the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> up the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, are seen many large savan|nahs, or meadows abounding in Buffaloe, Deer, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="020424_0025_0FAF105A74A7F718">In ascending the <HI>Missisippi, Cape au Gres,</HI> particularly attracted my attention.

<P>The <HI>Illinois</HI> River furnishes a communication with Lake <HI>Michigan,</HI> by the <HI>Chicago</HI> River, and by two portages be|tween the latter and the <HI>Illinois</HI> River; the longest of which does not exceed four miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Illinois</HI> country is in general of a superior soil to any other part of North America that I have seen. It pro|duces fine Oak, Hickory, Cedar, Mulberry trees, &amp;c. some <HI>Dying</HI> roots and medecinal Plants; Hops, and ex|cellent wild grapes, and in the year 1769, one hundred and ten hogsheads of well tasted and strong Wine, were made by the <HI>French</HI> settlers, from these Grapes.</P>
<P>A large quantity of Sugar is also annually made from the juce of the Maple tree; and as the Mulberry trees are large and numerous, I presume the making of Silk will employ the attention and industry of the settlers, when the country is more fully inhabited than at present, and especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the winters are much more moderate, and favourable for the breed of Silk Worms, than they are in many of the sea coast provinces. <HI>Indigo</HI> may likewise be successfully cultivated, (but not more than two cuttings in

<P><HI>Lake Erie,</HI> is about 225 miles in length, and upon a medium about 40 miles in breadth. It affords a good na|vigation for shipping of <HI>any</HI> burthen.

<P>JULY 23, 1773.
We set out form <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> in search of a Copper mine, and on the 31st reached the Illi|nois River; it is 84 miles from <HI>Kask&aacute;skias.</HI> The same day we entered the <HI>Illinois</HI> River which is 18 miles a|bove that of the <HI>Missouri.</HI> The water was so low, and the sides of the river so full of weeds, that our progress was much interrupted, being obliged to row our boat in the deep water, and strong current. The chain of rocks, and high hills which begin at the <HI>Piasas</HI> about three miles above the <HI>Missouri,</HI> extend to the mouth of the Illinois River, and continue along the south-eastern side of the same in an east-north-east course. About eigh|teen miles up this river, on the eastern side, is a little river called by the natives <HI>Macopin</HI> or <HI>White Potato</HI> Riv|er; it is 20 yards wide, and navigable nine miles to the hills. The shore is low on both sides; the timber, <HI>Bois connu,</HI> or <HI>Paccan, Maple, Ash, Button wood,</HI> &amp;c. The course of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River here, is N. N, E; the land is well timbered, and covered with high weeds. There are fine meadows at a little distance from the riv|er; the banks of which do not crumble away as those of the <HI>Missisippi</HI> do: we passed numbers of Islands, some

<P>August 1, about 12 o'clock, we stopped at the <HI>Piorias</HI> wintering ground. About a quarter of a mile from the River, on the eastern side of it, is a meadow of many miles long, and five or six miles broad. In this meadow are many small lakes, communicating with each other, and by which there are passages for small boats or canoes and one in particular, leads to the <HI>Illinois</HI> River. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mber in general very tall Oaks. We met with some beautiful islands in this part of the River (48 miles from the <HI>Missisippi</HI>) and great plenty of Buffaloe and Deer.</P>

<P>August 4, Here the land on both sides of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River is low, but rises gradually. The <HI>Prairie</HI>&punc; or meadow ground on the eastern side, is at least twenty miles wide; it is fine land for tillage, or for grazing cattle, and is well watered with a number of springs. About 12 o'clock we passed the River <HI>Sag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mond,</HI> 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> It is a River 100 ya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds wide, and navigable for small boats or canoes upwards of 180 miles, and about sunset, we passed the River <HI>Demi-Quian</HI> It comes in on the western side of the <HI>Illinos,</HI> River; (165 miles from the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssisippi</HI>;) is 50 yards wide, and navigable 120 miles. We encamped on the south eastern side of the <HI>Illinois</HI> river, opposite to a very large savannah, belonging to and called, the
<PB N="26" REF="020424_0031_0FAF106034D23B68">
<HI>Demi-Quian</HI> swamp. The lands on the south-eastern side are high and thinly timbered; but at the place of our encampment are fine meadows, extending farthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than the eye can reach, and affording a delightful pro|spect. The low lands on the western side of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, extend so far back from it that no high grounds can be seen. Here is plenty of Buffaloe, Deer, Elk, Turkies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>August 5, It rained all day, which detained us till the evening, when we embarked, and rowed till dark; in our way we passed the Lake <HI>Demi-Quian,</HI> 200 yards west from the river of that name, it is a circular figure, six miles across, and discharges itself by a small passage, four feet deep into the <HI>Illinois</HI> River. This Lake is 171 miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> The general course of the <HI>Illinois River</HI> varies very little; it rather however inclines to the eastward. The lands are much the same as before described, only the <HI>Prairies</HI> (Meadows) ex|tend further from the river by our reckoning, we are 177 miles from the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssisippi.</HI></P>
<P>August 6. Set out early, and at 11 o'Clock we pas|sed the <HI>Seseme Quian</HI> river, it is on the western si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the <HI>Illinois</HI> river; is 40 yards wide, and navigable 60 miles; the land bordering on this river is very good. About four o'clock we passed the river <HI>De la March,</HI> (on the western side also of the <HI>Illinois</HI> river;) it is 30 yards wide, and navigable about eight or nine miles only. Though the <HI>De la March</HI> is not so long as the <HI>Seseme Quian,</HI> yet it is much hansomer. These rivers are about nine miles distant from each other. Here the land begins to rise gradually on the western bank. At sun set we passed a river called <HI>Michilimackinac.</HI> It is on the south-eastern side of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River; is 50 yards wide, navigable for about 90 miles, and has betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n 30 and 40 small islands at its mouth; which at a distance ap|pear like a small v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llage.

This river is 195 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the <HI>Missippi.</HI></P>
<P>August 7, The morning being very foggy, and the River overgrown with weeds along its sides, we could make but little way. About 12 o'clock we got to the old <HI>Pioria Fort</HI> and village on the western shore of the Riv|er, and at the southern end of the lake called the <HI>Illinois Lake</HI>; which is 19 miles and a half in length, and three miles in breadth. It has no Rocks, Shoals or per|ceivable Current. We found the stockades of this <HI>Pioria Fort</HI> destroyed by fire, but the houses standing. The summit on which the Fort stood, commands a fine prospect of the country to the eastward, and up the lake to the point, where the River comes in at the north end; to the westward are large meadows. In the lake is great plenty of fish, and in particular, <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> and <HI>Picannau.</HI> On the eastern side of the lake, about the middle of it, the chain of Rocks, that extends from the back of <HI>Kaskaskias,</HI> to <HI>Cahokia Piasa,</HI> the mouth of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, &amp;c. terminates. The Country to the westward, is low and very level, covered with Grass, Weeds, Flags, &amp;c. Here is abundance of Cherry, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umb and other fruit trees. This lake is 210 miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI></P>
<P>August 8, The wind being fair we made a sail of our tent, and reached the upper end of the lake by sun set; and the wind continuing fair we ascended the River, and about 4 o'clock passed <HI>Crows Meadows River,</HI> which comes from the eastward, and over against it, on the west side, are the meadows just mentioned, 240 miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> This River is twenty yards wide, and navigable between 15 and 18 miles. The land on both sides of the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, for 27 or 30 miles above the lake, is generally low and full of Swamps, some a mile wide, bordered with fine meadows, and in some places, the high land comes to the River in points, or narrow necks.</P>

After passing this River, which is 255 miles from the <HI>Missisippi,</HI> we found the water very shallow, and it was with difficulty that we got forward, though we employed seven oars, and our boat drew only three feet water. The grass which grows in the interval or mea|dow ground, between the <HI>Illinois</HI> River and the <HI>Rocks,</HI> is finer than any we have seen, and is thicker and higher and more clear from weeds, than in any of the meadows about <HI>Kaskaskias</HI> or Fort <HI>Chartres.</HI> The timber is gene|rally <HI>Birch, Button,</HI> and <HI>Paccan.</HI> &mdash;The wind continuing fair, about 10 o'clock we passed the <HI>Vermillion River,</HI> 267 miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> It is 30 yards wide, but so rocky as not to be navigable. At the distance of a mile further, we arrived at the little rocks, which are 60 miles from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> 270 miles from the <HI>Missisippi.</HI> The water being very low, we could get no further with our boat, and therefore we proceeded by land to the <HI>Forks.</HI> We set out about two o'clock on the western side of the River, but the grass and weeds were so high, that we could make but little way.</P>
<P>August 10, We crossed the high land, at ten o'clock we came to the <HI>Fox River</HI> (or a branch of it) after walking twenty-four miles. It falls into the <HI>Illinois</HI> River, thirty miles beyond the place where we left our boat. The <HI>Fox</HI> River is 25 yards wide, and has about five feet water; its course is from the westward by many windings through large meadows. At three miles dis|tance, after crossing this river, we fell in with the <HI>Illinois</HI> River again, and kept along its bank; here we found a path. About six o'clock we arrived, after walking about 12 miles, at an old encampment, fifteen miles from the <HI>Fork.</HI> The land is stoney, and the meadows not so good as some which we formerly passed;&mdash;from hence we went to an island, where several <HI>French</HI> traders were e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">camp'd, but we could get no intelligence from them about the <HI>copper mine</HI> which we had set out in search of.

August 11, We set off about three o'clock, and at night got within nine miles of our boat. We computed it to be 45 miles from the island we last departed from, to the place where we left our boat.</P>
<P>August 12, We embarked early, and proceeded three miles down the <HI>Illinois</HI> River. On the north-wes|tern side of this river is a coal <HI>mine,</HI> that extends for half a mile along the middle of the bank of the river, which is high. On the eastern side, about half a mile from it, and about the same distance below the coal mine, are two salt ponds, 100 yards in circumference, and several feet in depth; the water is stagnant, and of a yellowish colour; but the <HI>French,</HI> and natives make good salt from it.

The land along the banks of the river is much better than what we meet with, when we crossed the country on the 10th of this month. On the high lands, and particularly those on the south-eastern side, there is abundance of red and white Cedar, Pine trees, &amp;c. We embarked about two o'clock, and proceeded till nine at night.</P>
<P>August 13, We lay by half this day, on account of wet weather.</P>

<P>August 16, Embarked early, and ascended the <HI>Mine</HI> River in a small canoe, about 6 miles, but could get no further, as the river was quite dry a little higher up. It runs the above distance, through very high grounds, is
