<P>THE pieces now collected and printed in the follow|ing sheets, were left in my hands, by the author, above a year ago, with permission to publish them when|ever I thought proper. A considerable number of the performances contained in this volume, as many will re|collect, have appeared at different times in Newspapers, (particularly the Freeman's Journal) and other periodi|cal publications in the different Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of America, dur|ing the late war, and since; and from the avidity and pleasure with which they generally appear to have been read by persons of the best taste, the Printer now the more readily gives them to the world in their present form, (without troubling the reader with any affected apologies for their supposed or real imperfections) in hopes they will afford a high degree of satisfaction to the lovers of poetical wit, and elegance of expression.</P>

<HEAD>THE POETICAL HISTORY OF THE PROPHET JONAH.</HEAD>
<P>&rindx; This is rather to be considered as a paraphrase upon, than a mere versification of the story as related in the Bible. Done in the year 1768.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<L>IN ages past, when smit with warmth sublime,</L>
<L>Their bards foretold the dark events of time,</L>
<L>And, piercing forward through the mystic shade,</L>
<L>Kings yet to come, and chiefs unborn, survey'd,</L>
<L><HI>Amittai</HI>'s son perceiv'd, among the rest,</L>
<L>The mighty flame usurp his labouring breast:&mdash;</L>
<L>For thus, in dreams, the voice unerring came</L>
<L>Of HIM, who lives through every age the same:</L>
<L>"ARISE! and o'er the intervening waste,</L>
<L>"To Nineveh's imperial turrets haste;</L>
<L>"That mighty town to ruin I decree,</L>
<L>"Proclaim destruction, and proclaim from me:</L>
<L>"Too long it stands, to GOD and man a foe,</L>
<L>"Without one virtue left to shield the blow;</L>
<L>"Guilt, black as night, their speedy ruin brings,</L>
<L>"And hottest vengeance from the KING of KINGS."</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="019658_0008_0FAC97B0E0593448">The prophet heard&mdash;but dar'd to disobey,</L>
<L>(Weak as he was) and fled a different way;</L>
<L>In Joppa's port a trading ship he found</L>
<L>Far o'er the main to distant Tarshish bound;</L>
<L>The price of passage to her chief he paid,</L>
<L>And there conceal'd with ruffian sailors stay'd,</L>
<L>His purpose fixt, at once perverse and blind,</L>
<L>To leave his country, and his GOD behind.</L>
<L>BUT HE who spread the ocean's vast expanse,</L>
<L>And views all nature with a single glance,</L>
<L>Forth from their prisons bade the tempests fly&mdash;</L>
<L>The tempests swell'd the ocean to the sky;</L>
<L>The trembling barque, as the fierce billow knocks,</L>
<L>Scarce bears the fury of repeated shocks;</L>
<L>Her crew distrest, astonish'd and afraid,</L>
<L>Each to his various god in anguish pray'd,</L>
<L>Nor trust alone to penitence and prayer,</L>
<L>They clear the deck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and for the worst prepare,</L>
<L>The costly lading to the deep they throw,</L>
<L>That lighter o'er the billows she may go,</L>
<L>Nor with regret the wealthy cargo spar'd,</L>
<L>For wealth is nothing, when with life compar'd.</L>
<L>BUT to the ship's remotest chambers fled</L>
<L>There pensive Jonah droop'd his languid head,</L>
<L>And, new to all the dangers of the deep,</L>
<L>Had sunk, dejected, in the arms of sleep&mdash;</L>
<L>'Twas then the master broke the prophet's rest,</L>
<L>And as he cry'd, he smote his frantic breast&mdash;</L>
<L>"O sleeper, from thy stupid slumbers rise,</L>
<L>"At such an hour can sleep invade thine eyes?&mdash;</L>
<L>"If ever thou to heaven didst send a prayer,</L>
<L>"Now send thy warmest supplications there,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="019658_0009_0FAC97B1A3745AE0">"Perhaps thy God may pity our distress,</L>
<L>"And save us, foundering in this dark abyss."</L>
<L>THUS warn'd, the seer his vows repentant pay'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Meantime, the seamen to their fellows said;</L>
<L>"No common waves our shatter'd vessel rent,</L>
<L>"There must be <HI>one</HI> for whom this storm is sent,</L>
<L>"Some wretch we bear, for whom these billows rise,</L>
<L>"Foe to the gods, and hated by the skies;</L>
<L>"Come, since the billows all our arts defy,</L>
<L>"Come, let the lot decide for whom we die."</L>
<L>INSTANT the lots amid the vase they threw,</L>
<L>And the markt lot dejected Jonah drew!</L>
<L>THEN thus their chief the guilty man addrest,</L>
<L>"Say, for what crimes of thine are we distrest?</L>
<L>"What is thy country, what thy calling, say,</L>
<L>"Whence dost thou come, what potentate obey?</L>
<L>"Unfold it all, nor be the truth deny'd."&mdash;</L>
<L>The master spoke&mdash;and Jonah thus reply'd:</L>
<L>"A HEBREW I, from neighbouring regions came,</L>
<L>"A Jewish prophet, not unknown to fame;</L>
<L>"That God I fear who spread this raging sea,</L>
<L>"Who fixt the shores by his supreme decree,</L>
<L>"And reigns throughout immeasurable space,</L>
<L>"His footstool earth, the heaven his dwelling place.</L>
<L>"But I, regardless of his high command,</L>
<L>"His mandate s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighting, fled my native land,</L>
<L>"Fool that I was, from Joppa's port to fly,</L>
<L>"Who thought to shun his all pervading eye!&mdash;</L>
<L>"For this the tempest rends each tatter'd sail,</L>
<L>"For this, your vessel scarce supports the gale!"</L>
<L>THE seamen heard, distracted and dismay'd;</L>
<L>When thus again their trembling captain said;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="019658_0010_0FAC97B260A0FF30">"How consist thou thus, ungenerous as thou art,</L>
<L>"Affront thy patron, and with us depart;&mdash;</L>
<L>"Lo! for thy crimes, and not our own, we die;</L>

<L>"Our sails in fragments flit before the blast,</L>
<L>"Scarce to its station we confine the mast;</L>
<L>"What shall we do, unhappy man declare,</L>
<L>"How shall we act, or how direct our prayer,</L>
<L>"That angry Neptune may his rage restrain,</L>
<L>"And hush once more these tumults of the main?"</L>
<L>THE seer reply'd, "The means are in your power</L>
<L>"To still the tempest in this dreadful hour:&mdash;</L>
<L>"High on the sea-beat prow will I ascend,</L>
<L>"And let the boldest of your crew attend</L>
<L>"To plunge me headlong from that giddy steep</L>
<L>"Down to the bosom of the unfathom'd deep;</L>
<L>"So shall the ocean from its raging cease,</L>
<L>"And the fierce tempest soon be hush'd in peace:&mdash;</L>
<L>"'Tis for my crime this angry ocean raves,</L>
<L>"'Tis for my sin we plough these fearful waves;</L>
<L>"Dislodge me soon&mdash;the storm shall then decay,</L>
<L>"Which still grows louder while on board I stay."</L>

<L>And though aloft on mountain waves they ride,</L>
<L>And the tost galley reels from side to side,</L>
<L>Yet to their breasts they drew the sweepy oar,</L>
<L>And vainly strove to gain the distant shore;</L>
<L>The ruffian winds refuse that wish'd retreat,</L>
<L>And fiercer o'er the deck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the billows beat,</L>
<L>THEN to the skies the chief his praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> addrest,</L>

<L>"And thou hast done as it seem'd best to thee."</L>
<L>THEN from the summit of the washy prow,</L>

<L>ONCE more the voice to humbled Jonah came</L>

<L>Obedient to JEHOVAH'S high command,</L>
<L>The Prophet rose, and left Judea's land,</L>
<L>And now he near the spiry city drew,</L>
<L>(Euphrates pass'd, and rapid Tigris too,)</L>
<L>So vast the bulk of this prodigious place</L>
<L>Three days were scant its lengthy streets to trace;</L>
<L>But as he enter'd, on the first sad day,</L>

<L>"Such is the vengeance that the heavens decree,</L>

<L>THE people heard, and smit with instant fear,</L>

<HEAD>THE MONUMENT OF PHAON.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Written 1770.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Phaon, the admirer of Sappho, both of the isle of Lesbos, pri|vately forsook this first object of his affections, and sat out to visit foreign countries. Sappho, after having long mourned his absence (which is the subject of one of Ovid's finest epistles) is here supposed to fall into the company of Ismenius a travel|ler, who informs her that he saw the tomb of a certain Phaon in Sicily, erected to his memory by a lady of the island, and gives her the inscriptions, hinting to her that, in all probability, it belonged to the same person she bemoans. She thereupon, in a fit of rage and despair, throws herself from the famous Leu|cadian rock, and perishes in the gulph below.</P>

<P>Columbus was a considerable number of years engaged in solicit|ing the court of Spain to fit him out, in order to discover a new continent, which he imagined existed somewhere in the western parts of the ocean. During his negotiations, he is here sup|posed to address king Ferdinand in the following Stanzas.</P>

<HEAD>THE HOUSE OF NIGHT: A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>ADVERTISEMENT&mdash;This Poem is founded upon the au|thority of Scripture, inasmuch as these sacred books assert, that <HI>the last enemy that shall be conquered is Death.</HI> For the purposes of poetry he is here personified, and represented as on his dying bed. The scene is laid at a solitary palace, (the time midnight) which, tho' before beautiful and joyous, is now become sad and gloomy, as being the abode and receptacle of Death. Its owner, an ami|able majestic youth, who had lately lost a beloved consort, never|theless with a noble philosophical fortitude and humanity enter|tains him in a friendly manner, and by employing Physicians, en|deavours to restore him to health, altho' an enemy; convinced of the excellence and propriety of that divine precept, <HI>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink.</HI> He nevertheless, as if by a spirit of prophecy, informs this (fictitiously) wicked being of the certainty of his doom, and represents to him in a pathetic manner the vanity of his expectations, either of a reception into the abodes of the just, or continuing longer to make havock of mankind upon earth. The patient finding his end approaching, composes his epitaph, and orders it to be engraved on his tomb|stone, hinting to us thereby, that even Death and Distress have vanity; and would be remembered with honour after he is no more, altho' his whole life has been spent in deeds of devastation and murder. He dies at last in the utmost agonies of despair, after agreeing with an avaricious Undertaker to intomb his bones. This reflects upon the inhumanity of those men, who, not to mention an enemy, would scarcely cover a departed friend with a little dust, without certainty of reward for so doing. The circumstances of his funeral are then recited, and the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears. It conclude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a few reflexions on the impropriety of a too great attachment to the present life, and in|centives to such moral virtue a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may assist in conducting us to a better.</P>

<SPEAKER>King G.</SPEAKER>
<L>GOOD master Fox, your counsel I implore,</L>
<L>Still George the third, but potent George no more.</L>
<L>By North conducted to the brink of fate,</L>
<L>I mourn my folly and my pride too late:</L>
<L>The promises he made, when once we met</L>
<L>In Kew's gay shades <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The royal gardens at Kew.</NOTE>, I never shall forget,</L>
<L>That at my feet the western world should fall.</L>
<L>And bow to me the potent lord of all&mdash;</L>
<L>Curse on his hopes, his councils and his schemes,</L>
<L>His plans of conquest, and his golden dreams,</L>
<L>These have allur'd me to the jaws of hell,</L>
<L>By Satan tempted thus Iscariot fell:</L>
<L>Divested of majestic pomp I come,</L>
<L>My royal robes and airs I've left at home,</L>
<L>Speak freely, friend, whate'er you choose to say,</L>
<L>Suppose me equal with yourself to-day:</L>
<L>How shall I shun the mischiefs that impend?</L>
<L>How shall I make Columbia <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">America, so called, by poetical liberty, from its discoverer.</NOTE> yet my friend?</L>

<L>Advise me quick, for doubtful while we stand,</L>

<L>ASSIST me, CLIO! while in verse I tell</L>
<L>The dire misfortunes that a ship befell,</L>
<L>Which outward bound, to St. Eustatia's shore,</L>
<L>Death and disaster through the billows bore.</L>
<L>FROM Philadelphia's crowded port she came;</L>
<L>For there the builder plann'd her lofty frame,</L>
<L>With wond'rous skill, and excellence of art</L>

<L>With joy be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eld the stately fabric rise</L>
<L>To a stout bulwark of stupendous size,</L>
<L>'Till launch'd at last, capacious of the freight,</L>
<L>He left her to the Pilots, and her fate.</L>
<L>FIRST from her depths the tapering masts ascend,</L>
<L>On whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend,</L>
<L>By shrouds and stays secur'd from side to side</L>
<L>Trees grew on trees, suspended o'er the tide,</L>
<L>Firm to the yards extended, broad and vast</L>
<L>They hung the sails susceptive of the blast,</L>
<L>Far o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay,</L>
<L>Supporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay,</L>
<L>Twice ten six pounders at their port holes plac'd</L>
<L>And rang'd in rows, stood hostile in the waist:</L>
<L>Thus all prepar'd, impatient for the seas,</L>
<L>She left her station with an adverse breeze,</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="019658_0193_0FAC987620DC5698">This her first outset from her native shore,</L>
<L>To seas a stranger, and untry'd before.</L>
<L>FROM the bright radiance that his glories spread</L>
<L>Ere from the east gay Phoebus lifts his head,</L>
<L>From the sweet morn, a kindred name she won,</L>
<L>AURORA call'd, the offspring of the sun,</L>
<L>Whose form projecting, the broad prow displays,</L>
<L>Far glittering o'er the wave, a mimic blaze.</L>
<L>THE gay ship now, in all her pomp and pride,</L>
<L>With sails expanded, flew along the tide;</L>
<L>'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware, that bore</L>
<L>This pile intended for a southern shore,</L>
<L>Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns,</L>
<L>Fair fruits, gay blossoms, and enamell'd plains;</L>
<L>Where sloping lawns the roving swain invite;</L>
<L>And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night,</L>
<L>Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings</L>

<L>Then east-south-east explor'd the briny way,</L>
<L>Close to the wind, departing from the bay;</L>
<L>No longer seen the hoarse resounding strand,</L>
<L>With hearts elate we hurried from the land,</L>

<L>To sailors fatal, and for wrecks renown'd&mdash;</L>
<L>THE gale increases as we stem the main,</L>
<L>Now scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain,</L>
<L>At last they sink beneath the rolling wave</L>
<L>That seems their summits, as they sink, to lave;</L>
<L>Abaft the beam the freshening breezes play,</L>
<L>No mists advancing to deform the day,</L>

<L>Shores disappear'd, and every hill withdrew,</L>

<L>Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe,</L>
<L>Her spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow</L>
<L>When to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste</L>
<L>And her lee-guns lay delug'd in the waste:</L>
<L>From her top-gallant flow'd an <HI>English Jack</HI>;</L>
<L>With all her might she strove to gain our track,</L>
<L>Nor strove in vain&mdash;with pride and power elate</L>

<L>Nor oaths, nor prayers arrest her swift career,</L>
<L>Death in her front, and ruin in her rear.</L>

<L>Swift to the task the ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> run,</L>
<L>And while the word was utter'd, half was done,</L>
<L>As from the south the fiercer breezes rise</L>

<L>And trust her swiftness rather than her force,</L>
<L>Unfit to combat with a powerful foe;</L>
<L>Her decks too open, and her <HI>waist</HI> too low.</L>
<L>WHILE o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,</L>

<HEAD>COPY OF AN INTERCEPTED LETTER FROM A <HI>New-York</HI> TORY, to his friend in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEAR Sir, I am so anxious to hear of your health,</L>
<L>I beg you would send me a letter by stealth:</L>
<L>I hope a few months will quite alter the case,</L>
<L>When the wars are concluded we'll meet and embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="215" REF="019658_0221_0FAC981860D8A930">
<L>For I'm led to believe from our brilliant success,</L>
<L>And what is as clear, your amazing distress,</L>
<L>That the cause of rebellion has met with a check</L>
<L>That will bring all its patrons to hang by the neck.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cornwallis has manag'd so well in the South</L>
<L>That those rebels want victuals to put in their mouth,</L>
<L>And Arnold has stript them, we hear, to the buff&mdash;</L>
<L>Has burnt their tobacco, and left them&mdash;the snuff.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear Thomas, I wish you would move from that town</L>
<L>Where meet all the rebels of fame and renown;</L>
<L>When our armies victorious shall clear that damn'd nest</L>
<L>You may chance, though a Tory, to swing with the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But again&mdash;on reflection&mdash;I beg you would stay&mdash;</L>
<L>You may serve us yet better than if mov'd away&mdash;</L>
<L>Give advice to Sir Harry of all that is passing,</L>
<L>What vessels are building, what cargoes amassing;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inform to a day when those vessels will sail</L>
<L>That our cruisers may capture them all without fail&mdash;</L>
<L>By proceedings like these your peace shall be made,</L>
<L>The rebellious shall swing, but be you ne'er afraid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I cannot conceive how you do to subsist&mdash;</L>
<L>The rebels are starving, except those who 'list,</L>
<L>And as you reside in the land of Gomorrah,</L>
<L>You must fare as the rest do, I think, to your sorrow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor souls! if ye knew what a doom is decreed,</L>
<L>(I mean not for you but for rebels indeed)</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="019658_0222_0FAC981920CAD620">You would tremble to think of the vengeance in store,</L>
<L>The halters and gibbets&mdash;I mention no more.</L>

<L>The rebels must surely conclude they're undone,</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM Lord CORNWALLIS to Sir HENRY CLINTON.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>October,</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<L>FROM clouds of smoke, and flames that round me glow,</L>
<L>To you, dear Clinton, I disclose my woe:</L>
<L>Here cannons flash, bombs glance, and bullets fly;</L>
<L>Not Satan's self endures such misery.</L>
<L>Was I foredoom'd, like Korah, to expire,</L>
<L>Hurl'd to perdition in a blaze of fire?</L>
<L>With these blue flames can mortal man contend&mdash;</L>
<L>What arms can aid me, or what walls defend?</L>
<L>Even to these gates last night a phantom strode,</L>
<L>And hail'd me trembling to his dark abode:</L>
<L>Aghast I stood, struck motionless and dumb,</L>
<L>Seiz'd with the horrors of the world to come.</L>
<L>WERE but my power as mighty as my rage,</L>
<L>Far different battles would Cornwallis wage;</L>
<L>Beneath his sword yon' threat'ning hosts should groan,</L>
<L>The earth should quake with thunders all his own.</L>
<L>O crocodile! had I thy flinty hide,</L>
<L>Swords to defy, and glance the ball<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> aside,</L>
<L>By my own prowess would I rout the foe,</L>
<L>With my own javelin would I work their woe&mdash;</L>
<L>But fate's averse, and heaven's supreme decree</L>
<L>Nile's serpent form'd more excellent than me.</L>
<L>HAS heaven in secret for some crime decreed</L>

<L>There a strict rule the wakeful Frenchman keeps;</L>

<L>Bespatter'd still, be-devil'd, and bely'd;</L>
<L>With the first chance that favouring fortune sends</L>

<L>And mourn'd the hard fate of the peerless maid.</L>

<L>At length from hell's dark chambers Merlin came</L>

<LG>
<L>LONG life and low spirits were never my choice,</L>
<L>As long as I live I intend to rejoice;</L>
<L>When life is worn out, and no wine's to be had</L>
<L>'Tis time enough then to be serious and sad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis time enough then to reflect and repent</L>
<L>When our liquor is gone, and our money is spent,</L>
<L>But I cannot endure what is practis'd by some</L>
<L>This anticipating of evils to come:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A debt must be paid, I am sorry to say,</L>
<L>Alike, in their turns, by the grave and the gay,</L>
<L>And due to a despot that none can deceive</L>
<L>Who grants us no respite and signs no reprieve.</L>

<L>Thrice happy is he that from care can retreat,</L>
<L>And its plagues and vexations put under his feet;</L>
<L>Blow the storm as it may, he is always in trim,</L>
<L>And the sun's in the zenith forever to him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since the world then in earnest is nothing but care,</L>
<L>(And the world will allow I have also my share)</L>
<L>Yet, toss'd as I am in the stormy expanse,</L>
<L>The best way, I find, is to leave it to chance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look round, if you please, and survey the wide ball</L>
<L>And chance, you will find, has direction of all:</L>
<L>'Twas owing to <HI>chance</HI> that I first saw the light,</L>
<L>And chance may destroy me before it is night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas a chance, a mere chance, that your arms gain'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> day</L>
<L>'Twas a chance that the Britons so soon went away,</L>
<L>To chance by their leaders the nation is cast</L>
<L>And chance to perdition will send them at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now because I remain when the puppies are gone</L>
<L>You would willingly see me hang'd quarter'd and drawn</L>
<L>Though I think I have logic sufficient to prove</L>
<L>That the <HI>chance</HI> of my stay&mdash;is a proof of my love.</L>

<L>For deeds of destruction some hundreds are ripe,</L>
<L>But the worst of my foes are your lads of the type:</L>

<L>They are striving to make me as poor as themselves.</L>

<L>I pack'd up my awls with a view to depart,</L>

<LG>
<L>And hence you infer (I am sure without reason)</L>
<L>That a right you possess to entangle my weazon&mdash;</L>
<L>Yet your barns I ne'er burnt, nor your blood have I spilt,</L>
<L>And my <HI>terror</HI> alone was no proof of my guilt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The charge may be true&mdash;for I found it in vain</L>
<L>To lean on a staff that was broken in twain,</L>
<L>And ere I had gone at Port Roseway to fix,</L>
<L>I had chose to sell drams on the margin of Styx.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I confess, that, with shame and contrition opprest,</L>
<L>I sign'd an agreement to go with the rest,</L>

<L>I hope, while I live, you will all think it best,</L>

<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>BY the side of the sea, in a cottage obscure,</L>
<L>There liv'd an old fellow nam'd Charlot Boncoeur,</L>
<L>Who was free to his neighbour and good to the poor,</L>
<L>Catching fish was his trade,</L>
<L>And all people said,</L>
<L>That mischief to nothing but fish he design'd,</L>
<L>To all <HI>people</HI> else he was candid and kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>One day as he went to the brink of the lake,</L>
<L>Persuading the fishes their dinner to take,</L>
<L>(The last he intended they ever should make)</L>
<L>While his hooks he employ'd to their sorrow and woe,</L>
<L>A grunting he heard in the waters below,</L>
<L>And casting his eye to the bottom (for here</L>
<L>We'll suppose that the water was perfectly clear)</L>
<L>He saw on the bed of the liquid profound</L>
<L>An unfortunate wight who was drowning, or drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>That the man to the surface once more might ascend,</L>
<L>He took up his pole, with a hook at the end,</L>
<L>And to it he fell,</L>
<L>And manag'd so well,</L>
<L>That soon to the margin the carcase was drawn,</L>
<L>And who should it be but his old neighbour John!</L>
<L><PB N="361" REF="019658_0367_0FAEE0DA0F406B40">Now, some how or other, it popp'd in his head,</L>
<L>That in spite of his drowning the man was not dead,</L>
<L>And while he was thinking what means to devise</L>
<L>That his friend might recover and open his eyes,</L>
<L>He saw, with vexation and sorrow, no doubt,</L>
<L>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in lugging him up he had put one eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;</L>
<L>However, convinc'd, from what he had heard,</L>
<L>That John might be living for aught that appear'd;</L>
<L>To his cottage he took him, and there had him bled,</L>
<L>Rubb'd, roll'd on a barrel, and then put to bed.</L>
<L>So in less than a week (to his praise be it said)</L>
<L>In less than a week the man was as found</L>
<L>(Excepting the loss of his eye, and the wound)</L>
<L>As if in his life he had never been drown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">

<L>But when John had begun to travel about,</L>
<L>He was sadly chagrin'd that his eye was put ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</L>
<L>And forgetting what service his neighbour had done him,</L>
<L>Went off to a lawyer, and clapt a writ on him,</L>
<L>Talk'd much of the value of what he had lost,</L>
<L>That Charlot must pay all the damage and cost,</L>
<L>And if with such sentence he would not comply,</L>
<L>He swore he would have his identical eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>That Charlot was vex'd, we hardly need say,</L>
<L>Yet he urg'd what he could in a moderate way,</L>
<L>Declar'd to the judges, by way of defence,</L>
<L>"That the action was wrought without malice propense,</L>
<L>That his conscience excus'd him for what he had done,</L>
<L>That fortune was only to blame&mdash;and that John</L>
<L>Might have thought himself happy (when death was so nigh)</L>
<L>To purchase his life with the loss of an eye&mdash;</L>
<L><PB N="362" REF="019658_0368_0FAEE0DAD1C61068">That the loss of an eye was a serious affair</L>
<L>Was certain&mdash;and yet he'd be bold to declare,</L>
<L>That the man who can shew but one eye in his head,</L>
<L>Is better by far than a man that is dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>7.</HEAD>
<L>In answer to all the defendant's fine pleading,</L>
<L>John said, "He had never yet found in his reading</L>
<L>A people, or nation, or senator sage,</L>
<L>Or a law, or a custom in whatever age,</L>
<L>Permitting (unpunish'd) by force or surprize</L>
<L>One neighbour to put out his next neighbour's eyes."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>8.</HEAD>
<L>The lawyers and judges were all at a stand</L>
<L>Which way to conclude on the matter in hand.</L>
<L>'Till a half-witted fellow, who chanc'd to be there,</L>
<L>Undertook to decide on this weighty affair,</L>
<L>And cry'd, "Can you doubt in a case that's so plain</L>
<L>Be guided by me, and you'll ne'er doubt again:</L>
<L>The plea of the plaintiff rests wholly on this;</L>
<L>In fishing him up he takes it amiss,</L>
<L>That Charlot manoeuvred with so little skill,</L>
<L>So aukwardly fumbled and manag'd so ill</L>
<L>As thus with his bungling to ruin John's look,</L>
<L>And put out an eye with the point of his hook&mdash;</L>
<L>Well, now, my lord judges, attend my decree,</L>
<L>Straitway let the plaintiff be thrown in the sea,</L>
<L>And after reposing a while on the bottom,</L>
<L>If he get out alone from where Charlot got him,</L>
<L>Safe, sound, and undamag'd&mdash;why, then 'tis my sentence</L>
<L>That Charlot be punish'd and brought to repentance;</L>
<L>But if, after gasping and flouncing about,</L>
<L>He drowns in the water, and never gets out,</L>
<L><PB N="363" REF="019658_0369_0FAEE0DB8EBC6A48">Why, then, it is justice, it must be confest,</L>
<L>That Charlot forthwith be discharg'd from arrest,</L>
<L>Absolv'd from all punishment due to the wound,</L>
<L>And paid in the bargain, 'cause John was not drown'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>9.</HEAD>
<L>The audience were struck with a world of surprize,</L>
<L>To find that a fool could give counsel so wise.</L>
<L>The judges themselves the sentence espous'd,</L>
<L>And freely consented that John should be sous'd.&mdash;</L>
<L>JOHN finding that matters had took a wrong turn,</L>
<L>Nor waiting to see if the court would adjourn,</L>
<L>Sneak'd out of the house, with a hiss of disgrace,</L>
<L>In dread, left the sentence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ould quickly take place&mdash;</L>
<L>Grown pliant at last, his cause he withdrew&mdash;</L>

<L>And a house for the shepherd, the shade of the oak.</L>

<L>If sometimes the papers were trifling and flat,</L>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</HEAD>
<L>THE American world, as our histories say,</L>
<L>Secluded from Europe long centuries lay,</L>
<L>But peopled by beings whom white men detest,</L>
<L>The sons of the Tartars that came from the west.</L>
<L>These Indians, 'tis certain, were here long before ye all,</L>
<L>And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;</L>
<L>In a mere state of nature, untutor'd, untaught,</L>
<L>They did as they pleas'd, and they spoke as they thought&mdash;</L>
<L>No priests they had then for the <HI>cure</HI> of their souls,</L>
<L>No lawyers, recorders, nor keepers of rolls;</L>
<L>No learned physicians vile <HI>nostrums</HI> conceal'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Their druggist was nature&mdash;her shop was the field.</L>
<L>In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</L>
<L>In the skin of a bear or a buffalo drest!</L>
<L>No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</L>
<L>But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.</L>
<L>Some bow'd to the moon, and some worshipp'd the sun,</L>
<L>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</L>
<L>In a cabin they met on their councils of state,</L>
<L>Where <HI>age</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> alone might debate:</L>
<L>With quibbles they never essay'd to beguile,</L>
<L>And nature had taught them the orator's stile;</L>
<L>No pomp they affected, nor quaintly refin'd</L>
<L>The nervous idea that glanc'd on the mind.</L>
<L><PB N="399" REF="019658_0405_0FAC9BE8E0CF3F08">When hunting or battle invited to arms,</L>
<L>The women they left to take care of their farms&mdash;</L>

<L>If death came among them his dues to demand,</L>
<L>They still had some prospect of comfort at hand&mdash;</L>
<L>The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</L>
<L>With his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.</L>
<L>THUS happy they dwelt in a rural domain,</L>
<L>Uninstructed in commerce, unpractis'd in gain,</L>
<L>Till, taught by the loadstone to traverse the seas,</L>
<L>Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</L>
<L>From records authentic, the date we can shew,</L>
<L>One thousand four hundred and ninety and two</L>
<L>Years, borne by the seasons, had vanish'd away,</L>
<L>Since the <HI>babe</HI> in the manger at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> lay.</L>
<L>What an aera was this, above all that had pass'd,</L>

<L>A new world, in value exceeding the old,</L>
<L>Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</L>
<L>Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well plann'd</L>
<L>Were scarcely sufficient to find the main land;</L>
<L>On the <HI>islands</HI> alone with the natives he spoke,</L>
<L>Except when he enter'd the great <HI>Oronoque:</HI></L>
<L>In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</L>
<L>Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</L>
<L>When at length the <HI>reward</HI> was no longer deny'd</L>
<L>From the top of Mount Pisgah he saw <HI>it</HI> and dy'd.</L>
<L>These islands and worlds in the wat'ry expanse,</L>
<L>Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</L>
<L>Since, steering for Asia, Columbus, they say,</L>
<L>Was astonish'd to find such a world in his way!</L>

<L>Who all brought their colonies over the seas.</L>
<L>These, left in a wilderness teeming with woes,</L>

<L><PB N="405" REF="019658_0411_0FAC9BED613F8D08">AH, pity the wretches that liv'd in those <HI>days,</HI></L>
<L>(Ye modern admirers of novels and plays)</L>
<L><HI>When</HI> nothing was suffer'd but mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, dull rules,</L>
<L>And nonsense from <HI>Mather,</HI> and stuff from the schools!</L>
<L>No story, like <HI>Rachel's,</HI> could tempt them to sigh,</L>
<L><HI>Susanna</HI> and <HI>Judith</HI> employ'd the bright eye&mdash;</L>
<L>No fine spun adventures tormented the breast,</L>
<L>Like our modern Clarissa, Tom Jones, and the rest.</L>
<L>Those tyrants had chosen the books for your shelves,</L>
<L>(And, trust me, no other than suited themselves,</L>
<L>For always by <HI>this</HI> may a bigot be known,</L>
<L>He speaks well of nothing but what is his own.)</L>
<L>From <HI>indwelling evil</HI> these souls to release,</L>
<L>The Quakers arriv'd with their kingdom of peace&mdash;</L>
<L>But some were transported and some bore the lash,</L>
<L>And <HI>four</HI> they hang'd fairly for preaching up trash.</L>
<L>The lands of New England (of which we now treat)</L>
<L>Were famous, ere that, for producing of wheat;</L>
<L>But the soil (or tradition says strangely amiss)</L>
<L>Has been pester'd with <HI>pumpkins</HI> from that day to this.</L>
<L>THUS, feuds and vexations distracted their reign&punc;</L>
<L>(And perhaps a few vestiges still may remain)</L>
<L>But time has presented an offspring as bold,</L>
<L>Less free to believe, and more wise than the old.</L>
<L>Their phantoms, their wizzards, their witches are fled&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>Matthew Paris's</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Neal's history of New England.</NOTE> story with horror is read&mdash;</L>
<L>His daughters, and all the enchantments they bore&mdash;</L>
<L>And the demon, that pinch'd them, is heard of no more.</L>
<L>Their taste for the fine arts is strangely increas'd,</L>
<L>And Latin's no longer a mark of the <HI>Beast:</HI></L>
<L>Mathematics, at present, a farmer may know,</L>

<L>Proud, rough, INDEPEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ENT, undaunted and free,</L>
<L>And patient of hardships, their task is the sea,</L>
<L>Their country too barren their <HI>wish</HI> to attain,</L>
<L>They make up the loss by exploring the main.</L>
<L>Wherever bright Phoebus awakens the gales,</L>
<L>I see the bold YANKEES expanding their sails,</L>
<L>Throughout the wide ocean pursuing their schemes,</L>
<L>And chasing the whales on its uttermost streams.</L>
<L>No climate, for them, is too cold or too warm,</L>
<L>They reef the broad canvas, and fight with the storm;</L>
<L>In war with the foremost their standards display,</L>
<L>Or glut the loud cannon with death, for the fray.</L>
<L>No valour in fable their valour exceeds,</L>
<L>Their spirits are fitted for desperate deeds;</L>
<L>No rivals have they in <HI>our</HI> annals of fame,</L>
<L>Or if they are rivall'd, 'tis YORK has the claim.</L>
<L>INSPIR'D at the sound, while the <HI>name</HI> she repeats,</L>
<L>Bold Fancy conveys me to Hudson's retreats&mdash;</L>
<L>Ah, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams</L>
<L>In the groves, and the forests that skirted his streams!</L>
<L>How often, with rapture, those streams were survey'd</L>
<L>When, sick of the city, I flew to the shade&mdash;</L>
<L>How often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn</L>
<L>Ere those groves shall revive, and those shades shall return!</L>
<L>Not a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!</L>
<L>And ramparts are rais'd where the cottage was found!</L>
<L>The plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,</L>
<L>With graves in abundance, and bones of the dead.</L>
<L>The first that attempted to enter this <HI>streight</HI></L>
<L>(In <HI>anno</HI> one thousand, six hundred, and eight)</L>
<L>Was HUDSON (the same that we mention'd before,</L>
<L><PB N="407" REF="019658_0413_0FAC9BEEE0E13898">Who was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.)</L>
<L>For a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)</L>
<L>This captain transferr'd all his right to the Dutch;</L>
<L>For the <HI>time</HI> has been here, to the world be it known,</L>
<L>When all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.</L>
<L>The Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,</L>
<L>And fix'd on an <HI>island</HI> to lay out a town;</L>
<L>They modell'd their streets from the horns of a ram,</L>
<L>And the name that best pleas'd them was, <HI>New Amsterdam.</HI></L>
<L>They purchas'd large tracts from the Indians for beads,</L>
<L>And sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,</L>
<L>Who, none knows for what, from their country had flown</L>
<L>To live here in peace, undisturb'd and alone.</L>
<L>NEW BELGIA, the Dutch call'd their province, be sure,</L>
<L>But names never yet made possession secure,</L>
<L>For <HI>Charly</HI> (the second that honour'd the name)</L>
<L>Sent over a squadron, asserting his claim.</L>
<L>(Had his <HI>sword</HI> and his <HI>title</HI> been equally slender,</L>
<L>In vain had they summon'd Mynheer to surrender)</L>
<L>The soil they demanded, or threaten'd their worst,</L>
<L>Insisting that <HI>Cabot had look'd at it first.</HI></L>
<L>The want of a squadron to fall on their rear</L>
<L>Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer&mdash;</L>
<L>Force ended the contest&mdash;the right was a sham,</L>
<L>And the Dutch were sent packing to hot SURINAM.</L>
<L>'Twas hard to be thus of their labours depriv'd,</L>
<L>But the age of republics had not yet arriv'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Fate saw&mdash;tho' no wizzard could tell them as much&mdash;</L>
<L>That the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.</L>
