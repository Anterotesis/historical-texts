<HEAD>AN ELEGY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>MALICE</HI> be dumb! now sheath thy pointless sting,</L>
<L>Let sick'ning <HI>Envy</HI> dart her shafts no more,</L>
<L>Let foul <HI>Detraction</HI> drop her <HI>Ebon</HI> wing,</L>
<L>And spew her poison on th' infernal shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But come heav'n's radiant <HI>Offspring!</HI> hither throng,</L>
<L>Behold your Prophet, your <HI>Elijah</HI> fled;</L>
<L>Let deep distress now palsy ev'ry tongue,</L>
<L>WHITEFIELD the <HI>Gabriel</HI> of mankind&mdash;is dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where are his dulcet periods? Where the grace?</L>
<L>The soft persuasive magic of his voice?</L>
<L>That heav'nly harp which rung immortal lays,</L>
<L>And limn'd religion to the sinners choice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where is the vollied thunder of his zeal?</L>
<L>The solemn pathos of the wrestler's prayer?</L>
<L>That held fierce conflict with the pow'rs of hell,</L>
<L>And thinn'd the dreary regions of despair.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="4" REF="011600_0004_0F8779821CFF5318">
<L>The ice of Death has quench'd the seraph's flame;</L>
<L>Mute is the tongue, that charm'd the world before:</L>
<L>The <HI>Grave'</HI>s strong fetters bind his precious frame,</L>
<L>He speaks, he pleads, he prays, he weeps&mdash;no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He sprung at once, and flung corruption by,</L>
<L>Forsook the warfare, but to catch the prize:</L>
<L>Full on the crown he held his steady eye,</L>
<L>And storm'd the golden portals of the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest visitant! we scarce forgive thy speed,</L>
<L>Scourg'd by surprize, we murmur at the rod,</L>
<L>And rebel fondness fain would interceed,</L>
<L>To tear thee from the bosom of thy God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While smiling Angels thine arrival greet,</L>
<L>And plausive Cherubs shout thy title fair:</L>
<L>A world in tears shall reach thy glad retreat,</L>
<L>And snatch one pang, from endless raptures there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive the tempest, should our sorrows rave,</L>
<L>While o'er thy mould'ring dust our heads decline;</L>
<L>We wish to glut the av'rice of the grave,</L>
<L>Bid us to die,&mdash;'tis harder to resign.</L>

<L>Who rear'd yon hallow'd PILE on <HI>Georgia'</HI>s strand,</L>
<L>And led fair Science to the savage soil?</L>
<L>Sacred to GOD, the monument shall stand,</L>
<L>And tutor'd <HI>Orphans</HI> bless the builder's toil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who compass'd oceans, travers'd every shore,</L>
<L>The busy herald of his SAVIOUR'S love?</L>
<L>Heav'n's swiftest envoy scarce could labour more</L>
<L>Or raise such levies, to the choirs above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who brav'd the tempest, try'd the various clime,</L>
<L>Encounter'd dangers, and embrac'd distress?</L>
<L>To point our view beyond the wreck of time,</L>
<L>And in that prospect, to instruct, and bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who rais'd the humble, startled the secure?</L>
<L>And shook proud rebels, from their gilded car?</L>
<L>To plaintive <HI>Lazars</HI> shed the balm of cure,</L>
<L>And with bold sceptics wag'd successful war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who heir'd from God, sagacity divine,</L>
<L>To pierce the human heart's remotest cell;</L>
<L>To drag each fell usurper from his shrine,</L>
<L>And lash reluctant demons into hell.</L>

<L>Who cinctur'd virtue, in unsullied white,</L>
<L>Emboss'd with stars, and smiling heav'nly fair?</L>
<L>Who vice pourtray'd, so baneful to the sight,</L>
<L>The monster shudder'd at her image there?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such WHITEFIELD is thy praise: while here you sleep,</L>
<L>And deck this shore with consecrated dust;</L>
<L>O'er thy cold urn shall widow'd virtue weep,</L>
<L>While pensive Angels guard the darling trust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O thou, our Father! Pastor! Guide! and Friend!</L>
<L>What richer benison could'st thou bestow?</L>
<L>In prayer for us thy dying heart to rend,</L>
<L>And fall&mdash;still struggling to redeem from woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such heav'n survey'd thee with paternal care,</L>
<L>Swift was the summons, and with joy obey'd;</L>
<L>Immortal pleasures woo'd thy presence there,</L>
<L>And everlasting love sustain'd thy head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest Saint! forever will we claim the tye,</L>
<L>For pious friendship, tho' ally'd to clay,</L>
<L>Is own'd by God, a tenant of the sky,</L>
<L>To blaze and brighten, through eternal day.</L>

<L>"<HI>LORD! may we love thee, like thy Servant here.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! ALBION groans, his poor deserted <HI>Flock,</HI></L>
<L>When will the blessed wand'rer cease to roam?</L>
<L>How could our bosoms bear the dreadful shock,</L>
<L>Should his dear JESUS take our Master home?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er the broad margin of the western deep,</L>
<L>Methinks they beckon their departed Sire;</L>
<L>With fond impatience wait, and gaze and weep,</L>
<L>Till sad and faint, reluctant they retire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! your Shepherd, will no more return,</L>
<L>The weeping stranger generous aid supplies;</L>
<L>Around his dying pillow, strangers mourn,</L>
<L>With tears fast-falling, strangers seal his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Along these coasts his reliques shall be sought,</L>
<L>Some grateful hand a Monument shall raise:</L>
<L>Some British bard in elegance of thought,</L>
<L>On sculptur'd marble shall record his praise.</L>
