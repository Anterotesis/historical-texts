<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Psal. xii. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Help,</HI> LORD! <HI>For the Godly Man ceaseth, for the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THO' the <HI>Title</HI> of the Psalm informs us, it was compos'd by <HI>David;</HI> yet we must conclude, he indited it for the Use of the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in their religious Congregations, and with a special View to their particular Circumstance at the Season of Writing.</P>
<P>But how abruptly does the Psalm begin! <HI>Help,</HI> LORD <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It seems as if they were just surprized with the afflicting News of the <HI>Death</HI> of some eminently pious, publick and useful Person, of great and happy Sway and Influence among that People, to preserve their civil and religious Interests, and countenance the Pious; upon which their Safety and Wel|fare in a great Measure under GOD depended: Inasmuch as the Text alledges <HI>This</HI> as the first moving Cause of their Cry to the LORD for Help,&mdash;not <HI>for godly Men cease,</HI> tho' this was also true, but <HI>The godly</HI> MAN <HI>ceaseth;</HI> pointing at some particular <HI>eminent Man,</HI> on whom the Pious of <HI>Israel</HI> had much of their Eye: And 'tis likely <HI>This</HI> was that great,
<PB N="6" REF="005855_0005_102700ECCDB80620">
that pious, and that publick Blessing, <HI>Samuel,</HI> who had so happily presided in their State Assemblies.</P>
<P>But tho' this particular and most grievous Loss was the Event that firstly and most deeply affected them; yet upon this great Bereavement they could not but also think of the lamentable Case of the <HI>Land,</HI> if not of the whole <HI>Earth</HI> in General, in the <HI>Failing</HI> of <HI>the Faithful from among the Children of Men;</HI> or of <HI>Adam,</HI> as the Word is in the original Hebrew.</P>
<P>And in these extensive and affecting Views, and the lively Sense that none but GOD could help them; they lift up their Hearts, their Eyes, and earnest Voices to him.</P>
<P>In the Words are therefore these two Parts,</P>
<P N="1">1. An earnest Cry to the LORD for Help&mdash;<HI>Help,</HI> LORD!</P>
<P N="2">2. The deep affecting Motives urging&mdash;<HI>For the Godly Man ceaseth, for the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. An earnest Cry to the LORD for Help. And as this was no doubt implored, not only for himself the Writer, but also for the Godly in General who lived in those Times; so their Distress is here passionately express'd, in that they cry out for Help as those who are ready to sink and perish. <NOTE N="(a j)" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Jackson.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. The deep affecting Motives urging; <HI>For the Godly Man ceaseth, for the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI> As the Reason or Motive of this earnest Cry, they not only alledge the Ceasing of some eminently pious Man, but even the growing Corruption of the Time; that the Godly and Faithful, especially of Power and Influence, failed among them: For this set forth their Danger to be great; as there were so few from whom any Help could then be expected, there were so many in every Place who would be ready to betray and wrong them, and it might well be feared that in such a spreading Depravation, even the remaining Pious might be also corrupted, <NOTE N="(a j)" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Jackson.</HI></NOTE> or cow'd down with Fear and influenc'd to temporize.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005855_0006_102700F59B2A8378">
But as a judicious Commentator observes, This may be also accommodated to all other Times, and especially this latter Age of the World: <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Moller.</HI></NOTE> i. e. 'till the surprizing Scenes of the new Heaven and Earth shall open, the ANCIENT <HI>of Days shall come&mdash;And the Kingdom and Dominion and the Great|ness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven shall be given to the People of the Saints of the</HI> MOST HIGH; <HI>whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions shall serve and obey him, </HI> Dan. vii. 21,&mdash;27.</P>
<P>Even from the Days of <HI>David,</HI> until that happy Season arrives, the Pious of every Nation and Country on Earth, have frequent Occasion to make this sorrowful, anxious and earnest Cry to GOD.</P>
<P>And we must also observe, that as this Cry was made by the truly pious, the renewed and sanctified <HI>David,</HI> in behalf of Himself and of all the Pious around him, who were deeply affected with the Ceasing of the Godly and Faithful among them; this is therefore an <HI>holy</HI> Prayer, the Motives <HI>holy,</HI> and the Cry is made in the Exercise of <HI>Piety,</HI> of holy Sorrow, Faith and other Graces: And is here set forth as a lively <HI>In|stance</HI> of the like pious Affections and Cries to GOD, in all the truly renew'd and sanctified on the like Occasions.</P>
<P>And hence we may therefore raise the following <HI>Doctrine,</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>when the Godly and Faithful cease or fail, the remain|ing Pious will be deeply affected and earnestly cry to the</HI> LORD <HI>for Help.</HI></P>
<P>To illustrate this we may consider briefly these <HI>four</HI> gene|ral Heads,</P>
<P N="1">1. Who are the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> here alluded to.</P>
<P N="2">2. In what Respect may they be said to <HI>cease</HI> or <HI>fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. On what Accounts will the remaining <HI>Pious</HI> be <HI>deeply affected</HI> on those Occasions.</P>
<P N="4">4, and lastly, What <HI>Help</HI> is This they will then so ear|nestly <HI>cry for</HI> to the LORD.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005855_0007_102700F741475CBO">
I. Who are the <HI>Godly and Faithful</HI> here alluded to.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Godly and Faithful,</HI> in the Scripture Sense, are the very same Sort of Persons: For the truly <HI>Godly</HI> will be <HI>Faithful,</HI> as we may show hereafter; and they are here con|sidered only in different Views, or in different Parts of their lovely and united Character.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. For the <HI>Godly</HI> Part of their Character.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Word in the original Hebrew is comprehensive of various Senses. Some translate it <HI>here</HI>&mdash;the Sanctified, Saint or Holy <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sept. AEthiop. Vulg.

<P><PB N="9" REF="005855_0003_102700FE809F5128">
So comprehensive is this Word in the Original. And in|deed, true <HI>Piety</HI> comprises in it all the other Senses. It com|prehends the universal Grace of LOVE both to GOD and <HI>Men;</HI> both in the inward Principle, or habitual, powerful and prevailing Bent, in its lively and continual Exercise, and in all its genuine outward Operations.</P>
<P>And here we may briefly show <HI>how any come to have this</HI> excellent and comprehensive <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>how it operates</HI> in their Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aristotelian</HI> and <HI>other Heathen Philosophers,</HI> ignorant of divine Revelation, had no Apprehension of any Grace infus'd or wrought within us by the <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> of GOD. They had Ideas indeed of various <HI>moral Virtues;</HI> such as Justice, Wisdom, Fortitude, Temperance, Kindness, a publick Spi|rit, &amp;c. And they had no Notion of our acquiring them, but by our own Power alone, and by these two Means (1) By the Consideration of the Usefulness, Honour, Excel|lence and Pleasure of any Virtue, in order to induce us to come into the Practice: And (2) By many repeated Acts obtaining by Degrees a Habit or habitual Disposition to them, and thereby rendring the Practice more agreable to us. Un|der the Head of <HI>Justice,</HI> they comprized our Duty both to GOD and <HI>Man.</HI> And according to this Way of acquiring <HI>Virtues,</HI> we might have <HI>one</HI> and <HI>not another,</HI> and have no need of a Divine Power to produce them in us.</P>
<P>And 'tis greatly to be lamented even with Tears of Blood, that by introducing <HI>this Heathenish Morality</HI> into the <HI>Christian System,</HI> our Divine Religion is exceedingly corrupted from its ancient Purity, and made to look like another Gospel than what the SON <HI>of</HI> GOD and his inspir'd <HI>Aposiles</HI> have revealed in <HI>Scripture.</HI> For a <HI>Morality</HI> underlv'd from the mediatorial Purchase, Intercession, Headship and SPIRIT OF CHRIST; without the Sanctification of the Heart by the Agency of the HOLY GHOST, and his continual Influence on the sanctified Heart, and on the Graces he has there in infused; is but a <HI>Pagan Morality.</HI> And this is that <HI>Philosophy, not</HI> the <HI>natural</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet the <HI>natural</HI> Philosophy of the <HI>Heathen</HI> also, was <HI>vain Deceit;</HI> as it taught innumerable Powers and Virtues inhaerent in all Kinds of Creatures independent on the causative Power and continual Influence of GOD: Which is utterly contrary to the real System of Nature, as revealed in Scripture, and as of late more and more appears with a growing and surprizing Lustre to the most sagacious Inquirers into Nature.</NOTE>
<PB N="10" REF="005855_0008_10270104735167C8">
but the <HI>moral</HI> Philosophy, which the Apostle calls a <HI>vain De|ceit,</HI> and so especially Cautions against in Col. ii. 6&mdash;13. <HI>As ye have therefore received</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>the</HI> LORD, <HI>so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him&mdash;Beware least any Man Spoil you through Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after</HI> CHRIST: <HI>For in him dwelleth all the Fulness of the God|head,&mdash;and ye are compleat in him,&mdash;and you being dead in your Sins&mdash;hath be quickned,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For if we lay aside all our praeconceived Notions insensibly derived from <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>other Heathen Moralists,</HI> and with|out any Prejudice examine seriously and purely the <HI>Scripture Revelation;</HI> we shall quickly see, it plainly tells us&mdash;That by our Sin and Fall in <HI>Adam</HI> we have lost all real inhaerent Holi|ness, all Title to it, and all Power, as of Ourselves, to gain it, or to gain any Right to have the Power of GOD exerted to produce it in us. That the SON <HI>of</HI> GOD in humane Na|ture, called by the Name of CHRIST, has by his deep A|basement, bitter sufferings and absolute Obedience, purcha|sed this Grace for Sinners; with the Right to give it by the HOLY SPIRIT, of employing this DIVINE AGENT to pro|duce and keep, excite, advance and compleat it in them, with all the suitable and appointed Means of conveying it to them. That the inspired <HI>Scriptures,</HI> with Teaching, Read|ing, Hearing and Thinking on, the Truths contained in them, with Prayer to GOD in CHRIST the <HI>Mediator,</HI> are the prin|cipal appointed Means: And as our exalted SAVIOUR is the Ruler of the World, he sends the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> of their Truths wherever he pleases, and brings whom he pleases to attend upon them and know them. That in these ap|pointed Means He as He pleases also employs the DIVINE SPIRIT, to enlighten, awaken, brake and humble the Hearts of Men, with the lively Views of their Sin and Sinfulness, Misery, Impotence and Danger; and with the lively Views of the infinite Grace of GOD in CHRIST, excite their hum|ble
<PB N="11" REF="005855_0009_10270106642196E08">
and earnest Applications to him. That in this Way He conveys this <HI>Holiness</HI> into the Heart of the humbled and sup|plicant Sinner. That in this Conveying of Holiness, he be|gins their <HI>Sanctification;</HI> i. e. he begins to make them Holy, he <HI>Renews</HI> their Hearts, he is said to <HI>create them anew</HI> and make them <HI>new Creatures:</HI> And this is called their <HI>Regenera|tion</HI> or<HI>Renovation.</HI> That this Holiness in them is a universal, powerful and active <HI>Bent</HI> of conforming to the holy Nature and Will of GOD. That this powerful and active Bent is therefore fuly called by the Name of <HI>Life;</HI> and those who have it are said to be <HI>quickened,</HI> or in Point of Holiness to be <HI>made alive.</HI> That this <HI>vital Holiness</HI> comprizes in it the Grace of holy <HI>Love</HI> to GOD and <HI>Man,</HI> with <HI>all other Graces</HI> or holy Powers and Inclinations. That the SON of GOD as <HI>Mediator,</HI> by the <HI>same Divine Agent,</HI> keeps alive these holy Bents or Graces, in those appointed Means helps to excite them into Exercise; and in their Exercise enables rightly to embrace Himself the SAVIOUR with Love and humble Trust, and in Him most heartily give up themselves intirely to GOD and serve Him.</P>
<P>And thus the <HI>Ungodly</HI> becomes a <HI>Godly Man,</HI> and begins to live a Life of Piety.</P>
<P>But <HI>how</HI> does the HOLY SPIRIT help to <HI>excite</HI> these Graces in us into <HI>Exercise,</HI> and in their Exercise <HI>enable</HI> us rightly to <HI>embrace</HI> the SAVIOUR with Love and humble Trust, and in Him most heartily <HI>give up</HI> ourselves intirely to GOD and <HI>serve</HI> Him?</P>
<P>To this I <HI>answer</HI>&mdash;In the initial Sanctification of the Heart, He gave it a <HI>new</HI> or <HI>holy Taste</HI> or <HI>Relish.</HI> He thereby disposes and enables it to relish holy Contemplations on <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Divine Objects;</HI> such as the glorious GOD and all his Excellencies as they appear in CHRIST, and all his Revelations. Having given this holy Relish in our initial Sanctification; therefrom arises an <HI>Agreeableness</HI> between <HI>our Hearts</HI> and these <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>holy Objects,</HI> the Contemplation of them becomes agreable; and thus are we prepared for his <HI>further Illuminations</HI> or <HI>Dis|coveries.</HI> And now as he pleases, He <HI>shines into our Hearts to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST; as the Apostle expresses it, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 6. Now he shows the blessed GOD in CHRIST to the holy and enlightened Soul as a most glorious, reconcileable and lovely Object. But according to and by the Scripture, he points
<PB N="12" REF="005855_0010_1027010DA205AFB0">
us out to CHRIST as the only Mediator, Reconciler and Way to the FATHER. He helps to see the Alsufficiency and Freeness of this DIVINE MEDIATOR, to reconcile us to GOD and redeem us perfectly for ever. He helps to see Him inviting us to Him for this happy Purpose. He thereby helps us to fly into his Arms, to embrace Him in all his Offi|ces, and confide intirely in Him, or rest intirely on Him to fulfill them for us.</P>
<P>By such Views of CHRIST and such Applications to Him, He opens the Way of our Access to GOD: And by our en|lightning <HI>Views</HI> of the Glory of GOD in CHRIST, as reveal'd in <HI>Scripture,</HI> he <HI>excites</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>other Graces</HI> towards Him into a lively Exercise. And in this lively View and Exercise, we <HI>actually</HI> and most highly admire, esteem, love, prefer, de|sire, chuse, embrace, adhere to, and take the highest Delight in this most glorious Object; we most earnestly desire a full and everlasting Interest in Him, Vision of Him, Communion with Him in universal and perfect Holiness; we most gladly see and humbly receive the wondrous Tender of HIMSELF to be ours in CHRIST for ever; and in the deepest Gratitude we absolutely give up ourselves and all we have eternally to Him.</P>
<P>Hereby <HI>every other Grace</HI> is also <HI>excited</HI> into a <HI>lively Exercise;</HI>&mdash;A hearty Repentance for all the known Dishonours we have done to GOD; Sorrow, Shame, Abasement and Self|Abhorrence for all our Vileness and Contrariety to Him, and for our Deficiencies; intire Submission to his fovereign Pleasure; Humility, Meekness, Patience under all his Chastizements; Gratitude for all his Kindnesses, Belief in all his Revelations, Hope in all his Promises, a supream Zeal for his Glory, and Grief for the Sins of others; a diligent Study and Labour to grow in Grace and Knowledge, and to discover and do his universal Will in all Places, Times, Relations, Circumstances; believing Views of the invisible World, and earnest Aspira|tions after, compleat Conformity to Him, and the heavenly Glory.</P>
<P>Hence also arises an <HI>actual Love</HI> to his World and Ordi|nances, Truths and Precepts, Churches, Ministers, People: And to his <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>every Part of his Image</HI> wherever we see it; whether in <HI>Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Independents, Baptists,</HI> and in every other Denomination of <HI>Christians</HI> whatever; whether high or low, rich or poor, ho|noured
<PB N="13" REF="005855_0011_10270113B39A4420">
or despised; together with <HI>every other Grace</HI> of Con|descention, Humility, Modesty, Forbearance, Gentleness, Meekness, Mercy, Kindness, &amp;c. in all our Carriage to <HI>them</HI> in particular and to <HI>others</HI> in general.</P>
<P>Yea, from hence arises our <HI>actual Love</HI> of Pity, Patience, Forgiveness, Kindness, and <HI>other Graces</HI> towards our <HI>Enemies:</HI>&mdash;Yea, a <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Benevolence</HI> towards <HI>all our Neighbours;</HI>&mdash;the Church and Congregation we are special Members of, the Parish and Town we live in, the Province, Country and Kingdom we belong to;&mdash;the Professors of CHRIST in every Nation&mdash;Yea, to <HI>all Mankind</HI> in General, both in this and future Generations&mdash;With <HI>Desires</HI> of, <HI>Prayers</HI> for, and hearty <HI>Readiness</HI> according to our several Sphaeres, Powers and Op|portunities to promote their temporal, spiritual and eternal Welfare.</P>
<P>This is the General Character of the truly <HI>Godly.</HI> We now proceed to consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Faithful</HI> Part of their Character.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Faithfulness</HI> supposes and refers to some kind of Cove|nant or Word, Profession or Engagement, either open or se|cret. And Faithfulness <HI>in Men</HI> alludes to some praevious <HI>En|gagement</HI> of theirs, either to GOD or <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of <HI>Godly Men</HI> is a Sort of a Grace, Exercise and Practice peculiar to them. It arises out of their renewed Natures: And so is likewise a Fruit of the sanctify|ing and quickning SPIRIT of GOD, and of the mediatorial Purchase and Headship of CHRIST. From the very Nature and Operation of that <HI>Piety</HI> in them as we describ'd above, we have seen how they came in the most hearty Manner to give up themselves and all they have to GOD for ever. It partly arose from their initial Sanctification, wherein their Natures were made Holy, or a powerful Bent of Piety was produced in them by the HOLY SPIRIT; partly from a live|ly View of GOD'S infinite Excellence and Loveliness as he appears in CHRIST; partly from a grateful Sense of his utterly undeserved and unbounded Kindness to them; and partly from a clear and agreable View of his absolute Propriety in them, and of their Happiness in being absolutely subject to Him.</P>
<P>And now having justly and freely <HI>recogniz'd</HI> or <HI>own'd</HI> this Right of his, and heartily <HI>given</HI> themselves and their All to
<PB N="14" REF="005855_0012_10270118335B4B08">
Him; they come under a new and <HI>further Obligation,</HI> a vo|luntary, solemn, irreversible <HI>Engagement,</HI> in Dependance on his gracious Influence assisting, to study and labour to know and do his universal Pleasure, and thereby promote his Glory: Which at the same Time will also advance, both their own Joy and Happiness, and the Joy and Happiness of Others. <HI>This additional Obligation</HI> is an <HI>additional Incentive</HI> in them, to study and labour these most righteous, holy, happy and ex|cellent Ends in View: And this <HI>Dedication</HI> of theirs to GOD is a continual <HI>Spring</HI> to their <HI>Fidelity.</HI> The Considerations of their sacred Covenant, of the Vows of GOD upon them, and their being his absolute, acknowledged Propriety, are powerful Motives to an answerable Care and Labour.</P>
<P>Nor can their <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to GOD be grievous or compul|sive to them. It is most agreable to their renewed Natures, and to the Sense of their Happiness in being absolutely resigned to Him. It is most agreable to the prevailing Bent of Piety in them, and to the holy and earnest Desires of their renewed Natures. <HI>His Laws being in their Hearts,</HI> i.e. in their holy Love and Propensities to them, it becomes <HI>their Delight to do his Will;</HI> whereby they also please and bring him Glory. And as the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD is most dear to them; they rightly apprehend and feel their promoting it to be a great and neces|sary Part of their Happiness. The more Glory they bring Him, the more happy they are: And as they are glad of every Incentive and Help to promote the Glory of GOD and their own <HI>Happiness,</HI> which are inseparably join'd together; they look with Pleasure on their <HI>Dedication</HI> to him, as not only what was <HI>his Right and Due,</HI> but also as a <HI>powerful Mo|tive</HI> to promote his Glory and their own Felicity.</P>
<P>Yea, with all the Incentives above, the truly Godly have included in their <HI>Piety</HI> and excited in their <HI>Illumination,</HI> that most powerful Grace of <HI>Faith,</HI> which is the <HI>Evidence of Things unseen;</HI> whereby with realizing Views they see <HI>invisible Things</HI> revealed in Scripture, both Present, Past and Future:&mdash;In particular&mdash;the invisible GOD, his transcendent Excellencies, his continual Presence; the Glories of Heaven, the Miseries of Hell; the Solemnity of the general Judgement, and the open Discovery of the Hearts, Tho'ts, Inclinations, Views, Designs, Words and Deeds of Men in that awful Day, with their answerable Recompence: And the <HI>realizing Views</HI> of such Things as these are also mighty <HI>Springs</HI> to their <HI>Fidelity.</HI></P>

In the Light and View of these Things, they live as under the universal Eye of GOD: They look on Themselves and all their Powers, Estates and Time, as absolutely <HI>His,</HI> to be faithfully improved for <HI>Him:</HI> And to this they are indispensi|bly bound by the most sacred <HI>Covenant,</HI> and by numberless <HI>Acknowledgements, Surrenders,</HI> and <HI>other Obligations.</HI> In the lively Sense of This, they set themselves in all Places, Times and Circumstances, in Dependence on his Help, to discover and do every Thing He would have them; that they may yield Him their due and grateful Homage, be Faithful to HIM, Beneficial to <HI>Others,</HI> and attain the happy <HI>Ends</HI> of their <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Engagements.</HI> They labour in the In|crease of Knowledge, in resisting their Temptations, in de|nying themselves, in mortifying their sinful Dispositions both of Flesh and Spirit, in the Advance of Purity and Holiness in Heart and Life, in the Exercise and Growth of all Graces, in performing all Duties, and in carrying on his spiritual Kingdom among others. And they endeavour in their se|veral Places; whether Husbands, Wives; Masters, Mis|tresses, Fathers, Mothers, Children; Brothers, Sisters, Ser|vants; Friends, Neighbours; Trustees or Correspondents; private Persons, publick Officers Civil or Ecclesiastical, to discharge the Duties of their several Relations and Engage|ments, to the Honour of GOD and Good of <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, The <HI>more Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> they are, the more they desire and labour to fill up their <HI>Time</HI> with some <HI>Duty</HI> or other, either outward or inward, and every <HI>Duty</HI> with <HI>Grace:</HI> And a great Part of their <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> is Sincerity in Word and Behaviour; Honesty and Fairness in their Deal|ings; Consideration of their Engagements and Professions, <HI>First</HI> to GOD, and <HI>under Him</HI> in all Things allowable, to <HI>Men;</HI> Impartiality and Integrity; unshaken Steadiness in the midst of all Temptations, and constant Perseverance thro' all Difficulties.</P>
<P>This is some General View of the truly <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> Man. It must be own'd indeed that every one, excepting only <HI>the Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS, has always <HI>been</HI> and is grie|viously <HI>Deficient</HI> both in the inward Exercise and outward Practice of their <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> And the more they grow in their Views of the Glorious Purity of GOD, the Per|fection of <HI>his Will,</HI> and intimate Aquaintance with them|selves; the more they see both of their Heart and Life; Defi|ciency;
<PB N="16" REF="005855_0014_10270122C50EAD80">
the more broken-hearted, humble and Self-censorious they grow; and the more, as <HI>Job</HI> in the clearer Views of GOD, <HI>abhor themselves in Dust and Ashes.</HI> But their <HI>Defi|ciences</HI> are more or less their Sorrow, Shame and Burthen. And the Sense thereof continually excites their Applications to the <HI>Blood</HI> and SPIRIT of CHRIST, to cleanse them, to increase the Purity of that Source within them whence they flow; and then excites them to the greater Care and Dili|gence after.</P>
<P>But yet in the midst of all Deficiences, how surpassing amiable are the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> in <HI>this united Character?</HI> How do they display the lovely Graces receiv'd from CHRIST and shining in them? How alluringly do they represent the far transcending Loveliness of CHRIST himself? From whom they derive these Graces, and which give them some Resem|blance of Him; who is incomparably <HI>Fairer</HI> in them <HI>than the Sons of Men,</HI> and who has them in the highest Perfection and without a Shade. What continual Blessings do these Godly and Faithful spread round about them? And how Desireable to live a <HI>long while</HI> on the Earth, which greatly needs them, if not 'till CHRIST Himself appears?</P>
<P>And yet These, alas! may <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> as well as Others, tho' in some Respects in a different Manner: Which there|fore brings us to consider</P>
<P N="2">II. In what Respect may they be said to <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> from <HI>among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Former Word</HI> applied to the <HI>Godly Man,</HI> signifies in the Neutral Sense&mdash;He <HI>Decays, consumes, finishes</HI> and <HI>ceases</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sept.

<P>But tho' these <HI>Words</HI> applied Severally to the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful,</HI> are <HI>different</HI> in the Original and other Versions as
<PB N="17" REF="005855_0015_1026DF431F8F8B48">
well as our own; yet as we view'd the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> Character as <HI>join'd together,</HI> we shall for the same Reason ap|ply <HI>these different Words</HI> with the various Idaeas suggested in them to the same Persons.</P>
<P>And here no doubt is meant their <HI>Ceasing</HI> and <HI>Failing</HI> with respect to this Lower World only. Not their ceasing or failing to be Habitually such Godly and Faithful Persons as once they were; tho' they fail in many Instances of Duty and Faithfulness, and too often decline in the Power and Vigour of their Graces: Yet their vital and federal Union to CHRIST their mediatorial Head remains; his <HI>Covenant</HI> with them is <HI>ordered in all Things well, everlasting and sure;</HI> and agreable thereto He will never fail them. HISHOLY SPIRIT always Dwells, i. e. always acts as a Sanctifies and Quickener in them, and He will never let the Seed of Grace He has planted in them, Die. But by this is meant their ceasing and failing to be Present <HI>Here,</HI> and in the <HI>Particular Places</HI> where they liv'd, appear'd and spread their Light and Influence.</P>
<P>And this may be also meant both in a <HI>Personal</HI> and <HI>Social</HI> Sense.</P>
<P N="1">1. They may be said to <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> from among the Children of Men in a <HI>Personal</HI> Sense.</P>
<P>i.e. When these individual <HI>Persons</HI> either by Death, or by removing to some other Place on the Earth, cease or fail to live and appear in the Houses, Churches, Towns and Coun|tries where they shined and diffused their Grace and Useful|ness.</P>
<P>Sometimes, yea often, we know, while they live on the Earth, they are by some Means or other <HI>removed</HI> to <HI>some other Place,</HI> and carry their gracious Influence with them. Yea, such has been often the Blindness of their unfriendly Neigh|bours to their amiable Excellence, and such their Enmity to them; as the Apostle tells us of some of these Godly and Faithful Ones before his Days, Heb. xi. 36&mdash;38. <HI>They had Trials of cruel Mockings and Scourgings, yea, moreover of Bonds and Imprisonment:</HI> [thro' Force] <HI>they wandered about in Sheep|Skins and Goat-Skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; of whom the World was not worthy: They wandered in Desarts and in Mountains, and in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</HI> So it has been in almost every Age and Country where these Godly
<PB N="18" REF="005855_0016_10270132A74EBA98">
and Faithful Men have appeared; and so it may be also even in the Land we live in.</P>
<P>However, all the Godly and Faithful must <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> even from the whole Race of Men on the Earth, by <HI>Death;</HI> excepting the very few who shall be <HI>found alive</HI> at CHRIST'S Second Coming; who <HI>shall not Die,</HI> as the Apostle tells us, but be <HI>chang'd in a Moment.</HI> And it is the <HI>Ceasing</HI> and <HI>Fail|ing</HI> of the Pious at <HI>Death,</HI> that our Text seems to have a spe|cial View to. It is a Ceasing and Failing, not only from par|ticular Houses, Churches, Towns and Countries; but <HI>from among the Children</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> on Earth; i.e. from Living a|mong them; a Ceasing and Failing, by <HI>Finishing</HI> their Lives, or <HI>Dying,</HI> and utterly disappearing among them.</P>
<P>And the Word <HI>Adam</HI> in the Original, which signifies <HI>Man as Earthy</HI> or <HI>made out of the Dust of the Earth,</HI><NOTE N="(mu)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Muis.</HI></NOTE> seems to exhibit Idaeas and Beauties lost in our Translation. For it seems plainly to point us (1) to the Original, earthy bodily Constitution of our First humane Father Adam; as also to his First mortal Sin, Guilt, Condemnation and Frailty: Yea, (2) to the like Earthy, bodily Constitution, and mortal Sin, Guilt, Condemnation and Frailty of all the Race involved in and derived from Him: Whereby both the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faith|ful</HI> are made to <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> in <HI>every Age and</HI> Place, to the Great Loss of Survivors, who are thereby righteously cha|stized.</P>
<P>Sometimes they <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> by <HI>Violent Deaths.</HI> Some|times by to us accidental Strokes of Providence. Sometimes by the barbarous Hands of Men: Some were <HI>Stoned,</HI> some <HI>Sawn asunder,</HI> some <HI>Slain with the Sword;</HI> as the Apostle observ'd in that aforesaid <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 37. And Multitudes of the most Pious and Faithful of Men have been accounted <HI>not fit to live,</HI> and in numberless Ways of Cruelty, dispatched out of the World.</P>
<P>And where there are no kind of violent Means, there are numberless mortal Causes within them and in the very Sub|stances they live on; whereby in the present <HI>Course of Na|ture,</HI> they <HI>Decay, Consume</HI> and Dye. Their bodily Sense and Life expire: Their Bodies quickly putrify, and must be hid in the Grave; where they moulder and return to the
<PB N="19" REF="005855_0017_102701344E367550">
Earthy Elements out of which they were formed. And tho' the <HI>Souls</HI> of the truly <HI>Pious,</HI> are as soon as loosed from their <HI>Bodies,</HI> made Perfect in Holiness and by Holy Angels tran|sported to the Heavenly Glory; yet as <HI>Job</HI> describes it, Chap. vii. 9, 10. <HI>As the Cloud is consumed and vanisheth away; so He that goeth down to the Grave shall come up no more, He shall re|turn no more to his House, neither shall his Place</HI> [of Appearance any where on the Earth] <HI>know Him any more.</HI></P>
<P>Yea,</P>
<P N="2">2. They may be said to <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> from among the Children of Men in a <HI>Social</HI> Sense.</P>
<P>i. e. When either by Removing or Dying, they leave but a few like them remaining; the Renewing Influence of the SPIRIT of CHRIST seems with-held from the Souls of O|thers, that Others like them in Piety and Faithfulness, appear not to rise in their Room as fast as they Dye or Remove: And so their Number <HI>Deminishes,</HI> either among the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> in General, or in the Particular Places where they sojourned.</P>
<P>Sometimes, when <HI>Particular Pious</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> Persons, are Removed by Death or Otherwise from Particular Places; there is such an Effusion of the SPIRIT of Grace on <HI>Others,</HI> that in a <HI>collective Sense,</HI> the Godly and Faithful may be so far from <HI>Failing</HI> in a Town or Country, as they may rather be said to be <HI>growing</HI> in Number and Proportion. But when He with-holds his awakening and converting Influence from a Particular People, then the Ceasing of every Pious and Faithful Person <HI>lessens</HI> the Number: And so by <HI>Ceasing</HI> one after another, 'till at length there remains but <HI>few</HI> if any, especially of Figure and Influence, to countenance the true Religion of CHRIST in its Power and Purity, and to bear it up against the overwhelming Power and Artifice of its un|wearied and crafty Enemies.</P>
<P>And when Things are come or seem to be coming to such a Pars as This; then the <HI>Ceasing</HI> of every eminent Person for Piety and Faithfulness, is an awful Blow: And then with a very affecting Emphasis will the few remaining People of Piety lament it, that <HI>the Godly Man ceaseth, and the Faithful fail among them.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> may <HI>cease</HI> and <HI>fail</HI> in one <HI>Place</HI> on the Earth, and at the same Time <HI>appear</HI> and <HI>grow</HI> in <HI>ano|ther.</HI> But when the Pious look around them, survey this
<PB N="20" REF="005855_0018_102701375F89CE88">
lower World, and see or hear of the Godly and Faithful <HI>Ceasing</HI> and <HI>Failing</HI> more or less in <HI>every Country;</HI> This will yet more deeply wound them, and the affecting View will make them more grievously to cry, that <HI>the Godly and Faith|ful cease and fail from among the</HI> Race of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings us on to the</P>
<P N="3">III. General Head, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>On what Accounts</HI> will the remain|ing Pious be then <HI>deeply affected.</HI></P>
<P>To this I have now only Time to observe in the General; they will Then be deeply affected on these <HI>two</HI> Accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because they rightly judge their Ceasing and Failing to be a <HI>Great Loss in itself.</HI></P>
<P>Those surviving Relatives and Friends of theirs who have <HI>not a Spark of true Piety</HI> in them, may be affected from <HI>sensi|tive</HI> and <HI>earthly</HI> Causes or Considerations, and from the Ope|ration of <HI>meer natural</HI> Affection towards them. And the nearer their Relation is or the more they want them on worldly Accounts, and the more on these Accounts they loved them; the more deeply will they grieve at their being re|moved from them. But those of them who are <HI>truly Pious,</HI> will also mourn on other Accounts, and Accounts incompara|bly more important. For they likewise highly valued and dearly lov'd them on Account of their <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to GOD and <HI>Man:</HI> And for the Loss and Want of them on these Accounts they will be move with Increase of Sorrow.</P>
<P>Yea, on the same Accounts with <HI>others</HI> truly <HI>Pious</HI> who <HI>know them,</HI> either by Conversation, Hearing, Seeing, Corre|spondence, Writing or Information of their Piety and Faith|fulness, lament their Loss: And the more Eminent and Ser|viceable they were, the more corrupt the Times, the fewer there are remaining like them, and the more they are wanted for their Piety, Fidelity and useful Influence; the more pun|gent and afflictive will their Bereavement be to the Pious who know them.</P>
<P>Their Loss on <HI>Spiritual Accounts</HI> is <HI>chiefly Great,</HI> and the <HI>truly Pious</HI> clearly <HI>See</HI> it. There is the Loss of their gracious, amiable and exciting Examples; of their instructive, quick|ning and engaging Conversations; of their Corrections, Councils and Admonitions; of their earnest Prayers on all Occasions; of their active, faithful and beneficent Cares, Con|trivances
<PB N="21" REF="005855_0019_1027013A75CD2D98">
and Labours; and of their powerful, happy and extensive Influence.</P>
<P>On <HI>these Accounts</HI> their <HI>Ceasing</HI> is a Great Loss, not only to their Relatives and Friends, but even their Enemies. Not only to their Families and Neighbours; but also to their Churches, Towns and Countries. Not only to the Ungodly, but much more Sensibly to the Pious who survive them: Yea, to the visible Interest of CHRIST, in the Particular Places where they lived, and the Earth in General.</P>
<P>A Loss that deserves to be laid to Heart and seriously be|wail'd by <HI>All.</HI> And 'twill be very grievous to the <HI>truly Pious,</HI> not only from their Personal Affection to and Want of them for <HI>Themselves,</HI> on the best Accounts; but also from their Love to CHRIST and Concern for his spiritual Kingdom; and from their Love and Concern for <HI>his People</HI> and <HI>Others,</HI> who greatly need them.</P>
<P>Yea therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. They will be deeply affected, because they also rightly judge it a <HI>Loss</HI> of <HI>threatning Consequence.</HI></P>
<P>For therein they see the righteous Hand of GOD, his par|ticular and growing Displeasure with the <HI>Places</HI> where they fail, and the threatning Aspect their Removal has on CHRIST'S holy Kingdom in them. They have a lively View of his withdrawing his SPIRIT, i. e. his gracious Influence, toge|ther with Those in whom He dwelt and whom He takes a|way. They can't but apprehend the Weakening of the Hands, the Influence and Hearts of the remaining Pious; the Growth of rampant Enemies to the Power of Godliness; the Increase of Irreligion, and the hastning on of ruinous Judgments: As the Holy Scriptures, the History of all Ages, with the moral and natural Tendency of Things give abundant Reason to expect. And with such <HI>awful Views</HI> the Surviving Pious can|not but be deeply affected: and in the grievous Prospect lift up their Hearts and Eyes to Heaven and cry&mdash;<HI>Help,</HI> LORD! <HI>For the Godly Man ceaseth, for the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we come to our</P>
<P>IV and last General Head; which is to shew&mdash;What <HI>Help</HI> is This they will so earnestly <HI>cry for</HI> to the LORD, on such sorrowful Occasions.</P>

<P>And as the LORD, in the Original, is JEHOVAH, which signifies the only true, infinite, incomprehensible, eternal and immutable GOD; to whom should the Pious look and cry but to <HI>Him,</HI> upon such sad Occasions? They know that none but He can help and save them. With Him alone is the Rule of the World, and the boundless <HI>Residue</HI> of the Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT. And the Light and Grace within them will First excite them to look up to Him and <HI>see</HI> his Hand; yea, his holy, righteous, angry and awful Hand in these afflictive Dispensations; and then to <HI>cry</HI> for <HI>all Kinds of Help</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> for <HI>Themselves</HI> and <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>See</HI> clearly and surely the parti|cular <HI>Reasons</HI> of these Divine Corrections, and to be suitably <HI>affected</HI> with them and <HI>excited</HI> by them.</P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>Submit</HI> to the sovereign Hand and Will of GOD, to <HI>search</HI> out and <HI>discover</HI> their <HI>Sins</HI> the provoking Causes, to <HI>humble</HI> themselves before Him, <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>return</HI> to Him in CHRIST; and in Faith and Earnestness to <HI>implore</HI> his Pardon and sufficient Measures of his sanctify|ing, quickning and strengthning SPIRIT for the Time to come.</P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>Support</HI> them under his heavy Hand, to keep them from desponding, or sinking in their Spirits, and to <HI>comfort</HI> them under the Sense of their great Loss and in their awful Prospects.</P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>improve</HI> the sad Bereavements to the Acceptance and Glory of GOD, the Good of Others, and to <HI>make them turn</HI> to their spiritual and eternal Benefit.</P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>see more</HI> of the <HI>Evil of Sin</HI> in the Removal of such Godly, Faithful, useful, and desireable
<PB N="23" REF="005855_0021_1027013EF610CE18">
Persons from this lower World; to <HI>look more</HI> seriously into <HI>Eternity,</HI> and prepare to follow them.</P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>remember</HI> and <HI>imitate</HI> their lovely <HI>Examples,</HI> to <HI>observe</HI> their gracious <HI>Councils,</HI> and to <HI>seek</HI> after the <HI>Fruits</HI> of their earnest <HI>Prayers.</HI></P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>moderate</HI> their Affections to|wards every Creature here below, to <HI>place</HI> them more on CHRIST and the other Glories in the World above; and for Help to <HI>make their Calling,</HI> Title and <HI>Election</HI> to them <HI>sure.</HI></P>
<P>They will cry for Help to <HI>take off their Dependance</HI> on the most Pious, Faithful, useful and most needful Men; and bring them more to <HI>look</HI> to GOD and <HI>trust</HI> on Him in CHRIST, the unbounded Fountain of all Supplies of Power, Light and Grace; and on whom they absolutely depend for Safety in the most corrupt and dangerous Times, and for the raising up of Others to shine as Lights in the World, maintain the Cause of CHRIST and Piety, and stand by his People.</P>
<P>They will therefore earnestly cry for Help, in <HI>pouring out his</HI> SPIRIT of Light and Grace on Themselves and Others.</P>
<P>They will cry for <HI>Renewing</HI> and <HI>Converting Influence,</HI> to raise up Others in the Families, Churches, Towns and Coun|tries of the Removed, yea, in every Place of the Earth, and make them as eminent and more for Piety and Faithfulness than any who have gone before them.</P>
<P>And they will also cry for <HI>Reviving</HI> and <HI>Exciting Influence</HI> on Themselves and the remaining Pious, to <HI>greater Degrees</HI> of Light and Holiness; of Love to GOD and Man; of a Publick Spirit; and of Knowledge, Wisdom, Vigour, Zeal, Activity, Courage and steady Faithfulness in the Cause and Service of CHRIST and <HI>his People.</HI></P>
<P>And they <HI>thus earnestly cry</HI> to the LORD for Help; <HI>Because</HI> they clearly see it to be of the greatest Moment and Necessity&mdash;they know that no other can help without Him, and that all Help must derive from Him&mdash;that in Him thro' CHRIST there is Help enough to be found for Themselves and Others&mdash;that in CHRIST as <HI>Mediator,</HI> the Way is open for their free Access to HIM, and for his helping Influence to <HI>them</HI>&mdash;and lastly, that the infinite Merits, Pity &amp; Intercession of CHRIST; the infinite Grace of GOD; the Scripture History, Promises and Invitations; with the Experience of Themselves and O|thers, and their Covenant-Interest in Him; are sufficient
<PB N="24" REF="005855_0022_1027014217BA62F8">
Grounds of Encouragement, to cry in Hope of Succeeding, for every needed Instance of his helping Power and Mercy.</P>
<P>And this for <HI>Illustration</HI>&mdash;we now come to IMPROVE the Things delivered.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P>Hence we may learn how <HI>distinguishingly amiable</HI> are the Godly and Faithful, and how <HI>worthy</HI> of the <HI>highest Esteem</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of all who know them.</P>
<P>Hence we may likewise see the <HI>exceeding Evil</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> with the awful <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD in their <HI>Ceasing</HI> and <HI>Fail|ing</HI> from among the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> in this World below.</P>
<P>Then, as we should highly Prize them while they live, we should <HI>earnestly Pray</HI> for their <HI>Continuance</HI> Here as long as they can be useful.</P>
<P>Then surely the <HI>Psalmist</HI> acted the Part of the <HI>wisest</HI> Man, when He set <HI>his Eyes on</HI> the <HI>Pious and Faithful of the Land, that they might dwell with Him and serve Him,</HI> Psal. c. 6. And they are the <HI>wisest Rulers</HI> and the <HI>wisest People,</HI> who chuse the <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> into <HI>Places</HI> of <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Movement.</HI></P>
<P>Then our <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Slighting</HI> of such, and much more our <HI>Enmity</HI> to them, is most vile and foolish, and argues the deep Depravity of Humane Nature.</P>
<P>Here is then also a <HI>Trial</HI> both of the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Degree</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> within us, by our pious <HI>Concern</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI> upon their <HI>Failing</HI> or <HI>Ceasing</HI> among us.</P>
<P>And hence we may also see the <HI>awful Frowns</HI> of GOD upon THIS TOWN and LAND in the <HI>Ceasing</HI> and <HI>Failing</HI> of such; what abundant Reason we have to be <HI>deeply affected</HI> therewith, and <HI>earnestly cry</HI> to the LORD for <HI>Help.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings us to the sorrowful Consideration of the unspeakable Loss which not only this Church and Congrega|tion, but <HI>this Town</HI> and <HI>Prevince</HI> have met with, in the De|cease of that eminently Faithful, great, powerful and steady Friend to Piety, Liberty and his Country; the truly Ho|nourable and dear Mr. CUSHING, even in the very Height of his Influence and Usefulness among us.</P>
<P>It has been a great Honour and Happiness to this <HI>Metro|polis,</HI> that He was Born, brought up, and has lived in it; and been universally esteemed, loved and honoured by it</P>
<P>But as I had lived about <HI>Sixty</HI> Miles off, and He entered the <HI>College</HI> the same Time I left it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in <HI>July</HI> 1707,
<PB N="25" REF="005855_0023_10270143E0514120">
within Two Years after which I went abroad, and returned not 'till 1717, and then He belong'd to another Society; I scarce knew any Thing of Him 'till 1724, when he was a|bout 30 Years old, married one of our Church, began to at|tend the Publick Worship with us, invited me to his House, told me He should be glad of being acquainted with me: And as He then came and lived but 3 or 4 Doors of me, and I found his Sentiments very agreable to my Way of Thinking; I fell into a special Acquaintance with Him, and found it highly worth the enjoying.</P>
<P>I found with Surprize and Pleasure, that in a small, relax'd and feeble <HI>Body,</HI> there dwelt a great, a lively, a strong and well composed <HI>Soul:</HI> The View of which has often led me into close Enquiries into the Nature and Reasons of this myste|rious Case, which is not so proper for a Pulpit-Consideration: That He was a Man of excellent acquired Gifts as well as na|tural, intellectual Abilities; of a cool and clear Head; of a penetrating Mind; of a very extensive, calm, impartial &amp; acute Way of Thinking; well acquainted with the Affairs of the World, with Men and Things, with our civil and eccesiasti|cal Constitution, with Humane Nature and Divinity; almost always ready to collect the Idaeas fix'd in his Mind, and ex|press his Sentiments with such Propriety, Clearness, Consistency and Justness, as to satisfy the Minds of Others: And where a Case was <HI>new</HI> and <HI>difficult,</HI> which requir'd not only collecting of fix'd Idaeas, but a new Train of Thinking and Inference; there he would a little deliberate, but quickly give a clear and upright Judgement.</P>
<P>My Acquaintance began with the <HI>Table-</HI>Conversation. And There I never saw or heard any Thing in Him light or tri|fling, taunting or jeering, indecent or offensive to any Present, nor reviling others Absent; but all was calm, pleasant, natu|ral and useful. If any Thing happened to fall from any of a censorious Tendency; He would immediately check it, and lead to a <HI>charitable</HI> and <HI>fair</HI> Construction of Persons, Words, and Actions. Our Entertainments were and agreable Variety of Divinity, History, civil or religious Matters, or natural Philosophy; or Observations on present Occurrences and Transactions, either in the Town or Land, or other Paris of the World; as various Subjects happen'd to occur, with a can did Freedom; his Genius inclining Him either to unbyass'd Reasoning or agreable Observations.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005855_0024_10270149D8C9EAB0">
At other Times, and especially when we were more alone. I found Him to be a Person very tho'tful, serious, <HI>Pious,</HI> of and <HI>excellent Set</HI> of <HI>Principles,</HI> both civil, moral and religious: Clearly and firmly fixed in the righteous Principles of <HI>universal Liberty;</HI> without which He rightly judged there could be no true Religion, unless it were in a State of Suffering, nor com|mon Honesty, nor Justice, nor Safety, nor good Neighbour|hood, nor manly Comfort in the World: And there was scarce any Thing more odious to Him than Tyranny and Sla|very, Persecution and Oppression of every Kind, and in every Denomination of Men and Christians.</P>
<P>Nor did I ever find a Man more <HI>free</HI> from <HI>Selfish Princi|ples,</HI> or of a more <HI>Publick Spirit.</HI> He would have all others enjoy the same Advantages both civil and religious with Him|self. He was very merciful and kind to the Poor: Was re|paired to by many in all Kinds of Difficulties, readily bestow'd a great Part of his Time and Pains in helping them, by Coun|cil, Writing and otherwise; and refused any Consideration for it. He was an ardent Lover of his Town and Country, exceedingly concerned for their Safety and Welfare; and a zealous, wise and steady Asserted of all their Interests and Li|berties.</P>
<P>He was known to be so zealous for the Publick Interest, and so capable of maintaining it; that the Freemen of <HI>this Great</HI> and Knowing <HI>Town,</HI> the <HI>Principal Bulwark of Publick Liberty</HI> in these Ends of the Earth <HI>(and may this be ever her glorious Character!)</HI> about <HI>Sixteen</HI> Years ago very Generally chose him their <HI>Representative</HI> in the <HI>Great and General Court or Assembly</HI> of this <HI>Province.</HI> And they have found Him so Faithful, and have so highly esteem'd and confided in Him for his fixed Principles, pious Integrity, steady Courage, Know|ledge, Wisdom and excellent Powers; as <HI>every Year since</HI> successively to elect Him, in a manner unanimously, to that important Service.</P>
<P>How He behav'd and spake, both in the Assemblies of the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Province,</HI> I could not see: But by what I have heard from Others, and observed myself in our Congregation and Church-Assemblies and more private Consultations;&mdash;In all his Actions and Debates, He appear'd to have no Inte|rest of his own in view: He had a single Eye to the <HI>Publick Good:</HI> He was open to Light from Others, and gave a diligent Attention and full Weight to all they said: Sometimes he
<PB N="27" REF="005855_0025_1027014B855A7FA8">
closed with and confirm'd them: Sometimes with Respect and Decency He differ'd from them: When He differ'd, He would yet with the utmost Fairness set their Arguments in the strongest Points of Light before He answer'd them. When He happen'd to make a Mistake, which was very rare, He wou'd with a modest Freedom and ready Pleasancy acknow|ledge it. He had a clear Voice, a lively and natural Way of Speaking, a proper Style, and in Affairs of Moment wou'd express Himself with decent Courage and a suitable Pathos. He always argu'd upon solid, clear, undeniable, cogent and consistent Principles, which approv'd themselves to the honest Consciences of those who heard Him.</P>
<P>He appear'd in <HI>Argument</HI> to have a very extensive View of Things. He had an excellent Faculty in a few clear Expres|sions, of stating a Controversy, ranging all the Arguments first on one Side and then on the other, giving each their full Weight, and then comparing them together and drawing up a clear and decisive Judgment. And He seem'd to have so compleat a Survey of his Idaeas in their Connections with Themselves and with the clearest Truths; that while He was arguing, I have seen his Spirits move in his Countenance with so much Pleasure as even to make his Face to shine; with a seeming secret Satisfaction in the Clearness of his own inward Prospects, and that He was also giving the same to Others. But when a <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>great Importance</HI> laboured, and He was apprehensive of Hurt or Danger to the Publick unless He exerted Himself;&mdash;Then He would rise in Voice and Argu|ment to a great Degree of noble Warmth:&mdash;But not so as to discompose Himself or disconcert his Views:&mdash;<HI>his</HI> Warmth was not a Warmth of Anger, but of raised Power and Ear|nestness in his Country's Cause:&mdash;And I have heard, that in the Publick, when He has been warmest and most earnest, He was then the strongest and the brightest.</P>
<P>He was wholly regardless of <HI>Commission Offices</HI> either of <HI>Profit</HI> or <HI>Honour:</HI> And so far from Seeking them, as He has told me, that as a <HI>Representative</HI> He was even afraid of the <HI>Offer,</HI> lest it should have some unhappy Influence to byas Him to the Hurt of his Country. And when they have been of|fer'd, He has excus'd Himself from receiving them. He look'd upon them to be dangerous <HI>Temptations</HI> in a <HI>Trustee</HI> of <HI>the People,</HI> which few are able to resist. So deeply sensible of This is the Wisdom of the <HI>British Nation</HI> collected in their
<PB N="28" REF="005855_0026_10270150A3337598">
<HI>Parliament,</HI> from their consummate Observation and Know|ledge of the Weakness of Humane Nature; that they have made an Act to remove every Man from the House of Com|mons, or annul his Election, tho' ever so worthy, who re|ceives a Commission even from the Crown itself, while He fits among them. And even the infinitely higher Wisdom of GOD Himself declares to Persons in Places of Publick Trust, Exod. xxiii. 8. <HI>Thou shalt take no Gift: For the Gift blindeth the Wise, and perverteth the Words of the Righteous:</HI>&mdash;For our more solemn Admonition, repeats the same in <HI>Deut.</HI> xvi. 19:&mdash;In Eccl. vii. 7, <HI>A Gift destroyeth the Heart:</HI> And Prov. xxix. 4, <HI>He that receiveth Gifts, overthroweth the Land.</HI></P>
<P>Not but that Some, thro' Divine Assistance, have been, are, and 'tis hopeful will be, firm and noble Proofs against these Temptations: Yet <HI>these Scriptures</HI> signify, that this is their natural Tendency, and we must have unusual Assistance to repel their Influence.</P>
<P>He survey'd the <HI>Earth,</HI> and saw how <HI>Nineteen Twentieths</HI> of the Nations and Countries of it are wretchedly enslaved, yea many among them who formerly enjoyed the greatest Liberty, and what vast and dangerous Advantages the re|maining Powers have, if they were Bent that Way, to enslave the Rest. And tho' by the glorious <HI>Revolution,</HI> by the most happy <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> and our present mild and gentle Government, there appears no Danger from the Rulers Themselves; yet even our Affections to the best of Rulers may thro' Unwariness create Preceedents that may be fatal under Others: And therefore He tho't He ought to be in|dependent, and to be watchful on the Side of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property:</HI> To help the civil Ruler as far as is consistent with the common Good, to avoid all unnecessary Variance, and to keep most carefully to our happy <HI>Charter Constitution,</HI> our <HI>Legal Privileges,</HI> and the <HI>Publick Interest.</HI></P>
<P>As for several Years, <HI>this Great Town</HI> has chosen Him MODERATOR in all their Meetings, and the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI>&mdash;their SPEAKER in General Assembly; He has remarkably behaved Himself in these Honourable and Publick Places, with such AEquanimity, Fairness, Wisdom and Capacity, as has constantly given them great and univer|sal Satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the midst of all the Honours Others did Him, He con|tinued modest, and did not seem in the least exalted. In the
<PB N="29" REF="005855_0027_10270153DE1C6F60">
midst of all his Services, I never heard Him speak in Com|mendation of them. And a modest Pleasancy much a|dorn'd his Conversation.</P>
<P>But before I close his amiable Character, I must mention One Thing more, which I apprehend the <HI>real Spring</HI> of his <HI>Publick Spirit,</HI> of all his Conduct, and of all his Steadiness; which I believe was the very Life and Soul of all, and this was <HI>his excelling Piety.</HI> It was his Piety that sanctified and ruled all his Powers and made Him Faithful.</P>
<P>As He was religiously educated so I have been informed, that He appeared tho'tful and hopefully disposed from his early Youth.</P>
<P>When He was about <HI>Ten Years of Age,</HI> the DIVINE SPIRIT was pleas'd to visit Him with very powerful <HI>Con|victions,</HI> and give Him such Discoveries of GOD and of his Sin and Misery and Need of a SAVIOUR; as to put Him into great Distress and set Him a Praying alone, for Mercy, even with Agony; as some of the Family happened to ob|serve and hear. Yet He judged these Convictions to be ineffectual, 'till the Death of his Mother, about 8 Years after; when they revived with a greater Power and Clear|ness:&mdash;When He saw more of his Heart Corruptions, Spiri|tual Impotence and Need of a DIVINE <HI>Sanctifier, Quickner</HI> and <HI>Helper;</HI> and for this He most earnestly Prayed.</P>
<P>And when He came to be about <HI>Twenty Years</HI> old, the So|vereign GOD Began more Sensibly to form his Soul for all this Eminence. For then the HOLY SPIRIT was pleased to ope|rate in and enlighten Him more than before; to discover the SAVIOUR in his Loveliness to Him, and lead Him heartily to embrace Him; to give Him <HI>a new Turn</HI> and <HI>Biass;</HI> to make Him an holy Temple fit for Himself, and to take up his Re|sidence in Him. Then it seems He drank very deep of the Gospel Spirit; to live by Faith on CHRIST, and derive all Grace and Consolation from Him. And hence it was, that of all the Divines in <HI>England,</HI> Dr. OWEN was his Favourite Author: Who seem'd to be One of the Greatest, deepest, most Learned, Spiritual, evangelical and solid Writers, that has lived since the Apostles Days: And whose <HI>Writings</HI> are of such a Nature, that they are not like to be relished but by Persons who have much of Mr. <HI>Cushing's</HI> serious and evange|lical Spirit, as well as contemplative Genius and Capacity. Of our <HI>New-England</HI> Divines I think He chiefly valued the
<PB N="30" REF="005855_0028_1027015702F74700">
Pious, learned, judicious and accurate Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> your re|nowned Pastor.</P>
<P>The Writings of these excellent Men, full in <HI>the Doctrines of Grace,</HI> appeared to Him to be exactly agreable to his own Experience, as to the Spirit and Design of the Gospel: Which is to lay us low in <HI>Sense</HI> as we are in <HI>Reality,</HI> that GOD in CHRIST may be more highly exalted; and lead us as naked and empty to CHRIST, that we may be cloathed with his Righteousness and filled out of his Fulness. Their Writings helped greatly to enlighten his Mind in the Nature, Connec|tion and Influence of Gospel Truths, to satisfy and settle his Judgment, promote his Sanctification, excite and guide his Practice, and yield Him settled Peace and Comfort. And so judicious was He in <HI>Matters</HI> of <HI>Conscience;</HI> that in some of the most difficult Cases wherein I have been troubled myself, I have been surpriz'd to find that in a few Minutes Time He would so clearly state and resolve them, as at once to relieve me of my Perplexities.</P>
<P>In the Power of <HI>those excellent Principles,</HI> I have Reason to believe He lived, kept close to GOD, and <HI>walked with Him</HI> every Day; First in his <HI>Closet,</HI> and then in his <HI>Family,</HI> and then in all his <HI>Affairs</HI> and <HI>Managements.</HI></P>
<P>For the Preservation of these Principles with the Power and Practice of Godliness in the <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Land</HI> He was deep|ly concerned. He had a very sorrowful Sense of the Decay of Religion 'till the late Revival: And when it surprizingly came, He greatly rejoiced. He knew 'twas founded on those evangelical Principles: And that those vital Principles and the Power of Godliness will for ever live, revive, decay and die, as they always have, together. But He exceedingly grieved at the Imprudences and Extreams of Some, and the indiscri|minate Opposition of Others. For He cou'd wisely distin|guish between the Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD and the mixed Infirmities and Corruptions of <HI>Men,</HI> both in the Un|sanctified and Sanctified also: And if due Distinctions had been universally made; the Opposition had been only to those Extreams and Imprudencies, and with another kind of Spirit, and a great deal of Contention and Disorder prevented. But from blending all together and reproaching the Whole, He had of late awful Views of the Withdraw of the SPIRIT of CHRIST, and therewith the Declining both of the Truths of
<PB N="31" REF="005855_0029_1027024DA6EBD248">
the Gospel and of vital Piety in this enlightned Land. It seem'd to Him as if they were hastily passing away.</P>
<P>Tho' He was for <HI>every Denomination</HI> of <HI>Protestants</HI> fully enjoying their <HI>Liberty</HI> of worshipping GOD according to the Light of their Consciences; yet He judged the <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> of our <HI>Congregational Churches,</HI> to be most agreable to the plain Scripture Purity and Simplicity of the Form and Worship in the Apostles Times: And our manner of <HI>Eccle|siastical Government,</HI> to be the most distant from Imposition and Tyranny, and the most agreable to Scriptural, rational and manly Liberty. But tho' He was against a rigid impe|rious Spirit and Manner of Dealing; yet it was a Grief to Him which He often expressed, and yet with greater Pun|gency in his Final Sickness, that the <HI>Holy Watch</HI> and <HI>Disci|pline</HI> is so much neglected, notwithstanding our solemn Cove|nant to <HI>watch</HI> over each other, <HI>admonish, exhort,</HI> &amp;c. He apprehended this Neglect was offensive to CHRIST, wou'd ruin our Purity, and is in Danger of moving Him to leave and reject us.</P>
<P>And it was his <HI>eminent Piety</HI> and lively <HI>Faith</HI> in invisible Things that was the main Spring of his <HI>Publick Spirit</HI> and <HI>emi|nent Faithfulness.</HI> It was not only his Love to his Country, and especially as containing a People of GOD, but also his ear|nest Desire to approve Himself to HIM, under a Sense of whose Eye He continually liv'd; that He gave so great a Part of his Time to the Publick Service, and took so much Pains therein. That ever since He was chosen into the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Representatives,</HI> for these <HI>Sixteen Years,</HI> with a feeble Body, his Soul has been chiefly labouring under the incessant Care of the Publick Interest: Having his Mind intently fix'd on all its Branches and Course of Affairs; carefully attending all Debates, engaging in the most difficult Matters, employ'd in Committees of the most weighty Concerns, drawing up the most important Instruments, &amp;c: And all this without any temporal Benefit, or Prospect, or Desire of any; yea, with a Mind resolv'd against receiving any in this World, yea, much to the Hurt of his Health and Earthly Interest: His great Concern being to approve Himself to GOD and serve his Country Here; and intirely leaving it to HIM the universal King of Heaven and Earth, for any Advantage, not of Debt, but Grace, Hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005855_0030_1026DF50A359C630">
Yea, He was so remarkably posses'd with a Spirit of <HI>Faith|fulness,</HI> that not only in <HI>Publick</HI> Affairs as a <HI>Patriot,</HI> but also in <HI>Private</HI> Cases as a <HI>Trustee</HI> for Others; He would be so concern'd, as He wou'd strangely lay out Himself, that He might faithfully discharge his Trust, let the Consequence be what it would to his own Interest; and He wou'd rather hurt Himself than not be Faithful.</P>
<P>And agreable to what I have shown of <HI>Piety</HI> being the Spring of <HI>steady Faithfulness,</HI> was his own Experience and Ob|servation. For in a Time of Trial, when some who had been zealous for their Country, were ready to grow discouraged and stagger; He was a Means, by taking Pains, of keeping them from yielding: But withal, He privately spake to a Friend who wonder'd&mdash;in Words of this Importance&mdash;<Q>O Dear Sir! Men may be a long while Great Patriots, from <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>political Principles;</HI> or Party or Worldly Interests; or the Applause or Esteem of Others: But there's Nothing like the <HI>Special Grace</HI> of GOD, a believing View of his pre|sent Eye and future Judgment, and an Interest and Con|science wholly subjected to Him,&mdash;to keep Men <HI>steady</HI> to the <HI>Publick Interest</HI> in Times of <HI>Trial.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In short, He was so concerned for the <HI>Publick,</HI> and this Concern has lain so close and heavy upon Him for these <HI>Six|teen Years,</HI> that it seems to have worn Him quite away. And as He has chiefly sacrified to it, a great Part of his Time and Labours, temporal Interest, Health and Ease both of Body and Mind; scarce allowing Himself and Diversion, which was the greatest Fault I have known Him guilty of, and for which I have often blamed Him;&mdash;so I cannot but think He has shortned, and so sacrific'd his Life itself in serving his Country.</P>
<P>For <HI>some Years since,</HI> in Consideration of its hurting his Body, as well as Family Interest, and growing too heavy for Him; He has often told me, He tho't He must lay down all his Publick Cares and Burthens: But then considering the State of his Country, and the earnest Desires of good Peo|ple; He cou'd not in Conscience or Affection, desert or leave Her. His Love to his Country and his Conscience to GOD, constrained Him still to go on in bearing the Burthen, 'till it bore Him into the Grave.</P>
<P>As He advanc'd in Years, and his Bodily Infirmities in|creased; so He grew in Grace, in Heavenly Mindedness and
<PB N="33" REF="005855_0031_1026DF52C5B54DC0">
Weanedness from Earthly Things. His <HI>Family</HI> were constant Witnesses of his growing Piety to GOD and Concern for their Salvation. He from the Beginning, therein <HI>Daily Pray'd</HI> with remarkable Earnestness, and <HI>Read the Scripture,</HI> some|times with Mr. <HI>Henry's</HI> Exposition: On <HI>Saturday Evenings, Lord's Days,</HI> and <HI>Lord's Day Evenings&punc;</HI> usually Read out of Mr. <HI>Flavel's</HI> Works; which he accounted some of the Best for <HI>Families.</HI> But of Late He grew more earnest in his Fa|mily Prayers than ever; as also more Particular, for every Person thereof in their Order.</P>
<P>For about a <HI>Year</HI> past, He perceived such a bodily Altera|tion and Declension; as He has often told his <HI>Consort,</HI> (with an <HI>Emphasis</HI> of Voice, as was his usual Manner of Speaking in Things of Moment) that <HI>He had but a little Time to conti|nue with them.</HI> And when she express'd her Concern thereat; He replied, <Q>My Dear, I have endeavour'd from my Youth to make <HI>Death</HI> familiar with me, and to be prepared for it: And I assure you it is no Terror to me: It won't take hold of me as an Enemy, but as a kind <HI>Friend;</HI> and it will be Welcome whenever it comes: I am ready to go whenever my HEAVENLY FATHER calls me: And then I shall get rid of this Body of Sin and Death, which has been such an heavy Clog and Hindrance to me in my Christian Course; and I warn you of my Departure, that you may be more prepared for it, and grow weaned from me! &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> last, returning from a <HI>Burial</HI> in <HI>his Father's Tomb;</HI> He said to his Consort&mdash;<Q>O I expect to live but a very little Time I believe the Tomb will be open'd next for me: [and so it was] My Work is almost Done: But when it is done on Earth, I hope to Glorify GOD in Hea|ven for ever.</Q> And He was soon after seiz'd with a Shock which seem'd to be threatning. But yet his Heart was in a happy Frame: And the nearer He approach'd to the Hea|venly World, the more inclin'd He seem'd to the joyful Employment of it; <HI>singing Psalms</HI> in his <HI>Family every Day, &amp;c.</HI> His Joys indeed were of the serener Kind, and kept nearly Parallel with his even, steady Walk and Course of Piety.</P>
<P>After this, He had <HI>some Revival!</HI> and as often as able, attended the Chair in the <HI>General Court.</HI> But yet said to his Wife&mdash;<Q>O I desire <HI>every Day</HI> to be Ready for my Great
<PB N="34" REF="005855_0032_1026DF54655EA298">
Change: For I know it is Coming, and will come in a little Time.</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>At the End of <HI>March</HI> He grew Ill again: And when I went to visit Him, which I think was on <HI>Tuesday</HI> Morning <HI>April</HI> 1; to my Surprize He told me&mdash;<HI>He never expected to go abroad again.</HI> I ask'd Him, Why so? He answer'd <HI>He felt all the Powers of Nature failing in Him,</HI> &amp;c. He spake of <HI>Dying,</HI> with Seriousness, but Serenity. After some Discourse, He desir'd Me to Pray: Yet my Eyes were so blinded I did not think Him dangerous. But He knew the universal Relaxation in Him, better than Others. In my Prayer, as I offered Thanks to GOD for Mercies receiv'd, before I asked for more; I tho't myself oblig'd to offer humble Thanks for making Him so labourious and useful in his Day. And when I had done, He said not a Word of his Services; but on the contrary, that <HI>He had no Righteousness of his own, but depended wholly on the Righteousness of CHRIST, for Justi|fication and a Title to Blessedness.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Friday Morning,</HI> I found Him extreamly feeble, began to fear, and ordered my Discourse accordingly. While I was Praying, He sunk down in his Chair and sainted: But reviving a little, <HI>He fully express'd his Hope and Faith in CHRIST, for Life Eternal.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> I found Him so exceeding ill and low, that He could hardly Speak. And when I ask'd Him&mdash;What He wou'd have us Pray for? He answer'd&mdash;<HI>For more of the Light of</HI> GOD's <HI>Countenance, and more of the Consolations of his</HI> HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P>To his <HI>Consort</HI> He said&mdash;<Q>I have strong Pains; but GOD inwardly supports me, I have inward Consolation; I have always found Him and I now find Him to be a kind and faithful GOD.</Q> And when She was speaking how hard it was to Part; He rouz'd up Himself, and said&mdash;<Q>O don't think it hard when GOD calls! Can't you part, when GOD calls? O bow, bow your Will to his! To which I am wholly resign'd, either in Life or Death. O go to GOD as your Covenant GOD, and plead his Cove|nant Mercies for <HI>Yourself</HI> and the <HI>Children:</HI> O charge them, as you know I have often done, to keep close to GOD, in the Duties of <HI>Reading, Hearing, Prayer, Medita|tion</HI> and <HI>Self Examination;</HI> which have been the Delight of my Soul almost all my Days, in which Duties I have
<PB N="35" REF="005855_0033_102701589E094908">
had sweet Communion with Him: And I trust He will be with <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Them</HI> forever, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>On the <HI>Wednesday,</HI> I plainly saw the mortal Harbingers up|on Him. But <HI>his Faith and Resignation held.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> He was evidently struck with <HI>Death.</HI> And the Town seem'd to be in a general Sorrow, while they heard he lay a Dying.</P>
<P>And <HI>eminent Person</HI> of our Communion, between whom and Him there was a mutual high Esteem and dear Affection, going to see Him, was greatly mov'd to find Him so low, and like to Die, and scarce able to speak: But approaching and asking How it was with Him!&mdash;the <HI>Decumbent</HI> reaching Him his parting Hand, cou'd only say&mdash;<Q>Dear Sir, I am now grapling with my last Enemy, and hope thro' the Blood of The LAMB to overcome Him: I am sorry I am not able to speak more to you; but I hope to meet you in Glory and to converse with you to Eternity.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Thursday Evening</HI> was the last Time I saw Him alive: And then with great Difficulty of Speaking, He had only Strength to say&mdash;<Q>I desire with the greatest Submission to resign myself wholly to GOD: And tho' if He has any Service for me to Do Here, I am willing to live: Yet if it be most for his Glory, I chuse to Depart and be with CHRIST,</Q> Which were the last Words I heard from Him, and in the <HI>Morning</HI> He Died.</P>
<P>In the last Week of his Life He seem'd to be very earnest to speak to those about Him: And if He had been able, we had doubtless heard many other excellent Sayings from Him: But his Breath was shortned and his Strength exhausted, and we lost the Benefit.</P>
<P>And thus I have endeavour'd a brief Account of this emi|nently Pious and Faithful Servant of GOD and <HI>his People: First,</HI> that GOD may have the <HI>Glory due</HI> for all the Gifts and Graces bestowed upon Him, and for all the Benefits received by Him: <HI>Partly</HI> as one of the most excelling Examples for our Honoured <HI>Representatives</HI> to remember and imitate; who knew and valued Him, and show'd both their excellent Judgment and Love to their Country, in the great Respect they always Paid Him: And as many now hear me, I can|not but think they apprehend my Account to be exactly agre|able to his constant Appearance and Conduct among them: <HI>Partly</HI> that we may more clearly see the Greatness of our
<PB N="36" REF="005855_0034_1027015CD1FA4B80">
Loss in his Death, with the Frown of GOD upon us, and be duely affected: And <HI>lastly</HI> to excite our earnest Applica|tions to HIM who has the SPIRIT of Gifts and Graces with Him; to <HI>Help us,</HI> by raising up Others as Pious and Pub|lick Spirited, able and faithful, fervent Lovers and steady Promoters of their Country's Interest and the most important Cause of CHRIST and Piety.</P>
<P>And how great is the Loss to his Family, Relatives, Friends, Acquaintance; to this Church and Congregation; to this Town and Province!&mdash;The Loss of such an emi|nent Person, for good Principles and Piety, Capacity, Know|ledge, Wisdom, Publick Spirit, Activity, Courage, Integrity, steady Faithfulness and extensive Influence; and in such a dark and threatning Time as this! How awful does the Face of GOD appear! How desolate&mdash;the <HI>House</HI> of his Deceased Servant! How vacant&mdash;his <HI>Place</HI> in this Church and Congre|gation, and in the Assemblies of this Town and Province! <HI>Joursalem</HI> hath grievously Sinned&mdash;therefore He is removed from Her&mdash;the LORD hath afflicted Her in the Day of his Anger&mdash;She weepeth sore in the Night&mdash;and tho' she has <HI>some excellent Ones</HI> yet left to give Her some Comfort; yet who can Help Her!</P>
<P>But O THOU the Hope of <HI>Israel!</HI> The SAVIOUR there|of in Times of Trouble! Why shouldst Thou be as a mighty Man that cannot save! Let our Eyes run down with Tears Night and Day; and let them not cease! For the Virgin|Daughter of thy People is broken with a great Breach, with a very grievous Blow! We acknowledge O LORD our Wickedness, for we have sinned against Thee!</P>
<P>Our <HI>Help</HI> is in the Name of the LORD, who made Hea|ven and Earth. Help us O GOD of our Salvation, for the Glory of thy Name, and for Mercy Sake! List up the Light of thy Countenance on us; that the <HI>remaining Pious</HI> may shine more brightly, and grow more Faithful! And Pour thy SPIRIT on <HI>all our Off-spring:</HI> That instead of the <HI>Fathers</HI> may continually rise the <HI>Children,</HI> who shall rightly know Thee, and dearly love and faithfully serve THEE and <HI>thy People;</HI> 'till THE ANCIENT OF DAYS <HI>shall come,</HI> with <HI>the Restitution of all Things;</HI> when <HI>the Saints of the</HI> MOST HIGH <HI>shall take and possess the Kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever:</HI></P>

<HEAD>Some Historical Account of the Deceased, from the Boston Gazette, of April 22. 1746.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOSTON,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI>22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON <HI>Friday</HI> Morning the 11th Currant, this Town and Province suffered a most grievous and inex|pressible Loss in the Death of that great and steady Patriot, the Hon. THOMAS CUSHING, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Speaker of the Honourable House of Representatives, in the 53d Year of his Age. He was the eldest Son of another zea|lous Assertor of publick Liberty, the late Honourable THO|MAS CUSHING, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> frequently a Member for this Town in the same House, and afterwards one of His Majesty's Coun|cil for the Province.</P>
<P>Mr. CUSHING the <HI>Son</HI> was born here <HI>Jan.</HI> 30. 1693, 4. entered <HI>Harvard</HI> College <HI>July</HI> 1707, took his first Degree of <HI>Batchelor</HI> of Arts in 1711, and of <HI>Master</HI> in 1714: Ap|plied himself to Merchandize, not neglecting the occasional Study of the English History and political Constitutions: And in 1724 married the youngest Daughter of that eminently pious and charitable Gentleman the late Honourable EDWARD BROMFIELD, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>In 1729, the Town being sensible of his distinguishing A|bilities and Zeal for his Country's Liberties, chose him one of their <HI>Committee</HI> to draw up <HI>Instructions</HI> for their <HI>Representa|tives</HI> in General Assembly: And <HI>May</HI> 31, 1731, and every Year since, chose him <HI>one</HI> of their <HI>Representatives</HI> by a general
<PB N="38" REF="005855_0036_10270162E8D01AD8">
Voice. <HI>July</HI> 1. 1736, the Hon. Council and House of Re|presentatives chose and would have had him to be the <HI>Trea|surer</HI> of the Province. <HI>March</HI> 13. 1737, 8, the Town chose him the <HI>Moderator</HI> of their Meeting, and so have done ever since in all their Meetings, to his late Confinement. <HI>Sept.</HI> 28. 1739. the Hon. <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Representatives</HI> chose him their <HI>Agent</HI> to the Court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to represent to His MAJESTY the great Difficulties and Distresses the People of this Province laboured under, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But his Bodily Infirmities obliged him to excuse himself. And <HI>May</HI> 26. 1742. the Hon. <HI>House</HI> chose him their <HI>Speaker;</HI> and every Year since to his Death: And 'tis suppos'd he is the first who has died in that honourable Chair among us.</P>
<P>His <HI>Character</HI> is so excellent and extensive, as would easily fill this Paper: But we only say in general&mdash;<Q>that for natural and acquir'd Abilities, Powers of Speaking and Reasoning, Piety, Judgment, Wisdom, Candor, Impar|tiality, Charity, publick Spirit, Diligence, Integrity and Steadiness, he has been one of the most superiour Persons this Land has produced.</Q></P>
<P>Though he bestow'd a great Part of his Time and Labour in serving his Country, and was very charitable; yet GOD was pleas'd so to proper his Business, as he has left a hand|some Estate. As he was esteem'd an eminent Christian, he died in an excellent Frame: has left a sorrowful Widow, with two Sons and a Daughter; and was honourably interr'd last <HI>Thursday</HI> Evening; universally lamented.</P>
