<HEAD>THE Manufacture OF POT-ASH IN THE <HI>British</HI> NORTH-AMERICAN PLANTATIONS Recommended.</HEAD>
<P>_AS no One will I believe pretend to dispute the necessary Connection between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>Plantations,</HI> so neither will it be deny'd that the mutual Advantage, arising from their Commerce with each other, is what tends very much to support that Connection; and consequently that every Ad|vantage, which their Trade receives, contributes in a greater or less degree to strengthen it. This being premis'd, I hope the following Hints, respecting the introduction of a new branch of Trade which
<PB N="2" REF="007940_0005_102E058F0DCEE980">
may be carried on between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>North-America,</HI> will (however imperfect) be esteem'd as the endeavours of One de|sirous to promote the welfare of his Country.</P>
<P>It has long been matter of Complaint, that the Articles of Ex|port from the Colonies of <HI>America</HI> are so few; and some ev'n of these of so little Value, that we are not able to make suitable returns for the Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and other Produce, which are annually imported amongst us: But as the defect complain'd of proceeds not so much from the Poverty of the Country, as from a neglect in improving the natural Advantages of it, is it not much to be wished that some Methods were taken to enquire into the Na|ture, and encourage the Cultivation of such Produce, as would be|come both useful to ourselves, and also beneficial to our Mother Country?</P>
<P>Amongst other Productions which might be named, the only One, that will here be insisted upon, is the Manufacture of <HI>Pot-Ash,</HI> for which we are sufficiently supply'd with proper Materials; and which for the Advantages to be reap'd from it, both by <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and ourselves, has been often recommended to our Improve|ment, but for want of the Method of making it, has not yet been undertaken to any Purpose: However as the necessary Process is now sufficiently known, I hope those, who have labour'd to find out so useful an Art, will not want the needful Assistance to put it into Practice; especially as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have so lately testify'd their Desire of promoting so good a Design.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007940_0006_102E0592C3CD9648">In order to give Encouragement to making <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> and <HI>Pearl-Ash</HI> in the <HI>Plantations,</HI> an Act was pass'd in 1751. to take off the Duty which was payable upon the Importation of them from thence; and since that in the Year 1755. the Sum of 3,000 &pound;. Sterling was granted to Mr. <HI>Thomas Stephens,</HI> upon certain Con|ditions to be perform'd by him, relative to the Improvement of the said Manufacture: But what those Conditions were, and whether they have been, or are like to be comply'd with, I do not pretend to determine; nor would I say how far Experience has prov'd the said Gentleman's <HI>method, and plain process for making Pot-Ash,</HI> in|sufficient to answer the end propos'd. Those, who may hereafter be made acquainted with the Method since discover'd, will upon com|paring it with his no doubt be able to judge.</P>
<P>What induc'd the Wisdom of Parliament, so far to encourage this undertaking, was doubtless the Advantage, they foresaw would arise to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> from the introduction of this Manufacture into the <HI>Plantations.</HI> It is computed that there is annually im|ported, into <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> Three Thousand Tons of <HI>Pot-Ash</HI>: which, according to a moderate Price, amounts to up|wards of One Hundred Thousand Pound, and this paid to <HI>Russia, Poland,</HI> and other foreign States in ready Money. If then the <HI>Plantations</HI> could furnish this Supply, it would be a saving to the Nation of so much Money, as they would receive it in return for their Produce and Manufactures, already so largely exported, and which, by means of this Staple, the <HI>Plantations</HI> would be enabled to take off in still larger Quantities. Besides, so long as the Nation is be|holden
<PB N="4" REF="007940_0007_102E059505C14058">
to foreign Powers for this Article, it is kept still more de|pendant, and subjected to the extravagant Prices which Foreigners may at any Time think proper to impose. I am inform'd that the Price obtain'd for this Commodity has been so various, that <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> of the same Quality has been Sold at different Times from 25 &pound;. to 70 &pound;. per Ton, which it is not likely would be the Case were it (as other Articles of Export are) regularly produc'd in the Colonies of <HI>America.</HI> These are probably some of the Reasons, which might induce the Government to promote this useful Branch of Trade; but many more might be given, why we should think it worth en|couraging amongst ourselves; some of which I shall take Occasion presently to mention.</P>
<P>Many Schemes have been projected of late, either for increasing our Export, or lessening our Import, which seem not likely to suc|ceed, for want of being fix'd upon a right Basis, viz. the Improve|ment of such natural Productions of the Country, as by being either peculiar to ourselves, or else by means of some favourable Circumstances attending the Improvement of them, we are enabled to afford as cheap at a foreign, or, at least, our own Market, as they can be brought from other Quarters, for unless this be the Case, such Schemes, like a Building without a Foundation, will fall to the Ground, as soon as the Props, which were design'd to sup|port it for a while, are taken away; how far the Manufacture now under Consideration can boast of these Advantages, may in some Measure appear from the following Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007940_0008_102E059749815980">In the first Place then I would Observe, that no Country in the <HI>British Dominions</HI> is under better Advantages, for making the best <HI>Pot-Ash,</HI> than the <HI>North-American Plantations</HI>; as they abound with Wood of all Kinds most suitable for that Purpose, and which unless put to some such Use, proves of little or no Value to the Inhabitants. It has been the Practice in settling new Lands, which are commonly cover'd with a thick growth of Wood, for the Farmer to consume as fast as possible the Wood he Possesses, with|out any farther Benefit propos'd, than to prepare his Ground for Pasturing or Tillage: And this is done either at a considerable Ex|pence, where any large Improvement is to be made, or else he is oblig'd to be content with clearing a little every Year, for want of Ability to support the Charge naturally attending the employment of much Labour thereupon. Now the Advantage which he might receive, from the produce of his Wood in Ashes, for the support of this Manufacture, would in a great measure, if not wholly, pay him for the clearing his own Land; which would naturally induce him to extend his Improvements, and consequently tend to the quicker growth and Settlement of the Country. This Consideration should I think make every Gentleman, who is possessed of landed Interest, desirous of promoting this Design. Nor needs there any Arguments to shew how beneficial it must prove to the Farmer, who for the small trouble of saving his Ashes, is thereby reimburs'd the Expence of clearing his own Land.</P>
<P>It is true that Wood, which lies contiguous to Water carriage, may be better improv'd by being carried to Market in the Seaport
<PB N="6" REF="007940_0009_102E059A33C2FDE8">
Towns, which for the most Part use it for Fuel; but in respect of a large inland Country which is destitute of that Advantage, the Wood has hitherto been accounted an useless Burthen, and conse|quently the Land rather undervalued than priz'd for the thick growth upon it; whereas on the contrary the Improvement which may be made thereof in this Manufacture, will remove that Objec|tion, and the more Wood there is upon the Land (caeteris paribus) the more it will be esteem'd; for although Transportation be still necessary, yet the assential Properties of the Wood being taken out at or near upon the Spot, and reduc'd to a compact Merchandize, become able thereby to sustain the Charge of a considerable length of Land-Carriage.</P>
<P>Farther Advantages might be shewn to arise from the Improve|ment of this Branch of Trade, such as the Encouragement given to New-Settlers to enter upon our uncultivated Lands, the Labour employ'd in the Manufacture itself, the additional Freight given our Ships thereby, and the promoting of Industry and Frugality amongst us, the only Means to retrieve our decaying Circumstances, and enable us to support the Burthen of a distressing and expensive War. Nor would it be difficult to prove that the Farmer, the Merchant, the Tradesman, the Sailor, and in short each individual, will receive more or less Benefit from this so useful an undertaking. But what I would chiefly insist upon is the very great Advantage arising to this Country, from having so good a Staple of Export, and a saving thereby of so much Money as this Branch of Trade would con|stantly
<PB N="7" REF="007940_0010_102E059F05BE4A88">
Produce, of which the following may in some Measure serve as an Estimate.</P>
<P>It is suppos'd, that each Sett of Works, for carrying on the Manu|facture of <HI>Pot-Ash,</HI> will have the range of ten Miles round for its sup|ply, less than which will not be sufficient; and I would here by the way Caution such who may undertake to erect Works for this Purpose, that the Place they fix upon be at least twenty Miles distant from any other Works of the like Kind, lest they not only injure their Neigh|bour, but themselves, by cutting off the Prospect of a sufficient sup|ply of Ashes. Each Sett of Works, under such Advantages of ob|taining Stock, will I presume at the least annually produce twenty Tons of good <HI>Pot-Ash,</HI> which at the lowest Rate it has ever been Sold for viz. 25 &pound;. would amount to 500 &pound;. Sterling. And if twenty of these Works were to be erected within the Limits of the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> (which I think a very moderate Number) there might be annually exported out of that Province alone 400 Tons of <HI>Pot-Ash,</HI> which at the beforemention'd low Rate would amount to 10,000 &pound;. Sterling. To which if we add what might be manufactur'd in the other Provinces and Plantations on the Continent, we shall soon find a sufficient supply for the home Consumption, and consequently an additional Trade acquir'd there|by of 100,000 &pound;. Sterling per Annum, and all this out of our own Produce.</P>
<P>But it may here be enquir'd, whether, besides the Quantity, we are able to make it also equal in Quality, and afford it at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="8" REF="007940_0011_102E05A0A07D42C0">
Rate, as it is obtain'd from foreign Countries. To which I answer,</P>
<P>First in regard to the Quality,</P>
<P>That what has been lately sent from hence, made in the Method which I would recommend, has obtain'd the top of the Market; and were Justice done the Exporters of it, would I be|lieve have been esteem'd preferable to, and consequently worth more than the best <HI>Russia Pot-Ash</HI>; but for Reasons, which may under the next Article be hinted at, we must be content at Pre|sent to find it is esteem'd at least as good, and fetches an equal Price.</P>
<P>As to the second Enquiry, respecting the Price it may be afforded at from the Plantations, it will be necessary to Observe,</P>
<P>That <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> having been hitherto chiefly imported into <HI>Eng|land</HI> from <HI>Russia,</HI> and paid for as has before been observ'd in Money, the Advantages arising from that Branch have center'd wholly with the <HI>Russians,</HI> and the Company trading thither; it is therefore natural to suppose that the said Company will (though contrary to the Interest of their Country) oppose the Introduction of this Manufacture into the Continent of <HI>America</HI>: And 'tis not without reason suppos'd, that the Price is at this Time kept low, in order to discourage if possible those who might attempt to set it forward in the Plantations. However as the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> been before shewn) testify'd their Desire of promoting so
<PB N="9" REF="007940_0012_102E05A34B72BD88">
good a Design, it is reasonably presum'd, that they will assist the Undertakers, so far as to enable them to get the better of this Op|position, and establish a Trade which appears so conducive to the Interest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as that of her <HI>American Colonies.</HI></P>
<P>I have not been able to obtain so good Imformation as I could wish, respecting the Price of <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> however from the best I can get, the ordinary Price of good <HI>Russia Pot-Ash,</HI> and what has been esteem'd by the <HI>Soap-Boilers,</HI> and others who use this Com|modity, to be a reasonable One, is 40 &pound;. Sterling per Ton. I find by the <HI>London</HI> Price Current for the Year 1751. that it was then 48 &pound;. and, by information from a Person employ'd in the <HI>Soap-Boiling</HI> Business in <HI>London,</HI> that soon after, it advanc'd as high as 70 &pound;. since which it has fallen, but for what Reason I am not able to say to 25 &pound;. which is the lowest Price that I can find it was ever sold for, and which was the Price this present Year. Now from what Knowledge I have gain'd of the Method lately practis'd, and the Charges attending the making it in this Country, I judge it may be afforded at the <HI>London</HI> Market for 35 &pound;. even at this Time, when the Charges and Risque, which attend the shipping of all Merchandizes to Market, occasion'd by the War and extraordinary Premiums for Insurance now demanded, are perhaps higher than ever has been known here: which Price appears upon a Medium to be lower than it has commonly been sold for. And as I have no sufficient Grounds to believe, that the Price of <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> from <HI>Russia</HI> will be lower than it has been in common Years, (allowing
<PB N="10" REF="007940_0013_102E05A5C8786178">
none to be made in the <HI>Plantations</HI>) it will appear from thence cheaper for <HI>England</HI> to receive it from us at the rate of 35 &pound;. than to import it from <HI>Russia,</HI> ev'n allowing other Advantages to be Equal, which however cannot be granted if the foregoing Observa|tions are admitted to be true.</P>
<P>The only Objection, that I imagine will be made to the Improve|ment of this Manufacture amongst us, will be the Danger appre|hended to arise from too great a comsumption of our Wood; but as I take it for granted that none will be cut down, but such as I have before observ'd from its Situation will not offord to pay a Transport; or with a farther Design of improving the Land clear'd thereby, This Objection can avail but little. However should it be otherwise, Experience teaches us that where a Peice of Wood|land has been clear'd at a proper Season of the Year, and left in a State of rest, the Wood has renew'd itself again, in greater Abundance, and in the course of twenty or thirty Years become of a moderate Bigness; so that where due Care is taken there will be no Danger of our wanting a proper supply of Fuel, should there be no Coal-Mines to be open'd, which seems highly probable may be found in many Parts of this Continent.</P>
<P>Thus much may suffice for the present Design, which was only to hint in general at some of the Advantages which may arise from making <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> in the <HI>Plantations</HI>; And to stir up if possible some able Pen to write upon this Subject, which I should be glad the Publick might have the Benefit of seeing handled in such a Manner
<PB N="11" REF="007940_0014_102E05A761845E38">
as it justly deserves. I have only one Proposal to make, which I believe will be judg'd necessary towards maintaining the Credit of this Manufacture, should it be establish'd upon this Continent, which is that an Assay-Master should be appointed with Liberty of sub|stituting Deputies where they may be necessary, in Order to try the Quality of what <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> may be made, and that none be clear'd for Exportation, without proper Assurance of its having pass'd the necessary Examination. For want of these Precautions there have been frequent Complaints, and that not without Reason, of the bad Quality of Merchandizes imported into <HI>Great-Britain</HI> from the <HI>Plantations,</HI> which has tended very much to their discredit, and not only defeated the Designs of the Parliament, which has generally encourag'd the Manufactures of the Colonies, but often prov'd in the End detrimental to those very Persons, who for the Sake of a little sordid Gain have endeavour'd to impose upon the Market with unmerchantable Commodities.</P>
