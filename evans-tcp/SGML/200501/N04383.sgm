<HEAD>Just arrived from LONDON, For the ENTERTAINMENT of the CURIOUS and OTHERS, And is now to be SEEN, by Six or more, in a large commodious ROOM, at the House of Mr. Vidal, in Second-Street; The Solar or Camera Obscura MICROSCOPE, INVENTED by the Ingenious Dr. LIBERKHUN.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the most Entertaining of any MICROSCOPE whatsoever, and magnifies Objects to a most surprising Degree. The Animalculae in several Sorts of Fluids, with many other living and dead Objects, too tedious to mention, will be shewn most incredibly magnified, at the same Time distinct; also the Circulation of the Blood in Frog's Foot, a Fish's Tail, also in a Flea, and Louse, where you discover the Pulse of the Heart, the moving of the Bowels, the Veins and Arteries, and many small Insects, that one Thousand of them will not exceed the Bigness of a Grain of Sand; with their Young in them; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ls in Paste, which have given a general Satisfaction to all that ever saw them. This Curiosity was never shewn by any Person that ever travelled. Price <HI>Eighteen Pence.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Each Seed includes a Plant, that Plant, again</L>
<L>Has other Seeds, which other Plants contain:</L>
<L>These other Plants have all their Seeds, and those,</L>
<L>More Plants again, successively inclose.</L>
<L>Thus, every single Berry that we find </L>
<L>Has, really, in itself, whole Forests of its kind.</L>
<L>Empire and Wealth one Acorn may dispense</L>
<L>By Fleets to sail a Thousand Ages hence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each Myrtle Seed includes a Thousand Groves,</L>
<L>Where future Bards may warble forth their Loves:</L>
<L>So<HI> Adam'</HI>s Loins contain'd his large Posterity,</L>
<L>All People that have been, and all that e'er shall be.</L>
<L>Amazing Thought! what Mortal can conceive</L>
<L>Such wond'rous Smallness!&mdash;yet, we must believe</L>
<L>What Reason tells: for Reason's piercing Eye</L>
<L>Discerns those Truths our Senses can't descry.</L>
</LG>
<P>Note, <HI>The</HI> MICROSCOPE <HI>may be seen at Gentlemens Houses, giving half an Hour's Notice, the Sun permitting only from Ten in the Morning to Four in the Afternoon, in my Room.</HI></P>
<P>THE unparallel'd MUSICAL CLOCK, made by that great Master of Machinery DAVID LOCKWOOD: This great Curiosity performs by Springs only; it is a Machine incomparable in its Kind; it excels all others in the Beauty of its Structure; is most Entertaining in its Musick; and plays the choicest Airs from the most celebrated Operas, with the greatest Nicety and Exactness: It performs with beautiful Graces, ingeniously and variously intermix'd, the French Horn Pieces, perform'd upon the Organ, German, and Common Flute, Flageolet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as Sonata's, Concerto's, Marches, Minuets, Jiggs, and Scot Aira, compos'd by Corelli, Alberoni, Mr. Handel, and other great and eminent Masters of Musick. Price <HI>Eighteen Pence.</HI></P>
<P>This beautiful Curiosity has been shewn twice before the KING, in his Royal Palace at St. James's, where His Majesty was pleas'd to make an Observation on the Excellence of its Beauty, and declar'd, He thought it the Wonder of this Age. It is allowed by all who have seen it, to be more worthy to adorn a King's Palace than of being expos'd for a common Sight.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This surprising Piece of Machinery has given such general Satisfaction to the Lovers of Art and Ingenuity, that the Nobility are continually commanding it to their Seats to satisfy their Curiosity, and is to be SOLD by the Owner EDMUND RISINO.</P>
<P>The Inside of this Machine may be view'd by Gentlemen and Ladies, and is to be seen from Eight in the Morning till Eight at Night.</P>
<P><HI>For the Evening Diversion,</HI></P>
<P>THE Clock and Camera Obscura, with the Battle of Dettingen, and several Italian Land|skips, representing Armies, both Horse and Foot, going through their Exercise at the Word of Command: Likewise Views of Ships fighting at Sea, with the Fish playing above Water, and Variety of Country Dances by Figures, six or eight Foot high, perform'd in a beautiful Manner by the Camera Obscura. This Curiosity is esteem'd one of the best Pieces of Painting of the Kind that ever was brought from <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Fore SEAT <HI>Two Shillings.</HI> Second Ditto <HI>One Shilling.</HI> To begin at Seven a Clock.</P>
