<OPENER><SALUTE>AMERICANS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY that name, at the request of a respectable number of my fellow townsmen, assembled for that purpose, I ad|dress you at this time&mdash;thereby to remind you of the Birth Day of Our COUNTRY&mdash;and to invite you agreeably to the practices of most of our Fellow Citizens, to commemorate the ANNIVER|SARY of HER FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE, trust|ing to the candor of my auditors, from the consideration of my constant avocations.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, there has been no period since our revolution&punc; when a celebration of this day, was more important&mdash;none, when
<PB N="6" REF="035724_0004_1006AA22DAB0A058">
a review of the conduct and intentions of the patriotic many, by whose firmness and integrity, virtue and magnanimity our <HI>Nation|al Sovereignty, Independence</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> were achieved&mdash; and surely none, when a comparison of these, with the principles, views and conduct of the leaders of that nation, who, not content with dealing out promiscuous murder, and unheard of rapine with|in the limits of their own extensive country; have not failed to at|tempt by their diplomatic skill, or predatory armies to revolution|ize and overturn the government of every nation, within the vortex of their insatiable thirst for domination&mdash;A thirst that seems to have no bounds short of a colossal reach over both Earth and Heaven.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE repeat, that no period, since the existence of our country as a nation, hath yet arrived, when a consideration of these things was more important to Americans.&mdash;For at no period was the <HI>Freedom and Independence, National Honor</HI> and <HI>Hap|piness, Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of our <HI>Country</HI> ever in greater Jeopardy.</P>
<P>WHILE the Tyrannic arm of Britain, was extended to crouch our necks beneath the galling yoke of slavery&mdash;While our har|bors were thronged with her rapacious Fleets, and our shores pos|sessed by her blood thirsty armies&mdash;While our Western borders, at the instance of this merciless Foe, were invaded by the Savages of the Wood&mdash;While the bye path of the farmer was waylaid for his death&mdash;and the darkness of night, was expelled by the blaze of his dwelling&mdash;While the blood of the son, fat'ned the field of the father&mdash;and the war hoop of death robbed the babe of its mother&mdash; While all these, with accumulating horrors, hung trembling over our heads&mdash;Still had we less to fear&mdash;The justice of our cause&mdash; the purity of our conduct&mdash;and a favoring Heaven, banished dis|pair, and left us great support.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035724_0005_1006AA27F6365B60">IT was then, that our Rulers failed not to appeal to the Supreme Judge of the World, for the rectitude of their intentions&mdash;or to place their reliance upon a protecting providence, for their deliver|ance.&mdash;It was then that this people forsook not entirely their GOD, nor despised his commandments&mdash;The foe then did no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> wear the garb of friendship&mdash;and traitors were scarce known in the land.&mdash; Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Philosophy, or D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">morality had not dared to show its disor|ganizing head&mdash;and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> temples of our GOD, and our Holy Reli|gion were held in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> repute&mdash;The Sabbath was considered as hallowed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Heaven.</P>
<P>WITH these ideas of GOD and RELIGION, our National existence commenced&mdash;And under the auspices of the Omnipo|tent hand of the former, and the benign influence of the latter to establish our national Sovereignty and Independence, secure our welfare and prosperity, and to provide for the safety and happiness of the people, a Constitution and Government, the voluntary work of our own hands, and the object of our free Election; was made and adopted by ourselves&mdash;A Government, second to none on Earth&mdash;One that emanates from the source, from whence all pro|per and genuine authority is derived; namely, from the people&mdash; A Government that operates alike upon the rich and the poor&mdash; that subjects the first magistrate of the Union, to the suit of the last <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ggar, that lays by the way side, if by the former, the latter hath been injured. In fine, a government that is predicated upon prin|ciples, that exhibit for its object, and produce for its effect equal justice to all, and a perfect enjoyment of every religious, natural, and social Right.</P>
<P>UNDER such a Government, and the smiles of Heaven, the growth and prosperity of America, and the happiness of her citi+zens,
<PB N="8" REF="035724_0006_1006AA29B82F2DC0">
could not but exceed all calculation. But no sooner were we thus situated, in the possession of the rewards of a government, founded in wisdom and good policy, and supported by justice, rec|titude and impartiality, than we find our nation insulted, our citi|zens plundered, and this our happy constitution in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">idiously <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">sailed.</P>
<P>IN the first instance, by daring and jealous Britain, for our justice and integrity to her rival foe, for our independence in impartially rendering and paying to France, that, which was justly her due, and to which she was equitably intitled, and for the per|formance of which our national honor had been solemnly pledged by compact. For this, and merely this, though jealously suspecting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the naval arm of Britain, to the dishonor of that nation, for a while shamefully ravaged upon our defenceless commerce. At length however, upon the firm and dignified demand of our Chief, Our WASHINGTON &mdash;a man born for his Country's Salva|tion; they staid their piratical hand, and repentant of their injus|tice, by solemn treaty, stipulated to make redress&mdash;their rapine ceas|ed&mdash;but scarcly ceased, when France our supposed friend and faith|ful ally, renewed the scene; that very France, with whom we had always most sacredly kept our treaties; for whom all America had really felt, and evinced the sincerest friendship, and for whose suc|cesses in the commencement of her revolution, while we suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> her only object, was the reform of the abuses of her own govern|ment, we as unfeignedly rejoiced&mdash;This nation it is, that recom|mences this war of plunder upon our remaining defenceless com|merce. But it now comes out, that she is only openly pursu|ing, what she had long been secretly plotting, viz. dominion and gain for herself; dependence and ruin for us; for it now appears, that this nation from our first struggles for liberty and independence to the present moment, hath been, and still is in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">idiously hostile to
<PB N="9" REF="035724_0007_1006AA2E71CA1BE8">
our dearest rights and best interests. It was the perfidious policy of the Cabinet of this nation, in our treaty of Amity and Peace with England, to prevent the acknowledgment of our Indepen|dence by the latter. It was the cunning and design of that Court, that, in this treaty we should not have with England, a participation of the fisheries of Newfoundland. It was to check the foreseen growth and prosperity of these States, that the Cabinet of France, in this treaty, used every possible means to saddle America, with a compensation to the refugees, for their confiscated estates, and to perplex and retard the negociation, thereby to embarrass us, with additional burdens&mdash;the difficulties and expences of another cam|paign. Indeed, her sole object was to render us independent of other nations, but entirely dependent upon and devoted to herself; and to effect this with more certainty, she never failed to exert every nerve to prevent our forming commercial connections with any power, excepting those only, who were wholly under their sover|eign management.</P>
<P>THIS was the conduct of France to us, during her regal adminis|tration, and while she perfidiously stiled us "<HI>Her dear friends and Allies.</HI>"</P>
<P>SINCE that period&mdash;Since a five headed monster hath swayed the sceptre of that nation, dipt in the blood of her murdered citizens, and haunted by the ghosts of myriads, from neighboring States, who have fallen innocent victims to her savage ferocity, her con|duct to us&punc; though not less in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">idious, hath been vastly more injurious. For in addition to her treacherous schemes already mentioned, be|fore the present war in Europe commenced, she used every possible art, to induce America to join her in the then expected rupture; not that she expected any material assistance from us, that she knew was impossible; but, that by involving us, in this war, it would inevitably destroy our commerce, and consequently our revenues,
<PB N="10" REF="035724_0008_1006AA3056961EA8">
and in the infant state of our then new Federal Constitution, in all probability, oblige us to throw ourselves upon her protection against the fleets and armies of the combined powers; and to bring this a|bout, the revolutionists of France falsely and secretly insinuated, that it was the intention of our country to join them&mdash;and so ma|naged it with our minister at Paris, by the power of their skill, that by his folly, or knavery, these insinuations were greatly strengthen|ed&mdash;a circumstance that contributed not a little to the British de|predations upon our property&mdash;But finding that our government was determined to take and maintain a neutral stand in these com|motions, and foreseeing that such a station, if supported, could not fail of establishing our national importance and Independence upon the firmest basis, and of exceedingly encreasing the growth and prosperity, wealth and resources of our country, and consequently that her plan of universal domination would thereby be defeated in America, if successful in Europe; she, till now, by most of our countrymen, supposed a sincere friend, renewed as before stated, the war of plunder, and pursued our still defenceless navigation, with a rapacity, ten fold more atrocious than that of our former foe. At the same time plotting, and by her diplomatic skill or foreign in|trigue secretly executing a more dangerous war against the govern|ment of our Country, by attempting to divide and withdraw the affections of the people from the same. And when, with the mo|deration and respect due to a former friendship, our government re|peatedly demanded retribution for her unprovoked and cruel attacks and spoliations, our Envoys, who had been sent with assurances of friendship and good will, were treated with indig|nity and contempt, and our government through them, grossly in|sulted. A tribute was insolently demanded at our hands, before these haughty robbers, would deign to hear our wrongs; and that too, with a menace, that the fate of conquered nations should be our own, if we dared to refuse; with a boasting assurance that "if our envoys presumed to return without a compliance to their will," such was
<PB N="11" REF="035724_0009_1006AA38191A8B50">
the diplomatic skill of France, and such the means she possessed in America, that she was able with <HI>her French party,</HI> to throw the blame of the failure, or rupture of the negociation, on the Federal|ists of our country, on the men, of whom our WASHINGTON and our ADAMS are the Heads. Well may they boast of their skill, if it is to have such an effect, or if its great success in Europe, is to be considered as a cause of exultation. A skill, or as it is sometimes called foreign intrigue, which means for the accomplish|ment of the design, however dark and daring, the unlimited use and practice, of flattery, bribery, corruption and all other kinds of ve|nelity, with atheism and irreligion to bring up the train&mdash;the latter being <HI>a corps de reserve,</HI> to relieve the qualms of conscience of any that may have some mental difficulties, before the villany is com|pleted&punc; &mdash;or, to take their own term, which comprehends the whole, it is the practice of French philosophy, and the revolutionary prin|ciples of the grand Republique&mdash;A philosophy, and principles that disorganize the whole system of creation and set at defiance Heaven, Earth and Hell. By these GOD and Religion are done away at once. In pursuance of these, the Sacred Bible hath in that coun|try been burnt upon the public square&punc; The Holy Sabbath hath been impiously erased from the register of time, and the houses of worship, to which the people had been in the habit of orderly re|sorting, for pious and devotional purposes, are now either convert|ed to stalls for the sale or storing of goods, or visited on the decade or tenth day (which they have instituted instead of the Sabbath) as a day of riotous festivity and mirth&mdash;In fine to conquer earth, the Rulers of this nation have not hesitated blasphemously to assail Heaven, and denying the existence of a GOD, and futurity, have arrogantly declared, that death was only one eternal sleep&mdash;And by this doctrine, and it consequences, perjury is made no crime. Of course, the sanctity of an oath, as well as of religion is wholly at an end. A doctrine most impious in its nature and most dreadful in its consequences. Destroy religion, and you take from man his greatest,
<PB N="12" REF="035724_0010_1006AA4120ECCD70">
nay more, his only source of mental consolation and happiness&mdash; Destroy the sanctity of oaths and you not only destroy reli|gion, but you take away the very cement, whereby soci|ety is preserved, and without which it cannot have an ex|istence&mdash; &mdash;As shocking as this idea is to the mind of a christian, the inquisitive world have long been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that it now is, if it hath not always been, a favorite part of the French revolu|tionary system. And that the object of the Revolutionists of that nation is not, merely to revolutionize monarchical governments as they first pretended, but the whole world, and to oversee the chris|tian religion, or to use their own words, to go on to "dethrone both the Kings of the earth, and" (blasphemous thought) "the Kings of Heaven," until they have brought every society to their own standard, and established for themselves universal domination.&mdash; But I would not be understood to say, that all who have favored their revolution had these views.&mdash;No&mdash;there were no doubt ma|ny, who only wished for a reform of the abuses of their own gov|ernment. But, alas! if you wish to find their names, you must search the register of the the murders of that country&mdash;and you will there probably find, that their honest wishes were the very cause of their being so numbered.</P>
<P>IN our contest with Britain, her object was submission, and claiming the right, she openly avowed the design&mdash;In our disputes with France, her object, if possible, is far worse, but pretending no right, she cloaths herself under the specious guise of friendship.&mdash; And here lies our danger&mdash;The bold and open enemy, we prepare to meet, and with confidence oppose; but the black hearted wretch who wears the mask of friendship, draws his hidden dagger while he smiles.</P>
<P>IN every country in which the grand Republique hath ever sent a Minister, she hath never failed insidiously and secretly to sow her
<PB N="13" REF="035724_0011_1006AA469C9FB2A0">
poisonous revolutionary principles, taking care always properly to water them with her favorite <HI>douceur,</HI> and to cultivate them gratis by a free circulation of newspapers and other publications calculat|ed to cherish and foment division, thereby to separate the people from their government; to create disaffection and distrust toward their rulers; excite prejudices against, and discontent with their an|tient and established institutions, and encourage sedition and opposi|tion to the laws and administration&mdash;These are their weapons&mdash;this the use of her diplomatic skill&mdash;by the exercise of this, they prepare the way for their armies, who then have but little else to do, but to gratify their lusts and their avarice. By these means every govern|ment in Europe hath been assailed, and all that were in any degree republican, actually overthrown, and the citizens plundered, butch|ered or disarmed. This has been the fate of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa, Holland</HI> and <HI>Geneva</HI>&mdash;And thus hath fallen the once happy <HI>Swit|zerland,</HI> the oldest ally, and the most ready friend that the French nation ever had. <HI>Switzerland,</HI> like <HI>America,</HI> consisted of a num|ber of Republics, united together, for their common defence, but independent of each other as to their municipal government&mdash;they enjoyed individually the unalienable right of obeying their own laws and of being governed by their immediate fellow citizens.&mdash; The stipulations of this confederacy, suggested by natural and local considerations, were, that each Republic should mutually guaranty each others independence, possess sovereignty within itself, and be|come subjects of the Union, whenever any one of them should be threatened with danger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mallet du Pan.</HI></NOTE> A nation, whose general and special laws and customs, being equally respected by the governing and govern|ed, equally protecting both&mdash;producing ready obedience justice and safety to and from all, and leaving from local circumstances, few rich, none poor, but all industrious and oeconomical, could not fail of securing to the citizens that happiness and prosperity, which had successfully been their lot for five hundred years and upwards&mdash; This nation, full of vigor, naturally brave and warlike, by this di|plomatic

skill, was assailed&mdash;the base and the wicked of the rulers and people were corrupted and bribed; the weak and the igno|rant deceived and led astray; while the great body of the nation, unsuspicious of the friendship of their ancient ally&mdash;heedless of the consequences of the calumny, falsehood and misrepresentations, in|sidiously circulated against their government, its magistrates and of|ficers, by the emissaries sent, and the wretches bribed for their ruin; and thinking of no danger remained in a state of lethargy and unpre|paration, until "an army of myrmidons, commanded by the Satel|lites of the French Directory," had entered the confines of this, till then, happy land, and actually begun their wonted work of promis|cuous slaughter and general rapine. An Army as <HI>Du Pan,</HI> feel|ingly expresses himself, furious in victory, and raving with lust and avarice. "The rustic abodes of order, of industry and of morals, were given up to the brutality of foreign soldiers&mdash;Those fields fertilized by freemen, under the protection of tutelary laws, are overflowed with the blood of their cultivators&mdash;No respect for age, or sex&mdash;Whoever escaped the hand of the murderer, escaped but to be plundered and disgraced&mdash;No asylum for innocence, modesty and decency&mdash;The victors barter the lives of parents, for the chas|tity of daughters&mdash;Humanity for money&mdash;Then violate their con|tracts&mdash;The towns are thrown open&mdash;property of all kinds public and private is swept away at once&mdash;the citizens are disarmed&mdash;and disarmed too, under the colour of the Rights of man&mdash;The plun|derers assume the garb of legislators&mdash;A constitution arrives from Paris&mdash;A code of laws calculated to perpetuate their servitude, and increase their calamities, convoyed by soldiers, they force upon the conquered under the thunder of cannon," leaving them only the liberty of being slaves to the grand Republique.</P>
<P>WRETCHED Country&mdash;you slept too long! <HI>Americans,</HI> pro|fit by their loss&mdash;take warning by their ruin&mdash;And believe me,
<PB N="15" REF="035724_0013_1006AA4FF6B72808">
when I tell you, that the same scene, hath long been preparing&punc; by the sons of anarchy and revolution&mdash;by the enemies of peace and good order,&mdash;by the atheists and philosophists of France&mdash;by their emissaries and our traitors, to be reacted on the theatre of <HI>America.</HI> A scene, in which the christian religion, is to give place to the <HI>Age of Reason</HI>&mdash;And the only remaining republican government on earth, where liberty is not licentiousness, and equality is not in|justice, is to be changed for a constitution imported from France, and insolently established for our government by the lordly man|dates of her domineering tyrants. This base design, more than Britain ever dared to show, was contriving by that perfidious na|tion, while she was pretending for us the utmost friendship&mdash;And to the shame of our country, there never hath been wanting <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> corrupt enough to aid and abet them&mdash;but thank Heaven these traitors are comparitively few&mdash;yet it is too true, that their ex|ertions and activity are in an inverse ratio to their numbers.</P>
<P>BUT to increase their party, recourse hath long been, and still is had, in every shape, and in every quarter, to the sovereign power of diplomatic skill. And so vast and infinite hath been its rami|fications, that it is far beyond the length of a discourse suitable for this day to expose them&mdash;Suffice it to say, that no practices upon the skill, philosophy&punc; and revolutionary principles before men|tioned, have been omitted by <HI>France,</HI> her minister and her tools, or party in <HI>America.</HI> All that was done in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> prior to the marching of her armies, hath been done here&mdash;And, <HI>Ameri|cans,</HI> the time, I have no doubt, hath been once fixed by the Di|rectory of <HI>France,</HI> when the Revolutionary Tocsin of that nation, was to have founded in <HI>America</HI>&mdash;when an army of foreigners was to have landed in one or more of our southern sister States, and there being joined by another of traitors, were to have dealt out to you, French liberty and equality, under the standard of their revolution,
<PB N="16" REF="035724_0014_1006AA5A9220FDC0">
in the same manner as they had before done to unfortunate <HI>Swit|zerland.</HI> In the same manner, your dwellings and the earnings of your hands, were to have been assailed&mdash;your country&mdash;your reli|gion&mdash;your constitution&mdash;your government and laws, laid prostrate, and yourselves left abject slaves.</P>
<P>THIS is but an imperfect picture of the scene, to which the conduct of the French minister <HI>Genet,</HI> the founder of the Jacobin societies in <HI>America</HI>&mdash;of a <HI>Randolph</HI> the author of the flour merchant bribery&mdash;of the foreigners, the secret promoters of the <HI>Whiskey Insurrection,</HI> and of many others too numerous to men|tion, hath so alarmingly contributed. But GOD be praised, by the wisdom and foresight, vigilance and exertion of our govern|ment, and the blessing of Heaven, the designs of our enemies have been seasonably discovered, and our country is prepared and pre|paring for a defence.</P>
<P>YET though repeatedly baffled and defeated, the restless and insatiable ambition of France, will never suffer her to desist, while she retains the power of disturbing, or there remains one single gov|ernment on earth unsubjected to her controul&mdash;Nor while this is the case, will her boasted French party here ever desert her; hence therefore, we still have the utmost need of all our exertion and vi|gilance and of the continuance of the same; For in this party there exists a secret and dangerous opposition to our Government&mdash; From their exertions it is, that the Jacobin papers continue to teem with insidious calumny, falsehood and misrepresentation against our rulers, the laws and their administration&mdash;from their interest it was, that the late Virginian and Kentuckian resolutions dis|graced those States; from them arose the late insurrection in seve|ral of the counties of Pennsyvania; the quelling which must have
<PB N="17" REF="035724_0015_1006AA63F9AF49C8">
cost our country many thousands; from them the unwarranted and totally groundless complaint against the constitutionality of the Ali|en and Sedition Acts, so called, against which no falsehood that ma|lice could invent, and no slander that tongue could utter hath been spared &mdash;Laws that their own treasonable and seditious practices rendered necessary to the salvation of our country; for such were the number of foreigners who interfered with, and intruded them|selves into our governmental concerns, and such the gross falsehoods and misrepresentations&punc; the calumny and abuse, that the conduct of the former became dangerous to the sovereignty and indepen|dence of our nation and the practice of the latter, too intolerable to be borne without redress. The best administered government on earth, as well as the best man, may be falsely and maliciously slan|dered. And is it reasonable and proper that such slander should go unpunished? As it concerns the individual, the old law, as it hath long stood, is sufficient and universally admitted to be just and right. As it respects the government is not the crime the same? or if there is any difference, when government is the object of such slander, is it not more heinous? That wicked and unprincipled men will do these things is but too true&mdash;For we find that the Revolutionists of France, the very leaders of those domestic opposers to our civil gov|vernment, do not hesitate to defame, slander, abuse, and ridicule the very administration and government of Heaven&mdash;But for such slan|der, the sacred laws of a righteous GOD hath assigned a punish|ment.</P>
<P>THE Alien Act, affects those persons only, who are foreigners, and whose continuance at large in the government is dangerous to its peace, good order and welfare, and for this reason, and this on|ly, such dangerous foreigners are liable to be ordered from our

country, with leave however, to take with them or dispose of at their election, the whole of their property; but the peaceable and quiet foreigner, who meddles not with governmental concerns, hath nothing to fear&mdash;Is it possible, that a citizen of America, can ob|ject to this law? A law that affects only foreigners, who are con|spiritors against our government, and disturbers of our peace? Do true Americans want such for their friends and neighbors? No&mdash; The opposers of this law must be foreign agents, and agents for our country's ruin, or the tools of such&mdash;Before this law passed, fifty thousand, nay ten times that number of unarmed men might have been landed on our shores from unarmed vessels, and although we might suspect that their designs were hostile to our country, yet without sufficient evidence upon which to ground such suspicion, such was the too great lenity of our government to foreigners that they could not be removed; there being no person vested by law with that authority, and before we might have discovered their in|tentions, they might with the aid of their secret friends be paraded under arms ready for our distruction&mdash;From many circumstances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The late discovery in</HI> Philadelphia <HI>of a large quantity of French uniform, concealed in small parcels, in different places, I would refer the reader to, as one ground for this suspicion.</HI></NOTE> that have appeared, we have good reason to suspect that something of the kind hath been in agitation.</P>
<P>THE Sedition Act, which hath the same opposers though more inveterate, if possible, is in fact an amelioration of the Common Law, for this act requires the opposers of our government to speak the truth <HI>only,</HI> and provides, that if their charges against govern|ment are true, let them be ever so scandalous and defamatory, abu|sive and atrocious, the publishers are nevertheless justifiable; but if <HI>false and malicious, then only are they punishable.</HI>&mdash;Do any

persons but Jacobins, or the <HI>boasted French party in America</HI> oppose this Law? Do these opposers find fault with it, because in speaking of government and its administration, they are confined to the truth? Or is it because it checks them in the practice of wilful falsehood and malicious slander&mdash;favorite revolutionary weapons? Is it because these Jacobins never make use of scandal or defama|tion, either against men or against measures, when they can do it with truth? Is it because this law is calculated to punish such liars, and malicious circulators of slander? Are falsehood and misrepre|sentation, tending to scandalize government and its administration, and to bring the same into contempt and disrepute, the essential qualities of a Jacobin? Does this law strike at the root of such practices; and is it therefore, that they complain of it? Do they conceive that this law so accurately describes a Jacobin by trade, that it might as well have expressed him by name? If these things are so, then one may as soon expect to find a tattler without a tongue, as a Jacobin not a liar. If these are not so, and the <HI>truth</HI> is the <HI>object,</HI> then there is nothing to fear from the law, for it <HI>pun|ishes only wilful and malicious dealers in falsehood and misre|presentation against our government.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the same party arises the calumny heaped upon our gov|ernment, on account of the Land or House Tax&mdash;a tax that bears heavy upon the rich, but exceedingly light upon the poor&mdash;this law so much complained of, and so much misrepresented, lays the taxes or burdens upon the property, and not upon the poll, whether the man is rich or poor&mdash;yet to the astonishment of common sense, the same hath been made a handle of not only to abuse and vilify the federal government, but also to influence the election of State officers&mdash;to buy votes for <HI>our</HI> General<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Great pains was taken by persons sent into many dif|ferent places in the District of Maine, a short time before the last election for Governor, to represent this law as burthensome and unjust, and to induce the uninformed but honest part of the community to believe, that if the advocated candidate was elected, it would be in his power to repeal the law.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>BUT notwithstanding, this then was, and still is the alarming situation of our country, and notwithstanding the checks, that the enemies of our government have repeatedly experienced by the ex|ertion of our rulers, yet we find they seize every possible op|portunity and continue to exert their utmost skill to op|pose our administration, to paralize the measures thus necessarily adopted for the defence of our nation, and to reprobate the con|duct of those, who are faithfully exerting themselves in pursuance of those measures&mdash;we find them endeavoring to extend the baneful influence of Jacobinical measures and sentiments as well from state, as to federal administration; in order, if possible, by some means or other, to defeat our national system of defence&mdash;thereby to ac|complish their treasonable designs of throwing our country into the arms of their dear friends and paymasters, the Directory of France.

<P>From this our solemn and sincere lamentation, for the loss of our Commander in Chief&mdash;I turn myself to you, my friends and brothers, whose garbs and insignia, distinguish you as the militia of our land&mdash;and consequently the walls&mdash;the bulwark of our country&punc; At all times&punc; but especially like the present, the peace, good or|der and welfare of the community in republican governments, de|pend in a great measure upon a regular and well disciplined militia &mdash;You&punc; therefore, my fellow soldiers, so I address you, for I assure you that I boast of the honor of being enrolled in your number, must bear in mind, that as guardians of your country's rights and honor, sovereignty and independence&mdash;and as protectors of the lives and property of your fellow-citizens, of your wives and your children, you are responsible for their preservation and security &mdash;and from the importance of your charge, and the consideration of

<P>RETURNING to you, my respectable auditors, I must add, that a frequent review of past events, and a comparison of them with existing circumstances and situations cannot fail of producing good, if we will but accept the blessing.

<P>IT will be certainly important, and happily so indeed, if there|by we learn duly to estimate our blessings, and to guard against our dangers. From a wish to inculcate the practice of the former, I have in a summary manner reminded you of the situation of America during her revolution, of the principles and conduct of her rulers, and of some of the troubles and difficulties through which our coun|try waded, for the securing and establishing our unalienable and dearest rights, our sovereignty, our freedom our independence. To caution you against our dangers, I have brought to your recollec|tion the outrages and injustice of haughty Britain; the insidious policy and piratical depredations of all grasping France; her boasted diplomatic skill, and treasonous party in this country&mdash; From all which I conclude, that America hath need of her utmost
