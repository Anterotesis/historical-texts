Shall he recapitulate the consequences which have resulted from the revolu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on, or, with a prophetic enthusiasm, anticipate those which yet may ensue in the future happiness of our country?</P>
<P>When I look around upon an audience so numerous and respectable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> when I consider the novelty of my own situation, and the arduous task assigned me, I feel a diffidence, which I cannot conceal.

first settlements in America. Men, whose minds had but just been libe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rated from the shackles of the Papal tyranny, and whose hearts wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> impressed with the awful dignity and sublime simplicity of the sacre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> writings, (not long before committed to their hands,) were fired wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indignation at such severe restraints.

<P>Perhaps there is no passion, which rouses the human mind to such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> height of <HI>magnanimity</HI> and <HI>heroism,</HI> as the indignation, which religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> enthusiasm feels, under the scourge of oppression.</P>
<P>The love of religious and civil LIBERTY is intimately, and necessaril<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> allied: Our ancestors, who first settled in America, keenly felt thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> united force; and, during the progress of their arduous undertaking<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stood in need of all their inspiration.</P>
<P>The very great equality in the circumstances of the first emigrant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the natural independence inspired by a situation at the distance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> three thousand miles from the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent country, were favourable to civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liberty. The same period, too, which, during half a century, saw a vio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lent contest between the <HI>rights</HI> of the people and the <HI>prerogatives</HI> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Crown, furnished new emigrations to America. These consisted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men, who were universally the partizans of LIBERTY.</P>
<P>The forms of government which were established by the colonists were in a high degree democratical. A division of the legislative pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, in imita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the British Constitution, was very generally and judi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciously retained. At the same time an <HI>hereditary order</HI> of nobility, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>unequal, unnatural,</HI> and <HI>absurd</HI> arrangements for the election of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> members of the British House of Commons were, from obvious causes with equal propriety discarded.</P>
<P>In addition to the circumstances already mentioned, calculated, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may observe, to inspire our ancestors with rational ideas of Liberty, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> preparing the way to INDEPENDENCE, some of their civil institutions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> covered the highest wisdom, and conduced directly to the same illustriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> event.

<P>The war, which broke out in the year 1755, and which was com|promised by the treaty of Paris hastened on this gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rious EVENT.

The conduct of that war, under the auspices of the immortal CHATHAM, was the most glori|ous in the British annals; but its conclusion left the nation emcumbered with an immense addition to her debt. Hence originated the <HI>system</HI> of American taxation&mdash;To carry this <HI>system</HI> into execution, there ensued a <HI>black</HI> catalogue of oppressive measures, taken up injudiciously and upon slight consideration, la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d aside upon the appearance of opposition, ca|priciously reassumed, and eventually, with a fatal blindness and obsti|nacy, pursued, from the <HI>era</HI> of the <HI>Stamp Act</HI> to the final di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the empire.</P>

The remembrance of that day, when thy green bosom was sprinkled with the blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of thy sons, is like the shock of the lightning, like the inspiration of a divinity!</P>
<P>The commencement of hostilities animated the freemen of America, with one soul. Whilst <HI>imagination</HI> fails in the attempt to paint that ar|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of enthusiasm, which from Saint-Croix to St. Mary, agitated the bosom of America; PHILOSOPHY will forever, with exultation, re|collect the dignifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d proceedings of the American CON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ESS, and with a sacred pride, hold them up, for the imitation of future ages&mdash;So great fortitude in the midst of dangers, such cool and temperate fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mness in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st alarming and tumultuous periods, such candor and sob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iety triumphing over the phrenzy of passion, in no <HI>deliberative bodies,</HI> of other ages or countries, were before ever exhibited!</P>
<P>The situation of America, from the commencement of hostilities to the public declaration of INDEPENDENCE, was a <HI>solecism</HI> in the history of political revolutions. The whole continent rung with the din of arms hostile to the invading troops; but the people had not yet contemplated the idea of a separation from Great Britain. The Congress pursued the most spirited measures for the prosecution of a defensive war; and y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t they presented to his British Majesty a humble and loyal petition for the redress of grievances.</P>
<P>This petition, to the perpetual disgrace of British politics and huma|nity, was treated with indignity. Contracts were entered into for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hire of <HI>German mercenaries.</HI> Measures the most <HI>irritating</HI> and <HI>alarming</HI> were adopted by the British administration. The consequence was such as might reasonably have been expected; the eyes of America were opened to see the natural issue of such a contest, and the dream of re|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nciliation was dispelled. The idea of petitioning with one hand, whilst the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er brandished the sword of defiance, was finally di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carded. The propriety also of streng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hening the cause of America, with foreign alliances, early occurred To negocia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e these with any probability of success, required a renunciation on the part of America of all political connection with Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025713_0007_0FCF01751FB30D20">The ERA had now arrived, for the establishment of the EMPIRE of LIBERTY, in the NEW WORLD.</P>
<P>The GENERAL CONGRESS, on the ever memorable fourth of July, in the year 1776,
"appealing to the SUPREME JUDGE of the world for the rectitude of their intentions, solemnly published and declared that the United Colonies were, and of right ought to be, <HI>free</HI> and INDEPEN|DENT STATES; and that they were absolved from all allegiance to the <HI>British Crown.</HI> And for the support of this declaration, with a firm re|liance upon the protection of Divine Providence, they mutually pledg|ed to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor."</P>
<P>The remembrance of that august transaction we now celebrate. This day, this glorious day, by the united voice of the millions of America, is dedicated to the exultations of PATRIOTISM, the triumphs of LIBERTY, and to <HI>gratitude</HI> to HEAVEN!</P>
<P>The sacred "<HI>pledge</HI>" of American "<HI>honor</HI>" was not forfeited; her
"reliance upon the protection of Divine Providence,"
was not in vain; and the Supreme Judge of the world, to whom she had appealed, justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d
"the rectitude of her intentions,"
by accomplishing, after an eight years war, the object for which she had fought!</P>
<P>The most illustrious actors on that theatre of honor, have survived the storm of war; they enjoy the rewards of patriotism, in the highest offi|ces of the government; they still continue to bless their country.&mdash; Whilst the names of WASHINGTON, ADAMS, and HAMILTON, give a lustre and dignity to virtue; dear to America, and forever sacred be the memory of THOSE, who fought and bled in so righteous a cause.</P>
<P>Are not the spirits of MERCER, MONTGOMERY, and WARREN, from the regions of immortality, looking down, with the sublimest transport, on the present felicities of their country? Do I not hear a celestial choir chanting that consolatary Ode

<P>The dissolution of the Colonial governments, at the time of the de|claration of Independence, was followed by the establishment of Con|stitutions chosen by the citizens of the respective Colonies&mdash;Each Colony became an independent republic&mdash;To combine these in one general union, articles of <HI>confederation</HI> were adopted&mdash;By virtue of these arti|cles, the federal representatives were invested with little more than a mere nominal power, or the authority of recommendation&mdash;The <HI>pres|sure</HI> of the war, and the <HI>enthusiasm</HI> of Liberty, produced a patriotism and unanimity which superseded the necessity of energetic laws, and conceal|ed the weakness of the Federal Government.
