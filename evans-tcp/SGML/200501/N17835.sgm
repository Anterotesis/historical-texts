<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>LANDS</HI> called the GENESEE TRACT, IN THE COUNTY of ONTARIO, and STATE of NEW-YORK, IN NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THE lands generally known by the name of the Genesee Tract, are situated in the back parts of the State of New-York, and contain upwards of Two Millions of Acres, mostly good Arable Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of the Lands.</NOTE> forming nearly an oblong square of 80 miles in length from south to north, and 42 miles wide from east to west.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="023101_0005_0FBC30A89FE4EAC0">These lands were granted to Messrs. Gorham and Phelps, the original purchasers from the State of Massachussets, in the year 1788. And this grant was afterwards confirmed by the six nations of Indians, who, on receiving a valuable considera|tion, alienated the whole of this property, and soon after these nations removed themselves and families to a distant country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation, Latitude, and Longi|tude.</NOTE>The south-east corner of this tract is in latititude 42&deg;, lon|gitude 82&deg;, miles west from the river Delaware; and 77 miles west from Philadelphia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dis|tance from the great Towns in America.</NOTE>The actual distance of the eastern boundary, from the Hudson's River or Albany, is about 140 miles. From Phila|delphia, by the nearest road, the distance may be about 180 miles. And not more than 200 miles north of the propos|ed new city of Columbia, the intended seat of government of the United States, as will appear from the map hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>But the peculiar advantages which distinguish these lands over most of the new settled countries of America, are these following:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="023101_0006_0FBC30AC66A23E58">1st, The uncommon excellence and fertility of the Soil.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The superior quality of the Timber, and the advan|tages of easy cultivation, in consequence of being generally free from underwood.</P>
<P N="3">3d, The abundance of Grass for cattle in the woods, and on the extensive meadow grounds upon the lakes and rivers.</P>
<P N="4">4th, <HI>The vast quantities of the Sugar Maple Tree, in every part of the tract</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Sugar Maple is likely to become extremely valuable, in consequence of a very important discovery which has been made, of the mode of graining the sugar which is extracted from the juice or sap which is drawn from this singular tree.</P>
<P>It has been known by the Indians time immemorial, that a species of sugar or a saccharine substance, answering this purpose, could be extracted from the sugar maple; and not only the Six Nations, and other Indians inhabiting the back countries from Pensylvania to Canada, were accustomed to use it, but also the first settlers upon the North River and New England, who, having learnt from the Indians how to boil up the juice, have for many years supplied their families with this kind of sugar, exhibiting the appearance of a kind of black cake, and answering all the common purposes of sugar.</P>
<P>But until within the last two years, it was not ascertained that the sugar of this tree was capable of being grained, so as to become an article of merchandise; neither was it satisfactorily authenticated, till very lately, that there was a sufficient number of these trees to produce that quantity of sugar which could enduce the pursuit of this object upon a large scale.</P>
<P>The surveys, however, that have been made (particularly of the forests in the Genesee country) as well as the lands in the back parts of Pensylvania and New-York, incontestibly prove that this tree is so abundant as to afford a resource for the supply of all North America with sugar; and the arrival of a quantity of this sugar at Philadelphia and New York, in spring 1790, prove also, that the quality is equal to any muscovado sugar imported from the West Indies.</P>
<P>An American farmer of great respectability, who had been for many years acquainted with the usual way of making this sugar, being desirous of improving the method, he obtained instructions from a sugar refiner in Phila|delphia; and with the additional advantage of this information he began his experiments in February, 1790, at Stock-port, about three miles below the junction of the Mohock and Popatchtunck branches of the Delaware.</P>
<P>He soon found that the business was only in its infancy, and that, by a departure from the old practice of boiling down the sap, and graining the syrop, great improvements might be made, so as to produce sugar in colour, grain, and taste equal to any imported.</P>
<P>The result of his experiments have fully confirmed his hopes on this head, for the sugar he has made and sent down to Philadelphia, in the opinion of well qualified judges, is equal to the best sugar imported from the West India Islands. The respectable individual who made these interesting experiments, whose judgment is much to be relied on, as well from his experience in the business, as from his known and established character for cando<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r and integrity, <HI>is clearly of opinion,</HI>
<Q>that four active industrious men, well provided with materials and conveniences proper for carrying on the business, nay turn out in a common season, <HI>which lasts from four</HI> to six weeks; forty hundred weight good sugar; that is, ten hundred weight to each man.</Q></P>
<P>If four men can effect this, and produce as much sugar in six weeks, (equal to 15 shillings sterling per day to each man, at 6d. per pound) what must be the produce of the separate or associated labours of many thousands of people who now inhabit and may inhabit, the immense tracts of lands which abound with the sugar maple tree? It is an interesting aera in the history of the world. A resource for commerce and productive industry, which till now was not even in the contemplation of those individuals who have been long in the practice of converting this sugar to domestic purposes.</P>
<P>It is here to be remarked that <HI>no cultivation is necessary</HI>; that no contingency, such as hurricanes or bad seasons, can disturb the process; that neither the heavy expence of <HI>mills, engines,</HI> machinery, or a system of planting, which occupies negroes for the whole of the season, is necessary at all to make the maple sugar:&mdash;The process occupies six weeks, from the middle of February to the end of March; and the whole of the buildings, and other articles necessary for carrying it on, are to be obtained at so trifling an expence, as to be within the reach of any person of common industry, whose conduct in life can entitle him to the most moderate credit.</P>
<P>Upon the scale of four men, and for the purpose of making 40 cwt. of sugar, all the implements that are necessary, are these following:
<LIST>
<LABEL>&nbsp;</LABEL>

</LIST></P>
<P>These are the whole implements that are required for a sugar work in Ame|rica, all which, it is to be observed, excepting the sixteen kettles, the two iron ladles, and the four augurs, are prepared by the workmen themselves from the resources they find in the country.&mdash;If, however, a large work were to be established, the expence would probably be less, in proportion, than upon the scale of four men engaged in this pursuit.</P>
<P><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SEASON FOR TAPPING.</HEAD>
<P>By trials in February each year, it will be discovered when the maple tree ought to be bored, for the purpose of extracting the syrup or sap, as in that month, sometimes earlier and sometimes later, it begins to yield a sufficient quantity for commencing business.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TAPPING OR BORING.</HEAD>
<P>Four hundred trees, each tree bored with two holes on the south side, and also with two holes on the north side of the tree in the early part of the season, with screw augurs from half to one inch, according to the size of the tree. And towards the middle of the season, a like number of trees to be bored in the same manner.</P>
<P>This upon the Scale of Four Hands. Eight hundred trees in all, to be tapped.</P>
<P>The sap of the second tapping will be found richer and more productive than the first.</P>
<P>At first, the augur should go no deeper into the tree than &frac34; of an inch, and to be deepened afterwards to the extent of 2&frac12; inches, as the manner of the saps running may render necessary.&mdash;The hole to be made in a slanting or descending position, that the sap may run freely in frosty weather.&mdash;In these holes there should be fixed spouts to project from the tree 12 inches, but not to enter the orifice more than half an inch. Elder wood spouts to be prepared in the season.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PRESERVING THE SAP OR SYRUP.</HEAD>
<P>In the early part of the season, the sap will keep during frost, but as the spring advances, it will be necessary to boil it the day after it is drawn from the tree, to prevent souring and fermentation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BOILING THE SAP.</HEAD>
<P>A smart fire should be kept up while the sap is boiling, and a table spoonful of slacked lime put into each 15 gallon kettle, while the sap is warming, and before it boils, to raise the scum, and give the sugar a grain.</P>
<P>When the scum rises, it should be skimmed off.&mdash;When the liquour is reduced one half, discharge it into the one half of the kettles continuing the process, till the whole is placed in one kettle, filling up the empty ones as soon as possible with fresh sap.</P>
<P>When the liquor in the last or aggregate kettle becomes a syrup, it should be strained through a woollen cloth, before it becomes too thick.</P>
<P>When thus cleaned, it should stand in buckets or other proper vessels 12 hours, that the whole sediment may fall to the bottom, and the clarified syrup to be poured off into a kettle or boiler. The sediment to be boiled up again with fresh sap.</P>
<P>In graining, cleaning, and whiteing the sugar, the method of the sugar-bakers to be used.</P>
<P>In graining the sugar, pour the syrup into a boiler, after having stood 12 hours, and place it over a smart fire of charcoal, so as to prevent any flame, using butter or hog's-lard to keep down the sap when it rises to the top. This should be carefully attended to when the sugar is graining.</P>
<P>The mature state of the boiling is known by taking a little of the syrup from the boiling stick, and trying if it ropes or draws into a thread between the finger and thumb&punc; then it should be put into a tub or cooler, and stirred inces|santly until the grain can be felt, when it is in a fit state to be poured into the moulds.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MOLASSES AND VINEGAR.</HEAD>
<P>When the trees of the second tapping become poor, which may be about the 31st of March, or perhaps not till the 10th of April, the number of fresh tapped trees will yield a sap, of which may be made good molasses, and excel|lent vinegar.</P>
<P>Rum has also been made of an exceeding good quality from the rich sap.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>In Maple Plantations, it may be useful to cut down all other timber which grow intermixed with the sugar trees, and also those of that specie which are not thriving.</P>
<P>It is not yet ascertained from experience, how long a tree may be tapped with success.&mdash;But there are <HI>instances among old settlers on the North River, of trees being tapped for</HI> 50 <HI>years, and still continue to yield their sap in season, the same as new trees</HI>; and it is even asserted by persons of some experience, that these trees become more valuable, yielding a sap of a richer quality the more they are tapped.</P>
<P>How far a careful cultivation in plantations may still encrease the quantity, and enrich the juices drawn from this valuable tree, remains to be ascertained by experiment.</P>
<P>The presumption, however, is in favour of still greater advantages from cultivation and art.</P>

The soil is in general the same as the Genesee pre-emption: but they do not possess equal advantages, in being exempted from the land-tax for 15 years.

About 20 miles south from the Friends Settlement, near the head of the Seneca Lake, is the village of Culvers, and four miles further on is Cathrines Town. In the neigh|bourhood of these villages there is a district of country bounded by the Pensylvania line on the south, and the heads of the Seneca and Cayuga Lakes on the north, and running east from the Genesee southern boundary, to Owega Creek, in which there are near 600 families settled.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON EMIGRATION.</HEAD>
<P>IF any country in Europe has more people than can be com|fortably subsisted in it, some of those who are incommoded may be induced to emigrate. As long as the new situation shall be found to be preferable to the old, emigration may possibly continue; but when many of these, who in the old countries in Europe interfered with others in the same rank in the com|petition, (for farms, shops, business, and other means of subsistence) are gradually withdrawn to another country, the inconvenience of that competition ceases; the numbers remain|ing no longer half starve each other.&mdash;They find they can now subsist comfortably, and, though perhaps not quite so well as those who left them; yet the inbred attachment to a native country is sufficient to over-balance a moderate difference, and thus the emigration ceases naturally of itself, without the necessity of any legislative restrictions, which are neither ne|cessary nor politic.</P>
<P>The waters of the ocean may move in currents from one quarter of the globe to another, as they happen in some places to be accumulated, and in others diminished; but no law beyond the law of gravity, is necessary to prevent their aban|doning any coast entirely. Thus the different degrees of hap|piness
<PB N="2" REF="023101_0042_0FBC30F816822D30">
of different countries and situations find, or rather make their level by the flowing of people from one to another, and where that level is once found, the removals cease. Add to this, that even a real deficiency of people in any country, occasioned by a wasting war or pestilence, is speedily supplied by earlier, and of course more prolific mar|riages, encouraged by the greater facility of obtaining the means of subsistence; so that a country half depopulated would soon be re-peopled, till the means of subsistence were equalled by the population. All encrease beyond that point must perish, or flow off into more favourable situations.&mdash;Such overflowings there have been of mankind in all ages, or we should not now have had Thirteen States in America, containing near four millions of people; but to apprehend absolute depopulation from that cause, is to suppose that by the ebbing and flowing of a great river, in time its waters would be exhausted.</P>
<P>That great national advantages may be acquired to the old countries in Europe, from whence people emigrate has been shewn in one point of view: But if such overflowing of people should go to another country where land is easily acquired, and population encouraged by early marriages, there is another point of view in which the parent state may be benefited by the removal of the people it can spare. This benefit will arise from predilections for the manufactures of their native country,
<PB N="3" REF="023101_0043_0FBC30F9948518F8">
hence an extended consumption of the labour of the people who are engaged in manufactures in the old countries, from whence these people emigrated; and in so far as these people multiply in a greater degree than they could have done in Europe, and in so far also as they, by means of cheap land and agricultural pursuits, can consume more of the manufac|tures than they could have done in their own country, from being richer and better able to buy them; in the same pro|portion are these people rendered more useful to the state, than if no emigration had taken place, seeing that their labour is rendered productive abroad, which was not the case in their own country.</P>
<P>The new settlers in America finding plenty of subsistence, and land easily acquired whereon to seat their children, seldom postpone marriage through fear of poverty. This natural increase is therefore in proportion far beyond what it would have been had they remained in Europe.</P>
<P>New farms are daily every where forming in those immense forests, new towns and villages rising, hence a growing de|mand for the manufactures of their mother country, to the greater employment of the manufacturer, and enrichment of the merchant. By this natural augmentation of the de|mand for manufactures, the strength of an empire is encreased, and its members are multiplied.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="023101_0044_0FBC30FB3A655358">Was this country already attached to Great Britain by the tie of consanguinity, a similarity of language, religion, and natural affection secured by these means and the mutual advantages which would arise from a treaty of commercial alliance;&mdash;it would afford an additional strength to the British empire far superior, and more to be depended on, than any advantage that ever could have been acquired by the most successful conquest.</P>
<P>These national advantages would certainly more than equi|ponderate with any ideal inconveniences that might be suffered by the emigration of superfluous cottagers, who would remain in poverty and misery in Europe, useless to themselves, and a burden to their country. By removing to enjoy plenty and happiness, in cultivating the vast unoccupied tracts of fertile land in North America, they would not only ease their own country of its supernumerary inhabitants, but as they advance in opulence, consume its manufactures.</P>
<P>The overflowings of Germany and France are now emigrat|ing to America; and it might, in the course of a few years, be matter of serious regret if Britons and Irelanders, who have a much better right, did not endeavour to cement, by this intimate connection and a natural alliance, counties which are by nature designed for the mutual aggrandizement and sup|port of each other.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS FOR The Information of those who wish to become SETTLERS in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Production of a very celebrated American Statesman and Philo|sopher, written a short Time previous to his Decease.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Franklin.</HI></NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THE governments in America give every assistance to strangers that can be desired from protection, good laws, and perfect liberty.&mdash;Strangers are welcome, because there is room enough for them all, and therefore the old inhabitants are not jealous of them, the laws protect them sufficiently, so that they have no need of the patronage of great men; and every one will enjoy, in security, the profits of his own industry.&mdash;But if he does not bring a fortune with him, he must work and be industrious to live.&mdash;One or two years resi|dence, give him all the rights of a citizen; but the government does not hire people to become settlers.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="023101_0046_0FBC31021BC86570">Land being cheap in that country, from the vast tracts still void of inhabitants, so that the property of an hundred acres of very fertile soil may be obtained at an easy rate.&mdash;Hearty young men, who understand the husbandry of corn and cattle, which is nearly the same as in Europe, may easily establish themselves there.&mdash;A little money saved of the good wages they receive there, while they work for others, enables them, in a few years, to buy land and begin their plantation, in which they are assisted by the good will of their neighbours, ad-some credit. Multitudes of poor people from England, Ireland, Scotland and Germany, have, by this means, in a few years, become wealthy farmers, who, in their own countries, where all the lands are fully occupied, and the wages of labour low, could never have emerged from their low condition wherein they were born.</P>
<P>From the salubrity of the air, the healthiness of the cli|mate, the plenty of good provisions, and the encouragement to early marriages, by the certainty of subsistence in cultivating the earth, the increase of inhabitants by natural generation, is very rapid in America, and becomes still more so by the acces|sion of strangers&mdash;Hence there is a continual demand for more artisans of all the necessary and useful kinds, to supply those cultivators of the earth with houses, and with furniture and with utensils of the grosser sorts, which cannot so well be brought from Europe; tolerable good workmen in any of
<PB N="41" REF="023101_0047_0FBC310359EB8B38">
these mechanic arts, are sure to find employ, and to be well paid for their work; there being no restraints preventing strangers from exercising any art they understand, nor any permission necessary. If they are poor, they begin first as servants or journeymen; and if they are sober, industrious, and frugal, they soon become masters, establish themselves in business, raise families, and become respectable citizens.</P>
<P>Lastly, persons of moderate fortunes and capitals, who having a number of children to provide for, are desirous of bringing them up to industry, and to secure estates for their posterity, have opportunities of doing it in America, which Europe does not afford. There they may be taught useful and profitable mechanic arts, and may follow the same without incurring reproach on that account, but on the con|trary, acquiring respect by such pursuits and abilities. The small capitals laid out in lands, which daily become more valuable by the increase of people, affords a solid prospect of ample fortunes thereafter for their children. Instances have been often known of large tracts of land being bought, on what was then the frontiers of Pensylvania twenty years after, selling at a profit of many hundred per cent., without any improvement whatever made on them.</P>
<P>The establishment of manufactures have rarely succeeded in America, the country not being yet so ripe as to encourage
<PB N="42" REF="023101_0048_0FBC3104FA8BA3F0">
private persons to set them up; labour being generally too dear there, and hands difficult to be kept together, every one desiring to become a master, and the cheapness of land inclining many to leave trades for agriculture.&mdash;Things that are bulky, and of so small value as not well to bear the expence of freight, may often be made cheaper in the country than they can be im|ported; and the manufacture of such things will be profitable whenever there is a sufficient demand.&mdash;The Farmers in America produce, indeed, a good deal of wool and flax, and none is exported, it is all worked up; but it is in the way of domestic manufacture, for the use of the family.&mdash;The buying up quantities of wool and flax, with the design to employ spinners, weavers, &amp;c. and to form great establishments, producing quantities of linen and woollen goods for sale, has been several times attempted in different provinces; but these projects have generally failed, goods of equal value being im|ported cheaper; for these unnatural operations must be sup|ported by mutual prohibitions or high duties on the importation of goods, by which means the manufacturers are enabled to tax the home consumer by greater prices. Therefore the government of America does nothing to encourage such pro|jects; the people are by this means not imposed on either by the merchant or mechanic: If the merchant demands too much profit on imported shoes, they buy of the shoe-maker; and if he asks too high a price, they take them of the merchant; thus the two professions are checks to each other. The shoe-maker,
<PB N="43" REF="023101_0049_0FBC310678177B58">
however, has on the whole a considerable profit upon his labour in America, beyond what he had in Europe, as he can add to his price, a sum nearly equal to all the expences of freight and commission, risque or insurance, &amp;c. necessarily charged by the merchant, and the case is the same with the workmen in every other mechanic art. Hence it is that arti|sans live better and more easily in America than in Europe, and such as are good oeconomists, make a comfortable provision for age, and for their children.&mdash;Such may therefore remove with advantage to America.</P>
<P>In the old long settled countries of Europe all arts, trades, professions, farms, &amp;c. are so full, that it is difficult for a poor man, who has children, to place them where they may gain or learn to gain a decent livelihood. The artisans who fear creating future rivals in business, refuse to take apprentices, but upon conditions of money, maintenance, and the like, which the parents are unable to comply with. Hence the youth are brought up in ignorance of every gainful art, and are obliged to become soldiers, or servants, or thieves, for a subsistence. In America, the rapid increase of inhabitants takes away that fear of rivalship, and artisans willingly receive apprentices, from the hope of profit by their labour during the remainder of the time stipulated after they shall be instructed. Hence it is easy for poor families to get their children instruct|ed, for the artisans are so desirous of apprentices, that many

of them will even give money to the parents, to have boys from ten to fifteen years of age bound apprentices to them till the age of twenty-one; and many poor parents have by that means, on their arrival in the country, raised money enough to buy land sufficient to establish themselves, and to subsist the rest of their family by agriculture. &mdash; These contracts for apprentices are made before a magistrate who regulates the agreement, according to reason and justice, and having in view the formation of a future useful citizen, obliges the master to engage by a written indenture, not only that during the time of service stipulated, the apprentice shall be duly pro|vided with meat, drink, apparel, washing and lodging, and at its expiration with a complete new suit of cloaths, but also that he shall be taught to read, write and cast accompts, and that he shall be well instructed in the art or profession of his master, by which he may afterwards gain a livelihood, and be able in his turn to raise a family. A copy of this indenture is given the apprentice, or his friends, and the magistrate keeps a record of it, to which recourse may be had in case of failure, by the master, in any point of performance.</P>
<P>This desire among masters to have more hands employed in working for them, induces them to pay the passages of young persons of both sexes, who on their arrival agree to serve them two three, or four years; those who have already learnt a trade, agreeing for a shorter term, in proportion to their skill,

and the consequent immediate value of their service; and those who have none, agreeing for a longer term, in consideration of being taught an art their poverty would not permit them to acquire in their own country.</P>
<P>The almost general mediocrity of fortune that prevails in America, obliging its people to follow some business for sub|sistence, those vices that arise generally from idleness, are in a great measure prevented. Industry and constant employ|ment, are great preservations of the morals and virtue of a nation. Hence bad examples to youth are more rare in America, which must be a comfortable consideration to pa|rents. To this may be truly added, that serious religion, under its various denominations, is not only tolerated, but respected and practised. Atheism is unknown there, infidelity rare and secret; so that persons may live to a great age in that country, without having their piety shocked by meeting either an atheist or an infidel. And the Divine Being seems to have manifested his approbation of the mutual forbearance and kindness, with which the different sects treat each other, by the remarkable prosperity with which he has been pleased to favour the whole country.</P>
