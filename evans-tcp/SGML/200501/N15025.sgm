<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a survey of Mankind in general, and of the several requi|sites by which life is rendered comfortable and desirable, the productions of the Vege|table Kingdom are amongst the foremost; as affording the principal necessaries, conveni|encies, and luxuries of life.</P>
<P>It is in this view, that the Science of Botany, or that branch of natural History which teaches the right knowledge of Vegetables, and their application to the most beneficial uses, is an object which not only merits the attention and encouragement of every patriotic and liberal mind, but undoubtedly deserves a place amongst the first of useful pursuits. That it is an object highly deserving the at|tention of Mankind in general, cannot be denied; but in a particular manner of the inhabitants of this Commonwealth, the author wishes to make appear more obvious.</P>
<P>Those who are conversant in trade well know the continual enormous expence we are at in purchasing foreign Teas, Drugs, Dye-stuffs, &amp;c. The diminution of this, ought to be the care and concern of every friend to his Coun|try's welfare. And we presume it will appear evident, that the most eligible and obvious 
<PB N="vi" REF="019068_0004_0FAA0DE8751D4E28">
means of obtaining this desirable object, will be by a proper attention and application to Horticulture and Botany. In this view, the following considerations more particularly present themselves.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The introduction and cultivation of foreign useful and valuable plants.</HI> Our extent of ter|ritory, our diversity of Climate, of Soil, and of Stuation, leaves not a doubt but that we might introduce and cultivate to advantage, many of the same articles, whose importation at this time, is to us, a considerable expence. The <HI>Thea viridis &amp; bohea,</HI> the true green and bohea Tea plant, formerly accounted different species, but now known to be the same, and one of the greatest drainers of our wealth; may be procured either from its native place of growth, or from Europe where it has be|come pretty common; and we have every rea|son to believe, from its being the spontaneous produce of the same parallel of latitude, and from other considerations respecting its na|tural history, that it might thrive well in our Southern States. In this same view the Vine, the Almond Tree, Fig Tree, Liquorice, Mad|der and Rhubarb, deservedly require our atten|tion. Many other <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. I. Page 155.</NOTE> foreign useful plants might be enumerated, and the advantages that may be derived to this Commonwealth from their introduction, encrease and culture, must appear sufficiently obvious.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="vii" REF="019068_0005_0FAA0DE881AF7CF0">
II. <HI>The discovering the qualities and uses of our own native Vegetable productions, and applying them to the most useful purposes.</HI> Our extent of luxuriant unexplored territory, is an object which here in a particular manner occurs re|plete with promising advantages. Our being able to discover a plant of equal general usage with the <HI>Potatoe, Tobacco,</HI> or <HI>Ginseng;</HI> or good substitutes for <HI>Tea, Coffee</HI> and <HI>Peruvian Bark;</HI> would be advantages surpassing all adequate estimation.</P>
<P>It is true, we may gain by tedious experi|ence, or stumble by chance upon many useful discoveries respecting the uses and medicinal virtues of plants, but it is from our observa|tions and researches founded upon, and di|rected by, a <HI>knowledge of Botany,</HI> that we can alone hope for certain success. From the writings of the celebrated LINNAEUS this gene|ral rule is sufficiently established; that plants of the same habit and appearance, and those which agree in the disposition of their flowers and fruit, have likewise similar virtues and properties. From this observation we deduce an obvious inference; that the more general knowledge we obtain of the characters and appearance of plants, the more likely we shall be also to encrease our knowledge of their vir|tues, qualities and uses.</P>
<P>This subject has been much urged and long dwelt upon from a conviction of its impor|tance and promising advantages: the author, influenced by these considerations, and from 
<PB N="viii" REF="019068_0006_0FAA0DE94601DF50">
a belief that it might contribute in some de|gree to render a knowledge of this subject more familiar and easy, has been induced to draw up this Alphabetical Catalogue of the Forest Trees and Shrubs, natives of the Ame|rican United States, as mentioned by the best authors, or since discovered by ingenious tra|vellers. In this Catalogue are contained their Linnaean Generic and trivial names, (or new formed ones where these have been wanting) together with their most common and approv|ed English ones; the particular distinguishing characters of each Genus; a plain and fami|liar description of the appearance, manner of growth, &amp;c. of their several species and va|rieties; and also, some hints of their native soil and situation, uses in Medicine, as Dyes and in domestic oeconomy.</P>
<P>As terms peculiar to the science frequently and unavoidably occur, it was judged neces|sary, in order to render the work more useful and complete, to prefix a general explanation of the Linnaean system of arrangement, as also of the useful and unavoidable scientific terms; for this and other purposes the author has availed himself from the best writers, of what has been judged most applicable and conducive to his design. The whole forming an useful <HI>Vademecum Botanicum,</HI> or Botanical Companion.</P>
<P>In this my <HI>Countrymen</HI> are presented at one view with a concise description of their own native Forest Trees and Shrubs, as far as hi|therto discovered. And those whose fancy 
<PB N="ix" REF="019068_0007_0FAA0DEA0BF38A30">
may lead to this delightful science, may by a little application, from hence be enabled scien|tifically to examine and arrange, not only those of the shrubby, but the several and various species of the herbaceous class. The <HI>foreigner,</HI> curious in American collections, will be here|by better enabled to make a selection suitable to his own particular fancy. If he wishes to cultivate timber for oeconomical purposes, he is here informed of our valuable Forest Trees: if for adorning his plantation or garden of our different ornamental flowering shrubs.</P>
<P>The author would have been happy, could he have given also a descriptive Catalogue of our native herbaceous plants. At present, circumstances oblige him to confine himself to Forest Trees and Shrubs; however he has such a work in contemplation should this meet with the encouragement of the public.</P>
<P>He is well aware that many improvements might have been made, with regard to the form and manner of description, as well as by the addition of Synonyms, Notes of re|ference, &amp;c. but, upon reflecting that the ge|nerality of his Readers would have been more embarrassed and confused than profited there|by, he was determined to use the most plain and familiar method and language, in order to render the work as generally useful as possi|ble; this being the chief end and design of the undertaking.</P>

<HEAD>An Explanation of the different parts of Fructification.</HEAD>
<P>FRUCTIFICATION is a temporary part of vegetables, appointed for the purpose of generation, terminating the old vegetable and beginning the new. The parts of fruc|tification are the seven following, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Calyx,</HI> flower-cup, or empalement.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Corolla,</HI> petals, or painted leaves of the flower.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Stamina,</HI> threads, or chives.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Pistilum,</HI> or pointal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>Pericarpium,</HI> or Seed-vessel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The <HI>Seeds.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The <HI>Receptacle,</HI> or base on which all the other parts of the fructification are connected.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>calyx</HI> (which is the termination of the outer bark of the plant, presenting itself in the fructification, in this form) comprehends the seven following species, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>perianthium,</HI> the <HI>involucrum,</HI> the <HI>amentum,</HI> the <HI>spadix,</HI> the <HI>glu|ma,</HI> the <HI>calyptra,</HI> and <HI>volva,</HI> of each of which in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>perianthium,</HI> the flower-cup or empalement properly so called, is the most common species of calyx, and situated close to the fructification. If it encloses the <HI>stamina</HI> and <HI>germen,</HI> it is called the <HI>perianthium</HI> of the fructification. If it encloses the <HI>Stamina</HI> and not the <HI>germen,</HI> it is the <HI>perianthium</HI> of the flower. If it includes the <HI>germem,</HI> and not the <HI>sta|mina,</HI> it is the <HI>perianthium</HI> of the fruit.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>involucrum</HI> or cover is situated at the bottom of an um|bel, at some distance from the flower. It is called an univer|sal <HI>involucrum</HI> or cover, if it is situated at the bottom of an universal umbel; and a partial <HI>involucrum</HI> or cover, if at the foot of a partial umbel.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>amentum</HI> or katkin is that sort of calyx, which consists of a great number of chaffy scales proceeding from a common receptacle or slender thread, as in hazel, alder, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>spatha</HI> or sheath is a sort of calyx which bursts length|ways, and puts forth a stalk supporting the flowers; as in <HI>narcissus,</HI> snow-drop, <HI>arum,</HI> indian turnep &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>gluma</HI> or chaffy husk, is that sort of calyx peculiar to grasses, composed of thin scales or valves, which are often terminated by an <HI>arista,</HI> a beard, or awn.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>calyptra</HI> a veil or hood, is a sort of calyx peculiar to 
<PB N="xvi" REF="019068_0014_0FAA0DF0C09D0F08">
mosses, placed over their <HI>antherae,</HI> and resembling a monk's cowl, or rather an extinguisher.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>volva</HI> is a sort of calyx peculiar to the <HI>fungi</HI> or mush|room tribe, involving or inclosing their fructification. It is membranaceous and torn quite round.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>corolla,</HI> literally a wreath or garland, (serving together with the calyx as covers to the parts they inclose) is the termination of the inner bark of the plant presenting itself in this form, and consists of the <HI>petalum</HI> and <HI>nectarium.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>petalum</HI> or petal is the corrollaceous covering of the flower. If the flower is monopetalous, <HI>i. e.</HI> consists of one petal, the lower hollow part of such a <HI>corolla</HI> is called <HI>tubus,</HI> the tube, and the upper part which spreads wider is called <HI>limbus,</HI> the limb or border. And from its different figure it is called either,</P>
<P><HI>Bell-shaped,</HI> without any tube below,</P>
<P><HI>Funnel-shaped</HI> or conical, with a tube,</P>
<P><HI>Saucer</HI> or <HI>salver-shaped,</HI> with a tube,</P>
<P><HI>Wheel shaped,</HI> without any tube below; or</P>
<P><HI>Gaping,</HI> lipped or masked.</P>
<P>If the <HI>corrolla</HI> be polypetalous, <HI>i. e.</HI> consists of many petals, the lower part of each petal is called, the <HI>unguls,</HI> or claw.</P>
<P>And the upper part which is wider, is called the <HI>lamina,</HI> or thin plate.</P>
<P>Again this upper part or <HI>lamina,</HI> is either</P>
<P><HI>Cross-shaped,</HI> of four equal spreading petals; or</P>
<P><HI>Butter-fly-shaped,</HI> irregular and of four petals; the upper one of which is called the <HI>standard;</HI> the two side ones <HI>wings;</HI> and the under one the <HI>keel.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>nectarium</HI> is that part of the corolla which contains the honey; having a wonderful variety both as to shape and situation, and is sometimes united with the petals, and some|times separate from them.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>stamina</HI> are those parts of a flower appropriated to the preparation of the <HI>pollen,</HI> or fecundating dust, and con|sist of the <HI>filamentum,</HI> the <HI>anthera,</HI> and the <HI>pollen.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>filamentum,</HI> the filament or thread serves to elevate the <HI>antherae,</HI> and connect it to the flower.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>anthera,</HI> or summit of the <HI>stamen,</HI> is that part which contains the <HI>pollen</HI> or fecundating dust, and discharges it when ripe.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>pollen,</HI> or impregnating dust, is that fine powder con|tained within the <HI>antherae,</HI> or tops of the stamina, and dis|persed when ripe, upon the female organ, for impregnating the same.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="xvii" REF="019068_0015_0FAA0DF1A34655A0">
IV. The <HI>pistillum,</HI> pointal, or female organ, adheres to the fruit, and is that part appropriated for the reception of the <HI>pollen,</HI> spoken of above. It consists of the <HI>germen,</HI> the <HI>stylus,</HI> and the <HI>stigma.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>germen,</HI> or seed-bud, is the base or lower part of the <HI>pistillum,</HI> containing the rudiments of the unripe fruit, or seed, in the flowering state of the plant,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>stylus,</HI> or style, is that part of the <HI>pistillum</HI> which stands upon the <HI>germen,</HI> and elevates the <HI>stigma</HI> or summit.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>stigma,</HI> the summit, or top of the style, is that part which receives the fertilizing dust of the <HI>antherae,</HI> and trans|mits its <HI>effluvia,</HI> through the style into the middle of the <HI>germen,</HI> or seed-bud.</P>
<P N="5">V. The <HI>pericarpium,</HI> or seed vessel, is that part which contains the seeds, and discharges them when ripe. It comprehends the eight following species, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>capsula,</HI> the <HI>siliqua,</HI> the <HI>legumen,</HI> the <HI>conceptaculum</HI> or <HI>folliculus,</HI> the <HI>drupa,</HI> the <HI>pomum,</HI> the <HI>bacca,</HI> and the <HI>strobilus;</HI> of each of which in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>capsula,</HI> a capsule or little casket, is a dry hollow seed|vessel, that splits or opens in some determinate manner. Capsules, when opened or split, are divided outwardly into one or more pieces, called <HI>valvulae,</HI> or valves, the parts which divide the capsules internally into cells are called <HI>dissepimenta,</HI> or partitions. And the substances which con|nect the partitions to the seeds, are called <HI>columellae,</HI> or little|pillars. The empty spaces for containing the seeds, are called <HI>loculamenta,</HI> or cells.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>siliqua,</HI> or pod is a seed-vessel with two valves, having the seeds fixed along the joining or edge of both valves.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>legumen,</HI> or cod, is a seed-vessel with two valves, having the seeds fixed along the edge of one of the valves only.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>conceptaculum,</HI> a receiver; or <HI>folliculus,</HI> a little bag, is a seed-vessel with one valve, splitting length-ways from top to bottom, and has no seam for fastening the seeds with|in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>drupa,</HI> drupe, or stone fruit, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve, or external opening, and contains with|in it a stone or nut.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>pomum,</HI> or apple, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve or external opening, and contains within it a capsule.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>bacca,</HI> or berry, is a pulpy seed-vessel, which has no valve, and contains seeds which are naked, or have no other covering than the pulp.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="xviii" REF="019068_0016_0FAA0DF245D1D670">
8. The <HI>strobilus,</HI> or cone, is a seed-vessel composed of woody scales, laid over one another like tiles; it opens only at top, the scales being fixed below to the center of the cone.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Semen,</HI> the seed, is a deciduous part of the plant, con|taining the rudiments of a new vegetable, and fertilized by the sprinkling of the male dust. Under this head are com|prehended the seed properly so called, the <HI>nut</HI> and <HI>propago.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>nut</HI> is a seed covered with a hard bony skin.</P>
<P><HI>Propago,</HI> the seed of the mosses, which has no tunic or covering.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>receptaculum,</HI> or receptacle, the seventh and last part of the fructification on which the other six are connected, comprehends the <HI>receptaculum proprium,</HI> the <HI>receptaculum com|mune,</HI> and the <HI>spadix.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>receptaculum proprium,</HI> or proper receptacle, which be|longs to the parts of a single fructification only. It is called the receptacle either of the <HI>fructification,</HI> when it is com|mon to both flower and fruit; of the <HI>flower,</HI> when the parts of the flower only are fastened to it without the <HI>ger|men;</HI> of the <HI>fruit</HI> when it is a base for the fruit, and at a di|stance from the receptacle of the flower; or of the <HI>seeds,</HI> when it is a base to which the seeds are fixed within the <HI>pericarpium</HI> or seed-vessel.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>receptaculum commune,</HI> or common receptacle, is that which connects several florets together; as in compound flowers; and is either <HI>paleaceum</HI> chaffy, <HI>i. e.</HI> with thin membranaceous chaffy plates rising between the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">orets, or <HI>nudum</HI> naked, without chaffy plates.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>spadix</HI> is the receptacle of the palms, and is always branched. It is also used to signify the flower stalk of every plant, which was originally contained within a <HI>spatha</HI> or sheath; but in this last case it is often simple.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="explanation">
<HEAD>Explanation of the Modes of Flowering.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>peduncle</HI> or foot-stalk of the flower is a partial trunk, bear|ing the fructification only, but not the leaves.</P>
<P>When branched or divided, each of the divisions is called <HI>pedicellus,</HI> or a little flower-stalk.</P>
<P>Flower-stalks are distinguished from the place of the plant where they grow, into,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>radical</HI> flower-stalk, when they proceed immediately from the root.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>cauline</HI> flower-stalk, which proceeds from the stem.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="xix" REF="019068_0017_0FAA0DF333604478">
3. The <HI>branch</HI> peduncle, which proceeds from the branches.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>axillary,</HI> or bosom flower-stalk, which comes out be|tween the leaf and stem, or between the branch and stem.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>terminal</HI> flower-stalk, which comes from the extremity of the branch or stem.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Solitary</HI> peduncle, when there is only one in the same place.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Scattered</HI> peduncles, when a great many grow together without any order.</P>
<P>Flower-stalks are also distinguished from the different modes in which flowers are borne and connected on them, into the <HI>uniflorous, biflorous, triflorous,</HI> or <HI>multiflorous</HI> peduncle, that is, which bear one, two, three, or many flowers.</P>
<P>Flowers are also collected or borne in the ten following modes.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fasciculus,</HI> a bunch or bundle, when peduncles are erect, parallel, placed close to one another, and all of the same height, as in <HI>sweet-william.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>capitulum,</HI> a little head, where many flowers are collect|ed into a head, at the extremity of a peduncle, as in <HI>globe amaronthus.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>spike,</HI> where the flowers sit close without foot-stalks, and are placed along a common flower-stalk. A spike is called <HI>secunda,</HI> single ranked, when all the flowers are turned to one side; or <HI>dislicha,</HI> double ranked, when the flow|ers look to both sides, or stand two ways.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>corymbus,</HI> where the lesser flower-stalks of unequal lengths are produced along the common peduncle on all sides, and rise to the same height, so as to form a flat or even surface at top, as in <HI>spiraea opulifolia.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>panicle</HI> where the fructifications are dispersed upon foot-stalks variously subdivided, as in oats, &amp;c. a panicle is said to be <HI>diffuse</HI> when the partial foot-stalks diverge, and the fructifications hang loose; or <HI>straight</HI> and narrow; when the foot-stalks approach near to one another.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>thyrsus</HI> is a panicle contracted into an oval or egg|shaped-form, somewhat resembling the cone of a pine; as in <HI>lilac, horse chesnut,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>racemus</HI> or cluster, consists of a common peduncle, having short lateral branches, all nearly of equal length proceeding from it; as in the <HI>vine, currants</HI> &amp;c. It is called <HI>racemus secundus,</HI> or a one ranked cluster when all the foot-stalks incline to one side; as in the <HI>sorrel-tree</HI> and most of our <HI>andromedas.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="xx" REF="019068_0018_0FAA0DF3CC0C3698">
8. The <HI>verticillus,</HI> or whorl, where the flowers are produced in rings at each joint of the stem, with very short foot|stalks; as in <HI>mint, horehound,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>umbella</HI> or umbel, where a number of small flower|stalks rise from the same center to an equal height and form an even surface at top. It is called a <HI>simple umbel,</HI> when the flower-stalks are simple or undivided; and a <HI>compound umbel,</HI> or sometimes an <HI>universal umbel,</HI> when all the foot-stalks are subdivided into smaller umbels, commonly called <HI>partial umbels</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. The <HI>cyma,</HI> or irregular umbel, where the foot-stalks rise from a common center, and to an equal height, as in the umbel; but the secondary or partial foot-stalks are irregularly dispersed, without order as in <HI>elder, viburnum</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">&sect; <HI>The Reader is requested to observe that the names of the Species, under which the words,</HI> Bartram's Catalogue <HI>immediately occur, are not found in Linnaeus's Species Plantarum, but are taken from a Sheet Catalogue published by John and William Bartram, Botanists in Kingsessing; containing the names of Forest Trees and Shrubs, growing in, or near their Garden.</HI></NOTE>

<P>IT hath Hermaphrodite and Male flowers upon the same tree.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Hermaphrodite,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Empalement</HI> is of one leaf, five cleft, acute, coloured, plain and entire at the base, and permanent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Corolla</HI> consists of five petals, which are ovate, broader outward, obtuse, scarce larger than the calyx, and spreading.</P>

<HI>The</HI> Species <HI>with us are,</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>1. ACER pennsylvanicum&mdash;Pennsylvanian Dwarf Mountain Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally upon the mountains in the back parts of Pennsylvania. The stems are slender, rising to the height of six or eight feet, and sending off several opposite branches. The leaves are three|pointed, pretty much sawed on their edges, and placed opposite upon pretty long footstalks. The flowers terminate the stalks in a pretty long erect <HI>racemus</HI> or bunch; they are small, of an herbaceous colour, and in part succeeded by small conjoined winged seeds.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>2. ACER glaucum. The Silver-leaved Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This tree grows frequently to the height of fifty or sixty feet, with many spreading branches. The leaves are five-lobed, somewhat toothed, or deeply and irregularly sawed on their edges: they are of a lucid green on the upper side and a bright silver co|lour on their under. The flowers are produced in little umbels at the foot of the leaves; they are of a deep red colour, and are succeeded by large winged seeds, which fall off early in the summer. This is perhaps the Acer rubrum of Linnaeus.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>3. ACER Negundo. The Ash-leaved Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This tree is dioecious, or having male and female flowers upon different trees; it is but of middling growth, rising perhaps to the height of twenty or thirty feet. The leaves something resemble those of the Ash, but are generally trifoliate or quinquefoliate, or consisting of three or five lobes; which are oval, somewhat pointed, and a little notched towards their extremities. The flowers of the male are produced 
<PB N="3" REF="019068_0021_0FAA0DF5FB81B038">
upon pendulous bundles of very long fine threads or footstalks, each having a small flower-cup at its ex|tremity, containing five or more stamina. The female produces flowers at the extremity of the small branch|es, in long loose bunches; they have long footstalks, with a small deciduous empalement; containing a compressed germen, with scarce any style, but two reflexed stigmas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>4. ACER canadense. American striped Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This is but of middling growth. The bark, especially of the young shoots, is beautifully variegated or strip|ed. The leaves are divided into three very sharp pointed lobes, and very finely sawed on their edges. The flowers are produced in solitary bunches, with shortish footstalks; having pretty large petals and empalements, containing generally eight stamina or filaments; and in hermaphrodite flowers two reflexed stigmas. The flowers and seeds are of a greenish yellow colour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>5. ACER rubrum. The Scarlet flowering Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This grows to a pretty large size in a rich soil. The leaves are three and sometimes nearly five lobed, and sawed on their edges. The flowers are produced in little umbels closely surrounding the small branches, and are of a scarlet colour. The footstalks of the hermaphrodite flowers, shoot out to a considerable length; they are of a scarlet colour, each sustaining two joined winged seeds, somewhat of the same co|lour. There is a variety of this with yellowish flow|ers and seeds, which is, I believe, the most common kind in Pennsylvania.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<PB N="4" REF="019068_0022_0FAA0DF6C4FF2CC0">
<HEAD>6. ACER saccharum. The Sugar Maple.</HEAD>
<P>This grows to a large tree of two feet or more in diameter, and fifty or sixty feet high. The leaves something resemble the Silver-leaved Maple, but are not so large, nor deeply lobed; or of so fine a silver colour. It flowers in manner of the Scarlet Maple, but the flowers are of an herbaceous colour; and produces large joined winged seeds. The back in|habitants make a pretty good sugar, and in consider|able quantity, of the sap of this and the Silver-leaved Maple; and though these have generally been pre|ferred, yet all our Maples yield a sap which affords a pretty good sugar.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>2. AESCULUS Pavia. Scarlet flowering Horse|Chesnut.</HEAD>
<P>This is but of humble growth, seldom rising to more than ten or twelve feet high; sending out seve|ral branches, with leaves and flowers much like the former, except the flowers being of a bright red colour: they stand upon short naked footstalks, branching from the common stem, generally five or six together in each <HI>thyrsus.</HI> They are tubulous at bottom but spread open at top, where the petals are irregular in size and length, having something the appearance of a lip flower; they have seven or eight stamina the length of the petals.

This newly discovered, rare, and elegant flowering shrub, was first observed by John Bartram when on botanical researches, on the Alatamaha river in Georgia, Anno 1760; but was not brought into Pennsylvania till about fifteen years after, when his son William Bartram, employed in the like pursuits, revisited the place where it had been before observed, and had the pleasing prospect of beholding it in its native soil, possessed with all its floral charms; and bearing ripe seeds at the same time; some of which he collected and brought home, and raised several plants therefrom, which in four years time flowered, and in one year after perfected ripe seeds.</P>
<P>It seems nearly allied to the Gordonia, to which it has, in some late Catalogues, been joined; but William Bartram, who first introduced it, believing it to be a new Genus, has chosen to honour it with the name of that patron of sciences, and truly great

and distinguished character, Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The trivial name is added from the river, where alone it has been observed to grow naturally. It delights in a loose, sandy and moist soil.</P>

<HEAD>1. ILEX Aquifolium. American Common Holly.</HEAD>
<P>This grows in Maryland, New Jersey, &amp;c. gene|rally in moist ground, rising to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, with an erect stem, covered with a greyish coloured smooth bark, and furnished with pretty many branches, which are garnished with thick, hard, ever-green leaves, waved on their edges and indented, each point terminating in a stiff prick|ly spine. The flowers are produced upon pretty long footstalks, often three parted from the sides of the branches, of a white colour, having often five or six stamina, and the corolla divided into as many parts, and are succeeded by roundish berries, which when full ripe are red. Of the bark of common Holly is made Birdlime, which is better than that made of Milletoe.</P>

<HEAD>LIRIODENDRUM Tulipifera. Virginian Tulip-Tree.</HEAD>
<P>This often grows to the size of a large tree, of seventy or eighty feet in height and above four feet in diameter. The bark of young trees is smooth, but as they grow old it becomes furrowed, their lower branches also falling off. The young trees send off many branches, almost from the ground upward, garnished with broad smooth leaves, heart|shaped at the base, but end-bitten, or cut, at the ex|tremity, having two or three pointed lobes, on each side the midrib; of a dark green colour on the upper

side, but lighter and veined underneath; with pretty long footstalks. The flowers are produced at the extremity of the branches in form of a Tulip, com|posed of six or seven petals, or sometimes more, greenish coloured towards the tops, but marked transversely with red, towards the claws; which are glandular and honey-bearing. The young trees make a beautiful appearance, especially when in flow|er. We have two kinds of Tulip trees, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Yellow and White, their difference easily distinguishable by the wood or timber, but perhaps not otherwise. The Yellow is soft and brittle, and much used for boards, heels for shoes, &amp;c. also turned into bowls, trench|ers, &amp;c. The white is heavy, tough, and hard, and likewise sawed into joists, boards, &amp;c. for building. The bark of the root is used as an ingredient in bitters, &amp;c.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>2. PRINOS verticillatus. Virginian Winter|Berry.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally in moist places, by streams of water; generally sending up several slender stalks to the height of eight or ten feet, dividing into a few branches towards the top. The leaves are lance|shaped, sharp pointed, and acutely sawed on their edges; having short slender footstalks, and placed alternately. The flowers come out at the bosom of the leaves in small Corymbi or Clusters; of an her|baceous colour. They are succeeded by roundish berries of a red colour when ripe, and remaining long on the branches, almost surrounding them in places and somewhat resembling a whorl.</P>
<P>Note, The inner bark of this shrub is very good to make poultices of for ripening tumors.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>1. QUERCUS alba. Common American White Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows very common, and with age arrives to the size of a large tree of seventy or eighty feet in height, and of three, four, five, or more feet in diameter; dividing into many large branches, and covered with a whitish scaly bark. The leaves are narrowed towards the base, but spreading and deeply sinuated obliquely, towards the ends; the sinuses ob|tuse, the angles, or productions unequal in length, entire and obtuse. They are of a glaucous, or light green underneath and have very short footstalks. The acorns are middling sized, sitting in small shal|low cups. There are some varieties of this, differing in the hardness and toughness of the timber, and somewhat in their acorns or fruit. It affords a hard, tough, useful and valuable timber, which is hewed into beams, &amp;c. for frame buildings; sawed into plank, &amp;c. for ship building; and applied to various other useful purposes. Our swine are often wholly fatted upon the several kinds of acorns, but for these and Chesnut Oak they seek most diligently.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<PB N="120" REF="019068_0138_0FAA0DB3F95B49E0">
<HEAD>2. QUERCUS alba minor. Barren White Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows generally upon poor, barren, or waste land, rising perhaps to the height of thirty or forty feet, covered with scaly greyish bark. The leaves are somewhat rough, but of a shining green above, somewhat paler underneath; they are sinuated deep|ly, most obtusely, and irregularly; the lobes or pro|ductions. (if I may be allowed the expression) are obtuse, often somewhat angular, and very irregular. The acorns are small and striped. The timber is ac|counted very durable for posts, to set in the earth; otherwise not much esteemed unless for fuel.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>3. QUERCUS alba palustris. Swamp White Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This becomes a pretty large spreading tree, of two or three feet in diameter and of proportionable height. The bark is often rougher or more furrowed than the other kinds, and greyish coloured. The leaves are somewhat wedge-shaped or narrowed towards the base, and toothed on their edges and extremities. The acorns are larger and rounder than those of the common White Oak, and have larger and thicker cups, supported often by pairs upon a long, strong footstalk.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>Quercus nigra. Black Oak.</HEAD>
<HEAD>4. QUERCUS nigra. Common Pennsylvanian Black Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows to the height of sixty or seventy feet, and to three or four feet in diameter, with large spreading branches. The leaves are large, spread|ing, and somewhat woolly; their footstalks longer than those of the White Oak. They are irregular|ly
<PB N="121" REF="019068_0139_0FAA0DB5A1E1E788">
and sometimes pretty deeply sinuated, the angles or productions unequal, generally obtuse, yet with their veins extending in a bristly point. The acorns are roundish and not large, sitting in thick scaly cups. There is, I think, a variety of this of much smaller growth, with larger leaves and different somewhat in the fruit. Our common Black Oak is used much (where Cedar is scarce) for making shingles, and also for rails, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>5. QUERCUS nigra digituta. Finger-leaved Black Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally in low lands, rising to the height of thirty or forty feet, with a trunk of con|siderable thickness, covered with a rough blackish bark. The leaves are sinuated, or divided towards their extremities into two or three pretty long, some|what finger-shaped lobes, of unequal length, with others shorter, sometimes at the sides; all of which end in a bristly point. The acorns are small, but the cups pretty large.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>6. QUERCUS nigra trifida. Maryland Black Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally in Maryland, and other low lands, with a trunk of eighteen inches or two feet in diameter, and thirty or forty feet in height. The leaves are wedge-shaped, or narrowed towards the base, and three-pointed, with bristly terminations. The acorns and cups resemble the last mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>8. QUERCUS nigra pumila. Dwarf Black Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally upon poor barren ridges, rising to the height of five or six feet, with a crook|ed, branching stem. The leaves are about three pointed, much resembling those of the Maryland Black Oak. The acorns are small, and stand in small shallow cups. This, I believe, is of little use or beauty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>Quercus rubra. Red Oak.</HEAD>
<HEAD>9. QUERCUS rubra maxima. Largest Red Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This often becomes a large tree, of the height of seventy or eighty feet and of four, five, or sometimes six feet in diameter; retaining its thickness to a con|siderable height, and without lateral branches, but spreading at the top. The leaves are large, obtuse|ly and but lightly sinuated, the angles acute, each often terminating with several acute, bristly points. The acorns are large and somewhat conical, sitting in broad shallow cups. The timber is used for staves, shingles, rails, &amp;c.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>10. QUERCUS rubra ramosislima. Water Red Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows most naturally by creek sides, or in low wet places, rising to the height of a pretty large tree; generally thick set with slender lateral branches, and covered with somewhat smooth, greyish colour|ed bark. The leaves are small, obtusely and deep|ly
<PB N="123" REF="019068_0141_0FAA0DB7CC2E0EA8">
sinuated, pretty uniformly, almost to the midrib; the angles or lobes are narrow, acute, and unequal, each terminating with several bristly points. The acorns and cups are small.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>11. QUERCUS rubra montana. Upland Red Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally upon higher and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> land than the others, often attaining to fifty or sixty feet in height. The bark is somewhat rough and light|ish coloured. The leaves are deeply and obtusely sinuated, somewhat regularly; the angles somewhat bitrifid, or ending in several acute, bristly points; their footstalks are pretty long. The acorns and cups are middling sized. The timber is generally worm eaten, or rotten at heart, therefore of little esteem. It is likewise commonly known by the name of Spanish Oak; and, I think, has some va|rieties differing in the size of their fruit and leaves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>12. QUERCUS rubra nana. Dwarf Barren Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally upon dry barren ridges, and is found from five to ten feet high, generally grow|ing very crooked. The leaves are smaller, but some|what resemble those last described. The acorns and cups are small, the acorns red at the base and strip|ed when taken first from their cups. It is called barren from its place of growth, but is generally al|most covered with fruit, sitting very close on all sides of the branches.</P>

The timber is hard, tough and coarse grained.</P>

Quercus Prinus. <HI>Chesnut-leaved Oak.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>16. QUERCUS Prinus. Chesnut-leaved Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This grows naturally upon a light gravelly soil, frequently to forty feet or more in height, and above two feet in diameter; covered with a furrowed, lightish coloured bark. The leaves are somewhat oval and uniformly crenated on their edges, or ra|ther sometimes obtusely toothed. The acorns are smooth and large, greenish coloured and sitting in shallow spreading cups. The timber somewhat ap|proaches towards that of Chesnut in appearance, but affords very good fuel, rails, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="species">
<HEAD>17. QUERCUS Prinus humilis. Dwarf Ches|nut or Chinquepin Oak.</HEAD>
<P>This generally rises with several shrubby, spread|ing stalks, to the height of two or three feet. The leaves are somewhat wedge-shaped and toothed, or slightly and obliquely sinuated. The acorns and cups pretty much resemble those of the large kind, but are considerably smaller.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to make some re|marks with respect to cutting, or felling of timber. Long experience, I think, hath sufficiently ascertain|ed, that timber cut down in the spring of the year, when full of sap, and the leaves fully expanded; and also in the third or last quarter of the moon's age; is much more durable than when cut at any other time. Timber when full of sap and vigour, in all probability, contains also more oily particles, which, in proportion as they abound, are known to add to its durability. With regard to the influence of the moon, it may probably be accounted a super|stitious
<PB N="126" REF="019068_0144_0FAA0DBA2BB967B8">
or whimsical fancy, but that it materially af|fects timber is a fact well known to those who strip, or; peel bark for the use of tanners; and when ac|counted for in one case, may probably throw some light upon the other. But further, it is also a fact well known, that timber, whose bark has been suffi|ciently separated and peeled round at the but, in or|der for deading, as it is termed; if done in the de|crease of the moon, retains its greenness often a con|siderable time; but if in the increase, withers in a much shorter time. From hence, I think, we may conclude, that the sap or juice of trees, has a kind of monthly circulation, or revolution; ascending in the moon's decrease, but descending in the increase. However, be this as it may, the falling of timber in the different phasis of the moon, is considently as|serted, from experience, to materially affect its du|rability.</P>

<HEAD>XANTHORHIZA simplicissima. Shurb Yellow Root.</HEAD>
<P>This is a small shrub, growing naturally in Caro|lina. The roots are slender and cylindrical, but sending off side shoots by which it spreads much; the wood of which, together with that of the stems, are of a bright yellow colour. The stems are slender, rising to the height of two feet or more, generally simple, or without branches, and covered with a lightish brown bark. The leaves are compound, consisting of two pair of opposite lobes, terminated by an odd one; the lobes are much and deeply cut or cleft on their edges, (somewhat in form of Gar|den Lovage) and joined to very long, common foot|stalks, coming out from the tops of the stems. The flowers are produced at the top of the former year's growth, in a compound or panicled <HI>racemus;</HI> having their partial footstalks generally three flowered; they
<PB N="169" REF="019068_0187_0FAA0DDF788FC838">
are small and purplish coloured, and are succeeded by little heads of small, compressed capsules, each enclosing one small seed. The flowers on the par|tial or small footstalks, are not produced at once, those that are middle-most or terminal come out first and are hermaphrodite, and generally barren; those on the sides come out later, but one of which is generally fruitful; from whence, I had supposed, some of the flowers were female, and to the contrary of which I am not yet fully convinced.</P>
<P>This shrub, from the yellowness of its roots and stems, it is highly probable, might be employed to good purpose in dying cloaths, &amp;c. It has hitherto been undescribed by Botanical writers, though nam|ed in some late Catalogues in honour of M.
