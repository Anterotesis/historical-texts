<BIBL>PSAL. cxviii. 23.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>This is the</HI> LORD'<HI>s Doing! It is mar|velous in our Eyes!</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WITHOUT any Reference to the prime and particular View of the Words; I shall now only observe the <HI>General Truth</HI> repre|sented in them, and then apply it to the <HI>Special Occasion</HI> of the joyous Solemnity of the present Day.</P>
<P>For, the <HI>General Truth</HI> exhibited in the Text is this&mdash;that some extraordinary Events, without being properly term'd miraculous, have such lively Characters of their being the Doings of GOD, as they are evidently so to unprejudic'd and careful Observers, and appear marvellous in their pious Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005681_0006_1026BB9DA973A608">
By <HI>some extraordinary Events,</HI> I mean some remarkable Ones in the natural and moral World, even in the present Ages as well as the former, which greatly affect humane So|cieties or particular Persons, especially the People of GOD; and <HI>these Events</HI> connected with the various <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Causes</HI> leading to them.</P>
<P>By Events <HI>not properly term'd miraculous;</HI> I mean, when GOD does <HI>not appear</HI> to work on his Creatures in a Manner <HI>contrary</HI> to the <HI>usual Ways</HI> of his Working, <HI>singly</HI> in themselves consider'd.</P>
<P>And by their having <HI>such lively Characters of their being the Doings of</HI> GOD, <HI>as they are evidently so to unprejudic'd and care|ful Observers;</HI> I mean, these Characters are distinguishingly bright and legible to such qualified Persons: Or if they are inadvertent, or under a Prejudice; they are not like to see them to be the Doings of GOD, much less admire them in a pious Manner, or yield him the Glory of them. See <HI>Psal.</HI> xcii. 4,&mdash;6.</P>
<P>But to clear this Truth, we must consider these three <HI>General Heads,</HI> as&mdash;Time allows&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. In what <HI>Manner</HI> may the sovereign GOD be said to <HI>operate usually</HI> among his Creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. When have <HI>his providential Operations</HI> such lively Cha|racters of their being <HI>his Doings.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>pious Admirations</HI> they should raise up in us, and which they happily raise if we are duly disposed.</P>
<P N="1">1. In what <HI>Manner</HI> may the sovereign GOD be said to <HI>operate usually</HI> among his Creatures.</P>
<P>And here we must needs observe; that as there are <HI>three</HI> Sorts of Creatures or created Substances, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Corporeal, Spi|ritual,</HI> and <HI>Compos'd of Both;</HI> so there is a different Sort of Operation of GOD upon and among them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005681_0007_1026BB9F2EBF6070">
I. In his Operation on <HI>meerly corporeal</HI> or <HI>material Substances</HI>&mdash;He not only by his continual Influence, preserves them in their Being, Nature or essential Properties of <HI>Solidity, Ex|tension, &amp;c.</HI> which he has been pleas'd to give them; but to this Influence he also seems to add his further <HI>usual</HI> Operation in these <HI>three</HI> different Manners, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>(1) In continually causing all material Substances to <HI>incline</HI> towards each other, in regular Proportions to their Quantities and Distances: Which is commonly called the Law or Power of <HI>Attraction</HI> or Gravity.</P>
<P>(2) When they come to a certain Nearness, he by a con|trary Operation moves them, in regular Proportions also, to <HI>fly off:</HI> Which is commonly called the Law or Power of <HI>Re|pulsion;</HI> without which all material Substances on Earth wou'd soon unite in one solid Body.</P>
<P>(3) When they are forced within a certain Nearness, he by a different Operation makes them <HI>move</HI> and <HI>join</HI> together in certain Degrees of Power: Which is commonly called the Law or Power of <HI>Coboesion;</HI> without which there would be no such Thing as Union or Cohaerence in material Substances.</P>
<P>And these are called the <HI>three</HI> prime and general Laws of Nature in the material World; whereby he chiefly appears to govern it. But yet it is most evident, that he confines not himself to <HI>these:</HI> For he plainly operates in diverse other Manners on the <HI>Planets, Comets, Rays of Light;</HI> as also in the Cases of <HI>Electricity, Magnetism, Cold, Heat, &amp;c.</HI> Which are so many various Ways of his Operation, needful for the Schemes of Providence and the Blessing and Chastizing of the World.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>different Proportions</HI> of all the various Powers and Actions abovementioned, there is no doubt amazing <HI>Wis|dom;</HI> which I leave the Learned, of Leisure, to consider.</P>
<P>To which we must likewise add, that for the perfect Go|vernment of all Things here below, in a due Accommodation between the <HI>material</HI> and the <HI>moral</HI> World, for the <HI>latter</HI> of which the <HI>former</HI> is made, preserv'd and govern'd;&mdash;It is
<PB N="10" REF="005681_0008_1026BBA0C0450FB0">
doubtless needful, that the absolutely sovereign, wise and om|nipresent LORD, Proprietor, and Ruler of all, should reserve to himself the just Liberty, either <HI>mediately</HI> by brutal Animals, Men or Angels; or where their Powers are in|sufficient to answer his wise Designs, by his <HI>immediate</HI> Influence (which tho' unseen by Men may be seen by Angels) to move and order all material Substances this way or the other, as He sees best.</P>
<P>And it seems absurd to suppose, that the infinite GOD, who is absolute and all-original Life and Power, should con|stantly afford to <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> yea to the most minute <HI>Animat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> the Power of moving material Substances even contrary to the abovementioned Laws of Nature every Mo|ment; yea that he should be continually making Millions of Animals <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> such a Power as this; and yet confine himself from doing as much as they, by his <HI>immediate</HI> Power. Thus for Instance, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> affords me by a single Breath the Power of moving Millions of Atoms upwards against the Laws of Gravity: And can we imagine that this great and universal AGENT has confin'd himself from doing as much upon all Occasions, by his <HI>immediate</HI> tho' <HI>secret</HI> Influence? Or even infinitely more than this: As in raising, turning, allaying Winds and Seas, and numberless other Operations, where O|ther Powers inferiour to his are insufficient to compass his Designs.</P>
<P>So, in <HI>Scripture,</HI> the vast Varieties of Winds and Seas, of Clouds and Vapours, Snow, Fire and Rain, Cold and Heat, and other material Substances, are represented as continually directed by him, to fulfill his Pleasure. See <HI>Job</HI> xxxvi, xxxvii, xxxviii. <HI>Psalm</HI> lxv, cxlvii, cxviii, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Normay this be accounted <HI>properly miraculous</HI>&mdash;For'twould be strange indeed that the huge <HI>Leviathan</HI> should by a Power derived from Him, throw up a Cloud of Water into the Air; or even the most minute <HI>Animalculum,</HI> by the Pad of a Fin, in a Moment raise up Millions of watery Particles against the Laws of Gravity, without a Miracle: And yet for the great GOD to raise up a single Atom by his <HI>imme|diate</HI> Power, should be esteemed a Miracle. And as long as these are the <HI>usual,</HI> tho' the <HI>immediate</HI> Operations of GOD:
<PB N="11" REF="005681_0009_1026BBA393FEFCF0">
they are no more miraculous, than his <HI>immediate</HI> Impression of Gravity on material Substances, or on any primary Substance whereby the Impression may be made on others.</P>
<P N="2">2. In his Operation on Substances <HI>purely spiritual</HI>&mdash;He not only by his continual Influence preserves them in their distin|guishing Existence, Nature or essential Properties of <HI>Life,</HI> and Powers of <HI>Perceiving, Thinking, voluntary Motion,</HI> &amp;c. He has been pleas'd to give them; but to this Influence He also seems to add his further <HI>usual</HI> Operations in these <HI>three</HI> Ways.</P>
<P N="1">(1) By <HI>producing</HI> and continuing secret, inward <HI>Bents</HI> or <HI>Dispositions</HI> in them; as the holy Bents of holy Angels, and holy Souls departed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) By <HI>raising</HI> and continuing <HI>Idoeas</HI> in their Imaginations, Memories and Understandings; as also impressing them with various Perceptions of <HI>Delight</HI> or <HI>Trouble:</HI> Whereby he chiefly seems to rule the <HI>moral</HI> World. So he continually gives the Millions of holy Angels his Directions: And they are con|stantly attending to him, and in every Part of the Universe accomplishing his Orders. And so he makes the holy An|gels happy with Perceptions of pure Delight; and the sinful Angels wretched with Perceptions of Anxiety.</P>
<P N="3">(3) By <HI>awakening, sharpening, strengthening, guiding</HI> their <HI>intellectual Powers,</HI> to conceive and penetrate; compare, distinguish and judge of Things, and contrive and form their Schemes; and by <HI>exciting</HI> their Pursuits: Whereby he secretly and wonderfully governs in the midst of numberless Contin|gencies among the Creatures.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="3">3. With Respect to Creatures <HI>Compos'd</HI> of Substances both <HI>Corporeal and Spiritual,</HI> as <HI>brutal Animals</HI> and <HI>Men;</HI> his Ope|rations on them may be of all the various Kinds together, according to their several Natures and Capacities, we have in brief described; besides <HI>writing</HI> them, <HI>keeping</HI> them <HI>united,</HI> and some peculiar Impressions of <HI>Pleasure, Pain,</HI> &amp;c. suitable to their mysterious <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005681_0010_1026BBA543700140">
And it seems highly reasonable to think, that where the Powers of <HI>inferiour</HI> Creatures suffice not to accomplish his Designs, He employs the <HI>higher,</HI> or <HI>both</HI> together: And where they are all insufficient, He puts forth <HI>his</HI> Power above them; makes them instrumental as far as may be, and then acts by <HI>his own superiour</HI> Influence.</P>
<P>As to <HI>brutal Animals</HI>&mdash;they no doubt receive their various <HI>Instincts</HI> from him: And he may by <HI>Angels</HI> often give them Idaeas and rule them.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>Men</HI>&mdash;He no doubt inspires their various <HI>Ge|niuses:</HI> As also frequently, if not continually, uses <HI>Angels,</HI> the <HI>Evil</HI> by Permission, the <HI>Holy</HI> by Command, to suggest <HI>Idoeas</HI> to them; and then uses <HI>them</HI> to suggest Idaeas to <HI>one another:</HI> Which are instrumental Causes under his permissive, con|trolling and directive Influence, of numberless Passions, Ap|petites, Consultations, Projects, Resolutions, Actions and Events. He awakens, sharpens, strengthens, guides the in|tellectual Powers of <HI>Men:</HI> And where the Powers of <HI>Angels</HI> are insufficient to give compleat Idaeas to perform his Schemes; He may <HI>secretly</HI> by his <HI>immediate</HI> Operation, utterly unknown to Men, suggest innumerable <HI>Idoeas</HI> in them; and therewith in|fuse his exciting Influence of Zeal, Activity, Courage and Re|solution to fulfill his Councils.</P>
<P>Nor may the unknown <HI>Suggestions</HI> of <HI>good Angels</HI> be ac|counted <HI>proper Inspirations;</HI> any more than the Suggestions of <HI>Satan</HI> when he raises up in our Minds Idaeas of Scriptures, as he did in the humane Mind of CHRIST: Or when one <HI>Man</HI> by Signs suggests Idaeas to others, and excites their Courage. Nor are the <HI>Idoeas</HI> and <HI>Excitations</HI> receiv'd from GOD, either <HI>mediately</HI> by Men or Angels, or <HI>immediately</HI> by Himself, <HI>proper Inspirations:</HI> Any more than his infusing Mil|lions of Spirits every Moment into new Seeds or Embrios of Animals, making them alive and active; or infusing into them various Instincts or Geniuses; or impressing them with Pleasures, Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For, by <HI>Inspiration</HI> I mean <HI>the certain Revelation</HI> he has been pleas'd to give of <HI>Himself</HI> &amp; of his <HI>Will,</HI> &amp; of Things past and to come, by CHRIST and his Prophets and Apostles of old,
<PB N="13" REF="005681_0011_1026BBA95A4EB5F0">
put into the BIBLE and confirm'd by Miracles, as a <HI>definitive Rule</HI> of Faith, Worship, moral and religious Conduct. Every Kind of <HI>Idoea</HI> and <HI>Excitation</HI> or <HI>Propension</HI> in us, whether arising meerly from our own Minds, or from evil or good Men and Mi|nisters, or from evil or good Angels, or even immediately from GOD himself, are therefore all to be brought to this only in|spired Rule, and tried thereby; for which End it was inspired and confirmed. And the <HI>true Origin</HI> of our Idaeas and Ex|citations is kept <HI>concealed</HI> from us, (without any <HI>internal Cri|terion</HI> to judge from whence they come, as the <HI>Prophets</HI> had of Old) that by <HI>this known divine Rule</HI> we might forever try them. In which Trial, we are carefully to use our intellectual Powers: And being aware that in the midst of all we need the Help of GOD, both in understanding the Rule and in the Application of it; to Him we must humbly and ever repair in CHRIST and seek for Guidance.</P>
<P>For Illustration&mdash;I might easily bring a Multitude of Scrip|tures; but the Time would fail me. I shall only cite to <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> xxii. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxix. <HI>Job</HI> v. xii. xxxii&mdash;xxxv. <HI>Psal.</HI> xxxiv. xlvii. ciii. civ. cvii. and cxiii. <HI>Isai.</HI> xxviii and xliv. <HI>Dan.</HI> ii and iv. <HI>Joel</HI> i. and ii. <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 29, 30. <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 24,&mdash;28.</P>
<P>In short, all Nature, both inanimate and animate, both humane and angelical, is full of GOD; full of his perpetual moving, guiding and over-ruling Influence; and as the Apostle perfectly expresses it, Eph. i. 11. <HI>Who worketh all Things ac|cording to the Council of his own Will.</HI></P>
<P>But then I may not omit to observe, that agreeable to <HI>Scripture-Revelation,</HI> THE ETERNAL WORD or SON of GOD, who with the eternal FATHER and SPIRIT created all Things; in a perfect Union with those divine Persons, He also upholds and rules the World from the <HI>Time he made it:</HI> But from the <HI>Fall,</HI> He rules it also in the special Form of a MEDIATOR: And upon the Exaltation of his <HI>humane Na|ture</HI> to Heaven, it is advanced to a wondrous Participation with his DIVINE PERSON, in his supreme Dignity, tran|scendent Glory, and universal Empire. See <HI>John</HI> i. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. <HI>Col.</HI> i. <HI>Heb.</HI> i. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005681_0012_1026BBAADF6C9228">
And thus have we shewn in what <HI>Manner</HI> may the sove|reign GOD be said to <HI>operate usually</HI> among his Creatures.</P>
<P>We now come more briefly to consider,</P>
<P>II. When have <HI>his providential Operations</HI> such lively Cha|racters of their being <HI>his Doings,</HI> as they are evidently so to unprejudic'd and careful Observers.</P>
<P>Even the common Operations in the <HI>meerly material</HI> World, the more we search them, the more they appear to be the Doings of GOD. But there is such a natural Atheism, Blindness, and Prejudice in us, as we are averse to see it, and prone to ascribe them to <HI>Nature only,</HI> or any thing else than his ever acting Influence. A terrible Storm of Thunder and Lightning, or a more fearful Earthquake, or some ex|traordinary Danger or other, seems needful to bring us to see his Operations in <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And so it is likewise in his <HI>mixt Operations</HI> of <HI>Providence.</HI> When there is only a Circle of common Occurrences, we are apt to imagine there is only a Course of Nature, blended with the common Powers, Arts, Contrivances and Actions of Men; and the Doings of GOD appear not in them. We have therefore need of some extraordinary Work of GOD in Providence, to awaken our Minds and more evidently show his Doings. And this he graciously condescends to give us in the <HI>following Cases.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. When in <HI>Affairs of vast Importance,</HI> there is a wonder|ful continued <HI>Train</HI> and timely <HI>Coincidence</HI> of <HI>innumerable Va|rieties of Means,</HI> both in the <HI>material</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> World toge|ther, without our Power and beyond our Prospect, all conspi|ring to some <HI>great Event,</HI> exceeding <HI>happy</HI> in its present In|fluence and future Tendency.</P>
<P>For tho' in such extraordinary Works of GOD as these, the <HI>several Parts</HI> consider'd <HI>singly,</HI> are his <HI>usual</HI> Operations and don't affect with Wonder, or strike our Minds with so clear and strong an Evidence of their being his Doings: Yet to see them all so perfectly adjusted, as to make up <HI>One, great, wise, curious and consistent Scheme,</HI> to accomplish an <HI>Event of
<PB N="15" REF="005681_0013_1026BBACD0893B08">
vast Importance;</HI>&mdash;This yields sufficient Evidence of wise Design and superiour Management in HIM, who has all the Powers of Nature, Men and Angels in his Hands, and over|rules them all to fulfill his Purposes.</P>
<P N="2">2. This yet appears with a stronger Evidence, and even still more wonderous; when among a great Number of sur|prizing and important <HI>Incidents,</HI> there are many so <HI>momentous</HI> and <HI>critical,</HI> that if any one had not fallen precisely in its special Place and Juncture, there wou'd have been exceeding great Imbarrassments and Hindrances; and many others so <HI>essential,</HI> that if all and every one had not come in exactly as they did; the great Event had fail'd, and the main Scheme with all its vast and curious Apparatus totally miscarried.</P>
<P N="3">3. When in <HI>exceeding difficult, perplex'd and dangerous Cases</HI> which look almost <HI>desperate,</HI> and much more which seem in a Manner <HI>lost,</HI> there <HI>opens at once</HI> a <HI>great Deliverance,</HI> beyond our Power and Thought: And much more still, when the Deliverance opens with <HI>Success,</HI> and the very <HI>Means</HI> of our Distress and Danger are made subservient to our Prosperity and Safety.</P>
<P N="4">4, and lastly, When in this Conjuncture, the sovereign GOD is more than usually acknowledged; looked to and trusted in; an <HI>extraordinary Spirit of Prayer</HI> is raised up in many; and all these surprizing Incidents and Means, with all our wonderful Salvations, Success and Happiness, come on in punctual Answers to <HI>many fervent and fiducial Addresses</HI> to Him.</P>
<P>I might mention <HI>Other</HI> Cases and illustrate <HI>These;</HI> but the Hour would fail me. And to make the larger Room for the Application, we must be also short on our.</P>
<P>III General Head; which is to represent the <HI>pious Admira|tion</HI> which these extraordinary Appearances and Works of GOD should raise up in us, and which they happily raise if we are duly disposed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005681_0014_1026BBB05910EE60">
<HI>Admiration</HI> is one of the sublimest Actions of a created Spi|rit. It is the rising up of the Mind in a respectful View of Something it sees and owns to be superiour to it. And when it rises to the reverent View of GOD, it rises to the highest and most worthy Object, and pays him some of the Honour in the highest Measure eternally due to his transcendent Ex|cellencies and Operations.</P>
<P>And as this all wise CREATOR has made us capable of this noble <HI>Action,</HI> and in our very <HI>Make</HI> infused a <HI>Disposition</HI> to it on extraordinary Appearances; he therefore frequently does extraordinary Things in Providence, to awake our At|tention and excite our Wonder; to give us more open Dis|plays of his supream Wisdom, Power and Government, and raise our due and reverent Admirations of him.</P>
<P>In the <HI>heavenly World;</HI> from the inexhaustible Source of his infinite Perfections, no doubt there now are and will be eter|nally surprizing Displays of his Glories, to the perpetual and entertaining Wonder of the happy Inhabitants. But as in <HI>these lower Regions</HI> we frequently need them, he frequently gives them: And if we were as observant as <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> we should find abundant Cause to cry out in Admiration of GOD as He, Job v. 9. <HI>Who does great Things and unsearchable, marvellous Things without Number.</HI></P>
<P>But when the sovereign GOD is pleas'd, in <HI>distinguishing Favour</HI> to us, to go out of his common Course, and show a vast Contrivance, and over-rule a Multitude of all Kinds of Causes, making them conspire to some <HI>great and happy Event,</HI> or do something <HI>extraordinary</HI> for our Salvation and vast Ad|vantage;&mdash;Then he more highly obliges us, and more loudly calls us to consider his wondrous Works; to see HIM, i. e. his superiour Hand and Excellencies in them, and pay our due and distinguishing Admirations to him.</P>
<P>Then we should carefully lay aside every <HI>Prejudice:</HI> And our obliged Souls should <HI>open</HI> to every Beam of Light and Evidence of the Operation and Care of GOD in all the Parts of the Providence, and forming them all into an admirable System. We should enlarge our Views to see the <HI>vast Im|portance</HI> of his wondrous Work, both to Ourselves and Others,
<PB N="17" REF="005681_0015_1026BBB3CE1FD840">
in all its Branches: And attentively mind the <HI>various Springs and Incidents</HI> in the Run of the Whole, and how they all sur|prizingly conspire to a prosperous Issue. Nor yet&mdash;content with the bare viewing of these; but our grateful Minds should see the <HI>Wisdom, Power, Justice, Holiness, Truth</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD illustrious in them; and then consider how He should thus be working for <HI>Us,</HI> while we were unworthy of the least of his Mercies. Lastly in our admiring Views of the whole Work of GOD, our Souls should rise into the high|est reverent Admiration of Him; and then brake out in most thankful Praise, as the pious Psalmist&mdash;<HI>It is the</HI> LORD'<HI>s Do|ing! It is marvellous in our Eyes!</HI></P>
<P>And as all this is clearly most due to GOD on such Appear|ances, it is the lively <HI>Bent</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of unfeigned <HI>Piety.</HI></P>
<P>But we must hasten on to APPLY these Things, in Pur|suance of our first Design, to the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>extraordinary Occa|sion</HI> of this happy Solemnity.</P>
<P>For, the sovereign GOD, who ruleth by his Power for ever, and does what he pleases among the Sons of Men, has by a surprizing Course of Providence led us into a most ad|venturous Enterprize against the <HI>French</HI> Settlements at <HI>Cape-|Breton,</HI> and their exceeding strong City of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> for warlike Power the Pride and Terror of these northern Seas; and by a wonderous Series and happy Coincidence of various Means, deliver'd them into our Hands. And this, in a most signal Manner, is <HI>The</HI> LORD'<HI>s Doing</HI> in the <HI>present Day;</HI> and is truly <HI>marvellous</HI> in every <HI>pious,</HI> yea, I may say, in every <HI>un|prejudic'd</HI> and <HI>considerate</HI> Eye.</P>

<P N="1">1. In brief lay open to view the <HI>vast Importance</HI> of the <HI>Place;</HI> that we may more clearly see the <HI>Greatness</HI> of the <HI>Mercy</HI> in giving it to us: And then</P>

I. In brief lay open to view the <HI>vast Importance</HI> of the <HI>Place;</HI> that we may more clearly see the <HI>Greatness</HI> of the <HI>Mercy</HI> in giving it to us.</P>
<P>The Island belong'd originally to the <HI>British Empire:</HI> Was at first compriz'd in the general Name and grand Patent of <HI>New-England</HI> in 1620; but in the following Year set off and included in <HI>Noca Scotia</HI> by a separate Patent; and since, in <HI>Noca Scotia</HI> comprehended in the Royal Charter of the <HI>Massachasetts Province</HI> in 1691.</P>
<P>It abounds in the best of <HI>Pit Coul</HI> known in <HI>America:</HI> And so near the Surface of the Earth and Coast of the Sea, as to be very easily dug and put in Vessels. Yea, from 1703, <HI>Lahontan</HI> had told us of the <HI>French Ships</HI> loading with and carrying the same to <HI>Gaudalupe</HI> and <HI>Martineco,</HI> for the refin|ing of Sugars, to their great Advantage. And its <HI>commodious Harbours;</HI> with its <HI>happy Situation</HI> in the Centre of our Fishery, at the Entrance of the Bay and River of <HI>Canada,</HI> and in the Wake of all the Trade from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>British Colonies</HI> on the <HI>Main Land</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and both from <HI>them</HI> and our <HI>West India Islands</HI> to <HI>Europe;</HI> rendered the Place of such vast Importance&mdash;that I remember while in <HI>England,</HI> when we came to know the Tory Ministry had by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> in 1713, resign'd it to the <HI>French;</HI> all true-hearted <HI>Britons</HI> who knew the Circumstance of the <HI>Island,</HI> most grie|vously lamented the Resignation, as full of teeming Mischief to the <HI>British</HI> Trade, Wealth and Power, and as one of the most fatal Acts of that unhappy Ministry.</P>
<P>And the <HI>mischievous Consequence</HI> has since every Year been a growing Confirmation of their judicious Prospects. For the <HI>French</HI> well knowing the vast Advantage of their Acquisition, have built a <HI>walled City</HI> on the most convenient Port both for Trade and Fortification;&mdash;for these <HI>Thirty Years</HI> been ad|ding to its natural and artificial Strength; and by immense Sums and the utmost Art and Diligence, made it one of the strongest <HI>Fortresses</HI> in <HI>America</HI> if not in <HI>Europe:</HI> Such as was not like to be taken without a very powerful, skillful and re|solute Army both by Sea and Land, or being starved to a Surrender. In short, it was the <HI>Dunkirk</HI> of <HI>North America,</HI> and in some Respects of greater Importance.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005681_0017_1026BBB82F0D0B40">
For, by Means of this <HI>Island</HI> and <HI>Fortification,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> have every Year enlarged their <HI>Fishery;</HI> and thereby their <HI>Trade, Wealth</HI> and <HI>Shipping:</HI> And by Fishing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> than we, they have more and more commanded <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> of <HI>Spain, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> drawn away their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and Sil|ver; and greatly diminish'd our Trade and Fishery, a prin|cipal Source both of the <HI>British</HI> Wealth and naval Power.</P>
<P>So pernicious a Settlement was this&mdash;that for above these <HI>Twenty Years,</HI> it has seem'd to me, 'twere worth the while to engage in a <HI>War</HI> with <HI>France,</HI> if 'twere for nothing else but to recover this most important <HI>Island</HI> to the <HI>British Em|pire.</HI> Tho' a War was dreadful, the Necessity and Hazard seem'd every Year to encrease: The longer 'twas deferr'd, the more powerful and dangerous they grew, and the less our Hope of their being ever reduced.</P>
<P>Yea, from the Consideration of such a <HI>strong Defence,</HI> the Advantage of <HI>Wood, Sea-Coal, Fishery,</HI> and <HI>Free-Gift Land</HI> in this and the neighbouring Islands, the Settlement of <HI>Thousands</HI> of People on them already, and the innumerable Poor in the Sea-Coast Towns of <HI>France,</HI> ever swarming and coming over to them;&mdash;it seems highly probable, that if the <HI>Peace</HI> conti|nued much longer, there would be in a few Years Time such a Multitude of <HI>French Inhabitants,</HI> as with the growing Num|bers in the bordering Continent of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> and <HI>Canada,</HI> with the addition of the <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> would exceedingly vex and waste, yea, endanger the Conquest of our <HI>English Colonies.</HI></P>
<P>At length, without our Seeking, &amp; in the most critical Time, the LORD was pleas'd to leave them to <HI>proaecipitate</HI> a <HI>War</HI> upon us. An unexpected Season opens to make the dange|rous Trial, if the ALMIGHTY would please to prosper us. And now <HI>all the northern Colonies</HI> and <HI>Ours especially</HI> began to feel their destructive Power and Influence: In a <HI>few Months</HI> Time, infesting our Coasts, taking our Shipping, ruining our Fishery and Trade, destroying <HI>Canso,</HI> invading <HI>Annapolis,</HI> re|ducing us to Straits, and carrying our People Captive into a Place almost impregnable.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005681_0018_1026BBBBED1C7E10">
And as it was a <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Privateers</HI> and <HI>Men of War</HI> di|stressing to <HI>Us;</HI> it was also a safe <HI>Resort,</HI> both of their <HI>West</HI> and <HI>East India Fleets,</HI> to their great Advantage in returning Homeward.</P>
<P>Of such <HI>vast Importance</HI> was this <HI>strong Port</HI> of our Ene|mies; and this possess'd by one of the most enterprizing, powerful and active of Nations.</P>
<P>But in the Wisdom of GOD, the stronger it grew, the better in the Issue for <HI>us:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> having built a regular City, and laid out immensely more to render it both strong and commodious, than <HI>we</HI> should, if the Place had been in <HI>our</HI> Power. Yea, it seems most likely, that if <HI>they</HI> had not possess'd it, there would neither have been a Battery, nor even a House in the <HI>Port</HI> to this Day; no more than in many fine Harbours of <HI>Nova Scotia;</HI> which tho' so near the Fishery, have been neglected by us for so many Years, from the Peace of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> But now in a <HI>few Weeks</HI> Time, the sovereign GOD has pleased to give us the Fruits of these <HI>Thirty Years</HI> prodigious Art, Labour and Expence of our Enemies: And this by Means of so small a Number, less than <HI>Four thousand</HI> Land-Men, unus'd to War, undisciplin'd, and that had never seen a Siege in their Lives. <HI>It is the</HI> LORD'<HI>s Doing! It is marvellous in our Eyes!</HI></P>
<P>II. Let us therefore look into the <HI>wonderous Scenes</HI> of <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> and see some of the various and surprizing <HI>Steps</HI> which led to the happy <HI>Acquisition.</HI></P>
<P>And these we may review under these <HI>Two</HI> Heads&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>remarkable Steps</HI> which <HI>led</HI> to the dangerous <HI>En|terprise:</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>surprizing Steps succeeding</HI> us therein.</P>
<P N="1">1] The <HI>remarkable Steps</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> which <HI>led</HI> us to the adventurous <HI>Enterprize.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005681_0019_1026BBBE6DC139F0">
I have already hinted at these <HI>Two</HI> Particulars&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Our <HI>Enemies</HI> being left of GOD, in Opposition to all the Rules of Policy, but in too early Confidence of their sufficient Growth of Power, while engag'd with the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> to hurry into a <HI>War</HI> with <HI>us;</HI> while <HI>their trading Ships</HI> were mostly abroad, <HI>their Navy</HI> not so well prepar'd, and <HI>ours</HI> by the previous War with <HI>Spain,</HI> equipt and ready to employ its Power for our Defence and their Annoyance: It seems in as happy a Juncture as we could wish for: With|out which we should not have had the Advantage or Oppor|tunity which they have opened to us.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> early and suddenly seizing <HI>Canso,</HI> invading <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and M. <HI>De Vivier</HI> going to <HI>France</HI> for additional Forces by Sea and Land, to renew the Assault in the Spring of the Year;&mdash;were improv'd by GOD as a Means of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ouzing us up with the Sense of Danger, and of exciting our <HI>Governour</HI> to implore the KING for some <HI>naval</HI> Help: Without which it seems that Commodore <HI>Warren</HI> with his <HI>Three Ships</HI> of War had not been ordered from our <HI>West India Islands</HI> to <HI>New-England;</HI> Tho' then, I suppose, without any special View to this important Enterprize.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the <HI>Cape-Bretoners</HI> taking and carrying so many of our People into their <HI>Harbour</HI> and <HI>City,</HI> they were obliged to return them to us: Whereby we came to be more acquaint|ed with their Scituation and the proper Places of landing and attacking: And at the same Time it is in the Issue happy, they were not fully aware of the prodigious Strength of the <HI>Fortifications,</HI> or of the great Number of <HI>Men</HI> within and near them; or we never had presum'd on such an Enterprize: Yea, 'tis happy that some few, who better knowing the Place, gave the more exact Accounts and spake discouraging; yet we were so set on sending, they were not regarded.</P>
<P N="4">4. GOD was pleased to give <HI>last Summer</HI> a great <HI>Plenty</HI> of Provision to our <HI>northern Colonies;</HI> whereby we were <HI>this Spring</HI> prepared to supply so great an Armament: And at the same Time cut short the Crops in <HI>Canada</HI> and the <HI>French West India Islands;</HI> whereby 'twas apprehended that Those at <HI>Cape Breton</HI> were considerably <HI>straitened,</HI> and that both the <HI>Canada|French</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="005681_0020_1026BBC0233A43C8">
and <HI>Indians</HI> were hindered the last Year from troubling our <HI>inland Borders.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. By our Accounts of the Uneasiness of the <HI>Switzers</HI> There, for want of Pay and Provision; and the Call and Wants of their <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West India Fleet</HI> in the <HI>Fall</HI> of the Year, and their Supplies with Men and Victuals, if not Am|munition; 'twas represented, the remaining French were further <HI>weakened;</HI> and we were the more encouraged. And 'twas further remarkable, that their <HI>Store Ships</HI> from <HI>France</HI> in the <HI>Fall</HI> came so late on their Coast, and the Winter There set in so early and fierce, as to keep them out of their Harbour and drive them off to <HI>Martincco.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. From the sanguine Representations made by our return|ed Captives, of the Easiness of our taking the Place by an early Surprizal before any Help could come, either from <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Canada;</HI> GOD was pleased to lead our <HI>Governour,</HI> vigilant and active for our Safety and Welfare, into the Project: And early forming the Scheme; in the most timely Season, in the midst of Winter, when our Intercourse abroad was sealed up, to move and press it on the <HI>General Assembly;</HI> and after, in convenient Time, on our <HI>neighbouring Governments;</HI> and with wonderous Resolution, Circumspection and Assiduity to pursue the same.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tho' when the Affair was first propos'd to the <HI>General Court,</HI> the Difficulties seem'd so great and the Expence so sinking to this poor People, that they saw no Light to ven|ture without a powerful, previous Help from <HI>England;</HI> yet upon further Representations, that the Season would likely be lost for ever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Affair was unexpectedly reconsider'd: And the sovereign GOD so over-rul'd the <HI>Absence</HI> of diverse worthy Representatives, who judged it too vast an Underta|king for us; that 'tis said the <HI>final Resolution</HI> for it on <HI>Jan.</HI> 25, was just carried But by <HI>one</HI> Majority: And even that and other Votes had been lost, if the superiour Greatness of the <HI>Expence</HI> had been then imagined; it soon abundantly exceed|ing their Expectations.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the <HI>General Court</HI> had <HI>agreed</HI> on this great En|terprize, it is surprizing to think, with how profound a <HI>Se|cresy,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="005681_0021_1026BBC1C3A12360">
so many Members in the Centre of so populous, obser|ving and inquisitive a Town as this, for so many Days, kept their Consultations; 'till the various Parts of the Plan were settled, Committees chosen, and all Things ripe for enlisting Soldiers, hiring Vessels, buying Materials and Provisions: And as surprizing to see with what a general <HI>Silence</HI> all these Things were done in this City and Land; and the Army and Fleet equipt and ready to sail, while the Rest of the World had scarce any Intelligence of our Preparations.</P>
<P N="9">9. As soon as ever the <HI>Design</HI> was <HI>known</HI> among us, it was a marvellous Thing, that when <HI>this Province</HI> had lately lost so <HI>many Hundred</HI> Men <HI>Voluntiers</HI> in the sad Expedition to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> not <HI>One</HI> in <HI>Ten</HI> being alive to return, their Wives left Widows and their Children Orphans;&mdash;yet to see so many <HI>likely Men,</HI> and I conclude the most of them Owners of Lands and Houses, or Heirs of the same, and many Reli|gious, in all our Towns, readily listing even as private Sol|diers; with the small Wages of <HI>Twenty-five Shillings</HI> a <HI>Month,</HI> to leave their gainful Farms and Trades, as well as Parents, Wives and Children; all as <HI>free Voluntiers,</HI> to serve their GOD, their <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> in this hazardous Enterprize: Yea, more to list than the Court desired: And that so many Men of distinguish'd <HI>Figure</HI> should cheerfully offer themselves&mdash;even <HI>Four</HI> of his MAJESTY'<HI>S Council</HI> for <HI>this Province,</HI> among them the Hon. <HI>William Pepperrell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the first of the Council; as also the Hon. <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> of <HI>Connecticut Colony;</HI> and <HI>diverse Others</HI> of <HI>publick Esteem</HI> and <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. It was wonderful also to see that during those <HI>Two</HI> usually stormy Months of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> the only Sea|son for our Preparation, GOD was pleased to give us such a <HI>constant Series</HI> of <HI>moderate</HI> and <HI>fair Weather,</HI> as in that Time of the Year has scarce ever been known among us: So that there was hardly any Impediment to our Officers going about and enlisting, or our Soldiers in marching, or our Vessels in sitting, or our Coasters in bringing us Provisions, or our Committee of War in their various Preparations, 'till all were ready to sail.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005681_0022_1026BBC5C76B2B80">
11. The extraordinary Tho't, Contrivance, Order, Manage|ment and quick Dispatch, not only of HIS EXCELLENCY, but also of our <HI>Council of War,</HI> seems wonderful&mdash;that Gen|tlemen unus'd to such Affairs, should in <HI>Two Months</HI> Time, think of and get ready every Thing suitable for so great and various an Armament by Sea and Land: So that nothing proper seems to have been omitted. And I have heard some express themselves with Wonder to see how Things would happen:&mdash;Just as they wanted some Kinds of <HI>Materials</HI> or <HI>Provisions,</HI> an unexpected <HI>Vessel</HI> wou'd come in and bring them.</P>
<P N="12">12. It was also wonderful&mdash;that tho' the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> which has been so fatal and dreadful to us, came into <HI>this Town</HI> and <HI>Harbour,</HI> as our Troops were coming in both by Land and Water, and continued all the Time they were quartering and anchoring here, very few of the Officers or Soldiers ha|ving had it, and we were full of anxious Apprehensions; yet it neither hindred them, nor did the dangerous Infection spread among them; which in that critical Juncture would, after all, have wholly overthrown the Enterprize.</P>
<P>And now our Army of <HI>Three Thousand</HI> Land Soldiers, with all Kinds of Stores being ready to sail on the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> in about a <HI>Hundred Vessels,</HI> besides <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Soldiers more sent from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Three Hundred and Fifty</HI> from <HI>New-Hampshire</HI>&mdash;we had almost every gloomy Prospect to make us tremble.</P>
<P>For our <HI>inland Borders</HI> were now left bare of a great Part of their Strength, by the listing of so many of their able Men <HI>Voluntiers</HI> in the Expedition. And if the Enter|prize succeeded, the <HI>heavy Debt</HI> would almost sink us. But if, for our Offences, GOD were carrying forth a great Part of the <HI>Flower</HI> of <HI>our Country</HI> to be destroy'd; a most dismal Scene of Ruin seem'd to follow! They were to sail <HI>Five Hundred Miles</HI> to the Enemies Island, in a <HI>raw</HI> and <HI>stormy Time</HI> of the Year. And if the fear'd <HI>Infection</HI> had taken Place and should brake out among them, especially after their Landing; what a general Terror would seize them from the Hand of GOD which there was no resisting, and in what a miserable Case would they be! A naval Power with Stores
<PB N="25" REF="005681_0023_1026BBC97AAE79E8">
and disciplin'd Troops were also early expected There from <HI>France,</HI> to conquer <HI>Nova Scotia:</HI> And after all the Labours of our unwearied <HI>Governour,</HI> to obtain some <HI>Men of War</HI> from our <HI>neighbouring Colonies</HI> and <HI>West India Islands,</HI> to come and protect and help us; <HI>our hopeful Prospects seem'd to dwindle away</HI>&mdash;and we could see no other but that, if <HI>Two Sixty Gun Ships</HI> of our Enemies, which were early expected, should ar|rive before we took the Place, they would soon make our <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Army</HI> Captives:&mdash;And then what would become of this Country!</P>
<P>So they must run the most desperate Hazards. The Hearts of many of the wisest ashore now seem'd to fail. Some re|pented they had voted for it, and others that they had ever promoted it. Some judged it best after all for every Man to to go Home; and the Thoughtful among us were in great Per|plexity.&mdash;But yet a Wonder it was to see, that those who were venturing into the Danger, seem'd to be fullest of Trust in GOD and Courage. Many fill'd their Vessels with <HI>Prayers;</HI> and asking <HI>Ours,</HI> they threw themselves into the divine Pro|tection, <HI>in the Name of</HI> GOD <HI>they set up their Banners,</HI> and away they sail'd. <HI>Pray for</HI> US, <HI>and we'll Fight for</HI> YOU&mdash;was the valiant and endearing Language wherewith they left us.</P>
<P>Thus have we traced some of the <HI>remarkable Steps</HI> which <HI>led</HI> to this <HI>dangerous Enterprize.</HI> We now come</P>
<P N="2">2] To view some of the more surprizing <HI>Steps</HI> of Provi|dence <HI>succeeding</HI> therein to the <HI>happy Accomplishment.</HI></P>
<P>And as these are more in Number than can be reckon'd, I may here but mention a few&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. As it was very encouraging to think how many <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>prayerful</HI> Persons were embarqu'd in the Cause, which we accounted the Cause of GOD and his People; it gave fur|ther Ground of Hope, to see such a <HI>Spirit of Supplication</HI> given to many in this Town and Land on this Occasion. For be|sides the solemn Days of <HI>publick</HI> and <HI>general Prayer</HI> appointed by <HI>these three Governments;</HI> there were <HI>particular Days</HI> observed in several Congregations. There were also in diverse Towns
<PB N="26" REF="005681_0024_1026BBCB37BAC110">
<HI>religious Societies,</HI> some of Women as well as others of Men, which met <HI>every Week,</HI> more privately to pray for the Preservation and Success of their dear Countrymen: And I have been well informed of their extraordinary Fervency, Faith and Wrestlings, as so many <HI>Jacobs,</HI> in this important Season. <HI>Psal.</HI> cviii. 10&mdash;13. was usually among our Petitions: As also, <Q>That GOD would preserve, direct and spirit our Friends; and surprize and terrify our Enemies; and make them yield without much Blood-shed, and in such a Man|ner as the <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> might appear to be <HI>his alone.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. GOD then began in a remarkable Manner to hear our Prayers: In that when so many <HI>Vessels</HI> sail'd from <HI>Hence</HI> and from <HI>New Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> in such a turbulent Time of the Year, thro' a Course of <HI>Five Hundred Miles</HI> on the Ocean; they every one arriv'd at <HI>Canso,</HI> the Place of Concourse, about <HI>sixty Miles</HI> on this Side <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> with|out the Loss of more than <HI>One Soldier</HI> and <HI>Three Seamen,</HI> and but <HI>Fifteen sick;</HI> and <HI>Time enough</HI> to meet together and refresh themselves, and get into Order for their Descent at <HI>Louishourg.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It was remarkable also, that GOD was pleas'd to keep our Enemies <HI>Shore</HI> and <HI>Harbour</HI> inviron'd with <HI>Ice</HI> longer than usual: So that none of their Vessels could enter nor go forth for Intelligence, 'till our <HI>Twenty Gun Cruizers</HI> (which our <HI>Governour</HI> sent above a <HI>Fortnight</HI> before the Rest of the Fleet) came Thither: And that some of <HI>their Vessels</HI> coming early to them, both before and after the Harbour was open, were happily intercepted and <HI>taken</HI> by <HI>Ours;</HI> whereby our <HI>Enemies within</HI> fail'd of their Supplies, and <HI>We</HI> were recruited by those <HI>without.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That by a most gracious, seasonable and wonderful Di|rection of GOD, thro' our <HI>Governour'</HI>s Sollicitations the <HI>Fall before,</HI> the brave and active Commodore <HI>Warren,</HI> a great Friend to these Plantations, is ordered by the Government in <HI>England,</HI> to come immediately with <HI>Three Men of War</HI> from <HI>Antego</HI> to <HI>Boston:</HI> That on his Voyage hither near <HI>Cape Sables,</HI> he, on <HI>April</HI> 12th, met with a <HI>Fisherman,</HI> who inform'd him of our Army's being gone to <HI>Canso</HI> the <HI>Week before:</HI> That on board the Fisherman there was <HI>One</HI> of the best of <HI>Pilots,</HI> who had got out of the Way of our Committee of
<PB N="27" REF="005681_0025_10269203D982A7A8">
War, to avoid being press'd for the Service: That tho' the <HI>Commodore</HI> wanted fresh Provision and Cloaths for his Men in so cold a Climate and Season; he wisely consider'd the ne|cessitous Case of our Army, took the Pilot, generously <HI>tack'd about,</HI> went after them, overtook them at <HI>Canso,</HI> to their great Joy; and instead of stopping, pass'd on to watch the <HI>Harbour</HI> of <HI>Louishourg,</HI> that no Supply from <HI>Canada, Martineco</HI> or <HI>France</HI> might slip into it: <HI>Without all which</HI> a 64 <HI>Gun Ship</HI> with near 600 <HI>Men</HI> and full of <HI>Stores,</HI> had enter'd, and this great Affair had been soon defeated.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>Commodore,</HI> by the <HI>Fishermen,</HI> sent his Order for the King's Ships that should be found in these Parts, forth|with to follow him: That the Fisherman timely arriving, our <HI>Governour</HI> immediately sent the Order to a 40 Gun Ship at <HI>Piscataqua</HI> ready to convoy the Mast Fleet for <HI>England:</HI> And tho' she was got to Sea, yet by a Boat the Order reach'd her; and sending her Fleet into Harbour, she bore after the Com|modore and quickly join'd him. So that our <HI>Army</HI> before they fail'd from <HI>Canso,</HI> had the Comfort of 4 <HI>Men</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> under GOD to protect and help them.</P>
<P N="6">6. That tho' our <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Army</HI> staid near <HI>three Weeks</HI> at <HI>Canso,</HI> within 20 <HI>Leagues</HI> of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and within Sight of <HI>their Island;</HI> yet the People <HI>There</HI> knew nothing of it, 'till early in the Morning <HI>April</HI> 30, when they were so surpriz'd to see us, that they had no Time to get in the fresh Provision and Force of the <HI>neighbouring Country</HI> to help them. It seems very wonderful, that none of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> near to <HI>Canso,</HI> should happen to see us, and give our Enemies Intel|ligence of us: And when our <HI>Fleet</HI> and <HI>Army</HI> were compleat and ready, the <HI>Ice</HI> went off at once; and the Winds and Weather conspir'd to favour our Descent on <HI>the Island.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. It is also remarkable, that the <HI>French</HI> had made <HI>no For|tification</HI> at the <HI>Place</HI> of our <HI>Landing,</HI> tho' 'tis said they de|sign'd it, and were preparing for it: And tho' they had <HI>Six Hundred</HI> regular Troops, and about <HI>Fourteen Hundred</HI> other Men in the <HI>City,</HI> that yet they should make so small an Opposition at our going ashore: That GOD so encourag'd and help'd the few who landed first and engag'd them, as to beat them away with the Loss of <HI>Eight</HI> of <HI>their</HI> Men <HI>stain,</HI> several <HI>wound|ed,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="005681_0026_1026BBD5A595D380">
and <HI>Ten</HI> taken <HI>captive,</HI> without the Loss of <HI>One</HI> of <HI>Ours:</HI> That thereby he struck a Terror into our Enemies: And tho' our People were so eager of Landing, they were ready to quarrel to get into the Boats, and the Surf ran high; yet all our Army landed safely, without oversetting a Boat or loosing a Man.</P>
<P N="8">8. That He mov'd them to improve the Time and forthwith march up <HI>Five Miles,</HI> thro' a rocky &amp; boggy Country, and en|close the City. That in the <HI>following Night</HI> he led some of our Soldiers, thro' strange Places to the <HI>Storehouses</HI> near the <HI>Grand Battery,</HI> which was strongly fortified with Walls and Ditches, and at each End a very thick Bomb-proof Tower: That the Storehouses full of combustible Matter, being <HI>set on Fire,</HI> burnt &amp; flash'd in a horrible Manner, and in the Night en|creas'd the Enemies Terror: That the <HI>Wind</HI> also bearing a pro|digious black Smoke upon them, in which expecting our Army to enter, they were every Soul frighted out of it into the City: And that in the <HI>Morning,</HI> but 13 of our Men observing there was neither Flag flying, nor Chimney smoaking, nor Person appearing, but the Gates open, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ventur'd in and took Possession.</P>
<P N="9">9. That yet the Enemy aware of their fatal Error, soon after came with Forces in many <HI>Shallowaes</HI> to <HI>recover</HI> it: But 8 of the 13 going out of the Battery and meeting with about 8 more of our Friends, run to the Water Side, and so plied the Boats with Small Arms, as damp'd and hinder'd them, 'till seeing more of our Forces coming, the Boats turn'd back to the Town again: And if they had come but <HI>one Hour</HI> soon|er, they had regain'd the Battery before we found it deserted. And thus this strong Fortress of 32 great <HI>Cannon,</HI> 30 of them 42 Pounders, which might alone have maintain'd itself against all our Army, the LORD deliver'd into our Hands, without the Loss of a Man, or Shot of a Gun, and before we de|manded it: Whereby he at once fav'd us both Time, Toil and Blood, and surprizingly gave us a great Power over the Har|bour, as well as so many of the largest of the Enemies <HI>Can|non,</HI> with a great Number of their own <HI>Balls</HI> and <HI>Bombs</HI> to improve against them.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="29" REF="005681_0027_1026BBD72CBD75F0">
10. That our Army was preserv'd from the dangerous <HI>In|fection:</HI> And tho' being open to the Air, Fogs and Dews, upon the Melting of the Ice, in a raw Climate and Season of the Year, the Camp-<HI>Dysentry</HI> seized many; yet some of our Physicians in their Letters signified, that it look'd almost mi|raculous, they should so soon and generally, without Means, recover.</P>
<P N="11">11. That they should be inspir'd with wondrous <HI>Courage, Eagerness, Activity</HI> and unfainting <HI>Strength:</HI> Be supported under their extraordinary and constant Toils, Fatigues and Labours, in carrying Stores, drawing Cannon over Hills and Valleys, among Rocks and thro' Morasses, up to the Middle in Mire; and in digging Trenches, raising Batteries, firing Shot and Bombs almost incessantly both Day and Night a|gainst the City: And that GOD so speedily <HI>taught their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight,</HI> as presently to throw them with great Exactness, and do continual Execution among our Enemies; dismounting their Cannon, heating down their Houses, Gates, Walls, Flankers, and greatly distressing them.</P>
<P N="12">12. That when a new 64 <HI>Gun Ship</HI> from <HI>France</HI> with near 600 Men, and great Quantities of Arms and Stores, came so near the Mouth of their Harbour and before a fair Wind, that <HI>two Hours</HI> more would have given her Entrance; she was happily discover'd by some of our smaller Ships, who led her along to the larger and soon made her Strike: And tho' by the Fog in the Night they lost her, yet in the Morn|ing they happily recover'd her; to the growing Discourage|ment of the Besieged, and our encreasing Strength and Benefit.</P>
<P>That tho' to show our <HI>Dependance</HI> on GOD continually, He was pleas'd to suffer the barbarous <HI>Indians, twice</HI> to sur|prize and murther some of our People; yet in several <HI>Land|Encounters</HI> both with <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> in divers Parts of the Island, He was pleas'd to give us the Victory.</P>
<P>That by Means of the extraordinary quick Dispatch of a <HI>Messenger,</HI> our <HI>Governour</HI> in <HI>February</HI> sent to the KING for naval Help; GOD was pleas'd to send so many <HI>Men of War</HI> successively, as by the 12th of <HI>June,</HI> with the 64 Gun Prize, and those who were there before, to amount to <HI>Eleven;</HI> to
<PB N="30" REF="005681_0028_1026BBD8E6CF8048">
the sinking Fear of the Enemy, and the rising Joy of our Fleet and Army; as also to preserve a happy <HI>Harmony</HI> between <HI>our various Officers.</HI></P>
<P>That tho' GOD was pleas'd to humble us in defeating our <HI>Attack</HI> in the <HI>Night</HI> on their strong <HI>Island Fort;</HI> yet He hap|pily <HI>guided</HI> and with surprizing Strength, Agility and Quick|ness <HI>helped</HI> us to hoist up some of the heaviest <HI>Cannon</HI> and <HI>Mortars</HI> on the <HI>Light House Cliff,</HI> which overlook'd <HI>that Fort</HI> in which they trusted to hinder our entering into their Har|bour: And then <HI>assisted</HI> in casting our <HI>Bombs</HI> so exactly, as after the <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> first, to throw in <HI>every One</HI> of the rest, and do such Execution as quickly beat them out of this strong Hold they tho't impregnable, and frighten the <HI>City</HI> to a <HI>quiet Surrender.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD shou'd move 'em to it in <HI>that critical Moment,</HI> when the <HI>Navy</HI> and <HI>Army</HI> had just agreed on a <HI>general,</HI> despe|rate and fierce <HI>Assault</HI> both by <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Water;</HI> which was like to be exceeding bloody and of doubtful Consequence: For upon the Capitulation, when our Forces enter'd the City and came to view the inward State of its Fortifications; they were amazed to see their extraordinary Strength and Device, and how we had like to have lost the Limbs and Lives of a <HI>Multitude,</HI> if not have been all destroy'd.</P>
<P>That in all our close and constant Assaults and Skirmishes, some of our Batteries being within <HI>Pistol Shot</HI> of the City, and receiving such a vast Number of <HI>Balls</HI> and <HI>Bombs</HI> almost continually by Day and by Night, we should not have above a <HI>Hundred slain;</HI> in so raw a Climate and Season, and under such Fatigues, not loose above a <HI>Hundred</HI> more by <HI>Sickness;</HI> and of so many <HI>Vessels</HI> transporting and cruizing, in so many Storms in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> loose but <HI>One;</HI> tho' this a <HI>Cruizer</HI> of a <HI>Hundred Men,</HI> supposed to be overset, is a grievous Loss.</P>
<P>That in the Time of the <HI>Siege,</HI> there were many other surprizing Events in our Favour&mdash;Such as <HI>timely Supplies</HI> to our Army, either by Transports or Prizes, as we were near to want them&mdash;That the very <HI>Balls</HI> from our Enemies <HI>Can|non</HI> were of no small Service, being as fast almost as they fell, catch'd up and put into <HI>Ours,</HI> and return'd with Advantage
<PB N="31" REF="005681_0029_1026BBDA98C752A0">
&mdash;That digging a <HI>Trench</HI> to protect our Men, and meeting a <HI>Rock</HI> in the Way we could not remove; just as we left it, a <HI>Bomb</HI> from the Enemy came down in the most suitable Spot, and without any Harm remov'd it for us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That from the Army's leaving <HI>Canso, April</HI> 29, to their land|ing <HI>April</HI> 30, and during all the <HI>Siege,</HI> there should be such a con|tinual Series of <HI>fair Weather,</HI> as was never known, at that Time of the Year, in the Place before, 'till their <HI>entering</HI> into the <HI>City, June</HI> 17; and then the Clouds to gather Blackness and pour down Rains for <HI>Ten Days</HI> together: Which would have spoil'd our Batteries, fill'd our Trenches, and greatly hinder'd and dis|abled us!&mdash;It seem'd to close the Scenes of Wonder!&mdash;As if the sovereign GOD would suspend the hurtful Opera|tions of Nature, 'till he had quite accomplish'd his <HI>great De|sign,</HI> deliver'd the Fortress into our Hands, and led us into a Place of Shelter.</P>
<P>In the <HI>mean while,</HI> it is also remarkable, that the <HI>North American</HI> Coasts have been unmolested by both the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish West India Privateers,</HI> 'till this great Affair was ended. And that by Means of <HI>Du Vivier'</HI>s Project of taking <HI>Annapolis</HI> in the <HI>Spring</HI> or <HI>Summer,</HI> both our <HI>French and Indian Enemies</HI> have been all this Time diverted from our exposed <HI>inland Bor|ders;</HI> they being drawn to <HI>Menis,</HI> and to make a transient Show at <HI>Annapolis:</HI> So he was guided into this mischievous but fruitless Project, and to go even to <HI>France,</HI> to promote our Safety, and give us an unmolested Season for the taking of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, That tho' our GOVERNOUR, our GENERAL COURT, the <HI>Council of War,</HI> the <HI>General,</HI> the <HI>Commodore,</HI> the <HI>Officers</HI> and <HI>Soldiers,</HI> both by <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Sea,</HI> have display'd a wonderous Wisdom, Zeal, Courage, Resolution, Diligence, and unwearied Application; yet they have the eminent Ho|nour in receiving these from GOD, and in his employing them to atchieve and bring about such a glorious and happy <HI>Addi|tion</HI> to the <HI>British</HI> Crown and Empire: Nor without <HI>his num|berless other Directions</HI> wou'd all their Skill, Care, Toil and Diligence, have availed any thing: And to HIM be therefore all the Glory. For the infinitely inferiour Brightness sparkling in <HI>them,</HI> is wholly deriv'd from HIM, both by his original and
<PB N="32" REF="005681_0030_1026BBDC61B472D0">
continual Influence; like the Glitters of <HI>Diamonds</HI> from the Morning <HI>Sun,</HI> and when He wholly hides his Light, they va|nish. And yet the brillant Diamonds are more to be valued than unshining Pebbles.</P>
<P>And thus have we seen <HI>this Passage</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> in a re|markable Manner <HI>exemplified</HI> in the <HI>present Day.</HI></P>
<P>And now who can in common Reason deny a <HI>particular Providence</HI> in this great Affair? Who can in Reason imagine that such a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>various</HI> and <HI>contrary</HI> running <HI>Wheels,</HI> both of <HI>material Causes</HI> and <HI>spontaneous Agents,</HI> shou'd all be made to work together, and in the midst of Thousands of Difficulties and Contingencies, in the happiest Seasons coin|cide, to accomplish <HI>this</HI> GREAT EVENT; without a SU|PREAM <HI>Contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">r, Mover</HI> and <HI>Director?</HI> We may a thou|sand Times more consistently apprehend the <HI>most curious En|gine</HI> in the World to be made without Design, and to work without a moving Power.</P>
<P>Yea, Those who own not <HI>These</HI> to be the <HI>Operations</HI> of GOD, as a wise, sovereign, free and actual Ruler among Men and Elements; must not only deny the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> but even the very <HI>Foundations</HI> of all Religion, or Adoration of this supream Governour. For they must deny there is any Need, or Duty, or Wisdom, of fearing Him, or praying to Him, or hoping on Him in any Emergencies; or of acknowledging, admiring, praising, loving, or thanking Him, for the <HI>greatest</HI> and <HI>most marvellous Salvations.</HI></P>
<P>But as for <HI>Us</HI>&mdash;In the <HI>Name</HI> of GOD, <HI>our</HI> GOD in CHRIST, yea in the <HI>Name</HI> of the SON of GOD, as supream Lord and Ruler of Heaven and Earth, of Men, Angels, and Elements, we lifted up our Banners: To <HI>Him</HI> we looked and prayed: In <HI>Him</HI> we put our Trust and sought: And now, <HI>He</HI> has heard and prosper'd, to <HI>Him</HI> we will ascribe <HI>the Praise.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Instruments</HI> or <HI>Means</HI> He us'd, we will bless Him for them; we see them form'd, endow'd, excited by Him; we see them in his mighty and all-active Hands, deriving Strength and Guidance from Him, and employ'd continually to fulfill his Pleasure. We will own, the Work is his in the
<PB N="33" REF="005681_0031_1026BBE092B86B60">
highest Sense: It was all comprehended in his sovereign View, Design and Providence; begun, carried on, accomplish'd by his all-governing Wisdom, Power and Efficacy; and the whole together is marvellous in every serious Eye.</P>
<P>When the Tydings came of surrendring the City,<Q>we were like Them that dream: Our Mouth was fill'd with Laughter, and our Tongue with singing: Even the Hea|then said, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>hath done great Things for them;</HI> and We&mdash;<HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory: Our GOD hath done whatsoever he pleased: The LORD hath been mindful of us: And we will bless the LORD, from this Time forth &amp; for ever. Thine O LORD is the Greatness, &amp; the Power, &amp; the Glory, &amp; the Victory, and the Majesty: For all that is in the Heaven and in the Earth is thine; thine is the Kingdom O LORD, and thou art exalted as Head above all: Both Riches and Honour come of Thee, and Thou reignest over all, and in thine Hand is Power and Might; and in thine Hand it is to make Great, and to give Strength to all: Now there|fore OUR GOD, we thank Thee and praise thy glorious Name. Give Thanks to the LORD, call on his Name, make known his Deeds among the People: Sing unto Him, sing Psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous Works: Declare his Glory among the Heathen, his marvellous Works among all Nations.</Q></P>
<P>O that when we have <HI>sang his Praise,</HI> we may not ungrate|fully <HI>forget his Works,</HI> or return to <HI>Sin;</HI> which is to rob Him of his deserved Glory and fly in the Face of our great Preser|ver and Benefactor: It is the vilest Degree of Ingratitude and provoking Baseness: It is to fight against HIM, who has been marvellously fighting for <HI>us,</HI> and given us a wonderous Series of great Salvations. Yea, this will be the dangerous Way to move HIM to turn <HI>our Enemy;</HI> to change the Course of his slighted Dispensations, and give <HI>the Place</HI> into our Ad|versaries Hands again, with a more dreadful and mischievous Increase of Power than ever, to punish us. And the Sins of <HI>Drunkenness, Profanation</HI> of the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Day</HI> of GOD, <HI>Un|cleanness, Injustice, Oppression, Contempt</HI> of CHRIST, &amp; <HI>Opposition</HI> to the <HI>Purity, Power</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>his holy Religion;</HI> are some
<PB N="34" REF="005681_0032_1026BBE21C193CC0">
of the highest and most dangerous Provocations and Prepara|tives to ruinous Judgments.</P>
<P>Yea, <HI>distinguishing Appearances</HI> of GOD to save and prosper us, are <HI>distinguishing Obligations,</HI> not only to <HI>distinguishing De|grees</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> but also to <HI>distinguishing Degrees</HI> of <HI>Piety:</HI> i. e. of active Gratitude and Love to GOD, of per|petual Contrivances and Labours to promote his Glory and holy Kingdom in Ourselves and Others, and to a constant Life of Service to His Cause and People. And as the <HI>Failure</HI> of this, will not be a rendering to Him according to his signal Benefits, but a most <HI>ungrateful</HI> Treatment of Him; <HI>his Eyes</HI> are always on us, to observe us <HI>now,</HI> and to judge and Re|compence us <HI>Here</HI> or <HI>Hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>But let us rejoice, not only in <HI>our own Salvation,</HI> the Salvation of <HI>all our Colonies,</HI> and some of the most important Branches of the <HI>British Trade;</HI>&mdash;But let our Joy rise higher, that hereby a <HI>great Support</HI> of <HI>Antichristian</HI> Power is taken away, and the <HI>visible Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST enlarged, Methinks, when the southern <HI>Gates</HI> of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> were opened, and our Army with their Banners were marching in; <HI>the Gates were lifted up&mdash;the Gates were lifted up&mdash;and the</HI> KING <HI>of</HI> GLORY went in with them. Even the SON of GOD, the LORD of Hosts, the LORD strong and mighty in Battle&mdash;having gain'd the Conquest, he rode in in Triumph and took Possession. He set up his Standard, proclaim'd his Gospel of Peace, the Glad Tydings of Salvation, open'd the Prisons, redeem'd his Captives, and began to receive his grateful Incense of pure Adorations. O that There, in Purity of Worship, Doctrine and Conversation, in the Power of his Grace and in the Glory of his Holiness, He may reign and shine to all the Islands round about, as long as the Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>And as 'twas one of the chief Disgraces of Queen ANNE'S Reign, to resign <HI>this Island</HI> to the <HI>French;</HI> it is happily one of the Glories of King GEORGE <HI>the Second'</HI>s, to recover it to the <HI>British</HI> Empire. O that it may remain united thereto for ever, and so perpetuate the Glory. O that under the Influence of <HI>British Liberties,</HI> in a <HI>happy Constitution</HI> of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> and the DIVINE Care &amp; Blessing, even <HI>Louishourg</HI> itself, with <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and all <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> may revive and flourish.
<PB N="35" REF="005681_0033_1026BBE3AB079448">
May they have religious, wise and generous <HI>Governours,</HI> that may be as <HI>nursing Fathers</HI> to them; encourage them in Piety, Virtue and good Order, promote their Trade, and protect them in their Properties and Liberties.</P>
<P>Lastly, may this happy Conquest be the <HI>dawning Earnest</HI> of our DIVINE REDEEMER'S carrying on his Triumphs thro' the <HI>Northern Regions;</HI> 'till He extends his Empire from the <HI>Eastern</HI> to the <HI>Western Sea,</HI> and from the River of <HI>Canada</HI> to the Ends of <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;THEN from the uttermost Parts of the Earth shall be heard <HI>Songs,</HI> even Glory to the righteous GOD: They shall lift up their Voice, they shall sing for the Majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the Sea; they shall glorify the LORD in the Woods and Valleys, on the Lakes and Rivers, in the Mountains, in the Islands: And the Hea|vens and the Earth shall be filled with his Glory, and eccho with his Praise.</P>
