<HEAD>To the Reader</HEAD>
<P>The occasion of my undertaking what is here presen|ted, was a letter which I received from a worthy person, who upon the perusal of that <HI>brief historical Account</HI> of the war with the Indians in <HI>New England,</HI> published the last summer, importuned me to write the story of the <HI>Pequot War;</HI> Taking his motion into consideration, it came into my thoughts, that it would be a service and benefit for po|sterity, if all other general troubles which have happened by the <HI>Heathen</HI>in this land, were recorded and made known; &amp; the rather, in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as to those <HI>first motions and commotions</HI> there are very few that know any thing of them. Wherefore I set my self to make enquiry into those matters, and shall for the sa|tisfaction of the <HI>Reader,</HI> give him an account where and from whence I obtained, what light and information touching these <HI>Indian troubles,</HI> I have been any wayes able to arrive unto.</P>
<P>Such Books as I had by me, that relate any thing of these affaires I have been willing to revolve. e.g. <HI>Johannes de Laet</HI> his <HI>Description of America,</HI> written in Latin; Also several of Cpt. <HI>Smith</HI> his books; And <HI>a relation of the discovery of New England,</HI> published by the President and Council of <HI>New England.</HI> Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1622. And the <HI>Relation or journal of the first plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ers in Plymouth</HI> together with several letters which some of them wrote to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> soon after their first coming into this countrey&punc; and Mr. <HI>Winstow</HI> (then whom hardly any one that hath deserved more e|minently from New England) his <HI>good news from New England,</HI>
<PB REF="000238_0003_0FA36DFC09CBFEE0">
published Anno 1624. which relations are in the hands of but few in this countrey, &amp; therefore I have been the larger in excerping things out of them. They are epitomized in <HI>Purchase</HI> his <HI>Pil|grims</HI> lib. 10. who declares that he had by him a description of the vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">age made by Capt. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> to <HI>Sag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dehoc,</HI> and the writ|ten journals of Mr. <HI>Ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igh Gilbert,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Harly,</HI> &amp; Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Hobson,</HI> who were in this land before any English plantation was setled therein. I doubt not but in those scripts a more full and particular account is given, of the <HI>first concerns</HI> with the <HI>In|dians</HI> here. But I could not come by the fight of them, nor do I know certainly whether those things are extant. I have also perused Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> narration of original undertak|ings here. Moreover I have read a large Manuscript of Gover|nour <HI>Bradfords</HI> (written with his own hand&punc;) being expressive of what the <HI>first planters</HI> in this countrey met with, whether from the <HI>Heathen</HI> or otherwise, from the year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0&punc; to the year 1647. As for the <HI>Peq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot troubles,</HI> the world is beholding to the industry of Mr. <HI>John Allyn</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> (as is in the subsequent <HI>Relation</HI> acknowledged) for what is thus made publick, respect|ing the great Commotions which then happened. Only I have been willing to add some particulars out of a <HI>manuscipt narrative</HI> of the <HI>Pequot war,</HI> which I lately met with in Reverend Mr. <HI>Da|venports</HI> library, as also what Mr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Morton</HI> (out of Mr. <HI>Bradfords</HI> manuscript) hath heretofore noted. Touching the <HI>Narragansets&punc;</HI> I have searched the publick Records of the Colonyes, and from thence exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rped the substance of what as here related, as to former troubles from them, or by their means procured. The <HI>Relation</HI> concerning <HI>Alexander</HI> and his brother <HI>Philip,</HI> wherewith this <HI>Narrative</HI> is concluded, I recei|ved from the present Honourable Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> (who succeeds his blessed Father, as in place, so in spirit) and from the faithful <HI>Secretary</HI> of that Colony.

<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE FIRST TROUBLES IN New-England By reason of the INDANS there</HEAD>
<P>IT is now above seventy years, since that Part of this Continent which is known by the name of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND,</HI> was disco|vered, and possession thereof taken by the English. No man that hath made it his Concern to be acquainted with things of this na|ture can be ignorant, that the <HI>Northern,</HI> (or to us <HI>Northeast</HI>) parts of this Land were the first wherein were English Inhabitants; whence it was for some years known by the name of <HI>the Northern Planta|tion,</HI> until such time as King <HI>Charles</HI> the first (then Prince of Wales) gave it the name of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>in Anno</HI> 1602. and in the year following, some of our Countrey|men made notable discoveryes in that Land which lyeth North and by east of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between the degrees of 43&punc; &amp; 45. Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>Four or five years after this that noble Lord, Sr. <HI>John Popham</HI> (then Lord chief Justice) sent ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a ship into these parts to make further disco|very, who arriving at the place designed, quickly returned, and made such a report of what they had seen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s did greatly animate the Adventurers to go on with their begun undertaking; whereupon in Anno 1607. A Gen|tleman
<PB N="2" REF="000238_0007_0FA36DFF07EB1D68">
whose name was <HI>Popham</HI> was sent into these Coasts, with two ships and an hundred Land-men, and Ordnance, and other things necessary for their sustentation and defence, in order to the making way for the settle|ment of a F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">antation. But that noble Lord being taken out of the world by sudden death, also the Planters here meeting with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad disasters (for in the depth of winter, their lodgings and stores were burnt, and Capt. <HI>Pop|hom</HI> dyed amongst them) when the next year a vessel arrived bringing the news of the Lord <HI>Pophom'</HI>s death, the whole company of the English re|solved upon a return home, which proved the death of the English Plan|tation, at that time designed in these parts of the world. Only Sr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r. Popham</HI> (son to the Lord chief Justice) sent diverse time&punc; to those coasts for trade and Fishing.</P>
<P>As yet there was not (so far as I can learn) any disturbance from the <HI>In|dians,</HI> then the only Natives of this Land. But not long after this, an un|worthy Ship-Master whose name was <HI>Hunt,</HI> being sent forth into these Coasts on the account of the Fishing trade, after he had made his dispatch and was ready to sail, (under pretence of trucking with them) enticed In|dians into his vessel, they in confidence of his honesty went aboard, to the number of twenty from <HI>Patu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> since called <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and seven from <HI>Nosset</HI> (now known by the name of <HI>Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">am</HI>) these did this <HI>Hunt</HI> seize upon, stowed them under hatches, and carried them to the streights of <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bral|tar,</HI> and there did he sell as many as he could of them for 20<HI>l.</HI> a man, un|till it was known whence they came; for then the Friars in those parts took away the rest of them, that so they might nurture them in the Popish Re|ligion. The pernicious and avaritious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elony of this Ship-Master, in stealing and selling the <HI>Indians</HI> to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> as hath been expressed, laid the foundation to great <HI>troubles</HI> which did after that befall the En|glish, especially in the <HI>North-east</HI> parts of this Land. Yea that inhu|mane and barbarous Fact was the unhappy occasion of the loss of many a mans estate and life, which the Barbarians in those beginning times did from thence seek to destroy.</P>
<P>For when the Gentlemen Adventurers did again dispatch a vessel hither commanded by Capt. <HI>Hobson</HI> in order to erecting a Plantation and setling a Trade with the Natives here, <HI>Hunt'</HI>s forementioned scandal, had caused the Indians to contract such a mortal hatred against all men of the English Nation, that it was no small difficulty to settle any where within their Ter|ritoryes, And whereas there were two Indians called <HI>Epenow</HI> and <HI>Ma|naw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> who having been carried out of these parts of the world into <HI>Eng|land.</HI> had learned to speak English, that were returned in <HI>Hobsons</HI> vessel, as hoping they might be serviceable toward the design on foot, it
<PB N="3" REF="000238_0008_0FA36DFFC80160A0">
fell out otherwise, since being exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">perated by what <HI>Hunt</HI> had done, they contrived with their Country-men how to be revenged upon the English. <HI>Mana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et</HI> dyed within a short time after the ships arrival. <HI>Epenow</HI> se|cretly plotted to free himself out of the English hands, which he effected though with great hazard to himself and other <HI>Salvages</HI> that were his fel|low <HI>Conspirators,</HI> which came to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s after this manner.</P>
<P>Upon the Ships arrival, many of the Indians (some of them being <HI>Epe|nows</HI> kinsmen) came aboard and were kindly entertained by the Captain; at their departure they promised to return the next day, and bring some Trade with them. <HI>Epenow</HI> had not liberty granted him to go on shear, only much discourse (and probably a contrivement for his escape) was be|tween him and the other Indians in the vessel, which no body but them|selves could understand. The Indians returned at the time appointed with twenty <HI>Canoos,</HI> but were shy of coming aboard. <HI>Epenow</HI> cunningly called to them as if if he would have them come into the vessel, to trade, and suddenly did himself leap overboard: He was no sooner in the wa|ter, but me Indians sent a shower of arrows into the vessel, and came des|perately near to the ship, and (in despight of all the English Musketiers aboard) went away with their Country-man <HI>Epenow.</HI></P>
<P>Diverse of the Indians were then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n by the English, and the Master of the English vessel, and several of the Company wounded by the Indians.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Captain and the whole company were discouraged, and returned to England, bringing nothing back with them but the news of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad success, and that there was a <HI>War</HI> broke out between the <HI>En|glish</HI> and the <HI>Indians.</HI> The time when these troubles hapned, is contro|verted more then the things themselves. <HI>Johannes de Laet</HI> in his <HI>descrip|tion India Occidentalis,</HI> writeth that it was between the years 1608 &amp; 1615 So doth <HI>Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hase.</HI> Sr. <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> relates that he sent Capt. <HI>Hob|son</HI> into these parts in Anno 1614, and what <HI>Hunt</HI> did was before that, as being the Grand procuring Cause of the Broyle between the English and the Indians, which first began in that year.</P>
<P>After these things another vessel was sent into these <HI>Northern</HI> parts un|der the Command of Capt. <HI>Rocraft,</HI> he designed to winter there, but some of his own ships Company conspired against him, intending his death, he having secret intelligence of this plot against his life, held his peace un|till the day was come wherein the intended mischief was to be put in exe|cution, then unexpectedly apprehended the Conspirators; he was loth himself to put any to death, though they were worthy of it. But there|fore he resolved to leave them in the Wilderness, not knowing but they might haply discover something which might be advantageous.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000238_0009_0FA36E00D91CF480">
Accordingly he furnished them with ammunition, and some victuals for their present subsistence, and turned them ashore to <HI>Sacode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ck,</HI>himself with the rest of his Company departing to <HI>Virginia.</HI> Those English Mu|tineers got over to the Island of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">heg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI>three leagues from the Main, where they kept themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> safe from the Fury of exasperated Indians, un|til the next Spring, when a vessel that came on the Coast on a Fishing voy|age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound them all (except one person that died of sickness in this inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m) alive, and carried them away back for England.</P>
<P>Not many years after this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in Anno.1619 a Gentleman whose name was <HI>Darmer</HI> was sent to prosecute the design of plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and setling a Trade in <HI>New-England,</HI> and to endeavour that a right understanding of matters between the Indians and the English might be accomplished.</P>
<P>He therefore brought with him an Indian called <HI>Squantum,</HI> who was one of those that <HI>Hunt</HI> had treacherously carried away from <HI>Patuxet,</HI> but was bought by an English Merchant, and lived some time with Mr. <HI>Slany</HI> a Gentleman in <HI>Cornhil,</HI> until he could speak broken English, and after that at <HI>New found-land,</HI> where Capt. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">son</HI> was then Governour, who was willing that Mr. <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> should take <HI>Squantum</HI> with him to <HI>New-England.</HI> Upon his arrival here, he told his Countreymen very strange storyes, giving them to understand what kind usage he had met with a|mong the English where he had been, and how much the wicked Fact of that covetous <HI>Hunt</HI> was condemned, so that many of them began to con|verse with, and become friendly toward the English, and Mr. <HI>Darmer</HI> conceited that he and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uantum</HI> had made a firm peace between the Na|tions. But, <HI>manet alta m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nte repostum</HI>&mdash;Indians are not wont to forget injuries, when once they have sustained any: so did that Gentleman find it to his after sorrow: For being near the place where <HI>Hunt</HI> had for|merly betrayed the Indians abcard his vessel, they treacherously set upon him, and gave him fourteen wounds, so that he had much adoe to escape with his life, And though he got to <HI>Virginia</HI> after this, some write that he never recovered of those wounds which he received o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Nausi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Indians.

The first land they made was that of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Novemb. 9. where they came to an Anchor, and went on shore, Novemb. 11. Perceiving the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mmodiousness of that place for planting, they resolved to seek out, for another that might be more accommodate. But their Shallop not being in trimm to be sent out upon discovery, some were desirous to improve the time, in making what searches they could upon the land thereabout.</P>
<P>Novemb. 5. Sixteen men well armed were set on shore under the conduct of Capt. <HI>Miles Standish.</HI> After they had gone about a mile near the shoar, they descryed five or six Indians, who like wild creatures ran away from them at the first sight, they followed them by the trace of their footings, about ten miles, til night came on, but could not come to any speech with them.</P>
<P>At last they met with a kettle, wherein was Indian corn, which after much consultation they seized upon, resolving that if they could come to speak with Indians, they would return them their Kettel, and give them full satisfaction for their corn, which they intended for planting, not knowing how else to be supplyed. So did they return the next day, but lost themselves awhile in the woods, and as they were wandring up &amp; down, they hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to espy a small tree that was bowed down, and some Acorns strewed underneath, whilst they were viewing of it, and wonder|ing what it should mean, it gave a sudden jerk, whereby one of the Com|pany was caught up by the leg, it being an Indian Deer-trap; the rest loos|ed him, and at last they found their way to the ship again.</P>
<P>After this, their Shallop being fitted for the purpose, they went a coast|ing
<PB N="6" REF="000238_0011_0FA36E02093E7868">
upon discovery, but of some dayes could meet with no Indians. Al|beit they found old deserted Indian Forts, and more of their corn and baskets, and a bottle of oyle which doubtless some how was brought out of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>About the tenth of December, they discerned the track of Indian feet upon the sand, and followed it, till they perceived where it struck up in|to the woods, at last they light upon an Indian path, which led them a great way up into the woods, and saw where there had been corn planted, and found Indian gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es &amp;c. but no man appeared.</P>
<P>So they returned to their Shallop, and some watching, others betook themselves to their rest. But in the night they were alarmed by the Sen|tinels crying <HI>Arm, Arm,</HI> supposing Indians to be near them. They heard a most hideous howling, but one in the Company perswaded the rest, that it was the noyse of wolves and Foxes, which used (as he said) to make such a noise in <HI>New found<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> where he had been, two gunns were shot off, at which the noise ceased.</P>
<P>But betimes in the morning, on a sudden they heard the same voices a|gain, and one of the company cryed <HI>Indians&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and immediate|ly arrowes came pouring in upon them. This barbarous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was amazing to the English, but that which did most of all terrine was the hor|rid cry of those Salvages, whose note was after this manner, <HI>Woach woach ha ha <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">och woach.</HI> A stout Indian who was thought to be their Captain, standing behind a tree let fly his arrows apace, and stood three shotts of a musket, untill one took full aim at him, and (as tis supposed sorely wounded him, upon which he gave an extraordinary shriek, and went a|way, and all the other Indians fled with him. Providence so ordered, as that none of the English received any hurt, though afterwards they ga|thered up eighteen arrows, (and many more were shot at them) some whereof were headed with brass, others with Harts-horn, others with Eagles Claws, and sundry of the English had their coats shot through &amp; through.</P>
<P>Decemb. 19. The English-landed and resolved to endeavour the setling of a plantation, at that place which is now called <HI>Plymouth.</HI> No indians there as yet appeared to give them any disturbance: Yea though some were sent out to seek after them, they could find none.</P>
<P>There were not many dayes after this, two Englishmen who being by the side of a pond, hapned to see a Deer, and having Dogs with them, they pursued the Deer until such time as they lost themselves in the woods, where they were forced to lodge that night, and were terrified with the yelling (as it seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of two <HI>Lions,</HI> who roared exceedingly, and
<PB N="7" REF="000238_0012_0FA36E02CA36D288">
a third that they thought was very neer them: they betook themselves to a tree, purposing if the Lions should come, to climb that for their securi|ty; but they saw none. The next day they perceived that Indians had made fires thereabouts, but it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they met not with any until they came home, being than unarmed and not fit for encounter with such Ene|mies.</P>
<P>Now it was that a special providence of another nature hapned: For the English having built an house in <HI> Plimouth,</HI> a spark of fire flying into the thatch, it was instantly burnt down: Mr. <HI>Carver</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> were then sick, yet if they had not risen with good speed, they had been blown up with powder. The house was full of beds as they could lye one by another, and their muskets charged, yet (through the good pro|vidence of God, no hurt done.</P>
<P>Febr. 16. An English-man that was gone forth upon a fowling design, espyed twelve Indians marching toward the English plantation, and heard the noise of many more not far off, he lay close untill they were gone by, and then with all speed returned home and gave the alarm, but no Indians followed, only they took away the tools of those English, that had been at work in the woods.</P>
<P>The next day two Indians presented themselves on the top of an hill; two English went out to parly with them, but they ran away, and the noise of a multitude of them was heard on the other side of the hill.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>March</HI> an Indian called <HI>Samoset</HI> came boldly a|long the houses, which were newly built in <HI>Plimouth</HI> and to their great a|mazement, spake to them in English, saying, <HI>Welcome Englishmen;</HI> This In|dian was a <HI>Sagamore</HI> belonging to the <HI>Northern parts,</HI> about <HI>Monhiggen,</HI> where he had often conversed with English Fishermen, and had learned to speak broken English; Hee was the first Indian that they of Plymouth had opportunity to discourse with. Hee could tel them of the <HI>Huggery</HI> (as he called it) i. e. <HI>Fight,</HI> which the English had with the <HI>Nausset</HI> Indians; and that the name of that place was called <HI>Patuxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</HI> where a multitude of In|dians had formerly lived, but they were all dead of the plague which had been there a few years before the English came. This <HI>Samoset</HI> within a few dayes after his departure returned again, and brought <HI>Squantum</HI> (whom that wicked <HI>Hunt</HI> had stolen away and sold for a slave) along with him; which <HI>Squantum</HI> was born in that place. <HI>Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t</HI> and <HI>Squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntum</HI> made it their business to bring the English into acquaintance with the next neigh|bouring Indians: wherefore they undertook to bring <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ssas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who began the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the English <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 24. 1075) to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat with the English at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>

Accordingly, March 22. <HI>Massasoit</HI> with his brother <HI>Quadeguina</HI> came accompanied with about sixty of his men; and an agreement of peace be|tween the English and Indians was then concluded on. This peace was in more respects then one singularly advantagious to the English, whilst they were thus but few in number, and strangers in this land.</P>
<P>And as for the reasons inducing <HI>Massa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> to this accord with the En|glish, there were several things that prevailed with him thereunto; For <HI>Squantum</HI> had told him what a great Prince King <HI>James</HI> was, and how well he would take it if his Subjects were kindly entertained, and how ill if otherwise, and how easy it was for him to send over ships and men e|nough to destroy <HI>Massasoit</HI> and all his people. At that time also there was enmity between <HI>Massasoit,</HI> and the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> so that he hoped the English might be a defence to him against them. Thus did the feud which was kindled amongst the Indians one against another, advantage the poor Church in Plymouth. <HI>Sic Canes lingunt ulcera Lazari.</HI> Moreover the consideration of the Guns, and other warlike Weapons, which ours brought with them, was terrible to the Indians, yet they had more formidable apprehensions thereof, then there was real cause for: They imagined that the English could by their great Guns cause the trees to fall down and kill the Indians. Furthermore <HI>Squantum</HI> did wickedly possess them with one delusion about the English, which had dismal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m|pressions upon the minds of these ignorant Barbarians; For whereas the plague (a disease which was never known in this land either before or since) had newly been raging amongst them, whereby many of their towns were totally depopulated, and desolated: he made them beleive that the English kept the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue in a place under ground, and that they could let it loose upon the Indians when they would. An Indian called <HI>Hob|bom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck</HI> being one of <HI>Massaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> Counsellors, observing in one of the Eng|lish houses a kind of a Cellar, where some barrels of powder were be|stowed, enquired of <HI>Squantum</HI> what that was, To whom he replyed, that there the English kept the plague that he told them of, which they could let loose upon Indians at pleasure. When this <HI>Hobbomock</HI> became acquainted with the English, he seriously asked them whether they had any such power, they answered him truly that they had not, but withall added that the God whom they served had power to send that or any o|ther disease upon those that should doe any wrong to his people. The Consideration of that also, was&punc; some terror to the Indians.</P>
<P>In the Moneth of <HI>June</HI> 10 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The English sent Messengers with a Pre|sent to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> By the way they were accos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d with seve|ral of the Indians, who having them at an Advantage as they passed

through a River, were ready to shoot at them: Only having Indian Guides and Interpreters in their Company, who gave them to under|stand that they were friends, no hurt was done. Being come to <HI>Massa|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it,</HI> they presented him with a red Cotton Coat, whereon was some Lace, this he accepted with great thankfulness, <HI>and having put it on</HI> (saith my Author) <HI>He was not a little proud to behold himselfe, and his men also to behold their King so bravely attired.</HI> He then promised to continue in amity with the English, and to take care that his men should not be Injurious.</P>
<P>About this time it was that an English lad (one <HI>John Billington</HI>) lost himselfe in the woods, living five days upon Berries untill he fel into the hands of the Indians. Some were (upon <HI>Massasoits</HI> Information) sent to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> to seek after him, when they came thither the Indians flocked together, many not having seen Englishmen before: Amongst others there was an old woman, judged to be an hundred years old, who when she saw the English fel into an extream passion of bitter wee ping, the reason whereof being demanded, answer was made, that she had three sons once living in that place, but they were all stolen away by that <HI>Hunt</HI> (before mentioned) and now she had no more left to re|leeve her in her old age: The English were much grieved to see the poor Creature in such a passion, but telling her that it was only one wicked man who did that Fact, and that they abhorred it, and withal giving her some trifles, she was satisfied. In fine the English lad was brought al bed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cked with <HI>Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and the <HI>Sachim</HI> of that place (called <HI>Aspinet</HI>) made peace with the English.</P>
<P>Now it was, that an Indian called <HI>Coubatant</HI> (who, though a petty Sachim under Massasoit, secretly conspired with the Narragansets a|gainst his Master) occasioned some disturbance, seeking to destroy those Indians that were friends to the English, especially <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bbomock</HI> &amp; <HI>Squantum,</HI> saying if these were dead the English had lost their tongue, watching his advantage at a time when those Indians were at <HI>Nanasket Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">atant</HI> took <HI>Squa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tum</HI> prisoner, and held a knife at <HI>Hobbom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> breast, who brake from him, and gave the English at Plymouth to un|derstand what had hapned; whereupon 14. men were sent armed to <HI>Nama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ket,</HI> in order to revenging <HI>Squantum's</HI> supposed death. They surprized the house where <HI>Coubatant</HI> was thought to be, declaring the end of their coming, &amp; that they would hurt no man but him char|ging all others not to stir at their peril til they had searched for their e|nemy; Consternation and trembling seyzed on the Indians: yet some of them violently brake away, whence they were wounded (and after|wards
<PB N="10" REF="000238_0015_0FA36E05095A8FD0">
healed) by the English. <HI>Coubatant</HI> was not there, but fled to another place, but within a while <HI>Squaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> was brought forth alive and set at liberty. After this diverse other <HI>Sachim</HI> sent gratulations to the English; yea those of the Isles of <HI>Capa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ack</HI> entreated their friendship. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> used the mediation of Massasoit to make his peace.</P>
<P>Things being brought to this peaceable state, so did they continue for a little space, the <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>Plymo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th</HI> being preserved by a miracle of providence, like a flock of sheep amidst a thousand wolve; much what as <HI>Luther</HI> saith the <HI>Church</HI> should be pictured. Their next neigh|bours amongst the Heathen did as hath been expressed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of enemyes be|come their friends, not shewing any acts of Hostility.</P>
<P>Only in the latter end of the next year, <HI>Canonicus</HI> the <HI>Narragans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> Sachim, sent an Indian to them, who enquired for <HI>Squantum,</HI> at that time gone somewhither else, whereupon the Indian left a bundle of Ar|rows, wrapped in a rattle snakes skin, and departed. When <HI>Sq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">antum</HI> was returned, He informed the Governour, that the rattle <HI>snakes</HI> skin signified <HI>Enmity,</HI> and that the designe of this bruitish salutation was to intimate a challenge, wherefore the Governour filled the snakes skin with powder and shot, and sent it back again, withal giving <HI>Canoni|cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to understand, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had shipping at hand, he would endeavour to beat him out of his Countrey. The Indians durst not let the powder &amp; shot continue in their houses, but every one was afraid to meddle with it, at last it came back again to plymouth. And there was an end of that matter. Only they at Plymouth were by this <HI>Bruit</HI> awakened to Impale their Town, and fortify, lest there should be an Onset from the enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Hobbomo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k</HI> (who resided with the English) infor|med that there was reason to suspect that the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Indians were Consederate with the <HI>Narragans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> in their bloody designes; And <HI>Squantum</HI> in wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">btilty, laboured to make the English beleive that <HI>Massasoit</HI> was false to them. Capt. <HI>Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ish</HI> with ten men was sent to <HI>Massachu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ts:</HI> they had no sooner turned the point of the Harbour but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> came an Indian running to some of the English that were from home, having his face wounded, and the blood fresh on the same (<HI>Zopirus</HI>-like) calling to them to repair home, and oft looking behind him, as if he had been pursued by enemyes, saying, that at <HI>Namesket</HI> there were many of the <HI>Narragan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> and <HI>Coubatant,</HI> and that <HI>Massasoit</HI> was Confederate with them, purposing to assault the town in the Captains absence, professing that he had recei|ved that wound in his face, because he had spoken on the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eir
<PB N="11" REF="000238_0016_0FA36E05C98F5B70">
be halfe. Whenas all this was a piece of artificial and mischievous dissi|mulation, whereby the English were put into a sad fright, and the great Guns were discharged to remand the Captain back again, who immediately returned. <HI>Hobbomock</HI> was confident that that Indian di|ssembled, for he was assured&punc; of <HI>Massasoits</HI> fidelity; however that he would not engage in a thing of that nature, without consulting him who was one of his <HI>Panies's</HI> i. e. Champions and Counsellours, and it was against the Indian custom for a <HI>Sachim</HI> to involve himselfe in <HI>War</HI> without them. Wherefore, <HI>Hobbomock</HI> privately, upon the Governours advice sent his <HI>Sq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> to <HI>Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">soit</HI> at <HI>Pocan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ket,</HI> who seemed to be much troubled that the English, and he himself should be so abused. And upon enquiry, it was found to be <HI>Squa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tum's</HI> knavery, who sought his own end, and plaid his own Game; for he would in a clandestine way, make the Indians beleive, that the English were resolved to cut them off, only he could prevent it, and so would obtain gifts from his countreymen to prevent their destruction by the English, insomuch that the blind salvages began to have him in greater veneration then their <HI>Sachims,</HI> taking him for their <HI>Protector.</HI> And he would deal with no lesse falsness towards the English then towards those of his own nation.</P>
<P>When <HI>Massasoit</HI> understood these things, he repaired to the English plantation, endeavouring to clear his innocency, desiring the Gover|nour that <HI>Squantum,</HI> who had thus abused both English and Indians, might be put to death for his Treason. The Governour pacified him as much as he could for the present, and though he deserved to dy both in respect or English &amp; Indians, yet desired he might be spared, because else they should want an Interpreter.</P>
<P>But not long after this, <HI>Massasoit</HI> sent diverse Indians, who brought to the Governour, their <HI>Sachim</HI> own knife (according to the Indian mode) that his enemyes head and hands might be cut&punc; off therewith&punc;</P>
<P>At that instant when he Governour was about to deliver <HI>Squantum</HI> into the head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his executioners, a boat was seen at sea, &amp; there being even in those daye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Jealousies, that the French would join with the Indi|ans to mischief the English,&amp; some supposing that it might be a French vessel, he told the Indians, he would see what that was, before he de|livered <HI>Squantum</HI> up to them. So did they go away displeased.</P>
<P>But this wrought well for the English; For it made <HI>Squantum</HI> be ho|nest whether he would or no; inasmuch as his own countreymen sought his life; he saw how it was his Interest to adhere to the English.</P>
<P>As for the boat mentioned, it proved to be one that belonged to a ship that was fishing about <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000238_0017_0FA36E0687F29778">
These things hapned in <HI>May,</HI> 1622. in which year it was that Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> (a merchant of good note in <HI>London</HI>) attempted the advancing a plantation in this <HI>Massachusets Bay.</HI> He sent over two ships, and a|bout sixty men to make a beginning. The most of them were for the present refreshed at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> whilst some few Coasters went out to seek a convenient place to sit down in. They pitched upon a place with|in <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> then called by the Indians <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> at this day known by the name of <HI>We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Winslow</HI> (who was afterwards Governour of Plymouth Colony) reports that the <HI>Westonians</HI> instead of proving an help to the other En|glish Colony, had like within a few moneths to have brought ruine not only upon themselves, but upon their friends also: For complaints were quickly brought to Plymouth, that the English at <HI>Wessegusquaset,</HI> did abuse the Indians by stealing their corn from them, yea and one of them was so bruitish as to turn Indian.</P>
<P>Others of them were of such servile and slavish dispositions, as that they became servants to the Indians, who would hire them to work with them in making Canoos, which Canoos were intended for the sur|prizal of the English ship, in the day when they would execute their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|signed Massacre.</P>
<P>Some of the Theeves were stockt and whipt, yea one of them was at last put to death, to satisfie the Indians, but it was then too late.</P>
<P>By the end of <HI>February,</HI> they had spent all their bread and corn, not leaving any for seed, nor would the Indians be induced to lend or sel them any, upon any terms, hoping they would be starved to death.</P>
<P>Wherefore, they purposed to take away the Indians store from them by violence, and therefore made preparations accordingly. Only some of the Company (at leastwise one of them who is yet alive) being more honestly minded then others were, advised <HI>John Saunders</HI> their Over|seer, to write to <HI>Plymouth</HI> before they did actually attempt anything, which being done, they received letters from the Governour there, sig|nifying great disapprobation of their intended proceedings, whereupon they desisted.</P>
<P>These motions must needs cause ill blood between the Nations: so that the Indians grew very insolent in their carriage, and there were se|cret conspiracyes to cut off the English. And inasmuch as they thought that if they should destroy the <HI>Westonians,</HI> and leave he <HI>Plymoutheons</HI> (who had not wronged them) alive, these would take an opportunity to be revenged for those; wherefore they concluded to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all before them, as was afterwards revealed by <HI>Massasoit,</HI> and by another Sachim

<P>The English of Plymouth as yet being Ignorant of the bloody mis|chief, which the Treacherous hearts of the Indians had concluded a|gainst them, attended the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> occasions as formerly.</P>
<P>Upon a time Capt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> going with some men in a Shallop, to buy Corn of the Indians at <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> one of them stole certain trifles out of the Shallop; whereupon the Captain repaired to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> and told him, that if he did not immediately restore those things, he would re|venge it before his departure, and so took leave for that night.</P>
<P>The next morning, the <HI>Sachim</HI> came accompanied with his train of salvages, saluting the Captain in such a manner as was hugely ridicu|lous to the English; For he put out his tongue, that one might see the root of it, and so licked the Captains hands, al his men doing the like, and endeavouring (according to the rude information they had recei|ved from <HI>Squantum</HI>) to make him a leg, he did perform his Ceremony after such an odd manner, as the English were hard put to it to refrain from open laughter.</P>

<P>After these Complements were over, he restored the things that were lest; withal declaring, that he had <HI>much beaten</HI> the Indian that did <HI>Commonten</HI> (i.e. steal) the trifles mentioned.</P>
<P>But not long after this, the Captain was in no smal hazard of his life in another place; For going to <HI>Manomet</HI> (now called <HI>Sandwich</HI>) and being there entertained in the house of <HI>Kuna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">um,</HI> the <HI>Sachim</HI> there the Indians designed to cut off him and his men.</P>
<P>There was with him at this time, a <HI>Cap-Indian</HI> called <HI>Paomlt,</HI> who pretended friendship to the English, but was secretly joined in the bloody Confederacy. That he might not be suspected, he professed spe|cial affection towards the Captain, and would, as a gift, bestow some Corn upon him, and help him to carry the Corn to his beat, and would lodge in the <HI>Wigwam</HI> with Capt. <HI>Standish,</HI> to manifest what love and honour he did bear towards him, having in the mean time promised the Indians to kil him that night, and when he was killed the rest were to dispatch his men.</P>
<P>Also whilst he was entertained in the Sachims house, there came in two Massachuset Indians, being desperate bloody villains. The name of the Chief of them was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who took a dagger from about his neck, and presented it to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> and made a speech to him(which the Captain could not understand) boasting of his own valour,
<PB N="14" REF="000238_0019_0FA36E08083768A8">
and how he had been the death of Christians both French and English and what pittifull weak Creatures they were, that when they were kil|ling, they died crying, and made sower faces, more like children then men, and that whereas they were determined to kil the English (who had injured them) of Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> plantation, the best way for their own security was, to kill them of <HI>Plymouth</HI> too, now their Captain being in their hands, having but six men with him, two or three in the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and no more in the shallop, it was a good opportunity to begin.</P>
<P>The murderous Counsel of this Audacious Bloud-sucker, was highly applauded; and the Indians waited when Capt. <HI>Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ish</HI> would fall a|sleep, that they might attempt the bloudy Tragedy. But God so or|dered that he could not sleep that night. Also, an Indian secretly stole some Beads from him; which when the Captain perceived, he immedi|ately called his six men together, and they beset the Sachims house, pro|fessing to him that as they would not doe wrong to him, so neither would they receive any, and therefore as they valued their lives, they should forth with restore the stolen goods. Hereupon the <HI>Sach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> be|stirred himself to find out the Thief, and having done so, he cometh to the Captain desiring him to look into his boat, if the beads that he missed were not there, who looking found them lying openly on the Cuddy, the Indians having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lily conveyed them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hither. However this did so daunt the courage of the treacherous and cowardly Indians, that they attempted not their designed mischief.</P>
<P>All this while, they of Plimouth Colony had no certain knowledg of the evil that was intended against them, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Heathen albeit the Con|spiracy was very strong, for the Indians at <HI>Nosset, Paomet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Manomet, Mattachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t, Agara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> were all in this Confederacy to cut off the English. But God who hath a special eye of providence over his people: did at that time so order, that <HI>Massasoit</HI> fell sick, whereup|on the Governour that then was, desired Mr. <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and another Gentleman to give the sick Sachem a visit, and administer some Physick to him.

So that it would have made the hardest heart to have relented to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him.

<P><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bbomock</HI> told him that the Governour of Plymouth had sent some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nds to visit him in his sickness, and that they had brought some <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">askiet</HI> i.e. <HI>Physick,</HI> for him.

<P>As they were ready to return home, he privately told <HI>Hobbomock</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plot among the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and other Indians, to destroy the English, and how they had sollicited him to join with them, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that neither he, nor any of his men were in their Combination. He advised, that the Governour of plymouth would without delay, send <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd take off the <HI>Principal Actors</HI> in this wicked designe, and then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">est would be afraid. And whereas the Governour had sometimes said they would not begin with the Indians, until the Indians began with them, he earnestly counselled him not to stay for that, left it should be too late.</P>
<P>The first day whilst their journey back again, they were accom|panyed with <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">batant</HI> the Sachim of <HI>Metapoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et</HI> (before mentioned) who was a politick and jocofe Indian, and stil suspected to be false to the English; He asked Mr. <HI>Winslow,</HI> how they, being but two, dared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o trust themselves amongst so many Indians. Answer was made that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ove was without fear, and they wished wel to the Indians, and there|fore did not fear evil from them. But then, said the Indian, what is the reason, that when we come to <HI>Patuxet,</HI> you hold the mouthes of your guns against us; he was told, that was the English manner of en|tertaining their friends. At which the Sachim shaked his head, withal declaring, that he did not like such salutations. The next day, <HI>Hobbo|nock</HI> acquainted the English, with what <HI>Massasoit</HI> had revealed to him.</P>
<P>So then being returned to plymouth, It was on March 23. resolved, to hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en to <HI>Massaloits</HI> advice; many other things at that juncture ap|pearing, which confirmed the truth of what was by him discovered.
<PB N="16" REF="000238_0021_0FA36E0989B95970">
And considering, that there was no dealiug with Indians (as other na|tions do one with another) above board, it was thought most expedient by policy, to catch them at unawares, as they are wont to do by others Wherefore Capt. <HI>Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">h</HI> made choice of eight men, to go with him to <HI>Wesegusquaset,</HI> pretending to trade with them, and then to take his opportunity to seyze upon the <HI>Ringleader&punc;</HI> amongst the Conspirators.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, Two principal Conspira|tors behaved themselves very insolently. One of them called <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cksu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> who was a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> or Counsellour, Jeered at Capt. <HI>Standish,</HI> because he was a man of little stature, and yet a Captain. Another called <HI>Wit|tawamat</HI> (before mentioned) cast out bloody expressions, shewing a sharp knife, which had a womans face pictured on the handle, saying, that he had killed French men, and English too, with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nife, and that he had another knife, which had a mans face pictured on it, and his two knives should marry shortly, <HI>and that by and by it should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at, though not speak.</HI> Likewise another Indian, and <HI>Wittawamat,</HI> brother, who in bloodiness was like unto him, being present; Capt. <HI>Standish</HI> snatched <HI>Pick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> knife from about his neck, and killed him with his own knife. At the same time his men fell upon <HI>Wittawa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at,</HI> and the o|ther Indian, and slew them, and took <HI>Wittawamats</HI> brother, and han|ged him.</P>
<P>After this they set upon another company of Indians, and killed two or three of them, seeing stil after more. At length they espied a file of Indians making towards them, but as the English came to the en|counter, they (i.e. the Indians) ran behind the trees, and shot at Capt. <HI>Standish,</HI> until one as he was shooting, had his arm broke by a bullet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one of Capt. <HI>Standish</HI> his souldiers, whereupon he, and the rest fled into a <HI>Swamp.</HI> The Captain dared the <HI>Sachim</HI> to come out, and fight like a man, but in vain.</P>
<P>At the time of these skirmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hes, there was an Indian youth, who not|withstanding the slaughter made amongst his countreymen, came run|ning to the English, desiring that he might be with them. He confessed that the Indians had resolved to cut off Mr.<HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> men and that they only stayed for the finishing of two Canoos more (which if Capt <HI>Stand|ish</HI> had not so unexpectedly come upon them had been finished) that were intended for the surprizal of the English ship in the harbour.</P>
<P>Also an Indian S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ye, who was taken prisoner and detained at <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> when he saw Cap. <HI>Standish</HI> return with <HI>Wittawamats</HI> Head, look|ed on it with a guilty, gastred countenance, and then confessed the Plot that was in hand to destroy the English, and that <HI>Pick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="000238_0022_0FA36E0A496D2988">
<HI>Wittawamat,</HI> together with three <HI>Powaws,</HI> were the principal Conspi|rators. He was released, and sent to <HI>Oktakiest,</HI> the Sachim of the <HI>Mas|sachusets,</HI> to signify what he must look for, in case he should continue in hostility against the English. The Sachim being amazed, and terri|fied with the English successes, humbly begged for peace, pretending that he could not keep his men in order, and that it was against his will that evil had been done to, or designed against the English.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the effect of these things was, that the rest of the Indians were stricken with such terror, and dread of the English, that they left their houses, and betook themselves to live in unhealthful <HI>Swamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> whereby they became subject to miserable diseases, that proved mortal to multitudes of them. Particularly, <HI>Kunacum</HI> Sachim of <HI>Manomet, Aspinet</HI> Sachim of <HI>Nosser, janowgh</HI> Sachim of <HI>Mattachiest,</HI> these all fell sick &amp; died. This last Sachim said, that <HI>the God of the English was offended at the Indians, and would destroy them in his anger.</HI> And these signal appea|rances of God for his <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> must needs be a great con|viction to the Heathen. Howbeit these motions ended in the subversion and ruine of Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> plantation; God who determines the bounds of mens habitations, having appointed, that another people out of <HI>England</HI> should come afterward, and possess that place, as at this day.</P>
<P>And thus far is Mr. <HI>Winslo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> Relation of these <HI>first Troubles</HI> by In|dians in these parts, which I take to be undoubted verity: For he was one that had particular knowledge of those things, and a man of truth, and conscience, that would not for the world willingly falsify in any particular.</P>
<P>There is an old <HI>Planter</HI> yet living in this countrey, being one of those that were employed by Mr. <HI>Weston,</HI> who also hath given some account of these matters.</P>
<P>He doth relate, and affirm, that at his first coming into this coun|trey, the English were in a very distressed condition, by reason of fa|mine, and sickness which was amongst them, whereof many were alrea|dy dead; and that they buried them in the night, that the Indians might not perceive how low they were brought.</P>
<P>This <HI>Relator</HI> doth moreover declare, that an Indian <HI>Panies,</HI> who se|cretly purposed bloody destruction against the English, and made it his design to learn the English tongue, to the end he might more readily accomplish his hellish devices, told him, that there had been a French vessel cast away upon these coasts, only they saved their lives and their goods, and that the Indians took their goods from them, and made the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> their servants, and that they wept very much, when
<PB N="18" REF="000238_0023_0FA36E0B13A9E3C8">
Indians parted them from one another, that they made them eat such meat as they gave their dogs. Only one of them having a good Ma|ster, he provided a Wife for him, by whom he had a Son, and lived longer then the rest of the French men did; and that one of them was wont to read much in a Book (some say it was the New-Testament) and that the Indians enquiring of him what his Book said, he told them it did intimate, that there was a people like French men that would come into the Country, and drive out the Indians, and that they were now afraid that the English were the people of whole coming the French man had foretold them. And that another ship from <HI>France</HI> came into the <HI>Massachusets Bay</HI> with Goods to Truck, and that Indian <HI>Panies</HI> propounded to the Sachim, that if he would hearken to him, they would obtain all the French mens Goods for nothing, namely, by coming a multitude of them aboard the vessel, with great store of Bea|ver, making as if they would Truck, &amp; that they should come without Bows and arrows, only should have knives hid in the flappets which the Indians wear about their loins, and when he should give the <HI>Watch|word,</HI> they&punc; should run their knives into the French mens bellyes, which was accordingly executed by the Indians, and all the French men kil|led, only Mounsier <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inch</HI> the Master of the vessel being wounded, ran down into the Hold, whereupon they promised him that if he would come up, they would not kill him, notwithstanding which, they brake their word, and murdered him also, and at last set the ship on Fire.</P>
<P>Some enquiring of him how long it was since the Indians first saw a ship, he replyed that he could not tel, but some old Indians reported, that the first ship seemed to them to be a Floating Island, wrapped to|gether with the roots of trees, and broken off from the Land, which with their <HI>Canoos</HI> they went to see, but when they found men there and heard gunns, they hasted to the shore again not a little amazed. (Some write that they shot arrows at the first ship they saw thinking to kill it)</P>
<P>This <HI>Relator</HI> doth also affirm, that after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sies began between the English of Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> plantation and the Indians, they built diverse of their <HI>Wigwams</HI> at the end of a great Swamp, near to the English, that they might the more suddenly and effectually doe what was secret|ly contrived in their hearts: and an Indian Squaw said to them that ere long <HI>Aberkiest</HI> would bring many Indians that would kill all the English there and at <HI>Ratuxet.</HI> After which the <HI>Sachim</HI> with a compa|ny of his men came armed towards them, and bringing them within the Pale of the English Plantation, he made a speech to the English with
<PB N="19" REF="000238_0024_0FA36E0C2EF9D548">
great gravity saying, <Q>When you first came into this land, I was your friend, we gave gifts to-one another. I set you have land as much as we agreed for, and now I would know of you if I or my men have done you any wrong.</Q> Unto whom the English replyed, that they desired, that he would first declare whether they had injured him.</P>
<P>The Sachim roundly&punc; rejoyned, that either some or all of them had been abusive to him; for they had stolen away his corn, and though he had given them notice of it times without number, yet there was no satisfaction nor reformation attained.</P>
<P>Hereupon, the English took the principal <HI>Thief</HI> and bound him and delivered him to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> with all declaring, that he might do with him what he pleased. Nay (said he) Sachim&punc; do justice themselves upon their own men, and let their neighbours do justice upon theirs, otherwise we conclude that they are all agreed, and then fight.</P>
<P>Now the Indians some of them began to tremble, and beholding the Guns which were mounted on the English Fort, they said one to ano|ther (in their Language) that little guns would shoot through houses, and great guns would break down trees, and make them fall and kill Indians round about. So did they depart at that time dissatisfied and enraged.</P>
<P>The English now perceiving that the Indians were fully purposed to be revenged on them, they resolved to fight it out to the last man.</P>
<P>As they were marching out of the Fort, seven or eight men stood stil&punc; saying, this is the second time that the Salvages had demanded the life of him that had wronged them, and therefore they would have him first put to death, and if that would not satisfy, then to fight it out to the last, wherefore he was put to death in the sight of the Heathen; after which the English marched out towards them, but they dispersed themselves into the woods.</P>
<P>This <HI>Relator</HI> endeavoured to give notice to them in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> how that the Indians had contrived their ruin, but he missed his way between <HI>Weymouth</HI> and <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and it was wel he did so; for by that means, he escaped the savage hands of those Indians, who immediately pursued him, with a murderous intention Ere he could reach <HI>Plymouth,</HI> they were informed by <HI>Massaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> (as hath been declared) concerning what was plotted amongst the Indians.</P>
<P>Finally there were (as this <HI>Relator</HI> testifieth) three several skirmishes with the Indians. One at <HI>Wesegusquaset,</HI> before mentioned&punc; another at a place where the town of <HI>Dorchester</HI> is since planted; and lastly at the Bay of <HI>Agawam</HI> or <HI>Ipswich;</HI> in all which engagements, the Indians
<PB N="20" REF="000238_0025_0FA36E0C87D5CC60">
were notably beaten, and the English received no considerable damage, so that the Sachims entreated for peace, nor were the English, (provi|ded it might be upon terms safe and honourable) averse thereunto, <HI>Pacem t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> poscimus omnes.</HI></P>
<P>These dark clouds being thus comfortably dispelled, and blown o|ver, the <HI>first Planters</HI> in this Country received no considerable distur|bance from the Indians a long time. It is true, that soon upon these motions, (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in August, Anno 1623.) a Gentleman arrived here out of <HI>England</HI> (namely Capt. <HI>Robert Gorges</HI>) being attended with ma|ny servants, as purposing the settlement of an English plantation in this Bay of <HI>Massachusets;</HI> and although that plantation was&punc; quickly deser|ted and dissolved, other things, and not any anoyance from the Natives here caused those designs to prove abortive.</P>
<P>The like is to be affirmed concerning Mr. <HI>Wollas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ons</HI> plantation. For whereas he with several others, being persons of quality, did (in the year 1625) with a multitude of servants come into this <HI>Massachu|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bay,</HI> as intending to settle a plantation therein, they met with such cross providences as did discourage them, and at last dissipate them, yet nothing from the Indians.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that this Gentleman considering the unhappy <HI>Catastrophe's</HI> attending Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gorges,</HI> their plantings at <HI>Wesegusquaset,</HI> conceited that the Indian <HI>Powaws</HI> had brought that place under some fascination, and that Englishmen would never thrive upon <HI>Enchanted ground,</HI> and therefore they would pitch down their stakes in a place nearer to <HI>Boston;</HI> even where the town of <HI>Brantree</HI> hath since flourished; but the difficultyes of a Wilderness were&punc; too hard for them, that Mr. <HI>Wollaston</HI> removed a great part of his servants to <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> not having (so far as I can understand) received any molestation from the Indians here.</P>
<P>In Anno 1628. Mr. <HI>Endecot</HI> (who deserves to be honourably menti|oned, as having been a <HI>Patriot</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) arrived here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a <HI>Patent</HI> for the Government of the <HI>Massachusets.</HI> He and others with him sat down at a place called <HI>Nahumkeik</HI> (as in a Parenthesis let me here observe, that that Indians word is also Hebrew, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Nahum</HI> signifieth <HI>Consolation,</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ik</HI> is hebrew for a <HI>Boosome,</HI> or haven, and it so fals out, that the English have hapned to call that place by another name which is also Hebrew, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Salem</HI>) There did they enjoy <HI>Peace.</HI> How|beit there are Antient Planters, who testifie that the Indians being pos|sessed with some fears lest the English should in time take their Coun|trey
<PB N="21" REF="000238_0026_0FA36E0D498418A0">
from them, were conspiring to destroy them. And the small handfull of Christians then in <HI>Salem,</HI> were alarmd with the report of no less then a thousand Barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lords day, whereupon they discharged several great guns, the small shot&punc; wherein made such a terrible ratling amongst the trees a|far off, that the amazed Indians returned not a little affrighted. And it was a wonderfull providence of God, now to restrain the Heathen, since it so hapned that about this time there were some Tumults a|bout the English themselves. For whereas Mr. <HI>Wollaston.</HI> and his Part|ners left some of their servants here; and gave order that a man whose name was <HI>Filcher,</HI> should command and oversee them. There was an|other whose name was <HI>Thomas Morton,</HI> he would needs take upon him to be <HI>Lord of Mis-rule,</HI> and having gained much by trading with the <HI>Indians,</HI> this <HI>Morton</HI> and his drunken Companions quickly wasted all in riotous living.</P>
<P>This was the man that taught the Indians in these parts <HI>the use of Guns,</HI> how they should charge and discharge them, and imployed them in Hunting for him: And when they were instructed in the use of these instruments of death, they would purchase them at any rates, whereby the safety of the English was not a little hazzarded.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the English at <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Salem,</HI> agreed to seyze upon this <HI>Morton,</HI> which was done <HI>Vi &amp; armis,</HI> and he was sent over to <HI>England,</HI> there to receive such punishment as by the honourable Council for <HI>New-England</HI> should be thought meet.</P>
<P>All these tumults notwithstanding, the over-ruling providence of God kept the Indians quiet.&punc;</P>
<P>It is to be wondred at, that the Church in <HI>Plymouth</HI> should be pre|served when other English Plantations could not subsist in this Coun|trey, but either the Indians, or the Lords own hand brought them to a sudden end from time to time. But God who saw that they designed something better then the world, in their planting here, brought it to pass by such wayes as these,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Massasoit</HI> (as was hinted before) was perswaded by <HI>Squantums</HI> information, that if the English should be his friends, he need not fear any enemies in the World, so did he become a wall to the English at Plymouth against other Indians. The Earth helped the woman that was fled into the Wilderness, whom the Dragon would have swallow|ed up.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord made them very successful in their expeditions against those enemies that first sought their destruction.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="000238_0027_0FA36E0E08C4FEC0">
3. They prevailed with God by Fasting and Prayer to look upon them and bless them with special mercy when it was a time of need, which did greatly affect and astonish the Indians: some of them there|fore conceiving high thoughts concerning the English mans God, and his love to his people, that truly fear and serve him. That which Mr <HI>Winslow</HI> (and since him another) doth publickly testifie concerning this matter, deserveth Commemoration, namely, that whereas after the <HI>First Indian Troubles</HI> were over, there was a sore drought on the land continuing for the space of six Weeks, insomuch that it was judged by some that the corn was withered and dead, past recovery, the <HI>Church in Plymouth</HI> set themselves by Fasting and Prayer, to seek mer|cy from the Lord in this thing. And although in the morning when they assembled themselves, the heavens were clear, and the drought as likely to continue as ever, yet before their solemn Exercise was ended, the heavens grew black with clouds, and the next morning these clouds distilled rain, and for the space of fourteen dayes together there were moderate showers, so that the drooping corn was revived to admi|ration.</P>
<P>A friendly Indian, before mentioned, known by the name of <HI>Hobbo|mock,</HI> living in the town of Plymouth, enquired why the English met together in that manner, it being but three dayes after the Sabba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; and being informed of the true cause thereof, and observing the graci|ous effects that followed, he was greatly affected, and told other Indi|ans of it, who were also smitten with deep conviction, and the more in that, albeit in times of Drought the Indians are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to <HI>Powaw</HI> and cry to their gods, sometimes for many dayes together, yet if rain follow, it is wont to be accompanied with terrible Thundring and Lightning and tempests, which often do more hurt then the rain doth good: whenas it was otherwise with respect to the showers which at this time came from Heaven, in answer to the Prayers of the Church in Plymouth, So that the Heathen confessed that the English mans God was better then theirs. And some amongst the Indians became faithfull to the English, though as yet but a very few,</P>

<P>There having been (as was said) a <HI>Patent</HI> for the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Go|vernment by royal Grant obtained, many out of England flocked into this Country almost every year. And for the most part, not so much on the account of Trade, or to prosecute any worldly interest, as on the account of Religion. These did God own, having wonderfully made way for their planting here by casting out the Heathen before them,

with mortal Diseases, especially by the <HI>Plague</HI> amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony, and the <HI>Small Pox</HI> among the <HI>Massachusets.</HI></P>
<P>In Anno, 1631. New jealousies arose concerning the treacherous Indians. Capt. <HI>Walker</HI> one evening had two arrows&punc; shot through his that, which caused an Alarm at <HI>Lyn,</HI> then known by the name of <HI>Saw|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">:</HI> but no lives were lost, nor is there any certainty to this day who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> those arrows, whereby the Captains life was so eminently endan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed.</P>
<P>About the same time the Indians began to be quarrelsome touching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bounds of the Land which they had sold to the English; but God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the controversy by sending the small pox amongst the Indians at <HI>August,</HI> who were before that time exceeding numerous; whole towns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them were swept away, in some of them not so much as one Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the destruction.

<P>Not long after this, when the town of <HI>Ipswich</HI> was first planted, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vehemently suspected that the Tarratines (or eastern Indians) had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ign to cut off the English there.

<HEAD>Some Grounds of the War against the Pequots.</HEAD>
<P>In or about the year 1633. One Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> arrived in the <HI>Massa|chusets,</HI> in a ship from <HI>Virginia,</HI> who sometime after was bound for <HI>Virginia</HI> again, in a smal Bark, with one Capt.<HI>Norton,</HI> who sailing up Connecticut River, about two leagues from the entrance, cast An|chor; there coming to them several Indians belonging to that place, whom the <HI>Pequotts</HI> tyranized over, being a potent and a warlike peo|ple they being accustomed so to deal with their neighbouring Indians. Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> having some occasion with the Dutch, who lived at a Tra|ding house, near twenty leagues up the River, procured some of those Indians to go as Pilots with two of his men to the Dutch; but they be|ing
<PB N="25" REF="000238_0030_0FA36E104851DE18">
benighted, before they could come to their desired port, put the Skiffe, in which they went, ashore; where the two Englishmen falling asleep, were both murdered by their Indian guides, there remaining with the Bark, about twelve of the aforesaid Indians, who had in all probability, formerly plotted their bloody designe, and waiting an opportunity when some of the English were on shore, and Capt.<HI>Stone</HI> asleep in his Cabin, set upon them and cruelly murthered every one of them, and plundered what they pleased, and afterward sunk the Bark.</P>
<P>These Indians were not native <HI>Pequots,</HI> but had frequent recourse to them, to whom they tendered some of those goods, which were ac|cepted by the chief Sachem of the <HI>Pequots:</HI> and some of the Goods were tendered to the Sachim of <HI>Niantick</HI> who also received them.</P>
<P>The Honoured Council of the <HI>Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">chusets</HI> hearing of these pro|ceedings of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> sent to speak with them&punc; &amp; had some Treatyes, but no issue was made to satisfaction.</P>
<P>After which, Capt.<HI>John Endicot</HI> was sent forth Commander in chief, with Capt.<HI>Underhill,</HI> Capt.<HI>Turner</HI> and about an hundred and twen|ty men, who were firstly designed against a people living on <HI>Block|Island,</HI> who were subject to the <HI>Narraganset Sachem,</HI> they having taken a Barke of Mr. <HI>John Oldam,</HI> murthering him and his Compa|ny. They were also to call the <HI>Pequots</HI> to an account about the mur|thering of Capt. <HI>Stone:</HI> who arriving at <HI>Pequod,</HI> had some Conference with them, but little was effected, only one <HI>Indian</HI> slain, and some <HI>Wigwams</HI> burnt.</P>
<P>After which the <HI>Pequots</HI> grew enraged against the English who in|habited&punc; <HI>Connecticut,</HI> being but a small number, about two hundred &amp; fifty who were there newly arrived, as also about twenty men at <HI>Sey|B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook</HI> under the command of Leiut. <HI>Lion.

<P>The <HI>Pequots</HI> observing Lieut. Gardner going to fire the Meadows about half a mile off the Fort, with ten men with him, was violently assaulted by the <HI>Pequod Indians,</HI> so that some were slain, the rest were rescued by the Souldiers issuing out of the Fort upon the said <HI>Pequots</HI> who fled. They also seized some that were passing up <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, and tortured them in most cruel manner, with most barbarous and inhumane crueltyes; roasting of them alive &amp;c.</P>
<P>They also lay sculking about the Fort almost constantly, that the English could not go out of the Fort, but they were assaulted by the <HI>Pequods,</HI> so that <HI>Connecticut</HI> out of their small numbers, constrained

themselves to send Capt. <HI>John Mason</HI> with twenty men to secure the place. But after his coming, there did not one <HI>Pequod</HI> appear in view for a moneths <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pace about the Fort, which was the time he there re|mained.</P>
<P>In the interim, many of the <HI>Pequods</HI> went to a place now called <HI>We|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rsfield</HI> on <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and having confederated with the Indians of that place (as it was generally thought) they lay in ambush for the English people of that place, and diverse of them going to their la|bour in a large field adjoyning to the town, were set upon by the In|dians, nine of the English were slain upon the place, and some horses, and two young women were taken Captive.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pequo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> at their return from Wethersfield, came down to the River of Connecticut, (Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> then being at <HI>Saybr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k</HI> Fort) in three or more Canooes, with about an hundred men, the English es|pying of them, concluded they had been acting some mischief against us, and therefore prepared one of their great Gunns, and made a shot at them, which shot strook off the head of one of their Canooes wherein the two Captives were, although the shot was made at them at a great distance, near three miles: but seing&punc; it was so placed, they hastned to the shore, and drew their Canooes with what speed they could over a narrow Beach and so got away.</P>
<P>The English of <HI>Connecticut</HI> being so alarmed by these insolen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yes of the <HI>Pequods,</HI> saw meet to call a Court, which met in <HI>Hartford</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> the first day of May 1637. who seriously considering their condition, which did look very sad, since the <HI>Pequods</HI> were a great people, fortified; cruel, warlike, munitioned &amp;c. and the English but an handful in comparison of them.

<P>These things being duly considered, with the eminent hazzard and great perill the people of <HI>Connecticut</HI> were in, it pleased God so to stir up the hearts of all men in general, &amp; the Court of <HI>Connecticut</HI> in special, that they concluded it necessary that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me Forces should be sent forth speedily&punc; against the <HI>Pequots,</HI> their grounds being just, and necessity enforcing them to engage in an offensive and defensive War, the management of which Warr, with the good success the Most High was pleased to crown his people withall, we are nextly to relate.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF HISTORY Of the War with the Pequot Indians in New-England; Anno 1637.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of May, 1637. there were sent out by Connecticut Colony ninety men, under the command of Capt.<HI>John Mason</HI> (after|wards Major <HI>Mason,</HI> and Deputy Governour of Connecticut Colony,) against the <HI>Pequots,</HI> with whom went <HI>Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as</HI> an Indian Sachem of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|heag,</HI> who was newly revolted from the <HI>Pequots.</HI></P>
<P>This small <HI>Army</HI> was shipped in one Pink, one Pinnace &amp; one Shal|lop, some of which vessels in their passage down Connecticut River, fell on ground, by reason of the lowness of the water, and the unskil|fulness of the English in the channel. The Indians not being wont|ed to such things with their small Canooes, and also being impatient of all delayes, desired they might&punc; be set on shore, promising they would meet our Army at <HI>Seybrook;</HI> which request of theirs was grant|ed: and they being set at liberty hastning to their Quarters at <HI>Say|brook,</HI> met with about thirty or fourty of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> near <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ybrook,</HI> and ingaged them, and slew seven of them upon the place, and had only one of their own wounded, who was conveyed back to <HI>Connecti|cut</HI> in a Skiffe.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> hearing of the approach of the Army, went &amp; met them and informed them what was performed by <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and his men, which news was welcome to them, and looked upon as a special pro|vidence; for before they were somewhat doubtful of the fidelity of their Indian Volunteers.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> hearing of the design our Army was upon, very freely offered his Service with nineteen men to go along with them, if Leiut. <HI>Gardner</HI> would allow of it (who was chief Commander at Saybrook Fort) which motion was no sooner propounded to Lieut. <HI>Gardner,</HI> but he readily approved of it, and our Council of War ac|cepted of it also; who in liew of those twenty, immediately sent back
<PB N="28" REF="000238_0033_0FA36E128932ACE0">
twenty of theirs to Connecticut to help guard the women and chil|dren &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon a wednesday our Army arrived at Saybrook, where they say wind-bound till Friday, in which time the Council of War consulted how and in what manner they should proceed in their Enterprize, which was accompanied&punc; with much difficulty; their Commission order|ing them to land their men in the <HI>Pequit</HI> River, against which were these difficultyes.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Pequods</HI> kept a continual Guard upon the River, night 'and day in a constant course.</P>
<P>Secondly. Their numbers far exceeded ours; they had also sixteen gunns with powder and shot, besides their Indian Artilery, as our Councill of War was informed by the two captive maids (mentioned where we declared the Grounds of this War) who were redeemed by the Dutch, and restored now to us at Seybrook, which was a very friendly office, and not to be forgotten.</P>
<P>Thirdly. They were on Land, and being swift of foot, might much impede the landing of our men, and dishearten them, they continu|ally guarding that River, and our men not knowing where to land nearer then <HI>Narraganset.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. It was alledged that if our Army landed at Narra|ganset, they would come upon their Backs, and possibly might sur|prize them unawares; at worst they should be on firm Land as well as the enemy.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these reasons, the Council of Warr, all of them except the Captain, were at a stand, and could not judg it meet to fail to <HI>Narraganset.</HI> Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> in this difficult case, went to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> late Teacher to the Church of Christ at <HI>Hartford,</HI> who was sent as Preacher to the Army, and desired him that he would that night commend their case and difficultyes before the Lord, and seek direction of him in the matter, how and in what manner they should demean themselves. He retired himself from them aboard the Pink the remaining part of that day, and the follow|ing night was not wanting in spreading the case before the Lord, and seeking his direction, in the morning he came on shore to the Cap|tains chamber, and told him he had done as he desired him, (and though formerly he had been against sailing to <HI>Narraganset</HI> and land|ing there, yet now he was fully satisfied to attend it.</P>
<P>The Councel being again called, and the matter debated, &amp; rea|sons considered, they agreed all with one accord to sail to <HI>Narragan|set,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="000238_0034_0FA36E1347DE6B68">
which the next morning they put in execution, which proved very succesfull, as the sequel may evidently demonstrate. What shall I say? God led his people through manifold Difficultyes and Turnings, yet by more then an ordinary hand of Providence, <HI>He led them in a right way.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday morning, they in pursuance of their design set sail for <HI>Narraganset Bay,</HI> and on Saturday toward evening they arrived at their desired Port, where they kept the Sabbath.</P>
<P>On Munday the wind blew so hard at Norwest that they could not go on shoar, as also on Tuesday till it was near Sunset, but the wind abating, they and their design being commended to God by Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> and his Company landed, and marched up to the place of the chief Sachims residence&punc; and told him, that they had not an op|portunity before, to acquaint him with their coming armed into his countrey, yet they hoped it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accepted by him, there being amity between us and them, and also that the <HI>Pequots</HI> and they were enemies, and that he could not be unacquainted with those intolerable wrongs and injuries, those <HI>Pequots</HI> had lately done unto the English&punc; and that they were now come (God assisting) to avenge ourselves upon them, and that they did only desire free passage through his country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sachim</HI> returned this Answer, that he did accept of their com|ing, and did also approve of their designe, only he thought our numbers were too weak to deal with the enemy, who were(as he said) very great Captains, and men skilful in war, thus he spake somewhat slightingly of our men.</P>
<P>On Wednesday morning they marched from thence, to a place called <HI>Niantick,</HI> it being about eighteen, or twenty miles, distant, where another of those <HI>Narraganset</HI> Sachims lived in a Fort, it being a frontier to the <HI>Pequots.</HI> They carried it very proudly to our men&punc; not permitting any of them to come into their fort.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> beholding their carriage, and knowing the falshood of the Indians, fearing left they might discover them to the enemy, es|pecially the Indians having many times some of their neer relations a|mongst their greatest Foes, saw cause to set a guard about their fort that no Indian might oass in or out, and charged the Indians not to pass out upon the peril of their lives. And there they Quartered that night, the Indians not offering to stir out all the while.</P>
<P>In the morning came to the Army several of <HI>Miantinomie</HI> his men&punc; who told them they were come to assist them in the expedition, which encouraged diverse Indians of that place to engage also, who drawing
<PB N="30" REF="000238_0035_0FA36E1407DE7720">
into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, one by one, made solemn protestation how gallantly they would demean themselves, and how many men they would kill.</P>
<P>On Thursday, about eight of the Clock in the morning, they mar|ched thence towards <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot,</HI> having about <HI>five hundred Indians</HI> with them. In which march, through the heat of the weather, and want of provision, some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our men fainted&punc; but when they had marched a|bout twelve miles, they came to <HI>Paw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tuck</HI> River to Foord, where the Indians said the Pequots did usually fish. There they made a stand and stayed some small time; but the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians manifested great fear, and many of them returned, although they had despised our men, an said they dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> not look upon a P<HI>equot,</HI> and vaunted what great things they themselves would do.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>John Mason</HI> saw reason then to acquaint the Indians that they were come on purpose, and were resolved (God assisting) to see the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and to fight with them before they returned, although they perished; and then he enquired of <HI>Uncas</HI> what he thought the Indians would do; who said the Narrigan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ets would all leave them, but as for himself, he would never leave them, and so it proved.</P>
<P>After they had there refreshed themselves with their mean Com|mons, they marched about three miles, and came to a field which had been planted with Indian corn, where they made another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: and suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that they drew neer to the enemy, who, as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> almost impregnable, which did no way, dis|courage the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but rather animated them, insomuch that they resolved to assault both the sorts at once; but the Council of War ha|ving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the matter, understood that one of the forts; in which the bloodiest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> resided, was so remote that they could not possi|bly come up with it in season, and seeing some of the souldiers spent in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with extream heat, and want of necessaries, concluded and resolved to assault, and storm the nearest fort.</P>
<P>Then they <HI>marched</HI> on in a <HI>silent manner;</HI> The Indians that remai|ned&punc; who in the march hitherto kept the Van, (being surprised with great fear felt all into the Reer. They continued their March till about an hour in the night, &amp; then coming to a little Swamp between two hills, there they pitched their little Camp, being much wearied with hard travell; supposing (by the Relations of the <HI>Indians</HI>) they were near the Fort, which proved otherwise. The rocks were their pillows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rest was sweet and pleasant to them. The night proved comfortable being clear and Moonlight. They appointed their Guards, and placed them Sentine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s at some distance, who heard their 
<PB N="31" REF="000238_0036_0FA36E14CBE15DD8">
enemies, singing in their Fort until midnight, with great insulting and rejoycing (as they were afterwards informed by <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">qrash</HI> a <HI>Pequot</HI> Cap|tain, who was revolted from the Pequots, and was one of their Guides in this march&punc; For they seeing our pinhaces sail by them a few days be|fore concluded they were afraid of them, and durst not to come near them.</P>
<P>Towards morning Captain <HI>Mason</HI> being awakened, and seeing it very light, supposed it had been day, and so they might have lost their opportunity, having determined to make their assault before day and therefore immediately roused up his Souldiers, and briefly com|mended themselves and Designe to the guidance and Protection of the Lord, and went to the assault.</P>
<P>Their Indian Guide shewing them a path said it led directly to the Fort; they took the path, and marched on the best part of two miles, wondering that they saw not the Fort; and fearing that their Indian Guide might delude them; but coming to a place where corn was newly planted at the foot of a great hill, supposed the Fort was not far off, a champion Country being round about them. There the Captain caused his Company to make a stand; and gave order that the Indians should come unto him; at length <HI>Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> &amp; <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quash</HI> came up, of whom he demanded where the Fort was; they answered, on the top of that Hill: He also enquired where the rest of the Indians were; they answered behind exceedingly afraid; he then desired them to tel the rest of their fellowes that they should by no means fly, but stand at what distance they pleased, and see whether English men would now fight or not. Then Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> came up into the Front, &amp; after Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> had commended their case to God (their being two entrances into the Fort, they divided their men; &amp; Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> lead up to that entrance on the North-east side, who approaching with|in a rod of the entrance a dog bark'd, and an Indian cryed <HI>Wanux wa|nux.</HI> He commanded his Souldiers to close up to the Fort, and fire upon them through the palizadoes, which they did, the Indians be|ing in a dead and indeed in their last sleep. The Souldiers having fired wheeled off and came to the main entrance, which was blocked up with bushes about breast high, over which Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> very couragiously leaped&punc; and stood to make good the entrance, and com|manded his Soldiers to follow him, one of which endeavouring, was entangled in the bushes, but getting back, pulled out the bushes and so the Souldiers followed their Captain into the Fort with their Swords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for they had concluded to destroy them with the

sword, and so to save the plunder.</P>
<P>The Indians as yet kept their <HI>Wigwams;</HI> Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> entred a Wigwam, and his Guard not seeing him, passed away from him, where he was strongly assaulted by many Indians, but he bravely de|fended himself, and slew several of his opposers; at last <HI>William Heyden</HI> perceiving the place where the Captain went in, essayed to go in himself, but in his entrance stumbled upon a dead man, but soon recovering himself, he fel upon the Indians. The Indians some were slain, some fled, others crept under their beds, where they slept their last; the Captain going out of the Wigwams met with many of them and put them to the sword; In which time of fight several English were wounded. Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> perceiving his men wounded, and the ene|my not yet routed, saw cause himself to go into a wigwam, and fetch out a firebrand, and putting it in one of the mats with which the wig|wams were covered, commanded one of his souldiers to throw some powder upon it, which set the mat on fire, which the wind taking; it was quickly thoroughly kindled, which made the Indians run as men most dreadfully amazed.</P>
<P>And Indeed such a dreadfull terror did the Almighty let fall upon their spirits, that they would fly from the sword, and cast themselves into the very flames, where many of them perished.</P>
<P>The fort being fired, the Captain commanded that all should march out of the fort, and surround it; which was readily attended by all, only one <HI>Arthur Smith</HI> was so wounded that he could not move out of the place, who was happily espyed by Leiut. <HI>Tho. Bull,</HI> and by him rescued from the flames, which otherwise had consumed him.</P>
<P>The fire was kindled on the <HI>Northeast</HI> side to windward, which did swiftly over run the whole Fort, to the extream amazement of the ene|my, and great rejoycing of our soldiers; some of the enemy climbed to the tops of the pallizadoes, where they were shot down, others ga|thered to the windward side of the Fort, and lay pelting at our men with their arrows, who repaied them with their smal shot, others of the stoutest issued forth of the Fort, about fourty of them who fell by the sword.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Underhil</HI> and those with him acted their parts in this trage|dy, especially one Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dge,</HI> who was the first that entred that gate to which Capt. <HI>Underhil</HI> led up; the fire was no sooner kindled but the smoke and flames were so violent, that they were constrained to desert the Fort and keep them in.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="000238_0038_0FA36E1648456A98">
Thus were they now at their wits end, who not many houres before exalted themselves in their great pride, threatning and resolving the utter ruin and destruction of all the English, exulting and rejoicing with songs and dances; but God was above them, who laughed his enemyes and the enemyes of his people to scorn, making them as a fiery oven; thus were the stout hearted spoiled, having slept their last sleep, and none of their men could find their hands; thus did the Lord judge among the heathen, filling the place with dead bodyes.</P>
<P>And here we may take notice of Gods judgement upon this bloody Generation, in sending the very night before the assault an hundred and fifty men from their other fort to join with this fort, who were design|ing (as some of themselves have related) to go forth against the English at that very instant when this stroke came upon them, where the most of them perished with their fellows, so that the mischief they inten|ded against us came upon themselves; they were taken in their own s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate and we through the mercy of God escaped. And thus in little more then one houres space was their Impregnable <HI>fort,</HI> with themselves utterly destroyed, to the number of <HI>five or six hundred,</HI> as hath been confessed by the <HI>Pequots</HI> who escaped. There were seven taken captive, and about <HI>eight</HI> escaped; and <HI>of the English</HI> there were <HI>two slain</HI> outright, and above <HI>twenty wounded.</HI> Some of our soldiers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain|ted for want of such comforts and necessaryes as were needful in such a case. The Chyrurgion was much wanted&punc; who was left with the Barks in Narraganset Bay, with order there to remain until the night before they intended the assault.</P>
<P>And thereupon grew many difficultyes amongst the Army, their pro|vision and ammunition being neer spent, and they in the enemyes coun|trey, who did far exceed them in numbers, being much enraged, and most of our Indian friends having left them, and our pinnaces at a great distance from them, and their coming uncertain.</P>
<P>But as they were consulting what course to take, it pleased God to discover our vessels to them under a fair Gale of wind failing into the <HI>Pequot</HI> Harbour, to their great rejoicing.</P>
<P>They had no sooner discovered our vessels, but immediately came up the enemy from the other fort about three hundred of them. Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> led forth a file or two of men to skirmish with them, which stopt their Carrier, and put them to a stand, and then they prepared to march towards our vessels, but four or five of our men were so wounded that they were fain to be carried, with the Armes of about twenty more which took up so many of the souldiers, that there was not above forty

men free, but at length they hired several Indians to carry the woun|ded men, who cased them of that burthen, and carried their woun|ded men for them.</P>
<P>And when the souldiers had marched about a quarter of a mile, the enemy came to the place where the fort had stood, and when they beheld the ruines thereof, and the carcases of their friends lye some upon the earth, others scorched, and some almost consumed, with the fire, they stamped and tore the hair from their heads, and ran mouting down the hill in their full Carreer, and the loss they met withal made them wary not to come near.</P>
<P>The souldiers then meeting with a small brook at the foot of the hil being very dry, sat down and refreshed themselves, the enemy being grown by this time so wary they durst not come too neer, to di|sturb them.</P>
<P>Then they marched on towards <HI>Pequot</HI> Harbour, and meeting with&punc;several <HI>Wigwams</HI> in the way they burnt them; the enemy followed them, and some lay in ambush behind rocks and trees, often shooting at them, yet God so covered them, that not one of them was hurt, and when they came to any swamp or thicket, they made some shot, and cleared a passage, and some of the enemy fell, which our Indians see|ing, would give a great shout, and then venture to fetch their heads, and thus they continued, till they came within two miles of Pequot Harbour, where the enemy gathered themselves together, and left our army, they marched on to the top of an hill adjoining to the har|bour, with their colours flying, (as for their Drum, it was lost, or at least left by their Drummer at the place where they kept their ran|dezvouze the night before) where they saw our vessels riding at An|chor to their great rejoicing, and when they had marched to the wa|ter side, there they sat down in quiet.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> being there arrived (with our vessels) with forty men sent by the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony upon some service against the block-Islanders or Pequots, came to the shore in a shallop, with some of his men, as he said, to rescue our Army, supposing they had been pur|sued, although there did appear no sign of any such thing.</P>
<P>But Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> could not be prevailed with by any means to ven|ture himself on shore while our wounded men were carried on board, which was troublesome, not only to our souldiers, but to his own men also, who manifested their dislike of his carriage; at length our men were fetched aboard our vessels, to the great rejoicing of their friends, where they did with one heart blesse the Lord, for his mercy &amp; good|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ess unto them.</P>

I might here relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> contest that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> between Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> and Capt. <HI>Patrick,</HI> about Capt. <HI>Underhil's</HI> claiming an Interest in the Bark in which Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> sailed, which by the mediation of Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> was issued, and that being the place of Randezvouze, where vessels were expected from the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> it was agreed that Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> should there ride in that Bark, and secure the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indi|ans untill our vessel could carry our wounded men to <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and our Pink return to carry home the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians.</P>
<P>After this agreement, Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> set sail for <HI>Sey brook</HI> in our Bark, but before he was out of sight, Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> signified by writing to Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> that he could not attend that Service he had ingaged for he must with his company wait at <HI>Seybrook,</HI> for some vessels he ex|pected from the Bay; advising Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> seeing he had obtained the honour of that Service, he would compleat it in securing the <HI>Nar|raganset Indians, &amp;c.</HI> Which indeed was a hard task and difficult; for the Pink could not entertain them, and to march by land was dan|gerous, it being near twenty miles, and in the enemies country, and their numbers being small; for they had sent home about twenty men to help strengthen the Plantations on <HI>Connecticut,</HI> for fear of the <HI>Pe|quods</HI> invading of them, but at last, seeing they were necessitated to march to <HI>Seybrook</HI> by land, they went ashoar with the Indians, and be|gan their march; Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> seeing what they were about, came a|shoar also with his men; and although Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> told him he did not delight in his company, yet he would and did march along with them.</P>
<P>In their march, about the mid-way between that and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ybrook,</HI> they fell upon a people called <HI>Nianticks,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Pequots,</HI> who fled to a swamp for refuge; but when they heard or saw this small troop they fled, who pursued them awhile by their track as long as they kept together; but the day being much spent, Sabbath drawing on, &amp; themselves much spent with their former travel, and service, they left their pursuit, and marched on towards <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and about sun-set they arrived by <HI>Connecticut</HI> River side; where they were welcomed by Lieut. <HI>Gardner,</HI> with many great Gunns, but were forced there to take up their Quarters that night. On the morrow morning they were all fetched over, where they kept the Sabbath, and were nobly entertai|ned by Lievt. Gardner, from whom they received many Courtesies.</P>
<P>And when they had taken order for the safe conduct of the <HI>Narra|ganset</HI> Indians to their Country, Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> with his men returned to <HI>Connecticut</HI> the place of their abode, where they were entertained with
<PB N="36" REF="000238_0041_0FA36E188AFEFCB8">
great triumph, and rejoycing and praising of God, for his goodness to us in succeeding our endeavours, in crowning them with success, and in restoring our small Army with so little loss.</P>
<P>Thus was God seen in the mount, crushing his proud enemies, and the enemies of his people, so that they who were ere while a terror to all that were round about them, who resolved to destroy all the En|glish, and to root their very name out of this Country, were by weak meanes thus vanquished and destroyed, and the mischief they plotted, and the violence they offered, was brought upon their own heads in a moment; for the Lord burnt them up in the fire of his wrath, &amp; dung|ed the ground with their flesh, it was the Lords doing, and it is marve|lous in our eyes. It is He that hath made His work wonderfull, and therefore ought to be remembred.</P>
<P>Suddenly after this, the whole Body of the remaining <HI>Pequots</HI> re|paired to that Fort where <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ous</HI> the chief Sachim did reside, and charged him that he was the only cause of all their troubles that be|fell them, and therefore they would destroy both him and his; yet by the entreaty of his Counsellors, they spared his life; and consulting what course to take, concluded there was no abiding any longer in their Country, and so resolved to fly into several parts. The greatest body of them went towards, <HI>Manadus,</HI> and in their passage over <HI>Con|necticut</HI> River, they met with three English men in a shallop going for <HI>Seybrook,</HI> and sought them, who resisted them stoutly, and killed &amp; wounded many of them, but their shallop falling on ground, they were all three slain.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after our souldiers were returned home from <HI>Mi|stick</HI> Fight, we heard of the arrival of several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> he <HI>Massa|chusets Colony</HI> in Pequot River; Capt.<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being Comman|der in chief, and with him about 120 men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were sent by that Co|lony to prosecute the War against the <HI>peq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ots;</HI> and although the main Body of the <HI>Pequots</HI> were fled, yet some straglers remained in that Country, some of whom were discovered by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and by them discovered to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Forces, by whom they were both sur|prised and taken, and several of which, to the number of about twenty three, were put to death; the rest were sent to the Bay.</P>
<P>The Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> hereupon sent forth Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> again with forty men, as also several Gentlemen, (as the Honour'd <HI>John Haines</HI> &amp; <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ger Lud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow</HI> <ABBR>Esqrs.</ABBR>) to meet with those of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> to consult and determine what was further necessary to be attended&punc; who meeting with those of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in the Pequot harbour,
<PB N="37" REF="000238_0042_0FA36E194931ED78">
after consultation, concluded to pursue the <HI>Pequots</HI> (who as you heard before were fled towards the <HI>Menados</HI>) and so began their march after them, and discovered several places where they had rendevowed and lodged not far distant one from the other, for they could make but little hast, by reason of their ancient people and children, and their want of provision, being forced to gather clams, and such other things as the wilderness afforded for their relief. The vessels sailed along by the shore. In the march, some were gleaned, but within the space of three dayes, or thereabouts, they arrived at a place then called <HI>Quinipiag</HI> (now <HI>New-haven</HI>) and there espying a great smoke in the woods, not far distant, supposing the <HI>Pequots</HI> might be there, they went to discover them; but they quickly discovered them to be Con|necticut Indians. From thence they sent a <HI>Pequot</HI> captive (whom they named <HI>Luz</HI>) upon discovery, who brought them tidings of the enemy which proved real. The <HI>Pequots</HI> were so terrified in their flight, that a <HI>Moheag</HI> Indian (named <HI>Jack Eaton</HI>) meeting in this pursuit with three <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">equots,</HI> took two of them and brought them to the English.</P>
<P>But to return, they having tidings where the <HI>Pequots</HI> were, hastned toward the place where they heard they were, and at last coming into a corn field, several of the English espyed some Indians, who fled from them. They pursued them&punc; and coming to the top of an hill, saw se|veral wigwams just opposite, only a swamp intervening, which was almost divided in two parts. One Serjeant <HI>Palmor</HI> hastning with a|bout twelve men (who were then under his command) to surround the smaller part of the swamp that so he might prevent the Indians fly|ing. But Lievt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Serjeant <HI>Jefferyes &amp;c.</HI> going up to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> were there assaulted by the Indians.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> being called, the question was propounded how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proceed? Capt.<HI>Patrick</HI> advised that they should cut down the swamp, (they having taken many Indian hatchets) Others propounded to hedge in the swamp, which others judged would be to no purpose, and therefore strongly opposed it, Some other advised to force the swamp, having time enough (it being about three a clock in the afternoon) but that being opposed, it was then propounded that the men should be drawn up close to the swamp, which would have le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ned the circumference, and then to fill up the open passages with bushes, that so they might secure them till the morning, and then con|sider farther about it.

were their apprehensions, which was very grievous to some, who con|cluded the Indians would make an escape in the night, as easily they might, &amp; did, the swamp being large and their numbers so small that they were forced to stand at a great distance one from another, which made their escape more easie.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> took order that the narrow passage in the swamp should be cut through, which would much shorten the leaguer, which was accordingly attended and resolutely performed by Serjeant <HI>Davis</HI> and some others with him.</P>
<P>Mr.<HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> a man well acquainted with the Indians lan|guage and manners, perceiving the Counsell of War loth to destroy Women and children, (as also the Indians of that place) freely offer|ed his service to go into the swamp and treat with them, which the Councel were somewhat backward to, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eason of some hazard he might be exposed to, but his importunity prevailed, who going to them did in a short time come to the Councel with near 200. old men, women and Children, who delivered themselves to the mercy of the English, most of which brought their small present with them, and laid it down before the Councell. Now night drawing on, they did beleaguer the swamp as strongly as they could.</P>
<P>But above hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e an hour before day the Indians that were in the swamp, attempted to &punc;break through Capt. <HI>Patricks</HI> Quarters, But were beaten back several times; they made a great noise, as their man|ner is at such times, which sounded round about the leaguer; Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> sent Serjeant <HI>Stares</HI> to assist those against whom the Pequots pressed to come out by, at which time also Capt. <HI>Track</HI> came in to their assistance, but the tumult encreasing, the siege was raised, and they marching up to a place at a turning of the swamp, the Indi|ans were forcing out upon them, but they fired upon them, and sent them back by their small shot; Then they waited a little for their se|cond attempt, but the Indians facing about, and pressing violently u|pon Capt.<HI>Patricks</HI> Quarters, brake through, and so escaped about seventy of them, as the Indians informed; the swamp was searched; there were but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew found slain. The Captives that were taken were a|bout an hundred and eighty, which were divided between the two Colonyes, and they intended to keep them as servants, but they could not endure that yoke, for few of them continued any considera|ble time with their masters.</P>
<P>'Thus did the Lord scatter his enemyes with his strong arm.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pequots</HI> now became a prey to all Indians; happy were they

that could bring in their heads to the English, of which there came al|most dayly to <HI>Windsor,</HI> or <HI>Hartford;</HI> But the <HI>Pequots</HI> growing weary hereof, sent some of the chief that survived to mediate with the En|glish, offering that if they might but enjoy their lives, they would be|come the English vassals, to dispose of them as they pleased.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Uncas</HI> and <HI>Miantonimo</HI> were sent for, who with the <HI>Pequots</HI> met at <HI>Hartford&punc;</HI> The <HI>Pequot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> being demanded, how many of them were then living, They answered, about an hundred and eighty or two hundred; Then were there granted to <HI>Uncas</HI> Sachim of <HI>Moheag</HI> eighty, and to <HI>Miantonimo</HI> Sachim of <HI>Narraganset</HI> eighty, and to <HI>Ninnicraft</HI> twenty men, when he should satisfy for a mare of <HI>Eltwood Pomeryes,</HI> killed by some of his men; The <HI>Pequots</HI> likewise were by covenant bound, that they should no more inhabit their na|tive countrey; nor should any of them be called <HI>Pequots</HI> but <HI>Moheags</HI> and <HI>Narragansets</HI> for ever; Shortly after about forty of them went to <HI>Moheag,</HI> others went to Long-Island, others setled at <HI>Pawcatuck,</HI> a place in the <HI>Pequot</HI> country, contrary to their covenant and agreement with the English so lately made, which <HI>Connecticut</HI> taking into consi|deration, and well weighing the inconveniences that might ensue; for the prevention whereof, they sent forth forty men under the command of Capt. <HI>Mason,</HI> to supplant them&punc; by burning their wigwams, and bringing away their corn, except they would desert the place: <HI>Uncas</HI> with about one hundred of his men in twenty cannoes also went to assist them in the service; as they sailed into <HI>Pawcatuck</HI> Bay, they met with three of those Indians whom they sent to inform the rest with the end of their coming, and also to tell them that they desired to speak with them or some of them, they promised to doe the message, and speedily to return; but they forgot to keep their word, for they came not.</P>
<P>Then they went up into the River in their vessel, but by reason of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ats were forced to land on the Westside of the River, their <HI>Wigwams</HI> be|ing on the East-side, just opposite&punc; where they saw the Indians running up and down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eering at them.</P>
<P>Then they landed, and went up into a narrow place in the River be|tween two rocks, where they drew up the Indian Cannooes, and got suddenly over the River, sooner then they were expected, and march|ed up to the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> where the Indians were all fled, except some old people that could not</P>

They then endeavoured to get be|tween the Indians and the woods, that so they might prevent their flying, which the Indians perceived, and endeavoured speedily to get away under the beach, but our men made no shot at them, but they laid hold on about seven of them, who were <HI>Ninnicrafts</HI> men, who grew very outragious; the Captain told them if they were not quiet they should be made shorter by the head; and when they were going to put it into execution, <HI>Otash</HI> Sachim of <HI>Narraganset;</HI> and brother to <HI>Miantonim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> stepped forth to Capt. <HI>Mason,</HI> and told him, those men whom he was going to execute, were his brothers men, who was a friend to the English, and if their lives might be spared, he would engage to deliver so many murtherers heads in lieu of them to the English; The Captain granted his desire, and the men were deli|vered to <HI>Uncas</HI> to be secured till <HI>Otash</HI> his engagement was per|formed.</P>
<P>Then they drew up their Bark into a Creek the better to defend her, there being some hundreds of Indians within five miles, waiting their motions.</P>
<P>But there they quartered that night. In the morning as soon as it was light, there appeared in armes at least <HI>three hundred Indians</HI> on the other side the Creek, upon which the Captain commanded his men to stand to their Armes, which the Indians percieving&punc; some of them fled, others crept behind the rocks and trees, not one of them were to be seen.</P>
<P>They then called to them, saying, they desired to speak with them, and that they would lay down their armes for that end, whereupon they stood up: The Captain told them that the <HI>Pequots</HI> had violated their promise and Covenant&punc; with the English, in that they were not there to inhabit, and that he was sent to supplant them; The Indians answered, the <HI>Pequots</HI> were good men, their friends, and they would fight for them and protect them; which words moved the Captain, who told them it was not far to the head of the creek&punc; where he would meet them, and then they might try what they could do;
<PB N="41" REF="000238_0046_0FA36E1C47D50528">
The Indians replyed, <HI>they would not fight with 'Englishmen, for they were spirits;</HI> but they would fight with <HI>Uncas.</HI> The Captain told them he thought it was too early for them to fight; but they might take their opportunity and fight when they saw cause, for they should be burning their Wigwams, and carrying their corn aboard all that day, and presently caused the Drum to be beat up, and fired their Wigwams in their view&punc; But as they&punc; marched along, there stood two Indians upon an hill jeering &amp; reviling of them; Mr. <HI>Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton</HI> the inter|preter marching at liberty, desired leave of the Captain to make a shot at them; the Captain demanded of the Indians, who they were; they answered that they were murtherers; The Captain then gave Mr, <HI>Stanton</HI> leave to make a shot at them, who did so, and shot one of them through both his thighes, which was to the wonderment both of English and Indians, it being at such a vast distance.</P>
<P>They then proceeded and loaded their Bark with Indian Corn, and their Cannoes, about thirty of them&punc; with <HI>Indian Trayes, Kettles, Mats,</HI> and other luggage, and then went on board, and made homeward, and it pleased God to prosper them, so that in a short time they all arrived in safety at the place of their abode; Though they were in hazard by the vessels striking upon a rock, and sticking thereon a while in their return, yet the Lord bore them in his own armes, and preserved them from danger.</P>
<P>Thus we may see how the face of God is set against them that do e|vil, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.</P>
<P>Our tongues therefore shall talk of his righteousness all the day long, for they are confounded, they are brought to shame that sought our hurt. <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only doth won|drous things,&amp; blessed be his holy name forever, Let the whole earth be fil|led with his glory;</HI> for the Lord was pleased to smite our enemyes in the hinder parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance, who re|membred us in our low estate, and redeemed us out of our enemies hands; Let us therefore praise the Lord for his goodness and his won|derful works to the Children of men.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it may not be amiss to gather out some specialtyes of providence, that so the goodness of God may be taken notice of, &amp; our hearts enlarged in the praise and service of that God who hath wrought so wonderfully for our fathers and for us.</P>
<P>Those who were employed in this service were not many, their Commons were very short, there being then a general scarcity through out this Colony of all sorts of provision, it being upon our very be|ginnings

on the place, they had but little refreshment with them in their long march from <HI>Narraganset to Pequot;</HI> but one pint of liquor which was moderately dealt out to such as fainted in the way, by reason of the extremity of the heat and sore travel: after the liquor was spent, the very smelling to the bottle was effectual for the revi|ving of the fainting souldiers. They walked in an unknown path, yet God guided them <HI>in the way they should got,</HI> though they knew not where the <HI>Forts</HI> were, nor how far it was to them, nor the way that lead to them otherwise then what they had from their Indian Guides, in whom they durst not confide, and that in their so long a march a|mong a treacherous people, who had several relations amongst our enemies, and that in their march, and allodgment in the enemies coun|try, which was very populous, they should not be discovered, but brought to their enemies in the fittest season, when more of them then usually were together, and that they should be so succeeded in their design, (as you have heard) is matter of wonderment.</P>
<P>What shall I say? God was pleased to hide them in the hollow of his hand. It was a Saying of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> that man of God, in his en|couragements to the Souldiers, as they were going forth to those in|gagements, that the <HI>Pequots</HI> should be bread for them; and the Lord made good his Sayings.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss here also to remember Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> (the famous Teacher of the Church of <HI>Hartford</HI>) who was sent to preach &amp; pray with those that went out in these engagements against the <HI>Pequots;</HI> He lent his best assistance and counsel in the management of those designs&punc; and the night in which the engagement was, (in the morning of it) I say that night he was with the Lord alone, wrestling with Him by Faith and Prayer; and surely his Prayers prevailed for a blessing; and in the very time when our Israel were ingaging with the bloud-thirsty <HI>Pe|quots,</HI> he was in the top of the mount, and so held up his hand, that Is|rael prevailed.</P>
<P>In those ingagements some men had special deliverances. There were two men, being one mans servants, who were both shot in the knotts of their neck-cloathes about their necks, and received no hurt. Also Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly,</HI> was shot in the eyebrow with a flat headed arrow, the point turning downward, the Captain himself pulled the arrow our.

The year following, the Colony of Connecticut being in great want of provision, Indian corn being at twelve shillings the bushel: The Court of <HI>Connecticut</HI> imployed Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> &amp;Mr.<HI>William Wads|worth,</HI> and Deacon <HI>Edward Stebbing,</HI> to make a trial what providence would afford for their relief, in this great streight; who notwithstand|ing some discouragements they met with from some English, went to a place called <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">comptuck,</HI> where they procured so much corn at rea|sonable rates, that the Indians brought down to <HI>Hartford</HI> and <HI>Windsor</HI> fifty cannoes laden with corn at one time, never was the like known to this day, so that although the Lord was pleased to shew his people hard things in their beginnings, yet did he execute judgment for the oppressed, and gave food to the Hungry, affording them his continued protection and and blessing, in the bountifull supply of the good things of this life, with the continuance of his gospel and ordinances, and a plentifull <HI>Increase</HI> of their number, from <HI>four</HI> Plantations which was then the alone number of the Colony of Connecticut; <HI>to twenty four towns,</HI> which is the present number of towns in this Colony; <HI>and from three Churches to nineteen,</HI> which is the number now setled in this Colony.</P>

<P>Thus farr is Mr. <HI>John Allyn</HI> his Narrative of the <HI>Pequot troubles,</HI> which I take to be the most perfect account thereof that is extant, or that probably will be now attained, since few of those who were per|sonally concerned in that <HI>war,</HI> and who are fit to give a <HI>Relation</HI> there|of, are at this day in the land of the living.</P>
<P>Nevertheless I have met with a Manuscript, in the Library of a learned and worthy person deceased, wherein the passages of the <HI>Pe|quot war,</HI> are described. The Author of the script&punc; I know not, nor can conjecture, saving that it was one who had a particular and per|sonal acquaintance with those affairs. It doth in substance agree with that of Mr. <HI>John Allyns:</HI> only in some particulars, a more full account of proceedings, is expressed. For, this Manuscript <HI>Anonimus</HI> doth <HI>Relate</HI> as followeth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Anno 1634. a Bark wherein was Capt. <HI>Stone,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Norton,</HI> with six men besides going up Con|necticut River, were all killed by the <HI>Pequot</HI> Indians, and the Bark sunk near a steep Rock, which to this day bears the name of Capt. <HI>Stones Rock.</HI> In the year following a Bark going from the Bay, bound to <HI>Virginia,</HI> was by a Tempest c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t away at Long-Island, certain <HI>Pequots</HI> there killed two Englishmen, the rest escaping.</P>

In Anno 1636. A Vessel going from Connecticut towards the Bay, putting in at Block Island, the Indians coming aboard to trade, killed the Master. Another vessel coming from Connecticut, taken with a cross wind, intended to put in at <HI>Narraganset,</HI> but could not; being therefore forced upon <HI>Block-Island,</HI> they saw a bark with her sayls up, driving too and fro, they hailed her, but no Answer was given; per|ceiving her full of Indians they suspected the English belonging to the Vessel were murdered, whereupon they discharged their guns, shooting bullets amongst the Indians, who, many of them immediately leaped overboard. The Master entred the Vessel, and lifting up a Cloth saw an Englishman dead, and discerning that many Indians were still in the hold, he returned to his own Vessel again, from thence pouring in small shot upon the Indians, for a while, until the wind coming fair; he failed away to <HI>Boston,</HI> informing the Governour and Council there, concern|ing what he had seen, whence about an hundred Souldiers were forth|with sent to <HI>Block-Island.</HI> As they were landing, the Indians came down and shot violently at them, wounding&punc; one man, but as soon as one Englishmen was landed, they ran away. The English pursued them two dayes, burning their Corn and Wigwams, but the Indians be|took themselves to Swamps, thereby escaping with their lives. After this they resolved for the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country, having received some Intel|ligence of the Insolency and outrage of those Indians. As they were sailing up the River, many of the <HI>Pequots</HI> on both sides of the River cal|led to them, desirous to know what was their end in coming thither, they were told that they desired to speak with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> one of their Sachems; the Indians said he was gone to <HI>Long-Island;</HI> then it was de|manded that <HI>Momanottuck</HI> another of their Sachems should appear. It was pretended that he was not at home neither. The English went a shore, and required the Indians to deliver up those that had murder|ed Capt. <HI>Stone,</HI> It was Answered, that they were also gone from home, but they would send after them, and deliver them to Justice, and that they might the better keep the English in parley, they said that their Sachem would presently come and treat with them. In the mean time they transported their goods, women and Children to another place.</P>
<P>At last one of the Indians declared plainly, that <HI>Momanottuck</HI> would not come. Immediately a Skirmish followed, wherein one Indian was killed, and an English man was wounded. The Indians fled, the Eng|lish pursuing, set fire to their Wigwams, and destroyed their Corn, so did they return to their Vessel. A few dayes after this, going on shore
<PB N="45" REF="000238_0050_0FA36E1F47E7ED00">
again, as they were loading themselves with Corn, the Indians violently assaulted them, so that they were forced to leave their Corn, and stand to their Arms, At this time an Indian was killed, and two English men sorely wounded. The Indians attempted the Vessels, but were entertained with such Volleys of smal shot, as made them afraid to board any, so the Barks arrived safe at <HI>Say-br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ok</HI> Fort. The next day some of the Fort going up the River to fetch Hay, the <HI>Pequots</HI> privily came upon them took one man and afterward roasted him alive, ano|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her shot with five Arrows lived fourteen weeks and dyed, the rest esca|ped with much danger. After this the <HI>Pequots</HI> came near the Fort &amp; destroyed many of the English Cattel. About two miles distant from the Fort there was an English house wherein were Souldiers. Their Commander charged them not to go out of doors, yet three of them would venture, and as they were a musket shot from the house, the In|dians encompassed them, and took two of them alive, the third being wounded did with his naked Sword escape through them to the house, relating to the Company the sad Event, and that one of those English that were taken did first kill two Indians. The next day all the Eng|lish deserted that house, and repaired to the Fort. The Indians then quickly burned that, and two other houses. They made towards the Fort as if they would have done some great matter; but a great Gun be|ing discharged at them, they went quite away, and were no more seen at <HI>Say-brook</HI> for the greatest part of that winter. Only three miles up the River two men going in a Canoo to shoot Geese, the Indians hear|ing the Report of their Guns, came upon them. Those two English sought to save their lives by padling, but the Indians pursued them with another Canoo shot at them and wounded one in his head, who fell overboard, the other shot stoutly at the Indians, but at last being wounded and wearied, the Indians overtook him, he with his paddle cleft one of the Indians heads, but the rest took him, and tortured him to death.</P>
<P>Feb. 22. The Lieut. with nine Souldiers well armed, went out of the Fort to burn the woods thereabouts, being gone half a mile from home they were besett with about seventy Indians, who let fly their Ar|rows very fiercely; the English retreated, one man presently was shot in the neck and then did they lay hands on him, he drew his Sword, but that was taken from him; Then would he (as the Indians afterwards testified) have killed himself with his own knife, but that also did the In|dians deprive him of, and cut off his nose and hands, and put him to a cruel death; They shot down another English man with three
<PB N="46" REF="000238_0051_0FA36E20095A8FD0">
Arrows, and a third had one of his ribs cleft with an Arrow, so that he died immediately. A fourth was mortally wounded, and though he got home alive, he died within fourteen hours, a fifth was sorely woun|ded, but afterwards recovered, and lived (the next year) to behead that very Indian who had shot an arrow into him. Yea, the Lieut. himself was wounded in this Skirmish. After this the Indians kept Leaguer be|fore <HI>Say-brook</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>March.9. A body of Indians consisting (as was conjectured) of two or three hundred came within musket shot of the Fort, challenging the English to come out and fight, mocking and upbraiding them with such words as the English used when by them tortured to death, and bragged that they could kill English men <HI>all one flyes:</HI> But two great Gunns loa|den with Carthages of musket bullets being fired at them, away they went, and hearing that the <HI>Narragansets</HI> were invading their country, they visited <HI>Seybrook</HI> no more.</P>
<P>After these things, a shallop coming down from Connecticut, with three men rowing, was set upon by several canoes of Indians, the En|glish sought stoutly so long as they could, but one of them being shot through the nose, so as the arrow went out at the crown of his head, fell overboard and dyed: The other two were taken&punc; by the Indians, who ripped them up from the bottom of the belly to the throat, and cleft them down the back throughout, and afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ung them up by the neck on a tree by the River side, that the English might see them as they passed by; the shallop they drew ashore and set on fire.</P>
<P>May. 15. 1637. Some of <HI>Uncas</HI> his men being then at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> in order to assisting the English against the <HI>Pequots,</HI> espyed seven Indians, and slily encompassing them, slew five of them, and took one Prisoner, and brought him to the English Fort, which was great satisfaction and encouragement to the English, who before that exploit had many fears touching the fidelity of the Moheag Indians. He whom they took Prisoner, was a perfideous Villain, one that could speak English well, having in times past lived in the fort, and knowing all the English there, had been at the slaughtering of all the English that were slaugh|tered thereabouts; He was a continual spy about the fort, informing <HI>Sassacus</HI> of what he saw or could learn. When this bloody traitor was executed, his limbs were by violence pulled from one another, and bur|ned to ashes; some of the Indian executioners barbarously taking his flesh, they gave it to one another, and did eat it, withall singing about the fire.</P>
<P>It is also reported that before the <HI>Mistick</HI> fight, a friendly Indian
<PB N="47" REF="000238_0052_0FA36E20CDFC2F58">
that was sent thither as a secret spy, brought word that the <HI>Pequots</HI> were singing, and dancing, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing their God, in that they sup|posed the English were gone from them; and that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight the En|glish came upon them, they were fallen into a deep sleep, by reason of their long dancing the night before, and their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntinel was gone out of his place to light a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Tobacco, just as the English surprized them, and when our souldiers gave fire there was not one that missed; the <HI>Pequots</HI> so alarumed, in horrour and amazement, crying <HI>Wannocks Wannocks,</HI> i.e. Englishmen, Englishmen; some of the old men taking hold of others that were willing to run away, and saying, as we have lived together, so let us dy together, the Wigwam which was first set on fire, being to the windward side carried all before it, (as is in the Narrative intimated) At that time there were two English men slain, (one of which was thought to be shot by an English man) and twenty four wounded, whereof one dyed within few dayes. Also fourty Indians that were friends to the English were hurt in that en|gagement. It was supposed that no less then five or six hundred Pe|quot souls were brought down to Hell that day. Moreover, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> therein added, that as the English marched towards their vessels in the River, still as they came near any swamp, they sent in a volley of shot&punc; lest the enemy should haply he in ambush in those dark places of the earth, and some Indians have related that the English did by that means kill more men of war in their marching away, then in the fight at the Fort, whereby also <HI>Sassacus</HI> his plot to cut off the English as they passed by swamp&punc;ambushments was utterly and happily frustrated.</P>
<P>It is further said&punc; that an Indian called <HI>Wequosh</HI> did direct the English to the Fort at <HI>Mistick,</HI> which <HI>Wequosh</HI> was by birth a Sachim of that place but upon some disgust received he went from the Pequots to the Narra|gansets&punc; and became a chief Captain under <HI>Miantonim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> and that there were with those eighty English Souldiers, who engaged in this expedi|tion against the <HI>Pequots,</HI> at first four hundred Indians, whereof three hundred were <HI>Narragansets.</HI> The day before the fight there was some agitation which Fort should be first assaulted, whether that of <HI>Mistick,</HI> or another eight miles further, where <HI>Sass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acus</HI> himself resided. The English were an end to be upon <HI>Sassacus,</HI> but the Indians were a|fraid saying, that <HI>Sassacus</HI> was <HI>all one God,</HI> and no body could kill him; this made the English yet more desirous to try what power was in this <HI>imaginary Deity,</HI> and that was the conclusion, whereupon many of the <HI>Narragansets&punc;</HI> withdrew, and returned all home, reporting that the En|glish were cut off by the Indians; the same of which was quickly at
<PB N="48" REF="000238_0053_0FA36E2187D22AB0">
Boston; to the great affliction of the English until such time as the truth of things was certainly known. In this <HI>Interim</HI> one of Capt. <HI>Underhils</HI> Souldiers fell lame, not being able to go so far as the place where <HI>Sassa|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> was supposed to be; whence the Captain changed his purpose, and determined for <HI>Mistick;</HI> and Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> was not willing they should part asunder, so did they agree to make their Assault there; few or none of the Indians which were in the Fort escaped, whole companyes of them gathered together and were burnt to death; those that escaped the Fire, the English without the Fort slew them with the sword, so that round about the Fort, dead men lay, hideous to behold.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ah,</HI> even their only Champion, being a man of huge stature was then slain, he brake through the souldiers, and al|though one <HI>Sergeant</HI> stroke him on the neck with his Cutlash, he got by him, and by five souldiers more, but the sixth killed him.</P>
<P>And those that escaped the sword, the friendly Indians that encom|passed the English took as Captives to the number of eighteen.</P>
<P>This was done upon Friday, May, 26. Anno 1637. A Memora|ble Day.</P>
<P>Upon this notable victory <HI>Sassac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> his heart failed him, his men of war being many of them cut off, so that he fled his Country, breaking down his Forts, and burning his Wigwams himself, he marched away by land, with some men, women and Children, their goods being sent away in <HI>Cannoo's.</HI> The English at <HI>Say-brook</HI> had notice of the <HI>Cannoos,</HI> and an advantage to stop their passage, but Capt.<HI>Kilpatrick</HI> delayed until the opportunity was gone, so that <HI>Sassacus</HI> with his routed train coming up to the <HI>Cannoos</HI> six miles from <HI>Say-brook</HI> Fort, was transported over the River, and fled towards <HI>Quinipiack.</HI> Being now inraged he sollicited his men of War, that they might go, and fall upon the English at <HI>Connecticut,</HI> but some of them not consenting, that design of his was not put in execution; he therefore fled to the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> who (being as is supposed excited thereto by the revengfull <HI>Narragansets</HI>) cut off his head.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Pequots</HI> before <HI>Sassacus</HI> his death returned to their Country again; but souldiers being sent from the <HI>Massachusets</HI> the re|turned Pequots were presently distressed, ours ran sacking their country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tling a garrison therein, quickly came back to <HI>Sey|brook,</HI> with one of the Pequot Sachims, and other <HI>Indian</HI> Captives. Af|ter which a supply of men from <HI>Connecticut</HI> coming to the <HI>Massachu|set</HI> Souldiers, they sailed westward in pursuit of the <HI>Pequots</HI> who were fled that way, sailing along to the westward of <HI>Mononowuttuck,</HI> the

wind not answering their desires, they cast Anchor, where two <HI>Sachems</HI> from <HI>Long-Island</HI> came to them, desiring peace and promising to deli|ver up whatever <HI>Pequots</HI> should fly to them for shelter, some scattering <HI>Pequots</HI> were then taken and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain, as also the Pequot <HI>Sachem,</HI> before ex|pressed, had his head cut off, whence that place did bear the name of <HI>Sa|chems head.</HI> Being come near to <HI>Quinipiack</HI> observing a smoak, it was conjectured that the Enemy might be thereabouts, whereupon Indians were set on shore to hunt after them, but they could find no more then two, one of which was the Sachems son of that place, supposed to be Confederate with the <HI>Pequots.</HI> They promised to conduct the Eng|lish to the Enemy, but failed in performance. After that they took a|nother Indian Captive, who likewise engaged to lead the English upon the Pequots, but he directed them into a quite contrary way, for which his life was deservedly taken from him. But an Indian called <HI>Luz,</HI> who was before taken Captive by our Souldiers in the Pequot Country, with two other Indians that were his kinsmen, promised if the English would give him, and his kinsmen their lives, He would conduct them to the Enemies they sought after. He did so, the Pequots with other Indians belonging to those parts, were found near a Swamp, into which they did betake themselves for safety, upon the approach of the English Souldiers. After a while, an Indian came out of the Swamp un|armed, with a present of <HI>Wampam,</HI> The English declared to him that they came not to take away the lives of the Indians nor their goods, if they would deliver up the murtherers that were amongst them. After which ninety nine came forth with their Sachim, who offered as a pre|sent all the Estate he had to dispose of, and that was nothing but the Coat on his back, being a Bears Skin. He was sent into the Swamp again to signify to the Pequots there lurking, that if they would bring forth the murderers it should be better for them, which they would not do, but at last professed they had lived together, and they would dy together</P>
<P>There were about seventy or eighty Indians in the Swamp, amongst whom there were twelve murderers. So then the English besett the Swamp; and shot in upon them, and the Indians at them, some of which were furnished with Guns. One in special that was climbing up a Tree to shoot at the English, was espyed by a Souldier, who sent a Bullet into him before the other could make his shot. In the night time the Indians brake away. Diligent search was the next day made in the Swamp for dead Indians, Not many, (as some have made Nar|ration) but seven, and no more could be found. As for the Captives a
<PB N="50" REF="000238_0055_0FA36E23590C4AE0">
Guard was appointed to look after them, they were charged upon pe|ril of their lives not to attempt running away; yet one of them betook himself to his heels, but a Souldier shot after him, and killed him, which struck a Terror into the rest of the Captives, that no man durst make an offer to escape. These things do I find related by <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onymus,</HI> There is not much more additional to what is expressed in Mr. <HI>Allyns</HI> Narrative, some of these particulars insisted on confirming the truth of that. Only one thing more is conteined therein which I have not elsewhere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with, which therefore it may not be amiss here to take notice of. It is this, Whereas on April 23. 1637. The Indians coming upon the English at <HI>Wethersfield</HI> killed nine persons, and took two young wo|men alive, and carried them away Captives, means were used to effect their deliverance, but at first, in vain.</P>
<P>On May 8. A Dutch Sloop came by <HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort, having on Board an Indian Captive, who said she was <HI>Momonottocks</HI> Squaw. The Eng|lish there desired the Dutch-men to let them have the Squaw in order to redeeming the English Captives, offering to give them to the value of two hundred pound, provided that those Captives might be set at li|berty. The Dutchmen hoping to gain much by such an Indian were some of them lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h to part with her. In Conclusion Capt. <HI>Underhil</HI> (who then commanded the Fort) having obteined the Consent of the Master of the Vessel, did <HI>Vi &amp; armis</HI> take the Squaw out of the Sloop. Afterwards when the <HI>Moheags</HI> came to <HI>Saybrook</HI> that Squaw appeared to be one belonging to them, whom the <HI>Pequots</HI> had Captivated, and she made the Dutch believe she was <HI>Momonottocks Squaw,</HI> hoping that thereby she should obtein the more courteous usage amongst those into whose hands she was fallen, so that the contest between the English and Dutch about her was needless. In the <HI>Interim</HI> the Dutch Governour sent another Sloop, with order to redeem the English Captives if possi|ble, and those Dutch did in Conclusion wilily accomplish their design. For being arrived in the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country, certain Indians coming aboard to trade with them after they had been trafficking they were clapt un|der Hatches, and told they should not be set at liberty, except they would deliver the English&punc; maids that were Captivated, and presently hoysted Sayle, as if they would be gone. The <HI>Pequots</HI> on shore called to them, declaring that if they would come to an Anchor, the English Captives should be brought to them, which was done, and the men whom the Dutchmen had secured in their Sloop given in Exchange for the English Captives, who were also brought safe to <HI>Saybrook,</HI> May, 10. where our Souldiers waited for a wind to carry them to engage with
<PB N="51" REF="000238_0056_0FA36E23D87CE008">
the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and that Wind which for a few dayes kept the English from going upon their expedition, brought that Dutch Sloop to redeem those Captives, concerning whom there was no other hope (and that was a trouble to some) but that the English would be necessitated to de|stroy them amongst the Indians, in the day when their Fort should be attacqued.</P>
<P>Some have thought tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in these Narratives, there is not due notice taken of what was done by the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Forces. The Truth is, the Conquest obteined over the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">equot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was wonderfully the Lords doing, nor may we ascribe much to man therein, yet must it be acknowledged (and the Narratives deny it not) that Capt. <HI>Underhil</HI> (and those under his Command) who was sent from the <HI>Massachusets</HI> did acquit himself worthily, when the Indians at <HI>Mistick</HI> Fort were cut off. It must also be owned that the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Souldiers did glean the <HI>Pequots</HI> af|ter that, (and we know who to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ify those that were unreasonably dissatisfied, was ready to say, <HI>Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better then the Uintage of Abiener;</HI>) Likewise they had an equal hand with others in the Service done at the Swamp, where such a multitude of In|dians were either slain or taken as Captives.</P>
<P>And besides these things insisted on there are who have taken notice of some other specialtyes of Divine providence, relating to those Commotions which have been of momentous consideration, to the peo|ple inhabiting this wilderness, which it may not be amiss here to re|mark. It is then worthy our observation, that the guilty bloody <HI>Pe|quots</HI> after they had treacherously murthered Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> and his Com|pany, brought presents of <HI>Wampam</HI> and <HI>Bever</HI> to the English at <HI>Boston,</HI> desiring their Friendship, pleading that <HI>Stone</HI> had (who was like e|nough to do it) offered some abuse to them, in surprizing divers Indi|ans, and binding them, and forcing them to shew him the way up the River, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;wherefore a peace was concluded upon condition they would suffer the English who desired to inhabit <HI>Connecticut,</HI> there qui|etly to live, and also deliver up those men who had been guilty of <HI>Stones</HI> death. These things were not performed by the <HI>Pequots.</HI> The Rea|son why they were the more willing to have peace with the English was, in that they were fallen out with the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Monhatus,</HI> as also with the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> who were then potent and numerous; and at first they thought scorn to make Overtures of peace to them, proudly designing the subjugation of all their neighbour Indians, which wrought well for the English. Howbeit not unlike him that said,&mdash;<HI>Flectere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i|nequeo superos Ach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ronta movebo.</HI> When they saw they could not attain

their Ends with the English, except they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et Justice have a free passage, and having Contracted fresh bleeding guilt upon them|selves, by new and outragious murthers, and crueltyes, they ear|nestly sollicited the <HI>Narragansets</HI> to joyn with them in their wicked Con|federacy against the English, <HI>Satan</HI> suggesting to them such Arguments as did almost prevail. For they told the <HI>Narragansets</HI> that if they joyned with the English, they did but make way for their own Ruine, since after the <HI>Pequots</HI> were conquered, they would find an occasion to fall upon the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> and that they should not need to come to open battel with the English, only fire their Houses, and kill their Cat|tel, and lye in ambush to shoot them as they went about their occasions, so would they quickly be forced to leave this Country, and the Indians in the mean while not exposed to any great hazard. Had the <HI>Narra|gansets</HI> been overcome by these Arguments, it would have occasioned far greater Trouble and hazard to all the English Colonyes, newly set|led in this Land; But therefore God in mercy to his people prevented it. Commissioners were then sent from <HI>Boston</HI> into the <HI>Narragansett</HI> Country, to endeavour that those Indians might be kept from Comply|ance with the enemy. There is one who having a little enquired into these things, doth <HI>Relate</HI> that the old <HI>Kanonicus</HI> did disswade the Pe|quots from war, advising rather to deliver up the murderers. They made believe as if they would do so, and when a Band of Souldiers was sent into the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country for that end, they bid them stay a while, and the murderers should be brought to them, and certain Indians conversing with our Souldiers, did very much observe the Armor which was upon them&punc; and would point where they should hit them with their Arrows, notwithstanding. In fine, when a great Body of Indians ap|peared on an Hill not far off, those that were with the Souldiers went over to them, when they all came together they gave a scornful shout, and so ran all away, making their boast to others, how they had delu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the English; So that <HI>Canonicus</HI> his advise to the <HI>Pequots</HI> took no effect. After which the <HI>Narragansett,</HI> were not only prevailed with to decline joyning with the enemy, but (as is intimated in the above written Narrative) they pretended they would fight for the English; albeit when it came to in good earnest, they proved themselves Cowards do|ing little against the enemies, except by unmanly insultations when they saw them in misery: For whereas it was customary with the <HI>Pequots,</HI> when they had overcome their enemies insultingly to tri|umph, saying, <HI>O brave Pequots!</HI> The <HI>Narragansets</HI> seeing them wounded or consuming to death in their burning wigwams, would taunt
<PB N="53" REF="000238_0058_0FA36E254864D978">
at them and vaunt over them&punc; saying, <HI>O brave Pequots! O brave Pe|quots!</HI> The more of a divine hand is there to be taken notice of in over|coming the <HI>Pequots</HI> by a small number of English and Indians. Also the <HI>Pequots</HI> were more furnished with Armes then before times they had been; since the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> had sold some Guns to them; and be|sides their bowes and arrows they had an abundance of small hatchets, and <HI>Mohawgs&punc;</HI> hammers made of stone, yet God would not suffer them to find their hands.</P>
<P>What special acts of valour were manifested by any of our <HI>Comman|ders</HI> or souldiers in this expedition, beyond what is expressed in the forementioned <HI>Narrattve,</HI> I am not able to <HI>Relate;</HI> Nor am I (though willing that mens vertues should be duely acknowledged&punc;) disposed to say much on those accounts, respecting such as are yet alive, as know|ing that however it may please some by nourishing a proud humour, it would be nauseous to others, and deemed adulatory by wise and im|partial Readers.</P>
<P>Only I remember Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> (that good man, who was after|wards Commander of the Castle at <HI>Boston,</HI> and there slain by lighten|ing) once told me, that himself, with two or three more, engaged with no lesse then thirty Indians, and that there were seventeen arrows hot into his Coat, but having on a Coat of Male, none of those ar|rows hurt him, only one that happened to strike where he was not de|fended by his Coat.</P>
<P>Also he rescued a poor souldier, that was in extream danger of be|ing devoured by those Wolves; For two Mastive-Indians that lay in ambush, as a party of souldiers passed by, supposing they had been all past, snatched hold of him whom they thought to be the last man, and were running away with him upon their shoulders&punc; Capt. <HI>Daven|port</HI> followed them with his drawn Cutlash, but still as he lifted up his hand to strike at them these <HI>Gigantine Salvages</HI> held up the poor man they were running away with, whereby for a while they secured their own bodyes from the blow, until at last missing the Englishman, Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> smote one of the Indians, whereupon they threw down their prey, and ran for their lives.</P>
<P>He that giveth account of this last passage, doth also <HI>Relate</HI> another particular no lesse pleasant; namely, that whereas the <HI>Pequots</HI> obser|ved, that the English, being willing to shew as much mercy as would stand with justice, did only captivate and not kill the <HI>Squaws,</HI> some great Indian Boyes would cry, <HI>I Squaw, I Squaw,</HI> thereby thinking to escape with their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="000238_0059_0FA36E2608DF6490">
But to be serious. That which Governour <HI>Winthrop</HI> writeth in his Letter, published by Mr. <HI>Morton,</HI> is very memorable, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that in one fight, though the Indians coming up close to our men, shot their Arrows thick upon them, so as to pierce their hat brims, and their Sleeves, and Stockings, and other parts of their Cloaths, yet so miraculously did the Lord preserve them, as that (excepting three that rashly ventur|ed into a Swamp after them) not one of them was wounded. And tru|ly to set aside carnal Considerations, there are two Reasons obvious, that may be assigned as causes of that glorious and speedy success, which God gave to the English against the <HI>Pequot</HI> Indians.</P>
<P N="1">1. The blasphemy of those Enemies. For some of them said, that English mans God was one Flye, which execrable blasphemy the blessed God would not bear from those his Enemies. Also when some English were cruelly tortured to death by them&punc; they would in a way of derision bid them call upon God now, and blasphemously mock at them when they did so. Therefore did the Lord bring those bloody blas|phemers in a moment down to Hell, yea, and damned them above ground, when they lay frying in the Fire that was kindled upon their houses, and making horrible Outcries.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was a mighty Spirit of Prayer and Faith then stirring, both in those that staid at home, and in some what ventured their lives in the high places of the Field. That Reverend man of God Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> (who excelled in those graces of Faith and Love) went forth with the Soul|diers that were sent from this Colony. I think I have my self heard him say, (or if I have not, others have) that <HI>he was before he went out, as certain that God would give the English the Victory over those Ene|mies, as if he had seen the Victory already obtained.</HI> Such great Faith did the Lord stir up in the Heart of that Holy man, and of other his Ser|vants, and by Faith did they <HI>turn to Fight the Armyes of the Aliens.</HI> So then, these Enemies being subdued, in such wayes and by such means as hath been expressed, the Terror of God fell upon all the Heathen round about, and the English were dreadful to them: when they heard that the English had slain, and taken Captive seven hundred Indians, and killed Thirteen <HI>Sachims,</HI> (who are their Kings) there was no more Spirit left in them. The <HI>Pequots</HI> best friends were afraid to receive such as fled to them for Refuge. But happy was he counted that could make friendship with the English, so that two of the <HI>Sachims</HI> in <HI>Long-Island</HI> came to that worthy Gentleman Captain (afterwards Lieut. Colonel) <HI>Stoughton,</HI> entreating that they might be under our protection. Also two of the <HI>Napannet</HI> Sachims, addressed themselves to Governour <HI>Win|throp,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="000238_0060_0FA36E26CA5C9298">
seeking to be in favour with the English. These things de|serve to be mentioned amongst the <HI>Magnalia Dei,</HI> which he hath wrought for his <HI>New-England-People.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being again reduced to this peaceable state, that Land rested from war, and that for the space of almost forty years together. How|beit Jealousies amongst the English grounded upon Treacheries and Conspiracies amongst the Indians, (and some particular acts of Hostility and Outrages by them committed) there have been, more than once or twice, since the <HI>Pequot-Troubles</HI> were ended.</P>
<P>For in Anno 1638. the publick peace was endangered by occasion of a murder committed by an English man upon an Indian. Thus it was. One <HI>Arthur Peach</HI> a young Desperado, who had been a Souldier in the <HI>Pequot</HI> war, and done notable Service, being bold and forward in any desperate Attempt&punc; after he was returned home he was loth to go to work, wherefore he resolved to go to the Dutch Plantation, and enti|ced three persons, that were other mens servants, to run away with him. As they were travailing through the woods, they met a <HI>Narra|ganset Indian,</HI> and desired him to take a pipe of Tobacco, which the In|dian was willing to do, <HI>Peach</HI> told his <HI>Comrades,</HI> be would kill him; they were afraid to do that, but let him alone to do as he would. When he saw his Time, He ran the Indian through with his Rapier, and took away his <HI>Wampam</HI> from him, supposing he had left him dead, but after they were gone, the Indian made a shift to get home, where he dyed of his wound within few dayes; But told other Indians that such and such Englishmen had mortally wounded him; The <HI>Sachims</HI> therefore pre|sently found out these men (only one of them escaped) who had done the murder, and carried them away to the English at <HI>Aquidnet</HI> Island, where they were examined and committed. In the mean time the <HI>Narragansets</HI> were about to rise in Arms, some of them conceiving that they should find the <HI>Pequots</HI> words true, that the English would fall up|on them, now the other were vanquished. To be short, the murder be|ing confessed by the partyes guilty, the Court in <HI>Plymouth</HI> did by ad|vice from Magistrates and elders in the <HI>Bay,</HI> condemn and see executi|on done upon those three <HI>English men</HI> for murdering that one Indian, whereupon the other Indians magnifyed the Justice which they saw amongst the <HI>English,</HI> and peace was continued. Yet after this new fears and troubles did arise upon other accounts. For although the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> and the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eags</HI> did Anno 1638. come under solemn promise that they would not engage in a war, either amongst themselves or with other Indians, until they had advised with, and obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ined appro|bation
<PB N="56" REF="000238_0061_0FA36E2787B530B8">
from the English, Nevertheless <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">antonimo,</HI> the chief <HI>Nar|raganset Sachim,</HI> was continually picking quarrels with the <HI>Moheags,</HI> designing to make them become his Vassals. Some (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Mr. <HI>Gorges</HI> and Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>) have related that <HI>Miantonimo</HI> was set on by certain <HI>vagabond English,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Gortonians,</HI> who being deep Apostates from, and bitter enemies unto the wayes of Christ, professed by our Fathers, might easily be induced to animate motions of that nature, However <HI>Miantonimo</HI> chose rather to accomplish his ends upon the <HI>Moheags</HI> by Treachery, than by open war; and hired a <HI>Pe|quot</HI> Indian who was subjected to <HI>Uncas</HI> (the <HI>Moheags Sachim</HI>) to as|sassinate him that was become his Lord, which the Indian attempted ac|cordingly; insomuch as on a certain evening as <HI>Uncas</HI> was passing from one <HI>Wigwam</HI> to another, he was shot into the arm by an arrow, but recovered the house he intended, without receiving further hurt.</P>
<P>The Indian who was suspected about this matter, being called to an account about a great summ of <HI>Wampam-peag,</HI> by him possessed, could not give any tolerable account, how he came by his money, which augmented jealousies of his being hired by <HI>Miantonimo</HI> to kill <HI>Uncas. Uncas</HI> then made his complaint to the English; the issue was, that <HI>Mi|antonimo</HI> and the suspected Indian came to <HI>Boston,</HI> where he was exami|ned, at first in the presence of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> by whose help he had framed an <HI>Artificial Lye,</HI> saying, that one night as he came out of a thick swamp, <HI>Uncas</HI> desired him to say that he was hired by <HI>Miantonimo</HI> to kill <HI>Uncas,</HI> and that therefore he cut his arm with the flint of his Gun, that men might think he had been shot with an arrow. This pittiful story made the English suspect <HI>Miantonimo</HI> more vehemently then ever, and upon a further private examination (much against <HI>Miantonimo'</HI>s mind) they saw cause to believe that he was secretly designing mischief against the English, as well as against <HI>Uncas.</HI> Nevertheless, it was thought best to dismiss him for the present, only with an engagement to remit the suspected <HI>Pequot</HI> to his Master <HI>Uncas:</HI> He contrary to his promise, as he was returning home cut off the poor <HI>Pequots</HI> head, where|by he was made uncapable of discovering any thing further about matters between <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> and him.</P>
<P>Being come home, he forthwith resolveth to be revenged upon <HI>Uncas,</HI> and with a thousand <HI>Narragansets</HI> gave him battel, but the <HI>Moheags,</HI> (though not half their number) worsted the <HI>Narragan|sets,</HI> and took <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> their chief Sachem, prisoner, and brought him to the Town of <HI>Hartford,</HI> desiring advise from the English con|cerning the disposal of him. The Commissioners of the united Colo|nies,
<PB N="57" REF="000238_0062_0FA36E284A1E5118">
considering that <HI>Miantonimo</HI> had shed blood by raising an unjust war against the <HI>Moheags</HI> their friends, to whom they had engaged protection, &amp; that he was treacherous to the English, &amp; peace not like to be setled among the Indians, nor continued with the English except he were dispatched (together with some other reasons, more fully expressed on the Declaration published by the Commissioners, Anno 1645.) they counselled <HI>Uncas</HI> to put him to death, withal prohibiting him to use any Crueltyes in the manner of his execution, it being customary with barbarous Indians (who like their Father the Devil are delighted in Crueltyes) to put their enemies to the greatest Tortures they can de|vise, when they kill them. The advice was followed. <HI>Vncas</HI> led away <HI>Miantonimo</HI> as if he would carry him to another place, for custody and safety, and by the way very fairly cut off his head, as he not a year be|fore had served one of <HI>Uncas</HI> his men. These things hapned Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1643.</P>
<P>In the next year the peace of two of these Colonies, <ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> those of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New Haven</HI> was disturbed by the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>For, first an English man running away from his Master, out of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> was murdered in the woods near <HI>Connecticut</HI> by an Indian; &amp; about six weeks after was discovered by another Indian, a Sagamore in those parts promised to deliver the murderer bound to the English; and having brought him to <HI>Uncaway</HI> a Connecticut Sachim, he was there unbound, it seems by their joynt consent, &amp; left to shift for himself, where|upon ten English men, who were forthwith sent by Mr. <HI>Ludlow</HI> to the place, seeing the murderer was escaped, laid hold on eight Indians there present, amongst whom there was a Sagamore or two, and kept them in hold two dayes, until four <HI>Sagamores</HI> ingaged themselves within one Moneth to deliver the Malefactor unto Justice; About a week after which agreement an Indian came presumptuously, and in the day time murderously assaulted an English woman, in an house in <HI>Stamford,</HI> and by three wounds (supposed mortal) left her for dead, and robbed the house. The Indians generally in those parts demeaned themselves af|ter an hostile manner refused to come to the English, or to attend Trea|ties of peace, departed from their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> left their Corn unweeded, and shot off Guns near some English Plantations in a Tumultuary way, and some Indians informed that there was a purpose to fall upon the English; so that there was watching and warding day and night, <HI>New-Haven</HI> and <HI>Hartford</HI> were sent unto, that relief might be afforded to the weaker Towns, also application was made to the other Colonyes for Assistance. At last the Indians were perswaded to deliver the murde|rers up to Justice. So did these dark Clouds blow over.
<PB N="58" REF="000238_0063_0FA36E2908706A68">
Nevertheless, in this year (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in Anno 1644.) the Rage of the <HI>Narra|gansets</HI> against the <HI>Moheags</HI> did break out again in greater violence than ever before, insomuch that <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> was forced to betake himself to a Fort, and was there surrounded with multitudes of those Indians. The Eng|lish thought it their concern, not to suffer him, to be swallowed up by those Adversaryes, since he had (though for his own ends) approved himself faithful to the English from time to time. The <HI>Narragansets</HI> perceiving that the English did (as they had Reason to) favour <HI>Un|cas,</HI> began to be high and Insolent in their expressions &amp; actions, threat|ning to destroy the English (only as to the English at <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> the <HI>Narraganset Sachims</HI> concluded a neutrality) as well as the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eags.</HI></P>
<P>Before these things, there being four Colonyes of English Inha|bitants setled in this Country, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Massachusets, Plymouth, Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-Haven,</HI> (which is since become a part of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony) who were sensible of the common danger they were exposed unto, by reason of Indians throughout this Land, as also&punc; in that <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> had seated themselves not far off, who might some of them probably prove evil Neighbours, and withal considering that, as he in the famous Poet expresseth.</P>

<P><HI>Vis unita fortior,</HI> if they were all consederate it would tend to the safety of the whole: Articles of confederation were agreed upon, whence these were called the <HI>United Colonyes:</HI> And now was there an opportunity for them to act as became such; wherefore each of the Colonies did proportionably first send out Souldiers to keep Garrison with <HI>Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as,</HI> and after that ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sed an Army in order to war with the <HI>Narragansets.</HI></P>
<P>When a war was with good advice concluded on, forty men were immediately sent out of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> to relieve <HI>Uncas,</HI> who upon the departure of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Souldiers (their time appointed them to keep Garrison with <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> being expired) was presently set upon by the <HI>Narragansets;</HI> but further attempts upon him were prevented, by the coming of these from the <HI>Massachusets.</HI> Also before the other Colonies could expedite what concerned the whole design, Forces were sent out of Plymouth, under the command of Capt. <HI>Standish,</HI> and mar|ched as far as <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oboth,</HI> that being near the borders of the enemy.</P>

They did solemnly take their leave of their friends, and were solemnly commended to the Blessing of the God of Armies: But as they were just marching out of <HI>Boston,</HI> (their bagg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ge being sent before towards the enemies quarters) many of the principal <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians, <ABBR>viz</ABBR><HI>Pessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, Mexano,</HI> &amp; <HI>Witawash</HI> Sagamores, and <HI>Awasequin</HI> deputy for the <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sticks,</HI> these with a large Train came to <HI>Boston</HI> suing for peace, being willing to submit to what Terms the English should see cause to impose upon them.</P>
<P>It was demanded of them that they should defray the charges that they had put the English to and that the <HI>Sachims</HI> should send their sons to be kept as Hostages in the hands of the English until such time as the money should be payed. All this did the <HI>Narragansets</HI> yield unto,</P>
<P><HI>Mel in ore, verbalactis, Fel in corde frans in factis.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the <HI>Narragansets</HI> have dissembled friendship with the English, yet venome hath been in their hearts ever since these mo|tions: Nor was there any other then <HI>Fides Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> observed by them, in the performance of their engagements.</P>
<P>In the first place they endeavoured to play <HI>Leger de main</HI> in their sending Hostages&punc; For instead of <HI>Sachems</HI> Children&punc; they thought to send some other, and to make the English believe that those base <HI>pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oses,</HI> were of a royal progeny, but they had those to deal with, who were too wise to be so eluded. After the expected <HI>Hostages,</HI> were in the hands of the English, the <HI>Narragansets</HI> notwithstanding that, were flow in the performance of what they stood engaged for. And when upon a partial discharge of the debt, their Hostages were restored to them, they become more backward than formerly, until they were by hostile preparations again and again terrified into better obedience. At last Major <HI>Atherton,</HI> (then Capt. <HI>Atherton</HI>) of <HI>Dorchester</HI> was sent with a small party of English Souldiers to demand what was due. He at first entred into the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> where old <HI>Ninnigret</HI> (the <HI>Nyantick</HI> Sachim) resided, with only two or three Souldiers, appointing the rest by de|grees to follow him, two or three dropping in at once, when his small Company were come about him that Indians in the mean time suppo|sing that there had been many more behind, he caught the Sachim by the hair of his head, and set a pistol to his breast, protesting who ever esca|ped, he should surely dy, if he did not forthwith comply with what was required. Hereupon a great trembling and Consternation surprized the Indians, alb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it multitudes of them were then present, with spiked arrows at their Bow-strings ready to lot fly. The event was, the In|dians

submitted, and not one drop of bloud was shed. Nor was there (so far as I am informed) after this any open discovery of enmity in the <HI>Narragansets</HI> against the English until such time as <HI>Philip</HI> began his his great Rebellion. Yet it is evident that there hath been treachery, and secret Treason against the English, amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>Astutum vapido servant sub pectore Vulpem.</HI></P>
<P>I have been told that a man of God (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Street,</HI> who formerly lived not far from those parts) observing the perfidiousness of those <HI>Narragansets,</HI> and their enmity against the Gospel, publickly decla|red that he foresaw the destruction of the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Nation, solemn|ly confirming his speech in saying, <HI>If God do not destroy that people, then say that his spirit hath not spoken by me.</HI></P>
<P>Surely that holy man was a Prophet, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Qui bene conjiciet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uno Vatem.</HI> And this is a Summary account of what hath in former years hapned between us and the <HI>Narragansets.</HI></P>
<P>Considering, that the <HI>Narraganset Troubles</HI> have been of no small concernment, it would be worth the while a little more fully to relate the Truth about those motions. Only it is already done in good part by that Declaration which was published by the Commissioners of these united Colonies Anno. 1645. (together with the Articles then con|sented unto, and subscribed by the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Sachims) Whoso pleaseth to consult those things will receive satisfaction concerning the <HI>War</HI> which was at that time fully intended, but not actually prosecuted by reason of the Indians Complyance as hath been specified.</P>
<P>In Anno. 1646. They failed in the performance of their Covenant, above expressed, as to every particular therein contained.</P>
<P>It is also evident that they had by presents of <HI>Wampam</HI> been practi|sing with the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and other Indians to engage them against <HI>Un|cas,</HI> unto whom they knew the English had promised protection. So that the English according to the Rules of Righteousness, might have righted themselves by the justice of <HI>War,</HI> yet being desirous rather to ma|nifest Long-suffering towards these Barbarians, the Commissioners of the united Colonies contented themselves with sending a Declaration to the <HI>Narraganset</HI> and <HI>Niantick</HI> Indians, signifying that they should no longer delay the performance of what they had bound themselves unto, as ever they would not be look'd upon as a trracherous and per|fidious people, no more to be treated with.</P>
<P>This Year also there was <HI>Trouble</HI> and fears raised in the Country, by reason of the <HI>River-Indians,</HI> at <HI>Waranoke, &amp; Norwoottuck,</HI> who it seems were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecred&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Death of those famous Worthyes,

Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hains,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whiting</HI> Magistrates in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Co|lony. For I find upon publick <HI>Record,</HI> that complaints and informati|ons about that matter (in September, 1646) were brought before the Commissioners then assembled at <HI>New-haven,</HI> where an Indian testified that <HI>Sequasson</HI> the <HI>Sachim</HI> of <HI>Waranoke,</HI> had given him a sum of money on condition that he would murther the Gentlemen mentioned.</P>
<P>Before the Commissioners convened, Mr. <HI>Haines</HI> had twice sent to <HI>Sequasson;</HI> but he neglected to make his appearance: Wherefore <HI>Jonathan Gilbert</HI> was sent to him again, to signifie from the Commissio|ners that they expected <HI>Sequassons</HI> appearance before them, and to answer what he was accused with, and they promised him free passage both to and from <HI>Newhaven,</HI> withall intimating that his withdrawing himself would greatly augment the suspition of his guilt.</P>
<P>The Messenger quickly returned, bringing word, that he could not speak with <HI>Sequasson,</HI> who he supposed had received notice of his coming by other Indians, and was thereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led.</P>
<P>But a few days after, <HI>Nipnisoit</HI> and <HI>Naimetayhu</HI> two <HI>Sagamores,</HI> came with some other Indians to <HI>Newhaven,</HI> declaring that they were friends to <HI>Sequasson,</HI> and pretended great respect to the English, and that they had brought <HI>Sequasson</HI> to clear himself, and that although one of them had him by one arm, another by the other, when he was come near the town, he brake from them and was escaped.</P>
<P>The Commissioners told them they intended <HI>Sequasson</HI> no hurt; but desired to bring him and his accusers face to face, that he should have a just hearing in their presence.</P>
<P>Some other Indians informed that <HI>Sequasson</HI> was within a mile of <HI>Newhaven,</HI> and it was conceived that he would gladly make his peace by some other means, rather then by a due examination and Trial. The two <HI>Sagamores</HI> said he was much afraid, and durst not come, though they confessed it was just he should come and clear himself, if innocent; all which being considered, the Commissioners conceived that <HI>Sequasson</HI> whether guilty or afraid of the English, would still be plotting against them and so prove dangerous; wherefore they thought fit, and ordered that all just and prudent means should be used (his life being preserved) to bring him to a tryal, that the matter might be some way issued. In the mean time they thought good to examine <HI>Wotchiborow</HI> a <HI>Pocatuck</HI> Indian <HI>Sequassons</HI> accuser, who waited to give in evidence against him. He being warned by <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> the Interpreter, to speak nothing but truth) affirmed, that being this last Spring at <HI>Waranoke,</HI> in a wig|wam with <HI>Sequasson,</HI> and ready to depart, <HI>Sequasson</HI> perswaded him to
<PB N="62" REF="000238_0067_0FA36E2C083FC930">
stay three days, thence he drew him to the <HI>Falls</HI> above Mr. <HI>Pinchous;</HI> when they had been there four dayes, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hiborow</HI> would have been gone to <HI>Moheag,</HI> to see some friends; <HI>Sequasson</HI> told him it was dange|rous travelling that way, he would be killed, walked along with him to a Spring, and there told him, that if ever he would doe the said <HI>Se|quasson</HI> a kindness, now was a time, he was almost ruined, and the En|glish at <HI>Hartford,</HI> the cause of it: He should therefore go to <HI>Hart|ford</HI> and kill Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hains,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whiting</HI> and he would give him a reward, and thereupon pluckt out of his bag three gir|dles of <HI>Wampam,</HI> and gave them to him, with a piece of a girdle of <HI>wam|pam</HI> to play, and promised him much more. <HI>Wotchiborow</HI> said it was dangerous to kill an English <HI>Sachim,</HI> they would find out the murde|rer and pursue him to death; what could then <HI>wampam</HI> doe him good? <HI>Sequasson</HI> said he had store of <HI>wampam,</HI> when the thing was done they would fly to the <HI>Mohawkes,</HI> but in the way, when they came to the <HI>Wampeag-Indians,</HI> he should give it out that <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> had hired him for so much <HI>wampam,</HI> and that would set the English against <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> &amp; then he the said <HI>Sequasson</HI> should rise again.</P>
<P>He further told this <HI>Examinate,</HI> that <HI>Naymetayhu,</HI> one of the fore|mentioned <HI>Sagamores</HI> that came on the behalf of <HI>Sequasson,</HI> and his fa|ther, knew and approved of the said murther.</P>
<P><HI>Wotchiborow</HI> further saith that having taken the aforesaid <HI>wampam,</HI> he remembred that himself had formerly taken <HI>Busheag,</HI> and brought him to the English, who for a murderous attempt at <HI>Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ford</HI> was put to death at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> that if he should kill any English Sachim, he should goe in fear of death all the dayes of his life, and that for bring|ing in <HI>Busheag,</HI> he had a Gratuity from the English, and for the disco|very of this plot he should have their favour&punc; and he thought the fa|vour of the English with security, would be better to him then <HI>Sequassons Wampam</HI> with fear and danger; he therefore came first to <HI>Tunks<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and the next day to <HI>Hartford,</HI> and discovered <HI>Sequasions</HI> pra, ctice.</P>
<P>He said further, that <HI>Sequasson</HI> hearing of the discovery, spake to <HI>Romanoke</HI> an Indian, and he sent another Indian called <HI>Sixpence</HI> to this Examinate, desiring him to hide and conceal as much of the Plot as he could&punc; and not to lay all open, but he in anger bad the said <HI>Sixpence</HI> hold his peace, he had discovered it, and would hide nothing.</P>
<P>Thus much doe I find upon Record, relating to <HI>Sequassons</HI> plot. What afterwards came of this business, or how it issued, I cannot say. There was also another trouble about the Indians this year.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="000238_0068_0FA36E2CC7C8FF08">
For whilst the Commissioners were sitting at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> petitions were presented from <HI>Edward Elmere</HI> and some others, complaining that In|dians had wilfully and maliciously burned some quantity of pitch, and Tarr of theirs, together with some bedding, and a Cart with its furni|ture, and tooles &amp;c. in value above an hundred pounds. And particu|larly they complained of one <HI>Wasemose,</HI> a <HI>Waranoke</HI> Indian as guilty therein, as by sufficient evidence they thought they could prove; and that he hath since avoided all the English Plantations; and that he being sent for by a warrant from one of the Magistrates of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> fled; but being overtaken and seized by some of the English, he was rescued by the Indians, and the English by them jeered and abused, and particu|larly <HI>Chickwallop</HI> Sachim of <HI>Norwootuck:</HI> Whereupon <HI>Jonathan Gilbert</HI> and <HI>John Grissin,</HI> were sent to <HI>Chickwallop and Manasanes.</HI></P>
<P>At their return, they informed that they could not meet either with <HI>Chickwallop</HI> or <HI>Manasanes,</HI> but the <HI>Sagamores</HI> and Indians at <HI>Wara|noke</HI> carried it insolently towards the English, vaunting themselves in their Arms, bows and Arrows, hatchets and Swords, some with their Guns ready charged, before and in the presence of the English Mes|sengers, they primed and cockt them ready to give fire, and told them, that if they should offer to carry away any men thence, the Indi|ans were resolved to sight, yet the next morning the <HI>Sachim</HI> with some others offered the English Messengers eight Fathom of <HI>Wampam</HI> to|wards satisfaction, and promised to provide more. The Messengers not having any thing to that purpose in their Commission, advised the <HI>Sachim</HI> to send to the Commissioners, but he refused. Hereupon, <HI>Naymetayhu</HI> one of the <HI>Sagamores</HI> of <HI>Waranoke,</HI> who, as before, came on <HI>Sequasson&punc;</HI> behalf, was questioned by the Commissioners about these proud Affronts to the English; At first he denyed what was charged, and excused some part, but one of the English Messengers being pre|sent, and he hearing the rest should be sent for, he fell under most of the charge, professing that he intended no harm to the English, Thus concerning disturbance by the Indians in the yerr, 1646.</P>
<P>In Anno, 1647. New fears and troubles arose by reason of the <HI>Nar|raganset</HI> Indians, there being credible Informations that they were plot|ting, and by presents of <HI>Wampam</HI> ingaging the Indians round about to combine with them against the English Colonyes, insomuch that a meet|ing of the Commissioners was called before the ordinary time; Being therefore convened at <HI>Boston,</HI> July 26. A Messenger was sent to <HI>Nar|raganset,</HI> signifying to <HI>Pesicut</HI> and other <HI>Sachims</HI> there, that the English Commissioners expected their appearance at <HI>Boston,</HI> and that if they
<PB N="64" REF="000238_0069_0FA36E2DD713F198">
did refuse or delay, they should no more be sent unto, withal promising them safe conduct, inCase they duly attended. The Messenger being returned informed that <HI>Pesicus</HI> excused his not meeting the Com|missioners at <HI>New Haven</HI> the last year, from his ignorance of the time. when he should attend, though that was falsly pretended by him. He also desired excuse for his not appearing at this time, be|cause he said he was sick, and not able to come, (but the Messengers could not perceive that he was subject to any such sickness or disable|ment) Nevertheless, he had given full power to <HI>Ninnigret</HI> to act on his behalf. Moreover, he excused his not performing the <HI>Articles</HI> he had subscribed at <HI>Boston,</HI> two years before, by pretending that he was frighted into that Engagement, with the sight of the English Army, which was then ready to invade the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country, and he thought they would follow him home, and there kill him if he did not promise to do as the English would have him.</P>
<P>August <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Ninnigret</HI> with some <HI>Niant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck</HI> Indians, and two of <HI>Pes|si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> his men came to <HI>Boston.</HI> At first he (though against his Consci|ence) made as if he were ignorant, and never been informed of the Covenant which the Indians had made to the English, and seemed to wonder that the English should ask such a Sum of <HI>Wampam,</HI> saying that he knew not that the Indians were in the Englishmens Debt. He was then put in mind, how that formerly satisfaction had been deman|ded of the Indians for the breach of Articles; and how the English Mes|sengers had been ill intreated by them, and particularly by himself, who had used threatning and insolent, language, saying to the Mes|sengers, that he knew the Commissioners would endeavour to keep them from warring upon <HI>Uncas,</HI> but they were resolved they would do it for all that, and nothing but <HI>Uncas</HI> his head should satisfy them; and that if the English did not withdraw their Garrisons from the De|fence of <HI>Uncas,</HI> they would heap up their Cattel as high as their <HI>wig|wams,</HI> and that he was the man that had given out that an Englishman should not step out of doors to piss but they would kill him. <HI>Ninigre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> not being able to deny these charges, and somewhat appalled thereat, began to comply with the reasonable demands of the English. A dayes time was allowed to him for Consideration and advice with the rest of the Indian Deputyes that were then in <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>The next day he declared that he was resolved to give the English Colonies due Satisfaction in all things, and that he would forthwith send some of his men to gather up the <HI>wampam</HI> which was yet behind hoping that within ten dayes it might be obtained, and that himself
<PB N="65" REF="000238_0070_0FA36E2E53DF18E0">
would stay with the English as security, untill the money was paid. Ac|cordingly, he dispatched his Messengers home for that end, who not many dayes after, came back to <HI>Boston,</HI> bringing with them two hun|dred fathom of <HI>Wampam,</HI> towards satisfaction of what they owed to the English. This falling very much short of what was expected, <HI>Ni|nigree</HI> pleaded that his personal absence from home was the cause of that defect, and therefore desired liberty to go home, withal adding, that if the whole were not paid by next spring, the English should take his head, and seize his Country. The Commissioners let him depart, and since he pretended so fair, did deliver to him the Children which were kept as <HI>Hostages,</HI> expecting from him, the more care to see engage|ments performed; and if they did find him real, that then former neg|lects should be charged upon <HI>Pesic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and that they should expect his assistance, when it should be required, in recovering the whole remain|der from <HI>Pesicus,</HI> all which things were cheerfully accepted by <HI>Ninni|gret.</HI></P>
<P>This year other <HI>Troubles</HI> hapned by some of <HI>Vncas</HI> his Indians, who committed several Outrages upon the English in the <HI>Pequot</HI> Country. Mr. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> &amp; some with him, complained that <HI>Wowequay</HI> (<HI>Un|cas</HI> his brother) with about forty <HI>Moheags,</HI> behaved themselves inso|lently hovering against the English Plantation in a suspicious manner, to the afrightment of the Inhabitants there; Also, although <HI>Uncas</HI> at first seemed gladly to entertain the English plantation at <HI>Pequot,</HI> yet his carriage since was such as if he designed by <HI>Alarums</HI> to disturb and break that plantation. In fine, <HI>Uncas</HI> was censured, and required to ac|knowledge his fault to the English plantation, (which he did) and pay an hundred Fathom of <HI>Wampam</HI> to make amends for wrongs susteined.</P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> 1648. New complaints were brought before the Com|missioners of the united Colonyes, (then sitting at <HI>Plymouth</HI>) against the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians <HI>Henry Bull</HI> of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> petitioned for re|lief, informing that those Indians had beaten him, and other wayes been injurious to him. Also Messengers from the Town of <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wick</HI> came with complaints in behalf of the whole Town, alleadging that their neighbour Indians did kill their Cattel, abuse their servants when they took them alone,&amp; sometimes would make forcible entry into their hou|ses, yea&punc; and strike the masters thereof, and steal, and purloyne their goods at pleasure. At the same time, informations were brought before the Commissioners, that the <HI>Narragansit</HI> Indians, instead of paying the <HI>Wampam,</HI> that was due to the Colonyes, had improved their <HI>Wampam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> o hire Indians to invade <HI>Uncas,</HI> and in case the English should defend

him, to fight with them also. Particularly, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Ninnigret</HI> had given out, that if the English did protect <HI>Uncas,</HI> he would quickly burn the houses at <HI>Connecticut.</HI> The <HI>Narragansets</HI> were withdrawing their old men, women, and children into swamps, hiding their corn <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The mercenary <HI>Mohawks</HI> were said to be about four hundred in number, all armed with guns, and three pound of powder for every man.</P>
<P>These Counsils were so far ripened and prepared for execution, as that <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> and other messengers from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> goeing to the Indians to enquire into&punc; and (if it might be) stop proceedings, found them met at <HI>Pacomptuck</HI> their Randeavouze, who acknowledg|ed that they had received <HI>Wampam</HI> from the <HI>Narragansets</HI> to invade <HI>Uncas,</HI> and that they were met together to that purpose, expecting <HI>Mohawks</HI> and other Indians to make up their full numbers: But hea|ring that two <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachims, were lately killed by the Eastern In|dians, and that the English, who they thought were a just and war|like people, would defend <HI>Uncas,</HI> they did therefore stop their inten|ded proceedings at this time.</P>
<P>But these things made it yet more evident, that the <HI>Narragansetts</HI> were a false and treacherous people, not to be trusted, nor worthy to be treated with.</P>
<P><HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> 1649. <HI>Newhaven</HI> Colony was in apparent danger of being involved in trouble by reason of the Indians there: For at <HI>Stamford</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> going forth to seek his cattle returned not home as was expected, nor could be found by the English that sought for him; but quickly after the Son of a <HI>Sagamore</HI> who lived near <HI>Stamford,</HI> came into the Town, and told the English that <HI>John Whitmore</HI> was murthered by an Indian called <HI>Toquattos,</HI> and to prove it, told them that <HI>Toquattos</HI> had some of his cloathes; and particularly his shirt made of Cotton-linnen. Hereupon the English and some Indians went into the woods to seek the murthered body for burial, but though they bestowed much time and labour, they could not find it. Diverse of the English at <HI>Stamford</HI> suspected the <HI>Sagamores</HI> son to be either the Author or accessory to the Murther, but had not satisfiing grounds to seize and charge him.</P>
<P>About two or three months after, <HI>Uncas</HI> coming to <HI>Stamford,</HI> calling the Indians thither, and enquiring after the murdered body, the fore mentioned <HI>Sagam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">res</HI> Son, and another suspected Indian called <HI>Kehoron</HI> fell a trembling, and hereby confirmed the suspition of the English, and wrought a suspition in some of the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Indians, so that they said these two Indians were <HI>Match<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> meaning they were guilty. Notwith|standing the Indians thereabouts excused the <HI>Sagamores</HI> Son, and accu|sed

<HI>Toq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">attos,</HI> &amp; intimated that if the Sagamores Son should upon sus|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ition be seized on by the English, the Indians would doe the like by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me English, untill he should be set at liberty.</P>
<P>Likewise as <HI>South-ham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton</HI> in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> the English were exposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great difficulties and dangers by reason of a murder committed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">at Town, so that they were necessitated to <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> themselves, and stand upon their own defence for many dayes; the Indians being gathered to|gether in an hostile posture. This year also <HI>Uncas</HI> renewed his com|plaints against the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indians, that notwithstanding all former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngagements, they are still undermining his peace, and seeking his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uine, and in particular that to their late endeavour to bring the <HI>Mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">awks</HI> upon him, when that failed, they sought by witchcraft to take a|way his life. A <HI>Narraganset</HI> Indian (called <HI>Cuitaquin</HI>) in an English Vessel in <HI>Mohegin</HI> River, ran a Sword into <HI>Uncas</HI> his breast, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> received to all appearance a mortal wound, which murderous act, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Assailant then confessed, he was for a considerable sum of <HI>Wampam,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y the <HI>Narraganset</HI> and <HI>Niantick</HI> Sachims hired to attempt, <HI>Ninnigret</HI> when examined utterly denyed his having an hand in that fact but affir|med that <HI>Cuttaquin,</HI> who accused himself, and the other Sachims, was drawn thereunto, by Torture from the <HI>Moheags,</HI></P>
<P>About four years after this (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in Anno 1653.) there were great <HI>Troubles,</HI> and Commotions raised in the Spirits of men with reference to the Indians, it being generally believed that there was an horrid Conspi|racy amongst the Indians throughout this Land to cut off all the Eng|lish, and that they were animated thereto by the Dutch, there being at that time war between England and Holland. An Indian <HI>Squaw</HI> was sent by other Indians (that professed love and friendship) to one in <HI>Wethersfield</HI> on <HI>Connecticut,</HI> informing that there was a Confederacy between the Dutch and indians, to destroy the English Colonyes, and that the day of Election of Magistrates in the several Jurisdictions was intended for execution, because then the Towns would be left naked and less able to defend themselves. This Squaw moreover desired the English to remember, how dear their slighting of her former informati|on of the <HI>Pequots</HI> coming had cost them.</P>
<P>Also. <HI>Uncas</HI> addressed himself to the Governour of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Co|lony declaring that <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nnigr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> had that winter been at <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atos,</HI> and that he had given the Dutch Governour a great present of <HI>Wampam,</HI> and received from him twenty Gunns, with powder and shot answer|able;
<PB N="68" REF="000238_0073_0FA36E30893095B8">
and that during his stay in those parts he went over <HI>Hudsons</HI> River, gathered as many <HI>Sachims</HI> together as he could, made ample Declaration against the English, desiring their aid and assistance against them.</P>
<P>Yea moreover, there were no less then nine Indian <HI>Sagamores,</HI> who lived near <HI>Manhatos,</HI> did voluntarily without any notice or reward from the English, send their Messengers to <HI>Stamford,</HI> declaring and af|firming (even after they were urged by the English to testifie nothing but the truth) that the Dutch had sollicited them by promising them Gunns, Swords, Powder, Wampam, Wast-coats and Coats to cut off the English. The Messengers added that they would not lye, &amp; were as the mouth of the nine Sagamores, who <HI>All speak they no lye,</HI> they would affirm it to the Dutch Governours face, and if the Dutch were angry, and should fight with them&punc; <HI>No force &amp;c.</HI> The next day, one of those Sagamores, with the Son and Brother of another of them came themselves to <HI>Stamford,</HI> and confirmed what their Messengers in their names had before reported.</P>
<P>This Spring also, the Indians in the <HI>Northern &amp; Eastern</HI> parts gene|rally grew insolent, and their carriage very suspitious, and they gave out threatning words, so that many Alarms were made, the peace of the English through the whole Country disturbed, they wearied with ex|traordinary Watchings and Wardings, hindred in their Plowing, Sow|ing preparations for Planting and other Occasions, to their exceeding great Damage. These things caused many sad thoughts of hearts, and some warlike Preparations; but when the Partyes accused were enqui|red of about these matters they would own nothing; as for <HI>Ninigret</HI> he pretended that his wintering amongst the Dutch was on the account of his health, and not at all out of design against the English. The rest of the <HI>Narraganset Sachims</HI> made themselves very ignorant of any Plot; the Dutch Governour likewise professed great abhorrency of so vile a thing as that would be, to hire barbarous Indians to murder Christians; withall adding, that if the Colonies fell upon him on that account, the righteous Judge would be his Defence, and that,
<Q><LG>
<L>&mdash;<HI>Hic murus aheneus esto</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nil conscire sibi null&acirc; pallescere culp&acirc;.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
Also glad tidings of peace between the Nations at home arrived here so did these troubles vanish.</P>
<P>Albeit not many years after these things, the Indians in those parts made an horrible slaughter, not of English-men but of Dutch-men, who were treacherously massacred by them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="000238_0074_0FA36E314AB43FE8">
In the latter end of this year it was, that the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">taukes</HI> or Long|Island Indians who were friends and Tributaryes to the English, com|plained that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> and the <HI>Nianticks</HI> had assaulted them, killing and taking Captive diverse of them. They were so far hearkned un|to, as that the Commissioners of the united Colonies did apprehend themselves called of God to wage Warr against <HI>Ninigret,</HI> and such Indians as should adhere to him in his bloudy proceedings, and accor|dingly did by vote conclude and determine the same, and that two hundred and fifty Souldiers should be forthwith raised, and sent forth by the several Colonies. But the Council at <HI>Boston</HI> not concurring in those Conclusions, the intended expedition failed at that time. Ne|vertheless the next year, it being known that <HI>Ninnigret</HI> persisted in his Warring upon the Long Islanders, and that he brake his Covenant, refusing to pay tribute for those <HI>Pequots</HI> that were by the English for|merly placed under him, and that the lenity of the Colonies was ab|used to heighten his pride and insolency; upon these Considerations it was agreed by the Commissioners that there should be two hundred and seventy Foot Souldiers, and forty Horse, raised out of the several Colo|lonyes, in order to reducing <HI>Ninnigret</HI> to subjection and better obedi|ence. Accordingly Forces were forthwith levied, and a small Army sent forth under the Christian and couragious Major <HI>Willard</HI> as Com|mander in chief.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of the English Army <HI>Ninnigret</HI> fled from the place of his usual Residence, and got into a Swamp, where it was not casie to pursue him. Most of the <HI>Pequots</HI> under his Jurisdiction then deser|ted him, and came to the English. Messengers were sent to demand a Treaty with him, but he was afraid to appear.</P>
<P>In fine, two Gentlemen, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> and Capt. <HI>Siely</HI> went to him requiring the delivery of the rest of the <HI>Pequots;</HI> to whom he replyed that they were gone on hunting, but ingaged that within seven dayes they should be delivered to Mr. <HI>Winthrop.</HI> He was moreover charged to forbear all acts of Hostility against the Long-Islanders, or any other Indians that were in amity with the English; and plainly told, that if he did not hearken to the advice and charge laid upon him, he must expect that ere long his head would be set upon an English pole.</P>
<P>So did the Messengers return and the Army also. These things hap|ned in October Anno 1654.</P>
<P>After the English forces were withdrawn, <HI>Ninnigret</HI> did according to his usual manner, observe <HI>Fidem punicam</HI> in keeping the promises which at that time he had made and set his hand unto.</P>

Not many years after this the Indians in the Southern and Western parts of this Land were involved in broyles amongst themselves, raging with implacable feuds and wars one against another. The <HI>Nianticks, Maunta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kets, Mohegins, Norwootucks,</HI> all engaged in cruel and bloody quarrels. And the peace of these Colonyes was not a little disturbed and endangered thereby, inasmuch as the Indians would pursue one a|nother to the English plantations, and sometimes into the English hou|ses, and there kill one another. Some English at <HI>Wethersfield,</HI> and some inhabiting in the <HI>Moheag</HI> Country were by means here of put in|to sad frights. In special, in Anno 1658, sundry English in divers pla|ces were disquieted by the insolence and outrage of the <HI>Pacumptick</HI> In|dians. But when the <HI>Sachims</HI> were called to an account about it, they pretended that they were ignorant of what disorders were committed by their men, nor allowed of by them who desired to live in amity with the English, and were willing to give satisfaction for past injuryes, and to prevent the like abuses for the Future. So did those Troubles pass over. Not very long before this, at <HI>South-Hampton</HI> in <HI>Long Island</HI> some houses had been burned by a wicked Indian (and a <HI>Negro</HI> wo|man) who it seems after he had done this wickedness, desperately killed himself, to prevent just execution. It was at first thought that more of the Indians there had had an hand in that burning, whence they were condemned to pay seven hundred pound in seven years, but afterwards that penalty was taken off, since it was judged unreasona|ble that those Indians who were not proved to act in, or consent to the mischief that was done, should be made to suffer as guilty.</P>
<P>In Anno 1662, <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony was in some danger of being invol|ved in Trouble by the <HI>Wam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anoag</HI> Indians. After <HI>Massasoit</HI> was dead, his two sons, called <HI>Wamsutta,</HI> &amp; <HI>Metacomet,</HI> came to the court at <HI>Plymouth</HI> pretending high respect for the English&punc; and therefore desired English names might be imposed on them, whereupon the Court there named <HI>Wamsutta</HI> (the elder brother) <HI>Alexander,</HI> and <HI>Metacomet</HI> (the younger brother) <HI>Philip;</HI> this <HI>Alexander</HI> (<HI>Philips</HI> immediate predecessor) was not so faithful and friendly to the English as his Father had been. For some of <HI>Boston</HI> having been occasionally at <HI>Narraganset,</HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> who was then Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> that <HI>Alexander</HI> was contri|ving mischief against the English, and that he had sollicited the <HI>Nar|ragangansets</HI> to ingage with him in his designed rebellion. Hereupon, Capt. <HI>Willet</HI> (who lived near to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> the place where <HI>Alex|ander</HI> did reside) was appointed to speak with him and to desire him to attend the next Court in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> for their satisfaction, and his own
<PB N="71" REF="000238_0076_0FA36E32C9119438">
vindication, he seemed to take the message in good part, professing that the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> who (he said) were his enemies, had put an abuse upon him&punc; and he readily promised to attend at the next Court. But when the day for his appearance was come, instead of that, he at that very time went over to the <HI>Narragansets</HI> his pretended enemies, which compared with other Circumstances, caused the Gentlemen at <HI>Plymouth</HI> to suspect there was more of Truth in the Information given, than at first they were aware of. Wherefore the Governour and Magistrates there, ordered Major <HI>Winslow</HI> (who is since and at this day the Governour of that Colony) to take a party of men, and fetch down <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Major considering that <HI>semper nocuit differre parat is,</HI> he took but ten armed men with him from <HI>Marshfield,</HI> intending to have taken more at the Towns that lay nearer <HI>Mount-Hope.</HI> But divine providence so ordered, as that when they were about the midway between <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Briagwater,</HI> observing an hunting house, they rode up to it, and there did they find <HI>Alexander</HI> and many of his men well armed, but their Guns standing together without the house, the Major with his small party, possessed themselves of the Indians Arms, and beset the house; then did he go in amongst them, acquainting the <HI>Sachim</HI> with the rea|son of his coming in such a way, desiring <HI>Alexander</HI> with his Interpre|ter to walk out with him, who did so a little distance from the house, and then understood what Commission the <HI>Major</HI> had received con|cerning him. The proud <HI>Sachim</HI> fell into a raging passion at this sur|prise, saying that the Governour had no reason to credit Rumors, or to send for him in such a way&punc; nor would he go to <HI>Plymouth</HI> but when he saw cause. It was replyed to him, that his breach of word touching ap|pearance at <HI>Plymouth</HI> Court, and instead thereof going at the same time to his pretended enemies, augmented jealousies concerning him. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fine, the <HI>Major</HI> told him, that his order was to bring him to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that (by the help of God) he would do it, or else he would dy on the place; Also declaring to him that if he would submit, he might ex|pect respective usage, but if he once more denyed to go, he should ne|ver stir from the ground whereon he stood, and with a Pistol at the <HI>Sa|chims</HI> breast, required that his next words should be a positive and clear Answer to what was demanded. Hereupon his Interpreter (a discreet Indian, brother to <HI>John Sausaman</HI>) being sensible of <HI>Alexanders</HI> passionate disposition, entreated that he might speak a few words to the <HI>Sachim,</HI> before he gave his Answer. The prudent discourse of this Indian pre|vailed so far as that <HI>Alexander</HI> yielded to go, only requesting that he might go like a <HI>Sachim,</HI> with his men attending him, which (although
<PB N="72" REF="000238_0077_0FA36E3387A7BB68">
there was some hazard in it, they being many, and the English but a few) was granted to him. The weather being hot, the Major offered him and horse to ride on, but his squaw and diverse Indian women be|ing in company, he refused, saying he could go on foot as well as they, entreating only that there might be a complying with their place, which was done, and resting several times by the way, <HI>Alexander</HI> and his Indi|ans were refreshed by the English; no other discourse hapning while they were upon their march, but what was pleasant and amicable. The <HI>Major</HI> sent a man before, to entreat that as many of the Magi|strates of that Colony as could; would meet at <HI>Duxbury;</HI> wherefore ha|ving there had some treaty with <HI>Alexander,</HI> not willing to commit him to prison, they entreated Major <HI>Winslow</HI> to receive him to his house, until the Governour (who then lived at <HI>Eastham</HI>) could come up. Accor|dingly he and his Train were courteously entertained by the Major. And albeit not so much as an angry word passed between them whilst at <HI>Marshfield,</HI> yet proud <HI>Alexander</HI> vexing and fretting in his spirit, that such a check was given him, he sudeenly fell sick of a fever. He was then nursed as a choice friend. Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> (the Physitian) coming providentially thither at that time, the Sachim and his men earnestly desired that he would administer to him, which he was unwilling to doe, but by their importunity was prevailed with to doe the best he could to help him, and therefore gave him a potion of working Physick, which the Indians thought did him good; but his distemper afterward prevailing, they entreated to dismiss him, in order to a return home, which upon engagement of appearance at the next Court was granted to him, soon after his being returned home, he dyed.</P>
<P>And this is the truth and substance of what concerns Transactions with <HI>Alexander,</HI> concerning which so many fabulous storyes have been spread abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> being dead, his Brother <HI>Philip</HI> (of late cursed memory) rose up in his stead, and he was no sooner styled <HI>Sachim,</HI> but immedi|ately in the year 1662. there were vehement suspitions of his bloudy treachery against the English: Yet he professed otherwise, and ma|king his personal appearance at a Court holden at Plymouth, renewed that Covenant which his father and Brother had confirmed with the English there. This Covenant he per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idiously brake: For in Anno 1671. it was evident that he with other his Confederates had been conspiring against the Colony, under whose protection and Jurisdicti|on he had submitted himself. He then armed himself and acted like a Rebel that intended a speedy rising, yea he ordered (as some Indians
<PB N="73" REF="000238_0078_0FA36E3448112B98">
have since confessed) that if the English did send messengers to Treat with him, if above four came in company together they should be shot down, and appointed some to ly in ambush for that end; and behaved himself after a surly and provoking manner towards messengers that de|sired Treaty with him, and refused to appear, and give answer for his Insolencyes, his Covenant notwithstanding. Nevertheless, he at last conceded to meet the Governour and Magistrates of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> at <HI>Taun|ton;</HI> where sundry Commissioners of <HI>Boston</HI> were desired to be, and to hear the matters of difference between the English of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and this <HI>Philip</HI> Sachim.&mdash;This meeting was attended in <HI>April,</HI> 1671. when <HI>Philip</HI> confessed his breach of Covenant, and that he had groundlesly taken up Arms against them, whom he had alwayes found friendly to him; And surrendred some of his Arms, engaging for the delivery of the rest in due time. The English being tender of shedding blood, let him go upon promise of better behaviour for the future. Soon after this, <HI>Philip</HI> (with some of his Counsellors) repaired to <HI>Boston,</HI> endea|vouring to possess the English there, with lying Informations, about In|juryes done to him by those of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Wherefore the Council of that Colony entreated that Commissioners from <HI>Boston,</HI> and from <HI>Con|necticut</HI> also might be sent to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> that so a fair hearing of diffe|rences before all the world might be attended. So then in <HI>September</HI> following the Governour of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and several Magistrates from the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and some other Gentlemen met at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where <HI>Philip</HI> appeared, and all his allegations were heard to the Conviction of <HI>Philip</HI> himself, and great satisfaction of all that Audience. The con|clusion was, <HI>Philip</HI> acknowledged his offence, and was appointed to give a sum of mony to defray the charges which his Insolent Clamours had put that Colony unto. The particulars which <HI>Philip</HI> then consent|ed to were these.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he would for the future be subject to the Government of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and to their Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. He engaged to pay the Colony an hundred pound towards repa|ration of such wrong as they had susteined by his misdemeanors.</P>
<P N="3">3. He was under obligation to send five wolves heads every year to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in Token of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alty.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he would not make war with any without the approbation of that Government.</P>
<P N="5">5. In case any future difference should arise between him and the English, he would repair to the Government there to rectify matters, before ingaging in any hostile attempts.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="74" REF="000238_0079_0FA36E3509414340">
6. That he would not dispose of any of his Lands but with the appro|bation of the English government there&punc; So was he dismis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. Some of these Covenants were in part observed by him, and some particulars not at all&mdash;Thus did things rest between the English and him, until the year 1674. when in <HI>January</HI> an Indian Preacher, known by the name of <HI>John Sausaman,</HI> addressed himself to the present Governour of <HI>Pli|mouth,</HI> informing him that the Indians were compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tting the de|struction of the English, and that not only the <HI>Wompanoags,</HI> but the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> yea and the <HI>Mohegins</HI> were involving themselves in this Conspiracy. This <HI>Sansaman</HI> was by birth a <HI>Massachuset,</HI> his Father and Mother living in <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and they both died Christians. This their Son did for some time apostatize from his Christian profession, and lived like an Heathen, being Philips Secretary (for he could write a ve|ry legible hand) and one of his Counsellors, untill at last God convinced him of his misery, and he manifested such evident signs of repentance as that he was, after his return from pagan <HI>Philip,</HI> reconciled to the praying Indians and baptised, and received as a member in one of the Indian Churches, yea and imployed as an Instructor amongst them every Lords Day. Nevertheless, his information (because it had an In|dian original, and one can hardly believe them when they speak truth) was not at first much regarded, untill by relation of Circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, he made it too apparent, that <HI>Philip</HI> was really hatching mischief. The effect was, the Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> advising with his Councill, resol|ved once more to send for <HI>Philip,</HI> and to enquire into the truth of things: But before that could be accomplished, an Indian called <HI>Tobi|as,</HI> with his Son, and another Indian named <HI>Matta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hinnamy,</HI> meeting with <HI>John Sausaman</HI> at a pond, cruelly murthered him; and that their villany might not be discovered, they cut an hole through the Ice, and put in the dead murthered Body, leaving his hat and Gun upon the Ice, that so others might think that he had drowned himself. It be|ing rumor'd that <HI>Sausaman</HI> was lost, the dead body was sought after, and found in the pond, and taken up and buried.</P>
<P>Jealousies being on the spirits of men that the other Indians had murthered him, on the account of revealing their Conspiracyes to the English: The Governour of <HI>Plymouth</HI> ordered the Constable of <HI>Mia|a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bury</HI> (that being the nearest town to the Place where the murther was committed) to cause <HI>John Sausamans</HI> body to be taken up again, and to empanel a Jury as a <HI>Coroners Inquest,</HI> to make enquiry how he came by his death: And they found that he had been murthered, for his neck was broken by twisting of his head round; which is the
<PB N="75" REF="000238_0080_0FA36E35C8450CD8">
way that the Indians some times use when they practice murthers, also, his head was extreamly swollen, and his Body was wounded in several parts of it, and when it was first taken out of the pond, no water issued out of it, which argued that the Body was not drowned, but dead be|fore it came into the water.</P>
<P>Moreover, when <HI>Tobias</HI> (the suspected Murtherer) came near the dead body, it fell a bleeding on fresh as if it had been newly slain albeit it was buried a considerable time before that.</P>
<P>Afterward an Indian called <HI>Patuckson,</HI> came and testified to their fa|ces that he saw <HI>Tobias</HI> and the other Indians murthering <HI>Sausaman:</HI> He also himself before his death had declared, that he was afraid those very Indians would at last prove his Murtherers.</P>
<P>They were therefore apprehended &amp; kept in Dura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce untill Plymouth Court, which was held in June, 1675. and being found guilty of <HI>Sau|saman</HI>'s Death, they were (one of them before his execution confessing the murther) condemned and executed. And then did <HI>philip,</HI> being (as was verily supposed) privy to what <HI>Tobias</HI> (his Counsellor) and those with him had perpetrated upon <HI>John Sausaman,</HI> fall to open Rebellion and bloodshedding amongst the English at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> who were his next Neighbours.</P>
<P>But of the special Occurrences attending the late (and not yet ended) <HI>War</HI> between the English and the Indians, I have elsewhere given a brief account, and therefore shall not here add anything, that not compor|ting with my present design.</P>
<P>The Particulars which have been mentioned, are the chief (if not the only) Troubles which have hapned by the Indians in <HI>New-England,</HI> from the first planting thereof by the English till the late Commoti|ons. Some few private Murthers there have been, which are not insi|sted on in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> as namely those at <HI>Nantucket,</HI> and that by <HI>Matoonas</HI> his Son; and that at <HI>Woburn,</HI> but the publick peace was not so endangered by those clandestine Revenges, as by the Conspiracyes, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elation</HI> whereof hath been described.</P>
<P>It is easy to observe; from the <HI>History</HI> of these <HI>Troubles,</HI> that whereas there have been two sorts of men designing settlement in this part of <HI>America,</HI> some that came hither on the account of Trade, and world|ly Interests, by whom the Indians have been scandalized, others that came hither on a Religious and conscientious account, having in their Eye, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the <HI>Heathen</HI> unto Christ; the former have
<PB N="76" REF="000238_0081_0FA36E3688FD5C70">
been attended with blasting ruining providences, these latter have been signally owned by the Lord Jesus; for the like hath been rarely known in the world, that a plantation should be raised out of nothing, and brought to such considerableness in so short a time, whereas in the close of the last <HI>Century,</HI> there was not so much as one Christian in this Land, there are now above <HI>Fourscore</HI> English, and <HI>Six</HI> Indian <HI>Churches</HI> therein, besides many other Congregations calling upon the Name of the True God in Jesus Christ, although as yet not brought into Church estate, according to the order of the Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An HISTORICAL DISCOURSE Concerning the Prevalency of PRAYER</HEAD>
<P>IT was a great word (and if rightly understood, a true word) which <HI>Luther</HI> spake, when he said, <HI>Est quaeaam precum Omnipotentia,</HI> there is a kind of Omnipotency in Prayer; And the reason is obvious, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> In that the Al|mighty doth suffer himself to be prevailed upon and o|vercome by prayer. Had not Jacob in this respect power with God? yea when he made his supplication, he had power, and prevailed over the Angel, even that Angel who is the Lord of Hosts, the Lord is his memorial. Where do we find in all the Book of God a more wonderfull expression, then that of the Lord to praying Moses, <HI>Now let me alone?</HI> That ever the eternal God should become thus a petitioner to a poor mortal man! <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr</HI> Hall, <HI>Psal.</HI> 82 <HI>p.</HI> 183 184.</NOTE> <HI>Feriendi licentiam petit a Mose qui fecit Mosen.</HI> Prayer then is like the sword of Saul, or the bow of Jonathan, which never re|turned empty from the battle. Prayer is stronger then iron gates. At the prayers of the Church the Iron gates fly open, and the A|postles fetters fall off. Sometimes the prayers of one man that hath an eminent interest in God, are a means to preserve a whole town, yea a whole land from destruction; wel might the An|tient say, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrysostom.</NOTE> <HI>Homine probo orante nihil potentius.</HI> How far did Abra|hams prayers prevail for Sodom? Did not Elijah's prayers open and shut the windows of Heaven? Did they not bring down show|ers when the gasping earth was ready to dy for thirst? When a
<PB N="2" REF="000238_0086_0FA36E3A489E1DA0">
fiery drought had like to have devoured the land of Israel, and the Prophet Amos prayed and cried to the Lord, saying, <HI>O Lord God, Cease I beseech thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small; the Lord repented f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r this, and said this shall not be.</HI></P>
<P>Wars, when justly undertaken, have been successfull through the prevalency of prayer. Moses in the mount praying, is too strong for all the Armies in the valley fighting. When the Phili|stines went up against the Children of Israel, <HI>Samuel</HI> ceased not to cry to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord thundred with a great thunder that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them, that they were smitten before Israel. <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> when surrounded by a multitude of heathen enemyes, by prayer overcame them, When <HI>Z</HI>erah the Ethiopian, came against the Lords people with an host of a thousand thousand men, <HI>Asa</HI> by prayer and faith over came them all. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Isaiah</HI> by their prayers brought an Angel down from heaven, who slew an hundred and fourescore and five thousand Assyrians, in the host of Sennacherib, in one night.</P>

<P>But what need we go far to find examples confirming the truth of this assertion, that <HI>Prayer is of wonderfull Prevalency&punc;</HI> since our own eyes have seen it? <HI>New-England</HI> may now say, if the Lord (even the Prayer-hearing God) had not been on our side when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up; then the proud waters had gone over our Soul. And thus hath it been more then once or twice, especially since the late insurrection and Rebellion of the Heathen Nations round about us. We cannot but acknowledge, and Posterity must know, that we were in ap|pearance a gone and ruined People, and had been so ere this day, if the Lord had not been a God that heareth Prayer.</P>
<P>And there are especially <HI>two Considerations that doe evince, that New-Englands Deliverance from the rage of the Heathen is an eminent answer of Prayer,</HI> 1. In that God hath graciously answered us as to the very Petitions that have bin mostly insisted on, as will appear to admiration by instancing in some Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>How often have we prayed that the Lord would divide infatuate &amp; frustrate the Counsils of the Heathen that sought our ruine,</HI> As sometimes David when pursued by Absolom prayed saying, <HI>O Lord divide their tongues.</HI> Psal. 55. 9. Again David said, <HI>O Lord I pray thee turn the Counsell of Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itophel into fool|ishness.</HI> 2. Sam. 15. 31. Those requests of David were heard, and therefore Absaloms Counsellours were divided, one giving this, and another that advice; and the subtle Counsell of Achi|tophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> (which had it been hearkned unto, David and those with
<PB N="5" REF="000238_0089_0FA36E3C87AAF3A0">
him had perished) must not be followed. In like manner hath the Lord done for us; we have heard how that after the Fort fight, Decemb. 19. 1675. some of the Indian Counsellors advised that they might pursue our Army when upon their retreat, which if they had so done, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would the Consequence have proved. But therefore God divided their Counsells, that others were of another mind.</P>
<P>Moreover, we have received informations, concerning a great Consultation amongst the Indians, soon after their mischief done at <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bury</HI> in April. 1676. Had they then continued to molest the English, our case had been sad; but they supposed they had time e|nough before them, and therefore resolved to be quiet a moneth or two, in order to attendance upon their own planting and fishing.</P>
<P>We have also heard that the old cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty Serpents amongst the In|dians advised that they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all encounters with the English Forces, and rather disperse themselves into small Partyes, and so fall upon the English Towns, burning their houses, destroying their cattle &amp;c. but that the young men thought it best to cut off our souldiers, and then they supposed they might do what they pleased with our towns. Thus were their tongues divided, and Counsils turned into foolishness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How often have we prayed that God would do for us as in the day of Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">an, by causing the heathen to destroy one another, and that the Egyptians might be set against the Egyptians.</HI> The Lord hath answer|ed that Request also. For the Indians have been wasting and killing one another, yea not only such Indians as do pretend friendship to the English, (e.g. the <HI>Natick &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Indians, and the <HI>Mo|hawks</HI> and the <HI>Moheags</HI> under <HI>Uncas;</HI> albeit it is too evident that he was secretly conspiring with <HI>Philip</HI> in his designed mischief, a lit|tle before the War brake forth, but God turned him about, and made him a friend to the English, and an enemy to <HI>Philip</HI>) but also some of those that were once in hostility against us, did at last help to destroy their own nation, friends and kindred, that so they might do service for us. So have they that sought to destroy us, gone into the lower parts of the earth, they are fallen by the sword.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>How often have we prayed that the Lord would take those his Enemies into his own avenging hand,</HI> pleading that though we know not how to come at them, they had such advantages in respect of woods and swamps and dark corners of the earth, to lurk in; yet the hand of our God could reach them, and that therefore he
<PB N="6" REF="000238_0090_0FA36E3D47FF3DC0">
would scatter them by his power and bring them down&punc; and let them wander up and down for meat, and send the destroying Angel a|mongst them. This Prayer hath been heard&punc; For it is known that the Indians were distressed with famine multitudes of them perish|ing for want of breadpunc; &amp; the Lord sent sicknesses amongst them, that Travellers have seen many dead Indians up and down in the woods that were by famine or sickness brought unto that untimely end. Yea the Indians themselves have testified, that more amongst them have been cut off by the sword of the Lord in those respects, then by the sword of the English.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>How often have we prayed that the Lord would remember the Cruelty, Treachery, and above all the Blasphemy of these Heathen?</HI> This Prayer hath been heard in heaven. As for their cruelty, God hath remembered that many of them falling into the hands of the <HI>Mohawks</HI> or other Indians, who fought in our quarrel, used their e|nemies, after their own kind&punc; And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hath been observed, that venge|ance from the Lord did pursue them presently upon the perpetra|tion of some horrid acts of barbarous cruelty toward such as fell into their murderous hands. And as for their Teeachery, God hath retalliated that upon them; as for the perfidious <HI>Narragansets, Peter</HI> Indian was false and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idious to them, upon a disgust recei|ved amongst them, and directed our Army where to find them. Treacherous <HI>Philip,</HI> one of his own men ran away from&punc; him, &amp; told Capt.<HI>Church</HI> where that Grand enemy had hid himself, the issue of which was, another Indian shot a bullet into the treacherous heart of that Covenant-breaking In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idel. Yea many of those bloudy and deceitfull Indians who were taken by Capt.<HI>Church&punc;</HI> would frequent|ly destroy and betray their bloudy and falshearted Comrades. <HI>Ma|toonas</HI> who was the first Indian that treacherously shed innocent En|glish blood in <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony, he some years before preten|ded to something of Religion, being a professor in general (though never baptised, nor of the inchurched Indians) that so he might the more covertly manage the hellish design of revenge that was har|boured in his divelish heart; but at last Sagamore <HI>John</HI> with some of his Indians unexpectedly surprized him, and delivered him to Ju|stice. That abominable Indian <HI>Peter Jethro</HI> betrayed his own fa|ther, and other Indians of his special acquaintance, unto death. Ma|ny of the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Indians, who were wont to lay snares for others, were at last themselves taken by a Stratagem, and brought to deser|ved execution.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000238_0091_0FA36E3E089D9CB8">
And as for their Blasphemy, God hath remembred it, the most no|torious Blasphemers amongst them have been made examples of di|vine revenging Justice, <HI>Quanonthet, Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, Monoce,</HI> all of them cursed Blasphemers; the vengeance of heaven hath not suffered them to live. It is also reported that an English-man, belonging to one of the western Plantations, being mortally wounded by an Indian, the Indian upbraided him with his prayers, saying to him, <HI>You were wont to pray to Jesus Christ, now pray to him, He cannot help you,</HI> and with all added a most hideous Blasphemy. (not fit to be named) a|gainst our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, immediately upon which a bul|let took him in the head, and dashed out his brains, sending his cur|sed soul in a moment amongst the Devils, and Blasphemers in Hell for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>How often have we prayed that the Lord would take away spi|rit and courage from those that have been in hostility against us, and cause those haters of the Lord to submit themselves.</HI> In this thing also the Lord hath had respect to our requests. For hundreds of Indians the last summer came &amp; surrendered themselves to the English, e.g. in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony the <HI>Squa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">chim</HI> of <HI>Saconet,</HI> with above an hundred Indians submitted themselves to mercy, June, 30, 1676. Not long after that two hundred Indians more surrendred them|selves. And in the eastern parts of this Colony, (July. 6. there were six Sachims addressed themselves to the English in order to the obtaining peace, bringing in with them three hundred men besides women and Children. Likewise in the same moneth <HI>Sagamore John</HI> submitted himself with about an hundred &amp; eighty Indians; and hundreds of them came &amp; submitted themselves to the English in <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony. These things came not to pass without the finger of God, so manifest as that the enemy himself could not but take notice of it. For a stout Indian Captain who was afterward executed at <HI>Boston,</HI> professed to some of our Souldiers, that they could never have subdued the Indians, <HI>But</HI> (said he striking up|on his breast) <HI>Englishmans God maketh us afraid here.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>How often have we prayed that God would in special look after those places, which were in most eminent danger, as being above others exposed to the fury of the enemy?</HI> And we have had the petitions we desired of him in that respect. What a black appearance of death and ruine was before the poor people at <HI>Quaboag,</HI> when they were all cooped up in one unfortified house, and surrounded by a barba|rous multitude of cruel Indians, who thirsted after their blood? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="8" REF="000238_0092_0FA36E3EC844E5C8">
God by a strange providence, sent Major <HI>Willard,</HI> who with a smal party of souldiers, came a few hours or minutes before it was too late, by which means the remaining Inhabitants of that place had their lives given them for a prey. After that, the western plantati|ons, <HI>North Hampton, Hadly, Hatf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ld</HI> &amp;c. were in the eminentest danger, by reason of the enemy taking up their Rendezvouze in those parts; but God preserved and delivered them, in answer un|to prayer. That memorable providence ought not to be forgotten, how that in the beginning of March, 1676. Our Army missed their way (designing to surprize the Indians about <HI>Wachuset</HI> Hills) and were providentially led to North Hampton; Also Major <HI>Treat</HI> with souldiers under his Command, did then take up his Quarters in that town, coming thither a day sooner then was intended; The next day a great body of Indians brake in upon the town, and in probability had laid it wast, had there not been such a supply of souldiers as hath been mentioned, which the good providence of God brought thither, in answer to the prayers of his people. Moreover, the whole Colony of <HI>Plymouth</HI> was in most apparent danger of being overrun and overwhelmed with the enemy; especially in the spring of the year 1676. when (as we have been informed) the Indians were designing, with fifteen hundred men to fall upon all the scat|tered towns throughout that Jurisdiction. But God gave men, yea a great <HI>Sachim,</HI> for the life of his dear people in that Colony. We have heard that <HI>Quanonch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> surprizal and death, struck an amaze|ment into the heathen, and diverted their purposed mischief. May 8. 1676. when <HI>Bridgwater</HI> was assaulted. and in danger of being laid wast, God sent thunder and rain from heaven, which caused the Indians to turn back. And when they attempted to make <HI>Taun|ton</HI> a desolation, July 11. how wonderfully did the Lord save <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> town? so ordering by his providence, as that a captive <HI>Negro</HI> es|caping from the Indians, informed of their purpose to fall upon that place, whereupon the Inhabitants stood upon their guard, and soul|diers were timously sent in to them for their relief and defence.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>How often have we prayed for our poor Captives, that God would preserve them and return them?</HI> When some of ours not many years since, were in Captivity under <HI>Mahomet,</HI> what prayer was made for them continually? Especially it was so in respect of Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> and his son, the Church in <HI>Charlstown</HI> setting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> day apart to seek unto the Lord by fasting and prayer, that the persons men|tioned might be set at liberty, and although at that time there was
<PB N="9" REF="000238_0093_0FA36E3F8832FFC0">
no likelyhood that ever it should be, the infidel King, under whose power they were, not being willing to accept of money for their re|demption, yet God brought it about wonderfully, and rather then his people prayers should not be answered, that Tyrant must dy by a strange and unexpected providence. But I speak now concerning those that have been Captives amongst the heathen in this land. And God hath heard us for them. Whereas upon the 9th of May, 1676. the Magistrates, and Ministers of this Colony, and the De|putyes of the General Court, sought the Lord together by fasting and prayer, and did in special manner beg that Captives might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e returned, as a token for good, and pledge of further answers of prayer; within a few weeks after this, neer upon twenty of our Captives were set at liberty. For some, prayer hath been more a|bundantly poured forth; so for Mr. <HI>Rowlandson</HI> his wife and two children, and we have seen the Lord returning them all again. And whereas in October 1676. Amongst others, the son of that man of God, and man of prayer, Reverend Mr. <HI>Cobbet</HI> (the faithfull Pastor of the Church in Ipswich) was surprized in a vessel by the Northern Indians, and led away into Captivity; doubtless God did it, that so glory might be to his holy name, and that the world might see how prayer can prevail with him. Mr.<HI>Cobbet</HI> no soon|er heard what was befallen his son, but he called together about thirty of his Christian neighbours (that being as many as could on the sudden convene) and they set some time apart to pray for him that was now a Captive, after this his Fathers heart was sweetly quieted, believing that God had heard them: Some others also that attended that Service, were as confidently perswaded that God would return (and that in comfortable plight) Mr.<HI>Cobbets</HI> son to him again, as if he were already come; Prayer also was made in pub|lick Congregations in particular for that young man; and in De|cember following, those prayers were fully answered, the Lord bringing it about in strange wayes, the particulars and circumstan|ces whereof are too large here to be insisted on.</P>
<P>Let me further take notice here, that whereas no longer then three weeks since, (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> July 25. 1677.) the Church in <HI>Salem</HI> set a day apart to seek the Lord in special on behalf of those belong|ing to that Town lately fallen&punc; into the hands of the Indians; whilst they were praying, God brought home one of the vessels that the Indians had surprised, &amp; two persons (who were Masters of Vessels) that had been particularly prayed for in the morning, returned
<PB N="10" REF="000238_0094_0FA36E404794BC20">
solemn thanks to God in the after part of the day, in that he had in answer of the Prayers of his people, brought them out of their Cap|tivity.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>How often have we prayed that God would cutt off the Ring|leaders, and principal blondy promoters of the late troubles?</HI> That the Lord would doe unto them as unto Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook of Kison (which perished at Endor, they became as dung&punc; for the earth) and make their Nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, yea all their Princes like Zeba and Zalmunna.</P>
<P>New in these Cryes to heaven our God hath heard us even to admiration&punc; <HI>Philip</HI> the Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd enemy and beginner of the War, is gone to his own place. It was observed that a little before the destruction of that bloudy Foe, the Lord stirred up the hearts of some of his Servants, to be instant in prayer against that enemy in particular, yea and caused them firmly to believe that it should be so. Nor could they cease crying to the Lord against him, untill they had prayed the bullet into <HI>Philips</HI> heart. And concerning what prayers have been in closets about that thing, we shall hear more at the day of judgment when the Lord Jesus will reveal it and reward it openly. Are not all the Chieftains amongst the Heathen who have been in Hostility against us cutt off for ever? and their memorial is perished with them. <HI>O thou most High, Though hast rebuked the Heathen, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever!</HI></P>
<P>We have heard of two and twenty Indian Captains, slain all of them, and brought down to Hell in one day, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Decemb. 19. 1675. And some of the Indians have confessed that at the Fall|fight, May 18. 1676. they lost no less then three and thirty of their Counsellours, which put them into an absolute Confusion. that they were like men amazed ever after.</P>
<P>Where are the six <HI>Narraganset</HI> Sachims, with all their Captains and Counsellors? Where are the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Sachims, with all their Captains and Counsellours? Where is <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Squaw-Sachim</HI> of <HI>Pocass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> with all their Captains and Counsellours? God doe so to all the implacable enemies of Christ and of his People in New-England!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If we consider the TIME when God hath appeared for us, it It is manifest that our Salvation is an Answer of Prayer.</HI> It was a fatal happy blow which the Indians received at the Fort-Fight in the <HI>Narraganset Country;</HI> &amp; a little before that, all these Churches
<PB N="11" REF="000238_0095_0FA36E410845A918">
were solemnly by Fasting and prayer seeking to the Lord, that the Heathen might be rebuked at that time. When <HI>Quanonchet</HI> was taken and slain, it was an amazing stroke to the enemy. And but a few dayes before that, many Churches in <HI>England</HI> kept a day of Fasting and prayer for poor <HI>New-England.</HI> In the latter end of June. 1676. (and ever after that) successes against the enemy were wonderfull; especially in Plymouth Colony. Now on the 22. of June, all the Churches in that Colony set apart a day of solemn Hu|miliation, and renewed their Covenant. And on the 29. of that moneth, was a day of Thanks-giving throughout this Colony, the prayers &amp; praises of which day were signally owned by the Lord, who did then set ambushments against the enemy &amp; they were smitten. Also in this very Moneth, the Churches in <HI>Dublin</HI> in Ire|land were solemnly seeking to the Lord on our behalf. Why should not these things be written &amp; recorded for the Generation to come? why should they not be made known to our Children, that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his Commandments.</P>
<P>Some one perhaps will say, did not God in the time of your late War seem to be angry with your Prayers? Had you not the saddest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idings on your solemn dayes of Humiliation?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is true, and the thoughts of it should for ever hum|ble us; yet we know, sometimes the Lord seems to be displeased with the Prayers of his people only to try their Faith (as with the wo|man of Canaan) when as indeed they are his delight. Moreover (alas!) it cannot be denied or doubted of, but that the Lord saw formality and hypocrisy in the prayers of many amongst us, which he was offended at; howbeit there are some living Christians, that walk closely with God;a few Names that have not defiled their gar|ments with the sins, and generally prevailing temptations of these times; unto them and to their Prayers hath the Lord had respect. It must also be confessed, that the prayers of the Churches in <HI>Europe</HI> have had no small influence into our mercyes. I can assure the Reader, that the Churches in <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI> in <HI>Dorset,</HI> in <HI>Devon</HI> in <HI>Somer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et,</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> have by Fasting and Prayer, sought the Lord for New-England, in the time of our late troubles. And I doubt not but that the Lords praying people in other Countyes, where I have no acquaintance or correspondence, have done the like. We are infinitely indebted to that God, who having a pur|pose to glorify himself by hearing prayers, put into their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> be earnest with the Lord on our behalf.</P>

And that is the special improvement which should be made of what hath been discoursed; since we have seen what prayer can do, <HI>The consideration of these things should stir up an holy resolution in every one, to be sincere, frequent, and constant, in this so great and powerfull a duty.</HI> It is reported of <HI>Joachim</HI> (the father of the Virgin Mary, that <HI>prayer was his meat and drink.</HI> And we know what was Davids profession, Psal. 116. 1, 2. <HI>I love the Lord, be|cause he hath heard my voice, and my supplication, because he hath enclined his ear to me, therefore I will call upon him as long as I shall live.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore to the particulars already mentioned, I shall (for how should a man when writing upon such a subject, easily break off) add a few more. It would indeed fill a volume, should all the Instances this way be produced, which stand upon record in approved Au|thors; nor have I present leisure to revolve many books that touch upon this subject; only such particulars as do presently occur to mind I shall relate, hoping it will not be unprofitable to the reader&punc; who possibly hath not had the knowledge of them, or not of all of them.

<P>There have been, whom prayer hath brought back from the gates of the grave, whenas to all outward appearance, they have been other|wise past recovery; not to insist upon Scriptural examples here neither; It is a memorable passage which a great Historian hath noted con|cerning that Learned and Religious, Sr. <HI>John Cheek,</HI> who was Tu|tor to our English Josiah, King Edward 6th.</P>
<P>Sr. John being sick nigh unto death, the King did carefully en|quire after his welfare every day; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fullers <HI>History of the Church p.</HI> 424.</NOTE> at last the Physitians told him, that there was no hopes of life; Nay (said the King) he will not dye at this time, for I have this morning begged his life of God in my prayers, and obteined it; which accordingly came to passe; and soon after Sr. John wonderfully recovered beyond all expecta|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Melancthon</HI> was taken desperately sick at <HI>Vinaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Melchior <HI>A</HI>dam <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cthonis</HI></NOTE> as he was in a jour|ney towards <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> in order to a Conference with some of the reformed Divines in Germany about matters of religion; <HI>Luther</HI> hea|ring of it, hastned to visit him, and with tears saying, Alas! how

precious and profitable an Instrument of the Church, is miserably weakned, and ready to perish! and falling upon his knees, he did most earnestly wrestle with the Lord for his recovery, and prevai|led, so as that <HI>Melancthon</HI> would afterwards confess, that if it had not been for <HI>Luthers</HI> prayers, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem in vita</HI> Myconii</NOTE> he had died by that sickness.</P>
<P>At another time, <HI>Myconius</HI> being fallen into a deep consumption, <HI>Luther</HI> was earnest in prayer to God for his recovery; and he wrote a letter to him, wherein he thus expresseth himself, <Q>I pray Christ our Lord, our salvation, our health, that I may not live to see thee, and some others of our Colleagues to dye, and go to heaven, and to leave me here amongst the Divels alone. Farewel and God forbid that I should hear of thy death whilst I live, <HI>sed te super|stitem faciat mihi Deus, hoc peto et volo, et fiat voluntas mea, Amen! quia hac voluntas gloriam nominis Dei, certe non meam voluptatem. nec copiam quarit.</HI></Q> A while after <HI>Myconius</HI> recovered, and outli|ved <HI>Luther,</HI> ever acknowledging that he was beholding to God for putting it into the heart of <HI>Luther;</HI> so to pray for him, and instru|mentally to lengthen out his life seven years beyond his own, and friends expectation.</P>
<P>Yea more, Divels and powers of darkness have fallen before the power of prayer. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem in vita Luther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE> A desperate young man in <HI>Germany,</HI> who in an hellish pang of temptation had sold himself to, and made an expli|cit covenant with the Divel; having revealed his miserable codition to <HI>Luther,</HI> he called the Church together, and the young man be|ing with them, they fasted and prayed, so that the Divel threw the writing, which he had received of the young man, in at the win|dow, and a forlorn soul was rescued out of the hands of that devou|ring Lion. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fertur in vi|ta Angustini</HI></NOTE> How often have poor creatures under bodily possessions been delivered from that thraldome by earnest prayer? <HI>Austin</HI> by his prayers cast out Divels.

<PB N="14" REF="000238_0098_0FA36E434994BE58">
Poets. Among others that came to pray with this poor miserable man, Mr. <HI>Rothwel</HI> (a minister that was famous in those parts in those dayes) was one. As he was coming, the Divel told them in the house with the possessed man, yonder is <HI>Rothwel</HI> a coming; and upon his entring into the house, raged and blasphemed, saying also wilt thou go to prayer, I'le make such a noise as shall distract thee, and dost thou think that God will hear distracted prayers? Mr. <HI>Rothwel</HI> replyed, God heareth the prayers of the upright, and hath promised to give his spirit to help infirmityes in prayer; there|fore in Confidence of his promise, &amp; powerful assistance of his spirit, and in the name of his son Jesus Christ, we will go to prayer. So he did. The Divel for above a quarter of an hour made an horrid noise, and roared at Mr. <HI>Rothwell'</HI>s face, but at last was forced to be silent, and departed out of the man, who before the Prayer was end|ed, did to the amazement and joy of all the Auditors present say Amen to the Petitions that were presented before the Lord on his behalf. After Mr. Rothwel left him, he was striken dumb for three years together; at length by prayer also, God opened his mouth, and restored his speech to him; One using this Petition, Lord open his mouth, and his lips shall shew forth thy praise; he answered in the Congregation, <HI>Amen,</HI> and so continued to speak, and spake graciously to his dying day.</P>
<P>I remember I have met with another example not unlike unto this but now mentioned. In the town of <HI>Barwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> there was a man (Steward to the Lord of <HI>Granson</HI>) reputed Godly, who was very much afflicted in his mind. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Set Mr.</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">om <HI>his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Clark.</NOTE> Mr.<HI>Balsom</HI> (an eminent preach|er, by whose Ministry in that one town, sixty persons were (as was judged) savingly wrought upon) did several times visit him, and sought to apply words of comfort to him, but nothing of that nature taking place, he whispered the Steward in the ear to this purpose, <HI>I doubt there is something within which you would doe well to discover;</HI> whereupon, immediately the mans tongue swelled out of his mouth that he was not able to speak, and to the astonishment of those in the room, a shrill voice was heard, as it were speaking out of his thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at, saying, what dost thou talking to him of free grace and promises? he is mine. Mr. <HI>Balsom</HI> perceiving that it was the De|vil that spake, told him, he did not know that men were his as long as they were alive in this world. To whom the Devil re|plyed, If God would let me loose, I would find enough in the best of you all to make you mine, and as for this man he hath given him|self
<PB N="15" REF="000238_0099_0FA36E44088E8D40">
to me. I will not (said Mr. <HI>Balsom</HI>) believe the father of lyes; but I will goe home and pray for this poor man, and get all the force in the town I can to joyn with me, and I doe believe that thou Satan shalt loose thy hold before tomorrow morning. Mr. <HI>Bal|som</HI> upon his return home that night, found diverse Christians in his house, who waited to speak with him, unto whom he decla|red that he could not but admiringly take notice of the providence of God in bringing them to his house, whom otherwise he had pur|posed to send for; and desired them to spend part of the night with him, in seeking to the Lord in the behalf of such a distressed posses|sed man: which they did, and the next morning Satan had lost his possession: and when Mr. <HI>Balsom</HI> enquired of the poor man how it was with him, He answered; through the goodness of God, I have overcome, and am now as full of Comfort, as before I was full of Trouble.</P>
<P>I have also heard a worthy Divine in <HI>Dublin,</HI> speak of a man, that being under bodily possession by an evil spirit, a Company of praying Christians met together, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE> to seek the Lord on his behalf; a|mongst them there was a precious holy woman, who kneeled behind the door in the room where they were praying together, and there were strong actings of Faith in her soul; at last the Devil was forced to depart; only as he was going out of the possessed party, he cryed out, <HI>O the Woman, the Woman behind the door!</HI></P>
<P>Some very learned and judicious Writers conceive, that <HI>Epil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p|tick</HI> and <HI>Lunatick</HI> persons are those <HI>Demoniacks</HI> whom we read so much of in the New-Testament. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Medes <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> 6.</NOTE> There is a <HI>Deliration</HI> that pro|ceeds <HI>ex vi morbi,</HI> being from or with a Fever, and another kind of deliration which is <HI>fine Febre,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">za <HI>in Mat.</HI> 8. 16. <HI>&amp;</HI> 17. 15.</NOTE> when a man having no other disease is crazed or distracted. Not they that are subjected to the former, but to this latter have been accounted <GAP DESC="foreign"> possessed persons. The Jews of old had such an opinion concerning mad men. Joh. 10. 20. Consider also, Math. 17. 14, 15,&mdash;18. with Luk. 9. 39. Whatever of solidity may be in that notion, is not a place here to dispute; but this is certain, that distracted persons have been restored to the use of their understanding again by Fasting and Prayer. That Moses of his time, Mr. <HI>Dod</HI> (concerning whom Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> giveth this Testimony, that he was the meekest man upon the face of the earth) had a godly son, whom it pleased the Most High to leave unto sore distraction in his mind, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Burroughs <HI>on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> 11 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2<HI>d. part. p.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">8.</NOTE> whereupon Mr. Dod called some of his god|ly praying Friends together, who set a day apart solemnly to seek
<PB N="16" REF="000238_0100_0FA36E44C9592488">
the Lord about that matter, and whilst they were yet speaking in prayer, God heard them, so as that the distracted person was not only restored to his right mind again, but did himself conclude that day of prayer with solemn Thanks giving unto God. This Infor|mation I received from a Reverend Minister, who was present in Mr Dods house, when that day of fasting and prayer was there obser|ved, upon the occasion mentioned.</P>
<P>It is reported concerning that excellent man, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>see Mr Levist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of fulfilling the Scriptures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 431</NOTE> and famous Minister in <HI>Edenbourgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bruce</HI> (concerning whom the Learned <HI>Didocla|vius</HI> hath given a most honourable testimony) that diverse persons that were distracted, and some who were Epileptical, past hopes of recovery, were nevertheless restored to perfect health in answer to Mr. <HI>Bruces</HI> prayers.</P>
<P>But I have not met with any instance to this purpose more affecting then that which is (by an Author worthy of credit) published con|cerning Mr. <HI>Patrick Simpson</HI> a learned and very holy Minister, som|times of <HI>Sterling</HI> in Scotland. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lfilling of the Scriptures p</HI> 437</NOTE> The story in brief is this.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Simpsons</HI> wife (a gracious woman) falling sick, was sorely as|saulted by Satan, who told her that she should be given over into his hand; The temptation and affrightment prevailed so far as to re|solve in a visible distraction, that the good woman, most unlike her former way whilst she was her self, would break forth sometimes with dreadfull and horrid expressions; This was (and could not be otherwise) a most bitter affliction to her precious husband, who told those about her, that he was assured, that Satans mali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e should at last receive a shameful foyle; wherefore he retired himself into his garden, and shutting the door, betook&punc; himself to fasting and prayer. One <HI>Helen Garner</HI> (a godly woman) being sollicitous for Mr. <HI>Simpson,</HI> as fearing that his labours, grief, fasting might be too hard for him, used some means to get over into the garden, where Mr. <HI>Simpson</HI> was alone wrestling with God; being come neer the place where he was, she was terrified with an extraordinary noise which caused her to fall upon the ground; It was like the noise of a great rushing of multitudes together, and therewithal such a melo|dious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound as did make her know it was something more then hu|mane; so that she fel to prayer, entreating the Lord to pardon her rashness in so coming thither, considering it was respect to his ser|vant, who had been an Instrument of good to her soul, that did in|duce her. After going forward, she found Mr. <HI>Simpson</HI> lying up|on the ground; nor would he reveal what he had met with, until
<PB N="17" REF="000238_0101_0FA36E45DE62CB18">
promise was made not to speak of it whilst he was alive in this world. Upon this he said, <HI>O what am I being dust and ashes, that the holy Ministring spirits should be sent by the Lord to deliver a message to me,</HI> and shewed that Angels from heaven had by an audible voice given him answer concerning that which he had been praying a|bout. [This was a thing extraordinary, and in no wise to be expect|ed by Christians ordinarily] and returning into his house, he bid those that were in the room with his wife, be of good comfort; for he was assured that within ten hours she should be delivered from that distraction. After this he went to prayer by the bed side, and as he was in prayer mentioning Jacobs wrestling with God, his wife sate up in the bed, and casting aside the curtain said, <HI>Thou art this day Jacob, thou hast wrestled, and hast prevailed, and now God hath made good his word which he spake to you this morning, for I am pluck|ed out of the hands of Satan, and he shall no more have power over me.</HI> This interruption made him silent for a while, but after in great mel|tings of heart he proceeded in prayer, magnifiing the riches of di|vine grace and love, and from that hour his wife continued to dis|course christianly and comfortably even to her dying hour.</P>
<P>And as for those spiritual (which are worse then bodily possessi|ons) that Satan holds in the Souls of men, how often hath prayer been a means to out him, and cause him (full sore against his will) to quit his strong hold for ever. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clark, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u|pra.</HI></NOTE> Prayer hath (i.e. instrumentally) converted many a Soul, <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> was wont to pray much for the conversion of <HI>Bernard Gilpin,</HI> and the Lord answered his prayers, and that <HI>Gilpin</HI> proved an eminent instrument of Gods Glory, and of good unto his Church.</P>
<P>I have read of one who having a Brother that spent his time in Hawking, drinking and other profane vanityes, upon a saturday, when his ungodly Brother was gone upon an hawking match; he set that very day apart by Fasting and prayer to beg of God, that his Brother might be converted. And the Lord answered his pray|ers wonderfully; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> White <HI>his Relation.</HI></NOTE> For within a week after his brother was strangely changed, and did himself (instead of spending his time in hawking and drinking) observe many dayes of secret humiliation between the Lord and his own soul, on the account of the sins he had been guilty of, in the days of vanity, &amp; made a very godly end at last.</P>
<P>That precious and famous Minister of Christ, Mr.<HI>Welch,</HI> being in a journey, his entertainment came to more then he expected, so that the next morning he had not wherewith to pay for his horse meat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Hostler sware and railed exceedingly for his money: Mr.<HI>Welch</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="000238_0102_0FA36E466A0F0F30">
shut his chamber door and went to prayer, and the hostler standing at the door over heard him, and was converted by that prayer; ever after that time highly respecting Mr. <HI>Welch,</HI> and refusing to accept of any thing for his entertainment, either then or at any o|ther times afterwards, when occasion was offered.</P>
<P>I knew one, the son of an holy, and eminently faithfull Minister, who in some of the dayes of his youth had been wild and vain, but was (through the Grace of Christ) converted in his young years, and after his Fathers death, perusing his private papers, he per|ceived, that not many dayes before he was in the pangs of the new birth, his Father had been by secret Fasting and prayer seeking un|to the Lord that converting sanctif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Grace might be bestowed upon that son of his.</P>
<P>That notable Israelite, Mr. <HI>Hugh Kennedy,</HI> Provost of Air in Scot|land, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lib. supra <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. p.</HI> 411 412.</NOTE> one day being long alone in prayer, while some of his intimate friends stayed a great while to speak with him, upon their enquiry into the reason why he made them wait so long; he told them it was no wonder, <HI>for</HI> (said he) <HI>I have this day obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ined mercy for me, and all mine.</HI> And so indeed it came to pass; for not so much as one of his children, but evident signes of conversion and true godliness were observed in them. This was that <HI>Kennedy,</HI> who when he was a dying could say, <HI>If the wals of this house could speak, they could tell how many sweet dayes I have had in secret fellowship with God, and how familiar he hath been with my soul.</HI> This is he, concerning whom Mr. <HI>Welch</HI> once said, <Q>Happy is that City, yea happy is that nation that hath an <HI>Hugh Kenne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> in it; I may self have certainly found the answers of his prayers to the Lord on my behalf.</Q> There is one pas|sage recorded concerning him which is exceeding strange. It is this.</P>
<P>One of his sons being absent at sea, On a certain night he rose early, before break of day, and came to his familiar friend <HI>John Steward,</HI> and desired him to rise, and go with him into a room to pray, for (said he) my son with the rest of our Christian friends now at sea, are at the very nick of perishing. After he had spent some time in pouring out his soul before the Lord, he rose up cheerfully, saying, <HI>now are they safe.</HI> John Steward being amazed thereat, writ this down, with the day and hour, and at the return of the ship made enquiry, and found that in that very hour of that night, they then were in a most dangerous place, so that all hope that they should be saved was taken away, only they were by an extraordinary unex|pected providence then delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000238_0103_0FA36E47078C3870">
To draw to a Conclusion, let the world beware, of doing any wronge to a praying people. Such blasting strokes from God were upon those that set themselves against the reformed Churches and Professors (who were called <HI>Piccardines</HI>) in <HI>Bohemia</HI> of old that it became a proverbial speech, <HI>If any man be weary of his life, let him become an enemy to the Piccaraines.</HI> So I say, <HI>If any man be weary of his life, let him become an enemy to a Praying People,</HI> such as (through grace) many in <HI>New-England</HI> have been, and are to this day. And wo to that man, whoever he be, upon whom the Prayers of <HI>New-England</HI> shall fall, it were better for that man that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he thrown there with into the midst of the Sea. It is said concerning the Witnesses, Rev. 11. 5. <Q>if any man hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies, and if any man will hurt them, he must on this manner be killed.</Q> Is not the spirit of prayer that fire? That Scottish Queen once professed, that she was more afaaid of Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> his prayers, then of an army of ten thousand men.</P>
<P>And it is noted concerning <HI>Leolin</HI> Prince of Wales, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ert Dr. <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ell</HI></NOTE> that being perswaded by some to take up arms against a Prince that was famous for Religion; he replyed that he was afraid of that mans prayers more then of Armyes.</P>
<P>Wherefore I shall finish this Discourse with the solemn expressi|on of one <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr blessed Bro|ther and Prede|cessor in this place, in his Sermons on</HI> 2 <HI>King.</HI> 18. 4. <HI>p.</HI> 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> (whom I have peculiar reason to love) that was well known in this place seven and twenty years agoe. <HI>I had rather</HI> (saith he) <HI>be environed with Armyes of armed men, and compassed round with drawn swords and instruments of death, then that the least praying Saint should bend the edge of his prayers against me; for there is no stan|ding before the prayers of Saints, especially if they unite their forces, and join together in the same requests.</HI> Rise up, <HI>O</HI> Lord and let thine enemyes be scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee be|fore thee.</P>
