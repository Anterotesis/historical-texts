<P>THE Author being desired by several Gentlemen to Communicate the following Piece of <HI>Natural History</HI> to the Publick, He takes the Opportunity to gratify them upon the Repetition of something like it in ENGLAND on the 19th of <HI>March</HI> last: Especially considering that <HI>Our Country</HI> has not yet been duly informed of this rare <HI>Phoe|nomenon,</HI> tho' it was observ'd &amp; admir'd almost all over EUROPE: And tho' Dr. HALLEY in the <HI>Transacti|ons of the Royal Society,</HI> &amp; Mr. WHISTON in a Piece by it self have wrote on the Subject; yet an Account so Particular by any single Eye-Witness has not yet been divulged to the World.</P>
<P>IT lies in His <HI>Journal</HI> in a Letter to his Kinsman in LONDON, who Communicated it to Dr. HALLEY aforesaid the Renowned &amp; Learned <HI>Savilian Pro|fessor</HI> of the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> in the University of OXFORD; Who did Me the Honour to signify that He was so Pleased with the Relation, as He had Thoughts of Printing it Himself with His Remarks on the Subject. I suppose the coming out of Mr. WHISTON'S Account was a reason of Preventing Him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>COMBS, <DATE><HI>Thursday March</HI> 8. 1716.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is to give You an exact Account as possible, of a most amazing <HI>Appearance in the Hea|vens,</HI> which I myself with all the Town of STOW-MARKET, beheld for above Half an Hour together, on the last <HI>Tuesday Night</HI> between 7 and 8 of the Clock.</P>
<P>I WAS then occasionally at the Town aforesaid which is about 2 Miles off the
<PB N="2" REF="002068_0004_0FBB792F830C9808">
House where I live, and in Company with several Ladies discoursing of the pre|sent Face of the Publick Affairs. We had just been Reading in one of the News Papers of <HI>Sea Monsters</HI> lately observ'd in the <HI>Medi|terranean:</HI> &amp; one of the Company told us Her Husband bro't a Report from NORWICH of a wonderful <HI>Sight in the Air</HI> seen over the City 2 or 3 Nights ago. This sort of Con|versation led some of the Elder of them into a Relation of such kind of Appearan|ces They had heard their Parents or other People speak of, as happening in ENGLAND a little before the <HI>Civil War.</HI></P>
<P>IN Opposition to This I very freely in|veighed with some uncommon degree of Warmth &amp; Assurance; Attributing such Things as Those to the fertile Tongues &amp; Inventions of some Romantick People, &amp; the fanciful &amp; fearful Imagination of others. When I was almost rude in Depreciating the Stories &amp; Opinions of the Ladies; a little Girl came running in a Fright to tell us, <HI>There was a Great Sight in the Air.</HI> Upon this observing them to listen with some Concern &amp; Fear, I confess I coud'nt forbare Laughing easily, &amp; telling them in some sort of Triumph; <HI>I Believ'd it was
<PB N="3" REF="002068_0005_0FBB793313855468">
from the Whimsies of such little Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters"> as these that such Reports &amp; Apparitions arose.</HI> However, To oblige the Gentlewomen, I went out, which was about <HI>a Quarter after Seven,</HI> &amp; was forc'd immediately to fall a Sacrifice to what I then at least thought to be their more Orthodox Judgment. <HI>Heaven itself</HI> seem'd to undertake their Argument &amp; to prove it in so surprizing &amp; evident a manner that I dare not any longer resist them. I saw what I cou'd never have ima|gined before, and what I believe is utterly impossible for me to represent exactly to your Imagination.</P>
<P>THERE seemed to be <HI>a great Stream of smoakey Light</HI> rising in the N.E, reaching from near the Earth, ascending &amp; waving like the Light of a great House or <HI>Bon-fire</HI> in a dark Evening about half a Mile off, which we therefore tho't it at first to be: But soon alter'd our minds when we saw it increasing in Breadth Length &amp; Brightness, &amp; pushing forwards, retreating &amp; advan|cing in the shape of a <HI>Broad Sword</HI> &amp; like the shooting Vibrations of a very high Blaze, until it extended to the Point over our Heads. As it increased in Bigness, so did it likewise in the Swiftness &amp; Fury of
<PB N="4" REF="002068_0006_0FBB7934DC2DC690">
its Motion &amp; grew by Degrees into a blewish, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; fiery Colour, almost like to that of the Flame of <HI>Brimstone.</HI> Both the Colour &amp; Figure continually changed I know not how, 'till at length on a sudden it brake forth into the Appearance of a raging &amp; mighty <HI>Torrent</HI> of bloudy Waters, that at first look'd like the sudden giving way of a Damm, &amp; the Sea bearing all irresisti|bly before it: Whereupon all that Part of the <HI>Heavens</HI> over us turned of an inconceiva|bly bright <HI>Rainbow</HI> Colour, &amp; immediately run into an admirable, inexpressible Confusion of an infinite <HI>Variety of Motions</HI> that were amazingly quick and terrible to behold.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how to give you an <HI>Idea</HI> of this part of the Appearance; unless you may conceive something of it by the various &amp; most violent Motions that are in a <HI>great Body of Waters,</HI> when an higher Stream hap|pens to descend and impetuously rush into another. Sometimes they ran into <HI>Circular</HI> Forms, sometimes into <HI>Ovals,</HI> sometimes the <HI>Circles</HI> &amp; <HI>Ovals</HI> were vari|ously compress'd on their sides by their ap|proaching nearer to one another, or the greater <HI>Interflux</HI> of the nameless &amp; un|known
<PB N="5" REF="002068_0007_0FBB793647533A98">
known Matter. Sometimes th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> wind|ing within &amp; hastily pursuing one another in the manner of <HI>Whirlpools,</HI> &amp; sometimes they ran round &amp; cross'd like an 8, &amp; in numberless other different Figures; that something resembl'd the various, quick &amp; confus'd Rambles of <HI>Flies</HI> in the midst of a Room, or of <HI>Spiders</HI> on the surface of a Pond; or the perplexing Contortions &amp; Turnings of a great Heap of <HI>living Eels</HI> just cover'd with Water in the bottom of a Boat; or as the little Foldings &amp; Ridges at the Tops &amp; Bottoms of the <HI>Fingers;</HI> or to mention no more Comparisons, like the Figures it is probable you have seen of CARTESIUS'S <HI>Vortices.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this while, the Brightness, Bloodi|ness &amp; Fieryness of the Colours before-men|tion'd together with the Swiftness of the Motions increased, insomuch as we could hardly trace them with our Eyes; 'till at length almost all the whole <HI>Heavens</HI> ap|pear'd as if they were set <HI>on a Flame,</HI> which wrought &amp; glimmer'd with <HI>Flashes</HI> in a most dreadful &amp; undescribable manner. It seem'd to threaten us with an immediate Descent &amp; <HI>Deluge of Fire,</HI> filled the Streets with loud &amp; doleful Outcries &amp; Lamenta|tions &amp; frighted a great many People into
<PB N="6" REF="002068_0008_0FBB7938FAEEA3B0">
their H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> &amp; we all began to think whither the SON OF GOD was next to make His Glorious &amp; Terrible Appearance, or the <HI>Conflagration</HI> of the World was now begun. For the <HI>Elements</HI> seem'd just as if they were melting with fervent Heat, &amp; the <HI>AEtherial Vault</HI> to be burning over us like the fierce Agitations of the Blaze in a <HI>Fur|nace,</HI> or at the Top of a fiery <HI>Oven:</HI> &amp; the glimmering Light look'd as if it proceeded from a <HI>more Glorious Body behind</HI> that was approaching nearer &amp; about to make its sudden Appearance to our Eyes.</P>
<P>WHILE we expected &amp; wondred what wou'd be the next Alteration &amp; dreaded the Consequence; all on a sudden the flaming Body above us brake into <HI>innume|rable Spears of Light,</HI> that at first darted every way &amp; a-cross one another, but in a little while they conformed to the same Point of Motion &amp; played in a regular &amp; astonishing manner. At first it seem'd as if the very <HI>Frame of the World was a Dissolving:</HI> But afterwards one wou'd have thought that there was a furious <HI>Battle of Invisible Spirits,</HI> that <HI>the Powers &amp; Principalities of the Air</HI> had broke out into a fierce Conten|tion, &amp; that transforming themselves into
<PB N="7" REF="002068_0009_0FBB793A2FF947D0">
<HI>Angels of Light</HI> They were con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters">ted into <HI>Seraphick Flames</HI> &amp; Figures that are said to resemble their Natures.</P>
<P>THESE distinct &amp; various Lights were in the shape of Swords, &amp; their several Bodies did not appear intirely at the same Time, but seem'd to begin at one End &amp; shoot a prodigious way to a sharp Point in a moment, like one continued Blaze of a <HI>flying Fire-Brand.</HI> As they continually appear'd &amp; stream'd, so they continually vanish'd, like the lucid <HI>Path of a Rocket,</HI> while others were incessantly making their Appearance in different Places round about. The Motion of them all was now pointed <HI>Upwards,</HI> &amp; reached some a greater &amp; some a lesser extent: But none above more than from about 8 or 10 Degrees of the <HI>Horizon</HI> to about 6 or 8 from the <HI>Zenith.</HI> For the most part they flashed unequally: But sometimes they seem'd to begin, shoot &amp; blaze all together &amp; made the Earth almost as light as Day. And then their Appearance was like a Thousand Glittering Swords or <HI>Blazing Stars</HI> shooting upwards from all sides of the <HI>Hemisphere,</HI> but leaving where their Points ended a vacant Space in the <HI>Center</HI> of about 10 or 12
<PB N="8" REF="002068_0010_0FBB793E03299DB8">
Degrees <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="4 letters">eter,</HI> &amp; sometimes of a roun|dish &amp; sometimes of various multangular Figures, directly over our Heads. For there seem'd to be a remarkable Part of the <HI>Heavens</HI> above us which they all vio|lently push'd at, but cou'd never enter.</P>
<P>THUS they continu'd their Exercise for about <HI>a Quarter of an Hour,</HI> but Decreased by Degrees both in Number, Quickness &amp; Brightness till they left the <HI>Heavens</HI> as they were before, &amp; indeed all the Time of this amazing Appearance almost as <HI>Clear</HI> I think as ever I saw them. It was the more unaccountable &amp; wonderful that there was no palpable Cloud hung over us: But we saw the <HI>Stars shining</HI> very plainly all the while in the Intervals of the Spears &amp; in the very Places where they were, as soon as ever they vanish'd; unless when the Brightness of the Apparition was so excessive as to drown their Light.</P>
<P>AFTER the <HI>Scene</HI> was over, which was a little before 8 of the Clock, there was ev'ry now &amp; then a single Flash or Streak or 2 of Light as before in divers Parts of the clear <HI>Firmament,</HI> &amp; some of these retain'd their Appearance for above the
<PB N="9" REF="002068_0011_0FBB7941BAEDD4A8">
Length of <HI>a Minute,</HI> which none of the other did ever reach near unto: But as the Light of these was always considera|bly fainter, so they proportionably conti|nued longer before they intirely vanish'd.</P>
<P>I THEN walked with a Gentleman out of the Town &amp; went up on a Rising Ground, whence we saw a <HI>thick &amp; light|some Cloud</HI> directly in the <HI>North,</HI> &amp; very near the <HI>Horizon</HI> if not adjoining to it, that appear'd exactly as if the <HI>Full Moon</HI> was behind it, which was not to rise till after <HI>Mid-night,</HI> &amp; that we suppos'd to be the <HI>Scource &amp; Mine-head</HI> of all this sur|prizing Train &amp; <HI>Fire-work of Nature.</HI> Ev'ry now &amp; then we saw <HI>Beams of Light</HI> issuing from it, somewhat like, but brigh|ter than those we often see from the <HI>Sun</HI> thro' the <HI>Crevices</HI> of a dark &amp; broken Cloud, that made it to resemble the <HI>Royal Artil|lery</HI> of Pikes, Spears &amp; Swords &amp; other Armour that are commonly plac'd under the <HI>Kings Picture.</HI> And as the Cloud arose the Streams increas'd &amp; flashed towards us, &amp; we thought the <HI>Aerial Armies</HI> were going to rally &amp; make another onset: But they retreated again, as the Cloud passed on by the <HI>Borders</HI> of the <HI>Horizon</HI> to the
<PB N="10" REF="002068_0012_0FBB794248AB7798">
<HI>West</HI> &amp; slowly moved to a greater Distance from us.</P>
<P>BY the Brightness of the <HI>Fiery Pillars</HI> &amp; the strange Illumination of the Air re|maining, I came home a foot about 10 of the Clock, when the Ground &amp; Heavens were every whit I think as light as imme|diately after <HI>Sun-set.</HI> I sat up &amp; watched till 3 in the <HI>Morning</HI> when I could dis|cern nothing more of them: But they con|tinu'd very visible till between 1 &amp; 2; when the <HI>Heavens</HI> began to be <HI>overspread</HI> with Clouds, &amp; the <HI>Moon arose,</HI> which put a gradual <HI>End</HI> to this real &amp; most incom|prehensible <HI>Vision.</HI></P>
<P>THUS have I given you a bare, &amp; I'm pretty sure an exact Historical Relation of Things as I saw them. I have repeated it to Several who were <HI>Spectators</HI> with Me, &amp; intirely agree to my Description of the Manner, Appearance &amp; Process of this won|derful Prodigy. I might easily make a great many <HI>Philosophical</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral Reflections</HI> on the Things I have written &amp; others I saw: But for several Reasons which you see I have not room for, I desire to be ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">us'd at Present.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002068_0013_0FBB7943CBFDB3C0">
I SHALL only take Notice, that whi|ther we consider the Part of the <HI>Natural Day,</HI> the Time of the <HI>Night,</HI> the State of the <HI>Sky,</HI> the Place of the <HI>Moon</HI> or the Sea|son of the <HI>Year;</HI> It was on all Accounts most conveniently suited &amp; order'd, &amp; therefore very plainly seems to be designed by PROVIDENCE for a general Observation &amp; Terrour. Accordingly we perceive alrea|dy that it was seen much in the same Manner &amp; at the same Time by Multitudes in the <HI>Towns &amp; Villages round about its,</HI> even to the Distance of 20 or 30 <HI>Miles,</HI> &amp; I believe in all <HI>these Parts</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> But I doubt you did not see so much of it at LONDON: Because we observed that the <HI>Southern Quarter</HI> from us which is over the City was in a great measure exempted from these Celestial Illuminations.</P>
<P>I SHALL Conclude with telling you, that at the Beginning, Rise &amp; Hight of this Apparition, I cou'd not sometimes forbear imagining, that Mr. WHISTON'S <HI>Hypothesis</HI> was coming to pass, &amp; that the Train of a <HI>Burning Comet</HI> was then a seizing on this Terrestial World. But when the Blazes, &amp; Pillars of Smoak ascended from ev'ry

side of the <HI>Horizon,</HI> I was then ready to think, the <HI>Subterranean Fires</HI> were violently and successively issuing out of gaping <HI>Caverns</HI> &amp; <HI>Vulcanoes</HI> in the Country round about us.</P>
