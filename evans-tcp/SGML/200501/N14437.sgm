<P>TO mark with accuracy and precision, the principles from which the great and important transactions on the theatre of the political world originate, is an indespensable duty, not only of legislators, but of every subject of a free State; fraught with the most instructive lessons on the passions that actuate the human breast, the inquiry is amply adapted to the purpose of regulating the social concerns of life.</P>
<P>THE laws and penalties by which subjects are compelled to promote the general interests of a community, should ever be instituted with a special reference to these principles, and the greatest perfection of human government consists in the judicious|ness of this application.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018292_0005_0FA5C6B300CDA870">THE constitution or frame of government in a republican State, is circumscribed by Barriers, which the ambitious or designing cannot easily remove, without giving the alarm to those whose priviledges might be infringed by the innovation; but that the principle of administration may be grossly corrupted, that the people may be abused, and enslaved under the best of constitutions, is a truth to which the annals of the world may be adduced to bear a melancholy attestation.</P>
<P>So silently have the advances of arbitary power been made. that a community has often been upon the verge of misery and servitude, whilst all was calm and tranquil in the State.</P>
<P>To revert to first principles is so essentially requsite to public happiness and safety, that Polybius has laid it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that every State must decline more or less rapidly, in proportion as she recedes from the principles on which she was founded. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyb. Hist. Lib. 6 P. 618.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT virtue is the true principle of republican governments <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Aristotle thinks there is not any one virtue belonging to the subjects of a despotic government.</P>
<BIBL>Polit. Lib. 1.</BIBL></NOTE> has been sufficiently proved by the ablest writers on the subject, and, that whereas other forms of government may be supported without her, yet that in this she is absolutely necessary to their existence.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018292_0006_0FA5C6B3ABEEA0B8">A GENERAL prevalence of that love for our country which teaches us to esteem it glorious to die in her defence, is the only means of perpetuating the enjoyment of that liberty and security, for the support of which all government was originally intended.</P>
<P>LAWS and punishments are but the ensigns of human depra|vity, to render them as few as the public safety will admit, is the study of every wise, humane legislature. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>A multiplicity of rigorous penal laws is not only incompatible with the liberty of a free state, but even repugnant to human nature.</P>

<P>THE contempt of dangers, and of death, when liberty was the purchase, has been the means of elevating to the highest pitch of glory, those famed Republics of antiquity, which later ages have considered as the models of political perfection; instructed from early infancy to deem themselves the property of the State, they were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests;
"dear to us (says the eloquent Cicero) dear to us are our Parents, dear are our Children, our Neighbours and Associates, but above all things, dear is our Country <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cicero de Offic.</NOTE>;"

"IT is impossible not to love a patriot, it is only loving him who loves us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gordon's Sallust. P. 41.</NOTE>
&mdash;it is impossible not to be charmed with the influences of those divine sentiments, which induced the brave Decii to devote themselves to certain Death, that they might ensure the Roman armies victory and glory.</P>
<P>THE celebrated story of the two Carthaginian brethren, who consented to be buried alive, to increase the boundaries of their Country, shews us to what an enthusiastic height this virtue may be carried.</P>
<P>AMONGST the Spartans, to return from the field of battle <HI>with</HI> or <HI>upon</HI> their shields, was equally glorious, and subject of joy and acclamation; to escape without them, an indelible mark of infamy and disgrace.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>public spirit</HI> proceeds almost every other virtue. The man who willingly would die to save his Country, would surely sacrifice his fortune and possessions, to secure her peace and happiness. The noble examples of frugality which were exhibited in the conduct of the Spartan governors, who began the reformation of the state, by delivering up their own private property, to convince the citizens that their intentions were sincere, is a proof how much it may be made to triumph over avarice and selfishness.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018292_0008_0FA5C6B5291F4090">THE Thebans, under the matchless Epaminondas, when they were deserted by their allies, and reduced to the greatest extre|mities, were by the wise example of their general, and frequent skirmishes with the enemy, inspired with a spirit of enterprize and bravery, which at length enabled them to vanquish thrice their number of Lacedemonian troops, and having slain their general, to march in hostile array to the very gates of Sparta.</P>
<P>THESE are the principles which have more or less animated the subjects of every state, that has arrived to any considerable degree of opulence and grandeur, and it is of the greatest use to observe how others have gradually crept into governments, and suppressed, or eradicated the public virtue of a people.</P>
<P>ALAS! to what amounts the summit of all human greatness! Sparta, the nurse of heroes and legislators, Athens, the seat of arts and sciences, Carthage the mart of all the trading nations, and even Rome, the haughty mistress of the world, have all long since been level'd with the dust! of all the states and cities of the globe that have experienced the like catastrophe, scarce can we mention one that has not met her ruin, in a forgetfulness of those <HI>fundamental principles</HI> on which her happiness depended.</P>
<P>So nearly is the most prosperous condition of a people, allied to decay and ruin, that even this flattering appearance

<BIBL>Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws, V. 1 P. 163.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>THE object of public virtue, is to secure the liberties of the community, a security of liberty admits of every man's pursuing, without molestation, the measures most likely to increase his ease, and to place him in a state of independent affluence, nothing is more conducive to these ends than a free and unlimited com|merce, the encouragement of which is undoubtedly the duty of the Commonwealth, and the feelings of humanity are, in a general sense, highly interested in the prosecution of it.</P>
<P>COMMERCIAL intercourse and connection have perhaps contributed more towards checking the effusion of blood, than all the obligations of morality and religion, in their usual state of debility, could ever have effected. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Peace is the natural effect of Trade.</P>
<BIBL>Montesquieu II. P. 2.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> The ideas of conquest and destruction amongst the ancients, were commonly compre|hended under the same term, and torrents of human blood have been shed to gratify a spirit of revenge; in latter times the views of almost every powerful nation with whom civilization has been the effect of trade, have been directed to the support of that political balance, upon which this intercourse depends.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="018292_0010_0FA5C6BA4B0D44F8">IN the quarrel between the Swedes and Danes, a short time previous to the restoration of Charles the second of England, and again in the reign of William the third, the Dutch and the English sent their fleets into the Baltic, to prevent those incon|veniencies that would have resulted to the commerce of the maritime powers, had either of those kingdoms been destroyed, and the same thing has taken place in the general wars against France. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide present state of Europe, P. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>CONSIDERED then as an instrument for lessening the calami|ties of war, humanity must ever exult in the countenance given to trade; the immediate effect of it, when extensive, is usually an augmentation of wealth, but as it is generally impossible for every subject to acquire a great degree of opulence, the riches of the state become accumulated in the coffers of a few; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Luxury is always proportional to the inequality of fortune.</P>
<BIBL>Montesquieu, I. P. 137.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> the passions of the great almost invariably extend to the body of the people, who to gratify an abounded thirst for gain, are ready to sacrifice every other blessing to that, which in any degree, furnishes them with the means of imitating their superiors; bribery and venality, the grand engines of slavery, have been called in to the assistance of the aspiring nobles, who, in this case, never fail to make the deluded people pay them the full price of their prostitution.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018292_0011_0FA5C6BA716D84C8">THIS accession of power, acquired by the consent of the people themselves, enables their governors to assume the reins of absolute controul, to burst all the bonds of social obligation, and finally to extort by violence, what formerly they were obliged to purchase; accustomed to a habit of sloth and idleness, the subjects are rendered too effeminate to apply themselves to labor and fatigue, or if they do it, are soon discouraged by the rapaciousness of their rulers, a spirit of faction and uneasiness becomes generally prevalent; impressed with that awful respect with which the trappings of wealth universally inspire a people that have been accustomed to view it as the measure of human felicity, they are too pusillanimous to relieve themselves from their burden by an united effort of the whole, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>China the <HI>richest</HI> and most populous commercial empire of the universe, was subdued by a handful of <HI>poor</HI> Tartars.</P>

<P>THE Carthaginians, says Montague, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On Republics, P. 339.</NOTE> stand single upon the records of history, the only people in the universe upon whom immense wealth has never been able to work its usual effects; but even in this instance it may perhaps reasonably be questioned, whether the factions that prevented the illustrious Hannibal from entering the gates of Rome, whilst he had filled that city with terror and dismay, were not the effect of opulence, and loss of public virtue. The introduction of wealth in the Roman republic, is dated at the conquest of Antiochus the great, and the aera of corruption from the same memorable period; what sluices of depravity and misery did they not open in the state! That senate which once resembled an assembly of Kings, whose rigid faith had rendered them the objects of univer|sal veneration whilst frugality and patriotism were held in estima|tion, can <HI>now</HI> meanly stoop to avail themselves of a quibble in the terms of a treaty, to destroy a City they had pledged their
<PB N="14" REF="018292_0013_0FA5C6BCB36D8AE8">
honour to preserve; that senate from which a single deputy had once caused a mighty monarch to tremble and obey, and bare|ly by the motion of his cane, obliged him, at the head of a victorious army, to resign his conquest, can now condescend to flatter the vilest passions, and bear to be insulted with the most humili|ating usage without daring to murmur or complain.</P>
<P>THE unparalled usurpations of Sylla, Marius, and Caesar are but variegated forms, in which are exhibited, the baneful effects of that adulatory submission, with which a base, degenerate, and corrupted people have become the instruments of tyranny and murder; the bloody proscriptions and licensed executions of those pests of the human race, which have disgraced the Roman name, were generally accompanied with the thanks of the Senate. Jugurtha, that infamous Numidian Prince, who ungratefully murdered the children of his benafactor, in this corrupted age of the Republic, secures himself from the punishment due to his crimes by bribing his Judges, and by the same means enables himself to enter the Roman camp, and make that army whose force he once had dreaded, submit to <HI>pass the yoke,</HI> the most ignominious punishment that could have been inflicted.</P>
<P>THE Roman Provinces would never so generally have submitted to the impositions of their rapacious governors, had not the minds of the people been prepared for them by their participa|tion in the manners of the citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="018292_0014_0FA5C6BD73EB9C58">WHEN once a State has arrived to this extreme degree of corruption, nothing short of a miracle can wrest it from destruc|tion; luxury and venality become a branch of education, and as nothing can operate so strongly on the minds of youth, as examples set by parental authority, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>The surest way of instilling into children a love for their country&punc; is, for parents to set the example.</P>

"Go traveller and tell at Lacedemon, that we died here in defence of her sacred laws."
&mdash;Philopaemen, the general of the Achaeans, was so fully persuaded that the only means of reducing this brave people to subjection and dependence, was to eradicate the principle of public virtue, that he attempted it, by endeavouring to change the manner of their education. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The people will never fail to pursue right measures for the security of their liberties, if they are but rightly informed; and it is a pleasing con|sideration that the means of education, and the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ion of the sciences, are so generally the objects of public attention in these <HI>rising confederated states.</HI></NOTE> A change was afterwards effected, a taste for luxury inculcated, Athens subjected to her arms, her spoils and riches seized with greediness, corruption ensued, and ruin closed the drama.</P>
