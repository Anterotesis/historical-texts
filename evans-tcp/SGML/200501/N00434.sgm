<HEAD>ANSWER upon the Maquas Sachims Propositions; by the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the City of Albany, and Military Officers of the said City and County: At the City-Hall, Febr. 26th. 1689</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Interpreted by Arnout, &amp;c</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your coming here according to the Custome of your Ancestors, to Condole the death of your <HI>Brethren</HI> Mur|thered at <HI>Shennechtady</HI> is very acceptable, whereby your Inclination towards us is Demonstrated; we must acknowledg that they did not keep so good Watch as they ought, considering what a false and deceitful Enemy they had to deal withal, but that which made them so secure, was, the great Trust which they Reposed in the forty <HI>Maquass</HI> who came here, and Tendered their Service to go and be the Out|watch, and to spy the Enemy: To which end Powder and Lead
<PB N="6" REF="000545_0006_0FA6B6526A3F4308">
was given them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they desired; we were about Hiring Chri|stians to send thither, but were unhappily diverted by the said Company of <HI>Maquass,</HI> who promised to have four Posts ready, two to go to their own Country, and two to come hither if a|ny Enemy should appear. For the Brethren did assure us, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>French</HI> could come here without being Discovered; and then would all fall into our hands: We are likewise mindful, how that the five Nations last <HI>Fall,</HI> when the Gentlemen of <HI>New-England</HI> were here did Declare how they would Encompass the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada,</HI> that they could not break out this Winter, without being Discovered and Fallen upon: We did likewise propose by our Messengers, <HI>Arnout,</HI> and <HI>Robert Sanders</HI> at the General Meeting of <HI>Onnondage</HI> to have Three or Four Hundred Men sent hither to be ready on all occasions, but see none.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> this Evil is done and cannot be called back again, and the only means to prevent the like for the future, is to keep good Watch, and to have good courage to oppose and resist the Enemy. We are no wayes Discomfited for this mis|fortune. It is the fortune of War, we do not fear to be even with the <HI>French</HI> in a short time; we have already sent Let|ters to all our Neighbours of <HI>New-England, Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary|Land,</HI> the Subjects of the great King of <HI>England,</HI> and acquainted them of the <HI>Evil</HI> done here by the <HI>French,</HI> and how requisite it is, that Ships be fitted out with all convenient speed, to go to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> and to press the business the more, we do now send persons to <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> a purpose to lay open the Case before them. And to perswade them to Rig out Ves|sels not only to hinder Succour coming from <HI>France,</HI> but to take <HI>Quebeck</HI> it self: as also to send more Men hither, that we may then send Men along with you to annoy the Enemy in their Country In the mean time we recommend the <HI>Brethren</HI> to send for
<PB N="7" REF="000545_0007_0FA6B653A0337FF0">
<HI>two hundred Men</HI> from the upper Nations, to joyn with you, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> keep the <HI>French</HI> in continual Alarm, and do them what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> imaginable; and <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">dages</HI> and <HI>Sinnekes</HI> must go down the Ri|ver of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and meet one another about <HI>Mont Royal</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> annoy the Enemy there: we shall in the mean while <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Town, and put our selves in a good posture of Defence, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we may not be Surprized, as they of <HI>Shennechtady</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> make all Preparations to oppose the Enemy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brethren</HI> see that we are in War with <HI>France,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> there is no time to speak of Peace. The <HI>French</HI> as you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> observe have fallen on both ends of the Chain, but not broke <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Let us keep the Covenant so much the faster, which never has had the least crack since the very first the <HI>Christians</HI> came here: They strove to lull us as all asleep, by their Messengers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Onnondage,</HI> speaking of Peace, and then they were upon the way, hither to commit this Murther.</P>
<P>&rindx; The <HI>Brethren</HI> need not fear for a <HI>Cessation</HI> to hinder us to pursue the Enemy, for as we told you before, the KING that ordered <HI>that,</HI> was a <HI>Papist,</HI> and a great Friend of the <HI>French;</HI> But our present Great KING will pursue the War to the outmost: Therefore we must all prepare for War. It will therefore be very requisite that the <HI>Brethren</HI> for their better Security come and Plant this Summer at <HI>Shinnechtady</HI> upon the Land that can|not be cultivated this year, that we may be near to one another upon any occasion. Concerning the Proposition of the <HI>Shackkook</HI> Indians, 'tis concluded on some dayes ago, to propose to the <HI>Shack|kook</HI> Indians the Planting on <HI>Marte Gerritse</HI> Island hard by the Town, and the River <HI>I</HI>ndians that live below shall also come to|gether to be ready on all occasions.</P>
<P>We must <HI>I</HI>nsist and Recommend you to perswade them of <HI>Oneyde</HI> to send the <HI>Priest</HI> hither, for you have seen how dangerous
<PB N="8" REF="000545_0008_0FA6B653B8DF3440">
it is to have such persons among you, who informs the Enemy of all your doings, and discovers all our Designs, we shall secure him that he Run not away, and when the Owner demands him, and these Troubles are over, shall be Delivered, for he can do more harm in <HI>Oneyde</HI> than an hundred men.</P>
<P>We think it Convenient that one or two of the <HI>Sachims</HI> stay here, and that a <HI>Sachim</HI> of each Nation be here to assist in the management of the Affairs of the War. There was given them six Belts of <HI>Wam|pom,</HI> some <HI>Duffils,</HI> Tobacco, and some Bags with Provision.</P>
<P><HI>A</HI>fter the Proposition was answered, they gave a Shout according to their Custome, which signified <HI>Amen,</HI> that they would continue the War to the utmost.</P>
<P>After the said Answer was made, The <HI>Maquas Sachems</HI> said after they had Repeated our Answer. We are glad to see that you are not Discouraged, A mistake can be made by the best and wisest of men, and we must see now to Pursue the War with all Vigour, we have an hundred men out in Pursuit of the Enemy still, who are good Sko<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s; in the mean time, we expect all the <HI>Sachims</HI> of the Upper Nations to Consult with us, who will come to Condole the Death of our <HI>Bre|thren</HI> Murthered at <HI>Shennechtady:</HI> You need not fear our being Rea|dy, we are soon fitted out, our Ax is in our hand. But take care for your selves to be in Readiness. The Ships that must do the principal work are long a F<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ting out and Rigging; we do not Design to go out with a small Troop as Skouts, but as soon as the Nations come together; we will go with a whole Army to Ruine the Coun|try. The Buisiness must be soon brought to a Period; therefore send in all haste to <HI>New-England,</HI> for we nor you cannot live long in this Condition; we must order it so, that the <HI>French</HI> be in a continual Fear and Alarm, and that is the way to be in Peace here.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Shakkook</HI> Indians in our Opinion they lye well where they are, as a good Watch, They are our Children, we will take care that they do their Duty, but as for the <HI>Indians</HI> that live be|low the Town, Them we mean must be sent for up, and got to Plant and live together, to be always in Readiness upon occasion.</P>
