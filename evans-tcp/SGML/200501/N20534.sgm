</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SLAVERY is one of the greatest calam|ities of human life. In a civil view, it is extreme|ly burdensome; as it respects religion, it is in|tolerable. It is torture to the body; but it is death to the mind.</P>
<P>Liberty, on the contrary, is the light and life and happiness of mankind. It opens to them all the valuable resources in creation. It originates their enterprize, and stimulates their industry. It gives to the mind all its improvements, to the manners all their independence. It is what con|stitutes the sweets of toil, the alacrity of study, the charm of wealth, the consolations of poverty, the endearments of friendship and social connec|tions; what prepares a throne for the exaltation and glory of religion; what diffuses cheerfulness through the world.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026940_0005_0FD26EF92E4B2A70">So thought the noble spirits, from whom we boast our descent. Impressed with these senti|ments of freedom, and suffering, at the same time, the scourge of ecclesiastic tyranny, in their native isle, they framed a purpose, whose accomplish|ment is an event of no inconsiderable magnitude, in the history of America. Our ancestors aban|doned the shores of Britain: they sought the rights of conscience and of man amid Columbian wilds.</P>
<P>In this country, they found in perfection that religious freedom, the want of which, at the first, inspired them with the ardor of emigration, and which, with aid from the divine providence, had continued to supply them with the firmness, neces|sary for completing so hazardous a design.</P>
<P>Still, our progenitors, with their descendants, were subjects of the English government. They were connected with it by ties of affection and loyalty, as well as of interest. During the space of one century and a half, the colonies of New-England, together with the southern provinces of this continent, were united to their mother coun|try. The interest of America was that of Britain; and Britain's sorrows drew tears from America. Conjoined they fought their battles; together they shared the spoils of the common foe. England, like a kind parent, long protected and fostered Columbia, who, in turn, like a dutiful child, car|ried home the little earnings of its industry, and cast them into the mother's lap.</P>
<P>The colonial population and wealth soon be|came considerable in the eye of Great-Britain. In time, they raised her pride; at length, they ex|cited her jealousy. Accordingly our taxes were gradually, but severely, augmented. She proceed|ed to raise from us a revenue without our consent. A measure of this kind was not to be tolerated.
<PB N="7" REF="026940_0006_0FD26EFA8544E850">
It subsided.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The noted <HI>Stamp Act</HI>&punc; which obliged the colonists to pay a heavy duty on <HI>stamped paper,</HI> and to use that only for bonds, notes, &amp;c. was passed in Parliament, March, 1765, and repealed in the same month of the following year. The repeal, however, was succeeded by a <HI>Decla|ratory Act</HI> more subversive of colonial liberty, than the former. It said, "That the Parliament had, and of right, ought to have, the pow|er to bind the colonies, in all cases whatsoever:</NOTE> Yet other acts of parliament,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Tea Act</HI> of 1767, the <HI>Boston Port Bill</HI> of 1774, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Bill</HI> of 1775.</NOTE> equally injurious in their tendency, shortly followed.</P>
<P>A panic of grief and disaffection had now struck|en the breasts of Americans. We groaned by rea|son of oppression. We unitedly formed the reso|lution of supplicating the king. We petitioned. We petitioned in vain. We remonstrated; but without effect. Our petitions were answered by frowns; our remonstrances, with accumulated burdens.</P>
<P>THUS WERE WE ONCE ENTANGLED WITH THE YOKE OF BONDAGE.</P>
<P>But the time of trial and danger was nigh. Longer forbearance, on the part of Britain, who had proceeded thus far, had been subversive of her controul. Her edicts must meet compliance. We steadily refuse it. She must then exercise the usual engine of tyranny. She durst to do it; and, as if forsaken by the guardians of her interest and her God poured into our metropolis her mercen|ary legions, to enforce, with the ball and bayonet, the execution of those laws, which could not re|ceive our voluntary obedience.</P>
<P>The charm was now dissolved. The bond, which, by some nameless enchantment, tied us to the feet of Albion, broke. The vizard had fallen from her face. Her purposes of subjugation and vassalage were manifest. We, therefore, feared not to examine the foundation of <HI>hereditary right,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="026940_0007_0FD26EFBDD41BF00">
nor openly to question the <HI>prerogative of kings.</HI> We found them a nullity. We named them harmless creatures, that were born in the brains of despots only, and nursed by the false fears of their flatterers. It was, thence, determined, they should no longer affright us. We resolved on opposition to a monarchic claim, which, hostile to the inten|tions of nature and nature's God, would enslave us and our children forever. We would alienate ourselves from the crown; a crown, which glit|tered, at the distance of three thousand miles, not, as formerly, with the mild rays of apparent free|dom, but with the fiery terrors of arbitrary pow|er, but too openly avowed. We swore no longer to crouch the involuntary minions of a sovereign, whose corrupt ministry and venal parliament were wresting from our possession the last remains of liberty. We grasped the sword. Fresh acts of British insolence and cruelty forced it from the scabbard. We then appealed to heaven for the justice of our defence. Our appeal was heard; and the cry, to arms! with a pious enthusiasm, resounded throughout the cities and forests of A|merica.</P>
<P>I pass, in silence, the horrors of that memorable night,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between the 18, and 19, of April, 1775.</NOTE> when the troops of Britain covered the plains of Lexington, encrimsoning them with the earliest effusion of American blood, and uttering, from the cannon's mouth, an unwelcome prologue to those sanguinary scenes, which were afterwards acted in all parts of the continent. I will not throw gloom on this joyous hour by the descrip|tion of that day of carnage, when the streams of Concord were tinged with human gore, and first learned to flow in union with the life of their countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026940_0008_0FD26EFE1E8F0B38">It is enough, that hostilities were seriously com|menced; that combinations, spirited and effectu|al, for the prosecution of the war, were formed among the provinces; and that we persisted in our righteous cause, with various success, until the <HI>fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thou|sand, seven hundred, amd seventy six, when, by our delegates, in congress assembled, we declared our|selves,</HI>
"united, free, sovereign, and independent States!"</P>
<P>WE ARE NOW DISENTANGLED FROM THE YOKE OF BONDAGE.</P>
<P>This is the day, my countrymen, and this the event, we now celebrate. This act, at once, and forever, dismembered us from Great Britain. It shivered to atoms an accursed yoke, which neith|er we, nor our fathers, were able to bear. In this one day, our nation was born; and modestly assumed rank with the old empires of the world.</P>
<P>Hail, happy day! <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> epoch, hail! Since which, our earth hath twice times nine performed her annual courses round the orb of day, and at each revolution, seen her favored country independent. Thrice hail! most auspicious era, whose genial light discovered a path to the posterior victory and peace of the United States. Yes, friends, it was the prototype of the present anniversary, that formed the characters in which your national feli|city has long been so fairly written. It is hence, I am enabled, at this time, to gratulate you, as having, for eighteen years, eaten the bread, drunk+ken the waters, spoken the language, worn the habits, of sons and daughters of liberty. The Almighty forever grant, that ye</P>
<P>BE NOT AGAIN ENTANGLED WITH THE YOKE OF BONDAGE!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026940_0009_0FD26F0099F537C8" MS="y">This, Americans, is not, however, to be expec|ed by miraculous interpositions of the divine pro|vidence. To preserve yourselves free and inde|pendent, the same efforts, in kind, must be em|ployed, which first unbound your millions from the tyranny of England. To this end, in parti|cular, two things must principally conduce. They are <HI>a due cultivation of useful and religious knowl|edge, and some very considerable attention to the mi|litary art.</HI></P>
<P>Of the importance of the former, towards at|taining the object proposed, all history is a full eviction. That of the Jews, though their gov|ernment, for the most part, was monarchical, is instanced. This nation never enjoyed their im|munities in a higher degree, than under the reign of King Solomon. It was because he taught them the arts and sciences of life, and gave them les|sons of religion and virtue. Both before this time, and in subsequent periods, while they understood and kept their law, they maintained their freedom from foreign thraldom. As soon, as they became careless of their scriptures, and idolatrous in their practices, they lost their Canaan, they were car|ried into captivity. And why were they so long in bondage? Why, for four hundred years, pre|viously to the advent of Messiah, were they fav|oured with neither message nor deliverance from on high? Was it not because, O Jerusalem, thou killedst thy prophets, and stonedst them, who were sent to instruct thee?</P>
<P>What raised the states of antient Greece to the possession of such perfect liberty, except learning? What, if not their virtues, so long preserved their noble independence? It was the literature of the Romans; it was their regard to the gods, and their virtuous principles&punc; which, for ages, gave to
<PB N="11" REF="026940_0010_0FD26F041BD7F1E8" MS="y">
them the sovereignty of the earth. But when ig|norance succeeded to the learning of these mighty republics; when a sense of moral obligations ceas|ed to be cherished among them, then their freedom was exchanged for servitude; their independence, for vassalage.</P>
<P>I point you to more modern times. Look in|to the extensive realms of Asia. Look also into Africa. See those most ancient quarters of the globe overspread with despotism. At the same time, know, that want of good and general educa|tion is the melancholy cause.</P>
<P>Survey that part of the world, which has some|times prided itself, as containing all the knowledge and all the virtue of the present age; survey Eu|rope. Ye shall there find, I may say, millions of human beings. Known to be such only by their countenance and form. What is their political condition? Very little better, than that of down|right slavery. To the ignorance and consequent vices of the commonalty of Europe is it owing, that they are so universally the submissive subjects of monarchies completely absolute, of monar|chies but too unlimited, or, at best, of aris|tocracies, where the nobles are like mountains, which, though they prevent not the sun from shin|ing, yet effectually engross its influence from the vales below. Hence multitudes of Europeans have scarcely the shadow of liberty. Hence, their countless hosts, are now forced into war, in op|position to their will, and are at this moment, butchering, in cold blood, their brothers of the human race, whom they never saw, and, therefore cannot but love, solely to gratify the ambition and avarice of some few despots, or some dozens of aspiring demagogues. These are thy trophies, ignorance!</P>
<P>It is but iust to acknowledge, that the republic
<PB N="12" REF="026940_0011_0FD26F0946FE5438">
of France now makes an exception to these re+marks. It is to be hoped, she wages war with ty|ranny, not with men; that she fights for freedom, not for conquest; that her soldiery carry with them their hearts to the battle; and that her cause is that of all mankind. May God blot out her crimes, and establish her liberties!</P>
<P>I cease referring you to remote proofs of the truth, I would impress upon your minds. With|in the compass of your own unavoidable observa|tion, freemen, ye have plenary evidence, that na|tional freedom and independence cannot be pro|pagated and supported, except by the means of national knowledge and religion. To the succes|ful operation of these means, ye are vastly indebt|ed for the glorious event, which is this day cele|brated. It was your universities, your accadem|ies, your schools, those nurseries of learning; it was your churches, those nurseries of virtue, that prepared the way for your independence, and di|rected you to the measures of effectuating a revo|lution, which has astonished the universe.</P>
<P>Let those seminaries of science, then, be still the objects of your regard and charity; let your temples continue to command your reverence and love. Thither conduct your youth and children. Teach them knowledge, and they will, probably, <HI>preserve</HI> their freedom; teach them religion, and they will be sure to use <HI>rightly</HI> that inestimable blessing.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the due cultivation of useful and religious knowledge, among a free people, has a direct tendency to the maintenance of their liberties, it is not, yet, alone, invariably, effectu|al to that end. The present corrupted state of civil society seems to render other means of self defence, than just reasonings and upright conduct, often necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="026940_0012_0FD26F0AE2484A78">A principle of self preservation is the first prin|ciple in nature. It was implanted there by na|ture's author. Self preservation is then a part of natural religion. And if so, it is not repugnant to revealed religion. On the other hand, we know, that personal defence, and the preservation of po|litical rights, were not only, by means of arms, permitted, but enjoined on the Jews. They of|tentimes, indeed, waged war, by the divine com|mand, for the sake of conquest. It is true, our Savior introduced a new dispensation among men. He came not to destroy, but to save, the lives of mankind. He confessed on a remarkable occa|sion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> that his kingdom was not of this world; and at the same time, expressed his pleasure, that his servants should not fight to defend it. But Jesus neither thou, nor ever, forbade his servants to preserve with the sword their natural rights and political governments, when <HI>to</HI> preserve them, other means of defence became insufficient.</P>
<P>In order, now, that arms be successfully em|ployed, when an assumption of them against an enemy shall be justifiable on the principles of rea|son and religion, it is evidently proper, that an acquaintance with them be obtained, when no im|mediate necessity for them is apparent. Else the sudden invasion of a country will be the destruc|tion of its liberties. And such an invasion, by the rapacious and tyrannical, may always be ex|pected from a people, who, rising in the scale of wealth and national importance, are yet in the habits of ease, and in utter neglect of the warlike arts. So that, as long, as principles of injustice and disorder maintain any authority over the king|doms of this world, so long must even a christian nation, to preserve their independence, train their bodies to the exercise of arms, as well, as their mind to knowledge and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026940_0013_0FD26F0C676D27A8" MS="y">America, however, especially this common|wealth, has tasted the too bitter effects of stand|ing armies, in time of peace. From what other quarter, then, are we to expect that skill and the military art, which forms the seeond mean of pre|venting future subjection to a yoke of bondage? From the brave and well disciplined militia of the land. It is from you,</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen officers and soldiers,</HI> who compose a part of the militia of the United States; it is from you we expect that theoretic acquaintance with the art of war, which, when occasion presses, will enable you to be our sure defence, and which your profession, and the love of glory will incite you to obtain. Your daily culture of the arts of peace, and the sweets of domestic repose, must not cause you to forget, that ye are soldiers, and that ye af|fist to form one strong and beautiful pillar of your country's freedom. Amid your agricultural pur|suits, the acquisition of some knowledge in tacticks will certainly claim a portion of your time; nor will your arms be permitted to rust through an uninterrupted attention to mechanic employments. Frequent exertions in the line of military duty will serve, as an agreeable relaxation from sever|er occupations, will feed the flame of patriotism in your souls, and gently inure your bodies to the fatigues of a camp.</P>
<P>In proportion, as a prospect of war, at any time, increases, your exercise of arms will be more sol|emn and vigorous. Would! I were permitted to tell you, that the politicks of our nation now wear no threatening aspect. I am forbidden to suppress my fears in this respect.</P>
<P>Men in arms! The present day is pregnant with events of uncommon magnitude. War blows his clarion among the nations. The temple of
<PB N="15" REF="026940_0014_0FD26F0DE4E5C530">
Janus is opened in all the world. The battle of the European warriors is indeed with a confused noise. It is the bruit of a war, which originated, on the one hand, in the too sanguine hope of planting the tree of liberty in every clime, and is prosecuted, on the other, with an unwarrantable acrimony against a mighty nation, struggling to be free, if not in direct repugnance to the natural rights of mankind, and the laws of eternal justice. If, in this huge contest between the sentiments of equal liberty, and the unnatural systems of arbitary power, the latter should prevail, America, in tears, will behold the triumph. It is even possible she may be called to defend anew her present claim to the joys of independence. Should such an event, in this age of war, betide us, which God avert! to you, as to the supporters of your country's rights, shall we look for protection. If ever called to the field, we trust, ye will remember from whom ye descend. Ye will recollect, that ye are no other, than the pure progeny of those rare heroes, who preferred the horrors of a wilderness, with liberty, to the refinements of civilized life, with an a|bridgement of their native rights; who braved the dangers of an untried ocean; hazarded the bar|barity of savages; endured the whole of toils, in|cident to the planters of a new world. Ye will feel, that ye are the brethren, and the sons, of men, who, in our late glorious conflict, won wreaths of laurel on the plains of Mars; men who almost worshipped liberty; who relinquished all they dearest held to fight her cause; who, in the mo|ment of encounter, made bare their bosoms to the sword, and received a copious death. The same cause, the same motives, will swell your breasts, and urge you to like valor. Already we own your guardian power. To you, your fair wives and
<PB N="16" REF="026940_0015_0FD26F1010122A90">
smiling children, your paternal houses and your grounds, your hearths, your household goods, to you, the religion of your country, and the taber|nacles of your God, to you all these even now look up for safety. Again, I say, should ye be summoned to their defence, may ye seek its glory at the very point of the sabre! And may the God of armies, the Lord of hosts, he who led our Washington, with the troops of Columbia, to for|mer victories, may that God cover your heads in the day of battle! May he teach your hands to war, and your fingers to fight; enable you to be of good courage, to play the men for your people, and the cities of your God; and return you to the embraces of your fond friends, and your loved firesides, loaded with the spoils of righteous con|quest, and your temples filleted with garlands of well earned fame!</P>
<P><HI>Christian friends and fellow citizens!</HI> It is beau|tiful to behold the mingled pleasure and devotions, with which ye honor this national festival. Would ye annually bring like offerings to liberty? Cul|tivate the means, by which she was first won. Unite in cherishing every species of useful and re|ligious knowledge, and to their literary and hu|mane acquirements, let your sons add hardihood and skill in the arts of war. Thus shall ye be pro|perly prepared to defend your valuable soil. Thus shall ye testify your justi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> attachment to the FED|ERAL CONSTITUTION, that prodigy of human wisdom, and glory of your land; reward the ser|vices of your old and faithful rulers; keep invio|late the rights of conscience, and the voluntary worship of God; and, in fine, ye may thus ra|tionally hope, that the raptures of independence, which now thrill your veins, will circulate with the blood of all your descendents</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="026940_0016_0FD26F12878EFB78">In giving these <HI>mixed</HI> exhortations, let it not be thought, that I deviate from the path of a christian minister. Christianity is a religion full of truth, and full of reason. And the knowledge of truth, and the exercise of reason, as they constitute the greatest individual freedom, so they impel to the devising and recommending of all lawful means for the security of freedom among communities and nations.</P>
<P>Let it, nevertheless, be seriously remembered, that, apart from temporary and political consider|ations, we are, in a peculiar sense, the scholars, and the soldiers of Jesus Christ. We are taught in his school; we are enlisted under his banner. It is true, none of us has ever been entangled with the yoke of Jewish ordinances, nor been bound to the observance of mosaic rites. But we have all, alas! been too much enslaved by bad passions, too much under the dominion of evil habits. Let us break the yoke of this unnatural and worst kind of bond|age from off us, and never again be entangled with it. Through the knowledge of our Lord and his gospel, let us conquer all our vices, and surrender ourselves to the possession of those vir|tues, which, it is designed, shall give the truest liberty to the human race. For however numer|ous the present captives of sin, rejoice in this, ye followers of Jesus, christianity shall yet emanci|pate the world. It shall do more. It shall en|franchise the prisoners of the tomb. The time shall come, when&punc; loosed from the bands of death and the grave, the disciples of virtue, universally, shall own your Master, as the Captain of their redemption, who, putting palms of victory in their hands and crowns of glory on their heads.
