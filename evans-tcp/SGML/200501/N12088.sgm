<HEAD>THE FRONTISPIECE</HEAD>
<P>EXHIBITS a view of what is represented in the last scene of the fourth act of the Tragedy.</P>
<P>The principal figure on the fore-ground is the corpse of Montgomery, with the arm thrown back and stretched at full length, in the casual man|ner in which one slain in battle may be supposed to have fallen. Near him, is the body of Macpherson, and at some distance on the left, that of Captain Cheeseman, slain at the same instant, by one discharge of grape shot. In the next view we have Major Burr, Aid-de-Camp, standing over the mangled remains of these gallant heroes, in the attitude of addressing them, in the language of funeral eulogium. On his right is Colonel Campbell, who having commanded a retreat, returns to the fatal spot and counsels Major Burr to retire with him, pointing to the city of Quebec, whence Maclean is supposed to issue with his forces in order to surround them.</P>
<P>Lastly, we see the Ghost of General Wolfe, appearing from the banks of the St. Lawrence river, and approaching half inveloped in a cloud; his left hand on the wound which he received in his breast, and his right hand, the wrist of which appears to be bound up, addressed to Major Burr, while he laments with him the tragic scene before them, but fore|tels the happy resentment and opposition to the British tyranny which it will naturally produce in the minds of the Americans. He also antici|pates the pleasing view of the certain overthrow of the British arms, and the final glory of an Independent Empire in America.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I EMBRACE the opportunity of this publication, to express my veneration of your character; not from any of those smaller motives which are attributed to Authors in their dedications; but simply, because it is my "delight to do you honour."</P>
<P>Indeed every friend of virtue and of mankind, must esteem a Gentleman, who, from the beginning, has so warmly asserted the cause of liberty, and hence may be reckoned in the number of those pure patriots, who with underived heat and lustre, first shone out in op|position to the British counsels. For I count them but a second class of men who have slowly taken fire at the patriotism of their neighbours. They may de|serve true praise, yet they have not attained to the ho|nour of the "first worthies."</P>
<P>Every officer and soldier who has fought under your command, since the commencement of the war, speaks of your nobleness of spirit, your frank demeanor, hu|mane and generous deportment, with a warmth of ap|probation which only true love and real admiration
<PB REF="015249_0006_0F9883AAB9611E10">
could inspire. The inhabitants of Philadelphia attri|bute to you, under GOD, and the good conduct of General WASHINGTON, the salvation of their city. For perhaps no other person could so effectually have roused the Militia of the Pennsylvania State to en|counter the hardships of a campaign, in the depth of winter, even though the object of their enterprize was noble, the repelling the British forces from the banks of the Delaware.</P>
<P>I shall not detain you longer from more important services, but take my leave by wishing you a continu|ance of life beyond the AEra of the war, that you may behold the matured Blessings of that Liberty and Glory, which you have so gallantly assisted to establish.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>IT is my request that the following Dramatic Composition may be considered only as a school piece. For though it is written according to the pre|scribed rules of the Drama, with the strictest atten|tion to the unities of time, place, and action, yet it differs materially from the greater part of those mo|dern performances which have obtained the name of Tragedy. It is intended for the private entertainment of Gentlemen of taste, and martial enterprize, but by no means for the exhibition of the stage. The subject is not love but valour. I meddle not with any of the effeminating passions, but consecrate my muse to the great themes of patriotic virtue, bravery and heroism.</P>
<P>With respect to the particular merit of the piece, I have only to say, that I flatter myself it would have been more deserving of attention, had it been drawn up in less haste. It is found by all who have at|tempted it, that at least one year is necessary to the composition of a good Tragedy. The following was made out at different intervals in the space of a few weeks, and therefore, according to the rule before-mentioned, it must be supposed to come far short of perfection. Writing in this way is my amusement not my business. But here it may be observed, that no man pays attention to the time spent in composing, but to the merit of the performance when it makes its ap|pearance. Could not I have kept this small affair to myself some time longer, if after that period, it would have been in my power to have produced it more elegant and pleasing? I answer, that one
<PB REF="015249_0008_0F9883AC3A9B8658">
great foundation of the merit of any performance is its being seasonable. An oration, eulogium, or production of any kind, in honour of our brave countrymen who have fallen, or of those who do yet contend in the glorious cause of freedom, is likely to do greater good and will be more acceptable at pre|sent, than hereafter when the foe is intirely repulsed and the danger over.</P>
<P>For this reason I submit it in its present state to the candid and generous, with my promise, that when it shall be in my power to afford time to revise and amend it, I will endeavour to give it to the World in a Second Edition, more <HI>correct</HI> and <HI>finished.</HI></P>

<L>With steps resolv'd ye trod the hostile wood,</L>
<L>Where famine threatens and where murders brood.</L>
<L>For Britain's glory, flow'd the purple vein,</L>
<L>Warm from the heart to prop a Brunswick's reign.</L>
<L>How chang'd the scene! no more with friendly hand</L>
<L>To aid thy pow'r, we leave our native land.</L>

Burst are those ties, alas! and scatter'd wild,</L>
<L>That join'd the Parent to the faithful child:</L>
<L>Fatal ambition, to each vice ally'd,</L>
<L>Dire mischief's progeny, the child of pride;</L>
<L>These wars malign, from thy curst genius flow</L>
<L>Those fields of slaughter, and those scenes of woe;</L>

<L>While Britain's union streams upon the walls,</L>
<L>Our hardy troops to fierce encounter calls.</L>
<L>Now round each heart, fair freedom spreads her flame,</L>

<L>THE third hour turning from the midnight watch,</L>
<L>By no ray visited of moon or star,</L>

<L>Now from above, on every hill and copse,</L>
<L>The airy element, descends in snow,</L>
<L>And with the dark winds, from the howling north,</L>
<L>Commix'd and driven on the bounded sight,</L>
<L>Gives tumult privacy, and shrouds the march;</L>

<L>May undistinguish'd, to the very walls,</L>

May force the barr'd gates, of this lofty town,</L>
<L>On all sides, bound, with artificial rock,</L>
<L>Of cloud-cap'd eminence, impregnable.</L>
<L>Impregnable, so long, and fully proof,</L>
<L>To all our batt'ry, and sharp cannonade;</L>
<L>But yet assail'd with vigour, and full force,</L>
<L>This morn, I trust, we enter it, in storm,</L>
<L>And, from its bosom long defiled, pluck,</L>
<L>This scorpion progeny, this mixed brood,</L>
<L>Of wild-wood Savages, and Englishmen,</L>
<L>Who 'gainst their brethren, in unrighteous cause,</L>
<L>With cruel perfidy, have waged war.</L>
<L>Against their brethren, did I say? O God!</L>
<L>Are we the offspring of that cruel foe,</L>
<L>Who late, at Montreal, with symbol dire,</L>
<L>Did call, the Savages, to taste of blood,</L>
<L>Life-warm, and streaming, from the bullock slain,</L>
<L>And with fell language, told it was the blood,</L>
<L>Of a Bostonian, made the sacrament?</L>
<L>At this, the Hell-hounds, with infernal gust,</L>
<L>To the snuff'd wind, held up, their blood-stain'd mouths,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Honorable the Continental Congress, appear to have been so struck, with this fact, which was amply authenticated to them, in a let|ter from His Excellency General Schuyler, as to have caused is to be published a second time, for the consideration of every American. What indeed could serve, to give us a more horrible idea, of the diabolical spirit of tyranny, than to have, presented to our view, General Carlton, or his officers, by his direction, convening the Indians, at Montreal; roasting an ox, and inviting them, under that symbol, to partake of a Bostonian? I know this may be called an Address to the Savages, in their own dialect, which is by strong imagery and visible representation; but certainly it is a style of figurative language, which only the imagi|nation of an arbitrary and cruel Englishman, could in our age have con|ceived.</P>
<P>The Poet Eschylus, painting a transaction, which happened, in the barbarous times of Greece, though he had at his command the whole tribe of Furies, Demons, and triple-headed Monsters, with which the antients had stored their infernals; yet could draw nothing from them, so black and terrible, as a representation of this nature. Little did he think, that what he then, in the heat of poetic fury, had conceived, would one day be reduced to matter of fact and plain practice, by those who call themselves a civilized people. In a dramatic piece, styled The Seven Commanders at Thebes, we have the description.</P>
<LG>
<L>The seven dark Chiefs, in gloomy a titude,</L>
<L>Stood round; and o'er the brazen shield, they slew,</L>
<L>A sullen bull; then plunging deep their hands</L>
<L>Into the foaming gore, with oaths invoked,</L>
<L>Fierce war, mad fury, and blood-thirsting rage.</L>
</LG>
<P>This would seem to be the very original whence General Carlton, had copied the idea of his cantico; so true is it that the same black passions, will in every age, produce the same dark thoughts and purposes.</P></NOTE> And fill'd, with howlings, the adjacent hills.</L>

<L>Yes, brave Montgomery, I have heard the tale;</L>
<L>When from the brow, of many a desart wood,</L>

<L>The yelling Savage. Onondago wild,</L>
<L>Fierce Outawae, and half extinguish'd brood,</L>
<L>Of aged Huron, native habitant,</L>
<L>Of those high plains, where long their wigwams stood,</L>

<L>By these our butchers butchers of the ox</L>
<L>First slain, symbolical, in place of us.</L>

<L>The Indian warrior, tasted it, and sware,</L>

<L>Or laying the expectation, and high hope, in dust.</L>
<L>He can give courage to the warrior's breast,</L>

<L>Far other thought, O Campbell, fill'd my mind,</L>
<L>When first, a soldier, on the Abraham's heights,</L>
<L>I stood in arms. Then, in Britannia's cause,</L>
<L>I drew my sword, and charg'd the rival Gaul.</L>
<L>I felt for her a patriot's generous heat;</L>

<L>Full, in my memory, I retain the view;</L>
<L>Each circumstance, as if but yesterday.</L>
<L>Here Monckton stood; there Townshend rang'd himself;</L>
<L>And here, great Wolfe, in noble strength of soul,</L>
<L>Array'd the battle, and the men in arms.</L>
<L>O mighty Wolfe, if yet, thy warlike shade,</L>
<L>Revisitest these heights, and rocky streams,</L>
<L>Be witness here, in this unnatural strife,</L>
<L>Where a mad mother doth her children stab.</L>
<L>You, when you fought, did not unsheath your sword</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="015249_0030_0F9883BCB91EB228">
against your countrymen, and younger sons;</L>
<L>Did not excite, with cruel artifice,</L>

<L>Britannia then was free herself; her King,</L>

<L>Unhappy reign of an inhuman George!</L>
<L>I saw it early, and withdrew myself,</L>

<L>Surviv'd his victory, his native isle,</L>
<L>O'er-run with parasites, that drink the looks</L>
<L>Of flatter'd Majesty, and base-born Lords,</L>
<L>Would have disgusted him. This western land,</L>

<L>The budding orchard, and the oak-tree grove,</L>

<L>If Wolfe had liv'd, would he have drawn his sword,</L>

<L>O no, his soul, by Nature elegant,</L>

In this, however, I am clear, that at least once or twice in his life, he has discovered in his language, some degree of venom and malignity. His speech, in this place, is little more than a bare translation of his most famous proclamation, and his answer to the letter of the Congress ad|dressed to him, concerning his treatment of the prisoners in Canada. We can easily remember the good-natured epithets bestowed upon us in those very extraordinary compositions. Rebels, traitors, plunderers, murderers, paricides, lawless, faithless, perjured, base, ungrateful, bloody-minded men, were the smooth terms he made use of. The Con|gress, in his opinion, were a contemptible set of men, with whom no exchange of prisoners was to be made, from whom no flag was to be received. Nay every letter of theirs, or writing of any kind, was to be rejected with disdain, or burned by the hands of the common hangman.</P></NOTE> The noise shall cease, and their own cries be heard.</L>

But I find my conscience pretty much at ease in this matter, when I give my memory time to recollect the inhumanity of the officers and soldiers under his command to our prisoners, from the moment our affairs began to be on the decline in Canada. While the issue of the siege was yet doubtful, he affected to speak with great mo|deration, and, as some have told us, buried with the honours of war the corpse of Montgomery. As soon, however, as fortune began to shine fully out upon him, he grew warm in her rays, and like the viper in the sum|mer, drew unusual poison from the more than usual heat, until his spirit in its every thought and purpose became virulent, and like the nature of a Devil, capable of feeding on the misery of mankind. I have conversed with those who saw the scalps warm from the heads of our countrymen. I have had the relation from their mouths who beheld the fires lighted up, and heard, with a soul paining sympathy, the horrid shrieks and gloomy howlings of the Savage tribes in the execution of the poor cap|tives, who according to the threat of Carleton, were burned on an island in the river St. Lawrence, after our unfortunate surrender at the Cedars.</NOTE> If we prevail, and drive them from the walls.

<L>The school of freedom, learning's awful seat,</L>
<L>Where WITHERSPOON with every virtue fraught,</L>
<L>The generous youth his sacred precepts taught,</L>
<L>The sage's wisdom, and the patriot's fire,</L>
<L>A noble love of liberty inspire.</L>
<L>"Here early try'd, and acting but too well,</L>
<L>"The brave, lamented, much-lov'd FLEMING fell.</L>
<L>With gayest hopes of happiness possest,</L>
<L>With every smile of flattering fortune blest,</L>
<L>"Just as the spring of life began to bloom,</L>
<L>"And manly virtues sadder make the tomb,</L>
<L>"In all that health and energy of youth,</L>
<L>"Which promis'd honors of maturer growth,</L>
<L>"When his full heart expanded to the goal,</L>
<L>"And promis'd victory had flush'd his soul.</L>
<L>&mdash;He fell&mdash;his country lost her earliest boast,</L>
<L>"His lovely sisters, a fond brother lost.</L>
<L>O ever honour'd, ever happy shade,</L>
<L>How well hast thou thy debt to virtue paid.</L>
<L>Go happy ghost to where the good and blest</L>
<L>Enjoy eternal scenes of bliss and rest;</L>
<L>While we below thy sudden farewell mourn,</L>
<L>Collect thy virtues weeping o'er thy urn;</L>
<L>Recall their scatter'd lustre as they past,</L>
<L>And see them all united in the last.</L>

<BYLINE>By the AUTHOR of the Tragedy on the Death of General MONTGOMERY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>MUSE of elegy and tears,</L>
<L>Weeping o'er the buried years,</L>
<L>Where the virtuous lowly laid,</L>
<L>Shew the ruins death has made,</L>
<L>In soft language give relief,</L>
<L>To the swelling tides of grief,</L>
<L>That for thee shall ever flow,</L>
<L>Gentle spouse of Roberdeau.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heroes on the bleeding soil,</L>
<L>Hear of female worth a while;</L>
<L>Let me plant a softer name,</L>
<L>With your everlasting fame.</L>
<L>Once I saw her&mdash;she was fair,</L>
<L>Queenly in her shape and air;</L>
<L>Winning graces stole my love,</L>
<L>To admire her and approve;</L>
<L>While my grateful thoughts did rise</L>
<L>To the <HI>enthroned</HI> of the skies,</L>
<L>Who so bounteously gave birth,</L>
<L>To such excellence on earth.</L>

<L>She was charming as young light</L>
<L>On the sable skirts of night;</L>
<L>For her goodness serv'd to shew,</L>
<L>What sometimes we cease to know,</L>
<L>That true merit yet may rest,</L>
<L>In a handsome woman's breast;</L>
<L>And the body lovely made,</L>
<L>With like mind be jewelled:</L>
<L>Now the character is great,</L>
<L>Virtue, in fair beauty, set.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Every thought of her's was love,</L>
<L>With the beams of truth inwove;</L>
<L>Good nature, calm, and placid still,</L>
<L>In her smile was visible;</L>
<L>While the noble majesty</L>
<L>Of her countenance, and eye,</L>
<L>Gave her where she came soft sway,</L>
<L>And bade who did behold, obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Heaven to her did gifts dispense,</L>
<L>In rich store of native sense;</L>
<L>Education, to the height,</L>
<L>Polished and made them bright;</L>
<L>But religion's warmest soul</L>
<L>Pour'd new splendours on the whole.</L>

<L>Who have served God below.</L>

<L>Fondest husband, cease to mourn,</L>

<L>ON the white rocks which guard her coast,</L>

<L>Wide o'er the wat'ry waste</L>
