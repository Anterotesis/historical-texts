<P>THE Design of this Lottery is, to dispose of a Quantity of new and curious Goods, viz. A most elegant Collection of Pictures, in green and gold Frames, ditto in black and gold Frames, and a new and large Collection of Fancy Pieces, done by the greatest Masters in the World, both in and out of Frames, and a very fine Collection of Drawing Books, both coloured and uncoloured, with a large Collection of the newest Maps, in and out of Setts, as also in Books in the very best and finest Colours; Albion Birds, in the most beautiful Colours; a large Variety of Copper Plate Writings, by the ablest Penmen in England; also the Royal Amusement, which is now extremely fashionable, and is universally played instead of Back-Gammon, &amp;c. together with many other entertaining Curiosities, lately imported from London and elsewhere; Guns of the neatest Kind, single and double barrelled Pistols: and also a fine Assortment of Jewellery, among which are Diamonds, Garnets, Gold and Fancy Rings, with a Quantity of other Jewellery too tedious to mention, besides a great many other Goods, both useful and entertaining.</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, Adventurers in this Lottery, may depend that every Article will be rated at the lowest Prices the Proprietor sells them out of his Shop.</P>
<P>The Lots will be made out, nicely assorted, part Jewellery, Pictures, and other Curiosities, by four respectable Gentlemen, who will faithfully superintend the Drawing of this Lottery, and see that Justice is done to each Adventurer.</P>
<P>The Lots, composed of the before mentioned Goods, &amp;c. are to be made out to the full Amount of the Prizes, before the Lottery is drawn, except a small Deduction of Five per Cent. to defray the Charges.</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, if fortunate, may become possessed of a large and neat Assortment of Jewellery, Pictures, &amp;c. at the small Expence of Ten Shillings, to the Amount of One Hundred and Twenty Pounds, or other good Prizes, as per Scheme, which is perhaps better calculated for the Adven|turers, than any yet offered to the Public.</P>
<P>The Prizes are to be published immediately after Drawing, and paid as soon as published.</P>
<P>There is a great Number of Tickets already engaged, which gives the Proprietor Reason to believe the Drawing will soon commence. He hopes likewise, that those who incline to become Adventurers, will be speedy in applying for Tickets.</P>
<P>The Public may be informed where Tickets are to be had, by applying to the Bar-keeper of the London Coffee-House, and to Mr NICHOLAS BROOKS, near the Coffee-House, in Market-street, Mr. ALEXANDER POWER, near South-street, near the Wharf, Mr. JAMES SUTTER, near the Draw-bridge, opposite to Mr. John Mease, Merchant, Mr. EDWARD BATCHELOR, Merchant, in Second-street, Mr. THOMAS BAR|TOW, Merchant, Mr. JOHN PATTON, Merchant, in Water-street, Messrs. BUDDEN and STRAKER, at their Store in Front-street, and Mr. WILLIAM DIBLEY, Western Post.</P>
