<P>Their Government was purely <HI>Monarchical<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and as for such whose dominions extended further than would well admit the Princes per|sonal guidance, it was committed into the hands of <HI>Lieutenants,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></NOTE> who Governed with no less abso|luteness, than the Prince himself: notwithstand|ing in matters of difficulty, the <HI>Prince</HI> Consulted with his Nobles, and such whom he esteemed for Wisdom; in which it was admirable to see the Majestick deportment of the Prince, his Speech to his Council, with the most deliberate dis|cussion of any matter proposed for their advice; after which what was by him resolved, with|out the least hesitation was applauded, and with at lest a seeming Alacrity attended.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crown</HI> (if I may so term it) alwayes descended to the <HI>Eldest Son</HI> (though Subject to

<P>Their <HI>Nobles</HI> were either such who descended from the Blood Royal, or such on whom the Prince bestowed part of his do|minions with the <HI>Royalties,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobles.</HI></NOTE> or such whose descent was from Ancestors, who had time out of mind been Esteemed such.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Yeomen</HI> were such who having no stamp of <HI>Gentility,</HI> were yet esteemed as having a natural right of living within their Princes dominion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></NOTE> and a Common use of the <HI>Land,</HI> and were distinguished by two Names or Titles, the one signifying <HI>Subjection,</HI> the other, <HI>Tiller of the Land.</HI></P>
<P>Although this People retained nothing of <HI>Record,</HI> nor use of <HI>Letters,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Villians.</HI></NOTE> yet there lived among them many Fa|milies,

<HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> being Peopled with English; the Prince desiring something wherein the Eng|lish were concerned, Mr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> promising to effect what he desired; immediately Subjoyned, that he must <HI>First speak with the Inhabitants:</HI> the Prince demanded why he recalled his Promise; for said he, <HI>What I Promise or Speak it alwayes true, but you English Governours, cannot be true, for you can't make your words nor intentions true; but mine are alwayes true, for I make them true;</HI> greatly disdaining the <HI>Popular Government</HI> of the English in this Country.</P>
<P>Having Promised an account of the <HI>Conversion</HI> of many <HI>Indians</HI> Inhabiting these parts of <HI>America,</HI> it may well be Expected I should say something of their <HI>Religion,</HI> while <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>They generally acknowledged and worship|ped <HI>Many gods;</HI> therefore greatly esteemed and reverenced their <HI>Priests, Powaws</HI> or <HI>Wizards,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Religion</HI></NOTE> who were esteemed as having immediate converse with the <HI>gods:</HI> to them therefore they addressed them|selves in all difficult cases: yet could not all that desire that <HI>dignity</HI> (as they esteemed it) obtain <HI>Familiarity</HI> with the Infernal Spirits; nor were all <HI>Pawaw's</HI> alike Successfull in their ad|dresses: but they become such either by <HI>im|mediate Revelation,</HI> or in the use of certain <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> Tradition had left as means con|ducing to that end: insomuch that Parents

often out of certain Zeal dedicated their Children to the <HI>gods,</HI> and Educated them ac|cordingly, observing certain <HI>Diet,</HI> debarring <HI>Sleep &amp;c.</HI> yet of the many thus designed, but few obtained their desire.</P>
<P>Supposing that where the Practice of <HI>Witch|craft</HI> has been highly esteemed, there may be given the plainest demonstration, of Mortals having Familiarity with <HI>Infernal Spirits;</HI> I am willing to let my Reader know that not many years since, dyed here one of the <HI>Powaw's,</HI> who never pretended to <HI>Astrological knowledge,</HI> yet could precisely inform such who desire his Assistance, from whence <HI>Goods Stolen</HI> from them were taken, and whither carryed; with many, things of the like nature: nor was he ever known to indeavour the concealing, his knowledge, to be immediately from <HI>a god Subservient to him, that the English worshipped.</HI> This <HI>Powaw</HI> being by an English man, worthy of Credit (who late|ly informed me of the same) desired to ad|vise him, who had Stolen certain Goods which he had lost, having formerly been an eye wit|ness of his ability; the <HI>Powaw</HI> after a little pausing, demanded why he requested that from him, since himself served another God, that therefore he could not help him; but added, <HI>If you can believe that my god will help you, I will try what I can do;</HI> which diverted the man from further inqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y. I must a little digress, and tell my Reader that this <HI>Powaws</HI>

wife was accounted a Godly Woman, and lived in the practise and profession of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> not only by the approbation, but in|couragement of her Husband; She constantly <HI>Prayed</HI> in the Family, and attended the <HI>Publick Worship</HI> on the Lords Day's: he declared that he could not blame her, for that she Served a God that was above <HI>his;</HI> but that as to himself, his gods continued kindness, ob|liged him not to forsake his Service.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Powaw's</HI> by the Infernal Spirits often <HI>killed</HI> Persons, caused <HI>Lameness</HI> and <HI>Impo|tency,</HI> as well as shewed their Art in perform|ing things, beyond <HI>Humane,</HI> by <HI>Diabolick</HI> Skill, such who have conversed much among them have had no reason to question.</P>
<P>Their Practice was, either by desiring the <HI>Spirit</HI> to them appearing to perform, what mis|chief they intended; or to form a piece of <HI>Leather</HI> like an <HI>Arrow head,</HI> tying an hair there|to: or using some <HI>Bone,</HI> as of <HI>Fish</HI> (that it might be known Witchcraft, to the bewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ched) over which they performed certain <HI>Ceremonies;</HI> and dismissed them to Effect their desire.

<P><PB N="15" REF="000701_0014_0FA9A68B71DB7550">
The other I shall instance in, was a Rela|tion from Capt. <HI>Thomas Dagget</HI> <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> now de|ceased, and <HI>Richard Sarson</HI> <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> Justices of the Peace; who being on an Island, where a Bewitched Woman lay in great Extremity and wholly impotent: the <HI>Powaw's</HI> there having without Success indeavoured the Cure; the re|lated sent to <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> for more famoused <HI>Powaw's:</HI> the said Gentlemen, were admitted to be present, on certain conditions; the <HI>Pow|aw's,</HI> goe to dancing; who with the Specta|tors, used certain <HI>Ceremonies</HI> usual in such cases; one of the <HI>Powaw's</HI> Praying to his god, with such ardent desires and fervency, that Capt. <HI>Dagget</HI> told me, had it been to the true God, it had been a Prayer Ex|ceeding most that he had heard: the issue was, they in a <HI>Deer Skin</HI> caught the <HI>Spirit</HI> (as they said) which entered the Woman; this they said was the <HI>Spirit</HI> of an <HI>Englishman</HI> drowned in the Adjacent Sound: yet it was then supposed, the <HI>Powaw</HI> was by, which bewitched her: the issue was, she immediately reco|vered: the <HI>Powaw</HI> told her, <HI>unless she removed to</HI> Martha's Vineyard, <HI>she would again be Sick, for being an English Spirit be could not long confine it.</HI></P>

<P>During the late unhappy War between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> about Nineteen years since; an <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> porfessed too many of our <HI>English,</HI> whereby they suffered themselves to be unreasonably exasperated a|gainst all <HI>Indians;</HI> of such there were some on these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, who could hardly be so moderated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> and others in Go|vernment with him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be restrained from rising to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ming of the Indians; for whose satisfaction Capt. <HI>Richard Sarson</HI> <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> was ordered with a small party (the Indians being on these Islands Twenty to one, having

Mr.<HI>Thomas T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pper</HI> also has given an Ac|count of <HI>One hundred &amp; Eighty Indians,</HI> unto whom he do's dispense the word, concerning whom he ha's Charitable hopes that they do (and that with Zeal and Sincerity) Embrace the Gospel. There are moreover, in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony about <HI>Five Hundred Indians,</HI> amongst whom Mr. <HI>John Cotton</HI> (Pastor of the Church in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and Son to the Famous <HI>Cotton</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI>) hath and doth Preach the Gospel. Likewise Mr.<HI>Peter Thatcher,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Milton,</HI> is a Faithful Labourer amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Punkepaog.</HI> So is Mr.<HI>Grindal Rawson,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Mendam,</HI> among the <HI>Indians</HI> in those Parts; and Mr.<HI>Bondet,</HI> who is Minister to the French Congregation at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the <HI>Nipmug</HI> Country. The <HI>Indian</HI> Church at <HI>Natick</HI> (which was the first <HI>Indian</HI> Church in <HI>America</HI>) is since Blessed <HI>ELIOTS</HI> Death, much diminished and dwindled away. But Mr. <HI>Daniel Gookin,</HI> hath bestow'd his Pious Cares upon it.</P>
<P>Besides the Labours of the English in <HI>New|England,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dellius</HI> (a worthy <HI>Dutch</HI> Minister) at <HI>Albany</HI> has Learned the Language of the <HI>In|dians</HI> in those parts; God has Graciously Smil|led on his Endeavours, so as that Considerable Numbers of them are Converted to the Faith of Christ, and there is reason to hope that what

<P>I have this to add to my former, that a <HI>Jesuit</HI> called <HI>Milet,</HI> whom the <HI>Oneydes</HI> took Prisoner about four years agoe, and who is now in that Castle a great man among them, uses all his Subtilty to frustrate my Labours, by making false Impressions upon the <HI>Indians</HI> con|cerning our Religion; yet God Almighty is Pleased to strenghen my Proselytes in that way, I teach them more and more; some|times there happens difference and disputes between my Proselytes and his concerning the the Points of Religion, but ours alleadge they Confute the others. This I must say for them, that they take a great deal of Pains and are very Zealous to learn, and very Devote in there Practice; I am under favour of opini|on, that the <HI>Jesuit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> with the Cases of Conscience added thereto, writ by their own hands, which they learn the <HI>Indians,</HI> which is either in your or your Reverend Son, Mr. <HI>Cotton Mathers</HI> Possession&punc; may be Servi|ceable, to convince our Proselytes and others
