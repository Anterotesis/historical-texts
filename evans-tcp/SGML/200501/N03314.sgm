<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN my Contemplations of the DIVINE PROVIDENCE towards the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> I have often tho't what a special Favour it was, that there came over with the first Settlers of <HI>Plimouth &amp; Connecticut Colonies,</HI> which in those Times were especially exposed to the superior Power of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> round a|bout them; <HI>Two brave Englishmen</HI> bred to Arms in the <HI>Dutch Nether|lands,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Capt. MILES STANDISH of <HI>Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">outh,</HI> and Capt JOHN MASON of <HI>Connecticut:</HI> Gentlemen of tried Valour, Military Skill and Conduct, great Activity, and warm Zeal for that noble Cause of <HI>Pure Scriptural Religion,</HI> and <HI>Religious Liberty,</HI> which were the chief original Design and Interest of <HI>the Fathers of these Plantations;</HI> and who were acted with such eminent Degrees of Faith and Piety, as excited them to the most daring Ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rprizes in the Cause of GOD and of <HI>his People,</HI>and went a great way to their wonderful Successes.</P>
<P>Like those inspired <HI>Heroes</HI> of whom we read the History in the <HI>Eleventh</HI> Chapter to the HE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">REWS&mdash;<HI>By Faith,</HI> they not only <HI>rather chose to suffer Affliction with the People of</HI> GOD <HI>than to enjoy the Plea|sures of Sin for a Season; esteeming the Reproach of</HI> CHRIST <HI>greater Riches than the Treas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Egypt:</HI> But <HI>by Faith</HI> they even <HI>fors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me, <HI>passed thro' the Sea, subdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteousness, obtained Promises, waxed valiant in Fight, and turned to Flight the Ar|mies of the Aliens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="004033_0004_1003CE2273BFC1C8">The Judicious Reader that knows the <HI>New English</HI> History, can|no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> think these <HI>Scripture Phrases</HI> or religious Turns unsuitable on this Occasion: For as <HI>these Colonies</HI> were chiefly, if not entirely Settled by a <HI>Religious People,</HI> and for <HI>those Religious Purposes;</HI> It is as impossi|ble to write an impartial or true History of <HI>them,</HI> as of the ancient <HI>Israelites,</HI> or the later <HI>Vaudois</HI> or <HI>North-Britons,</HI> without observing that <HI>Religious Spirit and Intention</HI> which evidently run thro' and animate their Historical Transactions.</P>
<P>Capt. STANDISH was of a lower Stature, but of such a daring and active Genius, that even before the Arrival of the <HI>Massachusetts Colony,</HI>He spread a Terror over all the Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> round about him, from the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> to <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI>&amp; from<HI>Cape-CodHar|bour to Narragansett.</HI> Capt. MASON was Tall and Portly, but never the less full of Martial Bravery and Vigour; that He soon became the equal Dread of the more numerous Nations from <HI>Narragansett</HI> to <HI>Hudson's River.</HI> They were BOTH the Instrumental Saviours of this Country in the most critical Conjunctures: And as we quietly enjoy the Fruits of their extraordinary Diligence and Valour, both the present and future Generations will for ever be obliged to revere their Memory.</P>
<P>Capt. MASON, the Writer of the following History, in which He was a principal Actor, as Chief Commander of the <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces, is said to have been a Relative of Mr. <HI>John Mason</HI> the ancient <HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|mer</HI> of the <HI>Province of New-Hampshire:</HI> However, the <HI>Captain</HI> was one of the first who went up from the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> about the Year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5 to lay the Foundation of CONNECTICUT COLONY: He went from <HI>Dorchester,</HI> first settled at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and thence marched forth to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Pequot War.</HI></P>
<P>But it being above <HI>Threescore Years</HI> since the following Narrative was Written, near <HI>an Hundred</HI> since the Events therein related, and the State of the <HI>New England Colonies</HI> being long since greatly Chang|ed; it seems needful for the present Readers clearer Apprehension of these Matters, to Observe&mdash;That in the Year 1633,&amp; 1634, several <HI>Englishmen</HI> arriving from <HI>England,</HI> at the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> went up in the Western Country to discover <HI>Connecticut River;</HI> the <HI>next Year</HI> began to remove thither: and by the Beginning of 1637, <HI>Hartford, Windsor</HI> and <HI>Weathersfield</HI> were Settled, besides a <HI>Fortification</HI> built at <HI>Saybrook</HI> on the Mouth of the River.</P>
<P>At that Time there were especially <HI>three</HI> powerful and warlike <HI>Nations</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>South Western</HI> Parts of <HI>New-England;</HI> which
<PB N="iv" REF="004033_0005_1003CDCCC7F68F18">
spread all the Country from <HI>Aqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thneck,</HI> since call'd <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI>to <HI>Quinnepiack,</HI> since called <HI>New-H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ven;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the NARRAGANSETTS, PEQUOTS and MOHEGANS. The NARRAGANSETTS reached from the Bay of the same Name, to <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">catuck River,</HI> now the Boundary between the Governments of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>Connecti|cut:</HI> And their Head Sachem was MIANTONIMO. The PEQUOTS reached from thence Westward to <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> and over it, as far as <HI>Branford,</HI> if not <HI>Quinnepiack;</HI> their Head Sachem being SASSACUS. And the MOHEGANS spread along from the <HI>Narra|gansetts</HI> thro' the Inland Country, on the Back or Northerly Side of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> between <HI>them</HI> and the <HI>Nipmucks;</HI> their Head Sachem being UNCAS.</P>
<P>The most terrible of all those Nations were then the PEQUOTS; who with their <HI>depending Tribes</HI> soon entered on a Resolution to De|stroy the <HI>English</HI> out of the Country. In 1634, they killed Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> and all his Company, being <HI>seven</HI> besides Himself, in &amp; near his Bark on <HI>Connecticut River.</HI> In 1635, they killed Capt. <HI>Oldham</HI> in his Bark at <HI>Block-Island;</HI> and at <HI>Long-Island</HI> they killed <HI>two</HI> more cast away there. In 1636, and the following <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> they killed <HI>six</HI> &amp; took <HI>seven</HI> more at <HI>Connecticut River:</HI> Those they took alive they tortured to Death in a most barbarous Manner. And on <HI>April</HI> 23. 1637, they killed <HI>nine</HI> more and carried <HI>two</HI> young Wo|men Captive at <HI>Weathersfield.</HI></P>
<P>They had earnestly solicited the <HI>Narragansetts</HI> to engage in their Confederacy: very politickly representing to them, <HI>That if they shou'd help or suffer the</HI> English <HI>to subdue the</HI> Pequots, <HI>they wou'd thereby make Way for their own future Ruin; and that they need not come to open Battle with the</HI> English; <HI>only Fire our Houses, kill our Cattle,lye in Ambush and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t us as we went about our Business; so we should be quickly forced to leave this Country, and the</HI> Indians <HI>not exposed to any great Hazard.</HI> Those truly politick Arguments were upon the Point of prevailing on the <HI>Narragansetts:</HI> And had <HI>These</HI> with the <HI>Mohegans,</HI> to whom the <HI>Pequots</HI> were nearly related, join'd against us; they might <HI>then,</HI> in the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant State of these Colonies, have easily accomplished their desparate Resolutions.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Narragansetts</HI> being more afraid of the <HI>Pequots</HI> than of the <HI>English;</HI> were willing they shou'd weaken each other, not in the least imagining the <HI>English</HI> cou'd destroy <HI>them;</HI> at the same time an <HI>Agency</HI> from the <HI>Massachusetts Colony</HI> to the <HI>Narragansetts,</HI> happily Preserved their staggering Friendship. And as UNCAS the Great Sachim of the <HI>Moheags,</HI> upon the first coming of the <HI>English,</HI> fell
<PB N="v" REF="004033_0006_1003CE240FBF3060">
into an intimate Acquaintance with Capt. <HI>Mason,</HI> He from the Be|ginn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">g entertained us in an amicable Manner: And tho' both by <HI>his Father and Mother</HI> He derived from the <HI>Royal Blood</HI> of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and had Married the <HI>Daughter</HI> of TATOBAM their then late Sachim; yet such was his Affection for us, as he faithfully adhered to us, ventured his Life in our Service, assisted at the Taking their <HI>Fort,</HI> when about <HI>Seven Hundred</HI> of them were Destroyed, and thereupon in subduing and driving out of the Country the remaining greater Part of that fierce and dangerous Nation.</P>
<P>Soon after the War, Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> was by the Government of <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> made the <HI>Major General</HI> of all their Forces, and so continu|ed to the Day of his Death: The Rev. Mr. HOOKER of <HI>Hartford,</HI> being desired by the Government in their Name to deliver <HI>the Staff</HI> into his Hand; We may imagin he did it with that superiour Piety, Spirit and Majesty, which were peculiar to him: Like an ancient Prophet addressing himself to the Military Officer, delivering to him the Principal Ensign of Martial Power, to Lead the Armies &amp; Fight the Battles of the LORD and of <HI>his People.</HI></P>
<P>Major <HI>Mason</HI> having been trained up in the <HI>Netherland War</HI> under Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX; when the Struggle arose in <HI>England</HI> between K. <HI>Charles</HI> I and the <HI>Parliament</HI> about the Royal Powers and the National Liberties; <HI>that Famous General</HI> had such an Esteem for the <HI>Major's</HI> Conduct and Bravery, that <HI>He</HI> wrote to the <HI>Major</HI> to come over and help <HI>Him.</HI> But the <HI>Major</HI> excusing himself, continued in this Country as long as he lived, and had some of the greatest Honours his <HI>Colony</HI> cou'd yield him.</P>
<P>For besides his Office of <HI>Major General,</HI> the Colony in <HI>May</HI> 1660 chose him their DEPUTY GOVERNOUR; continued him in the same Post by annual Re-elections, by virtue of their first Constitution to 1662 inclusively. The <HI>same Year</HI> K. CHARLES II. comprehending the <HI>Colonies</HI> of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New Haven</HI> in <HI>One Government</HI> by the Name of CONNECTICUT COLONY; He in the <HI>Royal Charter,</HI> signed <HI>April</HI> 23, appointed Major <HI>Mason</HI> their first <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> till the <HI>second Thursday</HI> of <HI>October</HI> following: After which, the <HI>General Court</HI> being left to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e their Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, they continued to chuse him their <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> every Year to <HI>May</HI> 1670; when his Age and Bodily Infirmities advancing, he laid down his Office and retired from Publick Business.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Pequot War,</HI> he had removed from <HI>Windsor</HI> to <HI>Saybrook:</HI> But in 1659, he removed thence to <HI>Norwich;</HI> where he <HI>Died</HI> in 1672,
<PB N="vi" REF="004033_0007_1003CDCE5096AC70">
or 1673, in the 73d Year of his Age: leaving <HI>three Sons,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Samuel, John</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> to imitate their Father's Example and inherit his Virtues.</P>
<P>I have only now to observe, that in <HI>The Relation of the Troubles which happened to</HI> New England <HI>by the</HI> Indians <HI>from</HI> 1614 <HI>to</HI> 1675, Published by the then Mr. INCREASE MATHER in 1677, I find a <HI>Copy</HI> of the <HI>following Narrative,</HI> but without the Prefaces, had been communicated to him by Mr. <HI>John Allyn</HI> then the <HI>Secretary</HI> of <HI>Con|necticut Colony;</HI> which that Rev. Author took for Mr. <HI>Allyn's,</HI> and calls it <HI>his.</HI> But we must inform the Reader, that <HI>the Narrative</HI> was originally drawn by Major <HI>Mason.</HI> And as <HI>his Eldest Grandson</HI> Capt. <HI>John Mason</HI> now of <HI>New-London</HI> has put it into my Hands; I have been more than usually careful in Correcting the Press according to the <HI>Original;</HI> as <HI>the most authentick Account</HI> of the <HI>Pequot War,</HI> and as a <HI>standing Monument</HI> both of the extraordinary Dangers &amp; Cour|age of our pious <HI>Fathers</HI> &amp; of the eminent Appearance of HEAVEN to save them.</P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">The <HI>other Actions</HI> of Major <HI>Mason</HI> must be referred to the <HI>General History</HI> of <HI>this Country,</HI> when some Gentleman of greater Qualifica|tions and Leisure than I may claim, shall rise up among us, to undertake it.

<HEAD>SOME Grounds of the War Against the Pequots.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the Year 1632 one Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> Arrived in the <HI>Massachusett</HI> in a <HI>Ship</HI> from <HI>Virginia;</HI> who shortly after was bound for <HI>Virginia</HI> a|gain in a small <HI>Bark</HI> with one Capt. <HI>Norton;</HI> who sailing into CONNECTICUT RIVER a|bout <HI>two Leagues</HI> from the <HI>Entrance</HI> cast An|chor; there coming to them several <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to that Place whom the <HI>Pequots</HI> Tyrannized over, being a potent and warlike People, it being their Custom so to deal with their neighbour Indians; Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> hav|ing some occasion with the <HI>Dutch</HI> who lived at a trading House near <HI>twenty Leagues</HI> up the River, procured some of those <HI>Indians</HI> to go as Pilots with <HI>two</HI> of his Men to the <HI>Dutch:</HI> But being benighted before they could come to their desired Port, put the <HI>Skiff</HI> in which they went, ashore, where the <HI>two Englishmen</HI> falling asleep, were both Murdered by their <HI>Indian</HI> Guide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: There re|maining with the <HI>Bark</HI> about <HI>twelve</HI> of the aforesaid <HI>Indians;</HI> who had in all probability formerly plotted their bloody Design; and waiting an opportunity when some of the <HI>English</HI> were on

Shoar and Capt&punc; <HI>Stone</HI> asleep in his Cabbin, set upon them and cruelly Murdered every one of them, plundered what they pleased and sunk the Bark.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> were not <HI>native Pequots,</HI> but had frequent recourse unto them, to whom they tendered some of those Goods, which were accepted by the <HI>Chief Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Pequots:</HI> Other of the said Goods were tendered to NYNIGRETT <HI>Sachem</HI> of <HI>Nayanticke,</HI> who also received them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> being informed of their Pro|ceedings, sent to speak with the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and had some Treaties with them. But being unsatisfied therewith, sent forth Captain <HI>John Endicot</HI> Commander in Chief, with Capt. <HI>Underhill,</HI> Captain <HI>Turner,</HI> and with them <HI>one hundred and twenty Men;</HI> who were firstly designed on a Service against a People living on <HI>Block Island,</HI> who were subject to the <HI>Narragansett Sachem;</HI> they having taken a <HI>Bark</HI> of one Mr. <HI>John Oldham,</HI> Murdering him and all his Company: They were also to call the <HI>Pequots</HI> to an Account about the Murder of Capt. <HI>Stone;</HI> who arriving at <HI>Pequot</HI> had some Conference with them; but little effected; only one <HI>Indian</HI> slain and some <HI>Wigwams</HI> burnt. After which, the <HI>Pequots</HI> grew inraged against the <HI>English</HI> who inhabited CONECTICOT, being but a small Number, about <HI>two hundred and fifty,</HI> who were there newly arrived; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as also about <HI>twenty Men</HI> at SAYBROOK, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Lyon Gardner,</HI> who was there settled by several Lords and Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Pequots</HI> falling violently upon them, slew diverse Men at <HI>Saybrook;</HI> keeping al|most a constant Siege upon the Place; so that the <HI>English</HI> were constrained to keep within their pallizado <HI>Fort;</HI> being so hard Beset and sometimes Assaulted, that Capt. <HI>John Mason</HI> was sent by <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> with <HI>twenty Men</HI> out of their small Numbers to secure the Place: But after his coming, there did not one <HI>Pequot</HI> appear in view for one <HI>Month</HI> Space, which was the time he there remained.</P>
<P>In the Interim certain <HI>Pequots</HI> about <HI>One Hundred</HI> going to a Place called <HI>Weathersfield</HI> on <HI>Connecticut;</HI> having formerly con|federated with the <HI>Indians</HI> of that Place (as it was generally thought) lay in Ambush for the <HI>English;</HI> divers of them go|ing into a large Field adjoyning to the Town to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">abour, were there set upon by the <HI>Indians: Nine</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> were

<P>At their Return from <HI>Weathersfield,</HI> they came down the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Connecticut</HI> (Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> being then at <HI>Saybrook Fort</HI>) in <HI>three Canoes</HI> with about <HI>one hundred Men,</HI> which River of necessity they must pass: We espying them, concluded they had been acting some Mischief against us, made a Shot at them with a Piece of Ordnance, which beat off the Beak Head of one of their <HI>Canoes,</HI> wherein our <HI>two Captives</HI> were: it was at a very great distance: They then hastened, drew their <HI>Canoes</HI> over a narrow Beach with all speed and so got away.</P>

<HI>Skiff:</HI> Capt. <HI>John Underhill</HI> also coming with him, who informed us what was performed by <HI>Onkos</HI> and his Men; which we looked at as a special Providence; for before we were some what doubtful of his Fidelity: Capt. <HI>Underhill</HI> then offered his Service with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inteen</HI> Men to go with us, if Lieutenant <HI>Gardner</HI> would allow of it, who was Chief Commander at <HI>Saybrook Fort;</HI> which was readily approved of by Lieutenant <HI>Gardner</HI> and accepted by us: In lieu of them we sent back <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wenty</HI> of our Soldiers to <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>Upon <HI>a Wednesday</HI> we arrived at <HI>Saybrook,</HI> where we lay Windbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d until <HI>Friday;</HI> often consulting how and in what manner we should proceed in our Enterprize, being altogether ignorant of the Country. At length we concluded GOD assisting us, for <HI>Narragansett,</HI> and so to March through their Country, which Bordered upon the <HI>Enemy;</HI> where lived a great People, it being about <HI>fifteen Leagues</HI> beyond <HI>Pequot:</HI> The <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Reasons</HI> of our so Acting you shall presently understand:</P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">First, <HI>The Pequots our Enemies, kept a continual Guard upon the River Night and Day.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">Secondly, <HI>Their Numbers far exceeded ours; having</HI> sixteen Guns <HI>with Powder and Shot, as we were inform|ed by the</HI> two <HI>Captives foremention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d (where we declared the Grounds of this War) who were taken by the</HI> Dutch <HI>and restored to us at</HI> Saybrook; <HI>which indeed was a very friendly Office and not to be forgotton.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">Thirdly, <HI>They were on Land, and being swift on Foot, might much impede our Landing and possibly dis|hearten our Men; we being expected only by Land, there being no other Place to go on Shoar but in that River, nearer than</HI> Narragansett</HI></P>
<P><HI REND="margQuotes">Fourthly, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Narragansett <HI>we should come upon their Backs and possibly might surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them unaware, at worst we should be on firm Land as well as they.</HI></HI> All which
<PB N="3" REF="004033_0020_1003B28FF9F56ED0">
proved very successful as the Sequel may evidently de|monstrate.</P>
<P>But yet for all this, <HI>our Counsel</HI> all of them except the <HI>Captain</HI> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e at a stand, and could not judge it meet to sail to <HI>Narragansett:</HI> And indeed there was a very strong Ground for it; our Commission limiting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to land our Men in <HI>Pequot River;</HI> we had also the same Order by a Letter of Instruction sent us to <HI>Saybrook.</HI></P>
<P>But Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> apprehending an exceeding great Hazard in so doing, for the Reasons fore mentioned, as also some other which I shall forbear to trouble you with, did therefore earnestly desire Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> that he would commend our Condition to the LORD, <HI>that Night,</HI>to direct how in what manner we should demean our selves in that Respect; He being our <HI>Chaplin</HI> and lying aboard our <HI>Pink,</HI> the Captain on shoar. In the <HI>Morning</HI> very early Mr. <HI>Stone</HI> came ashoar to the Captain's Chamber, and told him, he had done as he had desired, and was fully satisfied to sail for <HI>Narragansett.</HI> Our Council was then called, and the several Reasons alledged: In fine we all agreed with one accord to sail for <HI>Narragansett,</HI> which the <HI>next Morn|ing</HI> we put in Execution.</P>
<P>I declare not this to encourage any Soldiers to Act be|yond their Commission, or contrary to it; for in so doing they run a double Hazard. There was a great Com|mander in <HI>Belgia</HI> who did the <HI>States</HI> great Service in taking a City; but by going beyond his Commission lost his Life: His name was <HI>Grubb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nk.</HI> But if a War be Managed duly by Judgment and Discretion as is re|quisit, the Shews are many times contrary to what they seem to pursue: Wherefore the more an Enterprize is dissembled and kept secret, the more sacil to put in Exe|cution; as the Proverb, <HI>The farthest way about is sometimes the nearest way home.</HI> I shall make bold to present this as my present Thoughts in this Case; In Matters of War, those who are both able and faithful should be improved; and then bind them not up into too narrow a Compass:

For it is not possible for the wisest and ablest Senator to foresee all Accidents and Occurrents that fall out in the Management and Pursuit of a War: Nay although possibly he might be trained up in Military Affairs; and truly much less can he have any great Knowledge who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th had but little Experience therein. What shall I say? GOD led his People thro' many Difficulties and Turnings; yet by more than an ordinary Hand of Provi|dence he brought them to <HI>Canaan</HI> at last.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday Morning,</HI> we set Sail <HI>for</HI> NARRAGANSETT-BAY, and on <HI>Saturday</HI> towards <HI>Evening</HI> we arrived at our desired Port, there we kept the <HI>Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>Monday</HI> the Wind blew so hard at North-West that we could not go on Shoar; as also on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> until <HI>Sun set;</HI> at which time Capt. <HI>Mason</HI> landed and Marched up to the Place of the <HI>Chief Sachem's</HI> Residence; who told the SACHEM, <Q><HI>That we had not an opportunity to acquaint him with our coming Armed in his Country sooner; yet not doubting but it would be well accepted by him, there being Love betwixt himself and us; well knowing also that the</HI> Pequots <HI>and themselves were Ene|mies, and that he could not be un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">quainted with those intolerable Wrongs and Injuries these</HI> Pequots <HI>had lately done unto the</HI> English; <HI>and that we were now come,</HI> GOD <HI>assisting, to Avenge our selves upon them; and that we did only desire free Passage through his Country.</HI></Q> Who re|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ned us this ANSWER, <Q><HI>That he did accept of our coming, and did also approve of our Design; only he thought our Numbers were too weak to deal with the Enemy, who were</HI> (as he said) <HI>very great Captains and Men skilful in War.</HI></Q> Thus he spake somewhat slighting of us.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Wednesday Morning,</HI> we Marched from thence to a Place called NAYANTICK, it being about <HI>eighteen</HI> or <HI>twenty Miles</HI> distant, where another of those <HI>Narra|gan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ett Sachems</HI> lived in a <HI>Fort;</HI> it being a <HI>Frontier</HI> to the <HI>Pequots.</HI> They carryed very proudly towards us; not permitting any of us to come into their Fort.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004033_0022_1003CE44C0E5E778">We beholding their Carriage and the Falshood of <HI>In|dians,</HI> and fearing least they might discover us to the E|nemy, especially they having many times some of their near Relations among their greatest Foes; we therefore caused a strong Guard to be set about their <HI>Fort,</HI> giving Charge that no <HI>Indian</HI> should be suffered to pass in or out: We also informed the <HI>Indians,</HI> that none of them should stir out of the <HI>Fort</HI> upon peril of their Lives: so as they would not suffer any of us to come into their <HI>Fort,</HI> so we would not suffer any of them to go out of the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P>There we quartered <HI>that Night,</HI> the Indians not offer|ing to stir out all the while.</P>

<P>On the <HI>Thursday</HI> about <HI>eight of the Clock</HI> in the <HI>Morn|ing,</HI> we Marched thence <HI>towards</HI> PEQUOT, with about <HI>five hundred Indians:</HI> But through the Heat of the Wea|ther and want of Provisions, some of our Men Fainted: And having Marched about <HI>twelve Miles,</HI> we came to <HI>Pawcatuck-River,</HI> at a <HI>Ford</HI> where our <HI>Indians</HI> told us the <HI>Pequots</HI> did usually Fish; there making an <HI>Alta,</HI> we stayed some small time: The <HI>Narragansett Indians</HI> ma|nifesting great Fear, in so much that many of them re|turned, although they had frequently despised us, saying, <HI>That we durst not look upon a</HI> PEQUOT, <HI>but themselves would perform great Things;</HI> though we had often tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them <HI>that we came on purpose and were resolved,</HI> GOD <HI>assist|ing, to see the</HI> PEQUOTS, <HI>and to Fight with them before we

returned, though we perished.</HI> I then enquired of ONKOS, <HI>what he thought the Indians would do?</HI> Who said, <HI>The</HI> NARRAGANSETTS <HI>would all leave us, but as for</HI> HIM|SELF <HI>He would never leave us:</HI> and so it proved: For which Expressions and some other Speeches of his, I shall never forget him. Indeed he was a great Friend, and did great Service.</P>
<P>And after we had refreshed our selves with our mean Commons, we Marched about <HI>three Miles,</HI> and came to a <HI>Field</HI> which had lately been planted with <HI>Indian Corn:</HI> There we made another <HI>Alt,</HI> and called our Council, supposing we drew near to the Enemy: And being in|formed by the <HI>Indians</HI> that the Enemy had <HI>two Forts</HI> almost impregnable; but we were not at all Discouraged, but rather Animated, in so much that we were resolved to Assault both their Forts at once. But understanding that <HI>one of them</HI> was so remote that we could not come up with it before <HI>Midnight,</HI> though we Marched hard; where|at we were much grieved, chiefly because the greatest and bloodiest <HI>Sachem</HI> there resided, whose Name was SASSACOUS: We were then constrained, being exceed|ingly spent in our March with extream Heat and want of Necessaries, to accept of the <HI>nearest.</HI></P>
<P>We then Marching on in a silent Manner, the <HI>Indians</HI> that remained fell all into the <HI>Rear,</HI> who formerly kept the <HI>Van;</HI> (being possessed with great Fear) we continued our March till about <HI>one Hour in the Night:</HI> and coming to a <HI>little Swamp between two Hills,</HI> there we pitched our little Camp; much wearied with hard Travail, keeping great Silence, supposing we were very near the <HI>Fort</HI> as our <HI>Indians</HI> informed us; which proved otherwise: The Rocks were our Pillows; yet Rest was pleasant: The <HI>Night</HI> proved Comfortable, being clear and Moon Light: We appointed our Guards and placed our Sentinels at some distance; who heard the Enemy Singing at the <HI>Fort,</HI> who continued that Strain until Midnight, with great In|sulting and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">joycing, as we were afterwards informed: They seeing our <HI>Pinnaces</HI> sail by them some Days before,

<P>And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the ALMIGHTY let fall upon their Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very Flames, where many of them perish|ed.

<P>The Fire was kindled on the <HI>North East Side</HI> to wind|ward; which did swiftly over run the <HI>Fort,</HI> to the ex|tream Amazement of the Enemy, and great Rejoycing of our selves. Some of them climbing to the Top of the Palizado; others of them running into the very Flames; many of them gathering to windward, lay pelting at us with their Arrows; and we repayed them with our small Shot: Others of the Stoutest issued forth, as we did guess, to the Number of <HI>Forty,</HI> who perished by the Sword.</P>
<P>What I have formerly said, is according to my own Knowledge, there being sufficient living Testimony to every Particular.</P>
<P>But in reference to Captain <HI>Underhill</HI> and his Parties acting in this Assault, I can only intimate as we were informed by some of themselves immediately after the Fight, Thus <HI>They</HI> Marching up to the <HI>Entrance</HI> on the <HI>South West Side,</HI> there made some Pause; a valiant, reso|lute Gentleman, one Mr. HEDGE, stepping towards the <HI>Gate,</HI> saying, <HI>If we may not Enter, wherefore came we hear;</HI> and immediately end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avoured to Enter; but was opposed by a sturdy <HI>Indian</HI> which did impede his Entrance: but the <HI>Indian</HI> being slain by himself and Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">jeant <HI>Davis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hedge</HI> Entred the <HI>Fort</HI> with some others; but the <HI>Fort</HI> being on Fire, the Smoak and Flames were so violent that they were constrained to desert the <HI>Fort.</HI></P>
<P>Thus were they now at their Wits End, who not many Hours before exalted themselves in their great Pride, threatning and resolving the utter Ruin and Destruction of all the <HI>English,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">xulting and Rejoycing with Songs and Dances: But GOD was above them, who laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making them as a siery Oven: Thus were the Stout Hearted spoiled, having slept their last Sleep, and none of their

<P>And here we may see the just Judgment of GOD, in sending even the very <HI>Night before</HI> this Assault, <HI>One hundred and fifty Men</HI> from their other <HI>Fort,</HI> to join with them of that Place, who were designed as some of them|selves reported to go forth against the <HI>English,</HI> at that very Instant when this heavy Stroak came upon them, where they perished with their Fellows.

<P><HI>Thus</HI> did <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>scatter his Enemies with his strong A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m!</HI> The <HI>Pequots</HI> now became a Prey to all <HI>Indians.</HI> Happy were they that could bring in their Heads to the <HI>English:</HI> Of which there came almost daily to <HI>Winsor,</HI> or <HI>Hartford</HI> But the <HI>Pequots</HI> growing weary hereof, sent some of the Chief that survived to <HI>mediate</HI> with the <HI>En|glish;</HI> offering that <HI>If they might but enjoy their Lives, they would become the</HI> English <HI>Vassals, to dispose of them as they pleased.</HI> Which was granted them. Whereupon ONKOS and MYANTONIMO were sent for; who with the <HI>Pequots</HI> met at <HI>Hartford.</HI> The <HI>Pequots</HI> being demanded, <HI>How many of them were then living?</HI> Answered, about <HI>One Hundred and Eighty,</HI> or <HI>Two Hundred.</HI> There were then given to ONKOS, Sachem of MONHEAG, <HI>Eighty;</HI> to

The <HI>Pequots</HI> were then bound by COVENANT, <HI>That none should inhabit their native Country, nor should any of them be called</HI> PEQUOTS <HI>any more, but</HI> MOHEAGS <HI>and</HI> NARRA|GANSETTS <HI>for ever.</HI> Shortly after, about <HI>Forty</HI> of them went to <HI>Moheag;</HI> others went to <HI>Long Island;</HI> the rest settled at <HI>Pawcatuck,</HI> a Place in <HI>Pequot Country,</HI> con|trary to their late Covenant and Agreement with the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Which <HI>Connecticut</HI> taking into Consideration, and well weighing the several Inconveniences that might ensue; for the Prevention whereof, they sent out <HI>forty Men</HI> under the Command of Captain <HI>John Mason,</HI> to supplant them, by burning their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> and bringing away their Corn, except they would desert the Place: ONKOS with about <HI>One Hundred of his Men</HI> in <HI>twenty Canoes,</HI> going also to assist in the Service. As we sailed into <HI>Pawcatuck-Bay</HI> We met with <HI>three</HI> of those <HI>Indians,</HI> whom we sent to inform the rest with the end of our coming, and also that we desired to speak with some of them: They promised speedily to return us an Answer, but never came to us more.</P>
<P>We run our <HI>Vessel</HI> up into a <HI>small River,</HI> and by reason of Flatts were forced to land on the <HI>West Side;</HI> their <HI>Wig|wams</HI> being on the <HI>East</HI> just opposite, where we could see the <HI>Indians</HI> running up and down Jeering of us. But we meeting with a <HI>narrow Place</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> between <HI>two Rocks,</HI> drew up our <HI>Indians Canoes,</HI> and got suddenly over sooner than we were expected or desired; March|ing immediately up to their <HI>Wigwams;</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> being all fled, except some old People that could not.</P>
<P>We were so suddenly upon them that they had not time to convey away their Goods: We viewed their Corn,

whereof there was Plenty, it being their time of <HI>Har|vest:</HI> And coming down to the Water Side to our Pin|nace with <HI>half</HI> of ONKOS'<HI>S</HI> his <HI>Men,</HI> the rest being plundering the <HI>Wigwams;</HI> we looking towards a <HI>Hill</HI> not far remote, we e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pyed about <HI>sixty Indians</HI> running towards us; we supposing they were our absent Men, the <HI>Moheags</HI> that were with us not speaking one word, nor moving towards them until the other came within <HI>thirty</HI> or <HI>forty Paces</HI> of them; then they run and met them and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell on pell mell striking and cutting with Bows, Hatch|ets, Knives, &amp;c, after their feeble Manner: Indeed it did hardly deserve the Name of <HI>Fighting.</HI> We then endea|voured to get between them and the Woods, that so we might prevent their flying; which they perceiving, en|deavoured speedily to get off under the <HI>Beach:</HI> We made no Shot at them, nor any hostile Attempt upon them. Only <HI>seven</HI> of them who were NYNIGRETT'S <HI>Men,</HI> were taken. Some of them growing very outragi|ous, whom we intended to have made shorter by the Head; and being about to put it in Execution; one <HI>Otash</HI> a Sachem of <HI>Narragansett,</HI> Brother to MYANTO|NIMO stepping forth, told the <HI>Captain, They were his Bro|ther's Men, and that he was a Friend to the</HI> English, <HI>and if we would spare their Lives we should have as many Murtherers Heads in lieu of them which should be delivered to the</HI> English. We considering that there was no Blood shed as yet, and that it tended to Peace and Mercy, granted his Desire; and so delivered them to ONKOS to secure them until his Engagement was performed, because our <HI>Prison</HI> had been very much pestered with such Creatures.</P>
<P>We then drew our <HI>Bark</HI> into a <HI>Creek,</HI> the better to defend her; for there were <HI>many Hundreds</HI> within <HI>five Miles</HI> waiting upon us. There we Quartered <HI>that Night:</HI> In the <HI>Morning</HI> as soon as it was Light, there appeared in Arms at least <HI>Three Hundred Indians</HI> on the other Side the <HI>Creek:</HI> Upon which we stood to our Arms; which they perceiving, some of them fled, others crept behind the Rocks and Trees, not one of them to be seen. We then called to them, saying, <HI>We desired to speak with them,
<PB N="20" REF="004033_0037_1003CE1093F58710">
and that we would down our Arms for that end:</HI> Where|upon they stood up: We then informed them, <HI>That the Pequots had violated their Promise with the</HI> English, <HI>in that they were not there to inhabit, and that we were sent to supplant them:</HI> They answered saying, <HI>The</HI> Pequots <HI>were good Men, their Friends, and they would Fight for them, and protect them:</HI> At which we were some|what moved, and told them, <HI>It was not far to the Head of the</HI> Creek <HI>where we would meet them, and then they might try what they could do in that Respect.</HI></P>
<P>They then replyed, <HI>That they would not Fight with</HI> ENGLISH MEN, <HI>for they were</HI> SPIRITS, <HI>but would Fight with</HI> ONKOS. We replyed, <HI>That we thought it was too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arly for them to Fight, but they might take their oppor|tunity; we should be burning</HI> Wigwams, <HI>and carrying Corn aboard all that Day.</HI> And presently beating up our Drum, we Fired the <HI>Wigwams</HI> in their View: And as we March|ed, there were <HI>two Indians</HI> standing upon a <HI>Hill</HI> jeering and reviling of us: Mr. <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> our Interpreter, Marching at Liberty, desired to make a Shot at them; the <HI>Captain</HI> demanding of the <HI>Indians, What they were?</HI> Who said, <HI>They were Murtherers:</HI> Then the said <HI>Stanton</HI> having leave, let fly, Shot one of them through both his Thighs; which was to our Wonderment, it being at such a vast distance.</P>
<P>We then loaded our <HI>Bark</HI> with Corn; and our <HI>Indians</HI> their <HI>Canoes:</HI> And <HI>thirty</HI> more which we had taken with Kittles, Trays, Matts, and other <HI>Indian</HI> Luggage. That <HI>Night</HI> we went all aboard, &amp; set Sail homeward: It pleased GOD in a short Time to bring us all in safety to the Place of our Abode; although we strook and stuck upon a Rock. The Way and Manner how GOD dealt with us in our Delivery was very Remarkable: The Story would be somewhat long to trouble you with at this time; and therefore I shall forbear.</P>
<P>Thus we may see, <HI>How the Face of</HI> GOD <HI>is set against them that do Evil, to cut off the Remembrance of them from

<P>OUR <HI>Commons</HI> were very short, there being a general scar|city throughout the <HI>Colony</HI> of all sorts of Provision, it being upon our first Arrival at the Place. We had but one Pint of strong Liquors among us in our whole March, but what the Wilderness afforded; (the Bottle of Liquor being in my Hand) &amp; when it was empty, the very smelling to the Bottle would presently recover such as Fainted away, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|pened by the extremity of the Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: And thus we Marched on in an uncoath and unknown Path to the <HI>English,</HI> though much fre|quented by <HI>Indians.</HI> And was not the Finger of GOD in all this?

remember a Speech of Mr. HOOKER at our going aboard; THAT THEY SHOULD BE BREAD FOR US.
