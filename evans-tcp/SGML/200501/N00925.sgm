<P>THE Words of the Text give us an account both of the Reason and Ways and means whereby the great work of Conversion was wrought upon these <HI>Thessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onians,</HI> so as to be turn'd from their Infidelity, and Idolatry, unto GOD as it is in Verse the 9<HI>th, That they were turned to GOD</HI> from Idols to serve the Living and True GOD, and to wait for his SO<HI>N</HI> from Heaven V. 10. which as they did then, (tho' there are now passed since that time above Sixteen Hundred Years until now&punc;) so do all the Faithful now alive, still wait for the same; even for the outward and visible appearance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Lord Jesus Christ, in his Glorified Body; having the true and intire Nature of Man most highly glorified to judge both the quick and the dead, at the great Day of Judgment: This all True Christians wait for, and have all along wasted for, with a Fresh and Lively Hope, in all ages of Christianity past, and will so do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mes, with as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Expectation, as if it were nigh at Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Gospel</HI> hath this singular Excellency in it above the <HI>Moral Philosophy</HI> taught by the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">then Philosophers,</HI> and also above the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> singly and abstractly considered, that a converting power goeth along with it to such to whom it is preach'd in the truth and sincerity of it's Doctrine; and on this account it is called by St. <HI>Paul, the power of God to Salvation</HI> to every one that believeth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1 16. Whereas the same Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith of the <HI>Law, that it was weak</HI> (Rom. 8&punc; 3. <HI>through the flesh,</HI> and that neither Justification nor Life could be had by it; <HI>Gal.</HI> 2 21. and 3 21. which is not to be so understood, as if either before the Law, or in the time of the Law, many Sinners were not converted unto God&punc; but whoever were converted, either before the Law or in the time of the Law, their conversion was wrought not by the Law, but by the Gospel, that was both before it, and in the time of it: for as the Scripture saith, <HI>the Gospel was preach'd to</HI> Abraham, and not only was it preach'd to <HI>Abraham,</HI> but to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n that primitive Promise given after the Fall, concerning <HI>the seed of the Woman which should bruise the head of the Serpent,</HI> and to all the Faithful in all ages) <HI>Gen.</HI>3 15.</P>
<P>BUT it pleased God, that the preaching of the Gospel, in the most ample and clear manner, and with the greatest Power and Ex|tent, so as not only to extend to the Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> but to the <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations&punc; should be reserved to the coming of the <HI>Messiah</HI> in the flesh, and his Death and Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on Resurrection and Ascention and that for the greater Honour of our Blessed Saviour, who by his Death abolished Death, (and him who had the power of it) <HI>i. e,</HI>

<P N="1">I. What St. <HI>Paul</HI> here means by the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">II. Why, and how he calls it our Gospel.</P>
<P N="3">III. How, and after what way it wrought the conversion of those <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and daily works the conversion of Sinners to whom it is preached in the sincerity of its doctrine.</P>
<P N="4">IV. And Lastly, how that assurance was wrought in them men|tioned in the Text, both with respect to their being assured of the truth of it&punc; and also of their conversion by it.</P>
<P>AND not to insist much on the latter part of the Text, <HI>as ye know what manner of Men we were among you</HI> for your sake, and as it is Chap&punc; 2 10. <HI>Ye are witnesses and God also, how holyly, justly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we behaved our selves among ye that believe,</HI> they afford us this profitable observation.</P>
<P>THAT where the Preachers of the Gospel are of Exemplary Lives and Conversations, in all Godlyness and Virrue, the preach|ing of it will have the greater Effect upon the hearens, which yet is not to suspend the Efficacy of it upon the Holyness of the Minister, for he who lives according to the Gospel which he preacheth, he builds up, both with his Doctrine and Life; but he who preacheth Sound Doctrine, and his manner of Life and Conversation is con|trary, he as it were throws down with the one hand, what he builds up with the other.</P>
<P>To begin then with the first,</P>
<P N="1">I. What St. <HI>Paul</HI> here means by the Gospel.</P>
<P>IT might be thought a needless labour in a Christian Congre|gation and Countty, such as this by Profession is, to resolve such a question, seeing every Sincere Professor of Christianity doth know what the Gospel is; but yet considering the false notion of the Gospel that false Teachers, who swarm in divers party of Christ|endom, and do too much abound in these <HI>American</HI> parts, as else|where, have vented, and continue to vent, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, to the great

hurt of Souls, to the begetting in their Hearers a false Faith, and to the overthrowing the true Faith, where they can prevail; I hope it will be acceptable to this Auditory, to hear me give you a descrip|tion of the true Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Holy Scripture, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hall God willing do, after I have shewed you the false notion of the Gospel, which these false Teachers publish as if it were the true, which is another Gospel, not true but false; for there is but one true Gospel: And so by preaching this false Gospel to their Hearers, they bung themselves under the Curse <HI>Gal. 1 8;</HI></P>
<P>THE false Gospel which these false Teachers do teach to these Hearers is this, that <HI>the eight within every Man and Woman that comes into the World, that reproves some common sins, and instructs them in some common duties of general Piety towards God as Creator, and of common morality, of temperance, and justice &amp;c.</HI> among Men, is the Gospel yea the whole Gospel, and that there is nothing beside or beyond that; that is the Gospel. And this <HI>light within,</HI> every Man and Woman they say <HI>is sufficient to Salvation without any thing else,</HI> as some of their chief Authors affirm; and as others say, is a sufficient guide to Salvation, <HI>even without the Holy Scriptures,</HI> tho' they generally confess, that <HI>this light within them, without the Holy Scriptures teacheth them nothing of Christ</HI> without them, as he is both God and Man, as he was miraculously conceiv'd by the Holy Ghost in the Womb of the Virgin, and born of Her, as he suffered under <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> was crucified, dead and buried, rose and as|cended <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor indeed doth it teach them any one intire Article of the Apostles Creed, from whence it evidently appeareth that the whole Creed, and every one of the Articles of that Creed, is ex|cluded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">them to be any part of their Gospel.</P>
<P>THE utmost extent of their Gospel reaches no further, but to the Principles and Precepts of Natural Religion, and excludes all the peculiar Doctrines, Precepts, Promises and Threatnings which God delivered by Special Revelation to his Holy Prophets and A|postles, and which were by them committed to Writing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> delivered us in the Holy Scriptures from being any part of that Gospel.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001108_0006_0FB0430C1480DEF0">NOW though the Principles of Natural Religion which are the Results of our enlightned Reason, enlightened by the Father of Lights, and by that True Light which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1 17. <HI>John</HI> 1 9. are all good and necessary in their place, and are all and every one of them Record|ed in the Holy Scripture, and particularly in the Books of the Holy Evangelists, and the Epistles of the Holy Apostles; and in that re|spect, as so delivered, may be said, and ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">teemed, to belong to the Gospel in a general way, as common both to Reveal|ed and Natural Religion; as the <HI>genius</HI> or kind of Animal or living Creature belongs both to Man and Beast, yet as Men and Beasts are distinguished <HI>in specie</HI> by this specifical difference, that Man is an intelligent rational Being, capable to know God and to enjoy him, and capable of a great deal of knowledge, in the Creation, which Beasts are not capable of, so no less <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> with the Principles and Precepts thereof <HI>&amp;c.</HI> differs specifically from <HI>Na|tural,</HI> with respect to what is specifical and peculiar to the same; in fine, as all the true Principles of Natural Religion, directed by the Light within, generally common to all Mankind, and which all Mankind have, or at least may have without Special Reveala|tion, are contained within Revealed Religion: so the Revealed Religion, by which I mean the Christian Religion, doth contain a great many more Principles, which are the Fundamentals thereof; as also divers positive Precepts, and precious Promises, as well as severe Threatnings, together with most Excellent Examples of holy Life, and other most useful Historical Instructions, that <HI>Natural</HI> Religion doth nothing reach unto.</P>
<P><HI>* Note, that Natural Religion is so called from the subject Recipi|ent, which is the very nature of Man, whereas the Author of it, and principal Efficient is God, as truly as he is of Revealed Religion.</HI></P>
<P>For Example, It is a Principle of Natural Religion, that God is, and that he made the World, that he is True and Faithful, Good, Just and Wise, that he cannot deceive nor be deceived, that he is to be Loved, Feared, Worshipped and Praised by all Mankind; and
<PB N="6" REF="001108_0007_0FB0430F249D17B8">
that Men should be just, sober and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, and do to all Men, as they would have all Men do to them: And as Natural Religion dictates all this without the Lines of Holy Scripture, and without all special Revealation, so special Revelation given to the Prophets under the Old Testament, and enlarged to the Apostles under the New contains all this, and Christ himself did utter that Golden Rule, <HI>whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye the same to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets;</HI> which in substance is also a Principle or Precept of <HI>Natural Religion.</HI></P>
<P>BUT He did not say it is all which the Law and Prophets con|tain, as necessary to be believed and practised in order to Salvati|on; and consqeuently neither that, nor all the other Principles, and Precepts of Natural Religion, are the whole contents of the Gos|pel, nay, nor are they either the greatest or most excellent parts, but these are the most excellent parts of the Gospel, which deliver to us those most Sublime Doctrines, Precepts and Promises con|cerning Gods Love to us in Christ, and that High and Holy Cal|ling, he has called us with unto Holyness and Righteousness, as the means, and eternal Life and Happiness as the end, which no Light of Natural Religion doth lead us unto, alone and by it self considered.</P>
<P>AND though sincere obedience to all the Precepts of Natural Religion is most necessary to every Christian in order to Salvation, yet the peculiar Principles of Christianity, such as Revealed Reli|gion is, doth afford us far more noble Motives to excite us to obe|dience, as well as far greater inward Aids and Assistances: to wit, those of Gods special Grace, are given us through the Gospel; so that which St. <HI>Paul</HI> said of the Law writt in Stone given of God to the Jews, that it was weak and could not make perfect; the same may be said of Natural Religion, and the Laws and Precepts there|of, commonly called the Law of Nature, whereof Nature i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the subject Recipient, but God is the great Author and Efficient.</P>
<P>Having thus shewed you what that false Gospel is, of false teach|ers that are come into these parts of the World, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Dis|ciples and Followers here away, as well as elsewhere. I proceed now to show you out of the Holy Scriptures, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="7" REF="001108_0008_0FB04310B8F38F30">
by the Gospel here, and what is meant generally by it in the Holy Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament; for though the word or term Gospel is more frequent in the <HI>N</HI>ew Testament, yet it is to be found more than once in the Old Testament, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 61 1. and that quoted in <HI>Rom.</HI> 10 15. out of <HI>Isa.</HI> 52 7.</P>
<P>The greek word that is translated <HI>Gospel</HI> signifieth glad tydings, or a good and joyful message, and according to this, the true defi|nition of the Gospel is, that it is a doctrin of such glad tydings to Sinners, as holds forth to them the promises of eternal Life and Salvation through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith in Jesus Christ, and obedience to his com|mands delivered us by his Holy Evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, Prophets and Apostles in the Holy Scriptures, containing certain high and sublime, and yet most necessary Articles and Principles of Faith, that are the fun|damentals of the Christian Religion; such as the doctrin of the H. Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son, and how that he is both God and Man, yet one Lord Jesus Christ; how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is our Prophet, Priest and King, our Prophet to teach us outwardly by his Word, and in|wardly by his Spirit; our Priest, as he offer'd up himself a Sacrifice without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ot to God, well pleasing and acceptable to him, upon the Cross; who made there (by his own oblation of himself once of|fred) a full, perfect and sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfacti|on for the sins of the whole World. A King, to command, guide and govern us by his holy Laws, delivered us in the H. Scriptures, as well of the Old Testament (excepting the Ceremonial parts, and some positive judicial Laws peculiar to the Jewish Nation) as of the New, and to protect and defend us here in this World, and to crown us with the reward of an eternal Inheritance in the World to come, who has promis'd to write these his laws in our hearts, and to give us his holy Spirit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">able and incline us to perform sincere obedience to him, from his shedding abroad his Love in our Hearts, which is the great motive of all sincere Christian Obedi|ence, and indeed the doctrin of the Holy Trinity, as well as of the incarnation of the Son, are such fundamental doctrins of Christiani|ty (as well as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se other contained in the Apostles Creed&punc; where|of the Nic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>Athanasian</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reeds are the explanations) that the removal or denyal of them, is a denyal of the Christian Religion,
<PB N="8" REF="001108_0009_0FB0431137B3A8A8">
for without the doctrin of the Holy Trinity, which those false Teachers make no part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Gospel, and which many of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and argue against, not only there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> but against there being <HI>three,</HI> otherwise than n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> three Manifesta|tions or Operations, (which was the old <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"></HI>) and that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they <HI>be three, they are either three substances, and word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> three Gods, or three Nothings, and so they are three Nothings as they conclude.</HI></P>
<P><HI>[So hath</HI> W. P. <HI>argued in his sandy foundation]</HI></P>
<P>NOW without the doctrin of the Holy Trinity, how can we understand that Saying of our Blessed Saviour? That God so loved the World, that he gave his only beloved Son, that whoever be|lieveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life <HI>John</HI> 1 16.</P>
<P>And as God the Father gave us his dear Son to die for us, so as the Scripture testifieth. Jesus Christ the Son gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, <HI>Titus</HI> 2 14. He died for our Sins, that we might die to Sin, and live to him who died for us. He suffer'd most grievous pains and dolours both of Body and Soul to expiate our Sins, and reconcile us to God. And though his bodily suffer|ings were great, yet the sufferings of his Soul were far greater, in so much that he said, his Soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, he poured forth his Soul unto death, yet his Soul did not die; but had his Soul been capable of death, the sufferings of his Soul were so great as might have slain it, but being immortal it could not die&punc;</P>
<P>These are the great motives which the Gospel furnisheth us with, to constrain us to love God and Christ, and yield ready obedience to their Commands.</P>
<P>Thus he who was God, equal and one in Essence with the Father became Man, and humbled himself to the shameful, painful and cursed Death of the Cross, to make us, the Sons of God. And for|asmuch as the Children were partakers of Flesh and Blood, he took part of the same (as well as a true reasonable Soul of Man) there|fore he is not ashamed to call us Brethren, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of</HI> Abraham, and because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e took not the nature of Angels, therefore he was no Sacrifice for
<PB N="9" REF="001108_0010_0FB04311E3662A10">
Sins for the fallen Angels, but for the Sins of the whole World, of Mankind, and had been there ever so many worlds, his Sacrifice had been sufficient for them all that descended of <HI>Adam.</HI> And tho' the Holy Angels than stood, had him not to propitiate for them, yet he is become their Head, and they own their standing and per|severance to him who is their Head, Lord and King.</P>
<P>BUT in Reverse to all this, those false Teachers, as they preach a false Notion of the Gospel, as if it were nothing but the <HI>light within them,</HI> as it dictates those common principles of Moral Piety, Justice and Temperance, so they teach a false Notion of Christ within, his being their Priest within, and offering himself a Sacrifice within them to appease the wrath of God, and because without shedding of blood as the Scripture saith, there is no remis|sion of Sins, they have a false Notion of Christs Blood shed within them, denying his Blood that was outwardly shed on the Tree of the Cross to be the Blood of the Covenant, for the remission of Sin, arguing that the Covenant is inward and Spiritual, and that So is the Blood of it; and because that Blood is called the Blood of God in Scripture, that therefore it was not the Blood of Christs Huma|nity, but of Christ as he was God; affirming that the Blood is the Life, and the Life is the Light, and the Light is within.</P>
<P><HI>[All this is proved in my printed Narratives.]</HI></P>
<P>BUT now let us hear what account the Holy Scripture giveth us of the Gospel, what it is, and what it teacheth, as any natural Science is best defined by what it teacheth, as we best define Geo|metry, Navigation and Astronomy by what they teach, so to define the Gospel is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">how what the Gospel teacheth, and especially the peculiar Doctrins, Precepts and Promises o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</P>
<P>THUS the Angel that preach'd our Saviours Birth to the Shep|heards, said to them <HI>Luke</HI> 2 10. <HI>Behold I bring you the Gospel, or good Tydings of great Joy, which shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to all People,</HI> as being one great Fundamental of the Gospel; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> St. <HI>Paul</HI> defines the Gospel which he was sent to preach, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1 3. by what it taught <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cern|ing Jesus Christ, made of the Seed of</HI> David <HI>according to the flesh, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Son of God with power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y his Resurrection from the dead,</HI> and generally in his Epistles, and way of preaching, he
<PB N="10" REF="001108_0011_0FB04312D5D62DF0">
shewed him to be both God and Man yet one Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>AND that <HI>he dyed for our Sins</HI> 1 (or. 15 3. according to the Scriptures, S. <HI>Paul</HI> makes it to be one of the first things he preach'd to the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rinthians</HI> belonging to the Gospel according to the Scrip|tures, and <HI>that he was buried and rose again the third day</HI> according to the Scriptures, and as he preached it as one of the first peculiar doctrins of the Gospel, that Christ died for our Sins and rose again, so he held it forth as a standing doctrin necessary to be remembred by the most grown Christians, and to be meditated upon, which was his own practice 2 <HI>Cor. </HI> 5 14. and which he recommended to <HI>Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thy,</HI> 2 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im.</HI> 28. <HI>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of</HI> David <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> from the dead</HI> according to my Gospel.</P>
<P>THIS refutes that vile Error of such o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> those false Teachers, that say the Death and Resurrection of Christ is not to be remem|bred nor preached, most grosly perverting the Gospel, or as others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, it is not needful to be minded by them that are spiritual, and know Christ in them, the doctrin of Christ without, as he suffered death in the flesh and rose again, being in their account but as a Primmer of Horn book, that is, not to be minded by them that are grown up to maturity, but surely S. <HI>Paul</HI> and holy <HI>Timothy</HI> were beyond them all, and yet we see S. <HI>Paul</HI> did recommend this Sub|ject to him, to remember and meditate upon. And should we not be most ungrateful to our dear Lord, not to remember him continu|ally, who as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e once dyed for us, so he ever lives to make intercession for us,</HI> and continually presses to his Father in Heaven the merit of his Passion, for the forgiveness of our Sins. And though his Priestly Office upon Earth for us was finished on the Cross, yet in Heaven he is a Priest for ever to render God propitious to us, <HI>Psalm</HI> 110 V. 4.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Second Thing I proposed to speak to was why and how S. <HI>Paul</HI> calls it our Gospel.</P>
<P>THIS I shall answer briefly, because it was his and his Bre|threns instrumentally and ministerially, as it was Gods and Christs Gospel principally and chiefly, being the great Authors of it; even as the Doctrin which the Apostles preached, is called the Apostles Doctrin; and this affords us a worthy observation, that the Gospel
<PB N="11" REF="001108_0012_0FB04313D4BCEDF0">
is not meer Power, or Spirit, or Light within, without all words or form of doctrin outwardly delivered by the ministry of Men, but it is a ministry of words by Men, as well as it has an inward mini|stry of Power, and of the Holy Ghost, that doth accompany it. It comes not to Men, in Power and in the Holy Ghost without words and doctrin, nor in word only, without the power of the Holy Ghost, where it is made instrumental to convert Sinners to God, but it comes both in words and power of the Holy Ghost to such who are converted by it, and though it work not irresistably, nor without Mens concurrance who are converted by it, yet it worketh so effectually, and also so gently and gradually, that it obtaineth its end, in all the Heirs of Salvation, that in due time, it works a through Conversion in them and upon them; though the begining of the work of conversion be as a seed, the least of all seeds, yet it takes Root in the good Ground, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orth in season the hun|dred, sixty, or thirty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old.</P>
<P N="3">III. To the Third, how and after what way and manner, and by what helps, the Gospel wrought Conversion upon those <HI>Thessa|lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ians,</HI> and daily works the conversion of Sinners to whom it is preached, and who are converted by it.</P>
<P>TO this I answer,, tho' the doctrin of the Gospel has most ex|cellent Reasons, and Arguments to move and perswade Sinners to turn to God by Faith, and Repentance, yet it is not effectual of and by it self, to turn any to God; but it is made effectual, as it comes to the Consciences and Hearts of Sinners in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, according to the words of the Text, <HI>our Gospel</HI> (said <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>came unto you not in word only; but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost,</HI> for unconverted persons are dead in Sins and Trespasses, are spiritually blind and deaf, and alltogether lame and impotent and under the power of Satan, and held in captivity to him as his slaves, therefore it must be a stronger power, than the power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Satan that must convert a Sinner, and that is the mighty power of God, and of the Holy Ghost, to quicken the dead Soul, to open the Eyes of the Mind, and to unstop the Ears of the Soul and to heal the spiritual lameness and impotency of it.</P>
<P>AND thus the Power of the Holy Ghost, which is also the
<PB N="12" REF="001108_0013_0FB0431423EA9868">
power of God the Father and of his Son, works by and with the Word, to wit the external Word; to illuminate the Understanding with a saving knowledge of the truths of the Gospel, working also conviction of Sin, and contrition of Heart for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in, and deep Humiliation and Repentance, and also the same power worketh up|on the Will and Affections to turn them from the love of Sin, and Vice to the love of God and of Christ, and to all Holyness, Right|eousness and Virtue, gradually destroying in them Sin and Vice, and planting and raising up in them all Christian Virtues and fruits of the Spirit, and all this gradually, as we are workers together with God, and by his help, for as it is God who worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure, so he commandeth us, from this noble encouragement, to work out our salvation, (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Terms and Conditions of it) with fear and trembling: So that we must not be meerly passive in our Conversion, as so many Stocks and Stones, but as Reasonable Creatures, working together with him; and following after him as he gently leads and draws us.</P>
<P>THE Power mentioned here in the Text, and which ordinarily wrought the Conversion of Sinners in the Apostles Days, was not altogether the Power of Miracles, but the sanctifying Power, and Grace of the Holy Ghost; whereby many were converted, who never saw a Miracle wrought, tho' they heard of that Miraculous Power; as we also have heard of it, from many more witnesses, to wit, the constant testimony of many thousands of all these past ages since the days of the Apostles, the bare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Miracles never converted any, without the inward power of saving and sanctifying Grace, but the power of saving and sanctifying Grace hath convert|ed many thousands, and still doth, without the power of Miracles. The Church of God hath been in all ages, and a Ministry, and con|verting Power attending it, but the Church hath been o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t without having the power of Miracles; and may be, and is well enough with it. And as for the Miraculous Gifts of Tongues, and other extra|ordinary Inspirations of the Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Paul</HI> said, that they should cease, when <HI>Faith Hope</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> (all which are more excellent and most necessary) should remain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Cor.</HI> 138. 13.</P>
<P>BUT because the Church of <HI>England</HI> and other Protestant
<PB N="13" REF="001108_0014_0FB04314F212E0D0">
Churches lay not claim to the Power of working Miracles, and ex|traordinary inspirations, such as the Papists, and some of the Qua|kers lay claim to, by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ained Miracles.</P>
<P>* <HI>As</HI> Geo: Fox <HI>the Quakers great Apostle has done, as is to be seen in divers places of his printed Journal.</HI></P>
<P>* Therefore those false Teachers, falsly charge the Church of <HI>England</HI> with denying all inward operations and inspirations of the Holy Spirit in the Hearts of the faithful, which are of a sanctifying nature; and thus by their Lyes and Falshoods those false Teachers have prevailed to draw away many Proseli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es after them, both here away and else where. But that the Church of <HI>England</HI> doth own the inward sactifying Inspirations of the Holy Spirit, and the ne|cessity of them, for our sanctification, and to enable us to perform all Christian Duties acceptably to God, is evident from the daily publick Prayers in the publick Offices, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he prays for the Ca|tholick Church, <HI>that God would inspire her continually with the spirit of Truth Unity and Concord,</HI> and in the <HI>Collect</HI> before the Ten Com|mandments she prayeth thus, <HI>Clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se the thoughts of our Hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee and worthily magnify thy holy Name through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> Is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not therefore a sad Victory which those false Teachers boast over the Church of <HI>England&punc;</HI> whose foundation is laid in notorious lying and falshoods, as well as in Anti-Christian Principles.</P>
<P>THIS serves also to confute the false pretence of the manner of Conversion, among the Quakers, by a meer inward power, with|out the ministry of the written word, and without all doctrin, which may well be called (as some have called it) <HI>a dumb Gospel,</HI> and on this pretext they ground their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ent meetings, and two of their no|ted Preachers I could name, who have owned in Print their conver|sion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Quakerism by the power that seized on them in the Quakers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt meetings.
