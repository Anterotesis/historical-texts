<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greatest reluctance that I address you on this very important occasion. I feel conscious of my inability to perform any thing equal to what might be expected on a day like the present: And I should not have so mistaken my abilities, as to undertake a part to which I feel inadequate, had it not been for an invitation from gentlemen, whose stations and characters demand my utmost attention: But the benevolence of those worthy characters assures me of their candour, and that, the veil of humanity will be spread upon my imperfections: And I doubt not but I shall have the indulgence of this respectable, and very numerous assembly, while I attempt to speak briefly upon those things, which are important and interesting.</P>
<P>IN almost every age, events have taken place, which have had effect upon the political world; but in the present, scenes are before us, presenting to view prospects, pleasing and happy, of which, history affords us no example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032251_0006_0FF1ABFC2F33ADE0">WHEN the productions of time thus swell the thoughts with imaginations, they, who are of a patriotic spirit, will naturally suffer their attention to be engaged by those things, that are most interesting to themselves and posterity.&mdash;And when we attend to those happy events, and the pleasing prospects that now brighten up to our view, they not only add lustre to our eyes, but fill our hearts with raptures; nor can we resist their charms, unless we are to an awful degree insensible.</P>
<P>WE have been delivered from scenes of bloodshed, from disso|lution, and from the direful clangors of war. And our ears have been happily saluted with the agreeable sounds of peace and harmony. We have since established a Constitution, which unites the wisdom of ages; guarding, at the same time, against tyranny on the one hand, and anarchy on the other; and secures us from those shackles, which had been almost the overthrow of this rising Empire. And the illus|trious WASHINGTON, who led us through a long and tedious war, and conducted us safe to the port of Peace, is placed at the head of our public affairs; at whose name, haughty tyrants tremble, and under whose mild administration, the distressed of all nations find protection and relief.</P>
<P>HE, who was able to resist the power of Great-Britain, has since at various periods, sustained all the blasting storms of calumny, and under the most difficult situations, has been able to transact the busi|ness of the nation unmoved.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032251_0007_0FF1ABFDBA76C818">OUR increase of power has been great&mdash;our prosperity has exceeded the most sanguine expectations&mdash;it indicates a series of prosperous days, and presages to us such national glory, as is beyond the power of language to describe. Having sprung into Empire, we have, in the course of a few years, gained that height of national dignity and grandeur, which can be known and understood, only by comparing it with the state of nature.</P>
<P>MEN in the state of nature, and unconnected by social obligations, were abhorrent to the idea of dependence; and being actuated by immediate and necessary exigencies, they displayed, without constraint, the most criminal brutality in their manners. Their selfish and un|cultivated minds, impelled them to acts of injustice, violence, and murder. Such was the wretched and miserable state of man, when unconnected by society! Involved in the dark mazes of anarchy and confusion, they proclaimed eternal war upon their own species.&mdash; But, being pressed with the evil, and expiring under the weight of their own folly and wickedness, they were led, probably, to devise the best methods of relief, and stop the current of outrageous enor|mities. Doubtless they were driven by necessity to afford such reci|procal aids and supports, as eventually terminated in established Government. And the wisdom of all ages has been employed, and the genius of man has been put to the utmost stretch of imagination, to invent means to stem the current of passion, and avoid the calamities that are consequent upon their wickedness.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032251_0008_0FF1ABFF71E408A0">THE method hitherto adopted, is, to unite the strength of a whole community, to secure necessary rights to each individual. And, as this great power of the whole, cannot be exercised by the public at large, it is invested in one, or a few individuals. This communicated power, well administered, has been productive of good to mankind&mdash;it has restrained the violence of passion&mdash;it has soothed and softened the native ferocity of the mind, and rendered man, social, agreeable, and benevolent to man.</P>
<P>POLITICAL establishment has been considered the greatest bless|ing enjoyed by community&mdash;it is so essential that no society whatever can subsist without it. And it is necessary that some be invested with power, in order to an equal distribution of justice among the whole&mdash;that man may be protected from the violence and cruelty of man, and that all those rights destined by the GOD of nature may be secur|ed inviolate to man.</P>
<P>BUT alas! what a wretched use has been made of this power! Those, who have been invested with it, have held it independent and in defiance of their subjects. Rulers have thirsted for domination&mdash;they have invaded the rights of man&mdash;they have violated the laws of nature; and, to awe the patrons of liberty to submission, they have plied all the engines of despotism&mdash;they have wrecked and tortured them; and, had it been possible, would have ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">inguished the last spark of patriotism from the bosom of man. And being fired with ambition, and grasping at universal empire, they have warred, despot
<PB N="9" REF="032251_0009_0FF1AC01087E29F0">
against despot, till they have filled the world with devastation and murder.</P>
<P>IT is observed by a celebrated politician, that,
<Q>when we read the history of monarchs, we do but read the history of human devils;</Q>
and they, as though driven by fate, instead of justice and safety, have administered injustice, cruelty and death. Such has been their ambi|tion, that they have subjected the greater part of mankind to an almost entire submission to slavery. And the love of freedom, which nature planted in every breast, has been so far extinguished, that the inno|cent subject has been led tamely to prostrate himself before the Da|gon of tyranny. And being thus dejected and weakened by cruelty and oppression, the emissaries of darkness have used every artifice, that could be invented by their depraved minds, to chain down mankind in ignorance and superstition.</P>
<P>TH<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> Court of Great-Britain, notwithstanding their state of refinement, and their professed love to freedom and liberty, have shown themselves champions in the cause of tyranny. The Mon|arch of that Island is ever embroiling the nations of Europe; and being perpetually involved in war, he has, at length, by a series of conquests, gained the empire of the ocean. And were he possessed with the depravity of a nation, we could not conceive of his pervert|ing his power to viler purposes. He has attempted to deprive man|kind of those rights, which are unalienable, and which the GOD of nature destined to be inviolate.&mdash;He has assumed prerogatives over the rights and the consciences of men, which become none but the Supreme LORD and Governor of the universe.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032251_0010_0FF1AC06DD665A18">AT a time when Great-Britain was overspread with persecution and oppression, our pious and worthy ancestors, then denominated <HI>Puritans,</HI> were the objects of their persecuting vengeance; and being worn out with suing for redress, they quitted their native country&mdash;ventured their lives upon the vast ocean, to seek an asylum on the un|cultivated shores of America. Here they passed through divers scenes of sufferings and hardships, and were for a long time grieviously annoy|ed by the barbarous savages, who occupied the whole extent of so vast a territory. But, when they had gained a permanent settlement for their colonies, it was thought the happy fugitives were free&mdash;it was thought that they had escaped the grasp of tyranny, and, that the Brit|ish Annoyers of human liberty, would never trace out this far distant retreat. But, envying the happiness of mankind, how soon did the tyrants pursue, and fix their standard upon our shores! Armies were sent to enforce their unrighteous decrees&mdash;our laws were abolished&mdash;our shipping and our stores were taken and destroyed&mdash;our cities were laid in ruins by fire&mdash;the best of our citizens were insulted and murder|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">d; and to awe us into slavery the mercenary <HI>Germans</HI> were hired <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">gainst us to the trade of death! And he, whose heart is filled with pride and his hand ever stained with the blood of the innocent, point|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">d the arrows of death at every one, who breathed the celestial f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">ame of liberty, or dared to oppose his enormous wickedness!</P>
<P>WRETCHED state of our country! To us there was but one al|ternative; either we must be free and independent, or the worst of slaves, and vilely submit to be tortured by him, whose tender mercies are cruelty. We were, at this time, without government; we were destitute of stores, of arms and ammunition; our colonies were new
<PB N="11" REF="032251_0011_0FF1AC086B7C2BF0">
and small, and unskilled in the art of war&mdash;and tyranny had already laid its deadly grasp upon us! In this deplorable situation, had not our countrym<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">n been inspired with patriotism more than human, we must have sunk down under the cruel hand of oppression.</P>
<P>BUT Heaven interposed, and inspired the patrons of liberty with heroism, and a love of freedom unequalled in any age or nation. And on that ever memorable day, the <HI>Fourth of July,</HI> 1776, each one put his life in his hand, and resolved on liberty or death. Congress as|sembled to declare the States Independent&mdash;the citizens assembled in various parts to publish the declaration, and gave energy to the bold attempt. In this place was the day solemn and joyful&mdash;Heroism sat on every brow&mdash;fear was dispeled by virtue, and every heart aimed the fatal blow. And from the pious, prayers were offered up to God for success. Heaven heard their cries, and was attentive to the unequal combat; and all nature stood trembling for the event!</P>
<P>THE sentence was pronounced. <HI>America is free!</HI> Heaven caught the sound, and mixed with celestial fire, it reverberated back, and pierc|ed the very soul of tyranny; and unable to sustain the mighty shock, the frightful demon fell prostrate before the standard of liberty. At the disaster, the emissaries of tyranny stood amazed, and the vanquished demon, for the last time, reared his ghastly visage to see thrones tot|ter, and his empire of cruelty and oppression tremble to its lowest basis.</P>
<P>SUCH, my brethren, and fellow-citizens, was the mighty effect of the Declaration of Independence, on JULY the 4th, of which this Day is the twentieth anniversary. The transactions of that memorable day, gave an important turn to the affairs of the whole political world. The atchievements of that day, blew into a flame the celestial spark, which the God of nature had made sacred in every breast. What an
<PB N="12" REF="032251_0012_0FF1AC0D288AF3B8">
important turn was there in the affairs of America! While the British armies stood amazed at the dreadful overthrow of their Idol, the Sons of Freedom ran to arms; and, as if one soul had moved them all, around their heads they flashed their flaming swords&mdash;in martial pomp they fast advanced, and expelled those hostile legions from our shores. Nor did this complete the mighty scene, for the sacred fire pursued them over the vast Atlantic, and kindling in France, flamed through that vast country&mdash;broke off the tyrant's yoke, and set free more than twenty-five million souls. It has since shone conspicuously in various parts of Europe, and will e'er long illuminate the world with its meridian splendour.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS there are present, many of our Fathers and Brethren, who will recollect the solemn and important day, and the sacred love of liberty, which then glowed in every breast, and inspired them with courage and resolution to break asunder those bands of slavery, which were quick fastening upon themselves and posterity.</P>
<P>WILL not the hearts of those patrons of liberty swell to see us worthy of the freedom, which they purchased at so dear a rate? Will they not exult to see us possess their own spirit, and hail the happy day? Yea, what joy will possess their patriotic souls, while they be|hold us celebrating the day of their mighty atchievements?</P>
<P>LET us, my Brethren, perpetuate the happy day that gave birth to the American Empire, and laid a foundation for an universal repub|licanism through the whole political world. Let us show ourselves worthy of that liberty, which cost such an immense treasure of blood and wealth&mdash;that liberty, for which so many of our Fathers and Brethren bled and died. And in military manoeuvres this day, let us imitate those patriots, who gave the deadly wound to tyranny, and by one blow broke asunder the bands of slavery.</P>
