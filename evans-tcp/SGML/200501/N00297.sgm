<HEAD>A Sound and Through Conversion, is of absolute necessity in Order to the Souls Entrance into the King|dome of Heaven.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Matth. 18. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Verily, I say unto you, Except you be Con|verted, and become as little Children, you shall not enter into the Kingdome of Hea|ven.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THese Words were spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ; the occasion of them we may see in the first Verse of the Chapter; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> An Ambitious Enquiry amongst the Disci|ples, which of them should be the greatest Man, or have the greatest Dominion in the heavenly Kingdom of Christ: The Lord tells them in this Verse, that such Ambition was not the way to Heaven; but on the contrary, that if it did continue 
<PB N="2" REF="000374_0005_0FA55A1D0A18DAA8">
unmortified, it would surely exclude them out of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the words we may take notice of three things: 1. The main Truth which is here affirmed, <HI>sc.</HI> That Conversion is of absolute necessity, in order to obtaining the King|dom of Heaven, <HI>Except there be Conver|sion,</HI> or (which explaineth the other) ex|cept there be a <HI>becoming as little Children,</HI> even a <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and beginning the World <HI>anew,</HI> as it were, except there be this, there shall be no entring into the Kingdom of Heaven. 2. We have here the Persons unto whom this was spoken, <HI>sc.</HI> the Disciples of Christ; Except [you] my own Disciples be converted, I say to [you] that [ye] shall not enter: not but that they were converted already; yet this may well be spoken, even to convert|ed persons, thereby to convince them further of the necessity of that Conversion which they had already attained. Also, because though they were <HI>converted</HI> in re|spect of their <HI>state,</HI> yet they stood in need of a further Conversion, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a <HI>particular ill,</HI> which they were too much 
<PB N="3" REF="000374_0006_0FA55A1E900E9C68">
under the present prevailing power of. And this sheweth, that all men whatsoe|ver are concerned in the truth delivered: For if it be true concerning Disciples of Christ that they must be <HI>either Converted, or not saved,</HI> certainly this is true, <HI>concern|ing other men.</HI> 3. We have here the man|ner of the expression. This Truth is not barely affirmed, but with a <HI>Verily;</HI> Christ doth not only say, but pronounceth it with a <HI>Verily,</HI> saying, <HI>Verily, except you be Converted, you shall not enter into the King|dome of Heaven;</HI> which noteth both the certainty and the solemnity of the thing expressed. This word <HI>[verily]</HI> was fre|quently used by Christ, yet never but when there was some weighty and solemn truth affirmed by him. The <HI>Doctrine</HI> therefore which we shall (by the Lords assistance) speak unto from the words, is, 
<Q><HI>That it is a most certain and weighty Truth, that a sound through Conversion, is of abso|lute necessity, in order to the Souls extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ct into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000374_0007_0FA55A1F4CA9AB30">
In the Doctrinal prosecution of this point, we shall attend two things: First, we shall lay down some Propositions for clearing and opening the Truth about Conversion. Secondly, we shall demon|strate the Truth by Argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Explication of the Truth, may be set before us in sundry Propositions.</P>
<P>Propos. I. <HI>God is the principal cause and Author of that Conversion which is here spoken of.</HI> The words indeed may be ren|dred, <HI>Except you Convert;</HI> but that shew|eth rather mans duty, than his power to convert himself; I say, God and not man is the principal cause of this work. Hence converted persons are said to be <HI>born of God, and not of man;</HI> because not man, but God alone is the Author of Regene|ration, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 13. therefore it was that <HI>E|phraim</HI> prayed, <HI>TURN thou me, and I shall be turned, Jer.</HI> 31. 18. as if he had said, Ex|cept the Lord turn me, the work will ne|ver be done. And God doth this by his holy Spirit, therefore a converted person is said to be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> Joh. 3. 6. and, <HI>born after the Spirit,</HI> Gal. 4. 29. And the 
<PB N="5" REF="000374_0008_0FA55A1FFAAC7260">
Spirit of God is called, the <HI>Spirit of Grace, Heb.</HI> 10. 29. because all Grace, and especi|ally <HI>Converting Grace,</HI> is from him: The truth is, that as Conversion is taken for the infusing of a <HI>new Principal</HI> of Saving Grace into the Soul; so men are altoge|ther <HI>passive</HI> in their <HI>Conversion,</HI> and the E|ternal Spirit is the only principal Agent therein, Hence <HI>Conversion</HI> is called, <HI>a new begetting,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 3. Now in begetting, the thing begotten is not active but wholly passive: and it is called a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> or <HI>quickning of a dead person,</HI> Eph. 2. 1. Joh. 5. 14, 25. Hath a dead man power to raise himself out of his Grave; or is it in the power of Men or Creatures to quicken those that are dead? much-more may we say thus as to dead Souls, that are buried in a Grave of sin, guilt and misery: yea, in <HI>Converting a Soul,</HI> there is a <HI>Creating power</HI> put forth, <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 10. which sheweth both that the Soul is passive in this work; and also, that it is above the power of Men or Creatures to accomplish. Crea|tion is a bringing of something out of no|thing: Now inasmuch, as there is a kind 
<PB N="6" REF="000374_0009_0FA55A20B56163D8">
of Infinite distance between Being and No-being; therefore an Infinite power is required, to produce a work of Creation. So is it in <HI>Conversion.</HI> Nay, that's harder than meer Creation: because in the first Creation there was no opposition: But now when God enters upon this work of the <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w and second Creation,</HI> there is what|ever resistance all the powers of darkness can make against him. Look, as it is an easier matter to make a new Glass, than to mend a broken one; so it is easier to create a new Soul, than by Conversion, as it were, to <HI>make anew</HI> the broken, ruined Souls of men.</P>
<P>Propos. II. <HI>The Word of God is the In|strumental means of Conversion,</HI> James 1. 18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us, with the word of Truth.</HI> God is (as was said) the princi|pal Cause, but <HI>the Word of truth</HI> is the In|strument and Mean in the hand of the Spirit, whereby this mighty and astonish|ing work is brought to pass, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 7. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul.</HI> The word of the <HI>Law, strictly</HI> taken, is partly Instrumental and influen|tial 
<PB N="7" REF="000374_0010_0FA55A21D745C380">
to the Souls <HI>Conversion.</HI> For thereby is <HI>Conviction</HI> of sin and misery, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 20. <HI>By the Law is the knowledge of sin.</HI> If a man cometh to see and acknowledge him|self to be a sinful and miserable Transgres|sor, this conviction is by means of the Law. The <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law was a plain conviction and evidence of the guilt of sin. Hence it is called, <HI>the Hand-writing that is against us,</HI> Col. 2. 14. because it was as it were, a Bill of Indictment against the Observers of it: the <HI>Jews</HI> when they ob|served Circumcision, did thereby confess themselves guilty of Original Sin, which is the sin of nature; and when they of|fered any Sacrifice, they did thereby ac|knowledge, that they deserved to be dealt with, as they did unto that creature which was sacrificed by them; yea, to be made an Eternal Sacrifice to Infinite Justice. And the <HI>Moral Law</HI> doth convince of sin. When that in the holy nature and exact purity of it, is brought home to the Soul, Conscience is convinced and awakened thereby, with the sense of transgression and guilt. Hence the Apostle saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 
<PB N="8" REF="000374_0011_0FA55A240A479780">
7. 9. <HI>I was alive without the Law once:</HI> He speaketh of what he was, when in his na|tural, unconverted estate; before the Law was effectually brought home to his heart, he was alive in his own conceit: <HI>But when the Commandment came, I died;</HI> when God set the Law, in the spiritual nature of it before him, then his Conscience was tou|ched indeed, that he saw himself to be by nature, no better than a dead and damned creature: Now <HI>Conviction</HI> of sin is the way, and indeed the first step towards <HI>Conversion.</HI> But especially the Word of the Gospel is the great means of Conver|sion: Hence it is called, <HI>The ministration of the Spirit, and of life,</HI> 2 Cor. 13. 6. be|cause it is the mean by which Spiritual life is conveyed to the Elect. The Law without the Gospel will never Convert: Hence men that have been strangers to the Gospel, have been unacquainted with the mystery of <HI>Conversion,</HI> all their know|ledge in the Law notwithstanding. The Gentiles notwithstanding the Internal Law written in the heart; and the Jews notwithstanding their knowledge of the 
<PB N="9" REF="000374_0012_0FA55A2473ABD438">
External-Law, yet were strangers to true Conversion, because they knew not the Gospel in the power of it. The Law with|out the Gospel, will but drive to despair, and to set the sinner farther off from God, but will never bring him home to God a|gain: It is also true, that God doth many times bless Providences, Afflictions espe|cially, to help forward the Conversion of his Elect; but that is, by causing them thereby to mind and remember what the Word saith, <HI>Affliction maketh a sinner to think of Christ.</HI> But how came he to hear of a Christ, or to know that any help; to be had for his Soul? This knowledge is by the Gospel; so that still it remain|eth true, that the Word is the principal Means of Conversion.</P>
<P>Propos. III. <HI>In true Conversion, the Soul is turned from Satan, the World, Sin and Self.</HI> In all changes, there is the term <HI>from which</HI> the change is: now the Pro|position is expressive of the term <HI>from which</HI> the change in <HI>Conversion</HI> is wrought. There are four Particulars comprehended under this; we shall briefly touch upon 
<PB N="10" REF="000374_0013_0FA55A279D6F4B28">
each of them as they go along: 1. The <HI>Converted Soul</HI> is turned from Satan; therefore when <HI>Paul</HI> was Instrumental towards the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> he is said to turn them from the power of Sa|tan, <HI>Act.</HI> 26. 18. and when the <HI>Disciples</HI> were sent forth to Preach the Gospel, and thereby to <HI>Convert the World,</HI> Satan is said <HI>to fall before them,</HI> Luk. 10. 18. <HI>Conversion</HI> is the same with effectual vocation: Now in <HI>Vocation,</HI> the term <HI>from which</HI> the Soul is called, <HI>is Satans Kingdom,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 9. <HI>He hath called you out of darkness;</HI> namely, out of the dark Kingdom of Satan. 2. From the World; therefore Christ said to his Disciples after their conversion, <HI>Ye are not of the World, I have chosen you out of the World,</HI> John 15. 19. Sin doth carry away the Soul from God to the creature; but now in conversion, it is taken off from the creature again; as we see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 119. 96: <HI>I have seen an end of all per|fection:</HI> his heart was taken off from the creature, so as he did not look for his happiness there: The like we see in con|verted <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal: 6: 14: <HI>I am crucified to the 
<PB N="11" REF="000374_0014_0FA55A2A9F873678">
World, and the World unto me.</HI> The World was as a dead object before his eyes, which is unlovely and undesirable. 3. From <HI>Sin:</HI> Oft in Scripture, conversion is called <HI>turning from sin, Isai:</HI> 59. 20: <HI>Jer:</HI> 26: 3: and <HI>a breaking off from sin, Dan.</HI> 4. 27: and a <HI>casting away transgression,</HI> Ezek: 18: 31: <HI>Isai</HI> 31: 7: yea, it is a turning from all sin, <HI>Ezek:</HI> 18: 21, 30: Herein especially con|version doth consist; namely, in a true turning from sin; that is, <HI>when the life and heart is throughly divorced from every false and evil way.</HI> Men may confess sin, yet if they do not forsake it, this is no conversion, <HI>Prov:</HI> 28: 13: They may for|sake sin in their lives, yet if there be a love and liking unto any lust in the heart, there is no true conversion. But of this more afterwards. 4. The converted man is turned from <HI>Self</HI> also: This is the first, and indeed one of the hardest Lessons in Christianity, that a man must <HI>deny him|self, Mat:</HI> 16: 24: A natural man, maketh not only the World, but <HI>Self</HI> his God. He maketh <HI>himself</HI> his own <HI>Last end:</HI> He liveth to himself; but the converted man 
<PB N="12" REF="000374_0015_0FA55A2C52B57590">
doth not so. Herein is a main matter in Conversion, and that wherein the Truth of the work is discerned, namely, when the Sinner is indeed unbottomed from Self, especially from <HI>righteous Self:</HI> and Conversion doth imply a work of <HI>Humi|</HI>liation, which is that whereby the Soul is taken off from resting in righteous Self: Some there are that attain unto a seeming, and as it were, an half-conversion, but here they stick and perish; they do in part forsake the World and Sin, but then they go to duties and righteousness of their own: But in true Conversion, the Soul is taken off from this bottom also. Hence <HI>Paul,</HI> after his Conversion, could say, <HI>not having my own righteousness,</HI> Phil. 3. 9. He did renounce all that was his own; not only his own Sins, or his own Will, or his own Relations, so far as they stood in opposition to Christ, but his own Righteousness and all.</P>
<P>Propos. IV. <HI>In true Conversion; the Soul is turned to God in Christ.</HI> In all chan|ges there is <HI>the term to which,</HI> as well as the term from which the change is. Thus 
<PB N="13" REF="000374_0016_0FA55A2CB6BBDB28">
in Conversion, the former Proposition was expressive of <HI>the term from which;</HI> this is expressive of the <HI>term to which</HI> the Sin|ner is changed: we have them both men|tioned, <HI>Act.</HI> 26. 19. where the conversion of the Gentiles is called, not only a turn|ing <HI>from Satan</HI> and <HI>Darkness</HI> but <HI>unto God:</HI> Therefore it is said of <HI>John Baptist,</HI> that he should <HI>turn many of the Children of Israel into the Lord their God,</HI> Luk. 1. 16. be|cause he was instrumental towards their Conversion: God went forth with <HI>John Baptists</HI> Ministry to the conversion of ma|ny Souls, therefore he is said, <HI>to turn ma|ny to the Lord:</HI> and very often <HI>Conversion</HI> is called, <HI>a turning to the Lord,</HI> Deut. 30. 10. <HI>Hos.</HI> 1. 2. 6. <HI>Conversion</HI> is an undoing of the work of Sin; Sin is a departure from God: So <HI>Conversion</HI> is a going to him a|gain. Hence the converting Prodigal said, he would <HI>go to his Father,</HI> Luk. 15. 18. by these two parts, or terms, is the whole nature of Conversion described; see <HI>Isai.</HI> 55. 7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts.</HI> 
<PB N="14" REF="000374_0017_0FA55A2D819B3D58">
These words are expressive of the first part of Conversion; <HI>sc.</HI> when the sinner is turned from evil, and that not only as to his way, or outward conversation, but in his own thoughts, and inward disposi|tion of heart; it followeth, and <HI>let him re|turn to the Lord&mdash;To our God:</HI> These words are expressive of the other and po|sitive part of Conversion. Moreover, this turning must be to God in Christ, for true conversion is an <HI>Evangelical</HI> work; Though a Man should repent with legal Repentance, and turn to God in a legal way, this is <HI>no Conversion, if Christ be not turned unto, and God, even the Father in him.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> did thus return, yet they con|verted not, because they sought God <HI>out of Christ,</HI> Rom. 9. 32. Hence <HI>Conversion</HI> is called, a <HI>seeking of Christ,</HI> Hos. 3. 5. and <HI>Converted ones</HI> are described to be such as are in Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16. 7. <HI>Paul</HI> there saith, <HI>that his Kinsmen</HI> Andronicus <HI>and</HI> Junius <HI>were in Christ before him;</HI> meaning that they were <HI>converted before him, Christ,</HI> Gal. 3. 27. <HI>and to have put on</HI> Although there are ma|ny that call themselves Christians, that 
<PB N="15" REF="000374_0018_0FA55A2E458FFB10">
know not what Conversion means, yet a true <HI>Convert, and a true Christian,</HI> are the same: Conversion doth imply <HI>Faith in Christ.</HI> It hath been a great Question a|mongst some, <HI>Whether Faith or Repentance be first wrought;</HI> and a great deal of di|sputing there hath been about this point, which might have been spared. The true and plain Answer is, That as Repentance is taken for the first part of Conversion, so it is in order of Nature before Faith, though in Time with it: <HI>The term from which,</HI> is in order of Nature, before the <HI>term to which;</HI> but as Repentance is taken for the whole work of Conversion (as oft in Scripture it is) so it implieth Faith in Christ. You heard but now, that <HI>con|version</HI> and <HI>vocation</HI> are the same; now in <HI>Vocation</HI> the <HI>term to which</HI> the Soul is cal|led, is the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> Col. 1. 13. This Text doth intimate, that <HI>Converted ones</HI> are brought into the <HI>Kingdom of Hea|ven;</HI> and it must needs be so, because in Conversion, <HI>the term to which</HI> the Soul is brought, is <HI>the Kingdom of Christ;</HI> now that is meant by <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> 
<PB N="16" REF="000374_0019_0FA55A2F18AEB9C0">
even the <HI>Heavenly Kingdom of the Messiah:</HI> Christs Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Heaven are the same.</P>
<P>Propos. V. <HI>True Believers on Christ may undergo a farther, and as it were, a second Conversion.</HI> This is plainly (and indeed a main thing intended therein) intimated in the Text; Christ here tells his own Disciples, that except they were convert|ed; <HI>i. e.</HI> except there were a farther, and as it were, a new conversion wrought in them, and upon them, they should not see Heaven. There is an universal con|version, and a particular conversion: one in the state of nature, needs the former; a true Christian may stand in need of this latter. This may be secretly hinted at by that expression, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4. 3. <HI>Plough up the fal|low ground of your hearts.</HI> Fallow ground you know, is such as hath been once bro|ken up already; but by reason of its be|ing overgrown with weeds and thorns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may need a further and new break|ing up. So it is here, they that have had their hearts truly broken up for sin, may become <HI>fallow ground,</HI> so as to need 
<PB N="17" REF="000374_0020_0FA55A32143D6198">
that new furrows should be made in their Souls: They may be so overgrown with the weeds of sin, as that the Plough-share of Repentance must again break up their hearts. Conversion is sometimes taken for a <HI>spiritual habit</HI> infused into the Soul, so it is not to be reitterated; for the habit of Grace wrought in the first Conversion, is never lost. Sometimes it is taken for <HI>an act</HI> proceding from that habit: Thus a Man may be converted over and over a|gain; yea, thus a Christian is converting all his life long; that is to say, he is still getting farther off from sin and the world and nearer unto God in Christ; the life of a Christian is and ought to be a life of Faith and Repentance. Hence even true Believers yet are called upon to repent: So we find in those Epistles which the Lord Jesus sent from Heaven to the Chur|ches, they are commanded to repent that is, to <HI>renew their Repentance.</HI> And this truth is evident, in that a true Child of God may be too far subject to the pre|vailing power of some special corruption, in which case, a new or further conver|sion 
<PB N="18" REF="000374_0021_0FA55A33E8758370">
is requisite. This was the case of the Text; the <HI>Disciples</HI> were under the present predom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nancy of an ambitious Lust, in a great measure, therefore the Lord tells them, <HI>they must be converted.</HI> The like we find, in respect of another corruption in that good Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> see <HI>Ch.</HI> 15. 19. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, if thou return then will I bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me:</HI> You may see in the former Verse. that the good man was sur|prised with a pang of Unbelief; and while the temptation and corruption pre|vaded upon him, he manifests much im|patiency and murmurings of Spirit: Now saith God to him, <HI>if thou wilt return from these evil frame of Spirit if thou wilt con|vert thee from these evils then will I again make use of thee in my service,</HI> &amp;c. So that a very good man may be distempered with particular corruptions, so as to need a returning and converting from them to the Lord again. Yea, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a sad Truth, that a godly man may possibly be under the present power or some corruption, in such a degree, as that it is impossible for 
<PB N="19" REF="000374_0022_0FA55A35B5F14BB0">
him to get to Heaven until that corrup|tion be further mortified. This is plain|ly affirmed by the Text, Christ declareth to his Disciples, that except the lust of Pride were further mortified in them, they should not enter into Heaven. Some sins which true Believers are guilty of, they must and shall repent of them be|fore they go out of this World, that so they may be fit for Heaven.</P>
<P>Again, Grace may be exceeding weak in a true Believer, and in that case a fur|ther Conversion is necessary: Ordinarily it is thus with <HI>new-Converts;</HI> in such ma|ny times Grace is very weak, and corru|ption is very strong; there is little know|ledge, &amp; much ignorance; little humility, &amp; much pride; thence a further conversion must be. This we see in the Disciples themselves, a long time they were mar|velously ignorant, and yet too full of Pride and other Corruptions: but after the Ascention of Christ, there was a mighty change wrought in them; <HI>Then was that accomplished upon them, which here Christ said must be, a new Conversion,</HI> they were 
<PB N="20" REF="000374_0023_0FA55A374C0B6F60">
<HI>endued with power from on high,</HI> Luk. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 19. The Lord from on high poured his Spirit mightily upon them, and thereby were they wonderfully changed: The change which was then wrought upon the Disci|ples, was not much less, than that which was wrought on them at their first Con|version; they differed from what them|selves; were afore, well nigh as much as at their first conversion they were made to differ from other men.</P>
<P>Again, true Believers may be under sad spiritual <HI>decays,</HI> and in this respect they may need, as it were a <HI>new Conversion.</HI> This we see in the collapsed Churches of <HI>Asia;</HI> yea, a godly man may fall into gross sins, such as wast and wound the Conscience, and break communion with God; indeed into any sin, though never so vile, except only that sin against the Holy Ghost, and final Impenitency. Now in this case a new conversion is necessary; we see instances hereof in <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 51. 10. after his fearful fall and miscarriage in that matter about <HI>Uriah</HI> (for that, as the Title sheweth, was the occasion of his 
<PB N="21" REF="000374_0024_0FA55A38315205B8">
penning that Psalm) he prayeth, that God would <HI>create a clean heart, and renew a right spirit in him:</HI> He speaketh as if all the work of conversion were to begin anew again. And in <HI>Solomon,</HI> His <HI>peni|tent Soul</HI> wrote a Book of <HI>Repentance; Ec|clesiastes</HI> is the Book of <HI>Solomons</HI> Repen|tance, not of his first but of his second Repentance. And another Instance here|of we have in <HI>Peter:</HI> Hence Christ said to him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 32. <HI>When thou art convert|ed,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Peter</HI> was converted before that time, but Satan so far prevailed upon him, as that by the sudden surprizal of a tem|ptation, he became guilty of Lying and Perjury, and (which was worst of all) denied Christ too: Now in regard of this fearful fall into sin, he stood in need of being, as it were, <HI>converted anew;</HI> therefore Christ said to him, <HI>When thou art Converted,</HI> meaning, when he should have repented of his grievous Transgres|sion. Besides all this, the truth of what you hear is evident, if we consider the several steps of Conversion; <HI>e. g.</HI> A true Believer may undergo a new work of 
<PB N="22" REF="000374_0025_0FA55A38E71BFA68">
<HI>Conviction and Illumination;</HI> God may teach him that which he hath not yet seen, <HI>Job</HI> 34. 32. he may have further Vi|sions of God, and Visions of his own heart too, yea such discoveries, as may differ in degree, as much from the enlightnings received, when first Illuminated, as the knowledge of a man differs from the knowledge of a Child, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 11. and he may undergo a new work of <HI>Compun|ction or Contrition</HI> for sin. Hence <HI>David</HI> after his fall complains of <HI>broken bones, Psal.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 8. because his sin occasioned and caused as much grief to him, as if all his bones had been shivered in pieces. And <HI>Solomon</HI> found his Vanity in the end of it, <HI>more bitter than death,</HI> Eccles. 7. 26. And <HI>Peter,</HI> when his Conscience was touched with a saving remorse for his Sin, <HI>went out and wept bitterly,</HI> Mat. 27. <HI>ult.</HI> So for <HI>Hu|miliation,</HI> a true Believer may undergo that work anew: We see it in <HI>Job,</HI> after the sinful distempers of his Spirit had broke loose, he crieth out against himself, <HI>I am vile,</HI> Chap. 40. <HI>Ver.</HI> 4. And inasmuch as his Repentance and Humiliation was 
<PB N="23" REF="000374_0026_0FA55A3984CC9F58">
not altogether so deep and through as should have been, the Lord speaketh more awakingly to him until he cry out a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time. <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my self, and repent in dust and ashes,</HI> Chap. 42. 6. And the like we read concerning <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 32. 26. <HI>He humbled himself, for the pride of his heart;</HI> not but that he had humbled himself for that and other sins many a time, and many a day afore that time, but then he renewed his <HI>Humiliation</HI> before the Lord. and a further work of <HI>Conver|sion</HI> may be wrought upon the Believer, in respect <HI>of Separation from sin and amend|ment of life.</HI> Thus also with <HI>David</HI> Psal. 119. 67. <HI>Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word:</HI> not but that he made Conscience of his ways from his youth up, but that afflicti|on was a means to make him more cir|cumspect and exact in his walking before God. So the <HI>Corinthians</HI> after that hum|bling Providence about the Incestuous Person, were much reformed, 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 7. 11. Also in respect of closing with Christ, a true Believer may fall as it were, under a

<HI>second Conversion:</HI> we therefore read, <HI>that the Disciples believed</HI> Joh. 2. 11. the Dis|ciples believed before, otherwise they had not been called Disciples, but now they renewed their closing with Christ. So that the Holy Spirit doth sometimes go over the work of Conversion in all the steps of it, in the hearts of his Chil|dren, and that again and again; yea, and sometimes he doth all this in a very eminent manner:</P>
<P>Propos. VI. <HI>In the true Conversion, there is a change, even of the whole man.</HI> The sanctifying change wrought in Conversion must be proportionable to the defilement of natural corruption. Now that's total, what the Prophet speaketh, concerning that woful defection and corruption of the Jewish state, <HI>Isai</HI> 1. 6. <HI>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it but wounds, and bruises and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rifying sores</HI> may truly and fitly be applied unto the corrupted estate of all men by nature. This corruption of nature was Typified under the Law by the spreading Leprosie (<HI>Lev.</HI> 13. 12, 13.) which <HI>covered all the 
<PB N="25" REF="000374_0028_0FA55A3B2995EB78">
skin of him that had the Plague, from his head even to his foot.</HI> Now the Plaister must be answerable to the fore; therefore inasmuch as the corruption of nature is universal, as to all parts and faculties; so must Repentance and conversion be uni|versal. Hence a true Convert is said to be a new, and another creature, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 17. <HI>If any man be in Christ he is a new Creature: old things are passed away, be|hold all things are become new.</HI> In conver|sion, Heaven and Earth is new; that is to say, all is new from the top to the bottom; it's such another change as that, which shall pass upon the World at the last and great day: indeed, then the materials shall be the same, but there will be a won|derful alteration as to qualities; so it is when a Soul is converted. As if a man should deface a deformed Picture, and in the room of it should draw another com|pleat and beautiful; here the subject mat|ter is the same, only here's a new Image. Thus the holy Spirit draweth the blessed Lines of the Image of God on that Soul, where once was the deformed Image of 
<PB N="26" REF="000374_0029_0FA55A3C35847468">
Satan. But to evince the truth of this Proposition, by Induction of particulars. 1. In Conversion <HI>the head is made new</HI> A true convert hath a <HI>renewed mind.</HI> Eph 4. 23. Hence conversion is in the Scripture called, <HI>Illumination</HI> Heb 10. 32. and <HI>open|ing of the eyes</HI> of the Soul, <HI>Act</HI> 26. 18. Eph. 1. 18. Whenever God converts a Soul he lets in a new, and a blessed light into the Understanding, that the sinner hath other apprehensions about God, and Christ, and Heaven, and Sin, and Hell, and spiritual Objects, than once he had. Every con|verted Sinner may say, as the man that was born blind said, after Jesus Christ had healed him, <HI>Joh</HI> 9. 25. <HI>One thing I know that wherein I was born blind now I see.</HI> Some that are truly converted, cannot tell exactly the time, or the means, or manner of their Conversion; yet this they know, that now they see spiritual things with another kind of sight and ap|prehension, than once they did. The truth is, that conversion doth begin here: As in the <HI>first Creation</HI> God began with <HI>Light,</HI> so in this second and new creation, 
<PB N="27" REF="000374_0030_0FA55A3F42EB1200">
the Lord begins with effectual Convicti|on and Illumination. 2. In Conversion, the heart is made new, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 26. <HI>A new heart will I give.</HI> Converting Grace is promised to the Elect under that expres|sion. <HI>A new heart</HI> is given to a man, when that heart which once was hard and senseless, is become soft and tender; <HI>when an heart of stone, is turned into an heart of flesh;</HI> and when that heart which once was full of nothing but Pride and Vanity is become humble and meek. And when that heart which was foolish is become spiritually wise, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10. 8. The Heart is oft in Scripture, put for the Will; be|cause it is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat and subject thereof; as the head is of the Understanding. Now in Conversion, the will is wonderfully changed, <HI>Psal.</HI> 110. 3. <HI>A willing people in the day of thy power;</HI> when the day of Gods power doth pass upon the Soul in converting Grace, the Will is captivated. The Will then refuseth old sinful Objects which once were delighted in; and in|stead thereof, chuseth new and better Ob|jects: That Will which before obstinate 
<PB N="28" REF="000374_0031_0FA55A3FBB8BBA88">
and rebellious, is now become pliable to the will of God in every thing. You see it in <HI>Paul,</HI> when he was in the pangs of the new birth, <HI>Lord,</HI> saith he, <HI>what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> Act. 9. 6. And this a|lone proveth the truth of the proposition before us; for a change of the heart or Will, infers a change of the whole man; the reason is, because the will is the Em|press and Commandress of the Soul. Hence the <HI>act</HI> of any faculty or part belonging to a man, is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accounted the <HI>act</HI> of the whole, except the will be invol|ved in it. 3. In Conversion, <HI>the affecti|ons are renewed:</HI> A sincere Convert doth not affect those evils, which once he did affect; and doth <HI>affect</HI> those good things which once he did not <HI>affect:</HI> converting Grace causeth a marvelous change upon the affections; <HI>e. g.</HI> If we speak of Love and Hatred, when a sinner is converted, these <HI>affections</HI> are much altered and pla|ced upon new and other Objects: He loveth spiritual good things in the chief place; he loveth God and Christ above all, <HI>Psal</HI> 33. 25. <HI>Luk.</HI> 14. 26. he loveth Truth,

Ordinances, Saints, Holiness, as such, which the Natural man doth not; he ha|teth sin, and that universally, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 128. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 13. he hath an <HI>heart after Gods own heart,</HI> Act. 13. 22. that is to say he doth love the things which God doth love, and hates the things which God doth hate. Again the sincere Convert hath new joyes and sorrows in his Soul. As for the natural man, his chief joy and de|light is in some carnal, worldly object, ei|ther in the Pleasures, or Profits, or Ho|nours which the World affords: But as for the converted man, his chief delight is in Spiritual Objects; as in the favour of God, and communion with him by Jesus Christ, and in the precious promises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yea, he finds more sweetness in one good look from God in Christ, or in one Pro|mise, than in all that the whole Earth can afford, <HI>Psal.</HI> 46. <HI>&amp;</HI> 94. 19.</P>

way; but if ever he would come to his journies end, he must turn quite about, and go in a contrary way to that, which at present he walketh in.

The true Convert walketh in new wayes, and taketh new courses: he did walk in the way of sin, he doth walk in the way, which is called holy; he did walk in the broad way, he doth walk in the narrow way. 7.

there is nothing that doth make a greater discovery of a mans spirit, than the com|pany which he doth frequent and delight in.

<P>Argum. 3. <HI>Because one sin, if loved and liv'd in, will certainly exclude the soul out of Heaven.</HI> This Text doth plainly intimate that that one sin of unmortified Pride, is enough to keep out of heaven.

<P>Having opened and proved the Point, 
<PB N="39" REF="000374_0042_0FA55A4A717F4B90">
we proceed, in the Lords fear, to make some Application of it.</P>
<P>Now by way of <HI>Use,</HI> I. <HI>We may hence infer, That they that are truly and throughly converted to God in Christ, are in a very hap|py condition.</HI> There are two things here that do shew the happiness of such Souls: 1. In that a <HI>Kingdom is theirs,</HI> they do en|ter upon a Kingdom; therefore sincere Converts are called the children <HI>of the Kingdom,</HI> Mat. 13. 38. they are such chil|dren as have a Kingdom for their inheri|tance. Amongst men, a <HI>Kingdom</HI> is the highest dignity; so to shew the glorious happiness wherewith such shall be digni|fied, they are stiled <HI>Heirs of a Kingdom.</HI> 2. Another thing which sets forth their happiness, is <HI>the quality of the Kingdom</HI> which they shall possess, <HI>its an heavenly Kingdom:</HI> The Text calls it, <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> All earthly Kingdoms are as nothing, compared with this. This King|dom of Heaven noteth three things; all which do set forth the wonderful happi|ness of truly converted ones. 1. <HI>It noteth a state of saving sanctifying Grace:</HI> oft-times 
<PB N="40" REF="000374_0043_0FA55A4AC224FB10">
in Scripture, the being brought out of a state of Nature into a state of Grace is called <HI>entring into the Kingdom,</HI> Col. 1. 13. <HI>Mat.</HI> 21. 13. For then men are delivered out of Satans, and are become Subjects of the Lords Kingdom. Now they that are brought into a state of grace are happy indeed: for grace is Heaven begun; he that hath Grace, shall as certainly go to heaven, as if he were there already; which may be one reason why this expression, of the Kingdom of heaven, is put to signifie a state of Grace. 2. <HI>It may note the glory and dominion which the Saints shall possess at the last and great day,</HI> Luk. 22. 29, 30. <HI>I ap|point unto you a Kingdom&mdash;You shall sit upon Thrones judging,</HI> &amp;c. which evidently intimates, that at the Judgment-day the Saints shall have a Kingdom. And no doubt this is a special thing aimed at in the Text, as will appear to him that well considers the occasion of these words: and though the Judgment shall be in this low|er visible world; yet this is fitly called the <HI>Kingdom of heaven,</HI> because it will be a most heavenly dispensation; also in respect 
<PB N="41" REF="000374_0044_0FA55A4C0959E008">
of the original of it, the God of heaven will set it up. New <HI>Jerusalem cometh down from God out of heaven,</HI> Rev. 21. 2. In a word, at the last day, converted ones shall be so many heavenly Kings; there|fore happy are they. 3. <HI>This expression may note, that eternal bliss which the Saints shall enjoy with Christ in the highest heaven.</HI> Many times in the Scripture, Heaven, and the Kingdom of Heaven, noteth that life of glory which the saints shal partake of with Christ in Heaven to all Eternity. And this also is intimated here in the Text, to be the portion of converted ones. And be|sides these things which the Text expres|seth, there are other things that manifest the happy estate of such persons. For 3<HI>dly They are the Children of God.</HI> Christ pro|veth, that Peace-makers are blessed, be|cause they are the children of God; <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 8.

But <HI>are we not all converted? are we not all Christians?</HI> A|las Friends, deceive not your own Souls, I do beseech you: But therefore know. 1. <HI>They that remain ignorant in spiritual things are unconverted,</HI> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <HI>The na|tural man receiveth not the things of the spi|rit, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned:</HI> So that they that are unacquainted with the <HI>things of the spirit,</HI> are in their natural estate still.

And what shall we say of those that remain ignorant in Fundamen|tal Points in Religion? Some, though they live under Gospel-Light, yet are so, if they be examined about the great matters of Religion, especially about Christ, they be|wray lamentable ignorance.

Its not possible for the Soul to be entred into the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet to live in darkness and ignorance still. 2. <HI>They that are prophane either in heart or life, are unconverted.

Alas, how many such are there whose hearts flight and despise spiritual blessings, even as <HI>prophane Esau</HI> did? Oh the secret prophaneness &amp; Atheism of the hearts of men and women! Whence is it that many live in a careless neglect of God, and of the things of God, and of their own Salvation by Christ, but from the Prophaneness and Atheism of their hearts? <HI>Psal.</HI> 14. 1, 2. So as for all those that live in any scandalous sins against the first or second Table of the Law, it is cer|tain that they are not converted.

The Pharisee was <HI>no Extortioner, nor Unjust, nor an Adulterer, nor like the Pub|lican;</HI> and yet for all that, in his natural, unconverted estate, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 11. <HI>Paul</HI> be|fore his <HI>conversion,</HI> was <HI>touching the righte|ousness of the Law blameless,</HI> Phil. 3. 6. They therefore that bless themselves in their condition, only because none can say to them, that black is their eye, or charge them with any scandalous miscarriages in their lives, are in an unconverted estate. 4. <HI>So likewise are they all whose Religion is nothing else but Education.</HI> Alas, there are many that are deceived with this; all their Religion is the meer impression of a godly Education, without any special work of the holy Spirit upon their Souls. Not but that a Religious Education is a great mer|cy, yea, and to many of the Elect it is the great means of their conversion. But when Education alone is rested in, with|out experience of a regenerating work of the Spirit, then a man's case is sad. There 
<PB N="48" REF="000374_0051_0FA55A5479BE8820">
are, that because they were born of chri|stian Parents, and baptized, and when grown up, profess the Christian Religion which they have been educated in there|fore they think that they need no other conversion. Like that <HI>Prelate,</HI> who when one was convented before him for going to hear out of his Parish Church; the man alledging; that the reason why he did it, was, because the Minister whom he went to hear, was the instrument of his conver|sion, and therefore he could not but love to hear him Preach. <HI>How</HI> (said the Pre|late) <HI>Converted by him! Wert thou a Jew, or wast thou a Turk, that thou shouldst talk of Conversion? Art thou born an</HI> English|man, <HI>and a</HI> Christian, <HI>and dost thou speak of</HI> Conversion? Thus, I say, many Christians are like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who thought that the Doctrine of Conversion amongst the Jews that were by Education and Profession the People of God, was a strange Doctrine, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 5, 6, 7. There are many Christians that have no Religion or Conversion, but such, as if they had been brought up a|mongst <HI>Jews,</HI> they would have been <HI>Jews;</HI> 
<PB N="49" REF="000374_0052_0FA55A55358E4420">
if amongst <HI>Mahomotans,</HI> or <HI>Papists,</HI> they would have been so too; only through the efficacy of Education, in conjunction with natural Devotion, they make some shew of Christianity, without ever expe|riencing the saving operations of the holy Spirit in their hearts, whereas he that is converted indeed is <HI>born of the spirit,</HI> John 3. 6.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>They all, whose Religion is, in being of this or that perswasion,</HI> are in an un|converted estate. True it is, that Men must be of a right perswasion and belief in the Fundamental Points of the Chri|stian Faith, or they cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven. But though <HI>Ortho|doxy</HI> in respect of <HI>Judgment,</HI> be necessary, yet it is not sufficient unto Salvation: Ne|vertheless, there are some Christians, that if we take from them <HI>this or that particu|lar Opinion</HI> in some lesser points, all their Religion is gone. This is sad; what saith the Scripture? <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 15. <HI>In Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision, but a new creature:</HI> So that a man may be of that <HI>Party</HI> or <HI>Perswasion</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="000374_0053_0FA55A55F32DAB58">
which are for Circumcision, or of that Party or Perswasion that are against Cir|cumcision, and yet not be a new creature. If therefore all a mans Religion lieth in this, that he is for or against Circumcisi|on, the case is sad with him: for he is no new creature; no true Convert. Some there are, that their Souls are undone with the <HI>Monopoly of an Opinion,</HI> their Re|ligion is all in parties. And Oh that there were not need to speak of this amongst us also! Some, if they be of the <HI>Anaba|ptist</HI> Perswasion, here's all their Religion; others, if they be <HI>Independents</HI> (as the World speaks) here's all their Religion; others, if they be against this or that Su|perstition, here's all their Religion. Alas, alas! Conversion doth not consist in these matters only; if therefore these things be the main of ones Religion, that's a sure sign, that his conversion was slight and o|verly, and that he hath not attained to that sound <HI>and through conversion,</HI> which the Text and Doctrine speaketh of.</P>

unconverted Souls. Know then, 1. <HI>That as long as thou art unconverted, all the sins that ever thou didst commit in thy life, remain un-pardoned.</HI> Hence is that, Mark 4. 12. <HI>Lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins forgiven them.</HI> So that sins are not forgiven, except there be conver|sion: therefore thy Soul is in a miserable case; for any one of thy sins, though it were the least sin that ever thou didst commit in thy life, yet if it remain un|pardoned, the guilt of it is enough to sink thy soul down into the bottomless Pit: What then is like to become of thee, since all thy sins, thy numberless sins, thy great sins, ly in bank against thy Soul; not so much as one of them forgiven? 2. <HI>An unconverted sinner hath no Friend:</HI> he hath no Friend in Heaven; God, in whose fa|vour is life, is an Enemy to such a sinner: <HI>Natural Men</HI> are called the <HI>Enemies of God,</HI> Rom. 5. 10. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 21.

For, 3. <HI>Thou dost no|thing else but sin against God:</HI> An uncon|verted sinner never thought one good thought, nor spake one good word, nor did one good action before God in all his life: his civil actions are sins, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21. 24. <HI>The ploughing of the wicked is sin:</HI> So his natural Actions, his eating and drinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is sin: nay, his Religious actions are sins, his praying, and hearing, and fasting, and reading, all are so many sinful abomi|nations in the Lords sight, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 9 <HI>&amp;</HI> 28. 9. <HI>Psal.</HI> 109. 7. A natural man may do and speak, and think many things, which for the matter of them are good; but as done by such a person as is out of Christ they are not good, but evil in the sight of God.

sadly of it: canst thou make light of this that look how many actions there have been done by thee in all thy life time, how many words thou hast spoken, how many thoughts have been in thy heart, so many sins art thou guilty of, and must one day answer for them all! Lastly, <HI>Thou art in a state of death and condemnation.</HI> A natu|ral man <HI>is dead in trespasses and sins,</HI> Eph. 2. 1. A poor sinner hath all the miserable properties of a dead man belonging to him. As now a dead man cannot stir or go, so it is with a sinner, he cannot walk in the ways of God; one that's dead can|not hear, so a sinner is deaf to all the calls of Heaven. The Lord giveth many a loud knock and call, yet the sinner heareth nothing; the reason is, because he is dead. Again, a dead man cannot speak; so it is with a sinner, he hath no ability for spi|ritual discourse: This is the reason why some of you live in the neglect of Prayer. The Word hath told you many time, that you must pray in your Families, and in your Closets too, and you go with con|vinced Consciences that this is your duty, 
<PB N="54" REF="000374_0057_0FA55A58F49E46A0">
and yet you do it not; why? you say you cannot: I would pray in my Family, but I cannot. Alas poor creature, I be|lieve thee; for thou art dead in sins, and how should a dead creature speak unto God in Prayer? Yea, and an unconverted sinner is not only under spiritual Death for the present, but he remains under a sad Sentence of eternal Death, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 18. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already:</HI> Its not only true, that he shall be con|demned hereafter, but he is so already. The Sentence of death is <HI>already</HI> pronoun|ced against him, and shall as certainly be executed upon him, <HI>if he turn not,</HI> as if it were <HI>already</HI> done. Oh consider and trem|ble at it, all you that live in sin. I must tell you, for I should not be able to hold up my head before the Son of God ano|ther day, if I should forbear to <HI>tell you</HI> the truth; and therefore I <HI>tell you plainly</HI> and <HI>truly;</HI> If any person amongst you, man or woman, be they high or low, rich or poor, shall not turn from sin, yea, and from all sin, Eternal death shall as certain|ly be your portion, as if you were already in Hell.</P>

<HI>Use</HI> III. Let such a solemn Truth as this, put us upon serious and impartial <HI>Examination</HI> about this point, whether we be indeed converted or no. Sure it is no wisdom for us to let a matter of such mo|mently at uncertainties; yet such mad|ness is in the hearts of many of the Sons of men, that they go on carelesly, al|though if they should die in their present condition, they know not whither their Souls must for Heaven, or for Hell, as not minding whether they be in a converted, or an unconverted estate.

<P>You'll say, <HI>But how shall we know whe|ther we be converted or no?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. Try by that Character which the Text doth afford; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That convert|ed persons <HI>become as little Children.</HI> Look, as little Children are come into a World, where they never were afore; so tis in Conversion, the Soul <HI>begins the World anew,</HI> as it were, and the sinner leads a new life which before he was not acquainted 
<PB N="56" REF="000374_0059_0FA55A5DEFD9D120">
with. Hence is that Expression, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 4. <HI>Walk in newness of life.</HI> Particularly, there are divers properties in little Children, which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t forth a converted person: <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Humbleness of mind:</HI> A Child hath no ambitions high designs in his heart, on|ly minds lesser matters. Hence <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 131. 1. 2. <HI>Lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I ex|ercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me: Surely I have behaved my self as a child that is wearied, my soul is as a weaned Child. David</HI> was accused, as if he had had ambitious aspirings after <HI>Saul's</HI> Kingdom; But, saith he, I am as free from those Imputations as a Child that is but a|weanling, who hath no such aspirings in his thoughts. Now this humbleness of mind, is a special thing intended in the Text by conversion. Unmortified Pride is a soul-damning sin: yet there is no sin more natural, or more hard to subdue than Pride; its the first that liveth, and the last that dieth. Hence the work of conversion is well expressed in the Text, by the mortification of that one lust. 
<PB N="57" REF="000374_0060_0FA55A5F358D51F0">
And oft in the Scripture, a <HI>natural man</HI> &amp; a <HI>proud man</HI> are the same, <HI>Mal.</HI> 4. 1. and a converted man, and an humble man are also the same, <HI>Jam</HI> 4. 6. <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 14. <HI>He that humbles himself shall be exalted.</HI> That humbling noteth Conversion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A Child is teachable and tractable:</HI> A Child is far more easily brought under Discipline, than an elder person that was never used to it. Thus it is with a <HI>Convert:</HI> He is become marvellous teachable, ready to be led with the Word and Spirit of God: It is said of such, <HI>Isai.</HI> 11. 6. <HI>A little child shall lead them</HI> Now then <HI>consider,</HI> will the least Word of God aw you, and lead you this way or that way? Though the Instrument be never so contemptible, yet if he bring Scripture along with him, doth the Authority of that carry you before it, this is a good Sign.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Children are apt to forget wrongs:</HI> Hence is that, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 20. <HI>in malice be ye Children.</HI> You often observe that Chil|dren, though they fall out never so, yet in a little time all will be forgotten, and they will become as good friends as ever they 
<PB N="58" REF="000374_0061_0FA55A5FC33B50F8">
were. Truly, he that cannot forgive wrongs, hath no Grace in his heart; so if a man hath a <HI>forgiving spirit,</HI> its a good sign; yea, if a man doth freely forgive those that wrong him, and if he doth it out of conscience to the holy Command|ment of God, and out of a sence of the Grace of God towards him, in pardoning of his many sins, it is one of the clearest Evidences of a true Child of God that can be given. This hath Christ taught us, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 14, 15. <HI>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also for|give you: But if you forgive them not their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses.</HI> So that you see it holds true both in the Affirmative, and in the Negative, That <HI>a forgiving spirit</HI> is an evidence of a true child of God; and the want of this, an evidence of the con|trary. But besides these Characters which the Text doth afford, some other things may be mentioned as marks of <HI>Trial</HI> here Therefore.</P>

heard in opening the point, how conver|sion doth imply an universal change: Is it so with you? have you new heads, new hearts, new words, new thoughts, new lives and all? Moreover, the change wrought in <HI>conversion</HI> is universal, in re|spect of entire obedience unto all Divine commands, and an utter forsaking of every false way. Therefore it is said, <HI>the fruit of the spirit is in</HI> [All] <HI>goodness,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 9. Where the spirit hath wrought grace there is <HI>all</HI> goodness: Such a Soul doth practise <HI>all</HI> duties, and forsake <HI>all</HI> sins. It is indeed the greatest change that men are subject to. It is a marvelous change which death brings along with it; hence <HI>Job</HI> calls <HI>his death his change:</HI> It is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y way of eminency; <HI>Job</HI> 14. 14. But <HI>Conversion</HI> brings a greater change with it: For at death the change is only in respect of place and degree, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in <HI>Conversion</HI> there's a change wrought in respect of state and kind, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 8. <HI>Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are light in the Lord.</HI> There are new and quite contrary qualities wrought in the Soul, so as the sinner Converted 
<PB N="60" REF="000374_0063_0FA55A6138364628">
differs as much from the sinner Uncon|verted, as light differs from darkness. For,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If a man be converted, then his nature is changed;</HI> therefore such are said <HI>to par|take of the divine nature,</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 4. Such an one doth not only new acts, but there is in him a new nature, from whence these <HI>acts</HI> do proceed. He hath not only new <HI>practises,</HI> but a new <HI>Principle.</HI> Hence it is in some sort <HI>unnatural</HI> for a converted man to Sin, that is, so far forth <HI>as he is Regene|rate,</HI> 1 Joh. 3. 9. <HI>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God</HI> And it is natural unto him to do good and to endeavour to please God. Hence <HI>Paul</HI> saith to the <HI>Philippians</HI> concerning <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> that he <HI>did naturally care for their e|state,</HI> Chap. 2. V. 20. This was, because <HI>Timothy</HI> was a <HI>converted gracious man,</HI> and so a new nature was conferred upon him. Had it not been for converting Grace, such <HI>a care as that was,</HI> had never been natural to him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>You may try whether you are converted, by that spiritual Combat which is peculiar to 
<PB N="61" REF="000374_0064_0FA55A6203D44920">
the Regenerate.</HI> It is with a Child of God, as it was with <HI>Rebecca,</HI> in whom there was a <HI>Jacob</HI> and an <HI>Esau;</HI> or <HI>as it was</HI> with the house of <HI>Abraham,</HI> where there was an <HI>Isaac</HI> and an <HI>Ishmael:</HI> So it is with the heart of a Christian, there is a regenerate and un-regenerate part conflicting and combating, the one against the other, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17. Now if there be Spirit lusting a|gainst the Flesh, that is a sure sign that there is Spirit; only there is a <HI>dangerous delusion</HI> here, which many deceive them|selves with; they take the Reluctancy of a natural enlightned Conscience against Sin, to be the spiritual Combat, which is peculiar to the Regenerate, but these dif|fer much. As to the ground of the oppo|sition, there is a difference, the one oppo|seth Sin, because of the <HI>vileness and filthi|ness of its nature;</HI> the other only, or chief|ly for fear of punishment. It may be il|lustrated by this familiar Comparison: Some men are loth to meddle with coals of fire, because of filth which is about them; others never stick at it, only because of fire, lest haply their fingers should be 
<PB N="62" REF="000374_0065_0FA55A65383C8BA0">
burnt, they are loth to meddle: So it is here, a Natural man would never fall our with sin, because of the filth of it, only there's fire in sin, which would burn his Conscience, if he should meddle with it, and therefore he forbears some <HI>acts</HI> of sin; but the sincere Convert <HI>is acted</HI> from ano|ther Principle. There is also a difference as to the evils opposed; for when the con|flict is only from an enlightned Consci|ence, the evils opposed are wont to be more <HI>gross</HI> and <HI>vile;</HI> but in the spiritual combat, seemingly little <HI>Sins</HI> are mourn|ed under, even vain thoughts are a weari|some burthen. In the one, only some sins are opposed; in the other, all sin. So likewise there is wont to be a difference, in respect of the continuance of the oppo|sition: that which proceeds only from an enlightned conscience is wont to be but now and then, perhaps when some gross sin hath been committed, or the like; but the spiritual Combat is constant, and with|out intermission.</P>

I have sometimes put you in mind of an Expression of Mr. <HI>Bolton's,</HI> who said, <HI>He would not be in the condition of an unconvert|ed man one hour, though he might have all the World for it, lest haply death should come upon him in that hour, and so Repen|tance be too late.</HI> Oh methinks, I would not be in my Natural, unconverted estate again one moment, though I might have ten thousand Worlds for it, lest Death 
<PB N="64" REF="000374_0067_0FA55A6909C0FA90">
should seize upon me in a moment, and so my immortal Soul be lost. Think sadly of it, you that know not what the new Birth meaneth: if Death should find thee in thy present condition, it had been bet|ter for thee never to have been born; bet|ter for you never to have been born, than not to be <HI>new born;</HI> yea, it had been better for thee to have been a Dog, or a Toad, or a Serpent, or the vilest Creature in the World, than to dy in a natural, unconvert|ed estate: for these doleful Creatures when they die, see an end of their misery; but when thou diest, thy misery begins; when once thy immortal Soul is out of thy <HI>B</HI>o|dy, thy <HI>endless and easeless woes</HI> will come upon thee, without any hope of remedy. 2. One word more I must needs say unto you; and therefore be it known unto you, that if any of you will venture on still in your trespasses, <HI>so as to dy in your sins, your blood shall be upon your own heads.</HI> I Re|member what the Lord said to his Pro|phet, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3. 17, 18, 19. <HI>Son of man, I have made thee a Watchman unto the house of Is|rael, therefore hear the word at my mouth, 
<PB N="65" REF="000374_0068_0FA55A6A295B2C68">
and give them warning from me: When I say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die, and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his ini|quity, but his blood will I require at thine hand: yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.</HI> Now then let me deliver my Soul this day; Behold I do here in the Name of the Lord solemn|ly and earnestly warn every sinner a|mongst you, that you make haste to turn unto God in Jesus Christ; and I declare to you, that if you do it not, you shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. God before whom I stand, and holy An|gels that are here present, and all this As|sembly, shall bear me witness at the last day, that warning was given to you: Now if you will not take the warning, at your peril be it. And I have rejoycing in my own soul, that this is not the first time that I have given you warning, but many a time, yea, without ceasing, for the space 
<PB N="66" REF="000374_0069_0FA55A6A3B5A2EF0">
of these ten years, that the Lord hath up|held me amongst you, you have been told of these things. Now I call Heaven and Earth to record this day, that I have set before you Life and Death; therefore <HI>chuse Life, else your blood will be upon your own heads.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But some will say, <HI>We cannot convert our selves:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Yet observe these two Rules:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Put away all vain thoughts of being in a good estate already.</HI> Many might have been converted, if they had not ta|ken up with a false and groundless per|swasion of their being in a good and con|verted estate already: This was the ruin of the Jews and Pharisees especially, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 2, <HI>ult.</HI> Remember that conviction of mi|sery, is the first step towards Conversion. We see it in the Prodigal, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15. 17. he cried out, <HI>I perish;</HI> Thou must see that thou hast <HI>a perishing, dying, damning Soul,</HI> and then there's hopes of a right Conver|sion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Go to God for converting Grace,</HI> say as <HI>Ephraim did,</HI> Jer. 31. 18. <HI>Turn thou me and I 
<PB N="67" REF="000374_0070_0FA55A6B12EDE2E0">
shall be turned:</HI> And go and pray, as for thy life and soul, which lies at stake until the Lord convert thee. Suppose thou wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> condemned to die a natural death; if the Judge should tell thee, if thou would pray and beg hard for thy life, thou shouldst have it: Oh how wouldst thou pierce the Heavens with thy cries: So it is here, thou art condemned to die an e|verlasting death; nevertheless, the Lord saith, if thou wilt pray and seek to him for life, the Sentence may yet be reversed. Therefore do thus before thy Decree bring forth, <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe usual method observed by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistles, is, first 
<PB N="68" REF="000374_0071_0FA55A6BB6616300">
to discourse Doctrinally, and then Practi|cally; and so he doth in this Epistle to the <HI>Colossians.</HI> The two first Chapters are Doctrinal, and the two last are Practical.</P>
<P>This Chapter then doth contain matter of Exhortation unto duty: 1. We have a special <HI>Oeconomical</HI> Precept, even a rule con|cerning Houshold-Government, (which in the former Chapter the Apostle had been speaking of, <HI>ver.</HI> 1. 2. He lays down sundry general <HI>Moral Precepts</HI> which con|cern Christians, in whatever state or rela|tion they may stand in.</P>
<P>And here the Apostle doth Exhort: 1. To the practice of that great duty of prayer, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and in special that they would pray for him, <HI>ver.</HI> 3, 4. 2. He exhorts unto Christian Wisdom. And this is the scope of this verse, in which we have three things 1. The duty exhorted unto, namely, wise walking, <HI>Walk in Wisdom,</HI> that is, caute|lously and circumspectly, as it is expressed by the same Apostle, writing to the <HI>Ephe|sians,</HI> ch. 5. <HI>v.</HI> 16. 2. We have the object of this duty, <HI>towards them that are without,</HI> that is Infidels, who are out of the

Pale of the visible Church. The Church is compared to an House, hence they that are of the Church, are said to be <HI>within,</HI> that is, within doors, in respect of that sacred House of the Church; and they that do not belong to the visible Church, are described to be <HI>without,</HI> that is, they are not admitted within doors, but are kept out of the Temple.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is that which is the special work and evidence of this wisdom, name|ly, <HI>to redeem the time,</HI> which are the words, that by Gods help, we are to speak of.</P>
<P><HI>Time</HI> is sometimes taken for space of time. Sometimes it is taken for <HI>opportu|nity of time;</HI> it is the same with <HI>Season.</HI> It may be taken both wayes here, and e|specially in the latter sense; for the Greek word is not <GAP DESC="foreign"> the usual word for time, but <GAP DESC="foreign"> which signifieth Season or Op|portunity. The <HI>Doctrine</HI> which the words do afford unto, is this, 
<Q><HI>That it is a great part of Christian Wis|dom, timely to improve Opportunities and Seasons of Grace.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="000374_0073_0FA55A6DA8610940">
Intending to dispatch the point at this time, we shall in the Doctrinal prosecuti|on of it, only speak to two things. 1. What those seasons are which ought to be improved. 2. What is implied in re|deeming seasons of Grace; or when a man may be said to redeem the time.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What are those seasons which ought to be improved?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. <HI>A mans life time</HI> in this world is to be improved: Thus Christ hath taught us by his own <HI>unerring Example, Joh.</HI> 9. 4. <HI>I must work while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> A mans life is but a season, even a day which shall have a night to follow it; and therefore it is to be improved: Yea, and it is but a short season, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 30. <HI>The time is short.</HI> He that hath longest to live, yet hath but a short time to be in this world; therefore <HI>James</HI> saith, <HI>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away,</HI> Chap. 4. ver. 14. and <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Behold thou hast made my dayes an hand-breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee,</HI> Psal. 39. 5. A mans time in this 
<PB N="71" REF="000374_0074_0FA55A6F593500C0">
World is as nothing before God, that is to say, as nothing in comparison of Eterni|ty; therefore this time ought so much the more carefully and diligently to be improved; and it may be, a mans time is much shorter than himself doth think for. We read of one in the Gospel that was so foolish, as to dream of many years, when|as he had not so much as one day to live: He said he had goods for many, not only dayes, but years, whenas before the next day, his Soul was taken from him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 20. Besides, when a mans life is once gone, it is irrecoverable, men must die, and out of this World they shall go, and yet they <HI>die but once,</HI> Heb. 9. 27. <HI>It is appoint|ed for men</HI> [Once] <HI>to die;</HI> When once men are dead, <HI>the places that have known them, shall know them no more; the eyes that have seen them, shall see them no more; and the ears that have heard them, shall hear them no more.</HI> And thence if men do not improve their time whilest they are alive in the World, they lose their season for e|ver. When death is come, it is then too late to improve time; therefore <HI>Hezekiah</HI> 
<PB N="72" REF="000374_0075_0FA55A6F874F4AC8">
saith, <HI>they that go down into the pit, cannot hope for thy truth,</HI> Isai. 38. 18. When a mans body is gone down into the pit of the Grave, and his Soul is gone into the pit of Hell, he is past hope, and past help; he cannot hope for Gods mercy, and cannot hope for pardon of sin, he cannot hope for the salvation of his Soul: There|fore life-time is to be improved:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Times set a part for the solemn Worship of God are carefully to be improved</HI> Chri|stians ought to redeem time from their particular, to attend the duties of their general calling; they ought not to serve themselves only, but they must look to it, that they allow themselves time also for the service of God. It is true, that some are so much in the outward performance of Religious duties, as that they do there|by intrench upon their particular callings, spending more time in outward Worship, than any rule of God doth require, or al|low them to do: So the <HI>Heretical Euchites</HI> of old, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the greatest part of men err on the other hand, in allowing too little time, rather than too much, for the performance of sacred duties. But it is a 
<PB N="73" REF="000374_0076_0FA55A70CBEF09D8">
great point of Christian wisdom, to order things aright about this matter; so as that neither a mans particular calling may intrench upon his general calling as a Christian, nor yet his general upon the particular. I say, that time must be allow|ed for the worship of God. A man may not neglect the Worship of God, either in his Family, or in his Closet, or in the pub|lick Assemblies of his people, out of pre|tence that he wants time; rather let a man deny himself time to sleep, nay time to eat and drink, than not to take time to Pray, and to serve God. Moreover, when a man is worshipping God in any duty, such a season is very heedfully to be im|proved, else the Lords Name will be ta|ken in vain; and men instead of serving and pleasing God, will provoke him to displeasure by an heedless serving of him. And in special the Lords day is a season of Grace which ought to be improved, that's the day appointed to solemnize the Name and Worship of God in Christ amongst men, to the end of the World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 118. 24. <HI>This is the day which the Lord hath made 
<PB N="74" REF="000374_0077_0FA55A71356E6FB0">
we will rejoyce in it:</HI> the day of Christs Resurrection, which was upon the first day of the week, even this very day is to be observed in commemoration of the resur|rection and Redemption of Christ: <HI>This is the Day,</HI> which above others, ought to be prized and improved: It is a Market day for the Soul, and therefore to be re|deemed. Besides, if men take hold of op|portunities, to attend there where God is worshipped, they come where the Lord himself cometh, and thence may hope for a blessing: In which respect such seasons should earnestly be laid hold on, You read in the fifth of <HI>John,</HI> concerning an impotent man that lay waiting at the Pools of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> and Christ finding him there, he was healed: Had not the man layen at the Pools of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> Christ had not found him there; and had not Christ found him there, he had not been healed. Now the Ordinances of God are the pools of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> if Christ find men there, who knoweth but that Grace and life may be given into their Souls; but if they be not there, they keep themselves out of the way of a blessing.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="75" REF="000374_0078_0FA55A72BB046218">
3. <HI>The time of presperity</HI> is a season which ought to be well improved: Thus you find <HI>David</HI> calling upon the Princes of <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 Chron. 22. 11, 18, 19. <HI>Is not the Lord your God with you? hath he not given you rest on every side? now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God.</HI> It is (saith he) a prosperous season with you, and therefore now be looking after God, and the things of God; and indeed this is the most commodious season. Hus|bandmen you know will take the season whilest the Sun shineth, and the weather is favourable, to be gathering in the fruits of the Earth: So if men would be laying in for Eternity, if they would be laying up in store for themselves a good Foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of Eternal Life, it will be their Wisdom to improve the time of prospe|rity in order thereunto. As now, if God give unto a man a time of health and strength, let him improve it, in order to making his peace with God, and promo|ting the eternal welfare of his own Soul. Thus the Holy Ghost by <HI>Solomon</HI> doth ex|hort 
<PB N="76" REF="000374_0079_0FA55A7331E767E8">
hort, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>Remember thy Creator;</HI> Ay, but when? When old age cometh; or when sickness and death cometh, but never before that; so the carnal heart saith, and so the Devil saith, but the Lord teacheth otherwise; therefore it is added, <HI>In the days of thy youth, while the evil dayes come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.</HI> The evil dayes of sickness, or the troublesome years of old age will come upon you; but see that you remember to make your peace with God before those dayes come. So again, if the Lord bestow upon a man an estate, and cause him to prosper in the World in that respect, let him improve this, to honour God with his substance, and wisely make unto himself friends in Heaven, with the unrighteous Mammon of this World. And truly if men do neglect such seasons, they have no reason to expect other, but that God will deprive them of them, and alter the tenour of his gracious dispensations towards them. As it was said to <HI>Hesther, Who knoweth whe|ther thou art come to the Kingdom for such a 
<PB N="77" REF="000374_0080_0FA55A7597772038">
time as this? if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, thou and thy Fathers house shall be destroyed,</HI> Esth. 4. 14. So I say, who knoweth but that the Lord hath given men health and wealth, and prospered them here and there in the World, that so they might improve these mercies and good things, to the honour of him that gave them, and for their own spiritual and eter|nal comfort: If therefore they altogether neglect this season, let them look that God will blast their estates, and smite them with sickness, yea, and that a worse thing shall be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al them. Nevertheless,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The time of Adversity</HI> is a season which ought likewise to be improved: Hence, this Apostle saith, <HI>Redeem the time, because the dayes are evil,</HI> Eph. 5. 16. The times were then as they are now. It was in the Apostles dayes a time of Persecution and suffering to the People of God, therefore he calls that time an evil day: Now in this season, time was to be redeemed: the worse the times are, the better Christians ought to be; if the times be very bad, Christians ought to be very good:</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="000374_0081_0FA55A770124EC48">
Hence also is that 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 2. <HI>Preach the Word, be instant in season, and out of season.</HI> In season, is in time of prosperity; out of season is a time of Adversity, when a man cannot Preach, nor hear a Sermon, with|out incurring danger; yet such times must be improved to be doing and receiving good. If the times be bad, then the Lord threatens men, to deprive them of seasons of Grace, and in that respect there is the more need to improve them. And this is a special thing intended by the Apostle in the Text, <HI>Walk in wisdom redeeming the time:</HI> Shew your wisdom (saith he) by making the best of a bad Market. As wise Merchants, if the times be bad, will be more wary; if Trading be dead and low, they will be loth to venture upon a bad bargain, or to let slip the advantage of a good Bargain. Thus should men deal as to their Souls; as for seasons of Grace, they should see that they husband them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, especially when the Lord is threatning to take them away.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Times of being in company and converse with others, ought to be improved.</HI> Such 
<PB N="79" REF="000374_0082_0FA55A78AF3FEAB0">
times should be improved for the recei|ving of spiritual good: It is said, <HI>He that walks with the wise, shall be wise,</HI> Prov. 13. 20. If a man doth fall into the company of such as are godly and wise, he hath now an opportunity put into his hands to get wisdom; he might propound many pro|fitable Questions, which he is not able to resolve himself, but one that God hath gi|ven a greater measure of wisdom and un|derstanding unto, could soon resolve him, had he an heart to improve such an op|portunity. Again, such times should be improved for doing good, that is, by ho|ly conference and exhortations unto the thing that good is; as we see in the Con|text, <HI>Redeem the time,</HI> saith the Apostle; and then the very next words are, <HI>let your speech be alwayes with Grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to an|swer every man,</HI> Col. 4. 6. So that that's one way of improving time aright, even by gracious and savoury Discourses. The neglect of this is the great sin of many Professors: Alas, how is it, as if <HI>holy Con|ference</HI> were banished out of the World?
<PB N="80" REF="000374_0083_0FA55A79353F0AE0">
Christians meet together, and much dis|course passeth about this or the other mat|ter, but it may be not one edifying word all the while: But what saith the Scri|pture? <HI>Exhort one another daily,</HI> Heb. 3. 13. As you have opportunity of daily converse you should take occasion to exhort and call upon one another, and say, how is it with you as to spirituals? have you got as|surance yet? do you grow in Grace? how is it with your Soul, doth that prosper?</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Solitary times are also to be improved&punc;</HI> I say not only times of being in company, but times of being alone, are to be impro|ved. Such seasons should be made use of for Prayer. Meditation, and Self-Examina|tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We read concerning <HI>Nathaniel</HI> that Christ said to him, <HI>When thou wast un|der the fig-tree, I saw thee;</HI> Joh. 1. 48. though no mortal eye beheld him, yet the Son of God that hath eyes like a Flame of fire looked upon him there: Jesus Christ who is God as well as man, saw <HI>Nathaniel</HI> when he was alone under the fig-tree: Indeed it is not said what <HI>Nathaniel</HI> was doing there; but it is very probable, that he was
<PB N="81" REF="000374_0084_0FA55A79F637FD58">
praying or meditating, or about some such holy design, that Christ should take such special notice of him. So concern|ing <HI>Isaac,</HI> we read that he went out to <HI>me|ditate in the field,</HI> Gen. 24. 63. He retired himself into a solitary place, that so he might with the more freedom and conve|niency practise that much neglected, and get profitable duty of meditation. So for <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 32. 24. <HI>Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the break|ing of the day.</HI> He spent a good part of the night in secret Prayer, none being there present but Christ and he. Yea, Christ himself hath taught us this, by his own blessed Example, <HI>Mat.</HI> 14. 23. <HI>He went up into a mountain apart to pray, and when evening was come, he was there alone.</HI> And the truth is, that a time of privacy is the fittest season for holy converse and communion with God, because then a man may freely and fully open his whole heart to God. Men have their special Corruptions, which it is not fit the World should hear of; yea all that are Christians indeed, have their special and fore tempta|tions 
<PB N="82" REF="000374_0085_0FA55A7AB7D0DD38">
that do molest them; as for looser formal Professors, they may go on smooth|ly and easily; but as for such as have ta|ken up not only the form, but the power of Godliness, they meet with many rubs and difficulties, and strong assaults from the great Enemy of Salvation: Now se|cret places are the fittest to complain to the Lord in about these temptations therefore times of privacy, may and must be taken hold on by Christians for such an end.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The time wherein Gods Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> strive with men is to be improved.</HI> There are seasons wherein the holy Spirit is bles|sedly at work with the heart; now these are seasons which ought carefully to be improved. If men be to set sail, they must take the opportunity when the wind serveth: So if they would be setting Sail towards Heaven, they must observe the gales of the Spirit; they must lay hold on the opportunity, wherein the blessed brea|things of the Spirit are afforded to them. These should be improved in order to Re|pentance, lest hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y the spirit of the Lord 
<PB N="83" REF="000374_0086_0FA55A7B76547280">
do forsake a man, and give him up to the hardness of his own heart for ever; as you have lately heard that with some sinners it is so. And these Seasons ought to be improved for Prayer, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 18. <HI>Pray al|wayes,</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>in every season,</HI> as the Greek phrase is, <HI>watching thereunto,</HI> &amp;c. You must watch when the Spirit of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you up to Prayer, and then upon your knees, sometimes the Lord by his Spirit secretly moveth unto Prayer, yea, sometimes he puts the heart into a praying frame: Now that's a season of Grace which may not be neglected, without great danger to a mans Soul.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>The present time is that which should carefully be improved;</HI> So <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>Remember</HI> [Now] <HI>thy Creator.</HI> Men, e|specially young men, when they are cal|led upon to be mindful of God, and the things of God, and the great concern|ments of their Souls, are apt to put it off till <HI>tomorrow,</HI> or sometimes <HI>hereafter;</HI> but the Holy Ghost saith <HI>now.</HI> Mind this mat|ter without any further delays: Do not think to put off God with <HI>Excuses,</HI> or with 
<PB N="84" REF="000374_0087_0FA55A7C43485CD0">
<HI>Tomorrows,</HI> but the first thing you do, make sure of an interest in him. 2. <HI>Cor</HI> 6. 2, <HI>Behold now is the accepted time; Behold, now is the day of Salvation.</HI> Satan saith, and a self-deceiving heart saith, <HI>Tomorrow, tomorrow;</HI> but the Lord saith, <HI>Now, now:</HI> Yea, there is a <HI>double Behold</HI> added to it, <HI>Behold, behold, now, now</HI> is the time for you to look after your Salvation, if ever you desire to be saved. But of this more in the Application of the point.</P>
<P>We proceed therefore to the second thing, namely, to shew what is implied in redeeming seasons of Grace, or, <HI>When a man may be said to redeem the time?</HI></P>
<P>For answer to that, 1. Herein is im|plied, <HI>An heart to receive and do all the good that may be.</HI> Except there be an heart to receive Spiritual good when it is offered a man cannot be said to redeem time; a <HI>Solomon complains,</HI> Prov. 17. 16. <HI>Wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a price in the hand of a Fool to get Wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it.</HI> Sometimes it is so, that there is a precious Sermon preached at a mans door; If he would come and hear, who knoweth
<PB N="85" REF="000374_0088_0FA55A7F993AD8D8">
how much good might be done to his Soul: But he cometh not, and yet hath no sufficient Reason to excuse himself, on|ly <HI>he hath no heart to it;</HI> therefore he is not worthy to be accounted a <HI>Time Re|deemer.</HI> So again, there must be a heart to <HI>do good.</HI> As the Apostle Exhorts, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6. 10. <HI>As we have opportunity let us do good unto all men especially to them who are of the Houshold of Faith:</HI> When a man doth seriously and conscientiously think with himself, how may I improve my time and talent most to the honour of God, and the good of men, and comfort of my own Soul, in the great day, and doth accor|dingly; such an one doth <HI>redeem the time.</HI> Though a man should be providentially disappointed as to actual performance, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indeed he hath an heart to lay hold on opportunities of receiving or doing Spiri|tual good, he is a <HI>Time-Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Herein is implied <HI>Wisdom to discern of Times and Seasons.</HI> As it is said of the Children of <HI>Issachar,</HI> that they <HI>had under|standing of the times to know what Israel ought to do,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 12. 32. There is no

<Q><HI>That the true Fearers of God will be constant in the practice of that duty of Fami|ly Prayer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In order to the clearing of this Truth, there are three things to be enquired into.</P>
<P N="1">1. How it doth appear that Family Prayer is a duty?</P>
<P N="2">2. What is implied in being constant therein, or in doing thus alway?</P>
<P N="3">3. The Reasons why they that truly fear God do thus practice.</P>
<P>Q 1. <HI>How doth it appear that Family Prayer is a duty?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="000374_0110_0FA5598873D5F560">
<HI>Ans</HI> 1. <HI>The Scripture doth injoyn this.</HI> God in his Word, commands men to <HI>pray with all Prayer.</HI> Eph. 6. 18. Not only pray|er in Closets, and in solemn Assemblies, but in Families, is comprehended under that expression of <HI>All Prayer</HI> Nor can a Man be said to pray with <HI>all Prayer,</HI> ex|cept he doth practice publick, secret, and Family Prayer. And in the Scripture, Husbands and Wives are required to live lovingly together, <HI>that their prayers be not hindred,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 7. what Prayers? Surely Family Prayers. They that are contending and quarrelling one with ano|ther, are very unfit to go to Prayer toge|ther: Therefore Husband and Wife should live in love, that so they may not be in|disposed to pray together in their Family. Again, the Scripture declareth, that men should take care that their Families as well as themselves serve God. Fathers are to bring up their Children, in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 4. which they cannot do except they pray with them, and by example as well as pre|cept, let them see that God ought to be 
<PB N="108" REF="000374_0111_0FA55989A7DE5450">
worshipped and prayed unto. Thus <HI>Joshua</HI> was resolved to do, <HI>Chap.</HI> 24 <HI>v.</HI> 15. <HI>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua</HI> did exhort the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> that they should all of them in their Hou|ses serve God, which doth imply Prayer unto him; inasmuch as prayerless Fami|lies cannot be said to be God-serving God|fearing Families.</P>
<P N="2">2. As there are Scripture-precepts re|quiring this duty, so <HI>there are Scripture-Examples, which God hath caused to be Re|corded in his Word for our instruction and imitation.</HI> We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the Lord Christ, who hath le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t himself for an example in this as well as in other things, for us to follow; did pray with his Family, <HI>Luk</HI> 9. 18. <HI>As he was alone praying, his Disciples</HI> (who were his Family) <HI>were with him.</HI> And when Christ did keep the Passeover with his Domestick Disciples alone, it is certain that he prayed with them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 18. &amp;c. <HI>David</HI> also was wont to Worship God with his Family. And was resolved to continue in that practice all his days. Hence he could say, <HI>as Ps.</HI> 101. 2. <HI>I will walk with|in my house with a perfect heart</HI> And we 
<PB N="109" REF="000374_0112_0FA5598B93168538">
read concerning him, that after he had been attending the Worship of God in publick, <HI>he returned to bless his house,</HI> 1 Chr. 16. 43. so that he did not think it enough to Worship God in a publick solemn As|sembly amongst his People, but when he cometh home, he prayeth with his family, that the blessing of God might be there.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Of old thhere were not only publick but private Family Sacrifices. Jonathan</HI> relates concerning <HI>David</HI> that he said to him <HI>our Family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a Sacrifice in the City, and my Brother commanded me to be there,</HI> 1 Sam. 20. 29 which undoubtedly were not with|out Family Prayers. And although Sacri|fices in a legal, literal sense are ceased, in these dayes of the Gospel Christ by that one offering of himself, having put an end thereto, yet spiritual Sacrifices must be offered up still, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>Ye are a spiritual house, an holy Priest-hood to offer up spiritu|al Sacrifices, acceptable unto God by Jesus Christ.</HI> When Christians offer up prayers and praises unto the Lord, these are spi|ritual Sacrifices, acceptable unto God through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="000374_0113_0FA5598C872E41C0">
And indeed every Believer is a spiritual Priest. Jesus Christ <HI>hath made us Priests unto God and his Father&punc;</HI> Rev. 1. 6. And in|asmuch as he is a Priest in his own Fami|ly, therefore he ought to offer up spiritual Sacrifices there. Every Master of a Fa|mily is a Prophet in his own Family, be|cause he ought to instruct them in the things of God: and a King there, inas|much as he ought to govern his Family according to the Rules of the Word of God, and a Priest also, for that he ought to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices therein.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The very light of nature teacheth men that Family Prayer is a duty.</HI> Hence the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that had no Scripture to direct them, yet have made conscience of <HI>Fami|ly Worship.</HI> They had their <HI>Penates,</HI> hou|shold Gods, whom they did adore Yea, <HI>Mahometans</HI> at this day, Worship their god not only in publick Assemblies, but in their Families. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Men who call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> and yet acknowledg no God in their Families, are in that thing worse than <HI>Infidels.</HI> Many <HI>Heathen Peo|ple,</HI> nay <HI>Turks,</HI> will at the Day of Judg|ment 
<PB N="111" REF="000374_0114_0FA5598F62D7DC60">
rise up against such pretended Chri|stians, and condemn them.</P>
<P>Quest: 2. <HI>What is implied in a mans pray|ing</HI> [Alway] <HI>with his Family?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This Praying <HI>alway,</HI> implieth fre|quency in that duty. Family Prayer should be attended daily. In that sense the Phrase is sometimes used in the Scri|pture. As when he is said, that <HI>Mephibo|sheth</HI> did eat (<HI>continually,</HI> or as the He|brew word <HI>Tamid</HI> signifieth) <HI>alway</HI> at the Kings Table; the meaning is that it was his daily custom so to do. Thus <HI>Cornelius</HI> with his House prayed alway; Family Prayer was daily observed in that House-Families need daily supplies of mercy. And there are Family occasions to be attended every day, which Masters in Families are concerned to look up to God, that his bles|sing may be thereon: And there are dai|ly mercies which they ought to bless God for. Yea, it is good to practice this Du|ty more than once every day, <HI>h: e:</HI> in the Morning and in the Evening also. It is a good thing to praise the Lord, and shew forth his loving-kindness in the morning, 
<PB N="112" REF="000374_0115_0FA5598FF7C03F50">
and every evening, <HI>Psal.</HI> 92. 1, 2. The con|tinual offering under the Law was that whereby Prayer was typified: and that was to be both at morning and at the e|ven, <HI>Exod:</HI> 29: 38: <HI>Numb:</HI> 28: 3: 4: So should it be as to Family Prayer: And therefore it is very observable, that the Apostle speaking to <HI>Masters in Families,</HI> useth that expression, <HI>continue in Prayer,</HI> Col: 4: 2: In which words he doth evidently allude un|to the continual offering under the Law, which was to be attended daily, both at morning and at even; you (saith he) that are Masters of <HI>Families,</HI> forget not the continual offering of Prayer, which you ought to present before the Lord. It is as if he had said, pray constantly morn|ing and evening in your <HI>Families.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Expression implieth perseverance.</HI> Men should not only begin to practice this duty, but they ought to hold on there|in, all their dayes. Christ hath taught us <HI>that men ought alway to pray and not to faint</HI> Luk: 18: 1: And we are bid to <HI>pray with|out ceasing,</HI> 1 Thess: 5: 18: As there ought 
<PB N="113" REF="000374_0116_0FA559928C98FDA8">
to be perseverance in attending unto the publick Worship of God, on the times ap|pointed for that end: As <HI>Hezekiah</HI> pro|fesseth that he had taken up a resolution <HI>to praise God all the dayes of his life in the House of the Lord.</HI> Isai. 38. 20. So should Men praise the Lord, and pray to him all the dayes of their lives in their own hou|ses. There ought to be <HI>perseverance in all Prayer,</HI> and therefore Christians are to continue all their dayes in the practice of private or family, as well as in publick and in closet-prayer: So may they be said to do as <HI>Cornelius</HI> did, even to pray al|way, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 18.</P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>Whence is it that the true Fearers of God do thus?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because they that truly fear God respect the honour of his Name. They cannot but desire that God might be ho|noured every where, and more especially in their own Families. Now Prayer ho|nours God. Hence is that expression, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 8. <HI>They honour me with their lips:</HI> when men pray unto God with their lips, they honour him therewith: and when 
<PB N="114" REF="000374_0117_0FA55993B72D03E8">
they pray with their hearts, as well as their lips, they honour him with both. As when they neglect this so great a duty, they with-hold that honour from God, which is due unto him from his creatures, <HI>Isai</HI> 43. 23. <HI>Thou hast not honoured me with thy Sacrifices.</HI> So doth the Lord say to Masters of Families, that pray not with their Houses, thou hast not honoured me with thy Prayers. But as for those that call upon his Name, their Prayers and praises glorifie him. When men own the Lord to be the God of their Families they put honour upon him. And so it is when Family Worship is duely upheld.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. They that truly fear God, are desirous that the interest of Religion should be upheld and promoted. One that is truly Religious himself cannot but desire that others may be so too. <HI>Paul</HI> being himself a real Christian, earnestly wished that others were in that respect as he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> When <HI>Agrippa</HI> said to him, <HI>thou almost perswadest me to be a Christian,</HI> he re|plied, <HI>I would to God, that not only thou but also all that hear me this day, were both al|most 
<PB N="115" REF="000374_0118_0FA55993CEF7B5F8">
&amp; altogether such as I am, except these Bonds,</HI> Act. 26. 28, 29. So it is, (and can|not but be) where there is true Grace. Especially they are desirous that those who are related to them: and are of the same Family with them, may be acquainted with the good wayes of the Lord. There|fore they will make Conscience, not only to pray for them, but to pray with them; since thereby Religion and the Fear of God will be promoted. And to have Re|ligion in Families is the way to have it elsewhere. Families are the Nurseries of all Societies. If Religion should not be upheld there, it would fall to the ground every where.</P>
<P>USE I. <HI>For Reprehension:</HI> And there are many that fall under just and sad Re|proof from this Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. It condemns those that live in the total neglect of this duty of Family Pray|er. And what is like to come on prayer|less Families at last? Let prayerless Fa|thers, and prayerless Masters hear the Word of the Lord, and tremble at it. O that you would consider, how you expose 
<PB N="116" REF="000374_0119_0FA55994803C2E40">
not only your selves but Families, to the vengeance of Heaven. How often have you been put in mind of that awful Scri|pture, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10. 25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not.</HI> What's that to us? some one will be ready to say; we are no Heathen, we are all Christians: but mark what follows, <HI>and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name.</HI> Not only pro|fessed <HI>Heathen,</HI> but Families that live like <HI>Heathen</HI> without any prayer, the fury of the Almighty will come pouring down from Heaven upon them: Hence are tem|poral judgements upon Families many times. The Lord kills Children with death, because Parents do not shew them an example of Religion to pray with them in the Family as well as for them in secret. Yea, the Souls of your poor Children are ruined by this sin of yours. And O how sad will it be, when God shall require the <HI>blood of the Souls of Children,</HI> at the hands of their prayerless Fathers; and the blood of the Souls of Servants at the hands of their prayerless Masters. Think with your <HI>selves what answer you will make</HI> before Je|sus 
<PB N="117" REF="000374_0120_0FA559955956C160">
Christ the Son of God at the last and great day. If thy Children shall be thine ac|cusers before the Lord then; if any of them shall stand before the Lord Jesus in the day when he shall judge the World, and say, Lord, there is the man that was my Father, I never heard him pray in all my life, and that made me live in the ne|glect of God also; or if thy servants shal any of them say, Lord, there is the man that was my Master, I lived in his house so many moneths, but I never heard him praying unto God all that time, what an|swer wilt thou then make for thy self? you shal not be able to plead ignorance. For I will then call Heaven and Earth to re|cord against you, that you were often told of your duty in this particular. And yet I hear some say, that there are many pray|erless families in this great Town. The thing is lamentable, if it be so. What, for men that call themselves Christians, to have no prayer in their families? for men that live under the light of the Gospel, to live without Prayer in their families! for men that live in <HI>New-England,</HI> and 
<PB N="118" REF="000374_0121_0FA55995F42797D0">
that have lived in <HI>Boston,</HI> not so much as to pray in their families! Such have known to do good, and yet have not done it; therefore sin and guilt and wrath most fearful doth abide them. And this word reacheth Masters of <HI>Vessels</HI> that never pray with their Ships-Company, who are their family, with whom they ought to wor|ship God continually.</P>
<P N="2">2. This reproveth those that do not pray in their Families <HI>All way.</HI> There are some that pray in their families; but when is it? once in a week perhaps. It may be on the Sabbath day, they will pray in their families, and serve God therein no more all the dayes of the week after. Is this to pray <HI>alway</HI> when there are such wide and woful gaps in prayer? It is thy duty <HI>to serve God all the dayes of thy life.</HI> Luk. 1. 75. Dost thou serve God all thy dayes, when thou dost serve him, and pray to him, but one day in seven? God will not be put off so. When once thou shalt see the day wherein thy family shal stand in no need of God's blessing; neglect Prayer in thy family for that day; but til then willing|ly 
<PB N="119" REF="000374_0122_0FA55996B9965AF8">
omit it not under any pretence whatso|ever. And are there not some, that time was when they would worship God with their families; but they are fallen away, and have cast off the practice that is good? O foolish creatures, you did run well, but who hath driven you back? Remember the word that was spoken by the Lord Jesus, <HI>Luk.</HI> 9. 26. <HI>No man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God.</HI> Didst thou begin to pray with thy family? This was to set thy hand to the Lords Plough: Wo to thee if thou drawest it back again.</P>
<P N="3">3. This reproveth those who do that in families which is quite contrary unto pra|ying &amp; serving God therein. Are there not families in this place, wherein there is Drinking to excess, Gaming, wantonness, Uncleanness? Indeed, when such deeds of darkness are brought to light, they are put to shame amongst us; and it is a great mer|cy to the Land, that open prophaness and wickedness is punished, but the Lord seeth what is done in private Houses. He know|eth who they are that <HI>assemble themselves 
<PB N="120" REF="000374_0123_0FA5599A4314FC78">
by troops in the Harlots House; Jer.</HI> 5. 7. And are there not families in the which instead of Prayer, there is Cursing, Sweat|ing, Sabbath-breaking and the like Trans|gressions that provoke the glorious eyes of the Holy Majesty of Heaven? Let the Masters of such families look to themselves. For the Sabbath-breaking, and other pro|phanenesses that are indulged in their fa|milies will be charged upon them who ought to rule their houses better. <HI>Exo.</HI> 20. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Use.</HI> 2. Of Exhortation: <HI>To be constant in the practice of this necessary duty</HI> They that are so, their labour shal not be in vain in the Lord. If they be sincere therein, special mercy will follow: We see it in this example of <HI>Cornelius.</HI> He worship|ped God with his House, and prayed <HI>alway;</HI> and what special notice did the Lord take of him? those prayers were not lost. And sometimes when outward Judgements come, God sheweth peculiar mercy to praying families. I remember I have read of a Town in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> that was de|stroyed with an Earth-quake, excepting only one House, where it so sell out, that 
<PB N="121" REF="000374_0124_0FA5599AA9FE0FA0">
at the time when the Earth-quake happe|ned, the Master of the House was at pray|er with his family. But especially spiri|tual blessings, are wont to follow upon the sincere attendance unto this duty. If there be a praying Father, it is to be hoped that there will be praying Children: And if there be a praying Master, it is to be hop|ed there will be praying Servants. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not that a blessed thing for a man to have the Children and Servants of his own fami|ly praying for him continually? Thus do we read concerning <HI>Abrahams</HI> Servants, <HI>Gen</HI> 24. 12. He said, <HI>O Lord God of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my Master</HI> Abraham. How came <HI>Eliezer</HI> to be a praying Servant? doubtless, he ob|served that his Master was much in pray|er; and such an Example might be well followed.</P>
<P>I shall only answer two or three Ob|jections, and conclude.</P>
<P>Obj. 1. Some one may say, <HI>I have not time to pray in my Family.</HI> My business and worldly occasions are such as I can|not attend prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="000374_0125_0FA5599DC90927F8">
<HI>Ans.</HI> No man shall fare the worse as to his outward Estate, because he doth make conscience to set some time apart daily to serve God; no mans Family shall be the poorer, but rather the richer for that. O that you would remember and consider more on that Scripture, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 33. <HI>Seek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> first the Kingdom of God and his righte|ousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</HI> And it is certainly better to want time for other things, than to take no time to pray in. Yea, a man should rather de|ny himself a little of his natural rest and sleep, than to live an ungodly and pray|erless life. Nor is it needful, or indeed convenient, that Family duties should be ordinarily long and tedious; and there|fore the objection is a vain excuse. There are others in the World, that have as much business upon their hands as thou hast, who nevertheless can find time to pray in their Closets, and in their Families too. Had not <HI>David</HI> as little time to spare, and as much business to attend as any man can ordinarily pretend unto; yet he <HI>alwayes</HI> found time to pray in. Let thy Conscience 
<PB N="123" REF="000374_0126_0FA5599E32BCA9A8">
speak; canst thou not find time for other things that are of less concernment? thou canst find time it may be to sit in some Tavern, and there to discourse, the Lord knoweth about what. If that time which is spent in vain, unprofitable Discourse, were spent in Communion with God, it would be happy for thee. Canst thou find time for vain Discourse, and yet not find time for Prayer? and canst thou then think that God will ever find a time to save thy poor soul? deceive not thy self, thou must be another man, or that time will never come.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. <HI>I am ashamed to pray in my Fa|mily?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans,</HI> What ashamed to own God, and the Lord Jesus Christ! dost thou not know that that's the way for a man to lose his Soul for ever? see else what the Lord Je|sus hath spoken, <HI>Mark</HI> 8. 3. last verses. <HI>What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole World and lose his own Soul, or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul: whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sin|ful 
<PB N="124" REF="000374_0127_0FA559A0734BE5A0">
generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father, with the Holy Angels.</HI> If thou art ashamed of prayer, thou art ashamed to own the wayes of Christ: and then what will become of thy precious and immor|tal Soul?</P>
<P>Obj. 3. <HI>I would pray in my Family, but I cannot, I have not the gift of utterance and expression?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. 1. <HI>It is better for thee to make use of a form them not to pray at all.</HI> I confess, I look upon it as sinful to make use of those <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> which are taken out of the <HI>Popes Mass-Book,</HI> because in so do|ing men put too much honour upon an Idol. It is also true that the imposition of Forms of Prayer is unwarrantable; yet all use of Forms is not prohibited in the Scripture, witness the <HI>Form of Blessing</HI> therein expressed. Learned and judicious Mr. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> doth from <HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 35. conjecture, that ordinarily Christ used the same words in his <HI>Blessing at Meal-times,</HI> with his <HI>Domestick Disciples.</HI> Now there is no man of ordinary understanding, but 
<PB N="125" REF="000374_0128_0FA559A178D1BEF0">
he may attain unto a Form of Prayer; and he had better make use of that, than to live without any Worship of God at all in his Family. But I am far from perswa|ding you to take up with Forms.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Practice, and that will make you able.</HI> As in other things practice maketh men ready and able, so it is in respect of the gift of Prayer. Some that when they be|gan first to Pray, were able to make but poor work of it; by frequent practice have attained unto an excellent gift in Prayer. And there are some who com|plain they cannot Pray, whenas it is be|cause they do not practise. If they would set upon practice, God would be with them. And O that I could prevail with those of you, that make this Objection a|gainst praying in your Families; to go home and make trial. I am perswaded that if you would try, and set upon the practice of <HI>Family Prayer</HI> in earnest, the Lord God would be with you.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="126" REF="000374_0129_0FA559A1F5CAD408">
3. <HI>Labour for the true fear of God in your hearts.</HI> No man that truly fears God, but he can pray in some measure, as you heard from <HI>Psal.</HI> 32. 6. <HI>Every one that is godly shall pray.</HI> Grace will make a man sensible of his spiritual wants, and that will set him a praying. They that see themselves perishing will cry to God for Salvation. So it is with the godly man. Yea, where there is true grace, there will be Family Prayer. The Lord saith, <HI>He will pour upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace,</HI> and then <HI>Families, Fa|milies, would pray &amp; mourn apart,</HI> Zec. 12. 10.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Be much in secret Prayer:</HI> Go into thy closet; there beg for Grace; yea, pray for the Spirit of Prayer. That the Lord would be pleased to give his Holy Spirit unto you, and thereby enable you to pray. And by praying in thy closet, thou wilt be made able to pray with thy Family. So mayest thou become like to <HI>Coruelius,</HI> who <HI>feared God with all his house, and pray|ed alway.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in this Verse doth intimate two things:</P>
<P N="1">1. His own sincerity in serving God. He freely confesseth himself to be the Lords Servant, <HI>God whom I serve.</HI> And there are two expressions, both which may denote his sincerity therein. One is that of his serving God <HI>from his fore-fathers.</HI> He served the same God, and after the same manner that his fore-fathers had done. As for his immediate fore-fathers they were <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pharisees;</HI> and time was when he had served God as they had taught him: but those words may have respect to more remote Fathers, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The holy Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> &amp;c. Another expression denoting the A|postles 
<PB N="128" REF="000374_0131_0FA559A383D56E18">
sincerity, is, that of his serving God with a pure Conscience, which implieth that he was ever careful to act according to the Light of his Conscience; so indeed he was before his conversion unto Christ, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 1. It implieth also, that his heart was perified by Faith in the Lord Jesus. For only they have a pure Conscience in the sight of God who are purged from the guilt of sin, in the blood of Christ. It implieth moreover an holy conversation; a due respect both to first and second Ta|ble duties. Mens Consciences are wont to be according to their actions: evil actions will pollute the Conscience: yea, the expression imports inward as well as outward serving God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apostle in this verse, intimateth his love and affection unto <HI>Timothy.</HI> Both in that he did give thanks to God for him.

He saith in the next verse, <HI>I am mindful of thy tears.</HI> Probably in those words, he may have respect unto the tears which <HI>Timothy shed,</HI> at his part|ing with the Apostle, when he removed from <HI>Ephesus:</HI> and he did bless God for the Grace which he saw in <HI>Timothy;</HI> that there was <HI>Faith unfeigned in him, which dwelt first in his Grandmother Lois, and in his Mother Eunice,</HI> ver 5. We should bless God for the Grace we see in others, and especially in young men; <HI>Paul</HI> was now aged, and hastening out of the World; but he thanked God, when he saw that <HI>Timothy</HI> a young man did inherit the Gra|ces of his godly Predecessors. And he must needs rejoyce the more to see how Religion and the fear of God was propa|gated from Generation to Generation, e|ven to the third Generation.</P>
<P>Again, he testified his affection towards <HI>Timothy,</HI> by being abundant in Prayer for him. We find that this Apostle doth be|gin another Epistle after the same manner signifying his affection to those he wrote unto, by declaring how he did give 
<PB N="130" REF="000374_0133_0FA559A741A0B7B0">
thanks and pray in their behalf, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 8, 9. The Prayers here referred unto, must of necessity be understood of his secret Prayers. For we cannot in reason suppose that he did alwayes remember <HI>Timo|thy</HI> in publick, but in his secret addresses to the Throne of Grace; which shews that He was constant and conscionable in the <HI>practice</HI> of that sort of Prayer.</P>
<P>From which consideration the <HI>Doctrine</HI> is,
<Q><HI>That the sincere Servants of God, will make conscience to practise that duty of Secret Prayer, day and night without ceasing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are three things that may here be enquired into.</P>
<P N="1">1. How it doth appear that the sin|cere servants of God, will make consci|ence of <HI>practising</HI> that duty of secret prayer?</P>
<P N="2">2. What is implied in this expression of praying day and night without ceasing?</P>
<P N="3">3. The Reasons why Men especially sincere Christians should <HI>practise</HI> this duty.</P>
<P>Q 1. <HI>How doth it appear that the sin|cere Servants of God will make conscience of practising that duty of Family Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="000374_0134_0FA559A9B9633920">
Ans. <HI>The many Instances Recorded in the Scripture, concerning the faithful Servants of God, who have conscientiously practised this duty, are an evidence of the truth of this Doctrine.</HI> As to the great and essential du|ties of Religion, all that truly fear God, practise alike: As the Apostle doth here intimate, where he saith, <HI>I serve God from my fore-Fathers.</HI> A true Servant of God, will follow the pious Example of those that have gone before him walking in the same way of Holiness, which they have done, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 20. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 12. Now concerning this duty of Secret Prayer, we find many Examples (both in the Old Testament, and in the New) of the Lords Servants who have thus practised; and that as to all sorts of Men, Superiors, Inferiors, Fa|thers, Children, Masters, Servants, who have had the fear of God planted in their hearts; thus did <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18. 23. and <HI>Eliezer, Abraham's</HI> godly Servant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 24. 12. And <HI>Isaac</HI> his gracious Son; it is noted of him, <HI>ver.</HI> 63. <HI>That he went out to meditate;</HI> or (as the <HI>He brew</HI> word <HI>La|suach</HI> may be read) <HI>to pray.</HI> The word 
<PB N="132" REF="000374_0135_0FA559AA3551EAE8">
signifieth both to pray and to meditate, and it is not improbable but that <HI>Isaac</HI> did at that time, nothing but what was his daily custom to do, even retire himself from all company, for secret Prayer and meditation. And the like we read con|cerning <HI>Jacob,</HI> that he did wrestle with the Lord in secret Prayer, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 24. They are not the spiritual seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> that ne|ver do thus. I might mention <HI>Hezekiah, Daniel, Jeremiah Peter,</HI> and many other holy Servants of God, of whom we read in the Scripture, that they did practise this duty. Yea, we have the greatest Example that ever was, set before us for our imitation in this particular, that is Christs own Example; of whom it is said, that <HI>He departed into a solitary place and there prayed,</HI> Mark 1. 35. <HI>That he went apart to Pray,</HI> Mat. 14. 23. <HI>That he withdrew himself and prayed,</HI> Luk. 5. 16. And as the Lord Jesus Christ said, respecting another duty, <HI>I have given you an Example that ye should do as I have done,</HI> Joh: 13: 15: so doth he say as to this duty of Secret Prayer: I have given you an Example, and caused 
<PB N="133" REF="000374_0136_0FA559ACAA4A5310">
it to be entred upon everlasting Record, that so you that are my Disciples may in this follow me; and truly the sincere Disciples of Christ, will make conscience, <HI>so to walk as he walked,</HI> 1 Joh: 2: 6: They will strive to write after the blessed Copy which their Master Christ hath set before them.</P>
<P N="2">2: <HI>The truth is further evident, in that every sincere Servant of God doth make Con|science of obeying all his Commandments,</HI> Psal: 119: 6: <HI>Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy Precepts.</HI> Now the Lord hath commanded men that they should Worship him, not only in publick, and in Families, but in secret also, <HI>Eph:</HI> 6: 18: <HI>Pray with all Prayer:</HI> we have formerly shewed, that secret Prayer is in that precept enjoyned, as well as publick and Family Prayer. And when the Lord in his Word saith to men, <HI>Commune with your hearts, Psal:</HI> 4: 4: those two great duties wherein much of Religion doth consist, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> Self-Examination, and secret Prayer are implied: Yea, this Duty is most ex|presly commanded by the Lord Jesus 
<PB N="134" REF="000374_0137_0FA559ADDB8C8D20">
Christ, who saith <HI>When thou prayest enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, Mat.</HI> 6. 6. The sincere man doth not live in the commission of any known sin, nor in the wilful omission of any known du|ty. Surely then not in the omission of so great and known, and plainly comman|ded duty as this of secret Prayer, is:</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He that is sincere doth in special aim at approving himself in the sight of God.</HI> Hence is that expression of <HI>Godly sincerity</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 12. because the sincere man doth especially desire to have God's approba|tion. And therefore he abstains from se|cret sins, as <HI>Joseph</HI> did; yea, he dare not so much as in his thoughts give way unto that which he knoweth sinful, because he remembers that the eye of God is upon him, and doth therefore study to approve himself, not only unto men, but unto God. Hence also he practiseth secret duties, which the Lord alone is witness of. This we see in <HI>Nathaniel,</HI> that <HI>Israelite</HI> indeed in whom there was no reigning guile, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 47. 48. when that sincere <HI>Israelite</HI> was a|lone 
<PB N="135" REF="000374_0138_0FA559ADFB842520">
under the Fig-tree, no doubt praying there; The Son of God who hath eyes like a Flame of Fire saw him, and did highly approve of his sincerity, of which the spirit that breathed in his secret Prayers was a great discovery.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They that are sincere do in a peculiar manner delight in those duties wherein the greatest intimacy with God is to be enjoyed.</HI></P>
<P>That's one difference between an Hy|pocrite and a sincere Child of God. An Hypocrite will rest in the external per|formance of duty, though he hath no communion with God therein, whenas one that is sincere doth aim at that in du|ty; and therefore the more intimacy of Communion with God, is to be enjoyed, the more careful is he not to neglect such a duty.</P>
<P>Now this is true concerning <HI>Secret Prayer.</HI> Did <HI>Abraham,</HI> did <HI>Jacob,</HI> did <HI>Moses,</HI> did <HI>Da|niel,</HI> &amp; other Servants of the Lord, whom we read of in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> ever meet with more of God, then when they were in secret, pouring out their hearts before him? Intimate Friends when they are a|lone 
<PB N="136" REF="000374_0139_0FA559AEB566C6C0">
can speak more freely, and have a fuller communion then when others are by: so it is here. A <HI>Believer</HI> cannot so freely express himself before the Lord as to many particulars when others are by, as he can when there is none present but God and he. In secret places, he can speak his whole heart; and pour out his soul into the bosome of God, and of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Q 2. <HI>What is implied in this expression, of praying day and night without ceasing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> implieth <HI>constancy</HI> in the pra|ctice of this duty. Thus when it is said, <HI>Pray without ceasing.</HI> 1 Thes. 5. 17. <HI>i. e.</HI> don't begin to practise the duty, and afterwards leave off; but hold out all your dayes therein. It is the same with that, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 18. <HI>Praying with all perseverance.</HI> So that Phrase of night and day, intends the same thing, <HI>Rev.</HI> 7. 15. <HI>They serve him day and night in his Temple,</HI> h. e. continually and without intermission. Thus <HI>Isai.</HI> 62. 6. <HI>The Watchmen of Jerusalem shall not hold their peace day nor night,</HI> h. e. they shall hold on in their duty. Time you know is divi|ded 
<PB N="137" REF="000374_0140_0FA559AF77827AD0">
into day and night. If then a man shall continue to serve God, both by night and by day, then he doth serve him always.</P>
<P N="2">2. It implieth <HI>Frequency.</HI> Those words <HI>without ceasing,</HI> some read <HI>without intermis|sion.</HI> Not but that the duty of Prayer may and must be intermitted, as to actu|al performance, that so other duties as to our general or particular calling may be attended, but the spirit of the duty should not be intermitted, Christians must be care|ful that they never lose that: There ought to be an habitual inclination, and readi|ness to attend the duty of Prayer, whene|ver called thereunto: Also, there should be a frequency therein, as to actual per|formance. And when it is said, that a man should pray in secret, <HI>day and night,</HI> that implieth, that he should do so very often, <HI>Psal:</HI> 1. 2. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 3. 10. Indeed secret Prayer should be every mans daily pra|ctice. Therefore when Christ bid his Disciples pray in secret, he bids them say, <HI>Give us this day, &amp;c.</HI> Mat. 6. 6, 11. from whence we may infer that secret Prayer should be a Christians daily practice.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="000374_0141_0FA559B2996311B8">
It is not determined in the Scripture, how often every man must pray in secret: on|ly that he ought to do thus daily. We find that <HI>Daniels</HI> constant course was to pray by himself three times every day, <HI>Dan.</HI> 6. 10. And <HI>David</HI> saith, that he did praise God <HI>seven times a day,</HI> h. e. often times, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 164. And there is great reason that men should offer Prayers and praises before God in secret, at least once every day, and once every night; so may they be said to pray without ceasing day and night.</P>
<P>We come now to enquire into the Rea|sons of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>From the consideration of the omnipresence of God.</HI> He seeth and hears what is done not only in publick Assem|blies, and in Families, but in Closets, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23. 24. <HI>Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him, saith the Lord, do I not fill Heaven and Earth?</HI> This reason is urged as an Argument for secret Prayer, even because our Heavenly Father <HI>seeth in secret,</HI> Mat. 6. 6. If Men do not prac|tice this Duty, it argueth great Atheism, 
<PB N="139" REF="000374_0142_0FA559B387B4A418">
and that they do not really, and with their whole hearts, believe the omnipre|sence of God; so by the practice hereof, they testifie that they have the sense of this Truth upon their hearts; therefore should they pray in secret.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>Because there are many requests fit and necessary to be mentioned before the Lord in secret, that may not be expressed be|fore others,</HI> e. g. Requests concerning a man's particular wants, which may press him, and oppress him: and concerning his secret sins which he hath been guilty of before the Lord. If God by his provi|dence hath kept a mans sins from the knowledge of the World, he would sin grievously in divulging his own secret sins, and yet as ever he doth desire the pardon of them, or the salvation of his Soul, he must confess and bewail them before God in secret places: in which respect, secret Prayer is necessary. Again, a Child of God may be molested with the prevalency of some particular corruption or tempta|tion, which it is not meet to speak of be|fore others, yet it concerns him to cry 
<PB N="140" REF="000374_0143_0FA559B453CE4448">
unto God day and night for power against it. There are also requests which may re|spect particular persons, whose cases and circumstances may be such as others should not know of; upon which account also prayer in secret is necessary. There are some that a man may have special reason to pray for them in his secret addresses to the throne of grace, as <HI>Paul</HI> for <HI>Timothy.</HI> There are also some that we ought to pray against them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> special and implacable Enemies of the Lords Name and People, whom it may not be convenient to mention whilst others are in hearing; but we should put the Lord in mind of them, and those Ar|rows which are shot out of Closets, will at last fall upon them, and smite them down into the pit.</P>
<P>Reas. 3. <HI>Equity requireth this from the Lords Servants.</HI> He brings them into his Chambers, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1. 4. <HI>The King has brought me into his Chambers.</HI> Therefore they ought to bring him into their Chambers. There is a secret providence of God at work for them continually, <HI>Psal.</HI> 31. 20. <HI>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence, 
<PB N="144" REF="000374_0144_0FA559B4E1310260">
thou shalt keep them secretly in a Pavi|lion,</HI> Shall the Lord hide his Servants in those Chambers of safety which he hath prepared for them? And shall not they pray unto him and praise him in their se|cret Chambers? Yea, and as for sincere Believers, the Lord hath provided Cham|bers for them in his house, even in the Pal|lace Royal of Heaven, there to praise his Name for evermore. Therefore in the mean time they should praise him and pray unto him day and night in their Chambers here. The Lord said unto the Prophet <HI>Zechariah, If thou wilt keep my charge, I will give thee places to walk amongst these that stand by,</HI> Zech: 3: 7: Intimating that the faithful Servants of God, shall one day walk in the Galleries of Heaven, amongst the holy Angels that are there. It is but reason then, that they should bring the Lord in|to their Closets here upon earth.</P>
<P>USE. 1. <HI>Of Reprehension:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1: <HI>To them that neglect secret Prayer.</HI> Are there not many whose Consci|ences are smiting them whilst the word of 
<PB N="142" REF="000374_0145_0FA559B583BFF218">
the Lord is speaking to them. How ma|ny Children, and young ones that never go alone to Pray! You Children did you this day go, and the last night go alone to pray? yea, and there are elder ones, that the Chambers they lodge in, will witness against them at the last day, for living in the neglect of secret Prayer before the Lord. They are many times alone whole nights together, but as it is said of the wicked, <HI>God is not in all their thoughts.</HI> Well, be assured, if ever God intend mercy to thy soul, he will make thee get alone to pray, and to pour out thy Soul in his presence. For (as I have formerly shew|ed) in Conversion, that's one of the first things, a poor sinner begins to be in ear|nest in his Secret Prayers and cries to hea|ven. As it was said of <HI>Paul,</HI> whilest in the pangs of the new Birth, <HI>Act.</HI> 9. 11. <HI>Be|hold he Prayeth,</HI> so if the Lord convert and save thy Soul, <HI>Behold thou wilt pray in se|cret.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This Reproof belongs to them also, <HI>who are not freequent and constant in the pra|ctice of this duty.</HI> Alas! I know there 
<PB N="143" REF="000374_0146_0FA559B9D32BE1F8">
have been many that the Word of the Lord hath met with them; they have been Sermon-sick, and then they would pray in secret; but they have not done thus without ceasing. Their <HI>Convictions</HI> have died, and they became as <HI>Prayerless</HI> as ever in their lives before. Or it may be some distressing affliction or other, hath brought them upon their <HI>Knees</HI> before the Lord. Like those in <HI>Isai.</HI> 26. 16. <HI>Lord, in trouble they visited thee, they poured out a Prayer, when thy chastening was upon them.</HI> Ah! Lord God, hath it not been thus, with many a soul that <HI>hears</HI> me this day? but their <HI>distresses</HI> being removed, they continue not in secret Prayer. Oh con|sider what the Scripture saith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 38. <HI>If any draw back, my Soul shall have no plea|sure in him.</HI> To begin a course of Prayer, and then to leave off again, <HI>is to draw back.</HI> Will the Lord take pleasure in such? He hath said, he will not. And yet I wish there be not Professors of Religion, Church-members, whose Consciences do (or may) accuse them for inconstancy in the performance of this great duty of secret 
<PB N="141" REF="000374_0147_0FA559BB0E7BE2C0">
prayer: If thou art such an one, thou hast on thee one of the sad marks of an Hy|pocrite: for it is said of the Hypocrite, <HI>Will he alwayes call upon God?</HI> Job 27: 10: I wonder how such men and women, can think that they belong to God, or that they have a real interest in Heaven, who can find in their hearts to live without secret communion with him: especially considering, that the Scripture tells them that he that shall allow himself in the wil|ful breach of the least Commandment, shall not be admitted, nor accounted of in the Kingdom of Heaven, <HI>Mat:</HI> 5: 19: where then will they appear, who live in the neglect of so great a Commandment as this of <HI>Secret Prayer</HI> is?</P>
<P N="3">3: <HI>This reproveth those that instead of Praying in secret are sinning in secret:</HI> The Apostle saith, it is a shame to speak of those things which are done of some in secret, <HI>Eph:</HI> 5: 12: How do wretched sin|ners bless themselves, if they can sin out of the sight of men: especially as to that iniquity of which it is said, <HI>That the ab|horred of the Lord shall fall into it:</HI> They 
<PB N="145" REF="000374_0148_0FA559BDC9FCEE38">
commit Adultery, and other sorts of un|clean Abominations in secret places: or they live in secret <HI>Self-pollution,</HI> which is commonly the young-mans sin; an evil condemned in the Scripture, under the Name of <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> and sometimes un|der the Name of <HI>Effeminateness;</HI> and the Word of the Lord saith, that whoever liveth in it, shall certainly be excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Instead of mourning and bleeding in secret places that ever thou hast been guilty of this sin, dost thou still live in it? then wo to thy soul. There are two things which I am sure thou dost not remember as thou shouldst do.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thou dost not remember that the all-seeing eye of an infinite God looketh upon thee. If a Child of seven years old saw thee, thou wouldst be afraid and asha|med to commit that sin; and wouldst thou do it, if thou didst behold God looking on thee?</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither dost thou remember the day of Judgment. For then every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil 
<PB N="146" REF="000374_0149_0FA559BEA275CED0">
will be brought to light, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. 14. If thou didst believe, that all the World should one day hear of that secret sin of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, wouldst thou commit it? certainly if Men considered this, they would sin in secret less, and pray in secret more.</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> II. Of Exhortation, <HI>to follow the Apostles Example, by being much in the pra|ctice of this Duty of secret Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Do but consider, the good and benefit which will follow. Whoever is sincere therein shall find that his secret Prayers have not been lost labour. A Man may thereby obtain mercy for his own Soul: even Grace and spiritual blessings. <HI>Solo|mons</HI> Wisdom was given to him as an An|swer unto his secret Prayers. Comfort and assurance of Gods favour may in this way be obtained: you that complain, you have not assurance of your Salvation, con|sider of it. There have been those (I could tell you of marvelous instances to this purpose) that when they have been upon their knees in secret, the holy Spirit hath broke in upon their Souls with ever|lasting Consolation. Yea, a Man by se|cret 
<PB N="147" REF="000374_0150_0FA559BF4053B5B0">
Prayer may obtain mercy for his Fa|mily. The lives of all <HI>Jacobs</HI> Children were spared, in answer to their Fathers Prayers in secret. Nay, more, one righte|ous man by Prayer in secret, may be a means to divert Judgment, and to obtain mercy for the whole Town, and Land where he dwells. How far did <HI>Abraham</HI> by his Prayers in secret prevail for <HI>Sodom;</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> for <HI>Israel?</HI> And what mercy did <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Amos</HI> obtain for the whole Land by their secret Prayers?</P>
<P>And truly they are the persons who are like to experience special mercy in the evil day. They that pray much in secret and that mourn continually in secret pla|ces, because of the sins of the times, shall experience if not temporal (that which is better) spiritual preservations in a day of general Calamity, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. 4. <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 17.</P>
<P>For Direction here;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be very particular in secret Prayer.</HI> Men should in secret before the Lord, often bewail every sin they have been guilty of, whilest in a state of Unregeneracy. As to the kind of sin, that is, though it may 
<PB N="148" REF="000374_0151_0FA559C0090EF458">
be the acts of sin have been so often ite|rated, as 'tis not possible to mention them all particularly. And if after Conversi|on they fall into evils, for which Consci|ence condemns them, they should parti|cularly acknowledge those sins in their se|cret addresses unto the Throne of Grace, begging for the Pardon of them. Parti|cular Plagues of Heart should be mourn|ed for in secret: so there are particular mercies to be prayed for; and particular Friends (near Relations especially) which ought to be remembred in secret Prayers day and night without ceasing. Personal and particular concerns are to be inlarged upon in closet Prayer especially.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Take heed of resting in the external performance of this Duty.</HI> Do not think that you must needs be saved, meerly be|cause you Pray in secret. You especially who are the Children of Godly Parents, and have ever practised this Duty, because of the frequent Exhortations, and Exam|ples which have been set before you. Oh rest not here, without experiencing a work of true Faith and Regeneration in your 
<PB N="149" REF="000374_0152_0FA559C143746A28">
Souls. Remember, that though a man cannot be sincere, if he live in the neglect of so great a Duty, yet he may continue in the practice of it, after a formal man|ner (as <HI>Paul</HI> before his Conversion did, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 14. and for all that, re|main in a state of Hypocrisie. Nor indeed is there any duty, but an Hypocrite may attend it without ceasing, as to the exter|nal part of the Duty. Wherefore, be|ware of taking up with that.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Labour after intimacy of Communion with God therein.</HI> Its true, we must re|member our distance, considering that God is in Heaven, and we are on Earth. He is an infinite Majesty, and we are poor inconsiderable Dust-heaps; and therefore may not forget that we are dust and ashes, when we take upon us to speak unto the Lord of Heaven and Earth. Neverthe|less he alloweth us to be humbly familiar with his divine Majesty. An holy man upon his Death-bed could say, <HI>If the walls of this Chamber could speak, they would testi|fie how often I have met with God here; and how familiar he hath been with my Soul.</HI> Oh 
<PB N="150" REF="000374_0153_0FA559C1A79C07A8">
labour after that, to know by blessed ex|perience, what it is to have intimate com|munion with God in Closets, and to be familiar with the Lord Jesus there.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Practice other Duties in secret, which are an help to Prayer.</HI> e. g. Self-Examina|tion is a great help unto secret Prayer. When a man upon Examination and se|rious reflections upon himself, seeth what his defects have been and are; and withal perceiveth what God hath done for his Soul, he must needs thereby be quickened in his calling upon the Name of the Lord. And read the Scriptures daily in secret; and having so done, meditate and ponder up|on what you have read; and then fall upon your knees before the Lord, and pour out your very hearts in his presence. And know for your encouragement, that your secret Prayers shall one day be re|warded openly, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 6. When you come to die, you will not repent of the time that hath been thus spent. Nor at the last day, when the Lord Jesus will openly be|fore <HI>all the World</HI> speak of the secret Prayers (as <HI>well as secret Alms-deeds</HI>) of 
<PB N="151" REF="000374_0154_0FA559C3C891AA20">
his Servants. O how <HI>glorious will it be</HI> when Christ shall say (as sometimes to <HI>Natha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">el</HI>) I saw thee every day and night upon thy knees in thy <HI>Closet;</HI> I bestowed mercy on others out of respect to thy Prayers, and brought about great changes in the World, in answer thereunto? <HI>Blessed is that Servant whom the Lord shall find thus doing.</HI></P>
