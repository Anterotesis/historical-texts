<HEAD>MEMOIR CONCERNING THE CULTIVATION OF FLAX.</HEAD>
<P>WE here present the public with a com|plete memoir touching the cultivation of flax, which will supply what our books of oeconomy have not said, confirm the good precepts they have given, and improve a great many others. It is written by an understanding man, who has lived long in Holland; and it is well known, that flax is a considerable branch of the trade of that country.</P>
<P>The Dutch are, without contradiction, the surest guides we can follow on this subject. The difficulty is to draw from them the ne|cessary instruction; for they are in general, jea|lous of their secrets, which are forbid to be dis|covered under severe penalties; above all things, they make a mystery of there method of pre|paring flax. Very few people find means to penetrate into the places where it is managed; and these must not be in the least suspected of being drawn thither by any other motive than simple curiosity; but no foreign merchant or manufacturer is ever admitted.</P>
<P>The soil of every country is not fit for flax, which requires fat land: and too much care can|not be taken in choosing that where we propose
<PB N="2" REF="015597_0008_0F998DFF74A981A0">
to sow this plant: for upon this depends the quality of the grain, together with the number and strength of the stalks. In some countries, however, they followed a quite contrary me|thod, preferring a light and warm soil: true it is, the flax which this produces, yields a fairer, finer and softer thread; but the harvest is indif|ferent, and in these meagre lands, the grain degenerates from the first or second year. On the contrary, in fat soils that are a little moist, the flax bears excellent grain, and the stalks are very fine. The Dutch, whose flourishing trade evinces their dexterity in this particular, sow very little flax in the province of Holland, because the soil of it is poor; but in Zealand where the land is extremely fat and moist enough, they reap that which they employ in their manufac|tures. The linseed which they rear in that province is sold dearer, and much more esteem|ed than that which is brought from the Baltic.</P>
<P>This assertion may seem contradictory to an incontestable fact, which is, that the Dutch themselves yearly purchase the linseed of Riga: but the solution of this seeming paradox, is very easy. The Dutch bring linseed from Riga, only for the use of other countries; and this is not because their own seed degenerates, but because they have not a sufficient quantity for the foreign demand.</P>
<P>Although I advise people to choose very fat land for their flax, I do not pretend to say that in these only flax ought to be sown. I maintain nothing more than that they are the best, and
<PB N="3" REF="015597_0009_0F998E029C50F660">
that other lands are only endowed with degrees of goodness, in proportion to the qualities by which they approach the nature of those fat lands. And indeed, although I have condemn|ed the use of light soil, as it may be proper to have fine thread, I shall not at all oppose the practice of sowing sometimes weak ground with linseed. There will even be an advantage in cultivating soils of a different nature. We shall have linseed of our own growth, without being obliged to have recourse to that which the Dutch bring us from Riga.</P>
<P>After having chosen a suitable piece of ground, we must give it the necessary preparation before it be sown: and this is the method which is fol|lowed in Flanders and Zealand. To fatten the ground, the Dutch make use of dung, ashes, and sometimes human ordure: but this last sort is only used in small spots of ground which has long lain fallow. They, moreover, employ marl, lime, the cleansings of pools, the raspings of horn; and upon the sea-coast, they gather for the same purpose, the sea-weed, which forms a kind of glue upon the surface of the waves. These different fatteners, which are preferred according to the difference of soil, are excellent for flax: being much better than dung: for, if this last is not sufficiently old and rotten, it raises among the seed a sort of weeds which grow in great number, and do infinite injury to the flax, in spite of all the care that can be ta|ken to extirpate them. This inconvenience is not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed from the use of marl, lime,
<PB N="4" REF="015597_0010_0F998E03C5FD1C90">
sea-weed, and raspings of horn; and this ad|vantage certainly deserves the entire consideration of the farmer. Weeds, (and these I call para|sites, which grow contrary to the inclination of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmer) weeds, I say, do abundance of mis|chief to all sorts of grain, but to flax in parti|cular. For, they change its quality, and dimi|nish its quantity.</P>
<P>With regard to the labouring part, in Zealand where the ground is fat, strong and moist, two different methods are followed. The Zealand|ers plough the land thrice, four times, and even oftener, and leave it fallow during a whole sum|mer; or else they begin by making it bear the seed, and in that case, this is their method of managing it. After having dunged and tilled it twice, they sow the seed. The following year they plant it with madder, which remains upon it for the space of two years, and in the fourth they sow their flax. By these means they are sure of having a moveable soil; for besides the repetition of labouring bestowed upon it, before the sowing of the seed in the first year, besides the fermentation of the dung, and the other labour|ings which are sometimes repeated to the num|ber of five times, in order to prepare it for the madder, they are obliged to be continually at work upon it, in extirpating the roots of that plant.</P>
<P>Ground thus prepared, one would imagine ought to reward the cares of the farmer. Ne|vertheless, the Zealanders themselves prefer the first method; when they want to have the most
<PB N="5" REF="015597_0011_0F998E0589F6BC48">
plentiful crop of linseed. And indeed the abode of the madder in the earth, for the space of two years, must greatly diminish the richness of the soil. The Zealanders follow this last method, for no other reason than the benefit which accrues to them from the madder: which benefit is such, that the produce of their land managed in the manner I have described for four years, being added, is more considerable, than if they had practised the first method.</P>
<P>In Flanders, where there is no trade for mad|der, and where the lands are extremely strong, es|pecially in the neighbourhood of Courtray, the farmers do not sow flax until after having let the ground lie fallow a whole summer and winter, and then laboured it several times sucessively. In the driest and highest soils that will bear flax, as that round Antwerp, Ghent and Bruges, the people think it necessary to labour them three times, and never sow the seed, until they have let them lie fallow for one summer at least. When the ground is rendered sufficiently move|able by these different labourings, the farmer's next care is to give it the last preparation for its receiving the seed. In Zealand it is disposed in|to uniform beds separated by small ditches: the beds being from fifty to sixty feet broad, and the ditches about two or three feet deep, and a foot and an half broad. This disposition maintains a suitable degree of moisture in the ground: the breadth and uniformity of the beds keep them in a condition to retain water, enough to secure them from drought; and the ditches sunk
<PB N="6" REF="015597_0012_0F998E0632538B80">
at proper distances, discharge the superfluity in time of excessive rains.</P>
<P>This method cannot be too much commend|ed: a farmer by putting it in practice, need not be afraid of sowing linseed in a fat ground, though it is very moist; for the ditches will not only free the field of that water which might other|wise ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the seed, but will likewise, leave moi|sture enough for the growth of the plant. The Flemings are so much persuaded of the necessity there is for a certain degree of moisture to the flax, that in their light and dry grounds they make no ditches at all: but usually, make the surface of the field very even and uniform, that it may the longer retain the rain-water.</P>
<P>The soil being well prepared, we must choose the seed proper to be sown; and surely, the farmer cannot be too careful in the choice. That which is short, roundish, firm, oily, heavy, of a shining or clear brown colour, is accounted the best: and the peasants of Zealand are very atten|tive in examining if all these different qualities unite in that which he is about to sow. In or|der to ascertain its firmness, he takes a large hand|ful and squeezing it until it pierces between his fingers and thumb, judges of its solidity by the quantity which is squeezed out by this compres|sion, and by the slow manner in which it comes out. To know whether it is heavy, he throws an handful into a glass of water: that which is good soon goes to the bottom; and he rejects that which swims on the surface. To prove its oiliness, he throws some into the fire; and when
<PB N="7" REF="015597_0013_0F998E06EA51BD80">
it kindles and sparkles as soon as it touches the coals, he makes no scruple in employing it. There is besides, another method used in Zea|land, which is to sow some of the seed in little beds of earth; and in a little time, they see by the effect whether or not it is of the right kind.</P>
<P>All seed in general, soon degenerates, but par|ticularly linseed, let the soil in which it is pro|duced, be never so strong; for which reason it is proper to change the seed, and the more often the better. The most common rule followed on this occasion, is to sow in strong ground, the seed which is gathered from a light soil, and to commit to a light soil what has been produced in a strong one. This is certainly a very good rule, when properly understood: for if it is lite|rally followed, we run the risque of being mista|ken. Certain it is, light grounds yield seed of a very feeble quality, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with any ad|vantage be employed in the same kind of soil: and a farmer ought never to sow lands of this na|ture but with a view to have fine flax: he will always be mistaken when he expects good seed from it. The rule therefore needs explanation. And here it is:</P>
<P>Among fat lands, there are some which are more or less so, without losing their title to that denomination. In order then to have always good seed, we must sow in strong ground, that which has been produced in ground of the same kind, though not quite so strong. On the con|trary, in ground that is strong, we must sow
<PB N="8" REF="015597_0014_0F998E080C7558A8">
seed which hath been produced in ground which is still stronger. The smallest difference in the nature of the soil is sufficient to hinder the seed from degenerating.</P>
<P>By observing this rule we shall free ourselves of the slavery to which we are now subject, in using the seed brought from Riga, The disad|vantage of receiving it from the hands of the Dutch, who supply us, is greater than may be imagined. Besides, that we are not sure they bring the best, we run the risque of having that which will not agree with our lands: for, we buy it in the dark, without a possibility of knowing from what kind of soil it has been reap|ed. Consequently we run the hazard of sowing our fields with seed produced from the same kind of ground, in which case, we must neces|sarily have a very feeble crop: for lands, though situated at a great distance from one another, may be absolutely of the same nature.</P>
<P>The quantity of seed sown upon any field, has a great influence upon the crop. If we sow a smaller quantity than the field is able to bear, the whole will profit by that deficiency; the stalks will be strong, and the seed excellent. If the seed be sown thicker, the flax will produce a finer thread; the harvest will be more plente|ous; but the seed will be of an inferior quality. This last method is practised by the Dutch, who are in no fear of a scarcity of seed. But it is the farmers's business to know the nature of his own ground; and he will be guided by his interest and experience. A strong ground may bear a
<PB N="9" REF="015597_0015_0F998E086A994DD0">
greater quantity of seed, without any detriment to the quality of the fruit which it shall pro|duce. On the other hand, in a ground that is not quite so strong, the same quantity of seed will rise but indifferently, and produce very lit|tle advantage. The Dutch and Flemings em|ploy about three or four bushels per acre.</P>
<P>Linseed must be sown in mild, dry weather: and may be committed to the ground in the month of March, if the season be favour|able. Being thus early sown, it will be ripe at the end of June, or in the beginning of July at farthest; and the farmer will have leisure to manage it in a proper manner. This expedition will also furnish another advantage. After the harvest of the flax, we may sow turnips or other things of that nature, which will succeed to ad|miration, and usefully occupy the ground, which would produce nothing during the remaining part of the year, if the season had been more ad|vanced when the flax was ready to be cut down.</P>
<P>I have seen some farmers in Holland and Flan|ders, sow grass some days after the linseed had been committed to the same ground. This herb far from hurting, facilitates the growth of the other plant. In all probability, the young grass secures the roots of the flax from the coolness of the rain, and at the same time shelters it from the heat of the sun. I do not know whether this explanation of the alliance between these two plants, is just; but it is well known that flax and hay rise very well together, and that, after having taken away the first, a very good crop of the last will remain.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="015597_0016_0F998E095E231A68">There is very little to be said upon the man|ner of sowing linseed. I shall only observe, that the sower must follow the ridge in a direct line, throwing the seed with his right hand, and in returning use the left hand: for it is of great consequence that the seed should be equally scattered. Some days after, when it is time that the seed should be buried, they sow the grass-seed, if they choose they should come up together. Both are covered by the harrow, and pressed by the roller. As to the weeding, that operation begins, when the blade is two inches high, and continues until it is five: but it is dangerous to use the heel of the shoe in crushing the weeds, because thereby the flax is sometimes damaged.</P>
<P>Some farmers pluck it up before it hath arrived at maturity; pretending that the thread is fairer while the plant is green. But they are mistaken, and lose their seed without any in|demnity; for the flax yields the finest thread, and that in the largest quantity, when the plant is seasonably pulled: so that the farmer who an|ticipates the time of its maturity over and above his seed, loses one half of the crop. The fila|ments of this flax, suffers great waste in the dif|ferent methods of dressing, and falls almost alto|gether in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds: for what resists the pond, the sowing press, and the hatchel, is of an in|ferior quality to that which would have been produced, had the flax been pulled when ripe.</P>
<P>The Flemings, whose experience may be de|pended upon, leave it growing as long as possi|ble, on purpose to have a finer thread; and that they may have it as ripe as it can be, for their manufactures of linen or lace, they often
<PB N="11" REF="015597_0017_0F998E09E67E5308">
run the risque of losing the seed, which easily escapes.</P>
<P>When the flax begins to be yellow, or rather to approach a citron colour, it is usually time to reap it. But in order to be more certain of its maturity, they pull a few stalks, and take out the seed, which when firm and of a clear brown colour, the flax is ripe. The Dutch wait until the stalks are ready to open, and even until some of the ripest are actually so: but the best advice I can give upon this subject, is to delay the harvest of flax as long as possible, without run|ning too great a risque of losing the seed, which last, as well as the flax itself, is the better for this delay.</P>
<P>Some farmers have observed, that a kind of mildew falls upon flax that is sown in light ground, about fifteen days before its maturity; and that this corrosive dew burns at first the seed, and afterwards the stalk. If this observa|tion be true, those who cultivate flax in a light ground, ought to pay no regard to the custom of oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, who delay the harvest until the flax be entirely ripe. In Holland, the flax being pulled, is laid softly upon the ground in large handfuls, the head of the plant being always turned towards the south; and several handfuls are put one over another, until the heap is a foot and an half high. Care must always be taken to lay the heads towards the south: for the flax being thus disposed, continues to receive from the sun the degree of maturity it may want, and is secured from the rain, if any should fall. But this disposition is only observed when the weather is uncertain; for when it is dry, they content themselves with spreading
<PB N="12" REF="015597_0018_0F998E0AA03EF970">
the flax by handfuls upon the field, that it may be the sooner ready to be carried off. If the season is favourable, twelve or fourteen days are sufficient to make it perfectly dry: but when the weather is wet, they are sometimes obliged to leave the flax in little heaps, for the space of eighteen or twenty days. In countries exposed to high winds, this method will not avail. There it is made into bottles that stand on end, ex|posed to the sun, in order to be aired and dried. In some places, the flax is bound and put up without being seeded, and in this manner it is kept 'till the month of December: by this ma|nagement however, we run the risque of losing the seed. But in Holland and Flanders, it is shelled as soon as the flax is brought from the field. In these countries it is not the farmer who bestows upon the plant the management neces|sary for its employment; for as soon as it is reap|ed it is delivered to the workman, who dresses it accordingly.</P>
<P>Flax is ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly lodged by the winds and rains, and as it sometimes cannot be raised again, this accident ruins the hopes of the planter. In or|der to obviate this misfortune, some people di|vide the field in little squares of five feet; fix a forked stick at every angle, and when the flax begins to grow up, lay across these sticks, small long poles, which serve as a support to the plant: but this precaution is attended with expence. Others, instead of poles, use cords; but these do not so well answer the purpose. When care is taken not to waste too much seed in sowing, the stalks that rise are strong enough to support themselves; but then the flax does not yield such a fine thread.</P>

<HEAD>THE MANNER OF RAISING AND DRESSING FLAX, AND HEMP.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following particulars with regard to the manner of raising, and dressing FLAX and HEMP, has been for some years past warmly commended, by the Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures, and Improvements in SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the choice of the <HI>SOIL,</HI> and preparing the <HI>GROUND</HI> for <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A SKILFUL Flax-raiser always prefers a free open deep loam, and all grounds that produced the preceding year a good crop of turnip, cabbage, potatoes, barley, or broad clover; or has been formerly laid down rich, and kept for some years in pasture.</P>
<P>A clay soil, the second or third crop after being limed, will answer well for flax; pro|vided, if the ground be still stiff, that it be brought to a proper mould, by tilling after harvest, to expose it to the winter frosts.</P>
<P>All new grounds produce a strong crop of flax, and pretty free of weeds. When a great many mole-heaps appear upon new ground, it answers the better for flax after one tilling.</P>
<P>Flax-seed ought never to be sown on grounds that are either too wet or dry; but on such as
<PB N="14" REF="015597_0020_0F998E0C9EFAC940">
retain a natural moisture: and such grounds as are inclined to weeds ought to be avoided, un|less prepared by a careful summer-fallow.</P>
<P>If the lintseed be sown early, and the flax not allowed to stand for seed, a crop of turnip may be got after the flax that very year; the second year a crop of bear or barley may be taken; and the third year, grass-seeds are sometimes sown along with the lintseed. This is the method mostly practised in and about the counties of Lincoln and Somerset, where great quantities of flax and hemp are every year raised, and where these crops have long been capital articles. There, old ploughed grounds are never sown with lintseed, unless the soil be very rich and clean. A certain worm, called in Scotland the Coup-worm, abounds in new broke up grounds, which greatly hurts every crop but flax. In small inclosures surrounded with trees or high hedges, the flax, for want of free air, is subject to fall before it be ripe, and the droppings of rain and dew from the trees prevent the flax within the reach of the trees from growing to any perfection.</P>
<P>Of preceding crops, potatoes and hemp are the best preparation for flax. In the fens of Lincoln, upon proper ground of old tillage, they sow hemp, dunging well the first year; the second year hemp without dung; the third year flax without dung; and that same year a crop of turnip eat on the ground by sheep; the fourth year hemp with a large coat of dung, and so on forever.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="015597_0021_0F998E0D44261A70">If the ground be free and open, it should be but once ploughed, and that as shallow as possible, not deeper than two inches and an half. It should be laid flat, reduced to a fine garden-mould by much harrowing, and all stones and sods should be carried off.</P>
<P>Except a little pigeon's dung for cold or sour ground, no other dung should be used prepar|atory for flax, because it produces too many weeds, and throws up the flax thin and poor upon the stalk.</P>
<P>Before sowing, the bulky clods should be broken, or carried of the ground; and stones, quickenings, and every other thing that may hinder the growth of the flax, should be re|moved.</P>

<HEAD>Of the choice of <HI>LINTSEED.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE brighter in colour, and heavier the seed is, so much the better: that which when bruised appears of a light or yel|lowish green, and fresh in the heart, oily and not dry, and smells and tastes sweet, and not fusty, may be depended upon.</P>
<P>Dutch seed of the preceding year's growth, for the most part, answers best; but it seldom succeeds if kept another year. It ripens sooner than any other foreign seed. Philadelphia seed produces fine lint and few bolls, because sown thick, and answers best in wet cold soils. Riga seed produces coarser lint, and the greatest quantity of seed. Scots seed, when well win|nowed
<PB N="16" REF="015597_0022_0F998E0E65D9B280">
and kept, and changed from one kind of soil to another, sometimes answers pretty well; but should be sown thick, as many of its grains are bad, and fail. It springs well, and its flax is sooner ripe than any other; but its produce afterwards is generally inferior to that from fo|reign seed.</P>
<P>A kind has been lately imported, called memmel-seed, which looks well, is short and plump, but seldom grows above eight inches, and on that account ought not to be sown.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of sowing <HI>LINTSEED.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE quantity of lintseed sown, should be proportioned to the condition of the soil; for if the ground be in good heart, and the seed sown thick, the crop will be in danger of falling before it is ready for pulling. From eleven to twelve pecks Linlithgow measure of Dutch or Riga seed, is generally sufficient for one Scots acre; and about ten pecks of Philadelphia seed, which being the smallest grained, goes farthest. Riga lintseed, and the next year's produce of it, is preferred in Lincolnshire.</P>
<P>The time for sowing lintseed is from the middle of March to the end of April, as the ground and season answers; but the earlier the seed is sown, the less the crop interferes with the corn-harvest.</P>
<P>Late sown lintseed may grow long, but the flax upon the stalk will be thin and poor.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015597_0023_0F998E0F19933208">After sowing, the ground ought to be har|rowed till the seed is well covered, and then (supposing the soil as before-mentioned to be free and reduced to a fine mould) the ground ought to be rolled.</P>
<P>When a farmer sows a large quantity of lint|seed, he may find it proper to sow a part earlier and part latter, that in the future operations of weeding, pulling, watering, and grassing, the the work may be the easier and more conveni|ently gone about.</P>
<P>It ought always to be sown on a dry bed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Weeding <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT ought to be weeded when the crop is about four inches long. If longer deferred, the weeders will so much break and crook the stalks, that they will never perhaps recover their straightness again; and when the flax grows crooked, it is more liable to be hurt in the rippling and swingling.</P>
<P>Quickening-grass should not be tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n up; for, being strongly rooted, the pulling of it al|ways loosens a deal of the lint.</P>
<P>If there is an appearance of a settled drought, it is better to defer the weeding, than by that operation to expose the tender roots of the flax to the drought.</P>
<P>How soon the weeds are got out, they ought to be carried off the field, instead of being laid in the furrows, where they often take root
<PB N="18" REF="015597_0024_0F998E1214C323C8">
again, and at any rate obstruct the growth of the flax in the furrows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Pulling <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the crop grows so short and branchy, as to appear more valuable for seed than flax, it ought not to be pulled before it be thoroughly ripe; but if it grows long and not branchy, the seed should be dis|regarded, and all the attention given to the flax. In the last case it ought to be pulled after the bloom has fallen, when the stalk begins to turn yellow, and before the leaves fall, and the bolls turn hard and sharp-pointed.</P>
<P>When the stalk is small, and carries few bolls, the flax is fine; but the stalk of coarse flax is gross, rank, branchy, and carries many bolls.</P>
<P>When flax has fallen and lies, such as lies ought to be immediately pulled, whether it has grown enough or not, as otherwise it will rot altogether.</P>
<P>When parts of the same field grow unequally, so that some parts are ready for pulling before other parts; only what is ready should be pul|led, and the rest should be suffered to stand till ready.</P>
<P>The flax-raiser ought to be at pains to pull, and keep by itself, each different kind of lint which he finds in his field; what is both long and fine, by itself; what is both long and coarse by itself; what is both short and fine, by itself;
<PB N="19" REF="015597_0025_0F998E1335B79640">
what is both short and coarse, by itself; and in like manner every other kind by itself that is of the same size and quality. If the different kinds be not thus kept separate, the flax must be much damaged in the watering, and the other succeeding operations.</P>
<P>What is commonly called under growth, may be neglected as useless.</P>
<P>Few persons that have seen flax pulled, are ignorant of the method of laying it in handfuls across other: which gives the flax sufficient air, and keeps the handfuls separate and ready for the rippler.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of stacking up <HI>FLAX</HI> during the winter, and Winnowing the Seed.</HEAD>
<P>IF the flax be more valuable than the seed, it ought by no means to be stacked up; for its own natural juice assists it great|ly in the watering: whereas, if kept long un|watered, it loses that juice, and the harle ad|heres so much to the boon, that it requires longer time to water, and even the quality of the flax becomes thereby harsher and coarser. Besides, the flax stacked up over ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, is in great danger from vermin and other accidents; the water in spring is not so soft and warm as in harvest; and near a year is thereby lost of the use of the lint: but if the flax be so short and branchy as to appear most valuable for seed, it ought, after pulling, to be stooked and dried upon the field, as is done with corn,
<PB N="20" REF="015597_0026_0F998E1477BCD838">

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Rippling <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER pulling, if the flax is to be re|garded more than the seed, it should be allowed to lie some hours upon the ground to dry a little, and so gain some firm|ness, to prevent the skin or harle, which is the flax, from rubbing off in the rippling; an operation which ought by no means to be neglected, as the bolls, if put into the water along with the flax, breed vermin there, and otherwise spoil the water. The bolls also prove very inconvenient in the grassing and breaking.</P>
<P>In Lincolnshire and Ireland, they think that rippling hurts the flax; and therefore, in place of rippling, they strike the bolls against a stone.</P>
<P>The handfuls for rippling should not be great, as that endangers the lint in the rippling comb.</P>
<P>After rippling, the flax-raiser will perceive, that he is able to assort each size and quality of the flax by itself more exactly than he could before.</P>

<PB N="21" REF="015597_0027_0F998E151D0D2628">
<HEAD>Of Watering <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A RUNNING stream wastes the lint, makes it white, and frequently carries it away. Lochs, by the great quantity and motion of the water, also waste and whiten the flax, though not so much as running streams. Both rivers and lochs water the flax quicker than canals.</P>
<P>But all flax ought to be watered in canals, which should be digged in clay ground if pos|sible, as that soil retains the water best: but if a firm retentive soil cannot be got, the bottom or sides of the canal, or both the bottom and sides, may be lined with clay, or instead of lining the sides with clay, which might fall down, a ditch may be dug without the canal, and filled with clay, which will prevent both extraneous water from entering, and the water within from running off.</P>
<P>A canal of forty feet long, six broad and four deep, will generally water the growth of an acre of flax.</P>
<P>It ought to be filled with fresh soft water from a river or brook, if possible two or three weeks before the flax is put in, and exposed all that time to the heat of the sun. The greater way the river or brook has run, the softer, and therefore the better will the water be. Springs, or short runs from hills, are too cold, unless the water is allowed to stand long in the canal. Water from coal or iron, is very bad for flax. A little of the
<PB N="22" REF="015597_0028_0F998E16232E1698">
powder of galls thrown into a glass of water, will immediately discover if it comes from mi|nerals of that kind, by turning it into a dark colour, more or less tinged in proportion to the quantity of vitriol it contains.</P>
<P>The canal ought not to be under any shade; which, besides keeping the sun from softening the water, might make part of the canal cooler than other parts, and so water the flax une|qually. The flax-raiser will observe, when the water is brought to a proper heat, that small plants will be rising quickly in it, num|bers of small insects and reptiles will be gene|rating there, and bubbles of air rising on the surface. If no such signs appear, the water must not be warm enough, or is otherwise un|fit for flax.</P>
<P>Moss-holes, when neither too deep nor too shallow, frequently answer very well for water|ing flax, when the water is proper, as before described.</P>
<P>The proper season for watering flax is, from the end of July to the end of August.</P>
<P>The advantage of watering flax as soon as possible, after pulling, has been already menti|oned.</P>
<P>The flax being sorted after rippling as before mentioned, should next be put in beets, ne|ver larger than a man can grasp with both his hands, and tied very slack, with a band of a few stalks. Dried rushes answer exceedingly well for binding flax, as they do not rot in the
<PB N="23" REF="015597_0029_0F998E1741354F98">
water, and may be dried and kept for use again.</P>
<P>The beets should be put into the canals slope-ways, or half standing upon end, the root-end uppermost. Upon the crop-ends, when up|permost, there frequently breeds a deal of ver|min, destructive of the flax, which is effectually prevented by putting the crop end down-most.</P>
<P>The whole flax in the canal ought to be care|fully covered from the sun with divots (or sods;) the grassy side of which should be next the flax, to keep it clean. If it is not thus covered, the sun will discolour the flax, though quite cover|ed with water. If the divots are not weighty enough to keep the flax enirely under water, a few stones may be laid above them. But the flax should not be pressed to the bottom.</P>
<P>When the flax is sufficiently watered, it feels soft to the grip, and the <HI>harle</HI> parts easily with the <HI>boon</HI> or <HI>show,</HI> which last is then become brittle, and looks whitish. When these signs are found, the flax should be taken out of the water, beet after beet; each gently rinsed in the water, to cleanse it of the nasti|ness which has gathered about it in the canal; and as the lint is then very tender, and the beet slackly tied, it must be carefully and gent|ly handled.</P>
<P>Great care ought to be taken that no par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is overdone; and as the coarsest waters soonest, if different kinds be mixed together, a part will be rotted, when the rest is not sufficiently watered.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015597_0030_0F998E175A08C3B0">When lint taken out of the canal is not found sufficiently watered, it may be laid in a heap, for twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four hours, which will have an effect like more watering; but this operation is nice, and may prove dangerous in unskilful hands.</P>
<P>After the flax is taken out of the canal, fresh lint should not be put a second time into it, until the former water be run off, and the canal cleaned, and supplied with fresh water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of grassing <HI>FLAX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHORT heath is the best field for grassing flax, as, when wet, it fastens to the heath, and is thereby prevented from being blown away by the wind. The heath also keeps it a little above the earth, and so exposes it the more equally to the weather. When such heath is not to be got, links, or clean old lea-ground is the next best. Long grass-grounds should be avoided, as the grass growing thro' the lint frequently spots, tenders, or rots it; and grounds exposed to violent winds should also be avoided.</P>
<P>The flax, when taken out of the water, must be spread very thin upon the ground; and being then very tender, it must be gently handled. The thinner it is spread the better, as it is then the more equally exposed to the weather. But it ought never to be spread during a heavy shower, as that would wash and waste the harle too much, which is then excessively
<PB N="25" REF="015597_0031_0F998E1B11F555F8">
tender, but soon after becomes firm enough to bear the rains, which, with the open air and sunshine, cleans, softens, and purifies the harle to the degree wanted, and makes it blister from the boon. In short, after the flax has got a little firmness by being a few hours spread in dry weather, the more rain and sunshine it gets the better.</P>
<P>If there be little danger of high winds car|rying off the flax, it will be much the better of being turned about once a-week. If it is not to be turned, it ought to be very thin spread. The spreading of flax and hemp requires a deal of ground, and enriches it greatly.</P>
<P>The skilful flax-raiser spreads his first row of flax at the end of the field opposite to the point from whence the most violent wind commonly comes, placing the root-ends foremost; he makes the root-ends of every other row overlap the crop-ends of the former row three or four inches, and binds down the last row with a rope; by which means the wind does not easily get below the lint to blow it away: and as the crop-ends are seldom so fully watered as the root-ends, the aforesaid overlapping has an effect like giving the crop-ends more watering. Ex|perience only can fully teach a person the signs of flax being sufficiently grassed: then it is of a clearer colour than formerly; the harle is blis|tered up, and easily parts with the boon, which is then become very brittle. The whole should be sufficiently grassed before any of it is lifted; for if a part be lifted sooner than the rest, that
<PB N="26" REF="015597_0032_0F998E1B2184C7B0">
which remains is in great danger from the winds.</P>
<P>A dry day ought to be taken for taking up the flax; and if there is no appearance of high wind, it should be loosed from the heath or grass, and left loose for some hours, to make it thoroughly dry.</P>
<P>As a great quantity of flax can scarcely be all equally watered and grassed, and as the different qualities will best appear at lifting the flax off the grass; therefore at that time each different kind should be gathered together, and kept by itself; that is, all of the same colour, length, and quality.</P>
<P>The smaller the beets lint is made up in, the better for drying, and the more convenient for slacking, housing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in making up these beets, as in every other operation upon flax, it is of great consequence that the lint be laid together as it grew, the root-ends together, and the crop-ends together.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of keeping <HI>FLAX</HI> after it is grassed.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING needs be said here, but that if the flax is to be stacked, it should be set in an airy place, upon a dry found|ation, such as pob-middings, (the refuse of the Flax) or the like, and well covered from the weather; and if housed, the floor must be dry, and the house well aired, and water-tight.</P>

<P>The advantage of having both a crop of flax and a crop of turnip the same year&mdash;or of sow|ing grass-seeds along with the lintseed&mdash;and of reducing the ground to a fine garden mould, free of weeds, ought to be attended to.</P>

<P>THE ground must be a rich light soil, ra|ther sandy, but cannot be too rich.</P>
<P>It ought to be ploughed in September, or the beginning of October, first putting a lit|tle hot rotten dung upon it.</P>
<P>Second ploughing in January after a hard frost; and when you intend to sow it, plough it a third time, or rather hoe it, reducing the clods very fine; but make no furrows: the land must be made level like a garden; but never work the land when wet.</P>
<P>The seed should be sown the beginning of April, and about double the quantity that is generally sown by our farmers; if the land be very rich, it will require rather more than double.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="015597_0035_0F998E1E805FBFB8">As soon as sown (if the weather be dry) it will be necessary to roll the ground.</P>
<P>The lint must be weeded very clean when about three inches high; directly after which you must set forked sticks, of about one and half inch thick (which ought to be prepared before) every four or five feet, according to the length of the poles you are to lay upon them; they should be well fixed in the ground, the forked part to receive the poles about six or seven inches above the lint; each row of poles should be two, three, or four feet asunder, ac|cording to the length of the brushwood you are to lay upon them.</P>
<P>The poles ought to be from ten to fifteen feet long, and strong enough to support the brush across the poles; take the longest brush|wood you can get, the more branchy the bet|ter, very thick, filling up the vacancies with smaller brush, and any of the branches that rise higher than eighteen or twenty inches ought to be lopt off to make the brush lie as level as possible: any sort of brush will do except oak, as that tinges the lint.</P>
<P>Your lint must be pulled as soon as the seed is fully formed, which is a few days after it is out of the bloom before the lint turn yellow.</P>
<P>It must be pulled above the brushwood, and every handful laid upon it as soon as possible: if it is fine weather, leave it four or five hours in that manner; then carry it to a screen near a barn, to put it under cover in case of rain; there it must be spread four or five days, and
<PB N="30" REF="015597_0036_0F998E1F04D3B7C0">
always put in the barn at night, or when it ap|pears to rain: the bundles must be opened in in the barn, or made hollow to prevent it from heating.</P>
<P>These operations must be performed until the lint is perfectly dry, and out of danger of heating; taking care all the time to keep the roots as even as possible, and if possible, keep it from rain or wet: if you cannnot prevent it from being wet, it will be better to leave it on the grass 'till dry; because when once wet, the putting it under cover before dry will make it turn black; a thing which must be prevented at all events.</P>
<P>If any of the lint upon the border, or through the piece of ground, be coarser than another, it must be separated from the rest.</P>
<P>The utmost care must be taken to preserve the lint entire, or unbroke; for this reason they beat off the seed with a round mell (mallet) or bittle.</P>
<P>The most proper ground is summer fallow, or after potatoes, or lea; if possible near a wood, to prevent the expence of carrying brush.</P>
<P>As soon as the seed is off, if you intend to water it that season, it must be tied in bundles about as large as you can grasp with your two hands.</P>
<P>The water proper for it, is a very small rivu|let or soft spring free of any metallic ore, and taking care that no flood of foul water enters your pit; which must be at least five feet deep, about nine or ten broad at the top, and seven
<PB N="31" REF="015597_0037_0F998E1FA1930050">
or eight at the bottom, the length will depend on the quantity of flax you have to water. A very small stripe of water, when clear, should always be running in and off from your pit when the lint is in it.</P>
<P>The pit ought to be made three or four months before it be used.</P>
<P>You must drive poles about four inches thick, with a hook inclining downwards, in this form 7, all along the sides of the pit, about five feet asunder. The hooks must be level, or rather under the surface of the water. A long pole, the whole length of the pit, must be fixed into these hooks on each side; and cross poles put under that, to keep the lint under water; but, the cross poles are not used till the lint is put in. You must order it so, that all the lint should be three or four inches under water. You next bring your lint to the sides of the pit; then put your sheaves head to head, causing each over-lap the other about one third, and take as many of these as make a bundle of two, or two and a half feet broad, laying the one above the other, till it is about four or four and a half feet high; then you tie them together in the middle, and at each root-end: after this, you wrap your bundle in straw, and lay it in the water, putting the thin or broad side un|dermost, taking care that none of your lint touch the earth; after it is fully pressed under water, put in your cross poles to keep it under. The bundles ought to lie in the pit a foot sepa|rate from each other. This renders it easy to
<PB N="32" REF="015597_0038_0F998E205D28FF10">
take out; for, if the bundles entangle, they will be too heavy to raise.</P>
<P>The time of watering depends so much upon the weather, and softness or hardness of the water, that it is impossible to fix any certain time. This must be left to the skill of the far|mer. If the flax be intended for spinning yarn soft and fit for cambrick, it ought to be spread upon short grass for four or five days before you put it into the water; but if for lawns, lace, or thread, it is best to dry it outright. In either case, avoid as much as possible to let it get rain; as much rain blanches and washes out the oil, which is necessary to preserve the strength.</P>
<P>The great property of this flax is to be fine and long. Thick sowing raises all plants fine and slender, and when the ground is very rich, it forces them to a great length. Pulling green prevents that c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rse hardness which flax has when let stand till it be full ripe, and gives it the fine silky property. The brushwood, when the flax springs up, catches it by the middle, prevents it from lying down and rotting; in|fallible consequences of sowing thick upon rich ground. It likewise keeps it straight, moist, and soft at the roots; and by keeping it warm, and shaded from the sun, greatly promotes its length. The keeping it from rain, hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, taking proper care of your water, preserves the colour, and prevents these bars in cloth so much complained off by bleachers.</P>

<HEAD>THE MANNER OF DRESSING FLAX. The different methods of that operation.</HEAD>
<P>FOR many ages it was the practice to sepa|rate the boon or core from the flax, which is the bark of the plant, by the following simple <HI>hand methods.</HI> First, for breaking the boon; the stalks in small parcels were beat with a mallet; or more dexterously, the <HI>break</HI> (See the copper-plate figure 1. and 2.) was used thus: The flax being held in the left-hand a-cross the three <HI>under-teeth or swords</HI> of the break (A, fig. 1. and <HI>a,</HI> fig. 2.), the <HI>upper teeth</HI> (B, fig. 1. and <HI>b,</HI> fig. 2.) were with the right-hand quickly and often forced down upon the flax, which was artfully shifted and turned with the left-hand. Next, for clearing the flax of the broken boon; the workman with his left-hand held the flax over the <HI>stock</HI> (fig. 3. and 4.) while with his right-hand he struck or threshed the flax with the <HI>scutcher</HI> (fig. 5.)</P>
<P>These methods of breaking and scutching the flax being slow and very laborious, a <HI>water|mill</HI> was invented in Scotland about forty years ago, which, with some late improvements,
<PB N="34" REF="015597_0041_0F998E22C5F7E888">
makes great dispatch, and in skilful and care|ful hands gives satisfaction. It has been gene|rally constructed to break the boon by three dented-rollers, placed one above the other. The middle one of which being forced quickly round takes the other two along with it, and one end of the handfuls of the flax being by the workman directed in between the upper and middle rollers, the flax is immediately drawn in by the rollers; a curved board or plate of tin behind the rollers directs the flax to return again between the middle and undermost rollers;&mdash; and thus the operation is repeated until the boon be sufficiently broke. Great weights of timber or stone at the ends of levers, press the upper and under-rollers towards the middle one.</P>
<P>The scutching is next carried on by the mill in the following manner: Four arms, some|thing like the hand-scutchers before described, project from a perpendicular axle; a box around the axle incloses these projecting scutchers; and this box is divided among the workmen, each having sufficient room to stand and handle his flax, which, through slits in the upper-part and sides of the box, they hold in to the stroke of the scutchers; which, moving round horizon|tally, strike the flax a-cross or at right angles, and so thresh out or clear it of the boon.</P>
<P>The breaking of the flax by <HI>rollers</HI> is scarcely subject to any objection, but that it is dan|gerous to work-men not sufficiently on their guard, who sometimes allow the rollers to take hold of their fingers, and thereby their whole arm is instantly drawn in: thus many have lost
<PB N="35" REF="015597_0042_0F998E246C8F49A0">
their arms. To avoid this danger, a break upon the general principles of the hand-break before described, has been lately adapted to wa|ter machinery, and used in place of rollers. The horizontal stroke of the scutchers was long thought too severe, and wasteful of the flax; but very careful experiments have discovered that the waste complained of must be charged to the unskilfulness or negligence of the work|men, as in good hands the mill carries away no|thing but what, if not so scutched off, must be taken off in the heckling with more loss both of time and flax. But to obviate this objection of the violence of the <HI>horizontal scutchers,</HI> an imitation of hand-scutching has lately been ap|plied to water. The scutchers then project from an horizontal axle, and move like the arms of a check-reel, striking the flax neither across nor perpendicularly down, but sloping in upon the parcel exactly as the flax is struck by the hand scutcher. This sloping stroke is got by raising the scutching-stock some inches higher than the center of the axle; and by rais|ing or lowering the stock, over which the flax is held, or screwing it nearer to or farther from the scutchers, the workman can temper or hu|mour the stroke almost as he pleases.</P>
<P>A lint-mill with horizontal scutchers upon a perpendicular axle, requires a house of two stories, the rollers or break being placed in the ground story, and the scutchers in the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st above; but a mill with vertical scutchers on an hori|zontal
<PB N="36" REF="015597_0043_0F998E24DCB0DD28">
axle, requires but one ground story for all the machinery.</P>
<P>Another method of breaking and scutching flax, more expeditious than the old hand-methods, and more gentle than water mills, has also been lately invented in Scotland. It is much like the break and scutcher giving the sloping stroke last described, moved by the foot. The treddle is remarkably long, and the scutchers are fixed upon the rim of a fly-wheel. The foot-break is also assisted in its motion by a fly. These foot machines are very useful where there are no water mills, but they are far inferior to the mills in point of expedition.&mdash;</P>
<P>The next operation that flax undergoes after scutching, is heckling. The heckle (See the copper-plate figure 6.) is firmly fixed to a bench before the workman, who strikes the flax upon the teeth of the heckle, and draws it thro' the teeth. To persons unacquainted with that kind of work this may seem a very simple operation; but, in fact, it requires as much practice to acquire the slight of heckling well, and without wasting the flax, as any other operation in the whole manufacture of linen. They use coarser and wider teethed heckles, or finer, according to the quality of the flax; generally putting the flax thro' two heckles, a coarser one first, and next thro' a fine heckle.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="015597_0044_0F998E26139369E0">
<HI>FLAX</HI> for Cambrick and fine Lawn, Thread and Lace, IS dressed in a manner somewhat different. It is not skutched so thoroughly as com|mon flax; which from the skutch pro|ceeds to the heckle, and from that to the spin|ner: whereas this fine flax, after a rough skutch|ing, is scraped and cleansed with a blunt knife upon the workman's-knee covered with his leather apron; from the knife it proceeds to the spinner, who, with a brush made for the purpose, straights and dresses each parcel just before she begins to spin it.</P>

<HEAD>THE MANNER OF RAISING AND DRESSING HEMP.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">N. B. It scarcely differs from the raising and dressing of FLAX, but in the following particulars.</HEAD>
<P>HEMP requires a light, free, dry, dusty, and even a sandy warm soil; which if not naturally rich, must be made so by manure. New broke up ground does not an|swer for hemp, producing it thin and poor upon the stalk. Hemp does well to follow beans. The ground should be ploughed and harrowed three or four times, a fortnight or three weeks intervening between each time. In some parts of Lincoln and Holland the soil is naturally so free and rich, that it will pro|duce hemp constantly year after year without manure. The leaves which fall off the stalk h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lp to manure the ground.

<P>It is sown about the first of May; so thin, that about four p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks are sufficient for an English acre; and the ground must then be covered as much as possible to preserve the seed from the birds, who are very fond of it.</P>

<P>When hemp is the object of the farmer more than a crop of seed, the whole should be pulled when the stalk begins to grow yellow, and the earth remaining about the roots should be beat off to prevent more growth: But if the seed is wanted in its greatest perfection, the stalks bearing the pods must be pulled before the upmost pod begins to open; the earth should not be beat off from the roots; it should be stooked in sheaves upon the field, to dry and win as corn; and the top of these stooks should be covered with undergrowth, or the like, to preserve the seed from the birds.</P>

<HEAD>An Inquiry concerning the <HI>Materials</HI> that may be used in making Paper.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By <HI>Mr. GUETTARD,</HI> of the <HI>Royal Academy</HI> of <HI>Sciences,</HI> and <HI>Physician</HI> to his <HI>Serene Highness</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>ORLEANS.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>PAPER owes its origin to the necessity that mankind were always under to commu|nicate their sentiments even when at a distance from one another; and to the de|sire of transmitting their thoughts to posterity. Flattered with the hopes of procuring by these means a kind of immortality, which would indemnify them for that which nature hath re|fused, they first thought of carving or painting upon the bark or leaves of trees, the characters which they used. The natives of America still use the same expedients; and these may be looked upon as a living proof of what is recorded of the first men of the old world. They found inconvenience in having books composed of small bits of bark strung upon twisted leaves, or on one piece of bark or leaves rolled up; and endeavoured to find another matter which might be more commodiously used. The Egyptians, who were the first people that en|joyed the happiness of a well governed state, were likewise the first who endeavoured to pro|cure this advantage; nevertheless, it was not (according to Pliny) till the time of Alexander's victories, that they made this discovery. They fell upon a method of making, from a kind of
<PB N="42" REF="015597_0048_0F998E2D75FC7EE0">
dog-grass, a substance which soon became a very considerable and lucrative branch of trade; and this manufacture was the first thing that deserved the name of paper. Rome, as much as it was possible, furnished itself with this paper, and as often as the Gauls could procure it, they gave it the preference to the birch-bark: but the difficulty of bringing it from such a distant country as Egypt, weighing too equally against its rare property of taking any desired form, and of being folded together in sheets, the Gauls and other nations endeavoured in like manner to find the means of supplying it among themselves. They accordingly found the method of making it with cotton: and ac|cording to Montfaucon, in his essay upon the Egyptian paper, inserted among those of the academy of the belles lettres, at the end of the ninth or beginning of the tenth century, this destroyed the Egyptian paper manufacture through all the east; and this discovery led to that of our paper, which is made of rags, the aera of which, as settled by Montfaucon, in the aforesaid essay, is in the twelfth century. Yet long before that period, the Chinese (ac|cording to P. du Halde) made it with cotton rags. That author says, in the article of Chinese paper, that in the 95th year of the Christian aera, a Mandarin of the palace manu|factured paper of the bark of different trees, old rags of silk and hemp that had been used. Be that as it will, as soon as the rag paper appeared, it ruined the Egyptian paper in the
<PB N="43" REF="015597_0049_0F998E2BFACB25C0">
west, as the cotton-paper had formerly ruined it in the east. We must own however, that the ad|vantages of paper made of rags, ought not to have been so fatal to that of Egypt, but on the contrary engaged their manufacturers to bring it to perfection. Every thing seemed to lead the way. The different kinds of paper had always been made of plants: and although the birch-bark and the prepared leaves, were not properly speaking of that species, yet the facility of fold|ing and rolling, shewed a flexibility in the fibres, capable of that preparation which is given to rags. It may be observed, that these very rags are no other than fibres of a plant which had suffered a kind of decomposition, which had not happened to those that they made use of. It was therefore natural to think, that if they had undergone the same prepara|tion, they would have produced such a paper, or at least a kind that would have resembled our own.</P>
<P>Let us not seek for matter of reproach against the ancients. Their occasions for paper were not probably so pressing as ours; since notwithstanding the quantity of rags which is collected, the price of it sometimes rises so high, that the manufacturers are desirous of finding other materials for the same purpose, or compelled to have recourse to expedients which are prohibited by the regulations touch|ing paper-works, though they always find means to conceal them from the vigilance of the inspectors. When the rags that are pro|per
<PB N="44" REF="015597_0050_0F998E2F71293C50">
for making white paper, become scarce, they employ those which at other times, are used for the coarse paper, and prepare them with chalk-water. By this preparation they consume, and indeed destroy the foreign bodies which are in these coarse materials, but at the same time decompose the fibres of the rags; so that there must certainly be a great waste. If we should do no more then, but find a method for preventing this waste, and procure such materials as the workmen at such times desire to have, should we not gain a great advan|tage to the paper-works? The means that are now prohibited, might be employed after the prohibition is taken off. This new matter might be used for coarse paper, and the other enter into the composition of white paper, and of consequence the price of fine rags would fall, or at least never become excessively dear. In my opinion, therefore, we ought to have been for a long time, employed in search of a remedy for those times of dearth, and in preventing the consequences so naturally drawn from the manner in which we now manufacture our pa|per. It is not from the workmen we are to draw such consequences. He himself who makes any discovery, very rarely perceives all its consequences: the novelty often blinds us, touching what is already discovered, and makes us despise it, instead of engaging us to bring it to perfection. It therefore requires men who, together with a discerning understanding, have a desire to bring the arts to perfection, and to
<PB N="45" REF="015597_0051_0F998E2EF00EA490">
enable mankind to enjoy them at a small ex|pence.</P>
<P>M. de Reaumur, in an essay published in the year 1719, upon wasps, seems to perceive these consequences. Wasps build habitations, the outward parts of which seem to be of paper or strong pasteboard: in such a manner do they prepare bits of rotten wood, as to make them assume that consistence. M. de Reaumur took an hint from this observation, touching the per|fection of paper-works. He in his essay ex|plains his own ideas of that substance, and wishes those who have an opportunity would examine, if it is such as he has conceived it to be: and this subject he has renewed in the sixth volume of his history of insects. Seba likewise, in the first volume of his natural history, has invited the curious to prosecute the same pro|ject, in these words.
<Q>This country does not seem to want trees fit for making paper, if people would give themselves the necessary trouble and expence. <HI>Alga Marina,</HI> for ex|ample, which is composed of long, strong, viscous filaments, might it not be proper for this purpose, as well as the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of Mosco|vy, if they were prepared as the Japonese make their timber? The curious may at least try the experiment.</Q>
Whether there are no people, as Seba demands, who have opportunities of prosecuting this work, or that every body is averse to go to work, except upon his own plan, I know not one author who has communicated any thing upon this subject.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="015597_0052_0F998E30F5C07B98">P. du Halde, in the first volume of his his|tory of China, pretends that the Chinese make paper of the second bark of bamboo, of the bark of different trees, particularly the mul|berry, of straw, rue and hemp. Keempfer, in his voyage to Japan, and after him Seba, in the aforementioned book report that paper is made in that country of the inner bark of a kind of mulberry-tree. M. de la Loubaire says, that the Siamese make it of old cotton-cloth, or the bark of a tree called <HI>Tonco&euml;.</HI> Flacourt describes the manner in which the in|habitants of Madagascar make theirs of a kind of mallow, which they call <HI>Avo.</HI> Finally, all the travellers to India as well as to America, recount with emphasis, the advantages drawn from the palm tree for making stuffs, of which, when they are worn, it would doubtless be easy to make paper. The opportunity which the paper mills in the neigbourhood of Estampes, which is my native place, seemed to afford me, of fulfilling the wish of some, and verifying what hath been said by others, touching our trees and plants that are analagous to those mentioned by the authors above, has induced me to collect several of these plants. After having surmounted all the difficulties which one always finds among workmen, when he pretends to introduce any novelty relating to their occupation, I have at length, succeeded so far as to have tried some experiments, and fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter myself with being able to continue those which I have in view.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="015597_0053_0F998E3028DB6190">Hitherto I have only spoke, as if paper was made of nothing but vegetable substances, and that no materials could be taken from the ani|mal reign. Nevertheless, it is doubted whe|ther in China paper is not made of silk. Pere du Halde says, that they gather the refused cods, when they are unwound in the silk ma|nufactures, and make paper of them; but, notwithstanding the assertion of that author, the fact has been always considered as proble|matic.</P>
<P>I will relate an experiment which may help to explain this question: but before I describe my success, I believe I had better distinguish the different plants I have mentioned above, and present them in a methodical manner. By these means the public will have a botanical history of paper, and see the plan of the work which I have proposed.</P>
<P>The materials for paper, then, may be di|vided into two general classes, namely, vege|table substances, and those that belong to the animal kingdom.</P>
<P>In the great number, I will even venture to say, in the confusion of plants used for making paper, or of which people suppose it might be made a regular order may be found. People of different countries have been conducted by a kind of natural analogy. They have not sought to employ plants that were very different from those already in use. They have taken them of different classes, in different kinds, but al|ways in some of those which had been before
<PB N="48" REF="015597_0054_0F998E32779A6000">
used, though probably they were ignorant of that circumstance. In effect, the greatest part of plants seem to be composed of long, longitudinal fibres, nearer or closer to one a|nother, and covered with a substance which fills up the intervals: such are the <HI>palmiferous,</HI> the <HI>gramineous</HI> and the <HI>liliaceous.</HI></P>
<P>The class of the <HI>palmiferi</HI> is one of those which have been of most service to the Indians, Asiatics and Americans, in furnishing them with cloathing, cordage, sails and other uten|sils; almost every part of these trees, has serv|ed some of those uses, though they do not in|differently take every part of the same tree. These people have in the palm-tree, which they found among them, chosen what was most susceptible of manufacture. In some they chose the <HI>spatha,</HI> which invelops the <HI>regimen</HI> of fruits before they are ripe, or that which sustains the young leaves: and in others they employed the down which surrounds the fruit. The young and tender leaves have been pre|ferred to this wool or down, which was not considerable in other kinds; and when all these could not be compared to the bark for goodness and quantity, they made use of this last. The down of the fruit of the cocoa-nut-tree, the <HI>spatha,</HI> the leaves and bark have been used, as several travellers relate. Rumphius, in his history of the plants of Amboyna, says as much of the <HI>calapa:</HI> the <HI>pinanga,</HI> the wild <HI>lontarus,</HI> the <HI>tetum,</HI> the <HI>hakum,</HI> the <HI>wanga,</HI> all different kinds of the palm-tree, furnish in their
<PB N="49" REF="015597_0055_0F998E33D6BCADC0">
leaves, a thread more or less fine, of which those people make stuffs. They have even prepared the leaves of the <HI>hakun,</HI> and <HI>soribe,</HI> and used them instead of paper. The advan|tages which the Indians draw from the palm-tree being already sufficiently important, I shall not probably be blamed for not having inserted, in the number of these advantages, what is mentioned by Rai after some authors: he reports, tome 2. page 358. of his history of plants, that the cocoa-tree contains, in lieu of pith, a quire of paper of fifty or sixty sheets, on which people may write. This is like that which is found in the middle of a fruit of Peru, mentioned by Mr. Frezier, author of a voyage to the South-sea. All this wonderful phaenomenon, when reduced to its just value, is in my opinion, no more than that the pith of the palm-tree, and the pulp of that fruit, may be easily made into sheets in the same manner as that of the Chinese elder, which is made into those fine artificial flowers that are brought from that country, or the books made of the roots of a kind of mallow, which requires no more than to be artfully dried, and cut in leaves. The <HI>musa</HI> or banana tree has been em|ployed for the same or such like purposes.</P>
<P>The class of the <HI>liliaceous</HI> includes the aloes, the <HI>yucca:</HI> from the aloes is obtained the thread of <HI>pitte,</HI> known by the use to which it is put. Father <HI>du Tertre,</HI> in his natural history of the Antilles, describes the manner in which that thread is got. Sir Hans Sloane, in his ca|talogue
<PB N="50" REF="015597_0056_0F998E33E849ACC8">
of the plants of Jamaica, likewise men|tions these aloes. In the number of synoni|mous names which he recites, some of them are taken from the use that is made of those plants, and which I cannot help, for that rea|son, repeating in this place. The second spe|cies of that author is by Gaspar Bauhin, in his <HI>Pinax,</HI> p. 20. called the eleventh species of <HI>papyrus,</HI> employed for paper. Clusius, in his treatise of exotic plants, p. 6. mentions a ball of thread made of the bark of a tree, which, according to Sloane, is this aloes. John Bauhin, tome. I. p. 384, copies Clusius, and says this thread is very fine and extremely white. The third species of aloes, according to Sloane, which nevertheless is a true species of <HI>yucca,</HI> is known in <HI>Luet,</HI> p. 645, under the name of an excellent kind of hemp or flax, which even approaches very near to the fineness of silk.</P>
<P>Seba, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the first volume of his work, has given the figure of two leaves of a plant, which he calls the aquatic bullrush of Surinam, com|posed of innumerable threads or fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aments. This bullrush, says that author, ought to be exam|ined with regard to its utility.</P>
<P>It was from the <HI>gramineous</HI> class, as I have al|ready said, that they obtained materials for the first paper which deserves that name. Michili, in his new genera of plants, has inserted, in the number of rushes, the plant called by Gaspar Bauhin, in his <HI>Pinax,</HI> p. 19. and in his theatre of plants, p. 333. <HI>the paper of Syria or Sicily.</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="015597_0057_0F998E349CE70088">
Is this the species formerly employed in Egypt? The figure and description of it given by Prosper Alpinus, namely that of Ves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ingius and the ancients, leave it doubtful whither this last plant be a rush or not. Prosper Alpinus says it is the paper called <HI>beid</HI> by the Egyptians. M. de Jussieu, at whose house people will always find lights in all doubts that can occur upon these subjects, and who finds pleasure in com|municating instruction, hath shewn me an Egyptian plant that seems to be a true rush, and when compared with that of Michili, ex|hibits no difference.</P>
<P>Dodo considers the flag as a plant proper for paper, and gives it the name of Papyrus. I have observed above, that Pere du Halde says the Chinese made paper of straw or the blade of rice.

As the word bark may be deemed equivocal, it will not be amiss in this place to fix its signification.

<PB N="52" REF="015597_0058_0F998E35845A0B50">
sense it ought to be understood in those authors who treat of the different kinds of paper used by different nations. Most of these writers say, it is the second bark which is used. Others have only said, that they used the bark; but the preparations which they describe, plainly shew that it was this inner part which was em|ployed. I should deviate too much from the plan I proposed to myself in this essay, to men|tion the methods of this preparation. Rumphiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> describes two trees with cats-tail flowers, one of which he calls the <HI>domesticum gnemon,</HI> and the other <HI>gnemon campestre.</HI> The inhabitants of Amboyna, according to that author, obtain a thread from the bark of the boughs, which they beat a little, and this thread is proper for making nets, which they boil in a certain in|fusion, to make them stronger and less apt to rot in the water. This ought the more care|fully to be examined, as the knowledge derived from such enquiry, may serve to bring to per|fection the cordage of ships, as well as that of which the fishers make their nets.</P>
<P>Here we ought to recal the idea which M. de Reaumur has produced upon the subject of rotten wood, an idea so much the more happy as it furnishes others upon abundance of sub|stances easily got: the forests present but too many of them sometimes. The shops of our carpenters supply us with cuttings which, by their thinness are in a condition to undergo, in a little time, the necessary degree of rottenness; for here, as in every other thing, there is a
<PB N="53" REF="015597_0059_0F998E361C5E3118">
proper degree which must be laid hold on. When the wood is too rotten, its fibres are too much divided, they have lost that binding which connects their parts, they become too earthy, and I believe it would then be difficult, not to say impossible, to bind them together: therefore, the wasps do not use indifferently all sorts of rotten wood, but know how to distinguish that which is proper for their pur|pose.</P>
<P>The nettle, the mulberry and the hemp are ranked in a class which is called <HI>incompleat,</HI> because these plants want the flower, or the <HI>calix</HI> or the <HI>petalae,</HI> or both these parts.</P>
<P>Kempfer, in his catalogue of the plants of Ja|pan, mentions one which in the Japonese idiom is called white hemp, and to which that au|thor has given the appellation of the great common nettle, which bears real flowers, and yields strong thread proper for linen and other works. The same author calls the mulberry which is employed for paper, the Papyrus, whose fruit resembles that of the mulberry, and whose bark is made into paper. Seba has given it the name of the mulberry-tree, which affords paper, and is cultivated at Japan. Pere du Halde says, tome 2. page 212. that before the mulberry branches, with whose leaves the Chinese feed their silk worms, are destined to the fire, some people strip off the thin bark from these branches, and make of it a kind of paper, which is strong enough to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver their ordinary umbrellas, especially when it is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led
<PB N="54" REF="015597_0060_0F998E36DCFE6CA0">
and coloured. I do not here join the other plant which the Japonese employ, because Kempfer leaves it uncertain under what class it ought to be ranged. He calls it the Papyrus which lies upon the ground, yields milk, has plated leaves, and a bark proper for making paper. For the same reason I likewise mention here a tree which Sloane calls the tree with broad, long, jagged, smooth shining leaves, like those of the laurel, whose interior rind may be extended into a fine cloth like muslin for ruffles; this tree is commonly called <HI>Lagetto.</HI> Tome 2. tab. 168, 169. The people among whom this tree is found, make cloaths of it. It is needless to mention the use of hemp in making paper, every body knows we use it for that purpose; but hitherto no paper has been made of hemp, until it had passed thro' the state of rags. Yet Pere du Halde reports, that at Nangha, paper is made of hemp beaten and mixed with lime water, tome 4. page 373. And this confirms me in the notion I entertain|ed, that the stalks, or what falls upon the form in dressing hemp or flax, might serve for the same purpose. I shall speak of this below.</P>
<P>The <HI>malvaceous</HI> species dispute the prefe|rence with all the other classes, for this kind of employment. All the kinds of the <HI>mahot</HI> yield a sort of thread proper for cordage. Sloane men|tions two mallows, one of which he names the mallow-tree on the sea-shore, with round, small, prickly leaves, white below, which bears a yellow flower, and a bark that may be
<PB N="55" REF="015597_0061_0F998E37A4E436C0">
made into thread. Catalogue of the Jamaica plants, p. 95. This is one of the <HI>mahots</HI> of father du Tertre. The other is mentioned by the name of the mallow-tree with round leaves, a very large flower of a fine red colour, like the flower de lys, and a bark which yields thread. Ibid. This is another of du Tertre's <HI>mahots.</HI> It would be unnecessary to mention the different kinds of cotton which are used in making pa|per. I have observed above, that cotton-paper was invented in the east, and that in China, paper was made of cotton-rags; and indeed these are not neglected even in our manufac|tures. Although I have advanced, that peo|ple have never sought after plants that were far removed from those classes which had been formerly used, I think I ought to except the flax, the linden-tree, and the thistle.</P>
<P>Linen rags have entered and now enter into the composition of paper: The workmen, in picking the rags, reject only those which are produced from woollen stuffs and hides of ani|mals: they pretend that these stuffs cannot be beaten; but this they say, perhaps, because they are beaten with more difficulty than those produced from the fibres of plants, the parts of which are more easily divided. They do not reject the others in those paper-works where coarse grey paper is made; the business then is to have a very fine paste, and the hair may be beaten sufficiently, to incorporate with the fibres of other rags, although they may not be so well bruised.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="015597_0062_0F998E385D963418">Veslingius, in his little treatise upon the uti|lity of cultivating plants, pretends that the down of certain thistles has been used in mak|ing stuffs: <HI>ex acantii lanugine demptis spinis, vestes effecerunt,</HI> says that author. By the word <HI>acantium</HI> we must understand a kind of thistle. The ancients often employed the word in this signification. The linden-tree was and is used in making ropes, a circumstance that denotes a flexibility in the fibres of that tree, capa|ble of undergoing the necessary preparation for making paper.</P>
<P>What Veslingius, whom I have mentioned, has writ concerning the <HI>luffa arabum,</HI> which may be considered as a kind of cucumber, ought to induce us to examine several plants. He says, that the inside of the fruit, when the seeds are taken out, is no other than a little net which seems to be made of flax; whence he conjectures it would yield a thread like that which the Ethiopians and Indians, according to Theophrastus, made of their cotton-apples, and the Arabians, according to Pliny, of their gourds.</P>
<P>I know no author but Seba who has sus|pected that paper might be made of sea-plants, and <HI>alga marina.</HI> When I read that part, I re|collected that I had been struck with the white|ness which it will assume, bleached no doubt by the spray of the sea-water, by the rains and dews, and losing that glew with which all the marine plants are covered. Upon the sea-coasts the <HI>fucus</HI> is used for dunging the vines and cir|cumjacent
<PB N="57" REF="015597_0063_0F998E3D2A5163A8">
lands; and I have observed that this, when transported to the grounds, likewise acquires a certain degree of whiteness, and, like the <HI>alga,</HI> preserves its figure, together with a strong consistence: nothing is so common on the sea-shore as the <HI>fucus,</HI> which in some places covers the coast, and nothing can be more easily collected.</P>
<P>There is another plant which is likewise found on the sea-shore, but more commonly in ponds, and the basins of gardens; it is the <HI>conferva</HI> of Plini, and in some authors bears a name that seems to promise considerable utility. Imperatus calls it the sea-flax. Loesel, in his catalogue of the plants in Prussia, gives it the name of aquatic moss, composed of very fine silky filaments. I can scarce doubt that some people have attempted to spin this plant. When it is wet, it has a flexibility that de|ceives people, and the great quantity of it found in those places that favour its multipli|cation, and by which means the fibres are in|terwoven in such a manner as to produce a kind of stuff like coarse camblet, must have more than once induced people to try to make the plant useful in the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. I know that a great princess, struck with the quantity and fineness of this plant, was desirous of having it spun; but it becomes too brittle when out of the water, to be susceptible of this operation. I shall, in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quel, relate the success I had in treating it, with a view to the paper manufacture.</P>
<P>I thought it necessary to enter into a circum|stantial detail of the plants which have been
<PB N="58" REF="015597_0064_0F998E3F14998388">
used in the composition of paper, and those which may be used for that purpose, in order to give, as I before observed, a botanical history of that manufacture, and explain the plan of the work which I have laid down: and by the different classes which I have described, the public sees the plants of our country which re|late to it. At the same time it must be owned, that some of these classes are not so rich here as in foreign countries. We are altogether strangers to the class of the <HI>palmiferi</HI>; but, by way of recompence, the gramineous class is in greater abundance. The course of some rivers is re|tarded by a kind of forest of reeds, rushes and flags; and in some places nothing is so com|mon as mallows: there is scarce a person among us, who is not sometimes incommoded by the quantity of nettles and thistles. Cotton is nothing but a kind of down that surrounds the grain of that plant. I have therefore in|cluded in my project, the down of different plants, such as that of willows and <HI>linagrostis.</HI> The grounds planted with willows, are covered at one season with the fall of the cats-tails of these trees; and some meadows, especially those that are barren, are full of the <HI>linagrostis.</HI></P>
<P>The stalks of hemp and flax are composed of two parts, the filamentous and that which partakes of the nature of pith. We cannot possibly doubt the utility of the first, which in|deed composes our paper. Nevertheless, this thread is rejected as useless. It would there|fore be a great advantage to render that part useful, even though the other never could
<PB N="59" REF="015597_0065_0F998E406E7981B8">
serve any purpose. What prodigious quanti|ties of materials would be acquired by these means! We know how much hemp is brought from Berry and Champaign. In the rope-works, and especially those of the arsenals belonging to our sea-ports, great resources will be found; they are now made into tow, which often amounts to such a quantity, that they are obliged to throw it away, or make use of it as dung for the beds in their garden; in all the lower Poictiers there is scarce a peasant who does not reserve a piece of ground for flax seed.</P>
<P>It is not therefore for want of materials that we do not endeavour to procure a paper which may vie in beauty with our white paper, or at least furnish us with a kind proper for covers of bundles. Perhaps I may be thought to have found too many plants susceptible of this operation, and seem inclined to transform every thing into paper. Although what I have related of foreign plants may be a preju|dice strong enough to inspire a notion of the utility we may reap from our own plants, I know at the same time, we may be imposed upon by analogy, which is always deceitful. In other respects, the experiments which I have made, although far from that perfection to which I wish we could attain, give reason to hope that one day we may acquire a certain degree of that perfection. Thinking I ought first of all to examine the stalks of hemp as the most common materials, and those from which I
<PB N="60" REF="015597_0066_0F998E409C40C1F0">
thought I had reason to expect some success, I caused them to be steeped in water for a certain time, that they might acquire a degree of rottenness which would facilitate their tritu|ration. When they were supposed to be suf|ficiently rotten they were beaten; but by a mistake, which by the by, I had endeavoured to avoid, these stalks were beaten with mallows and nettles, which I had ordered to be gathered and left to rot in a separate place. Yet these different substances incorporated together: though it must be confessed, that their connex|ion was not very strong, but, on the contrary, produced a very imperfect tissue. I look upon this essay, as scarce deserving to be re|counted; yet it shews that the leaves of plants as well as the filaments may unite and incorpo|rate; and that, if those different parts had been beaten separately, and a proper degree of trituration bestowed upon each, so as to form a well binding paste, something better might have been produced. I will even venture to say, this doubtless would have been the case, hav|ing observed what happens in ponds and marshes. Nature, more tranquil than art, frequently forms a very fine paper of plants that rot in those watry places. I have found, in some of the pools of water of the forest of Dourdan, when they have been entirely dried up, masses of a substance that altogether resem|bles paper. They were composed of several <HI>laminae</HI> or leaves, easily separated from one another. They tore like paper, and though I
<PB N="61" REF="015597_0067_0F998E41BB065230">
could not then determine whether they were formed of rotten leaves, or only a kind of <HI>byssus,</HI> it seemed to me, that if any of this last plant entered its composition, there was like|wise in it part of leaves, trees and other plants. I have not fulfilled the aim which this observation inspired me with; diverted by a variety of other occupations, I could not be|stow upon this work, the time, attention and necessary precision it required. It was more easy for me to repeat the experiment upon hemp alone. I therefore put in water to rot, some very fine hemp well cleaned from the parenchy|matous part or pith that falls from the instru|ment in dressing it. The paper which it pro|duced, was very strong, and convinced me that it was very easy to make it of that part of the hemp which is thrown away in rope-works or other work-houses, where it is dressed, or employed.</P>
<P>The conviction I reaped from this experi|ment, touching the hemp, necessarily influ|enced my notions concerning cotton, that down, much softer and more flexible than hemp, must easily undergo the necessary pre|paration for making paper. I o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght indeed to regard the experiment I made upon cotton as superfluous, after that which I had tried upon hemp; yet as authors, those at least whom I have read, do not say that cotton-paper was made immediately of cotton before it had passed through the state of cloth; and Pere du Halde reports that the Chinese make theirs
<PB N="62" REF="015597_0068_0F998E421F7563F8">
with cotton-rags, I thought proper to remove that doubt intirely; because it seemed to me essential that no scruple should remain with re|gard to that fact; and the success seemed to in|fluence all those parts of plants to which we commonly give the name of down. Of this kind there are several, namely the <HI>linagostis,</HI> the cats-tail of the willow, dogs-bane, and trumpet-wood, which, though not so easily spun as cotton, seem to me susceptible of that consistence which is necessary to the paste or pulp of which paper is made. The cotton being therefore beaten to a sufficient degree, produced a smooth, white paper of a strong texture, which promised to have all the advan|tages of our own.</P>
<P>I will not however pretend to propose it as an advantage, to make paper of cotton. The hemp-rag is a material in our possession, which would be altogether useless if we did not know how to employ it for this purpose; but by know|ing, from this and other experiments, that it is possible to make paper with those different materials, even though they have not passed through an intermediate state, we afford a <HI>succedaneum</HI> to those who are in want of ordi|nary rags, which are not so common as people may imagine, in countries remote from great cities. In some places of our American colo|nies, cotton is more common than hemp-rag, which may be the means of making that trade more lucrative and of greater consequence; but perhaps this is giving views of utility
<PB N="63" REF="015597_0069_0F998E430FAED8C8">
which many other reasons may render useless: besides, to know whether or not it would be used to advantage, would require more deli|cate experiments, and a more minute enquiry touching the price which that paper would bring, and the profit which is acquired in the ordinary cotton trade. I have neither made the calculation nor the experiments that are requi|site; all that I am in search of, is the possibility of the thing: and not its advantages or disadvan|tages. I proceeded then to try the other downs, though I have been able only to examine that of the dogs-bane, called wad; and of the two kinds that are obtained from thistles, that only with seeds of divers kinds which are crowned, but not the kind which the ancients obtained from the leaves which have been mentioned above. This experiment did not succeed so well as that which I made with cotton. The paste formed of the down of these plants, was not of such a good consistence or coherence, as that of the pulp made with cotton: yet, with much care and precaution it was formed into sheets of paper strong enough to be hung upon cords to dry, but very easily torn: the parts did not adhere, they not being sufficiently interwoven and bound together; and without this quality no paper can be good. So great a difference between these kinds of down, may appear singular, but this difficulty will be ex|plained by the following observation. That which is upon wad and thistle, is not properly speaking a down: but formed of a sort of hair
<PB N="64" REF="015597_0070_0F998E43D3BE88F0">
sustained upon the seeds of these plants. These hairs are commonly called, by botanists, <HI>tufts</HI> and <HI>plumes,</HI> because they form upon the seeds a kind of tuft, and many of them push out branches on the sides, by which they resemble real plumes, or feathers. Cotton, on the con|trary, is a down that surrounds the grain, without order or regularity, sticking closely to it, without any constant figure. When this is pulled off, and the seed wiped clean, we can easily perceive that it issues from small points, like so many holes. If this operation is per|formed while the fruit is young, the threads or hairs are found softer and less dry than when it is farther advanced; and it is difficult to refuse the notion, particular as it is, that cotton is no other than a matter which transpires from the seed. When we know what forms the down of certain thistles, which I have mentioned in the beginning of this essay, the singularity of the notion vanishes. The leaves and stalks of thistles are roughened with a quantity of hairs, which are so many pipes giving issue to a clear limpid liquor, a little viscous and glutinous, which dries in the air, and assumes a consist|ence like that of cotton: nay it really is so to such a degree, that when this down is collect|ed, it is easy to form a thread of it, between the fingers: such an observation may perhaps appear very delicate to make, and thence doubt|ful and hazardous: yet it does not require so much attention as people may imagine; all that is necessary is, to procure a microscope with a
<PB N="65" REF="015597_0071_0F998E44709B3CC0">
focus of some inches, to observe the threads and the kind of wheel in which they are formed: and both these being distinguished, you may perceive, by the naked eye, all that passes in this operation of nature. That this may be seen the plainer, you may chuse the <HI>carduus benedictus</HI> of the Parisians, or that which has the round head covered with down. These are, in my opinion, more proper than many others of the same class, for proving this observation. The interior part of the scales that form their head, is provided with an infinite number of glands that filtrate a liquor like that which I have mentioned; and this liquor changes in the air, to threads which form the down that surrounds the heads of those thistles. This will not admit of a moment's doubt, seeing this thread may be perceived forming under the very eye: if we will gradually and cau|tiously separate the scales from one another, we then have the pleasure to see this matter lengthen and extend like a gum, rosin or wax, and in a moment change into white threads resembling those of paper.</P>
<P>Now we perceive the similitude there is between cotton and the wool of thistles, and the difference between both and the pre|tended down of those last, and of wad. The cotton issues from the seeds which it sur|rounds like the wool of thistle heads. And both sweat from certain parts, which may
<PB N="66" REF="015597_0072_0F998E454246FE18">
be considered as a kind of glands. On the contrary, what is supposed to be down in the thistle, consists of parts that are stiff and dry, consequently brittle, easily grouped into little smooth masses, which are not composed of a quantity of small fibres, that partly detaching themselves from one another, form in the cotton and thistle-wool, that softness and flexibility which makes what in these sub|stances, is commonly called the cottoneous part: a quality which renders them easiy to mix together, when they are beaten or pounded, in order to form the paste for pa|per. Most we therefore entirely reject these downs? No, surely. Perhaps, in the twink|ling of an eye, they may be rendered useful. I know it may be difficult to catch that point of view, than which nothing requires so much address in improving the arts; but I shall endeavour, at the end of this essay, to give some hints on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e subject; for it would be very advantageous to find the means of employing a kind of down which is in such abundance, and costs nothing but the trouble of gathering it.</P>
<P>I now proceed to another experiment, which, though unscessful, ought to be re|lated. It was tried upon the <HI>alga marina,</HI> which Seba exhorts us to examine. Under this name is comprehended not only that which is used in packing glass-ware, and wrapping round the bottles of <HI>liqueur</HI> which
<PB N="67" REF="015597_0073_0F998E45DB19ED60">
come from M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pelier, and from thence cal|led the glass-makers weed; I say, not only this is rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded as an <HI>alga,</HI> but likewise the <HI>fucus</HI> or <HI>varus,</HI> which has a better title to the name; since the glass-makers weed is not properly of that species, but of the class of dogs-grass. However, I have always men|tioned it as an <HI>alga,</HI> because it is better kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn by that than the name of <HI>cyperus.</HI> This plant, having been treated like the others I have mentioned, did not form a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te that would cohere in any shape; for its leaves have but few fibres: they are in some sort composed of <HI>parenchymatous</HI> parts, which may be considered as a bundle of small vesicles, the sphericity of which is an obstacle to that union which must obtain among the parts of paper. Two spheres can only touch one another in one point; this is a truth demonstrated in geometry, as well as this other, that plain surfaces may be in con|tact through their whole surfaces; a property which facilitates the intertexture of the parts of cotton and hemp in the composition of paper, and to which the other is an obstacle. To this I likewise attributed the little success I had in an experiment which I made with <HI>corralloids,</HI> a kind of plant of the class of <HI>alga,</HI> which abounds in all our woods, and in some places almost entirely covers the trees and rocks. These plants are in some measure dissolved by the trituration; and when they
<PB N="68" REF="015597_0074_0F998E469B5F1480">
were spread in water, according to the prac|tice of making sheets of paper, they could not be re-united upon the form. The same thing happened to the <HI>conferva</HI> of Pliny, which is also of the same tribe.</P>
<P>It may be considered as a loss to the paper manufacture, that we cannot give a body to these plants when they are triturated. The whiteness they acquire when drying, and their prodigious quantity, make us regret this circumstance, especially if they cannot be employed with success in some other ma|nufacture; and I can easily conceive what impressions the report of the commissioners of the academy must have made upon the minds of those who consulted it about the advantage that might be reaped from a cotto|neous matter they had gathered in the pond of Petz, at the distance of a league and an half from Metz, and was found to be no other than dried <HI>conferva,</HI> which did not de|serve the attention that had been bestowed upon it; for they had already founded great hopes on the discovery relating to the trade of the country.</P>
<P>A substance that might, perhaps, turn out to more advantage, is the cods of common caterpillars, which, in some years, are in such plenty as almost to cover the trees. These cods, though not proper for spinning, may, nevertheless, enter into the composition of paper. The essay which was made, gives
<PB N="69" REF="015597_0075_0F998E47639F9548">
room to hope for the success. In effect, these cods, cleared of the leaves that stuck to them, being beaten, were easily reduced to a kind of pulp, which being spread in the water, was without difficulty collected on the form, and made into sheets of paper that might be brought to a degree of perfection, which it must be owned they had not: nevertheless, though this paper ought rather to be ranked with the coarse brown, than with the white fine sort, it gives room to believe, that it may in time acquire a certain degree of whiteness. Some of the sheets were whiter than others: nay the same sheet was sometimes whiter in one part than ano|ther: and the business will be to find a re|medy for this inconvenience. One of the best (which, by the bye, I could not em|ploy) is, without contradiction, to pound the cods in the ordinary mortars of the mills, or bray them under the cylinder. The quantity of cods gathered by my direction, was not enough to fill the mill-mortar; so that the workman made use of an ordinary mortar, which was attended with too defects. The substance was not beaten uniformly, and the foreign bodies were not discharged. These evils are prevented in the mill. The pestles are always moved equally, or at least more equally th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n with the hand of a workman who uses an ordinary mortar; so that the substance must be more effectually triturated
<PB N="70" REF="015597_0076_0F998E4848F99798">
in the mill. Besides, the mortars of this machine are open on one side, near the bot|tom: this hole is covered with a hair-cloth, the interstices of which are large enough to transmit what has undergone a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ufficient de|gree of trituration. Thus the paste becomes whiter; an advantage we cannot obtain from an ordinary mortar, and which the silk-paper I made could not have: for, some of the sheets were sprink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with several little black points, occasioned by the excrement of the caterpillars, which were interwoven with the silk of the cods: and the water which passes into the mortar of the mill, would have carried off these excrements Nay, perhaps the silk loses a part that serves no purpose but to render the paper of a greyer colour when it continues mixed in the pulp. This part is more easily dissolved and disen|gaged from the paste, by the water that con|tinually runs through the mortars. The small fragments of leaves that may be left after the picking will also be beaten with more difficulty in a common mortar; and the paper will be spoiled by them, as it happened to some sheets of that which we made. This inconvenience would be avoided by putting the cods in the mill mortars, where at least, the leaves would be more easily beaten, and this they might easily be, in the state wherein they appear in the cods. For the caterpillars have divested them of their parenchymatous
<PB N="71" REF="015597_0077_0F998E4D8B453548">
parts on which they feed: and nought re|mains but the fibres, which, by the net|work they form, supported the parenchyma that filled up the interstices. Though these fibres be like those of a tree, they are at the same time more slender and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and have already, by the work of the caterpillars, ac|quired an elaboration which wants only a little of our assistance. The beginning of rottenness might suffice. The preparation given to the rags before they are put under the pestle, is one of the methods that may be the most useful on this occasion. The rags being picked, are cut into small pieces, and laid in heaps, where they grow warm, and acquire a kind of fermentation that gives them a degree of rottenness, which renders them the more fit for trituration. In the opinion of the workmen, this preparation is so indispensibly necessary, that when the rags are clean, and destitute of the grease which is then requisite, they think themselves obliged to supply this defect. The same method may be taken with cods mixed with leaves. These leaves, assisted with a little moisture, will heat and rot to a certain degree, which it is our business to distinguish, that then they may be beaten as easily as the silk.</P>
<P>It were to be wished that these leaves were not mixed with the silk, whereas the greatest part of the cods are composed of them. Yet there are some which consist of pure silk;
<PB N="72" REF="015597_0078_0F998E50495582D8">
and are usually found in the angle formed by the union of two branches. These are no other than threads of silk stretched from one bough to another, in different ways. The others consisting partly of leaves, are placed in the middle of leaves, which after the ca|terpillars have partly consumed, they bind and unite them together; thus forming larger or smaller bundles or pods of the ends of little branches. There is no room to doubt that the silk of other caterpillars might like|wise be employed: the cods of pure silk, and even those that are partly formed of the hair which covers the caterpillars, are equally proper materials for paper: nor should the cods belonging to the caterpillars of the pine-tree, be rejected.</P>
<P>We ought, however, to be sure that it is possible to make paper of silk: but is it made of that substance in China? Though it may appear unnecessary to resolve that question, I will examine the reasons that are advanced to prove that it is not made of silk. It is usually said, that if the Chinese paper, which is pretended to be made of silk, was actually composed of that substance, it would in burn|ing, twist itself different ways, and be shri|velled up like parchment, which is made of prepared sheep-skin; whereas that paper burns as equally as that made of the rags of hemp-cloth and linen. These facts cannot be contradicted; but yet the silk-paper which
<PB N="73" REF="015597_0079_0F998E520786E140">
I made, burned like ordinary paper, though the cods, which were the chief materials, shrunk up in burning, in the same manner as parchment. What, therefore, is the cause of this difference? I believe we must seek for the explanation in the tissue or texture, which is very different in the paper from what it was in the cod. There the threads are long, dis|posed in different manners, so as that one single thread often forms several folds. The fibres of paper are very short, and though differently arranged and bound together, the connexion is not so strong: it is no longer one or several threads of a considerable length. It happens then, that when the cods are burnt, their threads are drawn different ways; those of one surface draw those of another, and therefore, they must twist and turn some|times to one side and sometimes to another. Whereas, the fibres of paper being so short and connected together only by <HI>juxta position,</HI> they must act very little, if any thing at all upon one another, consequently will burn equally. What proves the justness of this ex|plication, is, that in paper there is sometimes one place where the silk has not been well beaten, and is still too much interwoven, and that place always is shrivelled up, in burning. This explanation is (I believe) sufficient to clear up the question relating to silk-paper; and howsoever the Chinese paper may be made, I think we ought to be persuaded that
<PB N="74" REF="015597_0080_0F998E52AFAE15D0">
it is possible to make it of silk. Neither ought we to entertain any doubt about the use to which we might put the stalks of hemp and flax; and I think we have reason to hope, that one day an advantageous use may be found, for the different kinds of down, not only of the cotton of which, it is perhaps very singular to have entertained any suspicion, but also of the thistle, the trumpet-wood, and the wad, which more than any other would merit an happy success, its paper having a gloss and silver brilliancy, which might be of some use in many cases. All that remains, therefore, in order to fulfil our hope of this down as well as of the others, is to find out some method, perhaps very easy and simple, and perhaps for that very reason the more difficult to invent. If, for example, when the materials are ready to be beaten, instead of simple water, we should substitute a gummy or mucilaginous water like that in which have been boiled the parings of leather, roots of marsh-mallows, the great comfrey, or such substances; the paste by these means would be endued with a kind of glue, which might be an expedient by means of which the parts would cohere more strongly; perhaps it would be sufficient to prepare in this manner the water of the tub in which the paste is di|luted when it comes from under the pestle. If notwithstanding this preparation, the paste should not have body enough, perhaps by substituting compression in the room of im|mersion,
<PB N="75" REF="015597_0081_0F998E538D8AB0A8">
which is the ordinary method of forming the sheets of paper, we should be able to render the parts of the paste more co|herent; and I imagine this is the method which must be taken with that cottoneous substance that owes its origin to the <HI>conferva</HI> of Pliny. The heaps formed by the re-union of the different feet of this plant, are already of a certain thickness, and not easily torn; so that in extending the paste made of this plant, we might give what thickness we would, to every sheet, and the compression would af|terwards do the rest. It might be found im|practicable to make sheets as thin as those of ordinary paper: but even, if we could do no more than make pasteboard, it would be an advantage which we ought not to neglect; but on the contrary, prosecute with care. Such examinations have always constituted my desires, since I thought of making expe|riments upon paper. I have not been able hitherto, to accomplish my scheme; but ne|vertheless, I have reason to hope I shall one day see it accomplished. I have the advan|tage of belonging to his serene highness the Duke of Orleans, to whom I have the ho|nour of explaining my notions, and who has permitted me to prosecute, under his eye, the experiments which I have projected, believing that they may be of some advantage to the public: an advantage which is the principal object of that great Prince's thoughts, even in his amusements.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the raising and dressing of <HI>HEMP;</HI> communicated to the <HI>AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,</HI> by <HI>EDWARD ANTIL,</HI> Esquire.</HEAD>
<P>HEMP is one of the most profitable pro|ductions the earth furnishes in northern climates; as it employs a great number of poor people in a very advantageous man|ner, if its manufacture be carried on proper|ly: It may also furnish a ready remittance to the mother country, and become a reciprocal advantage to both; and therefore it becomes worthy of the serious attention of the differ|ent Legislatures of the northern colonies, of every trading man, and of every man, who truly loves his country.</P>
<P>But as the people of America do not ap|pear, from their present management, to be acquainted with the best and most profitable method of cultivating and managing this va|luable plant, I beg leave to inform them of some things that may be of advantage to them.</P>
<P>Whoever would raise Hemp properly and to advantage, should set aside two pieces of ground, of such dimensions each, as he shall be able to cultivate every year, and sow the one whilst he is manuring and preparing the other for the succeeding year's crop; the higher and drier the ground the better, pro|vided
<PB N="77" REF="015597_0083_0F998E5504C18780">
it be well dunged and made strong and mellow; the ground should not be too sloping, lest the good soil be washed away with hard rains; if it droops toward the south, so that it may have the full influence of the sun, it will be an advantage; low, rich, warm, dry grounds will also produce good hemp; but wet land, though never so rich, will by no means do. The ground being prepared and made very mellow; I now come to that part which must be particularly and exactly attended to, since the success of the crop greatly depends upon it. Sometime in May, the ground being moist and in a vegetating state, but by no means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, it must be well ploughed, the furrows clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and even, the soil lying light and mellow; it must be sowed very even with two bushels of seed upon one acre; a man with an iron tooth harrow follows the sower, and harrows in the seed with two horses without any balks, for the less the ground be trampled the better; if harrowing one way be not sufficient to cover the seed, though it would be best if that could be done, it must be cross harrowed. The ground being moist as I said before, but by no means wet so as to clod, which would ruin the crop, the seed will all start and come up together, which is a sure sign of a good crop, and nothing after that, but too much wet, will hurt it: for Hemp thus come up bids defiance to weeds and grass of every kind;
<PB N="77" REF="015597_0084_0F998E55AFAC9AE8">
its growth is so quick and it so effectually shades the ground, that nothing below can rise or shew its head, and it so preserves all the moisture below, that the hotter and dryer the weather the faster it grows. Whereas if the seed be sown, when the ground is dry, the seed that lies deepest where the moisture is, will come up first, and these will shade and starve those that come after, by which means the first comers will be too large, and the last will be much too small, so that the crop will be greatly damaged every way: So much depends upon this one circumstance of sowing the seed when the ground is moist and fit to receive it. The crop thus rightly ma|naged will stand as thick as very good wheat, and be from four to six feet high, according to the strength of the ground; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will not be thicker than a good wheat straw; by this means the Hemp will be the finer, it will yield the greater quantity, and it may be plucked from the ground like flax, which will be a very great saving: But if it be sowed thin, that is one bushel to an acre, which is the common practice, it grows large, the Hemp is harsh and coarse, and then it must be cut with hooks, which occasions great waste, for four or five inches just above ground is left by way of stubble, which con|tains the best and heaviest part of the Hemp.</P>
<P>When the Hemp has got its growth, and is fit to be plucked, which you will know by
<PB N="79" REF="015597_0085_0F998E56945FB6A8">
the under leaves of the carle, or he Hemp, turning yellow and falling off, the sooner it is pulled the better: It must then be bound up with straw bands, in single band sheaves, rather small than large, and each sheaf must be bound in two places; and the sooner it is carried to the water to rot the better: Water rotted Hemp, if it be rightly managed, is every way better than that which is rotted on the ground; there is less waste in it, when it comes to be dressed; it looks brighter and fairer to the eye; it is esteemed to be strong|er and more durable, and it always fetches a better price; besides it is much sooner done, and it is rotted more even and alike, and with greater certainty and exactness. Many peo|ple in America are acquainted with the me|thod of rotting Hemp in water, but as many more are not yet acquainted with it, I shall for their information set down the method of doing it. Hemp may be rotted in stagnated or standing water, such as ponds, pools, or broad deep ditches, and in such water it is generally four or five days and nights a rot|ting, and sometimes longer, according to the heat or coolness of the weather; it may also be rotted in running water as in a brook or river; and in such water three or four days and nights are sufficient, according to the weather; to know whether the Hemp be rotted enough in either case, take a middling handful, out of the middle row, and try with
<PB N="80" REF="015597_0086_0F998E572A154508">
both your hands to snap it asunder, if it breaks easy it is rotted enough, but if it yet appears pretty strong, it is not, and must lie longer, till it breaks with ease, and then it must be taken out and dried as soon as possi|ble; in handling the sheaves, take hold of the bands, and set them up an end against a fence, if one be near, or lay them down up|on the grass, for the water to drain off, and then unbind them carefully, open and spread them to dry thoroughly; then bind them up again and house them in a dry tight place: the reason of handling the Hemp in this careful manner is, that when it is well rotted, whilst it is wet the lint comes off with the least touch, therefore if it be handled roughly, or if while it is wet it be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own into a cart and carried to a distance to be unbound and dried, it would be greatly hurt, and the owner would receive great damage by it, but when it is dry, it is handled with safety.</P>
<P>If the Hemp be rotted in a brook or run|ning water, the sheaves must be laid across the stream, for if they be laid down length|ways with the stream, the current of the water will wash away the lint, and ruin the Hemp. It must be laid down heads and points, two, four, or six thick, according to the depth of the water and the quantity of Hemp; if the bottom of the river be sand, gravel or mud, three good strong stakes must be driven down at each end, above and be|low,
<PB N="81" REF="015597_0087_0F998E58C27E2B18">
and three long strong poles must be laid on the Hemp and fastened well to the stakes, in such manner as to force down the Hemp under water, where it remains till it be rott|ed enough: though if a muddy stream could be avoided it would be best, because it is apt to foul and stain the Hemp. If the bottom of the stream be rocky or stony, so that stakes cannot be drove down to secure the Hemp under water and from floating away, then a rough wall must be made at the lower end of the Hemp, and along the side, to keep it in, and strong poles or rails must be laid upon the top of the Hemp and pretty heavy stones up|on them so as to sink the Hemp under water, where it must lie 'till it be rotted enough.</P>
<P>What Hemp is intended for seed, should be sowed on a piece of ground by itself, which must be made very rich and strong; it must be sowed in ridges six feet wide, and the seed must be of the largest and best sort and sown very thin, at the rate of a peck up|on an acre, or rather six quarts: for the thin|ner it is sown the more it branches, and the more seed it bears; it should be sown some|time the middle of April, and then the seed will not be ripe, till sometime after the other Hemp is done with. If you have no conve|nient place to sow your seed Hemp by itself; then sow a border of six feet wide along the north and west sides of your Hemp field; the reason of sowing your seed Hemp in such
<PB N="82" REF="015597_0088_0F998E598C3292E8">
narrow ridges or borders is that, when the carle or he Hemp is ripe, and has shed its sarina on the simble or female Hemp, by which the seed is impregnated, and the leaves of the carle hemp fall off and the stem grows yellow, you may easily step in along the sides and pull up the carle Hemp without hurting the female, which now begins to branch out, and looks of a deep green colour and very flourishing, and when the seeds be|gin to ripen, which is known by their falling out of their sockets, you may all along both sides bend down the plants and shake out the seed upon a cloth laid on the ground, for as they ripen they scatter upon being shaken by a hard wind, or otherwise; then it must be watched, and the fowls and yellow-birds kept from it, for they are immoderately fond of the seed; as the first ripe seeds are the fullest and best, they are worthy of some pains to save them: and the best way to do that is, to bend down the plants all along, on each side of the border or ridge, as is said above, and shake them over a cloth spread on the ground to receive the seed; if one side of the plant be rooted out of the ground by forcing it down to shake out the seed, there will be no damage, for the seed that remains will ripen notwithstanding; and the plant must thus be shaken every two or three days, 'till all the seed be ripe and thus saved; and this is much better than pulling up the plants
<PB N="83" REF="015597_0089_0F998E5A496C1C00">
by the roots, and shaking them on a barn floor, and then setting them up against a fence or the side of the barn, for the seed to ripen, and shaking them morning and evening on the barn floor; for by this method, which is the common practice, one third of the seed at least never comes to maturity.</P>
<P>It is well known to every farmer, that in the three bread colonies at least, the spring and summer seasons are of late years become very dry, so that a crop of flax is become very precarious, scarcely one year in seven produc|ing a good one. This is a constant com|plaint in the mouth of every husbandman: Now Hemp does not require half the rain that flax does; this is a circumstance that is well worth the notice and attention of every farmer; and therefore by his raising Hemp in the manner before directed, and by pre|paring it in the best manner for spinning and weaving into good cloth, he can with greater certainty supply all the necessary uses of his family; and by selling the overplus, he can purchase such things as his wife and daughters may think convenient on extraordi|nary occasions. This however need not hin|der him from raising some flax every year: But I think that it is more for his interest to fix his chief dependance upon his crop of Hemp, as that is more sure, and every way more profitable, the general run of seasons considered. And let him not be disgusted and
<PB N="84" REF="015597_0090_0F998E5AE32B47D8">
think that I am about to persuade him, his wife and daughters to wear oznabrigs, for I can assure him that I have seen dowlas, which is made of Hemp, worth five and six shillings the yard, which no farmer need be ashamed to wear.</P>
<P>I shall now endeavour to instruct the honest husbandman in a few easy rules, for preparing his Hemp, which he has raised and managed in the manner before directed.</P>
<P>Know then, that the best preparation of Hemp for the manufacturing of cloth is to render it as soft and as fine as possible, without lessening its strength, and the easiest and cheapest way of doing that, is certainly the best. This is to be found out by a variety of trials and experiments; but 'till a better way be discovered, which I hope will not be long first, and with which I should be greatly pleased, take the following method, which is the best I have yet been able to discover.</P>
<P>If you have a large wide kettle, that will take in your Hemp at full length, it will be the better; but if your kettle be small, then you must double your Hemp, but without twisting, only the small ends of every hand must be twisted a little, to keep them whole and from tangling; then first of all lay some smooth sticks down in the bottom of the kettle, so as to lie across one another, three or four layers, according to the bigness and deepness of your kettle; this is to keep the
<PB N="85" REF="015597_0091_0F998E5BAC118268">
Hemp from touching the liquor; then pour some lye of middling strength, half as strong as what you make soap of, gently into the kettle, so much as not to rise up to the top of the sticks, they being kept down to the bottom; then lay in the Hemp, each layer crossing the other so that the steem may rise up through the whole body of the Hemp, which done, cover your kettle as close as you can, and hang it over a very gentle fire, and keep it simmering or stewing, but not boil|ing, so as to raise a good steem for six or eight hours; then take it off, and let it stand covered till it be cool enough to handle; then take out the Hemp, and wring it very care|fully as dry as you well can, and hang it up out of the way of the wind, either in your gar|ret or in your barn, shutting the doors, and there let it remain, turning it now and then till it be perfectly dry; then pack it up in some close dry place, till you want to use it; but you will do well to visit it now and then, least any part of it might be damp and rot. You must know, that wind and air weaken and rot Hemp, flax and thread very much. Then at your leisure, twist up some of the hands, as many as you intend for present use as hard as you can, and with a smart round smooth hand beetle, on a smooth stone, beat and pound each hand by itself all over very well, turning it round from side to side&punc; 'till every part be well bruised; you then untwist it,
<PB N="86" REF="015597_0092_0F998E5C9413C928">
and hatchel it, first thro' a coarse and then thro' a fine hatchel: and remember that hatch|eling must be performed in the same manner as a man would comb a fine head of hair, he begins at the ends below, and as that un|tangles, he rises higher, 'till at last he reaches up to the crown of his head. The first tow makes good ropes for the use of the plantati|on, the second tow will make very good ozna|brigs or coarse sheeting; and the Hemp itself will make excellent linen. The same me|thod of steeming softens flax very much.</P>

<HEAD>THE METHOD OF BLEACHING LINEN-CLOTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE art of bleaching, or whitening linen-cloth, thread, &amp;c. is conducted in the following manner by the Bleachers of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</P>
<P>After the cloth has been sorted into parcels of an equal fineness, as near as can be judged, they are latched, linked, and then steeped. Steeping is the first operation which the cloth undergoes, and is performed in this manner.</P>
<P>The linens are folded up, each piece distinct, and laid in a large wooden vessel; into which is thrown, blood-warm, a sufficient quantity of water, or equal parts of water and lye, which has been used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hite cloth only, or water with rye-meal or bran mixed with it, 'till the whole is thoroughly wet, and the liquor rises over all. Then a cover of wood is laid over the cloth, and that cover is secured with a post betwixt the boards and the joisting, to prevent the cloth from rising during the fer|mentation which ensues. About six hours after the cloth has been steeped in warm
<PB N="88" REF="015597_0094_0F998DA7B0B9E468">
water, and about twelve in cold, bubbles of air arise, a pellicle is formed on the surface of the liquor, and the cloth swells when it is not pressed down. This intestine motion continues from thirty-six to forty eight hours, according to the warmth of the weather; about which time the pellicle or scum begins to fall to the bottom. Before this precipitation happens, the cloth must be taken out; and and the proper time for taking it out, is when no more air-bubbles arise. This is allowed to be the justest guide by the most experienc|ed bleachers.</P>
<P>The cloth is then taken out, well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">insed, disposed regularly by the selvage, and washed in the put-mill to carry off the loose dust. After this it is spread on the field to dry: When thoroughly dried, it is ready for buck|ing; which is the second operation.</P>
<P>Bucking, or the application of salts, is performed in this manner. The first or mo|ther lye, is made in a copper, which we shall suppose, for example, when full, holds 170 Scots gallons of water. The copper is filled three fourths full of water, which is brought to boil: just when it begins, the following proportion of ashes is put into it, viz. 30 lb. of blue, and as much white pearl-ashes; 200 lb. of Marcoft ashes, (or, if they have not these, about 300 lb. of Cashub); 300 lb. of Muscovy, or blanch ashes; the three last ought to be well pounded. This li|quor
<PB N="89" REF="015597_0095_0F998DA8604B9BD0">
is allowed to boil for a quarter of an hour, stirring the ashes from the bottom very often; after which the fire is taken away. The liquor must stand till it has set|tled, which takes at least six hours, and then it is fit for use.</P>
<P>Out of their first, or mother-lye, the se|cond, or that used in bucking, is made in this manner. Into another copper, holding, for example, 40 Scots gallons, are put 38 gallons of water, 2 lb. soft soap, and 2 gal|lons of mother-lye; or, for cheapness, in place of the soap, when they have lye which has been used to white linnen, called white-linen lye, they take 14 gallons of it, leaving out an equal quantity of water. This is called bucking-lye.</P>
<P>After the linens are taken up from the field dry, they are set in the vat or cave, as their large vessel is called, in rows, endwise, that they may be equally wet by the lye; which, made blood-warm, is now thrown on them, and the cloth is afterwards squeezed down by a man with wooden shoes. Each row undergoes the same operation, until the vessel is full, or all the cloth in it. At first the lye is put on milk-warm, and, after standing a little time on the cloth, it is again let off by a cock into the bucking copper, heated to a greater degree, and then put on the cloth again. This course is repeated for six or seven hours, and the degree of heat
<PB N="90" REF="015597_0096_0F998DA9E98C98C0">
gradually increased, till it is, at the last turn or two, thrown on boiling hot. The cloth remains after this for three or four hours in the lye; after which the lye is let off, thrown away, or used in the first buckings, and the cloth goes on to another operation.</P>
<P>It is then carried out, generally early in the morning, spread on the grass, pinned, corded down, exposed to the sun and air, and watered for the first six hours, so often, that it never is allowed to dry. Afterwards it is allowed to lie till dry spots appear before it is watered. After seven at night it gets no more water, unless it be a very drying night. Next day, in the morning and forenoon, it is watered twice or thrice if the day be very dry; but if the weather be not drying, it gets no water: After which it is taken up dry if the green be clean; if not, it is rinsed, mill-washed, and laid out to dry again, to become fit for bucking.</P>
<P>This alternate course of bucking and wa|tering, is performed for the most part, from ten to sixteen times, or more, before the linen is fit for souring; gradually increasing the strength of the lye from the first to the middle bucking, and from that gradually decreasing it till the souring begins. The lyes in the middle buckings are generally about a third stronger than the first and last.</P>
<P>Souring, or the application of acids to cloth, is the fourth operation. It is difficult
<PB N="91" REF="015597_0097_0F998DAAF59679B0">
to say when this operation should commence, and depends mostly on the skill and expe|rience of the bleacher. When the cloth has an equal colour, and is mostly freed from the sprat, or outer bark of the lint, it is then thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it for souring; which is performed in the following manner. Into a large vat or vessel is poured such a quantity of butter milk or sour milk, as will sufficiently wet the first row of cloth; which is tied up in loose folds, and pressed down by two or three men bare|footed. If the milk is thick, about an eighth of water is added to it; if thin, no water. Sours made with bran, or rye-meal and wa|ter, are often used instead of milk, and used milk-warm. Over the first row of cloth a quantity of milk and water is thrown, to be imbibed by the second; and so it is conti|nued till the linen to be soured is sufficiently wet, and the liquor rises over the whole. The cloth is then kept down by covers filled with holes, and secured with a post fixed to the joist, that it may not rise. Some hours after the cloth has been in the sour, air-bubbles arise, a white scum is found on the surface, and an intestine motion goes on in the liquor. In warm weather it appears sooner, is stronger, and ends sooner, than in cold weather. Just before this fermentation, which lasts five or six days, is finished, at which time the scum falls down, the cloth should be taken out, rinsed, mill-washed;
<PB N="92" REF="015597_0098_0F998DAB5B7363B8">
and delivered to the women to be washed with soap and water.</P>
<P>Washing with soap and water, is the fifth operation; and is performed thus. Two women are placed opposite at each tub, which is made of very thick staves, so that the edges, which slope inwards, are about four inches in thickness. A small vessel full of warm water is placed in each tub. The cloth is folded so that the selvage may be first rubbed with soap and warm water length-ways, till it is sufficiently impregnated with it. In this manner all the parcel is rubbed with soap, and afterwards carried to be bucked.</P>
<P>The lye now used has no soap in it, ex|cept what it gets from the cloth; and is equal in strength to the strongest formerly used, or rather stronger, because the cloth is now put in wet. From the former ope|ration these lyes are gradually made stronger, till the cloth seems of an uniform white, nor any darkness or brown colour appears in its ground. After this, the lye is more speedily weakened than it was increased; so that the last which the cloth gets, is weaker than any it got before.</P>
<P>But the management of sours is different; for they are used strongest at first, and de|creased so in strength, that the last sour, considering the cloth is then always taken up wet, may be reckoned to contain three fourths of water.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="015597_0099_0F998DAC2B098848">From the bucking it goes to the watering, as formerly, observing only to overlap the selvages, and tie it down with cords, that it may not tear; then it returns to the sour, milling, washing, bucking, and watering again. These operations succeed one another alternately till the cloth is whitened; at which time it is blued, starched, and dried.</P>
<P>This is the method used in the whitening fine cloths. The following is the method used in the whitening of coarse cloths.</P>
<P>Having sorted the cloths, according to their quality, they are steeped in the same manner as the fine, rinsed, washed in the mill, and dried before boiling.</P>
<P>In this process, boiling supplies the place of bucking, as it takes less time, and conse|quently is thought cheapest. It is done in the following manner: 200 lb. cashub ashes, 100 lb. white Muscovy, and 30 lb. pearl-ashes, boiled in 105 Scots gallons of water for a quarter of an hour, as in the process for the fine cloth, makes the mother or first lye. The cloth-boiler is then to be filled two thirds full with water and mother lye, about nine parts of the former to one of the lat|ter; so that the lye used for boiling the coarse cloth, is about a third weaker than that used in bucking the fine. Such a quantity of cloth is put into the foregoing quantity of lye, when cold, as can be well covered by it. The lye is brought gradually to the boil, and kept boiling for two hours; the cloth

being fixed down all the time, that it does not rise above the liquor. The cloth is then taken out, spread on the field, and watered, as mentioned before in the fine cloth.</P>
<P>As the salts of the lye are not exhausted by this boiling, the same is continued to be used all that day, adding, at each boiling, so much of the mother-lye as will bring it to the same strength as at first. The lye by boiling loses in quantity somewhat betwixt a third and a fourth; and they reckon that in strength it loses about a half, because they find in practice, that adding to it half its for|mer strength in fresh lye, has the same effect on cloth. Therefore some fresh lye, con|taining a fourth part of the water, and the half of the strength of the first lye, makes the se|cond boiler equal in strength to the first. To the third boiler they add somewhat more than the former proportion, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> go on still increasing, gradually to the fourth and fifth, which is as much as can be done in a day. The boiler is then cleaned, and next day they begin with fresh lye. These additions of fresh lye ought always to be made by the master-bleacher, as it requires judgment to to bring succeeding lyes to the same strength as the first.</P>
<P>When the cloth comes to get the second boiling, the lye should be a little stronger, about a thirtieth part, and the deficiencies made up in the same proportion. For six or
<PB N="95" REF="015597_0101_0F998DB07344CD38">
seven boilings, or fewer, if the cloth be thin, the lye is increased in this way, and then gradually diminished till the cloth is fit for souring. The whitest cloth ought always to be boiled first, that it may not be hurt by what goes before.</P>
<P>In this process, if the cloth cannot be got dry for boiling, business does not stop as in the fine; for after the coarse has dreeped on racks made for the purpose, it is boiled, making the lye strong in proportion to the water in the cloth.</P>
<P>The common method of souring coarse linen is, to mix some warm water and bran in the vat, then put a layer of cloth, then more bran, water, and cloth; and so on, till the cave is full. The whole is tramped with mens feet, and fixed as in the former process. A thousand yards of cloth, yard-broad, require betwixt four and six pecks of bran. The cloth generally lies about three nights and two days in the sour. Others prepare their sour twenty-four hours before, by mixing the bran with warm water in a separate vessel; and before pouring it on the cloth, they dilute it with a sufficient quan|tity of water. After the cloth is taken from the sour, it ought to be well washed and rinsed again. It is then given to men to be well soaped on a table, and after|wards rubbed betwixt the rubbing boards. When it comes from them, it should be
<PB N="96" REF="015597_0102_0F998DB1E4E63E48">
well milled, and warm water poured on it all the time, if conveniency will allow of it. Two or three of these rubbings are sufficient, and the cloth very seldom requires more.</P>
<P>The lye, after the souring begins, is de|creased in strength by degrees; and three boilings after that are commonly sufficient to finish the cloth. Afterwards it is starched, blued, dried, and beettled in a machine made for that purpose, which supplies the place of a calender, and is preferred by many to it.</P>
<P>This method used in the bleaching of our coarse cloths, is very like that practised in Ireland for both fine and coarse. The only material difference is, that there the bleachers use no other ashes but the kelp or cashub. A lye is drawn from the former by cold wa|ter, which disolves the salts, and not the sulphureous particles of the kelp ashes. This lye is used till the cloth is half whitened, and then they lay aside the kelp-lye for one made of cashub ashes.</P>
<P>In the preceding history of bleaching we may observe, that it naturally divides itself into several different branches or parts, all tending to give linen the degree of whiteness required. How they effectuate, that comes next to be considered.</P>
<P>The general process of bleeching divides itself into these different parts. 1. Steeping and milling. 2. Bucking and boiling. 3. Al|ternate watering and drying. 4. Souring.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>STEEPING.</HEAD>
<P>GREEN linen, in the different changes which it has undergone before it arrives at that state, contracts a great foulness. This is chiefly communicated to it by the dressing composed of tallow and sowen, which is a kind of flummery made of bran, flour, or oat-meal seeds. The first thing to be done in the bleachfield is to take off all that filth which is foreign to the flax, would blunt the future action of the salts, and might, in un|skilful hands, be fixed in the cloth. This is the design of steeping.</P>
<P>To accomplish this end, the cloth is laid to steep in blood-warm water. A smaller degree of heat would not dissolve the dressing so soon; and the greater might coagulate and fix, in the body of the linen, those par|ticles which we design to carry off. In a few hours the dressing made use in weaving is dissolved, mixed with the water; and, as it had acquired some degree of acidity, before application, it becomes a species of ferment. Each ferment promotes its own particular species of fermentation, or intestine motion; the putrid ferment sets in motion the putre|factive fermentation: the vinous ferment gives
<PB N="80" REF="015597_0104_0F998DB2E7058468">
rise to the vinous fermentation; and the acid ferment to the acetuous fermentation. That there is a real fermentation going on in steeping, one must be soon convinced, who attends to the air-bubles which immediately begin to arise, to the scum which gathers on the surface, and to the intestine motion and swelling of the whole liquor. That it must be the acetous fermentation, appears from this, that the vegetable particles, al|ready in part soured, must first undergo this process.</P>
<P>The effect of all fermentations is to set the liquor in motion; to raise in it a degree of heat; and to emit air-bubbles, which, by carrying up some of the light oleaginous particles along with them, produce a scum. But as the dressing is in small quantity in pro|portion to the water, these effects are gentle and slow. The acid salts are no sooner sepa|rated, by the acetous fermentation, from the absorbent earth, which made them not perceptible to the tongue in their former state, than they are united to the oily parti|cles of the tallow, which likewise adhere su|perficially, dissolve them, and render them, in some degree, missible with water. In this state they are soon washed off by the intestine motion of the liquor. The consequence of this operation is, that the cloth comes out f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed in a great measure from its superficial dirt; and more pliant and soft than what it was.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="015597_0105_0F998DB39AC04FF8">Whenever this intestine motion is pretty much abated, and before the scum subsides, bleachers take out their cloth. The scum&punc; when no more air-bubbles rise to support it, separates, and falls down; and would again communicate to the cloth great part of the filth. But a longer stay would be attended with a much greater disadvantage. The putrid follows close upon the acetous fermen|tation: When the latter ends, the former be|gins. Were this to take place, in any con|siderable degree, it would render the cloth black and tender. Bleachers cannot be too careful in this article.</P>
<P>The first question that arises to be deter|mined on these principles is, What is the properest liquor for steeping cloth? Those used by bleachers are plain water; white-linen lye and water, equal parts; and rye-meal or bran, mixed with water. They al|ways make use of lye when they have it.</P>
<P>After steeping, the cloth is carried to the putstock-mill, to be freed of all its loose foulness. There can be nothing contrived so effectual to answer the purpose as this mill. Its motion is easy, regular, and safe. While it presses gently, it turns the cloth; which is continually washed with a stream of water. Care must be taken that no water be detained in the folds of the linen, other|wise that part may be damaged.</P>

<HEAD>BUCKING AND BOILING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the most important operation of the whole process, and deserves a thorough examination. Its design is to loosen, and carry off, by the help of alkaline lixives or lyes, that particular substance in cloth, which is the cause of its brown colour.</P>
<P>All ashes used in lye, the pearl excepted, ought to be well pounded, before they are put into the copper; for the Marcoft and Cashub are very hard, and with some diffi|culty yield their salts. As these two last contain a very considerable proportion of a real sulphureous matter, which must in some degree tinge white cloth; and as this is dis|solved much more by boiling, than by the inferior degrees of heat, while the salts may be as well extracted by the latter. The wa|ter should never be brought to boil, and should be continued for some time longer under that degree of heat. The pearl-ashes should never be put in till near the end, as they are easily dissolved in water.</P>
<P>If the salts were always of an equal strength, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e same quantities would make a lye equally strong; but they are not. Salts of the same name differ very much from one another. The Muscovy ashes are turning weaker every day, as every bleacher must have observed, till at last they turn quite effete. A decoction
<PB N="83" REF="015597_0107_0F998DB51E6163B8">
from them when new must differ very much from one when they have been long kept. Hence a necessity of some exact criterion to discover when lyes are of an equal strength. The taste cannot serve, as that is so variable, cannot be described to another, and is blunted by repeated trials. The proof-ball will serve the purpose of the bleachfield suf|ficiently; and, by discovering the specific gravity, will show the quantity of alkaline salts dissolved. But it cannot show the dan|gerous qualities of these salts; for the less caustic and less heavy this liquor is, the more dangerous and corrosive it may be for the cloth.</P>
<P>The third lye, which they draw from these materials by an infusion of cold wa|ter, in which the taste of lime is discover|able, appears plainly to be more dangerous than the first. The second lye, which they extract from the same ashes, and which is reckoned about a third in strength, when compared to the first, must be of the same nature; nor should it be used without an addition of pearl-ashes, which will correct it.</P>
<P>It is taken from a general rule, That the solution of any body in its menstruum is equally diffused through the whole liquor. The bleachers depending on this, use equal quantities of the top and bottom of their lye, when once clear and settled; taking it for granted, that there is an equal quantity of
<PB N="84" REF="015597_0108_0F998DB5F999FCA8">
salts in equal quantities of the lye. But if there is not, the mistake may be of fatal consequence, as the lye may be in some places stronger than what the cloth can with safety bear. That general law of solution must have taken its rise from particular ex|periments, and not from reasoning. Whe|ther a sufficient number of experiments have been tried to ascertain this point, and to establish an undoubted general rule, may be called in question.</P>
<P>"But, says Dr Home, when I had dis|covered that lime makes part of the dissolved substance, and reflected how long its grosser parts will continue suspended in water, there appeared stronger reasons for suspecting that this rule, though it may be pretty general, does not take place here; at least it is worth the pursuit of experiment.</P>
<P>"I weighed at the bleachfield a piece of glass in some cold lye, after it had been boiled, stood for two days, and about the fourth part of it had been used. The glass weighed three drams, one and a half grains in the lye, and three drachms, seven and a half grains in river water. The same glass weighed in the same lye, when almost all used, two grains less than it had done be|fore. This shows, that the last of the lye contained a third more of the dissolved body; and, consequently, was a third stronger than the first of the lye.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="015597_0109_0F998DB9287D2490">"As this might, perhaps, be owing to a continuation of the solution of the salts, I repeated the experiment in a different way.</P>
<P>"I took from the surface some of the lye, after the salts were dissolved, and the liquor was become clear. At the same time I im|mersed a bottle, fixed to a long stick, so near the bottom, as not to raise the ashes there, and&punc; by pulling out the cork by a string, filled the bottle full of the lye near the bottom. The glass weighed in river water three drachms, thirty eight and a half grains; in the lye taken from the surface, three drachms, thirty four and a half grains; and the lye taken from the bottom, three drachms, thirty one and a half grains. This experiment shows, that the lye at the bot|tom was, in this case, three fourths stronger then the lye at the surface.</P>
<P>"At other times when I tried the same experiment, I found no difference in the spe|cific gravity; and therefore, I leave it as a question yet doubtful, though deserving to be ascertained by those who have an opportunity of doing it. As the lye stands continually on the ashes, there can be no doubt but what is used last must be stronger than the first. I would therefore, recommend, to general practice, the method used by Mr John Christie, who draws off the lye, after it has settled, into a second receptacle, and leaves the ashes behind. By this means it never
<PB N="86" REF="015597_0110_0F998DBA47AB2A50">
can turn stronger; and he has it in his power to mix the top and bottom, which cannot be done so long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it stand on the ashes."</P>
<P>Having considered the lye, let us next in|quire how it acts. On this enquiry depends almost the whole theory of bleaching, as its action on cloth is, at least in this country, absolutely necessary. It is found by experi|ment, that one effect they have on cloth, is, the diminishing of its weight; and that their whitening power is, generally, in proportion to their weakening power. Hence arises a probability' that these lyes act by removing somewhat from the cloth, and that the loss of this substance is the cause of whiteness. This appears yet plainer, when the bucking, which lasts from Saturday night to Monday morning is attended to.</P>
<P>There are various and different opinions with regard to the operation of these salts: That they act by altering the external tex|ture of the cloth, or by separating the muci|laginous parts from the rest, or by extracting the oil which is laid up in the cells of the plant. The last is the general opinion, or rather conjecture, for none of them deserves any better name; but may we venture to affirm, that it is so without any better title to pre-eminence, than what the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs have. Alkaline salts dissolve oils, therefore these salts dissolve the cellular oil of the
<PB N="105" REF="015597_0111_0F998DBBA599DAC0">
cloth, is all the foundation which this theory has to rest on; too slight, when unsupported by experiment, to be relied on.</P>
<P>Dr Home endeavours to settle this question by the following experiments and observa|tions.</P>
<P>"Wax, says he, is whitened by being ex|posed to the influence of the sun, air, and moisture. A discovery of the changes made on it by bleaching, may throw a light upon the question.</P>
<P>"Six drachms of wax were sliced down, exposed on a south window, Sept. 10. and watered. That day being clear and warm, bleached the wax more than all the following. It seemed to me to whiten quicker when it had no water thrown on it, than when it had. Sept. 15. it was very white, and one drachm three grains lighter. Three and a half drachms of this bleached wax, and as much of unbleached, taken from the same piece, were made into two candles of the same length and thickness, having cotton wicks of the same kind. The bleached candle burned one hour thirty three minutes; the unbleached three minutes longer. The former run down four times, the latter never. The former had an obscure light and dull flame; the latter had a clear pleasant one, of a blue colour at the bottom. The former when burning seemed to have its wick thick|er, and its flame nearer the wax than the
<PB N="106" REF="015597_0112_0F998DBCC7FA1958">
latter. The former was brittle, the latter not It plainly appears from these facts, that the unbleached wax was more inflammable than the bleached; and that the latter had lost so much of an inflammable substance as it had lost in weight; and consequently the substance lost in bleaching of wax is the oily part.</P>
<P>"As I had not an opportunity of repeat|ing the former experiment, I do not look on it as entirely conclusive; for it is possible that some of the dust, flying about in the air, might have mixed with the bleached wax, and so have rendered it less inflammable. Nor do I think the analogical reasoning from wax to linen without objections. Let us try then if we cannot procure the substance extracted from the cloth, show it to the eye, and examine its different properties. The proper place to find it, is in a lye already used, and fully impregnated with these co|louring particles.</P>
<P>"I got in the bleachfield some lye, which had been used all that day for boiling coarse linen, which was tolerably white, and had been twice boiled before. There could be no dressing remaining in these webs. No soap had ever touched that parcel; nor do they mix soap with the lye used for coarse cloth. Some of this impregnated lye was evaporated, and left a dark-coloured matter behind. This substance felt oily betwixt
<PB N="107" REF="015597_0113_0F998DBD5D5EBCE0">
the fingers, but would not lather in water as soap does. It deflagrated with nitre in fu|sion, and afforded a tincture to spirit of wine. By this experiment the salts seem to have an oily inflammable substance joined with them.</P>
<P>"Could we separate this colouring sub|stance from these salts, and exhibit it by itself, so that it might become the object of experi|ment, the question would be soon decided. Here chymistry lends us its assistance. What|ever has a stronger affinity or attraction to the salts with which it is joined, than this substance has, must set it at liberty, and make it visible. Acids attract alkaline salt from all other bodies; and therefore will serve our purpose.</P>
<P>"Into a quantity of the impregnated lye mentioned in the former experiment, I pour|ed in oil of vitriol. Some bubbles of air arose, an intestine motion was to be perceiv|ed, and the liquor changed its colour from a dark to a turbid white. It curdled like a so|lution of soap, and a scum soon gathered on the surface, about half an inch in thickness, the deepness of the liquor not being above six inches. What was below was now pretty clear. A great deal of the same matter lay in the bottom; and I observed, that the sub|stance on the surface was precipitated, and showed itself heavier than water, when the particles of air, attached to it in great plenty,
<PB N="108" REF="015597_0114_0F998DBE1D7FD588">
were dispelled by heat, This substance was in colour darker than the cloth which had been boiled in it.</P>
<P>"I procured a considerable quantity of it by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imming it off. When I tried to mix it with water, it always fell to the bottom. When dried by the air, it diminished very much in its size, and turned as black as a coal. In this state it deflagrated strongly with nitre in fusion; gave a strong tincture to spirit of wine; and when put on a red hot iron, burnt very slowly, as if it contained a heavy ponderous oil; and left some earth behind.</P>
<P>"From the inflammability of this sub|stance, its rejecting of water, and dissolving in spirit of wine, we discover its oleaginous nature; but from its great specific gravity we see that it differs very much from the expressed or cellular oil of vegetables; and yet more from their mucilage. That it dis|solves in spirit of wine, is not a certain argu|ment of its differing from expressed oils; because these, when joined to alkaline salts, and recovered again by acids; become solu|ble in spirit of wine. The quantity of earthy powder left behind after burning, shows that it contains many of the solid particles of the flax. The substance extracted from cloth by alkaline lyes appears then to be a composition of a heavy oil, and the solid earthy particles of the flax.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="015597_0115_0F998DBF07EC07C8">
"In what manner these salts act so as to dissolve the oils, and detach the solid parti|cles, is uncertain; but we see evidently how much cloth must be weakened by an impro|per use of them, as we find the solid parti|cles themselves are separated."</P>
<P>It is necessary that cloth should be dry be|fore bucking, that the salts may enter into the body of the cloth along with the water; for they will not enter in such quantity, if it be wet; and by acting too powerfully on the external threads, may endanger them.</P>
<P>The degree of heat is a very material cir|cumstance in this operation. As the action of the salts is always in proportion to the heat, it would appear more proper to begin with a boiling heat, by which a great deal of time and labour might be saved. The rea|son why this method is not followed, appears to be this. If any vegetable, or vegetable substance is to be softened, and to have its juices extracted, it is found more proper to give it gentle degrees of heat at first, and to advance gradually, than to plunge it all at once in boiling water. This last degree of heat is so strong, that when applied at once to a vegetable, it hardens, instead of softening its texture. Dried vegetables are immediately put into boiling water by cooks, that these substances may preserve their green colour, which is only to be done by hinder|ing them from turning too soft. Boiling water has the same effect on animal sub|stances;
<PB N="110" REF="015597_0116_0F998DBFAA12D408">
for if salt beef is put into it, the water is kept from getting at the salts, from the outside of the beef being hardened.</P>
<P>But when we consider, how much of an oily substance there is in the cloth, especially at first, which will for some time keep off the water, and how the twisting of the threads, and closeness of the texture, hin|ders the water from penetrating, we shall find, that if boiling water were put on it at once, the cloth might be liable, in several parts, to a dry heat, which would be much worse than a wet one. That the lyes have not access to all parts of the cloth, at first, appears plainly from this, that when it has lain, after the first bucking, till all the lyes are washed out, it is as black, in some parts as when it was steeped. This must be owing to the discharge of the colouring par|ticles from those places to which the lye has access, and to their remaining where it has not.</P>
<P>It would seem adviseable, then, in the first bucking or two, when the cloth is foul, to use the lye considerably below the boiling point; that by this soaking or maceration, the foulness may be entirely discharged, and the cloth quite opened for the speedy recep|tion of the boiling lye in the buckings which follow.</P>
<P>The lyes should likewise be weakest in the first buckings, because then they act only
<PB N="111" REF="015597_0117_0F998DC067EF5BB0">
on the more external parts; whereas, when the cloth is more opened, and the field of action is increased, the active powers ought to be so too. For this reason they are at the strongest after some sourings.</P>
<P>The only thing that now remains to be considered, is, the management of the coarse cloth, where boiling is substituted in place of bucking. This species of linen cannot af|ford the time and labour necessary for the latter operation; and therefore they must undergo a shorter, and more active method. As the heat continues longer at the degree of boiling, the lyes used to the coarse cloth must be weaker than those used to the fine. There is not so much danger from heat in the coarse as in the fine cloth, because the former is of a more open texture, and will allow the lye to penetrate more speedily. In the closer kinds, however, the first applica|tion of the salts should be made without a boiling heat.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ALTERNATE WATERING and DRYING.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the cloth has been bucked, it is carried out to the field, and frequently watered for the first six hours. For if dur|ing that time, when it is strongly impreg|nated with salts, it is allowed to dry, the salts approaching closer together, and, assisted
<PB N="112" REF="015597_0118_0F998DC11DFF69B0">
by a greater degree of heat, increasing always in proportion to the dryness of the cloth, act with greater force, and destroy its very texture.</P>
<P>After this time, dry spots are allowed to appear before it gets any water. In this state it profits most, as the latter part of the evaporation comes from the more internal parts of the cloth, and will carry away most from those parts. The bleaching of the wax, in a preceding experiment, helps to confirm this: for it seemed to whiten most when the last particles of water were going off.</P>
<P>This continual evaporation from the sur|face of the cloth shows, that the design of the operation is to carry off somewhat re|maining after the former process of bucking. This appears likewise from a fact known to all bleachers, that the upper-side of cloth, where the evaporation is strongest, attains to a greater degree of whiteness than the under-side. But it is placed beyond all doubt by experiment, which shews, that cloth turns much lighter by being exposed to the influence of the sun, air, and winds, even though the salts have been washed out of it.</P>
<P>What, then, is this substance? As we have discovered in the former section, that the whitening, in the operation of bucking, depends on the extracting or loosening the
<PB N="113" REF="015597_0119_0F998DC274BA5638">
heavy oil, and solid particles of the flax; it appears highly probable, that the effects of watering, and exposition to the sun, air, and winds, are produced by the evaporation of the same substance, joined to the salts, with which composite body the cloth is impreg|nated when exposed on the field. That these salts are in a great measure carried off or destroyed, appears from the cloth's being allowed to dry without any danger, after the evaporation has gone on for some time. "If we can show says Dr. Home, that oils and salts, when joined together, are capable of being exhaled, in this manner, by the heat of the atmosphere, we shall reduce this ques|tion to a very great degree of certainty.</P>
<P>"Sept. 10. I exposed, in a south-west window, half an oz. of Castile soap, sliced down and watered. Sept. 14. when well dried, it weighed but 3 dr. 6 gr. Sept. 22. it weighed 2 dr. 2 gr. Sept. 24. it weighed 1 dr. 50 gr. It then seemed a very little whiter; but was much more mucilaginous in its taste, and had no degree of saltness, which it had before.</P>
<P>"It appears from this experiment, that soap is so v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">latile, when watered and exposed to air not very warm, that it loses above half its weight in fourteen days. The same must happen to the saponaceous substance, form|ed from the conjunction of the alkaline salts, heavy oil, and earthy particles of the flax.
<PB N="114" REF="015597_0120_0F998DC30A0F8020">
The whole design, then, of this operation, which, by way of pre-eminence, gets the name of <HI>bleaching,</HI> is to carry off, by the evaporation of water, whatever has been loosened by the former process of bucking.</P>
<P>"Against this doctrine there may be brought two objections, seemingly of great weight. It is a general opinion among bleachers, that linen whitens quicker in March and April, than in any other months: But as the evaporation cannot be so great at that time, as when the sun has a greater heat; hence the whitening of cloth is not in pro|portion to the degree of evaporation; and therefore the former cannot be owing to the latter. This objection vanishes, when we consider, that the cloth which comes first in|to the bleachfield, in the spring, is closely attended, having no other to interfere with it for some time; and, as it is the whitest, gets, in the after buckings, the first of the lye; while the second parcel is often bucked with what has been used to the first. Were the fact true, on which the objection is founded, this would be a sufficient answer to the objection. But it appears not to be true, from an observation of Mr. John Chris|tie, That cloth laid down in the beginning of June, and finished in September, takes generally less work, and undergoes fewer operations, than what is laid down in March, and finished in June.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="015597_0121_0F998DC422C55E00">"The other objection is, That cloth dries much faster in windy weather than in calm sunshine; but it does not bleach so fast. This would seem to show, that the sun has some particular influence independent on eva|poration. In answer to this objection, let it be considered, that it is not the evaporation from the surface, but from the more internal parts that is of benefit to the cloth. Now, this latter evaporation must be much stronger in sunshine than in windy weather, on ac|count of the heat of the sun, which will make the cloth more open; while the cold|ness of windy weather must shut it up, so that the evaporation will all be from the sur|face. Clear sunshine, with a very little wind, is observed to be the best weather for bleach|ing; a convincing proof that this reasoning is just.</P>
<P>"It would seem to follow as a corollary from this reasoning, that the number of wa|terings should in general be in proportion to the strength of the lye; for the stronger the lye is, the more there is to be evaporated; and the greater the danger, in case the cloth should be allowed to dry. But there is an exception to this general rule, arising from the consideration of another circumstance. It is observed, that cloth, when brown dries sooner than when it becomes whiter, arising from the closeness and oiliness which it then has, not allowing the water a free passage.

Perhaps that colour may retain a greater de|gree of heat, and in that way assist a very little. Cloth therefore, after the first buck|ings, must be more carefully watered than after the last.</P>
<P>"It follows likewise from this reasoning, that the soil of the bleachfield should be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|velly or sandy, that the water may pass quickly through it, and that the heat may be increased by the reflection of the soil: for the success of this operation depends on the mu|tual action of heat and evaporation. It is likewise necessary that the water should be light, soft, and free from mud or dirt, which, not being able to rise along with the water, must remain behind. When there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much of this, it becomes necessary to rins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the cloth in water, and then give it a mill|ing, to take out the dirt; else it would be fixed in the cloth by the following buckings, as it is not soluble by the lye.</P>
<P>"This operation has more attributed to it by bleachers than it can justly claim. The cloth appears even to the eye, to whiten un|der these alternate waterings and dryings; and these naturally get the honour of it, when it more properly belongs to the former operati|on. Here lies the fallacy. Alkaline salts give a very high colour to the decoctions, or infusion of vegetables. This is probably ow|ing to the solution of the oleaginous colour|ing particles of the plant; which particles
<PB N="117" REF="015597_0123_0F998DC750BF9518">
being opened and separated by the salts, oc|cupy a greater space, and give a deep co|lour to the liquor. The cloth participates of the liquor and colour. Hence bleachers al|ways judge of the goodness of the bucking by the deepness of its colour. The rule, in general, is good. I observe, that in those buckings which continue from Saturday night to Monday morning, the cloth has al|ways the deepest colour. When that cloth has been exposed some hours to the influence of the air, these colouring particles, which are but loosely attached to it, are evaporated, and the linen appears of a brighter colour. This operation does no more than complete what the former had almost finished. If its own merit were thoroughly known, there would be no occasion to attribute that of another operation to it. Thread, and open cloths, such as diaper, may be reduced to a great degree of whiteness, after one bucking, by it alone. No cloth, as would appear, can attain to a bright whiteness without it.</P>
<P>"Since the only advantage of watering is the removal of the salts, and what they have dissolved, might we not effectuate this by some cheaper, and more certain method? For it occupies many hands; and must de|pend altogether on the uncertainty of the weather; so that, in the beginning of the season, the bleacher is often obliged to re|peat his buckings without bleaching. We
<PB N="118" REF="015597_0124_0F998DC8C0503340">
might take out the alkaline salts by acids; but then the other substance would be left alone in the cloth, nor would any washing be able to remove it. Mill-washing appears a more probable method of taking out both salts and oils; and it would seem that this might, in a great measure, supply the place of watering; but upon trial it does not suc|ceed. Two parcels of linen were managed equally in every other respect, except in this, that one was watered, and exposed to the in|fluence of the air, and the other was only mill-washed. This method was followed until they were fit for souring. The cloth which had been mill-washed, had a remark|able green colour, and did not recover the bright colour of the pieces managed in the common way, until it had been treated like them for a fortnight. The green colour was certainly owing to a precipitation of the sul|phureous particles, with which the lye is im|pregnated, upon the surface of the cloth; owing to the salts being washed off more speedily than the sulphur, to which they are united in the lye. The attachment betwixt these two bodies we know is very loose, and the separation easily made. Evaporation then a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one is sufficient to carry off these sul|phureous particles."</P>

<P>IT is well known to all chymists, that alkaline salts are convertible, by different methods, into absorbent earths&punc; frequent solution in water, and evaporation of it again, is one of these. This transmutation then of these salts, which are not volatilised or wash|ed away, must be continually going on in the cloth under these alternate w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">terings and dryings of the former process; not much in|deed after the first two or three buckings; because the salts, not having entered deep in|to the cloth, are easily washed off, or eva|porated. But when they penetrate into the very composition of the last and minutest fi|bres, of which the first vessels are made, they find greater difficulty of escaping again, and must be more subject to this transmutation. But if we consider the bleaching ashes as a composition of lime and alkaline salts, we must discover a fresh fund for the deposition of this absorbent earth. The common caus|tic, a composition of this very kind, soon converts itself, if exposed to the open air, in|to a harmless earthy powder.</P>
<P>Frequent buckings and bleachings load the cloth with this substance. It becomes then necessary to take it out. No washing can do that, because earth is not soluble in water, Nothing but acids can remove it. These are attracted by the absorbent earth, join
<PB N="120" REF="015597_0126_0F998DCA854C0C70">
themselves to it, and compose a kind of neu|tral imperfect salt, which is soluble in water; and therefore easily washed out of the cloth. The acid liquors commonly used are butter-milk, which is reckoned the best, sour milk, infusions of bran, rye-meal, &amp;c. kept for some days till they sour. Sour whey is thought to give the cloth a yellow colour.</P>
<P>The linen ought to be dried before it is put in the sour, that the acid particles may pene|trate, along with the watery, through the whole. A few hours after it has been there, air bubbles arise, the liquor swells, and a thick scum is formed; manifest signs of a fermen|tation. The following experiment, says Dr. Home, shews the degree of heat which at|tends it.</P>
<P>"May 25. I put a thermometer of Fah|renheit's into some butter-milk, of which the bleachers were composing their sours, and which stood in a vat adjoining to another, where the milk was the same, and the sour|ing process had been going on for two days. After the thermometer had been twenty minutes in the butter-milk, the mercury stood at 64 degrees. In the souring vat it rose to 68 degrees. An increase of 4 degrees shows a pretty brisk intestine motion.</P>
<P>"To what are all these effects owing? To the acetous fermentation going on in those vegetable liquors, whose acids, extri|cating themselves, produce heat, intestine
<PB N="121" REF="015597_0127_0F998DCB33467318">
motion, and air-bubbles. As the change is slow, the process takes five or six days be|fore it is finished. During this time the acid particles are continually uniting themselves to the absorbent earth in the cloth. That this fermentation goes on in the liquor alone, ap|pears from this consideration, that the same effects, viz. air-bubbles and scum are to be seen in the butter-milk alone. The only effect then it has is, by the small degree of heat, and intestine motion which attend it, to assist the junction of the acid and absorbent particles. We shall presently see, that this process may be carried on, to as great advant|age, without any fermentation; and there|fore it appears not absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>"When these absorbent particles are fully saturated, the remaining acids may unite with, and have some small effect in extracting the colouring particles. This appears from the two following experiments.</P>
<P>"Sept. 20. A piece of cloth which had been steeped, weighing forty one grains and a half, was put into a half-pound of butter milk, whigged, and well soured, by a mix|ture of water, and by boiling. Sept. 24. When taken out, and washed in water, it ap|peared a very little whiter. The mineral acids, as will appear afterwards, whiten cloth, even though they are very much diluted.</P>
<P>"Just before the acetous fermentation is finished, the cloth should be taken out;
<PB N="122" REF="015597_0128_0F998DCBA227D1F8">
otherwise the scum will fall down, and lodge in the cloth, and the putrefaction which then begins will weaken it. This appears from the following experiment.</P>
<P>"Sept. 16. A piece of cloth, weighing forty two grains, was laid in butter-milk un|whigged. Nov. 15. The milk had a putri|fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d smell. The cloth was a little whiter, but very tender; and weighed&punc; when well washed in warm water and dried, forty grains."</P>
<P>All the sours made of bran, rye-meal, &amp;c. ought to be prepared before use; for by this means so much time will be saved. Besides, when the water is poured upon the cloth, and bran, as is done in the management of coarse cloth, the linen is not in a better situ|ation than if it had been taken up wet from the field; and by this means the acid parti|cles cannot penetrate so deep. Again, this method of mixing the bran with the cloth, may be attended with yet worse consequences. All vegetable substances, when much pressed, fall into the putrescent, and not the acetous fermentation. This often happens to the bran pressed betwixt the different layers on the linen, which must weaken the cloth. Hence, all sours should be prepared before the cloth is steeped in them; and none of the bran or meal should be mixed with the cloth.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="015597_0129_0F998DCC5F43C8C0">The sours are used strongest at first, and gradually weakened till the cloth has attain|ed to its whiteness. In the first sourings, there is more of the earthy matter in the cloth, from the many buckings it has under|gone, than what there can be afterwards. As the quantity of this matter decreases, so should the strength of the sour. There is not, however, the least danger, at any time, from too strong a sour.</P>
<P>What is most wanted in this operation is a more expeditious and cheaper method of ob|taining the same end. As it takes five or six days, it retards the whitening of the cloth considerably; and as bleachers are obliged to send for milk to a great distance, it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes very dear. This last consideration makes them keep it so long, that, when used, it can have no good effect; perhaps it may have a bad one.</P>
<P>There is one consideration that may lead us to shorten the time. It is observed that the souring process is sooner finished in warm than in cold weather. Heat quickens the fermentation, by aiding the intestine motion. The va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s therefore should not be buried in the ground, as they always are, which must keep them cold; there should rather be pipes along the walls of the room, to give it that degree of heat, which, on trial, may be found to answer best, There are few days in summer so hot as is necessary; and the
<PB N="124" REF="015597_0130_0F998DCD2C904788">
beginning and end of the season is by much too cold. That this is no ideal scheme, the following fact is a sufficient proof. There are two vats in Salton bleachfield, adjoining to a partition-wall, at the back of which there is a kitchen fire. In these vats the souring process is finished in three days, whereas its lasts five or six days in the others placed round the same room.</P>
<P>This improvement, though it shortens the time of souring a very little, yet is no reme|dy against the scarcity and dearness of milk sours. Such a liquor as would serve our purpose, must be found either among the vegetable acids, which have no further fer|mentation to undergo, or among the mine|ral acids. The former are a large class, and contain within themselves many different species; such as the acid juice of several plants, vinegars made of fermented liquors, and acid salts, called tartars. But there is one objection against these vegetable acids: They all contain, along with the acid, a great quantity of oily particles, which would not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to discolour the cloth. Besides the de|mand of the bleachfields would raise their price too high.</P>
<P>The mineral acids have neither of these objections, they are exceedingly cheap, and contain no oil.
"I will freely own, says Dr. Home, that at first I had no great opini|on of success from the mineral, from two
<PB N="125" REF="015597_0131_0F998DCDE2B1F928">
reasons; their want of all fermentation, which I then looked on as necessary; and their ex|treme corrosiveness. But the experience of two different summers, in two different bleach|fields, has convinced me, that they will an|swer all the purposes of the milk and bran sours; nay, in several respects, be much pre|ferable to them. I have seen many pieces of fine cloth, which had no other sours but those of vitriol; and were as white and strong as those bleached in the common way. I have cut several webs through the mid|dle, and bleached one half with milk, and the other with vitriol; gave both the same number of operations, and the latter were as white and strong as the former."</P>
<P>The method in which it has been hitherto used is this. The proportion of the oil of vitriol to the water, with which it is diluted, is half an ounce, or at most three quarters, to a gallon of water. As the milk-sours are di|minished in strength, so ought the vitriol-sours. The whole quantity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of vi|triol to be used, may be first mixed with a small quantity of water, then added to the whole quantity of water, and well mixed to|gether. The water should be milk-warm; by which means the acid particles will pene|trate further, and operate sooner. The cloth should then be put dry into the liquor.</P>
<P>It is observed that this sour performs its task much sooner than those of milk and
<PB N="126" REF="015597_0132_0F998DCEE45C9FD0">
bran; so that Mr. John Christie, in making the trial, used to lay the milk-sours twenty four hours before the vitriol. Five hours will do as much with this sour, as five days with the common sort. But the cloth can receive no harm in allowing it to remain for some days in the sour; but rather, on the contra|ry, an advantage. The cloth is then taken out, well rinsed, and mill-washed in the or|dinary way.</P>
<P>The liquor, while the cloth lies in this s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, is less acid the second day than the first, less the third than the second, and so dimi|nishes by degrees. At first it is clear, but by degrees a mucilaginous substance is ob|served to float in it, when put into a glass. This foulness increases every day. This sub|stance, extracted by the acid, is the same with what is extracted by the alkaline salts, and blunts the acidity of the former, as it does the alkalescency of the latter. Hence the liquor loses by degrees its acidity. But as the acid salts do not unite so equally with oily substances as the alkaline do, the liquor is not so uniformly tinged in the former as in the latter case, and the mucous substance presents itself floating in it.</P>
<P>It is observed, that, in the first souring, which is the strongest, the liquor, which was a pretty strong acid before the cloth was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut in, immediately afterwards becomes quite vapid; a proof how very soon it performs its
<PB N="127" REF="015597_0133_0F998DD231C23860">
task. But in the following operations, as the linen advances in whiteness, the acidy conti|nues much longer; so that in the last opera|tions the liquor loses very little of its acidity. This happens although the first buckings, af|ter the first sourings, are increased in strength, while the sours are diminished. There are two causes to which this is owing. The texture of the cloth is now so opened, that although the lyes are strong&punc; the alkaline salts and ab|sorbent earth are easily washed out; and the oily particles are, in a great measure, removed which help to blunt the acidity of the liquor.</P>
<P>Two objections are made against the use of vitriol-sours. One is, that the process of souring with milk is performed by a fermen|tation; and, as there is no fermentation in the vitriol-sours, they cannot serve the pur|pose so well: The other, that they may hurt the texture of the cloth. The answer to the former objection is very short; that the vitriol sours operate successfully without a fermen|tation, as experience shews; and therefore in them a fermentation is not necessary.</P>
<P>As to the latter objection, that oil of vitriol, being a very corrosive body, may hurt the cloth; that will vanish likewise, when it is considered how much the vitriol is diluted with water, that the liquor is not stronger than vinegar, and that it may be safely taken into the human body.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="015597_0134_0F998DD359BD2450">That it may be used with safety, much stronger than what is necessary in the bleach|field, appears from the following experiment with regard to the stamping of linen. After the linen is boiled in a lye of ashes, it is bleached for some time. After this, in or|der to make it receive the colour, it is steep|ed in a sour of water and oil of vitriol, about fifteen times stronger than that made use of in the bleachfield; for, to 100 gallons of water are added two and a half of oil of vi|triol. Into this quantity of liquor, made so warm as the hand can just be held in it, is put seven pieces of 28 yards each. The linen remains in it about two hours, and comes out remarkably whiter. The fine cloth often undergoes this operation twice. Nor is there any danger if the oil of vitriol is well mixed with the water. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if the two are not well mixed together, and the oil of vitriol remains in some parts undiluted, the cloth is corrod|ed into holes.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of the advantages which the vitriol-sours must have over the milk. The latter is full of oily particles, some of which must be left in the cloth: But the case is worse when the scum is al|lowed to precipitate upon the cloth. The former is liable to neither of these objections.</P>
<P>The common sours hasten very fast to cor|ruption; and if, from want of proper care, they ever arrive at that state, must damage
<PB N="129" REF="015597_0135_0F998DD4C2C90EF8">
the cloth very much. As the milk is kept very l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, it is often corrupted before it is used; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d without acting as a sour, has all the bad effects of putrefaction. The vitriol-sours are not subject to putrefaction.</P>
<P>The m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k takes five days to perform its task, but the vitriol-sours do it in as many hours; nay, perhaps as many minutes. Their junction with the absorbent particles in the cloth must be immediate, whenever these acid particles enter with the water. An un|answerable proof that the fact is so, arises from the circumstances which happen when the cloth is first steeped in the vitriol-sour; the cloth has no sooner imbibed the acid li|quor than it looses all acidity, and becomes immediately vapid. This effect of vitriol sours must be of great advantage in the bleach|field, as the bleachers are at present hindred from enjoying the season by the tediousness of the souring process. The whole round of operations takes seven days; to answer which they must have seven parcels, which are oft|en mixing together, and causing mistakes. As three days, at most, will be sufficient for all the operations when vitriol-sours are used, there will be no more than three parcels. The cloth will be kept a shorter time in the bleachfield, and arrive sooner at market.</P>
<P>The milk-sours are very dear, and often difficult to be got; but the vitriol are cheap may be easily procured, and at any time.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="015597_0136_0F998DD55F0D8A08">There is yet another advantage in the use of vitriol, and that is its power of whitening cloth. Even in this diluted state, its white|ning power is very considerable. We have already seen, that it removes the same co|louring particles, which the alkaline lyes do. What of it then remains, after the alkaline and absorbent particles are neutralized in the cloth, must act on these colouring particles, and help to whiten the cloth. That this is really the case, appears from the following fact. Mr. Chrystie being obliged to chuse twenty of the whitest pieces out of a hundred, five of the twenty were taken out of seven pieces which were bleached with vitriol.</P>
<P>From both experience and reason, it ap|pears, that it would be for the advantage of our linen manufacture to use vitriol in place of milk-sours.</P>

<HEAD><HI>HAND RUBBING</HI> with Soap and Warm Wa|ter, <HI>RUBBING-BOARDS, STARCHING</HI> and BLUEING.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the cloth comes from the sour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, it should be well washed in the washing mill, to take off all the acid particles which adhere to its surface. All acids decompose soap, by separating the alkaline salts and oily parts from one another. Were this to happen on the surface of the cloth, the oil would remain; nor would the washing-mill afterwards be able to carry it off.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="015597_0137_0F998DD621147D98">From the washing-mill the fine cloth is carried to be rubbed by womens hands, with soap and water. As the liquors, which are generally employed for souring, are impreg|nated with oily particles, many of these must lodge in the cloth, and remain, notwith|standing the preceding milling. It is proba|ble, that all the heavy oils are not evaporated by bleaching. Hence it becomes necessary to apply soap and warm water, which unite with, dissolve, and carry them off. It is ob|served, that if the cloth, when it is pretty white, gets too much soap, the following bleaching is apt to make it yellow; on that account they often wring out the soap.</P>
<P>It is a matter worth inquiring into, whe|ther hard or soft soap is best for cloth. Most bleachers agree, that hard soap is apt to leave a yellowness in the cloth. It is said, that the use of hard soap is discharged in Holland. As there must be a considerable quantity of sea-salt in this kind, which is not in the soft, and as this salt appears prejudicial to cloth, the soft soap ought to be preferred.</P>
<P>The management of the coarse cloth is ve|ry different, in this operation, from fine. Instead of being rubbed with hands, which would be too expensive, it is laid on a table, run over with soap, and then put betwixt the rubbing-boards, which have ridges and grooves from one side to another, like teeth.
<PB N="132" REF="015597_0138_0F998DD6F2A70A80">
These boards have small ledges to keep in the soap and water, which saves the cloth. They are moved by hands, or a water-wheel, which is more equal and cheaper. The cloth is drawn, by degrees, through the boards, by men who attend; or, which is more equal and cheaper, the same water-wheel moves two rollers, with ridge and groove, so that the former enters the latter, and, by a gentle motion round their own axis, pull the cloth gradually through the boards.</P>
<P>This mill was invented in Ireland, about thirty years ago. The Irish bleachers use it for their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, as well as coarse cloth. These rubbing boards were discharged, some years ago, in Ireland, by the trustees for the ma|nufactures of that country, convinced from long experience of their bad effects. But as proper care was not taken to instruct the bleachers by degrees in a safer method, they continued in the old, made a party, and kept poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the rubbing boards. There were considerable improvements made in them in this country; such as the addition of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dges, to keep the cloth moist; and of the rollers, which pull the cloth more gra|dually than mens hands. These improve|ments were first made in Salton bleachfield.</P>
<P>The obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions against these rubbing-boards, are unanswerable. By rubbing on such an unequal surface, the solid fibrous part of the cloth is wore; by which means it is
<PB N="133" REF="015597_0139_0F998DD7A5F4EB40">
much thinned, and in a great measure weak|ened before it comes to the market. As a proof of this, if the water which comes from the cloth in the rubbing boards be examined, it will be found full of cottony fibrous matter. These boards give the cloth a cottony surface, so that it does not keep long clean. Again, they flatten the threads, and take away all that roundness and firmness, which is the dis|tinguishing property of cloth bleached in the Dutch method.</P>
<P>For these reasons they must be very preju|dicial to fine cloth, and should never be used in bleaching it. As they seem to be, in some measure, necessary to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssen the expence of bleaching course linen, they ought never to be used above twice or thrice at most. They might be rendered much more s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, by lining their insides with some soft elastic substance, that will not wear the cloth so much as the wooden teeth do. Mr. Chrystie at Perth has lined his boards with short hair for some years past, and finds that it answers very well.</P>
<P>After the course linen has undergone a rubbing, it should be immediately milled for an hour, and warm wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er poured now and then on it to make it lather. This milling has very good effects; for it cleans the cloth of all the dirt and filth which the rubbing-boards have loosened, and which, at the next boiling, would discolour the cloth. Be|sides, it is observed, that it makes the cloth
<PB N="134" REF="015597_0140_0F998DD8630EE250">
less cottony, and more firm, than when whi|tened by rubbing alone.</P>
<P>The last operation is that of starching and blueing. It often happens, that the cloth, when exposed to the weather to be dried after this operation, gets rain; which un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oes all again, and forces the bleacher to a new expence.

protracts it: For, instead of loosening the oil and dirt in the cloth, when brown, it rather fixes them; just as when fine cloth is buck|ed with over-warm lyes in the first buckings. Lime is by no means fit for discharging the oil in the cloth, but for cleaning it of the dead part commonly called sprat. The cloth, being cleaned, is laid upon a dreeper. It must not be drier before bucking with lime, otherwise it will take in more than can be got out again before the next application: For as I have observed already, that lime is only fit for discharging the dead part, bucking thus wet make it rest on the outside of the cloth. I take a lippy of the finest and rich|est powdered lime that can be got, of the brightest white colour, as poor lime does more hurt than good, to thirty pieces of the above length; and make a cold lye of it, by stirring and pouring water off the lime, un|til all be dissolved, but the dross, which is thrown away: Then I add a little soap, which makes the lye have the nearest resemb|lance to milk that breaks in boiling, of any thing I can think of: For this soap blunts the hotness of the lime. Then I take the cloth, and dip it in the lime-lye, and that moment out again, and lay it on a dreeper until it be bucked; then put it on the field, watering it carefully; for if allowed to dry, it is much damaged. This is done always in the morn|ing: As it cannot be done at night, in re|gard

of the hot quality of the lime, which soon heats the cloth, and tenders it. If a hot sunshine follows, it has great effect; for lime is just like all other materials for bleaching, that have more or less effect according as the weather is good or bad. I take it up the se|cond day after bucking, and give it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little milling, or hand-bleaching, or bettling, com|monly called knocking; and lay it on the field again, watering it carefully as before. The effect is more visible the second than the first day. As all cloth when limed should have a great deal of work, otherwise more than half the effect is lost; and not only that, but a great deal of labour and pains is requi|site to take the lime out of the cloth again; it must never be exposed on the Sabbath day, but carefully kept wet always while used in in this way. Thus bucking for three or four times at most, is sufficient for any cloth, ex|cept that made of flax pulled either over-green, or which grows in a droughty season, or perhaps not so well heckled as it should be. This sort occasions great trouble and expence to the bleacher. But the most ef|fectual and expeditious way I ever found for this kind, was, after boiling, to take a little of the warm lye, and mix a very small quan|tity of lime with it, and draw the cloth through that as hot as possible, and put it on the field directly, watering it carefully. This will clean it of the sprat surprisingly. Then
<PB N="138" REF="015597_0144_0F998DDC18CBFDF0">
I boil it with pearl ashes, and give it the last boil with soap.</P>
<P>"There are innumerable mistakes in the use of lime committed by the vulgar, who are ignorant of its quality and effects. They know only this in general, that it is a thing which whitens cloth cheap, and is easy pur|chased; therefore they will use it. Some of them begin whitening of their cloth with it, which I have already observed to be wrong, and given reasons for it, and continue it until the cloth is bleached; give it a boil or two at most, and then wash it up while the gross body of the lime is in the substance of the cloth. This makes limed cloth easily distin|guishable from unlimed, as the former has a yellowish colour, and is full of a powder. Besides, as lime is of a very hot corroding na|ture, it must by degrees weaken the cloth. The bad effects of this substance do not end here. When the cloth is put on board, it con|tracts a dampness, which not only makes it yellow, and lose any thing of colour it has, but directly rots it. And although it should escape this, which it is possible it may, by a quick and speedy passage; yet whenever it is put in any warehouse, it will meet with mois|ture there especially if the winter-season should come on before it is disposed or made use of. These I take to be the principal rea|sons for so much complaint in bleaching with this material."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="015597_0145_0F998DDC28EB8E30">The whole art and safety in using the lime, according to this method, depends on the junction of the alkaline salts, during the bucking, to the particles of lime which were on the surface of the cloth.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>NETTLE THREAD</HI> invented at <HI>LEIPSIC.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH we are told, in some books upon plants, that thread may be made of nettles, as of hemp or flax, the hint is so simply and superficially conveyed, that every person who reads it, will consider the scheme as one of those vain speculations which ne|ver can be reduced to practice, with any ap|pearance of advantage, Is it not, therefore, without reason, that we flatter ourselves with the hope of interesting the attention of the public, when we give it to understand, that a weaver of stuffs, silks and velvet, at Leipsic, had made the first successful experiment up|on nettles.</P>
<P>This plant is divided into three kinds, the great, stinging, common nettle, <HI>Urtica urens maxima,</HI> the little Greek nettle, <HI>Urtica urens minor,</HI> and the Roman or male nettle, <HI>Urtico Romana.</HI> It is the first of these that is used for this purpose.</P>
<P>The great nettle pushes out stalks to the height of three feet, and sometimes more&punc; square, channelled, round, covered with a
<PB N="140" REF="015597_0146_0F998DDCDDA04250">
stinging hair, branchy, cloathed with leaves, two of which are opposed to each other, be|ing oblong, broad, pointed, indented in their edges, furnished with stinging and burning hairs, attached to pretty long tails. It grows every where in great plenty, especially in uncultivated sandy places, about hedges and ditches, along walls, and even in gardens.</P>
<P>It is distinguished into male and female; and the common people are mistaken in this plant as well as in hemp and flax, calling the female, male, and the male female. But the botanists who conform themselves to nature, without confounding the species of things, call that which bears flowers, the male net|tle, and that which bears seed, the female. The flowers spring at the summit of the stalk and branches, in the hollow between the stem of the leaf and the stalk, disposed in branches, each composed of several stamina, supported by a calix of four green leaves, and leave no seed behind them. The seed is oval, flat and brownish, contained in pointed capsulae. The nettle flourishes in June, and the seed is ripe in July and Au|gust. Its leaves fade at the approach of winter; but its stalk, which resists the ri|gour of that season, pushes out new leaves in the spring. In fine, the colour of the stalk and leaves is not always green, but va|ries, and is called red nettle, yellow nettle, and party-coloured nettle.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="015597_0147_0F998DE024428050">The manufacturer whom we have menti|oned, having read in Robinson, that he had made ropes and even stuff of nettle, was tempted, if possible, to verify the fact; and a great quantity of the stalks still green, though half withered, being gathered, he dried them over his stove, and when the moisture was entirely exhausted, bruised them so as to be able to separate the wood from the bark: by this operation he procured a kind of green hards, which was rubbed and pre|pared like flax. This new matter being spun, he obtained a greenish brown thread, very uniform and clear, something resembling worsted. The manufacturer afterwards boil|ed this thread, when it yielded a greenish juice, and became more white, uniform and strong; so that, by continuing the prepara|tion, it is to be hoped an excellent thread may be made, and consequently a strong and lasting cloth.</P>
<P>We are informed that the experiments are still continued; and that they have all the reason in the world to hope, that by observ|ing the precise time of the nettle's being ripe, by steeping and preparing it exactly in the same manner, with hemp and flax, they will acquire a perfect knowledge of the nature and properties of the thread which is pro|duced, and which may be employed to ad|vantage, not only by rope-makers, but even by weavers, in making fine stuffs.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="015597_0148_0F998DE1F57E36C0">For the inventer being a man in easy cir|cumstances, not at all jealous of the secret, but capable, by his condition, to give weight to his conjectures, believes that nettle may be wrought like cotton, and produce cloth a great deal more strong, soft, warm, white, and of a better pile and more uniform con|sistence: in this case it would be of great ad|vantage to the public, which would be no longer under the necessity of going to buy cotton in foreign countries. But granting that it never can be brought to the perfecti|on of cotton, it might certainly be substituted in its room, upon many occasions, and at least produce a very strong and serviceable thread; as the stalks are long, and the fi|bres, in like manner, long, clear and firm. This consideration alone is sufficient to prompt mankind to renew the experiment, advance the discovery, and even bring it to perfection. The essay which we have com|municated, ought to be considered as the first moment after the birth of an art which wants nothing but the industry of man for its growth and formation. The Prussian blue, which now produces a considerable traffic, had not such favourable beginnings; for eve|ry thing is favourable on the side of nettles, which rise every where, the worst ground being good enough for their production: with a little cultivation, they might be pro|cured in vast abundance; and these advant|ages

<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> upon the <HI>MANAGEMENT</HI> of <HI>CATTLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE do not pretend, in this article, to give a detail of the method of managing cat|tle: we propose only to make some remarks upon points which we have observed too commonly neglected. For this purpose we cannot dispense with censuring a general fault of all those whose fortunes are under a mediocrity; for people of these circumstances, finding it impracticable to make large profits, reject disdainfully the small advantages conti|nually in their power; mistaking the cha|grin of envy, and the languor of indolence for marks of the elevation of their spirit, and of the nobleness of their sentiments. In vain, the wise man informs them, that whoever neglects small profits will decay day by day: in vain reason dictates, that from a small stock they must be contented with small gain; but that a great number of small profits, which it is easy to multiply by labour, be|come in a short time an object of considerati|on. Although experience confirms these truths daily, by the decay or prosperity of some one of their neighbours; they shut their eyes to the true causes of these events, and
<PB N="144" REF="015597_0150_0F998DE302B55818">
impute them to those that are suggested by malice and indolence.</P>
<P>From the care of cattle result the most speedy, the most abundant and most lawful advantages. There are but too many avari|cious monopolists in the country, who hoard|ing up the corn they cannot use, with a view to profit by some future bad crop, pave the way for a general scarcity, which, whenever it afflicts the nation, they endeavour to pro|long. But this wickedness cannot be practised with cattle. Whoever shall persist in keep|ing more of them than he can maintain, would expose himself to inevitable ruin, by starving his cattle, and he would be very soon obliged to get rid of them. There can be no objection against him whose stock is in proportion to his pasture: he contributes to|wards the public good, by multiplying the species, by procuring plentiful crops, with the manure he provides for the ground, and by lowering as much as lies in his power, the price of the most necessary commodities, by the abundance he brings to market.</P>
<P>We must not however imagine, that in order to derive a considerable advantage from cattle, it suffices to have a great number, and to give them the necessary fodder: there are many other circumstances to be attended to, without which it would be in vain to flatter ourselves with the expectation of riches. In limiting the subject to horned cattle, we shall
<PB N="145" REF="015597_0151_0F998DE39FDAA1F0">
observe, that they are often kept in too nar|row stables, from whence many inconveni|encies arise. Sometimes being provoked, they fight and wound one an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther. The most voracious st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve their neighbours, from whom they carry off all the fodder within their reach; and the injured cows decay in|sensibly, become languid, or give little milk. In the summer the heat incommodes them, a circumstance which makes them grow lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and diminishes the quantity of their milk. Care, then, must be taken, that they have room in their stable, that they be cool in summer, and warm in winter. At all sea|sons let them be dry, for that is a material point. Even in summer, humidity is disa|greeable to them, and in winter it chills them. To prevent this double inconvenience, it is proper to pave the stables with a gentle de|scent, and to dig a sewer to collect all the water. By this means the cattle will ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al|ways dry, and the dung will run no risque of growing sour. Horned cattle contract a habit, sometimes, of licking one another; and that hurts them to such a degree, that a butcher who perceives it, will give less money for them than for others. They are cured of this trick by rubbing the places they have licked with cow-dung, the bitterness of which prevents them from re-attempting it.</P>
<P>The desire of profiting by the milk of the cow, is often the cause of the calf's being
<PB N="146" REF="015597_0152_0F998DE4854770C0">
too early weaned. A month or two more, in fine, the time required by nature, would strengthen it in its youth: it would grow more successfully, and in time, fetch a profit with good interest. But this is scarce done any where. No sooner is it believed that it may subsist without the mother's milk, than the farmer thinks he gains a great deal by weaning it: ill-fed, and infirm, it grows at best to be a sorry bull, or feeble bullock, from which little profit can be derived, and much less service.</P>
<P>The principal source of this abuse arises from ignorance, and want of reflection. People either do not know, or do not reflect, that the vital-fire inclosed in the heart of a new-born animal, must be augmented; that it attracts and is nourished by that contained in the milk; that this vital fire, weak at first, would scarce have power to separate the aux|iliary fire from the milky particles with which it is incorporated, if milk was a less delicate substance than nature hath formed it for this first service; but in proportion as the vital fire acquires force, the milk grows thick, because its grosser particles are destined for forming and consolidating the body of the animal. When the vital fire is arrived at such a degree, as to be superior to the suc|cours which the milk can afford, nature ex|cites the animal to seek a more solid nourish|ment, and then, but not till then, is the
<PB N="147" REF="015597_0153_0F998DE51A9A3610">
time of weaning it. For, by anticipating that time, they run the risque of leaving the animal imperfect in its interior parts: the ali|ment which is administered, being above its strength, it cannot perform a perfect digesti|on, and the nourishment it receives, is so much the less, as in all natural bodies, the strongest juices, and most efficacious quali|ties, are always comprehended; and as it were, imprisoned in the hardest particles. Hence it happens, that a sickly animal does not derive from the same food, so much nourishment as an animal in health. In ef|fect, the vital heat, too much employed, in resisting the attacks of the corrupted humours, hath not force enough to extract from the aliment, the necessary auxiliary fire, which is concealed in its bosom. Besides, the food being but ill dissolved, passes to excrement, producing only a meagre inefficacious dung.</P>
<P>As therefore, we may be assured, by weaning a half too early, that it will remain infirm, and of small value; in like manner by leaving it with the mother, as long as its constitution requires, we may expect it will become strong and vigorous, and by follow|ing this method, we can hardly fail of rais|ing a breed of cattle, that will redound both to the honour and profit of the farmer.</P>
<P>Young calves are apt to be attacked by in|sects, which disturb and torment them, while at the same time they prevent their fatten|ing.
<PB N="148" REF="015597_0154_0F998DEA02938FA8">
In order to preserve them from these insects, and even cure them when they are hurt, it will be proper to prepare an oint|ment of melted hogs-greese and mercury, which must be kneaded till they are well mixed together. Spread this ointment upon a linen cloth, then wrap it up in three folds, stitch it for a collar to the calves, and it will not only cure them, but likewise disperse the insects.</P>
<P>There is no better nourishment for the young animals, than vetches soaked in wa|ter, till they swell; but observe to steep no more than will serve them for once, because when they remain a long time in moisture, they are apt to grow sour, and so would do them more harm than good.</P>
<P>We shall not insist upon the advantages at|tending the breeding of young cattle, what|ever trouble it may cost; because there is no prudent country-man who is not fully per|suaded of them. To buy what he may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his own growth; is to a farmer no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a dissipation; because the land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no money, which is only to be ob|tained with commodities, and very often the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chase of some goods destroys all the pro|fit r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sulting from the sale of others.

<P>These fathers, out of their uncommon generosity, and with a view to the public ad|vantage, have communicated to us, the se|cret of cultivating them, that we may im|part it to the public in our journal.&mdash;It was from them that the Revd. Fathers Peni|tents of Piepus, had the same receipt, which they now practise with success.</P>
<P>Take a quantity of the ordinary horse-radish seed, steep it in river-water, for the space of four and twenty hours; then put the whole wet as it is, in a little linen bag, well secured with pack-thread: but if you have steeped a great quantity of the seed, it must be divided into several bags: expose the bag or bags to the heat of the sun, for about four and twenty hours. At the expiration of which, the seed will have begun to shoot, and you must sow it like any other grain, in land well exposed to the sun. Prepare two tubs of such dimensions, as that the one will exactly cover the other; these may be easily procured, by sawing a cask into two equal

<P>Immediately after the seed is sown, it must be covered with a tub, and at the end of three days, you will find your Radishes as large as small Civet, of a white colour, hav|ing at their extremity two small, round, yel|low or reddish leaves about the earth, and ready to be cut or plucked for sallad. These are of a much more delicate taste than the ordinary Radishes, which are always eaten with salt.</P>
<P>By taking these precautions, you may have them in the most severe frosts. After hav|ing steeped the seed in lukewarm water, and exposed it to the sun (as we have already observed) or in a warm place, so as that it shall shoot; warm two tubs, fill one of them with earth well smoaked, there sow your seed, and cover it with the other tub, You must take care to water it always with luke|warm water, and to carry the two tubs ex|actly placed over one another, and well joined, into a cellar, or some warm place under ground: at the end of fifteen days, you may gather your sallad.</P>

His me|thod is to cut the tops in the spring of the first year; and the reason is, that the root, of consequence, receiving the nourishment of the juices, which it must have furnished to the top, spreads, gathers strength, and is
<PB N="157" REF="015597_0163_0F998DF2888BD208">
in a condition of putting forth much strong|er tops the following years. He adds, that to deny this fact, is to be ignorant, or pre|tend to be ignorant of all the principles of vegetation, which inform us, that the deep|er and more extensive the roots are, the finer and more vigorous will the plant be pro|duced from these roots. And these princi|ples are so well established, that he knows, he says, several farmers who mow their wheat when green, that the roots becoming strong|er, may put forth a greater number of stalks, longer ears, and larger grains.</P>
<P>With regard to the forced asparagus, he admits, that these raised in winter, are much inferior to those that come in the ordinary season; but he affirms, that by hastening them a month or six weeks only, there is no danger of their losing their fine relish. He observes, that asparagus makes an excep|tion from all the productions of the earth, which receive from the air and sun, the fla|vour that constitutes their principal merit. What th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se gain by being exposed to the fresh air, and the heat of the sun, asparagus loses; and for a proof of this assertion, he appeals to common experience, by which we find, that the longer asparagus is left stand|ing, after appearing above ground, the more the relish is diminished. It is the earth heated with dung, that gives the flavour: the delicate juices evaporate in the air, and
<PB N="158" REF="015597_0164_0F998DF31D596998">
the sun renders the Asparagus hard and tough. Wherefore, as soon as the frosts are over, and a fermentation begins in the sur|face of the earth; asparagus, which abhors cold, as well as heat, sprouts successfully, possessed of all the flavour which the soil, where it is planted, is able to communicate: it dreads nothing but the prejudices with which people are too easily blinded, and which contradicting experience, extinguish in the gardener, the desire of perfecting his art, and deter him from submitting to a la|bour, from which he is likely to reap but small advantage.</P>
<P>We shall not relate here in what manner he heats the ground: it is the same method as taught in all books of gardening, for rais|ing asparagus in winter, with this difference, however, that whereas others perform that operation before, he never commences it, till after the frosts. If the reasons given by this lover of agriculture, are as solid as they appear, we hope that those, whose ex|perience (the only mistress to be relied upon in this subject,) confirms them, will com|municate their success to the public, that every body may learn how to procure as early as possible, and of the best kind, a pulse so justly coveted in all families; a pulse which of all kitchen plants, most certainly is ac|companied with the greatest advantages, ac|cording to the expression of a modern author,
<PB N="159" REF="015597_0165_0F998DF44D487B70">
a real master of the art of useful gardening, and the best of any who have treated that subject. <HI>The school of kitchen gardening,</HI> which he hath lately published, renders it needless to give in our journal, the instructive memorials we have in our possession, con|cerning that favourite part of agriculture; and we are resolved from henceforth, to touch no more that subject, unless we have remarks or additions to make, better or equal at least, in merit to the excellent de|finitions and principles of agriculture, which that author hath so learnedly and amply ex|plained, in the forementioned work.</P>
<P>This is a rule which we propose to follow in matters of agriculture, as likewise never to republish in our journal what hath been al|ready communicated to the public in our language, except in certain cases, and that in particular which we have now already mentioned, of observations, criticisms, or additions. This method we look upon as the most simple and most likely to satisfy the curious, without multiplying memorials, the repetition of which would only obscure the subject, and tire the reader. We may, therefore boldly presume, if our essays ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neither extensive nor numerous, that they will at least have the merit with considerate persons, of improving their knowledge, and conducting them some steps in the road of utility.</P>
