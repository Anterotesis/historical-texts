<Q><P><HI>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou dye before thy time?</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOlomon being a man full of wisdome, was very ob|servant of the Providences of God, which hapned in the place and in the age wherein he lived. He doth in this Chapter give us an account of some of his Observations that way, There is one special Observation in this Context, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> in the 15 verse of this Chapter, where we have the wise man saying, <HI>There is a just man that perisheth in his Righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> life in his wickedness.</HI> Now lest any one should abuse this doctrine of the just mans perishing in his righteousness; and the wicked mans prolonging his life in his wickedness, He proceeds to a double exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. He doth exhort to beware of errors on the right hand. verse 16th. where there are two errors on the right hand mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. Overmuch Righteousness. <HI>Be not righteous overmuch.</HI> Not that it is possible for any man to have more of real Goodness in him, than he ought to have: but he may be more righteous in his own Conceit, than he should be; and he may be Superstitious, he may adde to the Word of God, which is the rule of Righteousness, Men may like|wise be more severe in punishing Offenders then the Rule doth allow of, the Corinthians did sometimes erre on that hand, and that is to be righteous overmuch.</P>
<P N="2">2, Overmuch Wisdome. <HI>Neither make thy self overwise&punc;</HI> which must be understood as the former Particular, A man
<PB N="2" REF="000210_0005_0FA317B345FE39B8">
be wiser in his own eyes, than he ought to be, He may be wise above what is written, He may pry into the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">crets of the Almighty, and endeavour to trace him whose w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yes, are past finding out, and whose Footsteps are not known. And this Exhortation is urged from the Consideration of the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull effect of this overmuch wisdome and righte|ousness, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> self destruction. <HI>Why shouldest thou destroy thy self?</HI> As the moth that will venture too neer to the light, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">troyeth it self, so they that will be overwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and will needs know more than God would have them to know, destroy themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other exhortation is against Errors on the Left hand; <NOTE PLACE="marg">v. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> An|not. in Loc.</NOTE> of which there are two mentioned in this verse and in the words which have been read, in opposition to the two former spoken of in the verse immediately foreg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing.</P>

P&punc; 85.</NOTE> q. d. though you must not be righteous overmuch, yet take heed of erring on the other extream, which our nature is most prone unto.

<P N="2">2. Another error on the left hand is Foolishness. <HI>Nei|ther be thou Foolish.</HI> Heb. <GAP DESC="foreign"> h. e. <HI>Neither be thou a Fool,</HI> because all wickedn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss is folly, and sinners are Fools, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yamet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i ali|quando <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it ut impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i in su|is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ribus Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">men <GAP DESC="foreign"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it ut imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|borum br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">v's &amp; contracts vita <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it. <HI>Cart|wright</HI> in Loc.</NOTE> as afterwards we shall shew. And this exhortation is likewise pressed by an argument taken from the raiserable end that such sinners come to at last, God in his righteous Providence doth many Times so order that they dy before their Time. <HI>Why shouldest thou dy before thy Time?</HI> It is as if it were said, Though it be so that here and there a wicked man doth prolong his life in his wickedness, yet for any one thence to embolden himself in sin, is the greatest folly imaginable, for usually it falls out otherwise, that wicked|ness doth shorten the dayes of those that are guilty of it.</P>
<P>The Doctrine therefore from the words is, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>That the Providence of God doth oftentimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o dispose as that an untimely death shall be the Portion of him that hath been wicked overmuch.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000210_0006_0FA317B406595208">In the Doctrinal handling of this Truth, Three things may be attended.</P>
<P N="1">1. To enquire how any one may be said to dy before his Time.</P>
<P N="2">2. What overmuch wickedness that is which is usually followed with untimely Death, or when one may be said to be wicked overmuch.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Reasons of the Doctrine, why God in his pro|vidence doth often so dispose as that an untimely death shall be the Portion of such as have been wicked overmuch.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How can one be said to dy before his Time?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Not in respect of the decree of God.</HI> No man shall dy before the Time which the Lord hath determined be fulfilled. The Time of every mans Death is appointed. Hence Job saith Chap. 14. verse 14. <HI>All the dayes of my appointed Time will I wait till my change come.</HI> and in the 5th verse of that Chapter it is said, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing his day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s are de|termined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">See Mr Cotton on Eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 7.17.</NOTE> Not onely the years but the moneths, nay the dayes which every man shall live are determined by the Lord, so as that he shall not live a day longer, nor dy a day sooner than was before appoint|ed. But a man may be said to dy before his Time.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In respect of his own expectation.</HI> He may dy before ever he doth expect Death. Hence sinners are said to dy suddenly. 1 Thess. 5. 3. <HI>When they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travel upon a woman with child and they shall not escape.</HI> Sudden destruction cometh upon sinners, that is, not onely which is in it self sudden, but as to their expectation so. Thus in the Parable concerning the wicked servant. Math. 24. 48, 49, 50. <HI>If that evil servant shall say in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow-ser|vants, the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.</HI> So doth He dy before his Time wherein he expected death is come. It is often so with them that have been very wicked and Foolish; wherefore it is said in the Parable concerning
<PB N="4" REF="000210_0007_0FA317B4C51671C8">
the Fool when he thought he had many years to live. Luke 12. 20. <HI>God said unto him Thou Fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee.</HI> Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A sinner may be said to dye before his Time, in respect of his Preparation for a dying hour.</HI> Death may come upon him, before he is prepared to encounter with that enemy. And then he dyeth indeed, <HI>in dying he shall dy,</HI> if death find him unprepared; the second death taketh hold on that soul. The devills sometimes said to Jesus Christ, <HI>Art thus come to torment us before our Time.</HI> Truly such a soul goeth to the Place of Torment before his Time. There is many a sinner that death finds without an Interest in Jesus Christ, There is some sin that he hath not repented of, nay it may be he hath not truly repented of so much as one sin, and then he is not prepared to dy. It had been better for him that he had never been born, than that he should dye and go out of the world in that Con|dition,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A sinner may dy before that Time be fulfilled, which according to the ordinary course of nature he might have lived.</HI></P>
<P>And this is especially intended here in the Text. why shouldst thou dye <HI>before thy time,</HI> Hebr. <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>and not in thy Time.</HI> that is to say, before that time which ac|cording to the ordinary course of nature thou mighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t have lived, be expired. Many times the Divine Providence doth so order as that they who have been wicked over|much shall not live out that time. Thus concerning the world of the ungodly which lived before the flood, Eliphaz saith <HI>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have troden,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">See Mr Caryl <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">b 22. 16.</NOTE> <HI>who were cut down out of time,</HI> Job. 22. 15, 16. According to the ordinary course of Nature, they might have lived a Long Time, but they were cut down by the stroke of Death. wicked men never by before they are ripe in sin, but they often dy before they are ripe in Na|ture. They are caried and chased out of the world by some violent death.</P>
<P>Sometimes this is brought to pass by the Lords immedi|ate hand. If men be generally wicked overmuch, the Lord
<PB N="5" REF="000210_0008_0FA317B585981D18">
sends Publick destroying Judgments, whereby thousands dy before their Time. so on the old world, so on Sodom and Gomorrh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; in the morning they were well and likely to have lived many a fair day, but dead and damned be|fore night. Those sore Judgments of Famine, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ague, and Sword, come and sweep away multitudes before their time, when a people are become wicked overmuch. And Particular Judgments do hence come upon Particular per|sons, whereby they were cut of <HI>before their Time.</HI> There was that wicked <HI>Er</HI> and his wicked brother <HI>Onan,</HI> did commit abominable uncleaness in the sight of God, and therefore the <HI>Lord slew them,</HI> that they <HI>dyed before their Time.</HI> so <HI>Nadab and Abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> were wicked overmuch, and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord. <HI>Corah</HI> and his com<HI>p</HI>lices <HI>wickedness was amongst them and in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and as the Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mist (alledging to that very Judgment) speaketh <HI>Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eised upon them and they went down quick into hell.</HI> Psal. 55.15. Ananias and Saphira were wicked overmuch when they committed Sacriledg, and also sinned and lyed in a Church Assembly where there is a special Presence of the Spirit of God, and they became guilty of lying to the Holy Ghost, wherefore first the one of them fell down and gave up the Ghost, and then the other, and thence were both cast into one grave and this before their Time. The Scripture is full of awfull instances to this Purpose. Again sometimes Gods Vicegerents are improved as executioners of his wrath and justice upon such sinners. The Magistrate beareth not the sword in vain, but is the Minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill. Hence David speaketh saying, <HI>I will early destroy all the wicked of the Land, that I may cut of the wicked doers from the city of the Lord.</HI> Psal. 110.8. I will early destroy them, in the original it is, <HI>in the morning</HI> I will destroy them, because in those Times <HI>Malefactors</HI> were <HI>executed</HI> in the morning; and thats his meaning, that He would see <HI>execution</HI> done upon Capital <HI>Offenders.</HI> Thus S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ls cursed Posterity was cut off by the hand of Justice,
<PB N="6" REF="000210_0009_0FA317B644EC8B38">
because of the <HI>Murther</HI> which their Father had commited, and no doubt but they had been same way Accessary, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, or approving, or not duly bearing witness against that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Sometimes again the Lord in a Judicial way giveth up such sinners to the Power of Satan, and their own Corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, so as that they become their own execu|tioners, as we se in <HI>Judas,</HI> who after he had brought himself under the guilt of innocent blood, went to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to let out his wretched soul,</P>
<P>But thus much may suffice to be spoken to the first en|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y, we come to the second thing propounded, Namely, <HI>What overmuch wickedness that is which is usualy followed With untimely death, or when a man may be said to be wicked overmuch?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>When he doth make himself to be more wicked than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">.</HI> e. g. When he doth falsly accuse himself to be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y of this or that which he was never actually guilty of. There are such woful foolish creatures in the world, that glory in their shame, and take a pride in saying that they have committed this or that abomination, which yet it may be they never did commit. It is just with God, that such should <HI>dy before their Time,</HI> and that they should be dealt with, as if they were really guilty thereof; as we se in the Instance of that Amalekite, who accused him self as having an hand in Sauls death. It is a question whether he had so really or no, yet inasmuch as he accused Himself, David condemned him, 2 Sam 1. 16. <HI>David said thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying, I have slain the Lords anointed.</HI> So when any poor creature shall say that he hath out-stood and sinned away the day of Grace, albeit the Holy Spirit is secretly striving with him still, or that he hath sinned against the Holy-Ghost. Or that his sin is greater than the mercy God. As <HI>Francis Spira</HI> after his Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tacy uttered such a des|perate blasphemy as that <HI>my sin</HI> (said He) <HI>is greater than the mercy of God.</HI> And thus it was with despairing bloody Cain, he said, <HI>mine iniquity is greater than can be forgiven.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="000210_0010_0FA317B704FE2708">
Gen. 4. 13. <HI>Austin</HI> doth well reply upon him, <HI>mentiris Cain,</HI> thats a Lye Cain, thy sin is not greater then can be forgiven. <NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ker on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t. 2&punc; 37.</NOTE> Some have observed that Cains Desperation and blasphemy, was a greater evil than his <HI>Murther</HI> was, when he shed the innocent blood of his own Brother.

<P N="2">2. <HI>When a man shall become guilty of such sins as are of a very hainous nature, then he may be said to be wicked overmuch.</HI> There are Scarlet sins, Crimson abominations, which the Heavens blush to behold.

<P><HI>Murther</HI> is a great and horrid wickedness, and so Capital as that whoever hath been guilty of it, may in no case be pardoned by man. Numb. 35. 30, 31. <HI>Whoso Kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th any person, the murtherer shall be put to death, moreover they shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murtherer which is Guilty of death, but He shall be surely put to death.</HI> And they that have been guilty of this <HI>wickedness,</HI> usually <HI>dy before their Time,</HI> according to that scripture Psal. 55. 23. <HI>But thou O God shalt bring them down to destruction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and deceitfull men should not live out half their dayes.</HI> It is thought by some that Cain.

<P>And thus have wee done with the second thing propoun|ded in order to the cleering of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> before us.

<P>For Answer, we shall onely mention two <HI>Reasons,</HI> breifly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE><HI>The Lord doth this that he may manifest his righteous

displeasure against sin</HI> Hebr. 1. 13. <HI>He is of purer eyes than to behold evill, and cannot look on iniquity,</HI> that is to say with approbation or without detestation and indignation against sin. The blessed Holy God doth bear an infinite detestation and indignation against sin. Hence he leaveth <HI>Marks of his displeasure</HI> upon the sinner, as God set a <HI>mark</HI> upon Cains forehead, so he sets a <HI>mark of displeasure</HI> upon notorious Transgressors. Yea sometimes when he forgiveth the sin, yet he doth visit with Temporal vengeance, that so the world may see that sin is odious and abominable in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of God. Hence such sinners as the Text speaketh of, <HI>must dye before their Time.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>That so others may thereby be warned and deterred from the Commission of the like evills.</HI> Thus it was with Lots wife, she dyed before her Time, that so others might be warned by her example, to beware of becoming guilty of the same sin, which she was so awfully punished for. there|fore Christ said to his disciples, Luke. 17. 32. <HI>Remember Lots wife,</HI> meaning so remember her, as that you may for ever take heed of doing as she did. She was turned into a pillar of salt, that others might be seasoned thereby and preserved from the like evill. God is wise and wonderfull in his Pro|vidences, and knoweth how to order the death of two or three so as to prevent the destruction of many thereby. Hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e hath appointed that Justice shall be <HI>executed</HI> in a solemn way, upon <HI>Capital offenders,</HI> that others may hear and fear, and none may do any more so wickedly. We find the Lord himself giveth this Reason of this matter. Deut. 13. 8,9, 11. <HI>Thou shalt not hearken unto him, neither shall thine eye pitty him, neither shalt thou spare, but thou shalt surely Kill him; and all Israel shall bear and fear and shall doe no more any such wickedness as this is among you.</HI></P>
<P>Wee come now to Apply this Doctrine. There are two Uses to be insisted on, 1. By way of <HI>Instruction</HI> or <HI>Infor|mation</HI> 2. By way of <HI>Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. By way of <HI>Information,</HI> Inf. 1. <HI>We may see by this, that sin is the greatest folly in the world.</HI> Well might Solomon say as in the Text, <HI>neither her be thou foolish,</HI> For to sin and doe
<PB N="13" REF="000210_0016_0FA317BB859D58F0">
wickedly is the greatest foolishness that ever was or can be. Sin is a departure from the Rule of Wisdome. For a man to part with his life for nothing, is not that monstrous folly? And thus doth a wretched sinner doe. Mens sins are unfruit|full works of darkness. What Profit had you of those things whereof ye are now ashamed? Sin is the most unprofitable thing in the world. It is good for nothing, neither for body, nor soul, nor name, nor estate, but brings death and ruin upon all. A man by sin (especially some sins) looseth his Name. A wound and dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onour doth he get, and a reproach that that shall not be wiped away. And he lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth his life, and that <HI>before the Time</HI> as the Text sheweth; yea and without repentance will loose his soul for ever. Prov. 8. 36. <HI>Hee that sinneth against me wrongs his own soul.</HI> The Impenitent sinner brings ruin upon his own soul. Therefore sin is folly, and and the more sinfull the more foolish. The greatest Sinners are the greatest Fooles in all the world. Wherefore it is said Eccl 9. 3. <HI>The Heart of the sons of men is full of evill, &amp; madness is in their Heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</HI> Yea to the Damned! O what horrible madness is it, for any man, that so he may enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, to venture eternall damnation of his precious and immortall soul?</P>
<P>Infor. 2. <HI>It followeth from hence, that shortness of dayes is in it self a judgment.</HI> For it is threatned as a Punishment of wickedness. It is a fruit of sin and of the curse. If Adam had not sinned there would have been no short lives, none of his Posterity should have had their lives shortned. And in the times of the Restitution of all things, when the Curse shall be removed, it will not be as at this day. Rev. 21. 4. <HI>There shall be no more death.</HI> To be sure there shall be no more such untimely death as our eyes doe with sadness be|hold this day. Look as long life is in it self a blessing, and therefore is Promised as such in the Scripture Psal. 91. 16. <HI>With long life will I satisfie him,</HI> Prov. 4. 10. <HI>Receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be many.</HI> and 10. 27. <HI>The fear of the Lord prolongeth dayes.</HI> Whatever any true bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iver hath done or suffered for, or according to the will
<PB N="14" REF="000210_0017_0FA317BC45B73DD8">
of God, whilst he was in the world; shall come in upon the account at the last and great day, a glorious reward of mercy shall be given for it, thence is it, so great a mercy to live long. So on the other hand, sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is a great judgment, and is often threatned as such in the Scripture. Prov. 10. 27. <HI>The years of the wicked shall be shortned.</HI> Eccles. 8. 13. <HI>Neither shall he prolong his dayes,</HI> And it is mentioned as an heavy Im|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tion. Psal&punc; 109. 8. <HI>Let his dayes be few.</HI> For when a wicked man dyeth (dying in his sins) He is undone for ever. when once his body is <HI>gone down into the pit</HI> of the grave, and his soul is <HI>gone down into the pit</HI> of eternall darkness, He can|not hope for the mercy of God, He cannot hope for the par|don of his sin, He cannot hope for the salvation of his soul. Therefore short life is in it self a judgment. Onely as to the elect of God, it is turned into a mercy. As afflictions are in themselves evill and fruits of the curse, but to beleivers they become the greatest blessings. So an untimely death is in it self a great evill, but to one that belongs to the election of grace, it becometh a wonderfull mercy; for it hasteneth his eternall hapiness and glory.</P>
<P>Infor. 3. <HI>Hence it likewise followeth that Righteousness is the way to obtain long life.</HI> If wickedness bring untimely death, then <HI>Righteousness will deliver from death.</HI> There is no righ|teous man, but shall live in this world so long as life shall be good for him to enjoy.</P>
<P>But some one will say, do we not see that good men dye when they are young as well as others?</P>
<P>Answ. Very true. As there are some that are <HI>too wicked to live long,</HI> So there are others that are <HI>too Good to live long;</HI> in such an evill wretched world as this. Jeroboams godly son, dyed in his youth. Josiah a most emi|nent servant of the Lord, dyed in the midde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of his dayes. Enoch though the best man, and the best minister of God, in all the world in his time, was taken out of the world before he had lived half so long as men in those dayes were wont to live, but then it would not be good for them to live any longer. God is <HI>onely wise</HI> and faithfull, and therefore he taketh his servants to himself, when he seeth that life will not be best for them.</P>

Some live longer in seven years, then others doe in ten times seven years. They doe more for God and more for his People in seven years then others do in twenty, forty, threescore, or in fourscore years. Moreover, that promise of long life will be fulfilled to the righteous in the life to come. As indeed all promises (and threat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ings too) are fully accomplished in the world to come.

brought him unto, therefore beware of that sin.</P>
<P>And <HI>Idleness</HI> is a sin that doth bring many to a miserable end at last. It was one of those sins which caused thousands in Sodom and Gomorrah to <HI>dy before their Time</HI> in a dreadfull manner. As for one of these poor condemned Creatures <HI>Idleness</HI> hath been his bane. He would not diligently fol|low the calling which he was set in, but lived an Idle va|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant life, and what is he now come to? Therefore beware of that sin.</P>
<P>And <HI>Disobedience to Parents</HI> is a sin that is often punished with untimely death. (as was partly intimated before) One of these that are to be <HI>executed</HI> this day, doth confess that his disobedience to his Parents hath provoked the Lord, to bring this misery upon him. He faith that when he was a Child his Father gave him good Instructions and prayed for him, but he regarded it not. His Father would have had him gone to School, but he would not. His Father would have had him gone to a Trade but he would not; And after his Father was dead, he would not be subject to those that had the care and charge of him, but ran away from them, and since that from time to time hath run away from them that have been his Masters. And now behold what all this disobedience, hath brought him unto. All you <HI>disobedient Children</HI> that are here before the Lord this day, hearken to the Word of the Lord. There is a Scripture which methinks should strike Terror and Trembling into your Souls, It is that Prov. 30. 17. <HI>The eye that mocketh his Father and despi|seth to obey his Mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.</HI> The eye that mocketh his Father. Stubborne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and contempt is to be seen in the eye, therefore the meaning is, that he that is stubborn and rebellious against his Father, shall be so dealt with. Well, a Father hath many times that Wisdome and Authority with him, that the child dare not disobey him, but he careth not for his Mother; Therefore it is added, <HI>He that despiseth to obey his Mother.</HI> You Children that disobey your Mothers hearken to this; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ens are like to feed upon you; that is to say such sin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rs shall come to an untimely death, and it may be not have

It is to be feared that such children will come to the Gallows, and be hanged up in Gibbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s for the ravens and eagles to feed upon them if they will. And it is greatly do be observed, that the most of those that dy upon the Gallows, do confess that they have been guilty of diso|bedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce to Parents. Yea God is so provoked with such wicked children, as that he doth sometimes leave them against nature to destroy themselves as a just Punishment of unna|turall disobedience. There was an awfull example of this, which hapned in this Country about fifteen years agoe. I was not my self in this Land at that time, but I have had an account of it from those that knew it. A young man drowned himself, but before he did that, he left a writing directed to his Father, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abraham Warner</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d in Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cticut.</NOTE> wherein he had such words as these, <HI>O Father, I have kept my soul as long as ever I could; My ruine was, the pride and stubbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ness of my tender years, which should have been fetcht out with sharp correction; and evill counsel and company <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath been my undoing. I have a young brother that follows my steps, he is going the wide way to destruction, I beseech you take pains with him &amp; correct him as well as counsel him, that he may not be undone soul and body as well as I.</HI> Words to this pur|pose, did that perishing young man (though the son of a Godly Father) write when he was going into eternity. You <HI>disobedient children</HI> think of it, and the Lord strike it home to your Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Drunkenness</HI> also, is a sin, that often brings those that are guilty of it to a miserable end at last. A vile creature, it may be when he is drunk, He will goe and drown himself, and his soul goe down into eternall darkness in that condition, or he will commit some horrid sin, for which the sword of Justice will Cut him off. When he is drunk He will commit Adul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ety, or a Rape it may be. Alass we hear that such a vil|lany hath been Committed of late, in a Plantation not far off; Or in his drink Hee'le Kill a man, and so <HI>dye before his Time.</HI> Therefore beware of that sin.</P>
<P>And <HI>Covetousness</HI> is a sin, which many Times brings un|timely death, It did so upon A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">han. The Love of money is is the root of all evill. This hath occasioned many a bloody

<P>And there is a Tragical story lately printed, of a profane young man, that Killed his own Mother that bare him, out of hopes that when she was dead, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Henry Jones who was executed at Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mouth to Wales March 11. 1671.</NOTE> He should enjoy her estate. For which he was put to a most dreadfull Death, weights of iron and stone were layed upon him for two dayes together, until his life and soul were pressed out of his body. This <HI>execution</HI> was was done just about four years agoe. There|fore take heed and beware of Covetousness.</P>
<P>Also take heed of giving way to passions, revenge, anger and the like. These two condemned creatures, their master corrected them, and as they thought dealt hardly with them, and therefore in wicked passion, wrath, and rage they would take an axe and knock him in the head, for which now they must dye.</P>
<P>Beware also of giving way to <HI>Discontents</HI> and sullen <HI>Me|lancholy,</HI> for that also causeth some to dye before their Time. There is a lamentable story lately Published, of a woman that in pangs of Melancholy discontent went to distroy her self several times, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><ABBR>viz</ABBR> <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y</HI> Cooke who was executed in Smith-field in London <HI>M</HI>arch 2. 1669</NOTE> but was by the Providence of God prevented, but afterwards giving way to those Temptations, and not humbling her self on the account of former miscariages, she embrewed her hands in the blood of her own Child, for the which she was afterwards executed, near to the place where she had committed that unnatural Cruelty and <HI>Mur|ther.</HI> Therefore let us beware of giving way to the distem|pered workings of our own spirits.</P>
<P>But thus for the word of General Exhortation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me more particularly exhort, <HI>those that have been wicked overmuch.</HI> You that have been guilty of great sins
<PB N="21" REF="000210_0024_0FA317C186182A58">
and provocations before the Lord, <HI>O Repent and turn to God in Jesus Christ,</HI> Return Return O sinners return return. Stop sinners! stop. goe no further, if you love your lives goe no further, <HI>why should you dye before your Time?</HI> It may be Repentance may save your Lives. There have been some that have been guilty of Capital Crimes, yet when they have repented and turned to God in Jesus Christ, He hath covered their sins, that the world hath never known of them. However if there be true Re|pentance, the lives of your souls shall be saved. In some cases Repentance cannot prevent the <HI>first death,</HI> but it will alwayes (if sound and sincere) prevent the <HI>second death.</HI> Oh! then Turn to God in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And I would apply this more Particularly unto these poor Guilty Condemned Creatures, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicholas Feaver</HI> who was born in the Isle of Jersey. and <HI>Robert Driver</HI> who was born in the Isle of <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> in <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">land.</HI></NOTE> who are standing in the solemn presence of the Lord, and whose naked souls must by and by appear before God the Judge of all, to receive a Sentence either of eternal Life, or of eternal Death. Hearken you to the word of the Lord this once. I beseech you mind what I say, because you are now come unto your last hour. It may be there are many here this day, that this is the last Sermon, that ever they shall hear, but as for you the thing is Certain, you shall never hear ano|ther Sermon; and therefore let these words sink down into your Ears and Hearts.</P>
<P>A few <HI>Considerations</HI> and <HI>Directions</HI> let me spread be|fore you.</P>
<P N="1">Consider. 1. <HI>That you have been wicked overmuch.</HI> The sin which you are now to dye for is exceeding great, even <HI>Murder.</HI> The Scripture faith that <HI>no Murderer hath eternal life.</HI> And there is another Scripture that saith, that <HI>Mur|derers shall have their Part in that Lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second Death.</HI> And no doubt you have been guilty of many other Greivous sins, which have provoked the Lord to leave you unto the Com|mission of this horrid <HI>Murther.</HI> This <HI>Murther</HI> also is exceedingly aggravated in respect of the person whom you have slain, even your <HI>Master.</HI> O, how have you risen up in
<PB N="22" REF="000210_0025_0FA317C246EFB220">
Rebellion against the glorious Image of God, not onely in that you have shed the blood of a man, who was made after the <HI>Image of God,</HI> but such a man as had peculiar <HI>Dominion</HI> over you, in that respect you have offered fear|full violence to the sacred Image of the blessed God. So that you have tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">grest the <HI>fifth and sixth Commandments</HI> at once in the highest degree that you could doe. And since your Apprehension, yea Conviction and Condem|nation you have told many lies (at least one of you, it is to be feared both of you) against your Conscience.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider that <HI>now you must dye before your Time,</HI> especially one of you, a poor young creature that hath hardly lived twenty years in this world, and must this day be turned out of it. Yea both of you <HI>dy before your Time.</HI> you might according to the ordinary course of nature have lived many a year. You must be cut off by a violent and dreadfull death. For indeed the anger of the Lord would fall upon this whole Country where your sin hath been committed, if you should be suffered to live.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider, <HI>That there is yet a possibility for you to es|cape the second death.</HI> Though your sin be very great, yet God can pardon it. I remember a passage concerning a poor creature that was condemned to dye for wickedness he had been guilty of (I the rather mention it because he was Country man to one of you) but when he was in Person gave good Hopes of his unfaigned Repentance, <NOTE PLACE="marg">See the book c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. P&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">33.</NOTE> and when he came to the place of execution, He had this ex|pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ssion, <HI>O! God is a great forgiver, God is a great forgiver,</HI> so I say to you in his Name, <HI>the Lord is a great Forgiver,</HI> It is his Name to forgive iniquity Transgression and sin. Yea and He hath, (upon deep and unfaigned Repentance) for given those that have committed this sin which you are now to suffer for. Mana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">h shed much innocent blood yet when he humbled himself greatly, the Lord was en|treated for him. There are some in Heaven that were once Bloody sinners. David was <HI>delivered from Blood guiltiness.</HI> Upon his Repentance it was said to him, <HI>The Lord hath
<PB N="23" REF="000210_0026_0FA317C305E42DC0">
put away thy sin thou shalt not dye,</HI> As to <HI>the second death</HI> he did not dye. And Saul (afterwards Paul) had once the guilt of blood upon him, And therefore he made his Confession before the Lord, Saying, <HI>Lord; When the blood of thy Martyr Steven was shed, I also was standing by and Consenting to his death.</HI> Yet when he did repent and I unto God in Jesus Christ, God forgave him his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ni|quity. Know therefore, that there is Mercy enough with God to Pardon and Save as great sinners as you are.</P>
<P>And know, that Jesus Christ the Son of God, Came to <HI>Save the chief of sinners.</HI> There is Merit and Righ|teousness enough in Jesus Christ. Hee was bruised for our In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quityes, and wounded for our Transgressions. The wounds of Christ can make amends for those wounds which you gave your Master, when you slew him. The Blood of Christ can satisfie for the blood which you have shed. Jesus doth deliver from wrath to come. And he doth not exclude you from salvation by him, if you doe not by Impeni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ency &amp; Unbelief exclude your selves. Neither can the death you suffer hinder the Salvation of your souls, in case you truly repent and believe. Jesus Christ hath been made a Curse, that so he might redeem from the Curse of the Law. Yea Hee (the blessed son of God) was hanged upon a Tree, though Hee never knew any sin. only for the sins of his peo|ple; and therefore he hath sanctified all maner of deaths unto those that shall beleive on Him. Oh Consider of it and let it break your Hearts.</P>
<P N="4">4. Consider <HI>Presently it will be too late for you to think of these things.</HI> when once you are dead, when once your souls are out of your bodyes, it will be too late for you to think of these matters. There is no Repenting in the Grave, there is no Believing in Hell. Behold <HI>now</HI> is your accepted Time, <HI>now</HI> is the hour of your Salvation. If you doe not <HI>Now</HI> accept of Jesus Christ upon his own Terms, you will be undone, and damned to all Eternity.</P>
<P>By way of <HI>Direction</HI> I shall speak two or three words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Doe what you can that God may have glory by you, that lit|tle Time that you have to live.</HI> Therefore see that you solemnly

And I urge this the rather, because you have not been so ingenuous in confessing your evill, as God and men have exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cted from you. You accuse and impeach one another. The one of you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, that the other Killed his Master, and you only stood by and did not strike one blow, &amp; so doth the other say. You accuse him and he accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth you. But deceive not your selves, if you deny what you know is Truth, though God be most mercifull, yet God that made you will not have mercy on you; and though Christ be a Saviour for great sinners, Hee then will not save you. The devill hath brought your bodyes to ruin and now his great design is to destroy your souls. Hee knoweth if he can Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">wade you not to give glory to God by <HI>Confessing,</HI> he shall have your souls for ever. I tell you truly if you now disown the Truth, when once your souls are out of your bodyes, they shall suffer the vengeance of eternall fire.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Look up to God in Jesus Christ, that he would give you Rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntance and Faith unfaigned.</HI> You cannot convert your s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lves, but God can doe it, therefore look up to him for that end, and cry mightily to him, as for your lives.

I Remember it is storied of a poor woman that being Condemned to dye, as soon as the sentence was past, she fell a crying and shriking in a lamentable manner, the Judge rebuked her, and bad her hold her peace, but she replyed <HI>O my lord it is for my life, it is for my life.</HI> So I say to you, O cry to the Lord for Grace and for pardoning mercy, It is for the lives of your souls. yea it is for the lives&punc;of your Souls.</P>
<P>And further to awaken hereunto,</P>
