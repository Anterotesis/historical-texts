<HEAD>An ORATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOR what purpose, fellow-citizens are we assembled? For no less than the com|memoration of that illustrious period, when the dawning genius of America, burst through the gloom that overspread its po|litical horizon; and exhibited to the world, that splendid prologue to its future greatness, the declaration of Independence.</P>
<P>The bounded imaginations of the satel|lites of tyranny, could not calculate on such an event; the daring measure aston|ished their contracted hearts: it was re|served for Americans alone, to plan, and to execute so noble a project.</P>
<P>Let us contemplate, with seriousness, the causes of this important event; im|portant to us, to Europe and posterity.</P>
<P>Tyranny, and superstition, uniting their corrupted streams, had for ages overwhel|med the verdant plains of Europe; except here and there a free town, or petty repub|lic, emerging like an island in the ocean;
<PB N="4" REF="032496_0003_0FF2F86F1EA784D8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="3 letters">eving the disgusted eye of sympathetic philanthropy.</P>
<P>Our fore-fathers in Britain, a hardy race, for centuries, with various success, stemmed this devastating torrent; resisting as became freemen, the bold encroach|ments of prerogative, and the more insidi|ous attempts o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> a monopolizing and am|bitious hierarchy.</P>
<P>The best institutions may be perverted, the purest principles misconstrued; or cruelty and persecution, had never been decorated with the mild robe of christian|ity.&mdash;</P>
<P>The manly spirit of our ancestors re|volted at the fulsome ceremonies of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">he church, and disdained to address the Great Author of nature, with the absurd mum|mery of fantastical parade: this excited the mean vengeance of their opponents, for bigotry and superstition are insepara|ble; and being unable to convince, they determined to persecute.</P>
<P>We are all acquainted with the sequel.</P>
<P>The first settlers of this country, arriv|ed, after encountering incredible hardships and difficulties at Plymouth, in New-En|gland; there with the most unexampled fortitude and perseverance, they with the loss of half their numbers, effected a set|tlement
<PB N="5" REF="032496_0004_0FF2F871C621CF18">
on that then inhospitable shor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> and laid the corner stone of America<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> importance. Illustrious, independent souls! Could you have foreseen the high destinies of your country, the pleasing prospect had alleviated your cares, soothed your anxie|ty, and softened your rugged labors in the wilderness! But your virtues are reward|ed by that impartial Being who could a|lone form a just estimate of your merits, and posterity will remember you with gratitude.</P>
<P>Their virtues were the foundation of our happiness, their prudence of our pros|perity. Recently escaped from the fangs of oppression, they were naturally averse to, and abhorred every species of tyranny&punc; united closely by their mutual wants, dan|gers and distresses, benevolence was neces|sary. Impelled by their rigid sate to the most circumspect oeconomy, and unabating industry, the vices of the indolent and lux|urious were unknown amongst them:&mdash;their children copied the fair examples, and industry, hospitality and frugality were characteristics of their offspring. Propri|etors of the soil cleared by their own la|bor, no grinding landlord extorted with unrelenting severity an unequal share of the fruits of their exertions. No prepos|terous
<PB N="6" REF="032496_0005_0FF2F875992BF840">
hereditary distinctions insulted their understanding, and impressed them with artificial ideas of dignity. Education be|ing almost equally diffused amongst them, and being, from the nature of their situa|tion, obliged to turn their minds to va|rious objects; they acquired a degree of acuteness and penetration peculiar to them|selves, and utterly unknown to the yeo|manry of Europe. Being distant from the principal seat of government, they be|came early accustomed to the regulation of their internal affairs; and chose their provincial legislators from amongst the most virtuous and enlightened of their neighbors; so that in fact, they were re|publicans in principle, in practice, and by habit, long before they burst the bonds of usurpation, and assumed an elevation sta|tion among the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>The population of the colonies encreased beyond the most sanguine expectations; aided by numerous emigrations from Eu|rope, they advanced by rapid strides to importance; and soon became a consider|able mart for the manufactures of Britain; who received their produce in return, mutually enriching each other. They voluntarily assisted the Mother Country in a severe conflict with France, and the
<PB N="7" REF="032496_0006_0FF2F8783667EEC8">
Colonial and Britannic troops, in friendly unison, vanquished the legions, and crush|ed the aspiring hopes of the House of Bourbon.</P>
<P>Had Britain consulted her true interest she had been tenaciously cautious of break|ing this to her so necessary a connexion. But the short sighted councils of tyranny, accelerated their own disgrace. For this generous assistance, for this noble co-ope|ration, how were we rewarded? Inflated with wealth and prosperity, proud of her victories, intoxicated with success, a success to which we had so largely contributed, discovering by the effectiveness of our assistance the strength of our resources, she determined to force from us the means of supporting her overgrown importance; in the most unconstitutional manner, she determined by her parliament to tax the colonies.</P>
<P>The moderation, with which we resisted her first unjust attempts to subjugate us, are as notorious as her haughty perseve|rance in urging her despotic claims.&mdash;Blinded by the artful insinuations of an ignorant, infatuated and flagitious minis|try, deaf to the energetic remonstrances of a Chatham, a Burke, a Fox, and a Bar|re; who in vain attempted to rend the
<PB N="8" REF="032496_0007_0FF2F879CD061370">
film of prejudice from the eyes of Britain. The brilliancy of wit, the fertility of geni|us, the subtilty of logic, the solidity of reason, though fighting under the banner of justice, were shamefully defeated. The javelin of truth fell blunted from the shield of corruption, who uplifting her remorse|less arm, severed the fraternal ties that bound us together.</P>
<P><Q>Reiterated insults, roused at length the dormant spirit of America; who appeal|ing to the God of battles, sustained alone, and unsupported, the attacks of a great and powerful nation, the mistress of the ocean: from the commencement of the glorious struggle, to the capture of Bur|goyne, who led on its best appointed ar|my. Astonishing spectacle! a band of husbandmen, without any discipline, but the love of order, animated by the spirit of liberty and independence, warmed by patriotism, impelled by honor, instigated by sublime domestic affection, feeling for posterity, erected their daring crests against the proud standard of oppression, and no|bly prevailed.</Q></P>
<P>From this period, the affairs of Ame|rica assumed a promising aspect, aided by the victorious arms of France, and guided by the unerring councils of that accom|plished

general, consummate statesman, and most virtuous citizen, the far famed Washington; the surrender of a second British army at York-Town, completed our triumph.</P>
<P>It were superfluous, to detail with his|torical minuteness, the progress of the war. The most important events are im|pressed on all our memories, the beneficial effects are felt by all.</P>
<P>Many of you, doubtless, were actors in the magnificent drama, many of you have bled in the awful cause. Ye firm support|ers of our rights, ye bulwarks of liberty; the grateful remembrance of your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="3 letters">se|vering labors, your undaunted <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> your manly fortitude, are deeply engr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="4 letters"> on the breast of America, and can nev<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">r be obliterated!</P>
<P>We will imitate your virtues, we will teach our children to lisp your praises, we will not be unworthy of our ancestors.</P>
<P>The mercenary assassins of Germany, those dealers in human blood, were con|founded at your heroism; they were pre|pared to think meanly of you, and deem|ed you an easy conquest: dearly have they paid for imbruing their sacrilegious hands in the blood of freemen.</P>

All nature blasted by the withering malignity of man. Even the perfidious defection of your degenerate brethren, who under the flimsy veil of loyalty, endeavored to con|ceal the blackness of their polluted hearts, was of no avail.</P>
<P>The genius of America, like the ma|jestic oak, which derives stability from the whirlwind, and thrives in the storm; rose superior to the shocks of fortune, and strengthened in adversity.</P>
<P>France caught the sparks of liberty on the plains of America, which have kin|dled a conflagration, that has dazzled the universe; and made the despots of Europe tremble on their thrones: they combined indeed, to smother the rising flame, but instead of quenching, have fanned the de|vouring fire; that threatens to consume them.</P>
<P>The leaders of that surprising revolu|tion, deeming the rude rabble of France, unfit, as yet, to bear the full glare of light, were for softening it with a monarchie tint; and formed the incongruous project
<PB N="11" REF="032496_0010_0FF2F884A6C86010">
of blending the pageantry of a court, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word"> republican simplicity. To effect this th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> abolished the order of nobility, and admit|ted the people to a share in the govern|ment with the hereditary executive. But the ancient edifice of the monarchy, being deprived of its accustomed prop; after tottering awhile, suddenly gave way, and crushed its feeble representative in the mighty ruin. Amiable, ill-fated Capet, thou falledst a victim to thine own creduli|ty, and the malignity of party!</P>
<P>The promoters of this system abandon|ed it, and their country together; seeking amongst strangers, that repose which was denied them at home.</P>
<P>Amongst the principal of these, we count the illustrious and unfortunate La Fayette; whose unmerited sufferings are regretted by us all, whose virtues are too well known to derive lustre from eulogi|um. The democratic faction rose in the struggle, and in spite of the dreadful anar|chy that prevailed, in the midst of insur|rections, massacres, and internal convul|sions, directed the wildness of the storm with incredible dexterity. Faction des|troyed faction, revolution succeeded revo|lution; yet unmoved by the treachery of their chiefs, or the crimes of their mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter">entary

rulers, the brave defenders of their country remained firm at their post, and wherever the standard of liberty was unfurled, the nations fled before it.</P>
<P>They beat the Prussians out of their tactics, the impotent monarch of the two Indies, the king of Spain was glad to com|pound for his tottering diadem by basely deserting his allies, and joining the ene|my.</P>
<P>The executive of Holland was driven from his strong holds, although he called in the ocean to protect him.</P>
<P>Italy the garden, once the mistress of the world, notwithstanding its Alpine ramparts, notwithstanding the exertions of the venerable Wurmser, has shared the fate of its neighbors.</P>
<P>Austria alone has made a noble stand; and England through the medium of its immense riches, and decided naval superi|ority, remains the most formidable enemy of the republic.</P>
<P>Liberty, sacred liberty! We share in thy triumphs, but deprecate thine abuse. Alas! the intoxicating cup of prosperity is fraught with mischief.</P>
<P>France, who has so nobly and success|fully resisted oppression, seems to be de|viating from her first principles, aiming

<L>"Thy States in phalanx firm, a sacred band,</L>

<P>The revolution in this country, has hap|pily produced the most beneficial effects; we had not such difficulties to contend with as our brethren in France; brethren I say, for I still hope, that our unhappy differences may, through the wisdom and moderation of our rulers be adjusted, and our ancient friendship renewed.</P>
<P>We were predisposed by habit and education for the simplicity of a republic, they were sunk in ignorance and supersti|tion; they passed abruptly from the ex|treme of despotism to the most wanton li|centiousness. We had not yet felt the rod of oppression, although it was sus|pended over our heads.</P>
<P>Hence, after experiencing the ill ef|fects of an inefficient disjointed govern|ment, we adopted with almost perfect u|nanimity, and without the least tumult, our present happy system; which unites
<PB N="14" REF="032496_0013_0FF2F88B605530F0">
the vigor of the monarchic, the wisdom of the aristocratic, and the purity of the democratic forms without their incon|venience: wisely placing at the head of our affairs, the well tried Washington, who hath conducted their administration in a manner worthy of himself, and raised his grateful country to a pitch of unex|pected prosperity: May he experience in his beloved retreat but half the happiness he hath conferred on us, and ample indeed will be his recompence!</P>
<P>On the magnanimous resignation of that truly great man, whose merits are a|bove praise; we sagaciously selected from the band of patriots, for the two first of|fices of government, distinguished charac|ters worthy of their respective trusts; who bore a conspicuous share in the so|lemn transaction we are assembled to com|memorate. One was a distinguished ad|vocate for the glorious measure, the other actually drew up the declaration of Inde|pendence itself.</P>
<P>With such directors at the helm, we may fairly trust that the honor and interest of America will not be trifled with. In the mean time, let us not be lulled into a fatal security, but watch with a jealous eye over that inestimable prerogative of
