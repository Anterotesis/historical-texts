<Q><P><HI>Great Earthquakes shall be in diverse Places.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we compare <HI>Lukes</HI> Gospel with that written by <HI>Matthew,</HI> we shall find that our Lord Jesus Christ signified to His Disciples that the Temple should be subverted, the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation made the subject of Divine Vengeance, and that this world should come to an End. They privately enqui|red of Him, what should be the fore-run|ning sign of His coming to accomplish the things which He had thus Predicted. In answer to that Enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iry, Christ men|tions several Signs of His coming.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="001268_0003_0FB187CAE6C28028">1. One is the rising of False Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, in the Eighth Verse of this Chapter. The <HI>Jews</HI> rejected the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> for which cause they were punished and plagued with False Christs, which proved a sore Judg|ment to that sinful People.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Sign mentioned is that of <HI>Commotions,</HI> in the Ninth Verse; by which intestine <HI>Seditions</HI> may be meant. The Histories of those Times, inform us that the <HI>Galileans</HI> took up Arms against the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> in which <HI>Mutiny</HI> no less than Twenty Thousand men were Slain. This <HI>Commotion</HI> caused a great <HI>Consterna|tion</HI> throughout the Land.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lord tells them, that Nati|ons and Kingdoms should rise up one a|gainst another, Verse the Tenth. The <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation rose up against the <HI>Roman</HI> Nation. Distinct <HI>Provinces</HI> are called <HI>Kingdoms.</HI> Those in <HI>Syria</HI> and in <HI>Judea</HI> rose up one against another. These were Signs of fatal Calamities hastening, on the <HI>Jews,</HI> and did indeed make way for it.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Fourth Sign of the Lords Coming is that in the words before us to consider of, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Great Earthquakes, and this in diverse Places.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001268_0004_0FB187CD677F34C0">Wherefore the DOCTRINE now to be Discoursed on, is,</P>
<P><HI>That Earthquakes are Signal Works of GOD, of which there will be Great Ones, and this in diverse Places before the Lords Coming.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> may be Opened and Con|firmed in several <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>An Earthquake is the Work of God.</HI> There is not the least thing comes to pass with|out His Providence. Christ said to the Disciples, <HI>Not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without your Father,</HI> Mat. 10. 29. Then we may be sure so great a thing as an Earthquake is not without His Provi|dence. The Earth cannot shake it self; and it is beyond all the Power of all the men in the world to make an Earthquake. But God who made the Earth, can make it tremble when and where He pleaseth: Job 9. 6. <HI>He shakes the Earth out of its place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</HI> There have been Earthquakes which were Su|pernatural Miraculous Works of God: So was that on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> when the Lord Descended upon it in Fire, and <HI>the
<PB N="6" REF="001268_0005_0FB187CFB386DB60">
whole Mount Quaked greatly;</HI> Exod. 19.18. And that which swallowed up <HI>Corah</HI> and his Company with all their Houses, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 32. And that which hapn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the days of <HI>Vzziah,</HI> which put the People of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> into a great Consternation. Of this the Prophet <HI>Zechary</HI> takes notice, Zec. 14. 5. <HI>Ye shall flee like as you fled from before the Earthquake in the dayes of Uzzi|ah King of Judah.</HI> The <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian reports, that a great Mountain before <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was removed and broken in pieces by that Earthquake, and that all the High-ways were stopped by the fall of it, and the Kings Gardens of pleasure ruined thereby. Some Interpreters con|ceive that then <HI>Amos</HI> his Prophecy was fulfilled; Amos 3. 15. <HI>I will smite the Win|ter house with the Summer house, and the house of Ivory shall perish.</HI> And those <HI>Earthquakes</HI> which were at our Saviours Passion and Resurrection, were Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|natural. So was that which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Sitas</HI> Prayed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ang Praises unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">od, when they were in Prison; <HI>Suddenly there was a great Earthquake, so that the Foundations of the Prison were sha|ken, and all the Doors were opened, and every ones Bands were loosened;</HI> Act. 16. 26.
<PB N="7" REF="001268_0006_0FB187D103D09BB8">
This was Miraculous. Not only Christian, but some Heathen writers, inform us that when <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, out of his hatred of Christ, Encouraged the <HI>Jews</HI> to Rebuild the Temple, an Earthquake overturned what they had begun to Build, and Fire breaking out of the Ground consumed all the Work-mens tools, which caused them to desist from that Enter|prize. Supernatural Earthquakes are Effected either by the Almighty Power of God alone, or, by Angels as the In|struments of His Providence; Mat. 28. 2. <HI>There was a great Earthquake; for the An|gel of the Lord descended from Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> But many times, Earthquakes proceed from Natural causes. This Earth on which we stand, is not a continued substance of Earth; for then it would be impossi|ble that ever there should be an Earth|quake, without a Miracle. But there are in the bowels of the Earth great Caverns or hollow places, and mighty Lakes and Rivers, which wash away the Earth, and sometimes wash it away so far as that it sinks with its own weight; and then both Men and Houses are swallowed up: and from thence it is that great Rains and Floods do sometimes produce Earth|quakes,
<PB N="8" REF="001268_0007_0FB187D32F8855C0">
and that which before was dry Land, is turned into a lake of Water. There are also subterraneous Fires, and bituminous, sulphurous Exhalations, which are like fired Gun-powder within the Earth, causing it to shake and tremble. But notwithstanding there are Natural causes of some Earthquakes, nevertheless, they are awful Works of God. Prodi|gious Storms have Natural causes, yet <HI>those Stormy winds fulfill the Word of the Lord,</HI> Psal. 148. 8. As we have formerly from the Scripture largely Discoursed. Thunder and Lightning proceeds from Natural causes, yet is it the Lords voice, Psal. 29. 3, 4. <HI>The Voice of the Lord is upon many Waters, the God of Glory Thund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth, the Voice of the Lord is Powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Majesty.</HI> So an Earthquake is <HI>the Voice of the Lord,</HI> Ver 8. <HI>The Voice of the Lord shakes the Wilderness, the Lord shakes, the Wilderness of Kade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h.</HI> There never happens an Earthquake but God speaks to men on the Earth, by it: And they are very stupid, if they do not hear His Voice therein.</P>

<P><HI>Earthquakes are Signal.</HI> They are Pro|vidences which deserve to have a Remark
<PB N="9" REF="001268_0008_0FB187D517CB27F0">
set upon them. Wherefore the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> Expressing the date of his Prophecy, which was in the Reign of <HI>Vzziah,</HI> he sayes, <HI>It was two Years before the Earthquake,</HI> Amos 1. 1. Implying that that was a Re|markable Providence, and which ought not to be forgotten. Especially when there are <HI>Great</HI> Earthquakes or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>in diverse Places,</HI> the Providence of God therein is Signal. Indeed all E|minent Providences are so. They do <HI>Signare,</HI> they declare and signify some|thing that is notable, either as present or as to come Eminent Judgments are Signal. The Ten Plagues which came upon <HI>Egypt</HI> were so. They are called <HI>Tokens,</HI> Psal. 135. 8. <HI>Who sent Tokens in the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his Ser|vants.</HI> And Eminent Deliverances are Signal. When the <HI>Jews</HI> demanded that Christ should give them a Sign of His be|ing the Promised Messiah, He answered them, That <HI>no Sign should be given to them, but the Sign of the Prophet Jonas,</HI> Mat. 10. 39. Since <HI>Jonas</HI> was kept alive in the Whales belly three Dayes, and then cast alive on the shore to Preach to the <HI>Ninivit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> that was a Sign that God sent him; so since our Saviour after He had been three

Dayes in the Grave, was raised from thence, that was a sure Sign of His being the <HI>Messiah</HI> whom God had promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> send into the world. Remarkable Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vidences are Signal. So are Earthquakes.</P>
<P>It will be said, <HI>But what are they Sign of?</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. They are not alwayes a Sign of the same thing. Nor does God alwayes send them on the same design. Only there is one thing which they are always a Sign of; They are always<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Sign o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Power of the Great GOD. As the Earths abiding in its place is from the Power of God. For what is there besides. His Hand to uphold it? Job 26. 7. <HI>He stretches out the North over the empty place and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</HI> The Arm of Divine Omnipotence is the Pillar which keeps the Earth from falling; Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 65. 6. <HI>By His Strength He sets fast the Mountains.</HI> Whereby it appears that He is <HI>Girded with Power.</HI> So His making the Earth to shake is an Effect of His Great Power. He is <HI>Mighty in Strength;</HI> and it is manifest in that <HI>He Removeth the Mountains,</HI> and Shakes the Earth, making the Pillars thereof Tremble. <HI>Job</HI> 9. 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P>But to speak more Particularly.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="001268_0010_0FB187D7E56B3170">1. <HI>Earthquakes are sometimes, and indeed usually, a Sign that Men have Sinned, and that God is Angry.</HI> Certain it is, that if men had never Sinned, they had never been terrified with Earthquakes. There|fore at the time when God caused the Law to be Proclamed there was anEarth|quake; signifying His Holy anger against those that should Transgress that Law. The Scripture often speaks of Earth|quakes as a sign of the Wrath of God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rning against a sinful world. <HI>He over|turns the Mountains in His Anger,</HI> Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 9&punc; 5&punc; <HI>At His Wrath the Earth shall Tremble.</HI> Jer. 10. 10. <HI>The Mountains Quake at Him. Who can stand before His Indignation? His Fury is poured out like Fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by Him,</HI> Nah. 1. 5, 6. God therefore threatens to Visit men with <HI>Earthquakes</HI> as a terrible&punc; Judgment; Isa. 29. 6. <HI>Thou shalt be Visited of the Lord of Hosts, with Thunder and with Earthquake, and with great Noise:</HI> And there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> awful instances Recorded in the Script<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of <HI>horrendous Earthquakes,</HI> which were the Effects of Divine indignation for the Sins of men. It was Thunder and Light|ning and an Earthquake which Destroyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Sinners in <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrha,</HI> causing
<PB N="12" REF="001268_0011_0FB187DA9134BD48">
all their houses as well as themselves to sink down into an horrid Lake. They were Prodigious Sinners, therefore a Pro|digious Earthquake brought upon them Eternal Desolation. So when <HI>Corah</HI> and his wicked Crew by means of an <HI>Earth|quake,</HI> went down alive into Hell; it was because they had highly provoked the Lord by Sinning against Him: Numb. 16. 30. <HI>If the Earth opens its mouth &amp; swallow them up with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the Pit, then you shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord.</HI> When there was a formidable Earthquake in the Dayes of King <HI>Vzziah,</HI> the Jewish writers tell us, that it hapned at that very time when he was presumptuously offering Incense in the Temple, contrary to the Comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d|ment of God, for which he was also smitten with an incurable Leprosy. Yea, sometimes Earthquakes have been a sign of the Displeasure of God, when the Earth has only trembled without destroy|ing any person. So was that Earthquake which hapned at the time when our Sa|viour CHRIST was Crucified, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27. 51. I know some Ecclesiastical writers say, that Earthquake destroyed several Towns
<PB N="13" REF="001268_0012_0FB187DB658FAD48">
in other Lands, but none in the Land of <HI>Judea.</HI> Nevertheless, it came as a Sign of Divine Anger kindled against the <HI>Jews,</HI> for their Crucifying the Son of God, which was such a Sin as the Earth trem|bled under it. Surely then if dismal De|solations are caused by Earthquakes, the Anger of God is written in legible Cha|racters, for all the world to read and tremble. Whole Towns (as anon you shall hear) far greater than <HI>Boston,</HI> with all the People in them, Men, Women and Children, have in less than half a quarter of an Hour after the Earth has begun to shake, gone down alive into the Pit. Would such a thing be, if God were not infinitely displeased by the Sins of men?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sometimes Earthquakes in a Literal sense, are Prognosticks of Earthquakes in a Metaphorical sense.</HI> They are a Sign of State-quakes, of Church-quakes, of King|dom-quakes, of Province-quakes, Great Changes and <HI>Revolutions</HI> in the world, are in the Scripture called <HI>Earthquakes.</HI> The mighty Changes to be brought on the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church and Nation, first by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> and after that by the <HI>Romans,</HI> are Predicted by the Prophet, saying, <HI>The Foundations of the Earth do shake, the
<PB N="14" REF="001268_0013_0FB187DCF85D8CD8">
Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean dissolved, the Earth is moved exceed|ingly,</HI> Isa. 24. 18, 19. That wonderful Revolution when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, of Pagan became Christian, is doubtless in|tended by the <HI>Great Earthquake</HI> under the sixth Seal, <HI>Rev</HI> 6. 12. When <HI>Con|stantine</HI> was established in the Imperial Throne, there was a sudden and very astonishing Change of affairs, which is fit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y compared to a Great Earthquake. For that changeth the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iture of the Earth, by Exalting Valleys and Depres|sing Mountains, and turning the course of Rivers, that they run another way; and sometimes are wholly absorp't there|by. Thus it was when that good Em|peror was settled in the Throne. <HI>Pagans</HI> who had been the only men in Authori|ty, were removed from their high places, those Mountains were levelled; and Christians who were like low Valleys be|fore, were put into Chief places of Power and Trust. The Civil Government was altered with Religion. Officers and Go|vernours were new moulded throughout all the Provinces in that Empire. This was a great Earthquake. Notwithstan|ding the Empire was become Christian,
<PB N="15" REF="001268_0014_0FB187DF412CE740">
God was resolved to destroy it; to avenge the Blood of the Martyrs, which had been shed under the Heathen Emperors. Those Wars which brought mighty de|va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tations and alterations on the Empire, are denoted by the <HI>Trumpets</HI> spoken of in the Revelations, which were to cause Earthquakes, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8. 5, 6. The first of those Trumpets did (according to the judgment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Interpreters,) be|gin to Sound in the Year of our Lord Three Hundred Sixty Five, when also there was in a Literal sense the greatest Earthquake that ever had been known in the world; and this as a Sign of those Calamitous Changes which were ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tning on the Earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sometimes Earthquakes come as a Sign both of great Judgments to the World, and of signal Mercy to the Church of God.</HI> Thus when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were brought out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> altho' <HI>Moses</HI> does not mention any thing of an Earthquake, yet nevertheless, it is evident from other Scriptures that there was one then. For the Psalmist speaking of Gods bringing His People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by the hands of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> sayes, <HI>The Earth trem|bled and shook,</HI> Psal. 77. 18. That proved
<PB N="16" REF="001268_0015_0FB187E0A193E2E0">
an happy Earthquake to the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> but it presaged ruine to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> So in <HI>Joshuahs</HI> time, when the River <HI>Jordan</HI> was dried up, there was doubtless an Earthquake; as is intimated, Psal. 114. 5. 6, 7. <HI>What ailed thee, O thou Sea, that thou fleddest? Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? Ye Mountains, that ye skipped like Rams, and ye little Hills like Lambs? Tremble thou Earth at the presence of the Lord.</HI> That Earth|quake was a Sign of Gods Presence with His People, and a Presage of Destruction to their <HI>Canaanitish</HI> Enemies. It seems also, there was an Earthquake when the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were in the Wilder|ness, and ready to take possession of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which struck the <HI>E|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">omites</HI> and other Enemies with a great Terror. This we gather from a passage in <HI>Deborahs</HI> Song, Judg. 5. 4. <HI>When thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">entest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the Earth trembled.</HI> And when <HI>Jonathan</HI> surpriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Gar|rison of the Philistins, <HI>There was trembling in the Host, the Garrison trembled, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Earth quaked, so that it was a very great Trembling.</HI> This was a Sign of Gods Fa|vour to <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and of Ruine to the
<PB N="17" REF="001268_0016_0FB187E21FB69760">
<HI>Philistins.</HI> We read that when the A|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tles had Prayed, <HI>the place was shaken</HI> where they had assembled together, <HI>Act.</HI> 431. Which was a sign of Gods gracious Presence with them, that their Prayers was heard, and that by their Preaching the Gospel, there would be great shakings in the world, and changes for the better. But the happiest Earthquake that ever was, was that when Christ Rose from the Dead; signifying that He had con|quered Death, and that by vertue of His Resurrection, all true Believers on His Name, shall have a Resurrection to Eter|nal Life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Before the Lords Coming there will be Great Earthquakes, and this in diverse Places.</HI> Our Lord Himself mentions Earthquakes as a sign of His coming near at hand. We are to consider that there are several Comings of Christ spoken of in the Scrip|ture.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is His Providential Coming. When He Executes Judgments upon men then He comes to them in the way of His Providence. And this coming is firstly (tho' not ultimately) intended in the words before us. Our Saviour having
<PB N="18" REF="001268_0017_0FB187E488EC1690">
intimated to the Disciples that He would come to Execute Vengeance on the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, and to put an end both to their Civil and Ecclesiastical State, they prayed Him to tell them what would be <HI>the Signs</HI> of His coming to do it; He answers, <HI>Great Earthquakes in diverse places,</HI> will be one sign of it. Accordingly we find in Histories, that it was thus. In <HI>Neroes</HI> Reign (which was not long before the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>) Twelve Ci|ties were Destroyed by Earthquakes at one time, and Thirteen Cities at another time, in which Cities many Jews perish|ed, and on that account the warning was the more solemn to those that dwelt in the Land of <HI>Judea.</HI> And but Six years before the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Three of the most Famous Cities in <HI>Asia,</HI> were overthrown by Earthquakes. Thus were the words of Christ dreadfully Verified. The Lord seldom visits any Town or Countrey with Desolating Judgments, put He first giveth them warnings of it by one means or other, and many times by Earthquakes. A <HI>Roman</HI> Historian ob|serves, that the City of <HI>Rome</HI> never felt an Earthquake, but some terrible Judg|ment soon followed. In the Scripture
<PB N="19" REF="001268_0018_0FB187E5E4D3F698">
before us, it is said, <HI>There shall be Earth|quakes in diverse places,</HI> the next words are, <HI>And Famines, and Pestilences. Earth|quakes</HI> sometimes are <HI>Prodromous</HI> of those other Judgments.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is the Lords <HI>Personal Coming.</HI> He will come in Person to Judge the World at the Last day. The same Signs are mentioned of His <HI>Providential Coming</HI> to Judge the <HI>Jews,</HI> and of His <HI>Personal Coming</HI> to Judge the Earth, because the former was to be a Type of the latter, and as sure as that <HI>Has</HI> been, the other <HI>Shall</HI> be. And without doubt a little before the Day of Judgment, <HI>Earthquakes</HI> will be multiplied, and other Prodigious Signs more than ever since the world began. This Age has seen more of such awful Providences than the former Age did. And the next Age (if Christ does not Himself come to Judge the Earth before this Generation is passed away) is like to see more of such tremendous Works of God, than ever we have done. And when the Great Day is come indeed, there will be the greatest Earthquake, both in a Literal and in a Mystical sense, that ever was since the world began. For then the last Vial of the Wrath of God
<PB N="20" REF="001268_0019_0FB187E7611BA1B8">
will be poured on the Earth, and then there is a <HI>Great Earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the Earth, so M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gh|ty an Earthquake, and so Great,</HI> Rev. 16, 18.</P>
<P>We proceed to the APPLICATION of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which has been Opened and Confirmed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>How ought the Children of Men to Fear and Tremble before that Almighty GOD, who makes the Earth to Tremble under them?</HI> The thought of His Dreadful Power should make all Mortals to stand in awe of Him. When God manifested His Power in a miraculous Deliverance of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> the greatest man then living, made a Decree that in every Dominion of his Kingdom, <HI>men should tremble and fear</HI> before the God of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 6. 26. How Dreadful is His Power who with His Voice can make the Earth to shake? As when the Law was given, <HI>His Voice then shook the Earth,</HI> Heb. 12. 26. Such is His Power as that if He does but touch the Earth with His Foot, or with His Finger, or but cast an angry Look upon it, presently it falls a Trembling: Psal. 104. 32. <HI>He looks on the earth and it

trembleth, He toucheth the hills and they smoke.</HI> When an <HI>Earthquake</HI> comes what does it say? It does like the Angel in the Reve|lation, <HI>It sayes with a loud Voice, Fear GOD,</HI> for you know not but that an hour of Judgment is near unto you.

<PB N="30" REF="001268_0029_0FB187F946DD2420">
Operation of His Hands, He shall Destroy them, and not Build them up.</HI></P>
<P>QUESTION.</P>
<P><HI>But what is the Improvement which we ought to make of this Providence?</HI></P>
<P>ANSWER.</P>
<P>First. <HI>We should be very Thankful to God for His Mercy, in that this Earthquake did no harm.</HI> God has let us see His Power and His Goodness at the same time. Not any Person hurt, nor so much as one House overthrown! God that made the Earth to shake, could have made it to sink under us, or Houses to have fal|len, and proved the Graves of you that dwelt in them. But we see, that He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oth to make us as <HI>Admah,</HI> and set us as <HI>Zeboim,</HI> all our Sins notwithstanding. He has only given us Warning, without Striking so much as one Blow. It was Piously Expressed by a Great King, who being concerned at the appearance of a <HI>Blazing Star,</HI> when some said, We ought not to be dismayed at the Signs of Hea|ven,
<PB N="31" REF="001268_0030_0FB187FA24765DA8">
replied, But we ought to Fear God, and to Admire His Goodness, who giveth us warning before He strikes us.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>This Earthquake should awaken us unto Prayer &amp; Repentance.</HI> So it was with Christians in the Primitive Times; Earth|quakes set them a Praying. <HI>Eusebius</HI> has Recorded a memorable Letter of the Emperor <HI>Antoninus,</HI> to his Subjects, who were not Christians, as neither was he himself. <Q>You (sayes he) would faign have me to Persecute and Destroy the Christians, whereas I understand there never happens an Earthquake, but they go and Pray to their God, that He would turn from His Wrath. And in that, they show more Religion than you do, why then should I to gratify you destroy them?</Q> Thus that Emperor.</P>
<P>There was a considerable Earthquake in <HI>England,</HI> in the Year 1580. Altho' no considerable harm was done by it. The QUEEN who then swayed the Scepter, (our Famous Queen <HI>ELIZABETH,</HI>) and Her Council, did there upon call up|on all Her Subjects, throughout the Kingdom, to be instant in Prayer, that
<PB N="32" REF="001268_0031_0FB187FBA0C28D08">
the Wrath of God, which the Earth|quake was a sign of, might be averted from the Land. And as this should a|waken unto Prayer, so unto Repentance and Reformation, without which Prayer will not be acceptable. They that have Repented, should by such Providences be awakened to renew their Repentance. But, Oh! that Sinners would Repent and Turn to the Lord. As for some of the Elect of God, Earthquakes have occa|sioned their Conversion. They have cast away their Idols when they have seen <HI>God arising to shake terribly the Earth;</HI> Isa. 20. 20, 21. Thus it was with the Jaylor: An Earthquake made way for his Conversion, so as that he began to have serious Thoughts with himself, what he should do to be Saved, <HI>Act.</HI> 16. 30 Alas! That there are so many who need Conversion. There is one sin (I wish there were not more than one,) that is become a prevailing Iniquity, that more than a few are concerned in it, and had need Repent of it, and Turn from it; I mean, that sin of Excess in Drinking. The Scripture speaks of <HI>the Earths Reeling to and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> like a Drun|kard,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="001268_0032_0FB187FE6BD2E710">
I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a. 19. 20. Justly may the Lord cause it to do so, then there are so many Drunkards Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing to &amp; fro upon it.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>We should Endeavour that our Hearts may be taken off from the Earth, and set upon things which cannot be Sha|ken.</HI> The Earth is but a tottering Foun|dation to Build upon. That which men have been Lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uring for many Years, an Earthquake may come and Destroy it all in one Minute. Our Houses may be shaken down thereby; but an House in Heaven cannot be sha|ken. That's a City which has Foun|dations, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 10. And an House there has Foundations; that is to say, it can never be overthrown. Nothing in this World is sure and stable. A man may have a Kingdom, and be shaken out of it; as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> was, and several in our Dayes have been. But they that have an Interest in Heaven, have a Kingdom which cannot be shaken, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 28.</P>
<P>Fourthly. <HI>We should be Prepared for whatever Changes may come upon us.</HI> We
<PB N="34" REF="001268_0033_0FB18800233D7818">
know not what shall be on the Earth: It may be the Providence of God will shake our Foundations. Our <HI>Charters</HI> are the Foundation on which our Civil Liberties stand: What if the Lord should shake those Foundations, in this Province, and in the Neighbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r <HI>Colony?</HI> For there have within these few Dayes past, been Earthquakes in both of them. And our Sins deserve such a Judgment; and there are Vipers in our Bowels, Endeavouring to bring such a Death upon us. We know not what <HI>Shakes</HI> may be near unto us. However, there is one Change, and a great one too, which is not far from us. Death brings a great Change along with it. And it may come suddenly. Therefore we should be alwayes Serving God, that so Death may not find us Unprepared. There was a Town in <HI>Switzerland</HI> De|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">royed by an Earthquake, only one House escaped. It so fell out, that the Good man of the House was Praying with his Family, when the Earthquake hapned. If <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> or any other unexpected Judgment should overtake us suddenly, let it find us Praying, or
<PB N="35" REF="001268_0034_0FB18801A00766E0">
doing something or other that shall be Pleasing to God.</P>
<P>Fifthly and Finally. <HI>Let us Labour to be such, as that no Earthquake shall be able to Hurt us.</HI> Is that possible? Yes it is, by making sure that it find us in CHRIST. And then if it Kill us, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not Hurt us, but rather hasten our Eternal Salvation. A Godly man may Perish in an Earthquake, as well as the Ungodly, but it shall not Hurt him. He will be in Heaven the sooner for it; and what Hurt is there in that? If we are Built upon CHRIST, we need not Fear any Earthquake in the World; Psal. 46. 2. <HI>We will not Fear, though the Earth be Removed, and tho' the Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea.</HI>&mdash;Ver. 7. <HI>The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our Refuge.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is that Lord of Hosts, who is the King of Glory. He is the God of <HI>Jacob.</HI> It was He that <HI>Jacob</HI> Prayed unto say|ing, <HI>I will not let thee go, except thou Bless me.</HI> If by Faith we make Him our Refuge, we are safe Enough; we
<PB N="36" REF="001268_0035_0FB18803F11AE470">
need not Fear. If our Souls are Built upon Him, we are Built on a Rock, which cannot be shaken. All other Rocks may shake under us. I am told, that Two men who were on a Rock t'other Day, when the Earthquake hap|ned, felt it shake under them. But JESUS CHRIST is the Rock of Eter|nity. Let us make sure that our Souls are Built upon Him, then we are safe Forever. Then are we Wise Builders; and it is said of the Wise Builder, that <HI>be Built his House on a Rock, and the Rain descended, and the Floods came, and the Winds blew, and Beat upon the House and it Fell not, for it was Founded on a Rock.</HI></P>

From the Fifth to the Twen|tieth Verse, we hear Him interce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ding for those Eleven whom God had given to him. There are diverse Arguments with which our Saviour urgeth his Requests on their behalf. In special, in that He was now leaving them in an Evil World, and in that the World did hate them for His sake, and because they were not of the
<PB N="38" REF="001268_0037_0FB18806EAA89010">
World; but did Preach &amp; Practise things very contrary to the course of the world, and were therefore the greater Objects of the Compassion and Favour of God: In this Verse there are two particulars Expressed.</P>
<P N="1">1. Christ declares what He did not Pray for with respect to his Disciples. He did not Pray that God would take them out of the world; that is to say, not that he would do it as yet. Altho' Christ lo|ved them and desired their Company in Heaven, nevertheless, He would not have them removed thither before their work on Earth was finished. As long as God might have more Glory by their living, than by their dying, He would not Pray them out of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord declares positively what was the special thing which he requested for them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That they might be <HI>kept from the Evil.</HI> There is <HI>the Evil One,</HI> and <HI>the Evil Thing.</HI> The Evil One, is the <HI>Devil.</HI> The Evil thing, is <HI>Sin:</HI> And that is here intended. Christ does not Pray that His Disciples should be kept from the Evil of Affliction, or that the should be wholly preserved from Satan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Temptations. Only that those Temp|tation
<PB N="39" REF="001268_0038_0FB1880860225950">
might not prevail over them, so as to cause them to Sin in such sort, as to loose their Interest in Him. Sin is said to be not only <HI>An Evil,</HI> but <HI>The Evil.</HI> It is the Evil of Evils; the worst Evil that can be mentioned, or that can be Prayed against.</P>
<P>Wherefore the DOCTRINE to be insisted on, is,</P>
<P><HI>That Sin is the Greatest Evil.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two things before us to be Enquired into.</P>
<P N="1">I. How it does appear that Sin is the Greatest Evil?</P>
<P N="2">II. What Sin is so?</P>
<P>Quest. I. <HI>How does it appear that Sin is the Greatest Evil?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. I. <HI>In that it is most contrary to the Blessed God.</HI> It is an Evil committed against Him; I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a. 42. 24. <HI>The Lord He against whom we have Sinned.</HI> It is true, that some Sins are in a more especial manner against Him. Sins against the First Table of the Moral Law have God for their Object, who is peculiarly wrong'd by them; and Sins against the Second Table have Men for their Object. The Scripture
<PB N="40" REF="001268_0039_0FB1880A8C3D3D60">
makes a difference of sins, according to that distinction, 1 Sam. 2. 25. <HI>If one man sin against another, the Judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?</HI> Therefore the Prodigal confessed, that he had sinned a|gainst Heaven, and against his Father too, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15. 18. Nevertheless, all sin is against God. A man cannot sin against his Neighbour, but he does at the same time sin against God. When <HI>Joseph</HI> was Tempted to wrong his Master, he said, <HI>How can I do this great Wickedness, and Sin against God?</HI> Gen. 39. 9. <HI>David</HI> sinned greatly against <HI>Vriah,</HI> &amp; against <HI>Bathsheba,</HI> &amp; against his own Soul, and yet he said in his Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion to God, <HI>Against thee, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Only <HI>have I Sinned;</HI> h. e. against thee <HI>Chiefly,</HI> Psal. 51. 4.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sin is a violation of Gods Holy Law.</HI> The Scripture giveth us that description of sin, 1 Joh. 3. 4. <HI>Whosoever commits Sin transgresseth the Law, for Sin is a trans|gression of the Law.</HI> Men by sin transgress every Precept of the Divine Law: Jam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 2. 10. <HI>Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</HI> In a Chain that has many Links, if

Question then is, who is most worthy to be honoured with Obedience, God or the Devil? Now as the Jews said, <HI>Not Jesus, but Barabbas;</HI> so Sin sayes, not God, but the Devil. So it was in the first sin that ever man was guilty of: God said, Do not Eat of the forbidden Fruit, the Devil said, Do Eat of it; so that when man sinned, he hearkened to the Devil rather than unto God. What hideous Blasphemy is it, to say, God is not to be Obeyed, or to say, the Devil is to be Obeyed? Yet this is the Cursed Language of Sin.

<P N="3">III. <HI>If we compare Sin with other Evils we shall see that is the Worst and Greatest Evil that can be mentioned.</HI> There are Four things which men esteem as Evils, Sin is worse than any of them, or than all of them put together.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a greater Evil than Affliction. There is more of Evil in one sin, than in all the Afflictions in the world. For sin makes those over whom it reigns to be Evil. It makes the man to be an E|vil man; Mat. 12. 35. <HI>An Evil man out of the Evil treasure of his Heart brings forth Evil things.</HI> Sinners are called by the Name of <HI>Evil:</HI> Psal. 5. 4. <HI>Neither shall Evil,</HI> that is the sinner <HI>dwell with thee.</HI> But Affliction does not make an Evil man. No man is the worse meerly for his being Afflicted. He may be the most Afflicted, and yet the Best man in the 
<PB N="59" REF="001268_0062_0FB18832934332B8">
world. Holy <HI>Job</HI> was so. God gave him that Character, <HI>There is none like him on the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and escheweth Evil,</HI> Job 1. 8. Yet was he the most Afflicted man on the Earth. <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> the Son of God was a man of sorrows. By reason of Afflictions His Visage was warred more than any mans, and His Form more than the sons of men. Yet never was there Man in the world to be compared with Him for Holiness &amp; Good|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s. And our Afflictions are some part of our Conformity to Christ. But sin does the contrary, it makes us unlike to Christ. In some cases it is a Duty to chose Affliction. <HI>Moses</HI> chose to suffer Affliction, rather than to enjoy the Plea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">es of sin. The case may be so cir|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tanced with a man as that he must of necessity either sin or suffer: Then it his Duty to chuse to suffer rather than to sin. When <HI>Job</HI> under his unparalleld Afflictions uttered some impatient words, <HI>Elihu</HI> reproved him, saying, <HI>Take heed, regard not Iniquity, for this thou hast cho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n rather than Affliction,</HI> Job 36. 21. In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mating that men ought to chuse any Affliction, yea, the greatest that can be,
<PB N="60" REF="001268_0063_0FB1883449760AF8">
rather than the least sin. Sin may not be chosen in any case. Altho' a man could escape never so great Evils by chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to sin, he might not do it. Or, if he could obtain never so great Good by committing a sin, he might not do it. When <HI>Austin</HI> was asked whether a man might not tell a Lye to save his Friend, No (sayes he) thou may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t not do it to save his Life, nay, if thou couldest save his Soul by telling a Lye thou may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t not do it. The Honour of God is to be va|lued and preferred above any mans Life in the world. And this is according to the Scripture, which sayes, that <HI>we may not do Evil that Good may come,</HI> Rom. 3. 8.</P>

<P N="4">4. Sin is worse than the Devil. This <HI>Evil thing</HI> is worse than the <HI>Evil One.</HI> For it is Sin that has made the Devil to be so Evil as he is. He was once among the Morning Stars, the Sons of God shouting for joy: But Sin has made him that was once a glorious Angel, to become the most accursed Creature in the whole Universe. Sin has done more mischief than ever the Devil did. It has been by the hand of Sin that he has done all the mis|chief that ever he did to any. Sin has ruined the World. Sin has brought a Curse on this Visible Creation un|der which it has been sighing and groaning for almost these six thousand years.

<P><PB N="64" REF="001268_0067_0FB1883AB80DF9C0">We proceed to the <HI>Second Enquiry,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>What Sin is it that is so Great an Evil?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer. In the First place let me say, That Original Sin is the Great|est Sin. Sin is the Greatest Evil, and Original Sin is the worst of Sins. This is often in the Scripture by way of <HI>Em|phasis,</HI> called <HI>Sin.</HI> It is the most <HI>Sinful Sin.</HI> It is impossible to call it by a worse Name than it self. Therefore the Apostle speaks, as in Rom. 7. 13. <HI>That Sin might appear Sin, working Death in me by that which is Good, that Sin by the Commandment might become exceeding Sin|ful.</HI> If men see another fall into some grievous Actual Sin, they esteem him a very Guilty person, and so he is. But their own Original Sin makes them more Guilty before God, than any Actu|al Sin. For there is in this Sin the most prodigious and astonishing En|mity against the Blessed God. It is an universal Contrariety to the Will of God in every thing. This Sin is al|wayes opposing what God would have to be done. The Flesh is Lusting a|gainst the Spirit, and those two are
<PB N="65" REF="001268_0068_0FB1883D33262590">
contrary, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17. The Carnal mind is Enmity against God, not subject to His Law, nor indeed can be, <HI>Rom,</HI> 8. 7. The Carnal Mind is not only <HI>Inimicous,</HI> but <HI>Enmity</HI> it self against God. This is that Sin which has filled the woful Souls of men with <HI>hatred of God,</HI> Rom. 1. 30. The Truth is, (and a dreadful Truth it is) that Sinners have the greatest Enmity against God of any thing in the world. For they dislike nothing so much as Holiness. Hence as long as they continue in a state of Sin, they cannot but hate God, who is Holiness it self, more than any thing. This Sin is an Enemy to whatever God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pproveth of. And whatever God is against, this Sin is for it; and there|fore for it because God is against it. Thats the consideration from whence the Apostle inferrs the exceeding Sinful|ness of this Sin. It takes occasion by the Commandment to provoke men to Sin. The Law which was given to prevent Sin, is through the horrible Corruption of Nature, an occasion of mens Sinning. If a Torrent of water a dammed up, it swells the higher. Such Torrent of Sin is Original Corrup|tion.
<PB N="66" REF="001268_0055_0FB188268C4FC778">
Hence it is that Sinners are the worse for those things that should make them the better. They are the worse for Mercies. The more Kindness the Lord shows to them, the more do they abuse and dishonour His Name, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 15. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 4. They fight against God with the Blessings He bestows on them. The Means of Grace which He favours them with, the Gospel it self is an occasion of Sin to them, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 45.

Thus, inasmuch as the Law, the Gospel, Mercies, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ictions do occasion men to sin against God more, that manifests the exceed|ing Sinfulness of their Natures.

but it is contained in this Sin, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 19. There is no sin that ever was committed in the world, but that sinful Heart which is in every man, would cause him to commit that sin, if God should give him up to be as bad as that sin which is in him would have him to be. We see that some men are meer <HI>Devils Incarnate.</HI> Some of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, <HI>Nero, Caligula</HI> and others, were so wicked as that if Devils were cloathed in Flesh, they could hardly be more Wicked. Now Original Sin is the same in other men that it was in them. It is owing to the Re|straining Grace and Providence of God, that all men are not so bad outward|ly as some are. For the Heart of man is a sink of Sin, an hell of Abomi|nations. Nor is there any abomina|tion on Earth or in Hell, but it is in the Corrupt Nature of man to become Guilty of it. It cannot be Expressed, what an abounding Iniquity Original Sin is. It is a Fountain of Sin. It wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> said of sinful <HI>Jerusalem, As a Foun|tain casts out her Waters, so she casteth out her Wickedness,</HI> Jer. 6. 7. The same is to be said of the Heart of the sinner: It

is a Sea of wickedness which is alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> working up Corruption, Isa. 57. 20. <HI>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up Mire and Dirt.</HI> This Sin is never idle, but is always working, <HI>Rom</HI> 7. 5.

Ne|vertheless, there is no Sin which is in it self a little Evil. The Sins which men may think are small, if duely con|sidered will appear to be no small E|vils.</P>
<P>Several things may be mentioned, which Confirm the Truth before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Holy God has Punished seem|ingly little Sins after a terrible manner <HI>Adams</HI> Sin in Eating the forbidden Fruit was indeed an heinous Trans|gression, yet Carnal Hearts are apt to think it was a small Offence. For him

to steal an Apple, or a Grape, or what|ever the forbidden Fruit might be, was that any great Evil? It was. And as small an Evil as men imagine it to be, he &amp; all his Children must Dye for that one Offence, altho' but once committed. That one Sin as light as men make of it, has brought Death upon all the men in the world, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 12. And there are awful Instances Recorded in the Scripture, of Gods Punishing seeming|ly little Sins after a Dreadful manner. The man that gathered Sticks on the Sabbath Day, God commanded that he should be stoned to Death for it. <HI>Uzzah</HI> did but touch the Ark, and that with a Pious intention, yet because in so do|ing he transgressed the Law, he Dyed before the Lord. When the People in <HI>Bethshemeth</HI> did but look into the Ark, probably to see whether the Philistins in whose hands it had been, had ta|ken nothing out of it, a small transgres|sion men would think; but the Lord smote them with a great slaughter, that Fifty Thousand and Threescore and Ten men Dyed, so that the men of <HI>Bethshemeth</HI> Cried out, <HI>Who is able to stand before this Holy Lord God?</HI> 1 Sam. 6. 19. 20.
<PB N="70" REF="001268_0069_0FB1883E5F833708">
The Angels that Sinned, what was their sin? Was it not the entertaining a proud thought in their hearts, and for this no man knows how many millions of them were cast down to Hell, and are reserved in Everlasting Chains of Darkness, for the Judgment of the Great Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the Character of a Child of God, that he would rather chuse any evil than the least sin. He had rather suffer any thing, than comply with that which he believeth is sin, 1 <HI>Job</HI> 3. 9. <HI>He that is born of God cannot sin</HI> So far as he is born of God, of as things in the world, he cannot end <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sin; some persons have in their nature an <HI>Antipathy</HI> against certain things, &amp; if those things are forced upon them they will oppose and strive to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> most of their life.

sooner dy, than do as he doth.; or else it is because they are under the present power of temptation: When they come out of that temptation, they will abhor themselves for what they have done, &amp; do so no more, <HI>Job</HI> 40. 4. &amp; 42. 6. When a Child of God is himself, he will rather submit to the most tor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enting death, then consent to the least sin, as you heard but now the Hebrew Martyrs did. And if we read <HI>Martyrologies,</HI> we shall meet with many Instances confirming the Truth before us. One had his life offered to him, on condition that he would give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at one halfpenny towards the building of an Idolatrous Temple, but he chose rather to suffer the most cruel death that his Enemies could in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ict upon him.

<P N="3">3. There is not the least sin that can be committed, but if it is pardoned, it as cost the precious Blood of Jesus Christ, to obtain the forgiveness of it. Not only the greatest, but the least

sins must be expiated with that preci|ous Blood.

There is not an idle word which any man has spoken, nor a vain thought which has at any time been entertained in his heart, but he must lye and dy for ever in unquenchable fire, because of that sin, except Jesus Christ the Son of God has shed his Blood to purchase a pardon for it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the hour is spent, Let me inlarge a little further in some Application of this Doctrine. It is this very day Forty four years since I began to Preach the Gospel in this place. The first Subjects I then insist|ed on, were concerning <HI>the Evil of Sin,</HI> and concerning <HI>the Excellency of Christ.</HI> The Lord grant (if it be

<P>We proceed then to Apply the Do|ctrine. First, by way of <HI>Instruction,</HI> &amp; several things are to be Inferred.</P>
<P>Inf. I. <HI>If Sin is the Greatest Evil, then to be kept and delivered from Sin is a great happiness.</HI> A man had better fall into many Afflictions, than into one Sin. It is therefore a very great mercy to be kept from falling into scandalous sins, such as Drunkenness, Uncleanness, Thefts, and the like Crimes.

A man that is greatly in debt, would count himself happy, if another would pay his debts and save him from the rigour of the Law. Our Sins are our greatest debts: As for Believers Christ has paid their debts, and procured an acquittance for them: Therefore hap|py are they.

How many then are there in the World? And thus have men been provoking the Eyes of his Glory from one age to another for many genera|tions: And for all this, God does not as yet set the world on fire: None but a God of infinite patience could bears with such Indignities. But as for his people he doth not only forbear them; but forgive them upon their repenting and believing in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ: He then forgives their sins freely, fully, and for ever. Some of his Elect have been as great sinners as ever lived on the face of the earth. What a Sinner had <HI>Paul</HI> been before his Conversion! How injurious to God &amp; to His People!

For faith the Lord, <HI>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways; as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts,</HI> Isa. 55. 8, 9.

For there is high Treason in it against the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i|nite Majesty. But God pardons thou|sands of millions of Traitors, and this too such Traytors as have renewed their Treasons and Rebellions millions of times over.

<P>Quest. I. <HI>Who are they that Redeem Time? Or, when may a man be said to do so?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. I. <HI>They that are duely careful to improve Seasons of Grace in order to their own Spiritual and Eternal advantage, may truly be said to Redeem the Time.</HI> God is pleased to give unto men a Day of Grace: A Day wherein He offer Grace and Mer|cy, and Heaven to them; 2 Cor 6. 2. <HI>Be|hold now is the accepted Time, behold now is the day of Salvation.</HI> If before that Day is done, sinners will seek unto the Lord for that Grace without which they must Eternally perish, they may obtain it. The Prophet therefore said, <HI>Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, Call upon Him while He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea;</HI> Isa. 55. 6. While the Day of Grace continues He may be found: He is with|in call; but when that <HI>day</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is gone, &amp; no more within call.

The Word &amp; Ordinances of God are so To improve them accordingly, is to <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> When the Gospel is Preached to men, it is Day with them. This Day will not last alwayes Joh. 12. 35. <HI>Yet a little while is the Light with you, walk while you have

the Light lest Darkness come upon you.</HI> Where|fore men are concerned to improve this <HI>day</HI> well in order to obtain Grace &amp; Salvation; and if they do so, they <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> Moreover, the Lord vouchs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fes means of Grace, not only that so sinners may get Grace, but that Saints may grow in Grace.

Now to lay hold on it, and improve it for that end is a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|deeming of Time.</HI> It is recorded concern|ing <HI>Mary, that she sat at Jesus feet&punc; &amp; heard His Word,</HI> Luk. 10. 39. She would by no means be diverted from hearing Christ Preach, altho' for that season she neg|lected her, worldly concerns: In doing this, <HI>she Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emed Time.</HI> Diligently to attend u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> word Preached, is to grow in Grace. Christ therefore said to the Disciples, <HI>Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed how you hear, for who|soever has to him shall be given,</HI> Luk. 8. 18 If Christians that have Grace take heed how they hear, if they duely improve ad|vantageous seasons for hearing the Word,
<PB N="92" REF="001268_0091_0FB18867E197C310">
they shall have more Grace given to them. The like is to be said with re|spect unto Sabbaths &amp; Sacraments; when Christians improve them unto Soul|advantage, they <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> And so they likewise do when they are much in Prayer to God. The man that <HI>Redeems his Time,</HI> will have his constant times for Prayer. Such an one was <HI>Cornelius,</HI> of whom it is said, that <HI>he Prayed to God al|way,</HI> Act. 10. 2. Because he kept up his constant daily seasons for Prayer, &amp; would not omit them. The Time that is spent with God, is Time well spent.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>They that are duely careful to improve opportunities to Glorify God, and do Good to Men, Redeem the Time.</HI> The Greek word KAIROS, which is here translated <HI>Time,</HI> signifies <HI>Opportunity,</HI> or seasonable Time. That article of time which is fit for do|ing such a thing. Sometimes the Provi|dence of God puts into the hands of men a great Opportunity or Advantage to pro|mote the Glory of His Name. So it is with those who are in a Publick Capa|city; They have greater opportunities than others to promote the Glory of God in the world. Magistrates have so by be|ing a Terror to Evil-doers, &amp; a Praise to,
<PB N="93" REF="001268_0092_0FB1886A34496810">
them that do Well. And the Ministers of the Gospel in a singular manner, are advantaged with opportunities to Glorify God by promoting the Good and Salva|tion of the Souls of men, whereby God will be Glorified throughout Everlasting Ages. Yea, all Christians have Opportu|nities more or less to Glorify God, by en|deavouring the good of men, especially of His People. To do good to men is to glorify God: <HI>As we have therefore oppor|tunity, let us do good to all men, especially to the Houshold of Faith,</HI> Gal. 6. 10. To do thus is to Redeem the Time. <HI>Walk in wisdom towards them that are without, Redeeming the Time;</HI> h. e. Do all the good you can for those poor Unbelievers: Cain them to Christ if you can possibly, by a wise &amp; holy Behaviour towards them. To do that is wisdom. He that winneth Souls is wise. The man that is duely careful to improve whatever Talents God has trusted him with for the good of others, is that wise man that <HI>Redeems Time.</HI> God distributes Talents to men according as it plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eth Him. They that improve them as they should do, are wise Redeemers of their Time. To one the Lord commits a Talent of Riches: he is blessed with a
<PB N="94" REF="001268_0093_0FB1886B63B92C10">
greater Estate than others. The Provi|dence of God sets before him Objects in respect whereof he has an opportunity to do good, by using that Talent. It may be there is some poor body to be relieved, or some pious work to be promoted; now to take hold on this occasion, &amp; not to let it slip is to <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> Ano|ther has a Talent of Knowledge commit|ted to him. The Divine Providence gi|veth him an opportunity to Instruct and Enlighten and Edify those that need Illu|mination. To improve his Talent accor|dingly, is a <HI>Redeeming of the Time.</HI> When men are careful not to let slip opportuni|ties of doing good, so far as they are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|pable, and God shall call them to it, they <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> They know not how soon their opportunies may be taken from them, and therefore are concerned to im|prove them well; which to do is to <HI>Re|deem the Time,</HI> and to do like <HI>Wise men.</HI> Wherefore the Apostle said to the <HI>Ephe|sians, See that you walk Circumspectly, not as Fools, but as Wise, Redeeming the Time, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|cause the dayes are Evil,</HI> Eph. 5. 15, 16. It was then a time of Persecution; they had reason to expect that their Persecu|tors would take from them their Estates,
<PB N="95" REF="001268_0094_0FB1886CDFF405F0">
and all their opportunities of either get|ting or doing Good, and therefore were to use their present Advantages. A Christian that is desirous to do all, the Good he can, and does embrace all Op|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtunities accordingly, is one that Re|deems the Time.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>They that Deny themselves out of respect to the Glory of God and the Good of Men, are such as Redeem the Time.</HI> The Original runs thus, <HI>Buying out the Opportunity.</HI> When a man b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yeth a Commodity, he parts with something for it. Thus he that is willing to forego his Carnal Interest out of respect to Gods Interest, and His Peoples good, buyes an Opportunity. Such an one was <HI>Abraham;</HI> who out of respect to Religion, and lest the Name of God should suffer, refused great Riches when offered to him by the King of <HI>Sodom, Gen.</HI> 14. 23. And thus did <HI>Nehemiah</HI> part with that Salary which of right belonged to him, <HI>because of the Fear of God,</HI> Neh. 5. 15.

<P N="4">IV. <HI>They that ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur to recover Lost Time by a double Diligence, may be said to Redeem it.</HI> It is impossible for a man to Redeem or Recover lost Time in a Phy|sical or Proper sense, but in a Moral sense, namely, when the consideration of his ha|ving lost so much of his Time formerly, makes him the more diligent for the fu|ture. Thus it was with the Blessed A|postle; he considered sadly that he had lost a great deal of Time whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t in his Unregenerate Estate, being Converted to Christ after the other Apostles; 1 Cor. 15. 8. <HI>Last of all He was seen of one, as one born out of due time.</HI> And then how did he be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ir himself?

<PB N="97" REF="001268_0096_0FB18872254AFF40">
space of Four &amp; Thirty Years. The Chil|dren of <HI>Israel</HI> dispatched more way to|wards <HI>Canaan</HI> in the last year of their be|ing in the Wilderness, than in almost Forty years before. Thus when Christians shall do more good in one year, than in many years before, they may be said to <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> Men that are in a Journey, if they have loytered away some part of their time, will mend their pace that so they may come to the end of their Jour|ney before Night overtakes them. Thus when Christians mend their pace, when they become more active for God, &amp; more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">seful &amp; fruitful than formerly, &amp; ripen for Heaven going thither with a great &amp; a swift pace, they <HI>Redeem the Time.</HI> It was said of the Angel in the Church of <HI>Thyatira, that his last works were more than his first,</HI> Rev. 2. 19.

<P>Quest. II. <HI>How does it appear that it is great Wisdom for men thus to Redeem the Time?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer; I shall mention some plain known Truths, which we can never hear too often, nor think too much of.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="98" REF="001268_0097_0FB18873F445DDD0">I. <HI>We may reason from the Preciousness of Time.</HI> When men have a precious Com|modity, they are choice of it: They are loth to loose it. And they would not act like rational Creatures if they should wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t or mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pend it. That would argue great folly and want of judgment. Now Time is the most precious Commodity which men in this world are possessed of. The wise man say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s concerning those brutish men who spend their time in D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bauch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ries, that their <HI>Precious Life</HI> is hunted after <HI>Prov.</HI> 6. 26. If <HI>Life</HI> is <HI>Precious,</HI> then <HI>Time</HI> is <HI>Precious</HI> And therefore it has the name of a <HI>Price</HI> given to it, because it is of Ex|ceeding great worth, &amp; highly to be va|lued&punc; Prov. 17. 16. <HI>Wherefore is there a Price in the hand of a Fool to get wisdom, who has no heart unto it?</HI> When a sinner has <HI>Time</HI> allowed him to get saving Knowledge, but improveth it not, then there is <HI>a Price</HI> in the hand of a Fool that wants wisdom to use it. Men say of some Jewels that they are invaluable, because the worth of them is not known, and therefore cannot be Expressed. Truly, such a Jewel is Precious Time. We may say of it, as it is said of Wisdom, it is more precious than Rubies; all the things thou canst de|sire
<PB N="99" REF="001268_0098_0FB18875FA4530C8">
are not to be compared, with it. We may judge of the worth of Time by these two Considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the things which this world can afford, are worth nothing when once Time is gone. The world <HI>passeth away</HI> and the lusts thereof.

So are <HI>Stage-Playes,</HI> and <HI>Mixed Dancings,</HI> and those Diversions in which Cruelty is Exercised on Dumb Creatures, which some Ungodly Youths in this Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ey have delighted themselves

with; I mean that which they call <HI>Cock-Scaling.</HI> It is a vile thing to take Plea|sure in, or Sport with the misery of Dumb Creatures, who had never been miserable if it had not been for the Sin of men. I remember it is mentioned in the Life of a late Eminent Minister in <HI>England,</HI> that seeing a number of Young men going to divert themselves with that foolish <HI>Pastime,</HI> only spoke this word to them, <HI>Friends, Jesus Christ did not come into the world to set up such Sports as these:</HI> Which struck the heart of one of them, so as that he became a Serious Godly Young man, and forever abandoned that and all such Va|nities. There are other Recreations, which altho' some defend them, it is very questi|onable whether they are not in themselves Sinful. Of this sort are those infamous Games of <HI>Cards and Dice.</HI> Because of the <HI>Lottery</HI> which is in them, the generality of Divines both Ancient and Modern have vehemently Decried &amp; Condemned them. Among many others <HI>Lyranus</HI> has Nine Reasons to prove the unlawfulness of them. But to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t so much time as some do in those Vanities is certainly an hainous Sin. It is a good Rule which Divines give, <HI>That thing which a man dare not

<P N="3">3. <HI>There are many who spend their Time Unprofitably.</HI> Yea, that have done so all their Dayes. It was said of <HI>Onesimus,</HI> that <HI>in time past he was unprofitable, but now he is profitable,</HI> Philem. 11. Alas! there are many that this latter cannot be said of them, that now they are profitable, only the former, that in the time past they have been unprofitable. Who is the bet|ter for them? They cumber the Ground. Such persons may tremble at their Doom; Luk. 13. 7. <HI>Cut it down, why cumbers it the Ground.</HI> And when they are cut down, what will be done to them? Another Scripture answers that question, Mat. 3. 10 <HI>Every Tree that brings not forth good Fruit, is hewn down and cast into the Fire.</HI> Are there no <HI>Idle</HI> Persons to be found among us? Parents Idle, Children Idle. Idle Men, and Idle Women. And how do some of these spend their time? The Scripture tells you how, 1 Tim. 5. 13.
<PB N="120" REF="001268_0119_0FB187A3E1468E00">
<HI>Wandring about from House to House, and not only Idle, but Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lers also, &amp; Busy-bodies, speaking things which they ought not.</HI> And are there not some that Smoke away their time? Time is a precious Commodity that lies upon their hands, they know not how to dispose of it. But do you not know that an hours Idleness is a Sin as well as an Hours Drunkenness? Yea, that Idle|ness is a great Sin. One of the Sins for which <HI>Sodom</HI> was in that fearful manner Destroyed, was an abundance of Idleness, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 49. Moreover, there are some who altho' they are not altogether Idle, nevertheless, they spend their Time Un|profitably. It may be in Reading unpro|fitable Books. Some read Prophane Books. Such as come from the <HI>Stage,</HI> whose vile design is to Corrupt good manners. Others spend their <HI>time</HI> in reading vain <HI>Romances.</HI> It may be if they had spent half that Time in Reading the Scriptures, and Books that shew unto them the way to Eternal Life, they might have been Converted thereby. But what are they the better for Reading <HI>Romantic</HI> Stories? It is meer loss of time. And do not some spend much Time in unprofitable Discourse? Do not they that frequent Publick Houses do so? What

shall be said of <HI>Tiplers?</HI> Prov. 23. 30. <HI>They tarry long at the Wine.</HI> There are that spend much time in the Tavern, or in the Ale-house: They tarry long there. And what is their Discourse there? That which is very Unprofitable, and many times very Sinful. It may make a mans heart tremble to think what account some Church-members will give to Christ at the Day of Judgment, for the time they have spent at the Tavern and at the Coffee House. And it is to be Lamented that <HI>Professors</HI> Generally mispend much of their Precious Time in Unprofitable Discourse. It may be for Hours together not one Edifying word; but such Frothy Discourse as tis a shame to mention. One giveth an ac|count of a number of men met together, all of them pretenders to Religion, but their Discourse was too vain. One in the company more Serious and Pious than the rest, writ down in Short-hand what they said, they not knowing what he was writing, and anon he sayes, <Q>Sirs, Will you now hear what your Discourse has been? You spoke these words, and then repeated them; and to another, You said thus, &amp; then repeated what he said; and
<PB N="122" REF="001268_0121_0FB187AED08537B0">
so to the rest; and now said he, Did you remember that of every Idle word that men shall speak, they must give an ac|count at the Day of Judgment? Did Christians in the Primitive Times Dis|course after this rate think you?</Q> This put them to the blush; they were all a|shamed, &amp; amazed at their own foolish Dis|course. Time spent in holy Conference, is <HI>Time Redeemed.</HI> Wherefore the Apostle ha|ving said, <HI>Walk in Wisdom, Redeeming the Time;</HI> his next words are, <HI>Let your speech be always with Grace, seasoned with Salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</HI> Therefore Unedifying Discourse is contra|ry to this Duty of Redeeming the Time.</P>

<P>By way of Direction.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Let us watch against those things which will make us loose our Time.</HI> There are Time-devourers, beware of them. Other Thieves men will watch against them.
<PB N="127" REF="001268_0126_0FB187B6A0DAB888">
They are loth to be Robb'd of their Gold or Jewels. But shall we suffer our selves to be Robbed of our Golden Hours, of that Precious Jewel of Time? Beware of an Excess in Diversions and Recreations. Some have spent whole dayes therein. Yea, many daye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> since they have been in the world, who never spent one whole day in their lives in Secret Prayer, and in Mourning for Sin.

Thus has many a Young man lost his Time and his Soul too.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Be careful to allow a due Por|tion of Time for Religious Duties.</HI> The Se|venth part of time is due to God by the
