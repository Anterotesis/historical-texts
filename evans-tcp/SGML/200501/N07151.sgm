<P>I once thought these Sands were brought up by the Waves of the Sea, and then by the Agitation of the Sea in Storms, and by the great Hurry of Waters, were carried back again to the Sea; but am now fully convinced that this Conjecture was unphilosophical, and not founded on true Principles: As the Solution of that Phoenomenon did not then appear any Way interesting, my Thoughts were unattentive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or was I concerned whether my Conjecture was right or w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng, but I am now certain, that the black Particles of these Sands are Iron, well washed from all Impurity, and that they are derived from the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land Earth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, as also from other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands; I conclude so, for the following Reasons;</P>

<P>I formerly had an Interest in the Ore Bed in <HI>Salis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ury,</HI> which I have sold; the other in <HI>New-Milford</HI> I still retain, but having com|mitted it to the Care of one of my Sons settled in those Parts; I have in some Measure forgot the Proportions of Ore to Iron, but think I am not mistaken; and can correct afterwards if I find any Mistake.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="009109_0008_1030FD635BE6EDD8">These Iron Particles are scattered in many Parts of the Earth, and carried forward by the Water from Rill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Brooks, from Brooks to Rivers, till they fall into the Sea, mingle with the Sand Ore, and add to the Quantity, or to some proper Bed. Travelling the Road with the Reverend Messrs. <HI>Ruggles</HI> and <HI>Todd,</HI> at the Bottom of an Hill which we had descended, while we were discoursing on this very Subject, we observed some Sand brought down by the Water, nigh a Brook, which it might probably reach the next Rain; on the Top of that Sand there was a thin Stratum of a blue Colour, we had nothing convenient to take off this Stra|tum, but took up all together, brought it to my House, and dried it; there was three Penny Weight of Sand, from which we extracted with the artificial Magnet 15 Grains of Iron Particles, which were in Figure and Colour the same with the Sand Ore.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that as Iron is much hea|vier than Water, so it must be contrary to the Laws of Gravitation to suppose Iron to be transported in Water: If we consider how Iron may be plated so thin as to swim in Water, and that these Particles of Iron are much less than Plates made by Hand, it is not strange they should swim.</P>
<P>As these Particles of Iron were on the Sur|face of the Sand, so they must have floated on the Top of the Water by which they were con|veyed; if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Particles of Iron were much

larger, the Velocity and rapid Motion of the Water might thrust them forward, as we see Gravel and even great Stones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umbled forward by the Force of Water. Since this Observa|tion was made, Persons that are curious and attentive, have seen frequently in the Roads and elsewhere, these Iron Particles.</P>
<P>From hence we may conclude the Usefulness of Water, not only in Vegetation, but also for Transportation of Bodies to the Place of their Destination; so what a Political Writer said of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that they were the grand Carriers of the World, may with greater Propriety be ap|plied to Water. Water not only serves to bring together the Materials which form a Tree, or a Mine of Iron, but also unites them toge|ther; it is the grand Cement or Bond of Union; take away Water from Wood and it will be|come like Powder of Post, take away Water from common Stone and it become as Sand, extract it from Limestone (which as <HI>Borehaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> saith, yields the most Water, it will become Lime in fine Powder; so I suppose, if Water was taken from Bog or Rock Ore, it would become like this Iron Sand Ore.</P>
<P>Many Years past a Number of Proprietors in an Iron Work, being in Want of Iron Ore, heard of a great Quantity in an Island; they sent and found a large Bed of it, but the Water which had fed and maintained it being drawn away, or dried away, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ine was starved, become dry like an Honey Comb,
<PB N="9" REF="009109_0010_1030FD6B80AB2480">
when all the Cells are destitute of Honey, and therefore would yield no Iron.</P>
<P>I was also informed of another Iron Mine at <HI>Windsor,</HI> which was so richly fed with Water, fully impregnated with Iron Particles, that the Ore being taken away, the vacant Bed in a Number of Years was replenished with a new Stock fit for Use. It is consistent with Reason to suppose, that as it is with Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, so it is with Iron, which is a component Part of the Earth; that there was at first, just such a Proportion and Quantity created, which is never more nor less, and hath so continued from the Beginning, and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the End of Time. The Fire dispersed in all Parts of the World, is gathered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd collected into one or many Places, and is increased ac|cording to the Proportion of Fuel, where it is put in Motion; which is vulgarly called a Fire. It is as easy to strike Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e with Flint and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el, or if you have Wood, to kindle a Fire in <HI>Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|land,</HI> as in <HI>Persia,</HI> or the hottest Part of the World.</P>
<P>Water which is raised from the Seas, Lakes, Ponds and Rivers, and carried in Clouds over the Land, is let fall in Dews and Rains, and then returns by Rills, Brooks and Rivers, to the Places prepared to receive it; and as Water continues its circular Motion and Round, so I conceive it is with Iron; by the Water the Particles of Iron are carried to a proper Bed or Receptacle, thence it is taken and wrought for

the Use of Man, and is worn out in his Service; or contracts a Rust and is consumed when it is worn away, as by the Earth in plowing, or from Horses Shoes in travelling, or from Iron Shod Wheels in carting, or by grinding with a grind Stone: The Iron by these Means, re|duced again to fine Particles, and returns to the Earth again: When it is corrupted by Rust; this is much as when a Tree rots, or a Man dies, they Each return to Mother Earth again; these same Particles of Iron then worn away, are not annihillated or lost, but being joined with Sulphur, and those other Materials which constitute Iron Ore, it proceeds and takes the same Journey round till it comes to the Smith's Forge again: Under all these Changes and Revolutions there is no Addition; the same Quantity as there was at first, there remains the same still, and no more.</P>
<P>A Piece of Iron Ore was sent to me as a Curiosity from <HI>Salisbury,</HI> taken from the Ore Bed in that Place; it was in the Shape and Form of three Isicles, two or three Inches long, and join|ed to a Body of Ore like Fingers to the Hand; Water impregnated with Particles of Iron, had ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> down upon three Spires of Grass as Con|ductory to the Mineral Water, the Water from Time to Time drying away, left the Iron Particles in the above said Form:&mdash;Which is a farther Evidence, that Iron in its pri|mitive and original State, is in very small Particles, and are collected and brought toge|ther

<P>To trace the Matter therefore from the Be|ginning; Some Years past viewing this black Sand, the present Subject of writing, with particular Attention, was very much of the Mind that the black Particles were Iron; if it had been tried with a Magnet and was not affected by it, it would not have alter'd my Resolution to try it if an Opportunity should present, having been credibly informed that

<P N="2">2<HI>d,</HI> That notwithstanding the Weight and Appearance of this Sand, he much doubted whether it contained Iron Ore or not.</P>

I do not know what such Persons intend, by Dignity of Writing, unless they can Mean, that when a Person is to write a Letter or a Book, he must ascend into the Clouds, think himself going about something quite different from the common Actions of Life: That he must divest him himself of that Sociability, that easy Freedom, that Familiarity which is so much the Support and Pleasure of Conversa|tion; must now put on a distant and forbidding Air, assume a solemn Mein, a formal Stiffness, as if clad in Buckrum; and being thus equipt is in Appearance like a Hog in Armour, very different from the inimitable Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who relates the common Incidents of Life, in such an easy agreeable Manner, as to engage the Attention, captivate the Mind, and excite the Admiration of every Reader.</P>

<P>The third Week the Anvil gives Way, a large Breach is made; the greater Part of the Week is spent in cutting it down to make a new Face.

<P>About this Time, and for some Time past; having been at Work on a Parcel of Pig Iron, which is of such a sharp sulphureous Nature, as frequently to burn and destroy the Tew Irons, which is the Occasion of much Delay and Expence, as well as Loss of Time; at all Times, and with the best Pig Iron, there is Difficulty and Loss on this Score, though not equal to what it is when they Work those of a sharp Kind.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Remedy may be found for this Evil or In|convenience; the Sand contained in it, I sup|pose to be an Obstruction. The Iron made of Sand Ore, is not only fit to answer all the or|dinary Purposes for which Iron is used, but it seems to be well fitted for, and to have all the Qualities requisite for making Steel for Edge Tools.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> In the first Place, this Iron is soft; the popular or vulgar Notion is, that the hardest Iron is best for Steel; this I suppose to be a Mistake, founded on a Conjecture, that Steel is no other than Iron made hard; if this were the Case, a great Degree of Hardness in Iron would for|ward the Operation; as this Iron is soft, so the heat and virtues of the Ingredients made use of in making the Change, will the more effectually Penetrate, in order to make a full Conversion of the Iron to Steel.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d,</HI> This Iron is pliant, or as we vulgarly say, tough. In Iron Bars there is a Grain, which runs the whole Length of the Bar, which is sometimes visible to the naked Eye; in breaking a very tough Bar of Iron, the Fibres appearing in some Measure resembling the Grain of Wood; the more distinct and connected these Fibres are, so much the more pliant and tough. If this be true in Fact, we see what is the Cause of the Pliancy or Toughness in Iron; I suppose it to be a necessary Property in Iron, to render it fit for making the best Steel for Edge-tools.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="26" REF="009109_0027_1030FDA65AEDD068">3<HI>d,</HI> Another Property of this Iron is, that the Grain is fine; The Particles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Grains of Gold are fine, and consequently connected, which is one Reason of its Ductility.</P>
<P>If I have any right Notion of the Manner in which Iron is cleansed or converted to Steel it is this; that when the Iron lies confined in the Store Chest or Box, the Heat and the Virtues of the Ingredients communicate, cut and divide these Fibres into Angles, resembling Diamond Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Grains which go to constitute the Fibres or Filaments, are fine, so much the the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er will the Angles or Diamond Points be; and by how much the more Plian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Tough these Fibres or Filaments are, so much the stronger they will be, and the Angles into which they are divided; and consequently so much the better to cut, and bear force as in A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and Stone Chisels, where Steel is put to the hardest Trial.</P>
<P>Iron when it is enclosed in the Chest is greatly expanded, as appears by the Blisters that rise on the Bar; this Expansion is the Cause of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a strong Tension upon the Grain or Fila|ments, as to snap them off Short; an hard Substance thus broken short, necessarily forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">to Angles, or Diamond Points; if the Change be not brought about in this Manner, I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onfess I am not able to account for it at all.</P>
<P>It is said that the Edge of an Ax, Knife or Rasor, viewed through a Microscope, appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Saw; it is probable that this is a

<P>Therefore in Order to resolve this Question, and to determine whether the Brittleness of Steel or Iron, be owing to an abounding of sulphu|reous Particles, and for a Remedy at the same Time; from a Number of Bars of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Steel, I chose a Bar the most friable, touchy, and the worst I could find; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aken, and that it might be better than I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I ordered the Smith to try it, and found it as bad as it was supposed to be, and full a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bad or worse than above described.</P>
<P>Having s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cked Lime in Readiness, I direc|ted the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th to use this Lime as they use Clay, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve the Steel or Iron from burning, with this Alteration only, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e should cast into the Fire more in Quantity, than what they use of Clay; and to give it a welding Heat; when it was taken out and hammered, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thick Scale from the Steel, which when broken was white within, occasioned by the Lime that was mixed with the Cinde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; the Effect was, that after this Operation, the Steel was malleable, and could be wrought very well in the common Way with Clay.

<P>I must confess that I made only this single Trial; it hath not been usual with me to pub|lish or recommend any Thing upon one single Experiment: Some Smith's to whom I com|municated the Method say, that they have tried it with success. As there hath been some Pig Iron made of such sulphureous Metal, as to be matter of Terror and Vexation to Refiners&punc; it may be worth while to try this Method upon the Iron made of such bad Pig Iron; the Way is cheap, easy, and as I suppose harmless; if it prove a Cure of the ill Quality of such Iron, it may prove of considerable Advantage to the Publick. Intimations of this Kind, crude and imperfect, and not supported with repeated Experiments may at least give an Handle to further Improvements. The Iron made of Sand Ore seems to have no more Sulphur in its Composition than is in due Pro|portion.</P>
<P>If I am mistaken as to the Cause of the Brit|tleness of Steel and Iron, it is the Practice of melting Steel with Brimstone has led me astray; for when we see good malleable Steel in a Mo|ment rendered as brittle as China Ware, only by mixing with the Steel, particles of Brimstone, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> we think otherwise?
