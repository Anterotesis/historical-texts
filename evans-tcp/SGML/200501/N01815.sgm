<HEAD>A Further Testimony Against the Scandalous Proceed|ings of the New-North Church in Boston.</HEAD>
<P>AN Ordination or <HI>Instalment</HI> of a Minister in <HI>Boston,</HI> in which the Mi|nisters of the Town could not in Con|science be Concerned; and in which the Churches sent unto to give them the Right Hand of Fellowship, have some, if not the most of them refused to send their Messen|gers; And in which after the Ordination, there was no Right Hand of Fellowship given, And in which there was no Solemn Charge given to the Person Ordained or Installed, And in which there was no Ex|press Ordination-Prayer, is a Nullity and no

Ordination, but an heinous Transgression of the Third Commandment; The like to which was never before known in <HI>New-England,</HI> no, nor in the Christian World; But has been a Scandal and Dishonour to <HI>New-England,</HI> and a Reproach to the Church Discipline here, and has a Tendency to Prejudice Strangers and others, and has been an hurt to all the Churches. Neigh|bouring Churches have just cause (accor|ding as the Platform of Discipline directs them, Chap. 15.) to admonish, and to re|nounce Communion with a Church that has acted so Scandalously, except they Repent.</P>
<P>AND whereas they met with Opposition, it was their Duty to have delayed until they could have proceeded regularly and with peace.</P>
<P>THEY have offended CHRIST in a refu|sing the help of a Council, when earnestly advised to it by all the Ministers of GOD in <HI>Boston,</HI> which would (by a Divine Blessing) have prevented that Sin and Confusion which has since followed. Not only our Plat|form of Church Discipline, but the Scrip|ture, Nay the Light of Nature directs to a Council, when there is want either of Light or Peace. I say then, that their re|jecting

that Scriptural Remedy has been a very great Scandal.</P>
<P>THIS I who have been an Unworthy Servant of CHRIST in the work of the Gospel for more than<HI> Fifty Eight </HI>Years in<HI> Boston, </HI>and who have been willing to the utmost of my Capacity to serve these Churches in both<HI> Englands, </HI>being now Aged, and expecting every Day to be called out of this World, account it my Duty to leave this as my<HI> Dying Testimony </HI>with the Churches in<HI> New-England.</HI></P>
