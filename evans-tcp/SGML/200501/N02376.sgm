<P>To which Articles the said <HI>Morrice Cundon</HI> pleaded not Guilty.</P>
<P>The Witnesses on behalf of His Majesty were Sworn, namely Capt. <HI>William At|kinson, Thomas Streaton,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Walker.</HI> And it appeared by their respective Testimonies, That the said <HI>Morrice Cundon</HI> belonged to the said Snow while called the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and Commanded by Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and that he was at Helm when Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and his Mate, were thrown over-board by <HI>William Fly,</HI> and several others of the said Snows Company; But that the said <HI>Cundon</HI> was no ways Acting or Consenting thereto, or to any of the Acts of Piracy, and Robberies, afterwards committed; And therefore the said <HI>Fly</HI> talk'd of dismissing the Prisoner, the first Vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he took, and of getting another Man in his room. And further the Wit|nesses Deposed, that when the said Snow was taken by Capt. <HI>Atkinson,</HI> and others, the said <HI>Cundon</HI> exprest his Joy thereat. And in his own Defence, declared to the Court, that he never suspected the least design in any of the Snows Company, to Murder the said Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and his Mate, before <HI>Fly</HI> came to him while at Helm, and threatned to blow out his Brains, if he stirr'd from the Helm: And then it was not in his power to prevent their Executing their wicked design, because most of the Snows Company were at that time upon Deck, Assisting in, or Consenting to the throwing of the said Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and his Mate over-board: and it would have been a Rash Attempt, in him alone, to oppose them.</P>
<P>The Advocate-General Concluded this Prosecution, in Observing to the Court, That the Prisoner by no Act, discovered his Disapprobation of the Proceedings of such as were actually Concerned in the said Murther; and was therefore by Law a Principal, and Pray'd Judgment accordingly.</P>
<P>Upon which the Court was Cleared, and in Private; And after mature Delibera|tion, and Consideration of what the King's Witnesses Deposed, and the Priso|ner offered in his Defence; as also the Replication of the Advocate-General, The Court <HI>Voted,</HI> That the said <HI>Morrice Cundon</HI> is not Guilty.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Prisoner being brought again to the Bar, the President Pro|nounced him not Guilty; And the Court Ordered him to be Discharged without paying any Fees.</P>
<P>Then the Court was Adjourned to Tuesday the 5<HI>th.</HI> Day of <HI>July</HI> Instant, at Nine a-Clock, before noon.</P>

<P>To which several Articles the said William Fly pleaded not Guilty. The King's Ad|vocate thereupon made a Speech to the Court, in the words, or to the Effect following, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>May it please Your Honour, Mr. President, and the Honourable the Commissioners,</P>
<P>WIlliam Fly <HI>stands Articled against, for Acts of Piracy, Murder, Felony, and Robbery, committed upon the High Seas, and within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>Contrary to the Statutes in that case made and provided, and to the Peace of our Lord the King, His Crown and Dignity; to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e has pleaded&punc; Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall not Trespass upon Your Honours Patience in opening the Nature of Piracy, a Crime of the first Magnitude in the Catalogue of Capital Offences; this has been the work of others more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Performance. What I conceive necessary to offer, is the Consideration of that Hackney Defence made by every Pirate upon Trial, namely, That he was a forced Man, and in order to Strike the Passions they represent in moving terms, what dangers they en|counter'd, as the Risque of having their Brains blow'd, and what Severities they underwent, as Sweating &amp; the like, before they departed from their native Integrity. All which, if prov'd, will not, strictly speaking, amount to an Exemption from Punishment; For neither Necessary, Major Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, or Self-Preservation, can legally justify the Commission of an Act,</HI> Malum in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; <HI>But unmask these Dreggs of Mankind, and then they will appear Blaspheming their Creator, Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing of Oaths, Embrewing their Hands in Innocent Blood, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cking their Hellish In|ventions for un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eard of Barbarities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This in a great measure will Turn out to be the dreadful Case of the Prisoner at the Bar, and Providence seems to point out his punishment, (which I pray God may be only Humane) not only in the wonderful manner of subduing him, but in that he is to be Try'd by your Ho|nours, whose great Justice &amp; Judgment has been sufficiently Experienced, not to be imposed upon by the most sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il Prosecution, to Convict the Innocent, or by the most Artful Pretences to acquit the Guilty. I shall therefore proceed to Examine the Kings Evidences which will In|vincibly prove the Articles against him, and thereupon doubt not of your Justice to His Ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y, this Province, and to the Prisoner's Demerits in declaring him Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Morrice Cundon</HI> and <HI>Thomas Streaton,</HI> Witnesses in behalf of His Majesty were Called and Sworn.</P>
<P>And first, the said <HI>Morrice Cundon</HI> Declared, That on the 27<HI>th.</HI> Day of <HI>May</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">st, about One a-Clock in the Morning, while he was at Helm, <HI>William Fly</HI> then Boatswain of the Snow called the <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (belonging to His Majesty's Subjects in <HI>Bristol</HI> in Great Britain) after he had been sometime forward with several Sailors on Board the said Snow, came abauft, with some of them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> one <HI>Alexander Mitchell,</HI> and others, and said to the
<PB N="15" REF="002819_0014_0000000000000000">
Deponent while at Helm these words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Damn you, you Dog, if you stir Hand or F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t, or speak a Word, I'll blow your Brains out.</HI> And immediately thereupon the said <HI>Fly</HI> went into the Cabbin, where Captain <HI>Green</HI> was in Bed, and <HI>Alexander Mitchell</HI> follow'd him, and while they were there, the Deponent heard the said Captain <HI>Green,</HI> Cry out, what's the matter? and they soon hawled him upon Deck, and were about to throw him into the Sea; when the said Capt. <HI>Green</HI> applied himself to the said <HI>Fly</HI> the Boat|swain, saying, <HI>For God's sake, Boatswain, don't throw me overboard, for if you do I shall go to Hell:</HI> Then the said <HI>Fly</HI> bid the Captain say after him these words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "<HI>Lord have Mercy upon my Soul.</HI> And soon after he was thrown overboard.</P>
<P>And the said <HI>Morrice Cundon,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI> both Deposed, that some Days after the Master and Mate were Drowned, they met a Ship called the <HI>Pompoy,</HI> which came from <HI>Jamaica</HI> in Company with the Snow, when the Captain of the Ship hail'd the Snow, and ask'd how Captain <HI>Green</HI> did; and <HI>Fly</HI> being upon Deck, made Answer, very well at your Service Sir.</P>
<P>Afterwards Capt. <HI>William Atkinson, Samuel Walker, Edward Apthorp, John Cole, Robert Dauling, John Brown, George Girdler,</HI> &amp; <HI>James Benbrooke,</HI> Witnesses for the King were called and Sworn; and Testified, that they were all taken by the said Snow, and that the said <HI>William Fly</HI> Acted as Captain, when the several Vessels, (mention'd in the Articles) to which they respectively belonged, were taken; And at such times ordered the Black Flagg to be hoisted, and Encouraged the Pirates when they were backward, to go on Board the said Vessels. And the said <HI>William Atkinson</HI> particularly Deposed, That soon after the Caption of the Schooner, named the <HI>James,</HI> whereof the said <HI>George Girdler</HI> was Master, they discovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her Schooner, whereupon the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> Advised the said <HI>Fly</HI> to Man the said Schooner <HI>James</HI> with some of his Hands &amp; go in Chase of the said Vessel, as be|fore exprest by the said <HI>Atkinson,</HI> in his Defence made upon his Tryal; which the said, <HI>Fly</HI> accordingly did; And some short time afterwards the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> discovering other Vessels forward, diverted the said <HI>Fly</HI> from his Arms, which lay on the Quarter&punc;Deck; And while he was looking with his Glass to take fight of said Vessels, the said <HI>Atkinson</HI> and others, Overcame and subdued him, and Three other Pirates, as before is set forth.</P>
<P>After the Witnesses had been fully heard, the said <HI>William Fly</HI> was Informed by the Court, that then was his time to offer what he had to say in his own Defence; which he did, by Denying any hand in the Murther, and several other Facts Sworn to by the King's Witnesses: And thereupon the Advocate-General summ'd up and Enforc'd the Evidence, and gave the Law upon the Facts: and Concluded, that the Prisoner at the Bar was Legally Guilty of Murther, Piracy, Felony and Robbery, according to the Articles.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Court was Cleared, and in Private. And upon Deliberate Considera|tion of the several matters and things by the Witnesses Sworn to against the Prisoner, as also the Law thereupon; the Court <HI>Voted.</HI> That the said <HI>William Fly</HI> is Guilty of the several Articles Exhibited against him.</P>
<P>Then he was brought to the Bar again, when the President in the Name of the Court Pronounced the said <HI>William Fly</HI> Guilty. Upon which the Advocate, in behalf of His Majesty, demanded Sentence against the Prisoner. Who was thereupon ask'd if he had any thing to say why Sentence of Death should not be given against him; and shewing no sufficient Reason to the contrary, The President pass'd Sentence against him accord|ingly in the words following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>You <HI>William Fly</HI> are to go from hence to the Place from whence you come, and from thence to the Place of Execution, there to be Hang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d up by the Neck until you be Dead, <HI>And the LORD have Mercy upon your Soul.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then the Prisoner was Remanded to Goal; and the Marshall of the Admiralty Di|rected to keep him in safe Custody.</P>

<P>To which Articles the said <HI>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> severally pleaded not Guilty. Then the Witnesses on His Majesty's behalf, Namely <HI>Morrice Cundon,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Streaton,</HI> Marriners, which Sail'd from <HI>Jamaica</HI> in the said Snow, were Called and Sworn.</P>
<P>And first, the said <HI>Morrice Cundon,</HI> Testified, That <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> were both of them upon Deck, with others, when Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and the Mate were thrown overboard, on the Twenty seventh of <HI>May</HI> last before Day.</P>
<P>And the said <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI> Deposed, That as he lay in his Bed in the Morning of that Day, between One &amp; Two of the Clock, he heard <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> one of the Prisoners at the Bar, say to <HI>Jenkins</HI> the then Mate, <HI>Come out of your Cabbin, you Dog,</HI> and pre|sently after he was haul'd out of his Bed upon Deck, and the Deponent heard some Body fall upon the Deck, which he believ'd to be <HI>Jenkins,</HI> and soon after one <HI>Winthrop</HI> told him, that he should go over-board after his Captain; and he was soon thrown in|to the Sea, where he called to the Doctor earnestly several times to hand him a Rope, but by that time the Doctor was put in Irons.</P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>William Atkinson, Samuel Walker, Edward Apthorp,</HI> and <HI>John Cole,</HI> were Sworn, and Testified&punc; That the Prisoners were reputed Pirates when the several Vessels mentioned in the said Articles were Taken and Robbed; and upon all Occasions acted as such, never pretending to the contrary in the Deponents hearing; only the Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|nents said, that <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> the Quarter-Master, was put in Irons by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> for Mutiny, and so was continued in Irons while the two last Vessels mentioned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="18" REF="002819_0017_0000000000000000">
Articles were taken; and that <HI>Condick</HI> was commonly the worse for Drink, and not able to bear Arms when several of the Vessels were taken; and for the most part was ser|viceable to the Pirates as their Cook.</P>
<P>Then the Prisoners were heard what they had to say for themselves: And the said <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> deny'd that they had any hand in Murthering the said Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and his Mate; but said they had both of them been cruel to the Men, and therefore they had agreed to rise upon them, and put them on shoar the first Land they made. And the said <HI>Cole</HI> and <HI>Greenvill</HI> also owned that they were with others upon Deck when the Captain and his Mate were thrown overboard&punc; and the said <HI>Condick</HI> confess'd in like manner that he was consenting to the said Capt. <HI>Green,</HI> and his Mates, being put on shoar, but deny'd that he had any hand in their being Mur|thered, alledging that he was then in his Hammock asleep. Upon whom the Advocate Replied, That by Law the Prisoners Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ederating and Consenting to do an Unlawful Act in Rising against their Commander (which by the Statute is declared Piracy) and forcibly pretending to put him on shoar, and Death ensuing, they were severally Guilty of Murther, if there were no other Evidence against the Prisoners: but the Advocate also summ'd up the Evidence against them in Support of all the other Articles, and Concluded in Demanding Judgment.</P>
<P>Whereupon Orders were given to Clear the Court: The Court being in Private, fully and deliberately weighed &amp; Considered the Evidences against the Prisoners, and also the Defence made by them respectively, and the Advocate-General's Re|plication, and <HI>Voted,</HI> as follows, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> That the said <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> is Guilty of all the four first Articles Exhibited against him, but not Guilty of the two last Articles.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> That the said <HI>George Condick</HI> is not Guilty of the first Article of Murther Exhibited against him, but of the other five Articles the Court <HI>Voted</HI> him to be Guilty.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> That the said <HI>Henry Greenvill</HI> is Guilty of all the Six Articles Exhibited against him.</P>
<P>Then the Court being Open'd, The said <HI>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</HI> &amp; <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> were again brought to the Bar, when the President in the Name of the Court Pronounced them severally Guilty as aforesaid. And then the Advocate-General in His Majesty's behalf demanded Judgment against them.</P>
<P>Whereupon they were ask'd, what they had to say, why Sentence of Death should not be given against them. And they offering no sufficient Reason to the contrary, The President Pronounced Sentence against them in the words following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><Q>YOU <HI>Samuel Cole, George Condick,</HI> &amp; <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there to be Hanged up by the Neck, until you and each of you be Dead, <HI>And the LORD have Mercy upon your Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Then the Prisoners were Remanded to Prison, and the Marshall caution'd to take strict Charge of them. After which the Court was Adjourned to Six a Clock <HI>Post Meridiem.</HI></P>
<P>The Court met according to the said Adjournment.</P>
<P><HI>AND in Consideration that the beforenamed</HI> George Condick <HI>was commonly In|toxicated with Liquor, and an Ignorant Man, about Twenty Years of Age, having
<PB N="19" REF="002819_0018_0000000000000000">
no hand (as appeared) in the Murther of the Captain, or Mate, and seldom taking up Arms at the Caption of any of the Vessels, but mostly was implo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed as Cook on board the Snow;</HI> The Court Voted, That the said <HI>George Condick</HI> be Recommended to His Honour the Lieutenant Governour &amp; Commander in Chief of this Province, for a Reprieve for Twelve Months, that so His Majesty's Pleasure by or before that time may be known concerning him the said <HI>Condick.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, The Court proceeded to Consider when the Sentence against the said <HI>William Fly, Samuel Cole,</HI> &amp; <HI>Henry Greenvill,</HI> should be put in Execution. And <HI>Voted,</HI> That they should be Executed on Tuesday the Twelfth Day of <HI>July</HI> In|stant, at the usual place for the Execution of Pirates, in or near <HI>Charles River,</HI> so called, between the Hours of Ten &amp; Four of the Clock: And that the said <HI>William Fly,</HI> being the Chief Leader of them, his Dead Body should be carried from the Place of Execution to an Island called <HI>Nick's-Mate,</HI> near the Entrance of the Harbour of <HI>Boston,</HI> and there be Hung up in Chains. And His Honour the President was Desired by the Court to Sign the Dead Warrant, Commanding the Marshall of the Admiralty to put the aforesaid Sentences against them in Execution on the said Twelfth Day of <HI>July</HI> accordingly.</P>

Some few hours after, the said Snow came to Anchor about three Miles from the Sloop. The said <HI>Fly</HI> and Company told Capt. <HI>Fulker</HI> they must have his Sloop if she sailed better than the Snow; and accordingly the said <HI>Fly</HI> sent the said <HI>Fulker</HI> with five or six of the said <HI>Fly's</HI> Men on Board the Sloop in her Boat, in order to fetch her along-side the Snow; but the Wind being contrary they could not bring her off, which <HI>Fly</HI> perceiving, in a great passion, he Swore he would burn her, if they did not bring her out. He or|dered Capt. <HI>Fulker</HI> to the Geers, and caus'd him to be whip'd severely. Afterwards the Boats Crew labour'd to bring the Sloop to the Snow, and they carried her out as far as the Bar, but there she bilged and sunk; then the Pirates tryed to set her on fire, as <HI>Fulker's</HI> Mate told the Declarant, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did not take. Afterwards when the Snow was about to Sail, the said <HI>Fulker</HI> and his Passengers, &amp; Men, intreated the said&punc; <HI>Fly</HI> for to give them their Liberty, who promised them they should have their Liberty the first Vessel they took, and not before; so on the fifth of <HI>June</HI> they sailed from <HI>Ca|rolina,</HI> and on the sixth Day of said Month, they saw a Ship called the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Betty&punc;</HI> Commanded by <HI>John Gale</HI> bound from <HI>Barbades</HI> to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and gave her Chase some considerable time, but finding the Ship out-sail'd the Snow, the said <HI>Fly</HI> hoisted a Jack at the Maintopmast head, in T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ken of Distress, but Capt. <HI>Gale</HI> sailed from 'em notwith|standing.

About a Quarter of an Hour after he came aft with <HI>Alexander Mitchel, Henry Hill, Samuel Cole, Thomas Winthrop,</HI> and others of the Sailors; And the said <HI>William Fly</HI> spoke softly to the Examinant at Helm, saying, <HI>Damn you, if you stir hand or foot, or speak a word, I'll blow your Brains out;</HI> and then he hawl'd up his Shirt, so that the Deponent saw his naked Arm, and went down again into the Cabbin, with some Instrument in his hand, and <HI>Alexander Mitchel</HI> follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d him, and presently the Examinant heard the Captain say, <HI>What's the matter;</HI> and they two soon brought the said Capt. <HI>Green</HI> upon Deck, who (as 'tis thought) perceiv|ing they were about to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ling him over-board, Applied himself to the Boatswain, say|ing&punc;
