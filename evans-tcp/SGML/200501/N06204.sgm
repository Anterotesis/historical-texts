<HEAD>THE CHOICE, A POEM.</HEAD>

<L>IF youthful Fancy might it's Choice pursue,</L>
<L>And act as natural Reason prompts it to;</L>
<L>If Inclination could dispose our State,</L>
<L>And human Will might govern future Fate;</L>
<L N="5">Remote From Grandeur, I'd be humbly wise,</L>
<L>And all the Glitter of a Court despise:</L>
<L>Unskil'd the Proud, or Vicious to commend,</L>
<L>To cringe to Insolence, or Fools attend;</L>
<L>Within myself contented and secure,</L>
<L N="10">Above what mean Ambition can endure:</L>

Nor yet so anxious to obtain a Name,</L>
<L>To bleed for Honour in the Fields of Fame;</L>
<L>Empty Parade, is all that Heroes know,</L>
<L>Unless fair Vertue hover in the Show.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="15">BUT in these Walls, where Heav'n has fix'd my stay,</L>
<L>One half of Life, I'd wish to breath away:</L>
<L>The Fall and Winter of each future Year,</L>
<L>I'd humbly hope to spend contented here;</L>
<L>'Mid the fierce Ravage of a wintry Storm,</L>
<L N="20">Kind Friends to cheer me, moderate Wine to warm;</L>
<L>Securely happy we'd delude the Day,</L>
<L>And smile the Seasons chearfully away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No needless Show my modest Dome should claim,</L>
<L>Neat and genteel without, within the same;</L>
<L N="25">Decently furnish'd to content and please,</L>
<L>Sufficient for Necessity, and Ease;</L>
<L>Vain is the Pomp of Prodigal Expence,</L>
<L>Frugality denotes the Man of Sense;</L>
<L>My Doors the needy Stranger should befriend,</L>
<L N="30">And Hospitality my Board attend;</L>
<L>With frugal Plenty be my Table spread,</L>
<L>Those, and those only whom I love be fed:</L>
<L>The Meek and Indigent my Banquet share,</L>
<L>Who love the Master, and approve the Fare;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'D have few Friends, and those by Nature true,</L>
<L N="40">Sacred to Friendship, and to Vertue too;</L>
<L>Tho' but to few an Intimate profest,</L>
<L>I'd be no Foe, nor useless to the Rest:</L>
<L>Each Friend belov'd requires a friendly Care,</L>
<L>His Griefs, Dejections, and his Fate to share;</L>

<L>Kind to advise, and cautious to offend;</L>
<L>To Malice, Envy, and to Pride unknown,</L>

<L>Firm in Religion, in his Morals just,</L>

<L>Learn'd without Pedantry, in Temper kind,</L>

To him, when flush'd with Transport I'd repair,</L>

<L>His social Soul, should all my Pangs allay,</L>
<L>Tune every Nerve, and charm my Griefs away.</L>
