<HEAD>A LECTURE On EARTHQUAKES.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may justly expect, that the great EARTHQUAKE, which so lately <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This great Earthquake happened on <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 18th of <HI>November,</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5, about a quarter after four in the morning. There was another much smaller shock an hour and quarter after this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> at 5^h 29'; and a thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, on the <HI>Saturday</HI> evening following, at 27' after 8. Since the reading of this lecture, there has been another small shock, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on <HI>Friday</HI> the 19th of <HI>Decem|ber</HI> in the evening, exactly at 10 o'clock; the sky being then perfectly clean, and a very gentle gale at S. W. It was preceded by the peculiar noise of an Earthquake about 3 or 4 seconds, and the jarring lasted near as long; causing the window-shutters and door of the chamber, in which I then was, to clatter. Those of my family, who were in a lower room, perceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d nothing of the shake, though they heard the noise. These are the only shocks that I have been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n|sible of; though it is said, that many others have been felt in the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> Since the first great one.</NOTE> spread terror, and threatened desolation throughout <HI>New-England,</HI> should take me off from my stated course of lectures, to inquire into the probable causes of so formidable a phaenomenon. The subject is curious, and at present engages the attention of many persons; and the discussion of it may help to extend your views.</P>
<P>An Earthquake, you all know, is an agitation or shaking of some <HI>considerable</HI> part of the earth, and that by <HI>natural</HI> causes; in contradistinction to the shaking of a <HI>small</HI> part of it by <HI>artifi|cial</HI> methods. The degrees of this shaking are very various;&mdash;from the small jarrings, which are but just perceptible, to those violent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uccu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ions, which have altered the face of whole c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un|tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s.
<PB N="6" REF="007597_0004_0000000000000000">
These shakings are for the most part (I believe, always) praeceded or attended by an hollow rumbling noise, something like what is called <HI>heavy thunder;</HI> which is usually greater or less, according to the degree of the shake. Naturalists have distin|gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hed earthquakes into two kinds; one, when the motion is horizontal, or from side to side; the other, when it is perpendi|cular, or right up and down. This distinction may, for what I know, be just; and yet perhaps earthquakes more commonly consist in a kind of <HI>undulatory</HI> motion, which may include both the others. For as a wave of water, when raised to it's greatest height, subsides, and in subsiding spreads itself horizontally; so in like manner, <HI>a wave of earth,</HI> if I may be allowed the ex|pression, must in it's descent partake both of an horizontal and perpendicular motion at the same time. And for the same rea|son, it must have had both these motions in it's ascent; but those particles, which had been carried forward in one direction in the ascent, will return in a contrary direction in the descent. This has been evidently found to be the case in the more violent earthquakes; and probably the reason why it has not been uni|versally found so, was, the difficulty of distinguishing these two motions from one another, when each of them has been but small. Though the ancient <HI>AEgyptians</HI> and <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ans</HI> are said to have been able to foretell earthquakes, yet it is very certain, from all the accounts we have, that these agitations of the earth do no where observe any order or regular period in their returns; but at sometimes, recur more frequently; at others, after longer intermissions. If therefore they pretended to foretell them at all, they must have done it, not from any knowledge they had of their nature and causes; but only by the vain arts of judicial a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">trology;&mdash;a kind of learning, it seems, which, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tile as it is, was held in high repute among them. No countries, of which we have any knowledge, are exempt from these agitations; but some are more subject to them than others; and it is observable, that those which abound most with combustible minerals, as fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ile coals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulphur, nitre, &amp;c. are the most exposed to them. Many of these countries, too, have certa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n mountains called <HI>vul|canos,</HI> which are almost perpetually burning, and throwing out
<PB N="7" REF="007597_0005_0000000000000000">
fire, and smoke, and ashes; their entrails probably consisting chiefly of such sort of minerals. It is observed, however, that about the time of an earthquake in those places, these vulcano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> rage more furiously, projecting stones and cinders to a great height in the air; and pouring out whole rivers of liquid fire, which carry such a devastation, wherever they run, as no human art can either prevent or repair. Several such there are in the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lucca</HI> islands in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> almost under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quinocti|al; and <HI>Iceland,</HI> under the polar circle, has four or five, besides the noted <HI>Hecla. Vesuvio</HI> near <HI>Naples</HI> is very remarkable; but there is none more famous than that in <HI>Sicily,</HI> now known there by the name of <HI>Monte Gibello,</HI> as it was formerly by that of <HI>AEtna;</HI> whose eruptions VIRGIL has described in so picturesque a manner, that I cannot forbear repeating a few lines from him.</P>

<P>That the earth has been, in all ages, and in most parts of it, subject to these agitations, history affords us but too many proofs. It is not, however, my design to enter into a detail of the dismal events of this sort, left upon record. I shall only extract from authentic accounts a few of the most striking particulars, in order to give you some idea of the dire effects, which such convulsions of the earth are capable of producing.</P>
<P>Imagine then the earth trembling with a huge thundering noise, or heaving and swelling like a rolling sea:&mdash;now gaping in chasms of various sizes, and then immediately closing again; either swallowing up the unhappy persons who chanced to be over them, or crushing them to death by the middle:&mdash;from some, spouting up prodigious quantities of water to a vast height, or belching out hot, offensive and suffocating exhalations; while others are streaming with torrents of melted minerals:&mdash;some houses moving out of their places; others cracking and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mbling into heaps of rubbish; and others again, not barely by whole streets, but by whole cities at a time, sinking down|right to a great depth in the earth, or under water:&mdash;on the shore, the sea roaring and rising in billows; or else retiring to a great distance from the land, and then violently returning like a flood to overwhelm it; vessels driven from their anchors; some overset and lost, others thrown up on the land:&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n one place, vast rocks slung down from mountains, and ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g up rivers, which, being then forced to find themselves new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, sweep away such trees, houses, &amp;c. as had escaped the fury of the shock; in another, mountains themselves sinking in a moment, and their places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by pools of water:&mdash;some people run|ning about pale, with fear, trembling for the event, and ignorant

whither to fly for shelter; others thrown with violence down on the ground, not being able to keep on their feet; and others shrieking or groaning in the agonies of death:&mdash;even the brute creation manifesting all the signs of consternation and astonish|ment:&mdash;Imagine these things to yourselves, and you will then have a view, though but an imperfect one, of some of those images of horror and desolation, which accompany the more vi|olent earthquakes.</P>
<P>But I will dwell no longer on these tragical scenes. Those of you, who are desirous of farther information, may meet with it in the Philosophical Transactions; <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orp'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Abridgement, Vol. 11. p. 400&mdash;419.</NOTE> particularly in the accounts of those horrible earthquakes, which almost desolated the islands of <HI>Ja|maica</HI> and <HI>Sicily.</HI> 63 years ago; in the latter of which it was computed, that about 60,000 persons perished; which was very near one quarter of the whole number of inhabitants. To re|lieve you and my self under such melancholy prospects, I will turn my thoughts to the theory of these most formidable phaeno|mena, as soon as I have made two or three observations on the earthquakes we lately felt.</P>
<P>GOD be thanked, all earthquakes are not formidable in so high a degree. Those of <HI>New-England,</HI> in particular, which have indeed greatly and justly alarm'd the inhabitants, have never destroyed them. For tho' this country, we know, has been visited with earthquakes from it's first settlement by the <HI>English;</HI> yet, so far as my information reaches, not a single life has been lost by any of them; and perhaps never so much damage done to our buildings as by the last great shock: As to which I would observe.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That it certainly began with an <HI>undulation</HI> of the earth, as I have been assured by some who were then awake; tho' I think it would not have been easily concluded from the effects, that the earth had had any other than an horizontal motion; those effects which were generally taken notice of, being chiefly, if not only, such, as a perpendicular motion would not, but an horizontal one would, have produced. Such, for instance, were the dashing of liquors over the sides of open vessels; the over|setting
<PB N="10" REF="007597_0008_0000000000000000">
setting many things in houses; and the throwing of bricks from off the tops of chimnies to some distance. In order to estimate the velocity with which some were thrown from my chimney, I measured the greatest distance on the ground to which any of them had reach'd, and found it to be 30 feet; and the height of the chimney from which they fell was 32 feet. Now bodies fall thro' 16 feet nearly in one second of time; and the times, in which they fall thro' other heights, are in the subdupli|cate ratio of those heights. From whence it follows, that the velocity, wherewith those bricks were thrown off, was that of above 21 feet in 1" of time. For the subduplicate ratio of 32 to 16 is the same as the simple ratio of 30 to a little more than 21. It will be impossible, I believe, ever to determine with exactness the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> spaces thro' which any of our buildings vibrated, in this reciprocating motion of the earth. It may be observ'd, however, that the shorter these vibrations are supposed to have been, the quicker or more frequent they must have been; the number of them in a given time being reciprocally as the length of each. Thus, for example, if each vibration had been of one foot in length, then th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re were 21 of them in 1" of time; but if each were of 6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then there were 42 of them in a second; and so on. Possibly, some of these reciprocations might be as quick as those of a musical chord.</P>
<P>But it is not to be doubted, that the velocity, wherewith our buildings were agitated, was different in different places. It was different also, as I apprehend, at different heights. This I collect from the observation, that a key, which was thrown off a shelf in my house, was not thrown so far, in proportion to the height thro' which it fell, as the bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks were from the top of the chimney. Hence it appears, that our buildings were <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cked</HI> with a kind of angular motion, like that of a cradle; the upper parts of them moving swifter, or thro' greater spaces in the same time, than the lower. <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">That the vibrations of our buildings, and especially of the higher parts of them, were in fact extremely swift, appears from some effects, which had not come to my knowledge, when I wrote the above paragraphs. <Q>The bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ting of a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tiller's ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, by the agitation of the liquor in it; and the breaking off the spindle of the vane of <HI>Faneuil-hall,</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI></Q> are argu|ments of it. This spindle, if I am rightly informed, was a pine stick, of about 5 inches in diameter, at the place where it was snap't off; and 10 feet in height; and the weight of the vane on the top of it was about 30 pounds. But nothing more strongly infers the excessive swiftness of these vibrations, than the bending of the wind-vanes on some high steeples. One at <HI>Boston</HI> was bent at it's spindle 3 or 4 points of the compass; and another at <HI>Spring|field,</HI> distant about 80 miles in a right line westerly from <HI>Boston,</HI> was bent to a right angle; as I was assured by an eye-witness. This effect seems to be owing to a smart shock upon these spindles, in a direction perpendicular to that in which the vanes happened to stand; which in an instant gave them a very great velocity. The motion from below being given in the first place to the spindles, they were jerk'd forward so swiftly, that there was not time to have it communicated to the extreme parts of the vanes; which therefore were left behind, the remain'd in their former places. This may be illustrated by the following instance. <Q>When a door is half open, and moving very freely on it's hinges; if a pistol be fired against it, the ball will go through the door, without moving it out of it's place: because the motion of the ball is communicated but to a few parts of the door;</Q> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> only those which the ball drives before it. Dr. DESAGULIERS'S Experi|mental Philosophy, Vol. 1. p. 419. The re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tence of the air might also contribute to this effect. The re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tence, which a fluid makes to the motion of bodies in it, is, <HI>coeteris paribus,</HI> as the square of their velocity. When the motion, then, is not very swift, a fluid affords a pretty easy passage to bodies moving in it; but when the motion is so swift, that there is not time for the particles of the fluid to give way, and make room for the mo|ving body, in this case a fluid will resist as much as solid. An Instance of this we have in the book now cited, p. 420. <Q>A musket being fired against water, the bullet was beaten to pieces upon the surface of the water.</Q> And thus in the present case, the velocity, attempted to be given by those spindles to their vanes, may be supposed so vastly great, that the air might resist their motion, in the manner of a firm, immoveable obstacle; which re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tence therefore would be equivalent to the stroke of an hard body against them. In either way of accounting for this effect, it is visible, that the velocity, wherewith the tops of those steeples vibrated, must have been extremely great.</NOTE> This perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ctly agrees with the idea of an
<PB N="11" REF="007597_0009_0000000000000000">
<HI>undulatory</HI> motion of the earth; as you may clearly conceive by turning your thoughts to the case of a vessel floating at rest upon stagnant water, and then suddenly agitated by a great wave rolling under it. In the motion of ascent, the mast of the vessel would be thrown forward, in the same direction as the wave was moving; and in the motion of descent, backward, or in the con|trary direction; and in both these cases, the top of the must would move thro' greater spaces than the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007597_0010_0000000000000000">As it is certain, that in the great shock, the earth had an hori|zontal motion; so it appears with the most sensible evidence to me, that in the shock we felt the <HI>Saturday</HI> evening following, at 27' after 8, there was a perpendicular motion of the earth. I was then sitting on a brick hearth, and felt the motion of the bricks distinctly under my feet. It was not a motion of the whole hearth together, either from side to side, or up and down; but of each brick separately by itself. Now as the bricks were contiguous, the only motion, which could be communicated to them separately, was in a perpendicular direction; and the sen|sation excited in me was exactly the same, as if some small so|lid body, by moving along under the hearth, had raised up the bricks successively, which immediately settled down again. The motion of the earth in this instance plainly appeared <HI>undu|latory</HI> to me; and this shock, I apprehend, was occasioned by one small <HI>wave of earth</HI> rolling along, but not with a very swift motion. For the velocity of it's progress was considerably less than that of sound, which moves about 13 miles in a mi|nute; as appeared from hence, that the roar of this earthquake might be heard at least half a minute before the shake was felt. Which also argues, that the shock began at some considerable distance from this place. The same remarks may be applied to the great shock; only this began with two at least, if not three <HI>waves,</HI> of much greater breadth and height. The latter part of this shock was <HI>tremulous,</HI> consisting chiefly in vibrations which succeeded one another with extreme quickness; and, as I take it, was owing to the efforts of the earth to recover the position, out of which it had been violently thrust, during the undulatory mo|tion: Much in the same manner, as the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iprocations of a mu|sical chord are occasioned by it's endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to restore it self to that situation, which it had before it was struck. As soon as the stroke, which bent it, ceases, the chord does not barely regain it's rectilinear figure, but bends itself almost as far the contrary way; and thus continues bending and unbending itself with great quickness, till it's motion is gradually destroyed, and at length it settles into a state of rest. Both these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; then, seem
<PB N="13" REF="007597_0011_0000000000000000">
evidently to have been of the <HI>undulatory</HI> kind; and to have dif|fered in degree only. <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>I take the last shock, on the 19th of <HI>December,</HI> to have been also <HI>undulatory.</HI> For it's being more sensible above stairs than below, as was observed in Note ^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, is an indication, that the motion of the house was of the <HI>rocking</HI> kind, and this implies <HI>undulation</HI> in the earth.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to observe here, that these undulations of the earth are not to be supposed to follow one another in so orderly a manner, as the waves of the ocean often do: nor that they all move forward exactly in one direction. They rather resemble the agitations of a <HI>tumbling</HI> sea, whose surges rise and fall irregularly, and follow different courses in different pla|ces; and in the same place too, at different instants of time. This appears from that remarkable effect, of some chimnies being partly turned round. One of mine looked as if it had been twisted, quite down to the roof.</P></NOTE> I would observe</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> that the <HI>duration</HI> of the great shock was <HI>longer</HI> than has been usually observed. If my memory fails me not, even those earthquakes, which have brought on the most amazing ca|tastrophes, have commonly done their execution in one or two minutes; whereas this shock with us lasted at least four; tak|ing in the whole of the time, from the first agitation of the earth, till it was become perfectly quiet; though the violence of the shock did not last above half so long. This I am assured of, partly from the observations of some Gentlemen, who were up, and looked on their watches, when it began and ended; and partly from my own, which were as follows. The preceding noon, I had adjusted both my clock and watch, by a meridian line; and the following noon I found that the watch had kept time exactly. Being awaked by the earthquake, I lay till the violence of it seemed to be over, for the second time; for it had a little abated before, as if it were going off, and then instantly began again with redoubled fury. Till then I forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re to rise, because the agitation was so vehement, that I concluded it would be very difficult, if not impracticable, to go from the bed to the chimney, without being thrown down; and therefore thought it best not to attempt it. The space of time, in which I say awake, I cannot think to be much, if any thing, less than 2'. This was the conjecture I formed at that time; though it being but conjecture, I would not lay very great stress upon it, were it not supported by concurring observations. On the second a|batement I rose, and lighting a candle, looked on my watch, and
<PB N="14" REF="007597_0012_0000000000000000">
found it to be 15' after 4. The shock then was not quite over, but the windows continued rattling for about a minute longer, as near as I can remember; for the shock went off very gradually. As soon as I had looked on the watch, I went directly to the clock, which was in another chamber, that I might see whether that agreed with the watch; and found that it was stop'd at 4 hours 11' 35". It's stopping, however, was not, immediately, owing to the violence of the shock, though several clocks, and watches too, at <HI>Boston</HI> are said to have been stop'd by it; but to the fol|lowing accident. Having some time before used a pretty long glass tube, in a particular experiment, I had shut it up in the clock-case for security; and this tube, being overthrown by the earthquake, lodged against the pendulum, and stop'd it's motion. By this accident, the beginning of the earthquake, I conceive, is determined with all the exactness that can be desired; for, so far as I can learn, the first shake was violent enough to overset so tall, slender a body, and standing in a position so near a per|pendicular, as that tube; and it was impossible for the pendulum to make one oscillation, after the tube had struck against it. Now from the time when the clock stop'd, to my looking on the watch, it was about 3'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and the jarring was not quite over, till about a minute after this: So that I think I speak within bounds, when I say, that this shock with us lasted at least 4'. In other places, it's duration might possibly be different. I observe</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> as to the <HI>course</HI> of this earthquake, that it seems to have been nearly <HI>from N. W. to S. E.</HI> I was informed a few minutes after the shock, by a person who was upon the <HI>common</HI> in this town at the time, that the noise began about the N. W, and came on from thence, and pass'd away toward the S.E; and other accounts, which I have since met with, agree with this. Those who were in such clear, open places could make the best judge|ment in this matter; for such as were within doors, or surround|ed with buildings, might easily be misled by the various reflecti|ons of the sound. I am induced to give the greater credit to this information, by what I observed my self.

the place from which it fell; though the situation of it before it's fall was such, that it might have been thrown in several other directions as well as that, had the course of the earthquake been different. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>An account which we have lately received from the <HI>West-Indies</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> very well with the supposition, that our earthquake proceeded from hence sout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">|ward. The account is, <Q>that one the 18th of <HI>November,</HI> about two o'clock in the afternoon, the sea withdrew from the harb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r of St. <HI>Martin's,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">v|ing the vessels dry, and fish on the banks, where there us'd to be 3 or 4 fathom water; and continued out a considerable time, so that the people retired to the high land, fearing the consequence of it's return; and when it came is, it arose 6 feet higher than usual, so as to overflow the low lands. There was no shock felt at the above time.</Q> As this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> motion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed about 9 hours after we had the great shock, it seems very likely to have been occasioned by the same convulsion of the earth. Now if this earthquake went off southeastward into the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> it would pass considerably to the eastward of St. <HI>Martin's;</HI> and it is plain that, in fact, it did not reach that island, there being no shock felt done. The motion of the sea, then, was owing to a great agitation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at a con|siderable distance, in some part or other of the ocean, where the earthquake passed; and from thence propagated to that island. Nor is the length of time greater than what seems to be necessary for this purpose. The earthquake itself, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> rate it moved with us, would be some hours in going from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the latitude of St. <HI>Martin's.</HI> For it has been already observed, that it's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|gress was slower than that of sound; and sound would be about two hours and a quarter in moving to such a distance. The rest of the 9 hours might well be spent in conveying this motion excited in the water, from the place where it was excited, to St. <HI>Martin's;</HI> for the waves raised hereby cannot be supposed to have moved with near the velocity of sound.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted, that we have had no good accounts of the time, when the earthquake happened at different places on the continent, whose longitudes and latitudes are known; which might have enabled us to form a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> judgement of this matter.</P>
<P>A very ingenious Gentleman having given it has his opinion, <Q>that the earth|quake seems to have come from the S. W,</Q> I think my self obliged to consider what he has offered upon this point. His words are, <Q>Most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|counts we have from the S. W. make the shock considerably sooner there, than we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is here, and then it was felt to the N. E. of us; so much sooner, that the differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of longitude will scarce help us at all in account|ing for it&punc;</Q> In which, as I humbly conceive, there is a mistake. For allowing the difference of longitude, the expressions used in the accounts from the S. W. are precisely such as might be expected, in case the earth|quake was felt there as the same instant that it was here. I suppose it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uffici|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tly evident from what has been said above, that the earthquake began with us at 11'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; after 4, within a very few seconds of time. Now our meridian is to the E. of <HI>New-Haven</HI> about 8'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;&mdash;of <HI>New-York,</HI> about 12'&frac12; and of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> about 17'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">;. Consequently, when it was 11'&frac12; after 4 with us, it was 3' after 4 at <HI>New-Haven;</HI> and it wanted a minute of 4 at <HI>New-York.</HI> Now the accounts from both those places are, that they had the earthquake <HI>about four</HI> O'clock. Again; at this same moment of time, it wanted 6' of 4 at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and their account is, that the earthquake happened <HI>between three and four</HI> o'clock.</P>
<P>I do not remember any account of the time, from the N. E; unless that from the vessel on the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> 70 leagues E. of <HI>Cape-Anne,</HI> may be reckon|ed for one. The people on board this vessel are said to have felt the shock at <HI>half past four.</HI> Now 70 leagues on the parallel of <HI>Cape-Anne</HI> make the difference of meridians to be 19'. So that when it was 11' after 4 with us, it was exactly <HI>half past four</HI> at that vessel.</P>
<P>Thus, all these accounts agree perfectly with the supposition, that the earth|quake was felt at the same time in these several places. But I am far from affirming, that it really was so. I am indeed inclined to think, that there was no great difference in the time of it's being felt here, and in the places to the S. W. For it seems most likely, that it reached at the same time to all places which lay in a line perpendicular to it's course. So that if it came from about the N. W. as I believe it did, I should think, that all the places before mentioned, <HI>Boston, New-Haven, New-York,</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which bear almost S. W. and N. E. from each other, must have felt it nearly at the same time. I was careful to note the time, when we had it, as ex|actly as I could; in hopes that, by comparing it with the like accounts from distant places, we might be able to judge, both of the course of the earth|quake, and the velocity of it's progress. But all the accounts of the time, which I have yet seen, are so very lax, that no just conclusions can be drawn from them, with respect to either of these points. To establish any thing of this sort, the minutes at least, if not the seconds, should be made certain.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that two, of the five great earthquakes which we have had, have gone nearly in the same track, as this last did. The first of all, which was on <HI>June</HI> 2. 1638. is said by the Historian, to 'come from the northward, and pass southward.' By the description given of it, it was very much like our late earthquake, only not quite so violent. <Q>The noise and shakes of the earthquake, <HI>October</HI> 29. 1727. seem'd, it is said, to come from the northwestward, and to go off southeasterly; and so the houses seemed to rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</Q> As to the great earthquakes of 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and 1663, we have no account of the course which they went in.

<P>But though this latter earthquake was of greater extent than the former, per|haps it did not much, if at all, exceed it in the degree of violence. Indeed, the damage done by it at <HI>Lisbon</HI> appears to have been vastly greater than any sustained by us; though we have not yet had an exact account of the particulars.

<P N="2">2. This globe is a very heterogeneous body. Besides the two grand divisions of it into solid and fluid parts, each of these is again divisible into an indefinite number of others. Although our knowledge of the earth reaches but a little way below it's surface, yet so far as we have penetrated, it appears to be a <HI>com|pages</HI> of a vast variety of solid substances, ranged in a manner which to us seems to have not much of regularity in it. Here we find earths, stones, salts, sulphurs, minerals, metals, &amp;c. and a great number of inferior species under each of these general heads, blended and intermingled with each other. Many of these are combustible, or of a texture proper to be turned by fire into flame and vapor. And besides the pure elementary wa|ter, if there be any such, the aqueous parts of the globe receive
<PB N="20" REF="007597_0018_0000000000000000">
peculiar tinctures from the beds and veins through which they run; so that perhaps there may be almost as many sorts of wa|ters, as there are of solid substances. Thus, some waters are charged with sulphur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ous particles; some, with particles of iron; and others, with those of other minerals. And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ubterrane|ous rivers and streams, thus impregnated with different particles, may, by their confluence, produce an almost infinite variety of mixtures in the earth. Probably, this promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cuous disposition of materials, in the bowels of the earth, may be necessary to the growth of bodies in it; for in the judgement of some of the most eminent philosophers, particularly the excellent Mr. BOYLE, even the harde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, inorganized bodies, as stones, metals, &amp;c. do, in their proper way, grow within the earth, as truly as vegetables grow on it's surface, or animals in their parent animals. And to the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd seems to conduce.</P>
<P N="3">3. The heat within the bowels of the earth. Heat, it is well known, is a grand agent in most natural productions; and the inner parts of the earth are sufficiently furnished with it. Some parts indeed, as the vulcanos, are actually on fire and burn; but there is, moreover, an heat without flame, diffused through the interior regions of the earth. This is evident from the instance of hot springs, and from the warmth which is always found at great depths, as in the bottoms of mines.</P>
<P N="4">4. There seems to be an inexhaustible source of this heat in the attractive powers, which Sir ISAAC NEWTON has shewn to belong to the particles of matter. For, heat consisting in a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|culiar kind of intestine motion of the parts of bodies; whatever tends to produce this motion in bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es, will cause them to grow hot. Now such a motion may be produced, by the particles of different bodies rushing together, in virtue of their attractive powers; of which that great man has given a very copious col|lection of instances in the 31st <HI>Question</HI> at the end of his <HI>Op|ticks,</HI> whither I must refer you. In some of them, not only a very sudden and violent heat, but an actual flame, is produ|ced, by the bare mixing of two cold bodies together; and that, even without the presence of the air, which we find absolutely necessary to our culinary fires. So in a remarkable experiment, (first made, I think, by Dr. SLARE) when a certain <Q>compound

And by these experiments compared with the great quantity of sulphur with which the earth abounds, and the warmth of the interior parts of the earth, and hot springs, and burning mountains, and with damps, mineral coruscations, &amp;c. we may learn that sulphureous steams abound in the bowels of the earth, and ferment with minerals, and sometimes take fire with a sudden coruscation and explosion.</Q> But to set this curious doctrine in it's full light, it would be necessary to repeat that whole <HI>Question;</HI> which indeed highly deserves it, would the time permit. For it would then appear, that there is a very great variety of bodies, which being mixed together, produce so strong an effervescence, as to emit inflammable fumes. Thus, to mention one instance more, when iron is dissolving in a mixture of oil of vitriol and common water, there instantly arises a great heat and violent ebullition, with fumes copiously exhaling; which are so very inflammable, that, being set on fire, they go off at once like a gun, with a great explosion.

It is a known property of heat to expand bodies, to rarefy them, and enlarge their dimensions; and, when raised to an high|er degree, to separate their parts, and make them fly from each other; as in some measure appears already from the instances mentioned under the foregoing article. This effect heat has upon solid as well as fluid bodies;&mdash;upon the hardest, as well as the soft|est. It is observable here, that such particles as cohere by the strongest attraction, do most forcibly repel one another, when they are once separated by heat. And when the heat is intense, and the particles of the heated body are prevented from flying away, till they become thoroughly hot; it will require very strong vessels to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing forth with a violent explo|sion. Thus, a single drop of common water, inclosed in a glass bubble, and laid upon the fire: as soon as it become hot, will burst the bubble, with a report sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> inferior to that of a pistol. And water in larger quantities has been heated to that degree, as to rend in sander very strong vessels of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, in which it has been endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d to be confined. What the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then would be, of a great body of water's suddenly making it's way into a flaming cavern, whose sulphur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fires are not extinguished but in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d by water; and of it's being there, almost instantaneously, converted into vapor; your own imaginations may easily represent to you. This, it is very likely, has some|times been the case with respect to those famous vulcanos, <HI>AEtna</HI> and <HI>Vesuvio;</HI> both which border on the sea. You see here what water may do; but there are many other bodies, which cohere more strongly, as sulphur and nitre, for example, whose vapor is still more powerful than that of water. This is evident from the composition of gun-powder; a very small quantity of which, when turned into vapor, every one knows, is able to remove any obstacle that opposes it's expansion, and to burst the firmest rocks. The paste abovementioned, made of powdered sulphur and iron filings, if put a few feet under ground, will by degrees cause the earth over it to heave and crack, to let out the flame; thus making an artificial earthquake. And therefore, if a water,
<PB N="23" REF="007597_0021_0000000000000000">
saturated with sulphureous particles, should in it's passage under ground soak into a large bed of iron ore, or a strong c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alybeate water into a bed of sulphur; the mixture would doubtless per|for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>in great,</HI> what this experiment does in miniature. A vitri|oli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> water mixing with iron, if in sufficient quantities, would be followed with the like effect. But no mixture of this nature appears so surprizing as Dr. SLARE'S, which did not require so much as the presence of the air to inkindle it, From this small mixture, which was but one drachm and an half, a force was generated in an instant, by the mutual collision of those active liquors, far exceeding the weight of the atmos|phere that pressed down the receiver; which in that experiment amounted to about 420 pounds. I say, <HI>far exceeding;</HI> for the receiver was not barely raised, but 'with a much greater force blown up,' as Dr. SLARE expresses it. We have no right indeed, that I know of, to suppose all the same sorts of bodies, both solid and fluid, in the bowels of the earth, as chemistry has furnished us with; but several things induce us to believe, that in those dark recesses, impenetrable as they are to mortal eyes, bodies are prepared, by a kind of natural chemistry, which very much resemble many of our chemical preparations, and are pos|sessed of the same essential properties. To be sure, there are not wanting, in those lower regions, all the degrees of heat, which a Chemist could desire for any of his processes. If then two bodies, of the like nature as the spirit and oil used in this experiment, should be mingled together in due quantity, though in the closest subterraneous vault, which neither contained any genuine air, nor could admit any; I need not say, that an earth|quake must be the consequence.</P>
<P>You have now, I suppose, before you the general causes of earthquakes. You have seen that there are in the bowels of the earth inflammable materials, of various kinds, and in large quantities; some in the form of solid or liquid bodies, and others in that of exhalations and vapors; that there are also powerful principles constantly at work, which are capable of inkindling these materials into an actual flame; and that the vapor generated from such flame will endeavour to expand it self on all sides
<PB N="24" REF="007597_0022_0000000000000000">
with immense force. If now these inflammable vapors be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt up in close caverns, so as to find no vent till they are collected in a large quantity; so soon as they take fire in any part, the flame will spread itself, wherever it meets with materials to con|vey it, with as great rapidity, perhaps, as it does in a train of gun|powder; and the vapors produced from hence will rush along through the subterraneous grottos, as they are able to find or force for themselves a passage; and by heaving up the earth that lies over them, will make that kind of progressive swell or <HI>un|dulation,</HI> in which we have supposed earthquakes commonly to consist; and will at length burst the caverns with a great shaking of the earth, as in springing a mine; and so discharge themselves into the open air. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>The extraordinary commotion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the sea, related in the foregoing notes, having happened within a <HI>few</HI> hours of the great earthquakes; one of which shook <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the other, <HI>New-England</HI> with some of the neighbouring parts of <HI>America;</HI> will naturally be ascribed by every body to those earthquakes, or at least to the same causes as those earthquakes are. Now for my part, I can hardly persuade my self, that the bare agita|tions of the earth, at those times, could be great enough, to put the sea into such vehement commotions, as it appears to have been in, by those relations. To account for these things satisfactorily, it seems to me that we must have recourse to such an <HI>eruption</HI> of the vapors which caused those earthquakes, as is spoken of in the passage above. At those times, these furious vapors, impatient of restraint, must have continued to drive along through their sub|terraneous passages, till they found some place, where the top of the caverns, which contained them, was not of sufficient strength to confine them; and there they would burst out of their dungeons, and spring up into day. The eruptions, which caused those uncommon motions of the sea that surprised the inhabitants of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and St. <HI>Martin's,</HI> were very probably made in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> ocean, to the eastward of the <HI>West-India</HI> islands, and near the same latitudes; and, until we hear whether the like commotions were observed elsewhere, about the same time, we may well enough suppose, that the places of these eruptions were nearer to those islands, than to any other land. Now to assist the Reader in forming a conception of what probably passed in the ocean on those great occasions, I shall lay before him two or three facts, relating to the force of fired gun-powder, and the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tence of water; taken from the before cited work of Dr. DESAGULIERS, pp. 420, 421. The Dr. tells us, that <Q>being with several other persons in a great barge upon the <HI>Tham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> playing off some fire-works on a rejoicing day, it happen'd that a water-rocket (whose property is to go under water several times and rise again, and at last burst on the top of the water) came up, when it was ready to burst, under the stern of the barge, being thereby prevented from coming up to the surface of the water; and bursting where it was, gave the barge a great shock, and sensible lift, though there was much less than an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ce of powder to make it. Another of these rockets in it's last rise, stopping under the middle of smaller barge, broke there, and made so great an hole in the barge's bottom, that in a very short time the barge was half full of water. After this, to try the effect of the explosion of gun|powder under water; the Dr. loaded a water rocket, so that it should break under the water, and having set fire to it, threw it into a pond, that covered an acre of ground: And so great was the shock, that several per|sons, who stood round the pond, felt it like a momentan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ous earthquake.</Q> Now if so inconsiderable a quantity of powder, fired just under the surface of water, could have such effects as these; what must have been the com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tion, when the vapors, which were able to shake such great extents of land and sea, as we are sure were shaken in these earthquakes, made their way, with united force, through the vast body of water that lay over them? No doubt, the water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oam'd, and boil'd, and raged with inconceivable fury, and was agitated into overgrown, mountainous wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es. The first effect of the eruption probably was, that all the water, which lay directly over the spot where the bottom of the ocean gaped to let out the vapors, was blown right up, almost like a compact body, to a great height in the air. The bottom doubtless closed again us soon as the vapors were discharged; but there must have been a pit or cavity left in the ocean, in the place deserted by the water;&mdash;of what dimensions it is impossible for us to say; though, from what followed it seems, they must have been very considerable. The next step would be, that the neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing water would rush in from all sides to fill up the vacuity; first, from the nearer parts; and then by degrees from the remotes; and by that means form a spacious concave all around, on the surface of the ocean; the centure of which would be this pit. The motion of the water descending to fill such a pit, was what, I suppose, might draw off the water from the shore of St. <HI>Martin's;</HI> which was the first circumstance observed there. The water, by thus descending to fill the pit, having fallen below it's proper level, would next be raised above it, erecting itself into a mountain over the place where the pit was made; and then by falling and rising alternately in this place, would communicate an undulatory motion all around it: And the waves thus excited would be more numerous, and of greater breadth, as the dimensions of the pit first made were larger. Mean time, the water, thrown up at the beginning in a body into the air, would by it's weight fall down in cataracts, and add greatly to the confusion. A motion like this, once begun, must needs be propagated to very considerable distances, before it could be intirely lost; and that to a degree sufficient, I should think, to cause such great waves, and to such a number, as were observed at the places before-mentioned. Whe|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r this, or something like this, might not probably have been the process of these extraordinary scenes in the ocean, I submit to the judgement of the Reader. And if he shall be of this opinion, he will doubtless make a pause, and reflect on the great goodness of HEAVEN, in causing the vapors to break forth is the ocean;&mdash;a place, where they could do the least hurt. The effects which must have followed, had these impetuous blasts been directed against the foundations of a great and populous city, his own imagination will paint to him in livelier colors than I can pretend to do.</P>
<P>It is necessary to suppose, at least two such eruptions in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> on the first of <HI>November.</HI> For it is utterly Incredible, that the waves excited by one only, however great in degree, or in whatever part of the ocean, it be supposed, could reach to places at such distances from each other, as <HI>Ca|diz</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> are from <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> The inun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ations at <HI>Cadiz</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> were probably occasioned by one and the same eruption, which, by the vio|lence of them, seems to have been at no great distance from those cities. But that at <HI>Barbadoes</HI> must have been occasioned by another eruption, happen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng a few hours later; and seems, by the expressions used in the relations, to have fallen far short of those in <HI>Europe,</HI> in point of violence. From whence we should argue, that this eruption happened at a considerable dis|tance from that island: Because, from the great number of waves, or fluxes and refluxes, we must argue, that the commotion in the centre or place of erup|tion, which excited those waves, was vastly great.</P></NOTE> These vapors may possibly sometimes in|fect

the air, and bring on pestilential distempers, which have been said to be consequent upon great earthquakes. Not that
<PB N="26" REF="007597_0024_0000000000000000">
I can give credit to all the reports of this sort, which have been handed about; many of them having been propagated by writers of an astrological turn, who have been as ready to attribute distempers to the configurations of the planets, and to the ap|pearance of comets, as to earthquakes.</P>
<P>By this time, enough has been said, I should think, to con|vince you, that the earth contains within itself the seeds of earth|quakes in great abundance. And all these things being consi|dered, it may seem rather a wonder that we have no more earth|quakes, than that we have so many. The causes of earthquakes are incessantly at work; and although it may require a course of years <NOTE N="bb" PLACE="foot">Besides several lesser earthquakes, there have been five great ones in <HI>New|England,</HI> since the arrival of the <HI>English</HI> in 162<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; which, at a medium, is one in about 27 years. But they have not happened at equal distances of time.

that they can force for themselves a passage thro' the earth; yet it is reasonable to expect, that they will from time to time be collected in such quantities, and ferment to such degrees, as to make these explosions unavoidable. As therefore our globe has been subject to such concussions from the earliest accounts of an|tiquity, we have no room to doubt but that it will continue to be so, as long as the present frame of nature subsists. For this we may be assured of, that though that imprisoned vapor be dis|charged into the open air, which, by its struggles to escape, has caused an earthquake; yet the fermenting minerals, from which it was generated, will be continually supplying new quantities of the same; and even those very minerals may from time to time be re-produced, as they are consumed; as was before ob|served. Thus we see, that in the very structure and constitution of this globe, provision has been made to continue these agitations of it, at proper intervals of time, during the whole period of it's existence in it's present form; and that in every climate, from the equator to the pole. This suggests a reflection, with which I shall close the present discourse. It is this: That</P>
<P>Though these explosions, and consequent concussions of the earth, have indeed occasioned most terrible desolations, and in this light may justly be regarded as the tokens of an incensed DEITY; yet it can by no means be concluded from hence, that they are not of real and standing advantage to the globe <HI>in ge|neral.</HI> Multitudes, it is true, have at different times suffered by them; multitudes have been destroyed by them; but much greater multitudes may have been every day benefited by them. The all-wise CREATOR could not but foresee all the effects of all the powers he implanted in matter; and, as we find in innumerable in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ances (and the more we know of his works, the more such in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ances we discover) that he has established such laws for the go|vernment of the world, as tend to promote the good of <HI>the
<PB N="28" REF="007597_0026_0000000000000000">
whole,</HI> we may reasonably presume, that he has done it in this case as well as others. To me, at least, the argument on this side the question, drawn from the general analogy of nature, ap|pear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to have more force, than any that I have seen offered on the other. For there is nothing, however useful, however ne|cessary, but what is capable of producing, and in fact has produ|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, damage, in single in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ances. It were endless to particular|ize here; I shall therefore only mention one or two things by way of specimen. The power of gravity,&mdash;a power of such indispensable importance, that without it the system of nature could not subsist a moment, has yet proved the destruction of multitudes. The wind, so necessary for the purposes of navi|gation, as well as to purge the air, which would otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ag|nate and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">refy,&mdash;how often has it risen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a pitch, as to overthrow houses, and wre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k vessels? by which means thou|sands have perished. Even thunder and lightning, which, next to earthquakes, are the most terrible phaenomena of nature, are yet universally allowed to be necessary to free the atmosphere from a certain unwholsome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ultriness, which often infects it. Other instances of the like sort I leave to your own reflections: and would rather observe, that the world is governed by <HI>general</HI> laws; and general laws must, from the nature of them, be liable sometimes to do hurt. However, laws of this sort are suffici|ently vindicated, not only as <HI>wise,</HI> but as <HI>good,</HI> if upon the whole they produce a <HI>maximum</HI> of good; (to borrow an expression from the Mathematicians;) and this, it is in the highest degree pro|bable, all the laws of nature do. It may be added, that as in the animal body, the evacuations, which are of ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olute necessity to maintain life and health, do yet sometimes run to such extremes as to prove mortal; so in like manner, these explosions of sub|terraneous vapor, whose effects have sometimes been so fatal, may, notwithstanding this, be highly conducive, and even indis|pensably necessary, to the good of this globe in general. The explosions themselves, as well as the laws, in consequence of which they are produced, may be necessary on various accounts;
<PB N="29" REF="007597_0027_0000000000000000">
and particularly to the carrying on the more secret and noble works of nature within the entrails of the earth. <NOTE N="cc" PLACE="foot">It is not impossible that some may think it strange to have any thing said, that seems at all to abate the horror which many people have of earthquakes, as if <HI>all</HI> of them were <HI>nothing but scourges</HI> in the hand of the ALMIGHTY; and may be fearful, left the cause of religion should be disserved hereby. But of this there is not, in my apprehension, the remotest danger&mdash;The idea here exhibited, while it exalts the wisdom and goodness, does not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> detract from the majesty, or from the justice, of GOD. And the ter|ror, which an earthquake never fails to carry with it, will be sufficient to secure the interests of religion, so far as they are to be secured by the influence of fear; even though such a phaenom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">non be represented in the most fa|vourable light that truth will admit of.</NOTE> Let me dilate a little on this matter.</P>
<P>By the incessant action of gravity and other attractive powers, and by the perpetual consumption of fluids, the earth becomes, continually more and more hard, compact and dense. Now an openness or looseness of contexture, to a certain degree, in the earth, is necessary to carry on the operations of nature within it. So that on the supposition that mineral, metalline, and other subterraneous bodies grow within the earth, it should seem that the earth must become gradually less and less fit for the produc|tion of them. Since then the direct, immediate, and most general effect of earthquakes is, by shaking to loosen and disunite the parts of the earth, and to open it's pores, it seems agreeable to reason to infer, that this is the end <HI>primarily</HI> aimed at in these concussions. But you will take notice, that I speak here only, of <HI>physical</HI> or <HI>natural</HI> ends. For though I make no doubt, that the laws of nature were established, and that the operations of nature are conducted, with a view, <HI>ultimately,</HI> to <HI>moral</HI> purposes; and that there is the most perfect coincidence, at all times, be|tween GOD's government of the <HI>natural</HI> and of the <HI>moral</HI> world; yet it would be improper for me to enter into these di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|quisitions at this time, since my province limits me to consider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> subject, only in the relation which it bears to <HI>natural philosophy.</HI> It is in the <HI>physical</HI> sense alone that I say, the disjoining the parts of the earth, and opening it's pores, may be the end primarily aimed at in earthquakes, as such mutations in the earth may from time to time become necessary to the production of subterraneous
<PB N="30" REF="007597_0028_0000000000000000">
bodies; and perhaps this end could not be effectually answered by less forcible methods. This point may receive some light, if not proof, from the operations of agriculture. We find it necessary, by ploughing, digging, &amp;c. to break the clods of the ground, to comminute and even pulverize it, in order to fit it for the purposes of vegetation; and we find it necessary to renew these labors every year. Now the use and tendency of these artificial operations may bear some analogy to those of the greater operations of nature, which we are speaking of. And indeed, it is not in the least degree improbable, that such a loosening of the parts of the earth may promote even the growth of vege|tables on it's surface, as well as of minerals in it's bowels; it being now well known, that all vegetables, the smaller as well as the larger, shoot some fibres of their roots to vastly greater depths, than those to which any of our instruments of tillage ever penetrate. This, it is, likely, may be one reason of the wonder|ful fertility, for which <HI>AEtna</HI> and <HI>Vesuvio</HI> have been so gene|rally and so highly celebrated. Again; it may be necessary now and then, to have such subterraneous vapors, as are gene|rated by fermentation, discharged up into the air; as their con|tinuance below, in the caverns of the earth, might be an impedi|ment to those important processes which are there carrying on. But those very vapors, which might obstruct some sorts of natural processes, while below the surface of the earth, may as much advance others, when above it. We know that in many cases of the fermentation of bodies, especially of such dense ones as salts and minerals, air is plentifully <HI>absorbed;</HI> and that in many others, it is as plentifully <HI>generated:</HI> So that great part of the exhala|tions thrown out by earthquakes may be true, permanent air, and designed to recruit what has been absorbed by bodies here on the surface. And perhaps the grounds, on which the great NEW|TON founded his <Q>suspicion, <NOTE N="dd" PLACE="foot"><HI>Newton'</HI>s Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ip. p. 515.</NOTE> that the finest, the most subtile, and most spirituous parts of our air, and those which are most necessary to maintain the life of all things, come chiefly from the comets</Q>; may equally support another suspicion, that some
<PB N="31" REF="007597_0029_0000000000000000">
such particles of air may be derived also from subterraneous eruptions. For among the almost infinite variety of particles which are thrown out of the earth in these eruptions, it is most likely, that if some are noxious, others will be salutary. It may also be necessary from time to time to have the subterrane|ous streams diverted from their former courses into new ones: partly, that different places in the lower regions may be watered by them; and partly, that the waters themselves, by passing through different beds or chanels, may alter their properties, <NOTE N="ee" PLACE="foot">Some wells near me have had the quality of their waters much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the earthquake.</NOTE> and convey new tinctures to different places.</P>
<P>But however these things may be; whether all the foregoing conjectures be well founded, or not: If these explosions and con|cussions be, as it is next to certain that they are, the necessary and inevitable consequences of such laws of nature, and such powers in matter, as our globe could not well subsist without; this ought to silence all the complaints of those who suffer either loss or terror by them; as well as all the objections, which men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ptical minds have been disposed to make, upon this head, to the order of Providence. It ought, in reason, to do this, though we should never be able to point out all the particular advantages resulting from them. For, it is plain, they may be beneficial in a thousand other ways, than we, short-sighted mor|tals, may pretend to guess at.</P>
<P>To sum up all in a word. This is a MIX'D state; in which there is such a variety of purposes, <HI>natural</HI> as well as <HI>moral,</HI> in prosecution at the same time, that there may be nothing, per|haps, in the material world, that is simply and absolutely <HI>evil;</HI>&mdash;nothing, but what, under the direction of infinite wisdom, power and beneficence, is, in some or other of it's consequences, pro|ductive of an over-balance of <HI>good:</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole. How 'wonderful in counsel,' how <Q>ex|cellent in working</Q> is that BEING, who can bring good out of the greatest evils; and can answer intentions, the most widely differing, by one and the same dispensation of His providence!</P>

It must not, however, be concluded from hence, that it is the sole principle of natural effects, and that it does every thing. It is true, the very ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nious Mr. FRANKLIN of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> has, with singular s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gacity, and, in my opinion, with happy success, accounted this way for the phaenome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a of thunder a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d lightning; and has made discoveries upon this subject, which are not only ex|trem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y curio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in speculation, but of high importance in practice. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut this is no argument, that electricity is also the cause of earthquakes.

Not that I here take upon me to maintain a negative, or to assert absolutely, that electricity cannot possibly be, directly nor indirectly, concerned in the production of earthquakes. Neither would I assert this of magnetism, any more than of electricity. I cannot say how for the unknown causes of these powers may be connected together, and with the causes of other attractive and repulsive powers; and therefore do not pretend to know all the possible effects of either of them; or what remote influence they may have, in virtue of some yet undiscovered properties, upon any of the phaenom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">na of this lower world. What I would be understood to mean, then, is this, that according to the laws of magnetism and electricity, so far as they have been hitherto discovered, it is inconceivable to me, how earthquakes can be accounted for by them. At present, we are concerned only with electricity.</P>
<P>The laws of electricity are;&mdash;that every body is either an <HI>electric per se,</HI> or a <HI>non-electric;</HI>&mdash;that electrics <HI>per se</HI> are incapable of receiving electricity by communication from others, and therefore cannot have the quantity of electrical substance, which they naturally contain, augmented; nor yet, on the other hand, can they have it diminished;&mdash;that non-electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s may receive electricity by communication; but in order to this, it is fundamentally necessary, that they be intirely <HI>supported</HI> by, and surrounded with, electrics <HI>per se.</HI> For if a non-electric, which is to receive electricity by communication, or, as it is commonly called, to be <HI>electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed,</HI> touches another non-electric, or even if it is very near it; the electricity, received by the first, will be communicated to the second; and if there be more than two, to the third; and so on. And if this line of non-electrics reaches to the ground, all the electricity received will go away into the earth; and none of the non-electrics will be electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed at all. But if any number of non-electrics touching, or very near, one another, be terminated on all sides by electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, they may then receive and retain electricity for some time. For the electric supporters, being incapable of receiving this communicated elec|tricity, stop the progress of it, and confine it to the non-electrics. All this will appear plainer, especially to those who have seen electric experiments, by sing|ling out a particular instance. Thus, a met<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e tube, such as is commonly used is electric experiments, and is called a <HI>conductor,</HI> is a non-electric, and is inca|pable of being rendered electrical, by any action immediately upon it. A glass globe is an electric <HI>per se,</HI> and may have it's electricity excited by rubbing it;
<PB N="34" REF="007597_0032_0000000000000000">
and if it be very near the non-electric conductor, it will communicate it's elec|tric virtue to that, provided the conductor be properly supported. It must be supported by nothing but electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>per se,</HI> such as glass, wax, rosin, &amp;c&punc; or by lines of silk or hair. Such supporters, as they cannot receive the virtue from the glass globe, will stop it from running off the conductor, which by that means be|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mes electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. But if the conductor be not intirely supported in this manner; if there be the smallest line of communication, by the intervention of non-elec|trics, between the conductor and the earth, altho' it were but the finest wire, of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d of hemp or flax, or any thing that is wet; all the electricity, given by the globe to the conductor, will run off that way, and be lost in the earth; and the conductor will show no signs of electricity at all. It is known also, that the air, which surrounds this earth, is an electric <HI>per se;</HI> as appears from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, among other considerations, that if it were non-electric, it would be impossible for us ever to electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a conductor, or any thing else; unless it were placed in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> For in that case, all the virtue, given to the conductor, would run off by the air; as, in damp weather, it does by the watery vapors floating in the air, which are non-electric bodies. It was before observed, that electrics cannot have their share of the electric substance increased or diminished; but non-electrics may, when duly supported: And the whole effect of abundance of the electric experiments, that are made in <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urses,</HI> is nothing more than this; that when one non electric is brought within a certain distance, called the <HI>strik|ing distance,</HI> of another non-electric, which contains a different proportion of the electric substance from the former; that which contains the most will impart so much to that which contains the least, as to make it equal in both. And the transition of the electric substance, from one of these bodies to the other, will be attended with a flash and a report; which will be greater, in proportion as the absolute quantity of the electric matter accumulated in one of the bodies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> greater, and as the difference between the quantities in the bodies imparting and receiving is greater. And much in the same proportion will the striking distance be greater too.</P>
<P>It is easy now to see, that, though lightning may be accounted for upon these principles, earthquakes cannot. For clouds, which are collections of watery, that is, of non-electric vapors, being <HI>intirely supported and surrounded by air,</HI> which is an electric <HI>per se,</HI> are capable of having more or less than their natural quantity of the electric substance. And therefore, when a cloud, containing more or less than it's natural quantity of the electric substance, approaches the earth; or when two clouds, containing unequal quantities of this substance, approach one another; the consequence will be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a discharge of electric sub|stance from that body which contained the most of it, into that which con|tained the least, till it becomes equally divided between them; which discharge will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ompanied with a flash of lightning and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of thunder. But where is the <HI>analogy</HI> between this case in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and what may be supposed to pass in the bowels of the earth, to cause earthquakes? to make out any thing like an analogy, we must suppose, <HI>first,</HI> two huge non-electric bodies under ground,
<PB N="35" REF="007597_0033_0000000000000000">
which, for some earthquakes, must be hundreds, if not thousands, of miles in extent; and <HI>secondly,</HI> that each of these non-electrics is <HI>intirely supported and surrounded by electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> per se. The <HI>first</HI> of these suppositions has no difficulty in it; because this terraqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ous globe consists almost wholly of non-electrics; but where to find such electric supporters for these vast conductors, as are re|quired in the <HI>second,</HI> in a point, I humbly conceive, attended with very great difficulty. And yet, without this, it is impossible that either of these non-ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rics can have more or less than it's own natural quantity of electric sub|stance. For though we were told of its <Q>waving about in different parties in the earth below,</Q> yet there can be no such thing; unless the <HI>'Divine Di|rection,'</HI> here introduced, should in this case suspend or set aside the established laws of nature: that is, should act <HI>miracul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sly.</HI> But this will hardly be sup|posed: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to have recourse to <HI>miraculous</HI> interpositions of the 'Divine Direction,' is to put an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> end at once to all reasoning<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> about electricity, or earthquakes, or any other natural phaenomena. There can therefore, I say, be no such thing as this <Q>waving about of the electric substance in different Parties in the earth below,</Q> so long as the 'Divine Direction' continues to operate according to the established laws of electricity: It being a certain truth, that whatever quantity of this electric substance is communicated to any non-electric body, it is equally diffused in an instant throughout the whole of that body. Thus, the virtue of the glass globe, though applied only to one end of the conductor, is in a moment spread all over it, and throughout it; and the conductor becomes equally electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in every part. There can, therefore, be no inequality of electric substance in the non-electric bodies of which this globe is composed, excepting only in those which are intirely surrounded by electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>per se.</HI> Through all the rest of the globe, the electric substance will be equally and uniformly diffused. Now if we could even find electric <HI>supporters</HI> for these vast <HI>conductors</HI> of a thousand or two miles in extent, a very great difficulty would still remain, which is, that this very circumstance of having electric support|ers on all sides, without which no non-electric can have more than it's own natu|ral quantity of electric substance thrown into it, nor any withdrawn from it, will, in the bowels of the earth, effectually prevent either of these alterations. The reason of this will appear plainer, I believe, by a particular instance, than by a long explanation. Suppose a glass bottle of water to be shut up perfectly tight with a glass stopple. Here will be a non-electric intirely surrounded with an electric. If this water had more than it's natural quantity of electric substance thrown into it, before it was stop'd up, the glass covering would keep it in; or if it had less, the same covering would prevent more from entring into it out of the neighbouring bodies. After the bottle is stop'd, the glass, which now surrounds the water on all sides, by cutting off all communication be|tween the water within the bottle and other non-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lectrics without, is an effec|tual bar in the way of any alteration. No more of the electric substance can, after this, enter into the bottle, or come out of it. And thus if, in the bow|el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the earth, there be a non-electric <HI>intirely surrounded</HI> with electri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, it
<PB N="36" REF="007597_0034_0000000000000000">
can have no additional quantity of electric substance thrown into it, nor any drawn out of it; the electrics, which surround it, preventing the passage of this electric substance, either from without, inwards; or from within, outwards. And the case will be the same, if the non-electric be <HI>not intir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly surrounded</HI> with electrics. For then, if any quantity of the electric substance were attempted to be thrown into the non-electric, it would not remain there, but would instantly spread itself into the neighbouring non-electric bodies; and if any were attempt|ed to be drawn out, it's place would be immediately supplied out of the neigh|bouring bodies. Thus it appears, that there can be <Q>no unequal distribution of this substance in the earth;</Q> and consequently, by this Gentleman's own confession in p. 20, 'nothing to produce any concu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ions there.'</P>
<P>For brevity's sake, I have insisted only on this single circumstance of the ne|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ty of electric supporters. When this difficulty is cleared up, there ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> others to be offered.</P>
<P>But the most exceptionable part is yet to come. It is the Postscript in p. 23. which runs thus.</P>
<P><Q>P. S. The more <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ints</HI> of <HI>Iron</HI> are er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted round the <HI>Earth,</HI> to draw the <HI>Electrical Substance</HI> out of the <HI>Air;</HI> the more the <HI>Earth</HI> must needs be charged with-it. And therefore it seems worthy of Consideration&punc; Whether <HI>any Part</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> being fuller of <HI>this terri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Substance,</HI> may not be more exposed to <HI>more sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Earthquakes.</HI> In <HI>Boston</HI> are more e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cted than any where else in <HI>New-England:</HI> and <HI>Boston</HI> seems to be more dreadfully shaken. O! there is no getting out of the mighty Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of GOD! If we think to avoid it in the <HI>Air,</HI> we cannot in the <HI>Earth:</HI> Yea it may grow more fatal.</Q> When I first read this Postscript, I was both s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rprised and concerned:&mdash;sur|prised, to find so many mistakes in so few lines; and concerned, for the ill effects it would probably have. For I could see no other effects of it, but that it would fill with unnecessary terrors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> minds of many persons, who were not well enough acquainted with the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> electricity, to discover the mistakes: And that it would discourage the use of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> iron-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ints,</HI> which were erecting in <HI>Boston</HI> and elsewhere; and which, by the blessing of GOD, might be a means of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eventing many of those mischievous and sorrowful accidents, which we have so often seen to follow upon thunder storms. In order therefore to guard, as much as I can, against the ill effects just mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, I shall now lay open, though as briefly as possible, the principal of these mistakes.</P>
<P N="1">1. Strictly speaking, it is a mistake to say, that <Q>points of iron erected round the earth draw the electrical substance out of the <HI>air.</HI></Q> For the air, being an electric <HI>per se,</HI> obstinately retains it's own quantity of this substance&punc; and will not part with it to any other body. They do indeed draw it out of the <HI>clouds</HI> in the air; which, being non-electrics, can part with some of it. But even this they must be said to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, only in a qualified sense; and not so univer|sally, as the first words of this P. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eem to intimate. For</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="007597_0035_0000000000000000">2dly, I appeal to every Reader, whether the idea, most obviously conveyed by those words, be not this, that these iron points do, by a <HI>constant and perpe|tual action,</HI> keep drawing the electric substance out of the air, and overcharging the earth with it. Now this is far from being the case. They never draw it out of the air, or, more properly, out of the clouds in the air, but when those clouds have more than their due quantity of it, and the earth, less; and con|sequently, it is impossible, that they should ever overcharge the earth with it at all. The only thing they can do is, to restore to the earth it's just quan|tity, when it is undercharged. But supposing they did constantly draw this electric substance out of the air into the earth, yet.</P>
<P>3dly, They could never fill <Q><HI>any part</HI> of the <HI>earth</HI> fuller of <HI>this terrible substance</HI></Q>; nor consequently <Q>expose any one part more than another to <HI>more shocking earthquakes.</HI></Q> For how much soever of this terrible substance be sup|posed drawn out of the air into any particular part of the earth, it cannot re|main collected there, but will instantly spread itself all around into the neigh|bouring parts which have less of it, and thus will be restored to an equality every where.</P>
<P>4thly. I know no reason to think, that '<HI>Boston</HI> was more dreadfully shaken' than other towns. Some of the effects of the earthquakes may have been more considerable, for their number, there than elsewhere; but the reason of this is, not that <Q>in <HI>Boston</HI> are more <HI>points</HI> of <HI>iron</HI> erected than any where else in <HI>New-England,</HI></Q>, but that there are more <HI>brick houses</HI> erected there. For the effect of a shock is more considerable upon brick-work than upon wood-work. The reasons of this are obvious; and that it is so in fact, plainly appeared by our chimnies being every where more shattered than any thing else: Though this was in part owing to their being the highest parts of buildings.</P>
<P>5thly. I should think, though with the utmost deference to superior judge|ments, that the pathetic exclamation, which comes next, might well enough have been spared. 'O! there is no getting out of the mighty hand of GOD!' For I cannot believe, that in the whole town of <HI>Boston,</HI> where so many iron points are erected, there is so much as one person, who is so weak, so ignorant, so foolish, or, to say all in one word, so athei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tical, as ever to have entertained a single thought, that it is possible, by the help of a few yards of wire, to 'get out of the mighty hand of GOD.'</P>
<P>6thly. The postscript proceeds. 'If we think to avoid it' [the mighty hand of God] <Q>in the <HI>Air,</HI> we cannot in the <HI>Earth:</HI> Yea it may grown more fatal.</Q> Upon which I observe, that if the hypothesis in question were right; if earthquakes were indeed caused by <Q>any parts of the earth being fuller of <HI>this terrible substance</HI></Q> than they ought to be; it would follow, not that iron points make 'the mighty hand of God grow more fatal', or 'expose those parts to more shocking earthquakes;' as is here most groundlessly insinuated: But it would follow, that iron points would be of great and most admirable use, in preventing earthquakes as well as thunder and lightning. For it must be
<PB N="38" REF="007597_0036_0000000000000000">
observed, that these iron points have, not only a power of <HI>drawing</HI> electric substance out of the clouds into the earth, but an equal power of <HI>throwing off</HI> this same substance out of the earth into the clouds; which latter power they exert, as often as the former: according to Mr. FRANKLIN'S observations, to whom we are indebted for the discovery of <HI>both</HI> these powers of points. This latter power the Postscript has intirely overlooked. The truth is: If a cloud have more than it's due quantity of electric substance, these points will draw the redundant part of it down into the earth; but if it have less, the points will <HI>throw off</HI> enough out of the earth into the cloud to supply the deficiency. If then it were possi|ble for earthquakes to be caused by the earth's being more charged with electric substance than it should be, and the air's being charged less; the iron points would stand ready to <HI>throw off</HI> the superfluous part from the earth into the upper regions of the air; and thus, by removing the cause of earthquakes, would take away the effect.</P>
<P>I have now considered what this remarkable Postscript tells us 'seems wor|thy of consideration.' I have taken no notice of several other things in this piece which seem liable to just exception; but hope I have fully vindicated the character of these innocent and injured <HI>iron-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ints;</HI> and have shewed, that all apprehen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ons of danger arising from them are perfectly groundless and chimerical.</P>
