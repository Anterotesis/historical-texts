When the commissioners pressed her to submit to the queen's pleasure, otherwise they would proceed against her as contuma|cious, she declared she would rather suffer a thousand deaths, than own herself a subject to any prince on earth. That however she was rea|dy to vindicate herself in a full and free parliament, as for aught she knew, this meeting of commissioners was devised against her life, on purpose to take it away with a pretext of justice. She exhorted them to consult their own consciences, and to remember that the theatre of the world was much more extensive than that of the kingdom of England. At length the vice-chamberlain Hatton vanquished her objec|tions, by representing that she injured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her innocence might be proved to the satisfaction of all mankind. This observation made such an impression upon her, that she agreed to plead, if they would admit and allow her protest, of disallowing all subjection. This, however, they refused; but they satis|fied her, by entering it upon record, and thus they proceeded to trial.</P>

<L>Explor'd the vale of solitude. A rill,</L>
